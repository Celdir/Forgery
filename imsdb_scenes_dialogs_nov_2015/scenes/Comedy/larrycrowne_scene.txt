FADE IN

Big and orange and full of hope, as sure as fate. A dawn as

promising as, well, this new day...

Sun is rising over...

A flat roof that stretches to the horizon. A vast expanse.

A plain of gravel-embedded tar, studded with...

HVAC units and power lines, the kind that service a huge

commercial building. In fact this kind of building...

A UNIMART store. A flagship of savings; a mother lode of

low, low prices. 100,000-and-then-some square feet of the

Consumer Economy...

Empty thus far. A few EMPLOYEE autos arriving in their

assigned slots far from the entrance. One of those cars is a

old, not so vintage nor classic convertible...

KARMANN GHIA -- Belonging to...

LARRY CROWNE - A man as reliable (and predictable) as that

rising sun.

Actually, he's a Team Leader of this Unimart, dressed in his

un-sexy, un-fashionable, un-flattering khaki pants and

Company Polo.

Larry has had the ragtop down. He wrestles it up, locks the

cover into place.

He doesn't just walk to work, but s t r i d e s across the

asphalt field like a Sultan of Sales; a Viscount of Discount.

He cheers co-workers at the start of the day, shouting

encouragement, flashing thumbs up, knocking on car doors and

squeezing shoulders...

2.

INT. UNIMART - DAY

The morning Circle of Sales! Employees and their wares.

Larry stands, yet to speak, ready for his moment of

pronounced enthusiasm...

Go, Larry! Wave that merchandise!

FREEZE!

Words fill the screen.

Hold. Hold. Hold. AND...CONTINUE.

Larry Crowne leads the High Fives.

MENSWEAR DEPT - LATER

Larry controlling the aisles like an Admiral at a Battle

Map... stacking a mountain of tube socks... stocking those

briefs ... hanging "Metallica" Speedos on little hangers...

helping CUBBY - a very skinny and disinterested Janitor -

clean up some baby up-chuck as the baby up-chucks again.

Imagine any duty and see how Larry gets it done...

EXT. UNIMART PARKING LOT - LATER

Larry is collecting loose shopping carts, steering them into

pairs, triplets, sextuplets, then riding them into the cart

pen like a Trail Boss...

That same up-chucking baby was riding on the coin-pony and up-

chucked again. Larry is cleaning it all up.

A beat-up CAR with a BIG STORK PIZZA sign stuck on its roof

pulls right up to the front of the store, parking in the

Handicapped Space.

INT. MEETING ROOM 2 - UNIMART - LATER

The BIG STORK PIZZA BOXES have been raided for slices.

A RETIREMENT PARTY is going on. A SIGN reads "Good Luck

Dorothy Genkos!" The name has been printed over the last

person to retire. People are cutting loose as best they can

at a NO-ALCOHOL Corporate Fete.

None more than Larry. Who is organizing a MOSH PIT for

DOROTHY GENKOS, an old lady. This is a fun group.

Over in the corner, though, is the Front Office Staff: COX,

STRANG, ANDREWS and HURLEY (Female).

Hurley is shocked!

Hurley looks sick. She hates this.

Strang rolls his eyes.

AVERY - Old. Black. Happy.

ALVAREZ - Heavy with child.

They all agree: "Yeah. Sure. Of course..."

Larry has organized a Limbo Contest.

LARRY is dancing up a storm.

EXT. UNIMART - PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

Less cars. Fewer shoppers. Heading into the night shift.

INT. UNIMART - ELECTRONICS - LATER

Larry is the only Team Leader still on duty and sober. He is

fastidious in his work.

The P.A. System blares. It's incomprehensible. He pays no

attention. VASQUEZ -- a HUGE Security Guard -- comes by.

The P.A. blares again. Now they can hear it -- sort of.

Larry brightens. That is what it must be.

Flushed at the prospect, Larry gives Terrorist Fist Bumps.

He flashes his fingers: twenty two!

INT. MEETING ROOM #2 - SAME

Larry Cr wne soars into the room. Cubby is cleaning up the

substantial mess. The Front Office Team has taken seats.

Hurley has a frozen face. Larry looks at Andrews' smile.

The Janitor literally drops everything and leaves

Larry is joking.

Larry now gets it.

Strang snorts.

Hurley takes over, as blank as a tax-form.

Larry Crowne has no idea what that means.

It's true.

Larry can't believe this. Nor can he move.

She has a folder with posted "Sign Here's."

Strang finds one last piece of party pizza.

EXT. UNIMART PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

Vasquez helps Larry put down the ragged top of his car.

Larry unharnesses himself from that which is not his. Hands

it over. Branded. Scorned as the one let go...

EXT. INTERSECTION - LATER

Larry pulls up at a red light. From his hands-free speaker

jerry-rigged on his dash, we hear ON-HOLD Music.

Then, we hear the engines of SCOOTERS -- at least a dozen of

them. They surround his car -- both lanes -- and the chatter

of the riders as they scream over their engines as they AD-

"Remember, you always have a friend

LIB where they are going next...

Larry has to shout over the SCOOTER SQUAD ruckus.

The SCOOTER SQUAD has made their decision and peel out --

VROOM, YEOOW...

ZZZZZMMMM, BLAARREE... The scooters are gone, but Larry is

still yelling...

INT. RIVERBANK BRANCH - LATE AFTERNOON

Larry sits at Gammelgaard's desk looking at his own records,

She gets a brochure: "The RiverBank Survival Plan!"

EXT. DERBY COURT - EVENING

This is Larry Crowne's street.

This is Larry Crowne's house.

His car parks in the driveway and he steps out, taking a

minute to survey what he may lose.

KIDS play down the street under a streetlight... An ELDERLY

NEIGHBOR is watering his lawn with a hose... A GUY is playing

with his DOG... One house always has Christmas lights.

Another has a handicapped ramp up to the front door....

EXT. LAMARR'S HOUSE - KITCHEN WINDOW - SAME

LIVING ROOM - LATER

Mood music plays from the Crowne Vinyl Library, a complete

wall of LP's. Alphabetized... We can see into the...

Larry sits in his breakfast nook with an old laptop computer

and a pot of coffee.

An on-line job application... Mega-Save. Larry is entering

his data. He comes across that part of any application that

will forever be daunting to him.

What can he do, but enter the truth?

NONE.

More On-line Applications flash by....

White Front House and Home ... Education/ College -- High

School! Go, Navy!

Furniture Planet ... Education/ College -- Is it necessary?

Patterson's Appliances ... Education/ College -- Masters

Degree: School of HARD KNOCKS!!!

Larry stops. This may be futile. He looks about to give up.

But then, he thinks.

He stands. Thinks some more...

Unfolds like a piece of high tech assault equipment. The

iron breathes hot fumes... spray starch plumes like jet

exhaust.

Larry Crowne is ironing his nicest shirt and his best khakis

to perfection.

He is focused. Intense. And good at ironing...

EXT. MEGA-SAVE - MORNING

Resurrection Letters scream "LOST OUR LEASE! EVERYTHING MUST

GO!!!"

INT. FURNITURE PLANET - LATER

Way back in the rear of the store, behind a false panelling a

furniture store should be ashamed of, Larry has filled out

another application and is waiting for someone to give it to.

A PLANET STAFFER finally shows her head.

Larry finds a box.

Larry is alone again - ignored as he applies for this job.

Got fired yesterday.

Lamarr sits on a for-sale chair.

They cross the street to Lamarr's house/yard sale.

EXT. LAMARR'S GARAGE - SAME

This is a semi-professional operation. Boats, lamps, tools,

chairs, computers -- some of it almost junk -- is for barter

or sale.

Inside his garage? Clothes and books - racks and shelves.

Patience is organizing boxes of vinyl LP's.

He finds a East City Community College Catalog 2006. Tosses

it to Larry.

INT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - NIGHT

He is alone. He is going to lose his house. He has nothing

SportsCenter is showing highlights...

INT. LARRY'S HOUSE - MORNING

He's asleep on the couch. He awakens to the very same

edition of ESPN's SportsCenter showing the very same

highlights.

Larry wants to shoot himself in the head. Instead, he picks

up the catalog of East City College....

EXT. EAST CITY COMMUNITY COLLEGE - MORNING

The sign reads "Enroll Now! $15 per unit!"

Larry parks in one of the hundreds of empty spaces.

He grabs a folder...

EXT. E.C.C.C. TEACHERS' PARKING LOT - MORNING

PROF. MERCEDES TAINOT is a fierce defender of literacy and

intelligence -- and definitely one attractive package.

headache/grogginess combo of Biblical proportions.

Stepping from her sub-compact, she struggles into a pair of

heels, as in this state she drives barefoot. If only her

huge Thermo-cup held a hair of the dog she might not walk

such a crooked mile from the parking lot to the campus.

Larry -- in his car -- screeches around a corner. He is

frantically looking for a place to park, but as this is the

first day of term, the lot is jammed!

He nearly hits Mercedes Tainot.

EXT. E.C.C.C. - PORTABLE CLASSROOMS

STUDENTS search for their new classrooms. Mercedes does too,

years.

INT. PORTABLE CLASSROOM - SPEECH 217 - LATER

Mercedes stops at the doorway.

P.O.V.

NINE STUDENTS sit self-consciously, including PINEDO,

DIBIASI, MACK, and CALIMERIS

Mercedes quickly does a head count.

She laughs.

Mercedes explains.

Larry Crowne bursts through the door - panting for breath.

Mercedes drops her bag on her desk. She is crushed and hates

Larry Crowne.

She takes up some chalk, turns to the board, then writes in

large, shaky-yet-feminine script:

CARE.

She underlines it four times.

Pinedo has panic in her eyes. Public speaking terr fies her.

Dibiasi raises his hand.

Ms. Tainot glares at Dibiasi. Glares and glares at him.

Dibiasi's cell phone rings.

Mercedes Tainot may kill this kid.

EXT. E.C.C.C. CAMPUS - SAME

INT. ECON. 1 - LATER

An actual classroom, but in sad shape. In one section sits

LALA PINEDO - from the Speech Class.

Larry sees her and sits next to her, oblivious to the fact

that she is cripplingly shy.

We may have noticed TALIA FRANCESCO - a very stylish young

student - come in and sit nearby. No notebook or anything...

The teacher comes in - DR. MATSUTANI.

into the Promised Land!

Larry leans over to Lala.

INT. E.C.C.C. - PORTABLE CLASSROOM - LATER

Much like the other. Four students sit, waiting for class to

Mercedes has already written up on the board in Happy Letters

"English 40: Shakespeare As Politician. CARE! PLEASE! I

DO!!!"

But no one else is showing up.

EXT GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

Larry is filling up his car, watching his money go down his

gas pipe.

A body builder on a SCOOTER -- a guy we will come to know as

DELL GORDO -- pulls in to the opposite pump. He flips up the

seat, pops the pump into his scooter tank, and in seconds, is

done.

That scooter only sips gasoline. Off Dell goes, while

Larry's tank fills and fills and fills...

EXT. DERBY COURT - LATER

Larry is walking from his house over to Lamarr's.

EXT. LAMARR'S HOUSE - GARAGE - SAME

Lamarr, pipe in mouth, is forever arranging his goods.

Lamarr stops in his tracks.

INT. LAMARR'S RUMPUS ROOM - SAME

Patience is at her home office - card table. Coupons.

Computer on eBay.

Lamarr goes through the patio doors to the back yard, a space

filled with even more yard sale items.

Larry watches Vanna White turn letters - he solves the

puzzle.

She's pulled up some LP's on eBay on the computer.

From the back patio, Lamarr comes in pushing a scooter in not

too bad of shape, though its windscreen is faded.

EXT. DERBY COURT - LATER

Larry is carrying his Flat Screen TV, wires, box and all,

from his house to Lamarr's garage.

"Wing Ding Ding!" goes the scooter Lamarr has been working on

with his tools. He lets it idle as he takes the TV.

Larry straps on the old, beat up crash helmet (DOT approved).

Larry revs it, crashes into a hedge.

Images of an EROTIC SUPER-HEROINE -- busty and hot -- and

others, are being studied, and saved one after another.

EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - DEN - EVENING

DEAN TAINOT is a self-published author and blogger -- with a

taste for this kind of stuff. Multiple copies of his own

books line the shelves.

When he hears the FRONT DOOR open -- he panics.

He keeps clicking away with the mouse until he's safe.

Mercedes calls from the other room.

He covers his digital tracks and hops out of his desk.

Mercedes is prepping the Margaritas for cocktail hour.

As the blender BLARES, husband and wife eye each other. She's

looking at him. He's smiling like a guilty idiot.

Blender off. She starts pouring.

She takes a nice pull on that icy drink.

Oh fine. Thought Police. I saw

some erotica. I'm a man, I admit

it.

Took you a while.

She bangs her head.

She walks away.

EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - PATIO - SAME

It's a tiny slab, but there is a tree and a fence and a

Mercy closes the sliding door behind her and settles into her

chair and into her drink. This is where she goes when she

thinks/drinks.

Rap-rap-rap on the glass door. It's Dean, making one last

point.

Mercy turns her face to the sky...

EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

The streets are not yet crowded with traffic.

A MOTORCYCLE RIDER pilots a STATE OF THE ART STREET MACHINE:

machine helmet, leather pants and jacket, radio in the

helmet, saddlebags, windscreen. Probably a gynecologist.

INT. INTERSECTION - SAME

The cyclist pulls up right next to:

Larry Crowne, riding a scooter for the first time. Gives the

passing Rider - who couldn't care less -- a 'thumbs up!'

The light changes.

As the Rider takes off, Larry tries to do the same, but he

stalls the engine. Cars honk horns at him.

EXT. E.C.C.C. SCOOTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

Larry is trying to work the kick stand of his scooter. He is

not yet practiced at the thing. Another scooter rrives.

Talia is shaking her hair free from her helmet. Larry fails

to recognize her from Econ prime.

Larry sees Mercedes Tainot walking from the Faculty lot, and

doesn't want to be late again.

Talia watches him go. Likes him thus far...

INT. SPEECH 217 - LATER

Mercedes is at a desk in the back. Bored and, yes, a bit

hungover again. You can tell by the way she takes long pulls

from her Thermo-cup.

Busik is sitting in on the class, not far from Mercedes.

In front of the board that says "PHONES OFF!!" Calimeris is

demonstrating an exercise for her speech.

The class is too shy to applaud though Busik claps like a

fan.

No one volunteers. Though Pinedo is about to...

Larry goes to the podium - armed with a huge stack of 3x5's.

Busik shoots him a 'thumbs up.'

He looks at Mercedes for the starting cue.

Larry has used up one card. Mercedes rolls her eyes and talks

to herself in a MOVIE DEVICE way...

Larry checks on Ms. Tainot in the back. She is not talking,

only listening (the MOVIE DEVICE mentioned above)...

Busik looks at Mercedes, signals a 'not bad, eh?' about

Larry.

She is a stone face.

Larry still has a dozen cards to go.

Larry gathers his cards. Busik gives him a 'bravo!'

Pinedo tries to volunteer to go next...

Mercedes rolls her head. Busik laughs out loud.

INT. ECON. 1 CLASSROOM - LATER

An incomprehensible POWERPOINT GRAPHIC is projected with Dr.

M. explaining what it means. Gibberish!!

Larry is taking notes, beside Lala, when his phone vibrates.

He flinches to turn it off before getting into trouble.

On his phone a message: TALIA: "Scoot?"

It takes a moment for him to understand what is going on.

His phone buzzes again.

to your right"

Larry looks as instructed. He sees Talia, phone in hand,

miming riding a scooter -- you and me -- wind in our hair...

Larry gets it. Nods okay. Turning back, he finds Dr.

Matsutani, standing over him. Palm out.

Larry hands it over.

EXT. EAST CITY COMMUNITY COLLEGE - SCOOTER PARKING LOT -

Some of the Scooter Gang have assembled as Larry and Talia

walk up. DELL GORDO and STAN are talking about today's route.

Dell Gordo plants a kiss right on Talia's lips. She kisses

him back. Larry sinks a little.

It only figures Talia would have a boyfriend like Dell Gordo.

There is a beat of a stare down between Dell Gordo and Larry,

but then Dell starts to snap his fingers --

SNAP...SNAP...SNAP... -- the other join in until they are all

snapping fingers like the Jets vs. Sharks. Talia too.

Larry, clumsily, starts snapping too. After a few bars...

And just like that, everyone goes back to their wheels.

He means Larry's scooter.

Someone yells "Saddle up!"

Larry's heart breaks a tiny bit, suffering as he does from

Talia-on-the-heart.

The squad pulls out through the cars of the parking lot with

Larry trying to speed his machine along with the crowd...

They roll through town - a multi-wheeled dance troupe.

Swaying... turning... slow-motion sometimes... elegant

always.

They make riding look fun... being in a group a gas...

rolling with the wind in your hair something you'd like to

do...

As Larry and the Squad pass it by, Larry can't help but eye

the place he once worked. He sees staffers collecting carts

in the parking lot.

He misses that place...

After many shots, riders begin to peel off -- scooting done.

Talia waves at Larry who guns his throttle and pulls even

with her. TALIA (CONT'D)

EXT. DERBY COURT - LATER

The Scooters pull around the corner. Lamarr shouts.

One by one, the Scooters park and survey the scene. The

stuff that Larry was selling is now part of Lamarr's

operation, being sold 'On Consignment'. .

Dell Gordo, Stan and the others are going through hardware,

tools, appliances.

INT. GARAGE -- SAME

Talia and Patience are putting outfits together from off the

hangers.

EXT. LAMARR HOUSE - SAME

Larry stands alone, nothing to do as the Scooters poke about

INT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - LATER

He is entering some of his choice, rare LP's up for auction

on eBay.

INT. LARRY'S HOUSE - SAME

It's Talia.

Talia enters and looks around. The decor screams out: "A man

lives here."

She examines the record collection.

She closes her eyes and picks out an LP at random.

As he puts it on, Talia drifts into the...

Nothing matches, but it is well-equipped with a cozy

breakfast nook.

Larry can't believe his neighbors are so loose-tongued.

VEGETABLES ARE CHOPPED

BURNERS TURNED ON

MISMATCHED UTENSILS COME OUT OF DRAWERS

A CHICKEN BREAST IS POUNDED

OLIVE OIL GOES INTO A PAN

Pizza bread. Chopped veggie salad. Lightly fried potatoes. A

pounded chicken breast. Beer in a bottle.

Talia eats as Larry gets corn bread he steamed fresh and

moist onto a plate.

Dell Gordo has walked into Larry's house.

Dell Gordo dives in after helping himself to a bottle of beer

from the refrigerator.

Talia does a mime of Larry cooking - like a spastic drummer.

Larry goes to the window.

P.O.V.

Stan has broken down much of Larry's bike using Lamarr's

tools. Lamarr is standing over him, pointing out what he

thinks needs to be done. Stan is ignoring him.

Larry does, just for fun.

Talia throws her arms around him and kisses him on the lips --

no romance at all, but still...

She leaves. Dell Gordo lingers.

EXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - MORNING

NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS are in school uniforms, heading to the bus

stop. Dressed for school as well, Larry kick starts his

scooter, now a humming bit of mechanical perfection.

He peels out, on his way to school.

EXT. LAMARR'S HOUSE - KITCHEN WINDOW

Lamarr, and his percolator, give Larry a wave.

It's all nonsense, but it looks nice in PowerPoint form.

Larry is taking notes.

Calimeris has drawn her Pyramid of ideas.

Mack sleeps with his head straight up.

Pinedo is listening intently, counting the ideas out on her

hands.

Dibiasi is doodling drawings of football players.

Mercedes Tainot is in the back -- her mind far from her

classroom. She is preoccupied.

The applause for the speaker jolts her.

The class breaks up. Pinedo makes it a point to pick up some

DynaSem brochures. Larry remains, scribbling notes.

Mercedes signals Frances: "Not yet", then points to Larry,

still finishing up his notes.

The women watch him go. As soon as he's out the door:

Mercy wants to take it back.

She pretends to laugh. A little too much.

INT. ECON. 1 - LATER

Dr. Matsutani is diagramming on the board.

Talia is amused while sizing him up, from shoe to collar.

Bad shirt... pleated pants, too short... running shoes.

Talia makes a decision and palms her phone, punching in a

text. In a second, Larry's phone vibrates. He struggles to

get it before he gets caught with his mobile on.

TALIA: "Scoot? You/me?"

Larry nods at Talia.

Turning back, Dr. Matsutani is there again.

Larry hands him his mobile phone again.

Out she ome with an assortment of men's clothes.

With checkbooks, statements, etc. Larry is looking for the

bottom line.

Out it comes: In RED!

($887.00)

Silence on the other end.

He goes back to the computer, to eBay to see how his LP

He whispers and gestures to Carlos and Nick, who suddenly

They now bolt the kitchen, out the back way.

Perry is po ring coffee for the Agents, making small talk

as...

Out side the window, Carlos and Nick are fleeing for their

Illegal Alien lives...

INT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - MORNING

Not so much as cracking a smile, though...

INT. SPEECH 217- DAY

Mack is at the podium giving a presentation with his Star

Wars Action figures.

Mercedes TALKS to us and HERSELF.

EXT. E.C.C.C. - LATER

INT. ECON 1 - LATER

Dr. Matsutani is in mid-lecture when Larry comes in, late.

Larry moves to take a seat.

Talia can't believe his choice of dress. She mimes to him

"What's with the outfit?" His mime answer is unintelligible.

He waits. And waits. And waits. Matsutani stares fear into

the hearts of all but Larry.

Lala Pinedo clears her voice. But still whispers...

No one understood that...

Lala Pinedo beams! Larry applauds. Talia whoops!

EXT. E.C.C.C. - LATER

THUNDER ROLLS IN THE DISTANCE

EXT. SQUARE HOLE NO. 114 - MORNING

RAIN!

Coming down in buckets. Talia has the grate up, wrapping a

new outfit for Larry culled from her supply. Dell Gordo is

in a rain slicker.

Larry pulls up in his Karmann Ghia -- top up.

Dell Gordo is not happy to see this.

EXT. DONUT SHOP - MORNING - RAIN

It is raining. Mercedes' car is out front.

INT. MERCEDES' CAR - MORNING - RAIN

The windows are fogging up. Frances and Mercedes sip take-

out coffee and eat glazed rings of death.

Right next to them, Larry Crowne pulls up in his Karmann Ghia

with the top up and Talia in the passenger seat.

Talia jumps out and runs into the donut shop.

Larry rolls down his window and yells something funny to her.

He never sees Mercedes or Frances.

Mercedes wipes fog off the window.

P.O.V.

Talia is talking to the Donut Shop Lady, selecting crullers

and old-fashioneds.

Mercedes eyes Larry in his car.

Talia comes running out, with two coffees and a bag of

donuts, hops into Larry's car and they pull out as Talia puts a

ring of sweet into his mouth.

Mercedes rolls down her window and yells.

They did not hear her.

INT SPEE H 217 - MORNING

Larry is at the podium, prepping his "Personal First"

presentation as the class comes in. He is dressed as Talia

styled him.

Mercedes enters, eyeing Larry with residual venom. He is

oblivious. She takes her listening post in the back of the

room as the class goes quiet.

Mercedes signals 'Yeah, go ahead, asshole.'

first crossing of the Equator...

She looks at Dibiasi, who has snuck iPod earbuds onto his

head, is mouthing the words and playing air guitar.

The class erupts in l ughter. Mercedes wasn't paying

attention to hear Larry's bon mot.

Polite applause. Mercedes pretends she heard every word.

Mercedes missed a lot of that. Everything, in f ct.

Mercedes is learning this for the first time as well.

More anecdotes come from the class about Larry's speech.

Mercedes heard none of them...

EXT. STREET - DAY

Talia is riding alone. She slows at a TATTOO PARLOR...

INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Larry bangs out orders.

Raul sits at the butchers block, sipping coffee, observing

his new kitchen staffer.

EXT. PERFECT SPACE - DAY

An empty store right next to the Tattoo Parlor. Talia is

looking through the window

A hand-drawn sign with an arrow says "FOR LEASE ENQUIRE NEXT

DOOR ASK FOR MAURICE."

Talia smiles. Her mobile rings its unique ringtone.

STAN: "Scoot! Webster and Palm!"

INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

Larry is slapping orders together at the same time he h s his

studies out -- trying to do two jobs at the same tim

His mobile phone vibrates.

TALIA: "Scoot?"

He punches in

"Can't. Job."

He goes back to his studies just as another order comes up.

Then his phone vibrates again.

TALIA: "Job? Sob! Coming!"

EXT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Talia and the scooter gang pull in.

INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - SAME

In they pour, sizing up the place for a hangout. Talia, Stan -

- minus Dell Gordo -- and others sit at the counter where

they can see Larry.

The others pretend to be grumpy diners: Feed us! What's a

Reuben Sandwich? Where's my Sanka!

Up comes order after order. Burgers. Hot beef sandwiches.

Turkey clubs. Greek Salads.

Raul looks up from his Spanish Language Newspaper.

Talia hops up to sit on a butcher block.

And just like that, Talia has seduced another man.

telling her the secrets of purchasing orders

s fries into the deep fryer.

Talia is with Perry at the register. She's seduced him now,

as he goes over the menu and what sells more than ever.

Perry signals to Larry then to Talia and makes a talking

gesture.

BOOTH - LATER

Larry and Talia sit. She has her notebook out -- sketches

and ideas and forms...

Talia is so excited she grabs Larry and showers his forehead

with kisses.

Appearing out of nowhere: Dell Gordo.

EXT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY - PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING

Dean is opening the car door for Mercedes, putting on the

class act for a night out.

He laughs at a feeble joke we can't hear. The guy is trying.

LATER - NIGHT

They come right out the same door. They've argued and drank

all through the meal. Dean carries extra cheesecake home in

a dessert box. And, oh, they've been drinking.

INT. CAR SHOT - MERCEDES' SEVEN-YEAR OLD CAR - NIGHT

Yeow. A line has been crossed. A big, ugly line has just

been crossed. Even Dean knows it.

EXT. INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

A young couple -- call them JANET and TONY - have been on

their first date. It's gone well.

Dean and Mercy pull up beside them in their car.

Mercedes is out of the car before it even stops.

WIN!

Dean screeches off into the night. Mercedes picks up a rock

and hurls it at him.

Janet and Tony are aghast - silent - in shock.

She stomps off into the night. Janet and Tony don't know

what to do with each other now.

EXT. BUSINESS STREET - LATER

Mercedes is walking home. It's a bit longer than she would

like. She comes to a bus stop and studies the route. She

sits and removes her shoes.

She sits at he stop, about to cry. Then she sort of does

cry, for so any reasons.

In the distance, we hear...

The ROAR of SCOOTERS. Then here they come. A night-time

'Scoot'.

All the REGULARS go by. Somewhere in the mix are Larry and

Talia.

Talia is just able to turn her head and see Ms. Tainot at the

bus stop. She slows.

Larry is beside her. They stop.

She u-turns and Larry follows her, confused.

Mercedes wonders who these Mock Wild Ones are that pull up to

her.

He takes off his helmet.

Away Talia scoots to catch up with the gang.

Mercedes starts walking.

Larry shuts off his scooter, pushing it along with his feet

Mercedes ponders her shoes. He's got her. She stops.

Larry kick starts the scooter and off they go -- slowly.

EXT. INTERSECTION - MINUTES LATER.

Here they come at the speed of a lazy cow. Mercedes is

singing "Sixteen Miles on the Erie Canal".

EXT. STREET - RIDING SHOT - LATER - ON THE SCOOTER

Larry shouts over his shoulder.

I am joking.

Up ahead, flashing lights.

A COP CAR with its cherry top flashing, has pulled over a

Drunk Driver.

It's Dean. They're making him touch his nose, breathe into a

test kit.

Mercedes starts laughing.

As they pass the crime scene, Dean is being put into the back

of the Prowler, cuffed...

Mercedes' laugh fills the night as they putt-putt along.

Larry doesn't know what to make of that.

EXT. CEDAR HILLS TOWNHOMES - NIGHT

In through the gates come our night crawlers. Mercedes is

EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - SAME

Larry shuts off the motor. Mercedes is half asleep. She

doesn't remember to take off Larry's helmet.

Like a sleepwalker. Stands at the Alarm Pad.

Larry takes her hand and guides it to the pad.

Larry heard every word.

Larry digs out an Altoids tin. Rattles it.

Larry opens the door, reaches in, turns on the light.

Larry steps away from the door.

Larry has been tying to be polite.

She doesn't move, but flashes her ring finger.

She sticks her neck out. If this were a movie, they might

kiss right now.

Larry pauses. Mercedes looks at him. He's not a bad looking

guy. He starts to undo the helmet strap.

He gently removes the strap and helmet from her head.

be a bit sexy. Her hair tumbles out.

Larry has no idea what to say.

Come on, Gramps. Take this ride.

Larry ponders this moment for as long as he can. He

shouldn't, of course. But, damn. She is Mercedes Tainot.

Bang.

It's a pretty good whammy kiss. Makes her splay her arms and

everything.

Larry pulls back. After a bit, though. She could have kept

at it, too.

Larry hears the sound of the bolt. He walks away.

INT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - SAME

Mercedes leans against the door. What did she just do????

EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - SAME

Larry wistfully starts his bike, looking back at the door.

He will not forget that kiss or this night. He drives off.

EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

A TAXI is pulling up. Out of the back, Dean, looking like he

He pays the cabbie, pissed off about everything. Then his

world gets much more complicated.

P.O.V.

All his possessions, stacked up in front of the door. On the

top of the heap, his computer. Turned on and showing porn

EXT. E.C.C.C. TEACHERS' PARKING LOT - MORNING

Mercy feels terrible, stepping from her car, brutally

hungover.

As she straightens up, her eye catches...

On his scooter. Heading towards the Scooter parking.

She smiles -- a rare thing on a morning like this but the

memory of last night warrants it. She heads in that

direction.

EXT. E.C.C.C. CAMPUS - SAME

Mercy is trying to 'accidentally' run into Larry, but is

caught by surprise when..

He is walking right towards her. Oops. That would be

uncomfortable. She DUCKS behind a pillar.

Still wanting to 'bump' into the man who kissed her last

night, she circumvents his path, stalking Larry like a

birdwatcher tracks a blue-tailed swallow.

Hopping behind a tree, Mercy's SHOE gets caught in some mud.

Bending down, a branch catches her sweater and RIPS a seam.

Stepping onto the pavement, the tree branch SMACKS her in the

head.

Still, she keeps and eye on Larry. And pursues...

Staying out of his eye line, Mercy navigates her way around

to the other side of the Bench Area and preps her appearance

before making a 180 degree reverse, guaranteeing a 'Meet'

with Larry.

Then she sees her.

Sitting with others, greeting Larry with laughter and hugs

and hoots. Talia is announcing to all how she left Larry

with a drunken teacher last night, with her arm around his

waist and affection in her eyes.

Is crushed. For the obvious reasons sh s ill can't

understand. She was hoping to have Larry to herself for a

minute or two.

TALIA AND LARRY

Amid the others...

Talia slugs him. All in play...

Convinced Larry is gossiping about last night, Mercy backs

away from the scene, and slinks away toward her class.

INT. SPEECH 217 - DAY

Mercedes is in the back, wearing the darkest glasses allowed

a teacher in a classroom, hiding the fact that Mercy is

looking at Larry.

Larry is listening to Lala with delight.

The SPEECH is over. The class erupts in applause for Lala,

who has hit a home-run. Foremost of the fans, Larry, who

rises in applause for the once quiet classmate.

Then the applause is over.

The students look at each other, shrug their shoulders, and

head ou .

We hear them cackling like geese in the hall.

He means the hangover.

Larry has no idea what that means.

happened before.

Larry has just had his feelings hurt by his teacher.

Larry leaves - a good mood ruined...

Mercy watches him go. What is going on behind those dark

glasses?

EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - AFTERNOON

Larry and Lamarr are sitting on the curb, watching kids play

down the street. They run back and forth in front of them

with a soccer ball.

They both have pipes, with Lamarr showing him how to light

up.

Put a new top on it.

Shoppers pull up to Lamarr's Yard Sale. The WIFE has a

A ball flies in and hits Larry smack in the head, sending his

pipe flying.

EXT. UNIMART - PARKING LOT - DAY

Hardly any cars. Shopping carts are herded into their corral

by... former Team Leader Larry Crowne.

INT. UNIMART MAIN ENTRANCE - SAME

Larry stands where he was once king.

P.O.V.

The place looks different. Shabby. Unkempt. Understaffed.

He recognizes no one.

No one is there to help Larry pick out two 'For Sale by

Owner' signs. And, he can't help it: he straightens out

some messed up racks and shelves.

Vasquez - Security - is gone, replaced by Cubby -- the former

Janitor who is now the skinniest SECURITY GUARD in history.

Larry slides the signs for purchase. Manning the thing?

Vicky Hurley. Not looking good

Hurley looks at him. She looks tired. And stupid in her

Cashier's Apron.

Hurley is robotic.

EXT. A PARK - DAY

Trees. A picnic table. And Mercedes Tainot writing

individual words on pages of a steno book.

After each word, she folds each page many times and puts it

in a basket.

Up walks Dean Tainot, who looks neither happy nor cheerful.

Dean is caught short.

He pulls out his Blackberry and makes a note to himself.

Mercedes looks at him. She has been a fool...

EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - PATIO

Mercy -- Margarita pitcher handy -- is still writing words on

paper, and drinking. Alone. Not good.

EXT. E.C.C.C. PARKING LOT - MORNING

The sign reads "FINALS WEEK: ENROLL FOR SPRING QUARTER."

INT. SPEECH 217 - MORNING

She is in the front of the class with a small box. Hungover?

A bit, yes...

Ms. Pinedo pulls a paper from the box.

Dibiasi draws a paper.

Now it's Larry's turn. He shyly draws a paper -- a bit

uncomfortable in class since the recent events.

Calimeris picks. Hers is loopy, too.

INT. ECON 1 -- LATER

Dr. Matsutani is going on. Larry is looking for Talia, who

is not in class.

He laughs demonically.

Larry can't believe Talia is not there...

EXT. TALIA'S NEW STORE - LATER

Larry scoots up. She is inside arranging a "Coming Soon!"

window display. Dell Gordo, Stan, and the Squad are all

inside building shelves and racks.

She comes out of the store.

She shows it to him, just above her butt-crack. It's two

Japanese characters.

Dell Gordo knocks on the window as Larry has his hands on his

gal's butt... "What's this, Lance??"

It does, actually say Soy Sauce. He is starting his scooter.

Larry comes into frame, with a hammer and stake.

EXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - DAY

He is pounding the FOR SALE sign into his front lawn.

Laurie Gammelgaard pulls up her new VW Bug with a COUPLE in

the back seat. They get out and Larry nods as he waves them

to the door.

He remains on the lawn, looking at his neighborhood -- the

kids, the dogs -- Lamarr across the street.

It's all over...

EXT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

Frances and Mercedes have pulled up in her car.

They pass a car prominently parked - Larry's Convertible

Karmann Ghia with a sign on its windshield: "FOR SALE BY

OWNER."

INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - SAME

They sit in a back booth where she would never see Larry.

At that moment, Larry Crowne happens to come out of the

kitchen to help himself to a cup of coffee.

Mercedes sees him just as Perry comes up with menus.

Mercedes is surprised to see Larry in a chef's hat.

Perry leaves to put in the order.

Perry slides over a plate of French Toast -- with one bite

out of it. Larry looks up from his Econ. 1 Textbook.

Larry heads out of the kitchen.

Here comes Larry, not yet seeing Mercedes.

Knock Larry over with a feather.

During the following, Frances is trying to get a whiff of

Larry -- to find out how he smells.

The is a beat of silence.

Mercedes watches him go.

KITCHEN FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

Larry comes back through the door, humiliation wracking his

face. He tosses the French Toast down the disposal.

INT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - LATER

Mercedes and Frances are ATTACKING the house with vacuums,

cleaners, and fortitude.

BOOKS on Shakespeare and Shaw go on shelves where Dean's

tomes used to rest. Computer wires are not even untangled,

just chucked.

The cupboard is open. Where there was once booze go coffees

and teas.

MUSIC is playing as these girlfriends reconstruct Mercy's

life...

EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT

The street is empty. Larry is on his scooter, riding around

and around and around the block that he will soon leave.

He can see his NEIGHBORS through the open windows -- KIDS

bouncing on a couch...A QUARTET OF OLD FOLKS playing cards

and laughing... a MOVIE playing on a big TV.

This was Larry's street...

EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

Mercedes exits the door, crisp, clean -- like we've never

seen her in the mornings. See the way she holds, not

clutches, her Thermo-Cup?

EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - MORNING

He's wearing a zipped up jacket. Kids and dog-walkers pass

as his scooter starts pronto, he is off...

The FOR SALE sign on his lawn has an addition: IN ESCROW

INT. SPEECH 217 - LATER

On the projected computer screen: A portrait of DISRAELI.

Dibiasi is giving his speech, but we are hearing Mercedes...

Larry is listening to Dibiasi, wearing what was once his

UniMart polo, with his nametag and everything. Compared to

the man he is now, that polo looks out of place..

The class has stopped. It seems that Mercedes just said that

last bit out loud and everyone heard it. The women eye each

other. The men stifle laughs.

Larry nods.

Dibiasi is done. Applause.

They all say Lala! It's unanimous! They start chanting her

name. "La la! La la! La la!" -- embarrassing her.

Larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to

pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding.

It's a spontaneous party that Mercedes has to back out of.

As she leaves, she looks back long enough to see Larry Crowne

leading a parade around the room.

INT. ECON. 1 - LATER

Everyone is taking the final.

Dr. Matsutani. Looking around the class. Using his hands

like a pair of binoculars.

Lala is using a thesaurus and dictionary to polish answers.

Larry is finished. He walks up to Dr. M. and hands in his

Blue Book.

Dr. Matsutani hands Larry his confiscated phone. Larry

leaves.

INT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - KITCHEN

The final utensils are going into a box. Larry is doing this

part himself.

He sits for a moment -- in the breakfast nook -- surveying

his kitchen, what was once his.

Mack comes in with a box of his LP's.

EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - LATER

His furnishings are out on the lawn. Lamarr and Patience are

looking them over. Mack and Dibiasi are putting the last of

his things into Mack's huge SUV and Larry's car.

The BIG STORK PIZZA GUY pulls up in a different car but the

same sign.

The Pizza guy is none other than Jack Strang.

Larry hands him the coupon and a Twenty.

Strang leaves. Larry watches him go.

INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Raul and Perry are talking when they see Mercedes Tainot

enter.

Perry looks.

Larry is arranging his station.

Larry can see her. She looks gorgeous.

BOOTH - LARRY'S HQ - LATER

Mercedes is having coffee.

She offers him a Terrorist Fist Bump. With the hand that no

longer has a wedding ring on it...

They look at each other.

They rise.

EXT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - PARKING LOT - SAME

Mercy is opening her door, starting her car.

That's a MapGenie.

He is reaching into the car, across her to tap the unit.

While he was doing that, Mercedes was smelling what she could

of Larry. She liked it. She looked at his neck, his ears.

And smelled him.

Nothing to do now but say goodbye.

They hear a pounding.

Raul is at the window inside the cafe, signaling the break is

over.

INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - SAME

Perry greets him at the door.

Larry turns to watch Mercedes drive away.

EXT. E.C.C.C. PARKING LOT - MORNING

The sign says "New Term Beginning! $20 a unit! Ask about

Financial Aid!"

Did you notice? The cost of an education just went up...

INT. PORTABLE CLASSROOM - DAY

Mercedes has just written "Care" next to "Welcome to

Shakespeare!!" up on the board. She turns. And does a quick

head count.

Only 6 students are enrolled. She's going to lose this one,

again.

Clumps up the wooden steps are heard...

Calimeris, Mack, Pinedo, and Dibiasi come tramping in. Twelve

students now.

Mercy does a Shakespearean dance of joy.

Mercedes does her best to hide her disappointment.

The four smile at each other...

EXT. E.C.C.C. CAMPUS - LATER

Mercedes is walking to another building, another class.

She may not realize it, but she is looking for Larry Crowne.

Busik is busy chatting her up. Seriously chatting her up.

She turns.

Mercedes finds herself smiling -- beaming...

Mercy looks right at Busik.

Busik pretends he knows nothing...

EXT. E.C.C.C. TEACHERS' PARKING LOT - LATER

There is a note on Mercy's car. She takes it.

"To test your MapGenie: 4225 Harbor Blvd. 2nd floor. An 'A'

student."

Her breath catches in her heart...

EXT. MERCEDES' CAR - LATER

Mercedes is driving.

EXT. TALIA'S NEW STORE - SAME

Open for business with bunting and everything. Talia is

eating take out sushi and reading the soy sauce packet. She

is tying to check out her ass-crack tattoo to see if it

really does say 'Soy Sauce'.

Mercedes has arrived. Talia sees her and comes out.

Lamarr is around. Patience, too.

We might notice that Dell Gordo and Larry now dress exactly

alike, as we've seen the same jacket once on Lance Corona.

The tattoo parlor. Larry's scooter is right in front. As she

goes.

EXT. TATTOO PARLOR - STAIRS TO UPPER FLOOR

Music is playing. A nice view is revealed as Mercy arrives on

a nice little porch. On a little table sits a potted plant.

In the potted plant is an Altoids tin.

Mercy gives it a rattle. In the tin, a brand new key.

Mercy takes the key. Slides it into the lock and slowly

opens the door.

The music gets louder. She can't see much into the tiny

flat, but she can make out...

Larry, arranging the last of his stuff.

Mercy stands at the door until he sees her.

When he does, he says nothing. But steps to her and smells

her - her neck, her hair.

That's it.

They kiss. Damn fine whammy kiss.

INT. LARRY CROWNE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN

No larger than the nook of his old house. Breakfast is being

served.

The most beautiful woman ever to wear a bathrobe has made

French Toast and is settling into the Breakfast Nook.

Larry Crowne has his hair all on one side of his head -- post-

Afternoon-Of-Amok-Loving. His arm shows a Navy tattoo that

may be old or new...

Mercy Tainot glows in and out. She slides next to him, close

to him The meal is perfect
