EXT. MIAMI - OCEAN AVE, SOUTH BEACH - DAY

Blazing sun. MUSIC everywhere. Everybody's living la vida.

LEOPOLD (V.0.)

And we're good to go.

TWO MEN come out of the BEACON HOTEL. Loud Hawaiian shirts,

walking a Chihuahua. They pause; take in the scene on Ocean.

Adjust their EARPIECES.

LEOPOLD (V.0.)

Proceed to first checkpoint and hold.

They thread their way to the corner... across the street.. .onto

the Promenade. Under fat shady palm trees, to a CLEARING --

EXT. THE ROOF OF THE BEACON HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

AGENT STEARNS has a RIFLE with a kick-ass scope. AGENT LEOPOLD

watches through binoculars; talks through a collar mike.

Okay sit tight. Company's coming.

THROUGH BINOCULARS NOW, as TWO DEADLY MEN approach like

barracudas. A THIRD GUY, BEHIND THEM, the KINGPIN they're

protecting. Then as TREETOPS BLOCK THE VIEW --

Shit. Hang on.

Leopold scans, looking for them. Searching, until he FINDS --

The Hawaiian Shirt Guys hear that. The SEE the Barracudas,

getting nearer; steal a look at the roof...

POV FROM ROOFTOP - THROUGH BINOCULARS - A FANTASTIC BLONDE

rinses off at an outdoor shower. Beads of spray skip off

her like diamonds in the sunlight.

2.

Oh, mama.

She bends, twists; water streams down every delicious curve.

She sure is taking her time...

She must be really salty...

(shakes his head)

It's not just the salt. She's got

sunscreen on. Then the sand gets on

that, and it sticks...

(then still watching)

Hell, one time I was in Hawaii? And

these three models --

Wait a minute.

(looks at him)

Hawaii.

-- Shit!

He WHIPS THE BINOCULARS back: but all that's left is the

Chihuahua. Then, walking into the spot --

Hi, I'm Dave Barry. Has something

like this ever happened to you?

(bends down to pet

Because if you're a guy - or if you

know someone who is - then what you've

just seen should look pretty familiar.

He picks up the Chihuahua, starts walking with it.

Scientists call this condition "Lust

Induced Brain Freeze." It affects

millions of guys, every day, in all

walks of life -- causing anything

from a mild embarrassment, to an

international incident.

He stops. Finds LEOPOLD and STEARNS and SEVERAL OTHER AGENTS

pointing GUNS at him.

3.

Hand over the dog.

Hey. I didn't even know it was a

dog.

They take it from him; rush it away. Dave turns to CAMERA.

Notice I didn't say it's a condition

that affects men every day -- only

guys. And that subtle but important

difference is one of the things this

movie is about.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A HUSBAND and his WIFE. He has suitcases by the front door.

You'll never get away with this.

I'll sue you down to your last penny.

Good luck - I transferred everything

we own into private accounts, where

you can't touch it. In fact, as of

now, you're broke.

But...why?

I've fallen in love with another

woman. A younger woman. Prettier,

with no cellulite. Actually, I think

you'd like her.

You bastard.

The IMAGE FREEZES. Dave walks into the room.

Now clearly, this woman is dealing

with a Man.

4.

Whereas Guys aren't capable of

doing anything like what you just

saw. Guys are more like this:

INT. A BAR/RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A DIFFERENT HUSBAND sits across from his WIFE. Above and

behind her is a TV with SportsCenter on.

I just want you to know, I've thought

about this a lot.

Mm.

And I've talked it over with everyone

I know.

Good.

She looks down; stirs her soda.

So there's nothing left to do now,

but leave you, forever, and only see

you from across a shiny conference

table with bloodthirsty lawyers all

around it.

(a beat; turns to her)

-- Okay.

"Okay?" That's all you have to say?

(then watching him)

Well then I guess this is it.

She pushes back from the table, starts off.

Wait a minute.

This can't be happening...

The words she's waited for. She turns, relieved.

(to the tv)

How can you dQ that? How can you

trade Lupenza?

(then to the BARTENDER)

What's the matter with these people?

Beats me. I saw this on the eight

o'clock.

He's the backbone of the whole team!

They're pikers without Lupenza!

I'll see you in court.

-- I gotta call Lenny.

He takes out his cell phone. She levels a look.

Maybe you should call your lawyer

too.

If he could hit left-handed pitching,

I would.

Lenny. Pick up -- the Yankees got

Lupenza!

The IMAGE FREEZES.

EXT. A FRONT PORCH - DAY

Two OLD PEOPLE on a glider. LENORE talks directly to CAMERA.

ALBERT'S absorbed with some device that we can't see.

Well when I met him, I didn't know

so much. About guys, or men or what

have you -- we just didn't talk about

such things then. In fact, I didn't

see him naked until quite well into

our marriage. When was it Albert?

6.

A year ago. By accident.

Anyway. I thought I was marrying a

man, but didn't know that in his

heart, he was a guy.

DAVE (O.S.)

When did you first suspect?

Not long after the wedding. But it

didn't bother me. I just didn't

know how to recognize the signs.

But we've learned to live with it.

Haven't we, Albert?

(then after a beat)

Albert.

It's twelve hundred and thirty-one

miles from this spot right here, to

Cleveland.

What does that have to do with

anything?

He holds up the device - handheld GPS.

Six hundred fifty-one from Atlanta.

Who cares how far we are from Atlanta?

You have a cousin there.

Albert. There's a person here asking

us questions. There's a film crew

here.

He looks up at the CAMERA, as if just noticing someone there.

Then holding up the GPS --

You. Where do you live.

DAVE (O.S.)

Here in Miami.

What part.

Lenore buries her head.

EXT. MIAMI BEACH - DAY

Like a lot of big cities, Miami is

known for its sizeable population of

guys. So we came here to take the

city's pulse on the subject.

INT. A SECRETARY'S OFFICE CUBICLE - DAY

A young, pretty, single SECRETARY.

Let me put it this way. Everyone I

ever dated was a male. I mean they

were all men. But only some of them

were guys. You know?

DAVE (O.S.)

I see.

(thinks about it)

-- The guys were funnier. But the

men were more responsible. You could

almost half-believe them when they

told you something sometimes.

DAVE (O.S.)

So, if you were to meet someone that

was funny and responsible...

That would be a woman.

EXT. EQUESTRIAN ESTATE - STABLES - DAY

out a mane.

8.

Well guys, they're sort of like your

older brother. And men are like

your dad.

DAVE (O.S.)

In what way?

Your older brother doesn't have to

grow up. Your dad came that way.

EXT. BARN - DAY

Dave walks out of the barn towards CAMERA.

So now you have some background on

basic guy attributes. But before we

move on, let's look at one more scene

and see where you stand --

TITLE CARD: "ROGER AND ELAINE"

INT. ELAINE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

ELAINE works at a window desk. ROGER watches NFL on FOX.

-- now that's the kind of middle

linebacker you like to see. He's

got the mud all over him, he's got

the bleeding knuckles, he's got the

clumps of grass all jammed in his

Roger?

(to the tv)

Oh man you gotta show that again

Shepauses; chews her pen...

Roger...I think I really love you.

(looks over there)

But I can't bear the uncertainty

anymore, of where this relationship

is going.

Roger turns...

I'm not asking whether you want to

get married. Only whether you believe

that we have some kind of a future

together. That you, and I - have a

future.

Now this is just what you want in a

playoff game. You got snow, you got

mud, you got a lead that keeps

changing, you got two great teams

that just hate each other to the

bone and would rather die than give

up...

Roger looks...then takes the REMOTE and TURNS OFF THE TV -

waving Elaine over, who cuddles into him.

I've been thinking too, Elaine. And

for the first time in my life, I'm

feeling like I might really be close

to a lasting commitment. I haven't

said anything up until now because

it's always been important to me

that I not mislead you. But yes,

Elaine. I want to think that we dQ

have a future. And with a little

more time, I think I could be sure.

Oh, Roger...

He smiles. Strokes her hair and pulls her in even closer.

They share a long deep sigh together, As the PICTURE FREEZES

and DAVE WALKS IN.

If this was how you responded, you're

not a guy. You may not even exist.

(then taking the remote)

On the other hand...

10.

ROGER AND ELAINE DIGITALLY REWIND BACK TO THEIR EARLIER

POSITIONS. DAVE RESTARTS THE ACTION AS ELAINE IS SAYING --

I'm not asking whether you want to

get married. Only whether you believe

that we have some kind of a future

together. That you, and I - have a

future.

(then looking at him)

Roger?

(engrossed in game)

What.

FREEZE on her look, and --

If that was you...you're a guy.

INT. A DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

SHERYL CROW talks to the CAMERA before going onstage. The

muffled SOUNDS of the warmup band O.S.

Well there were always guys at my

shows - right from the beginning. I

mean you start out playing beer halls,

right? So when you have beer, you

have guys. And it sorta just grew

from there. But I was okay with it.

They didn't cause much trouble.

DAVE (O.S.)

And what about men.

Men cause trouble.

But that's okay too. I get half my

songs from that.

DAVE (O.S.)

So it all works out.

11.

Long as they buy the records...

INT. MIAMI PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

Dave walks along the stacks in the ANTHROPOLOGY SECTION.

So where did this all start? Many

experts now think they know where

men came from, but what about Guys?

where did they come from?

He stops, peels off a THICK BOOK full of science things.

To answer this question accurately,

we might have to look something up.

So instead we'll travel back to

prehistoric sub-Saharan Africa, and

get there just in time for the Dawn

of Guys.

TITLE CARD: "THE DAWN OF GUYS"

EXT. PREHISTORIC AFRICA - MOONLIGHT

The endless expanse. A cluster of caves. SOUND EFX of all

kinds of nasty shit out there. Skittering over rocks.

Slithering through the grasses. Bigger predators, circling...

A ROOSTER cocks his head back and CROWS out.

TNT. ONE OF THE CAVES

PRIMATE ROGER opens one eye...SEES PRIMATE ELAINE, PRIMATE

KIDS and PRIMATE IN-LAWS. Hairy grunting things, all sleeping

in a protective clump...

12.

He rolls over, back to sleep. But the ROOSTER CROWS again...

EXT. THE CAVES - MORNING

PRIMATE ROGER comes out. A sleepy nod at PRIMATE GENE and

OTHER PRIMATES, as they take up LARGE JAGGED ROCK SLABS

leaning against their caves and start off. In a few million

years they'll be leaving suburban driveways this way.

EXT. TRAIL FROM CAVE AREA - CAVES IN B.G. - MORNING

PRIMATE ROGER and PRIMATE GENE have joined PRIMATE LENNY and

PRIMATE PHIL. All carrying their slabs of jagged rocks.

Grunt grunt grunt grunt grunt!

-- and that's why wildebeests are so

mean.

Grunt grunt!0

Ha ha!

Grunt grunt grunt! 0

That's really funny!

Grunt ...0

I don't get it...

The other three look at him.

EXT. THE CAVE AREA - DAY

PRIMATE WOMEN work in stooped-over positions, trying to pound

roots and tend fires while BABY PRIMATES crawl all over them.

They HEAR the Primate Guys' laughter trailing off. They

trade looks; Something seems to pass between them...

EXT. HUNTING GROUNDS - DAY

Primates Roger, Gene, Lenny and Phil get to the grounds and

SEE PRIMATES PETE and LOUIE already there. These two don't

have the rock slabs though.

Grunt grunt?0

Whassup?

Grunt grunt grunt. 0

Nothing. We've been hunting.

Grunt grunt? 0

Where are your jagged rock slabs?

Grunt? a

Slabs?

(looks at Primate

Grunt grunt grunt? a

Who needs slabs?

Primate Pete laughs with him; then holds up a ROUND ROCK,

about the size of a grapefruit. Primate Roger and Primate

Gene trade looks with Primate Lenny and Primate Phil.

Grunting/subtitles continue.

FIRST FOUR PRIMATES

Ooooohhhh.

Ooooohhhh.

Where'd you get that?

Primate Discount Manny. He just got

them in.

Mind if I have a look?

Be my guest.

He hands it over. Primate Roger lays down his jagged rock

slab to check it out. His buddies gather round.

How do you kill an animal with that?

You throw it.

14.

You mean you don't chase the old

ones until they get tired and then

hit them with the jagged rock slabs?

(shakes his head)

You can stand in one place all day.

And when they go by, you just let

loose.

He shows a throwing motion. The first four look intrigued.

You can carry more than one - and if

you're throwing uphill, it rolls

back down if you miss. It's so much

easier with these.

-- I'm sticking with mine.

(then off their looks)

We've been using these jagged slabs

forever. And you know why? Because

they work. And anyway, killing them

is only half of it -- how are you

gonna skin a wildebeest with that?

They look at Primate Pete: Yeah, how? But he's there.

We get the women to do it.

They look among themselves. They like it. But then.

How?

-- I'm working on it.

EXT. THE CAVE AREA - SUNSET

The PRIMATE WOMEN are still, pounding roots and tending fires

and dealing with climbing PRIMATE KIDS. They HEAR SHOUTS

O.S.; gather and go to the ridge where they SEE

POV FROM RIDGE --

The PRIMATE GUYS are coming back, without their jagged slabs

and without any animals. But they are having great fun:

15.

running in primitive patterns, and throwing one of the ROCKS

back and forth and chasing whoever has it. It looks like

the beginnings of rugby, or Australian Rules Football, in

terms of all they need now is beer.

The PRIMATE WOMEN watch. And trade looks. Once more,

something seems to pass between them...

INT. PRIMATE CAVE - NIGHT

Primate Roger and Primate Elaine try to keep it down for the

Primate Kids' sake.

(grunting, subtitled)

Please don't tell me you got rid of

your jagged rock slab.

But these are great!

But you didn't kill anything.

Nobody's going with jagged slabs

anymore.

But the kids are hungry.

What about your pounded roots?

Pounded roots are a side dish. They

need balance in their diets.

(then off his look)

And another thing - suppose you do

start bringing animals home using

this -- who's going to skin and clean

them?

He looks at her-the SOUND of TOMORROW'S ROOSTER CROWING as

EXT. THE CAVE - MORNING

Primate Roger comes out of the cave, with his rock. He gives

it such a look.

16.

Then looking up at the sky he hurls it, up as high as he

can...

AND THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THE ROCK, UP, UP, IN SLOW MOTION,

PEAKING, THEN STARTING ITS DESCENT BACK TO EARTH -- ONLY NOW

IT'S NOT A ROCK BUT A WINDOWS --

INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

-- which ROGER is holding, across from ELAINE on the couch.

Five hundred dollars?

It can hold a thousand addresses.

So can my address book.

Can your address book pick up your

em-ail?

No but my computer can.

Well this can do both.

For five hundred dollars it should

give me a manicure, Roger! It should

drive me home from work at night!

HOW could you spend that kind of

money without discussing it first?

On Roger's look...the PICTURE FREEZES. Dave walks in.

There's a whole list of things a guy

is supposed to discuss first.

Unfortunately, he never knows what

they are until he's already not

discussed them.

17.

To a girl it's a pain in the butt.

But to a guy - some things just come

naturally...

EXT. THE PROW OF A SHIP - DAY

Shrouded in fog. EXPLORER ROGER scans the horizon through a

spyglass. Next to him is long-suffering EXPLORER ELAINE.

Well did you ask?

This is a shortcut.

Explorer Elaine shakes her head. Dave enters.

There's a very simple reason why

guys don't ask for directions. It's

because they know that if they do,

someone else - most likely Visigoths -

will come and steal their woman.

CAMERA PANS to the side rails, where a CLUSTER OF HUNGRY

VISIGOTHS nod, slobbering, confirming this.

I just want to get to Colonial

America.

TITLE CARD: "GUYS IN COLONIAL AMERICA"

EXT. BOSTON HARBOR - NIGHT

A bunch of GUYS dressed as Indians are throwing barrels into

the water. A COLONIAL REPORTER interviews COLONIAL ROGER.

-- and this is your way of expressing

the public outrage over the high-

handed anti-democratic actions of

the British Government in general

and King George III in specific?

(looks a little nervous)

Uh, yeah.

18.

Might I ask, sir, whose idea was

this?

Guy over there.

The one drinking coffee?

That's him. His name's Starbuck.

He said to get rid of all the tea.

I see. One more question. Aren't

those Greek fraternity letters painted

on your chest?

The Guy looks; GREEK LETTERS in greasepaint.

I didn't do that.

(then as the Reporter

Don't tell anyone.

EXT. MIAMI - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY

FOUR MIAMI GIRLS, ethnically cross-sectioned. LILA. MIA.

SIDRA. KARLA E.

Well that's pretty much how it is

right now, right? They don't grow

up. Or, they grow up, but they

don't change.

You want to know how to spot a guy,

there's your first clue: Look for an

otherwise man who did not grow up.

No they grow up all right -- but

only just enough - you know?

19.

Like they'll meet the absolute minimum

requirements of being a man, but

that's it. The rest of the time

they're fourth-graders. Walking

fourth-graders.

More like driving fourth graders.

With credit cards.

And a phone.

And give them ten minutes on their

own? Or put them in with other guys?

Now you've gone nuclear.

Please.

EXT. BURGER KING - DAY

The lot is filled with 60's and 70's cars. Dave gets out of

a CHEVY VEGA; has mutton-chop sideburns, talks to CAMERA.

In learning to understand Guys today,

it's important to remember that these

same guys, only yesterday, were just

kids.

INT. BURGER KING - DAY

A table of 8 YEAR OLD BOYS: punching, eating, climbing all

over each other. One poor luckless DAD with them.

BURGER KING DAD

Stop punching!

BURGER KING KID

We're not punching!

BURGER KING DAD

You are too punching - now stop! We

didn't come here to punch!

20.

They stop; look at him as if he's crazy. Then one of them

notices ROGER AT 8 looking O.S.

BURGER KING KID

Hey Roger's got a girlfriend.

I do not!

BURGER KING KID

Then what're you looking at!

Nothing!

And they start punching again. The Dad looks up - so weary...

Here we can see where even at an

early age, guy behavior is already

well developed along complex patterns

that social scientists have called,

"jerks." While girls at the same

age are referred to by the same social

scientists, as "human beings."

ANGLE ON A TABLE FULL OF GIRLS - INCLUDING ELAINE AT AGE 8

They are all chatting nicely, passing out napkins and ketchup

packets making sure everyone has what they need. While the

MOTHER that brought them quietly reads a novel.

See? Humans.

He walks past with his takeout order. As ELAINE at 8 notices

Roger, blushing, taking all this punishment because of her.

BURGER KING DAD

(as Dave exits)

Will you please stop punching!

INT. NOTED PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Dave sits across from a BRITISH GUY with a SUBTITLE saying,

"Noted Pediatrician. " He has a laser pointer and a

powerpoint presentation.

21.

Where are we in the area of Guy

Violence, Doctor.

Well first, one must understand the

inherent differences in DNA and cell

structure as relates to men and women.

For example, all women have a gene

that makes them have the need for

meaningful conversations. Likewise,

all men have a gene in them that we

scientists believe is directly related

to violence.

And what can be done about that.

well, some of my esteemed colleagues

are quite keen on the idea of

tampering with the DNA itself - an

idea with which I heartily disagree.

The bastards...

Then what would you recommend.

Me? Well they can start by spreading

out the funding a little bit. Let a

few other scientists wet their beaks.

I mean what's the point of rewarding

the same tired old hacks, year after

I meant about Guy Violence.

(then shifting back)

Well nothing, really. I mean, what

can you do. Short of lobotomizing

them, anyway. No I suppose we'll

just have to continue to channel

their aggression into socially

acceptable outlets. Like professional

wrestling, or the space program.

I see. Can I ask you a question?

22.

Certainly.

Where'd you get that laser pointer.

It's mine.

EXT. TOY WORLD WAREHOUSE PLANET - DAY

Dave stands in front of the entrance.

A lot of work has been done in the

field of children's toys and how

they unconsciously reinforce gender

roles. Studies have found that over

ninety-three per cent of this work

is done by researchers who don't

have children of their own. But to

test the theory anyway, we're here

at Toy World Warehouse Planet.

INT. TOY WORLD WAREHOUSE PLANET - DAY

Dave shepherds new father GENE up to the CUSTOMER HELP

counter.

Hi! My friend here is looking for

toys for his son that are gender

neutral, environmentally sound, and

culturally unbiased!

Here it is.

He brings up a box with a picture of a spinning top on it.

NEW FATHER GENE

What's it do?

It's recyclable.

23.

NEW FATHER GENE

Where are the trucks and guns.

EXT. TOY WORLD PARKING LOT - DAY

New Father Gene meets up with NEW MOTHER KELLY at the car.

She came from GROCERY WORLD; he helps load up the bags...

NEW MOTHER KELLY

What's this?

NEW FATHER GENE

(looks, sees the toy

Oh I got that for Benjy.

NEW MOTHER KELLY

You were supposed to get a rattle.

NEW FATHER GENE

All the rattles were recalled.

NEW MOTHER KELLY

So you bought a tank.

NEW FATHER GENE

Wait'll you see what this can do,

baby. Benjy's gonna love it.

NEW MOTHER KELLY

Oh yeah? Can he shake it? Will it

rattle?

NEW FATHER GENE

Rattle? This thing'll bring down a

bookshelf!

She looks at him. He'll be returning the thing within

seconds. CAMERA PANS to Dave, who shrugs.

EXT. DETROIT - ED'S AUTO SHOP - DAY

A rundown place with junked cars out front. ED's an intense

little guy in a Tigers' hat and a couple major tattoos.

Well I'm into fireworks. I like to

take 'em apart, you know. And study

'em. See what makes 'em tick.

24.

He shows Dave a box with ASSORTED FIREWORKS inside.

I just got these from Ohio. I don't

think they're as good as the ones I

got from Tennessee. Not as loud,

you know?

Well no, if loud is your --

If you want to hear loud - listen to

this.

He goes over to a different box, takes out what looks like a

stick of dynamite. Gets ready to light it; turns to CAMERA.

You may want to step back a couple

hundred yards.

INT. DAVE'S CAR - TRAVELING - DAY

As Ed's Auto Shop recedes in the background - with a LOUD

EXPLOSION accompanying -

So when we see guys like Ed, and his

fireworks - or guys shooting marine

flares into innocent pumpkins, or

building catapults that'll throw a

Buick - we should not condemn them.

We should not assume these are just

pointless juvenile activities.

Instead we should be convinced they

are, and move on to Guys in the

Workplace.

EXT. CITY STREET - PHILADELPHIA - DAY

A PHILADELPHIA GIRL stands outside a CHEESESTEAK PLACE.

Guys at work? Or guys doing work.

25.

PHILADELPHIA GIRL (CONT'D)

I mean unless you want to talk about

faxing or emailing their stupid jokes

back and forth. Sick jokes.

EXT. WALL STREET - DAY

Dave and a SEASONED BROKER eat HOT DOGS from a CORNER CART.

Ten, fifteen years ago? A guy would

call you up with some joke he just

heard. So you wanna pass it on,

it's by phone. One person at a time.

Then a while later, some guy calls

you up with the same exact joke.

Then when group faxing came in, it

really sped things up. Next thing

you know there's like ten faxes on

your machine, from places you never

even heard of. Places around the

world, I'm saying.

And how long would that take.

A run of the mill, 'guy walks into a

bar' joke, those'd take about .a. week

to come back to you. The topical

ones, your mass murders and tragic

accidents and the like, they're

naturally gonna have a lot more heat

on them and they'll circulate a lot

quicker. I mean no one's gonna sit

on a Princess Diana joke until three

weeks after the crash. No one i

know, anyway.

Now there's the internet -- and what

used to take a week'll take like

seconds. I'm telling you it's getting

harder and harder to keep up.

A lot of people don't understand the

attention and the kind of importance

these jokes have.

Who.

26.

Oh you mean women? Well, you know -

what's the importance of having

fifteen pairs of shoes?

No one knows that.

TITLE CARD: "ROGER AND ELAINE"

INT. ELAINE'S CAR - DAY

Roger is slumped across the back seat; messed-up clothes and

in obvious pain. Elaine drives; talks to CAMERA.

So I get this call at work.

(then to Roger back

You want to tell this?

Its just a sprain.

(shakes her head)

I get on the phone and they say he's

okay - but maybe I should come down

to the paper and get him. Does he

look okay?

It's a sprain. It just looks worse.

Not the way I heard it.

TNT. NEWSPAPER BUILDING - EARLIER THAT DAY

Roger's at his desk; can't help but HEAR PATRICK, TOM and

GENE talking nearby.

He's how old?

High school. A sophomore.

27.

Big deal. I could run the forty

that fast.

You and who - the Flash? This kid

set a national record.

Yeah? What nation.

TNT. ELAINE'S CAR - CONTINUING

Tell me something. If the article

was about a poem there wouldn't be

an argument - would there.

Why would there be an article about

a poem.

I'm just saying. I don't see the

four of you fighting over who can

write the better sonnet.

So?

So no one gets hurt writing sonnets.

(off her look; then)

It's a sprain.

INT. THE NEWSPAPER BUILDING - DAY

Roger listens more agitated as the argument mounts.

When did you last run the forty?

Hey. I could beat you in the forty

running backwards.

28.

You couldn't even beat your butt

running backwards.

(from his desk)

Will you guys cut it out?

They stop. Look at him.

The kid in the story's in high school.

You're not. You're supposed to be

adults and you're bragging about who

can beat who in a stupid footrace.

No one's bragging.

Gene's just saying he can run the

forty in under six seconds.

Hey. I can do it in under six

seconds.

FREEZE THE PICTURE, on their expressions. BRING UP "CHARIOTS

OF FIRE" MUSIC

EXT. CITY PARK - DAY

The FOUR GUYS crouch in their starting stance. A SECRETARY

stands at the end of a marked-off course with a stopwatch

and a whistle. She blows the whistle. They're off.

SLOW MOTION WITH MUSIC

All four guys explode off the line. Patrick gets five strides

and goes down. Tom gets two more and falls, howling in pain.

Then Gene and Roger, neck and neck for at least three more

strides until Roger HEARS A "POP," that ECHOES over the music,

and goes toppling down. As Gene finishes alone - gripping

his side in awful pain but pumping his fist in victory.

29.

MUSIC FADES AS

INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Elaine comes in; Roger, limping and leaning heavily on her.

I don't know why I listened to you.

You need to see a doctor.

It's a sprain, Elaine.

Roger you can't walk.

It'll work itself out.

She gives him a look. Parks him long enough to close the

door behind him. Without her support, he drops to the floor.

She turns to the CAMERA.

Why won't they go to the doctor?

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

British, white coat, stethoscope.

Here's why.

He holds up a RUBBER GLOVE. Dangles it harmlessly.

I don't care who they are. If they

think there's even a chance their

doctor will use one of these - and

they always assume there is - they

won't come in.

30.

(puts it away, shakes

If there's anything out there that

would bring them in... it hasn't

been invented yet.

TITLE CARD: "THE FANTASY GUY MEDICAL CLINIC"

EXT. FANTASY GUY MEDICAL CLINIC - DAY

It says so on the SIGN. ANOTHER SIGN, like an international

road sign, has a graphic of a HAND IN A RUBBER GLOVE with a

RED LINE through it. There are also SPORTS TEAM BANNERS.

INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

The DOCTOR checks a GUY'S chart. There's a TV with ESPN on

in the exam room.

What seems to be the problem?

Well the main thing is, I keep

coughing up blood. And I get these

really severe chest pains, and double

vision sometimes. And every night

at sunset, little worms come burrowing

out of my skin.

It's just a sprain.

That's what I thought.

TITLE CARD: "GUY FEELINGS"

INT. MIAMI - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY

Karla E, Mia, Lila and Sidra again, with Dave.

A lot has been said about how guys

don't share their feelings.

You mean they have them?

Or they have them and don't

acknowledge them.

Or they don't think that others have

them.

Or they just don't think.

(as they agree on

-- Is it possible that they do have

feelings, they do acknowledge them

and they do know others have them -

but they just don't express it the

same way?

Four blank faces look at him. Then.

Sports. They have feelings about

sports.

And their underwear.

You ever try and throw out their

underwear?

Once. I nearly lost my life.

They act like it's so sacred. I've

seen pairs of briefs with holes in

them larger than the leg holes.

(as the others nod)

I tried to throw a pair out once?

And sneak it past him? He went out

into the garbage and found them. He

said he couldn't trust me after that.

Tell me what that's all about.

I don't even want to think about it.

32.

(off their reactions)

So you agree then, that guys at least

have feelings.

They just waste them. That's all.

EXT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

ROGER and ELAINE get out of Roger's car. Elaine has an

armload of magazines.

Now remember. Gene's dad is real

sick. Kelly says he doesn't talk

about it. So see if you can draw

him out.

He already did talk about it.

Oh? What did he say?

He said his dad is real sick.

She gives him a look. Gets to the door.

What are those?

Kelly's boss is turning forty.

So you're giving her magazines?

(a look; then)

Just see if you can get him to talk.

INT. DEN - NIGHT

There's a GAME on. Gene sort of stares. Roger has a SHOEBOX

on his lap; goes through Gene's SEGA cartridges.

33.

Galaxians. Far out...

(while Roger keeps

Can you believe the Yankees got

Lupenza.

They get everybody.

I know. They suck.

I know.

Silence. Roger pulls out two cartridges, compares them.

I got to Level 24 of Arkanoids.

-- You're kidding.

Gene shakes his head. He's not. This is big.

You've seen the Evil Presence?

(then off his look)

What's it look like?

Gene shrugs; even the best of friends. Roger understands.

CAMERA PANS to Dave.

sharing.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Elaine and Kelly with magazines and writing pads.

Well I don't know. How do you think

she feels about getting older?

I don't know... I know how I felt.

How did you feel about it?

How does anybody feel.

So you think she'll want a smaller

gathering?

Well if we go that way, we know who

to invite.

But then who do we not invite.

Exactly. And how are they going to

feel about that.

So maybe we should make it a slightly

larger gathering.

-- Depends on the food, I guess. I

mean, if we go with a larger

gathering...

Exactly.

(finds the right

I saw something earlier in here about

low-fat hors d'oeuvres.

Oh - I've seen that one too.

They open to the article, scanning it.

Hmm.

Hmm.

35.

You thinking what I'm thinking?

That if we have low fat hors d'oeuvres

she'll think we noticed she's gaining

weight?

Exactly.

Maybe just blow it out, you know? I

mean it's a party. Go with the high

fat.

Thinking she won't think we've noticed

the weight gain.

Unless she thinks that's insensitive.

You know, that we hadn't noticed...

Hmm...

They close the magazine, look through the others when:

How about medium fat hors d'oeuvres?

And we could cut them into smaller

pieces?

She could think we were being cheap.

And how would she feel about that...

INT. THE DEN - SAME

That one has the GPS. With the screen

that has maps of everything?

36.

What about with the convertible.

It's optional on the convertible.

Unless you get the turbo, then it's

standard.

Phil Wonkerman got the turbo.

No shit...Phil got a Porsche?

Said it was his birthday present to

himself.

When was his birthday.

Beats me. Probably around the same

time when he got the car.

No shit...

Maybe we should get him something.

(looks at him)

He just got a Porsche.

Right.

They look at the TV again. Then, from the kitchen doorway:

Roger?

They turn. Elaine gives Roger a look. PICTURE FREEZES AS:

37.

Roger met Elaine at a company event.

EXT. A HOTEL POOL - DAY

PEOPLE with NAMETAGS mingle with drinks and appetizers.

Dave comes away from the hot buffet table with a great haul.

-- They discovered they had something

in common right away.

He points to ROGER and ELAINE, over by a tiki-torch.

You're kidding! That was you? At

the Burger King?

I was in fourth grade.

I was too! But my God, you remembered

that?

(off Roger's nod)

She loved that he remembered that.

INT. A BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

A GLOW-BOWL night; neon and black light and MUSIC.

(handing out shoes)

A few nights later, he asked her

out.

He points over to the LANE where they're bowling.

They had a good time, and so he asked

her again. And then before too long

they were seeing each other regularly,

and not seeing anyone else.

38.

Of course, Elaine was the only one

who knew that...

EXT. RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Roger opens Elaine's door for her, then goes around. She

lingers, watches him before she gets in.

What.

Nothing...

She smiles; gets in. Roger pauses. CAMERA PANS TO DAVE.

Roger has no idea that this was a

defining moment for her.

Roger gets in. Fuzzy but not sure why.

INT. ROGER'S CAR - NIGHT

Roger drives. Elaine looks out ahead. Long stretch of road

and no one on it. She turns; looks at him.

Do you realize that, as of tonight,

we've been seeing each other for

exactly six months?

CAMERA HOLDS on her. She waits.

ELAINE'S INNER VOICE

Gee...I wonder if it bothers him

that I said that. Maybe he thinks

I'm trying to push him into some

kind of obligation that he doesn't

want, or isn't sure of. Maybe he's

been feeling confined enough by our

relationship as it is...

CAMERA PANS TO ROGER.

ROGER'S INNER VOICE

Six months...

CAMERA PANS TO ELAINE.

ELAINE'S INNER VOICE

He's worried.

(then thinking about

Well hey - you know? I'm not so

sure I want this kind of a

relationship either. Sometimes I

wish I had a little more space, so

I'd have time to think about whether

I really want us to keep going this

way. I mean, where are we going?

Are we just going to keep seeing

each other at this level of intimacy?

Are we heading toward marriage?

Toward children? Toward a lifetime

together? Am I ready for that level

of commitment? Do I really even

know this person?

CAMERA PANS TO ROGER.

ROGER'S INNER VOICE

So that means it was...let's see...

February when we started going out,

which was right after I had the car

at the dealer's, which means ... lemme

check the odometer...

(he looks down at it)

Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil

change here.

CAMERA PANS TO ELAINE. An OVAL IMAGE OF HER APPEARS in the

top corner of the screen; they watch him together.

ELAINE'S INNER VOICE

He's upset. I can see it on his

face.

ELAINE'S OVAL IMAGE

You know, maybe you're reading this

completely wrong - and he wants more

from the relationship.

ELAINE'S INNER VOICE

More intimacy...more commitment...

-- and maybe what's happening, is

he's sensing my reservations?

ELAINE'S OVAL IMAGE

Well don't bet the farm on it. But --

ELAINE'S INNER VOICE

-- And that's why he's so reluctant

to say anything about his own feelings -

he's afraid of being rejected...

CAMERA PANS TO ROGER.

ROGER'S INNER VOICE

And I'm gonna have them look at the

transmission again. I don't care

what those morons say, it's still

not shifting right. And they better

not try to blame it on the cold

weather this time. What cold weather?

It's eighty-seven degrees out, and

this thing is shifting like a goddam

garbage truck, and I paid those

incompetent lowlife bastards six

hundred dollars.

CAMERA PANS TO ELAINE.

ELAINE'S INNER VOICE

-- He's angry. And I don't blame

him. I'd be angry too. God, I feel

so guilty, putting him through this,

but I can't help the way I feel.

I'm just not sure.

ELAINE'S OVAL IMAGE

You know what your problem is? You're

too idealistic. You're waiting for

some knight to come riding up on his

white horse, when you're sitting

next to a perfectly good person, a

person you enjoy being with, a person

you truly do care about, a person

who seems to truly care about you.

A person who is in pain because of

this self-centered, schoolgirl fantasy

that you insist on clinging to.

CAMERA PANS TO ROGER. His OVAL IMAGE APPEARS; at the LOCAL

BAR with a beer in front of him and pool tables in b.g.

ROGER'S INNER VOICE

They'll probably say it's only a

ninety day warranty. That's exactly

what they're gonna say, the scumballs.

ROGER'S OVAL IMAGE

Let 'em say what they want. You

don't have to listen.

Roger?

ROGER'S INNER VOICE

You know you're right. They want a

warranty? I'll give them a goddam

warranty. I'll take their lousy

warranty and stick it right up their --

Roger.

-- What?

Please don't torture yourself like

this. Maybe I should never have...

Oh God, I feel so...

(looks over, alarmed)

She struggles to keep control. Her OVAL IMAGE disapproves.

I'm such a fool. I mean I know

there's no knight. I really know

that. It's silly. There's no knight,

and there's no horse.

There's no horse?

He looks up; his OVAL IMAGE SHRUGS; gets up off the stool.

You think I'm a fool, don't you?

(reacting to the Oval

-- no!

He looks over at her; not sure who he responded to...but it

appears he said the right thing anyway.

42.

It's just.. .well I need ...time, I

think. I think I need some time.

Roger looks up at his OVAL IMAGE: gone. He looks at Elaine.

-- Time. Yes.

(moved, touches his

Oh Roger, do you really feel that

way?

What way?

About time. Do you feel that way

about time?

Roger looks confused. His OVAL IMAGE is off playing pool

now. He turns to Elaine; does his best to look decisive.

Oh. Well. Yes. Yes I do, feel

that way. About time.

Thank you, Roger.

-- Thank you.

They smile. Look forward. He looks a little nervous. She

looks serene...

EXT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Roger drives away. Elaine goes into her building. Already

dialing her cell phone...

43.

Come on, Kelly -- pick up.

INT. ROGER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

.while Roger and his OVAL IMAGE watch an OBSCURE FOREIGN

SOCCER GAME. Share a giganto bag of Doritos.

Hey, Ref - look alive. Those guys

were offsides.

They suck.

Who, the Albanians or the Moroccans.

ROGER'S OVAL IMAGE

They both suck.

I know.

He eats some more Doritos. But then suddenly-he pauses.

I think I missed something back there.

ROGER'S OVAL IMAGE

Wait for the replay.

(shakes his head)

No I mean in the car.

ROGER'S OVAL IMAGE

Can't help you. I was shooting pool.

Roger looks up at his Oval Image. It shrugs.

EXT. A JUICE BAR - DAY

Elaine huddles with Kelly.

.and you said 'there's no knight.'

44.

- and no horse.

Did you say 'no knight and no horse,'

or 'no horse and no knight?'

She looks at Elaine.. This is crucial.

I said 'no knight.' And then I said

'no horse.'

I know he agreed to the knight.

But maybe not the horse.

Elaine racks her brain; just can't say for sure.

It's probably not important...

(then watching her)

This is really it for you. Isn't

it.

(looks at her; nods)

Really it.

(glad for her)

Does he know it?

Elaine looks up; she has no idea.

EXT. LOCAL HOOPS COURT - DAY

Roger and Gene get ready for some 1 on 1. Roger passes to

Gene...

Check.

.who passes it right back.

Check.

45.

Roger takes the ball, dribbles, almost starts but doesn't.

Gene looks at him.

Listen.

What.

(a beat; then)

-- Elaine and I.

Elaine and you what.

(a beat; then he shrugs)

We sort of have this -- thing.

He looks at Gene. Conveys the full impact of this. Then --

Did she ever mention owning a horse?

Who.

Elaine. She ever talk about horses?

Like, to Kelly or something?

Not that I know of. Why?

Roger thinks.. .then shakes it off. Throws the ball to Gene.

What's the score.

We haven't started yet.

They start to play. CAMERA FINDS DAVE, on a nearby bench.

Roger's in love.

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

SHERYL CROW takes a break in the MIXING BOOTH.

46.

I can sympathize with your friend,

man. I've seen a lot of guys go

there.

Do you have any advice for a guy in

love?

I don't know - most of my songs are

about guys out of love.

I see.

Cause you know, a guy in love - a

guy who's where your friend's at,

anyway - they don't know where they

are. They're like an ant, standing

on a truck tire. They don't know

how they got there - all they know

is that's not where they were a minute

ago. But then they sort of get

vaguely okay with it, you know?

They start hangin' out there, they're

feelin' pretty good.

Until the thing starts moving.

What happens then.

Well then they get crushed.

Dave gulps. She shrugs.

Rock and roll, my friend. Life in

the city.

INT. TWO OLD PEOPLE ON A COUCH - DAY

November 8, 1960. The day John

Kennedy beat Nixon and won the White

House. That was the day I met her.

His WIFE turns, looks at him funny.

It was close the whole way - it was

neck and neck by God. But then old

Kennedy Senior rode on in on that

big old pile of money of his, and

fixed the results in Illinois. And

that made all the difference.

Happiest day of my life, just about.

She watches him. The man is hopeless.

I was walking away from a newspaper

stand, with my head buried in the

final edition. And I looked up, and

there she was.

(he looks over at his

You were wearing a yellow sun dress

and there was a smudge of makeup

just over your left eye.

He smiles at her. Gets a thin smile back.

What.

That wasn't me.

Of course it was you. What are you

talking about?

It was your first wife.

Nonsense.

We met in Sacramento. Eight and a

half years ago.

Don't believe her.

I've never owned a yellow sun dress

in my life. And even if I did, I

wouldn't be wearing it in November.

48.

(off her look)

-- The point is, in 1960 an Irish

Catholic could be elected president

of this fine country, as long as his

father was a filthy rich rum-runner

with connections to the Mafia! And

when Nixon did get elected, he had

to quit!

His wife shakes her head.

INT. KELLY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Kelly and Gene on the sofa.

Well we didn't know each other. I

mean, of course we didn't - we hadn't

met yet. But we were both invited

to the same party, by different people

who we only knew marginally - only

the party got cancelled, and I guess

that's how marginal we were, because

no one told us. So we came in

different cars and found ourselves

at the same front door - with no one

home.

(then taking his hand)

So Gene asked me out to eat.

I was hungry.

You were in love.

(then off his look)

You told me you loved me, that first

night!

I said I loved mashed potatoes.

You were eating mashed potatoes.

You said you loved me. You said

because your name was Gene and mine

was Kelly, that that just proved it.

We were meant to be together.

49.

(off her look; then

-- Does this have to go in the movie?

EXT. GENE AND KELLY'S PLACE - DAY

Dave walks out, talks to the CAMERA.

Contrary to what many women believe,

it's fairly easy to develop a long

term, stable, intimate and mutually

fulfilling relationship with a guy.

As long as this is the guy:

QUICK SHOT OF A LABRADOR RETRIEVER -- PANTING, FRIENDLY.

With human guys, it's extremely

difficult. This is because guys

don't really grasp what women mean

by the term 'relationship.'

EXT. JERSEY SHORE - DAY

A JERSEY GIRL on break at a SNACK HUT.

What I don't get is how they can be

a fully grown adult male and not be

able to make a commitment to a woman

who loves him like no one else - and

yet the same person, at age seven,

could make an unbreakable lifelong

commitment to the San Francisco

Giants, who do not even know him and

who never will.

(shakes her head)

I just don't get it.

EXT. SEATTLE - E-CAFE - DAY

A SEATTLE GIRL outside the cafe.

50.

They're never "ready." If you ask

me, guys are in a permanent state of

nonreadiness. That's where they

live. If guys were turkey breasts,

you could put one in a 350 degree

oven on the Fourth of July and they

still wouldn't be ready in time for

Thanksgiving.

EXT. CHICAGO - RARE BOOKS STORE - DAY

The OWNER arranges titles on a display outside her store.

The thing is, you shouldn't even

think about marrying them until you

really know them. But you can't

really know them until you marry

them.

(then after a beat)

That's the thing.

TITLE CARD: "GUY FIDELITY"

EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

A Manhattan Girl gives a world-weary look.

One: A guy will have sex with

anything. Two: A guy will do

anything to have sex. There's your

Guy Fidelity. Move on.

TITLE CARD: "GUY PRIDE"

INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S MARRIED HOUSE - DAY

Elaine and Roger are inside, looking at the front door.

What do you mean, it's 'supposed to

be that way.' It's stuck.

It's basic physics, Elaine. Wood

expands. And then, later, it

contracts.

But we can't get out.

Which also means other people can't

get in. That's part of the design -

it discourages burglars.

(looks at him)

The same way the toaster was designed

to discourage carbohydrate consumption

by bursting into flames?

That was an outdoor toaster. It was

clearly not designed for indoor

situations.

The PICTURE FREEZES. DAVE steps in front, talks to CAMERA.

I think it's obvious here, that Roger

has absolutely no idea what he's

talking about. But Guy Pride forces

him to keep acting like he does know,

for reasons I believe we've covered

in an earlier scene.

He nods his head over to the corner, where the CAMERA PANS

TO SEE HUDDLED VISIGOTHS, WAITING. Then BACK TO ROGER AND

ELAINE as the PICTURE UNFREEZES.

Okay. So now we have a broken water

heater and a stuck front door.

I think it's time to call Steve.

ELAINE'S IMAGE FREEZES. Roger turns to the CAMERA.

52.

"Steve."

EXT. CUL DE SAC - DAY - SLOW MOTION - HEAVENLY MUSIC

STEVE leaves someone's house, heads for his super-outfitted

TRUCK. Haloed in golden sunlight. Strong, capable, equipped

for every situation.

WOMEN look out from kitchen and bedroom and living room

windows, from front steps and yards and gardens, just to see

whose house Steve is leaving. The women look all dreamy the

way they would in a really corny musical.

(watching; to CAMERA)

As far as women are concerned, God

didn't really rest on the seventh

day. On the seventh day, God created

Steve.

As the Women all sigh...

INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S HOUSE - DAY

Elaine stands at the basement door. CLANGING down there.

Roger? Did you find anything?

INTERCUT WITH ROGER IN THE BASEMENT

He's in ankle deep water. Pokes a FLASHLIGHT into some of

the corners where the overhead bulb doesn't reach.

Good news, honey! The basement's

level.

How can you tell?

Because I know a well built floor

when I see one! We were right to

buy this house. Everything works

just the way it should!

53.

Except there's no hot water.

(aiming the flashlight)

Sweetheart, don't you remember? The

power company talked about this.

How about calling Steve.

We'll call "Steve," when we have a

real problem. Okay?

(then more to himself)

A mouse gets the hiccups, you don't

have to call Steve every time.

(hears him whang

something down there)

But Roger you're such a good copy

editor. You don't have to be a good

repairman too! Honest!

Okay I think I found it.

The problem?

The water heater.

Elaine leans her head against the door jam.

EXT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S HOUSE - DAY

Elaine sits on the step, looking blank. Kelly is with her.

There are LOUD NOISES from the basement.

I don't know why he does this. He

doesn't know what he's doing down

there...

It'll be all right.

54.

(off a loud CLANG)

It's not like some broken part is

just going to be standing there,

waving a flag that says "Help me."

Or there'll be an octopus on the

compressor, and then he could say,

"Look! There's an octopus on the

compressor!"

Of course, how would he know it was

the compressor...

Trust me, it'll all work out. After

a while, there's no more harm they

can do.

Roger comes around from the side door. SLOSHING feet. Holds

a dripping PART.

I just need to go to the hardware

store. Hi Kelly.

Kelly smiles, waves. Then as Roger sloshes past, to the

car.

And what is it about the hardware

store? All they do in there is buy

a bunch of tools that they don't

know how to use -- and no matter

what the problem is, all they'll end

up doing is whacking at it with a

hammer until it breaks even more.

And then they cover it all up with

duct tape and then come out and say

it's supposed to work that way.

Then we have to call Steve. And

they get offended.

INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Roger waits at the counter. Talks to CAMERA.

55.

Let me tell you something. If I had

a dollar for every time I heard

"Steve's" name, I could hire somebody

better than Steve, just to shake

things up. Get her one of these old

semi-retired guys - someone from the

pre-steroid days, with the hairy

shoulders, and the butt crack. They

won't be so quick to call him every

ten minutes.

The Clerk comes back. Hands over a 53-piece TOOL SET.

Remember. Keep these away from

anything magnetic.

Got it.

He takes the tool kit from the Clerk and drops it. The Clerk

watches Roger chase down all the parts: what a dolt.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Roger puts the tool set in his trunk...then stops.

The thing is - I missed out.

(turns to CAMERA)

It's like everyone else was there

the day they taught all this stuff.

How to look inside acar.Or a

furnace. Or a rocketship.But the

guys like Steve, youknow.They

were born knowing allthis- and now

they're laughing.

56.

They all go down to the Competent

Guys' Tavern and compare notes.

EXT. COMPETENT GUYS' TAVERN - DAY

VANS and PICKUP TRUCKS just like Steve's are parked outside.

A STEVE LOOKALIKE gets out and goes in, greeting ANOTHER

STEVE also arriving. LAUGHTER pours out from inside.

EXT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S HOUSE - DAY

Steve rings the bell. Elaine tries opening the door.

(on other side)

I'm sorry - the door's stuck.

I can fix that.

He checks it out, taps it in one place and opens the door.

Elaine steps aside, enchanted --

-- as Roger drives up and sees this. And the pain in his

heart is something we can feel.

INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S BASEMENT - DAY

Power's back on. Steve pulls the cover off the HVAC assembly.

Roger is sorting through the 53-piece tool set he bought and

has no idea what to do with.

If you've got a minute, sir. I'd

like to show you something.

(holds up tool kit)

Should I bring these?

That won't be --

(then as all the parts

-- necessary.

The latch broke.

I can fix that.

Roger puts the tool kit down. Joins Steve.

There's your problem right there.

You got calcification in your pullet-

beam header grommets.

I was afraid of that.

Steve looks at him. One of those sideways looks.

What you gotta do is jack up your

laminate bolts and remove the

calcification on the stress points.

(while Steve takes

Of course when he says "you," he

doesn't mean "me." I don't have jacks.

I don't have winches. And Steve has

got like fifty kinds of each, right

on his truck. If society collapsed,

the Steves of the world will be living

in nice sturdy shelters that they

built with their own hands, eating

food that they grew or caught. And

I'll be getting shredded to death by

wolverines.

Here we go.

He reaches down. Pulls out a fuse assembly, holds it up.

58.

Here we go. Back in business in no

time.

EXT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S HOUSE - DAY

Steve is packing up his truck. Roger is about to go back

Dad, look! Look what Steve made me!

A working battleship made entirely

out of Coke cans!

Roger looks. It is a working battleship made from Coke cans.

This is so neat! Thanks, Steve!

The kid runs off. Roger looks at Elaine.

Do we have a kid?

Steve got him from the truck.

INT. STEVE'S TRUCK - TRAVELING - DAY

Dave rides up front with Steve. Talks to CAMERA.

Just because Steve can fix things,

doesn't mean he's shallow and doesn't

have any concerns. All guys have

concerns. Deep concerns.

You like SportsTalk? Mike the Moose?

Hell yeah.

Steve gives him a look. Turns on the radio.

59.

I'm just sayin' those owners better

never run into me. Because God help

'em, man.

MIKE THE MOOSE

-- and we'll pick up on that and

more, right after the news.

I mean it, man.

INT. RADIO STATION - WGRG-AM SPORTSTALK - DAY

MIKE THE MOOSE flips a switch; turns to Dave.

MIKE THE MOOSE

Three months ago, the Marlins traded

a guy named Rufino Lupenza to the

Yankees, for some minor league players

and cash. I grant you it was a rotten

trade. I grant you the Yankees seem

to have this, this knack for making

brilliant deals year after year.

But three months?

(pops in a tape)

The Marlins are over it. The Yankees

are over it. The players and their

families are over it -- but just

check this out.

The guy was a workhorse! He filled

in wherever he was needed and he

never got hurt! And when he got

hurt, he played hurt.

MIKE THE MOOSE

You know I got a post card from him

here at the station. He says they're

all doing fine: Lucita's got the

kids in their new school already and

they all seem happy. She even found

an Ecuadorean grocery she likes.

Grocery -- the guy batted 340, from

both sides.

60.

His on-base percentage was in the

4's, with a rocket arm on defense

and an awareness of the field like

nobody's business. And they trade

him for minor leaguers? For untested,

greenhorn punks who can barely even --

MIKE THE MOOSE

(pauses the tape)

That guy's pretty normal.

He cues forward, plays. A GUY CALLER, fighting tears.

MIKE THE MOOSE

You just have to move on, Stan.

.I try to - I'm trying. But I

just can't make sense of this...

Mike the Moose stops the tape.

MIKE THE MOOSE

These are guys you wouldn't see crying

even at a funeral. Guys who can't

bring themselves to hug their own

children. And they're beside

themselves.

(shakes his head)

And all over a meaningless trade...

Meaningless?

Mike the Moose looks at him.

INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Roger and Gene are watching the KNICKS/HEAT game. Big bag

of Doritos between them.

.seventy-seven per cent from the

line during the regular season, and

a red-hot eighty-three per cent during

the playoffs.

Stop saying that!

61.

TV ANNOUNCER SIDEKICK

-- and in the fourth quarter of the

playoffs, that number is even higher --

Stop saying that!

So they really picked the wrong guy

to foul, at this crucial point in

such a crucial game.

ROGER AND GENE

Stop saying that!

He dribbles. He sets -- he dribbles

again...

Roger and Gene lean forward.

Come on come on come on comeoncomeon --

Miss the shot miss the shot miss the

shot come on and miss the shot --

-- and the Knicks call time out.

They lean back in their seats; breathe some relief.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Elaine and Kelly are addressing INVITATIONS by hand. Dave

sits on the counter, listens in.

They don't know the players. The

players don't know them - yet they

idolize these people. They follow

them from team to team -- and they

know more about these teams than

they know about their own families.

They might not even know if they

have families.

Not during the playoffs anyway.

62.

(amen to that; then)

And what gets me is, they think -

they really think - that whether a

team wins or loses or not depends on

how much they personally care about

them. Like if they don't care, the

team can't win.

But that's true.

They look over - see him on the counter.

What's true.

It's true that the level of concern

a guy shows for his team can affect

the outcome of the game.

(then off their looks)

I mean not just one guy - but lots

of guys. All the guys who care about

the team combined, if they really

care, can make a difference on the

scoreboard.

That's crazy.

Who is he?

(hops off the counter)

-- Follow me.

INT. THE DEN - CONTINUOUS

Roger and Gene and the game are FROZEN IN PLACE. Dave stands

in the doorway with Elaine and Kelly.

For the first time ever, through the

use of highly advanced technology,

we will be able to see the actual

Concern Rays emanating from the minds

of Roger and Gene, in their attempt

to affect the outcome of this upcoming -

and totally critical - foul shot.

63.

The PICTURE CHANGES as though a filter has been slipped over

the lens. Then we BEGIN TO SEE THE ACTUAL RAYS emanating

from Roger's and Gene's foreheads and traveling into the

screen. The rays are colored BLUE.

These Concern Rays go straight into

the television screen where they

join the combined Concern Rays of

all the other guy fans watching this

game right now.

A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES

Where all the CITIES representing major markets LIGHT UP and

FORM ARCS, like airline flight routes, connecting RED or

BLUE CONCERN RAYS from each city, and sending them to MIAMI.

(in front of map)

Then the rays are transmitted to the

actual arena itself, all arriving at

the same moment regardless of any

geographic or time zone differences.

EXT. AN ARENA - NIGHT

Dave reports as BLUE AND RED CONCERN RAYS materialize from

the sky and descend on the arena, covering the roof.

And it is here, at the arena, where

the combined Concern Rays from both

teams' fans will be measured - not

just for quantity, but for quality.

Because this - as every Guy must

believe - is what wins ball games.

BACK TO ROGER AND GENE AT THE TV

Dave steps away and the PICTURE UN-FREEZES.

He sets...he takes the shot...it's

-- Come on come on come on ---

64.

Miss the shot miss the shot miss the

ON TV - THE BALL, IN MIDAIR -- BLUE AND RED CONCERN RAYS

APPEAR AND CONVERGE ON IT, IN A MIGHTY STRUGGLE FOR DOMINATION

-- and he misses! He misses! It

bounces off the rim and Miami wins

the game! What a comeback! A field

day for the Heat!

Roger and Gene leap up and scream. High fives, victory dance.

Dave looks at Elaine and Kelly - who look at each other...

Let's get back to those invitations.

I'm with you.

They turn, go back to the kitchen. The celebration goes on.

TITLE CARD: "THE PUBLIC REST ROOM PROBLEM"

INT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

Dave walks down a terminal corridor among hurrying PASSENGERS.

If there's one thing women don't

know about when it comes to guys,

it's the public rest room problem.

And we're here to clear that up right

now.

He stops outside a MEN'S REST ROOM, which is currently closed

for maintenance.

This room is a private hell for a

countless number of guys -- yet the

women in their lives are completely

in the dark about it.

65.

But before we go inside, let's talk

with a leading social scientist, so

that what we're about to show you

sounds a little more official.

INT. RED CARPET CLUB - DAY

Dave is at the honor bar with the SAME BRITISH GUY. The

words "Leading Social Scientist" APPEAR under him this time.

LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST

One has to understand that the act

of emptying one's bladder goes deep

to the very roots of masculinity.

It is an important territorial

statement that males are genetically

programmed to carry out.

I see.

LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST

In fact, many of my colleagues believe

the reason that dogs howl at the

moon is because they can't go up

there and urinate on it -- which is

not, however, a theory which I

embrace. But guess who gets all the

grant money every year. The

bastards...

He stares off into space. A bitter man.

Um...you were saying?

LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST

I didn't want this job. Twenty years,

in the social sciences? And what

was everybody else doing -- they

were getting laid. They were going

to bed with women. And what have I

been doing -- applying for matching

grants. And not getting them.

66.

LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST (CONT'D)

Applying for any grants at all - and

not getting those either. Meanwhile

all the "cool dudes" are laughing!

EXT. "THE COOL DUDES WHO GET THE BIG GRANTS" TAVERN - DAY

Honda Accords fill the lot. TWO MORE drive up and a SCIENTIST

gets out of each. They hail each other and go in together.

As they pull open the door, LAUGHTER spills out from inside.

LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST (V.0.)

The bastards...

TITLE CARD: "THE PUBLIC REST ROOM PROBLEM"

EXT. A VIDEO PRODUCTION TRUCK - DAY

There is a SATELLITE DISH on top. Dave is with JOHN MADDEN.

With me now is the great John Madden --

legendary coach of football's Oakland

Raiders and veteran network analyst

for CBS Sports and now the Fox Sports

Network. John, thanks for coming by

today.

Happy to be here Dave.

John, you heard what our leading

expert said about this particular

anxiety that guys have regarding

bathrooms in general and public ones

in particular. Any thoughts?

Well he's exactly right, Dave. I

mean the guy was a little loopy but

he hit the nail on the head.

So an airport bathroom presents a

specific kind of challenge.

67.

The worst kind, Dave, and in a lotta

ways. Because a guy's main goal is

to get in and outta there without

having to deal in any other way with

any other guy - and in an airport

bathroom especially, with the turnover

rate they've got, he's up against

some pretty mean odds.

Couldn't agree more, John. Let's go

INT. VIDEO TRUCK - DAY - CONTINUOUS

TECHNICIANS wearing headsets. Dave and John sit by a BANK

OF MONITORS. There's a TELESTRATOR for John.

Okay. Now this angle here, we're

outside the bathroom and the

maintenance guy's just about to open

it up.

We SEE THE AREA OUTSIDE THE MEN'S ROOM, WITH "CLOSED FOR

MAINTENANCE" SIGNS IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH. A JANITOR starts

removing the signs as a BUSINESS TRAVELER heads over.

Here's our first candidate now --

INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS - ON MONITORS, WITH TELESTRATOR

John diagrams the action, marking up the screen like a

football play while the action unfolds.

Okay now the leadoff guy, he's gonna

come in, he's gonna see the open

field and he's gonna swing wide right

to grab a spot against the wall.

He's got one flank covered this way

and for now he's feelin' pretty good --

and of course by doin' that, he's

also settin' the tone for everything

that happens after.

ra . 68.

What's the main thing we're looking

for, John. What does each individual

guy feel he needs to get out of this.

Well the crucial thing here, is makin'

sure there's no eye contact. I mean

none - zero. These guys'll look up,

they'll look down, they'll look

straight ahead -- but a guy would

rather have you poke both his eyes

out with burning hot fire tongs,

Dave, than to give the next guy over

a reason to think you might be lookin'

at him in a public bathroom. For

reasons that oughtta be pretty darn

obvious.

Obvious indeed. Now here comes Guy

Number Two --

The SECOND GUY comes in; John diagrams the call.

Now Guy Number Two, what he's gonna

do is, he's gonna come in, see the

first guy in position along the wall

and right away he's gonna line up

wide on the opposite side. This is

a best case scenario here, something

both these guys can appreciate.

Plus they've opened up the middle

for the third guy --

The THIRD GUY comes in. John diagrams his path to the middle

urinal. The Guy goes there.

What about eye contact in this

situation.

Well you're still not likely to

encounter any, but again if you do,

that's what that buffer zone on either

side of him's for. And all three of

'em are feelin' pretty lucky to have

it, I can tell you that.

Okay. Now if things stay like this...

69.

If things stay like this, you're

fine - and if this were some small

commuter airport, y'know late at

night or somethin', then these guys

could possibly even be home free.

But we're talkin' Miami International

here, this is the big time, we're

talking about 747's, DC-10's, the

big jumbo jets dumpin' off three-

four hundred people at a clip. So

everybody's gonna be next to somebody,

which is the last thing any of these

guys want. You're in a critical

mass situation, and this is where a

lotta mistakes get made.

Which brings us to Guy Number Four.

Here he comes --

-- and there he goes...

Guy #4 spins around and leaves. John and Dave watch; then.

Now one thing that I know we're going

to get asked, John, especially from

women, is whether, as guys, we're

aware of how utterly stupid this

kind of behavior really is.

Well I think we know, Dave. Don't

you think we know?

I think we do.

Have to be stupid not to.

TITLE CARD: "THE PUBLIC RESTROOM PROBLEM"

70.

DAVE (V.O.)

We did that.

TITLE CARD: "GUYS AT MIDLIFE"

EXT. UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI - DAY

Dave walks the campus. Threads through GORGEOUS COLLEGE

GIRLS who don't know he's there.

If there's anything that causes more

anguish in a guy than sports anguish,

and public restroom anguish, and

hardware store anguish, it's the day

that he realizes that somehow his

life is half over now, and no matter

what he tries to tell himself, he's

not young anymore and he's never

going to be young again.

(then he stops)

And as any guy'll tell you - it sucks.

INT. AN ELEVATOR - DAY

A GUY IN A SUIT, alone in here. Faint ELEVATOR MUSIC plays.

I got used to having the Beatles and

Stones called 'classic rock.' Then

I heard Elvis Costello on an Oldies

station. I figured, okay - who cares -

at least it's on somewhere. But

then I hear "London Calling," on

Muzak. By the Clash. On Muzak.

But what the hell. I'm in a suit

and I go around all day explaining

peoples' 401K plans to them. And

Sting's doing commercials for Jaguar.

He shakes his head; it's hopeless.

INT. SHOPPING MALL BARBER SHOP - DAY

The BARBER talks while cutting Dave's hair.

71.

The way I see it, it's like menopause,

right? Except men get it different.

It doesn't show, y'see? The cramps

don't come, the hot and cold flashes,

and you don't have your magazines

and drug stores filled with helpful

stuff to do about it. But something

comes, and it hits every guy who's

living whether he likes it or not.

Whether he knows it or not. Guy can

lose his bleepin' mind if he doesn't

watch out.

He gets a mirror to show Dave the back. Gives him time to

get philosophical.

But you know? Maybe it's for the

better. Maybe whoever designed all

this, was afraid to let the men in

on what was gonna be happening.

Like if we knew, we'd bail or

something. You know, ahead of time.

INT. A BAR - DAY

The BARTENDER wipes the bar down in front of Dave.

I'm just telling you what I see.

Every lousy day. A guy'll come in

and sit down, right where you are.

He loosens up a little and then it

comes. The road not taken.

Unexamined choices. An unfulfilled

life. And other guys, they'll come

in and don't say a word. The ones

who just stare at the mirror.

That sounds pretty bleak.

I think it goes back to the old times.

Ancient times, you know? When nobody

was expected to live past forty.

You got to forty? You died.

72.

But now that men aren't doing that,

there's a lot more shit up ahead,

and none of it looks good so they go

freak out and make a mess of things --

they'll quit their jobs or walk out

on their marriages or make some other

idiot grandstand move. None of them

are happy and every single one of

them wishes he did something else

with his life and can't figure out

how it got this way. Every single

one of them.

INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY

A hotshot LAWYER is dictating a memo to his SECRETARY.

.therefore please be advised that

in reference to the aforementioned

subject matter, as per the original

agreement dated 7 March Two Thousand, --

His Secretary stops writing. Waits.

...7 March Two Thousand...

Um. You said that already.

(shakes his head)

I started here on the 7th of March.

Fifteen years ago...

Oh. Well - Happy Anni--

What the hell am I doing. Why did I

even think this would be a good idea --

to work my ass off every single day

of my life? So I could come in here

and dictate letters like this?

They're not all like this. You do a

lot of good...

And what does it get me -- a twin-

turbo convertible that I don't even

get to drive, because I'm always

traveling and renting shitbox cars

in other cities where all I do is

take clients out to lunch and tell

them how to negotiate their golden

parachutes? You ever sit in the

driver's seat of one of those renta

cars?

Well my husband usually does the --

Brand new cars, not even two thousand

miles on them, and already they drive

like camels. The seat's got no

cushion left already, and you're

lucky if you don't need a chiropractor

after twenty minutes in one. What

do people do in those things?

Maybe I could get you something.

You want something?

Yeah. I want something. I want the

number of that hang-gliding place

out on Route 33.

You want to go hang gliding?

I want to teach hang gliding.

I'm sorry. I didn't know you did

that.

I don't do that. I want to do that.

I've always wanted to do that, and

lots of other things too -- only I'm

stuck doing this all day long. And

I don't even know what this is half

the time, just that I have to spend

every waking hour doing it. So you

tell me -- where the hell does hang

gliding fit into that.

74.

Um. Saturdays?

Give me a break.

(as he starts to leave)

Where are you going?

I should have done this a long time

ago.

What about the letter?

Put in the usual bullshit. Nobody's

gonna read it anyway.

He's gone. She sits there.

EXT. JOHNNY LAKE'S HANG GLIDING CENTER - DAY

JOHNNY LAKE lifts a titanium frame up onto the back of a

pickup. Part of it catches on the lift gate and he SWEARS,

kicking it. About to really lay into it when the LAWYER

drives up in his twin turbo convertible and gets out.

Hi!

Sorry. We're closed.

(stunned; watches him)

-- It's two thirty in the afternoon.

Hey. I don't make the rules.

Aren't you the owner?

You're right. I do make the rules.

We're closed.

75.

(sees he means it)

Look, there has to -- I really want

to learn this -- I just quit my job

to learn this.

Be my guest - learn it.

He kicks the frame again, walks off. The Lawyer watches.

How can you do this? This is the

perfect job!

Yeah right. Driving around in a

rusted worthless pickup truck that's

about to be repossessed anyway, while

a guy like you, my own age, is going

around in a Porsche Carrera.

But you get to fly.

No, you get to fly. I get to hoof

this shit up and down these

godforsaken hilltops listening to

stockbrokers brag about getting lap

dances from college coeds, and

charging the whole thing through the

company expense account -- while I

can't even deduct my blood pressure

medication. That's what I get to

do.

He kicks a rock in the road, which almost feels good enough

so he kicks another one -- but this one is buried in the

dirt like an iceberg and doesn't budge --

Ahh, SHIT!

-- and he falls down hobbling on one knee instead.

INT. ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON'S OFFICE - DAY

Johnny Lake waits on the examining table, holding ice against

his leg. The Lawyer sits on the extra chair reading EXOTIC

ISLANDS MAGAZINE.

76.

He holds up a PHOTO: a Guy in a hammock, in Paradise.

Look at this.

You got that right.

The Lawyer shakes his head; flips the page.

Hey.

(then on Lawyer's

look; he shrugs)

You don't think he's gonna...

What.

You know. Have to use the --

Glove?

(then off his look)

You hurt your knee. He already took

the x-rays.

What if something's broken.

Well he's not going in that way.

You don't do a rectal to set a guy's

leg.

Still the guy looks doubtful. The ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON -

British, familiar - comes in, with a fresh X-RAY.

Well you've done quite a number on

yourself. Want to see?

Why should I. I wouldn't know what

the hell I'm looking at. You're the

one who went to medical school.

Don't remind me.

(then on their looks)

What. You think I like this?

ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON (CONT'D)

The medical profession? Owing my

life to the insurance cartel while

the rest of the world thinks I'm so

stinking rich?

Well.. .aren't you?

Of courseIam - I'm an orthopedic

surgeon!Ijust don't like people

assumingit!

And this -- I am so sick of this

bloody thing I can't even tell you!

Because every time it goes off it

means I have to stop doing one thing

I don't want to be doing, and start

doing another thing I don't want to

be doing. You call that a life?

They look at him. Don't know what to say.

-- Let me show you something.

(puts down the x-ray,

goes to a drawer)

I've been working on this during my

free time. Not like I get any.

He gets an accordion-style envelope; takes out a REAM OF

TYPED PAGES. Hands it over to Johnny Lake.

What is it?

What is it? It's a screenplay!

This'll blow the lid off the

orthopedic surgery industry! Look -

look here --

(takes it back; flips

-- no wait, this part's better. No --

here! Here you go. Read this and

tell me if you don't --

78.

He looks up. They're gone.

EXT. "GUYS WHO WISH THEY HAD DIFFERENT JOBS" TAVERN - DAY

The lot is filled with Ford Fiestas. The Lawyer and Johnny

Lake drive up. When they pull the door open there's WHINING

from inside...

Then the BARTENDER FROM BEFORE comes out, storms past them

and throws his rag down hard as he gets the hell out of there

and away from that shit job.

As Dave walks into frame, starts over to his car.

Okay! Well it looks like it's time

to talk about sex.

TITLE CARD: "THE PUBLIC RESTROOM PROBLEM"

DAVE (V.0.)

Will you knock it off?

EXT. SHOPPING MALL PARKING LOT - DAY

Dave gets out of his car and walks towards the mall.

For the sake of any younger viewers

who might still be paying attention,

during this next segment we will be

using certain euphemisms to describe

a natural and wonderful thing that

happens among grownups - grownups

besides your parents, that is.

INT. MALL BOOKSTORE - MAGAZINE AISLE - DAY

Dave walks along all the COSMO'S, REDBOOKS, etc.

Probably the fastest growing sector

of the U.S. economy is the sector

that conducts surveys asking women

what is wrong with men. And in all

those surveys, there is one main

area that shows up constantly at the

top of the charts.

(he stops, pulls a

-- Euphemisms.

INT. VICTORIA'S SECRET - DAY

Dave walks up the aisles filled with delectable things.

when I say "euphemisms," I of course

am not suggesting that guys don't

have them. Guys have plenty of

euphemisms. Most guys have more

euphemisms in a single day - and

here I am thinking of a day that

occurred in the summer between ninth

and tenth grades - than some women

have in a lifetime - or longer, in

the case of certain Math Teachers.

EXT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - DAY

Dave walks outside, past a line of SCHOOLKIDS off a BUS.

It all goes back to a time, millions

of years ago, when primitive males

often had to complete their part of

the equation quickly and right away

stand ready to fight off attackers.

INT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Dave walks past glassed-in DISPLAYS of CAVEMAN LIFE.

Today, however, women want euphemisms

too -- and this ability in males is

no longer as prized as it once was.

80.

In fact, when modern women describe

the qualities they're looking for in

the ideal man, the phrase "a real

fast shooter" is usually pretty far

down the list.

Naturally, it fell to guys to do

something about this. So, naturally -

they did.

EXT. A SKI CABIN - NIGHT

Dave stands outside while Kelly and Gene come back from

walking their dog. In a hurry.

one technique for holding back the

inevitable, is when the guy - just

when he is about to have his euphemism -

will hurl himself violently into an

iron bed railing, and raise a lump

on his head the size of a golf ball.

INT. THE SKI CABIN - CONTINUOUS

They come in the room, shedding clothes. He lifts her,

carries her to the bed -- with nothing but pillows against

the wall. He stops, panicked...

There's nothing there!

EXT. THE CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Dave watches the LIGHT GO OFF. Turns back to the CAMERA.

In cases where there aren't any iron

railings, a good backup technique

can be found right on the end of the

cold wet nose of the trusted family

dog.

CAMERA PANS to the window where we hear:

81.

Yes...yes...

.yesyesyesyes...yesyesyesyes...

.just hold on...yes...

.yesyesyesyesYEEE00000WWWW!!!

CAMERA PANS back to Dave.

There are also mental techniques --

INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roger and Elaine are under the sheets. Some good early

MOANING.. .as Dave comes in, holding a mike, interview style.

One of the most time honored and

reliable mental delaying styles, is

the Baseball Method --

(taps Roger's shoulder)

-- how's it going, Champ.

Roger pokes his head out of the blanket; stays active from

the neck down.

Oh - yeah hi.

then to Dave)

Well, the baseball thing. I mean a

while ago I was into that - big time.

You know, fooling around with

different lineups, mixing up the

batting order - like thinking about

what would happen if you took your

cleanup guy and made him eighth or

something -- just something stupid

like that, you know? Stuff you'd

never really do.

And that did the trick.

82.

Oh hell yeah. I mean I could go all

night - literally all night - just

shuffling my pitching staff around,

or thinking about who I might try

and sign at the winter meetings.

Hang on --

He goes under the blanket; pays more attention to Elaine...

then comes back.

The thing is, it got stale. And I

found after a while I wasn't enjoying

sex or baseball that much. And you

don't want to mess with that stuff.

So what do you do instead?

Math problems.

Really?

(off his nod)

You mean like if a train leaves

Chicago at one o'clock and another

train leaves Denver at two o'clock

and they're going at different speeds?

(shakes his head)

I can't do train ones. I always end

up imagining this beautiful girl on

the train - and it makes things even

worse.

Elaine stops. Pops her head out.

what beautiful girl.

-- You, Elaine. The girl on the

train is always you.

Oh, Roger...

83.

Roger gives Dave a close call look...then goes back to work.

INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Dave helps himself, makes a sandwich.

As you can see, a lot of guys are

making a tremendous effort here -

and yet, according to certain

standards they are still, basically,

lame as hell on almost every single

count. The reason for this is simple:

women set the standards.

(takes a bite)

And not just bedroom standards --

all standards. Because women invented

standards. Remember the Dawn of Guys?

EXT. PREHISTORIC CUL DE SAC - DAY

Long shadows. PRIMATE WOMEN are still at it, pounding roots

and dealing with PRIMATE KIDS.

INT. PRIMATE ROGER AND ELAINE'S CAVE - DAY

Primate Elaine, picking up around the cave. She stumbles on

something gross... finally has had it.

That's it.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAVES - DAY - LATER

Primate Elaine addresses the OTHERS. All SUBTITLES.

I've been thinking. We need some

standards around here.

What are standards?

84.

PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN

What is 'thinking?'

The others turn, look at her. Look back at Primate Blaine.

Standards are like rules. Things

they'll have to do. And things

they'll have to stop doing.

How about "no leaving your dirty

smelly loincloths wherever you feel

like it, and expecting me to do

something about it?" Can that be a

standard?

That can be one of the first.

PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN

How about "No gnawing on a fish head

during sex?"

There are all kinds of things we can

get them to do.

How? They're stronger than we are.

They smell stronger maybe.

PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN

(off their laughter)

I like the smell.

Of the men, or the rotten fish?

There's a difference?

More laughing; then they turn back to Primate Elaine.

But how will we make them go along?

Most of them can't even remember

which cave to come home to every

night. How are they going to remember

rules?

85.

We'll give them a Look.

A look?

A special look. A 'Certain Look.'

But we look at them every day. And

they still do whatever they want.

(as the others agree)

I've been working on this. Watch.

She turns to Primate Blonde Woman, who is holding a gourd.

On the Look, the Blonde drops the gourd.

See? And she wasn't even doing

anything.

Agreements and "Wows" go all around.

Now who's with me.

VARIOUS SHOTS, QUICK CUTS OF THE PRIMATE WOMEN TRYING TO GET

THE "LOOK" RIGHT. EVENTUALLY, EVEN PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN

GETS IT. . .ALTHOUGH AT ONE POINT SHE SCARES HERSELF AND DROPS

THE GOURD AGAIN.

EXT. TRAIL BACK TO THE CAVES - DUSK

The Primate Guys come back lugging ANIMAL PARTS. Each now

has his own ROCK, instead of the giant jagged slabs.

What are you doing later.

I don't know. Probably just stare

at the fire.

86.

A bunch of us are going over to

Primate Blonde Woman's cave to see

what she does with those gourds.

Want to come?

-- Can't. Primate Elaine's ancestors

are still here.

Bummer.

Tell me about it.

They are so Ice Age...

INT. PRIMATE ROGER AND PRIMATE ELAINE'S CAVE - NIGHT

Primate Roger watches Primate Elaine examine his NEW ROCK.

Her PRIMATE MOM AND DAD hover on the edge of the discussion.

I don't get it. What was wrong with

the other one.

This one's better. It's an upgrade.

PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER

What did he say it was called?

An 'upgrade.' An improvement on a

previous design.

PRIMATE ELAINE'S MOTHER

What? What'd he say?

PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER

(to his wife)

An upgrade. An grade.

(to Primate Elaine)

The guy said there are newer ones

coming out that'll make even this

one look primitive. They're getting

lighter and rounder every epoch.

PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER

What guy.

Primate Discount Manny.

PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER

Boy he must have seen this one

coming...

Dad.

(then to Primate Roger)

I just wanted to know what the

difference is between this one and

the one you had. You were so excited

about it when you got it, and now

you've gotten rid of it -- and the

only difference I can see is where

this one has these markings painted

on.

She holds it up; something like BASEBALL SEAMS going around.

Those make it so it travels better.

Painted on?

(off his look)

-- What'd it cost you.

Nothing. A couple wildebeeste steaks

and handful of seeds of some kind.

PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER

I told you.

(then to his wife)

Did I say he was a bum?

Who's a bum. Are you calling me a

bum?

PRIMATE ELAINE'S MOTHER

No one's calling anyone a bum.

PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER

I'm just visiting. You do what you

want.

88.

Oh yeah? Who do you think killed

your dinner tonight?

Look. Just take it back. Please.

But I can't do that! All sales are

final!

You can explain it to him. Tell him

he can keep the steaks, but we want

the seeds back.

PRIMATE ELAINE'S MOTHER

(to Primate Roger)

I don't mean to meddle. But you

should listen to your wife.

PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER

That's meddling! That's meddling!

(then to Primate Roger)

-- But in this case she's right.

(to her parents)

Look will you both stop?

(then to Primate Roger)

Just take this back. All right?

This is totally unreasonable!

Oh I get it. Don't tell me -- it's

your time in the moon cycle again --

He stops cold. Stunned by her CERTAIN LOOK. History's first

in SLOW MOTION, FROM SEVERAL ANGLES, the way they do it when

buildings explode in much bigger movies.

-- I'll take it back.

She smiles. FREEZE IMAGE.

EXT. MIAMI, BAYSIDE COMPLEX - DAY

Dave strolls among the SHOPPERS, TOURISTS etc. He has the

ROCK with him; tosses it unconsciously like a baseball.

89.

This is basically where we stand

today. The only difference is, we

have way more standards.

(gives the ROCK to a

KID passing by)

There are social standards, about

being sensitive - remembering

anniversaries, listening during

conversations, not eating soup with

your hands, or sitting around in

your underwear when company's over.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Dave goes up the escalator; walks through the kind of 'Home

Stylings' section where no other guy would go. Everything

he talks about is on display in some form.

-- And there are thousands of

standards for domestic life, involving

even more totally un-guy concepts --

like curtains, bedspreads, napkins,

special hangers, little soaps shaped

like fruit, and decorative boxes

that hold tissues that already come

in a box. While guys, left on their

own in the wild, will develop

lifestyles that don't involve any of

these things.

INT. COLLEGE GUY APARTMENT - DAY

COLLEGE ROGER and COLLEGE GENE stand in their doorway. There

is one window, a lot of dust and nothing else.

I know just what this place needs.

Hockey sticks.

They turn around to go buy hockey sticks.

90.

INT. THE SAME APARTMENT - SOME MONTHS LATER

A RABBIT on a lawn chair drinks beer out of an ashtray.

College Roger and College Gene play Indoor Death Hockey;

slamming into walls, scattering NEWSPAPERS and PIZZA BOXES -

as their IMAGE FREEZES.

of course, even by the most basic

standards, these two are living like

savages. But they honestly don't

know this -- because Guys, in their

natural state, aren't any more aware

of domestic standards than a trout

would be aware of the stock market.

And this causes women a lot of

concern.

EXT. SEATTLE - E-CAFE - DAY

Take laundry. To him his clean

clothes are ready when he's ready to

go get them. And they can dry the

rest of the way in the drawer. But

they don't dry the rest of the way

in the drawer, they sit there in

damp musty unfolded balls and he

doesn't even mind, and I can't figure

that out. What is the matter with

folding something? What is the matter

with waiting for it to be dry?

INT. DAVE'S CURRENT BEDROOM - DAY

Dave unloads a laundry basket on the bed. Starts folding

the clean clothes and making piles.

Laundry's a big issue - and a deep

and puzzling mystery to guys. My

own wife Michelle, for instance, is

an accomplished sportswriter and

mother of an extremely young child,

yet she is still able to maintain a

vigorous clothes-cleaning regimen

bordering on the super-human. And

I'm not allowed near the stuff.

91.

(comes in with more

He's right.

She dumps out the clothes, sees what he's doing and takes

over, doing it better. Dave picks up a random BLOUSE, shows

a LABEL with lots of printing on it.

These are clearly secret codes, that

women intuitively understand but

cannot adequately explain -- just

like how a lot of guys understand

the Infield Fly Rule, without being

able to explain that.

I can explain the Infield Fly Rule.

Because you're special, Sweetheart.

TITLE CARD: "GUY BASHING"

EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY

Dave anchors a semi circle with Sidra, Mia, Karla E and Lila.

They take turns focus group style.

Sometimes I think they're just like

tapeworms. You know? I mean

tapeworms are just tapeworms - that's

all they are, and all they'll ever

be. They're just these repulsive

little parasitic beasts and nobody

expects anything different from them -

because people know that's their

nature. And it's the same way with

guys - although a tapeworm's more

likely to help clean out the garage.

They have to be the biggest and they

have to be the best. And they can

never back down from a challenge.

Ever.

They sleep with your sister and wonder

what's wrong with that.

They will make a game out of anything.

A contest out of anything. Give

them a grain of sand and they will

figure out some game with it.

And they'll argue over the rules.

(off their agreement)

They leave their dirty dishes

everywhere. I can't believe the

places I'll find some crusted over

cereal bowl with yuckola blobs of

God knows what in them. And the

thing is, from his point of view?

They really do get cleaned by magic!

Because I can't take seeing them sit

there, so I clean them.

(to Karla E)

I just get him to wash my car when

that stuff happens.

Sweetheart he could wash my car with

his tongue and it still wouldn't

make up for where I find those dishes

sometimes.

(while they commiserate)

So now that we've heard your thoughts.

The frustration, the exasperation...

the obvious question comes to mind:

Why go through it? Why have guys in

your life at all?

They look at him.

-- You mean as a choice? You mean

like a mature adult choice to have a

guy in your life? In spite of

everything?

Like trying to borrow money from

you, after you've broken up, so he

can buy something for his new

girlfriend? And wondering what the

problem was with that? I mean like

really not knowing?

Dave looks at her. They all do. Until --

I'll tell you why. There is no good

reason, that's why.

The others turn, look her way.

-- I mean don't get me wrong. They

really can be fun. You know, like a

big stupid dog can be fun. I mean

not everything has to be so serious

in life. You want to be able to do

more with someone than just read

book reviews together - which is

something a guy would never do anyway.

(then as the others

But what a guy will do? Is at eleven

o'clock at night he'll show up at

your door and bring cheese steaks.

And he doesn't care that you look

all rumply and dreadful from not

expecting anyone. He might not even

remember that you're a vegetarian

and don't eat cheese steaks -- but

that doesn't really matter either.

Because the point is he wanted one,

and he can't come out and say it but

he didn't want to eat it alone.

And you're the person he thought of.

(off her look; nods)

I can't tell you what that feels

like, when they do that.

(a beat; and then)

I swear, if they knew how adorable

they are sometimes, they'd be

dangerous. I mean -- more dangerous.

The other Girls think about that. Considering...

94.

-- Bullshit. They're tapeworms.

The rest of them agree and all high-five her. Dave leans

back from the fray, turns to the CAMERA.

I think it's time for the conclusion

now.

TITLE CARD: "THE CONCLUSION"

EXT. JOHNNY LAKE'S HANG GLIDING CENTER - DAY

A SIGN says "UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT." Dave is on top of the

hill, in a rig that the EX-LAWYER is fastening him into.

Well now you know where things stand.

You've learned a little bit about

guys, and the critical roles they've

played in the past and in modern

society today. And for better or

worse, they're here with us to stay --

so the best thing you can do about

it, is continue to learn about them -

by coming to see this movie lots and

lots of times, and bringing more and

more of your friends back every time

you do. Because the more people

that understand guys, the better for

everyone. And the more people that --

(as the Lawyer launches

Off he goes. . .right out of frame, and --

FADE TO BLACK.

MUSIC AND END CREDITS BEGIN, AS --

A PICTURE OF ROGER AND ELAINE, IN ROGER'S CAR

SUBTITLE: Roger now owns a 104-piece tool set, and he has

successfully attempted to change his first switchplate.

A PICTURE OF ELAINE WITH HER HEAD AGAINST THE BASEMENT DOOR

95.

SUBTITLE: Elaine has an open line of credit with Steve.

A PICTURE OF GENE AND KELLY, AT A DANCE CLASS

SUBTITLE: Gene and Kelly won the Fred and Ginger Award in

three straight ballroom competitions. Gene was right; they

belong together.

A PICTURE OF SHERYL CROW, IN CONCERT

SUBTITLE: Sheryl Crow gave a concert in Central Park for

half a million people a while back. We weren't there, but

we have it on CD.

A PICTURE OF AGENTS LEOPOLD AND STEARNS

SUBTITLE: Agent Leopold and Agent Stearns were fired by the

FBI for gross incompetence. They now work in network

A PICTURE OF A BALLPLAYER, WITH HIS FACE BLURRED OUT

SUBTITLE: Rufino Lupenza is an imaginary ballplayer, created

by the filmmakers to prove a point. However, if he did exist,

and if he were any good, the Yankees probably would get him.

And that would suck.

A PICTURE OF JOHN MADDEN ON A TV SCREEN. WHICH THEN COMES

Now these are the kinda end credits

you like to see. You got the final

update thing goin', where you find

out how all the characters you've

been watchin' are gonna turn out.

You got good music, a lively kinda

feel, and maybe most of all, the

movie itself isn't too long --

He reacts now, looking down at the TAIL CREDITS as they start

speeding up.

96.

-- that's how you know it's a real

movie, in my book. That's how you

know it's not some boring kinda art

piece made by these tortured head

case kids fresh outta film school --

you're not gonna come outta this

theater talkin' about symbolism, or

the use of darkness and light or any

kinda mumbo-jumbo like that -- you

come out of this movie and you're

laughin'. And that's what I like in

a movie - a movie that's funny but

it doesn't take forever, you know?

You still got some time to do

somethin' after, maybe go get

somethin' to eat, y'know? Because

the guys behind the thing knew enough

not to drag on and on and --

TITLE CARD: "THE END"

As the MUSIC FADES.. .and it's QUIET. A good quiet...

DAVE (V.0.)
