We see a FLORIST making a funeral arrangement.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

CLOSE UP of another headstone that has the director's name

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

MUSIC CUE: The music fades out.

TIGHT SHOT on AARON (CHRIS ROCK) thirties, dressed in a black

suit and tie. He looks straight ahead with a somber expression.

The camera pulls back to reveal he is watching FOUR UNDERTAKERS

(INCLUDING BRIAN) place a coffin on a raised platform.

2.

The living room has been prepared for the funeral service, with

several rows of chairs laid out.

Would you like to see...

Aaron nods his head "yes", as BRIAN begins to open the coffin.

Aaron crosses to the coffin.

There's a dramatic moment as Aaron moves to the coffin and

braces himself for what he's about to see. The coffin opens and

Aaron stares long and hard at the body.

Brian... who is that?

Excuse me?

Who is this man I'm looking at?

'Cause it's not my father.

Are you sure?

Are you asking me if I'm sure I know

what my father looks like?

People make mistakes in times of

grief.

Man, look at the damn body!

Brian peers into the coffin. We see it's an ASIAN MAN.

Oh shit!

The other undertakers look embarrassed.

Come on, Brian. You know what my

father looks like. He used to take

you to little league.

I'm sorry, man. I got a little

nervous. This almost never happens.

3.

It's happened before?! You mean this

is a normal thing?... This isn't

Burger King. You can't just mess up

my order.

I think I know where he is.

You think?

INT. ASIAN FUNERAL - SAME TIME

Close up of the casket opening. People look confused. The MAN

looking into the coffin speaks Chinese with subtitles.

That's not my father.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

I better .,see my dad in this coffin in

an hour, or you're going to take his

place.

The undertakers pick up the coffin and shuffle out awkwardly.

Don't worry. I'll get him, man.

You do that.

My people, my people, my people...

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Aaron enters the bedroom. His wife, MICHELLE, also thirties,

attractive, is putting on makeup with a thermometer hanging from

her mouth. Aaron stands looking dumbfounded.

They brought the wrong body. Can you

believe that?

4.

(muffled because of

The wrong body?! Do they know where

he is?

They think so. They're getting him

now.

The thermometer beeps and Michelle removes it from her mouth..

I told you not to use Marshals. But

no, you wanted to keep it in the

neighborhood. I know Swartz costs a

little more, but at least they know

where the bodies are.

Michelle writes something down on a piece of paper as Aaron

crosses the room and sits on the bed.

You were right. Please don't rub it

in, not today. I've got so much to

worry about.

Michelle gets up and heads to the bathroom as Aaron takes out

some index cards and looks them over.

Dad insisted on having the funeral

here, Mom's crying all the time, Ryan

didn't help with anything, not like he

ever does! Plus my eulogy sucks. I

can't wait until this day is over.

MICHELLE (O.S.)

Oh come on, honey. I'm sure it's not

that bad.

If it is, at least Dad's too dead to

hear it.

Michelle exits the bathroom.

Honey, it's going to be fine.

5

It doesn't matter what I write. All

anybody's going to be thinking is "why

isn't Ryan doing the eulogy? Even I'm

going to be thinking it.

She holds him close.

Baby, you're the oldest. You have to

do the eulogy. Besides, I think

you're just as good a writer as your

brother. You just need to let someone

read your book.

Aaronlooks away.

Soon. It's not ready to be read yet.

I'm sure it's fine. Once the

funeral's over, and everything dies

Aaron gives her a look.

Sorry. Look, once this is all over,

you know your mom's thinking about

selling the house, so you know we've

got to get out.of here.

Aaron looks a little uncomfortable and heads to the bathroom.

You called them, right?

Silence from Aaron in the next room.

Aaron?... You put the down payment on

the condo, right?

AARON (O.C.)

I said I'd take care of it and I'll

take care of it.

Michelle looks frustrated and crosses into the bathroom.

6.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Aaron is at the mirror.

You better, because I can't live with

your mother anymore. I've done my

time, now it's time for your brother

to take over. From now on, it's only

Christmas and birthdays for us. Once

we move, we can concentrate on your

writing and our baby.

Michelle gets down on her knees and starts unzipping Aaron's

pants. Aaron pulls back.

Hey, hey, hey. Are you serious? We

have to do this today?

Michelle is still on the ground.

Yes. Today's the last day of this

cycle.

Can I at least find the body first?

EXT. FREEWAY - WIDE SHOT - DAY

We see NORMAN'S CAR speeding along the freeway.

INT. NORMAN'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

NORMAN, black, slightly heavier and riddled with anxiety, is

driving. His friend, DEREK, an attractive, white, clean cut

doctor, rides in the passenger seat.

I hate funerals. It's all death,

death, death.

I don't think funerals are designed

for anybody to really like.

I don't want a regular funeral. When

I die, I want people to celebrate my

life.

Death at a Funeral 02/6/09

Not me. I want it to be the saddest

day ever. I want the stock market to

stop. Schools to close. And no

garbage pick-up.

Derek starts to light a cigarette.

You still smoke?

You used to smoke.

I used to piss my pants too, but I

stopped. The only thing I want black

is my skin. At least open the window.

Derek opens the window very slightly.

I've got enough problems of my own to

deal with.

Yeah? What problems?

I told you... About the rash...

Got to use condoms.

.on my hand...

Still got to use condoms.

Look at it.

but he doesn't take a great deal of interest.

That's not a rash.

What is it?

B.

I don't know, but it doesn't look

right.

Oh, damn.

Norman continues to drive. Derek continues to smoke.

If you hate funerals so much why are

you coming?

You know why.

Come on, man, leave Elaine alone.

I can't. She's the one.

So you're going to win her back over a

dead body?

If I have to.

INT. ELAINE'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

ELAINE, very attractive, 27, and her boyfriend OSCAR, white, 35,

are driving along wearing funeral attire. Oscar looks quite

anxious as he keeps his eyes firmly on the road.

Are you okay?

Yeah, just a little nervous...

About seeing my dad?

I just don't think I've ever been so

openly hated by anyone before.

He doesn't hate you. He just loved

Derek.

9.

Great. That makes me feel much

better.

At least you know it's not you, so try

not to get so nervous when he's

around.

I can't help it. He puts me on edge.

I feel like I owe him money.

He's going to be more.concerned that

his brother-in-law just died. He

won't be focused on you. Anyway, when

I tell him we're getting married,

he'll have to accept you.

Elaine takes his hand. As they exchange a loving look, Oscar

takes his eyes off the road for just a brief moment. Suddenly

there's a BUMP!!! And we see a bicyclist flying over Oscar's

car. Oscar screeches to a halt. They jump out of the car.

Oh my God. Are you okay?

The guy gets up. He's fine.

Yeah, I'm fine.

Are you sure? Is anything broken?

I'm so sorry.

It was my fault. I ran a light.

Oscar starts hyperventilating.

I could have killed you. What if you

had cracked your head open? I'd have

blood on my hands!

Elaine shakes him.

Oscar, calm down!

10.

You heard the man, he ran a light.

Come on, let's get out of here before

he wants to sue.

She grabs him and pulls him into the car.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

The camera is close on Michelle's head which is moving back and

forth. We pull back to reveal Aaron. They are doing it

standing up.

What's taking you so long?

I just started.

You want this baby as much me. Come

on.

I'm trying.

If I didn't want you to come, you

would have done it five minutes ago.

Do I have to do this today?

The door opens and a HOUSEKEEPER sticks her head in.

Who's picking up Uncle Russell?--

Aaron and Elaine quickly pull apart. As the Housekeeper steps

back out into the hall.

Oh shit, Uncle Russell.

Aaron fixes his pants as he exits the room.

INT. NORMAN'S CAR MOVING - DAY

Norman's cell phone RINGS. He answers.

Hello?... How are you?... Okay..

11.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

I need you to pick up Uncle Russell.

INT. NORMAN'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

Uncle Russell?! Damn! He's always in

a bad mood.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

It's not a mood if he's always in it.

It's his personality. Can you do it?

INT. NORMAN'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

Alright... 'Alright. I'll do it. See

you soon. Bye.

Norman hangs up irritated.

EXT. WIDE SHOT OF A FREEWAY - DAY

We see Norman's car exiting the freeway.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Aaron and Michelle are standing to the side as the undertakers

place the coffin on the stand.

Brian nervously lifts the lid and Aaron looks inside.

So is this your father?

Come on, man. You know that's my

father.

Just trying to be professional. What

up, Michelle?

Brian.

12.

He closes the lid and all four undertakers quietly head off.

Aaron looks up and sees his mother, Cynthia, has entered the

room. Cynthia is clearly drained and tired. She stares at the

coffin.

Mom, how are you feeling?

There were so many things we wanted to

do... We were going to go to China.

China? You don't even like Chinese

food.

That's not the point. I haven't been

feeling good. Who knows how long I'm

going to live without him. It happens

all the time. One spouse goes and

then the next. I mean, it might be

different if I had a grandchild to

take my mind off of everything.

Cynthia, I--

They all cross to the coffin.

(cuts Michelle off)

Come on, Mom. You're healthy. You'll

be fine. You've got your friends and

family...

Cynthia, Aaron and Michelle stand around the coffin.

Where is Ryan? Have you heard from

him?

He'll be here soon.

Just seeing that boy's face makes me

feel better. I've missed him so much.

My baby.

13.

She looks down at the coffin. Aaron turns away frustrated.

Michelle gently touches the coffin.

Do you need anything, Cynthia?

Yeah, you can get your hand off my

husband's coffin. You're leaving

smudge marks.

Michelle tries to wipe it off with her sleeve.

EXT. STREET - JEFF'S HOUSE - DAY

MUSIC: "PAPER PLANE" by M.I.A.

Elaine and Oscar are walking up the stairs of a typical college

apartment building.

INT. JEFF'S HOUSE - SAME

The music is coming from Jeff's speakers. JEFF, dressed for the

funeral, sits at his desk. He's holding a pill bottle that

says: "VALIUM."

Yeah, I found them. The ones in the

Valium bottle?... Yeah... I'll get

them to you this evening... Can't do

this afternoon... It's your fault you

left them here... I've got a

funeral... My uncle died... Yeah,

tragic... No, I haven't taken any. I

saw what they did to you... What are

they anyway?...

The doorbell rings.

I've gotta go, my sister's here...

I'll take them with me and stop by

after the funeral... Bye.

The doorbell rings again.

Hang on!

Jeff stands up and we see that he's only half dressed for the

funeral. He doesn't have any pants on.

14.

He puts the bottle on the counter then crosses to the door and

lets Elaine and Oscar inside.

Hey, what's up?

Do you always open the door half

naked? Come on, Jeff. We're going to

be late.

I've just got to put my pants on and

I'm ready.

Oscar is still a little shaky.

Is he okay?

Oscar's freaked out. A guy on a bike

ran into the car.

It came out of nowhere. I didn't see

him. I'm sorry.

It's okay, baby.

(then to Jeff)

Go put your damn pants on.

I'm going. I'm going.

Jeff heads off to the bathroom and closes the door. Elaine

spots the bottle of Valium on the table and picks it up.

Here. Take this..: It'll calm you

down.

What is it?

It's just Valium.

(gets a glass of water)

I used to take them all the time...

It'll make you feel better, promise.

15.

Are you sure? I mean, I've got to

drive.

It'll be okay. I'll drive, honey.

Come on, open wide.

She pops the pill in his mouth and hands him some water. Oscar

swallows.

Jeff returns wearing pants.

Ready. Let's do it.

Oscar and Elaine leave, Jeff surreptitiously picks up the Valium

bottle, puts it in his pocket, then follows them out.

INT/EXT. ENTRY WAY - SAME TIME

CAMERA is in the entry way now shooting outside. A TOWN CAR

exits, leaving Ryan in front of the house. RYAN, Aaron's

younger brother is taller, more confident, and more successful.

He moves slowly towards CAMERA and through the front doorway as

CAMERA PULLS BACK with him.

Hello! Mom!

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Michelle, Aaron and Cynthia are on the couch as Ryan enters the

living room.

Ryan!

Cynthia runs over to Ryan and flings her arms around him. Aaron

looks a bit lost in the background with Michelle but they walk

over.

I know this is hard, Mom. But you're

going to be okay.

You always know exactly what to say,

Ryan. I'm so glad you're here.

I'm always here for you, Mom.

16.

I guess if people died every week,

we'd see you all the time.

Ryan turns to Aaron and Michelle.

Aaron, how are you?

I'm alright.

How was the flight?

Okay. I had to buy the seat next to

me because I don't trust the airlines

with my bags. And there was a lot of

turbulence... I guess that's the

thing about flying first class. It

doesn't matter how much you pay if the

plane crashes, you still end up dead--

uh...

Ryan realizes what he's said and stops speaking abruptly. It's

too much for Cynthia who rushes upstairs.

"End up dead"?

Oh damn.

I'll make sure she's okay.

Michelle heads off upstairs.

EXT. LAKEVIEW RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - SAME TIME

We see Norman's car turn into "Lakeview Retirement Community."

He drives past the sign and through a gate.

INT. NORMAN'S CAR/EXT. LAKEVIEW - DAY

Norman is driving behind three OLD LADIES on mobile chairs.

He's honking at them. He finally sees Uncle Russell.

There he is.

17.

You didn't tell me the guy was in a

wheelchair.

UNCLE RUSSELL, an elderly man in a wheelchair, sits in his

chair.

Norman drives forward and stops alongside the old man. He rolls

down his window and speaks very slowly with a huge smile on his

face.

Hello, Uncle Russell. How are you?

We're here to take you to the funeral.

Where the fuck have you been, you fat

bastard? You're late. If you took

any longer I'd be dead, too.

The fake smile falls off Norman's face.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Ryan sees the coffin and slowly heads over with Aaron trailing

behind. He stands over the coffin. It finally registers that

his DAD is actually in there.

It's hard to see Dad like this. But

he's in a better place now.

When does dead beat sick?

I guess you're right. This is why I

try not to get close to people.

There's too much emotion involved.

Well that explains why you never call.

What do you want me to say? Some

families talk to each other all the

time, some just see each other at

funerals. That's us.

I guess it is.

18

Aaron sits as well.

What money?

The money for all this... the funeral.

You're supposed to pay half.

What about the insurance?

That's Mom's money.

What about the pension?

That's Mom's money.

Oh.

So we're spliting the cost.

Are we?

Yes. We are.

Oh, okay.

So?

I don't have it right now.

What do you mean, you don't have it?

You just bought a first class seat for

your bag.

19.

And that's why I don't have any cash.

INT.. ELAINE'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

Elaine is now driving, Oscar is sitting in the passenger seat

looking a little spaced out, with Jeff in the back.

Jeff leans forward.

So, poor old Uncle Eddie...

Yeah. But he was sick for so long.

He's much better off now.

Dead? Since when does dead beat sick?

Shut up, Jeff.

Jeff turns his attention to Oscar.

I love when you come to family

functions, Oscar. Because then Dad

focuses all his hate on you.

window. The pills are starting to kick in.

Oscar?

Was there a dog in here just now?

Elaine looks at Oscar very-strangely.

What?

He sniffs.

Dalmatian? No, Schnauzer...

A beat.

20.

What the hell are you talking about?

Oscar falls silent and just goes back to looking out the window.

INT. NORMAN'S CAR - LATER

Uncle Russell is asleep in the back. Norman is looking for a

parking space, but the street and long driveway are packed with

cars. A catering truck and flower van are taking up a lot of

space.

There's nowhere to park.

Then the small flower delivery van pulls out. Derek points out

the newly empty space.

That truck is pulling out. Park

there.

Alright.

Just as he's about to drive in, another car takes it.

What the hell?

EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Norman gets out of the car. The other car contains Jeff, Oscar

and Elaine. Jeff gets out first followed by Elaine.

Elaine, I was going to park there.

Are you family, Norman?

Well, no, but I'm like family.

No such thing.

Derek leans out the window.

Hi, Elaine.

21.

What are you doing here?

Your father invited me.

Oh please.

She grabs Oscar and heads to the house followed by Jeff.

INT. NORMAN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Norman gets back into his car. Uncle Russell stirs.

What's happening?

Did you see that?... She totally blew

me off.

The flower delivery van has been waiting to move forward. It's

driver beeps the horn.

I said what's happening? Are we

there?.

Norman turns around and looks at Uncle Russell.

Aw, damn. I have Uncle Russell. How

could I forget about Uncle Russell?

Derek has other concerns and the van beeps again.

(to the Van)

Yeah, alright!!

What the hell is going on?

Uncle Russell pokes Norman with his cane.

Ow.

.barely even looked.

22.

Norman, now highly irritated, is forced to drive backwards.

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

Oscar, Elaine and Jeff are walking to the house as other people

arrive.

It's very green here, isn't it?...

Green... Very green... Very...

green.

Elaine takes Oscar to the side.

Oscar, are you alright?

What do you mean?

All this talking about phantom dogs

and things being green... What's

going on?

What are you talking about? I' fine .

Never been greener.

Oscar wanders off, leaving Elaine with Jeff.

Elaine, what's wrong with Oscar?

I don't know. Something's not

right...

ANGLE ON: Oscar as he wanders around the yard.

I think it's the Valium.

Valium?!

I gave him a Valium at your place. I

think he's just not used to it.

Oh, right.

23.

Jeff's face reveals his realization of what's happened. He

walks off, leaving Elaine watching Oscar.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

Norman's car is almost at the corner still being forced

backwards by the flower van. We see that Derek is still lost in

his own thoughts.

Uncle Russell is poking at Norman with his cane.

You're going the wrong way!

Ow! That hurts.

Stop the car, Norman.

What?

Stop the car. I have to speak with

her. I have to speak with Elaine.

Norman reluctantly stops the car. Derek gets out.

What about Uncle Russell? I need help

with Uncle Russell!

It's too late. Derek is gone. The van in front of Norman honks

the horn.

What's going on here? Where are we?!

We're going to be late!

Russell hits him on the arm with his cane.

Ow! Can you please stop doing that?!

The van keeps beeping. Norman backs up.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Ryan is standing with Aaron. They greet the mourners.

24.

Nice to see you again.

The mourner shakes hands with Ryan then walks away.

Who are all these people? I don't

even recognize half of them.

It's your family. You don't recognize

them from the last funeral?

Ryan looks around the room.

So what side of the family is he on?

Who?

The guy in the leather jacket.

Ryan looks around the room and sees a FOUR FOOT SIX MAN (FRANK)

approaching the coffin.

I have no idea. Maybe a friend of

Dad's from work or something.

Aaron turns to Ryan.

So, you're telling me I'm going to

have to pay for the whole funeral?

No I'm telling you you'll have the

money in a few months when I get my

advance.

I'm not a God damn credit agency!

REVEREND DAVIS, a very calm, serene woman, suddenly appears.

Aaron, how are you?

25.

Yes, um... We're just waiting for

everyone to arrive, then we can get

going. I know you're in a hurry.

Yes, I have two more funerals and a

Christening. I don't know what it is

about the Spring, but they're either

coming in or going out.

She laughs, but Aaron and Ryan just look at her. Reverend Davis

stands there waiting to be introduced to Ryan.

Have you met my brother, Ryan?

Ah, the writer, of course. I must

admit I squeezed this job in because I

wanted to meet you. I'm reading

"Mama's Secret" right now. Don't tell

anybody, I'm not supposed to be

reading that kind of stuff.

I'm sure the Lord will forgive you.

Aaron is irritated.

You must be very proud of your big

brother. He really made something of

his life.

I can't wait to hear your eulogy.

No, no, I'm doing the eulogy.

Oh. I thought...

Aaron is the oldest.

The reverend tries her best not to look disappointed.

Great... Well, I'll just make sure

have everything I need.

26.

She looks at the coffin and then at the Bible in her hands.

REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D)

We've got a body and a Bible. Well,

I'm all set.

She walks off.

Look, I think you should do the

eulogy. Everyone's expecting you to

do it.

No, they're not. You're the oldest.

You should do it.

Look most of the people are here for

Dad, but let's not kid ourselves. A

lot of them are here to hear your

eulogy.

So imagine how surprised they'll be

when they hear yours.

Ryan walks away.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Cynthia is helping prepare the food to go.out. Michelle is in

the background at the sink. DUNCAN, Cynthia's brother, a middle

aged doctor, approaches.

How's my little sister?

I'm trying to hold it together,

Duncan. He was a really good husband.

My friends always told me about the

crap their husbands put them through.

I never had to deal with any of that.

Remember when Uncle Matt got that

nanny pregnant?

That was horrible.

27

They don't make 'em like my Edward

anymore. A good husband and a great

father to two healthy, strong boys.

Michelle cringes in the background.

I'll make you a cup of coffee,

Cynthia.

Coffee can do many things Michelle,

but it can't bring back the dead.

Beat.

Tea?

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Aaron finds a quiet place in the hallway and pulls out his

notes.

"My father was an exceptional man...

My father was an exceptional man...

My father was an exceptional man..."

Michelle approaches him.

Honey, we still need to finish that

thing. Remember today is the last

day.

Can we talk about this when there's a

little less death in the air?

No. No we can't.

Honey, I'm just not in the mood...

I don't have any panties on.

28.

What? You don't have any panties on?

It's my father's funeral.

I'm just trying to help you out. I'll

put them back on before the service

starts. Now come on.

They turn. Aaron looks around the corner into the living room

and sees the four foot six man standing by a table. Aaron stops

Michelle.

Babe, don't make it obvious, but that

guy in the leather jacket standing by

the wall. Don't look. Don't look.

Don't look.

Michelle catches a glimpse of the guy.

Do you recognize him?

Isn't that the guy from the Home

Depot?

No, I don't think so. Don't look.

Don't look.

Did he put in the cable?

No, no, that's not it. He keeps

looking at me. Don't look. Don't

look.

He's probably just a friend of your

father's. I'll meet you in the

garage. We have a few minutes before

Uncle Russell gets here.

Michelle walks off. Aaron peeks around the corner again and

makes eye contact with the four foot six inch man, who seems to

be staring straight at him. Aaron averts his eyes and heads

off.

29.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Norman parks the car and gets out. He goes to the trunk and

removes the wheelchair.

What are you doing?! Be careful with

that.

Uncle Russell bangs his cane on the floor impatiently.

UNCLE RUSSELL (CONT'D)

Hurry up, we're late.

Norman slams the trunk closed.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Aaron tries to get across the room as Michelle heads into the

kitchen.

Ryan stops Aaron.

Oh, Ryan can you keep an eye out--

God damn, that Martina has grown up.

ANGLE ON: MARTINA, nineteen and attractive.

Are you talking about Little Martina?

She was like a teenager when I left,

and now she's... you know. She's like

damn.

Aaron looks distastefully at his brother.

Can you keep an eye out for Uncle

Russell?

I think I should go see how she's

been.

Yeah, why don't you do that? See if

she wants a juice box.

30.

Ryan heads off towards Martina. Aaron continues across the

room.

FRANK (O.S.)

Hi there.

Aaron turns and finds himself cornered by Frank.

Hello.

I was really sorry to hear about your

dad. He talked about you a lot. I

saw your wedding pictures. Your

wife's dress was very beautiful.

Aaron is a little uncomfortable.

Uh... thanks.

Did he ever mention me?... Frank?

Frank steps forward and holds out his hand. Aaron shakes it.

Frank?... I don't think so, no...

Were you a friend of his?

Something like that, yeah.

Michelle sticks her head out of the kitchen.

Honey. Can I see you for a moment?

Well, nice to meet you. Thanks for

coming.

Aaron walks away, leaving Frank alone.

EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

WIDE SHOT: Norman struggles to push Uncle Russell up a hill.

31.

Come on, put your back into it.

You're supposed to be a young man.

Don't you have any strength?

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Aaron has almost made it across the room when he is intercepted

by Reverend Davis.

I think we should get started.

really have to leave at three.

Sure. Can we just wait five minutes

for my Uncle Russell? We can't start

without him.

.Of course.

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

Elaine and Jeff are talking to some mourners.

It's so nice to see you.

I'm so sorry to hear about your uncle.

But he's in a better place now. I

hear Ryan is doing the eulogy.

Oscar, carrying a leaf, interrupts the conversation.

Look... Isn't it beautiful?

He wanders off again. Elaine doesn't know what the hell is

going on.

Elaine, can I speak to you for a

minute?

(to the mourner)

I'll see you inside.

Jeff takes Elaine's arm with some urgency and moves off to the

side.

32

What? What is it?!

I have to tell you something and, I'm

warning you in advance, you're not

going to like it.

Elaine looks at Jeff concerned.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Aaron is intercepted again by Duncan who is talking to Ryan.

Aaron. How are we doing on time?

As soon as Uncle Russell gets here

we'll be ready to start.

So what's this I hear about Ryan not

doing the eulogy?

I was just telling him how much I'm

looking forward to hearing your

eulogy.

That's a shame. I mean, I'm sure

you'll be good, Aaron. It's just with

Ryan being the writer of the family...

Yeah.

There are people here that don't even

know your father. They just came to

hear Ryan.

Would you excuse me?

Aaron walks away.

So any new books coming out? I just

finished "Black Hurt.

33.

INT. GARAGE - SAME TIME

Aaron closes the door behind him. Michelle is waiting. They

start kissing and pulling at each other's clothes. Aaron stops

and leans on the door and sighs.

Are you alright?

Every single person wants Ryan to do

the eulogy. He was my father, too.

I'm supposed to do the damn eulogy!

I'm the oldest. Where was Ryan when I

was taking care of Dad?

Calm down. Calm down. Forget about

everyone. You're going to do the

eulogy and it's going to be the best

eulogy anyone's every heard. Now

could you please do me a favor and get

me pregnant?

Come on, do I have to do this today?

Yes. What do you want? You want me

to talk dirty? I'm gonna suck it.

I'm gonna to suck it.

Before Michelle can continue her PG rated dirty talk, there is a

knock on the door.

Is there more soda in here?

Yes! Come in!

Michelle is frustrated.

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

Elaine is looking at Jeff in absolute shock.

What do you mean it's not Valium?

34.

I mean what you thought was Valium,

wasn't actually Valium. It's a

hallucinogenic. Like, acid,

mescaline... Special K...

Oscar moves in the background behind Elaine and Jeff. Elaine

looks at him. He's making strange contorted expressions with

his face and pointing at the sky. Other people are starting to

notice him and think he's slightly odd.

This isn't funny, Jeff.

I'm not being funny. Look at him,

he's high as a kite!

Oscar sticks his head into a huge bush.

What the hell are you doing leaving

that stuff around your house?!

A friend left it. And who the hell

just goes into someone's house and

takes pills?

I thought they were Valium!

(takes a deep breath)

What am I supposed to do? Should I

tell him?

No, don't do that. It'll just freak

him out... We'll just keep a close

eye on him, and make sure he doesn't

get out of control... And don't let

him spend too long talking to one

person... or bush.

Oscar wanders into the front door. Elaine quickly follows him.

Jeff reluctantly follows Elaine. Derek arrives in time to see

this and follows as well.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Oscar wanders in, followed by Elaine and Jeff. Duncan sees them

enter and approaches them.

35.

Hi, Dad. How are you?

She gives him a kiss.

Not bad considering we're at a

funeral.

Jeff steps forward.

Hi, Dad.

He shakes his hand.

How's Pepperdine treating you? Is

Professor Clarke still giving you a

hard time?

No, no. It's all worked out. Don't

worry.

I'm not worried about you.

Duncan looks pointedly at Elaine, irritating her. Duncan looks

at Oscar who is in the background.

So I see you brought your friend.

He's my boyfriend. And you know his

name.

Derek approaches.

Doctor, how nice to see you again.

Derek. How are you doing at the

hospital?

Great. Great. We should have lunch

soon. I'd love to hear what you think

about the new pediatric wing at

Cedar's.

36.

Definitely. Maybe Elaine would like

to join us for lunch?

They both look expectantly at Elaine who looks away disgusted.

Cynthia comes up to them and kisses Elaine and Jeff hello.

Oscar stares at her.

Elaine... Jeff... good to see you.

I'm so sorry, Auntie. We're going to

miss Uncle Edward so much.

Yeah. He was a great guy.

Thank you.

Oscar, this is my Aunt--

Oscar grabs Cynthia in a tight hug.

I'm so sorry about... the death...

He sings "Amazing Grace" softly as Duncan, Derek, Jeff and

Elaine look on.

Amazing Grace / How sweet the sound /

That saved a wretch like me...

Cynthia untangles herself from Oscar. She heads back outside.

Duncan gives Elaine a look, then heads off after Cynthia.

What are you going to do?

I don't know. I can't leave. Aunt

Cynthia would never speak to me again.

Jeff notices that Oscar has left. He rushes outside. Elaine

follows. Derek follows suit.

37.

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

We see Oscar emerging from the front doorway followed by Jeff.

Then comes Elaine.

Jeff approaches Oscar and stands with him as Elaine watches from

the doorway. Derek walks up.

You look nice, Elaine.

I'm dressed for a funeral.

Yeah, but you make death look sexy.

She looks at him.

So, I heard about the engagement.

Hey, hey. I don't really have time to

deal with whatever happened between

you and me. But I have not told my

dad yet, so I would appreciate it if

you would keep your mouth shut.

Sure. Anything for you.

Derek looks over and notices Oscar looking bewildered.

So that's him? That's the man you're

going to spend the rest of your life

with?

Elaine looks over at the drugged up Oscar. Oscar leans over

like he's on a nod. Jeff leans down with him, watching. Right

before Oscar falls over, he comes up really fast.- Then he

starts walking.

Yep, that's him.

Oscar who has been walking in circles with a look of awe on his

face, changes direction and flies by Elaine and Derek back into

the house with Jeff in tow.

38.

Elaine., I-

Elaine follows the guys, leaving Derek behind.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Aaron is straightening his tie and practicing his eulogy.

My father was an exceptional man...

My father was--

Frank again approaches Aaron.

Actually, there's something I'd like

to talk to you about... when you have

a minute.

Aaron hears Uncle Russell in the background.

Yeah, that's great. Do you mind if we

do it later though? My uncle just got

here.

Sure.

Aaron heads off.

EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE - SAME TIME

Norman pushes Russell up the stairs close to where Derek is

standing. He looks like he's about to collapse from exhaustion.

Norman lets go of the wheelchair and catches his breath. Derek

grabs the chair blocking Norman from view just as Aaron arrives.

Thank you, Derek, you're a life saver.

Hope it wasn't too much trouble.

No problem at all.

Aaron wheels Uncle Russell inside.

How are you doing, Uncle Russell?

39.

Terrible.

Derek follows, leaving Norman standing there out of breath.

Can I get a little help?

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Aaron enters and nods to Reverend Davis, who stands at the

front.

REVEREND.DAVIS

Ladies and gentlemen, could you all

kindly take your seats? We're about

to begin the service.

Ryan helps Martina to her seat. Jeff keeps an eye on Oscar.

Elaine grabs Oscar and drags him to a seat. Aaron wheels Uncle

Russell to his place.

Move! Move!

He pokes people with his cane. Aaron then takes his seat with

Michelle.

Oscar is not looking so good.

Ryan finally ends the conversation with Martina and heads to his

seat.

Reverend Davis is about to start, but waits as Norman, sweating,

pushes through the crowd to his seat. The reverend waits for

the disturbance to end, so Norman attracts the attention of

everyone. Norman takes his seat next to Derek. Derek leans

away.

You stink.

Family and friends, we're gathered

here today to mourn the passing of

Edward Barnes.

Yeah, well, you left me to push Uncle

Russell up that damn hill all by

myself. Then took all the credit.

40

Elaine, turns around.

Norman, shut up.

Elaine turns back around. Norman is irritated by this.

I'd like to start with a favorite

passage of Edwards from First Samuel

chapter 18, verses 1-4 in the King

James Bible.

"And it came to pass, when he had made

an end of speaking unto Saul, that the

soul of Jonathan was knit with the

soul of David, and Jonathan loved him

as his own soul. And Saul took him

that day, and would let him go no more

home to his father's house..."

While the reverend is talking, Norman pokes Elaine on the

shoulder and leans forward.

Hey, Elaine, I know you don't think

I'm part of the family--

'Cause you're not.

.but when you dissed me back there,

I had Uncle Russell in the car.

Aaron, disturbed by Norman's whispering, looks over.

You stole my parking space, and I had

to push him half a mile up a hill. We

almost missed the service!

Aaronlooks over again.

Look, Norman, if you poke me one more

time, I'm going to kick your ass.

41.

What the hell is going on?!

She stole my parking space!

(whispers to Norman)

Stole your parking space?!. My

father's dead! Act right.

Reverend Davis looks at them then continues her speech.

."Then Jonathan and David made a

covenant, because he loved him as his

own soul..."

As she speaks, Norman looks at his wrist, worried. The woman

sitting next to him smacks his wrist down.

ANGLE ON: Elaine looks at Jeff who watches Oscar. Oscar is

fidgeting and looking worried.

ANGLE ON: Aaron and Michelle. Aaron looks worried.

REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D)

."And Jonathan stripped himself of

the robe that was upon him, and gave

it to David, and his garments, even to

his sword and to his bow, and to his

girdle."

ANGLE ON: Oscar is laughing. Elaine tries to control him.

REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D)

And now we'll have a few words from

Edward's son, Aaron. Ryan's older

brother.

ANGLE ON: Aaron as he gathers himself. Michelle gives Aaron a

supportive squeeze of the arm. Aaron looks over and sees Frank

staring at him.

ANGLE ON: Uncle Russell.

Why isn't Ryan doing the eulogy? This

is bullshit.

42.

Aaron arrives at the front and looks out across the expectant

crowd. He's extremely nervous.

Good afternoon, everyone.

(his voice cracks)

Thank you for coming... I never

realized Dad was so popular. It looks

like he's got more friends now that

he's dead.

Blank faces stare back at Aaron. Cynthia looks pained.

Everyone is silent except for Oscar who laughs loudly. Elaine

silences him with a look. Aaron composes himself and pulls his

notes out.

My father was an exceptional man... He

was born in 1938. He grew up in

Alabama on a farm. He loved to take

long walks in the woods with his close

friend, Bobby. He told me how they

spent their summer days riding their

bikes through the fields and swimming

in the lake.

As Aaron speaks, Reverend Davis looks concerned because the

eulogy is so bad. She looks to Ryan who looks like "what can I

do?"

Jeff looks more concerned with Oscar, whose face is contorted

with pain. He looks like he's going to burst.

ANGLE ON: Aaron.

Dad's first job was working after

school as an assistant to an

electrician named Mr. Thompson. Back

then, Blacks weren't allowed to wear

rubber gloves. So my father got

shocked a lot. Because of that, he

had no feeling in his fingertips. I

asked my Dad what his first boss was

like...

The drugs have gotten the best of Oscar. He suddenly grabs

Elaine's arm. Aaron keeps talking.

Did you just see that?

43.

See what?

The coffin just moved.

What?

I'm telling you I saw it move.

Aaron becomes vaguely aware of the disturbance, but battles on

with his eulogy.

.He said he was a nice man, and

surprisingly well dressed. When Dad

was eighteen, he left home after an

argument with his father. He never

told me what that argument was about,

but I do know that after leaving South

Carolina, sadly he and Bob lost touch

and never saw each other again. Dad

went to college where he studied

accounting, a decision which lead to a

career in corporate finance... But

his real passion was for the arts,

with a particular fondness for

theatre, dance and musicals. He was a

charter member of the Negro Ensemble

Company and contributed regularly to

the Alvin Ailey School of Dance.

Oscar's protests are getting louder. Duncan looks back at the

disruption with a disapproving glare. Elaine looks at Jeff who

watches, concerned.

There, look. It happened again.

Oscar, please-

People start looking at Oscar, who's becoming increasingly

vocal, and looking increasingly like someone on acid.

That coffin's moving!

44.

Oscar. Just calm down.

Aaron looks over to Oscar.

The coffin's moving!

Michelle looks worried. Cynthia watches silently. Oscar jumps

up. Aaron stops the eulogy. Elaine is about to die from

embarrassment.

There's someone alive in there!

Oscar, please sit down.

Oscar ignores her and walks purposefully towards the coffin.

People watch him in astonishment, including Jeff.

What the hell is wrong with you

people?!

Oscar approaches the coffin as Aaron steps off the dais. Elaine

tries to hold Oscar back, but she can't.

Oscar, where are you going?

What are you doing?

There's someone moving in there.

Can't you see?

Oscar tries to open the coffin. Aaron and Elaine try to

restrain him, but can't. A tussle begins. Ryan jumps in to

help.

What the hell is wrong with you?!

Ryan, no!

45.

Elaine attempts to grab Ryan. Duncan stands up and tries to

help.

Get away from there!

No, I have to show you! He's alive!

He's alive!

The scene descends into absolute chaos with people pushing and

struggling. Finally, the coffin falls off the platform and tips

over.

The dead body of Edward rolls out onto the floor at the feet of

Cynthia. Cynthia screams.

Aaron freezes in shock. Michelle takes Cynthia through the

kitchen. The living room is left in chaos.

EXT. BACK GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER

Elaine drags Oscar out the back. Jeff follows.

INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Cynthia, in tears, enters accompanied by Aaron, Michelle and

Reverend Davis.

It's alright, Cynthia. It's alright.

She sits in a chair crying uncontrollably. Aaron is so angry,

he just marches out.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Some MEN grab the body and put it back in the coffin. Aaron

comes out of the kitchen and heads to the back yard. As they

put the coffin back on the stand, Ryan addresses the crowd.

Please let me extend my apologies to

you all. I understand the incident

you just witnessed was quite shocking,

but everything will be... returned...

to it's proper place. Please enjoy

the refreshments, and we'll call you

when we're ready to continue.

46.

It wouldn't have happened if Ryan had

done the eulogy.

Aaron exits through the garden door.

EXT. BACK GARDEN - DAY

Aaron storms out to Elaine who is trying to comfort Oscar. He's

looking very disturbed. Jeff is also there, looking guilty.

Elaine, what the hell was that?!

I'm so sorry, Aaron.

Oh, okay. My dead father's sprawled

out on the living room floor, but it's

okay, you're sorry.

But the coffin was moving.

Please, Aaron. Go back inside. I'll

explain later.

An annoyed and confused Aaron turns and walks back to the house.

He's almost to the door when Michelle arrives.

No, I haven't made the call about the

down payment yet.

I wasn't going to say that.

No I'm not going to have sex with you.

I wasn't going to say that.

What were you going to say?

47.

Hi.

He goes inside leaving Michelle standing there. Duncan comes

out and heads for Oscar.

I'll kill him!

Elaine tries to keep Duncan away from Oscar, who is stressed

enough and looks terrified.

Dad, leave it alone!

Leave it alone?! He just knocked my

brother-in-law out of his coffin.

It wasn't his fault.

Yes it was. My sister is in tears. I

can't believe you brought this idiot!

I don't ever want to see him again, do

you understand me?

I can't do that.

Why not?

Because we're... moving in together.

Duncan looks over at Oscar, who looks like he's just seen a

ghost. He's struggling to stand up straight, with Jeff who's

doing his best to look after him.

Are you crazy?

Dad, this isn't actually what he's

like. He took some drugs and--

Drugs?! Is he on the pipe?

48.

Jeff looks over, his eyes pleading with Elaine not to tell on

him.

No he's not on the pipe. He took some

Valium and had a.bad reaction.

Jeff looks grateful.

Valium?! That's not a Valium high.

Your mother was on Valium for forty

years. She never knocked over a

coffin.

Dad, please.

I just want to point out that you

won't see Derek knocking over a

coffin.

Not right now, Dad.

Fine. I've got to check on Cynthia,

but this isn't over.

Duncan walks back to the house. Elaine walks over to Oscar who

is hugging a tree.

Oscar.

Elaine.

Come and sit down.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Aaron talks to a mourner. Norman comes up and hugs him.

Are you alright?... That was insane.

He just fell out the coffin like a

dead fish. I guess its not much of a

metaphor when you're talking about a

dead human, but--

Death at a Funeral 02/6/0.9 49.

Aaron looks at Norman.

Norman, please.

Oh yeah... Sorry. It's just that you

never know when it's your time. Like,

I have this weird thing on my wrist.

I've had it for a few weeks now. I

don't know what it is--

Why don't you show it to my Uncle

Duncan? He's a doctor.

He is? Great. Thanks.

Norman walks off toward the kitchen. He passes Uncle Russell

and Ryan talking to Martina.

I read your last book, "Black Hurt."

Good, good. Thanks a lot.

I'm not giving you a compliment you

arrogant bastard. What a load of

bullshit. I wouldn't wipe my ass with

it.

Ryan leads Martina away from Uncle Russell.

EXT. BACK GARDEN - SITTING AREA - DAY

Oscar, Elaine and Jeff are standing together.

I swear it was moving. I must be

losing my mind...

(looks at his hands)

Why are my hands so big?!

Oscar, listen to me. I need to tell

you something...

Elaine sits him down on the bench.

50.

What is it?

Now... You remember I gave you some

Valium earlier?

Yes.

Well it turns out that it wasn't

actually Valium.

Oscar just looks at Elaine. Jeff slinks off into the

background.

Can you hear me?

Hello?

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Cynthia is being comforted by her friends and Duncan. Norman

enters and beckons Duncan over to the side.

Hello, Doctor, I know this is a bad

time, but I've got this thing on my

hand. I've had it for weeks now...

Duncan is looking at Norman incredulously.

What do you think it is?

Cynthia stands up.

Duncan, I'm going back now.

She exits. Reluctantly, Duncan answers Norman.

You should probably go see a

dermatologist.

He turns to follow his sister out, but Norman pulls him back.

51.

Really? Why? What do you think it

is?

I don't know. It looks like some kind

of pigment mutation.

Duncan walks further out of the room.

Pigment mutation?!

Duncan turns again.

You're probably just allergic to

something. Maybe from shellfish,

nuts...

Duncan heads further out of the room, but Norman won't give up.

Nuts? What kind of nuts?

Duncan turns around again.

I don't know. Pecans? Peanuts?...

Excuse me.

Duncan finally exits, leaving Norman looking shocked and

terrified.

A pigment mutation?

EXT. BACK GARDEN - SITTING AREA - DAY

Elaine is trying to explain to Oscar.

Do you understand? Hallucinogenic.

Oscar recoils. He turns to Jeff.

Yeah, now, the best thing to do is

relax and just go with the flow. Try

and enjoy it.

52.

Oscar stands up, panicked and grabs Jeff by the lapels. We see

the bottle of "Valium" falls out of his pocket.

You!

Oscar!

She tries to pull him off Jeff.

How long does it last?

I don't know... eight hours?

Eight hours?! Of this?!!

Oscar let go.

She pulls him off Jeff.

ANGLE ON: Derek watching from the window.

ANGLE ON: Derek smoothing his hair seeing his opportunity.

ANGLE ON: Oscar runs inside. Elaine follows with Jeff in tow.

They head into the house.

INT. BACK DOOR - DAY

Derek has been looking at Elaine outside and waiting for his

moment. Elaine comes rushing in following Oscar.

Oh, hi, Elaine. You following me?

She just runs right past, then Jeff rushes past following

Elaine. Oscar pushes through people.

Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

53.

Elaine grabs Oscar and leads him to the stairs.

Excuse me. He's going to be sick.

They head up the stairs with Jeff following.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY

Elaine rounds the corner and leads Oscar to the bathroom.

goes in and shuts the door behind him.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Oscar is building up quite a sweat and mumbling to himself. He

catches his reflection in the mirror and SCREAMS! Elaine opens

the door.

Oscar.

Oscar grabs the hair-dryer and wields it like a gun.

Stand back!

Oscar, put down the dryer.

Get back or I'll blow your head off.

Oscar backs Elaine out of the bathroom.

Oscar, please--

Oscar shuts the door and locks it.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Elaine is pressed against the door.

Oscar, are you okay?

She tries to open the door, but it's locked. Jeff walks up

checking his pockets.

Oscar, let me in.

54.

Jeff realizes he lost the pill bottle.

Oscar. Oscar?

Uh... Elaine... I can't find the pill

bottle?

But Elaine is too busy to hear.

Oscar! Open the door.

Jeff looks at the floor as he leaves.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

Oscar is talking to himself in the mirror.

Okay. Breathe.

It's going to be okay. Breathe.

You're and investment banker. You've

handled mergers for billion dollar

companies. You can do this. Dead

bodies don't move. They don't move.

But that body was moving. It was

moving.

Then he slaps himself.

Snap out of it! You can handle this.

You can do this.

He runs the tap and splashes some water on his face.

Alright. You're okay. Stay calm...

Stay calm...

Oscar is still staring at himself in the mirror.

That's it, Oscar, keep it together.

K.I.T. Keep it together. K.I.T.

Keep it together. Everything's going

to be fine. Nothing moved. Dead

people don't move. They're stiff.

They don't move, do they?

55

(he screams at himself in the

DO THEY!!!!

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR

Elaine has her ear pressed against the door. She hears the

scream.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

Easy now. Easy now. We can do this.

A few hours. That's nothing. No

sweat. I mean you've already been in

here for...

He looks at his watch.

Where's my watch?!

He sees it's on the other wrist.

Oh!

He checks the time.

It's already been...

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Elaine continues to knock on the door.

Open the door. Oscar.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

Oscar finally gets a read on his watch.

Five minutes.

Suddenly the pressure of. the situation overtakes him.

God damn! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

56.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS'- SAME TIME

As the screaming and cursing goes on upstairs, Aaron approaches

a mourner who looks concerned.

OSCAR (O.S.)

Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

It's alright.

Aaron turns around not knowing what to do.

FRANK (O.S.)

Grief does strange things to people.

Aaron looks at him a little freaked out by his sudden

appearance.

I guess so.

If you remember, I have something to

talk to you about.

Oh yeah.

Is there somewhere private we could

go?

Sure.

They walk away. The screaming continues as Jeff, frantically,

but slowly comes down the stairs re-tracing his steps and

searching around for his lost bottle of pills.

INT. STUDY - DAY

Frank and Aaron enter. Frank looks around the room a little

grief stricken himself. Aaron walks to the desk as Frank

touches some mementoes he clearly remembers.

Frank takes out his glasses and notices a manuscript on the desk

with Aaron's name.

Are you writing a novel?

57.

Uh... yeah.

Aaron takes the manuscript and moves it away.

Like your big brother.

Actually I'm the oldest. I was

writing before.he was. I've had a few

pieces published in the New Yorker.

But now I'm mainly teaching.

Oh. Well, you must be very proud of

your brother then. Getting all his

novels published.

Aaron decides to move the conversation on.

So anyway. What did you want to talk

about?

He motions for Frank to take a seat and sits across from him.

Your father and I were very... close.

Yeah. Okay. That's good.

And we spent a lot of time together.

Yeah, well Dad was a fun guy.

Frank takes an envelope out of his inside jacket pocket and

takes some photos from the envelope.

Um... I've got some photos I want to

show you.

Sure.

Frank passes the first photo.

58.

That's me and your Dad in Central Park

in New York.

Aaron looks at the photo curiously.

That's us on Santa Monica Boulevard on

Halloween...

Aaron takes the next one, becoming more suspicious.

So, where did you and my dad meet?

Just around.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY

Elaine is outside the bathroom banging on the door. We can

still hear Oscar moaning inside.

Oscar. Are you alright?

INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

Oscar is laying in the bathtub. He has his head under the

faucet with his mouth open. A drip falls into his mouth.

Ahhh.

He smacks his lips together and then opens his mouth and waits

for the next drop.

INT. STUDY - DAY

Aaron is sitting with Frank. Frank passes him another photo.

That's one of me and your father going

to the premiere of "Dreamgirls". I

was dressed as Deena and your father

had to be Effie.

Aaron looks at the photo of them dressed in drag.

59.

So... I mean you have all these

pictures, but he never said anything

about you. This is the first I'm

Frank gives Aaron a knowing look.

How did you know my father?

Aaron looks around the room. There is a copy of "People

Magazine" sexiest men issue on the table. He sees figurines of

male ballet dancers. It's getting clearer. He sees three

Robert Mapplethorpe photos on the wall. There's a signed Kathy

Griffin 8x10. Frank looks around waiting for him to get it.

Aaron looks at a framed movie poster for Australia with Hugh

Jackman. Aaron looks back at the picture. He gets it.

Oh God...

Aaron jumps up and closes the study door.

Are you really that shocked?

Frank gestures around the room.

I had no idea.

I'm sorry. I'm sure he would have

eventually told you, but I guess he

wasn't sure how you'd react.

Aaron shakes in disgust.

Uugg. Like this.

Aaron gathers his senses. He has a thought and turns to Frank.

Does my mother know?

No. And there's no reason why she

should... Just as long as I get

what's owed to me.

60.

A long pause. Aaron looks over at Frank.

"What's owed to you"?

FRANK .

Well, obviously I should get

something... I mean, your dad and I

were lovers, and he left me absolutely

nothing in his will. How do you think

that makes me feel?

Aaron fails to respond, because he's in too much shock.

I'll tell you how it makes me feel

cheap. Like some cheap piece of

ass... I mean, I'm entitled to

something.

What do you want?

What I want is a lot, but I'm not

asking you for what I want. I deserve

thirty thousand dollars.

Thirty thousand dollars?! I can't

just give you thirty thousand dollars.

My wife and I are trying to have kids--

Your father told me you were having

trouble...

Look, your father promised to take

care of me, and I made sacrifices to

keep him happy.

Aaron gets angry.

You think you can come in here,

slander my father's name and show me a

few photos of you and my dad dressed

up going to see "Dreamgirls"? I saw

"Dreamgirls" twice. I'm not gay.

That's not proof of anything...

"Steppin' to the bad side / Gonna take

a mean ride."

61.

Aaron grabs Frank and pushes him against the wall.

I'm not giving you anything but a--

Frank pulls out another photo and holds it up to Aaron's face.

Aaron,releases Frank and snatches the picture.

Now I don't want to, but I will show

these photos to your mother... Do you

really want me to do that today?

Wait here.

He exits the study.

INT. ENTRY CORRIDOR - DAY

Aaron closes the study door behind him and almost bumps into two

male mourners.

MIDDLE AGED MAN

Aaron, I was just telling George here

how when we were boys together your

dad used to love to make us all go

skinny dipping.

Aaron just stares at them. Then he moves toward the living

room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - BUFFET - DAY

Aaron crosses the living room which is full of people mingling

around. He's gone pale.

Oh God, oh God, oh God...

He's looking around for Ryan, but there's no sign-. -Michelle

watches Aaron walk around the room.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR SAME TIME

Elaine is banging on the bathroom door.

Oscar. Open the door.

Derek arrives behind her and leans in close.

62.

Anything I can do to help?

Not really, thanks.

Derek moves over to face her and leans his arm on the door very

coolly.

I guess you've got it under control.

Elaine ignores him and continues banging on the door.

Oscar?

Anguished noises emanate from the bathroom.

Oscar! Open the door.

So what are you doing after the

funeral? I've got Maxwell tickets.

Look... I'm busy. I don't have time

for your shit. Now get the hell away

from me!

Derek looks hurt and storms off.

Oscar!

INT. BACK OF KITCHEN - DAY

Ryan is talking to Martina.

.so you've never been to New York?

I've been with my parents once.

Oh, that's not really seeing New York.

You have to come visit me. When's

your birthday?

63.

I turn eighteen next month.

Great. All star weekend is in New

York this year.

I know. I know.

Aaron approaches.

Ryan, I need to talk to you.

Not now, Aaron.

It's important.

Give me five minutes.

Aaron pulls him away.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

Aaron pulls Ryan into the garage and closes the door.

What are you doing? What is it?

Aaron lowers his voice.

That guy that was here before, that we

didn't recognize...

The guy in the leather jacket?

Yeah.

What about him?

Aaron lowers his voice further.

64

Well, I was just with him in the

study, and... and he showed me some

pictures...

So? He showed you some picture?

What's wrong with that? I'm busy...

Pictures of him and Dad together at

the premiere of "Dreamgirls".

Ryan's face is blank. It's not registering.

Look, is this going anywhere, Aaron?

Ryan, he was Dad's lover!

What? No, no, no.

The guy in the leather jacket just

showed me pictures of him and Dad

together.

No, no, no. I don't believe that. My

father is not gay. I've known him my

whole life. And he's the most non-gay

man I've ever met. Matter fact, he's

so straight he makes me seem gay. And

I know I'm not gay--

Aaron pulls out the picture.

Uugg.

Uugg. I know.

Uugg/Uugg.

Aaron nods.

65.

INT. DINING AREA - SAME TIME

his wrist.

How can she be more interested in that

idiot than me? Women. They don't

know what they want!

Norman's still examining his arm.

It sounds serious, doesn't it?

What?

A pigment mutation.

Derek gives Norman a disparaging look. Norman picks up some

cake and takes a bite.

Ooh, will you try this cake? I think

it might have nuts in it.

So?

(shows his wrist)

So?... Aaron's uncle says I might be

allergic to nuts...

Then don't eat nuts. Put the cake

down.

I can't not eat the cake. That's what

I do when I'm stressed. I eat cake.

I bet you won't eat it when your arm

falls off.

Norman sniffs the cake.

66.

Will you just try it and tell me if

there's nuts in it?

No.

Come on.

I don't want to.

Just do me a favor--

Norman is pushing the cake towards Derek's mouth.

Get away from me.

Derek gets up and walks off, leaving Norman spitting out the

cake.

From under the table, Jeff pops up.

You haven't seen a pill bottle around,

have you? A Valium pill bottle?

No. But can you try this--

Jeff smiles nervously and goes back to his search on the floor.

Jeff slides across the floor past Uncle Russell sitting at the

other end of the table. An OLDER LADY turns to Russell.

Edward and I watched the Tony Awards

every year. We would get all dressed

up and sip cocktails. I'm going to

miss him so much.

Don't worry. The way you look, you

won't be far behind.

The mourner looks shocked. Jeff continues his search along the

floor.

67.

EXT. BACK GARDEN - SITTING AREA - DAY

Cynthia is sitting quietly with Duncan.

I'm sure we'll start soon.

He looks toward the house and sees Norman exit. Duncan wants to

avoid him.

Let's go inside.

In a moment.

Duncan gets up and heads toward the house. He passes Norman.

Doctor, I just have a--

Duncan doesn't stop, leaving Norman holding his wrist. Norman

looks over and sees Cynthia. He sits next to her.

I'm sorry... you know... about... you

know...

Thank you. I'll be alright. I know

he's watching over me.

You think so?' I mean, there are a lot

of fine ones up in heaven. Anna

Nicole Smith's dead too, you know.

might be watching over her.

Norman sits next to Cynthia.

Death is a terrible thing... Did you

check to make sure he.was wearing

shoes? I hear they steal the shoes.

And I hope you took off his ring,

'cause if it's worth anything, someone

is going to take that, too.

Cynthia stares at Norman.

68.

Before he died, did he have a rash?

She gets up and exits. Norman notices Jeff's pill bottle on the

ground. He picks it up and puts it in his pocket.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

The camera closes in on the closed garage door. We hear hushed

voices.

INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

You don't understand. If we don't

give him the money, he's going to show

Mom the picture.

Okay. Let me think, let me think.

Ryan is trying to come up with a solution.

I think you should pay him the money.

What do you mean, you think I should

pay him the money? Where the hell is

all your money?

I'm in debt up to my ass. I'm broke,

man!

So after paying for the funeral, the

clothes, the catering... Now I'm

supposed to shell out thirty thousand

dollars? He's your father, too.

You're the oldest. Besides, you've

been living off Mom and Dad long

enough. You must have some money

saved. You haven't paid rent in two

years.

I have not been living off of them...

I've been living with them.

69.

No I haven't paid rent, but Dad hasn't

worked in five years. Who do you

think has been paying all the bills?

Well if you've got money problems and

I've got money problems, what can we

do? Fuck him!

Aaron shows Ryan the photo again.

You've got to pay him.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

Oscar is sitting on the toilet unrolling the toilet paper.

Yes, yes. Keep coming. Join the

others. Join the others.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Elaine leans against the door.

Oscar?

Oscar?

Oscar?

She tries the door. It's still locked.

Oscar?

OSCAR (O.S.)

Oscar?

Oscar.

OSCAR (O.S.)

Oscar.

Os...

70.

OSCAR (O.S.)

.car.

EXT. BACK GARDEN - SITTING AREA - SAME TIME

Jeff frantically searches the bushes where Oscar pushed him,

looking for the pill bottle. He finds nothing.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Uncle Russell is creating havoc at the buffet table. He's

pushing people aside and poking them with his cane.

Are you alright?

No, my nephew is dead and these

bastards ate all the potato salad.

Nearby mourners look appalled. The reverend looks over and sees

Aaron and Ryan coming down the kitchen corridor. She approaches

them.

INT. KITCHEN CORRIDOR - DAY

Reverend Davis appears in front of Aaron and Ryan.

Ah! I think we're just about ready to

start the service, so-

Would you mind giving us five minutes?

Of course.

Thanks.

Aaron walks off followed by Ryan. He passes Michelle, who's

sitting on the couch. She stands up.

Is everything okay?

No. I'm really sorry, honey, but

buying a condo is going to have to be

put on hold, just for now.

71.

What are you talking about? Why?

Babe, you know I wouldn't do this

unless I had a good reason.

What's the reason?

I haven't got time right now, please.

I'll explain later.

Aaron walks off to join Ryan, who's at the door of the study.

INT. STUDY - DAY

Frank is reading Aaron's manuscript. Ryan and Aaron enter.

You? So you and my--. You?! It's

you. So when I called my father and

he didn't answer, he was with you?!

Aaron realizes what Frank is reading.

Hey, hey, hey!

Aaron rushes over and takes the manuscript away from Frank.

What are you doing with my

manuscript?! It's not ready.

He puts it in the desk.

Well, you left it on a coffee table.

What's that supposed to mean?

Well, when you put things on coffee

tables, it's assumed it's for

everybody.

72.

It kind of is...

Can we get to the point here?

Fine by me.

Aaron is now extremely irritated. He exchanges a look with Ryan

confirming that there's no other way out.

If I write this check, then that's it.

You give us the photos and stay away

from our mother. Deal?

Deal.

Aaron sits down at the desk and reluctantly takes out his check

book. He starts writing.

Is it your first one?

Aaron stops writing and looks up at him.

What?

The novel... it's a first draft?

Yeah. So?

No, nothing.

Aaron continues to write the check.

I tried writing once... Didn't work

for me, either. I think it's just a

gift. You either have it or you

don't... It must be hard for you

though, especially since your younger

brother is such a great writer.

73

Your father and I read "Black Hurt"

together. Truly amazing. We loved

it. He was so proud of you.

Thanks... I guess...

Aaron rips the check into little pieces.

That's it. I can't do it.

Aaron, what are you doing?

There's no way in the world I'm giving

him my hard earned money.

Don't be stupid. Not today. I'll pay

you back as soon as my money comes in.

He comes in today! Of all days, he

picks the day of my father's funeral!

Who the hell is he?

He has the pictures!

So what. Who cares what he's got.

Let him show the world. Put it on

facebook. I don't care.

Let's just get it over with.

There's a long pause as everyone seems to be deciding what to

do. Finally, Frank stands up.

Fine. This is on your head.

Frank heads towards the door.

What? No, wait.

74.

Ryan rushes to stand in front of the door, blocking Frank's

Get out of my way.

Let's just discuss this a minute.

There's nothing to discuss.

Frank grabs the door and tries to open it.

Get out of my way.

He tries to push past, but Ryan covers his mouth, muffling his

cries.

Get out of my way. Move!

Ryan restrains Frank.

INT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME

A few mourners hear the commotion and the muffled voices. They

turn to look.

INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Ryan grabs Frank and wrestles him to the ground. Aaron watches,

absolutely shocked as Ryan and Frank roll around on the floor.

Aaron jumps up and stands between them and the door.

Ryan, what are you doing?

Get off me!

Ryan is trying to muffle Frank's screams.

Aaron, help me!

Ryan is holding Frank down and trying to keep him quiet.

Ah!!

75.

Aaron, you got any rope or duct tape?

What?! I'm not a serial killer. I

don't keep rope and duct tape in my

pocket.

Well just grab something!

(indicating with his head)

There, from the curtains.

Aaron grabs the cord that's tied around the curtains. He holds

it over the wrestling duo, but Ryan's hands are occupied with

Frank.

Tie his legs.

Aaron grabs his legs and in doing so falls on top of Frank as

well. As he wraps the curtain cord around Frank's legs...

This is a really bad idea.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY

Elaine leans against the wall listening as Oscar hums in the

bathroom. She slides down the wall and sits on the floor.

EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW - SAME TIME

From a rooftop POV we see the window slide open and Oscar,

dripping with sweat and not wearing a shirt, lean out. He takes

a deep breath of fresh air and listens to the birds.

He climbs out the window revealing he's completely naked. He

stands on-the roof and lifts his hands to the sky.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Michelle comes up and sits next to Elaine.

Men.

Tell me about it... How's Aaron?

76.

How would I know? He's been avoiding

me all day. We're trying to get

pregnant. But I can't really do that

by myself, can I? I feel like I'm

making him eat brussel sprouts every

time we do it.

Elaine looks at her.

The guy's father just died. Don't you

think this is a bad day for sex?

Don't you think I know that?

I'm sorry. At least your husband

didn't ruin the funeral.

It's a funeral, it's already ruined.

When you start off with a dead guest

of honor, how much worse can it get?

INT. STUDY - DAY

Ryan and Aaron struggle with Frank, who's muffled cries are

starting to fade.

Get that tie.

Aaron grabs the necktie from off the desk.

What am I supposed to do with the tie?

Whatever you do with a tie.

I don't know what to--

Just stuff it in his mouth! Damn,

I have to do everything?

Apparently everything but write a damn

check.

77.

Suddenly the door opens and Norman enters.

Aaron, do you know what was in this

cake, I-

ANGLE ON: Frank who looks at Norman bug eyed hoping he'll help.

Shut the goddamn door!

Shocked, Norman does as he's told. It takes Norman a moment to

register that Aaron and Ryan are sitting on top of Frank.

Frank continues screaming through the cloth.

What is going on? Who is that guy?

Ryan thinks quickly.

He's having a seizure.

I just found some Valium outside.

Would that help?

Yeah. Great. Give him some.

Frank shakes his head "no." Norman gets on his knees with the

guys and opens the bottle.

It's okay. This should help. calm you

down.

Frank tries to protest, but can't. Ryan holds Frank's mouth

open as Aaron holds his nose closed. Norman pours a few pills

into Frank's mouth, then Ryan holds Frank's mouth shut.

Suddenly the door opens again and Jeff walks in.

Have you seen a little brown pill

bottle lying around--

They all turn to Jeff. Frank looks at him, hoping this time

he'll get saved.

78

Norman! I told you to lock the damn

door.

You said "shut the damn door."

Jeff locks the door and looks shocked.

What's going on?

He's having a seizure.

Why is he all tied up?

No one knows what to say.

EXT. ROOF - SAME TIME

Oscar stands on the roof, naked, breathing in the fresh air.

INT. STUDY - DAY

Jeff, Aaron, Ryan and Norman are all kneeling over Frank.

He's blackmailing you? Over what?

If I could tell everybody, it wouldn't

be blackmail.

Look, just trust us. He's the bad

guy. We'll explain later.

What are you going to do with him?

Everyonerealizes they have no answer to this question.

Yeah, Ryan, what are we going to do

with him?

Ryan doesn't have any answers.

I don't know.

79.

You don't know?! Come on, you're the

big writer. You're the one who came

up with "Black Hurt." Dream up

something where we all live happily

ever after. We can't keep him tied up

forever. How long do you think those

Valium are going to last?

Valium?

Yeah, I found that bottle of Valium.

We gave him a few to calm him down.

Norman hands him the bottle.

Ah shit!

Jeff stands up and heads over to the door.

What?

What?

They all head over to Jeff.

Frank looks extremely curious to know what's going on. Everyone

talks very quietly so that Frank can't hear.

What is it?

The thing is... those pills aren't

really Valium. It's acid and... acid.

What?!

Oscar took one by mistake. That's why

he's acting crazy.

Jeff, what the hell are you doing with

this stuff?

80.

A friend left them at my place.

What friend, Amy Winehouse?

Wait, you're telling us that Elaine's

boyfriend, who knocked over our

father's coffin, had just one of these

things...

And you gave him how many?

Norman looks a bit guilty.

Five.

Five?!

(looking at Frank)

Poor bastard.

I thought they were Valium.

They all turn and look at Frank who is looking back at them,

increasingly concerned by whatever conversation they are having,

and the pitying expressions on their faces.

Maybe we should call an ambulance.

You can't do that. I'll go to jail.

He's right. If anyone finds out this

guy's been force fed acid, we could

all be arrested.

So what then? What's going to happen?

Is he going to die?!

No... I don't think so... I doubt

it.. Probably not...

81.

knock.

Ryan?

EXT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME

Cynthia is knocking on the door.

Aaron?

INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

They all back away from the door.

CYNTHIA (O.S.

Are you in there?

They look at each other in panic.

Damn.

(as normal as possible)

Be out in a minute, Mom.

Ryan looks at Norman and Jeff.

(to Norman and Jeff)

Okay. We have to go out there. You

two stay in here and watch him.

Ryan closes the curtains.

Watch him?! What do you mean, "watch

him"?

Just make sure he doesn't escape.

Lock the door behind us. We'll deal

with him after the funeral.

Aaron and Ryan open the study door leaving Norman and Jeff to

take care of Frank.

82.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Aaron and Ryan come outside trying to look as normal as

possible. They see Cynthia standing with the reverend.

AARON .

How's it going, Mom?

Reverend Davis wants to talk with you.

INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Norman locks the door behind them.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Reverend Davis tries to remain cool, but she's agitated.

Lookie here, brother. I've been

patient. We all know it's a virtue,

but I'm about done with patience. Now

if we don't resume service soon, we're

going to need to have a little

conversation about my compensation.

Sure. So sorry. Um... can you just

give us another five minutes?

The reverend doesn't look too pleased.

Five minutes.

Is everything okay, boys?

Ryan and Aaron kiss their mother and walk off.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

Aaron and Ryan enter and slam the door.

Why didn't you just pay him the

money?!

Why did you tie him up?!

83.

Do you want Mom to find out?!

What is wrong with you?

They start to argue.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

We hear their muffled argument through the door. Uncle Russell

rolls up to Derek who is sitting at the kitchen table.

What's your problem?!

Women are my problem.

No such thing as having a woman

without a problem. If they didn't

have problems, do you think they'd let

us touch 'em? Let me tell you

something about women. Smarter than

you think they are. But not as smart

as they think they are.

She acts like she doesn't care that I

exist. I mean how can she not feel

what I feel?

Oh she feels it. She's playing hard

to get. She wants you to work for it.

Look, let me tell something about

women. They want a man who can

control them. I know they talk all

this Oprah, Beyonce "single women" BS,

but what they really want is an old

school man.

Really?

Listen here, boy. This is what you

do: you walk up to her, slap her--

84.

Slap her? You want me to hit her?

Has not hitting her worked? Look,

then you grab her and kiss her. The

harder the better.

Are you sure, 'cause that--

Oh, man, I gotta shit. Where's the

can?

He rolls away quickly.

INT. STUDY - DAY

Norman and Jeff are sitting in the study. Frank is on the floor

tied up, breathing heavily and making gurgling sounds.

I can't believe you gave him five.

Even if they were Valium, that's too

many. I wouldn't give a guy five

cough drops.

Suddenly they hear the doorknob rattle. Norman and Jeff both

look terrified.

Hello?

Jeff covers his mouth.

UNCLE RUSSELL (O.S.)

Hello?!

Neither Norman nor Jeff want to speak. They argue in gestures.

Finally Jeff relents.

Hello?

UNCLE RUSSELL (O.S.)

I need the toilet.

Jeff and Norman both look panicked. Norman goes to the door.

85.

Can't you use the one upstairs?

UNCLE RUSSELL (O.S.)

I'm in a wheelchair, you idiot! How

am I supposed to get up the stairs?!

Hello?

Norman and Jeff look at each other not knowing what to do.

UNCLE RUSSELL (O.S.)

Open the damn door!

Uncle Russell starts banging on the door with his cane.

What are we going to do?

They look at Frank who's starting to look high as a kite.

We'll stick him behind the couch.

Just looking for the key.

They pick Frank up and dump him behind the couch.

Jeff stays with Frank to keep him quiet as Norman opens the

door. Uncle Russell wheels himself inside.

What the hell is wrong with you

people? I'm about to take a dump in

my pants!

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY

Elaine is still standing outside the bathroom.

Derek comes up to talk to her. Elaine's completely drained and

stressed.

What do you want, Derek?

I just want to talk.

86.

Please don't make me go through this

again.

The only reason you don't want to go

out with me is because your dad likes

me.

No. The reason I don't want to go out

with you is because it was a mistake.

I was drunk off my ass. You could

have been a donkey.

Thanks.

That wasn't a compliment. I'm saying

I couldn't remember it.

Well I remember every minute of it.

A minute, huh? That's why I don't

remember.

What is it about this guy? What has

he got that I haven't got?

Okay, well for one thing, he's

responsible. He's caring. He's

considerate. He's thoughtful. He's

stable. He's--

EXT. ROOF - DAY

Oscar is leaning over the ledge playing with his spit and

laughing uncontrollably.

INT. GARAGE DAY

Aaron and Ryan are still arguing.

I'm not the one who tied him up.

87.

Well somebody had to look out for Mom.

I've been looking out for Mom since

you got your book deal.

You just can't get over it, can you?

You're burning with jealousy because I

left and did what you always wanted to

do.

I couldn't leave because I had

responsibilities.

Don't put it off on responsibilities.

You spent three years on a novel and

you won't even let anyone see it!

What are you going to do? Wait until

you're dead? You think you're going

to be the Tupac of books?

At least I'm not some hack writing

crap. Mr. "Mama's Secret", Mr. "Black

Hurt."

Mr. "Out of Ink", Mr. "Blank Page." At

least my crap gets published.

Michelle enters.

Aaron, what is going on?

Michelle, please, not now.

Why are you acting like this? Fine.

We don't have to have sex today, but

the condo? Don't you want to get out

of here?

88.

Just tell her, Aaron.

Tell me what?

Aaron closes the garage door.

Listen... Do you remember the guy in

the leather jacket?

Yeah.

Well, I don't know how to say this,

but... it looks like he and my father

were having sex.

What? No. Not your father. With

him?

Yes.

No. Your father was the straightest

guy I know.

That's what I thought.

Are you sure?

And now he wants thirty thousand

dollars or he's going to show everyone

photos of them doing... stuff...

Stuff like what?

Aaron and Ryan share a look. Aaron shows Michelle the picture.

She reacts.

INT. STUDY BATHROOM - DAY

Norman lifts Uncle Russell out of the chair.

89.

Hurry up!

Norman is struggling to hold Uncle Russell up.

UNCLE RUSSELL (CONT'D)

Have you got me?

Yes, I've got you.

Come on, quick, quick, quick.

Alright, I'm trying to see where the

toilet is.

He maneuvers Uncle Russell to the toilet.

Pants down. Pants down.

No you do it.

How can I do it? I'm handicapped.

Norman reluctantly helps Uncle Russell pull his pants down.

Alright. Alright.

Drawers. Drawers. Take down my

drawers.

Who calls them "drawers"?

Norman pulls them down.

It's all down.

Am I there? Am I there?

Norman looks and sees Uncle Russell is right over the toilet.

90.

Yes, yes. Just sit down.

Uncle Russell sits down on the toilet trapping Norman's hand

underneath and lets loose.

Ooh, that's better.

Norman pulls his hand out and looks at it in shock.

ANGLE ON: Norman's hand has shit on the fingers. He starts

freaking out and screaming.

INT. STUDY - DAY

Jeff hears Norman and jumps up.

NORMAN (O.S.)

Ahh!!!

Jeff goes into the bathroom to see what's going on.

INT. STUDY BATHROOM - DAY

Jeff opens the door and rushes in, but is stopped in his tracks

by Norman's shitty hand.

Ahh!!!

Ugh!

Norman, panicking, rushes to the sink, turns on the faucet full

blast and sticks his hand under the water. This causes a great

splashing.

INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Frank peeks up from behind the couch. He's clearly high. With

his hands still tied, he struggles to get to his feet.

INT. STUDY BATHROOM - DAY

Norman frantically washes his hands.

Norman? Norman?

Norman still has his face down.

91

Please, please. Just come off.

Norman!

Norman turns and we see he has shit splattered on his face.

What?

Jeff points to his face.

You missed some.

Norman turns slowly and looks in the mirror. He freaks out.

Oh, I think I've got some of it in my

mouth!

Norman desperately rushes to wash it off.

INT. STUDY - DAY

Frank is now up on his feet and running around like a rabid

animal.

INT. STUDY BATHROOM - SAME TIME

Jeff pulls Norman up and shakes him.

Pull yourself together. Would you

rather get caught or have shit in your

mouth?!

Uncle Russell has fallen asleep on the toilet.

INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Frank is running around the room. Through the door, we see

Uncle Russell sleeping on the toilet.

Frank jumps up and down on the sofa. He loses his balance and

falls on the coffee table head first. He cracks his head on the

corner and falls straight down.

Jeff and Norman rush out of the bathroom to find Frank lying on

the floor motionless, blood on his head.

92.

Oh, no. Check him. Check him.

Hey, man, you alright?

No response.

Check him again. Check him.

Man. Hey. Hey!

Wake him up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake

up.

What's his name?

I don't know. Try Larry.

Jeff looks at Norman, but he doesn't have a better idea.

Larry?

Shake him.

Jeff bends down and shakes him.

Larry, wake up. It's time to get up.

From the bathroom, Uncle Russell starts to stir. Norman quickly

closes the door.

Maybe it's not Larry. Try something

else. Pinch him.

Jeff pinches Frank. Still no response.

He must be breathing. He has to be

breathing. Please God let him be

breathing.

93.

Jeff looks concerned. He checks for a pulse. He looks up at

Norman with an expression that tells us all we need to know.

He's dead.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Michelle walks into frame and stops at the coffin. Aaron and.

Ryan stand on either side of her.

So that's it? We're just giving him

all the money we've saved?

Well, it's not that simple.

Why not?

Aaron refused to pay.

How come you couldn't pay, Ryan?

That's not the point. Besides, the

only reason Aaron tore up the check is

because the guy started talking bad

about his novel.

Your novel?

Michelle looks confused.

You let him read your novel? You

wouldn't let me read your novel. Are

you screwing him, too? 'Cause Lord

knows you're not screwing me.

INT.HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Norman comes out of the study and closes the door behindhim.

He leans against the door, dripping with sweat.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Aaron and Ryan look over and see Norman.

94.

ANGLE ON: Norman as he pastes a maniacal grin on his face and

crosses into the living room. As he moves through the throng of

mourners, they are all unnerved by him.

Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Pardon me. Hi.

The hugesmile never leaves his face.

ANGLE ON: Ryan, Aaron and Michelle watching Norman, concerned.

Norman approaches and stands on the other side of the coffin.

Norman, why are you grinning like

that?

(to Aaron and Ryan)

Can you come to the study for a

second?

Aaron can see from Norman's face, and the sweat on his forehead,

that something serious has happened. Then he sees Cynthia

sitting in the corner.

I'll be back soon. Can you check on

Mom?

Sure.

They exit. Michelle crosses to Cynthia.

Hey, are you doing okay? It's going

to be alright.

If you've never given life, child, how

can you understand death?

INT. STUDY - DAY

Jeff is leaning on the window. There's a knock at the door.

AARON (O.S.)

It's Aaron.

Jeff opens the door. Norman, Ryan and Aaron enter. Norman

locks the door behind them. Aaron rushes over to the body.

95

Oh shit! Call an ambulance.

There's no point.

What do you mean "there's no point"?!

Look at him! He's dead!

Dead, dead?

Is there a "kind of" dead, Aaron?

What the hell did you do to him?

We didn't do anything!

Well he was alive when I left.

He hit his head on the table.

Oh no. This is really bad. This is

really, really bad.

What are we going to do?

Twenty-five to life.

Norman looks at his watch.

You know what, I really have to be

Norman makes his way to the door.

You're not going anywhere.

96.

Look, I'm not the prison type.

They'll kill me. Oh my God, I'm going

to die. I'm going to die in prison.

Oh my God, do you know how fast a rash

spreads in prison?

Aaron smacks Norman.

Pull yourself together!

Norman calms down.

Thanks, man.

After a beat, Ryan speaks.

Look, no one here knows who this guy

is. Nobody knows his name. They

probably didn't even notice him.

Didn't notice him? He's four fucking

feet tall.

Look, all we have to do is get rid of

the body. It'll be like he came and

left.

Get rid of the body?! It took me two

months to get rid of a couch.

Did any of you happen to notice the

size of Uncle Edward's coffin?

Everyone looks at Jeff.

You want to bury him with my father?

Why not?... I mean it's not like he's

going to know.

97.

That's not the point.

You have to admit, it makes sense,

Aaron. The coffin's there, the hole

in the ground's there... He'll be

gone, finished, end of story...

Unless you have a better suggestion.

Aaron desperately tries to think of an alternative.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY

Derek and Elaine are sitting in the corridor. Elaine looks

drained of energy. Derek's smoking a cigarette.

It's funny. No matter what you say,

I'm convinced we'll be together.

Yeah, well, we all make mistakes... I

used to be convinced I was going to

marry Prince. What happened there?

You still could.

You're an idiot.

I'm serious. You only live once. You

might as well do whatever it is that

makes you happy.

Yes, but maybe I don't think of life

anymore as all about me, me, me.

Maybe I've discovered there's

something outside of myself that I

care about. And maybe you should,

too.

Derek looks hurt.

That's kind of cold. I care about

you.

98.

No, Derek, you care about you. You

only care about me in relation to how

I affect you. There's a difference.

That's not true, Elaine.

EXT. ROOF - SAME TIME

Oscar is squatting down rolling his head around when he hears

Elaine's voice.

ELAINE (O.S.)

Derek, get over yourself.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Elaine moves over to the window. Derek follows her.

Hey!

He slaps her on the butt. Elaine whirls around. Derek grabs

her on the arms.

I'm the man for you, and you're coming

home with me.

He kisses her.

EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Oscar turns to look at the window and sees Derek and Elaine

kissing.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - LATER

Elaine pulls away and punches Derek in the face. He staggers

back and sees Oscar in the window.

What is that?!

Elaine turns around.

Oscar!

99.

EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Oscar moves away from the window and further out on the ledge.

Elaine opens the window and sticks her head out.

Oscar! What are you doing? Get back

here and put your clothes on right

now!

I saw you kissing him.

I wasn't kissing him. I swear.

Please, baby, put your clothes on.

We're at a funeral!

Derek sticks his head out the window behind Elaine.

You cheater! You cheater! You're

committing adultery!!!

Calm down.

I'm going to jump right now.

Remember you've got drugs in you.

This isn't really happening. Oscar,

look at me.

She turns to Derek.

Get out of here!

She pushes him back inside.

EXT. BACK GARDEN - SAME TIME

As mourners mill about the lawn we hear:

OSCAR (O.S.)

I'm going to jump. I'm jumping.

You're a cheater!

100.

People gather. around and look up. We only see Oscar from the

waist up.

ANGLE ON: Oscar.

I'm going to jump. She's cheating on

me!

ELAINE (O.S.)

Oscar, please. Come back here.

INT. STUDY - DAY

Ryan, Aaron, Jeff and Norman are as we left them.

There's just no way we can do it.

It's impossible.

Suddenly there's a knock on the door. Everyone freezes.

DEREK (O.S.)

Norman, it's Derek. Let me in.

Everyone freezes.

Oh shit. Put him in the bathroom.

Aaron and Jeff drag Frank to the bathroom door.

DEREK (O.S.)

Are you in there?

Aaron opens the door and we see Uncle Russell still on the

toilet. He looks up.

What's that?

Aaron slams the door. We can hear Russell's muffled shouting

coming from behind the bathroom door.

Norman!! Why is Uncle Russell on the

toilet?

I forgot!

101.

How could you forget?! What the hell

is wrong with you?!

Another loud bang on the door.

DEREK (O.S.)

Aaron, open the door.

Norman opens the door as Aaron runs over to keep Derek from

entering.

INT. STUDY/CORRIDOR - DAY

Aaron opens the door an inch.

What is it?

Aaron, where's Norman?

(from behind the door)

I'm here.

It's Oscar, he went crazy. He's--

Derek realizes that something weird's going on.

What's going on?

Nothing.

Derek puts aside his curiosity for the time being.

Look, Oscar's on the roof stark naked.

He saw me kissing Elaine and now he's

threatening to jump!

I've got to go.

Jeff rushes to the door.

Where are you going?

102.

I have to go out there. If he jumps,

my sister is going to kill me.

Jeff rushes out.

(to Ryan and Norman)

Wait here.

Aaron follows Jeff, but he does not run. He walks out.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jeff rushes through the empty room. Aaron walks behind him

slowly.

EXT. BACK GARDEN DAY

Jeff runs through the kitchen door and joins the mourners

looking at Oscar on the roof.

Get back here. Be careful!

I believe I can fly! I believe I can

touch the sky!

ANGLE ON: Aaron who steps out and sees everybody watching Oscar.

EXT. ROOF - SAME TIME

Elaine is still leaning out the window.

Oscar, come inside. We'll have some

coffee.

No!

He climbs up on the roof.

Oscar!

She climbs out the window.

103.

EXT. BACK GARDEN - SAME TIME

The mourners see that Oscar is naked. He stumbles. Everybody

GASPS!

Aaron notices that everybody is captivated by the drama.

EXT. ROOF - SAME TIME

Elaine follows Oscar on the roof.

EXT. BACK GARDEN - SAME TIME

Duncan sees Elaine on the roof.

Elaine, what are you doing?!

Elaine sees Oscar climbing further up the roof.

Elaine!

Elaine follows Oscar.

Aaron realizes this is his chance. He heads back inside.

Michelle catches him at the door.

What are you doing?

I think I can get rid of this guy, but

I need you to stay out here and try to

stop anyone from coming in.

Okay. I'll do what I can.

She heads back to the crowd on the lawn. As Aaron goes through

the doorway of the kitchen, Derek passes him on the way out to

the lawn to see what's happening.

DUNCAN (O.S.)

Elaine!

INT. STUDY - DAY

Norman is standing in the corner. Aaron knocks on the door.

Who is it?

104.

AARON (O.S.)

It's Aaron!

Norman opens the door.

Everyone's out in the garden... We've

gotta move the body now.

Let's go!

Ryan and Aaron grab Frank. As Norman runs out.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Norman looks around and sees that it's clear. He goes back to

the study and opens the door.

Quick. Quick!

Aaron and Ryan carry Frank out as Norman looks around.

Make sure no one comes in.

As they disappear around the corner,, Norman closes the study

door. He turns just in time to find Reverend Davis approaching.

He intercepts.

(to Reverend Davis)

Hi!

The reverend looks around, not knowing why Norman is being so

especially friendly to her.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Ryan and Aaron hurry across the living room carrying Frank.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Norman is blocking Reverend Davis.

So, what made you decide to get your

God on?

105.

Look, I'm sorry, I really need to use

I'd like to make a confession.

I'm not a priest.

That's okay, 'cause I'm not Catholic.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Aaron and Ryan get to the coffin and Ryan opens it up.

There's an intense moment as they look down at their father in

the coffin. They both stop for a moment, speechless.

Aaron, we have to do this.

Aaron looks up at Ryan and nods his assent. Ryan and Aaron lift

up Frank and try their best to put him in the coffin.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Norman still blocks the reverend.

What do you think God's favorite color

is?

I have no idea.

I'll bet it's blue. The sky's blue.

The seas are blue. And the winds

blew, too.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Ryan and Aaron are staring at the body. Frank is on his

stomach, tops to tails with their father. Aaron looks at it and

decides that it's just wrong.

We can't leave it like that.

106.

Ryan looks down and laughs.

In a strange way, this might have been

what he wanted.

Be serious for a second.

They begin lifting him again.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Norman is doing his best to keep Reverend Davis at bay.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Aaron and Ryan have swiveled the body around so that Frank is

facing upwards.

Why do you say I don't take anything

seriously? You complain about me all

the time, but if I didn't play the bad

boy, you couldn't play the martyr.

Aaron's so great, Aaron's so right,

Aaron's so responsible.

(back to normal)

Why don't you try laughing and

enjoying life once in a while? It

might make you a better a writer.

INT. ENTRY CORRIDOR - DAY

Norman is still talking to Reverend Davis. She looks like she

really doesn't want to be there.

Look, I must get to a phone. There's

a man on the roof who's going to jump.

I'm addicted to strip clubs. The

shoes, the poles, the smell. I just

like to take my money and throw it in

the air. I like to make it rain.

107.

EXT. ROOF - DAY

Elaine is stepping off the fire escape ladder and onto the roof

peak. Oscar sits sadly on the roof peak with his back to the

crowd.

Oscar... Please don't do this...

love you.

Then why were you with him?

I wasn't with him.

Yes, you were! I saw you!

EXT. BACK GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

Derek is laughing next to Jeff. We see the view from their POV.

EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Elaine finally gets closer to Oscar.

I'll never be good enough. Not for

your dad, and not for you.

Oscar, please just come inside.

No. You go inside.

Come with me.

Why?

Because you're going to be a father.

Oscar looks at her, shocked.

What?

108.

I'm pregnant. We're going to have a

child...

ANGLE ON: Oscar and Elaine.

You're pregnant?

Oscar is overcome with emotion. Elaine holds out her hand.

I won't be able to do it without you.

Very slowly, a naked Oscar, walks toward her and they embrace.

The crowd applauds.

ANGLE ON: Michelle.

What about me?! I want a baby. Would

somebody get me pregnant?!

Everybody looks at Michelle. She smiles weakly.

EXT. BACK GARDEN - DAY

Seeing Oscar is safe, Jeff is very relieved.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Norman and the reverend hear applause. Reverend Davis heads

back out to see what's up. Norman turns to check on Ryan and

Aaron.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Aaron and Ryan are just about to close the lid. They both look

down at their father one last time. Aaron takes a moment to

touch his father's hand.

Bye, Dad.

Ryan takes a long look as he closes the coffin.

EXT. ROOF - DAY

Oscar turns toward the crowd.

109.

We're having a baby.

EXT. BACK GARDEN - DAY

General approval noises and applause come from the crowd.

Duncan looks appalled.

Great.

Duncan heads toward the kitchen door. He passes a shocked

looking Derek.

Michelle follows and speaks loudly as Duncan is about to enter

the kitchen.

Aaron?! Oscar's off the roof!

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Aaron and Ryan quickly shut the coffin a moment before Duncan

enters the living room through the kitchen door and crosses on

the way to the stairs.

I'm going to kill him.

Jeff follows Duncan in, looks at the coffin, then looks at Aaron

and Ryan questioning them with his eyes. They return the look

with silent assurance that the job is done. Michelle comes in.

Hey, is he gone?

Yeah.

Thank God.

Everybody breathes a sigh of relief.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Elaine helps Oscar through the window.

Thank you.

110.

DUNCAN (O.S.)

Elaine!

Elaine opens the bathroom door and Duncan enters. Elaine helps

Oscar get dressed.

Thank God you're safe.

You idiot! What the hell is wrong

with you? Stay away from my daughter.

Look, Dad--

Elaine, stay out of this.

No, I'm not staying out of this.

Remember how I told you we were moving

in together? Well, I lied. We're

getting married.

Duncan is shocked.

You're what?!

We're getting married.

Elaine, you don't have to marry him

just because you're pregnant.

I'm not marrying him because I'm

pregnant. I'm marrying him because I

love him.

How can you love him? He's an idiot.

Dad, this is my life. If you don't

like it, too bad. But if you want to

keep me and my child in your life,

you'd better change your attitude,

especially about my husband.

111.

Elaine exits, taking Oscar with her.

Bye, Dad.

They exit.

EXT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Cynthia walks up to Aaron.

Baby, I really think we should start

again now. Have you seen Uncle

Russell?

Aaron remembers where he is and looks at Ryan. They rush off to

the study, passing Jeff. Jeff checks his pockets and realizes

the pills are gone again. He goes off to find them.

INT. STUDY - DAY

Aaron and Ryan enter the study and head toward the closed

bathroom door. They open it and find Uncle Russell sitting on

the toilet.

What the hell is going on in this

place?

I'm so sorry, Uncle Russell. There

was someone on the roof--

Never mind that. What about that dead

body you dragged in here?

Aaron and Ryan feign ignorance.

What dead body?

Don't mess with me. I know a dead

body when I see one. I live in a

retirement home.

112.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Norman sniffs his fingers, worried. In the background we see

Elaine entering the room with Oscar, now dressed, but still

looking a bit wired. People respond with scattered applause and

congratulations.

Derek walks over and joins Norman.

Did you hear that? She's having a

kid!

Derek looks at Norman who's looking sort of distant.

How's your skin thing?

Oh that... It's probably nothing. I'm

more worried about Hepatitis C after

having Uncle Russell's shit in my

mouth. I think I'm feeling yellow.

Norman touches his skin as he walks away, leaving Derek

confused.

ANGLE ON: Jeff frantically looking for the pill bottle. He

gives up and sits in a chair.

ANGLE ON: Ryan is wheeling Uncle Russell into the room as Aaron

moves to his seat.

I'm telling you I saw the guy. He was

dead!

I know you did, Russell. We all did.

No! In the bathroom.

Ryan offers a look to the other mourners indicating that Uncle

Russell's a bit mad and shouldn't be listened to.

ANGLE ON: Michelle comes over to Aaron.

I can't believe what a nightmare today

has been.

113.

I don't know. It's been sort of

exciting.

Aaron looks at her.

For a funeral, I mean...

Listen, about the condo and the baby,

We'll work it out. Let's just get

this day over with. Then we can worry

about the rest of our lives.

Aaron hugs Michelle.

I can't believe I still have to do

this eulogy... with everything I've

just found out.

A beat.

It doesn't change anything, does it?

Not a thing.

Reverend Davis approaches Aaron, looking at her watch and

appearing flustered.

We're going to have to fly through

this now. I already missed a funeral

and two Christenings.

Sure. Let's go.

Do you want an open casket?

AARON/RYAN/NORMAN/JEFF

No!

The reverend looks shocked at the reaction, but ignores it. She

stands up at the front and speaks quickly.

114.

Alright! Everybody in their seats

now!

(she snaps her fingers)

Hey, you, sit down.

People settle into their seats. Ryan manages to squeeze in next

to Martina. He smiles at her, flirtatiously. Cynthia throws

Ryan a look, and he gets up and goes to sit with her.

REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D)

(speaking very quickly)

I'd like to apologize on behalf of the

family for all of the distractions. I

hope that everyone is settled and

ready to continue with the service.

Aaron, the oldest son, would like to

say a few words about his father.

Michelle gives Aaron an encouraging look as he makes his way to

the front.

Aaron clears his throat and prepares to begin. The room is

absolutely silent. He takes a deep breath.

ANGLE ON: The reverend nodding for Aaron to hurry up.

ANGLE ON: Aaron.

My father... was an exceptional--

BANG! BANG! BANG!

Suddenly, a loud banging emanates from the coffin. Everyone

stares at it in stunned silence. Jeff looks over to Norman

whose eyes are as wide as saucers. Aaron looks like a deer

caught in headlights. He looks at Ryan who gestures to him to

continue. He nervously struggles on.

My father was an exceptional man.

BANG! BANG! BANG!

Everyone stares at the coffin in awe. Aaron bravely continues.

Not only did he live for his family,

but he was always there for others--

BANG! BANG! BANG!

115.

What the hell is going on?

There's someone in there!

I knew it! I knew it!

Suddenly the coffin lid flips off and everyone stares in wonder

as Frank sits up, looking like a crazy person, and babbling

incoherently.

Several people scream. Frank opens the other end of the coffin

and looks at his dead lover.

(trying to cover)

What the hell are you doing in my

Dad's coffin?

Frank starts grabbing at Edward's body screaming.

Edward! Edward! Edward!

Ryan, Norman and Jeff try to pull Frank out of the coffin, but

he's holding onto the corpse.

No! No!

Finally they get Frank out and carry him from the room. As he

passes Cynthia, the photos fall out of his pocket at her feet.

As Duncan closes the coffin again, Cynthia bends down and picks

up one of the photographs and stares at it. Her face turns to

horror as she makes out the image. The noise in the room is

broken by Cynthia's furious cry. She drops the photos and runs

at Frank.

You bastard!

Cynthia tackles Frank and starts beating him.

(as she hits him)

He was with you!

Duncan picks up the photos. He shows them to Uncle Russell.

116.

I always thought he had a little sugar

in his tank.

Everything has descended into total chaos until Aaron finally

shouts across the room.

MY FATHER WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL MAN!!!

Everyone, including Frank and Cynthia, looks at Aaron, stunned.

They all freeze. There's a long silence.

He had his... shortcomings, but he

took care of his family. He loved his

family. He loved this house. He

worked hard. All I wanted today was

to show him how much we all loved and

admired him. To give him the respect

that he deserved... Is that really so

much to ask? We all get so distracted

by the... little things in life. We

forget about the important things.

Like the fact that we lost a great

man.

The mourners look up at Aaron with undivided attention.

So maybe he loved "Dreamgirls" more

than most men. We don't know why a

man makes the choices he makes. But I

do know that my father made the best

choices he could make. Life is

complicated. We're just thrown here

together in a world filled with chaos

and confusion... and we do our best.

And Dad did his best...

Aaron looks over at the coffin. As.he speaks, we see shots of

Cynthia, Frank, Jeff, Norman, Duncan as they are moved by

Aaron's words.

He taught us to go for what we wanted

in life, because you never know how

long you're going to be here... And

whether you succeed... or you fail...

the important thing is that you tried.

117.

A beat. Michelle looks up at her husband with pride. We see

the various other mourners looking at Aaron and listening.

So when you all leave here today, I

want you to remember Dad for who he

really was... A decent, loving man

who never condemned anyone for how

they lived. Who never cast

disparaging remarks or held prejudices

against race, gender... height. If

only we could all be as giving, as

generous, as understanding as my

father... Even dead, my father has

more character than everyone in this

room. If I am half the man my father

was, my child will be incredibly

blessed.

Aaron turns and walks out of the room. Everyone watches him go.

Michelle follows him out of the room.

EXT. HOUSE - ESTABLISHING SHOT

The house has emptied out. All the cars are gone.

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER - EVENING

Aaron is laying on the couch, looking drained. Ryan comes down

the stairs. It looks like he's had some time to recover. He

walks over and takes a seat.

How's Mom?

She's resting.

A beat.

I've asked Mom to come live with me

for awhile. It'll give you and

Michelle a chance to breathe a bit,

you know. Move and everything.

Aaron looks at Ryan, surprised.
