She's frantic.   Debbie takes Bruno aside.

Bruno turns back to Loretta, trying to calm her.

AS he speaks, Bruno SEES Tommy pass through the hallway

Bruno puts an arm on Tommy. Tommy instantly assumes a

frantic, wimpy, craven persona, along wth his CARRIBBEAN

ACCENT.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             10.

We can almost see the light bulb click on above Bruno's

head.

Bruno snorts agreement, goes for his wallet... Tommy goes

gor the ring... then suddenly leaps back in a cringe!

Bruno snaps and GRABS TOMMY BY THE COLLAR.

He starts to leave.   Bruno grabs him.

Another lightbulb.

Bruno's had enough -- his grip tightens around Tommy's

neck.

Bruno picks up a house phone, dials.

ARMANDO, still unshaven, answers the RINGING phone.

INTERCUT with Bruno in the lobby.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              12.

ARMANDO hangs up the phone and exits the hotel room.

BRUNO crosses to the far side of the lobby, where Tommy

waits inconspicuously. He gives him the money. Tommy

gives him ring.

As Tommy heads back to the function room, Bruno picks up

a house phone, dials, listens. He dials again, listens.

No answer. He dials the operator.

He hangs up, looks at the ring, and realizes he's been

taken. His face twisting with rage, he hurries after

Tommy.

Surprised, Tommy opts for an EAST INDIAN ACCENT.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             13.

As Zeke's face flushes in anger, Tommy SEES Bruno come

into the room, blood in his eye. Tommy turns sharply and

heads out the terrace doors to the --

Tommy conceals himself behind a pillar, across the court-

yard, away from the Guests. But from another direction,

Johnson and Andersen approach, arm in arm, and sit on a

bench by the pillar.

Tommy moves away from the pillar, sees Bruno roaming the

terrace, and retreats.

Andersen's eyes widen in astonishment.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             14.

Bruno has gone.   But Tommy stays.   His eyes light up at

the money.

Johnson smiles at the direction the conversation is

taking.

ON Tommy also smiling, in admiration at the transaction

going down.

Johnson stands, puts his arm on Andersen.

Tommy emerges, shakes his head, and laughs.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92                   14A.

A ramshackle bait shack, paint peeling, on the inland

waterway. At the rear of the shack, Armando shoots hoops

into a tattered net. Loretta, back in jeans, looks at

her watch.

A bondo-patched Econoline van pulls up. Tommy jumps out,

big smile. He gives Loretta an energetic round of

APPLAUSE.

But she doesn't want the charm.

He pulls out the wad of bills.       Their faces brighten

considerably.

Washington, D.C.   The illuminated dome of the Capitol.

CAMERA ROAMS the well-hung walls. From the photos and

memorabilia, we realize that we are in the office of Rep.

Jeff Johnson.

In the reflections on the frames, we GLIMPSE some

MOVEMENT on the desk explaining the considerable

BREATHING and MOANING (O.S.).

But then a strange GURGLING sound (O.S.) escapes from

Johnson.

A silent beat.   Then a horrified CRY.      Jennifer rises

INTO FRAME.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            14B.

The congregation is SINGING. We SEE the widow Johnson.

At her side, in the aisle seat, a powerful man with bushy

eyebrows, about 60, in a three-piece suit and watch

chain: congressman DICK DODGE. The HYMN ends. Dodge

steps up to the pulpit.

He presses the tips of his fingers together and looks

skyward, as if communing with his memory of the deceased.

ANGLE ON Jennifer, in black.

Vera sneaks a look at Jennifer, who is poker-faced.

On the veranda of the gracious  home, mourners pay

respects to the family. Dodge   puts a gentle hand on

the widow's shoulder and draws  her aside. He throws

a look at Jennifer, who joins  them.

Vera stares at Jennifer.   She knows the score.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              16.

Jennifer, embarrassed, didn't know Vera knew.    Nor

did Dodge.

A retirement community in the Florida sunshine.

open. A supermarket shopping cart full of groceries,

tied with a big bow, rolls out, pushed by Tommy. Loretta

accompanies him.

Tommy BUZZES at a door. It's answered by Tommy's

GRANDMA, a limber lady in leggings and a bright top.

She sees the groceries, kisses him.

Tommy and Loretta are watching the track results on the

local tv news. Tommy, playing solitaire, shuffles bril-

liantly. Grandma comes in from the kitchen, shaking

her head.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             17.

VIDEO...a cheap TV spot -- a busty blonde in a skimpy

outfit tossing her hair and pouting.

VIDEO...Scantily-clad babes to match the names.    Loretta

speaks along with the V.O.

SUPER:   CALL 1-900-555-NATO.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               18.

Loretta gets up and goes for the kitchen. We hear a

high-pitched ELECTRONIC WARBLE. Tommy reaches into

Loretta's purse and pulls out a cellular phone.

He opens the phone and speaks in a toneless, recording-

like voice.

He covers the mouthpiece and calls to Loretta.

TOMMY grins mischievously and speaks into the phone in

the husky voice of a SWEDISH WOMAN.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             19.

Laughing, he hangs up.

He clicks off the phone and slams it back into Loretta's

purse. Loretta, meanwhile, has reappeared.

She goes to her sewing basket and pulls something from

it. She unfolds it: a long piece of needlepoint she's

been working on.

INSERT

It spells out Tommy's full name:   Thomas Jefferson

Johnson.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             20.

BACK TO SCENE

In the silence between them that follows, we HEAR the tv.

The editorial catches Grandma's attention.

Tommy's eyes widen.

HOMER, the proprietor of Homer's Pit Stop, wearing fuel-

smeared overalls, is dieseling a Customer's boat down by

the water.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               20A.

Up by the racks of junk food and beer, and pails of fish

slop, Tommy and Armando await Homer. In b.g., an older

black gentleman plays checkers, solo. This is VAN DYKE.

ON LORETTA on the pay phone, moaning in Swedish ecstasy.

Tommy grabs the phone.   He pushes aside a protesting

Loretta...

He smacks the receiver with his hand.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            21.

They all look at him expectantly. He takes a dramatic

pause, then launches into a "Come to Jesus" speech.

His big smile meets their blank surprise.   Their faces

fall.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            22.

Tommy produces a sheaf of Xeroxes and pamphlets.

Loretta wolf-WHISTLES.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92           23.

Senior citizens fold brochures, stuff envelopes, make

phone calls. Van Dyke and Tommy enter.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            24.

Tommy and Van Dyke are seated opposite HATTIE RIFKIN, a

high-energy woman, 70s, with a frizz of white curls.

Tommy breaks up.   In spite of himself, he's charmed by the

salty old babe.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            25.

Hattie cracks up.   Tommy leans over and translates for

Van Dyke:

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92                26.

She ponders for a minute.    And then she gets it.   A

wicked smile.

The widow Johnson is pouring tea for Tommy, now in super-

nerd drag -- wire-rim glasses and tweed sport jacket.

PAN TO TOMMY training a home video camera on a poster that

reads JEFF JOHNSON FOR CONGRESS.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             29.

The poster fills the screen.

A very puzzled Vera Johnson watches the ad on tv.

The congressional district sleeps. But   in the darkness,

a kind of D-Day onslaught is under way.   QUICK SUPER-

IMPOSED CUTS of Tommy's secret army of  Silver Foxes,

opening crates, fanning through parking  lots, swarming

over lawns, driving in stakes, tacking  up posters

everywhere.

INCLUDE Tommy climbing a telephone pole... Armando shinnying

up a light pole across the street... Loretta and Van Dyke

pulling on a rope... which hoists a huge bundle to Tommy...

who opens and unfolds it... and gets an end through the

air to Armando. They unfurl the biggest banner imaginable.

CAMERA TILTS DOWN. Every square    inch of town seems to

have been plastered with JOHNSON   FOR CONGRESS material.

It's on billboards, bumpers, bus   shelters, balloons,

banners, utility poles... all in   the late congressman's

signature design.

The Econoline, now a JOHNSON ad on wheels, ghetto-blasters

mounted front and back on the roof, rolls by a Jewish deli

...a soul food joint... a whitebread country club... a

Chinese restaurant... At each, Tommy's amplified VOICE says:

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             31.

The small crowd -- Tommy's cronies, their pals, and a

jubilant contingent of Panthers led by Hattie -- lets

out a great WHOOP.

For the first time, we see Tommy wearing a beautifully-cut

suit. He's instantly engulfed by lights, cameras, and

Supporters.

An amazed CAMERAMAN, watching Tommy, whispers to a Producer.

Tommy jumps onto a bench.    APPLAUSE from his Supporters.

They do. As APPLAUSE continues (O.S.), CAMERA PANS from

Reporter to Reporter to Reporter, their mikes bearing the

call-letters of different channels.

ON GRANDMA being interviewed. She wears a JOHNSON FOR

CONGRESS button and speaks with manifest pride.

PAN TO FLORIDA REPORTER #2 doing a stand-up.

PAN TO --

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             32.

ON Tommy. Speaking meaningfully, with great sincerity,

he shows a gift for political discourse.

Tommy looking out the window at the city below.

The approach to National Airport gives a good view of

Washington and its landmarks.

The plane touches down.

Through the airport move our Floridians. They look like

they're going to opening day at the track.

Tommy looks. It's REINHHARDT, a young straight-arrow

bearing two huge document briefcases, which he puts down

to shake hands.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              33.

Reinhardt looks Tommy's cronies over.     Not your classic

Hill types.

They look at one another, puzzled.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              34.

The entourage is enjoying a round of libations.

Reinhardt runs up.

Tommy's entourage and their luggage are being packed into

a cab. Tommy turns to Reinhardt.

Reinhardt hasn't heard it put quite that way before.

Reinhardt gets his courage up.

Tommy looks at his own troops, then back to Reinhardt.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            35.

Tommy opens the cab door.

Tommy gets in and closes the door.

The bridge over the Potomac has a classic view of the

Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument. Their

taxi drives by.

Morning. Tommy and cronies get out of a cab and bound up

the grand flight of stairs. In b.g., the Capitol dome.

They walk the superb ground floor corridor of Cannon,

salivating. Marble columns... chandeliers... grand

offices. Real class.

AT AN ELEVATOR with a sign above it -- MEMBERS ONLY --

they stop. Tommy presses the button. The door opens.

The seated ATTENDANT gets a load of this group.

Especially Loretta.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             36.

Looking puzzled, they make their way up a drab stairwell.

Not classy. On one side of the hallway, the windows give

out on a brutally ugly courtyard. On the other side of

the hall are cages: windowless storage bins behind metal

fences crammed with junk -- and an occasional xerox

machine, Mr. Coffee, and pitiful staffer at a tiny desk.

Tommy opens the door to 609.

Tommy's office is a small, dark garret, with dirty car-

peting, bare shelves, and a pile of bulging canvas U.S.

Mail bags.

He heads further into the office.

Equally unattractive.   Perched on the desk:   Reinhardt.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             37.

Tommy gives Reinhardt a good once-over, seeing him anew.

Tommy laughs, then clasps Reinhardt's shoulders.

BEGIN elegant, spirited classical MUSIC.

With its hundred-foot barrel-vaulted ceiling and grand

windows, the magnificent Beaux-Arts station has been

beautifully restored.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             38.

A big crowd slowly makes its way along a red carpet to

the party.

Tommy was born to wear a  tux. In his  lapel, a red-and-

gold eagle pin. On his   arm, Loretta, in a dramatic

shoulderless and nearly  backless gown, with three-quarter

gloves. The other Women   in sight are far more conserva-

tively dressed.

A STRING QUARTET provides the music. Tommy and Loretta

linger uncertainly near the entrance. Then:

Tommy leads her over to two Men, 30s, excellent haircuts.

Both wear pins. He extends a hand.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            39.

He puts his face close to Tommy.

A tense beat.   Then Rafe breaks into a smile.

Bo winks at Tommy.

She extends a regal hand to each, Liza Doolittle at the

ball.

The origins of the gentlemen's political success is not

lost on Tommy.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              42.

TABLE - NIGHT

Tommy shakes hands around the table, taking business

cards as he goes.

TOMMY'S TABLEMATE is lawyer-lobbyist TOMMY O'CONNOR, 40s.

As Waiters serve lobster bisque, he hands TJ a business

card.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             43.

O'Connor points.    ON THE DAIS, Andersen is engrossed with

Dodge.

BACK TO SCENE

making a speech from the dais.

Tommy inspects the sea of barracudas.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            44.

In b.g., the Capitol dome. As Tommy and Loretta leave,

they pass Dick Dodge, who is saying goodnight to guests.

He stops them.

She pronounces the word so carefully, it sounds lewd.

Tommy and Dodge walk up steps toward the Capitol.

A darkened hallway. A hand-lettered sign by a door reads

COMMITTEE ON POWER AND INDUSTRY. THE CHAIRMAN. MR.

DODGE. Tommy and Dodge approach. As Dodge unlocks the

door:

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            45.

A single table lamp lights Dick Dodge's office, reflecting

off the velvet drapes, sculpted ceiling, and crystal

chandeliers. Tommy and Dodge are in leather armchairs,

ties undone. On the table between them, a bottle of Jim

Beam. Dodge casts a cool eye on Tommy.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              46.

A stunned silence from Dodge -- then deep and generous

laughter.

He laughs again, richly amused.   Tommy joins in the

laughter.

Shining in the bright sun.

Hundreds of business cards. An expert riffle, a one-

handed cut, and Tommy deals lightning fast, a perfect

diamond formation with two cards in the middle. He turns

them over one at a time.

He reaches for the phone...

Pan from Capitol Hill to gleaming glass office building.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            47.

Expensive furniture, rugs, and art.

INTERCUT TOMMY AND KORNGOLD

The SPEAKER administers the oath of office to the

assembled House.

ON GRANDMA next to Tommy, eyes welling with pride. It's

the one day a year that non-Members (meaning families)

can be on the floor.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              48.

The 435 Members (with family) taking the oath, watched

on C-span by Loretta, Armando, Van Dyke, and Reinhardt.

ON IOWA taking the oath, his toddler in his arms.     PAN

along faces of other Members... to Tommy.

Sustained APPLAUSE.   Tommy kisses Grandma.

INTERCUT Tommy's cronies APPLAUDING.

ON THE FLOOR Tommy dries Grandma's tears with a finger.

Tommy smiles ambiguously. As APPLAUSE continues, his

eyes roam the room and make contact with Dick Dodge,

standing at one of the leadership tables. Tommy winks

conspiratorially at him. There's such diabolical glee in

it, it even takes Dodge aback.

A beautiful black woman, 20s, walks briskly down the

busy Cannon corridors. CELIA. There's intelligence in

her eyes, and fire.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            49.

She makes her way down the corridor,

exchanging AD LIB greetings, glancing in at the sedate

receptions, and drawing closer to the source of the

REGGAE (O.S.) -- Tommy's office. She looks in.

It's packed, mainly with men.  Everyone has drinks and

talks noisily. It looks like  a fraternity smoker for

lobbyists. MUSIC comes from  a boom box. The bar -- a

tablecloth over some desks -- is lavishly stocked. So are

the bookcases, which now look like liquor store shelves.

ANGLE ON LORETTA, in a cocktail dress and a HELLO MY NAME

IS MISS LORETTA badge, staffing a little table, handing

Celia a name-tag.

INSERT

Celia's hands print CELIA KIRBY.    PRO BONO.

BACK TO SCENE - ON Tommy and Reinhardt talking with a

LOBBYIST.

Tommy looks at Reinhardt, who explains.

Loretta appears with a platter of food.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            49A.

Tommy steers her aside and takes a roll of soggy,

toothpick-impaled herring.

She points at the food table. There's nothing but a

few boxes of crackers and two huge mounds of herring --

one white, one pink. The centerpiece is a large

smoked fish, eyes staring accusingly.

He breaks off, as Celia comes into view in the doorway

behind. Tommy picks her up on his radar.

We follow Tommy through the crowd until he reaches Celia.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            49B.

Tommy has to laugh.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             49C.

She slips out through the sea of revelers.

A fine Washington morning.

Rep. ELIJAH MARSHALL, 50s, black, and a pain in Dodge's

ass, is shaking hands and saying goodbye to some

Constituents. Dodge approaches.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 3/25/92            50.

They start walking.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            51.

Dodge takes his glasses from his pocket and wipes them.

Dodge and Marshall enter.

Tommy enters.   Marshall gives him a once-over and extends

a hand.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            52.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              53.

The committee members -- all white males, except Tommy --

mill around, awaiting the start of the hearings. As the

TV cameras whir, Dodge shakes Tommy's hand warmly. Big

smiles and an explosion of flashbulbs.

Dodge breaks off and Tommy drifts over to Reinhardt.

Reinhardt puts his hand on Tommy's shoulders.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               54.

Suddenly, Dodge reappears.   He throws his arm around

Tommy's shoulders.

Dodge steers TJ to a preppy-looking man at the witness

table -- BARCLAY "SKEETER" WARBURTON.

WARBURTON'S voice is aristocratic, a la George Plimpton.

As Dodge and Tommy head for the dais, Tommy imitates

Warburton's lockjaw.

Dodge chuckles, shakes his head in mock rebuke. Tommy

takes his seat at the lower dais, smiles at the Members

on his left and right.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             55.

ON THE UPPER DAIS, Dodge gavels...

THE BIGGEST EXPLOSION OF FLASHES YET... and as the motor

drives whir, Tommy flashes his biggest smile yet.

Tommy's office walls are now richly hung with plaques,

awards, and framed photos. We see he has been named the

PESTICIDE COALITION'S Man of the Month. The winner of

the NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION'S Achievement Award. The

MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA'S Outstanding Young

Legislator. Etc. The liquor is gone.

Loretta is at the receptionist's desk.   A LOBBYIST

enters.

He sits and opens his briefcase. Van Dyke approaches him

with the dignity of a superb butler.

Tommy rises to speak at a breakfast meeting. The podium

bears the seal of the American Poultry Association.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            56.

He sits down to generous APPLAUSE. ON Armando, in

attendance, CLAPPING, marveling at the response TJ gets.

Capitol Hill is actually two worlds: the aboveground

buildings that visitors and television cameras see, and

the catacombs, the busy tunnels and corridors connecting

the congressional office buildings and the Capitol.

They're surprisingly unglamorous -- exposed pipes, white-

washed brick walls, dumpsters, pizza carry-outs -- and

through them move the legislators and their staffs.

And here is Tommy, whistling ZIPPEDY DOO DAH. He loves

this place. Passing a snack bar, he greets the Cashier.

He blows a kiss to a pretty Teller in the credit union.

Passing the barber shop, he calls out to the Shoeshine

Guy. He passes a black TELEPHONE MAN at an open panel of

wires.

Several lobbyists are now awaiting Tommy balancing plates

of herring on their knees. Some are enjoying it more

than others. Tommy breezes in.

Tommy hits a button on a tape deck, turning on some EASY

LISTENING.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            57.

BEHIND THE DIVIDER, outside Tommy's office door, Tommy has

a word with Reinhardt. Tommy indicates his office.

Reinhardt nods.   Tommy gives himself a couple of squirts of

Binaca.

Tommy and Reinhardt meeting with Celia and an elfin guy

in corduroy.

She pulls documents from her briefcase and hands them to

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               59.

She gives him a look.    Ira turns to Tommy.

On a door in the House sub-basement:    MEMBERS ONLY.

The regular evening pickup basketball game. Even among

these ruthless players, Tommy's street moves are outstand-

ingly down and dirty. His principal accomplice: Elijah

Marshall.

A standing poker game among the towel- and robe-clad

Members.

It's Tommy's shuffle and deal.    He is convincingly awkward.

A BULLDOG of a man examines his hand, tosses two cards in.

He assembles his new hand. Four fives and an ace.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               60.

ON Tommy's hand.   A pair of threes.

The betting starts, at a couple of chips, and comes round

to Tommy. He pushes a stack of chips to the center.

Tommy, Marshall, and the Bulldog, back in suits, exit the

MEMBERS ONLY door and move through the catacombs.

The Bulldog gives Tommy a friendly squeeze --

-- and leaves them.   Tommy and Marshall continue on.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92           60A.

BELLS begin RINGING and LIGHTS FLASHING on all the clocks

and sconces down the corridor. Three RINGS, pause,

three RINGS, pause... Marshall does a U-turn. Tommy

doesn't follow suit.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            62.

Tommy has no idea, but he's certainly open to

suggestions.

Tommy thinks it through.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92          63.

A briefing in progress. Flip charts, ring binders, Celia,

Ira, a couple of other Pro Bono types. Tommy is riveted

by Celia.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            64.

Tommy's staff shares one small office.   Everyone's on the

phone.

Van Dyke puts him on hold, counts to three, gets back on

the line.

PAN TO Armando.

PAN TO Loretta, who chalks the figure onto a toteboard.

On Loretta's bulletin board is a map of the United States,

with flags, pushpins, and air travel routes.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              65.

Celia continues her briefing.

As she starts rummaging in her briefcase, we TRACK AROUND

EXACT WORDS HE'S JUST SPOKEN.

RACK FOCUS...reveals REINHARDT in b.g., sitting at

another computer terminal. He is typing in Tommy's
