Rush Hour

FADE IN:

EXT.  LOS ANGELES - DAY

The whole dysfunctional megalopolis, beige and blurry in the

summer smog. If this is the American Dream, do me a favor and

wake me up.

EXT.  LAX - DAY

The traffic loop outside the terminals is gridlocked -- mostly

with stretch limousines.

INT.  LAX - (INCLUDE NEWS REPORT MONTAGE) - DAY

Inside, the airport is done up with festive posters, streamers

and banners: Welcome - Pacific Partners Summit

A planeload of cheerful CHINESE DELEGATES come into the

crowded terminal. Some sport red T-shirts with a picture of

Mao wearing Mickey Mouse ears.

They get onto the people mover, passing by a TV REPORTER:

The SCENE changes to TAPE of DELEGATES from other countries

arriving.

Then, we see massive SECURITY PREPARATIONS all around the city.

We CUT TO a heated debate in the UN SECURITY COUNCIL.

Then ARTILLERY FIRE over the Korean DMZ.

The SCENE returns to LAX.

EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

An exclusive, walled-off section of Hancock Park. There's only

one route in and out, past a manned guardhouse on Wilshire.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

A Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought-

iron fence. There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean,

next to the entranceway:

The driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted

windows and diplomatic license plates glides out.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

An alert North Korean CORPORAL watches the perimeter MONITORS.

He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes.

EXT.  UTILITY POLE - OLYMPIC BLVD - DAY

From atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars

overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place.

HIS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS

as the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood.

BACK TO SCENE

The man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy

hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see

his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray.

Javal takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription

bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to

a van with a phone company logo on it.

EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns

into the heavy morning traffic.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

It is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows

and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis.

The DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside

him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun.

A HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and

turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off.

NEW ANGLE

The hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and

sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged

Scandinavian GOVERNESS.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Javal's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It

follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving. He

glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control REMOTE

UNITS sitting on the seat next to him.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Traffic is moving at about 35 MPH. The Mercedes merges onto

the freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows.

The thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings

as a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to "11" cruises by.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Even 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence.

The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts

on his blinker to take the 405 South exit.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a

procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass

arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

As they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a

switch on his radio-control unit...

CLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS

Six small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps

on the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds

of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately,

scores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT...

WIDER

Causing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most

hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction

PILE-UP you can imagine.

Dozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe

their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some

fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still

coming onto the overpass.

Brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy,

glass shatters.

And then it gets really nasty...

A Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The

truck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant.

It SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail...

Along with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept

over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans.

They plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver

slams on the brakes. He barely avoids hitting anything.

EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

A nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims. The

Mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic.

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN & ROADWAY - DAY

Javal slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He

slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it.

ANGLE WITH JAVAL

as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and

rolls under the Mercedes.

The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal

stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He

attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it,

then rolls back toward the van.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Oblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as

police and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP

motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Sweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks

another radio unit. Working.

EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

The CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and

traffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by,

Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the

Mercedes onto the 405 south.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio

unit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit.

Javal fingers the radio unit, itching to use it...

But he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

Javal's device is armed, and waiting...

EXT.  SIERRA BONITA AVENUE - CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single-

family homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards.

Every house on the block except the one we're in front of has

a "For Sale" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the

signs, they've been there for quite a while.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly.

PETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering

him. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly.

Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight,

muscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well.

Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes

above all else that one should never raise one's voice.

Carson groans... he's DREAMING...

EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (CARSON'S DREAM) - DAY

Quick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape.

Cops, SWAT teams, FBI surround BEVERLY THRIFT, a bank.

Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK

across from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in

his hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck.

Suddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the

bank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it...

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT

Carson is snapped awake by a CAR ALARM going off outside.

He bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped

bikini briefs. Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned...

He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad,

its LCD reading "ARMED."

He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand.

Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door

open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING.

MIRANDA

pulls the pillows over her head and sighs.

EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by

the streetlight --

Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang

convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've

made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop.

Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying

the ignition switch out of the dashboard.

Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a

crowbar. His partner keeps working.

NEW ANGLE

Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the

crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts

BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice.

Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each

other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal

echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming

house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS.

Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto

the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS.

As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler

heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out.

Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it

into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over.

Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against

his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm

breaks, and Carson tosses him aside.

Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off

toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot

faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet.

WIDER

Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and

FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street --

And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned.

Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp

screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it.

Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A

WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble

with their sidearms.

Asshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the

screwdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards.

ANGLE ACROSS STREET

Carson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas

and a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him.

The Guards seem to get it. Without warning, one takes out a

TASER and ZAPS Asshole #2. Carson lets go just in time.

CLOSER

Holding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house. He

notices the "Neighborhood Watch" sign has graffiti spray-

painted on it. He touches it -- the paint is still wet. His

Neighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do?

The PAPER GUY drives by... and tosses Carson's newspaper right

under the gushing SPRINKLER.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY

Joy is standing on the toilet, blowing cigarette smoke into

the exhaust fan. Someone KNOCKS on the door. She flicks the

cigarette into the toilet, puts a ZIPPO LIGHTER in her pocket.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Joy opens the bathroom door. Sam is standing there, grinning.

She quickly closes the door behind her. Sam laughs.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Sam and Joy sit at the table. AMBASSADOR HAN and MRS. HAN are

having breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish.

Ambassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiquEs.

He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's

dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit.

Mrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her

husband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a

summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders.

Ambassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the

"Nirvana" logo on his T-shirt.

Ambassador Han's X-ray stare turns to Joy.

A BUTLER appears with a phone. He WHISPERS to Mrs. Han.

CUTAWAY - CLOSE ON GOVERNESS

as she speaks into a cellular phone. She's extremely nervous.

We cannot see her surroundings.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

In the back of his van, Javal pats the Governess' hand.

He speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an

orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a

quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors.

Javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess'

upper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a

gravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest.

He drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a

small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM AND BEDROOM - DAY

Carson steps out of the shower. He looks exhausted. Toweling

off, he goes into the bedroom, where Miranda is riding an

exercise bike, listening to music on headphones and reading

the sprinkler-soaked newspaper, all while watching the TV.

ANGLE ON TV

A perky blonde traffic reporter, BOBBI MARCHFELDER, talks to

us from a local NEWS COPTER.

We CUT TO the White House lawn, where the PRESIDENT is about

to board a helicopter.

We CUT BACK to the studio and the MORNING ANCHOR.

We CUT TO a MUSICAL MONTAGE of preparations for the events

around town.

BACK TO SCENE

As the MUSIC swells, Carson turns the TV off.

Miranda points at the headphones -- she can't hear him.

As Carson dresses, we get a LOOK at their bedroom -- Miranda's

nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los

Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them.

Carson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines

about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington;

Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina."

INT./EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO & KITCHEN - DAY

Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes,

is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and

wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some

sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter.

Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak

and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast

and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand."

Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the

rose bushes.

She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading.

Carson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces

from the cut in his side.

Carson glances at his watch and gets up.

He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229,

9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker.

Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI.

Miranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she

sadly watches him go.

EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - DAY

A look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some

YOUNG KIDS laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus.

He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street.

He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket.

The parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch

sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10 AM.

Carson CHIRPS open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960.

As he pulls away, we SEE a bumper sticker on the car: a circle

and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy

bears on the other, and "Arms Are For Hugging" in between.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

The Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the

Consulate. We notice there is ANOTHER MERCEDES parked inside.

Mrs. Han, Sam and Joy come outside. They hear some heartfelt

SWEARING:

THEIR POV

In the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit

has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible.

The JAG OWNER's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, LISA, sits in

the car with her schoolbooks in her lap.

JOY

turns to Mrs. Han:

INT./EXT.  MERCEDES - DAY

It pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is

still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes.

Joy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As the Mercedes travels its usual route down Crenshaw, Javal's

van begins following it.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

where Javal's DEVICE is attached, still waiting...

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

A dark-green government Dodge pulls up and parks behind one

just like it on a paved area near the Consulate gate.

DAVE JUAREZ, (chubby, 40, Mexican-American, a desk jockey) gets

out of the Dodge and hangs an FBI shield over his top pocket.

He glances over at North Korean Security Chief COLONEL LEE,

(45), who has paused inside the gate to regard Dave, and the

outside world, with profound contempt.

Dave, attachE case in one hand and notebook computer in the

other, walks to a 10-by-15 detached guardhouse on the far

corner of the property, just outside the high fence.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside are two desks and four chairs, a console of

communication equipment, a microwave and a Mr. Coffee.

Dave enters. Two FBI agents, finishing their shift, gather

their belongings: ROBBINS (late 20's; male; thinning hair) and

SABATINI, (early 30's; cute; dark, bobbed hair; female).

They wear blue FBI blazers and have standard-FBI-issue 10mm

Heckler & Koch MP-5 machine pistols in oversized shoulder

rigs. Dave is in civilian clothes, and is not armed.

He glances through the window at Colonel Lee.

Sabatini makes the jerk-off sign with her hand.

Dave takes three PCMCIA computer cards from his attachE case.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The van drives in the lane alongside the Mercedes.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

HUMMING, Javal drives with one hand, while tapping with his

other on the top of the radio-controlled remote box.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As they approach the light at Washington Blvd, just turning

yellow, Javal's van gets in front of the Mercedes.

Their lanes stop for the red light. A FRUIT VENDOR holding a

bag of oranges walks from car to car.

Javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until

his rear bumper taps gently against the Mercedes' front bumper.

INT.  MERCEDES - INCLUDE POV THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR - DAY

The Driver hits the HORN. The van doesn't move. The Driver

glances in the rear-view:

There's a Jeep Cherokee tight on his tail, and the BLACK LADY

in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of 8-year-old KIDS.

The Driver looks at Mrs. Han, who's peering out the side

window, fascinated by the African-American-themed storefronts.

They're all festooned with Summit-related banners, and SHOP

OWNERS are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar.

Sam, bored, stuffs several pieces of GUM into his mouth.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - SAME

Javal flips the switch on his radio-controlled remote.

INSERT

Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to

emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

The GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone

inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver

grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car.

Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of

his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun.

He SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun

muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it

is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge

cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium.

The Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his

machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of

BURNING magnesium shrapnel.

WIDER

The other drivers in the intersection see this and go

completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards.

Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic.

The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the

floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car.

Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs.

Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away.

Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down.

He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points

the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices

Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it.

He spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over

his dashboard to get a look at the action.

Javal SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another

bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the

entire front of his car burst into FLAMES.

Mrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm

and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors.

He tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the

kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on

both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs.

Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs

the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of

Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other

handcuff to Lisa.

Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Several people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the

Driver, who lies DEAD and SMOLDERING on the ground.

His hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a

small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Colonel Lee and a North Korean Army OFFICER come running out.

ANOTHER OFFICER starts up a car in the back of the house.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins and Sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate.

Dave follows.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Ambassador Han runs out. He has a stricken look on his face.

Ambassador Han nods. The FBI agents run up. To them:

The agents look at each other -- holy shit! Colonel Lee's car

SCREECHES to a stop. Sabatini stands in front of it.

Colonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7.62x25mm-caliber

pistol in her face as he's opening the car door.

Colonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost

running Sabatini over.

The agents rush back to their guardhouse. Dave's government

Dodge is blocking theirs.

Dave tosses them to Robbins. Sabatini shoves Dave into the

back seat. He looks at her, dumbfounded.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the ACCELERATION.

Sabatini grabs the red flashing light, puts it on the dashboard.

EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Just as they race out of Fremont Place past the guard gate,

Carson, in Miranda's Volvo, comes in on the other side.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson sees the agents in the Dodge and floors the Volvo. He

fishtails, making a U-turn.

He straddles the lanes on Wilshire to pull up next to them.

All the cars in front of them swerve to clear out of the way.

He rolls down his window. Sabatini shouts over to him:

Carson looks like he's been punched in the stomach.

Sabatini takes a small two-way MOTOROLA RADIO out of her

pocket and throws it through her window to Carson. Dropping it

in his lap, he punches the gas. Robbins floors Dave's piece-of-

shit Dodge, trying to keep up.

EXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Diplomatic Liaison EARL WALTHER is using the reflection in his

office window to adjust his necktie. Walther is 30, good-

looking, black; a GS lifer working his way up the ranks by

virtue of his quiet competence.

A CO-WORKER sticks his head into the office, then shields his

eyes from the sight of Walther's sharp new suit.

Walther's SECRETARY rushes in.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson drives with one hand, while holding the radio.

Real easy, until he narrowly MISSES a bunch of cars when

SCREECHING around a corner.

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Walther presses the intercom button on the phone.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson turns the frequency on his two-way.

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Driving skillfully, Carson edges past the North Koreans.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

And then, Carson can't believe it: he spots Javal's van, a

couple blocks ahead, driving at normal speed.

He looks over at Colonel Lee, whose car is pacing his.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S CAR - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Glaring, Colonel Lee looks over at the FBI cars as they pass.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sabatini pulls out her machine pistol, and tosses the two-way

to Dave. He looks scared, and carsick.

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Carson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

He still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic.

HIS POV

As Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal NOTICES the government-

issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo.

JAVAL

grins... it's show-time. He STOMPS on the gas.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Driving fast, Javal makes a hard right. As the van leans with

the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on

the floor -- the Governess' BODY, bloodied and grotesque under

the plastic tarp it's wrapped in.

Joy starts SCREAMING, as does everyone else when they see it.

Javal pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and FIRES a

deafening round through the roof of the van.

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

During a lull in traffic, a WELL-DRESSED WOMAN jaywalks across

the street. An LAPD black-and-white changes lanes and puts on

its flashing lights. As two COPS write her a ticket...

Around the corner TWO MEN make a quick exchange of money and a

vial of crack.

NEW ANGLE

The Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the

FBI Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit. They shove the

ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car.

EXT.  LA CIENEGA BLVD / SIDE STREETS - DAY

Javal turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down

apartment buildings. He takes a circuitous route, gaining a

one-block lead on Carson and the others.

Then, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal hits a remote garage door opener. Ahead, rickety doors

on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up.

Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an

empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the

same direction as Javal is driving.

Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and

then quickly backs up into the garage.

INT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE / JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

As he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards

into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the

rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap-

buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed.

Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging

from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door

from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED.

Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly-

constructed remotes:

INT.  DUPLICATE VAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid.

A set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine;

Engage the transmission;

And supply fuel to the carburetor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS

The duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up

to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley

behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal.

The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main

road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The

duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and

the rear walls of buildings...

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to

avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley.

Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the

alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster.

The duplicate van CRASHES into the garbage truck and EXPLODES.

NEW ANGLE

Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini

run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van.

Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick.

Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face.

Carson shoves Colonel Lee out of his way, hard.

Colonel Lee comes back, ready for a fight. Carson is happy to

oblige, but Robbins grabs Carson's arm.

By now, ONLOOKERS have begun to gather, as LAPD black-and

whites and helicopters converge on the area.

EXT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE - DAY

A block away, the garage door opens, and we hear something

eerie and unexpected: a scratchy, music-box kids' SONG, coming

from a loudspeaker.

Javal's van pulls out and we see its TRANSFORMATION: The

superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look

like a graffiti-covered, unlicensed ice cream vendor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

The entrance of the alley is blocked by a black-and-white. So,

accompanied by the SONG, Javal drives along the one-way alley

in his camouflaged van, passing unnoticed by the authorities.

Anguished, Carson is staring at the BURNING duplicate van...

EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Beverly Thrift EXPLODES and BURNS...

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Carson tries to shake the memory away. He looks around, sensing

that something isn't right, then turns to the other agents.

Off their perplexed looks, we

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

One room, bathroom and kitchenette. A laptop computer and

peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a

toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry.

In the main room, there are three large Lazy-Boy easy chairs,

side by side, facing a 27-inch TV on a stand. A cloth covers

two OBJECTS sitting atop the TV.

The door opens. Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam, and Lisa walk in, rigid

with fear. Javal, Beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them

and closes the door. Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt

and wipes his face with it. Mrs. Han realizes he's wired to

the moon... and it terrifies her.

Still holding the Beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the

closet and pulls it on. As the family sits in the chairs:

He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket. He tries

to handcuff Lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists.

She wilts. Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator.

He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth.

He uncovers one of the items atop the TV: An electronic box with

three pairs of oversized, LED VU meters on the front of it.

We NOTICE neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs

up into it. Javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a

green light and the meters come to life.

She looks at her sound meter, which jumped close to the red.

He uncovers the other item atop the TV -- a one-pound brick of

C-4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into

it. Mrs. Han gasps and begins to PANIC.

They nod. Tears roll down Joy's face.

He flips another switch and the green light turns yellow. He

then turns on the TV. COVERAGE of the Summit is everywhere.

Javal turns the channel to a SOAP, and MUTES it. He starts

pacing, and glances at his watch. It's 9:15 AM.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Earl Walther looks through the window as his copter lands on

the lawn behind the North Korean Consulate.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

As the copter lands, Carson comes out to meet Walther.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Carson and Walther come into the house. We hear only the

TICKING of the grandfather clock in the foyer.

Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins,

Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door.

Ambassador Han comes down the stairs, his face tight with

repressed emotion.

Suddenly, the Butler sprints across the foyer. He shoves the

cordless phone into Ambassador Han's hands.

Ambassador Han listens to the phone, then takes in a sharp

breath and sits on the steps.

Carson is elated. Robbins, Sabatini and Dave rush out. Walther

pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial key.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is holding his cell phone next to Mrs. Han's face.

He pulls the phone from her, takes a breath to compose himself.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Javal hangs up. Stunned, Ambassador Han stands up.

As Carson, Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and Walther hurry to

the office in the back of the house, Carson's radio crackles:

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave and Robbins watch Sabatini work the comm console.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Ambassador Han turns on the TV to channel 4.

ANGLE ON TV

It's the same medical SOAP that's on at the apartment -- a

DOCTOR and NURSE are screwing in a deserted operating room.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is standing in the kitchenette, pointing a DIGITAL STILL

CAMERA at the family. It FLASHES as he takes a picture.

CLOSER

There is a cable running from Javal's computer to his cell

phone. He hooks another cable to the digital camera, and an

IMAGE appears on the screen of his laptop. He clicks on "SEND."

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Everyone stares expectantly at the TV. They turn as the fax

machine on the credenza RINGS. An IMAGE begins to emerge from

the machine: the picture from Javal's digital camera.

CLOSE ON FAXED PICTURE

It shows the Han family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs

in front of the TV. The explosives and the electronics are

clearly visible atop the set, as is the program on the TV.

BACK TO SCENE

A second page on the fax begins to come through. As it does,

the telephone RINGS. Carson and Colonel Lee both go for the

extension near the sofa; Carson grabs it first. Ambassador Han

picks up the phone on his desk.

Ambassador Han clicks on the SPEAKERBOX. Carson and the others

look at the second faxed page: a list of instructions.

CLICK. Ambassador Han looks around, feeling totally helpless.

Carson says nothing, trying not to show how uneasy he feels.

Walther glares at Carson, then continues to Ambassador Han:

Numb, Ambassador Han nods.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins, Sabatini and Dave look up as Carson and Walther enter.

Carson is stunned. (OS), we hear a CHOPPER approaching.

Carson shoots a disgusted look at the others, then leaves.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Carson turns off the Beach Boys SONG on the TV behind him.

Holding Javal's faxes, he's facing Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee

and the Hostage Negotiator (whom we don't yet see.)

WIDER

The Negotiator stands and takes the faxes from Carson.

It's Miranda, his wife. Her FBI shield-holder is folded over

the breast pocket of her jacket.

Walther comes in and looks at Carson.

This surprises Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee.

Carson glares coldly at Walther.

Walther looks at Miranda. She nods her assent.

The Americans leave the room.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Still fuming, Carson walks ahead. Miranda pulls Walther aside.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal

turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts

light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other

is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on.

Javal flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of "Lifestyles

of the Rich and Famous." He suppresses a gleeful giggle.

He checks the contents of his prescription bottle. Two pills.

He takes one, stuffs the bottle in his pocket, and leaves.

EXT.  PiY3NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - DAY

SUPER: PiyUngyang. Capitol of North Korea.

Poster city for the charms of Communism: dreary, crumbling,

gray, stifling, hopeless.

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - CONFERENCE CHAMBER - DAY

In the main government offices, a meeting of ten overly-

decorated MILITARY MEN and their SUPPORT STAFFS.

Sour GENERAL KAI (50's) is ARGUING heatedly in KOREAN with an

aged MODERATE GENERAL. The weak-willed PREMIER OF NORTH KOREA

sits up front and listens passively.

An ARMY MAJOR sitting behind General Kai stands and slips out

the door.

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

Crouched behind an air-conditioning unit, the Major, an

American Operative, speaks in UNACCENTED ENGLISH into a small

UPLINK DEVICE, disguised to look like a palmtop computer.

He hears footsteps approaching (OS).

He angles skyward a tiny dish-shaped antenna on the Device. On

its screen it says COMPRESSING... SCRAMBLING... UPLINKING...

After it's finished, the Operative snaps it closed and puts it

into a false bottom in his attachE case. He disappears just

before a GUARD rounds the corner.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

"Welcome Pacific Partners" banners hang everywhere.

WORKERS and CATERERS prepare for the various parties and

events around town. COPS and PRIVATE SECURITY do their best to

keep traffic moving, but it's already getting congested.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave stares at his computer, looking through a DATABASE of

kidnappers and their modus operandi. He rubs his eyes.

She's helping Walther stack packs of THOUSAND-DOLLAR-BILLS

into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when

it's the size of a brick. They then put the individual bags

into two larger bags.

Robbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized HOMING TRANSMITTER in

between two packs of cash. He then hollows out a dime-sized

space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife.

He puts a tiny, SECOND homing transmitter in the space. Carson

checks some hand-held receivers. Miranda crosses to him.

She returns to listening to an AUDIO TAPE:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

During this, Colonel Lee stands in a window on the top floor,

pointing a LASER EAVESDROPPING UNIT at the FBI guardhouse.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Carson looks at her as the thought of it hits him.

EXT.  WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, DC - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The National Security Council: VICE PRESIDENT, SECRETARIES OF

DEFENSE, STATE, CHIEFS of the FBI, CIA and NSA -- sit

nervously around a table, facing a video conferencing setup.

The President, in Air Force One, APPEARS on it.

The SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER refers to his notes.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside, the grandfather clock in the foyer CHIMES THREE TIMES.

Colonel Lee, carrying an AMD-74 machine gun, goes to get in the

driver's side of the second armored Mercedes, but Carson is

already there. Grumbling, he crosses to the passenger's side.

Carson drives off just a moment before Colonel Lee is

completely in the car.

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

The Mercedes crosses Melrose, going into Hollywood. The town

is all done up with posters and banners.

Robbins and Walther follow a block behind the Mercedes in an

unmarked car; Sabatini and Dave drive ahead in Dave's Dodge.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda, Ambassador Han, and Lisa's father (the cussing Jag

Owner) wait by the phone. Miranda smiles reassuringly at the

two nervous fathers. The phone RINGS; she picks it up.

Miranda hands the phone to Ambassador Han.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

From the two-way radio in Carson's pocket:

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

Robbins and Walther are inching along in traffic on Highland

near Hollywood Blvd.

Elsewhere, we see unmarked police and government cars cruising

around, dropping off disguised FOOT-SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS, etc.

A BIKER CLUB

of twenty aging, weekend-warriors, all on custom Harleys, turn

from the Boulevard onto Highland.

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Carson drives the Mercedes into the entrance of the Hollywood

Museum Park. Carson stops in front of a yellow barn with a

sign atop it: "Jesse Lasky Famous Players."

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Still disguised as an ice-cream truck, the van is parked

across Highland by the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl, where a

Summit-related concert is being readied.

Javal watches the Mercedes, and takes his last pill. He's flying.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee grabs the two large plastic bags full of money

from the back seat, opens his door, and drops them onto the

pavement. Carson looks around.

Colonel Lee checks their BEEPING homing receiver. Carson hangs

a left onto Highland, going back the way he came.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave holds their homing receiver. Sabatini, behind the wheel,

smacks his arm and points ahead:

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Javal's van drives into the parking lot, and stops right above

the bags of money.

EXT.  ODIN STREET - DAY

Sabatini and Dave watch Javal's van through the trees.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Javal, sweating and shaking, quickly runs a metal-detector

wand over each of the individual bags of money. One of them

makes the speaker in the wand handle WHINE.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - INCLUDE POV OF DEMILLE BARN - DAY

The van pulls away.

Dave glances at the homing receiver. The signal isn't moving.

He looks up...

Two of the small bags of money are sitting on the pavement.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson hangs a U-turn.

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

At the complex intersection where Highland ends at the 101,

Javal bears to the right, toward the South on-ramp.

Sabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it.

Suddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van

into REVERSE. He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry

drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave.

Peeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes.

The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure

around his van BREAK APART, and the whole thing slides off...

blocking Sabatini's way.

Javal drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101

North on-ramp.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda looks at Ambassador Han and Lisa's father while

anxiously clutching her two-way radio.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson follows Javal onto the freeway. Colonel Lee grabs his

AMD-74 machine gun.

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee leans out and SHOOTS Javal's rear tires out.

The van drives erratically, held in its lane by bumping

against the cars around it.

Carson pulls up closer...

Suddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open...

And Javal flies out, riding a motorcycle. He's got the money

stuffed into two big, chaps-sized SADDLEBAGS slung over the

back of the machine.

He straddles the lanes, going against traffic, riding like a

maniac back the way he came.

Carson watches him in the rear-view... and speeds up, driving

away from him.

But Carson hugs the shoulder, moving through the heavy

traffic, until he spots what he was looking for:

The Biker Club, riding in formation up ahead.

Carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes. He jumps

out and grabs one of the Biker's machines by the handlebars,

wrestling it to a stop. While pulling its BURLY OWNER off it:

Meanwhile, the other BIKERS have come to help their friend.

They pull guns, knives, chains...

They're stopped by Sabatini, who appears holding her MP-5

machine pistol. The Biker yells at Carson as he drives way:

COLONEL LEE

gets in the driver's seat of the Mercedes and turns it around.

JAVAL

continues down the freeway on his bike, straddling lanes,

driving the wrong way, retracing his route back to Highland,

leaving CAR HORNS, CURSING, and COLLISIONS in his wake.

WIDER

When everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another

mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit.

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Javal rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp, then

jumps the divider, runs the light crossing Highland, and gets

into the southbound lanes.

He just misses a BUS, nearly wiping out.

Carson fishes out his two-way.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Listening to the two-way, Miranda tries to follow the action.

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Speeding up, Carson precariously cuts in between traffic.

Seeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli

shotgun from one of the saddlebags. He rests the barrel on his

arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson.

Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST

crosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the

front fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art-

deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl. The statue

shatters into a million FLAMING fragments.

JAVAL

speeds up. A car passing on the right BUMPS him. Javal grabs

for the handlebar to stabilize himself, DROPPING the shotgun.

A HELICOPTER appears, and flies just above him.

Then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a

right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside

neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. The area is

covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter.

Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He

HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.

NEW ANGLE

Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He

can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique,

outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story

concrete tower.

He jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into

the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate.

Javal comes back out, panicking.  He HEARS Carson coming up

the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose.

ANGLE WITH CARSON

as he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle,

abandoned, lying on its side...

And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a

BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead.

Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He

moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.

HIS POV

The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end

of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is

hanging through the broken window.

Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of

the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below.

But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose...

EXT.  HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY

Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her

garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up.

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way

through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin.

Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane.

On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini

and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as

they all try to catch up to Javal.

The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill

below Franklin.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting

him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset.

Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo.

Suddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill.

It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level.

Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta.

Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo.

Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness!

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the

helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with

one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way.

It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then

it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo.

Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners

SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself

against the inside of the Geo's roof.

Snared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly

too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it.

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to

set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere.

The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible

to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading...

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol

Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it.

The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's

heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the

bottom of the hill.

INT.  JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the

glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS.

EXT.  SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY

The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12

floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor

shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like

backwash.

The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner.

CLOSER

From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear

the copter is not going to stay where it is for long.

The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with

fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the

steering wheel to keep from falling out.

ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW

In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse...

anything to get away from the area below the impact.

JAVAL

reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the

seat start to slide toward the open door.

He gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS

again... he loses his grip...

And, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car.

We stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories, SCREAMING...

Then LANDING on top of a parking meter. It RIPS though his

chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD.

EXT.  VINE AND SUNSET - DAY

Carson rushes across the street to Javal's body. The teetering

copter and Geo are right above it.

Grimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the

parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work...

Unable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets.

All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle.

Above, the copter GROANS... it's about to come loose...

Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at

Javal's right wrist, then TEARS the HAND off the body.

With a loud WRENCHING of metal, the copter and Geo break away

from the building.

Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the

street, diving for cover behind a car.

BEHIND CARSON

the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE.

NEW ANGLE

Sooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others.

He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand.

Robbins is still trying to process what just happened.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

The clock reads 3:50 PM. Carson, Miranda, Robbins, Sabatini,

Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee are all TALKING at once.

Carson looks like he's going to explode. Before he can reply:

Carson would love to get into it, but he lets it slide. He

looks Sabatini, wandering aimlessly with Javal's severed hand.

Carson grabs one of the expensive pens from Ambassador Han's

desk, SNAPS it in half, and hands it to her.

In the b.g. she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers

and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper.

Good question. All eyes go to Miranda.

Her head is spinning. She looks at Carson.

He turns to go. Ambassador Han turns to Colonel Lee.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

In the converted attic, several North Korean ESPIONAGE AGENTS

monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote

wiretaps and surveillance units; short-wave, cellular, etc.

Their equipment, being of Chinese and Iranian manufacture, is

hardly cutting-edge technology.

Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are

surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow.

Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones.

Colonel Lee pulls the phones away from him.

Carson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini. The

Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand.

She looks around. Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a

wastepaper basket.

He's also HEARD, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit

by the window. Carson notices, but doesn't comment.

Colonel Lee begrudgingly obliges. Carson dials a phone.

Carson clicks off the phone, then, as he dials another number:

WIDER

Dave comes into the room.

Carson looks at Miranda and hangs up the phone.

Carson tosses Javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to

Miranda. She looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the

dust on her fingertip.

Sabatini looks at them -- which will it be? Miranda frowns and

nods her okay, then spreads the L.A. map out on the table.

He draws a circle on the city map: Beverly Hills to downtown,

Hollywood to Inglewood.

A beat while this sinks in.

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Everyone is smoking. Their tension has increased tenfold since

we last saw them. The President, SEEN through the video setup,

is pacing on Air Force One.

Everyone in the room looks at one another.

Everyone's silence answers his question.

The Intelligence Officer illustrates his explanation with

From up here, it looks like the city is one big block party.

Accordingly, traffic is heavy and unpleasant.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Bobbi looks into the TV camera, dripping with sincerity.

The red light on the camera goes off. Bobbi turns to the Pilot.

The Cameraman and the Pilot sigh at each other.

She takes an industrial-sized bottle of Mylanta out of her

purse. It's fitted with a water-bottle DRINKING SPOUT. She

takes a huge swig and grimaces.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

The Han family sits in their booby-trapped chairs. Joy

carefully turns to her mother.

SUPER: Pacific Ocean. 500 miles west-northwest of Los Angeles.

We FIND a nondescript commercial fishing vessel. Up top, some

Asian "FISHERMEN" crank in and stow their nets.

INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

Coming closer, we see it's actually a disguised North Korean

SPY VESSEL. Several MEN, working under hanging tarps, secure

a 20-foot-long missile launching track to the bow.

Two MISSILE EXPERTS install a green, cone-shaped WARHEAD of

high explosives onto the nose of a 23-foot-long, short-winged

CRUISE MISSILE. They wait for the CAPTAIN's orders...

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Robbins is in Javal's van, examining the innards of the remote-

control boxes. He picks up his radio.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

At the kidnapping site, the intersection is blocked off with

yellow police tape. Several LAPD cruisers are parked nearby.

Some COPS are interviewing the Carpool Lady.

Despite this, the neighborhood's bazaar -- a sidewalk sale

with MUSIC, food vendors, etc. -- has half-heartedly begun.

The government helicopter HOVERS and Carson helps Miranda climb

down a long chain ladder. Colonel Lee follows impatiently.

NEW ANGLE

Carson uncovers the bodies of the Driver and the Motorist,

lying on the sidewalk. He grimaces. Colonel Lee does not.

Miranda wants to look, but Carson drops the cover. She picks

it up, then turns away in horror.

A young BLACK COP crosses to them. He's holding a plastic bag

with a spent shotgun shell in it.

INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The North Korean COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER puts down his

headphones and hurries on deck to the Captain. It's time.

Suddenly, a BEARDED CREWMAN crosses to the Captain. He calmly

SHOOTS him and the FIRST MATE.

The rest of the Crew is shocked. Holding his pistol on the

Crew, the Bearded Crewman nods at the Missile Experts.

Saluting, they remove the green warhead from the missile.

Two OTHER CONSPIRATORS, carrying a metal locker, appear from

below deck. The Crew murmurs nervously as they remove from the

locker a red warhead and attach it to the missile.

Finishing, one of the Experts pushes the firing trigger and

the missile WHOOSHES from its launching pad.

The government helicopter touches down behind the Consulate.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The CIA technicians have enlarged and enhanced every part of

the fax deemed significant, in individual blowups.

BACK TO SCENE

Colonel Lee is standing right beside Carson, leaning over to

look at the pictures. Carson looks at him, irritated.

They're stumped, and bitterly frustrated. To Sabatini:

Meanwhile, Dave and Robbins are calling car alarm shops:

EXT.  PiY3NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - GENERAL KAI'S OFFICE - DAY

General Kai stands in hushed conversation with the Army Major

Operative and another trusted AIDE. The PHONE buzzes; the

others leave the room before General Kai picks it up.

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - OPERATIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

Behind closed doors, the Operative LISTENS to the phone call

with an EAVESDROPPING RECEIVER. What he hears stuns him.

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

The Operative is in his hiding spot with his uplink device.

A GUNSHOT rings out (OS), and the Operative's chest EXPLODES

in blood. He pitches forward... but presses the "transmit"

button on the uplink device before dying.

On screen it says UPLINKING... (without scrambling)... then

another GUNSHOT destroys it.

Angry, General Kai steps INTO FRAME and kicks the Operative

over with his foot.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Mrs. Han and Joy sit motionless. Sam, on the other hand, is

trying not to squirm. Mrs. Han looks at him, angry.

The family becomes aware of a shrill SOUND, (OS), distant at

first, but growing increasingly louder... The sound-level

meters all begin to creep upward...

EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - CLOSE - DAY

A team of GARDENERS has arrived on the property for their

weekly mow, blow, and go. They have lawnmowers, edgers, blowers

-- it's as NOISY as an aircraft carrier during takeoffs.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The SOUND is getting louder, and louder...

The meters are hovering just below the red...

SAM

pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone, no bigger

than a pencil eraser, attached neatly to the headrest.

He begins chewing his wad of GUM... leans in toward the

microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing...

He moves back and we see he's SEALED the front of the mic with

a small piece of the gum.

And his meter drops to zero.

WIDER

Sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he

can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. Then, while

keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his

hand over to Mrs. Han. They can't quite reach each other...

He FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it.

Meanwhile, the NOISE increases. The two meters peak into the

red... the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash...

Mrs. Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half,

and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy.

Joy puts the gum in her mouth. She tries to push it over her

mic, but her hair is in the way. She shakes her head; some

hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the

Gardeners' noise reaches a CRESCENDO...

All three sound meters sit pinned to zero. The yellow light

stops flashing.

Sam, sweating, looks at his mother and sister... and starts

laughing. They join him: a celebration for a small victory.

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DUSK

The clock on the wall reads 7:13, eastern time. The President,

still on Air Force One, APPEARS on the VIDEO LINK. Cut the

tension in the room with a knife? You'd need a chainsaw.

He really doesn't want to be the one telling the President

about this.

The Intelligence Officer looks at the CIA Chief.

The President goes nuts.

The Intelligence Officer demonstrates with another of his

COMPUTER GRAPHICS.

Long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Everyone is painfully on edge. Ambassador Han paces. The FBI

agents are on a phone or a radio, working leads.

Colonel Lee mutters something to Ambassador Han in Korean.

Ambassador Han and Walther keep Carson and Colonel Lee from

going at each other.

She walks away. Carson immediately regrets saying it.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

LAPD cruisers squeeze through the crowded streets, fanning out

through the various parties around town. COPS walk through the

crowds with copies of the picture Javal faxed, and photos of

the Han family and Lisa.

EXT.  SKY OVER PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The red-tipped cruise missile, flying at 550 MPH, 400 feet

above the water, streaks toward its distant target.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Robbins is still working the phone.

He puts the receiver down, hits the speakerbox button and the

mute button. He crosses to Dave's desk to grab some papers.

We can hear the CONVERSATION at the alarm shop:

INT.  AUTO SECURITY SHOP - DAY

A group of young INSTALLERS horse around as they outfit luxury

cars with security systems, high-end audio components, etc.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson rushes over to the phone. To the others in the room:

Carson and Miranda look at each other. Bingo!

NEW ANGLE

One of the Korean Espionage Agents answers a RINGING phone on

Colonel Lee's desk, listens, then hits the hold button.

Carson hurries over, grabs the phone. We SEE him punch the

button for x666.

EXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  FBI SOUND LAB - DAY

EDWARDS, headphones around his neck, sits in front of a wall

of audio analysis equipment.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson hangs up the phone.

Meanwhile, we hear the high-pitched whine as Dave's MODEM

connects with another computer. Dave's fingers fly across the

keyboard, and in a moment, a PICTURE of Javal appears: hair

longer, bearded... but the eyes are unmistakable.

They turn, noticing that Ambassador Han has overheard.

Miranda gives Carson a "your turn to be gracious" look.

Not exactly what Miranda was hoping for. Dave hands Carson a

piece of paper.

Carson and Miranda grab their jackets, then she stops.

Carson looks again at the address...

EXT.  OSAKA, JAPAN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

SUPER: Osaka. Western Japan.

INT.  OSAKA APARTMENT - DAY

In the tiny bedroom of a wheelchair-bound JAPANESE TEENAGER,

computers and HAM RADIO equipment are stacked everywhere.

He turns on a tape recorder. We hear a faint, crackling VOICE:

The Teenager rolls to a computer running CompuServe. He clicks

the CHAT icon, types: "Anyone up on their spy terminology?"

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

With the gardeners gone, and their sound sensors disabled,

Mrs. Han, Joy and Sam are SHOUTING for help.

They listen for a response; it is completely quiet.

EXT.  K-EYE STUDIOS - LANDING PAD - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Just as the government helicopter lands, Bobbi's news copter

lands right next to it.

Bobbi intercepts Carson, Sabatini, Miranda and Colonel Lee on

the pad. Her Cameraman follows, ENG camera on his shoulder,

videotaping everything.

Carson grabs the ENG camera, pops the videotape out of it and

crushes the tape.

Miranda is utterly aghast. She reaches under Carson's jacket

and takes the handcuffs off his shoulder rig. She grabs Bobbi

by the arm and gets her in a half-Nelson.

The STATION MANAGER comes running out of the building.

Bobbi wriggles out of Miranda's grasp. Carson looks at his

wife, who's still fuming, and smiles to himself.

The Station Manager hands Carson the keys to his Lexus.

EXT.  SKY OVER PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The cruise missile makes a slight course adjustment.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

People begin to arrive at the events. BOOSTERS pass out food,

wine and beer... and crank up the Beach Boys TUNES.

Meanwhile, law enforcement cars move into the areas with high

rises -- Century City, Westwood, downtown, etc.

EXT.  U.S. AIR BASE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

A sign on the control tower reads: U.S. Air Force, Okinawa.

Flight Crews direct a squadron of planes out onto the flight

line: F-16 fighter bombers, along with F-15 fighter escorts.

They begin to TAKE OFF...

EXT.  FOUNTAIN AVENUE - DAY

The Lexus is stuck in a dense knot of traffic.

Carson gets out and walks across the hoods of the stopped

vehicles around him -- to much COMPLAINING by their owners --

until he finds the reason for the jam-up:

Along the shoulder of the road, a long line of equipment

trailers and motor homes, cables, lights, rent-a-cops and

gawkers. A MOVIE SHOOT. Carson groans.

He hurries back to the Lexus. Miranda rolls her window down.

Miranda and Colonel Lee immediately get out of the car and run

off, leaving Sabatini to contend with it.

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

A boxy, ten-story complex built in the sixties.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

Carson, (FBI jacket folded over his arm) Miranda, and Colonel

Lee rush into the lobby.

Carson is about to show the CONCIERGE behind the desk his i.d,

but the Concierge is nervous and sweating. Carson pulls out

his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is

ajar... He pushes it open...

And finds himself staring at the muzzles of three M-16 rifles.

Three SWAT TEAM members are standing there in full body armor.

They lower their weapons.

EXT.  ADJACENT APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT team SHARPSHOOTERS crouch on the roof.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Sabatini drives the Lexus in and parks it in the fire lane.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The fire door opens next to an elevator with the number "10"

on it, and Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee come out.

Carson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward

apartment 1060. Carson listens at the door, hears nothing.

He moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly

unlocks the door.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark.

As Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize

there's a WOMAN lying in the bed. She's naked, and she's not

alone. Someone is under the sheets. ANOTHER WOMAN.

The first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs

for a Colt Gold Cup .45 auto in the dresser drawer.

Her friend sits up. Miranda holds her finger to her lips and

shows them her FBI shield.

Carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot-

wide, ornamental balcony.

She begins to protest. He shoots her a look that silences her.

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT sharpshooters watch from the next building over as

Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the

curtains into the window of Javal's apartment.

He swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony... the

bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty...

the balcony SLIPS a little...

He leans on the crank-operated window until it SNAPS open.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson steps inside. He looks around the bedroom -- it's

empty. No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the

pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline.

Carson cautiously goes into the living room --

It's also empty. All that remains are a few cardboard boxes,

and three flower pots in macramE ceiling hangers by the living

room window. Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them.

Carson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The clock on the bedstand reads 4:25. Miranda smiles

uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The elevator DINGS. Sabatini comes out, H&K MP-5 in hand.

SWAT Team #2, standing on the far side of the hallway with

Colonel Lee, sees her machine pistol and takes aim.

Colonel Lee walks over to Sabatini.

Sabatini starts down the hall. Colonel Lee stays where he is.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes. They're empty.

He crosses to the front door, looks it over, unlocks the

deadbolt. He turns the knob, the button POPS open...

He stops, noticing a HAIRLINE SEAM in the doorjamb where a

piece was cut, then neatly replaced.

Then, he's startled as he hears a strange, mechanical whining

NOISE coming from the kitchen.

He goes to investigate -- it's an almost-dead, avocado-green

refrigerator straining to start its compressor. He looks for

booby-traps, opens it, and looks inside. Empty.

Looking down, he notices he's got a dead leaf stuck to the

bottom of his shoe.

Glancing in the living room, he sees the dead leaves on the

floor below the three hanging plants. He looks at the plants:

two are dead. The one in the middle is not. It's plastic.

We HEAR the jiggle of the front doorknob.

Too late... The front door opens....

Carson crouches behind the big, heavy refrigerator door...

As the middle flower pot EXPLODES. It's a shrapnel bomb: it

spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks 360 degrees around room.

Sabatini is HIT full on -- she falls backwards into the hall.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

Miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom SCREAM as the

tacks tear hundreds of HOLES through sections of the wall.

Tiny shafts of LIGHT appear in the wall, except where it is

covered by furniture (keeping them from being shredded.)

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

SWAT Team #2 and Colonel Lee come running, as does Miranda.

Carson is kneeling next to Sabatini. She looks up at him and

tries to say something, but a only long, mournful, final

BREATH escapes her. Agonized, Carson looks around...

And sees Colonel Lee. He lunges for him.

He punches Colonel Lee in the jaw. Colonel Lee slams against

the wall, then comes back at Carson, hitting him in the throat.

Miranda and SWAT Team #2 pull them apart.

He kneels next to Sabatini, and closes her eyes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

It's in between reports. The Cameraman listens to the Grateful

Dead on a BOOM BOX. Bobbi answers her ringing CELL PHONE.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The streets of Hollywood are even more congested than before,

as the festivities really start rockin'.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson and Miranda sit together in the back and Colonel Lee

sits next to the Pilot as they fly back to the Consulate.

Miranda looks at Carson, who's trying real hard not to let

Sabatini's death slow him down.

He glances over at Miranda. After a beat:

Carson looks out the window, not hearing a word she says...

INT./EXT.  BEVERLY THRIFT - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Carson is in the FBI command truck, talking on the phone to:

A BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he

holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and

CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding

a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball.

The OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges.

Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed

to protect themselves...

The front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES.

Carson runs to the bank. He spots the kid's ball, rolling in

the street... BURNING. He turns away, horrified, devastated...

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

He turns away. She takes his hand.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family continues to call for HELP. As they do, we

INT.  HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE APARTMENT - DAY

Their CRIES echo faintly through a deserted tangle of ladders,

construction equipment, sheets of drywall, etc.

A warning sign taped to the wall near the elevator reads:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The mood is glum. Carson looks at Robbins, Dave and Walther,

then at the empty chair where Sabatini had been sitting.

Hearing Beach Boys MUSIC on the TV's and radios on the

surveillance console, Carson angrily punches them all off.

Suddenly, Miranda looks at him:

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Bobbi and the News Cameraman are arguing bitterly:

He sighs and turns the CAMERA on.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY

The Han family listens to Bobbi, amazed, horrified...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The TV's are off -- so they see none of Bobbi's report.

Carson crosses to Dave. He's at his computer, looking at a

long column of telephone numbers.

Dave jumps to the bottom, points at a number.

Dave highlights a number: 213-965-5666.

WIDER

Carson glances over at the telephone on Colonel Lee's desk.

(FLASHBACK) - CLOSE ON PHONE

from when Carson took a call there, pushing the mute button.

(FLASHBACK) - EXTREME CLOSE UP

on the label showing the phone's extension number: "x666."

BACK TO SCENE

Across the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently.

Carson turns to look at him. They make eye contact.

Time stands still.

Realization.

Feeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for

the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster.

Colonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk.

Colonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door.

The BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North

Korean Espionage Agents is HIT. He slams against the console.

Carson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor,

while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction.

Robbins also dives for cover, pushing Walther down first.

Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder.

Miranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk.

Colonel Lee, still FIRING, slips out the door.

Gunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda.

Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them.

Dave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his

notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY.

Carson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet

hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open.

She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is

mushroomed against the vest.

She awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him.

Carson is overwhelmed with relief.

Then he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against

the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head.

OS, we hear several SPURTS of machine gun fire, and a car

ENGINE roaring to life. Miranda looks at Carson...

EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The city's reaction to Bobbi's announcement is immediate and

severe. It makes the panic during the '92 riots look like a

drive in the country.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Carson bursts through the door just as the second armored

Mercedes CRASHES through the wrought-iron entry gates. Carson

fires several SHOTS, which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes.

Carson sprints for a car. Miranda's Volvo is the closest one.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

As Carson is starting it, the passenger door opens and

Ambassador Han gets in.

Ambassador Han responds by putting on his seat belt. Carson

sighs and tears out of the driveway.

EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Colonel Lee crashes through the Fremont Place guard gate, then

hangs a right on Wilshire. He drives the center turn lane,

zooming past the snarl of cars.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

In the back of the Consulate, Miranda, sore as hell, climbs

into the government copter. It WHINES to life and TAKES OFF.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson looks around at the chaos around them.

Then he HEARS, on a nearby car's FM RADIO:

Stunned, Carson looks over at Ambassador Han, who buries his

face in his hands.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Miranda is flying just behind Carson's Volvo. The TRAFFIC is

beyond nightmarish. She smiles at his concern for her.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Sweating, Dave is watching the ACTION outside on a TV while

hurriedly bandaging Robbins' shoulder with some torn cloth. He

grabs for the two-way and we realize he's panicking.

He squeezes his eyes shut... After a long beat:

EXT.  SKY OVER LOS ANGELES - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Several large military helicopters approach -- troop

contingents from Pendleton and Ft. Irwin.

The big CH-54 dual-rotor copters set down and offload MARINES

and ARMY INFANTRY.

Others, like Apache Gunship combat copters and Hueys, begin to

follow the pursuit. They join the police and TV copters, and

it looks like the Ride of the Valkyries.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

People flee from the festivities in droves. Seeing the

helicopters and TROOPS in bio suits only fuels the hysteria.

We hear news REPORTS coming from car radios, boom boxes, TV's.

Reporters chatter urgently in English, Spanish, Japanese,

Korean, Farsi, their voices mixing with the shouts of

pedestrians, the rumbling and horn-blowing of the traffic...

Everyone, everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash

to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones.

This is the mother of all rush hours.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee's car turns right onto Western Avenue. He's in the

heart of Koreatown -- hardly any of the signs are in English.

He swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads --

in the center lane, or into the oncoming traffic. The cars he

HITS crumple against the Mercedes without slowing it down.

Carson's Volvo follows, squeezing through traffic in its wake.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) DAY

Bobbi is salivating with excitement (and antacid.) She snaps

off her mic and yells at her Cameraman:

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Ambassador Han looks glumly at the chaos in the streets.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee gets stuck in a line of cars trying to get onto

the 10 East. Above, a swarm of HELICOPTERS circle him.

INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Marine MAJOR VREELAND and his PILOT sit in the lead

helicopter, an Apache Gunship.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson leans on the HORN and tries to push through traffic.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee sees the Apache helicopter approach. He leans into

the back seat, knocking the top off a long, plastic crate.

INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The SUNROOF on the Mercedes slides open. Colonel Lee's upper

body pokes through the sunroof. He's holding a manportable

S.A.M. -- a 3-foot-long, fiberglass rocket launcher.

Vreeland tries to bring his machine guns to bear on Colonel

Lee, but there's no time...

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee depresses the trigger on the launcher and a

rolling-pin-sized rocket is EXPELLED.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

The rocket SLAMS into a police helicopter just in front of the

Apache, creating a huge FIREBALL, turning the copter into two

tons of red-hot shrapnel.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

Carson and Ambassador Han watch with horror.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

A hundred yards away, they're BUFFETED by the explosion.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The burning hull of the police copter CRASHES into a mini-

mall, causing a FIRE and EXPLOSION.

Hot metal and debris PINGS and POPS as it rains over the

neighborhood, sending cars and pedestrians rushing for cover.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - DAY

Vreeland's Apache and the remaining helicopters scramble away.

The copters set down in parking lots, rooftops, wherever.

Armed troops climb out to keep PANICKED MOBS from swarming

them in an attempt to leave the city.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY

The Han family watches the TV, amazed, as Colonel Lee ducks

back down into the Mercedes and closes the sunroof.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Other drivers, not knowing whether Colonel Lee's rocket is the

biological missile, scatter away from him. Colonel Lee

squeezes onto the freeway on-ramp.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pieces of burning DEBRIS are still landing nearby. Carson

looks at Ambassador Han:

He looks at Han.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave, calmer but still sweating, taps at his computer. A

schematic of Colonel Lee's rocket launcher appears on it.

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Miranda has hitched a ride in a black-and-white.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Several police cars clear a path for two huge, yellow DWP

BULLDOZERS borrowed from a construction cite.

They rumble up onto the eastbound freeway, turn, and then

stop, side by side, facing oncoming traffic. They lower their

huge front shovels to create a roadblock.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - CLOSE - DAY

Bobbi sits impatiently, microphone in hand...

WIDER

The copter has landed behind an AM-PM Minimart/gas station.

Bobbi, her Pilot and her Cameraman turn when they hear a

KNOCKING on the windshield of their copter...

Oblivious to the panic on the streets, a raggedy HOMELESS GUY

stands with a spray bottle, wanting to wash the windows on the

copter. Bobbi gulps some Mylanta and waves him away:

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

All of the celebration locales are trampled, abandoned messes.

So much for "Fun Fun Fun" and L.A. putting on its best.

MOBS make panicked runs on the stock in grocery, drug and

hardware stores. Violence breaks out in the aisles and parking

lots.

PEOPLE in their homes work feverishly to seal their doors and

windows against the plague with tape, towels, plastic.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee screeches to a stop 500 feet from the bulldozers,

angling the Mercedes so the driver's door is facing them.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The windows on the Mercedes glide open....

Carson hurries to catch up to it...

Colonel Lee FIRES a rocket at the bulldozers through the

driver's side window. The BACKBLAST from the launcher vents

through the passenger's side.

The ROCKET impacts the bulldozer on the left; the EXPLOSION

actually FLIPS the huge machine head over tail into the air.

The bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing

a portion of it.

Colonel Lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning

wreckage.

The other drivers really give him wide berth now...

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Approaching downtown, Colonel Lee turns onto the 110 north.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Traffic moves aside for Colonel Lee's notorious Mercedes.

Carson catches up to it.

Carson SLAMS his Volvo into the Mercedes. Ambassador Han

braces himself on the dashboard. Carson looks over at him.

As Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to

allow the barrel of his AMD-74 machine gun to poke through.

Carson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks. Colonel

Lee STRAFES the Volvo.

Carson looks up just in time to see...

A pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder.

Carson slams on the brakes, but it's too late... The Volvo

CRASHES headfirst into the back of the truck.

The Volvo's AIRBAGS deploy, stopping Carson and Ambassador Han

from plowing into the dashboard. After a beat:

Ambassador Han looks at Carson, wondering if he's putting him

on. The car is a twisted mess. Carson can't get the door open.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

A red and white LAFD paramedic's ambulance puts on its SIREN

and hurries to the Volvo. Two PARAMEDICS jump out.

They pry his door open with a crowbar. Carson climbs onto the

roof of his car. Grimacing from pain, he looks around.

The Paramedics pry the passenger door open and help Ambassador

Han out. Carson looks at the ambulance. He's getting an idea...

Carson climbs into the back of the ambulance.

INT.  AMBULANCE - DAY

Carson rummages through the supplies, finds what he's looking

for, and (BELOW FRAME) starts stuffing them into a canvas bag.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Carson climbs onto the roof of the ambulance.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - (VARIOUS ANGLES) - DAY

Everyone in the grounded helicopters -- LAPD, National Guard,

Marines, media -- react to Carson's request as if he's crazy.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - DAY

Bobbi is standing next to her copter in the back of the

minimart, listening to this exchange on a POLICE SCANNER. Her

Cameraman is eating a microwave burrito. Bobbi jumps in, grabs

the ENG camera, and yells at her Pilot:

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

They rapidly cut through the traffic.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Carson waves his arms as he sees a helicopter approaching.

The glare from the sun masks the copter's markings. It HOVERS

above him. With the canvas bag slung over his shoulder, Carson

jumps up onto the runner, then climbs up inside the cockpit.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson closes the door, then sees Bobbi.

EXT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The door opens and Bobbi comes TUMBLING out of it!

WIDER

They're hovering above the roof of a high-rise hotel downtown.

Bobbi lands with a huge SPLASH in the rooftop swimming pool.

BOBBI

surfaces, sputtering and screaming:

Carson replies by tossing her industrial-sized bottle of

Mylanta out after her.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

In the distance, there is smog on the horizon.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

They follow the 110 north. Ahead, Carson sees the Mercedes

cutting across lanes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson has the Pilot hover just above and behind the Mercedes.

It comes to a stop and the sunroof opens up.

Carson lashes himself to the copter's center post with a piece

of the seat harness, then slides the door open.

He reaches into the canvas bag and takes out a road flare. He

breaks the flare open, IGNITING it.

He braces himself on door jamb...

Below, Colonel Lee's head pokes up from the sunroof.

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee calmly aims the rocket launcher and FIRES.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson tosses the lit flare, hard, away from the helicopter.

The Pilot swings the helicopter in the other direction, and

the rocket FOLLOWS the flare, streaking past the helicopter.

A few seconds later, the rocket EXPLODES in midair behind them.

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Miranda sees what Carson is doing.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The News Pilot looks over at Carson.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda and the L.A. Cop, both holding small tear gas pistols,

split up. Crouching behind the cars on the freeway, they sneak

up on the stopped Mercedes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson takes another flare out of the canvas bag. He breaks

the top off... and it doesn't ignite.

Below, Colonel Lee loads another rocket into the launcher...

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda is climbing the metal stairs leading to a graffiti-

covered freeway sign.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson fumbles to pull another flare out of the canvas bag.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Avoiding coils of razor-sharp concertina wire around the sign,

Miranda FIRES a tear gas canister at the Mercedes' sunroof.

It misses, bouncing off the windshield, filling the area with

white smoke. Colonel Lee keeps his eye on the copter...

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson gets the new flare lit and throws it away from the

copter just as Colonel Lee FIRES another rocket.

The rocket EXPLODES a few dozen yards away. Shrapnel PEPPERS

the copter, DAMAGING the rear rotor.

Struggling to maintain control, the Pilot heads for the Sixth

Street on-ramp, below the freeway, out of the line of fire.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee spots Miranda, up on the freeway sign, loading

another tear gas canister. He STRAFES the sign.

She flattens; the BULLETS tear through the sign above her.

The L.A. Cop rushes the Mercedes. Colonel Lee FIRES at him,

hitting him across the legs.

Colonel Lee ducks back into the Mercedes and drives away.

VARIOUS ANGLES

As Miranda comes down from the sign...

Carson climbs up the embankment from Sixth Street to the 101...

The downed L.A. Cop waves as a pair of ambulances drive up,

lights flashing and sirens WAILING.

Carson runs alongside one of the ambulances, pulling the

driver's door open before it's stopped.

The Paramedic is the one who helped him and Ambassador Han out

of the Volvo. Carson yanks him out of his ambulance.

INT.  AMBULANCE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson jumps in. Miranda climbs in the passenger's side. As he

peels away, Miranda smacks Carson on the head.

Carson turns, surprised and annoyed to see Ambassador Han, his

arm bandaged, lying in the cot in the back.

Lights and SIRENS going, they rush into the 110/101 interchange.

Ahead, Colonel Lee's Mercedes is driving through the cars that

are parting like the Red Sea for him.

Carson glances up at the sign showing the upcoming exit:

Glendale Blvd - Echo Park. A thought is forming...

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Carson suddenly cuts to the left. When they reach the Glendale

Blvd exit, he SLAMS the ambulance into the side of the

Mercedes, forcing it onto the freeway off-ramp.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson pushes the Mercedes across Bellevue Avenue, toward the

park surrounding Echo Lake. Colonel Lee STRAFES the ambulance.

EXT.  GLENDALE BLVD - DAY

Carson keeps BUMPING the Mercedes as they reach Glendale Blvd,

running right alongside the lake.

With a hard shove, Carson sends the Mercedes SKIDDING off the

road, through the small guardrail, and INTO the lake.

Carson slams on the brakes, fishtailing the ambulance into the

grass surrounding the lake. Sig 9mm in hand, he hops out.

The Mercedes is so heavy that it's already half-submerged.

INT./EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

WATER pours in from the floorboards, the air vents...

Colonel Lee climbs out through the sunroof and FIRES at Carson

with his AMD-74.

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

Carson ducks behind the ambulance, takes careful aim...

And SHOOTS Colonel Lee, WINGING him in the shoulder. Colonel

Lee's machine gun goes flying, and he tumbles into the water.

Meanwhile, Cops, Army, Marines, etc. arrive via helicopter and

car. Major Vreeland is among them. The news media, ENG cameras

bouncing on their shoulders, run alongside them.

CLOSER

Carson races over to grab Colonel Lee, who is slogging out of

the lake. There is a glint of bright steel... and Colonel Lee

SLASHES at Carson with a knife.

Carson moves aside... but the knife SLICES across his upper

arm. Carson falls backwards.

Colonel Lee, on hands and knees, tries to crawl away. Suddenly,

someone KICKS him in face, flipping him over.

It's Miranda. Colonel Lee's knife goes flying.

Carson, bleeding, piles onto Colonel Lee. Vreeland assists.

Colonel Lee fights like mad to break free...

Until Miranda JAMS her heel into his groin. He cries out.

Surprised at his wife's new negotiating technique, Carson

shoots a look at Vreeland. Vreeland grimaces.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave sits in front of his computer, phone receiver resting on

his shoulder, riveted by the ACTION on the TV.

He turns as his MODEM squawks and another download comes in.

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

While Miranda continues to apply encouragement to Colonel

Lee's gonads, Ambassador Han limps over. He yells some ORDERS

at Colonel Lee. After a moment, Colonel Lee sags.

Carson's not so sure, but they're completely surrounded by

military and law enforcement personnel. He releases his grasp.

Miranda removes her heel.

Then, with lightning reflexes, Colonel Lee grabs Vreeland's

Rock Island Arsenal Colt .45 Auto from its snap-holster.

Carson dives back onto him. But he twists his arm around and

PULLS the trigger -- with the muzzle underneath his own chin.

Carson, Miranda and Ambassador Han are SPRAYED with his blood.

WIDER

Dumbfounded everybody looks at each other...

Carson, dogged, kneels next to Colonel Lee's body and searches

through his pockets, looking for something, anything.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

Ahead, in the distance, the coastline comes into view.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family stares at the TV. Mrs. Han purses her lips...

fighting it... a tear rolls down her face. The time: 4:51.

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

Carson reaches for his two-way radio.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave is looking at the TV, paying no attention to his

computer.

INCLUDE COMPUTER

as some bank records are being downloaded: faxed IMAGES of

processed checks SCROLL down the screen.

Shaking his head, Dave glances at his computer...

CLOSER

Just in time to glimpse the words "First & Last + Deposit" on

one of the checks as it scrolls off the screen.

DAVE

fumbles to scroll back to the check.

EXT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - ANGLE ON WINDOW - DAY

Through the sheer curtains over the window we can SEE the Han

family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs.

We PULL BACK... they're way up in a high-rise building... The

CAMERA continues to PULL BACK, farther and farther...

...REVEALING 4,222 apartment units, on 168 acres. The building

in which the apartment is located is one of 18 identical, 13-

story towers standing side-by-side in a series of hexagons.

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

Vreeland's Apache helicopter LIFTS OFF.

INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave, re-energized, is juggling the phone and the radio.

INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY

The dense Assistant Manager, MILTON, stands in the outer

office, staring at the inner office's closed door.

During this, outside:

INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson sticks the radio in his pocket and looks at Miranda.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The hostages can hear the WHOOPING fire alarms and the (OS)

ANNOUNCEMENT. Joy looks at Mrs. Han, hopeful.

No answer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

Police cars, military vehicles, fire trucks, etc. converge on

the complex from all directions.

Several helicopters circle the complex. One has a PA in it:

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family listens, frustrated, as the HELICOPTERS circle (OS).

Joy carefully slides her arm along the arm rest, then tries to

coax something out of her pocket -- her Zippo lighter.

They look over at her as she lights it. After a beat, Mrs. Han

understands... She hesitates, then:

Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her

foot to Mrs. Han. She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's

sitting closest to the window.

With one eye on the VU movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter,

sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains.

INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY

Several COPS and MARINES burst into the office. Milton, the

Assistant Manager, cowers as they SHOOT the lock off the door

to the inner office and rush in.

They literally tear the office apart.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FIRE is consuming the curtains. Thick, toxic SMOKE begins

to fill the tiny apartment, and everyone starts coughing.

INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

They circle, overwhelmed by the sheer number of apartments.

Miranda points to a wisp of SMOKE above one of the towers.

They come around, and spot the FIRE in the apartment's window.

It is nine stories up, four stories below the top floor.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

The coast looms closer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER - DAY

The Apache hovers parallel to the apartment, 20 feet away.

Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch...

Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick,

iron balcony railing.

Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly

across the line, onto the balcony. Using the butt of his Sig

9mm, he BREAKS a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass

door. He reaches through and unlatches it.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FLAMES have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun

to creep across the floor and the ceiling.

Carson glances over at the electronics on the TV: 4:55 PM.

The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic.

In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her

mouth. She's freaking out.

Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off.

She starts SCREAMING, so he grabs her face.

He grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it

won't come loose. Lisa cries out in frustration.

Carson spots Javal's toolbox. In it, he finds a socket set

handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and

the door. He rips one handle loose, then the other.

Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs.

Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed

hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs

for the front door. Just as she reaches it:

He grabs her before she opens the door. There's a small

magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb.

He looks at the meters on the electronic units.

Carson looks at Sam, impressed, then peers under the chairs.

Carson looks around, thinking. He spots the roll of duct tape

on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece.

He wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight.

They look at each other, scared... After a beat, she does.

The meter JIGGLES... but stays in the black! Everyone sighs

with relief. Carson repeats the process on her other armrest.

Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried

under Mrs. Han's thighs. He runs a long piece of tape around

the seat and wraps it tightly.

He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red.

He wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries

again to lift her. This time it works!

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

The missile has almost reached land.

EXT.  U.S. FIGHTER BOMBERS - SKY OVER SEA OF JAPAN - DAY

Traveling toward the Korean DMZ.

INT./EXT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER -

DAY

Time: 4:58. The Apache helicopter HOVERING outside is making

an incredible racket.

Carson is helping Joy get free of her chair. As she stands,

the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone

head begin to PULL the gum away!

Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow

warning light flashing... She grabs Carson's arm.

Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero.

WIDER

The FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is

hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa

into the rescue harness. She's terrified.

She nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the

harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so

his sister can go.

ANGLE ON BOMB

One minute... fifty-nine seconds...

CARSON

sends Sam across... the harness comes back... he straps Mrs.

Han into it...

He pushes her across. As soon as she's there, he gestures to

the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook.

ANGLE ON BOMB

Thirty seconds... twenty-nine...

THE HARNESS

slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and

tries to undo the hook buckle with the other...

But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he

can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the

hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing.

Fifteen seconds to go...

Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away.

INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Miranda turns to the Pilot.

INT./EXT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER -

DAY

Five seconds to go...

The Apache helicopter backs away from the high-rise...

The cable pulls taut...

Carson wraps the webbing of the harness around his wrist...

The Apache STRAINS against the resistance of the cable...

The entire railing around the balcony BREAKS away, with Carson

HANGING on the harness next to it...

The helicopter turns and flies away...

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

The bomb EXPLODES, blasting a huge hole in the tower.

All the windows in the nearby towers and apartments IMPLODE.

CARSON

is engulfed in the FIREBALL... We can't tell if he's alive.

INT./EXT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The force of the blast HITS them like a tidal wave. The Pilot

fights to keep control while looking for a place to set down.

BELOW

Huge chunks of debris, glass, furniture, etc. rain down.

Carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter

swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast.

Groggy, he loosens his grasp on the harness, and jumps clear

as the helicopter lands.

Miranda leaps out of the Apache and runs to him...

WIDER

Dust and debris from the explosion hang in the air;

helicopters crisscross the scene.

Everyone turns their eyes skyward, looking for the missile...

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - P'YUNGYANG - (INCLUDE TV) -

DAY

The Premier and the High Command are watching the action at

Park LaBrea on CNN Live...

...As Ambassador Han embraces his family.

Furious, General Kai gets up and leaves the conference room.

The others look at the Premier. After a beat, he crosses to a

PANEL OF ELECTRONICS and SLAPS a large red button on it...

EXT.  SKY ABOVE SANTA MONICA - DAY

The cruise missile EXPLODES, completely obliterating it.

EXT.  U.S. FIGHTER BOMBERS - SKY OVER SEA OF JAPAN - DAY

The lead jet cuts away, turning around. The others follow.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

The Han family crosses to Carson, blackened and bloody,

sitting on the curb next to Miranda. Ambassador Han shakes

his hand. Mrs. Han and Miranda cry. Joy and Sam grin at him.

After a beat, Carson gathers the kids up in his arms. It is a

profound catharsis for him...

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - P'YUNGYANG - DAY

General Kai is getting into his car. He look up as an ARMY

OFFICER approaches... and SHOOTS him! The Officer pushes his

body into the passenger's seat, gets in, and drives off.

DARKNESS

and the sound of RUNNING WATER.

EXT.  PASTORAL SCENE - DAY

A beautiful ranch house and horse barn, sitting on a meadow

beside a brook, overlooking an unspoiled pine forest.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The pastoral scene is a COMMERCIAL on the TV.

Carson, wrapped in a towel, holds the phone and paces.

Carson hangs up, and CLICKS off the TV as he leaves the room.

The sound of RUNNING WATER continues (OS)...

EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO - NIGHT

Miranda, wearing a bathrobe, is WATERING her sickly roses.

Carson comes outside.

Miranda smiles, then looks at him, surprised, as he crouches

down and helps her turn the soil around the rose bushes. They

work in silence. Then, tentatively, she leans over and kisses

him. Soon they're in each other's arms, holding tight...

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Still entwined, Carson and Miranda stumble in. While kissing:

He slips her out of her robe and they fall onto the bed. It is

a tender, romantic moment...

Until, (OS), a CAR ALARM goes off. Miranda bolts up.

Carson ignores the ALARM -- and Miranda's comment. He pushes

her back onto the bed and turns off the bedside lamp.

All of the books and magazines about other places to live

spill from his nightstand, onto the floor...
