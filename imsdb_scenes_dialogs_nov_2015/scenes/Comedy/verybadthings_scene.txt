FADE IN:

TITLE SEQUENCE

THE DEAD OF NIGHT

Pitch black. Dead quiet. Dim faint light appears in the

distance, approaching, growing larger. As the light nears,

we recognize car headlights. Closer and closer until the car

is bearing down upon us with great force...

INT. CAR

Two men in the front seat, FISHER and MOORE. Fisher drives.

All seems quite normal until we take a closer look, sweat

matts hair, dirt stains on white tuxedo shirts hands are

blistered and bloody. They seem almost entranced.

SILENCE. PUSH IN ON Fisher...

FISHER'S VISION - GRAINY - OUT OF THE PAST THREE RIVER STADIUM -

DECEMBER 23RD, 1972

Playoff game between the Oakland Raiders and the Pittsburgh

Steelers. Scoreboard reads: 22 seconds, 4th down, 10 yards

to go, 4th quarter.

transfixed...

Bradshaw throws.

Bradshaw throws.

The ball bounces off the helmet of a Raider player and is

caught low by the Steelers' FRANCO HARRIS.

FISHER - DRIVING

Oncoming headlights illuminate Fisher's face...

END TITLES.

FADE IN ON:

INT. LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - MARRIAGE LICENSE DEPT. - DAY

SLOWLY TRACKING down a long line of couples. Some with kids,

some old, some young, all waiting to pay their $55 and pick

up their marriage license.

We HOLD on a young couple, late 20's, KEITH FISHER and his

fiancee, LIZ GARRETY. Fisher has a blondish quality to him,

unassuming, pleasant, attentive, a bit more reactive than he

could be. Liz is quite attractive, but somewhat tense, and

not at all happy about having to stand in this very slow

moving line.

In front of them a middle-aged MEXICAN COUPLE make-out

intensely while their chubby little THREE YEAR OLD stares at

Liz.

Liz pulls a note-pad out of her daypack.

A YOUNG TEENAGE COUPLE behind them stares at Liz, a bit

confused.

EXT. SANTA MONICA

TIGHT ON a "Fred Sands" realty sign being pounded into the

ground. Pictured on the sign, as "offered by," is realtor

DAVID BOYD, 30-ish, short hair, smiling with bizarre

sincerity.

WIDER to reveal, David Boyd in the flesh, suit jacket off,

pounding away, sinking the sign into the front yard of a

cute little house. His CELL PHONE RINGS. Boyd, gets the phone

from his jacket.

ANGLE ON A YOUNG COUPLE, obviously here to see the house.

Bewildered and somewhat intimidated, they back off.

Boyd hangs up, puts on his jacket and turns with the same

bizarre insincere smile in his photo. Hand extended...

FISHER AND LIZ IN LINE

TIGHT ON - CHARLES MOORE

Late twenties, a chef in a very upscale, very busy KITCHEN.

His name, "Moore," is embroidered on his white chef's jacket.

Food orders fly all around as Moore works with a mesmerizing

focus, a poetic sense of purpose, fifteen things going on at

once; he chops, sautes, braises, etc..., in a perfect mute

silence.

FISHER AND LIZ STILL IN LINE

People are staring.

Finally, at the head of the line, Liz steps up to the clerk.

EXT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING

Fisher and Liz emerge, start for the parking lot. Liz stops

to look at Fisher, her eyes well with tears, vulnerable and

apologetic.

FISHER takes her into his arms, pulls her to him, kisses her

hard, for all it's worth.

INT. A LARGE MONEY MANAGEMENT FIRM

Desk after desk after desk of identical men, seemingly

repeating the same task. We find Fisher at one of the desks,

number crunching. At the desk across from Fisher sits...

MICHAEL BRENN, short, compact, with a severe personality

disorder, masquerading as semi-appropriate behavior.

Michael's phone rings.

Fisher looks pale.

ADAM BRENN, Michael's older brother, mid-30's, a bit soft in

the belly, approaches, more or less in charge.

Adam goes.

Fisher's phone RINGS.

INT. KITCHEN

Liz sits at the kitchen table, in a mild panic.

INTERCUT Liz and Fisher.

EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - SANTA MONICA

BOYD, MOORE, FISHER in the middle, MICHAEL and his older

brother, ADAM, all in suits pose in front of Adam's brand

new, state of the art, Chevy Minivan while Adam's very

aggressive wife, LOIS, mired in domestic resentment, focuses

her camera.

Adam's and Lois' kids, Timmy, 8, and Adam Jr., 10, watch

with Liz. (Adam Jr., in leg braces and crutches, suffers

from muscular dystrophy)

Lois clicks off photos of the men.

The guys break. Fisher goes to Liz.

Adam kisses Lois and the kids goodbye. Adam Jr. nearly looses

his balance in the excitement, Adam catches him.

Boyd starts to get in the drivers seat.

Boyd slides over shotgun, cranks the MUSIC. Fisher's the

last one in. He slides the big Minivan door shut and they're

off.

Adam looks in the rearview mirror, Lois, Liz, Timmy wave

goodbye. Adam Jr. waves one of his crutches.

EXT. HWY - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

The minivan cruises east: from Santa Monica; through downtown

Los Angeles; and the City of Industry. At the turn off, a

freeway sign reads; "Las Vegas 385 miles."

overlooking the city. A couple of Tequila bottles on ice, a

glasses in a toast.

The guys smash the bottles together in an explosion of glass

and the golden Tequila.

for position on and around the couch. Tina starts to move,

very sexy.

Michael tokes a joint.

TINA'S DANCE MONTAGE

somehow incorporating a rubber hose.

Michael is mesmerized...

Tina grinds on Fisher's lap, touching her nipples...

Michael's going crazy... He tries to touch her, she slaps

his hand away...

Fisher can't take it anymore...

Tina relents... moves on...

Michael reaches for her leg like a dog in heat.

She passes over him, teasing, tormenting him, and settles

onto Adam's lap.

The guys roar in approval... Michael glowers...

Adam turns bright red as Tina arouses and rides him...

Michael starts to burn...

The guys egg Tina on, she gets off on Adam's shyness, rubs

her breasts in his face...

The guys are howling...

Tina sucks one of Adam's fingers into her mouth...

Michael looks like he's going to explode...

Adam's overwhelmed, he politely bails out...

Michael moves in on Tina. Hesitantly, she leads him into the

master bedroom.

Boyd reaches for the bottle as the beat goes on.

HOTEL SUIT - MONTAGE

Distorted, a bit crooked. MUSIC and DIALOGUE constantly

changing levels. We're not sure who's saying what. We're not

sure of physical geography. The one thing we are sure of is

that MICHAEL is fucking the hell out of Tina in the bathroom.

SERIES OF SHOTS:

MASTER BATHROOM:

BATHROOM:

SUITE:

Fisher, Adam, and Boyd stop brawling, stare down at Moore

covered in glass.

Moore is fine, not even a scratch. The guys break into ROARING

LAUGHTER, completely HYSTERICAL; shaking, roaring, releasing.

TIGHT SHOTS of each HOWLING until...

One by one... they sober up... looking O.C.

TIGHT ON FISHER as his smile slowly fades to confusion, he

stares O.C. at...

MICHAEL

Standing in the door, face ghost white, blood dripping from

his fingers...

INT. BATHROOM

The guys rush in. Stop dead in their tracks.

TINA

On the floor, legs twisted underneath her, lies growing in a

growing puddle of dark blood. SILENCE as the guys stare,

trying to comprehend.

SUITE

Adam moves into the living room, heads for the phone. Boyd

intercepts him. They wrestle for the phone.

A reasonable point. BEAT.

Fisher entering, freaked...

Adam slaps Michael. Moore tries to break it up.

SILENCE.

Fisher wanders back to the bathroom door where Moore is;

they stare down at Tina as the conversation rages in the

b.g.

ON Fisher and Moore.

As Moore moves in, transfixed, to take a closer look...

PAUSE, as the guys digest this point.

Fisher shuffles to a corner, collapses, head in hands.

SILENCE.

BOYD looks around. BEAT. Raises his hand.

He looks at MOORE.

MICHAEL

All eyes on FISHER, no response.

All eyes on ADAM. He takes a while... Finally,

A reasonable question. Boyd thinks. BEAT.

KNOCK KNOCK

The five men stop breathing. Somebody's at the door.

KNOCK KNOCK

Stunned silence. The guys stare at each other in horror.

Boyd races to the door, eyes the peephole.

BOYD'S POV, through the peephole, outside in the hall, a

man. RALPH, early 30's, fairly unassuming.

Adam throws his head in his hands.

Boyd indicates to the guys to be cool.

Boyd turns as the guys freak. Crazed bits of panicked

conversation -- GIBBERISH.

KNOCK KNOCK.

Boyd moves back to the door, slowly, opens it. Ralph steps

in. Takes a good look around.

RALPH'S POV of the fairly destroyed hotel room and five

severely traumatized men.

SILENCE.

PAUSE.

SILENCE. Ralph checks the rest of the guys. Some strange eye

contact. Extremely uncomfortable.

More SILENCE.

He starts for the bathroom.

And Ralph is on his way to the bathroom. And the guys are

freaking as Ralph moves through the bedroom up towards the

bathroom. Hand on door -- opening door -- stepping in -- and

Ralph sees Tina.

RALPH, in shock, staring, back-peddles...

As Ralph starts to turn --

ON BOYD -- his Boy Scout knife raised above his head --

driving it into Ralph's neck!

MAJOR ARTERIAL SPRAY as Ralph's jugular is severed. Ralph

struggles. Boyd wrestles him back toward the bathroom.

And MOORE is there. Helping Boyd wrestle the SCREAMING

thrashing Ralph into the bathroom. Ralph fights like a gilled

Marlin. They shove him into the bathroom. Boyd slams the

door shut. Holds it tight as Ralph tries to force it back

open.

And help they do. Michael, Moore and Adam all hold the door

shut as Ralph continues to fight for his life. Slowly the

force of his POUNDING eases. We hear Ralph slowing down...

The thrashing slows... softer... The MOANS quiet... softer...

Just a slight GURGLE... Ralph is going... going... Ralph is

gone.

AT THE DOOR

Eight hands slowly peel off the bathroom door. Devastating

SILENCE as the guys attempt to process this, the latest of

developments... with Fisher staring, blotto.

INT. THE BATHROOM

The door slowly opens. Boyd first -- then the rest of the

guy's heads slowly appear in the doorway.

And Moore is out the door, racing for a garbage can to relieve

himself.

THE GUYS' POV

An absolute blood bath. The walls are covered with Ralph's

arterial spray. Tina lies, still dead on her side. Ralph has

somehow "assumed the position" dead, head in the bathtub. A

bizarre and gruesome sight. Boyd surveys the carnage, takes

charge.

Fisher's response is to join Moore, as he searches for a

garbage can to puke in. Michael just stares.

INT. WALMART - NIGHT

The boys move down the isles of the massive 24 hour everything

tape, giant pruning shears, etc...

Moore grabs a plastic garbage can off a shelf and pukes in

it for all he's worth.

Adam slowly straightens up a lamp, begins to help.

van is ready.

INTERCUT PHONE CALL

Fisher realizes he's not breathing.

Boyd hangs up the phone, looks at his picture on the realty

INT. ADAM'S MINI-VAN

Adam, ghost white, fumbles for a credit card as the kids go

nuts in the back seat.

A black sedan, looking like an unmarked police car, pulls up

nose-to-nose with them at the pump. TWO MEN in dark suits in

the front look like cops. Adam can't help but notice.

EXT. CAR

Adam slides his card through at the pump and starts filling

his tank as one of the "suits" gets out of the black sedan

and does the same.

Adam and the "suit" make eye-contact.

Adam nods, eyeing his gas pump, willing it to pump faster.

His heart starts to pound, he looks away, sees...

An LAPD police car pull into the station, stops in front of

the mini-mart. TWO COPS inside.

glance at the "suit."

Adam's tank is almost filled. He wants nothing more than to

get out of there...

TRACK with Adam as he walks from the pumping across the

parking lot, past the cop car, his HEART POUNDING...

INT. MINI-MART

Adam quickly searches the candy section for Starburst. He

looks out the window...

ADAM'S POV

The "suit" has finished with the gas but he's not leaving...

He's taking a close look at Adam's van. He seems to be

checking the license plate...

Adam is blocking the aisle. He doesn't notice a YOUNG

UNIFORMED COP trying to get past.

Adam turns, panics, stumbles back, into the candy display

and topples to the ground. ADAM lies flat on his back in a

monster mess of candy.

Adam scrambles to his feet, trying frantically to fix the

major mess -- only making it worse. The IRANIAN STORE CLERK

approaches, pissed.

Startled by his tone, Adam staggers back, into a Gatorade

display, slips and topples to the ground.

Adam scurries out of the Mini-Mart, the Cop watches in

confusion.

Liz is in her robe, none too pleased. Adam Jr. and Timmy sit

in the b.g. at the kitchen table eating cookies and milk.

Fisher kisses Liz and goes.

INT. BAR

Dark, smoky, MUSIC. Michael, Fisher and Moore sit in a corner

booth.

INT. ADAM AND LOIS' HOUSE - NIGHT

TRACKING SHOT down hallway into bedroom where Lois sleeps

peacefully.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Fisher and Michael. Moore, drinking, just listening.

INT. LOIS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Lois' bedroom. As Lois sleeps, Boyd softly enters the room.

Moving in on the sleeping Lois, another couple of steps, he

looms over her, reaches his hand to her throat when, suddenly,

Lois' eyes snap open. Boyd is startled. Lois grabs mace from

her night stand and sprays Boyd in the face. He MOANS,

stumbles back. Lois leaps on him like a shark slamming a

side of beef.

They go down hard on the floor and start fighting like wild

animals.

As Lois sinks her teeth into Boyd's balls.

BACK AT THE BAR

LOIS' BEDROOM

Boyd and Lois are choking the living shit out of each other.

Boyd pulls back, swings with a left, Lois ducks, she swings,

a right cross to Boyds eye. He goes down. She jumps on him.

Choking him like a mad dog. As Boyd struggles for air...

THE BAR

Fisher checks his watch as Michael fumbles with his eighth

shot of Yukon Jack.

Michael's eyes bore into Fisher, like he knows something

Fisher doesn't. Fisher's cell phone RINGS.

INT. LOIS' BEDROOM

TIGHT ON Boyd, eye swelling, scratch marks, hair a crazy

mess.

INTERCUT BOYD AND FISHER

Michael stares at Fisher.

Michael drunkenly nods his head as if can hear the

conversation.

PAN OVER to see Lois, half hanging off the bed, strangled to

death. Boyd won.

EXT. LOIS' HOUSE

Fisher's car pulls up. Boyd is waiting outside. He opens the

back door. Michael is drunk in the back. Fisher and Moore

are up front.

Boyd leads Michael into the house.

INT. CAR

Fisher and Moore wait in silence...

A "POP" resounds from within the house. Moore and Fisher

lock eyes, frozen.

Boyd comes jogging out the front door, hops in the back seat.

Fisher and Moore turn, eyes wide.

Boyd touches the painful scratches on his face.

ON Fisher and Moore in stunned horror...

INT. LAW FIRM

TIGHT ON BARRY MORRIS, mid-40's, attorney.

ANGLE ON

Liz and Fisher, flanked by Adam Jr. and Timmy, eyes wide,

they sit across from the attorney, totally bazooka'd. They

stare in horror at Morris.

PAUSE.

Adam Jr. suddenly slips off his chair, lands flat on his

back, starts struggling to get up. Fisher tries to help Little

Adam up.

Fisher manages to get Adam Jr. back up in his chair. Liz

looks rather horrified.

INT. CAR

Fisher drives, Liz up front, Adam jr. and Timmy in the back.

Everyone is shocked in silence. Fisher looks deathly ill,

like he's about to vomit. He pulls the car over and gets

out.

EXT. FISHER'S CAR

Fisher leans on the trunk, puking. Liz gets out to help him,

he starts crying. Liz is gentle and loving.

The kids watch from the rear view window but can't hear.

Liz marches back to the car, gets in and slams the door.

Fisher just stares in shock.

EXT./INT. CHURCH - FISHER AND LIZ'S WEDDING

It's pouring rain outside.

Shots of guests dashing from their cars to the church.

Fisher's parents with Adam Jr. and Timmy, looking overwhelmed.

Upstairs: Liz and her Bridesmaids help Liz get dressed.

Everyone looks depressed.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT

Fisher and Moore in tuxedos. Boyd enters, shuts the door.

Fisher looks ill.

Moore looks at Fisher.

Moore goes. A long tense BEAT between Fisher and Boyd.

INT. CHURCH

The organ is playing. The guests are seated. Liz and her

father are waiting in the front hall.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - CONT'D

Fisher turns away. BOYD combusts. He leaps on Fisher with a

wild cry.

Boyd and fisher fight like animals; choking, pounding,

mauling, a fight to the death. Fisher is losing, Boyd is

choking the life out of him, killing him. Fisher is going

down, eyes rolling back, he's dying, until...

CRASH. Boyd's head is caved in from behind. REVEAL Liz

wielding a big, heavy crucifix. Boyd slumps to the ground.

Fisher gasps for air. Boyd stirs. Liz beats him repeatedly

with the crucifix until he's dead as a door knob. Fisher is

stunned. Liz tosses the cross. Miraculously, only one perfect

droplet of blood has gotten on her wedding dress. She flicks

it off with her finger.

Liz gathers up her train and marches out. Fisher looks at

Boyd, a bloody dead mess.

THE WEDDING

Fisher joins Moore at the alter. JUDGE TOWER smiles warmly

at Fisher.

Before Moore can ask, the ORGAN begins playing the WEDDING

MARCH. Liz starts down the aisle, escorted by her father,

She smiles radiantly.

Liz's father kisses her and gives her to Fisher. They stand

before the Judge who starts talking. TIGHT ON Fisher. His

head pounding. He hears none of what the Judge says until...

Fisher looks at Moore.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT

Moore opens the closet. Boyd falls out.

INT. CHURCH

Everyone waits patiently. Fisher is sweating. He looks at

Liz who stares straight ahead.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT

Moore rolls Boyd over, checks every pocket, trying not to

get blood on himself.

INT. CHURCH

Moore returns.

He hands the rings to the Judge, at which time, he, she,

Fisher and Liz all see blood on his white shirt cuff. The

Judge looks at Moore. He pulls his jacket sleeve down.

Liz slides the ring on Fisher's finger.

Fisher slides the ring on Liz's finger.

Fisher kisses Liz. They turn to face their guests who applaud.

Liz cries tears of joy.

WEDDING RECEPTION - TENT NEXT TO CHURCH

Liz drinks champagne and talks with her guests.

EXT. CHURCH - REAR

Fisher and Moore load Boyd's body in the trunk of Fisher's

car.

Fisher slams the trunk closed.

WEDDING RECEPTION - MUCH LATER

Only a few guests remain. Fisher's parents watch the boys.

The caterers are cleaning up. Fisher and Liz sit alone.

Fisher and Liz look up at a sweet OLD COUPLE, who talk at

the same time, oblivious to each other.

The Old Couple shuffles away. Fisher watches them go, he

suddenly breaks down, crying...

OFF Fisher...

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Fisher's car blasts past a road sign reading, "Las Vegas,

358 miles."

INT. FISHER'S CAR

Fisher drives, Moore's in the passenger seat. They're still

in their tuxedos. Extreme silence. Fisher, almost in a trance.

SILENCE hangs again.

EXT. DESERT - LATER

Fisher and Moore search for the graves of Tina and Ralph

with flashlights and shovels.

They move into a new area and start poking around. Nothing.

Again they search, prodding into earth with their shovels.

Nothing.

Fisher stops digging, tired, he pauses, shines his light

around until...

Fisher moves to a new spot.

He starts digging in front of the rock. The earth is soft.

Moore and Fisher quickly start to dig, until, finally, Moore's

shovel makes contact.

And they dig some more.

MOORE

in the hole, passing the suitcases up to Fisher.

FISHER

loads the cases into the car.

EXT. NEW BURIAL SITE

The suitcases are unloaded. Fisher and Moore dig a new grave.

Moore's back is to Fisher as he digs.

Fisher is directly above Moore, holding the shovel, looking

down at the back of Moore's head.

Moore looks up to...

FISHER, tears running down his face, the shovel high above

his head, ready to bring it down hard onto Moore's skull.

MOORE confused and then realization... CUT between Fisher

above, poised to strike, Moore below, still and vulnerable.

Their eyes locked for several beats. Finally...

Slowly, Fisher lowers his shovel.

THE GRAVE - LATER

The cases are in the hole with Boyd's body. As Fisher and

Moore re-fill the grave with dirt we...

INT. FISHER'S CAR - HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Fisher drives, Moore rides shotgun, both mean are dirty,

sweaty and tired.

TIGHT ON Fisher, staring deep into the road, a faint smile

creeps on to his face...

THE IMMACULATE RECEPTION

The distorted but definitely recognizable image of Franco

Harris running for his life.

Franco makes it into the Raider end zone.

FISHER

Lost in his reverie, wakes up in a hair pin turn. The

speedometer reads 80. They run out of road. The car skids on

the shoulder, Fisher cranks the wheel, jumps the divider,

into oncoming headlights. Fisher and Moore lit up bright...

HIGHWAY

Fisher's car SMASHES head-on into another car. IN SLOW MOTION

Fisher and Moore are launched through the windshield in an

IMPLOSION of glass and steel, flesh and blood.

We hear the sounds of SCRUBBING.

SLOW FADE UP:

INT. FISHER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

TIGHT ON Liz, on her hands and knees, scrubbing around the

toilet of what is clearly a filthy kids bathroom; soiled

jockey shorts, Tonka trucks, mess everywhere.

O.S. we hear voices outside. Liz gets up off her knees,

brushes a piece of hair from her sweaty face and peers out

the bathroom window.

TIGHT ON FISHER

EXT. BACK YARD

Adam Jr. and Timmy, in ill-fitted Cub Scout uniforms, recite

the "Scout Laws."

Timmy snaps out a fine salute. Adam balances on one crutch

to salute but looses balance and falls flat on his face. He

starts SCREAMING.

REVEAL Fisher, in a wheelchair, both legs amputated above

the knee. He leans over, trying to help Adam Jr. up and his

wheel chair tips over. Fisher falls on top of Adam Jr. who

SCREAMS even louder, flailing arms and legs like a turtle on

its back.

REVEAL Moore, in an electric wheel chair he operated with a

mouthpiece. As he is paralyzed from the neck down, he's no

help at all. Timmy suddenly snaps.

THE BATHROOM WINDOW

Liz watches the pathetic chaos that is her life with the

dull lifeless eyes of a concentration camp prisoner.

TIGHT ON Liz as her mouth slowly opens in an anguished SILENT

SCREAM.

OUT THE WINDOW - DOWN IN THE BACK YARD

Adam Jr. gets back on his feet, with the begrudging help of

Timmy. As Fisher struggles to hoist himself up, back in his

wheelchair...

Suddenly, O.S. from the bathroom, Liz WAILS. Fisher looks up

at the window... LONG BEAT...

The boys recite the "Scout's Oath" as Liz's deep, heaving,

wailing SOBS grow in intensity O.C.

SLOWLY PULL OFF Fisher, Moore and the kids...

CRANE UP, past Liz at the window, out of the yard, over the

house, WIDER to reveal the surrounding track-like homes,

housing track-like families, with track-like nightmares as

Liz's plaintiff wails echo the communal despair of the human

village.
