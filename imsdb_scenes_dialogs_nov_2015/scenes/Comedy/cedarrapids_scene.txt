FADE IN ON:

A SHODDILY PRODUCED TV COMMERCIAL

The ad depicts videotaped scenes from Wisconsin's north

country-- a farmer and a cow, a woman waterskiing, a guy

mowing his lawn. A flat, nasally V.O. accompanies the images.

The ad wipes to an inappropriately gruesome photo of an

obviously fatal car wreck. The NARRATOR is chroma-keyed over

the image. He is ROGER LEMKE, 40, blandly charismatic, with a

blonde moustache that evokes a low-rent Tom Selleck.

The car accident photo dissolves into a sunset. The treacly

music crescendos and we:

INT. NORTHLANDS INSURANCE - DAY

The ad has been playing on a 13-inch TV in a small, wood-

paneled office. A handful of EMPLOYEES and FAMILY MEMBERS

applaud wildly. The proud owner of Northlands, BILL KROGSTAD,

60, embraces the man of the hour, Roger Lemke.

Aroo-aroo! Two Diamonds! Two Diamonds!

The men roughhouse playfully. Roger's comely wife, GWEN, 30,

holding their milk-fed TWIN TODDLERS, gives Roger a kiss.

More laughter and backslapping. After a bit, an as yet unseen

MAN hesitantly approaches. He gently touches Roger's arm, not

wanting to interrupt the revelry. Roger turns.

Despite appearances to the contrary, this is our hero: TIM

LIPPE (pronounced Lippy), 34, wholesome and positive, though

undercurrents of desperation lurk just behind his kind eyes.

A FEMALE CO-WORKER interrupts, accosts Roger and ignores Tim.

Tim goes to the cake table. He smiles at the cake, impressed.

The icing on the cake, a frosted visage of Roger Lemke,

smiles back.

INT./EXT. TIM'S CAR - DAY (LATE WINTER)

A beige Buick Skylark splashes through a puddle of snow melt

in the glum, isolated hamlet of Brown Valley, WI (pop: 337).

Tim bops his head and sings along as a Parliament song plays

on a Good Times, Great Oldies radio station. A dour OLD LADY

shoveling her driveway stares as he passes by.

EXT. TIM'S HOUSE - DAY

The Skylark pulls into the driveway of a tidy umber-colored

rambler with a nature scene painted on the garage door.

INT. TIM'S KITCHEN - DAY

Flowered wallpaper. Vinyl flooring. A spoon collection. The

room looks like someone's grandmother designed it. Tim enters.

He opens the fridge, grabs an A & W Root Beer. He opens a

cupboard, removes a box of Hostess Cupcakes. He sits at the

Formica kitchen table, meticulously eats the cupcake, sips the

soda pop and stares out the window at a bird feeder.

INT. TIM'S BEDROOM - LATER

Tim's bedroom looks like that of a fastidious teenager. Twin

bed. Orderly desk. Milwaukee Brewers poster (circa 1987).

Tim removes his penny loafers, pleated khakis and Northlands

Insurance polo shirt. He puts on a different pair of pleated

khakis, a maroon turtleneck and some Top-siders.

INT. TIM'S SECOND BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Tim enters another bedroom. This one has a four-poster bed--

clearly a parents room, clearly unused. He opens the closet.

A label reads GIFT CLOSET!!! Each shelf is neatly organized:

Toys, knickknacks, occasion-specific greeting cards. He

selects a Get Well card and a Beanie Baby duck, Quackers.

A doorbell RINGS. Tim hurriedly signs the card. He licks the

envelope as he hustles to the door.

INT. TIM'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Tim opens the door to MILLIE VANDERHEI, 54, a thick,

depressive woman dressed like a 7th grade science teacher.

Tim pulls the card and Beanie Baby duck from behind his back.

Millie sits on Tim's paisley sofa. She opens the card. On the

front: a Rottweiler in a nurse's outfit. Inside: "Get Well or

You Deal with Me!" Then in Tim's writing, "Love, Tim."

She nods somberly. They sit there silently for a bit. Then:

They exchange a look...

INT. TIM'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

Millie rides Tim. Tim palms her breasts. He still has on the

maroon turtleneck. And one brown sock. Their bodies make a

sound like two soft, thick hands apathetically applauding:

Clap-pfft, clop-pfft, clap-ffft.

The twin bed squeaks disapprovingly.

She waggles her hips with a bit more gusto. He grimaces.

Tim exhales. Millie exhales. That worked out well.

INT. TIM'S REC ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Millie and Tim watch American Idol. A WOMAN sings Queen's

YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND. Tim harmonizes.

The song ends. They sit quietly for a bit.

A beat, then Millie removes a cruise brochure from her purse.

He avoids eye contact. Millie takes Tim's chin in her hands,

forcing him to look at her.

Tim looks away again, pouting. Millie gives him a motherly

hug. Over her shoulder, Tim watches a TEENAGER belting out

QUE SERA, SERA on American Idol. Then, almost inaudibly:

IN BLACK, a phone RINGS.

INT. TIM'S BEDROOM - THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Tim sleeps alone in his twin bed. The phone rings again. Tim

wakes with a start. He flips on the lamp, picks up the phone:

A look of profound anguish appears on Tim's face.

The sound of a church organ playing ON EAGLES WINGS fades in.

INT. ST. ANSGAR'S LUTHERAN CHURCH - DAY

In back of a packed church, Millie whispers with WADE BRODT,

60, a bald, bullet-shaped man. The conversation is discreet.

CLOSE ON ROGER LEMKE'S CASKET

Roger Lemke looks peaceful in death, although it's hard to

miss the marks on his neck left behind by the belt. Tim is at

the front of a long line of uneasy MOURNERS. Tim holds back

tears as he gently touches the marks on Lemke's neck.

Tim steps aside to greet the widow Gwen Lemke in a receiving

line. The grief has left her gaunt. She appears medicated.

He is interrupted by Bill Krogstad's sobs. Tim reaches out to

put a comforting hand on Gwen's shoulder, but somehow ends up

touching her breast instead. A moment.

Tim nods sadly as he removes his hand. He walks away.

INT. NORTHLANDS INSURANCE - DAY

The drab office is brightened with week-old funeral flowers

and flaccid mylar sympathy balloons.

Tim sits across from a young couple, KURT & PAM GAMBSKY, 20s,

in a small, glassed-in conference room. The couple is tense.

The Gambskys smile, comforted. Tim is good at his job.

Tim glances up and sees Bill Krogstad staring longingly at

Northlands' three TWO DIAMOND Award plaques. A beat, then

Krogstad SLAMS HIS FIST THROUGH THE WOOD PANELED WALL! The

couple reels around upon hearing the sound.

Tim exits the conference room and approaches Krogstad, whose

hand is now bleeding.

Krogstad chokes up. His grief is very real. So is Tim's.

Krogstad hands Tim a Manila folder (bloodying it in the

process). Tim gestures for his customers to hold tight. Tim

opens the folder, reading aloud from a cover page.

Tim is really starting to panic.

Tim considers the gravity of this moment.

Krogstad starts crying again. He hugs Tim, his bloody hand

staining Tim's canary yellow V-neck sweater. Tim looks up to

see the Gambskys in the conference room staring at him.

A melancholic yet uplifting song (Leonard Cohen's HALLELUJAH,

perhaps) plays as:

- Tim puts birdseed in his backyard feeder. He looks at the

barren trees as he considers his fate.

- Tim Googles "Cedar Rapids." He looks at photos, crime

statistics, a Chamber of Commerce Youtube video. He closes

his eyes, exhales.

- Tim practices the presentation in front of a mirror. He

works late. He types. He Power Points. Krogstad critiques.

- Tim laminates maps of Cedar Rapids and area attractions.

- Tim pulls a dusty American Tourister suitcase from the

attic. It looks about 40 years old. He packs.

INT./EXT. TIM'S BUICK SKYLARK - MORNING

Tim looks pensive as he drives. He's wearing a new suit. It's

a little too big. A greeting card and a Beanie Baby Rooster

bounce along on the passenger's seat.

Tim pulls up to a SPLIT-LEVEL HOUSE. A pick-up truck with the

words Brodt Heating & Cooling is parked in the driveway.

INT. MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Tim pokes his head into a living room, surprised to see Wade,

the 60-ish bald guy from church, reclining on a Lazy Boy.

Wade's boots are off. His socks are dirty. He's watching ESPN

on a TV with an Olan-Mills portrait of Tim & Millie atop it.

Millie enters in a terry cloth robe. A Yorkshire Terrier

follows her. Millie acts nonchalant. So does the dog.

He displays the Beanie Baby and the card. She takes them with

a cold smile. Tim notices an identical stuffed rooster on an

oak bookshelf-- home to over 155 other Beanie Babies.

Tim tries to proceed as if Wade weren't sitting there.

Tim shoots Wade a look.

He hugs her. Millie melts just a little, yet remains stern.

She fidgets with his tie. A bitter tear skulks down her cheek.

Tim kisses the warm tears from Millie's ruddy cheeks. Millie

licks her finger and smooths Tim's cowlick. Wade just sits

there watching.

EXT. RHINELANDER, WI REGIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

Tim walks up to the tiny municipal airport. He tries the

door. It's locked. A RETARDED MAN shoveling snow spots Tim.

The retarded man nods vacantly and goes back to shoveling.

INT. RHINELANDER, WI REGIONAL AIRPORT - LATER

Tim is the first (and only) person in the security line. An

apathetic TSA AGENT awaits him. Tim has a nervous energy.

Bill Krogstad runs up to Tim. He's out of breath.

Krogstad puts his hands on his knees, takes a few deep

breaths. Then he hands Tim a detailed handwritten checklist.

Tim glances at the list, reads the only name under AVOID.

By Ziegler's name, Tim frantically writes, "Poacher" and

"Armbruster--" making sure not to forget the umlaut.

Tim untucks his shirt, revealing a zippered cummerbund-like

money belt.

High praise indeed. Tim hesitates. Is now the right time?

Tim swallows hard. Bill brings it in for a hug and inhales

Tim's hair.

INT. PLANE - DAY

Tim has a window seat. He reads the safety card. He's sweaty,

anxious. A vaguely swarthy MAN (Indian? Italian? Hard to

tell.), 40s, sits next to him. A perky FLIGHT ATTENDANT

approaches.

The man smiles nonchalantly. Tim tries to play it cool.

The flight attendant smiles politely, if confusedly.

THE PLANE TAKES OFF

Tim looks out the window, watching nervously as the dairy

farms and frozen lakes of northern Wisconsin recede. He

instinctively turns to his neighbor.

They shake hands.

David Marinakis nods, goes back to his book, seemingly

shutting down the conversation. Tim settles in.

THE PLANE LANDS --

Tim hesitates before stepping onto the jetway-- one small

step for man-- and just like that, he's in IOWA!

INT. CEDAR RAPIDS AIRPORT, BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY

Tim helps David Marinakis take his bag off the carousel.

Tim hands David his card, who takes it with a genuine smile.

David exits. Tim stands there waving.

EXT. CEDAR RAPIDS AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE - DAY

Tim emerges from an elevator on the roof of a parking garage.

He inhales the chilly Iowa air. He glances at his rental

agreement and spots his car, a red Chevy Cobalt.

As he approaches the car, he stops. He chuckles, in awe.

In the distance, the Cedar Rapids skyline looms-- its tallest

building, the Alliant Tower stretching 21 stories into the

cloudy sky. Tim snaps a photo with his cell phone.

EXT. HOLIDAY INN HOLIDOME - DAY

The Holidome sign reads, Welcome ASMI `09 Participants!!! Tim

gets out of the rental car. He looks around-- not too shabby.

But upon spotting a SIKH CABBIE in a turban, Tim straightens

up and cautiously adjusts his money cummerbund.

As he walks toward the entrance, a pretty but gaunt young

woman in a short denim skirt, BREE, 22, approaches him.

They shake hands.

People are so friendly. Tim enters the hotel.

INT. HOLIDAY INN HOLIDOME - DAY

Tim walks in. He strolls atop the velvety green carpet, past

a fountain, beneath a golden-colored chandelier and makes his

way to the front desk-- blown away. An apple-cheeked clerk,

whose name tag reads TRENT, greets him.

Tim eyes Trent cautiously as he unzips his cummerbund/money

belt. He removes a credit card and reluctantly hands it over.

INT. HOLIDAY INN HOLIDOME, HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Cell phone to his ear, Tim struggles with his bag as he walks

to his room.

He examines the card key. He slides it in. It doesn't work.

Tries again. Doesn't work. Each time he fails, it beeps.

Suddenly, the door opens. And standing before Tim is a BLACK

MAN. Tim gasps, drops his suitcase, backs away.

Tim turns back and smiles, frightened. The man looks confused.

Tim just smiles a wide, deer-in-headlights smile.

RONALD WILKES, 45, is conservative in dress and demeanor.

Tim clicks off his phone, just stares at Ronald.

Tim laughs loudly. Ronald just looks at Tim. A beat.

Tim shakes Ronald's hand, holds onto it for at least two

seconds too long.

INT. JUNIOR SUITE - CONTINUOUS

Ronald leads Tim into the room, a junior suite with two beds,

a kitchenette and a couch in the separate living room area.

Ronald has undoubtedly been called a nerd more than once. To

Tim, however, he is the embodiment of cool and hilarity.

Tim is giddy like a kid away at camp for the first time.

INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

A pair of massive, scuffed wing-tips walk determinedly down

the hall. We don't see the man they belong to, but we most

definitely hear him as he passes various CONVENTION GOERS.

A booming laugh follows as the feet continue down the hall.

INT. JUNIOR SUITE - CONTINUOUS

Tim admires Ronald's laptop. The screen saver is a photo of a

billboard advertising Ronald Wilkes Insurance. A picture of a

stoic-looking Ronald is the centerpiece of the billboard

along with the slogan, Your Insurance Professional.

The door bursts open. We boom up from the scuffed wing-tips

to reveal DEAN ZIEGLER, 45, whose massive personality just

barely hides an undercurrent of sadness and insecurity.

Ronald deflates upon seeing Dean. He clearly knows him.

Dean gives Ronald a bear hug, lifts him off the ground.

Tim looks like someone deciding which direction to run from

an oncoming tornado. Dean notices Tim's look.

Tim discreetly looks at the checklist Krogstad gave him.

Under AVOID, it says DEAN ZIEGLER.

All three nod. A moment of solemn silence. Then:

Tim stands there slack-jawed-- this man is evil.

Tim and Ronald exit. Dean can't handle the momentary silence.

As he lugs his suitcase into the bedroom:

INT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - DAY

ORIN HELGESSON, 69, a gentle, avuncular man with a Mr. Rogers

persona, addresses a crowd. A banner reading ASMI `09: Let's

Build a Bridge to the 22nd Century! hangs above the podium.

Polite laughter from the 60 or so mostly male INSURANCE

WORKERS congregated in the Sunset Terrace Ballroom, which has

neither a terrace nor a window through which to view a sunset.

MIKE PYLE, 35, a round, milky-skinned man who favors sweater

vests, raises his hand. He's seated near Tim and Ronald.

Orin continues O.S. but we stay with Tim and Ronald.

Tim looks deeply concerned. Back on Orin.

Tim eyes go wide-- Did he say over 15 agencies?!

Tim looks at Mike Pyle, the bland-looking man in the sweater

vest. Tim's confidence is waning. Back on Orin:

Orin places a 4 x 6 foot poster of Roger Lemke on an easel. A

period of mournful reflection follows. Until Orin breaks out

in song-- WERE YOU THERE?, a somber hymn.

Tim looks around nervously as the entire room joins in song.

INT. HOLIDAY INN HOLIDOME, HALLWAY - A SHORT WHILE LATER

Tim paces, cell phone to his ear.

A man's voice picks up on the other end.

Tim shuts his eyes for a moment-- be strong. Be strong.

INT. HOLIDOME FITNESS CENTER - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

Tim, in shorts, tube socks and a very old Milwaukee Bucks

tank top, reads the diagram for the chest press machine. He

gives it a try, lifting about 50 pounds. The only other

person in the room is a WOMAN, 37, on a treadmill.

Tim glances her way, and by chance they make eye contact in

the mirror. She smirks. He immediately looks at the floor. We

stay on Tim, lifting weights, eyes to the ground. But we hear

the treadmill stop. Finally, Tim looks up to find:

Mortified, Tim drops the weights. They crash to their base.

The woman can't keep it in. She starts laughing.

JOAN OSTROWSKI-FOX, middle-management sexy, if slightly too

tan, puts out her hand. Tim shakes it.

Whoa. Tim is taken aback by this. Joan notices Tim's outfit.

Tim reddens, once again going into panic mode. Joan laughs.

Tim tries to think of something clever to say, but just sits

there with his mouth open. He's never met a woman like this.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

Tim finishes showering. He steps out of the shower to find

Orin Helgesson, completely naked. Orin has just exited

another shower. He smiles pleasantly at Tim, also naked.

A flash of emotion-- maybe even anxiety-- on Orin's face.

Orin puts a supportive hand on Tim's shoulder.

Orin gives Tim a hug. Tim juts his butt out so that their

penises don't touch. A JANITOR enters the locker room, sees

this odd embrace, pauses a beat and hurriedly exits.

The embrace runs its course. Tim isn't sure where to look.

Tim shakes his head, disbelieving.

Orin goes to his locker, removes a folder.

Tim accepts the stack of drink tickets. He's scared shitless.

INT. HORIZONS BAR & GRILLE - NIGHT

Tim, with taupe turtleneck tucked in to pleated corduroys,

hesitates at the threshold of Horizons, a brightly lit,

aeronautically-themed establishment. The cavernous bar is

largely empty. Tim considers his drink coupons.

Dean sits alone at the bar. Tim reluctantly goes to him.

Dean nudges Tim and laughs as the BARTENDER, 25, approaches.

Tim shudders. Dean gestures for Tim to act natural as Ronald

enters with a taciturn Latino man, BILL HERNANDEZ.

Lubricated INSURANCE WORKERS are now singing karaoke. Orin

and Mike Pyle, the sweater vest guy, sit at a table in back.

Orin looks at Tim with concern as Dean regales him.

Tim displays a photo of Millie (a portrait from the junior

high where she teaches) in his wallet.

Taco Bill sighs and wanders off to get a drink.

It's a weird moment. Dean takes a drink, laughs it off.

Dean raises his drink heroically. No one else joins him.

As fate-- that wily minx-- would have it...

It's Joan Ostrowski-Fox, the woman Tim met in the gym. Dean

and Ronald get up, greet her warmly. Tim looks at his soda.

Joan does an ironic, flirtatious curtsy.

Ronald giggles, more animated than we've seen him.

They laugh. Tim stares ahead, wishing for invisibility.

Tim turns around, acts like he just now recognizes Joan.

The peer pressure! Tim scans the liquor behind the bar,

settles on a bottle that looks impressive.

SHOT POUNDING - MOMENTS LATER

Joan, Ronald and Dean wince as they slam their shots. Tim

sips the thick red syrup, surprised by its sweetness.

Joan squeezes Tim's thigh. Tim bolts off of his stool.

Tim awkwardly leaves the bar. Dean nudges Joan.

As Tim hurries out of the bar, Bree, the woman in the denim

skirt who Tim met outside enters. She's locking arms with a

stout INSURER, 49. Tim pauses long enough to say hi.

With that, Tim is gone...

INT. MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Millie is on the phone in her bathrobe. Her dog sits with her.

Wade is still there watching TV. He's drinking a beer.

INT. JUNIOR SUITE - CONTINUOUS

Tim sits on a roll-away bed in his pajamas. He's on his cell.

A beat of silence. Tim looks irritated.

Tim hangs up, world-weary.

INT. JUNIOR SUITE BATHROOM - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

Tim sits on the toilet. His laptop sits on the counter, the

Two Diamond presentation on the screen. He practices for the

full-length mirror on back of the bathroom door.

The bathroom door opens. It's Deanzie. Tim shrieks.

INT. STAIRWELL - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

Deanzie sips from a mini-bar bottle of rum as Tim, now in a

flannel bathrobe and slippers, enters the dingy stairwell.

Dean sits heavily on the cement stairs. He hiccups, burps.

Tim looks at Dean with a feeling that borders pity.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

Tim lets this sink in. Dean hiccups and burps again.

What? That's impossible.

Tim looks shell-shocked. What a long, long day it's been.

A SERIES OF SHOTS -- AS SLUMBER OVERTAKES THE HOLIDOME

- IN JOAN OSTROWSKI-FOX'S ROOM: Joan is bent over her tub,

applying a Clairol Nice `N' Easy home hair color kit. She

gets up, puts on a shower cap . She applies cold cream to her

face. She looks tired and decidedly middle-aged.

- IN THE HALLWAY: Bree drunkenly escorts a different INSURER

back to his room.

- IN THE JUNIOR SUITE BEDROOM: Ronald sleeps soundly, gently

snoring. Tim tosses and turns in his cot. He looks out into

the living room where he sees:

Deanzie at the desk chair, gently masturbating. We move in to

see what he's looking at: A photo of a woman in a bikini.

She's attractive enough, carrying a few too many pounds.

Certainly no supermodel. Pull out to reveal:

The woman is the subject of a Christmas photo card. The typed

script reads, Happy Holidays from Dean & Patti Ziegler.

Christmas `93, Panama City Beach, FLA.

Next to the woman stands a younger, slimmer Deanzie.

INT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

Tim holds hands with Ronald and a DOUGHY MAN at a round table

in a room full of people holding hands. Orin says a prayer.

Amen. The gathered INSURERS head to the breakfast buffet.

Orin catches Tim's eye, gives him a friendly wink. Just then,

Tim's phone rings. He looks at the caller ID.

INT./EXT. BILL KROGSTAD'S BUICK LESABRE - DAY

Bill Krogstad talks on the phone as he drives. His wife,

DIONE, crochets in the passenger's seat.

INT. HOLIDOME LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Tim tries to get a word in.

INT. BILL KROGSTAD'S LESABRE - CONTINUOUS

Krogstad punches the car roof.

INT. HOLIDOME LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Tim deflates, actually fighting back tears.

Krogstad hangs up. Rattled, Tim hurries for the exit. He gets

in the revolving door when he spots Joan Ostrowski-Fox

outside having a cigarette. Rather than face her, Tim keeps

going in the revolving door. But she sees him and waves.

EXT. HOLIDOME - CONTINUOUS

Tim does one more turn in the revolving door and steps out.

Tim just shakes his head, unable to hide his despondence.

Joan gives him a kind, gentle smile.

EXT. CEDAR RAPIDS PARK - DAY (A LITTLE WHILE LATER)

Tim and Joan swing on a swing set in a dreary little park

overlooking the Cedar River. It is a cold, gray day.

Tim jumps off the swing, taking care not to slip in the snow.

Joan jumps off. They walk toward the river, silent for a bit.

He laughs, sufficiently cheered up. She snaps her fingers and

starts heading back.

INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - DAY

Dean and Orin argue. Ronald tries to stay out of it.

That deflates the tension. The three men are laughing as Tim

approaches. Dean spots him first.

Tim freezes, looks at Orin.

Orin walks away.

Dean and Ronald watch curiously as Tim practically runs away.

INT. MEETING ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING

Tim, Ronald and Joan sit on folding chairs in the front row.

Mike Pyle, his creamy skin offset by an aquamarine sweater

vest, speaks with subdued energy to the half-full room.

The room busts up laughing. Tim takes notes.

Mike Pyle pauses as a HOTEL CLERK enters, whispers something

to him and hands him a note. Mike reads the note.

Tim looks concerned as he rises.

INT. HOLIDOME FRONT DESK - MOMENTS LATER

Tim takes the phone from the DESK CLERK.

Tim's stomach drops.

Whip pan to reveal Dean on another house phone.

Tim turns, sees Dean. A torrent of anger rises. Tim charges

at Dean. He shoves him. Dean is a much larger man and is

therefore impervious to Tim's inelegant, girlish assault.

Despite the low-key nature of the melee, it draws the

attention of Trent, the desk clerk.

Tim deflates. He gives Dean one more shove. Dean laughs.

Tim walks away. Dean calls after him.

INT. JUNIOR SUITE - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

Tim sits on his cot. He is on his cell phone.

He hangs up. He exhales. He looks out the window: An

Applebee's. A Super Target. Traffic on the distant interstate.

Something is bubbling in Tim-- maybe not cauldron of lava;

more like a cup of soup left in the microwave a bit too long.

But still, there's a boiling, churning glow behind his eyes.

INT. NOTTINGHAM BANQUET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Tim determinedly enters a banquet room where VENDORS have set

up booths. He approaches a WOMAN at a table with a sign that

says Met Life Scavenger Hunt!

INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY (OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM) - DAY

Ronald and Joan exit the Seminar. They spot Tim.

Joan looks down at her blouse. Tim flicks her chin.

A few PEOPLE look curiously at Joan. Tim stands up a bit

straighter. This is good. This is good.

INT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Orin, in a theme-appropriate safari hat, addresses the 10

TEAMS. Among them: Tim & Joan, Ronald & Taco Bill, Mike Pyle

& a FRIZZY-HAIRED WOMAN. Dean is absent.

As the teams take off for the pool, Dean enters. Tim pauses

long enough to say:

Just then, Dean's partner, a MAN in an electric wheelchair,

PERRY KUHN, 29, rolls in. They high five and whoo-hoo.

Dean laughs as he and Perry follow the other contestants.

INT. HOLIDOME POOL AREA - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

The pool is large and reasonably impressive, with a slide,

lawn furniture, a whirlpool and a video arcade nearby. The

contestants rush in. Tim spots something on the bottom of the

pool. A series of bricks spell out: PLANET X.

Tim unzips his hidden cummerbund/money belt. He pulls out a

small laminated packet, held together with metal rings.

Joan cracks up. They walk out casually. For good measure:

INT./EXT. TIM'S RENTAL CAR - DAY

Tim and Joan laugh as he peels out of the parking lot.

Rather than say anything, Joan just shakes her head and turns

on the radio. GROOVE IS IN THE HEART kicks in, providing a:

THE SCAVENGER HUNT MONTAGE --

INT. PLANET X FAMILY FUN CENTER - DAY

Tim, Joan and the other teams bound through a huge, Martian-

themed ball pit. They start digging through the balls. Perry

sits dejectedly off to the side in his wheelchair.

Tim and Ronald shove past Mike Pyle, knocking him down. Tim

is the first to discover a foam "moon rock" amid the balls.

The rock reads, "ASMI ROCKS!" Taped to the bottom, a message:

SERIES OF SHOTS --

- AT THE NATIONAL CZECH MUSEUM: A traditionally costumed

CZECH WOMAN, 80, shows Tim and Joan how to paint an EGG. The

egg is lovely, with intricate patterns and vibrant colors.

- IN THE CAR: Joan reads through Tim's laminated booklet as

he drives. She's really getting into it, too. Tim's phone

keeps ringing. It's Millie. He ignores it.

- IN A GYMNASIUM: Ronald awkwardly tries to make a basket,

becomes upset when he misses. Joan swishes a 3-pointer.

- AT A DAIRY FARM: The teams milk cows. Mike Pyle is

particularly proficient. Dean can't help himself.

- IN A PARKING LOT: Dean loads Perry into a handicap-

accessible van as Mike Pyle and his partner blow past them.

- AT THE IOWA PORK SHRINE: Joan gobbles down hot dogs in a

speed eating contest. Tim cheers her on.

Joan bites seductively into her hot dog. The others are close

behind. Except Ronald's partner, Taco Bill, who is vomiting.

EXT. SILO ADVENTURE PARK - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

The sun is low. Long, phallic shadows are cast by a series of

70-foot silos which are covered with thick sheets of ice.

Tim and Joan run up to Orin, who is waiting by the silos.

Some DUDES with ice climbing equipment-- ropes, picks, etc.

appear. Tim looks petrified. Joan shakes her head.

Tim's nostrils flair. Just then, Mike Pyle and his partner

arrive. Tim looks to the top of the silo. It is dizzyingly

high. He shuts his eyes for a moment, exhales.

Orin turns on a boom box, which blasts some triumphant music

(Whitesnake's HERE I GO AGAIN, perhaps).

QUICK CUTS: The Dudes get Tim and Mike Pyle into their

climbing gear-- harnesses, helmets, crampons.

And they start climbing. Sort of. Tim jams his pick into the

ice. He tries to pull himself up, but can't. Mike fares

worse. He can't even get his pick to stick in the ice.

The Dudes shout instructions. Tim and Mike try again. To no

avail. Neither could do a pull-up if his life depended on it.

A LITTLE WHILE LATER --

All the contestants have shown up. But not a damn one of them

can get more than a foot off the ground.

Joan cheers. Orin looks to the Dudes, who shrug.

A LITTLE WHILE LATER --

Orin talks on his cell phone, conferring. The contestants

wait in a field, shivering. The sun is getting lower. Orin

hangs up, sighs, shuts off the uplifting music.

Ronald mutters to himself, frustrated with his performance.

Orin hands Joan the gift card. Despite the anticlimax, Tim is

overjoyed. He picks up Joan and spins her around. Everyone

else just wanders away.

INT. TIM'S RENTAL CAR (DRIVING) - THAT EVENING

Tim is ebullient. Joan rides shotgun. The screen on Tim's

phone says that he's missed 11 calls. It rings again.

Something dawns on Tim-- who gives a shit. He glances at Joan

and her skirt and her exposed knee.

Tim pulls into a spot in the Westdale Mall parking lot. He

gestures for Joan to wait a second.

INT. MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Millie looks wounded.

EXT. WESTDALE MALL - CONTINUOUS

Tim gets out of the car.

Silence. It's as though a profound revelation has just

slipped out. As if, in an instant, everything has changed.

INT. MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Millie's heart sinks. She looks at her Beanie Babies.

Reveal: Wade is sitting in his rightful throne, watching an

aerobics show on TV. Millie snaps at him.

Millie hangs up. Wade gives her a supportive shrug.

EXT. WESTDALE MALL - CONTINUOUS

Tim snaps his phone shut. What just happened? He considers

his options for a moment.

INT. WESTDALE MALL - MOMENTS LATER

Joan window shops at a LensCrafters. Tim approaches her.

Joan smiles at him, and we:

INT. OLIVE GARDEN - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

Tim approaches the Olive Garden MAITRE D'.

Save for three tables of ELDERLY PEOPLE, the place is empty.

Tim raises his eyebrows to Joan-- not too shabby.

INT. OLIVE GARDEN, ROMANTIC BOOTH - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

Tim and Joan are seated in a candlelit booth. Opera Muzak

tinkles. If you didn't know this to be a mall-based chain,

you might think it a romantic Italian restaurant. Maybe.

An acne-scarred WAITER, 21, approaches with a tray.

The waiter exits. Tim raises his glass for a toast.

They clink glasses. Tim takes a dainty sip of his sherry.

Joan feeds Tim a bite of her lasagna. A bit sticks to his

chin. She wipes it off, semi-seductively. Tim laughs.

A beat. He takes a sip of sherry, shrugs.

Joan takes out her Blackberry. The screensaver is a family

portrait: Joan, a MAN with a goatee, and TWO CUTE KIDS. All

of them are dressed in denim.

Tim doesn't hide his shock well. Joan sees it.

Tim nods but looks more confused than ever.

INT. TIM'S RENTAL CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

Tim drives. The Olive Garden doggie bag sits in Joan's lap.

Silence, other than the radio. After a bit:

He shrugs. Joan fights her instinct to tease him.

He shrugs again, but now he's grinning from ear to ear.

INT. HOLIDOME LOBBY - LATER THAT NIGHT

Tim yawns as he and Joan enter the lobby.

Tim looks at the ground. He looks up, tries to make a joke.

She looks at him oddly as he charges ahead to the bar.

INT. HORIZONS BAR & GRILLE - NIGHT

Taco Bill sings DON'T STOP BELIEVING on the karaoke stage.

Bree, wearing a new denim skirt, grinds on the dance floor

with yet another INSURER. Dean watches the action.

He ushers them to the bar, where Ronald is seated.

Joan exits. Ronald goes to order the drinks.

Dean laughs heartily. It's a deeply uncomfortable moment. Tim

looks around. He sees Joan talking to the karaoke DJ.

Thankfully, Ronald returns with the drinks.

Dean and Tim look confused. Ronald giggles to himself.

Tim high fives Ronald. Joan returns, sits next to Tim.

They all drink to that.

A BIT LATER --

Tim has finished his sherry. The bartender pours a second

glass. Tim wears the shit-eating grin of a first-time drunk.

Tim laughs hysterically. Which makes everyone else laugh.

The bartender pours the shots. Joan whispers to Tim.

Joan passes Tim the shot. He slams it. The room applauds as

Tim nervously makes his way to the stage.

Tim confers with the DJ. The DJ nods, cues up the song. Tim

gives Joan a look of mock anger as he takes the mic.

Tim gives Ronald a thumbs-up. Ronald returns the gesture as

the opening bars of Clarence Carter's PATCHES kick in. [NOTE:

Patches is an EXTREMELY sentimental soul song about a poor

black kid named Patches.] The first verse is spoken word.

Joan and Dean whoo-hoo!

Joan and Dean rush to the dance floor. Ronald remains on his

bar stool but bops his head politely. Tim tears it up.

Patches continues, creating a:

A SERIES OF SHOTS --

- Tim drinks more sherry. The gang laughs, having a blast.

- Ronald tries to excuse himself.

Tim responds by giving Ronald a noogie. Everyone laughs.

- Joan, Dean and Ronald roam the Holidome halls. Tim jumps

out from behind a corner, whips some ice machine ice at Dean.

Dean takes off running after Tim. Joan and Ronald follow.

- The song fades out as the four of them approach the Pool

Area. The sign on the pool door says, Hours 8 AM - 11 PM.

Tim tries the door. It's open. Dean and Joan go in. Tim and

Ronald stay in the hall.

INSIDE THE POOL AREA:

Dean has placed the top of a garbage can on his head. It

looks like an old-time scuba apparatus. Tim laughs.

Dean slides down the kiddie slide into the pool, fully

clothed. Tim busts up. It looks like too much fun.

Tim goes through the door. Ronald shakes his head.

INT. HOLIDOME POOL AREA - CONTINUOUS

Tim turns back, sees Ronald walking away. Tim thinks a beat,

then keeps on. Other than Dean's splashing, it's quiet and

peaceful in the semi-darkness. Joan sits on a lawn chair.

Gulp. Now in her bra and thong, Joan jumps in. Dean bobs

around with the trash can on his head.

Tim slowly starts to undress. He carefully places his money

belt on a table. He gets down to his T-shirt and tightie-

whities. Far enough. He eases himself into the shallow end.

Joan back strokes over to Tim. He tries to look elsewhere.

Joan undoes her bra. Oh jeez.

She removes the bra, revealing her breasts-- lovely, soft,

bright white orbs surrounded by very tan skin. Tim shudders.

Joan gets close to Tim. His arms remain at his side.

Closer.

She kisses him on the mouth, moves his hands to her breasts.

Tim gives in. They make out. In the deep end, Dean takes the

garbage can off his head and watches.

Joan pulls off Tim's T-shirt, flings it aside. They're really

going to town. OFF-SCREEN, we hear a sliding door open.

HIGH ANGLE (Specifically, four floors up): From this POV, it

looks like Tim and Joan are having sex. Dean, meanwhile, has

moved closer and may or may not be masturbating as he watches

them. Reveal whose POV this is:

Orin has come out onto his balcony. He looks aghast.

Tim looks up, makes fleeting eye contact with Orin. Shit! Tim

scrambles to get out of the pool. Joan is a half-step behind

him. Dean decides that now would be a good time to moon Orin.

Tim grabs his money belt as he and Joan run out of the pool

area. [Note: Tim has a conspicuous erection.]

INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Joan, still topless, leads Tim by the hand as they sprint

toward her room. They run past a SECURITY GUARD along the

way. [Note: Tim still has a conspicuous erection.]

INT. JOAN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

They burst into Joan's room, laughing to the point of tears.

Then Joan mauls Tim. She tackles him to her bed. He rolls on

top of her. A primal, guttural howl erupts from Tim. Then:

It's on.

INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - NIGHT (A LITTLE WHILE LATER)

Dean pounds on the door to the Junior Suite.

Dean lumbers away, leaving puddles of water in his wake.

INT. JOAN'S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Post-sex. Tim lies in bed, beatific. Joan, now wearing

glasses and conservative PJ's, comes out of the bathroom.

Joan just smiles as she gets into bed.

Joan awkwardly pats Tim on the head as he drifts to sleep.

INT. JOAN'S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

Joan is talking on the phone with her son. Her demeanor is

entirely different-- a tone and physicality we've not seen.

Tim wakes up. The morning light hurts his hung over eyes.

Tim staggers out of bed, smiles. Joan holds up a finger.

She hangs up. Tim does a theatrical stretch and yawn.

Tim sees that Joan's computer is open-- and his Two Diamond

presentation is up on the screen.

Tim is livid. He ejects his disc from Joan's computer.

This stops Tim in his tracks. Better than Roger Lemke. Wow.

This stops Joan in her tracks. Her inner pain percolates.

She allows a chuckle. Tim rubs her shoulders, supportive.

Joan shakes him off.

Tim gets up, even more pissed off than he was before.

He wraps up in a towel, grabs his money cummerbund and goes.

A moment. Joan looks at the rumpled bed sheets, starts making

the bed. As she does, she sees the Clairol Nice `N' Easy hair

dye box in the garbage. Joan smiles a what has become of my

life smile. She sits on the bed and stares out the window.

INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

A MAID looks up from her cart, smiles. Tim, wearing only the

towel, mumbles as he walks by.

INT. HOLIDOME POOL AREA - THAT MOMENT

Tim's clothes remain where he left them the night before. We

drift off his clothes to a CHUBBY KID with floaties bobbing

in the pool. The kid is staring at something:

Dean is asleep in a chaise lounge chair in his underpants.

INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Tim approaches the Junior Suite just as Ronald exits. Tim

self-consciously tightens the towel.

Dean, still in his underpants, approaches.

Ronald walks off. Tim deflates.

INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

Bill Krogstad paces in a church, talking on his phone.

Reveal: An OBESE BRIDE, 25, and her greasy, mustached GROOM,

40, pose for a PHOTOGRAPHER.

Krogstad hangs up. He walks over to his large, beaming

daughter. He puts on a fake smile as she gives him a hug.

The photographer snaps a photo. Krogstad chokes back tears.

INT. JUNIOR SUITE BATHROOM - DAY

Tim stares at his cell phone. He looks in the mirror.

He picks up a hairbrush and tries to break it. But it won't

break. Dean enters.

Dean leads Tim out of the bathroom. Tim sits on a desk chair.

Dean sits on the edge of the desk. He looks fatherly.

Tim stares at Dean for an incredulous moment.

Tim slowly nods, surprised to find himself moved.

INT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Orin enthusiastically introduces a WOMAN in a smart pantsuit.

The room goes nuts. As Orin leaves the stage he spots Tim

waiting in the wings. Tim gestures for Orin to come outside.

INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Orin, stone-faced, approaches Tim.

A moment. Orin nods, almost imperceptibly.

INT. HOLIDOME ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

Tim and Orin silently ride the elevator to the fourth floor.

INT. THE TIFFANY SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

Orin opens the door to the Tiffany Suite, a slightly larger

version of the Junior Suite. He ushers Tim inside.

Tim sits. Orin goes to the mini-fridge, takes out a Sprite.

Orin opens the Sprite, drinks. He reaches into a briefcase.

He hands Tim a document with dozens of signatures on it.

Tim shakes his head as he reads the names.

Just as Deanzie predicted. Orin snatches back the petition.

He rips it in two.

Orin sits next to Tim on the couch, closer than he needs to.

Tim hesitantly follows Orin to the desk. A laptop sits open.

Orin pounds his fist on the desk. Tim swallows hard.

We push in on Tim-- at the crossroads of all crossroads.

Outside, a clap of thunder booms ominously.

Tim looks away, avoiding eye contact. Then:

Orin claps once, smiles like a proud grandparent.

INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY (OUTSIDE HORIZONS) - LATER

Dean has dozens of Hello My Name Is stickers with "Deanzie

For President!" written on them. He forces one on a WOMAN.

The woman shakes her head and walks away. Ronald approaches.

Tim's guilt is apparent in his awkward demeanor.

Tim abruptly walks away. Dean and Ronald look at each other,

perplexed, as Tim exits the hotel into the pouring rain.

EXT. CEDAR RAPIDS STREET - EVENING (MOMENTS LATER)

A cold, hard rain falls as Tim walks from the Holidome toward

an Applebee's across the busy street.

INT. APPLEBEE'S - CONTINUOUS

Tim enters and walks to the bar. He's soaking wet and looks

despondent. A cheery female bartender, KAY, 40, greets him.

As she pours a healthy glass of sherry:

Tim slams the sherry in one gulp-- to Kay's dismay.

Kay watches as Tim heads for the bathroom. He leaves his cell

phone on the bar.

INT. APPLEBEE'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Tim pees at the urinal. He zips up, goes to wash his hands.

In the mirror, he's shocked to see: A squinty, drugged out

MAN, 25, exit the stall, followed by... Bree.

A moment of recognition.

Bree coughs a hacking, phlegmy cough. She's very out of it.

He removes a few hard candies from his pocket. She takes one.

The squinty-eyed man, GARY, who has been drinking out of the

sink, looks up at Tim.

Bree examines Tim, standing stiffly, hands in his pockets.

Bree nonchalantly pinches his nose. Tim looks oddly touched.

INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - NIGHT

Mike Pyle, in a bold chartreuse sweater vest, quietly confers

with Orin outside a conference room.

INT. HOLIDOME CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Orin enters the conference room alone. He un-mutes a

speakerphone. The Chicken Dance Polka blares from the other

end.

INT. VFW RECEPTION HALL - CONTINUOUS

WEDDING GUESTS do the chicken dance. Krogstad strains to be

heard over the music.

Krogstad clicks off his phone, pumps his fist, overjoyed. He

approaches his wife.

Krogstad hustles out of the reception hall. The fleshy bride

and her oily groom watch him go.

INT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - NIGHT

On stage, a JACK NICHOLSON IMPERSONATOR does a lame routine.

Laughter. Joan and Ronald are in the back of the room.

Dean urgently approaches Joan and Ronald.

The crowd guffaws as faux Jack does his thing.

A pall overtakes the room-- this used to be fun. Now it's

just kind of sad.

INT. UNCLE KEN'S PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT

Boston's MORE THAN A FEELING blares on the radio of a pick-up

truck. Tim politely rocks out, sandwiched between Bree and

Gary in the front seat. A violent-looking, wire-thin man in

an Applebee's uniform, UNCLE KEN, 40, drives. After a bit:

Gary opens the glove box, passes Ken a glass pipe. Ken lights

up, takes a hit, passes it to Bree. Bree follows suit, then

passes the pipe to Tim. Tim looks at it, pauses.

A beat. Then they all laugh like crazy. So Tim laughs, too.

Bree puts the pipe in Tim's mouth. He looks frightened.

They laugh. Bree lights the pipe. Tim inhales and instantly:

oh fuck, Oh Fuck, OH FUCK! Tim's eyes bulge, his teeth grind.

Then he shakes his head like a wet dog and violently COUGHS.

INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY (OUTSIDE THE BALLROOM) - NIGHT

Dean has his phone to his ear. Ronald and Joan watch.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

A series of shots as Tim-- sweaty, high and extremely hyper--

dances with Bree to the deafening death metal. The party is a

volatile mix of BIKER TYPES and SPEED FREAKS. Even though his

salmon-colored oxford shirt has come untucked from his casual

slacks, Tim still looks a tad out of place.

The following conversation is shouted because of the music.

Tim pauses. Then-- what the heck. He unzips his money belt...

INT. APPLEBEE'S - NIGHT

Dean, Ronald and Joan look worried as they listen to Kay, the

friendly Applebee's bartender.

INT. FARMHOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT

Bree snorts a line in a disgusting, fetid bathroom. Tim sits

on the counter. He's jacked up, sweaty and very chatty.

She offers Tim a line. He declines.

She gives him a couple pills. He pops them without thinking.

Something struck a nerve with Tim. He chokes up.

That did it. Now Tim is weeping. Bree notices.

Before Tim can respond to that, the door bursts open. It's

Uncle Ken, and he is NOT happy. Uh-oh.

INT. BILL KROGSTAD'S LESABRE - NIGHT

Krogstad chugs coffee as he drives through the night.

INT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - NIGHT

Orin and Mike Pyle laugh as they raise a glass for a toast.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Dean's minivan pulls into the gravel driveway of the

dilapidated, isolated farmhouse. We can tell it's the party

house by the music blasting and the DEGENERATES on the porch.

Dean and Joan climb out of the minivan. The rain is falling

harder. Ronald slides open the back door and climbs out. He

has on a long black rain coat. He nearly slips on some ice.

INT. FARMHOUSE BATHROOM/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Uncle Ken grabs Tim and shoves him out into the hall. Tim

trips over a WASTED TEEN GIRL and stumbles against the wall.

Bree looks legitimately worried for Tim.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Dean, Joan and Ronald formulate a plan.

INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Uncle Ken drags Tim into a kitchen full of PARTYGOERS gathered

around a keg of Natural Ice. He shoves Tim face first against

the wall. Tim takes this opportunity to notice the peeling

wallpaper, which surprisingly has the same floral pattern as

his own kitchen wallpaper.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ronald and Joan approach the front door. Judging from the

looks on the faces of the DUDES on the porch, black folks are

not a common sight at this residence. Gary, the squinty-eyed

guy Tim met in the bathroom with Bree, ogles Joan.

The dudes let Joan and Ronald pass into the house.

INT./EXT. DEAN'S MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS

Dean sits silently in the driver's seat. The quiet gets to

him. He starts humming, then mumble-sings to himself and

drums the steering wheel.

INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Joan and Ronald make their way through the house, clocking

the aggressively angry looks as they go. Joan sees something:

IN THE KITCHEN: Uncle Ken is choking Tim. The PARTYGOERS

cheer. Uncle Ken punches Tim in the stomach. Tim falls to the

filthy linoleum. Bree protests.

He kicks Tim hard. It's looking bad, when all of a sudden:

They all turn to see Ronald. In the black trench coat, he

actually looks BAD ASS. He has one hand in the coat pocket.

Uncle Ken blinks a few times. Then he lets Tim get up.

Ronald takes Tim's arm. Joan joins them. The three of them

walk backwards toward the door.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Dean is outside the minivan, taking a leak on a tree. He

looks toward the house.

Ronald, Tim and Joan exit the house.

They run for Dean's minivan. Tim slips, sliding across the

snow and mud. Ronald drags him halfway across the lawn before

Tim finally gets to his feet.

Dean, meanwhile, tries to finish peeing as he makes his way

back to the van-- doing a sort of crab walk to avoid pissing

on himself. Tim, Ronald and Joan dive into the minivan. Dean

climbs back into the driver's seat.

Bree and gang exit the house and watch as Dean peels out,

tossing up bits of gravel as he speeds away.

INT. DEAN'S MINIVAN - MOMENTS LATER

Dean looks nervously in the rearview mirror-- all clear.

Ronald tries to calm Tim down in the backseat.

Dean looks at Joan and Ronald-- What?

The minivan speeds through the dark, rainy night.

INT. JUNIOR SUITE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Tim sits on the couch bouncing his legs, still messed up.

Joan sits with him. Dean and Ronald watch, worried.

Joan shoots Dean a look-- shut the fuck up.

For some reason, Tim finds this funny. He laughs hysterically.

Ronald sighs, nods. Dean kisses Tim's sweaty forehead.

Dean and Ronald head for the bedroom. Tim looks at Joan.

Tim rests his head on Joan's lap. His eyes are still on fire.

Tim shuts his eyes. Joan must be a good mom.

A KNOCKING sound fades in, providing a:

INT. THE TIFFANY SUITE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Orin stirs in his king-size bed. The knocking is at his door.

He gets out of bed, puts on a robe and goes to the door. He

peeks through the eyehole.

Orin glances in the mirror, smooths his hair. He undoes the

chain and opens the door...

Tim bursts in and attacks! Orin, being relatively frail,

immediately tumbles to the carpet. This can't be good.

INT./EXT. BILL KROGSTAD'S LESABRE (DRIVING) - NIGHT

Krogstad yawns but drives with determination as his car

passes a sign that reads CEDAR RAPIDS - 100 MILES.

INT. JUNIOR SUITE - EARLY MORNING

Dean and Ronald sleep soundly in their beds. We drift off of

them to the couch, where Joan has fallen asleep. She wakes,

realizes that Tim is no longer there.

INT./EXT. TIM'S RENTAL CAR (DRIVING) - EARLY MORNING

The first hints of daylight illuminate the eastern sky. Kenny

Loggins' WHENEVER I CALL YOU FRIEND plays on the radio. Tim,

still hopped up, drives. He enthusiastically sings along.

Tim drives past a farm and sees dozens of hogs foraging

around in a sloppy pen. He stomps the brakes, sliding

dangerously onto the muddy shoulder.

EXT. RURAL ROADSIDE/HOG FARM - CONTINUOUS

Tim gets out of the car. The peppy song is still playing. Tim

sings along as he dances to the back of the car.

Tim opens up the trunk. That's when we see:

INSIDE THE TRUNK: Orin, in his pajamas, bound and gagged by

Holiday Inn bedsheets. His shouts are muffled by the gag.

Tim pulls Orin from the trunk. Orin's feet are tied together,

so he has to hop as Tim leads him toward the hog farm.

Orin falls face first into the muddy ditch.

Tim helps Orin to his feet. Several enormous HOGS rush toward

them on the other side of a barbed wire fence.

With great difficulty, Tim picks up Orin. Then, he awkwardly

hurls him over the barbed wire fence. Orin lands on his back

in a deep pile of mud and hog shit. The hogs descend.

Tim goes to his car, leaving Orin wriggling with the hogs.

INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

A HUSBAND and WIFE sleep. Their phone rings. They stir. The

clock says 6:45 AM. The woman rolls over.

The man answers the phone. (NOTE: We should now recognize the

couple as the clients Tim dealt with in the Northlands

conference room.)

INT. TIM'S RENTAL CAR - CONTINUOUS

Tim talks on his cell as he drives.

INT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - LATER THAT MORNING

An eagle soars on a large video screen. A patriotic anthem

plays. We boom down from the screen to find Ronald. He's on

stage finishing up his Two Diamond presentation.

The words, "Ronald Wilkes Insurance: Working For You" appear

on screen. Ronald's face dissolves over the eagle.

The CROWD goes nuts, applauding wildly. Dean and Joan start a

standing ovation. Ronald, though exhausted, beams on stage.

Tim is nowhere to be found. An EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER

addresses the crowd.

Joan, Dean and Ronald exchange worried looks. Dean stands.

Just then, Tim appears. He is filthy-- covered in mud, sweat,

hog shit and tears. He futilely smooths his hair and tries to

tuck in his shirt as he takes the stage to sparse applause.

Tim goes to the computer set up on stage for Power Point. He

puts in his disc. His presentation appears on the screen.

Tim knocks a folder off the podium. Papers fly everywhere.

Awkward murmurs. At this moment, a very pleased Bill Krogstad

walks in with Mike Pyle. Krogstad tenses, however, when he

sees Tim's state.

Tim laughs. He looks up and sees Bill.

Krogstad chuckles, preferring to avoid any public drama.

This draws chuckles from the crowd.

Tim's lip starts to quiver, and with great effort:

Mike Pyle blinks several times. Krogstad seethes. Before Tim

can fully bask in the glow of his triumph:

Orin, still in his pajamas and caked in hog shit, points TWO

CEDAR RAPIDS COPS in Tim's direction. Tactful pandemonium

ensues. Dean, Ronald and Joan rush to Tim's side.

Jesus Lippe, what did you do? Aw jeez. This is no good.

Before the cops get to him, Tim hands Dean a crumpled piece

of paper.

A cop cuffs Tim and leads him out of the ballroom.

INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

Tim sits on a metal bench in a dank holding cell.

Reveal: He's chatting with a massive black man, REGINALD, 30.

A GUARD opens the cell door.

Tim hands Reginald a business card.

Reginald gives Tim a warm hug.

EXT. CITY LOCK-UP - DAY

Tim walks out of the jail into the bright sunlight. Dean is

there waiting for him. They walk toward Dean's minivan.

Dean gives Tim a hug. He then pulls a crumpled piece of paper

from his pocket-- it's the sheet Tim gave him earlier.

Dean tosses the paper into the trash. We now see what it says.

On Holiday Inn stationary, in Tim's scrawl: www.paypal.com.

Username: OrinHelgesson. Password: PontoonMan123.

INT. DEAN'S MINIVAN - DAY

Dean drives. Ronald rides shotgun. Tim and Joan are in back.

The minivan cruises past downtown Cedar Rapids. Tim looks up

at the buildings. So tall.

Ronald considers his Two Diamond plaque.

Ronald starts giggling. It turns into a laugh. The laugh

becomes infectious. Before long, Tim, Joan, Ronald and Dean

are all laughing their asses off.

EXT. CEDAR RAPIDS AIRPORT - EVENING

Dean, Ronald and Joan accompany Tim, now cleaned up, to the

airport. Tim sets down his old American Tourister.

Dean picks Tim up in a bear hug, spins him around. Ronald

gives Tim a more subdued hug. Then there's Joan.

He puts out his hand. She laughs and hugs him instead. Tim

closes his eyes. She feels so good. Smells so good.

Joan's eyes are wide open. She swallows hard. She will not

cry. It's OK. Keep telling yourself everything will be OK...

INT. PLANE - NIGHT

Tim looks out the window, watching the city lights of Cedar

Rapids fade away. He catches his reflection in the window. He

exhales. He smiles a little.

Tim relaxes in his seat. He looks at his seat mate, a

pleasant-looking WOMAN in her mid-30s.

SUPERSCRIPT: One Day Later

INT. OLD COUNTRY BUFFET - NIGHT

Tim loads a plate with macaroni, meatloaf, peas and mashed

potatoes. Millie selects fish, potatoes, rice and corn.

They wordlessly walk from the buffet to a booth. They sit and

start eating in silence. After a bit:

Tim tries to smile at Millie. He is surprised to see that her

eyes are filling with tears.

Without saying a word, Millie struggles to pry the small

diamond engagement ring from her sausage-like finger.

Finally, she gets it off and hands it to Tim.

He thinks of protesting. Instead, he takes the ring and puts

it in his pocket. Millie sniffles a bit, composes herself.

Tim opens his mouth to say something. Before he can think of

anything to say:

Wade sits down with a ridiculously full plate of food.

EXT. TIM'S BACKYARD - DAY

Tim dumps birdseed in the feeder. Sunlight filters through

the tree branches. The snow is starting to melt.

Tim smiles at his old, gnarled neighbor, LESLIE, 80.

They take off their gloves to shake hands. Leslie won't let

go of Tim's hand-- the way old men sometimes do.

Leslie pats Tim on the shoulder. As he heads back inside:

Tim chuckles. He goes back to his yard. He pauses. At his

feeder: A robin. A sure sign of spring.

An uplifting song fades in, along with:

A SERIES OF SHOTS --

- ON A LAKE: Tim is pulled behind a boat on waterskis. He

falls face first, skipping across the lake.

- AT A BALL DIAMOND: Tim, playing in a summer softball

league, slides headfirst into third base.

- AT A STRIP MALL: A COUPLE walks past a discount shoe store

and into TIM LIPPE INSURANCE. The camera follows them into

the cramped, decidedly unimpressive office. Tim, seated at a

desk, looks directly at the camera and stiffly addresses it.

A fanciful unicorn prances across the screen, and we:

INT. CANADIAN CABIN - DAY

REVEAL: Tim, Dean and Ronald have been watching Tim's ad on a

TV at a lakeside cabin. Tim looks proudly at his friends.

Tim whips an empty beer can at Dean. The three friends laugh--

living life in the moment. As it should be.
