The wrestlers slap hands and THE REF blows the whistle. Kyle

immediately shoots in for a double leg. The Other Wrestler

tries to sprawl but Kyle is in too deep. Kyle lifts him high

and dumps him hard to the mat. The audience reacts and the

Ref stops the action. The other wrestler bravely pops up but

he is obviously stung.

Kyle looks at Mike and nods but his eyes are wild. The Ref

blows the whistle and Kyle and the Other Wrestler lock up.

They dance a bit and finally the Other Wrestler tries to wrap

Kyle up. Kyle back pedals and then literally throws the Other

Wrestler off the mat. The Ref has seen enough. He quickly

He sits on one bed.

She sits on the other facing him.

She hands him a piece of paper.

Kyle reluctantly reads it.

Kyle reads it again.

Kyle stares at the page.

Cindy is caught of guard by the question.

Cindy judges her son's look and speaks from the heart.

Kyle looks at the page on more time and then suddenly,

without warning, pounces on his mother pinning her to the

behind.

tries to push Mike back.

Mike deflects Kyle and Kyle spills to the ground.

Kyle gets up and starts to circle Mike. Mike has no choice

but reciprocate.

Kyle head pumps. Mike takes the bait and jumps back.

Kyle wait... Watch the head fake!

Kyle, stop for a minute. Keep your hands out, Mike.

Kyle head fakes again but this time he's in. Before Mike

knows what hits him, he's on his back.

Ow! Oh shit.

Kyle is all over Mike. Mike's trying to fight back but it's

useless and even kind of pathetic.

Shut up, Terry! Kyle, stop it!

Mike gets up to hands and knees but Kyle drives him hard to

the ground.

Ow! Shit! Ouch! He's getting killed.

Terry rushes in and tries to pull Kyle off but he's lost it.

Finally, he wraps his arms around Kyle and pulls him off.

Kyle spins free and fronts Terry. Terry immediately puts up

his hands.

Kyle turns and runs off.

He doesn't stop. Jackie turns to Mike.

coffee. The remnants of a pancake breakfast are on the table.

There is one clean plate where Kyle usually sits.

After a moment, Kyle comes up from the basement and sits down

at the table without saying anything.
