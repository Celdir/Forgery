FADE IN:

EXT.   SUBURBAN STREET--DAY

VERONICA SAWYER, a sullen seventeen year old beauty is

jogging down a suburban street in a stylish running outfit.

Evocative female voices can be heard, softly wailing.

EXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--DAY

VERONICA lurches into a neighborhood park, running with an

increasing sense of desperation. The female voices wail louder.

EXT.   PROMENADE--DAY

VERONICA whooshes past a series of shops and a movie theatre.

EXT.   THE SAWYER HOME--DAY

Reveling in her own sweat and agony, VERONICA bounds onto

the lawn of her impressive upper middle class home.

She painfully rushes closer and closer to the front door as

the female moans swell to a deafening summit. The evocative

wailing cuts off as she grabs the doorknob.

INY.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAY

VERONICA zips into a chic, but understated ensemble as she

launches into voice-over narration.

Composed and unsweaty, VERONICA fingers her bangs in the

mirror then rambles off.

INT.   HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY--DAY

Continuing her narration, VERONICA glides through a bustling

high school hallway with a frozen smile.

OUTSIDE THE CAFETERIA

With her back turned to the viewer, VERONICA stands at the

outskirts of the cafeteria entrance. The viewer's viewpoint

approaches and finally curls around VERONICA to reveal that

she is writing in a diary, wearing a monocle.

THE DIARY PAGE

VERONICA'S pen sways across the diary page forming the words

echoed by her voice-over.

A sudden off-screen bark from HEATHER MCNAMARA causes the pen

to recklessly rocket across the written words.

VERONICA coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily

addressing the amusingly robust, conventionally beautiful,

trendily coiffed HEATHER MCNAMARA.

From behind HEATHER MCNAMARA emerges a similarly trendily

accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif, HEATHER DUKE.

She is clutching a tattered copy of "The Catcher in the Rye."

INSIDE THE CAFETERIA

VERONICA, flanked by HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE,

strides into the lunchroom pandemonium.

The stunning HEATHER CHANDLER turns from the tray before her

toward her incoming comrades. She is dressed stylishly and

expensively but not trendily; her hair, dramatically tied back.

Pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper, HEATHER

CHANDLER smiles. The content of what Heather says is

consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks

is sexy, dangerous, and mysterious. She is a mythic bitch.

POV ON CAFETERIA LINE

Unattractive and quite overweight, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK

guiltily plops two jellos on her tray and clunks forward in line.

CAFETERIA ENTRANCE

VERONICA's arm, seemingly involuntary, latches onto the

outstretched pen.

Both HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE bend over. HEATHER

CHANDLER violently laughs.

HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE stand erect, embarrassed.

VERONICA scurries to the contorting HEATHER DUKE.

THE JOCKS' TABLE

The traditionally handsome KURT KELLY, the serene black EARL

FRAZIER and the massive RAM sit with other stereotypical

Jocks taking in VERONICA and the HEATHERS.

KURT and RAM raise their right arms and slam their fists

together.

RAM makes a frantic spinning motion. EARL is bored.

CAFETERIA ENTRANCE

In slow motion, VERONICA finishes the note and rises up

along with her makeshift desk, HEATHER DUKE.

HEATHER MCNAMARA hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line.

VERONICA hands the note to an impressed HEATHER CHANDLER.

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK pays the CASHIER and then,

grasping her lunch tray with both paws, moves toward

VERONICA and the HEATHERS.

HEATHER MCNAMARA excitedly tugs on HEATHER CHANDLER'S arm as

MARTHA approaches. With a tranquil smile, HEATHER CHANDLER

passes the note to her frantic disciple.

In a self-consciously clandestine manner, HEATHER MCNAMARA

saunters past MARTHA then wields around to sneakily tuck the

note onto MARTHA's tray.

The slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles

past a magnetic preppie PETER DAWSON and a thin, black,

bespectacled DENNIS. The guys are working a large stand

which has a cashbox reading THE FAMINE FUND and a banner

reading WESTERBURG FEEDS THE WORLD.

HEATHERS' TABLE

The Girls reach their table with HEATHER MCNAMARA and

HEATHER DUKE sitting themselves down first.

HEATHER CHANDLER draws up a clipboard.

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER briskly bop away from the table

as a wounded HEATHER DUKE retreats to The Catcher in the Rye.

VERONICA shakes her head and looks off. She's suddenly

captured by the sight of a JAMES DEANESQUE GUY sitting stark

in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind a

Transfixed, VERONICA crashes into seated BETTY FINN, a slightly

overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones.

VERONICA crouches down, embarrassed and rueful.

VERONICA gently laughs at BETTY's innocent awe.

BETTY pulls from her purse a picture showing a YOUNG BETTY

FINN AND VERONICA SAWYER, arm-in-arm, dressed in Halloween

costumes: BETTY is an angel, VERONICA is a witch.

VERONICA glows at the photo until HEATHER CHANDLER tows

VERONICA away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor.

THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE

A coolly coed cabal of Country Club Kids icily eye the

approaching VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER. Country Club

kid COUTRNEY sourly speaks out.

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE

Alone at a table in the Siberia of the cafeteria, MARTHA

finishes a forkful of chicken. She spears her plate again

and brings the fork up.

THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE

HEATHER CHANDLER, Veronica in tow, hits the Country Club Kids

with a salvo of false pleasantness, capped by a scowling smile.

COURTNEY express elation in spite of yourself as HEATHER

CHANDLER delicately takes a tot and turns around to face

VERONICA. HEATHER CHANDLER inserts her finger in her mouth

doing the "induce-vomiting" signal before devouring the tot

and turning back around.

HEATHER CHANDLER raises her clipboard. VERONICA closes her

eyes and shakes her head with a half-smile.

A stunned tableau; until Country Club Kid KEITH speaks.

THE FAMINE FUND STAND

PETER reaches into the Famine Fund Box and takes some bills.

CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE

HEATHER CHANDLER drags VERONICA down a cafeteria lane.

She points to a table of unfashionably dressed and coiffed

students. Some wear glasses, some wear braces, some wear both.

THE GEEKS' TABLE

The GEEKS react to being pointed at. Their boney leader RODNEY

splatters milk over himself.

CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE

VERONICA confronts HEATHER CHANDLER.

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE

Her sweaty lips moving rapidly, MARTHA anxiously reads the note.

THE GEEKS' TABLE

The nervous GEEKS fidget and roughhouse each other in an

involuntarily immature reaction to their beautiful interviewers.

VERONICA tugs HEATHER CHANDLER away from the table.

VERONICA again catches sight of the JAMES DEANESQUE GUY.

He wraps his fingers around an egg and unfolds them back.

The egg is gone. He smiles. VERONICA smiles back.

Her trance is broken by a boisterous HEATHER MCNAMARA and

HEATHER DUKE who careen into the two pollsters.

POV ON MARTHA

MARTHA looks up from the note to the JOCKS' table and KURT

KELLY, then flustered, back down at the note.

HEATHER CHANDLER floats off. A disturbed VERONICA takes a

moment to react.

VERONICA follows the leader. She calls out.

EXT.   SCHOOL PARKING LOT

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER march into the school parking

lot toward four HEAVY METALERS (one female) hanging out on a

car hood. The girls' conversation is heard in voice-over.

BETTY FINN'S TABLE

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER set themselves down with BETTY

FINN and her LOOK-ALIKE FRIENDS.

JOCKS' TABLE

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER warily stand at the outskirts

of the JOCKS' bastion of vulgarity.

INT.   SMOKE-FILLED HALLWAY

In a dark, smoky hallway, VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER

cough toward a batch of STONERS in tattered forms of dress.

INT.   THE SCHOOL LIBRARY

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER click-click across the school

library floor to where an ALL-OUT NERD studies in solitude.

PARKING LOT

Heavy Metaler MATT grins.

BETTY FINN'S TABLE

BETTY FINN daintily peeps up.

JOCKS' TABLE

RAM sputters out some chicken to bellow.

STONERS' HALLWAY

A FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET starts to speak, then stops...

LIBRARY

The ALL-OUT NERD lashes out.

PARKING LOT

Heavy Metaler CLYDE turns from his friend MATT.

Two Heavy Metal lovers, JACKIE and STEVE, intertwined against

the windshield blankly respond.

CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER continue their conversation

chugging through another busy cafeteria lane.

HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE burst back between them.

POV ON MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK

MARTHA, with awkward apprehension, stumbles toward KURT and

the JOCKS. VERONICA and the HEATHERS stop breathing.

MARTHA mumbles something unintelligible from where the girls

stand. KURT'S head detonates with a terrifying cackle. MARTHA

flees the cafeteria in horror. VERONICA spins away from her

mirthful friends in disgust and makes eye contact with the

similarly disturbed JAMES DEANESQUE GUY.

VERONICA lurches away. She brakes against the Foodless Fund

stand where PETER DAWSON is hollering away.

HEATHER CHANDLER wings a twenty dollar bill into the cashbox.

INT.   GIRLS BATHROOM

Combing their hair in the bathroom mirror, the HEATHERS

speak in comically whining-and-pathetic imitations of Martha

Dumptruck as VERONICA shakes her head with a half-smile.

HEATHER DUKE's gentle off-screen voice slices in.

VERONICA reveals her right index finger is cut noticeably

short, then walks over to the stalls.

THE STALL

VERONICA stands in a tight stall with an ashamed HEATHER DUKE.

HEATHER DUKE holds up her copy of The Catcher in the Rye and

makes a bizarrely defiant smile.

HEATHER DUKE puts down her book and opens her mouth.

VERONICA sticks her finger in.

CAFETERIA ENTRANCE

A gnarly melange of chicken and potatoes is scraped off a plate

into a cafeteria trashcan as VERONICA and the HEATHERS stroll

by outside. VERONICA pauses to peer in at the JAMES DEANESQUE GUY.

As VERONICA walks off, HEATHER MCNAMARA oinks out some amusing

sexual noises.

CAFETERIA/JASON DEAN'S TABLE

VERONICA saunters to JASON DEAN.

JOCKS' TABLE

The JOCKS witness VERONICA and J.D.

J.D.'S TABLE

An intrigued J.D. laconically answers

HEATHER CHANDLER breaks VERONICA's daze of admiration.

KURT and RAM move into the exiting VERONICA's place.

RAM sticks his finger through a piece of pie on J.D.'s plate.

J.D. gracefully stands, reaches into his coat, and pulls out a

a .357 Magnum. He fires twice at the viewer.

EXT.   THE SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY

Croquet wickets have been set up in standard form. VERONICA and

the HEATHERS stand at various positions in the yard holding

different colored mallets next to matching balls. HEATHER

CHANDLER knocks her ball through the middle wicket.

HEATHER CHANDLER knocks her red ball into HEATHER DUKE'S

green one.

The Girls look to the doelike HEATHER DUKE with incredulous faces.

HEATHER CHANDLER places her foot on her red ball. She swings

her mallet down hard on the red ball sending the adjacent

green one rocketing into a flower bed.

HEATHER CHANDLER's next shot falls short of the next wicket.

HEATHER MCNAMARA hits her ball through a wicket and squeals.

HEATHER MCNAMARA misses her next shot.

HEATHER DUKE tries to navigate a shot from the flower bed.

As her friends howl, HEATHER DUKE slams her ball out of the

flower bed. The ball bounces off a tree and amazingly goes

through a wicket. HEATHER DUKE squeals in delight.

HEATHER DUKE's next shot falls short of the next wicket.

VERONICA begins setting up her shot.

HEATHER CHANDLER again hits her ball into HEATHER DUKE'S.

HEATHER CHANDLER slams HEATHER DUKE's ball back into the

flower bed. VERONICA'S MOM calls out the back screen door.

As the HEATHERS head into the house, VERONICA picks up HEATHER

DUKE'S ball and exuberantly throws it back toward the wickets.

Veronica's MOM, carrying a tray of pate, and DAD, carrying a

Robert Ludlum book, place themselves around a patio table.

VERONICA sinks into the empty middle deck chair.

DAD immediately returns to reading with a wide grin.

EXT.   OUTSIDE 7-11--NIGHT

A Volkswagen Cabriolet pulls up in front of a 7-11 with

HEATHER CHANDLER at the wheel. VERONICA pops out of the

car, into the store. HEATHER CHANDLER clamors to her.

INT.   7-11

Stylishly dressed-to-massacre, VERONICA reaches out to a bag

of Corn Nuts as J.D.'s off-screen voice disarms her.

VERONICA smiles at her Coolness. J.D. returns the smile.

7-11 PARKING LOT

VERONICA and J.D. slurp by J.D.'s ferocious motorcycle.

HEATHER CHANDLER sounds her car horn with a grimace.

VERONICA glares at her then turns back to J.D.

VERONICA grows serious as the car horn sounds again.

The car horn blares again.

INT. DORMITORY ROOM--NIGHT

DAVID, Heather Chandler's fine looking college beau, leads

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER into a cramped, eclectically

tacky dorm room. Music pounds the door.

The semi-handsome BRAD leans aainst a desk while a WHINING

STUDENT talks with COED ONE who sits on the floor.

As they head out the door, BRAD whispers something in

BRAD'S FRIEND's ear causing the pair to snarl off a laugh.

INT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

The viewer is taken back and forth from a shattered post-party

VERONICA to the traumatic dormitory party itself. The sobbing

monocled VERONICA writes at her desk.

VERONICA frenziedly scribbles, trying to get her pen to write.

She throws the pen across the room and pulls out another.

DORMITORY HALLWAY

The chaotic hallway rumbles with beer cups and loud music.

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER's stylish garb clashes with the

laid-back dress of the COLLEGE STUDENTS.

BRAD anxiously hands VERONICA a cup of beer as he watches

DAVID and HEATHER CHANDLER move through a staircase door.

They uncomfortably sip their beers. A deadly pause ensues.

INT.   DAVID'S DORM ROOM

HEATHER CHANDLER and DAVID sit on the latter's bed, surrounded

by a Macintosh and a series of obnoxious Ferrari posters.

They kiss. DAVID doing most of the work.

DAVID pushes HEATHER CHANDLER's head down.

DORM HALLWAY

BRAD has given up on conversation.

A BIG AMIABLE STUDENT approaches before VERONICA can show disgust.

With a wink, BRAD squirms off. VERONICA dashes into the room

with the coats.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

VERONICA rampages through her diary.

J.F.K. the cat jumps onto the Diary.

VERONICA flings the screeching cat off and continues.

DORM "COAT" ROOM

Panting, VERONICA collapses at a desk in the "coat" room.

She draws a Vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours

some in her beer cup, slouching down in her chair.

VERONICA lights a match from a 7-11 matchbook. She eerily

brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it touches.

With an eek of pain, she tosses the match away into the Vodka

cup, setting it afire. VERONICA laughs to herself before

tossing the flaming cup out the window.

EXT.   ALLEY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY  NIGHT

The flaming cup lands in a large rusted garbage can filled

with other cups and various refuse. The flames spread...

INT.   DORMITORY BATHROOM  NIGHT

A dejected HEATHER CHANDLER walks into a multi-mirror-and-sink

bathroom. Using a glass off one of the sinks, she gargles some

water and then spits it at her own reflection.

THE DORM "COAT" ROOM

VERONICA closes the window as BRAD opens the door.

BRAD plops down onto the bed of coats and begins bouncing.

VERONICA yanks up her coat from beneath BRAD on the bed

causing him to slide off onto the floor.

DORM HALLWAY

VERONICA storms into the hallway but slows down when she

sees she's attracting attention. She notices an incited

BRAD slither to the smiling DAVID who chats with some

STUDENTS, HEATHER CHANDLER on his arm.

BRAD causes DAVID's smile to ever-so-slightly diminish.

DAVID whispers to HEATHER CHANDLER who proceeds to set

down her beer and walk toward VERONICA.

DORMITORY ALLEY

The fire in the trashcan is raging.

DORM HALLWAY

A steel faced HEATHER CHANDLER comes face-to-face with VERONICA.

VERONICA'S eyes fall shut in a near-faint. She flings

herself down off-screen with some ugly retching sounds.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

VERONICA savagely scrawls in her diary, tears burning fierce.

DORM HALLWAY

VERONICA rises into view with tinges of vomit on her mouth.

A smile breaks across HEATHER CHANDLER's granite puss.

VERONICA runs off as STUDENTS laugh in the background.

DORMITORY ALLEY

VERONICA charges into the alley. She whips around to face a

screeching HEATHER CHANDLER. In back of VERONICA, the

trashcan bellows like Mt. Vesuvius.

The flickering flames cast HEATHER CHANDLER in a demonic light.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

VERONICA flings her diary across the room where it hits the

wall behind the stunning figure of J.D. VERONICA gasps.

VERONICA is simultaneously dismayed and exhilarated. She seems

ready to burst out all her anxieties but instead....

EXT.   THE SAWYER BACKYARD--LATE NIGHT

The viewer's viewpoint glides through the grass of Veronica's

backyard uncovering combinations of wickets and articles of

clothing. A pair of girls shoes and a pair of guys shoes rest

together by the first wicket.

Feminine socks and masculine socks lay crumpled by the next wicket.

As VERONICA quiveringly pauses, a stylish blouse and a

rugged shirt are revealed mingling by another wicket.

The viewer's viewpoint moves to a dress and a pair of jeans

resting side by side at another wicket.

VERONICA'S blue mallet has been staked into the ground. Her

panties hang on one end, J.D.'s underwear hangs on the other.

VERONICA and J.D. are finally revealed, entangled in an

artful pose upon J.D.'s gunslinger coat. They warmly kiss.

VERONICA breaks off to uneasily giggle.

J.D. gently bites in to VERONICA's neck. VERONICA grooves on

it, closing her eyes tightly.

VERONICA slides her head down against J.D.'s chest and

gracefully rests on his lap. Gently fighting slumber, she

murmurs up to J.D., who showers her face with slow kisses.

They laugh. VERONICA maneuvers herself into a sitting position.

INT.   HEATHER CHANDLER'S BEDROOM--DAY

HEATHER CHANDLER's bedroom is lushly and expensively

furnished with a glass coffee table as an eye-catching

centerpiece. HEATHER CHANDLER half-sleeps in twisted

bedsheets as MRS. CHANDLER sticks her head in the door.

As the door closes, HEATHER CHANDLER raises her arm and

gives her departed Mother "the finger."

INT.   THE CHANDLER KITCHEN--DAY

The sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before

VERONICA and J.D. burst through the door.

VERONICA opens the refrigerator. J.D. opens the cupboard

beneath the sink.

J.D. holds up a bottle of Pine-Sol.

VERONICA and J.D. make queasy eye-contact. VERONICA descends

back into the refrigerator with some worked-up enthusiasm as

J.D. suavely pours bits of various toxic containers (detergent,

scouring powder) into a glass beer mug.

J.D. raises the glass filled with what is now a strange blue

liquid. VERONICA stares at the glass, scared by her own thoughts.

J.D. pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the

poisonously blue beer glass contents into it. An eerie pause

ensues. VERONICA takes out a milk carton and a container of orange

juice. She struts back to the counter in anger, icily muttering.

J.D. sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup. VERONICA

tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange

juice into the cup.

They both start coughing harshly.

J.D. turns on his heel and slinks away. VERONICA glares down at

the mess of toxic containers. With both arms, VERONICA clumps

the toxic containers together and drops beneath the sink to put

them away. J.D. swaggers back into the kitchen as VERONICA bobs

back into view.

J.D. kisses the back of her neck. VERONICA closes her eyes

with a grudging smile.

VERONICA dreamily reaches out to one of the two ceramic cups.

Not the one with milk and orange juice in it.

HEATHER CHANDLER'S BEDROOM

HEATHER CHANDLER angelically sleeps as VERONICA and J.D. enter.

Like a lion, HEATHER CHANDLER rouses herself up.

J.D. holds out the ceramic cup. HEATHER CHANDLER snorts.

They do. They're right.

HEATHER CHANDLER rises from the bed and struts to J.D. in anger.

She takes the cup, slams her head back and downs it all. She then

launches her head forward, her face contorted in agony.

HEATHER CHANDLER'S eyes slam shut and her limp body crashes

through the glass coffee table. VERONICA and J.D. freeze.

VERONICA staggers to a desk. J.D. laughs out of shock.

VERONICA stares off as J.D. paces like a caged animal. He

scopes onto the rubble of the shattered coffee table and sees

Cliff Notes for

"THE FALL OF THE AMERICAN TEEN" sticking out from beneath

HEATHER CHANDLER's body.

VERONICA takes some stationery from the desk and begins

writing, calling out her words.

VERONICA's smile dies as she looks to HEATHER CHANDLER'S corpse.

INT.   SCHOOL CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

At the head of a long conference table is the bearlike

PRINCIPAL GOWAN. Circling the table is the gray-haired but

savvy MRS. POPE, the black counselor PAUL HYDE, the yuppie math

teacher KEVIN STAPLES, and most noticeably, the eccentrically

dressed MS. PAULINE FLEMING. Coats are in chairs and cigarette

smoke is in the air, as the group batters their way through a

morning mourning conference.

A collective sigh goes across the room.

INT.   PAULINE FLEMING'S CLASSROOM--DAY

The desks of the classroom have been maneuvered into an

amusingly chaotic position by PAULINE'S PUPILS. She is furious.

PAULINE melodramatically lifts the suicide note. The class AAAHS.

A stunned PAULINE glares until preppie PETER DAWSON speaks.

The note continues to be breathlessly passed around.

VERONICA lets out a laugh that she disguises as a sob by

putting her hands over her face.

The class stares to VERONICA as the suicide note is passed to

her. She acknowledges it in horror, passes it on, then continues,

realizing her ability to create truths for a captive audience.

PAULINE cries. The PUPILS applaud. VERONICA queasily smiles.

INT.   THE GIRLS LOCKER ROOM--DAY

The GIRLS are finishing up putting on their clothes.

HEATHER DUKE gnaws on a chicken leg as she speaks.

HEATHER MCNAMARA pulls a Swatch from one of the lockers.

HEATHER MCNAMARA tosses the watch to a spooked VERONICA who

stands up and solemnly puts it on. The FEMALE STONER IN ARMY

JACKET stops next to their bench.

HEATHER DUKE bobs up from the world's largest sno-cone.

VERONICA zombiesquely moves into the shower area.

THE SHOWER

VERONICA turns on a shower and lets the water spray against

her clothes.

THE LOCKER ROOM

The SQUEALING GIRL runs into the shower fully clothed. TWO

GIGGLING GIRLS follow suit. The HEATHERS look to each other,

laugh, and run in.

INT.   THE GIRLS' COACH'S LOCKER ROOM OFFICE

Heavy Metalers MATT, CLYDE, and STEVE plus Geek RODNEY sneak

into a darkened room. Girls' laughter drifts in.

MATT pulls a curtain revealing a semi-overhead view of the

showering and clothed GIRLS.

THE SHOWER

The GIRLS splash and spin in balletlike slow motion. VERONICA

stands facing the viewer, the Swatch noticeably attached.

THE GIRLS' COACH'S LOCKER ROOM OFFICE

Cautiously quiet pandemonium.

EXT.   OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL--DAY

Pulling their coats over their wet clothes, VERONICA and the

HEATHERS come out of the school.

In the distance, a T.V. CAMERA CREW is interviewing STUDENTS.

HEATHER DUKE dashes toward them. HEATHER MCNAMARA freezes.

HEATHER MCNAMARA moans, vibrates, then suddenly races toward

the cameras. VERONICA looks down at the soaked, stopped Swatch

on her arm. She takes it off and drops it in a nearby trashcan.

INT. THE DEAN LIVING ROOM--LATE AFTERNOON

A massive T.V. set shows the image of HEATHER DUKE

posed by a tree, talking into a microphone.

The image of HEATHER MCNAMARA sitting in the grass talking

into a microphone supersedes HEATHER DUKE's.

The image of PETER DAWSON sitting on a rock comes on next.

VERONICA and J.D. are seen to be crashed on a couch. J.D.

pushes a button on the remote control, cutting the sound.

The silent image of HEATHER DUKE on a staircase talking into a

microphone is on the screen.

Country Club Courtney appears wearing a T-shirt reading BIGFUN.

VERONICA takes the remote and turns the sound on.

J.D. suddenly looks away from VERONICA with a mischievous

half-smile. He inexplicably calls out.

J.D.'s father FRED DEAN, stands before them, handsome

and threatening in a shirt and tie. He is rather

malevolently holding a rowing machine.

FRED DEAN slams down his rowing machine and straddles it

before answering his own question. He rows as he speaks.

J.D. turns to VERONICA with a bemused smile.

VERONICA, with a forced smile, reaches to shaked FRED's hand.

FRED DEAN extends his hand but makes no effort to stop rowing

hence his hand pulls away from VERONICA. Pop and son laugh.

BIG BUD DEAN stops rowing to grin a You-Think-You're-Tougher-

Than-Me-But-You're-Not smile to J.D.

EXT.   THE SAWYER PATIO--DUSK

Just as in the earlier patio scene, DAD and MOM SAWYER are

seated at a patio table with an empty chair between them.

Pate is on the table. DAD smokes a cigarette.

VERONICA walks into view and sits down.

DAD immediately takes another drag with a wide grin.

INT.   HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--DAY

A montage commences showing the HEATHERS preparing for the funeral.

HEATHER MCNAMARA models an all-black outfit in front of a

dressing table mirror. She storms away, pouting.

INT.   HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM--DAY

Bobbing up from a fashion magazine whose cover story is FUNERAL

CHIC, HEATHER DUKE finishes applying black lipstick. A look of

horror passes over her face and she savagely scrubs her lips.

INT.   CHURCH--DAY

A MORTICIAN puts the finishing touches on HEATHER CHANDLER,

smoothing out her clothes and buffing her face. He gently

kisses her forehead then quickly rebuffs the spot.

HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM

HEATHER MCNAMARA models another black outfit. She responds

this time with a satisfied smile.

HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM

Traditionally made up, a smiling HEATHER DUKE brings a

crucifix earring to her ear and attaches it.

INT.   CHURCH--DAY

HEATHER CHANDLER serenely lies in a coffin as FATHER FAUST

bellows off-screen. A panorama of ADULTS and STUDENTS is

revealed at this more social than spiritual event. VERONICA

and J.D. watch from the back pew.

The bald FATHER FAUST finally comes into view.

KNEELING PODIUM BEFORE COFFIN--LATER

BETTY FINN is kneeling before HEATHER CHANDLER'S open

coffin. The viewer hears what she is thinking.

BETTY FINN makes the sign of the cross, rises, and exits.

HEATHER MCNAMARA takes her place on the kneeling podium.

HEATHER MCNAMARA exits and PETER DAWSON moves in her place.

PETER flees and RAM uncomfortably takes his place.

RAM clumsily exits. HEATHER DUKE solemnly kneels in his place.

HEATHER DUKE departs and VERONICA kneels in her place.

CHURCH LOBBY

HEATHER MCNAMARA dips a big comb in the holy water basin and

then combs out her hair. VERONICA breezes by.

EXT.   CHURCH PARKING LOT--DAY

KURT KELLY and RAM stand by RAM'S van.

Geeks RODNEY, FAT CYNIC, and BRACES thrust by KURT and RAM.

BRACES obliviously steps on KURT's foot.

BRACES gives them "the finger".

KURT and RAM turn to each other more amused than angered.

The bolting Jocks effortlessly catch BRACES and put him into a

hunched-over position. The other Geeks look on, ashamed.

RAM pushes BRACES down harder.

J.D. rides by on his motorcycle. He turns to watch KURT,

wearing an overwhelmingly tinted motorcycle helmet that

reads THE TRUE KILLER across the top. KURT is spooked.

Unamused, RAM throws BRACES to the ground. BRACES semi-cries.

ANOTHER PLACE IN THE PARKING LOT

VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA sashay through the parking lot.

Moving into the background, BRACES wipes dirt and blood off

his face as his friends glumly watch on.

EXT.   COW PASTURE--NIGHT

A COW stands sleeping. Giggling and drunk, KURT and RAM

scramble around the COW. Uncomfortable and sober, VERONICA

and HEATHER MCNAMARA look on.

KURT and RAM slam their knuckles and then lean against the

COW, poised to shove. HEATHER MCNAMARA manages a smile but

VERONICA glares it away.

An O.S. Moo and the Jocks' laughter is heard as mud splashes

against the mortified faces of VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA.

DEEPER IN THE PASTURE--LATER IN THE NIGHT

KURT stumbles after a more annoyed than scared VERONICA.

VERONICA makes her way up a hill, pausing to compassionately

stare at RAM on top of a dispirited HEATHER MCNAMARA. KURT's

intoxicated brain has trouble dealing with the incline.

Majestically, J.D. appears at the top of the hill. KURT

squints up the hill and falls over backwards.

VERONICA clumsily high heels it up the hill.

J.D. solemnly reaches toward VERONICA. She, less solemn,

takes his hand. Their bodies disappear over the hill.

INT.   NEWSPAPER/YEARBOOK WORKSHOP--DAY

In a cluttered school workshop, Editor DENNIS and a YEARBOOK

GIRL, wearing a BIGFUN T-shirt, confer over a layout sheet.

Dennis's Famine Fund partner PETER DAWSON pouts behind them.

VERONICA breezes in.

Country Club COURTNEY and COURTNEY'S FRIEND come in giggling

and whispering. Seeing VERONICA, they stop dead, then slide

into chairs, laughing softly.

COURTNEY and COURTNEY'S FRIEND explode in laughter.

More laughter.

HALLWAY OUTSIDE WORKSHOP

PETER tells VERONICA.

Dizzy, VERONICA hands a clump of dollar bills to PETER.

PETER cheerfully pockets the cash as VERONICA drifts off.

INT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAY

VERONICA arousingly speaks into her phone.

Revealed to be lounging on her bed, J.D. laughs out loud.

VERONICA throws a book at him.

INT.  THE KELLY KITCHEN--DAY

KURT hangs up with an amazed expression on his face.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

VERONICA and J.D. load guns on VERONICA's bed. VERONICA

breaks into a laugh.

VERONICA drops her gun in revulsion and launches off her bed.

With a patient smile, J.D. pulls her back down.

J.D. flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber.

J.D. nods then stands to pace the room, his mind whirring.

VERONICA clumsily extracts the note from her purse. She also

plucks out the crumpled yellow sample of Kurt's handwriting of

the opening note-forge scene. She proudly displays both

papers.

VERONICA pulls back the note and reads.

VERONICA swiftly picks up her gun and aims it at the lovable

tabby entering the room. J.D. rips it away from her.

J.D. lifts up a feminine shopping bag and gently dumps the

contents on the bed.

J.D. reaches in both his coat pockets and triumphantly

raises out two bottles of Perrier water.

J.D. laughs then climbs onto VERONICA for a hugging kiss.

EXT.   SCHOOL PARKING LOT--NIGHT

A tense KURT and an excited RAM, playing air guitar, walk

through the parking lot toward the woods.

KURT feebly slams knuckles with RAM.

EXT.   CLEARING IN THE WOODS--NIGHT

VEONICA stands in the middle of a clearing in the woods.

She nervously tucks the gun in the back of her dress as KURT

and RAM emerge into the clearing from a path in the woods.

RAM smacks his hands together.

KURT steps into the scratched-in-the-dirt circle next to him.

A confused RAM walks past VERONICA and steps into a circle at

the opposite end of the foggy clearing.

The guys pause, then slowly start taking off their clothes.

KURT and RAM awkwardly stand at opposite ends in their undies.

RAM giggles in anticipation.

KURT finally cracks a smile.

J.D. suddenly moves next to VERONICA holding a gun in his

right hand and the feminine shopping bag in his left.

J.D. almost non-chalantly shoots RAM in the forehead.

VERONICA rips out her gun and swings it toward KURT. Using

both hands, she fires, but misses completely. KURT runs

away onto the path. VERONICA throws down her gun with a smile.

J.D. races to VERONICA in a white sweat.

VERONICA's laughter cuts off like a faucet. Suddenly trembling

and confused, she watches J.D. bolt into the woods.

THE PATH

A panicked KURT runs on the path through the woods.

OFF THE PATH

J.D., with a cold efficiency, weaves through trees.

THE CLEARING

VERONICA turns toward Ram's collapsed body.

THE PATH

KURT sees the opening at the end of the woods. J.D. suddenly

moves into the light at the end of the woods and raises his gun.

KURT runs back the other way with a strangled moan.

THE CLEARING

VERONICA approaches Ram's body with increasing shivers. He

does not look bleeding and unconscious. He looks bleeding

and dead, dead, dead.

KURT barrels into the clearing as J.D. howls from the woods.

In a burst of frightened, animal instinct, VERONICA whips

around and fires her gun right into KURT's chest.

SQUAD CAR IN SCHOOL PARKING LOT

Two cops, MILNER and McCORD, smoke marijuana in a squad car

already filled with smoke. After a coughing fit, MILNER shouts.

The two officer explode out of the car.

THE CLEARING

J.D. puts his gun in RAM's right hand while VERONICA

zombiesquely does the same with KURT and her gun.

A quivering VERONICA puts the gun in KURT's left hand.

J.D.'s head snaps forward. He yanks up VERONICA. They both run

into the woods behind RAM's body as the two Cops charge into

the clearing, guns raised. Seeing the Jocks, they stop.

MILNER looks toward where VERONICA and J.D. ran out.

MILNER runs off as McCORD shouts into a walkie-talkie. He is

holding the pulse of KURT KELLY.

IN THE WOODS

VERONICA and J.D. flow through the trees. An Owl hoos.

ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS

MILNER blindly barrels through the woods.

JUST OUTSIDE THE WOODS

VERONICA and J.D. come out of the woods and start running up

a grassy hill toward VERONICA's car which is parked on top.

IN THE WOODS

MILNER is jolted by an OWL-HOO, then continues moving.

THE HILL

VERONICA and J.D. reach the car, panting.

MILNER races out of the woods just as VERONICA and J.D. slam

the car doors closed behind them. MILNER huffs up the hill.

THE SAWYER CAR

VERONICA and J.D. somersault into the backseat and begin

taking off their clothes.

THE HILL

MILNER continues to move up the hill.

THE SAWYER CAR

VERONICA and J.D., stripped down to their underwear, embrace.

OUTSIDE THE CAR

MILNER approaches the car and peers in. His crackling walkie-

talkie startles him.

MILNER moves away from the car, then speaks into his walkie-talkie.

THE SAWYER CAR

Seeing the cop move away. VERONICA and J.D. stop kissing. They

catch their breath, smile, then continue passionately necking.

THE CLEARING

MILNER runs back into the clearing.

McCORD reaches in the feminine shopping bag and pulls out the

bottles of Perrier water.

MILNER shakes his head slowly then suddenly looks up.

INT.   SCHOOL CONFERENCE ROOM--MORNING

Another morning mourning conference. The participants look a

little more frazzled. PAULINE sits at the head of the table.

The elderly MRS. POPE shakes her head at the suicide note.

PRINCIPAL GOWAN hoarsely breaks in.

EXT.   STUDENT PARKING LOT--MORNING

VERONICA's car is the lone vehicle in the student parking lot.

THE SAWYER CAR

A battered VERONICA climbs into the front seat, pulling on her

blazer. She presses in the car cigarette lighter. J.D. rumbles

from the back as other cars begin to fill the lot.

VERONICA tugs out the car lighter and savagely brands the palm

of her hand. J.D. hurdles into the front seat and bats the

lighter away. He lights a cigarette off the scorched flesh

of VERONICA's hand as she wails away.

J.D. drags on his cigarette. School buses are pulling in

outside of the parking lot, in front of the school.

J.D. launches into a rapid-fire rendition of "did-to's".

VERONICA responds by holding her hands over her ears and

singing "We're Off to See the Wizard." J.D.'s "did-to's"

get louder causing VERONICA to bang on the horn.

PARKING LOT

HEATHER DUKE and a vegged out HEATHER MCNAMARA stop sauntering

through the parking lot to contemplate Veronica's hiccuping car

and its sparring occupants.

The SQUEALING GIRL bounds up to the Heathers.

THE SAWYER CAR

J.D. pulls VERONICA off the horn and warmly places an unlit

cigarette in her mouth. As he speaks, VERONICA wearily takes

the cigarette from her mouth and puts it in her blazer pocket.

STUDENTS head back to their cars and the Buses pull back out.

EXT.   CEMETERY GROUNDS--DAY

A typically John Waynesque Jock's Father-type, MR. KELLY,

stands over his son's open grave. FATHER FAUST and a

seated mixture of ADULTS and STUDENTS watch on.

In dark sunglasses, VERONICA wearily leans over to J.D.

They quietly laugh. VERONICA sees a LITTLE GIRL staring at her.

She is wearing Kurt's football jersey and her face is soaked

in tears. VERONICA's smile turns into a nauseated grimace.

INT.  SAWYER LIVING ROOM--NIGHT

Still in stylish funeral garb and dark sunglasses, VERONICA

collapses onto her couch, splaying next to her MOM. The

Sawyer T.V. flashes against Veronica's shades.

A young, statuesque blonde appears on-screen. A Super

reading WHITNEY JAMES-W.E.T.C. COMMENTARY flashes on.

A shiny number three flashes on and off in the screen's corner.

The camera pans to an affable ANCHORMAN.

INT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA lies on the floor next to a Vodka bottle. She

drinks out of a Dixie cup as she talks on the phone.

VERONICA hangs up and looks to her battered diary lying

against the wall. She crawls to the diary and then reaches

up to her night table to pull down her monocle and a pen.

She sucks a cup of Vodka and begins writing.

Sitting up against her bed, VERONICA continues writing as

J.F.K. laps up Vodka from the Dixie cup.

VERONICA drops her head back and closes her eyes, popping

out her monocle. She swoons down against the bed onto the

floor and curls into a fetal slumber.

THE CAFETERIA

STUDENTS eat and buzz together in typical cacophony. All are

wearing black armbands. A jukebox roars.

PAULINE FLEMING and an entourage of STUDENTS such as PETER

DAWSON and the HEATHERS invade the cafeteria, heads raised high.

As the jukebox amusingly grinds to a halt, PAULINE hoists up

a bullhorn to her lips and crackles...

A startled Geek RODNEY splatters milk all over himself.

STUDENTS whip their heads around to the front of the cafeteria.

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK warily looks up from her plate.

PAULINE FLEMING chants with soaring self-importance.

A tableau of dumbfounded STUDENTS stare at the Bullhorn Woman.

INT.   MAIN HALLWAY--SAME TIME

Hungover in dark sunglasses, VERONICA stumbles down the hall. She

stops to read a sign plastered on a wall: THE NEW HAPPINESS-

A Special Lunchtime Announcement Ala Pauline Fleming. VERONICA

takes off her sunglasses, squints, then continues down the hall.

THE CAFETERIA

PAULINE's Evita Peron-like composure is crumbling.

Cheers raucously emerge from the enlivened students.

The STUDENTS make loud, scattered rumblings of the word "No."

PAULINE hungrily unbuttons her paisley blazer.

Frightened and flustered by the fanatic camaraderie around her,

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK quakes for a moment then crawls

underneath her table.

Fingering her bangs in an attempt at composure, VERONICA steps

into the cafeteria and her fellow students boom.

As a blown away VERONICA takes in the panorama of students

from different cliques chanting to the beat of PAULINE's

gospel recital, PAULINE's voice is replaced on the

soundtrack by the evocative female moanings of the opening scene.

J.D., also wearing a black armband, stalks VERONICA from

behind. His hand unzips her dress.

The female voices swell louder as a glowing VERONICA takes in

glorious images. Geek BRACES and a JOCK chant together, standing

on chairs. HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEAVY METALER MATT look to each

other dubiously then mindlessly shout out. A MORRISONESQUE

STONER dances on a table of cheering BETTY-FINN-A-LIKES.

J.D. slides his hand through the opening in Veronica's dress.

The female voices cut off as the spell over VERONICA breaks.

She swings her elbow into J.D.'s stomach.

VERONICA spins to an electric PAULINE FLEMING glistening in the

mouth of the cafeteria, flanked by HEATHER DUKE and PETER DAWSON.

J.D. looks out through the cafeteria. He sees Martha poke her

head out from beneath her lunch table then dart back under.

J.D. moves away from the chattering group.

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE

MARTHA slithers from under the table up into her seat, and head

down, trys to finish off a bowl of soup. She slowly looks up and

freezes. J.D. is revealed to be seated across from her, behind his

Rebel Without a Cause lunch box. He smiles warmly.

INT.   J.D.'S LIVING ROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA beams and babbles over the room while on the couch,

J.D. restlessly works his channel changer.

J.D. comically cups his hands together to holler.

VERONICA throws the first thing she can get her hands on, a

framed picture of a woman, at the roaring J.D.

FRED DEAN is revealed to be standing in the front doorway,

holding a chest exerciser and waving a videocassette.

FRED DEAN crams the cassette in his V.C.R. and hefts up a chest

exerciser. He begins pumping away as the image of a shabby

building appears on the massive T.V.

The building blows up. FRED DEAN cackles. J.D. politely

applauds. FRED pops out the videocassette and bounces away.

J.D. picks up the framed picture that Veronica threw.

VERONICA slowly sits down next to J.D. with dazed concern.

J.D. exhales in frustration and changes some more channels.

THE T.V. SCREEN

A music video flashes on the Dead T.V. screen. THREE GORGEOUS

WOMEN, stylishly furnished, evocatively wail the female moans

heard throughout the film. The video viewpoint then pans to

two overly gorgeous young men wearing trendy hair and trendy

clothes. They sing/shout before an all-white background. A

SUPER in the corner reads BIGFUN/TEENAGE SUICIDE (DON'T DO IT).

VIDEO:   INT.   A GIRL'S BEDROOM--DAY

Now in full screen, the video viewpoint cuts to a very depressed

and very cute, white, female VID VICTIM ONE sitting at her

dressing table. She pours a bottle of pills into her hand.

BIGFUN magically materialize next to VID VICTIM ONE. The pills

in her hand have turned into jellybeans. She is ridiculously happy.

J.D. pulls out a gun with an ethereal expression on his face.

J.D. fires into the radiant image of BIGFUN, destroying the

T.V. and disgusting VERONICA, who bolts off the couch. He

raucously crawls after her.

J.D. playfully tackles VERONICA. This calms rather than angers.

She turns on her back. J.D. follows suit.

VERONICA sighs, then rolls over into a crawling position and

eventually into a walking-out-the-door position.

J.D. bounds up to a kitchen counter and flicks on a small T.V.

BIGFUN can be heard booming their song. J.D. broods.

INT.   EMPTY CLASSROOM--DAY

J.D. moves to an empty row of desks. He turns the first desk as

to face the second. HEATHER DUKE warily lowers herself into the

second desk as J.D. flops a manilla envelope onto it. HEATHER

DUKE opens the envelope and pulls out a stack of 8 by 10's.

She gasps.

The first shot shows a YOUNG HEATHER DUKE in a summer camp

uniform that vibrantly reads HEATHER, She is holding one end

of a large poster board drawing of two Eskimos rubbing noses.

Holding the other end, in a summer camp uniform vibrantly

reading MARTHA, is a YOUNG MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK.

With a harsh laugh, she takes in the next photograph. It has

YOUNG HEATHER DUKE and YOUNG MARTHA eating toasted

marshmallows off each other's sticks.

J.D. laughs. She's on the ball.

J.D. launches away from his desk with a grin. He places a

red ribbon on HEATHER DUKE's desk.

INT.   THE GIRLS BATHROOM

A spooked HEATHER DUKE splashes water on her face and looks up

into the mirror. In a trance, she pulls her hair back Heather

Chandler fashion and ties it with the ribbon J.D. gave her.

A BETTY FINN-A-LIKE moves up to the sink beside her. Two CHIC

BABES enter the bathroom with pouting expressions. Seemingly

in a trance, HEATHER DUKE bends over and wipes off her wet

hands using the oblivious BETTY FINN-A-LIKE's dress. HEATHER

DUKE winks to the now-giggling CHIC BABES and saunters off.

HALLWAY

HEATHER DUKE bursts through the bathroom door to wickedly

strut down the hall. She scowls/smiles in perfect Heather

Chandler fashion to various passers-by.

EARL FRAZIER'S LOCKER

VERONICA genially lobbys the big black EARL FRAZIER.

VERONICA hands him a Guest Pass tag.

HEATHER DUKE impishly blinds VERONICA with her hands.

HEATHER DUKE lets go with a small giggle. VERONICA turns to

face her Heather Chandler-looking friend and her smile dies.

VERONICA violently pushes HEATHER DUKE away and storms off.

INT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

Lying on the floor, VERONICA concentrates on her phone. With

a deep sigh, she pushbuttons out a number. She pauses, then...

INT.   HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM

VERONICA's voice drones through HEATHER DUKE's answering machine.

A Male hand picks up the phone. It's College boy DAVID.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

VERONICA cringes.

HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM

DAVID proudly looks down off-screen to his lap.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

VERONICA slams down the receiver and pulls up a sleek leather

address book. She severely scans through it. Tossing it away,

VERONICA then descends into the sundry junk of her night

table drawer and draws up another address book; this one is

frayed and pink polka-dotted. She peruses it and dials.....

EXT.   SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY

BETTY FINN hits her ball through a wicket and squeals in

delight. VERONICA has a motherly smile on her face.

BETTY bends down to shoot then raises her body back up.

BETTY once again bends and raises.

BETTY finally shoots. Feebly.

VEONCIA gigglingly shoots, but misses the wicket. And instead

hits BETTY's ball. Disturbed by the sudden dilemma, she

determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from BETTY's.

VERONICA sighs then knocks BETTY's adjacent ball sailing

toward the porch and a statuesque HEATHER DUKE who does

not budge as the ball whizzes past her.

HEATHER DUKE walks toward the girls followed by a meandering

desultory HEATHER MCNAMARA, who picks up a green mallet and

fragilely swings it; her early robustness a forgotten memory.

HEATHER DUKE hustles back toward a passing BETTY FINN.

LATER IN THE GAME

HEATHER DUKE's red ball slams into HEATHER MCNAMARA's green one.

HEATHER DUKE savagely "sends" HEATHER MACNAMARA's ball into

the flower bed.

HEATHER DUKE's shot swerves wide of the wicket.

VERONICA blows her shot.

HEATHER DUKE bashes her ball into VERONICA's and prepares

to send it.

As HEATHER DUKE swings down her mallet, VERONICA steps on her

own ball. When HEATHER DUKE's mallet makes contact, the two

balls slam against each other, unmoving, with a loud smack.

The depressed and disoriented HEATHER MCNAMARA, laying

against a tree, pipes in.

INT.  WETC T.V. STATION--DUSK

In a sleek WETC station hallway, VERONICA SAWYER, a Guest Pass

affixed to her heart, holds her hand in a spurting drinking

fountain. She watches the water splash her car lighter burn-mark.

PETER DAWSON beams toward her, wearing a Guest Pass.

VERONICA looks at her watch then joins PETER's march down the hall.

They burst through the studio double doors.

STUDIO

VERONICA and PETER take in a panorama of attractive, clean-cut

STUDENTS from various schools chatting near Wine and Cheese

tables set up to the side of an impressive, elevated,

circular stage. All STUDENTS are wearing pink armbands.

Out of nowhere, a bubbling HEATHER DUKE knots a pink armband

around PETER's arm with a giggle.

PETER DAWSON prances off with a raucous laugh. VERONICA stares

dumbfounded at the wicked homogeneity of the STUDENTS as HEATHER

DUKE ties a pink armband on her.

HEATHER DUKE tugs VERONICA across the crowded studio floor to

where the WETC news set is situated. Smoking casually in her

anchor's chair is the beautiful WHITNEY JAMES.

HEATHER DUKE glides away. VERONICA uncomfortably steps onto

the news set and moves down next to WHITNEY JAMES.

WINE AND CHEESE TABLE

HEATHER MCNAMARA surreptitiously picks up a bottle of wine and

with a sad expression, proceeds to down it.

THE NEWS SET

VERONICA apologizes to a blissfully oblivious WHITNEY JAMES.

WHITNEY JAMES tears open a bag of Corn Nuts and showers some

into her mouth. She speaks as she sucks and chews.

WHITNEY JAMES titters. VERONICA is a statue of mortification.

EXT.   THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--TWILIGHT

In the neighborhood park, gloomy members of various cliques sit

in silence at picnic tables. All are ludicrously wearing

Guest Passes. BETTY FINN mumbles down to her potato salad.

EARL FRAZIER stoically stares off into space. Heavy Metaler

CLYDE holds an absurdly large picnic basket.

NEWS SET

Completely flabbergasted, VERONICA manages a light tone.

STUDIO FLOOR

Sickened, VERONICA stumbles onto the studio floor. Studio

lights suddenly pop on, momentarily blinding her. PAULINE

grabs VERONICA by the arm and shouts into the air.

THE STAGE

The pink armbanded Aryan youths form a circle on the circular stage.

Pauline moves to a microphone at the center stage beside a

seated WHITNEY JAMES who's tuning her electric guitar.

VERONICA helplessly stands between the circle of STUDENTS and

the two female hosts as the cameras go on. PAULINE sings/speaks

into the microphone while WHITNEY JAMES strums her guitar.

The students sthereally reach out to each other and clasp

hands. VERONICA quivers for a moment then bursts through

a handholding HEATHER DUKE and HEATHER MCNAMARA and off the stage.

VERONICA swaggers past a seated TECHNICIAN. He pushes up a

console lever causing the outer edge of the stage, where the

circle of hand-holding students is, to slowly spin around

the singing PAULINE and the strumming WHITNEY JAMES.

Ripping off her pink armband, VERONICA freezes. Standing at

the wine and cheese table, gunslinger coat and all, is J.D.

He turns around and raises his wine glass for a gleeful toast.

Devastated,  VERONICA sways back toward the TECHNICIAN's console.

VERONICA slams the lever back down forcing the spinning circle

of handholding, pink-armbanded STUDENTS to crash to the ground

around a taken-aback PAULINE and WHITNEY JAMES.

WHITNEY JAMES playfully lets off a Hendrixian riff before

coolly leaning over to her microphone.

OUTSIDE STUDIO DOORS

VERONICA bursts through the studio doors, panting rapidly. She

kicks off her shoes and begins to jog barefoot through the

station hallway, weaving through various REPORTER-types.

EXT.  OUTSIDE T.V. STATION--TWILIGHT

VERONICA pops out the studio door, running faster.

GRAVELLY ROAD

She sprints down the side of a road. Her bare feet pound

against sharp pebbles.

THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARK

VERONICA now barrels through the neighborhood park. She looks

to her outcast classmates. In tableau, they stare back. BETTY

FINN on a park carousel spins in and out of view.

PROMENADE

VERONICA speeds past the shops and the movie theatre. The viewer

remains at the theatre ticket booth as MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK

wearing a BIGFUN T-shirt, pushes three dollars through the

ticket window to a bored female cashier.

MARTHA puts two crumpled bucks through the window. The

CASHIER shines a cruelly patronizing smile.

INT. SAWYER FAMILY/T.V. ROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA huffs and puffs into her family room where her MOM and

DAD are watching T.V.

VERONICA half-bitterly laughs at the irony.

INT.  MOVIE THEATRE

The light of the screen flickers on an overwhelmingly sullen

MARTHA. She moves her leg and knocks a large Coke across the

floor. She tragically stares at the Cola pool.

SAWYER FAMILY/T.V. ROOM

A DAN RATHER VOICE booms from the T.V. The SAWYERS stare.

VERONICA snaps off the T.V.

VERONICA leans against the wall with a melancholy smile.

MOM is embarassed for getting so involved. She meekly

gestures to a tray of pate with a compassionate smile.

HEATHER DUKE suddenly breezes in the room.

VERONICA slaps HEATHER DUKE in the face.

INT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

HEATHER DUKE paces the room holding an icepack to her jaw.

VERONICA is on the ground wiping off her bloodied feet.

VERONICA rubs her feet. HEATHER DUKS shakes her head.

HEATHER DUKE hastens to the radio and flicks it on. Ripping

open a bag of corn nuts, she sets herself down next to

VERONICA as a TROUBLED MALE VOICE cuts the air.

INT.   RADIO STATION BOOTH

A slob D.J. cackles into a W.E.T.C. conference call-type box.

The D.J. rudely clicks off the TROUBLED MALE VOICE.

INT.    HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

HEATHER MCNAMARA is sitting clandestinely on her bedroom

floor talking on the phone and through her radio. A dim

Minnie Mouse lamp provides the room's only light.

HEATHER MCNAMARA looks up at a Madonna poster on the wall.

HEATHER MCNAMARA looks up to her Minnie Mouse lamp.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

VERONICA and HEATHER DUKE simultaneously move into stunned

kneeling positions, half-realizing who the caller is...

RADIO STATION BOOTH

The D.J. looks to the conference call box with exasperation.

HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM

A broken-down HEATHER MCNAMARA sobs.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

HEATHER DUKE excitedlly jumps up as HEATHER MCNAMARA drones on.

INT.   CLASSROOM--DAY

A blackboard reads POOR LITTLE HEATHER.

HEATHER MCNAMARA is revealed in the front row wearing her

cheerleader uniform. To the left, HEATHER DUKE dishes with

some dreamy GUYS. At the back of the classroom, VERONICA,

monocle in eye, writes in her diary.

A HOMELY GIRL is seen reading a note, glancing to a TYPICAL JOCK.

VERONICA takes in the wicked panorama of the classroom.

HEATHER MCNAMARA suddenly rises and walks out of the classroom,

passing a GRUFF TEACHER in a trenchcoat, carrying a briefcase.

INT.   GIRLS BATHROOM--DAY

HEATHER MCNAMARA struggles to open a bottle of sleeping pills.

THE GRUFF TEACHER'S CLASSROOM

GRUFF TEACHER writes a math problem on the board. A flustered

VERONICA squirms in her seat then leaps up and runs to the door.

GIRLS BATHROOM

The bottle is smashed open. A palmful of pills is poured out.

HALLWAY

VERONICA races down the hall.

GIRLS BATHROOM

HEATHER MCNAMARA is a chipmunk with a mouthful of pills.

She pulls a glass from her purse and turns on a faucet, but

no water comes out. She manages to mumble.

HEATHER MCNAMARA gets running water from another sink as

VERONICA rushes in. VERONICA punches HEATHER MCNAMARA's

face causing the pills to explode out of her mouth.

HEATHER MCNAMARA slumps against a stall, onto the floor.

VERONICA jumps up and down on the pills on the floor.

VERONICA lunges forward to strike her. HEATHER MCNAMARA

recoils with a wail. Half-regaining her composure,

VERONICA slides down next to HEATHER MCNAMARA.

HEATHER MCNAMARA wipes tears from her eyes and smiles weakly.

INT.   THE EMPTY CLASSROOM--DAY

Comfortably slouched at a desk, J.D. laconically rumbles.

HEATHER DUKE sits at the desk opposite him torching

manilla envelopes (photographs) with a butane lighter.

J.D. flips across a stack of blank, connected computer printout

sheets. At the top is a small paragraph and the word PETITION.

HEATHER DUKE blows ashes off her desk and grabs it, giggling.

HEATHER DUKE twirls her copy of Catcher in the Rye to a pleased J.D.

INT.   STAIRCASE WINDOW--DAY

HEATHER DUKE gothically ascends a staircase, holding the

petition. She stops, arms raised high, to bathe in the

sunlight blasting through the staircase window.

INT.   CAFETERIA--DAY

HEATHER DUKE, petition in hand, sashays toward the

Country Club Kids table.

INT.   SCHOOL BUS--DAY

HEATHER DUKE chirps to a schoolbusful of various STUDENTS.

EXT.   BLEACHERS--DAY

The provocatively dressed Petitioner charms a bleacher of Jocks.

STAIRCASE WINDOW

HEATHER DUKE continues to bizarrely bathe in the sunlight of

the staircase window.

INT.   FAST FOOD RESTAURANT--NIGHT

Now in Heavy Metal gear, HEATHER DUKE slams down the petition

atop a booth of Metalheads.

INT.   THE SMOKE-FILLED HALLWAY--DAY                                   139

Decked out in denim, HEATHER DUKE vanishes into the Stoner

Hallway smoke, with the petition.

THE STAIRCASE WINDOW

HEATHER DUKE further writhes in the sunlight until

VERONICA's perplexed voice cuts into her bliss.

HEATHER DUKE brings down her arms and the petition and turns

to VERONICA, revealed to be descending down the steps.

VERONICA slaps HEATHER DUKE with all her might.

HEATHER DUKE stumbles down the stairs. J.D.'s voice cuts

into VERONICA's concentration.

VERONICA grimly turns to see a smirking, descending J.D.

VERONICA somberly steps forward to J.D., grabs his elbows, then

pulls him gently, seemingly for a kiss. She spits in his face

and bolts down the stairs, calling up to him.

INT.   SAWYER LIVING ROOM--DUSK

Intensely clutching her schoolbooks, VERONICA walks through the

front door into the living room where MOM and DAD sit with

aggressively compassionate faces. VERONICA is a bit confused.

MOM and DAD glance at each other before MOM speaks.

DAD holds out an envelope. VERONICA nabs it and rips it open.

The note reads, in feminine manuscript: RECOGNIZE THE HANDWRITING?

VERONICA runs off, her mother's voice trailing behind her.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

VERONICA vaults through her bedroom door. A Barbie doll wearing

a BigFun T-shirt hangs from a noose. With a whimper, she

swerves away from it and dives onto her bed.

EXT.   OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOUSE--NIGHT

J.D. laconically leans against his motorcycle with his legs

suavely crossed. He looks up to Veronica's bedroom window and

hears another whimper emerge. He puts a cigarette in his mouth

and lights it with a smile.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

VERONICA curls into a fetal position on her bed and closes her

eyes.....tighter and tighter as J.D.'s voice.

VERONICA flops around to see J.D. kneeling over her on her bed

reading Heather Duke's copy of The Catcher in the Rye.

J.D. giddily underlines words then slides into a prone

position, tossing the book to an enraged VERONICA.

VERONICA freezes and J.D. reaches up to her hand where she

holds the Catcher in the Rye. Her index finger is curled into

the book. Sitting up, J.D. carefully opens the book at that

place and peers in.

J.D. obliviously underlines the word then pulls the flailing

VERONICA up like an enthusiastic camp counselor.

INT.   THE DUKE KITCHEN--NIGHT

The sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before

VERONICA and J.D. burst through the door. J.D. moves to the

dishwasher and opens it like a burglar opening a safe.

J.D. grabs a dishtowel and vigorously wipes off the knife.

She can and so can the viewer. Tears well in VERONICA's eyes.

She begins to shudder, a shattered smile quaking on her face.

J.D. tears his gloves off with a giggle. He takes a pen from

the kitchen counter and paper from a cutesy memo pad. He

shoves the pen in VERONICA's hand and grabbing her hand,

forces her to scribble LIFE SUCKS on the paper.

J.D. pulls out the copy of the Catcher in the Rye and opens a

door revealing HEATHER DUKE, asleep in an artful pose on a

couch, MTV images from the T.V. flashing against her.

J.D. hops in the adjoinging room and slams the door. VERONICA

races to the door wailing. She maniacally rattles the doorknob

trying to open the locked door.

INT.   AN ANOYNYMOUS T.V.

The sound of the rattling doorknob subtly turns into wild

African music thundering on the soundtrack as WHITNEY JAMES,

in a T.V. screen, maniacally addresses the viewer. A shiny

number 4 flashes on and off in the corner.

INT.   NEWSPAPER/YEARBOOK WORKSHOP--DAY

In speeded-up imagery, DENNIS, PETER, and the YEARBOOK GIRL

manuever pictures of HEATHER CHANDLER, KURT, RAM, and HEATHER

DUKE in mind-bogglingly countless ways in order to accomodate

them all on the same two page layout.

INT.   FRONT OF THE CAFETERIA--DAY

With even more speeded-up imagery, four STUDENTS wearing "What

a Waste, Oh the Humanity" T-shirts toss out tons of black

armbands into a hungry crowd.

INT.   FUNERAL HOME--DAY

The wild African music and the speeded up imagery slams to a

halt at the sigh of HEATHER DUKE lying serenely in a coffin.

FATHER FAUST wearing dark sunglasses and a terrifying toupee,

walks in front of her to address a sizable group of ADULTS and

STUDENTS sitting in foldout chairs before him. FATHER FAUST

dramatically looks over the crowd before finally speaking.

FATHER RIPPER lets the word hang in the air, then holds up

VERONICA stands in a corner with an "Oh brother" look on her face.

HEATHER

of steaming spaghetti. She is wearing nerdy glasses and

something that looks like an intergalactic prison unifrom.

With a squeal, HEATHER CHANDLER plunges VERONICA's face into

the plate of spaghetti.

INT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

Uncurling from the fetal position that she had fallen asleep

in, VERONICA's tightly closed eyes snap open in a sweat as her

mother's voice continues to filter through the door. It's all

been a dream...........

VERONICA closes her eyes and holds her heart. She suddenly

launches to her desk, opens her diary, shoves on her

monocle, catches her breath, and begins writing.

VERONICA leans back in her chair, sweating. She reaches in the

pocket of a blazer draped over the back of the chair and pulls

out the cigarette J.D. had given her eariler in the film. She

puts it in her mouth unlit then takes it out and puts it back

in the blazer.

EXT.   OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOME--NIGHT

J.D. remains laconically leaning against his motorcycle with

his legs suavely crossed as he was before Veronica began

dreaming. J.D. finishes his cigarette and pulls out a gun. He

checks the bullets, puts the gun back in his coat, and heads

toward the house.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

VERONICA hugs J.F.K. the cat then rips down the hanging Barbie.

EXT.   THE SAWYER FRONT YARD

J.D. leans a ladder against the Sawyer house.

INT.   THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE

MOM sets down three plates of spaghetti. DAD watches on.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

J.D. crawls through VERONICA's window. Hanging from the

rafter, neck in a noose of bedshoots, is VERONICA.

INT.   THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE

MOM sets a glass of milk at VERONICA's place, distressed.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM

J.D. paces the room, sweating and ranting, waving a gun in

one hand, the Barbie doll in the other.

J.D. throws the gun on the bed and pulls from his coat the

computer printout sheet petition, then savagely rolls it out

on the floor. It is filled with signatures of different

sizes, styles, and colors. J.F.K. blinks.

J.D. flicks open a switchblade. He runs the blade beneath

the typed paragraph at the top causing it to peel off,

reavealing another typed paragraph.

J.D. swiftly picks up the petition and heads out the window.

MOM enters the room and, seeing her hanging daughter,

launches into frantic screams.

VERONICA opens her eyes.

VERONICA undos the noose around her neck but still remains

hanging for the rope runs all the way down her back beneath

her blazer and is tied around her waist. She undos the waist-

knot and lands on her bed. She quickly puts a small pillow

over the left-behind gun, unnoticed by her dazed MOM.

THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE

Montage music plays as VERONICA rears up from her dinner

plate to see her stonefaced PARENTS and her CAT staring at her.

INT.   J.D.'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

J.D. tools with a bomb at his desk. A KNOCK on the door. J.D.

turns down his stereo (and the Montage music).

J.D. turns back up his stereo (and the Montage music).

EXT.   FRONT OF WESTERBERG HIGH--MORNING

The Montage music continues as school buses arrive in front

of the school. STUDENTS pour out.

EXT.   SCHOOL PARKING LOT--MORNING

STUDENTS come out of their cars.

INT.   HALLWAY--MORNING

Typically hectic start-of-another-day-opening-and-slamming-of-

locker-action. VERONICA darts through the thoroughfare to her locker.

A passing PAULINE FLEMING screeches to a halt, grabbing VERONICA

as she chokes on some styrofoam cup coffee.

VERONICA storms away to her nearby locker. She swirls her locker

combination and opens it. She glances down the hall and freezes.

In the distance, J.D. moves mechanically down the hallway

carrying a large gym bag, wearing a Walkman.

VERONICA climbs into her locker. She closes it until it is

barely perceptibly ajar. J.D. strides past the locker and into

the Boys bathroom.

BOYS BATHROOM

J.D smoothly moves into a stall and closes the door. He

turns off his Walkman and ends the Montage music.

THE HALLWAY

The hallway slowly clears as STUDENTS go to class. The bell

rings. A LATE STUDENT races through the empty hallway.

VERONICA carefully hatches out of her locker. She treads down

the hallway as if something were about to jump out at her.

THE GYM

A group of cheerleaders including HEATHER MCNAMARA are lazily

doing cartwheels on the gym floor. On a small stage set up

beside them, other STUDENTS are putting up folding chairs.

PRINCIPAL GOWAN says "Testing" into a microphone.

J.D., toting the gym bag, quietly opens the gym door and slips

inside. He swiftly moves unnoticed to a position underneath

the bleachers.

THE HALLWAY

VERONICA peers around a corner to see an empty hallway.

UNDER THE BLEACHERS

Using heavy black masking tape, J.D. tapes a thermal bomb to a

steel support beneath the bleachers. Other thermal bombs can

be discerned taped to other supports.

THE EMPTY HALLWAY

VERONICA cautiously treads down the empty hallway, trying to

keep in control. Suddenly, packs of STUDENTS burst from

classroom doors behind VERONICA. The excited swarms of

STUDENTS move toward and past VERONICA, who has braked her

troubled treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers.

She latches onto Geek RODNEY in a panic. RODNEY looks down at

his clutched arm with a nervous smile.

VERONICA ignores RODNEY's amiable attemots at conversation to

inquisitively move forward through the crowd.

THE GYM

J.D. darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors.

He pops the doors open and sees the crowd of STUDENTS move

toward the gym. He suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby

set of stairs.

THE HALLWAY LEADING TO THE GYM

VERONICA continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of STUDENTS

heading for the gymnasium. She stops to watch her classmates

file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of

dread. She again latches onto a passing RODNEY.

RODNEY (unconsciously) dramatically stops, turns to VERONICA.

and says........

VERONICA blanches then lunges through the crowd. She topples a

couple disgruntled STUDENTS before careening down the

staircase beside the gym.

HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE BOILER ROOM

J.D. walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room,

eyeing the pounding generators inside. He stops at a heavy

steel door. Placing down his gym bag, J.D. proceeds to swiftly

pick the lock. He swings open the steel door.

J.D. weilds around. A sweating VERONICA moves toward him,

pointing the bedroom gun at him.

J.D. looks down at the gym bag already on the ground. He

folds his arms and smiles. VERONICA forcefully moves closer.

J.D. suddenly kicks out into VERONICA's stomach, doubling her

over and causing her to drop the gun. J.D. gracefully

retrieves it.

THE GYM

The pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy STUDENTS in the

bleachers earthily shouting, giggling cheerleaders making

swaying pyramids, valiant band members struggling to be heard.

Various Jocks, including EARL, stand on the stage with

PRINCIPAL GOWAN as a YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPHER flashes away.

THE HALLWAY BEFORE THE BOILER ROOM

VERONICA bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs.

J.D. raises the gun to her head.

VERONICA swings her left arm up knocking J.D.'s gun hand

upward. She then sails her right fist into his face. The blow

annoys him more than it hurts him but J.D.'s momentary loss of

composure allows VERONICA to come in with another much harder

right hook. The blow sends J.D. stumbling back against the

boiler room, jarring the gun loose.

They simultaneously lunge for the gun. VERONICA, having the

better grip, pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun

from J.D., she loses control of it, flinging it down the hall.

VERONICA pops up to retrieve it but J.D. moves his legs

scissors-style around her and trips her.

THE PREP ASSEMBLY

The assembly mindlessly blares on. Cheerleader HEATHER

MCNAMARA rah-rah-rahs. RODNEY and the other Geeks pass around

a pair of opera glasses, all intensely scoping out the

cheerleaders. A group of STONERS toke away beneath the

bleachers, one of them lackadaisically leaning against a

thermal bomb.

THE BOILER ROOM HALLWAY

A snarling J.D. stands up, pulling VERONICA with him.

J.D. violently kisses/bites VERONICA. While kissing, VERONICA

sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall. She closes her eyes then

savagely knees J.D. in the groin. VERONICA bolts to the alarm

and pulls it down. Nothing happens. J.D. gasps.

VERONICA rockets her body down and picks up the gun. J.D.

grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door.

A jostled VERONICA raises the gun. J.D. howls then bounds

toward VERONICA, causing them both to careen down the steel

steps of the boiler room. At the same time, he inadvertently

kicks the gym bag/bomb down along with them. The gun spins

from VERONICA's hand and slides away. The bomb flies out of

the bag onto the boiler room floor. A digital clock on

the bomb clicks on at 5:00....4:59....4:58...

THE PEP ASSEMBLY

The frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing "The Wave". BETTY

FINN and her similar co-horts deliriously get into the act,

all sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers,

pouting as STUDENTS bounce up and down around them. EARL and

the other Jocks stand on the stage grinning and preening

before the crowd.

THE BOILER ROOM

VERONICA and J.D. are in a heap at the bottom of the boiler

room steps. VERONICA faintly works into a semi-sitting

position and gives an astonished glance to the bomb, its

digital clock clicking to 3:00. VERONICA crawls to the gun and

levels it at a rousing-up J.D.

Fully standing, J.D. flicks open his switchblade. He gives

VERONICA "the finger," screaming in exploded saliva...

Seething, VERONICA shoots up at J.D. blowing off "the finger."

Shrieking in pain, J.D. drops the knife to hold this sudden

geyser of blood. VERONICA achingly stands, pointing the gun.

The bomb clicks down to 2:25.

VERONICA fires the gun at J.D.'s feet. The bomb clicks to 1:49.

VERONICA fires the gun twice into J.D.'s throat. Coughing and

moaning, he splatters against a generator.

VERONICA saunters to J.D.'s writhing body.

J.D. closes his eyes and slumps to the ground. VERONICA turns

to the bomb and crouches over it. A lit green light is next to

a green button. Above it, an unlit red light is next to a red

button. The bomb's digital clock clicks to 00:17. VERONICA

presses the red button twice, turning on the red light and

stopping the clock. VERONICA falls back into a sitting

position and sorely exhales, tears streaming down her face.

THE PEP ASSEMBLY

A cheerleader does a cartwheel in slow motion as eerie music

plays. The manic crowd in the bleachers vibrates in slow

motion as well.

At normal speed, VERONICA walks to the doors of the Gym and

peers in. The panorama of roaring students, posing jocks, and

prancing cheerleaders continues to unfold in slow motion.

VERONICA walks away from the gym.

EXT.   THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL   DAY

VERONICA wearily pushes open the front door and emerges

outside of the school. She closes her eyes to therapeutically

bask in the sun's rays. A slight smile trembles onto her face.

A strange voice kills it.

J.D. stands starkly in the distance before her, blood spurting

from his throat onto his gunslinger coat. He painfully speaks

through his assasinated vocal cords.

J.D. pulls open his coat revealing that the bomb is attached to

his torso. The green light is on and the clock says 00:10..00:09.

VERONICA takes the unlit cigrette from her blazer pocket and

puts it in her mouth. She then folsd her arms.

J.D. raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks

to 0:00. Nothing happens. An annoyed J.D. breaks out of his

crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm.

THE PEP ASSEMBLY

The sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up-and-

down pep assembly into chaos. Wailing students pour out of the

bleachers screaming less out of fear than a "Whoa Dude" sense

of excitement.

THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL

VERONICA stands in the same position in front of the school

with her arms still folded. Only now her cigarette is lit and

her face and clothes are blackened in ash. Flames flicker in

bushes behind her. VERONICA drags on the cigarette and turns

to go inside.

INT.   THE FRONT HALLWAY

VERONICA strolls into the school and into a hallway of howling

students, some of whom are tearing down Prom banners for the

thrill of it. HEATHER DUKE rushes up to VERONICA and grimaces.

VERONICA tosses away the cigarette. She then grabs HEATHER

DUKE by the shoulders and forcibly turns her around.

VERONICA takes off HEATHER DUKE's red ribbon and ties it

around the hair of her own head. She kisses HEATHER DUKE on

the cheek, leaving a black stain. VERONICA calls off.

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK revealed to be in an electric

wheelchair, brakes to a stop and looks to Veronica, confused.

VERONICA walks up beside her. MARTHA starts up her wheelchair

and accompanies VERONICA away into a deserted hallway.

VERONICA and MARTHA continue gliding down the hall

Bogart/Rains style.
