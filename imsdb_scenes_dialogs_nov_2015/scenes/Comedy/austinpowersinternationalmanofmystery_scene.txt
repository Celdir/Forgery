ICE, all in suspended animation.  They pass a now-empty berth

with a plate that reads "JOHN

TRAVOLTA."

Finally, they come across Austin Powers: He is naked.  His

hands cover up his private parts.  The look on his face

suggests 'Oh my God, my bits and pieces are cold'.  His

glasses are frosted over.  He is very hairy.

Lasers begin to cut Austin out of the ice in one huge cube.

A ROBOTIC ARM lifts the cube out of the berth and places it

into a high-tech melting vat of warm liquid GOO.

Austin comes to life out of the goo on a draining platform.

HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!

There is an uncomfortable pause, because clearly we should

have FADED TO BLACK.  The evil associates look around the

room, not knowing what to do with themselves.

They exit the frame awkwardly.

INT.  BRITISH MAKESHIFT HQ

Austin and Vanessa enter past two BRITISH MILITARY POLICEMAN.

There is a communications center, a makeshift armory, bunks,

Austin hauls off and PUNCHES the lady in the face.

Austin begins tugging on her hair.

The two guards come over and help Mrs. Exposition to a cot.

Basil escorts his mother out.

weird, irrational, unfocused...well, jealousy.  I'm sorry.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

MUSIC:  "What the World Needs Now" by BURT BACHARACH Austin

looks at his address book.  ANGLE ON THE PAGE:  We see a

comments written in beside them.  Beside Jimi Hendrix we see

"Deceased, Drugs"; Janis Joplin, "Deceased, Alcohol"; Mama

Cass, "Deceased, Ham Sandwich"; Jerry Garcia. "Deceased,

Gratefully"; Jane Fonda, "Square".

Austin looks at his old pair of Sixties-era canvas sneakers.

He picks up his new pair&emdash; REEBOK SHAQ CROSS-TRAINER

PUMPS.  He pumps them too much and they explode.

Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below.  We

see the CDs he's just purchased, including SERGEANT PEPPER'S

and BURT BACHARACH'S GREATEST HITS.

Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened

Campbell's Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on.  It

explodes in a shower of sparks and soup.

He puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle.  The

NOISE is awful.

Austin plays MORTAL COMBAT III.  His fighter gets his head

ripped off, and blood spews out.

Austin is genuinely frightened by this.

INT.  BATHROOM

Austin attempts to use the Water Pik, but the head is too

is pleased.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Austin sits watching the TIME-LIFE The Last Thirty Years

video on TV.  Vanessa enters.

INT.  THERAPIST'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

We're in the middle of a group therapy session, containing

six or seven FATHERS with their teenage SONS.  It is

emotionally charged.  A lot of pained expressions and coffee

in Styrofoam cups.

They hug.  Everyone APPLAUDS.  We see Dr. Evil and Scott.

The group LAUGHS.

Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring we'd make

meat helmets.  If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap

bag and beaten with reeds.  Pretty standard, really.  At the

age of twelve I received my first scribe.  At the

age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically

shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shawn

scrotum.  At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical

school.  From there...

ANGLE ON THE THERAPIST AND THE GROUP.  They are stunned.

ride on an electric tram.

The people on the tour APPLAUD.

INT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA

All the tourists head for the gift shop.  Austin notices a

SEVEN-FOOT-TALL SCIENTIST leaving the "RESTRICTED AREA" with

a FOUR-HUNDRED-POUND FEMALE SCIENTIST.  They both wear

Virtucon coveralls.

The seven-foot-tall male scientist goes to the men's room;

the four-hundred-pound woman goes to the ladies room.  Austin

and Vanessa follow.

We hear from inside either washroom the sound of PEOPLE BEING

KNOCKED OUT.

Austin and Vanessa exit wearing the scientists' coveralls

over their clothes.  Magically, the coveralls fit perfectly.

They go through the doors into the restricted area.

INT.  HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA

They approach the security GUARD.

Just watch me.  Watch me, now.

They reach the guard.

They flash their security badges to the guard.

ANGLE ON AUSTIN.  WE PUSH IN SLOWLY AS AUSTIN CONCENTRATES,

Austin does his mind-control again.

She pulls him away.

Austin and Vanessa come to a door marked "PROJECT VULCAN -

All the radiation suited scientists turn to look at Austin

and Vanessa.

The scientist approach.  Austin knocks two of them out cold

Vanessa knocks two of them out using roundhouse kicks.

SECURITY GUARDS flood into the room from the hallway.  Austin

and Vanessa take off through another side door which reads

"VIRTUCON

STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY."

INT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY

It is a room the size of a large gymnasium overseen by a

large observation booth.  Six STEAMROLLER go around a test

track very slowly.

Austin and Vanessa hide behind one of the slowly moving

steamrollers.  Security guards enter the facility and begin

fanning out in a search.

They climb up the back of a steamroller, KNOCK OUT the DRIVER,

push him off, and assume the controls.

Two SECURITY GUYS jump on either side of the steamroller.

Vanessa wrestles the machine gun off on and pushes him away.

Austin punches the other one off.

He engages a lever.  It goes only slightly faster.

TWO SECURITY GUARDS jump in front of the steamroller.  They

are acting like they're frozen, ad if in the headlights of a

fast-approaching car.

ANGLE ON THE GUARDS.  ONE OF THE GUYS JUMPS OUT OF THE WAY

AS IF "IN THE NICK OF TIME."  THE

steamroller is now 8 yards away.  The other army guy is still

frozen in the path of the oncoming steamroller.

ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE'S BATHED IN THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE

STEAMROLLER, WHICH IS STILL 3 YARDS

away.

ANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA.  AUSTIN IS FRANTICALLY JERKING

THE STEERING WHEEL AND TRYING TO

downshift.  SFX:  Metal grinds.  The shifter breaks off along

with a gaggle of wares.  He desperately jams on the breaks.

ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE IS FINALLY RUN OVER BY THE

STEAMROLLER.  THERE IS AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF

blood and guts.

By now, Austin and Vanessa are right by the door.  They run

out into the hallway.

INT.  HALLWAY

The coast is clear.

From behind, a HAND knocks Vanessa and Austin out.  It is

Random Task flanked by four SECURITY

GUARDS.

INT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY

We see the aftermath.  Several WORKMEN sweep up the blood

and guts with large squeegees and brooms.  One of them turns

to reveal "Steamroller Accident Response Team" written on

his jumpsuit.

Another WORKMAN leans down to the body with a hand broom and

dust pail to sweep up blood.  ZOOM IN on the steamrolled

Army guy's ID tag, which reads "STEVE HARWIN."

VIRTUCON ARMY MEMBERS keep watch.  SCIENTISTS check

The electric minivan pulls up right next to the immense table.

All the evil associates are present.  Dr. Evil squeezes a

tennis ball repeatedly.  Frau Farbissina opens the rear hatch

of the minivan and pulls out Austin and Vanessa.

Look at it, it's been rendered useless.

He moves his arm around to show them, but it's virtually

normal, just slightly aged.

A large telescreen comes on, showing the United Nations Secret

Meeting Room.

He presses a button on his chair panel.  A giant canvas falls,

unveiling an ultra-high tech diamond-bladed subterranean

Scott enters.

ANGLE ON A PANEL OF BUTTONS THAT HAS EVERYONE'S NAMES ON IT.

DR. EVIL'S HAND HOVERS OVER THE

button labeled "SCOTT."  Frau Farbissina slaps his hand away.

A PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIER grabs Austin and Vanessa.  Dr. Evil

hits a button.  One whole wall slides out to reveal a tank.

They're quite delighted you'll be part of the meal.

The soldier takes Austin and Vanessa to the tank and puts

them in the dipping mechanism.

The guard do so.  Austin and Vanessa begin to descend slowly

towards the surface of the water.

Frau clears her throat again.

What do we have?

Frau Farbissina throws a leg of lamb attached to a rope

towards the tank, where the WATER BUBBLES and sea bass arch

through the air.  The sea bass devour the lamb.  She pulls

the rope back.  The lamb has been eaten to the bare bone.

Dr. Evil presses a button; the wall closes back over the

tank.

INT.  TANK AREA

Austin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water.  They

can see the WATER BUBBLING beneath them.

Just then, a SEA BASS jumps out of the water, just missing

Austin.

She pulls out a container of dental floss.

Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental

floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo.

He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches

like a grappling hook.

Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack.

Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the

sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the

floss.  He keeps pulling out floss.

More floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.  Finally,

the floss line goes TAUT.  Austin ties it off high on the

pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.  Austin holds out his

hand like a surgeon&emdash;

Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile

the guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the

open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES

at the guard loudly.  He turns around.

Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of

toothpaste into the guard's eyes.

Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing

both ends.

She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety

right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water.

Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared

all over his face.

He and Austin STRUGGLE.

The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's

head dangling over the water.  SEA

BASS circle.  The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's

head.

Austin FLIPS the guard over.  The SEA BASS chew the guard's

head off like a blender.

They head out a door.  ANGLE ON THE HEADLESS TORSO.  The

name tag reads "JOHN SMITH."

LEGS drop and wrap around Austin's neck and lift him up.

His feet leave the floor.

Another FEMBOT cartwheels up to Austin.  Nozzles pop out of

the tips of the Fembot's bra.

A cloud of multicolored gas spews from the nozzles.  Austin

is overcome.  The room starts to spin.

INT.  DR. EVIL'S MAIN CHAMBER - CONTROL AREA

Dr. Evil sits into his chair with his radiation suit on.

INT.  FEMBOT LAIR

Two Fembots guard the door and five are on the bed in come-

hither poses.

MUSIC:  Sexy Matt Helm-type theme Austin starts his seductive

dance.  He does a quick head count of the Fembots, reaches

out of frame, pulls out eight cigarettes, put them in his

mouth and lights them with a blowtorch.

He throws seven cigarettes one by one.  Each cigarette lands

perfectly in a different Fembot's mouth.  Austin smokes the

remaining cigarette.

Austin begins to do a seductive striptease.  The Fembots are

aroused.  He takes off his shirt, revealing his hairy chest,

and focuses his sexual energy on one Fembot.

She begins to shake violently, her head shaking back and

forth like in Jacob's Ladder.

Eventually her head explodes.  Austin is now stripped down

to his Union Jack bikini briefs and

turns to another Fembot.  Her head explodes.

He takes off his shoes and throws them away cavalierly.

Then he tosses down his lit cigarette and grinds it with his

bare foot.  He gives a look of disguised pain.

He mouths "I love you" to another Fembot.  Her head explodes.

He does the 'I'll call you' hand signal to yet another Fembot,

whose head explodes.

Austin does a hip-thrust to another and her head explodes.

Austin leans over and wags his rump to the two remaining

Fembots.

Their heads explode simultaneously.  All the Fembots are

lying on the floor, smoking.  Just then, Vanessa enters,

flanked by a COUPLE OF COMMANDOS.  She surveys the scene and

looks at Austin in his briefs.  She's hurt.  The commandos

salute Austin.

INT.  MAIN CHAMBER

Austin and Vanessa lead FIFTEEN COMMANDOS into the chamber

Austin heads for the door until he smacks into AN INVISIBLE

FORCE FIELD.  He turns and sees a bank of old-fashioned

computers labeled "DESTRUCTACON 5000".

The computers begin to smoke.  Alarm bells ring.

There is a muffled explosion.  The computer goes dark.  Austin

passes through the force field and heads for the door until

he hears&emdash;

He begins looking furiously for the abort button.

The Eastern European Man holds up his finger as if to say

'give me one second.'

Austin sees the abort button.  It is across the room.  Just

him, but he has run out of bullets.  Random task takes off

his SHOE.

Austin makes his way across the room to the button.

Random Task THROWS HIS SHOE.

Random task blocks Austin's way to the button.  He stands

there, menacing, missing one shoe.

Exposed wires are everywhere.  On the counter beside Austin

is a Big Gulp.

Austin throws the drink at Random Task's feet.  It lands in

front of him on a pile of exposed wires.  Electricity travels

Austin grabs Scott and puts the gun to his head.

Scott runs off.  In the confusion, Vanessa KNOCKS the gun

out of Alotta's hands.  Alotta pulls out a knife.  Austin

SHOOTS the knife out of her hand.  Vanessa grabs Alotta by

the throat.

Vanessa gives her a judo chop.

Meanwhile, Dr. Evil has run to the egg shaped rocket, which
