NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS

AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR

THIS SOFT COPY.

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

PAN across details in a bedroom...we see discarded

shirts...pants...socks...and hear

Now we see a TV...but the picture isn't clear.  Or, more

appropriately, the picture is scrambled -- it phases in

and out.  Bars scroll across it.  And we get occasional

glimpses of what looks like --

As most high-school guys know (but few will admit), it is

possible to watch the pay channels while they're

scrambled.  You just need a decent imagination to fill in

the rest of the picture.  We PULL BACK to see JIM -- 17,

short, horny.

Jim is, uh, physically involved with the scrambled babe.

We TILT DOWN to see a small multimedia presentation next

to Jim on his bed.  "Cosmopolitan" is open to a sexy

model...a yearbook is open to the "girl's swim team"

section...and a dictionary next to Jim, open to the

"Vagina" listing, accompanied by a big vagina diagram.

He frantically looks around...and grabs a tube sock off

the floor.

Jim is thrown off.

Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the door, immediately after

which JIM'S MOM enters.  Jim scrambles and quickly covers

himself and the dictionary with a pillow.  She's

oblivious to his doings.

Jim is revolted.  Very reluctantly he gives her a kiss.

She turns to leave, and notices the TV.

He hurriedly tries to change the channel with the REMOTE,

but instead the VOLUME GOES UP.

Jim panics as his mom reacts, shocked.

JIM'S DAD enters.

Jim's Dad grabs for the remote, which is sitting on the

pillow that's been covering Jim.  The pillow gets brushed

aside -- revealing the Big Vagina Diagram, Jim with his

shorts down, and a very strategically placed tube sock.

He ushers her out.  Jim's Dad is stuck there with his

half-naked son.  Horrible, awful embarrassment.  A long,

strained beat.

Jim's Dad exits, shaking his head.  Jim sits agape,

humiliated.

EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS - DAY

We see a Honda Accord drive by a sign at the city limits:

"Welcome to East Great Falls, Michigan -- A Great Place

To Be"

EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL - DAY

The front of the school.  KEVIN drives up in his Accord.

He's a good-humored, good-enough-looking high school

senior.  VICKY rides shotgun -- pretty, smart, confident.

She's holding a large, thick envelope, with a big

"Vanderbilt" return address on it.

She tears it open.  Pulls out a course catalog, various

forms, and a letter which she hands to Kevin.

Vicky SCREAMS in excitement, like a girl at a Beatles

concert.  Then she LAUGHS, and gives Kevin a big kiss and

hug.

She hugs Kevin tighter -- as he looks a little frazzled,

almost perfunctorily returning the hug.

EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - MORNING

Jim has met up with CHRIS OSTREICHER -- "OZ" -- a cocky

senior with a football-player build.  He cradles a ball

in a lacrosse stick.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALLWAY - DAY

Jim and Oz, now joined by Kevin, walk down the hall.  Oz

bounces the lacrosse ball off a locker, catching it

again.  Kevin speaks a little distantly, unnerved.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY

The guys pass by a GROUP OF BAND DORKS, most notable of

which is MICHELLE, who proudly polishes her flute.

The Band Dorks LAUGH and agree, "hilariously" attempting

to play their instruments from the wrong end.  The guys

shudder.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL NEAR POP MACHINE - DAY

Vicky is talking with JESSICA, a friend of hers, getting

a pop (we're in the Midwest now, gang) from the machine.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY

Kevin, Jim, and Oz are still walking down the hall.

PAUL FINCH, preppy, eccentric, is sitting on a bench.

The guys keep staring.  A beat.

Someone is HOLLERING down the hall.  Running towards Oz

is STEVE STIFLER -- very clean-cut and preppy, he's a

maniac, a jackass, much worse than Oz.  Not really part

of the group.

Stifler runs full-force into Oz, grabbing him in a bear

hug.

Oz gives a little nod, avoiding the issue.

Oz musters a little LAUGH.

The guys all take this little too seriously to have a

comeback.  Stifler just LAUGHS OBNOXIOUSLY as he walks

off.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Kevin is on the phone.  Hanging near his closet is a

tuxedo.  INTERCUT with KEVIN'S OLDER BROTHER -- 25, on

his cell phone, traveling down a California road.

INT. DOG DAYS - LATE AFTERNOON

A small, nostalgia-themed dive.  Despite the theme,

CLASSIC ROCK plays.  Kevin, Oz, Jim and Finch sit at a

table.  They munch on hot dogs piled high with

condiments.

Jim is paging through Great Falls' equivalent of the LA

Weekly.

Finch displays the cross-section on his hot dog.  It's

all condiments.  The guys react with rehearsed offense.

He hands out a stick of gum to each guy, automatically

skipping Finch, who pulls out a small, hotel-bottle of

Scope.  Gargles with it.  Spits it into his drink cup.

Oz has tuned into the song in the background -- "Blinded

by the Light" [the original Springsteen version, not the

Manfred Mann remake].

EXT. DOG DAYS - MAGIC HOUR - CONTINUING

They exit the restaurant.

They ponder this for a moment.

Jim shrugs, embarrassed.

They just look at him.  Finch hops on his scooter.

He MEEPS his horn and buzzes away.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

For a high-school party, it's pretty good.  The house is

peppered with ALL TYPES OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS.  MUSIC

blends with the din of excited conversation.

Kevin and Jim are drinking beers.  Around them, students

mingle and flirt.  CHUCK SHERMAN comes up.

Sherman saunters off into the party.

Vicky approaches, having a good time, joining the guys,

EXCHANGING GREETINGS.  Jim spots NADIA across the room.

She's beautiful, a masterpiece of a woman.

Kevin and Vicky disappear into the crowd -- just as Jim

sees Nadia approaching him.  He freaks.

But he's gone.  And Nadia is now in front of him.  With

no other alternative, Jim readies himself, smiling big.

Jim smiles.

Jim's smile grows even bigger, almost stupid.  A beat.

Jim nods, still smiling away.  Staring right through her

head.

A little SQUEAK escapes his throat.  Jim is on mental

vacation.

A beat.  Jim's expression is now plasticized.  Eyes

vacant.  A frozen, completely artificial smile. Nadia is

confused.

Jim strains to speak, through his smile.

She walks off.  Jim SIGHS, completely relaxing, like a

huge burden is now off of him.  He wipes his brow.  Then,

realizing --

He pounds his head with his fist.

EXT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

A group of band dorks is on the porch, including

Michelle.  Stifler stands in the doorway, staring at them

in disbelief.

MUSIC blares from inside.  A drunken HAND reaches through

the door and ruffles Stifler's hair.

The hand disappears back into the house.  A beat.

Stifler slams the door.  The dorks wait a moment.

We hear a CLICK OF A DEADBOLT.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kevin and Vicky are on the bed, making out.

Kevin and Vicky exchange a glance.

Vicky pushes him onto his back.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Oz is in the passenger seat, making out with the

aforementioned COLLEGE CHICK.  She's attractive and older-

looking (from a high-school perspective).  They are

parked near the river that flows through downtown Great

Falls.

At this, she snuggles up to him.  Oz smiles confidently.

The College Chick backs off, confounded.

The College Chick's eyes flutter in disbelief.  She tries

to keep her cool -- but can barely restrain her laughter.

Oz attempts to maintain a suave exterior, but he's just

had the rug pulled from under him.

She bursts into laughter.  Oz is ill.

Seeing Oz's defeated expression, she collects herself.

She sees that he's lost.  Almost feels sorry for him.

She's trying not to laugh again.

Oz couldn't be humiliated any further.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - SAME TIME

Oz is nursing a beer, having just told the story to Jim,

Stifler, and some guys.

Stifler strides into another room.

Oz wallows in his beer can, beaten.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Vicky is pleasuring Kevin...you know.

She resumes.  A moment more -- and then Kevin is about to

lose it.

With awkward hurriedness, Vicky stops as Kevin

frantically searches for a receptacle.  He grabs a nearby

cup of beer.

EXT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH, BY THE KEG - NIGHT

Insert -- A hand pumping up the keg.  A fresh beer foams

out into the cup.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Vicky is buttoning up her shirt.  Kevin tentatively sets

down the beer and buttons his pants.  Suddenly the DOOR

BURSTS OPEN.  Stifler is standing there.  A coat hanger

sticks out of the doorknob.

She runs out, grabbing her clothes.  Kevin runs after

her.

Stifler enters the bedroom, laughing, pulling a SOPHOMORE

CHICK behind him.  He closes the door.

Stifler notices Kevin's beer sitting on the night table.

He hands it to her.

She's about to take a sip.

Thrown off, she sets the beer down.

She's totally enthralled.  Nervous, she raises the beer

again to take a sip.  Then Stifler moves in.  Takes the

beer from her and sets it down.  Starts kissing her.  She

breaks it off.

Stifler looks inconvenienced.  He picks up the beer,

annoyed.

Avoiding her look, he raises the beer to take a sip.

Stifler stops and SIGHS, the beer inches from his mouth.

Lowers it.  Stares her in the eye.

Smiling, he raises the beer...

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUING

Jim and some OTHER GUYS are pounding shots of vodka.

A GUY SCREAMS upstairs.

A GIRL SCREAMS upstairs.  The SOPHOMORE CHICK comes

running through the kitchen.  SCREAMING.  And

indeterminate stain is on her shirt.  She bolts out the

door and into the night.  A moment passes.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Stifler is on his knees, barfing in the toilet.  Jim and

a few other guys rush in.

Stifler just keeps hurling.  Kevin enters, holding the

remains of the tainted beer.

Stifler barfs even more violently.

EXT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH, BY THE KEG - NIGHT

Jessica and Vicky are refilling their beers at the keg.

Nadia waits patiently beside them with an empty cup.

Vicky shrugs.

Nadia walks off.

Vicky nods, traumatized.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER

Kevin and Jim are looking at a PICTURE OF STIFLER'S MOM

on the wall.  Very attractive, late 30's.

TWO FRESHMAN GUYS are walking by as Jim says this.

Suddenly, a bedroom door opens a couple inches.  Sherman

pokes his head out.

In the bedroom in the background, we see the Central

Girl.  Sherman closes the door, leaving the guys there,

dumbstruck.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Jim and Kevin are coming down the stairs.

They turn the corner into the kitchen.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUING

He stops.  Vicky is there with Jessica.  Staring at him.

Vicky quietly grabs her purse.  Hurt.  OTHER STUDENTS

watch, silently.  Kevin doesn't know what to say.

The guys watch as the girls head for the door.

The girls exit.  Nobody says anything.  Kevin is in

shock.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - DAY

The next morning.  The party is long over.  Plastic beer

cups and various bottles litter the house, but it's not

trashed.

Jim is wandering around in a daze, holding his head.  He

stumbles over a body.  It's Kevin.

They walk over to the other side of the room.  Finch is

sitting on the couch.

Oz wanders in, still sullen.  Takes a seat, sulking.

We hear FOOTSTEPS coming down the stairs.  It's the

CENTRAL GIRL.  She wears a "Central" sweatshirt.  Sherman

follows behind her.  The guys watch in disbelief as

Sherman and the girl speak hushed, intimately.

The Central Girl smiles.  Notices the other guys

watching.  Just gives Sherman a kiss on the cheek.

She exits.  The guys are dumbfounded.  Jaws hang.

Sherman looks triumphant.  Strides over to the guys.

The guys are shocked and amazed.

Sherman exits.  Silence.  The guys look like they just

lost the World Series on errors.  They slowly take seats,

ruined.

A long beat as they give this serious consideration.

Then, Kevin strides purposefully to the front of the

group.

They do.

A beat

Oz nods, getting into it.  Kevin smiles and continues,

arms outspread.

Kevin jumps up on a chair.

Kevin jumps down off the chair, and puts his hand out in

front of him.  One by one, the guys pile their hands on

top, in between them -- it's a pact!  They break with a

CHEER.  Woo-hoo!

They all stop.  Stifler has a toothbrush hanging from his

mouth.  A goatee of dried toothpaste.

Stifler tries to give a retort to Finch, but turns green

and heads back upstairs.

INT. DOG DAYS - DAY

The guys are finishing up breakfast.  Hot dogs & eggs.

Finch gives a wistful "Who, me?"

They take this in with some trepidation.

There are none.  Kevin raises his Pepsi.

The guys raise their drinks.

They toast.  And from this, we go into our STRATEGIZING

FOR SEX MONTAGE:

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jim sits in the room as Kevin goes through the yellow

pages.  Finds a "Floral Delivery" listing.  Kevin dials.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY

Kevin, Jim, and Oz are pooling a few dollars together,

which Kevin takes.  They part ways.

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Oz is watching the Lifetime Channel as Jim looks on in

confusion.  A Martha Stewart-type thing where they pain

pottery with little sponges.  Oz looks dubious.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY

Finch is unpacking his lunch.  He carefully unfolds a

napkin to reveal a sandwich, crust removed.  Other than

that, he's doing absolutely nothing.

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jim is fiddling with a small, golfball-like camera

attached to his computer.  The computer screen reads, "E-

DATE:  We Make Love Happen."  As Jim fiddles with the

camera, a window on the screen shows his real-time image.

He clicks an onscreen-button labeled "FREEZE IMAGE" --

the image freezes, showing Jim with an awkward grimace.

The screen reads, "IMAGE SENT."

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGHS - LIBRARY - DAY

Kevin holds a copy of the HOLY BIBLE.  We see he's in the

"Religion" section.  Surrounded by piles of different

bibles.  No luck.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY

Finch pulls out a small mustard packet.  He neatly snips

the end with scissors.  Then rolls the packet, like a

tube of toothpaste, economically dispensing every last

bit of mustard.

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jim is on his computer.  The screen reads "YOU HAVE 00

REPLIES."  Jim is nonplussed.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY

Kevin, Oz, and Jim are closely gathered around Kevin's

locker, holding their backpacks open.  Kevin holds a big

shopping bag, which he turns over, and a box of condoms

falls out.  He hands it over to Jim...and we see that the

guys' packs are full of various condom boxes.

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jim has unraveled a bunch of condoms and is curiously

examining them.

And THE MONTAGE COMES TO AN ABRUPT END with a KNOCKING.

He opens the bedroom door.  Jim's Dad is standing there.

Jim's Dad reluctantly enters, carrying a brown paper bag.

He takes a seat on Jim's bed.

Jim takes a seat next to his dad.

Jim looks at the bag.  Uncomfortable.  Hesitantly, he

takes it.  Slowly, dreadfully, he pulls out a copy of

PERFECT 10.

Jim's Dad is doing his best to be the good father.

Beyond embarrassed, Jim reaches into the bag.  Cringes.

Pulls out a PENTHOUSE.

Jim's Dad takes the bag back.  Pulls out a copy of

SHAVED.

Jim MURMURS something incomprehensible.

Jim's Dad takes the stack of magazines.  He goes to open

Jim's night table.  Jim freaks.

But it's too late.  Jim's Dad is face-to-face with the

unraveled prophylactics.  He sours.

Jim's Dad exits, a condom stuck to the back of his pants.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NEAR THE HALL OF FAME - DAY

Kevin is trying to talk to Vicky.

She doesn't care.

Vicky stares him right in the eye.  Strong.

She slams her locker and walks off.  Jessica is nearby.

She's overheard.

Kevin squirms.

Suddenly Stifler comes running up, breathless.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - MOMENT LATER

The VOCAL JAZZ GROUP is practicing, singing one of those

doo-wop, Acapella love songs (i.e. "Love You Like I Do").

Singing with the group is none other than Oz.  He's not

doing too badly, but mainly he's checking out the various

vocal jazz girls.  Smiling at them, giving suave little

waves.

Kevin, Stifler, and Jim take seats in the back of the

auditorium, listening.

The song finishes.  Oz bounds up to the other guys.

ANGLE ON SOME VOCAL JAZZ GIRLS

A few of the girls are gathering their stuff, one of whom

is HEATHER -- conservative-looking, cute.

Heather shakes her head.  BACK TO:

Oz waves goodbye to a final choir girl.

EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - LATER

Finch is sitting on a bench, reading the paper, carefree.

Kevin and Jim approach.

He turns a page.  Skims the articles.  A beat.

Finch shudders and walks away.  Kevin and Jim stand

there, dumbfounded.  An ENTHRALLED GIRL approaches.

She hurries off to a GROUP OF GIRLS, sharing the gossip.

They all seem very interested.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Kevin is on the phone.

INTERCUT WITH

INT. SUSHI BAR - DAY

Kevin's brother is on his cell phone.  A SUSHI CHEF

prepares food behind the counter.

The Sushi Chef looks up.  Kevin's Brother turns away.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BACK OF LIBRARY - DAY

Kevin is walking through the "Religion" Section.  He

carefully looks about, making sure nobody's watching.

Kevin kneels down on the floor, near a section of various

bibles on the bottom shelf.

Kevin slides out the section of bibles from the bottom

shelf.  Pulls out a pocket knife.  Flips up the bottom of

the shelf.  Slides it out.

There, a bit dusty, is an old book.  Many extra pages of

notebook paper have been tucked into it, nearly breaking

the binding.  The original title is now obscured -- over

it, someone has written "The Bible."

Remember when Indian Jones found that gold statue?  It's

like that right now.

Kevin carefully pulls it out.  Reverently flips through

it.  Full of details.  Explicit diagrams.  Anecdotes.

And atop each handwritten page is a year, indicating the

date it was added.

Kevin reaches the last page.  It's blank.  He lightly

runs his hand down the empty page.

INT. JIM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Jim enters his house, slinging his backpack off his

shoulder.

No response.  Jim walks into the kitchen, noticing a

fresh-baked pie on the counter.  Next to it is a note:

"Jimmy - Apple, your favorite.  I'll be home late.

Enjoy!  Love Mom."

Jim sniffs the pie, taking in the aroma.  Then stops...as

a quizzical look spreads across his face.

After a moment of thought, he slides a finger into the

pie.  Moves it around a bit, studying the consistency.

Then Jim becomes more curious.  We can see the gears in

his head start to turn.  He looks down at the pie like

it's... well, not a pie.

EXT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY

Jim's dad gets out of his car, carrying his briefcase.

INT. JIM'S HOUSE - CONTINUING

Jim's dad comes in the door and stops dead in his tracks.

His face drops, appalled.

INT. JIM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Jim and his Dad sit in silence, opposite each other at

the table.  Jim stares into his lap, humiliated.  Jim's

dad is crushed.  You've never seen such disappointment...

but he's trying to keep his chin up for Jim's sake.

In the middle of the table is the pie.  It's decimated.

Mushed up, ruined...violated.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Late.  Kevin sits on his bed, reading a book -- the

Bible.

If all students studied the way Kevin's studying this

book, we'd have a nation of geniuses.  He's scrutinizing

it.  Turning it sideways and upside down as if trying to

decipher cave paintings.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - DAY

The Vocal Jazz Group is doing a song.  Oz is singing

along, really making it look like he's into it.  He

closes his eyes, singing with even more enthusiasm.  As

the song ends, Oz continues just a moment more with his

shtick -- a little, heartfelt vocal "scat" to tag the

number.  The thing is, it actually sounds really good.

Oz opens his eyes...to see the whole group -- especially

the girls -- looking at him, somewhat awed.

The CHOIR TEACHER is a smartly-dressed black woman.

Rehearsal wraps up, and Heather comes up to Oz.

Oz "gets serious" at this.

Of course, this is what Stifler said about her.  And for

a moment, this catches Oz off guard.

EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - DAY

Kevin is walking home with Vicky.  He's a couple paces

behind her, almost tagging along.

She cracks a little smile.

Vicky stops walking.  Looks at Kevin.

EXT. VICKY'S HOUSE - DAY

Vicky's perfect suburban home...as we hear VICKY MOANING

IN ECSTASY.

INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Tight on Vicky's face, in sexual bliss, writhing.

We see that Kevin is kneeling on the floor.  Vicky's legs

are to both sides of him -- he's ducking down, consulting

the bible, which is hidden beneath the bed.  It's open to

a page titled "The Tongue Tornado."

Kevin resumes, out of frame.  Vicky goes nuts.

Vicky reaches blindly for a pillow.  She squeezes it over

her face, moaning into it.

Noticing that Vicky now can't see him, Kevin cautiously

pulls out The Bible from under the bed.  Sets it next to

her.  He constantly refers from the book to Vicky, and

back again.

INT. VICKY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

VICKY'S MOM is straining some pasta.  On the fridge, we

see a collage in tribute to Vicky -- her senior portrait,

National Honor Society certificate, a report card.

VICKY'S DAD is at the table reading the paper.  He gets

up with a GRUNT.

INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Vicky can barely control herself.  She SCREAMS into the

pillow.

INT. VICKY'S HOUSE - STAIRWELL - DAY

Vicky's dad is trudging up the stairs.

INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Vicky wrestles with her own ecstacy.  Groans.  Kevin

keeps referencing The Bible.  Whatever he's doing, it's

working.

INT. VICKY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Vicky's dad approaches the bedroom door.

INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Vicky is about to explode.  She pulls the pillow off her

face, gasping.

INT. VICKY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Vicky's dad reaches for the doorknob.

Vicky's dad shrugs, turns around, and heads back

downstairs.

INT. JIM'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jim's door opens...he winces...REVERSE to see Jim's dad

looking at the family portrait of Jim's family in the

hallway outside Jim's room, his back turned to Jim's

door.

Jim's dad continues to study the picture.  A beat.  Then

he turns around, like he just realized the door was open.

Jim can only shrugs in response.  He goes into the hall

and looks at the portrait.  A beat.

Jim's face drops, seeing his death unfold.

Jim's eyes dart about, looking for a place to hide.

Nauseated and entirely disoriented, Jim tries to stumble

back into his room.  He SMACKS the doorframe.  Keeps

going, slamming the door behind him.  A beat.

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

The football field also doubles as the lacrosse field.

East Great Falls is battling Central.  It's a rough game,

muddy, brutal.  We see Oz grunting and groaning, playing

very tough.

On the sidelines, we see Heather has shown up.  She's

watching the game -- and is impressed as she watches Oz's

agility and domination.  Oz runs up the field, cradling

the ball in his stick.  A couple CENTRAL PLAYERS try to

check him.  Heather cringes with each impact, and is then

excited to see Oz dodge his opponents.

Finally, Oz scores with a triumphant YELL.  Heather

CHEERS with the crowd as the EGF players congratulate

each other.

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

After the game.  Oz sees Heather waiting for him on the

sidelines.  He's about to run over when COACH MARSHALL

snags him --

FOLLOW WITH OZ as he trots over to Heather, covered in

mud.

A clod of mud falls from Oz's uniform onto Heather's

skirt.

Oz wipes the mud from his hands.  A beat.  Heather has

something to say that's not quite coming out.

Before she can finish, Stifler runs up, sweaty and

excited.

Oz is surprised at her directness.  Impressed.

A beat.

Stifler joins some other LACROSSE BUDDIES.

They share a smile.  Then Heather walks off towards her

car.  Oz trots off to Stifler and the other lacrosse

guys.

Oz laughs, embarrassed.

Stifler goes into what can only be described as the Spank-

Me-And-Fuck-Me-Like-A-Whore-Dance.

The other guys LAUGH.  Oz joins in, laughing in spite of

himself.  They all high-five.

And from the other side of the field, we see Heather

peering over at them.  Hardly believing it as Oz joins in

the laughter.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY

English class.  The TEACHER is wrapping up a lecture.

Jim, Kevin, and Oz sit in the back of the classroom in

one corner.

Kevin shrugs as the BELL RINGS.  Sherman passes by.

He CHUCKLES and exits.  The guys stand up, exiting the

classroom.

He taps a passing RANDOM CUTE GIRL on the shoulder.

She hurries off to tell her friends.  The guys exit the

classroom.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR HIGH LOCKERS - CONTINUING

Jim turns around -- to find Nadia is standing right in

front of him.  Jim says nothing.  Stuck.  Staring.  Oz

elbows him.  Jim gives a startled GRUNT.

Jim looks over to Kevin and Oz, who excitedly give him

encouraging looks and gestures.

The guys nod, "Yes!  Yes!"

Nadia walks off.  Jim collapses into Oz's and Kevin's

arms, like a marathon runner at the end of a race.  They

pat him heartily in congratulations.

EXT. RAST GREAT FALLS - SIDE OF SCHOOL - DAY

After school.  Oz is there as Heather pulls up in a new

Saab.

She hastily walks towards the school.

She hurries up more, breaking off from Oz, and enters the

school.  After a moment, he slowly heads in.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - LATER

Oz and Heather are singing with the group, at opposite

ends of the room.  It's a pop, contemporary arrangement

of "HOW SWEET IT IS."  It sounds jazzy, cool.

Oz looks dazed, like the wind's taken out of him.  He

sings along, distant.  Heather, almost defiantly, sings

clearer and better than ever.  Oz watches her, though she

never looks his way.  At the bride of the song, Heather

breaks into a solo.  She sings beautifully.  Oz is

hooked.

The Choir Teacher halts the song.

A beat as the Choir Teacher is impressed and Heather

looks indifferent.

The rest of the choir agrees, as Heather looks to Oz with

skepticism.

The group starts packing up.

She leaves.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS - LIBRARY - DAY

Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Stifler.

The guys ponder this.

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jim is setting the computer camera on top of the monitor.

The computer BINGS.

Jim sits.  Types a quick E-mail.  It reads:  "OH YEAH!

128.220.27.102/tempt/NadiaVision.  ENJOY!"

Jim scrolls through his list of E-mail addresses.

Highlights a listing.  Clicks "Send."

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Kevin and Finch sit in front of a computer.  Kevin is

unloading beer and chips from a grocery bag.

We see an image of Jim's bedroom on the computer screen.

It's a little strobed, but easily watchable.  Suddenly

Jim's face pops into frame.  He's adjusting the camera.

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

We see the same image on Jim's screen.  Jim turns off

just the monitor.  It looks like the computer is off --

the ruse is undetectable.

Jim's dad enters with Nadia.  She's in sweats and a

leotard, carrying a duffel bag over her shoulder.  Jim's

dad is delighted, fidgety, almost giddy.

Jim's dad gives a knowing look and exits.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BROTHER'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

STIFLER'S YOUNGER BROTHER, 11, a monster, is tugging at

Stifler, who sits at the computer, watching Jim's room.

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

She sets her duffel on Jim's bed.

Jim exits, closing the door behind him.

stairs.

INT. JIM'S HOUSE - CONTINUING

Jim's Mom and Dad are sitting downstairs.  Jim bolts

through the room.

He practically crashes through the door on his way out.

She turns and looks at her husband.  Both perplexed.

Jim trucks across the lawn to the door.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Kevin and Finch are watching the computer screen.

Finch simply waves off the question.  He's glued to the

screen.

Jim bursts into the room, breathless.

Jim grabs a seat by the computer.  All three guys watch,

transfixed.  Nadia is slipping out of her leotard.

Nadia's leotard is off.  Bra and panties.  Outstanding

body.

INTERCUT BETWEEN JIM'S BEDROOM and the guys around the

computer screen in Kevin's Bedroom.

Nadia pauses.  Looks in Jim's full-length mirror.

Admiring her body.

And...yes!  Nadia peels off her sportsbra.  Supple

breasts.  The guys are awestruck.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - DAY

Oz sits alone in the empty vocal jazz rehearsal area.  He

sighs, leafing through some sheet music.  It's as quiet

and boring as can be.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BROTHER'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Stifler and his brother are awestruck.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUING

Nadia still primps in the mirror.  Then she looks around.

Very carefully, she pokes through the stuff on Jim's

night table.

Nadia opens the night table.  Stops.  Jim flushes.  Nadia

delicately reaches into the night table as Jim crumbles.

She pulls out the stack of porno magazines.

Nadia takes a PENTHOUSE.  Starts thumbing through it.

She sits on Jim's bed.  Lingering on some pages.  Getting

aroused.

Welcome to every man's fantasy.  Nadia's hand wanders

into her panties.

The guys watch, completely blown away.  Nadia's lost

herself.

He BOLTS across the room.

EXT. KEVIN'S HOUSE - DAY

Jim sprints across the lawn.

EXT. STREET - DAY - CONTINUING

Jim leaps over a row of bushes.  Wipes out.  Gets up and

keeps running.

Jim crashes into the house and runs past his bewildered

parents.

He rushes up the stairs.  Jim's Dad looks hopeful.

INT. JIM'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUING

The PHONE RINGS.  Kevin answers.

INT. SHERMAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUING

Sherman sits in front of a computer.

Jim still waits outside his bedroom door.  Takes a deep

breath.  Looks upwards to the sky.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY

We see a bedroom full of GUYS.

INT. BASEMENT - DAY - SAME TIME

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jim stands there, bewildered.  Nadia hasn't noticed him,

eyes closed, still pleasuring herself.  Jim stands there,

watching, faltering.  Gathers his courage.  Finally, he

rolls his eyes and says --

Nadia's eyes flash open.

Jim sneaks a nervous glance over to the QuickCam.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY - SAME TIME

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUING

Nadia leans over to Jim's clock radio.  Turns it on.  We

hear COUNTRY MUSIC.  She flips the dial, and we hear A

FEW STATIONS FLIP BY.  Then a DRIVING, EURO-TECHNO SONG.

She turns to Jim.

He struts clumsily back and forth.  Takes his shirt off.

Swings it in a circle around his head...and lets go of

it, aiming for the QuickCam, where it lands.

Jim nods eagerly.  Concentrates on the music...as we see

the shirt slide off the camera.  Jim starts writhing to

the beat.  Like a hyperactive chicken.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BROTHER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUING

A GROUP OF GIRLS watches in amusement.

The LAUGH and dance mockingly along with Jim.

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUING

Jim tugs off his pants, dancing and tripping on them.

Jim is clearly excited by Nadia's prodding.  He does some

pathetically ridiculous move with his pants, sliding them

around his chest and neck.

INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUING

A GROUP OF GIRLS is watching.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY - SAME TIME

Kevin and Finch are now completely sickened.

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUING

Jim is straddled over a chair, grinding against the chair

Jim starts spanking his ass as he gyrates.

INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY - SAME TIME

The guys are all trying not to watch, yet still drawn to

the computer.

INT. JIM'S COMPUTER - DAY - CONTINUING

Jim dances over to her.  She pulls him onto the bed.

Kisses his neck.  Takes his hand.  Places it on her

thigh.

Jim GULPS.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BROTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY - SAME TIME

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jim's hand wanders up Nadia's leg.  She does the same to

him.  Blows in his ear.  Her hand is about to enter his

shorts.

And Jim is done.  Bang.  That's it.

He looks down at himself in terror.  Nadia sees.  Backs

away.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

INT. BASEMENT - DAY - SAME TIME

The stoners look...well, stoned.

INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

The girls are LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BROTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

Nadia is getting dressed.

She sees the desperation in his eyes.  Thinks about it.

Smiles.

Jim digs into the stack of pornos.  Grabs SHAVED.

She goes for this line.  Gives in.

She grabs him.  Starts caressing his body.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

INT. BASEMENT - DAY - SAME TIME

INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY

A CHEER goes up as the guys CELEBRATE.

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

Groping.  They're tangled in each other.  Nadia backs off

for a moment.  Slowly, teasing, she hooks her thumbs in

the sides of her panties.  Starts sliding them down.

CLOSE UP on Jim as his eyes bug out.  Yep, it is, and she

is.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jim is stuck.  Staring at Nadia.  She moves towards him.

Nadia is inches from his face.

Jim is trembling, straining with himself.  A shudder runs

through him.

And it's over, again.

INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUING

The girls are LAUGHING again.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

Nadia starts getting dressed.  Jim is whimpering.

She gathers her things.  Eyes Jim over.

Jim is stunned.  Ruined.  Nadia exits.  CLOSE on Jim's

tormented face as we hear...

EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY

Jim is walking through the courtyard, a bit dazed.  A

COUPLE GIRLS pass by him, giggling.  He trudges

along...noticing a CLIQUE OF GIRLS staring at him as he

passes by...and Stoner #1 giving him a peace sign...and

the Computer Nerd staring at him like a celebrity......

Jim's pace slows.  He hears a SNICKER behind him...he

slows even more, taking very careful steps...as he sees a

GIRL doing a really strange dance -- and his eyes pop out

as he sees that, yes, it's

EVERYONE is staring at him.  Jim pulls his coat up over

his face and hurries off into the school, like a fugitive

avoiding the media.  People APPLAUD and LAUGH.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALLWAY - DAY

Kevin and Oz catch up to Jim.  Here and there, people

still give Jim funny looks.

Kevin winces.

A nearby OLD JANITOR starts GUFFAWING at Jim as he walks

by.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY

Jim sits, waiting for class to start.  Miserable.  Some

students are obviously talking about him in the

background.  Others study and chat.

Next to Jim is Michelle -- the reject, band dork that

we've seen earlier.  She's got a flute case on her desk.

She's blabbering to Jim.  The kind of blabbering where

every other sentence sounds like a question, even though

it isn't.

Jim couldn't care.

Jim looks wistfully over at Nadia's empty desk.

Jim perks up the slightest bit.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - HALLWAY - A LITTLE LATER

Heather is walking down the hall.  She turns to go into

the Little Auditorium -- and through the window in the

door she sees Oz.  She stops.

Oz is singing, working through the solo.  Determined to

get it right.  He bounces his lacrosse ball off the

floor, in rhythm, keeping time.  There's one point that

he keeps getting stuck at and going back over.  Heather

watches this, softening as she sees that Oz is actually

putting his heart into it.  Finally he's frustrated --

He whips the lacrosse ball at the wall.  Heather recoils,

still watching, unseen by Oz.  After a moment, Oz cools

off.  He gets the ball, and diligently starts up again.

Heather is impressed.

INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Vicky is doing calculus homework, as Kevin looks on,

rubbing her shoulders.

She gives him a little kiss on his hand, continuing with

her work.  Kevin keeps rubbing her back, more serious.

Vicky stops working and turns, sitting up on the desk,

facing him.  Her mood has shifted, more romantic.

She takes his hand.  Readies herself, and declares.

Kevin falters.  This is definitely not what he was

expecting.  He's caught.  Trying to formulate a response.

A beat.  Vicky seems to know where he's coming from.

INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

Oz is closing up the store.  He looks up to see Heather

at the door.  Oz goes and opens it, surprised,

embarrassed.  The air is awkward between them.

She smiles.  Oz lets her in.

An uncomfortable moment for Oz.

INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Oz is behind the counter.  Heather walks down the other

side as Oz assembles a sub.

Oz cuts the sub in half with a flourish and puts it on a

tray.

A beat...a little uncomfortable, but nice.

EXT. SUBWAY - NIGHT - LATER

The remains of a couple subs are on a table.  Oz and

Heather are doing their song...it's rough, but they're

working through it.  And when they're in sync, they sound

really good together.  We SLOWLY PULL BACK as they sing

into the night.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MURAL STAIRCASE - DAY

A GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH talks to Stifler.

Flustered, she heads down the stairs.  Stifler, entirely

confused, heads off into the second floor.  As the Girl

Holding Out For Finch descends, Kevin catches up with

her.

EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY

Kevin is talking to GRETA.  She points offscreen.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LIBRARY - DAY

Kevin is talking to SOME CHICK.  Taking notes.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - OUTDOOR MURAL - DAY

Kevin is talking to YET ANOTHER GIRL.  We see that his

notepad is a spiderweb of girl's names, all interlinked

with arrows.  They all point to one girl's name in the

center of the page -- Jessica.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY

Kevin follows Jessica down the cafeteria line.

Kevin is speechless.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GUY'S SHOWERS/LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Toweled guys exit the steamy showers, doing a macho GREAT

FALLS LACROSSE CHANT.  They exit frame, and we remain on

the showers, to hear --

He exits in a towel and goes to his locker, next to

Stifler.

Stifler is staring at Oz, horrified.

Oz stops.

EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD, A BENCH - LATER

Heather is studying outside.  Oz stands before her,

breathless, his hair still wet.

An uncomfortable moment.  Oz walks off.  Heather looks

let down.

EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - ENTRANCE TO SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY

Kevin is at his locker, getting ready for class.  Stifler

comes running up with a wicked grin on his face.

Stifler pulls out an empty bottle of PRESCRIPTION

LAXATIVE, maniacally LAUGHING.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY

Finch is sitting at a table, reading his paper.  Kevin

comes tearing around the corner and runs up to him.

Finch jumps up and sprints down the hallway.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - CONTINUING

We FOLLOW with Finch.  We see Stifler down the hall,

holding open the bathroom door like a pleasant doorman.

Finch darts into the bathroom.  Stifler LAUGHS

hysterically.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY

Finch leaps into a stall and slams the door behind him.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

Finch has stopped.  He's staring down at the toilet.  It

looks entirely uninviting.  But he's straining,

struggling, starting to dance around, moaning as he

cramps up.

He grabs a length of toilet paper and lines the seat with

it.  Then another, and another.  Sweat drips off his

forehead.

He's got the seat lined with at least three layers of

toilet paper.  Notices a spot where there's still bare

toilet seat.  He tears off one square of toilet paper,

placing it on the spot.  He steps back and looks it over,

still wriggling to contain his bowels.

He unbuckles his pants.  Sits down -- just as we hear

someone enter the bathroom.  Finch, still restraining,

listens for a moment...only to hear the CLICK-CLICK-CLICK

of heels.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - DAY

The bathroom door swings closed to reveal the universal

symbol for "Women."  Stifler is there, LAUGHING even

harder.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

Finch is terrified.  Through the crack between the stall

door and the frame, Finch catches glimpses of bright

colored skirts and dresses.  He grits his teeth,

straining.

And a GURGLE comes from Finch's stomach.  His eyes bulge.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY

A GROUP OF GIRLS is at the mirror, including the Girl

Holding Out for Finch, fixing their hair.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

Finch is in hell.  Desperately trying not to shit.

Holding it in for all he's worth.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

Pure agony.  Finch is sweating badly.  Every muscle in

his body is tensed.  Tears stream from his fiercely shut

eyes.

A gastric RUMBLING.  Finch's eyes flash open in terror.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY

We hear another, deeper RUMBLING.  Girl #2 turns to her

friend in surprise.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

Finch is struggling.  Rocking back and forth.  But it's

no use.  He's at his limit.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY

The girls at the mirror freeze -- and we hear what can

only be the SOUND OF DIARRHEA exploding into a toilet

bowl.

The girls run out SCREAMING and LAUGHING.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Finch exits the stall with trepidation, pulling up his

pants.  Slowly, slinking, he approaches the door.  Grabs

the handle.  Composes himself.  And like nothing ever

happened, he opens it.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - DAY

Finch comes out of the bathroom.  Stops.  His eyes

register complete disbelief.

A SEMI-CIRCLE OF GIRLS, including the ones we have seen

gossiping about him, has crowded around the door.  All

staring at him with complete repugnance, open-mouthed.

EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY

Oz is playing in the final lacrosse game.  The team

scores -- they're beating Central.  Everyone cheers,

except Oz.  We see Jim and Kevin in the stands, CHEERING.

EXT. MUSIC HALL (MSU) - DAY

Establishing.  The campus of Michigan State University.

Students pass in front of an older, impressive university

building.

A sign out front reads, "MICHIGAN STATEWIDE VOCAL

COMPETITION."

INT. BACKSTAGE (MSU) - DAY

Heather and the rest of the vocal jazz group are behind

the curtain.

They all wear flashy, borderline cool outfits.  Heather

looks worried, lost.  Looking to the door, as if Oz might

come running in.

ALBERT steps next to Heather.  He's kind of funny-

looking, with an overly-suave attitude that comes off as

plain weird.

He SINGS a couple lines.  Way too melodramatic and

cheesy.  Heather looks trapped.

EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY

A scoreboard shows that East is leading by five goals.

Oz is running up the field, towards the goal, cradling

the ball in his stick.  He seems to have a good lead.

Suddenly he is tumbling, falling, losing the ball.

Someone has checked him.  He lays stunned on the ground,

as Stifler recovers the ball and scores.

The players run back to the sidelines to reset for the

face-off, and gather around the coach.

The team is getting into it.  Shouts of "Hell yeah!"  But

Oz's got a quizzical look on his face.

INT. BACKSTAGE (MSU) - DAY

Heather waits with the group to go onstage.  Albert paces

like a Shakespearean actor, psyching himself.

EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY

Oz shows some emotion peeking through.  Confused.

A wave of realization washes over Oz.  He stands up tall.

Oz collects himself.  Takes a deep breath.

he sets his lacrosse stick down and starts to leave.

Coach Marshall is fuming.  The entire team is staring at

Oz.

He runs off.

ANGLE ON JIM AND KEVIN IN THE STANDS

A beat of confusion.  Then they stand up.

EXT. MSU CAMPUS - DAY

Oz runs through a gate.

INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY

The vocal jazz group is on their feet, lined up, waiting

to go onstage.  Oz bursts into the room, still in his

lacrosse gear.

Oz rushes up to Heather.  She's happy but confused.

Heather melts.  Oz pulls her close.  And they kiss.

Oz and Heather share a smile.

INT. MUSIC HALL STAGE - DAY

The vocal jazz group is belting their hearts out, singing

"How Sweet It Is."  Oz sings with them now in his vocal

jazz outfit...we TILT DOWN to see he's still wearing his

cleats.  He and Heather sound great, backed by the vocal

jazz group.  They sail through their duet, join hands,

and finish perfectly.  The audience APPLAUDS with

enthusiasm -- and we Kevin and Jim, WHOOPING AND

CLAPPING, loving it, like they're at a rock concert.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS - CLASSROOM - DAY

Class has just ended, students are filing out of the

classroom.  A teacher grades papers in the back of the

room, routinely writing "A, A-, A, A-" on each paper.

Vicky is studying a pull-down map hanging over the

chalkboard.  Kevin comes up next to her.

A beat.  Kevin looks back over his shoulder to the

inattentive teacher.  Moves closer to Vicky.

Vicky looks over to the teacher, who COUGHS.  She steps

closer.  Kevin, somewhat nervous, takes the bottom of the

map, fidgeting with it a little.

The map goes FLAPPING upwards.  The teacher looks up.

She looks to the calendar on the wall...and taps next

Saturday -- "Prom."  Kevin can't believe it...MUSIC UP

for PRE-PROM MONTAGE --

INT. TUXEDO LAND - DAY

Jim is trying on a tux.  he shrugs, like it fits well

enough.

He turns to see Oz trying on his -- Oz is fidgeting,

trying on different ties, vests, shoes, very sincere and

focused.

INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Vicky is trying on a rather elegant dress, looking to

Jessica for support, showing it off.  Jessica jokingly

does the same, showing off her shorts and T-shirt, as if

she could care.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY

Finch sits alone.  Not like alone.  More like Forrest

Gump.

INT. TUXEDO LAND - DAY

Jim is paying for his tux.  We see Oz trying to decide on

a cumberbund.  There are about ten of them scattered

around him that he's already tried.  In the background,

an ATTENDANT looks impatient.

EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY

Finch still sits.  His head is cocked at a different

angle.

INT. JIM'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jim's dad fixes Jim's bow tie.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (END MONTAGE)

Kevin is in his tux.  He's staring at himself in the

mirror.

EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NIGHT

The parking lot is full.  VARIOUS FORMALLY DRESSED

STUDENTS make their way into the school.  One group piles

out of a stretch limo.  We see a STEALTHY STUDENT slip a

bottle of liquor into his tux.  A FLUSTERED GUY struggles

to re-attach his date's corsage.

This is the prom.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GYM - NIGHT

The gym is decorated in a clashingly festive manner.

Like a combination of Mardi Gras, New Year's Eve, and

somebody's bar mitzvah.  A CRAPPY BAND plays CRAPPY

IMITATION ROCK MUSIC.

Most students mill about, talking, generally bored.  The

only people who are enjoying themselves are the OBVIOUSLY

DRUNK STUDENTS, slam-dancing with the obviously drunk

Stifler in a corner.  CHAPERONE PARENTS try to calm them

down, futilely.

The band breaks into a CHEESY BALLAD.  Couples lock

together and sway back and forth like zombies.

ANGLE ON JIM AND MICHELLE

They're dancing at arm's length.  Jim is not enthused.

ANGLE ON KEVIN AND VICKY

They dance.  Both looking a little nervous.  Anxious.

ANGLE ON OZ AND HEATHER

Dancing much slower than anyone else.  Tight embrace.

Heather's got her head on his shoulder, eyes closed.

ANGLE ON STIFLER

Dancing with the Girl Holding out For Finch.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - A CORNER OF THE GYM - NIGHT

Kevin, Oz, Jim, and Finch are hanging out.  Finch is

drunk.

Sherman passes by.

The guys are impassive.  Sherman indicates the Central

Girl nearby.

Sherman confidently walks off.

Kevin is taken aback.

Kevin storms off.  A beat.

Jessica approaches.  She's dressed well, but not

lavishly.

Finch looks to the guys.  They shrug.  We FOLLOW WITH

Jessica and Finch as they dance out onto the floor.

ANGLE ON VICKY AND CENTRAL GIRL

EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NIGHT

Kevin sits on the steps into the school, depressed.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GYM - NIGHT

The Central Girl has taken over the band's microphone.

Her voice reverberates throughout the gym.  A couple WOLF-

WHISTLES.

Girls around the gym CHEER and APPLAUD.

ANGLE ON SHERMAN

Pissing his pants.

ANGLE ON JIM

Shocked.  He looks back to Oz, who shares his expression.

EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NIGHT

Kevin still sits there.  Jim, Oz, and Finch come out of

the school.  Slowly they walk up to Kevin.

A beat as the guys don't know what to say.  Kevin's

speech is halting, downbeat.

A beat.  Oz shrugs.

A beat as Kevin ponders this.

The guys LAUGH as Kevin is puzzled.  THEY are suddenly

illuminated by the glare of headlights.  A charter bus

pulls in front of the school.

Jim holds out a helping hand.  Kevin looks at it.  Grabs

it, and Jim pulls him up.

EXT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

A beautiful cottage on the shore of Lake Michigan.

Students are filing out of the charter bus.

Jim and Michelle are walking up to the cottage.

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM

Kevin leads Vicky into the bedroom.  A large bay window

overlooks moonlit Lake Michigan.

Vicky opens a closet -- to find Stifler's Little Brother

inside, grinning.

Stiflers brother is gone.  They LAUGH...and Vicky closes

the door.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Oz and Heather are walking down the beach.  Holding

hands.  Deep in the background, we see kids partying.

She nods.  They stop walking.  Oz swipes his feet around

in the sand.

Heather is listening.

He takes her hand.

Heather softens, taken off guard.

Oz seems truly touched.

Heather nods, and speaks pensively.

Through their laughter, they kiss.  After a moment, it

grows more passionate.  Lost in each other.

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

The party rages in the rest of the cottage, but the

basement is empty.  STIFLER'S MOM sits in the corner,

smoking a cigarette.  She's as attractive as her photo we

once saw, but the divorce has replaced her sexy smile

with a bitter smirk.

Finch stumbles in.

Finch pauses a moment.  He's got an idea.

She considers him as she drags off her cigarette.

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - PARTY ROOM - NIGHT

It's a great party.  Stifler is with a group of guys

drinking a beer, which he inspects very carefully before

every sip.

ANGLE ON JIM AND MICHELLE

Both drinking and talking, almost enjoying themselves.

Ding!  A light goes off in Jim's head.

Jim's expression sinks.

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The lights are down.  Vicky and Kevin are in bed.

A beat.

He pulls out a condom.  A beat as they contemplate it.

A moment as they realize there's nothing left to do, but -

Kevin swallows hard.  And says --

They both take a deep breath.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Oz and Heather lay in a secluded spot in the dunes,

surrounded by tall beach grass that swishes in the spring

breeze.  Stars and a lustrous moon above.

The silence speaks.  We can see it in their eyes.

Yearning.

They kiss.  It's time.

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

A brief moment of uncertainty.  Kevin shifts around a

bit, trying to position himself.  Vicky's hand goes under

the sheets.

We know what she's doing.  They both maintain eye

contact...

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Heather and Oz are re-inventing the idea of passion.

Discovering love.  This is the stuff that you thought

only existed in romance novels.  Seriously.

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - PARTY ROOM - NIGHT

Jim is trying to stay interested in Michelle's drivel.

Jim CHOKES on his beer.  Michelle considers her

revelation no big deal, watching with some amusement as

Jim struggles to recover.

Jim is ga-ga.  He watches in disbelief as she lets her

hair down.  And wouldn't you know it, she's pretty cute.

Jim pauses in disbelief.  Then --

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Michelle and Jim burst in and slam the door.  A toy

basketball hoop falls off the back of the door.  They are

standing in a cluttered, toy-strewn, pit of a kid's room.

One of those stupid plastic airplanes on a string hangs

from the ceiling, flying in circles.

Jim heartily agrees.

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

The scotch bottle is almost empty.  Stifler's Mom and

Finch are smoking cigarettes.

One look between them, and we know it's all over.

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kevin and Vicky.  Silently doing it.  Curious looks on

their faces.  The look you get when your waiter delivers

your food in a fancy restaurant, and you look at the

creation on the plate, and secretly you're not sure if

it's really what you ordered.  But you don't say

anything, and you just eat it.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Oz and Heather.  Souls entwined.  Making love.

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

We can hear Jim and Michelle going at it like a couple of

HOWLING BANSHEES over a SERIES OF SHOTS:

-- A piggy bank gets knocked over and shatters.

-- An x-wing fighter flies across the room.

-- A pillow explodes in a cloud of feathers.

-- One of the legs on the bed breaks.

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - OUTSIDE BASEMENT DOOR - NIGHT

The Basement door is closed.  We hear from the inside...

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jim and Michelle going at it.  Again, we HEAR but can't

see them.  The room is more trashed than before.  And as

we PAN across the disaster area they've created --

We see her...on top of Jim.  She clears her throat.  And

then we see her raise a children's plastic recorder to

her lips -- and she whistles THE MICHIGAN FIGHT SONG.  On

cue, Jim chimes in --

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Oz could be coming.  Heather could be coming.  But it's

all so darn passionate that the whole thing looks like

one big orgasm anyway.

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jim and Michelle lay on the floor, tangled in sheets and

each others' clothing.  Exhausted, gasping.

And then we see the closet door is open, just a crack.

It swings open.  Standing there is Stifler's Little

Brother.  Jaw hanging.

Jim and Michelle are stunned.

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

Finch and Stifler's Mom are just off-camera.  We can't

see it, but we can tell Finch's status from his ORGASMIC

MOANING.

What we

chair falling out of place.  And the door opening as

Stifler walks in.  He stops, horrified.

He looks like he's going to barf.  Instead, he passes

out.

EXT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - SUNRISE - ESTABLISHING

The sun rises over Lake Michigan.  A brand new day.

Various students are passed out here and there.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Oz holds Heather in his arms.  Completely peaceful.

SEAGULLS CALL to each other.  WAVES BREAK on the shore.

Oz has lost all pretense.  Smiling to himself, or maybe

to the world.

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jim wakes up in bed, alone.  He looks around.

He considers this.

He considers this further.  Smiles.

He jumps up and does a little dance, SINGING...

INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAY

Kevin and Vicky lie next to each other in bed, staring at

the ceiling.  Though they're trying to conceal it, we can

see a bit of dissatisfaction, uncertainty, peeking

through.

A beat.

Another beat.

Kevin thinks this over.

A moment as they think this over.

Kevin gives an embarrassed smile.

EXT. DOG DAYS - DAY

A sign on the window reads, "Congratulations Seniors!"

INT. DOG DAYS - DAY

The four, newly non-virgins munch on hot dogs.  Kevin's

LAUGHING.

They GROAN.  Oz just smiles.

They guys keep eating, uncertain what to say.

A beat.  Kevin raises his Pepsi.

They all toast.

INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Kevin is on the phone.

INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BACK OF LIBRARY - DAY

Kevin arrives in the back of the library.  Kneels down to

put the bible back.

We hear Kevin's Brother CHUCKLE knowingly.

He puts the bible back without the reverence he once had

for it.  Stands up with some new confidence.  We FOLLOW

WITH HIM as he walks out of the library...and enters the

courtyard, crowded with students.  He disappears into

them as we...

ROLL CREDITS

INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jim's dad sits across from Jim.

Jim beams proudly.

INT. A HOTEL HALLWAY

SUPER:  "PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC"

A WAITER ascends a beautiful, red-carpeted staircase,

carrying a tray with bottle of champagne and a rose.  He

arrives in front of a hotel door.  KNOCKS.  A BELLBOY

passes by, noticing the waiter.  And HE SPEAKS TO HIM IN

AUTHENTIC, THICK CZECH.

The door opens -- to reveal Jim, sweaty but not the least

bit tired, tying on a robe.

A pair of arms wraps around him from behind.  And --

Nadia peeks her head over Jim's shoulder.

Jim smiles to the guys and takes the tray, as Nadia pulls

him back in and closes the door.

They head off.
