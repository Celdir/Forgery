Withnail and I

Withnail and I

Camden Town, London. 1969

The Flat.

[A few shafts of sunlight sneak through the curtains and illuminate a

sitting room. There are empty bottles everywhere. 'I', who is smoking a

joint, gets up somewhat precariously and walks into a kitchen which is full

of bottles and dirty washing up. He lights the gas on the stove and puts on

the kettle.]

['I' knocks on the door to Withnail's bedroom]

I:

[He waits for a response.]

I:

Withnail:

['I' leaves the flat, slamming the front door behind him]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cafe

['I' is reading a paper at a table in the cafe. The proprietor is cooking

eggs in a frying pan full of grease. She takes one out, inserts it between

two slices of bread and places it in front of an elderly woman who inspects

it doubtfully and bites into the sandwhich. Yolk runs out of the other

edge. 'I' turns his attention to his paper. The story is about a

transexual, the headline 'Love made up my mind, I had to become a woman'.

He looks around at the other customers.]

I [mentally]:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Flat

[I stumbles up the barely lit stairs looking unwell. Withnail emerges from

his room holding a bottle and glass and follows him.]

Withnail:

Withnail [pouring some wine]:

[I goes into the kitchen which is by now full of steam and turns off the

kettle. Withnail follows him around reading from a newspaper.]

Withnail:

I:

Withnail [reading from the paper]:

[I pours water from the kettle into a bowl and goes back into the living

room. Withnail follows him.]

Withnail:

[Withnail stands infront of a mirror and brushes his long, greasy hair with

a comb. I sits on the settee and starts drinking the coffee from the bowl

using a spoon.]

Withnail:

The Flat

[I is writting in a notebook on the settee while Withnail wonders round

wearing his overcoat and his underpants, smearing himself with deep heat.]

I [mentally]:

I'm inclined to believe Withnail is right; we are indeed drifting into the

arena of the unwell. Making an enemy of our own future. What we need is

harmony. Fresh air. Stuff like that.

Withnail:

I:

could go away.

Withnail [inspecting a bottle for dregs]:

like Greenland in here. We've got to get some booze. It's the only solution

to this intense cold. Something's got to be done. We can't go on like this.

I'm a trained actor reduced to the status of a bum. I mean look at us!

Nothing that reasonable members of society demand as their rights! No

fridges, no televisions, no phones. Much more of this and I'm going to

apply for meals on wheels.

I:

Withnail:

happened to my agent? Bastard must have died.

I:

Withnail:

retire.

[He picks up a paper.]

Withnail:

[He points accusingly at I.]

Withnail: Have you been at the controls!?

I:

Withnail:

I:

Withnail:

[He lunges towards the mantlepiece where there is a bottle of lighter

fluid.]

I [standing up]:

Withnail:

I:

Withnail:

[He pours the contents of the bottle into his upturned mouth.]

Withnail:

[I shakes his head. Withnail presses forwards and I backs off.]

Withnail:

I:

Withnail:

I:

Withnail:

[The large Irish gentleman in the corner gets up and walks over to them.

Now he is upright we see he is very large indeed and does not look

friendly.]

Big Irish man:

Withnail (smiling):

Big Irish man:

[As he says this he jerks the scarf from around Withnail's neck.]

Withnail:

Withnail:

[They push past the man and rush to the door.]

Monte's house

[A battered Jag pulls up outside Monte's house and Withnail and I get out.

There is a rather flash looking open-topped Rolls parked outside. The sound

of a Schubert piano sonata comes from the house.]

Withnail:

[Withnail knocks on the door. Monte, a rather fat, effeminate, middle-aged

gentleman, opens the door. He is holding a very large fluffy cat and a

watering can.]

Monty:

[They enter and go into the lounge.]

Monty:

[They sit together on a sette.]

Withnail:

Monty:

I:

Monty:

[Monty moves to the sideboard and pours the drinks. Withnail lights up yet

another cigarette.]

Monty:

started to grow last summer. I happen to think the cauliflower more

beautiful than the rose.

Withnail:

[He drinks the sherry.]

Monty:

Withnail:

Monty:

[Withnail turns and reaches a bottle over from the sideboard. He takes a

long swig. ]

I:

Withnail:

I:

[There is a yowl from the cat. Monte storms back into the room preceded by

the cat.]

Monty:

[He deposits his considerable bulk on the other settee, facing the first.]

Withnail:

Monty:

[I smiles wriley to himself. Withnail downs the drink he has prepared for

himself, pours another and starts making the Bloody Mary for Monty.]

Withnail:

Monty:

Withnail:

Monty:

[Withnail delivers Monte's drink and sits beside him.]

Withnail:

[Later, I is washing his hands in the sink having finished getting the

chickens guts out. Withnail enters with a shotgun and points it at I's

head.]

I:

Withnail:

[He pokes the chicken with the gun. It still has a few feathers.]

Withnail:

I:

[He tries to push the chicken into a kettle but it is too large to fit.]

Withnail:

I:

[He removes the chicken and takes it to the fire. Opening the oven, he

removes Withnail's steaming boots and points the the brick in the oven.]

I:

[He sits the chicken on the brick.]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A phonebox

[I is smoking stood outside the phonebox waiting for Withnail.]

[He emerges from the phonebox.]

[I fishes around in his pocket and finds a shilling for Withnail who goes

back into the phonebox and dials.]

[He takes out his frustration on the phone, hitting it for a while then

leaves the phonebox.]

[Returning from Penryth they walk accross a field. I is carrying some

shopping.]

[He hands the bag to Withnail and opens a gate. It is clearly marked 'Shut

this gate']

[Withnail slams the gate behind them but it doesn't fasten. They see Parkin

on his tractor.]

[Parkin turns the tractor towards them, stops and runs towards them.]

[A bull appears and pushes the gate open. Withnail thrusts the bag into I's

hands and vaults the wall. I is left facing the bull in a narrow corridor

between two walls.]

[Withnail has his cigarettes out and is lighting up.]

[He shouts and throws the shopping in the air. The bull roars, I shouts

again and runs at it. It turns and retreats to its field.]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fields

[It is dark. The silloutes of Withnail and I appear on the skyline.]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Crow and Crown

[Withnail and I are stood at the bar.]

[Raymond, the publican, gets the drink and takes the money for them. In

opening the till he just avoids falling over. Withnail and I suppress

laughter.]

[They take their drinks to a table.]

[Rather later, the pair are the only remaining customers. Raymond, wiping

down the bar, is clearly leggless.]

[The door clatters open and a man in a thick coat walks in, leans over the

bar and helps himself to a beer. I nudges Withnail. The man takes an eel

from his trousers which wriggles around violently. He strikes its head on

the bar and returns it to his trousers.]

[They approach the bar.]

[He removes a pheasant from under his coat.]

[He takes the cigarette from Withnail's mouth and takes a draw. I gives him

the remains of a packet.]

[They make to leave]
