CONTINUED:

She ignores him

She keeps moving, until she sees the male of her dreams:

He stands a bit apart from the rest. And what a voice. What a

hip movement. She sings along.

Close up on the two penguins as their necks intertwine.

THE ICE SHELF

With infinite care, THE EGG is passed from Norma J's feet

onto WISHFUL's.

WISHFUL covers the egg, glancing up at the darkening sky

Women are leaving and heading off over the ice. The community

resounds with sad songs of parting.

CONTINUED:

Norma J is having difficulty tearing herself away. Finally

she pads off after the others.

As he watches her dwindle into the distance, where huge STORM

CLOUDS are building.

THE DARKNESS

Wind comes shreiking across the ice shelf to where THOUSANDS

OF MALES are huddled, ice crusting on their feathers.

The huddled penguins are engaged in ritual chanting

INSIDE THE HUDDLE

The adult males are packed shoulder to shoulder, looking

downwards at the eggs balanced on their feet.

CU on the Lead male, a CARUSO

CONTINUED:

OUTSIDE

WINDWARD PENGUINS peel off and walk around to the leeward

side. WISHFUL is among them

WIDE SHOT

The MASSED VOICES rise above the gale, the frosty plumes of

their breath forming a shared `thought bubble'...a benevolent

UBERPENGUIN.

As the chanting builds, a little thought-bubble appears next

to the communal imagination: An image of Norma J

WISHFUL raises his head, breaking the seal. A little puff of

steam escapes

CONTINUED:

Penguins around him start jostling to close the gap

An egg rolls out of the HUDDLE and onto the ICE.

WISHFUL barges out of the huddle, retrieves the egg and

waddles back into the warmth again.

Pulling back, till the powerful rhythmic chanting is drowned

out by the HOWLING GALE.

We are moving in again, towards the huddle, the voices of the

Great Male Gathering begin to cut through the wind blasts.

Louder and louder, until...

CONTINUED: (2)

The CHANTING crescendos, awe-inspiring, as it rises above the

sound of the gale, and, as if in response

THE EARTH TURNS!

The CURTAIN OF DARKNESS which overshadows Antarctica begins

to LIFT from the curvature of the southern hemisphere. The

vast ice-continent is BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED once more.

ON THE ICE SHELF

The ICE itself is moaning and groaning, like a living thing.

A SINGLE CRACK appears and widens, then forks and forks

again.

The whole expanse of fast-ice is DISINTEGRATING, starting at

the sea-ice and progressing towards the ice-cliffs.

Somewhere an ICEBERG breaks free from the face of a glacier

and smashes down into the frozen sea below. At the same

time...

THE EMPEROR COMMUNITY

An EGG cracks open, then another, then all in a rush, like

POPCORN.

Fathers are calling out to each other as their fluffy CHICKS

emerge to greet the daylight.

Amongst the excited crowd of males and hatchlings we find

WISHFUL staring down at his egg still balanced on his feet.

CONTINUED:

He taps the egg with his beak. Bending close they hear a

TAPPING SOUND in REPLY.

WISHFUL taps again. The tapping comes back louder. A TINY

FOOT pops out of the egg. Then ANOTHER. The Egg flips and

lurches off in a giddy DANCE.

THE FRIENDLY PENGUIN'S chick giggles at the DANCING EGG,

which finally trips and cracks, depositing baby MUMBLE.

They gather round staring down at this strange little jigging

ball of fluff

Shovelling MUMBLE off the ice and into his BROOD POUCH.

Mumble SNUGGLES contentedly between his father's legs,

surveying his new world. The friend's chick, ELLA is staring

at him fascinated

CONTINUED: (2)

She disappears under his brood pouch

THE ICE

A LONG LINE of male penguins, thousands of them, all with

their chicks, stand staring expectantly across the ice shelf.

At the front, we find WISHFUL and MUMBLE, who is jiggling

with anticipation, hopping from one foot to the other.

MUMBLE does a little SOFT SHOE SHUFFLE.

CONTINUED:

Caruso waddles past: A stern glance down at little Mumble as

he carries on along the line

LATER

MIST rises off the ice shelf. The males are still waiting

with their chicks. Over this: The sound of Chicks crying.

MUMBLE between his father's feet, follows his father's

concentrated gaze.

Long pause

STILL LATER

The baby penguins are HOWLING now.

Anxious fathers lean forward, peering into the distance.

Out of the thickening mist, a cluster of little BLACK DOTS

materialises.

The distant females look exhausted as they totter unsteadily

across the ice towards their partners. The MALES break ranks

and rush towards the distressed females.

CONTINUED:

A tumult of re-unions as partners find each other. But no

luck for WISHFUL.

Weaving anxiously through the throng, overhearing:

WISHFUL, is running frantically through the crowd, singing

all the time in the hope of being recogniosed

MUMBLE hippity-hops after his father, trying to keep up...

Moving beyond the crowd, WISHFUL sees a last few stragglers.

Amongst them...

CONTINUED: (2)

She staggers into his waiting flippers.

Over WISHFUL' shoulder, she sees the infant Mumble HIPPITY-

HOPPING towards them.

Mumbles feet start to tap involuntarily, Then he catches his

dad's warning look.

THE GREAT COMMUTE

The ICE-SHELF is as busy as a freeway at peak hour with males

and females are hurrying BACK AND FORTH from the sea.

THE CRECHE

An efficient, caring TEACHER is giving a lesson to a class of

about thirty young chicks grouped in front of her.

MANY flippers go up.

Mumble looks astonished. What's more important than that

CONTINUED:

A few flippers go up

He hesitates, as if listening to something in his head.Then,

he sings UTTERLY TUNELESS, like a drum solo.

Mumble is still going. TITTERS and SNIGGERS from the class.

CONTINUED: (2)

A croaky monotone.   The class LAUGHS OPENLY.

The class fall about in HYSTERICS.

LATER

MUMBLE's PARENTS are talking to the TEACHER.

Wishful shuffles guiltily.

CONTINUED:

MRS ASTRAKHAN'S

Some distance from the creche, MUMBLE stands with MRS

ASTRAKHAN, a Russian-accented remedial teacher.

CU on MUMBLE looking up.

MUMBLE closes his eyes.

Her voice is seductive, hypnotic.

She hears a strange TAPPING sound and looks down.

CONTINUED:

Once again his feet start twitching uncontrollably.

Mumble opens his beak, inspired.

CONTINUED: (2)

Mumble inhales, his eyes are shining, his body is shaking.

He's off again, DANCING LIKE A FOOL...wild, exuberant, totally

uninhibited and unselfconscious.

After some time, he remembers himself, stops and turns to the

Mrs Astrakhan who is BANGING HER HEAD against a lump of ice.

THE ICE SHELF

Follow Mumble as he wanders alone, back towards his class.

He stops some distance away, listening to the other kids who

are now performing with increasing virtuosity.

Ella is among them, her clear high voice borne to him on the

wind.

Mumble sighs and his little shoulders sink, no way he'll ever

be able to sing like that.

A piece of downy fluff is peeling off one wing

Music over: Walk on By as he wanders through the vast colony

head down against the wind, little feet padding over the ice,

Gradually the colony begins to thin.

The noise of the colony has faded behind him. He stops and

looks up.

CONTINUED:

THE EDGE

Before him, a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with

broken eggs and bits of feather. There are very few penguins

here and the ones he can see are all, frankly, weird.

A Penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to

himself. Another has his flippers wrapped tightly around

himself like a straightjacket. A troubled Penguin sings

angrily..."There's no business like show business.

CU on Mumble. As he looks back to the sanctuary of the colony

and then back out over the wasteland

Fade in Music: (I'm Free by the Who) and Mumble is off,

skittering over the rubbish strewn ice, little feet dancing

to his hearts content until....

a shadow passes over him and

Whump! a huge SKUA BIRD, twice Mumbles size, with a cruel

flesh-eating beak, lands on the ice right on front of him.

THREE MORE SKUAS descend. MUMBLE is surrounded.

CONTINUED:

Their dark eyes fix on Mumble. He is starting to feel uneasy

and backs away.

The FIRST SKUA moves in on MUMBLE.

They fall over each other, fighting to take up Mumble's

invitation.

The Skuas stop momentarily.

He does a wild little TAPDANCE hoping to distract them.

CONTINUED: (2)

He knocks Mumble down and places his HUGE CLAW on his chest.

The FIRST SKUA opens his beak to strike. Mumble has noticed a

YELLOW PLASTIC BAND around the Skua's leg.

The FIRST SKUA halts his attack.

He turns and whacks the other SKUAS over the head with his

wing.

MUMBLE takes a few steps back, looking for an escape.The

FIRST SKUA towering over him...

CONTINUED: (3)

Mumble keeps backing off, feigning interest...

CONTINUED: (4)

He opens his beak wide as MUMBLE stumbles backwards and falls

into a narrow CREVICE in the ice.

The other Skuas move in to help. MUMBLE cowers in the CRACK

as they spear at him with their beaks.

They can't get hold of him. Frustrated, they turn on the

FIRST SKUA, squabbling and whacking each other with their

wings.

MUMBLE watches from the safety of the crack as they fight and

argue viciously among themselves

THE CRECHE

MUMBLE stands some distance back from where the other young

penguins are taking school lessons.

MUMBLE looks up at a cloud that resolves itself into the

unmistakable shape of a FISH. As he watches, the cloud morphs

into something that resembles a WHALE. Then morphs again

into...a SEAL. Then into the shape of an upright CREATURE with

bulging eyes and tentacled hands.

CONTINUED:

TIME LAPSE

As the class transforms into moulting adolescents

LATER. THE GRADUATION CEREMONY

Dozens of MATURE ADOLESCENTS...their coats almost fully moulted

to reveal the sleek, shiny black and white feathers

underneath.

They stand in a group talking excitedly until the lead

penguin, Caruso, walks up and everyone falls silent

With solemn gravity, CARUSO throws his flippers into the air

and shouts.

AWAY FROM THE CRECHE

Follow Mumble as he returns to his parents. In his adult

plumage he's distinguishable by a small birthmark, like a

bowtie on his chest and a small tuft of down on his head

which has not yet moulted off.

Music Over: Schools Out by Alice Cooper

NORMA J. puts a protective flipper around her son.

Glancing round he sees the class moves off en masse across

the ice...heading for the sea.

Wishful leans forwards, pulls off Mumbles tuft with his beak.

He races off, Norma J calling after him:

Mumble turns to wave, falls over, gets up and races on after

the others with his strange hippity-hop little gait.

CONTINUED:

Watching from a distance, Norma J wipes away tears

Wishful pats her comfortingly

THE HIGHWAY TO THE SEA

A high shot reveals the miles of frozen ice that the

GRADUATES have to cover to get to the sea.

Some are shuffling along on their feet; others are

tobogganing.

A long way behind them we see the lone figure of MUMBLE

racing to catch up.

AT THE EDGE OF THE ICE

The juvenile penguins stand in a bunch, peering down looking

for somewhere to dive in.

They shuffle off in a group to a nearby spot.

They all shuffle back to the previous spot and stand there,

frozen by indecision

CONTINUED:

Suddenly the little dark figure of MUMBLE barrels through the

pack, yelling

For a long moment he's airborne.

Then...he hits the water with a strangled squawk!...and

disappears.

They tentatively crane over the edge. No sign of him. They

peer into the water.

Then...MUMBLE shoots out of the water like a missile...

... as he falls back under water again.

Without hesitation ELLA follows him.

The others follow ELLA. A few at first, then all of them en

masse leap yelling and hollering.

SURFACE/ UNDERWATER

The penguins flounder around, flapping, laughing, and choking

UNDERWATER

Transformed into creatures of grace and exuberance, they

swoop and dive trailing plumes of bubbles.

Over this: the music of THE BEACH BOYS.

Two PENGUINS shoot up through HOLES IN THE ICE...

THE SURFACE

Skidding out of control, they COLLIDE, ending up in a

breathless heap on top of each other.

They scramble to their feet...but the ice is slippery.They

clutch together, slipping and sliding.

Leaning against each other, they manage to stand up, close

now, eyes meeting.

A brief moment then.

CONTINUED:

As others pop up all around

Laughing, she dives into the water. The young males follow

her. MUMBLE hippity-hops to the edge and tumbles in after

her.

UNDERWATER

A half dozen of them gambolling together, their bubble trails

intertwining...

Then everyone freezes as a few silvery FISH swim past.

They all zero in.

Collisions, barging, a bit like water polo when the ball is

first thrown in. In an instant...all the fish are taken.

ON THE SURFACE

MUMBLE surfaces with a fish in his beak

CONTINUED:

Suddenly, A SKUA BIRD swoops down and grabs it.

Mumble hangs on. Neither he not the Skua will let go. The

SKUA soars higher, taking MUMBLE with him.

MUMBLE is carried...higher and higher. The SKUA tries hard to

shake him off, but finally gives up.

He lets go the fish and MUMBLE plummets downwards, landing

Splat! on an ice floe.

ON THE ICE.

Mumble lies still

Ella and the others gather around. MUMBLE still has the FISH

firmly in his beak.

Leaning forward to take the fish

Mumble regains consciousness

CONTINUED:

ELLA leans forward, takes the fish, and daintily gulps it

down.

ON AN ICEBERG. NIGHT

The entire sky is ablaze with the shimmering LIGHTS of the

AURORA AUSTRALIS.

The PENGUINS stand below, looking up in wonder. They sing:

The HARMONIES are exquisite until...

The singing STOPS.

The singing RESUMES.

Another CRESCENDO...

It's too much for MUMBLE.

CONTINUED:

This stops the whole thing dead. ELLA pads over to him.

She returns to the choir. The singing resumes...a perfect

harmonic MUMBLE can't help himself. He begins to TAP DANCE.

AN ICE-FLOE

We find MUMBLE on his own small ice-floe separate from the

others on their iceberg.

As their singing drifts across to him, MUMBLE does an

exquisite little SOFT-SHOE SHUFFLE.

TIME LAPSE

As night slowly pales to a misty dawn and Mumbles lonely

floe drifts off, turning slowly in the current

Music Over: "The tracks of my tears"

MORNING

He is woken by A NUDGE at his little raft of ice.

Another nudge.

CONTINUED:

He looks around - an unfamiliar landscape of ice - then over

the side, seeing nothing but slowly spreading ripples.

A more VIOLENT NUDGE from behind almost makes him lose his

balance. A DARK SHAPE passes swiftly through the water.

The dark shape SHOOTS out of the water. Its GAPING JAWS

missing Mumble by an inch.

As he recoils, slips and tumbles into the WATER.

UNDERWATER/ SURFACE

Choking, thrashing and gulping air, Mumble SCRAMBLES to get

back onto the ice.

The murderous creature comes at him, jaws open, baring rows

of sharp TEETH and MUMBLE swims for his life.

The LEOPARD SEAL is relentless, barging through smaller

floes, powering around larger ones.

Mumble just CAN'T SHAKE HIM OFF. Desperate, he shoots up into

the air, landing on a THIN PANCAKE OF ICE that cannot support

his weight.

Mumble scrambles to gain purchase but FALLS BACK INTO THE

WATER. Now he is ...

UNDER THE ICE SHELF

...caught between the SOLID ICE above him and the bottomless

black WATER below.

CONTINUED:

Mumble POWERS ahead, the ice above growing thicker, the

angled ceiling forcing him down, deeper into the BLACKNESS.

The Leopard Seal opens its mouth. Its GAPING JAWS are about

to engulf Mumble when...

a little SPECK OF LIGHT appears in the ceiling of ice. Mumble

makes a speedy sharp turn, climbing steeply.

He is in a FUNNEL OF ICE...getting narrower and narrower as it

rises to the surface. The Leopard Seal is CLOSING fast.

MUMBLE shoots THROUGH the hole in the ice and into the air...

THE ICE-SHELF

A small group of ADELIE PENGUINS recoil as MUMBLE explodes

out of the hole, closely followed by the LEOPARD SEAL.

WHAM! THUMP! They belly-flop on the ice .

Mumble is quickly on his feet and out of the Leopard Seal's

reach. The ADELIES TAUNT the bulky creature like matadors

The frustrated Leopard Seal snaps and snarls impotently.

Taunting it with a cheeky little TAP DANCE. The Adelies love

it.

CONTINUED:

Bolder now, he does a few neat steps.

They COPY HIM, improvising little riffs on his dance step.

The LEOPARD SEAL inches up behind them.

An Adelie adds an ACROBATIC variation of his own. The LEOPARD

SEAL is almost upon them.

MUMBLE adds a neatly executed slide just as the LEOPARD SEAL

strikes. MUMBLE avoids the lunge and the creature's face

comes down hard on the ice

They fall about laughing. The Leopard Seal returns to the

water.

CONTINUED: (2)

Laughing hysterically at their own jokes they strut off.

MUMBLE watches them go.

MUMBLE looks out at the endless sea of floating ice-pancakes,

all the way to the horizon. Nothing...

He shrugs and hurries off after his new friends.

FURTHER ON

A strange cacophony building as The four ADELIE AMIGOS and

MUMBLE crest the rise, to see...

ADELIE LAND

A vast, boisterous ADELIE PENGUIN COMMUNITY. Thousands of

them, stretching as far as the eye can see. Its very Rio,

very samba, worlds away from the sedate Emperor colony.

Sure enough An ADELIE walks by, a PEBBLE in his beak.

CONTINUED:

One of the Adelies calls to a pair of YOUNG FEMALES he sees

walking by.

The Adelies pose, RUFFLING UP THEIR CRESTS into various

styles: the MOHAWK, the FLAT-TOP...

...trying to top each other, they add HIPPITY-HOPS they've just

learned from Mumble. The females are intrigued.

CONTINUED: (2)

They punch and bump each other playfully.

He touches Mumble and recoils as if burnt

THE CONGA LINE

Music over: Carlos Santana's "Oye Como Va".

The Adelies and Mumble form a conga, weaving in and out of

the nest builders, aiming a kick here and there at their

industrious brethren

UNDERWATER

the Adelies swoop and dive, corralling a FEW SMALL FISH into

a CREVICE.

The fish, darting to and fro are suddenly confronted by

Mumble's OPEN BEAK.

ON THE ICE AGAIN

Mumble shares out the catch

AN ICEBERG

Mumble and the adeles come shooting down a long curving

Slippery dip

As they shoot off the slippery-dip and into the sea mumble

whacks his head on the edge of the ice

UNDERWATER

The Adelies shoot back up to the surface. Mumble sinks,

slightly dazed, watching the kalaeidescope patters of the

surface recede.

Music Over: "Ground Control to major Tom"

ON THE SURFACE

They jump back in to look for him

UNDERWATER

Mumble keeps sinking, down down down into a great cathedral-

like space, lit by eerie shards of underwater light.

Imbedded in the base of the glacier, the rusting remains of,

An OLD YELLOW EXCAVATOR projecting out of the glacier.

It hangs there, inscrutable, like a great yellow totem.

Mumble, dwarfed by it, contemplates it for a while, then

ventures inside, into the body of the BEAST.

INSIDE THE BULLDOZER

A rusting steering column, a perforated dashboard.

He pecks at the metal, trying to taste it, listening to the

sound it makes.

OUTSIDE THE BULLDOZER

In the shimmering space outside the bulldozer, the ADELIES

congregate.

One of them smims closer to the great jaws

Mumble pops his head out from between the jaws

Terrified the Adelies scatter and shoot to the surface like

missiles.

THE ICE SHELF

The Adelies are heading back to their colony as fast as their

little legs will carry then. Mumble Hippity hops after them

The idea is so stunningly original it stops them in their

tracks.

LOVEDAY'S MOUND

MUMBLE and the ADELIE AMIGOS are bunched together, near the

head of a LONG QUEUE of Adelies each with a stone or in their

beak.

At the head of this queue stands LOVEDAY - guardian of a huge

pile of pebbles. His head pokes through one of the rings a

PLASTIC SIX-PACK CAN HOLDER festooned with seaweed like a

HOLY MANTLE.

CONTINUED:

A group of Soul singers, mainly female, sway in the

background, singing a soulful song of adoration as the

Penguin ahead of Mumble steps forward.

The PENGUIN adds his pebble to the pile.

LOVEDAY holds up a flipper for silence and a hush falls over

the gospel choir

Loveday hyperventillates, his eyes roll up in his head

The AMIGOS push MUMBLE forward. He is at least a head taller

than the others.

Mumble places the pebble on the pile. A long Pause

CONTINUED: (2)

In fact Mumble is mesmerised by the luight catching LOVEDAY's

six pack holder. He bends forwards to study it more closely

CONTINUED: (3)

A hush falls over the gathering.

One cue the gospel choir start singing: All you need is Love

The gathering hug awkwardly. Mumble, because of his towering

height, has trouble embracing the Adelie next to him.

CONTINUED: (4)

MUMBLE and the ADELIES are jostled aside in the STAMPEDE of

FEMALES as the gospel group break ranks and mob him

They start posturing for the any FEMALES they can attract

A couple of females look up from the scrum

The Adelies all start DANCING MADLY, but it is too frenetic,

too desperate.

CONTINUED: (5)

Rejected, the Amigos stop dancing.

Ramon is SEARCHING frantically for PEBBLES.

Mumble looks at them. Then opens his beak and demonstrates:

CONTINUED: (6)

Leading off.

THE EMPEROR COLONY

It is autumn, the EMPEROR PENGUINS for the mating season.

It is just like the GREAT GATHERING we saw at the beginning

of our story. Males and females sing their Heartsongs. And

ONE SONG stands out from all the others.

Where NORMA J. once sang, stands ELLA, now sleek and fully

mature. Gathered around her in a semi-circle, a half a dozen

adoring MALES.

Suddenly she becomes aware of a MELLIFLUOUS MALE VOICE

overlapping hers. It has a curious bossa nova rhythm.

Ella turns to see: a PENGUIN backlit by the sun, standing

HEROICALLY on a little rise, just as WISHFUL did.

Ella recognizes those TAPPING FEET. Could this be MUMBLE?She

moves closer to investigate.

CONTINUED:

Ella, suspicious moves to one side. Mumble moves to block her

view. She moves further tound and sees:

Obviously he's been singing while Mumble mimes

She turns and heads off. The Adelie starts after her.

Mumble smacks him with the back of a flipper and goes off

after Ella himself.

She stops. He takes her by the shoulders Shes upset.

CONTINUED: (2)

She walks off.

He TAPS an up-tempo, syncopated rhythm on the ice.

Ella begins to hum Never Can Say Goodbye ironically and

without conviction.

The singing ADELIE joins in...acapella, very rhythmic

Right on cue, the rest of the AMIGOS appear on either side of

him, singing back-up.

CONTINUED: (3)

Curious, ELLA TURNS.

Framed between the Adelies, Mumble strikes a pose, holds it

for a moment... then lets rip.

He TAP DANCES...UNINHIBITED, WILD, JOYOUS. The ADELIES

accompany him. They know all the moves and it is INFECTIOUS

FEET are beginning to tap, couples are beginning to

improvise... singing along, trying out the dance steps.

Now ELLA is caught up in it. AND MUMBLE IS DANCING LIKE NO

PENGUIN HAS EVER DONE BEFORE!

ELLA is ecstatic. Just when we think the WHOLE COLONY will be

swept up into the abandon. A DARK FIGURE steps forward

ELLA STOPS DANCING. MUMBLE misses a beat, loses his footing,

trips and goes sliding across the ice to the feet of CARUSO

and the ELDERS.

The ADELIES shuffle uncomfortably. Caruso turns to the rest

of the emperors

CONTINUED: (4)

He BATS the ADELIES aside like skittles. Mumble intervenes

CONTINUED: (5)

Wishful emerges from the crowd

MUMBLE walks away. The community part to let him go. Ella

chases after him.

Catching up with him

He stops.

CONTINUED: (6)

The Adelies give them space

Ella returns to the community. As she does so, CARUSO begins

to CHANT the Gathering answers.

CONTINUED: (7)

ELLAS watches through tears as the tiny figures of Mumble and

the Adelies dwindle to specks and disappear into the mist.

THE ICE SHELF

Mumble and the Adelies have put the colony far behind,

trekking homewards

ADELIELAND

Most of the Adelies are sitting on nests. The Adeleies and

Mumble trek past them a protective mother takes a peck at

them.

CONTINUED:

They find LOVEDAY at the back of what is left of his PEBBLE

PILE. He sits leaning against it...exhausted.

MUMBLE kicks a bunch of pebbles at him.

LOVEDAY tries to raise himself up. A tight low gurgling

rumbles from his throat.

LOVEDAY gurgles and points wildly to the SIX-PACK PLASTIC

round his neck.

LOVEDAY coughs. His eyes bulge.

They tug at the SIX-PACK PLASTIC. LOVEDAY GASPS AND WINCES.

The Adelies back off.

CONTINUED: (2)

LOVEDAY gives a little `so-so' gesture with his flipper.

LOVEDAY shakes his head sadly.

LOVEDAY mimes swimming.

LOVEDAY mimes the talisman going over his head.

LOVEDAY shakes his head, `no'. He stretches his neck.

CONTINUED: (3)

LOVEDAY hangs his head. A TEAR slides down his beak.

Beaten, LOVEDAY shakes his head `No' The Adelies are stunned

into silence.

LOVEDAY looks up, a glimmer of hope in his eye.

Loveday Then he makes a strange "Oi, Oi, Oi" sound.

LOVEDAY nods and points towards the mountains.

LOVEDAY shakes his head.

LOVEDAY nods.

LOVEDAY gestures wildly with his flippers!

CONTINUED: (4)

LOVEDAY nods `YES!!' and falls back in exhaustion.

A MOUNTAIN RIDGE

The Adelies labour uphill into the wind. LOVEDAY is lagging

behind, breathing hard.

Even MUMBLE and the AMIGOS are puffing with the effort of the

climb.

Music Over: He aint heavy he's my brother.

Then on the wind comes a fiant `Oi, Oi, Oi'.

As they crest the peak, sure enough, down below: the LAND of

the ELEPHANT SEALS. Thousands of them.

Not waiting, Mumble launches himself over the other side,

slip-sliding down the mountain. One by one the ADELIES

follow.

THE LAND OF THE ELEPHANT SEALS

The beach is literally heaving.

MUMBLE and the ADELIES come tumbling and sliding right up to

two HUGE SEALS.

CONTINUED:

The Adelies bunch up behind Mumble

The Good Ole Boys are into ONE-UPMANSHIP.

He indicates the SIX-PACK PLASTIC around LOVEDAY'S neck.

SEAL 1 lowers it's massive head down to face LOVEDAY.

Wheezing he examines the plastic with first with one eye,

then the other, before announcing his verdict.

CONTINUED: (2)

They start fighting, lunging and flopping on each other

CONTINUED: (3)

MUMBLE and LOVEDAY keep trekking.

And reluctantly, he trails after them. As do...

THE BLIZZARD COUNTRY

MUMBLE, LOVEDAY and the ADELIES are tiny specks, struggling

over a series of great ridges.

A SNOW STORM breakes over them. A screaming wind brings total

WHITE-OUT. The Penguins have to shout to make themselves

heard.

CONTINUED:

He turns his back to the wind. Immediately the Adelies form a

STRAIGHT LINE down-wind from him.

They form a little huddle, but as soon as Mumble moves from

the upwind position, the Adelies complain.

They scurry back into a straight line behind Mumble who cops

the FULL BLAST of the GALE.

He gives up and marches off into the driving snow.

The others lie down, propelling themselves forwards on their

fronts

CONTINUED: (2)

FLARE OUT TO WHITE

The blizzard has passed. An eerie stillness.

One by one the Adelies get to their feet and waddle forwards

to where Mumble and Loveday stand, gazing into the distance.

They have finally reached the sea again

LOVEDAY chokes out a `yes'.

Close to the waters edge, the outline of several buildings

AN ABANDONED WHALING STATION

The PENGUINS venture through it, dwarfed by the old flensing-

sheds, the chimneys and boiling-vats. Its all now abandoned,

and half concealed by snow.

Around and above them, there are HOOKS, CHAINS, rusting

twisted METALWORK.

An ominous GROANING as some rusting metal plate moves in the

wind.

LOVEDAY is looking at something at his feet.

CONTINUED:

There, imbedded in the ice: another six pack holder.

THE SEA ICE

Mumble and the Adelies venture out onto the weak ice beyond

the whaling station, finding more and more of the strange

artefacts: a piece of nylon rope, a soda can, a boot.

FURTHER ON

They've reached the edge of the sea-ice. LOVEDAY croaks a

warning. He points out to sea.

A WAVE has appeared on the glassy surface of the sea. It is

coming towards them, FAST like the bow wave of an IMMENSE

UNDERWATER CREATURE.

The wave is coming CLOSER.

A massive BLACK DORSAL FIN breaks the surface.

The PENGUINS are off and running...

CONTINUED:

The DORSAL FIN keeps coming like the blade of a demonic

carving knife.

Then the monstrous fin disappears and KABOOM! The killer

whale breaches the ice AHEAD of them, cutting off their

retreat.

They are left stranded on a free-floating ICE FLOE

The little floe is wobbling crazily

The KILLER WHALE breaches again, rising like a tower block

out of the ocean.

The ICE PAD flips, flinging them into the water like a

handful of peanuts.

IN THE SEA

The PENGUINS head for shore , swimming for their lives.

LOVEDAY, thrashing and wheezing, is unable to keep up.

He swims back. The KILLER WHALE is about to take them both in

one bite. MUMBLE pulls LOVEDAY aside, but he's not quite

quick enough: one of the Whale's outer teeth catches LOVEDAY

by the SIX-PACK PLASTIC and he is DRAGGED AWAY, tethered to

the KILLER WHALE like Captain Ahab.

The WHALE thrashes around wildly trying to dislodge the

hapless little penguin until...

CONTINUED:

LOVEDAY is FLUNG high, high into the air and...SPLASHES DOWN

some distance away.

The KILLER WHALE is left with the SIX-PACK PLASTIC lodged in

its teeth.

ICE SHELF

MUMBLE and LOVEDAY scramble onto the ice exhausted.

Wondering where the next attack will come from, the AMIGOS

huddle nearby.

Suddenly the ICE SHELF CRACKS OPEN and the KILLER WHALE soars

right over the top of them

It hits the water but does not stop, just keeps going right

on out to sea. The Penguins have no time to reflect on their

good fortune.

Theres an EARTH SHATTERING NOISE behind them . Turning they

see a vast BLACK SHAPE, a hundred feet high, coming at them

through the fog.

The ADELIES flee across the ice. MUMBLE stands transfixed by

the BIG BLACK SHIP towering above him. On the deck he sees

HUMAN FIGURES...

The pack-ice is BUCKLING AND EXPLODING ahead of the GREAT

JUGGERNAUT.

From a safe distance the ADELIES stop and look on in

amazement as Mumble stands his ground, shouting up at THE

SHIP as it advances towards him.

The ICE beneath his feet OPENS UP, Mumble topples into the

gap and The SHIP PASSES OVER HIM, huge propellers churning,

leaving a channel ninety feet wide.

MUMBLE resurfaces.

CONTINUED:

He chases after the ship. THE ADELIES chase after Mumble...

Already the ship is half a mile away.

THE ICEBERG

Beyond the last of the ice floes is THE WORLD'S TALLEST

ICEBERG. MUMBLE hurls himself onto it and starts scrambling

up its precipitous sides. THE ADELIES follow, struggling to

keep up.

THE SUMMIT

MUMBLE's POV: THE BIG BLACK SHIP has joined TWO OTHERS about

a mile away. The Adelies join him.

Mumble's     eyes remain fixed on the horizon.

CONTINUED:

Mumble turns, takes a few paces back.

Suddenly, MUMBLE turns to the precipice and runs as fast as

he can...

As he launches himself into space...

WIDE SHOT

The tiny penguin soaring off the top of the ICEBERG.

THE ADELIES rush to the edge as, far below Mumble HITS THE

WATER. And vanishes.

Far out he has surfaced and is swimming strongly in direction

of the BIG BLACK SHIP.

CONTINUED:

Loveday follows behind

THE OPEN SEA

MUMBLE PLOUGHS THROUGH a rolling sea: towering waves block

everything from view but on the crests he catches sight of...

THREE BLACK SHIPS, far ahead, but stationary, as if waiting

for him.

LATER

He's getting closer. The ships are only half a mile away when

Something rises from the deep, threatening to engulf him: a

HUGE NET, TEEMING WITH FISH.

Mumble shoots out of the way, just avoiding being caught as.

UP AHEAD The great NET FULL OF FISH breaks the surface of the

water and is winched on board.

As if in response the ship's ENGINES START UP again and the

sea around him erupts in churning foam.

Swamped by the wake, Mumble goes under. When he resurfaces,

THE SHIP is already on its way.

CONTINUED:

He takes a deep breath and resumes his pursuit.

OPEN OCEAN

The SEAS are MOUNTAINOUS. There is no sign of the ship now,

nor of land.

MUMBLE swims up the side of each wave, over its foaming crest

and down into the deep dark valley below.

LATER

The air is full of spray. Choking, MUMBLE ducks under the

water.

UNDERWATER

Its peaceful here. Then something moves beside him and turns

with a start to see: A MASSIVE EYE!!

A BLUE WHALE entirely fills his field of vision. It sings a

few booming Wagnerian notes. Its voice is almost deafening.

He surfaces, spluttering.

A VOICE calls to him from above. Mumble looks up. An

ALBATROSS hovers overhead.

From the ALBATROSS' aerial view, Mumble looks tiny next to

the MASSIVE BULK of the Blue Whale.

CONTINUED:

CONTINUED: (2)

The Blue Whale responds with a long mournful "NO-O-O-O" which

the Albatross does not need to translate.

Mumble hesitates, bobbing on the water, weighing the

warnings.

He makes up his mind and strikes out again swimming towards

the convergence.

The Albatross, hovering on the wing, watches.

The ALBATROSS wheels away.

As MUMBLE fights on through the huge choppy waves, the

Whale's Wagnerian song booms out, EERIE and FORLORN.

THE CONVERGENCE

We see from above, the BLUE WHALE turning as well, changing

course to avoid a change in the texture and colour of the

water stretching in a line, as far as the eye can see. MUMBLE

swims RIGHT ACROSS THE LINE.

A VAST OCEAN

MUMBLE is a mere DOT now as the GREAT CURRENTS capture him

and sweep him away.

We pull back through the clouds until the very CURVATURE OF

THE EARTH is visible: a blue horizon with no land in sight.

SMALL POLLUTED BEACH

On the HIGH-WATER MARK, amongst the rubbish and the oil

slick, we see what looks like a dead animal. It is MUMBLE.

A creature in RED GUMBOOTS approaches. Its small hand reaches

down and nudges him with a stick. MUMBLE moans and the

gumboots RUN AWAY, shouting something unintelligible.

With great difficulty, Mumble raises his head to try to see

more. Sunlight flares, bleaching to white, as he LOSES

CONSCIOUSNESS.

A WHITE ROOM

Scientific books and specimens of birds in large bottles on

shelves line the walls.

MUMBLE, eyes closed, is lying on a stainless steel table. He

opens his eyes to the brilliant glare of an examination lamp.

There is movement around him. Voices whispering in an alien

tongue. A FIGURE IN WHITE bends over him cleaning the oil

from his feathers with detergent. MUMBLE squawks.

A very pretty FEMALE SCIENTIST is smiling down at him.

But all the SCIENTIST sees is a squawking penguin.

The SCIENTIST produces a syringe and squirts some of it's

contents in the air.

Another SCIENTIST holds him still while the needle is

administered.

Drowsy now, he is eased into a PADDED CAGE. The SCIENTISTS

close the lid, and secure it with straps.

IN THE CARGO HOLD

We hear a feeble thumping from inside.

CONTINUED:

Pull back to reveal Mumble's box on a shelf among crates and

luggage. Fade in engine noise over as....

ENDLESS SKY

A 747 drones across the screen, eastwards into the night.

DARKNESS

Like the light at the end of a tunnel. As if in a dream,

MUMBLE ambles towards it. Emerging into

PENGUIN HEAVEN

Bright BLUE SKY, sparkling WHITE CLIFFS OF ICE.

His voice ECHOES back at him, with a mocking edge. There is

something unusual about this place. A plump penguin waddles

by

Mumble is looking around, trying to figure it out

CONTINUED:

A fish hits him on the head.

A moment later he's knocked flat by a sudden rush of

PENGUINS: Chinstraps, Rock-hoppers, Adelies, King penguins,

emerging from holes in the rock face

Lying on his back he sees fish tumble from the sky. It's

RAINING FISH!

His POV, Load after load of fish tumbling out of a clear sky

UNDERWATER

Fish hit the surface and sink

Mumble pursues one of them.

He swims SLAP BANG into a sheet of thick glass. ALIEN FACES

are pressed against it. Mumble yells and shoots to the

surface.

THE PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

High up he sees the viewing gallery. A great CROWD of ALIENS

staring and chattering

Mumble backs away and knocks into the PAINTED HORIZON. He

puts out a wing to steady himself and notices a metal tag on

it. This place is beginning to upset him.

CONTINUED:

The other penguins stand around, immobile, chomping fish.

THE PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

Caption: A year later

Specators POV: Mumble stands around, like the others,

ignoring the aliens, chomping fish

His POV: Day after day, the view constantly the same, except

for the groupings of spectators high in the viewing Gallery

CU Mumble: A camera flashes. A fish hits him, he doesn't

flinch

THE SAME/ PASSAGE OF TIME

Another day and another. Night follows day follows night.

Spectators come and go. The penguins stand like statues.

Though bubbles begin to appear above Mumbles head, snapshots

of his past experiences

In the though bubble, Ella has appeared singing never can say

goodbye. Mumbles feet begin shuffling to the rythm

SPECTATORS GALLERY

Most of the specators are leaving but one young girls stops

and stares

She bangs on the glass in her excitement.

PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

Mumble, woken from his reverie, looks up and sees her looking

at him.

The little girl who is pointing at mumbles feet. Mumble looks

down, realizes what his feet are doing, looks up again.

He does a more elaborate step. The Mother shouts in

disbelief. Various other specators come back and join her.

Mumbles fellow captives are unimpressed.

They shuffle away

IN THE SPECTATORS GALLERY.

The aliens, in contrast, are loving it. Already a crowd has

gathered, laughing and clapping.

NEXT DAY

The Gallery is packed. Mumble keeps dancing

NEXT DAY

Theres a riot going on up there. People fighting to get a

view. Newspaper reporters, TV cameras.

The other penguins in the enclosure have moved back, giving

Mumble more space. Every specattor is focussed on him. Mumble

is focussed on the spectators.

THE TRANSPORTER BOX

A squawking Mumble is thrust inside and the lid slams shut on

him. Kerchunk.

THE EMPEROR COLONY

Silence, then across the vast expanse a TINY FIGURE appears

on the horizon.

A couple of Penguins watch the approaching figure.

LATER

Mumble approaches the two sentries. The colony is much

diminished: only small groups scattered here and there.

CONTINUED:

Other penguins are gathering to scrutinise the stranger.

Then a female penguin bursts out of the crowd.

As he speaks, his eyes are drawn to the huge number of FLUFFY

CHICKS following behind her

CONTINUED: (2)

They listen. Above the wind   faint electronic BEEPING SOUND.

CARUSO bursts through the crowd.

The BEEP is quite audible now - a little faster and louder.

Curious, Ella ambles round behind mumble tro see what's

making the noise

She turns him around to reveal some kind of circuit board

glued to his back: a small aerial, winking red lights. A

TRANSMITTER.

A gasp of fear and astonishment from the penguins. Caruso is

momentarily speechless.

CONTINUED: (3)

A distant rumbling, like some monstrous cataclysm is

approaching

He starts tap dancing. The penguins are torn, between

Caruso's instructions and Mumbles.

A few adventurous souls begin to copy him, out of fear if

nothing else.

As they do so, the sky begins to darken. A strange whirling

wind starts whipping the snow around them. The very earth

seems to be shaking under them.

Wishful rounds on them angrily.

They start dancing.

CONTINUED: (4)

Caruso has climbed a small hillock and is ranting like an old

testament prophet

Mumble and Ella are dancing through the community

The tide is beginning to turn in his favour

As he shouts his he is blown off his feet by a tremendous

gust of wind

Caruso tumbles head over heels as a massive Chinook

helicopter rises over the hirizon, its massive rotors mashing

the air.

It swoops down over the penguin nation and lands a little

distance away.

Music Over: Wanna Dance with Somebody.

CONTINUED: (5)

Now the entire emperor community are dancing for all they are

worth.

Mrs Astrakhan dances past

Wishful dances over to her, his eyes on Mumble and Ella

BY THE CHINOOK

HUMAN scientists disembark. Skidoos are kicked into life.

We TRAVEL WITH THE SKIDOOS across the ICE-SHELF to the colony

Scientists POV: As they stop, lower their hoods and gaze in

astonishment. One of them lifts a video cam to record

THOUSANDS OF EMPEROR PENGUIN DANCING WITH PURE, ABANDONED

JOY.

A CONFERENCE ROOM

Suited figures are seated round a large table, watching as

IMAGES of the DANCING PENGUIN COLONY play on a video screen.

Without the music it's less obviously a dance.

CONTINUED:

THE COLONY

In the confusion of penguins we find MUMBLE, ELLA and their

chick

As we watch, Ella moves off, joining the great to and fro of

penguins along the highway to the sea.

CONTINUED:

MUMBLE covers his chick protectively, watrching his wife walk

away.

We are pulling back now, back from the colony, back from

Antarctica.

SPACE

Still pulling back

Keep pulling back from the world, the solar system,       the

galaxy.

Further back. Our galaxy is framed in something like a bomb-

sight.

IN THE DOME

We`re somewhere otherworldly, inside a clear dome the size of

a stadium, with a view of the heavens. In the centre of this

space, always just out of shot, two illdefined figures are

talking, subtitled:

Projected somehow in mid-air A 3-D image of Times square in

winter with tiny people milling around in black coats

CONTINUED:

An image of the dancing penguins appears.

The shadowy figure laughs, enjoying the image.

The bomb sight moves away from our galaxy to another part of

the universe

With that the two figures head off across the great shadowy

interior.

The projector beam catches them, briefly, throwing up the

giant shadows of these aliens They look very like huge

penguins.

As they walking solemnly out of shot with their hands behind

their backs one of them breaks step to do a little jig.

RUN TITLES

THE END
