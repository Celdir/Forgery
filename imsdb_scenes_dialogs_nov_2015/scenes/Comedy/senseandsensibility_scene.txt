EXT. OPEN ROADS - NIGHT - TITLE SEQUENCE

A series of traveling shots. A well-dressed, pompous-looking

individual (JOHN DASHWOOD, 35) is making an urgent journey

on horseback. He looks anxious.

EXT. NORLAND PARK - ENGLAND - MARCH 1800 - NIGHT

Silence. Norland Park, a large country house built in the

early part of the eighteenth century, lies in the moonlit

parkland.

INT. NORLAND PARK - MR DASHWOOD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the dim light shed by candles we see a bed in which a MAN

(MR DASHWOOD, 52) lies his skin waxy, his breathing laboured.

Around him two silhouettes move and murmur, their clothing

susurrating in the deathly hush. DOCTORS. A WOMAN (MRS

DASHWOOD, 50) sits by his side, holding his hand, her eyes

never leaving his face.

MR DASHWOOD looks anguished.

They smile at each other. MRS DASHWOOD is just managing to

conceal her fear and grief

MRS DASHWOOD tries to laugh but it emerges as a sob. An older

MANSERVANT (THOMAS) now enters, anxiety written on every

feature.

MR DASHWOOD squeezes his wife's hand.

She nods quickly and he smiles at her with infinite

tenderness.

MRS DASHWOOD makes a superhuman effort and smiles back. She

allows THOMAS to help her out. She passes JOHN DASHWOOD as

he enters, presses his hand, but cannot speak. JOHN takes

her place by the bed.

MR DASHWOOD summons his last ounces of energy and starts to

whisper with desperate intensity.

JOHN blinks. He cannot quite take it in.

But MR DASHWOOD continues with even greater determination.

JOHN looks torn between genuine distress and unexpected

delight.

JOHN's face is a picture of conflicting emotions. Behind

them is the ominous rustling of parchments.

A brief moment of sincerity overcomes JOHN's natural

hypocrisy.

MR DASHWOOD seems relieved. Suddenly his breathing changes.

JOHN looks alarmed. He rises and we hear him going to find

the DOCTOR.

But it is we who share the dying man's last words.

EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Outside the house sits a very well-to-do carriage. Behind it

waits another open carriage upon which servants are laying

trunks and boxes.

INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY

JOHN is standing in mourning clothes and a traveling cape.

He is watching, and obviously waiting for, a pert WOMAN (FANNY

DASHWOOD) who is standing by a mirror looking at him keenly.

FANNY goes very still. JOHN gets nervous.

FANNY slowly turns back to the mirror.

A pause as FANNY turns and looks at him again.

INT. LAUNDRY - NORLAND PARK - DAY

A red-eyed MAID (BETSY) plunges a beautiful muslin frock

into a vat of black dye.

INT. NORLAND PARK - MRS DASHWOOD'S BEDROOM - DAY

MRS DASHWOOD is rushing about, mourning ribbons flapping,

putting her knick-knacks into a small valise. The room is in

chaos. A young WOMAN (ELINOR DASHWOOD) looks on helplessly.

She suddenly collapses into a chair and bursts into tears.

INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S CARRIAGE - DAY

JOHN and FANNY are on their way out of London.

INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

A beautiful young WOMAN (MARIANNE DASHWOOD) is sitting at

the piano playing a particularly sad piece. ELINOR enters.

MARIANNE stops, turns the pages of her music book and starts

playing something equally lugubrious.

EXT. ROADSIDE INN - DAY

JOHN and FANNY are waiting as the OSTLERS make the final

adjustments to their carriage. The LANDLORD hovers, waiting

for a tip.

He displays some coins in his hand. FANNY removes one and

nods.

JOHN gives the coins to the LANDLORD.

EXT. NORLAND PARK - MARGARET'S TREE-HOUSE - DAY

ELINOR comes to the foot of a large tree from which a small

staircase issues.

A pause. ELINOR is about to leave when a disembodied and

truculent young voice stops her.

Silence. ELINOR tries another tack.

CLOSE on ELINOR as she ponders the truth of this statement.

INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S CARRIAGE - DAY

JOHN and FANNY joggle on.

INT. NORLAND PARK - SERVANTS' HALL - DAY

The large contingent of SERVANTS who staff Norland Park are

gathered in gloomy silence as ELINOR addresses them.

CAM holds on THOMAS and BETSY, a capable woman.

EXT. NORLAND PARK. DRIVE - DAY

JOHN and FANNY's carriage approaches Norland.

INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S CARRIAGE - DAY

JOHN and FANNY are about to get out.

INT. NORLAND PARK - DINING ROOM - EARLY EVE

The entire family, with the exception of MARGARET, is present.

BETSY is serving food in an atmosphere of stiff silence.

Cutlery clinks. JOHN chews loudly. MARIANNE is rigid with

resentment. MRS DASHWOOD maintains a cool, removed dignity.

ELINOR tries to play hostess.

In the brief silence which follows this, FANNY surreptitiously

checks the hallmark on her butterknife.

MRS DASHWOOD looks at ELINOR pointedly. JOHN notices.

FANNY looks about, barely able to conceal her satisfaction.

INT. NORLAND PARK - ELINOR'S BEDROOM - DAY

ELINOR is sitting with a little pile of parcels. She puts a

shawl into some paper and ties it with ribbon as MARIANNE

thunders in, looking mutinous.

INT. NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY

FANNY, MRS DASHWOOD, ELINOR and JOHN are at breakfast.

MARIANNE enters. ELINOR catches her eye and indicates FANNY

with a slight motion of her head. MARIANNE makes a face.

FANNY is rather startled.

ELINOR is relieved.

ELINOR rushes in before MARIANNE gets any further.

MARIANNE slams her cup down and throws a furious look at

ELINOR.

INT. NORLAND PARK - MARGARET'S BEDROOM - DAY

ELINOR and MARIANNE are removing MARGARET's toys.

EXT. NORLAND PARK - DRIVE - DAY

A very capable HORSEMAN (EDWARD FERRARS) canters up the gravel

drive.

CLOSE on his face as he gazes up at the elegant facade.

INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

Everyone except MARGARET is present. EDWARD has just shaken

bands with ELINOR. He behaves with great respect to the

DASHWOODS and seems embarrassed by FANNY's pro prietorial

air.

ELINOR glances at her warningly but EDWARD replies with

careful consideration.

MARIANNE and ELINOR look at each other in surprise. FANNY

looks furious.

MRS DASHWOOD smiles warmly at EDWARD.

CLOSE on ELINOR. She is impressed.

INT. NORLAND PARK - STAIRCASE - DAY

FANNY is walking with EDWARD, who looks at the pictures with

interest.

INT. NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAY

FANNY leads EDWARD in. She sniffs with distaste.

As they speak, EDWARD notices a large atlas retreating

apparently all by itself across the floor. Someone is

obviously under the table, pulling it out of sight. He

registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield

it from FANNY. He turns back, searching for something to

divert her.

There is a stifled wail from under the table, which EDWARD

covers with a cough.

And he ushers FANNY out, flicking a quick glance over his

shoulder at the fugitive's foot.

INT. NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - DAY

ELINOR, MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE are sitting round a table

with a pile of letters. ELINOR is handing one back to her

mother.

ELINOR reads the letter quickly.

There is a knock on the door. Hesitantly, EDWARD appears.

MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are puzzled by his elliptical manner

but ELINOR immediately understands and rises, in smiling

relief.

INT. NORLAND PARK - ENTRANCE HALL OUTSIDE LIBRARY - DAY

EDWARD is standing outside keeping a discreet lookout. The

door is half open and he can hear ELINOR trying to coax

MARGARET out. FANNY walks by with a BUTLER to whom she is

giving instructions. EDWARD pretends to examine the mouldings

and she passes on unsuspecting.

More silence. EDWARD thinks hard. He makes a decision.

INT. NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAY

EDWARD walks in loudly.

ELINOR looks up at him in astonishment.

EDWARD appears to be utterly sincere.

From under the table we hear a snort. ELINOR looks at him in

realisation.

They are having such a good time that it is rather a pity

the game is stopped by the appearance from under the table

of MARGARET who reveals herself to be a disheveled girl of

eleven. She hauls the atlas up and plonks it in front of

EDWARD.

EDWARD shakes MARGARET's hand solemnly and looks over her

head at ELINOR. They smile at each other, a connection made.

INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

JOHN is reading a newspaper. MRS DASHWOOD sits across from

FANNY, who thumbs through a fashion-plate magazine. ELINOR

is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the words

'of course we should like to leave as soon as possible'.

Suddenly she hears a commotion outside. MARGARET runs past

the window brandishing a stick. EDWARD follows, and proceeds

to teach her the first principles of sword-fighting. They

feint and parry, EDWARD serious and without a hint of

condescension, MARGARET concentrating furiously. EDWARD

suddenly turns, as though feeling ELINOR's gaze. She smiles

but looks away quickly.

INT. NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

EDWARD comes into the doorway and sees ELINOR who is listening

to MARIANNE playing a concerto. ELINOR stands in a graceful,

rather sad attitude, her back to us. Suddenly she senses

EDWARD behind her and turns. He is about to turn away,

embarrassed to have been caught admiring her, when he sees

she has been weeping. Hastily she tries to dry her eyes. He

comes forward and offers her a handkerchief, which she takes

with a grateful smile. We notice his monogram in the corner:

ECF.

EDWARD nods kindly.

They start to walk out of shot, still talking.

CAM tilts up to find MRS DASHWOOD on the middle landing of

the staircase, smiling down at them. CAM tilts up yet further

to find FANNY on the landing above, watching EDWARD and ELINOR

with a face like a prune.

EXT. NORLAND PARK - GARDENS - DAY

EDWARD and ELINOR are still talking as they walk arm in arm

in the late afternoon sun.

His tone is light but there is an underlying bitterness to

it.

EXT. FIELDS NEAR NORLAND - DAY

EDWARD and ELINOR are on horseback. The atmosphere is

intimate, the quality of the conversation rooted now in their

affections.

EDWARD nods and smiles at the irony of it.

He looks at her slightly shocked but enjoying her boldness.

They ride on in silence for a moment.

INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE

Dinner is over. JOHN and FANNY are examining plans of the

Norland estate, looking for somewhere to build a hermitage.

EDWARD is reading out loud. ELINOR embroiders and listens.

MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE make up the rest of the audience,

the latter in a state of high impatience.

MARIANNE jumps up and goes to him.

She takes the book from him and reads the stanza with

passionate brio.

Rather mortified, EDWARD starts again, but not before

receiving a sympathetic look from ELINOR which seems to

comfort him a little.

INT. NORLAND PARK - MORNING ROOM - DAY

MRS DASHWOOD is ruminating sadly. MARIANNE rushes in holding

a letter.

MRS DASHWOOD looks at the letter again and thinks.

Marianne nods, a little reluctantly.

MRS DASHWOOD makes her decision. She takes the letter and

hides it in the pocket of her gown. MARIANNE looks on

frowningly.

MARIANNE thinks for a little.

INT. NORLAND PARK - ELINOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ELINOR is in bed, deep in thought. MARIANNE enters in her

nightclothes, carrying a book of poetry. She reads, teasingly.

She jumps onto the bed. ELINOR smiles somewhat suspiciously.

ELINOR is greatly taken aback and does not know how to reply.

Suddenly MARIANNE hugs her passionately.

MARIANNE pulls away, her eyes full of tears.

ELINOR trails off. MARIANNE looks at her keenly.

The bold clarity of this question discomforts ELINOR.

This makes ELINOR laugh in spite of her discomfort.

MARIANNE is flummoxed but she rallies swiftly and picks up

her book again.

ELINOR blushes in good earnest. MARIANNE goes to the door.

And she is gone, leaving ELINOR both agitated and amused.

INT. NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY

FANNY is standing by the window looking out. We see her POV

of ELINOR and EDWARD walking in the garden.

MRS DASHWOOD enters, pauses for a moment and then joins FANNY

at the window. FANNY pretends not to have been watching but

MRS DASHWOOD looks down at the lovers and then smiles sweetly

at her.

FANNY does a bit of quick thinking.

FANNY lowers her voice confidingly.

It is impossible for MRS DASHWOOD not to get the point. She

is appalled and furious.

She sweeps off.

INT. NORLAND PARK - MRS DASHWOOD'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

MRS DASHWOOD, breathless with rage, is searching through her

wardrobe for the gown which contains SIR JOHN's letter. Frocks

fly hither and thither. Finally MRS DASHWOOD plunges her

hand into the right pocket and withdraws the letter. She

looks at it, suddenly concerned and anxious.

INT. NORLAND PARK - DINING ROOM - EVE

The entire family is present. Everyone is watching MRS

DASHWOOD, who has just made her announcement.

He is devastated. FANNY is thrilled. MRS DASHWOOD looks at

him with compassion and then at ELINOR, who is trying to

keep calm.

MRS DASHWOOD ignores FANNY.

INT/EXT. NORLAND PARK - STABLES - DAY

ELINOR has come to say goodbye to her HORSE. She strokes the

soft face sadly. Then she senses someone and turns to find

EDWARD standing nearby.

ELINOR tries to smile. EDWARD looks at her for a long moment

and then comes closer.

The use of her Christian name--and in such a loving tone--

stops ELINOR's breath altogether.

He comes closer still. The HORSE breathes between them. ELINOR

is on fire with anticipation but EDWARD looks troubled and

has less the air of a suitor than he might.

EDWARD laughs nervously. ELINOR is completely bewildered.

ELINOR is beginning to feel like a parrot.

As EDWARD flounders, a familiar voice cuts through this

unexpected foray into his academic past.

They turn to find FANNY powering down upon them, waving a

letter. EDWARD steps back, glancing almost guiltily at ELINOR,

who is as confused as we are.

FANNY is determined. She obviously has no intention of leaving

him alone with ELINOR. EDWARD turns to ELINOR, frustration

in every muscle, his jaw set tight.

FANNY drags EDWARD off, leaving ELINOR to gaze sadly after

them.

INT. THE LADIES' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - RAIN - EVE

The DASHWOODS are on their way. The mood is very sombre.

MARIANNE looks at ELINOR, pleased.

MRS DASHWOOD looks at ELINOR with satisfaction.

EXT. THE LADIES' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - EVE

The carriage rolls on.

EXT. ROAD TO AND FROM BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

In comparison to Norland, Barton Cottage has the air of a

damp shoebox. it sits low and bleak in the grey lonely

countryside.

From one side we can see the DASHWOODS' carriage drawing up

at the gate. From the other, a much grander vehicle, from

which loud whooping can be heard, is approaching.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY

As the exhausted DASHWOODS alight, they converge with a ruddy-

complexioned MAN in a redingote (SIR JOHN MIDDLETON) and a

rotund, equally roseate LADY (MRS JENNINGS) who have fallen

over each other in their haste to get out of their carriage.

SIR JOHN clasps her hands and starts to help her up the path,

followed by ELINOR, MARIANNE and MARGARET, who is clearly

fascinated by his bouncy companion.

SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS talk incessantly, interrupt each

other all the time and never listen.

They reach the front door and BETSY's smiling welcome. In

the confusion of milling people and THOMAS carrying the

lighter luggage, MARIANNE contrives to slip into the house

alone. We follow her but hear the conversation continuing in

V.O. MARIANNE looks about the parlour, where a dismal fire

is smoking. She starts up the stairs, expressionless.

MARIANNE enters a small bedroom. She sits on the bed. Then

she goes to the window and opens it. Voices float up.

MARIANNE closes the window and crosses the corridor to another

bed room--similarly stark. She sighs and turns back down the

stairs.

MARIANNE joins the group, who are now in the parlour.

The strain of exhibiting joy and gratitude is beginning to

tell on MRS DASHWOOD who is sagging visibly.

SIR JOHN is dragging her down the path.

Now he is pushing her into the carriage.

They take off, waving wildly. MARGARET goes down the path to

watch them and turns back to her slightly stunned family.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MARIANNE and ELINOR are getting undressed for bed. it's very

cold. They keep their underclothing on and get in, shivering

at the bony chill of the linen.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY

BETSY is pinning out laundry.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY

MARGARET tries to climb an impossible tree. Her petticoats

snag and tear.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

MARIANNE looks out of the window at the wild countryside.

Uncon sciously, one hand plays up and down on the sill as

though it were a keyboard.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

ELINOR sits at a little desk counting money and making notes.

BETSY enters to clean out the fire. She notices the money.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - EVE

CLOSE on MRS DASHWOOD looking out of the window, thinking.

She remembers MRS JENNINGS's words:

MRS DASHWOOD turns into the room to look at her brood. ELINOR

and MARIANNE are mending MARGARET's petticoats. CLOSE on the

mother's anxious expression--what is to become of them?

EXT. BARTON PARK - EVE

Establishing shot of SIR JOHN's house--a very comfortable-

looking country seat with fine grounds.

INT. BARTON PARK - DINING ROOM - EVE

CLOSE on an empty chair and place setting. Pull out to reveal

the DASHWOODS at their first dinner with SIR JOHN and MRS

JENNINGS.

MARIANNE flashes an unmistakable glance of alarmed concern

at her sister, which MRS JENNINGS notices.

They both laugh immoderately. ELINOR tries to stay calm.

ELINOR tries to smile. MARIANNE looks furious. MARGARET is

staring at MRS JENNINGS as if she were some particularly

thrilling form of wildlife.

ELINOR starts to change the subject, but MARGARET interrupts

her.

SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS turn on her with screams of delight.

ELINOR, MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD look at each other

helplessly.

ELINOR looks hard at her plate.

MRS DASHWOOD is appalled at her youngest's relish for such a

vulgar game. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are cock-a-hoop.

MARIANNE suddenly stands up. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are

so surprised they stop talking. Everyone stares at MARIANNE.

For once, ELINOR is grateful for her sister's rudeness as

everyone rises and follows MARIANNE out.

EXT. BARTON PARK - FRONT STEPS - EVE

A soldierly MAN of about forty (COLONEL BRANDON) is

dismounting from his horse. From within we hear MARIANNE's

song begin. His head snaps up to the windows. An expression

of pained surprise comes into his melancholy, brooding eyes.

INT. BARTON PARK - MUSIC ROOM - EVE

Everyone watches MARIANNE as she plays and sings. Behind

them we see BRANDON entering. But he stays in the shadow of

the door and no one notices him. CLOSE on his face. He gazes

at MARIANNE with an unfathomable look of grief and longing.

He breathes in deeply. Suddenly, ELINOR feels his presence

and looks around at him. After a few moments, she turns back,

slightly puzzled. The song finishes. Everyone claps. The MAN

ventures out into the light and SIR JOHN springs from his

seat.

BRANDON bows to the company and smiles slightly.

ELINOR looks at him, even more puzzled.

MARGARET is quivering with fascination.

But COLONEL BRANDON knows what MARGARET wants to hear.

MARGARET smiles with satisfaction.

SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are bursting with their new joke.

They fall about.

INT. SIR JOHN'S CARRIAGE - NIGHT

The DASHWOODS are returning home. A row is in progress.

ELINOR stares at MARIANNE. MARIANNE colours and attacks

MARGARET again.

A heated pause.

EXT. POND NEAR BARTON PARK - DAY

In the background, SIR JOHN, ELINOR and MRS JENNINGS pack

the remains of a picnic into a basket. MRS DASHWOOD and

MARGARET examine a foxhole. In the foreground, MARIANNE is

cutting bulrushes for basketwork. Her knife is blunt and she

saws impatiently.

COLONEL BRANDON materialises at her side and wordlessly offers

her his hunting knife. Oddly nervous, MARIANNE takes it. She

turns back to the rushes and cuts them with ease. The

COLONEL's gaze follows her movements as if held by a magnet.

INT. KEEPER'S LODGE - BARTON PARK - DAY

SIR JOHN and BRANDON are cleaning their guns in companionable

silence--a habit left over from army days. SIR JOHN eyes

BRANDON roguishly.

No answer.

BRANDON stays resolutely silent. SIR JOHN is emboldened.

BRANDON cuts across him.

SIR JOHN subsides. BRANDON is clearly as angry with himself

as he is with SIR JOHN.

EXT. POND NEAR BARTON PARK - ANOTHER DAY

BRANDON strides along in hunting gear, a gun slung under one

arm, his dog trotting behind him with a duck clamped between

its jaws. The bulrushes catch his eye and he slows, then

stops. He stands for a moment deep in thought. Then he takes

his hunting knife, cuts one and walks off contemplatively.

EXT. BARTON PARK - GARDENS - DAY

An outdoor luncheon is in progress. COLONEL BRANDON is talking

to MRS DASHWOOD. Occasionally he looks over towards MARIANNE,

who is playing bilboquet with SIR JOHN and MARGARET. MRS

JENNINGS nudges ELINOR hard and gestures to BRANDON.

MRS JENNINGS lowers her voice to a stentorian whisper.

ELINOR is intrigued.

ELINOR is silent with amazement at this unexpected history.

MRS JENNINGS winks at ELINOR and rubs her hands as though

about to perform a magic trick.

BRANDON looks up.

He indicates MARIANNE, who smiles absently.

MARIANNE looks at BRANDON in some surprise.

BRANDON looks at MRS JENNINGS warningly but she ignores him.

Her tone is so knowing that MARIANNE frowns uncomfortably.

MARIANNE rises impatiently.

She moves away. MRS JENNINGS chuckles.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - LATE AFTERNOON

The DASHWOODS returning. MARIANNE is taking her bonnet off

so furiously that she simply gets the knot tighter and

tighter. Despite them selves, ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD are

amused.

BETSY pokes her head out from the dining room.

They all crowd into the dining room to find a large package

on the table, which MARGARET is permitted to open. In the

meantime ELINOR comes to the rescue with the bonnet and

MARIANNE stands shifting like a spirited mare as ELINOR

patiently unravels the knot.

MARIANNE smiles and ELINOR laughs at her. Then MARGARET opens

the parcel to reveal--her atlas. The atmosphere alters

immediately as MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE look at ELINOR in

consternation.

There is a letter on top of the atlas. CLOSE on the address

'To the Dashwoods'. MRS DASHWOOD picks it up, looks at ELINOR,

and opens

A silence greets this brief epistle. ELINOR struggles to

contain her bitter disappointment.

MARGARET is genuinely upset. ELINOR quietly hangs up

MARIANNE's bonnet.

MRS DASHWOOD looks beseechingly at MARIANNE, who nods and

grasps MARGARET's hand.

MARIANNE shoves her bonnet back on and drags MARGARET out.

We hear the front door slam behind them. There is a short

silence.

She approaches ELINOR.

ELINOR looks very directly at her mother.

ELINOR looks down. She speaks slowly, choosing her words

with care.

She clears her throat, rises determinedly, picks up the

accounts book and opens it. MRS DASHWOOD is silenced.

EXT. FIELDS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

MARIANNE walks very briskly, dragging an unwilling MARGARET

behind her.

EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

It has started to rain. Mists are gathering around the two

figures walking against the wind.

MARIANNE runs off down the hill into the heart of the mist.

MARGARET stumbles after her, grumbling. We follow MARIANNE

in her headlong descent and suddenly, dramatically, she trips

and sprawls to the ground, letting out a sharp cry of pain.

She tries to get up, but the pain in her ankle is too great.

She sinks back to the ground. MARGARET is very alarmed.

The mists have thickened. They can no longer see where they

are. Despite her rising fear, MARGARET squares her shoulders

bravely and tries to sense the direction.

She dashes off. As she goes into the mist we hear the thunder

of hooves.

CU Margaret's terrified expression. They seem to be coming

from all around. She wheels and turns and then--Crash! Through

the mist breaks a huge white horse. Astride sits an Adonis

in hunting gear. MARGARET squeals. The horse rears. Its rider

controls it and slides off. He rushes to MARIANNE's side.

He indicates her leg. Decorous, perhaps faintly impish.

MARIANNE nods speechlessly. With great delicacy, he feels

her ankle. MARGARET's eyes are out on chapel-hooks. MARIANNE

almost swoons with embarrassment and excitement mixed.

MARIANNE does not need any encouragement. He lifts her

effortlessly and calls to his horse: 'Bedivere!' It trots

obediently forward. The STRANGER smiles down at MARIANNE.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Rain is thudding against the window from which MRS DASHWOOD

turns, looking very worried.

But we can see she is trying to conceal her anxiety from her

mother. There are noises in the hall.

MARGARET runs into the room dripping wet.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

MRS DASHWOOD and ELINOR rush to the front door. They see the

STRANGER carrying MARIANNE up the garden path, his scarlet

coat staining the monochrome rain.

The STRANGER reaches the door. This is no time for

introductions.

They move into the parlour.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

MARIANNE is carried in, surrounded by ELINOR, MRS DASHWOOD

and MARGARET.

The STRANGER deposits MARIANNE on the sofa. They look straight

into each other's eyes. Electric.

ELINOR raises her eyebrows at MARIANNE, who blushes to her

roots.

He turns to MARIANNE and smiles. She smiles back gloriously.

He bows, and sweeps out of the room.

MRS DASHWOOD silences her with a gesture and follows him out

with all the solicitous charm she can command while MARGARET

pokes her head around the door to watch. ELINOR is removing

MARIANNE's boot and trying not to laugh at her.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

MRS DASHWOOD calls out after him.

The STRANGER mounts Bedivere and turns to her.

And he gallops off into the mist--we almost expect Bedivere

to sprout wings. CLOSE on MRS DASHWOOD's excited expression.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

MRS DASHWOOD runs back into the parlour, jittering with

excitement and anxiety.

MARIANNE hits ELINOR. MRS DASHWOOD tends to her ankle.

From below stairs we can hear MARGARET wailing Wait for me!

MARGARET comes back with the bandages.

ELINOR and MARIANNE go upstairs. MARGARET whispers to MRS

DASHWOOD.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - MORNING

The rain has cleared. SIR JOHN's horse munches grass

contentedly by the side of the road.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - MORNING

The DASHWOODS are having a frustrating time winkling

information about WILLOUGHBY out of SIR JOHN, who is in turn

only anxious to protect BRANDON's interest. MARIANNE has her

bandaged foot up on the sofa and is fast losing patience.

MARIANNE gives up. MRS DASHWOOD takes over.

Now they are getting somewhere. MARIANNE is about to ask

another question when they hear a horse galloping up. Everyone

is electrified. MARGARET runs to the window and turns back

in disappointment.

MARGARET runs out of the room.

BRANDON is admitted by BETSY. He is carrying a large bunch

of hothouse flowers.

He hands MARIANNE the flowers with a smile.

She rather absently hands the flowers to ELINOR, who goes

for a vase. SIR JOHN gestures at BRANDON with bluff

insensitivity.

BRANDON's light tone betrays no emotion. ELINOR comes back

in with the flowers and puts them on the table next to

MARIANNE.

Suddenly MARGARET runs in screaming 'Marianne's preserver!'

at the top of her voice. Everyone starts to move at once.

MARGARET is silenced. BRANDON looks at MARIANNE, whose

incandescent expression makes her feelings all too clear.

MARIANNE looks up, suddenly self-conscious.

ELINOR sees them out. We hear WILLOUGHBY's voice outside.

CLOSE on MARIANNE's radiant anticipation.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

WILLOUGHBY is shaking hands with COLONEL BRANDON and SIR

JOHN.

BRANDON looks at WILLOUGHBY for a moment. He bows. WILLOUGHBY

bows. Then BRANDON and SIR JOHN exit.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

ELINOR leads in WILLOUGHBY. MRS DASHWOOD greets him with

outstretched arms.

He suddenly produces a bunch of wild flowers from behind his

back and offers them to MARIANNE with a courtly, humorous

bow.

WILLOUGHBY sees BRANDON's flowers.

ELINOR takes the delicate flowers from WILLOUGHBY.

He is merry, spirited, voluble--a breath of fresh air. ELINOR

brings back WILLOUGHBY's flowers and places them next to

BRANDON's on the side table.

She indicates a chair but WILLOUGHBY sees a book lying on

MARIANNE's footstool, picks it up and--to her great delight--

sits down on the stool at her feet.

Everyone answers at once.

It is a general question but MARIANNE gaily commandeers it.

WILLOUGHBY joins in the line halfway through and continues.

ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD exchange glances. Clearly, their

contribution to this conversation will be minimal.

WILLOUGHBY gets out a tiny leatherbound book.

It is a miniature copy of the sonnets. MARIANNE is delighted,

and, mutually astonished at this piece of synchronicity,

they proceed to look up other favourites, chatting as though

they were already intimates.

MRS DASHWOOD smiles at ELINOR with satisfaction. ELINOR,

amused, picks up her sewing. MARGARET stares. WILLOUGHBY and

MARIANNE are oblivious to everything but each other.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY

WILLOUGHBY is leaving. He has a flower from MARIANNE's bunch

in his buttonhole and is on his horse, looking about as virile

as his horse. Everyone has come out to say goodbye, MARIANNE

supported by ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD.

He gallops off. They all wave. MARGARET follows him down the

road for a while.

Then she realises what she's said.

ELINOR turns back into the house.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

CLOSE on Edward's handkerchief. We can see the monogram ECF

clearly.

CLOSE on ELINOR staring out of the window. Tears stand in

her eyes but she presses the handkerchief to them before

they fall.

INT. BARTON PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE

After dinner. Tea has been served. ELINOR, COLONEL BRANDON,

MRS DASHWOOD and MRS JENNINGS play at cards. In a far corner

of the room, MARIANNE is concentrating as she draws a

silhouette.

WILLOUGHBY's profile glows behind the screen in front of

her, She looks up and stops, gazing, bewitched, at his beauty.

The lips move--a whisper: Marianne. Then, louder: Haven't

you finished? He moves out from behind the screen, eyes full

of laughter. They look at each other.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD are at the accounts. WILLOUGHBY and

MARIANNE are on the other side of the room in the window

seat, whispering together. Clearly, he is already part of

the family.

MRS DASHWOOD is silenced but sighs crossly. ELINOR looks

over to the lovers and sees WILLOUGHBY in the act of cutting

off a lock of MARIANNE's hair, which he kisses and places in

his pocket-book. ELINOR is transfixed by this strangely erotic

moment. WILLOUGHBY senses her gaze and looks over. She snaps

her head back to her sums and is astonished to find that she

has written 'Edward' at the top of the sheet. Hastily she

rubs it out and writes 'Expenses'.

EXT. BARTON CHURCH. DAY.

MRS JENNINGS is talking to the elderly CURATE. Other

PARISHIONERS exit the church as WILLOUGHBY's curricle (the

eighteenth-century equivalent of a sports car) goes flying

by. MARIANNE sits by his side, the picture of happiness. MRS

JENNINGS nudges the CURATE and whispers. The PARISHIONERS

stare after them and comment to each other.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY

MARIANNE and ELINOR are coming down the path together.

MARIANNE is dressed to go out. The argument has evidently

started indoors and is being continued here.

The conversation is halted by the arrival of COLONEL BRANDON

on horseback.

At that moment, WILLOUGHBY's curricle hoves into view and

MARIANNE's face lights up.

Even MARIANNE is a little embarrassed and recollects her

manners. She smiles kindly at BRANDON.

The COLONEL helps her into the curricle, exchanging nods

with WILLOUGHBY, who is regarding him with some suspicion.

The undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly tense.

MARIANNE smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up

the horses. They drive off, waving their farewells.

BRANDON looks after them for a silent moment, and then

collects himself and turns to ELINOR, who is less than

satisfied with their behaviour.

COLONEL BRANDON looks at her sharply and then speaks very

deliberately, as though controlling some powerful emotion.

He stops, and briskly remounts his horse.

EXT. BARTON PARK - DRIVE - DAY

People and carriages fill the drive, the sun shines and the

atmosphere is pleasantly expectant. SIR JOHN is organising

the provision of blankets and parasols and COLONEL BRANDON

is busy furnishing the DRIVERS with their routes. There are

three new faces a pretty, blowsy WOMAN (CHARLOTTE PALMER), a

stony-faced MAN (MR PALMER) and an exceedingly good-looking

GIRL (LUCY STEELE), who are standing with ELINOR, MARIANNE,

MARGARET, MRS JENNINGS and MRS DASHWOOD.

MARIANNE is standing slightly apart, looking out along the

road, impatient for WILLOUGHBY.

LUCY STEELE smiles shyly and looks at the ground. MRS JENNINGS

continues sotto voce to MRS DASHWOOD.

MR PALMER regards his wife with a less than enchanted

expression.

MR PALMER does indeed have the air of a man under siege.

WILLOUGH BY suddenly appears in his curricle. MARIANNE waves

to him with a radiant smile. MRS JENNINGS nudges CHARLOTTE

and points to MARIANNE.

WILLOUGHBY drives up as close to MARIANNE as possible, making

her laugh.

LUCY bobs demurely. WILLOUGHBY inclines his head politely,

leaps from the curricle and hands MARIANNE in. MRS JENNINGS

coos and chuckles at them. CHARLOTTE nudges ELINOR.

ELINOR smiles politely. WILLOUGHBY moves the curricle out to

the front of the drive. CHARLOTTE points after them and laughs

with MRS JENNINGS. LUCY edges up beside ELINOR.

ELINOR is relieved to change the subject.

LUCY speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though

not wanting anyone else to hear. At that moment a HORSEMAN

thunders up the drive towards them. Everyone turns to face

the new arrival.

It is a MESSENGER who has obviously had a long, hard ride.

He asks for COLONEL BRANDON and hands him a letter, which

BRANDON tears open. MRS JENNINGS is puce with suppressed

curiosity.

Everyone gathers round BRANDON, who is, naturally, mortified.

A SERVANT brings up the COLONEL's horse.

There is a murmur of disappointment from the party. SIR JOHN

is embarrassed and protests again.

As he speaks, he is mounting his horse. His grave urgency

silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone

stunned and, of course, deeply curious. Then they all start

to talk at once. LUCY is still next to ELINOR.

EXT. MEADOW NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

Having been denied their trip, the DASHWOODS and WILLOUGHBY

have set out an impromptu picnic. WILLOUGHBY is wandering

restlessly about.

The weather is sublime.

He gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing

her walk. He comes up to ELINOR and puts his head on her

shoulder.

ELINOR hits him on the nose with her teaspoon and he waddles

off to MARIANNE.

MARIANNE laughs. WILLOUGHBY drops the parody suddenly.

There is indeed an edge to WILLOUGHBY's raillery. He flicks

ELINOR an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps MARIANNE to

her feet and starts to dance around the garden with her.

He and MARIANNE are standing looking at each other. The

expression on WILLOUGHBY's face is heart-stopping. MARGARET

has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open.

ELINOR glances at MRS DASHWOOD but she is gazing up at them

with almost as many stars in her eyes as MARIANNE.

Suddenly WILLOUGHBY breaks the mood by swinging away from

MARIANNE and gesturing to the house.

The tension is broken. MARGARET starts to chew again.

He looks at MARIANNE, who has gone to sit at her mother's

feet.

MARIANNE is so irradiated with happiness that she looks like

an angel.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH AND GATE - DUSK

MARIANNE is seeing WILLOUGHBY off.

There is something about his formal tone that makes her feel

shy.

He mounts Bedivere and leaves. MARIANNE looks after him, her

eyes shining. He is coming to propose.

EXT. LONDON TENEMENTS - NIGHT

A district of extreme poverty, populated by the LOWLIFE of

LONDON: FOOTPADS, dogs, rats and SCAVENGERS of all kinds. In

the distance a tavern belches forth drunken REVELLERS who

sway and reel into the night.

A hooded HORSEMAN pulls up his exhausted steed at the entrance

to a slum. He dismounts and looks up at one of the windows.

The rags hanging there twitch as if someone is watching for

him. He strides inside.

INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT

Stepping over a supine BEGGAR at the foot of the stairs, the

HORSEMAN flings back his hood--it is BRANDON, hollow-eyed

and dropping with weariness. We follow him up the stairs to

a door which is opened by an OLDER WOMAN.

INT. TENEMENT ROOM - NIGHT

He enters a bare room partitioned with filthy rags hung from

the ceiling and lit with stinking tallow lamps. At the window

stands the slight figure of a VERY YOUNG WOMAN. She turns.

BRANDON reacts with a tender smile which stiffens into an

expression of deep shock. We see her silhouette. She is

heavily pregnant. She bursts into tears and runs into his

arms.

INT. BARTON CHURCH - DAY

Amongst the small CONGREGATION listening to the sermon drone

on, we see the excited faces of ELINOR, MARGARET and MRS

DASHWOOD.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY

The DASHWOODS return from church to find THOMAS grooming

Bedivere at the garden gate. Their excitement mounts.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

They all enter the cottage, talking nonsense loudly in order

to signal their presence. MARGARET giggles. Suddenly, MARIANNE

bursts out of the parlour sobbing, and disappears into the

room opposite. ELINOR and MARGARET stand by the door in utter

consternation, while MRS DASH- WOOD goes to MARIANNE.

MARIANNE shakes her head and waves them away.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

ELINOR, MARGARET and MRS DASHWOOD enter to find WILLOUGHBY

standing in a frozen attitude by the fireplace.

He cannot look any of them in the eye.

The atmosphere is thick with tension. WILLOUGHBY flicks a

glance at the three WOMEN staring at him in mute astonishment.

He rushes past them and out of the cottage. They follow him

to the door.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

The DASHWOODS cluster round the door.

She is silenced by ELINOR as WILLOUGHBY seizes Bedivere's

reins from THOMAS, mounts up and rides off at a furious pace.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

They all rush back into the parlour.

MARGARET nods dumbly and goes. MRS DASHWOOD has her arms

around MARIANNE.

MARIANNE struggles free.

She runs off upstairs and we hear her bedroom door slamming.

There is a moment of stunned silence.

She gestures to the room and then looks at ELINOR with a

frown.

MRS DASHWOOD is getting defensive. ELINOR pauses to think.

She stalks out of the room and starts up the stairs. ELINOR

follows her.

MRS DASHWOOD goes into her bedroom and shuts the door. ELINOR

is halfway up the stairs. She meets a wet-eyed MARGARET coming

down with a cup of tea.

ELINOR takes the cup and MARGARET runs out into the garden

in tears.

The sound of sobbing also comes from MARIANNE's room, and

now from MRS DASHWOOD's as well. ELINOR sits down helplessly

on the stairs and drinks the tea.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - RAIN - DAY

The rain has settled in. The cottage looks cold and bleak.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY

BETSY carries another uneaten meal from MARIANNE's room. She

looks at the food and tuts in anxiety.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

MARIANNE is sitting by the window looking out at the rain

through tear-swollen eyes. WILLOUGHBY's sonnets are on her

lap.

EXT. BARTON PARK - RAIN - EVE

Smoke issues from every chimney in the place.

INT. BARTON PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE

Dinner is over. MARIANNE sits listlessly by the window. MR

PALMER is hiding behind a newspaper. SIR JOHN and MARGARET

are looking at a map and discussing routes through China.

LUCY, CHARLOTTE, MRS DASHWOOD and MRS JENNINGS are at cards.

ELINOR is reading.

MRS JENNINGS and CHARLOTTE laugh at him.

The heavy silence behind the paper attests to the unhappy

truth of this statement.

CHARLOTTE and MRS JENNINGS start to gossip about the

disappearances of BRANDON and WILLOUGHBY. LUCY walks over

and sits by ELINOR, who politely puts aside the book.

LUCY looks around at MRS JENNINGS and lowers her voice still

further, so that ELINOR is obliged to move her chair nearer.

She looks away coyly as if deciding whether to speak.

ELINOR sits back in deep surprise.

ELINOR tries to ignore MRS JENNINGS, who is keeping a curious

eye on them.

LUCY rises and takes ELINOR's arm. She guides her as far

away as possible from MRS JENNINGS and CHARLOTTE.

ELINOR stops walking.

LUCY nods.

ELINOR is frozen to the spot.

ELINOR walks on mechanically. Disbelief has set in.

She sniffs and produces a large handkerchief which she holds

to her eyes so that the monogram is clearly visible. ECF.

ELINOR, seeing the copy of the handkerchief she has held so

dear, moves quickly to a chair and sits down.

MRS JENNINGS has been watching. Now she rises, unable to

contain herself.

MRS JENNINGS starts to bear down on them. LUCY whispers with

real urgency.

ECU on ELINOR's face.

MRS JENNINGS looms over them.

ELINOR cannot speak but LUCY glides smoothly in.

MRS JENNINGS claps her hands delightedly.

ELINOR cannot hide her dismay. MARIANNE springs from her

seat.

ELINOR exerts herself.

LUCY's calculating eyes turn to MRS DASHWOOD with alacrity.

A chorus of objections goes up, particularly from MRS

DASHWOOD, who is both delighted and relieved to see MARIANNE

with a smile on her face.

MARIANNE claps her hands, her eyes ablaze with joy. MRS

JENNINGS takes ELINOR's hand.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR/MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

We are in ELINOR and MARIANNE's bedroom. ELINOR is in bed.

She is lying on her side with her back to MARIANNE. We are

CLOSE on her face. MARIANNE is running around excitedly,

pulling out ribbons, looking at dresses, etc.

ELINOR cannot reply.

MARIANNE laughs.

CLOSE on ELINOR's expression as she struggles with the

impossibility of unburdening herself to her sister without

breaking her promise to LUCY. After a pause--

MARIANNE looks at ELINOR curiously, then returns to her

packing.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN GATE - DAY

MRS DASHWOOD and MARGARET are waving MRS JENNINGS's carriage

off. MARIANNE waves back with such exuberance that she

practically falls out.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S CARRIAGE - ROAD TO LONDON - DAY

MRS JENNINGS is chattering about London to MARIANNE, who

listens with new-found tolerance. LUCY is whispering into

ELINOR's ear.

LUCY looks at ELINOR sharply, but ELINOR is impassive.

We can see from ELINOR's expression that she understands

LUCY perfectly. The strain around her eyes is pronounced.

EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

MRS JENNINGS's carriage trundles along.

EXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Establishing shot of a handsome town house. MRS JENNINGS's

carriage comes into shot and stops in front of it.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - DAY

They enter the grand hallway under the supercilious gaze of

a powdered FOOTMAN (MR PIGEON). ELINOR is haggard after two

days of close proximity with LUCY. MRS JENNINGS is all

officious bustle and MARIANNE is feverish with anticipation.

She whispers to MRS JENNINGS, who laughs heartily.

MARIANNE hands a letter to the sphinx-like FOOTMAN. We can

see a large W in the address. ELINOR looks at MARIANNE

inquiringly but MARIANNE moves away from her.

MARIANNE glances self-consciously at ELINOR and follows MRS

JENNINGS upstairs. LUCY goes up to ELINOR and whispers.

But ELINOR does not know what else to say. She marches firmly

upstairs.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

MARIANNE and ELINOR have changed from their traveling clothes

and are having a cup of tea. At least, ELINOR is. MARIANNE

is pacing up and down in front of the window.

There is a faint knocking from somewhere. MARIANNE jumps.

MARIANNE looks out of the window.

She sits down with a rueful smile. Suddenly a much louder

rap is heard and they both jump. We hear a bustling

downstairs. MARIANNE can hardly breathe. She goes to the

drawing-room door, opens it, goes out, comes back in. We

hear a MAN's voice.

She turns and almost throws herself into the arms of COLONEL

BRANDON.

She leaves the room hastily. ELINOR is so ashamed of

MARIANNE's rudeness that she does not at first notice

BRANDON's mood of tense distress.

Silence.

But BRANDON interrupts her.

ELINOR is torn between discomfiture and compassion.

BRANDON stands very still.

His tone is heavy with some bitter meaning.

But he recollects himself.

He bows and leaves abruptly. ELINOR is deeply troubled.

EXT. GREENWICH ARCADE - LONDON - DAY

The PALMERS, MRS JENNINGS, JOHN, FANNY, LUCY, ELINOR and

MARIANNE are walking through the arcade. Additional wealth

has evidently encouraged FANNY sartorially and she sprouts

as much fruit and feathers as a market stall. LUCY is holding

ELINOR's arm in a pinionlike grip. MRS JENNINGS is gossiping

with CHARLOTTE.

MARIANNE's good looks are heightened by her feverish

expectation of seeing WILLOUGHBY at every step, and many

young men raise their hats to her and turn as she passes.

FANNY stiffens. LUCY's sharp eyes dart hither and thither.

MRS JENNINGS senses gossip. ELINOR steels herself.

FANNY smiles glacially.

MRS JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in sly triumph.

She and CHARLOTTE chuckle to each other. LUCY looks at ELINOR.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - EVE

MRS JENNINGS, LUCY, ELINOR and MARIANNE return from their

outing. MARIANNE immediately assails PIGEON.

MARIANNE sighs with disappointment and starts up the stairs.

MRS JENNINGS looks archly at ELINOR.

And she follows MARIANNE firmly upstairs. LUCY watches her

go, and MRS JENNINGS chuckles and turns to her.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

ELINOR wakes up. The flickering of a candle has disturbed

her. She sits up in bed and sees MARIANNE sitting at the

desk in her nightgown, writing another letter.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - MORNING ROOM - NIGHT

MARIANNE, in her nightclothes and dressing gown, paces

restlessly, her letter in her hands. A slight knock at the

door heralds a much-ruffled PIGEON, wig askew. MARIANNE hands

him the letter. He bows and goes, highly disgruntled.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - MORNING

MRS JENNINGS is giving PIGEON his instructions for the day.

MARIANNE comes running downstairs. PIGEON regards her drily.

MARIANNE looks so dejected that MRS JENNINGS takes her hand.

MARIANNE brightens.

She runs back upstairs. MRS JENNINGS calls after her.

EXT. GRAND CRESCENT LEADING TO BALLROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT

So many carriages have entered the crescent to deliver the

GUESTS that gridlock has occurred and people are forced to

walk to the entrance. We see MRS JENNINGS, MARIANNE, ELINOR

and LUCY alighting from their carriage and picking their way

through the mud, their skirts raised above their ankles.

ELINOR nearly trips and is obliged to grab onto LUCY in order

not to slip into the dirt.

INT. GRAND BALLROOM - EVE

The great ballroom is crammed with GUESTS all determined to

enjoy themselves despite the considerable inconveniences

caused by noise, heat and overcrowding. MEN are sweating

profusely, WOMEN dab their brows, rack punch is being

swallowed by the gallon, flirting is conducted at fever pitch

and all conversation is inordinately loud. Only the DANCERS

have a modicum of space in which to perform their mincing

steps. MRS JENNINGS and her brood bump into the PALMERS.

MRS JENNINGS then spots FANNY, who is conducting a desultory

conversation with an overpowdered ACQUAINTANCE. She drags

ELINOR, MARIANNE and LUCY over to her.

LUCY clutches at ELINOR's sleeve.

And she beams her approval upon ELINOR.

FANNY has seen JOHN threading his way towards them and waves

at him. There is someone behind him. LUCY preens. JOHN bows

to them.

He turns to reveal a good-looking young MAN with a vacuous

smile.

There is a general bowing and shaking of hands. ELINOR is

relieved. LUCY drops a low curtsy.

ROBERT looks ELINOR up and down. He exchanges glances with

FANNY before he speaks.

MRS JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in puzzlement.

ELINOR looks down, agonised with embarrassment.

He turns to LUCY and bows.

LUCY curtsies again. ROBERT escorts a most unwilling ELINOR

onto the dance floor.

Luckily for ELINOR the set changes and she is obliged to

turn away from ROBERT. She wheels round to face her new

partner. It is WILLOUGHBY! They both stop dancing and stare

at each other aghast. A traffic jam starts and they are forced

to take hands and resume the steps.

ELINOR does not know quite how to respond.

She looks about for MARIANNE, instinctively wanting to keep

her away from WILLOUGHBY.

WILLOUGHBY is shamed into silence. Then he sees MARIANNE. At

the same moment the music pauses. MARIANNE looks up. In the

brief moment of relative quiet, her great cry rings across

the room.

Everyone turns to look as MARIANNE rushes towards him with

both arms outstretched, her face luminous with joy. As the

noise of the room builds again and PEOPLE change their

partners, we are aware that many are surreptitiously watching.

MARIANNE reaches him but WILLOUGHBY stands with his arms

frozen at his side. MARIANNE gives a little confused laugh.

WILLOUGHBY looks extremely uncomfortable and glances towards

a group of very smart PEOPLE who are watching him closely.

Central to this group is a SOPHISTICATED WOMAN who frowns at

him proprietorially.

WILLOUGHBY shakes MARIANNE's hand briefly. Behind her, MRS

JENNINGS is giving an animated commentary to FANNY and JOHN,

while LUCY whispers in ROBERT's ear as they go past to join

the set.

WILLOUGHBY is sweating with tension.

He bows, white to the teeth, and walks away to join the

SOPHISTICATED WOMAN.

He is drawn away by his PARTY, some of whom look back at

MARIANNE with a mixture of curiosity and condescension.

MARIANNE almost sinks to her knees. ELINOR supports her.

MRS JENNINGS has come up, full of concern.

They almost have to drag MARIANNE away. MRS JENNINGS turns

back to the DASHWOOD party. FANNY and JOHN have practically

imploded with embarrassment and are distancing themselves as

much as possible from the source. LUCY and ROBERT are dancing

nearby.

She rushes off to follow MARIANNE and ELINOR. We stay for a

moment with LUCY and ROBERT who have left the set.

CAM rises to show the DASHWOODS exiting past the whispering,

sneering faces of the CROWD.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

MARIANNE sits scribbling a letter at the desk.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY

A silent breakfast. MARIANNE is red-eyed from crying and

limp from lack of sleep. MRS JENNINGS is dressed to go out,

pulling on her gloves and bustling as usual. PIGEON enters

with a letter on a salver. He offers it to MARIANNE. She

seizes it and runs out of the room. MRS JENNINGS chuckles.

She goes to the door.

She leaves and ELINOR finds herself alone with LUCY, who

loses no time in sharing her new-found happiness.

ELINOR rises and leaves.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

ELINOR finds MARIANNE sitting on the edge of the bed. She

does not acknowledge ELINOR but merely lifts the letter and

reads out, with deadly calm:

MARIANNE gives a great howl of pain and flings herself across

the bed as though in physical agony.

MRS JENNINGS bursts through the door in her hat and coat,

panting.

MARIANNE begins to sob uncontrollably.

She goes round the bed to comfort MARIANNE.

MARIANNE sobs even harder.

MRS JENNINGS leaves. MARIANNE seizes the letter again.

INT. COFFEE-HOUSE - COVENT GARDEN - DAY

FANNY, JOHN and ROBERT are drinking chocolate together.

He trails off. FANNY exchanges an alarmed glance with ROBERT.

She thinks fast.

EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - LONDON STREET - DAY

MRS JENNINGS's carriage stands outside. A livened FOOTMAN

opens the door and LUCY steps out brandishing a new muff.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

MARIANNE sits alone on the bed. Around her lie her notes to

Willoughby, her lock of hair and the pocket sonnets. In her

hands is the creased and tear-stained letter from Willoughby

which she is examining over and over.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

ELINOR is seated at a desk writing a letter. There is a sudden

rap at the front door. Footsteps are heard and as she turns,

the maid enters with COLONEL BRANDON. ELINOR rises to greet

him.

He bows. ELINOR is on edge. BRANDON looks haggard with

concern.

ELINOR takes his hands gratefully.

After a moment BRANDON nods. He seems unable to remain still

or calm and finds it difficult to begin speaking.

ELINOR nods.

This is strong stuff. ELINOR's concern deepens.

He paces about, barely able to conceal his distress.

BRANDON stops and looks straight at ELINOR.

BRANDON nods. ELINOR drops into a chair, utterly shocked.

BRANDON is silent. ELINOR is breathless.

ELINOR stares at him, aghast.

ELINOR nods and is silent for a moment.

A pause.

BRANDON moves to the door and then stops. He turns to her

and speaks with effort.

She looks up at BRANDON. Silence.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

MARIANNE is sitting on the bed staring into space. ELINOR is

kneeling by her, holding her hands.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - STUDY - DAY

ELINOR sits alone with her head in her hands. Suddenly MRS

JENNINGS hustles in looking pleased.

She is followed in by LUCY. MRS JENNINGS leaves, busy as

ever. LUCY plants an expression of ghastly concern on her

face.

The MAID comes back.

There is a tiny frozen silence.

ELINOR quite involuntarily sits down and then stands up again.

EDWARD is admitted, looking both anxious and eager. As LUCY

is sitting in the window seat, at first he sees only ELINOR.

But ELINOR cuts him off.

EDWARD turns slowly and encounters LUCY's glassy smile. He

all but blanches. Then bows, and clears his throat.

EDWARD has no notion of what to do or say. He swallows.

LUCY's eyes are sharp as broken glass. EDWARD remains on his

feet, looking helplessly from one woman to the other.

This is precisely what EDWARD had thought. He tries to smile

but his facial muscles won't work. ELINOR decides to fetch

help.

ELINOR goes to the door, thankful to escape, but MARIANNE

prevents her by walking in at that moment. Despite her

anguish, she is very pleased to see EDWARD and embraces him

warmly.

EDWARD is shocked by her appearance and momentarily forgets

his own confusion.

MARIANNE gestures to ELINOR encouragingly but EDWARD seems

unable to look at her.

Again, MARIANNE endeavours to ignite the lovers. ELINOR tries

to silence MARIANNE with her eyes but to no avail. MARIANNE

puts their coolness down to the presence of LUCY, at whom

she glances with a none too friendly air.

ELINOR is appalled by this remark but MARIANNE does not notice

it and turns back to LUCY earnestly.

EDWARD makes an uncomfortable noise.

Now EDWARD can stand it no longer.

ELINOR rises, desperate for them both to go.

LUCY jumps in like a shot.

There is an extremely awkward pause.

He shakes hands with ELINOR and with MARIANNE, who is silent

with dismay. LUCY takes EDWARD's arm and looks up at him

proprietorially.

After a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from EDWARD, they

leave. MARIANNE looks at her sister in astonishment.

EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY

A tranquil afternoon...

INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

LUCY is sitting with FANNY, who is doing some pointless

basketwork. LUCY hands FANNY rushes.

FANNY looks up, curious to know more.

LUCY leans forward to whisper in FANNY's ear.

EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DAY

We hold a long shot of the house for a moment of silence.

Then from inside comes an almost inhumanly loud shriek.

EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY

FANNY is trying to drag LUCY out of the house. ROBERT and

JOHN are trying to reason with her. FANNY loses her grip and

falls backwards. LUCY flings herself into ROBERT's arms.

ROBERT falls over.

EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

MRS JENNINGS is running as fast as her fat little legs will

carry her.

EXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BERKELEY STREET - DAY

MRS JENNINGS pants up the front steps.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

ELINOR and MARIANNE are packing. Their mood is gloomy and

uncommunicative. MRS JENNINGS explodes into the room fighting

for breath.

MARIANNE lets out a gasp. She looks at ELINOR, who nods at

her in swift confirmation.

She leaves the room, still rabbiting on. There is a silence.

MARIANNE looks at her in complete incredulity.

Clearly, there is no arguing this point.

ELINOR tries hard to be controlled.

ELINOR finally explodes. She turns upon MARIANNE almost

savagely.

Complete silence. Then MARIANNE speaks in a whisper.

MARIANNE bursts into sobs and flings her arms around ELINOR,

who, almost impatiently, tries to comfort her.

EXT. PALMER RESIDENCE - LONDON STREET - DAY

LUCY and MRS JENNINGS are on the doorstep. LUCY looks rather

lost and pathetic, with her little bundles, hastily packed.

The door opens and CHARLOTTE precedes the SERVANT, ushering

them in with shrill cries of sympathy.

EXT. SQUARE IN FRONT OF MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

ELINOR and BRANDON walk round the quiet square.

ELINOR is greatly taken aback by this unexpected query.

He pauses, frowning in remembrance. ELINOR waits in suspense.

ELINOR is completely taken aback. She takes a moment to reply.

INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - STUDY - DAY

ELINOR is waiting. The MAID announces EDWARD and he walks in

momentarily. They are alone for the first time in months and

for a moment, neither speaks.

ELINOR indicates a seat for him but neither sits.

He interrupts her, desperate to explain.

ELINOR has to stop him.

EDWARD looks completely bewildered.

ELINOR starts to speak rather faster than usual.

EDWARD cannot at first take it in. ELINOR sits down.

Now EDWARD sits--in shock.

EDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of growing

comprehension.

But EDWARD clearly believes she has been instrumental in the

offer. He frowns slightly before speaking with rather an

effort.

ELINOR finds some relief in saying at least one thing that

she truly means.

This makes EDWARD seem even more depressed. He sits silent

for a moment but then rouses himself to action.

EDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of sadness.

They rise. She curtsies. He bows.

EDWARD leaves silently. ELINOR stands stock-still in the

middle of the room.

EXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DAY

The PALMERS' carriage stands outside the house. COLONEL

BRANDON helps MARIANNE in beside ELINOR before mounting his

horse to ride alongside. MRS JENNINGS waves goodbye from the

steps. The carriage moves off. MRS JENNINGS blows her nose,

looks up and down the street in search of gossip and goes

back indoors with a sigh.

INT. THE PALMERS' CARRIAGE - ON THE ROAD - DAY

MARIANNE is sitting back in her seat with her eyes closed.

She does not look well. MR PALMER is behind his newspaper.

CLOSE on MARIANNE's eyes slowly opening.

EXT. THE PALMERS' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - DAY

The carriage bowls along, with BRANDON riding next to it.

EXT. CLEVELAND - DRIVE - AFTERNOON

The carriage stands outside the PALMER residence, a

resplendent affair with a great deal of land. BRANDON is

helping MARIANNE and ELINOR out of the carriage.

ELINOR and MARIANNE stand on the steps as the PALMERS debauch

from the carriage amid a welter of SERVANTS.

ELINOR cannot help but smile at this return of the old

MARIANNE.

MARIANNE walks off. ELINOR watches her go anxiously.

INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

MRS BUNTING, a rather baleful NANNY, looks on as MR PALMER

holds up a screaming BABY in a frilly bonnet for everyone's

inspection.

BRANDON flicks a glance at MR PALMER for whom holding a baby

comes as naturally as breathing underwater.

EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY

MARIANNE walks purposefully towards the garden wall, beyond

which lies a hill.

INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

ELINOR enters to find CHARLOTTE alone with the now hysterical

BABY THOMAS.

CHARLOTTE's conversational difficulties are drowned out by

her offspring.

EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY

MARIANNE comes to a gate in the wall and turns the handle.

It opens. She throws a glance back to the house and passes

through. There is a low rumble of thunder.

INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

BABY THOMAS is purple in the face but shows no signs of

quietening.

CHARLOTTE joggles him about inefficiently.

EXT. THE HILL - DAY

MARIANNE, calm and determined, walks towards the top of the

hill. The wind whips and plucks at her hair and skirts.

INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

ELINOR, traumatised by her new acquaintance with the shrieking

BABY THOMAS, goes to look out of the window. She frowns.

EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY

ELINOR's POV. MARIANNE is nowhere in sight. Storm clouds

have gathered on the bill.

INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

ELINOR turns from the window. BABY THOMAS stops crying for

two seconds.

There is a crack of thunder. BABY THOMAS starts again.

EXT. THE HILL - DAY

Rain has started to pour down. MARIANNE walks on regardless.

INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

CHARLOTTE shouts over BABY THOMAS to ELINOR.

EXT. THE HILL - DAY

MARIANNE has reached the top. Soaked to the skin, she stands

with the storm raging around her, staring at the spires of

Combe Magna, the place that would have been her home. Rain

streaks her face and the wind whips her hair about her.

Through frozen lips she whispers:

EXT. CLEVELAND - GREENHOUSES - DAY

BRANDON is looking for MARIANNE. He enters a greenhouse.

EXT. THE HILL - DAY

MARIANNE stares at Combe Magna, a strange smile playing about

her lips. Then she calls to WILLOUGHBY as though he were

near. The effect is eerie, unworldly.

INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

CHARLOTTE, MR PALMER and ELINOR are waiting anxiously. BABY

THOMAS has been removed. ELINOR is staring out of the window.

EXT. THE HILL - DAY

BRANDON runs up the hillside as though the devil were at his

heels.

INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

CHARLOTTE is handing ELINOR a cup of tea. ELINOR turns back

to look out of the window. She freezes.

EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY

ELINOR's POV of BRANDON walking up to the house with MARIANNE

cradled in his arms. It is like seeing Willoughby's ghost.

INT. CLEVELAND - HALL - DAY

Everyone rushes out of the drawing room as the COLONEL enters

with MARIANNE. He is exhausted and soaked. MARIANNE is dumb

with cold and fatigue.

ELINOR and MR PALMER take MARIANNE from BRANDON and go

upstairs, with CHARLOTTE in pursuit.

EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT - RAIN

The great house sits in darkness. A sense of foreboding.

INT. CLEVELAND - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

ELINOR is in her nightgown, knocking at a door. MR PALMER

answers in his nightshirt, astonished to have been summoned

out of bed.

INT. CLEVELAND - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY

MR PALMER and CHARLOTTE are sitting at the breakfast table.

BRANDON is pacing. The rain has stopped.

Enter ELINOR with DR HARRIS.

CHARLOTTE runs out of the room screaming.

EXT. CLEVELAND - FRONT STEPS - DAY

CHARLOTTE is getting into their carriage with MRS BUNTING

and BABY THOMAS. MR PALMER is on the steps with ELINOR. He

takes her hand and looks at her with real sympathy.

ELINOR is touched to find this warm heart beneath his frosty

exterior.

MR PALMER nods, presses her hand, and walks down the steps

to the carriage.

INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

BRANDON sits head in hands. His ghosts have come to haunt

him.

INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

MARIANNE is tossing and turning in the bed. DR HARRIS is

trying to take her pulse. He looks up at ELINOR, who is

watching anxiously.

INT. CLEVELAND - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY

ELINOR exits the bedroom to find BRANDON outside. She jumps.

He takes ELINOR's hand and kisses it.

EXT. CLEVELAND - DRIVE - EVE

BRANDON mounts his horse, turns to look at the house for a

moment, and then spurs it violently forward.

INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - EVE

ELINOR is by the window, having watched BRANDON's departure.

DR HARRIS is by MARIANNE's side. He turns to ELINOR.

EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT

The house stands in virtual darkness with only a dim light

issuing from one of the upper rooms.

EXT. OPEN ROAD - NIGHT

BRANDON riding fast, his cape billowing out behind him.

INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MARIANNE's eyes glitter with the fever. ELINOR wipes her

brow. Suddenly she speaks.

She is looking at the end of the bed.

ELINOR looks fearfully towards the end of the bed. MARIANNE

tries to smile with her cracked lips.

The dead are coming for the dying.

INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - LATER

ELINOR, her eyes red from watching, wipes MARIANNE's temples.

DR HARRIS takes her pulse and looks at ELINOR anxiously. His

silence is worse than any utterance.

INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - LATER

The room is very still. MARIANNE is pale as wax. DR HARRIS

puts on his coat. ELINOR looks at him fearfully.

He leaves the room.

INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - LATER

MARIANNE lies in the grip of her fever. ELINOR sits watching

her. Slowly she rises and walks to the bed. When she speaks,

her tone is very practical.

Suddenly, almost unconsciously, she starts to heave with dry

sobs, wrenched out of her, full of anguish and heartbreak

and all the more painful for being tearless.

She falls to her knees by the bed, gulping for breath, taking

MARIANNE's hand and kissing it again and again.

EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDENS - DAWN

A shimmer of light appears on the rim of the horizon.

Somewhere a lark breaks into clear untroubled song.

INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

DR HARRIS sits slumped in a chair. MARIANNE lies motionless.

ELINOR rises with difficulty from the bedside and goes to

the window. She is white as paper. The lark sings. Then,

from behind, comes the faintest of whispers.

ELINOR turns with a cry. DR HARRIS springs from his seat and

examines MARIANNE. He then turns to ELINOR with a smile of

relief and nods. At that moment the sound of carriage wheels

is heard on the gravel.

EXT. CLEVELAND - FRONT STEPS - MORNING

BRANDON helps MRS DASHWOOD, who is weak with exhaustion and

distress, out of the carriage.

INT. CLEVELAND - STAIRCASE - MORNING

ELINOR hurls herself down the stairs. She reaches the door

just as BRANDON and MRS DASHWOOD enter and practically swoons

into her mother's arms.

INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

CLOSE on MARIANNE's face as MRS DASHWOOD kisses her.

MARIANNE opens her eyes and smiles at her mother. MRS DASHWOOD

takes her gently into her arms. MARIANNE suddenly looks

anxious. She is too weak to move her head. She whispers with

urgent effort.

MARIANNE looks at her with deep relief. Behind the DASHWOODS,

BRANDON stands at the door, unwilling to intrude on this

intimacy. He wipes his eyes and turns away. MARIANNE sees

and whispers to him.

BRANDON turns back, his eyes full of tears. MARIANNE looks

at him for a moment. Then, very quietly:

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN AND SURROUNDINGS - DAY

The cottage nestles in the first buds of spring. A piece of

rope hangs down from the branches of a tree in the garden.

It starts to wave about wildly and we see MARGARET emerging

and climbing down. She has built herself a new tree-house.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

MARIANNE is on the sofa by the window. She is pale,

convalescent and calm. Different somehow. She listens intently

as BRANDON reads her the poem.

We move back to find MRS DASHWOOD and ELINOR at the other

end of the room, sewing peacefully.

ELINOR listens patiently as her mother rewrites history. We

cut back to BRANDON as he finishes reading.

He looks up at MARIANNE. A soul-breathing glance. She smiles

as he closes the book.

He rises to leave.

CLOSE on BRANDON's reaction.

EXT. FIELDS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

ELINOR and MARIANNE are out on a walk. They go very slowly,

MARIANNE leaning on ELINOR's arm. Their mood is loving,

companion able.

EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

ELINOR and MARIANNE walk on. Suddenly, MARIANNE stops.

She indicates a spot on the ground but ELINOR can see nothing

and is momentarily alarmed. MARIANNE gazes at the ground and

breathes in deeply.

ELINOR looks at MARIANNE, surprised.

ELINOR regards MARIANNE admiringly. MARIANNE smiles sadly.

ELINOR tries to stem the flow but MARIANNE continues.

ELINOR embraces her. They stand with their arms round one

another in silence for a moment. Then MARIANNE breaks away

and speaks with great good humour and energy.

EXT. ROAD NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

THOMAS is sitting on the back of a local wagon, holding a

basket of food.

He jumps off near the cottage and waves a cheery farewell to

the DRIVER.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

CLOSE on the accounts book, covered in blots and crossed-out

sums. Pull up to reveal MARIANNE labouring over it. Her

sickness has left her slightly short-sighted and she uses a

pince-nez that makes her look like an owl.

ELINOR is sewing and MRS DASHWOOD is snoozing. MARGARET goes

up and looks over MARIANNE's shoulder. She frowns at the

spider's web of ink.

BETSY brings in coals for the fire. MRS DASHWOOD rouses

herself.

MRS DASHWOOD looks nervously at ELINOR like a child who has

been caught out.

ELINOR laughs and rolls her eyes to heaven. BETSY turns on

her way out to remark:

There is a stunned silence. Everyone looks at ELINOR.

BETSY leaves. They all sit very still. MARGARET is about to

talk to ELINOR about it but MARIANNE stops her. THOMAS enters.

There is a pause.

THOMAS builds up the fire as he answers. He tells the story

with pleasure.

ELINOR screws up her courage.

But she cannot continue. MARIANNE glances at her

compassionately and takes over.

He nods and leaves, confused by the silent atmosphere. ELINOR

sits for a moment, then gets up and walks out.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - EVE

ELINOR is standing by the gate, looking out. MRS DASHWOOD

comes down the path to join her. She links arms with ELINOR

and they stand in silence for a beat.

A pause.

MRS DASHWOOD squeezes ELINOR's arm tightly.

EXT. OPEN ROAD NEAR BARTON - DAY

A horse and cart are jogging along. The cart contains a large

object tied down and covered with canvas. The DRIVER whistles

tunelessly.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - KITCHEN - DAY

MARGARET is standing on the kitchen table while ELINOR and

MARIANNE pin a piece of material around the bottom of her

skirt to lengthen it.

Suddenly there is a commotion upstairs.

Everyone runs out of the kitchen.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY

THOMAS and the CARTER are carrying a small piano up the path.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

They carry the piano into the parlour and to the DASHWOODS'

joyful astonishment it fits perfectly. MRS DASHWOOD reads

out the letter that has accompanied it.

MRS DASHWOOD hands MARIANNE the letter and a broadsheet song.

All the same, she looks conscious of the truth.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY

MARGARET is up her tree. ELINOR is pulling weeds. MRS DASHWOOD

is sitting on a stool working on MARGARET's dress and

listening to the strains of the new song which MARIANNE is

singing in the cottage. All of a sudden, MRS DASHWOOD rises,

shielding her eyes with her hand. She walks down to the gate,

looking out.

The piano stops. MARIANNE comes out and they all gather at

the gate to watch for the rider.

EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY

Their POV of a HORSEMAN in the distance.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN GATE - DAY

Suddenly there is a yell from MARGARET's tree.

MARGARET practically throws herself out of the tree onto the

grass.

The women look at each other in complete consternation.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

Tense silence reigns. Everyone tries to busy themselves.

BETSY enters.

EDWARD follows her in, looking white and agitated.

He bows formally to each of them, lingering on ELINOR, who

is looking firmly at her lap. He looks anxious.

There is a pause while they all search for an appropriate

remark. Finally MARGARET decides to have a go at polite

conversation.

MARIANNE looks at her incredulously.

MRS DASHWOOD decides to bite the bullet.

He takes her hand somewhat confusedly and accepts her offer

of a seat. There is an awful silence. MARIANNE tries to help.

There is another bone-crunching pause.

EDWARD looks extremely confused.

He plucks up the courage to look at ELINOR again and is

evidently not much comforted by what he sees.

EDWARD colours. He hesitates.

They all stare at him in shock.

ELINOR has frozen. EDWARD rises and goes to the window.

ELINOR rises suddenly, EDWARD turns and they stand looking

at one another.

ELINOR bursts into tears. The shock of this emotional

explosion stuns everyone for a second and then MARIANNE makes

an executive decision. Wordlessly, she takes MARGARET's hand

and leads her and MRS DASHWOOD out of the room.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY

The three DASHWOODS come into the garden, still holding hands.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

ELINOR cannot stop crying. EDWARD comes forward, very slowly.

ELINOR looks at him, her face streaked with tears of released

emotion, of pain and of happiness.

EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN

MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are stamping about in the garden

trying to keep warm. MARGARET has climbed into her tree-house.

The branches rustle.

MRS DASHWOOD can't help herself.

She and MARIANNE look at each other joyfully.

EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON - DAY

The figures of EDWARD and ELINOR can be seen walking, in

deep conversation.

EXT. PATH NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DUSK

Later. The lovers walk slowly, their heads almost touching,

their words low and intimate.

EDWARD stops walking. He looks at ELINOR and realises he can

stand it no longer.

He takes her face in his hands and kisses her.

EXT. PATH TO BARTON CHURCH - DAY

A group of VILLAGE CHILDREN run down the hillside towards

the church waving ribbons and dressed in their Sunday best.

EXT. BARTON VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY

A large wedding party is gathered outside the church. The

entire village is present--CHILDREN, FARMERS, LABOURERS,

SHOPKEEPERS, and all our PRINCIPALS. We see MRS JENNINGS in

a gigantic mauve bonnet, CHARLOTTE and MR PALMER, SIR JOHN,

MRS DASHWOOD, MARGARET, THOMAS, JOHN and FANNY, who is dressed

in a fantastically inappropriate concoction, and some MEN in

regimental uniform.

The path to the church is strewn with wild flowers and

everyone holds a bunch of their own. The church bells start

to peal, and a great cheer goes up as the door opens and

BETSY comes out holding the bridal cake aloft.

The bride and groom appear: MARIANNE, in white lawn, and

COLONEL BRANDON in full uniform. Behind them come EDWARD in

his parson's garb and, on his arm, ELINOR as matron of honour.

CLOSE on them as they watch the party moving away. MARIANNE

and BRANDON make their way forwards, everyone throws their

flowers over them, whooping and singing. An open carriage

decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them, and BRANDON

lifts MARIANNE in. His melancholy air is all but gone and he

radiates joyful life and vigour. MARIANNE also looks extremely

happy - but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her

seem much older.

According to the custom of the time, BRANDON throws a large

handful of six pences into the crowd, and the VILLAGE CHILDREN

jump and dive for them.

The coins spin and bounce, catching the sun like jewels. One

hits FANNY in the eye. She reels and falls over backwards

into a gorse bush. CAM pulls back as the wedding procession

makes its glorious way from the church. We draw away into

the surrounding countryside.

Then we see, on the far edge of frame, very small, a MAN

sitting on a white horse, watching. It is WILLOUGHBY. As we

draw back further still, he slowly pulls the horse around

and moves off in the opposite direction.
