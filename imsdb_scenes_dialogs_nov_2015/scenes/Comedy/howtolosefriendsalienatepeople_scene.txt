...British, fifties, a melodrama. We're looking at an

ACTRESS - glamorous, young - but very much in the back

ground of the scene - a secretary typing at her desk.

A YOUNG BOY sits watching the film, his clothes and the

room around him telling us this is England in the 1960s. He

is staring raptly at the actress.

SIDNEY (V.O.)

All my life I've been a Looky-

Loo.

We are CLOSE on an extremely handsome YOUNG MAN staring

past us with a dazzling smile.

SIDNEY (V.O.)

My name's Sidney Young. I'm a

journalist...a hack. (Beat) Yeah,

that...that isn't me.

We PAN right and down to our hero - SIDNEY YOUNG -

thirties, an odd-ball with a knack for getting people to

dislike him.

SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)

This is me at the Golden Globe

Awards in L.A. this year. That's

my Armani tuxedo. That's a Rolex

Sea-Dweller 4000 watch I'm

wearing.

Still in SLOW-MOTION we TRACK BACK and see that Sidney is

at a table with several other people, all staring raptly

past us to the stage which is out of shot.

Those people all around me -

they're all famous. They're my

friends.

Beside him sits a beautiful young woman - SOPHIE MAES

(20's).

2.

SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)

That's the actress Sophie Maes.

This morning she told me she

would let me have sex with her if

she won the Best Actress Award.

Still in SLOW MOTION, Sophie suddenly covers her face with

her hands and begins to stand.

SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)

She just won the Best Actress

Award.

Sophie walks out of the shot. Still sporting the fixed

smile, Sidney claps in SLO-MO along with everyone else in

the room. We TRACK away from Sidney past tables of

CELEBRITIES towards an EXIT.

My life didn't used to be like

this.

We PUSH THROUGH the EXIT DOORS and find ourselves

impossibly looking at...

...a crowd of FANS held back from us by a red rope, craning

their necks to see us more clearly, waving, cheering,

shouting, cameras flashing... Rain lashes down.

A CAPTION reads: "Sidney's Life, One Year Ago. Bafta

Awards. London."

SIDNEY (V.O.)

Looky-Loos. That's what They call

you when you stand out in the

rain all night just to catch a

glimpse of Them going by.

REVERSE - CELEBRITIES walk down the red carpet, pausing to

wave at the fans.

I used to pretend it was

different for me because I was

getting paid by a magazine or

newspaper, whatever. But that's,

you know...I just loved watching

Them. I'd stand outside looking

in through the window and think

what it would be like to somehow

get inside. But there was only

one way to get past the thin red

line that separates the

celebrities from the civilians.

You had to be famous.

3.

Sidney stands talking to a young PR WOMAN at the security

gate. He has a small, ugly PIG on a leash.

Babe?

Babe Three. Yeah.

She looks doubtfully at the pig.

Babe was a cute little piglet.

Harry Potter used to be a cute

little piglet too. What do you

want? Tempus Fugits...

He hasn't got any ID.

How many pigs are coming tonight?

Look, I was told to bring him,

hand him over to the producer,

Bob Milton, inside. You want me

to leave him here with you,

that's fine...

No, you can't leave him with me.

I've got...Hold on, I'll...

She looks around, helplessly. She begins to unhook the red

rope. Sidney tries to hide his excitement.

PR WOMAN (CONT'D)

If you're positive that you're

supposed to...

An OLDER PR WOMAN stalks over.

OLDER PR WOMAN

Well, well, Sidney Young.

Well, well...clipboard Nazi-type

woman.

She turns to the SECURITY standing beside them.

OLDER PR WOMAN

The pig doesn't get in.

4.

She starts to walk away.

What about me?

OLDER PR WOMAN

I was talking about you.

Sidney and the Pig are being "escorted" away from the red

carpet by the Security.

SIDNEY (V.O.)

The Looky-Loos dream is that one

day they will somehow get to

mingle with the stars. But the

Industry can't allow any

mingling. Stars have to be kept

away from civilians, have to be

quarantined, so they don't become

normal. Like us.

They pass a ravishing HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS walking the other

way. She looks curiously at the pig as she passes. Sidney

stares after her, longingly.

TRACKING through the doors and into the lobby of the

exclusive hotel.

SIDNEY (V.O.)

But after the awards come the

parties - the Miramax Party, the

London Records Party and, best of

all - the Sharps Magazine Party,

so exclusive that there are no

pass-alongs, no plus-ones, no

press.

We find Sidney checking in at the desk.

(to Receptionist,

How much? I only want to stay for

one night!

Sidney stands in the rising elevator, suit bag in his hand,

holdall at his feet.

SIDNEY (V.O.)

5.

This is where the movie stars can

finally relax, secure in the

knowledge they are among their

own kind.

We see the PIG'S SNOUT poking out of the zip of the

holdall.

Sidney turns from the mirror to face us. He is wearing a

WAITER'S UNIFORM of white shirt, waistcoat, and bow tie. He

is also wearing a WIG and FALSE MOUSTACHE.

SIDNEY (V.O.)

And that is when I strike.

He picks up a tray of canapes from the bed and looks down

to where the Pig watches him from the floor.

I want you in bed by ten. And no

porn.

He tosses the pig one of the canapes.

Sidney, tray in hand, peers around the corner to the

entrance to the hotel's roofed COURTYARD. The Older PR

Woman we saw earlier stands at the door, a formidable

presence. As we watch she greets an approaching CELEBRITY

gushingly. Seizing his chance Sidney darts towards the door

and, tray held aloft to cover his face, slips through into

the courtyard beyond.

...as Sidney emerges from the washrooms, now dressed only

in the white shirt and black trousers. He scoops up a

passing glass of champagne, checks his moustache and

surveys the courtyard - a room full of glamour: tanned

skin, diamonds, beautiful dresses, beautiful suits,

champagne. He stands surveying the crowd of A-list

celebrities in front of him, dazed.

You can do this. You belong here.

You're a star. You're a big,

bright shining star...

6.

The room is trashed - furniture over-turned, mini-bar open

and broken bottles all over the floor. A weird squealing

which could almost be human is coming from the bathroom.

ASSISTANT MANAGER (O.S.)

Hello? Sir?

The squealing stops.

ASSISTANT MANAGER (CONT'D)

Is everything alright?

The door opens and the Assistant Manager walks in and

stands staring around him in horror. Behind him the pig

emerges from the bathroom and slips out of the open door,

across the corridor and straight into the open lift...

Sidney is talking to a very famous and very drunk Hollywood

ACTRESS.

No, when I'm in L.A. I stay at

the Sunset Marquis, when I'm here

I always stay at the Sanderson.

It's, you know, I don't feel at

home these days unless I'm in a

hotel.

So what do you do?

Oh, I'm a writer. Movie writer.

Oh great.

Yeah. Got one in pre-production

now. You know it's really weird

running into you like this

because just the other day I was

telling the producer I thought

you'd be perfect for the lead.

She starts to laugh.

No, seriously, you would,

because, you know, you have this

mixture of intelligence and

beauty and fragility that we're

looking for and, uh...

7.

What's the film?

Tits of Fury.

She laughs.

I'm joking, I'm just...It's a bio-

pic. About Greta Garbo. That's

why I thought of you. You have

those amazing cheek-bones

and...are they real? Have you had

plastic surgery?

No. Have you?

Me? No, hardly anything. A penis

reduction as a child, that's

pretty much...

She laughs again, snorting into her drink. Sidney can't

believe this - she likes him!

The lift doors glide open and the Pig trots out and around

the corner. The PR Woman is still at the door to the

courtyard, berating one of her staff. The Pig sails past

them both, unnoticed, and disappears into the party.

A YOUNG MAN sits drinking at a table. He slips a little bag

of Ecstasy from his pocket and takes one.

UNDER THE TABLE

As the Young Man pushes the bag back into his pocket. The

Pig sits at his feet watching as the little bag slips back

out and DROPS to the floor. The Pig sniffs at the bag...

...still talking. The place is crammed now, and hot. Sidney

wipes sweat from his forehead.

Oh god, I'm drunk.

Are you?

8.

I'm so drunk. I haven't eaten

and...

You feel okay? Because my room's

just upstairs if you want to lie

down or, or loosen any, you know,

morals or...

What is your name again?

Clark. Clark Baxter.

How'd you do?

Oh, shit...

OLDER PR WOMAN

Sarah, get security! Code Red.

Sidney Young got in!

Who's Sidney Young?

Oh, shit!

9.

He lights a cigarette with a thoughtful air and watches

Sidney's flight, rolling the BOOK OF MATCHES between his

fingers.

BACK WITH SIDNEY

...as the Pig catches up with him and lunges at his ankles.

Sidney screams, trips and flies through the air, wig

spinning free, hurtling straight towards a table of

startled celebrities. We FREEZE FRAME.

SUPERED TITLE - "How To Lose Friends & Alienate People."

We hear the opening of David Bowie's Star.

As the TITLES and song continue we see a protesting Sidney

and Pig being escorted by Security through the endless

corridors of the Hotel.

Titles End.

FADE OUT.

A seedy flat in Shepherds bush.

Sidney lies in bed reading a newspaper in his underwear. A

phone is RINGING in the next room.

Sidney begins to cut out a photograph from one of the

papers - Sidney struggling with an irate Clint Eastwood and

some Security Men. The phone continues to ring.

Will you get that? (Beat) Will

you get the phone?

Sighing he gets up and scratching himself, stumbles through

to...

...which we see is, bizarrely, an OFFICE - full of an odd

assortment of JOURNALISTS, desks, antiquated computers and

an old fax machine. The walls are lined with past covers

from Sidney's magazine - The Post-Modern Review. One bears

a photograph of Victoria Beckham with the title "Posh

Spice? Like Fuck She Is."

10.

Look, we don't hate celebrities

at the Post-Modern Review, okay?

We just don't think they should

be taking themselves so

seriously. For us a celebrity is

a text to be deconstructed. Apart

from Costner obviously.

I wouldn't do this the honour of

calling it a review. It's a

puerile, personal attack in, in

alcoholic prose, in which

incidentally you manage to

misquote both Derrida and

Lyotard. I am a...

Girl.

...an internationally respected

academic and...

Prick.

...author of a very well received

book on the history of culture

and a...

Fuckwit.

(threading his way past)

Couldn't one of you answer the

phone?

Will you answer that? What do I

pay you for?

You don't pay me.

11.

Just get the phone!

Post-Modern Review.

Sidney, if she doesn't apologise

I'm quitting.

(to the Large Woman)

George can't leave. You'll have

to apologise.

Why can't George leave?

He owns the fax machine.

What?

It's Sharps Magazine.

YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)

We're finished.

We're not finished.

They sue, we're finished.

Shut up. (To the others) Will you

be quiet!

Sidney Young.

MAN (O.S.)

(over phone, gravel

This is Clayton Harding. I'm the

editor of Sharps Magazine.

12.

Ah, Lord Vader.

SHOOTING FROM BEHIND Clayton Harding's swivel chair - all

we can see is Clayton's grey hair, his custom-built desk

and the enormous office in front of him. He is smoking. As

he talks he rolls a BOOK OF MATCHES between his fingers.

I saw you at my party, just

before you ruined it with your

little pig stunt.

SIDNEY (O.S.)

You liked that?

Sure.

On his desk we see a few copies the Post-Modern Review -

glimpses of stars on the covers - Catherine Zeta-Jones,

Orlando Bloom... Clayton's hand sifts one copy from the

others and holds it up - the cover depicts CLAYTON HIMSELF -

patrician handsome, stern, photo-shopped so that he appears

to be NAKED. A headline reads "Clayton Harding - The

Editor's New Clothes?

Clayton's shoulder's heave with a snort of repressed

laughter.

CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)

(examining the cover)

I especially liked the part where

Clint Eastwood beat the shit outa

ya.

Sidney lights a cigarette, trying to seem casual.

We're not scared of you, Harding.

You want to sue, go ahead and

sue. It's like Jimmy Stewart

said, (a poor Stewart

impersonation:)"You sit up there

and you spin your little webs and

you think the whole world

revolves around you and your

money. Well, it doesn't, Mr...

Mr...

13.

Clayton is still flicking through the magazines.

Potter.

SIDNEY (O.S.)

"Mr. Potter..."You go ahead and

sue if you want, but I warn you,

if you strike me down, I shall

become more powerful than you can

possibly imagine.

An ASSISTANT walks in. Clayton looks up.

Miss Taylor is here sir.

Clayton nods and quickly throws the magazines into a BOTTOM

DRAWER of the desk. Sidney is still talking over the phone,

beginning to enjoy himself.

SIDNEY (O.S.)

Destroy me and a hundred more

will spring up in my place - men

who care nothing for success, men

who cannot be bought, men whose

only loyalty is to...

I want you to come and work for

me at Sharps Magazine in New

York.

Sidney stares to where the Thin Man is trying to get out of

the door with the Fax Machine, the Large Woman struggling

with him. The two fall to the floor. The rest of the staff

gather around them.

Fight, fight, fight...

Um...could you say that again

please?

We hear the sound of an aeroplane engine build as we...

14.

Sidney emerges from the airport, wearing his crumpled brown

suit, dragging his suitcase behind him. He stares around,

excited to be here.

Sidney drags his suitcase down the quiet street and stops

outside an apartment block, checking the address.

An elderly Polish lady - MRS KOWALSKI - is leading Sidney

up the stairs of the building.

This magazine you are working

for? It is good?

It's Sharps Magazine. You know

Sharps? It's sort of society,

fashion, crime, finance,

Hollywood celebrities...

Hollywood. Sodom and Gomorrah.

Now everybody is celebrity. You

take out your breasts, you are

celebrity.

(eyeing her chest

Well, I think it depends on the

breasts but...

In Poland, someone was famous

because they had done

something...Marie Curie...Pope

John Paul...

Yeah, they don't make

entertainers like that any

more...

Mrs Kowalski cuffs the back of his head. Sidney is somewhat

surprised by this familiarity, having only just met the

lady. She opens an apartment door.

15.

Mrs Kowalski shows Sidney into the small and cheaply

furnished apartment. Sidney's boxed possessions stand in a

corner.

They brought your things

yesterday.

Yup, this is good. This is...I

can put my drum kit just over

there and, uh...

She stares at him.

That's a...that's just a joke.

They're just little...congas.

When do you start work?

Tomorrow morning.

Well, you need to be fresh, make

a good impression.(Leaving) Go to

bed.

Just what I'm going to do...

A drunken Sidney dances frenetically on a small dance floor

made of squares of flashing color, compensating with

enthusiasm for what he lacks in coordination. The women on

the floor shuffle further and further away from him.

Sidney walks down the street, staring bright eyed at the

city around him, in love with New York. A SEXY WOMAN in a

short dress passes him. Sidney ogles her as she walks into

a BAR.

Sidney finds the Sexy Woman sitting at the bar. There is an

empty stool beside her. Sidney sidles into it.

16.

A Kona please.

(raising his glass)

Hi, my name's Clark. Clark

Baxter.

What the hell's that?

That's a water sir.

Well that's...that's not right,

is it? That's not...put a dash of

beer in that.

I'm sorry, my boyfriend's sitting

there.

Is he? He's fucking small isn't

he?

That's his White Russian. He'll

be here in a second.

Can you reserve these seats?

Nope.

17.

I'm a journalist. Work for a

little periodical you might have

heard of called Sharps Magazine?

I'm the Cultural Editor.

(to Sexy Woman)

This is a library card. (Reading

it) From Glow-cester...

(snatching it back)

That's...not that one...

(Searching wallet) I've got it

somewhere...I just...

Happy now?

Just doing my bit for the gene

pool.

Who's that there with Clint

Eastwood?

Morgan Freeman?

No, in the headlock.

You had this laminated?

Oh just give it...

Shit!

18.

It's okay. It's okay. I've got

it.

Just...just leave it!

Sorry.

It's pronounced Gloucester by the

way.

Are you going to get off that

seat?

No.

Do you know the meaning of Karma?

The curry?

(inscribing a circle in

What goes around, comes around.

The moment is approaching when

you will pay the price for being

an asshole. When my boyfriend

gets here I'm going to put my

pacifist leanings to one side and

encourage him to take you outside

and...

Hello? Hi, honey.(Beat) Oh.

(Beat) no, no, it's...don't worry

about it. I'll see you then.

Boyfriend not coming?

19.

She stares straight ahead, gathering her things.

Listen, I'm sorry. Do you

think...?

She turns to him.

Do you think I could have his

drink?

Alison gives him a cold smile, controlling her temper. She

spots a heavily made-up WOMAN walking past.

Bobbie?

Hey!

You want a seat? I'm just

leaving.

Thanks.

The Woman takes Alison's place at the bar.

(to the newcomer)

Hello.

He slides the PHOTOGRAPH over to her.

Guess who that is with Clint

Eastwood.

Alison gives a small smile and leaves.

Sidney and the Woman dance drunkenly around the room to the

music blaring from Sidney's stereo. The track finishes and

they stand gasping for breath.

I'm gonna powder my nose. Why

don't you put on something a

little more romantic?

She staggers off down the hall. Sidney, giddy with

excitement, searches through some LPs and puts one on his

old turntable. It's Ace of Spades by Motorhead. He staggers

around, playing air-guitar for a moment.

20.

The music is suddenly switched off. He turns to find Mrs

Kowalski standing beside the record player, staring grimly

at him.

Mrs Lebowski...

Kowalski. You know what time it

is? The music blaring, your door

open...

(trying to seem sober)

Was it? Fuck. I mean, shit.

Sorry. I just...met an old friend

and brought them back...

The Woman staggers back into the room, her back to us. She

is NAKED. She is also surprisingly muscular.

...for a little...

He notices the woman. His gaze drops to below the waist.

...penis.

Mrs Kowalski turns and takes in the view. Nobody moves.

A hung-over Sidney wakes up in his bed, light streaming

through the window.

He examines his reflection, psyching himself up for his

first day.

You can do this! You can do this!

He hums the fanfare from the Rocky theme.

Sidney walks into the room, still humming the theme tune,

shadow boxing. He opens the blinds and turns to the couch.

The "Woman" wakes up from where she has been sleeping on

the couch and gazes blearily at Sidney.

Quick coffee Bob and then you've

got to go.

21.

We hear the opening of Brian Ferry's version of The `In'

Crowd as we...

As the song continues we see Sidney swagger down the busy

sidewalk towards us. He is wearing sunglasses and a T-shirt

emblazoned with a photograph of Keanu Reeves and the

caption "Young, Dumb and Full of Cum."The T-shirt is riding

up a little over his belly.

SIDNEY (V.O.)

This is my city.

He stops at a gleaming chrome entrance and stares up at the

Heywood Building towering above him.

As the song continues Sidney, still swaggering, is escorted

through the formidable looking security by a thin and chic

ASSISTANT. The entrance hall arches above them, a vast and

impressive cavern of chrome and glass.

SIDNEY (V.O.)

This is my building.

Sidney leans nonchalantly against the wall of the lift

examining the Chic Assistant and two stunningly beautiful

MODELS who are in conversation. Sidney manages to catch the

attention of one of the models and flashes what he believes

is a rakish smile. In return he receives an icy glare.

SIDNEY (V.O.)

These are my models.

The Chic Assistant leads Sidney down a curving, red

carpeted corridor, past a chrome wall inscribed with the

giant logo of the magazine. They reach a set of double

doors which the Assistant opens for Sidney...

SIDNEY (V.O.)

And this...

Sidney walks through into...

Harding swings around in his chair to glare at us, a

cigarette in his mouth.

22.

SIDNEY (V.O.)

...is my Boss.

What the fuck are you wearing?

You like it? I brought you one.

Thanks.

CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)

Next time you come here dressed

like that, you follow the shirt.

You understand?

CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)

Sit down. How was the flight?

Good. Thanks for the business

class tickets, Clay.

That was a mistake. And don't

call me Clay.

Oh. Well, if it's any consolation

I got downgraded anyway.

That is some consolation.

Ha! That was just a little, uh...

as it happens I'm a big fan of

your earlier, funnier work. Snipe

Magazine that was...that was

really good.

23.

Yeah, you've...you've actually

been a big influence on me and I

really think together we can

inject a bit of that Snipe spirit

into this magazine. Now I've got

a few ideas that I'd like to...

You think you've arrived, doncha?

Well I hate to break it to you,

but you're only in the first

room. It's not nothing, don't get

me wrong, but there are plenty of

people in this town who never

made it past the first room.

After a year or so, maybe longer,

you'll discover a secret doorway

at the back of the first room

that leads to the second.

Eventually, if you're lucky,

you'll discover another doorway

back of the second room that

leads to the third.

CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)

There are seven rooms in all.

You're in the first, I'm in the

seventh, and doncha forget it

So...if I make it to the Seventh

Room - will I become a true Jedi

Knight?

Which brings us to the subject of

your sense of humour. I had a

look through your "magazine"

here.

What'd you think?

Oh, I thought it was...kinda

snarky. And bitter. And...

witless.

24.

Sidney digests this. Clayton seems lost in thought.

Finally...

CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)

I'm going to try you out in the I

Spy Section.

Sidney is hurrying to keep up with LAWRENCE MADDOX (40's)

as he strides down the corridor. Lawrence is Canadian,

handsome, one of the golden boys of the magazine and

arrogant with it. Other EMPLOYEES pass them as they walk,

heads down, expressions serious. The place is a model of

quiet, professional industry.

(glancing at Sidney's

Well, Sidney. We've only just met

but already I perceive I am in

the presence of a rare comic

sensibility.

Thanks.

I know your Hi-jinx gave you a

certain notoriety back in Olde

England but things are going to

be a bit different here. Harding

wants me to be your Rabbi, show

you the ropes. Are you aware of

what we do at I Spy?

You photograph famous people when

they're drunk?

I Spy is the nation's window onto

High Society. The Looky-Loos read

us because...well, They Weren't

There. The Glitterati read us

because we tell them They Were

There. For this system to work we

have to know where There is.

So...when we go out to clubs and

things...would that, would that

be on expenses or...?

This isn't a vacation. It's a

vocation.

25.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

When we do go out you're going to

have to wear something more

suitable.

Okay. What do you mean by

suitable?

Something that covers all of this

up.

Is that Mussolini?

(Beat.) )

No, Sidney, that's Richard

Heywood. The owner of this

magazine.

Oh. Looks a little like,

uh...(pointing to the child in

the photograph, smiling) Who's

this funny looking kid? Is that

his son?

That's his daughter, Elizabeth;

now my wife.

Really? Well, she's very...isn't

she? Really, very...

Miss Olsen here takes care of the

gallery openings, book launches

and other intellectual fare. Can

you find our new rookie something

to do?

26.

Sidney turns to find Alison behind him, eating an apple.

She eyes him coldly.

I hear the Cultural Editor's job

is up for grabs?

Alison sits working at her computer. Sidney appears and

perches on the edge of her desk.

Listen, seeing as how I'm going

to be sitting just over there,

don't you think we should try and

put last night behind us?

No. Get off my desk.

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to

be doing. (Beat) Are you going to

help me out?

Okay. Which way did you come in?

Sidney stares at her. Alison takes some contact sheets from

her desk and shoves them at him.

Chris Blick exhibition opening.

Caption it. Now get off my desk.

One of the magazines gorgeous Fashionistas - INGRID - walks

past.

Hi!

Hi, Ingrid.

Ingrid stares at Sidney's outfit, thrown.

(a wolfish smile)

You going to introduce me?

This is Clark Baxter. (Noticing

Ingrid's gaze) He's English.

(That explains it)

Ohh...right.

27.

Actually it's Sidney. Sidney

Young. Clark Baxter is my alias.

Why do you have an alias?

He uses it when he's trying to

pick up transsexuals.

Nice to meet you.

She walks on.

I take it you knew about Bob and

didn't tell me?

Alison inscribes a circle in the air with her finger

without looking up.

Sidney is on the phone. He is staring at some contact

sheets.

Hello, is that the Parsons

Gallery?

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Yes, it is. This is Celia Parsons

speaking.

This is Sidney Young from Sharps

Magazine? We're running some

photographs from your opening of

the Chris Blick exhibition, and I

just need to caption them. I was

wondering if you could help me

identify some of the people?

All right.

Thanks. So...Chris Blick. Man or

woman?

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

What?

28.

Is Chris Blick a man or woman?

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Are you sure you're calling from

Sharps magazine?

Yes, I am.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Tell me Stanley, why have they

given you this assignment if you

don't know who one of the most

famous artists in America is?

I...I don't really know.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

He's a man.

Okay. Is he an old man?

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

He's an older man, yes.

(staring at a

Okay, I've got two old men here -

so is he the fat one?

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

You do realize that Clayton

Harding is a personal friend of

mine?

What's that got to do with

anything?

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Right.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Parsons gallery.

Is he the one with the wonky eye?

29.

She hangs up again.

Sidney, coming back from lunch, gets into the lift eating a

HAMBURGER. Another of the magazine's Fashionistas - ANNA -

gets into the lift and tries to hold the door open for an

approaching friend. The doors swish shut, Anna pulling her

hand out of the way just in time. The lift rises.

It's fashion sensitive. If you're

not wearing Prada it'll take your

arm clean off.

Anna stares at this strange man with the burger, baffled.

But I am wearing Prada.

The lift stops and she gets out. Alison gets in, sees

Sidney and winces. She takes out a book and pretends to

read. The lift begins to rise again.

Through it's glass doors we see the different floors

passing, different publications - each a hive of sober,

hard work. Sidney stares at them.

This isn't what I expected.

Alison recoils slightly.

What did you expect?

I don't know. The Algonquin

circle. Dorothy Parker. Martinis.

Quips. Look at them. Not one of

them is drunk.

It's called being a professional.

You should try it some time.

There's something you should

understand. I'm not really one of

you.

By "you" do you mean "human?"

30.

I mean the glossy posse. Bunch of

Zombies, writing about "Pets of

the Stars" but acting like

they're working for the UN. I'm

here to shake things up a bit.

Where are you from?

Not that it's any of your

business, but I'm from Port

Huron, Michigan.

Right. Small town girl. (Hannibal

Lector impersonation) I bet you

could only dream of getting out.

Getting anywhere - yes, Clarice?

Getting all the way - to the

N...Y...C. (Dropping the

impersonation) Take my advice,

don't go taking this celebrity

fluff seriously.

For a moment Alison is speechless with anger.

You...you...arrogant...

The lift stops and a TALL WOMAN enters. She is expensively

dressed, wears Chanel dark glasses, an expression of

granite and an air of superhuman froideur.

Alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares

tensely ahead. Only Sidney, busy chewing, is oblivious to

the plunge in temperature.

For a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift. Then

Sidney begins to choke on some burger. He wheezes for a

moment, gagging.

The Woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of

having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her.

Alison closes her eyes.

Sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger

and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back

of the oblivious Woman's Prada jacket.

Sidney notices and raises a tentative hand to brush the

offending item away.

Before he can move Alison silently takes his wrist in a

vice-like grip.

Alison is haranguing Sidney.

31.

Are you insane? That was

Lawrence's wife, Elizabeth! Her

father owns Sharps!

That was her? The Mussolini baby?

I could go back and tell her

I'm...

No! Listen to me - you do NOT

approach Elizabeth Maddox, you do

NOT talk to her! Don't even

make eye-contact with her? Do you

understand?

Am I supposed to be afraid?

Yes.

I don't know the meaning of the

word fear.

I'm sure there are many words you

don't know the meaning of!

When I think of all the people

who would kill to be where you

are. And you lumber in here,

spitting food, haven't got the

brains God gave a mollusc...why

did Clayton hire you?

Snipe Magazine.

What?

When Clayton left college he

started this little magazine

called Snipe. Fantastic. Took aim

at every self-important celebrity

in town. Completely fearless. It

was like my magazine but twenty

years earlier.

32.

That's why he's hired me. I am

the young Clayton Harding. He

looks at me and sees his glory

days.

His glory days? Sharps has won

fourteen National Magazine awards

and increased its advertising

pages by more than 60 percent

since he took over. He's paid

millions of dollars a year. He

lives in a Bank Street townhouse,

and weekends in the Hamptons.

Clayton Harding is one of the

lynchpins of the media-industrial

complex.

Sidney stops to examine his reflection in a window.

Yeah, but don't worry. I think I

might still be in time to save

him.

The phone is ringing. Sidney walks in from the bedroom,

changing into his old brown suit. The answer machine kicks

in.

SIDNEY (O.S.)

(over answer machine)

You've reached Sidney Young. I'm

sorry but my answering machine is

out of order, so the voice you

are hearing is actually me.

The machine BEEPS. Sidney smirks at his joke and is

reaching for the phone when we hear the caller - an older

man, an upper-class English accent.

OLDER MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

(over answer machine)

Sidney? Are you there?

Sidney stops in his tracks, something complicated and

fearful crossing his face.

OLDER MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Sidney? Are you there?

Sidney tiptoes back out of the room.

OLDER MAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)

If you're there Sidney, answer

the phone.

We hear the opening of Fly Me To The Moon by Julie London

33.

Sidney sits in the car beside Alison and Maddox, staring

out the window, entranced by the bright lights as they pass

by...

The rooftop swimming pool of a hotel. Flowers everywhere,

including in the pool. Guests mill around drinking. We find

Sidney working his way through the throng to where Alison

stands.

There's a couple of hundred

grands worth of food here and I

swear I'm the only person eating

it. You want some?

Alison recoils. Sidney does a little nerdy dance to the

music as he eats.

This place is amazing. It's wall

to wall totty.

Wall to wall what?

Totty. Babes. Sexually attractive

women.

Do you mind?

What?

Maddox joins them. A man passes, nods respectfully at

Maddox.

Look at that. All night people

have been treating us like we're

royalty. In London, the

journalist's motto is "Everybody

hates us and we don't care."

Well, now you're one of the High

Priests of what's Hot and what's

Not. So what were you two talking

about?

34.

Sidney was just marvelling at the

abundance of "Totty" here.

Uh-oh. I don't think Miss Olsen

approves of you, Sidney.

I shouldn't be here. I get thrown

out of places like this.

This? This is a McDonald's. I

hate disease parties. (Off

Sidney's puzzled look) Fund-

raisers.

Lawrence Maddox? Oh my

goodness... Long time.

Rachel!

Rachel. How are you?

Well, I'm just wonderful.

Wonderful. How are you?

Funny I should run into you. I've

just done this great little film

called Five Boroughs and it's you

know, low-budget, first-time

director but very, uh, moving

and... Hey, maybe you could do a

little...?

35.

A handsome YOUNG MAN passes by. Maddox instantly turns away

from Rachel.

Angelo, good to see you.

Rachel hovers for a moment, embarrassed by her abrupt

dismissal then slips away. Sidney watches her go, feeling

for her.

You know that was Rachel Petkoff?

She's a fantastic actress. Hasn't

done anything for years, but, in

her day...

I'm sure.

Seriously, I've heard about that

film. I think she's going to make

a come back. We should get there

first, do a profile or something

before everyone else...

Maddox isn't listening. Instead he greets a fat, angry-

looking VERY YOUNG MAN. This is VINCENT LEPAK, wearing his

customary SHADES.

Vincent! Great to see you.

Children, I'd like to introduce

you to Vincent Lepak, enfant

terrible and in, my opinion, the

most exciting new director in

American cinema.

Vincent nods, frowning, looks around.

I think this is the worst

fundraiser I've been to in my

whole life.

It's a rat fuck, isn't it?

Sidney walks away.

...standing at the parapet, smoking, staring out over the

city with red eyes. Sidney appears beside her.

36.

Excuse me? Aren't you Rachel

Petkoff?

This is sort of embarrassing

but...

Could I have your autograph?

I'm a big fan.

Is that so?

Absolutely. I must have seen

everything you've been in. Those

episodes of The Love Boat and the

Bionic Woman? The Song Birds, In

The Night...I've even seen your

first ever TV appearance. The

Twilight Zone - House of Mirrors.

Right?

Right...

My all time favorite? A Day Too

Long. (He means it) You were

really great in that.

What's your name, honey?

Sidney Young.

Sidney Young. I'll remember that.

37.

...holding court to Maddox, Alison and some of the

Glitterati. Sidney joins them, eating more food.

You look around and it's all

shit. No-one is making movies

that are fucking worthwhile.

I'd have to disagree with you,

Vincent.

Vincent looks at him, displeased.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

You're making movies that are

worthwhile.

Vincent accepts this with a curt nod.

This is what I'm saying. You have

to inspire yourself. I am my role-

model. I want to be me...

He stares angrily around, handing his empty glass to his

waiting assistant who immediately replaces it with a full

one from a passing tray. Sidney watches him with dislike.

Greatest film ever made?

Excuse me?

What's the greatest film ever

made? (To Alison) Go on. Have a

guess.

Well, that's...I don't think

there is one single film that...

Have a guess.

Yeah, have a guess - what is the

greatest film ever made?

38.

I don't, uh...well personally I

love La Dolce Vita but...

Incorrect. Con Air.

I beg your pardon?

Uhuh, Con Air. It's got

everything. Malkovich for your

acting chops, Nicky Cage for

action, Buscemi for comedy, John

Cusack for the Gays. It's a

smorgasbord.

I don't think we've been

introduced?

Mister Young, this is Eleanor

Johnson, Queen of New York.

Eleanor this is Sidney Young.

He's from England and he's our

very own Idiot Savant. Without

the Savant.

Well, it's always nice to have

fresh blood at these things. (To

Maddox) Which reminds me, I'm

here with Sophie Maes, I want you

to meet her. New film, The

Suffragette coming out, the buzz

is A-mazing. The release is tied

in with the roll-out of the

Reebok campaign, and now Louis

Vuitton's on the line. This train

is leaving the station Lawrence.

So, you're a publicist?

I don't really like that word,

Sidney.

What should I call you?

39.

You can call me Eleanor.

She stares past him, across the pool.

ELEANOR JOHNSON (CONT'D)

There she is.

They turn to see a young woman standing across the pool

from them. This is SOPHIE MAES - a natural beauty,

statuesque, no make-up, hair simply pulled back.

Sophie tries to walk around the pool to join them but finds

she can't work her way through the crowd. She turns to her

right but finds her way similarly blocked.

She hesitates for a moment and then with a shrug climbs

down into the pool, the water up to her chest, and begins

to walk through the floating flowers towards them.

Sidney stares at her, TRANSFIXED. Alison notices this with

some contempt.

Gradually everyone notices Sophie and stops to look.

Having reached the other side, Sophie ascends the pool

steps, laughing, her dress clinging to her: Venus rising

from the waves. The Photographers appear, snapping merrily

away.

Oh, this one will go far.

Sophie, still in her wet dress, Eleanor and Sophie's

ENTOURAGE are striding through the hotel's corridors, on

their way out. Maddox, Sidney and Alison are with them.

(on cell phone)

Where's the car? What's it doing

at the back? Forget what I said.

I want the car at the front. Now.

Sidney finds himself walking alongside Sophie and Maddox,

trying not to stare at Sophie's breasts.

...I just think it's terrible the

way we're still exploiting

animals. That's why, you know,

I won't wear fur or leather, I

won't wear make-up, I'm

vegetarian.

I'm with you...

40.

I won't eat anything with, you

know, eyebrows.

Or if it can chuckle. I won't eat

animals that can chuckle.

I'm sorry, I can't understand

your accent?

Nothing, just, uh...So you're an

actress? Have I seen you in

anything?

I don't know. Have you?

No. (Trying again) So you haven't

won any Oscars yet?

No.

Because I would certainly vote

for you for best supporting

dress! Huh, huh, huh....

I haven't been nominated for

anything.

No, I'm just...I'm saying you

look...

Are you ready dear?

41.

REVERSE - the group framed in the entrance-way - blinded

by the glare, squinting. Only Sophie has her eyes open,

smiling, looking like a star.

The Paparazzi are still crowding around the group as they

make their way to the waiting car.

We're going on to the Circle

Club. I'll see you tomorrow.

Okay. Good night.

Maddox slips his jacket around Sophie's shoulders.

Aren't you cold?

I'm from Canada, land of ice and

snow.

They get into the car. Sidney tries to follow them.

Budge up.

Where are you going?

I'm coming to the club.

Sorry, you're not on the list.

A small CHIHUAHUA - CUBA - on Sophie's lap snarls at

Sidney.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

See? Even Cuba says so.

Maddox closes the door and the car glides away, Sophie

kissing the dog on the nose. The Paparazzi hurry back to

the entrance as another celebrity emerges, leaving Alison

and Sidney staring after the car.

That's... that turns my stomach.

Pawing her like that. He's old

enough to be her father.

42.

No he isn't.

Yes he is. I started producing

sperm when I was thirteen, so you

know, technically...

For your information he wasn't

pawing her! He was just doing his

job! In case you haven't noticed

Sharps has to have a star on the

cover every month. And most of

those stars are clients of

Eleanor's. So do not piss her

off.

She's a flak. Hacks don't take

orders from flaks. And I don't

think you can call that "doing

his job." The man had no blood

left in his upper body...

Will you...? Oh, and next time

you want to do the hilariously

ironic I love Con Air skit would

you mind...?

I wasn't being ironic...

...would you mind not involving

me, especially in the presence of

Vincent Lepak who happens to be

very important.

Yeah, I could tell by the way he

was allowed to stay up past his

bed time.

Do you think she'd go out with

me?

Who?

Sophie Maes. You think she'll go

out with me?

43.

No. Girls like Sophie don't date

journalists. As far as she's

concerned, you're the help.

What do you know? A lot of these

starlets are lonely. They spend

their time looking for a man.

Alison starts to walk away.

This is New York, Sidney. Women

only date men who are

successful...

I'm going to be successful.

(as she goes)

...and tall.

Sidney sits in front of his computer reading the on-line

New York Post Page Six. A story on the previous night is

accompanied by a large picture of Sophie in her clinging

dress. Above the picture is the title Venus Envy. Sidney

stares at the picture, entranced.

Alison sits at her desk, watching him with contempt. Maddox

appears beside them.

Have you seen this? She's

everywhere.

An ASSISTANT walks over with a MUFFIN BASKET for Maddox.

From Sophie Maes.

(reading the card)

"Thanks for a great night." What

a sweet kid. Oh, Sidney, about

last night - word of advice.

Don't talk to the celebrities,

okay? Sophie said you made her

feel uncomfortable.

He walks off with a slight smirk. Sidney glowers after him.

44.

Sidney walks down the corridor. He slows, his expression

changing suddenly.

SIDNEY'S P.O.V - Elizabeth Maddox is walking down the

corridor towards us, face set.

Sidney keeps on walking, staring to one side of Elizabeth.

As they draw level, the heel of one of Elizabeth's shoes

snaps off and she lurches sideways, colliding with the wall

before sprawling onto the floor in front of Sidney.

Sidney hesitates. He notices Alison watching with baited

breath from the other end of the corridor. For a moment

nobody moves then Sidney steps over Elizabeth's prone form

without a word and keeps on walking.

Alison gives a sigh of relief, nods in approval and walks

on.

Clayton heads a monthly staff meeting. A rather smug Maddox

is just finishing a pitch.

...so Brad's people finally got

back to me and they've agreed.

We've got the whole afternoon,

before the shoot.

People clap. Harding nods approvingly.

Good work Lawrence. Okay, well,

if that's it for...

He starts to get up.

So, I was thinking, Clay...

Clayton, pauses, frowning. Sidney turns to the room,

cocksure.

Paris Hilton. I do a profile on

her as if she's this complete

recluse, this hermit...(laughing)

I try and track her down and, you

know, "Who is the elusive Paris

Hilton and why is she so

publicity shy?"

He laughs for a moment. No one joins in.

45.

That's first room stuff, Sidney.

And call me Clay one more time

and see what happens.

Harding stalks out of the room. Blushing, Sidney stares

after him, nodding vaguely. As he gathers his notebook he

becomes aware of the smirks on the faces of Maddox and the

others as they leave.

Alison sits with her notebook and pen. Behind her some of

the magazine's glamorous Fashionistas - VICKY, INGRID and

ANNA - are examining some clothes.

No, I'd love these but I'm so fat

I couldn't...

Get out of here!

You look totally rexy.

Alice?

Alison hides her irritation with a smile.

Alison.

Tell Vicky she looks rexy.

Rexy?

Anorexic.

Well...you do look like you could

do with a few more pounds.

Oh god, that's so sweet.

By the way, post-shoot clear out.

Got some Gucci pants here that

are way too big for us. You wanna

try?

46.

(another tight smile)

No, thanks.

I don't mean to be rude Sidney

but...what the fuck do you want?

Listen, you know how things work

around here. How am I going to

get something in the magazine?

I thought all this "fluff" was

beneath you?

It is but...things have changed.

What's changed?

Look, I know people think I'm a

bit of an idiot and maybe I

haven't started off too well

here, but I want...I want...

...I want to have sex with Sophie

Maes. (Beat) Before Maddox does.

You're loathsome, you know that?

I know he's got a head start on

me but I'm going to win her back.

Once I get my hooks into a girl,

they never get free.

Like ring-worm.

47.

The gloves are coming off.

We hear the opening of Brigitte Bardot's Moi Je Joue as

we...

Sidney is pitching to Clayton in the elevator.

Okay. Celebrity Trash Cans. The

contents of celebrity trash cans

are revealed and readers have

gotta guess who the trash belongs

to... Five bottles of Jack

Daniels, a court order, and a

copy of Mein Kampf? Mel Gibson!

(getting out the lift)

First Room, Sidney. First room.

A small group of GLITTERATI pass the immense line of

hopefuls waiting outside the club and are ushered inside by

the DOORMAN at the entrance. Sidney walks confidently up,

pretending to talk into his cell. The Doorman stands in his

way, impassive. Still talking Sidney turns and walks away

as if nothing has happened.

Sidney standing with a MODEL-TYPE in the elevator. He takes

a LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH from his wallet and shows it to her.

(pointing at the snap)

Guess who that is with Clint

Eastwood?

Morgan Freeman?

No, not...why's everyone say...?

There! In the head-lock!

Sidney pitches to a closed door in the office. He is

holding a LARGE PIECE OF CARD on which is drawn a TREE

decorated with the heads of various CELEBRITIES.

48.

It's a Shag Tree. It illustrates

all of the sexual pairings of

Hollywood's top stars and how

they interconnect...

From under the door slides a piece of paper on which is

written First Room. We hear a TOILET FLUSH.

Sidney approaches the Doorman , takes a ten dollar bill

from his pocket and hands it to the Doorman. The Doorman

crumples the bill up and throws it away. Without a word

Sidney begins to walk away. He comes back and picks up the

crumpled note and then heads off again.

Harding is eating lunch at his desk. He looks up and finds

Sidney staring down at him with puppy-dog eyes. Beat.

Harding sighs.

If I give you an interview will

ya leave me the fuck alone?

Sidney smiles. The song ends.

Nathan Lane shakes hands with Sidney as he sits down.

Nathan Lane. Nice to meet you.

Great to meet you Nathan. I'm a

big fan. I love that rat thing

you played in The Lion King.

Actually he's a meer cat.

(absently, checking his

Uhuh... Now, I've been doing some

research and I think you're

probably quite a private man. Am

I right?

Well...

49.

Which is fine, but today, I think

it would be great to get behind

the mask.

Uh, I don't think there really is

a mask as such, and I don't wanna

be a pain, but what I really

wanna talk about is the new play,

keep it about the work, you know?

Is that okay?

Absolutely. Of course. So, first

question - are you Jewish?

Nathan stares at Sidney.

I don't see what the relevance of

that is.

Okay. Next question. The rat

thing - that's gotta be Disney's

first gay animal, right? So, I

was wondering - are you a

homosexual?

Beat. Nathan looks like he might hit Sidney.

Clayton glares at Sidney from behind his desk.

What did I say to you?

What...?

What did I say to you?

I just...

What did I say to you?

Don't upset anyone.

Don't upset anyone.

50.

I was just trying to...probe.

You wanna probe become a

proctologist, okay? You can't ask

musical comedy stars whether

they're Jewish or gay. From now

on just assume they're all Jewish

and all gay, okay?

Sidney is on the phone. He has been idly applying magic

tape to his face, contorting it into a grotesque grimace.

The headline of a magazine open in front of him reads:

"Everyone Loves A Lord: Why British Titles Drive New York

Women Crazy."

I'd like to apply for an American

Express card please? (Beat) Hon.

Sidney Young. (Beat) As in

Honourable. H-O-N. (Beat)It's a

British title.

Across the desk Alison watches him with contempt.

The Queen? Yeah, I know the

Queen. Just fill in the form will

you?

Sidney suddenly notices Sophie Maes and Eleanor Johnson

walking towards them. Sophie looks more STYLED than before.

She is holding her Chihuahua, Cuba, which is dressed in a

tiny coat. Sidney DISAPPEARS UNDER THE DESK. We hear a RIP

as he yanks the tape off his face.

SIDNEY (O.S.)(CONT'D)

(in pain, under desk)

Oh, fuck...!

Hey! Cuba!

He pets the dog, who greets him enthusiastically.

He likes you.

Well, I'm one of the Friends Of

Cuba.

51.

He laughs, Sophie smiles, not getting it. Alison seems

immersed in some paper-work.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

So how's it feel to be a star?

No, don't! It's so embarrassing!

That picture's everywhere now.

And I had no idea the dress was

so see-through! And people are

talking like it was some kind of

stunt.

Such a cynical age. Hello

Sidney.

Embarrassed, Sidney gets up from under his desk.

Hello! Didn't, didn't know you

were coming in...?

Lawrence is taking us to lunch at

Cipriani.

Oh great. That's great.

Lawrence? Could I leave Cuba

here? He doesn't like Italian

food.

Of course you can. He can stay in

my office. Sidney? Fetch Cuba a

bowl of water, will you?

Sidney stares at him.

(forcing a smile)

Of course.

Eleanor is getting a cup of water from the cooler. Sidney

joins her, waiting to fill the dog's bowl.

That is a lovely ring. Where is

that from?

52.

It was my mother's. She gave it

to me.

Oh, you Sweetie. That is very,

very...(dismissing the topic) So,

listen...You've met Vincent

Lepak haven't you, Sidney?

Uhuh.

He has a new movie coming out

soon and Lawrence is over-

stretched as it is. How would you

like to write a story on him?

A story? Absolutely. That

would...I'd love to...

Well, great. Maybe we could get

together and discuss the angle?

Okay. (Beat) What do you mean?

Well, I'd need to know how we're

going to present Vincent, check

the story, so on.

You want copy approval?

Any stories written about my

clients need to be in their best

interest, that's all. If things

work out with Vincent we could

maybe talk about a follow up

story on Sophie? What do you

think?

53.

Sidney looks over at Sophie, struggling with himself.

Finally...

I'm sorry, Eleanor, I don't...I

don't work that way.

Alison stares with surprise at Sidney. He just went up in

her estimation.

Sidney dear, think of it like

this: you write about one of my

clients, you are borrowing some

of their "star-light" to help

sell your magazine. All I'm

saying is quid pro quo.

Sidney is unable to hold back a snicker.

Their star-light?

Eleanor's face hardens.

Sidney watches Sophie, Maddox and Eleanor as they walk

towards reception.

Sidney cracks open the door and peers inside. Cuba sits in

the middle of the floor, staring at him. He emits a low

growl.

Sidney slides into the room.

Hello Cuba. I'm Uncle Sidney,

come to see how you are. You

wanna play? You wanna little

play?

He takes a RUBBER BALL out of his pocket and holds it up

for the dog to see.

Fetch!

He tosses the ball in the air. Cuba runs after it and

trots back, stumpy tail wagging, the ball in its teeth.

That's it! That's it!

54.

He strokes the dog.

We're gonna be best pals aren't

we? You're going to like me more

than that prick Maddox, aren't

you? Fetch!

He tosses the ball again which promptly bounces off the

wall straight out of the half open window.

No!

Cuba is already running towards the window...

Sidney's yell slows and distorts as we move to SLOW

MOTION...

Sidney springs forward, leaping onto the desk and then in

one bound onto a FILING CABINET by the window, sending it

rocking slightly forward.

Cuba, bounding forward, jumps into the air...

Sidney just manages to slam the window SHUT as...

BACK IN NORMAL TIME...

Cuba bounces off the glass with a yelp and drops to the

floor.

Sidney heaves a sigh of relief.

Then a METAL SCULPTURE on the tilted filing cabinet slides

forward and drops with a TERMINAL THUD ON THE DOG BELOW.

Silence.

Sidney stares down to the floor.

Cuba?

Sidney stands at the lift holding a bulging bag.

(waiting for the lift)

C'mon...C'mon...

Alison walks past, sees him and does a double-take.

(seeing her coming)

Shit, shit, shit...

55.

That's my bag.

I'm just...just borrowing it.

I'll bring it straight back.

What are you talking about? Give

it back.

She reaches out to take the bag. Sidney holds on

desperately.

Stop it! Give me the...

She tugs violently, pulling the bag open. A small PAW lolls

out. Alison freezes staring at it. Silence.

Oh my God.

It was an accident.

Oh my God.

I was just trying to make

friends. Please don't tell her.

Please don't tell her.

SOPHIE MAES (O.S.)

Cuba? Cuba?

Startled, Sidney darts into Maddox's office.

As footsteps and voices approach Sidney tugs wildly at

Maddox's window, trying to open it. Alison follows him in.

What are you doing? You can't...!

He jerks the window open and empties Cuba out of it,

slamming it shut just as Sophie, Eleanor and Lawrence walk

in.

Alison, have you seen Cuba?

56.

W-What?

She darts a glance over to where Sidney stands with his

back to the window, gazing at her pleadingly. From behind

him comes a faint creaking sound.

Sophie's dog! Have you seen him?

Sidney hangs his head, awaiting the coup de grace.

Uh...no. No idea.

Sidney stares at her in amazement.

Behind him Cuba's body appears at the window, rising into

view on a WINDOW WASHING PLATFORM. A Window Washer, stands

at the other end of the cradle, bobbing his head to the

music in his headphones.

Alison stares at the dog in horror while the others talk,

oblivious.

Don't worry, he couldn't have got

very far.

Cuba? Cuba!

Cuba trundles on up to the sky.

Clayton stands at the window. He is DRUNK. There is a knock

at the door and Sidney walks in.

Clayton? Have you got a minute?

Clayton lights a cigarette, stares out of the window.

Sidney comes in.

Did they find that rat yet?

No...Not yet. I think maybe he

got out the building?

Sidney hovers.

57.

Congratulations on the Man of the

Year thing. How was the lunch?

I don't know. Thousand dollars a

plate, all I could taste was ass.

I'm kissing their ass, they're

kissing my ass. (Beat) I get this

dream sometimes. Someone's set

fire to the building - Heywoods -

Sharps magazine - the whole

thing, it's going up in flames.

My analyst thinks it's an anxiety

dream. I never tell him how happy

I am watching the fucker burn.

CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)

What do you want?

I want to do a story on Vincent

Lepak. Not a puff-piece.

Something funny, but with teeth.

The kind of thing Snipe would

have done. Everyone's treating

him like he's a genius and he's

an idiot.

Look at these things. How'd I get

a closet full of blue fucking

shirts?

Um...I don't know.

I don't know either. This is an

office for Christ's sake! Why've

I even got a fucking closet?

CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)

Do it.

(he can't believe it)

Do it?

58.

Fuck it. Yeah. Do it. He's an

annoying little prick. Go take

him down. This is your shot.

Thanks Clayton!

You're my little Hit Man.

I'm your little Hit Man!

Go do it!

Okay!

He scuttles out. He ducks back around the door.

You could call me The Jackal!

Out.

Okay!

He ducks back out again.

Sidney is waiting in the lobby. A slightly spaced YOUNG

WOMAN approaches him.

Mister Young?

Yes?

I'm Sophie Maes' assistant. I'm

afraid Sophie isn't here right

now.

(looking past her)

Look I know she's in. I'm not a

stalker. I just know she's upset

about losing her dog and...

59.

She isn't here.

Well, can I at least check that

she got my present?

Okay. Did you send the flowers?

Flowers? Yeah,'cos she doesn't

get enough flowers, does she? No,

I sent her the fish.

The Young Woman looks suddenly nervous.

Oh.

Gold-fish. In a bowl. Did she get

them?

Yes, but...they were dead.

All of them?

Yeah. It was kinda shocking. Were

they dead when you sent them?

Sidney stares at her.

What? No, they were... Who sends

people dead fish?

The Mafia?

Alison sits at the bar, staring at her notebook, a pen held

in her hand. A WHITE RUSSIAN sits on the bar beside her.

Sidney slides onto the stool beside her. She looks up and

sees he is holding a glass bowl of water with three dead

fish in it.

60.

My God, you're like a serial

killer.

This wasn't me. (Beat) I...I laid

him to rest. Cuba I mean. I took

him over to...

I don't want to know.

Okay. (Beat) Well, I just...I

just wanted to say...about not

telling them...I really

appreciated it. It was good of

you and, and...you know...not

many people would, uh...

It's okay.

Why didn't you?

You don't need my help to screw

up here, Sidney. I mean, the only

things you make are mistakes and

stains.

Can I help you?

(following his gaze)

Just a couple of straws please.

Can I ask you something? How come

you've always got the notebook?

Is it a diary or something? Am I

in it?

61.

It's...it's a novel I'm working

on, alright?

Wow.

Go ahead. I know. I'm a walking

cliche.

No - a novel, that's...that's

pretty impressive. You're writing

it by hand?

Yeah, it...I don't know. It keeps

it separate from the magazine

work. Makes it seem special.

You're full of surprises, Sister.

So...you waiting for your

boyfriend?

Uh, yeah, so...

What's he do, the mystery guy? Is

he a hack too?

Actually he's a poet.

Really? What's he look like?

What?

Just most poets you see aren't

really good-looking, are they?

Spend their time stuck in a room,

end up looking like Golem. Is

he...?

He's very handsome, thank you.

62.

Right.

You know what I don't understand?

You're desperate to get a story

in the magazine - so why wouldn't

you play ball with Eleanor, write

the puff-piece?

I resent being bribed to gush

sycophantically about a star,

okay? I choose to gush

sycophantically.

Alison stares at Sidney trying to figure him out.

It's okay anyway. Clayton's given

me a story. I'm on my way.

Well, that's good.

Sidney smiles back at her. They look at each other...it's

almost the start of a MOMENT...

Then suddenly on the TV above the bar, a MOVIE TRAILER

begins. Distracted Sidney turns to watch - it's Sophie

Maes' new film - The Suffragette - Sophie, a glamorous

Emily Pankhurst...

Sidney looks back to Alison but she has turned away,

suddenly awkward.

Okay, well...better get

going.(Leaving) You take my

advice, you'll get yourself a

boyfriend who's going to show up

once in a while.

He leaves. Beat. Alison stares at the empty stool beside

her.

Clayton is rounding up another staff meeting. Sidney sits

trying to contain his excitement.

Which makes it...a half page

left. Lawrence? Any ideas?

63.

Yeah. Rachel Petkoff, fabulous

sixties actress, one of my all

time favourites. Just made a

wonderful movie called Five

Boroughs. I think she's poised

for a come-back and I think we

should get there first, do a

profile.

Sidney stares at him in disbelief. He looks over to Alison

who avoids his gaze.

Sounds good. Let's do it. Okay

that's it people.

Uh...Clayton?

What?

Did you read my story on Vincent

Lepak?

Clayton frowns down at some papers, feigning distraction.

What? Oh, yeah. That's...that's

not going to work.

Sidney can't believe it. Clayton gets up to leave.

CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)

Oh, and for those who haven't

heard, Alison is going to be

running the I Spy section from

now on as Lawrence here has just

gone up in the world. He is

replacing Greg Roberts as Deputy

Editor.

Lawrence smiles modestly as the room applauds. Sidney looks

like he is going to implode.

Maddox passes Sidney in the corridor. Sidney glares after

him. Suddenly...

Rachel Petkoff? One of your

favourite actresses? You'd

never fucking heard of her! That

was my idea!

Lawrence stops and turns back.

64.

So it was. You have any more good

ideas don't forget to bring them

to my new office.

He is about to walk on but remembers something.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

By the way, there've been

complaints about you skulking

around the water-cooler, trying

to talk to women. It's

inappropriate behaviour.

What? You spend half your life

chatting up the staff!

When I do it it's called

flirting. When you do it it's

called sexual harassment.

Consider this an official

warning. I won't tolerate sexist

behaviour.

He walks off. Sidney glowers after him.

Lawrence is holding a meeting in his new office - half a

dozen heads of departments sit around drinking coffee.

Lawrence sits behind his desk, enjoying his new authority.

I know that wasn't Greg's way of

working but Greg isn't deputy

editor any more. I am, and I'm

making changes.

There is a knock at the door and Sidney walks in with an

attractive BLONDE WOMAN in a long coat and dark glasses.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

What?

Uh, Lawrence? This lady's been

looking for you?

(to the woman)

Can I help you?

Are you Lawrence Maddox? The new

deputy editor?

65.

Yes?

Well, I've just come to say

congratulations on your

promotion.

Thank you. I'm sorry, you are...?

I'm your present.

The Woman produces a Beat-Box from behind her back and

switches it on. She drops her coat to reveal underwear and

stockings underneath.

Maddox stares in frozen horror as the STRIPPER dances over

to him, removing her bra.

A Very Well-Dressed Middle-Aged Woman knocks on the door

and enters.

Hey Mrs Harding.

Two Impeccably-Dressed Little Girls follow Mrs Harding into

the room.

Oh my God! So adorable!

(to the Little Girls)

And this is the Fashion

Department. [To Ingrid] Where's

Mr Maddox now?

Oh he's down the hall. Room 217.

The staff are staring transfixed as the stripper gyrates

her breasts, whirling NIPPLE TASSELS.

(with mock horror)

Uh, Lawrence? This is...this is

sort of inappropriate isn't it?

Will you please...

66.

His words are muffled by the bra the stripper drapes over

his face. Gleefully, Sidney dances in the background. He

produces a camera and starts to snap away.

Oh God, this is...this is

awful...

The Stripper, who we suddenly realise is BOB THE TRANSEXUAL

in a blonde wig, whips off his/her panties. There is a

collective gasp from the room. Sidney can't stop laughing.

Suddenly he notices everyone in the room is now staring at

the door. He turns to see Mrs Harding and her girls

standing, shell-shocked, in the doorway. Alarmed, Sidney

side-steps in towards Bob.

REVERSE - GIRLS' P.O.V

Bob, impressive breasts bared, stands staring back at us.

Sidney, in the absence of anything else to shield him with,

is HOLDING BOB'S PENIS.

The rest of the staff stare at us, rabbits caught in

headlights. After a beat Lawrence peers around Sidney, a

rictus smile on his face.

Hello, Mrs Harding. Girls...

Sidney sits waiting, obsessively cleaning his hand with a

wet-wipe. Through the glass partition we can see Clayton

and Eleanor Johnson in the office. They are apparently

discussing a mock-up of a new cover for Sharps. After a

moment Eleanor comes out of the office and sweeps past

Sidney without a glance. Clayton appears in the doorway.

Get in.

Sidney sits in front of Clayton.

I didn't know it was Take Our

Daughters To Work Day. I didn't

even know there was a Take Our

daughters To Work Day.

67.

Shut up. (Beat) You know, when I

told my wife I'd hired another

Brit, she was excited. She still

thinks you're all like something

from Pride and Prejudice. But you

Sidney ...you're like a British

person born in New Jersey.

(Shaking his head) Why did I hire

you?

I don't know - why did you hire

me?

I had an attack of nostalgia.

It's passed. Like gas.

What was wrong with my story?

What?

Why did you kill my Vincent Lepak

story?

It wasn't good enough. Plain and

simple.

It wasn't good enough?

We don't do hatchet jobs here.

It isn't a hatchet job!

This opening quotation - "It's

only too easy to catch people's

attention by doing something

worse than anyone else has dared

do it before..." Who are you

thinking of here? Vincent or

yourself?

He's a talentless, pretentious

little twat who thinks cinema

began with Tarantino and someone

needs to say it. And you told me

to do something with teeth! You

said...

68.

I'm trying to run a fucking

magazine here!

Sidney stares at him, angry and disappointed.

"A free press is the last defence

against the Tyranny of

Stupidity."

Save me your tin-pot philosophy,

okay?

It isn't mine. It's yours. First

issue of Snipe.

Oh, grow the fuck up, will ya!

You're not Robin Hood and you

never were. You bitch about

famous people for the same reason

I bitched about them. Because

they got invited to the Party and

you didn't. Well you're at the

Party now so quit bitching and do

your job! You're on your last

life here, you understand? One

more fuck up like today and

you're gone.

Won't you have to run a decision

like that past Eleanor first?

For a second Clayton looks like he might throw his ashtray

at Sidney. Then he controls himself.

Get out.

Sidney crosses to the door.

(he can't help himself)

Looks like I was too late to save

you after all.

He walks out.

Sidney walks back through the magazine's open plan area. CO-

WORKERS stop whatever they're doing and watch him pass in

silence. Then, slowly, one of them begins to CLAP.

69.

Someone else joins in. Then someone else. Soon they're all

clapping. Someone gets up on their desk, then another...

Sidney smiles faintly then...

BLINKS out of HIS DAY-DREAM.

Everyone around him is working as always, paying him no

attention.

We are TRACKING through Magazine Staff, celebrities,

politicians and children as they mill about the lawns of

the sprawling mansion, enjoying the Fourth Of July

celebrations which are in progress. Clayton greets guests -

the perfect host.

We find Sidney, wearing unfashionable shorts, socks and

shoes. He is talking to Alison.

You hired a stripper?

I didn't "hire" him. Bob did it

for a favour.

I thought you wanted to be a

success here?

I do! It's just...(ruefully) It

wasn't me. It was Clark.

Alison laughs.

The famous alter-ego? How long's

he been hanging around?

Since I was a kid. Anytime

something got broken, or the

bathroom got accidentally set on

fire - it wasn't me. It was

Clark. (Beat.) The weird thing

is, he kind of took over.

How old were you?

I don't know, twenty, twenty

one...

Alison laughs.

70.

Well, let me tell you, if only

you could get rid of that Clark,

you could be a real winner.

Clayton's not going to print

anything I write. I've been on

salary for six-months and I've

written precisely one hundred and

seventy five words. On a dollar-

per-word basis, I'm the highest

paid writer in the history of

this magazine.(Beat) He's not

going to renew my contract.

What did you expect, Sidney?

Vincent's one of Eleanor's

clients. I told you. They're

Untouchables.

I thought Clayton was different.

I really did. (Beat) The only

thing I'm good at is pissing

people off, and he won't let me

do it. (Beat) "My glory walks

hand in hand with my doom." (Off

her look) Troy

Troy who?

Troy, the movie.

Everybody hates me here. You're

the only one who'll talk to me.

You cornered me.

(a little embarrassed)

No, I mean it. You're the person

who's been most, you know...

uh...abusive to me.

You want another drink?

71.

(beat, smiling)

Alright. I'll have a beer.

Sidney walks off.

Sidney is getting a drink at the bar that has been set up

in the grounds. Suddenly he stiffens, watching as Sophie

Maes, looking spectacular, walks over to where Maddox and

his circle are talking nearby.

Sophie, my darling. Looking

ravishing as always.

Whilst the two are engaged in kissing cheeks, Sidney takes

a credit card from his wallet and drops it surreptitiously

by Sophie's feet.

You know what I read the other

day? Your collection of poems -

The Hollow Heart? Man, they're

great.

Sidney reacts to this, feeling troubled for some reason.

You write poems?

In another life.

The BARMAN is handing out drinks.

And a White Russian?

Right here.

Sidney stares at the drink, feeling like he's just been

punched in the stomach. Maddox notices him.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

Well, well, if it isn't Sidalee.

Maddox notices the card at Sophie's feet.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

(picking it up)

What's this? "Hon Young".

That's...that's mine.

72.

But your name's not "Hon".

(reaching for it)

It's short for "Honourable".

(whisking it away)

As in, "the Honourable Sidney

Young"?

Can I please...?

(holding it out of

So how come it says "Hon Young"?

They made you sound like some

Korean medical student.

They screwed it up. Please.

Sidney baby, you don't wanna go

faking a British title to impress

Sophie. It's the Fourth of July.

(Handing back the card): We're

celebrating the fact that we

threw a bunch of British

aristocrats out.

Why don't you shut up, Maddox?

Careful Sidney. Remember - if it

wasn't for us you'd all be

speaking German.

You're Canadian. If it wasn't for

us you'd be speaking French.

73.

Alison is about to walk into the bathroom when she hears

the sound of muffled sobbing and stops. She peers through

the slightly open door.

HER P.O.V - Elizabeth Maddox stands at the mirror, staring

at her reflection. For once she is not wearing her dark

glasses and we can see her eyes are red raw from crying.

Elizabeth walks out of the bathroom, dark glasses back in

place, her face a mask once more. She walks off.

Alison slips out from a nearby room and watches her go,

miserable with guilt.

Sidney is staring over to where Alison and Maddox are

standing by some trees, deep in conversation. Maddox is

tossing nuts into the air and catching them in his mouth.

(muttering to himself)

Choke. Choke.

He puts his fingers to his temples as if to channel

telekinetic powers.

Choke...choke...

Sidney realizes Harding's wife is passing with her two

daughters.

Hello, Mrs Harding. Lovely party.

With a look of alarm she shepherds the girls away. A tall

older man dressed in white with a long white beard appears

next to Sidney.

How are you?

Sidney nods gloomily.

OLDER MAN (CONT'D)

Has anyone ever told you before

that you have an unusually dark

aura?

Yup.

74.

You should walk with bare feet as

much as possible, ground all that

negative energy.

Sidney examines him.

So...you're a wizard or...?

I'm a spiritual healer.

You can make a living doing that?

Oh God no. I'm a dentist.

They stare at the party for a moment.

OLDER MAN (CONT'D)

You want to do some coke?

Um...no, thanks.

Rachel Petkoff stands talking to some other guests. Sidney

notices her and walks over.

Hey! Hello again?

Rachel smiles at him distantly, clearly not remembering

him.

Hello. (Turning back to the

others) No, Lawrence is a

wonderful writer. I really felt

like he got to the heart of me.

Sidney snorts. Rachel turns back to him, faintly irritated.

I'm sorry, have we...?

Sidney. Sidney Young. We met

at...

Another GUEST walks past Sidney and kisses Rachel.

I saw Five Boroughs the other day

and wept!

75.

Sidney hovers for a moment, ignored, and then walks away.

Dusk. The guests have gathered on the lawns to watch the

fireworks. There are oohs and aahs as the rockets light up

the sky. Suddenly...

SIDNEY (O.S.)

In-ger-lernd!

Puzzled the guests turn to where a drunk Sidney is standing

on the balustrade of the porch of the house.

In-ger-lernd! In-ger-lerrrrrrnd!

He spots HUGH GRANT amongst the crowd, watching him,

puzzled.

You! Grant! Come on! In-ger-

lerrrr...

With that he slips from the balustrade and crashes into the

shrubbery below.

Sidney limps through the trees, dabbing at a scratch on his

face. He passes Alison who is sitting on a tree-swing, lost

in thought, swigging absently from a bottle of wine.

You okay?

What?

I said are you okay?

I'm fine. Yup. Fine. (Beat) You?

Yup. (Beat) No, actually. I hate

my life so, you know, I'm gonna

get drunk.

Sidney nods, vaguely. They stand in awkward silence for a

moment. Then...

Right...See you...

He walks off. Beat. He walks back into frame suddenly.

76.

HOW COULD YOU?

What?

How the...You...having an affair

with Maddox! I mean...Maddox for

Christ's sake! The Man With

Hidden Shallows! Jesus! I mean, I

used to think you were...I was

starting to...I mean, at first I

thought you were a pain but then

I started to think...but I

mean...Maddox? How can you live

with yourself?

Alison stares at him, pale, blinking back tears.

I couldn't. That's why I've

broken up with him.

Well, that's no...that's, you

know...(Beat) You broke up with

him?

Alison walks off. Beat. She walks back.

Which leg did you hurt?

This one.

Alison kicks the leg.

OW!

She walks off again.

Sidney lies beside the pool staring darkly into the water

and nursing the beginnings of a hangover. We hear faint

music and laughter from where the party continues in the

house behind.

He notices the reflection of the starry sky in the water

and reaching out gloomily to hold one of the stars. The

reflection dissolves into ripples. When the water settles

Sophie Maes reflection stares back at him.

77.

You know what? There's something

very damaged about you.

Huh...

Like an animal that's been hit by

a car or something. Like a deer

or...like a pig maybe? When they

walk funny and the other animals

keep away from them. Little limpy

pig. I'm drawn to sick animals.

That's why I picked Cuba -

because he had like psychological

problems? (Her eyes well with

tears) Poor little Cuba. Where is

he now?

Huh...

Jesus, I'm wasted. Are you

wasted? I'm wasted.

Congratulations on becoming

incredibly famous by the way.

Thanks.

What's it like?

What's what like?

Everything.

78.

Weird. It's happening so fast

and...it's like it's got nothing

to do with me. It's like I'm not

even really here.

She laughs softly.

SOPHIE MAES (CONT'D)

Am I here?

You're here.

She turns back to look at the stars.

I'm so hungry.

Would you...would you like me to

get you some food?

Are you crazy? There might still

be a photographer around.

They lie in silence for a moment.

SOPHIE MAES (CONT'D)

You know what would be nice

though? Some coke.

She rubs her face, close to falling asleep.

SOPHIE MAES (CONT'D)

Probably just as well I haven't

got any. Coke always makes me so

horny.

Sidney opens his mouth but cannot speak.

...through the groups of people chatting outside the house.

(out of breath)

Wizard! Wizard Dentist Man! Need

Wizard Dentist Man!

Sidney has virtually dragged the Dentist out of his car. He

is handing Sidney a wrap.

79.

I will never, never, never forget

this. Thank you!

He starts to hurry away.

Alison is weaving unsteadily towards the driveway.

Sidney hurries past then slows and stops, staring back at

her.

Alison stands rooting in her purse for a tip to give the

VALET MAN who is holding open the door of her car for her,

the engine running.

What are you doing?

None of your business...

You can't drive. You need to go

and sleep this off somewhere.

Firstly, you are a stupid asshole

and I hate you and Secondly...

Secondly...

She muses on what she was going to say next. Sidney looks

over his shoulder, imagining Sophie waiting for him.

Secondly...

Yeah, okay. Listen, you try

driving in this state you're

gonna kill yourself.

Who'd care if I did?

Beat. Suddenly she bursts into tears. Surprised, Sidney

stands, uncertain what to do.

I've got to go. Got to go.

Sidney holds her to stop her falling. He stares back at the

pool and then down at Alison.

80.

Sidney is driving. Alison is still drunk.

I thought I had it all figured

out. A - get the hell out of Port

Huron, come to New York. B - do

the serious journalism thing to

pay the bills while I, you know,

write the novel. C- Win a

Pulitzer. E...

D.

D - I don't know what D was. Then

I took the internship at Sharps

and I met Maddox and he was...he

was so...and before I know it I'm

writing, you know, Ten Tips for

the fucking Metrosexual and

pretending this is what I wanted

but this ISN'T what I wanted! And

that's...that's why I hated

you...

I didn't know you hated me.

...because you were right about

me. I'm a ghoul, writing fluff!

You're not a Ghoul. You're a

Zombie.

Alison leans her head against the window.

But he isn't the person you think

he is, okay? Maddox. That's just

a front. He thinks he's let

himself down by giving up the

poetry and he's unhappy. And the

marriage is a sham, I mean... I

just...I couldn't end it. I just

couldn't and...

(can't take anymore)

Look, I don't need to hear this.

Fine.

81.

Need a cigarette. Where are my

fucking cigarettes?

You don't smoke.

Oh yeah.

Do you think I have low self-

esteem? Am I afraid of a real

relationship? Do I think an

affair is all I deserve? I mean,

okay, he's handsome and

successful and he's great in

bed...

Could you just be quiet?

When I told him I couldn't see

him any more...I don't know if he

cared. I love him and, and I

don't know if he cares!

Well, I'm...I'm sure he does.

He's probably just not very good

at expressing his emotions.

I'm so fucking sophisticated! I

mean there's not even a little

bit of Port Huron left, right?

I've got the haircut and the job

and I've got the parties and I've

even, I've even got the affair

because that's what sophisticated

fucking people do!

Alright. Alright. Don't, you

know, get snot everywhere...

Oh G-God...

82.

What?

Alison lurches down out of sight and is sick on Sidney's

shorts.

Sidney is driving through Manhattan, the windows down.

Alison is asleep.

Alison? What's your address?

(Beat. Shaking her) Alison?

Alison snores loudly. Sidney sighs.

Sidney staggers up the stairs carrying Alison over his

shoulder. Alison is moaning.

Shut up will you? You'll wake the

old witch up.

He stops suddenly and turns.

Mrs Kowalski glowers at him from the doorway. Sidney

freezes - a sickly smile on his face.

Did...Did we wake you?

OH GOD! I'M A WHORE! I'M A WHORE!

An ELDERLY MAN appears behind Mrs Kowalski staring at

Sidney. Long Beat.

Hello Dad.

Sidney, Mrs Kowalski and Sidney's father - RICHARD YOUNG -

sit drinking coffee. Richard has an absent-minded air,

wears a somewhat shabby jacket. Sidney seems to have almost

physically shrunk in the presence of his father.

Some music is playing in the next room. Alison dances

drunkenly past the doorway, wearing Sidney's jacket.

83.

(as she goes by)

Love this song...

She, uh, she isn't actually a

prostitute.

Oh good.

Sooo, Sidney's dad. Good to meet

you. I'm Alison. I'm from Port

Huron. (To Mrs Kowalski) And you

must be Sidney's mom?

No I am not!

Oh, okay. My dad married again

too, so that's cool. (To Richard)

You wanna dance?

No thank you.

Okay. Where are my cigarettes?

(feeling in the pocket of the

jacket) What is that?

Oh, hey, is that....?

I think it is probably cocaine.

It wasn't actually for me. I was

going to give it to this young

actress...

84.

So, hey, visiting your boy.

That's nice. You must be pretty

proud of him, huh?

I think you should lie down

Alison.

He's doing just great at the

magazine.

First we all thought he was kinda

creepy because he was always

hanging around the water-cooler,

hitting on women...

Really Alison, I think...

But I think that was pretty much

an act. So, Mister Sidney,

whatcha doing here?

Please, call me Richard. I've

written a little book so I'm

doing a few talks.

A book! Hey - I'm writing a book.

What's yours about? Don't tell me

- it's a thriller, right?

No, nothing so interesting I'm

afraid. I'm a philosopher.

Philosophy? Really? Have you

written any...

Oh my God...Richard? R.C. Young?

You're R.C Young? (To Sidney)

You...you didn't say...

85.

I'd love to hear what you think

of the book if you have time to

read it.

Alison snorts with laughter.

What would Sidney know about

philosophy?

Well, he does have a Masters in

the subject.

Alison stares at Sidney. She breaks into a snorting laugh

again.

You're shitting me! Sidney?

He...he likes Con Air!

She stops laughing, hit by a sudden wave of nausea.

I...I don't feel very well.

Mrs Kowalski stands up.

Come on. It is time you went to

bed. (To Sidney) You can sleep on

the couch.

Okay. Better go before I find out

something else I don't know about

Sidney.

Mrs Kowalski turns to Richard.

It was a pleasure to meet you

Lord Young.

Alison stares at Sidney who smiles weakly.

Richard and Sidney sit alone.

You should have said you were

coming.

86.

That would have required you

answering one of my calls.

I've been pretty busy.

Which reminds me, I was talking

to a publisher friend of mine the

other day. He mentioned that they

were planning a series of

introductory texts on

philosophers. I wondered if you

would be interested?

I have a job, dad.

Of course, of course. I picked up

a copy of your magazine at the

airport.

RICHARD YOUNG (CONT'D)

Most enjoyable. (Beat) I

particularly liked the young

Hollywood actress who said she'd

like to start her theatre career

"somewhere small, like London or

England."

Why've you always got to do this?

It's...it's...

It was just a joke Sidney...

Actually it's not. Because you're

saying that what I do for a

living is worthless and...

I don't think it's worthless. I

just think, in your heart, you

know you could do more with your

life than...

More? Sharps is one of the most

respected magazines in the world.

There's a million hacks who would

kill to be where I am now.

87.

You know who I interviewed

recently? Nathan Lane.

I don't know who...

I KNOW you don't know who that

is! You don't know who anyone is!

You thought Brad Pitt was a cave

in Yorkshire! But most people do

know who they are, okay? And most

people wouldn't think that a

journalist who gets to mix with

stars like that was a, a

disappointment!

I don't think you're a

disappointment Sidney. I've never

thought that.

RICHARD YOUNG (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset

you.

Things haven't really been that

great. I don't know what it is.

(Beat) I'm not... getting ahead.

If you're not happy...

No. I'm fine. I know I can make

it.

Einstein said "Try not to become

a man of success but rather to

become a man of value."

RICHARD YOUNG (CONT'D)

The young lady next door...

Alison? She wouldn't have

anything to do with your desire

to stay would she?

88.

What? No. We're just friends.

I saw the way you looked at her.

Sidney considers this, knowing it's true.

She doesn't feel that way about

me. New York women don't date

losers.

I suppose not. But Alison is from

Port Huron, isn't she?

Sidney stares at him.

Sidney peers into the room to check Alison is okay. She

lies asleep on the bed, moonlight bathing her face. She

looks beautiful.

Sidney stands staring at her for a moment and then tip-toes

back out of the room.

Sidney is cooking, humming, happy that Alison is here.

Alison walks in, feeling dreadful.

I don't remember very much but

I'm so, so sorry. I'll get myself

together and get going...

Why? No, you're all right.

It's...it's nice to have the

company.

Oh God...your father. And that

woman.

Mrs Kowalski? Don't worry about

it. The last woman she caught me

with had a penis, so you

know...you're a big step up.

Thanks.

89.

Who's that?

That's my mother.

No way!

Yeah, I don't take after her...

Was she a model?

Actress.

Wow. Movies?

Some. British, small parts...

Is she...

No, she died when I was young.

Must have been pretty cool having

your mom in the movies.

Yeah, I suppose. I used to see

her on the TV every now and then

when I was growing up. Sort of

weird.

Here we go! English fry-up.

Perfect hangover cure.

90.

Sidney is tidying. He upsets Alison's bag from the couch

and its contents spill onto the floor - the NOTEBOOK is

amongst them.

Sidney stares at it, hesitates and then, unable to resist,

opens it up and starts to read. Alison walks into the room.

Sidney looks up guiltily.

Sorry, I was just...uh...(He

can't think of an excuse)

...rooting through your private

possessions...

Alison sits on the couch, feeling too ill to be annoyed.

I like the opening.

You do?

I do. Can I read the rest of it?

Believe it or not, I'm a pretty

good editor.

I don't know. I don't even know

if I'm going to bother finishing

it.

"Keep true to the dreams of thy

youth."

Alison examines him through narrowed eyes.

Is that from Troy again?

Schiller.

She puts her things back in her bag.

I'll jump in the shower and then

I really will get out of your

hair.

Sidney watches, not wanting her to go.

Oh, I forgot...I got you a

present.

91.

He hands her a bag. Surprised she opens it and takes out a

RECORD. It's the Nino Rota sound-track to La Dolce Vita.

I was just walking past this

music shop on the corner and I

saw it. I thought it might cheer

you up.

Alison is deeply touched.

That's...I don't know what to

say. (Beat) I haven't got a

turntable.

Oh. (Beat) Well, you can always

come here to listen to it.

Sidney takes the record and puts it on the turntable in the

corner of the room. He selects the finale music - it's

funny and sad, glamorous and romantic... They listen to it

for a moment. Sidney starts to dance a little. He cha-cha's

over to her and holds out his hand.

Are you kidding? I could throw up

on you again.

C'mon...

Alison reluctantly gets up. They dance ironically. Alison

laughs a little.

Gradually they get more into it, enjoying the music - a man

in shorts and a woman in pyjamas, cha-cha-chaing, a summer

breeze wafting in the through the open windows behind

him...

Some weeks later. Alison sits at her desk, trying to work.

She looks up and catches Maddox watching her with soulful

eyes from across the room.

She looks quickly away, unsettled.

Sidney sits at his desk surreptitiously watching her,

SMITTEN.

92.

Autumn. Rain lashes against the window. Alison drinks

coffee. Ingrid and Anna are examining a rack of clothes

behind her.

Ingrid is holding up a dress.

Hey, Alice? Versace. You like?

I'm good, thanks.

Honey, everyone needs to change

their look every now and then.

Especially if they have a new man

in their life.

What are you talking about?

Sidney is just about to enter the room.

INGRID (O.S.)

Well, that English guy is always

hanging around you these days,

right?

Sidney freezes, listening.

Alison blushes fiercely.

Tell me it isn't so.

Of course not.

Thank God. Can you imagine? He's

such a creep.

Sidney listens sadly to the women laughing inside.

93.

Alison stares at the Fashionistas, annoyed by this.

Oblivious, Anna holds up some trousers against herself.

These are gorgeous, but I'm just

too fat.

Oh don't be crazy! Alice? Is Anna

fat?

Not at all. Why, she's so thin I

could just take her little

spindly body and snap it over my

knee like a dry fucking twig.

Thanks.

Oh, and for your information

Sidney Young has got more going

for him than most of the men in

this town.

She gets up to leave, the others gawping after her.

Sidney gives a slow smile of wonder - she likes him!

Suddenly he realises Alison is about to walk out the door

and catch him listening. Panicking he opens the nearest

door and runs in, falling straight down a short flight of

stairs and out of sight. Alison walks out of the room and

away, oblivious.

E.C.U - On Sidney, staring at us.

Hey Alison, I was wondering if

you wanted to...(Beat. Starting

again) Hello there. Listen I was

wondering if you wanted to see a

movie or...a meal...or...(Beat,

starting again.) Alison. You

wanna go on a date?

We see he is staring at his reflection in a mirror. He

slips in a pair of PLASTIC FANGS and smiles toothily.

94.

The SHARPS HALLOWEEN BALL is in full swing - guests dancing

in fancy dress. Sidney, dressed as Dracula, threads through

the crowd. He spots Alison on the other side of the room,

dressed as CAT WOMAN. He starts to make his way towards

her, a little nervous.

He passes ELEANOR JOHNSON and VINCENT LEPAK. Vincent wears

all black and his shades.

I like your costume Vincent.

I'm not wearing a costume.

Oh.

They walk on.

Idiot.

Wanker.

Sidney continues through the crowd to Alison. He puts his

Dracula TEETH in.

Haven't we met somewhere before?

That's why I don't go there any

more.

They smile, but Alison seems a little nervous.

I've been looking for you

actually. There's, uh, there's

something I need to...

(Mumbling through his

Me first. Listen I was wondering

if you want to go to the movies

or maybe for a, uh....

What? I can't understand what

you're saying.

95.

Sidney pulls the plastic fangs out.

Sorry. I was just saying...

Maddox appears and gives Alison a glass of champagne. He

kisses her.

Back in a minute.

He walks off again. Sidney stares dumbly after him.

I wanted to tell you. Lawrence

has left his wife. We're going to

be together. Officially.

She watches for Sidney's reaction.

Well...that's...that's brilliant.

Yeah, so...maybe he does care

after all, right?

Yup.

They stand in an awkward silence, watching the party.

A dejected Sidney stands washing his hands. Maddox walks in

behind him.

Hello Sidney. Someone said you'd

come as a Count but I thought I'd

misheard.

Sidney doesn't answer, turns to leave.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

So Alison told you we were

getting together right?

Yeah.

Yeah. Should have done it long

ago but, you know me - just not

very good at expressing my

emotions. Right?

96.

He watches Sidney's reaction, smirking.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

You must be happy for her, what

with you being friends...

Sidney blushes.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

Oh Sidalee...I thought as much.

Did you really think you and

Alison...? Things really haven't

worked out too well for you here,

have they? Ah, well. You gave it

your best shot.

He walks out. Sidney stares after him, burning.

Rain pours down. Eleanor and Vincent climb into a limousine

and close the door. Sidney runs up.

Wait! Eleanor wait!

The window glides down.

Yes?

Let me do the profile on Vincent.

I don't think so.

The window begins to slide up. Sidney hangs onto it.

You get full copy approval. It'll

be like you've written it!

The window stops. Eleanor stares at him, considering.

Sidney looks past her to Vincent.

Vincent - think about it, think

how humiliating it will be for

me. I'm begging you.

Vincent leans over, stares over his shades at Sidney.

97.

(Beat, enjoying this)

You don't look like you're

begging.

Beat. Sidney kneels down on the side-walk beside the

limousine. The rain pours down on him. The limousine drives

away. Sidney stares dumbly up at something across the

street.

On the building across the street is an ENORMOUS ANIMATED

BILLBOARD L'OREAL ADVERTISEMENT - SOPHIE MAES, in a gold

ball-gown and make-up, hair coiffured in classic forties

Hollywood style. As we watch she BLOWS US A KISS.

Underneath is the slogan - I'm Here...

Sidney sits in front of Clayton.

Lawrence Maddox is no longer

working for Sharps. Seems

Elizabeth got sick of him

screwing around and kicked him

out.

She kicked him out?

Richard Heywood doesn't seem to

like the idea of employing an ex-

son-in-law. So he's gone. So's

Alison Olsen.

Sidney stares at him.

CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)

Don't worry about Maddox. He's

already lined up something with

Gotham Magazine. I'm gonna need

someone to hold the fort at I

Spy. Strictly on a temporary

basis, you understand? One more

thing. Eleanor Johnson rang this

morning, wondering if you'd like

to write a profile on Vincent

Lepak.

Sidney stares at him.

CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D)

I don't know how you did it but

somehow you've made it into the

next room.

98.

We hear the opening of Pretty Vacant by the Sex Pistols as

we...

As the song continues we see Sidney interviewing Vincent,

complete with shades.

Vincent is wearing a crown, being photographed on a throne.

Sidney and Eleanor are watching.

Eleanor is going through Sidney's copy, crossing lines out

with a red pen. Sidney watches.

Sidney, Eleanor and a Photo-Editor are looking at the

photos from the shoot. Eleanor is pointing out a blemish on

Vincent's face.

...as we watch the blemish disappears.

Sidney buys a copy of Sharps and flicks through it until he

finds what he's looking for - a four page feature entitled

Vincent Lepak - Long Live The King.

He stares at his byline at the top of the feature.

An elegant apartment building.

Sidney is being shown around a chic apartment by a Realtor.

99.

Sidney is amongst the room full of writers and editors,

pitching to Clayton who nods approval and passes on to the

next item.

Sidney and Eleanor are talking with an ACTOR. Sidney is

wearing a smart suit, fawning in a suitably restrained

manner.

Sidney is interviewing the Actor, laughing sycophantically

at something he has just said.

Sidney sits at his desk, looking very much the part now in

another expensive suit, talking on the phone. His desk is

crowded with MUFFIN BASKETS. A COURIER is handing over a

GIFT-WRAPPED BOX to him. Sidney opens the box to reveal a

ROLEX SEA-DWELLER 4000 WATCH. Sidney stares at the watch.

Sidney is drinking champagne amongst the Glitterati,

talking to a Producer. Simon Cowell walks past and high-

fives him. Sidney throws back his head, laughing at

something the Producer said.

Sidney sits in the steam room, wrapped in a towel,

sweating. Slowly the steam envelops him until he has

disappeared.

END OF MONTAGE

CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S PHOTOGRAPH - looking as cool as he can.

Alison sits alone reading Sharps, staring at Sidney's photo

in the "Notes on Contributors" page. She smiles, then

glances up, her smile fading. Maddox is walking towards

her, drunk and sour faced.

(noticing the magazine)

Well, well...little Sidalee. I

feel like a proud Papa.

100.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

Listen, I can't stay. Anderson

wants me to go to some

photographers exhibition. Hot new

talent blah, blah...

Right. (Beat) How hot is she?

Who?

The new talent?

Do you think you could drop the

little wife routine? It's kind of

in bad taste.

Alison stares at him sadly

I guess you're right.(Quietly)

What goes around comes around.

Maddox is about to say something but changes his mind.

I'll see you back home.

He is about to leave when he notices Alison's notebook on

the table.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

And will you stop carrying that

thing around with you? It's kind

of embarrassing.

He walks off.

Sidney is with Eleanor and Sophie, who now looks every inch

the movie star.

Sophie's going to get a Golden

Globe nomination for best

actress.

Wow. That's fantastic.(Beat)

But...the nominations haven't

been announced yet?

101.

That is correct so we have

absolutely no way of knowing

whether or not she will be

nominated. (Beat) So, if she is

nominated we want Sharps to do a

feature. Someone to cover the

whole lead up, unrestricted

access, the trajectory, the

building of this unique brand.

I'm going to have a logo.

Here's the deal. Sophie wants you

to do it.

Sidney stares at her and then at Sophie, stunned.

You can be my bitch.

Merry Christmas, Sidney. This is

a cover story. I think a little

celebration is in order.

Snow falls. Sidney climbs out of a limousine with Eleanor

and Sophie.

The women breeze past the Doorman and into the club. Sidney

hesitates on the thresh-hold, staring up at the sign above

him as if it's a magic portal.

Sidney walks in.

A surprisingly small, ultra A-list club, chic and ironic

Christmas decorations.

Sidney walks past celebrities and beautiful people. He's

arrived.

Sidney stands with Kevin Bacon playing Six Degrees of Kevin

Bacon. People stand around watching.

Okay, uh...Clark Gable. Go!

102.

Clark Gable to Vivien Leigh (Gone

With The Wind), Vivien Leigh to

Marlon Brando (Street Car Named

Desire), Marlon Brando to Robert

DeNiro (The Score) Robert De Niro

to Kevin Bacon (Sleepers)!

The crowd cheers.

A very drunk Sidney stands in a toilet cubicle with a YOUNG

ACTRESS doing coke.

Sexiest philosopher?

Uh, tricky, but I'm gonna say

Nietzsche. Huge moustache. The

Tom Selleck of Nihilism.

Um...most evil philosopher.

Okay. Good. Evil genius

philosopher...Hobbes, proto-Nazi,

Heidegger - actual Nazi, Hegel -

twat. Basically your H's...

Most Hollywood philosopher?

Uh...Bishop Berkely.

What'd he say?

Esse est percipi.

What does that mean?

If they `aint looking at you, you

don't really exist.

Oh honey, tell me something I

don't know...

Sidney stoops and snorts a line of coke.

103.

Sidney, giddy on champagne, coke and success is dancing

with Sophie. He's at the centre of the world.

The doorbell rings. Sidney wearing a silk dressing gown

wanders through the room from the bedroom and opens the

door.

Alison stands outside, smiling at him.

Hey.

Hey.

Nice robe.

Thanks. It was a gift. Ralph

Lauren.

Who from?

Ralph Lauren. I did a piece.

Beat. He still hasn't invited her in.

I just wanted to say I heard

about you getting the promotion.

Congratulations. I'm happy for

you.

Thanks. How's things with you

and...

Good. Fine. Everything's

...uh...I'm working for this

little literary magazine. It's

not the New Yorker but...

(awkward) So, I've left you a

bunch of messages...

Yeah. I've been pretty busy.

104.

I thought so.

Okay, well...

How's the novel coming along?

Oh, well...still working on it.

Well...keep at it. I believe in

you.

I never gave you these.

You know...

Sidney?

(a little wave)

Hey, Alice.

(half joking, half

How did it all go so wrong?

FADE OUT.

105.

Sophie and her entourage, including Sidney and Eleanor,

climb out of a line of limousines and walk into the Hotel.

Sidney stands for a moment, looking around him. Hollywood.

He's finally here.

We hear the opening of Virgina Plain by Roxy Music.

We are swooping in towards the hotel and an enormous

BILLBOARD ADVERTISEMENT for Sophie's new film - in pre-

production. It's a re-make of Singing In The Rain - with

Russel Crowe.

We BOOM down from Sophie's fifteen foot laughing face to

find Sidney standing on a slim ledge outside his hotel

window. He is drunk and wearing only his underwear. He is

also yelling with fear.

The window behind him is crowded with people shrieking with

laughter.

Gingerly he edges back to the window and climbs back

into...

It's a wild party. Music is blaring, people are dancing,

drinking, laughing.

You didn't do it!

High.

You let me down!

Too high! You couldn't do it. Too

high.

Sophie calmly unzips her dress and steps out of it,

standing in her underwear. There is applause from the on-

lookers. Calmly she steps out of the window onto the ledge

and disappears from sight.

The on-lookers crane out of the window, yelling

encouragement.

After a moment Sophie appears at another window further

along the wall and climbs back into the room to ecstatic

applause. She stares imperiously at Sidney.

106.

What are you?

Your limpy pig.

What?

I'm your limpy pig!

That's right! Okay, limpy pig.

You need to pay a forfeit.

Whatcha got?

I've got my little limpy dance.

Sidney dances a little, jiggling up and down.

Give me your ring.

Sidney stops dancing, his smile fading a little.

I...I can't...

Give me the ring. I want it.

I can't.

Sophie stares at him through narrowed eyes.

Okay, give me the ring and if I

win tomorrow, I'll let you have

sex with me.

The on-lookers shriek with delight.

Sidney stares at her. He looks past her to his reflection

in the window - a drunk man in his underwear, swaying from

side to side...

Sidney is back in his own room, alone, a mess. He sits on

the floor chopping lines of coke on the coffee table. He

stares groggily at the space on his finger where his ring

used to be.

107.

(muttering to himself)

You're a star. You're a big,

bright shining star...

He snorts a line and, leaning back, flicks blankly through

TV channels - a sports programme, a news station, a sit-com

re-run...

He snorts another line, flicks stations - more sports, a

music video, a black and white movie...

Sidney stops, staring at the screen...

TV SCREEN - we're watching the fifties British movie we saw

at the beginning of the film. Sidney's MOTHER is typing at

the desk in the background. She gets up from the desk and

walks into another office.

Sidney stares, frozen.

Sidney's mother passes the LEAD ACTRESS who is staring out

of the window, smoking. She stares at her sympathetically.

(Celia Johnson accent)

Don't worry Mary...you'll meet

him one day.

How will I know when I do?

Oh, when you meet the One, you'll

know...

She walks on.

Sidney stares at the screen.

A conveyor belt of limousines arriving outside the Hilton.

Rain falls. Celebrities wave to the watching crowds as they

make their way up the red carpet, cameras flash...

Sophie emerges from a limo, looking amazing. SHE IS WEARING

A FUR WRAP. She makes her way up the carpet, Sidney walks

behind, smiling vaguely...

Various celebrities are being interviewed. Sidney stands a

little apart, lost in thought.

Well, well... Look at you...

108.

Lawrence Maddox stands beside him, something nervous in his

manner now, the old confidence gone. He has been drinking.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

Made it all the way to the

Seventh Room.

He holds out his hand.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

Congratulations. The wheel of

fortune right? You go up, I go

down. You're here with Sophie?

How about doing your old Rabbi a

favour and putting in a good word

for me? Maybe a little interview?

Sidney absent-mindedly takes his hand, looking past him.

Is Alison here?

Alison? No, we went our separate

ways. Actually she left me. Tells

me she's in love with someone

else.

Sidney stares at him.

LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)

Nope, not you I'm afraid Sidalee.

She threw us both over. Some guy

named Clark. I mean...Clark. Can

you believe it? But these are the

sacrifices we make, right? I

don't need to tell you. It's not

a vacation. It's a vocation. So

listen, about Sophie...

But Sidney is no longer listening.

SLOW MOTION - we move in on Sidney, sitting at the table,

listening to the Best Actress award. This is where we first

met him.

SIDNEY (V.O.)

This is me at the Golden Globes.

That's my Armani tuxedo. That's a

Rolex Sea-Dweller 4000 watch I'm

wearing. I'm inside. I'm at the

centre of everything. I'm right

where I wanted to be.

Beside him Sophie covers her face with her hands and starts

to stand, having just won Best Actress.

109.

Sidney stares at her hands - she is wearing his gold ring.

We move back into real time, sound swells up, thunderous

applause. Sidney claps along with the others.

Then he stands up and goes after Sophie.

(taking her arm)

I need my ring back.

Sophie turns back to him, her smile fixed.

I need my ring back.

As if puzzled by her inability to make it to the stage,

Sophie, still smiling, tries to pull her arm free. Eleanor

is instantly beside them, trying to disengage Sidney's

hand.

(smiling, hissing)

What are you doing? Let her go!

She isn't the One. My mother gave

me that ring and told me I had to

give it to the One. She isn't the

One.

The applause is still going strong. TV Cameras move in on

Sophie as she starts to struggle, her smile slipping.

Sidney tries to pull the ring free from her finger.

Officials move in.

What the fuck are you doing?

Just...Will you...I don't want to

be on the inside. I don't want to

be at the Party. I don't want to

have have sex with you. (Beat) I

KILLED CUBA!

Sophie stares at him for a moment then with a shriek

launches herself at him. They tumble backwards.

The Officials rush upon them. There are gasps from the

other tables, people standing up to see what's going on.

Mrs Kowalski sits watching the pandemonium on TV.

110.

SOPHIE MAES (O.S.)

(on the TV)

You fucking mother-fucking

fucker!

Soddom and Gomarrah.

The Sharps Fashionistas are gathered watching the awards on

TV in silent horror.

Sophie kicks out at Sidney, ripping her dress in the

process.

Oh God no...not the Versace...

Security pile on Sidney...

Richard Young sits watching the awards on TV. He gives a

small smile.

Alison sits watching on a TV in the corner of the bar.

ELEANOR JOHNSON (O.S.)

(On TV - losing it)

You're finished! You're finished!

Alison begins to smile.

Sidney bursts free from the scrum of Security and begins to

run across the room, overturning a table in the process,

Officials racing after him.

Sidney sprints for the doors. He notices Vincent Lepak's

startled face as he passes it. He stops, ducks back and

slaps the back of Vincent's head, knocking the SHADES onto

the floor. Sidney stamps on them and runs on. Vincent gapes

after him.

111.

...watching from his table as the people around him stand

up to see the chase. He shakes his head in horror and then

tries, and fails, to restrain a sudden bark of laughter...

Sidney bursts out of the hotel onto the red carpet and is

momentarily stopped by the sight of the massed PAPARAZZI

ahead, behind the red rope. The Paparazzi stare back at

Sidney - his face bruised, shirt collar ripped - equally

nonplussed. There is a frozen moment then Sidney plunges

forward, ducking under the red rope, back amongst his own

kind, pushing through them until he disappears amongst the

crowd.

Sidney stands at the desk.

The next available flight is ten

am sir. Gets you into New York

six thirty PM.

Sidney sighs.

Sidney sits in the almost deserted terminal waiting for the

flight back to New York. He is still wearing his

dishevelled tux. He looks down at his tightly clenched hand

and slowly opens his fingers to reveal his RING.

Sidney is in a cab, still wearing his tux, his travel bag

slung over shoulder. He stares out as the cab passes the

entrance to a PARK. A sign advertises an outdoor screening

of La Dolce Vita.

Stop the car!

An outdoor CINEMA has been set up. LA DOLCE VITA is playing

on a large screen. A crowd sits around the park, watching

the movie.

Sidney stands scanning the crowd. He locates Alison sitting

near the back.

112.

How's the novel?

Finished.

CUT TO BLACK:
