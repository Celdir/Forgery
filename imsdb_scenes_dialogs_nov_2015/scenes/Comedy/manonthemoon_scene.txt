Man on the Moon

FADE IN:

INT. VOID - DAY

Standing in a nonexistent set is ANDY KAUFMAN, looking a bit

nervous.  Wide-eyed, tentative, he stares at us with a

needy, unsettling cuteness.  His hair is slicked-down, and

he wears the "FRIENDLY WORLD" costume from the Andy Kaufman

special.

Finally, Andy speaks -- in a peculiar FOREIGN ACCENT.

Andy puts a needle on a phonograph, and swelling CLOSING

CREDITS MUSIC starts to play.  FINAL CREDITS roll.

Andy stands frozen, awkwardly looking at the audience.

Every time the music ends he picks up the needle and

restarts the music.  He does that as many times as the

credits require.

Finally, CREDITS END.  And then--a sly smile.  He leans in.

DROPS HIS ACCENT and WHISPERS.

Andy turns to a primitive 16mm PROJECTOR and turns it on.

WHIR!  He smiles at the flickering light.

We PUSH INTO the white light.  It fills our frame, blazing

whiter, whiter...

EXT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - 1957 - DAY

A BLACK AND WHITE image slowly becomes COLOR.  Great Neck,

1957.  An upper-class Jewish neighborhood.  In the street,

crewcut BOYS play t-ball, laughing and shouting.  A fat

convertible pulls up to the smallest house, and STANLEY

KAUFMAN, 40, gets out.  Still in his suit, he's a well-

meaning slave to his job -- tired, responsible.

Stanley goes over to admire the t-ball game.  At bat is his

son MICHAEL, 6, a natural charmer.  Michael swings -- crack!

-- and hits a solid single.  Stanley smiles.

Instantly -- Stanley's mood turns black.  He frowns angrily,

then snatches his briefcase and marches in.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, KITCHEN - 1957 - DAY

Baby CAROL is crying.  Mom JANICE, 35, quickly peels

carrots, trying to get dinner made.  Stanley marches past.

Stanley glowers.  He huffs upstairs.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, HALLWAY - 1957 - DAY

Stanley hurries up to Andy's shut door.  We hear little Andy

doing VOICES.

Stanley rolls his eyes.  He opens the door...

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY

...revealing ANDY, 8, performing for the wall.  Andy is

happy and enthusiastic... as long as he's acting.

The boy suddenly turns off, becoming introverted... awkward.

Frustrated, Stanley stares at his son.

Andy glances over at the wall.  Hmm.

Andy thinks, considering his options.  Then, he nods.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - 1957 - LATER THAT DAY

Baby Carol sits in her crib.  Andy's hands suddenly YANK her

out.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY

Andy hurries in and plops Carol down on the floor.  She

dutifully sits there, deadpan.

Andy returns to the center of the room.  He resumes his

show.

Carol stares, unblinking.  Then --

INT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - NIGHT

TIGHT on ANDY, now GROWN UP.  26-years-old, still performing

the song.

WIDE - It's a small, hip New York nightclub.

Andy waves and bows.  There's faint scattered applause.

Andy sighs.  An irritated MANAGER steps onstage.  He shoots

Andy a disgruntled look, then takes the mike.

In the b.g., Andy starts packing up his props: Hand puppets,

conga drums, a phonograph... it all goes into a big bulky

case.

INT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - LATER THAT NIGHT

The club is empty.  At the bar, the manager cleans up.  Andy

eagerly comes over.  Offstage, his presence is soft, placid

-- his voice barely above a whisper.

A stunned beat.  Andy is hurt.

Andy stares, disheartened.

An uncomfortable beat -- and then Andy starts crying.

The manager is dumbfounded.  He doesn't know what to do.

Tears are rolling pitifully down Andy's cheeks.  The manager

is confused -- totally disoriented.  Shamed, Andy covers his

face, then runs out.  Silence.  The manager stares after

him... having no idea what just happened.

EXT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - NIGHT

Sobbing Andy bursts out the door.  He steps onto the

sidewalk -- and IMMEDIATELY STOPS CRYING.  Just like that.

Andy lifts his big case and starts walking.  Andy shakes his

head angrily.

He turns down a dark street, hurrying alone through an

unsavory New York neighborhood.  But then... TWO MEN

appear... silently approaching.  Andy stops uncertainly --

debating whether to turn around.  But in that second -- the

thugs are upon him, glaring menacingly.

Andy stares fearfully.  An anxious moment.  He thinks...

considering his options.

Then, he suddenly stammers in a thick FOREIGN ACCENT.

The thugs glance at each other.

The guy snatches the case.  He impulsively BREAKS the

lock... and clothes, congas and records fall out.

The thugs are dismayed.

Harsh glances.  They angrily turn and leave.

Andy takes a nervous breath, then starts picking his things

off the street.  He shouts after the guys:

EXT. NY IMPROV - 1975 - NIGHT

The Improv, the biggest comedy club around.  People are

lined up, waiting.  The man strides up -- GEORGE SHAPIRO, a

Hollywood talent manager.  George is old school: Bronx

accent, shmooze and a hug... but with a surprising sweetness

that is quite disarming.  A DOORMAN sees him, grins, and

waves George in.

INT. NY IMPROV, BAR - 1975 - NIGHT

The bar is packed with COMICS and SHOW BIZ TYPES.  A few

turn and smile -- "George!"  "Hey, George!"  George takes a

couple hands, whispers to someone else, then drifts into

the...

INT. NY IMPROV, SHOWROOM - 1975 - NIGHT

Where the show's in progress.  Owner BUDD FRIEDMAN sees

George and gives him a bear-hug.  Then he hustles George to

a table.

George sits -- and gives the stage his undivided attention.

Up there is a WISEASS COMIC.

The comic waves and exits.  APPLAUSE.  George politely

claps.  A PIANO PLAYER jumps in with an upbeat show tune.

We think there's a break... when Andy suddenly, awkwardly

steps on stage.  He is in character as Foreign Man.  Pink

jacket, tie, hair slicked back, frightened like a deer in

headlights.  He puts down his big case, pulls out various

junk, and arranges it on chairs.

The room hushes, uncertain as to who the hell this guy is.

Andy tentatively grabs the mike.  The stagefright is agony.

Andy chuckles, as if this were a punchline.

Silence.  The crowd is baffled.

Yikes.  A few NERVOUS LAUGHS.

Andy gestures, as if they got the joke.

People are embarrassed.  Some avert their eyes.  A couple

hipsters laugh mockingly.

George leans forward.  Andy wipes the sweat from his brow.

Some people BOO and walk out.  A few giggle, getting into

the groove.

George is intrigued.

A woman LAUGHS caustically.  Andy grins stupidly, then turns

his back to us.  He presses "Play" on a CASSETTE RECORDER...

and the THEME FROM 2001 starts playing.

House lights dim dramatically.  With a flourish, Andy pulls

tape off his pants -- revealing rhinestones.  He removes his

pink coat -- putting on a white jeweled jacket.

He combs his hair.

Then he brushes his hair.

Then he combs his hair some more.

Finally he picks up a guitar, strikes a pose -- and spins

around.

He is ELVIS.  CONFIDENT.  SEXY.  LIP CURL.  DEAD-ON PERFECT.

The crowd is blown away.

Vegas Elvis INTRO MUSIC suddenly blasts.  Andy/Elvis

swaggers stage left and takes a bow.  Then he goes stage

right and takes a bow.  Then he returns stage left for

another bow.

Music STOPS.

Wow.  Flabbergasted, people APPLAUD.  This man is Elvis.

Suddenly -- "JAILHOUSE ROCK" guitar kicks in.

ANGLE - GEORGE

He is astonished.  George cannot quite figure out what's

going on... but he wants in.

He waves Budd over.  Budd leans down, and George WHISPERS.

George nods admiringly.

INT. NY IMPROV, BACKSTAGE - 1975 - LATER THAT NIGHT

Andy is packing up his things.  He very methodically folds

each item of clothing, then checks the creases.

George strolls up.

George is puzzled.

George hands him a BUSINESS CARD.  Andy reads it -- then his

eyes pop.  He DROPS the accent.

George realizes it's all been an act.  He laughs heartily.

INT. SOHO HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A Bohemian health food restaurant, staffed by hippie

waitresses in sandals.  Andy and George sit together, trying

to get a sense of each other.

George is surprised at this hubris.

George looks up at Andy -- and inexplicably there is a giant

MOIST BOOGER hanging from Andy's nostril.

George cringes.  He doesn't know what to say.

A waitress brings over two plates of awful 70's HEALTH FOOD

-- seaweed, beans, stringy paste.  George frowns.  Andy

beams.

Andy pulls out a little Handi-wipe and cleanses his hands.

Then he starts arranging the food in compulsive little

piles: Beans in pinwheel shapes.  Sprouts in piles.

George peers at the bizarre food behavior.

George is unsure if that's a joke.

Andy dips his silverware in the water glass.  Two dunks,

then he dries it with his napkin.

George stares, perplexed.  He looks back up -- and Andy's

booger has suddenly switched nostrils.

Huh?

Andy's about to eat -- but first bows his head in silent

prayer.  George raises an eyebrow.  Andy snaps his head back

up.

Andy triumphantly eats a bean.  George peers, unable to take

the booger anymore.  He hands Andy a napkin and points to

his nose.  Andy nods, removes the rubber booger, and

carefully puts it in a little box.

And at that... George is won over.  He smiles broadly.

George warmly extends his hand.

Andy slowly smiles, then takes George's hand.  The men

shake.  A moment of supreme importance.

EST. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

The glitz strip of Los Angeles.  Money.  Beauty.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

Real working showbiz offices.  No glamour at all.  It looks

more like an insurance agency.

George sits in his office, reassuring someone on the phone.

O.S., a SECRETARY shouts out.

On the phone, a STACCATO, ABRASIVE NASAL VOICE blares.

George is baffled.

CLICK.  Clifton hangs up.  George is bewildered.

INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CLASSROOM - DAY

The light is magical.  Soothing SITAR music plays.  Andy and

fifteen other BAREFOOT STUDENTS sit on mats in a semi-

circle.  Eyes shut, bodies in different yoga positions, they

are all meditating.

Facing them on a throne-like chair sits a reverent, Indian

YOGI.  At his feet is the class teacher, LITTLE WENDY, a

teeny lady with an absurdly high-pitched voice.

The students all open their eyes.

The Yogi's eyes go to Andy.  Andy smiles sweetly.

The Yogi nods kindly.

Oh.  The Yogi peers intently.

Andy smiles beatifically.  This means a lot.

Huh?  The Yogi thinks hard... squinching up his face.

Then... he finally speaks.

INT. SNL SET - NIGHT

An AUDIENCE sits, waiting for the commercial to end.

TECHIES tweak lights.  CAMERAMEN get ready.

Sitting in VIP seats are Andy's FAMILY.  Stanley and Janice

are in their late 50's, Michael and Carol in their 20's.

They're all anxious.

The commercial ends, and the "APPLAUSE" sign blinks.  The

crowd APPLAUDS.  An "ON THE AIR" sign lights up.

The SNL orchestra starts the intro into a song.  Andy enters

the stage with a boom box, and positions himself in front of

the microphone.  When the vocals are supposed to start, Andy

doesn't open his mouth.  Instead he looks around --

frightened.  The band stops... and starts again.  Andy

remains mute.  The Band stops again.

INT. SNL SET, BOOTH - NIGHT

The SNL producer, LORNE MICHAELS, looks worried.

INT. SNL SET - NIGHT

At that moment, Andy puts the boom box down and blares it

loudly.  The THEME FROM "MIGHTY MOUSE" plays -- but Andy

just blankly stands there.

He's purposefully doing nothing.

The audience is puzzled.  The Kaufmans are alarmed.

INT. SNL SET, BOOTH - NIGHT

Lorne Michaels is panicked.

INT. SNL SET - NIGHT

BACK ON ANDY.

Then SUDDENLY -- Andy comes to life and triumphantly LIP

SYNCS.

Shocked, the crowd HOWLS with LAUGHTER.

Then instantly -- Andy resumes his blank expression.

The audience SCREAMS with glee.  The tune ENDS, and the

audience APPLAUDS CRAZILY.

Delighted, Andy grins and bows.

The Kaufmans clap the hardest.  Stanley locks eyes with

Andy... and the beaming father smiles the proudest of all.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

George jumps from his desk.  Andy is walking in.

Andy's smile drops.  He freezes up.

Long pause.  Then -- Andy responds.

George is flummoxed.

Beat.  George glares.

Long pause.  Andy stares at George, amazed at this passion.

Then Andy gets up and looks around the office.  He stares at

the awards... the gold records... emblems of success and

experience.

Andy thinks -- then nods.

Andy starts to write on a piece of paper.

George watches patiently.

Andy clicks his pen, done.  George smiles and takes the

list.  He scans it... then his face gets totally befuddled.

George gets a look.

Andy smiles ingenuously, then turns stern.

George winces.  He stares at the list.

INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY

George sits across a conference table from three NETWORK

SUITS.  He stoically reads the men his demands.

The execs are stupefied.  Finally -- George delivers the

clincher.

Long pause.  The execs stare at George like he's lost his

mind.

The execs' leader, MAYNARD SMITH, shudders hopelessly.

George slowly, sadly shakes his head:  No.

Maynard glances at his team -- then frowns.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

GEORGE throws his attach case on the desk, then slumps into

his chair.  He picks up the phone and dials.

INT. MAMA ROMA'S - NIGHT

Mama Roma's, a dark Italian restaurant with red booths, wise

guys, and cigarette smoke.

The Maitre'd guides George to a booth.  A small BAND fills

the "stage" -- a six-foot space in the back of the room.

The lights dim.  A BLARING ANNOUNCER speaks.

George is skeptical.

The DRUMMER starts a drum roll.  Patrons APPLAUD.  A LIGHT

SPOT hits the entrance area... and nobody enters.  The spot

is waiting... waiting... still waiting... until the drum

roll slows down and stops.  The announcer BOOMS again.

The crowd GRUMBLES angrily -- then irritably complies.  One

ANGRY GUY thrusts his cigar into a water glass.

The band starts playing lounge standard "VOLARE".  And then,

obnoxious TONY CLIFTON swaggers out.  Tony has a rubbery

face, black wig and moustache, sunglasses, a padded belly,

and a peach tuxedo with blue shirt and velvet piping.

Tony stops, smirks at the audience, and sucks on a

cigarette.  He blows smoke rings at them.

The crowd is furious.

People light back up and start talking.  Tony ignores the

ruckus.  He starts SINGING, pinched and off-key.

George winces.  He's horrible.

The band is lost.

The band gives up and stops.

One person CLAPS.  Most BOO.

Tony approaches a LONELY SAD SACK sitting at the bar.  Tony

thrusts his mike at the guy.

Tony gets indignant.

People are embarrassed.

Tony snatches Bob's water glass and POURS IT over his head!

George is appalled.  The crowd is aghast.  Bob is wet.

People BOO AND HURL THINGS.

Bob starts weeping, then bolts up and runs from the

building.

The room erupts, outraged.  George covers his face, looking

ill.  Suddenly, Tony snaps at him.

George is rattled.

INT. MAMA ROMA'S, KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

The kitchen staff is working.  George wanders around... then

finally spots Tony, back to us, eating pasta at the

employees' table.  Aggravated, George aggressively steps up.

Tony puts down his fork.  He pauses... slowly turns

around... and is Andy.

George GASPS.  His eyes bulge.

Andy smiles innocently.  He gestures to an empty seat.

George is breathing heavily, like someone about to have a

heart attack.  His brain melting, he shakily reaches for a

chair and sits.  George glances down.  Lying alongside the

food is Tony's rubber face.

Beat -- then Bob strolls over.  His real name is BOB ZMUDA.

George gapes.  On closer inspection, Bob is cocky, aloof,

and conniving.  He and Andy grin naughtily at each other.

George thinks about this -- then laughs.

INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY

Maynard and the ABC suits sit at the table, mesmerized.

George is confidentially whispering to them.

Maynard thinks about this, quite methodically.  A beat, and

then he cracks a smile...

INT. ALPHA BETA SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

1 a.m. in the supermarket.  Just a few people linger...

including Andy, who's at the Space Invaders videogame.  Andy

stares intently at the screen, eyes piercing, fingers

hammering the buttons while he blows up Martians.  Andy is

oblivious to all around him.

In the b.g., George suddenly enters.  He looks around the

market, then spots Andy.  He feverishly runs up.

George grins crazily, ecstatically.

Whoa.  Andy looks up, astonished.  His space station

EXPLODES, but he doesn't notice.  He turns to George... and

slowly smiles sweetly.  Genuinely.

INT. TAXI SET - DAY

The first week of "TAXI."  The CAST rehearses on the Taxi

set.  PRODUCERS watch from the bleachers.

(The actual TAXI scene will be determined.)  JUDD HIRSCH,

TONY DANZA, and MARILU HENNER read their lines.

Then... a bored BLACK STAND-IN reads Latka's line.

The cast glances around.  Tony Danza loses his temper.

One producer stands.  This is tightly-wound ED WEINBERGER.

An angry beat.  The actors resume...

INT. TAXI SET - DAYS LATER

The AUDIENCE is filtering in.  They fill the studio

bleachers.

INT. TAXI SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY

Actors mingle outside the dressing rooms.

Judd is surprised.

INT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

Andy is meditating.  He's tranquil, at total inner peace.

Silence -- until a little clock radio CHIRPS.

Andy snaps his eyes open.  He exhales a few calm breaths,

then sits upright.  Andy reaches for a sealed envelope, rips

it open, and removes a SCRIPT.

Andy sighs, opens the script, and starts scanning the pages

like a speedreader.

INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY

Bleachers are full.  They're now filming TAXI (the same

scene as earlier).  On cue, Andy enters as LATKA -- wide-

eyed, endearing, in mechanic's overalls.

Andy is hilarious.  The crowd HOWLS with laughter.

MONTAGE - TAXI

In quick succession, a series of Andy's best Latka moments.

He's beloved.  The applause grows louder, louder, LOUDER...

INT. TAXI SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY

TAXI curtain calls.  The whole cast takes bows, then runs

offstage.  Everyone is grinning -- except Andy.

He soberly strolls up to Zmuda.

Hmm?!  Andy raises an eyebrow.

INT. MAYNARD SMITH'S OFFICE - LA - DAY

The power office of Maynard Smith, the powerful ABC exec.

He shouts into a phone.

He HANGS up.  His ASSISTANT peeks her head in.

Maynard is baffled.

INT. "KAUFMAN SPECIAL" SET, TECH BOOTH - SAME TIME

Andy is in a booth, arguing with a HEAVYSET TECHNICIAN.

Zmuda watches and eats a banana.

Maynard strolls up, buttoning his suit jacket, irritated as

he walks around Little Wendy meditating in front of a ring

of candles.

Maynard doesn't exactly understand.

The technician pushes a button.  ON THE MONITOR - Andy's

image briefly appears.

At that moment, Andy's image starts rolling across the

screen, until it disappears into a blur of static...

Maynard stares at the monitor.  The totally indecipherable

picture still rolls.  A glum pause.

Andy beams giddily.  Maynard gazes dully, struggling to

reason.

Beat.

Both men quickly extend their hands and shake.  Maynard nods

and leaves.

Beat.  Then, Andy pulls out a Handi-wipe and cleans his

palm.

A STUDIO PAGE walks over.  He has a huge MAIL BAG.

Andy looks up -- and his face lights up like Christmas.

INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Andy's crappy apartment, which looks like a dorm room: Cheap

furniture, stained carpet, and a framed photo of the

Maharishi.  Andy lies on his bed, which is covered with

THOUSANDS OF LETTERS.  He happily chats on the phone.

Andy holds a letter which has a GIRL'S SNAPSHOT stapled to

it.  He is very nervous.

Andy flips the letter over.  He glances at the return

address.

EXT. SAN BERNARDINO, DOWNTOWN - DUSK

The sun is setting.  In an ugly shopping district, Andy

walks along with sexy, wholesome MIMI.

A disinterested beat.

Another beat.

ANDY

Mimi is bewildered, and offended.

An awkward silence.  They continue walking.  She points up.

ANGLE - MIMI

Fear.  She shivers, then hoarsely speaks.

INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY

George screens Andy's TV Special for Maynard and his team.

The network execs look constipated.

ON THE TV - Andy speaks tenderly, lovingly to Howdy Doody.

Very gently, Andy touches Howdy's cheek and starts weeping.

THE EXECS -- are horrified.

Howdy, I've been

watching you ever

since I was a little

boy...

You're the first

friend from television

I ever had.  I always

wanted to meet you...

and now ...I finally

am.

At that moment, the picture turns to FUZZY SNOW.  Maynard

scowls.

Maynard angrily jumps and POUNDS on the TV.  BANG, BANG!

George winces -- then mutters awkwardly.

An awful beat.

Maynard is embarrassed.  Finally -- he explodes.

MAYNARD

INT. JERRY'S DELI - NIGHT

A delicatessen.  Andy wears an apron and angrily cleans

tables.  He stacks dirty dishes and wipes up the food.  Two

BLUE COLLAR GUYS gesture from a booth.

The guy nods.  Andy hurries over with the coffeepot and

starts pouring.

Andy hurries off.  The guy's buddy leans in, whispering.

NEAR THE KITCHEN

Andy dumps out wet coffee grounds.  He is sweating.  In the

b.g., George enters the restaurant.  He sees Andy, sits at a

table and YELLS OUT.

Andy turns.  They stare down each other.

Andy hurries off with a water pitcher.  George chases him.

A glum moment.

Andy fills water glasses.

EXT. TEXAS A&M COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

A marquee says "TEXAS A&M PRESENTS - ANDY KAUFMAN"

Inside, a ROAR of APPLAUSE surges.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - SAME TIME

Andy is walking onstage.  The excited CLAPPING swells.  He's

a gigantic presence to these people.

Andy smiles and bows.

Andy reacts, perturbed.  He struggles to stay composed.

Andy scowls.  Then -- he loses it.

Andy angrily hurries offstage.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM, BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Zmuda is with the congas and props.  Andy runs up.

Andy fiercely GRABS a small book from Zmuda.  Zmuda cringes.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Andy strides back out.  He gazes at the crowd.

BEAT.

Heh?  The crowd isn't quite clear if this is good or bad.  A

confused murmur.

There's a little NERVOUS LAUGHTER.  Is he really gonna read

this?

Suddenly, somebody from the audience screams:

The audience ROARS approvingly.  Andy stops reading and

looks at the student.  He smiles.

The audience APPLAUDS enthusiastically.  Andy waits until

the applause dies and goes back to the book.

People start BOOING.  Andy looks up.

The crowd is incredulous.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT NIGHT

The crowd is horribly bored.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM, BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

The clock says 11:30.  The PROMOTER glares at Zmuda.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT NIGHT

People are streaming out.  Maybe fifty are left.  Andy

realizes this -- but is committed.  He must continue.

A weak VOICE feebly shouts:

Andy looks up, shocked.  Insulted, he "blows his temper."

He slams the book shut.  People CHEER.  Andy starts to storm

off -- then turns.

The audience GROANS.

The audience ROARS for the record.  Andy smiles, puts the

needle on and to everyone's horror more "Gatsby" comes out.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT NIGHT

There are six people left in the audience.  Andy reads on.

Andy somberly shuts the book.

A moment of quiet personal euphoria.  Andy looks enraptured,

the man who has just climbed Everest.

A pause -- but no applause.  It's dead silence.  Andy looks

out... and realizes the few audience members are asleep.

Andy shrugs, then shuffles off-stage.

In the wings, Zmuda snores loudly in a folding chair.

EXT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - DAWN

Andy and Zmuda walk out, Zmuda squinting groggily.  They

drag the suitcase containing the props.  They walk slowly

towards their rental car, the campus totally deserted.

Andy nods uncomprehendingly.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

George is yelling at Andy and Zmuda.  They are seated on his

couch, heads bowed in shame.

Andy mumbles in a pipsqueak whimper.

George paces furiously.

Hmm.  Andy thinks.

ANGLE - ANDY

He doesn't know the answer.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST, BATHROOM - DAY

Andy is manically washing his hands.  Using liquid soap from

the dispenser, then rubbing his hands under the water.  Then

more liquid soap.  More rubbing.  Then more liquid soap...

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

George sighs at Zmuda.

Zmuda mulls this over.

EXT. MUSTANG RANCH, NEVADA - DAY

A tattered sign says "Welcome to the MUSTANG RANCH."  The

world-famous whorehouse sits behind a barb-wire fence.

Dusty connected trailers sit in the sand.

A CAR idles out front.  Zmuda and a scared Andy sit inside.

Andy nods.

INT. MUSTANG RANCH - DAY

The reception room -- wood paneling and black-lite posters.

Music is playing.  Twenty deadpan HOOKERS are lined up.

Andy, nervous as a high school kid, points at one... then

another... then the first...

Beat -- then Andy becomes GERMAN, with a monocle and stiff

walk.

The two chosen girls take Andy's hands and lead him off.  He

reaches the door -- then gives Zmuda a nervous look.  Zmuda

smiles reassuringly.  Andy gulps, and goes in...

Beat.  Zmuda turns to the older, jaded MADAM.

Zmuda's jaw drops, stupefied.

Disbelief -- then Zmuda LAUGHS sharply.  He's been conned.

INT. MUSTANG RANCH, BEDROOM - DAY

Andy and the two hookers are WRESTLING.  They grapple and

roll around, all three of them in their underwear.

Suddenly Andy flips the girls over and pins them with his

arms.

Breathing hard, he stares down.

Andy grins and leans down...

INT. TAXI SET, REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

The Taxi cast sits irritably around a big table, holding

scripts.  Ed Weinberger enters.

Suddenly -- the door SLAMS open.  Tony bounds in, filthy

drunk, clutching a bottle in a brown bag.

Little Wendy and the Hooker sashay in, dressed as tarts.

Tony feels them up, and they SQUEAL.  The cast stares in

horror.

Ed's expression goes ashen.

INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY

An attempted rehearsal.  Tony is tap-dancing on top of a car

hood.  He does a "fancy" move, and his booze bottle suddenly

flies away and CRASHES against the wall.

The cast watches, pissed and bored.

INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - DAY

Beleaguered Ed sits with George.

He points at Tony, swaggering around on the set.  George

shakes his head.

Ed glares.

Heh?  Ed raises his eyebrows.

INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - SECONDS LATER

George is on the phone.  Ed hovers.

Ed glances down at the stage... and suddenly Tony is no

longer there.  He's magically vanished.

Beat.

George turns on the SPEAKERPHONE, then CLICK!  Andy's happy

voice pops on the line.

Ed looks totally off-balance.  George winks at him.

INT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

Tony is on the phone.  Little Wendy is busily refilling his

whiskey bottle with canned ice tea.  He looks up, insulted.

INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - DAY

Andy thinks about this.

Andy hangs up.  A relieved Ed turns to George.

INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY

Tony SCREAMS insanely.

WIDE

Ed is stupefied.  The cast stands nervously behind him.

Ed is livid.  He gazes harshly at Tony -- Tony's burning

eyes piercing through the rubber features.

Suddenly -- FLASH!  Ed looks over.  A REPORTER has a camera.

UP IN THE BLEACHERS - George enters.  He looks down at the

growing debacle, and winces.  Uh-oh.

ONSTAGE - Enraged, Ed blows up.

ONSTAGE - Studio SECURITY GUARDS run over.  They GRAB Tony.

Tony scuffles.  The camera FLASHES.

IN THE BLEACHERS - George stares at this mess... and starts

giggling.

ONSTAGE - Two guards drag Tony to the door.

Tony SCREAMS and gets removed.  Dead silence.  Then --

The Guard reaches for the camera.  An uncertain moment...

until Zmuda authoritatively cuts in, from out of nowhere.

Zmuda takes the camera.  He casually starts to make his way

for the exit... when Ed suddenly HOLLERS.

Zmuda gasps.  Two guards go running for him.

Zmuda barrels away, trying to escape.  The guards chase.

Zmuda races by George, and suddenly palms off the camera

into George's arms.  The guards whip by, oblivious.

George grimaces, unclear about his loyalties.  He sweatily

peers at the timebomb in his hands.

And then -- George thrusts it under his jacket.  He bolts

for the door and feverishly scampers out.

EXT. PARAMOUNT LOT - DAY

George runs for his life.  He knocks aside a rack of

costumes and serpentines between people.

At the gate, Tony's being dragged, kicking and screaming.

The guards toss Tony out the gate.  He lands in a heap.

In the b.g., George crazily flies by.  He gets out the exit.

EXT. PARAMOUNT LOT, OUTSIDE THE GATES - DAY

George doubles over, trying to catch his breath.  He glances

down... and Tony is lying next to him.  Little Wendy and

Zmuda run up, out of breath.

They all look at each other.  There's a moment of

understanding.

George slowly smiles.

INT. TAXI OFFICES - SAME TIME

Ed storms in, insanely angry.

Ed is seething.  His SECRETARY timidly speaks.

Heh??!  Shaking with fury, Ed stares at the telephone...

then slowly picks it up.

A long pause... then Andy's voice calmly speaks.

A flabbergasted beat.

TIGHT - ED

He thinks intently about this.  And then... amazingly, a

magnificent smiles comes over his face.

Pause.

Andy hangs up.  Ed just sits there, astounded.

INT. LA HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Andy, Zmuda, George and Little Wendy are squeezed in a

booth, laughing and celebrating.  They eagerly read the LA

Times.

INSERT - The headline says "WHO IS TONY CLIFTON?"  Below is

a PHOTO of Tony being thrown off the Taxi set.

They all HOWL.

Zmuda reads one paragraph.

Hmm.  A few awkward glances.

Then -- Andy grins at his meal.

INT. BOOKER'S OFFICE - DAY

A slick BOOKER, sitting in a crowded office full of head

shots.  He's on the phone.  He's reading the LA Times story.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

George on the phone.

Disappointed beat.  The booker thinks.

George winces.

George rolls his eyes in annoyance.  Finally, he shrugs.

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY

George is driving in his convertible.  Suddenly, something

catches his eye -- and in shock he HITS the brakes.  Three

cars behind him SCREECH crazily, trying not to hit each

other.

George is oblivious.  He's staring up at a BILLBOARD.

The BILLBOARD: It says "HARRAH'S TAHOE PRESENTS, ANDY

KAUFMAN & TONY CLIFTON!  TOGETHER ON STAGE!  ONE NIGHT

ONLY!"

George is flabbergasted.

EXT. SUNSET BLVD, PHONEBOOTH - DAY

George is shouting into a payphone.

George is stupefied.  He looks at his watch.

EXT. LAKE TAHOE - DUSK

Magnificent HARRAH'S dominates the skyline.  The marquee

blares "TONY CLIFTON AND ANDY KAUFMAN!"  George screeches up

in a rental car.  He jumps out and runs inside.

INT. HARRAH'S SHOWROOM - NIGHT

The showroom is packed.  It hums with curiosity.  WAITERS

clean off the dinner tables.  George rushes in and is seated

in a far booth, with some STRANGERS.  He overhears a heated

conversation between a PUSHY MAN and his WIFE.

The onstage ORCHESTRA hits a fanfare.  LIGHTS DIM.  Sharp

SPOTLIGHTS meet at the foot of the stage.  Suddenly -- Tony

swaggers out, hands over his head in a gesture of triumph.

Thunderous APPLAUSE.  Tony beams.  The music stops.

George leans in, curious as to how Andy will wiggle out of

this.

Tony bows theatrically, turns back to face the orchestra,

and waits.  The NOISE LEVEL slowly drops -- but not

entirely.  Tony waits, and waits, and waits... until

suddenly he turns towards the audience and SCREAMS

FURIOUSLY.

Everybody looks up, alarmed.  The general murmur almost

dies.  Tony stands there, eyes flashing with anger at all

the unruly people.  As they quiet down... Tony turns back to

the orchestra and raises his arms.  The MUSICIANS lift their

instruments.  Silence is total -- except for the clank of

china.

Waiters are serving coffee.

Tony spins back around, livid.

People signal "shh"!  The waiters realize Tony's addressing

them, and they stare back in disbelief!  This is their job!

Tony's outburst is so commanding that they all freeze.  The

waiters stand there like statues, staring in terror.

Satisfied, Tony burns back to the orchestra and raises his

arms.  Again, the musicians lift their instruments.  In

anticipation of loud music, the waiters start moving about.

Audience members start whispering.  Tony hears this -- and

drops his arms and head in despair.

The musicians lower their instruments.  Tony waits for

absolute silence.  Only then does he signal the musicians to

get ready again.  They do.  And then at that precise moment

-- somebody DROPS a spoon.

Tony jolts, as if hit by a current.  He drops his hands

again, turns, and gives the perpetrator a murderous look.

Then he turns again, lowers his head, and waits.  And waits.

And waits.

The man at George's table WHISPERS to his wife.

George grins stupidly.  The silence is now deafening.

Slowly, very slowly, Tony raises his arms.  Slowly... the

musicians get their instruments ready.  Tony stands there,

and stands, and stands, waiting for something... anything...

to disturb the silence.  In vain.  Somebody COUGHS.  The

whole scene repeats itself.

Finally -- finally -- Tony is surrounded by total silence.

Then, (only a moment before the length of this scene would

become unbearable), he begins to move.  Tony pivots around,

looks at the audience...

And the entire room looks like Tussaud's Wax Museum.  Tony

starts LAUGHING hysterically.  The audience's reaction is

mixed:

Some people LAUGH.  Some BOO.  Some ask perplexed questions.

Some SCREAM OBSCENITIES.  Some even APPLAUD.

Tony is very happy.  He turns to the orchestra, raises his

baton -- and commences the downbeat!  The MUSIC BEGINS.

A SPOTLIGHT hits the wings... and then ANDY STRIDES OUT.

George's jaw drops.

The whole audience BURSTS INTO APPLAUSE.  Life is back to

normal.  Andy bows shyly and takes his place in front of a

prepared row of congas.  He starts to play.

Tony Clifton grabs the microphone.

He starts to BELT "I Gotta Be Me".

George squints his eyes, trying to figure out who this is.

Tony's singing is awful.  Andy happily accompanies on

congas.  The audience doesn't know what to think.

Tony's SINGING reaches the end... aggressive and off-key.

The BAND ends with a brassy punch.  The crowd responds with

LOUD BOOING.

INT. HARRAH'S, BACKSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

George wanders the corridor, looking for the dressing rooms.

He turns and finds a door marked "KAUFMAN".  Next to it is a

door marked "CLIFTON".

George stares.  He thinks, then opens the "KAUFMAN" door.

Andy is inside alone, gathering his things.  He's pleasantly

surprised to see George.

George doesn't enter.  He goes to the "CLIFTON" door.  Andy

follows.  George opens the mystery door...

INT. HARRAH'S, CLIFTON'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

and inside, taking off the rubber Tony makeup, is Zmuda.

George starts hyperventilating.  Shaking, he tries to sit

himself down.  Andy enters, beaming.  George is amazed.

Andy excitedly jumps up and down.

George is dazed.

Hmm.  Andy contemplates this.

A perplexed beat.

INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his glory days as a body-builder,

on the cover of a magazine.  Magazines are everywhere.  Body-

building.  Women's.  Wrestling.

ANDY is sifting through them.  Zmuda watches, worried.

Andy's face drops.  He realizes Zmuda's right.

Beat -- then Andy notices an issue of Sumo Magazine, with a

picture of a wrestler and his cute little fiance on the

cover.  He slowly lifts it up, intrigued.

INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - DAY

CLOSE UP on Andy and Merv Griffin.  Andy wears a goofy

wrestling outfit that resembles thermal underwear.  He is

shouting like a wrestler.

The audience MURMURS uncomfortably.  Andy laughs and

backpedals.

An appalled silence.

Merv winces.  Some people start BOOING.  We can tell Andy is

pleased.

Merv baitingly turns to the crowd.

WIDE

All the WOMEN'S hands angrily shoot up!

We move through the crowd, finally picking out... a feisty

woman, LYNNE.  She mutters, half hateful, half laughing --

INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - MINUTES LATER

Andy and Lynne stand in the ring.  She scornfully watches

him preen about.  Zmuda is in a referee's uniform.

Lynne extends her hand.  Andy fakes a shake -- then snidely

refuses and struts away.  The crowd HISSES.

DING!  It's the bell.  The match begins.  Lynne barrels at

him, craving a victory, but terribly unprepared for this

experience.  Andy immediately grabs her by the legs and

flips her over.

WHUMP!  She's down.  Andy has trained for this.

Zmuda gets on his knees, watching, trying to look official.

Lynne struggles and slithers away.

She grabs Andy's arm and forces him down.  People CHEER.

His torso hits the mat.  LOUDER CHEERS.  But suddenly he

rolls over and pulls her hair!  Her head snaps back.  The

crowd is INCENSED.  Zmuda hurries over and pantomimes a

stern warning.

Andy nods, and they separate.  They do a little dance around

the ring, Lynne looking for a hole.  Suddenly, Andy spins

her into a Half-Nelson.  Her arms are pinned.  They

struggle, then he throws her down on her stomach.  One!

Two!  Three!

And DING!  It's OVER.  Andy jumps up and sneers at the

crowd.

Lynne glares.

Out of the blue, and old RECORDING OF BOUNCY PIANO MUSIC

starts playing.  A chicken CLUCKS to the music, and Andy lip-

syncs along, doing an obnoxious cock o' the walk around the

ring.

INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW, BACKSTAGE - LATER THAT DAY

Lynne is escorted by a GUEST COORDINATOR.  Lynne is dazed.

The Coordinator hands her a bunch of crap.

Lynne takes her junk and hobbles off.  She passes Andy, who

sees her and grins.

Lynne coldly hurries away.  Andy chases after her.

Andy nods, pleased.

Lynne stares -- then begrudgingly cracks a smile.

INT. GOLD'S GYM - DAY

Jumbo-sized BEEFY MEN work out, sweating and groaning.  In a

corner, Andy lifts huge barbells.  George stares, pained.

MONTAGE OF WRESTLING MATCHES:

MATCH 1 - Andy throws a FAT WOMAN to the ground.

MATCH 2 - Andy squeezes a SMALL WOMAN in a headlock.

A charged moment.  Andy's eyes widen.  His speech gets

faster.

Beat.

Whoa.  Lynne stares into his eyes.

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, MEMPHIS - NIGHT

The arena is filled with furious BOOING SOUTHERN WRESTLING

FANS.  Ladies in hair nets.  Men clutching beer cans.  This

is a rougher crowd than we've seen before.

Andy stands in the ring, unshaven in a torn green robe.

He's screaming at them.

People BOOO louder and throw debris.  Andy is pleased.

Screeching JEERS and CATCALLS.  Down front... Lynne jumps

up.

The mob LAUGHS harshly.

The crowd APPLAUDS.  Lynne grins and starts to climb in the

ring.  Andy's eyes are ablaze.  But suddenly -- an oversized

Southern MAN jumps in and snatches the mike away.

Andy and Lynne are startled.

The crowd angrily starts to HISS.  Lynne whispers to Andy.

At that, a striking, muscular black woman stands -- FOXY.

The coliseum SCREAMS with excitement.  People POUND their

seats.  The roar is deafening.  Lawler gleams cockily.

Lynne looks worriedly at Andy -- he's concerned.

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - LATER THAT NIGHT

DING!  The bell rings.  Foxy comes out, ready to brawl.  But

Andy remains in his corner, running down the clock.  He

nonchalantly peels off his robe.  Foxy dances around

impatiently.  Andy casually removes a towel from his neck.

People BOO.  Still stalling, Andy then takes off his watch.

People SCREAM so furiously they're red-faced.  Andy is

tormenting them.  A TATTOOED GUY jumps up.

Andy sneers.  He cracks his knuckles, finally walks over...

and commences a WINDMILL.  Absurdly, he spins his arms

around and around, daring Foxy to get near him.

She rolls her eyes and waits.  The REF jumps out of the way.

A minute has counted down.  Finally, Andy stops -- and the

real wrestling begins.  Foxy lunges at him and immediately

goes for a choke-hold.  The crowd CHEERS, relieved.  Lawler

motions signals.  Foxy yanks -- but Andy jerks away.

Andy is intrigued.  She's coming to play!  Andy gestures to

the Ref and points UP.  The Ref looks away -- and Andy SLAPS

Foxy.

The crowd furiously JEERS.  The Ref spins around, and Andy

shrugs innocence.  He then runs at Foxy and theatrically

pushes her into the ropes.  She bounces off, stumbles back -

- and Andy drops to his knees.  She trips over him and hits

the mat.

Andy aggressively jumps onto Foxy's shoulders and pins her.

The Ref counts:  One!  Two!  Three!  DING!!

It's over.  But Andy stays on her, shaking his ass, leering

rudely.  Jerry Lawler yells from the corner.

Andy remains, flapping his arms like a chicken.

THE BOOING grows.  Louder.  More emotional.

Lawler hesitates -- then suddenly climbs in the ring and

lifts Andy off!  Lawler angrily PUSHES Andy down.

Andy is flabbergasted.

Lawler snickers and walks away.  Completely overreacting,

Andy grabs the mike.

Lawler snatches the mike and bellows.

Andy watches, fuming.  He is INFURIATED.

Andy grabs back the mike.  He sticks his face in shocked

Lawler's.

Andy bears his teeth.  Enraged, Lawler tries to take a swing

at him.  HANDLERS run in and separate the angry men.

EXT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, TUNNEL - LATER THAT NIGHT

We hear NOISE from the main event above.  Andy and Lynne

hurry along.  She is disgruntled.  He swaggers arrogantly,

still in his fighting outfit.

She's unamused.

She shoots him a stern look.

Andy laughs.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

George stares glumly at Andy.  Andy is quite cheerful --

eating a big piece of chocolate cake.

Andy shrugs, lacking a response.  He eats more cake.

Andy gets a strange gleam.  He only heard one thing.

INT. FRIDAYS SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY

The FRIDAYS CAST prepares.  In a corner, ANDY is arguing

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME

INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT

In the front row, Michael sits with a girl.  He whispers.

The girl smiles excitedly.

The SKETCH is on a French restaurant set.  ANDY sits at a

table with actor RICHARDS and actress MELANIE.  Another

stoned.

She GIGGLES more.  The other three play baffled.

Andy stands and walks out.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME

INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT

Actors read the menus.  Suddenly Andy returns, a strange

grin on his face.  He's swaying on his feet.

The audience WHOOPS:  "Yeah!  All right!"

Andy awkwardly sits.  He has a strange hesitancy.

Suddenly he STOPS.  The actors glance up.

Andy purses his lips, fretting.  An endless pause.

Uh-oh.  Andy won't finish the line.  The cast looks around

worriedly.  Live TV is beaming out... Finally, Melanie

covers.

Andy shakes his head.

The crowd laughs nervously.

INT. FRIDAYS SET, CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT

The TECH DIRECTOR and his crew are bewildered.  They flip

through script pages.

But Maynard raises a calm hand.

INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT

Silence.  Andy is torn up inside.

More silence.  The actors are trapped and upset.

The tension is awful.

Unsure beat -- then fed-up Richards jumps up and storms off

the set.  A CAMERAMAN hesitantly pans, confused what to do.

Mary is lost.  She continues giggling, "stoned."

Richards returns... with the CUE CARDS.  Irked, he dumps

them over Andy's head.

The crowd CHEERS stupidly.

Andy gets enraged, grabs his prop water glass and THROWS it

in Richard's face.

Melanie slaps her prop butter in Andy's hair.

WIDE - Jack runs up from the floor.  He gestures at the

booth.

Andy HITS Jack.  Jack recoils and SLUGS him.  They start

FIGHTING.

BURLY CREWMEN run in.  The crowd WHOOOOOS.

The tech crew is freaking out.  Maynard is oddly calm.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME

Stanley and Janice are flabbergasted.  Jaws wide.

On their TV - fists are flying.  Suddenly, the BAND kicks in

and the show abruptly cuts to COMMERCIAL.

They stare at the TV.  Until --

INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT

Andy and Jack are socking each other.  A FLOOR DIRECTOR

screams at the top of his lungs.

Andy turns.  He notices the red lights are off -- and...

instantly stops fighting.  Just like that.  Jack instantly

stops too.  They glance at each other -- hold a beat -- then

break into GUFFAWS.  They laugh and joyously kid each other.

In the audience, Michael is STUNNED.

All the commotion stops.  The audience doesn't know whether

to laugh or boo.  The actors are flabbergasted -- then

furious.

Suddenly Maynard runs out of the booth, beaming.  People

watch curiously.

Andy seems discombobulated.  Maynard shouts out to EVERYBODY

assembled.

The audience LAUGHS and APPLAUDS wildly.  The actors stare

in disbelief.  One laughs hysterically.  Most are pissed.

Crew members start moving things around.

In the audience, Michael locks eyes with Andy.  An odd,

knowing moment between the brothers.  Michael whispers,

getting worried.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME

Stanley and Janice feel as if the commercials are lasting

forever.

The Fridays JINGLE starts, and Andy's face fades in on the

TV.  He looks directly into the camera, nervous, stiff and

serious.

INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT

The sign above blinks "APPLAUSE".  The audience obediently

APPLAUDS.  In the booth, Maynard grins.

Maynard is suddenly very confused.  The crowd laughs

nervously.

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - NIGHT

The THEME FROM "MIGHTY MOUSE" begins playing.  Then, ANDY

strides in, a sneer on his grungy face.  The crowd SCREAMS

and BOOS pure pile.  Andy is euphoric, loving the hatred.

Down in the front row sit Stanley, Janice, Zmuda, and Lynne.

Several PHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures of the parents.  They

squint, unused to all this.

Andy prances into the ring.  He takes the mike.

Holy cow.  The crowd is flabbergasted.  Women in K-mart

dresses gape.  Ruddy men in trucker caps glare.

Lynne snickers.  But Stanley and Janice are ashen-faced.

Andy reaches in his pocket and removes... a bar of SOAP.

Stanley's eyes bulge.

The crowd is enraged -- rumblings of imminent violence.

Andy smiles helpfully.

Andy holds up a ROLL OF TISSUE.

That's it.  The crowd goes NUTS.  Jerry Lawler races over

and snatches the mike, trying to maintain his dignity.

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - SECONDS LATER

And DING!  That's the bell!  Andy strikes a threatening

pose.  Lawler takes a step forward -- and Andy instantly,

cowardly, runs for the ropes and jumps out of the ring.

BOOOOO!!!  Andy grins at the crowd and points at his brain:

I'm smarter.

Lawler disparagingly frowns.  The REF checks his watch.

Andy crosses to the opposite end of the ring, gauging his

rival... then slowly climbs in --

Until the second Lawler moves.  Then Andy leaps back out!

Andy struts around the floor, pointing to his brain.  He

smirks at various spectators... until he finds himself face-

to-face with -- his parents.

An unexpected moment.  Andy's finger frozen on his brain.

Janice shakes her head despairingly.

Cameras FLASH.  The paparazzi love these moments.

Beat -- then Andy gets HIT in the head with a cup.

People HOOT.  Disoriented, Andy returns to the ringside.

Lawler is losing his patience.

Andy paces around, unsure of his next move.

Lawler leans down and offers his neck.

Andy peers skeptically.  People JEER.  Andy looks at waiting

Lawler... then tentatively climbs in.

As promised, Lawler doesn't move.  So Andy crosses over and

grabs Lawler's head!  Andy grins triumphantly.  He squeezes

his arms tight, muscles flexing, riding high on this moment.

Until -- Lawler stands and flips him over.  Andy SLAMS DOWN

on his back.  CRUNCH!

Andy lies on the mat, unmoving.  Lawler doesn't care.  He

picks up Andy's prone body and grips it upside-down.  Janice

covers her eyes.  Stanley is worried.

Lawler disregards the Ref and slams Andy's head in a pile-

driver!!

A horrible THUD.

DING!  The BELL immediately RINGS.

JANICE opens her eyes and SCREAMS.

Andy's parents' reaction is a fiesta for photographers.

Andy is splayed unconscious.

Raging Lawler promenades around the ring, arms over his

head.  The crowd SHOUTS CRAZILY, rooting him on.

Lynne runs to the ropes, SCREAMING for help.

Stanley, totally numbed, holds Janice.  They're on the verge

Andy chuckles.

Suddenly, Andy grabs the coffee and DUMPS it on Lawler!

Lawler jumps, burned.  A SECURITY GUARD runs in.

Andy screams and hurtles away.  He slams open the stage door

and barrels out of sight.

INT. LORNE MICHAELS' HOUSE - SAME TIME

Lorne Michaels is watching this at home.  He gapes in

disbelief.

INT. SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE - ONE WEEK LATER

A SMUG COMIC stands on stage, speaking into camera.  The

show's going out live.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

Tight on Andy, staring at the LA Times.  A small headline

says "JOKESTER ANDY KAUFMAN VOTED OFF 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE'"

He is bothered.

George sighs.

At that... we reveal that SOMEONE ELSE is sitting next to

Andy.  But only the back of his head is visible.

We WIDEN...

And the other person is JERRY LAWLER.  He feels bad.

Andy gulps emotionally.

Andy and Jerry hug.

A touching beat... until Andy gets a Quixotic gleam.

Andy's face drops.

INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CORRIDOR - DAY

The Yogi slowly walks down the corridor, deep in thought.  A

few DISCIPLES IN TURBANS mill around.

INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CLASSROOM - DAY

NINE STUDENTS, sitting in the Lotus position, are listening

to a teacher.  The teacher is Andy.

Andy is repeating this faster and faster; the students are

blinking their eyes faster and faster.

The door opens.  The Yogi sticks his head in.

The Yogi signals Andy to step out of the room.

INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CORRIDOR - DAY

Andy steps out.

Andy is stunned.

Andy is stupefied.  He doesn't know how to respond.

The Yogi shakes his head.  Andy can't believe it.  He looks

around -- men in turbans staring at him.

Andy cracks.

Andy is broken.

He fights to bottle his rage -- then notices Little Wendy

down the corridor, peering helplessly.  Beaten, Andy waves

goodbye to her.

Little Wendy gulps, then waves goodbye too.

INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Middle of the afternoon, Andy lies in bed.  Covers pulled up

to his face, expression glum, he's like a tragic still-life.

Suddenly DING-DONG!  It's the doorbell.

Andy ignores this.  Beat.  Another DING-DONG!  Then

KNOCKING.

The door opens.  Lynne enters, holding a carton of ice

cream.

TIGHT - ANDY

An astonished silence.

And then... he slowly smiles.

They both giggle.

Andy studies her... looking at Lynne's face, body, eyes.

Pause.

Lynne smiles slyly.  She leans down and kisses him.

EXT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DAY

A moving van outside a funky 60's house.  MOVERS carry boxes

in.

INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

Andy sits disoriented in the living room.  Movers bustle

around him.  Mirrors get leaned against opposing walls --

and he finds himself looking into multiple reflections of

himself.

In the b.g., Lynne arranges some vases, then hurries out.

Andy opens a box and pulls out his old Howdy Doody doll.  He

smiles, then places Howdy on the shelf next to the vases.

Suddenly a phone on the floor RINGS.  He grins.

Silence.

Andy has no response.

Andy hangs up.  He just sits there... confused... unsure how

to react.

Andy scratches his head -- then feels something odd.  He

goes over to the mirror.  On the back of his neck... is an

inflamed red pimple.  Andy grimaces.

INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - LATE NIGHT

Very late -- a clock says 1:15.  A YOUNG COMIC is onstage,

performing to the DOZEN audience members left.

In back walks... Andy.  Unshaven, morose, he quietly

approaches paternal owner BUDD FRIEDMAN.  Budd sees him,

grins, and gives him a hearty hug.  Andy points at the stage

and asks for something -- Budd eagerly nods.

INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Budd is onstage.

The sparse crowd APPLAUDS.  Budd leaves, and Andy shuffles

up.

The crowd AWWWWS sadly.  Andy blinks.

One guy LAUGHS sharply.

Andy gives him a look -- thinks -- then continues.

Andy turns.  The red lump is bigger, grosser.  The crowd

GROANS, revolted.

A couple stoners GIGGLE and CLAP.  Andy COUGHS, then frowns.

A pause... then a few curious people walk up to the stage.

The first taker is a GOOFY BLONDE WOMAN.  She starts to

reach for the cyst -- when Andy stops her.

She nods, discomforted, and reaches for her purse...

INT. LA IMPROV, BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

A BUSBOY sweeps up.  Budd counts money in the cash register.

Andy shuffles out of the showroom.  He waves some bills.

Budd stares sadly.

Andy thinks.  The wheels are spinning.

EXT. MELROSE - DAY

George is driving down Melrose, listening to the radio.  He

glances at the passing marquee -- then does a doubletake.

It says "ANDY KAUFMAN - 9 P.M."

INT. LA IMPROV, LOBBY - THAT NIGHT

Puzzled George hurries inside.  COMICS greet him: "Hey

George!"  "George, you got a second?!"  George distractedly

waves and moves through.  At the showroom door, he finds

Budd.

Inside, there's HUGE LAUGHTER.  George's eyes widen.

Piqued, he goes in...

INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - NIGHT

And it's packed!  Andy is onstage, playing struggling,

lovable Foreign Man.

Foreign Man chuckles pathetically.

The crowd HOWLS.  Andy's rockin'.

The rhythm is thrown.  A couple laughs.

A flustered pause.  Andy glances down, then continues.

The laughs are weaker.  The act is getting wrecked.

IN BACK - George grimaces.  Who the hell's doing this??

Angry, George hurries down front, looking for the loud jerk.

He scans the tables... and it's Zmuda.

Andy freezes up.

The audience is embarrassed.

A frazzled confusion, then Andy drops the accent.  He glares

at Zmuda.

Andy winces.

GEORGE - is dumbfounded.

ON ANDY AND ZMUDA

Andy shudders.

The audience averts their eyes.

A painful silence.

"Andy Kaufman" has been destroyed.

EXT. LA IMPROV - LATER THAT NIGHT

Andy and George walk sadly down the street.  There is a

horrible gloom over them.

The guys stop walking.  George gently speaks.

ON ANDY

He nods.

INT. LAUREL CANYON, BEDROOM - NIGHT

The telephone wakes up Lynne in the new bedroom.  She looks

over -- Andy's not there.  She looks at the clock and it's

4:30 am.  She picks up the phone.

Lynne's baffled.

INT. DENNY'S - DAWN

Late-night Hollywood weirdos mill about.  Andy sits with

bleary Lynne, Zmuda, and George.  Zmuda admires the menu.

All heads turn.  A long pause.

Then -- Andy stiffly speaks.

Beat.  Zmuda nods.

Pause.  Lynne is puzzled.

Andy softly shakes his head.

Lynne's eyes tear up.  She hugs onto Andy.

George and Zmuda glance skeptically at each other.  Hmm...

Confused, George leans in to Andy.

Andy gulps.

INT. DENNY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

George confronts Zmuda.

INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DAY

Andy is doing laundry.  He empties the clean clothes, puts

them in a basket, and carries them to the rug.  Then he sits

down and starts laying out pairs of socks in highly

symmetrical patterns.  Focused, impassive, Andy pointlessly

orders the socks like the world depended on it.

Lynne enters, emotionally wrecked.  She stares in

frustration at Andy's behavior.

He keeps working.  Lynne loses it.

Lynne storms out.

Andy finishes his socks.  Satisfied... he turns on the TV.

ON THE TV: It's "Lassie."  Little TIMMY is laid-up in bed,

with a broken leg.  Suddenly LASSIE runs in, holding a book.

Lassie places the book on his lap.  The boy smiles

gratefully.

Timmy warmly embraces the dog.

ANDY - is terribly touched.  Tears start rolling down his

face.

Genuine sobbing.  Terrible grief, until he wipes his cheeks.

Andy collects himself, then reaches for a phone.  He dials a

long number.

INT. CEDARS SINAI, RADIATION ROOM - DAY

ANDY lies under the machine.  It bombards his body with

powerful radiation.

INT. CEDARS SINAI, DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

The whole Kaufman family is gathered.  Stanley, Janice,

Michael and Carol listen to a BLAND DOCTOR in a white coat.

The doctor leaves.  A somber silence -- and then Janice

bursts into tears.  Stanley hugs her tightly.

Carol watches the doctor with great hostility.  His old

tennis shoes are grabbing her attention.  He leaves, and she

frowns.

A standoff moment.  Carol loses it.

A moment of total silence.  All four of them look at each

other.  Is there... a glimmer of hope?

EXT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DAY

George pulls up in his convertible.  He jumps out.

He walks to the door and starts to knock -- when suddenly it

creeps open.  It's Lynne, putting her finger to her lips:

Shh!

INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

The house is dark.  Lynne leads George into the shrouded

living room... and Andy is sitting in a Lotus position,

concentrating.  In front is a WILD-HAIRED MAN in a purple

robe.

In the corner -- George stares.  He's fighting his

skepticism.

INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

The drapes are open.  Sunlight streams in.  Andy hugs the

teacher goodbye, and the man leaves.

George has been waiting in back.

Long beat.

Ah.  Andy's eyes widen.  His wheels are spinning fast.

ON GEORGE - He glares, stewing.  George is fed up.

ON ANDY - An unspoken tension.  Then suddenly, he breaks

down.

George shakes his head.

Andy struggles to remain composed.  George sighs.

George gently smiles.

INT. NATIONAL ENQUIRER OFFICES - DAY

A STAFF meeting at the National Enquirer.

Beat.  The room GROANS.

The Reporter frowns.

INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - NIGHT

A 16mm PROJECTOR runs a scratchy 1930's movie short on the

wall.  Smiling fake COWBOYS and COWGIRLS dance, the cowgirls

straddling hobby horses.  They all SING.

WE WIDEN

Andy, George and Zmuda watch.  Andy's face is enthralled

like a kid.

Andy smiles.

Pause.  George considers this -- then slowly nods.

INT. CEDARS SINAI - DAY

Andy silently sits.  The doctor and two NURSES administer a

chemo drip into Andy's body.

He stares at the needle in his arm.

The chemo begins.

EXT. CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT

A dressy NEW YORK CROWD pushes into Carnegie Hall.  The

marquee says "ANDY KAUFMAN."

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT

The show is on.  Andy effusively PLAYS his conga drum and

SINGS nonsense words to "Allouette, Gentille Alloutte."

Everyone repeats.  In the audience, George sings along too.

The crowd hopelessly breaks out LAUGHING.

ANDY laughs along.  They're all having a good time.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT

The corny "Jingle Jangle Cowboy" MOVIE is playing on a big

screen.  It finishes.  Beaming Andy grabs the mike.

Crazed APPLAUSE.  Frail ELEANOR GOULD, 75, comes onstage.

Eleanor starts to protest -- but Andy hands her the HOBBY

HORSE.  She blushes.  Andy turns away, goes to the band, and

starts conducting.  They begin to PLAY "JINGLE JANGLE

JINGLE."  Eleanor awkwardly starts dancing in circles.

Andy gets excited and conducts FASTER.  Eleanor is sweating.

She dances faster.

Andy impatiently SPEEDS UP the MUSIC MORE.  Eleanor

desperately skips in circles, trying to keep up... when

suddenly she grabs her heart.

Eleanor stops -- and collapses.  She's down.

A horrified GASP from the crowd.  The band stops playing.

CREW MEMBERS run on from backstage.  One checks her heart.

She's not moving.  Zmuda runs out, horrified.

The crowd is stunned silent.  Pause -- then one man stands.

It's Michael.

Straight-faced, he hurries out of his seat, sprints down the

aisle, and goes on stage.  Michael checks her pulse and

loosens her blouse.  He presses Eleanor's chest, trying to

restart her heart.  But then -- he shakes his head sadly.

She's dead.

The crowd MOANS sadly.  Michael covers Eleanor with a

jacket.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL, BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Andy watches, pleased.  Suddenly, he COUGHS harshly.  Andy

drinks some water.  Pause... then he puts on a goofy Indian

headdress and runs back out.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT

Eleanor lies dead.  Andy skips over and starts doing an

Indian war dance around her body.  The crowd is baffled.

Andy WHOOPS, he CHANTS... and then Eleanor starts to rise!

He WHOOPS triumphantly.  She lives, like Frankenstein

reborn!  The crowd CHEERS, surprised and giggling.

Huge APPLAUSE.

Rear curtains part, and the MORMON TABERNACLE CHOIR belts

out the "Hallelujah Chorus"!

It's spectacular.  The crowd goes nuts.

Yes indeed, TWO DOZEN ROCKETTES rush in from the sides, legs

kicking high.

The crowd WHOOS.

Snow start falling, and SANTA ON HIS SLEIGH drops from

above.

The crowd screams with excitement.  It's unbelievable.  They

leap to a standing ovation.

In front are Stanley and Janice.  They start crying.

Beaming Andy embraces Eleanor.  Then he takes the mike.

The crowd laughs.

EXT. CARNEGIE HALL - MINUTES LATER

A thousand people file out -- and THIRTY-FIVE SCHOOLBUSES

are parked up and down Fifth Avenue!!!  The crowd is AWED.

Andy euphorically marches out, pushing his endurance.  He's

the Pied Piper.

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER THAT NIGHT

The schoolbuses pull up to a school.  The disoriented

passengers step out, not sure what to expect...

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CAFETERIA - NIGHT

The audience crowds inside... and LADY CAFETERIA WORKERS in

hairnets are dispensing milk and cookies.  It's remarkable.

At a little kids table sit Andy and Lynne.  Andy's face is

pure joy.  He watches all the adults munching on their

cookies, everyone giddy at the silliness of it all.

Andy smiles beautifully.  He squeezes Lynne's hand, then

whispers.

EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAY

A stucco SPA RESORT sits in the middle of the rocky desert.

INT. SPA - SAME TIME

A room with soft lighting and billowing curtains.  A New Age

HEALER is laying crystals upon Andy's body.

Andy COUGHS.  His hat is off, revealing he's bald.

EXT. SPA - DAY

Zmuda stands with a swarmy ADMINISTRATOR.

The man purses his lips.

Zmuda is speechless.

INT. SPA, ANDY'S ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Zmuda angrily packs Andy's bags.  Zmuda is seething.

But Andy is strangely calm and unaffected.

INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

Lynne and Little Wendy are cooking Andy lunch.  Lynne mashes

up strange unidentifiable plant products.

Suddenly -- a SHARP VOICE.

The women turn.  It's Andy -- dressed as Tony Clifton.

A spooked moment.

Tony's wig, peach tux, and sunglasses are there... but Andy

is barely strong enough to bark out the attitude.

Little Wendy's eyes pop:  Oh no she broke the rule!  Tony

gets very indignant.

Tony picks up a CHAIR and starts lifting it:  Up, down, up,

down.  Worried, the women rush to stop him.  They take the

chair.

Tony jauntily turns to exit.  He gestures to the ladies.

Tony reaches the doorway -- and collapses.

He clutches himself in pain.

Shocked, they run over.

Tony lies huddled on the ground.  He mutters sadly,

defeatedly.

EXT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DUSK

The sun is setting, purple and orange over the hills.  Andy

and George lie on chaise lounges, serenely staring out.

Andy has a blank look on his face, and has lost more weight.

He is a shadow of himself.

Andy softly sighs.

George silently pats Andy.  Andy's energy is sapped, but he

forces himself to be upbeat.

George is choked up.  He goes along with it.

Silence.

George struggles not to shatter Andy's enthusiasm.

Andy smiles gratefully.

George clenches Andy's hand.

Andy beams.  George stares sadly.

TIGHT - ANDY

His voice gets hushed.

George doesn't know how to respond.

Andy looks up pleadingly.

EXT. BAGUIO CITY, PHILIPPINES - DAY

Baguio, a tiny scratched-in-the-dirt Philippine city.

Suddenly, a rattletrap COMMUTER PLANE lurches out of the

sky.  It hits a dirt runway.  Dust flies.  Chickens squawk

and run.

INT. BEAT UP TAXI, PHILIPPINES - DAY

Andy, Lynne, and Zmuda ride through the impoverished city.

Andy stares in amazement.

EXT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY

They reach a brick building.  A sign says "CLINIC," with an

eye over a triangle.

INT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY

A NURSE hurriedly helps weakened Andy sign a bunch of forms.

Money is handed over.

Andy's clothes are stripped off.  They're thrown in a

locker.

INT. CLINIC OPERATION ROOM, PHILIPPINES - DAY

A large white tiled room.  Lynne and Zmuda roll in pallid

Andy, his limp body unmoving.

Andy looks up... and there's a LONG LINE OF SICKLY PEOPLE.

Primarily Japanese, emaciated, all stripped to their

underwear and barely able to stand.

They have a look of desperation and reverence.

At the head of the line is JUN ROXAS at his work station: A

bench, a sink, and ATTENDANTS with clean towels.

A SICKLY WOMAN crawls onto the bench.  Jun impassively

presses his hand into the fatty flesh of her stomach,

kneading, searching.  Pause, then he removes some BLOODY

GUTS.

He flings them into a bucket.

The woman cries out.

Andy gasps.

The woman is helped away.

Jun turns to wash his hands.  An attendant gives him a towel

to dry with.  Then a SICKLY MAN crawls up...

Andy rolls closer.  He stares at all this with fear.

Nervousness.  Hope.

Jun impassively presses his hand against the man's head.  He

concentrates, searching... then pulls out some BLOODY GUTS.

He flings them into a bucket.

The man shakes.  He is helped away.

Andy is wide-eyed.  He gets closer... closer...

More patients.  More bloody guts.  More sobbing.

Andy's excitement builds.

Then -- he reaches the front.

A moment.

Lynne and Zmuda stare into Andy's eyes, drawn in by his

total belief.  They are overcome.  It feels like they're

saying goodbye.  Lynne gives Andy a tender kiss.  Zmuda

starts to shake his hand -- and instead hugs him tightly.

Andy smiles, then the attendants lift him from the

wheelchair.  They help him up to the bench.

Andy lies down.  Fluorescent lights buzz overhead.

He looks over, and Jun Roxas is washing his hands from the

previous patient.

Andy shivers, anticipating the miracle.

Jun turns.  An attendant gives him a towel to dry off.

Andy relaxes, readying for it all...

He glances at Jun's hands.  Jun hands back the towel -- and

under it the attendant quickly slips Jun a sack of animal

intestines.

Jun discreetly palms it.  He's a fake.

CLOSEUP - ANDY

A moment of stunned disbelief.

He is shocked.  Outraged.  Disappointed.  Flabbergasted.

The faith is meaningless.  The joke is cosmic.  The con man

has been conned.

Andy's overpowering emotions coalesce... and he starts to

LAUGH.

It's sidesplittingly funny.  Andy LAUGHS, and LAUGHS, and

LAUGHS, like a crazy man with no salvation, the joy

releasing him, the tears rolling down his cheeks.

His face flushes with color.  Life sparkles in his eyes.

Andy laughs and guffaws until he's hoarse.  This is the best

gag of them all.

INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

Andy lies in peace in a casket.  He has died.

His expression is pleasantly bland.  Almost Latka-like.  But

his face is caked with so much funeral-home makeup, it

almost looks like a mask.

We slowly widen.  The casket is surrounded by beautiful

flowers.  We TILT UP... and high above... is a MOVIE SCREEN.

On the SCREEN is a projection of Andy, silently staring at

us.  There's a gentle smile on his face.  It's the image

from the opening of this film.

ANDY'S POV: The chapel is filled with GRIEVING MOURNERS.

All are in black.  Everyone's quiet, in a state of shock.

Andy's family is huddled.

Lynne sits alone in a pew, crying.

George gives Zmuda a hug.  Little Wendy comes over... and

they comfort each other.

Everyone who ever knew Andy is there: Taxi cast, Fridays

cast, TM followers, hookers, Jerry Lawler, Ed Weinberger,

Maynard Smith, Budd Friedman, it goes on and on...

And -- they all have odd discombobulated expressions.  They

stare up at the PROJECTED ANDY.

Some gathered people tentatively join in the SINGING.

The curtain behind the coffin OPENS and the casket with

Andy's body slowly slides into the DARKNESS.

The curtain closes.  The FILM ENDS.

And all goes silent.

Some people cry.  Some begin to leave.  Most of them are

just staying, numbed.

George and Zmuda whisper.

The Taxi cast are flustered.

Silence.  They look to the front.

The closed curtain wafts... then settles motionless.

FADE IN:

EXT. SUNSET BLVD./COMEDY STORE - NIGHT

A SUPER slowly appears:  "EXACTLY ONE YEAR LATER"

On Sunset, TWO DUDES come riding along on skateboards.

Suddenly they reach -- INSANITY.  Traffic on Sunset is

jammed.  HONKING limousines jockey to squeeze by.

Confused, one Dude squints into the distance -- and his eyes

pop.

He points.  His friend turns -- and gasps.

AT THE COMEDY STORE - The marquee says "TONY CLIFTON: LIVE!"

Hysterical, the guys race up to the club.  But outside,

there's a CRAZED, PULSING MOB.  People are screaming.

Police have barricades.  Everybody cries to get in.

INT. COMEDY STORE - SAME TIME

It's packed.  Every square inch is filled with glittery

Hollywood VIPs.  People make chit-chat... but there is a

squeamish excitement in the air.  A brooding unease.  Nobody

knows what to expect.

Suddenly -- the lights go black.  A BOOMING ANNOUNCER.

The THEME FROM 2001 starts playing.  "DAAAAA, DAAAAA,

DAAAAA!  DA-DAAAAA"!

A small SPOT appears -- on a peach tuxedo.  The light grows

bigger, bigger... the tension magnifying... people

gasping... our view widening... until Tony Clifton is

revealed onstage!

It's an extraordinary theatrical moment -- without response.

The crowd has no idea what to do.

Tony smirks.

Dead silence.

Tony struts downstage.  He waves to the crowd.

Still no response.  Until -- a lone reckless VOICE.

Whoa.  The crowd rustles nervously.

Tony grimaces.

The BAND kicks in with disco anthem "I WILL SURVIVE."  Tony

starts SINGING the schmaltzy opening:

We PAN the room full of enthralled spectators.  At a front

table are George and Lynne.

Tony attacks the chorus.

In the crowd, we pass face after face -- smiling...

frowning... intrigued... confused... until we settle on a

man in the very last row.

Bob Zmuda.

Enjoying the show more than anyone.

The music CRESCENDOS, and the song ENDS.

Zmuda grins and APPLAUDS proudly.

THE END
