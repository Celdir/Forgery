PRESENTATION CREDITS appear... then FADE...

Out of BLACK... SHOCK CUT TO:

INT   LAB   "A" LEVEL   TIMELESS

A MAN'S FACE, filling the screen.

We're watching A VIDEO MONITOR. A pre-recorded tape shows

a view of what is obviously a pristine-RESEARCH LABORATORY.

DR. JOHN MARCUS, in a lab coat, faces THE CAMERA, disheveled

and looking like a madman.

INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS

Overhead lamps cast pools of LIGHT down onto A CONFERENCE

TABLE, onto THE HANDS of PEOPLE assembled to observe the

video. We see NO FACES. But expensive WATCHES, sleeves

with high-ranking STRIPES, indicate wealth, power, and a

military presence.

THE VIDEO: On the wall behind MARCUS, we see SHADOWS darting

frantically. We hear VOICES rising in panic.

The CAMERA is SWATTED by A HAND that lurches suddenly into

the foreground. We only see it for a few video frames, but

we might subliminally notice LESIONS on the flesh. The IMAGE

SWIRLS wildly. The next clear picture we see... is of the

same laboratory...topsy-turvy. THE CAMERA is lying on its

side on the floor.

A LASER POINTER casts a RED DOT on a corner of the video

screen, indicating A HUNCHED FIGURE, leaning over A HUMAN

BODY, apparently ...feeding! With a GRUNT, the figure turns.

and LUNGES, it's face covered with BLOOD, at the CAMERA. The

image SWIRLS again, and the SCREEN GOES BLACK. With a MUSIC

STING, a single TITLE appears, full across the blackness...

Pg-2

EXT  FOREST LAND   PRE-DAWN

A DARK SKY ...and in the foreground, profiled against a FULL

MOON, A DARK FACE ...watching the heavens with piercing black

eyes, alert, though not predatory. This is CHRIS REDFIELD,

young, handsome. More than simply an outdoor type, he seems

perfectly in place, almost part of the environment.

A band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of

magnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles. Sitting

on a ridge, squinting into that band of light, Chris sees ...

...AN EAGLE coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through

the hilltops. As the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes

recognizable. Chris smiles and jots a note on a pad.

The regal bird lands on a high rock where ...unexpectedly...

a freshwater trout lies flapping, three-thousand feet above

the highest water.

"Goliath" snaps up the fish and flies away with it.

Chris reaches into a water-filled bucket, pulls out another

trout, climbs efficiently, unerringly, across a precarious

Cliffside, and deposits the fresh fish on the-same high rock.

ANOTHER EAGLE, smaller, a female, appears in the sky.

Chris scrambles back to his place and jots another note.

"Cleopatra" spots the fish, pumps her wings, and swoops down.

She's about to snap up the prize, but at the last minute, she

recoils and climbs again, hovering.

The eagle circles, its sharp eyes scanning. It makes another

dive, but stops short again.

The bird seems frightened.  Of what? It makes one more dive.

Gets very close to the fish... but suddenly SHRIEKS and peels,

away from the rock. Chris sees its eyes, looking crazed, as

it soars right past him, its wings brushing his hair.

Pg-3

CLOSE ON: CHRIS, concerned, as he watches the eagle disappear

over the hills.

Over his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the

fish. It's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight

catches SOMETHING MOVING there. Something that lets out a

sharp INHUMAN SOUND.

Chris whirls around. There's nothing on the rock. Nothing

at all. The fish has been taken.

INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   DAWN

CHRIS walks into a characterless apartment. He quietly

sheds his clothes. Even in silhouette, we can see that his

body is in perfect shape, not pumped, but lean and tight.

Moving lithely, with the natural grace of a cat, he eases

himself into a bed where...

...a beautiful young girl, JILL VALENTINE, seems to be fast

asleep. As Chris nestles in beside her, we see that her

eyes, facing away, are open. Chris gently drapes an arm

around her and lets his body relax.

His apology goes no further. He's still troubled by what

happened in the hills.

Chris smiles politely. He offers...

Pg-4

...but he can't switch focus.

Chris apologizes again, this time more sincerely.

Jill rolls over and faces him.

Pg-5

Jill is being playful. Chris, taking her question to heart,

becomes introspective.

Now Jill becomes introspective.

Chris looks into her eyes. She kisses him gently.

They kiss again, this time more passionately. Rolling over,

they begin to make love.

EXT   FARM   DAWN

The purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite

dark when a crusty old farm-hand, RAKE, opens the creaking

door of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads THREE HORSES

out into the morning breeze.

Two dogs, A LAB and A SPANIEL, romp at his heels as Rake

opens a log gate.

Pg-6

-

Two of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large

corral. The third, a beautiful stallion, resists, snorting,

tossing its head in high spirit.

"LUCKY" moves into the corral, strutting proudly.

Rake waves his flashlight, not meanly, there is clearly a

great deal of affection here. Rake shuts the gate behind

the stallion, who begins to gallop around happily inside

the fence. All seems lovely, until...

...the dogs suddenly go on point. Their ears perk. They

sniff the air...and begin to WHINE.

KER-RAAKK! A startling SOUND. Rake turns to find Lucky and

the other horses, their eyes flaring, trying to KICK their

way out of the fencing. They seem terrified.

CUT TO :

A WIDE SHOT:  of RAKE, and the frightened ANIMALS, from

two hundred yards away. THE CAMERA MOVES IN, slowly at

first, then gaining speed... extraordinary SPEED. We are

seeing THROUGH THE EYES OF... whatever it is that's running,

charging, SLATHERING HUNGRILY...

...reaching the corral, DARTING through the fence, past the

KICKING HORSES, and LEAPING at Rake, who whirls around...and

CRIES OUT in pain as his flashlight BLINDS us with WHITENESS.

EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN

The WHITENESS becomes the GLARE of HALOGEN LIGHTS. We are

overwhelmed by the SOUND of AIRCRAFT ENGINES. We see MEN,

armed SOLDIERS, scrambling into combat HELICOPTERS.

A RADIO MAN runs right toward THE CAMERA, holding out an

open receiver.

Pg-7

ANOTHER MAN, in the foreground, takes the radio-phone. We

can't see his face. Only his forearm, which bears A TATTOO

of a grinning SKULL.

INT   AN OFFICE   DAWN

A SUIT talks on a red telephone. Once again, we see no face.

An ostentatious diamond RING kicks light as the man snips off

the end off a Monte Cristo.

The flame from a wooden match lights the Monte Cristo.

EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN

THE TATTOOED MAN runs off to join the other SOLDIERS.

INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING

CHRIS sleeps. JILL is awake, deep in thought, when...

...BRRRRT! It's not a ring, it's a vibration. Jill reaches

down and extracts something small and black, the size of a

box of Tic-Tacs, from one of her shoes. She gets out of bed,

checking to see that Chris is still asleep, and moves into...

Pg-8

INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   BATHROOM   MORNING

...a bathroom. Closing the door behind her, she puts the

small box to her ear, extracts a wire from it, with a tiny

microphone on its tip, and...

We can't hear the voice that speaks to her.

JILL pulls a small ENVELOPE from a toiletry bag. She breaks

open a wax seal...and takes out a thick paper on which is

printed... 29-RC-6735.

Jill clicks off. She dumps something else from the envelope

into her hand... A BLUE PLASTIC CARD, the size of a Visa,

blank except for a mag-stripe. There's a small hole in one

corner, through which a chain is strung. Jill slings the

chain over head, wearing the blue card like a pendant.

INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING

CHRIS is still asleep. JILL comes out of the bathroom and

looks down at him longingly.  Should she wake him?  Tell him

what's happening?  She wants to, but duty prevents it.  She

pulls herself away.

INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   CLOSET   MORNING

TCHIK TCHIK TCHIK...JILL pushes aside hangers which hold her

clothes. She types numbers into a hidden KEYPAD. A SECRET

PANEL OPENS, revealing a CLOSET WITHIN THE CLOSET, packed

with COMBAT UNIFORMS and WEAPONS.

INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING

The sound... TCHUNG... of the front door closing snaps CHRIS

awake.  His first thought is for his lover.  He reaches out

and finds that... she's not in bed.  He jumps up, rushes to

a window, looks down, from the second story, and sees...

Pg-9

EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING

...JILL, heavily ARMED, in UNIFORM, wearing a beret that has

an insignia... S.T.A.R.S. She rushes down the front path and

jumps into A HUMMER with THREE OTHER TROOPERS on board. The

vehicle pulls instantly away...

...leaving Chris, looking through the window, puzzled, angry,

and very much wounded.

INT/EXT   HUMMER   MORNING

RUSSO drives. WILLIAMS and DISIMONE sit in the back, all

tough Special-Forces types. JILL, in the front passenger

seat, though the only female, ranks the highest.

Jill points into THE ARKLEY FOREST which lies ahead. Miles

of old growth-trees shrouded in a ghostly morning mist.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT   THE FOREST   MORNING

DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE MIST... THE HUMMER bounces over

non-roads and stops fifty yards from...

...A PAIR OF IRON GATES, each wrought with the letter "A".

Beyond, the shifting fog offers momentary glimpses of...

A MANSION.  Huge.  Like Xandau.  THE TROOPERS, amazed,

climb out and approach the gates.

Pg-10

A deep, animal SNARL comes from the woods.  The troopers

raise their weapons as they peer into the underbrush.  The

fog keeps sunlight from penetrating.  The forest is a maze

of dark shadows. Leaves flutter.  Limbs SNAP.  Then...

DARK SHAPES can be seen moving, circling.  A half-dozen

of them.  Maybe more.  Jill whips out a transmitter and

quickly types an access code.

KRITCH! Something LEAPS out of the brush. Automatic

WEAPONS SPIT reflexively.

KRITCH KRITCH KRITCH...more lunging SHAES appear. The

troopers scatter, firing, as they are attacked from all

sides. Jill dives for the shrubbery, shouting into her

transmitter.

CUT TO :

INT   HUEY   MORNING

JILL'S VOICE stutters over a headset which is pressed against

A MAN'S EAR.

Pg-11

Static. Hissing air. The SHOT WIDENS as the man lowers his

headset. First we see the TATTOO on his arm... a grinning

SKULL which we recognize. Then, gradually, we see his face.

Lean and mean, wearing dark sunglasses, this is ALBERT

WESKER, a hard-assed career officer.

The pilot, LAGUARDIA, responds.

Oddly, Wesker smiles.

There are three other MEN on board. The closest to Wesker

is BARRY BURTON, a muscular black man, as big as a grizzly,

with the heart of a Teddy.

Wesker and the men fly from the lens.  THE CAMERA passes

Out through one of the helicopter's windows as the chopper soars

away.  When the SHOT WIDENS, we see OTHER HUEYS...black,

unmarked, keeping formation.  Three... six...ten of them.

EXT   FOREST   MORNING

GUNS BLAZE. THE TROOPERS are under assault by thrashing,

inhuman SHAPES...GROWLING, SNAPPING. JILL rolls into a

natural trench.  DISIMONE is behind her, WILLIAMS is

crawling just ahead, his legs pumping.  Jill scoots past

him and sees that...

...those legs aren't moving on their own.  They've been

RIPPED AWAY FROM WILLIAMS' TORSO and are being dragged into

the underbrush by some... BEAST... concealed in the thick

brush, so we never get a clear look at it.

OTHER BEASTS attack DiSimone.  Then Russo.  We see only

details.  Jill fires her pistol, point blank... to no avail.

RED-RIMMED EYES, SNARLING JAWS, DROOLING TEETH descend on

her as we CUT TO:

Pg-12

EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT BUILDING   MORNING

CHRIS steps out of Jill's building. Suddenly, incongruously,

camo-painted HUEYS swoop down out of the sky.

EXT   RACCOON CITY   MAIN STREET   MORNING

THE CHOPPERS land where they can. COMMANDOS leap out and

begin to cordon off the town.  Bullhorns blare.

BULLHORN

There's been an accident in the

hills nearby. A military aircraft,

carrying live weapons, has crashed...

EXT   RACCOON CITY   SIDE STREET   MORNING

CHRIS runs down a side-street into AN ALLEY, where he's

trapped by COMMANDOS, both in front and behind.

Chris swallows his fury. Gritting his teeth, he goes along

with the soldiers, prodded, by rifle barrels, out onto...

EXT   RACCOON CITY  MAIN STREET   MORNING

...Main Street, where there is CHAOS... an Orwellian sight,

as CITIZENS find themselves horded into helicopters and

TRUCKS from the local National Guard Post.

A sweating man, still in his pajamas, rushes up to the

SOLDIERS that are escorting CHRIS.

Pg-13

The soldier lifts his rifle. He's about to CLUB the sheriff

when Chris lunges, grabbing his arm. WHOOMPH! Chris kicks

the soldier in the balls. The man buckles. Chris bolts.

One of the other commandos FIRES at him, a loud BURST which

misses Chris but SHATTERS a shop window, setting off wild

PANIC on the street. Chris ducks into a building...

EXT   RACCOON CITY   BACK STREET   MORNING

...and out a rear door. He runs through a warren of back

alleyways, arriving at...

...A JEEP SAHARA which is parked behind Jill's apartment

building. He jumps in without opening the door, jams the key

into the ignition, and ROARS off.

INT   HUEY   MORNING

Still airborne, in one of the black helicopters that have yet

to reach the site, WESKER barks orders into a radio.

EXT   FARM   MORNING

CHRIS rumbles his jeep onto a picturesque FARM, secluded deep

in the forest. We don't recognize it immediately. It was

dark when we last saw the place.

Jumping out, Chris sees three large SHAPES lying in the grass

of a corral. Rushing over, Chris realizes...

...they're HORSES. One of them is LUCKY, his prize

stallion... DEAD, in a pool of BLOOD, with its belly torn

open and a huge chunk out of its neck.

Pg-14

Chris hears a weak, MOANING SOUND. He turns and sees...

RAKE, lying near a water pump. Chris rushes to the man's

side and finds him brutally SLASHED, barely clinging to life.

Examining the man's wounds, Chris realizes they're fatal.

There's a THUNDER in the sky. Chris looks up. Wesker's

Fleet of black HUEYS appears on the horizon.  They split up,

Seven banking off toward Raccoon City, the remaining three

grinding ahead over the forest, slowing down, dropping in

altitude.

Chris looks back down at the old man, who is drifting,

starting to lose it.

Pg-15

Chris jumps to his feet and runs into...

INT   FARMHOUSE   MORNING

...the great-room of the FARMHOUSE. Rustic. Cozy. CHRIS

snatches up a telephone. There's no dial-tone. The line

is dead. Chris rushes to a gun cabinet and pulls out an old

WINCHESTER rifle. He scoops ammo from a drawer into a

shoulder bag and runs back outside...

EXT   FARM   MORNING

...where his eyes catch MOVEMENT in the corral. LUCKY,

entrails spilling, is trying to stand.

Chris shoulders his ammo bag, reaches inside, and quickly

reloads the Winchester. Stepping forward, he aims carefully.

BLAM!  A clean shot to the horse's brain drops the animal.

It takes Chris a long moment to recover... then, he looks into

the trees. The helicopters are no longer in sight, but their

THUNDER remains.  They haven't landed yet.

Chris turns and rushes back to Rake's side, only to find...

...he has died. Chris' jaws tighten, but he has no time

to mourn. He closes Rake's eyes. Digs through the grass.

Pulls up a handful of dirt. Stuffs it into the old man's

hand, and closes his stiffening fingers over it.

Conquering his emotions, Chris runs to his jeep and jumps in.

He shifts into four-wheel-drive and, ignoring the road, heads

straight over the field for the trees.

As the jeep disappears, THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN, ZOOMING

IN ON...

Pg-16

...one of the farm dogs. The SPANIEL. Not the entire

animal, but one of its three SEPARATE PARTS... it's front

end... CRUSHED head, BLOODY neck, and a single BROKEN paw...

...which is trying to CRAWL.

Fifty yards away, RAKE'S HAND relaxes. The earth spills out

through his fingers as the dead man's eyes... POP OPEN.

EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MORNING

THE FIRST OF THE BLACK HUEYS drops, hazardously, into a

small clearing with barely enough space. Unable to land

on the scrub-brush, it hovers ten feet off the ground. Its

rotors CLIP TREE LEAVES as WESKER, BARRY, and TWO OTHER

S.T.A.R.S. COMMANDOS jump out, heavily armed. The chopper

lifts off, placed by HUEY NUMBER TWO.

NOT FAR AWAY, CHRIS navigates through undergrowth until he

can see THE HELICOPTERS through the trees. The THUNDER from

their rotors masks the grinding of Chris' jeep. He pulls

within a hundred yards and, leaving his vehicle in the bush,

moves closer, cautiously, on foot.

THE THIRD HUEY air-drops TWO MEN and TWO WOMEN in S.T.A.R.S.

uniforms. There are TWELVE COMMANDOS in all... ALPHA TEAM.

Wesker looks up at the Huey's PILOT, using his radio to speak

to the man.

A "Roger that", squaks back as the Huey banks away.

Barry looks worried. His instincts are asking... "We might

need... 'help'".  Against what? We only see this in his eyes,

he says nothing as...

...Wesker leads the team through the woods, unaware of...

...CHRIS, following behind, crouching around trees and

bushes, not a trained commando, but comfortable with the

land, a natural warrior using ancestral instincts.

THE CAMERA TRACKS COMBAT BOOTS as they CRUNCH through the

low-Lying MIST.. .stopping abruptly when they encounter...

...WEAPONS, AMMO BELTS, bits of SHRDDED UNIFORMS... and

HUMAN BODY PARTS... strewn all through the surrounding brush,

remnants of what was obviously a feeding-frenzy.

Pg-17

BRAD VICKERS vomits. Unarmed, he's Alpha Team's computer-

techie. Not a combat soldier, he's a bit of a coward.

Another non-combatant, REBECCA CHAMBERS, is the team's

medical officer. She digs an ammonia capsule from her

pack and holds it under Vickers' nose.

RICHARD AIKEN and KENNETH SULLIVAN are buddies, regular

G.I. Joes, right out of every war movie. Aiken stares at

the carnage, calmly chewing a wad of gum.

ROSIE RODRIGUEZ, a tough, body-built babe steps in.

FOREST SPEYER, a wiry Willem Defoe type, finds a bloody BERET

and brings it to Wesker.  There's an I.D. tag on the brim...

In the bushes, Chris overhears, not wanting to believe. He

sees Wesker angrily pitch Jill's beret into the brush.

Wesker advances his troops. When the coast is clear, Chris

rushes in, picks up the beret, and sees the name tag for

himself. "Valentine ".

After what happened at the farm... now this... feeling sucker-

punched, defeated, Chris hangs his head.

One of the HUEYS dips in low.

Pg-18

Chris looks up. The sight of the war machine lifts him from

defeat... to rage.  His eyes are soft, for the last time, as

he tucks Jill's beret into his pack.  When he looks up again,

those eyes have become newly predatory.  He ducks out of

sight as the helicopter swings lower.

Downdraft from the rotors makes the bushes rustle, catching

Chris' attention.  He realizes that... it's not just the wind.

The shrubs are being disturbed by...

SOMETHING DARK which is moving through them.  It pokes

its head out.  A WOLF! Rake was right.  Chris readies his

Winchester as the animal stalks forward.

It's not a wolf. It's A DOG. Mottled, its flesh gray,

covered with rotting lesions... and it has three bleeding

BULLET HOLES in its belly, chest, neck.

GROWRRR!  It LEAPS at Chris... who fires... BLAM!

Up ahead, Wesker and his commandos freeze.

Before anyone can answer, the team is ATTACKED by MORE DOGS

which BURST out of the surrounding woods...DOBERMANS and

SHEPHERDS... but something is seriously wrong with all of

them. Their EYES are DEAD, their FLESH decaying.

Automatics piss streams of lead. Hot rounds TEAR through the

animals, many of the slugs accidentally blowing out brains.

of his bullets hits its target... one of the dogs' heads.

The commandos are backed up against... the IRON GATES we

saw earlier. The Arkley Mansion stands beyond.

The dogs don't stand a chance. Alpha Team's firepower is

overwhelming. But there is a human casualty. JOSEPH FROST

trips and falls. One of the dogs POUNCES on him, chewing

out his HEART... through his BACK.

Wesker steps in, RIDDLING the dead man, and the dog, with

forty rounds from his M-16.

Pg-19

In the next instant, ANOTHER DOG LEAPS at Wesker from behind.

He hears its snarl... too late.  He dives into the grass...

too late.  The dog is about to land on him when...

...it's BLASTED out of mid air by... Barry.

Wesker stand, straightening his ever-present sunglasses.

Wesker checks his equipment belt. Something is missing.

He looks to where he rolled in the grass. Using a FLASH-

LIGHT, he finds...

...a small electronic unit the size of a cell-phone. But

it's not a cell-phone. Whatever it is... Wesker clips it

onto his belt.

FROM THE BRUSH, Chris sees all this. The guns have gone

silent. The attack seems to be over. Chris moves stealthily

to the body of the animal that he shot. It's wearing a

COLLAR which reads...

Alongside the I.D., there's a corporate-looking logo... the

symbol of an UMBRELLA.

GRRROWWWLL! ANOTHER DOG is advancing on Chris. He aims

his Winchester.  CLICK! The magazine is empty.  No time to

reload.  The dog is on him.  Chris SCRAMBLES away.  The dog

BOUNDS after him.

Chris drops to the ground.  Did he trip?  No.  He pushes a

TREE ROOT, which is FALSE.  It swings open and he dives in,

pulling the root shut over him.

The dog arrives an instant later.  It lets out an angry

howl... and is BLOWN AWAY... by RODRIGUEZ, who neither saw

Chris, nor where he went.

The forest goes dead quiet.  Too quiet.  There's not even

the chirping of morning birds Wesker is SLAPPED startlingly

on the back... by Barry.

Pg-20

Wesker pulls a chain from under his shirt. It holds a card,

the size of a Visa, like the one Jill found in her secret

envelope, only Wesker's isn't blue, it's green.

Stepping away from Barry, he slide the card through a slot

in the iron gate-frame.  BUZZZZ.  The GATES SWING OPEN with

a rusty SQUEAL.

INT   TUNNEL   MORNING

CHRIS crawls through a long, dark shaft with earthen walls,

a man-made tunnel.

EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MANSION   MORNING

AT THE MANSION'S FRONT DOOR, a hand-carved monolith of solid

oak, WESKER finds another hidden SLOT and swipes his card.

The giant door CREAKS OPEN.

INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING

INSIDE, the place looks like a HAUNTED HOUSE, a glorious

ruin, once spectacular, now mysterious and threatening.

The chandeliers and furniture are covered with sheets that

ripple on breezes from a thousand faults in the old walls.

Indistinct NOISES echo within the ceiling, the floor, as

ALPHA TEAM enters.

WESKER shuts the front door. The BOOMING SOUND makes us

wonder if we will ever see it opened again.

Pg-21

INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   MORNING

Though it's still morning, the windows are sealed over.  No

sunshine can enter. From this point on... there will be no

indication of time... except as shown on clocks.  A sense of

dread takes hold of us as...

...dark SHADOWS LURCH...FEET SCRAPE sluggishly... not in

combat boots, but in Nikes, loafers, Dr. Martens... past an

accordion GATE of corroded bronze.  A motor HUMS.  Behind

the gate, an old-fashioned service ELEVATOR rises... but stops

just below floor level. EYES peer out, waiting for the

shuffling feet to pass.  Then the car rises the rest of

the way, revealing its occupant...

Pg-22

...JILL VALENTINE! She's alive! She deactivates the

elevator by pulling her blue ACCESS CARD out of an incon-

gruously modern receptacle. Checking to be sure that the

coast is clear, she slides the accordion gate aside and

steps out into the corridor.

With a ghostly MOAN, something LUNGES at her out of the

shadows. It's A MAN in a lab coat. His skin is ROTTING,

his teeth SNAPPING, like the dogs'. He tries to BITE Jill,

not merely to do injury. He seems HUNGRY!

Jill leaps aside, lifting her pistol and FIRING... once,

twice, three times. The man is shot in the stomach, heart,

neck...but he keeps coming! Finally, Jill shoots him in the

head...and he falls.

Jill quickly reloads, on instinct. But as she does it, she

stares at the corpse, frowning, weighing life-long belief

against the hideous facts of the moment.

INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING

WESKER and his troopers hear the GUNSHOTS. There are THREE

DOORS nearby. Wesker selects one that seems to lead to the

source of the gunshots. Using his card, he unlocks it.

Wesker grins, but hardly skips a beat.

The troop moves out. Aiken and Sullivan remain in the

central hall with Rebecca.

Pg-23

Sullivan catches Rebecca's eye.

INT   MANSION LIBRARY   TIMELESS

WESKER leads his TROOP into an enormous, cobwebbed library

lined with book shelves, but no books. There are doorways

on all four walls. Wesker pulls out something that looks

like a Game-Boy. He types on a keypad. A MAP of the mansion

appears. Wesker scrolls with the arrow-keys. Barry looks

on very impressed with the high-tech unit.

Wesker doesn't answer. He pockets the "Game Boy".

Wesker, leads his squad through one of the doorways. RIDLEY,

a young rookie, remains.

INT   UNDERGROUND CAVERN   TIMELESS

CHRIS reaches the end of the earthen tunnel. There are

signs that children once played here... TOY SOLDIERS.

GRAFFITI.  Chris finds his nickname... Christopher Reddy...

etched in hardened mud.  After a moment of reflection,

he moves on, into...

INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS

...a small, sheet-rock chamber.  CHRIS rushes to a DOOR

that looks like it's been there since the beginning of time.

As soon as he touches the knob... AN ALARM SOUNDS!

INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

RIDLEY, standing guard, hears THE ALARM. He hears Chris

JIGGLING the knob. But he sees NO DOOR. The walls around

him seem to be solid slabs.

Pg-24

INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS

CHRIS can't get the doorknob to turn. Behind him, a dusty

ORIENTAL CARPET BULGES upward. One corner flops aside.

INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

RIDLEY is spooked by the sound. Frightened, trembling,

he un-slings his rifle.

INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS

CHRIS doesn't hear the trooper. Behind him, A Decomposed

HAND pokes out of a drainage ditch beneath the carpet. It

gropes. Finds purchase on the floor.

Chris is unaware of the danger. He HURLS himself against

the door. He can't break through.

The thing that climbs out of the ditch was once a man, once

a SCIENTIST. It's wearing a lab coat and a pair of thick

EYEGLASSES. But it's long dead. It's... A ZOMBIE.

As it pulls itself up, its eyeglasses strike the side of the

ditch. They fall, CLATTERING, the rims scraping the zombie's

cheek, which peels away like onion skin.

Chris hears the noise. Turns and sees...

...the dead man, reaching out hungrily.  Chris is trapped.

He aims his Winchester. CLICK! He forgot. It's empty.

The zombie pulls itself fully up onto the floor. Chris digs

in his shoulder bag. Pulls out a handful of bullets and with

them, accidentally, Jill's BERET. Rising emotion stops him

for a moment.

The dead man crawls toward him. Chris might not have time

to load. As he tries to jam a bullet into his rifle, the

zombie SWATS at him.  Catches the beret.  Looks at it.

Sniffs it.  The bullet pops out of Chris' nervous fingers.

He tries to load another.

INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

RIDLEY spots A BLUE ACCESS SLOT in the wall. He levels his

automatic and CHEWS the thing up with a short burst.

A PANEL SWINGS OPEN! CHRIS dives out... with the ZOMBIE

inches behind him. Ridley FIRES off another BURST OF ROUNDS.

Pg-25

Stray bullets PIERCE the zombie's head. It drops back into

the chamber...with Ridley never knowing why.

Ridley and Chris look at each other, asking rapid-fire

questions, none of them answered.

WHAM! ANOTHER ZOMBIE appears suddenly behind Ridley, BITING

out the muscle between his shoulder and neck. The trooper

stands, stunned, for a moment...

...then he drops..

The zombie, in a uniform, once a security guard, gazes dully

at Chris.  A wet sound comes from inside its gullet as it

calmly chews on Ridley's flesh.  Swallowing, it reaches out.

Chris grabs its arms, FLINGS it into the chamber. Then

FIRES his Winchester, once, putting a HOLE in the thing's

head. Chris slams the door.

INT   MANSION   DINING ROOM   TIMELESS

In a Hearst-sized dining room with draped furniture, WESKER

and the OTHER TROOPERS have heard the new gunfire.

Pg-26

INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

CHRIS hears the CLATTERING of the troopers heading his way.

What he doesn't hear is... a slight CRACKLING... in the walls.

INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS

WESKER and his TEAM burst into the corridor with the old-

fashioned ELEVATOR.  FLASHLIGHTS find... the body of the

ZOMBIE that was shot by Jill, bullet HOLES allover its body.

INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

CHRIS checks Ridley.  No pulse.  His own rustling movements

prevent him from hearing... that soft CRACKLING SOUND.

The kitchen is lined with fifty-year-old IVY-PATTERNED

WALLPAPER.  The printed VINES seem to be MOVING!  Chris

doesn't notice until the vines begin to WIGGLE furiously...

and RIP THROUGH the paper.  They're REAL.  Sprouts from

some sort of exotic plant, that have climbed up the walls...

with INTELLIGENCE!  They seem aware of Chris' presence.

REBECCA has appeared in an open doorway. Chris looks at her,

with the tips of the vines beginning to brush his shoulders.

Pg-27

Chris, familiar with the room, opens a SMALL DOOR in the

wall, barely man-sized, and almost invisible because it's

covered in matching wallpaper. Chris dives in.

AIKEN and SULLIVAN pop up behind Rebecca, having barely

caught a glimpse of Chris.

Sullivan points at the vines... which are swirling, groping,

as if alive, making their way toward Ridley's body.

INT  MANSION   CHUTE   TIMELESS

In a LAUNDRY CHUTE, propping himself against the sides,

CHRIS descends...down...down... as he did as a child...

and comes out onto...

INT   CRAWL SPACE   TIMELESS

...a DROP-CEILING, newly installed. Iron frames support

AIR-FILTRATION SYSTEMS and other heavy MACHINERY. Sheet-

metal walls have replaced the old soffit and fascia. LIGHT,

from somewhere below, knifes through gridded iron vents.

INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

The VINES continue to advance.

THE TROOPERS rush to retrieve RIDLEY'S BODY. The VINES hover

around them, occasionally DARTING, then pulling back, as if

they were timid animals, hungry, but afraid of anew food-

dish. When AIKEN brandishing his M-16, the VINES RECOIL and

RETRACT fully... THWIP THWIP THWIP... behind the wallpaper and

down... somewhere into the bowels of the house.

Pg-28

INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS

THE OTHERS are still puzzling over the DOWNED ZOMBIE.

Barry steps closer to the corpse, notes its collapsed skull.

Wesker has been exploring the corridor. Stopping in front

of the elevator, he shines his light into the car. We expect

someone... or some-thing... to be lurking inside.

An attack comes from the opposite direction. A FIGURE BURSTS-

out of the shadows behind Weasker. Another Zombie?  No.  It's

JILL! In a rage, she holds her pistol to Wesker's head.

Instead, Jill CLICKS the hammer back.

Jill blinks. Slowly, reluctantly, she lowers her gun.

Pg-29

Wesker turns... and recognizes her.

A VOICE interrupts, from the end of the corridor.

The voice is SULLIVAN'S. The troopers run to join him.

Last to leave the corridor are Wesker and Jill. Wesker

gestures gallantly.

INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

The TROOPERS trickle into the kitchen to find... REBECCA,

kneeling over RIDLEY'S CORPSE, examining the ragged bite

on its neck.

Rebecca looks up. The two women make sisterly eye-contact.

Pg-30

Rodriguez cringes when she finds a ragged hole in the wall-

paper near where she's standing.

WESKER pulls off his dark glasses for the first time.

Pg-31

Wesker hangs his head. It's an affirmation.

Pg-32

The troopers fall silent as all this sinks in.

With a lightning move, Wesker draws his pistol and...BLAM!

FIRES... at Rebecca. She flinches. The bullet flies past

her and SHATTERS the skull of RIDLEY, the dead trooper who,

having stood up, was about to attack Rebecca from behind.

Ridley drops... dead again.

Rebecca turns and looks at the blood-splattered body.

Vickers reaches in Rebecca's bag, pulls out an ammonia

capsule, cracks it, and holds it under her nose.

INT   CRAWL-SPACE   TIMELESS

CHRIS crawls across the drop-ceiling, into the up-rising

light from one of the vents. He looks down through the

grid work and sees...

...the same LABORATORY that was behind Marcus in the opening

video. No longer pristine, it's wrecked, torn apart. Files

are scattered everywhere along with smashed fragments of

furniture and computer hardware.

CAGES that line the walls are filled with LAB ANIMALS making

NERVOUS CHATTER. Chris watches a MONKEY sip water from a

dish. Like the other animals, its skin is rotting.

Pg-33

Chris is about to move on, when his eye catches...

...MOVEMENT... outside the cages.  There's A MAN, in a

lab coat, sitting at a desk, writing on a note pad.

CLOSE ON: the man's HAND... flaking, decomposing.  The pen

it holds is making only random, erratic marks.

The man turns his head, slowly, to look up toward the voice.

There's NOTHING left of his FACE. RAW TISSUE seeps odd-

colored fluids. A single eyeball is nested tenuously in

the ooze. Something like a mouth, recognizable only because

of its position, opens... and GROANS.

Chris, pumping his Winchester, hears... KRANG! A NOISE from

below. He looks down again, just as...

...the lab door BURSTS open. WESKER and ALPHA TEAM stream

into the lab. The thing with. the destroyed face turns toward

the invaders, stands, and shuffles toward them.

Without hesitation, Wesker, on point, FIRES a quick burst

into the thing's brain. It drops like a sack. The lab

animals SHRIEK.

The team files in, not noticing... ANOTHER ZOMBIE... crawling

across the floor...heading directly for SPEYER. Chris shouts

He punches out the grate with the barrels of his rifle

and... BLAM!...punches a sure-fire HOLE in the zombie's head.

BRAD VICKERS, his nerves badly frayed, thinks the team is

being attacked. He SPRAYS the ceiling with his automatic.

Chris ducks and rolls, narrowly escaping the initial barrage,

but bullets keep coming, punching a dotted line up through

the ceiling panels.

Chris scrambles, as fast as he can, his feet barely escaping

the punch holes.

He finds himself on top of an enormous checkerboard of vents

and Plexiglas panels. Bullets weaken the framework. It

sags... then CRACKS, dropping away. Chris is plunged into...

Pg-34

INT   LAB   LEVEL "A" TIMELESS

...WATER! CHRIS kicks, paddles with his rifle, righting

himself, getting his bearings. He's in a huge AQUARIUM

that's built into one of the laboratory's walls... and he's

not alone. There are SIX SHARKS in the tank. ZOMBIE SHARKS,

their flesh rotting, leaking pus.

The largest of them SNAPS at Chris, but its jaws catch only

a clump of his swirling hair. Chris kicks with his feet,

remaining upright, and FIRES his wet Winchester.

The bullet wimps-out, restrained by the water. It penetrates

the shark, but barely. We can see the casing lodged in the

animal's flesh.

Chris gets an idea. He kicks forward. Plants the barrel

of his Winchester directly against the aquarium glass...

only to find himself aiming directly at...

...JILL, who is aiming back at him with her M-16. They're

both stunned. They stare at each other for a moment, like

gunfighters, until...

...another shark circles in for an attack. Chris swings the

Winchester away from Jill and FIRES underwater. The aquarium

glass CRACKS... but holds.

Jill FIRES. More CRACKS, but the glass is resistant.

Chris out. Water SURGES into the lab, knocking Wesker and

some of his squad down.

They stand up again, only to find themselves knee-high in a

dark pool...with SHARK FINS slicing the surface. Everybody

opens fire. The dead fish keep coming.

In a bizarre frenzy, the sharks KICK their tails, making

startlingly quick turns, darting every which way, SNAPPING

at the scent of warm flesh. The troopers, hampered by the

water, SPLASH around wildly, many of them nearly getting

bitten. The air above thickens with a fog of graphite from

ten spitting automatics.

Pg-35

The water gets darker as it becomes clouded with BLOOD. But

thankfully, the level is dropping. The water is seeping out

through GRATES in the floor. The sharks become more visible,

moving slower as their bellies scrape the floor.

The troopers pick them off, one by one. The immediate threat

passes...but as the water drains away, the troopers become

aware of... a KLAXON-LIKE SOUND. ANOTHER ALARM. The entry

door glides shut with a BOOOMMM!

Wesker, looking crazed, his sunglasses gone, is typing on

his "Game-Boy"... getting no response.

Rosie finds Sullivan looking at her curiously.

Wesker FLINGS his "Game-Boy" angrily against a wall. It

shatters into bits.

Pg-36

Wesker bristles. He's about to confront Chris, but he spots

his sunglasses where they were deposited on a floor grate by

the water. He walks over and picks them up, wiping the

lenses on his shirt. Without looking at Chris, he asks...

Chris spots a dry lab-coat hanging on a wall hook. He takes

it down and uses it to dry his rifle.

Wesker, while seeming to understand, still doesn't look up.

A snappy argument develops, a lover's quarrel, with higher-

than-normal stakes.

Pg-37

Barry is stooped over the faceless zombie that Wesker shot.

He rips an I.D. badge from the corpse's coat.  He tosses it

to Wesker, who reads the I.D... "DR. J. MARCUS"

BRAD has been quietly working at one of the lab's computers.

Barry rushes over and looks at the monitor screen.

Wesker steps in for a look.

Chris calmly retrieves his wet shoulder bag from the floor.

He wrings out the cloth and, using the lab coat, wipes the

bullets dry.

Pg-38

Everyone's ears perk.

Jill looks at Chris. Catches him weighing options.

Wesker looks at Chris with that odd, confident smile.

Chris points at the broken grid above the shattered aquarium.

Pg-39

Wesker looks up. Then looks back at Chris.

Brad's fingers fly. He scrolls through menus.

The young man types a command. Wesker rushes over to the

H. P. and grabs the first chart that rolls out.

Rebecca steps over to Brad. She points at his leg.  Seated

at the computer, his trousers hiked, BLOOD can be seen on his

sock, just above his boot.

Chris watches Wesker as he studies the printed charts.

Wesker, grim-faced, looks at his team.

The troopers exchange glances. Jill is first to speak.

Pg-40

Jill looks at Chris.

INT   CRAWL-SPACE   TIMELESS

One by one, the members of ALPHA TEAM wiggle up into the

crawl space above the ceiling. CHRIS climbs up behind JILL.

OTHER TROOPERS are already away, following WESKER, who guides

them with the help of his chart. Jill starts after them.

Chris grabs her arm.

He pulls her into an embrace. She goes willingly.

Pg-41

Chris pulls away from the embrace and looks at her.

Barry, having overheard, is halfway up through the grate.

Chris and Jill help Barry up into the crawl space.

start off after the troop. THE CAMERA TRACKS them.

Pg-42

UP AHEAD : WESKER reaches a service ladder. He waves his

troop on. They start to climb down.

GRRRAAAAWWWLr.! Distant... but distinct... it sounds like

the MGM lion.

Again .GRRRRRAAAAAWWWWLLLL !

INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS

The lead TROOPERS reach another section of the ceiling.

Clustering around a vent, they look down into...

...the "B"-level lab, more streamlined, more high-tech than

the one upstairs. There are large COMPUTERS, linked by

metal-shielded conduits to jacks in the walls.

Pg-43

WESKER kicks out the vent. He jumps first, through the

opening, down into the lab. CHRIS watches from behind.

Wesker grabs a desk and pushes it under the vent.  MARINI

climbs down, followed by FOX.  BRAD is last.

INT   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS

WESKER looks around. There are THREE Doorways...open wide

with only darkness beyond. Wesker runs around closing them.

FOX and MARINI take up posts. Brad lowers himself gingerly.

He drops the last two feet onto the desk, landing on his

bloody leg.

He topples, falling to the floor, but pops up instantly.

He limps over and attacks the computer keys.

GRRRRRAAAAAWWWWWLLLL! Another distant snarl.

Brad types rapidly, nervously. Flubs. Types again.

Pg-44

We HEAR it before we see it. The sound of absolute PANIC.

People SHOUTING! SCREAMING! THUDS and CRASHES! GLASS

BREAKING! Then A WOMAN'S VOICE .

Brad limps around the desk and spins the monitor for the

others to see. The WOMAN is an ORIENTAL. She's standing

in the foreground, as Marcus was in the opening video.

Behind her is a lab we haven't seen yet... with white-

coated FIGURES... RUNNING... FIRING GUNS.

W

HAM ! The woman is pushed out of the way by A MAN who is

trying to protect her from...

...SOMETHING that BLURS past the lens, like a pendulum,

from ABOVE.

In the next instant... SPLAT... the lens is COATED WITH BLOOD!

As it oozes down, we see a partial image of the same MAN.

His HEAD is OUT OF FRAME at the top of the screen.

The thing above must have a hold on it... because the man is

DANGLING, his arms witching. His back has three GOUGES in

it, long and so deep that they might have been made by

piece of heavy machinery. We only see this for an instant...

before the man is LIFTED, straight UP, with amazing SPEED.

Wesker clicks off the monitor. The other men instinctively

look up above their heads.

CRASH! The door behind Fox BURSTS open. Before he has

time to react A ZOMBIE is on him, BITING his cheek, neck,

shoulder. The two figures fall to the floor, grappling.

Wesker can't get a clean shot.

Pg-45

Marini is first to reach the desk, but he helps the limping

Brad up ahead of him. TWO MORE ZOMBIES lurch in through the

open doorway. Wesker shoots them, but he sees MORE... can't

tell how many...shambling toward the open doorway from the

darkness beyond.

Wesker focuses on Fox, who is still being MAULED, BITTEN.

Fox SCREAMS. Wesker still has no safe shot.

Brad is YANKED up into ceiling by SULLIVAN and AIKEN. CHRIS

leans out of the opening, reaching for Marini.

Wesker KICKS the mauling zombie in the head. It takes three

hard BOOTS to attract the thing's attention. When it finally

looks up at him, Wesker BLOWS out its skull.

Fox is lying on his stomach, writhing, BLEEDING profusely

from a half-dozen bites. Wesker stoops down, trying to roll

him over, lift him up. Fox resists. He's gone insane.

Chris pulls Marini up to safety. BARRY leans down through

the opening.

The zombies are heading for Wesker. There are three of them.

Barry shoots at the one in front. Misses. His second shot

hits the thing's brain.

Wesker again tries to hoist Fox who, this time rolls over on

his own. He has drawn his pistol. Before Wesker can stop

him, he eats the barrel and BLOWS out the back of his head.

One zombie is dangerously close. Barry fires two more

rounds. No head shot, but the zombie staggers and, though

not dead, FALLS...directly toward Wesker. The colonel rolls

on his back, kicking himself away, managing to get clear.

He uses his own pistol to BLAST the zombie.

He scrambles to his feet, darts toward the desk, and jumps

up. The third zombie grabs his legs. From above, Barry

risks a dangerous shot. BLAM! Wesker hears the bullet

WHIZZZ past his head like a mosquito.

The zombie is hit in the skull. It drops. There are MORE

of them coming out of the darkness. Barry takes hold of

Wesker and, with a single strong arm, pulls him up into...

INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS

...the crawl space, where WESKER breathes heavily for a

moment... then looks up at his old friend.

Pg-46

A horrible MOANING SOUND comes from below, in the lab.

THREE MORE ZOMBIES can be seen clustering around the desk,

dumbly trying to climb up, sensing the "food" above.

Wesker takes off. SPEYER, RODRIGUEZ, AIKEN and SULLIVAN are

quick to follow. The others lag behind when CHRIS says...

Chris swings his legs through the grate and JUMPS down...

INT   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS

...ONTO THE DESK. He BOOTS one of the ZOMBIES away and

tries to LEAP over the others. One of them catches his foot

in mid air. CHRIS isn't hurt, but he TOPPLES to the floor,

sprawling, losing his Winchester.

The zombies have him cornered. He crawls toward his rifle.

Reaches it. Pumps a shell into the firing chamber. Aims

at the closest of the walking dead...

...which was once a young man, a simple laborer, wearing

overalls, with a name tag...

Chris looks empathetically into the thing's dead eyes.

The zombie lumbers forward hungrily.

Pg-47

Chris has come late to the realization that these things

were once human. Now he comes late to the realization...

that they are human no longer.

The zombie grabs the barrel of the Winchester, pushing it

aside. Chris can't bring it back to bear on the monster's

head. He BLASTS a round through the thing's belly. It has

no effect. The zombie reaches for Chris' throat. Starts to

lean in to bite him.

BLAM! The thing's skull explodes. JILL has jumped down

onto the desk. She FIRES another accurate pistol round.

The SECOND ZOMBIE falls.

Jill leaps to the floor and starts to push the desk. Chris

gets to his feet, rushing in to help her. Together, they

shove the desk out from under the open ceiling grate.

Jill nods toward the open doorway. There are more stuttering

FIGURES approaching out of the dark.

With a startling SOUND, A DARK SHAPE swing down from above

and GRABS Jill! Is it the thing we saw on the video?

No. It's BARRY! His mighty arms lift Jill. She's caught

by Aiken and Sullivan and pulled up to safety. Barry grabs

Chris and lifts him as well.

INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS

CHRIS grabs the edge of the grate and pulls himself up.

He reaches back down through the opening. Below, BARRY

squats... and makes a mighty leap-with his muscular legs.

Chris grabs his arms... and is nearly pulled back down.

Pg-48

Jill grabs on, then Sullivan. But one of the ZOMBIES has

reached Barry. It GRABS his kicking legs. It's TEETH SNAP!

And CATCH! The commandos lift Barry clear, but the zombie

ends up with a CHUNK of something in its mouth.

Barry checks his leg. His trousers are torn, but...

They crawl away. The zombies below reach up, their fingers

clutching, at the ceiling, but with the desk gone, there's

no way they can get up.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT   STORAGE AREA   TIMELESS

THE COMMANDOS climb down a steel access ladder into a storage

room stacked with CRATES and CARTONS. There's only one door.

The place seems secure.

WESKER sits on a crate and pulls out his printed charts.

Gradually the whole troop makes it down into the room.

They relax. A few light cigarettes. But not SPEYER.

Pg-49

Speyer pulls out his radio and starts to punch a code.

Wesker reaches down to the electronic unit that he lost and

retrieved in the woods. He pulls a long wire out of it, with

a small sensor on the end.

He jams the little sensor into his ear and pushes a button

on the belt unit. Small red LIGHTS blink.

Wesker looks over the tops of his sunglasses... at Speyer

Speyer hesitates. Wesker explodes, for the first time.

Shocked silence. Sullivan is the first to speak.

Jill steps over to Speyer and takes the radio from him.

EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   IN THE AIR   DAY

WHAP WHAP WHAP... one HUEY is in the air..., THE CAMERA MOVES IN

on a window. LAGUARDIA is flying, his RADIO MAN beside him.

The radio man presses his headset to his ear. LaGuardia

looks on apprehensively.

Pg-51

INT   OFFICE   TIMELESS

BRRRING! The hand with the ostentatious RING snatches a red

telephone receiver from of a desk drawer.

He listens. Once again, we don't see his face. Just his

free hand, with another Monte Cristo burning.

As the hand flicks ash, we see a sheet of paper on the desk

with a letterhead that bears... an UMBRELLA LOGO.

EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   IN THE AIR   DAY

In the HUEY, the RADIO MAN clicks off an incoming call.

The huey over flies THE MANSION which, from the air, looks as

stable as the Rock of Gibraltar.

INT   STORAGE AREA   TIMELESS

WESKER has come down off his rampage. He looks exhausted.

He also looks staunchly heroic as he speaks to his TROOP.

Wesker lifts his automatic. Speyer flinches. The action

wasn't meant as a threat. Wesker is just checking his ammo.

Pg-52

The troopers deposit their loaded clips, reloading the ones

that are half-used.

Jill has been counting the ammo clips.

Wesker's eyes dart angrily toward Chris. But he notices

Jill watching him...and he calms himself.

Pg-53

Wesker stands and opens the door.  Outside is a SERVICE

CORRIDOR with unfinished walls. Spaces between raw metal

beams are stuffed with insulation. Wesker checks the jamb

outside. It's got a lock mechanism. Blue.

The troopers drag a heavy crate over to hold the door open.

Wesker moves out. The commandos trickle after him. Chris

holds Jill behind for a moment.

Chris turns and walks off. Jill follows him out into...

INT   SERVICE CORRIDOR   TIMELESS

...the corridor. They catch up with the TROOP which is

clustered at a blind alley which has two doors.

WESKER is annoyed by the remark. Decisively, he selects one

of the doors and uses his green key card. With a BZZZZ, the

lock releases. The troop enters...

INT   SYSTEMS CENTER   TIMELESS

...a vast ROOM, fifty-by-fifty yards. It's filled with

HEATERS, AIR CONDITIONERS, WATER PUMPS. MAIN FRAMES for

the internal computer network line one wall, FUSE BOXES

and SWITCHER PANELS another. This is the systems center

for the entire facility.

There's an attendant's desk just inside the door. AIKEN

and SULLIVAN drag it over to prop the door open. It makes

Pg-54

a frightening SOUND as it scrapes the floor, echoing,

bouncing around in the large space. It prompts a response...

another of those animal-like SNARLS from somewhere in the

distance.

There are thick columns, floor to ceiling, every ten feet.

The spaces between them are very dark. It's hard to see.

WESKER and some of the OTHERS click on their FLASHLIGHTS .

Beams cut through dust.

There are ELECTRONIC HUMS.. CLICKS and CHATTERS emit from

the switchers, PINGS from the heaters, all combining to fray

everyone's nerves. Light beams dance nervously as the

commandos start out across the dark and frightening space.

Two things happen, almost at once. First.. .CHRIS notices

ELECTRIC EYES... on all of the columns.

Second. A ZOMBIE lurches around a corner and BITES a chunk

out of MARINI'S face. JILL whirls around to shoot at the

zombie, but Chris grabs her and FLATTENS her on the floor.

Marini, staggering, screaming in pain, triggers the first

electric eye. LASER BEAMS shoot in all directions, forming

a tight NET. Chris and Jill are barely beneath them.

Many of the other troopers are hit by the beams... which do

no immediate harm... but wherever they make contact, small

CYLINDERS above the electric eyes begin to HISS.

The commandos duck under the laser beams... just in time.

Jets of STEAM spout from the cylinders. It's not just hot

steam. It's ACIDIC, deadly.

Marini is hit by it. His clothes IGNITE. His flesh BOILS.

It's a horrible sight, but for the moment, the jets stop.

Pg-55

Marini is dead on his feet. When he falls, he trips another

of the laser beams. The steam jets SPOUT again. The troop

is beneath them, though many are burned by liquid drops that

spit from the nozzles.

Amazingly, the zombie has avoided contact. But as it begins

to stumble after commandos, we realize it's going to activate

the sensors again.

The zombie hits one of the laser beams. The steam HISSES

out again. The zombie is MELTED.

Chris has noticed a series of hinged panels in the floor.

Sullivan whips out a Swiss Army knife and goes to work on

the screws that hold down one of the panels. Other troopers

do the same.

Another ZOMBIE lurches out of the darkness. And ANOTHER.

Human hands work furiously, loosening screws. Panels come

up, Troopers begin to duck through the openings.

A second zombie hits a red beam. STEAM again. Chris and

Jill are spattered. Burned. But Jill bravely keeps working

with her own issued knife. She gets a panel open. As she

drops through, a third zombie triggers a burst of steam.

Chris ducks and covers.

When the jets stop, Chris begins to climb into the opening,

but one of his legs is GRABBED from behind by...

...one of the dead things which has already been MELTED!

Pg-56

Its flesh is bubbling. Bone is beginning to show. But

the acid hasn't reached its brain yet. The creature is

still alive.

Chris CRIES out. Acid from the zombie's hands is burning

his leg. The thing's lips have been eaten away, making its

teeth look frighteningly skeletal as it leans forward for a

bite of flesh. Chris jams the stock of his Winchester into

the zombie's mouth. He's able to hold the thing's head back,

but he's stuck. He can't let go.

Jill pops up out of the floor. She presses the barrel of her

own weapon into the zombie's forehead.

Chris pulls his rifle away. At the same instant, Jill FIRES.

The zombie is PROPELLED through the air. One of its flailing

arms triggers another laser beam. Chris throws himself in on

top of Jill as STEAM HISSES over them.

Twenty yards away, Wesker crawls under the cloud of acid.

Just as he climbs down through one of the openings, he feels

pressure...on his ear.

A groping zombie has accidentally hooked its fingers onto the

wire that runs from the detonator to Wesker's ear-piece.

For a breathless moment, it seems like the sensor will be

popped loose. Holding the pulse-reader in place, Wesker

twists his body, lifts his hand gun, and PUMPS THREE into

the dead thing's brain.

The zombie flops over, but its fingers cling, entangled, in

the wire. Wesker plants his pistol barrel on the knuckles

of the thing's dead hand. THREE MORE SHOTS cut through bone,

removing the fingers from the hand. The wire is freed.

Wesker dives into the opening in the floor.

INT   AIR DUCT   TIMELESS

The COMMANDOS find themselves in an AIR DUCT. No room to

stand. Hardly room to sit.

Chris looks at his rifle stock. It's corroded from the acid

in the zombie's mouth. Jill notices.

Pg-57

That distant SNARLING SOUND comes again, making Jill shiver.

The troop is strung out along the metal shaft. REBECCA

crawls among them, treating the worst burns. WESKER checks

his maps. SPEYER confronts him again.

Chris calls out from the far end of the shaft

Pg-58

Chris looks down the dim air-shaft, unable to see Wesker's

eyes, hidden by distance.. .and by his dark glasses.

Wesker moves out. The troop follows.

Chris looks at her with appreciative eyes .

INT   AIR SHAFT   TIMELESS

The light is dim at its best. Long stretches of the shaft

are pitch black, and there's a constant stream of air that

MOANS eerily. This whole mission has been like a descent

into Hell, darker and more frightening with each level down.

There are turn-offs, "T"s and "Y"s. At one point, when JILL

looks back, she finds ROSIE behind her. Chris is gone. Did

he leave to deal with the bomb?

No, but he's about to. He's at the rear of the pack, pressed

against the side-wall, waving others past.

Pg-59

Jill starts back toward Chris, but freezes.. .everyone freezes

when... the duct-work starts to PING.

BOOM! The air shaft is ROCKED, as if punched by a giant

fist. Then...the whole structure begins to SHIMMY. What

is it, an earthquake?

GRONK! A sheet-metal panel BUCKLES! Others do the same.

All along the shaft, panels begin to FOLD INWARD. Something

outside is CRUSHING the duct as if it were a giant tube of

toothpaste. And the troopers are being SQUEEZED inside.

RIVETS POP! The panels begin to SEPARATE...and large,

pulsing bits of FLESH appear! Not animal flesh. But the

flesh of A PLANT! The things that press in through the

openings are larger versions of the vines we saw in the

kitchen. Those were its fingertips. These are its ARMS.

Strong arms that are RIPPING the ductwork apart.

Chris, Rebecca, Aiken and Sullivan end up in one part of the

shaft. The rest in another... including Jill, who calls out.

The section that holds Chris' group FALLS AWAY... with a

monstrous, CRUNCHING sound.

INT   ARBORETUM   TIMELESS

CHRIS' GROUP spills out of the dangling metal, with cables

from the torn ceiling...TZZZZZT...SPARKING around them.

The troopers drop out of Hell, into...PARADISE.

An enormous HOT HOUSE, a lush, indoor JUNGLE of PLANTS,

IVIES, GRASSES. It's like a RAIN FOREST, complete with

a thick, damp MIST that makes it difficult to see. We might

be on another planet. None of the foliage seems indigenous

to Earth. There are LEAVES the size of bed sheets, FLOWERS ,

the size of armchairs. And at the center of it all, is the

mother of the deadly vines...

...PLANT 42, a monstrous schefflera, twenty times normal

size. Most of its limbs reach upward, where they have opened

CRACKS in the ceiling and walls, to stretch on into the

facility above. There are also dozens of shorter, beefier

"arms", each of which act independently, like tentacles on

an octopus... and each has a large, drooling POD at its tip.

Pg-60

INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS

BURSTS OF GUNFIRE from three M-16s shatter our ears... and

a ceiling VENT. WESKER and THE OTHERS jump down into...

...a very unusual CORRIDOR. It seems to stretch forever, in

both directions. It has no doors, no visible means of exit

or entry. The walls are made-up of multi-colored polymer

TILES, whose irregular shapes fit together like a JIGSAW

PUZZLE. The floor is HEAVY STEEL, though faceted. It seem

designed to shift. The whole corridor looks like it might be

able to bend, to change position, like an airport jet way.

There are disconcerting signs of damage...claw-like GOUGES on

the tiles, clean cut HOLES punched through the metal ceiling,

larger in diameter than any that might have been caused by

bullets.

And there are smears of BLOOD everywhere, as if some terrible

battle... or battles...took place here.

Wesker trots off. Vickers and Rodriguez follow. Speyer and

Barry hang back... with Jill, who remains torn.

Jill wrestles with her emotions but, in the end, dutifully,

she "falls in".

As the troopers move off, we hear odd SCRATCHING SOUNDS...

with the high-pitched SQUEAL of metal-on-metal.

Pg-61

INT   ARBORETUM  TIMELESS

The beefy "ARMS" of PLANT 42 undulate overhead as CHRIS and

his COMPANIONS look for an exit.

The plant seems to behave intelligently, with caution. The

pods on its "arms" dart, almost as if sniffing... then pull

back...like the vines in the kitchen, like timid animals.

Chris spots A DOORWAY.

As the others follow him, one of the pods swoops down in

front of REBECCA, and doesn't withdraw. It hovers there.

Its follicle's open like jaws, which display serrated daggers

of cartilage that look like teeth. Inside, a pulsing calyx

emits a pistil that twitches and swells.

ANOTHER POD swoops down on Sullivan's back. Its BEAK clamps

onto the flesh between his shoulder blades. It's PISTIL

shoots out like a hypodermic needle, stabs him and, within

the blink of an eye, SUCKS out every ounce of the man's

blood. His skin turns the color of PARCHMENT, FLAKING OFF

HIM like powder, as he dies.

Aiken rushes to his buddy's side.

Chris launches himself off a stone retaining wall around one

of the gardens. Leaping up, he grabs one of the SPARKING

CONDUITS and pulls it down.

Pg-62

Chris ends up having to shoulder Aiken out of the way.

Tendrils from the plant very nearly get both of them, but

Chris manages to JAM the semi-rigid conduit into a pool of

sprinkler-fed WATER around the plant's roots.

A BRIGHT CURRENT stutters through every vine. The plant

SHRIEKS, hideously, as electricity causes fluids to SQUIRT

from boils that develop on its flesh, down along its "arms",

and into its blood-sucking pods...which FLOP, lifeless, to

the floor, with the same sort of liquid SMACKS that human

skulls might make.

Enraged, Aiken draws a long-bladed KNIFE and wildly attacks

the remains of Plant 42, slashing at the thing's dead limbs,

not stopping until he cuts into...

...something that looks like a vine...but BLEEDS RED!

Aiken traces the thing with his eyes, up to where it's

coiled in high tree branches. It's the oversized body...

...of A COPPERHEAD, with a belly SIX FEET in diameter.

As Aiken gasps, spellbound, he's STUCK from behind.

The snake is so long, its body is draped on one side of the

greenhouse, but its head is on the other. With the power

of a dozer-shovel..JAWS like the open hood of a Cadillac...

TEETH the size of windows...CLAMP onto Aiken's mid-section,

instantly CRUSHING his ribs.

Chris finds a skein of ROPE. He throws the long end over a

ceiling beam, then instantly makes a LASSO out of the piece

in _is hand and tosses the loop at the snake's head .

Aiken's body, in the serpent's jaws, makes the rope miss.

Chris throws again. In the seconds between tosses, the snake

has SLURPED Aiken into its mouth. The rope encircles the

beast's head. Chris pulls. The noose slips down over the

snake's maxillaries and tightens around its neck. Chris uses

all his strength. With the ceiling beam as a pulley, the

snake's head is SLAMMED against the rafters.

Rebecca is, understandably, not quick to respond.

Pg-63

In this crisis, Chris finds himself sounding a lot like

Wesker. It sobers him. It sobers Rebecca, as well. She

rushes in and takes hold of the rope.

Moving fast, Chris rushes to where Aiken's knife dropped

on the floor. He grabs it, turns back, and sees...

...something MOVING inside the snake's beaded torso. It's

Aiken... still alive.

Chris charges, PLUNGES the knife into the beast, hacking

through layers of fat until he reaches a bloody CAVITY.

Aiken is curled within, like Jonah in the Whale. His chest

has been crushed to half its normal size. Acids from the

monster's intestine have begun to eat through flesh on his hands,

his face, but he's still conscious, able to wheeze-out words.

The snake uses all its strength to lower its head from the

ceiling. Rebecca hangs bravely onto the rope, but she's

LIFTED, bodily, off the floor.

The rope SNAPS, cut by the steel beam. Rebecca falls. The

trailing edge of the noose catches on twisted debris. It

delays the snake for two seconds.

Those fragile seconds give Chris just enough time to reach

into the open belly of the monster...and pull the PINS on

TWO GRENADES that dangle from Aiken's vest.

The giant copperhead SNAPS at Chris from behind, missing him

by inches. He dives, like a wide-receiver reaching for a

pass. What he catches is...

...Rebecca's arm. His momentum carries her down to the

floor. They roll behind another STONE WALL that contains

tons of earth, which protects them from...

...BOO-BOOOOOM!... the explosions of the grenades... which blow

Aiken... and yards of the snake's mid-section...into eternity.

INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS

The same nervous HANDS that we saw in the opening fidget on

the polished surface of the conference table. A distorted

VOICE scratches over a speaker-phone.

Pg-64

A hand with an ostentatious RING flicks cigar ash.

Holden's hand clicks off the speaker-phone.

INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS

WESKER, alone in the strange, faceted corridor, packs away

his radio. He hears... FOOTSTEPS. JILL appears.

Jill wonders. Should she challenge Wesker? She has no time

to think. More FOOTSTEPS come CLACKING at her back. It's

RODRIGUEZ and SPEYER. A moment later, BARRY and VICKERS

appear from the opposite direction.

Pg-65

TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG... a sound like a rivet gun resounds

in the corridor, repetitive, but random, not rhythmic.

INT   ELECTRIC TUNNEL   TIMELESS

CHRIS and REBECCA are crawling through a two-foot high

feeder-passage for electric cables, their bellies scraping

the floor, their backs the ceiling. They hear the sound...

...TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG! Then suddenly...it stops.

He looks back. Rebecca sniffles.

Rebecca nods, forcing a smile meant to be appreciative.

That sound returns... TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG...getting louder.

INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS

Down in the corridor, the other TROOPERS see...

...faintly in the dusty reaches of the dark... AGILE SHAPES

advancing... not along the floor, but along the CEILING!

They look like apes, swinging from... What could they be

swinging from? The ceiling is solid metal.

CLOSE ON: A MONSTROUS HAND, both hairy, and scaly. It's

fingers have ten-inch claws.. .more like horns... which PUNCH

upward, penetrating the ceiling metal, and clamping on.

Pg-66

THE SHOT WIDENS to reveal A BEAST, unlike any we've seen,

dangling from the ceiling. It is ape-like... and lizard-

like. With ferocious eyes that glare from beneath an insect-

like carapace. This thing is an amalgam of all the nasty

creatures that have pursued us in our nightmares. It's

called... A HUNTER.

There are SIX OF THEM... as far as we can see, there might be

more coming from behind. Their three-toed feet also have

claws that can pierce the ceiling, enabling them to move

forward... hand over foot, foot over hand.

One of them lets out a GRRROWLLLL! The same sound we've

been hearing through the walls. Now it echos in the

corridor, up close and personal. The troopers open fire,

even before the creatures get in range.

INT   ELECTRIC TUNNEL   TIMELESS

CHRIS and REBECCA hear the gunfire.

Chris crawls on. Rebecca is stopped when... TCHUNNNNGGG !

One of the HUNTERS' CLAWS PUNCHES up through the floor ,

almost stabbing her. Rebecca SCREAMS. In the tight space,

Chris is barely able to reach back and take her hand.

TCHUNNNNGG! TGG! More CLAWS penetrate the metal.

The couple plunge ahead of them, the way Chris plunged

ahead of the bullets on Level "A".

INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS

WESKER, JILL and the OTHERS spit lead at the advancing

creatures. Bullets THUNK into their bodies. Blood flows,

but the creatures seem to feel no pain. Even when they're

hit squarely in their skulls.

Pg-67

Jill aims at one of the hunters, pressing the trigger of

her M-16, and not letting go until her clip runs out.

The creature's head is turned RAGGED by the barrage...

revealing an iron SUPERSTRUCTURE beneath the skin.

Jill looks up. CHRIS jumps out of the open grate in the

ceiling. REBECCA jumps down after him.

Chris takes a careful SHOT with-his Winchester. He hits one

of the Hunters squarely on its WRIST...which SNAPS. The

creature drops to the floor.

Rebecca opens FIRE with Aiken's M-16, giving the others time

to reload. Barry is the first to resume firing...at the

closest of the Hunters... at its wrists, which are SNAPPED

by the bullets. The creature drops to the floor.

The troopers fire at KNEES, ANKLES, ELBOWS, which seem to

be the weakest spots. More of the hunters drop from the

ceiling...but they continue to advance, crawling, pushing

themselves forward with whatever limbs remain intact.

There are two hunters left on the ceiling. One of them makes

a mighty, impossible LUNGE... and hits Speyer like a battering

ram, slashing his CHEST OPEN with its claws.

Two of the hunters on the floor rush forward, not attacking,

but wanting to feed on Speyer's remains.

Pg-68

Brad, trembling, completely crazed, drops his weapon and

backs away. He sees...one of those jigsaw tiles, a RED

one, GLOW from within. He thinks he's hallucinating until...

...the floor JERKS, in a tight spasm. Its steel facets

begin to separate, sliding away from each other. The

troopers narrowly escape as.. .

...the floor behind them GRINDS, in and out, left and right,

as if it were CHEWING. Speyer's body, and those of the

hunters on the floor, are EATEN by the powerful steel blades.

But one hunter remains above it all. TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG,

it continues to advance along the ceiling.

An invisible, JIGSAWED DOOR glides open twenty yards down

the hall. The troopers run for it, and are met by a

beautiful Asian scientist... the woman we saw on the video

playback... ADA WONG.

TCHUNG TCHUNG... the Hunter approaches .

The troopers rush into...

INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS

...a security cubicle. CHRIS is the last to enter, barely

making it before the door begins to slide shut.

KA-TCHUNK! CLAWS penetrate the opening.

The Hunter GROWLS. Its snout darkens the space between door

and wall. Mucous from its nostrils spits through.

Pg-69

After a terrifying moment, the claw recedes. The dark

snout disappears. The snorting fades away. Followed by

a distant...TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG...as the hunter departs.

Everyone relaxes, visibly.

The troopers turn and, for the first time, notice two haggard

SCIENTISTS standing across the room.

Ada stares at a complicated control panel.

Jill looks at Chris. His point has been proven.

Ada looks at the detonator on Wesker's belt, at the sequence

of blinking lights.

70

Ada looks at him with disgust.

Pg-71

Pg-72

Ada is about to answer, but Wesker interrupts.

Ada glances at an innocuous wall panel. Wesker notices a

key-slot. Green.

Wesker steps over to the wall and inserts his green card into

the slot. The panel slides open. Beyond it is a steel door

with another green slot. Wesker uses his card again. A lock

CLICKS. Wesker pushes the door open.

Wesker taps his ear-piece. Everyone gets his meaning. He

and Barry disappear through the opening. The steel door

begins to close. Rodriguez lunges, and catches it.

Brad is leaning against a wall, sweating, shivering. Rebecca

looks at his wounded leg.

Pg-73

INT   STAIRWELL   TIMELESS

WESKER and BARRY trot down a flight of metal stairs.

Until now, Wesker has been steadfast. He suddenly seems

nervous, anxious. Some of it is fear. Most of it is

anticipation of the goal which is suddenly within reach.

INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS

CHRIS and JILL step past RODRIGUEZ. They take off down the

stairs.

As they leave, ADA opens a desk drawer and pulls out a .45.

Pg-74

Ada CLICKS back the bolt, whips up the .45, and aims it at

BRAD'S head. REBECCA dives in front of the man.

INT   SAFETY CHAMBER   "D" LAB   TIMELESS

WESKER and BARRY arrive at a set of PLEXIGLASS DOORS. They

can't see through them, they're FOGGED. Wesker finds a key

slot, inserts his access card, and...

...WHOOSH... the doors open. A CLOUD OF HYPER-COLD MIST

rushes out, instantly coating the men in FROST. Wesker

doesn't feel the cold. He doesn't feel anything, except

a surge of triumph. He steps through the opening into...

INT "D" LAB TIMELESS

...a laboratory that looks like-the cockpit of a Concorde...

only a hundred times larger.. Nothing is, recognizable, except

desks that hold futuristic-Ibokin computers. A befuddling

array of BUTTONS, SWITCHES, stuttering LIGHTS, covers every

inch of wall space.

And at the center of it all stands a tall, cylindrical TANK,

a stasis tube, filled with ICE. It's mounted on a six-foot

tall platform, like an altar, with cables and flexible tubes

running out of it. Wesker squints, and through the freeze,

sees the thing that stands sedated within the cylinder...

...THE TYRANT. It's nine feet tall. Like the hunters, it

has more or less human form, though it's musculature is more

defined than Superman's. One of its arms is scaled to size,

but the other is much longer. Its hand dangles at knee-

level. Monstrous steel CLAWS depend from its fingers,

nearly touching the floor.

Pg-75

Laying down his automatic, WESKER hits computer keys until

a DISK pops out of a master-feed.

Neither man notices... that the removal of the master disk has

caused certain systems to fail... indicated by red lights, and

by the fact that... the walls of the Tyrant's cylinder are

beginning to run liquid sweat. The ice... is MELTING.

JILL has appeared in the doorway with CHRIS. They both

at the monster with awe...and terror.

ROSIE has arrived. So have REBECCA, ADA, and the two

surviving SCIENTISTS.

Pg-76

Rosie steps into the lab, her weapon ready.

One of the scientists, TOSHIRO, rushes to join.

Jill looks at Chris. Then she steps through the doorway and

takes a defensive post beside her c.o.

Chris lifts his rifle. Wesker is faster with his pistol,

aiming it at Chris' belly.

Chris and Jill exchange dagger eyes.

Pg-77

Jill presses in close to Wesker, as if completely allied.

Swiftly, unexpectedly, Jill snatches the detonator wire and

pulls the sensor out of Wesker's ear.

Everyone shuts their eyes, expecting to be blown sky-high.

Nothing happens.

Jill pulls the detonator off Wesker's belt. She stares

small LED screen which reads... 14:42:16... 15... 14...

Jill tosses the detonator to Chris. Wesker turns on her,

lifting his M-16...

Wesker turns to find Barry's weapon aiming at his belly.

Wesker is holding the data-disk. Suddenly, he feels it

snatched away...by Ada, who has rushed into the room.

He aims his weapon at her back as she darts away. Before

he can fire, he's KICKED in the head... by Jill. Buckling,

dazed, he looks up at her.

She kicks him again, just for the hell of it. He flops on

the floor, his eye-socket swollen. He's dropped his gun.

He gropes for it. Barry steps in and boots it away.

A KLAXON SOUNDS! Emergency!

The ice in the Tyrant's tank has melted down to a critical

level. The monster... is beginning to MOVE.

Pg-78

Reaching the doorway, Ada hears a mechanism TRIP in the jamb.

The Plexiglas doors begin to slide shut. Ada strains to

hold them back.

Rosie rushes in to help Ada hold the doors. So does

BENJAMIN, the second of the surviving scientists, who is...

...MAULED from behind by a ZOMBIE. It's not just any zombie.

It's BRAD VICKERS, back from death, who BITES out the artery

in Benjamin's neck.

Ada lifts her .45 and blows Vickers way. She looks down

at Benjamin, writhing on the floor, aims at his head... and

FIRES again.

Rodriguez is the only one holding the doors. Jill rushes

to help her.

Inside the lab, Barry turns to Toshiro, the other scientist.

Toshiro hesitates... a second too long. KRAAASSSH! The

stasis tube BURSTS open. WATER and bits of ICE fly out...

along with an enormous, bionic HAND. Big-enough to grab

Toshiro's head as if it were a cantaloupe. Powerful enough

to CRUSH that head as if it were... well, a cantaloupe.

Wesker, still searching for his pistol, sees all this.

The Tyrant is not completely free. Much of the cylinder

wall has cracked away, but sections of it cling to a now

misshapen mass of ice that still holds the monster bound.

Though it won1t for much longer.

Wesker starts toward the door. Barry grabs the back of his

shirt and pitches him across the lab.

Pg-79

Barry turns to the others clustered at the doorway.

Wesker has found his pistol. He FIRES at Barry who, ducking,

is only GRAZED. Wesker aims at the group in the doorway.

Barry pops out from behind a desk and shoots back at him.

Ada and Rebecca duck away from the doors, pulling Rodriguez

and a reluctant Jill after them. The doors begin to slide

closed. Chris valiantly tries to prevent them from shutting.

Wesker CRAWLS lke a dog. He manages to fling an arm

out through the opening. Steel bumpers press on the meat

of his forearm. Wesker looks up. Through the Plexiglas,

his eyes meet Chris'.

With his free hand, Wesker aims his pistol at Chris. The gun

barrel is an intimidating sight, even though it's on the other

side of the plexi. Chris glances at the others.

Ada, Rebecca and Rodriguez wrestle Jill away bodily, and

start up the metal stairway.

Pg-80

Chris lets go. The doors squeeze tighter. Wesker SCREAMS.

Through the plexi, Chris catches a glimpse of Barry, who

stands and gives him a military salute. Chris salutes back.

BLAM BLAM BLAM... Wesker FIRES three rounds. Dusty blemishes

appear on the bulletproof glass. The slugs ricochet back

into the lab.

One of them CHIPS away at the ICE which is less and less

able to contain the Tyrant.

Chris makes a break for the stairs. Wesker twists his body

in an attempt to push his pistol through the opening, but his

fist, around the stock, is too thick. Nonetheless, Wesker

FIRES .BLAM BLAM BLAM... bullets SCREAM off the banister

rails, but none of them contact Chris' legs which disappear

up the stairs.

The ice in the stasis tube is turning to slush. The Tyrant

is about to break loose. Wesker looks pleadingly at Barry.

WESKER swings his free arm and aims his pistol at BARRY.

CLICK! The gun is empty.

INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS

The ESCAPEES arrive in the security cubicle.

Ada rushes over to the instrument panel. Her hands go to

work on an array of buttons and switches.

Pg-81

INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS

The multi-faceted CORRIDOR TWISTS into a new configuration

with the RUMBLE of an "eight" on the Richter.

INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS

Ada pulls a RED KEY from under her lab coat, snaps the chain

on her neck, and holds it out to Chris.

Chris grabs Ada's arm and holds it tight while he wrenches

the disk away from her.

He folds it over onto itself, drops it to the floor, and

pumps three Winchester rounds into it.

Pg-82

Ada looks deeply into Chris' eyes.

Jill takes a step toward Ada.

She and Chris touch eyes again, this time with understanding.

INT   "D" LAB   TIMELESS

THE TYRANT flexes its monumental muscles. The ice around

it CRACKS... but clings. The giant HEART dangling outside

its chest PUMPS rapidly...sending fluids through exposed

synthetic veins that run to the creature's brain.

Pg-83

Barry FIRES at the encased organ. His bullets bounce off the

shielding with no effect.

More ICE pops off the monster's pectorals.

INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS

CLOSE ON: ADA'S face.

She and the ESCAPEES are no longer in the Cubicle. They're

in the runway.

They break out, at the run, klacking along the faceted steel

floor of the movable... and still moving.. .corridor.

KRUNNNGGG! They're nearly knocked off their feet when the

system suddenly STOPS DEAD.

Ada slams her fist into one of those JIGSAW TILES on the

wall. Another RED one, which glows from within.

A PANEL grinds open, revealing...

Pg-84

INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   TIMELESS

...a more natural-looking corridor. Half-way along, there

are STEEL PRONGS that protrude from a wall. The group starts

toward them...but stops when a soul-shriveling SOUND fills

the passageway...the hungry MOANING of things that are dead.

INT   "D" LAB   TIMELESS

The TYRANT BREAKS free of the last bit of restricting ice.

WESKER FREAKS. Whimpering, he gropes with his hand that's

outside the Plexiglas doors. He grabs something. A BOOT.

Brad Vickers' boot. Wesker tugs on it.

BARRY opens fire on the Tyrant, full bore, with his M-16.

The stream of bullets does nothing except make the monster

notice the big man.

INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   TIMELESS

THE ESCAPEES run down the corridor. SHAPES appear at the

far end. ZOMBIES! Twenty. Thirty. Forty. More. The

walking remains of humans who were infected in the labs,

crawling over each other, hungry for living flesh.

The humans reach the FREIGHT LOADER. Prongs, like those on

a fork lift, extend from a heavy chain-drive that runs up

and down through openings in the floor and ceiling.

ADA swipes her red key through a slot and pushes a button.

The chain-drive Grinds upward, hoisting the prongs.

Ada pushes REBECCA onto the next set of prongs that come up

out of the floor. The footing is precarious. Rebecca has

to hold on to the chain as she is hoisted.

The lift moves slowly, eight feet separating each set of

prongs.

The ghouls continue to press in.

Pg-85

Rosie opens FIRE. Chris and Jill follow suit as Ada steps

onto the next set of prongs.

Blood FLIES. Skulls SHATTER. Front ranks drop. Zombies

from behind push their fallen comrades ahead of them. The

corridor is like a syringe filled with corrupted bodies,

pushing inexorably forward.

Rosie, teeth gritted, keeps firing while Chris forces Jill

onto the next set of prongs. As she rises, she hands her

M-16 to Chris. He slings it on his arm while levering his

old Winchester, making each of his shots count, until the

next set of prongs rises out of the floor.

Chris hands Jill's rifle to Rosie, who fires with both hands

as Chris jumps onto the lift.

Zombies are MOWED DOWN. But more come. The syringe keeps

pressing.

The next prongs rise. Rosie steps on, still blasting..

The first zombies reach her. Shooting down, she blows them

away. But more come, grabbing her legs, grabbing the chains,

ROCKING the prongs. Rosie nearly falls. She drops one of

the rifles in order to hold on. She carefully picks off the

most threatening zombies. Miraculously, she rises out of

their reach, and into...

INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS

...a very tight, very dark SPACE with sheet metal walls that

have been bruised by loads of freight. The rumble of the

chain-drive ECHOES frighteningly.

ABOVE ROSIE, THE OTHERS rise slowly... very slowly... feeling

apprehensive, vulnerable. REBECCA, at the top, looks up and

sees LIGHT spilling through an opening through which she is

about to pass.

Pg-86

Rebecca's eyes rise above the floor of Level "C". All seems

quiet... but who knows what might be lurking.

INT "D" LAB TIMELESS

THE TYRANT, still a bit sluggish, steps down from the

platform that supported its tank. BARRY jams in a fresh

clip and keeps firing at the thing. The Tyrant, impervious,

stalks after the big trooper.

Wesker is still on the floor, his arm through the doors,

tugging on Vickers' boot.

The flesh on Wesker's forearm is PEELED by the bumpers as

he uses all his strength to drag Vickers' body closer...

until the boot winds up in the opening, preventing the doors

from closing.

Wesker manages to pull his bloody arm free. He rushes to

a computer console and types a request for the "T"-virus.

Barry pulls a GRENADE from his belt.

Wesker's M-16 has been lying, where he left it, on the

console. He picks it up.

Barry is about to pull the pin on the grenade when Wesker

triggers off A BURST...into BARRY'S GUT!

Barry is BLASTED across the lab.

The Tyrant makes its first quick move... making us appreciate

how fast and powerful it really is. It swipes at Barry's

body as it flies through the air, catching it in it's steel

claw. We hears BONES SNAP as Barry goes limp.

Pg-87

The Tyrant lifts Barry's body, as if it were as light as a

feather, up to its snout. Recognizing that the man is dead,

the monster FLINGS him aside like so much garbage... and

begins to lumber toward Wesker.

A monitor reads: 90% COMPLETE...95%...98%. Wesker rests

a finger on the button to eject a floppy.

The Tyrant is getting closer by the second. Wesker FIRES

a burst at it which only slows it for a heartbeat.

100%.. .TRANSFER COMPLETED. Wesker ejects the floppy, jams

it into his flack-jacket, and, FIRING another burst, runs

for the door. The Tyrant has to move around desks and

computer consoles to catch him.

Wesker shoves his M-16 through the space that's being held

open by Vickers' boot. He begins to pry the opening wider.

A WARNING BUZZER goes off. The Tyrant dimly registers

the sound. Its eyes dilate, like camera shutters, with

a CLI-CLICK. It strides forward at top peed, PITCHING

DESKS easily aside, SMASHING through a CONSOLE as if it

were made of balsa.

Wesker has pried the doors wide. The Tyrant is coming at

him FAST. It's going to be very close.

Wesker MAKES IT. He gets outside. The doors begin to glide

shut. He LAUGHS!

THLANNG! The Tyrant's long, bionic CLAWS SHOOT, with the

speed of switch-blades, through the opening, just before the

doors meet. FOUR of the claws SKEWER WESKER, passing clean

through him.

He doesn't die instantly. He's still alive and SCREAMING

when the Tyrant uses the same hand, with Wesker impaled on

it, to PUSH the doors open wide again. The action causes

WESKER'S HEAD to be SLICED OFF by one of the steel bumpers.

The Tyrant steps out of the lab. As the doors glide shut,

the monster holds the remainder of Wesker's body inside

their path.

The bumpers are stopped by the Tyrant's iron hand... which

it extracts, letting the doors scrape the dead meat from

its claws.

Pg-88

INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS

REBECCA is approaching another OPENING.

INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS

THE CORRIDOR on Level "B" is long and narrow, with only

occasional pools of LIGHT from bare, overhanging bulbs.

REBECCA rises, like a spirit, out of the floor. She lifts

her weapon. Her eyes dart, looking for dangers. There are

none. The corridor, while very spooky, is quiet.

INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS

REBECCA rises through the ceiling.

As the ECHO of Ada's voice rings off, Rebecca looks up and...

...SCREEEE... SOMETHING dives down on her out of the darkness.

She ducks, almost losing her balance. She clings to the

chain as OTHER THINGS...black, relatively small.. .WHIP past

her head.

Rebecca dodges with new urgency as the black birds dive past

her. Looking up, she sees more coming. She aims her M-16

and fires up the shaft. TWO BIRDS are HIT. They plummet.

One hits ADA. She swats it aside. It drops all the way

down to ROSIE, who JUMPS, gasping, when it hits her.

Pg-89

Beneath her, Rosie sees the crows hovering in the light from

Level "B"... They circle, then start to fly up again.

Rosie opens fire, filling the shaft with ribbons of lead.

Another BIRD dives from above and... SKIT... takes a chunk

out of Rosie's cheek.

Rosie keeps FIRING. The deafening SOUND of her M-16 keeps

her from hearing a...

...KRATTCH...in the sheet-metal wall. A second later...

...RRRRRIPPP! The metal is torn open like tissue-paper.

SOMETHING dark lunges from the opening. It's the surviving

HUNTER! One of its steel claws GRABS the chain-drive. The

mechanism stops dead.

QUICK CUTS: of THE ESCAPEES slipping, nearly falling, as they

hang on to the chain.

Rebecca has nearly reached Level "A"... She's able to hoist

herself up, and roll to safety.

Ada tries to climb. The chain is GREASY. Her hands slip.

BELOW, the Hunter lets go of the mechanism. The chain JERKS.

The escapees nearly lose their balance again.

Rosie, at the bottom, is being lifted toward the Hunter's

free hand. She JUMPS down. Barely catching the next set

of prongs beneath her.

AT THE TOP, Ada reaches Level "A". Rebecca catches her and

pulls her up onto Level "A..

Jill is next, rising slowly. Rebecca and Ada reach down and

grab her arms just as... TCHUNG... the mechanism stops again.

The Hunter has grabbed the chain again. Its free hand

swings, clutching at Rosie, who crouches, avoiding capture.

Pg-90

Jill is pulled to safety. She turns and reaches down for

Chris, who starts to climb the chain, his hands slipping on

the grease.

She's not alright. She's trapped. She can't get up past

the Hunter. She FIRES at the thing. Bullets BOUNCE off its

protective steel under-hide.

Chris climbs three feet. Slides back two. The others reach

down from above. Their hands come within inches, but can't

quite catch hold of him.

Straining to reach Rosie, the hunter lets go of the chain

for a second, then latches on again. That second lifts

Chris to within reach of Jill and the others. They grab

his arms. Lift him up.

That second has also brought Rosie within reach of the

Hunter. Its claws COMB her hair as she tries to duck lower

while keeping her balance on the prongs.

THWAKK! SOMETHING crashes through the wall. A MONSTROUS

CLAW that IMPALES the Hunter. It's the claw of THE TYRANT!

The chain mechanism begins to rise again. Rosie, cringing,

is lifted past the monster just as it leans its head and

shoulders into the shaft to examine what it has caught.

Disappointed, the Tyrant SCRAPES the Hunter off its claw.

It drops away down the shaft.

The Tyrant turns its CLICKING, dilating eyes up at Rosie,

and...TCHUNNNGG...purposely STOPS the rising chain.

Pg-91

Rosie DIVES off the prongs...directly at the Tyrant. With

another lightning move, the monster catches her in its bionic

claw, crushing her ribs. With BLOOD spurting from her mouth,

she utters her last words...

INT   LEVEL "A"   TIMELESS

ADA is the most pragmatic.

Ada's words snap Chris back into the urgency of their

situation. He struggles to his feet.

They are in the MANSION, which Chris knows well. He leads

his small troop into...

INT   POWDER ROOM   TIMELESS

...a small powder room, decorated garishly in an East Indian

motif. A ceramic TIGER'S HEAD sits atop a vanity. CHRIS

grabs it...and TWISTS it on a pivot. A PANEL spins. The

COMMODE disappears into the wall, opening a SECRET PASSAGE.

Chris leads the other into...

INT   CLOCK ROOM   TIMELESS

...a small, blank CHAMBER. The only thing it holds is a

GRANDFATHER CLOCK .

Pg-92

CHRIS opens the door that covers the clock face. He quickly

spins the hands until they hit... HIGH NOON.

GRONNNK! A WALL begins to GRIND open, straining against

rust, dirt, from years of idleness. Cobwebs are pulled

apart and...DAYLIGHT APPEARS!

Chris urges the OTHERS out through the opening. At the same

time he checks the detonator. The LED is down to SIX MINUTES

and counting.

INT   HUEY   DAY

At the controls of his helicopter, LAGUARDIA spots something.

EXT   MANSION   HUEY'S POV   DAY

REBECCA, then ADA, then JILL climbing onto the lawn.

INT   HUEY   DAY

EXT   MANSION   YARD   DAY

...CHRIS climbs out of the secret exit. THE OTHERS, having

spotted the incoming chopper, are waving at it. There's a

sense of relief, of salvation. Only Chris notices...

...a bit of PLASTER falling away from one of the mansion's

stone walls.

KER-AAAASSSSHHH! THE TYRANT BURSTS through the wall. With

superhuman speed, it ATTACKS the escapees, who run, dodge,

barely escaping the WHISHING SWIPE of its iron claw.

Pg-93

INT   HUEY   DAY

EXT   MANSION   YARD   DAY

THE HUEY swoops down as low as safety will allow. A faceted

aluminum LADDER unfurls.

CHRIS pushes JILL toward the ladder. She pulls on Ada's arm

and sends her up first. ADA begins to climb. Then REBECCA.

The Tyrant closes in, SWIPING at Chris, who just manages to

avoid the SLICE of its mighty claw.

The RADIO MAN leans out of the door above, holding something.

Chris doesn't hear. Jill does.

The radio man drops the Stinger...a rocket with a shoulder-

launcher.. .down into Jill's hands.

Chris hits the dirt. The Tyrant tries to crush him by

stepping on him. Chris rolls away.

The ladder is too wobbly. Jill can't be sure of launching

an accurate shot.

Chris looks up. Sees Jill holding the rocket launcher. He

RUNS past the Tyrant, okey-doking, left, right, then dodging

left again. The monster SWIPES at him with its elongated

claw. Chris' flack-jacket is caught. Protective fibers fly.

But Chris escapes without injury.

Pg-94

Jill pitches the weapon. Chris catches it. The Tyrant is

on him, about to STOMP him with a bionic FOOT when...

...Chris aims at the monster's rhinoceros heart and FIRES!

The rocket CONNECTS, on target. The casing around the animal

heart EXPLODES... and the Tyrant drops like a giant Redwood...

...on top of Chris's legs.

As Chris tries to free himself, he checks the detonator.

THREE MINUTES. TWO-FIFTY-NINE. EIGHT. SEVEN. SIX.

LaGuardia drops his chopper a bit lower. The bottom of the

ladder hits the ground, coming within Chris' reach. He grabs

on. The helicopter rises again. Chris is pulled out from

under the Tyrant's steel body and is LIFTED into the air.

He climbs frantically.

Above him, Jill is still on the ladder as well. Ada and

Rebecca pull her up. Chris DANGLES as the Huey banks away

over the forest. The tops of TREES whip his legs, but he

hangs on, climbing up... up... until the others catch his

hands and hoist him into the chopper. Chris checks the LED.

ONE MINUTE, FORTY-FIVE SECONDS.

The Huey banks into a circle. Chris looks down at...

EXT   AERIAL POV   DAY

...the MANSION. And just over the hills...HIS FARM.

INT   HUEY   DAY

CHRIS looks at her, with a resigned smile.

Pg-95

Chris checks the LED. THIRTY-EIGHT SECONDS.

LaGuardia pushes his stick. The Huey LUNGES forward at

top speed. REBECCA, ADA and JILL are pressed back by

inertia. Chris holds himself erect. Through the window,

in the receding sky, he spots...

...AN EAGLE, riding the wind.

CUT TO:

EXT   THE ARKLEY FOREST   THE MANSION   DAY

PLOOOOMMMMM! The GROUND ERUPTS from an enormous under-

ground explosion. The MANSION is reduced to particulate

as the shock-wave spreads outward.

EXT   FARM   DAY

Chris' farm hand, RAKE, is shambling out of the house, a

ZOMBIE... when the EXPLOSIVE FORCE HITS, tearing him APART.

EXT   RACCOON CITY   DAY

The TOWN is EMPTY...except for NINE LONELY FIGURES, lumbering

down Main Street. They, too...are ZOMBIES. The hot wave

HITS. Two are VAPORIZED. FIRE engulfs two more. The BRAINS

of two others are DESTROYED by flying debris.. .

...which catches the remaining three, as well. Arms are

torn off. Iron shafts from shattered plumbing, shards of

window glass, slats from picket fences... PUNCH through

necks, chests, bellies...

...but the dead things, their skulls undamaged,

through billows of dust... drooling hungrily.

THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.
