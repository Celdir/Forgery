EXT.  MANHATTAN ISLAND - DAY

A high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the Statue of Liberty

prominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor, OVER the

Battery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DAY

A car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is

having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer.

DANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full

bags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The

building superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to

notice.

She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and

makes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy.

BABY BUGGY

It starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY

He GURGLES with delight at the movement.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DANA AND FRANK - DAY

Neither of them notice the movement of the carriage.

BUGGY WHEELS

The brakes unlock themselves.

DANA

She reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward

just out of her reach and stops.  Surprised by the movement, she reaches

for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even

further.  Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps

rolling down the street at ever increasing speed.

SIDEWALK

Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians

for help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy

swerves and continues unchecked.

INTERSECTION

Cars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races

toward the corner.

DANA

She puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY

A city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy.

BUGGY

It careens toward the corner.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY

Its eyes are wide open with excitement.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY

Bus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and

into the crosswalk.

BUS

The bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the

intersection at high speed.

BUGGY

It comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street.  The bus

continues missing the buggy by inches.

INTERSECTION

Cars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the

intersection and snatches up the baby.  She hugs it close, deeply

relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the

supernatural has re-entered her life.

EXT.  UPPER WEST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY STREET - GHOSTBUSTERS LOGO - DAY

THEME MUSIC kicks in strongly as we see the familiar "No Ghosts" symbol

and PULL BACK to reveal that it's painted on the side of Ecto-1, the

Ghostbusters' emergency vehicle, which is speeding up Broadway on the

Upper West Side.  RAY STANTZ is driving and WINSTON ZEDDEMORE is riding

shotgun.

EXT.  WEST 77TH STREET - DAY  (MOMENTS LATER)

The Ectomobile pulls up in front of a carefully-restored brownstone.

Stantz and Winston, wearing their official Ghostbuster uniforms, jump

out of the old ambulance, shoulder their proton packs and enter the

house.

INT.  BROWNSTONE - DAY  (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

A WOMAN greets them and leads them through the expensively-furnished

house.

She holds her hand out indicating about four feet.

She leads them to a set of French doors that open into another room.

Stantz and Winston pause to make final adjustments to their equipment.

He pushes through the French doors and they step into the room.

INT.  BROWNSTONE - DAY  (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

They are immediately attacked by fourteen or fifteen screaming KIDS

between the ages of seven and ten.

Tables are set with party favors, ice cream and birthday cake and the

room is strewn with discarded toys and games.  A couple of weary parents

sink onto lawn chairs as Stantz and Winston take over the party.

He kicks Stantz in the leg.  Stantz grabs him by the shirtfront.

Winston switches on a tiny TAPE RECORDER which starts PLAYING the

Ghostbusters THEME SONG. Stantz and WInston start singing

EXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)

Stantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile.

They get in the car

INT.  ECTO-1 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over.

He turns the key again, the ENGING TURNS OVER, then starts GRINDING and

CLUNKING disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits

of metal onto the pavement.  Finally, with a BLAST of black sooty

exhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies.  Frustrated, Stantz

bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel

INT.  WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER)

A bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR,

Channel 10 in New York. We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title

card and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and

we return to the show in progress: "World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter

Venkman."  There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and

sitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN, the renowned and somewhat

infamous ex-Ghostbuster.

VENKMAN

He turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone,

understated and intimate.

The CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE, an attractive, aggressive New Jersey

housewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman.

INT. TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER)

Venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, NORMAN, a

well-meaning young incompetent.

There is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come

out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants.

Venkman starts down the hall as the MAYOR and his principal aide, JACK

HARDEMEYER, come walking out of the studio.

The Mayor sees Venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know

him.

The plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand

against Venkman's chest.

Hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand.

Hardemeyer walks off with the two cops.

EXT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY

The broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and

visitors.  Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and

enters the museum.

INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATER)

We are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of VIGO

THE CARPATHIAN, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an

incredibly powerful evil presence.  Then we PULL BACK to reveal the

studio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit

by large skylights in the ceiling.  Working on the Vigo painting is

JANOSZ POHA, a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the

department, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy.  Janosz is staring

longingly across the room at Dana.

DANA

She is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting, still

preoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy.  Janosz

watches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her

shoulder.

Dana jumps, startled by the intrusion.

VIGO PAINTING

At the mention of Dana's baby, the figure of Vigo miraculously turns his

head and looks at Dana.

JANOSZ AND DANA

Neither of them notice the movement in the painting.

She starts gathering up her things.

Janosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel.

He switches on an English language TAPE and starts practicing the

phrases as he resumes working.

EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY

Dana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building.  A sign

identifies it as "The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research."

INT. UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER)

Dana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER, the soberly

intellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an

experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom

are Japanese, Chinese, or Korean.  The device he is testing is a black

box about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic

displays.

An ASSISTANT interrupts.

He picks up the device and prepares to test it.

An assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually

a two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room.  Inside the

waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated

arguement.

As Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the

waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay.  They explode

with anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them

through the glass.  After recording his readings, he returns to his

Assistant.

They move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely

little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys.

The Assistant interrupts again.

They watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable

Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl.  Spengler monitors

her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog.

She shakes his hand and exits.

EXT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOK STORE - DAY (LATER)

It's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in

Greenwich Village.  The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old

books full of arcane metaphysical lore.  The TELEPHONE RINGS.

INT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOKS - CONTINUOUS

The shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal.

Ray sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan

sweater over a T-shirt.  He has on a pair of reading glasses and chews

on a battered, reeking pipe.  As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup

of herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text.

He hangs up.

The bones hanging over the door rattle as Venkman enters the shop.

Spengler steps out of the stacks.

Venkman steps behind the counter and takes a beer from Ray's mini-fridge.

He hands Venkman the book.

He grabs Stantz by both ears and pulls up.

Venkman lets go of his ears and smiles.  Spengler looks at Stantz and

shakes his head.

INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - DAY (LATER)

The apartment is old and creatively furnished with a comfortable mix of

modern and traditional pieces.  Maria, a young Hispanic woman who does

day care for Dana, is feeding the baby in the kitchen when the DOORBELL

RINGS.

Dana enters from the bedroom and crosses to the front door.  She opens

it and admits Ray and Egon.

She shakes his hand and is about to close the door when Venkman appears

in the doorway.

Dana is caught completely off guard by Venkman's surprise appearance.

She regards him coolly, as always amused and amazed at his

presumptuousness.

Stantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on

the baby and the immediate physical environment.

VENKMAN AND DANA

Venkman starts nosing around the apartment.  Dana follows him.

He leaves her and crosses to Spengler.

SPENGLER

He's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby

with a tape measure and calipers.

Spengler ignores the remark and hands Venkman a specimen jar.

He starts clowning with the baby, holding him over his head and pressing

his nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking

him.

Dana is amused and somewhat disarmed by Venkman's rapport with the baby.

He looks at the baby, pulling his feet up, trying to get the sleeper

off.

INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - NURSERY - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman enters and finds Stantz monitoring the room.

Spengler enters.

EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)

Dana walks down the street with Venkman, retracing the path of the

runaway buggy.  Spengler and Stantz follow, monitoring PKE valences from

the pavement and the buildings.

Dana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street.

Venkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely

oblivious to the CARS HONKING and whizzing past him and starts motioning

like a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill.  Then he signals

for Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street.

Stantz reads the PKE meter.

Spengler switches on the Giga-meter, the device he was testing in the

lab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped.

The indicator goes right into the red zone and the DEVICE starts CLICKING

WILDLY.

Stantz and Spengler look at him skeptically, not convinced by the

coincidence theory.

INT.  MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - LATE AFTERNOON

The museum has just closed for the day and the last of the visitors and

employees are leaving.

INT.  RESTORATION STUDIO - SAME TIME

Janosz is working late on the painting of Vigo.

VIGO PAINTING

Unnoticed by Janosz, the eyes of Vigo start to glow.

JANOSZ

He touches his brush to the canvas and a powerful current of red,

crackling energy surges through the brush and courses through his body,

driving him to his knees.

PAINTING

The figure of Vigo comes to life, turns toward Janosz and gestures

dramatically at him.  Then he speaks to Janosz in a commanding voice.

Bolts of red-hot energy shoot from the eyes of Vigo into Janosz's eyes.

He screams and falls to his knees.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT

Venkman and Stantz come out with small boxes containing coffee,

sandwiches and Danish and start walking up the street.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Spengler, wearing a hardhat, is JACKHAMMERING a hole in the middle of the

street.  Safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is

lit by strong work lights.

POLICE CAR

It turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift

worksite and stops.  The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler

doesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them.

Finally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes.

Venkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a

good imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman.

The cops seem satisfied by the explanation.

They drive off.  Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts

rubbing his sore shoulders.

Stantz resumes JACKHAMMERING, while Venkman and Spengler clear the

rubble from the hole.  Suddenly he hits metal.  They clear away

generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover.

The manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters NYPRR.

They prey off the iron cover with crowbars, uncovering a very dark and

very deep abyss.

Spengler leans in with the giga-meter which is reading even higher now.

Venkman and Spengler both look at Ray.

They snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong

cable attached to a winch.  Ray calls out orders to them as he descends

deeper and deeper.

INT.  HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz rappels off the sides of the airshaft as he continues his descent

in total darkness.

Suddenly, his feet kick thin air as he gets to the bottom of the airshaft

and swings free in some kind of tunnel.

He pulls a powerful flashlight from his utility belt and shines it into

the tunnel below.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - NIGHT

He is suspended near the top of a beautifully preserved chamber with

rounded, polished tile walls ardorned with intricate, colorfully enameled

Art Nouveau mosaics.  A finely inlaid sign identifies it as VAN HORNE

STATION.

STANTZ

He pans the walls with his flashlight, admiring the excellent tilework,

and speaks quietly to Venkman and Spengler over his walkie-talkie.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman has no idea what he's talking about.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the extremely

high reading.

As Venkman and Spengler feed him some more cable, he pans his flashlight

down the wall of the station, then onto the floor.

INT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - FLOOR - NIGHT

Below him is a river of bubbling seething, glowing slime, a veritable

torrent of disgusting ooze.

As he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely

amplified and magnified sounds of great ENGINES THROBBING and pulsing in

the bowels of the city, of WATER RUSHING through pipes, STEAM HISSING

through ducts, the muffled RUMBLE of the SUBWAY and the ROAR of TRAFFIC,

and mixed with it all, the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain

-- VOICES SHOUTING in anger, SCREAMING in fear, GROANING in pain, a sad

and eerie symphony.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ - NIGHT

STANTZ

He dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he

can.  He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on

it, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end.

Reaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting

the pole.

SLIME

Suddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of

the slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet.  He jerks his legs up

as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's

car drives up, and behind it, the same police car they saw earlier.  A

burly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two

cops.

Venkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the

belligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex

hardhat.

Venkman pops Spengler on the head.

Stantz can be heard ranting over Venkman's walkie-talkie.

Venkman switches off the walkie-talkie.

Venkman stares at the Cop for a long moment.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - SAME TIME

Stantz is hanging there, looking down into the shaft at the slime which

is now bubbling up the shaft after him.

Desperate now, he kicks wildly and knocks loose a section of an old,

rusting conduit.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT

The conduit falls on a heavy electrical transmission line, ripping

through the cable with a SHOWER OF SPARKS.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Venkman, Spengler, the cops and the supervisor all react to a bright

FLASH deep down in the hole and a SHOUT from Stantz.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - STREET - NIGHT

One by one, all the streetlights go out; then the lights on all the

buildings along East 77th street; then the whole neighborhood blacks

out, and finally the entire city is plunged into darkness.

INT. DANA BARRETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

She walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all over

the living room.  Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for

information about the blackout.  She listens to a special news report

for a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby.

She crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door

and looks in.  Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death.

Leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz

standing in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of

the hallway.  He looks slightly dazed and even creepier.

His affected concern is chilling.  She is frightened but conceals it

from him.

He tires to look around her into the apartment.

She closes the door behind him and double locks it, then stands there

staring into the candlelight, alone and afraid.

INT.  HALLWAY OF DANA'S BUILDING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Janosz stands there in semi-darkness, then his eyes light up like

headlights and he walks off down the hall.

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - NEXT DAY

The JUDGE, a rather sour-looking jurist of the old school, calls the

court to order.

DEFENSE TABLE

Stantz leans over and whispers to Spengler.

Stantz and Spengler are seated with their attorney LOUIS TULLY, lawyer,

CPA and former demonic possession victim.  Louis is desperately paging

through a mountain of legal textbooks.

SPECTATORS' GALLERY

Venkman is talking to Dana at the wooden rail in front of the gallery.

She gives him a quick, unexpected kiss and exits.  Venkman savors it for

a moment then goes back to the defense table.

PROSECUTION TABLE

Jack Hardemeyer, the mayor's principal aide, is goading the PROSECUTOR,

a very sober, humorless woman in her late thirties.

He smiles conspiratorially and makes a point of passing the defense table

on his way out of the courtroom.

DEFENSE TABLE

The Ghostbusters look up as Hardemeyer approaches.

Herdemeyer exits.  Louis looks devastated.

Spengler hands him a waste basket as the Prosecutor calls her first

witness.

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - DAY (LATER)

The Con Ed Supervisor is testifying.

EXHIBIT TABLE

Lying on the table are the basic tools of the Ghostbusting trade: three

proton packs and particle throwers, a couple of ghost traps, and various

meters and detection devices.

WITNESS STAND

She continues.

PROSECUTOR

She goes to the exhibit table and picks up a specimen jar containing the

slime sample Stantz removed from the tunnel.

DEFENSE TABLE

Venkman and Spengler look at Stantz.

Louis moans and goes back to his notes.

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - LATER

Venkman himself is on the stand and Louis is questioning him.

The Prosecutor rises and approaches the witness stand with relish.

The gallery laughs and the Judge gavels for order.

The spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order.

INT.  COURTROOM - LATER

The trial is nearing its end.  The Judge calls on Louis to make his

summation.

Louis rises.

Louis crosses to the judge's bench.

He goes back to the defense table and sits down.  Stantz and Spengler

hang their heads.  Venkman pats Louis on the back.

JUDGE

He stares at Louis, astonished at his summation.

He searches through a disorderly pile of notes.

STANTZ

He sees the activity in the jar

THE BENCH

The Judge continues

He hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily.  Then

he feels a LOW RUMBLING TREMOR in the courtroom.

SPECIMEN JAR

The slime starts to pulse and swell, pushing up the lid on the jar.

DEFENSE TABLE

Stantz anticipates big trouble.

The Ghostbusters duck under the defense table.

LOUIS

He stands up and looks around fearfully.

INT.  COURTROOM - GHOST BATTLE - DAY

Everybody is silent now as the rumbling increases.  All eyes turn to the

exhibit table.  Then suddenly all Hell breaks loose as TWO FULL-TORSO

APPARITIONS explode out of the specimen jar.

JUDGE

He looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and

recognizes them immediately.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

Big in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem ten

feet tall.  They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are

metal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still

attached.  Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their

bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to

get at the Judge.

JUDGE

Holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense

table where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the

spectral intruders.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense

table and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING.

PROSECUTOR

She sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge

with them.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They start punching through the jury box.

JUDGE

He is just about hysterical with fear.

With that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash

across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were

being displayed as evidence.  They strap them on hastily as the Brothers

continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge.

They flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle

throwers.

They switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts

them.

The towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot

lightning at their new adversaries.

They all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible

powerful STREAMS OF ENERGY, doing even more damage to the courtroom.

Working as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the

streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on

the floor.

They circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while

ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers.  Finally, Ray

sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of

light energy.

He stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the

traps which snap shut.

INT.  COURTROOM - TRAPS - DAY

LEDs on the outer casing start flashing, indicating the presence of a

ghost inside each trap.

INT.  COURTROOM - JUDGE - DAY (AFTER GHOST BATTLE)

He sticks his head up slowly from behind the debris of his bench and

looks around in total amazement.

LOUIS

He crawls out from under a chair.  Reporters and spectators get back on

their feet and start buzzing about the incredible manifestation.

PROSECUTOR

She's lying on the floor, attended to by the Bailiff and the Court Clerk.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They break into big smiles as photographers start snapping pictures of

them standing in the wrecked courtroom.

The spectators cheer and applaud.

EXT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY

The old, dilapidated Ghostbusters logo comes crashing to the ground,

dropped by a pair of workmen on a ladder, and the new logo is hoisted

into place over the main entrance.  It's just like the original "No

Ghosts" logo, but in the new one the ghost in the red circle is holding

up two fingers.  Venkman enters the firehouse.

INT.  BEDROOM SET (TV COMMERCIAL - FULL SCREEN VIDEO) - NIGHT

A man and his wife are lying in bed reading.  The man is played by Louis

Tully and JANINE MELNITZ, the Ghostbusters' once and future receptionist,

is playing his wife.  They are both terrible actors.  Suddenly, a ghost,

actually a very bad puppet on a wire, floats through the bedroom.  Janine

sees it and screams.

He picks up the phone.

As he starts to dial, the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the Ghostbusters

standing in the bedroom.  Their acting isn't much better than Louis and

Janine's.

GHOSTBUSTERS

Stantz speaks directly TO the CAMERA.

During his speech, Winston can be seen in the b.g. pretending to trap the

fake ghost.

Spengler actually mouths everyone else's dialogue along with them,

waiting for his cue.

He holds up a mug and a limp, uninflated balloon.

As Stantz wraps it up, SUPERS APPEAR at the bottom of the SCREEN: FULLY

BONDED - FULLY LICENSED - SE HABLA ESPANOL.

INT.  JACK HARDEMEYER'S OFFICE - DAY

Hardemeyer is watching the Ghostbusters commercial on a TV in his office.

He bangs his fist on his desk and angrily switches OFF the TV.

EXT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY (LATER)

The garage door opens and the new improved ECTOMOBILE comes ROARING out

onto the street, its ghostly SIREN MOANING and WAILING.  Louis comes

running out after it.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY

Louis comes back into the garage bay and stops as he smells a foul odor.

He sniffs around, following the smell.

He freezes.

INT. OFFICE AREA - LOUIS'S POV

Slimer, a spud-like green ghost, is hovering over Louis's desk, scarfing

down Louis's bag lunch.  Slimer looks up and sees Louis.

SLIMER AND LOUIS

They both scream and run off in opposite directions.

SLIMER

He passes right through a wall and disappears.

LOUIS

He runs right into a wall, recovers and exits in a hurry.

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY (LATER)

Runners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog

along the track that circles the reservoir.  One of the runners looks

behind him at the sound of APPROACHING FOOTFALLS and screams.

GHOSTLY JOGGER

A ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace.  Other runners

stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them.  Seemingly

oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to

his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse.

EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - DAY (SAME TIME)

Venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the

newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup.

STANTZ

He's sitting on a bench opposite Venkman's, casually watching the jogging

track.

GHOST JOGGER

He approaches the benches where the Ghostbusters are waiting.  As the

ghost jogger passes the benches, Stantz and Venkman simultaneously hit

concealed control buttons.  A ghost trap buried in the track throws up a

glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid-stride.

Stantz and Venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger.

EXT.  JEWELRY STORE - DAY

The Ghostbusters come out carrying smoking traps, wearing cheap

dime-store Santa Claus hats.

EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE - ORREFORS GLASS STORE - DAY

The Ectomobile is parked at the curb and a curious crowd looks on as the

Ghostbusters enter the store.

INT.  ORREFORS GLASS STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

All the precious crystal is floating in the air, several feet above the

glass shelves and display tables.  Stantz and Venkman are talking to the

manager while Winston and Spengler set up an array of electronic devices

positioned in each corner of the store.

On a signal from Stantz, Spengler and Winston switch on the devices which

throw laser-type beams around the perimeter of the store.  The manager

watches in horror as all the GLASSWARE suddenly drops out of the air,

SMASHES through the GLASS SHELVES and SHATTERS on the display tables.

There is a long pregnant pause.

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

Everyone else has gone home.  Dana is cleaning her brushes and putting

her supplies away.

VIGO PAINTING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vigo turns his head and watches Dana as she walks past the painting.

DANA

She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the

painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana

turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily

leaves the studio.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY

Louis is lurking behind a pillar, peeking out at the office area.  We PAN

DOWN TO the floor and see a foot pedal, then PAN ALONG the cord TO a

ghost trap sitting on Louis's desk.  Hanging from strings over the desk

are several pieces of Kentucky fried chicken.

WALL

Slimer partially emerges and furtively sniffs the air, then spots the

chicken bait.  He licks his lips, materializes completely and flies to

the chicken.

LOUIS

His eyes light up and he stomps the foot pedal.

DESK

The trap pops open and shoots out a powerful cone of energy.  Slimer

dodges it and escapes as a big section of the ceiling comes crashing down

on Louis's desk.

He slinks off, defeated.

INT.  MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - SECURITY DESK - DAY

The Ghostbusters commercial is playing on a portable TV on the security

desk.  Rudy, the Security Guard, is reading a National Enquirer with a

giant front-page headline: GHOSTBUSTERS SAVE JUDGE.  Venkman enters.

He exits.

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Dana is working on a valuable Flemish still-life by Ver Meer.  Janosz is

at the other end of the room, still working on the painting of Vigo.

Venkman enters and sneaks up behind Dana.

VIGO

He turns his head and watches Venkman and Dana.

VENKMAN

Unaware that he's being watched, Venkman squints at the still life,

holding up his thumb like he's seen artists do.

He starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio.

They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Janosz.

Venkman warily shakes his hand, trying to size him up.

Janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go.  Venkman and Dana cross to

the Vigo painting.  Janosz steps protectively in front of it.

Venkman reaches toward the painting, but Janosz grabs his hand.

Dana looks disapprovingly at Venkman.

Venkman and Dana cross back to her workspace.

He exits.

VIGO

Vigo turns his head and follows Dana as she returns to her workbench.

DANA

She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the

painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana

turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily

leaves the studio.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - LIVING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

Venkman and Winston enter and find Stantz and Spengler at work in the lab

area.

Stantz goes to the refrigerator, opens the freezer, rummages around among

the TV dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a

Tupperware container.

He pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute.

He takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a

large Petri dish.

He leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it.

SPECIMEN

It bubbles and swells, changing color with each insult.

STANTZ

He continues venting his rage on the slime.

The specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the

Petri dish.

STANTZ AND SPENGLER

They turn to Venkman for his reaction.  He's dumbfounded.

Spengler reacts as if he might be.

Spengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing "Cumbaya" to

the slime specimen.

SPECIMEN

It stops bubbling and starts to shrink.

Venkman and Winston watch intently as Spengler spoons some of the

psych-reactive slime onto an old toaster.

Stantz turns on a CASSETTE PLAYER and Jackie Wilson's "HIGHER AND HIGHER"

BLASTS from the speakers.

TOASTER

It shakes, spins and actually starts moving in time with the MUSIC.

VENKMAN

He stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of

toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat.

Stantz turns OFF the MUSIC and the toaster stops moving.  Venkman looks

at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot.

Suddenly, he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand

and won't let go.  The others jump in to help him, but Venkman laughs and

easily withdraws his hand.

INT.  DANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet.  She's

wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby.  She

turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub, checks the water

temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby.

BATHTUB

The water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the

bottom of the tub.  Dana reaches over and turns off the water without

looking into the tub.  When she turns away, both taps start to spin by

themselves and the tub flexes and bulges.

DANA

Still unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath

into the tub.

BATHTUB

The rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the

bubble bath.

DANA

She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub.

She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to

close up around the baby like a hugh mouth.  Dana screams, snatches the

baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the

bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - SAME NIGHT (LATER)

The big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old

magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment.  Venkman is asleep on the

floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed

just short of the bedroom.  The DOORBELL RINGS, he wakes up, lumbers to

his feet and answers it.  He opens the door and sees Dana standing there.

She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked,

wrapped in a baby blanket.

Venkman looks at her for a long moment.

He exits to the bathroom.  She looks around the loft, amazed at the

disorder.  Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and

takes Oscar from her.

He spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts

tying it around him like a diaper.

He hangs up.

It's an incredible mess. The sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the

counters are littered with all sorts of food trash.  He grabs a big open

Hefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it.

He opens a drawer full of pizza, barbecue and Chinese food menus, then

crosses to the bathroom.

He goes into the bathroom and we hear WATER RUNNING, the TOILET FLUSHING

and more items going into the Hefty bag.

He comes out of the bathroom with the now-loaded Hefty bag over his

shoulder.

Venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living

room, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer.

EXT.  MUSEUM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

Venkman is waiting in front of the building as ECTO-2 pulls up and

Stantz, Spengler and Winston get out and report on Dana's apartment.

They enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment.

INT.  MUSEUM - SECURITY DESK - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Rudy the guard looks up in surprise as the Ghostbusters enter.

Rudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the Ghostbusters

head upstairs.

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Janosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter.  He

rushes over and stops them at the door.

They deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices.

STANTZ

Using the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to

the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio.  Venkman

comes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels.

They watch the painting for any sign of movement.

VIGO

His eyes stare lifelessly into the distance.

STANTZ AND VENKMAN

Venkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo.

Venkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting.  Stantz scans

the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's.

VIGO

His eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul.

STANTZ

He stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle

transformation occurs within him.  Winston comes up behind him and breaks

the spell.

They head for the door.

JANOSZ

He escorts the Ghostbusters to the door.

They exit.

EXT.  MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)

The Ghostbusters cross to ECTO-2.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (LATER)

The Ghostbusters are driving back to the firehouse.  Stantz is at the

wheel.  His eyes are vacant, he seems distracted and very tense.  Stantz

swerves suddenly and HONKS the horn angrily.

Venkman and Winston exchange surprised looks.

EXT.  STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz drives extremely fast, HONKING vindictively, weaving dangerously

through traffic.

Ecto-2 is now barreling down the avenue.  Pedestrians leap to safety as

Stantz runs a red light.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz looks at him and smile demonically.

He swerves off the road.

The car heads right for a big tree.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

At the last possible moment, Winston cold-cocks Stantz, grabs the wheel

and steps across to stomp on the brakes.

EXT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The car skids into the tree and stops.  The Ghostbusters stumble out

dazed and shaken, but unhurt.  Stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the

others, completely at a loss.

They inspect the damage to the car.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - DAY (LATER)

There's a KNOCK at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and Venkman

enters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small

suitcase of Dana's.

He looks around the large open loft.

He hears the SHOWER RUNNING and crosses to the bathroom.  The door is

half-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through

the transparent vinyl curtain.  He closes the bathroom door and looks at

the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling

off.  Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the

bathroom wrapped in a towel.  She jumps back into the bathroom.

She comes out again, this time wearing a robe.

She squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door.

Dana opens the bedroom door.

She smiles and closes the door again.  He opens the closet and starts

looking for his good suit.

He pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - RECEPTION AREA - EARLY EVENING

Janine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights.

Then she notices that the lights are still on upstairs.  She starts

primping and freshening up her makeup.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - LAB AREA - SAME TIME

Louis is strapping on a proton pack, preparing to deal with Slimer once

and for all.  He's wearing a bicyclist's rearview mirror on a headband.

THE CEILING

Slimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging

upside down.

LOUIS

He spots Slimer through the rearview mirror.

He whirls around and fires a proton stream at Slimer, slicing a burning a

gash across the ceiling.

THE STAIRS

Janine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and

strikes the wall behind her.  Slimer disappears.

Louis quickly slips off the proton pack and sets it down.

There is an awkward silence between them and Janine starts to leave.

They exit.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (LATER)

There is a KNOCK at the door and Venkman goes to answer it.  He's dressed

for the evening and looking very dapper.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Venkman opens the door and finds Stantz, Spengler and Winston standing

there wearing over-the-hip rubberized waders, firemen's slickers, and

miners' helmets, carrying tons of sensing devices, meters, collection

jars and photographic equipment.  They look like they're rigged out for a

major spelunking expedition.

Dana steps into the living room looking very beautiful.

Dana looks curiously at their outfits.

They nod and wave back.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (LATER)

Stantz, Spengler and Winston come down the stairs into the station,

guided by a very old map of the underground city.

They cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of slime.

Stantz has a long, coiled, graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of

it attached to his utility belt.

He takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and

casts it out into the middle of the flow.  The plumb bob sinks and

Spengler reads the depth.

Stantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the

platform and around his boots.

He starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck.

Spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger

than all three of them.  As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and

closer to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his

belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt.  Spengler lets go in time

but Winston doesn't.  He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow.

Stantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in

after him.

INT.  ARMAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER)

Dana and Venkman are sitting at a table in an elegant restaurant nibbling

caviar and toasting with very expensive champagne.

Janine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby.

Louis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down.

He sits stiffly beside her on the sofa.

EXT.  STREET - MANHOLE COVER - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

A manhole cover is dislodged and pushed up from below.  It slides away,

and Winston crawls out of the manhole followed by Stantz and Spengler.

They are exhausted and covered with slime.

Spengler steps between them with unprecedented aggression.

They grab each other and start to tussle.  Suddenly Spengler comes to his

senses and pulls them apart.

He starts yanking off his slicker and waders.  Bewildered, Stantz and

Winston start doing the same.  Spengler helps pull off their clothes and

throws them into the open manhole.  Now wearing only long underwear, they

seem to return to normal.

Stantz looks around and sees that they are standing right in front of the

museum.

INT.  ARMAND RESTAURANT ENTRANCE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The MAITRE D' looks up in surprise as Stantz, Spengler and Winston enter

the restaurant wearing only long underwear.

Stantz looks around and spots Venkman.

They blow right by the Maitre d' who jumps back in horror as they pass.

VENKMAN

He's just about to pour more champagne when he sees Ray, Egon and Winston

coming toward him through the restaurant.

He gestures excitedly and a big gob of slime flies across the room and

lands on a well-dressed diner.

Venkman notes the look of alarm on Dana's face and pulls his colleagues

aside.

MAITRE D'

He hurries through the restaurant with two city COPS right behind him and

makes straight for Venkman's table.

Stantz suddenly realizes how ridiculous they look.

He takes Stantz by the arm but Stantz resists.

The Cop catches Venkman in an armlock and starts walking him out of the

restaurant.

They all exit, causing a major commotion among the other diners.

EXT.  ARMAND'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The police car is parked right behind Ecto-2.  Spengler stops at the

police car and confronts the cops.

City.

INT.  GRACIE MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

The Ghostbusters, now wearing police raincoats over their longjohns are

ushered through the house by a butler to a set of double oak doors.  The

butler knocks lightly, then opens the door to reveal the MAYOR sitting in

front of the fireplace in his well-appointed private study, flanked by

Jack Hardemeyer, both in tuxedoes.  The Ghostbusters enter.

INT.  STUDY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The Mayor is impatient and a little angry at having been pulled out of

his formal reception.  He frowns at their bizarre attire.

The mayor exits, leaving the Ghostbusters to Hardemeyer.

Hardemeyer's eyes go cold and calculating.

INT.  PARKVIEW HOSPITAL - PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT (LATER)

An attendant opens a locked door with a wire mesh window and the

Ghostbusters, in straitjackets, are led into the psych ward as Hardemeyer

confers with the chief PSYCHIATRIST.

He laughs off the remark.

Hardemeyer shakes his hand and exits as the door slams shut on the

Ghostbusters.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Louis and Janine are watching an old rerun on TV, eating popcorn, while

She hears a little CRY from the nursery and sits up.

She crosses to the bedroom.

INT.  VENKMAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Dana enters and immediately notices that the crib is empty and the window

is open.

Frantic now, Dana rushes to the window and looks out, as Louis and Janine

come running in.

EXT.  WINDOW LEDGE - DANA'S POV - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)

The baby is standing out on the ledge at the corner of the building,

fifty feet above the street, staring off into the distance as if he's

waiting for something.

EXT.  WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT (ECLIPSE) (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Dana climbs out onto the ledge and starts inching slowly toward the baby.

Then she stops as a miraculous apparition materializes.

LOUIS AND JANINE

They lean out the window, gaping at the apparition.

EXT.  VENKMAN'S LEDGE - APPARITION

A sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling

on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground.  Her face looks

remarkably like Janosz Poha's.  The nanny extends her hand to the BABY

who GURGLES sweetly as he reaches out to take it.

DANA

She watches in helpless horror.

GHOST NANNY

She picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and

smiles at Dana.  The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny

shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby.

DANA

She watches the creature fly off with Oscar, then climbs back through

the window assisted by Louis and Janine.

EXT.  MUSEUM - NIGHT (A LITTLE LATER)

A taxi pulls up, Dana jumps out and rushes into the museum.  The moment

the door closes behind her, there is a loud THUNDERCLAP, the ground

trembles and a massive amount of slime erupts from around the base of

the museum and starts covering the walls, sealing her inside the

building.

INT.  PARKVIEW PSYCHIATRIC - PADDED ROOM - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston are in a padded cell.  They are

handcuffed and the cuffs are chained to thick leather belts around their

waists.  Venkman stands there banging his head into the padded wall

while the others try to explain the situation to a skeptical

Psychiatrist.

The psychiatrist looks at Venkman.

INT.  MUSEUM RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Moonlight streams through the skylight above, bathing the studio in

eerie white light.  Oscar is lying safely on a table in front of the

painting of Vigo.  Dana enters cautiously and sees the baby.  Seeing no

one else about, she quickly sneaks down to the table and picks up the

baby, hugging hin tight, greatly relieved to find him unharmed and

intact.

Startled, Dana turns at the sound of his voice as Janosz steps out from

behind the Vigo painting.

Dana walks quickly to the door but suddenly Oscar flies out of her arms,

floats across the room and lands lightly back in the cradle.

DANA

She turns and looks at Vigo, for the first time feeling his power.

EXT.  PARKVIEW HOSPITAL - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

It's the last day of the year and the sun is shining brightly.

INT.  PARKVIEW PSYCHIATRIC WARD - DAY (SAME TIME)

The Ghostbusters are sitting in the dayroom, a dingy lounge for patients

in the locked ward.  There is a television set, a Ping-Pong table and a

few tables and chairs.  Stantz is looking at the sky through the heavy

wire mesh covering the windows.

Venkman is doing occupational therapy, weaving on a little hand-loom.

A PATIENT at the next table joins the discussion.

INT.  PARKVIEW HOSPITAL - EXAMINING ROOM - DAY (SAME TIME)

A drainpipe starts dripping slime into the river near the Cunard Line

docks.

EXT.  PUBLIC FOUNTAIN (59TH AND FIFTH) - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)

With the Plaza Hotel in the background, the fountain starts to spout

psycho-reactive slime.

HOTEL ENTRANCE

A well-heeled MAN and WOMAN step out of a limousine and walk up the steps

toward the revolving door.  She looks up at the sky and frowns.

She doesn't notice it, but a small amount of slime falls on the back of

her luxurious, full-length, white mink coat.  The doorman nods

courteously and extends a hand to help her up the stairs.

WOMAN

She yelps in pain.

The doorman looks curiously at her, then recoils in shock as her coat

comes alive.  MINK HEADS pop out of the thick fur, SNARLING, BARKING and

YAPPING, their sharp, little teeth biting the air.  Reacting quickly, the

doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and

starts stomping on it as the Woman and her husband look on in horror.

The coat scuttles down the steps and runs off down the street.

INT.  MIDTOWN CENTRAL POLICE PRECINCT - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)

The squad room is busy as DETECTIVES try to answer the flood of calls

The dock supervisor stands there with the phone in his hand, an assistant

beside him, both staring out the window at the ocean liner tied up at the

pier.

EXT.  PIER 34 - THEIR POV - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)

The name "R.M.S. Titanic" is clearly visible on the side of the huge

ship.  The gangplank is down and dozens of drowned passengers, sopping

wet and festooned with seaweed, are disembarking while drowned porters

off-load their waterlogged baggage.

EXT.  PARKVIEW HOSPITAL - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)(ECLIPSE)

Ecto-2 is parked outside as Louis and Sherman come out of the hospital

with the Ghostbusters, now wearing their standard uniforms.

ECTO-2 pulls to the curb across the street from the museum.  Hundreds of

spectators are already there gawking at the building as the Ghostbusters

jump out and gape at the sight that greets them.

EXT.  MUSEUM THEIR POV - BUILDING

The building is now totally covered in a shell of psycho-reactive slime.

CITY WORKMEN and FIREMEN are trying to cut their way in with blowtorches,

jackhammers, power tools and the "jaws of life," but they can't even make

a dent.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They size up the situation as they don their proton packs.

They stride manfully across the street and approach the main entrance to

the museum.

The workmen and firemen put down their tools and fall back as the

Ghostbusters draw their particle throwers.

They adjust their settings and prepare to fire.

They trigger their throwers and spray the front doors of the building

with bolts of proton energy, but it has no effect on the hardened slime.

A few of the firemen and workmen tentatively raise their hands.  Venkman

grabs them and lines them up at the entrance of the museum.

Stantz, Spengler, Winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding

hands and swaying to the music.

Stantz inspects the wall of slime with his infra-goggles and finds that

they have only managed to open a hole the size of a dime.

His eyes fall on ECTO-2's New York State license plate which features a

line drawing of the Statue of Liberty.

EXT.  THE STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

There is a commotion among the crowd as the Mayor's limousine arrives

with a police escort.  Jack Hardemeyer steps out followed by the Mayor

himself and they cross to the museum entrance.

Hardemeyer, his ASSISTANT and several police BODYGUARDS confront the

Ghostbusters.

The Mayor stops to consider the situation.

The Mayor turns to Venkman.

Hardemeyer flips out.

He pounds the wall of slime with his fist, and they all watch in

amazement as his fist goes through the wall and he is sucked bodily

through the slime curtain.  Only his shoes can be seen, embedded in the

slime.

EXT.  LIBERTY ISLAND (NEW YORK HARBOR) - NIGHT

With the city skyline in the b.g., the Ghostbusters prepare their

equipment.  Each of them dons a makeshift backpack consisting of tanks,

hoses, nozzles and an abundance of gauges, valves and regulators.

Venkman looks up at the Statue of Liberty looming above them.

Stantz is looking worried.

They enter the statue.

INT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY - MOMENTS LATER

The Ghostbusters are working from the iron staircase that spirals

straight up 100 feet inside the hollow super-structure of the statue.

Spengler and Winston are busy assembling hundreds of wires connected to

various relays on the interior surface of the statue.  Venkman and Stantz

are mounting large auditorium loudspeakers near the top of the staircase.

They finish the installation, then Stantz dons one of the new backpacks

and gives the order.

They begin hosing the inside of the statue with the psycho-reactive

slime.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

pulls up, Louis climbs aboard and finds Slimer behind the wheel.

INT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY - OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER

Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston are standing in the observation

windows in the crown of the statue.  It looks like they're on the bridge

of an ocean liner, then the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the head of the

statue.

STANTZ

He plugs the main cable lead into a transformer.

Venkman plugs the speaker cable into a Walkman and gives a downbeat.

He hits "Play" on the Walkman and "HIGHER AND HIGHER" BOOMS from the huge

SPEAKERS, amplified by the statue's vast hollow interior.

INT.  OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The head of the statue lurches suddenly, but the Ghostbusters cling to

the rail and manage to keep their feet.

Stantz picks up a Nintendo control paddle from a home video game and

starts pushing the buttons.

They feel a strong vibration and the statue starts to move.

INT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Spengler reads the Giga-meter.

EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT (LATER)

The avenue has been closed to traffic and barricades placed, blocking all

the side streets.  A squadron of police motorcycles comes speeding around

shakes and the Statue of Liberty comes walking around the corner onto

Fifth Avenue followed by a wildly cheering throng.

the canvas.

INT.  MUSEUM - JANOSZ - NIGHT

The baby's body begins to glow as Vigo reaches out for it.  Then suddenly

a dark shadow falls across the skylight.  Janosz looks up.

INT.  MUSEUM - JANOSZ'S POV - SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

The Statue of Liberty is looming over the skylight looking down on Janosz

with an expression of righteous anger on it's face.

EXT.  MUSEUM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Kneeling beside the museum, the statue draws back it's mighty right arm

and smashes the skylight with its torch.

INT.  RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Janosz retreats from the shower of broken glass as the Ghostbusters come

sliding down ropes into the studio and confront Janosz with their new

weapons.  Quick as a flash, Dana seizes the moment, dashes across the

studio and snatches the baby from Vigo's outstretched arms.

INT.  MUSEUM - VIGO PAINTING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Vigo bellows in rage.

INT.  MUSEUM - STUDIO - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Janosz steps in front of the painting.

Janosz sneers, trusting the invincibility of Vigo.

With that, the Ghostbusters fire their slime-blowers and hose Janosz from

head to toe, blowing him into the corner.  Then they turn to Vigo.

VIGO

He is now almost completely out of the painting, but still held from the

knees down.  He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters, trying to unleash

his magic powers.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been

neutralized by the good will of the people.

Suddenly Vigo grabs Stantz by the neck and holds him up as a shield.

Winston fires and hoses both Vigo and Ray.

VIGO

He bellows and drops Ray, then falls back into the painting.

INT.  MUSEUM - PAINTING - NIGHT

The paint turns liquid, melts off the canvas and runs onto the floor

revealing another painting underneath it.

INT.  MUSEUM - GHOSTBUSTERS - NIGHT (AFTER BATTLE)

Venkman, Spengler and Winston rush over to Ray and kneel beside him.  He

is completely covered with slime and motionless.

Winston wipes the slime off Ray's face and Ray opens his eyes.

They pull him to his feet.

He hugs them each in turn, leaving them slimed as well.  Venkman recoils

in disgust.

Venkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby.  She hugs Venkman.

He picks up the baby.

They hug and kiss.

SPENGLER, WINSTON AND STANTZ

They help Janosz to his feet.  He's dazed but unhurt.

As they exit they stop to examine the painting that was concealed by

Vigo's self-portrait.

INT.  MUSEUM - NEW PAINTING - NIGHT

It's a beautiful painting in the high-Renaissance style depicting four

archangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby.  One holds a harp,

one, an olive branch, the third, a book, and the last, a sword.  Most

remarkably, their faces bear an uncanny resemblance to Venkman, Stantz,

Spengler and Winston.

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

A city bus pulls up near the museum and Louis steps off.  He waves his

thanks to Slimer who is behind the wheel.

SLIMER GRUNTS and SLOBBERS a reply, flexing his scrawny biceps.

EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT (LITTLE LATER)

The Ghostbusters are greeted by wild cheering and applause as they come

out the main entrance with Dana and the baby.  Everybody starts singing

"Auld Lang Syne."  Louis picks his way through the celebrating crowd and

finds the Ghostbusters.

Stantz pops the cork on a bottle of champagne and hands it to him.

EXT.  MUSEUM ENTRANCE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Hardemeyer staggers out of the museum covered in slime.  He looks at the

celebrating crowd and his eyes fill with tears.

He joins in on "Auld Lang Syne."

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT (LATER)

The Statue of Liberty is sprawled inert on her back in the park behind

the museum, her toga up over her knees.  The Mayor looks nearly suicidal.

The Ghostbusters stand beside him commiserating.

The Mayor looks at it and gasps at the amount.

Venkman looks at the Statue.

Realizing he has no alternative, the Mayor sighs and takes the bill back.

EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY (WEEKS LATER)

The sun is shining brightly and Liberty is back on her pedestal where she

belongs.  The Mayor and a host of officials are commemorating her return.

The Ghostbusters, Dana, Janine and Louis are there as honored guests.

They all look up at the Statue.

EXT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY - HEAD OF STATUE - DAY

Slimer flies out one of the observation windows, THEME MUSIC KICKS IN and

the CAMERA PULLS UP and AWAY FROM the island TO a HIGH SHOT of the

Statue, lower Manhattan and the shining sea beyond.
