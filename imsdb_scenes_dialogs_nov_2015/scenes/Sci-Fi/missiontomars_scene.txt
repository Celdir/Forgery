FADE IN:

EXT. LATE AFTERNOON SKY

Blue sky, a few puffs of cloud, pierced by slanting rays of

sunlight. Late afternoon on a perfect day.

SUPER TITLE: "HOUSTON, TEXAS. JULY 4, 2020."

As we hear, after a few more beats, an ASTRONAUT'S VOICE.

A tiny red streak zips into the sky, then bursts with a faint,

ludicrous POP. A bottle rocket. We hear CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER,

excited SHOUTS.

EXT. LAWN PARTY. LUKE GRAHAM'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON

DESCENDING, we see PHIL OHLMYER, late 20's, kneeling, with a

gaggle of eager CHILDREN around him. Phil, an astronaut, has

got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using

an empty longneck as his launching tube.

Derisive GROANS from the kids, more SHOUTS. Phil grins.

There's little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruiting

poster: he's messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for

silence.

Another astronaut, RENEE COTE, a tall, very fit French woman,

is walking by with a fresh six-pack. She tosses a beer and

Phil catches it.

ANGLE FOLLOWS COTE

Who grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin

to get a better sense of the scope of this party. We are in

the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb.

DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel, and their

families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out

blankets. Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of

balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavored,

from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed

about. A banner, strung between trees, reads "BON VOYAGE,

MARS ONE!!!"

Passing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut,

NICHOLAS WILLIS, who snags it neatly. He's got his other arm

around the waist of a PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME,

ANGLE LINGERS on these two. Willis, a very young astronaut,

early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all

too well.

As the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and

walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open his

beer, swigs it.

ANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As she swerves around an open-

pit barbecue, where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered. Cote has

paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. SERGEI

KIROV, a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as

they play a game of wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily

at the chef.

WOODY BLAKE, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat

over a Hawaiian shirt and a "KISS THE CHEF" apron. An entire

pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting

this as he smiles at Malik.

He grins teasingly at Cote, who makes a face at him.

DR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes by with a platter of

corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, a face made attractive

by its alert, questing intelligence. She pauses to kiss

Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them.

Then she glances at Kirov, all business now.

He's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at Cote, who

smiles, nods her cool agreement.

The other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, as

Terri moves on. Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-watt

grin.

The others laugh.

ANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI as she dodges a PACK OF KIDS -- they run

by her, shrieking happily - before she finally reaches a

picnic table, where ASTRONAUTS' WIVES are opening containers

of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad.

One of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st

Wife turns, sees Terri setting down her platter.

Laughter at this. Terri smiles politely -- she doesn't really

have much in common with these women -- before moving on.

ANGLE LINGERS on the wives, who watch her go with a slight

tinge of jealousy. One of them is looking around.

She shakes her head, awed by the thought. The others nod in

agreement, following her glance...

In the distance, a lone MALE FIGURE stands by the garage,

his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and SUVs

which stretch down the driveway and along the street. Another

figure, a WOMAN, can be seen approaching him.

CLOSER ANGLE FOLLOWS the moving woman -- DEBRA GRAHAM, early

30s, very attractive -- until she reaches her husband. LUKE

GRAHAM, mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the

restless intellect of a scientist. He's unaware of her

approach until she touches his shoulder. He looks at her

with an apologetic smile.

He looks at her, moved. She summons a smile. He slides his

arms around her waist, kisses her forehead.

He kisses her again, then goes. Debra's eyes follow him,

with a mixture of pride and sadness.

ANGLE FOLLOWS Luke away from the garage, into

EXT. THE BACK YARD. LATE AFTERNOON

Luke moves through the crowd. Phil and the kids are still

shooting off rockets. Red streaks arc high overhead.

In the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes

Willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to

PRETTY GIRL #2.

Luke shakes his head. Willis is incorrigible. Finally he

reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder.

A SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms around

his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nearby

on a tripod. He looks lonely.

Luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him.

BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at

the sky.

Luke is surprised by the question. A pause.

His voice is unexpectedly fierce. He's fighting back tears.

Luke is moved. Another brief silence.

Bobby manages a smile. He nods, feeling a little better.

Luke is proud of his son's courage.

Bobby's arms go around his father's neck. He hugs Luke

fiercely, and Luke hugs him back. His eyes, over the thin

young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence.

Then, from the distance, the sound of an APPROACHING CAR.

They both turn.

An open Jeep is coming down the street. Its DRIVER is alone.

Luke's expression changes. Recognition, then happiness.

EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON

The Jeep stops, its electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver

climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes

out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon.

The PARTY SOUNDS are drifting this way, and he hesitates a

moment, seeming to gather himself. He starts gamely towards

the party, then pauses again.

Debra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. She

smiles tentatively.

JIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages a smile in return. He has

dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in.

Yet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet

competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural

leader.

Debra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. They

separate, looking at each other. Her eyes are shining.

Over her shoulder he sees Luke approaching, his arm around

Bobby. The two men look at each other, the bond between them

so strong it needs no words. Finally Luke smiles.

McConnell comes towards him, accompanied by Debra, and

together the four of them move OUT OF FRAME, heading towards

the party. ANGLE HOLDS on the parking area, as we...

EXT. SAME VIEW. NIGHT (HOURS LATER)

All the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two:

McConnell's Jeep and Woody's classic 'Vette. Willis, one of

the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle. Perched

behind him, arms around his waist, is PRETTY GIRL #3. They

zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood.

EXT. BACK YARD. NIGHT

The yard is nearly deserted. The "Bon Voyage" banner has

torn loose at one end and flutters limply. Here and there a

napkin blows across the ground.

In the distance, THREE FIGURES sit on the ground, by the

waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers.

CLOSER ON THIS TRIO

As Woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames. For a

moment he, McConnell, and Luke are silent, staring at the

sparks as they rise towards the stars -- red and gold dots

mingling with the silver ones.

The intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even

Woody himself. Luke glances at McConnell. An awkward beat.

He grabs playfully at Woody's neck. Woody smacks his hand

away, laughing.

He pulls from his shirt a little Flash Gordon rocketship

emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at

McConnell, as Luke and McConnell laugh.

Luke grabs Woody's arm to give McConnell a better shot at

the emblem, but Woody cuffs his hands away, laughing.

McConnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head.

He tries to smile, but his face reddens. Then all at once

his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions.

Woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but McConnell

shakes him off, rises abruptly. He turns his back on them,

walking away a few steps.

Woody and Luke exchange a worried glance.

EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATER THAT NIGHT

McConnell and Luke watch as Woody starts up his Corvette.

McConnell has regained his composure.

Woody revs the engine, which ROARS lustily. He grins.

Luke laughs. Woody looks at McConnell.

Woody reaches out to shake Luke's hand.

With a final glance at McConnell, Woody slips the car into

gear. McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away. A silence.

Luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious. We

sense he's been waiting all night for a chance to say this.

McConnell, looking after Woody's car, becomes very still.

McConnell turns to him, his eyes flashing danger. He will

not tolerate pity. Luke sees this but presses on.

McConnell is deeply moved, and for a moment doesn't trust

his own voice.

Luke nods. They grab hands for a second, then let go. Luke

walks back towards his house. McConnell watches him for a

moment, then turns, walks over to his Jeep. He opens his

door, then pauses. He turns. Looks up at --

EXT. NIGHT SKY

A tiny reddish dot hovers there, glowing steadily. Mars

itself, a tantalizing prize. But for him now, more distant

than ever. For him, perhaps, never to be attained.

CLOSE ON MCCONNELL'S FACE

As we see these thoughts going through him. After a moment

he looks down at

HIS SHOES

And the sandy verge of the front yard.

MCCONNELL'S EYES

Are a map of complex emotions: regret, injured pride, infinite

yearning. Gently, a bit self-consciously, HE LIFTS ONE SHOE

And sets it down again, making a careful, deliberate footprint

in the sandy soil...

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. MARS. CHRYSE PLANITIA. DAY

Instantly we're hurled into an immense, stunning LANDSCAPE,

mysterious and vivid as a fever dream. Dazzling sunlight. A

vast plain of rust-orange soil. Countless craters. Boulders

the size of houses, tossed about by the hands of gods. Twin

moons hanging in a salmon-pink sky. On the horizon, towering,

craggy peaks. And, at center -- the only sign of life -- a

small, mysterious, moving puff of dust.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. MARS. DAY

CLOSER ANGLE as a small, Sojourner-like, multi-wheeled robotic

vehicle ambles INTO FRAME, jouncing along the orange Martian

soil, pausing to snuffle its sensors towards the occasionally

interesting rock. Lettering on its side reads "ARES-8."

SUPER TITLE: "MARS. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. EIGHT MONTHS LATER."

Suddenly Ares-8 pauses. Its video lens WHIRRS out, fine-tuning

focus, as it becomes intrigued by something OFFSCREEN -- a

higher, more distant target. The little fellow almost quivers

with excitement.

EXT. MARS. TIU VALLIS. DAY

A one-man ATV ROVER waits in the background, in a dry

streambed, as Luke, in an EVA spacesuit, swings a clawed

rock hammer against a multi-layered, sedimentary rock face.

Reddish dust coats his bulky white suit. Despite that bulk,

he moves easily in the light Martian gravity (1/3 Earth's).

A hunk of rock breaks off, and Luke examines it more closely,

holding it up to his clear faceplate. He's very happy,

absorbed in this work, when his RADIO CRACKLES.

Luke, though reluctant to break off work, is intrigued.

As Luke turns away, headed for the rover

WE PULL WIDE

To REVEAL a STAGGERING PROSPECT, seen for the first time:

Valles Marineris, that planet-creasing slash. So wide, so

deep, it boggles the mind: on earth it would reach from New

York to L.A.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

The crew of Mars One - Kirov, Willis, and Cote -- have joined

Luke, gathered around some display monitors. They're in NASA

jumpsuits; the Hab has artificial atmosphere, enhanced

gravity, and heat. All are captivated by what they see. ON A

VIDEO SCREEN

We see a low-angle image of an elongated, rubble and dirt-

covered MOUNTAIN. Hard to tell scale, but it looks huge.

What's most striking, however, is a WHITE PEAK barely

protruding through the rubble two-thirds of the way along

the mountain's ridgeline. Its whiteness is in clear contrast

to the typical rust-orange of the surrounding rubble; what's

more, this strange little peak also displays an oddly-smooth,

multi-planed symmetry.

Cote glances at the others. They're all smirking, as if they

share some secret joke Luke's not yet in on.

He leans over to read a digital gauge, but Cote covers it

with her hand, enjoying the tease.

They all laugh as the other shoe drops. Luke's expression is

incredulous, exasperated.

Luke sits, taking over the Ares remote control from Cote.

They all watch as he fine tunes the image, trying without

success to coax more resolution.

The others look at him, puzzled. Luke leans in closer, with

growing excitement. He points to the screen.

They look at each other, Luke's excitement now leaping from

one to another of them. They're almost trembling.

EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY

AIRLOCK DOORS

Slide back, REVEALING the crew in EVA suits, carrying gear.

They walk over to...

THE FOUR-MAN ROVER

The astronauts climb in through the hatch. The last one in

pulls it shut behind him and locks the latches. We see Cote

and Luke check their screens and press some buttons. Luke

puts the rover in drive.

WIDER ANGLE, PULLING UP AND AWAY

As the rover moves off across the rocky surface, dust kicking

up from the wheels, we get our first exterior glimpse of the

Mars One Base Camp. The main HAB UNIT looks like a huge tuna

can with a conical top section; it connects to a separate,

inflated-bubble GREENHOUSE. There's also an OXYGEN STILL,

PROPELLANT PLANT, and, on the other side, a couple hundred

meters distant, the massive ERV (Earth Return Vehicle), which

arrived as a separate, unmanned flight.

Rows of SOLAR PANELS, arrayed on the ground, and an AMERICAN

FLAG on a thin pole, about man-height, complete the scene.

EXT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISP). EARTH ORBIT. DAY

A vast, impressive, MULTI-SECTIONED SPACECRAFT is drifting

majestically above Earth. The main hull displays both NASA

and U.N. flag decals.

SUPER TITLE: "INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MARS MISSION

CONTROL ROOM (MMCR). 20 MINUTE TIME LAG."

We MOVE IN towards another of the station's segments, which

is dedicated entirely (as we see from more labels and

insignias) to the Mars Program: Control Room, Training and

Living Quarters, and a Vehicle Docking and Launch Area, where

Mars Two is already positioned for its eventual flight. We

hear LUKE'S EXCITED VOICE, over speakers.

INT. MMCR. DAY

On a large CENTER DISPLAY SCREEN, we see Luke and the Mars

One crew, sitting around their kitchen table in the Hab,

finishing lunch while taping this VIDEO MESSAGE.

He looks at his crew. They beam like cats who ate canaries.

IN THE MMCR

There's an EXCITED BUZZ among the assembled TECHNICIANS,

FLIGHT ENGINEERS, and SCIENTISTS. This would be a fantastic,

epochal discovery.

MCCONNELL

Sits at the center console, wearing a headset. He's now the

Mars One CAPCOM (Capsule Communicator), and his manner is

brisk, efficient, all-business. A TECHNICIAN leans in for

instructions.

The technician nods, hurries away. McConnell, sharing the

intense excitement of those around him, stares up at

THE SCREEN

Where Luke and his crew are still smiling, well knowing the

excitement their bombshell will create.

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

The rover is a hundred meters away and moving fast TOWARDS

CAMERA. We BOOM DOWN to REVEAL Ares-8, still faithfully

holding its point, like an Irish Setter, with its video snout

WHIRRING OUT.

The rover drives up and slows to a stop nearby. The hatch

door cracks open and some dust vents out. The door opens all

the way and the astronauts climb out. They all look up in

awe. We hear their voices ON RADIOS.

THE MYSTERIOUS PEAK

Gleams in the sun, dazzling white, its facets as planed and

smooth as if an architect had drawn them. It pierces through

the topmost rubble at the near end of the big mountain -- an

isolated, butte-like giant, stretching two miles from left

to right in front of them.

THE ASTRONAUTS

Walk towards the mountain. There's a very deep, very low,

staccato tone intruding over their headsets.

As they go to their jobs, the deep, barely audible rumbling

tone continues.

INT. SPACE STATION. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MMCR. DAY

MULTINATIONAL CREWMEMBERS walk by, in the artificial gravity

of the busy station, as RAY BECK, mid-50s, approaches from

the opposite direction. Beck is the tough, crewcut, PR-savvy

head of the NASA Mars Program (ID'd by his name tag), and

just now he's leading a covey of U.N. AMBASSADORS on a tour.

The ambassadors, of both sexes, many nations, and all races,

look as excited as schoolkids.

He opens the doors, ushering his flock inside.

INT. MMCR. DAY

The ambassadors enter, oohing and ahhing over the impressive

array of gadgetry and personnel, and especially over the big

screen. Some of them start taking souvenir snaphots. The

NIGERIAN AMBASSADOR turns to Beck, whispering curiously.

BECK FOLLOWS HIS GLANCE TO

MCCONNELL

Who is surrounded by a KNOT OF TECHNICIANS, to whom he is

giving quiet, precise instructions. They hover, then depart,

like so many eager bees.

BECK

Smiles indulgently at the ambassador's misunderstanding.

ON THE SCREEN

Luke and his crew have finished eating, and are clearing

away their dishes and leftovers.

Cote clears her throat, gives Luke a look. The others can

barely conceal their grins.

McConnell looks at the screen, worried. What's Luke up to?

A look of relief comes over McConnell.

McConnell winces -- Dear God, no -- as, on the screen, Kirov

appears from OFF CAMERA holding a cupcake with a burning

candle stuck in it, and the Mars One crew starts SINGING

"Happy Birthday" to him. Loudly. And very off-key.

Soon most everyone in MMCR is singing along -- even some of

the jolly ambassadors -- with the noticeable exception of

Beck, who stiffens unhappily. McConnell is mortified.

Beck looks over at McConnell, who indeed is red in the face

with a fake "I'm-a-good-sport" grin.

Indeed, Beck's smile is thin, sour, disapproving.

Luke and the crew finish singing the song. Luke raises the

cupcake in a toast.

He and his crew lean in, blow out the candle. They laugh and

applaud, then wave goodbye.

Luke reaches out, turns OFF the CAMERA, and the display screen

GOES BLACK.

Beck turns, his gaze locking with McConnell's. He's annoyed,

as if this violation of protocol were somehow McConnell's

fault. McConnell returns his stare coolly.

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

Cote stands by a display screen mounted on the rover. Kirov

has a big radar gun on a tripod, pointing at the mountain.

Luke turns to Cote.

Luke doesn't understand. He walks up to look at the display

screen.

The deep pulsing tone continues. Luke frowns.

INT. MMCR. DAY

McConnell is taping an audio message to be sent to Mars as

the rest of MMCR looks on. Beck is gone. So are the U. N.

ambassadors.

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

Cote and Kirov are close to the foot of the mountain,

resetting the radar gun on its tripod. The deep vibrating

tone continues.

Luke is some distance away, by the rover. He looks at Willis,

who's still working on the rover's antenna.

Cote and Kirov are having some trouble with the switches on

the radar gun. They turn towards Luke and Willis.

Willis looks at Luke. Luke nods -- Go help them. Willis starts

towards the radar gun.

INT. MMCR. DAY

McConnell is handed a slip of paper, glances at it.

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

Willis, Cote, and Kirov get the radar gun up and running.

Luke sidles over to the display screen on the rover.

INT. MMCR. DAY

McConnell checks over his clipboard list of updates.

LAUGHTER in the MMCR.

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

Luke watches the screen on the rover, as, by the mound...

KIROV

Flips a switch on the radar gun, then swivels its muzzle

slowly across the near slope of the mountain. We hear and

feel the radar signal. The immediate result is that the

pulsing tone we've been hearing suddenly stops.

LUKE

Looks up from the display screen. A puzzled expression.

A split-second later, he gets his answer. We hear a WHOOSH,

a mighty rushing of wind, as

A GIGANTIC, TRANSLUCENT CYLINDER

Starts to swirl and rise, straight up from the top or the

mountain, at its center. As it swirls, the cylinder picks up

debris -- pebbles, sand -- from the sediment-encrusted surface

of the slopes.

THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS

Stare up at this spectacle, awed. A cyclone? Some kind of

energy wave? They have no idea. At the moment they're too

fascinated to even be scared.

TILTING UP - FROM THEIR POV

We see the whirling cylinder rise, higher and higher,

perfectly straight, until in just moments it's as tall as a

skyscraper. As it rises, it gains speed and power, narrowing

at its top into a conical vortex. It's sucking up so much

dirt, so many rocks -- even small boulders now -- that the

accumulating debris begins to darken its swirling, translucent

outer "skin".

THE ASTRONAUTS

Exchange amazed glances. Can't believe their eyes...

INT. MMCR. DAY

McConnell still hovers by the microphone.

LAUGHTER and GROANS from the staff in MMCR.

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

Luke, still staring in fascination, becomes aware of sand

and pebbles flashing past his helmet. From behind. He turns.

SAND PATTERS AGAINST HIS FACEPLATE

As the nearby landscape BLURS. The vacuuming effect is

becoming more general across the area. More violent.

LUKE IS ALARMED

And the spell is broken. He keys his throat mike, his lips

moving, but no sound can be heard over the ROARING WIND. He

waves his arms, motioning for the others to back away, towards

the rover. Wind whips at their EVA suits as they obey him,

retreating.

Luke, backing away himself, is afraid to take his eyes off

the cylinder.

Then he sees that one man -- Willis -- hasn't moved. In fact

he's busily snapping photographs of the cylinder. Luke hurries

over to him, tugs his sleeve.

WILLIS LOWERS HIS CAMERA

But still stares up, transfixed, like a man face to face

with a cobra. Luke follows the young astronaut's frightened

gaze, and his own eyes widen as he sees

THE TOP OF THE VORTEX

Beginning to tilt down, then coil sideways. Suddenly they're

looking into the huge open "mouth" of it, as sand and rocks

fly into the swirling darkness...

The monstrous, gaping maw slithers down over the rim of the

mountain, turning this way, then that. Seeking them. And

then, with horrifying precision, it locks in on the little

group of astronauts. And lunges towards them...

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

Luke and Willis turn, running as hard as they can towards

the rover. But the suction is so great, it's as if they're

held back by wires.

The ground itself is SHAKING, RUMBLING, as earthquakes begin

to open fissures across the plain. The ROAR of the vortex,

the GROANING of the earth, are like an onrushing freight

train...

AHEAD OF THEM

In the maelstrom of flying debris, they can barely make out

Cote and Kirov, still retreating, leaning back with all their

strength against the suction, while staring up, aghast.

Suddenly a hurtling rock, the size of a basketball, smashes

into Cote's helmet from behind, crushing it and killing her

instantly. Blood sprays into the wind, immediately

crystallizing, in the sub-zero atmosphere, into red pellets...

LUKE, HORRIFIED, FLINGS HIS ARM UP

As bloody hail patters against his faceplate and forearm. An

instant later he sees

KIROV

Snatched up by the wind, then swept past him, in a terrifying

blur, arms and legs flailing, mouth open in a silent scream

as he vanishes...

THE GROUND AT LUKE'S FEET

Abruptly opens, and he slides into a fissure. Scrabbling

frantically with his gloved hands, he manages to momentarily

arrest his fall, gripping the edge of the fault line, with

his helmet and one elbow thrust over its lip. The air is

almost solidly choked with debris, deadly boulders bound

over him, and torrents of cascading sand are burying him

alive...

CLOSE ON LUKE

Barely conscious, as he watches, for a horrifying final

instant, as...

HIS LAST CREWMAN, WILLIS

Is sucked bodily into the black maw of the vortex, spinning

and tumbling like a rag doll...

CLOSE ON WILLIS'S FACE

His features grotesquely distorted by the forces tearing at

him, before suddenly his faceplate is sprayed with blood,

and...

DISTANT ANGLE - LUKE'S POV

Willis's spacesuit explodes, his entire body disintegrating

into a million bits, which instantly disappear into the

hellish maelstrom. And then that maelstrom itself, just as

abruptly...

STOPS. Vanishes.

There is an instant, ringing SILENCE, as awesome in its own

way as the roaring storm itself had been...

WIDE ANGLE

On the plain, as the last pebbles, released from suction,

pitter down, bouncing. Swirls of dust and sand drift away,

settling gently. The harsh orange landscape is once again

calm, peaceful.

And then, from the direction of the nearby mountain, we hear

another sound: the deep bass pulsing rumble returns.

INT. MMCR. DAY

As McConnell finishes his message to Luke.

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

MOVING ANGLE, the CAMERA EXPLORING ground zero, as the bass,

pulsing rumble continues...

WE PASS the Rover, canted sideways into a little crater,

with its canopy missing, one axle fractured, but miraculously

still with all four wheels...

WE PASS faithful little ARES-8, lying on its side, partially

crushed under a boulder. It gives a final, pitiful WHINE,

its video snout slowly extending, then dies. And finally we

come to the area where the fissure had been, and see

THE FISSURE HAS BEEN FILLED IN

Leaving only a slender crease of umber sand. No sign of Luke.

The pulsing rumble continues, over, as we see

EXT. AERIAL VIEW. DAY

An extraordinary sight, seen from high in the air, looking

back down. Staring up at us from the bottom of a shallow

crater, scoured clean of its aeons of accumulated silt and

rubble, is a structure resembling a vast humanoid Face.

The surface is gleaming white, apparently metallic. The

features are suggested by intricately interlocking planes,

slopes, ramps. The "eyes" -- hatches of some kind? -- are

closed, and the overall expression is eerily calm, but

terrible in its power, like some ancient tribal mask.

We see the Face clearly for only a few beats before thick,

scudding clouds OBSCURE it, but the deep, pulsing rumble

continues, low and insistent...

INT. MARS TWO (DOCKED). COCKPIT. DAY

We're inside the Mars Two spacecraft, which is still in its

docked position alongside the Space Station.

Woody Blake, wearing a NASA jumpsuit, floats up into the

cockpit in Zero-G, studying a thick manual.

He straps into the pilot's seat, staring at an electrical

junction box at one end of the console.

He swings open the housing, revealing a bewildering tangle

of fuses and wires. He sighs heavily, as Terri drifts up

beside him, also in a jumpsuit, and straps into the co-pilot's

seat.

He peers into the housing with exaggerated concern. But

Terri's not so easily sidetracked.

Reaching past him, she pulls out the required breaker. As he

reacts, surprised, she smiles, despite her exasperation.

Overhead, an intercom CRACKLES. We hear PHIL.

Woody and Terri exchange a worried look. What's wrong?

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY

A crisis atmosphere prevails. The big room is more crowded

than we've ever seen it, with ENGINEERS and MANAGERS hurrying

by, huddling in tense, conferring knots, or muttering

feverishly into microphones.

On the center screen, a giant image of Mars. A frantic flow

of green numbers crawls above and below this, and the site

of the Mars One Base Camp is marked in blinking red.

WOODY AND HIS CREW

Are staring up at this screen, appalled. McConnell and Beck

stand nearby, briefing them.

Looks are exchanged among the Mars Two crew.

He leans over, punches buttons on a keyboard.

ON THE CENTER SCREEN

An orange dot can be seen in its orbital ellipse around Mars,

leaving a glowing electronic trail. This dot gets isolated

in a viewing box, then enlarged and rotated into the computer-

animated image of a small, ugly, industrial-looking unmanned

cargo craft, labelled "REMO."

INT. MMCR. DAY

FINGERS press buttons on a console. McConnell, Woody, Terri,

and Phil are crowded around a monitor with Beck and two weary

TECHNICIANS.

The technician nods, then gestures to his assistant who hits

a play button.

CLOSE ON A MONITOR

Black for a moment, then static. Out of this static comes a

faint image of Luke, sitting alone at the Hab kitchen table.

He looks awful -- dried blood on his face, bloodshot eyes.

The image is blurry, heavily streaked, and most of what he

says is lost in waves of static.

Woody, Terri and Phil look at each other -- Oh, God.

The monitor screen GOES BLACK.

INT. MMCR. DAY

Woody and his crew stare at the screen, stunned. This is a

catastrophe almost too huge to grasp.

INT. SPACE STATION. DAY

As Beck leads McConnell and the other shaken astronauts down

a corridor, Phil pauses, seeing...

A SOBBING TECHNICIAN

At her desk. TWO CO-WORKERS are trying to comfort her. One

of these women looks up, and her reddened eyes meet...

PHIL'S EYES

He looks back at her, haunted.

INT. SPACE STATION. DAY

In an otherwise empty lounge, the astronauts clutch Styrofoam

coffee cups. Beck stands nearby. Through a large viewport

behind them, stars glitter against the inky blackness.

McConnell and Woody exchange a glance... Woody's right.

McConnell looks at him, nods. They're on the same wavelength.

But Beck is more cautious.

Terri looks at Phil -- SIMA?

A tense beat. Again we sense the test of wills between these

two tough-minded men, once good friends.

A pause with beck weighing the odds. He looks at Woody.

He looks at Woody, Phil and Terri, who are just as eager.

McConnell exits followed by Terri and Phil, but as Beck starts

out, too, Woody stops him.

Beck looks at him a moment, nods.

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY

In a quiet corner, Woody and Beck are alone.

Beck's expression hardens.

Beck and Woody stare at each other. A long tense beat.

This stops Woody, just for a beat. Then makes him press on

harder, with even greater intensity.

Beck looks back at him, his features taunt.

INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY

Woody, Terri, and Phil stand at the edge of the big control

room, waiting and watching, in a tense silence, as

IN THE DISTANCE, FROM THEIR POV

Beck and McConnell are huddled together at the CAPCOM's

console. Other personnel have moved away, giving them room.

Both men are seated, leaning forward, with McConnell listening

intently, while Beck does most of the talking, very quietly.

After a moment McConnell looks up in surprise. His eyes search

the room till they find

WOODY'S FACE

Woody looks back at him, nods: C'mon, man. Take it.

MCCONNELL'S OWN FACE

Is a study in conflicting emotions. But after a moment he

masters his feelings, turns back toward Beck. A few more

quiet words are exchanged, then Beck offers his hand.

McConnell hesitates, then shakes it. Both men rise, and

McConnell turns again to look towards

WOODY, TERRI, AND PHIL

Who react with relief, glad that he's now a part of their

crew. Woody grins, giving him a thumb's up.

CLOSE ON MCCONNELL'S FACE

As he smiles. Then he starts towards them, with a new energy

in his step, a new sense of confidence and purpose. And as

he WALKS TOWARDS US, PASSING OUT OF FRAME...

EXT. DEEP SPACE. MARS RECOVERY. DAY

An infinite canopy of stars. After a moment, some of them

begin to be BLOTTED OUT as

A SPACESHIP

Glides INTO VIEW. "MARS RECOVERY" (formerly Mars Two) looks

much like its sister craft on Mars: a conical cockpit mounted

above a "tuna can" crew Hab module.

SUPER TITLE: "MARS RECOVERY. MISSION DAY 172."

The entire lower deck forms a segmented section of the hull

that rotates on bearings to provide artificial gravity; we

see window ports spinning past, then an American flag emblem.

Behind this lower deck, in an extending network of struts,

like the abdomen of a dragonfly, are the three huge round

PROPELLANT TANKS. Then vast, delicate-looking rectangular

SOLAR PANELS, which sweep out to either side of the ship;

these also bear the dish of the earth-pointing HI-GAIN

ANTENNA. And finally comes the great mass of the ENGINE BELLS,

housed within a curving AEROSHELL; three hatches in the

aeroshell can open to allow the main thrusters to fire through

for a mid-course burn.

CAMERA DRIFTS CLOSER

To the forward section of the ship, APPROACHING a viewport

in the EVA airlock chamber. Inside, we can see Phil leaning

forward, concentrating on some task...

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY. A BUNCH OF M&MS

Are floating in mid-air, forming an intricate 3D pattern. In

the EVA airlock, it's zero G.

Phil, strapped into a chair by a galley counter, is just

completing this weightless puzzle by placing a final blue

M&M. He looks bored, sluggish. In the b.g., Terri is hunched

over a microscope.

McConnell emerges from the core tunnel, behind them, coming

up from the lower Hab, then pushes off from the ladder,

floating towards Phil. He grins, admiring Phil's obsessive

handiwork.

He plucks out a couple of the M&Ms as he drifts by.

McConnell grins, snacking on the M&Ms.

Phil looks sadly at his floating model.

McConnell and Terri laugh as Phil starts scarfing down the

rest of the M&Ms. Swooping at them with both hands.

He's drifted to another short ladder, and now grabs it, starts

up to the cockpit, atop the Hab.

INT. COCKPIT. DAY

As McConnell appears in the cockpit, he sees Woody by the

forward instrumentation panel, looking at a monitor. The

cockpit is also zero G.

McConnell pulls himself forward.

ANGLE ON MONITOR

MARS completely fills the screen. Surface details are clearly

visible. Something is moving down there, an amorphous brown

swirl.

INT. COCKPIT. DAY

McConnell pulls back from the screen, looks at Woody.

A beat. They both hope he's wrong.

They exchange a glance. Woody's right, but the thought is

too terrible to dwell on. McConnell looks back at Mars.

INT. MARS RECOVERY. EVA AIRLOCK. NEXT MORNING

CLOSE ON A DIGITAL CLOCK

Just turning over to read "0545."

TERRI

Pulls her gaze away from these numbers. Judging from her

redrimmed eyes, it's been a long, anxious night. Restlessly,

looking to distract herself, she reaches for a test tube of

blood, straps it into a centrifuge, sets it spinning. Nearby

is her electron microscope.

MCCONNELL (LOWER HAB)

Lies on his cot in his own cubicle, with the door closed.

The lower hab has artificial gravity (AG) and McConnell can

move normally. Hands behind his head, he stares at his bureau.

PHOTO OF A WOMAN

Rests there, in its leather travel frame. Beautiful, smiling,

dark-haired: MAGGIE MCCONNELL. Her face glows with

intelligence and energy.

MCCONNELL

Shifts his eyes. The clock on his bulkhead reads "0546."

PHIL (LOWER HAB)

Stands in the communal bathroom, still in his pajamas, a

towel around his shoulders, brushing his teeth. He glances

at another digital clock, which reads "0547." Shakes his

head impatiently. He looks back into the mirror, then is

surprised to hear MUSIC lilting incongruously over the

loudspeakers: Elvis Presley's "Blue Moon."

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY

Phil floats in through the connecting tunnel, then stops

himself at a handhold. He grins, charmed by the sight of

WOODY AND TERRI DANCING

Like a weightless Fred and Ginger. Woody is surprisingly

good at this. Enthusiastic, unselfconscious.

He sweeps Terri gallantly about the little cabin, pushing

off from every handy surface, even guiding her into some

passable twirls and dips. She laughs, shaking her head.

She grins, kisses his ear, as Phil turns, sees

MCCONNELL

Who has now arrived, is also watching the dancing couple. A

twinge of sadness crosses his features. But when his eyes

meet Phil's, he shakes off the feeling and manages a smile:

Aren't they something?

Over the music, they hear a CHIRP from the SHIP'S COMPUTER,

then an announcement.

They all look at each other. This is it! Woody spins over to

a console, shuts off the music.

INT. COCKPIT. DAY. MINUTES LATER

The crew is gathered around a display screen. The lights are

dim, reflecting up off their faces. By their expressions, we

can tell the news is not good.

CLOSE ON THE SCREEN

It's a color, high-resolution satellite image of the Mars

One Base Camp. Ghostly, dust-covered. No signs of life.

They all scan the screen. Phil spots something.

He grabs a stylus and touches the screen. They all look.

CLOSE ON THE SCREEN

Using where the stylus touches the screen as the focal point,

the image enlarges. THREE LONGISH DIRT PILES appear, some

fifty meters from the hab.

McConnell gets it first.

They all realize he's right. They sit back, stunned. But

then Phil has another thought.

This quiets everyone for a long moment.

Phil keys in some commands and data pops up onscreen.

Phil uses the stylus to bring MORE IMAGES into view. The

frame moves over the terrain in the direction of the Face,

first in SWIFT BLURS, then slowing. Scattered rock debris

come into view. The IMAGE ARRIVES where the mountain was,

and they see...

Debris in every direction, NEAT SPIRALS of it now, dropped

uncannily into place, like some massive earth sculpture. As

if - but this makes no sense -- it had been swirled towards

a LARGE CRATER. The crater itself is a perfect circle. They

FOCUS on the CENTER OF THE CRATER, but the image gets

distorted by STATIC.

Phil tweaks the stylus, but the image won't clear up.

Phil works the keyboard.

THE SCREEN

Goes to INFRARED, reading heat, The middle of the IMAGE,

where the Face is, is still distorted, refusing focus.

THE ASTRONAUTS

Sit back, exasperated.

He leans closer, staring intently.

McConnell shakes his head. But his every sense is engaged;

he's like a predator just sighting his prey for the first

time. We see in his eyes an utter determination to unlock

this secret.

EXT. SPACE. DAY

Mars Recovery is speeding ever closer to Mars, which now

looms large, a dusty red mysterious sphere.

INT. MARS RECOVERY. LOWER HAB. DAY

McConnell and crew are eating dinner while they watch a taped

message from MMCR.

CLOSE ON MONITOR SCREEN

As Ray Beck addresses them. Other NASA STAFFERS, twenty or

more, have crowded in behind him, and we sense their great

hopefulness and high spirits; the whole team's triumph is

tantalizingly close now.

Beck takes a breath, smiles.

INT. MARS RECOVERY. LOWER HAB. DAY

WHOOPS OF JOY from McConnell's crew. Woody and Terri high

five each other.

The monitor screen GOES BLACK.

INT. MARS RECOVERY. LOWER HAB. NIGHT

The lighting is subdued for a sleep period, but everyone's

too restless. There's a low HUM of equipment.

INT. EVA AIRLOCK. NIGHT

Terri and Phil are playing computer Monopoly under a single

light. Terri is using touch-screen technology to move her

piece. She glances at Phil. He has spread some M&Ms out,

letting them drift in mid-air as he performs his ritual

weeding out of the red ones. She shakes her head.

He touches the screen to roll the dice.

INT. MARS RECOVERY. LOWER HAB. NIGHT

McConnell, in his cubicle, looks away from the photo of

Maggie. Haunted by memories. He rises, flips through the CDs

in a storage case, pulls one out. He holds this carefully,

hesitating, then feeds it into his computer. Immediately his

screen saver vanishes and we see

HOME VIDEO OF A PARTY

An impromptu celebration, a bunch of friends gathered in a

semi-darkened living room. The footage is HANDHELD, a bit

jerky. People have paper plates of food, beers in hand,

everyone is a little tipsy. Debra is there, Terri, Phil,

Cote, Kirov, others. They're watching a STILL PHOTO SEQUENCE,

shown on a large screen TV, with commentary by Luke and Woody.

THE FIRST PHOTO

Is of a small boy (YOUNG MCCONNELL) in his pajamas, kneeling

in front of a Christmas tree. He's grinning ecstatically as

he holds up a brand new model rocket.

LAUGHTER at this. Some AD LIB CRACKS about the painfully bad

haircut and the pajamas.

THE SECOND PHOTO

Is of a gawky-looking teenage girl (YOUNG MAGGIE), standing

on a porch at night, posing a bit self-consciously by a

telescope on its tripod.

More LAUGHTER, plus some digs about the nerdy eyeglasses and

braces. VIDEOCAMERA swings around the room, REVEALING the

adult JIM and MAGGIE. They sit side by side on the hearth,

leaning into each other, looking very happy.

More LAUGHTER. Everyone's having a great time. The VIDEOCAMERA

swings back towards the TV screen as

THIRD PHOTO APPEARS

Jim and Maggie, young adults, standing on the wing of a

fighter jet. Both in Air Force flight suits, helmets in hand.

Suntanned, cocky, flashing radiant smiles.

GROANS and LAUGHTER from the offscreen watchers.

FOURTH PHOTO APPEARS

Maggie and Jim, tethered together, floating weightlessly in

space suits.

A FIFTH PHOTO

Shows McConnell, in a dress uniform, leaning in to kiss

Maggie, who wears a white bridal gown.

ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, IN THE PRESENT

As he smiles at this, hearing the renewed LAUGHTER and CHEERS,

the AD-LIBBED DIGS from the video. He becomes aware he's not

alone. He looks up.

WOODY

Stands in the doorway of his cubicle. Their eyes meet. They

both smile, turning back to the video. Remembering.

IN THE VIDEO

Luke and Woody have stepped forward, INTO SHOT, standing at

the sides of the TV, where the last photo lingers. Luke waves

his hands, hushing everybody.

Both men raise champagne flutes.

CHEERS at this, repeats of "Jim and Maggie!" Luke grins,

giving a little signal, and we see

A FINAL PHOTO

Of Maggie in Jim's arms, both of them in goofy tropical

vacation wear, smiling. Evidently a photo taken in the surf

somewhere, but here it's been crudely superimposed onto a

Martian landscape. Laughter greets this unlikely image.

More hoots of LAUGHTER, CATCALLS, but Maggie jumps in to

protest, as the VIDEOCAMERA SWINGS TO HER AND JIM. Terri

sits nearby.

LAUGHTER at this, and Maggie joins in. She's a good sport.

The mood of the party is changing, as everyone is caught up

in Maggie's spell. She has a radiant simplicity. The VIDEO

CAMERA DRIFTS IN ON HER; we are caught up, too.

She looks at McConnell, smiles. He takes her hand.

A silence; the guests are enchanted by the purity of her

passion. She smiles, suddenly self-conscious. She hadn't

meant to get so carried away.

IN THE PRESENT - MCCONNELL

Reaches out, gently taps the keyboard, FREEZING the screen.

He and Woody, their eyes shining, stare at her image. A beat.

Woody glances at him. It's true. Rather than being saddened,

McConnell seems to have taken on new strength. A renewed

sense of wonder.

Woody nods, smiles.

McConnell looks at him.

McConnell nods. Looks again at Maggie's face on the screen.

McConnell nods. They clasp hands briefly. Deal. Then Woody

turns. Before leaving, he hesitates just a moment, turning

back. One last thought, and he doesn't know he's going to

say it until it comes out.

McConnell looks at him, silent but grateful. Woody goes.

McConnell turns back, looking at her smiling face, frozen on

the screen.

INT. COCKPIT. NIGHT

MARS LOOMS AHEAD OF US.

As seen through the cockpit windows. Huge, beautiful, MUCH

CLOSER now. We can make out swirling pink clouds, large

surface features. It's just before Martian dawn, the next

morning.

In the cockpit, Woody and McConnell are in the pilot and co-

pilot's wearing space suits but not yet helmets. AS CAMERA

PULLS BACK AND AWAY, we see them making instrument adjustments

in preparation for MOI.

CAMERA TURNS, PUSHING DOWN INTO...

INT. EVA AIRLOCK. NIGHT

...Where Phil and Terri sit side by side at a pair of

computers, relaying cockpit commands to the systems.

There's a sudden LOUD, BRITTLE POP from somewhere overhead,

and Phil's gloved hand, hovering over a computer screen, is

punctured through and through. The screen itself is holed

and spiderwebbed with a loud CRACK!

PHIL HOLDS UP HIS HAND

As he and Terri stare at it, dumbfounded. Thick droplets of

blood leak out and begin to swirl away, sucked up towards

the venting puncture in the hull over head. The astronauts'

helmets dangle up there, awaiting use.

Suddenly we hear HIGH PITCHED ALARMS SOUNDING, then the

PINGING OF MORE TINY MISSILES, slashing across the ship's

outer skin.

WOODY AND MCCONNELL

Are staring back from the cockpit, reacting in astonishment

to Phil's drifting blood and to the alarms. Then Woody

suddenly understands.

ANGLES ON TERRI AND PHIL

As she seizes his wounded hand, tries to stop the bleeding.

He's staring at a gauge.

ANGLE ON WOODY

As he unbuckles, dives from the cockpit back down into the

EVA, and floats quickly over to a storage hatch. He yanks

this open pulling out a

PATCH GUN

Then spins around in zero-G, as his eyes track

THE RISING DROPLETS OF BLOOD

Which give a telltale hint of the puncture's location,

somewhere up among the dangling helmets on the "ceiling."

WOODY PUSHES OFF

Rising to this area, and shoves aside a helmet with a

shattered faceplate -- its label reads "MCCONNELL" -- to

REVEAL A BREECH IN THE HULL. Jagged metal edges, dangling

insulation. The blood droplets are whirling out through here,

going into the vacuum of space.

Quickly Woody stuffs the muzzle of the patch gun into the

puncture, firing a thick grey sealant. We hear MORE PINGS,

ECHOING LOUDLY, but after a few seconds they DIMINISH, then

abruptly STOP. The KLAXONS continue to wail.

McConnell punches buttons, MUTING THE ALARMS, and they all

strain to listen, faces tense and sweating. A long beat. But

the meteor shower has passed by, as abruptly as it appeared.

The astronauts turn, becoming aware of a strange phenomenon.

PHIL'S BLOOD DROPLETS

Have stopped in place, wobbling eerily as perfect spheres in

the zero-G. Then suddenly they start moving again, faster

and faster, in a new direction. Down through the open core

tunnel that leads to the lower Hab.

MCCONNELL

Stares at a gauge that confirms what's happening.

Just then a computer screen flickers, freezes. Phil punches

keys with his good hand. What he sees shocks him.

Woody looks back at his crew, struggling to project more

calm than he really feels.

They stare at him, stunned by their immense task.

INT. EVA AIRLOCK. MOMENTS LATER

Terri, now helmeted, is putting Woody's helmet on him, but

something's in the way, chafing his neck. He reaches into

his suit, pulls out...

THE CHAIN

From around his neck, with his little Flash Gordon rocketship

dangling.

WOODY HANDS THIS TO TERRI

As they share a brief, loving glance, but there's no time

for words. She tightens his helmet ring, and he brushes his

gloved fingertips on her faceplate. Then he hurries towards

the inner hatch door, where McConnell is throwing airlock

switches. Woody and McConnell exchange a look.

At the EVA computer panel, Phil is shutting down non-essential

power drains, trying to get the main computer system back on

line. His wounded hand makes this difficult and painful.

INT./EXT. AIRLOCK. NIGHT

The outer airlock door is now open, revealing stars, as Woody

drifts through it into space. He's now wearing the MMU, an

oversized jet pack like the ones used by the shuttle

astronauts.

INT. EVA ROOM. NIGHT

MCCONNELL'S HELMET.

With its shattered faceplate -- now useless -- drifts past

Terri as she is wrapping med tape around gauze pads on Phil's

glove.

MCCONNELL

Floats up to them, checking on Phil's work at the computer.

McConnell looks at her, knows she's right. But he starts off

anyway. Phil reaches out his good hand.

This is a radical, incredibly risky notion. McConnell stares

hard at Phil. So does Terri.

McConnell looks from Terri to Phil. It's life and death.

Then he turns, and the CAMERA FOLLOWS MCCONNELL as he pushes

away from the console and dives down into the core tunnel,

heading towards the

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. LOWER HAB

...where he emerges from the core into the rotating Hab deck,

and pushes himself down a ladder toward the floor. He

accelerates as he gets closer to the floor, then rights

himself with a twist and lands on his feet -- now in gravity.

EXT. MARS RECOVERY. NIGHT

Woody, in the MMU, is hovering over the lower segment of the

Hab hull, and right away we see his problem. He can't reach

the damaged spot because it's spinning past him, spewing

vapor.

INT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT

McConnell runs to a computer terminal and starts clicking

with the mouse.

McConnell hears a sound up at the core tunnel. He turns,

it's Terri. She holds an small 0-2 cannister, marked with a

red cross.

McConnell grabs onto a counter edge as...

EXT. SPACE. NIGHT

Attitude control thrusters on the hull begin firing in pulses.

The rotation of the lower Hab deck immediately starts to

slow down. The great red ball of Mars drifts by.

INT. CORE TUNNEL. NIGHT

Terri, lurching, grabs a ladder strut, and watches from the

tunnel as...

MCCONNELL

Is also jarred by the firing of the thrusters. The rotation

slows until the Hab is still. Zero-G. McConnell floats. He

and Terri can hear the terrifying sound of air whistling out

into space through the breach hole.

He starts rooting through Phil's storage area -- bags of

M&Ms, comic books -- looking for what he needs.

INT. COCKPIT. NIGHT

Phil is now strapped into the pilot's seat. He's scared,

sweating hard, but concentrating fiercely as his one good

hand works a battery-powered screwdriver.

He's removing the panel of the main computer bay. Over the

intercom, he can hear the merciless struggle going on

elsewhere.

EXT. SPACE. NIGHT

The lower Hab deck is no longer revolving. Woody pops his

thrusters and drifts over the metallic skin. But there's

such a vast area to search!

INT. LOWER HAB NIGHT

McConnell locates a can of Dr. Pepper, shakes this violently,

then tosses it up to Terri, who's still in the tunnel mouth.

She catches the drifting can, confused. When McConnell speaks

again, he's gasping for air.

Terri shakes out soda from the open can. She and McConnell

watch the brown stream of fluid swirl up into the air, caught

by escaping oxygen. It rises towards the "ceiling" of the

outer hull, like a miniature tornado.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. SPACE. NIGHT

Woody still drifts over the hull, searching intently as his

frustration builds.

INT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT

Terri, staring at the ceiling, sees something remarkable.

THE SODA STREAM

Swirling ever tighter, has formed a whirlpool that's now

being sucked out through the breach hole in the hull. She

can now see the ugly puncture for the first time.

Terri turns, excited by McConnell's triumph; she's just in

time to see him collapse to the floor below her, as he starts

to lose consciousness. He's deathly pale.

EXT. SPACE. NIGHT

Woody spots a tiny geyser of brownish ice crystals spouting

out of the hull of the lower Hab. It's some distance away

from him, but clearly visible.

INT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT

Terri pushes off from the ladder, drifting weightlessly down

to McConnell. She opens the valve of the oxygen cannister,

pushing the plastic mask over McConnell's face. He sucks in

air, color returning to his skin as he revives.

INT. COCKPIT. NIGHT

CLOSE ON THE COMPUTER'S GUTS.

An incredible tangle of tubes, wires, chips, as Phil's gloved

fingers -- both hands now -- probe desperately through them.

PHIL WINCES WITH PAIN.

As he moves his hands and forearms deep inside the computer

bay. Around him, several of the smaller screens and gauges

are starting to malfunction, the data streams breaking apart,

streaking into electronic snow. He shoots a tense glance at

THE NAVIGATIONAL MONITOR

Which is flickering crazily. It shows the ship moving much

closer to its critical MOI point, indicated by a flashing

red triangle aimed down at the Martian surface.

EXT. SPACE. NIGHT

Woody, popping his thrusters, moves as fast as he can towards

the protruding finger of crystal, but he's not there yet.

All of a sudden Woody's thrusters cut out. The ship is moving

by, a meter beneath him. Woody punches his arm controls.

Nothing.

Then just as the outer edge of the hab starts to pass him,

the thrusters kick back in. Woody grabs the edge, starts to

move to the hole. Woody lets out a breath.

INT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT

McConnell, holding his breath, grabs a patch gun from a

storage locker. Terri's still got the 0-2 cannister. He nods

to her, and together they push off from the floor, leaping

weightlessly up to the other side of the Hab, the "ceiling."

They reach the gaping puncture, which they now see has been

only partially dammed by the soda ice.

INT. COCKPIT. NIGHT

VERY CLOSE ON THE COMPUTER'S INTERIOR

As Phil's gloved fingers finally locate the plug he's been

searching for. He hopes. And grip it firmly.

PHIL TAKES A DEEP BREATH.

Says a silent prayer. Then he yanks the plug. SHRILL WHINES,

ELECTRONIC CRACKLES from all around him, as the systems are

abruptly shut down, in a way they were never meant to be

mishandled. Terrifyingly, a couple of the monitors arc to

each other as they die. Dodging sparks, Phil stares at

THE NAVIGATIONAL MONITOR

As it also flickers and dies. Now they're flying blind.

EXT. SPACE. NIGHT

Woody arrives at the ice finger, knocks away the big crystal,

then pulls his patch equipment from a pouch.

INT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT

In the Hab, Terri uses the base of the 0-2 cannister to smash

away the interior ice chunk, then McConnell, who's getting

wobbly again, blasts the hole with the epoxy gun. As he works,

Terri gives him another hit of air.

The lights flicker out in the Hab.

EXT. SPACE. NIGHT

Outside, Woody slaps a big square patch over the hole, rips

off the backing.

CLOSE ON THE PATCH

As it changes color and shrinks, drawing itself down into

the metal of the hull.

INT. COCKPIT. NIGHT

VERY CLOSE ON THE COMPUTER'S INTERIOR.

As Phil's fingers re-connect the same plug.

PHIL PULLS HIS HAND OUT

From inside the computer bay. He's trembling, sweat-streaked

inside his faceplate. Blood has soaked through his gauze

pads. His good hand hovers over the red main power switch.

The moment of truth.

With a dramatic click, he throws the switch, hard-booting

the computer system back on. He stares at the screens.

Nothing happens!

Frightened, furious, Phil bangs on the switch with his

cordless screwdriver. When all else fails, hit something.

INT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT

Feeble starlight from the viewports. McConnell and Terri,

drifting side by side, stare at one another, expecting to

die within seconds. It feels like an agonizing eternity.

McConnell's eyes widen, as he realizes this is the same as

the last reading.

Terri and McConnell look at each other. Tears of relief in

her eyes. He is exhausted, nearly spent, but manages a grin.

She holds the 0-2 mask up to his face, and as he grips it,

breathing deeply, they hug one another.

INT. COCKPIT. NIGHT

The lights and computer screens are flickering back on. All

of them! The cockpit lights up like a Christmas tree. Phil

bounces up and down like a madman, babbling in triumph.

Forgetting his injury, he pounds his gloved fist on the

console in triumph.

He wrings his injured hand, then his gaze is caught by

THE NAVIGATIONAL MONITOR

Which pops back on, showing the ship and the MOI point coming

perilously close together.

PHIL'S EYES WIDEN IN FEAR

As he keys his mike urgently.

EXT. SPACE. NIGHT

Woody floats above the repaired hole, scanning the nearby

surface of the hull.

Woody jets back towards the open EVA hatch. But as he reaches

this, about to re-enter the ship, he's captured momentarily

by a breathtakingly beautiful sight below him.

SUNRISE OVER MARS

As the huge planet is REVEALED in all its red, unearthly

glory. It's so close now that individual features can be

seen with the naked eye -- the vast chasm of Valles Marineris,

and then Olympus Mons, poking all the way up through the

Martian atmosphere. A stunning, alluring spectacle.

WOODY

Stares down at Mars, enthralled, as sunlight floods the side

of the spaceship, sparkles off his visor. Dawn, after a very

long night indeed. He whispers lovingly, under his breath.

Then he stirs himself out of his reverie and hurries through

the EVA hatch.

CAMERA DRIFTS QUICKLY BACK and down along the hull as stark

sunlight flares off the big propellant tanks, three in a

row, and the thick silver tubes that join them. There's a

good deal of scarring and denting from the meteor shower.

Then, as the ship begins to MOVE OUT OF FRAME...

WE MOVE IN CLOSER

On one of these tubes, a feeder line to the engine bells, we

see a scatter of tiny, undetected holes, about the size of

the eraser at the end of a pencil. So small, so apparently

harmless...

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY

As Woody enters, stripped from the MMU, dripping with sweat,

McConnell is waiting for him. For a moment the two men just

look at each other, then they surge forward into a fierce

hug.

McConnell looks at him, understands.

Terri sits nearby, where she has just finished stitching up

Phil's hand. As Woody goes to her, she rises from her seat

and looks at him tears of relief and pride in her eyes.

He scoops her into his arms; they kiss passionately.

Phil is blinking; something seems to be getting into his own

eyes. His voice catches for a moment.

Terri separates from Woody, looks down at Phil.

Phil starts curling up his fingers. The middle digit remains

extended in the universal gesture. They all consider this

for a moment. Then Phil looks up cheerfully.

After a split-second they get it, and the whole crew roars

with LAUGHTER, which builds and builds; they're almost giddy

with the relief of the tension...

EXT. DEEP SPACE. DAY

MARS RECOVERY

Sails INTO VIEW, with small attitude thrusters firing as the

great ship maneuvers into position for its orbital-capture

burn. Mars looks very large, blood-red. The entire spectacle

is majestic, awe-inspiring.

INT. COCKPIT. DAY

All four astronauts are strapped in, fully suited and

helmeted. Mars looms through the cockpit windows. The

atmosphere is electric with excitement.

He flips three switches, in rapid sequence, and...

EXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY

As we MOVE IN on the damaged fuel line, we see a tiny but

steady spray of fuel venting from the hole caused by the

meterorite. This freezes into eerie streamers and chunks,

which slowly drift away from the ship. They're quite

beautiful.

INT. COCKPIT. DAY

Woody looks at the others for moment -- everyone is set,

looking good -- then reaches for a last switch.

Woody hesitates, then glances at McConnell.

McConnell, moved by this honor, nods. He reaches out to throw

the switch himself.

As the countdown indicator reaches "0000.00.00", a final

signal PINGS, and he flips the switch.

EXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY

In total silence, the engines ignite. The second they do,

the streamers of frozen fuel explode in a white flash.

INT. COCKPIT. DAY

With alarms sounding, the four astronauts are slammed

violently forward, against their restraints.

He and Woody both reach out, straining against the incredible

G-forces, and manage to grab a red emergency lever, yanking

it down hard.

EXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY

Too late! IN SLOW MOTION, we see a terrifyingly violent chain

reaction. The fuel tanks themselves explode, one after

another. The supporting metal struts are vaporized. The solar

panels are snapped off. Two of the huge engine bells are

smashed sideways, out of alignment, while the third, trailing

pieces of the cowling, goes hurtling off, PAST CAMERA, like

a flaming cannon ball. The entire aft section of the ship,

including much of the lower Hab, instantly becomes a shredded,

charred tangle of metal, and even worse, the explosion causes

what's left of the ship -- mainly the EVA chamber and cockpit --

to tumble end over end, cartwheeling down towards Mars.

INT. COCKPIT. DAY

In the windows, Mars goes crazily in and out of view. The

astronauts, flung this way, then that, are all fighting

against unconsciousness.

EXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY

From further away, the charred remainder of the ship can be

seen spinning down towards Mars, which now fills the screen,

looming as large as Earth, when seen from the space shuttle.

The ship's motion is mercifully slowing as it hits the outer

atmosphere, but just as clearly this steep, unplanned angle

of entry dooms it.

INT. COCKPIT. DAY

ON A COMPUTER.

Their ANGLE OF ENTRY is shown -- much too direct -- with an

indicated swerve into blinking red disaster. Warnings flash:

CRITICAL ENTRY! PULL OUT!

McConnell's mind is racing furiously, desperately.

Phil punches buttons. ON THE SCREEN a second ellipse appears:

a blinking orange dot labelled "REMO." It appears to be soon

intersecting with their own trajectory.

Phil frantically types in commands on the computer.

They look at him, stunned. Leave the ship?

They stare at Woody. We feel the full, terrible weight of

his responsibility. Four lives hang on his call.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. SPACE. DAY

The astronauts are outside the ship, tethered to each other

with long shock cords. Other cords, clipped to their suits,

trail gear bags. Phil clutches a silver metallic case -- his

precious computer repair kit. Woody is in the MMU. They're

all rotating at the same speed as the ship behind them.

All four astronauts fire a brief, simultaneous burst from

the tiny attitude control thrusters in their suits. This

stops their rotation, bringing their travel under control.

The ship continues spinning in the background.

Woody takes a final look at the charred, doomed Mars Recovery.

The only home they've known for six months. He exchanges a

silent glance with the others. They all expect to be dead in

the next few minutes. Woody takes a breath, nods.

He pops the big thrusters on the MMU and starts heading away

from the ship. The cord between Woody and the others pulls

taut and they start to follow.

WIDE SHOT

Of Woody leading them away from the crippled spaceship,

against the magnificent backdrop of the blood-red planet

below. Four tiny figures, all alone in space.

ANGLE ON MCCONNELL AND THE OTHERS

As Phil looks back, his eyes searching the stars.

He tries to smile. So does she.

Woody eyes a small display screen on his forearm.

THEIR POV

Everyone is looking back at the curve of Mars against black

space, expecting to see the REMO coming up behind them.

TERRI

Happens to glance directly below.

THEIR POV

The black outline of the little cargo craft drifts against

the red of Mars.

WOODY

Looks again at his display screen, frustrated.

From a compartment on the side of the MMU, Woody pulls out...

THE TETHER GUN

About the size of a large flare gun. There's a carabiner-

like hook five inches in diameter on the front of the gun.

McConnell looks at him. They both know how risky this is,

and they also know it's their only chance. Woody flips a

switch on the gun and pulls on the hook. Off it comes,

trailing wire. Woody clips the hook to the MMU, then hands

McConnell the gun.

McConnell nods. Woody and Terri exchange a look -- tender,

loving -- then Woody turns around and fires the MMU jets at

full throttle. As Woody pulls away, line unspools from the

tether gun.

WOODY AND THE REMO

Woody is chasing the REMO from above. It's as if he were in

an airplane, trying to land on a car racing along a freeway.

Woody is picking up speed quickly. Maybe too quickly. He

checks his armpad display screen.

Woody starts braking with the MMU thrusters as hard as he

can.

CLOSE ON THE THRUSTERS

Glowing with orange flame. They suddenly cut off.

WOODY'S EYES

Show alarm. He checks his display.

Woody hits some buttons and the MMU's latches snap open. He

grabs the hook connected to the tether line, then pushes

himself free of the MMU, starts firing his small suit jets.

WOODY'S POV

He's still going very quickly.

WITH MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL

Floating close together. The tether line is still unspooling

from the gun. They watch Woody, below and ahead of them, as

he races towards the REMO. Terri's heart is in her throat.

McConnell reaches a glove out, touching her arm.

BACK ON WOODY

Still speeding towards the REMO. His suit jets cut out.

MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL

Stare at Woody's distant figure.

INTERCUT --

A look between McConnell and Terri; her face is stricken.

WOODY AND THE REMO

Woody's coming down on the module at over thirty kilometers

an hour. He holds the hook out in front of him with one hand

while grabbing the tether line with the other, and WHAM! --

he crashes into the REMO.

WOODY'S HAND

Slams the hook against a receiver on the hull of the REMO.

IT CONNECTS --

WOODY

Tries to hold onto the tether line but his momentum is too

much.

HIS GLOVED HANDS

Are ripped from the line.

WOODY

Slides over the hull of the REMO.

HIS HANDS

Grasp in vain for something to grab onto. They drag and bump

and then finally his fingers close on... empty space.

WOODY

Is past the REMO, freefalling toward Mars.

BACK ON MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL

As Terri screams.

McConnell hits a button on the tether gun and starts to reel

them quickly in towards the REMO.

WOODY

Tries his suit jets again -- they're empty.

HIS POV

Falling away from the REMO.

MCCONNELL AND THE OTHERS

Are being reeled towards the REMO by the tether line. Another

couple hundred meters to go.

INTERCUTTING --

McConnell and Terri share a quick, anguished look.

McConnell finishes looking over the numbers on his display

pad. Terri is staring at him. When McConnell's eyes meet

hers, they are red-rimmed. Haunted.

Phil points. McConnell and Terri look.

THE MARS RECOVERY COCKPIT

Is now several kilometers below and behind them. It's glowing

red... then orange... then white. Then it erupts into a giant

fireball, devoured by friction with Mars' atmosphere.

MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL IN DEEP SPACE

Are all staring at this, awed, when McConnell happens to

look up again. He sees something alarming.

THEIR POV

They are drifting quickly into the REMO.

ALL THREE

Fire their suit jets, slowing themselves down. They bang

into the REMO at about one-tenth the speed Woody did. They

find handholds and grab on. McConnell hits a button on the

tether gun.

THE HOOK

Releases from the REMO's hull. McConnell hits another button

and it is reeled all the way into the gun. Phil is already

scrabbling at a latch on the REMO's outer airlock door.

WOODY

Is looking back at the REMO. Smiles with relief to see that

Terri has reached it safely.

He turns to look at...

MARS

Right below him, filling his field of view. A long beat.

BACK AT THE REMO

Terri makes a snap decision. She grabs the tether gun from

McConnell's surprised hands, then pushes off from the REMO.

McConnell lunges after her, his gloved hand straining.

But it's too late. She's already out of reach, and now fires

her suit jets, pulling quickly away from the REMO.

MCCONNELL

Is reaching to activate his own jets, when

PHIL'S HAND

Grabs at his wrist, restraining this suicidal courage. They

stare at each other. McConnell wrenches his hand free, half-

maddened, agonized, staring after Terri.

But Terri keeps on going.

WOODY

Looks back at the REMO, as he continues to fall towards Mars.

Sees the small figure of his wife heading towards him.

INTERCUT --

AT THE REMO

Phil is watching as Terri drops towards the distant twinkle

of Woody's suit lights. The airlock door hangs open. Phil

looks at McConnell, anguished.

INTERCUTTING BETWEEN WOODY AND TERRI

As Woody keys his mike. Tries to steady his voice.

No response from Terri.

Terri looks at her armpad display.

CLOSE ON DISPLAY SCREEN

As her fuel indicator drops from 50 percent to 49 to...

TERRI

Releases her thumb from the toggle control.

HER SUIT JETS

Stop firing.

TERRI

Drifts, staring towards Woody.

TERRI AND WOODY

Are on the same trajectory, going the same speed, and only

about a hundred meters apart. But it might as well be

infinity.

Terri raises up the tether gun and pulls the trigger.

THE HOOK

Comes shooting out of the gun, wire spooling out behind it.

WOODY

Watches as it comes shooting down toward him.

PLATE POV -- MOVING -- AS

Woody gets larger and larger, the hook gets closer and closer,

and then SNAP! -- the hook stops. ANGLE ON THE TETHER GUN

The wire has run all the way out.

WOODY

Looks at the drifting hook, ten agonizing meters away from

him. His only life preserver.

TERRI

Hits the button and the wire starts winching fast back into

the gun.

No response from Terri.

THE HOOK

Is whipping back toward Terri and the gun. Woody's voice

cracks; he's very close to tears. Pleading now.

The hook slams back against the muzzle of the gun. Terri

resets the gun quickly, in an anguished fury.

TERRI

Looks at Woody, two hundred meters away, sensing something

different in his voice now, a terrible resolve...

WOODY

Raises his hands to his helmet ring. His eyes shining.

He unscrews the ring, pops the seal. The outrush of air pushes

his helmet all the way off. Woody shuts his eyes and opens

his mouth.

Ice crystals bloom with Woody's last breath. There's nothing

to suck in. He doesn't fight it. He lets death come.

ANGLE ON TERRI

Tears streaming, chest heaving, frantic.

HER THUMB

Hovers over her suit jet toggle control. McConnell's voice,

from the distance, sounds very tired. Like he's aged fifty

years in the blink of an eye.

Terri's thumb is still poised. Death would be better.

ANGLE ON MCCONNELL

Outside the REMO. The hatch is still open. We see Phil inside,

staring out anxiously towards Terri.

He sees no movement from the distant, small figure of Terri.

TERRI'S THUMB

Pushes the toggle control... to one side, not forward.

TERRI'S FACE

Inside her helmet, is streaming with tears. She turns herself

around, reluctantly. Heads slowly back towards the REMO.

INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY

On the big screen at MMCR, a glowing green icon labelled

"MARS RECOVERY" is shown in orbit, as a stream of computer

figures crawls beside it.

SUPER TITLE: "SPACE STATION. MMCR. 20 MINUTE TIME LAG"

Beck stands by the NEW CAPCOM, as the latter repeats headset

data.

Suddenly the data stream goes crazy. It shivers, streaks,

breaks up... then stops. The blinking green icon representing

Mars Recovery glows brighter... then vanishes.

A moment of stunned silence in the big room. Then a rising

babble of scared, confused voices.

RAY BECK

Takes a step forward, staring helplessly at the screen. His

face goes pale, stricken. His worst nightmare is taking place,

right before his eyes -- and for the second mission in a

row...

EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT

The REMO is now on the night side of Mars. Cargo boxes,

packing cases and assorted equipment containers float outside.

The hatch is sealed.

INT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT

McConnell hovers by a bulkhead. He's anguished, haunted by

the image of Woody's death. We see him struggling to overcome

his grief and shock, trying to force himself to concentrate

on the critical tasks at hand. In front of him, a panel has

been opened; he's facing

SMALL UTILITY MONITOR

Already glowing, surrounded by coded switches, indicator

lights, com ports.

MCCONNELL

Stares at these, thinking hard, remembering. He's holding a

palm-sized computer, already wired into this panel. He begins

tapping the keys, but then stops himself. Reconsiders. He

turns, looking back at

TERRI AND PHIL

Hunched on what would be the floor if the REMO were on land.

They grip stowage straps to keep from drifting. Clearly this

tiny, rude cargo craft was never designed for manned

operation. It's claustrophobic, bitterly cold.

PHIL'S FACE

Is a map of torment. He is shivering, both from cold and

fear, barely holding himself together. He hugs his computer

supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear.

TERRI

Is worse. A thousand-yard stare. She's in shock.

MCCONNELL

Knows he has to occupy them. Speaks softly.

Phil looks up at him dully.

After a moment Phil releases his strap, pushes towards

McConnell. He stares numbly at the monitor for a few beats,

then takes the little computer from McConnell. He begins to

tap the keys, slowly at first, but then with more confidence.

Terri hesitates a moment, then looks at the strap in her

hand, as if she's never seen it before. Dully she reaches

for another one, begins looping them together.

MCCONNELL

Studies both of their faces intently. Knows that he can't

push them too hard, too fast. They're moving like robots,

but at least they're moving.

EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT. (MINUTES LATER)

Small thrusters are firing, getting the REMO into position

for entry into the atmosphere.

Then all the jets fire in unison, braking the REMO, as it

falls away from us, towards Mars at night.

INT. REMO. HIGH ATMOSPHERE. NIGHT

The astronauts, restrained on the floor by Terri's jury-rigged

strap system, hold on for dear life. The buffeting through

the atmosphere is shaking them violently.

BEHIND THEIR FACEPLATES

We see the effect of the incredible g-forces: faces distorted,

unable to focus their eyes. Each of them thinking, once again:

Now I'm going to die...

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. NIGHT

The Mars One Base Camp looms in the foreground, like some

desolate, otherwordly ghost town. And then, in the night sky

beyond it, we see an eerie and beautiful sight: a bright

streak of red as the REMO slashes down into the Martian

atmosphere, like a shooting star, finally disappearing behind

distant mountains. Then all is stillness again, deathly

stillness and silence...

INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. VIEWPORT. DAY

Beck stands by a viewport, staring out into space. He's just

lost four good friends, and also knows he is seeing, in this

disaster, the probable end of the Mars Program, and the

certain end of his own career. He doesn't, at first, even

hear the nearby VOICE.

Beck looks up, his eyes red-rimmed. The CapCom shifts

uneasily. He's holding a computer printout.

Beck snatches the paper, staring at it. For the first time

we see some life coming back into him.

Beck suddenly understands. And it's a joy to see his face,

the tears of happiness that spring into his eyes.

The CapCom stares back at him, feeling the same surge of

hope.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. MARTIAN SURFACE. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY

POV ANGLE - WIDE

As we see the Mars One Base Camp: silent, very still. In the

distance, the massive ERV still looms, perched for takeoff,

the bottom rungs of its ladder buried.

PANNING

We see that sand has drifted high against the Hab, as well

as the sides of the partially-deflated tunnel and greenhouse,

and the four-man rover. The oxygen still and propellant plant

are almost buried. Solar panels, some of them punctured by

micrometeors, FLAP and CREAK eerily in the slight breeze.

And finally,

CLOSER TO CAMERA

We see the camp's American flag, still on its toppled pole,

but nearly obliterated by sand.

ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, TERRI, AND PHIL

Who are spooked by this desolation. They've paused at the

edge of the camp.

They have dragged along with them from their landing site a

crude sledge, improvised from the REMO's hatch cover and

some cargo straps. On this, their meager supplies.

McConnell, glancing at the others, knows he's got to keep

their spirits up. He kneels, digs out the flag pole. Brushing

off the sand, he rights this and re-plants it firmly in the

ground, packing the sand down with his boot. He stands for a

moment looking at the flag, his eyes moist. Despite the cost,

they have made it to Mars.

When he turns, Terri and Phil are looking at him, moved.

He catches himself. Phil and Terri look at him.

EXT. ERV. DAY

Phil steps from the umber sand onto the ERV's ladder, begins

to climb. The four-man rover is nearby, sand drifted high

against its tires.

EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

Terri kneels by the oxygen still, begins to scoop away sand

with her gloved hands. She still looks numb.

EXT. HAB. DAY

He unlatches a panel, grips the emergency lever inside, tugs

it. After a seeming eternity, the door groans and creaks

open. Little puffs of dust and sand swirl about, settle.

EXT. ERV. DAY

Perched atop the ERV's ladder, Phil, using a battery-powered

drill, is just removing the final screw from the hatch cover.

He lifts off the heavy cover, lets it tumble to the sand.

EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

Terri is still scooping sand. She's just cleared the first

row of gauges.

INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

McConnell walks through the kitchen, which we recognize. He

pauses to look at the table from which Luke and his crew

taped their final, fateful message.

HIS BIRTHDAY CUPCAKE

Still sits there, eerily, with its stub of burned-out candle.

Half-finished, frozen cups of coffee. Suddenly, out of the

corner of his eye, he catches a flash of white. He spins,

startled, and sees

HIS OWN REFLECTION.

In his white pressure suit, staring back at him from the

screen of a video monitor. Above this is perched the camera

the Mars One astronauts used for their comm packets.

MCCONNELL SHIVERS

This place is filled with ghosts.

INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY

Phil, in the pilot's seat of the ERV, pushes a computer's

power button. The screen flickers weakly to life, startling

him a bit, but all he sees on it are white streaks, crazy

static.

EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

Terri has cleared more gauges, valves. She sits back on her

heels, studying the tangle of pipes.

INT. GREENHOUSE. DAY

AN INNER AIRLOCK DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN, AND MCCONNELL ENTERS.

THEN STOPS, ASTONISHED. HIS POV

On a fantastic, almost jungle-like atmosphere. The plants

have been allowed -- encouraged? -- to grow wildly. Some are

even pushing against the inflated roof. Water condenses on

the leaves and the roof, then is captured and routed through

pipes of every shape and size, dripping into a clever

assortment of collection jars. Liquid water.

MCCONNELL

Reaches into a bucket, touches the water. His glove comes up

before his wondering eyes, dripping. Grasping the implication,

he looks down at his forearm instrument pad.

Blinking red letters read "25 deg. C." And something else --

the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly

deflate, revealing his arm's shape. There's air pressure in

here!

MCCONNELL

Punches in more numbers, and gets the readout:

"Nitr. 78%/ 02 20%/ C02 1%/ Trace gasses 1%."

MCCONNELL

Slowly reaches up, unsealing the neck ring of his helmet. He

hesitates, then lifts it off. Takes a deep, quenching lungful

of pure air. Holds it in. Lets it slowly out. For a moment

he doesn't trust his own voice. Then speaks softly towards

his helmet.

INT. ERV. DAY

Phil, still sitting at the cockpit controls, turns. Through

a side viewport he can just make out the greenhouse.

There's no answer. He rises.

EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

Terri rises, concerned, and turns. Through the distant,

translucent wall of the greenhouse, McConnell's shadowy figure

can be seen, moving slowly.

INT. GREENHOUSE. DAY

McConnell sets down his helmet, starts exploring, pushing

through fronds as he makes his way down an aisle. The dripping

foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path. Everywhere he

looks, he has the sense of a scrounged-together, recycled,

jury-rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has

come into play. He pauses, looking up...

Overhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic

tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in

the upper deck of the Hab. Its power comes from a crude water

wheel, a buckets-and-strut assemblage, tidily sutured with

duct tape, like some giant Erector set.

As McConnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged

figure leaps through the foliage! It smashes into him, with

a HARSH SCREECH, knocking him to the ground.

McConnell, on his back, straddled by his attacker, fights

back as best he can. A blur of flailing arms and fists, as

he tries to push the creature away. Staring up, he catches a

glimpse of the almost unrecognizable

LUKE GRAHAM

Whose frightened eyes glare back at him through a swaying

curtain of dreadlocks. His skin is creased, weathered, above

a scraggly beard. His clothes are tattered, patched together.

In one fist he grips a rock hammer, which he swings high

overhead, about to drive the claw through McConnell's skull.

McConnell grabs his arm desperately, trying to fend him off.

We see a flash of uncertainty in Luke's eyes. Then he yanks

his arm free, and his hammer arcs up even higher, trembles

in the air.

As he stares down at McConnell, Luke's eyes finally light up

with recognition. but before he can move, he is seized from

behind and flung backwards to the ground, the hammer ripped

from his grasp, as Terri and Phil pinion his arms. McConnell

scrambles to his feet.

McConnell kneels beside Luke, signalling to Terri and Phil

that it's okay to let him go. They stand back, pulling off

their helmets. Everyone is panting, out of breath.

Luke sits up, slowly studying their features, one after

another, as if still not quite certain whether they might

vanish. His voice is hoarse, rusty from disuse.

Luke looks with incomprehension at McConnell.

Luke stares at McConnell, trying to absorb everything. He

looks to Terri, who looks down.

Luke shakes his head in dismay. He seems to shrink in on

himself. It's all too much for him to take in. McConnell

kneels and puts his arm around Luke, comforting him.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. ELSEWHERE IN THE GREENHOUSE. DAY (MINUTES LATER)

Luke sits on the side of his cot, in the little tented

sleeping area he's created in one corner of the greenhouse.

Nearby, his hotplate, pots, and some freshly harvested

vegetables and greens. The others crouch around him.

A flash of fear in Luke's eyes.

His voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper.

He taps his forehead, significantly, then nods once or twice.

The others exchange an uneasy glance.

He rises quickly and scuttles off, waving an impatient hand,

without waiting to see if they'll follow. McConnell, Terri

and Phil stare after him for a long moment. Phil breaks the

silence.

McConnell and Terri follow in the direction Luke went. Phil,

trailing, mutters to himself.

EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY

Luke, now in a patched-up pressure suit and grubby-looking

helmet, stands peering down unhappily at the improvised

sledge, with its meager supplies. McConnell, Terri, and Phil

walk up behind him, wearing their helmets again. They hear

Luke over his RADIO.

McConnell and the others are silent, embarrassed. Then

McConnell nods. Luke looks at him, a cracked grin.

He points to the computer repair case, as Phil lifts it off

a sledge. Luke turns, looks at the case, then Phil.

In some mysterious way, this reminder of Woody's death seems

to bring him fully back into himself. He takes Terri by the

shoulders, deeply saddened. She meets his gaze.

She nods, grateful. A beat. He looks at the others.

He starts off across the sand, and they follow.

EXT. GRAVE SITE. DAY

They stand looking down at the three long mounds of dirt, as

Luke completes his account of the disaster.

He has to pause, collect himself.

There is an emotional silence. Luke turns, takes a few steps.

He stares into the distance, observing the swirling dust

around them. McConnell hesitates, notices Luke's gaze.

Luke looks off into the distance, studies something only he

seems to see.

McConnell pulls his gaze away from the horizon, looks at

Luke.

McConnell isn't quite sure how to reply to this.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

McConnell, Terri, and Phil follow Luke into the Science Lab

area of the Hab, then stop in their tracks. Their helmets

are off. It's very cold in here; their breath is frosty.

THEIR POV --

The Lab is crammed with rock and sand samples from many

locations, all tagged and labelled. There are drawings and

diagrams covering the walls: Martian landscapes, annotated

maps, and over and over, obsessively repeated, drawings of

the vortex that destroyed the Mars One crew.

The others turn, looking at him. Luke is aiming an electric

space heater at his computer. As the coils glow red, he rubs

his hands together, poised over the keyboard.

Luke reacts to their blank stares. He has a kind of jittery

feverish intensity, a secret excitement.

The others exchange worried glances. Is he totally nuts?

On the computer screen they're looking at...

CLOSE ON THE MONITOR

Pictures of the Face after the disaster, seen from ground-

level, in telephoto views. Rising out of a ring of rock and

dirt rubble is the shiny-white profile of a gigantic face.

The white is smooth, impenetrable. It has the scale of a

mountain, but the planes and angles are clearly unnatural.

MCCONNELL, PHIL AND TERRI (INT. MARS ONE HAB.)

They are stunned. Can hardly believe their eyes.

A few moments of silence while they try to absorb this.

A click of the mouse and they all HEAR, over speakers, the

DEEP PULSING BASS TONE.

Luke is trembling with excitement. His words tumble out very

quickly. He's been waiting so long to share this.

He types another command. They all look at the monitor, the

glow reflecting on their faces. They are amazed again.

CLOSE ON THE MONITOR

Where we see the beautiful interlocking chain, the universally

familiar double helix, of a DNA molecule -- the elegant

blueprint of life.

BACK TO SCENE (INT. MARS ONE HAB.)

She glances at him, surprised that he overheard her earlier

diagnosis. But he smiles, not offended.

They look at him. Then all four turn, stare again at the

slowly rotating DNA, pondering its awesome mystery.

MCCONNELL

When he finally speaks, never takes his eyes off the screen.

We can read in them the almost overwhelming grip this mystery

has on his imagination.

The others nod in weary agreement. As they start out, towards

the relative warmth of the greenhouse, Terri looks at Luke,

at his scraggly beard and his long, lank hair. She smiles,

brushing some locks off his forehead.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. MARS ONE HAB. ANOTHER SECTION. NEXT MORNING

As in the Science Area, this space has enough thin oxygen

for the astronauts to remain unhelmeted. McConnell and Luke

are still going through what few supplies were salvaged from

the REMO.

Luke pauses, rubbing the unfamiliar smoothness of his cheek.

His beard is gone, his hair neatly trimmed. McConnell enjoys

Luke's own wonder at his transformation.

McConnell smiles. Terri enters through the hatch, removing

her helmet.

McConnell, rummaging through Phil's backpack, drops an already-

opened bag of M&Ms. The CANDIES scatter and bounce all over

the floor.

Luke and Terri smile. McConnell scoops up the fallen M&Ms.

He slows down as he does it, looking at the scatter of little

round CANDIES. Something tugging at the back of his mind...

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. MARS RECOVERY. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY

Phil's intricately designed M&M model of his "ideal woman",

floating weightlessly, as McConnell drifts past it, plucking

away a couple pieces of the candy. Phil reacting, in good-

natured annoyance. The gap in the design left by McConnell's

theft...

INT. MARS ONE HAB. ANOTHER SECTION. DAY

CLOSE ON MCCONNELL

As he trembles with excitement. With sudden comprehension.

Luke and Terri stare at him.

INT. MARS ONE HAB. MOMENTS LATER

McConnell sits in front of the computer back in the science

lab area, staring once again at the mysterious DNA model.

Luke and Terri stand behind him. McConnell's energy, his new

certainty, is almost electrifying.

Terri and Luke look at each other, starting to understand.

INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY

Phil is listening in on radio. He's got panels open, wires

dangling, as he works his ongoing repair. He keys his mike,

uneasily.

INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

As McConnell looks at Luke and Terri.

Luke stares at him, startled by what he's implying.

INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY

Phil is also growing increasingly nervous.

INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

As Luke and Terri look tensely at McConnell.

McConnell looks at her.

Terri shakes her head.

His passion startles them; they've never seen him so

emotional. He points at the computer screen.

They look at him, surprised.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

The familiar, plucky little figure of ARES-8 wheels across

ocher sand, with the radar gun jury-rigged onto its back.

Ares' video snout WHIRRS out, extending. The familiar bass

rumble of the Face is very loud from here.

INT. MARS ONE HAB. LATE DAY

McConnell, Terri, and Phil have gathered around Luke as he

pushes buttons, and a monitor CRACKLES to life. White streaks,

then a blurry image, which he tries to enhance. Finally the

image starts to sharpen.

ON THE MONITOR

They see the familiar stark white profile of the FACE, shot

from ground level, in a SLOWLY APPROACHING ANGLE...

THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS

Stare at the ominous sight. They're all more nervous than

they want to show. Luke's fingers delicately work a joystick

as he maneuvers the remote surveyor.

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY

Ares-8 whines to a stop by a large boulder, which partially

shields it from the Face, looming beyond. The radar gun

swivels, locating its target. Then stops, ready to fire.

INT. MARS ONE HAB. LATE DAY

Luke looks at Terri, Phil, and McConnell. Phil shuts the lid

of the box holding the new nav boards, snaps it protectively

down. He nods. Terri takes a deep breath, then she nods.

Luke's hand hovers over the red firing button; a moment of

awesome uncertainty and danger. He looks at McConnell, who

finally gives a nod of command. Then Luke hits the button.

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY

From the radar gun on Ares-8's back, a sharp, high-pitched

electronic burst is emitted, pulsating like a tuning fork as

it's fired towards the Face. After a few seconds it stops.

For a moment nothing happens.

Then the deep bass rumbling stops as well. The only remaining

sound is of WIND, stirring up dust on the Martian plains.

ANGLE ON THE FACE

As suddenly a huge, curved segment of the white surface begins

to rise from the earth, like a gigantic hangar door, sliding

out of sight into an upper sheath of some kind. The movement

is measured, stately, utterly silent. As the segment rises,

it reveals a blinding white light: the interior of the Face.

No inside details can be seen.

INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

McConnell, Luke, Terri and Phil stare at this phenomenon,

awed. They're barely breathing.

Luke punches buttons, waits anxiously for a readout.

McConnell is staring at the mysterious opening. On his face,

a growing look of determination.

The others look at him, their expressions changing as they

realize what he's implying.

EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. LATE DAY

McConnell, once again helmeted, emerges from the Hab airlock.

Luke, Terri and Phil are coming out behind him. The wind has

picked up, and fine dust is blowing. They stop, staring off

in astonishment towards

A FRIGHTENING SIGHT

The entire sky has darkened from its customary salmon into

purplish-black at the horizon, with bloody streaks above.

The DUST STORM has turned their way; it's now sixty kilometers

away and closing. The main body of it reaches two thousand

meters above the surface and stretches out along a thousand-

kilometer front.

THE ASTRONAUTS

Stare at this unholy juggernaut, alarmed. McConnell turns to

Luke, whose expression is grim.

McConnell stares at him.

McConnell turns, staring off towards the killer storm. The

others look at him with questioning gazes. He turns again.

There's the four-man rover, ready to go. Waiting.

He looks a question at Luke and Terri, one after the other.

Their eyes, tense but excited, signal agreement.

McConnell nods, satisfied. Looks at Terri and Luke.

They start towards the four-man rover. Dust is swirling more

thickly through the air, and the WIND IS LOUDER NOW. Phil

stands watching them go, a lone, rather forlorn figure.

EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DUSK

In a WIDE SHOT, we see the rover approaching the Face, across

the plains. The sky beyond the Face is almost black, as the

storm approaches from that direction. It's marching

relentlessly across the planet, with flashes of lightning

now rippling up and down its face, and even small tornadoes

spinning off near its purple-black base...

INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK

Phil has panels off. He's reaching into the guts of the main

computer, working feverishly. His repair kit is beside him.

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. DUSK

In a HIGH SHOT, we look down across the side of the Face and

its vast, open doorway, out of which the bright white light

is streaming. Into this corridor of light, we see the rover

arrive, slewing to a stop, throwing sand from its wheels.

GROUND LEVEL SHOT

Looking at the cavernous vertical gap in the side of the

Face. The opening towers to a dizzying height above us; the

white light strains our eyes. The three astronauts ENTER

FRAME as we see them, from behind, staring up.

ON THE ASTRONAUTS' AWED FACES

As they are stunned by the immensity of the scene, the cosmic

mystery before them. Luke and Terri look at McConnell. Another

moment of critical decision. He keys his mike.

INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK

Phil keys his own mike.

EXT. THE FACE. DUSK

McConnell stares into the bright opening. Bathed in its light.

Terri and Luke exchange a tense glance.

Luke smiles. The three of them stare into the portal.

McConnell, between the others, reaches out and grips each of

them by a gloved hand. They take a sort of collective breath.

Then they walk forward together, into the light.

INT. THE FACE. DUSK

The astronauts continue forward, each of them extending a

free hand.

The light is too dazzling for them to gauge distances,

textures, colors -- anything at all. They can't see walls,

ceiling, even a floor.

Behind them, there is an abrupt WHOOOSH, like a giant airlock

sealing shut. They turn, startled and nervous. Letting go of

each other's hands, Luke and Terri run back the way they

came, but almost immediately are stopped by a wall of some

sort. The vast hangar-type door has closed behind them.

The three scared, helmeted faces seem to float in the

brightness, some twenty feet apart.

INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK

Phil, saying a silent prayer, reaches over and turns on the

main computer. It works! He's immensely relieved.

He glances out the cockpit window at the blowing dust. Then

realizes that he's hearing only silence over his radio.

No answer. Phil stares at his radio in dread.

INT. FACE. DUSK

McConnell is staring at his spacesuit's sleeve. He can see

that the suit material is starting to deflate, revealing the

shape of his arm, just as it did in Luke's greenhouse. He

hesitates, then begins to unscrew the sealing ring on his

right glove.

Terri and Luke see this.

McConnell makes the final twist on his glove and there's the

hiss of rushing air.

Luke looks at his sleeve. McConnell's right.

Terri types on her arm keypad. She's amazed.

Terri nods. McConnell starts unscrewing his helmet ring.

Luke follows suit.

Terri starts taking off her helmet. In a few moments, all

three helmets are off. They hold them, glowing softly, against

their chests, as they breathe deeply and gratefully. Air.

And then, at this very moment, as if they have just passed

another kind of test...

HIGH, STRIATED WALL

Appears through the glare, soaring up before their startled

eyes. White, metallic, composed of complexly-linked bands,

plates, ramps. It's part of a STRUCTURE whose overall height

and breadth keep us from understanding its purpose. But the

hatch opening slowly in its side, at the top of an approach

ramp, is unmistakable. Radiant white light streams out from

within, forming a glowing tunnel, down towards the astronauts.

THE ASTRONAUTS BLINK

Raising their gloves against the dazzling glow. At the end

of this tunnel of light, inside the hatch frame

A SHAPE MATERIALIZES

And slowly resolves itself into a glowing humanoid form,

which we somehow sense is female. She appears benign,

wondrous. This glowing MARTIAN -- a holograph -- regards the

astronauts for a few moments, then beckons to them, as if to

say "Enter." All her motions are both calm and calming --

precise, unhurried, gracious.

MCCONNELL, LUKE AND TERRI

Look at each other. They're awed into silence, and still

tense, but now more out of excitement and anticipation than

fear. Their eyes agree: Let's go.

They walk forward slowly, carrying their helmets, up the

ramp and into the tunnel of light, following the Martian,

who retreats before them. They go through the hatch and

disappear inside.

INT. MARTIAN STRUCTURE. DUSK

Following the Martian, they find themselves in a round, open

space, defined by light, with a smooth matte-metallic floor,

but without apparent walls.

The Martian stops, turns, facing them. The astronauts stop,

too, uncertain what they're meant to do. Then the Martian

gestures again.

A cylindrical holographic column appears, rising from the

floor in front of the astronauts. Inside it, a swirl of eerie

lights, millions of them, like cosmic fireflies...

MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI

Set down their helmets, then cautiously converge around this

column, forming a loose triangle. As they stare into it, the

myriad lights are reflected off their own eyes and their

spacesuits.

IN THE HOLOGRAPHIC COLUMN

The whirling lights resolve into images, which relate to

them the story of ancient Mars:

A BLUE PLANET

we do not recognize. All is peaceful, beautiful.

INTERCUT

SUDDENLY A HUGE ASTEROID

Tumbles through space towards the planet...

ON THE PLANET - CLOSER VIEW

As thousands of small rocketships lift away from the surface,

heading in a stream out of the solar system...

THE ASTEROID IMPACTS

And a wall of fire and debris scours the planet. Oceans boil

and vaporize. Two gigantic hunks are blasted out of the

planet, spinning in flames...

MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI

Involuntarily flinch, bathed in the fiery images...

THE PLANET IS NOW DEAD

As dust storms roil across its cold, lifeless surface. The

flaming hunks of molten rock cool into twin moons.

THE ASTRONAUTS

Stare at this devastation, deeply moved.

IN DEEP SPACE

The stream of Martian ships grows smaller and smaller as it

continues on its epic voyage towards a new solar system.

Then we zero in on

ONE PARTICULAR ROCKETSHIP

As it peels off and goes in another direction. Graphics show

a model of what the ship contains: the familiar double helix

of DNA. The ship heads towards another blue planet in our

solar system...

EARTH

As it was then. More clouds than now, more ocean, and the

landforms all wedged together.

TERRI

Her voice is soft.

THE LONE MARTIAN SHIP

Makes a fiery streak through Earth's atmosphere and plunges

into the ocean.

Instantly the image of the DNA double helix grows, filling

the entire holographic column, then it begins to spin and

pulse, disintegrating into a phantasmagoric whirl of new

images...

MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI

Cry out, stunned by the strobelike power of the display as

LIVING FORMS

Flash into the holographic column, swimming, growing,

crawling, leaping, flying: one-celled microscopic organisms,

plankton, plants of all kinds, insects, then fish, dinosaurs,

birds, small mammals, larger mammals -- the entire stunning

panorama of evolution, distilled into a single explosive

sequence, as the images wash over the dazzled, awestruck

FACES OF THE ASTRONAUTS

Until finally the images whirl away, the holographic column

dissolves, leaving only a circle of glowing, concentric,

colored rings on the floor. The astronauts are left staring

at each other across the open space where the column had

been.

THE MARTIAN

Now comes forward with outstretched arms and completes their

circle, taking the fourth position. McConnell is opposite

her glowing form, and Terri and Luke are at either side. The

Martian reaches her arms out, inviting them to link hands.

As they do so, the Martian seems to be staring directly into

McConnell's eyes.

MCCONNELL

Is in wondrous awe, his whole face radiant with joy. It's

the first time we've ever seen him utterly without sadness

or reserve. Staring at the Martian, he understands.

McConnell and Luke look at her.

We hear a BELL-LIKE TONE, a single lingering high note, and

simultaneously the outermost ring of the circle on the floor

begins to glow brightly. It is an intense chromium yellow.

THE ASTRONAUTS

Step back, startled, unlinking their hands, and look at the

circle of colored rings. These shade from yellow, on the

outer rim, to a deeper yellow, then orange, then finally

reds. Inside the final, deep red ring is a circle of indigo

blue, about a meter across. Small points of light glitter

here, like stars against a midnight sky.

THE MARTIAN

Steps closer to McConnell. She has picked him out in

particular. Now she beckons for him to move inside the circle

of colored rings, to stand on the indigo core.

MCCONNELL

Looks back at her, nods his understanding. For the first

time she seems to smile. Benevolence, reassurance. Then as

abruptly as she first appeared, she fades away. Vanishes.

Luke and Terri look at McConnell, confused. There is a sudden,

static-filled CRACKLE from their helmets, nearby on the floor.

Terri picks up her helmet, leans into its mike.

Even through the scratchy interference, they can hear the

relief in Phil's voice. And then the desperation.

And then they hear only STATIC. His signal is lost.

Suddenly the BELL-LIKE TONE REPEATS, at a lower register,

with a more sustained note, and simultaneously, the last of

the yellow circles of light begins to fade, as

THE FIRST ORANGE BAND

Begins to glow brighter. McConnell turns, looking at this

new color, then looks back at Luke and Terri.

Terri looks at Luke, alarmed.

She scoops up Luke's helmet, tosses it to him. As he catches

it, she's already starting back out, in the direction they

came from, and Luke follows her. Until they both become aware

that McConnell isn't with them. They turn back. He's still

rooted to the spot, his gaze locked on the indigo core of

the colored rings.

McConnell doesn't turn.

Coming back, she sees how calm he is. How certain.

He looks into their faces. Terri is trying to grasp this

idea, still incredulous. Luke has the beginning of a half

smile.

Luke nods at the memory of Maggie's words. Terri remembers

too. McConnell's passionate conviction is affecting them

both.

Terri looks at Luke. Luke is smiling. He understands.

Luke steps closer, looking at his old friend.

They clasp hands for a moment. But in this moment is a

lifetime of camaraderie, an eternity of farewell.

Luke nods, deeply moved. He turns away, picking up his helmet,

as Terri comes closer, looking at McConnell, a long unspoken

beat. Her eyes are glistening.

Terri smiles. She is starting on the road to recovery. She's

going to be okay.

Terri nods. She digs into one of her suit's pockets, pulls

something out. She hands it to McConnell, and his fist closes

around it.

McConnell smiles. Terri smiles back at him. Then she turns,

picks up her helmet, and crosses to where Luke has paused,

looking back.

Luke and Terri exchange a final silent farewell with him,

then hurry away, into the darkness.

MCCONNELL

Looks down at what Terri gave him.

IT'S WOODY'S NECK CHAIN

With the little Flash Gordon rocketship.

MCCONNELL

Grips this tightly as he looks up.

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT

The hanger-like hatch has reopened, and Luke and Terri,

helmeted again, emerge from the Face. The leading edge of

the dust storm is upon them. They can't see much more than a

few meters.

As they reach the rover, they hear, even in this chaos, that

the deep pulsing tone of the Face has started again. They

look at each other, uncertain what this means. But McConnell

is now beyond their help. Luke keys his mike.

INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT

Phil gets no response. He is shaking, almost crying. He

hesitates, then starts hitting some keys.

CLOSE ON HIS COMPUTER DISPLAY

Which reads: "PRE-LAUNCH CHECKLIST."

INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT

McConnell has shed his backpack, with its unneeded oxygen

tank. He steps cautiously onto the colored rings. Nothing

seems to happen. Moving further, he takes his place on the

indigo circle at their core. He looks at

THE GLOWING TAKE-OFF COUNTDOWN INDICATOR

As it dips from orange into red; the BELL TONES are continuous

now, very deep and rapid.

EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT

The rover, with Luke and Terri inside, races away towards

the safety of the ERV, as the maelstrom boils over the Face

behind them. The sky is purplish black, thick with flying

debris and eerie lightning flashes. Towering billows of dust

chase them over the plain, nearly enveloping them as they

speed towards us, passing OUT OF FRAME.

INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT

McConnell reacts, surprised, as suddenly

A TRANSPARENT, GLASS-LIKE CYLINDER

Begins to rise around him, swiftly and smoothly, coming up

from the circumference of the indigo circle.

Then a second, identical cylinder -- the top half -- drops

down from somewhere overhead. The two sections meet and fuse

in a flash of light, containing McConnell inside them, as

neatly as if he were in a giant, transparent mailing tube.

MCCONNELL

Fights against a stab of claustrophobia. Is he being

imprisoned? Or somehow protected? Either way, he's virtually

immobilized. In this tight space in his bulky suit, he can't

even move his arms. Only his head and neck can still shift.

INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT

Phil is going over his final pre-launch checklist, flipping

switches and pressing buttons. He looks at his

DIGITAL CLOCK

Which reads "1350."

PHIL IS STRICKEN, TORMENTED

His finger hovers over a "Fire" button. He licks his lips

nervously, squeezes his eyes shut, and hits the button.

CLOSE ON COMPUTER DISPLAY

And the words: "IGNITION SEQUENCE INITIATED"

INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT

McConnell is straining inside the cylinder that surrounds

him, when something catches his attention. He arches his

neck, looking down.

A COBALT-BLUE TRANSPARENT LIQUID

Is beginning to fill the cylinder! It swirls in, from some

unknown source, rising rapidly; already his lower boots are

covered.

MCCONNELL'S EYES

Widen in alarm. He strains against the sides of the cylinder

but

HIS GLOVED HANDS

Slide helplessly across the smooth surface.

MCCONNELL

Looks down again.

THE COBALT LIQUID

Is up to his knees. Now his thighs...

MCCONNELL

Cranes his neck, staring up. Can he wedge himself higher,

can he somehow climb to safety?

ABOVE HIM

The entire "ceiling" of the Face is becoming translucent. He

can see the dust storm, boiling overhead. And now, rising

into this, are fiery coils of energy from the Face itself.

These swirl and twist in every direction, like angry water

snakes; battered by the fierce winds. Two vast forces on a

collision course.

INT. ROVER. NIGHT

Luke drives the rover through the blinding storm, as Terri

stares at a dashboard computer screen. They have to shout to

be heard over the ROARING WIND.

Luke looks over alarmed.

CLOSE ON A DIAL

As the needle spins freely, giving no direction whatsoever.

EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT

The Rover races towards us, the front of the storm chasing

it from behind, then completely overtaking the Rover. It

disappears from view!

INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT

Phil sits in the pilot's seat. He is looking at a computer

graphic that shows the engines readying to launch. With

resignation, he keys his mike.

Phil waits a second, then reaches slowly for a blinking red

switch that reads "LAUNCH." He hesitates, then actually has

his fingers on it, about to flip it, when he hears a crackle

of static on the radio. Phil keys his mike.

And Phil chokes back a sob. Blinking back the tears, he tries

to compose himself, then keys his mike.

EXT. THE FACE. NIGHT

FROM GROUND LEVEL we see that the coils of energy are rising

from the forehead of the Face, from its "third eye," spinning

and looping faster and faster, starting to form a vortex.

But unlike the wind vortex that killed the Mars One crew,

this is a vortex of fire. As we watch, more fiery streaks

begin to emerge from the sides of the Face, from the chin,

cheeks and temples. These all rush upwards, like lava flowing

uphill, gathering in intensity as they leap free of the Face

itself and spiral into the atmosphere. The peak of the forming

vortex is already piercing the lowest layer of storm clouds,

causing a dark counter-swirl.

EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. NIGHT

Phil stands at the bottom of the ERV's ladder, gripping it

to steady himself, staring into the swirling dust.

THE ROVER appears out of the dust and sand, the immense storm

seeming to chase it from behind. Luke and Terri climb out,

struggle towards him through the wind. Phil grips their hands,

helping them over to the ladder. He looks back, confused.

Phil stares at her, bewildered.

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. MARTIAN SHIP. NIGHT

LOOKING DOWN INTO THE CYLINDER, we see that the cobalt-blue

fluid has risen to McConnell's upper chest. Now it's at his

shoulders! It pours into his suit through his neck ring.

He strains on tiptoes, craning his head back, trying to keep

his unhelmeted face above the rising liquid.

He sucks in deep desperate gulps of air, his head thrashing

from side to side. Then suddenly the fluid is over his mouth,

his nose, his forehead. His whole body is submerged!

The level of fluid continues to rise towards the unseen top

of the cylinder.

MCCONNELL

Squeezes his eyes shut, holding his breath. Not so much

fighting this anymore as simply floating in place, waiting

for his inevitable death...

EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT

WIDEVIEW FROM ABOVE, as the energy vortex bends from side to

side, pushing back the swirling storm that surrounds the

Face. As the vortex coalesces its energy into a cylindrical

shape, we see through its center to a rising form -- the

Martian ship. It is a flattened convex circle whose matte-

metallic angles replicate the "Face" imagery.

EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT. SIDEVIEW FROM INSIDE THE FACE

As the Face burns away around us, the Martian ship begins to

rise and spin.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT

The vortex is now a tight, rapidly spinning cylinder. As it

draws more and more power from the disintegrating Face, the

Martian ship in its center spins faster and faster.

INT. MARTIAN SHIP. NIGHT

MCCONNELL'S FACE

Is spinning and shaking too, more and more violently, as the

huge buildup of G-forces tears at his body. We're reminded

of Nick Willis just before the vortex exploded him; is the

same thing about to happen to McConnell?

His eyes remain tightly shut, bubbles are streaming from his

lips. His last breath is nearly exhausted, it's being shaken

from his lungs.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT

As we MOVE IN CLOSER ON HIS FACE, we suddenly see, with him,

a SERIES of rapid-fire, almost subliminal IMAGES FROM THE

PAST. We recognize each one. Previously, though, we saw them

as still photos; now they have movement, life, and we view

them from new and slightly different angles. These images

INTERCUT with glimpses of McConnell's pale, shaking, near-

death face in the present...

THE YOUNG MCCONNELL

Under the Christmas tree, lifts his new model rocket from

its box. He turns to us, smiling joyfully. A blinding white

flash, and he disappears...

THE TEENAGED MAGGIE

Is on her porch, under a night sky, bending down to the

eyepiece of a TELESCOPE. She looks up at us with a shy, proud

smile. A blinding white flash and she's gone...

Sequence omitted from original script.

MAGGIE AND MCCONNELL

In flight suits, holding their helmets, stand on the wing of

a fighter jet. The radiant young couple turn to each other,

kissing. A blinding white flash and they vanish...

MAGGIE MCCONNELL

In an astronaut's pressure suit, drifts rapidly towards us,

reeling in along a tether. A man's gloved hand is

outstretched, reaching for her. As she grips the hand, we

see her triumphant expression through her faceplate. A

blinding flash; she's gone...

MCCONNELL'S FACE - IN THE PRESENT

Is shaking savagely; he is very near death. And then, all at

once, the SHAKING STOPS.

Time itself seems to stop.

McConnell opens his eyes, staring STRAIGHT AT US. And then,

fully accepting his fate, he throws his head back, opens his

mouth and takes in a deep lungful of the fluid. He can breathe

it.

His eyes widen in surprise and understanding. He can breathe

it! This fluid will keep him alive! His whole body relaxes,

the tension draining from his head and shoulders, as he fully

trusts this launch for the first time. And then, with his

eyes wide open, he sees, from memory, one final image...

BRIDAL VEIL IS LIFTED

And REVEALS, in CLOSEUP, the beautiful face, the shining

eyes of MAGGIE McCONNELL. Beatific, eternal. She gazes

directly INTO CAMERA, then smiles...

MCCONNELL

Smiles back.

EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT

WIDE VIEW, FROM ABOVE, as the energy vortex changes from red-

orange to blue-white. It ROARS with terrifying power as its

top starts to bend, angling like a telescope towards a

specific point in the stars. Then the Martian ship -- a

rounded darker form, little more than a blip within the vast,

blue-white column of energy -- shoots away from the surface,

leaving only a blacked crater where the Face had been.

EXT. MARS. HIGH ATMOSPHERE. NIGHT

ANGLE FROM DEEP SPACE, LOOKING DOWN, as the Martian ship,

riding its blue-white column of energy, streaks up into the

vast blackness, like a narrowly focused spotlight piercing

the night. Down below, we can see the dust storm in all its

vastness still boiling orange and brown across the planet's

surface, which it now completely covers.

As the Martian ship flashes by us, it passes another ship,

much smaller and slower, rising through the storm clouds on

a different trajectory. We recognize the familiar, comfortable

sight of the ERV.

PUSHING IN QUICKLY ON THIS.

We see three figures in the cockpit.

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT

Luke, Terri and Phil are strapped in, with their acceleration

just starting to level off, when suddenly their cockpit

interior is starkly bathed in white light. They wince at the

unearthly radiance, shielding their faceplates with gloved

hands.

Through their cockpit window, they watch the Martian ship

hurtle by them at a hundred times their speed.

Luke nods. Their eyes are glistening. Luke's voice is a

whisper, both of prayer and farewell.

EXT. SPACE

Looking through the cockpit window we see the Martian ship

receding into the infinite distance of space -- a long blue-

white scratch that in moments begins to fade. Finally it is

a tiny point of light, taking its place amongst the limitless

expanse of the star-filled heavens.
