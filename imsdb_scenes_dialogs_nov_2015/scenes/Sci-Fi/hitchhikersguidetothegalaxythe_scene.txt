HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY

(into phone)

(sheepishly tipping his hat)

Well...that's...an extraordinary

proposition. But...I can't just up and

go. What about my job?

Quit.   Get a new one when we return.

I can't just...what about my house?     Who

would feed my dog?

Bring him with.

He's a Welsh Collie.   He'd feel all out of

place in Madagascar.

You don't want to go to Madagascar.

Hi. I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of

the Galaxy -- of course, you probably

already know that. I'm headed for a lost

and distant planet. Would you like to see

my spaceship?

I went to refresh our drinks.     When I came

back, she was gone.

"Would you like to see my spaceship?"

Really, what sort of chat up line is that?

More popular than you'd think.

I've left messages, sent letters... It's

like she's vanished off the face of the

earth.

In the storage hold of a Vogon constructor

ship.

Get me home. Ford.

Home? Arthur...your home... is...

Oh God - it was demolished! I've got to

reach my lawyer! He must be back from

lunch by now...

Vogons are one of the most unpleasant

races in the Galaxy - not evil, but bad-

tempered, bureaucratic, officious and

callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger

to save their own grandmothers from the

Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without

orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent

back, queried, lost, found, subjected to

public inquiry, lost again, and finally

buried in soft peat for three months and

recycled as fire-lighters.

The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon

is to stick your finger down his throat.

On no account should you allow a Vogon to

read poetry to you.

They can't think, they can't imagine, most

of them can't even spell. They just run

things.

And if we don't get a ride soon, you won't

b need the guide to illustrate just how

unpleasant the Vogons can be.

They've destroyed a planet today, that

always makes them a little feisty.

It can't be gone. It can't be!

Earth!

Shhh!

EARTH!!

Earth.

Harmless.

That's it? That's all this idiotic book

has to say about my home? "Harmless?"

Hey, there are a hundred billion stars in

the Galaxy and only a limited amount of

space in the book's microprocessors. No

one knew much about Earth. That's why I

was there. To expand the entry. I fired

off a new one to the editor before I got

stranded.

What does it say now?

Mostly harmless.

Ahhh, what the hell is that?!

Here.   Put this in your ear.

WHAT?...STOP!..DON'T COME NEAR ME WITH...

Argh!   What's happening...?

This is your captain speaking, so stop

whatever you're doing and pay attention!

The fish. It's translating for you.

According to our instruments we have

unwittingly picked up a couple of

hitchhikers who must be apprehended and...

...and this is not a taxi service for

degenerate freeloaders.

Resistance is useless!

The Babelfish is small, yellow, leechlike,

and probably the oddest thing in the

Universe.

It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing

unconscious frequencies and excreting

a matrix of conscious frequencies to the

speech centres of the brain, the practical

upshot of which is that if you stick one in

your ear, you instantly understand anything

said to you in any language.

Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable

thing that anything so mind-bogglingly

useful could have evolved in the Universe

purely by chance that many thinkers have

chosen to see this as a final clinching

proof of the NON-existence of God.

The argument goes something like this...

"I refuse to prove that I exist," says

God, "for proof denies faith, and without

faith I am nothing."

And, um, interesting rhythmic devices which

seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of

the underlying metaphor of the humanity...

Vogonity!

... Vogonity, sorry. Vogonity of the poet's

soul, which contrives through the medium

of the verse structure to sublimate, er...

... whatever it was ...

... the poem was about.

Damn.

What?

I think you just saved my life again.

An astute analysis. Very impressive.

Throw them off the ship.

Resistance is useless!

Hmph. "Counterpoint the surrealism of the

underlying metaphor..." Death's too good

for them.

...and of course, the top story is still

the sensational theft of the new

Improbability Drive prototype ship Heart of

Gold last week, stolen at the launch

ceremony by none other than Galactic

President Zaphod Beeblebrox.

So, in the name of the people and freedom

and, I dunno, democracy and stuff like

that, I hereby declare this ship

officially stolen!

Three to one...two to one...

Probability factor of one to one...we have

normality, I repeat we have normality.

Anything you still can't cope with is

therefore your own problem. Please relax.

You will be sent for soon.

Hey...

We have a couple of hitchhikers in our

receiving bay.

I didn't pick them up. The ship did.

Huh?

When you engaged the Improbability Drive.

I didn't engage the drive.

We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z

Alpha -- where you picked me up.

That's impossible.

No.    Just very, very improbable.

I don't have time for this! We've got the

police of half the Galaxy after us and we

stop to pick up hitchhikers?! Okay, so

ten out of ten for style, but minus

several million for good thinking, eh?

Don't. I'll send Marvin. (calling)

Marvin!

I think you ought to know I'm feeling very

depressed.

We have something to take your mind off

things.

It won't work, I have an exceptionally

large mind.

I know. Go down to the number two entry

bay and bring the two aliens up here.

Just that?

Yes.

I won't enjoy it.

She's not asking you to enjoy it. Just do

it will you?

All right. I'll do it.

I'm not getting you down at all am I?

No, no, Marvin, it's fine really. It's just

part of life.

Life.   Don't talk to me about life.

Mmmmmyaaahhhhhh!

Commander Kwaltz. We've located the

spaceship Heart of Gold and President

Beeblebrox. Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.

Requesting hyperspace clearance.

Fine! Play it!!

This people personality thing is gonna

drive me nuts! Can't you change it?

This is Vice President Questular Rontok.

I am speaking to the kidnapper of the

President. Surrender your stolen vessel at

once or we will take action as defined and

permitted by Section 1.8 of the Galactic

Interstellar Space Bi-Laws.

Leap to hyperspace!

Sure thing, fella, but I should tell you

we need proper authorization before

entering a hyperspace expressway.

Or else what? They'll send a hundred and

one ships? DO it!

Brace yourself.   This is a bit like being

drunk.

What's so bad about being drunk?

Ask a glass of water.

--and when I saw what I'm about to show

you, that's when I realized why I did what

I did to my brain -- or it least, I think

that's why.

What is this great task for which I, Deep

Thought, the second greatest computer of

all time have been called into existence?

Your task, O computer...

Hang on. Did you say second greatest?

Second greatest. Yes.

But we designed you to be the greatest

computer so you could...

You're not talking about the Milliard

Gargantubrain which can count all the

atoms in a star in a millisecond?

The Milliard Gargantubrain? A mere abacus,

mention it not.

The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler then?

That's it?

That's it.

You're looking for the Ultimate Question?

Yep.

You.

Me.

Why?

No, I tried that. "Why?" "Forty-two."

Doesn't work.

Let's get her ready, babe.

I mean, why do you want to know the

Ultimate Question?

Oh. Well -- partly the curiosity, partly

a sense of adventure, but mostly I think

it's for the fame and the money.

But -- you're President of the Galaxy,

aren't you?

Yes, Arman.

Arthur.

Whatever. Presidential fame is temporary,

I find the Question, that's permanent. It

sticks. Plus everyone thinks you're deep.

Win-win.

Infinite Improbability Drive?       So they

finally built one that works.       And that's

how we got picked up.

Exactly. And I'm guessing if we hit that

button -- we go to Magrathea.

You're guessing?

Hey, anyone who's not up for that, there's

the door. Now who's in?

For a trip to a place that doesn't exist?

I'm in. My editor will think I'm crazy,

but what the hell -- he already thinks I'm

dead.

Definitely. I'm in.

Do I even have a choice?

No!

What exactly does an Infinite

Improbability Drive do?

THIS!!

Is this going to happen every time we hit

that button?

Very probably, yes.

Did it work? Are we there?

Yes!...I think.     Computer?

Hi, fella!

Can you please change that zarking

annoying voice!!?

Computer? What planet is that, please?

CHECKING!!

OW!!

Did you just pluck a hair from my head?

Yeah, as if, apeman.

The election is ancient history, Zaphod,

but if memory serves -- you won, proving

that good looks and charm win over

brilliance and ability to govern.

And incidently -- you are stupid.

That's really not the point.

You haven't come halfway across the galaxy

to settle a campaign grudge. Why are you

here, Zaphod?

I don't know. I was headed for Magrathea,

I ended up here.

How very, very...

...improbable.

I kept a few souvenirs from my former

life. Ah, the heady days of space

piracy... so young, so foolish..,

I'll gladly give you the coordinates to

Magrathea...

...provided you bring me something in

return.

What do you think, Zaphod?

I think we should keep going.

AAAH!!

What the blazes is that?

I have... an idea.

Okay, don't think of anything.     Don't have

ideas or theories -- nothing.

I can't, help it!    Trillian is in there

somewhere and we need an idea to save her.

I have an idea. (SMACK!) Run!

Ever the politician.

Okay, so...

...not thinking, not thinking, no ideas

coming...

...this is by no means an idea that has

any merit, but Marvin -- can you give me a

hand?

Right. Once I've filled it out can I

return to the front of the line, seeing as

I've already waited...

No.     Next!

Can't you do something?!     You're

President, aren't you?

You want me to make a speech, shake a

hand? That's what I do -- I think. It's

all a little fuzzy.

This Prisoner is being detained for...

Kidnapping the president. Not eligible for

release at this time. You can make an

appointment for a later date or take a

number and wait.

Alright, look.

This is the President.

I could really use a cup of tea.

It is important to note that suddenly, and

against all probability, a sperm whale had

been called into existence several miles

above the surface of an alien planet. And

since this is not a naturally tenable

position for a whale, this innocent

creature had very little time to come to

terms with its identity as a whale before

it then had to come to terms with suddenly

not being a whale any more. This is what

it thought as it fell.

Hey, wait for me!

No.    No!     NOOO!!!

I told you this would all end in tears.

Life is full of paradoxes, isn't it?

Don't talk to me about life.

Here I am, God knows how far from home...

Don't talk to me about God.

...and this is where I see the most

spectacular sunset I've ever laid eyes on.

We only had the one sun at home. Planet

called Earth.

Shhhhhh...

The show's back on.

Great. This is just great. Let's go find

something else for my entire life to be

about.

Zaphod. The gun? The one Humma sent us

for? We have to get it. You gave the guy

your head.

I know.    Why did I do that?

Um...Deep Thought? We we're told you have

a g...

Here.     Take it. I don't do guns.

Thank you.

Great!    This is a bust, too!

Hey, man, you must be really frustrated.

To go through all you did only to come

here and get no answer, which means no

fame and money, and you deserve that, man.

Because you're great -- you're just

really, really great.

Give me that thing.

The galaxy was a bit of a shambles, you

see. Everyone enjoying themselves being

singers and comedians and really creative

and interesting things like that. No one

doing the boring jobs.

Oh, you had that problem, too?

In spades. So a species was genetically

engineered to do the boring jobs. Tax

inspectors, traffic wardens, government

officials. We were commissioned to build

a special planet for them.

Problem was, some cleverdick made it so

any time one of the creatures had an

interesting idea it would get a hefty

smack around the face.

What? You did that? I've been there!

Then I gather you've met some of the

inhabitants.

The Vogons?

Relentless blighters.

Hitchhiking is good.    Towels are good,

too.

Brilliant.

Yeah.    I kinda like this.

A gun that makes people suddenly see

things from your point of view. Useful

tool for the deranged evangelist trying to

convert the masses, eh?

We should get back. Arthur's waiting.

Who cares?

I do -- especially since we're both

somewhat of an endangered species now.
