7/29/1993

FADE IN:

INT. PROFESSOR OCK"S PRIVATE PHYSICS LABORATORY, THE

CYCLOTRON ROOM (CREDIT SEQUENCE) - DAY

A mighty WARNING KLAXON assaults our ears. A FLASHING RED

WARNING LIGHT stabs our eyes.

Several DIALS go into the RED. A hand pushes aside a

YELLOW THERMOS and pushes forward a RED POWER THROTTLE.

We hear the WHINING UP of a cyclotron. A DIGITAL DIAL

climbs to "5% POWER." A SPIDER crawls across a DIAL.

Begin OPENING CREDITS.

THE CYCLOTRON ROOM is in an old basement full of peeling

paint and plumbing wrapped with TAPE. Leaks are here and

there. COBWEBS are all around.

DOCTOR OTTO OCTAVIUS (OCK) is a strong but strange

featured man in his mid-fifties.

His assistant, WEINER, hovers nearby looking on. He's

open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. WEINER is

a local, small-time hood hired by OCK to circumvent the

school administration and to "procure" whatever OCK needs

for his experiments. He shades his eyes against a searing

BLUE-WHITE BEAM that erupts from the WINDOW. THE ROOM IS

DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL ROOM AND THE EXPERIMENT CHAMBERS.

With a WHOOSH, the WINDOW EXPLODES, showering the TWO with

shards of GLASS, and throwing them to the floor.

But OCK is already at the THROTTLE. The cyclotron whirls

up. The lights go on. Louder, brighter than before. OCK

looks through the broken WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL

CHAMBER. The POWER DIAL inches upward, "eight, nine..."

the BLUE-WHITE LIGHT is blinding now. The WHINE pitch is

shattering.

END OPENING CREDITS.

The POWER DIAL hits ten.

EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY

As STUDENTS go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills

out of the SCIENCE CENTER onto the grounds of Empire State

University.

We see PETER PARKER, a pleasant faced senior who's among

the top in his class. Sincere and serious, he has yet to

develop a way with women.

LIZ ALLEN is also a senior. She's beautiful and

intelligent.

HARRY is the school nerd. A quirky kid who, like PETER,

can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty

ones like Liz.

Despite PETER'S protesting body language, HARRY pulls him

away like a conspirator.

A HAND reaches in and smacks her bottom.

They kiss and walk away.

HARRY makes a gesture dismissing OCK as crazy.

INT. CYCLOTRON AREA HALLWAY - DAY

It is a basement hallway full of LOCKERS which STUDENTS

are banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take

stuff out. In their midst, a MAN is banging on the door

marked "Cyclotron Room - Authorized Personnel Only!"

Professor ROSOMORF, SIXTISH, respectable, a good old

fashioned professor, he's the head of the Physics Dept.

With him is ALEXANDER THORKEL, a 40-ish, Waspish school

administrator. For a scientist as crazily focused as OCK,

THORKEL is a natural enemy.

The LIGHT above THORKEL's head EXPLODES. Then all the

LIGHTS behind him EXPLODE in succession. THORKEL and ROZ

look amazed...

INT. OCK'S LAB

FOUR WALDOS (three-fingered, snake-like mechanical arms)

suddenly thrust themselves into the CHAMBER and begin

working, each at a different task. OCK is an acknowledged

master at manipulating these WALDOS.

He flicks a switch and a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM lances

down from a FOCUSING CONE and strikes a GRAM WEIGHT

marked, "1,000,000"), illuminating it and filling our

ears with a splitting BUZZ TONE.

The knock on the door grows louder.

WEINER comes up behind OCK.

INSERT: The DIAL marked "RELATIVE GRAVITY" reads

"1,000,000" but suddenly it snaps to "0.999999!"

The WEIGHT begins to jiggle and, for an instant, it

appears to lift ever so slightly.

INT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY

This is an enormous room, 100 lab tables. The yellowing

smoke of a thousand experiments hangs in the air. A HUGE

AMERICAN FLAG dominates the back wall.

PETER, HARRY and LIZ set up their TABLES. FLASH reads the

DAILY BUGLE sports section. PETER can't take his eyes off

LIZ. When she looks back he looks down at his GEAR.

INT. OCK'S LAB

WEINER opens the door and sees ROZ and THORKEL waiting

impatient.

THORKEL looks at ROZ who waves his shoulder, then the both

call.

Professor OCK turns and looks at the bewildered men.

He starts to play his machines handles and buttons.

INT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY

The equipment on her TABLE is starting to vibrate. They

look at it, curiously. We hear the cyclotron's WHINE

begin to build...

INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - DAY

Everything is shaking like in an earthquake... Roz and

Thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with

anger and surprise. The WHINE is deafening! The light is

blinding! WEINER has his eyes closed and his hands over

his ears.

WEINER crosses himself. The CONSOLE erupts in sparks.

INT. ELECTRICAL CONDUIT MONTAGE - DAY

We follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along

the WIRES and CABLES inside the WALLS and FLOORS. It is

making its way up to the LAB!

INT. LAB - DAY

All the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating

equipment.

The CHARGE crackles up a WIRE and erupts at LIZ'S TABLE.

A BREAKER explodes in flames. There is an outburst of AD

LIBS: "Fire!" "Everybody out!"

THORKEL (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing

LIZ trapped behind the fire which is growing from second

to second.

He wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the FLAMES.

His sleeve is on fire. He pats it out.

Flash appears and tries to help but Thorkel stops him.

LIZ smashes at the WINDOW, but this is an inner city

school and the WINDOWS are covered by STEEL GATES. Liz

wraps her fingers in the GATE.

Outside the WINDOW the air is clear and people come and

go. Some are stopping to look up at the girl on the

second floor who screams (but they can't hear, of course)

down at them as the FLAMES close in behind her.

PETER comes flying in with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He

fumbles with it. FLASH pushes Thorkel, grabs the

extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain.

LIZ turns to face the FLAMES. Suddenly there is an

eruption of CO2 CLOUDS and the roar of a FIRE

EXTINGUISHER.

The FLAMES are beaten down enough for her to leap out.

FLASH is there, holding the EXTINGUISHER. People CHEER.

PETER is stung, insulted, turns away.

ROSOMORF peeps in, worried -- faces Thorkel.

OCK comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has

happened.

FLASH hands the EXTINGUISHER to PETER. LIZ embraces

FLASH, throwing a glimpse at PETER who tried so bravely.

He looks away and turns the last of the EXTINGUISHER on

the last of the FIRE.

THORKEL has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the

front of the huge LAB. He simply cannot believe OCK'S

behavior.

THORKEL steams out and bangs shut the DOOR.

WEINER backs away from the BLACKBOARD to reveal a word

that OCK has scrawled in large letters. It says "Anti-

Force."

OCK is plugging a HUGE CABLE into a small LUCITE BOX with

a SILVER BALL inside it.

LIZ scribbles down a note and mouths the word "gravity."

Then she turns to PETER.

OCK is "playing" his COMPUTER like the Phantom of the

Opera at the organ.

As the WHINE builds in the LAB...

OCK peers through the LUCITE BOX at us, distorted by it.

The BOX is a miniature version of the cyclotron's

experimental chamber, and now the BLUE-WHITE glow begins.

It crackles round the SILVER BALL.

The LIGHTS go totally dark. The kids react with WHOOPS

and CATCALLS.

OCK peers at us through the LUCITE BOX as the SILVER BALL

begins to rise. OCK'S face is ecstatic.

The SILVER BALL suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of

the box. It flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a

LIGHT FIXTURE.

The shards rain down on OCK who reaches out and catches

the falling BALL and scales it in a raised fist.

The CYCLOTRON WHINE cuts out and OCK wheels to the

COMPUTER. He hits a KEY and several COLORED PROJECTION

BEAMS lance out of the back of the room. They pierce the

smoke and light a PROJECTION DISPLAY in the front.

TWO COLORED SPHERES one, YELLOW, one BLUE touch where

their circumferences meet. Behind them is a BLACK

depiction of "space".

OCK hits another COMPUTER KEY and a hole appears where the

TWO SPHERES touch. The BLUE AND THE YELLOW MARBLEIZE with

each other. The colors swirl until both SPHERES are

INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

PETER, LIZ, FLASH and HARRY all take BOOKS from their

LOCKERS.

PETER looks at FLASH who's a few LOCKERS down. FLASH has

taken a FOOTBALL from his LOCKER and is spinning it on his

finger with great joy and concentration.

KIM comes by and leans seductively by her LOCKER. KIM is

a ripe one and hot-hot-hot!

KIM is pulling her pet, a foot long SALAMANDER, out of her

LOCKER. She wraps it around her neck and turns to the

boys.

They go bug-eyed!

Peter looks at KIM. Wow. Then he looks at LIZ who's

adjusting herself in a small MIRROR. HARRY jabs him in

the ribs. Yeah, yeah!

Everybody leaves and Harry is left alone, he throws his

bag down.

PETER turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking

WEINER.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

PETER enters wide-eyed behind WEINER. This place is a far

cry from the experiment in the LAB ROOM. It's a fantastic

netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance. No one

but PETER.

OCK is sitting in a swivel CHAIR with his back to PETER.

He has the look of Captain Nemo in his Nautilus. This is

OCK'S domain.

OCK turns sweet again. He smiles too broadly.

PETER begins to leave.

Peter looks worried then leaves.

OCK turns to WEINER who slouches against the wall smiling.

EXT. DAILY BUGLE - DAY

Establish as ART DECO BUILDING well beyond its prime. A

sign says: "The Daily Bugle." Peter enters the building.

INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY

Very forties, very messy. J. Jameson scans some PHOTOS as

PETER stands helplessly by.

JAMESON is 50ish, grey at the temples, brush cut on top.

He too is forties. His chewed up CIGAR is forties. This

guy is a hard case.

JAMESON comes to a picture of a BUSINESS SUITED MAN with a

MOHAWK. PETER smiles in anticipation.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A seedy east village walk up. Peter takes his camera and

takes various shots of a wino. ALL IN. He climbs the

stairs to his building, looks through the mail, he

collects from a beaten down mailbox.

INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - DAY

A one-room, shabby roof apartment, a chaos of books and

papers. A photo enlarger and darkroom baths in kitchen

pots; 8x10s tacked to the walls; a spare camera and

lenses. Self-consciously wacky kitsch; plastic dinosaurs,

wind-up toys, a stuffed carp. An unmade bed and a 50's

dinette set are the only furniture. A grimy skylight

leads to the roof. It's not a pretty place, but it has

personality. A voice from the kitchen, a shadow of an

intruder, is sneaking around.

She grabs her coat, crosses back to Peter and tugs on his

shoulder.

INT. LARGE COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT

It is dark and empty except for COMPUTERS. Sitting at it,

lit by the GLOW of its screen, is SOLOMON ROSOMORF (ROZ).

As he works, a DOOR opens behind him. Someone walks

quietly through the LAB. ROSOMORF keeps working. The

intruder approaches...

Off screen the voice of the CYCLOTRON WHINE begins to

build.

INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

OCK and WEINER are at work as before. OCK takes no notice

of the TWO MEN who come in, nor the WORKER who comes in

behind them and sets to work attaching a BIG LOCK to the

door.

OCK ignores him. WEINER touches OCK'S shoulder. OCK

ignores him too.

He points toward the worker who's working on the lock on

the main door.

OCK glares back and forth between the TWO MEN, the WORKER,

and WEINER. Then he pulls BACK the RED POWER THROTTLE.

The WHINE descends.

The WALDOS pull back and dangle from their panel. The

WHINE dies.

He signals to the worker to stop.

INT. APARTMENT OF AUNT MAY AND UNCLE BEN - NIGHT

The N.Y. Mets are playing baseball on T.V. PETER watches

with his UNCLE BEN, a paunchy 65 years old in POLYESTER

SLACKS and a COMFY OLD SWEATER. A N.Y. METS CAP is

perched on BEN'S head. A BEER CAN is in his hand. A

cluttered but familiar living room sprawls comfortably

around them.

AUNT MAY enters.

BEN nods, rises sluggishly and slowly, and turns the sound

off only. PETER moves toward his AUNT in the doorway.

INT. THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

PETER passes AUNT MAY and takes his seat.

INT. BASEMENT CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

WEINER is eating a large SANDWICH and a drinking a COKE.

A KNOCK

WEINER leaves. PETER wanders around.

He goes into the experimental chamber, he overlooks the

SPIDER which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open

WINDOW... and into the chamber.

OCK begins the experiment. We move in past the shattered

WINDOW. We see the SPIDER crawling on the chamber's GEAR.

OCK is angry... Ock now sees the SPIDER. He shoots out a

WALDO to try and crush it but the SPIDER is too fast. The

WALDO slams against the wall of the chamber. He starts to

push every button or switch in sight. A deafening whining

starts.

An URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the "Relative

Gravity" DIAL. It is at "4.999999KG" but suddenly the

numbers start to tumble rapidly.

INSERT: The glowing 5KG WEIGHT.

INSERT: The POWER DIAL inches toward 50% POWER!

PETER leaves.

Another URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the

monitor SCREEN. On it, flashing RED, is the word,

"OVERLOAD!" OCK pushes the RED POWER THROTTLE forward!

The WHINE increases to a PULSE and THROB.

INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

Incredibly lit, the SPIDER is dropping on it's shimmering

WEB-STRAND down toward the 5KG WEIGHT which now GLOWS in

time with the THROB and PULSE.

INT. THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The MONITOR is flashing "MAXIMUM OVERLOAD - SHUT DOWN!"

OCK continues with the experiment. And then he sees the

SPIDER!

He tries to shove the SPIDER with his hand.

INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

Through the BLUE-WHITE we can barely make out OCK on the

other side if the shattered WINDOW. He sends TWO WALDOS

after the SPIDER. The SPIDER evades him and jumps onto

the PROFESSOR's back. It then climbs onto the PROFESSOR's

neck and bites him.

The gravity DIAL goes to .000001, then pops back up as

OCK'S tiny world goes berserk. DIALS spin, crack, explode

or droop liquidly. WIRES dance on the CONSOLE which

erupts like the 4th of JULY.

OCK begins to float. His shirt begins to tear away. A

DIAL floats by with its pulled WIRES undulating like a

Medusa. WALDOS smash through the walls and flail like

snakes. OCK'S YELLOW THERMOS distorts and EXPLODES!

OCK, his hair wild, face locked in a multi-G grimace, is

pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with

SPARKS.

We see clearly the SPIDER still stuck to his neck.

The big beast buffets and shakes. Tubes, junctions,

valves and whatnot fall off, crashing to the floor where

they twitch and writhe with a life of their own.

Then, an enormous EXPLOSION rips a large hole in the

CYCLOTRON's side, sending debris and a HUNDRED MICRO-

STREAMS of ELECTRONIC PARTICLES lancing in our direction.

INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ultimate weirdness! The PULSING BLUE-WHITE LIGHT

penetrates first the DOOR of the CYCLOTRON ROOM and then

the very walls! LOCKERS bang, LAMPS POP, the ceiling sags

in a SURREAL, RUBBERY way.

The WALLS sag too! The CYCLOTRON SIGN pivots and embeds

itself in a WALL. A LADDER sinks in the WALL. The BLUE-

WHITE LIGHT dances wildly about in PULSES. Then,

suddenly, it stops... DEAD SILENCE. WEINER comes running

in holding a double decker sandwich and a large bottle of

Pepsi. Weiner enters OCK'S lab, singing, not at first

noticing what's going on. Suddenly he stops dead.

INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

A scene out of DALI's surrealistic canvas. There are

things inside of other things. DIALS look like DALI

watches. This place has been rippled to the max!

OCK lays face up, unconscious on the floor, a WALDO across

his chest. The SPIDER is weaving its web. CAMERA slowly

DOWN to see OCK. PIPES and WIRES are stuck to his body.

The WALDO seems to be wrapping him. He wakes up to see

those MECHANICAL ARMS buried in his body. They weave

around him as if they are looking for prey. He tries to

tear them out, but they seem to be a part of his body,

like his other limbs. He screams. Suddenly Weiner sees

OCK.

Suddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he

flies back and out through the door to the corridor.

INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

He hears the police sirens approaching, he runs away.

EXT. THE EMPIRE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

The long SCREAM segues to a POLICE SIREN. A COP CAR pulls

to a halt in front of the COLLEGE. Many NYPD CARS are

already there, along with a NUCLEAR REGULATORY VAN, some

AMBULANCES, a VAN from the ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

and TWO TV VANS. ROZ runs across the lawn.

POLICE STRUGGLE to hold back the crowd of press, students

and general gawkers.

J. JAMESON pushes to the front of the mob in time to see

TWO COPS hustle a BUGLE PHOTOGRAPHER back into it.

The MAN shakes his head. JAMESON throws down his CIGAR,

stomps it, and pulls out a fresh one. THORKEL arrives to

address the CROWD.

The CROWD closes on THORKEL.

This elicits a flood of AD LIBS: "I heard a terrible

explosion?" "Nuclear accidents?" "Meltdown?" "Genetic

engineering?" "Are you guys making mutants in there?"

In the back of the crowd are PETER, HARRY, LIZ, FLASH and

KIM.

PETER pushes forward.

He dashes off. FLASH shakes his head in dismay at this

guy.

EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

PETER approaches a CYCLONE FENCE keeping low and out of

sight. He leaps it like a skirmisher but fails

ignominiously in a heap. He's torn his PANTS and cut his

leg. He moves to the side of the building.

A DUMPSTER sits next to a FIRE DOOR. It's locked. As

PETER mulls over his next move, the LOCK clicks and the

DOOR slowly opens. PETER leaps on the DUMPSTER... and

falls in.

INT. DUMPSTER - NIGHT

PETER lays in the GARBAGE, a pained look on his face. He

rolls over and comes face to face with a wet DAILY BUGLE.

The headline reads, "Wave of Violence Rips City!" He pulls

himself up and peers out.

He sees a UNIFORMED GUARD hold the DOOR open for THREE MEN

IN RADIATION SUITS who remove some weirdly fused objects.

When they let the DOOR swing closed, PETER stops it by

inserting the NEWSPAPER in the top.

EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

PETER squeezes inside and jumps to knock out the

NEWSPAPER. The Door closes behind him.

INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Skewed, strange, surreal, PETER stares at the weirdness

and fumbles with his CAMERA. He snaps off a few shots,

then freezes when he hears a familiar voice.

Now we see ROZ and THORKEL following 2 GUARDS carrying OCK

in a stretcher. They all wear RADIATION SUITS. A waldo

sneaks out from under the sheet and hits Thorkel, as fast

as lightning. He falls back. He's covered with a SHEET

and attached to LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. Octavius moans.

PETER gets off a shot and ducks into the MEN'S room

leaving the DOOR ajar for a peak.

A WALDO slips down from the SHEET. PETER'S eyes go wide

at the sight. What in the hell has happened here?

INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

The URINALS are twisted in bizarre shapes. PIPES are

exposed and spout WATER. The MIRRORS look like something

out of a funhouse. PETER hears the STRETCHER go by.

PETER goes to the DOOR of OCK'S Lab and cracks it. PAN up

to the SPIDER, GLOWING softly, dangling from a SHIMMERING

STRAND above PETER.

As PETER looks out at the STRETCHER, the SPIDER drops on

his neck. He reacts by swatting it away. Bad move.

The GLOWING SPIDER now squats malevolently on the back of

PETER's hand. He stares at it transfixed. It bites.

PETER throws the SPIDER to the ripply tile floor where it

scuttles unsteadily out the door.

Sweat starts to bead on PETER'S face. He shakes his head

to clear it. His vision becomes uncertain. He lurches

against a WEIRD SINK.

PETER'S POV is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not

just moving in and out anamorphically. It's all of that!

PETER turns to see a UNIFORMED GUARD distorted by his

crazy vision.

EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

It bangs open. The GUARD throws PETER out and then throws

his BACK PACK at him.

EXT. UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

PETER melds into the crowd. As in a dream, JAMESON

appears at his side.

He hurries off. PETER peers after him and all of a sudden

his vision corrects to a perfect focus. The sweat is

gone. He's okay. He makes his way through the crowd to

the street.

We TRACK with PETER as the madding throng recedes behind

him. He turns a corner. He hears a SIREN.

An AMBULANCE screeches around the corner. It nearly hits

PETER who leaps to avoid it.

EXT. BRICK BUILDING - NIGHT

PETER'S cheek is pressed against the brick. He opens his

eyes and sees that he's hanging onto the side of the

building like a spider. And he's three stories up!

He looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him!

And the Ambulance which he jumped over is driving away.

He tries a downward step, but a BRICK dislodges and

crashes to the sidewalk. He takes an upward step. And

then another.

Tentatively at first, and then with growing confidence, he

"crawls" to the roof of the building. At the top he

gropes for a RAILING and slips. He dangles eight stories

above the street. Then, with a grunt, he vaults to the

roof one-handed.

EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

PETER is flat on his back, staring at the stars. He sits

up and looks wonderingly at his hands.

On the back of his right hand are TWO PUNCTURE WOUNDS

surrounded by a faint BLUE-WHITE PULSING GLOW. The GLOW

disappears.

He leaps to his feet. He flexes. Feels weird. Good

Weird. In fact, great weird! He tries a couple of

"jumping jacks" and on the third jump he soars into the

air!

The great, bespangled, NEW YORK CITY is his backdrop as

PETER jumps and turns and does loops in the air.

With the agility and tactility of a spider, PETER leaps

from the RAILING to a WALL to a FLAG POLE to another WALL

where he lands sideways and sticks.

He leaps off the WALL and lands at the edge of the roof.

He looks down. No one's looking back. So, he takes a

step back and leaps the alley to the next roof.

EXT. ROOFTOP SHACK - NIGHT

PETER lands on it. The next roof is seven stories up and

across the street. PETER bites his lip.

EXT. THE TALLER BUILDING - NIGHT

Backlit by a FULL MOON, PETER somersaults to the roof of

the taller building, and misses the top!

He sticks to the brick FACADE, upside down! He laughs

with the moment. A WINDOW opens below him and a pretty

BLONDE in a TOWEL sticks her head out. She looks this way

and that, and all she sees is a MAN in a LOUD SPORTCOAT

down the street. Never thinking to look up, she withdraws

into the room.

EXT. CHELSEA STREET - NIGHT

The MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT leans against a LAMP POST

and lights a CIGARETTE with a BEAT UP, SILVER PLATED

LIGHTER.

In the LIGHTER he sees a reflection of PETER leaping off

the taller building. He snaps around and looks up in time

to see PETER make it to the next FACADE.

EXT. ROOFTOP MONTAGE - NIGHT

With the UPTOWN SKYLINE behind him, PETER casts caution to

the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop.

Watching from the street, the MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT

follows PETER'S progress.

PETER leaps to a BROWNSTONE and lands amid the WASH.

He leaps up to a TENEMENT and lands on a BILLBOARD across

which he does a "bug crawl" and leaps again.

He touches down on a PIGEON COOP and bounds up and out of

frame again. The COOP OWNER, a LATINO in an undershirt

and a YANKEES CAP, comes running out of the COOP.

He's so surprised that he leaves the DOOR open and twenty

WHITE MORNING DOVES fly away in a furious flapping, free

at last. The LATINO lets out a stream of Hispanic

expletives complete with all the appropriately obscene

gestures.

PETER slides down a CABLE to a LAMP POST, and swirls down

the POLE to a PHONE BOOTH.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

PETER comes face to face with the man in the LOUD

SPORTCOAT. He gives PETER his CARD.

It screeches to a stop.

As the TAXI roars off...

PETER pulls out a QUARTER. And enters a phone booth. He

dials.

INT./ EXT. PHONE BOOTH/AUNT MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

As UNCLE BEN stirs fitfully

INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

Exit booth. He BANGS the PHONE BOOTH. Goes out and--

jumps lightly onto the phone booth roof.

INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

OCK is prepped for surgery. GOWNED PERSONNEL hurry about

with a feverish urgency. The CHIEF SURGEON checks the

SENSORS attached to OCK'S head. These seasoned

professionals are astonished and frightened.

OCK lays bare chested, face up, all FOUR WALDOS splayed.

He is a true cyborg. Part man, part machine. Part

organic, part molybdenum steel.

INSERT: The WALDO nearest the slap moves ever so slightly.

The triangular CLAW rotates a quarter turn and then turns

back.

The NURSE sees it and SCREAMS.

She slaps a HUGE ONE into his palm. He takes a deep

breath and goes to work. MASKED heads gather round him.

The SCALPEL is poised at the line where skin meets steel.

We make an incision. The INSTRUMENTS go crazy. WARNING

BELLS and BUZZERS sound.

A WALDO flashes around the steel leg of the operating

TABLE and clanks tight!

A HEART MACHINE is rushed in. They work frantically.

SURGEON #2 applies the CARDIAC SHOCK PADS.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

She leaves OCK and THORKEL alone.

OCK gets off his bed throwing away his sheet waving with

his 4 WALDOS and 2 arms.

A WALDO shoots up and grabs THORKEL by the throat. He

GASPS and SCREAMS silently as the telescoping WALDO lifts

him off his feet. He rises until his head is just inches

from the ceiling.

Then OCK smiles and slams THORKEL'S head through the

ceiling. PLASTER rains down. THORKEL'S legs scissor and

kick and then go limp. OCK throws his dead body on to the

bed, and covers him with the WHITE SHEETS.

INT. TAXI - NIGHT

Through the WINDOW of the TAXI we see MADISON SQUARE

GARDEN.

As it pulls up, a sign reads, "Midnight Madness! MTV's

Rock and Wrestling 'SLAMMY Awards!" The TAXI come to a

stop.

MAX REISS gets out, he is carrying a BOX.

REISS hustles PETER inside.

INT. CATACOMBS MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

We can hear the CROWD screaming at something in the

background as REISS leads PETER to an employee WASHROOM

and shows him the BOX.

He slaps the BOX against PETER'S chest and all but pushes

him inside.

INT. WASHROOM - NIGHT

PETER takes the suit out of the BOX. It is the SPIDER-MAN

SUIT! He looks at it and shrugs. Then he begins to

struggle into it.

PETER is looking at himself in the MIRROR. He is dressed

in all but the MASK. And he looks terrific! He flexes.

He smoothes his hair. He's starting to get into it.

INT. THE ARENA - NIGHT

CRUSHER COLE is destroying an opponent.

INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

REISS winces as the CROWD CHEERS and BOOS.

INT. THE RING - NIGHT

CRUSHER COLE is doing a big flexing number and the CROWD

is going wild. There are MTV CAMERAS and SIGNS and

BANNERS proclaiming the "SLAMMIES" everywhere.

The CROWD BOOS the slender newcomer who climbs awkwardly

through the ropes. Rock music blares. TWIN REDHEADS in

RED BIKINIS ring a bell.

CRUSHER COLE and SPIDER-MAN circle. COLE is twice

SPIDEY'S size. SPIDEY spots a TV CAMERA for the first

time. He momentarily freezes. CRUSHER sneers the CRUSHER

sneer. Then he charges!

With the agility of a spider, SPIDEY leaps out of the way.

CRUSHER comes back at him. SPIDEY leaps again, bigger!

The acrobatics get more and more dramatic as CRUSHER COLE

works himself up into a theatrical rage. Taunts erupt

from the CROWD.

SPIDEY, really getting into it now, begins playing for the

CAMERAS.

He misses SPIDEY again!

INT. LIZ/KIM'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

LIZ'S side is all schoolwork. KIM'S side is all ROCK

POSTERS and STUFFED ANIMALS. LIZ is curled up doing

homework. FLASH and KIM sit on the edge of the bed

watching the "SLAMMIES" on MTV.

INT. RING - NIGHT

The match continues in an increasingly spectacular

choreography. CRUSHER bellows at the SCREAMING CROWD.

But there's a gleam in his eye. This is it!

He charges. SPIDEY, playing the CAMERAS for all he's

worth, leaps way, way up. But this time CRUSHER stops

dead in his tracks. SPIDER-MAN comes back down into a

forearm SMASH that sends him reeling into a corner.

CRUSHER does a flying pin. 300 pounds. WOMP! The air

leaves SPIDEY in a rush as CRUSHER covers him, smothering

him. The CROWD goes WILD.

Not realizing his own strength and panicky about being

squashed, SPIDER-MAN throws CRUSHER COLE off him and up

into the air. Way up! Reiss cheers... Spider-Man comes

down and knocks CRUSHER for the first time.

CRUSHER flies away and out of the arena, eight rows back!

The HIPSTER sees CRUSHER coming at him and bolts from his

seat. CRUSHER lands on it, in between the TWO BLONDES who

break into utter hysterics.

SPIDEY, surprised at his own strength, watches CRUSHER

land.

The REF raises his hand in victory. The CROWD BOOS and

DEBRIS rains down. But some in the CROWD CHEER wildly,

recognizing the new sensation.

SPIDER-MAN steps down from the right as REISS leads the

CHEERS.

PETER turns with REISS and comes face to face with CRUSHER

COLE. Two ominous beats.

EXT. CITY STREET - NEAR A HOSPITAL - DAY

WE ARE TIGHT ON A NEW YORK JOURNAL TRUCK. On its SIDE

BANNER is a PICTURE of SPIDER-MAN'S face. Headline: "Who

is he? Mega-Smash Hits MTV!"

The TRUCK pulls away and we see PETER, LIZ, HARRY and KIM

standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross. PETER is

rocking on his heels and smirking.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR & ROOM - DAY

The NURSE leads PETER and LIZ and HARRY into the room.

We hold for a beat. When LIZ takes a step forward to look

around we expect the worst. But nothing grabs her.

PETER sees a pile of PLASTER on the floor. He looks up

and sees the hole in the ceiling. LIZ and HARRY look up

too. OCK is not there.

KIM screams.

INT. CORRIDOR TO OCK'S LAB - DAY

OCK, hiding his WALDOS under a white hospital robe. He

stalls until he reaches the door. Then one of his WALDOS

peaks out and snaps open the new locks on the door.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

OCK, in a white hospital robe walks through the surreal

debris. Two WALDOS reach out and "sense" the ripples on

opposite WALLS. He runs a hand through his hair.

He hears a NOISE behind him and reacts. And here comes

WEINER. Bedraggled, shuffling through the CONTROL ROOM

door. He eyeballs the incredible wreckage.

OCK turns, WALDOS writhing. WEINER sees them and kind of

ducks, remembering how he was hit by them once.

Suddenly OCK throws out his WALDOS from under his long

white coat, grabs WEINER and, lifts him up in the air,

smiles cynically and with cruelty!

EXT. PETER PARKER'S ROOFTOP - DAY

A CAMERA is mounted on a TRIPOD facing us. A TIMER winds

down and it CLICKS.

REVERSE ANGLE - CAMERA'S POV.

SPIDER-MAN is clinging to the side of a WALL.

The WHITE EYES narrow to a slit. CLICK.

Suddenly he spots WEINER climbing onto his roof. He

hides.

WEINER tiptoes into the roof apartment. SPIDER-MAN jumps

in and grabs him.

SPIDER-MAN throws him back onto the roof so that he almost

slides over the edge. WEINER turns, facing SPIDER-MAN.

SPIDER-MAN jumps and reaches WEINER.

SPIDER-MAN picks up WEINER, throws him up to an antenna

above the building, to which WEINER clings desperately.

SPIDER-MAN circles the antenna.

SPIDER-MAN jumps to the CHIMNEY, picks WEINER up in his

arms and whispers to him.

SPIDER-MAN jumps with WEINER in his arms to the edge of

the roof.

SPIDER-MAN drops WEINER off the roof, three floors

straight down into heavy bushes below.

INT. ELECTRODYNE FACTORY SHOP - DAY

A SIGN tells us so. A CLERK is double checking a long

list of items OCK has ordered.

CLERK

Holy cow, whattaya building, fella, a

cyclotron?

CLERK

What about the money... or do you pay by

credit card?

EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE OF A BANK - BACK DOOR - NIGHT

An ARMORED TRUCK rolls by and stops. TWO GUARDS open the

Bank's DOORS.

Suddenly a WALDO smashes through the DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW

of the ARMORED TRUCK, wrapping around the DRIVER'S NECK

and pulling him through the WINDOW. The SHOTGUN goes for

his weapon, but a WALDO smashes in and pulls the GUN out

through his WINDOW.

TWO WALDOS shoot out and attach themselves to the REAR

DOOR.

The WALDO knocks him over. OCK rips the DOOR off! The

TRUCK is full of MONEY BAGS.

INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY

A PHOTO ASSISTANT look on as JAMESON goes over PETER'S

latest PHOTOS. They are his SPIDER-MAN shots.

He tears up PETER'S SPIDEY PHOTOS.

INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

WEINER is putting on a CLOWN SUIT. He fastidiously puts

his ratty jacket on a hanger and hangs it on a PIPE. The

PIPE turns into a snake. It is, in fact, a WALDO!

A WALDO whips around WEINER'S throat... AARRRGH!

The WALDO coils tighten around WEINER'S throat.

WEINER croaks his assent.

INT. CAFETERIA - NIGHT

It is all dressed up for a party: LIGHTS, STREAMERS,

GLITTER BALL, the WORKS! HARRY is dressed as a SPACEMAN;

PETER wears his regular clothes.

LIZ is crossing the dance floor dressed as an INDIAN

PRINCESS in an MINI-DRESS.

ROZ, dressed as a COWBOY, ambles over.

PETER follows LIZ with his eyes. She takes a seat at a

TABLE next to KIM who wears a HAREM GIRL outfit with the

SALAMANDER around her neck. Next to KIM is... SPIDER-MAN!

PETER'S eyes go wide.

He hands PETER an oversized TEN GALLON HAT.

PETER and HARRY make their way through the dance floor to

the table. PETER can't take his eyes off SPIDEY.

As they take seats, PETER sees that SPIDER-MAN is trying

to read the BUGLE'S sports section by party light. KIM

waves. PETER nods and the BIG HAT falls over his face.

LIZ moves to Flash, who's dressed in the SPIDER-MAN

costume.

LIZ turns with a mild pout. Nervously, PETER ponders his

chance. HARRY nudges him.

HARRY turns to KIM and does a clanking shimmy in the SPACE

SUIT.

She reaches for HARRY'S hand.

LIZ looks. She shrugs. Then she shrieks.

PETER reacts, then looks over FLASH'S other shoulder.

INSERT: There are three PHOTOS of SPIDER-MAN in the paper.

PETER BLUSHES, smiling.

LIZ joins him provocatively.

PETER is left alone, PETER leaves toward the entrance.

At the REAR DOOR a BIG LIZARD passes a NOTE to a DALLAS

COWGIRL who passes it to a KANGAROO. The KANGAROO hops

across the dance floor to the STAGE where he hands the

NOTE to a YOUNG WOMAN in a BASEBALL UNIFORM.

She climbs the STAGE where she is bathed in a SPOTLIGHT.

She gets a DRUM ROLL from the band. There are some BOOS

as the bad stops.

FLASH, amazed turns to LIZ. He points to himself and

mouths, "Me?" (The REAL) SPIDEY drops from the ceiling and

lands in a pose. The CROWD cheers. He does a flip to LIZ

and extends a hand. The BAND starts up. LIZ demurs.

LIZ takes SPIDEY'S hand and they move slowly and sexily

onto the dance floor. They do a short simple number.

SPIDEY returns LIZ to FLASH.

FLASH takes LIZ from PETER (SPIDER-MAN).

LIZ and FLASH dance wildly. They finish to big cheers.

The real SPIDER-MAN slides to center floor. The crowd

backs away as SPIDEY spins out the greatest dance number

in film history. He's all over the floor and on the walls

and on the ceiling and on the GLITTER BALL. He takes LIZ

and flies with her. He breaks the place up. Then drops

in a pose. BIG CHEERS.

LIZ stops breathless, very near to SPIDER-MAN'S face.

He jumps away and disappears, leaving the CROWD aghast and

LIZ in love.

INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

BEN is flicking through the channels of his TV, aggravated

as usual. It's all ROCK VIDEOS!

He flicks off the set and turns to MAY who's asleep on the

couch. He gently nudges her.

It enters the EAST RIVER DRIVE.

INT. TAXI - NIGHT

As the city rolls by.

everything in sight.

A GLASS SHATTERS. AUNT MAY sits up in bed with a start.

INT. BEN AND MAY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

WEINER is going through the drawers. He finds a nice BONE

HANDLE KNIFE and pockets it.

INT. BEN AND MAY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

BEN descends the stairs from the bedroom. He peers off

into the darkness and pulls his ROBE tight around him as

if to ward off some unacknowledged danger.

EXT. TAXI - NIGHT

TAXI driving fast through STREET.

INT. TAXI - NIGHT

BANG! A BLOW OUT. The CABBIE fights the wheel to the

side of the road. Then he turns to SPIDEY.

INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

BEN comes in and looks around. A long beat. Then a

noise.

INT. BEN AND MAY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A very scared WEINER hides, eyes widening. WEINER takes

the BONE HANDLE KNIFE from his pocket. It glints in the

MOONLIGHT. He moves off.

INT. BEN AND MAY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

BEN is looking for mice. He opens a closet. Nothing. He

shifts around. Nothing. He moves off.

EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT

The CABBIE slowly changes the TIRE. Fearing the worst,

SPIDEY gets out, looking for a ride. A TRUCK approaches.

SPIDEY looks down at the CABBIE and then up at the TRUCK.

He looks up to see SPIDEY go by, stuck to the side of the

TRUCK like a spider.

EXT. THE TRUCK - NIGHT

SPIDEY stares at the lettering on the side of the TRUCK.

It says, "Victory Sporting Goods."

INT. BEN AND MAY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

BEN comes in quietly. He looks around. He opens a

closet. Nothing. He hears a CRASH. He wheels. A

SHADOWY FIGURE runs by a doorway!

BEN takes off like a shot!

INT. BEN AND MAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

BEN runs through the rooms.

INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

BEN flies in and goes right to the RIFLE on the wall. WE

hear WEINER clattering around the house in the background

as BEN goes to a drawer and pulls out a BOX of BULLETS.

He begins to fight the BULLETS into the RIFLE.

WEINER comes flying in and tackles him. They fall to the

floor, four hands on the RIFLE. They scuffle.

EXT. FOREST HILLS STREET - NIGHT

The TRUCK pulls away leaving PETER in a POOL of STREET

LAMP LIGHT. He's wearing a FOOTBALL JERSEY and SHORTS and

carrying a SPORTS BAG. He begins to run.

INT. BEN AND MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MAY hears a CRASH. She pulls the covers up around her

chin in fear.

EXT. BEN AND MAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

PETER runs up and hears a SHOT. He runs inside.

INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

PETER runs in. He sees WEINER standing there with the

RIFLE. They face off across the room. The moment hits

PETER like a punch in the chest.

PETER rushes to BEN.

PETER tries to revive BEN, while WEINER runs out.

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

PLASTIC FURNITURE, GARISH LIGHTING, CIGARETTES in the

ASHTRAYS.

AUNT MAY and PETER embrace, leaning on each other for

support.

PETER rises, nods. As AUNT MAY wipes away a sniffle...

A grim-faced DOCTOR walks slowly across the room to

them... MAY stands up slowly.

MAY collapses.

The Detective pulls PETER gently away. The STAFF works on

MAY.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

COP CARS, COPS, SEARCHLIGHTS playing their BEAMS against

the ACME CHEMICAL STORAGE BUILDING. GUNFIRE flashes from

one of the WINDOWS.

EXT. COP CAR - NIGHT

ELITE COPS in BASEBALL CAPS are plotting strategy.

COP #1 directs the BEAM of the SEARCHLIGHT.

EXT. WAREHOUSE WALL - NIGHT

SPIDER-MAN is climbing it, trapped in the GLARE of the

SEARCHLIGHT. He freezes.

EXT. COP CAR - NIGHT

Every COP'S WEAPON is trained upward at SPIDER-MAN!

EXT. WAREHOUSE WALL - NIGHT

GUNSHOTS erupt around SPIDER-MAN and he skitters around to

evade them.

INT. THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Thinking they're shooting at him, WEINER shoots back. In

the corner of his eye he sees SPIDER-MAN at a side WINDOW.

He aims his rifle and SPIDEY ducks out of the way.

The frightened WEINER moves to the side WINDOW to blow

SPIDEY away. As he moves past the front WINDOWS he is lit

by the SEARCHLIGHTS that play on his face darkly.

SPIDEY leaps in at FRONT WINDOW and drops neatly behind

WEINER, landing a pose.

WEINER whips around and fires. SPIDEY leaps to avoid it

and lands on a STACK of PAINT CANS.

SPIDEY gathers himself tighter. He leaps. A second GUN

BURST comes in behind him, Several PAINT CANS erupt in

cascades of COLOR.

WEINER aims and fires, several times. He is emptying his

RIFLE. SPIDEY leaps away and lands on the top of a CASK

marked "CAUTION-FLAMMABLE SOLVENT!"

The CASK gives way and SPIDEY is plunged into the

FLAMMABLE SOLVENT. WEINER smiles his stupid grin and

takes aim.

SPIDEY leaps out of the CASK and sticks to the roof BEAM.

He's sopping wet. His hand slips down the BEAM as the

SOLVENT works against his sticking power.

He falls to the floor and scrambles behind some PAINT

CANS. WEINER, crazed, fires wildly. One of the CANS

EXPLODES. PAINT flows from it... burning!

SPIDEY peeks out and sees a YELLOW RIVER OF FLAME creeping

toward him. He sniffs his SOLVENT soaked outfit.

He backs down a "corridor" of PAINT CANS. The YELLOW FIRE

follows, now joined by a RIVER OF BLUE FIRE from another

can. They're following the trail of SOLVENT he's

dripping!

He's trapped!

SPIDEY'S against the WALL! PAINT CANS to his right and

left, and a RIVER of RED FLAME joins the YELLOW and BLUE

as they creep toward him!

He climbs backwards up the wall, face toward the BLAZE.

The COLORED FIRES join and follow him up the wall!

They're licking at his feet!

SPIDEY is inches from being torched. He sees a PIPE. He

reaches out and grabs it. He swings out above the flames.

But the PIPE begins to bend!

The PIPE bends down... down... and then breaks! SPIDEY

hangs precariously as WATER cascades out of the PIPE and

puts out the FIRE.

SPIDEY drops down and rest his head in his hands to

collect himself. Then looks up. The GUN is at his head.

SPIDEY stands.

SPIDER-MAN hesitates. Then he begins to raise the MASK,

but stops and shakes his head no.

He reaches for the mask and SPIDER-MAN flips him across

the room. WEINER lands in a CARGO net and becomes

ensnared.

INT. WAREHOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

COPS are poised at the door. A signal. They crash

inside.

INT. WAREHOUSE PAINT ROOM - NIGHT

WEINER is hanging from the ceiling in the the CARGO NET.

He falls down, immediately encircled by the POLICE

OFFICERS. SPIDER-MAN flies above their heads, crashing

through the WINDOW and disappears into the dark of night.

INT. CYCLOTRON - NIGHT

A weird, flickering BLUE LIGHT dances around the hole in

the CYCLOTRON. Then it cuts out. A HELMETED MAN pulls

himself out of a HATCH. He flips up the HELMET.

OCK is finishing putting together his new equipment.

OCK goes about checking out the CYCLOTRON. It looks good.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

OCK starts flicking switches and reading DIALS, doing a

"mission countdown" for his next experiment. This place

has been "hot rodded" to the max.

He shuts it down. The WHINE whirs down.

OCK hides the WALDOS under his coat and leaves the room.

INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

There is more EQUIPMENT than before. PETER is deep at

work. His SPIDER-MAN UNIFORM hangs on the WALL. There is

a knock at the DOOR.

He hides his SPIDER-MAN COSTUME.

INT. THE HALLWAY LANDING - NIGHT

LIZ waits impatiently.

INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

LIZ enters, looking around. PETER covers for this and

that.

He picks up the COMPUTER and turns to her, but she's

already looking around the apartment.

LIZ walks into the room.

She discovers the PRINTS of SPIDEY that PETER has taped up

around the apartment.

PETER looks and sees that he is tethered to the wall.

Embarrassed, he puts the COMPUTER back down.

PETER leaves. LIZ smiles. She likes PETER. Why is he

so...?

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

A SHADOW of a MAN can be seen hiding. PETER does not

notice him.

INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

There's a KNOCK at the DOOR.

She is about to open the door when FOUR WALDOS smash

through it, obliterating it. OCK stands in the shattered

doorway, WALDOS writhing.

OCK shoots out TWO WALDOS. Simultaneously each grabs a

CHAIR from different parts of the room and brings them to

the TABLE.

She does. He does, too, and folds his WALDOS across his

chest.

ONE of OCK'S WALDOS rests on the TABLE curled around the

COMPUTER. LIZ lets her hand rest on it. OCK warms

immediately.

She sticks his WALDO in the ELECTRIC WALL SOCKET behind

the COMPUTER! The CURRENT sizzles through him and he

leaps up, WALDOS akimbo, like the "cartoon cat." LIZ runs

out the door.

OCK extricates himself from the current and gives chase.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

LIZ burst from the DOOR.

She looks both ways for PETER, doesn't see him, and takes

off! OCK bursts from the doorway and runs off after LIZ.

EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

LIZ running as fast as she can, but OCK is gaining

quickly.

EXT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A TAXI drives up and disgorges PETER.

INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

He walks in. It's empty

PETER springs into action. He grabs his SPIDEY SUIT out

of a drawer and starts taking off his clothes.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

LIZ looks back and sees OCK CARTWHEELING toward her. She

can't outrun him. She must hide. There's a CONSTRUCTION

SITE on the right. She ducks down the alley next to it.

INT. CONSTRUCTION ALLEY - NIGHT

LIZ runs into it and finds herself trapped on three sides

by a high CYCLONE FENCE. Behind her, OCK'S WALDOS stretch

out like waterbug legs. He bug-walks into the alley and

laughs down at her from his perch atop the WALDOS.

She dashes past him and runs into the outboard CARGO

ELEVATOR.

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

She looks for the UP BUTTON and finds nothing! OCK, on

his feet now, is on the wire mesh ELEVATOR CAGE in a

flash. He tears the outer DOOR away.

LIZ starts pressing KNOBS and LEVERS in panic. The LIGHT

goes on. A WARNING BELL clangs. She finally finds the

switch and the CAR leaps up just as OCK tears off its

front door.

LIZ, safe for the moment, watches OCK recede below,

shaking the torn off door in a rage.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

Extending WALDO over WALDO, OCK climbs the ELEVATOR

HOUSING chasing the rising CAR inside.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION ROOF - NIGHT

The CAR arrives and LIZ jumps out. She's on nothing but a

narrow GIRDER! She tightropes on the GIRDER. OCK gets to

the top. He looks across at her. She's stuck between two

unfastened GIRDERS, at a dead end. He slowly telescopes a

WALDO toward her. She's got no place to run, no place to

hide. He grabs her by the BLOUSE and lifts her off the

GIRDER.

OCK looks across the street. There, on the top of a tall

building, is SPIDER-MAN.

OCK thinks for a moment, then he begins to extend the

kicking and screaming LIZ out over the street, ten stories

up.

LIZ is having none of this. She kicks, she fights. She

twists. She flails around, making things a little worse.

The ground is yawning death beneath her. RRIIPP!

PART of her BLOUSE tears away and LIZ plummets!

SPIDER-MAN swoops down on a WEB-STRAND in his

characteristic compound curve. He reaches out for the

falling LIZ and misses her cleanly. The WEB is too short.

He THWIPS her with a second WEB and together they swing to

a HIGH GIRDER where he deposits her safe and sound.

SPIDEY THWIPS a beam and swings across toward OCK.

He lands on OCK'S GIRDER and the two progeny of the

cyclotron face off for the first time, ten stories above

the street.

A WALDO lances out and catches SPIDEY flush on the jaw.

It knocks him to another GIRDER. SPIDEY hangs on and

rolls over. He rubs his jaw.

SPIDEY gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by

another barrage of blows from above.

OCK throws a roundhouse WALDO that nearly knocks SPIDEY

off the GIRDER. He's just barely hanging on.

But SPIDER-MAN'S not done yet. He THWIPS a HIGH BEAM and

swings into a better attack position. The two SUPER-

ADVERSARIES engage in battle.

With OCK swinging from his WALDOS like a metal monkey and

SPIDEY swinging from his WEBS like, well, like SPIDEY,

they clang and bang through the GIRDERS of the

CONSTRUCTION SITE.

OCK throws his biggest punch yet.

SIRENS can now be heard in the street.

SPIDEY avoids WALDO strike after WALDO strike. OCK eludes

WEB after WEB. But SPIDEY'S agility soon has him turning

circles.

OCK takes three steps and soars through the air.

EXT. BRICK WALL - NIGHT

OCK, misjudging the leap, soars right past SPIDEY and into

an alley! Screaming all the way...

EXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT

OCK and TWO WALDOS pressed against each of the opposing

walls. It's a tenuous grip. Then, very slowly, sparks

flying from his WALDOS, OCK slides down into the alley.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

COP CARS pull up. COPS leap from them.

EXT. SIDE WALL - NIGHT

OCK makes it down, sees the COPS, ducks out of sight.

EXT. COP CARS - NIGHT

The SEARCHLIGHTS go on. SPIDER-MAN swings back across the

street to the CONSTRUCTION SITE.

EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

SPIDEY lands next to LIZ in a pose. Lit by the flashing

BILLBOARD, he's weirder looking than ever. SPIDEY puts an

arm around LIZ and extends a WEB SHOOTER.

With that SPIDEY leaps way out and he and LIZ swoop away

on a WEB-STRAND.

EXT. THE COP CARS - NIGHT

ALL WEAPONS point upward at SPIDEY'S movement.

EXT. WEB STRAND - NIGHT

SPIDEY sees the WEAPONS aimed upward. He shoots out

another WEB and swings off in a different direction. LIZ

whoops with the G-force.

He shoots out another WEB.

They are standing on the ROOF of the CENTRAL TOWER of the

EMPIRE UNIVERSITY BUILDING. LIZ opens her eyes. It's an

extraordinary sight.

EXT. DORMITORY - NIGHT

They swoop down... and down... stopping on one of the

building's SILLS, actually right in front of a WINDOW in

the DORMITORY BUILDING.

FLASH rushes right past LIZ to the WINDOW. There's a

NEWSPAPER in his hand.

He disappears. LIZ comes, tentatively, to the WINDOW

where SPIDEY squats, desire and passion in his WHITE EYES.

INT. DORM - NIGHT

FLASH comes in with more BEER than a man ought to carry.

But SPIDER-MAN has disappeared.

EXT. PETER PARKER'S ROOF - NIGHT

SPIDER-MAN lands on it. He drops in the SKYLIGHT.

INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

He drops into the room and pulls off his MASK. The place

has been ransacked. COMPUTER DISCS are all over the

floor. PETER pulls a file marked "Planetary Conjunction."

He opens it.

A piece of PAPER falls out. It says, "Kiss it goodbye,

Wall Crawler!"

EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY QUAD - DAY

PETER is hurrying along. KIM in sunning herself

wonderfully.

PETER runs off. He sees a car approach and flags it.

FLASH gets out of his car, and crosses the lawn toward

LIZ.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

OCK is hard at work. The room, still rippled, has been

"hot rodded" to the max. Lots of jerry-rigged stuff has

been added.

OCK takes a sip from the THERMOS and flicks on the small

TAPE RECORDER.

INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays Peter Parker's name

and ID number and the title, "The Planetary Conjunction

and it's effect on Earth Gravity."

INSERT: NUMBER SEQUENCES appear on the SCREEN. Then a

GRAPHIC of the EARTH moving into line with SATURN,

JUPITER, the SUN and the MOON. In the corner a NUMBER

rises.

He looks up and sees the SCREEN a GRAPHIC "HOLE" opening

up right through the EARTH! The widening HOLE is

swallowing everything!

A LARGE DIGITAL DISPLAY reads, "13:00:03." The last

seconds count down to, "12:59:59!"

He starts hitting KEYS on his COMPUTER.

INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

PETER is working on LIZ'S COMPUTER. There is a KNOCK at

his brand new, unpainted DOOR. He hurries to it and pulls

the KNOB so quickly (forgetting his own strength) that the

whole assembly comes off in his hand.

HARRY cracks his knuckles like a safe cracker and bends to

the task. The PHONE RINGS. PETER hits his jerry-rigged

SPEAKER PHONE. HARRY keeps hacking.

PETER hangs up. The DIAL TONE cuts off JAMESON.

INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Only he and the PHOTO ASSISTANT are there.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

OCK is pacing around the hot rodded room. He checks this

and that. He looks at the COUNTDOWN CLOCK (06:00:10) and

throws himself down in his CHAIR. He resumes his check-

down.

He starts flicking on SWITCHES and DIALS. The WHINE whirs

up. He throws the RED POWER THROTTLE. The POWER DIAL

goes to 90!

INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

PETER and HARRY are at a COMPUTER. The LIGHTS flicker and

dim. Then they go back on. PETER and HARRY look at each

other and shrug.

INSERT: DIGITAL CLOCK display: "06:00:03"

Another set of numbers roll up on the SCREEN. They are

accompanied by ELECTRICAL SYMBOLS.

Again, the lights flicker and then dim and they return.

HARRY/PETER

INT. BROADWAY EXPRESS - NIGHT

ROZ boards and takes a seat. There are the usual SUBWAY

TYPES. A FAT WOMAN. A PIMPLY TEENAGER and his date, a

TALL SKINNY GIRL in a PARTY DRESS.

ROZ, making notations in a PAD, takes no notice of them.

He sits down, closes his PAD, and taps a PENCIL against

his chin.

EXT. MAJOR INTERSECTION - NIGHT

TAXIS go by. TWO LOVERS stroll. We hear a familiar

WHINE. The "WALK" and "DON'T WALK" signs FLASH at the

same time.

BOY

Make up your mind!

The signs EXPLODE! The COUPLE stops in their tracks. The

BOY looks at the GIRL.

An ARC of ELECTRICITY now shoots between the LIGHT PILLARS

of the SUBWAY STATION on the corner.

INT. BROADWAY LOCAL - NIGHT

SPARKS fly by the window. ROZ, oblivious at first, is now

stunned by the show.

EXT. SUBWAY TRAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT

The ARCS of ELECTRICITY continue to rise. The STREET

LIGHTS buckle and bend into weird shapes.

EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT

TWO TAXIS roar through the intersection and COLLIDE. The

ETHNIC DRIVERS leap out and begin arguing.

INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

PEOPLE SCREAM and fall back as the TRAIN seems to change

angles.

EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

A building ROAR rises from the SUBWAY ENTRANCE. Then the

sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE! The BOY looks down the STAIRS

and has to leap out of the way as the BROADWAY EXPRESS

comes highballing up the STEPS and blasts through the

SUBWAY entrance.

The TRAIN sails through the air.

EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

The TRAIN crashes into the building in a storm of

cyclotron generated Dali physics.

EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

The THROB and PULSE recede. SCREAMS, HONKS, SIRENS can be

heard.

EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

A splendidly turned out MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN wakes from her

satin sleep to see that a SUBWAY TRAIN is in the middle of

her BEDROOM. The WALL through which the train has come

sags and ripples like it has melted and partially

resolidified.

Several PASSENGERS climb out of the WINDOWS of the TRAIN

or pry open the DOORS.

EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

A CROWD has gathered to gawk and point. They look up and

we see their POV.

The MIDDLE CAR of the TRAIN is simply "embedded" in the

HIGH-RISE, its rear sticking out of the building fifteen

stories up. From its COUPLING dangles the LAST CAR.

INT. MIDDLE CAR - NIGHT

The car is bisected in the middle by the fused brick and

glass of the WALL of the building. PASSENGERS on the

outside of the WALL press their faces to the GLASS and

pound for help.

ROZ comes to the aid of a MOTHER with TWO CHILDREN.

EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

The CROWD sees something else. Swinging high in the sky

is your friendly neighborhood SPIDER-MAN. The COUPLE and

TWO DRIVERS argue about what this means.

This is the DRIVER of a DAILY BUGLE truck carrying the

historically famous Bugle headline, "Spider-Man - Threat

or Menace?"

INT. LAST CAR - NIGHT

It's nearly vertical! People are tumbled over each other.

The scared TEENAGER is tearing at the door. The SKINNY

GIRL screams in a mechanical way. The DOOR opens. He

nearly falls!

The SKINNY GIRL screams again. He manages to get back

inside. She looks at him, safe now. But she screams

again anyway.

ROZ struggles to right himself against a pole. A BAG OF

GROCERIES goes sliding past him. It continues downward

and out the OPEN DOOR.

INSERT: The BAG tumbles down through the air. Down, down,

and down...

INT. MIDDLE CAR - NIGHT

SPIDEY'S face appears in the WINDOW upside down.

He slides the WINDOW down and flips inside. He walks

through the parting PASSENGERS to the BUILDING WALL. He

feels it.

He hurls himself at the fused GLASS portion and bounces

back onto the floor. He rolls over, flexing his shoulder.

SPIDEY does a TRIPLE FLIP to his feet. He reaches up for

the overhead RAILING and pulls it down easily. Oohs and

aahs. SPIDER-MAN points it at the GLASS and hefts it.

First the WOMAN, and then all of them, take up positions

on the BATTERING RAM.

They ram the GLASS and it shatters.

INT. THE LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

HENRY stands at the open DOOR of the TRAIN in his bedroom

as they all come rushing through into the room.

HENRY

Come on. Come on. That's it. Step

lively now.

WIFE

Henry, the rugs!

HENRY

Oh, shut up!

EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

The FIRE TRUCKS arrive and begin assembling a LADDER.

INT. THE LAST CAR - NIGHT

SPIDEY arrives at the DOOR at the top of the CAR. He sees

ROZ at the bottom. THREE PEOPLE are between them. The

SKINNY GIRL sees SPIDEY. She screams.

He scampers down the GRAB-HANDLES to the people below.

FOUR PASSENGERS cling to SEATS and BARS.

A FAT WOMAN makes a "who me?" gesture. SPIDEY throws her

over his shoulder.

INSERT: THE COUPLING which holds the two CARS at right

angles begins to bend open.

SPIDER-MAN, the FAT WOMAN over his shoulder, goes hand

over hand to the top and the WOMAN is dumped into the

MIDDLE CAR.

INSERT: THE COUPLING bends open a little more.

SPIDEY helps the TEENAGER and the SKINNY GIRL out of the

CAR. She takes the dreadful step between cars. She looks

down. She screams. She steps across.

EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

The FIRE LADDER is up. But it is about TEN FEET short of

where it's aimed at. The end of the CAR. A FIREMAN

stands at its apex.

WALKIE

Negative on that, you're at full

extension!

INT. LAST CAR - NIGHT

Now only ROZ is left. SPIDEY approaches him. He clings

to a POLE.

INSERT: The COUPLING bends open! The CAR is hanging there

from memory!

The COUPLING shrieks and the CAR lurches.

The CAR lurches on its side and ROZ flies out of the DOOR.

SPIDEY THWIPS out a WEB that girdles ROZ'S waist.

EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

ROZ is hanging in mid-air on the WEB.

ROZ shouts.

SPIDEY swings ROZ in an arc to the FIREMAN. He misses ROZ

on the first pass. ROZ looks up at SPIDEY who stands in

the doorway, manipulating the WEB.

The FIREMAN grabs ROZ. Then, with an awful SCREECH of

steel, the CAR pulls loose from the COUPLING. With

SPIDER-MAN inside it, the CAR plunges ten stories to the

street below.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

COPS, FIREMEN, PRESS, the works. The CROWD GASPS. CAMERA

STROBES pop as the LAST CAR crashes to the SIDEWALK. We

hold several beats on the incredible rubble.

Then, a WEBBED HAND. SPIDER-MAN groggily pulls himself

from the wreckage.

SPIDER-MAN shoots a WAD of WEB GOO onto the COP'S GUN and

leaps up onto the LUXURY CONDO... and swings up out of the

frame. The COP aims and shoots. The BULLET makes a

THWUMP noise. The WEB GOO stretches out about three feet

and falls limp.

EXT. BACK OF BUILDING - NIGHT

SPIDER-MAN swings painfully, one handed and limp, at the

end of a WEB STRAND. After falling ten stories, he is

groggy and weak. He can't think. He can't focus. He can

barely hold onto his WRIST GIZMOS. This bug is spent.

He hangs there with two hands to catch his breath and

thinks. He shoots a WEB up diagonally and swings across

on it. This time he catches on and holds, but barely.

INT. AUNT MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

LIZ is standing. AUNT MAY is seated on the COUCH, she

looks weak, pale and alone.

They smile knowingly at each other.

LIZ goes toward the DOOR.

EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT

SPIDER-MAN swings high above it. This is not the

confident swinger with LIZ in his arms. This is a guy

who's making it by the narrowest of margins. There is a

traffic jam below.

He looks down at the traffic. We PAN across the many CARS

until we come to a non-descript GREEN CAR.

INT. GREEN CAR - NIGHT

OCK is honking the HORN. Something lands on his ROOF.

Then SPIDEY sticks his head, upside down, in the

windshield.

A WALDO smashes through the WINDSHIELD but misses SPIDEY.

OCK leaps from the CAR.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

OCK runs through HONKING TRAFFIC. SPIDER-MAN leaps from

CAR to CAR.

OCK turns to see SPIDER-MAN leap to a LIMO at the curb.

OCK turns tail and runs down an alley. A FEMALE COP pops

out of a DOORWAY. Her partner, a BIG, YOUNG COP, pulls

his GUN.

OCK complies. He raises his hands... and spreads the

WALDOS to full extension! The BIG COP screams and faints.

The little FEMALE COP'S eyes POP. OCK swats the GUN from

her hand. He starts to choke her.

SPIDEY comes swinging to the rescue. He lands on the ROOF

nearby.

OCK leaves the COP and attacks SPIDER-MAN, shooting his

iron fist at him. OCK runs to the end of the alley.

SPIDEY staggers to his feet and resumes the chase.

OCK breaks into a red Corvette convertible, starting it

with a WALDO.

SPIDER-MAN comes out in time to see the Vette drive away.

A CHINESE LAUNDRY TRUCK is passing. SPIDEY THWIPS it and

is whipped away.

He crawls over to the WINDOW.

The surprised CHINAMAN lets loose a stream of CHINESE

expletives, complete with appropriate suggestive gestures.

SPIDER-MAN crawls to the top of the TRUCK and surveys the

situation. He sees a sea of moving traffic. He THWIPS up

a WEB and swings away.

SPIDEY swings along from BUILDING to BUILDING. The RED

VETTE is making headway. Suddenly, SPIDER-MAN spots a

blue MG with its top up.

EXT. BLUE MG - NIGHT

SPIDEY swoops down on the BLUE MG.

INT. BLUE MG - NIGHT

SPIDEY wedges down into the car, right between FLASH and

LIZ. She WHOOPS. FLASH is thrilled.

He swerves. SPIDEY falls all over LIZ. They begin to

careen through traffic, three peas in a very small pod.

EXT. WEST SIDE CAR CHASE MONTAGE - NIGHT

With SPIDEY jammed in between LIZ and FLASH, the MG chases

the VETTE. Since neither OCK nor FLASH is any good at

this, both cars quickly careen into POLES, FENCES, HOT DOG

CARS and begin falling apart.

On RIVERSIDE DRIVE the MG begins to lurch and STEAM. The

VETTE looks eaten away. The GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE

looms ahead.

The VETTE roars through the TOLL BOOTH. They spot OCK

stuck in traffic.

SPIDER-MAN jumps out of the car.

Speeding along the BRIDGE, OCK sees no one. But high

above, SPIDEY swings from TOWER to TOWER after him. At

the last TOWER, SPIDEY leaps down onto a BIG TRUCK. The

VETTE weaves and SPIDEY crosses to another BIG TRUCK. For

a moment he is caught between the TWO TRUCKS, but he makes

it across.

The VETTE takes an exit. SPIDEY leaps to the next SIGN.

He aims his WRIST GIZMO and waits for the next car to take

the exit, but none does. Deflated, he drops to the

ground. He looks up to see a sign on a CYCLONE FENCE. It

says, "DUMP NUMBER 7 -- KEEP OUT -- RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!"

INT. TOXIC WASTE DUMP - NIGHT

The landscape has a nightmarish vision, weirdly lit by

"safety lights." VATS and DRUMS ooze all kinds of bad

stuff. A light is on in a dilapidated SHACK.

INT. THE SHACK - NIGHT

OCK is tossing away the CANISTERS until he comes to one

marked, "HAZARD!! PLUTONIUM SL 270 HAZARD!!"

SPIDEY'S peering in from a HOLE in the ROOF.

OCK hurls a DRUM at SPIDEY. It erupts in a sizzle of

LIQUID and GAS. Then the SIX-ARMED FIEND runs for the

door with his SL 270.

EXT. THE SHACK - NIGHT

OCK comes flying out and SPIDER-MAN grabs a WALDO.

SPIDEY does a back flip and whips OCK so hard the WALDO

snaps off! OCK recoils it and reacts in horror.

With a roar, OCK attacks SPIDER-MAN. They battle as

SUPER-ADVERSARIES. OCK gains the upper hand and tosses

SPIDEY into a pile of RUSTING DRUMS. A GAS envelopes

SPIDER-MAN and he begins coughing.

EXT. THE DUMP - NIGHT

OCK'S WALDOS are coiled around SPIDER-MAN'S neck as the

WEB SLINGER is dragged through the dump. His WHITE EYES

narrow and blink. There is a capped WELL behind a WARNING

SIGN. OCK tears off the CAP and then hurls the groggy

SPIDEY down the WELL.

INT. THE WELL - NIGHT

SPIDEY falls. He cannot grab onto the slimy WALLS. At

the bottom of the foul pit is a bubbling BLUE luminescent

POOL. SPIDEY claws frantically at the WALLS.

He gets a hold and slides down to within a foot of the

POOL. Its weird light shines up at him. He looks up at

the starry sky.

He shoots a WEB about halfway up the PIT. It hits the

wall, sizzles, and drops back down.

The WEB GIZMO squirts out a pathetic patooey of WEB GOO.

Then it hisses, empty!

SPIDEY reaches out.

OCK, way up at the opening above, raises a huge DRUM above

his head. The DRUM leaks toxic waste in ORANGE TENDRILS.

He is about to drop it down on SPIDER-MAN...

We now see FLASH and LIZ in the BLUE MG.

Suddenly he catches FLASH with a WALDO and starts to choke

him. LIZ screams and tries to help FLASH.

Another WALDO grabs her.

ROZ now appears on the scene.

Another WALDO grabs ROZ by his arm.

Both FLASH and LIZ shake their heads okey dokey. OCK

gestures to FLASH and LIZ.

OCK pushes FLASH and LIZ with his iron arm. Gripping LIZ

be her hair, he shoves her into the CAR.

ROSOMORF finds a rope and looks into the well.

INT. ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT

They drive along the highway. SPIDEY is recovering,

working his neck.

They're in the middle of RIVERSIDE DRIVE but a PHONE BOOTH

is coming up on the right.

INSERT: ROZ'S foot stabs the BRAKE.

INT. ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT

SPIDEY gets out of the car. Then he pats himself where

his pockets ought to be.

INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

HARRY is there, working on the COMPUTER, PHONE RINGS,

HARRY picks up.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays a graphic of the SUN,

EARTH, and MOON lining up with JUPITER and SATURN.

EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT

The BLUE MG arrives and comes to a stop. OCK looks at his

two prisoners in the back seat and smiles to himself...

Picks up one DRUM on each shoulder.

OCK leaves. LIZ and FLASH are tied together in the back

seat of the CAR.

INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT

Professor OCK comes for some more drums. He sees that LIZ

and FLASH have disappeared. OCK picks up TWO DRUMS.

HARRY seeing FLASH and LIZ come running to the school

grounds.

INT. COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT

The LIGHTS are off, but the COMPUTERS are on. HARRY looks

over LIZ'S shoulder as she cracks through a code. Her

SCREEN reads out, "CONNECTICUT. TECH. Fully Op, Line

Backlog, Security Max Level." The last line is FLASHING.

They all run from COMPUTER to COMPUTER.

HARRY types in KARNAKY LTD and gets the same response. He

looks at his DIGITAL WRISTWATCH. "01:00:02" becomes

"00:59:59" as we watch. Then a WARNING BUZZER!

HARRY hurries to KIM'S side and elbows her out of the

CHAIR. The SCREEN is flashing "WARNING, Security Breach!"

HARRY'S hands fly over the keys. The KIDS gather around.

LINE DRAWINGS of the CYCLOTRON (progressing from large to

small detail) appear one after the other. Finally, a

PIPE. There is a CIRCLE around a JOINT. And the legend

"H20".

Suddenly the lights dim. A heavy noise. An earth quake.

EXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK

The EARTH is moving into line with the other PLANETS of

the CONJUNCTION.

EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

HARRY and FLASH and LIZ and KIM, (the EARTH is SHAKING)

come out running from the building beneath an enormous

HANGING MOON. They are frightened.

Suddenly it all stops. It's quiet, the kids look at the

sky.

We now see the sky. With the sun on one side, and the

moon on the other. They watch it, shocked, frightened out

of their wits.

EXT. END OF THE WORLD MONTAGE - NIGHT

Suddenly from OCK'S basement lab a BLUE BEAM of LIGHT

breaks through. A WHINE starts, it moves magically out of

the WINDOW and PANS around a sleepy NEW YORK which doesn't

know that the end is upon it. The dreaded WHINE builds

throughout! People stop in their tracks, look up to the

strange looking skyline. Camera comes down to a street

where ROZ is DRIVING SPIDER-MAN fast toward the

UNIVERSITY.

INT. ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT

ROZ looks out over the skyline of NEW YORK. Lighted

buildings FLARE UP and then GO DARK. The LIGHTED SPIRE of

the Empire State Building FLARES UP and EXPLODES.

They look across the campus and a strange LIGHT is coming

out of the SCIENCE CENTER.

SPIDER-MAN massages his arm.

SPIDER-MAN SHOOTS out a WEB and flies toward the SCHOOL

BUILDING taking ROZ with him.

INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

It is a patchwork of make-shift repairs. OCK looks in

through a WINDOW that's been melted out. He is lost in a

mad rapture.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

RED POWER THROTTLE is at 95% POWER!

SPIDER-MAN and ROZ enter, shielding their eyes from the

GLARE. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:08:18".

ROZ flings himself through the MELTED WINDOW into the

EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER. He grabs for the "BULLET" but the

WALDOS grab him and throw him back. ROZ staggers

backward... into the arms of SPIDER-MAN.

SPIDER-MAN attacks OCK, trying to push him away from the

THROTTLE. OCK pushes SPIDER-MAN away from him so strongly

that SPIDER-MAN is knocked down. OCK nudges the POWER

THROTTLE forward and the WHINE increases to an ear

shattering pitch. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:06:48".

We are at 96% POWER!

EXT. THE SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

We PAN down from the MOON to a STREET full of SIRENS and

SHADOWY FIGURES running in the night. LIZ and KIM and

HARRY come nearer. A very WEIRD light is emanating from

the CENTER.

INT. THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The PLANETS are playing on the COMPUTER SCREEN. Things in

the room begin to rise, weightless. The ENERGY STORM is

brewing!

EXT. THE SKY - STRANGE COLORS - NIGHT

The CONJUNCTION is now happening.

INSERT: Surreal DIALS spin madly.

INT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

LIZ runs into a HALLWAY gone berserk. Stuff is flying

everywhere. TILES pull from the WALLS and crash to the

ceiling.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

OCK throws the RED POWER THROTTLE to 97% POWER.

Cacophony! The "BULLET" begins to PULSE and THROB! The

DIALS spin! The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:05:58".

EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

The FULL MOON hangs over the building. FLASH and HARRY

and KIM stand at the entrance to the CENTER.

FLASH starts to run to the building.

They run forward but as they reach the FRONT STEPS the

building lurches upward. The bottom step becomes a wall

of STONE and DIRT, six feet high.

Then the building lurches upward again! This time it

pulls FREE from the ground. The KIDS take cover as WATER

LINES BURST and ELECTRICAL WIRES SPARK.

INT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - NIGHT

LIZ opens a door.

The building lurches throwing her back across the HALL

where she crashes through another door.

INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT

All manner of stuff is flying around. LIZ comes sliding

across the floor. She crashes into a CABINET. GLASSWARE

starts to fall on her, but crashes into the CEILING

instead. She is dragged up the WALL. She kicks and

screams against the Anti-Force.

EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

FLASH, KIM and HARRY look on as heavy ELECTRICAL CABLES

stretch upward to the rising CENTER and then snap in

showers of sparks. As they fall away the CENTER becomes

airborne. The CABLES wave up at it, shooting arcs of

ELECTRICITY directly at the building.

INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT

LIZ slides down the WALL. She grabs at the WINDOW and

looks out. The rest of the university recedes beneath

her, now a hundred feet below. And they're still rising!

FLASH and HARRY look up.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

People look up at the SCIENCE CENTER. A CYCLIST, riding

and looking, crashes into a TAXI. MAX REISS leaps out

with the BEAUTIFUL STARLET from the TAXI.

INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

He's looking out his window seeing the University's Lab

Building flying by. Up and up toward the sky.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

A very long shot of the SCIENCE CENTER rising into the

CLOUDS.

INT. AUNT MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

She pulls aside a CURTAIN and watches the SCIENCE CENTER

rise.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

OCK works the COMPUTER as the CONSOLE sends up SHOWERS of

SPARKS. He glances at the "BULLET" which now PULSES.

The COUNTDOWN CLOCK at "00:04:18".

A WALDO reaches in and rips ROZ off SPIDEY, flinging him

back against a WALL. ROZ lands in a heap beneath a FIRE

STATION (HOSE, EXTINGUISHER, AXE).

We see the WALDO reach out for SPIDER-MAN. It wraps

around his FOOT and begins to tug, slowly...

OCK knocks SPIDER-MAN with a real BIG BLOW with his WALDO.

OCK is slowly dragging SPIDER-MAN to a HUGE HOLE that's

been ripped in the floor by the BEAMS of ELECTRICITY.

We see New York a half a mile down through the hole. We

see SPIDEY being drawn across the HOLE. Then ROZ comes

flying in with the FIRE AXE.

ROZ hacks away at the WALDO and chops it off! The stump

withdraws. OCK examines it in pain and fury!

ROZ doesn't even look back. He and SPIDEY are at the edge

of the HOLE and he's shaking SPIDEY furiously.

OCK sends out his other WALDO and begins banging it on the

floor in a frenzy on either side of ROZ and SPIDEY. Like

a child denied, he smashes his steel fists against the

floor again and again.

SPIDEY grabs hold of the edge and dangles. He looks down

and sees ROZ falling away beneath him, disappearing into

the dark.

EXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK

The PLANETS are virtually in line!

INT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - NIGHT

LIZ comes running through it. A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY

shoots from the right to the left in front of her. She

slams on the brakes and runs the other way.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at, "00:02:59". OCK throws the

POWER THROTTLE to 98% POWER. He laughs and a WEB splats

against his GLASSES. SPIDEY scrambles to his feet. OCK,

still trying to get the WEB GOO off his GLASSES, is

slammed into the CONSOLE by SPIDER-MAN. SPARKS fly and

WALDOS flail blindly, smashing things. OCK tears off his

GLASSES and squints through the FIRE and SMOKE and GLARE.

SPIDER-MAN THWIPS the ceiling and swings into a drop kick!

OCK recovers. He grabs SPIDEY and slam dunks him through

the hole in the floor.

EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE BUILDING - NIGHT

SPIDER-MAN falls through the air. He shoots up a WEB and

THWIPS, it sticks to the ROCKY bottom of the FOUNDATION.

OCK appears in the HOLE. He sees SPIDEY'S dilemma,

hanging on a thread of WEB. A half-broken WALDO snakes

down and CLIPS the WEB.

But the WEB sticks to the WALDO! OCK shakes it, but he

can't get loose. SPIDER-MAN shoots out another WEB at the

ROCK BOTTOM and, with the leverage, he pulls OCK out.

OCK swings down in a wide arc and his WALDOS catch on the

ROCK upside down. He holds on fiercely.

OCK scrambles out to the side of the CENTER and begins

looking for an entry. SPIDER-MAN is right on his tail.

The building pitches sideways! OCK turns to face SPIDER-

MAN, his broken WALDOS out for BATTLE.

SPIDEY grabs an EXPOSED PIPE and breaks it off,

brandishing it like a broad sword.

Now the CENTER pitches to a 45 degree angle. They DUEL

upside down! A WINDOW GRATE crashes open and LIZ comes

flying out, holding onto the GRATE for dear life!

SPIDER-MAN uses his great strength to move a HUGE PIECE of

SCIENTIFIC MACHINERY in front of the GRATE.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at, "00:01:00" as SPIDEY comes

flying in with LIZ in tow.

LIZ looks at some WIRING, apprehensive about even touching

it.

She yanks out a CABLE. The building pitches. But when

SPIDEY pulls one out, it rights itself.

EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

The BIG BEAMS start cutting out one by one. The CENTER

begins to PITCH and YAW. The CHOPPERS are getting closer.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:00:15" as SPIDEY and LIZ

continue to pull WIRES and CABLES. TWO WALDOS erupt

through the floor and grab SPIDEY. They pull SPIDEY to

the floor. Entangled in these molybdimum pythons, SPIDEY

struggles valiantly. LIZ leaps to his aid.

A third WALDO, a broken one, snakes up from the HOLE and

begins feeling blindly around on the CONSOLE for the POWER

THROTTLE.

LIZ sees the damaged WALDOS heading for the RED THROTTLE.

The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at "00:00:10". LIZ leaps and tries

to wrestle it away. It whips in her arms and she holds on

tight. It bangs her against the wall and then the

CONSOLE. She holds on. "00:00:03". The WALDO crashes

LIZ against the wall which erupts in SPARKS. She lets go

of it. It heads for the POWER THROTTLE! "00:00:01!"

SPIDER-MAN can't break the grip of the WALDOS, but he can

pull with super-human strength. He yanks OCK up through

the STONE floor. OCK hits the ceiling of the CONTROL

ROOM. ONE WALDO grabs on. The other one throws the RED

POWER THROTTLE!

The UNIVERSAL BULLET begins to GLOW. The GLOW sharpens to

a POINT of LIGHT. SPIDER-MAN holds on tight against a

rushing ENERGY FLOW that's pulling everything in the room

towards the POINT of LIGHT.

LIZ starts to slip away into the flow. She struggles

against it.

SPIDEY THWIPS her and she grabs onto the WEB.

OCK drops calmly, beatifically, to the floor of the room.

He moves slowly, under his own power, into the LIGHT.

As he nears the LIGHT he actually becomes a part of it.

He radiates LIGHT. He shimmers and shines. He fills the

room with BLINDING LIGHT.

SPIDEY and LIZ shield their eyes, and as the light

diminishes, the storm subsides. They're safe. Except for

the fact that they're in a floating building, 10,000 feet

above the city!

EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

Against the backdrop of the MOON, a SQUADRON of

HELICOPTERS approaches the CENTER. From their POV, a HUGE

CRACK opens across the face of the building. The CENTER

begins to drop in PULSING SURGES.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

SPIDER-MAN is at the CONSOLE pulling and putting back

WIRES. LIZ, fascinated, looks in at the WINDOW where OCK

disappeared.

EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT

It rotates and drops. The HELICOPTERS come in like the

cavalry.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

Trying to leave it, LIZ and SPIDEY are confronted with a

nightmare. The room is tilted at a 45% angle. PIPES are

bursting. SPIDEY helps LIZ through the obstacles. Debris

rains down. They come face to face with a diagonal maze

of PIPES.

A HUGE CRACK opens above them.

They scale the maze, but as they emerge on the other side,

half the floor falls away! Central Park awaits, 8,000

feet below.

He looks across at the door. It is midway up a diagonal

wall. He shoots a WEB up at the ceiling between

themselves and the door. Then he extends a hand to LIZ.

He swings across and lands on the LEDGE of the DOOR. Then

he swings the WEB back to her like a trapeze.

LIZ catches the WEB and looks across at SPIDER-MAN,

furious.

LIZ swings across like TARZAN and SPIDEY gathers her in on

the LEDGE. She does a comic "phew" and the LEDGE buckles

beneath them but holds. SPIDER-MAN tries to open the

door, but it's stuck.

SPIDER-MAN bends his back to the task. It take all his

strength, but with a comic AAAAARGGHH! He bends the DOOR

open.

EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

They burst out onto the ROCK FOUNDATION of the building.

New York is rushing up to meet them. The WIND created by

their fall buffets them. The HELICOPTERS arrive, and the

falling building plunges right past them. The HELICOPTERS

look across at each other, helpless.

EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT

It drops like a stone.

EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

SPIDEY and LIZ are falling away from the DOOR, sliding

along the ROCK. LIZ is stopped by a RETAINING WALL.

SPIDEY keeps sliding. He THWIPS the wall and then

disappears over the edge. LIZ screams!

LIZ fights to her feet and grabs onto the WEB STAND. She

pulls on it with all her strength. She pulls and pulls

and pulls. We see the WEB running up between the ROCKS.

She gives one last pull and comes up with an EMPTY WEB

END.

A long, long beat.

LIZ looks up and sees PETER hanging out the WINDOW two

stories above her. He throws out a ROPE LADDER. LIZ

grabs it. She begins to climb.

INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT

PETER pulls LIZ through the WINDOW. There is no time for

an embrace.

They run out of the ROOM. We PAN down and see, crumpled

beneath the WINDOW, the SPIDER-MAN suit.

INT. LARGE PHYSICS LAB - NIGHT

This is the LAB we saw in the opening sequence. PETER has

turned on the lights. He's got a handful of ROPE.

We are looking at the HUGE AMERICAN FLAG.

EXT. THE FOUNDATION - NIGHT

LIZ is already down the ROPE LADDER and is holding it for

PETER. He comes down with a HUGE bundle of RED, WHITE &

BLUE.

He ties some ROPE around her waist.

They move to the edge of the ROCK and look down. CENTRAL

PARK is still a couple thousand feet down.

They SCREAM as the building lurches again, knocking them

to the ground. They start to slide across the ROCK. They

reach out for each other but their hands don't quite

reach.

Slowly, they inch back together, but the FOUNDATION cracks

between them.

EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT

It spins and falls beneath us. Down, down it goes. And

then it crashes into the GREAT LAWN. A huge cloud of

debris shoots upward.

EXT. THE SKY - NIGHT

There is a beautiful FULL MOON. PETER and LIZ float down

into the frame lit by its wonderful light.

The AMERICAN FLAG which has turned into a huge parachute.

They hold each other tight. They can hear SIRENS below.

They begin to laugh with relief. Then they stop. The

wind billows LIZ'S skirt and plays with PETER'S hair, and

snaps in the AMERICAN FLAG.

They land in the center of the park under the parachute.

They stay there and kiss... completely covered by the

flag. Camera pulls up to show the building floating away.

THE END
