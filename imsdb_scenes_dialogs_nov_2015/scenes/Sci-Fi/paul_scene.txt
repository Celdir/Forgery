EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming 10:19pm 28/07/47

The air is filled with the sounds of a warm, summer night. A

light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window. The door opens, a small

dog and a young girl emerge.

Go on now Paul, don't be long.

The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch.

The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing

the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low

humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow

reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers

Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground,

bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange

glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness.

Paul... Paul?

The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow.

Paul?!

The glow fades again.

MUSIC: "The Boy In The Bubble" by Paul Simon.

EXT. SAN DIEGO STREET. PRESENT - DAY

GRAHAM WILLY (32) and CLIVE GOLLINGS (33) stand in the

blazing San Diego sunshine, waiting to cross the road. GRAHAM

is thin but his clothes seem too small. He has long greasy

hair, buck teeth and thick glasses. CLIVE is bigger and wears

a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots. His

hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid.

Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by. GRAHAM

and CLIVE shrug derisively. The cross-walk beeps.

As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the

road towards the San Diego Convention Centre. They make their

way through a throng of costumed Comic-Con attendees.

INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. CONVENTION FLOOR - LATER

GRAHAM and CLIVE are at a fantasy weapons stand. CLIVE is

brandishing a KATANA SWORD. He test the balance, the weight,

the sharpness. He closes one eye and looks down the length of

the blade. He nods appreciatively.

2.

Beautiful piece.

Damn straight. Practical

performance. 100% Japanese, folded

steel. Real hero shit.

How much?

$1,349.99.

CLIVE nods, puts the sword down and walks away.

Aren't you gonna get it?

No, it's rubbish.

INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY

We see them on an escalator, walking down a wide corridor,

passing people in a variety of costumes. Finally, they join a

line of people waiting to meet the actor, MICHAEL BIEHN.

What are you going to ask?

Do you feel that the killing of

Hicks and Newt in Alien 3,

invalidates Ripley's struggle at

the closed of the previous

installment?

I was going to ask that!

Tough tits four eyes.

Alright, next!

Suddenly nervous, GRAHAM approaches. MICHAEL BIEHN is signing

pictures. He is pleasant, if business like.

Hey there. Who's it to?

Graham.

3.

Graham.

Uh... are you... did you?

There you go.

SECURITY moves GRAHAM on. CLIVE approaches.

Hey there. Who's it to?

Clive.

Clive.

Uh... are you... did you?

There you go.

SECURITY moves CLIVE on. CLIVE scrambles for his camera.

I... I need to photograph him.

You can take it from there.

CLIVE and GRAHAM huddle together and try to position

themselves with MICHAEL BIEHN in the background. CLIVE takes

the shot. We see a frozen image of CLIVE and GRAHAM, with

MICHAEL BIEHN barely visible in the background. The pair move

off, looking at their spoils.

YES!

That was amazing. I was actually a

bit nervous.

Really? I wasn't.

Good egg, wasn't he?

Yes, very unaffected. Damn, I

forgot to give him my card.

CLIVE points at SECURITY.

4.

Give it to Colossus.

Nah. Hey, Rosario Dawson's here!

She NEEDS to call me.

INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER

GRAHAM and CLIVE sit at a table fiddling nervously with pens.

On either side of them are stacks of their new book; JELVA -

ALIEN QUEEN OF THE VARVAK. A banner hangs behind, displaying

the tome's cover, a muscular green woman in a gold bikini

rides a blue rhino. She lashes at the beast with a laser

whip. She has three tits. A lanky publicist paces up and

down, making sure everything is in order.

Looks good, right?

Yes, it's very impressive.

It really does the image justice. I

never noticed the third tit.

That was Graham's idea.

Ladies man, huh? You guys happy?

You got enough pens? You wanna

Snapple? You wanna a Diet Coke?

I'll have a fat Coke please?

A fat what?

Coke.

Oh you man a FAT Coke.

A what?

Fat coke.

Yes please.

5.

When do we start?

Ten minutes ago.

Why is it so quiet?

Sylar's doing a Q and A in the main

pavillion.

Oh man! I wanted to go to that . I

wanted to find out if he actually

eats the brains.

I can make a call.

Please.

It'll pick up when he's done.

I'm nervous.

Don't be. The hard work's done, we

have a great story and as usual

your renderings jump from the page.

Yeah man. Three tits. Awesome.

Thank you.

All we have to do now is sit back

and enjoy.

A child approaches.

Queen Jelva welcomes thee.

Do you know where Sylar's on?

Main pavillion.

Thanks. Hey, three tits. Awesome.

6.

INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER

Caption: 50 MINUTES LATER

They are sat in exactly the same position as before. CLIVE

looks a little downbeat, GRAHAM fidgets with his pens.

Okay, that's the hour. How'd we do?

Three copies.

Hey, one for each tit. Maybe you

should have given her four.

That's sick.

Don't sweat it. It's a sleeper.

Yeah, but three copies?

Better than Carl Weathers.

YES!

Would you like a copy?

Are you nuts? My office is full of

junk.

The PUBLICIST walks away chuckling.

Graham, I need a drink.

INT. HOTEL. BAR - NIGHT

GRAHAM and CLIVE are stood against the wall in a bar. GRAHAM

drinks and elaborate blue cocktail through a straw. CLIVE

sips from a Jack Daniels and Coke. Everyone else in the bar

is dressed as a HOBBIT. CLIVE winks at a girl.

7.

INT. HOTEL. BEDROOM - NIGHT

GRAHAM and CLIVE's hotel room is filled with bags of stuff

from the convention, a laptop computer and a games console

plugged into the TV. GRAHAM lies on his bed. He is looking at

a map. Other maps are scattered about.

CLIVE (O.S.)

It was like the Prancing Pony in

there.

Nasty Hobbitses.

CLIVE emerges from the bathroom. He is naked but for a black

towel wrapped around his waist. His hair is wet and suddenly

incredibly long. Around his neck, a large animal tooth hangs

on a black leather cord.

They think they're so cool.

Hey, are you excited about going to

Area 51?

Hell yes.

06.30 check out?

A-ffirmative.

GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches.

Three, two, one...

Beep. Beep.

Good night, Graham.

Good night, Clive.

They switch off their respective bedside lights. The room is

plunged into pitch darkness. A few seconds pass.

Are you asleep?

No.

8.

Shall we try and storm the Citadel

before we nod off?

Couldn't hurt could it?

We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV.

The boys lie on their beds holding games controllers.

Cover me.

INT. HOTEL. RECEPTION - MORNING

GRAHAM and CLIVE stand at reception. Both look extremely

sleepy. CLIVE's eyes close. GRAHAM lolls forward onto the

reception desk. His head hits the bell.

DING!

EXT. HOTEL - MORNING

The boys stand, waiting for their transport. We see them from

across the road. A tiny old car splutters up to the curb. A

valet gets out and hands the keys to CLIVE.

There you go.

That's not ours.

No?

No, that's ours.

A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of

the range in its day. Still looks good.

Oh.

GRAHAM and CLIVE run off toward the RV. The four BORG from

the previous day approach the VALET and exchange the key to

the car for some small change. The BORG drive off.

Fucking Borg.

(giving the finger)

Assimilate this!

The RV speeds past the disgruntled VALET. GRAHAM and CLIVE

can be heard whooping within.

9.

INT. RV - MORNING

CLIVE is seated behind the wheel of their RV, he now wears

black wrap-around shades. In the back of the RV, GRAHAM

fusses with maps and provisions.

Breakfast?

Java. Straight up.

Any solids?

No, let's punch through. Miles make

the eggs taste sweeter.

I love eggs!

I hear that. Now, get that " Joe' on

the go and jump in the Chewie seat.

I need your map skills.

Good job I pre-pared.

GRAHAM flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co-pilot's

(Chewie) seat.

It's a shame I don't have some

controls on this side. That way, I

could take over if you needed the

loo.

Yeah, I could say "take the helm."

"Take the helm, number one."

Yeah, "take the helm, number one, I

need a number two."

They laugh heartily. Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out

his laptop and setting it up on the dash board.

" Least I've got Cerebro, eh?

10.

Absolutely. Real-time sat-nav multi

map and advanced geo-tagging with

continual info stream?

Impressive.

Most impressive.

And let's not forget, we've always

got Analogue.

GRAHAM pulls a map down. Obscuring the entire windshield.

Not when we're driving Graham.

Sorry.

GRAHAM sends the map back up into the roller. The coffee

percolator gurgles in the galley.

Sounds like coffee o'clock.

Thank god. I'm a wreck until I've

had my first cup of J.

GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen.

INT. DINER - DAY

GRAHAM and CLIVE eat lunch. GRAHAM has finished a plate of

prawns. He inspects the shells.

Looks like a pile of dead droids.

A perky waitress approaches. GRAHAM and CLIVE become shy and

awkward.

You boys all set? Can I get you

anything else?

GRAHAM spills his drink. CLIVE appears very uneasy.

INT/EXT. RV - DAY

They drive in silence, surveying the landscape.

11.

Amazing, isn't it? There are

295,734,134 people in this country

and we haven't seen a soul for a

hundred miles. Where is everybody?

What about that old woman on

crutches we saw hitchhiking?

Apart from her. I suppose that's

why they established the Dreamland

facility out here.

Far from prying eyes.

Did you know the site was selected

in the mid-1950s for testing of the

U-2 spyplane, due to its

remoteness, proximity to existing

facilities and presence of a dry

lake bad for landings?

Yes.

Oh.

Shall we have a bite before or

after we hit the Black Mailbox?

Before.

INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING

GRAHAM and CLIVE tuck into burgers. They are the only

customers. The interior is replete with various Area 51

related memorabilia. PAT, (female, 50s) the proprietor,

speaks to them from behind the counter. She holds up two

bumper stickers.

"Watch The Skies" or "Alien

Onboard?"

GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other for a few seconds before

looking back at PAT.

"Alien Onboard."

12.

Nice choice. So, where have you

boys come from?

San Diego.

Comic-Con?

How could you tell?

We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like

the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever.

Just a guess. My nephew launched a

comic down there a couple of years

ago. Sort of dramatized the

accounts of some of the folk we've

had in here.

Encounter Briefs?

That's it. You heard of it, huh?

I've got all six.

Well whaddya know? Small world.

Do you get a lot of UFO types round

here?

We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien

paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face.

Some.

Have you ever seen one?

A UFO? Oh, I've seen plenty.

Really?! You've seen more than one

UFOs?

13.

Well, I don't know what they were.

So as far as I'm concerned they're

unidentified and they were

definitely flying.

And objects.

Damn straight. Whether or not they

were spaceships, I can't say.

Probably not, but I'd like to think

they were. Be a shame if we were

the only souls in the universe.

Did you now, it's estimated that

there are as many as 200 billion

galaxies in the observable universe

and each of those has approximately

40 billion starts, around which

orbit countless planets and moons?

Yes.

Oh.

Makes you think though, don't it?

What?

Where is everybody?

GRAHAM and CLIVE ponder this.

You boys all set?

I'd like a cup of coffee please.

Sure thing. How about you, sugar?

Can I have an E.T. malt please?

You wanna sparkler in that?

GRAHAM smiles coyly.

14.

I'll take that as a yes.

She beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen. GRAHAM

and CLIVE are left alone. They take it all in.

It's nice here, isn't it?

Absolutely.

I think I might use the loo.

CLIVE walks through a door marked " Maliens'. The adjacent

toilet door (GUS and JAKE) enter. GRAHAM becomes uneasy.

Yes dear, what can I get you?

Two beers.

Coming right up.

INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. TOILET - EVENING

CLIVE washes his hands. He pumps soap from a dispenser which

is shaped like an alien's head, the soap squirts out of its

mouth. CLIVE is quite taken with this.

That is absolutely amazing!

INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING

CLIVE appears out of the toilet with his hands in the air.

Hey Graham, an alien just sicked up

into my palms.

CLIVE doesn't see the two men sat up at the counter. He

strides over to GRAHAM, full of excitement.

I'm joking, of course. They have a

soap dispenser, shaped like an

alien's head. When you pump his

jaw, soap comes out of his mouth.

Clive...

15.

It's hilarious.

GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter.

What?

CLIVE looks over and sees the two men. They are glaring back.

CLIVE immediately loses his confident air.

PAT (O.S.)

Here it comes!

GRAHAM closes his yes, remembering what he ordered. The two

men turn to see PAT emerge from the kitchen with a tray of

drinks. Two bottles of beer, one cup of coffee and an absurd

looking milkshake in a tall glass with a sparkler.

Okay then, beers for you gentleman.

A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt

with a sparkler for the boys from

outer space.

The man snigger derisively. PAT senses the tension.

So, where you boys headed?

We're heading into Utah. Do

ourselves some hunting.

Deer, coon, beaver, whatever steps

in front of the bangstick, right

Jake?

They throw a look back at GRAHAM and CLIVE.

You got that right, Gus.

Well now, I heard Utah beaver puts

up quite a fight.

That's what we're counting on.

They nudge each other and laugh.

I better make you something good

and hot. Long way to The Beehive.

PAT give GRAHAM and CLIVE a look. CLIVE understands and

fumbles for hi wallet.

16.

He places a number of bills on the table. They leave. GRAHAM

comes back in and retrieves the bumper sticker. PAT gives him

a wink. He leaves.

INT/EXT. RV - EVENING

GRAHAM boards the RV. CLIVE is in the driver's seat. The

engine is running.

What took you so long?

I was putting the sticker on.

They were an odd pair, weren't

they?

Definitely didn't speak Bocci.

CLIVE fires up the engine and jams it into reverse. CRUNCH.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)

That wasn't their truck was it?

No.

EXT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN - EVENING

The RV roars off, leaving the car park and the black Lincoln

Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.

INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT

GRAHAM looks at a map. CLIVE drives, continually checking his

rear view.

What's the matter?

Nothing. How we doing?

We should be just about there.

They scan the roadside for a few seconds.

I've found it.

Where?

17.

THERE!!!

EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The RV comes to a screeching halt. It sits in the road for a

moment, before it trundles onto the hard shoulder. The door

opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE appear wearing head mounted torches.

They wander over to a WHITE mailbox.

The Black Mailbox.

GRAHAM and CLIVE marvel at it. The silence of the night and

the size of the landscape dawns on them. They look up.

It's amazing, isn't it? We're

actually here.

Area 51.

Dreamland.

The Groom Lake Military Test

Facility.

MacArthur's Black Mile.

Is that a real one?

No, I made it up myself.

I like it.

Be great if we saw something.

Yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by

a craft.

That would be incredible. It just

sort of stops in the air and hovers

then just goes up really fast.

Whoosh.

18.

What would you do if they actually

landed?

Keep it together. First contact is

a big responsibility. They come in

peace, we go to pieces? That's not

how I roll.

CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed.

What's wrong?

GRAHAM points off into the distance. HEADLIGHTS.

It's them. They found us. I don't

know how but they found us.

Who? Who's found us?

The Libyans!

Run for it Marty!

GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV.

INT. RV - NIGHT

CLIVE drives, GRAHAM looks nervous. In the dashboard of the

RV is a rear view monitor. They look at it intently.

Perhaps it's not them. Perhaps

whoever it was turned doff.

Of course it's them. We're dead.

It's like Deliverance. They're

going to rape us and break our

arms.

I don't want my arms broken!

There's only one thing for it.

What?

I'm gonna have to fly blind.

19.

CLIVE kills the headlights. They are plunged into darkness,

still travelling at 65mph. The headlights come back on.

Probably best not to do that. I

couldn't really see anything.

They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of

the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible.

Oh God, oh God, oh God.

I need the toilet.

Me too.

The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake.

They're trying to overtake.

Don't let them get past.

Should I ram them?

What about the deposit?

CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A

BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to

avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes

widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times,

bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on

its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks.

It wasn't them.

The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and

CLIVE peer out of the window.

We should see if they're okay.

I still need a wee.

I can hold mine.

GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE

remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled

Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears.

20.

The bulb's gone in there.

EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

GRAHAM and CLIVE step out of the RV and approach the car.

Inside are three unconscious men. One door is open.

Hello?

They wait for a few seconds. Nothing.

Maybe you should call for help.

GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial.

VOICE (O.S.)

I wouldn't do that if I were you.

GRAHAM and CLIVE spin round to see an indistinct figure

sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness. The glow of a

cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large,

black eyes. GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp.

I rather think these men need help.

Graham, give me the phone.

GRAHAM passes the phone over.

Seriously, I wouldn't do that.

GRAHAM's mouth falls open, CLIVE continues to hold the phone

to his ear. We hear the operator.

911 Emergency. How may I direct

your call? Hello? Hello?

GRAHAM and CLIVE continue to gawp. The shape stand and steps

into the light. GRAHAM and CLIVE go slack. Standing in front

of them, clad only in cut-off short and flip-flops... is an

ALIEN.

Put - the phone - down.

Without the slightest change of expression CLIVE rocks

backwards in a dead faint. He hits the ground with a bump.

GRAHAM looks at CLIVE then back at the ALIEN. When GRAHAM

speaks his voice quivers with hysterical panic.

What have you done to him?

21.

I didn't do anything. He fainted.

Yes but you made him faint.

I did not. Okay I did, but it's not

like i set my phaser to " Faint'.

You've got a phaser!?

No! Look, I need you to help. Can

you get this guy back onto your

wagon?

Are you going to probe us?

No! Where does that come from? Why

do people always assume we want to

stick something up their ass?

Don't you?

No. There's certainly nothing about

it in the encounter manual. As a

rule, we don't even abduct. Maybe

people find it easier to deal with

earthly transgressions if they

suppress it with absurd fantasies

about alien probing.

What?

It's just a theory. Listen, focus

okay? I promise you I won't hurt

you, I just need your help.

You need my help?

Yes.

How come I can understand you? Are

you using some sort of neural

language router?

22.

No, I'm speaking English you prick.

(off GRAHAM's expression)

Sorry, I'm tense. Look, what's your

name?

Graham Willy.

What about him?

That's the writer, Clive Gollings.

Well, let's get Clive into the RV

and get going. I'll explain

everything on the way. Please.

Where are we going?

North.

The RV's gotta be back in 2 days.

Well, then we're gonna have to

hustle, aren't we?

Look Graham, you're just gonna have

to trust me, okay?

GRAHAM looks at the ALIEN. It stands at roughly 3 feet tall.

His black almond shaped eye glint. His large head tilts to

one side, his small mouth opens slightly, his long fingers

clasp together, pleading.

Please man, I need you.

GRAHAM considers the ALIEN for a moment.

Okay then.

Great. Thank you.

What's your name?

23.

I'm Paul.

Paul?

Yeah. Now let's get Cloverfield

onto the recreational vehicle and

get the fuck off MacArthur's Black

Mile.

They attempt to move CLIVE. PAUL senses something.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Oh man, has he...?

I told him he should have gone.

Could have been worse. Know what

I'm saying?

They drag him into the RV. The door shuts, a few seconds

later, GRAHAM appears and runs round to the back of the RV.

He rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board. The RV

starts up and drives off.

INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT

GRAHAM drives, agitated. He looks behind him a couple of

times. PAUL is hunting around in the fridge.

Can I have this ham?

Uh... yes.

Great!

PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth,

wolfing it down hungrily.

Paul? Where am I going again?

I told you, North. Do you have a

map?

GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield.

Not when we're driving, Graham.

24.

The map disappears back up into the roller.

Sorry.

Just head North. We need to get as

much distance as we can between us

and them.

Them? Who's them?

EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

We hear the noise of engines, then boots on concrete as a

dozen soldiers rush the area, attending the crash. A suited

man gets out of a Sedan car. We don't see his face at first.

The shot remains at his hip. He reaches into his pocket and

pulls out a Twinkie. He unwraps it and brings it up to his

mouth. We follow and see his face for the first time.

Chiselled, focused, confident. This is SPECIAL AGENT ZOIL. A

SOLDIER approaches.

Sir?

Talk to me.

Three survivors, company men, hurt

but alive.

Anyone else?

No sir.

ZOIL looks into the sky and breathes in the night air.

What's this?

The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet.

ZOIL touches the wet patch and licks his finger.

What is it sir? Brake fluid? Gas?

No. It's neither of those things.

He looks around, then notices tire tracks in the dust by the

side of the road. ZOIL stands, full of purpose. He returns to

his car and hits a button on the dash.

25.

What's the situation?

We have a guest who's left the

hotel without paying, sir.

Damn it! Do you think he's " left'

left?

Doubtful. NORAD would have picked

up a bogie. Those guys can track

Santa. No sir, he's still here.

Question is, for how long?

Don't you think this is all a bit

of a coincidence?

How so?

I signed the red document this

morning, Zoil. Don't you think it's

odd that he chooses today to go

AWOL? How did he know?

Are you suggesting he has someone

on the inside.

Maybe.

Well he's definitely got someone on

the outside.

What?

Tire tracks, sir. Tire tracks...

among other things. I'd bet my left

nut that little bastard's hitched a

ride.

Lock down the area. Road blocks,

spot checks, the whole nine yards.

You're going to handle this

personally, Zoil. I want this

wrapped up before Letterman.

26.

EXT/INT. RV. NIGHT - A FEW HOURS LATER

Close on the wheel. Pull out to reveal the RV.

Inside, CLIVE's eyes open. From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear

the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder. He

notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry. He leans out to

see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the

bathroom door. The toilet flushes.

CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens. A pair of

skinny grey legs in cut-off shorts pass the bunk.

The bulb's gone in there.

CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his

middle. He creeps toward the front of the RV. GRAHAM drives,

PAUL sits in the Chewie seat eating pistachios.

I hate it when you get the closed

ones, right?

I usually bite them open.

Are you fucking insane? You gotta

tap " em and if they don't open you

throw them away.

That's molluscs.

Shut up.

It's true.

Hello Clive! How are you feeling?

I'm feeling like I've gone MENTAL

MAD, Graham. If that is your name?

You're happily sitting there

chatting to... to... that, like

it's the most natural thing in the

world. The two of you laughing away

like you haven't seen each other

since 1990.

PAUL spits a shell out into a cup.

27.

CLIVE (CONT'D)

So forgive me if I seem a little

rattled but from where I'm standing

it would appear you are trading nut

knowledge with an alien life form.

His name is Paul.

Oh, Paul is it? Paul what? Paul

Verhoven? Paul Freeman? Paul

Reiser?

Just Paul. You know, like Madonna

or Dracula.

Paul's from a small planet in the

northern spiral arm of the

Andromeda Galaxy.

No he is not!

I am man, seriously.

How could he possibly have

travelled that distance?

Wormhole.

Balls! Graham, this isn't what it

seems. What about Ocham's Razor?

The hairdressers?

Yes, the old man who owns it told

me that, in unbelievable

circumstances, the most plausible

explanation is usually the truth.

And what's the most plausible

explanation, Clive?

That you're a thin midget in an

alien costume.

28.

There's no such thing as a thin

midget? Those guys are built. Have

you not seen The Station Agent?

He's right. I think that's less

believable than Paul being form a

planet in the norther spiral arm of

the Andromeda Galaxy.

CLIVE (CONT'D)

Oh really?

With this CLIVE grabs at PAUL. He pulls at the alien's skin,

trying to gain a hold of a mask.

Ow! Get off me!

You're not real. You're not real!

Excuse me.

Get off me, you fucking psycho!

EXCUSE ME!

CLIVE releases PAUL and looks out of the RV to see the

flashing lights of a road block. GRAHAM slows down.

Oh shit!

CLIVE looks round to discover that PAUL has vanished. GRAHAM

pulls the RV onto the hard shoulder.

Where's he gone?

Maybe he beamed up.

As if. We would have seen the

classic shimmer and hum.

Good point.

BANG, BANG, BANG!

GRAHAM and CLIVE look to the door. Both terrified.

29.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT

GRAHAM and CLIVE stand outside the RV being questioned by an

AGENT dressed like ZOIL. We can hear noise and activity from

the RV. Another AGENT is aboard the RV.

Where you boys from? Australia?

Britain.

Ah. G'day mate.

The AGENT smiles. GRAHAM and CLIVE look terrified.

Whatcha doin' in the US fellas?

Comic-con.

You're a long way from San Diego.

We were having a little drive.

Is that right?

AGENT 2 (O.S.)

Hey Haggard?!

Yeah?

O'REILLY appears at the door waving a 10x8" photograph.

These guys have met Michael Biehn.

No shit! How was he?

He was a good egg.

Very unaffected.

That's nice to hear.

O'Reilly? Anything else?

30.

Just some pissy jeans.

HAGGARD looks down at the towel wrapped around CLIVE's waits.

CLIVE look embarrassed.

Okay, you guys can go.

Thank you. May I ask what you're

searching for?

Of course you may.

There is a slight pause. GRAHAM and CLIVE board the RV.

INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT

GRAHAM and CLIVE pull away in silence. They are both confused

and shaken.

Well, it's pretty obvious what

happened there, isn't it?

Is it?

Yes, the government used some sort

of neurotoxic paint on the Black

Mailbox, which was white by the

way, and it caused us to suffer a

shared hallucination about an

alien. I mean, it's what we've

always wanted, isn't it?

I suppose so.

Than that's what happened.

PAUL materializes from thin air behind them.

WRONG!

EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT

The sound of screeching tires draws the attention of the two

AGENTS. They see the RV swerve across the road in the

distance before righting itself and continuing on its way.

31.

INT. RV - NIGHT

Where the hell did you go?

Nowhere.

What, you went invisible?

It's not invisibility per so. It's

more like what a chameleon does

with a little light blending thrown

in for good measure.

Like Predator?

Exactly.

Can you do it whenever you want?

Anytime...

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

We hear GRAHAM squeal with delight. The RV guns up the road

into the night.

INT. RV - DAYBREAK

CLIVE drives in silence. PAUL sits in the passenger seat

eating nuts. Day is breaking over the horizon. GRAHAM snoozes

on the sofa. PAUL offers CLIVE a nut.

No thank you.

You sure? How about a cup of

coffee?

(sees he's tempted)

Come on Hulk, I'll get you a nice

cuppa J.

PAUL goes back to the galley, flicking GRAHAM on the nose as

he passes. GRAHAM wakes up with a start.

Hey, look who's up!

32.

Hello Paul.

GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him.

What's the matter?

Graham, there is a Grey in the

galley, making me coffee.

Did you want tea?

No, I don't want tea.

Tea's a bit weird in America, isn't

it?

No, what's wried, Graham, is that

we have picked up an extra

terrestrial hitch hiker and you

seem completely fine with it!

He needs our help, Clive.

PAUL returns with the coffee. GRAHAM and CLIVE curtail their

conversation. PAUL hand CLIVE his coffee.

You got it? Yes I've got it.

It's hot. (slightly testy)

Thank you.

GRAHAM looks at Paul and nods toward CLIVE. PAUL sighs and

sits in the Chewie seat. GRAHAM hangs back...

Look Clive, I'm gonna go out on a

limb and say this is probably the

weirdest thing that's ever happened

to you. Am i right?

CLIVE doesn't deny it.

And I appreciate the fact that I

have somewhat gate-crashed the

party here but, truth be told, I'm

in a hell of a pickle. I really

need your help.

33.

Why us?

Why not?

CLIVE glances back at an expectant GRAHAM.

What about the RV? It has to be

back in two days.

Clive, he's an alien. A living,

breathing, alien.

CLIVE look at PAUL who makes a sad face and does the hand

gesture from Close Encounters. CLIVE wilts.

I suppose we could phone the hire

company and get an extension.

PAUL looks super-pleased.

How did you get here?

Crashed in " 47. Anti-grav failure.

Happens to the best of us.

Also, I'm a shit driver.

Oh my God! Roswell?! That was you?!

Roswell was a smoke-screen man,

designed to distract from the

truth.

They invented a fake alien crash to

distract from an actual alien

crash?

I know, fucking stupid, isn't it?

What have you been doing here all

this time?

34.

Oh you know, kickin' back, shooting

the shit. Advising the government.

Not just the government.

INT. ROOM - DAY

A room lit by a single bulb, furnished with a table and

chair. PAUL sits with his back to us, he is smoking a

cigarette, whilst talking on the phone. We hear the voice on

the other end of the line. It is strangely familiar.

...I want him to have some kind of

special power, you know? Something

sort of messianic...

How about molecular revivification.

I don't know what that is.

Restoration of damaged tissue

through telepathic manipulation of

cellular intrinsic field memory.

I...uh...

Healing, Steven.

Oh right yeah. Like by touch sort

of thing? His little finger could

light up at the end and-

You know what? Sometimes, less is

more.

The line beeps.

You got another call?

Yeah I gotta take this man. It's

the fucking V guys again.

35.

INT. RV - DAY

Right.

You'd be surprised how much he's

influenced popular culture

generally over the last 60 years.

How come you know so much?

We had quite a long chat while you

were unconscious.

CLIVE looks miffed.

...while you were asleep.

You want a bagel Clive?

No thanks.

Graham?

Yes please.

Go on then, I'll have half.

PAUL (O.S.)

You want anything on it?

Jam.

PAUL (O.S.)

What?

Jelly.

Gotcha.

PAUL heads to the kitchen. The boys drive in silence.

I gave your jeans a swill and hung

them up.

36.

Thank you. So, do you know where

we're going?

Just North. He said we had to make

a right at Utah.

Why can't he tell us?

He said it was a surprise.

Do you trust him, Graham? I mean,

is he Strider or Black Rider?

Strider, definitely.

You'd better be right. I don't want

to wake up and find him inserting a

probe into my anus.

It's okay, he doesn't do that.

PAUL returns with three bagels on one long finger.

Bagel time!

The dashboard beeps. PAUL jumps throwing them into the air.

Fuel level's critical.

Sorry, I had a warning light just

like that on my ship.

For fuel?

Anti-grav failure.

CLIVE is looking at the sat-nav on the computer.

There's a place called Ely five

miles from here. It's small but

there should be a gas station.

Roger that, number one.

37.

CLIVE smiles at GRAHAM and flashes PAUL a triumphant look.

PAUL coughs loudly, barely disguising the word "Geeks".

INT. RV - MORNING

GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out at the gas station. It appears

deserted. PAUL has his head in the fridge, he cracks open a

V8, strolls to the front of the RV and honks the horn. An OLD

MAN peers out of the gas station window and waves.

Paul, don't do that!

Here's what I need. Some organic

beef mince, organic pork, some

veal, red onions, pine nuts,

pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a

fistful of fresh basil and 3 war

ciabattas.

You know this is a gas station?

PAUL looks disappointed.

EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

The door to the RV opens, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out onto the

forecourt, trying to look as casual as they can.

Ready?

Ready.

HOOOONNNNNKKKK! GRAHAM and CLIVE jump.

PAUL (O.S.)

Get me some more peanut M&Ms.

GRAHAM goes into the store, CLIVE to the pumps. A POLICE

CRUISER pulls onto the forecourt. CLIVE goes pale and fumbles

the nozzle back into the pump. He walks toward the checkout

as a STATE TROOPER exits his car. No matter how hard he

tries, CLIVE cannot avoid reaching the door at the same time

as the STATE TROOPER. He is tall, wide and bald.

After you.

Thanks.

38.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - MORNING

Close up on O'REILLY. He covers his face with his hands.

Coming... ready or not!

O'REILLY uncovers his eyes and comes face to face with ZOIL.

ZOIL is eating an orange, he offers a segment to O'REILLY.

Orange?

No thanks.

Nice and juicy.

I don't want to spoil breakfast.

Do you mind telling me what's going

on, Agent?

Just keeping ourselves occupied

sir. Things are pretty slow.

Where's the other one?

I don't know, let's see. Haggard?

HAGGARD steps out from behind the only man shaped cactus on

the entire desert plain. O'REILLY can't help but let out a

snort of delighted surprise. HAGGARD hurries over.

Sorry, I was just... hiding.

I see. You fellas had much traffic

through here?

Just a big RV driven by a couple of

nerds.

Nerds, huh?

Yeah, they'd been to Comic-Con and

met Michael Biehn.

39.

I've heard he's nice.

Good egg.

Very unaffected.

Did you search the vehicle

thoroughly?

Yes sir.

Find anything?

Not really. Just Michael Biehn's

autograph and some pissy jeans.

Close in on ZOIL. He seems suddenly motivated.

Did you get the license plate?

HAGGARD and O'REILLY look sheepish.

Make?

More sheepishness.

It was big.

I want everything you can remember.

Descriptions of the occupants,

height, hair, distinguishing

features. We can do it on the way.

On the way?

You're coming with me.

What about the road block sir?

It didn't work.

40.

INT. GAS STATION - MORNING

GRAHAM joins CLIVE at the check out, clutching a bag of

jerky, a bottle of chocolate milk, a burrito, a Coke, some

mini doughnuts and a massive bag of peanut M&Ms.

Don't you think that's a bit much?

Put it all back. Except the

burrito... and the doughnuts... and

the chocolate milk. Let's just pay

for it and leave.

We need bulb for the toilet.

Essential only, Graham!

They head to the counter. So does the STATE TROOPER.

Morning Chris!

Hey Dean.

Who do you think I had in my office

this morning?

Jeremy Piven?

No. The Secret Service.

GRAHAM bumps into a display of sunglasses and just stops it

tumbling. CHRIS and the STATE TROOPER glance over.

They find out how you can afford a

Dodge Viper on troopers pay?

Not yet. They're all over this

crash on the road up to Rachel.

What you think's going on?

Don't know, could be Muslims.

Jesus Cheeerist!

CLIVE and GRAHAM sidle up to the check-out.

41.

You go right ahead.

Thank you very much, officer.

Where're you guys from?

Britain.

Britain, huh? Nice place. No guns!

No guns? Jesus Cheeerist.

CHRIS take the money and the boys leave. The STATE TROOPER

and CHRIS watch them go.

EXT. GAS STATION - MORNING

The boys hurry across the forecourt past the cop car, we hear

the radio spring to life as they pass.

All units, be on the lookout for a

cream and brown Recreational

Vehicle, no plate number at this

time. Officers are advised to

contain but not board. Dean, if you

still at Gas and Go, bring back a

quart a milk and a box of doughnut

holes? Dean?

GRAHAM and CLIVE stop and stare, listening intently.

HOOOOOOONNNNNNKKKKK!

INT. RV - SOMETIME LATER

PAUL sit on the sofa catching M&Ms in his mouth. GRAHAM

drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat.

It's find for you. You'll get

whisked back to whatever lab they

kept you in and we'll be arrested

for harbouring a fugitive and sent

to Guantanamo Bay.

PAUL laughs.

Why's everything so funny? They

think we're Muslims.

42.

That's their excuse for everything.

There are worse things you can be.

We had a Muslim guy at the base.

Systems analyst called Yusef. We

used to do karaoke on Tuesday

nights. You should'a heard him do

Matthew and Son. Shame I didn't get

a chance to say salam alaikum.

Paul, the authorities know we're in

an TV.

We're hardly the only RV on the

road. Trust me, if we stay off the

highways, keep to the back routes,

we'll have a nice uneventful

journey.

BANG!!! Something strikes the windshield. Everyone jumps.

GRAHAM bring the RV to a halt. Silence.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

The door to the RV swings open, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out.

The desert road is silent. We can see for miles. On the road

lies a yellow and black bird, it is very dead.

Fuck, that made me jump.

Ah yes, the waspish markings of a

Scott's Oriole. Unmistakable.

What a waste.

Poor thing.

Nothing anyone could've done.

PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands.

What are you doing?

PAUL closes his eyes. His skin ripples with color as he sways

slightly. The bird's eyes flicker, its head lifts, it opens

its beak and tweets. GRAHAM and CLIVE are astounded by what

they are seeing.

It's a miracle!

43.

PAUL stuff the bird in his mouth with a grotesque crunch.

I'll miss these.

Why would you do that?

I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am

I?

EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

ZOIL and his men are parked on the forecourt of the gas

station. ZOIL is talking to the STATE TROOPER and CHRIS.

By the time I got the bulletin,

they were long gone. Seemed like

nice fellas to me.

Is it true they was Muslims?

They said they were British.

I think you can be both.

Jesus Cheeeeerist!

Agent Zoil?

Excuse me gentlemen.

ZOIL leaves with the two men and returns to his vehicle. The

voice of ZOIL's superior cuts the air.

Report.

We've tracked them down to a gas

station in Ely.

So why am I not witting with my

feet up, smoking a jay, watching

Erin Brockovich?

We think he may be travelling in an

RV with two British men sir.

44.

Goddamnit, I knew we should have

gone ahead with invasion in " 44.

What are they, MI6?

No, sir. Just a couple of nerds on

the lamb from Comic-Con.

Shit. My sister's kid went to that.

Little Manga faggot.

I still think this stinks, sir.

Like fat man doo-doo. It's too much

of a coincidence. He sits tight for

60 years and then suddenly now he

decides to take off. If he wanted

to go home so bad, he could've just

given us the slip when he was

playing golf with J. Edgar Hoover.

Someone must have told him. We need

to find the rat.

Leave that to me. In the meantime,

if E.T. is still M.I.A. in the P.M.

then F.Y.I. I'm tearing someone a

new A. O.K.?

Yes sir.

INT. RV - DUSK

GRAHAM is sat in the Chewie seat, PAUL is reading Jelva,

Queen Of The Varvak. CLIVE drives.

What do you think?

Ask me when I've finished it.

CLIDE rubs his yes.

You tired, Sausage?

Don't call me Sausage in front of

him.

45.

Sorry. Are you tired though?

Mummy, I am bushed.

What do you need?

Best case, I'd like a cold flannel

on my neck and an honest meal.

I hear that, Big-Rig. I can still

call you Big-Rig can't I?

Sure. Just not Sausage. Any luck

with an RV park? We need somewhere

off the beaten track, n'est pas?

Roger that. Cup of Joe?

You read my mind.

GRAHAM head to the galley, ignoring PAUL, who jumps into the

Chewie seat and stares at CLIVE.

Can I help you?

You want a cigarette?

No, thank you. I don't smoke.

PAUL lights a cigarette, the smoke wafts into CLIVE's face.

Look, I'm sorry okay? About eating

the bird.

CLIVE continues to ignore PAUL. GRAHAM arrives with the

coffee and a Honey Bun cake.

Honey Bun?

Could you unwrap it for me?

By your command.

46.

GRAHAM unwraps the cake and pops it into CLIVE's gob. PAUL

watches. GRAHAM disappears to the back of the RV.

Let me ask you something. Are you

to...?

What?

You know...

PAUL does a very weird, very long charade, demonstrating

various " group' and " one on one' homosexual practices.

No!

Okay, that's great. I just

wondered. I'm cool with it.

Everyone's " bi' where I'm from.

It's all about the pleasure thing,

you know? We've evolved beyond

paranoid notions of gender

identity. I mean, procreation is

only the functional aspect of

sexual congress right? The human

race is fairly advanced but most

males still act like a cornered

tiger if you imply the like

" smoking the bone' and let's face

it they probably do. Look at single

sex, empirical institutions,

boarding schools, prisons, pirate

ships, places where the choice has

been removed, everyone's banging

everyone else and there isn't a

whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get

out into the real world and guys

are getting smacked int he chops

for wearing pink socks. You think

you're so sophisticated because you

can distinguish yourself from your

own reflection but ultimately

you're part of a deeply neurotic

species and you'd all be a lot

better off if you stopped worrying

and learned to love the bum.

What are you trying to say?

Maybe you should start smoking.

47.

INT. RV - EVENING

Later, the RV pulls up to gate at the front of an RV park.

GRAHAM is now in the Chewie seat, PAUL stands behind,

steadying himself on the backs of their chairs.

Great find, Graham.

I sourced a website listing off the

beaten track, North American RV

parks.

I really lucked out with you nerds,

didn't I?

GRAHAM and CLIVE look proud. CLIVE drives the RV over a speed

hump into the park. PAUL loses his balance and falls over.

GRAHAM and CLIVE laugh. They pull up to a gate.

It's awfully quiet.

Just the way we like it.

PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on

the horn.

HOOOOOOONNNNK!

Stop doing that!

Someone's coming.

PAUL shimmers and disappears. GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp.

Hello?

(quietly to Graham)

We're just a couple of regular guys

on a tour of the less touristy side

of the American midwest.

I don't think she heard you.

I was talking to you.

Oh, sorry.

48.

Hello?

GRAHAM opens the door. RUTH BEHE, a young woman in her mid-

twenties stands outside. She is pretty but has no idea. She

wears glasses, one eye of which is blacked out. GRAHAM stares

at her. We hear the slide guitar moment from Olivia Newton

John's "Hopelessly Devoted To You".

Good evening, I'm Ruth Behe.

Hello Ruth. Do you mind if we come

in?

Sure. Park in Bay 9. The charge is

$50 for the night, plus $10 for

hook ups an I'll need to hang onto

an ID too.

CLIVE disappears, leaving GRAHAM and RUTH alone.

We're just a couple of regular guys

on tour of the less touristy side

of the American midwest.

Where you heading next?

Uh, east... apparently.

CLIVE returns with his passport. RUTH looks at it.

England?

Yes. London.

I love London.

Have you been?

No. Did you know it was founded by

the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium?

Yes.

Oh. I'd love to go someday.

49.

You should.

There's lots a places I wanna go.

Europe. Asia. The Antipodes. The

world's a big place. I need one of

these though.

You don't have a passport?

RUTH shakes her head forlornly. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare.

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

RUTH! RUTH! Get in here! I'm hungry

That's my father. I'll come over

and take your money in the morning.

Have a pleasant night now, won't

you?

RUTH opens the gate to allow CLIVE to drive through. GRAHAM

watches RUTH intently as they pass.

Doors to manual and cross check.

Graham? Graham?

Hmmm?

PAUL re-materializes next to GRAHAM and CLIVE.

BOO!

EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT

RUTH is walking back to a static mobile home. From the RV we

hear GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp. RUTH furrows her brow, turns

back, and goes inside.

INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

RUTH enters a static mobile home and heads for kitchenette.

From the ad-joining room we hear the sound of someone using a

police radio scanner. Garbled reports fade in and out. We

perhaps even hear ZOIL's voice briefly amid the static.

MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

What took you so long?

I was just talking.

50.

RUTH stirs a pot on the stove. She surreptitiously retrieves

an atlas from a drawer an starts to read.

MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

You talk to much.

Sorry Papa.

MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

How long they staying?

Just the night I think

MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

Hook ups?

Uh-huh.

MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

Where they headed?

East.

MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

Them California plates I saw?

Yes, but they're from London.

MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

London, Ohio?

No, London, England.

MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

Where?!

England, Papa. It's in North

Western Europe.

The atlas is snatched out of RUTH's hands. Behind her stands

the towering figure of MOSES BEHE. Almost as wide as he is

tall, his eyes glitter with fury and menace.

Europe? I'll give you Europe,

missy. Now, get and make my supper.

MOSES lumbers off with the atlas. RUTH looks dejected.

51.

EXT. RV PARK - LATER

QUICK CUTS as GRAHAM and CLIVE hook up power and water to the

RV and prepare a small BBQ.

INT. RV - MOMENTS LATER

The door to the RV opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE jump in. PAUL

lowers his book and is blinded by their headlamps.

Arrghh, what the fuck?!

Hungry?

I ate already.

GRAHAM and CLIVE look suddenly sad.

Too soon?

They nod.

Hey, I'm sorry. I'd love to break

bread with you guys. What are we

having?

GRAHAM waves a foot long hot dog around.

Willies!

PAUL gives CLIVE a " see what I mean?' look.

I'll flame up the BBQ pit. Fire's

my forte.

CLIVE sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking

mysterious. He then turns and jumps down all three steps and

slams the door of the RV behind him.

EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT

CLIVE is squirting lighter fluid over a fire. He flicks his

tongue out, summoning the flames higher. PAUL materializes

nearby, making CLIVE jump. He composes himself.

52.

Hello Clive. From the squirting of

the gas and the flicking of the

tongue, am I do assume you're a

Hendrix fan?

I am actually, yes.

I met him once.

Really?

Yeah. Nice man, really soft, He

thought I was a hallucination.

Shame what happened to him.

All the good ones die.

Meanwhile Bryan Adams releases

album seventeen.

PAUL and CLIVE share a laugh.

So you've been here for 60 years?

I know, right? Time flies when

you're confined to a U.S. military

installation.

Why did you come to earth?

I'm the vanguard of a highly

aggressive invading force.

What?!

I'm fucking with you, man. I was on

a science mission actually.

Meteorological reconnaissance. We

were surveying atmospheric

conditions on CO2 spiking, M-Class

planets. My specialist subject is

tornadoes right? So I'm buzzing

around the mid-west, looking for

twisters and all of a sudden my

A.G.G. goes offline and I crash in

the middle of some field.

53.

Next thing I know, this little girl

is pulling me out of the wreck and

then a bunch of army guys come

along and cart me off to Area 52.

51.

No, it's 52. Area 51 is just full

of old Pan Am jets and mini disc

players and shit. It's another

"clever subterfuge."

GRAHAM joins them with the food.

Just telling him about Area 52.

Ha ha yeah.

So, with my cover blown and the

natives cautious but friendly, I

figured we might as well indulge in

a little file sharing.

Mulder was right!

Mulder was my idea.

They chuckle. CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas.

Would you like a go?

PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the

Hendrix face. They laugh loudly.

EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

RUTH watches through her window. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL are

on the other side of the RV. Nevertheless, RUTH can see three

pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle, silhouetted

against the campfire. She frowns.

MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

RUTH!

RUTH backs away into the shadows.

54.

INT. RV - MORNING

It is very early in the morning. PAUL is asleep on the sofa.

There is a knock at the door. PAUL vanishes. GRAHAM and CLIVE

emerge from the bedroom in dressing gowns.

Who is it?

RUTH (O.S.)

It's Ruth.

GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other nervously. CLIVE opens

the door, as GRAHAM straightens his hair.

Good morning.

Good morning.

May I come in?

Yes.

CLIVE give GRAHAM a " what the hell are you thinking?' Look as

RUTH comes aboard. RUTH surveys the interior of the RV.

Was everything to your liking?

Yes, thank you.

Where's the other one?

The other one?

It's okay, we don't charge by the

person. That was three pairs of

legs I saw last night cavorting

round the camp fire, right?

Oh the other one. Um...

I'm in the can. I ate a closed

mollusc.

PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point. GRAHAM and

CLIVE look embarrassed. GRAHAM changes the subject.

55.

I like your shirt.

The shirt has a picture of Jesus shooting Charles Darwin in

the head. Underneath it reads, "Evolve this!"

Thanks. I got it at my church.

Why would Jesus want to shoot

Charles Darwin?

Because of his theories. Are you

men of God?

Would you like a coffee?

I suppose we're men of science.

RUTH narrow her eye.

If we believe in anything it would

be macro evolution. Cause and

effect. The establishment of a

biological order from the maelstrom

of physical and chemical chaos.

RUTH looks scandalized.

Or it could be God. You just don't

know do you?

God created the earth in six days

and on the seventh he rested.

PAUL emits another huge raspberry from the toilet.

Did you know that the universe has

been dated as being 13.5 billion

years old an that the release of

neutral hydrogen at the moment of

the big bang has enabled scientists

to do this with categorical

accuracy?

Yes.

56.

Not you!

The world is 4000 years old.

PAUL (O.S.)

Oh come on!

PAUL (O.S.)

Horseshit!

RUTH approaches the toilet door, taking up her fight with the

unseen third passenger. She bangs on the door. GRAHAM and

CLIVE are bewildered by this sudden turn of events.

Explain to me how something as

complicated as the human eye simply

comes into being.

PAUL (O.S.)

Oh, don't give me that old

irreducible complexity crap-

They eye is comprised of three

interacting parts. Remove any one

of them and it ceases to exist. It

has the precision and delicacy of a

pocket watch and, when the good

Lord permits, it works in perfect

harmony with its environment.

Something as functionally perfect

as that doesn't just occur without

the intervention of a guiding hand.

PAUL (O.S.)

But it didn't just occur did it? It

is the culmination of millions of

years of development across

countless species.

What are you talking about?

PAUL (O.S.)

Evolution baby.

RUTH screams and bangs the door.

It'd design!

57.

PAUL (O.S.)

If He designed it, why didn't He

just make it one part and take the

whole weekend off?

Nothing you can so or do can shake

my belief, or faith in the sure and

certain knowledge that God made

Heaven and earth and created us all

in His own image.

Oh yeah?

(stepping out of the toilet)

Well then how do you explain me?

RUTH's mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream, her eye rolls

up, her hair turns white. She collapses.

And that's Jenga.

What did you do that for?

I didn't do anything, she fainted.

She saw you!

Oh come on. Who's gonna believe

anything she says?

The authorities will be on the look

out for exactly this sort of thing.

What, a delusional, one-eyed God

botherer?

Paul, right now they're going to

follow any lead they can get.

I didn't think of that.

We could take her with us.

What?

58.

We're only going to be a couple of

days. We could let her go once

Paul's gone home. I'm sure she'll

be fine once she gets to know us.

PAUL and CLIVE consider this.

How am I going to get my passport

back?

PAUL vanishes.

PAUL (O.S.)

Leave it to me.

INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY

The door opens, seemingly by itself. PAUL materializes in the

kitchenette and starts looking around for CLIVE's passport.

He roots around noisily in drawers and cupboards, until he

spies his quarry on the work-top. He checks the passport and

finds CLIVE's absurd picture. He laughs.

Hallelujah.

MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

Ruth, what in the Lord's name-

MOSES and PAUL come face to face. They regard each other for

a second.

Boo?

EXT. RV PARK - DAY

PAUL burst out of the BEHE RESIDENCE, pursued by MOSES who is

loading a shotgun.

GO! GO! GO!

The RV start to move forward. The door swings open and GRAHAM

appears, beckoning to PAUL. PAUL reaches the door, just as

MOSES levels the gun at his target. PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's

arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a

booming shot. The BEHE mailbox explodes into pieces, as the

RV careens off out of the trailer park.

INT. RV - DAY

Blackness. RUTH wakes up. Panic in her eyes. CLIVE drives,

GRAHAM sits on the sofa, biting his nails.

59.

Hi.

Where am I?

PAUL leans round from the Chewie seat and smile.

Hey, look who's up.

DEMON!

Would you like a cup of tea?

RUTH starts to pray furiously.

I'm so sorry it had to be this way

Ruth. We're definitely not going to

hurt you and we'll let you go as

son as we can. We were just a

little concerned that you might

call the police.

You have been deceived. Deceived by

an agent of Satan himself.

PAUL (O.S.)

You know I'm sitting right here?

He's not a demon Ruth, he's from

another world and we're helping him

get home. He's not evil. He's just

very rude.

How can he be from another world?

There is only one world. Our world,

created by God the Father.

PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM. RUTH whimpers.

Look, if it makes you feel any

better, my existence only disproves

the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo-

Christian God, as well as all

single earth theologies. Science

still hasn't categorically rule out

the notion of divinity, even though

evolutionary biology suggest the

non-existence of a creator by

probability alone.

60.

How could that possibly make me

feel any better?

Jesus Christ, I was just trying to

be nice!

I think what Paul's trying to say

is, just because there are other

inhabited planets, it's not the end

of the world.

This isn't happening! You're a

hallucination. You're not real.

You're a test. A test from God.

You can't win can you?

RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an

awful noise.

I can't drive like this. We'll have

to drop her off and take our

chances.

No!

Oh, for God's sake.

PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her

forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up

into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The

cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's

ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAUL

telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind. They

collapse in a heap on the floor. PAUL sparks up a cigarette.

What did you do to her?!

I broadened her horizons.

Can you broaden mine?

No, it's tiring.

GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying.

61.

Oh please.

Come here then.

PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all

fluttery. We don't see the images this time. GRAHAM falls.

Oh great! Everyone knows the

secrets of the universe apart from

me. He always knew what was going

on in Buffy before me because his

mum had cable.

Can't I just tell you?

No spoilers!

PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps

CLIVE who falls to the floor. Everyone lays inert.

Maybe I should make that tea?

EXT. RV PARK - DAY

THREE BLACK SEDANS are parked in the BEHE RV park.

MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

I didn't call the government. I

called the po-lice.

INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY

Given your description of the

intruder, the police felt your call

was perhaps better directed to us.

And who are you?

Secret Service, sir.

I knew it. You know that devil took

my Ruth.

And Ruth's your daughter?

62.

That's right. Her Mama died when

she was born. I good as brought her

up by myself. Wasn't easy either.

Two mouths to feed and this place

to run.

I understand. Do you have a

photography of Ruth, Mr. Behe?

MOSES retrieves an old cigar box and produces a tattered

photograph of Ruth. She appears younger, with both eyes

intact and with dark hair.

She's pretty.

MOSES snorts.

Do you have a phone Mr. Behe? In

case she tries to contact you.

I do...

ZOIL nods at HAGGARD who immediately starts dialling on his

satellite phone, moving into a different room.

...and she'll call me if she can.

Ruth's never really been outta

Carbon County.

You say they went East?

Uh-huh. They'll have to get off the

191 after Flaming Gorge if they

ain't using the interstate, there's

been a rig spill just South of

Dutch John.

So?

So that means they'll be on the 44.

Only way to go.

ZOIL looks at O'REILLY.

Let's go. Haggard!

63.

Tell me you're gonna kill that

thing, Mr. Zoil. Kill it for what

it is.

We'll do our best, Mr. Behe.

Watch yourself now. I seen its

eyes. It's evil.

ZOIL, HAGGARD and O'REILLY leave. MOSES watches them.

God's speed, Mr. Zoil.

EXT. RV PARK - DAY

ZOIL's radio crackles to life.

HAGGARD (O.S.)

Man, that way was one fat freak!

O'REILLY (O.S.)

If I was that girl, I think I'd

rather take my chances with the

alien.

HAGGARD and O'REILLY hoot with laughter.

Can it, you two! How many times do

I have to tell you?

INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY

MOSES is sat at his kitchen table listening to his police

scanner. HAGGARD and O'REILLY's laughter rattles loudly over

the radio.

ZOIL (O.S.)

We do not refer to the target as

" The Alien'.

MOSES's expression is mixture of fury and disbelief. He

glances at something nearby. Pull focus to the shotgun, lying

in the foreground on the kitchen table.

We hear an engine splutter into life, revving furiously.

EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY

MOSES in his pick up truck, screams off in pursuit.

64.

INT. RV - DAY

CLOSE on PAUL. He is staring at something in wonder.

Wow.

Pull out to reveal him sitting next to GRAHAM and CLIVE,

looking out through the RV's windshield.

We see their POV. A breathtaking panorama of natural beauty.

They are parked up at the summit of a mountain road, looking

out across the vista.

There it is, boys. Wyoming.

Is that where we're going?

Maybe. I gotta tell ya. It's at

times like these you winder if the

intelligent design crowd aren't

onto something. I mean look at it.

Hey Ruth, get up here.

They look round, the door of the RV is open, RUTH is gone.

Ruth!?

Someone should go after her.

Graham?

CLIVE looks round to see GRAHAM gone.

Graham!?

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

RUTH is storming up the road.

Ruth!

Leave me alone!

Ruth, please stop, I've got shin

splints.

RUTH stops. GRAHAM catches up to her.

65.

Are you alright?

He can't be from space. It's not

possible.

Ruth, you saw for yourself. It's

not just possible, it's probably.

There's probably millions of

intelligent civilizations.

So, where is everybody?

Well, one of them is right there.

RUTH and GRAHAM look back at the RV. PAUL is stood on the

dashboard with his bare buttocks pressed against the window.

CLIVE is trying not to laugh.

Everything I've ever been told is a

lie. My purpose. My truth. All

false. DO you know how that feels?

To suddenly have nothing?

Just because your truth wasn't the

truth, it doesn't mean there is no

truth, Ruth.

Huh?

I understand you're probably

feeling very confused right now.

Religious belief systems are

devised to give us context and

security. To stop us feeling lonely

and unimportant.

I do feel lonely and unimportant!

How can this all be an accident? It

doesn't make sense. Did you know

the reason we have solar eclipses

is because the sun is exactly 400

times bigger than the moon and the

moon is exactly 400 times closer to

the earth?

GRAHAM considers saying " yes' but decides against it.

How can that be an accident.

66.

It isn't, it's a coincidence. Or it

probably is. That's the beauty of

the universe.

But what's the point? If there's

nothing afterwards, what's the

point in living?

This is the point, Ruth. Right now.

This conversation. That tree, your

next cheeseburger. Life is a

miracle. People spend so much time

focusing on rescuing the princess,

they forget how much fun it is to

fight the dragon.

Huh?

Carl Sagan said " A religion, old or

new, that stressed the magnificence

of the universe as revealed by

modern science might be able to

draw forth reserves of reverence

and awe hardly tapped by the

conventional faiths.'

Huh?

It's okay not to know, Ruth. It's

wonderful because it means we still

have things to learn. We still have

life to live.

I'm frightened.

So am I, but it passes, sort of.

Ruth, we're on an amazing adventure

and I think you should come with

us. I know you feel confused and

lost but if you get back on board

that RV, you might just find the

very thing you're looking for.

I... I'm not sure.

67.

I'm sure Ruth. I'm sure because I

can honestly say, I have never

talked to a woman for this long

without blushing.

That's so sweet.

GRAHAM blushes, deep, dark, red.

INT. RV - DAY

GRAHAM and RUTH get back onto the RV. GRAHAM looks pleased

with himself.

She's going to be fine. I think

your hair looks good by the way.

You look like Storm.

Who's Storm?

From X-Men.

Exactly.

RUTH goes to the bathroom.

RUTH (O.S.)

AAARRRRGGGHHHHH! MY FREAKIN' HAIR!

EXT/INT. RV - DAY

The RV drives across the rugged countryside. GRAHAM, CLIVE,

RUTH and PAUL appear in various combinations.

GRAHAM drives with PAUL in the Chewie seat, CLIVE sleeps on

the sofa, RUTH can be seen sitting on the bed at the back.

CLIVE drives with GRAHAM in the Chewie seat. PAUL just

behind, RUTH on the sofa. She is staring at PAUL. PAUL turns

round, she looks away.

PAUL drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat, GRAHAM and RUTH

just behind. The RV weaves from side to side.

Small corrections! Small

corrections!

RUTH drives. Everyone else is asleep.

68.

EXT/INT. ZOIL'S CAR/HAGGARD'S CAR/O'REILLY'S CAR - DAY

We see ZOIL's convoy. ZOIL drives, his eyes intent on the

road, searching. He reaches down out of shot, then brings a

taco to hi mouth and takes a bit. A truck passes. We see

HAGGARD in his car, talking animatedly on his cell phone. The

truck passes. We see O'REILLY in his car, he is asleep at the

wheel. The truck passes, horn blaring. O'REILLY wakes up

suddenly, looking rattled.

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

The RV is parked up. It is a little speck on an enormous

landscape. Next to the highway is a sign which reads " YOU ARE

NOW LEAVING UTAH.' Underneath this a separate sign reads

" LEAVING PACIFIC TIME ZONE ENTERING MOUNTAIN TIME ZONE.' PAUL

leaps back and forth over the line.

11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock,

12 o'clock, 11 o'clock. Come on!

It's fun.

We see CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH standing in the middle of the

road watching PAUL.

This is the furthest I've ever

been.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

ZOIL's convoy pulls into an Arby's. The three AGENTS leap out

of their cars and run in. After a short pause MOSES BEHE's

pick up truck passes through shout; " Onward Christian

Soldiers' blares from the radio.

INT. RV - NIGHT

GRAHAM drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat. PAUL hangs

back. RUTH emerges from the bedroom. She has swapped her

Darwin T-shirt for one of GRAHAM's. It's an X-files T-shirt

emblazoned with a UFO and the legend, I WANT TO BELIEVE.

You don't mind, do you, Graham?

It looks nice.

Hey, we should stop for something

to eat. Are you hungry, Ruth?

69.

What?

I'm hungry.

What's new, fatty?

Hey, it's not fat, it's power. I

happen to be very strong.

PAUL summons a phlegm ball with a grotesque snort and spits

it onto the floor of the RV.

Pick that up then.

So childish.

Maybe I should call Papa.

PAUL/GRAHAM/CLIVE

What?!

Look, I've been missing for a whole

day. If he's called the police,

they'll be looking for us and if

they find us, this " amazing

adventure' is going to come to an

end real quick. I just need to tell

him I'm fine and that I'll be back

soon, okay?

PAUL offers up a high five to RUTH.

Right up top!

RUTH yelps, terrified that PAUL is going to zap her again.

Too soon?

CLIVE reaches down and picks up PAUL's phlegm ball.

I did it!

EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

GRAHAM, CLIVE and RUTH step out of the RV.

70.

Okay, in and out, yes? Don't talk

to anyone unless you have to and

try to look inconspicuous.

Angle on the most conspicuous threesome in America.

HOOOOOOOONNNK.

I wish he'd stop doing that!

They enter the bar. Parked nearby, is a black Lincoln

Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

The bar is very busy. Scantily clad waitresses serve a

variety of customers. People play pool, other people dance to

a small band. RUTH spies a pay phone at the back.

I won't be long.

We'll order food and wait for you

at the bar.

Okay.

Be careful.

RUTH walks through to the back, past the toilets. As she

passes, MOSES BEHE steps out of the Men's, they miss each

other by moments. He walks up to the bar, next to GRAHAM and

CLIVE who are looking at a menu. MOSES orders.

Tap water.

INT. BAR. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER

RUTH dials. She listens nervously. Click.

OPERATOR (O.S.)

Ruth Behe?

Yes?

OPERATOR (O.S.)

Please hold, your call is being

diverted.

71.

Wait, I...

ZOIL (O.S.)

Ruth Behe?

Yes?

ZOIL (O.S.)

Agent Zoil, Secret Service. Listen

very carefully. You're in great

danger.

How did you...?

ZOIL (O.S.)

We know who you're travelling with

Ruth. I need you and your friend to

turn yourselves in.

What if we don't want to turn

ourselves in?

INT. HIGHWAY. ROADSIDE - NIGHT

ZOIL talks on a satellite phone. HAGGARD works on a laptop

nearby. O'REILLY listens in.

Where are you? Where are you

headed?

RUTH (O.S.)

I don't know.

Look, I know you think you're doing

the right thing but I promise you,

I'm only thinking about you. And

Paul. You care about Paul, don't

you?

RUTH (O.S.)

I don't know how I feel about him.

He's weird and also, rude.

Yes he is.

RUTH (O.S.)

I asked him why he wore shorts and

he said if he didn't I'd see his

big spaceman balls.

72.

INT. BAR. PAY PHONE - NIGHT

Loud giggles, followed by angry shushing from ZOIL.

Who's there with you?

ZOIL (O.S.)

Ruth, please listen to me. Your

father is worried about you. We

want to get you home. I need you to

tell me where you are.

He showed me things.

You're not still talking about his

balls, are you?

I... i just want to know what's

real. I'm confused. I... I...

RUTH struggles. Her expression shows great conflict.

HAGGARD (O.S.)

WE GOT HER!

ZOIL (O.S.)

Damnit, Haggard!

RUTH panics and slams down the phone. She realizes what she

may have done and rushes back toward the bar, slamming into

two men. The MEATHEADS, drunk, look down at her, amused.

Hey, slow down there cyclops.

I need to get to my friends.

Why the hurry? You know I got a

friend with one eye who'd love to

meet you.

I happen to have two eyes actually.

I just have a severe stigmatism.

You should get that fixed up.

Reckon you'd be kinda pretty in the

right light.

Yeah, the dark.

73.

Papa said the Lord would fix it.

The Lord ain't gonna fix nothing

sweetheart.

No shit.

RUTH plants her knee firmly into the groin of GUS. He doubles

up knocking his friend over. RUTH bolts.

INT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER

GRAHAM and CLIVE are clutching brown paper bags full of food,

RUTH returns from the Phone.

How's your dad?

We need to leave now.

We're still waiting on a wet fries.

The two MEATHEADS emerge from the pay phone. Angry.

Holy shit! It's the space faggots

that dinged the fuck-mobile!

Look, I'm terribly sorry. Perhaps

we can exchange insurance details?

I'm sorry I don't speak " nerd'.

GRAHAM and CLIVE look terribly offended.

These the " friends' you told us

about, baby?

Yes, they are.

Well whaddya know? Small world.

We were just leaving.

I don't think so.

74.

JAKE grabs RUTH. GRAHAM pushes him hard in the chest.

Leave her alone!

What did you say?

(timid but resolute)

He said, leave her alone.

At this, JAKE pulls his fist back to hit CLIVE, knocking a

tray of drinks all over a table full of men. They immediately

spring up and lunge after the MEATHEADS who turn their

attention to the attack. The fight spreads like fire. GRAHAM

grabs RUTH's hand and follows CLIVE as he scrambles through

the fracas. As they reach the door RUTH is yanked back and

comes face to face with her father.

RUTH?!

PAPA?!

Graham?

I'm taking you home.

I... I can't.

Don't talk back to me, girl!

A chair smashes across MOSES's head, knocking him out. Behind

him, bloodied and angry are the two MEATHEADS.

EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH explode out of the bar and run toward

the RV. The MEATHEADS crash out after them.

What about Papa?!

Hey, we ain't finished with you.

75.

Graham, take Ruth into the RV and

lock the door. I don't want either

of you to see this.

CLIVE turns back to the MEATHEADS. BANG! CLIVE is struck in

the face, he falls, nose bleeding.

They turn to RUTH and GRAHAM, who back up against the RV. The

MEATHEADS approach ominously. The RV door bursts open. PAUL

stands silhouetted against the interior lights.

Yo fucknuts!

The MEATHEADS freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears a few

feet from them, their eyes bulge.

So, who wants to get probed first?

The MEATHEADS swoon and simultaneously hit the deck.

Ha! Only one of us fainted!

Tell me you got the food?

CLIVE gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food.

Sirens wail in distance. RUTH turns white.

It's them.

Who?

It wasn't my fault. They answered

the phone. He knew all about us.

Who? Who are you talking about?

Get in the RV!

SMASH CUT. The RV roars to life, backing up at speed into the

MEATHEAD's vehicle. MOSES BEHE bursts out of the bar, just as

the RV passes. RUTH sees him out of the window. MOSES locks

eye with his daughter. He runs to his pick up but realises he

doesn't have his keys. The RV tears off into the night,

leaving MOSES BEHE bellowing with anger and the Lincoln

Escalade, shiny, mean, fucked.

76.

INT. RV - NIGHT

The RV pulls off the road into a secluded lay-by. The gang

sit in silence for a while.

Was that your dad, Ruth?

RUTH nods.

He was so angry.

He's always angry.

GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL all exchange looks.

Are you alright, Ruth?

RUTH nods, still distant.

I'm feeling pretty amped up. Anyone

wanna take a walk?

I'm game.

You want to come for a walk, Ruth?

Thanks, but I think I'm going to

turn in. It's been a long day what

with meeting you guys, being

abducted by and alien and having my

whole belief system called into

question.

Sorry about that.

It was amazing though, wasn't it?

Remember when Paul said " Yo

fucknuts'? That was brilliant.

You gotta talk the talk, right?

What about when I got smacked in

the nose?

77.

Yeah yeah Snorlax, you're a real

hero. Come on. Let's skedaddle. You

want anything Ruth?

No, you go, I'll be fine. Here

Clive.

RUTH hands CLIVE her handkerchief. It is embroidered with the

words " JESUS SAVES'.

Thank you.

He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers.

You can sleep in my bunk if you'd

like.

She smiles at him. He goes to leave but turns back.

I'd use a pen to push the tissues

off the bed. I've had a cold.

EXT. DESERTED TOWN - NIGHT

GRAHAM and PAUL stand outside a liquor store on the main drag

of a quiet town. Next door is a Western themed clothing

store. PAUL looks in the window.

Hey Graham. Check this out. What

d'ya think?

PAUL indicates to a small cowboy outfit, big enough for a

child, displayed in the window.

I'd look pretty hot, right?

Space cowboy.

Steve Miller Band. I love that

song. Speaking of midnight tokers,

I got a littler herbal refreshment

in my pants. Do you guys partake?

No.

Shame. I get it from the military.

This is the shit that killed Dylan.

78.

Bob Dylan's still alive.

Is he?

CLIVE comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer.

Let's party!

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL have made a camp fire in a woodland

clearing on the other side of town. They sit round drinking

beers and chatting. PAUL rolls a joint.

So why " Paul'? It's not very, you

know, alien.

Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or

something?

No.

P-o-o-u-r-l?

No, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or

the little guy from Simon and

Garfunkel.

Paul Simon.

Paul Simon. Paul's not my real

name. It's a name I got given.

What's your real name?

You won't be able to pronounce it.

I can speak Klingon.

What a geek.

Hey!

79.

Come on, what's your real name.

PAUL opens his mouth and screeches.

Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa.

Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa.

That's pretty good.

Rootchaa? That sounds like Roger.

Fuck you!

Calm down, Rog.

More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint.

You look like a poster on a

student's wall.

That was my gag! " Take me to your

dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine.

Never saw a dime.

You never answered my question. Why

Paul? Who called you Paul?

The little girl who found me when I

crashed. It was terrible actually.

I killed her dog. I didn't mean to!

My ship sort of landed on it. When

the military arrived I was

delirious; I kept saying "Paul?

Paul?" It was the only English I

knew, because I'd heard the little

girl saying it over and over.

Spooks thought it was my name.

She called her dog Paul?

Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles.

What happened to the little girl?

80.

Who knows? Never saw her again.

Think about her everyday though.

PAUL offers the joint round. CLIVE and GRAHAM decline. PAUL

takes a deep drag. During the following exchange, GRAHAM,

CLIVE and PAUL start to move simultaneously as though

governed by some kind of psychic link.

It's strange, isn't it? Ordinarily

in this situation Graham and I

would be looking up at the stars,

wondering about life on other

planets but we know now, don't we?

It's a bit of an anti-climax.

Thanks a bunch, Hurley.

I don't mean that in a bad way.

They all scratch their noses.

Paul, can I ask you something?

Shoot.

Why are you in such a hurry to

leave?

I've outlived my usefulness.

How so?

There's only so much knowledge I

can share about the universe and

quantum theory and how to make a

really nice meatball sandwich. The

only thing I have to offer them now

are my abilities.

So?

So the only way they're going to

get hold of them is by obtaining

some of somatic stem cells.

81.

So what, do they take a swab from

your cheek?

Negative.

Stool?

Sadly, not that simple.

Blood?! Oh my god, I hate needles.

Believe me, a needle would be a

picnic compared to what they had in

store for me.

I don't follow.

Stem cells are multipotent.

GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank.

Lineage defined?

GRAHAM and CLIVE still look blank.

PAUL (CONT'D)

The camouflage response, the memory

transfer, the revivification, they

all originate in my cerebellum. In

order to cultivate them in a

laboratory they would have to...

Cut your brain out.

Bingo! Fortunately, someone was

kind enough to give me the heads

up, if you'll pardon the pun. So,

when they were transferring me to

the medical facility and I noticed

the bumper sticker on your RV, I

figured you might be sympathetic

types. I zapped the spooks, grabbed

the wheel and took my chance.

I thought the crash was our fault.

82.

Well it was, kinda.

So, you're saying if they catch

you...

PAUL draws his thumb across his neck. GRAHAM and CLIVE look

at PAUL in horror. All three scratch their heads.

So tell me, are you guys virgins or

what?

No.

They all cough.

Alright then, Clive, when was the

last time you got laid.

Comic-Con 2005. Ewok chick.

Three years ago you had sex with a

midget?

She was an Ewok!

Sniff.

There are only two types of person

small enough to fit inside an Ewok

costume.

She was a midget.

I can't believe you thought boning

a space bear sounded less

embarrassing than a person of short

stature.

I know. I'm sorry.

Was it nice?

83.

You sly dog!

PAUL rolls onto his back, clapping. GRAHAM snorts into his

beer, laughing. CLIVE joins in. Before long, the three

friends are rolling around in hysterics, utterly out of

control. After about thirty seconds of this, they pass out.

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

The sun has just risen. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL lie round the

smoldering camp fire sleeping soundly. PAUL is very white.

His eyes open. He looks around.

Oh shit! Hey, wake up. Wake up. We

fell asleep.

How did that happen?

Sorry, I get this thing when I get

high. It's called " projective

empathy'. You feel what I feel.

Like in E.T.?

Exactly.

Oh, thank God. For a second there I

thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer.

The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood.

Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet

town of last night has become very busy indeed.

Oh dear!

I can't walk through there.

How are we going to get back?

Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life.

EXT. TOWN - DAY

GRAHAM and CLIVE walk down the busy main street, between them

is PAUL. He is dressed in the little cowboy suit from the

shop window, his hat pulled down low over his face.

84.

Maybe we should hold hands, so that

we look like a family.

That's great! Two grown men who

look like sex offenders holding

hands with a child cowboy.

You could be a midget.

You're obsessed with midgets!

They continue on, trying to look as if nothing is strange.

Seem to be working, Clive. Clive?

GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them. He looks

back to see CLIVE, gawping thought the window of a COMIC

SHOP, at a sword resembling the one they saw at Comic-Con.

The tag reads " Genuine " BLADE' Katana'. $299.99.

Clive, no.

CLIVE walks into the shop. GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly

behind. As they enter the COMIC SHOP, MOSES BEHE emerges from

the adjacent Drug Store. He takes a couple of pain killers

and flexes his sore shoulders. He wanders up the road,

scanning the passers by.

INT. COMIC SHOP - DAY

GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who is at the counter.

Now's not really the time, Sausage.

I must have it.

It's very cheap. Are you sure you

don't want to save up and get a

proper on?

Oh, come on, we've got time.

INT/EXT. RV - DAY

Close on RUTH's watch. She paces, worried.

KNOCK KNOCK.

85.

Where have you been? I was worried.

She opens the door. AGENT ZOIL flashes his badge.

Good morning, Ma'am. Sorry to

trouble you. Agent Zoil, Secret

Service. Your wagon here matches

the description of a recreational

vehicle we're currently looking

for. May I ask, are you alone?

RUTH pauses a second.

Yes, I'm alone.

Do you mind taking a look at these

pictures?

ZOIL pulls out three pictures and hands them to RUTH. CCTV

shots of GRAHAM and CLIVE at the gas station and MOSES's pic

of RUTH, looking younger, with dark hair and no glasses.

Do you recognise any of these

people, Miss?

She lingers on the picture of herself.

Miss?

No, sorry I don't.

Where are you coming from, Ma'am?

Christian ministry in Seattle. I've

been driving for 5 days.

Going far?

Austin.

Great town.

Oh yes. It has an impressive bat

population you know?

86.

Folks gather by the rive in the

evening to watch them fly out. Turn

the sky black. Quite a sight.

Is that so?

Uh-huh. Well, I really should be

getting along.

Of course. Thanks for your time,

Miss...?

Beat.

Darwin, Charlotte Darwin.

ZOIL smiles and nods. He laves.

INT. COMIC SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

GRAHAM and CLIVE are at the counter. CLIVE is trying out the

blade. PAUL, in cowboy guise browses the racks of comics. He

picks one up. The cover features an alien that looks a lot

like him. The comic is called " Encounter Briefs: Tales From

the Dreamland'. PAUL smiles and shakes his head. He suddenly

realises he is being watched. Next to him is a child, (8)

small enough to see under PAUL's hat. He is looking at the

cover of the comic and back at PAUL.

How's it going?

Is that you?

No.

It looks like you.

Suppose it does. What's your name?

Keith Nash.

I'm Paul. Pleased to meet you.

They shake hands.

You on your own here, Keith Nash?

87.

My Mom's shopping for some new

jeans. She lets me wait in here.

Sounds like a good Mum.

Yes and no. What're you doing here?

My friend's buying a sword. He's a

grown man.

What a nerd.

PAUL laughs. So does KEITH NASH.

You an M&Ms man, Keith?

PAUL produces his M&Ms. He offers one to KEITH.

I am but I shouldn't.

Strangers with candy, right?

Right.

Well, we've got a lot in common. We

both like comics and M&Ms. Guess

that makes us pals.

Guess so.

KEITH beams at PAUL and takes a few M&Ms. They turn their

attention back to the racks of comics. PAUL pulls one out

called " G-Men'. On the cover it shows an agent, not unlike

ZOIL, shooting an alien not unlike PAUL.

You read this one?

No.

It's a good one. Take it. Go on.

It's a gift.

Thanks Paul.

88.

KEITH stuffs it down his trousers. PAUL laughs. We hear MRS.

NASH calling from the street.

I gotta go.

Catch you later, Keith Nash.

GRAHAM and CLIVE approach. CLIVE has a long sword shaped box

under his arm and a big grin on his face.

Who was that?

Keith Nash. How much was that?

$299.99. It's made of a low grade

Turkish alloy.

What did you get, speccy?

X-Men action figure.

Jesus Cheeeerist.

EXT. COMIC SHOP - DAY

GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL exit the comic shop. PAUL waves to

KEITH NASH, who now sits outside, on a bench, with his

MOTHER. The boys walk up the street, seconds later, HAGGARD

and O'REILLY step out of a store, eating bags of candy.

MRS. NASH

Don't lie, Keith.

I'm not lying.

MRS. NASH

Oh, come on now, Keith. If you

carry on like this, you'll have to

come with me to Dress Barn.

Honestly Mommy, he was an alien and

his name was Paul!

MRS. NASH

Whoever hard of an alien called

Paul?

89.

HAGGARD is suddenly kneeling at KEITH NASH's side. O'REILLY

stands nearby.

What did you say, kid?

MRS. NASH

Excuse me. Who are you?

Agent Haggard Ma'am, Secret

Service.

MRS. NASH

Secret Service?!

Kid?

He was in the shop.

Is he still in there?

KEITH shakes his head.

Did he say where he was going?

KEITH looks at his comic. The ZOIL style agent, shooting the

PAUL style alien. He looks back at HAGGARD and points him in

the entirely wrong direction.

South. Toward New Mexico, huh?

KEITH nods. HAGGARD stands, his mind racing. He looks

meaningfully at O'REILLY not noticing the RV rumbling up the

street behind him with CLIVE at the wheel.

We've got him man! We're going to

get a fucking promotion.

You did good kid. Want a candy?

No thanks.

Let's go.

The two agents rush off.

What about Zoil?

90.

Screw Zoil!

EXT. WOODS - DAY

MOSES BEHE kicks at the remains of the campfire. He bends

down and picks something up. It is Ruth's handkerchief, now

stained with dirt and blood. He screws it into his shaking

hand. An engine roars. He looks up to see the RV rumbling up

the road. It turns onto the Eastbound Highway. MOSES' pick up

is parked about 200 yards away. MOSES starts to lumber

towards it as fast as he can, which isn't very fast.

EXT. STREET - DAY

HAGGARD and O'REILLY sprint up to their vehicles.

ZOIL (O.S.)

Where the hell do you think you're

going?

HAGGARD can't hide his frustration.

We picked up a lead, sir. Little

kid in the town said he saw an

alien. Said he was heading toward

New Mexico.

And you were just gonna take off?

Thought it best to take the

initiative, sir. We were going to

radio you.

Well now, that's mighty civil of

you. We have a chain of command. I

expect you to abide by it. Where

d'you say he was headed?

New Mexico sir.

Well, then let's move it.

They scramble.

Oh, and Haggard? Don't go getting

ideas about your station again.

ZOIL gets into his car leaving HAGGARD looking pissed.

91.

INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - DAY

MOSES drives, Ruth's bloody handkerchief gripped between his

hands and the wheel. He listens to his police scanner.

VOICE (O.S.)

Zoil, what the hell's going on?

ZOIL (O.S.)

They've double back sir. They're

heading toward New Mexico.

VOICE (O.S.)

You better be right about this,

Zoil. I'm getting a little tired of

this shit. I want that little

fucker's brain in a jar by sundown.

MOSES smiles darkly.

Looks like you're going the wrong

way, Agent Zoil. That's what

happens when you don't got the Lord

on your side.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

MOSES BEHE's pick up roars through shot, revealing a large

roadside sign proclaiming LUCIFER'S CUT PRICE FIREWORK

WAREHOUSE. Creep in on the sign.

INT. RV - DAYBREAK

The RV is parked outside the firework warehouse. RUTH and

PAUL sit opposite each other at the dining table. RUTH is

holding the X-Men action figure, Storm. PAUL watches her.

He likes you, y'know?

Graham? D'you think?

What are you, blind?

Beat.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Sorry.

Beat.

What you got there, a stigmatism?

92.

RUTH nods.

You know you can get on operation

for that, right?

Papa said the Lord would fix it.

Guess that's not gonna happen,

seeing as we're living in a

gigantic godless universe, with no

hope of salvation.

Hey, I don't know categorically

that it's godless. I just said

" probably'.

Oh, that's a relief.

Look, the way you're feeling now,

that's why religion appeared in the

first place. It's like existential

Prozac. Imagine being five year

sold and having no adults around to

tell you why it snows or what trees

are for. That's how it is for much

of humanity. Faith is a night-

light. It illuminates the scary

corners, fills the gaps, makes the

universe easier to comprehend.

Thing is, it's okay not to know

everything. I mean, who knows

what's really out there? Did you

know astrophysicists recently

identified the equation for the

creation of matter?

Yes.

Oh. Well, then you get it, right?

If they have the theory, who's to

say at some point in the future

they won't put it into practice and

who's to say someone else didn't do

that 13.5 Billion years ago and

that's how the universe came to be?

Course, then we get the eternal

problem of who created the creator

but that's a whole other car park.

I think Shakespeare said it best.

"There's more in Heaven and earth

than is dreamt of in your

philosophy Horatio".

93.

What did you call me?

Horatio. It's from Hamlet. You

know, the Prince of Denmark?

Denmark has a municipal population

of 508,691.

PAUL blinks.

Anyway, if there is a God, didn't

he create doctors and hospitals and

scalpels and shit, so he wouldn't

have to go round fixing people's

lazy eyeballs?

I suppose so.

The eye is a delicate and complex

thing, Ruth. You should get it

taken care of.

RUTH smiles. PAUL smiles back. RUTH looks out of the window,

just as PAUL reaches out to touch her face.

They're back.

PAUL withdraws his hand. GRAHAM and CLIVE are approaching the

RV clutching a large firework. They climb aboard.

Perfect.

What are you going to do with this?

Phone home.

INT. ZOIL'S CAR - DAY

ZOIL!

ZOIL jumps but gathers his composure quickly.

Yes, sir?

94.

Satellite's come up with a data

analysis on all the traffic coming

out of Prospect in the last 5

hours. There was only one RV, and

guess what, nimrod?

It wasn't going to New Mexico?

That's a three pointer Agent Zoil.

You better spin your ass around.

You got some serious catching up to

do. Don't make me come out there.

No, sir. Where are they headed? If

we gun it, maybe we can get the

drop on their destination.

They're on the 50, heading towards

Gillette.

What else is around there?

Not much. Thunder Basis, Bethlehem

Creek.

Bethlehem Creek?

Holy shit!

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

ZOIL's motorcade pulls a spectacular U-turn and heads back up

the highway in the opposite direction.

INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - DAYBREAK

MOSES listens intently to his scanner.

VOICE (O.S.)

You don't think she's sill there,

do you?

MOSES smiles.

95.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

MOSES BEHE's pick-up truck pulls a similarly spectacular turn

and heads in a different direction.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - EVENING

Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming

GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL stare through the window of the

RV at the farmhouse glimpsed in the first scene.

You don't think she's still there

do you?

That's what you're going to find

out for me.

Us?

I can't just knock can I? What if

she's moved on and someone else

answers? I'm sick of people

fainting on me. I'll hang back with

my buddy Ruth, you two make first

contact. Just enjoy it.

What shall we say if it's her?

We're here with the alien that

killed your dog sixty years ago?

Yes. Hurry up, there's going to be

a really big storm in exactly 34

minutes.

How do you know?

It's my job to know.

EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

GRAHAM knocks on the door.

Hello?

Knock again.

96.

VOICE (O.S.)

Who's there?

Tara Walton?

VOICE (O.S.)

Leave me alone!

Okay.

GRAHAM goes to leave. CLIVE stops him.

Miss Walton, I'm the writer, Clive

Gollings and this is my friend and

colleague, Graham Willy. We're from

England and we're here with the

alien that killed your dog 60 years

ago.

Silence. The sound of multiple locks. The door opens to

reveal a woman (68). Grey, dishevelled but with fire in her

eyes. She scowls at GRAHAM and CLIVE.

What is this, some kind of joke?

It's no joke.

PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE.

Hello Tara.

TARA's faces sickens. She falls backwards into the house.

Aw nuts.

INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY

GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL all sit on a sofa. TARA sits

opposite, staring at PAUL.

Maybe I should make some tea.

Where are my manners? I never

really have guests. Nobody comes up

here. I go whole weeks without

seeing a soul.

97.

TARA goes to the kitchen. She can be seen from where they are

sitting. She turns the gas on and strikes a cooking match.

PAUL looks pained, struggling for something to say.

Can I do anything to help?

TARA stand in the kitchen doorway, the lit match in her hand.

PAUL stands and walks toward her, she watches him.

I've only just stopped believing in

you, y'know? Spent a very long time

trying to convince folk about what

happened that night. My parents, my

friends. Everyone thought I was

mad. They told me it was a meteor

that squashed little Paul. Took me

away and did tests they did, said

it was for cosmic radiation. They

said I was concussed,

hallucinating, but I knew you were

real. I pulled you from that

spaceship myself. Sat with you till

the men came and took you away. If

Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he

would have seen you too. They kept

telling me I'd imagined it but I

knew different. Pop tried to

understand but they filled his head

with " delayed this' and " post-

traumatic that'. He just used to

smile and say " there, there Tara'.

He got sick when I was seventeen

and died a few years later. I

inherited this place. Word got out

about my story not long after it

happened, so I didn't really have

any friends. Kids used to throw

stones at the house and call me

names. I just kinda retreated into

myself. I'd spend whole nights up

on the roof, staring at the sky,

hoping to catch a glimpse of you

again. I always believed that one

day you" d come back and here you

are.

The match flame reaches her fingers, she shakes it out.

Listen to me gabbing. Milk and

sugar?

I'm so sorry.

What for?

98.

For killing your dog and ruining

your life.

That doesn't matter. Don't you see?

You're real. I was right and all

those folk that said I was crazy?

Well, they can all go fuck

themselves.

It's good to see you, Tara.

The tinkle of glass. Something hits the floor. A tear gas

canister spins at their feet, spewing thick fog.

Now, where do you suppose that came

from?

Fuck a duck! Get out!

Shit!

Tara, where's the back door?

In back.

The gang bustle out of the room just as the front door

splinters inward, revealing O'REILLY in a gas mask.

INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY

The gang quickly barricade the door of the next room and

continue on toward the back of the house. They find the back

door, just as it is opened by ZOIL. The gang freeze. PAUL

vanishes, then reappears right next to ZOIL, putting his hand

across ZOIL's forehead.

Paul, wait-

A burst of psychic images explode into ZOIL's head. The agent

and the alien fall on the ground in an exhausted heap.

Clive?

Yes?

A little help?

99.

CLIVE picks PAUL up. HAGGARD approaches, gun drawn.

Freeze, space monkey!

We're cut off.

Storm cellar!

TARA opens a nearby door and motions them down some stairs,

as HAGGARD fires wildly. Crockery explodes around them.

Godammit Haggard!

INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. CELLAR - DAY

The gang descend into a dim room. It is full of UFO

paraphernalia. Models, toys, books, souvenirs from every UFO

hot spot in the land. One the wall is the " Take Me To Your

Dealer' poster. PAUL sees it.

Not a fucking cent.

INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY

ZOIL comes to. He sees HAGGARD at the cellar door. Screeching

brakes draw his attention as MOSES BEHE's truck skids up. He

gets out, shotgun in hand.

Oh great!

EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

TEAM PAUL climb out of the cellar and start to run towards

the RV, PAUL still in CLIVE's arms. It starts to rain.

Come on!

Ow, my shins!

INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY

ZOIL sees MOSES run round to the front of the farmhouse.

Help me up!

100.

INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY

O'REILLY sees TEAM PAUL running toward the RV from the front

room. He levels his pistol at PAUL and squints.

EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

TEAM PAUL reach the RV and start to board, just as MOSES BEHE

lumbers into view.

RUTH!

Papa?

PAUL grabs RUTH's hand.

Come on.

(levelling his shotgun)

Take your hands off her, devil!

INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY

O'REILLY find his mark. Pull back to reveal he is stood by

the kitchen door, through which we see the cooker, the simmer

of gas in the air.

Ready or not.

He fires.

KA-BOOM!!!

O'REILLY is vaporized in a ball of orange fire.

EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

The farmhouse explodes. ZOIL and HAGGARD who are only just

clear, hit the deck, covering their heads. MOSES is knocked

off his feet as flaming wood and debris rain down.

INT. RV - DAY

I'll drive!

Punch it!

101.

The RV roars into life, reversing out onto the road. CLIVE

pulls a spectacular U-turn, sending the passengers flying.

GRAHAM lands in TARA's arms, RUTH in PAUL's. RUTH and GRAHAM

exchange glances. Dumb luck. TARA straightens herself and

looks out of the RV at her destroyed home.

My weed!

EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

ZOIL is blackened and dazed, draped over HAGGARD's shoulder.

His eyes focus on a figure in the near distance. MOSES BEHE

picks himself up and lumbers off towards his truck. HAGGARD

drops ZOIL and runs to his car.

Damnit Haggard, wait!

HAGGARD takes off. ZOIL staggers to his car and with great

difficulty, takes off in pursuit, narrowly avoiding MOSES

BEHE's truck. Lightening flashes. Loud thunder.

INT. RV - DAY

CLIVE floors it. RAIN lashes down. The sky is almost black.

Your dad's persistent, isn't he?

You have no idea.

CLIVE sees their pursuers in his wing mirror.

I think we have a problem.

What do we do?

Go left.

What?

GO LEFT!

CLIVE hauls the wheel left. The RV leaves the road and

bounces across the scrub. TEAM PAUL hang on for dear life.

102.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

HAGGARD, ZOIL and MOSES follow the RV across the scrub.

INT. ZOIL'S CAR - EVENING

What the hell is he doing?!

VOICE (O.S.)

Zoil. Progress report!

Sir, I-

INT. HAGGARD'S CAR - EVENING

In pursuit, sir.

Who the hell is this?

Haggard, sir. Agent Zoil has been

compromised. I'm assuming command.

ZOIL (O.S.)

Now wait a goddamn minute!

I don't give a shit who's in

command. Where' my fucking

mooncoon?!

Just ahead of me sir. We're heading

East across scrubland just North of

Mitchell Creek.

I don't wanna hear from either of

you jokers until that little mother

fucker is under glass.

Yes sir!

HAGGARD floors it. He is manic and wild eyed.

103.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

We see the chase from above, the RV is in the lead, gaining

behind them, is HAGGARD, followed by ZOIL, then MOSES.

HAGGARD draws level. He looks up into CLIVE's eyes.

INT. RV - DAY

They're trying to overtake.

Don't let him get past.

Shall I ram him?

RUTH/TARA/GRAHAM/PAUL

YES!

CLIVE wrenches the wheel hard to the left.

EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

The RV nudges the BLACK SEDAN which spins out of control and

skids to a stop, ZOIL and MOSES scream past. HAGGARD turns

the engine over. Nothing. He yells. Lightening explodes

overhead, hail pings and bounces off the hood.

INT. RV - EVENING

What are we doing exactly?

Immense pressure and temperature

drop. High winds, circulating in

the troposphere, two opposed fronts

clashing. Oh, this is going to be a

good one.

A GOOD WHAT?!

RUTH stares out of the window.

Oh my God.

104.

EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

A massive black funnel extends from the sky about half a mile

ahead of the chase. It rakes the ground, reducing a small

farm building to a million splinters.

INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - EVENING

INT. ZOIL'S CAR - DAY

ZOIL is sat mouth agape.

-Shit!

INT. RV - EVENING

CLIVE swerves to avoid a grain silo, which comes bouncing

across the ground toward them.

Are you sure you know what you're

doing?!

Twenty seconds.

Paul, we'll get sucked right up.

Stay on target.

A branch smacks on the windshield, cracking it.

Paul!

Stay on target.

EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

The grain silo bounces close to ZOIL's car, he swerves to

avoid it and stops. MOSES pulls up just ahead. MOSES and ZOIL

get out of the vehicles, almost unable to stand against the

wind and debris. They watch the RV, now a good distance in

front, heading for the heart of the tornado.

105.

He's insane!

RUTH!

HAGGARD's car screams past. ZOIL grabs his radio.

Haggard, stand down. Stand down!

HAGGARD (O.S.)

He's mine. I can do this!

Haggard, it's suicide.

EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

PAUL?

NOW!

The funnel suddenly evaporates into the sky, leaving the path

ahead clear and oddly calm.

It's gone!

Where did it go?

EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

ZOIL watches amazed. He almost smiles.

Son of a bitch!

ZOIL looks at the sky. His face drops.

Haggard. Wait a minute!

An engine revs nearby. ZOIL turns to see MOSES BEHE pull off

in pursuit.

MR. BEHE!

(into is radio)

Damnit, hang back, hang back!

106.

HAGGARD (O.S.)

You're not running this show any

more Zoil. You had your chance.

Haggard, he knows what he's doing.

HAGGARD (O.S.)

So do I.

It's a trap!

INT. RV - EVENING

They're still coming!

WHAT ARE WE DOING TO DO?

Ruth, why don't you count back from

10?

Okay. 10...9...

Back where I'm from, tornadoes are

part of our daily life. We've

learnt how to live with them, how

to understand them.

They're gaining!

We've learnt to anticipate their

behavior, know their personalities,

know when they're playing games.

3...

What games?

2...

Hide and seek?

1...

107.

CLIVE looks into his wing mirror, just as the tornado snakes

down out of the sky between them and HAGGARD.

Great Caesar's ghost!

How did you do that? How did you

know?

Evolution baby.

EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

The tornado touches down hear HAGGARD's car. He barely has

time to scream before his is lifted into the vortex.

INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - EVENING

A wide eyed MOSES yanks hard on the wheel, spinning the truck

round, heading back in the opposite direction.

EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

MOSES's truck hurtles past ZOIL's car.

MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus!

ZOIL looks back toward the no unreachable RV.

INT. RV - DAY

We've lost them.

TEAM PAUL erupt into cheers. PAUL jumps in the air and

whoops. He high five GRAHAM and pats CLIVE on the back.

GRAHAM embraces RUTH and tries to kiss her, she pulls away.

Sorry.

Wait, what about Papa?

I only saw one car following us.

Where's Tara?

TARA comes out of the toilet.

108.

The bulb's gone in there.

That was just awesome. Amazing

driving Clive. It was like G.T.A.

but potentially fatal. Wasn't it,

Clive? Clive?

A knocking and a gurgling sound is coming from the engine.

Oh no.

EXT. SMALL ROAD - EVENING

The RV splutters to a halt. Steam rises from the radiator. It

whines, coughs and dies. Cut to TEAM PAUL stood around

surveying their fallen companion. A single bullet hold in the

grill, reveals the cause of her downfall.

There goes the deposit.

Fare thee well friend. You were a

faithful and mighty steed.

She rode that storm with a bullet

in her heart and didn't stop until

we we're safe.

If there is a benevolent creator

watching over everything then may

he, she or it bless the 1985

Holiday Rambler, Imperial.

Everyone looks to PAUL for his comment but he is not there.

Paul?

PAUL (O.S.)

We're here.

PAUL is stood away from the RV at the foot of a small hill.

He starts to climb. The others follow. Crane up as TEAM PAUL

climb the hill to reveal a sight familiar to anyone who has

seen Close Encounters Of The Third Kind...

DEVIL's TOWER

Of course!

109.

INT. ZOIL'S CAR - EVENING

ZOIL drives. Scanning the landscape. Searching.

Zoil! What the hell is going on?

We got hit by a twister, sir.

Haggard's dead.

What about the other one?

I lost him when the ranch exploded.

Jesus Christ, Zoil, this has been

one fuck up after another. I should

have handled it myself. I want that

little bastard dead by midnight

tonight or you'll be working

security in a convention centre.

Now where's that RV?

ZOIL's eyes widen. Parked on the roadside is the RV.

Zoil? ZOIL?

ZOIL is staring at DEVIL'S TOWER.

EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER - DAY

TEAM PAUL hike towards the tower.

What you may not know is on the

outside of the tower they bolted a

series of ladders, all the way to

the top, put there by William

Rogers in 1893. He was the first

man to climb the tower.

I climbed up there in 1976. Thought

it would make a good site for some

UFO spotting. Turns out I wasn't

the only one.

We call them IFOs.

Cute.

110.

I-thank-you.

EXT. SMALL ROAD - DUSK

ZOIL opens the trunk of his car. He pulls out a large piston,

spare ammo and a webbing pack which he slings around his

shoulder. He sets off up the hill.

EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

TEAM PAUL are walking round the tower. As they round the

corner the landscape changes, the trees give way to a piece

of open pasture flanked by pine forest, the tower opens

itself up slightly, a perfect natural amphitheatre.

This is it.

PAUL takes out the firework, Zippo and cigarettes from his

back pack. He lights his last cigarette and takes a drag.

I'll miss these.

PAUL takes the firework a little way off and sticks it in the

ground. He crouches down and lights the touch paper with the

cigarette, then scampers back to the gang. Beat. The firework

rises into the sky. It explodes. The star-burst is massive

and bright red, it illuminates the tower.

Pretty.

What now?

We wait.

A light appears in the sky some way off.

PAUL (CONT'D)

That was quick.

EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. FOREST - NIGHT

ZOIL runs through the bush, fast, like a wild animal. His

face fixed with serious intent, gun in one hand, torch in the

other.

111.

EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

TEAM PAUL watch as the ethereal light draws nearer.

Spotlights cut through the night, searching beneath.

EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. FOREST - NIGHT

ZOIL leaps a fallen tree. Ahead, through the trees, he sees

an ethereal glow. He pulls the slide back on his pistol.

EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

The lights are really close now. They are accompanied by a

deep rumble. A very earthly sound. Rotor blades.

Wait a minute...

A HELICOPTER swoops in to land, kicking dust and debris into

the air. TEAM PAUL turn back to the woods but are stopped by

the sight of a torch getting nearer.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Oh shit.

Behind them, the HELICOPTER powers down. The door opens.

Well, whaddya know? Small world.

VOICE appears flanked by two faceless, heavily armed

SOLDIERS. They level their weapons, just as ZOIL bursts

through the trees behind them.

PAUL!

Lorenzo?!

PAUL spins round. We go into slow motion. ZOIL fires. The

bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the

bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the

bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes

past him, slamming into one of the soldiers.

ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second

shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He

leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the

cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his

shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward,

holding a smoking gun.

It was you! You told him. I

should've known.

112.

You've never made a mistake in your

life. That's why I put you in

charge of this fucking mission.

He's my friend! I've known him for

twenty years. He introduced me to

my wife damnit!

You stupid son of a bitch. In five

years, you could have been where I

am.

I don't want to be where you are.

Too bad, seeing as I'm the one

hold'ng all the cards and when I

say "cards", I of course mean big

fucking gun.

VOICE points his gun at PAUL.

How'd you find me?

It was pretty easy once we got a

fix on the geek-mobile. Wasn't hard

to figure out where you were

headed. You always did have a flare

for the dramatic.

PAUL nods, a sad smile creeping across his mouth.

Let's go.

TARA stands in front of PAUL, then RUTH, then GRAHAM then

CLIVE, who summons every ounce of bravery in his body.

He's not going anywhere.

Be honest with yourself, two

scoops. What is it that you think

you can possibly bring to the table

at this stage in the game?

CLIVE reaches beyond his back and produces his KATANA SWORD,

he holds it like a proud Samurai.

Blind fury.

The blade falls off.

113.

Bloody low grade Turkish alloy.

Step aside, you fat nerd.

Graham, his this man.

CLIVE steps aside. GRAHAM slams his fist into the face of the

unsuspecting VOICE. He staggers back but rallies quickly,

blocking GRAHAM's second blow and delivering a heavy rebuke.

RUTH leaps onto VOICE's back and starts pummeling his head.

Leave him alone!

VOICE hits out at RUTH. GRAHAM renews his attack.

Leave her alone!

VOICE throws them off and comes face to face with TARA.

Leave them alone.

WHAM! She whacks VOICE across the face with a large stick.

You're not taking him away again.

He staggers backwards and falls to the ground, unconscious.

Thank you, Tara.

Don't mention it.

PAUL rushes to ZOIL who lies on the ground, wounded.

The things I do for you, huh?

You know I appreciate it.

Do you have any idea how difficult

it was to catch you guys?

Let me take a look at that. Ruth,

shine the torch down here?

RUTH grabs a torch and steps in behind PAUL.

114.

BLAM! RUTH lurches forward, suddenly limp. Everyone turns to

see MOSES BEHE, shotgun smoking in his and. His face white,

his eyes wide.

Oh Lord, Ruth. My little Ruth.

Noooooooooo!

GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of

blood around her mouth.

I...I never meant to shoot her. I

was aiming for the goblin.

He's not a goblin he's from another

planet.

But he can't be. He... he...

He's an alien you stupid man! Oh

Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

I should have never persuaded you

to come with us.

RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly.

What, and miss all this? Graham,

I've lived more in the last 48

hours that I ever did in that

trailer park. Isn't that what you

said living was all about? Right

now? This conversation? That tree?

My next cheeseburger? I'm not

afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold

though. Hey, where is everybody?

RUTH shudders and dies. TARA and ZOIL look aghast. GRAHAM

buries his head in RUTH's hair. CLIVE, his eyes are filled

with tears, puts his and on GRAHAM's shoulder.

What have I done? I'm sorry. I'm so

sorry.

A shadow is cast across RUTH. Everyone looks up to see PAUL,

silhouetted against the moon. His eyes glint.

There is no way this thing isn't

gonna end happy.

115.

PAUL drops to his knee and places his hands on RUTH's chest.

MOSES drops his shotgun and lumbers over, distraught.

Get away from her! Don't you touch

my little girl.

CLIVE holds out a hand to stop MOSES. He obeys. The air hums,

charged with static. PAUL's skin ripples with color. Everyone

watches transfixed. RUTH's eye flickers and opens. With some

difficulty, she sits up and takes off her glasses. She blinks

both shining, healthy eyes.

Ruth, are you okay?

I think so. Is anyone hungry? I

really feel like a cheese burger.

Relief and joy spreads through group. MOSES falls to his

knees and sobs. He feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up

to see PAUL.

Thank you.

RUTH and GRAHAM hug. She smiles at him.

You can kiss me now.

They kiss with awkward passion. Everyone smiles then after a

bit become uncomfortable and a bit grossed out.

Looks like the geek shall inherit

the earth.

CLICK CLICK.

The group turn to see VOICE, upright, pointing his gun.

I wouldn't say-

SPLAT.

A large spaceship lands hard on top of VOICE. Everyone looks

shocked. PAUL, GRAHAM and CLIVE exchange a look.

Happens to the best of us.

EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

Some time has passed, a number of PAUL style aliens are now

present.

116.

One of them uses a big hose to clean the remains of VOICE

from the hull of the ship. Another two help the now healed

soldier to their feet, patting them on the back and shaking

their hands. The atmosphere is amiable.

TEAM PAUL look at one another. ZOIL and MOSES have joined

them. PAUL kisses and hugs RUTH.

I'm sorry I frightened you so much

your hair turned white.

You didn't frighten me. You freed

me. You helped me see the light.

Take care of her big man.

I will sir. God be with you.

Whatever dude.

They high five. PAUL turns to ZOIL, whose arm is in a

makeshift sling and shakes his hand.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Lorenzo Zoil, you're a good man.

Say bye to Karen for me.

Safe trip Short Round.

PAUL turns to GRAHAM and CLIVE. He pulls JELVA - ALIEN QUEEN

OF THE VARVAK from his pocket and hands it to them.

You can keep it.

Cool. Okay.

What did you think?

Yeah. Three tits, awesome. Although

you know what? Sometimes, less is

more.

The boys nod.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Thank you.

No, thank you.

117.

You are, and always will be, our

friend.

Come here you fucking geeks.

They hug. He takes in incandescent orb from his pocket.

PAUL (CONT'D)

This is a self-sustaining light

orb. Might come in handy, you know,

if a bulb goes.

TARA is waiting for her goodbye but PAUL ignores her. He face

drops as he walks to his ship. He turns to her.

PAUL (CONT'D)

You coming?

What?

I ruined your life Tara. Think I

owe you a new one.

TARA takes PAUL's hand.

I don't have my toothbrush.

Baby, where we're going, you won't

need teeth.

TARA frowns then follows PAUL aboard. PAUL and TARA stand in

the doorway. One of the other ALIENS comes out of a small

room behind them, speaking in a strange tongue.

Subtitle: THE BULB'S GONE IN THERE.

As the door slowly closes, GRAHAM and CLIVE give PAUL the

CE3K salute. PAUL gives them the finger. The boys laugh,

tears in their eyes. The ship lifts off into the sky. GRAHAM,

CLIVE, RUTH, MOSES and ZOIL watch them go. The light form the

ship gradually fades, leaving them in darkness. Pause.

That was good, wasn't it?

INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY

We are at Comic-Con the following year. We come to rest on a

long line of people. Sat behind a table are GRAHAM and CLIVE.

They look more confident, cooler. CLIVE is talking to a short

woman in an EWOK costume. He pats her on the ass as she walks

away. All around them are stacks of their new novel: PAUL.

118.

A banner hangs behind, displaying the cover, GRAHAM's own

rendering of their alien friend. They sign copies. The

PUBLICIST mills around, looking very pleased.

Just one item per person please.

He winks at the boys. RUTH rushes up to GRAHAM, she is

dressed as Storm from X-Men and pushes a customized buggy, in

which sits a baby dressed as Professor X.

Hey.

Hey babe. You okay?

I'm just taking Tara over to the

autograph pavilion. Michael Biehn's

here!

Oh, say hi from us, won't you?

RUTH kisses GRAHAM. Two nerds approach.

Uh... were you... did you?

There you go.

SECURITY MAN (O.S.)

Next in line please.

Uh... were you... did you?

There you go.

Guys, if you've had your book

signed please move on.

Tilt up to reveal the security man. It is none other than

former Special Agent LORENZO ZOIL. CRANE up to reveal the

whole convention floor.
