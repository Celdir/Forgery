SUPER ON BLACK:

LONGVIEW STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, TEXAS, 2003.

FADE IN ON:

INT.   DEATH ROW/CELL - DAWN

START TIGHT ON MARCUS WRIGHT. He's an intense, powerful man,

20's-30's, his head shaven. Marcus stares INTO CAMERA with a

resigned expression. We hear the voice of a PRIEST:

CAMERA PULLS BACK, straight up. MARCUS lies in his cot,

staring at the ceiling. He's smoking a CIGARETTE. This

OVERHEAD ANGLE reveals a PRIEST with a BIBLE, in a folding

chair beside him. A CHESS SET, stacks of BOOKS, WRITING

MATERIALS in the cell. TWO GUARDS wait, shackles in hand.

MARCUS has no interest in scripture. He blows a cloud of

SMOKE which drifts in the direction of the PRIEST, who blinks

and shuts his bible.

One of the GUARDS unlocks the cell door for--

DR. SERENA KOGAN. She's in her 30's-50's, brilliant,

attractive, but thin and pale, a scarf tied around her head.

She carries a CLIPBOARD. The PRIEST backs off to give her

some privacy with Marcus.

CONTINUED:

Marcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen-- he

notes that her hands are SHAKING.

MARCUS looks up from the form, takes in the scarf covering

her sparse hair.

MARCUS meets her eyes.      She studies him a beat.

With that sarcastic comment, he SIGNS HIS NAME-- we see the

words "PROJECT ANGEL" at the top of DENSE TYPE on the form.

SERENA takes the clipboard, starts to rise.         She touches his

hand for a moment.

CONTINUED: (2)

THE GUARD sees SERENA out.

INT.   DEATH ROW/CORRIDOR - NIGHT

LOW ANGLE - MARCUS' CHAINED ANKLES clank as the GUARDS lead

him down the corridor, past PRISONERS in their cells; some

avert their eyes, others give a nod or raise a fist.

MARCUS stares straight ahead, taking deep, steady breaths,

struggling not to succumb to fear.

INT.   DEATH ROW/EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT

CLOSE - BUCKLES TIGHTEN... AN ALCOHOL SWAB on MARCUS'

FOREARM... A NEEDLE punctures his skin.

FINGERS turn the VALVE to release the LETHAL CHEMICALS.

CLOSE ON MARCUS' EYES, looking up toward--

THE DEADLY I.V., running into his arm.

From this, he looks toward--

HIS REFLECTION in a one-way mirror, the dim shapes of

WITNESSES beyond.

CONTINUED:

As the lethal injection takes hold, his POV moves to BRIGHT

LIGHTS overhead, losing FOCUS and BLEACHING TO WHITE...

From the WHITE SCREEN, a FACE emerges, backlit, blurred--

it's SERENA. She's in focus for just a moment, leaning INTO

CAMERA-- then moves OUT OF FRAME.

SUPER ON BLACK:

SOUTH-CENTRAL SECTOR, NORTH AMERICA, 2018

EXT.   CORNFIELD - DUSK

CORNSTALKS as far as the eye can see, rustling in a summer

breeze. FIGURES are moving within the FIELD. We only make

them out in SILHOUETTE, but all carry HEAVY RIFLES.

INT.   A-10 COCKPIT - DUSK

A COMPUTER TARGETING SCREEN - the FIGURES are HIGHLIGHTED in

this tactical display, as is an OCTAGONAL HATCH into the

ground beneath the corn.

EXT.   CORNFIELD - DUSK

THE FIGURES in the corn look up-- we hear an AIRCRAFT

APPROACH with a JET WHINE--

FWOOM! A MASSIVE CONCUSSION as a BUNKER-BUSTING MISSILE

BORES into the earth at high-velocity, burrowing deep--

--then a HUGE BLAST - FLAME and DIRT are thrown high in the

air, many of the FIGURES blown sky-high.

A FLAMING BODY hits the ground IN FG, FACE TO CAMERA... we

now see it was a STEEL TERMINATOR-- its METAL SKULL BLOWN

OPEN and SCORCHED, its RED EYES SHATTERED.

CONTINUED:

A-10 WARTHOGS-- stubby attack planes-- SCREAM from the sky,

RAKING THE REMAINING FIGURES with CANNON FIRE, BLASTING THEM

to bits. These aircraft no longer bear traditional U.S.

insignia-- they're painted in WILD COLORS, graffiti lettering

says things like: "BOT BLASTER," "KILL FOR CONNOR," "RAGE

AGAINST THE MACHINES," etc... Resistance fighters.

Motley military and civilian CHOPPERS LAND in the CORNFIELD,

disgorging RESISTANCE SOLDIERS. These are human troops in

high-tech HELMETS, carrying slightly futuristic conventional

ASSAULT WEAPONS.

THE WARTHOGS veer off, laying NAPALM in the distance behind

the SOLDIERS. The troops run toward--

--AN OPENING which has been blown into the ground, the

remains of the octagonal hatch where the bunker-buster hit.

A surviving TERMINATOR rises from the SINGED CORN, FIRES its

PLASMA RIFLE--

--DROPPING A SOLDIER. His comrades FIRE EXPLOSIVE BULLETS--

and BLOW THE ROBOT APART. The LEADER of this assault group

waves his soldiers to enter the dark hatchway.

INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT

COLLAPSED CEILINGS, FLAMES, a high-tech installation in

ruins; RED LIGHTING, distinctive of Skynet environments.

SOLDIERS flick on HELMET LAMPS and make their way carefully

inside-- pretty deserted. They kick aside rubble to enter--

INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/ROBOTIC ROOM - NIGHT

HELMET BEAMS play over BANKS OF ELECTRONICS and--

--a dozen fixed, INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS-- not remotely HUMANOID--

engaged in mysterious tasks, mechanical arms at work.

THE SOLDIERS rake the room with GUNFIRE-- MACHINERY

collapses, SPARKS from EXPLODING CIRCUITRY.

INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Deeper into the complex, A HEAVY DOOR BLOWS off its hinges.

CONTINUED:

SOLDIERS move from cover and through the blown door.

INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

TUBES and FIBER-OPTIC CABLES run into DOZENS OF GLASS

CYLINDERS filled with translucent PINK LIQUID. The SOLDIERS

make their way in, alert-- but nothing's moving in here.

THE TEAM LEADER peers into a cylinder, aims his HEADLAMP at--

--A small MASS OF TISSUE floating inside, connected to a

dense network of FIBER-OPTIC CABLES... it's a HUMAN BRAIN.

THE TEAM LEADER recoils-- but before he can say more, the

ROOM SHAKES with a DEAFENING ROAR.

EXT.   CORNFIELD - NIGHT

A huge ESCAPE SHIP rises straight up from an open HATCHWAY.

Nearby TROOPS crouch and FIRE after it. THE SHIP PIVOTS in

mid-air and ROARS OFF, SOLDIERS dodging the ENGINE BLAST.

INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

THE TEAM LEADER speaks into his headset. The OTHER SOLDIERS

inspect the many CYLINDERS, react in horror and shock.

As he speaks, CAMERA FINDS a GREEN LED on the ceiling-- which

suddenly FLASHES RED and BLINKS RAPIDLY--

EXT.   CORNFIELD - NIGHT

WIDE - AN IMMENSE SUBTERRANEAN BLAST causes a few hundred

yards square to SWELL and then COLLAPSE.

CONTINUED:

JETS of FLAME, SMOKE and DIRT RISE in the aftermath.

INT.   CHOPPER - NIGHT

A PANICKED PILOT on the radio:

EXT.   CORNFIELD - NIGHT

SOLDIERS above ground help the WOUNDED to EVAC CHOPPERS.

IN FG, FIND the STEEL SKULL of the dead TERMINATOR.

EXT.   CORNFIELD - DAY

SAME ANGLE-- the TERMINATOR now half-sunk in mud. A FIELD

MOUSE has nested in its skull cavity, seeking shelter from

RAINDROPS.

Months have passed, the season changed-- CORN long dead, a

black stubble. RAIN falls.

A PATCH OF MUD stirs-- something below is moving.       The MUD

roils, seeming to assume a HUMAN SHAPE...

EYES OPEN, looking around in shock, the naked FIGURE is so

drenched in mud we can't recognize it at first. The figure

rises, looks up at the sky, and FALLING RAIN washes away mud

from his face... it's MARCUS WRIGHT. He opens his mouth,

makes a few GUTTURAL NOISES... then SCREAMS.

CAMERA PULLS UP from MARCUS' AGONIZED FACE...

EXT.   PLATEAU - EVENING

BARE FEET trudge through the dirt. MARCUS moves along a

slight rise, wrapped in torn and filthy RAGS, mud caked on

his body. Eerie silence. Reaching the edge of a rise, he

sees in the distance--

A DECIMATED CITY, buildings collapsed into rubble.

EXT.   DEAD CITY - NIGHT

MOONLIGHT. THE SKELETON of a large DOG lies on the ground,

partially covered by a dusting of SNOW. It still bears a

rotting COLLAR attached to a CHAIN.

MOVE to a CHAIN-LINK FENCE, partially collapsed, a singed,

faded sign: "BEWARE OF DOG."

WIDER, we're in the low-rent district of this CITY IN RUINS--

rubble, random walls still stand. Hulks of cars, rusted,

windowless. It's been over a decade since the bombs fell.

MARCUS is the only thing alive here. He moves down this

block, picks up a handful of SNOW, brings it to his lips.

A COLLAPSED NEWSSTAND. MARCUS walks past the racks, picks up

a MAGAZINE which crumbles in his hands.

A HUMAN SKELETON, clothes in tatters, is half-buried behind

the collapsed counter. There's a bulge in its shirt pocket.

MARCUS gingerly reaches into the pocket and fishes out a

cellophane-wrapped PACK OF CIGARETTES and a butane LIGHTER.

MARCUS sits on a piece of rubble by the skeleton. He tears

open the packet and puts a dried-out, stale cigarette to his

lips, tries the lighter a few times, finally gets a flame.

He lights the cig, inhales deeply-- he waits for a rush,

feels nothing. He takes a few more drags, increasingly

disappointed, then flicks the cigarette away.

He rises, looks toward a caved-in STOREFRONT, makes out a

clothing store's TATTERED SIGN on the ground, amidst broken

glass: "SALE! GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! EVERYTHING MUST GO!"

INT.   RUINED CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT

FALLEN RACKS, CLOTHES and SHOES covered in years of dust and

rubble. MARCUS, grateful to be rid of the rags, has pulled

on jeans and sneakers, using the CIGARETTE LIGHTER for

illumination. He kicks away some FALLEN CEILING TILES from a

RACK OF ARMY JACKETS. He holds one up-- looks good.

INT.   RUINED BAR - NIGHT

Partially collapsed, a downscale watering hole. Broken

stools, booths, a dead pinball machine. MARCUS, dressed now,

again using the LIGHTER to find his way, sorts through the

broken glass and rubble behind the bar, comes up with--

A DUSTY BOTTLE OF WHISKY.

He unscrews the cap, raises the bottle to a SKELETON on the

floor nearby. Marcus takes a long pull-- and CHOKES,

instantly dizzy. He sinks to the floor, passing out.

MEMORY MONTAGE: quick, fragmentary, impressionistic POVs,

blurred, altered. SFX of HEARTBEATS, a RESPIRATOR.

--WEBS of TUBES and FIBER-OPTICS FILLS THE FRAME.

--GRIDS OF LASER LIGHT scan rapidly INTO CAMERA.

--DIGITAL DISPLAYS blink through murky LIQUID. SERENA moves

INTO FRAME, a look of concentration on her face as she peers

through the LIQUID, INTO CAMERA. She starts to smile.

EXT.   DEAD CITY - DAY

BLUE SKY. TILT DOWN to find MARCUS, who plods on through the

dead city's outskirts. He pauses near a collapsed BUS KIOSK.

A SMILING WOMAN stares out at him from a faded ADVERTISEMENT.

MARCUS studies the woman. She's nothing like Serena, but her

expression recalls the beckoning vision.

CONTINUED:

He runs his hand over the image of her face, pulls away a

chunk of cracked, graffitied GLASS over the poster. Then he

carefully tears the poster to remove the woman's face, folds

the paper, slips it in a pocket and continues on.

EXT.   HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Deserted, CAR HULKS about, crumbling SKELETONS at the wheels.

MARCUS moves down the center of the freeway on this MOONLIT

NIGHT, paying little attention to anything around him. We're

in mostly flat, treeless plains.

From the opposite direction, FIGURES approach, moving through

the darkness. Marcus hurries excitedly toward them, the

first living creatures he's seen. He waves.

The FIGURES pause, turning toward him in unison.

He freezes in his tracks. These aren't humans. They're T-

400s-- PLASTIC-SKINNED TERMINATORS-- armed with PLASMA

RIFLES. They wear a motley collection of found CLOTHING, but

their male humanoid faces are identical, unnatural and

motionless, like masks. Their EYES FLICKER RED as they scan

him.

Marcus backs away, runs.      The T-400s stare after him-- but

don't fire.

ANGLE THROUGH BINOCULAR MASK - MARCUS running for all he's

worth, heading toward the viewer. We hear a muttering VOICE:

ANGLE ON A BOY, scrawny and filthy, in his early to mid

teens. He crouches on the supports of a FREEWAY SIGN.

CONTINUED:

He wears layers of TATTERED, OVER-SIZED CLOTHING.     He

scrambles quickly down from the sign.

AT AN OFF-RAMP, Marcus' pace slows as he moves to get off the

freeway, when--

THE BOY emerges from behind some RUBBLE, holding a HANDGUN in

one hand, a lit OIL LANTERN in the other.

Marcus raises his hands, shakes his head.     The boy looks him

over dubiously.

The boy moves closer, puts down the LANTERN, frisks Marcus

with one hand while holding the gun on him with the other.

THE BOY makes a dubious face, yanks a handful of PAPER SCRAPS

from Marcus' pocket.

THE BOY unfolds the paper scraps in the LANTERN LIGHT--

ANGLE ON PAPER SCRAPS - the WOMAN'S FACE from the poster, a

fragment of a MODEL'S PHOTO from a MAGAZINE AD, a painting of

a FEMALE FACE from a PAPERBACK COVER.

CONTINUED: (2)

THE BOY looks puzzled, intrigued by the pictures. But with

sudden speed, MARCUS GRABS THE BOY'S GUN HAND and wrenches it

hard-- it FIRES into the air. MARCUS gets control of the

gun, wraps one arm around the boy's throat.

The NOISE of a SHOTGUN PUMPING close behind MARCUS--

MARCUS spins to face his attacker, pressing the handgun into

the boy's cheek. He's face to face with--

A GIRL, a couple of years younger than the BOY, training the

shotgun at Marcus' head-- she looks ready to shoot.

THE GIRL shakes her head angrily.   She wears an aged, beloved

BASEBALL CAP with a STAR on it.

She shakes her head slightly, aiming carefully at Marcus'

head, just a few feet away, a slight smile on her face.

MARCUS hooks his foot around the oil lantern and deftly--

CONTINUED: (3)

--BOOTS IT at the GIRL. BURNING OIL spills across her leg,

she cries out and fumbles the shotgun. MARCUS tosses the BOY

at her, the two of them SPRAWL on the ground, the shotgun

falling to one side--

MARCUS quickly snatches up the shotgun.

Using SNOW, the BOY helps the GIRL extinguish the flames from

her clothing.

MARCUS stands over the kids with a gun in each hand.   He

struggles to control anger, speaks quietly.

MARCUS quickly checks the chambers of both the shotgun and

handgun-- indeed, both are empty.

He shoves the handgun in his belt, puts the shotgun down and

kneels to pick up fallen scraps of paper-- a few have caught

FIRE and are incinerated.

THE BOY and GIRL get to their feet, stare at Marcus.

MARCUS shrugs, gestures for her to pick it up.   He still

looks at the PICTURES in his hands.

CONTINUED: (4)

A SPOTLIGHT appears in the distance-- a ROVING HUNTER-KILLER

moving in their direction.

Quickly, automatically, the kids dive for cover behind a WALL

OF DEBRIS. MARCUS looks toward the LIGHT, unaware of danger.

THE BOY bolts from behind cover, grabs MARCUS by the arm--

He drags Marcus back behind the debris wall, just in time--

As the H-K nears, the LIGHT FINDS the BURNING OIL. It FIRES

BLUE PULSES, which CHEW up the asphalt nearby-- then it moves

on, failing to pick out the humans. Marcus is dumbfounded.

The H-K has vanished in the distance. The girl rises.   The

boy-- KYLE-- shakes his head, stays at Marcus' side.

CONTINUED: (5)

STAR gives Marcus a small, reluctant wave.

KYLE points but gets no response. He shrugs, sets off with

Star in that direction. Kyle calls over his shoulder:

MARCUS looks around at the desolate world-- and the two teens

receding ahead of him. After a beat, he follows.

EXT.   HIGHWAY - DAWN

A FALLEN SIGN - "GAS FOOD LODGING."

KYLE, STAR and MARCUS move along the roadside, heading toward

dark BUILDINGS a few hundred yards off near an overpass.

CONTINUED:

KYLE cocks his head at him.

EXT.   REST STOP - DAY

A MEXICAN FAST FOOD JOINT, windows broken, sign collapsed,

near a two-story MOTEL with a COVERED CARPORT. The pavement

is CRACKED, the structures WEATHERED, abandoned for a decade.

MARCUS, KYLE and STAR suddenly rise from a hiding spot by a

DUMPSTER in a parking area. KYLE scans the FAST-FOOD PLACE

with the binoculars, while STAR studies a WATCH she carries.

CONTINUED:

They drop down again.

ONE AEROSTAT patrols the area. It's a surveillance drone the

size of a softball, shiny steel, an inset camera lens with a

RED GLOW. It flies in a geometric pattern, hovering every

few seconds before continuing on. It vanishes around the

corner of the fast-food joint, moving in the direction of the

motel. STAR has been timing its moves.

KYLE and STAR dash for the fast-food entrance, MARCUS just

behind. They round the doorway and--

INT.   FAST FOOD JOINT - DAY

--drop down inside behind an upended table in what was once a

taco place, remnants of Mexican decor.

THROUGH A DIRTY WINDOW, they see the AEROSTAT buzz past,

flying its pattern. It moves on without spotting them, then

takes off in a new direction.

KYLE and STAR set to searching the place, something they've

done many times. They go through trash cans, check behind

the counters and in the kitchen. MARCUS gets up, still

looking out the windows.

She's come up with some UNOPENED PACKETS OF CONDIMENTS from a

bag of TRASH. KYLE trots over.

She nods excitedly, hands him a packet.    He tears it open,

sucks down the contents eagerly.

CONTINUED:

STAR discards one packet, sucks at another-- and immediately

makes a pained face and tosses the packet aside.

MARCUS picks up the packet, looks at it.

STAR and KYLE pause in their eating, stare at him.

MARCUS shrugs modestly.

With obvious reluctance, STAR holds a packet of mustard

toward Marcus.

Marcus gallantly waves it away.

INT.   ABANDONED MOTEL ROOM - DAY

ANGLE IN MIRROR - MARCUS stares at his own reflection in a

cracked MIRROR.

CONTINUED:

STAR closes tattered curtains, plops on the bare bed, ready

for sleep. The room's a mess, GRAFFITI here and there, trash

scattered about; they're not the first squatters who've been

here. THE GUNS and STAR'S WATCH lie on a dresser.

KYLE sits before the TV-- he's scratching STICK FIGURES onto

the screen with a rusted POCKETKNIFE. One is clearly meant

to be him; the smaller one, wearing a baseball cap, is Star.

KYLE plops on the bed next to STAR, who's already out.

MARCUS studies them.

CONTINUED: (2)

CONTINUED: (3)

MARCUS notices now that Kyle is asleep-- it's as if he's

lulled him with a bedtime story. Marcus is oddly touched,

pulls a cover over both the kids. KYLE starts, half-asleep--

So saying, KYLE falls back asleep. MARCUS sighs, moves

through the room, quietly opens a drawer or two and finds--

A BIBLE.

INT.   MOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

AFTERNOON LIGHT, MARCUS sits on the floor by a room door,

shotgun leaned on the wall at his side. He has the bible

open in his lap, head bowed over it. CLOSER-- his eyes are

closed, he's asleep.

THE DOOR OPENS behind him, STAR peers out-- and looks

relieved to see Marcus is still with them. As she takes a

step toward him, he starts awake.

MARCUS relaxes, she sits down beside him.

CONTINUED:

MARCUS shrugs and nods, flips to a random page, squints at

the text.

She's already on her feet.

CLOSE - A PHONEBOOK, minutes later.    We hear MARCUS reading:

STAR sits at his side, looking over his shoulder as he turns

pages. She points to something:

CONTINUED: (2)

Star's face lights up, she nods eagerly, sings along:

STAR is dizzy with emotion, wipes an eye, turning away.

MARCUS puts the phonebook aside, puts a hand on her arm; and

she leans into him for a hug, tears forming in her eyes.

CONTINUED: (3)

MARCUS looks down at her, affected.

EXT.   MOTEL - DAY

AEROSTAT POV - a PIXELLATED ELECTRONIC IMAGE as it patrols

the MOTEL AREA in its geometric pattern. It ZOOMS into the

CARPORT, quickly scanning the abandoned VEHICLES, among which

is an aged, open JEEP WRANGLER, its HOOD UP, parked beside a

customized VAN. The cars are covered in DUST, the TIRES

FLAT, they've been sitting here for a decade.

OBJECTIVE ANGLE - the AEROSTAT zips off on its rounds. After

a moment, the VAN DOOR slides open. MARCUS moves quickly

back to the JEEP, KYLE and STAR behind him.

STAR checks her WATCH while MARCUS goes back to work on the

JEEP'S ENGINE. He's found some tools, already has removed

and cleaned SPARK PLUGS, dismantled the DISTRIBUTOR. KYLE,

meanwhile, returns to INFLATING one of the tires with a

BICYCLE PUMP.

STAR wipes DIRT off the side of the VAN, revealing air-

brushed ARTWORK beneath...

MARCUS looks up from his work to see--

A WHITE UNICORN in a FIELD OF FLOWERS.

EXT.   MOTEL - NIGHT

THE AEROSTAT zips past the CARPORT.   As soon as its gone--

THE JEEP is suddenly PUSHED from the carport, tires somewhat

inflated. MARCUS is on one side of the rear, KYLE on the

other, STAR behind the wheel, the seat moved all the way up.

They get the vehicle to a slight SLOPE, it begins to roll on

its own.

ANGLE IN JEEP

We see it's been hot-wired. STAR has her foot all the way

down on the clutch, now lets up--

THE JEEP BUCKS and SPUTTERS... but CATCHES. As soon as it

does, MUSIC BLARES from the tape deck-- raucous HEAVY METAL,

the aged cassette SPEEDS and SLOWS. MARCUS runs for the

driver's side, but the JEEP is pulling ahead fast.

ANGLE IN JEEP

STAR is staring at the speaker, mesmerized at the sound of

the MUSIC. When she looks out the windshield--

--she's about to HIT A WALL, SQUEALS in terror--

--MARCUS vaults in and pushes her aside, squeezing behind the

wheel, hitting the brakes and throwing the Jeep into neutral.

KYLE hops in back as MARCUS adjusts the seat and FLOORS IT.

THE KIDS are exhilarated as MARCUS zooms out of there,

heading off-road across the plains, LIGHTS OFF, MUSIC LOUD.

CONTINUED:

MARCUS turns the MUSIC DOWN.       He looks up to see--

--THE AEROSTAT, right over their heads, keeping pace with the

vehicle, RED LIGHTS FLASHING.

KYLE rises in back, SWINGS at it with the SHOTGUN BUTT--

THE AEROSTAT deftly dodges the blows.

MARCUS SLAMS on the brakes-- the AEROSTAT stops a few feet

ahead of them, hovering in the air.

MARCUS picks up an X-shaped LUG WRENCH from behind his seat,

rises, taking aim--

--and HURLS THE WRENCH with amazing speed and power--

--it flies like a throwing star and SMASHES the AEROSTAT to

BITS in a shower of SPARKS and METAL.

The three of them stare breathlessly for a moment.

MARCUS flexes his hand, startled at his own strength.

EXT.   TEXAS PLAINS - NIGHT

The JEEP moves off-road, HEADLIGHTS OFF, traveling by

MOONLIGHT. It SWERVES and BUCKS from time to time. MUSIC

PLAYS from the TAPE DECK, something more melodic.

ANGLE IN JEEP - KYLE behind the wheel, having the time of his

life, MARCUS supervising, STAR enjoying the breeze and the

unfamiliar sensation of a moving vehicle.

CONTINUED:

The SONG suddenly GARBLES, turning to NOISE. MARCUS ejects

the tape, pulls it out-- it's unspooled, tangled in the

stereo's guts. THE KIDS groan disappointedly. STATIC from

the radio now... but a FAINT VOICE audible beneath it.

MARCUS FIDDLES with the dial. He can't get the SOUND clear,

rolls through the dial. Varying levels of STATIC, then a

relatively CLEAR VOICE:

STAR points toward the horizon.    Marcus looks up.

KYLE ACCELERATES.

They SCREECH to a halt.

IN THE DISTANCE - a RED GLOW of FLAMES far away. SILHOUETTED

against this, strange FLYING VEHICLES and spindly, spider-

like MACHINES are just visible.

CONTINUED: (2)

HIGH ANGLE - THE JEEP turns away from the conflagration,

moves off in a new direction and vanishes into the darkness.

EXT.   SERVICE STATION - DAWN

HIGH ANGLE - a crumbling SERVICE STATION with a RUSTING

TANKER on flat tires, the cab long gone.   MOVE TO FIND the

JEEP approaching off-road.

THE JEEP pulls to a stop, MARCUS gets out from behind the

wheel and moves to the TANKER. STAR and KYLE, with his

binocs, scan the area for signs of Skynet surveillance.

MARCUS pounds on the TANKER-- a deep echo.

KYLE sniffs the air.

STAR sniffs the air herself, eyes going wide.

They both hop out of the Jeep, running toward the GARAGE,

each carrying their unloaded GUNS.

HIGH ANGLE - from BEHIND THE RUSTING SIGN, an AEROSTAT

appears, aimed at the kids, LIGHTS BLINKING.

INT.   SERVICE STATION - DAWN

KYLE and STAR slither under a partially open GARAGE DOOR.

The space is dark, SMOKE-FILLED... STRIPS OF DRIED MEAT hang

from the hydraulic lift. The two youths look amazed and

delighted. Kyle shoves the gun into his waistband, moves to

the closest strip and PEELS OFF A PIECE, takes a tentative

bite, then gnaws ravenously. Star leans the shotgun against

the wall and follows suit.

MARCUS lifts the garage door and enters, DAWN LIGHT streaming

in behind him.

Marcus squints at something in the darkness.   He takes a step

forward, then grabs Star's arm.

Now KYLE reacts to what Marcus saw, GAGS and SPITS out meat.

He's staring at--

--a dried, severed HUMAN HAND, resting on a GRILLE in the

sunken SERVICE PIT, where a CHARCOAL FIRE smolders.

Star sees it too, turns and RETCHES, just as--

--three animal-like CANNIBALS emerge from the back of the

garage-- two burly, ugly, unshaven MEN and a wild-eyed,

unhealthy-looking WOMAN with matted hair. We'll call them

PIG, BULL and COW. PIG grabs the SHOTGUN, BULL grabs KYLE

and yanks the HANDGUN from his waistband.

COW grabs STAR, shoves her into the center of the garage,

beside Kyle and Bull. Bull tosses the handgun to COW who

keeps it trained on the kids, sizing them up.

CONTINUED:

PIG eyes Marcus, points the shotgun in his face.

MARCUS raises two fingers like a peace sign-- then shoves

them into the barrels of the shotgun. PIG snorts and PULLS

THE TRIGGER-- CLICK.

MARCUS yanks the gun away and tosses it aside, HEAD-BUTTS

Pig, who staggers backward, BLOOD SPRAYING from his nose.

COW points the unloaded HANDGUN at Marcus-- CLICK CLICK.

KYLE and STAR get free of BULL and dash for the exit, they're

out of there in a flash.

BULL CHARGES MARCUS, who dodges him, grabs the man and--

--HURLS HIM HEAD FIRST into the CHARCOAL PIT-- his BODY

SIZZLES against the coals, he SCREAMS and WRITHES.

COW picks up an AXE with two hands and SWINGS it at MARCUS

who GRABS the HANDLE with one hand and YANKS it away.

COW knows she's met her match, turns and flees, heading out

the way Kyle and Star went.

MARCUS advances on PIG and BULL, brandishing the AXE. Pig

squirms back across the floor, wiping BLOOD from his face.

BULL has scrambled out of the coal pit, but is in too much

pain to rise.

CONTINUED: (2)

Marcus looks ready to finish them off-- but reacts to CRIES

from outside, a loud MECHANICAL RUMBLE.

EXT.   SERVICE STATION - DAY

A HARVESTER-- a GIANT INSECT-LIKE TERMINATOR-- is outside the

station. Many times the size of a human being, MULTIPLE ARMS

and LEGS sprout from its thorax, it has multiple CAMERA EYES

on long, swiveling stalks-- it carries KYLE and STAR, the

kids struggle frantically, caught in the harvester's jointed

steel appendages.

One unblinking EYE SCANS KYLE, another STAR; the harvester

produces a NEEDLE from one of its arms, INJECTS the boy-- who

instantly goes limp, unconscious. It does the same to STAR.

As COW emerges--

--THE HARVESTER SPRINGS on her, with startling speed. She

SCREAMS as the enormous terminator hoists her into the air

with the others, INJECTS her and begins moving toward--

--A TRANSPORT. This consists of CONTAINER resembling a semi-

trailer or wheeled dumpster, attached within a FRAMEWORK that

features movable ENGINE PODS and a mysterious ARMATURE at the

front. A STEEL LID in the top of the container OPENS

hydraulically, the Harvester DEPOSITS the HUMAN CAPTIVES

inside, and the LID SLAMS SHUT.

MARCUS has emerged from the garage, still carrying the AXE.

He stays low, hidden behind the tanker, watching as--

--PIG and BULL flee through a back entrance to the garage,

immediately attracting the attention of--

--the Harvester, which sets off in pursuit.

Marcus comes to a decision.    He SPRINTS into the open, toward

the TRANSPORT, and--

--CLAMBERS up the side, hitting the thing at full speed,

using an engine pod to boost himself higher. He's still

short but swings the AXE and--

--hooks the AXE HEAD over the top of the container, like a

grappling hook. He pulls himself up and--

CONTINUED:

--crawls across the roof, to the LID. There's a barred,

reinforced MESH PANEL here, through which he can see--

ANGLE IN TRANSPORT

--about TWENTY HUMAN PRISONERS, unconscious on the steel

floor. Among them are KYLE and STAR. Star MOANS, opens her

eyes briefly and sees--

--MARCUS' SILHOUETTE above her.

Her eyes flutter shut again.

MARCUS struggles to raise the sealed lid, but there's no

purchase available, just a smooth seam. Suddenly--

--the TRANSPORT JERKS. MARCUS nearly loses his footing as

the TRANSPORT STARTS ROLLING forward. He drops to his belly,

seeing that the transport is approaching--

--the HARVESTER, which now carries PIG and BULL, both

unconscious. THE LID OPENS and the Harvester DROPS the two

men INSIDE-- but its camera eyes fail to register Marcus, who

crouches behind the open lid. As the lid BEGINS TO CLOSE,

the Harvester attaches to the armature at the front of the

transport, making itself an aerodynamic part of the machine.

MARCUS THRUSTS THE HEAD OF THE AXE under the closing LID in

order to prevent it from sealing. THE LID grinds against it,

but remains ajar. A moment later--

--THE ENGINE PODS ROTATE DOWNWARD, FIRE and--

--THE TRANSPORT LIFTS OFF THE GROUND. Within moments, the

airborne dumpster has risen hundreds of feet in the air.

EXT.   AERIAL - DAY

MARCUS moves to the edge, looks down in astonishment at the

fallow plains far below. Looking to the side, he sees--

--A PAIR OF HUNTER KILLERS, swooping in quickly to provide an

escort for the slower moving transport.

WIND buffets Marcus, he hangs on for dear life. Clinging to

the top of the transport, he slowly makes his way back toward

the LID. As the transport BANKS, he almost loses his grasp,

dangling for a moment before the craft rights itself.

CONTINUED:

MARCUS reaches under the jammed lid and pulls with all his

might. This thing is really heavy, plus he's fighting the

WIND BLAST. MARCUS hears something behind him--

THE HARVESTER has spotted him and is now prying itself loose

from the armature. Also buffeted by the wind, it starts to

move gingerly down the length of the transport toward Marcus.

MARCUS must let the LID CLOSE. He snatches up the AXE, takes

a couple of WHACKS at the thing, DENTING the metal, but doing

no serious damage. The Harvester KNOCKS the weapon out of

his hand, Marcus has no choice but to keep backing away.

MARCUS is driven to the back of the transport. Struggling

for handholds, he lowers himself out of sight, down the

framework along the side, getting out of the wind. Suddenly--

--STEEL CLAWS WRAP around him FROM BELOW, YANK him downward.

THE HARVESTER has crawled around the SIDE of the TRANSPORT,

and under the BOTTOM, in order to GRAB HIM. The hideous

machine now holds him in its clutches, hundreds of feet in

the air, its CAMERA EYES fixed on him.

THE HARVESTER produces its needle, it's coming at his face--

but MARCUS frees one hand, grabs the syringe, managing to

hold it back, inches from his skin. His strength is

weakening, but as the Harvester makes its final thrust--

--he JERKS the NEEDLE to one side and it BENDS against one of

the Harvester's own steel limbs.

Undaunted, the creature crawls up the side of the transport,

Marcus still in its clutches. It moves to the lid, which

OPENS. It lets go of Marcus to drop him inside when--

--MARCUS seizes two of its appendages and swings up onto the

harvester's back, where he--

--GRABS a couple of EYE STALKS, trying to RIP them from the

harvester's thorax, LOOSE WIRES SPARK. The Harvester twists

and thrashes, it's like he's a rodeo rider. A LIMB wraps

around him, starting to CRUSH him in a vise-like grip, when

SUDDENLY--

--CANNON FIRE RIPS through the towering HARVESTER, blowing

its thorax to PIECES, barely MISSING MARCUS.

CONTINUED: (2)

A PAIR OF A-10 WARTHOGS-- the same colorful ground attack

aircraft we saw in the first battle-- ROAR PAST on either

side of the transport.

THE CRIPPLED HARVESTER topples off the side of the transport,

still clutching MARCUS and--

--CATCHES on an ENGINE POD, the creature and Marcus both

suspended in the air. THE HARVESTER ROASTS in the ENGINE

BLAST, its CPU finally dies. Marcus is suspended below the

engine, the steel limb RELEASES HIM, he has to cling to it

now, to keep from falling.

The HUNTER-KILLERS peel out in pursuit of the two Resistance

planes.

A DOGFIGHT ensues between the much larger, more heavily

armored H-Ks, and the smaller, more maneuverable WARTHOGS.

CANNON FIRE CATCHES an H-K but has no effect. The H-Ks' BLUE

PLASMA PULSES barely miss the planes, which loop and bank.

An AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE STREAKS from a WARTHOG and BLASTS the

ENGINE of an H-K. AN EXPLOSION, the thing starts flying

erratically, heading downward and--

--CRASHING to earth in a glorious FIREBALL.

EXT.   AERIAL & RIVER - DAY

The planes are nearing a RIVER, bordered by sickly TREES. On

the far banks, even from above, we see ominous MILITARY

FORTIFICATIONS-- CONCRETE BUNKERS, ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS, etc.

MARCUS meanwhile, is trying to climb up the dead Harvester,

avoid the ENGINE BLAST and find a handhold on the transport.

THE A-10 that shot down the H-K comes around for another pass

at the transport, but--

--ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS at the far side of the river let out a

VOLLEY of BLUE PLASMA-FIRE. The BURSTS arc toward the A-10,

which swerves and climbs, but--

--PLASMA FIRE destroys a wing, the A-10 SPINS out of control.

THE OTHER A-10 breaks off its dogfight with its H-K and

speeds away from the river.

CONTINUED:

MARCUS is tantalizingly close to the upper lip of the

transport, he reaches out and--

--THE FRIED HARVESTER suddenly dislodges from the ENGINE POD,

taking Marcus with it, into FREEFALL.

WITH MARCUS, plummeting downward toward earth, a hundred feet

below, the transport continuing on its way above, crossing

the river.

MARCUS' POV - the ground and treetops getting closer. At the

last moment, his continuing forward momentum takes him OVER

THE RIVER and--

MARCUS and the DEAD HARVESTER HIT THE WATER, hard, vanishing

below the surface with enormous SPLASHES.

The surviving H-K and the TRANSPORT continue across the river

into Skynet territory, vanishing in the distance.

CAMERA MOVES to FIND a PARACHUTE, drifting earthward on the

unfortified side of the river.

EXT.   RIVERBANK - DUSK

HOLD ON LAPPING WATER for a beat.      Then--

--MARCUS breaks the surface, staggering toward shore, he

drops to his knees in the shallows.

WAKES APPEAR behind him. Hearing the water stir, Marcus

turns to see numerous DARK SHAPES moving rapidly in on him,

from different directions, FLASHES OF METAL visible beneath

the surface. These are HYDROBOTS-- AQUATIC TERMINATORS-- but

we don't get a good look at them (yet) and Marcus isn't

sticking around. He scrambles for the riverbank and makes

his way into the leafless trees.

EXT.   TREES - EVENING

MARCUS moves past the trunks of bare trees, pauses, looks

over the water in the direction the transport took.

CONTINUED:

BLAIR WILLIAMS, the helmeted pilot who ejected, hangs from

the tangled remains of her parachute, caught in the trees

about fifteen feet in the air above Marcus.

MARCUS moves closer.    Blair struggles to saw through her

lines with a KNIFE.

The LINES suddenly SNAP, Blair FALLS from the tree.

Marcus' reflexes are fast as ever, he's beneath her in an

instant and CATCHES HER. He holds her in his arms:

He does so. Blair pulls off her helmet, her hair is short.

She's in her 20s, pretty, petite but strong, a no-nonsense,

battle-hardened member of the Resistance. She pulls a

COMPASS from her flight suit, consults it briefly as she

orients herself.

Blair is already moving, Marcus hesitates, then points across

the water.

CONTINUED: (2)

She shakes her head, gestures toward the river.

Marcus absorbs this, starts walking with her.

She puts a hand out, listening.   She signals for him to lay

low, behind a fallen tree.

NEARBY-- a pair of T-1s on patrol rumble into view. They

pause, scanning the area, chain-guns at the ready. They

start to move toward BLAIR and MARCUS' hiding place.

BLAIR quickly grabs a STONE and, staying down, hurls it as

far away as she can--

CONTINUED: (3)

THE STONE strikes a few BRANCHES--

THE T-1s suddenly turn in that direction, GUNS BLAZING--

THE WOODS in the immediate vicinity are torn to pieces by the

GUNFIRE, small FIRES erupt from the incendiary bullets-- it's

definitely overkill.

THE T-1s roll over to inspect the damage, out of view.

BLAIR whispers:

She and Marcus move away quickly, away from the trees.    When

they're a safe distance from the robots--

Blair SLUGS him hard, in the arm.     He doesn't flinch, but he

looks surprised.

MARCUS shakes his head.   They keep walking.

EXT.   MUTANT FOREST - NIGHT

THE MOON over a scrubby forest, trees just a few feet high.

BLAIR and MARCUS seem like giants as they move among them.

They've been talking a while, Blair's absorbing something.

CONTINUED:

She's looking him over as she says this, it almost sounds

flirtatious. Marcus changes the subject.

BLAIR pauses, checking a small GEIGER COUNTER she carries--

it CLICKS a bit.

CONTINUED: (2)

They start moving again.   Marcus pauses, listens:

Now they both hear an eerie HOWL, changing in pitch-- like a

coyote on crack. More than one picks up the CHORUS.

She pulls a SIDEARM, holds it at the ready as she starts

running, away from the direction of the noise. Marcus keeps

up at her side, looking behind them.

WITH THE DOGS

We don't get a good look at them, but there's a pack of large

BEASTS moving quickly through the undergrowth, gaining on the

fleeing humans.

BLAIR sees they won't outrun them. She spins, FIRES in the

direction of the approaching PACK. Suddenly it's quiet-- the

animals fan out, forming a circle around Blair and Marcus.

QUICK SHOTS of MUTANT EYES, glowing in the dark-- ENLARGED

TEETH-- DARK, MASSIVE FORMS moving through the brush.

After a few tense beats, from the foliage--

A SKINDOG leaps at BLAIR from behind-- it's hideous, the size

of a Great Dane, hairless, with veiny, wrinkled skin and

long, catlike CLAWS. Before Blair can react, MARCUS leaps

between her and the dog, grabs the slavering creature by the

throat. It SNAPS its ELONGATED TEETH at him, but he manages

to BREAK its neck and hurl it toward--

TWO MORE SKINDOGS moving in for an attack.

CONTINUED: (3)

BLAIR FIRES a few SHOTS at the encroaching pack, we hear a

few YELPS--

MARCUS protects her, effortlessly tosses a few more SKINDOGS

aside, ignoring vicious bites and scratches.

The other SKINDOGS turn on dead and injured pack members,

begin TEARING INTO THEM. There's an opening now, the two

humans make a run for it.

BLAIR catches her breath, looking him over, seriously

impressed by his strength and calm.

MARCUS shrugs, turns back to see the feeding frenzy.

EXT.   NORMAL FOREST - NIGHT

It's darker now, the moon is down. MARCUS and BLAIR move

gingerly-- she TRIPS, he catches her before she falls.

BLAIR sighs, yawns, sits against a tree.

MARCUS nods, sits a few feet away from her.

MARCUS slides toward her, she nestles against him.

CONTINUED:

Soon they're kissing passionately.      But MARCUS pulls away,

rolls onto his back.

She's slipped a hand inside his pocket for warmth... now she

pulls out the SCRAPS of paper, with women's faces. She

squints at these in the dark.

MARCUS speaks carefully, unsure how to articulate this.

CONTINUED: (2)

She closes her eyes, settling against him, her head against

his chest. Marcus stares up into the darkness.

INT.   TRANSPORT - NIGHT

DARKNESS. We just make out KYLE and STAR among the other

PRISONERS, most of whom are awake now in the steel container.

Star still wears her baseball cap. The prisoners are JOSTLED

as the transport touches down.

EXT.   LOADING ZONE - NIGHT

The TRANSPORT has landed amongst numerous CONTAINERS, CRANES

and VEHICLES-- all is dimly lit, enveloped in a vague reddish

HAZE. THE FLYING FRAMEWORK and ARMATURE detach from the

TRANSPORT, and TAKE OFF into the air again-- leaving the

trailer-like wheeled CONTAINER. Something resembling the CAB

of a semi-truck backs into position, latching onto attachment

points on the container.

INT.   TRANSPORT - NIGHT

--A SMALL PANEL SLIDES OPEN   at the front of the transport,

and a half-dozen PROCESSING   AEROSTATS buzz inside from the

cab. These are larger than    the spy drones, with attached

PINCERS that can encircle a   person's arm.

PRISONERS duck, try to dodge these things. But they quickly

buzz from captive to captive, latching onto their arms-- we

hear SCREAMS, see FLASHES OF LIGHT from the aerostats.

KYLE tries to bat away an AEROSTAT, but its PINCERS latch

onto his forearm. A SIZZLING SOUND-- Kyle CRIES OUT with the

pain, a flash of RED LIGHT-- then the aerostat DETACHES and

moves to its next victim.

STAR gets the same treatment from a different AEROSTAT.   She

moves to Kyle's side, tears in her eyes, sucking on her

burned wrist to ease the pain.

CONTINUED:

KYLE looks grimly down at--

--a fresh BAR CODE seared into his arm.

EXT.   LOADING ZONE/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

THE CAB and CONTAINER, now resembling a semi, pulls out of

the loading area. Digitally controlled, it needs no

headlights as it rolls in the near-darkness.

OVERHEAD ANGLE as the vehicle moves onto a cloverleaf access

ramp leading to a HIGH SPEED SUNKEN HIGHWAY, a river of fast-

moving TRAFFIC heading in both directions-- unlit vehicles

moving close together at 120 mph through the reddish gloom.

EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - DAWN

CLOSE - BLAIR and MARCUS's feet trudge through low brush,

step over undergrowth. CAMERA MOVES to find a STRAND OF

BARBED WIRE, emerging from the dirt a few feet away.

MARCUS pauses, almost having stepped on a WATERMELON.

BLAIR stops walking, alarmed, a few feet away from him.

MARCUS looks around them, points.

CONTINUED:

A few yards away, STRINGS OF BARBED WIRE... CAMERA MOVES to

reveal it's behind as well as ahead of them. They've come

through a gap where the wire had fallen.

INT.   OUTPOST/BARRACKS & COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY

DARK. We hear BABIES CRYING from nearby, FUMBLING in the

dark, muttered CURSES-- then a MATCH lights a CANDLE.

BARNES, 20-ish, good-looking and cocky, yawns and sneers,

annoyed at being awakened. TWO WOMEN share his mattress.

MORRISON is bearded, long-haired, bleary-eyed, a middle-aged

man in charge here. He sits up in bed, also beside A COUPLE

OF WOMEN. This place has become an underground crash pad,

communal living for about a dozen people-- Morrison and

Barnes the only men, four or five WOMEN and quite a few

CHILDREN of varying age.

BARNES grunts, yanks the blanket off his bedmates, who CRY

OUT in protest. He wraps it around himself, carries the

candle as he steps around other SLEEPING FIGURES, makes his

way toward a METAL STAIRCASE winding downward. Moments

later, we hear a GAS ENGINE start up-- LIGHTS flicker on.

The place is pretty grimy and run-down, but it was once a

military environment. There's a BANK OF TV MONITORS against

one wall, which COME TO LIFE. A couple of the WOMEN move

toward the adjacent NURSERY AREA to tend to the babies-- one

of them, LISA, moves to the TV MONITORS. She squints at one.

CONTINUED:

ON A SCREEN

MARCUS and BLAIR in the exact positions we last saw them,

looking exhausted. They CRY OUT, unheard.

EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - DAY

BARNES pokes his head up from a concealed TRAPDOOR thirty

yards from BLAIR and MARCUS, who are hoarse from shouting.

BARNES consults a MAP, turning it to orient himself.

BLAIR and MARCUS obey, moving cautiously.

CONTINUED:

They do as told.

They slowly pace five steps.      On the fifth one, there's a

CLICK beneath Marcus' foot--

A horrified moment of eye contact between him and Blair-- she

DIVES TO THE GROUND, away from him as--

BOOM!   MARCUS is thrown through the air by the EXPLOSION--

MARCUS' BODY lands a few feet from the trap door.

INT.    OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - DAY

Frantic action-- the unconscious MARCUS is carried down a

corridor from the open trap door by BARNES, MORRISON and a

couple of women, NANCY and LISA. BLAIR, bleeding from

shrapnel injuries, assists. She yells at BARNES:

INT.    OUTPOST/INFIRMARY - DAY

MARCUS is deposited gingerly on a METAL TABLE in this crude

MEDICAL AREA. Numerous INFANTS and TODDLERS about.

JANE, a doctor, moves toward MARCUS with scissors and other

medical tools, cuts away a tattered pants leg, the shreds of

his sneaker. She stops and stares, palpates a BLACKENED LEG

briefly. She looks up in alarm.

CONTINUED:

She takes a scalpel, pulls it across the CHARRED, HEAT-

DEFORMED SKIN. It doesn't even leave an incision.

JANE opens Marcus' shrapnel-torn shirt, takes the scalpel and

gingerly pulls it across the flesh of his chest. No effect.

JANE looks at MORRISON, backing away from Marcus.

MEMORY MONTAGE: QUICK SHOTS-- altered, impressionistic, as

before. SFX of STATIC, high-pitched, complex DIGITAL NOISE.

--a detached, fleshless metal framework for a ROBOTIC HAND is

suspended by wires-- it FLEXES, forming a FIST.

--CAMERA CIRCLES a muscular MALE TORSO, without arms, legs or

head. METALLIC ATTACHMENT POINTS await these missing parts.

--the inside of MARCUS' FACE, a thin membrane of artificial

skin with eye, nose and mouth holes, is lowered through an

AQUEOUS environment TOWARD CAMERA.

THROUGH AN EYEHOLE we see SERENA, face distorted by the

LIQUID. She looks worried. We hear her MUFFLED VOICE:

INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - DAY

START TIGHT ON MARCUS as he opens his eyes, a beam of bright

SUNLIGHT in his face. CAMERA PULLS BACK and ROTATES to

reveal that he is suspended UPSIDE-DOWN from a winch by a two-

inch thick STEEL CABLE.

MARCUS thrashes, trying to free himself, then looks up and

sees that--

--the CABLES are strung through HEAVY STEEL BOLTS which have

been DRILLED THROUGH HIS CALVES, locking them together. His

FOREARMS have been immobilized in the same grotesque fashion.

From above, the BEAM OF SUNLIGHT shines through the narrow

crack between an enormous pair of SLIDING STEEL PANELS.

MARCUS twists his neck to look downward--

MARCUS' POV-- a circular pit below, the dark bottom invisible

to him-- he's hanging near the top of an empty MISSILE SILO,

its ICBM launched years ago.

At one edge of the silo pit, near scaffolding and tool carts,

SMALL CHILDREN have gathered to stare. Also there is BARNES--

he leans back, eyes closed, in a folding chair, with an RPG

in his lap. One of the KIDS taps Barnes' leg and he jerks

upright. He immediately trains his weapon on MARCUS, clearly

nervous now that the terminator is conscious.

MARCUS stares at Barnes, deadpan, for a beat.

INT.   OUTPOST/BARRACKS & COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY

CLOSE ON X-RAYs of MARCUS' TORSO and LIMBS-- clearly

mechanical gears, steel plating, hydraulics, etc.

CONTINUED:

WIDER, JANE holds up an X-ray of his SKULL, which shows

almost nothing.

MATTRESSES have been piled to one side, we now see framed,

cracked and yellowing POSTERS of MILITARY EQUIPMENT-- AIR

FORCE JETS, ATLAS ROCKETS, etc. These are interspersed with

crude CHILDREN'S DRAWINGS on the walls.

BLAIR sits at a battered dining table, surrounded by angry

outpost RESIDENTS, including JANE and MORRISON.

At the communications area by the TVs, LISA wears a HEADSET,

speaking into a SHORTWAVE RADIO. She calls to the others:

NANCY, an overwrought older WOMAN, gets in Blair's face,

pointing at the X-rays.

A KID runs into the room.

CONTINUED: (2)

INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - DAY

BLAIR is first to reach the edge of the silo, horrified at

the sight of the dangling MARCUS. BARNES keeps the RPG

trained on him, they shout over each other.

MORRISON and the OTHERS join them, eyes fixed on Marcus.

Morrison puts a hand on her arm.

CONTINUED:

During the above, other KIDS and ADULTS IN BG AD LIB-- "Kill

it," "Goddamn robot," etc.-- increasing mob anger, until--

His impassioned CRY silences the onlookers.       He speaks more

quietly, desperately:

CONTINUED: (2)

His CRY ECHOES through the silo. The CHILDREN cower behind

the adults. BLAIR is genuinely moved by his plight.

BARNES hefts the RPG, looks toward MORRISON-- "should I?"

Morrison seems torn, about to give the order--

LISA rushes in from the communications area, breathless,

amazed by her own news:

They all seem astonished-- this has gone right to the top.

INT.   OUTPOST/COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY

MARCUS sits impatiently in a wooden chair, facing a VIDEO

CAMERA and a MICROPHONE. BARNES trains an RPG at his head

while MORRISON finishes PADLOCKING HEAVY CHAINS to the BOLTS

in Marcus' arms and legs-- these attach to a nearby STEEL

POST. BLAIR stands nearby. LISA fumbles nervously with the

TRANSMITTER, plugging in wires.

CONTINUED:

LISA makes a connection, we hear CONNOR'S VOICE, the same one

we heard on the car radio.

INT.   COMMAND CENTER/CONFERENCE AREA - DAY

MARCUS' FACE pops to life on a VIDEO MONITOR. We're in a

Spartan, windowless space, it feels like it's underground.

JOHN CONNOR leans INTO FRAME, studies the screen. He wears a

dark sweater, nothing like a uniform. Connor is 40ish now,

but looks older, prematurely grey, years of war have taken a

toll. There's an ever-present sadness in his eyes.

INT.   OUTPOST/COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY

MARCUS listens to the disembodied VOICE, unimpressed.    The

OTHERS almost stand at attention.

CONTINUED:

MARCUS rolls his eyes, makes an angry FACE at the CAMERA.

Marcus takes this in for a sober moment.

This earns outraged glares from the others, but Blair stifles

a smile. Barnes moves to strike him, Morrison stops him.

CONTINUED: (2)

The CONNECTION goes dead.

INT.   COMMAND CENTER/CONFERENCE AREA - DAY

Densely marked MAPS on a CONFERENCE TABLE. CONNOR is now

flanked by a couple of SENIOR ADVISORS, older military men--

along with KATE BREWSTER, late 30s, now his wife-- and

visibly PREGNANT. She's poring over FAXES of the X-RAY

IMAGES. (Like Connor, all military personnel here favor

casual dress, at most pins or patches to indicate rank.)

CONNOR picks up the FAXES, disturbed by them.

CONTINUED:

THE ADVISORS nod, pick up their papers and exit. As soon as

they're gone, Connor sits wearily in a chair, tosses the X-

rays and papers onto the table, his authoritative mask

slipping. Kate touches his arm. He leans his head against

her pregnant belly.

He BANGS HIS FIST on the table atop the PAPERS.

INT.   OUTPOST/CORRIDOR & LAUNCH TUBE - DAY

MARCUS is marched down the corridor to the launch tube,

Frankenstein-like, MORRISON holding the chains, keeping a

safe distance from him, while BARNES keeps the RPG trained at

Marcus' head.

CONTINUED:

Marcus shuffles awkwardly, the bolts hampering his ankles.

It's reminiscent of his death walk at film's opening.

They reach the edge of the SILO PIT-- a long drop, smooth

walls, a long METAL LADDER leading down into darkness.

MARCUS pauses by the ladder, holds up his bolted arms

questioningly-- "now what?"

At a look from Morrison, he and Barnes BODY-CHECK MARCUS at

once, sending him flying over the edge--

MARCUS FALLS the thirty feet or so, strikes the concrete

FLOOR of the launch tube with a sickening THUD, the CHAINS

clattering down around him.

MARCUS is stunned, barely conscious as the LADDER is PULLED

UPWARD. It's like the bottom of a well, twenty feet in

diameter, sheer concrete walls, the floor BLACKENED from a

rocket blast.

ANGLE UP - his captors look down at him for a moment, then

move out of view.

INT.   TRANSPORT - NIGHT

CAMERA MOVES past the PRISONERS, a couple dozen total... An

HISPANIC COUPLE huddle against one wall, whispering to each

other IN SPANISH... COW rocks in despair, head in her hands,

BULL and PIG mutter to each other nearby... an OLDER WOMAN

prays, going through rosary beads... FIND STAR and KYLE.

She's watching as KYLE uses his pocket knife to CARVE an

image in the wall of the transport. He looks up.

CONTINUED:

The BACK PANEL rolls upward. CONTROL ROBOTS-- reminiscent of

the treaded T-1s but without the heavy weaponry-- flank a

path from the rear of the transport towards BRIGHT LIGHT up a

RAMP a short distance away.

THE PRISONERS instinctively move away from the robots, moving

to the front of the container... until ZZZAP! BLUE ENERGY

crackles across the floor. THE PRISONERS CRY OUT in pain at

the electrified surface, and dash toward the opening at the

rear, leaping out of the container.

LOW ANGLE, as the prisoners run by, we hold a moment on

Kyle's graffiti-- it's the STICK FIGURE IMAGES of KYLE and

STAR we saw before, they both hold hands with a LARGER STICK

FIGURE who stands between them, meant to be MARCUS.

INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT

THE CONTAINER has stopped in a large subterranean space.

There are numerous FUTURISTIC VEHICLES here-- hydrogen CARS,

three-wheeled ATVs, electric BUSES. CONTROL `BOTS closest to

the container start to close in on the huddling PRISONERS.

A ROBOT BUMPS into BULL, sending another JOLT OF ELECTRICITY

through his body, like a cattle prod. Everyone gets the

picture, starts hurrying down the line, the ROBOTS closing

around them.

COW looks around nervously, clearly freaking out.   Spotting a

gap between the robots, she bolts--

--a ROBOT SWIVELS and CUTS HER DOWN with an ENERGY BLAST.

She lies still, SMOKE rising from her body.

The other PRISONERS pick up the pace.

The LIGHT emanates from FROSTED WINDOWS at the top of the

RAMP, through which we make out the SILHOUETTES of human

figures.

CONTINUED:

GLASS DOORS part ahead of the prisoners-- a stark white,

sterile environment beyond. THE ROBOTS stop here. THE

PRISONERS disappear inside... and the DOORS CLOSE.

INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT

BARNES remains on guard duty with the RPG, propped up on some

cushions, a LANTERN by his side-- it's pretty late, the

generator's shut down. He's reading an old, yellowed COMIC

BOOK, he has a small stack at his side.

MARCUS' VOICE echoes up from below, startling him.

BARNES returns to his reading. He reacts to FOOTSTEPS from

the long corridor into the living area behind him.

BLAIR approaches with a FLASHLIGHT, her manner conciliatory.

She pulls a crumpled plastic PACKAGE out of a pocket of her

flight suit-- ancient Hostess snack cakes. BARNES' eyes

light up as he puts the RPG aside and grabs it.

CONTINUED:

BARNES tears open the package hungrily, takes a bite.       He

grins, but as he chews, his expression darkens.

From another pocket, she produces a plastic water bottle

filled with a murky gray liquid.

So saying, he takes the bottle, unscrews the cap and takes a

long pull. It's powerful hootch, he gasps for air, passes

her the bottle as she sits beside him. She doesn't drink.

He pulls her close to him for a kiss. After a moment, she

pulls away and moves to the corridor entrance. There's a

large SLIDING STEEL DOOR here.

CONTINUED: (2)

With some effort, she pulls the door CLOSED. BARNES rises

with a grin, undoing his shirt, coming close to her. He's

already unsteady on his feet.

He puts his arms around her for a full body embrace--

His words are slurring. He slides to the floor, slowly

losing his grip. He rolls onto his back with a drugged-out

expression of bliss on his unconscious face.

IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT

MARCUS leans against the wall in the dark, rolls out of the

way as the LADDER drops. BLAIR descends quickly, the

FLASHLIGHT in her belt, a battery BLADE SAW in one hand. She

sets the flashlight on the ground and moves to his side--

He does, she fires up the SAW, moves it carefully to the bolt

joining his forearms. SPARKS fly from the BUZZING BLADE as

it digs into the metal-- it's going to take some time.

CONTINUED: (3)

THE BUZZING SAW BLADE sound-bridges to:

EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

THE WHIR OF CHOPPER BLADES. A SPOTLIGHT shines over the low

growth in the minefield as a BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER circles,

coming in for a landing. WEAPONS RACKS are jury-rigged

beside the spotlight, the chopper bristles with AUTOMATED

CANNONS, MISSILES and NAPALM TANKS.

THE SPOTLIGHT picks out the CONCRETE and STEEL CAP of the

LAUNCH TUBE.

INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT

THE SAW finishes cutting the BOLT between Marcus' legs; his

arms are already free. The BUZZING cuts out, but now they

hear the CHOPPER LANDING directly overhead.

MARCUS slides the BOLTS out of his legs, freeing himself from

the chains.

CONTINUED:

BLAIR studies him a moment, no changing his mind. But she

admires him. She starts up the ladder, MARCUS following.

BARNES is still passed out as BLAIR and MARCUS ascend to the

platform around the pit. They move to the sliding door--

BLAIR starts to open it, but sees a LIGHT and hears VOICES

and FOOTSTEPS at the far end, SLIDES IT SHUT again.

MARCUS points to a LARGE VENTILATION FAN behind STEEL

GRATING, eight feet above them, on the far side of the pit.

It's not running, but there's no way to get through it.

MARCUS is already picking up the RPG-- but he points it

backwards, has no idea how to shoot it--

BLAIR grins, grabs the RPG from him-- then braces herself,

takes aim and FIRES--

KABOOM!   The EXPLOSION rips OPEN the GRATE, destroys the FAN.

INT.   OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - NIGHT

MORRISON escorts a pair of powerful UNIFORMED SOLDIERS armed

with HIGH-TECH RIFLES with explosive shells-- they react to

the EXPLOSION beyond the closed door-- and break into a run,

the soldiers readying their weapons.

INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT

MARCUS and BLAIR have moved around the narrow walkway to the

far end of the pit, beneath the SMOKING HOLE. Blair thinks

of something, pulls a small DEVICE from her flight suit, the

size of a pack of cigarettes, holds it toward Marcus.

She indicates a button.     MARCUS takes the device--

--then grabs her, KISSES HER hard on the mouth-- she's

startled-- it felt very human.

MARCUS grabs the sharp, still smoking STEEL projecting from

the hole and pulls himself upward as--

THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN and the SOLDIERS open FIRE at MARCUS--

BLAIR hits the deck as EXPLOSIVE SHELLS tear HOLES in the

CONCRETE--

--SHRAPNEL hits MARCUS in the back, he's thrown into the

ventilation shaft--

INT.   VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT

MARCUS has a CHUNK OF REBAR lodged in his left SHOULDER, but

he doesn't even notice this yet. He picks himself up and

moves quickly in the darkness, crouching in this cramped

tube. There's a TURN up ahead, he just makes it as--

An EXPLOSIVE SHELL rockets through the shaft behind him--

CONTINUED:

BOOM! THE BLAST TEARS through the metal tube, DIRT POURS IN,

blocking the tunnel from his pursuers.

EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

Near the edge of the clearing, a low STEEL VENT with a peaked

CAP. DENTS appear in it from within--

MARCUS finally PUNCHES his way out, pulls himself up and

rolls onto the dirt-- for a moment he seems safe, laying low

in the grass. Then--

--he registers the REBAR in his shoulder. It goes right

through him, emerging from his chest. Marcus is stunned.

With some effort, he YANKS OUT the REBAR and tosses it aside.

TORN METAL of his steel endoskeleton is now exposed, along

with a glimpse of circuitry. Marcus reels, puts a hand over

the hole in his chest where a heart should be; he really

isn't human. He doesn't have much time to deal with this as--

--THE CHOPPER emerges from behind the treeline, the SPOTLIGHT

picks him out and AUTOMATIC FIRE erupts--

MARCUS runs a few yards and throws himself to the ground as--

GUNFIRE STRAFES around and ahead of him-- setting off several

MINES which send up clouds of dirt.

MARCUS picks himself up and runs for the trees, leaping over

the barbed wire.

EXT.   FOREST - NIGHT

MORE GUNFIRE rips apart the trees around Marcus as he sprints

and weaves, making his way toward the river. The SPOTLIGHT

picks him up and loses him again-- it's tough for the chopper

to get a clear shot at him here.

EXT.   RIVERBANK - NIGHT

MARCUS has reached the edge of the trees, he can see the

river just beyond. He starts to move for it, when--

--FWOOM! The forest around him ERUPTS INTO FLAME, the

chopper has laid NAPALM along the river's edge.

CONTINUED:

MARCUS reels from the intense heat, bats out FLAMES on his

clothes, but his skin remains undamaged. Realizing he can

keep on moving--

--MARCUS DASHES through the dense FIRE to--

EXT.   RIVER - DAWN

--the RIVER, where the sky is just starting to LIGHTEN.

MARCUS SPLASHES into the shallows, extinguishing the FLAMES.

He fills his hands with water and sucks it down gratefully.

ANGLE ON THE WATER - A GLIMMER of METAL below the surface,

heading for the source of the splashing. Suddenly--

--the BLACKHAWK CHOPPER drops down directly in front of

Marcus, hovering a few feet above the water, the GUNNER

pointing his weapon directly at Marcus (he's one of the two

soldiers we saw before). The BLADE WASH swirls the water in

a whirlpool and beats back the FIRE behind Marcus. As the

GUNNER OPENS FIRE--

--MARCUS DIVES below the surface, BULLETS ZINGING through the

murky water.

UNDERWATER - MARCUS is winged by a couple of shots, his

thermoplastic flesh getting torn apart--

WITH THE GUNNER - He pauses a moment, squinting into the

WATER for a glimpse of Marcus, but failing to register that--

--BELOW THE CHOPPER, right beneath him, the WATER ROILS as if

teeming with piranha. Suddenly--

--HYDROBOTS ERUPT from the RIVER with a hideous BUZZING

SOUND. Hydrobots resemble segmented serpents, eyeless, but

with razor-sharp heads that DRILL into their victims-- they

respond to sound and vibrations. About a dozen of these four-

foot long, glistening steel snakes shoot from the water to

attack the chopper.

INSIDE THE CHOPPER - HYDROBOTS PIERCE the aluminum FLOOR, and

shoot into the cabin, the PILOT and the two SOLDIERS CRY OUT.

The GUNNER tumbles out of the chopper and FALLS in the water.

THE PILOT attempts to maintain control, but the hydraulics

are damaged and the steel serpents thrash about in the cabin.

CONTINUED:

THE GUNNER surfaces, trying frantically to swim to shore.

But the hydrobots are upon him, he SHRIEKS and disappears

beneath the bubbling surface, which now boils with BLOOD.

IN THE CHOPPER - A WHIRRING HYDROBOT penetrates the other

soldier's leg. He SCREAMS and wrenches the thing back out,

tossing it from the chopper just before--

--THE CHOPPER CRASHES INTO THE SHALLOWS.

THE PILOT leaps from the cabin and makes it to shore, where

he collapses. But the remaining, wounded SOLDIER can't get

out of the hip-deep water before the HYDROBOTS are upon him.

Suddenly, HANDS BURST from the water, grabbing the soldier.

A second later, MARCUS SURFACES, slinging the man over his

shoulder. He strides to shore, as if rescuing the man from

enemy fire, hydrobots thrashing and bubbling at his waist.

MARCUS reaches the amazed pilot, lays the wounded soldier

down beside him, then tears a whirring, writhing HYDROBOT

from the soldier's belly and WHIPS its head against a ROCK--

it SPARKS, micro-machine parts fly. The pilot and wounded

soldier stare at him, astonished.

He tosses the dead robo-snake aside, then turns and moves

back into the water, quickly vanishing below the surface.

UNDERWATER - MARCUS moves steadily across the silty river

bottom. He doesn't need air. HYDROBOTS come at him, he

swats them away as if they were mosquitoes, CRUSHING in his

hand those that linger too long. Those which make contact

with his artificial skin can't get far, turn and swim off.

EXT.   FAR RIVERBANK - DAY

MARCUS emerges, the FLAMES still visible on the other side of

the river, behind him. He doesn't look back, as he moves

into Skynet turf. This side of the river isn't wooded,

everything has a concrete, industrial feel. Marcus is a

mess, both clothing and skin are shredded and charred.

He nearly bumps into a SKELETAL STEEL TERMINATOR, which

emerges from behind a concrete wall. The terminator trains

its PLASMA RIFLE on MARCUS, scans him, RED EYES glowing...

CONTINUED:

TERMINATOR'S POV - RED FILTER, MARCUS' FORM is TARGETED.

READ-OUTS on the side, the HIGHLIGHTED WORDS "NON-ORGANIC -

DO NOT TERMINATE."

THE TERMINATOR turns from MARCUS, no longer interested,

moving off on its preprogrammed patrol.

MARCUS moves up a sloping, CONCRETE EMBANKMENT.   At the top

of the rise, he sees, spread out before him--

EXT.   SKYNET TERRITORY - DAY

--a hideous industrial sprawl, OPEN GAS FLAMES, SMOKING

FACTORIES, rumbling VEHICLES, H-Ks, TERMINATOR TROOPS on

patrol. Nothing green, a GREY HAZE hangs over the landscape.

After a moment, MARCUS shakes his head and gamely soldiers

on, moving along the edge of the elevated embankment.

EXT.   SKYNET PERIPHERY - DAY

MARCUS moves past banks of ANTI-AIRCRAFT guns and MISSILE

LAUNCHERS, interspersed with slowly rotating RADAR TRACKING

DISHES-- the first line of defense. From this fortress-like

wall he descends into the nightmarish environment beyond.

MARCUS reacts to a CAWING SOUND above, looks up to see--

--A CROW perching on an overhead WIRE.   A second later--

ZAP! A BLUE PLASMA PULSE blasts the thing to smithereens, a

few BLACK FEATHERS drift down as--

--a T-400 (same mask-like face we saw earlier) lowers its

plasma weapon and strolls on. Target practice.

MARCUS stays out of the way of the TERMINATOR LEGIONS

patrolling near the riverside.

EXT.   DEMOLITION SITE - DAY

MARCUS heads inland, past the ruins of a CHURCH-- WALLS with

the remains of stained glass WINDOWS, STATUES OF SAINTS.

Hearing RUMBLING NOISES, Marcus hurries out of the way as--

CONTINUED:

A WALL collapses, pushed down by an automated SKYNET

BULLDOZER. This gigantic, self-operated construction machine

has a swivelling CAMERA HEAD instead of a cab. Its giant

TREADS roll over the STONE STATUES, crushing them to dust.

EXT.   CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

MARCUS keeps moving into Skynet's turf. The demolition gives

way to massive CONSTRUCTION, as the robots remake the human

world in their own image.

CONSTRUCTION ROBOTS erect a low-slung STEEL FRAME structure,

automated CRANES and SUPPLY TRUCKS about. These robots are

oversized versions of the steel terminators we know, but with

multiple limbs bearing WELDING TOOLS, and TREADS instead of

legs. Marcus watches as BEAMS are quickly welded into place

by telescoping steel arms.

EXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY

MARCUS continues into the completed robot city. Skynet's

ARCHITECTURE is featureless, bland, purely practical: single-

story, windowless CONCRETE or STEEL structures with massive

open DOORWAYS to accommodate their largest machines. A RED

GLOW emanates from the interiors, the robots' preferred

lighting scheme. No sidewalks or signs, just thick GRIDS of

POWER LINES and PIPES overhead. Constant NOISE of BUZZING

POWER, RATTLING MACHINES, etc.

MARCUS steps inside one of these buildings--

INT.   TERMINATOR FACTORY - DAY

This TERMINATOR ASSEMBLY PLANT is an intricate, multi-leveled

clockwork maze of moving CONVEYORS and INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS.

ELECTRONICS and HYDRAULICS are ROBOTICALLY SOLDERED in place.

STEEL PRESSES stamp out TERMINATOR PARTS-- TORSOS, FACE

PLATES, SPINAL COLUMNS, LIMBS.

Partially-completed PARTS are moved by CONVEYOR to ASSEMBLY

STATIONS, where LIMBS and HEADS are JOINED to TORSOS,

elaborate OPERATIONS carried out by INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS, like

the ones in present-day factories.

CONTINUED:

SYNTHETIC SKIN is SPRAYED OVER a METAL ENDOSKELETON in

precise amounts, building up to create human features... this

is a T-400.

An INDUSTRIAL ROBOT ARM picks up a CPU from a DRY-ICE

CONTAINER. The CPU features the distinctive, linked

rectangles familiar from the earlier films. The arm lifts

this gingerly to a TERMINATOR SKELETON and INSERTS IT into

the STEEL SKULL, SCREWING A SEAL over the hole.

THE RED EYES flicker to life, and THE ARMATURE releases the

TERMINATOR, which moves away under its own power. It removes

a PLASMA WEAPON from a WALL RACK, moving past--

--the dumbfounded MARCUS.

THE TERMINATOR joins a dozen identical robots, who ride on a

treaded SKYNET TANK with a PLASMA CANNON and FLAMETHROWER.

There are numerous TANKS here, awaiting deployment.

EXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY

Rounding a corner on a straight, narrow street, MARCUS sees

all the ROBOTS and SMALL VEHICLES clearing into small NICHES

built into the walls on either side, as if clearing a path

for him. It takes him a moment to realize it's not him

they're responding to-- a RUMBLE BUILDS...

A convoy of GIGANTIC SKYNET TRUCKS-- a half-dozen modified

SEMIS now driven by CPUS-- bear down on MARCUS at extremely

high speed. They carry construction supplies: massive STEEL

BEAMS, CONCRETE PIPES, etc. And there's barely inches of

clearance on either side.

These things aren't slowing down. There's nowhere for Marcus

to duck out of the way. He has no choice but to RUN, as fast

as he can, the lead vehicle gaining on him rapidly.

MARCUS THROWS HIMSELF to the concrete in the middle of the

street, pressing his body flat as the LEAD TRUCK passes over

him, the wheels missing him by inches.

But he has only a moment's respite. THE NEXT TRUCK has a

lower undercarriage, a steel CROSSMEMBER catches his back--

--and DRAGS MARCUS beneath the vehicle, ripping off chunks of

flesh.

CONTINUED:

Marcus CRIES OUT, crawls ahead and clings to a forward

portion of the undercarriage, keeping himself just above the

pavement. His LEFT LEG, twisted and damaged, still drags on

the asphalt, throwing up SPARKS.

OVERHEAD ANGLE ON THE TRUCK - CAMERA PULLS BACK straight

above the MOVING VEHICLE, amidst the convoy speeding down

this sunken artery. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING UPWARD to reveal an

AERIAL VIEW of Skynet's city. Seen from above, the

rectilinear STRUCTURES, criss-crossing POWER LINES and

SPEEDING VEHICLES strongly resemble a PULSING CIRCUIT BOARD.

INT.   COMMAND CENTER/CORRIDOR - DAY

JOHN CONNOR moves grimly down a narrow, steel passageway,

FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. He reaches the MP, outside the door.

The MP looks a little surprised, but says nothing.    He undoes

the LATCH on the door and opens it for Connor.

INT.   COMMAND CENTER/INTERROGATION CELL - DAY

A bare, windowless space with only a cot, a metal chair and a

bedpan. BLAIR looks up, bleary-eyed, exhausted and scared.

CONNOR gestures for the MP to close the door behind him.

Blair's mighty impressed, in spite of the circumstances.       She

leaps to her feet, stands at attention and salutes.

CONTINUED:

CONNOR pulls up the chair, close to Blair, who sits on the

bed. His tone is careful, controlled.

Connor blinks at this, alert.

Blair picks up on his interest, but doesn't understand it.

CONTINUED: (2)

CONNOR is already on his feet, BANGING on the door-- the MP

unlatches it to let him out--

INT.   COMMAND CENTER/CORRIDOR - DAY

Partway down the hallway, CONNOR encounters KATE, who walks

with him, takes in his expression.

INT.   LABORATORY - DAY

START CLOSE on KYLE'S HAND, clutching STAR'S tightly.   We

hear them SINGING faintly, together:

WIDER, their heads, feet and chests are clamped onto SLIDING

TRAYS, a long row of these hold OTHER PRISONERS as well.

Kyle and Star must reach across a gap between the trays to

hold hands. (It's the first time we've seen her hatless.)

The trays are all poised before panel-covered SEMI-CIRCULAR

OPENINGS built into the wall, in a sterile, hospital-like

environment. Above each opening is a MONITOR SCREEN. An

ominous HUM is building.

IN AN ADJACENT OPERATING THEATER, visible through GLASS

WALLS, MEDICAL LASERS mounted on ROBOTIC ARMS work on

anesthetized patients (we needn't see the grisly details).

BEHIND STAR and KYLE, the PANELS OPEN, the trays slowly SLIDE

into the OPENINGS. SCREAMS and SOBS from other prisoners.

CONTINUED:

Kyle and Star hold hands for as long as possible, then

release their grip as their bodies enter the chambers and the

panels slide shut.

INT.   STAR'S TESTING CHAMBER - DAY

Immobilized in this small, tubular chamber, like an MRI, STAR

closes her eyes as she's bathed in BRIGHT LIGHT, LASER GRIDS

projecting over her skull. The HUMMING is LOUDER.

INT.   KYLE'S TESTING CHAMBER - DAY

The same thing is happening to Kyle.    He's no longer singing.

EXT.   SKYNET HIGHWAY - DAY

WITH MARCUS beneath the truck. He's moved to the edge of the

chassis, near a WHEEL, moving slowly, carefully. There's a

bit more clearance at the sides of the sunken highway now,

but they're still moving awfully fast.

THE WHEEL TURNS, the vehicle suddenly SLOWS to negotiate a

turn, braking downhill. Marcus seizes this opportunity.

ANOTHER ANGLE as MARCUS LAUNCHES himself from below the

vehicle, rolling into the GAP between the convoy and the

concrete wall. The remaining vehicles RUMBLE PAST, as MARCUS

presses himself against the wall.

CONTINUED:

When they're gone, he gets to his feet, limping down the

highway on foot for a short distance, dragging his damaged

leg behind him. He hears ANOTHER CONVOY approaching.

Just in time, he finds a SEAM in the poured concrete, it's

enough to give him purchase-- he struggles to climb up the

eight feet of freeway wall.

MARCUS makes it over the top, TRUCKS RUMBLING past below.

This is desolate, hilly country.

ANGLE DOWN - among the vehicles below is a CONTAINER, like

the one that held Kyle and Star. We glimpse the anguished

FACES and REACHING HANDS of CAPTIVES within.

MARCUS reacts, moves as fast as he can alongside the trucks

for a short distance until--

THE VEHICLES shoot ahead around a curve and out of sight.      In

the distance is a COMPLEX OF BUILDINGS, clearly the

destination.

Marcus begins moving along the edge of the freeway, heading

for the complex. He reaches the edge of a plateau, looks

down, his expression changing. This is the last thing he

expected to see. CAMERA MOVES to reveal--

EXT.   COASTAL VALLEY - DAY

--a panoramic view of a GORGEOUS COASTAL COMMUNITY. The

place is lush, green, with well-maintained, lovely HOMES in

the distance, a BLUE SEA beyond. The complex of buildings

stands a few miles away, at the far end of the valley.

MARCUS, amazed, limps down a gentle slope leading to this

seeming paradise.

EXT.   GOLF COURSE - DAY

MARCUS emerges from a small stand of trees and finds himself

looking at a groomed FAIRWAY. Marcus hears a NOISE nearby--

--a GOLF BALL bouncing on the ground not far away.    MARCUS

turns in the direction it came from.

CONTINUED:

An electric GOLF CART approaches, driven by a handsome,

middle-aged golfer-- JEREMY-- who wears casual country club

attire, eating from a clear BAG OF TRAIL MIX. Jeremy comes

to a stop beside Marcus.

Marcus slowly shakes his head, as Jeremy climbs out of the

cart, looking him over carefully, taking in the exposed metal

at his shoulder and leg.

JEREMY eyes him, a little surprised at his ignorance.

Marcus hesitates a beat, can he trust this guy? But Jeremy

simply seems eager to help, as he guides him to the passenger

seat, then gets behind the wheel. With a smile:

He extends a hand.     After a beat, Marcus reaches toward it--

Jeremy clutches Marcus' hand tightly.     Marcus blinks, Jeremy

cocks his head, then lets go.

CONTINUED: (2)

With that, he hits the gas.

EXT.   RESIDENTIAL STREET - EVENING

JEREMY drives the cart down the road, past well-kept homes

with generous lawns-- it's a beautiful, upscale community at

MAGIC HOUR. BICYCLISTS and FUTURISTIC CARS pass, Jeremy

waves to NEIGHBORS. Marcus takes it all in with disbelief.

He holds the plastic bag out to Marcus, who obligingly takes

a handful of trail mix, pops it in his mouth. After a beat,

he spits it back out in his hand, stares at it.

Marcus stares at him, confused. Jeremy is starting to

realize just how out of it he is, speaks as if to a child.

Marcus just stares, Jeremy gestures at the world around them.

CONTINUED:

As he speaks, he notices his BAG is nearly empty. He

casually lifts his sport shirt and CLICKS OPEN a PANEL

beneath his rib cage. We glimpse CIRCUITS, FIBER-OPTICS.

From within he removes an identical BAG FILLED with TRAIL MIX

(the stuff he just ate), and replaces it with the empty bag.

He clicks the panel shut again, pops a NUT in his mouth.

Marcus stares at this, appalled, then blinks and looks away.

He reacts to the sound of PIANO MUSIC, a difficult piece

being played expertly-- PASSING a PICTURE WINDOW, he sees a

PIANIST practicing.

In front of this home, a GARDENER and WINDOW WASHER are hard

at work. They're both T-400s, with the eerie mask-like

faces. Marcus reacts.

Jeremy winces, as if at a racial epithet. He's starting to

regret giving Marcus a lift, his manner is careful, as if

he'd picked up some homeless guy.

Marcus grabs Jeremy, who pulls back a bit, alarmed.

CONTINUED: (2)

For a moment, Jeremy's expression darkens.     Then he shuts his

eyes, and his features relax.

Jeremy nods and SMILES, looking at him once more.

EXT.   PARK - DUSK

They've left the main street now, driving down a WOODED PATH

leading to the "facility." There are lawns, fountains, etc.

Marcus SLAMS ON the brakes, then clutches Jeremy by the

throat-- the man looks more annoyed than frightened.

CONTINUED:

Marcus drags the man from the cart by his throat, squeezing

harder.

Marcus releases him, but remains in his face.       Jeremy takes a

moment to recover his composure.

He taps his own eye with an audible CLICK, not flinching.

Marcus takes a couple steps away, looking at his own hands.

Jeremy points to nearby BUILDINGS, a little peevish.

CONTINUED: (2)

So saying, he's back in the cart, pulling away in a hurry.   A

moment later, Marcus moves off amongst the trees.

Nearing the complex, Marcus reacts to BIRDSONG above.   He

looks up, stops as he sees--

--a TINY SPEAKER, concealed amongst the LEAVES.

MARCUS moves to this tree, touches it-- the bark feels

unnatural. He RAPS it with his FIST-- it sounds hollow, made

of FIBERGLAS. He fingers a LEAF, tries to bend it-- PLASTIC.

He crouches, studying the GRASS. After a moment, he finds a

SEAM in the pristine lawn. He starts to peel it up... it's

ASTROTURF. Beneath it is SANDY DIRT.

Marcus KEEPS PEELING the plastic covering back... more dirt--

and BITS OF BONE. As he continues to uncover the ground we

see recognizable CHUNKS of SKULLS, LEGBONES, etc.

By now he's rolled back a few square yards, numb with horror.

Marcus moves on toward the complex with new determination,

trying to stay out of sight.

INT.   LABORATORY - NIGHT

ON THE MONITORS above the long row of chambers-- colorful 3-D

IMAGES of the prisoner's BRAINS are being constructed, like

PET scans. DENSE DIGITAL READ-OUTS BELOW, as data is

analyzed. (Levels of seratonin, endorphins, etc.) Beside

these are BARCODES and small INSET PHOTOS taken within the

chamber, the subjects looking frightened.

IN THE OPERATING THEATER, the LASERS are still now, their

grisly work done for the moment, awaiting the next batch.

An ENGINEER, a nice-looking, well-built young man in loose

black clothing, moves down the row of chambers, studying

results. He speaks into a subtle HEAD-SET:

CONTINUED:

As he speaks, the BARCODES on the monitors in question turn

either RED or GREEN in response to his judgments.

He reaches KYLE'S CHAMBER, we see Kyle's anguished FACE on

the monitor photograph.

Kyle gets a GREEN BARCODE, the engineer is on to Star, he

strokes his chin.

On STAR'S MONITOR-- RED BARCODE.

The engineer KICKS something on the floor, bends down to pick

it up-- STAR'S BASEBALL CAP. He flings it expertly into--

--a nearby TRASH RECEPTACLE.

EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT

A series of LOW-RISE BUILDINGS, attractively LIT, surrounded

by lawn, trees and water features. A HUMAN TRANSPORT heads

down a RAMP into a parking structure; a GATE closes.

FIND MARCUS, watching this from behind some plastic foliage.

He sets his jaw, removes something from his pocket, fiddles

with it and places it carefully in the bushes. He moves on.

Nearing an entrance, he hears a familiar voice from nearby.

CONTINUED:

A BACKLIT FIGURE approaches-- as her face enters the light,

we see that it's SERENA, looking healthy, beautiful. Marcus

stares at her coldly.

SERENA takes in his anger, adopts a regretful tone.

SERENA puts her arms around him. He doesn't return the

embrace, but he doesn't resist her.

So saying, she presses a small, taser-like device at the base

of his skull-- ZAP! MARCUS SPASMS and goes limp in her arms.

SERENA lets him down gently on the ground.

A pair of T-400s now approach from the shadows. They pick up

Marcus and carry him toward the building. CAMERA MOVES to

find, hidden in the bushes where Marcus placed it--

--the ELT, the EMERGENCY BEACON Blaire gave him... activated

now, a single GREEN LIGHT PULSES.

INT.   SLEEPING CABIN - NIGHT

DARKNESS, then a KNOCK and a DOOR FLIES OPEN.

JOHN CONNOR sits up in bed.      KATE blinks beside him.

CONTINUED:

INT.   COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

CONNOR and KATE, hastily dressed, cross through the command

center we've seen before, and step through a HATCHWAY into--

INT.   SUBMARINE/BRIDGE - NIGHT

--a MASSIVE CONTROL AREA for a HUGE SUBMARINE. SONAR and

RADAR stations, a CREW of NAVAL PERSONNEL, most do not wear

uniforms. This sub is where Connor has been the whole time.

THE AIDE leads CONNOR to a GPS TRACKING TERMINAL, where NAVAL

and AIR FORCE OFFICERS hover.

The OFFICERS raise AD LIB objections ("but sir--"). CONNOR

raises a hand to silence them and moves a few steps away,

beside KATE. They speak in hushed tones:

CONTINUED:

He turns back to the OTHERS, holding their gaze.

EXT.   UNDERWATER - NIGHT

We see now that Connor's on board a NUCLEAR ATTACK SUB, with

TWO MORE SUBS moving in tandem behind it.

HOLD ON the LEAD SUB and MOVE IN ON the STENCILLED NAME as it

PASSES CAMERA: "LOS ANGELES SSN-688."

INT.   REPAIR LAB - DAY

START ON MARCUS' DAMAGED LEG. It has been DETACHED from his

body, halfway down the thigh. Elaborate CIRCUITS are

exposed, as SURGICAL MACHINES perform repairs with LASERS,

MECHANICAL ARMS replacing damaged parts.

NEARBY, MARCUS opens his eyes, coming to. He's CLAMPED onto

an elaborate, mobile SURGICAL TABLE, the stump exposed. His

body and head are secured within its framework. MORE

MACHINES swiftly repair the damage to his chest and shoulder.

MARCUS twitches, freaking out, struggling in his bonds--

THE DETACHED LEG twitches as well.

SERENA is on the other side of a GLASS PANEL, operating

computer controls. This is an automated surgical

environment, the work on Marcus carried out by various

MACHINES and MICROTOOLS-- busy HYDRAULIC ARMS, LASERS, etc.

CONTINUED:

MARCUS lets out a horrified, bitter laugh.

THE SURGICAL TABLE swivels, bringing MARCUS into alignment

with the repaired leg. In moments it's reattached, the

plastic skin thermosealed at the joint.

THE LASER TOOLS and HYDRAULIC ARMS now move on their ceiling

racks, coming close to MARCUS' FACE. The TABLE INVERTS,

exposing the back of his head.

CONTINUED: (2)

THE LASERS start cutting into the back of Marcus' head,

BURNING through the plastic SKIN. MARCUS lets out a CRY of

rage, strains at his bonds.

CLOSE as the HYDRAULIC ARM attaches to the back of Marcus'

head and removes a section of STEEL SKULL...

REVEALING THE SURFACE of a HUMAN BRAIN, gray matter enmeshed

in WIRES and CIRCUITRY beneath a clear PLASTIC CASING, in a

bath of pale reddish LIQUID. Tiny NEURAL SPARKS fire.

CLOSE as an elaborate ELECTRONIC INTERFACE MODULE is fixed at

the base of Marcus' exposed brain.

ON MARCUS' FACE - his expression of agony vanishes, his

features become peaceful.

EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT

MARCUS is dressed in fresh clothes, his damage repaired-- and

he seems more at ease than we've yet seen him. He walks

beside SERENA, who wears a small EARPIECE, a high-tech

cellphone device. They smile as they pass other HYBRIDS on

the late shift.

CONTINUED:

She clasps his hand in both of hers. MARCUS closes his eyes,

a jolt of pleasure shooting through him.

SPFX MONTAGE

FLYING POV, THROUGH BANKS OF CLOUDS, RICH COLORS in the sky,

glinting GOLDEN LIGHT--

ROCKET DOWNWARD to a PRISTINE COASTLINE, some place like

Hawaii-- PLUNGE INTO THE WATER--

RISE and come face to face with SERENA, SMILING... moving in

for a kiss... CAMERA IRISES OPEN TO WHITE...

EXT.   OFFICE PARK - NIGHT

SERENA releases Marcus' hands. He opens his eyes slowly,

reeling from the intense moment. CAMERA REVEALS a subtle

BULGE at the base of his skull, the implanted interface.

Marcus shakes his head-- far from it.       Serena laughs.

CONTINUED:

She leads him up steps into one of the buildings.

INT.   CORRIDOR - NIGHT

CAMERA TRACKS past GLASS WINDOWS, we glimpse ARTIFICIAL SKIN

growing on a steel terminator skeleton... a prototype T-800,

perhaps with a strong resemblance to Arnold.

Elsewhere ENGINEERS observe a SHIMMERING COLUMN of LIQUID

METAL, twisting and assuming different shapes within a sealed

GLASS CONTAINER.

WITH MARCUS and SERENA, moving past these observation areas.

INT.   TIME DISPLACEMENT CHAMBER - NIGHT

START on a glowing TIME SPHERE, just a vague, translucent

blue ball right now, dwarfed by the MACHINERY which sustains

it. The sphere is set into a dome-shaped depression in the

floor. There's a distinctive, loud HUM.

A PHYSICIST here at a TERMINAL.    He nods toward--

--SERENA and MARCUS as they enter.

SERENA gestures at a large DIGITAL DISPLAY of a 24-hour

CLOCK: the date, 10.16.18, 00:25, SECONDS FLASHING PAST.

CONTINUED:

They move to an exit, Marcus looking back over his shoulder

at the glowing blue sphere.

EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT

MARCUS and SERENA cross the attractive campus.

INT.   NEURAL NET CHAMBER - NIGHT

CAMERA MOVES over TUBES and FIBER-OPTIC CABLES, which run

into multiple GLASS CYLINDERS filled with translucent PINK

LIQUID. These contain HUMAN BRAINS... there are hundreds of

them hooked up in here.

SERENA has moved to a COMPUTER TERMINAL, one of a few here.

IMAGES begin to appear on the screen-- small inset PHOTOS,

each with a BARCODE. They quickly fill the screen. MARCUS

leans forward, squinting.

ON SCREEN - dozens of FACES, PHOTOS taken inside the TUBES,

mostly looking terrified.

MARCUS shakes his head.

ON SCREEN - a new SET OF FACES appears one by one on the

screen. This time, STAR and KYLE are among them, next to

each other.

MARCUS touches the screen, two fingers, one on each of the

kid's faces. THEIR IMAGES expand to fill the screen, side by

side, KYLE on the left.

CONTINUED:

KYLE'S IMAGE, the date 10.16.18... the time, 22:19:23.      The

word, in green: PROCESSED.

SERENA smiles.

Move to STAR'S IMAGE.       10.15.18... 22:20:49... and the word,

in red: TERMINATED.

Marcus takes this in, his face shows pain. Then SERENA

grasps his hand-- in moments, he's smiling.

Suddenly the building SHAKES, the sound of a distant

EXPLOSION. SERENA releases MARCUS, listens in her earpiece.

She touches him once more and moves off, leaving him alone

here. We'll hear other far off EXPLOSIONS from time to time

during the following. MARCUS stares at--

HIS FRIENDS' FACES, which slowly FADE TO BLACK, replaced by

his own REFLECTION. Seeing his own face, his smile vanishes.

MARCUS is going through a terrible internal struggle, the

interface fighting his own natural emotions. He backs away

from the machine, looks around at the brains, all the lives

destroyed.

Hurrying past the wall of brains, he moves a hand to the base

of his skull... with an ANGRY CRY--

CONTINUED: (2)

--his FINGERS dig into the plastic skin at the back of his

HEAD--

MARCUS grits his teeth, this is incredibly hard to do, but--

--he RIPS THE INTERFACE MODULE from his skull-- CONNECTIONS

SPARK, we glimpse STEEL SKULL and the encased BRAIN beneath.

MARCUS hurls the DEVICE to the floor, its elaborate CIRCUITRY

SHATTERS. He reels with momentary anguish at what he's just

given up-- then he moves out of there with determination.

EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT

FIRE and SMOKE in the distance, VEHICLES MOVING fast amidst

the destruction. It looks like the place is under attack.

MARCUS moves purposefully across the campus-- suddenly

HEADLIGHTS illuminate him. He dives out of the way as--

A FUTURISTIC ATV roars past at high speed.   It's followed

moments later by a massive SKYNET TANK.

MARCUS scrambles to his feet, continues on his way.

INT.   TIME DISPLACEMENT CHAMBER - NIGHT

THE PHYSICIST is SLAMMED against a wall. He never loses his

unperturbed expression as MARCUS manhandles him. THE CLOCK

reads 01:05.

CONTINUED:

MARCUS tosses the man aside, regards the GLOWING, CRACKLING

TIME SPHERE-- it doesn't look too inviting.

THE DOOR bursts open. SKELETAL TERMINATORS storm in,

wielding PLASMA RIFLES-- they mean business--

THE PHYSICIST finally looks alarmed, getting in front of

MARCUS as he yells--

A TERMINATOR FIRES anyway, BLOWING A HUGE HOLE through the

center of the Physicist's chest and throwing him backward to

the floor-- the man looks down and shakes his head at the

damage to his plastinated body.

A SECOND TERMINATOR spins his weapon on--

--MARCUS, who LEAPS into the center of the sphere just as THE

ROBOT FIRES and HITS nearby MACHINERY which EXPLODES--

ENERGY ERUPTS around MARCUS, the CRACKLING BLUE LIGHT of the

time sphere surrounds him. We experience this from--

--INSIDE THE SPHERE. Marcus instinctively crouches in a

FETAL POSITION. An instant later, his CLOTHING BURNS OFF HIS

FLESH. The HIGH TECH ENVIRONMENT around him TRANSFORMS into--

EXT.   PARK - DUSK

STAY WITH MARCUS-- FOLIAGE APPEARS around the SPHERE. The

BLUE ENERGY fades, leaving him naked, 20 FEET IN THE AIR--

MARCUS PLUNGES to the ground and rolls.     He looks up--

THE PLASTIC TREE has been melted with the heat like a candle,

DRIPPING down around him.

MARCUS tries to get his bearings-- he's in the park area, the

FACILITY not too far off. He moves in that direction.

EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT

THE GATE to the garage OPENS, an empty HUMAN TRANSPORT

emerges... FIND MARCUS, concealed, still unclothed. He dives

under the GATE as it rolls shut.

INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT

MARCUS moves stealthily through the space where the prisoners

were off-loaded, keeping out of sight behind parked vehicles.

He starts at the sight of--

THE CONTROL ROBOTS, hooked to CHARGING POSTS along one wall.

MARCUS makes his way to the GLASS DOORS.   Using all his

strength, he manages to PRY THEM OPEN.

INT.   LABORATORY - NIGHT

The ENGINEER as we saw him before, consulting the MONITORS

above the CHAMBERS.

The engineer picks up STAR'S BASEBALL CAP and flings it into

the TRASH...

Just then he hears SHATTERING GLASS behind him.   He spins--

MARCUS trains a ripped-off ROBOTIC LASER ARM at him like a

weapon. The arm trails heavy CABLES and CIRCUITS, linking it

to the operating theater we saw earlier. (These also

artfully conceal Marcus' nakedness.)

MARCUS takes a step closer.

CONTINUED:

THE ENGINEER moves to a RED ALARM BUTTON on a COMMUNICATION

PANEL mounted in the wall, extending a hand--

MARCUS connects two wires to FIRE UP the LASER and--

A RED BEAM neatly SEVERS the ENGINEER'S HAND at his WRIST.

THE ENGINEER studies the metal STUMP of his severed hand with

a blank expression.

The ENGINEER smirks and WHACKS the ALARM BUTTON with his

other hand. An ELECTRONIC KLAXON sounds.

MARCUS FIRES OFF THE LASER again--

--THE ENGINEER stares at him-- we see a flaming STRIP in the

wall behind his head. He takes a step toward Marcus and--

--his HEAD TUMBLES OFF, bounces on the ground, and rolls to

MARCUS' FEET. (There's no blood, just laser-severed

electronic connections).

MARCUS picks up the ENGINEER'S HEAD by the hair.   The man's

brain is unharmed.

THE MAN'S MOUTH twists and grimaces, making ELECTRONIC STATIC

from the FRIED VOICEBOX. MARCUS is taken by surprise when--

--THE DECAPITATED BODY lunges at him, knocks the LASER from

his grasp. After a brief STRUGGLE, MARCUS spins the

engineer's HEAD to face his body. He grabs the INTERFACE at

the base of his neck.

THE ENGINEER'S FACE suddenly shows fear-- his body FREEZES.

CONTINUED: (2)

AT A CONTROL TERMINAL, the one-handed, headless BODY taps

keys and controls. MARCUS holds the Engineer's HEAD so that

he can see over his own shoulder. Moments later--

--the MACHINE HUM winds down. THE MONITORS flash the word

"ABORT," the PANELS begin to OPEN.

MARCUS addresses the HEAD in his hand.

THE HEADLESS BODY begins to unbutton its shirt.

MOMENTS LATER - CLOSE as KYLE'S TRAY slides out of his

CHAMBER. The RESTRAINTS retract automatically. He sits up,

looking toward--

--STAR, on the next tray.   She hasn't moved, her eyes closed.

He climbs off his tray, takes her in his arms.    She starts

awake.

Around them, the dozen OTHER PRISONERS are getting to their

feet, surprised at their sudden freedom.

MARCUS approaches KYLE, buttoning his new shirt.

The two kids hurry to him, Marcus hands Star her BASEBALL

CAP, rescued from the trash. As she puts it on:

THE PRISONERS are already on the move, frantically dashing

out of the lab ahead of our heros.

CONTINUED: (3)

He leads the kids out the way he came, passing...

THE ENGINEER, in underwear, sitting in a corner, cradling his

head in his lap. His remaining hand strokes his interface,

his eyes closed in a blissful expression.

INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT

THE PRISONERS smash the GLASS DOORS off their hinges, and

charge past--

THE CONTROL ROBOTS, which are now coming to life. ELECTRIC

BURSTS drop a couple of slow-moving ESCAPEES as they dash

into the garage and make for--

--ANY AVAILABLE VEHICLE. Former PRISONERS hijack BUSES,

HYDROGEN CARS. Pure chaos, it feels like a prison riot.

MARCUS, STAR and KYLE weave amidst the robots and humans.

KYLE and STAR take cover behind a concrete post just as--

--PLASMA BURSTS explode around them.

SKELETAL TERMINATORS armed with PLASMA RIFLES are pouring in

through the OPENING GARAGE GATE.

A STOLEN BUS heads for the exit, KNOCKING a couple of

TERMINATORS aside and SMASHING through the rising GATE,

clearing a path for others to follow.

A SKELETAL TERMINATOR sets its sights on a MOVING HYDROGEN

CAR, which follows the bus--

TERMINATOR POV - RED FILTER, HIGHLIGHTING BULL, the DRIVER.

"TARGET ACQUIRED - TERMINATE."

THE TERMINATOR SHOOTS HIS RIFLE through the car's windshield--

it EXPLODES, close to KYLE and STAR, the building SHAKES.

CONTINUED:

KYLE and STAR flee the flames, THE TERMINATOR'S HEAD swivels

quickly, taking them in. It starts to pursue, but MARCUS

gets in front of it. Before it can fire--

The Terminator pauses, looks him over.

TERMINATOR POV - MARCUS is quickly scanned, comes up "NON-

ORGANIC - DO NOT TERMINATE."

THE   TERMINATOR starts to move past Marcus, who LEAPS on it

and   WRENCHES THE RIFLE from its grasp. As the robot spins on

him   he BLOWS ITS HEAD OFF, then looks around frantically for

the   kids. A moment later--

--KYLE ROARS up at the controls of a futuristic ATV, STAR

clinging to him.

No time to argue, MARCUS leaps into the back beside STAR and

KYLE GUNS IT out of there, careening off walls and other

vehicles, he's still not much of a driver. MARCUS meanwhile

PICKS OFF potential threats with the PLASMA RIFLE.

EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT

KYLE has to swerve to avoid the stolen BUS, which is now on

its side, IN FLAMES. It was taken out by--

--an automated SKYNET TANK, one of THREE TANKS here. They're

positioned to take out escaping vehicles. But the ATV is a

small, maneuverable target, swerving and speeding crazily. A

TANK FIRES and MISSES, the BLAST taking out a chunk of wall.

KYLE WHOOPS, heading across the campus--

--ONE TANK pursues, it moves surprisingly fast, capable of

flattening anything in its path. MARCUS FIRES at it, but the

PLASMA RIFLE BLASTS don't have much effect on the ARMOR.

THE TANK FIRES again, but--

CONTINUED:

--KYLE ROARS around a corner, just in time.   However, in so

doing, he nearly runs over--

--MARCUS, from earlier, on his way to the time sphere,

visible in the HEADLIGHTS for only an instant before he LEAPS

OUT OF THE WAY.

KYLE, focused on the pursuing tank, didn't even see this.

But STAR did. She looks wide-eyed at MARCUS beside her.

PLAY THE CHASE, as the TANK pursues the ATV through the

facility.

KYLE takes his vehicle through a large FOUNTAIN, which the

TANK SMASHES to bits.

KYLE OVERSTEERS, putting them up on two wheels, then

recovers, narrowly avoiding--

--PLASMA BLASTS, which obliterate the FACADE of a building.

SKELETAL TERMINATORS appear in their HEADLIGHTS, weapons

raised.

MARCUS stands and FIRES over KYLE'S HEAD, BLOWING them out of

the way.

NEAR THE PARK, MARCUS points.

EXT.   PARK/WOODS - NIGHT

THE TANK is gaining on them, KYLE steers around a GAZEBO, the

tank SMASHES right through it, turning it to splinters.

CONTINUED:

Kyle steers toward THE WOODS, dodging between the thick

TREES. Too many obstacles for the TANK here, it SCREECHES TO

A HALT and lets off a JET OF FLAME.

THE TREES behind the ATV all IGNITE, turning to acrid pools

of MELTING PLASTIC. KYLE barely stays ahead of the FIRE.

THE TANK backs up and takes a new route, around the woods.

IN THE WOODS, KYLE strikes a GLANCING BLOW against a tree

trunk, and the ATV TOPPLES on its side, spilling its

passengers. After a beat, they rise, shaken.

MARCUS rights the vehicle, taking the wheel, the kids climb

in back.

EXT.   RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

THE ATV comes rocketing down the main street, MARCUS driving

now. Suddenly, directly in front of them--

--THE TANK APPEARS, moving swiftly around a corner, GUN

TURRET SWIVELING at them.

AS IT FIRES, MARCUS SWERVES onto a LAWN and--

--CRASHES THROUGH a PICTURE WINDOW.

INT.   LUXURY HOME - NIGHT

A handsome HYBRID COUPLE, in pajamas in front of a BIG SCREEN

TV. They turn and react as the ATV skitters through the room

and down a hallway. The ATV is followed a moment later by--

--THE TANK, which TAKES OUT THE ENTIRE WALL, BARRELLING

through the living room and BURYING the HYBRIDS in RUBBLE.

CONTINUED:

MARCUS takes the ATV UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.

THE TANK keeps SMASHING through the house, as its TURRET

SWIVELS upward and BLASTS AWAY.

UPSTAIRS - THE PLASMA BLAST COMES THROUGH the FLOOR, just

missing the ATV as it rockets through a MASTER BEDROOM,

toward a BALCONY.

DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK tears through an upscale RECREATION

ROOM, splintering a POOL TABLE, smashing through PINBALL

MACHINES.

UPSTAIRS - MARCUS takes the ATV straight out onto the

BALCONY, THROUGH THE RAILING and INTO THE AIR.

DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK BLASTS THROUGH a KITCHEN and BATHROOM

on its way out the other side of the house.

EXT.   LUXURY HOME/BACK YARD - NIGHT

THE ATV JUST CLEARS an enormous SWIMMING POOL, landing hard

on the far deck and moving on, fast.

THE TANK SMASHES THROUGH THE BACK WALL and--

--TAKES A NOSEDIVE into the pool, out of commission.

INT.   LUXURY HOME - NIGHT

THE RUBBLE in the living room shifts and the HYBRID COUPLE

extract themselves, taking in their destroyed home with

placid expressions.

EXT.   RESIDENTIAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT

A moment's breather. Marcus slows the vehicle, which WOBBLES

and SMOKES from all it's been through. He looks around.

CONTINUED:

He points toward the COAST, we see a MARINA in the distance,

a BOAT moored at a DOCK.

MARCUS steers the ATV down a slope toward the shoreline.

EXT.   COASTLINE/DOCK - NIGHT/DAWN

MARCUS, KYLE and STAR leap off the ATV and sprint for a

MOTORBOAT. Kyle carries the rifle now.

As they near the boat, MARCUS reacts to the sight of--

--RED EYES FLICKERING in the darkness at the END OF THE DOCK,

the BLUE GLOW of a RIFLE CHARGING.

MARCUS leaps in front of KYLE and STAR shielding them with

his BODY. The PLASMA BLAST envelops him, MARCUS is blown--

--INTO THE WATER. KYLE and STAR are flattened by the force

of the blast, lie motionless on the dock. Their PLASMA RIFLE

lies a few feet away.

THE SKELETAL TERMINATOR who shot Marcus moves swiftly down

the dock, its PLASMA RIFLE trained on the water now. It

moves past Kyle and Star, who remain motionless on the

ground, and goes to the edge of the dock--

--BLAM! STAR snatches up their own PLASMA WEAPON, and BLASTS

the thing in the back, knocking it INTO THE WATER, which is

only a few feet deep here. As it rises, SHE FIRES again,

taking the Terminator's head off. It goes under.

THE SKY is beginning to LIGHTEN now as, a moment later,

MARCUS EMERGES. As he climbs from the shallow water back

onto the dock, Kyle and Star stare at him with astonishment.

Seeing their expressions, he checks himself for damage--

there's METAL exposed at his shoulder, arm and hand, his FACE

partially TORN AWAY, ONE EYE MISSING. He tries to speak, but

can only manage an ELECTRONIC CROAK.

Kyle and Star back away from him.

Marcus shakes his head, starts to move toward them.   STAR

raises the rifle, points it at him.

CONTINUED:

They hear a WHISTLING SOUND from shore, hit the deck as--

--a MISSILE BLAST TAKES OUT THE BOAT and a large chunk of

DOCK.

Laying low, they look up to see--

--a small army of TANKS and TERMINATORS approaching... even a

HUNTER-KILLER moving in from the horizon, swinging its

SPOTLIGHT in all directions. It looks like the last stand.

MARCUS turns back to KYLE and STAR.   His voice is a distorted

WHISPER.

Star puts the rifle aside, with an apologetic expression.

She moves to Marcus, gingerly touches his exposed metal--

then hugs him tightly.

Kyle, more stoical, looks out to sea.   His expression

changes, becomes almost hopeful as--

--IN THE DISTANCE, a HUGE, BLACK SHAPE rises to the surface

of the water, just visible against the dawn horizon.

FIREWORKS! MISSILES blast the H-K... NAPALM erupts around

the TANKS and TERMINATOR ARMY as--

--A SQUAD OF A-10s SCREAM IN from over the land, FIRING

CANNONS, launching AIR-TO GROUND MISSILES to take out the

TANKS. ONE A-10 flies low overhead and WAGS ITS WINGS.

INT.   A-10 COCKPIT - DAWN

BLAIR at the controls, helmeted with her face exposed, lets

out a VICTORY WHOOP as she looks out her canopy at the

huddled humans below.

EXT.   COASTLINE - DAY

KYLE points to the dark shape on the water-- now visible as a

huge SUBMARINE with the RISING SUN behind it.

CONTINUED:

HIGH ANGLE as ZODIAC BOATS reach land. HAZ-MAT SUITED

SOLDIERS leap out and run to our heroes at what remains of

the dock, others head inland to provide covering FIRE.

MARCUS addresses a TEAM LEADER, who's taken aback at his

frightening appearance and distorted voice:

As MARCUS gives the man a few more directions--

--ONE HAZ-MAT FIGURE, standing a few feet off, studies Kyle

and approaches.

The figure pulls off a glove and unzips his mask, extends a

hand. It's JOHN CONNOR.

KYLE is amazed to be meeting the man face-to-face. He shakes

hands, wide-eyed and speechless. It's a strange moment for

Connor, too, for different reasons.

CONNOR turns away from his first meeting with his father to

be, a bit dizzy at the experience. He addresses Marcus.

MARCUS smiles as best he can, given his ruined face.

WIDER, as CONNOR replaces his mask, moves to direct his

troops. MARCUS, KYLE and STAR stay close together.

INT.   SUBMARINE/HATCH AREA - DAY

Near the ENGINE ROOM, a couple dozen RESCUED PRISONERS are

being treated by unarmed MEDICAL PERSONNEL, others huddle

under blankets with food and drink. KATE is among those

helping the former prisoners.

KYLE and STAR eat ravenously, he finishes one MRE and grabs

up another. A few feet away, MARCUS leans against a wall,

plasma RIFLE at his side. A DOCTOR examines him warily,

prodding his injured face.

The doctor moves on as a couple of HAZ-MAT SUITED FIGURES

come down the ladder from the hatch, FACE-MASKS removed.

Among them is CONNOR. KATE moves to his side as more dazed

HUMANS come down. She speaks quietly, eying KYLE nearby.

Connor can't deal with that at the moment, speaks loudly.

He trails off, reacting to the sight of--

A FAMILIAR FIGURE descending the ladder, in a long coat, head

down. She looks up to make eye contact... SERENA.

SLO-MO:   seeing Marcus, Serena reaches into her coat--

CONTINUED:

MARCUS moves at the same time, to grab his PLASMA RIFLE--

SERENA leaps off the ladder, aiming a small, powerful PLASMA

WEAPON.

SERENA fires first--

BLAM! THE PLASMA BLAST catches MARCUS in the shoulder and

BLOWS his GUN ARM clean off. His PLASMA RIFLE discharges,

BLOWING a HOLE in the side of the sub, near the floor-- WATER

gushes in like a FIREHOSE.

LEAVE SLO-MO. Spun around by the force of the blast, MARCUS

lands on his back, SPARKS and SEVERED CABLES protruding from

his damaged shoulder. An ALARM KLAXON SOUNDS.

PRISONERS and DOCTORS SCREAM and scramble for cover--

CONNOR steps in front of KATE to shield her, they back away

through the WATER BLAST, CONNOR FIRING at SERENA--

SERENA takes numerous HITS from the EXPLOSIVE BULLETS, which

take off PIECES of her, but she keeps coming, FIRES again--

--HITTING CONNOR in the lower abdomen. He's thrown backward,

KATE cries out and throws herself on top of him. His gun has

gone flying.

SERENA turns her attention to MARCUS, standing over him,

plasma weapon aimed point-blank at his head.

MARCUS manages a smile as he shakes his head.

BLAM! MULTIPLE PLASMA BLASTS from behind RIDDLE SERENA'S

TORSO, the BLUE PULSES burning right through her-- her HEAD

takes a hit, the STEEL is RUPTURED.

THE PLASMA WEAPON flies out of her arms, she COLLAPSES.

TIGHT ON HER FACE, as she turns to see who got her--

There's no one there.    But ON THE FLOOR lies--

CONTINUED: (2)

--MARCUS' SEVERED ARM, still holding his PLASMA RIFLE.     The

hand RELEASES the weapon.

SERENA'S HEAD tilts, her eyes go blank-- she's dead.

MEDICAL PERSONNEL are doing what they can to help CONNOR,

blood at his lips, KATE and KYLE at his side.

UNDERWATER - DAY

THE SUBMARINE "LOS ANGELES" moves TOWARD CAMERA as it slowly

SINKS deeper beneath the water's surface. We see a makeshift

STEEL PATCH welded near the hatch.

INT.   SUBMARINE/CORRIDOR - DAY

MARCUS waits outside the entrance to the SICKBAY. He's

cleaned up a bit, wears fresh clothes (one sleeve pinned up).

He seems weary, wrung out, his systems damaged. He'll move

stiffly through the following scene, like a stroke victim.

STAR sits beside him, a hand on his arm.   BLAIR approaches

from down the corridor.

MARCUS nods, keeps his head bowed.

His voice is still WEAK.

CONTINUED:

Star gingerly reaches up to touch the torn plastic at the

back of Marcus' head, where the interface was.

He turns to her, exposing his mangled face, one eye gone.

BLAIR takes this in, fishes in a pocket.

She holds out a PAIR OF SUNGLASSES.     MARCUS, a bit amused,

slips them on.

THE DOOR opens nearby and an ashen-faced KATE emerges.

BLAIR gives MARCUS a farewell hug.

INT.   SUBMARINE SICKBAY - DAY

CONNOR has a PRIVATE MEDICAL AREA set aside. He's not

looking good-- pale, weak, only semi-conscious. I.V.s and

MONITORS, other LIFE-SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. KYLE is with Connor,

staring at a small POLAROID PHOTO in his hand. CONNOR can

barely speak above a whisper.

KYLE starts to hand the photo back, CONNOR waves it away.

KYLE is a bit puzzled, but obediently keeps the snapshot.

KATE enters with MARCUS, touches the boy's shoulder.

KYLE reluctantly leaves, still looking at the photo, with a

nod to MARCUS on the way out. He joins STAR in the doorway,

they go off together.

KATE, CONNOR and MARCUS are alone now. Throughout scene,

Kate fights to maintain a steely control-- but she's clearly

not far from tears.

She pulls some MEDICAL DIAGRAMS out of a drawer, lays them

before Marcus. He examines--

--a SCANNED IMAGE of his FACE, various elements HIGHLIGHTED.

CONTINUED:

MARCUS moves to the NEXT IMAGE-- it shows his features

TRANSFORMED into another's-- something closer to JOHN

CONNOR'S FACE, with a JAGGED SCAR over part of his features.

Marcus lowers the papers, absorbing this.

Connor can barely speak above a whisper:

Connor gestures for Marcus to move closer, he speaks with

great effort:

Kate leans toward Marcus, who's lost in thought.

CONTINUED: (2)

MARCUS bows his head for a long beat, as if seeking an answer

from within. Then he looks up again with resolve.

He lifts his hand-- the SKIN TATTERED, METAL exposed at

finger joints-- and moves to take CONNOR'S TREMBLING HAND.

EXT.   MOUNTAIN WAR - NIGHT

SLOW-MOTION, MOS - a SNOWY, MOUNTAINOUS ENVIRONMENT...

STEEL TERMINATORS go down in HAILS OF BULLETS.   We hear

Marcus' VO, his voice strong and assured:

AN ARMY of HUMAN RESISTANCE FIGHTERS marches through the

SNOW, GUNS BLAZING.

AN H-K goes down IN FLAMES, SMASHES in the MOUNTAINSIDE.

THE GOLDEN EXPLOSION silhouettes a single FIGURE, who stands

on a PROMONTORY, surveying the battle below. AIDES and

SOLDIERS surround him, but he towers over them, giving

orders, in complete control. MOVE IN SLOWLY on him.

ANOTHER BLAST illuminates his face for an instant-- scarred,

craggy, a blend of Marcus and Connor-- but fierce, determined

and proud. [Perhaps shoot this with both actors.]

CONTINUED:

THE LIGHT FADES, shadowing him in darkness again and we...
