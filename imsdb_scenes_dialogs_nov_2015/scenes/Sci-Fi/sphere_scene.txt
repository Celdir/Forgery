EXT.  STREET IN GEORGETOWN -- MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Fog hangs above the street, amongst the streetlamps.  Apartment

buildings line the curb, it is very quiet.  In one building, six floors

up, a bedroom light is on.  WE SEE the silhouette of Norman's WIFE

looking out the window.

A tinted-window black SEDAN travels down the street, pulls up in front

of the apartment building.  A U.S.  NAVY decal is on the door.

THE LOUD, HARD CHOPPING OF A HELICOPTER PROPELLER

EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY

Blinding sunlight, as the helicopter WHIPS by, speeding above the

Pacific Ocean.

INT.  HELICOPTER -- DAY

Norman, 53, disheveled, unshaven, sits in the back.  He studies a

pamphlet in his hand: "AIRCRASH SURVIVAL: HOW TO COPE".  The PILOT, in

the cockpit, turns to him.

Norman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag.

The pilot glances back at him again.

Norman looks out the window and sees a group of ships circling in the

water.

EXT.  SHIP DECK -- DAY

The helicopter descends down onto the helipad, wind gusting about.  A

young, female OFFICER -- holding her hat to her head -- rushes to

greet Norman, as he climbs out of the helicopter.

She looks down crudely at his shotty, nylon dufflebag.

She lugs it over her shoulder, no problem.

Norman follows the officer away from the helipad.

INT.  SHIP

She leads Norman down a flight of stairs.

As they march down a hallway, Norman looks down at his wrinkled suit,

tries to smooth it out.

She staightens up, like she might have said too much.

INT.  BARNES' OFFICE

CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES, 60s, immaculate, proud of who he is, talks on

the phone.

EXT.  BARNES' OFFICE

Norman stands in front of the door.  The doorplate reads: PROJECT

COMMANDER -- CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES.  Norman straightens his big-knotted

tie.  Deep breath.

INT.  BARNES' OFFICE

As the door opens, Barnes is putting down the phone, rises from his

desk, as Norman steps inside.

They shake hands.

Barnes looks at Norman, sizing him up.  An akward silence.

Norman tries to laugh as Barnes ushers him to the door...

INT.  HALLWAY

Barnes leads Norman down the corridor, lined with OFFICERS and GUARDS.

A GUARD unlocks a large, steel door.

Norman looks at the guard as they proceed through the doorway,

wondering how the guard knows his name.

The steel door shuts loudly behind them.

Another GUARD opens up another large steel door...

INT.  TECH ROOM

Barnes leads Norman through the room, crammed with video monitors,

screens, and grids.  Officers talk into radios.  Technicians work on

computers.

Norman tries to keep pace...

ANGLE ON a large VIDEO SCREEN -- shows a diver walking on the ocean

floor, holding a bright artificial flashlight.

ON THE VIDEO SCREEN -- the diver shines his light on a large, metallic

OBJECT.

Barnes walks toward a TECHNICIAN, sitting at a keyboard.

ANGLE ON THE MONITOR as an IMAGE OF THE CRAFT begins to form.

A beat.

ANGLE ON THE MONITOR -- showing a grid depicting an image of the craft

and a small layer of ROCK above it.

INT.  STAIRWELL

Barnes and Norman shuffle down the stairs.

As they head down a hallway, Barnes pulls the ULF REPORT out from

under his arm, hands it to Norman.

Norman looks at it, almost embarrassed to be holding it.

INT.  BRIEFING ROOM

ON A VIDEO SCREEN -- sonar video of the spacecraft.

The team members sit around the conference table:

TED FIELDING, 41, geologist, boyish and happy to be here.  BETH

HALPERIN, 36, biochemist, mother of three who's never worn an apron.

ARTHUR LEVINE, 54, marine biologist, pudgy and quiet.  HARRY ADAMS, 32,

mathamatician, African-American, wire-glasses, no bullshit.

ON NORMAN, watching the team...

A LOUD MECHANICAL WHIRR

INT.  TESTING ROOM -- LATER

A large, X-Ray APPARATUS moves to the side, revealing Norman's FACE.

ON BETH -- standing next to him.

Norman sits up...

ANGLE ON TWO NAVY CORPSMEN, standing behind glass in the next room,

monitoring Beth and Norman.

EXT.  SHIP -- LATE AT NIGHT

THE SKY -- clouds looming on the horizon.

ANGLE ON ARTHUR LEVINE, leaning against the railing, looking out at

the water.

ON NORMAN, approaching him.  Arthur never looks at Norman, he just

stares out at the water.

ANGLE ON THE WATER, an ocean of seemingly endless, choppy waves.

CLOSE ON NORMAN, lying on a cot.  It is dark.  His eyes are open.  He

stares at the ceiling.

INT.  DESCENT PLATFORM

A porthole hatch to the DESCENT SUB unlatches loudly.  A SUB-OFFICER

help Norman lower himself through the hatch.

INT.  DESCENT SUB

Norman steps down the ladder into the sub compartment.  Seated in a

circle area: Ted, Beth, Harry, and Arthur.  Ahead of them, Captain

Barnes sits with the pilot in the sub's cockpit, separated by a wall

of plexiglass.

Norman takes a seat between Beth and Ted.

Across from Norman, Harry is WHISPERING something quietly into

Arthur's ear.

Arthur's face drips with sweat, as Harry continues to whisper into his

ear.

Norman watches Arthur, dripping with sweat.

Red interior lights flicker on in the compartment, and WE HEAR the sub

make a HISSING sound.  The sub lurches, and begins to lower in the

water.

Harry has gotten to Arthur.  Arthur is on the verge of panic.

Harry continues to whisper in his ear.

Arthur leaps violently out of his seat, scrambles to the plexiglass

wall.

Arthur bangs on the plexiglass wall with his fists.

Arthur VOMITS, violently, heaving, splattering the plexiglass wall.

The sub LURCHES again, coming to a stop.  The compartment is totally

silent, as they begin ascending to the surface.

ON HARRY smiling a sly, evil grin directed right at Norman.

The sub lurches again, and WE HEAR clanking metal.  The hatch door

opens.

And Arthur, wiping the vomit from his mouth, climbs up the ladder and

out the hatch door.

Silence.

The hatch door LOCKS, loudly.  The sub lurches, and begins descending.

Harry is still staring at Norman...

Norman looks over at Beth.

ON NORMAN, saying nothing.

EXT.  OCEAN

WE SEE the sub descending into darker waters.

EXT.  DH-8 HABITAT -- ARRIVING DOCK

The SUB descends into the AIRLOCK, metal clanks against metal.  Around

it, the DH-8: interwoven cylinders lit up with lights.

INT.  AIRLOCK -- PRESSURIZING ROOM

CLOSE ON THE HATCH DOOR closing tightly, locking.

A SOFT WHIRR.

ANGLE ON -- Barnes and the four remaining team members standing in the

small, claustrophobic pressurizing room.  Like sardines.  Nobody says

anything.  A long beat.

THE DOOR

in front of them, opens.  TEENY FLETCHER, 30s, a big-boned female

officer, stands before them.  She wears a black plastic PAD, a

"talker", around her neck.

She hands each member their own "talker".  Norman takes his.

INT.  DH-8 HALLWAY

Fletcher leads Barnes and the team members down the hallway.  Each of

them wears the "talkers" around their necks.

Fletcher listens through her radio earpiece, turns to Barnes...

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

CLOSE ON A MONITOR -- showing the robot in front of the curved gray

metal of the spacecraft.

JANE EDMUNDS, 32, the unit archivist, works the control panel.  Another

MONITOR clicks on -- showing the robot's POV of the door.

ON THE MONITOR -- THE ROBOT CAMERA scans the spacecraft hull, stops on

a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door.

ON THE MONITOR -- a robotic CLAW extends out to the panel.  Trying to

pry the panel open.

The claw is clumsy, and keeps banging into the metal.

ON THE MONITOR -- another robotic arm extends out, with a rubber

sucker.  It pushes against the panel, but doesn't suck.

Barnes straightens up, looks at Ted...

ON THE MONITOR -- the spacecraft, sitting there silently, staring back

at them.

Norman, quiet in the corner, perks up...

All eyes on Norman.

A beat as they all stare at him.

INT.  CHANGING ROOM

ANGLE ON A LOCKER door opening.  Inside is an elaborate JUMPSUIT and

HELMET with the name: "JOHNSON", stenciled above the faceplate.

The other team members take their suits out of their lockers.

Norman holds his jumpsuit out and away from him, like it's something

nuclear.

They all look over at him.

INT.  AIRLOCK ROOM -- (A CYLINDER)

Dressed in jumpsuits and helmets -- Barnes jumps into a POOL of ocean

water, cut out from the floor, leading to the ocean.  It looks like a

tiny swimming pool.  Ted jumps in next.  Beth, Harry, and Norman are

left...

She hops in.  Norman watches, looks up at Harry, next to him.

Harry nudges him forward.

Harry pushes him again.  Norman catches himself.

Harry pushes him again.

And Harry just pushes him in.  Norman slips and falls awkwardly... into

the ocean depths.

BLACK.

Quiet.  Only THE SOUND OF NORMAN -- BREATHING.

For a couple beats.

Now... NORMAN'S POV -- from inside his helmet -- a light SHINES from

behind him -- casting his SHADOW onto the murky ocean floor.

Norman's head turns, and he's BLINDED by a light -- it's Harry, the

light SHINING from the top of Harry's helmet.

WE HEAR Harry's voice, static, through Norman's helmet.

ON NORMAN -- his GLOVE -- fumbling at his waist.

HIS HELMET LIGHT -- FLICKERS on.

ON NORMAN -- slowly, beginning to walk on the ocean floor.

HIS FEET -- squashing gently, lightly into the muddy ground.

NORMAN'S POV -- can barely make out the others in front of him, their

helmet lights STROBING the dark water, crossing each other, like

searchlights on a foggy night.

CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE -- eyes cold, BREATHING.  Couple beats.  And

HEARS:

Norman's eyes look up... WE PULL BACK...

LONG, HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the team -- their little helmet lights tiny

and insignificant almost as...

IN FRONT OF THEM -- the SPACECRAFT.  Dwarfing them in size, looming

large, majestic, like nothing we've ever seen.  The enormous tail fin,

in the distance, extends high out of the coral.

In the huge MOUND OF CORAL covering the spacecraft, WE SEE a tunnel --

cut out like a cave -- lined with tiny, dim lightbulbs.

INT.  TUNNEL

About 60 feet deep.  Narrower than they'd like.  Norman descends,

clumsily, awkwardly -- pushing off the bulky, iron handles fastened to

the coral walls.

THE LOUD HISSING OF AIR

INT.  SPACECRAFT AIRLOCK

CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE as he watches the water recede, down past his

faceplate.

THE LOUD BANGING OF METAL

Ted has wedged a crowbar into the door and BANGS at it with a

sledgehammer.

They all back away, cramming into the far corner of the airlock as Ted

keeps swinging.

Ted stops and looks at the door.

Norman takes the hammer.  Walks up to the wedge.  Gets his bearings.

Rears back... then stops.

Something has caught Norman's eye.  He looks down at the wedge.

Barnes comes toward him.  The others follow.  Barnes bends down, looks

closely down at the wedge in the door.

ON BETH -- she touches the door with her palms, feels around.

THE DOOR STARTS TO RUMBLE

Barnes unstraps a GUN -- nearly the size of an uzzi -- from his

buckle.

The RUMBLING louder...

THE DOOR begins to slide open.

Beth backs away.

THE DOOR, sliding, is revealing COMPLETE BLACKNESS inside.  The door

stops, it's open, it's quiet.  They all stand there, looking at

BLACKNESS.  A long beat.

INT.  SPACECRAFT

ON NORMAN -- cautiously stepping inside.  His helmet light SHINES on the

others ahead of him, walking along a 5 foot wide CATWALK, suspended

high in the air.

Metallic BEAMS and RAFTERS criss-cross above them.

Norman looks over the railing -- his light STROBES through 40 feet of

darkness, dimly lighting the LOWER HULL, a dense network of STRUTS and

GIRDERS.

Ted SPOTLIGHTS the OUTER HULL.

Beth's light SHINES down onto the CATWALK.  WE SEE FOOTPRINTS outlined

on the dusty floor.

ON THE FOOTPRINTS -- large, like the boots they're wearing.

LONG SHOT -- seeing them suspended high in the air on the catwalk,

walking.  Their tiny streams of LIGHT moving about.  WE SEE just how

ominous this spacecraft really is.

They approach a DOOR, at the end of the catwalk.

She presses a button near the door.  The door SLIDES open.

Barnes holds out his gun, and enters.  The others behind him.

ON BARNES -- leading them through a small hall.  It seems to be opening

up into some sort of room -- when Barnes stops.  Dead in his tracks.

ON NORMAN -- as he steps around Barnes, his light BRIGHTENING on: A

SIGN that reads: "Trash."

Very softly, Harry begins to laugh.

Norman looks up and SEES more of the room as his light SHINES

throughout it: TABLES, COUCHES and CHAIRS -- made of leather, very

comfortable looking.

They begin to slowly wander about...

Beth touches the table, it's metal, but it's soft and rubbery.

ON NORMAN -- glancing up at Harry...

A quiet moment as they take this in.

INT.  SPACECRAFT -- DEEPER INSIDE

Ted and Barnes trek through a vast cargo bay, like two ants wlth

flashlights.

BACK IN -- THE ROOM

Norman, Harry, and Beth...

ON NORMAN -- as he sits down in one of the CHAIRS.

They LISTEN to a GIRGLING NOISE.

SUDDENLY -- the chair Norman's in -- wraps around him, squeezing him

inside, padding sliding around his head, his shoulders enveloping him

-- sucking him inside...

Beth bends down, presses a button, the CHAIR releases Norman...

ON BETH's FACEPLATE -- as she's looking down -- WE BEGIN TO SEE --

reflected in her faceplate: yellow digital lettering sputtering

across...

"RV-LHOOQ... DCOM1... "

Her EYES look up slowly... as we

THE BLACK SCREEN in front of the chairs, lit up with bright yellow

lettering:

"RV -- LHOOQ -- DCOMl -- U.S.S STAR VOYAGER"

"ASSIMILATING DATABASE" as a series of numbers race upwards in

count...

And the desk in front of them LIGHTS UP, a control panel coming to

life.

ON THE SCREEN as it changes, now filled with columns:

SHIP SYSTEMS

DATA SYSTEMS

QUARTER MASTER

FLIGHT RECORDS

Harry punches some keys on the control panel.

ON THE SCREEN as it changes:

FLIGHT DATA SUMMARIES

FDS 01/01/47-12/31/49

FDS 01/01/50-12/31/52

FDS 01/01/56-12/31/56

FDS 01/01/56-02/01/56

FDS 02/02/56-UNKNOWN ENTRY EVENT

Harry pauses, looks down, and punches more keys...

ON THE SCREEN -- as it expands in size, widens around them, curving...

WE SEE a galaxy of stars, planets coming OFF THE SCREEN, into the

room, becoming three dimensional, suspended in air, giving the

illusion of depth.

The IMAGE begins streaking outward, TOWARD US, moving rapidly, like

we're flying through it.

The stars and other space matter streaking by.

Harry stares, walking around the desk, moving into the 3-D image...

The CLUSTER of stars grows brighter and brighter, as it comes closer

and closer, brightening.

The FIELD twists and turns as the SCREEN and FIELD become BLINDING as

WE ENTER the cluster, the black hole.

ON NORMAN -- his face, bright, FRIGHTENED as he HEARS:

STILL ON NORMAN -- frightened...

INT.  CARGO BAY

ANGLE ON our six team members' BOOTS, in the distance.  AS WE PAN UP

and AROUND WE SEE a curved surface appear: a surface of slowly

swirling green and blue fluids.  Like mercury.  Mesmerizlng.

AS WE COME AROUND, the team stands looking at the SPHERE, 30 feet in

dlameter, held by a GIANT CLAW gripping it from the top.

They walk around it, circling it, looking up at it.

ANGLE ON THE SPHERE -- some dark red MARKINGS on it's surface...

ON THE RED GROOVES -- engraved into the surface.

INT.  HABITAT -- HALLWAY

DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR -- WE SEE Barnes, through a half-closed door,

pacing, talking on the phone...

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

Edmunds, Barnes, and the team members (minus Ted) look at the monitor.

ON THE MONITOR -- Ted pushing on the SPHERE door.  Banging into it with

his shoulder.

CLOSE ON PRINTER, TYPING: "Surface winds at 25 knots -- Estimated Time

of Departure -- 01:45 hrs"

INT.  DH-8 HALLWAY

Empty, sterile.  WE HEAR the repeating sound: THWAP.  Almost like a

dripping faucet.  THWAP... THWAP...

INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

Harry on his bunk, staring at the wall, flicking his middle finger at

his cheek: THWAP... THWAP.

Norman is lying in his own bunk, below Harry.

Harry leans his head over his bunk.

Norman gets out of his bed.

Norman pacing.

Norman stops pacing, a beat.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

CLOSE ON MONITOR: Video of the sphere.  RAPIDLY rewinding.

PLAYBACK: WE SEE the sphere -- idle.  Nothing around it.  Then it's DOOR

slowly OPENS, revealing BLACKNESS inside.  A beat.  And then it closes.

Edmunds plays it again.  This time...

WE MOVE IN ON HARRY, staring at the monitor.

ON HARRY -- those cold, intelligent eyes.

CLOSE ON PRINTER, TYPING: "... 30 knots -- ETD -- 00:19 min"

INT.  HALLWAY

CLOSE ON -- Norman and Barnes.

INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

Barnes on the phone with the surface.  Ted talking to him anyway...

INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

ON NORMAN -- gathering his things.  Stuffing his shotty dufflebag.

Beth, at her bunk, doing the same.

Norman stands up.  Looks at the bunk above him: unpacked clothes,

unpacked belongings, a notebook lying there saying: PROPERTY OF DR.

HARRY ADAMS.

ON NORMAN -- panicking, looking around for Harry.

BACK IN -- COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

Barnes out the door, Ted at his heels...

ON NORMAN -- running at them...

Norman runs off.  Barnes storms down the hall...

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

Edmunds working the monitors, stops.  Seeing something on a screen.

Staring in horror...

INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

Barnes, phone to his ear...

Barnes turns...

ON HIS MONITOR -- Harry, in jumpsuit and helmet, stands in front of the

SPHERE.

Barnes quickly puts on his headset mic...

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

Edmunds, Norman, Beth, Ted staring at the monitor...

Through the speakers...

ON THE MONITOR -- Harry, before the SPHERE...

The sphere DOOR slowly opens.

Harry steps up and into the sphere.  The door closes slowly behind him.

PRINTER, TYPING: "... ETD -- 00:15 min"

Norman running across a catwalk...

PRINTER, TYPING: "... ETD -- 00:05 min EVACUATION IMMINENT"

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

ON THE MONITOR -- the sphere door, slowly opening.  Revealing:

BLACKNESS.

A still moment and then Harry tumbles out the sphere, and falls to the

ground.

INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

Barnes, squinting at Harry on his monitor.

Harry lies motionless.

ON BETH -- in the hall, hearing that.

INT.  SPACECRAFT

Norman, running, blindly, through a hall, around corners...

Barnes' voice goes static, and cuts out.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

ON THE MONITOR -- flickering, losing power...

ON THE MONITOR -- flickering, fading, and all the lights and monitors

SHUT DOWN.

INT.  SPACECRAFT

ON HARRY -- lying still, face down under the sphere.  Goes to him.

Checks Harry's LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.  Still blinking -- he's still alive.

Norman, pauses, looks up, staring at...

THE SPHERE

Mesmerizing.  He can see himself, reflected in the swirling mass,

staring back at himself.  The door begins to open, closes.  Begins to

open.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Dark.  Ted, Beth, and Barnes wander throughout.

The lights flicker back on.

THE OCEAN FLOOR -- a cable falling from the surface, coiling around and

around.

ANGLE ON their dufflebags piled in the corner by the door.  They've

been left behind.

INT.  HABITAT HALLWAY -- LATER

LOOKING DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR -- it's quiet.  WE PEEK inside the

cafeteria...

INT.  CAFETERIA

Barnes speaks to the team (minus Harry and Norman)...

INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

CLOSE ON HARRY'S FACE

Harry lies on his bunk.  He begins to slowly awake.

WE BEGIN TO HEAR A SCRATCHING NOISE, like nails on a chalkboard.  It

gets LOUDER as Harry comes to.  He puts his fingers to his temples.

Norman stands beside, him writing in his notebook.

ANGLE ON Norman's pen -- as he stops writing, the NOISE stops.

Harry sighs.  Norman looks down at his pen.

Harry pauses, staring almost like a frightened little boy.

Harry doesn't say anything.  Norman waiting...

INT.  BATHROOM/SHOWER FACILITIES

Beth comes out from behind a vinyl shower curtain.  A towel wrapped

around her.

Barnes washes his hands at the sink, looking at her in the mirror in

front of him.

He walks to the door, then turns.

INT.  HABITAT HALLWAY

A LONG CORRIDOR -- LOOKING into the cafeteria...

INT.  CAFETERIA

Harry is eating at a table, seems more relaxed.  The team members

around him, eating too.  Beth, cold.  Harry sprinkles salt on the dish

of food in the middle.

Harry stops mid-chew.  Frightened.

Harry drops his fork.  He begins COUGHING.  HACKING.  CHOKING loudly.

GAGGING.  He HACKS out the squid from his mouth...

INT.  HABITAT CORRIDOR

A long, empty corridor.  All is quiet.

EXT.  HABITAT -- UNDERWATER

SWARMS of pretty, pink JELLYFISH.  Everywhere.

FROM UNDER THE HABITAT -- Fletcher swims up to them with a net.  It's

beautiful.  Eerie.  Almost idyllic.

INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

Harry, on his bunk with decoding papers in his hands, turns to Norman,

entering the room.

suit...

Fletcher's suit tears...

ON BETH -- bolting out of the room.  Barnes turning to her...

ON FLETCHER -- UNDERWATER -- jellyfish eating into her plastic

faceplate... she's COUGHING, GASPING.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

They watch...

ON THE MONITOR -- Her body twisting, contorting.  Her suit, ripping

apart.  SCREAMING.  She convulses.  Her body falling.

HER HORRIFYING SCREAM FADING INTO...

INT.  DECONTAMINATION LAB

CLOSE ON -- Fletcher's face.  Cold, dead.  Eyes open.  Jellyfish rooted in

her skin.

INT.  LABRATORY

CLOSE ON A MICROSCOPIC IMAGE of a jellyfish.

ON NORMAN -- in the corner of the lab, inspecting a MEDICAL KIT.

Beth, looking into the microscope.

Norman picks up a book, next to the kit: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

Walking toward her...

Beth, nervous...

She backs away from Norman, knocking off a speciman jar, it SHATTERS

on the floor.  She starts breaking down.

Norman watching her, falling to the ground, picking up the glass,

hurriedly...

She's crying, glass in her hands.  She looks up at Norman, frightened,

nervous...

Norman hesitates, goes to her, tries to hold her, but she pushes him

away.

INT.  HABITAT -- HALLWAY

LOOKING DOWN -- at the room where Barnes was on the phone earlier.  He

stands there now, hand on the knob.

CLOSES it shut.

They stare, stunned, at the screen.

"Are you the entity HECHO in Mexico?"

"Are you the entity made in the U.S.A.?"

Harry types: "We are.  Who are you?"

Reply:

"We are"

Harry types: "We are the entities from the U.S.A.  Who are you?"

"Entities = entity?"

Harry: "No"

"You are a many entity?"

"No.  We are many separate entities."

"I understand.  Is there one control entity?"

"Yes.  The control entity is Captain Harald Barnes"

Harry: "Who are you?"

"I am one"

"Where are you from?"

"I am here"

"Where is the location from where you began?"

"I am from AWARENESS"

"Where is AWARENESS?"

"AWARENESS is"

"Did you make a journey?"

"Yes.  Did you make a journey?"

"Yes"

"I make a journey.  You make a journey.  We make a journey together.  I

am Happy."

"Do Not Be Afraid"

The all stare at the screen, stunned.

"Every word"

Norman walks up to the screen, close to it.

"Yes Norman"

Barnes goes to the intercom...

Norman focuses on the screen, staring.

ON THE SCREEN -- blank.

Norman concentrating, on the screen.

THE SCREEN -- blank.

"Yes, Norman"

"I do not wish to Intrude"

"I do not agree.  That is not possible.  I enjoy to talk with you."

"Let us talk now"

"Thank you"

"Do Not Be Afraid"

"Am I offended you?"

"I shall oblige"

"But I am Not Happy"

ON TED AND NORMAN -

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

An empty chair.  Edmunds is not here.  WE HEAR a repeating THUMP.  THUMP.

THUMP.

ON A MONITOR -- WE SEE her body, wedged in a light stand bracket,

floating in the water, lifeless.  Her helmet THUMPING against the wall

of the habitat.

INT.  UNDERWATER -- OUTSIDE THE HABITAT

Norman and Beth, in jumpsuits and helmets, walk out from under the

habitat.  Still HEARING the THUMPING.  They pause, looking around.

They go to the south end of the habitat.  The THUMPING louder.

Norman climbs up the grid-like STANCHION, the support beam holding up

the habitat.  The BODY above him -- flapping in the current.  THUMPING

against the wall.

He climbs, reaching the body.  A BOOT swings, catches the LOOP in his

air hose.  BUBBLES shoot out.

The BOOT comes off in Norman's hand -- and the NAKED FOOT, gray flesh,

purple toenails, KICKS his faceplate.  Startles him.

ON EDMUNDS' SUIT -- a long TEAR in the fabric, revealing red, mangled

FLESH.  Droplets of BLOOD float past Norman's faceplate.

Norman pulls her body out.

Edmunds' FACEPLATE whips around -- and Norman SEES her staring eyes,

mouth open in horror.

WE HEAR A SENSOR: PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

Barnes at the monitors, Ted with him.

PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

Barnes flips a switch...

No reply.

No reply.

INT.  LABRATORY

CLOSE ON AN EGG

Beth, scalpel in hand, is making an incision into the shell.

Barnes, Norman, Harry and Ted stand around the table.

ON THE EGG -- splitting open.  A slimy pinkish-brown FLUID oozes out.  A

FETUS underneath.

They cover their mouths from the smell.

Beth picks at it with forceps...

Beth glares at Barnes...

INT.  CLOSET AREA -- DARK

Beth, holding a piece of paper in her hand, pulls Norman inside,

pressing on him...

She shows him the printout in her hand, putting a flashlight on the

words, reads...

He turns to leave...

ON NORMAN -- pausing, staring at her...

She looks at him, piercing into his eyes...

Norman looks at her, concerned, knowing she doesn't believe him...

INT.  CONTROL ROOM

ON THE OXYGEN REGULATOR -- bobbing up and down -- keeping track of the

little that's left.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

Barnes, Norman, Beth, and Ted are gathered around the monitors.  Barnes

addresses Norman...

They turn to the monitors:

ON THE MONITOR: "DO NOT IGNORE ME"

"Don't underestimate my power"

"Yes you do"

THE MONITOR blinks back -- WE SEE the sphere.  It is closed.  Still.

WE HEAR the SENSOR: PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

INT.  LABRATORY

Harry, alone, stares at THE FETUS on the table.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

ON THE SONAR IMPULSE MONITOR -- lines jumping higher.  PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

Barnes, Norman, Beth, and Ted watching it.

No response.

The MONITOR flashes: "I'm Not Listening" -- blinks back.

AN OUTSIDE CAMERA FEED -- infra-red -- a large IMAGE streaks by.

Barnes flips a switch...

No response.

THE MONITORS -- BEEPING now.

PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

THE MONITORS blink: "I AM COMING".  The monitor blinks to BLANK.

Ted goes out the door.

ALL THE MONITORS -- blank.

They HEAR a metallic CLANKING.

THE MONITORS blink: "I AM HERE".

INT.  LABRATORY

Harry looking at the FETUS on the table.  It suddenly SLIDES down the

table.

The room is rocked.

ON SHELVES -- Jars, petry dishes, test tubes SLIDE off shattering to

the floor.

INT.  CORRIDOR

BANG!

TED is thrown ruthlessly against the wall.  His HEAD striking metal,

splitting open his forehead.

THE WALLS -- CRACKING and GROANING.

WATER breaks through a crack, spreading out onto the floor.

Barnes...

INT.  CONTROL ROOM

Ted, stumbles, reaches for the headset...

Blood dripping from his forehead.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

BANG!  They grip onto the console...

INT.  CONTROL ROOM

Ted, drousy, BLOOD gushing from his head, keeping balance, searches

for the PRESSURE GAGE.

Finds the GAGE.  Turns it.

EXT.  HABITAT -- UNDERWATER

AIR BUBBLES burst out of the walls.

INT.  CORRIDOR

ON THE FLOOR -- the WATER scurrying back through the leaks in the wall.

THE PRESSURE GAGE -- the needle RISING...

ON THE HEADSET -- in the air, dangling from it's cord.

Beth and Norman BOLT out the door

INTO THE HALLWAY

Running.  BANG!  They're thrown against the wall.

INT.  CONTROL ROOM

THE PRESSURE GAUGE -- rising, higher, higher.

INT.  CORRIDOR

THUMP!  Norman and Beth, losing their balance, stumbling to their

feet, running...

ON TED -- SLIDING out of the Control Room, down the corridor, taken by

the water.

Beth grabs him, as Norman stumbles

INTO THE CONTROL ROOM

finds the PRESSURE GAGE, shuts it off.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

BANG!  Barnes grips his headset as he's thrown to the floor.

INT.  CONTROL ROOM

Norman grabs the headset, slips it on...

Norman sees it, reads it:

ON BETH -- in the hall, tending to Ted, looks up at Norman.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

INT.  CONTROL ROOM/CORRIDOR

Beth yelling...

ON NORMAN -- turning from Beth, to the lever.

BANG!  The WALLS CREAKING and SCREECHING.

Barnes on the floor, a MONITOR crashes alongside him, SPITTING SPARKS,

flashing: "I WILL KILL YOU"

Norman, sweating...

BANG!  CREAKING, GROANING of metal.

BANG!

ON NORMAN -- puts his hand on the lever.

He PULLS the lever.

INT.  HABITAT

DOWN THE CORRIDORS -- a loud HUM from the generators.  The lights

DIMMING.

BANG!  WE HEAR what seems to be a SQUEAL, as the metal RENDS and

CREAKS.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

An ALARM SOUNDS.

Barnes looks up...

THE WARNING BOARD lights up.

INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

FIRE ROARS out from the walls...

INT.  CORRIDOR

CLOSE ON FIRE EXTINGUISHER CASE -- Beth whips it open, grabs it.

ON NORMAN -- picking up Ted, lugging him awkwardly over his shoulder.

ON BARNES -- running down the corridor towards them.

BANG!  Barnes falls to the floor, taken away by the water.

ANOTHER CASE ON THE WALL -- whips open -- Beth grabs GAS MASKS.  She

hears...

She looks DOWN THE CORRIDOR at...

BARNES -- on the floor, flailing in the water, SCREAMING, as his legs

are caught in a CRACK in the wall.  Desperate...

ON BETH -- staring at him.  Just watching him.  Not moving.

BARNES -- his body falling through the crack, his HEAD BANGS into the

wall, stuck in the crack, water choking him...

... trying to SCREAM, his NECK RIPPING, SNAPS, and his body vanishes

into the ocean.

ON BETH -- cold, turns away.

INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

FIRE blasts out from the wall...

BETH and NORMAN (still with Ted) wearing GAS MASKS, RUSH into the

room...

Beth sprays WHITE FOAM on the fierce FLAMES, licking up the side

padding, smoke boils to the cieling.

BANG!  The room is rocked.

Norman falls to the floor, losing Ted.

TED -- SLIDES away and UNDER the computer CONSOLE.

BANG!  The computer CONSOLE breaks -- COMPUTERS, MONITORS, fall,

CRUSHING on Ted's legs.  He SCREAMS out in agony.

NORMAN scrambles towards him through the smoke when...

THE CONSOLE catches fire, erupts in flame.  Ted underneath it.

BETH -- her extinguisher out of foam.

NORMAN -- runs to a wall, finds an EXTINGUISHER CASING, it's been bent,

can't get it open.

TED -- reaches out in desperation as his LEGS catch fire.

NORMAN -- BASHES the casing in with his shoulder, grabs the

extinguisher, turns...

TED -- his entire body on fire.

BANG!  Norman falls, dropping the extinguisher -- it rolls across the

floor.  He reaches out -- can't get it.

CLOSE ON TED -- his face burning...

BANG!  The lights go out.

DARKNESS

NORMAN -- watches in horror as he watches TED, lit in flame, burning to

death.

NORMAN -- reaches for the wall for balance, grabs METAL, and he's

ELECTRICUTED.  Falls backward, head first, and EVERYTHING GOES...

BLACK

A long beat.

INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

WE FOCUS in on Norman, as he awakens.  NAVY SEAMAN, 40s, African-

American, standing above him.

The Navy Seaman helps Norman to his feet.  Norman is smiling, it's

over.

INT.  HALLWAY

Norman and the Navy Seaman walk down the hall.

Norman sighs, smiling.  The relief, the jubilation.

As Norman looks up, the Navy Seaman, still walking and nodding, begins

to slowly DISAPPEAR.  Disintigrating.  VANISHING before his eyes.

Norman stops, looks around him.  He's gone.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

Norman watches on a monitor -- the VIDEO of him walking down the hall,

the Navy Seaman walking next to him.

ON THE MONITOR -- the Seaman disappers.

Norman stops tape.  Looks over at the MONITOR showing the SPHERE.  It is

closed.

THE SCREEN goes BLACK.  Flashes up: "Hello Norman"

"Yes Norman"

"The entity Navy Seaman was a Manifestation.  Did you have a Happy

talk?"

"Did you have a Happy talk?"

"No."

A beat.

"Stop calling me Jerry"

The MONITOR shuts off.

Norman looks over at ANOTHER MONITOR labled "AIRLOCK FEED".

ON THE SCREEN -- Beth is putting on her jumpsuit.

INT.  AIRLOCK

REFLECTED IN THE POOL OF WATER -- WE SEE Beth, slipping on her boots.

Norman stands in the doorway...

She begins to put on her helmet, when she stops.

She goes to it.  Brings it to him.

She hands him a BRIEFCASE, the tapes inside.

EXT.  UNDERWATER

Norman drops to the bottom with the BRIEFCASE.  Lands on the ground.

BREATHING.  Checks his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.  She must've fixed it.

He walks along, out from under the habitat.  Carefully, looking around.

Norman, hesitantly, ventures out.  The DARK WATER.  Looking around.

Anything could be out here.  Walking.  WE HEAR him BREATHING.  His

BREATHING gets shorter.  He looks at his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.

His BREATHING is short, but managable.  He continues on.

AHEAD OF HIM -- the DOME HANGER attached to a large, gray cylinder,

forty feet high.

UNDERNEATH THE DOME HANGER -- Norman climbs up to the hatch DOOR.  Looks

below him.  Nothing around him.  He SPINS the wheel, and pushes the

HATCH OPEN.  Lifts himself up, awkwardly.  Grabs HANDHOLDS, and PULLS

himself up into the POCKET OF AIR trapped inside the dome.

THE SUB -- in front of him.  He finds the hatch, opens it, climbs inside

the sub.

INT.  SUB

Norman sits in the small seat.

No answer.  He bangs at his helmet...

He searches the sub's CONTROL PANEL.  Gadgets, switches, buttons.  Up

top -- a flashing red-lit BUTTON: "TIMER HOLD".  Punches it.  It stops

flashing, and a small screen glows: "TIMER RESET -- COUNT: 12:00:00".

It begins counting backwards.

No answer.  He looks at the Control Panel:

A VIDEO SCREEN with the choices: "DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE,

SHUTDOWN... "

THUMP!

The sub slightly SWAYS.

Norman sits still, nervous.

THUMP!  Harder this time.

Norman looks through the GLASS WINDSHIELD.  Sweating.  Can't see

anything in here.

BANG!  It SWAYS faster, harder, back and forth.  He grips the seat.

THUMP!  BANG!  He's thrown around in the sub.  He can't see anything,

tosses around.  He reaches for the doorhandle.

BANG!  He looses grip, his legs fly up in the air.  The Sub almost turns

over on it's side.

His HELMET BANGS into the glass, WE SEE his look of terror.  Water

SPLASHING up from below.

Then, EVERYTHING stops.

The sub SWAYS to a still.  He sits quietly.  Waiting.  Listening.

Reaches for the doorhandle, cautiously climbs out.

Stands on top of the sub.  Keeping balance.  He looks around, finds a

DOOR inside the dome.  Tries to open it.  Locked.

Looks around.  Nothing else.  Looks down at the water.  Can he risk it?

His BREATHING short.

No reply.  He dips his leg slowly, quietly into the water.  Grimacing.

Then, cautiously slips down into the water...

EXT.  UNDERWATER

CLOSE ON HIS FACE -- terrified.  Looking everywhere.  Searching.  Doesn't

see anything.  Lands on the bottom.

His LIFE SUPPORT BADGE beeping.  Shortness of BREATH.

He walks, trying to run, out from under the dome hanger.  The DARK

WATER.  Can't see anything.  Scared to death.

THE HABITAT -- ahead of him.

Norman goes to a STANCHION.  Grips onto it.  Twists around.  Looking.

Searching.  Doesn't see anything.  LIFE SUPPORT BADGE bleeping faster.

Barely BREATHING.

Norman, twists around, and as he does...

A SEA SNAKE

HISSES at his faceplate.  Norman SCREAMS.

ON HIS HAND -- holding the snake, not the girder, lets go.

Norman falls... looking up: The SNAKE wrapped around the STANCHION,

slithering between the grid-like posts.

THE SNAKE'S HEAD comes at Norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom.

Backpeddaling on his arms and feet.  THE SNAKE, HISSING, coming at him.

It's long TONGUE flicking at him, inches from his faceplate.  Norman

backpeddaling, can't BREATHE, the SNAKE coming down on him, Norman

falls on his back, the TONGUE WHIPPING across his faceplate, when...

NORMAN is whisked up.

HARRY has him by the collar of his suit.  Taking him up.

INT.  AIRLOCK

They burst out of the water.  Harry throws Norman onto the floor.

Unhooks his helmet -- Norman BREATHES, fast and furious.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Norman, panting, walks with Harry...

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

Norman and Harry at the mic...

Harry shakes his head: "no way".

Harry covers the mic...

Harry uncovers the mic...

INT.  CAFETERIA

Norman, sitting at a table, eating a couple pieces of cold chicken.

A salad, some fruit, and boxes of crackers on the table.

Beth walks in, carrying a bag of food.

TO HER LEFT -- she looks -- HARRY is standing in a doorway, cold,

holding Norman's jumpsuit.  He turns away.

ON BETH -- looking back at Norman, tears rolling down her eyes.

INT.  AIRLOCK

Harry neatly hangs Norman's jumpsuit under the hook labled: "JOHNSON".

Smoothens it out for him.

INT.  CAFETERIA

ON BETH -- sitting at a table, her face in her hands.

ON NORMAN -- looking at her, as he closes a box of crackers.  Wraps

cellophane over the chicken.  Walks with it over to the refridgerator.

Opens it, placing the chicken inside... but he can't.

INSIDE THE REFRIDGERATOR

are BOOKS -- neatly lined up on each of the shelves.

NORMAN -- backs away.  What the hell?

Norman now looks at the CUPBOARDS.  Goes to them.

INSIDE THE CUPBOARD

Books, neatly stacked.

Norman, panicking, opens each of the cupboards, all of them with

BOOKS.

All of the books are the same.  Entitled: "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea

by Jules Verne."

Norman looks over at Beth.

She comes to him.  He stands there, bewildered, scared, mind racing.

Norman paces, frantic almost, running his hands through his hair,

trying to think.  Stops.  Turns to Beth.

Norman quickly plucks a book from a shelf, turns pages, gets to page

87.  Reads...

He looks up from the book, realizing something...

SNAPS the book closed.

INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

CLOSE ON HARRY'S DUFFLEBAG -- Norman rifles through notebooks.  Turning

pages.

TEARS off the first Jerry transmission.

Beth, standing at the doorway, keeping watch down the hall.

Norman grabs Harry's YELLOW PAD OF PAPER.

THEIR FEET -- scurrying through the water soaked corridor.

Norman ushers her into the Control Room.  Looks around.  SHUTS the door.

INT.  CONTROL ROOM

Norman SCRIBBLES on the printout, glancing at the yellow pad of

paper...

Norman stops, staring at the pad.

Norman picks up the pad of paper, reads...

INT.  CORRIDOR

Harry is walking towards the Living Quarters...

BACK IN -- CONTROL ROOM

IN -- THE LIVING QUARTERS

It's dark.  Harry lies on his bunk, asleep.

Harry opens his eyes, stares at us.

WE BEGIN TO HEAR A LOW INSISTENT BEEPING...

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

ON SCREEN -- a transmission comes across...

"CQX VDX MOP LKI... "

Beth and Norman watch...

Harry leaning against the doorframe, enters the room.

Norman watching them...

THE SCREEN -- jumbling it's letters until finally...

"SURFACE SUPPORT VESSELS TO YOUR LOCATION ETA: 1600 HOURS.  END."

Norman and Beth smile...

THE SCREEN -- "16:00:00"... it begins decending in count.

Beth, nervous, tries to cover...

A long beat, as Beth stares at Harry.

Harry looks at both of them, suspiciously...

A tense beat.

Norman glances at THE SCREEN behind Harry: "I WILL KILL YOU ALL."

INT.  LABRATORY

CLOSE ON THE MEDICAL CABINET -- WHIPPING open.

Norman quickly digs through the medicines...

Beth at the computer, looking up the names...

Norman throws it on the floor.  Picks another...

Norman digs, finds paracin trichloride...

BETH -- mixing the medicines...

Beth goes to the cabinet, grabs another medicine.  Norman comes over as

she adds it to the mix...

A beat...

She fills the LARGE SYRINGE with the clear liquid mix.

She hands him the syringe...

Norman looks at the syringe, like it's an assault rifle.

INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

Harry sleeps on his bunk.  The door to the room is closed.

INT.  CAFETERIA

Norman spirals down the stairway from the lab.  Hurrying through the

dark cafeteria, the syringe at his side.

INTO THE HALLWAY

shuffling down the corridor, nervously.  Glancing at the syringe.

ROUNDS A CORNER

and SEES in front of the Living Quarters...

TWO AFRICAN-AMERICAN NAVY CREWMEN -- standing guard of the door.

Norman stops, hides behind the wall.

INT.  LABRATORY

Norman comes in...

Suddenly, BANG!  The room shakes.  Shelves fall.  Cabinet doors swing

open.  Norman falls to the floor.

THE COMPUTER MONITOR -- crashes down in front of his face.  It reads: "I

WILL KILL YOU ALL"

INT.  CORRIDOR

Norman and Beth running...

BANG!  Water shoots through the wall.  Gushing out onto the floor.  The

walls CRACKING.

ON HARRY -- running out of his room...

BANG!  They lose their balance, still running...

BANG!  Another CRACK -- water gushing inside.

Norman grabs Harry, pushes him up against the wall.

Beth takes the syringe from her palm, and STABS Harry in the SHOULDER.

HE SCREAMS IN HORRIFYING PAIN, FADING OVER INTO...

INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR

Quiet now.

INT.  CAFETERIA

Norman and Beth sit at a table, sipping coffee.

ON NORMAN -- watching her, sizing her up.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM -- LATER

ON HARRY -- lying on a STRETCHER in the corner, propped up with pillows

and a blanket.  An IV in his arm.

NORMAN -- at the console, stares at the MONITOR of the SPHERE.  A long

beat.  His reflection staring back at him.  He slips on the headset...

INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

The room is empty.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Empty.

INT.  AIRLOCK

ON THE JUMPSUIT HANGERS -- the jumpsuit under the name "DR. BETH

HALPERIN" is missing.

Norman pouring himself more coffee, alone.

INT.  AIRLOCK

Beth's suit still gone.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

Harry lying on the stretcher, still.

Norman watching him from above, sipping his coffee.

HEARS A SOFT BEEPING

Norman goes to the console, sits.  Checks the monitors.  Looks around

the console, not knowing what it is.

A FLASHING LIGHT on the Sensor Board.  Norman still doesn't know what

it means.

THE MONITORS go blank.

The MONITORS flash up: "I AM COMING."

Norman spins around, goes to HARRY -- lying still.  Norman grabs

Harry's wrist.  Checking pulse.

Norman returns to the console, slips on the headset...

THE MONITORS boot up again.  Norman looks at the SUB VIDEO MONITOR --

the sub is gone from under the dome.

No reply.  MORE BEEPING.  Panicking.  Bangs on the headset.

He scans the MONITORS, looking for movement.  Anything.  They are all

still.

Norman turns to looks at Harry...

CLOSE ON HARRY'S FACE -- still.

BACK ON -- NORMAN, sweating...

Norman looks at the monitors:

ON AN OUTSIDE CAMERA FEED -- a bright LIGHT blinds the SCREEN.  It's

Beth in the sub, moving along the habitat.

The Sub's CLAW ARMS carry large RED BOXES.  The lettering on the boxes

isn't in focus.

Norman squints at the MONITOR -- can't make it out.

The Sub's CLAW ARMS drops one of the BOXES, plumping it softly on the

muddy floor.

ON ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub moves forward.  Churning up the sediment.

It stops again, and releases another box.

Norman BANGS on the headset.

THE MONITORS blink: "I AM COMING FOR YOU"

ON NORMAN -- breathing heavy.

ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub in view -- a closer view.  It releases it's

last box.  Norman can read the lettering now: "CAUTION: TEVAC

EXPLOSIVES"

THE MONITORS flash: "I WILL KILL YOU"

Norman WHIPS off his headset, bursts out of his seat, OPENS a CABINET.

Searching for tapes.  Another cabinet.  Then another.

A shelf labled: "SPHERE" -- all the tapes are gone.

THE MONITORS flash: "I WILL KILL YOU"

ON THE HEADSET -- resting on the console.  WE HEAR faintly...

INT.  CORRIDOR

Norman pushes Harry and his IV down the corridor.  Hurrying.  An inch or

two of water on the floor.

INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

CLOSE ON A METAL CASE -- labled: "Captain Harold Barnes."

Norman BANGS it against the wall, trying to bust the LOCK.  BANGING.

BANGING.  Breaks the lock.  Digs inside the case.

Pulls out a GUN.

INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR

Norman pushing Harry and the IV stand.  Wheels him into...

BATHROOM/SINK AREA

Norman stops.  Turns off the main lights.  The room goes dark.  The

florescent LIGHT above the sinks stay on.

Norman wheels Harry inside, places him by a wall.  Checks the IV.

Norman goes to a STALL.  Steps inside.  Keeps the stall door open.  Can

still see Harry about 10 feet away.

Norman looks at the GUN.  COCKS it.  Pinches his finger.

He waits.  Listening.

A FAINT HIGH-PITCHED HISSING SOUND

Norman looks over at the sinks.

A FAUCET is on.  Water HISSING faintly from it.

Norman ignores it.  Waiting in the dark.  Listening.

ON THE FAUCET -- the water running.

ON NORMAN -- looking at it.  Can't ignore it.  Tries.  But can't.

Norman walks quietly through the inch of water on the floor.

OVER TO THE SINKS

The light above them on.  Norman turns the faucet off.  The water stops.

But the HISSING SOUND remains.

Norman looks at the faucet, queerly.  Turns it back on.  Then off.

The HISSING SOUND still there.  It isn't the water.

Norman looks down at his feet...

THE FLOOR -- seems to be moving.  Something swimming in the water.

CLOSE ON NORMAN'S PANTLEG -- a long, tubular SEA SNAKE slithers up

inside his pantleg, HISSING.  His pants BULGING as the SNAKE slowly

slides up past his knee.

HISSING LOUDER

As more SNAKES comes through the crack in the wall.

NORMAN watches with horror in the mirror in front of him as the SNAKE

slithers up to his groin, and across the inside of his shirt.

Another SNAKE begins WRAPPING itself around the outside of Norman,

sliding up around his neck.

WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COME FROM DOWN THE HALL

NORMAN, standing still, watches as more SNAKES crawl up his sides,

slithering around his arms, his shoulders, his neck, under his chin,

over his face.  Their forked tongues FLICKING and HISSING.

NORMAN looking in the MIRROR -- as Beth comes up behind him in her

jumpsuit.

Norman GLARES at her in the mirror.  His body STIFF.

SNAKES covering his eyes, SLITHERING across his mouth.

A SNAKE flicking it's tongue at Norman's lips.  Trying to get inside

his mouth.

She looks at her watch.

She begins grabbing the SNAKES off of him, carefully dropping them to

the ground.  SNAKES writhing in her hands, twisted around her wrists.

Shakes them off.  Some drop in the sink.  She bends out of view -- and

the SNAKE inside Norman's shirt, MOVES back down the way it came.

Past his stomach, his groin.

Norman HEAVES from his chest, VOMITS on the mirror...

INT.  CAFETERIA

CLOSE ON A POT -- pouring a white, milkish DRINK into a cup.

Beth walks it over to Norman, sitting at a table, looking ill.

Norman looks at the cup.

Norman places the cup down.

Beth takes a seat.  Stares at him.  A long beat.

A beat.  She picks up the drink, and begins sipping it.  Norman watches

her.

A long beat between them.

Norman stares up at her, frightened.  Is she right?

Norman looks at her palm -- SEES the NEEDLE in her hand.  Norman backs

up, away.

The GUN in her other hand.

She comes at him, needle in hand...

She lunges at him with the needle, missing.  He RUNS for the SPIRAL

STAIRCASE leading to the lab.  Norman grabs the handrail, begins

climbing the stairs.

Beth's at his feet, grabbing for his ankles.

He frantically crawls up the stairs, her grasping at his heels.

Climbing, climbing -- round and round -- the STAIRS never seem to end.

He looks up:

THE STAIRS -- expanding in front of him, strangely increasing in

number.  He climbs, racing, PANTING.  Beth, right behind him, laughing

almost.

She GRABS his ANKLE.  She raises the NEEDLE.  Norman turns, KICKS her in

the FACE.

She WAILS, blood SPITTING from her nose.

Climbing, climbing.  The STAIRS increasing above.  He LUNGES for the top

step, GRABS it.  Pulls himself up...

INTO THE LAB

Scrambling.  He stares down at Beth -- the GUN pointing at him.

He SLAMS the HATCH DOOR, on top of her, BASHING her head down.  He

holds the DOOR closed.  Trying to regain his breath.

He slides a heavy FILE CABINET over on top of the door.

The door's METAL PIVOT turns...

ON BETH -- on the stairs, spinning the door's WHEEL...

INT.  LABRATORY

Norman staring at the wheel.  CLICK!  It's locked from the outside.

Norman falls to his knees.  PANTING.

INT.  LABRATORY -- LATER

CLOSE ON A SURVEILLANCE VIDEO CAMERA -- in the upper corner of the

room.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

ON A MONITOR -- WE SEE Norman -- sitting in a corner of the lab,

staring up at US.

INT.  LABRATORY

Norman, huddled on the floor.

Norman JUMPS up, looks at the ground -- WATER on the floor.  Rising in

level.

The entire floor is covered in water, rising higher, and rising fast.

Norman, WADING through the water, searching...

Rising higher...

Norman frantically checking for a crack, a leak.

It's up to his waist.  He climbs on top a lab bench.  Puts his hands to

his temples, straining.  WE HEAR Beth laughing.

A SPECIMEN BOTTLE -- EXPLODES right next to him.

Another BOTTLE SHATTERS, shooting fragments of glass across the room.

Microscope lenses CRACK.  Bottles, Test Tubes, Dishes EXPOLDE.

SHATTER!  CRACK!

Bottles floating in the water POP!  The water too high -- Norman

swimming in it now, keeping afloat.  His FACE strains from the

pressure.  He looks at the CAMERA in the corner...

Next to the CAMERA, he SEES the HATCH DOOR in the ceiling.

He reaches up at the door.  Can't get it.  The water rising.  He DIVES

down in the water...

UNDERWATER

He swims to a cabinet near the floor, OPENS it, searches, THINGS

floating out -- AN OXYGEN CYLINDER and MASK -- he GRABS it.

NORMAN'S FACE -- bursts above water level, slips on the mask, BREATHES.

He BREATHES a last breath, reaches up to the ceiling HATCH DOOR, SPINS

it.

The DOOR opens and WATER gushes inside.  He grabs the frame of the

door, and his body shoots up through the hole...

EXT.  OCEAN -- UNDERWATER

His body upside down, his hand holding onto the frame.  He grabs a PIPE

next to it, pulls himself hand over hand, along the pipe.

HIS FACE -- straining from the freezing chill.

MOVING along the pipe, hand over hand.  He loses grip.  His body thrusts

upwards.

CLOSE ON HIS RIGHT HAND -- purple, frozen, holding onto the pipe.

Barely gripping.

HIS FACE -- his eyes fluttering.  He blows air from his mouth, BUBBLES

burst from his lips.

HIS BODY slightly descending.

HIS LEFT HAND -- grips the pipe.  He continues on.

HAND OVER HAND.  Pulling himself...

UNDER THE HABITAT

He SEES the airlock in front of him.

He SCOOTS along, but slower, now.  He stops.  Can't continue.  He clasps

his hand to his CHEST, it's burning.  He SEES the airlock.  His eyes

fluttering, he's losing consciousness.  He can't do it.  And he lets go

of the pipe.

FLOATING UPWARDS -- is he gone?

HIS HEAD -- BANGS into the habitat floor.  His body flat underneath it.

Being sucked upwards against it.

He pushes forward... trying to grab the floor with his hands.  He's

inches from the airlock.

Plants his feet against the wall -- and pushes forward.  His body

SUCKED UP and away...

INT.  AIRLOCK

... His head BURSTS above the water level, BIG BREATH.  GASPING.  He

flails his arms over to the ladder.  Grips the ladder, but his hands

are like ice.  Can't hold it.  He slips.

Flailing in the water.

He HEAVES his chest over the METAL RIM.  Twists his legs around, out of

the water, and flops his body onto the deck.

Shivering.

Tries to get up.  Falls over.  His body shaking.  His lips purple.  His

eyes barely open, looking at...

HIS JUMPSUIT -- hanging on the wall.

Norman crawls toward the suit, his body shaking violently.  He reaches

out for his boots on the floor.  Can't grip them.  Inches his HEAD

toward his suit, tries to BITE at his suit, but his TEETH chattering.

He grips the wall, his hands pulling him up.  He RIPS his suit off the

hanger.

Slipping on his suit, he HEARS a MAN'S voice...

ON NORMAN -- as he slips on his helmet, his teeth -- chattering.

CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK HATCH DOOR -- Norman trying to open it.

Norman turns, dives back in the water.

UNDERWATER

Norman swims out from under the habitat.  Looks around at the

cylinders, the walls.

Goes to the outside of a WALL.  Looking for a CRACK, a LEAK, a way in.

TO HIS LEFT -- Barnes' body, floating, hooked to the wall.

Norman goes to him.  SEES the CRACK.

Climbing inside.  Struggling through the CRACK, careful not to rip his

suit.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Flooded to the top with water.  Completely filled.  Norman emerges

through the crack.  MOVES down the hall.

A BOX OF CORN FLAKES

floats by his faceplate.

Norman pulls at the cylinder's HATCH DOOR.  He HEARS faintly through

his helmet...

He OPENS the door.  Slips inside, the water going with him.

INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

BEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!

A SCREEN -- flashes: "D CYLINDER HATCH DOOR -- OPEN"

The CHAIR in front of the console -- spinning, empty.  Beth just left.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Norman, running.  SEES the B Cylinder door.  Goes to it.  Spins it,

OPENS.

INT.  B CYLINDER

Norman climbs inside, takes off his helmet.

THE CYLINDER -- a maze of pipes and equipment.  Heaters, controls, and

wires everywhere.  Difficult to see.

THROUGH PIPES

WE SEE NORMAN -- walking through the cylinder.  Holding his helmet at

his hip.

He goes to her voice in the back.  Past pipes, equipment.

ON BETH -- huddled in the back corner, wedged among pipes.  Her eyes

red.  Holding the GUN in her hand.  Pointing at Norman as he SEES her

through the pipes.

ABOVER HER HEAD -- a computer SCREEN, reading: "DETONATION SEQUENCE

09:32"... descending in count.

Norman stares up at the SCREEN, concentrating.

She sees HER REFLECTION on a PIECE of BROKEN GLASS on the floor.  She

puts her fingers to her matted hair, tries to comb it.

Over the intercom...

ON THE GUN -- WE SEE Beth's wrists.  The two scars.

Norman walks toward her.  Beth freaks...

BAM!  From behind her -- Harry -- WHACKS Beth across the head with a

WRENCH, sending her to the ground.

Norman goes to her, checking her pulse.

Norman stares at the NUMBERS on the SCREEN above him.

Over the intercom...

Norman RIPS off a piece of her t-shirt, ties it to the wound around

her head.

Norman, carrying Beth in his arms, races awkwardly down the hall...

Harry does.

jumpsuit.

EXT.  UNDERWATER

Norman carrying Beth on his back, hurries through the water.

EXT.  UNDERWATER

UNDERNEATH THE SUB'S DOME HANGER

Norman tries to climb up the ladder with Beth on his back.  She falls

off, deadweight to the ground.

Harry leans down from the Sub's airlock...

Norman pushes her up to him, but she bends at the waist.

Norman flops her up in the air, but she bends again at the waist.

He flops her up again.

Norman loses grip, drops her.

Picking her up...

Norman flops her up once more, and Harry grabs her AIR HOSE.

Harry pulls her toward the airlock, Norman climbs up after.

INT.  SUB AIRLOCK

The pocket of air around the sub.  The three of them crammed inside.

Norman opens the door on top of the sub.

Norman takes Beth and pushes her on top the sub.  The sub sways back

and forth.

They lose balance, Beth almost falls, Norman catches her.

Harry jumps on top of the sub.  Slides inside it.  Reaches his arms out,

catching Beth's legs.

Beth's LEG swings up and hits Harry in the helmet.

Harry pulls Beth down inside, as Norman steps on top of the sub, helps

push Beth's head inside.

Norman drops inside.

INT.  SUB

Norman in the seat.  Beth's leg hangs over his right shoulder.  Harry

looks at Norman who assesses the flight controls.

Norman presses a button.

THE SCREEN -- blinks: "DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE, SHUTDOWN... "

Norman hits "ASCEND".  The Sub WHIRRS, RUMBLES and drops down below.

Norman works the steering wheel, gliding it upwards.

EXT.  UNDERWATER

The SUB comes out from under the dome.  Rising above the habitat...

EXT.  UNDERWATER

The sub ascends past the spacecraft tail fin.

INT.  SUB

Harry looking down below him...

Harry just stares at Norman.  Norman grabs Beth, trying to stablilize

her.

Harry laughs.

Ascending... waiting... and then...

A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION below them...

Rocking the sub, spinning it up and around, surging it upwards to the

surface.

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- RACING toward the surface, toward the

SUNLIGHT -- it's BLINDING -- and the screen GOES WHITE.

INT.  DECOMPRESSION ROOM

A pale, white room.

ON NORMAN -- sleeping.  His eyes begin to open.  He awakes.

BETH -- is next to him, looking at him.  There is a long beat.

Norman looks up at her...

She stares back at him, and smiles.  Begins laughing with him.

EXT.  DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER

TWO NAVY CREWMEN stand outside the door, looking in.

Looking INSIDE -- Norman, Harry, and Beth sit at a table.

At the table...

A long beat.

She smiles.
