INT. A BLACK SCREEN

INT. CLOSE 0N - A HIGH-TECH RESIDENTIAL STEEL DOOR

being POUNDED in. WHAM! WHAM! Whoever's trying to get in is

serious. The door shudders but doesn't give. It's state-of-

the-art residential protection.

We hear the WHRRRRR of POWER TOOLS going to work on his door.

These people are determined. Professional. And prepared.

EXT. THE CELESTIAL - LOOKING INTO THE LOBBY - NIGHT

The sleek lobby is deserted. We SEE, through the GLASS, lying

on the floor, the barest glimpse of the FEET of what are

presumably TWO DEAD SECURITY GUARDS -- although their bodies

are largely hidden behind their massive curly walnut desk.

All the security monitors are BLACK -- the feeds clearly cut.

The CAMERA RISES, breathlessly, in a blur, up all 80 floors

of this stunning new building, coming to rest on...

EDDIE MORGAN,

30's, lean and stylish, standing on the exterior ledge of his

multimillion-dollar terrace. New York City looms around him,

beneath him. His hands are outstretched. Balancing. He is

calm, but fatalistic. He's clearly going to jump.

His attention is CAUGHT by the SOUNDS of a commotion in the

next apartment. He looks over, at-

THE ADJOINING TERRACE

Through the gauzy curtains of the window, TWO MEN force A

MIDDLE-AGED MAN towards the windows... there is arguing.

Two MUFFLED SHOTS - the neighbor drops. The door is pounded

again. It doesn't give.

The pounding intensifies.

He looks over the railing...

His smile is bitter, as we CUT TO:

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

Eddie is walking down the street, messily eating a street

falafel. His hair is longer, his clothes schlumpier, his face

rounder --he's out of shape. A belly bulges against his belt.

He wears jeans and that worn-out corduroy "writer's" sport

coat --the one that your girlfriend fights to give to the

Salvation Army.

INT. EDDIE'S RATTY RENT-CONTROLLED APARTMENT ON AVENUE A- DAY

Eddie, slumped in his desk chair, is playing COMPUTER

SCRABBLE.

QUICK CUTS: --Eddie sprawled on the couch, eating takeout and

watching TV, the sink in the foreground full of dishes. --

Eddie shooting baskets into a toy hoop.

--Eddie sleeping in his bed, sacked out, the clock beside him

clicking to 11:59 a.m.

--Eddie sitting on the john, playing a game on his childhood

Game Boy.

--Eddie at his desk. He glances at his LAND LINE. The

message light is unblinkingly green. No one's called.

His POV PANS to the FOOT HIGH STACK OF UNPAID bills next to

the answering machine.

INT. A MIDTOWN COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A FEMALE HAND slides a KEY across the counter to EDDIE. Eddie

stares in disbelief at his (now ex) girlfriend, LINDY, an

attractive, real-looking girl, late 20's. She's dressed in a

professional suit. She looks very sad.

Eddie is broadsided. Hurt.

She shoots him a look of almost intolerable sympathy.

He tries to push the key back. He cares about her, but he's

also "working" her sympathy, which she instantly smells.

She pierces Eddie with a look. Doesn't take the key.

They both almost laugh. They know each other so well. But

she looks away, steeling herself.

Eddie sighs. Drops the glib tone. Looks at her, finally

mustering the honesty she deserves.

Lindy looks at him, clear-eyed, seeing him as he is, and

loving him anyway.

She looks away. Its hard for her to admit this:

FLASH!

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

We are in Eddie's mind, in his POV, and we are seeing a

LOVELY, WILLOWY BRUNETTE, wearing an undershirt, bending

seductively over him...

INT. MIDTOWN COFFEE SHOP - DAY

From Eddie's eyes we can tell the memory is still fresh. She

shakes her head, looks away. It's clearly over. She gets up.

He follows.

We can see on Lindy's face that she's still vulnerably

pleased that Eddie remembered to ask.

She smiles weakly, breaks eye contact. No good to keep

looking. It's over. Eddie makes an attempt to reach for the

check, which Lindy grabs.

He knows she knows he can't pay.

EXT. MIDTOWN STREET - DAY

Eddie is walking home, eying the homeless on the street,

feeling his dismal future breathing down his neck.

He's interrupted by A VOICE - calm, amused:

VERNON GANT looks him over with condescending bemusment. He's

30, wears an expensive suit, looks like he comes from money.

He genially whacks the sides of Eddie's arms. Eddie

halfheartedly whacks back. Vernon sizes Eddie up.

Eddie didn't need that. He's very self-conscious about his

weight.

Vern looks half suspicious, half impressed.

Eddie sizes him up: the suit, shoes, watch, haircut.

Vern plucks the pack of cigarettes from Eddie's upper jacket

pocket.

He holds the cigarettes just out of Eddie's reach.

INT. BAR - DAY

A BARTENDER brings beers to Eddie and Vernon who sit at the

bar. Eddie clearly wishes he were elsewhere.

INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT (AN ALMOST SUBLIMINAL FLASH)

Melissa, naked, silhouetted in the bathroom door. BACK TO:

INT. BAR - DAY

This is unfathomable to Eddie. He tries to keep his voice

casual.

FLASH!

INT. SAME APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

Melissa, her lovely face over a mirror, doing lines. BACK TO:

INT. BAR - DAY

Vernon can sense his emotion.

It unexpectedly hurts Eddie. Maybe it's just a bummer day. Or

there's a deeper wound than he knew.

A beat.

Vern appraises him.

He reaches into his pocket. Eddie thinks he knows what's

coming.

A long beat. Eddie bites.

Vern reaches into his jacket, produces a tiny plastic sachet

with his right hand, tapping something out into the palm of

his left. He holds this up for Eddie to see... a TINY WHITE

UNMARKED TABLET.

Vern puts the little white tablet on the bar.

Vern's phone rings. He holds up his index finger --shh! -and

takes the call.

Vern is edgy. Very tense. He continues:

He turns off his phone, gets up.

He takes out his business card, and places it carefully next

to the little white tablet on the bench.

Vern smiles at him.

Eddie shakes his head.

He pats Eddie on the shoulder and goes. Eddie is still

looking at the pill.

Which seems to be looking back at him.

EXT. THE STREET - DUSK

Eddie makes his way home, a little tipsy and filled with self-

loathing.

FLASH!

A memory -- Melissa's face as she's talking, laughing.

INT. A DOWNTOWN PARTY - PARTY - NIGHT

Melissa, sparkling, beautiful, surrounded by people, in

intense conversation with a bunch of downtown types.

The men gasp, shocked and titillated. The women are furious.

Melissa smiles to herself --she's trying not to crack up.

We HOLD ON MELISSA'S LOVELY, CONFIDENT FACE as her voice

fades down and Eddie's fades in.

INT. A DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN BEHIND A DESK - DAY

--getting SPLATTERED by some ochre liquid from an offscreen

source.

INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

A YOUNGER, THINNER EDDIE rifles through a bureau, an old lady

in bed, sleeping, behind him --an oxygen mask on her. She's

clearly terminal.

EXT. THE STREET - DUSK

Eddie walks, pensive.

EXT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - DUSK

An edgy neighborhood on the furthest edge of lower Manhattan.

This block may never be gentrified.

He digs in his pocket for the keys and comes up with...

THE LITTLE WHITE PILL

INT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DUSK

It's a former tenement, fourth-floor walk-up. Eddie trudges

up the old stairs, the tiny tiles worn away in spots, the

Victorian moldings disfigured from a hundred and twenty years

of paint.

Eddie is suddenly seized by a racking cough -- a horrible

smoker's cough that makes him double over. He sounds like

he's 80 years old. He finally gets it under control, gets a

glimpse of himself in the storefront window. He looks bad,

and he knows he looks bad.

He reaches into his pocket. THE PILL sits teasingly in the

palm of his hand, looking up at him.

Quickly, impulsively, he swallows it.

INT. THE LANDING - DUSK

As Eddie passes, a neighbor's door swings open. Eddie tries

walking faster.

VALERIE, 26 and attractive, emerges, dressed to go out.

She is immediately soured at the sight of Eddie. Eddie knows

what she's thinking.

Valerie's tirade FADES up or down, depending on when we're

hearing Eddie.

Eddie continues up the stairs. But she follows, getting in

front of him.

VALERIE'S voice fades up.

We PUSH IN on Eddie's face, into his eyes... where we see his

pupils contract just slightly. A flicker.

EDDIE'S POV - THE APARTMENT UPPER HALL...

The room is changing... springing into sharper focus.

There seems to be more definition, more dimension, a little

more light -- he can see more clearly. The SOUND drops out

for a moment; he can see VALERIE'S FACE, mouth contorted,

continuing to heap the abuse, but there's something in her

eyes that's not mean... something anxious.He looks at her

with a sudden keen intelligence. And sympathy.

She's taken aback.

His eyes go to THE BOOK BAG in her arms.

On a gut instinct, Eddie takes a shot, pushing his words

forward with a new, sharp, penetrating intimacy,

articulateness.

He's hit a nerve.

His eyes flick down at her bag.

He looks down. She's right --only a corner of the book is

visible. Eddie realizes:

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

A slightly younger Eddie is flipping through the Lange book.

INT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - LANDING - DAY

ON EDDIE'S FACE - CLOSE

As it sinks in:

Eddie's eyes flick to the laptop in her bag, his manner

suddenly intimate, confident.

During this speech, MUSIC COMES UP and the sound goes down...

SEVERAL QUICK CUTS...

Eddie and Valerie's mouths are moving... she's asking

questions... he's supplying answers, lots of them...

Valerie's whole posture is relaxing, the look in her eyes

becoming... friendly.

INT. THE DOWNSTAIRS APARTMENT FROM EDDIE'S - NIGHT

A mirror image of Eddie's, but considerably nicer. We HEAR

the SOUNDS of two people -- Valerie and Eddie -- HAVING WILD,

mutually satisfying SEX from the other room.

We see the laptop set up, books scattered -- then, obviously

abandoned for a more pleasurable pursuit.

We HEAR female groans of pleasure. Laughter.

INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A dishevelled Eddie opens the door to his apartment. He

enters, looks around.

EDDIE'S POV - HIS LIVING ROOM

It's the first wide shot we've seen of it, and it hammers

home: what a mess. Books scattered across the floor, dirty

dishes, broken Venetian blind sashes. The nest of a slob.

MONTAGE: Speeded-up shots of Eddie sifting through his books

and tapes. Cleaning up the kitchen. The bathroom. Picks up

books. He starts moving the sofa.

QUICK CUTS: the living room, rapidly whipped into shape. If

not stylish, habitable. Final shot: he's sitting on the

(repositioned) couch. Thinking.

He stares at the pack in his hands. It looks alien.

He gets up. Paces.

His eye falls on his COMPUTER.

The MONTAGE CONTINUES: Eddie flipping through research books,

typing onto his keyboard, the printer printing, doing

Internet searches... pages and pages spit out of the printer.

INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Eddie, in his underwear, is sleeping soundly. He stirs, rolls

over, cracks open an eye.

He gets up, schlumps to the mirror, looks at his unshaven

face. The penetrating gleam is no longer in his eyes.

CLOSE UP -- EDDIE'S UNDERWEAR is tossed at the hamper -

missing it by about a foot. The underwear remain on the

floor.

INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Eddie lies on the couch. (Already the room shows signs of

being messed up again.) His eye suddenly falls on his desk.

INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Eddie drops A STACK OF FRESH PAGES on the desk of MARK

SUTTON. Mark looks skeptically at Eddie, then the pages.

Eddie knows he's on thin ice.

EXT. FLATIRON DISTRICT - DAY

Eddie standing on the street, the crowd flowing around him.

He turns this way and that, clearly anxious, impatient. Where

to go? What to do to kill the time?

EXT. STREET - DAY - THREE SHOTS:

1. Eddie orders a PRETZEL from a food cart. He is having to

dig into his pockets to come up with the change. The VENDOR

becomes so impatient he won't give him the pretzel, and

serves another customer first. Eddie looks at HIS CELL

PHONE. Makes sure it's on. No call.

2. Eddie sits on a stoop, slowly nibbling on his pretzel, his

eye glued to his phone. No call.

3. Eddie tosses the finished pretzel's wrapper and SHAKES HIS

PHONE in frustration. A RING! Eddie jumps up, fumbles with

his phone just as a passing male WALL STREET SHARK pulls out

his phone and answers. The ring wasn't for Eddie.

INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Eddie comes in, then notices something's different. His

ANSWERING MACHINE has a blinking red light. Eddie clicks the

button, breathless.

The second message is from Mark too.

A third message - BEEP!

Eddie jumps up, gleeful-- he knew it! Then his smile fades.

Reality hits.

EXT. VERN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Eddie, holding Vern's card, buzzes the buzzer. There's no

answer. Eddie buzzes again and again. Finally:

The buzzer buzzes.

INT. VERN'S APARTMENT DOOR - DAY

The door opens. And Eddie is taken aback. Vern has been

beaten up. Really worked over. His lip is split, his face

puffy and bruised. His right hand is bandaged.

Leaving the door open, Vern turns around and motions at Eddie

with his left hand to come in. The place is all mismatched

antique furniture -- the possessions of someone who collected

once, with enthusiasm, but who's letting it all go to hell.

Vern sits, keeping his injured arm elevated.

Eddie can't get over how bad Vernon looks.

And Eddie wants the drug more than he wants to know what

happened.

Eddie stares at Vern as he pours himself a coffee.

Vern chuckles. He knew it.

Eddie wants to get on with it and get out of there, but Vern

clearly has him by the balls.

Eddie sighs. Vern tosses him a set of KEYS.

INT. A DRY CLEANER'S AUTOMATED CLOTHING RACK - DAY

As the plastic-wrapped clothes spin towards us...

INT. A DINER GRIDDLE - DAY

As two eggs are flipped, over easy.

INT. VERNON'S BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

And here comes Eddie, carrying Vernon's suit, and greasy bag

of breakfast...

He arrives at Vernon's door. He takes out the keys Vern gave

him, but he doesn't need them. The DOOR is AJAR.

INT. VERN'S APARTMENT - DAY - EDDIE'S POV

As Eddie pushes the door open, he can see Vernon sitting,

quite normally, on the couch. As he enters the room, though,

he sees that the place has been RANSACKED. Destroyed.

Eddie wheels back to ask Vern what the fuck. And then sees

it.

VERN'S FACE -CLOSE

In the center of his forehead is a neat little BULLET HOLE.

is no tough guy, and sweat springs to his brow. He starts

shaking... then, seized with horror that they might still be

in here, he edges to the bedroom. We hear THE POUNDING OF HIS

HEART as he peeks in...

INT. EDDIE'S POV - VERN'S BEDROOM

It's been ransacked, too. Torn to shreds, bureau drawers

opened and dumped, pillows ripped open with knives. But no

one is there.

INT. VERNON'S DESK - DAY

Eddie's shaking hand can barely hold the phone.

He puts down the phone, puts his head in his hands.

VARIOUS CUTS OF: Eddie sitting. Shifting his butt in various

positions. Holding a BASEBALL BAT he's found --just in case

"they" come back.

CLOSE ON - EDDIE'S FACE

INT. VERN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Eddie, cleverly wearing kitchen gloves, is now furiously

tearing through the rubble the thieves have left behind, the

scattered clothes, under the bed...

INT. BATHROOM -. DAY

Eddie pokes quickly through the medicine cabinet -- nothing

but Tylenol.

INT. VERN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Eddie sits on the couch with (dead) Vern, staring at him, as

if a corpse could give up a secret. He looks down at VERN'S

BREAKFAST CONTAINER.

There are lots of takeout containers around.

Eddie's eye falls on VERN'S STOVE. Unlike the rest of the

kitchen area, it's pristine. Unspattered. Eddie jumps up.

VERN'S STOVE - CLOSE

Eddie opens it. The inside is as clean as the outside. We

HEAR SIRENS now -- the cops are finally coming, and Eddie

must rush. Eddie pulls out

THE BROILER - CLOSE

Taped to the inside is A LARGE BROWN PADDED ENVELOPE.

Slowly, Eddie pulls out the package, reaches into it.

EDDIE'S HANDS - CLOSE

He is holding about TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in cash. But

that's not all. He reaches in again... there's something else

inside... Eddie's hand pulls out a LITTLE BLACK ADDRESS BOOK.

But there's still something else.. he reaches in again. And

now Eddie's hand pulls out A PLASTIC CONTAINER WITH AN AIR-

LOCK SEAL... he pries the seal off... Inside are FIVE HUNDRED

OF THE LITTLE WHITE PILLS.

Eddie HEARS THE THUD OF APPROACHING FEET, voices. Making a

decision, he quickly tucks the envelope into his jacket,

jumps down from the chair... JUST AS A COP pushes through the

door.

He sees Eddie, spins, POINTS HIS GUN right at him.

Eddie throws his arms in the air.

INT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

Eddie sits, making his statement to an overweight DETECTIVE.

The Detective looks at him suspiciously.

CLOSE ON THE ENVELOPE hidden in his jacket, burning a hole in

his side. Eddie tries to stay calm.

The phone is ringing. The detective picks it up.

Mysteriously, the Detective hands the phone to Eddie.

FLASH!

EXT. A BEACH - DAY

Eddie sees young, beautiful Melissa, laughing, in the surf.

INT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

Eddie can't believe it. He stares at the phone, then finally

speaks into it.

A beat. Eddie still can't believe he's talking to her.

He lets it hang in the air for a moment.

A beat. Melissa's voice is wan, vulnerable.

She's hung up. Gone. Eddie turns back to the detective who's

staring intently at him.

Eddie tries not to look panicked. The cop looks up, taking in

the entrance of THREE newly arrested HIGH CLASS HOOKERS.

They are young. They are blond. They are wearing very short

skirts and fuck-me heels. The cop eyes them appreciatively.

EXT. PRECINCT - DAY

Eddie walks down the stairs, shaken up but profoundly

relieved. Even a little giddy. Then he stops.

EXT. THE STREET - DAY

Eddie walks, trying to cast inconspicuous glances over his

shoulder.

EDDIE'S POV - THE STREET

Is this guy following him? That guy? They all look innocuous.

They all look threatening. He has no idea.

INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Eddie enters, and, casting a surreptitious look around,

closes the door behind him.

INT. EDDIE'S DINING TABLE - DAY

The cash, the address book, and the bottle of pills are all

laid out on the table. Eddie sits, looking at them, realizing

that his life is now about to be jump-started. Yeah. Worth

the risk. A smile twitches at the corner of his mouth.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

Eddie is walking down the street, a brisk confidence in his

step, that penetrating gleam of intelligence back in his

eyes. We know right away that he's on MDT.

INT. A HIP DOWNTOWN MENS STORE - DAY

Eddie is being fitted for a sharp looking jacket. The camera

moves to the mirror and we are suddenly (CONTINUOUS SHOT) in--

INT. TRENDY DOWNTOWN SALON - DAY

A hip, pretty girl is giving Eddie a haircut.

THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN... but instead of finding him the

chair we are...

INT. GYM - DAY

Eddie's doing crunches, getting in shape.

THE CAMERA PANS to the mirror... but sees a reflection of...

INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

He sits at his computer, a salad beside him. His printer

spits out page after page of manuscript.

INT. MARK SUTTON'S OFFICE - DAY

Eddie puts down a thicker manila envelope on Mark's desk.

Mark is astonished.

INT. A SUGAR BOWL ON EDDIE'S TABLE - DAY

It contains ten tablets of MDT. Eddie's fingers reach in,

take one.

INT. THE MET - DAY

Eddie surveys paintings.

INT. A PIANO CONCERT - DAY

Eddie sits attentively in the audience, reading the score

along with the music.

INT. THE EAST RIVER - DAY

Eddie runs, earphones on his head. We HEAR, dimly, French

phrases.

Eddie becomes aware that there's ANOTHER RUNNER --a powerful-

looking man, gaining on him, closer behind than makes him

comfortable. Eddie flicks a glance over his shoulder.

With a surge of effort, Eddie speeds up, sprinting across the

street just after the light changes. WHIZZING TRAFFIC cuts

the mysterious runner off, stops him from following. He

remains, panting, at the light.

INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY - (SERIES OF SHOTS)

CLOSE ON: the plastic baggie of pills being DUCT TAPED inside

the top of EDDIE'S BROILER. He SLAMS the broiler closed.

INT. A BAR - NIGHT

Eddie stands there, in his new clothes, holding court. He has

an entirely new aura. It's commanding.

He banters flirtatiously with a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

She breaks off, shrugs, smiles.

He puts a finger under her chin. He means her face, of

course. The woman smiles, and blushes.

INT. UPSCALE BAR BATHROOM - (UNISEX, FOR ONE PERSON) NIGHT

TIGHT SHOT (LEGS ONLY) OF this regal, upscale women's panties

down around her high heels and Eddie's legs between hers,

pumping. A VASE shatters to the floor beside their feet,

spilling its pricey orchids.

INT. ANOTHER BAR - ANOTHER NIGHT

The CAMERA circles around a European-looking crowd... that's

clustered around Eddie. He's finishing a long story -in

French.

INT. A MODEST QUEENS LIVING ROOM - DAY

Eddie's MOTHER and FATHER, working class schlubs, sit on the

floral sofa, staring at their now-dapper son, who is waving

some paperwork in their faces.

His parents stare at him. They don't know what to make of any

of this.

INT. ANOTHER UPSCALE BAR - NIGHT

A sizable crowd is around Eddie, including finance types in

suits.

A well-dressed broker - KEVIN DOYLE - shakes his head.

Eddie's tone isn't aggressive -- it's genial, amusing.

The crowd laughs. Eddie takes a swallow of his drink.

Eddie toasts him.

Kevin Doyle, wishing Eddie was right, clinks his glass.

EXT. THE BAR - NIGHT

Eddie leaves with several people. Kevin Doyle presses a card

into Eddie's hand.

Eddie politely takes his card. Smiles charmingly.

INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Eddie pulls out the broiler and removes the ENVELOPE OF CASH

he's taped in there. It's much thinner.

INT. MARK SUTTON'S OFFICE - DAY

Eddie stands opposite Mark's desk.

Another ELEGANT MAN is there too, Mark's boss, DUNHAM.

Eddie smiles coolly. In control. It's Mark who's a little

nervous.

Eddie holds there gaze, expressionless, but says nothing.

After an uncomfortable moment, Dunham continues.

Eddie sounds almost regretful.

Sutton thinks Eddie's kidding. He laughs nervously.

Dunham realizes he's losing Eddie, and jumps in.

The mens' mouths open. Then shut.

INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Financial reading material covers every square inch of floor.

Eddie now has three monitors operating side-by-side in his

living room, all spewing forth financial information as he

works the keyboard...

INT. AT A COMPUTER (LAFAYETTE TRADING FIRM) - DAY

Eddie stands behind a DAY TRADER who's spewing out an

explanation of his work.

Eddie is staring at the screen, blocks of information forming

and connecting in his mind.

INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Eddie now sits, riveted to his laptop, keying.

Eddie, differently dressed, surrounded by stacks of research,

again keying away...

INT. A COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Eddie sits across from a sinister-looking young Russian in

his early 30's. This is GENNADY.

The two men stare at each other.

Gennady barely glances at the papers Eddie pushes in front of

him and snorts, half amused, before pushing them back.

Eddie now sees that it's better not to admit that he came by

the money legally.

Gennady smiles.

Gennady laughs for a second. Eddie's not wrong about that.

Gennady looks in Eddie's eyes for a moment, calculating.

Gennady just looks at Eddie, thinking it over.

INT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY

Eddie sits on a bench, waiting. Gennady appears. Hands Eddie

a large paper bag. Eddie reaches for it; Gennady holds it

aloft for one last second.

He lets the full picture sink in for a moment. Then:

INT. LAFAYETTE TRADING - DAY

Cubicle after cubicle of GUYS - all guys - at computers,

rolling the dice on the stockmarket.

Eddie alone in a stall. He takes TWO MDT TABLETS out of his

wallet, downs them.

OVERLAPPING DISSOLVES of Eddie working at a furious pace.

Another trader stands behind Eddie, watching. Second shot:

three traders are watching. Third shot: nine traders are

watching him, awed.

The trader shakes his head. How did Eddie know that?

INT. LAFAYTTE DAY TRADING - OVERHEAD SHOT OF ROOM -- "GOD

As still more people drift over to where Eddie is sitting...

EDDIE - CLOSE

Eyes taking in data, fingers reacting on the keyboard...

INT. LAFAYETTE DAY TRADING BUILDING - DAY

Eddie at the computer, soaking up information, making trades.

Kevin Doyle stands behind Eddie, flabbergasted as he watches.

INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK

Quick cuts of Eddie playing back his messages:

Eddie makes a jerk-off motion, crosses to his window, looks

down.

EXT. EDDIE'S POV - HIS STREET - DUSK

There is a MYSTERIOUS BLACK CAR just sitting at the curb, in

front of his building. No one gets in or out. Eddie turns

back to his machine.

INT. A FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Lindy, Eddie's ex-girlfriend, is sitting across the table

from Eddie. She peers at him, confused. Is this dapper

stranger really her shlumpy ex?

She is pleased for him, but flabbergasted.

THE BEAUTIFUL HOSTESS appears at Eddie's side. They have a

brief conversation in Italian. Lindy stares, confused, as the

hostess leaves.

Lindy eyes him, half pleased, half apprehensive. He seems so

different.

Lindy looks away, blushes. Sighs.

Eddie waits for her words, happily expectant.

They smile at each other. A lot of affection flooding back.

INT. LINDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Eddie is making out with her on her couch.

INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

His apartment has been seriously transformed. Of course, it's

nothing but a renovated tenement, but there are some new

furnishings, rugs, lighting-- the total effect is now one of

stylish prosperity. She and Eddie sit on the rug in front of

the coffee table, drinking expensive wine.

INT. THE BACK SEAT OF A CAB - NIGHT

Eddie and Lindy, dressed to the nines, are clearly returning

from a fancy party... and passionately entwined, at the point

of having hot sex, driver or no driver!

INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eddie stands, naked, at the window, looking out.

He walks back over to her, looks down. She is snuggled up in

Eddie's pillow, looking very pretty and vulnerable.

He's lying. He's not sure.

He looks back at her, eyes unreadable. He shrugs.

Eddie nods, sighs, turns away from the window. Then stops. He

turns pale. Is sweating.

Eddie takes a step. And suddenly... He's across the room.

Boom. A skip in time.

He puts his hand on a table, steadies himself. He catches a

look, in the mirror, of this lean, handsome, dapper shark he

has become.

He doesn't look all right.

Dully the realization penetrates Eddie's fog:

INT. THE ORPHEUS ROOM - NIGHT

Eddie sits at a table, discreetly wolfing a few appetizers.

Kevin Doyle arrives, looking a little nervous.

He sits, launches in.

There is so much quiet authority in Eddie's tone that Kevin

just shuts up. But a moment later, looking at the sweat on

Eddie's brow, Kevin is pecking at him again.

Brazening it out again. Because Eddie isn't sure he can pull

this off either.

ACROSS THE ROOM - LATER

There is that little stir from the hostess and staff that can

only mean the entrance of a very rich and powerful man.

EDDIE'S TABLE -LATER

The martini is put down on the table. We tilt up to CARL VAN

LOON, a young 50, no less vital and intense than the

hungriest 27-year-old shark on the make. But he affects

geniality. He sits; the middle-aged man with him, PIERCE,

does the same.

He looks Eddie directly in the eyes.

A beat. Eddie looks at him back, directly in the eyes.

Another beat. And Van Loon laughs. Pierce doesn't.

ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER - THAT NIGHT

Eddie is in mid-spiel, Van Loon listening intently.

Kevin sucks in his breath. Pierce is annoyed. Van Loon is

mildly amused, but not necessarily impressed. Eddie

continues with his unstoppable, MDT-fueled insights:

A beat, as we PUSH IN on Eddie's face.

Kevin stares in horror. Van Loon still says nothing.

EXT. THE ORPHEUS ROOM - NIGHT

Eddie simply stands there coolly; Kevin is nervously saying

goodbye to Van Loon and Pierce, making small talk.

Kevin blubbers with gratitude. Van Loon's car pulls up. Kevin

pumps his hand. Van Loon looks past Kevin -- to Eddie.

It's the first real acknowledgement that he's taken Eddie

seriously.

INT. VAN LOON'S LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

Eddie and Van Loon regard each other. Finally, Van Loon

speaks.

He picks up a file, hands it to Eddie.

EXT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Van Loon's limo pulls up.

INT. VAN LOON'S LIMO - NIGHT

Eddie snaps the file shut, hands Van Loon back his pen

flashlight.

Van Loon's gaze is expressionless.

He eyes Van Loon, who is sitting up straighter. Eddie's hit

a nerve. He smiels, whistles.

A flicker in Van Loon's eyes. Bullseye.

He says it like it's the simplest thing in the world. Which,

to a person on MDT, it is.

Van Loon grinds his teeth. Wanting to talk about it, but too

skittish.

A long beat.

A beat as the two men stare at each other.

Now Van Loon chuckles, amused by Eddie's audacity.

Eddie suddenly pulls back the bait.

Van Loon laughs.

Eddie nods.

Eddie opens the car door. Van Loon eyes his building, scoffs.

Eddie smiles.

He gets out. Van Loon drives off.

EXT. EDDIE'S BLOCK - NIGHT

Eddie keeps walking by his building.

His stride picks up, buoyantly.

He steps off the curb.

A SHARP, JARRING

EXT. HOUSTON STREET - NIGHT

Eddie is stepping off another curb, God knows where.

He stops, rocked.

ON EDDIE WALKING...

...in mid-step...

EXT. UPPER 5TH AVENUE - NIGHT

Eddie is walking past the Metropolitan Museum.

A SHARP, JARRING CUT TO:

INT. A CLUB - NIGHT

Eddie is suddenly sitting at a bar, picking up a drink,

people around him...

A SHARP, JARRING CUT TO:

Eddie is dancing with a BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMAN...

He breaks away from her, starts for the door...

A SHARP, JARRING CUT TO:

INT. A CLUB LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

Eddie comes to in the act of banging THE BEAUTIFUL BLACK

WOMAN savagely, against the stall door.

A SHARP, JARRING CUT TO:

EXT. HARLEM STREET IN FRONT OF BAR

Bam! A LARGE BLACK MAN crumples in front of Eddie -- goes

down, hit, blood pouring from his nose. (Could he be the

boyfriend of the girl Eddie's just banged?) Eddie stares at

his bloody fist. It hurts--!

INT. A LOFT - NIGHT

Eddie sits on a plush sofa with several MIDDLE-AGED

INTERNATIONAL TYPES, some chattering in Italian.

He has a drink in his hand. There are paintbrushes, paints

and canvasses strewn around... a live/work space.

A SHARP, JARRING CUT TO:

(And now the images are speeding up:)

INT. A HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Eddie is walking down the plush corridor with an ATTRACTIVE

MIDDLE-AGED LATIN WOMAN we saw at the artist's loft... Now

it's just FLASHES --skimming stones of consciousness-A WINE

CORK being popped. A PLATE OF MUSSELS swimming in wine sauce.

Rumpled SHEETS. And then...A BLUR OF MOTION -- bodies, a

swirl of riotous color --

A FRENZY OF SHOTS: A CAB STOPPING. A GARGOYLE ON A BUILDING.

A DOG LEASH ABANDONED IN A PUDDLE. No rhyme, no reason, just

image, image, image...

And then blackness.

EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAWN

Eddie is walking, now with a limp. He stops. Looks back. The

familiar postcard view of Manhattan is ahead of him, looking

like it always looks.

He notices his foot hurts when he puts it down. He has a

limp.

He turns around and limps back towards the island.

INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Eddie is sleeping in all his clothes.

INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Eddie, looking very groggy, is holding a THICK PACKET marked

"Van Loon Associates, -BY COURIER." The files Carl Van Loon

sent. Sitting on the dining table is an MDT tablets. He

stares at them.

He pushes the tablets away. Doesn't take them.

ANOTHER ANGLE - TIME CUT

Eddie is sitting in his reading chair, exhausted, going

through the paperwork.

VAN LOON'S FILES - CLOSE

Eddie leafs through them... pieces of paper charting

corporate growth, covered with charts, graphs, and mind-

numbing statistics. PUSH IN ON Eddie's face, as he

realizes...

INT. A WALL STREET OFFICE - DAY

The phone rings. Kevin Doyle picks it up.

And we CROSS-CUT between them:

It's a lame excuse, it sounds lame as he says it, but then,

he's off MDT.

We see the two men continue to talk, Kevin growing more

agitated, Eddie growing more sheepish as we HEAR:

We FADE UP THE SOUND on the two men:

Eddie looks pretty bad. He massages his temples.

He hands up on a still-yammering Doyle. He picks up the MDT

pill, looks at it.

Again, he looks at the MDT tablet, weighing his options.

He puts the tablet back down on the table.

INT. THE REGENCY HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

Eddie walks in, much more tentative in his stride, fear in

his eyes. This is the real Eddie, the non-MDT Eddie and he

feels suddenly out of place with the curly maple paneling

antique Persian carpets.

INT. BAR AREA - DAY

Eddie sits on a couch, Pierce on another chair, Van Loon

opposite, watching him.

He's struggling.

He shoots Eddie a look of withering contempt. Eddie holds the

stare and shoots a look back.

A flash of panic in Eddie's eyes. What's the right answer?

An agonizing pause. Then Van Loon nods.

Eddie is faking it. Pierce is looking at him intently. But

Eddie's staying afloat.

Eddie's glance flicks to the TV behind the bar. A WOMAN'S

PICTURE flashes on the TV screen -- and he recognizes it.

It's the ITALIAN WOMAN he met last night!

Eddie strains to hear the ANCHORWOMAN'S VOICE...

Eddie tries to keep his face immobile. Van Loon's voice

drones on, distorted now, as we HEAR Eddie's heart pounding.

Eddie bolts upright.

Eddie is pale, sweaty, faint. There's only one thing to do:

Eddie dashes out. Van Loon and Pierce look at each other.

EXT. THE REGENCY - NIGHT

Eddie bursts from the door, VOMITS into the gutter.

He leans against a street sign, trying to right himself. He

gasps for breath.

INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Eddie comes in, breathing wildly, panicked.

Immediately the PHONE RINGS. He nearly jumps out of his skin.

He can't answer. He sits on the couch, head in his hands,

rocking, as it rings. Finally, the machine picks up.

Eddie lunges for the phone, picks it up.

But she's already hung up.

CLOSE ON - EDDIE'S DRESSER DRAWER - DAY

Eddie's hands rummage through everything...

His hands find what they're looking for. Vernon's LITTLE

BLACK BOOK.

INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Eddie sits on the bed, the black book open on his knees.

Eddie looks at the page, then reaches for the telephone.

Picks it up. Hears STRANGE CLICKS over the dial tone.

He puts down the phone, fear on his face.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

Eddie walks, slipping through the crowd, trying to suppress

his limp... he looks nervously behind him... is that MAN in

the TAN RAINCOAT following him? He tries to walk faster, but

it makes his limp more pronounced. He turns the corner. He

seems to have lost the guy.

EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY

Eddie sits on a park bench, making calls on his cell phone.

Eddie is floored.

Eddie has dialled another number.

Eddie turns to the last page of Vernon's book.

Eddie dials the last number. Instantly, there is a RING. We

RACK FOCUS TO-The MAN in the TAN COAT, sitting a discreet

distance from Eddie. His phone is ringing. Eddie turns white.

The man takes out his cell phone and answers.

The man suddenly looks up. Locks eyes with Eddie. Knows that

he knows. Eddie leaps up, begins to run. The man leaps up and

follows.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

Eddie runs desperately, as fast as a person off MDT possibly

can.

He still has the limp from his blackout escapade, too. He

can't run fast.

Tan Coat is gaining. Eddie collides with pedestrians, steps

on street sunglass displays, sends a saxophonist sprawling.

Eddie, panicked, not looking, runs for the crosswalk.

EDDIE'S POV - A HUGE TRUCK

is barrelling, unstoppably, right towards him--!

EDDIE is frozen. The TRUCK SWERVES, up on the curb. Tan Coat

must dive out of the way, knocking down pedestrians like

bowling pins, as the TRUCK hits a STREETLIGHT, mangling it --

then is WHACKED -- twice -- by TWO CABS piling up behind it.

When Tan Coat extracts himself from the pile of prone

pedestrians, his last glimpse is of-

EDDIE - DOWN THE BLOCK

disappearing down into a Subway entrance. Swallowed by a

crowd.

hesitates, but knows that he can't catch up. Eddie's given

him the slip. This time.

INT. CHARLIE'S COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Eddie, limping, enters, looking around anxiously.

EDDIE'S POV - SCANNING THE PLACE

Not one person in it could possibly be Melissa. Eddie sighs.

Turns to go.

Eddie turns back. There, sitting at a booth, is a thick-

waisted, short-haired brunette middle-aged woman, wearing a

large, shapeless sweater. Eddie had looked right at her...

and not recognized her. She bears no relationship to the

siren Melissa of his memories. Eddie tries to hide the shock

on his face.

He goes to her, sits. Yes, it's the same person, but

dramatically, tragically changed. Her face is puffy, her

pallor blotchy. There are lines under her eyes and around her

mouth, lines brought on by more than the passage of a few

years.

Eddie tries to conceal his shock.

Melissa responds with a cynical shrug. Then, she eyes him.

They regard each other for minute, unsure of where to start.

Old emotions. New emotions. Shock. Dismay. Affection.

Eddie doesn't know what to say.

Melissa snorts as if to say, typical.

A long beat as they look into each other's eyes.

Eddie hates the look in her eyes. His hands are at his

temples.

She leans back, looks him in the eyes.

Eddie feels ill, physically ill, hearing this.

She gets up... goes to the Ladies room. And now Eddie sees --

she wears a LEG BRACE. Like a kid, from the old days, with

Polio.

We see FLASHES OF YOUNG MELISSA...

The tears gather behind Eddie's eyes. He can't help it. He

puts his hand to his face to hide his emotions.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Eddie leaves with Melissa. He is controlling his tears --

barely.

Eddie, indeed, is rubbing his temples.

Eddie catches her arm.

He lets go of her arm. A puffy, crippled woman about to cry.

She turns her back and moves away from him, stiffly, limping,

without looking back.

EXT. EDDIE'S POV - HIS APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

He glances around - the coast is clear - and sets off across

the street. He looks weak, ill - his breathing labored. He

stumbles - catches himself

He pulls it from his pocket.

WHAM! He's pushed up against the wall of his building. Not

by Tan Coat.

By GENNADY THE RUSSIAN.

Eddie is stunned -- Gennady whacked his head against the

building pretty hard. He still clutches the MDT tablet tight

in his fist.

INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - ON THE DOOR

They come into his apartment, Eddie using all his energy to

stay upright.

Gennady turns to ice.

Eddie realizes his brain isn't working --of course Gennady

can't take a check.

Gennady has punched him in the stomach. Harder than he's ever

been punched. Eddie gasps for breath... holds his fist to his

body, protecting the pill. Gennady notices.

Gennady grabs Eddie's wrist and wrenches his hand open.

Gennady snatches the pill away from him. Examines it.

His voice drips with crude contempt.

In one swift motion, Gennady pops it in his mouth and

swallows it!

Eddie is mute with shock.

INT. A BANK - CLOSE ON

Eddie's shaking hands are handing Gennady a thick envelope.

He looks desperately ill. He can barely stand. Gennady,

meanwhile, is coming on to MDT.

He wants to hit Eddie again, but thinks the better of it with

all the bank cameras.

THE MONITOR -

We see Gennady give the camera a gay little wave, then turn

and walk out.

EXT. THE STREET - DAY

Eddie lurches along the street, staggering like a drunk,

barely able to walk. People avoid him, veering away.

INT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY

Lindy clearly has a mid-level executive job; her office is

better than a cubicle and she has a bit of a view. There is a

KNOCK. A FEMALE ASSISTANT appears in the door.

EDDIE appears in the door, looking deathly ill.

The girl goes. Lindy, sensing something dire, leaps up and

closes the door.

Eddie immediately collapses on the floor. Lindy kneels down

to help him - competent, trying to stay calm.

Eddie's PHONE rings. He and Lindy look at each other. He

answers it.

INT. VALERIE (HIS LANDLADY'S) APARTMENT - DAY

Valerie is on the phone. And we CROSS-CUT BETWEEN THEM:

There are, indeed, LOUD NOISES coming from above her.

Understanding in Eddie's pained eyes. He clicks off the

phone.

INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT -A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS -DAY

MALE HANDS are ripping the place to pieces. Pulling the

toilet from the wall. Cutting open the mattress. Taking apart

Eddie's computer.

INT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY

INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The MALE HANDS have found Eddie's hiding place. They LIFT the

old BROILER of the STOVE... ...and...

The MDT IS NOT THERE. The broiler is slammed down in anger.

INT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY

He looks at her, guiltily.

INT. LINDY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Lindy enters. Tense, panicked. She walks to a SQUARE END

TABLE, takes the lamp off it. The table is actually a box --

she lifts the lid. She reaches in... and pulls out the PACKET

OF MDT.

Furious, she stuffs it into her purse and goes for the door.

EXT. LINDY'S BUILDING - DAY

As she leaves, we see that we are in the POV of...

across the street. He clicks open a CELL PHONE.

INT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY

There is a KNOCK on the DOOR. Lying on the floor, trying to

breathe, Eddie ignores it. His PHONE rings again. It takes a

lot of effort just to answer it.

And we CROSS-CUT BETWEEN:

INT. A MOVING CAB - DAY

Lindy is on the phone. Her voice is tense, terrified.

Eddie, helpless on the floor, can do nothing.

EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY

Lindy bolts from the cab just as TAN COAT puts his hand on

the opposite door. She takes off into Central Park. And he's

after her like a shot.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Lindy veers off the path, through the trees, zig-zagging,

trying to find a place not to be seen.

Zig-zags too, not far behind her.

Begins to scream, desperate:

Up ahead, miraculously, A COP ON HORSEBACK. He steps the

horse toward her. She races over and presses her body against

the side of the horse.

She's so panicked and out of breath she can barely speak.

The cop seems to be paying attention, then suddenly GRUNTS

and TWITCHES, his eyes flutter, glaze... and HE TOPPLES OFF

HIS HORSE to the ground... ...revealing TAN COAT, on the

other side of the horse. The BLADE in his hand is bloody.

LINDY runs.... tries to lose herself in a WEDDING PARTY...

comes to a section of huge, decorative BOULDERS and ROCKS.

Dives behind one of them.

Ahead, she can see the outdoor ICE SKATERS, couples,

families, enjoying the ice. It seems surreal. Several yards

behind her is TAN COAT, looking behind every tree, every

trash bin. Lindy picks up the phone, keeping her voice low,

although she's hyperventilating.

And we CROSS-CUT BETWEEN:

INT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY

Tan Coat is getting closer.

She swallows the pill.

A beat. We PUSH IN on Lindy's eyes. Which are changing.

Growing more steely. Determined.

She hangs up. Eddie is left looking at the phone.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Tan Coat is perhaps five yards behind Lindy and getting

closer. But she's not crying any more. She's looking at-THE

ICE SKATING RINK, and the skaters, whirling across the ice.

eyes flash. She knows what to do. Suddenly, she BOLTS from

her hiding place behind the rock, tearing down the hill as

fast as she can. Tan Coat is behind her like a shot.

EXT. THE ICE SKATING RINK - DAY

Lindy races down the hill, pushing past the line of people,

and onto the ice... Tan Coat is clearly desperate --he

doesn't give a shit who sees him chasing her.

In a flash, he's on the ice after Lindy, running and sliding.

People collide with him, he pushes skaters aside, sending

them sprawling... Just as he's closing in on Lindy...

Lindy wheels around, grabs a SIX YEAR OLD GIRL under the

arms, and HOISTS HER INTO THE AIR, swinging her legs at Tan

Coat as hard she can! The little girl's skates arc through

the air --whoosh! -and connect, CUTTING Tan Coat's FACE.

Badly.

He sinks to his knees, hand to his cheek, welling blood.

People scream and scatter. Lindy keeps her wits about her.

She runs, sliding across the ice, and leaping the fence, with

surprising grace. She's gone.

INT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY - ON EDDIE'S HAND - CLOSE

as an MDT pill is put into it. A WIDER SHOT shows Eddie

swallowing it with a glass of water.

sits across the room, looking at him, her expression cool and

composed.

They look at each other, a look of understanding.

INT. W HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY

Eddie finishes checking in, Lindy beside him. He seems

completely restored to his sharp, snappy self. The desk clerk

gives him a key. He puts his arm around her, leads her to the

elevators.

INT. W HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT

Eddie takes Lindy's hands, sits her on the bed.

He kisses her hands. Looks into her eyes.

Lindy looks at him for a long moment.

Lindy's head comes up. She looks at him, steely.

She gets up, turns away from him.

There's eerie quiet to her tone that Eddie hasn't heard

before. A matter-of-fact chill.

She heads for the door.

She goes. He knows there's no point in stopping her. She's

done with him.

EXT. W HOTEL - LATER

Eddie at the WINDOW, looking down...

EXT. EDDIE'S POV - THE STREET

He sees Lindy briskly walking away. RACK FOCUS as Lindy

passes... GENNADY. Leaning against a sign post. Lighting a

cigarette. And looking up at Eddie's hotel. Waiting.

EXT. W HOTEL - DAY

Gennady stands there, looking up at the hotel. So he's a

little surprised to find EDDIE walking right up to him.

Gennady quickly gets aggressive:

Something is jammed into Eddie's ribs. Something under

Gennady's coat. Eddie doesn't blink.

Gennady walks him around the corner, down some stairs, to the

(deserted) ground entrance of someone's apartment. Eddie

remains cool.

He whacks Eddie, hard, across the face. Eddie, stoic, on MDT,

doesn't react.

Now Gennady smiles.

Eddie doesn't like that Gennady knows anything about his

business life. But he stands his ground.

The gun barrel is brought up beneath Eddie's chin.

Gennady looks at him for a long, menacing moment.

But he's accepted the ten. For now. He PUSHES Eddie against

the wall, hard, knocking the wind out of him.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CLOSE ON - A SMALL ENVELOPE

being put into Gennady's hand. A wider shot reveals Eddie,

watching Gennady with contempt as he grabs a fistful of nuts

off a bar table as he goes. Pig.

INT. CARL VAN LOON'S OFFICE - DAY

Van Loon looks at Eddie penetratingly.

A long beat as the two men size each other up. Van Loon looks

away, but a tiny smile creases the corner of his mouth.

Eddie stays cool. He's in.

INT. VAN LOON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Eddie sits with Van Loon, Pierce, and several POWERFUL

LOOKING MEN, conferring. They look at an elaborate

chart/graph that Eddie is sketching... even Pierce, his

detractor, looks impressed.

INT. W HOTEL - NIGHT

Eddie is eating a luxurious room service dinner, going

through files and projections.

Eddie shakes one MDT pill into his hand, downs it.

INT. LAYFAYETTE DAY TRADING - DAY

Eddie is back on the trading floor, a crowd around him.

INT. A MADISON AVENUE TAILOR'S SHOP - DAY

Eddie is being fitted for new suits.

The Tailor nods, makes a note. He's certainly not going to

ask any questions.

INT. A WINDOWLESS ROOM - DAY

Eddie, buzzing with charismatic authority, speaks to TWO

BEEFY MEN, who are professional muscle. (Note: one has very

elaborate tattoos on his fingers.)

The men nod. They understand.

INT. EDDIE'S HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

Eddie straightens his tie. Then opens his suit jacket,

reaches in, and pulls along a seam. An invisible POCKET

OPENS.

INT. A LABORATORY - NIGHT

The place is state of the art, but it's an after-hours,

furtive meeting Eddie is having with a TECHNICIAN, who passes

back a small PLASTIC ENVELOPE to Eddie. In it we see SEVERAL

TABLETS of MDT.

Eddie tosses the envelope back at him, gets up.

He holds up the packet. The guy considers. Then slowly

reaches for it, taking the MDT back.

INT . RESTAURANT - DAY

Eddie is having lunch with several POWER PLAYERS. They are

listening, mesmerized, to what Eddie is saying...

His eyes flicker upwards. His two SECURITY MEN are seated at

the bar. The CAMERA PANS to find... Also seated at the bar,

is the DETECTIVE who questioned Eddie at the police station!

Eddie gets up, "casually" wanders over to where the detective

is sitting, pretends to order another drink. He does not make

eye contact with the detective, or look like he's talking to

him.

Fear begins to prick the back of Eddie's neck. But he strives

for casual annoyance.

The DETECTIVE hands Eddie a magazine.

THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS - CLOSE

It is turned to the middle, and there is a picture of Eddie,

candid, on the trading floor. That fucking article!

Eddie keeps his cool, does not look scared. Wanders back to

the table, says a few cool words, and strolls back to the

detective. The detective gets up. Shall we go?

EXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

Eddie walks down the steps, with a beautifully dressed shark

lawyer, MORRIS BRANDT, 50's.

Eddie's two SECURITY GUYS, waiting, fall into step ten paces

behind him.

He's heard it all, and doesn't really care.

INT. CARL VAN LOON'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Eddie is making a presentation to the Van Loon Associates --

and a skeptical-looking OLDER GUY -- HANK ATWOOD.

Atwood rubs his temples, seemingly distracted. But then, he

looks at Eddie piercingly.

INT. VAN LOON'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

The meeting has broken up. Atwood is leaving, surrounded by

minions. Van Loon leans into Eddie.

Van Loon notices -- Atwood is using a cane.

Atwood's gone. Van Loon looks at Eddie.

Van Loon eyes him. Eddie is only half kidding.

Eddie returns Van Loon's look coolly, implying that it really

might be in Van Loon's best interest to trust him.

Both he and Eddie start to laugh.

He tries to read Eddie's smile which is removed, far away...

Eddie opens his mouth. Pauses.

Van Loon didn't get to where he is for nothing.

He shakes Eddie's hand.

INT. A HUGE, DELUXE EMPTY APARTMENT - (THE CELESTIAL) - DAY

Eddie is being shown the apartment by a thirty-something

female REALTOR. The apartment is still under construction --

brand new -- and enormous, with a wall of floor-to-ceiling

windows in the living room showing off spectacular views.

Eddie looks out over the city, feeling a surge. Yes.

Eddie has to look away from her, biting his lip. He can't

show her any sign of sticker shock. The face he turns back to

her is composed, even blase. He shrugs -- no problem!

We see an almost sexual excitement dance in her eyes.

INT. EDDIE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Eddie comes in. The room has been completely ripped to pieces

-- just like Eddie's apartment. Eddie just smiles. Because

there was nothing for anyone to find.

EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY

Eddie stands, waiting, his two security guys lurking 10 steps

behind. GENNADY appears, now with TWO RUSSIAN THUGS of his

own. This is new, and Eddie wasn't expecting it.

Gennady's security guys eye Eddie's security guys, and vice

versa. Gennady is wearing a suit and looks much more

sophisticated. Eddie hands Gennady a small envelope. Gennady

takes it. In his eyes is a penetrating intelligence.

Gennady whips out a silver lighter and lights himself a

cigarette. His movements are elegant, refined.

Gennady's eyebrow goes up. Gennady's security guys reach into

their jackets. So do Eddie's guys. Gennady's eyes flick over

the situation, motion to his guys to keep still. Gennady

laughs, an unpleasant sound.

Gennady turns with a flourish and walks off. Over his

shoulder, with smug confidence:

Gennady turns, walks to the curb, where a NEW BLACK TOWN CAR

is waiting for him and his boys.

INT. VAN LOON'S OFFICE - DAY

Eddie, Van Loon and associates are all waiting in the

conference room. The clock on the wall reads 9:40. Van Loon

looks glum. A long silence.

Van Loon pushes the intercom.

Eddie and Van Loon look at each other. What? Van Loon nods at

Eddie; the two men get up. Pierce starts to get up too.

Pierce looks bitter -- chastened -- as Van Loon and Eddie go.

INT. CARL VAN LOON'S INNER OFFICE - DAY

Van Loon and Eddie enter, to find MRS. HANK ATWOOD, a well-

dressed, well-preserved and beautiful 50, standing at Van

Loon's desk.

Van Loon and Eddie can't imagine what's coming next.

She speaks with great dignity, distraught, but tightly

controlled.

EXT. VAN LOON'S BUILDING - DAY

Eddie and Van Loon flank Mrs. Atwood, walking her to her car.

She shakes both of their hands. A driver has the door open

for her; she gets in, now out of earshot.

Eddie shakes his head. The two men look at each other darkly.

The driver closes her door, turns -- and now Eddie can see

his face. It's TAN COAT.

With a huge, angry scar slashed across his cheek. Eddie and

Tan Coat look at each other. A steely moment of recognition.

Tan Coat turns away, gets in the driver's side. Van Loon

watches the car pull away.

We PUSH IN on Eddie's face. Who now knows.

EXT. MIDTOWN STREET - DAY

Eddie, beautifully dressed, walks. Ten paces behind walk his

SECURITY GUYS. He is thinking.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY - CORRIDOR

Eddie stands with his favorite POLICE DETECTIVE and his

lawyer in an anteroom leading to an institutional door. His

lawyer talks to him, low.

A FEMALE COP approaches Eddie.

Eddie stiffens.

A beat.

Another beat of hesitation... then Eddie hands Brandt his

jacket, takes off his shirt, puts on the blue shirt... and

stoically follows the female cop through the grubby door.

INT. THE LINEUP - EDDIE'S FACE

FEMALE COP'S VOICE

Please turn to the right. Eddie and four other dark-haired

guys turn to the right. Eddie looks at the black one-way

window.

INT. POLICE STATION - ON EDDIE'S SMILING LAWYER

Eddie blinks at him.

He hands Eddie back his jacket.

Eddie just nods, his eyes steely. The lawyer feels the molten

stare and hands the jacket back.

EXT. POLICE STATION - DUSK

Eddie rushes down the steps, two at a time, looks at his

watch.

INT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DUSK

Gennady, wearing a gorgeous cashmere coat, waits, now with

THREE SECURITY GUYS.

Gennady looks at his watch, then says something low and

sinister in Russian to his associates.

INT. VAN LOON'S OFFICE - DUSK

Eddie hurries into the room. Van Loon doesn't look up. He's

watching a monitor, which has a live news feed to a financial

channel.

Van Loon turns to Eddie, furious, agitated.

Black looks between them as the newscaster continues.

He shoots Van Loon a glance. Van Loon is miserably fixated on

the TV.

INT. VAN LOON'S HUGE, SLEEK BATHROOM - DUSK

Eddie stands in a stall. Reaches into the lining of his coat.

Unfastens the opening of the compartment.

CLOSE ON THE OPENING

There is nothing inside.

EDDIE,

panicked, feels again. Nothing. The MDT is simply not

there!!! He begins to hyperventilate. Spin in place. Push

against the stall walls, trying not to scream.

He bursts from the stall, alone in the bathroom. Stares at

himself, terrified, in the mirror.

INT. VAN LOON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Eddie bursts from the bathroom. Trying not to look too wild-

eyed.

Eddie looks at a LARGE BOX on Van Loon's desk. Indeed, his

name is on it. Eddie, mystified, approaches it. As Van Loon

continues to stare at the TV, disinterested in the box, Eddie

gingerly opens it.

INT. THE BOX - CLOSE

Inside are the SEVERED HANDS OF EDDIE'S SECURITY GUYS. (One

black hand, one with the distinctive tattoos.) Gennady.

Clearly these guys are dead. Eddie grabs the box and starts

from the room.

But Eddie's gone.

INT. VAN LOON ASSOCIATES - DUSK

People are leaving for the night. Eddie shoves past them,

still holding the damning box, frightened, jacked up,

desperate, shoving people out of the way to get to the

elevators.

INT. A LIMO - NIGHT - MOVING

Eddie sits in the back seat, the box freakishly sitting

beside him.

ON EDDIE'S FACE

His brow is beaded with sweat.

PUSH IN on Eddie's eyes.

We begin to REWIND... in Eddie's mind... through many IMAGES

we've seen in this movie... stopping briefly at all the

places Eddie has stashed his MDT.

We STOP at the END TABLE in Lindy's apartment, peer inside.

Empty. We STOP at the UNDERSIDE of the GRILL on Eddie's old

stove. Nothing. We continue to REWIND -- but every image we

stop on reveals... nothing.

INT. THE CELESTIAL - EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Eddie sits at his huge new steel dining table, the evil box

on the table in front of him, head in his hands.

(The room is filled with labeled boxes he has never had a

chance to unpack.) The TV is on in the background. It's a

financial channel. We see MRS. HANK ATWOOD is giving a

statement.

She motions at the gentleman next to her. --Who is also

Eddie's attorney, MORRIS BRANDT. The one who was so helpful

with the police. The one who held his jacket.

Bitter amusement in Eddie's eyes. At least he knows. The

APARTMENT BUZZER buzzes. Eddie freezes. Looks at the door. It

BUZZES again.

Eddie walks to his phone, picks it up. Pushes the button,

puts it to his ear. It's dead.

He pushes the "on" button again and again. Nothing. The

buzzer BUZZES again. Eddie rushes to the door, opens the COAT

CLOSET. In the closet is a state-of-the-art SECURITY MONITOR.

Gennady and TWO MEN are outside his door! Suddenly the

MONITOR goes BLACK. Eddie flicks the switch on the monitor.

Nothing. Eddie flicks the switch again. It's dead. Someone,

somewhere, has figured out how to disarm it.

The buzzer BUZZES again. Eddie backs away from the door. We

HEAR Eddie's shallow, panicked breathing. He lunges for his

briefcase, pulls out his CELL PHONE.

THE CELL PHONE - CLOSE

It reads "No Signal." BAM! The first slam on the door begins.

BAM! The second. The door holds, but Eddie begins to back

away in horror.

BAM!

We slowly FADE TO BLACK. And FADE IN ON:

EXT. THE CELESTIAL - EDDIE'S TERRACE LEDGE - NIGHT

And now we pick up Eddie where we left him, standing on the

ledge.

We now hear the ZZZZZZZZ! of some major power tool drilling

at the door, punctuated by more BAMS! -- one way or another

they're going to get in. Eddie takes a breath, tries to jump.

He can't.

We PUSH IN on Eddie's eyes... We are still REWINDING in

Eddie's mind... images of where we've seen him keep MDT...

nothing... nothing... nothing... We STOP at the SUGARBOWL on

Eddie's dining table. Then go forward --no, wait!-rewinding,

stopping again on the SUGAR BOWL. Pushing in on the sugar

bowl.

Eddie spins around, looks back into his apartment, eyes

intense.

INT. THE CELESTIAL - EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Eddie is tearing through boxes as the POUNDING and DRILLING

become deafening... he rips open a box labeled "Kitchen" -

it's full of BOOKS. Mis-labeled. JUMP CUTS as he rips open

other boxes... his hands frantically scattering CDs, cutlery,

cans of food... The door begins to give. Under the deafening

MORE JUMP-CUTS as Eddie hysterically tears the packing paper

off of promisingly- shaped objects. --No. A glass. --No. A

vase. --YES! The sugar bowl. With sugar still inside! Eddie

rummages, frantically, among the sugar cubes as the door

gives a few inches, groaning, and we glimpse blurred faces on

the other side...

pokes, wildly, among the cubes... pushing them aside,

revealing at the bottom of the bowl-

ONE MDT TABLET looks back up at him.

Yes. It's really there! Eddie grabs it, just as, with a

splintering CRASH! -- The door goes down.

Eddie steps back, brings the pill up to his mouth... But as

he steps, he TRIPS on a SOUP CAN he's scattered... he FALLS

backwards... his HAND hits the side of the coffee table...

The MDT TABLET goes flying... (slow motion)... as... ...also

in slow motion, Gennady and his two thugs smile as they

advance into the room... THE MDT TABLET... flies... flies...

towards a GRATE in the floor -- a heating vent -- and HITS

it... rolling... ... before disappearing forever down the

grate.

Eddie knows that's it. His life has ended. He sucks in his

last breath -- then, with a YELL, he rushes back for the

terrace... for his suicide leap...

Thug #1 is quicker. Gets to the door first. Eddie will not

have the luck to be able to jump. He's trapped between the

two Thugs.

He reaches into his coat pocket...

...and pulls out a syringe.

He pulls the plastic sleeve off the needle. Jabs himself in

the arm and injects the cloudy liquid.

Eddie is backed to the wall. Nowhere to go.

Gennady just smiles -- that was an unfortunate choice. He

gives an order to the Thugs who grab their tools and

disappear deeper into the apartment. WE HEAR them starting to

tear things up. Gennady and Eddie are alone.

He clicks open a BLACK ATTACHE CASE. It is filled with

sinister-looking silver instruments, and knives.

INT. EDDIE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Thug #2 has found, behind a bureau, a SAFE. He calls

excitedly, in Russian, to the other room.

INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Gennady calls back in Russian. Then picks up a particularly

delicate, yet sharp-looking KNIFE.

Eddie is backed up against a table, which is covered with

stuff he's scattered, which includes a BUTCHER BLOCK with A

KNIFE in it... Gennady starts arranging his instruments.

He looks up, smiles, to see the effect his words have on

Eddie.

Staring back at Gennady, hard, a fuck-you stare. We can't see

behind Eddie's back, but we can see the butcher block, and

the knife is gone.

senses something is not right. Looks at Eddie quizzically.

Eddie brings the knife up as hard as he can, right into

Gennady's stomach. Gennady gasps in surprise, chokes,

writhes. Eddie drives the knife home, harder, grabbing

Gennady's other hand, which lashes at Eddie with the fillet

knife...

The men fall to the floor in a death-struggle. Eddie

exhausted, off MDT, but determined not to let go. Gennady

writhes, flails, but doesn't cry out... he's already choking

on blood. Eyes shocked, surprised. Eddie turns the fillet

knife back on Gennady, slashes at his other arm; blood

spurts. But it's not necessary. Gennady's eyes are glazing.

His gurgling gets quieter. He's quite dead.

Eddie lies alongside him, panting, arm grazed and welling

blood from where Gennady's filleting knife slashed him,

suddenly weak and exhausted.

From the other room comes the BRRRRRRR! sound of the drill --

the boys, oblivious, are hard at work on the safe. Eddie

tries to get up, then falls back.

He's got the shakes... no, more of a convulsion... he sinks

back to the floor...

There is a break in the convulsion. Then another one starts.

Gennady's BLOOD wells around Gennady's body in a crimson

puddle. A puddle that's creeping closer and closer to Eddie's

face, which is lying, convulsing, on the floor...

ON EDDIE'S EYES

between convulsions, suddenly looking. Looking at the blood.

It creeps closer to Eddie's face. Eddie is trying to move,

trying to push his face closer to the blood... he's there...

And now he turns his face down into the blood.

And begins to lap it up.

INT. EDDIE'S STUDY - DAY

The Thug finally gets the safe open. Inside is only one item -

-the TATTOOED SECURITY MAN's SEVERED HAND.

And its middle finger has been arranged in a vehement fuck-

you. The thugs are not amused.

INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

The thugs are coming down the hall, muttering angrily...

INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Mouth smeared with blood, Eddie is dragging himself by the

elbows, across the room. Footsteps coming. Fast.

INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - THUGS' POV

They burst into the room, see Gennady dead on the floor. The

camera WHIP-PANS around. No Eddie.

BEHIND THE COUCH

Eddie lies, panting. And then it hits. We PUSH IN on Eddie's

eyes. He feels it. His old friend. MDT.

look up at a NOISE. Just in time to see Eddie bolting out the

front door of the apartment.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EDDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

They come thundering out -- see a flash of Eddie disappearing

INT. THE OPEN DOOR OF THE APARTMENT NEXT DOOR - NIGHT

We are in jittery, handheld THUG'S POV shot as they burst

back in, barreling by rooms, looking in them, pressing on to

more rooms...

A MAN'S SHADOWY SHAPE AHEAD, IN THE KITCHEN -

Thug #2 BLASTS his GUN... the MAN crumples, the glass doors

behind him EXPLODE...... the MAN goes down...revealing Eddie

standing behind him --(he's been holding up his neighbor's

body) and, just as this registers -- WHACK! -- Eddie gives

THUG #1 a savage shot with a fireplace poker. Thug #1 goes

down, unconscious... the gun skitters across the floor...

THUG #2 dives, reaches for it. Eddie grabs a piece of the

shattered glass and, in a vicious swipe, brings it down on

the Thug's hand. But this guy is not a tough Russian

motherfucker for nothing. Bleeding profusely, he doesn't let

go of the gun... his bloody hand comes up, tries to aim...

Eddie DIVES BACKWARDS, through the broken glass door to the

patio. The thug stumbles after him...

EXT. EDDIE'S NEIGHBOR'S TERRACE - NIGHT

EDDIE'S HAND, still holding glass, CUTS the awning-rope

holding up the awning... The awning comes down on the thug, a

huge canvas curtain DROPPING between the Thug and Eddie.

BLAM! BLAM! Several holes appear in the canvas as the thug

tries to shoot Eddie anyway, but Eddie has leapt out of the

way.

THUG'S POV - UNDER THE CURTAIN

As he wrestles it off... he sees Eddie, on the ground, prone,

just watching him calmly. He starts to smirk. Eddie touches a

MATCH to the ground. The FLAME shoots across the floor to the

thug, who now realizes he's standing in a puddle, the

overturned can of BBQ fluid next to him. In an instant, his

LEGS AND PANTS are on fire. Now the man screams. Shoots

blindly. But - click! -- is out of bullets. He rushes at

Eddie, screaming, on fire, in animal rage. Eddie brings up a

wrought-iron patio chair to meet him, catching him squarely

in the ribs. He gasps, bends over... looks up at Eddie,

beaten...

The face that looks back is without pity.

EXT. THE CELESTIAL - 20 STORIES BELOW, A WIDER TERRACE - DAY

We are looking up at the penthouse. A SHAPE is dropping,

fast, towards us -- the shape of a man.

It's here! The man's head EXPLODES against the railing like a

pumpkin as the rest of him disappears down, out of sight.

INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

A MAN is on a gurney. A NURSE puts a sheet over his head.

Before our view of his face disappears we realize --it's Hank

Atwood. Dead.

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

Tan Coat is sitting, stoic and red-eyed in a chair. He senses

something. Slowly turns his head and looks.

EDDIE is sitting in the chair next to him. The two men look

at each other for a moment. Then:

Tan Coat stares at him, his face without expression.

INT. A CONNECTICUT UPPERCLASS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

AN UPPERCLASS HOUSEWIFE enters, in sweats, from the gym.

Immediately notices something is not right...

INT. THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The place has been ransacked.

INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

She rushes in. We SEE her husband - MORRIS BRANDT - tied up

and gagged, struggling on the floor. Next to him, a smashed

PICTURE. It once covered a WALL SAFE which is now open. The

SAFE is empty.

TITLE: Eight months later

INT. A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN OFFICE - DAY

Desks, employees, volunteers, ringing phones. REUBEN, LATE

20's, sharp, a JAMES CARVILLE-TYPE, sits on a desk with

casual authority, is on the phone.

We see Eddie striding down the corridor, wearing a sharp

suit, looking more dignified than we've ever seen him, more

adult. The snap and crackle of something new -- power -- is

in his step. TWO MALE AIDES flank him. Reuben approaches,

falls into step with them.

They have arrived at Eddie's office. Reuben nods at the

closed door.

Eddie sighs, capitulating. Puts his hand on the door.

Eddie shoots him a look.

INT. A LARGE, CASUAL OFFICE - DAY

Eddie comes in to find JOHN STEADMAN, 50's, well-dressed and

gentlemanly, waiting.

He shakes Steadman's hand, but Steadman doesn't get up. Odd.

In fact Steadman looks uncommonly relaxed, almost slouched in

his chair, looking up at Eddie with a subtle gleam in his eye

that Eddie doesn't recognize.

He says this with a kind of casual, prescient authority. And

suddenly, we know he's right. Eddie will win.

Again, that smile. Eddie doesn't know what this guy is

about. And nobody calls him "Eddie" any more.

Eddie blinks at him. Did he just say what Eddie thought he

said?

Eddie is now dead silent. A long beat. Is it possible? Is

he really talking to someone who makes MDT?!

Steadman just smiles, waves the question away.

Meaning, they took care of Vern.

A long beat. Eddie doesn't trust this guy -- not a bit.

Eddie takes that in.

Eddie knows now. They own his ass.

Steadman nods.

Steadman doesn't blink.

Steadman suddenly chuckles -- not at all concerned by this.

Even amused.

He heads for the door. Eddie remains still.

Steadman stops, looks back at him.

Steadman looks puzzled that Eddie would ask.

Eddie thinks. No, he doesn't.

EXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY

Eddie and Steadman exit, come down the steps, Eddie looking

thrown. He drifts along, half-a-step behind Steadman, deep

in thought.

Eddie doesn't answer.

A black LIMO waits at the curb.

They descend the last few steps. Steadman opens the limo

door for Eddie...

But Eddie hesitates. Doesn't get in.

Eddie gestures for him to get in.

He gets in. And Eddie CLOSES THE DOOR AFTER HIM. Stands

outside the limo, looking back at Steadman through the rolled-

down window, his face a cold mask.

Steadman looks at him quizically.

A flicker in Steadman's eyes. Anger.

Steadman raises his hand to the driver and the limo pulls

away.

As the limo recedes into the distance, Eddie finally exhales.

And only then do we see it.

He's scared.
