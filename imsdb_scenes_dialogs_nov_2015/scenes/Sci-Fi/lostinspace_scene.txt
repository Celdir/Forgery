CHAPTER 1: Earth 2058

---------------------

FADE IN ON:

EXT.-SPACE

PULL BACK slowly as MARS fills THE FRAME, a sphere of red desert and

fast rushing crimson clouds.

A triangular CARGO SHIP descends from the dark of space.

REVERSE ANGLE

EXT.-MARS

A row of giant red mountains and beneath, on the planet's surface, the

spires of A MINING BASE. Illuminated landing crosshairs alight a

landing pad, beckoning the ship.

EXT.-EDGE OF SPACE

THE CARGO SHIP changes attitude, landing thrusters FIRING as the

vessel begins to penetrate the atmosphere.

Amazing, what, we'll never know. The CARGO SHIP begins to EXPLODE, the

bubble bridge BLOWING out into space in a ball of fire.

EXT.- MARS

LOW ANGLE from the planet's surface-. Two shapes BLAST through FRAME,

BUBBLE FIGHTERS, single pilot, transparent globes, racing up towards

the sudden star of the cargo ship at impossible speed.

INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER

POV of the burning Cargo Ship, coming towards us incredibly fast.

Speed, trajectory and tactical readouts flash.

EXT.-CARGO SHIP

The pulse lasers are still hammering the ravaged hull.

WIDER

Two sinister ATTACK SHIPS, their lasers locked onto the Cargo Ship,

FIRE away as they BLAST overhead. The nuclear core of the Cargo Ship

overloads, the craft finally EXPLODING in a storm of fire.

A BUBBLE FIGHTER ROARS through the hurling world of flame. PUSH IN.

INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER

A lone FIGURE stands in a gyroscopic harness, working a heads-up

holographic display, command controls spinning 360 degrees with the

pilot's Comas the fighter SCREAMS after the fleeing raider.

The harness spins, the pilot coming clearly into view. Handsome,

intense, reckless eyes. MAJOR DON WEST.

INT.-SECOND BUBBLE FIGHTER

Another pilot (JEB WALKER) commands an identical craft, ROCKETING

towards the assault craft just below West's.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

West activates his targeting computer.

TARGETING DISPLAY-CLOSE. The fleeing Attack Ship jogs in and out of

the crosshairs on West's holographic array. West fires.

EXT.-SPACE

The Attack Ship SHOOTS straight up, dodging West's laser BLASTS.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

West closes on the fleeing craft, as Jeb engages the other Attack

Ship, lasers FIRING in the b.g., visible through the transparent

surface of the bubble glass under West's feet.

EXT.-SPACE

The fleeing Attack Ship loops in mid-space, reversing direction,

heading straight towards West's Bubble Fighter. A game of chicken.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

West doesn't flinch. Bears down, FIRING madly, the two space ships

heading straight for each other.

EXT.-SPACE

The two ships are ROCKETING towards each other, locked in collision

vectors, lasers FIRING wildly.              asdasd

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

TARGETING:DISPLAY-CLOSE. The Attack Ship flashes, captured in the

targeting hatchmarks. The display expands into a tactical grid.

EXT.-SPACE

Imminent collision.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

The hull of the Attack Ship fills his bubble glass.

West hits the firing stud.

EXT.-DEEP SPACE

West's pulse lasers converge on the Attack Ship barely meters ahead,

the ROARING craft EXPLODING directly before him.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

(OVER) WEST SCREAMS as he shoots through the sudden conflagration of

flame and debris, everywhere and then gone, giving way to the

blackness of space and the starfield beyond.

Below, the second Attack Ship ROARS past, lasers FIRING, locked in a

pinwheel battle with Jeb's Bubble Fighter.

EXT.-SPACE

JEB'S BUBBLE FIGHTER banks, avoiding the high energy volley. Almost. A

laser BURST grazes his Bubble Fighter, the surface of his craft

sparking, suddenly scored with flames.

INT.-JEB'S CRAFT

The Attack ship is right behind him.

EXT.-SPACE

The thruster core of Jeb's Bubble Fighter BLOWS off in a bolus of

flame, soaring back into the pursuit craft. The Raider EXPLODES.

INT.-JEB'S CRAFT

Controls are sparking. Displays flicker. (OVER) An ALARM sounds.

JEB-POV. The surface of Mars is rushing up fast.

EXT.-SPACE

Jeb's ship is barreling toward the planet.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

EXT.- MARS MINING COLONY

Three small rescue craft race skyward.

INT.-JEB'S CRAFT

Mars fills the view screen.

INT.-WEST'S CRAFT

The rescue craft are speeding toward Jeb's fighter below.

DON takes a beat. Then he spins his chair towards Mars, begins working

the controls.

West hits his thrusters.

EXT.-SPACE

West's craft dives toward Jeb's ship and Mars below.

INT.-JEB'S FIGHTER

Mars is coming up fast.

Mars fills the windscreen. Jeb checks his status display.

The canal streaked face of the Mars is all Jeb can see. He grabs his

throttle, engages his navigational thrusters and pulls.

EXT.-JEB'S SHIP

A tiny directional thruster FIRES, angling Jeb's craft so that it

scrapes the surface of Mars and dives into a giant canal, rocky walls

rushing up fast.

INT.-WEST'S SHIP

West is accelerating toward Jeb.

West slams a switch, deactivating his radio.

He BLASTS into the canal, walls rushing up on either side of him.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

Jeb's tiny craft is plunging toward the rocky crater floor below.

Overhead West's fighter appears, under full thrusters, roaring towards

the crater floor faster and at a sharper angle.

INT.-3EB'S FIGHTER

The canal floor is rushing up fast.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

Don is blasting toward the canal floor, almost as if trying to beat

Jeb's ship to a fiery impact below.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

West angles his ship directly under Jeb.

INT.-JEB'S FIGHTER

The expanding surface of Mars, visible beneath his feet, is suddenly

obscured by Don's fighter, swooping under his ship.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

Jeb's fighter is visible overhead.

West going up. Don angles the throttle.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

Don's ship, sandwiched between the surface of Mars and Jeb's fighter,

angles up and, like a cue ball hitting it's target, Knocks Jeb's ship

spinning toward the safety of space beyond. West's ship actually

scrapes the surface of the planet, sending up a plume of Martian dust.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

West pulls his throttle all the way back.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

West shoots up and out towards the dark of space.

The rescue craft converge on Jeb's ship as Don heads for base.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

WILL ROBINSON (10) hides in a small space, watching the commercial on

a jury-rigged, palm-sized computer. He mimics the Naylrator.

WILL-POV. Spying through the open slats of his biding place into...

INT:-LIVING ROOM-AFTERNOON

Basic twenty first century modern. MAUREEN ROBINSON stands, talking

with a PRINCIPAL who in less than happy.

The room lights suddenly dim. The Principal flickers, revealed as a

holograph, her head now sitting on Schwartzenegger body.

Maureen LAUGHS, then realizes the Principal has no idea her image is

being distorted. Maureen begins moving about the room, surreptitiously

glancing behind couches, into cabinets.

The Principal's body has become Twiggy's. Now that of an ape. Maureen

pulls open a closet. Will sits inside. Grins.

Will shrugs, adjusts his deck. The Principal returns to normal.

EXT.-HOUSTON - DAY

Probably Austin and Dallas too. Texas has become a giant urban sprawl

spreading into Mexico and beyond. Immense industrial air purifiers

hang in a dark, wet sky.

EXT.-HOUSTON SPACE COMMAND-ESTABLISHING

A giant dome topped pedestal towers ever the skyline.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-MISSION CONTROL-DAY

A MAN stands before a large viewscreen facing the throng of PRESS.

A suburban colonial, the launch dome towering in the distance.

INT.-ROBINSON HOME HALLWAY-SUNSET

PENNY ROBINSON (14) furious, turns, looks downstairs at Maureen.

She takes a beat, blinking away the tears. Lifts her wrist and turns

on a video camera watch. She begins down the hall.

VIDEO-POV. Penny's face in the monitor screen.

INT.-WILL'S ROOM-SUNSET

Penny enters a strewn, boy' a world. Will is trying to select items to

place in a single packing canister marked: PERSONAL CARGO.

Penny shows the camera her arm, covered by strings of ribbons.

Penny seems about to speak, instead just smiles, goes to his bed and

pulls off the sheets, begins knotting them together.

Penny knots the sheets into a rope, ties it to the bed-post. Will

lifts several palm-sized gold-plated stars. Each reads: 1st prize.

Penny tosses the rope out the window, prepares to climb.

CHAPTER 4: Major West

---------------------

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-CORRIDOR

John and the General walk the metal passageway.

The General palms an access panel. A door hisses open to reveal...

INT.-SPACE COMMAND- CONFERENCE ROOM-CONTINUOUS

A figure stands staring silently out the window. Don West. He offers a

salute. By his eyes, West is clearly agitated.

CHAPTER 5: Dr. Smith

--------------------

EXT.-DESERT-DAY

Sun beats hard on a MAN who stands on a windswept sand dune, talking

to a smartly dressed BUSINESSMAN.

(OVER) a KNOCK. The man reaches forward and presses a button. The

businessman, the desert disappear, only holographs.

Room lights.

Lights come up to reveal...

INT.-MISSION CONTROL-MEDICAL LABS

The man turns, revealing a face as clever an his eyes are evil. This

is DR. ZACHARY SMITH. He walks to the door, palms a panel, and the

portal hiss open. A TECHNICIAN ENTERS.

The Doctor moves to a circular overhead light board around which are

displayed the faces of the crew of the Jupiter craft. Removes the

micro-files, hands them to the technician.

He smiles, so sweet you can barely see the malevolence behind it.

CHAPTER 6: Welcome Aboard!

--------------------------

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-WALKING

Three small figures walk through a gantry towards the ship.

The figures have come to the saucer entry-port.

INT.-JUPITER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Don, John, and the General ENTER. Don's eyes widen.

West looks like somebody sprung for the full extras package on this

baby.

REVERSE ANGLE

Hi-tech heaven. Two pilots, chairs face a giant windscreen. Don walks

to the consoles that stretch toward the back walls.

Don strides to a pedestal in the center of the bridge. Flicks a switch

and a holographic Jupiter craft appears on the launch pad.

Don points to a row of man-sized glass cylinders on the back wall.

He approaches the blast doors that lead off the back of the bridge.

Don hits a wall panel which opens to reveal an immense ENGINE ROOM.

Just then the ELEVATOR rises from the lower decks. On its circular

platform stands a DOCTOR in a lab coat. She walks to the General.

She heads toward the readouts. West turns to John.

West turns to John. Dad?

EXT.-ROBINSON HOME-NIGHT

Lights burn in the windows.

INT.-ROBINSON HOME-DINING ROOM-NIGHT

John ENTERS to find the remains of an elegant dinner on the table,

candles never lit, food never eaten.

John crosses to a small scale model sitting on the table. Around it

hangs another gold plated 1st prize star. He smiles.

Maureen descends the steps in a bathrobe. Joins John.

Maureen is silent.

John stares at his wife. Then he reaches forward, touches her hair.

A beat. Then she moves to him. And he holds her close.

INT.-ROBINSON HOME-WILL'S ROOM-NIGHT

John stands in the yellow wedge of hall light. He touches something

hanging around his own neck. A pair of metal dog tags.

WIDER

Will lies in his bed, eyes closed. Asleep. A beat. John turns, heading

out into the hall.

EXT.-ROBINSON HOME-NIGHT

The bedroom lights go out, a normal home against the backdrop of the

launch dome towering in the distance.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-LAUNCH DOME-NIGHT

The Jupiter one stands amidst loading gantries, final supplies rolling

into the

ship on automated conveyer belts and lifts.

CHAPTER 7: Primary Directives

-----------------------------

PAN DOWN

TWO TECHNICIANS stand checking off supplies on a lightpad.

HOLD on a canister that reads: BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS: Do Not Open, as

it passes on the loading belt. FOLLOW THE DRUM as it winds along the

conveyer, up a gantry towards the Jupiter One. PUSH IN...

INT. -CARGO DRUM

Smith sits crouched inside, cleaning his nails.

INT.-JUPITER ONE-LOWER DECKS

A giant robot stands attached to its service bay. Still. Silent.

A SERVICE DRAWER slides open and a shadowy infiltrator emerges, his

face visible in the dim service light. Smith.

Smith approaches the docked Robot, places a small keypad device on the

Robot's dormant CPU panel. Smith activates the device.

Smith hits a switch on the panel and the Robot's system indicators

light into life. Smith types several keys on the keypad.

Smith taps the keypad. The Robot is silenced. Smith types again.

Smith completes his re-programming. Hits a switch.

Smith smiles. Removes the re-programming module.

Smith climbs into a chute marked WASTE DISPOSAL.

INT.-WASTE DISPOSAL CHUTE

Smith begins crawling down the chute. His tiny reprogramming module

BEEPS. Smith activates a tiny, built in com-link.

From the mic, the familiar visage of the Businessman is projected into

the crawlspace over Smith's face.

The Businessman smiles. SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled.

Suddenly the tiny module in his hand OVERLOADS, the flesh on his palm

smoking as Smith is engulfed in an electrical charge. He goes out, his

body perfectly still.

CHAPTER 8: Launch!

------------------

EXT.-SPACE COMMAND-MORNING

The giant dome shines in the early sun.

INT-JUPITER ONE  John and Maureen face will and Penny who stand now in

their freezing tubes. All  wear silver flight suits. Maureen moves

Penny's hair from in front of her face.

Maureen kisses her children. John moves to will who reaches to shake

at the same moment John tries to hug him. A beat. Then John tries to a

shake as Will goes for the hug. A total miss. Will backs into his

tube.

John kisses his wife, already in her tube.

Judy walks the row, checking their bio-monitors. Enters her tube.

Don walks to Judy's tube.

The tubes rotate closed around the Robinsons. Suddenly each crew

member is surrounded by a shimmering blue glow, brightening like a

star and then subsiding. All stand fixed in suspended animation.

Don stares at the family a beat. He goes to the main console. Straps

himself in.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-MISSION CONTROL

Welcome to the future. Banks of monitors manned by gum-chewing, pink

haired technicians. A giant monitor shows the Jupiter on the launch

pad. The CONTROLLER (NOAH FREEMAN) pulls in to his console.

Don presses a button and two giant blast shields close over the

Jupiter Two's main viewscreen.

He walks to the center of the bridge and activates the navigational

holograph, images forming in mid-air over the pedestal.

HOLOGRAPH- CLOSE. The Jupiter Two is visible, backed by the planets of

our solar system.

Don touches buttons and a highlight indicates the ship's trajectory

past mercury, around the Sun in a slingshot and into space beyond.

Don walks to the freezing tubes. He zips up his silver flight suit.

West climbs into his tube.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Don hits a switch and his tube closes. A beat then he is engulfed by

the blue

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship flies on into the endless night.

CHAPTER 9: Destroy!

-------------------

INT.-JUPITER TWO-WASTE DISPOSAL CHUTE-LATER

Smith lies still. He starts from a nightmare into...-a nightmare

INT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS

Smith scrambles out of the chute, stares at his hand, the impression

of the overloaded communicator seared into his palm.

He spins around disoriented. Stumbles to a closed view screen and hits

a stud. The blast shield opens. Space.

SMITH-CLOSE. Shock. No words.

THE ROBOT-CLOSE. In his docking bay. Suddenly the automaton powers up,

lights activating as his CPU comes on line.

Smith turns, slaps the burned out programming module on the Robot.

No response. The Robot continues to power up.

Smith engage interface. Initiate system shut-down.

The Robot disengages from the service bay, begins rolling forward.

The Robot rolls towards the bridge.

Smith grabs a wrench from a tool bracket, leaps for the Robot. The

Robot swings once, sending Smith flying into a flaring console.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL-NIGHT

Dark. A single Techie (ANNIE) mans the watch, playing holo-games with

a stylus over her desk. SCREENS flicker into life.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE

Still. The bridge doors open and the ambient lights come on.

The Robot rolls onto the bridge, faces the cryosleep array. He extends

his arms, an electrical charge arcing between his claws.

He fires, a blast of electricity hitting the cryosleep controls.

(OVER) ALARMS sound as the tubes begin to descend, electricity

sparking across the sleeping Robinsons.

Smith, wrench in hand, rushes the Robot, is again hurled across the

room. The Robot turns towards the navigational computer.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

Fully lit. All the monitors are manned by sleepy Techies. Noah ENTERS,

taking a coffee from Annie without breaking stride. , ALARMS flash

everywhere.

The Techies begins working the controls.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The Robot is facing the navigational holograph in the center of the

bridge. The electricity arcs between his claws once again.

Smith is slumped against the bulkhead. He shakes off his fall in time

to see the Robot fire at the navigational array, the holograph

disappearing in the flames of the exploding pedestal.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship begins to veer off course, falling towards the sun.

INT.JUPITER TWO

The Robot is rolling toward the com.

THE FREEZING TUBES are quickly being engulfed in flames. Smith

stumbles toward their control station. Begins typing madly.

He SMASHES a glass panel that reads EMERGENCY DEACTIVATE. The figures

inside the lowering tubes glow. All except Judy.

The Robot is before the Com, electricity arcing between his claws.

The Robot FIRES at the main Com, controls EXPLODING everywhere. The

freezing tubes begin to open, the Robot spinning to face them.

John blinks to life first. Emerges, ducking a BLAST of electrical

energy from the Robot, hitting the deck and rolling.

Maureen grabs Will and Penny, pulls them down just as the Robot blows

away their tubes.

John pulls a laser pistol from a wall mount.

The Robot spins towards John, FIRES an electrical charge - John dodges

at the last instant, the grazing blast burning his silvery suit,

singeing his side, sending into the wall, his gun flying.

Will ducks under his mother's arm, scrambles across the bridge.

The Robot FIRES at the scrambling boy but misses, Will disappearing

down the gunny hatch leading to the lower decks.

DON leaps from his tube atop the Robot's back, trying to grab the

Robot's power source. The mechanical monster electrifies his shell,

sending the Major flying.

The Robot turns to Penny and Maureen. Extends his arms toward them.

Electricity arcing between his claws. The two are done for. Maureen

puts her hand over Penny's eyes.

The Robot is about to fire. Suddenly the Robot freezes, his claws

deactivate, his power lights go to stand-by and he stands immobile.

WIDER. Will stands in the b.g., his tiny hacking deck in his hands.

The Robot turns and begins heading for the elevator. All watch in

amazement. Will grins, a familiar mischievous gleam in his eyes.

An EXPLOSION rocks the ship.

Penny stands over Smith who lays crumpled in the corner. Maureen grabs

an emergency medi-kit from a wall clamp, tosses it to Penny.

John is standing, helps Don to his feet.

Don moves fast to the helm. The main view screen is still closed,

covered by giant metal blast shields.

Maureen is at the life sciences console.

VIDEO MONITOR-POV. Penny is bandaging Smith's head, her bravado barely

masking her fathoml4ss terror.

A console FLARES. Penny fights back tears, terrified.

Don is at the navigational system.

Suddenly the lights go on, the air compressors begin to Hiss.

Penny in working ever Smith, bandaging his head. She runs stimulator

under his nose. Smith begins to stir, COUGHING.

West turns, spots Smith for the first time.

Don moves to the fallen figure, lifts him up against the bulkhead.

Don almost buys it. Then he notices Smith's hand, grabs it.

BURN-CLOSE. The reprogramming module's distinctive, foreign signature

seared into his flesh.

Don slams him against the bulkhead, begins dragging him towards the

airlock. The pilot hits a switch. The inner hatch opens.

REVERSE ANGLE

Maureen stands at Judy's freezing tube. The young doctor's cryofield

is sparking on and off.

Smith uses the distraction to palm-slam Don in the chin, knocking him

backwards. Don staggers, goes again for Smith.

Don freezes in his tracks.

Don's decision is lighting fast.

Suddenly the radio SQUAWKS into life.

VIEWSCREEN CLOSE. The blast shields part to reveal a giant fiery orb

in their path. They are heading directly for the sun.

John and Don stand over the Com.

DON straps himself into the pilot's chair.

SMITH stands at the freezing tube, Penny and Maureen assisting him.

Penny races off. Smith begins working the controls to Judy's freezing

tube.

Penny reappears, a case in hand. She presses a button and the case

unfolds into a hovering, gyroscopicaly-leveled gurney.

Smith hands Penny a wrench.

Maureen nods. Penny SLAMS the wrench into the power circuit. The

freezing field FLARES and deactivates, the tube swinging open.

LIFESIGN MONITOR-CLOSE. Flatline.

Smith and Maureen lower her onto the gurney.

Penny, Maureen and Smith rush the gurney out the blast doors towards

Sickbay just as the ship tilts madly.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

ON SCREEN-THE JUPITER TWO is heading towards the sun.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-SICKBAY

Penny, Smith and Maureen have transferred Judy onto a hi-tech

scanning-bed. A hovering holographic schematic of Judy's physiognomy

appears over her, descends onto her body.

No cardio-pulmonary or respiratory functions.

Penny unzips the silver material as Smith works the console,

highlighting her holographic heart.

The holographic image of her heart beats once, then is still.

The lights flicker on the bio-console, the holograph winks out.

CHAPTER 10: Initiate Hyperdrive

Smith holds her gaze, his eyes almost snake-like.

Maureen stares at him. A beat. She pulls a laser from the wall. Points

it at his forehead.

INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE

The ship is shaking in the mighty pull of the sun. Don is struggling

to keep the ship stable.

DON stares at him.

John takes Will's hand as West engages the hyperdrive.

West, John and Will, are hurled backwards from the sudden

acceleration, sticking to the walls and ceiling respectively.

INT.-SICKBAY

Maureen and Penny watch as Smith swaddles Judy in thermal blanket.

Suddenly, Maureen, Penny, and Smith fly against the walls. Judy is

held in place by the gurney straps.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

The graphic of the space craft is beginning to flicker as it merges

with the graphic of the sun.

Noah stares at the screen.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two flies into the mighty ball of the sun. And just as it

reaches the tallest of the gaseous mountains, the ship becomes

translucent, falling through the orb, elongating and then vanishing in

a sudden star of hyperspace.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

THE WINDSCREEN. The sky breaks apart giving way to a starfield.

EXT.-DEEP SPACE

Quiet. Empty. Suddenly space distorts and, in a sudden flash, a ship

appears, hurling into the darkness. The Jupiter Two.

The Jupiter Two comes to rest at the edge of an alien, twin starred

solar system, near a giant crimson planet.

CHAPTER 11: Lost in Space

-------------------------

INT.-JUPITER TWO-INFIRMARY

Maureen kneels before Penny and Will, making sure they're okay. Smith

stands silently in the b.g. Judy's gurney is empty. John ENTERS, his

face wrought with fatherly concern.

Just then Judy emerges through a door, zipping up her flight suit.

John holds her close, spared a father's worst fear.

Don turns towards Smith. Maureen steps between them.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE

Don in at the navigational holograph, patching sparking wires. The

rest of the crew emerge onto the bridge.

Don makes a connection. The pedestal powers up, a holograph of the

Jupiter Two appearing over its surface.

HOLOGRAPHIC PEDESTAL-CLOSE. The area around the Jupiter Two is now

filled with a holographic representation of the alien solar system.

Don just shakes his head.

Judy wraps her arm around her sister.

VIEWSCREEN- CLOSE. The nearest planet is starting to glow. Suddenly a

distortion field begins to emanate from the alien world. The edges of

space seem to sear away, leaving a glowing portal.

VIEWSCREEN -CLOSE. All the planets and constellations beyond the

portal appear to be in different places.

CHAPTER 12: The Proteus

EXT.-SPACE

Breaking the inner edge of the portal, a long silver space needle

catches the light from the dual suns.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The crew man their stations. Only Will is absent as they the ship

maneuver around the portal.

VIEWSCREEN -CLOSE. As they, move behind the portal it seems to

disappear, showing only the blackness of space. No ship beyond.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The Jupiter moves into the docking ring of the giant ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) a giant THUD as the Jupiter Two docks with the probe.

REVERSE ANGLE. The Robot in rolling in through the doorway, arms

waving wildly before him.

Don and John are up fast. But the Robot just rolls to a stop. Will

steps from behind the automaton, his hacker's deck in his hand.

He pulls a tiny mic from his deck. Lifts it to his lips.

Will points to several jury-rigged modifications.

All stare at him. Penny finally speaks.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-CREW QUARTERS-LATER

Penny stands guard, a rifle in her hand, talking into her recorder.

Penny's VOICE trails off. Stares out the porthole. Endless space.

Just then Don approaches, a silver bundle under his arm.

Penny steps aside.

Don smiles, winks at her, going through the door.

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

Actually a med-lab. Smith turns to face Don an he ENTERS.

Don tosses his bundle on the seat. A silver flight suit.

But Don is in his face in a heartbeat.

Smith stares at him a beat. Then he smiles, looks to the flight suit.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS

Will stands in front of the Robot, polishing a blast mark clean.

John enters, removes a gun from the weapons locker.

GUN-CLOSE. A small light goes from red to green.

An awkward silence hangs between them.

John looks at his boy Will in silent.

With that, John walks out. Will stares after him. Faces the Robot.

Will works his remote, sending the Robot towards the bridge.

INT.-PROBE SHIP

A long dark corridor. Slowly the ambient lights come up. A door opens

to reveal Smith, John, Don, Judy and the Robot, stepping out of the

docking chamber, the airlock closing in the b.g.

Don walks to a computer panel set into the wall. Begins typing.

The Robot rolls deeper into the alien ship. The others follow. More

lights flicker into life, illuminating the long corridor ahead.

Smith, John and Judy join Don at one of the bulkhead walls.

WALL-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphics are scrawled on the hull wall.

The sketches tell a story.

HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The alien craft docks with the giant ship.

SECOND HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE-A trio of inhuman bipedal stick figures enter

the giant ship.

THIRD HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The shape of a sun or a disc, from which juts

many legs. This final hieroglyph is circled in a clotted red

substance. Don touches the stain.

CHAPTER 13: Exploration

-----------------------

Don shoves Smith forward with the butt of his laser rifle, the group

heading deeper into the quiet ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will watches through the Robot's POV, toggling to move the automaton

forward. A readout marked AUDIO flashes. Will turns up a volume

control. (OVER) the sound of a slow, steady DRIP.

INT.-PROBE SHIP

The Robot turns, begins heading further down the corridor. (OVER) now

DRIPPING can be heard by all.

THE CEILING shows a jagged hole, covered with some kind of viscous

membrane, leading to the dark of a service tunnel above. The membrane

DRIPS steadily onto the floor below.

They head off. HOLD on the dripping membrane.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen is at the main sensor console working an instrument panel.

Penny is hanging upside down in a harness overhead, using a laser

welder on a giant mass of exposed ceiling circuitry.

Maureen throws a switch. The panel lights up, then goes dead.

INT.-SHIP-WALKING

The boarding party stand at the end of the corridor. Don presses a

wall panel. The giant doors hiss open to REVEAL...

INT.-MAIN BRIDGE

Immense. Empty. And battle torn. Sections of the controls have been

blown away. Blast scoring mars the walls.

Smith has moved off slightly, wandered over to a STORAGE ALCOVE.

Within, a row of docked Robots, larger and sleeker then ours.

John and Don are powering up the Com, console lights coming on.

MAIN SCREEN-CLOSE. Fills with snow. Then a figure can be seen. It's

Jab. But his hair is grey.

IN THE ALCOVE, Smith frees a power pack from one of the robots. Slips

it into the sleeve cuff of his field suit.

Judy stands by the life sciences panel.

A turning holograph appears over the console panel. A degraded image

of a trembling, viscous pouch. Tiny shapes move within.

Don notices Smith's standing in the storage alcove.

In the corner of the ceiling, another membrane covered hole.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is at his station, watching Don and John via the Robot's POV.

INT.-PROBE SHIP BRIDGE

A towering SHADOW shoots past the open doorway.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIDOR

Don races down the corridor. The walls are matted with flowering

plants. Vines twist into a carpet covering the metallic floor.

THE SCURRYING SHAPE, about the size of a small dog, shoots out from

behind a bulkhead, disappearing into the lush greenery.

Don pushes forward through the ever deepening brush until he comes to

a door. A plaque reads HYDROPONICS LAB. He races inside.

INT.-HYDROPONICS LAB

A jungle. John and Judy arrive behind Don.

The Robot arrives through the lab door, carrying Smith in one claw.

Don's eyes fix behind Smith's head.

Smith is suddenly silent. Don's hand shoots out, just missing Smith's

head, disappearing into the brush behind him, leaves flying, as-he

pulls from its hiding place a small creature.

About the size of a large stuffed bear, spiny skin going from leaf

color to red, shaped like a rhesus monkey but covered with the scales

of a tiny dragon and bright yellow cat's eyes.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is watching through the Robot's eyes.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-HYDROPONICS GARDEN

West stares down at the creature in his hand, now a calmer and more

friendly blue. Judy approaches.

As the beast struggles in Don's hand it changes color, chameleon like,

trying to hide. No luck. Don holds fast.

Don has begun stroking the creature's head. After a beat, the small

beast begins to COO and emit small BLIPPING sounds.

The beast has moved onto Don's shoulder, is now clutching there,

burying its tiny face into his neck. Don can't help but LAUGH.

As they leave, a dark shape skitters across the ceiling in the

background. Ominous. Unseen.

CHAPTER 14: Giant Spiders!

--------------------------

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Penny is still hanging overhead.

The sensor console comes back to life, displays lighting, status

lights going green. Maureen stares at the monitor.

SCREEN-CLOSE. Revealed in the sensor scan, the scallops pulse with

ambient heat. Penny lands beside her.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE

John is at the Com.

Don is sitting with the tiny creature. He pulls a ration pack from his

pocket. Turns it over in his hand.

The creature stares at him intently as he tears open the foil lip,

sucks a bit LOUDLY. Judy can't help but smile at him.

Don glares at him, hands the tiny creature the pouch. The creature

looks at it, emits a small BLIP, takes a tentative suck. Its eyes

widen in delight as it begins to suck the ration pack.

(OVER) a distant, high pitched WHINE.

Suddenly the creature begins to SCREAM, leaping on Smith's back,

clinging to his neck for dear life.

The WHINE is growing louder. it seems to be coming from above.

THE CEILING-CLOSE. There, in the corner, the membrane covering the

hole seems to be trembling.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen stands with Penny at the main sensor station.

ON SCREEN. The silver disks on the hull of the probe ship are

beginning to move, rising to stand now on spindraled legs.

EXT.-PROBE SHIP

Heads and legs emerging, the disks reveal themselves to be armor

plated spiders. The monsters find viscous holes in the outer hull and

push through, vanishing into the probe ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) a THUD. The Jupiter Two shakes, as if struck.

Penny works the console.

ON SCREEN. Spiders are leaping from the probe onto the Jupiter Two.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE

The lizard monkey's SCREAMING has reached new heights of hysteria. A

shape begins to push through the viscous bole in the ceiling.

What bursts in is a monster out of nightmare. Nearly half the size of

a human, shiny metallic body from which wet, spider-like limbs extend.

A fang covered vAw opens below ravenous, green eyes.

Don draws his laser and FIRES, but the blast only reflects off the

metallic surface of its torso, forcing the creature to retract its

limbs and eyes, hiding within its protective shell.

The team races for the door as several more spiders drop through the

hole in the ceiling, landing in the bridge and scampering fast towards

our fleeing heros.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-TUNNELS

The boarding party race down the corridor. The spiders are bounding

after them, using walls, floor, and ceiling with equal facility.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is madly working his keyboard, controlling the fleeing Robot.

A holographic robot appears on the bridge. Will steps inside, the

image now moving with his body. He spins, facing backwards, firing.

INT.-PROBE SHIP

The Robot is holding up the rear, its torso swiveled backwards so it

can retreat and FIRE simultaneously.

The Robot's plasma BLASTS have more effect than-the lasers, blowing

the spiders into tiny pieces of inhuman flesh and metal.

But more monsters are pouring through the holes in the corridor

ceiling, some giving chasing, others swarming injured comrades.

Judy watches as several spiders devour their fallen brethren.

Our heroes race to a nexus, corridors leading off in all directions.

Spiders are dropping from the ceiling around them.

INT. -JUPITER TWO

WILL-POV. A graphic map flashes within the holograph.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIdOR

The spiders are swarming, closing fast.

Judy pulls her gun, FIRES, hitting a ceiling sensor at the end of the

corridor. Blast doors SLAM, sealing out most of the spiders.

DON-CLOSE. Impressed.

BLAST DOORS-CLOSE. Metal teeth begin tearing through the steel.

Our group has made it to the door to the docking bay. They rush in,

the Robot coming through the open doorway last and holding there.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

Don activates the airlock to the Jupiter, the batch slowly opening.

The Robot stands in the doorway to the docking bay, FIRING at the

spiders as they come down the hall, blowing them away. More pour

through the now rending blast doors. There are just too many, rolling

towards them now like a single, shifting mass of death.

Judy throws him, hard, into the wall.

The first spiders reach the Robot, leaping onto its metal bull.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen and Penny are at the Com, powering up the engines. Will is

within the holograph, fighting off the spiders.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

The Robot's shell electrifies, the spiders recoiling.

The airlock has opened enough for our heroes to duck inside.

The Robot stands in the open portal, covered by spiders, their fangs

shredding his hull, his electrical charge beginning to SHORT.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is throwing off the monsters, Extending the Robot's antenna

spikes and scanner dishes to skewer spiders that are squeezing by.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

INT.-JUPITER TWO

INT.-JUPITER TWO-DOCKING BAY

A spider pushes past the Robot, head slipping around his metallic

body, bent on reaching the airlock and the crew within.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-AIRLOCK

Don hits a switch just as a spider breaks free, rushing towards the

dropping airlock door. Smith recoils from the swiping talon.

SMITH'S BACK-CLOSE. A tiny rand and beneath, a razor thin incision.

THE DOOR drops, the spider's arm, still twitching, severed inside the

airlock.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The inner airlock door Opens. The crew tumble in.

Don is already powering up the ship's engines as Smith tries

separating himself from the tiny lizard monkey.

He throws the beast hard across the bridge. The creature hits the

wall, SCREECHING, begins racing across consoles.

John has strapped in beside Don.

A MONITOR shows the hull of the Jupiter Two. More spiders are leaping

onto the ship, attaching themselves to the hull.

THE LIZARD MONKEY skitters up the back of Penny's chair, over her

head, getting tangled in her hair before jumping into her lap.

Penny in frantically wiping the hair from her face. The tiny creature

on her lap begins a perfect imitation of Penny.

Don releases the docking ring, glances at the Monitor. The hull of the

ship is now entirely covered with spiders.

LIZARD MONKEY'S EYES widen in terror as the ship SHAKES, burying its

head in Penny's chest. A beat. Then Penny hugs the tiny beast.

But she sounds anything but sure.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The Jupiter Two's engines BLOW, peeling into the endless night.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) ALARMS sound.

ON SCREEN. The hull of the Jupiter Two is covered with the giant

spiders, their teeth cutting through the outer hull.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The hull glows with electricity. The spiders fly off into space, their

limbs and heads retracting.

(OVER) a THUNK. Then another. A third.

ON SCREEN-The spiders shoot webs from their bellies, attaching to the

Jupiter, land on the hull again, re-extending their limbs, starting to

burrow once more.

Maureen emerges from the airlock holding the spider's severed limb in

metal tongs. Carries it to her life sciences analyzer.

MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A graphic of the severed spider leg. A small

line begins to extrapolate to the rest of the figure. Musculature and

flesh are drawn in on the screen.

VIEWS CREEN -CLOSE. More and more spider are spiraling from the probe

ship, all heading toward the Jupiter Two.

Maureen is working the COMPUTER.

Don begins typing.

MONITOR-CLOSE. More spiders are hitting the bull.

Don begins entering command codes.

The mighty probe ship begins to power up, engines glowing red as they

begin their initial BURN.

SCREEN-CLOSE. Spiders are eating through the outer hull.

Don engages the THRUSTERS, grabs the throttle.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two banks toward the probe ship, heading directly for the

wake of the fusion drives.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The outer bull flashes with electricity, the spiders jumping off. Don

pilots the craft directly through the wake of the fusion drive.

The spiders jump off, begin attaching themselves to the nacelles of

the giant probe ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

ON SCREEN the giant spiral of spiders in now heading back towards the

giant probe ship.

Don looks at John a beat, then he begins working the controls.

Don hits a button. On the remote control console a readout begins to

flash. The message is simple: FUSION DRIVE-OVERLOAD.

Don hits a button. The panel light flashes: OVERLOAD.

Don angles the ship away, punching the thrusters as the probe ship's

engines begins to glow.

EXT.-SPACE

The probe ship's nuclear core overloads. The engines begin to glow,

venting plasma and then EXPLODE like a nascent star.

THE BLAST WAVE spreads across space, vaporizing the spiders.

THE BLAST WAVE hits the Jupiter Two.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is buffeted by the shock wave.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is knocked into the atmosphere of the giant planet below.

The ship tilts on its side, passing between two snowy peaks, still

plunging towards the planet's wintry surface below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE

The Jupiter Two BLOWS over a carpet of snowy treetops, the canopy of

leaves bursting into flames from the friction of the hull.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The surface is coming up fast.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE

The Jupiter Two hits the surf ace of the water and skips, once twice,

three times across the alien sea.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship SMASHES into a crater miles long, PLOWING through rock and

vegetation, finally coming to rest near one of the crater walls.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Still. Automatic fire systems spray gas everywhere. only the dimmest

emergency lights cast any glow.

Maureen straightens, rubs her neck.

Don hits a switch, the windshield de-icing, becoming clear.

REVERSE ANGLE

Before them lies the crater, snow covered floor spreading out towards

a distant horizon stained red by two hanging crimson suns.

EXT. -ALIEN LANDSCAPE-NIGHT

The moonless sky is filled with an utterly alien starfield. The

Jupiter Two sits near the wall of the crater, its tiny lights fighting

the otherworldly darkness.

INT.-ENGINE ROOM

Cavernous. John and Don stand by the giant drive engines. Don is

holding a cylinder containing a mixture of power chips, some glowing

with radioactive fire, others dull and charred as coal.

Don's face is right up in John's.

The two are too close to do anything but kiss or fight. Kissing seems

less than likely.

WIDER. Maureen stands in the doorway.

Maureen turns on her heal and EXITS. The two men exchange a look.

They head after her.

Judy examines the lizard monkey. Penny strokes the tiny creature,

producing a string of BLIPS.

The tiny creature has begun playing with an aural scanner.

And with that Judy EXITS. Penny sits, stroking the tiny creature.

The creature makes a tiny BLIP.

Blip reaches out, touches a green ribbon around Penny's wrist.

Penny takes the ribbon off, ties it around Blip's wrist. Blip looks

up, eyes glowing. Penny caresses the tiny creature's cheek.

The creature reaches up, touches Penny's cheek. Her tiny tongue trying

to imitate Penny's words of comfort.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-MED LAB

Don shoves an indignant Smith into the room, adjusts a newly installed

security panel in the wall.

Smith stares at him a beat.

And with that West leaves.

Smith tries the door. Locked. Then, from one cuff of his field suit,

be removes the control belt he stole from the probe ship.

Smith moves about the room, lifting small bits of metal, creating an

impromptu set of tools with which to alter the control bolt.

PAN DOWN. HOLD on SMITH'S BACK. Beneath the rend in his suit, the tiny

tear in his flesh is now covered with tiny, alien scales.

INT. -BRIDGE-NIGHT

Judy sits in one of the command chairs over a the remains of a meal,

sipping water, staring out into the alien night.

Don comes and sits in the co-pilot's chair beside her.

Don turns on a monitor below the viewscreen. MONITOR-CLOSE. It shows

the star-field above. He lifts a light-tipped stylus.

Don begins to draw on the screen, connecting the stars like dots in a

children's book. Slowly, a familiar porcine face takes form.

Judy LAUGHS. She takes the stylus. Begins to draw.

Don smiles. Judy can't help but smile back. Their faces are close.

Don moves his face to hers, only a breath apart.

Judy smiles sweetly.

DON-CLOSE. Lips parting. Suddenly water begins to pour down over his

head. His eyes open wide. Judy holds her empty glass in hand.

She rises, walks off, leaving Don mopping his brow.

INT.-JOHN & MAUREEN'S QUARTERS

Maureen sits on the edge of her bed brushing her hair as John

activates the automated security systems.

Maureen looks out the window. A long beat. Then she smiles.

John presses a button, the blast shield opening to reveal the stacked

WILL-CLOSE. His eyes widen with shock.

REVERSE ANGLE

A giant portal shimmers at snow's edge about 100 yards from the ship.

Beyond it, a sun-stained field of towering plants and trees.

INT.-BRIEFING ROOM

The crew gathers at the table. (OVER) a RUMBLING. The ship shakes.

MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A geothermal analysis shows the giant plates

that make up this world appear mismatched.

Al1 eyes turn to John.

And with that Will storms out. John stares after him a beat, sorely

wanting to follow. (OVER) another RUMBLE.

INT. -BRIDGE

John, suited up, heads for the open front hatch when he spots Will

sitting alone in the Com chair, tinkering with his deck.

Will just shakes his head.

Will looks away, finally giving voice to his worst fear.

John stares at his son, unsure what to say, the boy's anguish so deep

and apparent. He reaches into his shirt, takes off his dog tags.

He lifts the chain and places it around the boy's neck.

Will is silent. John touches the boy's hair, then walks out. A beat.

Will looks up after his father, fingering the dog tags.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The Robinsons, all except Will, stand-gathered around the front of the

ship. Don has a small tracking device in his hand.

(OVER) the ground shakes again.

John kisses her. Don looks at Judy.

Blip reaches up and touches John's face. Then her CHIRPS form a rough

approximation of the words Penny taught her.

Then the two men bead off, towards the portal and forest beyond.

INT.-WILL'S CABIN

The beginnings of Will's home-made robot sits on the table. WILL is in

the f.g. riffling his PERSONAL CARGO container.

Penny ENTERS, an assortment of small electronic devices, hairclips,

and other metal and electronic objects. Dumps them on the table.

But Will just shakes his head, sulky.

She ruffles his hair. Disappears. Will activates a CPU speaker.

(OVER) a KNOCKING has begun. WILL looks up, puzzled.

Chapter 18: Danger Will!

INT.-CORRIDOR

Will walks down the corridor. (OVER) The KNOCKING continues. Will

follows the SOUND until he comes to the door of Smith's prison.

Smith is visible through the door window, sitting at a table,

hammering out the code with his boot. He beckons Will inside.

Will shakes his head. Smith begins TAPPING again.

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

The door slides open and Will ENTERS, a laser pistol in hand.

Smith eyes the weapon, moving towards the boy.

Smith barely misses a beat as he adjusts, passing the child, going

instead to the window and opening the blast shield.

Smith gazes out at the exotic terrain. (OVER) an inhuman WAIL.

Smith is silent. A long, lethal beat.

Smith turns away, hiding his smile.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY

Judy and Maureen are hanging on repelling lines before the crater

wall, shipping away ore that glitters like diamonds.

Penny stands in the f.g. with Blip on her arm, taking plant samples,

talking into her video recorder.

Blip jumps up on Penny's arm, knocking her recorder to the ground.

Blip stares at her, frightened by her tone, begins backing away to the

edge of the forest. She looks at Penny, then disappears into the thick

brush..

Penny heads after the creature. HOLD on her recorder. Forgotten.

CHAPTER 19: A Different Future

------------------------------

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY

Will and Smith are walking down a forest path. The boy has a radiation

tracker in his hand.

Dead ahead is a field of beautiful, alien flowers, their purple leaves

moving in the wind like an azure sea.

(OVER) a tremendous RUMBLING. The WIND ROARS. Suddenly, the air in the

distance begins to twist, a rushing distortion sweeping towards them,

flowers growing, landscape aging rapidly within.

Smith turns, begins to flee, pulling Will with him, away from the

rushing warp. Smith trips, falls, closes his eyes, waiting for the

distortion to overtake him. A beat. He opens his eyes.

SMITH-POV. A glowing, stationary portal shimmers behind him, revealing

beyond a forest ever older, darker, more overgrown.

No sign of the boy. Then, from behind a tree, Will appears.

The field across the portal has is now a mass of giant plants, the

flowers a deep red. Will rushes across the rip in space.

(steps back towards Smith)

Will takes Smith's hand, pulls him across the threshold.

SMITH-POV. Where he stands is now lush, the sky overhead a glowing

crimson. Yet behind him, the path in as it originally appeared.

Younger. The sky, bright. Will has run deeper into the brush.

Smith notices something by his feet. He clears away the brush,

revealing shapes beneath the foliage. His expression darkens.

Will has returned.

Smith shoves Will on, the boy unable to see what Smith saw.

PAN DOWN. Headstones. Each bears a marking, the names still legible.

Maureen, Penny and Judy Robinson.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY-PRES

John and Don emerge from the brush. They have come to one of the

crater walls. John looks from the rock face to his tracker.

(OVER) a sudden RUMBLING. The ground shakes. The ROAR of WIND. A time

portal rushes towards them like a glittering maw, the side of the

crater aging and crumbling in it's wake.

John and Don race away from the distortion, ducking falling trees,

roll clear as the portal stabilizes, now a fixed doorway to a darker,

more deserted future.

EXT.-BRUSH-DAY-PRESENT

Penny is pushing through the forest.

She spots the tiny creature ahead in the distance. Blip SNIFFS the

ground, runs a few steps. SNIFFS again. Looks up. There, before Blip

is another glittering hole in time. The forest beyond is far thicker,

the sky red. Blip steps through the portal.

Penny goes to the edge of the portal, stares at the monstrously tall

trees beyond. A beat. Then she steps through, following.

EXT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE

Penny pushes through dwindling brush to a series of rocky overhangs

and caverns cut into the crater wall.

BLIP is standing over a large circular stone, hopping up and down,

CHIRPING and BLIPPING madly.

(closing on the stone)

THE STONE-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphs are painted on the giant

rock, their images the same style as those on the probe ship.

HIEROGLYPH ONE-CLOSE. A mighty battle in space is depicted.

HIEROGLYPH TWO-CLOSE. A fiery star falls to the planet's surface.

HIEROGLYPH THREE-CLOSE. Here a dark haired beauty holds a single

lizard monkey aloft, her face remarkably like Penny's.

Suddenly BLIP begins to SHRIEK. (OVER) RUSTLING leaves.

SHAPES are moving in the trees, the vague outline of camouflaged forms

dropping to the ground. Five figures suddenly de-camouflage. Lizard

monkeys, two large, two smaller.

Directly in front of Penny, the largest monkey de-camouflages. Fully

grown, the beast is nearly twice Penny's height. Around the creature's

wrist is something odd. An old, tattered green ribbon.

BLIP begins to SCREAM and SHRIEK.

Too late. Blip leaps on the giant creature, grabs the ribbon. The

beast could slap Blip away like a fly. But the creature doesn't

resist, just stares down at Blip with something akin to tenderness.

Blip looks at the ribbon in his hand. Then at the one around her

wrist. Save for their age difference., the ribbons are identical.

The giant monkey moves forward, closing on a petrified Penny, paw

reaching out, touching her face. The beast begins stroking Penny's

cheek in a familiar gesture of comfort.

Penny stares up in stunned wonder.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Don and John are crossing the brush. The terrain in growing ever more

desolate, desert like. The double suns hang on the horizon.

Something catches the light on the ground beside them. Don reaches

down and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand.

METAL-CLOSE. On it is the familiar logo of the United Space Agency.

Don finds another piece of wreckage, turns it over in his hand.

WRECKAGE-CLOSE. The fragment bears a simple legend: Jupiter Two.

Suddenly Don is hit in the chest with a plasma charge, goes flying.

John ducks and rolls, FIRING his laser from behind the cover of a

rocky mound. John goes up to take another SHOT, is bit with a powerful

electrical blast, falling hard. Still.

REVERSE ANGLE

Rolling out from behind him, claws extended in attack Position and

apparently many years old, is a rebuilt Robot.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Will and Smith are crossing the alien terrain. The plants have given

way to desert. The suns hang low in the crimson sky.

Or what is left of it. Dark. The occasional COMPUTER panel flickers

Shattered monitors. An awful history-told in torn metal. John is

slumped in a corner, Don still on the floor beside him.

A FIGURE sits in the command chair, visage obscured by shadow.

But even as the words cross his lips, he knows it is.

The figure stands, light hitting his face. Late thirties. Long blond

hair, a shaggy beard and moustache. Eerily familiar.

The figure walks to one of the burned out panels.

The figure walks forward, into the light. Stands there a moment. Then

he lifts something hanging around his neck. Tarnished metal, old but

familiar. John's father's dog tags.

EXT.-CRATER CAVES-DAY

Maureen and Judy, lasers drawn, are pushing through the brush.

The four lizard monkeys are kneeling in a circle around Penny.

Penny rises, steps forward, carrying Blip. The other beasts hang back,

their faces genuflecting, almost reverential.

EXT.-CRATER CAVES -EVENING-FLITURE

Judy is examining the palm of the largest beast as Maureen scrutinizes

the images graven into the giant stone.

Penny and Judy stare at her in wonder.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

The Robot, shoving John with one claw, carrying Don in the other,

follows Older Will into the giant room.

War torn and pirated. A pit of molten lava bursts through the floor

above which floats a giant ball of silvery liquid held suspended by

the pulsing field of the hyper-drive. Tendrils of fire strain towards

the bubble. As they EXPLODE into the silver liquid, images form within

the sphere, nearly coherent, then gone.

A tracked gantry stretches from the floor, leading out over the

bubble. At the end of the track a crow's-nest of COMPUTERS SHOOTS a

single laser down into the center of the bubble.

Will moves to a control console at the base of the giant gantry.

Will hits a button. A generator opens, revealing a glowing cylinder of

core material incrementally descending into the console.

Will turns a switch on the control console. (OVER) More TREMORS. The

Smith grabs Will by the neck, pressing the barrel to his temple.

John stands facing older Will. Don is in the b.g., edging towards the

control panel and the descending core material.

Don has edged his way to the descending core material.

Don stares at him a beat. Then obliges, walking over to join John.

Smith approaches the Robot.

Smith goes into his tunic and removes his modified control bolt.

Smith slaps the bolt on the Robot's CPU. The automaton's arms go up,

then fall limp. Docile.

Smith activates the bolt. The Robot powers up once again.

The Robot's claws begin to glow with electricity. Smith smiles.

Smith walks to Older Will, puts the gun to his head.

Smith starts to pull Older Will away when Will comes forward, staring

at the time machine, eyes wide with awe.

Older Will's smile is bittersweet as he places his hand on his younger

self. Touches his hair.

Smith shoves the boy back to his father, turns to Older Will.

But Will just smiles.

SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled. Unseen, the boulder behind him seems to be

moving, shifting. A VOICE comes, alien, yet terrifyingly familiar.

The shape behind him unfolds, coming up now, long spindled arms and

legs, ten feet tall, a hybrid monster, half spider, half Smith.

Smith stands petrified as the creature approaches him on spindled

legs, goes down on its second knee joints, coming eye to eye.

Spider Smith flexes his three jointed arm.

Spider Smith reaches out and caresses Will's cheek. Turns  to John.

He grabs Smith's arms and begins to move him about like a marionette,

engaging in a bizarre dance with himself.

With that Spider Smith lifts Smith over his head and hurls him like

torpedo through a torn hole in the hull, towards the rocks beyond.

Spider Smith turns to face the Robot.

Smith throws the back of one hand over his forehead in a parody of a

twenties starlet.

His head comes forward, neck elongating so he faces WILL.

But Will's gaze is impassive. Spider Smith actually SIGHS.

ECT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE

Maureen and Judy are examining the heiroglyph stone. The ground

shakes. Birds SCREAM. (OVER) RUMBLING.

She turns. The clearing is empty. No Blips. No Penny. Blip runs cut

before them, grabs Maureen's hand, trying to pull her forward.

In Blip's hand, a mass of colored ribbons from Penny's wrists. Blip

waves them in the air, then races off. A beat. The women follow.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

The pulse laser is increasing its intensity, the corridor of images in

the bubble stabilizing. The TREMORS are increasing in frequency.

PAN DOWN

Spider Smith stands with Will, watching as the Robot shepherds the

crew towards the body of the ship.

Spider Smith starts climbing the gantry, truly like a spider, up

towards the bridge and crows nest hanging over the bubble.

Will walks to the control console platform, the platform now beginning

to rise on the gantry, towards the bridge above.

JOHN-POV. Something hangs from below the climbing Spider Smith's back.

It's an egg pouch of the kind they saw on the probe ship log.

The Robot FIRES a charge between its claws.

ON THE RISING CONTROL PLATFORM.

OLDER WILL-CLOSE. Frowns.

Suddenly, Smith's head drops INTO FRAME. The creature is hanging

upside-down. He smiles.

EXT.-GANTRY SYSTEM-WIDE SHOT

The platform bearing Will reaches the top of the gantry and begins

moving out across the bridge towards the crows-nest.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFORM-FUTURE

Spider Smith drops into place beside Older Will as the control

platform comes to a stop on the crow's-nest.

The core cylinder continues sinking into the console. Smith looks out

over the platform. Beneath them, imagine of infinity flicker.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. In the circle made by the laser, the images are not

yet stable, but discernable. Earth the day before the launch.

Smith stares at him. Then he smiles. A horrible sight.

Will turns a switch. The laser generated aperture narrows.

Spider Smith opens his pouch, revealing a thousand tiny spiders.

His arm whips out, grabbing Will, bringing him close, opens his mouth,

bearing venomous fangs.

INT.-MODIFIED JUPITER TWO-FUTURE

John and Don talk in the holding area. The Robot stands guard. (OVER)

the TREMORS are increasing in frequency.

The men look up. In the b.g., Will has approached the Robot.

The Robot stares at him a beat.

The floor trembles again. The planet is coming apart at the seams.

The Robot stands still a beat. Then he reaches towards Smith's control

bolt attached firmly on his CPU.

The Robot's claws lift into attack position, an electrical charge

building with dangerous intensity. He is about to fire.

At the last minute, the Robot jerks his hand upward, BLOWING away a

piece of the ceiling. He rips off the control bolt.

CHAPTER 21: Time to Die!

------------------------

EXT.-FOREST-DAY-PRESENT

Penny and Maureen chase a frantic Blip through the portal back into

the daylight of the present. Here, too, the world RUMBLES.

Penny stands in front of the Jupiter Two, beckoning them urgently.

Before Maureen can respond the ground RUMBLES, begins crumbling.

INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE

Don, John, Will and the Robot stand at the open hatch. Outside, the

ground RUMBLES.

A beat. Then Don extends his hand.

Just then Will and the Robot arrive.

John bites back a bittersweet smile. (OVER) another RUMBLING.

The Robot extends his claw. A panel opens on his arm and he tears out

a hand-made component. A conduit made from Will's golden first prize

medals, joined together to make a jagged star.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFORM-FuTURE

Spider Smith has Will against the rail.

And with that Will SMASHES Spider Smith in the face with two closed

lists. Smith recoils, lifts the boy aver his head.

Smith hurls Will over the rail towards the time pool below.

The creature walks to the end of the arm, stares at the forming

aperture into the past below him.

PORTAL-CLOSE. Images of the day before the mission launch swirl in the

laser-generated opening, growing ever more stable.

WIDER

Will is hanging over the time bubble, unconscious and unseen, dangling

from the gantry by a flashing chain around his neck.

CHAPTER 22: Time Travel

-----------------------

EXT:-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Don and the Robot, Will riding his back, navigate the terrain

alongside the ravaged hull of the Jupiter Two.

On the ground, crumpled in a heap, is Smith. Don checks his pulse.

(OVER) the rushing WIND. RUMBLING. A portal opens before them to a far

younger world. Then another portal, to a world far older. A third

portal RIPS across the sky overhead.

More portals are opening around them, others winking shut.

Through a new rip in time, the intact Jupiter Two can be seen in

relief of the battered future craft. The ground beneath their feet is

beginning to give way.

The PORTAL is beginning to shimmer. The ground starts to fall away.

Don hurls Smith through, Will, the Robot and West darting across the

threshold just as the portal winks closed.

EXT. -FOREST- PRESENT

The trees are bursting into flames an Will, Don, the Robot and Smith

emerge from the woods. Race forwards towards...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-PRESENT

The women are powering up the ship. The men are visible through the

windscreen. Outside, the ground in beginning to crumble.

Penny opens the air lock. Maureen holds close her son. Steps back.

MEE GROUND-CLOSE. A geyser of fire BLOWS into the air.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFoRm-FUTURE

(OVER) TREMORS. More lava is rushing up towards the mercury, the walls

themselves beginning to crack.

SMITH opens a gate at the end of the crow's-nest and a gang plank

unfolds above the doorway in time.

WIDER

John stands on the platform behind Smith, fighting star in hand,

slashes for his face. Smith moves fast, knocking the star to the

gantry bridge with his arm. John leaps on Smith, using his fists.

Smith's head moves from each impact, but the punches have no effect.

It smiles. Grabs John and hurls him across the platform.

The monster leans down over John. Opens its jaw.

John's hand is reaching towards the fallen fighting star. At the last

moment John grabs the metal weapon from the catwalk, slashes Smith

across the face, silver-red blood pouring down his cheek.

John feints towards Smith's head and then slashes low, cutting the

viscous membrane of the monster's egg pouch.

SPIDER SMITH-CLOSE. Surprised.

SMITH'S EGG SACK-CLOSE. Scores of the tiny spiders are pouring out of

the sack, rushing up towards Smith's face, tiny jaws chomping.

Spider Smith tumbles backwards, falling against the rail on the side

of the platform. John rises and rushes him, SHOULDER-SLAMMING him,

sending Smith hurling over towards the bubble below.

Spider Smith hits the bubble, missing the doorway formed by the red

laser and is swept up by the tides of time.

Spider Smith SCREAMS as he disappears and reappears in the various

half-formed images within the bubble before vanishing altogether.

John turns. The core cylinder has descended almost entirely into the

main console. only seconds before it's too late to retrieve it.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The landscape is a sudden inferno.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Don is at the Com. Maureen strapped into the co-pilot's chair.

Maureen stares a beat out the window.

Don hits the engine switch. The.mighty generators WHINE into life.

CHAPTER 23: Escape Velocity

---------------------------

The ship rocks as land masses on all sides begin to give way.

EXT. -JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The power drive begins to glow, diodes spinning. The landing struts

retract. The Jupiter Two begins to rise.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-INSERTION ARM-FUTURE

CONTROL CONSOLE-CLOSE. The core material in sinking fast. John moves

towards it when something on the gantry catches his eye.

GANTRY-CLOSE. Wedged into the grill work is a shiny scrap of metal

reflecting the setting sunlight. John's father's dog tags.

John rushes to the rail. There, still unconscious and hanging by the

dog-tag chain is Older Will.

CHAIN-CLOSE. The metal links are pulling apart. Will is seconds away

from falling into the pool.

JOHN-POV. The cylinder has completely sunken into the machine. It's

Will or the core material. No time for both.

John stands a beat, immobile. Then he drops to his knees, reaching

down as the chain breaks, grabbing Will's wrist at the last second.

The dog tags tumble into the pool below as John hoists Older Will up

onto the safety of the gangplank.

Will is still. Then, finally, his eyes open.

Will turns in time to see the core cylinder sink into the control

panel, the laser exploding in intensity below them as it drains the

cylinder's radioactive power. The world begins to EXPLODE.

John stares at him.

THE LASER-CLOSE. Reaches full power. The image in the time pool

stabilizes, becoming clear.

TIME POOL-CLOSE. Mission Control the day before the launch.

Father and Son stare into the past, eyes filled with wonder.

PAN UP. Through a torn hole in the hull and a glowing rip in space,

the Jupiter Two is rising into the flame ravaged sky.

INT.JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

The ship is shaking madly.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The fire GEYSERS are legion, giant chunks of the planet's surface now

falling away beneath them. A huge spew of flame rages from the

fire-pocked surface, hitting the bull of the tiny craft.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Judy is at navigation, frantically enhance the stabilizers.

Suddenly the panel EXPLODES, sending Judy flying across the bridge.

Penny races to her sister. Kneels. Judy's eyes are wide, still.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

The ground is breaking, falling into an endless fiery abyss below.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRES ENT

Another firestorm. A flame geyser hits the ship. Then another.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Control panels all around the ship begin to SLOW. The main screen is

hit by a flying chunk of rock. The giant glass begins to crack.

The windshield EXPLODES, sucking them both out into space.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The ship is hit by another fire geyser. The Jupiter Two EXPLODES.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

John and Will kneel on the crow's nest as the Jupiter Two dodges the

fire geysers in the sky through the torn hull. The ship is struck

once, again, finally EXPLODING in a ROARING ball of fire.

JOHN-CLOSE. A man who has lost everything he ever loved.

Will stares at his father and beyond him. There, in the time doorway,

a young Will walks towards the entrance to Mission Control in the

morning sun, innocent with no knowledge of the future.

Will reaches forward and touches the control console. The images in

the laser generated doorway begin to change.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. Instead of Earth we now see this planet's surface,

the Jupiter Two rising as it did just moments ago.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The Jupiter Two tries in vain to dodge the fire

geysers, then EXPLODING all over again. Will enters some commands.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The image in the portal begins to run backwards,

the Jupiter Two reconstituting from a ball of flame, receding past

diminishing flame geysers, beginning to land again.

INT.-CUPITER TWO

We are back in the ship just before take off. DON mans the Cam.

Maureen straps herself into the co-pilot's chair.

Maureen stares a beat out the window.

Don hits the engine switch. The mighty generators WHINE into life.

The roof of the hull is beginning to swirl, becoming translucent, like

water. There, standing above them, John and Older WILL.

2NT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-CROW'S NEST-FUTURE

The bridge of the Jupiter Two is visible in the laser generated

doorway. Older WILL looks to his father.

And with that he pushes John over the edge, the Professor falling down

through space and into the bubble and the doorway below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The ceiling becomes water an John drops into the ship. Maureen cradles

her husband. Then she looks up. Will is still visible through the

watery hull.

But the passage through time and space is already breaking up as the

world of the engine room EXPLODES in the b.g.

Maureen reaches up towards her son, reaching down, the two hands

almost touching before Will is gone, the portal closed forever.

Maureen holds him close. A small figure walks up beside them. Will.

A beat, then Will reaches up, hands him his dog tags.

John takes the boy in his arms, father and son finally holding close.

(OVER) more RUMBLING as the ground continues to give way.

John moves fast to the Com.

John smiles a beat, then he's all business.

(OVER) A tremendous CRASH.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The land masses are falling away beneath them, plummeting into

giant caverns of fire.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

West turns, hauls off and PUNCHES Smith, knocking him out cold.

Don throws the power switches to full.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The landing struts retract. The power drive begins to spin. The

Jupiter Two rises above the ground just as the firmament collapses

upon itself. Fire geysers ERUPT. History in about to repeat itself.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Don and John stare at each other a beat. Then Don smiles.

VIEWSCREEN- CLOSE. The world is breaking up beneath them, revealing a

fiery maw. DON GUNS the engines, heading straight for the chasm.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The tiny ship flies into the giant expanding crevice.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

DON is flying into the shattering center of the planet. Masses of

continents, some bearing forests, others oceans, all soar past.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The tiny ship flies deeper toward the molten center of the planet.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

A window out the windscreen a portion of the planet has torn away

revealing the black of space and the starfield beyond.

Don banks the ship toward the opening, flying past exploding fragments

of this shattering world.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship clears the planet as the world EXPLODES in the b.g.

CHAPTER 24: Alpha Prime

-----------------------

INT.-JUPITER TWO

DON guides the ship out into space. Judy comes up behind him.

DON shrugs, begins to turn away. Judy grabs him.

She gives him a long, passionate kiss. She lets him go, stunned.

Penny holds Blip in her arms, who has begun to BLIP madly.

Penny presses a button. Blast doors open on a storage hold.

(all stare at her)

Forms in the cargo hold de-camouflage. The other lizard monkeys,

standing amidst glittering canisters of Dimondium.

The Robot projects a holographic schematic of the galaxy. The Jupiter

Two is highlighted. Earth blinks at the other and.

(OVER) ALARMS. The shattered planet's core is turning bright red, a

sudden ROARING blast wave heading towards the ship.

Don throws the switch.

EXT. -JUPITER TWO

The planet's core EXPLODES as the Jupiter Two vanishes into

hyperspace, a sudden star and then gone.

FINAL FADE TO BLACK
