of white screen, burnt celluloid, etc.

SONG:		"SCIENCE FICTION DOUBLE FEATURE"

THE HERO

FIRE

The SONG ends with church bells ringing joyously as the IMAGE EXPANDS TO

WIDE-SCREEN.  The STILL FRAME bursts to life as the doors of the Denton

Catholic Church are flung open and Mendelssohn's wedding march resounds

from the church organ.

The young married couple, RALPH and BETTY HAPSCHATT appear followed by a

crowd of friends and well-wishers throwing confetti and shouting

excitedly.

The MINISTER shakes RALPH by the hand while RALPH slips him a $20 bill.

PHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures.

BRAD MAJORS, a young slightly awkward, clean-cut American in his mid-

twenties, comes over the congratulate RALPH.  BRAD and RALPH shake

hands.

BETTY, the bride, throws the bouquet.

JANET catches it.  She squeals with delight.

The GUESTS cheer.

RALPH & BETTY drive off.  GUESTS wave and shout, BRAD & JANET with great

enthusiasm.  GUESTS begin to disperse.

JANET & BRAD linger outside the church.  So do a strange FAMILY :  An

old man with a pitchfork and his wife and daughter.  They resemble the

Quaker family in "American Gothic", a painting.

The MOTHER (MAGENTA) and FATHER (RIFF RAFF) stand outside the church

doors.  Their DAUGHTER (COLUMBIA) goes inside.  The FAMILY, and the

MINISTER (FRANK N. FURTER), and the GUESTS all resemble characters we

shall meet later at the Frank N. Furter place.

FIRST CHORD OF "WEDDING SONG"

"WEDDING SONG" (Silent playback for dialogue)

With great decision BRAD turns on JANET

(Singing begins)

He chalks a heart and arrow on the church door, which Riff Raff proceeds

to wipe off.

JANET runs to him, he kneels and produces a ring.

CHURCH BELLS Peal out.  RIFF & MAGENTA open doors and solemnly enter the

church, door closes behind them.

JANET grabs the ring as BRAD rises.  She throws down the bouquet and

would fall into BRAD's arms but he goes to the door to chalk on it

again.

JANET, transfixed, bursts into the church.

"WEDDING SONG"  Pt. 2

JANET bursts into the church, hypnotised by the ring.  BRAD follows her.

BRAD & JANET start to walk d.s., arm in arm.

the strange FAMILY march slowly across them l/r., in front.

BRAD takes JANET's hands, turning to her.  We are aware of THE FAMILY

bringing in coffin in b.g. through vestry door.

(They separate)

THE FAMILY move into position behind BRAD & JANET

FAMILY lower coffin onto floor.

JANET runs to BRAD and he hugs her.

JANET circles BRAD twice, admiring her ring on the way.

BRAD & JANET kneel together with each following word until they are

kneeling on the floor)

BRAD & JANET kiss.

The cross above spits optically.

Mahogany bookcases, a large desk with a prominent globe of the world.  A

well-padded armchair has its back to the camera.  It swings around

revealing the NARRATOR.  He is in his smoking jacket.  He speaks

directly to us.

He crosses to the bookshelf.  He selects a dossier.  We see the title:

"The Denton Affair".  He returns to his desk and places it on a

bookstand.  He puts on his reading glasses.

He closes the book marking the place.

Thunder is heard distantly on the sound track.

Lighting cracks on the sound track.

A windscreen wiper working under strain.  Torrential rain on the

windscreen.  BRAD concentrating on visibility.  JANET eating chocolates

and listening to the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The

Shadow.

A motorcycle roars past them.

JANET takes another stick of gum.

Offers BRAD some.  He declines.

The car slows to a halt.

Headlights on sign reading: "DEAD END".

Car reverses.

BRAD puts his foot on the accelerator.  The wheel skids and explodes.

Pause

A bolt of lighting strikes a tree.

He unbuckles his seatbelt.

BRAD laughs.

A thunderclap.

MUSIC commences and she alights from the car and follows him, newspaper

over her head.

SONG:		"OVER AT THE FRANKENSTEIN PLACE"

The rain pours off the newspaper down JANET's face.  She walks along,

catching up with BRAD.

She sing plaintively.

We see the two of them - BRAD striding ahead, JANET nearly catching up

with him.

Behind them on the side of the road, sparse trees and rock formations.

They have passed a row of trees.  A rock formation in the shape of a

castle is silhouetted against the sky.  It has a flag flying from the

turret.

Lightning strikes.

A glow of light appears in a window.  It illuminates a path to the

castle.

BRAD and JANET turn.

The castle is in the distance between the two of them.

The castle looms in the distance.

BRAD stares hard.

The castle looms closer.

Taking JANET by the hand, BRAD moves off the roadway towards the house.

Lighting strikes.

JANET jumps towards BRAD.

The castle seems to move forward.

A motorcycle convoy roars by revealing a hidden road to the castle.

The convoy drives up and disappears into a secret entrance in the rock.

We see a cell-like window near a massive lighted window.  A tortured

face appears squinting into the darkness.

Lightning strikes.

RIFF RAFF moves to the lighted window where his hunchbacked shape

becomes a giant shadow.

BRAD and JANET start moving down the driveway.

Shadow turns in the window.

BRAD and JANET approach the gateway to the castle.

The shadow slowly covers the whole window.

BRAD and JANET are at the gate.  There is a rusted sign.

A bolt of lighting illuminates the sign which reads:  FRANK N. FURTER -

SCIENTIST.

The NARRATOR is in his armchair.  He leans forward with some urgency.

Thunderclap.

BRAD rings the doorbell.  It makes a strange sound.

The door opens.  Throbbing music is heard in the background as if there

is a party going on in the distance.

The figure we have seen at the window emerges.  He is a hunch-backed

servant, RIFF RAFF.

A bolt of lighting illuminates a row of vehicles parked by the castle.

BRAD sees them and reacts with surprise.

RIFF RAFF realises BRAD has seen them.

They enter apprehensively.

RIFF RAFF leads them down a stairway and beckons them to follow.

The MUSIC has become louder.

They arrive at a hallway at the bottom of the stairs.  Another servant,

MAGENTA, who bears a striking physical resemblance to RIFF RAFF is

vacuuming the stairs.

JANET steps over the vacuum lead.

BRAD and JANET look at MAGENTA, surprised by her voice.

BRAD and JANET are rather unnerved by this outburst from the domestic.

They look back to RIFF RAFF.  He is now standing by a set of mirrors

reflecting to infinity.

MAGENTA gives RIFF RAFF a strange signal.

RIFF RAFF starts to dance in an extraordinary fashion.

BRAD and JANET are amazed.

MAGENTA half closes her eyes in pleasure.

JANET clings to BRAD.

RIFF RAFF opens a set of double doors marked BALLROOM.

BRAD and JANET find themselves on a balcony of a huge black and silver

ballroom.  At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding

it, a theatre proscenium.  In the body of the room are GUESTS.  They are

the people BRAD and JANET passed on the road.  They are the

Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from

all over the earth.  It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention -

announced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom.  They are

all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear.  They are a distorted

version of the GUESTS from the Denton wedding.  A party spirit prevails,

they throw their arms out in a plea to RIFF RAFF on the balcony.

JANET falls into BRAD's arms.

RIFF RAFF is ecstatic.

BRAD revives JANET.

JANET faints again.

The NARRATOR moves from his desk to the wall behind him.  He pulls down

a chart with illustrated dance steps on it.  He gestures to the

appropriate section of the diagram with the pointer.

The GUESTS leap to the left in one giant step.

NARRATOR points to next step on the chart.

ALL GUESTS have hands on hips.

The rows of GUESTS open out with pelvic thrusts.

We see them from the balcony and they open out in formation.

JANET revives.

The GUESTS re-form.

BRAD and JANET make a run out the door.

They collide with MAGENTA who has blocked off the corridor with her

vacuum.  She sings with menace, waving the cleaner hose dangerously.

BRAD and JANET look at each other in alarm.

BRAD blushes.

They are back at the balcony.

They are at the edge of the balcony.

They force BRAD and JANET into the Ballroom proper.

The GUESTS turn on them.

BRAD and JANET are completely dismayed.

COLUMBIA, a young girl, is the household groupie.  She sings with the

band at the end of the Ballroom.

BRAD and JANET are reeling.

NARRATOR.  He has now become rather involved in the dance and is

standing on the blotter on the top of his desk.

He jumps to the left.

The GUESTS take one.

The NARRATOR dancing on the desk.

OVERHEAD TRAVELLING SHOT.

LOW TRAVELLING SHOT between their legs.

Everyone reverses direction.

All the GUESTS fall to the floor like flies exhausted.

No one laughs.

GUESTS turn nasty.

BRAD and JANET retreat to the hall.  Behind them a lift slowly descends

bearing a figure in a black cloak and a diamante stiletto heel - beating

time to a rhythm the band has started playing.

GUESTS rise, staring mesmerised at the lift.

JANET sees the shoe, looks up at the face of its owner.

JANET faints.

The figure turns and throws open lift cage door.  As camera zooms in to

the death mask above them the film changes from black and white to

colour.  However the only colour in evidence is the red lipstick on the

mouth of their host.

SONG:		"SWEET TRANSVESTITE"

RIFF RAFF scowls.

FRANK strides across the Ballroom to the throne.

JANET gives a silent scream.

FRANK lets the cloak fall onto the throne, which reveals his

transvestite attire.

The GUESTS scream with delight.

He slowly moves back to BRAD and JANET, doing leg kicks.

He circles them and forces them into the Ballroom.

BRAD clumsily attempts to circle around FRANK.  FRANK meanwhile ignores

him and greets his other guests.

JANET joins BRAD.

FRANK turns on them.

FRANK turns his back on BRAD and JANET and splitting the ranks of his

GUESTS, departs for the other end of the Ballroom.  Streamers fall.

From the throne he gestures towards BRAD and JANET rather slowly over

the next verse.

We view from OVERHEAD as the GUESTS surround him adoringly.

FRANK storms down the Ballroom to the lift.

On the last chord the lift has disappeared.

The GUESTS applaud ecstatically.

RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA close in on BRAD and JANET.  They remove BRAD and

JANET's wet clothes.

COLUMBIA moves down from the bandstand and crosses to BRAD and JANET.

She witnesses the undressing.

The GUESTS moan softly as each piece of clothing is removed.

BRAD and JANET stand shivering in their underwear.

There is complete silence.

The GUESTS and SERVANTS are motionless.

BRAD and JANET are the total object of their attention.

He turns to COLUMBIA who has been staring at his underpants.

RIFF RAFF has opened the cage doors to the lift.

The GUESTS rush for positions.

COLUMBIA escorts them to the lift.

RIFF RAFF throws two GUESTS to the floor to make room for them.

He slams the cage door.

The two discarded GUESTS cry and claw at the cage door as the lift moves

off under RIFF RAFF's control.

BRAD and JANET are squashed, arms by their side.

They stare straight ahead.

General amusement.

The lift grinds to a halt.

They have arrived at the laboratory.

The laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating

theatre and a Greek gymnasium.  It is pink-tiled throughout, facing the

lift entrance is a circular area containing a TANK on pedestals which

though screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the body of

ROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised

dias area for the GUESTS, and facing one end of the tank, the

operational controls, monitor and a giant refrigerator.  A chandelier

hangs above the tank.

On the podium in front of Frank's chambers there is a stand microphone.

Near the podium are some weights.  Behind the tank is a vaulting horse.

These are wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents.

The GUESTS are waiting as the lift arrives.

FRANK, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the room.  RIFF

RAFF gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he

hands to FRANK.

As he speaks her name each one steps forward out of the lift.  They

cross to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.

BRAD & JANET step out of the lift.

MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the podium.

The room falls silent.  All eyes are on FRANK, waiting for his reaction.

A smile breaks on his face.

MAGENTA & COLUMBIA laugh.

THE GUESTS oh and ah appreciatively, BRAD laughs, a little embarassed.

RIFF RAFF has approached behind FRANK, looming over his shoulder.

FRANK drinks his champagne then hands RIFF RAFF the empty glass.  RIFF

RAFF goes to the control panel and FRANK to the podium

MAGENTA, COLUMBIA and GUESTS laugh politely.

There is a gasp from COLUMBIA, MAGENTA and GUESTS.

GUESTS and everybody applaud.  JANET claps too, but BRAD indicates that

she shouldn't.

MAGENTA & COLUMBIA step forward one each side of him.

GUESTS applaud.

Everybody applauds.  FRANK then pulls the cover from the tank.  RIFF

RAFF is at the control panel.

The tank is revealed.  There is something inside it is immersed in clear

fluid.  The GUESTS are astonished.

RIFF RAFF flicks the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the panel.

RIFF RAFF presses a button three times then begins to unwind a wheel.

FRANK watches excitedly from behind the tank as the chandelier is

lowered.  It spurts different coloured liquids into the tank.

The liquids bubble and change colour.  The thing inside begins to look

like a human form.

The liquids drain away.  The form begins to move.

FRANK climbs the ladder at one end of the tank, RIFF RAFF the other.

ROCKY HORROR sits up, raises his arms, finally stands upright with both

arms outstretched.

RIFF RAFF removes the bandage from ROCKY's head.  ROCKY looks at RIFF

RAFF then at FRANK.  With a gasp he leaps for the chandelier above.

At the same time RIFF RAFF is down the ladder making for the handle.  He

winds up the chandelier and ROCKY.

SONG:		THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES.

ROCKY HORROR with only his head unbandaged, is hanging on to the

chandelier which RIFF RAFF is winding upwards.

FRANK runs down the ladder and kicks RIFF RAFF who starts to lower the

chandelier.  FRANK climbs up the other steps to meet his creation coming

down.  MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the tank.

As ROCKY gets level with him, FRANK lunges for him but lands inside the

tank....because...

ROCKY simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between MAGENTA and

COLUMBIA who now each have a pair of scissors with which they will snip

his arm and leg bandages.

FRANK, in the tank behind ROCKY, puts his arms round ROCKY's neck.

ROCKY spins away.  MAGENTA and COLUMBIA hang on to one end of his chest

bandage so that it undoes as he goes.

ROCKY is now unbandaged.  He strikes a pose.

During the last sequence, FRANK climbs out of the tank onto RIFF RAFF'S

shoulders and purses ROCKY, but they fall.

NARRATOR reading from book.

FRANK and RIFF RAFF are recovering from their fall.

ROCKY makes a circuit of the GUESTS.

ROCKY set off at a run as FRANK looms up again.

(FRANK is chasing ROCKY round the lab.)

At the end of number, ROCKY has climbed up the ladder attached to the

end of the tank nearest the bridal chambers and FRANK is in a heap

below.  RIFF RAFF is behind the tank and MAGENTA and COLUMBIA in their

positions in front of it.

FRANK picks himself up.  ROCKY is sitting at the top of the ladder above

him, with his perfect limbs near Frank's face.

ROCKY looks hurt.

FRANK crosses behind ROCKY to stand next to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.

JANET nods hastily.  FRANK moves towards microphone.

SONG:		CHARLES ATLAS (Pt. 1)

As FRANK starts to sing, MAGENTA & RIFF RAFF collect one of ROCKY's

presents, the vaulting horse, and place it in front of the podium.

COLUMBIA leads ROCKY down from the ladder.

MAGENTA & RIFF RAFF now bring the weights.

ROCKY throws down the weights and begins press ups.

FRANK crosses to JANET & BRAD

FRANK moves back to ROCKY who is still pressing up.

The large refrigeration unit door slowly opens, falling like a

drawbridge.  Inside is a wall of ice and many CocaCola bottles.

Through these bursts an icy EDDIE riding a Harley Davidson motor bike,

ex World War II, holding a Gibson guitar.

Several guests are crushed to death.

ROCKY looks terrified.

JANET has fainted yet again.

EDDIE comes to life.

COLUMBIA leaps on to the pillion seat.

The MOTORCYCLISTS GUESTS remember only too well.

COLUMBIA rushes to the switchboard, flicks a lighting switch and all the

lights above the stairs start changing colour.

The GUESTS go crazy and rock and roll all over the staircase.

COLUMBIA dances with EDDIE.

Even RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA step it out.

EDDIE (more confident, less frozen) leaps onto the motorbike in a legs

apart guitar strumming pose.

FRANK is getting furious.

ROCKY is perplexed.

EDDIE slips onto the pedal starting the bike.  He takes off and roars

round the laboratory, even riding up and down the walls.

4 bars instrumental (saxophone)

FRANK steals towards the fridge where he collects an ice pick,

innocently.

On the last chorus FRANK rushes to EDDIE with the ice pick, in a

demented fury.

THE GUESTS are unbelieving.

COLUMBIA covers her face with her hands.

EDDIE is dead.  FRANK walks away from his body unconcerned.

JANET screams and screams.

DIALOGUE SEQUENCE

MAGENTA is very bored and picking up ice cubes and placing them in the

ice bucket.

RIFF RAFF drags EDDIE's dismembered body back into the fridge.

ROCKY cowers in terror.

ROCKY flexes.

FRANK is thrilled.

RIFF RAFF presses a button and a wall opens revealing a bridal suite

done out in black silk.

The GUESTS shout their approval.

The end of the SONG turns into Mendelssohn's wedding march and FRANK

leads ROCKY to his bridal chamber.

The GUESTS throw confetti.

BRAD and JANET look at each other in amazement.

JANET looks lost.

She sits on the end of the bed.

BRAD looks lost.

He examines the TV monitor.

RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA by the monitor.

They switch from channel to channel.

We see BRAD looking at the TV monitor.

And JANET sitting on the end of the bed.

JANET lies back on the bed and switches off her bedside lamp.

RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA smile at each other.

Only a soft glow of moonlight from a barred window.  ON the netting

round her bed.

There is a knock at the door.

JANET sits p.

BRAD's voice from behind the door.

She relaxes.

A silhouette enters and crosses to the bed.  It moves onto the bed

behind the net curtain.

She switches on the light to reveal FRANK.

FRANK sits up.

JANET beats his chest with her clenched fists.

He re-commences making love to her.

FRANK places a finger on her lips.

He switches off the light.

RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA stare intently at the screen.

They smile at each other.

Silhouette of FRANK and JANET making love.

JANET squeals with excitement.

We see ROCKY chained to the bed sleeping.

In the background RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA in laboratory.

ROCKY stirs and makes a sound.

RIFF RAFF walks across to the door and stares at the sleeping body.

His eyes are full of hate.

He looks at MAGENTA.

She nods to him.

He releases the chains.

ROCKY stirs.

RIFF RAFF picks up a candelabra from the bedside table and taunts ROCKY.

ROCKY jumps out of the bed, terrified.

RIFF RAFF pushes the candelabra in his face.

ROCKY crashes through the laboratory and escapes.

RIFF RAFF turns to MAGENTA who is now standing in the doorway.

RIFF RAFF puts down the candelabra and they exchange a strange sign.

A knock at the door.

BRAD opens it cautiously.

A shadowy figure moves across the room to the bed.

BRAD takes her hand.

He gently lays her down on the bed and attempts to caress her.

BRAD sits up.

The shadow rolls over.

BRAD reaches out to the light.

BRAD switches on the bedside lamp an realises he is making love to

FRANK wearing a JANET wig.

BRAD grabs FRANK around the throat.

BRAD lets him go and turns away humiliated.

Suddenly the shadows are illuminated by the monitor as an image of

RIFF RAFF appears on the screen above the bed.

FRANK is getting carried away.

A shot of pack of huge alsations careereing around the castle grounds.

They are chasing a bewildered Rocky.

JANET is lying on the bed posed in the style of a "True Romance" comic

heroine.

BRAD is posed in the style of a "True Romance" comic hero.  He is

nervous and smoking.  Behind him FRANK is asleep on the bed.

JANET is sitting on the end of the bed.

JANET is at the door.

The NARRATOR is leaning back in his armchair, cool and considerate.

JANET is pacing around the tank which is covered by a cloth.  She

becomes aware of the sound of someone crying inside.  She pulls the

cloth back to reveal ROCKY lying in the tank - exhausted and bleeding.

ROCKY HORROR looks miserable.

JANET crosses to the TV monitor.

She switches on the monitor.

She changes the channels on the monitor getting various empty rooms

in the castle.

Occasional shot of alsatian dogs.

Till finally she switches into BRAD's bedroom and sees BRAD sitting on

the end of the bed and FRANK lying asleep on the bed.

ROCKY smiles helplessly.

JANET moves away from the monitor and back to ROCKY.

ROCKY nods.

ROCKY smiles at JANET.

A new expression crosses her face.

COLUMBIA and MAGENTA are watching the monitor.

They giggle.

SONG:		"TOUCH A TOUCH ME"

ROCKY is lying on the operating table.

JANET is dabbing his wounds.

COLUMBIA and MAGENTA.

JANET rips off a piece of her petticoat for a bandage.

She rips off another piece of her petticoat.

JANET rips another piece off her fast vanishing petticoat.

During the next verse she bandages ROCKY.

JANET grabs ROCKY's hands and places them on her.

COLUMBIA & MAGENTA are watching the TV relay of ROCKY & JANET.

They are amused by JANET'S inexperience, parodying her as they sing.

We see JANET's p.o.v. of all the characters singing the last line:

COLUMBIA & MAGENTA's reactions.

JANET & ROCKY in each other's arms hear another scream in the distance.

FRANK is chasing RIFF RAFF with a whip.  BRAD is following.

RIFF RAFF rushes into the lift and presses the button desperately but

FRANK follows him and so does BRAD.  We see the lift descending.

RIFF RAFF slides across the laboratory floor escaping FRANK's whip.

RIFF RAFF gets to his feet keeping a careful eye on the whip hand.

RIFF RAFF switches channels on the monitor.

An image of a middle-aged professorial man in a wheelchair appears.

The man is outside the castle, peering around the trees stealthily.

FRANK and BRAD crowd around the monitor.

On the monitor the stranger looks very shifty.

FRANK looks BRAD hard in the eye.

DR SCOTT is indeed in the Zen Room.

FRANK throws a switch marked "TRIPLE CONTACT ELECTRO MAGNET".

We see DR SCOTT's wheelchair screaming through corridors, rooms and

doors and ends up clamped to the electro magnet in the laboratory.

BRAD is amazed.

DR EVERETT SCOTT is even more amazed.

FRANK releases the electro magnet.

The wheelchair hits the floor.

BRAD looks embarrassed and humiliated.

FRANK cuts in quickly.

A stifled gasp is heard from JANET behind the curtain.

FRANK is surprised.

FRANK crosses the screen and pulls back the curtain to reveal

JANET and ROCKY.

ROCKY reviles FRANK with a look.  He puts his arm around JANET.

FRANK is appalled.

ROCKY is terrified.  He takes his arm away from JANET.

A GONG is heard.  MAGENTA comes through the broken tiles.

FRANK & RIFF RAFF exchange a look.

He gives JANET, who is virtually naked, a seering look.

FRANK leads the way to the lift.

At the head of a large coffin shaped table sits FRANK.  There is an

electric carver on the table in front of him.  The table is laid for

dinner and present are JANET & BRAD on FRANK's right, DR. SCOTT opposite

him, ROCKY HORROR on Dr. Scott's right and between ROCKY and FRANK,

COLUMBIA.  They sit in silence as the double doors open.

RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA enter.  RIFF RAFF carries a large joint of meat,

MAGENTA the wine, both of which they set down at the head of the table.

RIFF RAFF & MAGENTA pour out the wine and return to the side of FRONT

who then rises.

FRANK now proceeds to carve the meat.  Everyone is quiet and only the

buzzing of the electric carver is heard.  RIFF RAFF & MAGENTA distribute

the slices, then return to their places.

Everybody looks at their food carefully.

COLUMBIA rises.

She rushes from from the room with a ghastly cry.

BRAD & JANET look at each other, then at DR. SCOTT.

FRANK threatens him with the knife.

DR. SCOTT silences BRAD with a gesture.

SCOTT picks up some meat on a fork and regards it.

133

DR. SCOTT produces scrapbook, opening it at a picture of Eddie's mother.

DR. SCOTT turns page to a picture of a record of Elvis, singing Teddy

Bear.

He turns the page to porno. magazine.

He turns page to show an advertisement for Harley Davidson.

He turns to a still of Eddie as an addict

He turns to reveal a newspaper clipping "Thug bashes woman, 66".

Turns the page to Eddie's mug shot.

The page turns again revealing the lyrics.

135

She has a large portrait of EDDIE on the wall.

She is lighting the candles on her dressing table.

She collapses in tears.

137

DR. SCOTT produces the note.

DR. SCOTT's hands tremble with the note.  JANET & BRAD are now standing

one each side of him.

EDDIE'S TEDDY:  REPRISE

FRANK suddenly pulls away the tablecloth to reveal a glass coffin

containing the decomposed remains of EDDIE.

RIFF RAFF & MAGENTA laugh.  JANET screams and runs to ROCKY who hugs

her.  BRAD looks shocked.  DR. SCOTT wheels back his wheelchair in

disgust, FRANK moves d.s. towards ROCKY.

JANET runs out, FRANK in pursuit.

ROCKY smiles wanly.

Encouraged by this, FRANK smashes JANET across the face with the back of

his hand.

She runs out of room.

JANET runs down corridor - FRANK following her.

BRAD appears, pushing DR SCOTT, in hot pursuit.

JANET arrives at door of laboratory - she can't open it.

FRANK arrives face to face.

The door opens - they fall through.

The door slams in DR SCOTT's face.

JANET rushes in, down the ramp, with FRANK in pursuit.

DR. SCOTT & BRAD arrive in the lift.  FRANK has circled the tank and

arrived at the control panel.

DR. SCOTT, BRAD & JANET find they are stuck to the floor.

FRANK climbs up the ladder beside the tank.

(music under this dialogue)

FRANK leaps off the tank to the floor.

FRANK circles JANET, testing her thighs.  BRAD struggles in vain.

SONG:		"HOT DOG"

JANET screams out.

She cried so loudly that FRANK staggers backwards towards the control

panel.

RIFF RAFF & MAGENTA enter through the hole in the tiles - they march

to behind the tank and then the control panel.

FRANK signals to MAGENTA.

BCS MAGENTA's hand on the transducer switch.

BRAD is turned into a statute.

FRANK signals, cut to the switch as it is turned on.

DR. SCOTT is a statue.

FRANK signals.  C.S. SWITCH.

JANET is stone.

DIALOGUE SEQUENCE.

FRANK throws a switch, she turns to stone.

He crosses over to RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA

RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA nod sympathetically.

He lies on the operating table.

They massage.

MAGENTA betrays her resentment by digging her fingernails into his neck.

FRANK leaps up from the table.

The lift moves downwards.

Left alone in the laboratory MAGENTA and RIFF RAFF smile at each other.

They make a special sign and leave by a secret passageway.

MUSIC:	"THE FLOOR SHOW"

We see the stage at the end of the ballroom with red velvet curtains.

FRANK is enjoying dressing the statues which are now on stage.  Each one

is lovingly fitted with extravagant variations on the stocking and

suspender belt variety of his own fantasies.

Footlights glowing on the curtains.

FRANK pulls a switch and the curtains open.

Red velvet curtains open to reveal statues in front of silver drapes.

The floor is covered with a light mist.

FRANK beams and pulls lever.

COLUMBIA's statue comes to life.

FRANK switches.	ROCKY leaps to life.

BRAD animated by FRANK

JANET animates.  She behaves like a sex goddess, completely out of

control, as if performing in a burlesque show.

We PULL BACK on the whole stage.  The velvets open to reveal the 20th

Century Fox logo as a stage set.

At the top of the staircase FRANK appears bathed in light.

He wears a dazzling version of the national costume and a chiffon cloak

which billows in the breeze from a wind machine.  He is reminiscent of

a 30's film star.

The floor opens to reveal a swimming pool glistening with chlorine

and glitter.  He beckons the GUESTS.

In their drugged state they comply with his every wish.

FRANK enters the pool.

They begin to immerse themselves in the pool.

DR SCOTT animates belatedly.

He observes the orgy occurring in the pool.

The wind machine blows the blanked from his lap and we see legs,

stockings and a suspender belt.  As in a miracle he can walk again.

BRAD surfaces, his face betraying consternation.

He is pulled back into the pool.

A thrilled JANET now emerges.

FRANK breaks through the water on a lift from ROCKY.

SONG:		FLOOR SHOW PT. 3 - WILD AND UNTAMED THING.

FRANK dives into the pool.

During the chorus the whole group are diving in and out of the pool in

a frenetic water ballet.

They emerge from the pool and form a kick line.

The doors at the opposite end of the ballroom open.

SONG:		"RIFF RAFF'S RECIT"

RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA now dressed in military style space suits, face

FRANK from the opposite end of the ballroom.

They applaud slowly.

RIFF RAFF has a ray gun.

The characters on stage freeze - terrified.

It's a showdown across the ballroom.

FRANK looks stunned.

FRANK is guilt-stricken.

The GUESTS scramble for the safety of the wings.

MAGENTA turns to leave.

SONG:		"I'M COMING HOME"

FRANK moves slowly to centre stage.  During the song he adjusts

footlight controls to give him what effects he requires.

The others help FRANK out by singing from the wings.  COLUMBIA operates

a spotlight.

BRAD closes silver curtains.

He kicks on cloud projection.  Blue skies appear.

FRANK falls on his knees.

DR SCOTT switches on wind machine.

MAGENTA who during all this has been filing her nails, looks up at FRANK

who is in an attitude of supplication.

RIFF RAFF moves slowly to the stage.

FRANK looks appalled.

The GUESTS are deeply troubled, realising that they also are not part of

the "We".

He produces a ray gun.

FRANK raises himself to his full height.

As RIFF RAFF pulls the trigger, COLUMBIA dashes between them.

She is killed instantly.

RIFF RAFF fires again at FRANK.

FRANK takes a leap fro the rope on the curtain.  The entire proscenium

crashes under the weight.  And FRANK is crushed to death among the

velvet and glittered facia.

ROCKY breaks down completely.  Although he despised FRANK, he was all he

had in the world.

He rushes to the body and cradles it in his arms.

RIFF RAFF can stand no more.

He fires a blast of laser beam at ROCKY who starts climbing the stairway

towards the fox skyline.

RIFF RAFF fires again and again.

With the body of FRANK in his arms, ROCKY beats on his chest and lets

out a wild sound like a giant beast of the jungle.

RIFF RAFF fires a sustained beam.

ROCKY climbs to the top of the Fox sculpture.

RIFF RAFF fires again and again.

They crash to their deaths.

MAGENTA has found the entire sequence of events quite distasteful.

The GUESTS flee down the ballroom and out the door.

We see the laughing figures of RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA making a special

sign to each other.

We see BRAD and JANET fleeing with DR SCOTT following behind.

RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA's laughter has subsided.

There is a huge explosion.

We see the entire castle surrounded by a giant beam of light and then

vanish into space.

During the explosion sequence the film reverts optically to black and

white.

SONG:		"SUPER-HEROES"

BRAD, JANET, and DR SCOTT's bodies are scattered on three sides

surrounding a crater where the castle once was.

The scene is arid and deserted.  There are remnants of DR SCOTT's

wheelchair, EDDIE's coffin and broken objects from the laboratory.

BRAD, tattered and bleeding, lifts himself up.

DR SCOTT drags himself to his knees.

The three of them stand shakily on the perimeter of the crater.

All that is left is dust and sand and wind and the sun.

The CAMERA PANS from face to face in a circular movement getting faster

and faster as the trio sing a chorale of hopelessness.

The CAMERA has spun into a blur but focusses on a spinning globe

of the earth on the NARRATOR's desk.

The NARRATOR puts his hand on the globe, stopping it.

He is standing over his lectern reading from his book like a preacher

in a pulpit.

He turns and goes to the door of the study.

He switches off the light.

He leaves the study, shutting the door.

It's almost dark in the study.  Only a sinister glow inside the globe

of the earth remains.

SONG:		"SCIENCE FICTION, DOUBLE-FEATURE"
