----------------------------------------------------------------

FADE IN:

ON BRIGHT, OUT-OF-FOCUS, OVAL-SHAPED COLORS.

The colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression

of looking through a kaleidoscope.

As the image comes into sharp focus, we discover that we are

inside a CANDY BOWL.  A MAN'S FINGERS are frantically

removing all the cherry-flavored pieces of candy.

EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY

The man performing this curious task is

writer/producer/director, VIKTOR TARANSKY, forties,

conservatively dressed in suit and tie.  He sits alone at an

empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage,

some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows

the table's paper cloth.

Viktor finishes sorting.  Finding no trash can to deposit the

rejected cherry candy, he scoops them into his pocket.

A young headset-clad P.A. hurriedly approaches.  He looks

ill.

Viktor reads the young P.A.'s panicked expression.

EXT.  TRAILER - DAY

NICOLA ANDERS, twenty-something, A-list actress, beautiful

face scowling, is supervising her ASSISTANT ferrying clothes

from a movie trailer to a limousine.  VIKTOR desperately

follows after Nicola.

Viktor looks up in horror.  The trailer next to Nicola's does

indeed appear to be fractionally taller.

Viktor looks to the tires.  His face suddenly brightens.

Viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately

stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen.  Air hisses out.

Nicola ignores Viktor, marching towards her limo with her

PUBLICIST.  Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her.

Viktor stops, nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm.

Nicola is stunned.

The door slams and the limo roars away.  Viktor looks to the

still hissing trailer tire.  The CREW regards Viktor

apprehensively.

The crew is uncertain what work there is to do.

INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT

In an ornate bedroom, NICOLA lies on her death bed under a

veil of netting.  A distraught man, HAL, sits close by.

A NUN enters.

The nun withdraws.  Hal holds his face in his hands, almost

breaking down.

Nicola dies peacefully.

INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY

VIKTOR sits with leading man HAL, THREE EXECUTIVES and studio

head ELAINE CHRISTIAN, watching a rough assembly of the film.

It ends with a close up of NICOLA ANDERS.

The lights go up.  The image of Nicola fades off the screen.

Elaine finally speaks up.

The executives, leading man and director nod sagely.

Elaine ushers Viktor out of the screening room.

EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY

ELAINE and VIKTOR talk in the shadow of an enormous

soundstage.  They speak more freely in each other's company.

He produces a handful of candy from his pocket.

Elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor paces.

A pause.  Viktor reads Elaine's face.

Viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the

news.

Elaine also eats some more candy -- a curiously intimate

moment between them.

Viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages, left

alone on the deserted lot.

EXT.  STUDIO ENTRANCE - DUSK

Twenty NICOLA ANDERS' FACES jiggle into frame.  VIKTOR's face

appears amongst them.

They are cardboard figures, standing together in the trailer

of an electric cart.  A WORKMAN is collecting the promotional

standees from around the lot.

VIKTOR places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out --

we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen

year old girl, LAINEY, appears beside him, carrying a laptop

computer.

Viktor, embarrassed by his childishness, steps aside for the

suspicious workman who carries the standee away.

Lainey smiles sweetly.  She hugs him.

She glances towards the entrance where Lainey's mother,

ELAINE, and her dependable, uncomplicated businessman

boyfriend, KENT, wait beside Elaine's car.

Viktor shakes the idea of Kent and Elaine from his head.

Lainey kisses the forlorn Viktor goodbye.  She runs to her

mother and Kent.

EXT.  STUDIO BUILDING - SOME DISTANCE AWAY - DUSK

From a distance ELAINE and KENT regard the lonely figure of

VIKTOR.

Elaine climbs in the car as Lainey approaches.

EXT.  STUDIO BACKLOT - TRAM - DAY

CLOSE UP on a copy of "Variety".  The front page banner

headline: "ANDERS RIDES OUT OF 'SUNSET' -- Cites Creative

Differences"

The man reading the trade paper sits in the back of a tram on

a studio tour -- HANK ALENO.  He wears a pair of spectacles

with one lens blacked out, his head tilted on one side.  It

is an item buried on the inside pages that catches Hank's one

good eye.

The tram pauses.  The TOUR GUIDE keeps up a commentary.

When the tram departs, we discover that Hank has exited the

tram and is hiding in the facade of a New York subway

entrance.  The tag around his neck reads, "VISITOR -- Stay

With The Tour".

EXT.  STUDIO GATE - NIGHT

VIKTOR wheels a stack of film cans on a dolly while holding

several framed black and white photographs of screen legends

under his arm.

HANK, hiding in the shadows of the soundstages, spies Viktor.

He hurries towards him as Viktor approaches his antiquated

Bentley.

Viktor takes a step back, concerned once again about the

man's motives.

Hank once again indicated the bulge in his pocket.  Viktor

now understands the significance of the gesture.

Viktor loads his film cans into the car.

Viktor's car roars away.  He looks back at the forlorn Hank

in the rear view mirror.

A huge eye from a dismantled Nicola Anders billboard is

wheeled away behind him -- followed by a huge pair of lips.

INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - DAY

A sea of ingenue headshots.  Black X's are drawn through all

of them.  VIKTOR lies amongst the rejected faces, talking on

the telephone, in his spartan bachelor beach house.

The phone goes dead.  Viktor tries to re-dial --

disconnected.

Sharp knock on his door.  Viktor peers through a curtain and

spies an official-looking MAN IN A SUIT, carrying what looks

to be a legal notice in his hands.

Viktor slips out of the back door.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

VIKTOR hurries along the beach.  When he turns, he discovers

the MAN IN THE SUIT following him.  As Viktor runs, the Suit

runs -- calling out to him.

Viktor stumbles.  When he recovers, the Suit is on him.

The Suit hands Viktor a heavily-sealed envelope.

The Suit departs.  Viktor hesitates, then breaks the seal on

the package -- inside he finds a hard-drive.  The hard-drive

is labeled "SIMULATION ONE".

A TITLE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN:

CLOSE UP ON

a VACUUM CLEANER cleaning a tatty red carpet.

On the other end of the vacuum cleaner is VIKTOR.  The red

carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the

venue for the premiere of "SUNRISE, SUNSET".  To save money

on posters, Viktor has altered the originals, "Starring

NICOLA ANDERS" crudely pasted over with "Introducing SIMONE".

EXT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - DUSK

VIKTOR regards the sad, little premiere.  No paparazzi, no

limos, no klieg lights.  Resorting to giving away tickets to

PASSERS-BY, Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in

trash.

A taxi pulls up.  Viktor's daughter, LAINEY, steps out.

Viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesn't have quite enough

cash.  Lainey pays herself.

VIKTOR escorts Lainey down the empty red carpet, regarding

the pathetic premiere.  As they walk by, the bulb in Viktor's

sole spotlight expires.

They are interrupted by the THEATER OWNER.

EXT.  PIER - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - MORNING

A foggy, empty pier.  A MAN is running through the mist,

shouting desperately.

Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and

hood, her back to us.  The camera pushes in, music swells and

she turns.  SIMONE.  She is exquisitely, ethereally

beautiful.  Perfect.

INT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

In the near-empty, dilapidated theater, "SUNRISE, SUNSET" is

playing ON THE SCREEN.

When Simone's face appears, the faces of the AUDIENCE MEMBERS

change.  They are all visibly moved, including the THEATER

OWNER.  Some weeping, some with curious smiles on their

faces, some opened-mouthed.

Suddenly a GUNSHOT rings out.  Simone collapses to the

ground.

INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

VIKTOR, unable to watch, paces up and down, chain-smoking

while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth.  Viktor finally

musters the courage to look inside the auditorium.

INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT

The same scene that played in the studio screening room.

However now when we cut from the leading man, HAL, to the

leading lady it is not NICOLA but the newly cast SIMONE.

INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

ON SCREEN SIMONE lies dying.  Now even LAINEY is affected by

Simone's performance.  She wipes a tear from her eye.

VIKTOR watches the backs of the heads, trying to gauge the

audience reaction.  Finally the credits roll.

A dedication, "For HANK".

No one moves from their seats.  Viktor permits himself a

brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the

credits:

Still no one moves from their seats.  Viktor cannot stand it

any longer.  He runs to the restroom.

INT.  THEATER RESTROOM - NIGHT

Face over the stained sink, VIKTOR splashes himself with

water.  He looks to the mirror, horrified by his own

reflection.  He rehearses a courtroom speech.

Three AUDIENCE MEMBERS enter the restroom.  They approach the

urinals.

Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits, missing

the end of their conversation.

All three nod in agreement and begin to urinate.

INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

VIKTOR exits the restroom.  Almost all the AUDIENCE MEMBERS,

including LAINEY, are waiting for him.

Viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group

spontaneously applauds.  They rush to shake his hand.

Viktor appears uncomfortable with their compliments.

The group drifts away, leaving LAINEY and VIKTOR alone.

Lainey regards the makeshift poster.

Viktor's head snaps around.  Lainey smiles.

Viktor shrugs off the misunderstanding.

INT.  VIKTOR TARANSKY'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT

VIKTOR enters his sterile, bachelor home, carrying his mail.

His answering machine blinks in the darkness, the message

light reads "FULL".  He hits the "PLAY" button.

Viktor opens a drawer containing a photo of he and Elaine

from happier times.  He gazes at it as he listens to the

message.

Viktor stops the machine, dazed.  He idly opens his mail.

Inside an envelope he finds a SAG Card with the new member's

name, "SIMONE".

A MONTAGE OF SCENES BEGINS TO PLAY.

A)  A line of AUDIENCE MEMBERS stretches outside the rundown

B)  THE FRONT PAGE OF "VARIETY" coming off the presses reads,

C)  A TEENAGE BOY in a public library logs on to the first

D)  Trendy TEENAGE GIRLS saunter past a swimming pool in

E)  In a Third World back-alley a YOUNG ASIAN MAN shows an

F)  A LIQUOR STORE CUSTOMER watches a TV behind the counter

G)  The ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER now stands outside a

INT.  LIMOUSINE - DAY

VIKTOR, watching "SCENE" on a TV in the back of a limousine,

corrects the reporter.

EXT.  STUDIO GATE - MORNING

Outside the studio entrance, a swarm of REPORTERS,

PHOTOGRAPHERS and FANS rush VIKTOR's limousine, hoping for a

glimpse of SIMONE.

Studio SECURITY GUARDS hold them back as the limo enters the

lot.

EXT.  STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY

ELAINE and an entourage of EXECUTIVES greets VIKTOR's

limousine on the studio steps.

A STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHER has a camera at the ready.  A banner

reads, "Welcome SIMONE".  A YOUNG ASSISTANT wheels a cake.

VIKTOR steps out of the car.  ELAINE pushes past him, into

the limo.

The car is empty.

Elaine sighs, exasperated.

The reception committee disperses, murmurs of disappointment.

Viktor strides up the studio steps.  Elaine stares after her

ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound

arrogance.

EXT.  STUDIO - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY

The studio soundstages as a backdrop, VIKTOR approaches a

podium and a forest of microphones, revelling in his recent

fame by association.

A REPORTER rolls her eyes at his pomposity.

The reporters all call out at once.

Viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his

hands.

Viktor exits the podium.  A voice stops him in his tracks.

Viktor turns.  The voice belongs to over-zealous, crusading,

truth-seeking investigative reporter, MAX SAYER, accompanied

by his assistant, MILTON.

Milton confirms that Woodward and Bernstein are still living.

Viktor walks away.

Max watches Viktor depart, with obvious suspicion.

EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - DAY

A large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage.

"CLOSED SET" is the sign on the door -- a surveillance camera

panning the entrance.  A SECURITY GUARD, also keeping watch,

nods a greeting to VIKTOR as he pulls up in his studio golf

cart, script in hand.

Viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters

the soundstage.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

The cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for

a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a

tablet attached to a large, projection screen monitor and two

side monitors.  VIKTOR takes a seat in front of the monitor.

A title appears on his computer screen.

With a satisfied smile, Viktor backspaces characters until he

revises the title to:

He presses "ENTER" and a face begins to build -- wire upon

wire, pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian

emerges -- SIMONE.  She is indistinguishable from a flesh-and

blood actress.

Simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background --

titled "VISUAL LOOP 6".  Within the confines of the monitor

she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal.  She looks a

little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for

too long.

Only now do we observe that Viktor is occasionally talking

into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a

key on his keyboard.  When he speaks, she speaks.  Simone's

voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to

Viktor's voice.  A scanning light on Viktor allows Simone to

mimic his movements.

Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to

the terminal -- from the "L.A. Times" obituaries.

Viktor looks up, Simone mimicking his action.

Viktor's conversation with himself is not merely for his own

amusement.  He is adjusting and refining Simone's voice.

Viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars, living and

dead, that comprise Simone.

Viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen

dedicated to Simone's audio, incorporating the vocal

deliveries -- "20% STREEP, 80% BACALL".

He speaks once again as Simone to test the adjustment.  The

voice patterns appear on his screen -- graphic

representations of the sound waves.

VIKTOR snaps back to reality himself.  He scrolls through the

list of screen legends.  He clicks on the image of AUDREY

HEPBURN.

A clip of AUDREY HEPBURN in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" plays on

the screen.  Hepburn, sitting on a fire escape, looks up.

With a CUT and PASTE, Viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly

into a frozen Simone.  Viktor presses play.

Viktor gets up and starts walking around the room, warming to

his theme.  SIMONE moves in a VISUAL LOOP on the monitor,

nodding attentively as if she's really interested.

Feeling uneasy at the prospect, Viktor changes the subject.

He pulls out his script for "ETERNITY FOREVER".

Suddenly, Simone appears to talk on her own.

On a side monitor, we discover a highlighted box marked "PRE

RECORD" -- Viktor's finger on the "PLAY" button.  He is

unable to resist speaking another line.

Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing him a kiss --

until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked,

"GESTURES OF AFFECTION -- WINK, SMILE, GIGGLE, SIGH, KISS,

FLUTTER OF EYES, FLICK OF HAIR, PUFF OF CHEST".

Viktor comes close to the monitor.  He notices something

about Simone's face.

Viktor accesses a program labeled, "DISTINGUISHING FEATURES".

He adds a "FRECKLE" and a "MOLE".

From a distance we watch him, alone with Simone in the vast,

empty soundstage.

EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY

VIKTOR's face against the SKY.  As he walks, we reveal that

the sky is no more than a huge, painted backdrop on the

studio lot -- behind a parking lot.  Viktor hands his valet

ticket to a fawning VALET MANAGER.

Viktor joins other industry MOVERS and SHAKERS waiting for

their cars under an umbrella.  A young TALENT AGENT

approaches.

The agent's face falls.  He gets in his car, disconsolate.

Suddenly, HAL SINCLAIR, rushes over and hugs Viktor.

Behind his back, Viktor surreptitiously presses a button on

his cell phone.  The phone rings.  Viktor feigns surprise and

answers.

A hush descends over the executives.  Hal is suddenly very

uncomfortable.  Even the VALETS strain to eavesdrop on the

conversation.

The other INDUSTRY PEOPLE make a note of the remark.  A

mortified Hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave, climbing

into his car.

Viktor hangs up.  His car pulls up.  He tips extravagantly

and drives away.  The INDUSTRY PEOPLE get on their cell

phones.

EXT.  STUDIO LOT - FACADE - DAY

Parked behind the sky facade is a curious CAR with shaded

windows.

INT.  CAR - DAY

Inside the car, MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON, scanner in

hand, are replaying Viktor's intercepted phone call on a

computer.

They continue listening to the recording.

MAX's eyes light up.  He gazes to a photo of SIMONE pasted to

the inside of the car.

INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - MORNING

VIKTOR and LAINEY make breakfast.  Lainey is in her pajamas,

occasionally glancing to a laptop computer as her father

prepares French toast.

Lainey grabs the plates and opens the deck door.  We hear a

chorus of CLICKS.

Viktor joins her at the doorway.

Unfazed, Lainey retreats into the house.

EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING

Boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full

of telephoto lens-toting PHOTOGRAPHERS.  The next door houses

have LENSES protruding through the drapes of the windows.

VIKTOR strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto

the beach, soaking up the attention -- unable to resist

waving extravagantly.

Suddenly, a PHOTOGRAPHER, losing his balance, drops from a

nearby rooftop.  The photographer limps towards the fence.

Viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera

and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly

relishing the attention.

The photographer clambers over the fence where he joins

several dozen other SHUTTER-BUGS and VIDEORAZZI.

MAX SAYER from "The NATIONAL ECHO" is at the head of the mob,

accompanied by assistant MILTON.

INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY

VIKTOR drives along a twisty mountain road, LAINEY in the

passenger seat.  They have become so blase about the

paparazzi, they no longer acknowledge the posse of motorcycle

PHOTOGRAPHERS risking their necks to stay up with the car.

Lainey gives her father a smile.  Through the car window

behind her, a MOTORCYCLIST appears to lose control and drops

down a bank.

EXT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY

VIKTOR'S car pulls up to Elaine's imposing mansion.  LAINEY

gives her father a kiss and departs.  ELAINE, in the garden,

overseeing a GARDENER pruning roses, approaches.

INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY

VIKTOR walks down a hall, passing the dining room, where KENT

is working on a computer.  Kent smiles blandly.

INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY

VIKTOR waits in an opulent drawing room.  Despite the eighty

degree temperature outside, a fire burns in the hearth.

ELAINE enters, waving a thick studio file.  Viktor's face

falls, expecting a less business-related conversation.

Elaine refers to her documents, bewildered.

Viktor regards Elaine with a condescending look.

Elaine escorts Viktor out to the lavish garden.

EXT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - GARDEN - DAY

ELAINE's demeanor softens.  She speaks to VIKTOR quietly,

sympathetically.

From her bedroom window on the mansion's second floor, LAINEY

smiles at the sight of her mother and father together.

INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

VIKTOR enters his office where he's greeted by his assistant,

JANE.

INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

VIKTOR sits at the head of the table, surrounded by HAL,

LOTUS, MAC and three other CAST MEMBERS.  A preliminary

poster behind him -- "COMING THIS SUMMER - SIMONE in ETERNITY

FOREVER" -- bears a huge photograph of Simone's face.

The CAST nods seriously.

Viktor nods to a speaker phone in the center of the table, a

red blinking light on the phone.  The cast reacts excitedly.

Everyone laughs giddily.

Viktor exits.

The CAST stares nervously at the speakerphone.  Mac breaks

the silence.

The other cast members introduce themselves.

EXT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

VIKTOR pulls up sharply in his studio golf cart outside the

nearby soundstage and hurriedly enters.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

VIKTOR races across the vast, empty space to a digital

player, connected to a phone.  Simone's pre-recorded opening

remarks (graphically represented on the screen) are almost

completed.

Viktor jumps into the conversation in the nick of time,

speaking through the synthesizer.  As usual, Viktor's voice

is automatically synthesized into the voice of Simone.

The other CAST MEMBERS laugh nervously.

INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

The CAST are hunched over the speakerphone.

They all nod vigorously in agreement.

EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK

VIKTOR removes his own garbage from his soundstage.  A young

cleaning woman, VIVIAN, wheeling a janitor's cart,

tentatively approaches.

Vivian hesitantly hands Viktor a publicity photo of SIMONE.

Viktor is touched by the heartfelt testimony.

INT.  PRODUCTION SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

A green set.  Walls, floor, ceiling -- all green.  A FULL

CAST shoots HAL, dressed in a futuristic suit, tentatively

crossing the green expanse.

Hal pauses, looks longingly, then impulsively dashes forward.

Hal passionately embraces thin air and wrestles it to the

ground.

Hal freezes.  VIKTOR runs from behind the camera and

confronts Hal on the green floor.

Hal, dumbfounded, tentatively touches the non-existent wall.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT

Viktor digitally adds SIMONE standing beside a sportscar with

HAL in a scene from "Eternity Forever".  He works on her

close up.

Viktor hits STOP and Simone freezes.  Viktor brings up a menu

and chooses from a range of "EMOTIONAL OPTIONS".

He fine-tunes SIMONE's performance -- sliding a cursor on a

performance axis from "BROAD" to "SUBTLE".

Simone freezes again.  Viktor make another adjustment.

Simone's tears retreat into her eyes.

She repeats the line.  Viktor mimes the performance.

Simone FREEZES.

Viktor returns SIMONE to her neutral background.

"To Vivian.  Love, Simone" -- VIKTOR writes on the publicity

shot.  He applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo.

Viktor wipes his mouth and looks to SIMONE on his screen --

she is waiting patiently, as usual.

Simone doesn't appear convinced.

He turns to a copy of "The Echo".  A photo of Viktor at the

gate of his Malibu home.  "SIMONE HELD CAPTIVE - Self

proclaimed Svengali Keeps Star Out Of Limelight".  Viktor

puts Simone to sleep and picks up a briefcase.

INT.  HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

VIKTOR, briefcase in hand, strides through the lobby of an

opulent hotel.  He approached the CONCIERGE.

The Concierge straightens as he recognizes Viktor from a copy

of "Variety".  Headline: "Taransky Rides Ingenue's Coat-Tails

To Three Picture Deal".

As Viktor departs, the Concierge holds the registration card

to the mirror.

ENOMIS becomes SIMONE.

The Concierge picks up his phone.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

VIKTOR enters the hotel suite.  We see a montage of scenes --

Viktor revelling in his masquerade.

A)  VIKTOR pulls down the covers of a bed and rolls around in

B)  VIKTOR sprays cologne in the bed.

C)  VIKTOR tosses skimpy lingerie on the floor of the closet.

D)  VIKTOR eats several candy bars from the mini-bar.

E)  VIKTOR puts one of his own movies in the DVD player.

F)  VIKTOR writes a note on the bedside pad.

G)  In the bathroom, shower running, VIKTOR attempts to open

H)  VIKTOR cuts a lock of "faux" hair from a Simone wig and

I)  VIKTOR shakes open a bag of toiletries, the toothbrush

J)  VIKTOR looks through the drapes of the hotel window -- a

K)  VIKTOR shines a lamp against a doll casting a life-size

L)  VIKTOR writes a message in lipstick on the mirror -- "I

VIKTOR is interrupted by a knock on the door.  He looks at

his watch.

Viktor smiles.

EXT.  HOTEL - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT

VIKTOR stands at the rear entrance of the hotel with a leggy

YOUNG WOMAN wearing a coat over her head.  A HOTEL DOORMAN

keeps back the growing horde of REPORTERS.

Viktor's limousine waits at the curb.  The coated woman

starts towards the car but Viktor holds her back.

Viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car,

providing a perfect albeit restricted photo-op for the

paparazzi.

The car door slams shut as the pack descends.  MAX SAYER and

MILTON are amongst the frustrated reporters.  The limo

screeches away.  A POLICE MOTORCYCLIST prevents anyone

following.

The frustrated REPORTERS assess their efforts.

INT.  MISS ENOMIS'S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

MAX SAYER pays off the CONCIERGE.  His assistant, MILTON,

begins to collect "evidence" of the celebrity -- dusting for

fingerprints, etc.  Max rubs pencil into the impression on

the bedside notepad revealing the message -- "The meaning of

life is that it ends".

Milton and the Concierge depart.

Max is alone.  He looks around the room.

A)  MAX enters the bathroom.  He picks up a drinking glass

B)  MAX examines the wet soap from the shower and also places

C)  MAX picks up the used toothbrush, puts it to his lips

D)  MAX gently places his hands on the toilet seat.

E)  MAX enters the bedroom.  He carefully removes a slip from

F)  Finally, MAX kneels and gazes at "Simone's" unmade bed.

INT.  HALLWAY - OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

MILTON, ear pressed against the door, tries to listen inside.

INT.  VIKTOR TARANSKY'S LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

VIKTOR and the COATED WOMAN have finally left the PAPARAZZI

in their wake.  Viktor gently removes the coat from over her

head.

Although the woman is impossible beautiful, she is not

Simone.  FAITH is Simone's latest stand-in and decoy.  Viktor

and Faith are still pressed together against one side of the

limousine.

Neither Viktor nor Faith seem inclined to move from their

intimate position.

Their lips are now tantalizingly close.

INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT

VIKTOR'S HEAD hits the sofa in his living room, closely

followed by FAITH on top of him.

Faith tears at his clothes and her own, ravenous.  Viktor

hardly resists.  In the midst of the wild caresses, Faith

murmurs in his ear.

Viktor freezes.

As Viktor ponders the question, Faith begins to do Simone's

deathbed speech from "Sunrise, Sunset".

Viktor gets up from the sofa, leaving the frustrated Faith to

straighten her clothes.

EXT.  FUTURISTIC LANDSCAPE - "ETERNITY FOREVER" - DAY

The finished scene with SIMONE and HAL plays ON A SCREEN.

INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY

VIKTOR watches the rough cut of "ETERNITY FOREVER" with

ELAINE and daughter, LAINEY.  As usual, they are mesmerized

by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE.  The scene ends.  The

light go up.

Viktor is shocked, busted.  He covers it with a laugh.

Elaine looks at Viktor for an explanation.

EXT.  STUDIO LOT - NIGHT

VIKTOR escorts ELAINE and LAINEY to Elaine's car parked

outside the theater.

Elaine and Viktor linger a moment outside the car.

Both look to Lainey.  From inside the car Lainey watches her

parents.

They instinctively kiss, more affectionate than before.

However, their embrace is interrupted by a click of a camera

shutter from a nearby bush.

The PHOTOGRAPHER has gone but so has the mood.

Elaine climbs into her car and drives away.

EXT.  PREMIERE - DUSK

The premiere for "ETERNITY FOREVER" is everything VIKTOR had

hoped for "SUNRISE, SUNSET".  Red carpet, klieg lights

searching the sky, screaming FANS and PAPARAZZI.

A limousine pulls up, door opens and VIKTOR steps out.  The

crowd screams with excitement.

Viktor waves.  Am expectancy in the crowd -- people crane

their necks, waiting for someone else to step out of the open

car door... but nothing.  The door shuts.  A disappointed

murmer.  The limo drives off.

VIKTOR walks down the carpet to little fanfare.

Other reporters force their way into the interview.

However, the reporter's attention has strayed.

The CAMERAS pivot away from Viktor.  Screen idol, HARRY

EPSON, is walking up the carpet.

Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the

carpet.

VIKTOR watches him go, flabbergasted.

EXT.  PREMIERE PARTY - NIGHT

A packed, glitzy party.  VIKTOR enters without an escort.

Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely

alone.

He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KENT,

schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.

Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small

pocket camera.  Elaine is unaware of the shot.

Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him.

Viktor picks up a drink from the bar.  A DRUNK WOMAN, perched

unsteadily on a nearby barstool, is knocking back Jack

Daniels.  She accidentally brushes one of her discarded

glasses off the bar.  Viktor catches it.

A HAND taps Viktor on the shoulder.  HAL stands there

accompanied by his "Eternity Forever" co-star, MAC.

Mac spots the two glasses in Viktor's hands -- one glass

lipstick-smeared.

Far across the party, a WOMAN, with a Simone-type hairstyle,

her back to us, is standing at the edge of a fountain.

Several nearby GUESTS, including ELAINE, overhear.  They talk

over each other.

The rumor races through the party like wild-fire.  The GUESTS

surge towards the fountain in a wave of mindless adoration.

The Simone lookalike herself spins around.

She gets knocked into the fountain.  Several other GUESTS

also fall in the stampede.

Back at the bar, the BARMAN, autograph book in hand, deserts

his station.  Viktor is left alone with the drunk woman.

LOCAL TV NEWS

The limousines outside the hotel ballroom have been replaced

with ambulances.  PARAMEDICS tend to GUESTS, bloodied and

battered in the stampede caused by Simone's "appearance".

CUTS of interviews with VARIOUS bruised GUESTS.

We return to the live shot of the ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER.

EXT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY

Max Sayer's car is parked outside of the Echo Building.

INT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY

In the ECHO war room, MAX SAYER is agitated.  He paces back

and forth, railing at a table of cowering STAFFERS.

MILTON holds up a glass taken from the hotel.

Max ponders the revelation.

MILTON hesitates, questioning his journalistic ethics.

CLOSE UP on The Echo magazine -- "CIRCULATION - 12 MILLION".

EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY

"MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF SIMONE!" -- Is the

headline on the cover of The ECHO.  VIKTOR is reading the

magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot.

He looks up to see several studio carts parked outside his

soundstage.  A group of STUDIO EXECUTIVES, led by ELAINE, is

trying to break into the "CLOSED SET".  VIKTOR runs towards

the door, throwing himself between the door and the

executives.

Viktor glares at the SECURITY GUARD who shrugs weakly.

Elaine and the executives are not convinced, they overpower

Viktor.

Too late.  Elaine and the suits force the lock and enter.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

ELAINE and the EXECUTIVES stop in their tracks -- confronted

with the surreal sight of the lone computer station in the

vast soundstage.  A desperate VIKTOR catches up with them.

Elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing

smile.

Viktor lowers his head, resigned to his fate.

Viktor looks up.

Viktor seizes on the opportunity.

The Executives are taken aback by the shocking revelation.

Viktor shrugs modestly.

Satisfied, the Executives make their way out of the

soundstage.

Viktor and Elaine are left alone.

The photograph shows ELAINE, slightly inebriated at the

premiere, SIMONE standing slightly behind her.

Viktor watches Elaine make her way back to her studio cart.

Viktor realizes he is still holding a copy of the National

ECHO -- the headline, "MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF

SIMONE"!  Accompanied by a photo of intrepid reporter MAX

SAYER.

INT.  SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

An unattended shopping cart, at the end of the frozen foods

aisle, begins to mysteriously roll towards us.

We discover VIKTOR, pulling the cart with fishing line, while

at the same time shooting it with a video camera.

INT.  SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Viktor's home video of the shopping cart plays on a TV.

However, now SIMONE is pushing the cart.  She wears

sunglasses, her hair in curlers under a scarf.  Simone takes

a Swanson Chicken Pot Pie out of a cabinet... then a box of

cereal off a display.

INT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY

MAX SAYER watches the video in his office, enraptured.  He

rewinds the tape and replays the moment.

Assistant MILTON enters.  He looks ill.

Max's head snaps around.

Max coughs.

A TV

The opening credits to "FRANK BRAND LIVE", a global cable

show plays against a starscape -- images of famous

politicians and world leaders interviewed by Frank.

INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY

ELAINE, KENT and LAINEY watch the TV interview in Elaine's

mansion with eager anticipation.

INT.  MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY

MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON are also glued to their set.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

Casually tacked up on the monitor is the MILLION DOLLAR CHECK

from The ECHO.

VIKTOR, face and body scanned by the computer, is making a

final test of his equipment.  When he touches his hair, bats

his eyes, moves his hands -- so does Simone.

VIKTOR frantically tests several different backgrounds behind

SIMONE from a library of images.  Rainforest.  Desert.  Ritzy

hotel suite.  Moonscape.  Factory.

He settles on the desert location.

He also make a last-second change to Simone's wardrobe --

selecting "TOO-TIGHT SWEATER".

INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT

FRANK BRAND talks to camera.

The just-completed image of SIMONE appears on Brand's

monitor.

INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY

KENT, referring to Simone, forgetting or not caring that

Elaine is in the room.

LAINEY shoots her mother's boyfriend a withering look.  She

gets up and leaves the room.

During the interview we cut between Frank Brand's studio,

Viktor's soundstage and various viewer locations including

Elaine's mansion, Max Sayer's office and various worldwide

locations --

A)  A lone AFGHANI SHEPHERD gazing at a Watchman.

B)  A JAPANESE COUPLE watching TV in a capsule hotel room.

C)  A CATHOLIC CARDINAL watching TV in the Vatican.

INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT

VIKTOR is in his element, his effeminate gestures

frighteningly convincing.

IE.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY

LAINEY has turned her back on the TV screen, preferring to

look through a book.

Lainey regards the name written on the inside page -- "Viktor

Taransky".

INT.  MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY

TV playing in the background, MAX and MILTON are hurriedly

leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps.

INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT

INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY

ELAINE's face drops, slightly hurt.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

VIKTOR accidentally taps his finger on the keyboard in his

excitement -- the cursor aimed at "TEARS" command.  SIMONE'S

EYES start to well with tears -- a tear spills from her eye.

Viktor notices, quickly withdrawing his finger -- his

startled expression instantly imitated by Simone.

INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT

Frank nods sagely.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

The smile is suddenly wiped off VIKTOR's face by a blinking

alert:

The pixels that form SIMONE start to break up.  Curiously, it

is only Simone and not the background that is disintegrating.

INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

VIKTOR speaks again, his voice suddenly deeper.

In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug.  The feed goes

blank on Frank Brand's screen.

VIKTOR slumps over his computer in exhaustion.  Since SIMONE

is still synced to his movements, the partially de-pixelated

Simone also slumps.

Viktor's cell phone rings.  Viktor picks up.

He remembers at the last second to switch off his voice

synthesizer.

INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY

We cut between the two sides of the conversation -- ELAINE on

the phone, KENT still watching post-interview analysis on the

TV.

An anxious beat.

A pause.

Elaine hangs up.  Lainey approaches.

Lainey, coming to her father's defense, glancing at the

Nietzsche book in her hand.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

VIKTOR watches SIMONE on screen.  He is unusually anxious.

As usual SIMONE is wearing a skimpy, provocative outfit as

she awaits instructions on the screen.  For some reason

Viktor becomes irritated by the image.

He hits a button.  A thick WOOL COAT clicks over her body.

EXT.  NEW MEXICO DESERT - MORNING

The ECHO newscar streaks through the bronze and purple

desert.  MAX and his assistant MILTON emerge from the car.

Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND

interview.  He compares her desert location to the one in

front of him.

Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is

now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn.

Max and Milton are mystified -- they look back at the photo.

Max shakes his head, deeply concerned.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT

VIKTOR has transformed his soundstage into a one-man

publicity machine.  The floor is littered with photographs of

SIMONE in various states of dress and undress.

Using a sophisticated Photoshop computer program, VIKTOR

constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine

spreads -- "Time", "People", "Us", "Life", "Popular

Mechanics".

Viktor calls up a "DANCE OPTION".  Choosing from a HULA

DANCER, a BELLY DANCER and a CLASSICAL BALLERINA, he removes

Simone's head and places it on the body of the ballerina.

She begins to dance for him.

He uses a program to construct childhood photographs of

SIMONE and other childhood memorabilia.

He employs backgrounds from numerous on-line library sources.

With a quick cut and paste he is able to place Simone on a

beach in San Tropez or a bicycle factory in Calcutta.

INT.  ELAINE'S OFFICE - STUDIO - DAY

ELAINE watches TV in her office.  She cannot change channels

without finding Simone sitting in a chair giving generic

answers.

INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON ELAINE'S TV)

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT

VIKTOR inspects a cut-out photograph of Simone in "ETERNITY

FOREVER" costume.  He speaks to the photo.

EXT.  FASTFOOD RESTAURANT - DAY

The photograph of Simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink

cup -- a pyramid of cups promoting "ETERNITY FOREVER" Happy

Meals.  Beneath the plastic pyramid is a SIMONE action figure

in a convertible.

INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - DAY

Screams the banner headline in "Variety".

Shouts the "Hollywood Reporter".

The trade papers sit on the coffee table in front of VIKTOR

who reclines on a leather sofa, watching TV, gazing lovingly

at Simone.

INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S TV)

INT.  BOOKSTORE - DAY

Various book titles are on display:

EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

A banner in a window reads.  "In Stock: SIMONE'S EASY-WEAR

FASHION".  Mannequins model the clothes.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

We focus on the screen where VIKTOR types in instructions:

A list of the Number 1 hits for the last forty years promptly

appears on the screen along with photographs of the

artists --

PATSY CLINE, ELLA FITZGERALD, ARETHA FRANKLIN, JANICE JOPLIN,

CAROL KING, WHITNEY HOUSTON, MADONNA, etc.  Beneath the title

of each song is a graphic representation of the music --

"PITCH" and "RESONANCE".

Viktor presses a button: "MORPH".  The audio waves converge.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

VIKTOR, wearing headphones, records his composite pop song.

As usual when he sings into his microphone, Simone also

sings.  The catchy song is titled: "(If You Can't Believe In

Yourself) Believe In Me".

SIMONE APPEARS IN A MUSIC VIDEO.

INT.  RECORD STORE - DAY

The video for SIMONE's song plays on the video wall inside

the record store.  TEENAGE GIRLS, buying CD's, dance

adoringly in front of the screen, unaware that they are

gyrating to the vocals of a middle-aged man.

INSERT - "(If You Can't Believe In Yourself) Believe In Me"

shoots up the Billboard charts.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

CLOSE UP on the name "SIMONE" painted on the stern of a

luxury yacht.

VIKTOR is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last

a moment to savor his success.  Simone's hit single plays on

the yacht's stereo.  He looks at peace.

EXT.  MARINA - DAY

A TOURIST has his arm around SIMONE, having his photograph

taken.  However, we discover that the Simone is only a

lifesize cardboard cutout used by a STREET VENDOR to sell

snapshots.  He also has cardboard cutouts of the POPE and

ELVIS.

MAX SAYER and MILTON walk by.

Tying up his boat, VIKTOR's mood is abruptly shattered by the

sight of Max and Milton walking down the pier towards him.

Viktor freezes.

Max compares the shot to one of the current desert location

with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain.

Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of faking

the background.

Viktor flinches at the remark.

Viktor pauses, considering the threat.

Viktor walks away leaving Max confused.

The breeze whips the photos of SIMONE out of Max's hands and

into the sea.

INT.  CONCERT STADIUM - DUSK

A vast, empty stadium.  On the stage, a lone microphone.

VIKTOR approaches, gazing out at the vast arena.  Several

PROMOTERS and TECHNICIANS join him.

Viktor nods.

The Promoter glancing to the area in front of the stage,

where a barrier has been erected.

Viktor hands each man a headshot of SIMONE signed with a

kiss.

EXT.  STADIUM - NIGHT

In the shadow of the enormous stadium sits a control

truck/tour bus, satellite dishes on the roof -- the lights

from the laser-show inside the arena play off the truck.  The

control truck shakes from the stomping of the crowd.

The door to the truck is marked, "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation

Tour.  NO ENTRY".

INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

VIKTOR sits alone at the mixing panel of a control truck.  On

his monitors, a sea of humanity, chanting.

Viktor produces the "SIMULATION ONE" hard-drive from his

jacket pocket and inserts it into the computer.

SIMONE appears on the monitor.

Simone's hair rapidly grows in a number of styles, eyelashes

grow and are trimmed, eyeshadow of various shades paints

across the lids.

Viktor tries several outfits on Simone -- the clothes

appearing to fabricate themselves on her body.  He settles

for the most provocative outfit.

Finger poised over the keyboard, Viktor glances to a monitor

showing --

INT.  STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT

ELAINE and LAINEY amongst the crowd, clapping their hands,

stomping their feet and chanting.

INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

He scrolls to a program, marked "HOLOGRAM" and pushes the

"ENTER" key.

INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT

Smoke fills the stage.  A strobe light show plays.  A booming

ANNOUNCER is heard.

A spotlight falls on the solitary figure of Simone, standing

alone on the stage with a guitar over her shoulder (the only

accompaniment) -- dwarfed by the huge stage.  However, on

closer inspection, the spotlight is actually a laser beam

creating a hologram.  Clouds of smoke and strobe lighting aid

the illusion.

The only clear view of Simone for the audience is provided by

the enormous video screens on either side of the stage.  The

CROWD stares up at the jumbotrons, blissfully unaware that

they are watching a pre-recorded event.  Some watch the event

on portable TVs.

INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

CLOSE UP on the computer screen.  VIKTOR scrolls down a list

of options -- "... HOUSTON, MIAMI, NEW YORK, L.A...."

He selects "L.A.".

The crowd roars its approval.

INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT

SIMONE -- her voice a seamless blend of several DIVAS --

begins to sing her hit song, "(If You Can't Believe In

Yourself) Believe In Me".  A verse of the song is sung in

perfect Spanish.

EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT/DAY

A)  On a jumbotron in Tokyo SIMONE's concert plays LIVE.

B)  On a TV set on a West African beach, children dance to

C)  On a computer in a Bombay taxi, the driver and his

INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

VIKTOR's face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied

crowd gazing up at the jumbotron -- singing along, many in

tears, overcome with emotion -- holding cigarette lighters

aloft.  For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry --

the grand illusionist.  Viktor is at the height of his

powers.

He snaps back to reality just in time to notice that the

Simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone

stand.

He adjusts the beam -- the rapturous crowd, transfixed by the

TV screen, apparently fails to notice.

INT.  STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT

We focus on a face in the crowd -- MAX SAYER.  His

journalistic assignment temporarily forgotten, Max is singing

along and waving his arms, tears rolling down his face, swept

up in the moment.

INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT

SIMONE finishes her final number.

EXT.  STADIUM - EXIT - NIGHT

A bin contains dozens of confiscated cameras and binoculars.

FANS exit the stadium through a tunnel.

S-I-M-O-N-E is spelt out on the bare chests of six TEENAGE

BOYS.  Other FANS wear "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation Tour"

T-shirts and carry posters.  Several CONCERT GOERS speak to a

TV NEWS CREW.

INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

The chanting crowd can be heard exiting.  VIKTOR, wearing

lipstick is hastily signing a pile of souvenir programs with

Simone's signature kiss.

He is interrupted by a knock at the door.  Viktor irritably

opens it.

EXT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

ELAINE and LAINEY stand at the foot of the trailer, a

SECURITY GUARD nearby.

Regarding Viktor closely, Elaine's smile evaporates.

Viktor is confused by their reaction.  Elaine yanks Lainey

away.

Viktor waves disconcertedly.

As he returns to the trailer, Viktor catches sight of his

lipstick-smeared mouth in the mirror on the inside of the

trailer door.  He slams the side of the trailer in

frustration.

INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - NIGHT

ELAINE paces back and forth in front of her TV showing re-

runs of the SIMONE concert.  KENT cannot take his eyes off

the screen.

Kent switches off the TV.

Behind the open door, we find LAINEY eavesdropping.

EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - BEACH - DAY

VIKTOR, deep in thought, stands at the water's edge, staring

at the breaking waves.  LAINEY joins him.

An awkward silence.

Viktor is confused.

Viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter, so much wiser than

her years.

A car horn sounds outside the house.

She exits, leaving Viktor deep in thought.

EXT.  LOS ANGELES FREEWAY - DAY

Milli Vanilli's "GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE" plays on a car

radio.  ELAINE, wearing a red power suit, drives home along

the freeway in bumper-to-bumper traffic.  Her car phone

rings.  She turns down the radio and picks up.

Elaine looks to the inside lane.  SIMONE, wearing sunglasses,

phone to her ear, drives alongside.  Simone waves, somewhat

mechanically.  Elaine waves back.  They keep driving as they

talk.

INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY

The sunglasses-clad SIMONE is a mannequin, seated in the

driver's seat with her left hand on the phone obscuring her

mouth, right hand attached to the steering wheel.

Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side, VIKTOR drives the

car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering

with one hand, occasionally sneaking a glance to the road

ahead.  He speaks on a phone through the Simone synthesizer.

Viktor, losing concentration on his driving, drifts across

his lane, almost striking Elaine's car -- swerving back at

the last second.

Over-correcting his steering, Viktor drifts into the next

lane, dangerously close to a pick-up truck that has to swerve

to avoid him.

Viktor's car swerves to the right.  Elaine looks back in her

rearview mirror, concerned.

Elaine just misses the sight of VIKTOR's car rear-ending the

truck in front of him.

EXT.  FREEWAY SHOULDER - LATER IN THE DAY

VIKTOR anxiously watches a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN writing up the

fender-bender.  However, the Patrolman is more interested in

the Simone mannequin.

INT.  ACADEMY AWARDS - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

VIKTOR, in his tuxedo, sits in the front row of the packed

auditorium beside an empty seat -- "RESERVED for SIMONE".

ELAINE and LAINEY sit alongside -- LOTUS and MAC nearby.

HAL stands at the transparent plastic podium with the "Best

Actress" envelope.

Hal tears the envelope's seal, momentarily confused as he

reads the name.

The AUDIENCE gasps.

The audience cheers enthusiastically, but Hal stills their

applause.

The audience erupts.  Viktor accepts the congratulations of

those around him.

The screen flickers to life.

ON SCREEN - A DESOLATE WASTELAND - DAY

SIMONE sits in a director's chair in the desolate wasteland

location chosen by Viktor.

The CROWD applauds wildly.

LAINEY is puzzled.  She leans over to Viktor.

Viktor glances to the "Simone" sign beside him.  The blood

drains from his face.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - MORNING

On the monitor, SIMONE reads the forgotten line from the

speech.

VIKTOR, still in his tuxedo, stares at SIMONE on the screen.

He holds the text of Simone's acceptance speech in his hands.

Simone stares back at him blankly.

A copy of VARIETY is slid under the soundstage door.  The

front page headline, "NO THANK YOU - Simone Snubs Taransky At

Oscars".

INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - NIGHT

VIKTOR pulls up to the gate of his Malibu home.  MAX is

standing outside next to his car.

EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT

VIKTOR also spies an OLD WOMAN in a wheelchair sitting beside

the car, MILTON closeby.  Viktor stops at the gate and

reluctantly exits his car.

The old woman appears drugged, stares into space.

Max produces a shot of SIMONE at the Oscars and holds it in

front of the old lady.

Viktor produces his own driver's license and holds it in

front of the old lady.

Max hastily steps between Viktor and the Old Lady.

Viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity.

Viktor drives into his home.  Max, very confused, stares at

the old lady.

EXT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

VIKTOR escorts LAINEY, blindfolded, around the corner of his

soundstage.  He removes the blindfold.  From Lainey's point-

of-view we see the sportscar Simone drove in "ETERNITY

FOREVER" -- the car tied with a bow.

Lainey averts her gaze.

Viktor watches Lainey depart towards the studio gates.

INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

VIKTOR leans on his desk, still reflecting on LAINEY's

remarks.  JANE enters.

Viktor nods distractedly.  Jane shows in NICOLA ANDERS.

Viktor offers Nicola a seat, staring at her as if he has

never truly looked at her before -- she has a quality of

Simone.

She hands Viktor a peace offering -- a large jar of Mike &

Ike candy, including cherry.

Viktor continues to stare.

Nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down.

She approaches Viktor, standing close to him, playing the

scene to him -- an immediate intimacy.

Nicola immediately breaks character.

Viktor is mesmerized -- he has fallen back in love with

flesh.

Viktor sits back down and stares out of the window.

Viktor does not reply.  Nicola quietly leaves.

INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY

The front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large

photograph of SIMONE giving her acceptance speech via

satellite.  However, ELAINE is gazing at a small inset

picture of VIKTOR, HERSELF and LAINEY arriving at the Oscar

Ceremony.

Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse.

EXT.  SWIMMING POOL - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S SCREEN)

Old home video of ELAINE.  She is in a garden by a swimming

pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera.

Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera

operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a

kiss to the camera.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

While the ever-seductive SIMONE waits patiently on-screen for

Viktor's instructions, VIKTOR is gazing at the smaller

monitor -- the home video of ELAINE.

Viktor freezes the tape.  Elaine appears particularly

beautiful.

Viktor electronically cuts out Elaine's mannerism and morphs

it into Simone.  Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same

dazzling smile.

INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

At her desk, JANE is busy trying to mimic Simone's hairstyle

as she talks on the phone.

VIKTOR enters the office.

Jane hurriedly hangs up.

Jane tries to conceal her interest.  As soon as Viktor exits

the office, JANE picks up the phone.

We reveal VIKTOR, outside the door, eavesdropping on his

assistant, pleased she has taken the bait.

INT.  VIKTOR'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

VIKTOR dims the lights, plays "mood" music.  The doorbell

rings.

He checks himself in the mirror.  In the reflection, he spies

an autographed photo of HIMSELF with his arm around SIMONE.

He hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door.

ELAINE stands there.

Elaine is over-dressed for her supposed errand.

Elaine takes a seat on the sofa.  Viktor hands her a glass of

wine and sits beside her -- close.

They both knock back their wine in one long gulp, both

apparently in need of courage.

Viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her.

They kiss.  Elaine breaks the kiss, suddenly consumed with

doubt.

Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage.

A pause.  His words hang in the air.

Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Viktor

alone in his house.

INT.  VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

A hung-over VIKTOR enters his office.  Suddenly, he stops and

confronts the standee of SIMONE.

JANE stares in shock.  She discreetly exits.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, smiling venomously at

SIMONE.  He begins to digitally disrobe Simone.

MONTAGE:

A)  Peering through a gap in the drapes of his Malibu house,

B)  The ECHO headline screams, "SIMONE'S HARD CORE PAST" and

C)  Inside a theater, VIKTOR hovers by the door, smirking.

D)  A pretentious FILM CRITIC talks to camera, a film poster

E)  In his soundstage, VIKTOR moves a slider that adds

G)  VIKTOR driving along a city street, suddenly slams on his

Realizing what he's said, a thought comes into his eyes.

EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY

An inscription on a headstone reads:

VIKTOR kneels at HANK's grave.  He places a bunch of flowers

there.

A thought occurs to Viktor.  He slowly rises from behind

Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK

A sad but resolute VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor,

SIMONE's face full screen.

He speaks into the voice synthesizer, Simone's face

automatically speaking the words he speaks -- the final time

he puts his words in her mouth.

He switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice.

On the screen, Simone is on the verge of tears.

Viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked, "PLAGUE - Ver.

8.1".  He places the disc in the machine.

Viktor sees that Simone is crying.  He touches a tear on his

own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own.

Viktor hesitates -- a moment of doubt -- then presses

"ENTER".  The image of SIMONE's face gradually begins to

deconstruct -- pixel by pixel -- as the virus takes hold.

The pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen

like dust.  Finally, the dust is blown away in a single

digital breath.

For a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on

his own desk.

Viktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen.

His hard-drive now corrupted, he picks up his original disc

marked, "SIMULATION ONE".

He tosses this disc into a steamer trunk he has loaded with

hundreds of discs relating to Simone's software.  He shuts

the lid and begins dragging the trunk towards the door.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA BAY - DUSK

Viktor's yacht sits at anchor in the glassy waters of Santa

Monica Bay -- "SIMONE" written on the stern.

VIKTOR manhandles the trunk to the railing.  A mournful pause

-- then he heaves it over the side.  The trunk sinks like a

stone.

Heart heavy, Viktor stares into the inky depths.

EXT.  STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY

A throng of REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS.  A somber VIKTOR

enters and takes a seat in front of a forest of microphones.

A gasp from the audience.  Then, an explosion of anguish.

At the back of the room are MAX SAYER and MILTON.  They are

frozen in grief, a tear spills from Max's eye.

A MONTAGE OF SCENES:

A)  "SIMON GONE - FADE TO BLACK", reads the cover of Variety.

B)  The announcement of her death appears on local TV news

C)  A carpet of bouquets and notes of commiseration several

D)  In a remote Mongolian encampment MONGOL HORSEMEN crowd

E)  The HEARSE carrying Simone's "body" and the funeral

F)  The same television picture is playing on a television

EXT.  GRAVESIDE - CEMETERY - DAY

We tilt up from Hank's headstone to an ornate mausoleum on an

island in a lake.

Simone's coffin is ferried across a bridge by PALLBEARERS

from the studio.  Numerous MOURNERS follow behind.

VIKTOR, ELAINE and a curiously dry-eyed LAINEY walk behind

the coffin.

The coffin reaches the steps of the marble mausoleum.  A

PRIEST, RABBI, and a BUDDHIST MONK turn to Viktor.  He nods

and they start to carry the coffin towards the door.

However, the coffin is suddenly stopped by a POLICE OFFICER.

A SECOND POLICE OFFICER begins to jimmy open the lid.  The

coffin lid is pulled back.  Inside is a life-sized cardboard

standee of Simone from "ETERNITY FOREVER".

The MOURNERS gasp.  Everyone looks to Viktor.

INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

A SERIES OF POLICE INTERVIEWS:

JANE sits in the interview room, describing Viktor's assault

on the standee.

A)  MAX SAYER, distraught and weeping.

B)  NICOLA gives a statement.

INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

VIKTOR sits in an interrogation room in a sea of SIMONE.

Magazine covers, cosmetics advertisements, publicity shots,

interviews, website print-outs, photographs and report cards

from her fictitious childhood are plastered on the walls,

stacks of film cans and tapes of her numerous movie and

television appearances.

Viktor, sensing his sarcasm, does not reply.

The Detective raises a window-blind to reveal a next door

room where the OLD WOMAN from the rest home is being

interviewed.

The OLD WOMAN glances up and sees all the photos of Simone

through the window.

The Detective abruptly lowers the blind.  Viktor rolls his

eyes at the Detective's theatrics.  He is suddenly enraged.

The Detectives sadly shake their heads.

The Detective places a tape, marked "EXHIBIT A" in a video

machine.

He plays a tape showing --

EXT.  MARINA PIER - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)

VIKTOR dragging his trunk from his car down the pier to his

yacht.

The Detective freezes the tape.

EXT.  BOAT - SANTA MONICA BAY - DAY

VIKTOR sits handcuffed on a POLICE BOAT with the DETECTIVE

and his LAWYER.  DIVERS surface with the steamer trunk.

Viktor's face lights up.

The trunk is winched aboard.  However, as it lowers onto the

deck, we see the latch has broken and the lid is ajar.  All

eyes stare inside the trunk as the lid is lifted.  Apart from

a scrawny piece of kelp -- empty.

All eyes follow the diver's gaze to several SHARK FINS in the

water.

CLOSE UP ON FRONT PAGE OF L.A. TIMES:

The newspaper is being read by Viktor's LAWYER, sitting

opposite Viktor in his cell.  VIKTOR is numb -- the

likelihood of conviction slowly dawning on him.

INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT

A FIGURE sits at Viktor's computer.  LAINEY.  She scrolls

through Viktor's files.  All empty.

Lainey sighs.  ELAINE paces behind her.

Elaine continues to pace as Lainey works.

Elaine regards her daughter curiously.

Lainey finally tries another file.  She presses "EJECT".  The

"PLAGUE" disc spits out of the machine.

Lainey smiles at her mother.

INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - POLICE CELL - DAY

VIKTOR sits in his cell, arms crossed, quietly seething,

while his LAWYER lays out his trial strategy.

VIKTOR, fuming throughout this, suddenly explodes.

The Lawyer spins around guiltily.  The Detective stands

outside the cell, clearly overhearing the confession.

Viktor, resigned to his fate, couldn't care less.

The Detective switches on the TV set hanging outside the

cell.  VBC is playing -- "BREAKING NEWS" --

INT.  TELEVISION STUDIO - "VBC" - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)

A NEWS ANCHOR appears.

EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)

The brief clip shows the front page of the L.A. Times --

headlines: "HOLLYWOOD SUSPENDS FILMING IN MEMORY OF SIMONE"

and "D.A. Seeks Death Penalty for Taransky".

The reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself -- SIMONE,

on the studio lot, looking more beautiful than ever.  She

winks to the camera.

The TV is switched off.  Viktor stares at the screen, trying

to take it in.

When he looks back to the Detective, he discovers him holding

the cell door open.

EXT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - DAY

A throng of REPORTERS, PAPARAZZI and ONLOOKERS parts like a

sea for VIKTOR, released from custody.  One placard reads,

"ASK JESUS TO SAVE YOU NOW".  He is escorted to a waiting

limousine where he is met by ELAINE and LAINEY.  He hugs them

both.

INT.  LIMOUSINE - DAY

VIKTOR sits beside ELAINE.  LAINEY sits opposite, studying

her laptop computer.  Outside the car, REPORTERS are pressed

against the glass.

Viktor shrugs resignedly, savoring his freedom.

Once again his daughter's words have a ghastly ring of truth.

Viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually

forces its way through the reporters.

He recognizes MAX and MILTON amongst the mob.  Max has

hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the

window --

"WILL PAY $ FOR EXCLUSIVE".  Viktor looks away.

INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - DAY

FRANK BRAND conducts a remote interview with SIMONE who

appears as usual on a television monitor.

Frank nods sympathetically.

SIMONE holds up a beautiful BABY BOY to camera.

On Frank Brand's monitor, the camera pulls back to reveal

VIKTOR, sitting on a sofa -- an idyllic domestic scene.

INT.  SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

Only we see the set where the interview is being recorded.

VIKTOR is sitting on a sofa against a green screen in his

soundstage, smiling at a woman and child who are not there --

he is alone.

CUT TO BLACK

INT.  CONCERT STADIUM - NIGHT

DURING THE CLOSING CREDITS SIMONE PERFORMS ANOTHER SONG FROM

HER CONCERT TOUR -- "(YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE) A NATURAL

WOMAN".
