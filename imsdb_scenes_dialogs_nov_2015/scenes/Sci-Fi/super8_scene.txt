OVER BLACK WE HEAR THE DULL SOUNDS OF INDUSTRY; A MUFFLED

MASS OF MACHINES, GEARS, STEAM. FADE IN ON:

A SIGN. Twelve feet across. Painted decades earlier, grim-

covered black, white and red. It reads in large 40's era,

hand-painted type, "SAFETY IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN!" Then:

"DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT" and below that, NUMBERS, painted

on hanging metal cards. Four possible digits can hang here,

but there are currently three: "784."

SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a

forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. Removes

the "4" from its hooks. Then removes the "8." Then the "7."

Finally, he hangs up a number. "1."

The man LOWERS out of frame as we creep even closer to the

hanging single digit, wondering about the accident... and how

bad it was and the FACTORY SOUNDS GROW DEAFENING -- AND AS IT

BUILDS TO A CRESCENDO, WE CUT TO SILENT BLACKNESS.

EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - PORCH - DAY

Shiny black loafers. Black pants, three inches too long. We

BOOM UP, stopping at a boy's hand reaching into the black

suit jacket pocket. Pulls out a WOMAN'S GOLD NECKLACE with a

LOCKET. He holds the locket. Rubs it gently with his thumb.

CONTINUE TO BOOM UP. We now SEE THE BOY'S FACE.

This is JOE LAMB, 14. On the precarious edge of adulthood. He

looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes.

He moves forward and we PAN, so we're BEHIND HIM NOW. In the

frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest

homes, is a STEEL MILL. Smokestacks and structures. The

lifeblood of this late 70's town.

INT. LAMB LIVING ROOM - DAY

Close on CHARLES' MOTHER AND FATHER, funeral attire. She

looks out of the window sadly; heartsick and concerned.

Behind her, he picks at his plate of food.

But his wife isn't so sure.

Then, BOYS' HUSHED VOICES:

INT. LAMB DINING ROOM - DAY

CHARLES (we'll see him in a moment) LEANS FORWARD, reaching

for food on a buffet table. Charles' leaning has revealed

CARY, a blonde kid in a dark blue sport jacket and tie, and

PRESTON, pale and smart, in a DARK SWEATER:

We now see CHARLES, big and in an ill-fitting BLACK SUIT, and

MARTIN, good looking, in a shirt and tie, at the buffet:

CUT WIDE TO REVEAL that we are in a modest Ohio house in the

year 1979. At a wake. Forty-odd friends and neighbors, darkly

dressed. Quiet discussions. Some crying.

I heard it crushed her

completely. At least keep your voices

A steel beam-- those things

weigh a ton. Literally. If it had been open casket, I

They look up -- in the other room, a dog (mutt, Lucy) has

jumped on a guest, for food. JACKSON LAMB, Joe's father, 42,

black suit, moves to the dog, walks her out of shot.

EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

A WIDE SHOT. A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in

LILLIAN, OHIO. Many cars are parked outside the house,

notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway.

Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit,

now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years.

He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds. No doubt

trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around

his mother's neck. Then a SOUND. Joe looks up. A CAR has

arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR

with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center. Joe watches as

the car sits there for a moment. Then a MAN gets out. Someone

Joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. A man in

his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. He's not exactly

sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been

drinking. This is LOUIS DAINARD.

Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the

porch and inside the house. Joe's eyes glued on the house for

a while. Then he looks back to the locket. He OPENS IT, and

stares at the picture inside (which we do not see). And as he

stares, TEARS come to his eyes.

A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns

toward the house. After a beat, the SOUND of something

BREAKING -- something glass. Then the house BACK DOOR bursts

open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never

forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED

Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad

car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of

freezes as their eyes lock. But Jack's more uncomfortable

And Jack gets into the car and drives away. Joe watches them

drive off. And after a beat, he looks down at the locket

again. Mom's just gone. Finally he CLOSES IT -- and we hear

an oddly LOUD SNAP and our SCREEN GOES BLACK.

Over darkness: APPLAUSE -- then a LONE VOICE: "I want you...

to want me!" DRUMS kick in, CHEAP TRICK BLASTS. CUT TO:

EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

Hundreds of KIDS eagerly leave their last day of school for

the year, winter a memory. GIRLS emphatically embrace each

other good-bye. BOYS run off, just happy to be out. Lots of

"Have a great summer!"

DOLLY WITH Joe, who walks through the crowd alone, backpack

on shoulder.

Suddenly Charles is there, red-faced -- he hands Joe PAGES:

-- I am reading. -- Not carefully. Focus, this

-- Detective Hathaway has a

wife?

They head across the street to the 7-Eleven. Suddenly Cary is

there, a BURN WRAP on his right arm now:

Martin booted all over his

locker, it was the grossest

one yet-- Let Joe focus, he's reading.

After he ate two boxes of

Mike and Ikes-- never seen so

many colors in my life. Will you shut up a minute?

Joe stops. His friends don't. PUSH IN ON HIM --

EXT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY

As they head to the doors:

Shut up. It's for "silent reading."

INT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Joe, Charles and Cary scan the candy aisle.

To the train depot -- did you

not read the scene I just

gave you? Does Alice have a license? Is

Charles swipes the pages from critic Cary.

CHARLES' SUPER 8 MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A MOVIE SCREEN.

SLOWLY PUSH IN ON THE SCREEN: kids earnestly playing adults:

INT. BUILDING 47 - DAY (SUPER 8)

DARKNESS. Then a DOOR OPENS. It's DETECTIVE HATHAWAY (played

by MARTIN), in silhouette. He enters. It's an old WAREHOUSE,

dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with CRATES, old MACHINERY,

CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK. The Detective turns on his

FLASHLIGHT -- aims it -- sweeps it across the space -- the

light HITTING THE LENS for a moment.

The Detective walks through the spooky, dark space. A low,

growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly creepy.

Then: A SOUND -- quick but strange -- slithering -- and the

Detective aims his flashlight -- tense. He watches. Waits. We

see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through THICK

DUST in the air. It's an old office door, ajar.

Hathaway is still. Nervous. Watching the door -- waiting for

it to open... and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a

terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the

Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND --

and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie

DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize

that the Zombie is CARY. Actually, not a bad performance. The

Detective pulls out his GUN -- but the Zombie grabs his wrist

-- they wrestle with the gun -- the Zombie wanting to rip

into Hathaway's neck -- but Hathaway sees three SHARP-TIPPED

NAILS sticking out of an old piece of WOODEN CRATE -- and

after a significant struggle, Hathaway PUSHES THE ZOMBIE BACK

so his head is IMPALED BY THE NAILS -- which we see ENTER HIS

SKULL!!! The Zombie (stuck to the crate via the nails)

SCREAMS AND DIES and just at Hathaway catches his breath THE

IMAGE DIMS AND FREEZES; the projector has just been STOPPED.

We are in:

INT. CHARLES' ROOM - DAY

Board games, books, records, a stereo, toys, and magic. Super

8 film equipment and paraphernalia. Movie ONE SHEETS hang:

CARRIE, HALLOWEEN, EARTHQUAKE and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.

No sports memorabilia. Charles turns on the lights, looks

anxiously at Joe:

As he tosses Joe a SUPER 8 FILMMAKER MAGAZINE:

Jesus, that's what I've been

explaining: in the scene

we're filming tonight, the

wife telling the detecting

she's scared for him, that

she loves him-- Charles!

-- I'M COMING!!!

-- so when he investigates

the zombie stuff you'll be

scares -- you'll feel

something -- because you

don't want him to die because

they love each other! Does

that make sense?

Joe just nods and looks at the magazine.

INT. CHARLES' KITCHEN - DUSK

A hectic FAMILY: Charles' mother cooks. JEN, his smoking hot

17-year-old sister, ANGRILY sets the table where his father

pays bills. Pale 15-year-old sister PEG does a PUZZLE. Twin 9-

YEAR-OLD BOYS bicker over an action figure. TV in the living

room plays a MATCH GAME. Joe and Charles enter.

Disgusted, Jen LOUDLY sets Charles' place as --

Charles grabs a roll.

Joe leaves; Charles' parents share a look of pity for Joe.

EXT. CHARLES' HOUSE - DUSK

An anomalous moment in this small steel town: the sun sets

through the distant trees and it's beautiful, despite the

distant belching SMOKESTACKS. Joe leaves Charles' house and

CROSSES THE STREET to his own. SQUAD CAR in the driveway.

INT. JOE'S HOUSE - DUSK

Joe comes into the kitchen through the BACK DOOR. Lucy the

dog greets him. A TV is head somewhere. NIGHTLY NEWS reports

on the ONGOING CLEAN-UP OF THREE MILE ISLAND. A half-empty

BEER BOTTLE on the table. Joe peeks into the living room --

but no one's there.

Joe looks around for his father. Heads down the hallway.

Stops when he sees something off camera. We HOLD on Joe's

face, sort of quietly stunned.

And we se his POV: Jack, Joe's father, in uniform pants and T-

shirt, sits on the edge of the bathtub, head in his hands,

quietly CRYING.

Joe is stunned, staring at his dad. But he can't look away.

And when he finally starts to head off, Jack looks up. Joe's

mind scrambles for something to say, but Jack sniffles, gets

it together, quick. Puts on a strong face.

Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door.

HOLD ON JOE. Stunned and heartsick.

INT. CAROL'S DINER - NIGHT

Commodores quietly sing "EASY" on the PA. Joe and his father,

in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter. Jack eats a

beef stew and reviews office paperwork, not looking at his

son. Joe eats a grilled cheese, deeply lonely and not even

knowing it.

Jack pulls out a PAMPHLET, and places it on the table:

Joe looks at the pamphlet for HEWITT SPORTS CAMP. Images of

happy, smiling, healthy ATHLETIC KIDS. Not his thing.

Joe looks back at the pamphlet -- his other hand coming up

from under the table -- and Jack sees that Joe is HOLDING HIS

MOTHER'S LOCKET. Jack wants to cry again. He wants to throw

that locket away, out of sight. But he just turns away.

Joe stares at the pamphlet. PUSH IN on the photo of beaming

15-year-old KIDS. Then CUT TO THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME:

INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT

TIGHT ON QUASIMODO; a plastic, painted AURORA model. RACK

FOCUS to the paintbrush that comes into frame -- FOLLOW IT TO

JOE, holding the brush, at his desk, making a model. A boy's

room recently devoid of a mother's oversight; a mess. COMIC

BOOKS and other PLASTIC MODELS, all built and painted by Joe.

CARS and CREATURES and a TRAIN. His bedside CLOCK RADIO

(11:56 PM) quietly plays "BAKER STREET." Then a RADIO SQUAWK -

- Joe grabs a KID'S WALKIE-TALKIE:

Joe turns off the walkie -- and he grabs a small plastic

FISHERMAN'S TACKLE BOX as we HEAR:

EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Midnight. Sitting on the curb with their GEAR and talking

quietly, are Joe, Charles, Martin, Preston and Cary. Martin

dressed in his detecting SUIT. Joe eats from a bag of

Twizzlers.

Well then I totally

sharteezed in my pants. That's exactly what I'm

Joe passes him a Twizzler.

All the boys look. Their faces BRIGHTEN. Headlights. The boys

stand as the car STOPS beside them -- IT'S THE YELLOW BUICK

WITH THE BLACK RACING STRIPE THAT PULLED UP TO JOE'S HOUSE

DURING THE WAKE. But now, sitting in the driver's seat is 14-

year-old ALICE DAINARD. She sees Joe.

-- what? (touch flattered)

Looking away, she's pissed. All the boys in silent wait. She

considers, annoyed. Shakes her head. Finally:

The boys EXCITEDLY SCRAMBLE into the car.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

The Buick crosses the nighttime horizon, leaving the small

town, driving through a rural landscape.

INT. BUICK - NIGHT

Alice drives. The boys shoved in the back with the gear -- in

front Charles struggles with his backpack and camera bags as

he pulls out PAGES, arranging them. With her driving, there's

an unusual, electric energy in the air. Joe eats his

Twizzlers in the back, trying not to stare at Alice.

Cary messes with the radio. Alice moves his hand away.

Alice looks at him in the rear view. Their eyes hold a beat.

She takes the Twizzler he offers and looks back to the road.

EXT. RURAL OHIO - NIGHT

The Buick WOOSHES PAST a solitary KELVIN GAS STATION. The car

dips into the darkness, beneath a blanket of stars.

EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - NIGHT

The Buick pulls up to this small, EMPTY TRAIN STATION in the

middle of, essentially, nowhere. A series of HANGING LIGHTS

illuminates the TRAIN PLATFORM. There's a small office,

currently closed. No one around.

The kids get out of the car.

The boys carry many bags and the tripod.

PLATFORM - Charles looks at the scene through the "lens" he

creates with both hands.

Joe walks past Alive, who watches him. It strikes her that

Joe is Charles' lackey.

EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - PLATFORM - NIGHT

Martin sits alone with his copy of the pages, quietly reading

and memorizing his lines.

Cary grabs his paper and throws it to the wind, sending

Martin running after it.

INT. PLATFORM

Preston sets up the lights as Cary arrives to show him his

backpack full of FIRECRACKERS:

Cary takes off. Martin returns with his paper.

EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - PLATFORM - EDGE OF PLATFORM - NIGHT

Charles writes in his notebook. He starts to get up...

He gets up to reveal Joe putting make-up on Alice. He walks

over to Martin, Cary and Preston. Charles and Martin AD LIB.

TIGHT ON JOE'S TACKLE BOX, which opens. Inside is an

assortment of MAKE-UPS, sponges, cotton balls, brushes, derma

wax, spirit gum, and a large jar of FAKE BLOOD. Joe is

preparing to make up Alice, who sits in front of him,

watching carefully as Joe prepares BASE MAKE-UP on a sponge.

He looks to her. A beat.

Alice shakes her head: nope. Joe starts stippling the make-up

onto her face. He is now, via sponge, touching the face of a

girl he's admired for some time. After a beat:

And she looks at him. Almost as if she were looking for

something. Joe stops stippling. The tension is almost too

much for him to bear.

He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up. She does. Joe

starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something

provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes

closed. Then, PRE-LAP:

EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - PLATFORM - NIGHT

The lights (plugged into the car cigarette lighter) and

camera (a EUMIG) are set. Alice has been made up, wears a

coat with purse. Martin, in his tie, faces her. They both

look over their script pages as Charles adjusts the camera.

Joe, observing, holds the boom mike (a condenser mike taped

to a broom handle), Preston wears an overcoat.

POP! Everyone JUMPS -- Charles turns -- Cary, laughing, has

just exploded a firecracker:

Martin and Alice put away their pages -- Cary gets behind the

camera. Charles stands near the camera, kneeling to camera-

height. Joe wears headphones and holds the boom over the

actors' heads. Preston holds a suitcase, ready to walk.

Martin and Alice now perform as their characters, DETECTIVE

JOHN HATHAWAY and MRS. REBECCA HATHAWAY:

Preston walks past them, acting in the background.

We're TIGHT ON JOE NOW, watching Alice. Slowly amazed at the

unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role --

And holy shit, Alice actually starts to cry as she performs

her lines. Not overdone, not hammy. Just fucking real.

Charles watches -- in awe -- he's suddenly, giddily

transported. But it's JOE who, as he stares, becomes

galvanized; any vague interest in Alice has just set:

Martin is thrown by the passion and heart of her performance.

And in the heat of it, Alice looks at Charles, unsure:

Charles is stunned -- almost crying -- can't talk -- and as

he searches, behind him, a LIGHT --

Then a distant AIRHORN -- Charles looks: AN ONCOMING TRAIN.

PUSH IN ON CHARLES, TIGHT. He turns to them all:

As Charles runs to Alice, takes her script pages.

Joe laughs a little as he goes -- Cary RIPS OPEN a YELLOW

SUPER 8 box -- Joe grabs the mike -- Cary INSERTS the film:

CLICK! Joe plugs in the mike, Charles grabs the camera:

They're set to film toward Alice, the approaching train in

her background -- Charles puts on the headphones --

And they're shooting:

Charles watches, beaming with excitement. Joe holds the boom,

looks to Charles to make sure it sounds okay; this is when he

notices something in the distance. HEADLIGHTS. A quarter mile

away, a vehicle drives along the horizon. A beat. But the

train is APPROACHING -- GETTING LOUDER -- which makes Joe

turn back toward the train -- the thing almost upon them --

LOUDER AND LOUDER, so the actors begin to YELL over the

Joe looks back at the headlights -- and sees something very

odd: the distant vehicle TURNS ONTO THE TRACKS. PUSH IN ON

JOE, unsettled -- as the train CROSSES THEM NOW -- Joe looks

back toward Alice -- a BLAST OF AIR, shockingly LOUD!

Alice and Martin continue to yell their lines -- Charles is

almost LAUGHING at how good this looks -- but Joe LOOKS

DESPERATELY BACK toward the headlights -- the train LIGHTING

UP THE OLD PICK-UP THAT IS ABOUT TO CRASH INTO THE TRAIN!

And Joe finally swings the mike down and YELLS:

GUYS, WATCH OUT!!! Joe what the hell are y--?!

-- just then BA-BA-BA-BAM!!! THE TRAIN ENGINE, HUNDREDS OF

YARDS AWAY, SLAMS INTO THE TRUCK -- THE KIDS GASP -- REACT --

AS THE TRAIN ENGINE DERAILS!

THE TRAIN BEGINS TO CRASH -- ACCORDION -- THE KIDS SCREAM --

RUN -- ENTIRE 50-TON CARS JACKNIFE AND CRASH UPWARD -- FLYING

VERTICAL -- CHARLES' SUPER 8 CAMERA AND TRIPOD SLAM ONTO THE

PLATFORM, LANDING SIDEWAYS, STILL FILMING as the CRASH WAVE

APPROACHES AND PASSES THEM!

THE KIDS SCATTER, PRESTON AND MARTIN RUN ONE WAY. CHARLES,

CARY AND JOE RUN ANOTHER. JOE STOPS AS ALICE RUNS AROUND THE

BUILDING.

They run off.

AS NEARBY CARS RIP OFF TRACKS, TUMBLE -- CARS FROM FATHER

BACK JETTISON TOWARD THEM, SLAMMING INTO THE DEPOT,

SHATTERING IT -- THE ENTIRE AREA IS DECIMATED IN AN INSTANT!

And then --

IT'S OVER. Just the odd, dying CHUGS and SCREECH-SCREECH-

SCREECH of TRAIN WHEELS running out of momentum, HISSES of

STEAM, the unnatural bending of steel.

In the DUST, JOE lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly

shut. His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: A LOUD

METAL BANG! Joe stands up fast, faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted

STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around

him. Just another few feet and he would've been crushed. But

what was that sound? Something metal? Then again: SLAM! Joe

BACKS UP, afraid -- it was almost a LABORED GROAN --

MECHANICAL or ANIMAL?! A crazy SCREECH, another BANG, then

AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

We see Joe TIGHTLY GRIPPING HIS NECKLACE LOCKET IN HIS HAND --

THEN: CRASH! -- AWFUL-LOUD -- and a TWISTED TEN-FOOT SQUARE

SHEET OF METAL EXPLODES FROM BEHIND THE OVERTURNED TRAIN CARS

-- Joe covers his head as the metal STABS THE GROUND, twenty

feet away: a TRAIN SLIDING DOOR. Joe turns to see it --

stunned -- then back to the direction of the NOISE -- but it

is GONE. Nothing.

TIGHT ON CHARLES' CAMERA -- on its side, FINISHING UP A

CARTRIDGE OF FILM.

Joe finds MARTIN, on his knees, THROWING UP -- Martin keeps

throwing up, but pumps a THUMBS UP.

Joe MOVES FORWARD -- up to camera -- behind him, Cary

appears, smiling. This kid enjoyed the crash:

Through the debris, steel and dust. Joe moves forward --

Charles, shaken, eyes wide, appears through the thick dust --

Joe moves forward, looking at, under a train WHEEL

ASSEMBLY... BLOOD. A PUDDLE OF BLOOD and Joe's heart sinks as

he moves toward it -- another woman he loves, crushed?!

Charles and Preston and Cary see the blood --

-- oh God-- -- no -- nonono...

Martin, still sick, calls out:

-- what? Guys, what is it? ... shit...

Joe moves closer to the blood -- heartsick -- on the verge of

DEEP, REAL TEARS -- everything stops -- but then:

Joe WHIPS AROUND -- standing in the dusty mess is ALICE --

shaken, but absolutely alive. Joe just BEAMS.

But JOE SUDDENLY KNOWS -- he moves to the blood -- reaches

below the wheels -- the others watch, freaked out --

Joe pulls out his CRUSHED MAKE-UP KIT. He brightens:

ALICE NOTICES THAT HE'S HOLDING THE NECKLACE. Joe notices

this and POCKETS IT self-consciously. PRESTON calls out:

Joe looks -- they all move to Preston (except Cary, who heads

off): CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many

shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES

which now litter the ground. Joe kneels, picks one up:

It's just a few inches per side, an UNUSUAL DESIGN. Behind

them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train

cars, Cary calls out:

They move up the mass of metal, revealing a VAST VIEW OF THE

WRECK. It seems to stretch on forever. It is SOBERING.

Oh my God. ... Look at that...

Joe's seen it. He points. Chilled.

Thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is THE PICK-UP

TRUCK. SHEARED IN HALF UPON IMPACT and lying in the overgrown

grass.

BOOM UP from behind the SHATTERED PICK-UP as the kids

approach from the wreckage. PUSH IN ON THEM as they arrive at

the truck and STOP; what they see makes Joe's heart pound --

they're stunned -- all of them. They just stop. Finally:

It is, yeah, for sure-- Holy shit.

WE SEE NOW: it's DR. WOODWARD -- 75, seat-belted, bloody and

unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage. Alice moves

closer -- scared and sad for him --

No one can take their eyes off this as, SOTTO:

Joe moves next to Alice, who reaches out and gently NUDGES

him -- you keep expecting him to suddenly grab her --

But he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he LEANS, his

arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was HOLDING

A PAPER, that has now fallen onto the ground. Joe picks it

up. UNFOLDS IT: it's an OLD MAP -- thin, off-white paper.

They hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring Woodward.

We see MARKER WRITING ON IT -- a BLACK LINE, from Nevada to

Dayton -- and NUMBERS written along the way.

Map of the contiguous United

States... -- what's the writing?

-- dates and times. -- what's that line across?

But a SHADOW has appeared: A TREMBLING HAND -- before they

can react, it RIPS THE MAP AWAY -- THEY ALL SCREAM AS OLD DR.

WOODWARD IS REVEALED, BLOODY EYES OPEN, in a DAZE:

They're all speechless for a moment. Finally, too loudly:

BUT WOODWARD HAS REACHED INTO HIS JACKET AND PULLED OUT A GUN

-- THE KIDS JUMP BACK, STUNNED --

We're on Joe's stunned face -- but DISTANT VOICES make him

turn his head: hundreds of yards away, through the wreck,

FIGURES WITH FLASHLIGHTS APPROACH FAST --

The rest turn to look -- their minds are racing, all of them:

The kids start moving away --

My dad will de-ball me! Let's get out of here!!!

Now they're SPRINTING -- FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer.

Charles arrives on the platform, grabs his camera.

Alice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse --

she eyes the FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer:

Joe grabs his make-up kit -- another duffel -- runs for the

car, past a whining Charles.

As the FLASHLIGHT MEN APPROACH, Joe runs and gets in the

front seat, the other boys in back -- Alice SLAMS the car

into REVERSE, SCREECH-BACKS UP, narrowly avoids debris, then

RIDES OFF -- the FLASHLIGHT MEN arrive -- SOLDIERS -- their

adrenaline pumping. One man who WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA,

eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: COLONEL

NELEC. He then looks to the ground in front of him.

CLOSE ON A FRESH, EMPTY YELLOW SUPER 8 FILM BOX. Nelec steps

to it, picks it up. Looks at it. Then back up at the

disappearing car. We PUSH IN ON HIS BURNING EYES AND --

EXT. OHIO ROAD - NIGHT

RRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRRRR! The Buick speeds past.

INT. BUICK - NIGHT

Overlapping mayhem, but Charles obsesses over his camera:

Holy shit, that was insane! He had a gun! An actual

I can't believe all that just

happened here! Nothing ever My whole camera lends is like

happens here!!! shattered now!

As Alice nervously drives, she shakes her head: no.

Joe: what was Woodward

talking about? I don't know, I don't know--

The boys all muster, "no's." Joe turns sweetly to Alice.

Alice nods; if not quite relieved, at least grateful for Joe.

But they all stare off for a long beat... haunted.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

The Buick SPEEDS AWAY...

EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CRANE DOWN as the Buick pulls up. The dusty boys pile out.

They all kind of look at each other. What a night. Charles,

who looks at Joe for a beat, holds up his defunct camera on

the tripod. Joe nods.

Alice finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out.

Joe goes to the window. Alice holds it out: THE CUBE. He

takes it with:

She just drives away. Left there are Joe, Charles, Preston,

Cary and Martin. They all kind of look at Alice go.

INT. JOE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Joe in the bath. The quiet SWISH of water as Joe holds the

CUBIC OBJECT. He relives the night: he mouths explosions.

Remembers the fear... then he smiles.

INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Joe is STARTLED AWAKE as if from a nightmare; Jack has awoken

him, quickly bucking his holster, urgent:

Gotta head in early -- -- okay--

Make sure you let Lucy out. -- I will --

Pull back WIDE to see Joe's room -- while in the FOREGROUND

is his desk, crowded with stuff. In focus, however, is the

CUBED OBJECT he took from the crash site. As the shot

progresses, you may notice that THE CUBE HAS CHANGED SHAPE;

THE VOLUME IS THE SAME, BUT THE CORNERS HAVE EXTENDED.

You gonna -- what, you with

Charles today? Yeah, I'll be with Charles--

Make sure you get the yard. -- okay, I will.

Jack heads off.

INT. JOE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

TIGHT SHOT: Joe fills Lucy's FOOD DISH with kibble. No dog.

EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - MORNING

Joe hurries across the street.

INT. CHARLES' HOUSE - MORNING

Typical Kaznyk bustle: Father busily packs sack lunches. Hot

Jen eats cereal, reads a magazine. One Twin plays HANDBALL

loudly against a wall. Peg keeps walking through the scene

with clothes. Mother cooks, says to the other twin (in grimy

It all continues as Joe has entered from the front door.

Joe is moving toward the living room, where Charles sits on

the sofa, eyes glued to the TV, A TRAIN CRASH BEING REPORTED

ON THE LOCAL NEWS; HELICOPTER SHOT of the wreck. The CHYRON

READS, "TRAIN DERAILED - AIR FORCE AIDS CLEAN UP." Joe sits

beside Charles. They both watch, stunned, as a PHOTO OF DR.

WOODWARD appears on the TV, with the heading "DRIVER OF TRUCK

CRITICALLY INJURED, BEING TREATED." WHISPERED:

Both stare at the train crash, stunned. Finally, quietly:

And we PUSH IN ON CHARLES, going from depressed and lost to

Holy shit, that's mint.

You're a total brain--! We

gotta get the camera fixed

and the film developed from

last night-- I gotta go steal

some more money from my mom!

EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - BRIDGE - MORNING

Joe and Charles ride their bikes into town, across a BRIDGE,

the massive STEEL MILL in the background --

EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - DAY

TILT DOWN from the town's WATER TOWER -- Joe and Charles ride

their bikes underneath it, crossing Main Street -- two large

MILITARY TRUCKS drive past, we may note the Airman in the

passenger seat SCANS THE AREA with a handheld device.

They park their bikes outside OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI.

INSERT - WHITE PAGES

The book opens -- Joe's finger goes down -- finds "LOUIS

DAINARD" and the phone number. We're in:

INT. OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI - MORNING

Joe at the counter, DIALING THE ROTARY PHONE, Charles behind

him with DONNY, the 19-year-old, dark-haired, bearded

salesman with a big collared button-down shirt.

Joe HEARS Alice's phone number RINGING.

We can use my dad's camera --

it's got sound and-- Hello?

As Charles opens the camera, pulls out the film:

Joe twirls a hanging Kodak "RELIVE THE MEMORIES" SUPER 8 film

PROMOTIONAL SIGN, speaking in a soft voice:

Charles hands the film cartridge to Donny.

Charles reacts; he's never smoked anything.

-- wait, hold on -- lemme

come over and show you the

pages, okay? I'll be right

there. No, d--

EXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - DAY

Lower-lower-middle class house, set against woods. Joe with

Alice at her front door. She seems unnerved:

But Alice's eyes have flicked to the Buick, pulling up.

Joe watches Louis get out of the car -- the man who got

arrested at his mother's wake -- carrying a small grocery

bag. He sees Joe and darkens as he approaches:

Joe steps back as Louis arrives; Louis seems to hate Joe, but

at the same time, can barely look at him:

Louis throws Alice a dark, resentful glare.

She nods, uncomfortable. Louis turns to Joe:

Louis goes back inside. Alice follows, turns to Joe. As

awkward moment between them. Then, quietly, conflicted:

She closes the door. Alone, despite it all, Joe is happy. Off

his smile, we HEAR LOUD POPS: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!

EXT. HILLTOP - DAY

Martin -- as Detective Hathaway -- FIRES A GUN -- shooting

CARY, dressed in a dirty suit, as a man TURNING INTO A ZOMBIE

-- his eyes WIDE AND GLOSSY WHITE -- and as he is HIT BY THE

BULLETS, he SLAMS HIS HAND ONTO HIS CHEST -- BLOOD BURSTS ALL

OVER HIM and he FALLS PAINFULLY TO THE GROUND. We then find

CHARLES, behind his camera, yelling out:

WIDE SHOT, rising PAST SIX BICYCLES, thrown to the ground in

a typical kid jumble. Charles, Joe and Preston, with Joe's

dad's KODAK CAMERA on tripod, have been filming, their gear

scattered. KEEP MOVING OVER THEM, to Martin and Alice, who

were on camera. Beyond them, in the valley, the TRAIN CRASH

seems to go forever. MILITARY TRUCKS, TENTS and SOLDIERS.

HELICOPTERS buzz in the distant sky. Joe moves over to Alice,

who looks out at the crash. During all this:

Cary sits, pulls off the CUT-OUT PING PONG BALLS that were

covering his closed eyes.

CLOSE ON JOE as he arrives beside Alice, who looks out at the

train, haunted. Quiet:

Joe stops reloading the gun, looks out, gets lost as well.

Martin has arrives there too. Preston too:

Joe suddenly WALKS AWAY FROM THEM, back toward the camera.

Joe grabs the camera, near Charles:

Joe moves the camera back to Alice -- he looks through the

lens -- uses the ZOOM -- and WE SEE JOE'S POV -- the CRASH,

ZOOMED IN -- he PANS from ONE CAR TO ANOTHER.

Alice watches Joe, who peers into the camera for a long beat,

finally standing up, looking out at the crash:

INT. DINER - DAY

The kids sit at a table at the window. The CAR LOT is across

the street. They're talking excitedly but quietly:

A WAITRESS is there, delivering more FOOD --

She heads off. Cary smiles at Alice.

Shut up, I like coffee. No one likes coffee.

Dr. Woodward had that map.

He drove onto the tracks.

Maybe there was something-- -- he wanted to destroy,

he wanted to destroy? yeah.

Pussy, stop pulling the fries

away. I ordered these for a reason.

-- he gets all possessive

with his fries, it's so

annoying.

This lands for Joe -- for all of them -- as we CUT TO:

EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY

The massive train wreck that goes on for a mile. Hundreds of

MILITARY work to clean up fast. A truck DRIVES PAST CAMERA,

taking us to Jack and Nelec, who WALK together amid the

debris. Choppers land and take off in the background:

Jack looks at Nelec -- not quite believing him...

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Jack is with Sheriff Pruitt, who stands, distracted, picking

up reports from his desk, on his way out.

Pruitt walks off. Jack, unsettled, watches him go.

INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT

FINGERS TAPPING -- they're fingers on a COUNTER, a WALKMAN

sitting beside them. BOOM UP to 23-year-old BREEN, who digs

the BLONDIE he's listening to. He is alone in the station

store. Behind him, 60-year-old SHERIFF PRUITT enters.

Breen doesn't respond. The sheriff throws a candy bar at him.

Breen pulls off the headphones.

He exits the store.

Pruitt heads out; Breen puts the headphones on again.

EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT

We see we're at the lonely gas station the kids drove past

earlier. Pruitt's SQUAD CAR filling up, the only car here.

High overhead, a yellow KELVIN sign TURNS atop a tall pole

near the road. Pruitt crosses to his car. Peels the candy

bar. Hearing something, he turns -- a PACK OF DOGS RUN BY. A

DISTANT SHOT AS THE LIGHTS ALL MOMENTARILY DIM AND FLICKER.

CLOSE UP of the PUMP'S SPINNING white NUMBER on black; the

gallons and dollar amount blurring higher -- then A BIZARRE

REFLECTION -- Pruitt sees it, turns -- and what he sees is

TALL AND TERRIFYING -- he DROPS THE CANDY -- GOES FOR HIS

GUN, BUT --

INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT

Breen, eyes closed, blasts his Walkman (we only hear TINNY

MUSIC) as, through the window behind him, the rear of the

squad car SUDDENLY SPRINGS UPWARD VIOLENTLY as if the FRONT

SECTION WAS SUDDENLY CRUSHED! PRUITT SCREAMS, MUFFLED, as the

CAR SLAMS back to the pavement -- LIGHTS FLICKER --

EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT

Gas PUMPING onto the asphalt, SCREAMS OF PRUITT, horrible,

INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT

PRUITT'S SCREAMS END as Breen OPENS HIS EYES AND RIPS off the

headphones: the hell was that? He looks outside -- sees the

car -- shattered windows. Confused, he heads out --

EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT

Breen moves tentatively toward the CRUSHED CAR -- quickly

glances for Pruitt, who's missing. He gets close to the car,

confounded by what he sees -- hands shaking, he rights the

pump and replaces it. His heart pounds as he starts for the

building -- but SLIPS ON THE GAS -- falls hard -- looks up --

sees whatever's coming for him -- SCREAMS as he gets to his

feet and RUNS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER --

INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT

Breen RUSHES INSIDE -- we're WITH HIM as behind him:

KKKRASH!!!! An EXPLOSION OF GLASS AND JUNK FOOD and --

EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT

WE LOOK DOWN UPON THE STATION FROM UP HIGH -- where the

turning, lit KELVIN SIGN BLOCKS OUR VIEW FOR THE MOMENT -- we

can only HEAR THE HORROR happening inside the station until

FINALLY the sign REVEALS THE STATION -- everything inside

looks like it's in a BLENDER -- THERE'S A SUPER-HUMAN

UPHEAVAL HAPPENING IN THERE -- and Breen's SCREAMS CONTINUE

as the turning Kelvin sign BLOCKS OUR VIEW AGAIN -- as the

SOUND GETS UNBEARABLE, A SUDDEN CUT TO:

A FACE. A MAKE-UP BRUSH APPLYING MAKE-UP. It's ALICE, and

she's becoming a ZOMBIE. We are:

INT. CHARLES' KITCHEN - DAY

Joe makes her up -- a not half-bad, simple ZOMBIE MAKE-UP.

Pale skin, sunken eyes and cheekbones. In the background, the

other kids prepare to film.

He hands her a mirror, she gazes into it, sort of amazed.

She nods. Whatever. Charles is suddenly there, with Cary:

Joe doesn't want to do this at all. AT ALL. But...

Mint. Gnarly!

Charles and Cary head off, planning the explosions. Alice

looks at him knowingly.

The LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE DIM -- BROWN OUT -- then back on.

That's like the third time Dude. Bitchen.

that's happened.

Alice considers this -- then, after a beat, starts doing her

best zombie. Joe smiles, `cause it's pretty good.

And Alice slowly leans in toward him -- is this performance?

Or is this something else--? And she PUTS HER MOUTH ON HIS

NECK IN A FAKE BITE, which makes Joe go still -- a shiver

down his spine -- he's never felt anything like this in his

life. And when she pulls back, her performance over, she's

smiling. He doesn't know what to say, tries to stay cool.

EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - DAY

We're NEAR THE GAS PUMPS, LOW TO THE GROUND -- DOLLY as Jack,

EDIE and MR. BLAKELY come out here. We pass SMALL SHATTERED

PIECES OF RED AND BLUE PLASTIC and STOP AND RACK to the GUN

Sheriff Pruitt dropped.

Jack kneels by the Smith and Wesson Model 19. Jack pulls out

a handkerchief, lifts the fun -- PUSH IN ON the engraved

initials "H.P." JACK IS ROCKED BY THIS. He opens the cylinder

to check if it had been fired.

CUT BACK WIDE. No squad car here. Jack checks out the broken

BLUE AND RED PLASTIC as he makes a walkie call:

EXT. CAR LOT - DAY

Angry IZZY, 65, OPENS A NEW CAR HOOD: PIECES OF THE ENGINE

RIPPED AWAY, MESSY -- DOLLY WITH HIM, Jack follows:

Izzy opens ANOTHER CAR HOOD: PIECES MISSING.

ANOTHER HOOD -- PIECES MISSING.

As Jack heads back to his car, THREE RESIDENTS move to him,

walk with him, AD LIB:

-- Some strange shit has been -- d'you call the station

going on. My antenna's gone-- yet. You need to call the

our dog is gone, he hasn't station. And file a report,

come home this morning -- before anything can be done

Jack, my lights keep going on about it. And then we can

and off. Counting on you, take care of these things. If

Jack. you do that for me, I promise

He seems to have appeased them -- but as he turns, we see how

stressed he is. He stops, noticing FOUR MILITARY TRUCKS

DRIVING PAST, SLOWLY, ANTENNAS atop the trucks, and the men

inside seemingly scanning the area. Jack is disturbed by

this.

EXT. HILL TOP

Joe rides along a hillside. Parks his bike. Walks toward the

edge.

He stops to reveal the town of Lillian.

EXT. LILLIAN STREET - DUSK

Joe rides the street, calling out:

WIDE SHOT as he DIPS down a neighborhood hill, sun LOW.

EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - DUSK

A community CORKBOARD. Joe posts up a piece of paper; we SEE

IT NOW IN CLOSE-UP. It's a MISSING DOG SIGN FOR LUCY. We're

on Joe's face as he finishes pinning it up -- when something

he sees makes him stop. He slowly takes a step back. Then

another... his eyes glued to the board.

Then we see the REVERSE -- SLOWLY PULLING BACK -- REVEALING

THAT THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF BRAND NEW "DOG MISSING"

SIGNS POSTED ON THE BOARD. It's COVERED in them. Joe is so

stunned, he doesn't notice the MILITARY TRUCKS that pass in

the background behind him.

INT. JOE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

KA-BAM: back door opens, Joe enters. EMPTY PIZZA BOX on the

table. Jack and four POLICE OFFICERS in the living room,

smoking, reviewing POLICE REPORTS, marking MAPS, taking notes

-- WORKING ON THE PROBLEMS THEY'RE HAVING --

The officers agree. Joe moves into the doorway where his dad

and other convene.

Joe has heard this and DROPPED HIS FLASHLIGHT -- the men all

turn, silent. Joe, on the spot:

Then the POWER GOES OUT -- the men react -- it FLICKERS ON

AND OFF -- Jack grabs his radio a the POWER RETURNS:

INT. JOE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Joe paints his model on the floor of his living room,

watching In Search Of and talking to Charles on his walkie

talkie.

And Joe tries to snap himself out of it. But is disturbed.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

WIDE SHOT: middle of nowhere wooded area as an OHIO POWER

CHERRY PICKER TRUCK drives up, parks beside a UTILITY POLE.

INT. DWP CHERRY PICKER - NIGHT

ROONEY, 49. Cigarette in his mouth, makes notes on a

weathered clipboard. Glances at the power line. Doesn't

understand what he sees -- PUSH IN ON HIM. He radios in:

He DRIVES AGAIN -- we see a WIDE SHOT OF THE LANDSCAPE --

HALF A DOZEN UTILITY POLES -- ALL BARE -- NOT ONE WIRE.

EXT. SALVAGE YARD ROAD - NIGHT

The truck comes to a stop, roadside. Tall trees and a SALVAGE

YARD behind them. PUSH IN ON ROONEY who calls in:

In the cherry picker bucket, Rooney works the controls. He

begins LIFTING; a WIDE SHOT shows him rising to the bare

utility pole STEPDOWN TRANSFORMER. When Rooney finally gets

to the top, with gloves hands, he inspects the transformer.

After a moment, though, he stops. HEARS something else, past

the sound of electricity. He looks over toward the SALVAGE

YARD. Except it's mostly hidden by the trees. From here,

Rooney can only see the tops of the JUNK PILES. A small

METALLIC CRASH. Then ANOTHER.

Rooney cranes his neck to get a view. Another METALLIC CRASH,

this time GLASS BREAKING, too. Then, in the distance, at the

middle of the salvage yard, SOMETHING FLIES INTO THE AIR,

FALLING AND LANDING WITH A CLANG-THUNK.

Rooney strains his eyes to see -- what the hell was that? A

tin can? A piece of a fender? Hard to tell from here.

Then, thrown into the air: A CAR TIRE. It lands with a THUD.

Rooney then uses the bucket controls -- MOVES BACKWARD AND UP

-- a touch higher toward the transformer -- not exactly

watching how close he is getting. He stops. Watches.

An ENTIRE JUNKED MOTORCYCLE flies into the air, discarded,

twirling, and CRASH LANDS, out of sight.

Rooney is stunned. As the METALLIC RUMMAGING SOUNDS CONTINUE,

Rooney moves the bucket EVEN HIGHER -- when suddenly his

bucket BEEP-BEEPS LOUDLY -- a warning he's too high -- and he

suddenly stops it and the BEEPING STOPS --

But so do the rummaging sounds. SILENCE, save for the eerie

HUM OF POWER. He waits. Nothing. Wants a better view, so he

begins to LOWER THE BUCKET.

We're in a WIDE SHOT, seeing his DESCEND, PAINFULLY SLOWLY.

Then we're in a LONG LENS CLOSE UP of Rooney as he SLOWLY

DROPS -- TIGHT ON HIM as he's looking over toward the salvage

yard -- and it takes us a minute to realize there's fucking

SOMETHING BEHIND HIM -- SO BIG WE DIDN'T SEE IT -- COMING OUT

OF THE SHADOWS -- IT'S GOT MUSCLE AND FLESH AND IT MAKES AN

UNGODLY SOUND AND IT INSTANTLY GRABS HIM -- THE TRUCK ROCKS

AS WE CUT INSIDE THE CAB OF THE TRUCK, LOOKING OUT THE

WINDSHIELD -- KEEEEEEESH!!! IT SPIDERS AS ROONEY'S LEGS

IMPACT THE GLASS AND SUDDENLY WE'RE IN A WIDE SHOT OF THE

CHERRY PICKER, ROCKING BACK AND FORTH IN INCREASINGLY SMALLER

MOVEMENTS, UNTIL THE TRUCK IS MOTIONLESS. Empty. Alone.

Then: NOISE -- and an AMPLIFIED VOICE:

INT. TOWN HALL - DAY

A LOUD TOWN MEETING. Two-hundred frustrated CITIZENS crowd

the auditorium. Jack at the podium, TOWN OFFICIALS, including

the local MAYOR sit on stage as well. Currently, MRS. BABBIT,

52, speaks into the microphone on the floor:

The town ROARS its approval -- Jack, impotent, tries:

The town ERUPTS in agreement --

A short, bald man of 65, MR. MCCANDLESS speaks:

PUSH IN ON JACK, HEARING THIS --

The Mayor takes over as Jack has a SIDEBAR MEETING with Mr.

-- it was like having my -- that must be very annoying-

radio hi-jacked-- - you don't know the

-- sure I do: 13201 to 13710, (pulls out paper, pen)

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Jack hurries from the town meeting to the station --

Jack continues, into:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

DOLLY FAST with an exasperated Jack as he WRITES, tailed by

ASSISTANT DEPUTY ROSKO --

He heads for his office, seeing LOUIS, who is being escorted

out by an Officer across the room.

Louis heads out -- HOLD ON JACK AS he turns, ENTERS HIS

OFFICE, and as that door opens, we CUT TO:

INT. JOE'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

The door opens of his messy, motherless room. Joe and Alice

enter. He could not be more self-conscious. He moves stacks

of comic, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed -- pair of

underwear and socks. He closes the closet and hangs a bath

towel on his desk chair. She looks around sa she enters. The

light dim, intimate.

Joe quickly moves a pile of papers and books from the desk to

the floor; NOTEBOOKS AND SCHOOL WORK spill out and we get a

GLIMPSE of some "B-MINUSES" and other "C-PLUSES" in RED.

Joe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his MODELS:

Alice sits on the bed. Joe takes the FIVE-CAR TRAIN MODEL.

She moves close:

Alice hold it. Joe watches her. She really looks at it.

Her face is so close to his. Her hair touches his ear.

Lost in thought, he looks at her. Suddenly self-conscious.

It takes him a beat. Finally:

Their tension INTERRUPTED BY an out of breath Charles:

INT. POLICE STATION - JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

Jack with OFFICER TALLY (24):

Tally puts a MAP on his desk -- 28 DOTS in a CIRCLE, anywhere

from a 20 to 150 MILE RADIUS, WITH LILLIAN AT THE CENTER.

Jack is stunned.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Officer Rosko at his desk, with a YOUNG WOMAN, a HAM RADIO at

his desk beside a REEL-TO-REEL TAPE DECK. He takes notes:

Suddenly a GARBLED ELECTRONIC SOUND from the HAM RADIO. Rosko

quickly hits RECORD on the reel-to-reel --

He grabs speaker, turns the volume knob, puts the speaker

close to the tape recorder, turns on recorder.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

FOUR OFFICERS gather as Jack PLAYS BACK THE REEL-TO-REEL

through Milner's DESCRAMBLER. He WRITES DOWN AS THEY LISTEN

TO MEN'S VOICES, creepily FILTERED and BROKEN UP:

--zero-niner center opera - (AD LIB)

ocal position-- fangs out. Listen, that's Air Force.

Cop-- confirm, Operation What are they doing

Walking Distance is-- six- transmitting on these

three-niner, retur-- frequencies? Maybe they don't

erations. want anyone to find em? Maybe

EXT. WOODWARD'S HOUSE - DAY

MILITARY VEHICLES parked everywhere. Personnel removing boxes

from the house, packing it all up. But out front, Joe is

dressed as an Airman, performing with Martin, dressed as the

detective.

Military trucks surround the house. Hathaway is with a

Officer Joe hands Hathaway a FILE. Hathaway looks at it.

Cary behind the camera, Charles beside him:

As it continues, we see Alice behind the camera, watching

Joe, smiling. But then she sees something that disturbs her:

Jack's CRUISER pulls up.

INT. WOODWARD'S HOUSE - DAY

A dozen OFFICERS go through HUNDREDS OF CARDBOARD BOXES of

documents. Books and personal belongings are put into boxes,

taken from the house. Overmyer enters, crosses to Nelec, who

reviews a folder.

But Nelec has seen something outside: THE KIDS.

Behind them, a WINDOW, showing the street, where Jack insists

Joe get into the car. Nelec looks out -- sees Jack take Joe

by the arm, grab the tripod and head to his squad car.

EXT. WOORWARD'S HOUSE - DAY

As Jack gets out, he sees the kids and isn't happy. He moves

toward Joe and his friends:

Joe spins around as Jack arrives, grabs his camera from

Charles and saying firmly, to Joe:

Joe is stunned -- instantly humiliated in front of Alice --

he's taken back to the squad car --

Jack OPENS the car's back door -- Joe gets in -- Jack SLAMS

it shut, then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger

seat and SLAMS that door, heading to the house, leaving Joe

in the back. Nelec heads outside -- Jack moves to him:

This lands on Nelec.

Jack heads off.

Jack stops, turns to uncomfortable Nelec.

INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY

Joe, his breathing heavying, sits in the car, heart pounding,

watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again.

Then he looks over at his friends -- Charles giving him a

"WHAT THE FUCK?!" Look. Alice watches him sympathetically.

She mouths to him a guilty, "...is it me...?" And Joe shakes

his head: "No." But we -- and she -- know better.

EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY

The squad car pulls up. Jack gets out, Joe follows -- THE

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT WE ARE:

INT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY

Door opens. Jack enters, then lets Joe pass him. Joe closes

the door hard and says, angrily, but restrained:

Jack turns to leave -- but Joe, enraged, says:

Jack stops -- stunned -- Joe's heart pounds --

Jack moves CLOSE to Joe -- intimidating -- Joe steps back --

Jack is fucking intense:

Jack suddenly stops himself, realizing what he's saying. And

to whom he's saying it. But somehow, in this moment, he can't

be a better father than law officer. Not yet. More upset at

himself than Joe, he heads out.

EXT. LILLIAN STREET - DUSK

Joe rides UP A HILL -- BOOM UP -- REVEAL THE TOWN CEMETERY.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Joe sits, his back against his mother's grave. Holds her OPEN

LOCKET, staring at it. He's just come here for comfort. But

then -- a SOUND -- and Joe turns. Deep and low, in the

distance. Joe is motionless. HEARS IT AGAIN. He stands, pulls

out his flashlight -- aims the beam down ROWS OF GRAVES,

toward the big CARETAKER'S SHED in the distance. Another

INTENSE, LOW SOUND -- then a high pitch HIT, like METAL ON

WOOD and Joe backs up, nervous. Another odd sound -- then

ANOTHER -- which TRANSITIONS US TO:

EXT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Jack's squad car arrives at the abandoned airfield.

EXT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jack's car pulls up. He gets out of the car. Suddenly the

three large MILITARY TRUCKS' HEADLIGHTS COME ON -- all aimed

at Jack -- he is blinded -- tries to see --

And now BODIES are seen of SOLDIERS, holding and aiming

WEAPONS. Then, a VOICE over a TRUCK PA:

INT. MILITARY MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT

TIGHT ON NELEC. Past an IV and medical machinery. He's

looking at someone we don't yet see. In the background,

Overmyer stands, watching. Nelec is quiet, simple:

Now we see who he's talking to. IT'S DR. WOODWARD. Battered

and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant.

Dr. Woodward swallows. Feels that his time on Earth is coming

to an end no matter what he does here. By the door, Overmyer

is quietly putting on his BLACK GLOVES.

Nelec offers a vague, searching smile. But Woodward will not -

- not ever -- relent. So. Nelec moves to the door, he remains

FACING CAMERA, his back to Woodward, as Overmyer moves to the

bed. PUSH IN ON NELEC'S FACE, UNDERSTANDING HIS TRUE NATURE

AS WE CUT TO:

INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Joe sleeps, power still out. Then, a KNOCK. He wakes up.

Another KNOCK. His window. He moves to it. Opens it. It's

Alice. Joe is half asleep, but also stunned. Very quietly:

And Alice climbs in. Joe sits on the floor. Alice does too.

It's odd and silent for a moment.

Joe stares, amazed at her.

And the POWER RETURNS -- Joe's CLOCK LIGHT goes on behind him

-- but more chilling, the PROJECTOR comes back on; the SILENT

HOME MOVIE OF HIS MOTHER PLAYS. Joe crawls to the projector

to stop it -- but:

Alice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She

watches the film. Can't take her eyes away.

And as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN... as tears start to

fill her eyes. Behind her, at a near WHISPER:

A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that.

Finally, quietly:

Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned. Finally, eyes

wet, Alice turns to Joe.

Joe just stares at her... heartsick and speechless. Finally:

Just then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS.

Joe turns off the projector -- but a SOUND REMAINS. A sort of

SHUDDER-HUM. Joe unplugs the projector, but the sound

remains. Then they look: THE SHUDDERING IS COMING FROM THE

CUBE HE TOOK FROM THE CRASH SITE, sitting on his desk.

Joe and Alice move to it. He turns on his desk lamp. The cube

VIBRATES, almost imperceptibly.

-- has this--? -- no.

Joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube

-- the thing SHUDDERS ON ITS OWN.

They are amazed. They get LOW -- eyes at desk level -- the

SHUDDERING INCREASES IN PITCH AND VOLUME -- he reaches out to

touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube BULLETS AWAY -

- ACROSS THE ROOM -- AND BLASTS THROUGH THE WALL, LEAVING A

FIVE-INCH HOLE IN THE WALL! She screams -- they both fall to

the floor, STUNNED -- PUSH IN ON Joe, his heart pounding. He

moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance,

trees and the TOWN WATER TOWER.

INT. ALICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice enters the dark house quietly. She steps carefully

toward her room, when --

His voice makes her JUMP. She turns: sitting in the dark, in

an armchair, is her father. He's awake. And drunk.

A tense beat, her mind races. Breathe, Alice, just breathe.

This kills her -- but she does: she leaves the house.

EXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - PRE-DAWN

Alice, crying, gets on her bike and rides off -- a DISTANT

FIERY GLOW past the factory and over the hills. The front

door opens -- Louis comes out and yells, miserable:

But she's far gone -- Louis' mind races -- he runs to his

BUICK -- starts it up -- PULLS OUT FAST and goes after her --

EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN

Alice PEDALS HARD, she wants to escape everywhere. No cars on

the street, no people. A block behind her, SCREECH: a CAR

turns onto the road. Her father's car -- she makes a turn --

INT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN

We're with Louis as he drive -- clearly drunk --

EXT. SHARP TURN ROAD - PRE-DAWN

Alice makes a daring stop -- turns back up the hill, pedals

hard, crying and hyperventilating --

Louis sees her, tries to stop, but can't -- and his car SLAMS

INTO A PARKED CAR IN A VIOLENT, SUDDEN STOP!

EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN

Alice GASPS -- stops pedaling -- looks back at her father's

car, wide-eyed and terrified -- should she go back?!

INT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN

Louis is bleeding. Badly hurt. He adjusts himself --

painfully -- then looks into the CRACKED-GLASS REAR VIEW

MIRROR -- AND HE SEES SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIS EYES GO WIDE.

EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN

Alive is still looking back at the car -- SO SHE DOESN'T SEE

THE SHAPE THAT IS COMING BEHIND HER -- and just as she

decides: I'M NOT GOING BACK, she turns to begin riding on --

BUT SEES SOMETHING AND SCREAMS --

INT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN

THROUGH THE MOSAIC OF THE SHATTERED REAR VIEW MIRROR, WE SEE

THE CREATURE GRAB ALICE -- HER SCREAMS BECOME HER FATHER'S:

Louis tries to get out of the car -- but it's painful -- and

his door is JAMMED SHUT -- he goes for the passenger door --

EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN

-- when Louis finally gets out -- he runs from his car --

stumbling drunk and bleeding -- SCREAMING, SHREDDING HIS

VOCAL CHORDS --

But all that's there is her bike -- and before he can even

get that far, Louis FALLS HARD onto the pavement, crying, a

drunken, horrified, shocked, battered MESS. In a WIDE SHOT,

LOUIS is in the middle of the street, Alice's fallen bike on

the sidewalk.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

In the great distance, the WATER TOWER. We BOOM DOWN in a

MASSIVE WIDE SHOT of a field at night. Then a LONG LENS SHOT

of SIX SOLDIERS standing in the field. But ONE stands out

front, wearing a FLAME THROWER. And suddenly the quiet is

broken by the ROAR OF FLAME. A WIDE, WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT as

the flames ARC in the tall, dry grass. Over the radio:

EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - EARLY MORNING

The distant factory, the even more distant mountains, and an

ominous PLUME OF SMOKE -- a far-off SIREN is HEARD. Then:

INT. OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI - MORNING

Joe stands at the counter with Charles, who is in a bad mood.

Donny's returned with a DEVELOPED FILM ENVELOPE. A red "RUSH"

stamp on it. He gives Charles his change:

Charles heads off -- Joe follows.

EXT. OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI - DAY

As Charles rides off with the film, Joe follows -- and we

BOOM UP along the WATER TOWER as they go --

As we CONTINUE BOOMING UP, we arrive at the top of the WATER

TOWER, where THE CUBE HAS AFFIXED ITSELF TO THE SIDE --

unseen from the street. In the distance, THE THREATENING FIRE

SMOKE LOOMS --

EXT. CHARLES' HOUSE - DAY

As Joe and Charles ride their bikes up to his house:

Frustrated beyond belief, Charles goes inside. Joe follows.

INT. CHARLES' ROOM - DAY

Charles threads the film into the projector.

Charles ROLLS THE FILM, DIMS THE LIGHTS --

And suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there

she is: ALICE, from the night of the train crash. The scene

plays as they filmed it:

THE FILMED SCENE CONTINUES as Joe and Charles argue:

Joe's mind spins -- how does he respond to this?!

They watch for a moment as the TRAIN CRASH HAPPENS -- but

it's SO SUDDEN, SO FAST, the camera picks up almost nothing.

Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the

SETTLING DEBRIS. Charles moves forward, so the film is now

partially BEING PROJECTED ON HIM.

Joe moves forward. Part of the film PROJECTED ON HIM, too.

But Joe has seen something -- on the screen -- SOTTO:

But Joe has slapped Charles' arm, his eyes locked to the

screen -- Charles looks too -- AND NOW WE SEE IT: through the

BROKEN CAMERA LENS -- SOMETHING MOVES -- SOMETHING BIG --

FROM THE TRAIN CAR, THROUGH THE WRECKAGE -- what the hell is

it? TOO DAMN BIG -- MOSTLY OUT OF FRAME, ITS SHAPE AND FLESH

TOO BIZARRE -- we only see the LEGS as it clears frame --

PUSH IN ON THEIR FACES AS THEY SEE THE ALIEN THEY'VE CAPTURED

ON FILM -- then from outside: AN AIR RAID SIREN RAMPS,

WHINING THROUGH THE TOWN. The boys look at each other --

afraid. QUICK CLOSE-UPS as they REWIND THE FILM AND RIP IT

OUT AND TAKE THE CANNISTER:

EXT. LILLIAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

WIDE SHOT of the neighborhood -- in the distance: MILITARY

TRUCKS, JEEPS AND BUSES drive. NEIGHBORS coming from their

homes in the MID-GROUND: confusion and talk, more VEHICLES.

Finally, as we BOOM DOWN, RACK TO JOE AND CHARLES, trying to

make sense of this -- Joe calls to a passing adult, MR.

Mr. Harkin POINTS -- Joe turns to look -- we PAN: THE DISTANT

SMOKE, BIG AND LOOMING.

VARIOUS SHOTS of MILITARY busses STOPPING -- SOLDIERS

ORDERING AND ASSISTING PEOPLE ONTO VEHICLES -- carrying all

the belongings they can. Others quickly LOAD UP CARS,

strapping belongings to the roof. Over all this:

Other people in a panic, running to find others who are lost.

A LITTLE GIRL CRIES amid the madness.

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe and Charles get on, frightened and uncomfortable. They

sit. Outside: the madness of the evac -- they scan the crowd.

You see your family anywhere? -- no, you see your dad?

-- no...

EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - DAY

The evacuation BUSES drive through Main Street -- passing

soldiers who are MOVING IN THE RED CARGO TRUCKS that we may

recognize from the train crash site: THE CONTENTS FROM THE

TRAIN ARE BEING MOVED INTO THE CENTER OF TOWN.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

SUPER WIDE SHOT as an ENDLESS LINE OF BUSES, CARS and TRUCKS

makes its way from Lillian to...

EXT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE - DAY

The buses drive past the guard gate into the base -- into the

huge HANGAR that we were in earlier. Those who drove

themselves PARK THEIR CARS -- and are ushered to the hangar.

DONNY steps out of his 1972 PONTIAC CATALINA, carrying a

duffel. RACK FOCUS to see we're IN THE BUS with Joe, who has

seen Donny -- and they drive INSIDE THE HANGAR --

INT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - DAY

ARMED Air Force and National Guard SOLDIERS direct MASSES OF

PEOPLE, carrying luggage and belongings. Move with Joe and

Charles, who scan for familiar faces -- suddenly Charles'

MOTHER IS THERE -- embraces Charles:

He heads off. ORDERS are being BARKED -- RESIDENTS can be

heard, complaining and arguing. Walkie SQUAWKS and PA

ANNOUNCEMENTS as SOLDIERS check their wrist bands. Joe passes

an ARGUING MAN and SOLDIER:

-- I need to go back to my -- sir, the town is sealed

house, I left some medication off -- no one is allowed back

that my wife needs-- -- you can talk to the nurses

-- no, we can't get it here -- the town must stay

anywhere else, I need to go empty until we've been given

back-- the all-clear--

BOOM UP TO REVEAL the EVAC CENTER. A THOUSAND PEOPLE so far.

INT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - DAY

LOUIS lies in a cot in the TRIAGE UNIT, fifty beds

transferred from the hospital. Louis stares off, head

bandaged, eyes open, MUTTERING TO HIMSELF, like a man as

tired, hung over, injured and in shock as he is.

Find Joe, who is looking everywhere for his dad -- he finally

sees Louis and hurries to him.

And Louis GRABS HIS SHIRT and pulls him close. In a voice

desperate and heartsick, he says:

Joe's mind is on fire as he absorbs this -- HE WHISPERS:

And Louis looks at him with hope --

CUT TO JOE WITH HIS FRIENDS, assembled around a set of cots.

That thing took her--?! -- are you shitting me?

They look at him like he's from Uranus.

Back where? To do what?

She's dead, if it took her,

she-- -- don't say that!

INT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - DAY

Jen, Charles' hot sister, lies on her cot making her Columbia

House Records choices. Charles is in her face.

Jen suddenly closes her magazine, stares at him suspiciously.

INT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - DAY

Jen looks RIGHT AS US, vulnerable, but seductive:

Now we see Donny, looking RIGHT AT US. Utterly stunned.

EXT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - DAY

MOVING PAST as Donny moves through PARKED CARS, Joe, Charles,

Cary and Martin keeping up:

The boys duck as SOLDIERS pass by.

INT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT ROOM - DAY

A small, tiled room, no windows. Jack, up all night and

pissed off, but bored being pissed off, POUNDS ON THE DOOR:

A beat. He POUNDS again. The door finally unlocks and opens.

A 32-year-old humorless, armed SOLDIER stands there.

INT. MUNICIPAL AIRPOT CORRIDOR - DAY

Jack is led down a dilapidated, narrow hall. Soldier with the

semi-auto behind him, aimed at his back. As Jack passes an

open door, he spies an empty office -- through the window on

the tarmac are a few MILITARY VEHICLES, a handful of airmen.

Jack's mind races as he approaches the bathroom at the end of

the hall -- Jack turns:

-- AND MID-SENTENCE, JACK GRABS THE GUN, PULLS THE SOLDIER

AND SLAMS HIM HARD IN THE THROAT! THE STUNNED SOLDIER GETS

SLAM-FLATTENED BY JACK, who KNEELS to him. PUSH IN CLOSE --

his eyes wide, mind racing -- WHAT THE HELL NEXT? CUT TO:

INT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT BUILDING - DAY

BEHIND A SOLDIER as he RUNS through the dark building -- oh

shit -- he comes to a stop, back against the wall -- but PUSH

IN on his face: IT'S JACK, IN AN AIR FORCE UNIFORM. He is

fucking scared; at least he's holding a rifle. He peels

around a corner -- through a window, the tarmac: GUARDS,

VEHICLES. Jack's eyes shift -- he spots an AIRCRAFT FUEL

TANK. Eyes wild -- A METALLIC CLI-CHUNK AS HE UNSAFETIES THE

EXT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT - DAY

A SOLDIER crosses to a vehicle, on his radio when KAFA-

BOOOOOM! The FUEL TANK EXPLODES, A MASSIVE BLAST! The airmen

take cover, RUN TO MOVE NEARBY VEHICLES, GENERAL MAYHEM --

and our CAMERA BOOMS UP -- to the MILITARY JEEP THAT DRIVES

AWAY FROM THE AIRFIELD --

INT. JEEP - DAY

Jack behind the wheel, he blasts the vehicle through the

exit, along the road back to town --

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

Jack drives up in the jeep -- comes to a stop in SHOCKED

CLOSE UP -- we see in the distance the MASS OF VEHICLES

driving from town --

Jack's mind races --

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

The jeep RACES past camera -- we PAN -- revealing as

APPROACHING CAR: DONNY'S CATALINA:

INT. DONNY'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

Donny drives, Joe shotgun. Charles, Cary and Martin in back.

Donny YANKS the steering wheel -- he turns onto a DIRT ROAD --

the car RUMBLES away from camera --

EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DUSK

Donny's car pulls up, lights go off. The kids pile out --

EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DUSK

A SHOT of the boys CLIMBING A FENCE.

They move fast across the alley, to a TRAILER locked with A

PADLOCK -- the DUNGEON.

Joe tries PRYING the locks off with the tire iron -- it

doesn't budge.

Joe hands the tire iron to Charles -- he tries -- nothing.

As Martin grabs the tire iron:

Martin breaks off the LATCH -- BAM!

Now we CUT TO DARKNESS -- we're INSIDE THE DUNGEON as it

opens -- the boys look DIRECTLY AT US -- their faces say it

all: THE MOTHER LODE.

Look at all this junk. He's got movies in here.

INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL HALL - DUSK

The boys -- with FLASHLIGHTS -- turn a corner -- hurry down

the hall --

The boys BREAK A CLASSROOM DOOR WINDOW and enter.

INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT - LATER

We're looking down at the boys, SURROUNDED by hundreds of

documents, boxes, photographs, 16MM film cannisters and

cassette tapes. Charles threads the film.

Joe holds up a 20-year-old PHOTO of MEN IN A LAB. Among them

is 50-year-old WOODWARD:

Cary puts a CASSETTE into a tape deck, hits PLAY:

-- I told them this creature

is more sophisticated than

any of us. That his species -- that's him --

subterranean. He's being -- subterranean --

treated without compassion or

respect....

VARIOUS SHOTS of PHOTOGRAPHS AND DOCUMENTS: "UFO CRASH,"

"MAJOR NELEC IN CHARGE OF OPERATIONS," "TWO ALIEN BODIES, ONE

LIVING," "RESTRAINTS USED," "EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED" -- as

Charles threads a FILM:

The FILM: an AIR FORCE LOGO pops on and off. We see inside a

HANGAR, where dozens of SCIENTISTS examine LARGE, BUS-SIZED

pieces of jagged and unearthly material. All the while:

Scientist explaining something to a group of SENIOR OFFICERS.

Among them, a 32-year-old NELEC.

Film JUMP CUTS to a HUGE REINFORCED LAB CAGE. Inside, sitting

almost in a ball, IS THE MASSIVE CREATURE. Hard to see here.

Another JUMP CUT as a SOLDIER offers a bucket of FOOD to the

alien -- IT'S WOODWARD.

Woodward offers what looks like RAW MEAT to the motionless,

sitting CREATURE. All the boys watch quietly -- then,

suddenly, in milliseconds, the creature is UP, GRABBING

WOODWARD THROUGH THE BARS -- the boys JUMP --

Arh! I can't watch that!

The boys are SCARED as they watch the creature HOLD WOODWARD

TIGHT -- LIFT HIM -- and its TENTACLES suddenly THRUST into

his NOSE, EARS and MOUTH --

Joe stands and looks intently at the screen.

Just then a MUFFLED SHATTER-CRASH --

Suddenly BOOM! The doors BURST OPEN and ARMED COMMANDOS,

NIGHT VISION GOGGLES OBSCURING THEIR FACES, AIMING SEMI-AUTO

WEAPONS AT THE BOYS WHO SCREAM --

DON'T KILL US! PLEASE DON'T (calls on radio)

KILL US!!! PLEASE DON'T KILL -- we've got civilians --

US!!! minors-- four of `em.

INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT

Donny gets stoned in his car. Doesn't notice the MOVEMENT in

the distance behind him. The MILITARY coming in.

INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT

The locker hallway: the Boys are HANDCUFFED AND SCARED, being

led out by ARMED SOLDIERS. Nelec moves to them. QUIETLY:

Overmyer CHECKS THEIR POCKETS as Nelec TAKES CARY'S BACKPACK,

opens it -- pulls out some FIREWORKS. Proudly:

Joe's terrified as Overmyer pulls from Joe's pocket a couple

COINS, half a pack of Bubble Yum and HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE.

Drops everything but the necklace. Joe reacts, panicked --

Joe's on the verge of tears as Overmyer POCKETS the necklace.

Off the TERRIFIED BOYS as they're ushered away --

EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT

The BOYS are put onto the bus -- BOOM DOWN to DONNY'S CAR IN

THE FOREGROUND, where we realize that WE HAVEN'T BEEN THE

ONLY AUDIENCE TO THIS: Donny, sunk deep in his seat, hiding,

watches wide-eyed as the bus DRIVES AWAY.

His stoned mind races. Staying hidden from the remaining

military, Donny scrambles for his CB, turns to CHANNEL 9,

grabs the mike, speaks quietly, frantic:

INT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - NIGHT

Jack moves fast through the crowded evac area --

Jack moves to Officer Rosko, who reacts to seeing him dressed

this way --

Off Jack's REACTION --

INT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - NIGHT

Preston reads ISAAC ASIMOV'S SCIENCE FICTION MAGAZINE --

suddenly Jack is there, grabs him and pulls him up:

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

The TRANSPORT BUS speeds on the road, the only vehicle here.

INT./EXT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON THE DRIVER as a RADIO CALL come in:

Nelec arrives, grabs the radio mike:

PAN as Nelec moves back -- we PUSH IN on OVERMYER, who sits

near the front, putting on his DARK GLOVES. Nelec sits, which

takes us to a shot towards the back of the bus -- another

Airman, HERNANDEZ, 40, sits too. PUSH PAST THEM toward our

four BOYS, sitting cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty,

wired SAFETY GLASS, all looking toward us, terrified.

Joe is suddenly hopeful:

But just as he's spoken, a SHAPE FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND HIM

SLAMS HARD INTO THE BUS, SPIDER-WEBBING THE BULLETPROOF

GLASS! The ENTIRE BUS IS ROCKED, Charles SCREAMS, hurt --

At the front of the bus, NELEC FALLS -- HITS A BENCH, THEN

CRASHES INTO THE SIDE WINDOW --

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

The bus was hit SO HARD it rides for a moment ONLY ON ITS

RIGHT TIRES --

INT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT

The MILITARY DRIVER struggles with the wheel --

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

The bus SLAMS BACK onto the road, LOUD -- A TIRE BLOWS! We

MOVE AROUND THE BUS -- JUST MISSING SEEING THE CREATURE --

INT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT

The kids panic as the HOBBLED BUS STILL DRIVES --

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

HIGH OVERHEAD: the bus comes to a sudden SCREECHING stop.

INT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT

Charles looks forward --

Joe turns to see NELEC LOADING A RIFLE, straining to see out

a driver's side window. Mayhem:

Cary, behind him, actually answers him:

Sako Bolt Action, 30-06

(pronounced: thirty-aut-six) -- okay okay okay, I get it --

Leathwood Art Scope--

Hernandez makes a radio call, Overmyer straining to see out

the windows as Nelec locks and loads the unique ammo and

moves to a driver's side window, tries to see --

-- repeat, contact with

precious cargo, thirty clicks -- sir, I do not have visual -

from center of town, - Driver, can you see

currently headed for Base anything?

-- send support immediately! No sir, nothing!

Despite his handcuffs, Charles desperately tries to unlatch

his seatbelt with his shaking hands -- Cary sees this:

PUSH IN on Cary, to CLOSEUP, looking PAST CAMERA, TERRIFIED --

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM THE DARK

LIKE A GHOST THROUGH BLACK VELVET -- HIT BY THE HEADLIGHTS,

IT ROARS AT SUCH A PITCH AND VOLUME THAT THE WINDSHIELD

SPIDERS! It's out of the light and gone again -- PUSH IN ON

NELEC -- newly terrified, he hands his TRACKING RIFLE to

Overmyer is stunned for a moment, but hides it well:

Reluctant as hell, for a tense beat, the Driver pulls the

controls: the door HISSES LOUDLY as it opens.

In the back, the boys are all frozen for a moment, watching.

Overmyer moves for the door. Five feet away from the door, he

stops, turns back to Nelec:

KKKKRRRRRASSHHH!!!! THE THING REACHES IN -- SHATTERS THE DOOR

-- the Driver SCREAMS -- the thing GRABS OVERMYER, who DROPS

THE RIFLE -- IT FIRES -- the projectile HITS THE SAFETY GLASS

IN FRONT OF THE BOYS AS OVERMYER, GRABBED, BLOOD IN HIS

MOUTH, TRIES TO HOLD ONTO THE SEATS, REACHING FOR NELEC, WHO

DOES NOTHING -- OVERMYER IS VIOLENTLY YANKED OUT OF THE BUS --

Joe IN SHOCK -- Behind him, Martin VOMITS.

CHARLES SCRAMBLES to unlatch his seatbelt --

BAAAM!!! The bus is SLAMMED SO HARD --

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

The BUS IS PUSHED TWENTY FEET FROM SOMETHING ON THE OTHER

SIDE -- THEN IT TIPS OVER AND CRASHES TO THE GROUND:

INT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT

Windows SHATTER -- Charles and Cary -- seatbelts removed --

LAND ON JOE AND MARTIN! The THREE SOLDIERS hit the window-

floor painfully -- Hernandez so hard he's INSTANTLY

UNCONSCIOUS! THE BUS IS NOW MOTIONLESS ON ITS SIDE, OPEN DOOR

UP. Nelec rises. Scared, but pissed.

The REAR WHEELS of the bus SCREAM in rotation -- we

COUNTERMOVE with the creature as it COMES AROUND the other

side, CLIMBS onto the exposed side -- METAL AND WINDOW

The boys gather their wits -- LIGHTS FLASHING HAUNTINGLY --

Joe moves to the locked bulletproof glass door -- tries the

handle -- but it's never gonna open.

On the OTHER side of the glass, Nelec rights himself,

momentarily disoriented -- breathing heavily, he moves away

from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the

kids; he tries the handle, but it won't open for him either.

And there is Joe and Nelec, face-to-face -- Joe seeing the

fear in Nelec's eyes -- his understanding that this is his

fate. Somehow Nelec takes this moment to look into Joe's face

-- to silently -- in a look -- repent. Instantly, Joe knows

he's about to watch this man's life end.

SMASH! Nelec turns -- the creature is BUSTING the bus door --

SMASHING AT IT -- to make it BIGGER. So it can get inside.

The Driver's LEG IS CAUGHT -- he's trying to get out, but

cannot -- is PANICKING -- as SSSSTAB!!! The creature KILLS

HIM INSTANTLY and SMASH as again it tries to WIDEN the door.

Nelec WINCES -- the only conscious man on this side of the

glass; the boys COWER on their side, with each monstrous hit,

all their eyes on Nelec -- except Joe, who only wants to get

to Alice. He sees the SHATTERED BULLETPROOF WINDOW -- above

them, on what has become the "roof" of the bus.

The boys struggle to get Joe onto Martin's shoulders as, on

the other side of the glass, Nelec scrambles for Hernandez's

fallen SEMI-AUTO RIFLE. He grabs it and scampers back to the

glass as SMASH!!! Pieces of metal and glass BURST like ice

chips as the creature violently WIDENS the bus door opening--

On Charles' shoulders, Joe can reach the shattered-but-thick

window -- which he must HIT -- BREAK OPEN to get out --

essentially exactly what the creature is doing, in reverse.

Using both fists, Joe POUNDS the window. No give.

Harder! Come on, you PUSSY!!!

With all his might, Joe hits the window again -- the

SLIGHTEST sound of glass adjusting -- meanwhile, SLAM!!! The

creature BUSTING the bus door -- PRYING it wider like a

sardine can -- NELEC SITS AGAINST THE GLASS AND OPENS FIRE,

FUTILELY, ON THE CREATURE. He makes a CALL on his walkie:

-- and he drops the walkie and FIRES AGAIN -- the LOUD

GUNFIRE BARELY AUDIBLE behind the glass with the boys as Joe

hits the glass again -- BAM -- a CRINKLING of glass --

Joe hits again -- so does the creature -- as Nelec RUNS OUT

OF AMMO. That was never really hope anyway. Joe hits again

and CRASH! The window SHATTERS! Glass chunks RAIN DOWN on the

boys -- all covering their face -- Cary seeing the CREATURE

STARTING TO ENTER THE BUS --

With all the boys helping, Joe pulls himself up -- outside

the bus, Joe peeks out -- the fucking creature -- its back to

Joe -- just fifteen feet away, focused on the door -- and Joe

strains to climb out here, onto the top-side of the bus.

And as the boys climb out, the creature climbs in -- first

Joe, then Charles (AD LIB DIALOGUE WITH CARY AND MARTIN: "You

gotta lose some weight --" "I know!!!"), Then Cary, and

Martin last -- they all jump down to the dirt -- they hear

SCREAMS and turn back for a moment --

Inside the bus, Nelec watches as the creature ENTERS THE

TIGHT-FITTING BUS, SMASHING BENCHES, MAKING ITS WAY

TERRIFYINGLY DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD HIM. And as the creature

descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge --

Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified:

Before he can finish, the creature fucking ATTACKS -- and it

would be horrible and brutal, if the BLOOD DIDN'T SPRAY UPON

THE BULLETPROOF GLASS -- WHICH OUR CAMERA IS SAFELY BEHIND --

OBSCURING THE NIGHTMARISH VIEW.

In the field, a distance away, the boys watch the bus SHUDDER

and SHAKE. Then... silence. They see the creature burst out

of the bus -- then RUN OFF -- fast and stealthy, away from

them in the overgrown grass, like a native hunter. Which, of

course, is partly what it is. They're sort of stunned.

INT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - NIGHT

Louis stares off, lost. Two AIR FORCE SOLDIERS arrive:

Standing is hard for heartsick Louis, his legs so hurt --

suddenly JACK IS THERE, acting the role of Air Force:

As the two Soldiers head off, Jack wraps Louis' arm over his

shoulders, heads off in the other direction, as Louis looks

him over, confused:

On LOUIS' FACE -- a surprised glimmer of HOPE --

EXT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT

Moments later, TIGHT on a POCKET -- Joe pulls out his

MOTHER'S NECKLACE. WIDEN to see that he's taken the necklace

from Overmyer's dead body. Cary holds up his backpack.

They turn: a car comes, fast -- PUSH IN ON JOE who studies

the oncoming car, as behind him:

The car ARRIVES: It's DONNY. He gets out of his car, wild-

and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them:

Donny looks at Joe, like it hurts to think.

EXT. LILLIAN SUBURB STREET - NIGHT

The Catalina cruises fast through the deserted neighborhood --

INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT

Joe drives, Donny is ASLEEP. Other boys in the back.

SUDDENLY, BOOM!!! A DEAFENING, CONCUSSIVE GUNBLAST! They're

LIT UP by what they see ahead: in the oncoming cross-street,

TANKS -- TWO OF THEM -- AND A ROCKET-LAUNCHING VEHICLE FIRE

AGAIN AND AGAIN AT SOMETHING WE CAN'T YET SEE! The boys COVER

THEIR EARS -- Donny awakens, but only for a moment --

Joe quickly turns left into a driveway -- but we PUSH IN

TIGHT ON HIM -- from the direction they just came are MORE

TANKS AND MILITARY VEHICLES -- Joe's eyes go wide -- they're

stuck. GUNFIRE CONTINUES!

Joe and the boys get out of the car fast and RUN across the

street, zig-zagging between the enormous MILITARY VEHICLES --

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Soldier hurries off.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

Joe in the lead - they turn and look back -- a massive shot

of the neighborhood under fire -- houses getting BLOWN TO

SHIT in collateral damage.

An EXPLOSION HITS TOO CLOSE -- the boys SCREAM as they run

BETWEEN HOUSES -- and WE TRACK WITH THEM -- four boys racing

through a neighborhood under siege -- power GOES OUT -- and

some explosions are much closer than others -- another BIG

HIT and they go to a back door of a house -- and go inside --

INT. NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE - NIGHT

-- they run in for cover -- they're silhouetted in this dark

space by the EXPLOSION LIGHT emanating from the windows.

They're all out of breath in a strange KITCHEN --

Another CRAZY LOUD AND BRIGHT EXPLOSION -- the light fixtures

sway. Charles grabs a coke on the counter.

Charles-- that's not yours-- -- what?! I'm thirsty and I'm

Another fucking LOUD BLAST -- sound of GLASS BREAKING -- and

the creature ROARING --

And there it is, in silhouette, moving past the bay window --

Joe realizes: where the creature is, so are the blasts:

Joe runs -- the others follow --

But as they get to the living room a HUGE EXPLOSION BLOWS OUT

A WALL! They all go down -- but Martin is in agony all of a

sudden -- his leg RIPPED by concrete. If there's good news

here, the creature has left this area -- the explosions

getting further away. But there's blood and Martin is in real

pain.

Charles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on

the wall that now has a HOLE in it; MILITARY VEHICLES can be

seen driving past outside. Joe hands Charles the thick fabric

tie -- which Charles fashion into a tourniquet, wraps it

around Martin's leg, tight --

Charles looks at Martin -- can't argue. Says, sincerely:

Charles nods -- Joe looks to Cary:

Joe nods, determined, and he and Cary head off --

Martin screams.

Joe and Cary run through the semi-demolished neighborhood,

many houses shattered, some cars obliterated. The only lone

figures in town.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Joe and Cary stop, out of breath, at the graves.

Joe and Cary run through the graveyard and over to the

CARETAKER'S SHED.

EXT./INT. CEMETERY CARETAKER'S SHED - NIGHT

They're out of breath -- they try ONE garage door, windows

CAKED WITH DIRT. Stuck. The SECOND door. Dirt-caked windows.

Stuck. The third is a barn door -- they try it: locked.

The two begin KICKING the door together -- on three -- one --

two -- CRASH! Again and again, until finally the door KICKS

OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness

they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking STRAIGHT DOWN

FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been

DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED,

caked along the sides of the structure. The boys catch their

breath.

Cary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER.

LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN. The thing falls far

enough to tell them it's too far to jump.

But burning on the dirt floor of the nearly-dug hole, it

lights up a TUNNEL at the bottom.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

A JEEP roars past.

INT. JEEP - NIGHT

Jack drives fast. Louis sits beside him. It's awkward. But

not angry. Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad:

Jack looks at him for a moment, then back to the road. A

beat. Finally:

Jack glances at him. A small nod of forgiveness and

gratitude. Louis wants to cry again, but just accepts it.

INT. SHED - NIGHT

Joe begins CLIMBING DOWN the ROPE.

INT. CEMETERY SHED HOLE - NIGHT

Joe lands on the bottom. Dark as hell -- looks up -- at Cary

climbing down into the hole -- the barn roof looming above

him. Now Cry lands too. There are THREE POSSIBLE WAYS TO GO.

Joe's mind races about which way to go.

We HEAR a DISTANT RUMBLING -- like something far off, but

MECHANICAL. Then:

They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, a TALL OVAL

TUNNEL, TWENTY FEET TALL --

INT. TUNNEL #1 (W/FURNIURE) - NIGHT

We're SO FAR AWAY, that the screen is mostly black, with a

small speck of SPARKLY LIGHT.

They come to an area LITTERED WITH THE STUFF OF A LIVING

ROOM. They look up: ANOTHER HOLE LEADING DOWN, DUG STRAIGHT

THROUGH A HOUSE. They continue, coming to an INTERSECTION --

where a NEW TUNNEL branches off.

INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT

There's DIM LIGHT from up ahead, where the tunnel BENDS. The

RUMBLING/MECHANICAL SOUND LOUDER now. Joe and Cary slowly

move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and

amazes them all at once.

IT'S A HUNDRED-FOOT DIAMETER, FORTY-FOOT TALL UNDERGROUND

SPACE, FILLED WITH A MECHANICAL MARVEL -- A MASSIVE, BIZARRE

CONTRAPTION COMBINING THOUSANDS OF MECHANICAL PIECES, FROM

THE MISSING MICROWAVES, CAR ENGINES, ANTENNAS, AND COUNTLESS

OTHER DEVICES -- WIRES AND CABLES HANG AND CONNECT

EVERYWHERE, ALL LEADING TO THE DIRT CEILING, HEADING UP, TO

SOMEWHERE ABOVE GROUND. THE THICK-WITH-FUMES SPACE CHUGS AND

HUMS WITH A SLOWLY INCREASING PITCH, AS IT IT'S WARMING UP,

GETTING READY TO FINALLY, ACTUALLY WORK.

They cross to the other side. Cary bumps into a HANGING

SHERIFF PRUITT. Cary is about to scream, but Joe puts a hand

on his mouth and leads him away from Pruitt.

Makeshift HANGING BULBS provide some light; a number of other

TUNNELS are visible from here, too. Joe and Cary look at the

space in disbelief.

Then Joe sees something that makes him grab at Cary's shirt.

Cary looks: THROUGH THE MASS OF METAL AND MACHINERY AND

DANGLING CABLES, AT THE OTHER END OF THIS UNDERGROUND

EXPERIMENT, IS THE CREATURE. HUNCHED OVER. BACK TO THE BOYS.

AND IT'S SAVAGELY EATING SOMETHING. IT MOVES A BIT: WE SEE

IT'S A HUMAN LEG. Joe and Cary would SCREAM if they didn't

need to stay quiet. In a panicked WHISPER:

Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other

side of the machinery -- and there he sees, in an INSET

section of the rock-wall, THREE HUMAN BODIES, HANGING

LIFELESS FROM THEIR FEET, WRAPPED IN SOME KIND OF THIN

SHELLAC. TIGHT ON JOE as he sees, among them, ALICE. His

heart POUNDS, his resolve quadruples. Cary sees her too --

But Joe's already gone. Stay with Cary, who opens his

backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of EXPLOSIVES,

glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view --

INT. TUNNEL #3 - NIGHT

MOVE FAST with Joe as he races, a LIT SPARKLER giving him his

light -- the MECHANICAL RUMBLING all but gone now. Joe runs,

looking for another way into the creature's massive space --

he finally finds another INTERSECTION -- he turns into it --

he disappears down the tunnel --

INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT

Cary's made a long, insane pile of FIRECRACKERS -- he uses an

OPEN M-80 and begins laying a SQUIGGLY, LONG LINE OF GUN

POWDER back, away from the firecrackers -- away from the

entrance to the creature's CONTRAPTION space.

INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT

Joe races down the dirt tunnel, the SOUND OF THE MECHANICAL

RUMBLING -- and its INCREASING PITCH -- getting LOUDER. The

SPARKLER DIES as LIGHT BEGINS TO REVEAL JOE, who slows --

peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the OTHER

SIDE of the space. He sees the creature -- then looks across

to the lifeless body of Alice. His heart sinks.

INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT

Cary's done laying out the charges -- he pulls out his

lighter -- FFFT! FFFT! The damn thing won't light --

FFT! FFT! No go -- he keeps trying.

INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT

Joe watches as the creature FINISHES WITH ITS MEAL AND HEADS

FOR THE OTHER HANGING BODIES -- PUSH IN ON JOE, DESPERATE --

INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT

Cary frantically trying the lighter -- FFT! FFT! FFT!

He looks up -- watches the creature GRAB AND PULL ALICE'S

LIFELESS BODY DOWN FROM HER HANGING POSITION -- it moves with

her to where he was eating the teacher -- Cary SHAKES THE

LIGHTER, STARTING TO CRY AND HE FLICKS IT AND FFFFFTH!!! IT

LIGHTS! HE TOUCHES IT ON THE GUN POWDER AND RUNS OFF --

INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT

The creature PULLS AWAY the fibrous covering over Alice --

its TENTACLES SLITHER OUT.

INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT

Watching this is horror, Joe's about to run in just as

BABABABABABABABAM!!! The creature JERKS UP from its almost-

meal of Alice, looks toward the EXPLOSIVE SOUNDS, then LEAVES

HER, quickly moving for the tunnel --

INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT

The creature arrives in the SMOKE-FILLED TUNNEL, as the

FIREWORKS FILL the tunnel with BRIGHT, MULTI-COLORED LIGHTS --

INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT

Joe SPRINTS in, gets to Alice -- lightly slaps her face --

Nothing -- so he fucking SLAPS HER FACE HARD and she suddenly

INHALES SHARPLY, he eyes WIDE, terrified --

She's CATCHING HER BREATH, nodding, looking at him, amazed --

She GRABS HIM AND HUGS HIM TIGHT, teary and grateful --

during which -- quietly:

But she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense:

TINA, a 24-year-old , disoriented woman with curlers in her

hair, wakes up.

INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT

Joe and Alice have helped down one FAMILIAR FACE: SHERIFF

PRUITT. They're out of breath, but their survival instinct

has kicked in:

Joe and Alice follow. They run into a tunnel. We PUSH IN ON

THE MECHANICAL DEVICE -- the PITCH INCREASING MORE NOW -- AS

IF IT'S ABOUT TO "FUNCTION" -- The creature returns and sees

that the humans are gone. He takes off.

INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT

Sparkler lighting the way, we're with Joe and Alice -- Pruitt

and Tina behind them:

They continue following Pruitt.

BUT HE'S LOOKING BACK AND HIS SPARKLER ILLUMINATES THE

CREATURE THAT IS RIGHT UP AHEAD AND TINA SCREAMS -- THEY ALL

DO AS PRUITT TURNS AND IS TAKEN, LIFTED HIGH, KILLED IN THE

DARK AS THEY ALL TURN AND RUN -- PRUITT'S HORRIBLE SCREAMS

terrifying as the foursome sprint in the opposite direction!

After RUNNING HARD for a beat:

They haul ass, but after a long moment TINA IS GRABBED AWAY

INTO THE DARKNESS!!! HER SCREAMS CONTINUE behind them --

They run and run and run, but then BOOM: they hit a DEAD END.

A DIRT WALL. No more tunnels. No options. Out of breath, they

turn -- but dare not go back toward the horrifying blackness.

The only SOUND the sparkler, their erratic breathing and the

DISTANT INCREASING PITCH OF THE CREATURE'S MECHANICAL DEVICE.

THE CREATURE IS THERE -- FORTY FEET FROM THEM, --

APPROACHING! ALICE SCREAMS -- SHE AND CARY MORE BACK AGAINST

THE WALL -- AND THE CREATURE MOVES FOR THEM, BUT JOE YELLS AS

THE THING PASSES THE FIREWORKS:

IT KEEPS COMING -- PAST THE FIREWORKS, AMAZINGLY BACKLIT AS

IT LUMBERS TOWARD JOE, DESPERATELY TRYING TO STAND GROUND:

AND IT GRABS JOE AND LIFTS HIM -- Alice and Cary SCREAM AS

JOE IS BEING SQUEEZED -- HE LOOKS INTO THE GLOSSY BLACK EYES

OF THIS BEAST, WHICH COULD KILL HIM AT ANY TIME -- but in

this moment of fear comes something else. Simple truth -- he

WHISPERS, SHAKILY:

JUST AS WE THINK THE CREATURE'S GONNA KILL HIM: A DISTANT

MECHANICAL TONE -- THE CREATURE TURNS, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT

SOUND -- THEN TO JOE AGAIN. IT CONSIDERS HIM. ITS EYES'

COVERING PEELS AWAY -- REVEALING HUGE, WET, VULNERABLE EYES.

AND THE THING LOOKS AT HIM. REALLY LOOKS AT HIM. In a way, as

you imagine his mother once had. And Joe feels this too. AND

AFTER A LONG, SCARY BEAT, THE CREATURE SETS HIM DOWN. Joe

backs up as the creature TURNS FAST AND SPEEDS AWAY. JOE IS

STUNNED. SHOCKED RELIEF. ALICE AND CARY, TOO --

Then, over the HIGH-PITCHED MECHANICAL SOUND comes RUMBLINGS -

- like THUNDER from above -- and the three LOOK UP --

EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT

The kids round a corner -- ON MAIN STREET, COUNTLESS METALLIC

OBJECTS -- ANYTHING METAL AND LOOSE -- has been INVISIBLY

DRAGGED -- FLOATING -- toward the WATER TOWER -- at different

speeds and with different personalities, metal objects BULLET

TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER AND STICK THERE.

Suddenly, THE DINER WINDOW SHATTERS as a STOVE RIPS THROUGH

IT -- we PAN WITH IT as it TUMBLES TOWARD AND UP THE WATER

TOWER! HUNDREDS OF OBJECTS move past them -- from bicycles to

silverware and sinks! DISHWASHERS AND TVS SMASH THROUGH THE

TOWN'S APPLIANCE STORE WINDOW -- A TV FLOATS, UNPLUGGED, PAST

THE KIDS -- AND IT IS ON -- AND SHOWS AN EPISODE FROM THE

TWILIGHT ZONE -- all things eventually SLAMMING into the

WATER TOWER, the objects BEGINNING TO CRUSH TOGETHER, FORMING

ONE DENSE METALLIC MASS!

BAM! BAMBAM! Sounds like GUN BLASTS -- the KIDS TURN: behind

them are the RED CARGO CONTAINERS -- ONE BY ONE those cubes

BURST THROUGH THE CONTAINERS: BAM! BAMBAMBAM! BAMBAM! And

they SLAM INTO THE WATER TOWER -- AND THEY BEGIN TO FORM AN

ODD, HUGE CRESCENT SHAPE ABOVE THE TOWER! Alice is cry-

laughing at seeing it work --

AGAIN and AGAIN, pieces FLY OVERHEAD, beginning to FORM WHAT

IS CLEARLY AN ALIEN CRAFT -- LIGHTS BEGINNING TO ILLUMINATE

FROM INSIDE as it continues -- ONE OF THE SPOTLIGHTS

ILLUMINATING A JEEP THAT HAS JUST ARRIVED: JACK GETS OUT. HE

SEES JOE. JOE IS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM -- ALICE CONCERNED.

BUT THEN THE KIDS ARE BOTH INCREDULOUS TO SEE JACK HELP LOUIS

OUT OF THE JEEP -- THE TWO MEN MOVE THROUGH THE DEBRIS IN THE

STREETS, STUNNED AT THE ACTIVITY SURROUNDING THEM, BUT

FOCUSED ON THEIR CHILDREN; A TUMBLING TYPEWRITER ALMOST TAKES

OUT JACK, BUT HE AVOIDS IT AS IT SHOOTS UP TO THE WATER

TOWER.

JACK GETS TO HIS SON -- HOLDS HIS SHOULDERS -- LOOKS DEEPLY

INTO HIS EYES, TOUCHES HIS FACE AND EMBRACES HIM --

LOUIS, CRYING, DESPERATELY SORRY -- AND SHE SEES THIS IN HIS

SAD, WOUNDED FACE -- SHE HOLDS OUT A HAND -- HE TAKES IT AND

PULLS HER INTO AN EMBRACE, HUGGING HIS DAUGHTER DESPERATELY.

BEHIND THEM, THE SHIP CONTINUES TO TAKE SHAPE, ALMOST FULLY-

FORMED -- but here, as he is being hugged by his father, Joe

LOOKS DOWN: SOMETHING IN HIS POCKET Is MOVING -- he considers

it, confused for a moment -- but he reaches in and pulls it

out. HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE -- and he holds the chain, but the

LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting to go.

Joe knows what this means. He looks up at his father, who

also understand. AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION --

FROM HERE UNTIL THE END. After a long beat, Joe HOLDS THE

NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING... TEARS

in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go,

but knowing he must. Jack, heartsick, watches his son, on the

verge of letting go. Alice watches Joe, on the verge of tears

-- except Joe just can't bring himself to do it, not now, not

ever. But then something happens.

Pulled by the invisible force, THE LOCKET POPS OPEN. And we

see what's inside. A PHOTOGRAPH of Joe's MOTHER. A young

woman, HOLDING HER ONE SMALL BABY. And Joe looks at his

mother -- and in this moment, she at him and Jack's eyes

suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice, too, tears streaming down

her face and finally Jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on

his son's shoulder -- which was all Joe needed, really.

And finally... after all... JOE LETS GO. OUR SCORE SOARS AS,

IN SLOW MOTION, the necklace SHOOTS ACROSS THE MAIN STREET UP

TO THE WATER TOWER!

AND WHEN IT HITS, THE ENTIRE TOWER IMPLODES FROM PRESSURE --

A FIREWORKS-LIKE EXPLOSION OF WATER BURSTS AND SHOWERS THE

STREET AS THE MAJESTIC SHIP COMPLETES ITS FORMATION -- and

that's when Joe sees the CREATURE, LEAVING -- CLIMBING UP THE

WATER TOWER AND ENTERS HIS SHIP -- AND IT BEGINS TO LIFT. AS

IT TAKES OFF, THE WEIGHT OF THE TOWER IS TOO MUCH: IT

COLLAPSES INTO MAIN STREET.

THE SHIP RISES SLOWLY INTO THE SKY -- ITS PURE WHITE

SPOTLIGHTS FINALLY SCANNING THE GROUND BENEATH IT -- LILLIAN,

OHIO -- EARTH -- A PLANET IT IS FINALLY LEAVING --

INT./EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

And we PUSH IN on Charles and Marin, who watch, amazed, as

the distant light RISES INTO THE SKY --

EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

And we PUSH IN as DONNY SLEEPS, the REFLECTION OF THE RISING

SHIP seen in his windshield --

EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Joe and Alice, Jack, Louis and Cary watch, amazed, as the

ship disappears into the night sky, we are TIGHT ON JOE'S

HAND, as it takes ALICE'S.

And looking skyward, Joe smiles.

As our SCORE SWELLS, we finally...
