Hot Tub Time Machine Theme

Lyrics by Josh Heald

Music by Def Leppard, Styx, Journey, Poison, or Whitesnake

Water cranked to a hundred and three

Got my tunes, my snacks, my booze, my skis

(Got the) freshest moves you ever seen

When I'm soakin in my Hot Tub Time Machine

When you're going back to the 80s...

And you might be fuckin some ladies...

You bring your button fly jeans and some sweet hair gel

Want blow? All you gotta do is yell

(Yeah you're) lookin real smooth, (and you're) lookin real mean

When you're soakin in your Hot Tub Time Machine

Yeah!

Hot Tub - Time Machine!

Hot Tub - Time Machine!

C'mon!

That's the 54 jets workin' on your spine

When you roll up in your Hot Tub Time Machine

Yeah your shirt's a little psychedelic...

And you're lookin kinda like Tom Selleck...

Yeah the chicks are wetter than the Everglades

But double bag your dude, don't wanna get AIDS

Just listen right up, consider me your dean

In the college of the Hot Tub Time Machine

Yeah!

Hot Tub - Time Machine!

Hot Tub - Time Machine!

Yeah!

EXT. POOL DECK - DAY

BLUE SKIES. A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY.

CAMERA PANS DOWN to reveal A HOT TUB FULL OF HOT CHICKS IN

BIKINIS. They splash about playfully. Then--

A FUCKING LION JUMPS IN THE HOT TUB!

As the girls SCREAM and scramble for safety, the BEAST ROARS

and it becomes the:

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

ADAM COLEMAN (late 30s, good-looking, sweet-natured face) is

in a great mood as he packs a SUITCASE.

LILY (O.S.)

Ready for the wildest bachelor

party of all time?

LILY (early 30s, shirt and jeans, hot in a smart and classy

sense) walks in the room, smiling.

You know it. I'm gonna bang all

sorts of chicks this weekend!

That's not the answer I was looking

for.

Sorry, honey.

Adam gives his beautiful fiancee a playful kiss.

She shows him some PHOTOS.

Look what I found...

2.

A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS and 20-SOMETHINGS PARTY IN A LARGE HOT

TUB at a SKI RESORT. It looks like the most fun ever.

Check out that young stud. Can you

believe he's about to get married?

Lily and Adam look through more PHOTOS of a YOUNG ADAM (17)

partying at a SKI RESORT with his FRIENDS:

-- In full 80s SKI GEAR on a mountain...

-- Eating PIZZA at "Papa Enzo's," stuffing their faces...

-- Drinking BEERS at the "Brew Haus," an awesome pub...

-- In the HOT TUB with SIX GIRLS...

Adam snatches the last photo from her.

Ignore that one. Nothing happened.

I love you.

Lily laughs.

Adam, you didn't know me yet.

As Adam goes back to packing, Lily leafs through some more of

the photos. She stops at one and her EXPRESSION CHANGES.

Who's this?

Lily shows Adam a PHOTO:

-- A SMOKING HOT SKI BUNNY (23, blonde, svelte, leg warmers).

I'm not sure.

Really?

Lily shows Adam another PHOTO:

-- YOUNG ADAM with his arm around the SKI BUNNY, who looks

like she was ambushed for the photo.

3.

Oh! Jennie.

Who's Jennie?

She's nobody. Ski instructor.

(off her look)

You didn't know me yet.

Lily still looks at him a little hard.

Lily, I was 17. She had boobs and

a face. Of course I'm gonna take

her picture.

Lily still looks a little bothered.

Do you still think of her?

Of course not! I think of you.

As Adam goes to EMBRACE her:

Hold on...

Lily goes into the CLOSET.

Sweetie?

She comes out a moment later with a CARDBOARD BOX, which she

empties onto the BED. About FIFTY PORNO MAGAZINES spill out,

ranging from TITS MONTHLY to BLACK ASS.

How did you know where I hid my...

treasure?

Lily carefully picks up a BROCHURE from the pile, holding it

by the corner, not wanting to touch it.

Explain this.

From ADAM'S POV, we see the brochure:

-- A ski brochure featuring Jennie on the cover.

4.

OK! You caught me! I

occasionally... reminisce... about

Jennie O'Keefe!

That's gross.

What's "occasionally?"

(without missing a beat)

About two hours ago when you were

on the phone with your mother.

Jesus. Tell me how I'm supposed to

let you go to your bachelor party

and not be a basket case?

What are you so worried about?

I'm worried that you're still

thinking about this girl.

Baby, the girl in that picture was

nothing more than a crush. I could

never get her and there's no

possibility I'll ever be with her.

She was a total stranger.

Lily gets a CURIOUS LOOK on her face.

So... you're into strangers?

Well not the creepy "your mom was

in an accident, now come with me"

kind. But yeah, the hot lady in

the supermarket kind of stranger.

You have to admit - it's kinda hot.

So you're saying if you and I

didn't know each other, it would be

pretty hot if we fooled around?

You kidding me? It would be

fucking incredible.

5.

Lily smiles seductively, as Adam starts to get it.

Wait a minute. Are you

suggesting... yes. YES!

Adam excitedly heads for the door.

OK, I'll go down the hall. You get

into character.

(points at her)

This fucking rules.

Adam leaves the room and Lily REMOVES HER SHIRT, talking sexy

and slowly building the fantasy...

Oh I'm all alone in this big house.

Cheerleading camp just ended and I

need to get out of these sweaty

clothes...

ADAM (O.S.)

Love where you're going with this,

baby! Keep it up!

She unbuttons her pants and SLIDES DOWN HER JEANS.

Mmmm. My panties are so tight

against my firm naked body...

ADAM (O.S.)

You should probably take them off!

Are you gonna let me do this?

ADAM (O.S.)

Sorry! Continue! You were just

about to take off your panties!

She slowly slides out of her panties, kicking them away. Now

she's TOTALLY NAKED. She continues to role play.

It feels so good to be so naked. I

hope no one can see me...

Just then a BLACK MAN (late 30s, handsome, J Crew) saunters

through the bedroom door, holding a coffee and all riled up.

6.

OK, so this asshole in front of me

at the donut place is -- WHOA!

Lily covers up and SCREAMS.

Get out of here!!

He SPILLS the coffee on his hands and their rug as he turns.

Fuck! Ow! I'm sorry. I'll clean

it up. That's gonna stain, though.

Just leave!

He heads for the door, just as:

Adam comes in, wearing a MAILMAN hat and NOTHING ELSE.

Special delivery for -- Jesus

Christ!

The black man doesn't know which way to look. He covers his

eyes and drips coffee, as he blindly steps toward the door.

Just tell me when I'm in the clear.

EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY

Adam wheels his suitcase down the front path of this modest,

well-kept suburban home, as a recovered, dressed, embarrassed

and somewhat shell-shocked Lily follows with a small bag.

They both stop 10 yards short of a RANGE ROVER, where the

black man, NICK, waits in the car, waving.

I can't wait for you to come back

and marry me. Wow, that's crazy.

Adam looks almost like it just hit him.

7.

Yeah.

Wow.

Tell me again I have nothing to

worry about.

Babe, look at Nick...

In the car, Nick air drums to whatever's on the radio.

You think with him in charge, we're

gonna get into any kind of trouble?

We'll probably eat too much pizza

and I'll twist my ankle getting off

the ski lift.

OK. Have an awesome bachelor

party. Not too awesome.

(hands him bag)

I got you something.

Adam looks in the bag.

Sandwich. Thanks.

He puts it in his BACKPACK. She looks like she was expecting

a different reaction, but she lets it go. He kisses her.

Let me see your phone.

He takes it out.

I told you, I'll call you when--

She snatches it out of his hands. Adam looks confused, as

she pockets the phone.

Despite my anxiety, I'm not gonna

be one of those women who wants an

update every ten minutes. Even

though I do want an update every

ten minutes.

Adam smiles. Lily looks a bit trepidatious.

8.

Just make sure whatever happens,

you're back for the rehearsal

dinner.

I totally trust you.

You should. I'm a lame-o.

Well at least you're a cute lame-o.

Lily leans in and they NUZZLE their noses together in a

disgusting display of affection. A FLASH goes off.

From the car, Nick holds up his iPhone.

I'm more than willing to forget

about earlier, but this shit's

going on Facebook.

INT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING

Nick drives through SUBURBIA, while Adam rides shotgun.

I have no idea what Facebook is.

My phone has a button that says

Send To Facebook. I've been

sending shit there for months.

Adam looks out the window, smiling.

I'm so psyched about this weekend!

Ditto, buddy. I'm gonna help you

make up for all the good times you

missed when you were being a

responsible member of society.

You're a good friend. I'm sorry

for putting my career and self

sufficiency above bowling night.

This trip represents everything

awesome about being a dude.

9.

We're gonna drink too much, eat

whatever we want...

I might not even change my socks.

Live the dream.

Best of all, we don't have to

answer to anyone.

Nick's PHONE rings and he answers it with his built-in

BLUETOOTH. His phone voice is a little more "sensitive."

NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)

Hi honey.

COURTNEY (V.0.)

Three goddamn bags of pretzels?

NICK (ON PHONE)

(trying to save face)

I'm with Adam, honey.

COURTNEY (V.0.)

Hi Adam.

(a little calmer)

Nick, what have I told you about

buying snacks that aren't on sale?

NICK (ON PHONE)

You said not to do it.

COURTNEY (V.0.)

And what did you do?

NICK (ON PHONE)

I bought three bags of pretzels.

But I'm gonna eat them...

COURTNEY (V.0.)

That's not the point.

Don't do it again.

Nick and Adam exchange an embarrassing glance.

NICK (ON PHONE)

OK.

COURTNEY (V.0.)

Call me from the road. Adam, say

hi to Lily.

10.

ADAM (ON PHONE)

OK, I sure wi--

CLICK. For a moment, there is an uncomfortable silence.

Don't her parents own the

supermarket?

The whole damn chain.

Just be thankful Lily doesn't have

any family money. Nothing makes

your dick softer.

EXT. MOTEL -- DAY

Nick's car pulls into the lot of a rundown motel.

INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - DAY

Adam looks confused and slightly nervous.

This looks like a place where

people die. Mostly from murder.

A BALD, miserable-looking GUY in his late 30s (LOU) exits a

room, carrying TWO SHOPPING BAGS. He gets in the back seat.

Adam looks happy to see him.

Lou!

Yes, I'm living in a transient

motel. Let's get that purple

elephant out of the room.

Dude, it looks nice.

Thank you. I hate your guts.

(re: the bags)

What'd you bring?

11.

All my belongings.

So you're sorta like a bum now,

huh?

In a sense.

INT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING

Lou sits in the backseat, voraciously eating a bowl of

cereal, as the other guys are up front.

Our system is fucked, gentlemen.

You tell me how a whore wife can

fuck some black dude - no offense -

and still take her cuckold of a

husband for all he's got.

Why would I take offense to that?

It's offensive.

Because he's black?

And because he's fucking my wife.

And because you're black. And

because of all the oversensitive

horrible garbage... you know what?

Forget no offense. Just offense.

Are you offended?

Not really.

Then shut the fuck up.

She's got a hell of an attorney.

Yes and thank you so very much for

giving her the referral.

12.

She told me it was for a friend.

So... what? Your wife likes black

dick now?

I'm gonna slaughter you in your

sleep tonight.

(turns to Lou, genuine)

Thanks for coming, man.

EXT. UPSCALE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Nick's car pulls up across from a nice apartment building, as

a well-dressed, well-groomed, overly polished-looking YOUNG

GUY in his 20s (JACOB) comes out, carrying a MESSENGER BAG.

INT. NICK'S CAR -- SAME TIME

The guys watch Jacob carefully cross the street.

Oh, Adam's stupid brother's coming?

Boo! Drive away before he gets in

the car!

Be nice. I know Jacob's kind of a

douche, but I'm trying to be closer

to him since Mom died.

Jacob gets in the back next to Lou.

Hey buddy! How's it going? Good

to see you!

You look dirty and you smell bad.

You look gay and you smell like a

basket of fancy soaps. Advantage

me.

How is that to your advantage?

13.

He's not gay. He's just... what

are you again?

Metrosexual.

You have sex with trains?

For your information, I fuck

chicks. Hot ones.

For your information, you fuck

dudes. Gay ones.

Yeah, well at least I'm young and

my life's full of potential. I

hear you're homeless now?

(to Nick and Adam)

You told him?!

I hate all you people.

Will you two please shake hands and

make up? We're gonna be spending a

lot of time together.

Jacob distractedly TEXTS on his phone.

Yeah, about that. Why aren't we

going to Aspen? Vermont's lame.

It's gonna be fun.

Yeah, whatever.

And with that, the guys travel in silence for a few moments,

the lifeblood drained from the car. Finally...

I've gotta take a shit.

14.

INT. BURGER KING REST STOP - DAY

Lou walks from the bathroom back to the TABLE where Adam,

Nick, and Jacob sit and eat.

That was an ugly experience.

I don't wanna hear about it.

In a few years, when I'm dying of

an exotic disease that causes my

penis to bleed until it falls off,

someone remember to tell the

hospital to check out the filthy

crapper at the Albany Rest Stop.

It's the AIDS monkey of toilets.

The guys put down their sandwiches.

Thank you.

I don't know how you're doing it,

man. I mean, Laurie's hot, don't

get me wrong.

Lily.

Right. Lily. But one vagina?

Forever?

That's the sacrifice.

Jacob nods, agreeing with Lou's concern.

And you're OK with that? I don't

know your sexual history, but you

sure you got it out of your system?

I did OK for myself.

He didn't do that well for himself.

15.

Yeah, isn't Lily your fourth?

Fifth. Thank you.

So you're averaging like one girl

every eight years.

Assuming I got laid when I was

zero.

That would be awesome.

Adam gives Lou a distasteful look.

I'm fine. Maybe some cold feet,

but that's normal. Thank you

everyone for your concern.

Just looking out for you. That's

what brothers do, right? They look

out for each other?

(takes a moment)

Is this about something else?

Forget it.

No, let's do this. I'm sorry I

wasn't around when you were growing

up, OK? I was in college. And

then I was working. Dad left.

Someone had to take responsibility.

Boooooring!

Shut up.

I said forget it.

16.

Guys, come on. Let's move past it.

This is gonna be a fun weekend.

I still say Vermont sucks.

You're confusing Vermont with

yourself. This weekend is going to

be incredible and you will not ruin

it for me.

(softens, to Jacob)

You might like it. Havenhurst is

pretty awesome.

Jacob shrugs, but Lou gets excited.

Fuck yeah it is! We're gonna ski

the trail and bone some tail!

You'll have to bone some of that

tail for me, man.

Fuck that. You'll bone your own.

No I won't.

Adam, trust me. Biggest mistake of

my life - not fucking a whore at my

bachelor party.

That's the biggest mistake of your

life?

Fuck yeah. And he's not making

that same mistake.

Uh... I'm not having sex with

anyone this weekend.

Lou looks at Adam, trying to figure things out.

17.

Ohhhh. I gotcha.

You're not having sex this weekend.

I'm not having sex this weekend.

Without the winking.

Right. No winking.

I understand.

I'm pretty sure you don't.

INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING

Nick's car transitions from the HIGHWAY to the MOUNTAINS to

the WOODS, as we track the drive.

Finally, the car passes a "Welcome to Havenhurst" sign.

Gentlemen... welcome to Havenhurst.

Yes!

EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - AFTERNOON

The car winds through the main thoroughfare. Rather than a

quaint ski town, this place resembles a suburban nightmare,

with STRIP MALLS and CHAIN RESTAURANTS. It's the exact

opposite of the fun town we saw in Adam's photos.

INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - AFTERNOON - DRIVING

The guys look out the windows, wearing bummed expressions.

so this is the coolest town ever?

Oh man. The Brew Haus is a PF

Chang's.

Lou notices a TGI Friday's, with a sign advertising a "Hannah

Montana 3-D Experience!" He looks utterly disgusted.

18.

I don't even have the heart to tell

you what I just fucking saw. But

say goodbye to Papa Enzo's. This

town sucks.

What the fuck is going on?

The car climbs a twisty part of the road.

Please god let it still be there...

What?

Pink Paradise. Best strip club

ever.

The car rounds the corner and a SIGN comes into view. The

beginning reads "Pink."

Yes! It lives!

The car continues to climb and the whole sign comes into

view: "Pinkberry."

I wanna die.

Sweet, there's a Pinkberry here.

EXT. PINE VALLEY INN - AFTERNOON

The car pulls into the parking lot of this RUNDOWN lodge.

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - AFTERNOON

The guys walk in and the first thing they notice is a bunch

of CATS that wander anywhere they want.

The large "living room" area off the lobby features a FIRE

PLACE that has been BRICKED SHUT.

TODDLERS and ELDERLY PEOPLE lounge and cry and nap.

19.

What have you done to us?

I'm not playing drinking games with

my grandma.

OK so the place skews a little

older. Let's check in. We're not

spending our time inside anyway.

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

The guys walk silently behind a MIDDLE-AGED BELLHOP (PHIL),

who struggles to wrangle their bags on a shaky hand truck.

His job is made more difficult because he only has ONE ARM.

He grunts and curses his way down the hall on the slow and

laborious journey. But when Adam tries to pick up a bag...

Hey buddy. I'm not gonna tell you

again. I fuckin' got it.

Adam backs off.

This guy's a dick.

No, fuck that.

He's a dick. Oooh tough guy. He's

gotta be Mister America.

Captain America.

Go fuck yourself.

Phil finally drops their bags at their room and then:

I'm ready to be tipped.

20.

You, sir, have no tact.

Nick gives Phil a bill and he walks off down the hall,

leaving the guys outside their room.

Gentlemen... in this room lies the

beginning of our awesome weekend.

Or a continuation of everything

that's sucked so far.

Yeah, I bet it's gonna be lame as

shit in there. The furniture

probably smells like mold.

I say we go to Foxwoods.

I actually kinda like that idea.

Guys!

Everyone looks at Adam.

Let's give it a chance. We don't

know for sure that the room sucks.

Nick nods, appreciating the optimism. He opens the door:

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - AFTERNOON

The room SUCKS. The ancient furniture looks like it smells

like mold and there is nothing redeemable about the place.

OK, so now we know.

The guys drag their bags in and depressingly take stock of

the situation -- presently the dirty old room.

What the hell is with this place?

21.

It's like a Stephen King novel,

except not as cool.

We'll feel a lot better once we hit

the slopes.

Plus, I know there's one thing to

look forward to.

EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - AFTERNOON

On a patio outside their suite, our guys stare at a KICK-ASS

TOP OF THE LINE HOT TUB. Spacious seating, plenty of jets,

underwater lighting. It's amazing.

Adam, Nick, and Lou look energized.

Thank. God.

At least some things never change.

What's the big deal about a hot

tub?

Shame on you.

There's plenty of time for tubbin'.

Let's ski.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - AFTERNOON

At the top of the mountain, Adam, Nick, and Lou look

ridiculous in TIGHT, RETRO-STYLE NEON SKI JUMPSUITS. Jacob,

on a snowboard, is the only one dressed in current attire.

(re: their outfits)

When's the last time you guys

actually went skiing?

It's been a few years.

I think we look good.

22.

Then you're an idiot.

All right, we race down the

mountain. Loser buys first round.

Premium shit only.

You gonna be all right?

What does that mean?

I dunno - do black dudes ski?

Of course black dudes ski. Aren't

I wearing skis?

I'm just not sure you're

representative.

You're calling me an Uncle Tom?

I don't even know what that means.

It means black dudes ski.

(pulls down goggles)

Catch ya at the bottom.

Nick takes off and... gets about 15 FEET, before he hits a

GRASSY PATCH and falls over.

Black dudes don't ski.

How's the bottom?

ADAM HITS A BAD PATCH AND FALLS DOWN.

23.

JACOB AND LOU COLLIDE, BOTH TRYING TO AVOID A BARE PATCH.

NICK PICKS UP SPEED, BEFORE HITTING A BARE PATCH AND FALLING.

A LITTLE OLD LADY SLOWLY SKIS PAST HIM, KICKING UP POWDER.

EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - NIGHT

Nick wears his "going out clothes" and walks along the main

drag talking into his PHONE. It is clear that he is being

CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTED on the other end of the conversation.

NICK (ON PHONE)

No, the black ones... without the

pleats... Because the pleats make

me look fat... No, I put it on the

Amex... Because I'm the best man...

I know, but I'm organizing... I'm

gonna get cash fr-- I'm gonna get--

I'm gonna collect cash from the

guys... Yes... Yes... Yes.

I love you too.

Nick hangs up and we see that Adam, Lou, and Jacob have been

walking with him, listening to his end of the conversation.

Dude...

OK, who's ready to sink their teeth

into a delicious dinner?

INT. P.F. CHANG'S - NIGHT

overzealous WAITER (AIDEN) makes a big production of MIXING

SAUCES, like he's Emeril.

You fellas look like you can handle

some spice. I'm gonna knock it up

a bit... throw some chili sauce in

there... oh yeah, there it is.

This is gonna knock your socks off.

24.

Nick's expression looks like he wants to kill the guy.

Thank you.

The waiter walks away and Nick RAISES HIS GLASS in a toast.

I'd like to propose a toast. To my

best friend, Adam. He may be

throwing his life away, but at

least he's throwing it away with a

hot chick at his side.

The guys LAUGH and clink glasses.

And so what if you only have one

vagina for the rest of your life.

Speaking as someone who's seen your

wife's vagina -- it's definitely

one of the good ones.

Lou and Jacob look confused, but clink glasses anyway, as

Adam mouths "What the fuck" to Nick.

Jacob raises his glass.

To my brother, I say thank you for

including me. I promise to try to

make the most of it.

The guys look confused at the backhanded graciousness.

Thanks for coming, man. It means a

lot to me.

Jacob nods halfheartedly.

To Adam!

To Adam!

The guys hug and clink glasses and excitedly CHATTER. Just

then, a MANAGER appears at the table and CLEARS HIS THROAT.

Gentlemen. You're going to have to

keep it down.

Come on, man. It's our friend's

bachelor party. We're just trying

to roast him a little bit.

Well if you like roasts, I suggest

the roast peking duck. It's out of

this world and as I'm sure Aiden

has told you, he can make it quite

spicy.

The guys look bothered.

But as for the noisy kind of roast,

that's going to have to stop. We

have many other guests trying to

enjoy the P.F. Chang's experience.

The manager walks away. For a moment, the guys are quiet.

Lou takes a bite of his food, chewing slowly.

This kung pau chicken pairs very

nicely with the 97 cab. Very

impressive choice, Nick.

Thank you.

Also, this is the worst bachelor

party I've ever been to.

Everyone puts down their forks, cathartically fed up.

Totally agree.

Nick, look. You had great

intentions. No one's blaming you.

I'm blaming him.

I'm totally blaming him. I didn't

even want to go skiing.

26.

OK I'll admit this trip is not off

to the best start. But we're due

for a victory!

Nick thinks and actually gets an idea. He SNAPS his fingers.

Hot tub!

A lightbulb goes off for Adam too.

Yes!

Lou gets up and throws down his napkin.

Why did we even bother with dinner?

Adam and Nick get up too.

Guys, I'm still hungry.

Quiet, men are talking.

Aiden approaches.

Get you guys some to-go boxes?

I would like you to die. And then

I would like you to leave.

Aiden walks away, freaked out. Lou turns back to the guys.

It's tub time.

EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - NIGHT

Lou, Adam, and Nick all have HUGE SMILES, as they gaze at the

tub. They each hold a TON OF BOOZE.

Jacob looks indifferent and a little turned off by it all.

Lou strips down to his underwear and CLIMBS IN.

Oh my god. The water is perfect.

27.

He POURS A VODKA and SLAMS IT BACK.

Adam climbs in with Lou, pouring his own drink.

I really don't see the appeal.

It's like a glorified bath.

Jacob. Son. The hot tub is the

whole thing! You ski all day.

Then you hit the town, get trashed,

and lure some fine ladies back to

the lodge for some good old

fashioned tubbin'.

Nick CRACKS A BEER and pats Jacob on the back.

So the town's dead? Fine, we skip

that part and go right to the tub.

Trust me. If there's fun to be

had, the tub is a good start.

Nick gets in.

Yes! It's amazing.

Now it's just Jacob outside the hot tub. The other three

guys are already starting to look more energized and happy,

splashing around. After another beat of consideration...

Fuck it.

Jacob strips down and gets in. As he submerges, he actually

starts to loosen up a bit and smiles.

Well?

I'm not convinced this is anything

more than a bath, but it's nice.

Hit him with some bubbles.

Coming right up.

Adam CRANKS A KNOB. As the BUBBLES comes to life, we begin a

TUBBIN' MONTAGE over Reel 2 Real's "I Like to Move It."

28.

-- In the tub, the guys DRINK like fish, pouring various

combinations of VODKA, RED BULL, MOUNTAIN DEW, BACARDI, and

anything else they can get their hands on.

-- Jacob's LAPTOP is propped on the edge of the tub, playing

BETTER OFF DEAD. Every so often, one of our guys takes a

drink, playing a game, the rules of which only they know.

-- Adam takes a big bite of the SANDWICH Lily gave him.

-- Nick uses his iPhone to take video and pictures.

More drinking games. The guys wear funny HATS and roll

dice on a PIECE OF WOOD. Adam has to drink some tub water.

-- The guys keep reaching into ADAM'S BACKPACK for MIXERS.

-- Nick, Adam, and Lou LAUGH. Then, Lou lifts up Jacob's

head, which he has been FORCIBLY HOLDING UNDER WATER. Jacob

coughs and spits out water and looks pissed. Then he smiles

and helps submerge Nick's head in the same way.

-- Slam! Another bottle of vodka killed. Crush! Another

empty Red Bull his the patio.

-- A BEAR eats some DORITOS that have been left on a PICNIC

TABLE. Yards away in the tub, the guys laugh and taunt it.

-- Lou BLEEDS from where the bear has obviously SCRATCHED HIM

across the chest. Still, he dances in the tub.

-- Just for an instant (did we see that?), the guys are 3

BLACK GUYS and ONE WHITE GUY, before changing back.

-- The guys wear their SNOWSUITS in the tub. Adam very

dangerously jumps in, attached to a SNOWBOARD.

-- The CUTS get QUICKER and QUICKER, as hands reach into the

backpack. More vodka. More Dew. More Red Bull. More

Bacardi... The cuts SPEED UP and INTENSIFY until finally in a

BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHT, we

THE SUN RISING JUST ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS.

EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - DAWN

As the light of a new day spills into Havenhurst, we find all

four of our guys PASSED OUT in the hot tub, the water calm.

A KITTEN licks Lou's face. It's adorable. Until...

29.

Lou JOLTS AWAKE and PUKES ON THE KITTEN, sending it FLYING!

This wakes up everyone and they stir to life, inspecting the

carnage, mostly hangover-related.

Oh my god, I wanna die.

I need a vitamin water.

Adam reaches in his backpack, taking out two choices.

Red Bull or Fresca?

Jacob takes the Fresca, as Lou inspects the CLAW MARKS.

That fucking bear got me good.

Yeah he did.

But we showed him, didn't we?

If by showing him, you mean we

laughed and he got bored and

wandered off into the woods with

your sneakers, then yeah, we got

him good.

Fuck yeah.

Lou picks up Adam's half-eaten sandwich and takes a BITE.

You just puked.

That's why I'm eating your

sandwich. I'm fucking starving.

Guys, look...

Their gaze turns to the MOUNTAIN PEAK, on which is a fresh

LAYER OF POWDER. It looks like perfect skiing conditions.

Let's do it!

30.

EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

As the guys walk across the front of the lodge, they pass

some well preserved CARS all parked together: a 1985 Pontiac

Fiero, a 1986 VW Golf, and a 1987 Ford Mustang coupe.

What is this, a shitty car club?

The guys COMPLETELY MISS the BILLBOARDS ACROSS THE STREET:

-- "Coming soon: the most spaced-out Mel Brooks film yet!

SPACEBALLS!"

-- A surfing MAX HEADROOM with a CAN OF COKE and the tag:

"Catch the Wave!"

-- A bull terrier named SPUDS MCKENZIE parking with some HOT

BABES and a shitload of BUD LIGHT.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

In QUICK CUTS, the guys hit the slopes:

-- In his ridiculous snowsuit, Nick skis down the mountain.

With the new snowfall, he expertly glides along.

-- Jacob applies some LIP BALM and flies down the mountain on

a SNOWBOARD. People glare at him with confused expressions.

-- Adam uses the snowplow method to slowly descend. He's a

beginner skier. He takes the time to look at the

surroundings and notices a YOUNGER, HOTTER CROWD skiing

today. Lots of BLONDE SKI BUNNIES wearing PASTEL colors.

Well this place has improved.

-- In the lift line, Lou passes a GUY wearing a BIG HEADBAND.

Really, asshole?

INT. GONDOLA - DAY

Adam shares a gondola with Nick, as they make their way up

the mountain. A DUDE IN SUNGLASSES sits across, napping.

Adam takes a FLASK out of his backpack. He and Nick look

over their shoulders like scheming kids as they take a nip.

31.

I'm really glad we stayed. It's

gonna be good to get away for a

couple of days.

I mean not like I want to be away

from Lily. You know.

Believe me I know.

I love her. But you guys are

right. I'm gonna be with her for

the rest of my life.

For the rest of your goddamn life.

It gets easier, right? No offense,

but watching you talk with Courtney-

You're gonna be fine. You'll

settle in, get the premium cable

package - the usual deal.

Adam nods.

You'll wake up every morning,

comforted by the fact that your

wife doesn't wield her family's

wealth over your head like a

hangman's noose.

Adam looks concerned, as Nick wistfully goes on...

You'll breathe the air of life,

making the occasional decision -

maybe get some lawn furniture. How

about steak for dinner? Yes, let's

get that juice machine I saw on TV.

Let's fucking go for it.

Nick stares off into the distance.

Nick?

32.

Sorry, I lost myself there.

DUDE IN SUNGLASSES (O.S.)

Coke?

Adam and Nick look at the guy across from them, who presently

offers his SKI GOGGLES, on which is a mountain of COCAINE.

That is a lot of cocaine.

I feel like we're in Scarface.

Only with skiing.

Skiface.

DUDE IN SUNGLASSES

Take it. It's good shit.

I'm gonna pass.

Yeah, I'm good.

The dude removes his sunglasses. He has a dead look in his

eyes, studying Nick and Adam.

DUDE IN SUNGLASSES

You guys a couple of spazzes?

Spazzes?

DUDE IN SUNGLASSES

Yeah, dipstick. You narcs? You

Miami Vice? Which one's Crockett?

Which one's CROCKETT?!

I'm Crockett, obviously!

That's the Don Johnson one, right?

The dude flips out a SWITCHBLADE.

DUDE IN SUNGLASSES

You show me you're not spazzes.

33.

We're not spazzes.

The dude extends the coke once more.

DUDE IN SUNGLASSES

Show me.

EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - MOMENTS LATER

At the top of the mountain, Nick looks WIDE AWAKE. Adam, on

the other hand, looks COKED OUT OF HIS SKULL. He sniffs,

fidgets, clenches his jaw, and looks generally "up."

Adam, you gotta chill. You just

did one line.

I've never ridden the horse before.

You're not riding the horse. The

horse is heroin.

Adam can't stop moving and fidgeting.

I don't know what kind of animal

I'm riding, but it's the best

animal of all time. I feel great!

Adam uses his SKI POLES to push off the top of the mountain

and he goes FLYING DOWN THE SLOPE.

Adam! Jesus.

EXT. MOUNTAIN / SKI TRAIL - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Adam TUCKS down, still CLENCHING HIS TEETH. He PICKS UP

SPEED as he flies down the mountain like a racer.

FURTHER UP THE MOUNTAIN

Nick has to pull up and slow down in the name of safety.

34.

He zips along, never changing course or slowing. He BARELY

MISSES a few TREES. But he can't stop himself before --

HE BARRELS INTO A SMOKING HOT CHICK!

The collision knocks Adam and the girl to the ground and

finally stops Adam's hyper-speed descent.

Adam gets up and shakes the cobwebs.

What a rush!

He notices the girl on the ground and goes to help her up.

Oh wow, are you OK?

SMOKING HOT CHICK

No thanks to you, asshole!

IN SLOW MOTION --

The girl stands up in a very hot and awesome manner, SHAKING

THE SNOW from her luxurious blonde hair. It twinkles in the

sunlight. As she turns to face Adam,

NORMAL SPEED RESUMES. And he sees who it is:

Jennie O'Keefe!

Jennie squints at Adam, trying to place him.

Do I know you?

He stares at her, not believing what he's seeing. He still

looks loopy from the coke.

Just then, a a too-blond, mirror-sunglass-wearing, feathered

hair, striped-jumpsuited guy (BLAINE) SKIS UP and GRABS ADAM.

I'm gonna serve you a knuckle

sandwich, airhead.

You all right, babe?

I think so.

35.

Blaine's TOADIES (TAD and CHAZ) ski up behind him, as Blaine

ANGRILY RIPS Adam's lift ticket from his jacket.

Your lift ticket's been revoked.

Blaine throws it on the ground and laughs to his friends.

(a la Lethal Weapon 2)

Diplomatic immunity.

Blaine looks confused, as Adam RIPS Blaine's lift ticket, but

he ends up RIPPING BLAINE'S JACKET too.

Sorry, I was trying to... you can

probably patch that up.

Blaine PULLS Adam close by the collar and clenches his fist.

You're dead meat, scumbag.

Just then, SNOW POWDER flies in Blaine's face. Blaine lets

go of Adam, as Jacob snowboards up and stops short, coming to

his brother's side.

There you are! My brother's had a

few too many triple Venti nonfat

lattes if you know what I mean.

(genuine, to Adam)

Are you OK?

Adam nods. Blaine looks confused. CHAZ and TAD look

enamored with Jacob.

Dude, they let you bring a

skateboard on the mountain?

It's a snowboard. You know - no

wheels.

Genius! Man, not to get all fag on

you, but I'm digging your fresh

threads, bro.

Adam and Blaine look equally confused with what's going on.

Jacob takes the compliment well, like he deserves it.

36.

Thank you. It's mostly North Face.

A little EMS.

Whatever it is, it works.

Totally. What are you doing with

this boner? You should be skiing

with us. Like permanently.

Blaine looks really annoyed with his friends.

Guys!

I mean, that's if Blaine thinks

it's cool and everything.

Blaine takes a deep breath, annoyed.

Get your spaz brother out of here.

And for his sake, I don't wanna see

him back on my mountain.

You're welcome any time though!

Adam picks up his BACKPACK, which fell off during the

collision. He stares at Jennie again and smiles.

You look JUST like this girl. I

had the biggest crush on her--

Blaine grabs the bag out of Adam's hand and SHOVES ADAM away.

This is mine now.

Adam looks at Blaine angrily, but Jacob holds him back.

Come on. Let's just go.

Jacob ushers Adam off the slope, as Blaine shoulders the bag.

37.

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - DAY

Adam and Jacob walk in the front door. Gone are the children

and old people. The living room off the lobby presently

hosts what appears to be an amazing 80s RETRO PARTY. A radio

plays Miami Sound Machine's "Conga."

Girls and guys wear printed sweaters, feathered dos, and neon

leggings. It's something out of a mid-80s Aspen photo shoot.

Nick walks in behind them, looking as confused as them. He

turns up his palms and shakes his head, at a loss for words.

What is going on?

Lou strolls up to the guys, with his arms around TWO HOT

CHICKS. He looks elated.

Guys! I'm so glad you're here. I

want to introduce you to Michelle

and Sandy. These lovely ladies are

having a roller skating party next

weekend and no offense, but fuck

your wedding -- I'm totally coming

back. By the way...

Lou rolls out a ZIPLOCK BAG full of cocaine.

There's coke everywhere around

here. This place rules!

Lou dips into the coke and rubs it on his gums and we:

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE AFTERNOON

The suite looks a little "fresher." The furniture is the

same, but everything's in better shape. It looks almost new.

Adam, Jacob, and Lou sit in the main room with the TV on, as

Nick emerges from a bedroom.

Has anyone else noticed that things

around here are weird as shit?

Adam and Nick nod. Lou shakes his head.

38.

Don't you ruin this. If you wake

me from this dream, I'll kill you.

What do you think happened?

I have no idea, but look...

Jacob turns up the VOLUME on the TV. The NEWS airs.

NEWSCASTER (ON TV)

The Dow Jones Industrial Average

closed just above 2,000 today...

I'm ruined!

NEWSCASTER (ON TV)

In other news, the Tower Commission

has rebuked President Reagan for

not controlling his national

security staff in an arms-for-

hostages deal with Iran...

For a moment, the guys sit there in stunned silence. Then...

(with genuine emotion)

We're in 1971.

We're in 1987.

Everyone looks stunned and dazed.

What are we gonna do? I have plans

next weekend.

We all have plans. It's my fucking

wedding!

Now hold on, we don't know for sure

that we're in 1987.

The TV shows a (real) COMMERCIAL for the COMMODORE 64

computer, with a JINGLE that SINGS: "Are you keeping up with

the Commodore, 'cause the Commodore's keeping up with you..."

39.

When it's over...

OK, we're in 1987.

Adam stands up, completely losing it.

What the FUCK is going on?!

Nick stands up and calmly takes charge.

Everyone relax. I think I know

what's happened. And when we're

done discussing it, we're all gonna

feel a lot better.

Everyone looks to Nick, who seems to have the answer.

Two words: black hole.

He lets it hang in the air for a moment, as if it's suddenly

going to gel for everyone. But the guys look confused.

I saw a special on the Science

Channel. And guess what?

Sometimes this happens.

This happens?

Yes. And the best thing for us to

do is to stay put. The universe

will eventually reverse itself and

work out this little glitch.

Nick sits down, looking satisfied in his know-it-all-ness.

This is a big glitch.

Yeah, you're an idiot. Black holes

are in space. Not at a ski resort.

So does this mean we get to go to

girls' locker rooms and see them

naked and they can't see us?

40.

No, we traveled through time.

We're not invisible.

Lou looks upset.

(under his breath)

I'm still gonna do it.

Guys, ignoring the ridiculousness

of how we got here for a moment--

Black hole.

How are we supposed to get back?

For a moment, everyone sits and absorbs the question. Then:

We find a scientist.

INT. IBM / RECEPTION - LATE AFTERNOON

Our guys WAIT NERVOUSLY near a RECEPTION DESK, above which is

the "IBM" logo. Lou reads a MAGAZINE.

This Dukakis guy seems like he

might be the real deal.

An affable MAN IN A SUIT approaches.

MAN IN SUIT

Gentlemen, how may I help you?

We're waiting for a scientist.

MAN IN SUIT

I am a scientist.

Where's your white coat?

I'm not that kind of scientist.

41.

Lou stands up and throws down his magazine.

This is bullshit! I told you--

Wait a minute. Just tell him.

OK. You tell him, Adam.

Sir, we...

This is ridiculous.

Nothing's too ridiculous in the

name of science.

We're from the future.

Get the fuck out of here.

EXT. IBM OFFICE PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

A SECURITY GUARD escorts our guys out of the building.

That went well.

Lou starts walking off by himself.

Where are you going?

Lou points to his watch.

Five o'clock. Happy hour.

The guys look at him, confused.

If it's '87, the PF Chang's will be

gone, which means the Brew Haus

still stands.

It's Saturday. They have wet T-

shirt contests on Saturdays.

42.

The guys' eyebrows raise. After a moment:

Well, maybe one drink. Just to

confirm.

INT. BREW HAUS - HAPPY HOUR

SPLASH! A WET T-SHIRT CONTEST is underway on a STAGE.

Whitesnake on the juke, PAC MAN on the tables, and cheap

beers in the mugs - this is an amazing brew pub.

Our guys sit in the back, wearing PINE VALLEY LODGE shirts.

There are MANY EMPTIES on the table and they look VERY DRUNK.

In a roped-off area in the corner, a cocky YOUNGER PHIL (the

one-armed bellhop) wields a CHAINSAW that he uses to carve an

ICE SCULPTURE, impressing the bar crowd. He has BOTH ARMS.

Holy shit. It's that bellhop.

Should we warn him?

I don't want to see this go down.

Phil TOSSES THE CHAINSAW IN THE AIR and...

He expertly CATCHES IT, seamlessly continuing to carve. A

GIRL leans in and gives him a kiss.

Fuck that guy.

ON THE STAGE, TWO GIRLS compete for wettest t-shirt. They

both decide that NO T-SHIRT is the wettest option.

God bless our country.

(in a daze)

We're in 1987.

You can stop saying that. I don't

think it's making a difference.

43.

Seriously, we have to get back.

(kinda losing it)

We seriously have to get back!

The guys subdue Adam, as a BIG-HAIRED WAITRESS brings drinks.

Here ya go, guys. Three Buds, one

Bartles and James.

The guys all stare at her like she's a museum artifact.

What? I have lipstick on my teeth?

Nick sips his WINE COOLER, feeling the eyes of the others on

him.

Hey, if it's available, I'm

ordering it. I always wanted one

of these when I was little.

The waitress puts down the CHECK. Jacob picks it up,

realizing something.

(to the waitress)

Can you give us a second?

She walks away, as Jacob turns to the guys.

This is gonna be a problem.

He takes out his wallet, showing his CREDIT CARDS and CASH.

Guys, we're in trouble. Our cards

aren't gonna work and our new money

looks fake.

The guys look concerned, but then Nick notices something:

A TABLE FULL OF JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN.

I've got an idea.

As Nick gets up and approaches the businessmen, Adam looks

around the room and by the bar, he spots --

44.

Jennie.

He stares at her from across the room. Lou and Jacob notice.

I still can't believe it's really

her!

She's aged remarkably well.

Oh, right. Why don't you just go

talk to her?

I should go talk to her. To

apologize, of course. You know,

nothing inappropriate.

Sure...

Adam GETS UP. He slowly makes his way over across the room.

Jennie is talking to TWO OTHER GIRLS as Adam approaches. He

lurks near them like a creep. Jennie eventually notices him,

as he keeps stealing glances. She doesn't look happy.

Listen putz, if you're gonna try to

attack me again, my boyfriend will

be here soon. He'll kick your ass.

Adam tries to be casual.

No, no. No ass kicking. I just

wanted to say I'm sorry about

earlier. I lost control of the old

skis there.

Looks like I shoulda taken another

one of your classes!

When did you take my class?

Certainly not when I was a kid! I

mean, that would make no sense!

Adam tries to recover.

45.

I was here for a convention. Power

tools. And regular tools. All

sorts of tools. I'm big into

tools. It was a couple years ago.

Jennie looks very suspect of Adam.

Yeah, OK. Have a good night.

Jennie starts to walk away with her friends.

Hey, where ya going?

She ignores him, but one of her friends quietly lags behind.

(quietly, to Adam)

Are you with that guy over there?

She discretely points out Jacob.

Yeah, he's my brother.

She takes Adam's PALM and writes something on it.

There's a party later tonight at

this address. Make sure he comes

with you. He's way boss!

Adam walks back to his friends.

How'd it go?

He shows them his palm.

We got invited to a party later.

sweet! What are we gonna do until

then?

How about figure out how the hell

to get back to the present day?

Nick walks back to the table and SLAMS down a pile of CASH.

46.

Bam!

We're millionaires!

Close. It's a thousand bucks.

Where did you get that money?

Nick points out the Japanese Businessmen.

Sold them my iPod.

Jacob looks incredulous.

That was NOT a good idea!

I agree. You left so much money on

the table. It's a fucking iPod!

You could've gotten a LOT more!

That's not what I--

(looking at watch)

Fellas, we are not making progress

and we're losing time.

Adam, don't worry. Time's not

moving forward in the future.

Uh, yeah it is. Lest we forget the

lessons learned from Bill and Ted.

Well then I give you Back to the

Future.

That's not fair. You can't go

right to Back to the Future.

Why not?

47.

Back to the Future had a time

machine.

Well so did Bill and Ted.

Wait, that's it! I can't believe

I'm about to say this, but I think

we have a time machine.

Adam, all we did is get drunk in

the hot tub.

Everyone's EYES GO WIDE.

(puts it together)

A hot tub time machine.

EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - EARLY EVENING

All four guys soak in the tub. They TOAST with drinks.

Here goes nothing!

They simultaneously DOWN their drinks. Nothing happens.

Like the chimps in 2001, each of them begins FIDDLING WITH

KNOBS and PUSHING ON LIGHTS, trying to find the magic button.

After a few moments:

Well, it was worth a shot.

ANGLE WIDENS to reveal other PEOPLE in the tub. A GUY AND

GIRL make out, two STONERS pass a joint, and one TOPLESS

CHICK just chills out.

(stares at girl)

I love this place.

As Lou pours himself another, Adam starts to lose it again.

Guys, we're running out of ideas

here!

48.

I mean we tried the scientist, the

tub -- what the fuck do we do next?

Lou DOWNS ANOTHER SHOT and gets a crazy look in his eye.

I know what we do next.

EXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING

A DELOREAN is parked in the empty lot. Adam, Nick, and Jacob

look at it, drunkenly and bleary-eyed. Adam and Nick trade

swigs from a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY.

The gull wing door opens and Lou steps out, in a foul mood.

Rental car agency fucked us!

There's no flux capacitor.

Lou pulls Jacob over and straps him in the driver's seat,

before walking around to the passenger side.

(to Adam and Nick)

We'll travel to 2010. Then one of

us will come back and get one of

you. And so on and so forth.

INT. DELOREAN - EARLY EVENING

Lou sits in the passenger seat next to Jacob.

Go light on the clutch. I don't

wanna lose our deposit.

Jacob starts the car.

EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

Adam and Nick watch the car pull out of the parking lot.

This will not end well.

49.

INT./EXT. DELOREAN - SAME TIME

Jacob and Lou hit the road, picking up speed. They pass a

COP, who pulls out, turning on his LIGHTS AND SIREN.

Oh shit, they found me! I don't

know how but they found me!

I always wanted to say that. Punch

it!

Jacob HITS THE GAS.

Let's see the look on this pig's

face when we hit 88 and disappear

into thin air! Yeah!

The SPEEDOMETER hits 75, 80, 85, and then 90. And then 95.

The car SHAKES VIOLENTLY.

This thing's a piece of shit.

Up ahead, the ROAD CURVES DRASTICALLY.

Hey Lou?

Yeah?

We're doing a hundred. I can't

control this car.

I hear ya.

EXT. ROAD - EARLY EVENING

The Delorean BRAKES, but doesn't make the turn. It FLIPS

OVER in a fantastic disaster and comes to a stop in a DITCH.

The COP pulls over, gets out of his car, and DRAWS HIS GUN.

50.

EXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING

Adam and Nick watch the accident from a distance.

So do you think we should run away?

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Looking ragged as hell, the four guys walk into the room and

silently collapse on various BEDS and COUCHES.

I wonder if we'll still be here for

our court appearance.

If we're still here in four months,

I will happily go to jail, because

I'll be fucked anyway.

A GUY walks out of the bathroom, wearing only a TOWEL. He

looks startled.

Who the hell are you dweebs?!

Lou is up IN A FLASH. He IMMEDIATELY DECKS THE GUY OUT COLD

and PUMMELS HIM on the floor! The others pull him off.

Jesus Christ, what the hell, Lou?!

I have no tolerance for intruders.

This is probably his room! We're

not registered here in 87.

Lou thinks for a moment and looks a "little" sorry.

I'm still pretty OK with it.

You have a problem.

Just help me put him outside.

51.

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The guys open the door to the suite and find TWO DUDES

walking by. Adam stops them.

Hey. Dudes. Our friend's...

hellaciously wasted. He partied

pretty hearty... to the max. To

the extreme max.

Bodacious.

So you guys wanna fuck with him or

what?

Excellent.

The dudes take custody of the passed out TOWEL GUY and

continue on down the hall, as our guys go back inside.

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - NIGHT

The guys look physically exhausted.

Let's just go to sleep. We'll

figure everything out in the

morning. It's pretty late.

Jacob checks his watch, rolling his eyes.

It's 8:45.

The other guys look at their watches, surprised.

Why am I so wiped out?

Because you're old and lame?

Yeah, fuck that, we're going to

that party!

We are not going to the party.

52.

Hear me out.

Lou paces around the room like Patton addressing the troops.

We saw the scientist. He was

worthless. We tried the tub. Dead

end. I got us a fucking time

machine. From Hertz. It might as

well have been a Nissan.

Adam shakes his head, as Lou continues.

Gentlemen, it's fucking 1987.

Nixon's in the White House, gas is

free, and we're about to put a man

on the moon!

Did we go to the same school?

Lou turns and addresses Adam directly.

The point is you haven't even met

your wife yet! She can't fault you

ago! Even if 23 years ago somehow

ends up being tonight!

Adam starts listening a little more closely, as some of Lou's

logic actually makes "some" sense.

It's time to start facing the fact

that we may not be going home. And

if that's so, then we owe it to

ourselves to make the best life we

can for ourselves.

The guys listen intently, as Lou's speech reaches a

passionate climax.

Because I don't want to be that

college freshman who spends the

first semester hiding in his dorm

room, only to realize that come

spring, he has no friends.

No!

53.

LOU (CONT' D )

I want to be that college freshman

who fucks chicks way out of his

league before they have an

opportunity to realize he's not as

cool as he's pretending to be!

Nick nods. Even Jacob smiles.

Are you with me?

I don't know.

Close enough. We'll talk some more

at the party.

INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

It's like the 80s exploded. Music, clothes, hair, attitude --

it's all on overdrive. In one section, PARTY-GOERS marvel at

DUCK HUNT, while in another area, people make out and dance.

Adam, Nick, Lou, and Jacob walk in the front door. They have

updated their "looks" with 80s sweaters and other era-

appropriate attire. They all look ridiculous, except for

Jacob, whose youth lends him hipster appeal.

This sweater makes me look like a

jerkof f .

It's good to be home.

In a corner, Phil puts his ARM in a SHARK TANK. Just as the

shark goes to bite, he PULLS HIS ARM OUT, unscathed. A small

crowd claps. Our guys are confused and upset.

Was this like an 80s thing?

If he doesn't lose that arm soon,

I'm gonna take it from him myself.

With that, Lou wanders off toward another room, leering at

and groping girls as he goes.

54.

He's gonna be a problem.

Tad and Chaz walk over, looking dapper and douchey. They are

excited to see Jacob.

Hey, glad you could make it!

This is your party?

Hey man, no hard feelings, all

right? If your bro says you're

cool, then we're cool.

Tad puts his arm around Jacob and leads him into the party.

There's some people I want you to

meet. By the way, bodacious hair.

Incredibly chic.

Oh yeah? It doesn't really take

that much product. It's all in the

layering.

Whoa. Product. You're blowing my

mind right now. Did you spend time

in Europe?

Don't tell me. Prague. Do you

want some coke?

Do you have Coke Zero?

Ah, a conscientious objector. I

like that. Gotta stay sharp.

IN THE KITCHEN

Nick mixes something in a large bowl, as plenty of EAGER

PARTY-GOERS look on. He pours a red liquid into a tray of

CUPS. An attractive PARTY CHICK follows his every move.

55.

These will be ready in 15 minutes.

(putting it together)

So it's like jello. With vodka.

Mmm hmm. You get drunk while you

enjoy a delicious gelatin snack.

How come no one ever thought of

this before?

Don't know. I just invented it.

Party chick looks into his eyes, dreamily.

I appreciate you.

(way too heartfelt)

I love you.

IN THE LIVING ROOM

Lou PLAYS AN ELECTRIC KEYBOARD for about 15-20 people. He's

performing Ace of Base's "The Sign" and SINGING PASSIONATELY.

Adam walks up to where Jacob aims a large VIDEO CAMERA.

He did a bunch of drugs and went on

a rant about how much he resents

Ace of Base.

That band's from the 90s.

I know. He made me borrow Tad's

video camera. He wants to document

the performance and sue the band

for infringement when we get back.

Adam sees Tad and Chaz behaving like cocks across the room,

making hot girls drink too much.

56.

(re: Tad and Chaz)

So, you like these guys?

They're rich, popular, and they

shower me with compliments.

They're pretty much the best

friends I've ever had.

ON A BALCONY

A CROWD gathers around Phil, who has removed the cover of a

SPINNING INDUSTRIAL FAN.

Phil! Phil! Phil!

Like a zen master, Phil reaches out and GRABS A FAN BLADE,

stopping the fan WITHOUT INJURY. Everyone celebrates!

IN THE KITCHEN

Nick holds up a HOMEMADE BEER BONG, from which he drinks. He

has his own CROWD rooting him on.

Nick! Nick! Nick!

He finishes the last of the beer, and the crowd celebrates.

This guy should be in charge of

everything!

I should.

IN THE LIVING ROOM

Lou SITS ON A COUCH with Michelle, one of the girls we met

earlier at the lodge. Her friend Sandy sits across from them

next to Jacob, who looks uncomfortable.

Truth or dare?

Lou confers with Michelle before answering.

Dare.

57.

Sandy and Jacob confer, figuring out the dare. Lou meets

Jacob's eyes -- he smiles, knowing Jacob has his back.

OK, we dare Lou to put a Twizzler

up his ass.

Lou stands up and angrily points at Jacob.

You son of a bitch! Have you ever

played this game before? It's

supposed to be awesome!

Lou nevertheless grabs a TWIZZLER from the snack bowl and

shoves it down the back of his pants. His face contorts

uncomfortably and he is almost on the verge of tears.

This is a horrible thing you're

doing and I hope you never have to

experience what I am currently

going through.

Lou sits down and Michelle consoles him.

Your turn! Truth or dare?

Before Sandy can even confer with Jacob:

Truth.

Lou throws up his hands in frustration. He looks miserable,

as Michelle confers with him.

(grumbling to Michelle)

I don't care. Whatever. This is

not the point of the game.

OK, each of you has to tell your

darkest, most personal secret.

Lou crosses his arms and shakes his head.

58.

Oh wow, all right. Let me think.

I've never told anyone this, but I

was afraid of scary movies until I

was 18. I even ran out of the

theater a couple of times.

Oh you poor thing! Come here...

She takes Jacob's head to her chest and strokes it gently.

Lou makes a jerk-off gesture.

I'm not sure I should tell mine.

Come on! You have to!

OK, but you can't laugh.

We promise. Let's hear it.

So this one time me and my friend

Lori took a train to Baltimore. It

was the summer and we wanted to

party, but we had no money. So

Lori found this businessman who was

also looking for a good time and

told him that we'd give him a half

and half for seventy-five dollars.

You know -- a suck and fuck.

Lou and Jacob look shocked with the MATTER OF FACT

storytelling. Michelle smiles. She's heard it before.

Anyway, we get him up to his room

and Lori starts going down on him,

but I really wasn't into it. So I

broke a piece of the bathroom

mirror and used it to cut his

artery on the-heck. Right here...

She rubs Jacob's neck, pointing it out.

He bled for about an hour before he

died.

59.

Afterwards, we took his wallet to

the bar and found out he only had

forty-seven dollars.

Michelle GIGGLES.

Michelle! You said you wouldn't

laugh!

I'm sorry!

Jacob and Lou look shell-shocked.

IN ANOTHER ROOM

Adam sits in a chair in the corner, secluded. To his LEFT --

Nick's in the kitchen, catching POPCORN in his mouth and

earning accolades from all his new fans.

To Adam's RIGHT --

The truth or dare game devolves, as Michelle PIERCES LOU'S

EAR. He screams in pain, but at the end, he has a GOLD STUD

in his RIGHT EAR. Lou points at Jacob.

Fuck you, your turn.

That's the gay ear, you know.

As Adam looks STRAIGHT AHEAD --

He sees Jennie all by herself, browsing the hosts' CASSETTE

TAPE COLLECTION. Adam takes a moment to check himself. Then

he reaches for his DRINK and GULPS THE WHOLE THING, before

getting up and WALKING OVER to her, catching her off guard.

So I lied to you earlier. I wasn't

here for a power tool convention.

Jennie instinctively looks around for her friends.

I know. You don't look like you

could handle power tools.

60.

The truth is, Jennie, I've always

liked you. But I've never really

known you. I really wasn't

supposed to meet you again.

Who are you?!

Adam shrugs, indicating he might as well tell her.

I came here from the future.

She rolls her eyes - she's heard all the one-liners.

Let me guess. You want to beam me

up to your spaceship built for two?

Or maybe you're wondering if these

are astronaut pants?

Astronaut pants?

Because my ass is out of this

world? Give me a break, spaz.

I've heard them all.

She turns away. Adam goes after her.

No! No spaceship. No astronaut

pants. Just regular time travel.

With normal pants.

OK, what's the punch line?

An ARM comes from behind and CHOKES ADAM. It's Blaine.

I thought I told you to stay off my

mountain, partner!

Blaine, stop!

You talking to my girl? Huh? I

can't hear you.

Adam fights to breathe, as Blaine chokes him harder.

61.

Blaine, that's enough! Let him go!

He can't breathe!

Blaine doesn't stop. He smiles like an asshole.

Can't breathe? Is that right? Can

you breathe, partner? What's that?

I can't hear you. Just tell me you

can't breathe and I'll stop.

Adam still struggles. Blaine just shrugs.

He's not saying anything. I guess

he can breathe.

Jennie pulls on Blaine's arm, trying to free Adam.

Babe, stop. Jennie, stop!

Blaine turns and accidentally ELBOWS JENNIE in the face. She

goes down. He releases Adam and turns to help her.

Baby, I'm sorry.

(turns to Adam)

See what you made me do?!

Screw you, Blaine!

Jennie gets up. She grabs Adam's arm and YANKS HIM along

with her, as she storms away.

Come on, let's go!

Blaine looks ON FIRE, as he watches Jennie leave with Adam.

LOU (V.0.)

Sandy, I don't know what you did

with this wine, but it is

delightful.

INT. APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

Jacob and Lou sit with Michelle and Sandy back at the girls'

apartment. The whole place looks like a Madonna concert.

62.

Jacob looks uncomfortable, but Lou pours on the polite charm.

It's from a box. There's lots!

Mmm. Fantastic.

Do you mind if I borrow my friend?

We'll only be a moment.

INT. APARTMENT / BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Lou has Jacob PINNED AGAINST THE WALL with his arm. He

speaks quietly, but with purpose.

You're gonna fuck her!

I'm not gonna have sex with her.

She killed a guy!

That guy was undesirable. You

heard her. It was about the money.

Great, so she's a prostitute. I'm

not sleeping with a hooker either.

She's not a hooker. She's a girl

who did what she had to do to make

a few bucks.

(tries new tactic)

Listen, she's probably awesome in

bed.

She probably has a hairy vagina.

Exactly!

Jacob looks confused.

I'm not having this conversation.

It's pointless. I don't have a

condom.

63.

Perfect! Me neither! No one here

uses condoms. It's like heaven.

Only with a lot more coke.

Lou takes his COKE out of his pocket and SNORTS a bunch.

How do I look?

Like a fucking madman?

He slaps Jacob's arms.

Rock and roll.

Lou exits the bathroom and calls out to the girls.

Who's ready to get laid by an

awesome penis?!

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - LATE NIGHT

Adam and Jennie are sitting on the floor by the fireplace,

playing MONOPOLY.

Oooh, Atlantic Avenue. That's

gonna cost you.

How much?

I'll tell ya what...

Adam moves her token up a few squares and makes a show of

looking over his shoulder, as if someone might see.

I'm not supposed to do this. But

I'm gonna upgrade you to Marvin

Gardens. It's a suite. Plus,

there's an excellent buffet and a

view of the pool.

Jennie laughs, despite herself. She looks around, as if

someone might see her. Adam notices.

64.

No one's gonna see you hanging out

with the creepy spaz. Don't worry.

I'm sorry I called you those names.

Hey, it's cool. I was being creepy

and spazzy.

You're still not gonna tell me how

you know me?

I'm from the future.

Fine, let's just drop it. I'm glad

you're feeling better. Blaine had

no right to hit you.

I bet he's going out of his mind

right now.

What are you doing with a douche

like him anyway? You're so much

better than that.

Yeah, well guys like you come to

visit. Guys like him live here.

So if I lived here, I'd have a

shot?

For a moment, Jennie is thrown off. She's about to say

something, but checks herself. Instead she nervously stands.

I'm gonna get going.

Adam stands up with her.

Thanks for being a good guy. I

don't remember the last time I had

this much fun playing such a stupid

game.

She gives Adam a sweet KISS ON THE CHEEK.

65.

If you run into Blaine, you can

tell him I blew you. But that's

all. We didn't do anything else.

We didn't do anything!

Shh. It's our little secret.

Jennie exits, leaving Adam confused.

INT. APARTMENT / BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

In the darkness, we hear SOUNDS OF SEX. Moans of pleasure,

creaks of mattresses, multiple "yesses."

On TWIN BEDS that are a little too close to each other, Lou

and Jacob have sex with Michelle and Sandy. The girls and

Lou are vocal. Jacob is silent.

As Sandy rides him, Jacob notices some BROKEN GLASS on the

bedside table. He can't take his eyes off it, as Sandy's

hand keeps brushing up against the table.

Lou, naked, DRINKS A CAN OF TAB while he delivers the goods

to Michelle. He reaches over, mid-act, and hands the half-

empty can to Jacob.

Tab?

Stop talking to me!

Despite the fact that this looks like very good sex -- it is

very bad sex for Jacob.

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE NIGHT

Adam is asleep in bed, as Jennie quietly enters the room. He

wakes up to find her wearing SEXY LINGERIE, as she CLIMBS ON

TOP of him.

Jennie!

66.

He looks over and sees Nick SNORING in the other bed.

What are you doing here?!

Jennie gives Adam a LONG WET KISS. He's freaked out.

I thought about what you said and

you're right. I should be with

you.

I didn't necessarily say that.

I want you, Adam!

She RIPS OPEN her lingerie, revealing her AWESOME HEAVING

NAKED BREASTS.

Oh my god!

She kisses him again and they start to go at it. Just then --

LILY (O.S.)

What the hell is going on here?

Adam pushes Jennie off him, as the LIGHTS GO ON in the room.

Lily is standing in the doorway, looking sad and angry.

Lily?

So you do like her better than me?

No, she just--

Adam looks to where Jennie just was, but now the bed is

covered with PHOTOS OF JENNIE. There's also a LARGE BOX OF

TISSUES and some HAND LOTION.

What's all this?

Jennie?

What's wrong with my vagina, Adam?

67.

Nothing's wrong with it. It's

beautiful.

In the next bed, Nick rolls over and wakes up.

It's a beautiful vagina. Among the

prettiest I've ever seen.

Stay out of it, Nick!

Would it be so bad to spend the

rest of your life with my vagina?

No. It wouldn't at all.

Lily turns and walks out the door.

Lily, it wouldn't! I love your

vagina! I love your vaginaaaaaa!

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - MORNING

Adam abruptly WAKES UP.

Vagina... huh?

He sees Nick sitting on a bed on the other side of the room.

He's ON THE PHONE, talking quietly with someone.

NICK (ON PHONE)

I just really need to get a few

things off my chest. You're

domineering and you think you have

all the answers, but you don't.

Not by a long shot.

Nick is getting emotional.

NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)

You think you're better than me?

Last night I made jello shots and

everybody loved me.

68.

NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)

They didn't care that I only

brought home 60k last year. They

loved me for me. They didn't go

throwing their rich parents' weight

around.

(wipes away a tear)

I don't know, Courtney.

INT. CHILD'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

A 6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (Nick's future wife) listens to this

crying man on the other end of the phone.

6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE)

It's OK.

Nick CRIES a little bit harder.

NICK (ON PHONE)

It's so good to hear your voice. I

love you, princess. I really do.

You just make it so hard on me

sometimes.

6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE)

It's OK.

NICK (ON PHONE)

You're right. It's OK. I just

want it to be OK.

Adam starts registering some of this conversation.

Who are you talking to?

Nick looks at Adam and covers the receiver.

Courtney.

What do you mean "Courtney?"

Adam picks up ANOTHER PHONE.

ADAM (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)

Hello?

6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE)

Hello!

69.

Adam, freaked out, HANGS UP his phone.

Get off the phone!!

But Nick is down the rabbit hole.

NICK (ON PHONE)

Baby, I gotta go. Just think about

what I said. We're so great

together. It's like when we're

having sex - the way our bodies

become one, as we both embrace the

passion of the moment--

On the other end, COURTNEY'S DAD has picked up the phone.

COURTNEY'S DAD (ON PHONE)

WHO THE FUCK IS THIS?!

Nick hangs up the phone and stares at it, freaked out. Adam

just shakes his head.

OK, so that may have been bad.

What were you thinking?

The DOOR OPENS and Lou strolls in, looking quite fresh.

Guess who re-popped his 80s cherry?

This guy!

He points at himself in a celebratory manner, as behind him --

The Towel Guy whose room this is comes RUNNING UP.

Hey, get the hell out of my room!

In one move, Lou catches him inside the room, closes the door

with his foot, and puts the guy in a HEAD LOCK. He then

converts it into a SLEEPER HOLD, putting the guy to sleep.

Oh, we're going to jail.

Help me put him in the closet.

70.

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

The guys drop the sleeping Towel Guy in the closet.

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO -- MOMENTS LATER

Adam, Nick, and Lou take a soak in the tub.

Has anyone seen Jacob?

He's grabbing drinks with Tad and

Chaz. Which is what we should do.

We'll start at the Brew Haus and do

a three drink crawl up the street--

Adam gets more fed up than ever.

Guys! I refuse to accept that

we're stuck in 1987! Maybe you're

loving it, Lou. But you don't get

it. Nick's insane, Jacob's become

a bigger douche than before, and I

need to get back for my goddamn

rehearsal dinner? Which is

tomorrow!

Adam. I know I don't look like I

understand, but I do. You have a

beautiful fiancee who means more to

you than anything in the world.

And if you could, you'd literally

travel across time for her.

Yes.

I get it, man. Life is about these

moments. Moments where a regular

Joe becomes a hero. Moments where

you dig deep and find the

motivation... the courage... the

guts to do what's right and what's

necessary. It's moments like

these...

Lou suddenly notices some COCAINE on the edge of the tub.

71.

Jesus, how come nobody told me

there was coke out here?

Lou SNORTS A BIG LINE.

What was I saying?

Adam and Nick get out and towel off. Lou follows.

Maybe we have to learn something?

What do you mean?

You know, like Groundhog Day. We

have to learn the meaning of life

or some shit.

Just then, a KITTEN licking a PUDDLE on the base of the tub

JUMPS in the hot tub and VANISHES IN A BRIGHT LIGHT!

For a moment, everyone is quiet.

I've gotta stop doing cocaine and I

need to go to the hospital. I just

saw a fucking kitten explode.

I saw it too.

The guys run over to the tub. The bubbles are on low, but

there's NOTHING IN IT.

It didn't explode. It vanished.

It went back... to the present.

This is the present.

Our old present.

So it is the tub!

Lou POINTS at something.

72.

Um...

The HOT TUB IS NOT PLUGGED IN, and yet it's clearly running.

OK. You guys know what to do.

EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - MINUTES LATER

The guys have a COUPLE BOXES OF KITTENS. One at a time, they

get in the tub and take turns DIPPING THE KITTENS. When

nothing happens, Lou DUMPS an entire box of kittens into the

tub. The cats get ANGRY and CLAW AT HIS FACE and body.

Eventually, the guys just shake their heads.

This isn't working.

Maybe these aren't the right

kittens?

Adam points at him in a "now you're thinking" way.

We'll split up. Get as many

different cats as you can. Let's

all meet back here in an hour.

You can count on me!

INT. BREW HAUS - DAY

Lou sits on a stool, munching on snacks. A TV shows the AFC

conference championship game between the Denver Broncos and

the Cleveland Browns. It's the 4th Quarter and the Browns

score with 5:43 remaining on the clock to go up by 7.

Two stools over, a SLICK-HAIRED ASSHOLE (RICK) sits with his

bored-looking HIGH SOCIETY TROPHY WIFE (CANDACE).

Yes!

Hate to tell ya, pal. Browns are

gonna lose by 3 in overtime.

73.

Eat shit and die, scumbag. I've

got ten large on this game.

Not only that, but I bet you

Elway's gonna throw a touchdown

with 37 seconds left.

Fat chance, pal. Elway's done

nothing all day.

Care to make it interesting?

Who the hell are you?

Lou thinks about the question for a moment.

Name's Musselman. Hank Musselman.

I've got a cool name, huh?

It's a good name. What did you

have in mind, Musselman?

I win -- your wife gives me a

blowjob. A classy one.

For the first time, Candace looks less than bored. She does a

bad job of feigning disinterest.

All right, buddy, fuck off.

You win -- you can kill me. Any

way you want. Knife, gun, torch,

sword... I'll even make a video

exonerating you.

Yeah, right...

I'm serious. You look like a man

who has everything. Except the

license to kill. Care to gamble?

Rick looks at Lou long and hard. Lou doesn't flinch.

74.

37 seconds?

Exactly.

You have a deal.

As Rick and Lou shake hands, Candace makes a show of looking

offended.

Don't worry, babe. This yahoo's

made a wager he can't possibly win.

Lou picks up another HANDFUL of bar snacks. He puts them in

his mouth and shows it to Rick.

Look. Who am I? I'm your wife.

Nuts in my mouth. Get it?

I like it slow and romantic.

EXT. PET STORE - DAY

Nick leaves a pet store, carrying a BOX OF KITTENS. On the

street, he accidentally bumps into one of the Japanese

businessmen from the night before. He has a THICK ACCENT,

like Gedde Watanabe in "Gung Ho."

Oh, sorry man.

Hey! How's that iPod working out

for you?

Oh, it's a very nice toy.

If you like that, I've got a phone

back at the lodge that will knock

your socks off.

I wish I could see it. But I am on

my way to a very important business

meeting.

75.

Oh yeah? More important than

Bluetooth?

My associates and I are co-

financing a... how do you say it...

supermarket business.

You're not going to Boston, by any

chance?

Yes! Boston! We leave tonight.

You're gonna franchise out the

Gelman's Mom and Pop!

Yes! How do you know this?

Nick puts his arm around the guy and walks down the street.

Walk with me a minute. Let me tell

you about some companies you should

really be looking into...

INT. THE DECK - DAY

Tad, Chaz, and Jacob enjoy drinks on a deck overlooking the

mountain ski slopes.

You really are a gas, Jacob. Tad

and I think you're the cat's

pajamas.

Thanks. I like you guys, too.

A THIRD DOUCHEBAG arrives and gives a SECRET HANDSHAKE to Tad

and Chaz. He drops off a PILL BOTTLE. This is GEOFFREY

(pronounced JOFF-rey).

Gentlemen.

76.

Geoffrey, please meet Jacob.

Excuse his Jewish name. He really

quite exceeds it.

Jacob looks confused by that, as Geoffrey shakes his hand.

Jacob, would you like some too?

He offers a pill bottle.

What is it?

Rohypnol. Geoffrey's father is a

pharmacist, but we don't hold that

against him.

Rohypnol?

You slip it to a chick who won't go

to third. Give it an hour and

you'll be rounding home.

This is a date rape drug.

What the fuck is date rape?

These are roofies!

Roofies... I like that!

Yeah, it takes the clinical name

right out of it. It sounds so

fresh, chicks might even take it

voluntarily!

Hey, can we use that?

Jacob looks beside himself.

77.

EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - AFTERNOON

A GUY and a GIRL are using the hot tub, which is still hot

and bubbly, despite the fact that it isn't plugged in.

Nick and Lou sit at the table, as Adam approaches with CATS.

I got regular cats. I figured

maybe the kitten was a fluke.

Nick takes the box out of his hands and puts it down.

Come here.

He leads Adam near the tub, where Lou points at something.

There!

What am I looking at? It's some

kind of stain.

Smell it.

I'm not smelling it.

Smell the stain.

Adam puts his nose up against the stain and SNIFFS. He

recognizes something, but can't put his finger on it.

What is that?

Red Bull.

GUY IN TUB

Hey, you fellas mind? I'm trying

to get a handjob here.

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - AFTERNOON

Our guys sit and absorb the impact of what they've learned.

78.

So you're telling me that Red Bull

plus hot tub equals time travel?

Mmm hmm. Hank Musselman's getting

the Nobel Prize.

Who the fuck is Hank Musselman?

There was just enough Red Bull for

the kitten. Not nearly enough for

a human. It's a weight

distribution thing.

How did you even figure this out?

Scientific method.

He bet me 20 dollars I wouldn't

lick the stain.

I thought it was some guy's jizz.

What's wrong with you?

It worked, didn't it?

Yeah, except one little problem.

There's no Red Bull in 1987.

For a moment, they're all bummed again. Then Adam gets an

encouraged look on his face.

Yes there is! Come on!

Adam heads for the door, as Lou and Nick follow.

EXT. BUNNY SLOPE - DAY

Jennie instructs a group of TEENAGERS on the basics of

skiing, as Adam approaches, with Nick and Lou in tow.

79.

You can't be here. If Blaine sees

you, he'll snap your neck. I told

him I blew you and he's not happy.

Why would you do that?!

Behind Adam, Nick looks at the group of TEENS and his eyes

almost BUG OUT. He elbows Lou.

(whispers, teeth clenched)

Look.

Lou looks to where Nick is looking:

YOUNG ADAM, YOUNG NICK, and YOUNG LOU wait with other kids

for Jennie to return to their lesson.

Holy shit!

Lou immediately approaches the kids, even as Nick tries to

hold him back.

where the fuck are you going?!

Lou walks right up to his YOUNGER SELF and looks himself

square in the face.

What the hell do you want, old man?

Lou PUNCHES his YOUNGER SELF in the face. Young Nick and

Young Adam are freaked out, as is regular Nick. Adam doesn't

notice, as he's arguing with Jennie.

YOUNG LOU (CONT'D)

What the fuck, dude?! I think you

broke my nose! My parents are

gonna sue the shit out of you!

Herschel and Evelyn aren't gonna do

a damn thing. They're losers.

How do you know my parents?

80.

Listen to me. Start putting

minoxidil on your scalp. Tonight.

Then, when Propecia comes on the

market, start taking it. Every

day. Hair is important.

I don't give a shit about hair.

You will!

(leans in, quietly)

Or I'll tell everyone about how you

jerked off to that issue of

Playgirl.

It was confusing! There were naked

people and it had "girl" in the

title!

Hey, you don't have to justify to

me, pal.

Who are you?

I'm God.

ON ADAM AND JENNIE

Fine. You wanna see Blaine? It's

your funeral. He's in the

warehouse at the end of Lawrence.

Good luck.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

Adam walks off the mountain with Nick and Lou.

Moment of truth.

Lou takes off his hat and feels his scalp - no hair.

81.

That fucker!

Just then, Lou's NOSE SLIGHTLY SHIFTS, the result of being

broken and never fixed. It stays this wa for the rest of

the movie.

Lou touches his nose.

Oh, that's just great.

Jacob runs up, in a friendlier disposition.

Hey guys!

I thought you were with douche

patrol.

Yeah I was. But it turned out

those guys are date rapists.

Ah.

Adam, where are we going?

Adam gets a look of determination again.

To get my bag. We get that, we

have the Red Bull, and our ticket

home.

Yes! The race is on!

What race?

Duh, it's 1987? We're at a ski

resort?

Disputes like these are settled

with a downhill ski race. Usually

at dawn. It's the law.

82.

You're an idiot.

INT. WAREHOUSE - AFTERNOON

Adam and the guys step into a warehouse. WET FLOOR, CHAINS

hanging from the ceiling for no reason, STEAM rising from

grates. As they enter, Chaz pulls down a large GARAGE DOOR.

Up ahead, Blaine sits on some CRATES with Tad.

Welcome to my lair.

You live here?

Yeah, this is kind of a shitty

place to live.

I don't live here.

Adam approaches Blaine, trying to speak maturely.

Look. Blaine. I think we got off

on the wrong foot. You have some

issue with me.

You get blown by my girl? I'll say

that's one hell of an issue.

Whoa! You got blown?!

She didn't blow me. She lied to

you to make you jealous. I'm not

trying to steal Jennie. I just

wanna get my bag.

Oh, your bag. I was wondering when

you'd come around for that.

Tad holds up the BACKPACK over by the crates.

Yeah, I'll just take it and get out

of your way.

83.

You will?

Adam EXTENDS HIS HAND.

Whattya say? Can we work this out

like gentlemen?

Blaine PULLS A KNIFE. Tad and Chaz also PULL KNIVES.

What is this town's obsession with

knives?

How about I work this out like... a

butcher?

Just then, LIGHT SPILLS INTO THE DARK WAREHOUSE. A GUY in a

polo shirt stands in a dooorway.

GUY IN POLO SHIRT

Hey! Scumbuckets! Back to work!

Like naughty children being caught red handed, Blaine and his

goons lose the knives and hustle toward the open door.

Blaine grabs the backpack from Tad.

Adam and the guys follow through the door and into --

INT. SUNGLASS HUT - DAY

Adam, Nick, Lou, and Jacob are confused, as Blaine, Chaz, and

Tad spring to action, helping CUSTOMERS choose sunglasses.

Jacob approaches Tad and Chaz, who look embarrassed.

You guys are posers! You're not

better than me!

Jacob, I wish you hadn't seen us

like this.

Adam stands near Blaine, who helps a WOMAN.

These would look so good with your

light complexion.

84.

Listen asshole! I want my bag!

Will you excuse me for a moment?

Blaine walks behind the COUNTER and SHOVES THE BAG in a SAFE.

Safe's on a timer. It'll open

tomorrow. We race at dawn. Winner

gets the bag. Loser leaves town.

Lou turns to Nick.

See? I told you!

I don't wanna race you.

Then I guess you don't want your

bag.

See you at dawn.

Your girlfriend sucks one hell of a

mean dick.

Adam makes a SLURPING SOUND and Blaine fumes.

EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - LATE AFTERNOON

Nick, Lou, and Jacob walk behind Adam, who looks pissed.

What are we gonna do?

That chick blew you?!

I've got a race to win.

Europe's "The Final Countdown" begins playing over a MONTAGE:

-- Skis are sharpened.

85.

-- Gear is polished.

-- In the SUITE, Adam gets dressed in his GEAR.

-- On a SMALL HILL, Jacob demonstrates some moves on skis.

Adam doesn't get it. He's keeps falling.

-- On the hill, Jacob teaches Adam how to SNOWBOARD. Adam is

having an easier time standing up on the snowboard.

-- The guys keep Adam awake and use a homemade SCALE MODEL of

the mountain to formulate a plan, a la Iron Eagle.

-- Back on the hill, Jacob and Adam snowboard next to each

other. Adam makes it by a couple of obstacles. Jacob looks

proud of him.

-- The guys play an ATARI SKI GAME, trying out a strategy.

Jacob uses a POINTER, looking disappointed.

-- On the hill, Adam easily maneuvers by a few trees on the

snowboard, kicking up snow and HIGH-FINING Jacob.

EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - DAWN

SLO-MO HERO SHOT of our four guys, as they ascend the top of

the mountain. If we didn't know any better, it would look

like Tony Scott directed a ski movie.

END MONTAGE.

EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - DAY

A few yards away from Nick and Lou, Adam sits on the ground,

as Jacob helps him strap into the snowboard.

Just stick to the plan and you're

gonna be fine.

Adam looks at Jacob seriously for a moment.

Jacob, I'm sorry for not always

being the big brother I should've

been. I was away at college, Mom

gave you my Sega - there were a

whole host of issues.

Jacob nods and speaks genuinely to Adam too.

86.

I know. I'm sorry too. I put a

few things before my family and

took my guilt out on you.

(puts it together)

I guess it was an inevitable I'd

end up part of a roofie ring.

Adam smiles and extends his hand.

Friends?

Jacob takes Adam's hand and helps him to his feet.

Brothers.

They EMBRACE. Lou looks disgusted.

Gay.

Blaine and his goons approach from below. Adam puts on his

game face.

I didn't think you guys would show.

This was my idea.

It's gonna make my victory taste

all the more sweeter. Like a Peach

Snapple.

A what?

You'll see.

Blaine actually looks rattled, as the two men get lined up.

Adam is on a SNOWBOARD.

What's that?

You're not afraid of getting beat

by a guy on a skateboard, are you?

87.

I've seen you in action. You're

reckless and terrible.

Reckless and terrible's my middle

name. Because I feel the need...

(pulls on goggles)

for speed!

Chaz holds out his arm as a starting line.

Catch ya at the bottom.

3, 2, 1... GO!

Blaine takes off down the mountain like a professional

skiier, which he pretty much is. Adam looks toward Jacob,

who demonstrates the proper CROUCH. Adam slowly picks up

speed, starting at about one mile per hour.

Blaine looks back and can't believe how easily he's gonna

coast to victory.

Here goes nothing.

Instead of weaving back and forth, Adam just stays in the

crouch, PICKING UP SPEED. He recklessly PASSES BLAINE,

despite the many TREES and OBSTACLES on the course.

He BEARS DOWN AND TRAVELS LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING!

Blaine finds the guts to alter his STYLE, skiing more

recklessly too. He begins catching up to Adam.

Blaine skis up next to Adam - they're both going full force.

You can't beat me! I was born on

this mountain!

I was born in a hospital like a

normal baby!

Adam bends down and picks up even more speed, NARROWLY

MISSING trees and rocks. Blaine tries to keep up.

Adam has the finish line in his sights, when he rolls the

dice once too often. His SNOWBOARD GETS SNAGGED on a rock

and Adam TUMBLES TO THE GROUND.

88.

The SNOWBOARD FLIES OFF INTO THE AIR!

EXT. MOUNTAIN / BASE - DAY

Phil stands against a SHED, as a GUY THROWS A HATCHET at him,

just narrowly missing his arm. Phil FLEXES HIS MUSCLES, as a

HOT CHICK KISSES HIM.

Then the SNOWBOARD FLIES INTO FRAME and SLICES OFF PHIL'S

ARM, sending BLOOD SPLATTER EVERYWHERE!

Ahhhh! My arm!!!

EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - DAY - SAME TIME

Lou watches with BINOCULARS and PUMPS HIS FIST.

Yes!

EXT. MOUNTAIN - RACE - DAY

As Adam tumbles on the ground, Blaine smiles, thinking he has

the victory in the bag.

But instead of stopping, Adam picks up speed, as he TUMBLES

LIMB OVER LIMB, like a snowball going down the mountain.

With 50 YARDS to go, Blaine bears down and tries to catch

Adam. It's gonna be close.

At the FINISH LINE, Adam's CRUMPLED BODY passes the line

first. Blaine pulls up, pissed off to lose the race.

Adam's momentum carries him forward another 50 yards, where

he SMASHES INTO A DECK and finally comes to a stop.

A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE POPS!

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE AFTERNOON

A large "BON VOYAGE" BANNER hangs in the room.

89.

An ALL-OUT PARTY is going on in the guys' suite. GUESTS

party everywhere, helping the guys celebrate.

Sandy and Michelle flirt with the two dudes who took brief

possession of the Towel Guy yesterday.

The Coke Guy from the gondola talks with the Brew Haus

Waitress.

Adam's leg is in a CAST, as he sits at a table with Jacob,

Nick, and Lou. The OPEN BACKPACK is in front of them. They

DRINK and TOAST.

You did it, man.

Ah, it was nothing. I just fell

down the mountain.

It was a beautiful fall.

Lou goes into Adam's backpack and pulls out the SANDWICH,

which he begins unwrapping.

Tell me you are not going to keep

eating that.

Lou takes a bite and SHRUGS.

Chicken parm. It's my favorite.

Chicken parm?

Adam takes the sandwich from Lou. He looks at it closely.

Chicken parm. On this roll.

The guys look confused, as Adam stares at the sandwich.

Adam, what is it?

90.

INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Adam and Lily nervously make eye contact at the front of the

restaurant, as a SNOOTY HOST shakes his head.

ADAM (V.0.)

It was our first date. You know

those nights that are just perfect?

This wasn't one of those nights.

INT. MOVIE THEATER - DARK

Adam and Lily sit through "From Justin to Kelly," the

American Idol movie. They don't enjoy themselves.

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Adam inspects a HUGE DENT in the side of his car. As he does

so, a car drives by, SPLASHING A PUDDLE on Lily.

ADAM (V.0.)

If Lily knew where we were, I'm

sure she would've walked home. And

I wouldn't have blamed her.

EXT. ITALIAN DELI - NIGHT

In the RAIN, Adam and Lily run toward the entrance of a

little deli. Inside the doorway, a LITTLE OLD WOMAN shakes

her head no. Adam pleads with his eyes and she lets them in.

INT. ITALIAN DELI - NIGHT

Adam and Lily sit and talk animatedly at the counter in the

small, empty deli, eating SANDWICHES.

ADAM (V.0.)

We were so hungry by the time we

found that deli, we would've eaten

anything. So what if it wasn't

foie gras and pino noir. It was

chicken parm and Italian soda. And

it couldn't have been more perfect.

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - DAY

The guys enjoy listening to Adam's story.

91.

That sandwich was special, huh?

You could say that. You could also

say it gave me horrible diarrhea.

INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT / BATHROOM - NIGHT

Adam SHITS HIS BRAINS OUT. When it looks like. he might be

done, he turns around and VOMITS into the toilet.

INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lily waits by the bathroom door with some PEPTO and a GLASS

OF WATER. She looks very concerned.

ADAM (V.0.)

Lily had every opportunity to

leave. She didn't know me at all

and she certainly didn't owe me

anything after the night I put her

through. But she stayed.

INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Adam lays on the couch, his head in Lily's lap. She feeds

him a little GATORADE. He keeps it down... for a moment.

Then he turns and VOMITS into a BUCKET on the floor.

ADAM (V.0.)

She saw me at my worst and she

stayed.

Lily holds the bucket, as Adam pukes into it.

INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - DAY

Nick, Lou, and Jacob look sick.

Don't you see? This is more than a

sandwich. It represents all that

shit. All that puke.

92.

Keep the sandwich.

This is disgusting.

She gave me this as a reminder of

her love.

Or to give me horrible diarrhea so

I didn't leave the room during the

bachelor party. But mostly as a

reminder of her love.

Adam holds up the sandwich.

This is the reason I need to go

home.

Adam stands up and walks toward the door with the sandwich.

I'm gonna go prep the tub.

Lou holds up a BAG OF CHIPS.

Do you have any stories about these

chips or can I eat them?

EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - CONTINUOUS

Adam walks outside, taking a bite of the SANDWICH. He finds

Jennie waiting in the TUB.

There you are!

Jennie! What are you doing here?

Making good on a rumor.

Jennie STANDS UP in the tub and she's TOPLESS.

Adam DROPS THE SANDWICH, shocked.

Whoa.

93.

Jennie continues talking, shamelessly exposing herself.

When I saw you win that race

against Blaine, everything changed

for me. I realize now that I

deserve more. I deserve a winner.

Come and get your prize.

Adam reaches next to the tub and hands her a ROBE.

Yeah, I... can't.

She covers up, embarrassed.

Oh my god. I missed my

opportunity.

No, I'm not sure there ever was an

opportunity. Jennie, you're

terrific. You've brought me so

many moments of joy, you'll never

know. But I shouldn't have given

you the wrong idea.

Jennie looks sad and vulnerable, as Adam talks.

The truth is there's a girl I need

to go see. We have plans to spend

the rest of our lives together.

And I can't wait any longer.

(listening to himself)

And I'm totally cool with it.

Adam smiles, feeling the rush of knowing he's ready. But

then he sees how sad Jennie is. He moves closer to her.

One day, you're going to find the

right guy who's willing to give up

everything and travel across time

and space for your love.

She nods and tears up a little bit, as Adam HUGS her.

I would totally blow you right now.

94.

I know you would.

EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

The guys stare at the tub, which continues to bubble, even

though it's not plugged in.

We don't have to go yet, Adam.

Things are just getting fun.

And we can do whatever we want

without any real consequences.

That's a lot to give up.

That's how I know I'm doing the

right thing.

Adam reaches in his backpack, but can't find the Red Bull.

He turns it inside out and shakes it -- nothing.

Where's the Red Bull?

BLAINE (V.0.)

You looking for this?

Across the patio, a drunk, disheveled Blaine holds the CAN.

You couldn't leave well enough

alone, could ya? You couldn't just

win the race and call it a day?

You had to have Jennie too.

I don't want Jennie.

That's funny. I don't want this

soda, either.

Blaine smiles like an asshole. Adam's face goes desperate,

as Blaine OPENS THE CAN and DRINKS THE WHOLE THING.

Nooooo!

95.

Adam runs at Blaine and tackles him to the ground. On the

ground, Adam BEATS THE LIVING HELL out of Blaine, messing up

his face. It makes the Jared Leto scene from Fight Club look

tame. Eventually, Adam's friends pull him off.

Adam crawls to the Red Bull can and it's empty.

Why?

Lou takes Blaine's pulse.

Holy shit! You may have killed

this guy! No wait... wait... I've

got a pulse. Eh, so much for that.

Nick puts his hand on Adam's shoulder.

I'm sorry man. I'm really sorry.

The Red Bull's gone. He fucked us.

Not necessarily.

Everyone looks toward Jacob.

The Red Bull isn't really gone.

(points to Blaine)

It's in him.

A beat, as everyone sorta gets it.

It's worth a shot.

TIME CUT TO:

EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

Adam, Nick, and Jacob sit in the tub. Adam crosses his

fingers.

Lou stands outside the tub, fully dressed.

Come on, Lou.

96.

Nah, I'll take a rain check.

What are you talking about?

Listen, your lives at home sound

all beautiful and happy with your

barbecues and swimming pools and

"oh, that sandwich reminds of some

gay shit I did one time."

Adam and Nick don't look thrilled to be reduced to this.

But my life back there sucks. And

in case you haven't noticed, my

life here fucking rules. So I have

a coke problem? I'll go to rehab.

I have no money? I'll stop winning

sex and start winning dollars.

Lou DRAGS BLAINE by the foot closer to the tub.

Guys, I was tailor-made for 1987.

And you'll excuse me, but I value

banging young chicks way more than

all of your friendships combined.

No offense.

Adam, Nick, and Jacob kinda nod and understand.

Yeah, no, I get it.

Lou goes around and gives them all hugs.

Makes perfect sense, man.

Lou squeezes Jacob's shoulder.

I don't hate you as much as I used

to.

(a little emotional)

I hate you a little less also.

Lou LIFTS BLAINE'S LIMP BODY.

97.

OK, whenever you're ready, Lou.

One small step for man! One giant

asshole puking in a hot tub! Here

goes nothing!

Lou does the HEIMLICH MANEUVER on Blaine. It takes ONE...

TWO... THREE THRUSTS until Blaine PUKES IN THE TUB! For a

second, it's just a BIG SPLASH of VOMIT and nothing else.

OK, well maybe if we--

A BRIGHT FLASH CONSUMES THE SCREEN! And when it dies down,

we see Adam, Nick, Jacob (and the floating puke) in the hot

tub where we left them.

Only Lou is missing.

What happened? Did it work?

I didn't feel anything.

Guys, look.

They see PEOPLE walking by, wearing COLORFUL FLARED-OUT SKI

ATTIRE. The place looks the same as it did two seconds ago.

Dammit. Even the deck furniture's

the same. We fucking blew it. It

didn't work.

Where's Lou?

LOU (O.S.)

Right on schedule!

SURGERY (including a fixed NOSE) that makes him look at once

older and younger.

Ahhh!

98.

Oh, the face, eh? I was curious

how you'd react.

Didn't think you'd be scared.

Lou?

You're damn right it's me.

What happened?

You just traveled 23 years in three

seconds. Took me 23 years. It's

good to see you guys!

We're back? It all looks the same.

It better! You know how much I pay

the groundspeople around here? A

lot. But that's all right, I'm

fucking loaded. Look at all this.

Everyone looks confused.

Will you fill in some of the blanks

for me, please?

I'll give you the short version,

because time is of the essence.

First of all, to settle an old bet,

time most definitely has been

moving forward. It is exactly

three days since you've arrived

here in beautiful Havenhurst.

Jacob looks at Nick.

Told you.

Secondly, I'm filthy rich. Made

sports bets. Sued Ace of Base. I

own most of V

ermont. (MORE)

99.

I've been reimagining the state as

my own personal playground. You

could say I'm a little bit like

Michael Jackson, except I don't

fuck kids.

Two YOUNG HOTTIES walk by and wave at Lou.

I do fuck them, though. Haven't

gone above 24 years old in 10 years

and even then, it was a mistake.

A horrible mistake.

Wait, fuck, Lou what time is it?

Way ahead of you, Adam. You have 2

hours to get to New Jersey in time

for your rehearsal dinner.

Great, I blew it.

Not even a little bit. I have a

helicopter waiting in the parking

lot and a private jet on my

airfield five minutes away.

The guys look stunned.

I had some time to plan. God, it's

good to have you guys back!

EXT. PRIVATE AIRFIELD - AFTERNOON

Lou's private jet takes off from the runway.

INT. PRIVATE JET - AFTERNOON

The guys sit back and enjoy the plush surroundings and the

beautiful FLIGHT ATTENDANTS aboard Lou's jet.

By the way, Adam, I hope you don't

mind. Right after you left, I

fucked Jennie silly.

100.

Why would she have sex with you?

You get the big time assist. All

that talk of her finding the right

guy who's willing to give up

everything? Made her wetter than a

log flume.

She's all-time top five.

Good to hear.

Lou, I gotta ask you something.

Time travel paradox.

Exactly. Aren't there now two of

you living here in 2010?

Think really hard about that one.

What happened to me when I was 19?

Nick shrugs. He looks at Adam. Suddenly, both their eyes

nearly pop out of their skulls.

No way...

You went missing and were never

found.

Yeah, you're gonna have some

lingering memories of both

versions.

Wait a minute, what happened to...

you know. Other Lou.

You don't wanna know.

Lou...

101.

The kid sucked, OK? He couldn't

take even a little bit of

direction. Pretty soon I realized

that having two versions of the

same dude walking around -- as cool

as that sounds -- didn't make very

much sense to me.

OK?

So I took care of the problem.

What did you do?

I had to do it.

What did you do?

I killed myself.

Jesus Christ.

Yeah, it was really some

existential shit. I mean, here I

am committing homicide and I'm

actually committing suicide.

How could you?

It was easy actually. For a

minute, I thought I might be

dealing with that whole Timecop

thing. You know, the same matter

can't occupy the same space at the

same time bullshit and we both go

poof? Especially after that whole

nose thing. But no, it was just a

murder. I didn't suffer.

I don't wanna hear any more.

102.

It was strangulation.

I don't wanna hear any more!

They sit in horrified silence for a bit.

You'll have to introduce me when we

get there. Your families won't

know me. Although I'm sure they're

huge fans.

So hey, getting married, huh?

Taking the plunge!

Adam looks disturbed. Nick looks confused.

This makes no sense at all.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Lily looks beautiful, surrounded by FAMILY and FRIENDS.

Still, she looks distant and lonely. Until --

A LILY (the flower) comes into frame.

Lily smiles and stands up. She turns around. Adam's

standing there with a whole bouquet of flowers. Lily gives

him a BIG HUG AND KISS. When she's done:

Don't you ever let me take your

phone again!

I'm here on time. Just like I

promised.

Nick sits down next to COURTNEY and Jacob takes his seat.

(no nerves at all)

I'm so happy to see you and I can't

wait to spend the rest of my life

with you.

Me too!

103.

You're the one.

Lily notices Adam's on CRUTCHES.

Oh my god, what happened?

LOU (O.S.)

My fault entirely, madam!

The room is ABUZZ with CHATTER, as Lou makes a nearly REGAL

ENTRANCE, wearing a WHITE TUXEDO.

GUY AT TABLE

Hey, it's Lou Blustein!

The whole room APPLAUDS Lou, as he walks in. Adam and the

guys can't believe it.

I was partaking in a little ski

adventure and I mistakenly wandered

into your fiance's path. His

broken leg is my broken heart. My

most humble apologies.

Lou scrapes and bows and regally kisses Lily's hand. She

looks genuinely flattered.

Lou gets up and whispers to Adam.

See? I'm awesome here. You

shoulda stayed out of that tub.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - LATER

Nick SLOW DANCES with Courtney.

I was thinking we'd invite Adam and

Lily over for dinner when they get

back from their honeymoon.

That's... if it's OK with you?

Why wouldn't it be OK with me?

That sounds nice.

104.

You look so good in this shirt, by

the way. Nice choice.

She puts her head on Nick's shoulder as they dance.

So... how are your parents?

Still working hard. I really wish

they could retire already, but it's

tough competing with the big

chains. I mean, they just have the

one store...

EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - 1987 - DAY

The Japanese Businessman is on a PAY PHONE, speaking RAPIDLY

in Japanese.

Hiro-san! Cancel the paperwork!

We have to get back to Tokyo. I

have inside information that

undermines the supermarket deal.

Nick stands next to him, nodding and SMILING WIDELY.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY

Nick enjoys dancing with his mellow, awesome wife.

You know what they say about hard

work. Builds character.

BY THE BAR

Adam orders drinks, as his PHONE RINGS. He picks it up and

in an instant, JACOB IS STANDING RIGHT BEFORE HIM as a VERY

REALISTIC HOLOGRAM.

Ahh!

105.

This is why we shouldn't have sold

that iPod.

Adam puts his hand through Jacob, who speaks with purpose.

The Japanese have apparently

cornered the technology sector over

the past 20 years. We've dealt

American businesses quite an

irreparable blow.

What does that mean for us?

Pretty much nothing for us

personally. We just get cooler

phones and iPods and shit.

Oh. Great!

Jacob CLICKS OFF and disappears, as Lily approaches. Adam

can't help but beam from ear to ear.

You're so beautiful.

I know you were only gone for a

couple days, but I missed you so

much.

Adam takes her hand.

Come on, let's get out of here. We

have unfinished business.

Lily smiles. She gets into it.

It's about time. OK, what's the

fantasy?

How about you're the woman I love

and I'm the man of your dreams?

Booor-ing!!

106.

OK, you're a nurse and a snake bit

my penis.

Done and done.

They bolt for the door and we

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - LATER

The party is winding down and only a FEW GUESTS remain. At a

table in the corner, Lou has an EXTENDED MAKE OUT SESSION

with a STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL in her early 20s.

They finally come up for air.

So you're friends with the bride?

Can you keep a secret? I'm

actually kinda crashing the party.

Naughty girl. You're secret's safe

with me.

I'm just in town for a couple of

nights. I'm actually looking for

my father. We've never met.

I'm from here. Maybe I know him.

His name is Hank Musselman.

For a moment, Lou's expression FREEZES. He blinks. Then --

No, never heard of him.

He goes back to MAKING OUT WITH HER and we:

FADE OUT.
