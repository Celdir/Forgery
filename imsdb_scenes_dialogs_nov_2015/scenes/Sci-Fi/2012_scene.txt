OVER BLACK

We listen to the immortal music of Mozart's Adagio of the

Clarinet Concerto in A.

EXT. THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Space, infinite and empty.

But then, slowly all nine planets of our Solar System move

into frame and align.

The last of them is the giant, burning sphere of the sun.

Just as the sun enters frame, a solar storm of gigantic

proportion unfolds. The eruptions shoot thousands of miles

into the blackness of space.

EXT. COUNTRY SIDE/INDIA - SUNSET

Mozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the

drumming sounds of the monsoon rain. PROF. FREDERIC WEST, 66,

listens to the music.

An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy

ship across a puddle.

The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy.

But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the

puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship.

In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The

driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance.

The sign at the door reads: `Institute for Astrophysics -

University of New Delhi'.

INT. NAGA-DENG MINE/INDIA - SUNSET

An endless mine shaft. An old elevator cage comes to a

grinding halt. When Prof. West steps out we see that he is

accompanied now by a nervous DR. SATNAM TSURUTANI, 32.

As Prof. West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting

for this science lab.

They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small

group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all

show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier.

Satnam walks over into another room. There he opens a hatch

on the floor and hot steam rises.

Prof. West slowly steps closer. When he discovers that the

water in the tank below is boiling, his face goes pale.

EXT. LARGE TERRACE/WASHINGTON D.C. - EVENING

A major fund raising party is under way. The setting is

spectacular. A terrace overlooking the Washington Mall and

the Capitol Building.

ADRIAN HELMSLEY, 32, stands with a group of young POLITICAL

AIDES. He is the only African-American among them.

One of the aides spots CARL ANHEUSER, 58, White House Chief

of Staff, working the crowd.

Adrian turns to see Anheuser smiling.

Anheuser walks away with a dangerous smile.

At that moment Adrian's cell phone rings.

INT. LIVING ROOM/SATNAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Prof. West is on the phone. In the background we make out

Satnam's family around the dining room table.

Satnam quiets his little son. It is the boy we saw earlier

with his toy ship.

INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Adrian follows Anheuser through a hallway of the White House,

papers in hand.

Exasperated, Adrian holds out the papers to him.

Finally, Anheuser rips the papers out of his hands and starts

to walk away, reading.

Suddenly he slows down.

Anheuser walks away.

EXT. SEVILLE/SPAIN - DAY

G8 Summit. Riot police control the unruly crowd with water

cannons.

We see PROTESTERS with Anti Globalization signs behind a

fence. A convoy of limousines is approaching a historic

building.

INT. BIG HALL/ALHAMBRA - DAY

We follow the American delegation into the conference room,

where the other G8 delegations are seated around an enormous

table.

The President of the United States, THOMAS F. WILSON, 56,

doesn't sit down. He addresses the room and everybody goes

quiet.

For the first time we see the President's face. He is African-

American.

A murmur erupts. The Russian President SERGEY MAKARENKO, 62,

whispers to one of his interpreters.

President Wilson looks over to the Russian Colleague.

As the Russian President waves his interpreter away, all the

international delegates leave as well.

The huge doors of the hall close. A secret service officer in

the sound booth switches off the recording equipment to the

chamber.

The President gathers himself.

Dead silence.

EXT. CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN

A huge Chinese military helicopter blasts through a majestic

mountain valley in Tibet. We are at the top of the world.

A Chinese COLONEL, wearing dark sun glasses, watches from the

chopper as the army forces the evacuation of the villages and

monasteries.

EXT. VILLAGE/TIBET - DAY

Someone speaks on a megaphone in the village square as

villagers are evicted by soldiers and herded into trucks.

NENG PANG, a young monk, 18, is loaded into a truck together

with his PARENTS, both in their 60's.

EXT. SCHOOL/TIBET - DAY

Neng's older brother, LIN PANG, 25, is part of a huge crowd

of young men and women staying behind by a Tibetan school

building. He turns and yells after the truck.

The Colonel with the dark glasses steps up, addressing the

masses.

Eager hands fly up in the air. An official makes notes.

Lin's hand shoots up in the air. We hear a siren echoing

through the mountains and suddenly an explosion. Lin turns.

In the BACKGROUND, a series of explosions punch enormous

holes into the side of the mountain, showering rock

everywhere.

INT. DORCHESTER HOTEL/LONDON - DAY

A MAN in a dark suit walks through a hallway of the

Dorchester looking like your typical MI-6 agent. The decor is

plush and luxurious. He's stopped by two security men who

frisk him.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE/DORCHESTER HOTEL - DAY

Heavily ringed fingers flip through a folder.

A SAUDI PRINCE looks up and nods without expression.

INT. LOUVRE/PARIS - NIGHT

A group of dark figures in overalls walk past famous

Renaissance paintings. They stop at the Mona Lisa.

MANFRED PICARD, 63, head of the French National Museums,

stands by LAURA, a young African-American woman in her late

20's. They observe the specialists opening the case of the

famous painting.

A whoosh of air as the vacuum seal breaks.

Laura answers in almost perfect French.

In the BACKGROUND the Mona Lisa is taken off the wall and

replaced with a perfect replica. Picard still looks uneasy.

He watches as the real Mona Lisa is sealed into an airtight

case.

Picard looks suspicious but says nothing. The CAMERA MOVES IN

on the face of the fake Mona Lisa until all we see is her

mysterious smile.

FUZZY TV IMAGES:

Lifeless bodies encircle a huge fire pit. They resemble the

rays of the sun. In the background we see the famous step

pyramids of Tikal.

Many of the dead are women and children looking peaceful and

are surrounded by colorful flowers.

The CAMERA slowly pulls out and we are in--

INT. JACKSON'S APARTMENT/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING

A shabby apartment in Silverlake. The TV is on.

A small tremor rocks the apartment and the dishevelled face

of JACKSON CURTIS, 33, pops up from behind the couch. He fell

asleep at his laptop last night.

One look at his watch and he is off running. He throws some

clothes and a toothbrush in a bag. His cell phone rings.

Jackson turns off the TV and darts towards the door, stopping

only to slide his laptop into a knapsack. As he turns, he

stumbles over a stack of books, all shrink-wrapped and

identically titled: `Farewell Atlantis'.

Frustrated, he kicks them out of his way and exits. We hold

on the books and realize that Jackson's photograph is on

their back covers.

EXT. JACKSON'S GARAGE/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING

The phone call continues as Jackson opens the garage door,

struggling to pack his old SUV with camping equipment.

He tries to start the engine, but the battery is dead.

Frustrated, he hits the steering wheel.

EXT. JACKSON'S STREET/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING

Jackson runs across the street with his camping equipment,

throwing it into the trunk of a stretch limo parked by the

curb.

He notices a deep crack in the asphalt. His neighbors, an

elderly couple, stand there and stare at it.

Jackson gets into the limo and speeds off.

INT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING

Jackson drives through LA with the radio on.

We pass a family frantically loading boxes into a van.

Jackson passes a man in a wheelchair. He's holding up a

cardboard sign: `Repent - The End is Near'.

EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING

Jackson stops and honks in front of an upscale Westwood home.

Jackson switches the radio off. Two kids NOAH, 10, and LILLY,

7, come running down the driveway. They slow down, as they

see the limo.

Lilly yells from inside the limo.

Their mother, KATE CURTIS, 32, a beautiful woman appears.

Kate's new boyfriend, GORDON SILBERMAN, 43, pulls out of the

garage in his Porsche wearing his Bluetooth.

Jackson smiles bitterly. Gordon waves at the kids.

Jackson waves grudgingly as Gordon pulls away.

She follows Jackson to the car with a bag of pull-up diapers.

He shuts the trunk and gets back behind the wheel. She looks

at him seriously.

He nods as the car pulls away.

EXT. SHIP DECK/SAN FRANCISCO HARBOR - DAY

HARRY HELMSLEY, 73, and his partner TONY DELGADO, 68, board

an enormous cruise ship, the `Freedom of the Seas'. Harry is

African-American, Tony is Italian. He carries a large case.

They pass a poster: `Jazz Night with Harry Helmsley & Tony

Delgado'.

TONY shoots a charmers smile at a couple of older single

ladies on sun loungers. They smile back coyly.

Suddenly they're thrown off balance by a large swell that

pulls the massive `Freedom of the Seas' away from the

landing, about ten yards.

The next moment, the ship slams back against the dock with an

earthshaking BOOM.

A murmur goes through the crowd. Luckily nobody is injured.

INT. LAURA'S BEDROOM/D.C. - EARLY MORNING

The phone rings twice before Laura switches on a light. We

catch a glimpse of a framed photo of her and Adrian. She

answers the phone.

EXT. STREETS/PARIS - NIGHT

Picard is speeding in his Peugeot, anxiously checking his

rear view mirror.

Picard's car approaches a tunnel.

The Peugeot enters a tunnel.

A huge blast rips through the tunnel as his car explodes.

EXT. ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

They're driving through the glorious landscape of Yellowstone

National Park. Noah sits in the back with headphones on

playing Space-Busters 2.

As they pass over a ridge, the music station is overpowered

by a talk show filtering through. We hear a raspy and

excitable voice.

Lilly reaches for the dial of the radio.

Jackson corrects the dial to get better reception.

A huge black helicopter brushes over the limo.

They watch in awe as the chopper disappears behind a ridge.

INT. OVAL OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

Laura bursts in and heads straight for the TV. The President

looks up from his desk.

Sally the President's Secretary enters, flustered.

Sally closes the door as Laura turns up the TV.

The President comes around his desk. Laura looks at him

distraught.

The President shoots an anxious look across the room. Laura

turns and suddenly realizes that Adrian is standing in the

corner.

Adrian looks ashamed.

EXT. FOREST TRAIL/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

A dense forest trail. We hear Lilly before we see her.

Jackson runs to catch up with Lilly who has reached a fence

with a `keep out' sign posted.

Jackson starts to climb the fence.

EXT. RIDGE/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

Jackson and his kids crest a ridge. They look down on a

parched basin with cracked terrain.

The kids roll their eyes.

EXT. EMPTY LAKE BED/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

A puddle of water is all that remains of the lake. Jackson

and the kids walk into the basin, unaware of being watched

THROUGH BINOCULARS.

Jackson spots an electronic measuring device and crouches to

have a closer look.

Elsewhere in the lake bed, we see sand seeping through CRACKS

in the ground.

When he looks up, he sees heavily armed soldiers coming

towards them from all sides.

Through the BINOCULARS, we see Jackson and his kids arrested

and led over a ridge.

With this we reveal an ENORMOUS RESEARCH FACILITY with

hundreds of tents and vehicles surrounding a massive drilling

tower.

EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

Adrian Helmsley and Prof. West exit the drilling tower, both

studying papers. Adrian notices Jackson and his kids nearby,

being interrogated by an OFFICER.

Adrian walks towards them. Jackson stares at the officer with

defiance.

Jackson turns and sees Adrian standing there.

The officer reluctantly hands him Jackson's license.

He throws a look at Jackson's drivers license.

He looks up at Jackson with renewed interest.

Jackson straightens up proudly. Lilly smiles.

Prof. West waves at Adrian from one of the container labs.

Adrian hands back Jackson his drivers license.

Jackson and his kids look after Adrian hurrying away.

EXT. FOREST TRAIL/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - LATER

Jackson and the kids walk back to the campgrounds when

suddenly CHARLIE FROST, 62, a crazy looking guy with

binoculars around his neck, stands in their way.

Jackson looks at him, instinctively picking up Lilly.

Charlie bursts out laughing.

With this he turns around and leaves.

EXT. TENT/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK

Jackson is sitting on a camp chair, right outside the tent.

He's on his laptop, looking enquiringly at an aerial picture

of Yellowstone on Google earth.

In the background we see the kids are in the tent.

Jackson looks up, remembering he forgot the spray.

Lilly nods as Jackson walks over and tucks her into bed. He

kisses her good night. He turns and is surprised to see Noah

typing a text on his cell phone.

Jackson takes the phone from out of Noah's hands.

Jackson reads the message Noah has typed `Hey Gordon, Camping

Sucks!'. Hurt, Jackson hands back the phone.

EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK

Commotion. The base packs up. Adrian and Prof. West duck low

as they board a chopper. Adrian is on the phone.

We hear Anheuser, yelling.

A second later the chopper lifts off.

INT. LIMO/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK

Jackson has his laptop open with the cursor blinking away on

the words `Chapter Seven'. But he can't concentrate on

writing after what Noah has said.

A chopper flies overhead. Jackson follows it's path over the

campsite and his eyes fall on an American flag fluttering on

top of a massive radio antennae. This belongs to an RV truck.

Through the RV's window, Jackson sees the silhouette of

Charlie Frost, the guy with the binoculars, speaking into a

microphone.

Curious, Jackson flicks on the radio and twists the dial.

Jackson is intrigued. He puts his laptop down.

Jackson climbs out of his car and starts towards the RV. He

can still hear the radio.

INT. CHARLIE'S RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK

Charlie hits a switch. Music starts playing. The Doors, `The

End'.

Charlie is about to take a bite of his sandwich, when there's

a knock on the door. Jackson sticks his head in.

Charlie bites into his sandwich as Jackson looks around at

all the equipment.

Charlie looks at his watch.

Charlie clicks on his laptop.

A crudely animated film starts to play. Charlie narrates on

screen in an overly dramatic fashion.

Charlie appears as an animated figure holding an orange.

On screen the middle of the orange shrinks, now the skin

moves freely around it.

A faded portrait of a scientist appears on screen.

The infamous photo of Einstein, sticking out his tongue.

The film ends with an image of the whole earth covered with

water.

Charlie shuts the laptop.

Charlie opens a can of beer. Phsssh!

Jackson shakes his head still struggling to digest this.

Charlie looks at him bug eyed.

As Jackson exits, Charlie gets back on the air.

EXT. PARKING LOT OF SUPERMARKET/LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

Westwood. The parking lot of Gelson's is nearly empty.

Eerie silence. Suddenly some of the cars begin to shift in

place from an unseen force. A small CRACK creases the asphalt

and slowly crawls towards the brightly lit supermarket.

INT. BETWEEN AISLES/SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Muzak is playing. Kate and her boyfriend Gordon are shopping

late. She picks up some pull-ups for Lilly, Gordon steps up

behind her, wrapping his arms around her waist.

He reaches up and touches her breasts.

Gordon lets go of her with mock disappointment.

Kate pushes him away and moves on.

A few customers are paying at the checkout stand.

BEHIND THEM: Huge glass windows reveal cars slowly sliding

into the ever widening crack in the parking lot. Nobody

inside notices.

Gordon catches up with Kate.

Kate smiles awkwardly and picks up a can of soup. The shelf

in front of her shakes for a moment.

Kate slowly puts the cans of soup into her cart and looks

around. Gordon senses a problem between them.

Before Gordon finishes his sentence--

A violent ROAR! From front to back, the entire supermarket

rips open right between Kate and Gordon.

The few customers scream in horror at the sight of the huge

crevasse forming beneath them. Kate and Gordon are thrown up

against opposite aisles holding on for dear life.

They cling to the columns as the shelves fold into the ever

widening crack...

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE/YELLOWSTONE - MORNING

Jackson puts down some groceries at the checkout.

He smiles at the female cashier behind the counter who does

not look friendly.

The woman looks at Lilly and Noah with their red lumps.

She slams two mosquito products on the counter.

On the store's TV: A heavy-set blonde WOMAN, 45, speaking to

a reporter in front of Gelson's.

The gap in the ground is enormous now, at least half a mile

long and 200 feet wide.

INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

President Wilson and Anheuser walk towards the Situation

Room.

The President is shocked by this news.

Anheuser fumes as they enter the situation room.

INT. SITUATION ROOM/WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

Flat screens line the walls. A video conference is under way

with each of the G8 members represented.

He looks over to Adrian.

Adrian steps up and gathers himself. Anheuser watches.

Pointing to a set of charts.

All the heads of state are glued to his words.

The German Chancellor, a woman, interrupts.

Adrian glances to Professor West, standing in the back.

The Prime Minister of Italy breaks in, upset.

President Wilson steps up.

We hear CHEERING and APPLAUSE.

INT. BOXING ARENA OF MGM GRAND/LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

The arena is filled to its max. The crowd is on its feet.

The crowd ROARS as the boxer and his entourage enter.

The CAMERA moves in on a tall man with blonde clean cut hair.

He is well built, wearing designer clothing from head to toe.

YURI KARPOV, 45, stereotypical Russian oligarch.

He approaches the ringside corner and whistles.

The nervous boxer turns.

Yuri hits the boxer's gloves. Zultan is nervous. His coach

steps in.

Zultan just keeps nodding, pumping himself up.

GONG. First Round. The fight is on.

Yuri walks to his seat, sitting down next to his trophy:

TAMARA, 28, blonde, wears the shortest mini one can imagine,

designer shoes, handbag, glasses and boobs. In her lap she

holds CAESAR, a tiny dog wearing a diamond collar.

In the ring the boxers maul at each other. Yuri's cell phone

beeps. It's a text message:

START BOARDING PROCEDURE

Yuri's whole demeanor changes. Without a word, he gets up and

walks out of the arena.

Yuri does not respond as he squeezes through the crowd.

Zultan, the boxer, notices Yuri leave. In that split second

distraction, he is hit HARD and goes down for the count.

The crowd ROARS!

EXT. WESTWOOD/LOS ANGELES - SUNRISE

Jackson has driven all night. The sun rises, a giant glowing

orb.

EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING

Jackson pulls up. The kids are asleep.

Jackson switches off the radio and wakes his kids gently.

Kate heads to the car. Still sleepy, the kids grab their

stuff and run into her arms.

She looks at Jackson and softens.

Gordon appears at the door. Jackson watches painfully as Noah

runs and gives Gordon a big hug.

His cellphone beeps with a message.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE/LAS VEGAS - EARLY MORNING

Yuri stands at a huge window overlooking the strip talking

into his phone.

Tamara hovers in the background packing her Louis Vuitton

luggage. Caesar, her little dog, watches from the bed.

Yuri brushes her off.

EXT. STREET/BEL AIR - MORNING

While talking to Yuri, Jackson is standing in front of the

open trunk, changing into his chauffeur suit.

EXT. MANSION/BEL AIR - MORNING

A palatial home. Completely gaudy. The twins, ALEC and OLEG,

wait impatiently. They are 12 years old and wear identical

clothing by Dior.

Jackson ignores him and starts throwing the luggage into the

limo. The other twin notices his muddy sneakers.

EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING

Ahead of the limo a crowd has formed in the streets, singing

songs and chanting about the end of days. A SKINNY MAN with a

ponytail preaches from the scriptures.

Jackson has to maneuver through the people. Banners read:

`Prepare for the End'-- 'You cannot escape his judgement'--

Alec looks up from his video game, annoyed.

Jackson shoots these spoilt brats an angry look.

EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/LOS ANGELES - MORNING

Jackson stops in front of the Gulfstream. SASHA, 40, Yuri's

Russian pilot is expecting them.

Jackson mutters under his breath as he unloads the luggage,

dropping one of them on Alec's foot on purpose.

The other twin has noticed Jackson's intensions. He gets into

his face.

Oleg grins back at Jackson as the jet door closes. The

Gulfstream taxis onto the runway.

As Jackson turns back to the car a fine surface crack shoots

across the tarmac. We hold on his face as it hits him like a

ton of bricks:

THE CRAZY RADIO HOST, CHARLIE FROST WAS RIGHT!

Frantically Jackson looks around and spots a MAN in overalls

working on a twin engine Cessna. He runs to him.

The man points to a shabby office building.

INT. KITCHEN/LOS ANGELES - MORNING

Kate is in her kitchen cooking breakfast for the kids. Gordon

watches the Governor on the news.

The phone rings. Kate picks up.

EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING

Jackson drives like crazy.

Gordon rolls his eyes and mutters.

INT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING

Kate slams the phone down. Lilly stops eating.

On the TV, the interview comes to an end.

That moment a MASSIVE QUAKE hits Los Angeles.

Everybody dives under the table.

ON TV: The news casters and the Governor do the same. A few

seconds later the signal cuts out.

Gordon pulls Kate and the kids close as the earth shakes

violently for 20 seconds.

EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING

Jackson flies into the driveway and runs into the house.

INT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING

When he enters, Lilly immediately runs into his arms. The

next tremor hits. Cracks form on the kitchen floor.

The whole house rides up and down like on a wave.

Finally Kate pushes her son out from under the table. They

all scramble out of the house in a panic. Kate is cut on the

shoulder by falling glass but she hardly notices.

EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING

As they storm out of their front door the house crumbles

behind them.

The whole street starts to buckle. Left and right the houses

are shaken and smashed like toys.

Just before the wave of destruction can reach them, Jackson

tears out of the driveway.

EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING

Jackson maneuver's the limo through the crumbling

neighborhood. Right in front of their eyes, streets

disappear, trees fall, electrical lines snap. Sewer pipes

burst in front of the car.

Jackson has to turn on the windshield wipers.

EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/LOS ANGELES - MORNING

The limo crashes through a gate onto the tarmac, coming to a

stop in front of a twin engine Cessna.

Kate turns to Gordon.

They start running, when Jackson remembers something and

heads back to the Limo.

He grabs his knapsack from the front seat fumbling to zip his

laptop back inside it. Kate shouts.

He jumps out of the car and races back after them. Behind

Jackson the hangar starts to disintegrate.

IN THE DISTANCE

A gigantic fissure forms in the earth, shooting towards Santa

Monica airport.

Gordon fumbles with the controls, Jackson yells from the

copilot seat.

Jackson reaches over and slams Gordon's hand down and the

plane lurches forward.

As the Cessna speeds onto the tarmac the control tower goes

down and explodes.

Noah discovers the giant crevasse forming behind them.

As the plane accelerates, the giant crack closes in on them.

Gordon's hand trembles on the throttle control. Everybody

screams on top of each other.

Gordon gathers his courage and pulls the lever. The plane

almost rockets into the air just as the ground beneath them

gives way.

They hover for a moment, almost caught in mid-air as the

widening crevasse beneath them fights to suck them into the

bowels of the earth. Gordon fights to maintain control but

they begin to be pulled down.

The daylight vanishes. Debris and mud smashes into the plane

from all sides. The canyon walls erupt.

Taking desperate measures, Gordon nearly rips the control

stick out of its joint - with a lurch the Cessna lifts out of

the abyss.

They all take a deep breath only to realize that now they are

flying directly into the collapsing towers of downtown Los

Angeles!

Like a roller coaster, Gordon manages to weave the little

plane through the tumbling high rises.

They dive one last time to evade the plummeting US BANK

TOWER, the tallest building on the west coast.

All are dead silent as they watch the whole of Los Angeles

crumble beneath them. Kate covers Lilly's eyes.

Jackson looks at Kate and notices her cut.

The plane veers off in a northeasterly direction. Behind them

the destruction of Los Angeles continues.

EXT. FREEDOM OF THE SEAS/PACIFIC - DAY

The gigantic cruise ship plows through the Pacific. We hear

lounge music...

INT. BAR/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY

Adrian's father Harry and his partner Tony are on stage.

Harry on the piano, singing, Tony playing the bass. A waiter

brings drinks. Water for Harry, and a brightly colored

cocktail for Tony.

Tony raises his glass to two old ladies who are sitting at

the bar.

The waiter nods. A few more bars of music, then applause.

Applause. Harry rushes off stage.

INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Adrian is standing in a dark corner. Behind him people are

packing up, carrying boxes.

INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY

Harry's face has turned serious.

INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Adrian fights back the tears.

INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY

There's a tremor in Harry's voice.

INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY

A tear runs down Adrian's face.

Pause.

INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY

Harry bites his lip.

INT. BAR/CRUISE SHIP - DAY

Back in the lounge, Tony has finished his cocktail. Harry

walks up and hollers at the barkeeper.

Harry grabs Tony by his shirt.

Harry pulls him even closer.

Harry stares him down.

Harry smiles, downs his bourbon and walks back on stage.

INT. ADRIAN'S OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Adrian enters his office. The TV is on.

Assistants stare at the news in shocked disbelief, some of

them are crying. Prof. West appears at the door.

Prof. West silently nods and beckons Adrian, who follows him

down the hall into a dark control room. They look at a wall-

sized high def monitor.

On the monitors, detailed satellite imagery displays how the

monstrous quake unfolds, leaving California sliding into the

sea.

EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

The base is abandoned but for a few structures and the

enormous drilling tower.

Gordon manages to land the plane next to what looks like a

fueling station. Jackson leaps out checking the pump.

Jackson runs off towards the hills.

Lilly runs after him. Jackson picks her up.

Kate watches as they disappear, worried. Noah and Gordon have

started to fuel the plane.

EXT. CHARLIE'S RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

Jackson and Lilly find Charlie's RV with it's door hanging

open. They enter. The key is in the ignition. The radio

transmitters are on, but Charlie is gone. Jackson fiddles

with the switches and Charlie's voice comes on.

Jackson jumps behind the wheel and turns the ignition.

That catches her interest.

Jackson passes her his mobile phone. Lilly nods. He throws

the RV into gear and they speed off over the bumpy terrain.

In their dust, we see the earth fissuring!

INT. RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

Jackson drives like a bat out of hell.

Jackson tears up the mountain looking for Charlie.

EXT. EMPTY ARMY BASE/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

Kate's phone rings.

INT. RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

Jackson hears the stress in Kate's voice. He hisses at Lilly.

Jackson grimaces.

EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

Kate tries to keep it together for Lilly.

INT. RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

The RV runs over a boulder. Lilly hits the roof.

In the background Kate hears the voice of Charlie Frost.

Lilly spots Charlie way up on a ridge. He has erected his ten

foot radio antenna with the flag fluttering on top.

The road ends just below the mountain peak.

Jackson sees Charlie up above, broadcasting. He hangs up the

phone and jumps out of the RV.

Jackson climbs up to Charlie.

EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

Charlie has his broadcasting equipment strapped to his body.

The antenna's flag is whipping in the wind.

He notices Jackson and muffles the microphone.

All around the landscape begins to collapse. A three mile

crater forms, revealing the awe-inspiring sight of the super-

volcano.

Jackson discovers Lilly standing behind him, staring at

Charlie with her big brown eyes.

Jackson grabs Charlie lifting him off the ground.

A low rumble builds to a rapturous thunder as MILLIONS OF

BIRDS tear into flight.

The mouth of the volcano starts to break apart revealing

molten lava underneath.

Jackson grabs his wide eyed daughter and races down the

mountain.

EXT. BELOW MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

Jackson and Lilly jump into the RV and races off, with

Charlie's broadcast still playing.

Jackson's cell phone rings and he picks up.

EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

In that instant, the air around them vanishes, as if sucked

from the landscape into a vacuum.

THE BIGGEST EXPLOSION THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN... At least in

the last 640,000 years.

To them, all this occurs in total silence. The sound of the

eruption has not reached them yet.

They are frozen, unable to comprehend what is happening.

EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

The explosion begins to resembles an atomic mushroom.

The sound waves reach Charlie, throwing him to the ground.

EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

The RV flies over the rugged terrain. Everywhere the earth is

cracking, falling apart. Jackson struggles to swerve around

the disappearing landscape.

Lilly has discovered the expanding ASH CLOUD behind them.

The THUNDERING sound envelopes them! On the radio, the voice

of Charlie is getting shrill.

EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

Charlie slowly tries to stand again, silhouetted against the

cloud of dust and fire towering above him.

Flaming rocks fly towards him. When they hit the ground, they

detonate like fire bombs.

EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

Rocks plummet like comets around the RV as Jackson races over

a collapsing bridge. On the radio, in his delirious state,

Charlie begins to sing...

Yellowstone looks like a war zone. The RV dodges the

bombardment of fire and rock.

EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

Huge tree trunks and glowing boulders fly at Charlie through

the ashes. He screams at the top of his lungs.

A second later, Charlie's radio antenna comes spinning like a

scythe through the air. It decapitates Charlie in an instant.

EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

The radio cuts out. The forest and the camp grounds are mown

flat by the extreme force of the ASH CLOUD. In the rear view

mirror Jackson sees it gaining on them.

A firebomb hits the RV, ripping half the roof off.

Lilly barely makes it under the dashboard.

Jackson spots the little Cessna in the distance.

EXT. EMPTY ARMY BASE/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

At the entrance to the airstrip a huge crevasse forms,

cutting the RV off from reaching the plane.

Lilly sticks out her head.

Jackson swerves wildly to miss the crack, sending Lilly

flying out. Without thinking, he lets go of the wheel,

lunging after her and pulling her back inside.

Jackson races the RV alongside the forming crack.

Spotting a narrow point in the crevasse, he makes a decision.

Slamming the accelerator down, he races towards it at full

speed.

Moments later the RV is airborne!

Kate watches, too shocked to scream. A few drawn out seconds.

Then the RV touches down, crashing 200 feet from the plane.

Kate runs towards the wreckage of the camper. Lilly jumps

out, racing into her mom's arms. Jackson turns and sees the

cloud approaching.

Kate pulls Lilly back to the plane.

Jackson jumps into the back of the RV scavenging through the

shelves, looking for Charlie's map.

Kate lifts Lilly onto the wing of the plane. Gordon revs up

the engines.

Noah pulls his little sister into the cockpit.

Fiery rocks rain from the sky, detonating to the right and

left of their plane as Kate climbs in.

Gordon pushes the throttle. The plane starts to move. Kate

screams.

Back in the RV, Jackson is frantically going through the

masses of books and papers on the shelves. Finally, a map. He

unfolds it. But it's only of the London underground system.

He throws it to the ground and finds another. This time he's

lucky! There are markings everywhere.

As he races to the door, the ground gives way beneath the RV.

Kate and the kids watch it disappear from sight.

Noah begins to cry and Lilly clings to her mom. Gordon just

stares, paralyzed.

The ASH CLOUD is almost upon them!

Gordon takes action and accelerates the plane.

Kate turns back. A hand emerges from the crevasse. Then

another, holding a map. Her face lights up.

Jackson pulls himself up and sprints towards them, the map in

his hand.

Kate leans out of the cockpit reaching for him.

Using every last ounce of energy, Jackson leaps onto the wing

and is yanked into the plane by Kate.

Just at that moment, the plane lifts off.

Jackson falls into the cockpit, completely out of breath.

Lilly crawls over and hugs him.

Now all eyes are glued to the speedometer. 180... 190...

The violent ASH CLOUD is hitting their tail rudder. The plane

swerves wildly! Gordon gets it back under control.

The speedometer finally creeps towards 200 mph and the CLOUD

slowly falls back. Everybody breathes a sigh of relief.

Jackson unfolds it and takes a look. Hundreds of markings

clutter the map. In the left corner he discovers a large

letter C followed by H - I - N - A.

He looks up.

INT. WEST WING/WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

The White House is being evacuated. Amidst the chaos stands

Anheuser. Adrian puts down a phone and looks at him.

Anheuser starts walking, Adrian trails behind.

INT. OVAL OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Anheuser and Adrian burst into the Anteroom of the Oval

Office. The President's secretary, SALLY, 55, is packing.

Sally looks up stone faced.

Adrian shoots an angry look at Anheuser.

Anheuser walks away. Adrian and Sally exchange a look.

INT. CHAPEL/WHITE HOUSE - SUNSET

Adrian finds the President standing near the front of the

chapel.

President Wilson stays with his head bowed.

He turns to face Adrian.

This quietly affects Adrian.

President Wilson looks Adrian in the eyes.

Adrian takes this in.

Adrian stares at the President in disbelief.

A tense moment before Adrian starts to walk away. Just as he

exits the chapel, Wilson calls after him.

We hold on President Wilson's face.

EXT. LAS VEGAS - SUNSET

Most of Las Vegas is destroyed. A 200 foot wide canyon now

divides sin city along its famous strip. The towering casinos

still teeter along the canyon's rim.

All forms of emergency rescue operations are deployed around

the city.

In the FOREGROUND, we see Las Vegas International Airport,

its runway cut dramatically short. Large pieces of tarmac

continue to break off into the crevasse.

EXT. AIRFIELD/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - SUNSET

Gordon maneuvers his plane through the chaos. Airplanes are

strewn about the runway. Passengers everywhere.

Jackson looks around frantically.

Silence. Noah is right and they know it. They taxi past a

private jet whose front wheel is stuck in a hole in the

tarmac.

We hear a dog barking and the CAMERA finds Tamara, with

Caesar in her arms.

An airport tow truck attempts to pull Yuri's Gulfstream jet

out. Sasha, the pilot, helps. A safety announcement echoes

through the whole area.

Tamara looks scared and secretly reaches for Sasha's hand.

They share an intimate look, no one else sees.

The tow truck driver panics and runs inside.

We move in on Yuri. For the first time he looks helpless.

In the background, Jackson and his family join the panicked

crowd heading towards the terminal building. Firemen and

rescue workers usher them forward.

Jackson and his family are swept along.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE/ARLINGTON AIRPORT - DUSK

Adrian rushes up the stairs of Air Force One, approaching one

of the flight officers.

Adrian moves on.

INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DUSK

Adrian enters. Anheuser immediately senses something is

amiss.

Everyone in the room looks up, speechless.

Adrian is shocked.

Anheuser moves in dangerously close.

Laura quietly enters the Command Center, as Anheuser and

Adrian stare each other down.

Anheuser takes it even further.

Adrian's face is ashen.

Everyone turns to Laura. Silence.

Suddenly, the engines of Air Force One turn over. Laura

panics.

Adrian tries to hold her close to him. Anheuser sees this

intimate moment and gives a suspicious, questioning look. A

second later Laura pushes Adrian away.

Anheuser turns to an officer.

Laura looks at him incredulously.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK

Emergency lights illuminate the densely populated terminal.

One of the rescue workers yells, pushing Jackson and his

family back.

Frustrated, Jackson turns to Kate and Gordon.

Suddenly a voice...

They all turn and stare at Tamara, holding her little dog

against her plump breasts.

Kate gives Gordon a look.

But when Jackson discovers Yuri behind her, his tone suddenly

changes. He gets in Yuri's face.

Sasha comes running in and cuts through this.

Lilly chimes in.

Before Gordon can protest Jackson picks up Lilly.

They burst through the emergency exit, setting off an alarm.

Emergency personnel yell after them.

But they keep on running. Sasha now leads the way.

EXT. AIR FIELD/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK

They race around the corner and come to a halt. Before them,

a Russian freight plane of enormous size--

The ANTONOV 225, the biggest aircraft in the world.

Sasha, who has run ahead turns back and sees:

A MASSIVE GREY WALL OF ASH moving towards the airport.

They all run after him up the stairs.

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK

Sasha enters the cockpit and puts on the headset while

readying the plane for takeoff.

INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DUSK

They all scramble to get into their seats.

They discover the cargo they are carrying--

Sports cars, SUV's, concept cars and luxury models, some of

them are labeled `Las Vegas Auto Show 2012'.

The six engines of the Antonov come roaring to life.

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK

The plane is starting to move. Gordon sits uncomfortably in

the copilot's seat.

Sasha reaches over and does it himself.

Gordon nods and puts on the headset, trying to focus.

INT. TERMINAL/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK

People start SCREAMING, when they discover the menacing WALL

OF ASH racing towards them.

EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK

The nose of the Antonov turns onto the runway. This humongous

plane suddenly looks small against the wall of ash.

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK

Gordon is panicking.

Sasha hits the throttle.

A deafening THUNDER emanates from the engines.

INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DUSK

Everybody grabs their seat as the vibration of the aircraft

builds.

EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK

The Antonov steadily gains speed as it rumbles down the

cracked and uneven runway.

The canyon that has swallowed half the city looms ahead. And

behind them the volcanic cloud bears down.

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK

Sasha stares down the gap ahead, determined. Gordon's face is

as white as a sheet.

INT. TERMINAL/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK

The violent cloud has finally reached the airport. The

terminals are hit by flying debris.

Seconds later, Yuri's Gulfstream is whipped through the air,

shattering the huge windows into a thousand pieces.

People are thrown like rag dolls as the jet explodes in a

massive fireball.

INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DUSK

Kate and Jackson hold their kids tight. Tamara clings to

little Caesar and Yuri to his twins.

EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK

The Antonov lumbers heavily towards the inevitable drop off

on the horizon. The runway is way too short...

And to make matters worse, the ground begins to move again,

slowly arching the tarmac upwards, creating a crooked ramp at

the end of it.

INT. COCKPIT/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK

A drop of sweat trickles down Sasha's forehead as he pulls

back the wheel.

Gordon holds on for dear life as the huge plane barely lifts

off, veering sideways.

EXT. CANYON/LAS VEGAS - DUSK

The Antonov is on a collision course with the crumbling

casino towers along the other side of the rim.

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK

Gordon grabs the wheel on his side, helping Sasha pull up the

beast of a plane.

EXT. CANYON RIM/LAS VEGAS - DUSK

Very slowly the plane starts to rise and Sasha's face lights

up. They barely make it over a casino called `Paris; Las

Vegas'.

But the plane clips its wheels on a high metal structure

right behind it, ripping away part of the landing gear.

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK

After some struggle, Sasha manages to steady the Antonov.

Gordon's face is green as he looks back.

Sasha looks over and grins. He grabs the microphone.

EXT. YAK LA MONASTERY/TIBET - DAY

An ancient monastery built atop a solitary mountain rock. In

the distance, the sun glistens off the peaks of the

Himalayas.

NENG PANG, a young monk, 20, sits with his superior and

teacher LAMA YAK LA, 65. They have tea beneath a huge bronze

bell.

The Lama remains silent.

Instead of answering, the Lama serves him more tea.

When the cup is full, the Lama doesn't stop pouring. Neng

watches the tea overflow until he can no longer restrain

himself.

The Lama stops pouring and looks at Neng.

Neng bows his head in embarrassment.

The Lama smiles to himself and takes a chain from around his

neck. On it hangs a set of rusty car keys.

The Lama throws him the keys and the young monk catches them,

smiling from ear to ear. They bow to each other and Neng runs

off.

Lama Yak La looks after him as a father would. He gets up and

strikes the bronze bell with a wooden mallet.

EXT. HOUSING PROJECT/TIBET - DAY

As far as you can see is a series of identical little houses.

The house in the foreground has a chicken coop in the garden.

Mrs. Pang enters the coop. We last saw her when the village

was being evacuated. She grabs one of the hens. She places

its head on a woodblock and picks up a rusty hatchet.

Just about to strike, she hears a strange RATTLING noise.

An old truck comes driving towards the house. Behind the

wheel sits her son Neng. She puts down the hatchet, yelling.

The young monk jumps out, quickly bowing.

Mrs. Pang is still holding the chicken by its throat.

The chicken hangs limp in Mrs. Pang's hand.

The hen panics as she puts its head back on the block,

raising the hatchet again.

The door opens and Mr. Pang appears.

At that moment the hatchet drops with a THUD!

EXT. ANTONOV/OVER THE PACIFIC - NIGHT

The majestic Antonov is flying high in the Pacific skies.

INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - NIGHT

The boys are exploring the huge freight deck. Caesar, the

little dog, is traipsing along.

Alec, Oleg and Noah marvel at a stylish mixture of luxury and

performance cars.

Noah points to a 2012 Aston Martin parked further back.

The boys share a moment of understanding.

Noah reaches for the door of the Bentley. To his surprise, it

opens.

Noah jumps into the car.

Kate and Lilly are still belted in next to Tamara. Jackson

and Yuri sit on the other side of the Antonov.

Kate looks at Tamara.

They laugh.

Kate looks over at Jackson who's trying to make sense of

Charlie's map. Tamara catches her looking.

Kate lets out a sigh.

On the other side of the plane, Yuri has been watching the

two women talk.

Yuri puts his hand on Jackson's shoulder.

Yuri offers his hand but Jackson doesn't shake it.

Sasha's voice comes over the radio.

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT

Gordon turns to Sasha.

Gordon points to the declining altimeter.

With that, Sasha commences the landing procedure.

EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT

The Antonov dives into a thick layer of clouds.

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT

Gordon shakes his head.

The two pilots stare ahead watching as the clouds slowly

change color, from yellow... to orange.

They stare out the window in disbelief.

INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - NIGHT

Gordon comes climbing down the metal ladder whispering to

Jackson and Yuri.

Jackson and Yuri follow Gordon back into the cockpit. The

women exchange a worried glance.

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT

When Jackson and Yuri enter, they don't believe their eyes.

EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT

From above we watch as the Antonov flies over an endless

ocean of fiery red lava. The Islands of Hawaii have turned

into one big volcano.

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT

Yuri wonders.

EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT

The damaged landing gear slowly retracts into the vast belly

of the Antonov as it veers off to the east.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL CABIN/AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

Adrian knocks quietly and sticks his head around the door.

Laura is sitting in her father's chair.

Adrian enters. He has his travel bag in one hand. He looks at

Laura and gathers himself.

Adrian takes a moment, he's desperate to make her see.

Adrian glances down and spots Jackson's book poking out of

his bag.

Adrian pulls out the book from his bag. He shows her.

Laura takes this in. The plane's intercom cuts through the

moment.

Adrian takes a breath, but before he leaves -

Laura looks at him sadly, but with a little hope.

Adrian moves for the door. He stops.

As Adrian exits, we hold on Laura's conflicted face.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE/WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

The cloud from the Yellowstone eruption has hit Washington

D.C. hard. Pennsylvania Avenue resembles a war zone. A ten

inch layer of ash lies on the ground.

The gates of the White House are wide open, with ash-covered

rescue workers running about, resembling ghosts.

INT. WEST WING/WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

The President has turned the whole West Wing into a shelter.

He walks through the packed rooms assisting where he can.

An old African-American LADY holds a crying young girl.

President Wilson kneels down to her.

The child nods. The President gets up.

As he leaves, the old lady looks up at Sally and smiles.

EXT. FRONT LAWN/WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

The President walks up to the Red Cross tents placed on the

front lawn. He stops one of the Red Cross volunteers.

Without looking up, the young guy responds.

He then recognizes who he's talking to.

The President pats him on the shoulder.

A deep, low rumble begins, stopping everybody in place.

As it builds, the President grabs onto a tent pole to secure

himself. He looks out over Washington D.C. His eyes grow

wide...

The National Mall bends like rubber. The towering Washington

Monument breaks into pieces.

An even more deafening sound makes him turn--

The Capitol Building rises from behind the trees, lifted up

by earth's incredible force.

As the whole building breaks apart, the President is thrown

to the ground.

INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DAY

All the officers and scientists are glued to monitors that

show satellite images from all over the globe. Adrian and

Prof. West stare in disbelief.

Laura enters the command center unnoticed.

She stands there frozen, emotionless. She looks over to

Anheuser, who is shouting orders. Another officer hands him a

phone.

Anheuser takes the phone and after a beat answers.

Adrian and Laura look to each other baffled.

EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE/ROME - DAWN

Pope Benedict XVI holds mass in St. Peter's Basilica.

Millions of followers flood Vatican City. It's a sea of

candles.

Amidst the mass of believers we see the Italian Prime

Minister Antonioni with his family clinging to him. They all

are praying.

A low RUMBLE. People look around frightened. In the distance

we hear SCREAMING.

INT. SISTINE CHAPEL/CEILING - DAWN

A few cardinals huddle together in silent prayer under

Michelangelo's famous fresco. Most prominent above them is

`The Creation of Adam'.

The cardinals look up in horror as the rumbling intensifies.

A crack forms on the ceiling, shooting straight through God

touching the finger of Adam.

Then the whole fresco breaks apart.

EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE/ROME - DAWN

The people in St. Peter's square begin to panic--

The entire Vatican is lifted up in the air. We hold on the

Prime Minister and his family, as the basilica collapses onto

the fleeing masses.

EXT. MOUNT CORCOVADO/RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY

The giant statue of `Christ the Redeemer' on Mount Corcovado.

Behind it, we see Rio de Janeiro being obliterated by violent

quakes.

The famous statue of Jesus Christ begins to topple over and

crashes down the mountain.

EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS/TIBET - NIGHT

Neng Pang, the young Tibetan monk drives his truck up a bumpy

mountain pass. His parents huddle in the back of the pick-up.

The steering wheel is vibrating badly in his hands as he

slides the clutch and downshifts. As the vehicle slows on the

steep incline, the vibrations become much worse. Neng worries

that the truck may be breaking down.

He pulls up and switches off the engine but to his surprise

the steering wheel continues to vibrate.

Looking out the windshield, he sees the whole earth shaking

violently.

Rocks fall all around them.

INT. THE ANTONOV - NIGHT

Jackson sits inside one of the luxury cars and tries the

radio. Kate opens the passenger door and gets in.

Jackson switches off the radio.

Silence. They both look out through the front windshield at

Lilly and Noah curled up together.

He thinks about this and can't help asking.

Kate gets out of the car and shuts the door. He watches her

go.

INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DAY

The computers buzz with the incoming data.

Anheuser looks relieved. Then the big news hits.

Adrian looks distressed as he turns to one of the officers.

Laura notices Adrian's concern.

She grabs Adrian's hand. Anheuser sees this and his

suspicions about them are confirmed. A cold little smile

appears on his face.

INT. SALON/CRUISE SHIP - NIGHT

Tony is watching TV with a group of passengers. Harry has

just entered and stands near the back of the room.

A TEENAGE BOY with bad acne searches for an available channel

that is still broadcasting. He finds a news program with

lousy reception.

The signal gets weaker.

Harry watches Tony slowly stand up. As he turns to his

friend, his knees begin to buckle. His face is pale.

Tony only stares back at him.

Behind them, the TV rolls to the side, as the whole room

begins to tilt.

Harry grabs on to the door frame, as the passengers along

with Tony fall like dominoes.

As the ship rolls to the side, Harry finds himself hanging

from the door frame now 20 feet off the ground. He's barely

able to pull himself up and roll onto the middle deck.

EXT. MIDDLE DECK/CRUISE SHIP - NIGHT

On his back, Harry is shocked to see the star field and the

moon shifting across the sky.

An eerie sound fills the air. A gigantic swell has formed off

to his right. It's a mountain of water.

Harry turns to see another gargantuan swell close in from the

other side of the `Freedom of the Seas'.

EXT. SHIBAM/YEMEN - DAY

The old walled city of Shibam is in ruins. The 2,000-year-old

towers lie on the desert ground. Hundreds of believers have

gathered to pray towards Mecca.

As they raise their hands to heaven in unison, they slow

their motion and the chanting dissipates.

They stare into the distance not knowing if what they see is

reality or only a mirage.

A monstrous tidal wave rises from the desert sands thundering

towards them.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE/WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

President Wilson's body lays between the rubble. As he slowly

regains consciousness, all he can hear is the flapping sound

of the collapsed Red Cross tents.

As President Wilson gets to his feet, he sees--

A tidal wave come sweeping over the remains of the Washington

Mall and it carries with it the battleships of the 14th Fleet

of the US Navy that were anchored in Chesapeake Bay.

The President looks ahead, calm and peaceful.

The CAMERA follows the aircraft carrier `USS John F. Kennedy'

as it slams broadside into the White House.

INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DAY

Hushed voices. Anheuser, Adrian and Prof. West stand amongst

a group of officers and analysts.

Anheuser turns to Adrian.

He nods to one of the analysts, who types in a couple of

commands.

Everybody stares as the graphic illustrates what happened to

planet Earth.

Anheuser looks at the monitor, then turns to Adrian.

Silence. Adrian clears his throat.

An ALARM SIGNAL goes off--

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN

A red light blinks on the plane's instrument panel.

Yuri and Jackson are standing behind the pilots.

Yuri nods and they make their way back to the lower deck.

INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN

Jackson's family are all asleep in their seats, Lilly in her

mom's lap. She looks like a little angel. Jackson can't bear

to wake them. He caresses Lilly's face.

Jackson turns to see Noah is awake.

This breaks Jackson's heart. He pulls Noah tightly to his

chest.

Kate opens her eyes.

Jackson nods.

On the opposite side of the aircraft, Yuri and Tamara help

the twins get into their life vests. Noah is suspicious.

Jackson looks at his kids. They both look scared.

The Antonov jerks to the side. Two more engines out. Alarm

signals flash.

EXT. ANTONOV - DAWN

The remaining two engines barely hold the plane in the air as

it dives into the clouds.

INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN

Jackson and his family huddle together. He puts his arms

around Lilly and Noah.

In the background, Gordon climbs down from the cockpit. He is

about to speak when he hears Jackson's voice.

Jackson glances at Kate.

Jackson looks Kate directly in the eyes.

Gordon watches as Kate pulls the kids and Jackson tight. For

the first time, they seem a little like the family they once

were.

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN

First Jackson and then Yuri enter the cockpit. Sasha points

out of the window.

Behind them Yuri and Jackson stare at the snow covered

mountains of the Himalayas.

Jackson brims with joy.

A JOLT!

The plane drops rapidly, nearly scraping the tip of a

mountain. Sasha and Gordon are doing all they can to keep the

Antonov in the air.

A vast glacier spreads out in front of them.

The plane plummets, loosing altitude fast.

INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN

Jackson and Yuri come running. Yuri yells at his boys.

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN

Sasha is struggling with the gyrating wheel. The glittering

snow field comes flying towards them.

Sasha pulls the Antonov back up.

Gordon yanks with all his might. A loud NOISE.

INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN

The cargo door drops open. The Antonov is extremely close to

the glacier's surface.

Jackson tries to start the Bentley, but nothing happens.

Everyone screams in panic.

They all go quiet, except for a few muffled barks from

Caesar. Yuri speaks towards the dashboard, slowly and

clearly.

The motor revs to life. Yuri looks at Jackson.

INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN

Sasha barely holds on. He yells at Gordon.

Gordon hesitates.

Sasha nods at him reassuringly. Gordon bolts out.

INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN

The cargo door scrapes against the glacier, hurling ice

everywhere. The Bentley roars.

Noah turns and sees Gordon.

Gordon jumps in. Tamara yells at him in desperation.

Yuri notices Tamara's distress as she keeps looking back to

the cockpit. Jackson slams the pedal down trying to gain as

much speed as possible to soften their landing.

The Bentley shoots out the back of the plane. As it hits the

snow, the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers.

The Antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury

cars out of the back cargo hold. They barrel past the Bentley

like skittles, narrowly missing it as they fly off in

opposite directions.

The plane skids across the glacier, clipping its wing and

causing the aircraft to break apart.

Sasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he

shoots towards the ledge in the Antonov, plunging into the

deep.

The plane crashes and explodes.

EXT. GLACIER/TIBET - DAWN

As the snow settles we see that the glacier is scattered with

luxury cars tomb-stoned in the snow.

The Bentley is half buried. We hear Caesar barking.

The door opens and Jackson climbs out, looking around. Just

above the wind, he hears the SOUND OF HELICOPTER BLADES.

One by one the others appear behind Jackson and stare at a

surreal sight--

Several Chinese Mil-26 choppers airlift animals over the

mountain pass.

GIRAFFES, ZEBRAS, EVEN ELEPHANTS hang by huge straps from

these flying machines.

One of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet

and lands near the Bentley.

Armed soldiers jump out. Their Commander speaks to them in a

sharp tone.

Jackson nods to them.

The others acknowledge the soldiers as well. Hi... Hello...

Jackson stands dumbfounded. The Commander repeats.

Still no answer. He yells an order. The soldiers point their

guns at them.

Surprised, Jackson turns to Yuri who's holding up three green

plastic cards.

Tamara can't believe what she's hearing.

Yuri shrugs. Tamara lunges at him.

Yuri brushes her off, coldly. And then speaks so they can all

understand him.

With that Yuri turns to the others.

The twins grab Caesar and climb into the helicopter. The dog

barks furiously, wanting to stay with Tamara.

The next moment, the helicopter takes off.

They're stranded.

EXT. AIRFIELD IN CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN

Air Force One is in the background as Laura, Anheuser, and

other members of the crew are rushed towards a group of

waiting helicopters.

Adrian is a little way back in the middle of the pack. A

Chinese Officer with a list shouts over the noise.

Laura and Anheuser reach the chopper. An authoritative Naval

Officer greets them, and raises his voice.

Anheuser nods and climbs in the chopper. Captain Michaels

helps Laura in. Adrian arrives just as the Chopper door

slides shut and it lifts off.

INT. HELICOPTER/CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN

Laura catches Adrian's look of unease before they soar away.

Laura's look thanks him for this. He turns to Anheuser.

Captain Michaels looks up and points into the distance.

EXT. CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN

The CAMERA follows the choppers revealing--

Nine gigantic oval gates that measure at least 60 stories,

built into the face of a mountain.

In front of every gate there is a line of huge `Y' shaped

metal support structures, which are the launching towers for

the ships. They are each at least 800 feet high. It's an

unparalleled feat of engineering.

EXT. CHOPPER/CHO MING VALLEY - DAWN

The lead chopper descends onto a platform in front of one of

the gates, dwarfed against this majestic setting.

The door slides open and Anheuser jumps out. Laura follows.

She looks around in awe.

Even the utility entrances that lead into the mountain are

immense. The Captain guides them into the hollow mountain.

In the BACKGROUND we see an angry Yuri scream and argue with

military personnel, waving his tickets.

The twins stand nearby, holding Caesar. They look afraid.

EXT. THE GLACIER/CHO MING - DAWN

Jackson and his group are small specks in a barren landscape.

They have made it down the glacier and are now walking over a

scree field.

It is hard going. Jackson carries Lilly.

Kate holds Noah by the hand. Gordon and Tamara trail behind.

She's still very upset.

Tamara nods silently.

Suddenly they hear the PUTTERING of an engine.

In the distance, an old rusty truck comes bumping down the

dirt road. Jackson puts down Lilly and chases after it.

EXT. DIRT ROAD/NEAR CHO MING - DAWN

Neng and his parents drive past, billowing a huge cloud of

dust just as Jackson reaches the road.

But Neng doesn't hear him over the rattling truck. Jackson,

pissed, kicks at the rocks on the road.

Just then, Neng's mother, sitting in the back of the truck,

turns and sees his tantrum. She bangs on the rear window of

the cabin.

Neng looks in the mirror and hits the brakes. Jackson can't

believe his luck.

The others show up and they all run towards the truck.

INT. INSIDE MOUNTAIN/CHO MING - DAWN

Anheuser and Laura follow Captain Michaels and a Chinese

Steward over one of the many boarding bridges erected inside

the cavernous mountain that lead to one of the monstrous

arks. Laura stops halfway, gazing in awe--

Deep down below, thousands of workers are swarming over the

ship, readying it for launch.

Laura looks up and sees the contrast, spotting the SHEIK we

met in the Dorchester Hotel as he boards comfortably with his

huge family.

Laura points down at the workers.

The Captain doesn't know what to say. Anheuser turns.

Laura hates him in that moment.

Anheuser and Captain Michaels move away as Laura stands and

watches the frantic workers who are now boarding the animals

we saw being airlifted over the mountains.

Laura has a look of guilt as she follows the steward.

EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE

Thousands are on the march up the mountains. Behind them a

valley stretches into the horizon. Plumes of smoke rise from

destroyed cities in the distance.

Amongst the refugees, we discover Satnam, the young

astrophysicist, holding his little son. The rest of Satnam's

family trails behind.

Distant WARNING SIRENS pierce the silent march, coming from

the cities below.

People start to scream and run, but Satnam stands there

frozen. He fumbles for his satellite phone, then hits a

number on its speed dial.

INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE

Adrian is unpacking. He lays down his copy of `Farewell

Atlantis' just as his cell phone rings.

Adrian's face goes pale.

Adrian closes his eyes.

EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE

Satnam swallows hard. He stares out into the valley.

A wall of undulating foam and debris comes rolling towards

him. A tidal wave of gigantic height.

Everybody panics and scratches for a higher elevation. But

for Satnam it is clear, they do not stand a chance.

He picks up his little son, squeezing him tightly to his

chest, humming an Indian lullaby for the scared child.

INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE

Adrian hears SCREAMING on the phone and the deafening sound

of the approaching wave. He tenses up, desperate but unable

to do anything.

As the noise reaches its height, the line goes dead. Adrian

is left breathless.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE

Adrian storms onto the bridge. Many officers and analysts are

at work under Captain Michaels.

Anheuser and Prof. West step over and join him.

They all stare at the monitor showing several tidal waves

coming in from the south.

A science officer selects a different quadrant on the

satellite display. They all stare at the new tidal wave

that's coming from the East of the Cho Ming valley.

Anheuser is shocked.

As the officer does this, Prof. West looks at Adrian with

questioning eyes.

Prof. West is horrified.

Adrian turns back to the monitor and sees the new tidal wave

that is coming towards the Cho Ming valley.

Every one on the bridge stares at a display. It reads--

02hrs - 09min - 07sec

The science officer nervously hits a few keys and the display

changes to--

00hrs - 28min - 10sec... and counting.

We see the shock on Anheuser's face.

EXT. GATE/CHO MING SITE - EARLY MORNING

Neng's truck, loaded with Jackson and the others, creeps up

to the service entrance of the launch site.

A lone figure awaits them. This is Neng's older brother Lin,

who we saw signing up for the 'Chinese Dam Project'.

Lin notices the strangers in the pick-up truck.

Neng answers hesitantly.

The others watch the interaction but do not understand.

Jackson senses a problem. He grabs Lilly and Noah.

Gordon and Tamara stare perplexed as Jackson approaches Lin

with his kids.

Lin answers in broken English.

Lin stares at him stone faced. In desperation, Kate turns to

Mrs. Pang.

Silence. A beat. The old Chinese lady turns to Lin.

She looks up at her son, determined.

Mr. Pang nods and reluctantly, Lin motions to Jackson to

follow. Kate bows to Mrs. Pang.

Jackson and the others acknowledge what Kate has done.

INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING

We finally reveal the unbelievable magnitude of this ship

yard, built into the hollow belly of the mountains.

Nine gargantuan vessels are lined up next to each other.

Their size is at least four times that of the `Freedom of the

Seas'. However, they look more like spaceships than anything,

having been built aerodynamically to withstand the full force

of nature.

But only three of these monstrous ARKS are complete. Number 4

is being repaired, all the others are still under

construction, surrounded by scaffolding.

Suddenly SIRENS goes off!

The boarding bridges to the finished vessels begin to

retract. There's growing confusion among the thousands of

workers and security personnel.

INT. PLATFORM, SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING

Opposite the boarding bridges, on a large platform, Yuri and

his boys sit in line with the other waiting passengers.

They watch as massive stern gates begin to close. Yuri jumps

up and yells to the others.

The soldier from earlier points his gun at him.

Caesar barks at the guy.

The soldier turns to the ships and Yuri knocks him out. He

grabs his boys and runs towards the closing gates. All the

other passengers surge forward with him.

In the distance, on the bow side of the ships, the huge

mountain gates of the bay open, revealing a stunning view of

Cho Ming Valley.

EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE/CHO MING - MORNING

Lin leads his group over a ridge. In front of their eyes--

The gates to the mountain open!

They follow Lin rushing down the hill, towards one of the

many Y-shaped launch structures towering in front of the

gates. Neng and Kate help Mr. and Mrs. Pang down the rocky

terrain.

INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - MORNING

A screeching and thundering noise!

THE THREE COMPLETED VESSELS BEGIN TO INCH FORWARD on metal

girders connecting the Y-shaped launch towers.

INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING

Laura feels a jolt. She rushes out of her small cabin and

into a swarm of people moving down a crammed endless

corridor. She struggles to fight her way through.

A digital voice blares over the speakers.

Laura bumps into one of Adrian's Science Officers.

EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - MORNING

The three gigantic vessels emerge from the mountain, into the

open. Support helicopters swarm around them like flies.

EXT. BENEATH A LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO-MING - MORNING

Lin and his group look like ants as they scale the metal

ladders of one of the launch towers.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING

Verbal commands fly back and forth. Anheuser watches the

preparations from a large window.

He looks over to the command bridges of the other vessels as

they continue to be pulled into place.

INT. COMMAND BRIDGES/OTHER SHIPS - MORNING

We cut to the various Heads of State, all at their command

posts.

EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING

A hatch opens at the top of the launch tower. Lin is the

first to climb out.

Right before his eyes, the hull of the American Ship slowly

creeps towards him. He's but a speck against this man-made

behemoth.

Lin hastily pulls the others up.

It's a race against time. The huge ship's hull closes in

fast. Lin and his family crawl up the side arm while Jackson

hurries to pull up the rest of the group.

Lilly freezes at the sight of the approaching ship.

Jackson rips her out of harm's way, just in time. In a

frenzy, he pushes her up the support arm where the others are

already huddled on a small platform.

As the towering wall of steel passes by them, inches from

their faces, Mr. Pang loses his balance. Jackson and Lin both

see this, but Jackson is closer--

He grabs the old man by his arm, saving him from falling to

his death.

For the first time, Lin acknowledges Jackson with a nod.

EXT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING SITE - MORNING

The three completed ships are half way out, grinding to their

final launching position.

A mob of passengers led by Yuri has fought their way to the

ship. More and more people join them, including soldiers.

EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING

Lin, Jackson and the group are huddled on the platform.

The sound of SCREAMING PEOPLE makes them turn. The storming

masses have arrived at the access platform. There is now a

huge drop off between them and the tails of the ships.

Next to Yuri are his twins, holding Caesar. She yells!

EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING

The little dog hears Tamara and jumps out of Oleg's arms,

leaping onto one of the thick cables, that connects the

platform with the launching towers.

Alec and Oleg attempt to run after Caesar, but Yuri grabs

them by their necks.

He's panicked. The arriving masses are pushing them to the

drop off at the edge of the platform.

EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING

The ship has reached its targeted position. A small hatch

lines up directly in front of Lin and his group.

One by one they all climb into the hatch. Jackson being the

last in, notices that Tamara has stayed back.

She doesn't move, anxiously waiting for her beloved dog

darting towards her.

EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING

The mob pushes at Yuri and his boys. Passengers on either

side tumble off the platform.

Yuri watches one of them fall, hitting his head against a

tiny ledge 8 feet below. To his right, he sees a small ladder

leading down.

As they hurry down the ladder, people keep tumbling into the

deep. Reaching the ledge, Oleg discovers Caesar running

towards Tamara.

Yuri cannot believe his eyes.

EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING SITE - MORNING

The hatch behind Tamara begins to move. The hydraulic

supports are being lifted, sealing up the vessel.

Jackson reaches out from the closing hatch.

Tamara climbs inside the hatch and turns.

Caesar leaps into her arms only seconds before the hatch

seals. As a last gesture, Tamara sticks out her arm and gives

Yuri the finger.

INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING

Lin leads the group into a long and narrow chamber where the

hydraulics for the tail gate are located.

He opens a tool cabinet, retrieving a giant electrical power

drill, almost too big to be carried by one person.

Lin climbs to a hatch near the ceiling and begins to unscrew

the huge bolts. He looks at Jackson.

INT. TECHNICAL COMMAND CENTER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Laura and the Science Officer enter the Technical Command

Center. She finds Adrian staring at a wall of monitors

showing the horrifying scenario on the platforms.

People are falling to their deaths in large numbers in their

desperation to board the ship.

Outside, panicking workers, screaming for their life!

Deserted passengers waving their green cards!

Adrian makes a decision and rushes out.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Anheuser turns hearing Adrian storming onto the bridge.

With that, Adrian turns to the Communication Officer.

The officer hesitates as Laura enters in the background.

Bobby flicks a switch. Adrian's voice echoes through all the

ships.

INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY

The German Chancellor turns to one of the technicians on the

bridge of the European Ship.

Next to her stand the British and French Prime Ministers.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Anheuser looks on stoney faced.

Laura watches him proudly.

Anheuser cuts in with sarcasm.

The Communications Officer looks at Adrian.

INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY

The Russian President, together with the heads of state from

China and Japan, listen in as Adrian responds.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Anheuser has had enough.

He's almost screaming now.

Silence.

Adrian's battle seems lost. But he doesn't give up, and

instead speaks softly now.

All eyes are glued to Adrian.

Adrian stares Anheuser in the eyes as he continues.

Silence. Laura steps up alongside Adrian.

Adrian and Laura share a look.

INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY

His Asian colleagues nod in approval.

INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY

The German Chancellor speaks up.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Laura and Adrian watch Anheuser shaking his head in defeat.

Bobby, the Communications Officer smiles with relief. Adrian

turns to the Captain.

EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY

One by one the gigantic gates at the stern of the three ships

begin to creek open.

The masses gathered on the platform CHEER wildly!

INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Lilly crawls through the CONNECTING TUNNEL meeting up with

Kate in a large bay on the other side.

Together with Neng and his parents, they all look up in

DISBELIEF--

A Giraffe, chewing her cud, smiles down at them. Caesar barks

at her.

A second later, hundreds of different ANIMALS RESPOND. They

are in the zoological bay.

INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Gordon helps Noah up the small ladder leading to the

connecting tunnel.

Just as he goes to hand him Jackson's backpack, the HYDRAULIC

MOTORS begin to GROWL! Lin looks up in panic. He screams.

The whole ceiling begins to lower towards them. From down

below, Jackson sees his son about to be hit by it.

Gordon makes a split second decision. With all his strength,

he shoves the boy into the tunnel.

INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

From the other side of the tunnel, Kate watches as the metal

ceiling misses Noah by a hair, but catches Gordon, wiping him

off the ladder.

INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Jackson watches helplessly as Gordon falls past him. He

survives his landing and desperately tries to grab on to the

sloping surface, but he can't. He slips.

Gordon is crushed between the gears, sharing his last look

with Jackson before he dies.

INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Kate helps a trembling Noah out of the tunnel.

Kate pulls him close and shuts her eyes tightly. She fights

back the tears.

INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Jackson and Lin know they're running out of time, their

remaining space is shrinking every second.

Lin grabs the huge electrical power drill nearby and attempts

to jam it between the hydraulic arm and the wall.

As it digs deeper into the metal, the hydraulic starts to

slow down.

EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING - DAY

Still on the ledge, Yuri and the boys watch as the huge

boarding gate lowers towards them. They are trapped.

Just then, the gates begin to slow, but surely they will be

crushed.

INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Back in the chamber, Lin still struggles with the drill.

Suddenly he slips.

Jackson manages to catch his fall. But in the process Lin's

foot gets caught between the gears, mangling it.

He screams in pain as the hydraulic slowly grinds towards a

halt.

In great pain, Lin grins back at him.

EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY

The gates of the ships hit the access platform with a

thundering noise. People begin to rush on board.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Alarm signals go off. The Captain turns to one of his

officers.

The countdown on the monitor reads 2 min. 40 sec. Laura and

Adrian share a worried look.

We hear a HOLLOW BELL ring!

EXT. YAK LA MONASTERY/TIBET - DAY

Lama Yak La rings the large bronze bell of his monastery.

The booming sound echoes through the Cho Ming valley. As a

gentle wind catches the Lama's clothes, he looks up--

A tidal wave of immeasurable proportion crests the mountains.

The Lama continues to strike the bell as the monastery is

wiped clean from the earth.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

The technicians desperately try to figure out what's wrong.

An officer waves Adrian over.

The video camera moves in on Kate, Noah and Lilly. Adrian

can't believe his eyes. He turns to Laura.

Captain Michaels shouts across the room.

Anheuser looks nervously at the countdown. It reads 1:34

EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - DAY

Above Yuri and the boys, people are leaping from the access

platform onto the stern gate of the American ship.

Yuri looks for a hole in the flow of people before seizing

his chance and lifting the first of his boys up.

Oleg manages to reach up and hold onto the gate.

Inside the ship, officers yell.

The gates suddenly screech back into life and begin to close.

Yuri doubles his efforts lifting Alec higher, but Alec cannot

quite reach.

Yuri strains with all his effort before deciding.

Yuri leaps forward holding Alec out in his arms.

Oleg manages to grab his brother's hands as Yuri lets go and

falls into the deep crevasse below. He makes no noise until

he hits the rocks beneath.

Oleg pulls his brother from above.

INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

A SIREN blasts. Both of Yuri's sons are now on deck. A

loading officer pulls them back, away from the gate.

The loading officer attempts to comfort them.

The Officer and the boys look back as the stern gate slowly

closes. But with a SCREECHING sound it grinds to a halt.

The gate is jammed open leaving a twenty foot gap.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

ALARMS sound. Anheuser and the Captain stare at the monitors.

They race over. Adrian points to a monitor.

On the monitor, they see Sarah and the others desperately

waiting for Jackson and Lin.

Bobby, the Surveillance Officer, selects a different camera

and we now see inside the tunnel in which Jackson is pulling

along a wounded Lin.

Adrian tries to ignore this.

Anheuser sneers him, shooting a look to Laura.

Without thinking, Adrian turns and punches Anheuser hard in

the face. He drops to the floor, out cold.

Everyone stands in stunned silence. Laura smiles. Adrian

looks around.

They speed off. The countdown reads 0 min. 53 sec.

EXT. AIRFIELD/TIBET - DAY

Further down in the valley, the tidal wave has reached the

Cho Ming airfield, blasting away the planes with overwhelming

force.

EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY

The massive propellers of the ships begin to turn. However,

the props of the American ship don't move.

In the background, the huge tidal wave comes thundering

towards them.

INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

An IMPACT WARNING sounds as Adrian and Laura race through the

crammed hallways with members of the rescue crew. One of the

officers explains.

INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Kate, Noah and Lilly watch as Jackson nears the end of the

tunnel with Lin. Neng comforts his brother who's about to

pass out.

EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY

THE WAVE FINALLY HITS!

All three vessels are now engulfed in churning water.

They rock back and forth. Only the huge support towers

they're resting on, keep them anchored.

INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

A new ALARM sounds as water begins to shoot through the open

stern gate of the American ship.

The people on the loading bay panic, among them we see Alec

and Oleg.

INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

The same ALARM rings out in the hallways of the ship. Laura,

Adrian and their party are all braced against the corridor,

as the vessel undulates back and forth.

Laura looks unsure.

Adrian looks at him.

Despite the violent movement of the ship, Adrian pushes on

down the corridor towards the back of the boat. They follow.

INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Water is also now rushing into the Zoological Bay and only

the giraffe can manage to keep her head dry.

Jackson is not yet out of the tunnel with an unconscious Lin.

Kate shouts across to Tamara.

Kate reaches in to help Jackson as Tamara begins to move with

Lilly. Noah remains back with his mother.

Jackson finally makes it through with Lin. Kate is almost

tearful with relief to see him.

Suddenly the Zoological bay begins to seal itself off.

Lilly, already in the next compartment with Tamara and her

dog, screams out as a chamber door quickly slides up, from

the floor to the ceiling. It separates Lilly from her family.

Jackson and Kate turn but it's too late. They only catch a

glimpse of Lilly before they are sealed in. The water level

continues to rise.

INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Panicked, Tamara turns and looks around. Down the corridor,

in the distance, she sees Adrian, Laura and the rescue crew

approaching.

But between them she spots the next chamber door rising

quickly.

Lilly starts moving as Tamara turns and picks up Caesar.

Moving quickly, Lilly is able to climb up and over the fast

rising door. But as she dangles from the other side, she

looks down and is too scared to jump.

Lilly looks up and sees two hands straining to hold Caesar

above the quickly narrowing gap.

In a courageous move, Lilly grabs the little dog before he

gets crushed and together they fall to the ground.

Back on the other side of the chamber door, Tamara looks

around. She is trapped now as the water continues to rush in.

INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY

Laura picks Lilly up and comforts her. Adrian realizes they

are too late. He turns to the rescue crew.

Lilly is close to tears.

INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

The water continues to flood in as Jackson helps Neng with

his unconscious brother.

Suddenly, a VIOLENT SHAKE throws them all off balance,

pitching them into the water.

EXT. LAUNCH PILLAR/UNDER WATER - DAY

In the debris-filled, murky waters we see that the fuselage

of Air Force One has slammed against the first of the ship's

launch towers.

Slowly it begins to bend, finally giving way. The other

launch towers follow like dominos.

The ship is ripped from its anchorage and sent drifting

sideways, rudderless.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Chaos. Fear. Everybody holds on for dear life.

EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY

The vessel is swept away, over the mountain ridge.

INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Alec and Oleg scream, desperately trying to hold on as the

whole ship capsizes.

EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYA - DAY

The giant ship drifts upside down and rudderless - smashed

around by the debris and raging waters.

But then, as it hits another ridge, it rolls right side up

and seems to steady itself.

However, the strong currents continue to force it through the

mountain ranges of the Himalayas.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

The officers try to regain some control.

The Captain's face drops.

INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

The water rises fast as Kate sees the severity of Lin's wound

for the first time.

A split second later Noah holds out his belt.

Suddenly Jackson hears a voice over a speaker.

Kate screams with relief.

INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY

Adrian is using an emergency wall intercom, with Laura next

to him, holding Lilly.

Caesar barks.

INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Tamara hears Caesar over the speaker in her compartment and

smiles with relief. She is struggling to stay afloat though,

and is running out of air.

INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Jackson discovers the wall speaker. He moves closer to it.

INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY

All eyes are on Adrian as he speaks.

Adrian looks at Laura.

INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Jackson looks at Kate.

The water is up to their chest now. Jackson takes a breath

and disappears underwater.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Back on the bridge, Anheuser regains consciousness and gets

to his feet. His nose is bleeding. He looks around him.

The Captain looks at him annoyed.

Anheuser looks at him dumbfounded as he stumbles to the

window and sees the massive rock face of Mount Everest in the

distance.

INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Jackson swims down into the dark chamber and reaches the

jammed power tool, pulling at it. But it doesn't budge.

INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

The water level in Tamara's compartment is at its height now

and she goes under.

She struggles below the surface for a moment, looking around

desperately for a way out but there is none.

Tamara drowns.

INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Jackson manages to find an air pocket. He fills up his lungs

with air and thinks hard.

As he strips off his jacket, he seems to have a plan. He

dives under again.

INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Lin is being held up in the water by his brother and parents.

Kate has wrapped the belt around his lower leg and now pulls

it tight. Lin screams.

Noah uses this as the moment to dive underwater, unnoticed,

to go and help his father.

INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Back under water, Jackson is using the extension cord of the

power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet.

Jackson opens it, retrieving a giant crowbar. He begins to

use it to dislodge the tool but it's hard work.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Anheuser and everybody on the bridge stares as the north face

of Mount Everest is almost upon them.

INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Kate and the Pangs are desperately close to running out of

air now, but despite this, Kate still tends to Lin.

After a moment she turns and is first confused then horrified

to see that Noah is nowhere to be found.

INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Jackson pulls with all his might, but he can't quite shift

the drill.

To his surprise, a pair of young hands join his on the handle

of the crowbar. Noah is alongside him now, helping.

Working as father and son, they manage, little by little, to

loosen it before finally the drill comes free.

Adrian gives Noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the

surface. Jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he

spots the knapsack containing his laptop.

He dives back down for it.

INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Noah emerges from the water.

Kate pulls him to her, relieved he is safe. Noah smiles and

calls out towards the nearly submerged speaker.

INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY

Lilly and Laura wait nervously. They hear a muffled voice.

Adrian leaps up when he hears this. He flicks a button on the

intercom.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Hearing this, the Captain yells the eagerly awaited order.

EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYAS - DAY

We hear a BOOMING sound as the tail gate finally seals.

INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Jackson reaches his knapsack, but when sees Noah's cell phone

lying next to it, he makes a decision and reaches for that

instead.

He hears the muffled sound of the engines and smiles. But as

he turns to swim back, his face freezes--

He's looking into the lifeless eyes of Gordon, who floats

inches from his face.

EXT. PROPELLERS/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

The gigantic propellers fight against the current, hitting

rock at the base of the mountain.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

The battle seems hopeless. Captain Michaels yells at the top

of his lungs.

The vessel scrapes against the rocks, throwing Anheuser to

the floor.

EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYA - DAY

The giant ship escapes the mountain with an inch to spare.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Everyone on the bridge watches in awe as Mount Everest,

earth's highest peak, drifts slowly past.

After a long beat, they begin to holler and cheer.

INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Kate hears the CHEERING coming from the speakers. The water

level stops rising but she still looks around in panic.

Noah begins to cry.

Finally! Jackson bursts out of the water and takes a lungfull

of wonderful air.

Kate and Noah are overjoyed. The Pangs smile to one another.

Jackson looks Kate squarely in the eyes.

Kate embraces him tightly.

Noah is all smiles.

We hear a voice.

The CAMERA moves over the last lines of Jackson's novel.

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Adrian sits in his cabin, his copy of `Farewell Atlantis' in

his lap.

Opposite him, Laura sits listening to him read.

Adrian closes the book. There's a moment of silence.

Laura looks at him grinning.

The intimate moment is cut short.

INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Adrian and Laura make their way to the bridge.

INT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Jackson and his family stand amongst thousands of other

people who are gathering in anticipation.

Jackson kneels down and zips up Lilly's jacket. She is

holding Caesar, whose still wearing his diamond collar.

Jackson squeezes Lilly's shoulder.

Lilly turns to see Yuri's boys standing next to her.

The boys both smile at her.

INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Adrian and Laura enter the bridge.

The Captain directs him to a monitor.

The Captain grins at Prof. West.

A monitor reveals an image of the African continent, however

its shape changed dramatically. The image of the southern tip

is enlarged.

Captain Michaels hands Adrian a short wave radio.

Adrian curious, grabs the mic.

We hear a muffled, raspy voice through the speakers.

INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY

Harry Helmsley stands beside the cruise ship's Captain.

INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Adrian is ecstatic. Captain Michaels explains.

INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY

Harry looks over at Tony who's listening, smiling.

Harry hangs up. He picks up Tony, embracing him wildly.

INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Adrian, still excited from speaking with his dad, grabs Laura

and kisses her on the lips. She squeals.

Adrian looks at Anheuser, unsure of what he might say.

Adrian and Laura exchange a look.

Adrian nods and with a smile to Laura turns to leave.

Adrian turns back.

Anheuser puts out his hand. Adrian takes it.

INT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

Neng pushes his brother Lin in a wheelchair onto the deck

next to his parents. Mrs. Pang turns to her husband.

The old Chinese man forces a little smile. Closer to the

front of this crowd Jackson approaches Noah.

He takes Noah's cell phone from his pocket and hands it to

him.

Jackson is touched to hear him use that word. He smiles and

hugs him. Adrian, Laura and Anheuser arrive alongside them.

Jackson looks at her, smiling playfully.

Adrian smiles.

Suddenly a horn sounds and the sealed deck doors let off a

burst of pressurised air. A murmur goes through the crowd.

Everyone is silent as the huge deck doors slowly begin to

roll back and light streams in.

The Pang family try to see over people's heads, even Anheuser

looks hopeful. Jackson pulls his family close as the first

rays of daylight hit their faces.

EXT. AMERICAN SHIP/SOMEWHERE IN THE HIMALAYAS - DAY

Hatches unseal all around the ship. Sun streams through the

clouds. Everywhere people emerge outside, into the light of

day. A majestic moment.

EXT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

They all stare in awe at the waters receding against the ice-

covered mountain peaks. Caesar lets out a YELP of joy.

Almost as soon as the doors have opened, the ship's

HELICOPTERS take off, flying towards a stunning site--

The `Freedom of the Seas' is perched on a mountain peak,

surrounded by calm waters. Behind it, they see the most

beautiful rainbow. This is the new world.

And again we hear Mozart's Adagio...
