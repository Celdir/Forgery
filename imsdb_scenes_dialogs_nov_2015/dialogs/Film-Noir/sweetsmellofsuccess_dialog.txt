J.J. HUNSECKER

"They eyes of Broadway"

IGGY

Aw Lady, if I looked like you, I'd--

SIDNEY

C'mon...C'mon...

IGGY

(recognizing Sidney's voice)

Keep ya sweatshirt on, Sidney.

IGGY

Hey, Fresh, the Globe just came

in -- Hey, Sidney, want an item for

Hunsecker's column?  Two rolls get

fresh with a baker!  Hey, hot, hot,

hot -- etc.

SALLY

Just a minute, Mr. Weldon.  I

think...

SALLY

(to phone)

I'm sorry.  I thought that was Mr.

Falco returning.  Yes, I'll tell

him when he comes in.  I know he's

been trying to reach you.

SALLY

That's the third time he's called

today.

SIDNEY

He wants me to break a leg?

SALLY

(literally)

No, an arm, he said.

(then)

I told him you were sure the item

would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column

in tomorrow's...

SIDNEY

(interrupting, sharply)

It isn't.  I've just seen the early

edition.

SALLY

But...

SIDNEY

But what?

SALLY

That makes five days in a row that

Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his

column.

SIDNEY

May I rent you out as an adding

machine.

SIDNEY

Get me Joe Robard.

SIDNEY

Who else phoned?

SALLY

The renting agent and the tailor.

SIDNEY

Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.

SALLY

It won't leave much of a balance in

the bank...

(to phone)

Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?

SIDNEY

(gloomily)

Watch me run a fifty yard dash with

my legs cut off!

SIDNEY

(effusively)

Sidney, Joe.  How do you like it?

I'm running out of alibis!  No, I

asked Hunsecker to withhold the

item, until he could give it a

fine, fat paragraph.  The column

was running over and I didn't want

you kissed off with just a line...

ROBARD

(in answer to Sidney)

Of course.

(he listens to

protest from Sidney)

What is this, Sidney, a kissing

game?  You're a liar - that's a

publicity man's nature.  I wouldn't

hire you if you wasn't a liar.  I

pay you a C-and-a-half a week

wherein you plant big lies about me

and the Club all over the map.

(a pause)

Yeah, I mean in that sense.  But

also in the sense that you are a

personal liar, too, because you

don't do the work I pay you for.

(new protests on the

other end of the line)

Oh, stop it, Sidney.  You're from

the country, not me.

SIDNEY

(to phone)

Now, wait a minute, Joe.  When I

saw J.J. last night he said...

SALLY

I wish I could help in some way,

Sidney.

SIDNEY

(aggressively)

Help me with two minutes of silence!

SIDNEY

Go home, Sally.  It's late...

SALLY

I hate to see you like this --

SIDNEY

(horsing around)

Yes, but as a new subscriber you're

under no obligation to take more

than three books.  And if you mail

the enclosed card within ten days --

SALLY

(pleadingly)

Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't

do a dance with me...

SIDNEY

(still clowning)

You mean you don't want the extra

free gift of a colorful giant map

of the world???

SALLY

(distressed)

Sidney, please, dear, if you feel

nervous...

SIDNEY

(with cruelty)

So what'll you do if I feel nervous?

You'll open your meaty, sympathetic

arms...?

SALLY

(breaking down)

Sid...you got me so...I don't know

what...

SIDNEY

You ought to be used to me by now.

SALLY

(pathetically)

I'm used to you...

SIDNEY

(with a touch of bitterness)

No.  You think I'm a hero.  I'm no

hero.  I'm nice to people where it

pays me to be.  I gotta do it too

much on the outside, so don't

expect me to kow-tow in my own

office.  I'm in a bind right now

with Hunsecker so --

(grimly)

Every dog has his day!

(going)

Lock up and leave the key.

SIDNEY

If that's for me, tear it up!

SALLY

Take a top coat.

SIDNEY

And leave a tip in every hat-check

room in town?

SALLY

Sidney Falco office... Oh, Miss

Kay, he tried to reach you.  No,

he's at the barbers now.  No,

that's held over till the Tuesday

column...

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

RITA

Don't you ever get messages,

Eyelashes?  I called you twice.

SIDNEY

(irked)

I've been up to here.  Listen,

honey, tell me something.  You know

Susan Hunsecker...?

(Rita nods)

Has she been in?  I mean lately, in

the last coupla days...?

RITA

I don't think so.

SIDNEY

You're sure.  Find out for me.

RITA

(with a nod)

Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?

SIDNEY

Is Frank D'Angelo around?

RITA

At the bar - Sidney...

D'ANGELO

(to the bartender)

Joe, give my nephew a drink.

SIDNEY

(sullen)

Your nephew doesn't want a drink.

D'ANGELO

That's a lollipop that, boy.  The

kid is only great.

SIDNEY

And with ten percent of his future,

you're great, too, Frank.

D'ANGELO

Went over to Philly yesterday an'

seen the folks...it's nice you send

them the fifty a month...

SIDNEY

(after a pause)

See my mother?

D'ANGELO

(shaking his head)

I only had a few hours.

D'ANGELO

Thanks for the publicity spread you

got the boys for the benefit

tomorrow.

SIDNEY

(begrudgingly)

Robard's my client.  I did it for

him and his club, not your boys.

SIDNEY

(quietly)

Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.

D'ANGELO

(quietly)

Looka, Sidney, you're my own

sister's son, but where does that

give you the right to call me a liar?

SIDNEY

(looking towards Steve)

You told me that your boy was

washed up with Susie Hunsecker,

didn't you?

D'ANGELO

Yeah, and it's the truth, to the

best of my knowledge.  And, frankly,

I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm

glad, not yours.  I manage these

boys and I got their best interests

at heart.  Steve shouldn't get

mixed up with no bimbo at his age.

SIDNEY

(narrowly)

You told him that?

D'ANGELO

Not in those exact words - you know

what a temper he's got.

SIDNEY

When do these hot-headed boys of

yours go on the road?

D'ANGELO

Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.

SIDNEY

That's a nice tour.  All booked?

(Frank nodding)

When was Susie around here last?

D'ANGELO

Four five nights ago.  That's how I

know the romance is off.  Also

Steve's in a very bad mood.

SIDNEY

(abruptly)

Listen, Frank, you'd better make

sure you're telling me the truth.

D'ANGELO

(annoyed)

I don't like this threatening

attitude.  When it comes to it,

what the heck is it your business

what they do, this boy and girl...

SIDNEY

If you knew Hunsecker as well as I

did, you might understand why it's

my business.  Maybe you're walking

around blind, Frank, without a cane.

SIDNEY

...and in case you didn't know it,

Susie Hunsecker's out there on the

back step right now.

CHICO

Hi!  Susie...

SUSAN

Hello, Chico.  Paul.

CHICO

(to Paul)

Throw a rope round this chick while

I go get Steve.

SUSAN

Full house...?

PAUL

Packin' 'em in.

DEVOTEE

I'm terribly interested in jazz --

serious jazz.  You studied with

Milhaud, didn't you?  This is such

an interesting fusion of the

traditional, classical form with

the new progressive style, I just

wanted to ask you how you came to

form the group...-

STEVE

Well, we just sort of got together.

(turning to introduce Fred)

Maybe if you ask Mr. Katz...He

writes the stuff, you know.

FRED

(blankly)

Huh?

CHICO

Don't waste your time there, man.

You've got something better waiting

outside...

(as Steve looks at him)

Susie's out there.

STEVE

What did she say...?

CHICO

You proposed to her, not me.

(slapping him on the back)

Go get your answer...

SUSAN

(in a whisper)

Steve...I'll...I'll try to make a

good wife.

SIDNEY

Hi, Fellows.  Where's the Chief?

FRED

Who?

SIDNEY

(who gets the point)

Dallas.  Is he around?

CHICO

(unhelpfully)

Yeah, he's around somewhere.

Upstairs, maybe.

SIDNEY

(coldly, as he goes)

Thanks.

STEVE

(incoherent)

This is big, you know.  Very big!

Let's go out later, drink some

firewater.  With the boys.  Fred

can call Millie and -

SUSAN

Steve, I'd rather you didn't say

anything for a day or two...until I

tell my brother...

STEVE

(gently)

You haven't told him yet...

SUSAN

I'm telling him in the morning

after breakfast.

STEVE

He isn't going to like it.

STEVE

You sure you don't want me to be

with you...?

SUSAN

Steve, my brother isn't as bad as

he's painted.  He isn't perfect,

but -

STEVE

But he isn't going to like this,

Susie.  And he makes you nervous,

not me.  No, I take that back - he

makes me nervous, too.  But I

wouldn't give him a second thought

if not for you.

SUSAN

Let's forget him and -

STEVE

His stooge, Falco, is around - I

saw him walk in.

(soberly)

He's been spying on me for weeks,

Susie.

SUSAN

(quickly, perhaps too quickly)

Darling, I don't care - really I

don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush

on me for years, but nothing we do

is his business -

STEVE

(gently insisting)

But he could be reporting back to

your brother, couldn't he?

SUSAN

(pleading)

Steve, dear, please forget all of

this.  What can it matter after

tomorrow?

STEVE

(softly)

I have a message for you; I love

you.

(kissing her lightly)

May I dedicate the next number to

you?...And the next, and the next.

Every Sunday I'll buy you a new

bonnet -

SUSAN

(amused, but moved)

If the stores are open -

STEVE

And on Monday, I'll take it off and

stroke your light brown hair and -

SUSAN

And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer.

STEVE

(abruptly grinning)

How do you think I realized I love

you?

SUSAN

I made you write a beautiful song...

STEVE

No, you had me eating that Chinese

food!...

SIDNEY

Can more than two enjoy this joke...

(to Susan)

Hello, Susie, I didn't expect to

find you here.

SIDNEY

Where's those glossy prints you

promised?  Tonight's the latest I

can place them -

STEVE

(barely polite)

Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget

it.

(to Susan)

It's cold out here, Susie.

SIDNEY

(lightly sarcastic)

Let me apologize for getting you

that press spread.  It's been an

honor to serve you gratis.

STEVE

(levelly)

I get the feeling, Falco, that

you're always snooping around...

SUSAN

(quickly intervening)

Steve, stop it please...

D'ANGELO

What are you boys fighting about?

SIDNEY

(sarcastic)

Kill me!  Find me a door somewhere -

I walked in without knocking!

STEVE

I'm feeling too good to fight with

you, but that isn't what I said - I

said you snoop.  For instance, what

were you doing around my hotel the

other night?

SIDNEY

(needling)

Begging your pardon, I haven't been

down the bowery in years!

D'ANGELO

(soothingly)

Come on boys, break it up...

STEVE

(overriding D'Angelo)

The next time you want information,

Falco, don't scratch for it like a

dog - ask for it like a man!

SIDNEY

If you're going home, Susie, I'll

drop you off...

CHICO

(easily)

Time for the next set, Chief...

STEVE

Just a minute, Chico.

STEVE

(fondly)

Just so you don't leave me in a

minor key.

SIDNEY

Don't tell me you started a polka

with Leo Bartha?

RITA

(shaking her head)

No.  That's what I mean - I'm being

fired for what I didn't do.

RITA

(soto voce)

He came in last week on a very dull

rainy night.  I know who he was,

but I didn't let on.

(emphatically)

He didn't take his eyes off me all

night.  Listening...?

SIDNEY

Avidly.  He was staring.

RITA

(continuing)

Staring.  Consequently, when he

approached me on his way out I

wasn't surprised, but I didn't let

on.

SIDNEY

(prompting)

He was writing a special Sunday

piece on...?

RITA

(nodding)

...cigarette girls... And naturally -

SIDNEY

You were thrilled to be interviewed.

(she nods)

Were you "interviewed"?

RITA

In his apartment -

SIDNEY

And where was his wife?

RITA

I don't know - it's a big apartment.

But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact,

I was totally unprepared for what

happened.

SIDNEY

(grimacing)

We're old friends, Chickie - quit

it!  A big columnist comes in this

room, without his ball-and-chain

and you make like a delicatessen

counter!  What did you think would

happen in his house?

RITA

(with a nod)

But, Sidney darling, the man must

be out of his mind - it was only

eleven o'clock in the morning!

RITA

For a moment I was so taken aback

that I said anything that popped

into my sleepy head.  If I'm not

mistaken, I even ordered the man

out of his own house.

RITA

(rapidly)

He was furious and, by the time I

could have put on a Tropical Island

mood, I was out on the street!...

(dolefully)

That night Mr. Van Cleve calls me

into his office here.  He's got

nothing against me, he says but he

can't afford to antagonize

columnists.  I told him I still

have Sonny at military academy, but

Van Cleve's made of ice...

RITA

(tentative)

Do you think you could do something,

Sidney?

SIDNEY

(a quick nod)

That's what I'm thinking, Rita.

Maybe...

RITA

Do you still keep your key under

the mat?

SIDNEY

(eyeing her)

Can you be there by two-thirty?

STEVE

Frank, I don't want any secrets

from you.  I proposed to Susie

tonight.

D'ANGELO

Did she accept?

STEVE

You don't like it, do you.  I think

she will accept, but I'm not sure.

She may be too dependent on her

brother.

D'ANGELO

(solemnly)

Lots of good people in this town

are dependent on her brother...

SUSAN

You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so

touchy...

SIDNEY

(gruffly)

I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I

came to bring him a present.

(then)

Wanna bite to eat?

SIDNEY

Feels like a Monday night, don't

it...?

SUSAN

(softly)

Not to me.  Sometimes, the world

feels like a cage.  Then someone

comes along and opens the door...and

it's never Monday night again...

(turning to Sidney)

I wish you and Steve could like

each other.

SIDNEY

(grimacing)

We stick in each others craw.

SUSAN

Yes, but why?

SIDNEY

Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J.

is some kind of monster.

SUSAN

Don't you?

SIDNEY

Susie, your brother's one of my

best friends, and -

SUSAN

I know.  But someday I'd like to

look into your clever mind and see

what you REALLY think of him -

SIDNEY

Where do you come off to make a

remark like that?

SUSAN

(quietly)

Who could love a man who keeps

jumping through burning hoops, like

a trained poodle?

SUSAN

(thoughtfully)

Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?

SIDNEY

(glibly)

Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He

thinks he's very gifted - those

boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.

SIDNEY

(gently)

You feel pretty strong about this

boy?

SIDNEY

Wedding bells, you mean?

SUSAN

He wants me to go on the road with

them.  It's an eight month tour,

all the way to Oregon...

SIDNEY

Well, congratulations.  But don't

go just for the ride!  Or didn't

you accept the proposal?

SUSAN

I'm going to discuss it with J.J.

in the morning.

SUSAN

(softly)

It's given me a big lift to know

that some people want me for

myself, not just because I'm my

brother's sister.

SIDNEY

Chickie, I'll have to laugh at

that - an attractive girl like

you...!

SUSAN

I hope that J.J. really likes

Steve, that it isn't an act.

SIDNEY

(with an indignant edge)

Why should he put on an act?  Your

brother has told PRESIDENTS where

to go and what to do!

SUSAN

The act would be for my sake, not

Steve's...

SIDNEY

(to cabbie)

Wait for me.  I'll be right back.

SIDNEY

(lightly)

It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll

talk to you like an uncle...

SUSAN

(smiling)

But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.

SIDNEY

No, I mean because I admire you -

in fact, more than admire you -

although that's neither here nor

there.

(quickly skipping to

the important point)

Susie, don't sell your brother

short.  Talk this over with him, I

mean - you'll find him a real friend.

SIDNEY

Any message, in case I see J.J.

later?

SUSAN

Yes.  Tell him for me that Steve

Dallas is the first real man I've

ever been in love with...

SIDNEY

The Twenty One Club.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

SIDNEY

Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I

am just going -

WELDON

(overlapping)

Yeah.  A coincidence you should run

into the very man you've been

ducking all week!

(to the girl)

This is my press agent, Joan.

SIDNEY

(quickly)

I tried to reach you twice -

WELDON

(overlapping)

What do you do for that hundred a

week.  Fall out of bed?

SIDNEY

Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right

now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can

promise you -

WELDON

(horsing)

Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest

this kid for larceny!

SIDNEY

Listen, when your band was playing

at Roseland -

WELDON

(cutting in)

That was two months ago.  Take your

hand out of my pocket, thief!

THE GIRL

Take it easy, Jimmy dear...

WELDON

(indignantly)

Why?  It's a dirty job, but I pay

clean money for it, don't I?

SIDNEY

No more you don't!  What is this -

You're showing off for her?  They're

supposed to hear you in Korea?

WELDON

(smirking to the girl)

He's intuitive - he knows he's

getting fired!

SIDNEY

If you're funny, James, I'm a

pretzel!  Drop dead!

WELDON

It was nice knowing you, Sidney.

Not cheap - but nice.  Happy

unemployment insurance.

CAPTAIN

How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?

SIDNEY

(nodding towards the restaurant)

Is "he" inside?

CAPTAIN

But of course...

SIDNEY

Alone or surrounded?

CAPTAIN

A Senator, an Agent and Something -

With - Long - Red - Hair.

SIDNEY

Honey, get me Mr. Hunsecker.

OPERATOR

He's right inside, Mr. Falco.

SIDNEY

(from inside the booth)

So it isn't Long Distance.

SIDNEY

(to phone)

J.J.?  It's me --

SIDNEY

J.J., it's Sidney.  Can you come

outside for one minute?

HUNSECKER (O.S.)

Can I come out?  No.

SIDNEY

(tensely)

I have to talk to you, alone, J.J.,

that's why.

HUNSECKER (O.S.)

You had something to do for me -

you didn't do it.

SIDNEY

Can I come in for a minute?

HUNSECKER (O.S.)

No.  You're dead, son - get yourself

buried!

HUNSECKER

I'll check it in the morning, Low -

thanks.

HUNSECKER

(softly)

Harvey, I often wish I were dead

and wore a hearing aid...with a

simple flick of a switch I could

shut out the greedy murmur of

little men...

SIDNEY

J.J., I need your ear for two

minutes...

HUNSECKER

Mac!  I don't want this man at my

table...

SIDNEY

(quickly but quietly interrupting)

I have a message from your sister.

HUNSECKER

Forgive me, Harvey.  We were

interrupted before -

SENATOR

(who is mildly

surprised and faintly embarrassed)

Err...the Supreme Court story, I

was telling you - Justice Black.

HUNSECKER

(nodding)

Yes, the Justice, that's right.

But I think you had it in the column.

SIDNEY

(smoothly, casually)

Last July, the lead item...

SENATOR

(laughing)

And I believe that's precisely

where I read it, too.  You see,

J.J., where I get my reputation for

being the best-informed man in

Washington.

HUNSECKER

Now don't kid a kidder.

SENATOR

I don't think we caught your name,

young man.

SIDNEY

Sidney Falco, sir.  And, of course,

everyone knows and admires you,

Senator Walker.

SENATOR

(humorously)

Every four years I get less

convinced of that.  This young lady

is Miss Linda James.

(indicates the Girl)

She's managed by Manny Davis.

(he indicates the Agent)

SIDNEY

I know Manny Davis.

HUNSECKER

(quietly)

Everyone knows Manny Davis...

(as the phone rings

on the table)

...except MRS. Manny Davis.

HUNSECKER

Yes?  Go ahead, Billy - shoot...

HUNSECKER

Uh huh.  Sports cars in California

are getting smaller and

smaller...the other day you were

crossing Hollywood Boulevard and

you were hit by one...you had to go

to the hospital and have it

removed...

(coolly)

You're not following the column: I

had it last week.

SIDNEY

Do you believe in capital

punishment, Senator?

SENATOR

Why?

SIDNEY

(pointing to the phone)

A man has just been sentenced to

death...

HUNSECKER

Manny, what exactly are the UNSEEN

gifts of this lovely young thing

that you manage...?

AGENT

Well, she sings a little...you

know, sings...

GIRL

(by rote)

Manny's faith in me is simply awe-

inspiring, Mr. Hunsecker.  Actually,

I'm still studying, but -

HUNSECKER

What subject?

GIRL

Singing, of course...straight

concert and -

HUNSECKER

Why "of course"?  It might, for

instance, be politics...

GIRL

Me?  I mean "I"?  Are you kidding,

Mr. Hunsecker?  With my Jersey City

brains?

HUNSECKER

The brains may be Jersey City, but

the clothes are Trainor-Norell.

SENATOR

Are you an actor, Mr. Falco?

GIRL

(supporting the

change of subject)

That's what I was thinking.  Are

you, Mr. Falco?

HUNSECKER

How did you guess it, Miss James?

GIRL

He's so pretty, that's how.

HUNSECKER

Mr. Falco, let it be said at once,

is a man of FORTY faces, not one,

none too pretty and ALL deceptive.

See that grin?  It's the charming

street urchin's face.  It's part of

his "helpless" act - he throws

himself on your mercy.  I skip the

pleading nervous bit that sometimes

blends over into bluster.  The

moist grateful eye is a favorite

face with him - it frequently ties

in with the act of boyish candor:

he's talking straight from the

heart, get it?  He's got about

half-a-dozen faces for the ladies,

but the real cut one to me is the

quick dependable chap - nothing he

won't do for you in a pinch.  At

least, so he says!  Tonight Mr.

Falco, whom I did not invite to sit

at this table, is about to show in

his last and most pitiful role:

pale face with tongue hanging out.

In brief, gentlemen and Jersey

Lilly, the boy sitting with us is a

hungry press agent and fully up to

all the tricks of his very slimy

trade!

HUNSECKER

(quietly)

Match me, Sidney...

SIDNEY

(coolly)

Not just this minute, J.J....

HUNSECKER

I know - that loafer of yours opens

at the Latin Quarter next week.

(more sharply)

Say goodbye, Lester!

SENATOR

May I ask a naive question, Mr.

Falco?  Exactly how does a press

agent work...?

HUNSECKER

Why don't you answer the man,

Sidalee?  He's trying to take you

off the hook.

SIDNEY

(to the Senator)

You just had a good example of it.

A press agent eats a columnists

dirt and is expected to call it

manna.

GIRL

What's manna?

HUNSECKER

Heaven dust.

SENATOR

But don't you help columnists by

furnishing them with items?

SIDNEY

Sure, columnists can't get along

without us.  Only our good and

great friend, J.J., forgets to

mention that.  We furnish him with

items -

HUNSECKER

What, some cheap, gruesome gags?

SIDNEY

(to Hunsecker now)

You print them, don't you?

HUNSECKER

Yes, with your clients' names

attached.  That's the only reason

those poor slobs pay you - to see

their names in my column all over

the world!  Now, as I make it out,

you're doing ME a favor!

SIDNEY

I didn't say that, J.J.

HUNSECKER

The day that I can't get along

without press agents' handouts,

I'll close up shop, lock, stock and

barrel and move to Alaska.

AGENT

(nodding)

Sweep out my igloo, here I come.

HUNSECKER

(to the Agent)

Look, Manny, you rode in here on

the Senator's shirt tails, so shut

your mouth!

SENATOR

(slowly)

Now, come, J.J., that's a little

too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game

for you tonight.

HUNSECKER

(not as harsh, but -)

This man is not for you, Harvey,

and you shouldn't be seen with him

in public.  Because that's another

part of a press agents life - he

digs up scandal among prominent men

and shovels it thin among the

columnists who give him space.

SENATOR

There is some allusion here that

escapes me...

HUNSECKER

(an edge of threat)

We're friends, Harvey - we go as

far back as when you were a fresh

kid Congressman, don't we?

SENATOR

Why does everything you say sound

like a threat?

HUNSECKER

Maybe it's a mannerism - because I

don't threaten friends, Harvey.

But why furnish your enemies with

ammunition?  You're a family man.

Someday, with God willing, you may

wanna be President.  Now here you

are, Harvey, out in the open where

any hep person knows that this one...

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

...is toting THAT one...

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

...around for you...

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

...Are we kids or what?...

HUNSECKER

(to the Senator, affably)

Next time you come up, you might

join me at my TV show.

SENATOR

(quietly and cautiously)

Thank you, J.J., for what I consider

sound advice.

HUNSECKER

(deadpan)

Go, Thou, and sin no more.

HUNSECKER

Mac, don't let the Senator pay that

check...

CAPTAIN

I'll take care of it, Mr. Hunsecker.

HUNSECKER

(murmuring)

President!  My big toe would make a

better President!

ATTENDANT

Mr. Hunsecker's coat, Joe.

HUNSECKER

Find me a good one, Joe.

HUNSECKER

Dan, anyone calls, tell 'em I'll be

at the Morocco, maybe the Embers.

DAN

Very good, Mr. Hunsecker.

HUNSECKER

Where's your coat, Sidalee?  Saving

tips?

HUNSECKER

(to Sidney)

My curiosity is killing me; what

are you so rambunctious about

tonight?

SIDNEY

There's your fat friend.

HUNSECKER

(as he approaches)

Hello, Harry.

KELLO

(cheerfully)

Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?

HUNSECKER

(turning to Sidney)

You see, Sidalee, that shows that

Lt. Kello likes your people.

KELLO

It's my Brooklyn background, J.J.

I'm good on Yiddish, too.

HUNSECKER

Harry, am I supposed to say "uncle"?

HUNSECKER

Anything fit to print, tonight?

(to the policeman in

the car)

Hello, Phil.  How're the kids.

PHIL

Fine, Mr. Hunsecker.

HUNSECKER

Any news fit to print tonight?

KELLO

(joining Hunsecker)

I just checked "downtown".  Quiet

everywhere tonight.

HUNSECKER

Incidentally, what happened to that

doll? - You gave me the item last

night.  Still alive?

KELLO

Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging

on.  But they still don't know if

she was pushed.

HUNSECKER

She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?

(to the policeman in

the car)

Check it for me, Phil...it's a real

heart throb.

HUNSECKER

(to Kello)

Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle

him - he's been a bad boy tonight.

He called you my fat friend.

KELLO

(mildly)

I don't believe it.

SIDNEY

I know...I know you're the strongest

cop in town.

KELLO

(with a laugh)

I call him the boy with the ice

cream face!

HUNSECKER

(laughing)

Say, that's good - it's nice - in

fact, it's APT, Harry!

KELLO

(modestly)

Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things

together.

HUNSECKER

I remember ONCE when you didn't

quite "put things together".  Boy!

Was the Mayor mad!

KELLO

Citizens committees!  I didn't mean

to hit the boy that hard.  Yeah,

that's when a feller needed a

friend and I won't forget his

initials, J.J.

PHIL

(to Hunsecker)

She died twenty minutes ago, Mr.

Hunsecker.  They're still

investigating.

HUNSECKER

(shaking his head

with total dismissal)

That's show business.  Thanks, Phil.

(to Kello)

See you.

KELLO

(as he does so)

Hasta La Vista, J.J.  Hasta Luego.

SIDNEY

Spahish...that must show he likes

"spigs", too.

HUNSECKER

I like Harry, but I can't deny he

sweats a little.

HUNSECKER

I love this dirty town.

HUNSECKER

(after a pause)

Conjugate me a verb, Sidney.  For

instance, TO PROMISE!

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

You told me you'd break up that

romance - when?

SIDNEY

(hesitantly)

You want something done, J.J., but

I doubt if you yourself know what's

involved.

HUNSECKER

(soft and sardonic)

I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.

SIDNEY

(carefully)

Why not break it up yourself?  You

could do it in two minutes flat.

HUNSECKER

(harshly)

At this late date you need

explanations...?  Susie's all I

got - now that she's growing up, I

want my relationship with her to

stay at least at par!  I don't

intend to antagonize her if I don't

have to.

(starting to walk again)

Now, be warned, son - I'll have to

blitz you...

SIDNEY

Frankly, J.J., I don't think you

got the cards to blitz me.

HUNSECKER

I don't?

SIDNEY

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I

don't think so...

HUNSECKER

(turning to eye him)

I'll listen one more minute.

SIDNEY

(very rapidly)

About a year ago, you asked me to

do a favor.  It was a thing - well,

I never did a thing that dirty in

all my life.

SIDNEY

Awright, that brings us up to five

weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty

little problem here." Did I say no?

I'm frank to admit - it don't jell

as fast as we like... But all of a

sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE

NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of

this date, am I frozen out of the

column...

HUNSECKER

(scornfully)

Are you finished?

SIDNEY

(quickly)

No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE

THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on

matinee days - otherwise he's got a

head.  And Susan, like you said,

she's growing up.  Two heads.

What I mean, we got a slippery,

dangerous problem here!

HUNSECKER

(incisively)

Not "we", Sidney, you!

SIDNEY

(gamely)

Correct me if I'm wrong - WE!

Because when I'm out on this very

slippery limb for you, you have to

know what's involved.

HUNSECKER

(sardonically)

Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my

left hand for thirty years!

SIDNEY

I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me

wrong - in for a penny, in for a

pound.  I'll see it through, but

stop beating me around the head.

Let me make a living!

HUNSECKER

(his mouth tight and mean)

What you promised - do it!  Don't

finagle around.  It's later than

you think.

SIDNEY

(as Hunsecker passes him)

Excuse it, but it's later than you

think.  That boy proposed tonight.

HUNSECKER

Susie told you that...?

HUNSECKER

No wonder you've been so 'feisty'

tonight.

HUNSECKER

(quietly)

Can you deliver?

SIDNEY

Uh huh.

HUNSECKER

When?

SIDNEY

Tonight.  Before you go to bed.

The cat is in the bag and the bag

is in the river.

HUNSECKER

(quietly)

Don't be a two time loser, Sidalee.

The sentence could be severe...

QUICK LAP DISSOLVE TO:

CAPTAIN

Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?

SIDNEY

(shaking his head)

Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha

been in?

CAPTAIN

Yeah, having supper with the Mrs.

She's over there.

CAPTAIN

He's somewhere...

SIDNEY

(interrupting)

Thanks, I see him...

SIDNEY

Hello, Leo.  How goes that Sunday

piece on cigarette girls?

BARTHA

(cautiously)

Who told you about it?

SIDNEY

The cigarettes girl...Rita.  And

she took out all her hairpins, too.

SIDNEY

I never had the pleasure of meeting

your wife.  You know what I wonder,

Leo?  Could you use a hot little

item for tomorrow's column?

BARTHA

What is this, blackmail?  Beat it!

SIDNEY

Leo, I've never had the pleasure of

meeting your wife...

BARTHA

Loretta...Sidney Falco...

WIFE

(chatty)

How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you

know anything about horses, sit a

minute.  Help yourself to a glass

of this N.Y. State champagne -

that's what my husband buys me.

SIDNEY

All the imported wines aren't what

they're cracked up to be.

WIFE

Whose side are you on, Mr. Falco,

his or mine?

SIDNEY

Frankly, Mrs. Bartha, I'm a neutral

observer for the United Nations.

WIFE

What's your first name?

SIDNEY

(over scene)

Sidney.

WIFE

(searching the column)

No horse running tomorrow by that

name...

BARTHA

You ought to stop this nonsense,

Loretta, these two dollar bets.

WIFE

(cheerfully)

It's compensation, Leo, for the

marginal life we lead.

(to Sidney)

Sidney, did you hear the story

about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?

BARTHA

(sharply interrupting)

That's right!  Tell him, so I can

read it in Hunsecker's column first!

WIFE

(to Sidney, brightly)

Oh, are you a spy for the other side?

SIDNEY

No, I actually sat down to give Leo

an item.

WIFE

Leo, he wants to give you an item -

don't be sullen.

BARTHA

(to his wife)

Will you mind your own business!

WIFE

(calmly)

Hitler!

SIDNEY

Just in case you'd like to print

it, Leo.  It's a blind - no names

mentioned.  But for your private

information, the guy's name is

Dallas.

WIFE

(concentrating on the tabloid)

There isn't a single name here that

gives off vibrations...

SIDNEY

Anything there with a name like

"cigarette girl"?

WIFE

MMmmmm..."cigarette girl"... No, no

horse with a name like that...

BARTHA

I don't print blind items.

WIFE

What is this, chess or checkers...?

SIDNEY

(pointedly)

Neither does Hunsecker.

(fractional pause)

He likes to use the real names...

WIFE

Where are we running?  What am I

missing here?

BARTHA

Waiter, the check.

(to wife)

This man is trying to hold a gun to

my head!

WIFE

(abruptly)

That's the horse!  Shotgun -

Shotgun in the fifth!

BARTHA

(sternly)

What do you want to tell my wife,

Sidney...?

WIFE

(indignantly)

He wants to tell me that you poured

champagne all over my lap.

BARTHA

Go on, tell her, I'm waiting!

SIDNEY

(flustered)

What are you talking about?  Are

you nuts or what?

BARTHA

Lorry, I can't let this man

blackmail me...

WIFE

Blackmail...?

BARTHA

He wants me to print a dirty smear

item for keeping his mouth shut

WIFE

About what?

BARTHA

Foolishly, Lorry, and I hope you'll

understand... this cigarette

girl...I was kidding around with

her...this girl, I mean...I was

kidding around and she took it

seriously.  It was a case of bad

judgment, Lorry, bad taste...and

I'm just sorry, Lorry, that's all...

BARTHA

Your friend Hunsecker - you can

tell him for me - he's a disgrace

to his profession.  Never mind my

bilious private life - I print a

decent, responsible column - that's

the way it stays!  Your man -

there's nothing he won't print if

it satisfies his vanity or his

spite!  He'll use any spice to

pepper up his daily garbage!  Tell

him I said so and that, like

yourself, he's got the morals of a

guinea pig and the scruples of a

gangster!

SIDNEY

What do I do now?  Whistle "The

Stars and Stripes Forever?"

WIFE

(lightly)

What you do now, Mr. Falco, is crow

like a hen - you have just laid an

egg.

WIFE

Leo, this is one of the cleanest

things I've seen you do in years...

WAITER

Otis Elwell wants to see you, Sidney.

ELWELL

(pleasantly)

I see Bartha gave you cold tongue

for supper.

(as Sidney starts to leave)

Hey, wait a minute!

SIDNEY

(hesitating)

I'm late for a date with a dame.

SIDNEY

Otis, if you're trying to blow this

brawl into an item for your column -

forget it!

ELWELL

(affably)

How is dear old J.J. by the way?

SIDNEY

(his anger relapsing)

Call him up and ask - he might drop

dead with shock.

ELWELL

(lightly)

If it were that easy, you wouldn't

find an empty phone booth for the

next two hours...

ELWELL

(continuing over scene)

...Talk of a wake! - they'd club

each other to cater the affair for

free!

ELWELL

(happily)

By the way, did I hear something

about J.J. giving you the flit gun

treatment - he shut you out of the

column.

(amused)

Why?

SIDNEY

You don't know that lunatic yet?

Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the

gag - when you got him for a

friend, you don't need an enemy!

(a pause, then:)

That's what the fight with Bartha

was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker

froze me out.  So I'm eating humble

pie this month - please print me an

item."

ELWELL

(pleased)

And, instead, he printed his heel

in your face?

SIDNEY

(morose)

I see you're full of human

feelings...

ELWELL

(with a shrug)

Like most of the human race,

Sidney, I'm bored.  I'd go a mile

for a chuckle...

SIDNEY

(noting Elwell's preoccupation)

...and two miles for a pretty

girl...?

ELWELL

(lightly)

Three...even four...

ELWELL

(continuing, casually)

Then you're really washed up with

Hunsecker...?

SIDNEY

This is how much I'm washed with

J.J....

SIDNEY

Look, Otis, I make no brief for my

bilious private life, but he's got

the morals of a guinea pig and the

scruples of a gangster.

ELWELL

(dryly)

A fine, fat dirty item.

(offering it back to Sidney)

Who's it about?

SIDNEY

A kid named Dallas, who runs a

dinky jazz quintet.

(he leans closer)

He keeps company with J.J.'s

screwball sister...

SIDNEY

It's a real goody if, like me, you

wanna clobber J.J.!

SIDNEY

He's got his TV tomorrow.  He'd

read it just before rehearsals.

ELWELL

(cautiously)

Mmm.  Trouble is I can't think of

any good reason why I should print

anything you give me.  I can't even

think of a bad reason.

SIDNEY

(gently)

Suppose I introduce you to a lovely

reason, Otis.  One that's good and

bad...and available?

ELWELL

I'm not an unreasonable man...

SIDNEY

Waiter!  The check.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

RITA

(coyly)

Hi!

SIDNEY

(unembarrassed)

Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.

RITA

(with no welcome whatsoever)

Hello.

ELWELL

Friends call me Otis - sometimes

Tricky Otis.

SIDNEY

Otis was outraged when I told him

Van Cleve was going to fire you.

Tell him not to pay any attention

to anything you-know-who says about

you-know-what.

(to Otis)

Right, Otis?

ELWELL

Right!

SIDNEY

I thought you two could talk the

whole thing over till I got back.

RITA

Back?

SIDNEY

One of those business meetings,

honey - always coming up in the

middle of the night.

RITA

(sharply)

Hold on.  You can drop me off on

your way...

ELWELL

(amused by acid)

Consternation reigns...

SIDNEY

(quickly)

Now, Otis...

ELWELL

I hate J.J. -- but not that much at

this moment...

SIDNEY

Give me a chance --

SIDNEY

Don't you know who that man is?

RITA

(bitingly)

Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.

SIDNEY

(nodding with emphasis)

Yeah!

RITA

(aggressively)

And he's a perfect stranger to me.

SIDNEY

(explosively)

So take five minutes!  Get

acquainted!  He's an important

man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!

RITA

What do you want all of a sudden -

Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other

shoe?

SIDNEY

What kind of an act is this?

RITA

Don't you think I have any feelings?

What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A

tangerine that peels in a minute?

SIDNEY

(caustic)

I beg your pardon!  I turn myself

inside out to help you and now I'm

a heavy.

(stooping swiftly as

he discovers her shoe)

Here's your shoe, there's your

coat, that's the door!

RITA

Sidney...I...I don't do this sort

of thing...

SIDNEY

What sort of thing?

RITA

(emphatic)

This sort of thing!

SIDNEY

(as emphatic)

Listen, you need him for a favor,

don't you!  And so do I!  I need

his column--tonight.

(then)

Didn't you ask me to do something

about your job?  Don't you have a

kid in Military School?

RITA

You're a snake, Falco.  You're a

louse, a real louse.

SIDNEY

(persuasively)

Honey - he's going to help you!

You want to lose your job?

RITA

(remonstrating)

A girl needs a little romancing

before she -

SIDNEY

(cutting in)

Next time I'll call in a guy to

paint silver stars on the ceiling!

RITA

(in a small voice)

What would you think of me if -

SIDNEY

(cutting in to

reassure her)

Nothing I didn't think of you before.

RITA

(dryly, with significance)

- that's what I mean!

SIDNEY

(as he opens the door)

How many snorts does it take to put

you in that Tropical Island Mood?

ELWELL

(an inspiration)

Havana!  That's where we met!

RITA

(to Otis)

Here's mud in your column!

SIDNEY

Blessings on thee, the both...well...

Gotta run now.  See you two kids

later!

ELWELL

(lightly)

Hurry back.

SIDNEY

Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

That gives you lots of leeway.

RITA

Palm Springs.  Two years ago.

ELWELL

(delighted)

That's right!

RITA

Don't tell Sidney.

CUT TO:

HUNSECKER

(to phone)

Yes...?  You sound happy, Sidney.

Why should you be happy when I'm

not?

(then)

I'll see the papers when I get up.

How do you spell Picasso, the

French painter?

(languidly writes

down Picasso on his

scratch pad, answering

a query, dryly)

It's an item - I hear he goes out

with three-eyed girls.

SIDNEY

(to phone)

It would be nice if you mentioned

R-O-B-A-R-D - Robard's jazz joint --

it's his 20th anniversary.  Don't

begrudge it to me, J.J. - I owe him

lots of favors.

(glancing toward the

attendant to see that

he has not overheard)

I think you understand, don't you,

that the Dallas skull is badly

dented?  Oh, real bad... starting

today, you can play marbles with

his eyeballs.

(even coquetting)

Don't hold out on me, J.J., mention

Robard.  R.O. -

(hangs up and walks

to street)

HUNSECKER

We shall see what we shall see...

(lazily)

And don't ever use this apartment

phone again; I have a nervous sister.

LAP DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

NEWS VENDOR

The Globe?

SIDNEY

(shaking his head)

Gimme The Record.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

MARY

(to phone)

I have no power to retract, Mr.

Cummings... I'm only Mr. Hunsecker's

secretary.  No.  Nor can I agree

that can retraction is necessary.

Thank you for calling.

LAWYER

(huffily)

I fail to see what's amusing about

these papers.

MARY

I'll get the boss to sign them.

LAWYER

(giving her the papers)

They're important.

MARY

You've said that six times - that's

why I'm smiling.

SIDNEY

Hello, Mary, me darlin' and phwat

are ye up to today?

MARY

That's a question I usually like to

ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.

SIDNEY

What about?

MARY

(shrugging)

Something about a Frank D'Angelo

trying to reach you...

MARY

(continuing)

Is that the man who manages Susie's

boyfriend?

MARY

Have you seen this?  In Otis

Elwell's column.

(reads)

"The dreamy marijuana smoke of a

lad who heads a highbrow jazz

quintet is giving an inelegant odor

to that elegant East Side Club

where he works.  That's no way for

a card-holding Party Member to act.

Moscow won't like, you naughty boy!"

SIDNEY

(into phone)

Sally?  I got the message.  If

D'Angelo calls again, tell him I'll

be at the office around noon.

MARY

Could this be that boy?

SIDNEY

(casually)

Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look

like a reefer smoker...

MARY

(looking at The

Record again)

If this is true, J.J.'s going to

hit the ceiling...

SIDNEY

Can it be news to you that J.J.'s

ceiling needs a plaster job every

six weeks?

MARY

(quietly)

Sidney, you know that J.J. doesn't

like people to look at the column

proof in advance...

SIDNEY

Mary, I'm not "people" - there's

Falco blood, sweat and tears in

that column.

SIDNEY

How about dinner tonight?

MARY

Bribing me again?

SIDNEY

(uncomfortable under

her scrutiny)

And why should I bribe the woman

who holds most of my heart?

MARY

You're a real rascal, Sidney.  I'd

certainly dislike you if I didn't

like you.  You're an amusing boy,

but there isn't a drop of respect

in you for anything alive - you're

too immersed in the theology of

making a fast buck.  Not that I

don't sometimes feel that you yearn

for something better...

SIDNEY

(cynical)

Mary, don't try to sell me the

Brooklyn Bridge.  I happen to know

it belongs to the Dodgers.

MARY

(affably)

I don't mind you looking at the

proof of the column in advance, as

long as J.J. doesn't know.  But

don't do it like a boy stealing gum

from a slot machine.

SIDNEY

Who put this item in about the

comic?

(reading)

"If there's a more hilarious funny

man around than Herbie Temple at

the Palace, you'll have to pardon

us for not catching the name.  We

were too busy screaming." Does this

Temple have a press agent?

MARY

No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional

beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's

funny, so he gave him a plug.

SIDNEY

What's your favorite ribbon to go

around your favorite chocolates?

MARY

Let's wait till Christmas - it's

more legitimate then.

DOORMAN

(calling out)

Hey!

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

SIDNEY

Herbit Temple here yet?

DOORMAN

Yeah, but you can't come in now!

SIDNEY

I'm in, Sonny Boy!

EVANS

I didn't waste words, Herbie, take

my word.  I says, "look, Figo, I'm

not selling you a dozen eggs, I'm

selling you HERBIE TEMPLE", I says,

so don't gimme your lip!

SIDNEY

Hiya, Al!

EVANS

Since when did you two get

acquainted?

SIDNEY

How do you do, Mr. Temple...

EVANS

(uncertain)

Delighted.

SIDNEY

I'm Sidney Falco.

TEMPLE

(still dubious)

Yeah, delighted...

EVANS

Watch this guy, Herbie, he's a

press agent.

TEMPLE

You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!

SIDNEY

(in no way discouraged)

Temple, I caught your act the other

night and -

TEMPLE

Did you now?  On which bounce?

SIDNEY

- and I just had to drop by and

tell you how great I thought you

were.

TEMPLE

(dryly)

Cheers.  What time is it, Al?

EVANS

You got ten minutes.

(to Sidney)

Hope you don't mind, Falco: we're

busy and if -

SIDNEY

No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.

TEMPLE

(scowling)

Good!  We're all off to Utica, so

excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the-

Portisan.

SIDNEY

But can I ask one impertinent

question here?  With no criticism

intended, because I know, Al, you

earn your ten percent, how come you

let a sock act like Herbie Temple

tip-toe through town without a

publicity build...?

EVANS

We're not buying it, Falco - no

fish today.

SIDNEY

I'm not selling.  I'm just curious,

that's all.

TEMPLE

Answer the man, Al, if he asks you

a question.  Quick, before he

thinks up another!

EVANS

Mr. Temple doesn't believe in press

agents - does that answer you

something?

SIDNEY

Take your hand off, lump!

(more politely, to Temple)

No one believes in press agents,

Temple, when they make claims they

can't perform.  I got nothing to

sell - I didn't come here to

peddle - but if I tell a client

that Hunsecker will give him space,

it's not just talk!

EVANS

(after hesitation)

Listen, you bull artist - !

TEMPLE

Let him go, Al...

SIDNEY

(to phone)

Hello?  Mary, let me speak to J.J.,

please...it's Sidney Falco...

SIDNEY

(to phone)

Tell him it's important...

GLORIA

What?  Is this Sidney?...

SIDNEY

(to phone)

Sure, I'll wait...

EVANS

(hesitant)

Look, nobody hired you!  We didn't

talk any deal, and -

SIDNEY

Relax, lump!  I told you I'm not

selling fish...

(abruptly reverting

to the phone)

J.J...Sidney!...How are you,

sweetheart?

(laughing)

Yeah...

(then seriously)

Listen, I know it's late, J.J., but

is it too late to add something

important to the column?

(grinning)

No, not a relative, but important...

SIDNEY

Yeah, if you got a pencil there

I'll suggest a word or two.

Uh...uh...

SIDNEY

(to phone, continuing)

If there's a funnier man in the

world than Herbie Temple at the

Palace...uh...pardon us for not

catching the name, we were too busy

laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.

(then)

It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks.

Probably see you at Twenty One

tonight.  No, for supper, late.

Right. 'Bye...

TEMPLE

Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr.

Falco.

SIDNEY

See me in my office.

TEMPLE

Wait a minute.

(turning back to

encourage Evans)

Speak to him, Al.

(to Sidney, apologetically)

Al makes all my deals.

SIDNEY

(coolly, looking

toward Evans)

I don't like a guy that's quick

with the hands.

(to Temple)

Temple, you've been three passes

behind for twenty years.  This

could start you off big - T.V. and

anywhere.

TEMPLE

And it would cost a pretty penny,

huh?

SIDNEY

(to Evans)

You tell him, I stutter!

EVANS

(shrewdly)

Uh...Why don't we wait till tomorrow?

SIDNEY

(as he goes)

Wait as long as you like - you know

where my office is.

DISSOLVE TO:

SIDNEY

(perkily)

What is here, a wake?

STEVE

You read as you run, don't you?

SIDNEY

It's a habit with me.  So now I'm

briefed.  So what?

STEVE

(glancing at D'Angelo)

Frank thinks I shouldn't have come

here -

D'ANGELO

(a quick correction)

Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely

you shouldn't go around wild,

blaming people without justification.

STEVE

(watchfully, to Sidney)

I thought you might have a faint

idea of how this item originated.

SIDNEY

Why me...?

STEVE

Why not you?

SIDNEY

That's your idea of logic?  I tell

the Judge I didn't murder the man -

the Judge says, "Why not you?"

STEVE

Only two men in this town could be

responsible for that smear - you or

Hunsecker or both.

SIDNEY

(explosively)

Dallas, ask your own manager - he's

standing here like a pained

wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell

are enemies to the knife.  So how

do you get him doing J.J. a favor?

STEVE

(quickly)

It is a favor, isn't it?

SIDNEY

(as quickly)

According to you, yeah.

(continuing rapidly

and with heat)

Dallas, your mouth is as big as a

basket and twice as empty!  I don't

like you, comma, but neither do I

go along with this column saying

you smoke marijuana and belong with

the Reds.  Also, since we're

talking repulsive, J.J. won't like

this for two cents!  Don't give me

that look, Dallas - J.J. believes

in fair play.  And secondly, this

could splatter his sister with

rotten egg by implication - your

her boyfriend!

STEVE

You're talking very fast.

SIDNEY

(expostulating)

Well, I'll tell you what - excuse

me for breathing, will ya?

(wheeling to Sally)

How do you like it?  He comes to my

office and -

D'ANGELO

Boys, this gets nobody nowhere -

you're over excited, Steve and -

STEVE

(sharply)

Don't apologize for me, Frank!

D'ANGELO

...excited with good reason, I

wanted to say.

(to Sidney)

Because this endangers the future

of the whole quintet...

SIDNEY

(lightly)

Should I cry...?

D'ANGELO

(continuing)

...People catch on quick to such an

item.  Van Cleve already called

me - he's firing the quintet.

SIDNEY

Then what are you doing here?  Go

over there and fight!  If Van Cleve

fires your boy, it gives a lie the

ring of truth!

STEVE

I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker,

please.

D'ANGELO

(replying to Sidney's question)

We're on our way there now...

SIDNEY

(who has wheeled on Steve)

What are you calling her for...?

STEVE

(to Sidney)

I'm the boyfriend, remember?  I

hope one day she'll be my wife...

(into the phone, gently)

This is Steve, Susie.  Don't be

alarmed, Susie, but I want you to

look at Elwell's column in The

Record...today...No, about me...

SUSAN

A smear?...What...What kind of

smear...?  Where are you?

STEVE

(to the phone)

We're on our way to the Elysian

Room to dicker with Van Cleve -

he's fired us already.  I'll call

you later, dear... 'Bye!...

STEVE

Come on, Frank.

SIDNEY

(to D'Angelo)

What are you looking at...?

D'ANGELO

(quietly)

The ugly world, Sidney...

(a pause)

If I told Steve what I really

think, he'd tear your head off...

SIDNEY

(sneering)

Tell him.

D'ANGELO

No.  I'm interested in his future.

SIDNEY

What's the matter?

SALLY

(not looking at him)

Nothing...

SIDNEY

You know, Sally, sometimes I get

the impression you think you live

in Star-Bright Park.  This is life,

kid - get used to it!

SIDNEY

(to phone)

Nikko, is Mr. Hunsecker there?

This is Mr. Falco.  Well, have him

call me as soon as he can.  It's

important.

SIDNEY

Did you send my folks in Philly the

check...?

SALLY

Yes.

SIDNEY

(softly)

I put a lotta trust in you,

Chickie...

SALLY

(low-voiced)

I know you do, Sidney.

SIDNEY

Don't judge a situation where you

don't know what's involved...

SALLY

I'm not judging...

SALLY

(pathetically)

I swear, Sidney, I can't help it -

sometimes I wonder what I see in

you...

SIDNEY

(murmuring)

That's no way to talk...

SALLY

Or what you see in me, for that

matter...

SIDNEY

Stay down town tonight.  Maybe

we'll take in a show, etc.

SALLY

If you want me to -

SIDNEY

(exhilarated)

You see?  Hunsecker's gotta phone ME!

SIDNEY

(calmly)

Hello, J.J....I presume you saw the

Elwell smear.

(smiling)

No, no medals - not yet.  Oh, it's

worse than that - Aunty Van Cleve

is firing them...from the horse's

mouth... They were just here - in a

panic...

HUNSECKER

Who was just there?

(then)

You'll be the death of me.  Sidalee!

Why?  Didn't you just tell me that

they've already traced this smear

to you?  All they have to do now is

to put two and two together and I'm

a chicken in a pot!

SIDNEY

J.J., peace on earth, good will to

men - it's working out just the way

I planned.  Yeah, I guarantee this

bomb will pop right on schedule,

but you have to play your part -

you be a Saint and let me be the

Devil.  But I wanna talk to you

first...

HUNSECKER

Don't come here.  Susie is up and

about.

(listening)

He called her?  You'd better see me

at the TV - three o'clock.

SALLY

What are you going to do?

SIDNEY

(the wise one)

Chickie, a lotta people think

they're smart.  You watch.  They're

dumb: they'll do the work for me!

Just watch.

HUNSECKER

The table can wait.  No calls.  I

have to think about my TV show.

NIKKO

Pleased to do.  I will come back

later.

HUNSECKER

(abruptly)

Did you put the bread out on the

terrace for the birds?

NIKKO

Yes, but they don't come no more

this time of year.

HUNSECKER

Susie!  Come in a minute, dear...

HUNSECKER

Susie, you're very much in my

thoughts today.

SUSAN

Why?

HUNSECKER

What a question, dear, with that

newspaper in your hand...

SUSAN

(pausing)

Did Sidney tell you about it?

HUNSECKER

Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this

boy too well.  Anything in these

charges?

HUNSECKER

Not being partial, are you?

SUSAN

(with quiet certainty)

No, I'm not.  I'm not!

HUNSECKER

Susie, take it easy.  I'll trust

your judgment - you don't have to

protest with me.

HUNSECKER

Why are you trembling, dear...?

SUSAN

History repeats itself.  Everything

that happened to Alan Leslie...began

with a smear like this...

HUNSECKER

Yes...

SUSAN

(incoherent)

It's just as if I've seen a ghost

today...

HUNSECKER

(quickly)

But that wasn't your fault, dear,

what happened to Leslie.  I've told

you that a million times...

SUSAN

Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It

was someone's fault, wasn't it?

HUNSECKER

(gravely)

I wouldn't have called the boy

exactly balanced...

SUSAN

(stronger)

Alan was not...unbalanced when I

married him.  And he was

not...'indifferent to women' no

matter what they said!

HUNSECKER

(simply)

I'm not fighting with you, puss...

SUSAN

He never would have killed himself

if I hadn't gone through with the

annulment.  Don't you see that made

all the rumors seem true?  I should

have stood up for him...not run out.

SIDNEY

J.J., I want you to get them back

their job, Steve and the Quintet.

HUNSECKER

("incredulously")

You mean they've been fired already,

on the basis of this crude smear?

HUNSECKER

Susie, you're sure there isn't some

fire where there's this much smoke?

SIDNEY

(earnestly)

I know Steve.  No.

HUNSECKER

Then maybe you can tell me if he's

as solid as you say, why does he

rap me every chance he gets?

SUSAN

(involuntarily)

Sidney is a liar!

HUNSECKER

Who said Sidney?

SUSAN

(defiantly)

I said Sidney!...

HUNSECKER

You know, dear, we're drifting

apart, you and I, and I don't like

that.

SUSAN

I thought we were talking about

Sidney?

HUNSECKER

(with rasp)

Let me finish, dear.  You had your

say, now let me have mine...

SUSAN

(interrupting)

I haven't said anything yet, J.J.,

but if -

HUNSECKER

(gently)

I started to say we're drifting

apart.  A year ago, in your wildest

dreams, would you have walked by

that door without taking up this

situation with me?  Today I had to

call you in!

SUSAN

I'm taking up the situation with

you now...

HUNSECKER

(interrupting)

Susie, I want to help you--,

there's nothing I won't do for you.

You're all I've got in the whole,

wide world.

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

Well, what have I got?  Alimony to

a pair of tramps?  They're of no

concern to me.  It's you who count,

but don't get me wrong - I don't

intend to let you break your neck

again!

SIDNEY

J.J., you said you want to help

me - prove it!

HUNSECKER

(quietly)

How?

SIDNEY

Get Steve back his job...please...

HUNSECKER

(pausing)

He means that much to you...?

SIDNEY

(simply)

Yes.

(then)

With your "prestige" it only takes

a minute - ten cents worth of

American Tel and Tel.

HUNSECKER

You're picking up my lingo, hon.

SIDNEY

(levelly)

I read your column every day...

HUNSECKER

Susie, I like this new attitude of

yours.  You're growing up and I

like it!  I don't like it when

you're limp and dependent, when

you're odd and wayward.  This gives

you a chance for real survival in a

very lousy world.  Because, don't

forget, dear, you won't always have

me with you, will you...?

SIDNEY

No, I won't...

HUNSECKER

This Dallas boy must be good for

you.  Why not bring him around

today, before the show?  This time

I'll clean my glasses for a better

look.

SIDNEY

I'm not sure I can reach him in time.

HUNSECKER

(easily)

Sure you can if you want to, and I

know you'll want to...

(then)

By the way, what's your beef

against little Sidney?

SUSAN

(steadily)

When I'm certain, I'll let you

know...

HUNSECKER

A man couldn't ask for a squarer

shake.

(into phone)

Let me have Billy Van Cleve...

(then)

Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how

I'm tied to your apron strings...

(to phone)

Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about

that boy?  What boy?  Where are we,

lug, in a drawing room comedy?

You're brain is warming up,

sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...

(then)

No, don't explain your point of

view, but...

HUNSECKER

"I was reminded of it this morning,

when I noticed that the birds had

gone South.  We want the same kind

of freedom for ourselves - that's

what the man said!

(he clicks the watch,

pauses to underline

the phrase, continues:)

A man has the right to face his

accusers!  That's the American Way!

Who said?  The man said!  From..."

HUNSECKER

Burton, don't stand around.  If I

go over I'll cut some items off the

tail...

HUNSECKER

"From Washington through to

Jefferson, from Lincoln and F.D.R.

right up to today - the Democratic

Way of Life!  That's what the man

said!  Nowadays it doesn't export

to well...

(then, concluding)

But you know...and I know...that

our best secret weapon is D-E-M-O-

C-R-A-C-Y.

(dropping to a modest tone)

Let's never forget it, ladies and

gentlemen."

MILDRED TAM

That's grand, just grand, J.J.!

(then, anxiously)

Is my makeup all right?  You know,

despite the scads of movies I've

made, I've never appeared on TV

yet...

HUNSECKER

(cutting her short)

Of course, Mildred.  Of course.

You look fine.

(swiftly summoning Mary)

Mary, help Miss Tam - anything she

wants; she's our star today.

HUNSECKER

I got that boy coming over here.

(a glance at Sidney)

What's so funny?

SIDNEY

(who is smiling faintly)

With a pocket fulla firecrackers -

good.

HUNSECKER

(narrowly)

I think you loused this up but good.

If I can trust my eyes, and I think

I can, Susie knows all about your

dirty work.

SIDNEY

(shrugging)

Can't hurt...

HUNSECKER

(incredulously)

Can't hurt?  I had to get him back

his job.

SIDNEY

(smugly)

I like that, too.

(closer, faster)

Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in

one neat bundle, addressed to the

dumps - to oblivion.  We're going

great, but please play it my way.

I cased this kid.

Know his ins and outs...He's fulla

juice and vinegar, just begging for

some big shot like you to give him

a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a

favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. -

the porcupine bit - needles.

HUNSECKER

But it's too late.  I got him back

the job...

SIDNEY

(impatiently)

No, that's the point - he won't

accept your favor!  The manager

yes, but not the boy.

HUNSECKER

Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll

tell you that!

SIDNEY

Sure, he steams her up - wants her

to stand on her own two feet and

all that jazz!

HUNSECKER

And who's feet is she on now?

SIDNEY

Presumably yours...

(a hasty addition)

That's according to St. Dallas.

HUNSECKER

What's this boy got that Susie likes?

SIDNEY

Integrity - acute, like indigestion.

HUNSECKER

What does that mean - integrity?

SIDNEY

(repeating as before)

A pocket fulla firecrackers -

looking for a match!

(grinning)

It's a new wrinkle to tell the

truth... I never thought I'd make a

killing on some guy's "integrity".

HUNSECKER

Full of beans, ain't you?  But you

know that you'll stand or fall by

what you're doing now...

SIDNEY

(grins; confidently)

Calculated risk.  Only we happen to

know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm

your star pupil -- I reflect back

to you your own talent.

HUNSECKER

I wouldn't like to take a bite of

you; you're a cookie full of arsenic.

STEVE

(depressed)

I still think he's responsible for

the smear.

D'ANGELO

Not that I'm convinced, but you'll

never prove it in a million years.

(gently)

Steve, you'll do what you want, but

it can't hurt; he offers you an

olive branch - so today like olives!

STEVE

I guess you're right, but -

D'ANGELO

Steve, sometimes it's better not to

look at your own honesty; but to

look the other man in the face.

Not because you're my meal ticket -

which you are - but because I like

you and the boys, please take my

advice: we -

SUSAN

(in an undertone)

Steve, before we go in - I'd like

to...

SIDNEY

Hey, Susie - This is a real

surprise -- not one but three.

J.J.'s just finishing up his

rehearsal.

HUNSECKER

Looks like a wedding.

SUSAN

Steve, you remember my brother...

STEVE & HUNSECKER

(together)

Of course.

HUNSECKER

Well, son, looks like you went out

and bought yourself a packet of

trouble...

STEVE

You've been very kind about it, Mr.

Hunsecker.

HUNSECKER

Give Susie credit for that.  I took

her word that there was nothing to

the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll

have my say about smears on the

show today.  That's why I'd like

YOUR personal assurance, too.

STEVE

(quietly)

Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to

that smear.  You have my sincere

word...

HUNSECKER

(nodding judicially)

I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME

a favor.

(pausing; to Susan)

Be good to my kid sister...

SIDNEY

(solemnly)

Yeah, she's had a peck of trouble

for a kid...

HUNSECKER

Susie likes to keep her girlish

secrets.  But in her heart of

hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she

fancies you in an uncommon way.

Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just

tom-catting around...I hope?

SUSAN

(quickly)

J.J., Steve isn't...

HUNSECKER

Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't

be much of a man if he didn't

understand my concern.  Would you,

son?

STEVE

(pausing, quietly)

No, I wouldn't...

HUNSECKER

(nodding)

Serious as a deacon...I like it.  I

like your style, son!  In a world

of old rags and bones, I like it!

For instance, take Sidney.

HUNSECKER (CONT'D)

If Sidney got anywhere near Susie

I'd break a bat over Sidney's head!

(smiling faintly)

Sidney lives so much in a moral

twilight that, when I said you were

coming here, he predicted disaster.

You wouldn't take my favor -- you'd

chew up the job, he said, and spit

it right back in my face!

(sniffing)

Any truth in that...?

D'ANGELO

No, Mr. Hunsecker, and if I can

amplify --

HUNSECKER

(motionless)

Don't amplify.

D'ANGELO

Steve wantsa thank you for this

favor.  He --

SIDNEY

(provocatively)

Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just

told you to shut your mouth!

STEVE

(hotly)

Don't you think it's about time you

shut yours?  Who are you to tell a

man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!

D'ANGELO

(warningly)

Steve, that isn't important --

STEVE

Does he have to be here in our hair?

HUNSECKER

Why, has he bothered you before?

STEVE

Is it news to you?

HUNSECKER

Son, lots of people tell me I'm a

gifted man, but I still can't see

around corners.

HUNSECKER

(tolerantly)

Just exactly what are you so hot

about?

(waiting)

I mean, I know it's a difficult

thing to be an artist in this

crudest of possible worlds, but --

STEVE

(impatiently)

Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist!

I'm here as an average Joe, who

happens to love your sister Susie!

HUNSECKER

(with ironic smirk)

Well, just be careful you don't

knock her down, huh?

HUNSECKER

(affably)

Frankly, son, you lost me on that

last hill.  Just give us the punch

line...

STEVE

(agreeably)

No punch line.  Maybe I was just

admiring your know-how---yours and

Falco's.

HUNSECKER

Why do you keep coupling me with

Falco?

STEVE

(innocently)

He's here, isn't he?  Do you think,

sir, when he dies he'll go to the

dog and cat heaven?

SIDNEY

Let's forget cats and dogs and

other pseudo-literary remarks---

I'll just lay it on the line!  What

about that big rumpus in my office

today?  You were there, Frank!

Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J.

was responsible for the Elwell smear!

HUNSECKER

Don't go wild, Sidney.

SIDNEY

Wild?  Take a look at them and see

who's wild...

HUNSECKER

What about that...?

D'ANGELO

(uneasily)

Steve was excited...he didn't mean

it exactly the way it's stated

here...

HUNSECKER

(to Steve)

How did you mean it...?

SIDNEY                         SUSAN

What he likes to---            J.J., I don't want to say---

HUNSECKER

Both of you keep quiet!

(to Sidney)

You've made more damage here in one

minute than a plague of locusts!

If you're tired, Susie, sit down---

this needs investigation!

(to Steve, quieter)

How did you mean it...?

(waiting)

Come on, let's go!  Let's go!...

STEVE

I don't take kindly to you and

Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the

injured party here, you?

HUNSECKER

(with contempt)

Right now you're in no position to

ask questions!  And your snide

remarks---

STEVE

(stronger)

Wait a minute, I haven't handed

over punishing privileges to you

YET!  Put the whip down and I might

respect what you're saying...

HUNSECKER

Susie, did you know about this

accusation...?

SUSAN

(mutely)

No...

HUNSECKER

(abruptly)

Before you leave, son, I'll answer

your question---Susan Hunsecker is

the injured party here!

(balefully)

Or will I be hearing next that I

don't even have my sister's welfare

at heart...

STEVE

Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more

twists than a barrel of pretzels.

HUNSECKER

(unturning)

You hear that, Susie...

(to Steve)

Continue please...

STEVE

(shaking his head)

I'm afraid I can't cope with them.

STEVE (CONT'D)

(simply)

You're too shrewd for me so I'll

just be honest.  Susie and I love

each other, if I'm not mistaken,

and we want to get married.

SIDNEY

Give him credit---the boy's gall is

gorgeous!

STEVE

Why don't we hear what Susie has to

say?

HUNSECKER

(sardonically)

That's stout of you, Dallas, but

Susie may not care to air her

dismal views in public...

STEVE

Susie...?

HUNSECKER

Susie, as always, is free to say

anything she thinks.  Go on, dear,

say exactly what's on your mind,

dear.

STEVE

Those "dears" sound like daggers.

May I suggest that you stop DARING

her to speak?

HUNSECKER

May I lift my eyebrows?  What is

this?  What are you trying to do?

STEVE

(strongly)

I'm trying to get Susie to stand up

to you.  But your manner is so

threatening that she's afraid to

speak!

HUNSECKER

Son, you raise your voice again and

you'll be outa here on your golden

pratt!

SUSAN

Steve, if only for my sake, I want

this stopped!  And the same goes

for you, too, J.J.!

HUNSECKER

(contritely)

Susie, I'm sorry if---

SUSAN

(bitterly)

Sometimes I think ALL men are

fools!...

HUNSECKER

You see, Dallas, a plague on both

our houses...

(then)

We may have to call this game on

account of darkness...

HUNSECKER

If looks could kill, I'm dead...

STEVE

(slowly)

No, I don't care about you --

you're fantastic.  My whole

interest, if it's not too late, is

in Susie...and how to undo what

you've done to her...

HUNSECKER

(smiling)

And what have I done to her,

besides not buy her a new fur coat

lately?  Sidney, you were right --

the boy's a dilly.

STEVE

(stung)

Why?  Because I don't like the way

you toy with human lives? - Your

contempt and malice?  Because I

won't be the accomplice of your

sick ego - and the way it's crippled

Susie...?  You think of yourself -

you and your column - you see

yourself as a national glory...but

to me, and thousands of others like

me, you and your slimy scandal,

your phony patriotics - to me, Mr.

Hunsecker, you are a national

disgrace!

HUNSECKER

(blandly)

Son, I don't fancy shooting

mosquitoes with elephant guns.  So

suppose you just shuffle along and

call it a day...

STEVE

But my day with Susie isn't over

yet and--

HUNSECKER

(cold)

Ten'll get you fifty you're playing

hookey from a padded cell!

SIDNEY

(softly)

You did it, J.J., you did it good...

HUNSECKER

(softly)

You in a mood, Susie, to run over

to Milgrim's later and buy a few

new frocks?

SUSAN

(a small voice)

No.  I'm going home.

HUNSECKER

Want Sidney to drive you over?

HUNSECKER

Drive Susie home.

HUNSECKER

Susie...I...I'd have to take it

very much amiss if you ever saw

that boy again.

SUSAN

(levelly)

I'll never see him again.

HUNSECKER

Call Van Cleve.  Tell him he was

right.  Tell him I said the Dallas

boys are not worthy of his club.

HUNSECKER

(without looking up)

Mary...for Susie's own good...don't

give her misplaced sympathy...

SIDNEY

I'll get you a cab...

SUSAN

(coldly)

Get away from me.

SIDNEY

J.J. asked me to drive you over

and -

SUSAN

I told you to leave!  I don't know

if Steve'll ever talk to me again

and I'm ready to blame it all on you!

SIDNEY

Susie...!

DISSOLVE TO:

HUNSECKER

So that's what "integrity" looks

like.  Well, I'm always willing to

learn...

(later)

How is that slob, D'Angelo, your

uncle?

SIDNEY

My mother's side--her brother.

That reminds me, J.J., Susie looks

run down.  She can stand a vacation

and so can you.  People say, "Oh,

the great J.J., he's made of

iron!", but you can use a rest, guy.

HUNSECKER

What are you so chipper about?  If

I put a cross on every one of your

mistakes, you'd look like a

graveyard!

SIDNEY

(smiling)

But not for anything I did today...

HUNSECKER

Sidney, I know human nature.  Susie

lied to me - she'll see that boy

again.

SIDNEY

You're right, J.J. - she won't give

him up, but it doesn't matter.

Because the real "money ball" is

the boy, not Susan.  And if --

MATRE D'

Mr. Hunsecker this was to be

delivered to you personally -

HUNSECKER

These drinks are warm.

WAITER

You said you like to have them on

your table.

HUNSECKER

What are you a critic?

WAITER

I'll change --

HUNSECKER

Forget it.

(to Sidney)

The real money ball is the boy...

SIDNEY

Yeah, the boy...we're on the verge

of a farce, a real farce.  As I see

it, if Susie had stood behind him

today he might have proved a threat.

But since primarily he's wedded to

his work, he's not going to be able

to take it.

HUNSECKER

(to waiter)

Stop tinkering, pal - that horse

radish won't jump a fence!

SIDNEY

In brief, J.J., it's all over

because any hour now the boy will

give her up.  Is it a farce or not?

HUNSECKER

This syrup you're giving out,

Sidney, you pour over waffles, not

J.J. Hunsecker!  What do you mean

that lousy kid will give up my

sister?

HUNSECKER

Are you listening?

SIDNEY

(warily)

How does it matter who's sister?

The main thing, they're through

and -

HUNSECKER

Am I supposed to forget how that

boy talked to me today?

SIDNEY

J.J., is he worthy of a second

glance from a man like you?  Is he,

I mean?...

HUNSECKER

Brief epitaph: "The boy was talking

when he should have been listening."

(then)

Bite on this.

SIDNEY

Steamship tickets?

HUNSECKER

(as he eats)

For the next sailing of the Mary.

Susan's run down - she's never been

abroad and as you so cogently put

it, I'm not made of iron.

SIDNEY

That's good.  Now that louse is

outa Susie's hair for good.

HUNSECKER

I want that boy taken apart.

SIDNEY

(seriously)

Why do something that would drive

them right back into each other's

arms?  Not to mention that this

time Susie would know who shot the

arrow...

HUNSECKER

(interjecting quietly)

She knows now.

SIDNEY

(quickly)

Why give her real proof?  You

nearly ruined her with her first

husband - and you were right,

J.J., - but she almost followed him

out the window.  What do you want -

a chronic invalid?

HUNSECKER

I know how to handle Susie.  You

just handle the boy, Sidney...

(scribbles on scratch pad)

...preferably tonight.

(pushes pad across to Sidney)

SIDNEY

Why, what's tomorrow - a holiday?

SIDNEY

I think I'll go home - maybe I left

my sense of humor in another suit.

HUNSECKER

You've got that God-given brain -

learn to use it!  Do you think it's

a personal matter with me, this boy?

Are you telling me I see things in

terms of personal pique?  Don't you

see that today that boy wiped his

feet on the choice, on the

predilections of sixty million men

and women of the greatest country

in the world!  If you had any

morals yourself, you would

understand the immorality of that

boy's stand today!  It was not me

he criticized - it was my readers!...

SIDNEY

I'm leaving, J.J....

HUNSECKER

(a quiet warning)

Don't remove the gangplank, Sidney;

you may wanna get back on board.

HUNSECKER

This crab gumbo - terrific!

SIDNEY

J.J., it's one thing to wear your

dog collar...but when it gets to be

a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.

HUNSECKER

The man in jail is always for

freedom.

SIDNEY

(as he rises)

Except, if you'll excuse me, I'm

not in jail.

HUNSECKER

(easily)

Sure you're in jail, Sidney.

You're a prisoner of your own

fears, of your own greed and

ambition; you're in jail.

SIDNEY

J.J.  If you're trying to -

HUNSECKER

(interrupting)

You, little boy, don't know who you

are!  Talking around corners with

the big shots, ten dollar dinners -

fourteen suits and cashmere coats -

you tell yourself THAT'S who you

are!  Later you won't know who you

are without a penthouse on upper

Park!  But underneath it all,

ratting around from day to day, you

DO know who you are!  You're a

fearful, ignorant nobody - a poor

wop kid from the slums of Philly -

hoping nobody else finds it out!

SIDNEY

A little hunch occurs to me - you

have just painted a self-portrait.

You know who YOU are because you

scare people - that's what you've

got against this boy.  He -

HUNSECKER

(cutting in)

I told you what I want you to do

tonight!

SIDNEY

You're blind, Mr. Magoo.  This is a

crossroads for me.  I won't get

Kello.  Not for a life-time pass to

the Polo Grounds.  Not if you serve

me Ingrid Bergman on a plate.

HUNSECKER

(over patient)

Sidney, I told you -

SIDNEY

(continuing)

J.J., I swear to you on my mother's

life, I won't do it.

(he leans even closer)

If you gave me your COLUMN I

wouldn't do a thing like that...

HUNSECKER

(delicately touching

the envelope)

And who do you think writes the

column while Susie and I are away

for three months?...

HUNSECKER (V.O.)

(continuing)

...The man in the moon?

HUNSECKER

(softly)

Thank you, Sidney.

HUNSECKER

And, Sidney, I'll have that piece

of paper back...

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

STEVE

She'll be down in a minute.

D'ANGELO

What does she wanna see you about?

STEVE

She didn't say.

D'ANGELO

I could think of better places to

meet her, instead of here.  He

lives on the whole top floor.

STEVE

(carelessly)

I doubt that it matters any more.

D'ANGELO

Steve.  You made a very dangerous

enemy of him today.  Matter of

fact, I'm very glad we got the tour

ahead.  If I'm any judge, you hurt

him today where he lives... He

won't forget it and he won't

forgive...

SUSAN

(as she comes forward

to join them)

Good evening, Mr. D'Angelo.

SUSAN

Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could

come.

STEVE

Why did you call me?

SUSAN

Would you buy me a cup of coffee?

In there...

STEVE

Sure.

STEVE

We're on our way to Robard's for a

benefit.  I've only got five

minutes...

COUNTERMAN

Too late for service.

STEVE

Just two cups of java.

COUNTERMAN

(with a twinkle)

We serve here only moka coffee.

STEVE

(smiling faintly)

Make it moke.

SUSAN

Steve...what you tried to do

today...you tried to take me up on

a high mountain...I couldn't go all

the way...I failed you...

(a pause)

Will you forgive me?

(then)

Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?

STEVE

Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But

there's no doubt, Susie, that we

have to face some serious things...

SUSAN

No one's ever stood up to my

brother the way you did.

STEVE

(quietly, to the point)

But you didn't do much about it,

Susie.  You walked out, and there I

was...solo...and not too good at

that.

SUSAN

I just didn't think that I could

antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR

sake, I mean.

STEVE

Susie, I was there for OUR sake,

too.  But what a world it would be

if we were all afraid to learn to

walk and talk because it might

offend poppa!  By the way, I think

your brother was completely

responsible for the smears...

SUSAN

Steve, I...

STEVE

(overriding her)

But I don't care about that now.

He knew what he was doing today.

He was laying down the conditions

under which he MIGHT consent to our

marriage - if I would bend to every

whim of his, like Sidney!  I

couldn't do that, Susie...

SUSAN

You're saying goodbye, aren't you?

STEVE

No!  I'm saying that for your sake

you have to make a clean break with

your brother!

SUSAN

(wrenched)

But, please, Steve, please - one

step at a time!  I was born only

yesterday!...

STEVE

(pausing, softer)

I told your brother I couldn't be

his accomplice.  I can't be yours

either, Susie, and encourage him to

go on pulverizing you.  I know what

type - he's my old man all over

again!

STEVE

This beautiful coat is more than

just a coat... I hate it!  It's a

mink straight-jacket!

SUSAN

(drooping)

Steve, I feel exhausted...what do

you want me to do?

STEVE

(not sure of himself)

Not what you're doing now.  At

least don't ask me - don't ask him.

You're fighting for your life!

What do YOU want to do?

SUSAN

(pausing, woodenly)

You are saying goodbye, aren't

you...?

STEVE

(impatiently)

That's fish four days old...!  I

can't buy it, Susie!  Right out of

that mouth I love, like you're a

ventriloquist's dummy, your BROTHER

is saying goodbye!  Gee!...you want

me to be honest, don't you?!

SUSAN

No, Steve, I don't.  I don't.  Not

if it KILLS me I don't!...

SUSAN

(without luster)

Let's not talk any more...you have

to go...

SUSAN

Goodbye, Mr. D'Angelo.  Take care

of Steve.

D'ANGELO

(softly)

I will, Miss Hunsecker.

SUSAN

Say something funny...Mr.

Hasenfeffer.

STEVE

(after a moment)

Look back, Frank, see if she's

still standing there...

D'ANGELO

Still there...

D'ANGELO

(with sympathy)

Not that I don't like her - she's a

very lovely person, but who can

tell?  A year from now you might

thank your stars that it turned out

this way.

(changing the subject)

By the way, Robard said that...

STEVE

Frank, I don't want to make the

benefit.  They'll be jammin' all

night, and the way I feel -- I'd

like to be alone -- I'd like just

to walk and walk and never come back.

D'ANGELO

No.  I don't leave you alone on a

night like this.  And, anyway, you

promised...

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

D'ANGELO

Lew, Steve don't feel too good...

ROBARD

(interjecting)

I'm sorry to hear it.

D'ANGELO

(continuing)

...So, if you don't mind, he'll

leave after this set.

ROBARD

I like that boy, Frank.  Anything

he does is okay with me...

QUICK LAP DISSOLVE TO:

D'ANGELO (O.S.)

Hey!..........

D'ANGELO

(continuing)

Mr. Falco...I hate to give you this

satisfaction - they broke it off

tonight for good.

D'ANGELO

(continuing)

Tell that to Hunsecker - tell him

we agree - he's a big man - he wins

all the marbles!

KELLO

What's all the rush?  You said

three o'clock.

SIDNEY

(glancing back

towards club)

He's leaving early.  After this

"set".  He'll be out in a couple of

minutes...

1ST POLICEMAN

What's this deal tonight?

MURPH

(the 2nd policeman)

One of the lieutenant's "surprise

parties", I think.

1ST POLICEMAN

One of these days I'd like to turn

in my badge and tangle with "POPSIE"

myself - he's no good.

SIDNEY

Can't you wait up the block?  It's

not going to look so good, right in

front of the club...

KELLO

(heavily humorous)

It's nice, Sidney, that you give me

this tip...

SIDNEY

(interjecting)

- He's got them on him.

KELLO

(solemnly nodding his approval)

...And he's got them on him.  I

appreciate a thing like that - I

appreciate where you are looking

out for the virtue of the city.

KELLO

What's your hurry, Snooks?

SIDNEY

(revolted)

Take your hands off, Kello...

KELLO

Murph, how do you like this face?

Why, I'll be darned -- it's melting!

Something got you scared, Sidney...?

Listen, rectify me a certain thing.

Wasn't you kidding, Snooks, when

you told J.J. I was fat...?

SIDNEY

Sleep in peace, Kello -- you're

skinny -- but J.J. says you sweat!

KELLO

Is that a fact?  He's a dilly,

ain't he?  By the by, what did he

have against this boy?

SIDNEY

He goes out with girls.

KELLO

Well, I'll be darned.  And what

does J.J. think he SHOULD do?

SIDNEY

(impudently)

Go out with DIFFERENT girls!

KELLO

(softly now)

I get the peculiar impression,

Snooks, that you don't like me.

Could I be wrong?

SIDNEY

(as he goes)

You could be right, you fat slob?

KELLO

(with a guffaw)

Come back here, Sidney...I wanna

chastise you!...

D'ANGELO (O.S.)

(urgently)

Steve!

D'ANGELO

(fondly)

Press this in your friendship

book...Love is a crooked thing,

friendship not...

(then, sheepishly)

You see, it comes out in the wash

of a few drinks -- I'm a very

sentimental guy.

STEVE

I like it that way, Frank...don't

change.

KELLO

Hey, fella...!

SIDNEY

A bunch of nickels, mister!

SIDNEY

A double Johnny Walker Black.  Or

whatever you got.  Scotch.

BOUNCER

Hey, Robard, somebody just picked

up one of your boys.

ROBARD

What sa -- Wha --

D'ANGELO

(dazed)

Whatsa matter, Lou?

ROBARD

(turning to D'Angelo)

I'm trying to find out myself.

They just picked up Steve.

LOITERER

(blankly)

Some fat guy...

2ND LOITERER

A cop, a couple of cops.

LOITERER

They smeared him all over the lot.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

D'ANGELO

I'm looking for your brother.  Is

he home?

SUSAN

No.

(sensing the

seriousness of his manner)

Mr. D'Angelo - is something wrong?

D'ANGELO

When does he usually gets in, your

night-owl brother?

SUSAN

Seldom before five.

(again)

What's the matter?  Would you care

to come in a minute?

D'ANGELO

No...no.  Thanks.

SUSAN

(taut)

Something's happened.  To Steve.

D'ANGELO

(in a broken voice)

He's in the hospital...He's under

arrest, too... They planted reefer

cigarettes on him...in his overcoat

pocket.

SUSAN

(wildly)

Where is he...I want to go to him...

D'ANGELO

Miss Hunsecker, if you see him

again they might...might kill him.

SUSAN

(slowly)

Who is "they"?

D'ANGELO

Don't ask foolish questions.

(then)

Tell your brother I'm a sensible

man.  He understands only two

things - power-politics and homage -

tell him I came tonight to pay

homage!

SIDNEY

Susan?

SIDNEY

Where's J.J.?

SUSAN

He isn't here...

SIDNEY

But he called and said...

SUSAN

No, I called...

SUSAN

Mr. D'Angelo phoned about Steve...I

went down to the hospital, but they

wouldn't let me in.  He promised to

keep in touch with me - Mr.

D'Angelo, I mean...

SIDNEY

(carefully)

It's all over town about Dallas...

(moving towards her)

How is he?

SUSAN

He's...unconscious...

SUSAN

I...I gave Steve up...

(then)

Why did you and J.J. do it?

SIDNEY

Susie, if I get your meaning,

you're pitching very wild balls.

What -

SUSAN

Don't bother to lie, Sidney.

(moving away)

I don't care anymore.

SIDNEY

Listen, get a good night's sleep -

tomorrow's another day.  Feeling

sorry for yourself won't help.

SUSAN

(shaking her head)

I'm sorry about Steve, not myself.

I'm even sorry for my brother.  To

be so lonely, without one real

friend in the world - to have to

hang on to a worthless rag of a

girl like me because she's his only

real family -

SIDNEY

(moving towards her again)

Come on now, chickie, why don't you

go to bed...?

SUSAN

And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney.

You're going down with the ship.

SIDNEY

What ship?

SUSAN

THIS ship.

SUSAN

Don't you know how my brother will

see you after tonight?  You'll be

the man who drove his little

stainless sister to suicide...

SIDNEY

Honey, I'll just have to smile at

that.

SIDNEY

(as he goes)

It's late and I'm going home...

SIDNEY

Susie, whatever problems you have

with J.J. - I didn't invent them!

What're you blaming me for?  If you

learned to let out your hatred you

would be better off!

SUSAN

Like you?

SIDNEY

Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on

my own gall - I fight back!  Let

THEM choke, not me!

SUSAN

I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -

SIDNEY

I know that bit - you're a girl;

you need a man to give you strength!

So what do you pick such weak

sisters for?  Don't you know yet

that you fight fire with fire, not

with tear drops?

SUSAN

I could almost forgive you if what

you did to Steve came from jealousy

and love...

SIDNEY

(quickly)

I didn't do anything!

SUSAN

...but you did it for greed,

Sidney - and that's pathetic.

SIDNEY

Don't run away - I was always the

man for you!  I'm talking to you

out of two years of silence -

listen to what I say!  Inside of

six months -

SUSAN

(helplessly)

Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -

SIDNEY

(over scene)

Listen to me, lunatic!  All your

life you've been doing penance for

crimes you never committed!  I

could change that, I'd teach you,

I'd show you - !

HUNSECKER

Go to bed, Susie.  It's late...

HUNSECKER

(to Susan)

What is he doing here?

SUSAN

I called him.

SIDNEY

(carefully)

She was depressed - she heard about

Dallas.

HUNSECKER

("controlling" his feelings)

That subject it might be better not

to start me on.

(angry)

He's made all the papers tonight.

HUNSECKER

("mildly")

Is there something you wanted to

say...?

(as she does not

answer, continuing

with growing viciousness)

I've put up with a lot of your

guff, Susie, because you were a

child.  But you're a woman now and

I suspect, despite my best

intentions, more than a bit of a

slut...

SIDNEY

(quickly)

J.J., if you think -

SUSAN

(cutting in)

Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't

matter now...

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

Whose arms will I have to pry you

out of next?  Not that I don't

think you didn't invite it!  I know

that look of yours, that pose of

being wronged - and how it arouses

the crusading instinct in even a

Sidney Falco -

SIDNEY

I was trying to build her up, not

tear her down -

HUNSECKER

(viciously)

Is that why you were romancing her,

you mutt!

(turning back to Susan)

Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd

like it fine if you found another

home.  That means the front door is

open!  Pack your things, rent a

moving van and GIT!

(pacing the room)

And as for marriage, let me hit you

with a few choice facts: you aren't

ready for marriage!  You're

incompetent - a capricious and

shaky frail with a sick fatality

for frail and useless men!

HUNSECKER

(to himself)

Another crisis past.

(walking away)

She'll be fast asleep in five

minutes, loaded with those headache

pills...

HUNSECKER

Now we'll get to you, Sidney.

(turning to Sidney)

As far as the column is concerned -

tonight you have forfeited every

ethical consideration I ever felt

for you...

SIDNEY

(cutting in)

Look, J.J., I'll grant you anything

you want.

(as Hunsecker is

about to interrupt)

Susie's off her rocker tonight!  Go

in and see what she's doing!  Go in

and talk to her quietly - unless

you want a corpse!

HUNSECKER

(acid)

Let me finish what I started to

say -

HUNSECKER

(coming forward)

What a cornball you are, Sidney...

SIDNEY

(anxiously)

Susie!

(in growing fear)

SUSIE!

HUNSECKER

(with authority)

Susie, this is J.J.!  Open up!

SUSAN

(wildly)

No!  NO!  Don't touch me!

HUNSECKER

(sharply)

Susan!...

SUSAN

(her body shaking)

Go away!...Go away!...

SUSAN

(sobbing bitterly)

GO AWAY!

HUNSECKER

(in a choked voice)

Talk to her, Sidney...

SIDNEY

(hushed)

Talk to her yourself...

HUNSECKER

Yuh...Yuh...

(he listens)

Just a minute...

(turning back to Susan)

Susie, it's Mr. D'Angelo - from the

hospital...

SUSAN

Yes...yes...yes...

SUSAN

(speaking with difficulty)

Steve...is out of danger...

HUNSECKER

(soberly)

That means a lot to you?

SUSAN

Yes.

HUNSECKER

But I have to warn you, Susie - for

your own sake - he'll still do

time...

HUNSECKER

(continuing, warming

to his theme)

He's a hop-head - that's a felony

in New York.  I can try, of course,

to...

SIDNEY

You're unholy, J.J.!  You'd rather

kill this girl than let her go!

HUNSECKER

(in blind rage)

GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE!

SIDNEY

(impulsively)

Susie, YOU get out of this house! -

Get out before it's too late!

SIDNEY

(with sincerity)

Listen with care - this will cost

me everything, so you know I'm

telling you the truth!

HUNSECKER

(trying to stop him)

You're incapable of the truth...

SIDNEY

(who will not by stopped)

Susie, there's nothing wrong with

Dallas!

(turning toward Hunsecker)

Your brother and I arranged it all.

And if the Leslie boy is still a

squooshy item in your life, forget

it! - your brother arranged that

one, too!  I don't usually give

away presents; but this is my gift

to you: Get out of here!  Leave

this man!

HUNSECKER

Like most Italians, Sidney's got a

big gift for dramatics.  I, however,

prefer the cool and stubborn facts.

Sidney has not appeared in my

column in weeks - check that fact

with Mary.  That leads right to

another fact: Sidney had nothing to

lose tonight!  To the contrary,

dear - ONLY HIS OBVIOUS GREED TO

BEAT HIS WAY BACK INTO THE COLUMN

EXPLAINS HIS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ME!

In brief, BLACKMAIL!

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

Mind you, not that one true fact

didn't come out of Sidney's mouth

tonight: self-admittedly, he

committed a vicious crime of

jealousy against Steve Dallas!

(pausing)

Now we have to clear Dallas, don't

we?...But I'll have to sacrifice

him...

(he indicates Sidney)

...to do it.

(turning to Susan)

Am I doing right?

HUNSECKER (O.S.)

(over scene)

Yes or no, Susie...?

SUSAN

(very quietly)

He's sick.

SIDNEY

(quietly)

Yes, he's sick and you're the only

idiot alive who didn't know it.

SIDNEY

But what are you going to do?

SIDNEY

(with emphasis)

You don't owe your brother a cup of

water!

SIDNEY

What are you going to do?

SUSAN

Go to Steve.

SIDNEY

(sharply)

For Pete's sake, straighten out the

seams of your stockings - comb your

hair - don't be so helpless all the

time!

HUNSECKER

(to phone)

No, he's admitted that, Harry.  My

kid sister's a witness.

HUNSECKER (O.S.)

(over scene)

No, he admits he planted the stuff

on the Dallas boy...

HUNSECKER

Yeah...jealousy.

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

...He's been trying to make my

sister behind my back.

KELLO

(to phone)

Oh, that's serious, J.J.  Real

reprehensible...

KELLO

(to phone)

Don't worry, I'll get there.  I'm

on Broadway now.

HUNSECKER

(over scene)

That's a pretty coat.

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

- but it's about time you had a new

one.

SUSAN

(soberly)

I'm leaving, J.J.

HUNSECKER

(with a faint scoff)

Don't kid a kidder.  I'll see you

for breakfast around eleven.

SIDNEY

Hello, Harry...

KELLO

Hi!

(coming to join Sidney)

I just been on the phone to J.J.

KELLO

(mildly)

You been a bad boy, Sidney.  J.J.'s

going to write about you in his

column tomorrow.

SIDNEY

I thought he would.

KELLO

Yeah...

(then)

And another thing - he's gonna say

you 'resisted arrest'...

(as Sidney nods)

You know J.J....!

HUNSECKER

(gently)

Susie?

(getting no answer)

Are you in bed...?

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

I don't have to tell you, of

course, that I cleared your

boyfriend's name; I didn't let you

down...

HUNSECKER

...I was saving this news for

breakfast, but I think I'll jump

the gun!  I'M GONNA GIVE YOU AND

DALLAS THE BIGGEST WEDDING THIS

TOWN HAS EVER SEEN!

HUNSECKER

Susie...?

HUNSECKER (O.S.)

(outside)

I'm getting the Mayor to perform

the ceremony and - NO, I think I'll

fly the Governor down from Albany...

(a pause)

Do you hear...?

HUNSECKER (O.S.)

(outside)

Are you listening?...

HUNSECKER

(a note of anger

appearing in his voice)

Susie!...You won't threaten

me!...Nobody walks out on J.J.

Hunsecker!

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

You need me - you all need me!...

HUNSECKER (O.S.)

"The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall

not want".

(a sneering laugh)

That's bunk in a book!  I'm the

Shepherd of millions of little men

and women!...

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

...I don't ask them to get on their

knees, but they come to me for

advice and guidance!  Who are you

to reject me!

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

What makes YOU fit to sit in

judgment on a man like me.  Only a

great person understands another

great person, and that leaves you

out!

HUNSECKER

(continuing)

- That leaves you ALL out!  You're

pigmies!  You're all sick, weak

midgets!  I'm proud to be alone!...
