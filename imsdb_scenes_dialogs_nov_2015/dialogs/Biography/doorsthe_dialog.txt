"THE DOORS"

Screenplay by

Randall Jahnson and Oliver Stone

SHOOTING DRAFT

1991

MORRISON'S VOICE

The movie will begin in five moments

The mindless voice announced

All those unseated will await the

next show

We filed slowly, languidly into the

hall

The auditorium was fast and silent

As we seated and were darkened

The voice continued

"The program for this evening is not

new

You've seen this entertainment

Through and through

You've seen your birth, your life

and death

You might recall all the rest

Did you have a good world when you

died?

Enough to base a movie on?"

ENGINEER

Hey Jim, It's your birthday man,

whaddaya say we try this another

night...

VOICE

(off)

Kill the lights a little more, will

ya John?

ENGINEER

(off)

Hey man, how come the Doors aren't

in on this?

JIM

No music, No Doors. Let's roll... Is

everybody in?... Is Everybody in?...

Is everybody in? The ceremony is

about to begin...

JIM

WAKE UP!!!! HAS THIS DREAM STOPPED!!!!

JIM VOICE

Let me tell you about the heartache

and the loss of God Wandering

wandering in hopeless night Indian's

scattered on dawn's highway bleeding

ghosts crowd the young childs fragile

eggshell mind...

(wind sounds)

JIM VOICE

(continues over imagery)

...me and my mother and father and

grandmother and grandfather were

driving through the desert at dawn

and a truckload of Indian workers

had either hit another car or just --

I don't know what happened... Indians

were scattered all over the highway

bleeding to death.

JIM VOICE

...but it was the first time I tasted

fear. I musta been about four, like

a child is just like a flower, his

head is floating in the breeze.

MOM

It's just a dream, Jimmy, just a

dream

MOM

It's just a dream Jimmy, just a dream

JIM VOICE

...The reaction I get now looking

back is the soul of the ghosts of

those dead Indians -- maybe one or

two of them were just running around

freaking out and just leaped into my

soul -- and they're still there.

(wind, music)

DISSOLVING TO:

RADIO

...from the Texas School Book

Depository. We repeat. President

John F. Kennedy was shot a few minutes

ago in Dallas!

RADIO

(2nd VOICE)

...taken to Parkland Memorial

Hospital. There's no word on the

President's condition. Mrs. Kennedy

is...

WIFE & HUSBAND

Oh God, Oh God. Not the President

for Christ's sake. Oh God -- WHO'S

NEXT?

DISSOLVE TO:

JIM

Hi...

GIRL

Wow! Hi...

JIM

Waste of time...

JIM

GIRL

(impressed)

Wow! You followed me? Why?

JIM

JIM

Mine's Jim.

GIRL

Pam...

JIM

YOUNG MAN

PAMELA

(everything's cool)

That's Jim. My new friend.

JIM'S VOICE

Nietzche said "all great things must

first wear monstrous and terrifying

masks in order to inscribe themselves

on the hearts of humanity". Listen

children -- to the sound of the

Nuremberg night.

JIM VOICE

(on screen)

Have you ever seen God? -- a mandala.

A symmetrical angel. Felt? Yes.

Fucking the Sun. Heard? The music.

Voices. Touched? An animal. Your

hand Tasted? Rare meat, corn, water

and wine

STUDENTS

(ad lib)

SSSSssss... ego trip man, c'mon!

RAY

Hey man it's great, don't listen to

em, it's non-linear man, it's poetry

man, everything Godard stands for.

INSTRUCTOR

This is pretty shocking stuff Mr.

Morrison. And I might say indulgent.

Naziism and masturbation, when used

for shock value, are not art. But to

be constructive, let's start with

your intention. What was it?

STUDENT 1

It was a bore!! That's what!

(laughter)

TRICK

Hey it was better'n a Warhol picture.

GIRL 1

No it wasn't. It was worse!

TRICK

A guy sleeping for seven hours...

STUDENT 2

...is less pretentious! There was no

political consciousness. Naziism

is...

JACK

Hey hold on man! You guys are the

facists!

BONES

It takes genitalism to absurdity

man, just cause the squares here

can't dig it cause the film school's

still so square...

VOICES

Oh c'mon man, give it a break. Boo!

Beatniks go home! Take another

mushroom...

INSTRUCTOR

HOLD IT DOWN!!... Mr. Morrison --

what are your feelings?

JIM

I quit.

(walks out)

TRICK

(to Jim)

Hey man whatdya expect, an Oscar?

BONES

You can't quit, you gotta voice.

People can't dig cause they don't

understand yet.

JACK

If you're an individual, if you're

too good, they wanna cut your dick

off. Look what happened to Orson

Wells.

TRICK

You quit now, they'll yank your

deferment in no time and they'll get

you for Vietnam man. Three more months

you graduate.

BONES

Be cool, you never learned fuckin

patience Morrison, you want everything

at once.

NICK

They didn't get it. So make your

films and fuck what they think.

JIM

You know what I think?

BONES

Yeah whadday you think?

JIM

You really want to know what I think?

BONES

Yeah yeah, whatddaya think?

JIM

I think we gotta get really ripped!

RAY

I tell you bout my baby 'bout five

foot four from head to toe She came

to my room Just 'bout midnight She

makes me feel so good She makes me

feel alright

JIM

You know what I'd like to do to you?

GIRL

(waiting, intrigued)

No what?

JIM

You really want to know what I'd

like to do to you?

GIRL

What!

JIM

(whispering)

Wanna hear the scream of the

butterfly...

FOOTBALL PLAYER

Hey Morrison!

JIM

(eluding the man)

Can we have a couple of beers. You're

not even an asshole man -- you're a

semihole.

JIM

(singing)

She came to my room

She came on my floor

She came on my bed

She came on my face

Ooooooh I want to wrap your legs

around my head baby baby and her

name was Gloria

JIM

(barely comprehensible)

HA HA HA HA HA! COME ON, LET'S DRIVE

TO MEXICO MAN. TIJUANA. LET'S GET

LOST!

RAY & ALL

COOL IT JIM, COME ON COOL IT.

JIM

FREEDOM!!! DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALL

SLAVES!

JOHN

HE'S GOING OUT! HE'S GOING OUT!

TRICK

HE'S GONNA JUMP!

RAY

GET HIM BACK IN!

JIM

DEATH OLD FRIEND!!

JIM

Come on, come out for a walk, it's a

pretty night.

PAM

You're crazy!

JIM

Can I stay with you tonight? We could

talk 'till dawn. I just don't want

to be alone.

PAM

(hesitant)

Okay... just talk though. No funny

stuff.

JIM

Okay. I promise.

PAM

I've been real upset. I lost my car

on the freeway yesterday. I left it

somewhere and I can't remember where

and when I went back it was gone. My

sister...

JIM

I bet you never expected life could

be this hard.

(strokes her hair

affectionately)

And you're still so young.

JIM

I wonder where we'll be ten years

from now?

PAM

I really don't want to know

JIM

Come on.

PAM

(reading, looking)

These are like beautiful! I never

read much poetry in school. I hated

it. What's a "shaman"?

(mispronounces)

JIM

He's the medicine man who starts in

a peyote trance. And he gets everyone

in the tribe going and they share in

his vision and it heals them. It's

the same in all cultures -- Greeks,

Jesus. Some Indians say the first

shaman invented sex. He's the one

who makes you crazy.

PAM

Are you a "shaman"?

JIM

Uh

(pause)

no. I just write about it. What turns

you on?

PAM

I don't know. Experience. Freedom.

Love... Now. Peyote's like love.

When it's given it's blessed. When

it's sold it's damned. I like peyote.

I like acid, it's easier to get. I

like the spiritual voyage. The first

time I did acid I saw God. I did. I

had a friend who was Christ. And he

was Judas too. I suddenly knew the

secret of everything -- that we're

all one, the universe is one. And

that everything is beautiful.

JIM

Is it? I don't know. I think you're

alive by confronting death -- by

experiencing pain.

PAM

I think you're alive by recognizing

beauty -- seeing truth because when

you discover truth you discover what

love is... we're all saying the same

thing. It's "love me and I'll love

you."

JIM

(looks at her, ironic)

It's only thru death that you know

life. Jesus, medicine men heal people

by sacrificing their own life.

PAM

Do you love Death?

JIM

I think life hurts a lot more than

death. When you die the pain is over.

PAM

Why do I look at you... and see my

death?

(pause, shrugs)

No, that's ridiculous.

JIM

I bet your dad's a school teacher.

PAM

How did you know!

JIM

I don't know.

PAM

What was your father?

JIM

Military

PAM

I bet you moved around a lot.

JIM

Yeah, about 8 times.

PAM

How many sisters and brothers?

JIM

Two.

PAM

One... she's the pretty one... I

love your neck.

(she gets in his lap)

JIM

"...but one, the most beautiful one

of all dances in a ring of fire and

throws off the challenge with a shrug"

PAM

That's beautiful. Who did you write

it for?

JIM

I wrote it for you.

PAM

...take your time, Jim... there's no

hurry, I'm all you have to do

tonight...

DISSOLVE TO:

RAY

Om om... No bliss! No bliss!

JIM

Hey Ray, try acid man, it's

guaranteed.

RAY

(surprised)

Morrison... Aw shit. Last trip I

thought I was going through hell's

digestive system. Something painted

by Hieronymus Bosch.

JIM

I never had a bummer on acid.

RAY

I like naturally high man.

JIM

Whatever works. Making movies at MGM

yet?

RAY

Well I saw the head of production

and I said Godard doesn't use scripts,

he improvises with his camera and he

said, "great who's Godard?"

JIM

(laughs)

We gotta take the planet back,

reinvent the Gods, make new myths.

RAY

Right on. I thought you went to New

York?

JIM

Never got there. Went out to the

desert and uh... got lost y'know.

Days. I been living on Trick's

rooftop. Got stuck on this chick...

RAY

Whatcha been doing?

JIM

Writing. Poems. Songs.

RAY

Songs? Lemme hear one.

JIM

I can't sing.

RAY

So neither can Dylan. "Johnny's in

the basement mixing up the medicine,

I'm on the pavement thinking about

the government". But he's got the

words man. That's what they want.

JIM

(suddenly sings)

Let's swim to the moon un hunh

Let's climb thru the tide

Penetrate the evening

That the city sleeps to hide

JIM

Let's swim out tonight love

It's our turn to try

Parked beside the ocean

On our moonlight drive

RAY

Wow!... Y'know man those are hot

lyrics -- really hot!

JIM

(pleased)

...could you write the music for

that down, if we went over to your

place, could you write that on your

organ?

RAY

Are you kidding! I could fly. You

wrote that? You got others?

JIM

A bunch. It's like I'm taking notes

at a rock concert going on inside my

head. I actually hear the music --

the spirit of the wine y'know,

intoxication.

RAY

(slaps him on the

knee)

Man. You got a voice like Chet Baker --

haunted! What the hell happened to

you in the desert? Let's get a rock

and roll band together man and make

a million bucks.

JIM

...be great wouldn't it?

RAY

(walking JIM)

It's the perfect time man! Two of

the guys outta my band are really

into this. I meditate with them. You

know them... Robbie and John. We

could have it in the can in three

weeks.

JIM

Hey why not, I could write the songs

with you guys.

RAY

The Stones did it outta the London

School of Economics for Chrissake.

Things are about to explode man. You

can feel it in the air.

(points out over the

ocean)

Vietnam's right out there. Sides are

being chosen. People wanna fight or

fuck, love or kill, everything's

gonna flame. The planet's screaming

for change, Morrison. Make the myths

man!!

JIM

There oughta be great orgies man.

Like when Dionysus arrived in Greece,

he made all the women mad, leaving

their homes and dancing off in the

mountains. Great golden copulations

in the streets of LA.

(looks at a passing

girl)

Hey, do you know her?

RAY

What do we call ourselves. "Dionysus"?

JIM

I got a name.

RAY

What?

JIM

The Doors.

RAY

The Doors?

(facial distaste)

That's the most ridiculous...

(then)

...you mean the doors in your mind?

Like the Huxley book.

JIM

"The Doors of Perception"? Acid...

RAY

Yeah sure mescaline experiments --

reducing the sugar flow to the brain.

Great book.

JIM

It's from William Blake actually,

the line -- "when the doors of

perception are cleansed -- things

will appear as they truly are..."

RAY

(finishes)

-- infinite". It's great, Jim.

JIM

So where do we start? How do we start?

Where are the girls?

RAY

Rehearsing. You're moving off the

rooftop and in with me and Dorothy.

DISSOLVING TO:

JIM & DOORS

(live)

The day destroys the night

Night divides the day

Tried to run

Tried to hide

Break on thru to the other side

JOHN

That's really square. Let's hip it

up. Jump on your cues.

RAY

Tighten it up. Stay with the beat

Jim. You're dragging.

JIM

Let's try it again, come on. I'm

just getting into it.

PAM

(on floor)

I think it's hot!!

ROBBIE

(strumming)

I still think the lyrics are weird

man.

JOHN

(frustrated)

I still think it sounds like the

bottom of a fishbowl man.

JIM

(to Robbie, aggravated)

Then you write one man! We need more

songs anyway. We all gotta go back

and write.

ROBBIE

I been working on something goes

like this... A minor.

(chords his guitar)

"You know that it would be untrue

You know that I would be a liar

If I was to say to you

Girl, we couldn't get much higher"

F sharp... chorus

"Come on baby, light my fire

Try to set the night on fire..."

RAY

Okay man there's some good changes

in there.

JIM

Got any more lyrics?

ROBBIE

(gives Jim a page of

lyrics)

Some. I call it "Light My Fire". I

figger if I'm gonna compete with

your stuff it's gotta be about earth,

fire or snakes.

JIM

Don't underestimate Death.

JOHN

Yeah but it sounds like the Byrds

man, we're not folk rock man. How

'bout trying it with a Latin beat.

ROBBIE

I thought we could do the usual verse

chorus verse chorus and

JOHN

We don't need a bridge.

ROBBIE

Yeah, we could maybe improvise a

couple piano and guitar solos over

it

(kicks in second verse)

"The time to hesitate is through"

(doesn't have the

second line)

Du du duh dud dada . . .

JIM

(spontaneous)

"No time to wallow in the mire

Try now we can only lose

And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on baby light my fire"

JIM

Pretty good! Pretty neat!!

RAY

(to John)

Nice groove, John. Chaka chaka chaka,

then bula burump bula

(to Robbie)

...you're right, it could take a

coupla long solos, that's wild man,

like Butterfield did on "East-West" --

really hip.

ROBBIE

Y'ever heard Coltrane's "Favorite

Things"?

JOHN

(hitting the drums)

Yeah -- maybe stretch it out and put

it in 4/4 on bass, 3/4 on guitar and

snare.

RAY

(clicking, excited)

Why not! A minor to B minor. Jazz!

That then is jazz! But it needs a

hook. Something. Give me some space.

I need some space. Leave the room

guys. Come on! Go!

JOHN

(irritated at Ray)

Guy's obnoxious, man always bossin'

people around! I thought we were

equals!

JIM

Aren't we?

(to Robbie)

That was great Robbie. Whaddaya

thinking about when you play?

ROBBIE

Don't know. Mostly the fish in my

fish tank.

JIM

(laughs)

Hey whadya say we take some of that

Tijuana acid and see what kinda

trouble we can get into tonight?

ROBBIE

The chicks always go for you man. I

get the dogs.

JIM

Then we'll start a religion or plan

a murder or go to Tijuana.

JOHN

Whatsamatter with you man, what about

Pam, you got the morals of a coyote.

JIM

Why you wanna sleep with her John,

just to bug me?

JOHN

Hell NO!

JIM

...means "hell yes". She likes you

man, she really does and y'all should.

What's a rock and roll band for man,

if you can't party all night and do

bad things?

RAY

(yelling from the

house)

I GOT IT I GOT IT... GET IN HERE.

HURRY.

JOHN

Sieg Heil!

RAY

Okay here it is. Bach and Rock. Count

it off John

JOHN

(clicking)

1... 2... 1 - 2 - 3

(crack)

JIM VOICE

(last session)

The music was new black polished

chrome and came over the summer like

liquid night.

GIRL GROUPIE

(approaching, to 2nd

girl)

Is that horny motherfucker in the

black pants here tonight?

BOUNCER

IDs! IDs! Can't get in without an

I.D..

GIRL 2

Oh please. I forgot my I.D.. I'm on

the list.

BOUNCER

I forgot my list.

JIM & DOORS

(live)

We chased our pleasures here

Dug our treasures there

Can you still recall the time we

cried

BREAK on through to the other side

(3)

RAY

Turn around Jim! Come on let 'em in.

JIM

I found an island in your arms

A country in your eyes

Arms that chained us, eyes that lied

(CHORUS)

PAM

(innocently)

So Jerry... do we get paid for this?

JERRY

(ignoring her)

What shit, "day destroys the night",

"crawl back in your brain", "go

insane". What do people wanna pay

money to hear that shit.

JIM

(explains it, gentle)

The greater the suffering, the more

terrible the events, the greater the

pleasure Jerry. They want it, it's

catharsis. Like the ancient Greeks.

JERRY

(amused)

We're in Los Angeles punk, how would

you know, they like your pants,

they're not listenin' to you, what

the hell they see in you I...

JIM

(laughs)

But they understand Jerry. All our

real desires are unconscious and

unseen. . .

JERRY

(scratching his head)

...you're the weirdest fuckin' guy I

ever...

JIM

You love us?

JERRY

I love ya. You got two more shows to

do.

MANAGER

...I got some real tight record

company connections, just leave it

to me man, I'll take you guys all

the fuckin' way, you blew my mind

out there.

RAY

Yeah right, but what about the music?

MANAGER

Hey the music? I love it man, that's

why we're talking right? Some of

it's a little on the dark side though.

Ya know ya oughta get some tunes

like Herman's Hermits stuff -- "Mrs.

Brown you got a lovely daughter".

That shit goes right to the radio

man.

RAY

Uh huh. Well, how 'bout gettin' us

some real equipment?

MANAGER

Listen, I sign you guys to a five

year management contract and you got

it all. Equipment. Demo. A truck

WITH roadies. Three, maybe four

percent record deal. Wherever ya

want to go babe, trust me, I'll get

you there. Whatd'ya say?

RAY

(exchanging looks

with John)

We'll have a band meeting. The four

of us do everything unanimously or

we don't do it.

MANAGER

The musketeers. I'm touched. But

lemme tell you something -- loyalty

don't pay the bills. Think about it.

Call me tomorrow.

JOHN

(to Ray)

What a sleaze! Man, Jim's gotta start

facing the crowd if he's gonna be

the front man.

RAY

He's just getting his confidence.

JOHN

He never does what we rehearsed.

What's the point of...

RAY

How does it feel?

JOHN

Great, but...

PAM

...make sure you get Barb and Sue

Anne to come. And tell them to ask

for Jim!

MANAGER

Jim, how old are you?

JIM

Ah, twenty one...

MANAGER

Jesus, you're a gold mine, I'll make

it quick and to the point and if you

repeat it I'll deny it -- drop these

guys, I'll put you with some real

musicians, your voice, your looks,

that's what'll sell records, we'll

make a million bucks. A year. Goodbye.

Call me. I'm right. He gives Jim a

card and goes. Pam disgusted with

the type, Jim laughs, likes the guy.

JIM

I like a man wears his soul on his

face.

RAY

(coming over)

"Whiskey's" next, I can feel it in

my bones.

ROBBIE

I still think the lyrics are weird.

JIM

(to Ray, innocently)

Jesus Ray, every girl out there wanted

to fuck me, I could feel it for the

first time!

RAY

Right on stud. But you better watch

out for the guys.

JIM

(to the band)

Guys, I'm serious about the desert,

we still gotta deepen man, we gotta

take some peyote -- all of us

together, we got one more stage to

go...

ROBBIE

I don't know man, fucks up my playing.

I been playing music for 10 years

man and this is the first time in my

whole damned life I ever played it.

JIM

Are you satisfied?

JOHN

Will you get off my case! I'm never

doing acid again. Too many bad trips

man.

JIM

It's not acid John, it's peyote.

It's a bonding ceremony. It's got to

be more... more... more...

JOHN

I'm into TM man. I promised my guru...

PAM

I want to! I want to! I'm ready.

Let's go to the desert... do the

peyote, the good peyote.

JIM

(to girl in line)

Who's on now?

GIRL 1

(withering look, very

hip)

"Love".

JIM

Yeah, Arthur Lee's cool.

GIRL 1

They're the best... better'n the

Beatles.

JIM

You mean the Marx Brothers of music,

we could blow 'em away.

GIRL 2

And who are you?

JIM

The Doors... We're up the street at

the Fog.

GIRL 1

(contempt)

The Doors. I heard of you. That's

the dumbest name. I wouldn't go to

the Fog if you paid me.

JIM

Oh yeah what would you do for money?

PAM

Let's go Jim, come on.

JOHN

So you don't have a phone number?

What do you mean you don't have a

phone number?

GIRL 2

I don't have a phone number. So give

me your number then.

JOHN

I don't have a phone.

GIRL 1

(intrigued, to Jim)

Well, would you leave my name at the

door?

JIM

Well I don't know. What's your name?

GIRL 1

Caprice.

JIM

Caprice? That's the dumbest name I

ever heard.

JIM

Hey! I am the Lizard king. I can do

Anything! Raise your hands if you

understand! Alive, any of you alive --

let's take a poll -- how many of you

know you're really alive!!

JIM

No one? Raise your hands c'mon man...

let's go.

JIM

Everybody having a good time?

JIM

...awright, pretty good, it gets

better.

JIM

WOA!! It's fast.

JIM

When the serpent appears, his head

is ten feet long and five feet wide.

He has one red eye and one green

eye. He's deadly and he's seven miles

long. As he moves -- on his scales

is written all the history of the

world, all people, all actions, all

of us our little pictures on the

scales, God it's big! -- and it's

eating as it moves all the time,

devouring, digesting consciousness,

power, a monster of energy!

JIM

We must kiss the snake on the tongue,

if it senses our fear, it will eat

us instantly. But if we kiss it

without fear, the snake will take us

through the garden and out the gate.

To our freedom -we must ride this

snake. To the end of time.

JOHN

I think I'm fucked up. I'm not

thinking right.

JIM

You're fucked up John. Go with it,

confusion is the sound of creation.

JOHN

You should see your eyes right now,

you're death. Look at your eyes --

you're crazy man, you look crazy.

You scare me.

JIM

No no no John John. God is crazy

too. God is part insane as well as

sane. Not in control all the time.

Dionysus was the God of the wine. He

made ecstasy but he also made madness.

Madness is all right. That's what

you want, isn't it, isn't it? Where's

that joint?

ROBBIE

(crying)

I get scared thinking of all the

choices inside. I could go. I could

stay. I can live anywhere. I could

die now if I wanted. It's limitless

choice... and no one cares.

JIM

Die Robbie.

JOHN

What the fuck!

PAM

(wandering in)

I don't know what I am. I'm on the

cusp of Sagittarius and Capricorn.

Sagittarius is wild and Capricorn

domestic and safe, so I don't know

which one to be.

JIM

I love you.

DOROTHY

(into the same lens)

Oh my God, the light, it's so

beautiful Ray. Can you see it...

it's all one... honey?

RAY

I'm in pain man. I want something

from the peyote. I feel the universe

functioning perfectly but I'm still

perfectly locked inside myself.

Instead of Oneness, I feel total

Isolation. Aloneness. Fear... Pain...

Jim, all I feel is pain.

JIM

Pain makes me feel more alive Ray.

Pain is meant to wake us up. People

try to hide their pain but they're

wrong.

JOHN

I feel Lust. I want to fuck everything

I can, and I know it will never be

enough.

JIM

(whispers)

Pam wants you.

(normal)

You're a good Catholic John, you

want it so you can feel guilty about

it... Fuck death away John.

ROBBIE

I feel Fear... so bad I just numb

out all my feelings. I'm afraid of

my father, I'm afraid of Yahweh... I

wish I could play my guitar.

JIM

Maybe you should kill your father

Robbie. He tried to kill you. Kill

him!

ROBBIE

I'm so fucking scared.

JIM

But you're Alive! It's beautiful!

Fear, pain, lust, we've got to know

all our feelings before we can come

out the other side free men. Don't

feel ashamed of yourselves, don't

let society destroy your reality.

Our freedom's the only thing worth

dying for, it's the only thing worth

living for!

JOHN

(cold sweats)

I'm not gonna make it man. I'm scared

Jim, I'm still scared. Blindness is

coming on.

JIM

Then use us John, use our strength,

it's us four now, a tribe of warriors,

everything we have comes from the

same source, the great Creator of

Being. Trust him, trust us. Ride the

snake. . . I promise you I will be

with you till the end of time.

JIM

My wild love went riding... mmmmmm.

She rode all the day. She ride to

the devil. And ask for him to pay...

shooo shoooo

JIM

(ad lib)

...she went to the desert she went

to the sea Joseph we did see...

JIM

(to himself)

...I'm lying to you. I am scared.

JOHN

Jim, where are you going.

JIM

(looking back)

I'll be back. I gotta go alone.

PAM

Jim! Jim... come here, dance... don't

go away.

INDIAN GHOST VOICE

...you are a prince among white men,

yet you are a warrior among us. You

are ready now. Go out "walk with the

pain of the world, travel to the end

of the wind" -- and change it for

all men as you were born to do.

MATCH CUT TO:

JIM & DOORS

Get here and we'll do the rest

The blue bus is calling us (2)

Driver where you taking us?

JIM

The killer awoke before dawn

He put his boots on

He took a face from the ancient

gallery

And he walked on down the hall

JIM

He went to the room where his sister

lived

And he paid a visit to his brother

And then he went on down the hall...

JIM

And he came to a door, And he looked

inside "Father?" "Yes, son?" "I want

to kill you".

JIM

Mother... I want to...

JIM

I'm into!

JERRY

twisted perverse punk, get back to

JIM

(calmly smiling)

You have the face of a pig man.

RAY

Oedipus! GREEK TRAGEDY!! It's ART!!

JERRY

FUCK ART!! GET THE FUCK ART OUT!!!

JOURNALIST

NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THE DOORS --

JIM

FUTURE. WE ARE THINGS TO COME.

JERRY

FUCK YOU... YOU'RE FUCKING DEAD!

PAUL

Come on Jerry, cool it, cool it...

he's a kid, it's a song about dying,

changing...

JOHN

(to RAY and ROBBIE)

We'll never work again man. The Mafia

controls all these clubs.

HOLZMAN

(to Ray and Robbie)

Quite a night! Hi, I'm Jac Holzman.

I own Elektra Records.

RAY

(knows the name)

Oh sure, hi.

HOLZMAN

Listen... I think if you could just

put what you did in there on record,

we could really have something...

and we could make a lot of money...

RAY

Yeah?

HOLZMAN

(pointing to ROTHCHILD

coming up)

Yeah... and Rothchild here was born

to be your producer.

ROBBIE

(recognizing Paul)

Hey, the guy that did Butterfield!

PAUL

Bertold Brecht, cabaret and rock.

Give me a fucking break. You guys

are amazing! Let's go make a record.

JIM

(to Ray, pointing

back at Jerry)

Hey, is that asshole gonna pay us?

HOLZMAN

(amused)

Why don't you go inside and ask him

Jim?

PAUL

Hey Bruce, you feel it?

BRUCE

I'm having big fun.

PAUL

(to Jac)

I got goosebumps Jac. This is history

going down here. An album of killer

music in six days... six days...

unreal!

JIM

Come on baby, LIGHT MY FIIIRRRREEEE!!!

JIM

(after song)

Pretty good! Pretty neat!

JIM

(singing)

The time to hesitate is through

No time to wallow in the mire.

JIM

Try now we can only lose

And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on baby, light my fire

Try to set the night on

FIIIIIIIIIRE!!!!!

JIM

(real close, hugging

her)

I don't mind dying in a plane crash,

a smile on my face.

PAMELA

(cutting his food)

As compared to what?

JIM

I just don't want to go out slow --

brain tumor, botulism. I want to

feel what it's like, cause death is

only going to happen to you once.

PAMELA

I don't want to die ever, what a

weird thing to say.

GIRLS

(faint)

Oh Jimmmmm, pleeeaaase look, I looove

youuuuu, Jimmmmmm, pleeeeeaase,

Jimmmmm, here, sign miiiine... take

a picture Jim?... Jim, Jim, oh please

look at me Jim!!

PRODUCER

Right this way Mr. Sullivan. They're

called "the Doors". They got the

number one single in the country --

"Light Your Fire".

SULLIVAN

"Light Your Fire"? Is that sooo?

PRODUCER

They look pretty grungy but we're...

JOHN

(indignant)

You're gonna cut it!

HAIRDRESSER

(doing John)

No, I'm going to worship it. What

kind of shampoo are you using?

JOHN

The kind you get in hotels.

HAIRDRESSER

Pamper yourself sweetheart, you don't

want split ends, you're a celebrity

now.

(moving to Ray)

You have very serious-serious hair,

it needs to rebel. I'll give it a

tinge of something freaky.

RAY

I'd rather stay the same color.

HAIRDRESSER

Scaredy cat.

ROBBIE

What about me?

HAIRDRESSER

(a look)

Honey, we don't have enough time.

TV NEWSMAN

...here in Detroit, 42 people dead,

more than 2000 injured... 1400

buildings burned, 5000 people have

just lost their homes as Detroit

joins more than 100 cities torn by

riots this hot summer!

JIM

No wonder "Light My Fire's" number

one.

HAIRDRESSER

(to JIM)

What about you handsome?

JIM

(friendly)

The biggest mistakes in my life have

been haircuts.

PAM

Don't wash it. Don't set it. He likes

it the way it is...

HAIRDRESSER

(backing off)

All right, be mean...

PRODUCER

Boys -- meet Mr. Sullivan

SULLIVAN

Hi boys, heard your song "Light That

Fire"

(Herb corrects)

...think you're great... good luck

out there.

DOORS

(ad lib)

Oh thanks Mr. Sullivan.

PRODUCER

(moving alongside Ray)

Well the guys at Network have told

us they have a small problem with

the lyrics "girl we couldn't get

much higher". You can't say "higher"

on network so they asked if... you

could say, "girl we can't get much

better"... can you dig that?

JIM

How 'bout, "girl you couldn't bite

my wire".

PRODUCER

I don't think Standards and Practices

would...

SULLIVAN

Look, you boys don't forget to smile

now. Don't be so sullen out there...

JIM

Uh well, we're kind of a sullen group,

Ed.

SIDDONS

We'll work it out Herb, promise.

Give me five.

PRODUCER

(not totally convinced,

exiting)

Groovy! Uh you boys should know Mr.

Sullivan is considering you boys for

four more shows. You dig?

JOHN

Well?

JIM

What -- are we the Beatles now John?

RAY

(laughs)

It's only a word man. The Stones

changed...

JIM

Hey Ray, why don't you change your

name to Sid or Irving Manzarek or

something... it's only a word y'know.

ROBBIE

It's my words. I don't care, let's

just jam.

SULLIVAN

Now here on our stage direct from

Los Angeles, California, ladies and

gentlemen, The Doors!

PRODUCER

(in control booth)

What's that?... oh Jesus!... get off

it!! Where's he going?

JIM & DOORS

You know that it would be untrue

You know that I would be a liar

If I was to say to you

Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Come on baby light my fire

PRODUCER

(hyperventilating)

He said it! He said it! On National

TV You can't do that! You can't do

that!!! You blew it you little shit!

You'll never play Ed Sullivan again.

JIM

Come on baby, light my fire

Try to set the night on FIIIIRRRRRE!

PAM

(tender)

What can I do, what do you want me

to do?... Jim?

JIM

I don't know... I guess I should see

a doctor or something... maybe I

should go to someone of the straight

Jungian philosophy.

PAM

It happens to other guys too...

JIM

It's so scary up there. To be adored.

Isn't that irony? Teenage death girls

want my dick -- a mere clown -- not

my words. I'll never wake up in a

good mood again... Lament for my

cock, a tongue of knowledge deep in

the feathered night, gives life,

soar and crucify, I seek to know

you...

PAM

It's not so complicated Jim, it's

just sex, y'know.

JIM

You should marry an insurance

salesman.

PAM

It's the hours man, the pressure,

everything's like your last

performance, you're setting yourself

up.

JIM

We weren't built to last.

PAM

Aren't you doing this for you, because

you're a poet, not a rock star. Ed

Sullivan's not a place for you.

JIM

You really know what I am Pam? You

know what poetry is? Where is the

feast they promised us? Where is the

wine -- the new wine -- dying on the

vine?

PAM

What are you saying!

JIM

Y'see -- I lied to you. I really

love Fame.

PAM

(Here we go)

Why are you doing this to me?

JIM

(drinks)

'Cause you're in the room.

PAM

And this is gonna help! It's probably

the cause. 'Least put some soul in

your success asshole!

JIM

Maybe you're the cause!

PAM

Right.

JIM

I mean I don't have this problem

with anybody else.

PAM

(getting the bottle)

Give it to me!!!

JIM

(getting it back)

No!!!!! Mommy!!!

PAM

(gives up, tries to

exit)

Fuck you man I'm outta here.

JIM

(excited now)

Get mad! Yeahhh! Love my girl! Yeah,

go fuck the other guys. How many

white guys have you fucked Pam? 10,

20? Black guys what? You like Chinese

dicks? Mongolian penis? 30?

PAM

(fighting)

...how many dogs have you fucked!

You don't say No to anybody! Drugs,

dogs, uglies, you'd fuck a doorknob

with butter on it!

JIM

How could I do that

PAM

(shouting top of her

lungs)

You're the first one who couldn't

make it with me anyway! You're the

only limp dick in the lot!!!

JIM

HA HA HA!! WILL YOU DIE FOR ME!

PAM

NO! WILL YOU DIE FOR ME!!

JIM

I'D DIE FOR ANYBODY.

PAM

WHAT ABOUT ME! WHAT ABOUT ME!

JIM

CUNT CUNT CUNT.

PAM

LIAR LIAR LIAR. YOU PROMISED. YOU

PROMISED.

JIM

I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M SORRY.

VOICE

SHADDUP WILLYA. I'M TRYING TO

SLEEP!!!!

JIM

THEN MOVE TO MIAMI YOU SLAVE!!!

JIM

(quietly)

You were saying?

JIM

(low)

...will you die for me, Pam, a clown,

a despicable clown?... a mere

despicable clown?

PAM

Yes yes yes.

JIM

...I need a home. A place to hide.

PAM

...with me. Yes... yes...

JIM

(mumbling)

...how could we make a home?... where

there's sanctuary?

PAM

...yes, yes, yes.

JIM

...we're in Africa, we're just

animals... I wanna stay inside you

all night baby... let's fuck death

away, now fuck death away...

PAM

...yes...

JOURNALIST 1

(stiff, Times type)

What are your songs about Mr.

Morrison?

JIM

Uh love death travel... revolt. We

all write the songs, we're interested

in anything about disorder, chaos,

especially activity which seems to

have no meaning... I think when you

make peace with authority, you become

authority.

JOURNALIST 1

Can you define that a little more?

JIM

Yeah you can call us erotic

politicians I guess.

DISSOLVING OVER:

JOURNALIST 2

Do you really consider yourself a

shaman Mr. Morrison?

DISSOLVING OVER:

JIM

...a scapegoat maybe -- I take on

the audiences' fantasies, obeying

their impulses. When the impulses

are destructive, I'm destructive.

It's kinda like sucking the puss out

of a rattlesnake, something like

that.

JOURNALIST 1

(smiling)

...like a medicine man or witch

doctor?

RAY

(cuts in)

Jim said to me once, the history of

rock and roll's like Greek drama or

caveman stories. The audience comes

to see ancient rituals in ancient

caves. Their souls in jeopardy.

They're not watching any longer,

they're participating -- and

everything's in play, your life,

your death...

JOURNALIST 1

(glib)

Is that why they scream so much?

DISSOLVING TO:

JOURNALIST 3

(more down to earth)

Mr. Morrison, how do you feel about

being called the "ultimate barbie

doll".

JIM

I guess when you say something like

that, it's a shortcut to thinking.

JOURNALIST 3

Then do you "think" about the dreadful

reviews your new poetry book has

gotten?

JIM

(softly)

I guess they didn't understand.

JOURNALIST 3

(having scored)

And it's true you financed it's

publication?

RAY

(angry)

Have you bothered to read the poetry

ma'm? You keep denying that anything

good can come from L.A., I mean isn't

that kind of a provincial attitude?

That Bob Dylan's the only poet cause

he's from the East Coast, but you

won't even look past Jim's goddamn

looks at the words man!

JIM

(embarrassed)

Hey c'mon Ray, hate should be allowed.

JOURNALIST 1

...but what really are your songs

about Mr. Morrison? You preach,

"saving the planet", "making a new

age" but how does drinking, taking

drugs, this boozy sort of apocalyptic

stance at the world influence young

people in a positive way?

JIM

I like that -- "boozy apocalyptic" --

you're a word man, but how does your

newspaper influence young people to

think about Vietnam? Who's sending

the soldiers over there to die? The

establishment -- right? Your newspaper --

right? That seems to me a lot more

dangerous than the stuff we do.

DISSOLVING OVER:

JOURNALIST 3

Do you believe in drugs Mr. Morrison?

JIM

(graciously disdainful)

Did you know Nietzsche said, "all

good consciousness, all evidence of

truth comes only from the senses"?

Hey you wanna arm wrestle? Come on,

you look pretty tough today. C'mon,

I'll take you all on.

JOURNALIST 3

(ignoring his smile)

And alcohol? Is that considered part

of the shaman's wisdom?

JIM

Part of the clown's wisdom -- it's

kinda the American way. You know we

spend more on alcohol and tobacco

than on education.

JOURNALIST 3

Are you by any chance in a trance

now Mr. Morrison?

JIM

Do you hurt?

JOURNALIST 3

What?

JIM

What hurts you the most?

JOURNALIST 3

What are you doing?

DISSOLVING OVER:

JIM

Uh... got tired of the barbie doll

look. It hurt.

JOURNALIST 3

Are you serious?

JIM

(cutting hair blindly)

About? Y'know when people are joking,

I find they are dead serious and

when they're dead serious, I find

them funny.

JOURNALIST 4

What do your parents think about

what you are doing?

JIM

(pause)

Actually, I don't really remember

being born. It musta happened during

one of my blackouts.

JOURNALIST 4

But they must've expressed some

feeling?

JIM

(pause)

Well, to be honest they're not living

anymore so I don't like to talk about

that.

JOURNALIST 4

Could you at least tell us how they

died?

JIM

Oh, it was a... horrible car crash...

in the desert in the fifties,

Arizona... ran right into a truckload

of Indians... Navajos, they were

lying out on the road, all bleeding,

and I was with my Grandma and Grandad,

we were banged up and all... and I

was looking at my Dad and he was

lying there... but his throat was

severed and there was air coming

out.

JOURNALIST 4

I'm sorry.

JOURNALIST 2

I have the feeling I'm being put on.

JIM

Y'all believe what you want to

believe, you will anyway... but it

does kinda show you what excites

people?

(looking directly at

her)

Fear, pity, horror -- all those good

things that count. It's sorta I guess

like being on the edge of an orgasm,

y'know... that mystery just before

you come. When? If? Should I? Will

you die for me, eat me, this way,

the end...

PATRICIA

You want to do some more cocaine?

It'll loosen you up.

JIM

Great! A new thing.

JIM

Wow how old is this?

PATRICIA

(snorting)

14th Century. I practice the Craft.

JIM

The Craft?

PATRICIA

I'm a witch

(smiles)

A white one.

JIM

(impressed)

Wow! You Patricia? Who would've

guessed?

PATRICIA

The Kennealy's were Celtic cheiftains

and pre-Christian shamans when your

Druid ancestors the Morrisons were a

minor Scottish clan founded by a

bastard son of the king of Norway.

PATRICIA

It's a religion, witchcraft. Witches

are the protectors of the seasons,

the harvests, goddesses of the grain.

And when crossed, destroyers.

PATRICIA

You ever try drinking blood?

JIM

What?

PATRICIA

It works you know. You drink blood

the right time of the moon... they

used to dance in the forests naked.

I think that's what offended the

Puritans and led to the Burnings.

They were a sexual threat to their

male order like the Bacchae -- five

days a year for Dionysus, they used

to wander the hills in ancient Greece,

the first witches, clans of wild

women fucking, looting, eating animals

raw, the wine in their blood running

hot -- looking for Dionysus... to

tear him to pieces -- isn't that

wild?

JIM

(hooked)

Where do you get the blood?

SUPERIMPOSITION TO:

PATRICIA

Blood is the rose of mysterious union,

symbol of potency... now you.

JIM

No... I don't like... cutting myself.

PATRICIA

(stern)

Don't be such a child! If I do it,

you have to do it.

SUPERIMPOSITIONS:

SUPERIMPOSITIONS TO:

PATRICIA

(sexy)

Come on rock god, fuck me, fuck me

good.

JIM

(lips out of sync)

I'm gonna burn you down.

PATRICIA

Come on...

PATRICIA

Cut me! Cut me go on!

JIM

(knife to her cheek)

Nobody'd ever look at you again --

'cept me. I'd scar you forever.

PATRICIA

Yeah YEAH!

JIM

AWRIGHT! AWRIGHT!

PATRICIA

FUCK ME! FUCK ME!! GO ON FUCK ME!!!

DISSOLVE TO:

GLORIA

Take off your shirt.

JIM

(cow noise)

Mooooooo!!!

GLORIA

(taking his shirt off)

You remind me of a Russian peasant.

I see you standing in a wheat field.

The pride, the arrogance. You love

to look at yourself don't you. You

love yourself.

(he's moving, getting

into it)

...good... big cat stalking...

GLORIA

...the camera is like a roulette

wheel Jim. It becomes whoever you

want it to be -- a woman you want to

seduce, a man you want to kill, a

mother you want to upset, a wife you

want to lie to or love, whatever you

want it to be, it is...

JIM

(pausey, paranoid)

Where are the Doors.

GLORIA

Forget the Doors. It's you they want,

Jim. You're the Doors.

JIM

(scared suddenly)

We do everything together.

GLORIA

You control the audience, like dogs,

manipulate them Jim, one picture can

control a million people, be anything

you want -- growl at them, be ugly,

be frightened, be selfish. Be man,

woman, whild, animal. Live, die,

return again. Anything you want.

Everything is permitted.

GLORIA

Go on look at yourself, fall in love

with yourself. You're your own

audience now Jim. They want you.

Worship and love and adore you...

GLORIA

...Jim Morrison, the god of Rock and

Cock...

JIM

I am the snake and you are the lute

GLORIA

Exactly...

PR MAN

(cool)

You must meet Andy Warhol, Jim. He's

more than an artist. Andy is art.

Bright people in America wonder --

does Andy imitate life, or does life

imitate Andy. The meeting of two

kings. Yes, Come.

PAMELA

Oh Jim this is Tom... Baker, he's an

actor, he was in Andy's movie and

this is Count Ruspoli. He lives in

Paris, but he's Italian. He's from a

very famous family over there. They're

seven hundred years old.

COUNT

(Italian accent)

Hi Jim, you are great... I see you

at Ondine's with Bobby and Jimmy.

It...

PAM

(pawing at Jim)

Don't you like the way he talks.

Isn't he cool?

JIM

(annoyed with Pam)

Yeah... hey what's your trip?

TOM

(cutting in)

Saw your gig at 'The Scene'. Hot...

very hot... You strung out? Here.

Try this.

(pill, popper, joint,

a drink, all at once)

JIM

Love your movies man. What a great

penis...

RAY

Come on, we're splitting man.

Dorothy's waiting at the door. We'll

get a bite at Max's and...

JIM

You can't leave. Where's your will

to be weird man?

JOHN

Get outta here man. This is fucking

weird man.

PR MAN

Right this way Jim. Andy's in the

bedroom.

JIM

(to RAY)

Don't go, y'see Norman Mailer, I

hear he's here?

RAY

Yeah can we meet him, he's great...

just like he is.

(enamored)

You wanna meet him?

JIM

(paranoid)

I don't know... did he know who you

were?

RAY

Yeah sure, he's cool, come on, he's

your hero!

JIM

Nah... later...

EDIE

(echoey voice)

Hey Jim, this is Jake Johnson, you

remember Jake Johnson -- the

astronaut, he's just got back from

outer space.

JAKE JOHNSON

I like the Doors, I like the Doors,

I like the Doors.

JIM

I like outer space.

TOM

Hey where's my joint?

(a roach goes back)

There's this chick sings with the

Velvet Underground, Andy's band. She

says she can drink you under the

table.

NICO

I'm Nico. It's boring tonight. Some

of us are going downtown to a new

club. You want to come?

TOM

(distantly heard)

...elevate your taste in trolls man.

JIM

(to Nico who reaches

for her vodka)

Vodka? Race you.

NICO

Your death...

JIM

(to Ray and Robbie)

Wanna go?... Come on let's go.

ROBBIE

She looks too freaky to me.

NICO

Wait just a minute.

JIM

Come on there's pussy Robbie.

ROBBIE

(excited)

Hey I met this chick Lynne, she wants

to be alone.

RAY

Come on Jim, let's go.

JIM

(childlike)

Don't you guys wanna meet Andy Warhol?

JOHN

Tell you the truth, I can live without

him. He's a freak. Let's get outta

here. We got a show tomorrow.

JIM

Come on man! I thought we were gonna

be a band, the four of us -- and

party all night, rock and roll!

RAY

(laughs)

I could never keep up with you Jim.

I couldn't make the music.

JIM

(desperate mockery,

grabs Ray)

Don't go. Don't leave! You can't

leave. I don't know what will happen.

It might be Death.

RAY

Come on Jim, this isn't our scene,

these people are vampires. We gotta

stick together man, the four of us.

Let's make the myths man.

PR MAN

Right here Jim, right here. Andy's

waiting. You know what you have in

common is uniqueness.

JIM

(looking for Nico)

Nico!

WARHOL

Well, it was such a big opening, we

just had to go to Philadelphia,

y'know, you were supposed to, mmm...

PR GUY

(butting in)

Andy! Andy!

ANDY

...but so many people showed up, the

paintings were getting crushed, so

they took them all down... um, it

really looked great y'know... maybe

uhhh...

(long pause)

PR MAN

(cutting in)

...the walls. The blank walls. Andy

was the art. Should do a show. Just

walls. Today it's really about people,

not what they do. It's the astronaut

that matters, not the voyage, the

actor, not the movie -- how do I

say, it's the trip, not arriving.

PR MAN

(babbling on)

...you know what Andy says, some day

everybody's gonna be famous for 15

seconds, but it won't mean anything.

BAKER

That's too short. I need a coupla

hours.

ANDY

We'd just love to have you in our

movies Jim, you're so beautiful,

you'd be so good, you mmmm, here...

this is for you Jim.

ANDY

Edie gave this to me and said mmmmm,

I could talk to God with this. But I

don't really have anything to say.

So... mmmm now you can talk to God.

Oh hi!

NICO

Morrison!

TECHIE

(at mike)

Testing one-two-three. Testing.

PROMOTER

(on mike)

Look, the Fire Marshall's not gonna

let the show go on. Either you go

back to your seats, you go to the

aisle, you don't do that -- no show!

CROWD

(pushing towards stage,

no aisles)

DOORS! DOORS! DOORS!

(turning to)

MORRISON! MORRISON! MORRISON!

JIM

"Lord Byron"? Really. You think? You

like the poems?

PATRICIA

Like? I loved them! "Mad bad and

dangerous to know." That's what they

said about him. Your poems should be

taken as seriously.

JIM

These are the kindest words I've

ever heard in my life. No one has

ever understood. Thank you.

(then)

Maybe I should always fuck my critics.

PATRICIA

Y'know I don't even like rockers.

They're sleazy. I made up my fuck

list the other night -- out of 30

guys there were maybe three of them,

y'know. I'm not a groupie.

JIM

(hotter, grabs her)

Let's do it, here, now... with the

sound of the crowd. Like Nuremberg,

wild German fucking.

PATRICIA

You like that hunh? Beg!

JIM

I'm begging! I'm begging you!

PATRICIA

You wanna fuck me, Morrison, don't

ever lie to me again. Ever!

JIM

About what!

PATRICIA

Your father. Why do you tell me

bullshit like your father's dead?

JIM

(pissed)

What's your problem with fathers!

They're dead, both of them, I told

you.

PATRICIA

If he's so dead, then who answered

the phone when I called the house?

PATRICIA

(knowing look)

You didn't really think you'd get

away with that, Morrison. An Admiral

in the United States Navy. Who's at

the Gulf of Tonkin when Vietnam

starts. Your Dad's a Deputy Chief of

Operations.

JIM

What'd he say? That was really stupid.

Why didn't you just ask me.

PATRICIA

Well naturally he wasn't too happy

when I called. Your Mom wanted to

talk but he shut her off.

JIM

You're a fuckin' cunt. You could

ruin his career if...

PATRICIA

What, I'm a "fuckin' cunt" because I

called the house? Like it's hard to

trace your school records. University

of Florida, Albuquerque, New Mexico,

Arlington, Virginia, Washington,

D.C. Brother, sister, it's seven

miles long baby -- it's all in the

"The End", it's so easy.

PATRICIA

Don't ever try to hide anything from

me again. Okay? Go on... tell me.

Did he make you cut your hair? Did

he hit you, was he a bully? Did he

love you? How much?

PATRICIA

And your mother?

JIM

(pause)

I don't want to talk about it. Hate

is a very underestimated emotion.

PATRICIA

It doesn't matter anymore does it.

Listen to them. It's you they want

now. Not the Doors, not your mother

or your father's child... They want

you Jim.

JIM

You're wrong. What they want I can't

give... my death -- ripped to pieces --

do you feel their power?

(the noise pounding)

PATRICIA

You have no choice, Jim. I see you

up there like Icarus. I see you flying

closer and closer to the sun. And

your wings are melting...

JIM

I want to live, Patricia. I don't

wanna die.

JIM

Patricia... Patricia...

COP

Whatcha doing there?

JIM

Uh... nuthin'

COP

(approaching,

suspicious)

Okay, outta there both of you. No

one's allowed backstage. Let's go.

PATRICIA

You idiot, don't you know who...

JIM

Hey, I'm with the band man. It's

cool. Take it easy.

COP

Let's go. NOW! You're both under

arrest.

JIM

(pointing to his

crotch, angry)

Hey, eat it man!

JIM

Mace! Shit!

(in pain)

PATRICIA

Help! They got Jim!!!

JIM

Why'd you blind me man? You blinded

me!

SIDDONS

What the hell happened!

(to Jim)

Don't touch Jim. Get some water.

Don't touch your eyes.

JIM

(in pain)

I BEEN BLINDED MAN. I BEEN MACED.

COP

(realizing)

Hey all he said was...

SIDDONS

He was WHAT! He's Jim Morrison for

chrissake. Jim, Jim -- you okay --

let's get you under the water here.

Don't touch, you'll be okay.

COP 1

I'm going to have to issue a warrant

for his arrest.

SIDDONS

Are you NUTS!

(blocking them)

RAY

Why don't you leave him alone lady,

he doesn't need more shit in his

life.

PATRICIA

What do you know what Jim needs?

JIM & DOORS

Make a grave for the unknown soldier

Nestled in your hollow shoulder

The unknown soldier

Practice as the news is read

Television children dead

Bullet strikes the helmet's head

It's all over

The war is over!

JIM & DOORS

OH YEEEEAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!

AYYYYYYAAAAAMMMMAAA BACK DOOR MAN.

JIM & DOORS

Well the men don't know

But the little girls unnerstan'...

JIM & DOORS

When all the good people are trying

to sleep

I'm out there making my midnight

creep

Yeah, cause I'm a backdoor man

The men don't know

But the little girls unnerstan'...

JIM

I wanna tell you 'bout something

that happened just a few minutes ago

right here in New Haven. This is New

Haven isn't it? New Haven,

Connecticut, United States of America?

HECKLER

HEY MORRISON, is the West really the

best or are you just stoned on

weeeeeedddddd??????

VOICE'S

(annoying)

"Light My Fire". Sing "Light My Fire".

Yeah. Give us Light My Fire!...

(giggles)

We want Mick Jagger! Take your clothes

off Jim. Show it to us! We want the

Lizard King!

JIM

(finally)

Well I was with this girl backstage,

y'know. We got to talking and we

wanted some privacy, so we went into

this shower stall. We weren't doin'

anything y'know jes' standing there

and talking.

JIM

...and then this little man came in

there, this little man in a little

blue suit and a little blue cap...

JIM

(redneck voice)

And he said -- "Whatcha doin' there?"

I said, "nuthin'" and he said, "Well

you better get outta there or..."

"Or what" I asked him...

JIM

And he started pushing me and I pushed

back and he didn't like that so he

reached back there and got out his

little can of mace. And sprayed it

right in my eyes. And blinded me.

Why? Cause I was alone in a room

with a lady doing what he would like

to be doing if he could ever get it

up without a gun.

JIM

In the United States of America.

Land of the free. Home of the Brave

man -- in God We Trust right? TURN

OFF THE LIGHTS.

JIM

Say your thing man!

LIEUTENANT

Young man you've gone too far. The

show's over. You're under arrest.

JOHN

(scared)

They're gonna beat the shit out of

him man!

JIM

(resisting)

HEY... HEY! HEY!

JIM

GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME SLAVE!

JIM

YOU'RE SLAVES. YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF

SLAVES. THIS ISN'T HAPPENING TO ME

MAN, THIS IS HAPPENING TO YOU!!!

COP 1

(coming in)

Hey whatcha got here? A boy or a

girl?

COP 2

(coming closer to Jim)

What do you care. You're gonna fuck

him anyway... Okay rock star, let's

about.

(stretching his ass

cheeks)

Where's the roach powder?

COP 1

Ain't he the prettiest long-haired

boy y'ever saw?

COP 2

(reaching for a can)

Turn around rock star.

COP 2

(backing off)

Stand clear, who the hell knows what's

living in there?

JIM

You finished? You sure you're

finished? Haven't you forgotten

something -- the consolation prize

they gave ya for taking your cock

and balls? The guns. Why don't you

use em you withered dicks! You shit-

eating red-neck chickenshit bastards,

I hope this makes your worthless

lives...

JIM

(on the floor, quiet)

You better kill me cause I'm gonna

come back and fuck everyone of your

daughters...

KIDS

LET JIM GO!!! MORRISON! MORRISON! WE

WANT MORRISON!

COPS

GET OUTTA HERE! GO HOME. GO ON NOW!

CROWD

MOR-RI-SON! MOR-RI-SON! MOR-RI-SON!

CROWD

JIM JIM JIM JIM JIM JIM...

RAY

(aside to Robbie)

He could go all the way man! In five

years he could be in the White House.

Another JFK.

CUT TO:

JIM

I drink so I can talk to assholes.

This includes me. Let's just say I

was testing the bounds of reality --

that's-all -- I was curious... I

kinda always preferred to be hated.

Like Erich Von Stroheim in the

movies... the man you loved to hate...

it's meant to be ironic, courage

wants to laugh. Y'know it's

essentially a stupid situation. I go

out on a stage and I howl for people.

In me they see what they want to see --

some say the Lizard King, whatever

that means, or some black-clad leather

demon whatever that means... but

really I think of myself as a

sensitive, intelligent human being

but with the soul of a clown which

always forces me to blow it at the

most crucial moment...

(pause)

a fake hero... a joke the gods played

on me... it's okay, I accept the

joke... and smile. Death old friend,

death and my cock, I can forgive my

injuries in the name of wisdom,

luxury, romance. Words got me the

wound and will get me well. All join

now in lament of my cock, a tongue

of knowledge in the feathered night.

Boys get crazy in the head and suffer.

I sacrifice my cock on the alter of

silence.

MIKE

Hey Jim, how 'bout hitting a strip-

joint? It's getting late and we can...

JIM

Nah, later...

JIM

Now listen to this I'll tell you

about Texas Radio and the big beat

soft driven slow and mad like some

new language reaching your head with

the cold sudden fury of a divine

messenger let me tell you about

heartache and the loss of God

wandering, wandering in hopeless

night out here on the perimeter there

are no stars out here we is stoned,

immaculate... but I tell you this:

No eternal reward will forgive us

now for wasting the dawn.

MIKE

Morning. Pour me breakfast Delores...

MIKE

Whatsa matter with Jimbo? Can't handle

it huh

(studying the beer

bottles for leftovers)

TOM

Pussy whipped, man...

DOG

Hey Jim, come on babe, eat this. . .

one last place to go. Ray's getting

it on.

JIM

(sparkling)

Alive she cried! Right Dog, another

cubic centimeter of chance

(slaps Dog, notices

the eggs, queasy)

Ugh, I can't eat this stuff, it'll

really make me sick. Gimme a Dos

Equis will ya Delores? And a Ramos

gin fizz with it.

TOM

Fuck man did you fade or what, we

were on a "death run" up to the 9000

building after the gig, you bet me a

grand you'd walk the ledge.

JIM

(instantly)

Let's go... Right now!

TOM

Then mumbling about "gotta go home,

sanctuary," pussy whipped. We were

gonna film it! A thousand bucks!

(to Delores)

Give him a double.

JIM

A triple, Tom, shem and shaun...

TOM

...imagine me and Morrison in a fuckin

movie together, can you imagine two

powerful two-fisted Irish fucking

drinking guys in a movie, in a

documentary movie!!

MIKE

I'll direct the shit out of it, man.

Dennis Hopper can do it, I can do

it.

JIM

(drinking the fizz

down)

...all of us direct it! In black and

white. Call it "Zero." A real road

movie! Two of these

(points to drink)

you feel a lot better.

DOG

Whatcha doing! Oh fuck.

DELORES

Fuck you Morrison. You're outta here

you fuckhead, get out!

DOG

(lifting Jim out of

there)

Come on Jimbo, one more place to go.

Ray's getting married man, this

morning, remember! You're the best

man.

TOM

Fuck Ray -- fuckin Pollock all he

cares about's money. Fuckin sell

out. You sold out too man. The last

album's shit, and lemme tell ya

something, people know it.

MIKE

(defending Jim)

Come on Baker, lighten up.

JIM

That's all right. I like it

(that dopey smile)

DOG

(to Jim)

Come on man, toe the line. Boots to

the pavement. Let's walk.

JIM

(to no one in

particular)

I LOVE L.A. -- the best neon. City

of Night! City of Light... why are

you going to work? You're not slaves,

you're free, cars, you're free...

TOM

Awright shaddup Morrison, just cause

you don't gotta work.

(going into his pocket)

Give me some of your money, asshole,

and I'll yell anything you fucking

want.

MIKE

(coming up)

What was that speckled motherfucker

you just took? Give me some!

JIM

(yielding, to Tom)

You gotta fail to succeed Tom, gotta

surrender to the waiting tides.

HIPPIE PRIEST

(ad lib)

Awright, the vibrations are right

now, I feel peace and love here today,

I feel a grooviness coming on, do

you Ray Manzarek take your lady

love... (etc.) fill the white wings

of death, scatter your ashes

forever...

RAY

(aside)

Where the fuck you been man?

JIM

Man, I been here all the time...

over there watching. I'm really happy

for you Ray you found life...

PAM

Jim, I need some safflower oil. Do

you think you can find me a bottle?

JIM

Safflower oil, sure.

PAM

And get some Gravy Train for Sage.

JIM

(obediently)

Yes.

PAM

I'll meet you up front.

TIMECUT TO:

PAM

Jim you got any cash?

PAM

It's only another $95,000 but I could

get the best clothes. From India,

Morocco Jim, clothes you can't find

anywhere, we could get the richest

people to come, Miles Davis, Cher,

the Stones, it's gonna be the best

boutique on La Cienega Jim... why

are we walking, how come we don't

have a car?

JIM

...cause you lost it. It's fun to

walk, isn't it.

PAM

...that was months ago. We got another

car.

JIM

Which car?

PAM

The red one with the black interior.

Remember it was a shift and I didn't

like it. What happened to it?

JIM

Oh yeah... I wrecked it.

PAM

Oh Jim! Damn! Where's the Gravy Train?

Whatsamatter? What are you on? You

promised you wouldn't drink today.

JIM

No Ma I ain't drinking.

PAM

You're not gonna drink any more are

you Jim.

JIM

No Ma I ain't.

PAM

And you're gonna change those stinky

leathers you been wearing for three

weeks.

JIM

I don't know 'bout that.

PAM

What the hell are you on?

JIM

Uh -- just some low grade acid. It's

not heavy.

(whispers)

Pam, read my mind.

PAM

Jesus Jim! Goddamit! You PROMISED. I

made the duck! People are coming!

Ray and Dorothy think we're flaky

enough and I... you said you'd wait

till after, you're going to peak

before me.

JIM

Hey it's okay, it's okay... come on,

we'll trip and then eat our feast.

PAM

Yeah sure.

JIM

Come on baby, y'know it's a good

thing for Ray and Dorothy I think

women are such noble creatures --

they carry on your name with dignity

after you die.

(spawning like minnows)

PAM

What are you saying? You wanna marry

me Jim?

JIM

(elusively)

I think women basically have a comic

approach to life -- I mean how can

they not when they look up in the

dark and see a dangling penis, seeking

entry. It looks like a face y'know --

little beard "Hi mom"

(Pam giggling now)

I wanna get inside you. Look around.

(humming)

"Do the funky chicken, do dah, dah,

funky chicken do da da "love my girl" --

JIM

Let's go wild child, let's get out

there Romeo and Juliet, Marilyn Monroe

and Vincent Van Gogh, Jim and Pam,

rock and roll

(a poem)

...all the poetry has wolves in it,

but one Pam -- the most beautiful

one of all -- dances in a ring of

fire and throws off the challenge

with a shrug

PAM

(romantic)

I like it when you sing to me

JIM

'cause I'm the poet and you're my

muse

PAM

What am I going to do about these

papers! Jim, Jim -- you really need

someone to organize this stuff. Your

handwriting's just like a little

kid.

PAM

My God look at this. I wonder if

William Blake was ever this

disorganized.

DOROTHY

Oh the duck!

JIM

(coming over)

Get some drinks, man. Over there

(getting Pam's

attention)

Pam!

PAM

I'm gonna be your editor now,

seriously I'm going to organize all

your stuff. I'm gonna take out all

the fuck words.

JIM

Let's go wild child, let's get out

there Romeo and Juliet, Marilyn Monroe

and Vincent Van Gogh, Jim and Pam,

rock and roll

(a poem)

"Clothed in sunlight Restless in

wanting Dying of fever Changed shapes

of an empire Vast promissory notes

of joy How it has changed you How

slowly estranged you Solely arranged

you Beg you for mercy"

JIM

(cupping her chin)

Pam... Honey, you're trying too hard.

PAM

I'm not -- I'm not.

JIM

(soft, reassuring)

Yes you are.

PAM

There's some great poetry here Jim,

some wonderful ideas.

JIM

Yeah but nobody wants to read poetry

anymore, nobody cares, it's not like

important y'know. Just put it away.

Not right now.

PAM

(lost)

But what am I supposed to do? How do

I fit in? Who am I supposed to be

around all these people?

COUNT

Darling Pamela, I brought you a little

something.

JIM

(ignoring it)

You're my girl, that's who...

PAMELA

(laughs insanely)

I'm not your girl, don't give me

that shit. I know you fuck everything

that touches you.

ANNE

Hi Jim...

(waiting for the

introduction to Pam)

JIM

(to Pamela)

All right so I do. I live my life

the way I want. I don't want anyone

expecting anything from me --

including you! You don't like it

then get the fuck out!

(to Anne)

Oh hi Anne. You know Pam? She's a

little pissed off right now but...

RAY

Okay Jim let's eat that duck.

DOROTHY

(calming Pamela)

Come on Pam, let's put out the

thru to Anne)

Anne O'Riordan. Are you Anne

O'Riordan?

ANNE

You must be Pamela

PAMELA

(eyeing her up and

down through her

tears)

You actually put your dick in this

woman Jim?

JIM

Well I... sometimes yeah

PAMELA

(condescending to

Anne)

I understand... I really do but don't

ever think that Jim's gonna love you

or take care of you. You're one of a

hundred you know

JIM

Hey -- don't you know when to stop!

PAM

Look who's talking

ANNE

I'd like to think Jim can make up

his own mind who he loves and who he

doesn't.

PAMELA

Don't kid yourself sweetheart, Jim's

crazy but he's not that crazy. He

loves me.

ROBBIE

Jesus, it's not gonna be one of these

dinners is it Jim? How 'bout some

BAKER

DOROTHY

HARD CUT TO:

JIM & DOORS

There's been a slaughter here

Don't stop to speak or look around

Your gloves and fan are on the ground

We're getting out of town we're going

on the run

And you're the one I want to come

Not to touch the earth

Not to see the sun

Nothing left to do

But run, run, run

Let's run, let's run...

SIDDONS

Vice Squad says one more "fuck or

MIKE

Stick my dick in their ear!

JIM & DOORS

House upon the hill

Moon is lying still...

JIM & DOORS

Shadows of the trees witnessing the

PAM

(stoned)

Hi.

COUNT

Scusi Jimmy, I hope you're cool about

this...

JIM

(very cool)

Don't forget your smack on the way

out.

JIM

(yelling)

The mansion is warm at the top of

the hill

Rich are the rooms and the comforts

there

Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs

You won't know a thing till you get

inside

BACK TO:

JIM

I told you about that shit. Or are

we talking about death choices here?

PAM

I'm just doing my thing, just like

you said, it's my thing, why can't I

have a thing. Ow! You're hurting me!

JIM

(rising anger)

Get up. Hurt? You want to know HURT?

Let me introduce you to my good friend

hurt.

PAM

(screaming)

NO FUCK YOU! THIS IS MY...

JIM

(crazed)

Ah sanctuary!... a soft place to

JIM

I'll give you a place to hide forever!

PAM

JIM

This is the best part of the trip,

JIM & THE DOORS

Dead President's corpse in the

driver's car

The engine runs on glue and tar

C'mon along, we're not going very

far

To the East to meet the Czar...

HIGH PRIESTESS

(dimly heard)

...we worship the ancient forces of

Nature, the Triple Goddess, the Great

Mother and the Lord, the Horned One...

when the vow is taken

HIGH PRIESTESS

...it is a blending of souls on a

karmi and cosmic plane that affects

your future incarnations on this

planet. Death does not part -- only

lack of love -- and the vow is forever

in the Goddess' sight.

JIM & DOORS

(building faster and

faster)

Run with me, run with me

Run with me, let's run

Some outlaws live by the side of a

lake

The minister's daughter's in love

with a snake

JIM & DOORS

Who lives in a well by the side of

the road

Wake up girl! We're almost home

We shall see the gates by morning

We shall be inside by evening

Sun, sun, sun

Burn, burn, burn

Moon, moon, moon!

JIM & DOORS

JIM

(indifferent, to

himself)

I am the Lizard King I can do anything

JUDY

Man wow -- watsa matter Jim? It was

beautiful... wasn't it? Kim? Wasn't

it great?

KIM

(2nd girl, studying

murder magazine)

It was all right

JIM

(gently)

Hey it's no big deal. I like to cry

when I come. It's close to death...

maybe you'd better go home now before

your mama gets home.

JUDY

She is home Jim

(whispers to Kim who

goes into bathroom,

giggling)

JIM

What?

JUDY

It's a secret.

JIM

(innocently)

You know you've always been good to

me in bed Judy. And it was nice of

you to bring your friend. I want to

keep seeing both of you but it can't

be all the time y'know. It would be

a night every few weeks or so. That's

just the way I am, I'm not dependable.

I can't be a boyfriend. Would you do

that? I mean could you handle it?

That way? I don't want you to get

hurt.

JUDY

(putting on a tacky

dress)

I already been hurt enuf' by you

Jim, I don't have much to lose do I?

JIM

...do you love me?

JUDY

...yes

JIM

...Well, just think about it awhile.

Call me when you get your new

number...

(Girl 2 comes back

in, dressed)

Hey that's a really nice outfit you're

wearing, you really have good taste

in clothes. How long have you two

been friends?

JIM

(grins)

What?

JIM

Come back later!

(another knock)

Who is it!

VOICE

(slurred)

It's a secret.

JIM

(recognizes it)

Whyn't you come back later. I don't

have any clothes on.

PAM

Jim, I gotta talk! Let me in please.

I gotta talk.

JIM

Now Pam sweetheart, I'm busy.

PAM

Jim, I know there's someone in there,

I can't believe you're doing this

again. You're disgusting.

INTERCUTS TO:

JIM

Well you see Pam there's this crazy

girl in here, she's just lying on

the bed with her legs open and I

don't know what to do.

PAM

FUCK YOU!!! I want to see her.

JIM

(off)

It's your cousin Lizzie, you don't

want to see her. Go home.

PAM

We're all sisters, let me see her.

Jim,... I got this wonderful leg of

lamb in the oven for supper... and

the house is immaculate. Sage is

waiting. He wants you to play with

him... are you coming...

JIM

Almost.

PAM

Jim goddamit answer me!!

(no answer, she yells)

JIM! I FUCKED HIM TO HURT YOU! HE

DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME!!

JIM

What was that promise you made

Why don't you tell me what she said

What was that promise that she made

I'm gonna love you

Till the heaven stops the rain

I'm gonna love you

Till the stars fall from the sky

For you and I...

PAUL

(to Botnick the

engineer)

...fuckin' neanderthal primadonna is

too drunk to see.

(cuts the music, to

Jim)

Cut it... that was beautiful

sweetheat, we had a technical problem,

we'll take it again from the top

babe whenever you're ready.

DENSMORE

What's his fucking problem?

JIM

(equally false)

Paul babe.

PAUL

Right here baby.

JIM

Why don't you suck a fart out of my

asshole you slave driving facist

motherfucker!

PAUL

(exasperated)

I hear the booze, I hear the smokes

Jim, I don't hear the voice and babe

I didn't hear the song!

JIM

So what are we going to tonight Paul!

67 takes! It's stale!

RAY

(coming in with JOHN)

Alright, let's try something else.

JIM

I wanna sing blues. This stuffs

getting too self-conscious.

ROBBIE

(offended)

Cause it's my song man?

JIM

(simultaneous,

incomprehensible)

Let's sing "Rock is Dead"! You're

all a buncha slaves... "Oh come all

ye faithful."

PAUL

(hot)

Shut up Jim! I don't understand! I

don't. What are ya doing! I love you

like a brother, I do, but why are

you fucking this up. It's a perfect

radio song for chrissake! No one

wants to hear the blues anymore!

Think like a singer, you're the only

baritone crooner we got left...

Sinatra, Elvis, Crosby, you're as

good as they are, but WHY ARE YOU

FUCKING THIS UP! WHY!

JIM

Catchy, you sold it to a commercial?

JIM

For that? How much did you get for

it?

RAY

Now, Jim...

JIM

HOW MUCH?

SIDDONS

It was $50,000. You weren't talking

to us that week and we figgered you...

JIM

You figured? What the fuck is this

Ray?

RAY

It's not like a big deal Jim, the

song's already been commercialized,

the money was great. Robbie wrote

the lyrics and he didn't mind, neither

did I, neither did John... we gotta

get to TV.

JIM

What?... are you saying? Are we the

Doors? One for all and all for one?

Do you know what you're saying to

those millions of kids! "Just kidding,

not real". That's what you're saying.

JOHN

Oh come on man, you think just cause

you're the lead man in the band you

can run the whole show.

JIM

(building intensity)

You think I was kidding Ray?

(turning to John)

Hey John, those are interesting shoes,

you like those shoes?

JOHN

(aggressive)

Yeah I do.

JIM

Good. Then do you want 50 of those

shoes?

JOHN

No.

JIM

Then what do you need more money

for?

JIM

I'm dying Ray. I wasn't kidding.

Maybe you were. But I'll tell you

something, it's not about these

desires you have man, or money, or

these records, it's about breaking

through wasn't it? You just lost

something man.

(to all)

We all lost something boys. We lost

something.

RAY

I don't think so Jim. There's a bigger

picture here.

JIM

There sure is. In your fucking face!

JIM

(quietly)

Just kidding...

(turning to Pam)

Hi Pam. Just watchin' some TV.

PAM

(pathetic)

I wanted you to find us Jim. It meant

nothing.

JIM

I know. I know.

PAM

You don't have to torture me Jim.

Let me make it up to you, please...

JIM

It's alright honey, it's gonna be

alright. You're my girl and that's

the way it's always gonna stay.

PAM

(snuggles him, zoned)

Really...?

JIM

(ironic, to the others)

So, let's keep that money machine

rolling. Come on guys...

PAUL

Right on Jimbo.

TIME CUT TO:

JIM

(reciting)

When I was back there in seminary

school

There was a person there

Who put forth the proposition

That you can petition the Lord with

prayer

Petition the Lord with prayer

Petition the Lord with prayer

PETITION THE LORD WITH PRAYER

PAUL

Where the hell did she go?

JIM & DOORS

Can you give me sanctuary

I must find a place to hide

A place for me to hide...

PAM

(sotto voice)

...sing to me, Jim, sing to me.

JIM & DOORS

Can you find me soft asylum

I can't make it any more

The man is at the door

JIM & DOORS

Catacombs, nursury bones

Winter women

Streets and shoes, avenues

Leather riders selling shoes

(The monk bought lunch)

Successful hills are here to stay

Everything must be this way

Gentle street where people play

Welcome to the soft parade

JIM & DOORS

All our lives we sweat and save

Building for a shallow grave

(then)

The soft parade has now begun

Listen to the engines hum

People out to have some fun

A cobra on my left

Leopard on my right

JIM SONG

(fiercely)

Calling on the dogs (5)

When all else fails

You can whip the horses' eyes

And make them sleep

And cry.

PAM

I love you.

JIM

(reciting)

Why does my mind circle around you?

Why do planets wonder what it would

be like to be you?

All your soft wild promises were

words, birds,

Endlessly in flight

Being drunk is the best disguise

As the body is ravaged

The spirit grows stronger

ENGINEER

Let's send out for some pizza Jim.

JIM

Nah, how 'bout some tacos when we're

through?

(downs another shot,

continues)

The world on fire

Taxi from Africa

The grand hotel he was drunk a big

party last night back, going back in

all directions sleeping these insane

hours I'll never wake up in a good

mood again

I'm sick of these stinky boots

Do you know we are being led to

slaughters by placid admirals?

And that fat slow generals are getting

obscene on young blood?

Do you know we are ruled by TV?

(pause)

SLOW DISSOLVE BEGINS:

JIM

Oh great Creator of Being

Grant us one more hour to perform

our art and perfect our lives

The moths and atheists are doubly

divine in dying

We live, we die, and death not ends

it

Journey we more into the nightmare

We're reaching for death on the end

of a candle

We're trying for something that's

already found us...

DISSOLVING TO:

RADIO DJ/CRITIC

(into microphone)

A hot night in Miami January '69 --

every space in the auditorium is

consumed... unfortunately the Doors

have long since sold out. They've

become an act. Morrison "falls" off

the stage at least every other

performance. "The Soft Parade" album

only confirms the plasticity of their

approach. Songs like "Touch Me" and

"Follow Me Down" are not the Doors

we once knew. So the question is:

Why am I here? Are funerals

entertainment?

DENSMORE

He ain't gonna show! I know it man.

We should fuckin' go on without him.

RAY

Bill's with him. They're an hour

away, he'll get him here.

SIDDONS

Goddamit Jim! We missed one already,

we gotta get this one man!

JIM

More!

MIKE

Four more all around and up and down!

SIDDONS

(urgent)

NO! CUT EM OFF! CUT EM OFF!

JIM

Don't be so melodramatic Bill, it's

not fun anymore.

DOG

I can't fly sober.

SIDDONS

Jim, you don't show for this one,

we're dead, the whole group -- no

more bookings.

JIM

I care.

PAUL

Come on Jim, we'll get fuckin' laid

in Miami.

SIDDONS

We need the work Jim! They're making

us post a $10,000 bond just to show

up -- we're the only group in rock-n-

roll with a fuck clause!

(aside to Dog)

Get him on the fuckin' plane. That's

what I pay you for.

DOG

(to Bill)

You're an awful little guy to be

talking like that.

JIM

(muttering)

Chump change, we're working for chump

change.

SIDDONS

Look at you, you're a pathetic fuckin'

slob and so are all your friends!

JIM

I got an idea Bill, you're fired.

INTERCUT TO:

JOHN

Listen to 'em! They're not coming

for the music anymore. They're coming

to see a fuckin' freak show!

RAY

You think it's easy for him. He moves

left he's got vice squad, on the

right narcs -- and the audience just

waiting for him to get busted.

JOHN

He wanted it! Not us. I just don't

fuckin' get the point anymore. I

never did I guess. Y'ask me he's

just become a drunken fuckin' asshole

that's what. And he's gonna take us

down with him.

RAY

Compassion was never your forte man.

JOHN

Don't lecture me Mr. Philosopher,

you never felt a fuckin thing in

your life. I loved that man. I loved

what he was.

ROBBIE

It ain't the old Jim that's for sure.

I think he's living for everybody

else man and somewhere along the way

he's lost his own self.

RAY

(almost to himself)

The wine man, the ancient wine. The

ancient wine.

ROBBIE

What?

RAY

Something he once told us. About

Dionysos. When the madness took

over...

INTERCUT TO:

STEWARDESS

My name is Rita Hager and if...

JIM

If your name is Rita, then yor ol

man must be ol man Rita!!

(guffaws)

TOM, MIKE & DOG

(chorusing)

That ol man Riva, he just keep rolling

along!

STEWARDESS

Excuse me sir, my father is not my

old man.

TIMECUT TO:

STEWARDESS

In the event of a decrease of

pressure, pull the oxygen mask to

your...

TOM

Ma ol lady had one of those but she

calls it a diaphragm when I'm eating

her out!

DOG

Nah, it's a douche bag on a dixie

cup.

STEWARDESS

I'm sorry sir, but you're embarrassing

me.

MIKE

Great tits.

SIDDONS

Come on guys, cool it!

TIME CUT TO:

JIM

(teasing to Rothchild

in the row behind

him)

C'mon Paul, you can get us some heroin

man.

PAUL

(suddenly serious)

No I can't and I won't.

JIM

Why not?

PAUL

Cause I don't want to participate in

anything that would accomplish your

goal?

JIM

(wry)

Oh and what is my goal Paul? Death?

PAUL

"Death old friend".

JIM

(laughing)

Wrong. I just want the pure beauty

of absolute zero and sing the blues

man -- do nuthin, go nowhere, just

be.

TOM

With that waistline Jimbo you got no

choice.

JIM

(laughs, goodnatured)

What's wrong with being a large

mammal, a big beast like a tank. I

feel great!

DOG

Yeah. What's wrong with being fat.

TOM

You mean "Crawling King Flab"? Rock

is cock babe and your rock is dyin'.

JIM

Rock is death! There is no longer

belief. Hey, I'll write poetry and

direct movies.

TOM

And what are you offering? Sex? You

can't get it up. Salvation? You can't

even save yourself. Come on Jim,

you're not gonna be remembered.

JIM

Miss?...

STEWARDESS

What do you need?

JIM

Some love.

MIKE

They'll still be talking about Jim

when you're a walk on Baker. I'll

make you a deal. When you do

something, I'll criticize it.

TOM

I think you both should take your

heads out of the toilet bowl. After

"Soft Parade" You need an album

sweetheart.

MIKE

You should take it outta your ass.

JIM

The first two novels come along they

love you, next few they slam but if

you stay around long enough, one day

they say, "hey he's part of the

national psyche".

STEWARDESS

What are you drinking?

MIKE

Screwdrives-her.

(lifts her skirt)

STEWARDESS

(to Siddons)

I'm going to have to call the captain

if you can't control these people. I

guarantee that.

TOM

(a cruel sarcasm Jim

seems to enjoy)

...if you live long enough, don't

kid yourself Jimbo -- you're all

alone out there, Jimbo, cept for me,

cause you're too wacked out man,

they're scared, you're too fuckin

crazy.

JIM

(feigning innocence)

I wasn't mad, Tom. I was only

interested in freedom.

TOM

(the devil)

Bullshit! You're bored, you're not

free. You tested all the limits,

fame, fucking, money, -- whatcha

gonna do now Jimbo! When the music's

over, when you're too fat and ugly

to get on a stage, whatcha gonna do

for act three -- puke on Heaven's

door?

JIM

Listen you two bit fuckin actor, you

underestimate the audience. You think

they all want a better job, a house,

two cars, money, that's what you

think but you know what they really

want, Tom, in their lives, what they

really want --

TOM

Tell me.

JIM

(a whisper)

...something sacred, that's what

they want, something sacred.

JIM

Fuck you ignorant devil's asshole

slave!

TOM

No you. Something sacred. My cock is

sacred. Suck on that!

JIM

I don't eat shrimp.

DOG

Incoming!

CAPTAIN

ALL RIGHT!! If you young men don't

change your attitude right now, when

we get to Miami you're going to be

arrested.

JIM

Yes, sir.

(reflexively)

TOM

(saluting)

YESSIR -- you asshole.

CAPTAIN

As captain of this ship I'm placing

all four of you under arrest. The

FBI will...

MIKE

DISSOLVING TO:

JUDGE VOICE

...you are charged under four counts

with lewd behavior, simulated

masturbation, public drunkenness,

profanity, and public exposure.

JIM (V.O.)

I can't believe this is happening

I can't believe all these people are

sniffing each other & backing away,

teeth grinning, hair raised, growling,

here in the slaughtered wind

This is it

No more fun the death of all joy has

come

LAWYER

Your Honor, I would like to bring to

the Court's attention the contemporary

Broadway musical "Hair" in which

cast members disrobe and appear naked

on the stage.

JUDGE

(pounds his gavel)

Inadmissable evidence.

JIM VOICE OVER

I had a vision of America

Seen from the air 28,000 ft. & going

fast

A one-armed man in a Texas parking

labyrinth

A burnt tree like a giant primeval

bird in an empty lot in Fresno

Your Honor... any difference from

the Miami nightclubs where comedians

frequently incorporate profanity

into their acts

JUDGE

(gavel)

Inadmissable evidence.

JIM VOICE OVER

Miles & miles of hotel corridors &

SUPERIMPOSITION:

LAWYER

(distant)

...there has not been one shred of

evidence: 300 photographs and not

one shows a thing; not reliable

testimony, nothing but hysterical

heresay

SUPERIMPOSITION TO:

LAWYER

...this is a major First Amendment

violation by the Police and

Politicians of Miami. Every witness

they've brought has admitted under

oath to not actually seeing the

client's genitals -- except one who...

JIM

...Well, you gonna get rid of it?

Fucked up people y'know, crazies,

unwanted Indians just throw it in

the river.

PATRICIA

I can't fucking believe you just

said that!

JIM

Patricia, wouldn't it be better to

have a kid with someone who wanted

to be its father?

PATRICIA

It'd be a fucking genius, that's

what it'd be! You and me. The child

would be a god, goddess!

JIM

It'd be a monster.

JIM

I got this trial dragging on me,

Patricia. I couldn't support the kid --

I can't afford it and I don't want

the responsibility right now.

PATRICIA

You're a COWARD!! A LITTLE BOY!! The

only way you can't afford it is

emotionally. You forgot your vows

man. They were forever in the goddess'

sight. Death doesn't part, only love

Jim!

JIM

Come on Patricia, I was stoned... it

seemed like the fun thing at the

time.

PATRICIA

I'm gonna cut your balls off Morrison!

JIM

(that smile)

You want 'em?

PATRICIA

(beat)

FUCK YOU. I'm gonna have the kid.

JIM

Then it'll be your kid. If you want

the abortion I'll pay for it and

I'll come up to New York to be with

you when you have it.

PATRICIA

No you won't.

JIM

Yes I will.

PATRICIA

Bullshit Morrison

(release him, stalks)

You know who you are...

(pause)

NO. What difference does it make.

You know, you never pretended. I

did. I don't even like kids

particularly,

(laughs to herself)

but I don't want the other thing

either. I guess what I really want

is to throw myself off this fucking

balcony

(Hurls the knife out

off the balcony)

Well now that you've fucked the

future, Morrison, have you fucked

everything?...

(cruelly)

Have you looked at yourself in the

mirror. Your stomach...

JIM

(hurt, near tears)

Please don't say those things to me,

Patricia.

PATRICIA

Fuck me one last time, you worthless

piece of shit.

SPEAKER

(bullhorn)

...endorsed by President Richard

Nixon!

(cheers)

The immoral conduct of degenerates

such as Jim Morrison is an

unacceptable insult to this country

and the principles for which it

stands...

JIM

Well uh, it's designed to wear you

down y'know... when that rap sheet

says the "United States of America

versus You" it takes you down day by

day, specially when no one really

gives a shit about, y'know, the First

Amendment that's on trial here...

Nobody says anything about that,

it's just uh did you take your pants

off y'know, I mean that's not what

it's about, it's about freedom, that's

what it's about... but who cares,

right? Freedom exists in a schoolbook.

REPORTER 1

(disinterested)

...but the promoters are cancelling

your shows, will this affect the way

you play?

JIM

Well, I can only open doors, M'am. I

can't drag people thru 'em. I'm no

savior.

REPORTER 2

But you've called yourself a shaman?

JIM

(beat, pained)

Did I? Well, I'll tell ya, my words

stand a far better chance of being

around a hundred years from now than

my waistline.

ANCHORLADY

The question that will be answered

today: Did Jim Morrison or did he

not take off his pants last March?

This is...

magazine)

Jesus Jim, this guy really despises

you.

JOHN

...didn't invite us to Woodstock.

Twenty other groups but not...

SIDDONS

What's heavy is the radio stations

pulling us from their playlists. The

big cities -- Philly, Cinci, Chicago,

Detroit -- it's insane! Record sales

suck!

RAY

(with irony, reading

something)

"The band you love to hate".

LAWYER

(2nd Lawyer if

necessary)

We can drag this appeal out for years,

we can keep you out of jail.

JIM

(drinking)

You're drinking with number three.

SIDDONS

Max firmly believes the FBI's behind

it. We're subpoenaing their records --

they had memos on you in Phoenix and

they got you extradicted to Miami

illegally without a felony...

MIKE

A new image -- Jim Morrison as

"Renaissance Man" -- We bring you

back slow, quiet, the beard, elder

of the tribe.

with the music or it grows without

you."

PAM

JIM

RAY

Pam!! Oh shit... get the ambulances

RAY

(yelling down)

JIM! HELP HER. She's gonna fall.

TOM

Jump!

JIM

Come on baby, come on.

RAY

(trying another tack)

Jim we gotta finish "LA Woman".

JIM

Don't have an ending Ray.

RAY

(white)

They're both gonna die... ARE YOU

HAPPY YOU COCKSUCKERS!!

JIM

Come on baby, come on

PAM

(quoting him)

"...but one, the most beautiful one

of all -- dances in a ring of fire --

"

JIM

(raw singing)

"I see your hair is burning. If they

say I never loved you, you know they

are a liar!"

PAM

"...and throws off the challenge

with a shrug"

JIM

All the poetry has wolves in it Pam!!!

PAM

I don't wanna die with you Jim

Morrison, I don't wanna die!

JIM

C'mon Pam, this is it! We'll do it

right here! Right now! You and me!

PAM

Jim -- let's go, let's leave this

town! You and me! Never come back.

JIM

(demonic)

We can. Right now. Just one more

step...

PAM

No Jim. I want to LIVE with you. I

want to LIVE with you.

JIM

(a poem)

There was preserved in her the fresh

miracle of surprise... clothed in

sunlight restless in wanting dying

of fever married to doubt how it has

changed you how slowly estranged you

solely arranged you beg for your

mercy -- OR -- ...but all will pass

lie down in green grass and smile

and muse and gaze upon her smooth

resemblance to the mating-Queen who

it seems is in love with the horseman

Tomorrow we enter the tomb of my

birth I want to be ready.

DISSOLVE TO:

JIM & DOORS

With a little girl in a Hollywood

bungalow

Are you a lucky lady in the City of

Light?

Or just another lost angel -- City

of Night?

JIM & DOORS

LA Woman (X2)

LA Woman / Sunday Afternoon (X3)

Drive thru your suburbs

Into your blues (X2)

Into your blue-blue blues

JIM

Eek Dorothy! You cut your hair!

DOROTHY

We're trying to have another baby.

JIM

(moving past her)

What -- was your hair getting in the

way?

(she smacks him lightly)

Where are the kids?

JIM

Hey -- am I late or is this the cool

remnant of a dream?

KIDS

(rushing to him)

Eee! Jim! It's Uncle Jim... Come

on... what did you bring me Jim...

JIM

(picks up Robin)

How's my girl! And how's my boy!

JIM

(ad libs)

For you... Pancho gets this one...

Melanie -- yours... Hey Dorothy don't

grab now... open that one, that's

yours... keep your paws off that

now...

JIM

(to Robin, a 5 year

old)

...and to you, princess, from your

Royal servant, James Douglas Morrison

(bows)

RAY

You wanna hear the new mixes on "LA

WOMAN?"...

JIM

No, I gotta plane to catch.

JOHN

Won't take long man, it's the best

one since "Days".

ROBBIE

We added rain to "Riders", come on.

KID

Ugh! What's that!

ROBIN

(to Jim)

It's you.

JIM

Forever young...

ROBIN

Oh it's beautiful... Thank you Uncle

Jim.

JIM

I gotta admit -- that ain't bad for

four guys who weren't even talking

that day.

JOHN

You really gonna live in Paris man?

JIM

Yeah John, be anonymous, write a

book: "Observations of an American

While on Trial in Miami".

ROBBIE

I still think we got a couple of

great blues albums in us man.

JIM

I'm pinned man. Everything I do they

got a category for it, y'know.

Freedom's gone.

JOHN

Hey, I'm gonna miss you Jim. I'm

gonna miss the feeling of playing

music with you.

JIM

You can always whip the horses' eyes.

You, John, miss me?

JOHN

More than you think asshole.

(turn away, repressing --

the emotions)

ROBBIE

(walking him to the

garden)

Well far as I'm concerned, Jim, I

made music with Dionysus man. We had

some moments on stage like no one

will ever fucking know.

JIM

(making light)

Yeah, yeah -- and you lay off those

drugs Rob. We're gonna play again

some day.

ROBBIE

Jim -- "do not go gently into that

good night. Rage rage against the

dying of the light".

(he winks goodbye)

GIRLS

Come 'ere Uncle Jim, we're playing

blind man's bluff...

TIME CUT TO:

JIM

(to Robin)

So what are you gonna be when you

grow up?

ROBIN

I wanna be your wife

JIM

I don't know, can I afford you? Pam

kinda wiped me out with her dress

store y'know...

ROBIN

I'll make my own dresses and you'll

see, I'll be the best wife.

DOROTHY

(nodding)

You'll never be alone Jim.

JIM

(to Dorothy)

You know I've never been happier.

Not as much of a rush as I used to

be in y'know... this is the strangest

life I've ever known.

TIME CUT TO:

RAY

Gotta plane to catch man?

JIM

O?... splittling headache from which

the future is made.

RAY

Is Pam really there in Paris waiting?

JIM

(ironic, head hurts)

Sure. The Count's there so where

else would she be? Gotta try to start

over, without all the hassles, y'know.

I think we can.

RAY

I never knew what you saw in that

nightmare chick man.

JIM

Well she is kinda flakey -- like me.

I mean she's just so vulnerable about

everything. It makes me sad man.

(pause)

But she's always kinda believed in

something about me y'know -- her

little picture of me as the unsung

poet -- and it's a fantasy I kinda

dig y'know, 'stead of the one I live.

RAY

I don't know man, I don't wanna sound

like your old man but you're only

27, you're living like you gotta get

it all in, you gotta slow down man,

you did it, you broke thru to the

other side.

JIM

We didn't break thru Ray, we just

pushed things a little. When you

really break thru, there's nothing

left. No music, no Doors, no God,

nothing -- only a will to power.

RAY

I don't believe that. You were an

American prince, man -- with overbred

genes --

(Jim scoffs, laughs)

No! What could've been Jim? You

could've been President.

(Jim cracks up)

No man! What could've been Jim? We

stood here on this beach on the edge

of the Pacific that crazy summer day

in '65 -- and we knew, you and I, we

knew we were at the edge of the mind.

we were there, man. One planet, one

globe, one mind. Consciousness, we

raised it, we were there.

JIM

And now what?

RAY

Now?

(smiles, lethally

sweet)

You've made me into Ishmael. I am

the last survivor of the Pequod. And

I exist only to tell the story of

Ahab who fought the black whale.

JIM

(loves it, laughs)

It was white Ray. You gotta stop

harpin' on that day. I was so ripped

I can hardly remember it.

RAY

Hey, what was that poem you once

wrote about two chicks on the pier?

JIM

Come on man, I gotta fly.

RAY

Come on. Just once.

JIM

(VOICE OVER, pulling

out the car)

In that year we had a great

Visitation of energy

Back in those days

Everything was simpler and more

confused

One summer night, going to the pier

I ran into two young girls

The blonde was called Freedom

The dark one Enterprise

We talked

And they told me this story.

RAY

(OVER)

What was the story?

MORRISON

Well, didja get all that?

GHOSTMAN

You done good, Jim, go now -- rest

ENGINEER

Yeah, I got it Jim.

JIM

Aw right. Let's get some tacos!

PAM

Jim... that you?

PAM

Jim! It was you. I always know when

it's you.

(moving closer)

Come on baby get out of the tub...

mama'll dry you off...

(pause)

Jim Morrison, now you stop joking

you hear me, cut it out!

PAM

...was it all right Jim, did you

enjoy it when it came my baby? Just

like you said it'd be?

JIM

(OVER)

They are waiting to take us into the

severed garden do you know how pale

and wanton thrillful comes death at

a strange hour? Unannounced unplanned

for like a scaring overfriendly guest

you've brought to bed? Death makes

angels of us all? And gives us wings

where we had shoulders smooth as

raven's claws...

DISSOLVE TO:

JIM

(OVER)

No more money, no more fancy dress

this other kingdom seems by far the

best until its other jaw reveals

incest and loose obedience to a

vegetable law. I will not go I prefer

a feast of friends to the giant

family...

GHOST ANNOUNCER

Ladies and Gentlemen, from Los Angeles

California -- The Doors!

(ghostly applause)

JIM & THE DOORS

(snatches)

...have you seen the warm progress

under the stars?

Have you forgotten the keys to the

kingdom?

Have you been born yet and are you

alive?

Where is the feast we were promised?

Let's reinvent the gods, the myths

of the ages!

We need great golden copulations

JIM

Well, I'll tell you a story of

whiskey, mystics and men

And about the believers and how the

whole thing began

First there were women and children

obeying the moon

Then daylight brought wisdom and

sickness too soon... the moon is a

dry blood beast

We have assembled inside this ancient

and insane theatre to propagate our

lust for life and flee the swarming

wisdom of the streets we live we die

and death not ends it

(screams in agony)

FATHER HAVE MERCY!!!

JIM

Bird of prey, bird of prey

Flying high, flying high in the summer

sky

Bird of prey, bird of prey flying

high, flying high gently pass by

Bird of prey, bird of prey flying

high, flying high

Take me on your flight

(pause then)

I will come again down from the wild

mountains
