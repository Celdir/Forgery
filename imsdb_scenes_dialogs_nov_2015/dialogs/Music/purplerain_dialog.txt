(1) Black Screen

PRINCE

(over)

Dearly belov`ed,

We are gathered here today

To get through this thing

called life.

Electric word life,

It means forever and that's a

mighty long time.

But I'm here to tell you that

there's something else -- The

afterworld.

PRINCE

(con't)

That's right...a world of

never-ending happiness,

You can always see the sun --

Day or night.

PRINCE

(con't)

So when you call up that

shrink in Beverly Hills,

You know the one -- Doctor

Everything'll Be Alright--

Instead of asking him how much

of your mind is left,

Ask him how much of your time,

`Cause in this life,

Things are much harder than in

the afterworld,

In this life, You're on your

own.

PRINCE

(con't)

And if de-elevator tries to

bring you down,

Go crazy, punch a higher

floor.

(suspicious)

Why didn't they give it to me

themselves?

(24) INT.  REHEARSAL HALL -- DAY

MORRIS

One, two, three, kick!  One,

two, three, kick! Four,

MORRIS

You ladies don't seem to

realize how valuable my time

is.  You're going to make my

boys look bad.

BRENDA

Why don't you let us come up

with our own steps?

MORRIS

We tried that...

(sweetly)

... remember?

MORRIS

Now you're in the best

possible position you can be

in, so what' s the matter --

your shoes on too tight or

something?

(claps his hands)

Let's have some action, let's

have some asses wiggling, I

want some perfection. Whawhak!

I think I'm going to need a

drink, a strong drink.

(a beat)

Let's get the hell out of

here.

(25) EXT.  STREETS AND ALLEY -- DOWNTOWN -- DAY

MORRIS

This just ain't happening. The

bitches are okay, but we need

something more exciting-

JEROME

You're right.  We could be

doing much better.  Any ideas?

MORRIS

That powder fine babe we saw

last night.

JEROME

Oooh, yeee! -- Why don't we

find out who she is?

MORRIS

I already know that.  Jill

gave me everything last night.

Whawhak!

JEROME

Then what are we waiting for?

Let's go!

MORRIS

No, no -- that ain't classy

enough.  I want the bitch to

come to me -- I'm the only

star in this town.

BABE

(yelling)

Morris Day, who do you think

you are?!  I waited up all

night for you.  I'm so tired

of you doing that  to me. You

think you're so hot?  You're

nothing special.  This is the

third time you pulled that

shit.  Who the fuck do you

think I am?!

MORRIS

Jerome!

BABE

(screaming)

Leave me alone you ape! --

What are you doing to me?!

Morris!!

MORRIS

Lo-rd..!  Such nastiness.

(a beat)

Hee, hee -- Let's break.

MORRIS

Jerome, this car --

it's...it's lacking something.

What do you think?

JEROME

Hmm... I don't know...

MORRIS

I got it!  The hubcaps.  We

need something sweeter.

JEROME

I think I know what it needs.

MORRIS

Yeah ... I know what these

need.

(26) INT.  SHOESHINE STAND -- DOWNTOWN -- DAY

MORRIS

(musing)

The girl has expensive tastes.

I wonder if she can sing.

JEROME

As fine as she is...she

doesn't have to know how to

sing.

MORRIS

(grace)

I know that's right.

(to Shoeshine)

Hey -- watch it now.

MORRIS

I want you to stay out of the

set tonight.  I want you to

work the floor.

JEROME

What for?

MORRIS

I want to know when that sweet

thing shows up.  You stay by

the door, you see her, you

come get me, cool?

JEROME

Cool.  I come get you -- let

you know the girl's there.

MORRIS

Well, not if I'm with my other

babes.  That wouldn't be cool.

I don't want to break their

hearts, and you know how I

feel abouy that.  So we ought

to have like, a signal.

JEROME

A password.

MORRIS

Okay.  What's the password?

JEROME

You got it.

MORRIS

Got what?

JEROME

The password.

MORRIS

The password is what?

JEROME

Exactly.

MORRIS

The password is exactly?

JEROME

No, it's--

MORRIS

-- Hold it now.  Slow down.

The babe walks in and you see

her.

JEROME

I see her.

MORRIS

You come get me.

JEROME

I come get you.

MORRIS

And I'll probably have a

couple little sexies on the

stand-by, and we don't want to

upset them, do we?  So you

just glide by me and

say...what?

JEROME

Okay.

MORRIS

The password is okay?

JEROME

Far as I'm concerned.

MORRIS

Dammit!  Say the password.

JEROME

What.

MORRIS

Say the password, sperm

breath!

JEROME

The password is what.

MORRIS

(frustrated)

That's what I'm asking you!

JEROME

(more frustrated)

It's the password!

MORRIS

The password is it?

JEROME

(exasperated)

Ahhhhh! The password is what!

MORRIS

It!  You just said so!

JEROME

The password isn't it!  The

password is--

MORRIS

-- What?

JEROME

Got it!

MORRIS

PRINCE

Oh, yeah -- what did you play?

VANITY

Isadora Duncan...

VANITY

That means I can sing and

dance.

(a beat)

Want to help me?

PRINCE

Nope.

VANITY

(surprised)

Pardon me?

PRINCE

Nope.

PRINCE

Want to know why?

VANITY

(defensively)

Nope.

What initiation?

PRINCE

Well, for starters ycu have to

purify yourself in the waters

of Lake Minnetonka.

VANITY

What?

PRINCE

You have to purify yourself in

Lake Minnetonka.

PRINCE

Hey, wait a minute! Thats--

VANITY

We made a deal!

PRINCE

Hold it.

VANITY

What?

PRINCE

That ain't Lake Minnetonka.

VANITY

(enraged)

You bastard.  I don't believe

it.  How could you do that to

me?!

VANITY

Damn you -- I'll kill you.

VANITY

That's the last thing you want

from a man.

JILL

You just don't know him like I

do.

KIM

Honey... Look, Listen, and

then Feel.  If you do them in

any other order, you're headed

for trouble.

BOBBY

Hey, Jill -- where's our

drinks?

JILL

They're coming -- just wait.

Oh, that's a really nice

watch. Very pretty.

VANITY

You  look like a guy I used to

go out with -- he was a lot

older, but I like older men.

BILLY

VANITY

I just came off a Broadway

play.  My grandmother got

sick.

BILLY

Does she live here?

No, in New York ...

(catches herself)

But, huh,  I have a sister

here, lives in Saint ... huh

BILLY

VANITY

Amazing.

BILLY

Ye-es.

(smiles)

What do you want to do?  You

don't want to be a waitress do

you?

VANITY

No ... no...Actually I was

thinking more in the way of

the stage.

BILLY

Of course... how about dinner?

VANITY

Theatre?

BILLY

Dinner, then the theatre, my

sweets.

VANITY

Oh, huh...

Hi ya, Billy.

Ye-es.

(33) INT.  DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT

WENDY

Hi  ya, Prince.  I heard

through the grapevine you had

a new tune written by two

great girls.  By chance did

you hear it?

LISA

I knew it -- he didn't listen

to it.  He probably dropped it

under his bike and rolled over

it.

WENDY

Wow! Okay...you think about

this.  I'm going to be real

honest with you.  You're

really being full of shit.

LISA

Forget about it, Wendy.  Let's

get out of here--

WENDY

(to Prince)

Every time we give you a song,

you say you're going to use

it, but you never do.  You

always think that we're doing

something behind your back.

You're just being paranoid as

usual.

LISA

Wendy...

WENDY

(upset)

Shut up, Lisa, please!

(to Prince)

You should know by now that we

wouldn't hurt vou.  We're not

out to put a dark cloud over

your head.  It's just to make

you feel good, Prince --

that's what it's all about.

You've been this way with us

before, remember?

PRINCE

(maliciously)

The nominees for the best

actress are--

LISA

-- Fuck it, Wendy -- let's

break!

WENDY

Do you know you can really,

really hurt people?  Doesn't

that mean anything to you?

Doesn't that make you feel

like shit?

LISA

C'mon ...

WENDY

I'm tired of this ... I'm

really tired...

PRINCE

You tired, too?

MATT

God got Wendy's periods

reversed.  About every 28

days, she starts acting nice.

Lasts about a weekend.

BOBBY

What difference does it make,

Prince.  We're still a group,

right?

(34) INT.  HALLWAY -- NIGHT

MARK

Headcase.  Telling

you...'effed up headcase.

BOBBY

People with talent usually

are.

Of course, there are a number

of headcases without great

talent too.

MORRIS

Honey -- don't you ever try

and breastfeed no baby now.

GIRL

Why not?

MORRIS

Never mind ...

JEROME

MORRIS

MORRIS

time.

PRINCE

She's crying -- it's

backwards.  It makes me sad

when I hear it.  It sorta

sounds like she's laughing,

So what did you do to her? Do

Thank you.  Here you are,

MORRIS

Jerome, uh, get your pad and

pencil, I think it's gonna be

tonight.

(a beat)

Stop me when I get to

MORRIS

Excuse me, baby...I bet you

didn't know I had a piece of

Huh, excuse me, that's kind of

weak...here, try mine.

Good God!

MORRIS

Y'know...they say that saliva

is an aphrodisiac.

(a beat)

You look so lovely tonight.

VANITY

(couching)

Why...thank you.

MORRIS

Probably you'd look better

under exotic...red...liqhts.

(another though)

I wish you could see my home.

It's...it's so exciting.

MORRIS

In my bedroom, I have a brass

waterbed ...

VANITY

Oooh!

MORRIS

I have an Italian cook, Gino

Izogochograchi, or something

like that.

MORRIS

It's funny...your eyes -- when

you stare at me like that, it

causes my stomach to qui-

quiver.  Oh, Lord...

MORRIS

Do you like diamonds?

VANITY

Uh, huh.

MORRIS

Yeah ...?

VANITY

Yeah.

MORRIS

I know it's rather masculine,

but -- try this one on.

VANITY

Ohhh!

MORRIS

My God, darling it fits.

MORRIS

You must have strong hands,

but -- they're so soft...like

oils in my bubble bath.

(a beat)

Damn ...

MORRIS

Darling...?

VANITY

Yeah...?

MORRIS

I'm not usually so forward,

but -- would you like to make

love to me?  I can make it so

nice ...

MORRIS

Do you know what is meant by

the words, huh, I hate to use

them, they're so harsh, so

American...I mean, and yet on

the other hand, they're

exciting words.  The words...

(pause)

...chili sauce.  Oh, Lord.

(a beat)

MORRIS

You know, I haven't made love

in so long, but with you I

know it would be just like

riding a bike.  I'd remember

everything I've ever learned.

(a beat)

Baby, if the kid can't make

you come, nobody can.

JEROME

VANITY

Hey, wait!  C'mon!

(a beat)

Okay -- where are you taking

me?

MORRIS

Home.

You and me are a lot alike.- I

like that.  So, I'd like to

help you out.  I think I have

something you may be

interested,  in.

VANITY

Oh yeah -- what?

MORRIS

A little song and dance.  That

is, if you can sing and dance.

VANITY

(defensively)

Prince is goinq to help me.

JEROME

Motherfucker needs a haircut.

MORRIS

Hee, hee, uh, excuse me.  No

he won't.  He's never done

anything in his whole life for

anybody but himself.

VANITY

Guys better than you have

promised me things before.

MORRIS

I know that's right, but--

MORRIS

(con't)

-- not Morris Day.

Jerome pulls up in front of her motel.

MORRIS

could tell it was you.

PRINCE

How'd you get home?

VANITY

Took a cab.

PRINCE

Oh yeah?  Where'd you get

that?

God, this is beautiful.  It

reminds me of where I grew up.

My father used to ...

PRINCE

Your father used to what...?

VANITY

Nothing...it's just...

(changes subject)

You must like places like

this.

VANITY

So, have you reconsidered my

proposal?

PRINCE

What...?

VANITY

What we talked about last

time.

PRINCE

You can't be serious.

VANITY

Oh, come on -- you know you

really want to.  You've been

waiting for this opportunity

...all...your...life...

PRINCE

I'm sorry -- excuse me.

VANITY

God -- so why do you come

around?  You don't want to

help me, not that you have to.

You don't want to sleep with

me, not that you have to do

that either.  So why am I

here?

VANITY

There's a lot of things you

don't know about me.  You'd be

surprised how many things I

could do.

VANITY

Take me home immediately!  I

want to go home.  I can't

stand this!  I can't take this

anymore!  Prince!

VANITY(O.S.)

I don't need this!  I was

doing alright before I met

you.  Motherfucker, you need a

haircut!

VANITY

(to herself)

I don't get this.

(yells)

Prince! Who do you think you

are?!  You don't care.  You

don't care about anything!  I

never wanted you to help me

anyway!

VANITY (0.S.)

You think you're a good

musician?!  You're nothing!

Morris is better.  I never

wanted to make it with you

anyway.

PRINCE

Good morning.

VANITY

PRINCE, I HATE YOU!

HIKERS

Good morning, sir.

And they walk down the path, disappear around the bend.

Just then--

VANITY

(softly)

I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have

said those things.  Will you

forgive me?

PRINCE

(softly)

Yes.

Chili sauce.

Oh, Lord...

WENDY

WENDY

Is that better? Do you like

that?

PRINCE

Where is everybody?

LISA

You're late -- they left.

PRINCE

So what are you doing here?

LISA

(imitating Prince)

But I'm here to tell you that

there's something else -- our

music--.

PRINCE

Can't you guys get off it?

Can't you just leave it alone?

WENDY

Yeah -- we'll get off it.

FATHER

Don't I keep the heat on?

Isn't there food in the

refrigerator?

MOTHER

(crying)

I don't like it here.  You

overhead...

MOTHER

You don't let me have any

fun...

FATHER

I could make you happy.  Just

believe in me...

MOTHER

You never...

FATHER

I would die for you.

MOTHER

It's nice here.  It's a nice

house.  Nothing wrong.

(a beat)

It's a good family.  Believe

me, I know.  Nothing wrong

here.

(a beat)

Your father is okay.  He's a

good man.  You could learn

somthing.

MOTHER

My, my!  Don't you think I

have a good figure?  Your

Father did.

MOTHER

I was beautiful when your Dad

met me.  I was out-a-sight!

MOTHER

I looked just like a movie

star.  The minute he saw me

singing, I knew just what he

wanted.

MOTHER

He wanted to get into my

panties.

MOTHER

You look so pretty.  Just like

me, honey.  You coulda been a

girl.

MOTHER

So pretty...

MOTHER

(secretly)

I have to go now, see some

friends.  Don't tell your

VANITY

Just...leave me alone.

PRINCE

Please...it's just...

(a beat)

I don't want you around this

at all.  I just don't want you

in my life this way.  You

don't have to prove anything

to me or anybody else.

(a beat)

Vanity...?  Don't I make you

happy?  Don.t you like the way

we are?

(another thought)

Do you know Morris?  Do you

know what he's about? He

doesn't care about you.

BILLY

Morris called me this morning.

Seems he's got himself a new

group called Vanity Six.  You

know anything about them?

PRINCE

(a beat)

No.

BILLY

He tells me they're great.

Thinks I'll be interested.

That's cool, but now I've got

a problem.

PRINCE

What's that?

BILLY

I book three acts -- I can't

afford four.  If they're as

good as Morris says they are,

one of you will have to go...

BILLY

Go around the block!

BILLY

It won't be The Time --

they're playing backup to

Vanity.  So it's either you or

the Modern Aires.

(a beat)

What would You do in my

position?

Prince has a sinking feeling in his gut-

BILLY

(musing)

I like the Modern Aires.  They

have a good following -- they

show up for practice -- and

the kids like all their music.

BILLY

'Nough said.  Get smart.

Straighten up your shit.

(76) INT. REHEARSAL HALL -- DAY

I want to talk to you.

Uh, uh...

VANITY

Leave me alone!  I've got a

show to do!

VANITY

YOU can't just come in here

and take me away!  We'll talk

later!

MORRIS

Man -- why don't you just do

the walk?

PRINCE

Why don't you kiss the one-

eyed snake?

MORRIS

Jellybean!

JELLYBEAN

Let's go, Jack.

PRINCE

Fuck you!

VANITY

Leave me alone, dammit!  Get

out of here!

JELLYBEAN

(enraged)

Fucker!!

JELLYBEAN

Stay still, motherfucker!!

JELLYBEAN

Shit!!

JELLYBEAN

Stop!!

VANITY

Jellybean, please...

Prince drops to his hands and knees exhausted.  Everybody is

frozen now -- scared.  The Girls are crying, the incedent

has already gone too far...

JELLYBEAN

Lift him.

VANITY

(crying)

Don't hurt him ...

SHOPPERS flood the sidewalks, rushing for the buses that

take them home.  TRAFFIC clogs  at the 77 intersections

while PEDESTRIANS walk against the lights.  Prince rides

down the streets, hugging the right shoulder, impatient with

the delays.  He blasts down a side street, sees FLASHING

LIGHTS up ahead.  GAWKERS are already crowding around.

PRINCE

Ma...?

MOTHER

(drunkenly)

Hi, ya, baby...

PRINCE

Ma...what happened?

MOTHER

Can you give me some money?

C'mon, just some money...

C'mon...I'll take you home.

Okay, c'mon now -- break it

up.  Let's go..

FATHER

'Course it's mine.  Who else's

kinds of them.  They're

different too.

PRINCE

I'd like to see them.  You got

them written down somewhere?

FATHER

No, man -- I don't write them

down -- don't need to.  That's

the big difference between you

and me.

PRINCE

Thought you weren't going to

play no more.

PRINCE

I saw Mom up the street.  She

looked pretty bad.  Any idea

how she got that way?

PRINCE

Yeah...

I got a girlfriend.

FATHER

You gonna get married?

Never get married.

MORRIS

What do you mean?

VANITY

I don't want to be here.  I

don't want to hurt anybody.

MORRIS

It's not about hurting

anybody.  This is business.

We can use the exposure.

BRENDA

Hi -- you coming in?

VANITY

Your horns are showing,

Morris.

MORRIS

Yeah...but they're holding up

my halo.

(84) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT

PRINCE

I knew a girl named Nicky,

I guess you can say she was a

sex fiend.

I met her in a hotel lobby

masturbating in magazines.

She said, How'd you like to

waste some time,

And I could not resist

When I saw little Nicky grind.

MORRIS

Hee, hee...little empty

tonight, huh, Billy.  But I

guess money isn't everything.

JEROME

Oh no... that's cold...

BILLY

The Duke of Dick is in rare

form tonight.

PRINCE

She took me to her castle

And I could not believe my

eyes.

She had so many devices

Everything that money could

buy.

She said,

Sign your name on the dotted

line,

The lights went out,

And Nicky started to grind.

PRINCE

I woke up the next morning.

Nicky wasn't there.

I looked all ov'r all I found

Was a phone number on the

stairs.

It said thank you for a funky

time,

Call me up when ev'r you want

to grind.

BILLY

My stage is no place for your

personal shit!

PRINCE

That's life, man.

BILLY

Life my ass, motherfucker!

This is a business, and you're

not too far gone to see that.

(a beat)

I've told you this before.

You're not pulling them in

like you used to.  The only

person who gives a fuck about

your music is yourself.

PRINCE

Fuck off!

BILLY

Just like your old man...

BILLY

Yeah -- you got it.  Tell me

I'm wrong.

(a beat)

You're not blind.  Look around

you.  No one's digging you.

BILLY

Look at your band.  Are they

in here right now?  They're

out there 'cause they can't

stand being in the same room

with you.

(a beat)

What a fucking waste...like

father, like son--

PRINCE

Lay off that!

BILLY

Take your head out of your

ass, Prince, check it out --

unless you like the view up

there.  Your music doesn't

make sense to anyone but

yourself.

JEROME

That was fucked up what you

did man.  Morris doesn't like

it. And being a part of this -

- I don't like it either.

PRINCE

I don't care.

MORRIS

Hee, hee...huh, it's obvious

you don't have what it takes

to be on top.

MORRIS

But to show you that I'm

sympathetic to your problems -

- here's a pass to our show

tomorrow night.  Enjoy it.

girlfriend.  Whawhak!

Why does this have to be

happening to me?  Has it

crossed your mind that we're

about to make the biggest

mistake we've ever made?

JEROME

I don't think it's all that

bad.

MORRIS

That's why I do all the

thinking.

(93) INT. THE TASTE -- NIGHT

as Billy Sparks spots Morris, waves.  Morris manages a weak

smile, offers a half-hearted wave back.  Just then we HEAR a

applauding?  They loved us --

they wanted to rip us apart,

and this is just our first

night.  I can see it now,

we're all going to be big

stars.  I can feel it.

MORRIS

(singing)

Ain't nobody bad like me.

Morris, you're a genius.

MORRIS

Ye-es...

MORRIS

VANITY

Huh, where's Jerome?

MORRIS

MORRIS

I gave him the night off.

VANITY

Why?

Whawhak!

So here we are again.  So this

VANITY

What's your problem now?

What's your main problem?

PRINCE

No problem.  I just wanted to

talk, alright? I just want us

to be okay, to really get

along.  No big deal.

VANITY

No big deal, huh...

PRINCE

Give me that.

VANITY

No, definitely not.  Who are

you?  You can't tell me what

to do.

PRINCE

Please don't drink that.  Give

it to me.

VANITY

You're nothing, Prince,

absolutely nothing.  You think

you're so special --  but deep

down you're just like all the

rest.

(a beat)

Your whole life you've been

hiding, hiding behind your

music.  But now you don't even

have that, because last

night...last night you used it

to hurt someone, someone who

really cares.

VANITY

If you put your hands on me

like that ever again, I'll be

the last person you touch.

VANITY

I  need a  ride.
