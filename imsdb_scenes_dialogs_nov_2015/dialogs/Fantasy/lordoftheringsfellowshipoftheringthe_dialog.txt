GALADRIEL (V.O.)

(Elvish: subtitled)

"I amar prestar sen: han mathon ne nen,

han mathon ne chae...a han noston ned

wilith."

(English:)

The world is changed: I feel it in the

water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it

in the air...Much that once was is lost,

for none now live who remember it.

GALADRIEL (V.O.)

It began with the forging of the Great

Rings.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Three were given to the Elves, immortal,

wisest...fairest of all beings.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great miners

and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And Nine...nine rings were gifted to the

race of Men who, above all else, desire

power.

(CONTINUED)

2.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

For within these rings was bound the

strength and will to govern each race.

FADE TO BLACK

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

But they were all of them deceived.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...for another ring was made.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

In the land of Mordor, in the fires of

Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged

in secret a Master Ring to control all

others.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...and into this Ring he poured his

cruelty, his malice and his will to

dominate all life.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

One Ring to rule them all...

GALADRIEL

One by one the Free lands of Middle earth

fell to the power of the ring.

FADE TO BLACK

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

But there were some...who resisted.

(CONTINUED)

3.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

A last alliance of Men and Elves marched

against the armies of Mordor.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

On the slopes of Mount Doom they fought

for the freedom of Middle- Earth.

GALADRIEL

Victory was near!

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

But the power of the Ring could not be

undone.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It was in this moment..when all hope had

faded, that Isildur, son of the king,

took up his father's sword.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of

Middle Earth, was defeated. SAURON'S

ARMOR clatters to the ground. His body

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The Ring passed to Isildur...who had this

one chance to destroy evil forever.

(CONTINUED)

4.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

But the hearts of Men are easily

corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a

will of its own.

FADE TO BLACK

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It betrayed Isildur to his death.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And some things that should not have been

forgotten...were lost.

FADE TO BLACK

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

History became legend...legend became

myth.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And for two and a half thousand years the

Ring passed out of all knowledge.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Until, when chance came, it ensnared a

new bearer!

GOLLUM (V.O.)

My Precious...

5.

GALADRIEL (V.O.)

The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who

took it deep into the tunnels of the

Misty Mountains.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And there, it consumed him. A RASPY VOICE

mutters in the half light...

GOLLUM

It came to me. My own.     My love...

(ecstatic whisper)

My preciousness.

GALADRIEL (V.O.)

The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long

life. For five hundred years it poisoned

his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's

cave...

FADE TO BLACK

GALADRIEL (V.O.)   (CONT'D)

It waited.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Darkness crept back into the forests of

the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the

East...whispers of a nameless fear. And

the Ring of Power perceived...its time

had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

But something happened then the Ring did

not intend...

FADE TO BLACK

6.

GALADRIEL

It was picked up by the most unlikely

creature imaginable...

BILBO

(to himself)

What's this?

GALADRIEL (V.O.)

A Hobbit....Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

BILBO

(surprised)

A Ring.

GOLLUM (V.O.)

Lost!   Lost! My Precious is lost!!

DISSOLVE TO:

GALADRIEL (V.O.)

For the time will soon come when Hobbits

will shape the fortunes of all.

FRODO

You're late.

GANDALF

A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,

nor is he early. He arrives precisely

when he means to.

FRODO

It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

GANDALF

You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle

Bilbo's birthday?

CUT TO:

8.

FRODO

What news of the outside world? Tell me

everything!

ANGLE ON:

GANDALF

What, everything? Far too eager and

curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...

GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Well, what can I tell you? Life in the

wide world goes on much as if it has past

age. Full of its own comings and goings,

scarcely even aware of the existence of

Hobbits...

GANDALF (CONT'D)

...for which I am very thankful.

ANGLE ON:

GANDALF (CONT'D)

Ah, the long expected party. So, how is

the old rascal? I hear it's going to be

a Party of Special Magnificence.

FRODO

You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place

in an uproar.

GANDALF

Oh, well...that should please him.

(CONTINUED)

9.

FRODO

Half the Shire's been invited...

GANDALF

Good gracious, me.

FRODO

He's up to something.

GANDALF

Oh, really?

FRODO

Alright then..keep your secrets. Before

you came along we Bagginses were very

well thought of.

GANDALF

Indeed?

FRODO

Never had any adventures or did anything

unexpected.

GANDALF

If you're referring to the incident with

the Dragon...I was barely involved...all

I did was give your Uncle a little nudge

out the door.

FRODO

Whatever you did...you've been officially

labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.

Oh, really?

No, thank you! We don't want any more

visitors, well wishers, or distant

And what about very old friends?

BILBO

Gandalf?

GANDALF

Bilbo Baggins!

BILBO

My dear Gandalf!

GANDALF

It's good to see you. One hundred and

eleven years old, who would believe it!

GANDALF (CONT'D)

You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo

laugh together and enter Bag End.

BILBO

Come on, come in!   Welcome, welcome!!

CUT TO:

BILBO

(Calling)

Tea? Or maybe something stronger... I've

a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,

1296...a very good year, almost as old as

I am. It was laid down by my father. What

say we open one, eh?

BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)

I was expecting you some time last week.

Not that it matters, you come and go as

you please, always have done, always

will.

BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)

You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm

afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit

of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no,

that might be a little risky...

BILBO (CONT'D)

Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple

tart...got some custard somewhere. Not

much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh

no...we're alright...I've just found some

sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope

it's enough.

(comes into view)

I could do you some eggs if you like?

GANDALF

Just tea, thank you.

BILBO

Oh..right.     You don't mind if...?

GANDALF

No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud

knock on the front door.

BILBO

I'm not home.

BILBO (CONT'D)

I've got to get away from these

confounded relatives, hanging on the bell

all day, never giving me a moment's

peace. I want to see mountains

again...mountains, Gandalf... and then

find somewhere quiet where I can finish

my book...Oh, Tea!

GANDALF

So, you mean to go through with your

plan, then?

(CONTINUED)

13.

BILBO

Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the

arrangements are made.

GANDALF

Frodo suspects something.

BILBO

'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not

some block headed Bracegirdle from

Hardbottle!

GANDALF

You will tell him, won't you?

BILBO

Yes, yes.

GANDALF

He's very fond of you.

BILBO

I know. He'd probably come with me if I

asked him. I think, in his heart,

Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the

woods and the fields... little rivers.

Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen

window.

BILBO (CONT'D)

I am old, Gandalf... Bilbo looks at

Gandalf sadly...

BILBO (CONT'D)

I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning

to feel it in my heart.

CLOSE ON:

BILBO (CONT'D)

I feel thin...sort of stretched, like

butter scraped over too much bread. I

need a holiday...a very long holiday and

I don't expect I shall return...in fact,

I mean not to.

CUT TO:

BILBO

Old Toby, the finest weed in

Southfarthing!

BILBO (CONT'D)

Ohhhh,

Gandalf my old friend...this will be a

night to remember!

FRODO

Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.

SAM

(horrified)

I think I'll just have myself another

ale.

FRODO

Oh, no you don't. Go on.

ANGLE ON:

BILBO

(melodramatic)

So, there I was...at the mercy of three

monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of

a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?

Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly

things..and they're arguing...arguing

about how they were going to cook us!

BILBO

Whether it be turned on a spit or minced

in a pie or whether they were going to

sit on us one by one and squash us into

jelly! But they spent so long arguing

the whether-to's and why-for's that the

sun's first light crept over the top of

the trees...and turned them all to stone!

No, no..the big one...the big one! Pippin

PIPPIN

It was your idea.

FRODO

Bilbo!   Watch out for the dragon!!

That was good!

My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and

Brandybucks...Grubbs, Chubbs,

Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and

Proudfoots...

ODO PROUDFOOT

Proudfeet!

BILBO

Today is my one hundred and eleventh

birthday. Yes, and alas...Eleventy- one

years is far too short a time to live

among such excellent and admirable

Hobbits! Tremendous outburst of approval!

BILBO (CONT'D)

I don't know half of you half as well as

I should like; and I like less than half

of you as well as well as you deserve.

(CONTINUED)

18.

BILBO (CONT'D)

I have..things to do and I have put this

off for far too long... CLOSE ON: BILBO'S

knuckles turn white as he tightens his

grip on the small object behind his back.

BILBO (CONT'D)

I regret to announce, this is the end. I

am going now. I bid you all a very fond

farewell!! Bilbo looks across at Frodo,

hesitates... then...

BILBO (CONT'D)

(whisper)

Goodbye.

CUT TO:

ANGLE ON:

GANDALF

I suppose you think that was terribly

clever?

BILBO

Come on, Gandalf!   Did you see their

faces?

(CONTINUED)

19.

GANDALF

There are many magic rings in the world,

Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be

used lightly.

BILBO

It was just a bit of fun.   Oh, you're

probably right as usual.

GANDALF

You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

BILBO

I'm leaving everything to him.

GANDALF

What about this ring of yours?   Is that

staying too?

BILBO

Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over

there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns

at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly

feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty

surprise.

BILBO (CONT'D)

No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't

that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after

all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?

GANDALF

I think you should leave the Ring behind,

Bilbo. Is that so hard?

BILBO

Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it,

I don't feel like parting with it. It's

mine. I found it. It came to me!

GANDALF

There's no need to get angry.

BILBO

Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's

mine. My own, my precious.

(CONTINUED)

20.

GANDALF

Precious? It's been called that before,

but not by you.

BILBO

So? What business is it of yours what I

do with my own things? Bilbo's voice,

shape and manner have suddenly changed.

GANDALF

I think you've had that ring quite long

enough.

BILBO

You want it for yourself!

GANDALF

Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some

conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers

from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a

frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression

softens.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

I am not trying to rob you. I am trying

to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to

Gandalf and hugs him.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

All you long years we've been

friends...trust me as you once did. Let

it go!

BILBO

You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go

to Frodo.

BILBO (CONT'D)

It's late, the road is long... yes, it is

time.

GANDALF

Bilbo?

BILBO

Hmmm?

(CONTINUED)

21.

GANDALF

The ring is still in your pocket.

BILBO

Oh, yes.

ANGLE ON:

BILBO

I've thought up and ending for my

book..."And he lived happily ever after

to the end of his days."

GANDALF

I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

BILBO

Goodbye, Gandalf.

GANDALF

Goodbye Bilbo.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

Until our next meeting.

Bilbo! Bilbo!

GANDALF

My precious...precious..

FRODO

(quietly)

He's gone, hasn't he? Frodo steps into

the living room.

FRODO (CONT'D)

He talked for so long about leaving...I

didn't think he'd really do it.

GANDALF

(mutters to himself)

...my own.

FRODO

Gandalf?

GANDALF

Bilbo's ring.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's

left you Bag End...

GANDALF (CONT'D)

...along with all his possessions.

(CONTINUED)

23.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

The ring is yours now. But it somewhere

out of sight. Gandalf rises hurriedly and

starts to gather his things.

FRODO

Where are you going?

GANDALF

I have some things I must see to.

FRODO

What things?

GANDALF

Questions.     Questions that need

answering.

FRODO

You've only just arrived!    I don't

understand...

Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it

GANDALF (CONT'D)

What can you see? Can you see anything?

FRODO

Nothing...there's nothing.   Wait...

(CONTINUED)

27.

GANDALF

...these are markings.

FRO DO

It's some form of Elvish...I can't read

it.

GANDALF

(ominous)

There are few who can...the language is

that of Mordor, which I will not utter

here.

FRODO

GANDALF

CUT TO:

GANDALF

This is the one ring forged by the dark

lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mt

Doom...taken by Isildur from the hand of

Sauron himself.

FRODO

(quiet realization)

Bilbo found it...in Gollom's cave.

GANDALF

For sixty years the ring lay quiet in

Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life,

delaying old age...but no longer, Frodo.

Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has

awoken. It has heard its master's call.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

AT THAT MOMENT: A FLEETING, LOW WHISPER

of BLACK SPEECH

FRODO

But he was destroyed...Sauron was

destroyed.

GANDALF

No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has

endured. His life force is bound to the

ring and the ring survived. Sauron has

returned. His Orcs have multiplied...his

fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the

land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this

ring to cover all the lands in the second

darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,

all his thought is bent on it. For the

ring yearns, above all else, to return to

the hand of its master: they are one, the

ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must

never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up

the Ring.

FRODO

Alright!

CUT TO:

FRODO

(thinking fast)

We put it away, we keep it hidden! We

never speak of it again. No one know

it's here, do they? Gandalf shifts

uncomfortably.

FRODO (CONT'D)

Do they, Gandalf?

(CONTINUED)

GANDALF

There is one other who knew that Bilbo

had the Ring. I looked everywhere for

the creature Gollum, but the enemy found

him first.

CUT TO:

GANDALF (V.O.)

I don't know how long they tortured

him...but amidst the endless screams and

inane babble, they discerned two words.

GOLLUM

S...Shire! Baggins!

FRODO

Shire!   Baggins!   That will lead them

here!

HOBBIT BOUNDER

Halt!    Who goes there?

FRODO

Take it!   Take it!

(CONTINUED)

GANDALF

No, Frodo...

FRODO

You must take it.

GANDALF

You cannot offer me this ring.

FRODO

I'm giving it to you!

GANDALF

Don't tempt me, Frodo. I dare not take

it, not even to keep it safe.

GANDALF

Understand, Frodo...I would use this Ring

from a desire to do good...but through

me, it would wield a power too great and

terrible to imagine.

FRODO

But it cannot stay in the Shire!

GANDALF

No, no it can't.

FRODO

What must I do?

CUT TO:

GANDALF

You must leave, and leave quickly. Get

out of the Shire.

FRODO

Where?   Where shall I go?

GANDALF

Make for the village of Bree.

(CONTINUED)

31.

FRODO

Bree?   What about you?

GANDALF

I will, be waiting for you at the Inn of

the Prancing Pony. Frodo packs his food

into his knapsack.

FRODO

And the ring will be safe there?

GANDALF

I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any

answers. I must see the Head of my

Order. He is both wise and powerful.

Trust me, Frodo. He'll know what to go.

CUT TO:

GANDALF

You'll have to leave the name of Baggins

behind you...for that name is not safe

outside the Shire. GANDALF helps FRODO

into his coat.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

Travel only by day and stay off the road.

FRODO

(thinking)

I can cut across country easily enough.

GANDALF

My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing

creatures. You can learn all that there

is to know about their ways in a month,

and yet, after a hundred years, they can

still surprise you.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

Get down!

(CONTINUED)

32.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

(angry)

Confound it all! Samwise Gamgee, have

you been eavesdropping?

SAM

I ain't been dropping no eaves, sir!

Honest. I was just cutting the grass

under the window there, if you follow

me...

GANDALF

It's a little late for trimming the

hedges, don't you think?

SAM

I heard raised voices...

GANDALF

What did you hear?   Speak!

SAM

(panicked)

Nothing important...that is, I heard a

good deal about a ring...and a Dark Lord.

And something about the end of the world,

but...Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't

hurt me! Don't turn me into anything

unnatural!

GANDALF

No?

GANDALF

Perhaps not. I've thought of a better

use for you.

CUT TO:

33.

GANDALF (V.O.)

Come along, Samwise...keep up...

GANDALF (V.O.)

Be careful, both of you. The Enemy has

many spies in his service, many ways of

hearing...birds, beasts...

GANDALF (CONT'D)

(low voice)

Is it safe?

GANDALF (CONT'D)

Never put it on, for then the agents of

the Dark Lord will be drawn to its

power...Always remember, Frodo, the ring

is trying to get back to its master...it

wants to be found. Gandalf wheels his

horse and gallops away.

SAM

If I take one more step it'll be the

FRODO

Come on, Sam.

FRODO

Remember what Bilbo used to say...it's a

dangerous business...

BILBO (V.O.)

... it's a dangerous business, Frodo,

going out your door...you step onto the

road, and if you don't keep your feet,

there's not knowing where you might be

swept off to.

CUT TO:

SARUMAN (V.O.)

Smoke rises once more from the mountain

of doom...the shadow takes shape in the

darkness of Mordor; the hour grows

late...and Gandalf the Grey rides to

Isengard seeking my counsel...

35.

SARUMAN

For that is why you have come, is it not,

my old friend?

GANDALF

Saruman!

CUT TO:

SARUMAN

Are you sure of this?

GANDALF

Beyond any doubt.

SARUMAN

So the ring of power has been found?

GANDALF

All these long years it was in the Shire,

under my very nose.

SARUMAN

And yet you did not have the wit to see

it! Your love of the Halfling's leaf has

clearly slowed your mind.

GANDALF

We still have time...time enough to

counter Sauron...if we act quickly.

SARUMAN

Time?   What time do you think we have?

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

36.

SARUMAN

Sauron has regained much of his former

strength. He cannot yet take physical

form...but his spirit has lost none of

its potency. Concealed within his

fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all.

His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth,

and flesh. You know of what I speak,

Gandalf...a great Eye, lidless, wreathed

in flame.

GANDALF

(softly)

The eye of Sauron.

SARUMAN

He is gathering all evil to him.

SARUMAN (CONT'D)

Very soon he will have summoned an army

great enough to launch an assault upon

Middle earth.

GANDALF

You know this? How?

SARUMAN

I have seen it.

GANDALF

A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

SARUMAN

Why?   Why should we fear to use it?

GANDALF

They are not all accounted for, the lost

seeing-stones...we do not know who else

may be watching. Gandalf throws the cloth

back over the Palantir.

(CONTINUED)

37.

SARUMAN

The hour is later than you think.

Sauron's forces are already moving...the

Nine have left Minas Morgul.

GANDALF

(shocked)

The nine!

SARUMAN

They crossed the river Isen in

Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in

black.

GANDALF

(alarmed)

They have reached the Shire? Saruman

shrugs...

SARUMAN

They will find the ring...and kill the

one who carries it.

SARUMAN (CONT'D)

You did not seriously think a Hobbit

could contend with the will of Sauron?

There are none who can.

SARUMAN (CONT'D)

Against the power of Mordor, there can be

no victory. We must join with him,

Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It

would be wise, my friend.

GANDALF

(deadly)

Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the

wise abandon reason for madness?

(CONTINUED)

38.

SARUMAN

I gave you the chance of aiding me

willingly, but you have elected the way

of pain.

CUT TO:

SAM

(panicked)

Mr. Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo turns,

surprised as Sam comes running towards

him.

SAM (CONT'D)

(worried)

I thought I lost you. Frodo looks at Sam

suspiciously. Sam glances down,

embarrassed.

FRODO

(teasing)

What are you talking about?

SAM

(mumbling)

It's just something Gandalf said...

FRODO

What did he say?

SAM

He said..."Don't you leave him, Samwise

Gamgee."

(looks at Frodo intently)

And I don't mean to.

FRODO

(laughing)

Sam...we're still in the Shire...what

could possibly happen?

(CONTINUED)

39.

PIPPIN

Frodo!   Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.

MERRY

Hello Frodo

SAM

What's the meaning of this!

MERRY

Sam, hold this...

SAM

(accusing)

You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

FARMER MAGGOT    (O.S.)

Who's that in my field!     Get out of it!

Get out of my field, you    young varmits!

I'll show you...get out    of my corn.

MERRY

(looking behind him)

I don't know why he's so upset, it's only

a couple of carrots.

PIPPIN

And some cabbages...and those three bags

of potatoes that we lifted last week.

And then the mushrooms the week before.

MERRY

Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly

over reacting.

(CONTINUED)

40.

PIPPIN

Run!

CUT TO:

PIPPIN

That was close.

MERRY

(groaning)

Ow...I think I've broken something.

MERRY (CONT'D)

Oh.

SAM

(turning on Merry and Pippin)

Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.

MERRY

What? That was just a detour...a

shortcut.

SAM

A shortcut to what?

PIPPIN

(excited)

Mushrooms!

41.

FRODO

I think we should get off the road.

FRODO (CONT'D)

(more urgency)

Get off the road!

SAM

Frodo?

(CONTINUED)

42.

MERRY

What was that?

SAM

Anything?

FRODO

Nothing.

PIPPIN

What is going on?

MERRY

The Black rider was looking for

something...or someone...Frodo?

SAM

Get down!

FRODO

I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I

must get to Bree.

MERRY

Right...Buckleberry Ferry...follow me !

MERRY (CONT'D)

There's another one!! Frodo, this way! !

QUICK CUTS:

MERRY (CONT'D)

Frodo, follow me!

MERRY

Get the ropes, Sam.

SAM

Frodo!

FRODO

How far to the nearest crossing?

MERRY

The brandwine bridge...twenty miles.

CLOSE ON:

FRODO

Come on.

GATEKEEPER

What do you want?

FRODO

We're headed for the prancing pony.

GATEKEEPER

Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what's more,

out of the Shire by your talk. What

business brings you to Bree?

FRODO

We wish to stay at the inn...our business

is our own. To Frodo's relief, the

Gatekeeper unlocks the gate.

GATEKEEPER

All right, young sir, I meant no offense.

GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)

It's my job to ask questions after

nightfall. There's talk of strange fold

abroad...can't be too careful.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

45.

CUT TO:

FRODO

Excuse me.

BUTTERBUR

Good evening, little masters. If you're

seeking accommodation, we've got some

nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms available,

Mr...ah...

FRODO

Underhill...my name's Underbill.

BUTTERBUR

Underhill?     Hmmmm.

FRODO

We're friends of Gandalf the Grey...can

you tell him we've arrived? BUTTERBUR

frowns...

BUTTERBUR

(Puzzled)

Gandalf...Gandalf...Oh...

(recognition)

Oh yes! I remember...elderly chap...big

grey beard...pointy hat? Frodo nods with

relief...Butterbur shakes his head.

BUTTERBUR (CONT'D)

Not seen him for six months. Frodo is

shocked.

SAM

(worried whisper)

What do we do now?

(CONTINUED)

46.

FRODO

Sam, he'll be here.    He'll come.

PIPPIN

What's that?

MERRY

This, my friend, is a pint.

PIPPIN

It comes in pints?    I'm getting one!

SAM

You've had a whole half already. Merry

watches Pippin go.

SAM (CONT'D)

(tense)

That fellow's done nothing but stare at

you since we've arrived.

FRODO

Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is

he?

BUTTERBUR

He's one of them Rangers; they're

dangerous folk they are, wandering the

wilds. What his right name is, I never

heard, but round here he's known as

Strider.

FRODO

(to himself)

Strider.

47.

PIPPIN

Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins...he's

over there...

PIPPIN

(loudly)

Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin

once removed, on his mother's side and my

third cousin twice removed on his

father's side...if you follow me.

FRODO

Pippin!

PIPPIN

Steady on, Frodo!

IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

ANGLE ON:

CUT TO:

STRIDER

You draw far too much attention to

yourself...Mr. Underhill

CUT TO:

FRODO

What do you want?

STRIDER

A little more caution from you...that is

no trinket you carry.

FRODO

I carry nothing.

(CONTINUED)

49.

STRIDER

Indeed? I can usually avoid being seen

if I wish, but to disappear entirely...

that is a rare gift.

FRODO

Who are you?

STRIDER

Are you frightened?

FRODO

Yes.

STRIDER

Not nearly frightened enough. I know

what hunts you. Frodo jumps at the sound

of a noise in the corridor. Strider

deftly draws his sword.

SAM

(angry)

Let him go or I'll have you, Longshanks!

STRIDER

You have a stout heart, little Hobbit,

but that alone won't save you...You can

no longer wait for the Wizard, Frodo.

They're coming.

CUT TO:

50.

CUT TO:

FRODO

Where are they?

STRIDER

They were once men. Strider glances

quickly at Frodo, then looks away...

(CONTINUED)

51.

STRIDER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

(quietly)

Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the

deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of

Power. Blinded by their greed they took

them without question, one by one falling

into darkness and now they are slaves to

his will.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

They are the Nazgul, Ringwraiths, neither

living or dead. At all times they feel

the presence of the ring...drawn to the

power of the one..they will never stop

hunting you.

CUT TO:

ANGLE ON:

FRODO

Where are you taking us?

STRIDER

Into the wild.

MERRY

(whispered aside)

How do, we know this Strider is a friend

of Gandalf?

FRODO

We have no choice but to trust him.

STRIDER

But where is he leading us?

ANGLE ON:

(CONTINUED)

52.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

To Rivendell, Master Gamgee...to the

house of Elrond.

SAM

Did you hear that, Bill? Rivendell!

We're going to see the Elves!

CUT TO:

STRIDER

Gentlemen, we do not stop until

nightfall.

PIPPIN

What about breakfast?

STRIDER

You've already had it.

PIPPIN

We've had one, yes...but what about

Second Breakfast?

MERRY

I don't think he knows about second

breakfast, Pip.

PIPPIN

What about Elvenses, Luncheon, Afternoon

Tea, dinner...he knows about them,

doesn't he?

MERRY

I wouldn't count on it.

The power of Isengard is at your command,

Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

does the eye command?

SARUMAN

We have work to do.

There are for you. Keep them close. I'm

What are you doing?

MERRY

Tomatoes, sausages, and crispy bacon.

SAM

We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.

FRODO

Put it out, you fools! Put it out! Frodo

Oh, that's nice...ash on my tomatoes!

Frodo!

SAM (CONT'D)

Mr. Frodo!!

SAM (CONT'D)

Help him, Strider!

STRIDER

(grim)

He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade. The

Morgul Blade suddenly melts...vanishing

into the air like smoke. Strider throws

the hilt down in disgust...

(CONTINUED)

57.

SAM

Do something.

STRIDER

This is beyond my skill to heal.

(urgently)

He needs Elvish medicine. Strider lifts

Frodo onto his shoulders.

STRIDER

Hurry!

SAM

We are six days from Rivendell. Frodo

groans.

STRIDER

Hold on, Frodo.

SAM

He'll never make it! Close on:

Frodo...head lolling about, barely

conscious.

FRODO

(fevered calling)

Gandalf...Gandalf?

CUT TO:

PIPPIN

Is he going to die? Frodo's breathing is

getting shallow. Strider looks out into

the darkness.

STRIDER

No. He is passing into the shadow world,

he will soon become a wraith like them.

MERRY

(nervous)

They're close.

STRIDER

(thinking hard)

Sam, do you know the Athelas plant? Sam

looks blank.

SAM

Athelas?

Kingsfoil.

Kingsfoil.     Aye.    It's a weed.

It may help to slow the poison. Hurry!

Frodo?

She's an elf.

ARWEN

He's fading...he's not gong to last. We

horse.

ARWEN (CONT'D)

I have been looking for you for two days.

Where are you taking him?

There are five Wraiths behind you, where

the other four are, I do not know.

ARWEN (V.O.)

What grace is given me, let it pass to

FRODO

(frightened)

Where am I?

GANDALF (O.S.)

You are in the House of Elrond, and it is

ten o'clock in the morning on October the

twenty-fourth, if you want to know.

FRODO

(weak relief)

Gandalf!

64.

GANDALF

Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be

here, too. A few more hours and you

would have been beyond our aid. You have

some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.

FRODO

What happened, Gandalf?    Why didn't you

meet us?

GANDALF

I'm sorry Frodo.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

I was delayed.

CUT TO:

SARUMAN

Get up! So much for the power of the

Ring or embrace your own destruction!

GANDALF

There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only

one who can bend it to his will...and he

does not share power.

SARUMAN

(chilling)

So you have chosen death!

CUT TO:

65.

CUT TO:

FRODO

Gandalf! What is it? Gandalf returns his

attention to Frodo.

GANDALF

Nothing, Frodo...

SAM

Frodo!   Frodo!   Bless you, you're awake!!

GANDALF

Sam has hardly left your side.

SAM

We were worried about you--weren't we,

Mr. Gandalf?

GANDALF

By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're

beginning to mend. ELROND, LORD OF THE

HIGH ELVES, steps up to Frodo's

ELROND

Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

Frodo sits up, looking at Elrond with

awe.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

66.

ELROND (V.O.)

You have found your way to the last

homely house east of the sea. The elves

of Imladris have dwelt within this valley

for three thousand years through few of

my kin now remain. Frodo looks out from

his balcony.

MERRY

Frodo!   Frodo!

FRODO

Bilbo!

BILBO

Hello, Frodo, my lad!

FRODO

Bilbo!

FRODO (CONT'D)

(reading)

"There and back again: A Hobbit's tale"

by Bilbo Baggins.

(CONTINUED)

67.

FRODO (CONT'D)

This is wonderful.

BILBO

I meant to go back...wander the paths of

Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely

Mountain again...but age, it seems, has

finally caught up with me.

FRODO

(quietly)

I miss the Shire...I spent all my

childhood pretending I was off somewhere

else...off with you, on one of your

adventures...

(Looks at Bilbo)

But my own adventure, turned out to be

quite different...I'm not like you,

Bilbo.

BILBO

My dear boy...

CUT TO:

SAM

No, what have I forgotten? Pull back to

reveal Frodo, hands in his pocket,

watching Sam.

FRODO

Packed already?

SAM

(slightly embarrassed)

No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls

to the edge of the Balcony.

FRODO

I thought you wanted to see the Elves,

Sam?

(CONTINUED)

68.

SAM

I do...

FRODO

More than anything.

SAM

I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf

wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this

far, to Rivendell...and I thought...

seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be

off soon. Off home.

FRODO

You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam...

FRODO (CONT'D)

...we did what we set out to do. Frodo

opens his hand, the Ring sits in his

Palm.

FRODO (CONT'D)

The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am

ready to go home.

CUT TO:

ELROND

His strength returns.

GANDALF

That wound will never fully heal. He will

carry it the rest of his life.

ELROND

And yet to have come so far still bearing

the Ring...the hobbit has shown

extraordinary resilience to its evil.

GANDALF

It is a burden he should never have to

had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.

ELROND

Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's

forces are massing in the east. His eye

is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you

tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of

allies grows thin.

(CONTINUED)

69.

GANDALF

His treachery runs deeper than you know.

By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc

with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army

in the caverns of Isengard. An army that

can move in Sunlight and cover great

distance at speed. Saruman is coming for

the Ring.

ELROND

This evil cannot be concealed by the

power of the Elves...We do not have the

strength to fight both Mordor and

Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay

here.

ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)

This peril belongs to all Middle earth.

They must decide how to end it. Not just

for themselves but for those who come

after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.

ELROND (CONT'D)

The time of the Elves is over. My people

are leaving these shores. Who will you

look to when we have gone? The dwarves?

They hide in their mountains seeking

riches. They care nothing for the

troubles of others.

GANDALF

It is in Men that we must place our hope.

ELROND

Men? Men are weak.      The race of Men is

failing. The blood     of Numenor is all but

spent, its pride and    dignity forgotten.

It is because of men    the Ring survives.

ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I was there, Gandalf...I was there three

thousand years ago when Isildur took the

ring.

70.

ELROND

I was there the day the strength of Men

failed.

CUT TO:

ELROND

Isildur...hurry...follow me! IMAGES:

ELROND leads Isildur into the steaming

volcano.

ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I let Isildur into the heart of Mount

Doom, where the ring was forged: the one

place it could be destroyed.

ELROND

Cast it into the fire...destroy it!

ISILDUR

No.

ELROND

Isildur!!

ELROND

It should have ended that day, but evil

was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the

Ring...and the line of Kings was broken.

There's no strength left in the world of

Men. They're scattered, divided,

leaderless.

(CONTINUED)

71.

GANDALF

There is one who could unite them, one

who could re claim the thrown of Gondor.

ELROND

He turned from that path a long time ago.

He has chosen exile.

CUT TO:

BOROMIR

(quiet awe)

The shards of Narsil...the blade that cut

the Ring from Sauron's hand. Boromir

picks up the sword and gently touches the

Blade. Close on: a small bloom of blood

appears on Boromir's finger...

BOROMIR (CONT'D)

Still sharp.

BOROMIR (CONT'D)

But no more than a broken heirloom.

BOROMIR (CONT'D)

replaces the Broken blade, but it

clatters to the floor. Boromir walks

away, leaving Strider sitting alone.

ARWEN

Why do you fear the past? You are

Isildur's heir...not Isildur himself. You

are not bound to his fate.

STRIDER

The same blood flows in my veins...the

same weakness...

(CONTINUED)

72.

ARWEN

Your time will come. You will face the

same evil...and you will defeat it.

Nauthannim I ned ol reniannen.   I thought

I had strayed into a dream.

ARWEN

ARWEN (CONT'D)

Renech I Beth I pennen? Do you remember

what I told you? Arwen reaches for

Strider's hand...

STRIDER

(quietly)

You said you'd bind yourself to me,

forsaking the immortal life of your

people.

(CONTINUED)

73.

ARWEN

(whisper)

And to that I hold. I would rather share

one lifetime with you than face all the

ages of this world alone. Strider looks

down. In his hand lies the Evenstar.

ARWEN (CONT'D)

I choose a mortal live.

STRIDER

You cannot give me this.

ARWEN

It is mine to give to whom I will, like

my heart.

CUT TO:

ELROND

Strangers from distant lands ... friends

of old. You have been summoned here to

answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth

stands upon the brink of destruction.

None can escape it. You will unite...or

you will fall. Each race is bound to this

fate...this one doom...

ELROND (CONT'D)

Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

BOROMIR

(shocked)

So it is true!

LEGOLAS

(disbelief)

Sauron's Ring! The ring of power!

(CONTINUED)

74.

GIMLI

(grim)

The doom of man!

BOROMIR

It is a gift...a gift to the foes of

Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has

my father, the Steward of Gondor, held

the forces of Mordor at bay...by the

blood of our people are your lands kept

safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the

enemy...let us use it against him!

STRIDER

You cannot wield it. None of us can.

The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it

has no other master. Boromir turns and

looks at Strider, coolly.

BOROMIR

And what would a ranger know of this

matter?

LEGOLAS

This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,

son of Arathorn. You owe him your

allegiance.

BOROMIR

(quiet disbelief)

Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

LEGOLAS

And heir to the throne of Gondor.

ARAGORN

(Elvish: with subtitles)

Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas..

BOROMIR

Gondor needs no king.

GANDALF

Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.

ELROND

You have only one choice..the ring must

be destroyed.

(CONTINUED)

75.

GIMLI

Then...what are we waiting for?

ELROND

The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son

of Gloin, by any craft that we

ELROND (CONT'D)

here possess. The ring was made in the

fires of Mount Doom...only there can it

be unmade. It must be taken deep into

Mordor, and cast back into the fiery

chasm from whence it came. One of you

must do this.

BOROMIR

One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its

black gates are guarded by more than just

Orcs. There is evil there that does not

sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.

It is a barren wasteland, riddled with

fire and ash and dust...the very air you

breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with

ten thousand men could you do this. It

is folly.

LEGOLAS

Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has

said? The ring must be destroyed.

GIMLI

And I suppose you think you're the one to

do it?

BOROMIR

And if we fail, what then? What happens

when Sauron takes back what is his?

(CONTINUED)

76.

GIMLI

I will be dead before I see the Ring in

the hands of an Elf! A STORM OF ARGUMENT

erupts around the room. CLOSE ON:

FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in

slow

GIMLI (CONT'D)

(shouting)

Never trust an Elf!

GANDALF

Do you not understand? While we    bicker

among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows!

No one will escape it. You will   all be

destroyed, your homes burnt and   your

families put to the sword!

FRODO

I will take it...I will take it...I will

take the Ring to Mordor.

FRODO (CONT'D)

(quietly)

Though...I do not know the way. Gandalf

rises to his feet.

GANDALF

I will help you bear this burden, Frodo

Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.

ARAGORN

If, by my life or death, I can protect

you, I will.

(kneels before Frodo)

...you have my sword. Aragorn steps

forward...followed by Legolas and Gimli.

(CONTINUED)

77.

LEGOLAS

And you have my bow.

GIMLI

And my axe.

BOROMIR

You carry the fate of us all, little one.

BOROMIR (CONT'D)

If this is indeed the will of the

Council, then Gondor will see it done.

SAM

(unseen)

Here!

SAM (CONT'D)

Mr. Frodo's not gong anywhere without me.

ELROND

No, Indeed...it is hardly possible to

separate you...even when he is summoned

to a secret council and you are not.

MERRY

Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to

send us home tied up in a sack to stop

us.

PIPPIN

Anyway...you need people of intelligence

on this sort of

mission...quest...thing...

MERRY

Well, that rules you out, Pip.

78.

ELROND

(thoughtfully)

Nine companions ... so be it.

(announcing)

You shall be the "Fellowship of the ring"

PIPPIN

Great.   Where are we going?

CUT TO:

BILBO

My old sword "Sting"...here, take it!

FRODO

It's so light!

BILBO

Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.

The blade glows blue when Orcs are

close...and it's times like that, my lad,

when you have to be extra careful.

BILBO (CONT'D)

Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light

as a feather, and as hard as dragon

scales. Let me see you put it on. Come

on.

BILBO (CONT'D)

(entranced)

Oh! My old Ring... Frodo frowns as Bilbo

moves toward him.

BILBO (CONT'D)

I should very much like to hold it again,

one last time. Bilbo reaches forward,

eyes locked on the ring.

(CONTINUED)

79.

BILBO (CONT'D)

Oh!

BILBO (CONT'D)

(sad)

I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you,

my boy...I'm sorry that you must carry

this burden. I'm sorry for everything.

ANGLE ON:

CUT TO:

ANGLE ON:

GANDALF (V.O.)

We must hold to his course west of the

misty Mountains for forty days. If our

luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still

be open to us. From there, our road

turns east, to Mordor.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

80.

BOROMIR

Get away from the blade, Pippin...on your

toes...good, very good...I want you to

react, not think.

SAM

Should not be too hard...

BOROMIR

Move your feet.

MERRY

Quite good, Pippin.

PIPPIN

Thanks.

GIMLI

If anyone were to ask for my opinion,

which I note they have not, I would say

we are taking the long way round.

Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of

Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a

royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks

that is a bad idea.

GANDALF

No, Gimli. I would not take the road

through Moria unless I had no other

choice.

SAM

What is that?

GIMLI

Nothing...it's just a wisp of a cloud.

BOROMIR

(worried)

It's moving fast...against the wind.

LEGOLAS

Crebain from Dunland!

(CONTINUED)

81.

ARAGORN

(urgently)

Hide!

BOROMIR

Merry..Pippin...Sam...take cover! WIDE

ON: THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what

little cover

GANDALF

(worried)

Spies of Saruman.    The passage South is

being watched.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

We must take the pass of Caradhras!

CUT TO:

ANGLE ON:

ARAGORN

Boromir?

BOROMIR

It is a strange fate that we should

suffer so much fear and doubt over so

small a thing...such a little thing.

ARAGORN

(quietly)

Boromir...give the ring to Frodo.

ARAGORN'S HAND moves to his sword hilt.

(CONTINUED)

82.

BOROMIR

(lightly)

As you wish. I care not.

CUT TO:

SARUMAN

So, Gandalf...you try to lead them over

Caradhras. And if that fails...where

then will you go? THE FELLOWSHIP

struggles through the snow.

SARUMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

If the mountain defeats you, will you

risk a more dangerous road?

CUT TO:

LEGOLAS

(urgent)

There is a fell voice in the air.

GANDALF

It's Saruman.

(CONTINUED)

83.

ARAGORN

(urgently)

He's trying to bring down the mountain.

Gandalf! We must turn back!

GANDALF

No!

GANDALF

(YELLING)

Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho I

ruith. Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie

still, hold your wrath.

CUT TO:

BOROMIR

(urgent)

We must get off the mountain! Make for

the gap of Rohan and take the West road

to my city.

ARAGORN

The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to

Isengard.

GIMLI

We cannot pass over the mountain. Let us

go under it. Let us go through the mines

of Moria. Gandalf has a concerned look on

his face.

(CONTINUED)

84.

SARUMAN (V.O.)

Moria. You fear to go into those mines,

don't you? The dwarves delved too

greedily and too deep.

SARUMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

You know what they awoke in, the darkness

of Khazad-dum. Shadow and flame.

GANDALF

Let the ringbearer decide.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

Frodo?

FRODO

We will go through the mines. Gandalf

slowly nods.

GANDALF

So be it.

CUT TO:

GIMLI

(in awe)

The walls of Moria!

GANDALF

Itidin...it mirrors only starlight and

moonlight.

(CONTINUED)

85.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

It reads, "The door of Durin, Lord of

Moria. Speak, friend, and enter."

MERRY

What do you suppose that means?

GANDALF

(confident)

It's quite simple. If you are a friend,

speak the password and the doors will

open.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

(incanting)

Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!

LATER:

ARAGORN

(whispering)

Mines are no place for a Pony, even one

so brave as Bill.

SAM

Bye, Bill.

ARAGORN

Go on, Bill, go on..don't worry, Sam...he

knows his way home. Aragorn slaps Bill on

the rump...Bill goes trotting off. CLOSE

ON: Sam watching Bill disappear into the

darkness.

SAM

Goodbye, Bill.

(CONTINUED)

86.

ARAGORN

(ominous)

Do not disturb the water.

FRODO

(quietly)

It's a riddle...

FRODO (CONT'D)

(explaining)

Speak, friend, and enter.   What's the

Elvish for friend?

GANDALF

Oh...mellon.

GIMLI

So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled

hospitality of the dwarves; roaring

fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.

This, my friend, is the home of my

cousin, Balin...and they call this a

Mine...

(snorting)

A mine!

(CONTINUED)

87.

BOROMIR

(grimly)

This is no mine...it's a tomb!

GIMLI

(in horror)

Oh...no...no..no... ! Legolas pulls a

crude arrow out of a skeleton.

LEGOLAS

Goblins!

BOROMIR

We make for the Gap of Rohan.    We should

never have come here.

GANDALF

Into the mines!

BOROMIR

Legolas!

(CONTINUED)

88.

GANDALF

(ominous)

We now have but one choice...we must face

the long dark of Moria. Be on your

guard...there are older and fouler things

than the Orcs in the deep places of the

world.

CUT TO:

GANDALF

Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to

the other side. Let us hope that our

presence will go unnoticed.

CUT TO:

GANDALF

I have no memory of this place.

PIPPIN

Are we lost?

(CONTINUED)

89.

MERRY

No. I don't think we are.   Shhhh,

Gandalf's thinking.

PIPPIN

Merry!

MERRY

What?

PIPPIN

I'm hungry.

FRO DO

(whispers)

There's something down there.

GANDALF

(quietly)

It's Gollum.

FRODO

Gollum!

GANDALF

He's been following us for three days.

FRODO

(disbelieving)

He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?

GANDALF

Escaped...or was set loose. And now the

Ring has drawn him here...he will never

be rid of his need for it. He hates and

loves the ring, as he hates and loves

himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.

Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before

the ring came to him, before it drove him

mad.

(CONTINUED)

90.

FRODO

(grim)

It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he

had the chance.

GANDALF

Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's

hand. Many that live deserve death, and

some that die deserve life. Can you give

it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

Do not be too eager to deal out death in

judgment...even the very wise cannot see

all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum

has some part to play yet, for good or

ill, before this is over. The pity of

Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

FRODO

I wish the ring had never come to me...I

wish none of this had happened.

GANDALF

So do all who live to see such times, but

that is not for them to decide. All we

have to decide is what to do with the

time that is given to us. There is a note

of finality in Gandalf's voice.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

There are other forces at work in this

world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In

which case, you also were meant to have

it...and that is an encouraging thought,

(sudden brightness)

Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points

at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship

scramble to their feet.

MERRY

(relieved)

He's remembered!

GANDALF

No, but the air doesn't smell so foul

down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,

always follow your nose!

(laughs)

Ye s...

91.

GALADRIEL

Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf

taps his staff...for a brief moment a

light

GANDALF

Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city

of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief

sight of a vast roof, far above

SAM

Well, there's an eye opener and no

mistake!

GANDALF

Gimli!!

CUT TO:

GIMLI

No...no...oh, no!

(CONTINUED)

92.

GANDALF

"Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of

Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had

feared.

LEGOLAS

(urgent whisper to Argorn)

We must move on, we cannot linger.

GANDALF

(reading)

"They have taken the Bridge and the

second hall: we have barred the

gates...but cannot hold them for

long...the ground shakes...drums in the

deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves

in the dark. Will no- one save us? They

are coming."

GANDALF

(angry)

Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next

time and rid us of your stupidity!

SAM

(worried)

Mr. Frodo!

(CONTINUED)

93.

LEGOLAS

Orcs !

ARAGORN

(to the hobbits)

Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.

BOROMIR

They have a cave troll!

GIMLI

(yelling)

Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in

Moria who still draws breath!

SAM

I think I'm getting the hang of this.

FRODO

Aragorn!   Aragorn!

(CONTINUED)

94.

ARAGORN

(shocked yell)

Frodo!!

SAM

He's alive!

FRODO

I'm alright. I'm not hurt.

ARAGORN

You should be dead. That spear would've

skewered a wild boar!

GANDALF

I think there's more to this hobbit than

meets the eye.

GIMLI

Mithril! You are full of surprises,

Master Baggins.

GANDALF

To the bridge of Khazad-dum!

CUT TO:

GANDALF

This way!

(CONTINUED)

95.

BOROMIR

What is this new devilry?

GANDALF

(quietly)

A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world!

This foe is beyond any of you!

(urgent yell)

Run! Quickly!

CUT TO:

GANDALF

Lead them on, Aragorn.   The bridge is

near.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

Do as I say; swords are no more use here.

GIMLI

Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes

through the wall and spreads its vast

wings.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

96.

GIMLI (CONT'D)

It swoops down past the Fellowship,

disappearing into a flaming pit!

CUT TO:

GANDALF

(yelling)

Over the bridge! Fly!

GANDALF (CONT'D)

You cannot pass!

FRODO

(alarmed yell)

Gandalf!

GANDALF

(yelling)

I am a servant of the Secret Fire,

wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark

fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.

GANDALF (CONT'D)

Go back to the shadow! The BALROG slashes

at Gandalf with its Sword of

GANDALF (CONT'D)

You shall not pass!! The Balrog places

one foot onto the bridge. Aragorn and

Boromir race forward, swords drawn.

(screaming)

Gandalf!

GANDALF

(fierce)

Fly, you fools!

FRODO

No!

ARAGORN

Gandalf!

CUT TO:

ARAGORN

(urgent)

Legolas, get them up!

BOROMIR

Give them a moment...for pity's sake!

ARAGORN

By nightfall these hills will be swarming

with Orcs! We must reach the woods of

Lothlorien. Come, Boromir, Legolas,

Gimli, get them up. On your feet, Sam.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

98.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

Boromir glances towards Frodo, then back

at Aragorn. Frodo is walking away, as if

in a daze.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

Frodo?   Frodo!

CUT TO:

GIMLI

Stay close, young hobbits..they say a

Sorceress lives in these woods. An elf-

witch of terrible power. All who look

upon her fall under her spell...

GALADRIEL (V.O.)

Frodo...

GIMLI

And are never seen again!

GALADRIEL (V.O.)

...your coming to us is as the footsteps

of doom. You bring great evil here,

Ringbearer.

SAM

Mr. Frodo?

GIMLI

Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare

so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and

the ears of a fox!

(CONTINUED)

99.

HALDIR

The dwarf breathes so loud we could have

shot him in the dark.

ARAGORN

(Elvish: with subtitles)

Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your

help. We need your protection.

GIMLI

Aragorn! These woods are perilous. We

should go back.

HALDIR

You have entered the realm of the Lady of

the Wood. You cannot go back.

HALDIR (CONT'D)

Come, she is waiting.

CELEBORN

Eight there are, yet nine there were set

out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is

Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with

him.

GALADRIEL (V.O.)

(softly aloud)

...he has fallen into shadow. Galadriel

looks to Aragorn.

GALADRIEL (CONT'D)

The Quest stands upon the edge of a

knife. Stray but a little and it will

fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope

remains while the company is true.

GALADRIEL (CONT'D)

Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go

now and rest for you are weary with

sorrow and much toil. Galadriel's eyes

turn to Frodo...her voice fades.

GALADRIEL (CONT'D)

Tonight you will sleep in peace.

Welcome, Frodo of the Shire... CLOSE ON:

FRODO looks at GALADRIEL. SUDDEN INSERT:

LEGOLAS

(sadly)

A lament for Gandalf...

MERRY

What do they say about him?

LEGOLAS

I have not the heart to tell you. For me,

the grief is still too near. Boromir is

sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him.

ARAGORN

Take some rest..these borders are well

protected.

BOROMIR

I will find no rest here. I heard her

voice inside my head...she spoke of my

father and the fall of Gondor, and she

said to me: "Even now, there

BOROMIR (CONT'D)

is hope left. But I cannot see it...it

is long since we had any hope.

BOROMIR (CONT'D)

My father is a noble man, but his rule is

failing and our..our people lose faith.

He looks to me to make things right...and

I would do it, I would see the glory of

Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it,

Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion,

glimmering like a spike of pearl and

silver, its banners caught high in the

morning breeze...have you ever been

called home by the clear ringing of

silver trumpets?

ARAGORN

I have seen the white city..long ago.

One day our paths will lead us there, and

the tower guards shall take up the call

"the Lords of Gondor have returned."

GALADRIEL

Will you look into the mirror? Frodo

looks with apprehension at the silver

basin.

FRODO

(warily)

What will I see?

GALADRIEL

Even the wisest cannot tell for the

mirror shows many things...things that

were ..things that are...and some things

that have not yet come to pass.

103.

FRODO

(joyous)

Gandalf!

GALADRIEL

I know what it is you saw...for it is

also in my mind. It is the future,

Frodo. It is what will come to pass if

you should fail.

GALADRIEL (CONT'D)

The fellowship is breaking. It has

already begun. He will try to take the

ring. You know of whom I speak. One by

one, it will destroy them all.

FRODO (V.O.)

If you ask it of me, I will give you the

One Ring.

(CONTINUED)

104.

GALADRIEL

You offer it to me freely...I do not deny

that my heart has greatly desired this.

GALADRIEL (CONT'D)

In place of the Dark Lord, you would have

a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and

terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous as the

Sea! Stronger than the foundations of

the earth...all shall love me and

despair! Frodo takes a step away from

Galadriel...

GALADRIEL (CONT'D)

(gently)

I pass the test.

(laughs)

I will diminish and go into the west and

remain Galadriel. Frodo's confidence

drains away.

FRODO

I cannot do this alone...

GALADRIEL

You are the ring-bearer, Frodo...to bear

a ring of power is to be alone. This task

was appointed to you, and if you do not

find a way, no one will.

FRODO

Then I know what I must do. It's

just...I'm afraid to do it. Galadriel

kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at

him intently.

GALADRIEL

Even the smallest person can change the

course of the future.

SARUMAN (V.O.)

They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark

Powers ... tortured and mutilated...a

ruined and terrible form of life. And

now...perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai.

Whom do you serve?

LURTZ

(gutteral rasp)

Saruman.

SARUMAN

Hunt them down. Do not stop until they

are found. You do not know pain. You do

not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.

Saruman turns to Lurtz.

SARUMAN (CONT'D)

(coldly)

One of the Halflings carries something of

great value...bring him to me...alive and

unspoiled...kill the others.

Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the

light of Earendil, our most beloved star.

ARAGORN

We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the

boats and continue on foot..we approach

Mordor from the North.

GIMLI

(gloomy)

Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding

our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable

labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And

after that gets even better...a

festering, stinking marshland, far as the

eye can see.

ARAGORN

That is our Road...I suggest you take

some rest and recover your strength,

Master Dwarf.

GIMLI

(indignant)

Recover my...

LEGOLAS

We should leave now.

ARAGORN

No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We

must wait for cover of darkness.

LEGOLAS

It is not the Eastern shore that worries

me.

LEGOLAS (CONT'D)

A shadow and a threat has been growing in

my mind. Something draws near, I can

feel it.

(CONTINUED)

108.

MERRY

Where's Frodo?

BOROMIR

(quietly)

None of us should wander alone; you least

of all. So much depends on you...Frodo?

BOROMIR (CONT'D)

I know why you seek solitude. You

suffer, I see it day by day. Are you

sure you do not suffer needlessly?

BOROMIR (CONT'D)

Let me help you. There are other ways,

Frodo..other paths that we might take.

FRODO

I know what you would say, and it would

seem like wisdom but for the warning of

my heart.

BOROMIR

Warning?   Against what?

(CONTINUED)

109.

BOROMIR (CONT'D)

We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that

fear drive us to destroy what hope we

have...don't you see that is madness?

FRODO

There is no other way.

BOROMIR

I ask only for the strength to defend my

people.

(angrily drops the wood he has

collected)

If you would but lend me the ring...

FRODO

No. . .

BOROMIR

Why do you recoil?   I am no thief.

FRODO

(wary)

You are not yourself.

BOROMIR

What chance do you think you have? They

will find you, they will take the ring

and you will beg for death before the

end.

BOROMIR (CONT'D)

You fool! It is not yours save by

unhappy chance...it might have been mine.

It should be mine. Give it to me! Give

me the ring.

FRODO DISAPPEARS

Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into

thin air!

BOROMIR

I see your mind...you will take the ring

to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to

your death and the death of us all.

Stay away!

Frodo...I swore to protect you.

FRODO

Can you protect me from yourself?

FRODO (CONT'D)

Would you destroy it?

ARAGORN

I would have gone with you to the end...

into the very fires of Mordor.

ARAGORN

I let Frodo go.

BOROMIR

Then you did what I could not.   I tried

to take the ring from him.

ARAGORN

The ring is beyond our reach now.

BOROMIR

Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed

you all.

ARAGORN

No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You

have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to

bind Boromir's wound.

BOROMIR

Leave it! It is over...the world of Men

will fall and all will come to darkness

and my city to ruin..Aragorn..

ARAGORN

I do not know what strength is in my

blood, but I swear to you... I will not

let the White City fall, nor your people

fail...

Our people...our people...

LEGOLAS (CONT'D)

You mean not to follow them...

ARAGORN

Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

GIMLI

Then it has all been in vain...the

fellowship has failed.

ARAGORN

Not if we hold true to each other. We

will not abandon Merry and Pippin to

torment and death, not while we have

strength left.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

Leave all that can be spared behind...

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN..a steely light in his

eye.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

(grimly)

We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.

GIMLI

Yes!   Ha!

(CONTINUED)

118.

FRODO

Mordor!   I hope the others find a safer

road.

SAM

(simply)

Strider'll look after them.

FRODO

I don't suppose we'll ever see them

again.

SAM

We may yet, Mr. Frodo.   We may.

FRODO

Sam?

FRODO (CONT'D)

I'm glad you're with me.
