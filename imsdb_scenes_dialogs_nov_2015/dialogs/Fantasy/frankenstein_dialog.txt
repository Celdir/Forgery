From the novel by

Mary W. Shelley

2ND REVISED DRAFT

February 8, 1993

WALTON

PULL, YOU BASTARDS! PULL!

WALTON

Cut the damn rigging free before we

lose the mast!

LOOKOUT (O.S.)

IIIICEBEEEEERG!

WALTON

HARD TO PORT!

GRIGORI

It's going to ram us.

WALTON

It wouldn't dare.

SMASH CUT TO:

WALTON

Put your backs into it!

SAILOR #1

What's the use? This godless ice

stretches for miles! Would you have

us chow our way back to England?

WALTON

No. But we'll chop our way to the

North Pole if we have to. Inch by

bloody inch.

GRIGORI

You can't mean to go on! Our journey

is ended! The best we can hope for

now is to get out of this alive!

SAILOR #2

Aye, if the ice ever lets us!

WALTON

The ice will break. And when it does,

we proceed north... as planned.

GRIGORI

At the cost of how many more lives?

GRIGORI

There's something out there.

WALTON

You five come with me! The rest stay

with the ship!

GRIGORI

Look.

WALTON

Back to the ship.

OLD SAILOR

Only the ice to starboard, boy.

YOUNG SAILOR

Is it breaking up?

OLD SAILOR

Just dancing on the current. It'll

freeze even tighter come next wind.

SAILOR #4

It was a polar bear. That's what I

say.

SAILOR #5

Say all you want, but you weren't

there. It left human tracks.

SAILOR #6

No man could tear those dogs apart.

SAILOR #5

No human. We've roused a demon from

the ice.

SAILOR

Something. In the mist.

YOUNG SAILOR

It's the demon! Shoot while you've a

chance!

WALTON

Dead?

GRIGORI

Captain, I implore you. The men are

frightened and angry. They want your

assurance.

WALTON

They knew the risks when they signed

on. I've come too far to turn back

now.

GRIGORI

Then you run the danger of pushing

them to mutiny.

WALTON

(low, tight)

Let them try.

WALTON

You're awake. I've prepared some

broth. It'll help restore you.

VICTOR

(hoarse, faltering)

I'm... dying.

VICTOR

Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple

diagnosis.

WALTON

Are you a physician?

VICTOR

(faint smile)

How is it you come to be here?

WALTON

There's a startling question, coming

from you.

(beat)

I'm captain of this ship. We sailed

from Archangel a month ago, seeking

a passage to the North Pole.

VICTOR

Ah. An explorer.

WALTON

Would-be. I'm plagued with my share

of difficulties just at the moment.

VICTOR

I heard.

WALTON

I can't say I blame them. We're

trapped in this ice and bedeviled by

some sort of... creature.

VICTOR

Creature? A... human like creature?

WALTON

(stunned)

You know of it?

VICTOR

Your men are right to be afraid.

WALTON

Then explain it, whatever it is. It

could save the voyage. I've spent

years planning this. My entire

fortune.

VICTOR

You'd persist at the cost of your

own life? The lives of your crew?

WALTON

Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge

we gain, the achievements we leave

behind... those live on.

VICTOR

Do you share my madness?

WALTON

Madness?

VICTOR

We are kindred, you and I. Men of

ambition. Let me tell you all that I

have lost in such pursuits. I pray

my story will come to mean for you

all that is capricious and evil in

man.

WALTON

(angry, frightened)

Who are you?

VICTOR

(beat)

My name is Frankenstein...

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Failure has no pride, Victor. You

must try again.

LITTLE BOY (O.S.)

Yes, Ma'am.

FATHER

Mrs. Moritz, would you and your

daughter excuse us?

MRS. MORITZ

Of course, Doctor. Madam. Come along,

Justine. Bring your dolly.

MOTHER

Victor. This is Elizabeth. She's

coming to live with us.

FATHER

She has lost her parents to scarlet

fever. She is an orphan.

MOTHER

You must think of her as your own

sister. You must look after her. And

be kind to her.

ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)

I loved her from the moment that I

first saw her.

MOTHER

Victor. Elizabeth is frightened by

the storm. Go comfort her.

VICTOR

Don't cry, Elizabeth.

ELIZABETH

(frightened)

Aren't you?

VICTOR

We'll build a fort. So the lightning

can't get us.

ELIZABETH

Are you sure it can't hurt us?

VICTOR

Nothing can. Not ever.

MRS. MORITZ

You must lead, Victor. The lady will

always look to you for guidance, so

your steps must be sure and strong...

VICTOR

Mrs. Moritz.

MRS. MORITZ

...aaand, one-two-three, one-two-

three, twirl-two-three...

JUSTINE

Mama, can I dance with Victor?

MRS. MORITZ

Nonsense, Justine. Hush. And now a

sweeping arc about the room! one-

two-three, twirl-two-three.

MRS. MORITZ

...one-two-three, twirl-two-three...

Excellent! You'll be the envy of all

the young ladies and gentlemen!

MRS. MORITZ

Justine. Surely you can maintain

better time than that.

JUSTINE

Yes, Mama.

ELIZABETH

She'll be all right.

MRS. MORITZ

You can do nothing here. Wait

downstairs.

VICTOR

Mother?

FATHER

Victor, do as you're told!

VICTOR

As a boy, I stood at this window and

watched God destroy our tree.

VICTOR

Father?

ELIZABETH

Oh God. The blood.

FATHER

I did everything I could.

VICTOR

How could all my father's knowledge

and skill fail to save her?

ELIZABETH

It's not ours to decide. All that

live must die. It's God's will.

VICTOR

What kind of God is He to will this?

ELIZABETH

She was mother to me as well. But

ours is the job of the living. It's

up to us now to hold this family

together. We must think of Father

and be strong for him.

(beat)

I cannot do that alone.

VICTOR

God took her from us.

ELIZABETH

He left a beautiful gift in her place.

A baby boy. To cherish and love as

our very own. Your brother

VICTOR

Our brother.

JUSTINE

Poor William! What indignant tears!

ELIZABETH

There, there... shhh...

ELIZABETH

Victor, have a care! You'll make him

dizzy!

VICTOR

The world is a dizzying place.

ELIZABETH

Oh, do give him here! He needs to be

comforted and held!

VICTOR

He needs to vent his outrage to the

skies! Make yourself heard, Willie!

Learning to walk is not an easy thing!

Why should it be so?

ELIZABETH

That's the nature of all progress,

William. Don't let your brother sway

you otherwise.

JUSTINE

Quite right!

VICTOR

Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a

feast to be consumed. Women would

have you believe you must walk before

you can run. Or run before you can

waltz!

ELIZABETH

(laughing)

Give me that child before you fill

his head with drivel!

VICTOR

Devil take walking, ladies! My brother

shall learn to waltz!

JUSTINE

Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!

ELIZABETH

Scandalous! What would your dear

mother say?

JUSTINE

(thinks a beat)

One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl-

two-three...

WILLIE

Auntie Justine, Papa said I could

have a sweet.

JUSTINE

You can. But not before dinner.

JUSTINE

You dance so beautifully together.

ELIZABETH

And you look so lovely.

JUSTINE

Victor? Spare me one dance?

ELIZABETH

Go on, ask her. Please. I'm quite

out of breath.

FATHER

My friends, fatherly pride won't

allow this occasion to pass without

my raising a toast.

FATHER

To Victor. My son. Who read every

medical book in my library by age

thirteen... and then re-read them,

which seemed excessive even to me.

(the guests ROAR with

laughter)

Drape yourself in glory, my boy.

Study well.  When you return, you

return a man of medicine. I will

then be honored to call you

"colleague."

VICTOR

But never your equal.

FATHER

No. You'll surpass me.

ELIZABETH

Smell the air. Wonderful.

VICTOR

Quite a send-off, isn't it?

ELIZABETH

Father's so proud.

VICTOR

And you?

ELIZABETH

Prouder still. You'll be the

handsomest student there.

VICTOR

I'll have to do better than that.

ELIZABETH

You will.

(searches his eyes)

What do you want, Victor?

VICTOR

To be the best there ever was. To

push our knowledge beyond our

dreams... to eradicate disease and

pestilence... to purge mankind of

ignorance and fear...

VICTOR

I'm not mad.

ELIZABETH

No. Just very earnest. And very dear.

VICTOR

I've loved you all my life

ELIZABETH

All my life I've known.

VICTOR

This feels... incestuous.

ELIZABETH

Is that what makes it so delicious?

ELIZABETH

Brother and sister still?

VICTOR

I wish to be your husband.

ELIZABETH

I wish to be your wife.

VICTOR

Then come with me to Ingolstadt.

Marry me now.

ELIZABETH

If only I could. But one of us must

stay. Father's not strong. Willie's

just a child. Who can look after

them in your absence? Who can run

the estate?

VICTOR

Only you.

ELIZABETH

I will be here when you return.

ELIZABETH

My head is spinning. I want to give

myself to you.

ELIZABETH

If we're to be married, must we wait?

VICTOR

You make me weak.

ELIZABETH

Not as weak as I.

ELIZABETH

Our decision. Together.

VICTOR

Your decision. For us.

ELIZABETH

(hesitates)

I give you my soul...

VICTOR

(nods)

...until our wedding night. When our

bodies will join.

ELIZABETH

Victor. I love you,

VICTOR

Elizabeth. My more than sister.

VICTOR

I'll make you so proud, Mother.

FATHER

Write to us often.

VICTOR

We never finished our dance.

(she smiles)

Someday we shall.

VICTOR

The others will look to you while

I'm gone, Willie. Be strong.

VICTOR

Elizabeth.

DISSOLVE TO:

FRAU BRACH

No real rooms left. All we've got is

attic space. No one ever wants the

attic space...

VICTOR

This will do nicely.

KREMPE

In science, the letter of fact is

the letter of law. Our pursuit is as

dogmatic as any religious precept.

Think of yourselves as disciples of

a strict and hallowed sect. Someday

you may be priests... but only if

you learn the scripture chapter and

verse.

(off their laughter)

Any questions?

VICTOR

(hand shoots up)

But surely, Professor, you don't

intend we disregard the more...

philosophical works.

KREMPE

Philosophical?

VICTOR

Those which stir the imagination as

well as the intellect. Paracelsus,

for one.

KREMPE

Paracelsus?

VICTOR

Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius

Agrippa...

KREMPE

What is your name?

VICTOR

Victor Frankenstein, sir.

(no response)

Of geneva.

KREMPE

Of Geneva.

(beat)

Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva.

Do you wish to study medicine? Or

mysticism?

KREMPE

Those of you unfamiliar with Mr.

Frankenstein's suggested reading

list... thankfully, that would be

most of you... would be well advised

to avoid it. Here at Ingolstadt, we

concern ourselves with immutable

reality...

(specific to Victor)

...not the ravings of lunatics and

alchemists hundreds of years in their

graves. Understood?

KREMPE

I am relieved. Are there any relevant

questions?

(there are none)

Lecture hall dismissed.

HENRY

I was just clearing my throat.

VICTOR

Very well then.

HENRY

You know, you're quite mad.

VICTOR

(low, measured)

I am not mad.

HENRY

(matching Victor's

tone)

As a march hare.

VICTOR

Are you having me on?

HENRY

Of course I am. It pays to humor the

insane.

HENRY

Henry Clerval.

VICTOR

Victor, Victor Frankenstein.

HENRY

I know. You have a way of making an

impression.

VICTOR

Do you really think I'm mad?

HENRY

Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing

you know, you'll be teaching

toadstools to speak.

SCHILLER

If it isn't the sorcerer. Found

yourself an apprentice?

VICTOR

I'm afraid I rejected his application.

He merely dabbles.

HENRY

Dilettantes need not apply. What

about you? Schiller, isn't it?

SCHILLER

Von Schiller. I'm interested in real

medicine. Treating the sick.

HENRY

Really? I myself find sick people

rather revolting.

(off their looks)

I'm here to secure my degree with a

minimum of fuss and hard work that I

might settle into a life of privilege

treating rich old ladies with gout

and dallying with their daughters.

SCHILLER

You two disgust me.

VICTOR

Rich old ladies and their daughters?

HENRY

Can you think of a better reason?

VICTOR

Quite a few.

HENRY

Do me a favor then...

(claps his shoulder)

...keep them to yourself.

CLAUDE

It's turning out to be a good year.

ELIZABETH

Let's return a tenth of the crop to

the tenants.

(off his look)

They had a hard winter.

CLAUDE

Not even your father would be that

generous.

ELIZABETH

Then there's no need to tell him, is

there?

STABLEBOY

Miss! The mail arrived! There's one

from Master Victor!

ELIZABETH

...and not a day goes by that I do

not cherish your faces in my mind's

eye or ache to see you all again. Be

assured that I am with you in spirit,

and you are never far from my

thoughts. I remain, as always, your

loving and devoted Victor. P.S.

WILLIE

What does it say?

ELIZABETH

It says, give Willie an extra big

hug for me.

WILLIAM

(beaming)

Read it again?

FADE TO:

VICTOR (O.S.)

That's no excuse for being a pompous

ass!

KREMPE

I'll see you thrown out of this

university! I'll go to the dean

himself! Take me at my word,

Frankenstein! The dean himself!

HENRY

The entire school heard it. It wasn't

something one could miss.

VICTOR

You're a comfort to me, Henry.

HENRY

What now? Writing about it in your

journal won't help.

VICTOR

(quietly)

It's a letter to my father.

VICTOR

Professor Waldman.

WALDMAN

(takes a seat)

Victor, explain yourself.

VICTOR

Krempe has a way of provoking my

temper.

WALDMAN

You have a way of provoking his.

(beat)

I've been watching you. You seem

impatient with your studies.

VICTOR

To say the least. I came here to

expand my mind, but honest inquiry

seems strangled at every turn. All

we do is cling to the old knowledge

instead of seeking the new.

WALDMAN

You disdain accepted wisdom?

VICTOR

No, I embrace it... as something to

be used or discarded as we advance

the boundaries of what is known.

HENRY

(mutters to Waldman)

Now you've got him started.

VICTOR

These are exciting times, Henry.

We're entering an era of amazing

breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner.

He wasn't content to bleed people

with leeches, he pioneered a new

frontier of thought

HENRY

...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox

has been virtually eliminated. I've

heard this speech before.

VICTOR

But you haven't listened, Never in

history has so much seemed possible.

We're on the verge of answers undreamt

of... but only if we have the courage

to ask the questions.

WALDMAN

I understand your frustration. I was

young once myself.

(beat)

Walk me home. Something I'd like to

show you.

WALDMAN

You know for thousands of years the

Chinese have based their medical

science on the belief that the human

body is a chemical engine run by

electricity? They say we all contain

streams of energy which flow through

us like currents in the ocean, or

rivers in the earth.

WALDMAN

Their doctors treat patients by

inserting needles like these into

the flesh at various key points to

manipulate these electric streams.

VICTOR

Preposterous.

WALDMAN

I once saw it done, as a boy in

Canton. My parents were missionaries.

The cure was nothing short of

miraculous.

(off their looks)

I've never forgotten it. Been

fascinated ever since.

HENRY

It smacks of magic.

WALDMAN

Magic. Seems alive, doesn't it?

WALDMAN

Electricity.

VICTOR

It's utterly fantastic! This is the

sort of thing I'm talking about! We

should be learning this!

WALDMAN

Why? God alone knows what it means.

Until it has proven value, it's

nothing more than a ghoulish parlor

trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.

VICTOR

But the possibilities. Combining

ancient knowledge with new? Something

like this could change our fundamental

views!

WALDMAN

It is a thrilling direction to

explore. Thrilling and dangerous.

(off his look)

Nature can be wonderful and terrible.

Science is not a realm for the

reckless; it needs a conscience. We

must proceed cautiously. Assess as

we go.

(drapes the toad)

What I do on my own time is my own

business. The same holds true for

you. You wish to expand your mind?

Fine, do so. You can even join me

here, if you like. But not at the

expense of your normal studies.

VICTOR

I doubt that decision is still mine

to make.

WALDMAN

(waves)

Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an

apology to Professor Krempe...

WALDMAN

"...a sincere and heartfelt apology

which you will then read aloud to

him before the assembled student

body and faculty.

VICTOR

Why?

WALDMAN

(draws close)

Our profession needs talent like

yours. Destroy your career over an

issue of pride? What a waste.

WALDMAN

Go home, Victor. Write the letter,

VICTOR

...and I further wish to extend my

sincerest regrets to Professor Krempe

for my display. My behavior toward

him was both rash and inexcusable.

ELIZABETH (O.S.)

(laughing)

I knew held get himself in trouble.

JUSTINE

Must've been a terrible row.

ELIZABETH

He was almost expelled for calling

one of his professors a "pompous...

(glances to Willie)

Fellow..."

FATHER

He always was opinionated.

ELIZABETH

(reads on, laughs)

He set things right with a proper

apology... and now they've put him

in charge of dissection lab!

WILLIE

What's that?

FATHER

That's where they cut things open

and peer about inside.

WILLIE

Things? What sort of things?

ELIZABETH

It's far too ghoulish for your young

ears.

ELIZABETH

The point is, your brother is a

brilliant student well on his way to

becoming the finest-and most

compassionate doctor ever...

WALDMAN

Re-configure the leads?

VICTOR

Numbers four and twelve directly

into the nervous system?

WALDMAN

Worth a try.

VICTOR

...and the medulla oblongata is the

transition between the spinal cord

and the two parts I've already

named... cerebrum and cerebellum.

Any freshmen feeling queasy yet?

(glances around, smiles)

All of you, from the look of it.

We'll resume your torture tomorrow.

KREMPE

You seem to be adapting well to the

approved curriculum.

VICTOR

Despite the lack of challenge.

WALDMAN

Victor. He was trying to be gracious.

VICTOR

The strain was evident.

HENRY

Come now, you must take some

satisfaction. You've risen to the

top of your class. A position of

prominence and regard.

VICTOR

What keeps me going are my friends.

HENRY

Leave off!

HENRY

Your Elizabeth must be quite a

treasure, Victor

(pointedly to jeweler)

...to justify these prices.

HENRY

(deadpan)

Shouldn't the nose be above the mouth?

WALDMAN

I'm quite serious. Look at all the

charity and clinic work we do. Up

until thirty years ago, the concept

of vaccine was unheard of.

HENRY

You're saying all disease will

eventually be eradicated?

WALDMAN

I'm convinced. Not by treating

symptoms, but by diving nature's

most jealously-guarded secrets.

HENRY

(turning serious)

Do you foresee this happening in our

lifetimes?

WALDMAN

No. But someday.

HENRY

Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.

VICTOR

Only you would think of that!

HENRY

(laughing)

Somebody has to!

VICTOR

I tell you what we need, my friends.

Forget the symptoms and diseases.

What we need is a vaccine for death

itself.

WALDMAN

(laughter)

Oh, now you have gone too far. There's

only one God, Victor.

HENRY

(raises his glass)

And here's to Him. Everything in

moderation, Frankenstein.

VICTOR

(grins)

Nothing in moderation, Clerval.

MAN

Yer not stickin' it in me! Got pox

in it, I hear tell!

FAT WOMAN

Pox? They givin' us pox?

WALDMAN

No, it's not pox, it's a vaccine...

FAT WOMAN

Vaca-what?

WALDMAN

...vaccine, from the Latin vacca,

meaning cow

(glances at her girth)

...or vaccinia, meaning cowpox...

MAN

I told you there was pox in it!

WALDMAN

...no, no, cowpox in a minute

quantity, perfectly harmless, gives

you a natural immunity to small ox,

which is the point of this whole

bloody exercise...

MAN

You doctors kill people! I don' care

what you say, you ain't stickin' it

in me!

WALDMAN

I most assuredly am! It prevents

disease and it's the law! Why am I

explaining myself? Somebody restrain

this damn fool!

HENRY

Professor?

WALDMAN

(softly)

Oh God.

HENRY

They just caught the man who did it.

VICTOR

He was a frightened soul who acted

out of fear and ignorance.

HENRY

They'll hang him all the same.

VICTOR

Good. I'll be there to hear his

worthless neck snap.

HENRY

Keep your voice down. You don't know

what you're saying.

VICTOR

It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't

have happened! The bastard deserves

to die.

HENRY

You're making a scene!

VICTOR

Why Waldman? He of all people should

have cheated death!

HENRY

You can't. Death is God's will!

VICTOR

I resent God's monopoly.

HENRY

That's blasphemy!

VICTOR

Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent

his life trying to help people!

HENRY

All the more reason for us to continue

his work with the poor!

VICTOR

(beat, low)

No. He had more important work.

HENRY

There are sick people who need our

help. Here and now. Not in some future

time. Consider that.

VICTOR

Life and death.

(beat)

Why should You alone have the final

say?

DISSOLVE TO:

VICTOR

To understand the causes of life, we

must first have recourse to death...

and examine the process in minutest

detail...

MAGISTRATE

...his body to be left on public

display for a twenty-four hour period,

thereafter to be consigned to an

unmarked pauper's grave. So the court

has spoken.

VICTOR

No longer pathetic and useless

HENRY

Victor. This has got to stop.

(Victor glances up)

Nobody's seen you in months. You

haven't attended a single class.

VICTOR

I've been preoccupied.

HENRY

We all know how hard you took

Waldman's death. Even Krempe is

sympathetic. But it is time to move

on. It is time to concern yourself

with life.

VICTOR

That is my concern.

(faint smile)

I'm involved in something just now.

I want to finish it in Waldman's

memory.

HENRY

How much longer?

VICTOR

Few months perhaps. I'm gathering

the raw materials even now.

VICTOR

Materials. That's all they are Tissue

to be re-used.

ELIZABETH

Nothing. Still nothing.

JUSTINE

It's been months. It's not like him.

ELIZABETH

Something's wrong. I know it.

(off her look)

I've heard rumors of cholera spreading

south from Hamburg.

JUSTINE

So have I

ELIZABETH

I should go. I should leave today.

JUSTINE

Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into

Germany would be banned. You'd never

get near Ingolstadt.

(beat)

Besides, they're only rumors.

ELIZABETH

(beat, nods)

And not a word of them to Father.

He's agitated enough not hearing

from Victor.

JUSTINE

Read him one of the old letters and

rephrase it. We'll say it came today.

It'll set his mind at ease.

VICTOR

That one.

MAN

With this cholera come to town, we'll

have plenty more for you.

VICTOR

Not optimal. Must use. No time to

replace. Body can't wait.

ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)

I stitched it together with my own

hands...

ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)

A patchwork man of my own devising.

ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)

It took nutrients like a child

receiving milk... blushed like a

young girl with the blood I forced

through its veins...

ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)

...all in preparation.

HENRY

God's sake, what is that stench?

VICTOR

This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy

just now. What do you want?

HENRY

Things have gone worse with this

cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases

a day now. Classes have been

suspended. University's shut down.

VICTOR

Yes? And?

HENRY

Listen to what I'm saying. The

militia's arriving to quarantine the

city. Most of us are getting out

while we still can.

VICTOR

You'll be leaving then.

(beat)

Just as well. You never were cut out

for this, Henry. Goodbye.

HENRY

VICTOR! OPEN THE DOOR! LISTEN TO

REASON!

VOICE (O.S.)

OUT OF THE WAY!

HENRY

Schiller? You're leaving? Where's

all that high talk about treating

the sick?

SCHILLER

(icy)

To hell with them. And you.

FADE TO:

VICTOR

Time running out. Rate of decay

accelerating. Must strike now... or

start again from scratch.

VICTOR

(muffled through the

glass)

Live, you bastard!

VICTOR

It's alive. It's alive.

VICTOR

What have I done?

VICTOR

LET GO OF ME!

VICTOR

Massive birth defects. Result is

malfunctional and vile.

(beat)

Have chosen to abort.

FADE TO:

VICTOR

Stay away!

FADE TO:

VOICE (O.S.)

Bring out your deeeaaad! Bring out

your deeeaaad!

WOMAN (O.S.)

Here! What do you think you're doing?

ROUGH MAN

Stupid bastard!

VENDOR'S WIFE

BURN HIM! BURN HIM!

DISSOLVE TO:

WORKER #1

Over here!

WORKER #2

Oh my God.

HENRY

Victor!

KREMPE

Don't dawdle, lad! The sick cart!

Lift on three! One, two, three!

VICTOR

(delirious, struggling)

No... no... I'm not dead... please...

Don't put me on the cart! I'm not

dead! I'm not dead! I'M NOT DEAD!

WIPE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

FELIX (O.S.)

Yes, yes, I'm coming...

MARIE

Bring Grandfather to the table.

DISSOLVE TO:

HENRY

Thank God your fever broke.

(offers him water)

Slowly, now. Just a sip.

(Victor sips, falls

back)

I've been worried we might lose you.

It's been touch-and-go for a week.

VICTOR

A... week?

HENRY

We feared cholera. Turned out to be

pneumonia, brought on by nervous

exhaustion and some idiot running

around in a storm.

VICTOR

Is that your diagnosis?

HENRY

Mine and Professor Krempe's.

(off his look)

We've been trading off nursing you

in shifts. The rest of the time we're

out working with the cholera victims.

It's his turn for that just now.

VICTOR

You've been going round-the-clock?

HENRY

We catch a few hours sleep where we

can. Usually here at your bedside.

VICTOR

(deeply moved)

Everything in moderation, Clerval.

HENRY

Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.

HENRY

It's the down-and-outs I pity most.

Those who can't fend for themselves.

They'll be dead by the thousands

before this is done. They don't stand

a chance out there.

VICTOR

(thinking of his

creation)

No. They don't.

HENRY

Victor. This place looked like a

charnel house. What went on here?

VICTOR

I want to go home.

HENRY

It'll be months before you're well

enough. Meantime, your family must

be frantic not hearing from you.

HENRY

I found these. Some of the postmarks

go back nine months.

(slaps them on the

bed)

Why don't you open them? And when

you've the strength, have the decency

to ease their minds with a reply.

Soon as the city ends quarantine,

I'll even mail it for you. Along

with this.

(raises the locket)

It's a beautiful gift. Does her no

good lying here.

VICTOR

It can't survive.

FELIX

Not much to look at. Even less to

eat. I don't how we're going to get

through the winter with this yield.

MARIE

We'll sell another pig at market.

FELIX

One less for us.

MARIE

We'll make do. We always have.

FELIX

I'll see if I can scratch a few more

out of the ground.

GRANDFATHER

I wish we could thank our benefactor.

FELIX

Nothing in this life comes free of

cost. I'd like to know who and why.

MAGGIE

It's the Good Spirit of the forest.

FELIX

Who's been filling your head?

GRANDFATHER

It does no harm.

FELIX

(peers at him)

Oh, I see.

THOMAS

Is it, Papa? Is it the Good Spirit?

MARIE

Of course it is. Now finish your

food before it gets cold.

GRANDFATHER

Who's there? Felix? Children?

MAGGIE

ff..reh..nn..nd. Friend? Friend.

MARIE

Good! And now the next

CREATURE

(mimicking the effort)

...freh...nnn..nd. Freehhnnnd.

MARIE

Your hands are bleeding again. Come

in. I'll rub liniment.

CREATURE

.brread... motherrr... frriend...

(stops, gazes up)

Treeeeee.

FELIX

What is going on here?

VICTOR

"...but it's been so long since I've

heard from you. Remember the vow we

took the night you left? You must be

honest with me if your feelings have

changed. Answer for the sake of our

friendship, and both our future

happiness."

(pause)

She wrote that four months ago.

HENRY

A woman like that is far too rare to

be taken lightly.

THOMAS

Ch...uur-ch. Church.

CREATURE

Ch...uuu...ch.

MARIE

Good. And the next.

THOMAS

Fl...oww.

CREATURE

Floww...

CREATURE

...wwer. Flower.

THOMAS

...wer. Flower?

MARIE

Very good! Maggie. Try the next.

CREATURE

Garrr...denn. Garden.

THOMAS

Maria! Look! It's snowing!

MARIE

Maggie! Thomas! You'll catch your

death!

GRANDFATHER

Let them play. There's plenty of

wood for the fire.

FELIX

(shoots her a look)

He's right about that.

CREATURE

It's snnowwinng.

MAGGIE

That one! It's the most beautiful

tree I've ever seen!

CREATURE

Most beautiful... tree...

MAGGIE

Merry Christmas!

CREATURE

For the... Goood Spirr-rit... of

the God of Nature did his soul

FADE TO:

GRANDFATHER

Would you like to sit by the fire?

CREATURE

Nice.

GRANDFATHER

The music? Or the fire?

GRANDFATHER

I'm glad you finally came to the

door. A man shouldn't have to scurry

in the shadows.

CREATURE

Better that way... for me.

GRANDFATHER

Why?

CREATURE

I'm... very, very ugly. People are

afraid. Except you.

GRANDFATHER

(smiles)

It can't be as bad as that.

CREATURE

(soft)

Worse.

GRANDFATHER

I can see you with my hands. If you'll

trust me.

GRANDFATHER

You're an outcast.

CREATURE

Yes. I have been seeking my friends.

GRANDFATHER

Friends? Do they live around here?

CREATURE

Yes. Very close

GRANDFATHER

Why do you not go to them?

CREATURE

I have been... afraid. Afraid...

they will hate me... because I am so

very ugly... and they are so very

beautiful

GRANDFATHER

(softly)

People can be kinder than you think.

CREATURE

I am afraid.

GRANDFATHER

Perhaps I can help. Tell me who.

CREATURE

I love them... so very much. I want...

I want... them to be my ff-family. I

II-Ilove them ss-so very mm-mm-

mmuch...

CREATURE

Don't let them hate me!

GRANDFATHER

Leave him alone!

CREATURE

It's me! It's mmmmeeeeee!

CREATURE

...no.

DISSOLVE TO:

CREATURE

Geneva.

DISSOLVE TO:

HENRY

Our carriage is here.

MRS. KREMPE

(watching the gates)

Such a terrible winter. I'll praise

God to see those gates open again.

KREMPE

I'll have all your things sent on.

They should arrive soon after.

(Victor nods)

It's been a rough time, lad. For us

all. But if you'd like to come back

and finish out your final term once

university re-opens...

VICTOR

Thank you, Professor. For everything.

KREMPE

Write and let us know you've arrived

safely.

VICTOR

Take me home, my friend.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIAM

HE'S COMING HOME!

WILLIAM

Elizabeth! Justine!

FATHER

What's all the fuss? Why are you

shouting?

WILLIAM

He's coming home! Tonight!

ELIZABETH

Who? Victor?

WILLIAM

That's what I'm telling you!

ELIZABETH

(swept with relief)

Thank God.

FATHER

Open it.

WILLIAM

It's Victor!

JUSTINE

It's beautiful! May I?

(takes the locket)

He looks so handsome.

FATHER

What does it say?

ELIZABETH

Let this locket be a token of the

vow we took the night I left.

(beat)

He's coming home to marry me.

WILLIAM

Married! The two of you?

FATHER

Brilliant! I knew it! Ever since you

were children!

JUSTINE

(softly)

That's wonderful.

WILLIAM

Elizabeth? Can I take this to show

Peter?

ELIZABETH

Willie, it's not a toy for your

friends.

WILLIAM

I'll take extra special care, I

promise! Pete's never seen what Victor

looks like! He'll admire it

enormously!

ELIZABETH

Don't dawdle. It'll be dark in a few

hours.

FATHER

Join us for champagne! My son is

coming home!

CREATURE

Wait! Don't be afraid!

MRS. MORITZ

Justine! Pay attention!

JUSTINE

(tight)

Yes, Mother.

ELIZABETH

(pulls her aside)

Are you all right?

JUSTINE

(even tighter)

Fine.

JUSTINE

I'll be all right. Really.

FATHER

Have you seen Willie?

ELIZABETH

Is he not back yet?

FATHER

Claude rode over there to see if

held lost track of time. They say he

never arrived.

ELIZABETH

It's far too late for him to still

be out.

CLAUDE

Don't worry, Monsieur, we'll find

him.

ELIZABETH

WILLIE!

JUSTINE

WILLIE!

VICTOR

There! Look!

HENRY

Quite a place.

VICTOR

Thank you, Henry.

HENRY

For what?

VICTOR

This. My home. My family.

(softly)

If not for you, I'd be dead in a

burial pit somewhere.

VICTOR

Elizabeth?

SMASH CUT TO:

MRS. MORITZ

Sir. I'm terrified for my girl.

VICTOR

(softly)

We'll organize another search now

that it's light enough. We'll find

her, Mrs. Moritz, I promise.

ELIZABETH

What is Father's outlook?

HENRY

I am cautiously hopeful. With quiet

and proper care he may eventually

regain some or most of his strength.

ELIZABETH

Thank you, Henry.

POLICEMAN #1

Mr. Frankenstein. We've apprehended

the murderer. Not five miles from

here, hiding in a barn.

VICTOR

Who is it?

POLICEMAN #2

It's very unsettling, sir. And quite

strange. Perhaps you'd better come

with us.

FEMALE VOICE

Victor?

JUSTINE

Victor! It's you! Thank God!

JUSTINE

Is it true? What they say about

Willie? Is it true?

VICTOR

Yes.

JUSTINE

Willie. My poor little angel.

(looks up)

Victor! They think I did it!

VICTOR

Did you?

JUSTINE

(low)

I don't believe... I am in need of

your comfort... anymore.

VICTOR

(a whisper)

Did you, Justine?

JUSTINE

Get out!

KITCHEN MAID

I found her sobbing her eyes out.

Poor thing, I said, what's all this?

And she spilled her heart to me about

Master Victor. How she'd always loved

him, and now he was coming home to

marry mistress Elizabeth.

KITCHEN MAID

She cried and cried about the

beautiful locket he'd sent. How she

wished it was hers. She swore me

never to tell a soul.

(peers at Justine)

That was before the boy went missing,

a'course.

VICTOR

I always viewed her with brotherly

affection. I had no idea of her

feelings for me.

PROSECUTOR

Rejection can be a powerful wound.

People have been known to do uncanny

things.

VICTOR

But to commit so ghastly and terrible

a crime against a child she loved?

VICTOR

It's hard to believe.

ELIZABETH

Justine and I grew up as sisters. I

know her better than anybody.

DEFENDING COUNSEL

Do you think it possible she committed

this crime?

ELIZABETH

William was as much her child as

mine. We were both mother to him.

(beat)

I believe she would sooner have

strangled the life from her own body.

DEFENDING COUNSEL

Then you consider the charge without

merit.

ELIZABETH

I consider the charge imbecilic.

JUSTINE

Yes. I took refuge in the barn.

Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm?

Freezing and wet? I was exhausted

and could search no longer.

PROSECUTOR

And is it true, Miss Moritz, that

you love Victor Frankenstein? That

your heart was broken?

(off her silence)

Answer the question. Do you love

Victor Frankenstein?

JUSTINE

I have always loved him.

PROSECUTOR

Is it also not true that you murdered

his brother William in a misdirected

crime of passion?

JUSTINE

Murder Willie? In my heart, he was

our child. Victor's and mine. Such a

thing could never have entered my

mind.

PROSECUTOR

So you have claimed. Yet you have no

explanation for this.

(holds up the locket)

The locket last seen in the hands of

the poor murdered child was found

hidden in your dress the morning

following the murder. The locket you

so coveted.

(leans close)

How did it come to be in your

possession?

JUSTINE

I have no knowledge of that.

CREATURE

Frankenstein.

VICTOR

Oh God. Oh God! No! NOOOOOOO!

VICTOR

Oh God. Justine. Forgive me.

VICTOR

My mind was not playing tricks. He

was there in the storm... gloating

over his crimes... challenging me to

come.

ELIZABETH

But why risk yourself? Hasn't this

family suffered enough?

VICTOR

I've no choice

ELIZABETH

If what you say is true, it is a

matter for the police!

VICTOR

They've done a fine job. Hanging an

innocent for the crime of a fiend.

ELIZABETH

(softly)

Do you know this man? Is there

something between you?

VICTOR

I know only that he is a killer.

And I shall bring back his carcass.

VICTOR

WHERE ARE YOU?

CREATURE

Come warm yourself if you like.

VICTOR

You speak.

CREATURE

Yes, I speak. And read. And think...

and know the ways of Man.

(pause)

I've been waiting for you. Two months

now.

VICTOR

How did you find me?

CREATURE

The letters in your journal. That

and a geography book.

(picks up a letter)

Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.

VICTOR

Kill me and have done with it.

CREATURE

Kill you? Hardly that.

VICTOR

Then why am I here? What did you

want with me?

CREATURE

More to the point, why am I here?

What did you want with me?

(off Victor's look)

What does one say to one's Maker,

having finally met him face to face?

Milton gave it voice.

(grabs a book, thumbs

to a certain page)

Did I request thee, Maker, from my

clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit

thee from Darkness to promote me?

VICTOR

Fine words from a child killer. You

who murdered my brother.

CREATURE

Your crime... as well as mine.

VICTOR

How dare you. You're disgusting and

evil.

CREATURE

Evil?

(scurries closer)

Do you believe in evil?

VICTOR

I see it before me.

CREATURE

I'm not sure I believe. But then I

had no one to instruct me. I had no

mother... and my father abandoned me

at birth.

CREATURE

Were the dying cries of your brother

music in my ears?

CREATURE

I took him by the throat with one

hand... lifted him off the ground.

And slowly crushed his neck.

(emotion growing)

That poor, innocent child died in my

grip... because all I could see was

your face... and all I could feel

was my rage. And when I let him go,

he fluttered to the grass like a

sparrow...

CREATURE

Later, when they were searching, I

followed the pretty lady who got

lost in the woods...

CREATURE (V.O.)

She was so lovely. I longed to touch

her... and seek her sympathy...

CREATURE (V.O.)

...but I simply returned the object

which had triggered my crime, hoping

in some small way to atone...

CREATURE

You gave me these emotions, but you

didn't tell me how to use them. Now

two people are dead. Because of us.

CREATURE

Why, Victor? Why? What were you

thinking?

VICTOR

There was something at work in my

soul which I do not understand.

CREATURE

What of my soul? Do I have one? Or

was that a part you left out?

(spreads his hands)

Who were these people of which I am

comprised? Good people? Bad people?

VICTOR

Materials. Nothing more.

CREATURE

You're wrong. Do you know I knew how

to play this?

CREATURE

In which part of me did this knowledge

reside? In these hands? In this mind?

In this heart?

(beat)

And reading and speaking. Not things

learned... so much as things

remembered.

VICTOR

Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.

CREATURE

Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy.

They taunt me in my dreams. I've

seen a beautiful woman lying back

and beckoning for me to love her.

Whose woman was this? I've seen boys

playing, splashing about in a stream.

Whose childhood friends were these?

(soft, intense)

Who am I?

VICTOR

(hollow)

I don't know.

CREATURE

Then perhaps I believe in evil after

all.

VICTOR

What can I do?

CREATURE

There is something I want.

(pause)

A friend.

VICTOR

Friend?

CREATURE

A companion. A female. Like me, so

she won't hate me.

VICTOR

Like you? Oh, God, you don't know

what you're asking.

CREATURE

I do know that for the sympathy of

one living being, I would make peace

with all.

(beat)

I have love in me the likes of which

you can scarcely imagine. And rage

the likes of which you would not

believe. If I cannot satisfy the

one, I will demonically indulge the

other. That choice is yours.

(off his look)

You're the one who set this in motion,

Frankenstein.

VICTOR

And if I consent?

CREATURE

We'd travel north, my bride and I.

To the furthest reaches of the Pole,

where no man has ever set foot. There

we would live out our lives.

Together.

(beat)

No human eye would ever see us again.

This I vow.

CREATURE

Soon?

VICTOR

Yes. I want this over and done with.

CREATURE

I'll be waiting. And watching.

ELIZABETH

I thought I'd never see you again!

VICTOR

I'm all right. I'm safe,

HENRY

What happened up there?

VICTOR

I didn't find what I was looking

for.

CLAUDE

What did you find?

CLAUDE

These have been fired.

VICTOR

At shadows. My nerves got the better

of me.

ELIZABETH

What sort of task?

VICTOR

It's not something I can explain

now. Perhaps someday.

ELIZABETH

What of our marriage? Victor, we've

had so much tragedy. I want this

family to live again.

VICTOR

So do I.

ELIZABETH

We need each other now, I need your

comfort and strength, not separation

and solitude.

VICTOR

A month at most, that's all I ask.

(draws close)

Elizabeth, please. Things have not

yet resolved. I must take steps to

see that they do. For our family's

sake. For our sake.

(caresses her face)

You are life itself. We shall seal

our vow. The moment I am done.

VICTOR

You must regain your strength to

preside at our wedding... and spoil

your grandchildren later on. These

are duties you cannot shirk.

VICTOR

We're all safe now. I promise

VICTOR

God forgive me.

HENRY (O.S.)

I prayed never to see these again...

HENRY

Whatever they are.

HENRY

I won't bother asking what or why.

You wouldn't tell me anyway. I just

hope you know what you're doing...

(draws close)

...because if this is a repeat of

Ingolstadt, I won't be around to

pick up the pieces.

CREATURE

I want her.

VICTOR

Why... her?

CREATURE

Her body pleases me.

CREATURE

Materials, remember? Nothing more.

Your words.

VICTOR

My words.

VICTOR

The brain stem was destroyed by the

hanging. We'll need another. The

body looks like it will do, but some

extremities are too decayed. They'll

have to be replaced. The fresher the

better.

PROSTITUTE

Want some yourself? Or just like to

watch?

(draws close)

What do you say, lover? I can make

it good for you.

CREATURE

I know you can.

VICTOR

What is this?

CREATURE

A brain. Extremities.

VICTOR

This was not taken from a grave.

CREATURE

What does it matter? She'll live

again. You'll make her.

VICTOR

No. I draw the line.

CREATURE

You will honor your promise to me!

VICTOR

(through gritted teeth)

I will not! Kill me now!

CREATURE

That is mild compared to what will

come. If you deny me my wedding night.

I'll be with you on yours.

VICTOR

No. Not tomorrow, not next week,

Marry me today.

ELIZABETH

Why the change? What about your work?

VICTOR

It was misguided and pointless. Is

your answer yes?

ELIZABETH

It is

VICTOR

We'll leave this afternoon, right

after the ceremony. Pack only what

you need.

ELIZABETH

Does this have something to do with

that man you saw?

VICTOR

(hesitates)

Yes. We're in danger here. Every

moment we stay.

ELIZABETH

Victor, tell me why! Trust me!

VICTOR

I do. But you must trust me for now.

FATHER

This is not... the grand wedding...

I had hoped to give you...

PRIEST

We gather now in the sight of God to

witness this man and woman bond their

lives in matrimonial vow.

VICTOR

Be especially on your guard. Stay

cautious to a fault.

STABLE HAND

Who is this man, sir? How shall we

know him?

VICTOR

He is huge and deformed... and quite

insane.

CLAUDE

He killed Master William and sent

Justine Moritz to the noose! No

hesitation, lads! Shoot the bastard

on sight!

VICTOR

Are you sure you'll be all right?

HENRY

Yes, don't worry. I'll look after

your father. You look after her.

VICTOR

I'll be back as soon as I've got her

far away and safe. We'll hunt this

fiend down together.

HENRY

Only if you'll tell me who he is.

VICTOR

(hesitates)

I owe you that. Done.

FATHER

Victor?

PRIEST

(breathless with horror)

You're the Devil himself.

CREATURE

Yes, and I've come to snatch your

soul...

(leans close)

...unless you tell me where they've

gone.

CLAUDE

That was the last ferry. There's

nothing else till morning.

VICTOR

Damn it

CLAUDE

We'll ride on ahead and secure you

lodging for the night.

VICTOR

Make sure you keep your pistols dry

GUARD #2

They're dry enough. And if they fail,

we've others. And if those fail...

(draws his saber

halfway)

...we can always gut the bastard.

CLAUDE

Don't worry, sir. You're well guarded.

Now why don't you go upstairs to

your wife? It's not often a man has

his wedding night.

ELIZABETH

You're soaking.

ELIZABETH

Brother and sister no more.

VICTOR

Now husband and wife.

VICTOR

I remember the first time I ever saw

you. Crossing the floor of the grand

ballroom with my parents at your

side. So beautiful even then.

ELIZABETH

(a whisper)

I have been waiting for this ever

since.

ELIZABETH

Victor!

VICTOR

Open this door for no-one!

GUARD #2

I saw him in a flash of lightning!

He vanished toward the lake!

CLAUDE

Get after him!

CREATURE

Don't bother to scream.

GUARD #3

We lost him.

GUARD #4

Why are those open?

VICTOR

Elizabeth.

ELIZABETH

You don't want to hurt me.

CREATURE

You're more lovely than I could ever

have imagined.

VICTOR

ELIZABETH!

CREATURE

I keep my promises.

VICTOR

(softly)

Oh God... he took her heart... he

took her heart from me...

VICTOR

Live.

VICTOR

Say my name.

VICTOR

Elizabeth. Say my name. Say you

remember. Say my name.

VICTOR

You must. You must.

VICTOR

Say my name. Say you remember.

VICTOR

Yes. I'll help you remember.

VICTOR

...one-two-three, twirl-two-three.

CREATURE

She's beautiful.

VICTOR

She's not for you.

CREATURE

I'm sure the lady knows her own mind.

Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper

suitor.

VICTOR

Elizabeth, no!

(she turns, puzzled)

Say my name.

ELIZABETH

Vic... tor?

CREATURE

...no...

CREATURE

GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!

VICTOR

SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY

NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!

VICTOR

NO!

VICTOR

You killed her! You killed her!

CREATURE

We killed her.

HENRY

Victor.

VICTOR

All that I once loved lies in a

shallow grave. By my hand.

HENRY

Let it go.

VICTOR

You should have been my father's

son. He would have been so proud.

HENRY

VICTOR! COME BACK!

ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)

I followed his trail north... always

north... and always one step behind...

never stopping... driven by my fires

of rage... and revenge...

DISSOLVE TO:

VICTOR

A year now I've followed him. Perhaps

more. Only to arrive at this place.

Tired. So very tired. I never did

find... whatever it was... I was

looking for... and neither will you,

my friend.

(off Walton's look)

Value life above ambition... or those

glittering prizes you seek will

crumble to dust in your fingers...

as they have in mine.

(reaches out feverishly)

See your loved ones again. I cannot.

WALTON

Rest now.

WALTON

A warming wind.

GRIGORI

This ice will break yet.

(glances over)

How's our guest?

WALTON

He died. Raving about phantoms. He

was mad, poor devil.

(beat)

Gather a detail. Have the body removed

from my cabin.

GRIGORI

Aye, Captain.

WALTON

Who are you?

CREATURE

He never gave me a name.

CREATURE

You were with him at the end.

WALTON

(finds his voice)

Yes.

CREATURE

I was watching.

CREATURE

I longed to be with him. But I wanted

his final moments to have peace. I

could see you were a friend to him.

WALTON

What is that to you? Evil as you

are.

CREATURE

(swivels his gaze)

I am as he made me. In his own image.

WALTON

You drove him to his torment.

CREATURE

And he drove me to mine.

WALTON

Then why weep for him?

CREATURE

Would you not? He was father. And

mother. We fell from grace together.

He from his God. I from mine.

CREATURE

Could we ever have forgiven?

CREATURE

I've never been shown a kindness.

Show me one now.

WALTON

What kindness?

CREATURE

Build for him a pyre. Light up the

sky with his passing.

PILOT

(softly)

Christ.

WALTON

It has a right to bear witness.

WALTON

Stand fast. All of you.

OLD SAILOR

THE BITCH IS BREAKIN' UP!

GRIGORI

(whips toward Walton)

TORCH THE DAMN THING!

WALTON

BACK TO THE SHIP!

GRIGORI

LEAVE IT!

WALTON

GRIGORI!

WALTON

GRIGORI!

WALTON

SOMEBODY THROW ME A GAFF!

WALTON

Swim.

GRIGORI (SOFTLY)

Don't do it...

(screaming)

FOR GOD'S SAKE! DON'T DO IT!

CREATURE

For God's sake... I will.

WALTON
