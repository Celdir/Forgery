CHRIST COMPLEX

FADE IN:

CLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S LEG

A nervous leg shakes under the table. The appendage seems

to be attached to someone who has a lot on their mind.

INT. CAFE-DAY

LOUIS, a college student in his late twenties stares at a

friend who is sitting off screen. Louis is calm, almost

villainous in how collective he is.

He stares at this unseen friend, trying to assess the

cause for his anxious state.

LOUIS

(smug)

Something is bothering you...

We finally see QUINN, also in his late twenties. He is

obviously uneasy about being out in public with this

person.

QUINN

I appreciate the faux concern but I'm

fine.

Louis is taken aback.

LOUIS

My concern is genuine...

QUINN

With our history can you honestly say you

care about my well being?

LOUIS

Yes I can, our connection is a product of

destiny. I have no ill-will against you.

Quinn scoffs.

QUINN

1941-

LOUIS

-The Stephen Speilberg film?

QUINN

No, there was that little French girl I

liked. You..you violated her and torched

her farm killing her family-

2.

LOUIS

-Actually you are jacking up the story, I

violated her father in front of

her...then I torched the farm.

QUINN

Well...that makes it ten times better.

LOUIS

Quinn that was war, people do crazy

things midst of wide spread conflict. I

have gotten jaded over time. It's not

like the dark ages when I had style.

QUINN

When you would rape the horses and ride

away on the women?

LOUIS

Yeah I was such a ham.

(beat)

Quinn, this is what we do. I have gotten

carried away in the past, but now I'm

tired. I just want to get this over with.

It's our calling, we help bring order and

balance to the universe.

(beat)

Maybe I would feel less removed if you

would let me win just once.

QUINN

This isn't a 1930's boxing match. If I

take dive, I'm not lining the pockets of

some bookie...I'm bringing on the

apocalypse.

LOUIS

See at least our obligation would be

over.

QUINN

Louis I might be nervous, but I accept my

role as savior of this world.

(beat)

We have been doing this for years-

LOUIS

-centuries-

QUINN

-and in 5 days we will do the same thing

we have always done.

(MORE)

3.

QUINN (CONT'D)

(beat)

We'll fight to the death.

LOUIS

Atta' boy!

ZOEY

...I'm not saying this is an

intervention.

RICK

Wouldn't there be more people here if it

was an intervention?

ZOEY

See and I don't want it to be-

RICK

(disinterested)

-That's because it's not

ZOEY

It's just...I mean...are you gambling

again?

RICK

(totally removed)

Nope.

ZOEY

Because...um...the laptop, and you never

go anywhere with out it-

RICK

-it's my lifeline-

ZOEY

-Yeah well...I just know when I met you I

saved you from that downhill spiral...you

know...uh...the online poker-

4.

RICK

-I'm not a project, you know that right?

ZOEY

Of course not...I never said you were.

RICK

Because you act like it...I wonder if I

didn't have this "so called problem" if

you would have even been interested in

me.

ZOEY

Of course I would. I just-

RICK

-Take it upon yourself to save people.

ZOEY

OK...maybe. Honestly we have to save each

other, who else is going to do it.

RICK

(continued to be removed)

People could just save themselves.

ZOEY

True. Is that human nature? People rely

on false deities, self help books...Rick

the day I realized we were alone in the

universe was the day I realized we have

to be there for each other.

(beat)

Plus don't you find it romantic that I

want to save you? Like a movie...

RICK

So our relationship is like a romantic

comedy?

ZOEY

(dreamy)

A Cameron Crowe romantic comedy.

RICK

Oh well...so do you want to see what I'm

doing on the computer?

ZOEY

Yes...of course!

5.

RICK

Check that out Lloyd Dobler.

ZOEY

(Shocked)

Is that...porn?

RICK

Red Tube...like You Tube...but with porn.

ZOEY

Um....

(lightbulb)

wait...is that?

RICK

Oh yes...

ZOEY

Us having sex?

RICK

Oh yeah...

RICK (CONT'D)

I love the part coming up.

(beat)

You know where I put your legs behind

your head and yell "hump bunny!"

ZOEY

Yeah...um...I'm not OK with this...

RICK

Yeah...OK...I'm also breaking up with

you.

ZOEY

What?-

RICK

-Yeah not working any more for me-

ZOEY

What the hell?!? How is it not working?!?

RICK

You are yelling...you know I don't like

confrontational situations.

6.

ZOEY

I'm not trying to be confrontational...I

just...you are breaking up with me?

RICK

-Yeah...Can I have my laptop back now?

RICK (CONT'D)

(looking at the screen)

This part is fucking priceless.

LOUIS

This will do.

QUINN

So what are you wanting to do?

LOUIS

I figure we would train...

QUINN

Why?

LOUIS

Because you dominate me every time-

(beat)

-ohh that sounded dirty

QUINN

So you want me to help you get an

advantage?

7.

LOUIS

No, I want you to help me put on a good

show. Everyone loves a good climax Quinn.

ANNA

You know I don't like interjecting myself

into other people's affairs but-

ZOEY

(barley paying attention)

-But you're going to

ANNA

You let Rick do this to you.

ZOEY

(Snapping to it)

How so?

ANNA

You think you can change the men you are

with. You can't get into a relationship

with someone in the hopes that you can

mold them into the person you want them

to be.

ZOEY

Rick needed someone stable-

ANNA

-Rick needs castrated.

ZOEY

That's slightly strong.

ANNA

He was an asshole.

ZOEY

Misunderstood-

ANNA

-OK I'll meet you half

way...misunderstood asshole.

(beat)

You have been repeating the same cycle

your whole entire life.

8.

ZOEY

Now that's a little off base.

CUT TO:

ANNA (V.O.)

Remember Billy, who used to give kids the

"dirty bomb"? You took it upon yourself

to change this behavior-

ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

-This put you right in the cross-hairs to

be his next victim.

ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Good old Zack the neighbourhood drug

dealer-

ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

-You took it upon yourself to be his

personal savoir. What did it get you?

ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Well when Zach's old business partners

wanted to collect on a debt-

9.

ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

- they used you to replace their missing

coffee table they broke during a drunken

party.

ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

-And then you have Toothpick. What kind

of name is Toothpick?

ZOEY (V.O.)

It was his gang name.

ANNA (V.O.)

Of course.

ANNA (CONT'D)

We won't talk about prom night. Needless

to say it wasn't romantic.

BACK TO:

ZOEY

Exaggerations-

ANNA

-Accurate account of events... The story

of your romantic life-

ZOEY

-Unfair. Because these people need

someone who is going to sacrifice their

own needs for them.

10.

ANNA

Why?

ZOEY

Who else is going to do it? We're alone

in the universe. If we are going to make

it through this "crazy world" we need to

look out for each other.

ANNA

I think you use atheism and the whole "we

are alone in the universe" jive to

justify your actions.

(beat)

I regret taking you to see Dawkins

because you use that as a fall back to be

codependent.

ZOEY

First of all you are bitter about the

whole Dawkins thing, because you flashed

him your tits and got us kicked out-

ANNA

-You didn't even know the first thing

about "The God Delusion" until I gave you

a copy-

ZOEY

-And someone who was huge supporter turns

her back because Richard Dawkins didn't

like her nipple piercing-

ANNA

(playful banter)

-Enjoy your suite in hell non-believer-

ZOEY

(more banter)

-Enjoy your delusional life there fence

sitter. How about you pray to Thor to hit

me with a lighting bolt so I can be

removed from this asinine conversation.

ANNA

You're hiding behind this religious

debate because you don't want to admit

you have always gravitated toward the

"wrong type" of guy.

11.

ZOEY

(detached)

I actually stopped listening to you.

ANNA

What are you staring at?

ZOEY

Who are those guys?

ANNA

The one closest to us is Quinn. Very

weird, socially awkward type of guy. I

don't know who his friend is.

ZOEY

What are they doing?

ANNA

I don't know. Looks like that stuff my ex-

Rob was into-

ZOEY

Oh that medieval rugby style game-

ANNA

-Yeah the made up sport from "Blood Of

Heroes"...Oh...Jugger!-

ZOEY

-Sounds pornographic.

(beat)

So Quinn? What else do you know about

him?

ANNA

Oh no you don't! This is exactly what I

was talking about!

ANNA (CONT'D)

Wait a second? You've already established

contact with Quinn?

ZOEY

What is this MI-6?

ANNA

You have your sights on him already!

12.

ZOEY

No, I'm just curious.

ANNA

What happened?

DISSOLVE TO:

ZOEY

(making her way to the bench)

I'm so sorry

QUINN

(handing the ring back to her)

Is this yours?

ZOEY

Kinda... Again I'm so sorry.

QUINN

No need to apologize.

13.

QUINN (CONT'D)

Do you want to sit?

ZOEY

(unsure)

OK?

ZOEY (CONT'D)

(reaching her hand out)

I'm Zoey.

QUINN

(He returns the gesture)

Quinn.

(beat)

Zoey? Interesting.

ZOEY

Oh name? Yes, most people have

interesting stories behind their

names...Honestly I have nothing. Not sure

why my parents did that.

QUINN

Very unique.

ZOEY

(smiles)

I suppose that's a compliment. So I've

seen you around school, but never

really...in...class...

QUINN

I don't go to Marshall, I live near the

campus though.

ZOEY

Oh, well so what do you do?

QUINN

As in profession? I don't really have

one.

ZOEY

Really? Rent is insane around here...

QUINN

Yeah, my father provides for me.

ZOEY

That's pretty cool. What's he into?

14.

QUINN

ZOEY

QUINN

ZOEY

QUINN

ZOEY

QUINN

ZOEY

QUINN

ZOEY

QUINN

ZOEY

QUINN

ZOEY

QUINN

15.

ZOEY

I know.

(trying to double back)

I mean...I've seen you around

campus...you seem like a loner...I didn't

mean you were a loser. Loner is kind of

sexy, loser...well can kind of be

too...I'll stop.

QUINN

No, it's OK. I agree it never hurts to

have a friend.

ZOEY

So we can maybe go out to dinner if you

want?

QUINN

OK...

ZOEY

And I can pay, you know..make up for the

head...

QUINN

You really don't have to.

ZOEY

No I want to.

QUINN

OK.

ZOEY

Well...

(beat)

Good let's meet up tonight. My place,

7pm.

CUT TO:

16.

JACK

So when does Ted Bundy get here?

ANNA

I promised her we would behave.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Although knocking right as I sat down

doesn't endear him to me...

JACK

You sit your pretty little ass down

hooker.

ANNA

This is why I don't need a boyfriend. You

are way to good to me.

JACK

Look at this mother fucker.

JACK (CONT'D)

Zoey is in the bathroom getting ready for

a night of manipulation, sit the fuck

down.

QUINN

(confused)

Um...OK?

ZOEY

Quinn, is he being rude?

QUINN

(looking at Jack)

No quite pleasant.

17.

ZOEY

Let's go.

JACK

(looking at Quinn)

I will call the state police in a fucking

heart beat if she isn't here by midnight.

QUINN

(still confused)

OK?

ZOEY

Anna, you going to call the guard dog

off?

ANNA

(out of it)

David Smith's Candytakers is on tonight.

I'm relaxing and not getting in the

middle.

QUINN

(To Jack and Anna)

Nice meeting both of you.

JACK

Get the fuck out.

ZOEY

(to Jack and Anna)

Don't wait up

ZOEY

Sorry about Jack...

QUINN

I like him.

18.

QUINN

Zoey I would be more than happy to pay.

ZOEY

No not at all. This is on me.

QUINN

I can cover dessert at least.

ZOEY

Listen Quinn, I'm an atheist-

QUINN

-So you don't want dessert?-

ZOEY

-No, I just wanted to get it out of the

way. It bothers people, I mean in this

state especially.

QUINN

It doesn't bother me.

ZOEY

Really?

QUINN

I don't believe anyone is truly an

atheist at the end.

ZOEY

I'm pretty sure I'm really an atheist.

QUINN

Why's that?

ZOEY

Because I'm a logical thinker.

(beat)

I don't mean to offend, I'm guessing

you're religious.

QUINN

One supports the business they are in I

guess.

19.

ZOEY

QUINN

ZOEY

QUINN

ZOEY

QUINN

ZOEY

QUINN

ZOEY

QUINN

ZOEY

QUINN

ZOEY

QUINN

20.

ZOEY

So you are out with me...I represent

everything you were brought up to combat.

You're missing something and you are

looking for help.

QUINN

I am looking for help. I'm out with you

though because I'm interested in getting

to know you.

ZOEY

(smiles)

See I'm good at reading people.

QUINN

(rolls eyes, smiles)

Kind of.

ZOEY

I don't know Quinn you seem like a lost

soul. I thought that when I saw you by

the river.

QUINN

You like lost souls don't you?

ZOEY

Yeah I actually do. Someone needs to save

them.

QUINN

You going to save me?

ZOEY

If you let me.

QUINN

I think you might be able to.

ZOEY

(endearing smile)

So what do you need Quinn?

QUINN

(smiles)

Dessert.

21.

ANNA

I don't know, he seems fishy.

ZOEY

He seems harmless.

ANNA

I have heard that a million times.

ZOEY

I know. He's in the ministry-

ANNA

-and you hate organized religion.

ZOEY

I know and he's understanding of that.

ANNA

Plus it's to my understanding he didn't

actually admit what he did. He just did a

bunch of double talk.

ZOEY

It was understood.

ANNA

Yeah again...not feeling confident in

your choices. Please Zoey...

(beat)...

Be careful this time.

LOUIS

Where were you last night?

22.

QUINN

(getting his bearings)

Out...thinking.

LOUIS

You've done a lot of mopping and thinking

over the centuries. It kind of brings me

down.

QUINN

So what do you need?

LOUIS

Training.

LOUIS

Now this is a place for a climatic

battle.

QUINN

Not bad.

QUINN (CONT'D)

What's in the bag?

LOUIS

You will love this.

LOUIS (CONT'D)

I went to the toy store last night and

picked these up.

LOUIS (CONT'D)

Nothing like our real stuff, but it will

do.

QUINN

(catching it)

It's kind of lightweight..and silly.

23.

LOUIS

Come on give it a chance.

LOUIS

You have not been lively at all this go

around.

QUINN

A lot on my mind...

LOUIS

We only do this once every seventy years

brother. You have to enjoy it while it

lasts.

QUINN

Louis our whole purpose here, is to show

up, and over time establish a social

base, and then kill each other.

LOUIS

You know and I'm very good at the social

base part, and you are not so good...

QUINN

That's because you find a way to screw it

up every time.

LOUIS

That's because, I know this is news to

you, I represent evil.

(MORE)

24.

LOUIS (CONT'D)

Here's the thing though, I'm tired Quinn.

I really want to stop being the

ambassador for this.

QUINN

That's something we agree on. I'm tired

too.

LOUIS

I don't know if we can get off this

train. It's just a viscous cycle.

QUINN

Letting you win is not an option.

LOUIS

I wasn't going there...

(beat)

...yet.

ZOEY (O.S.)

You guys leaving?

JACK

Yeah we don't want to interrupt your

"date rape".

ANNA

Jesus Jack! He can't do anything here

anyway. Too much exposure. Witnesses my

friend...We knew he was here.

ZOEY

Will you guys stop??

QUINN

It's OK. I like your friends.

ANNA

So Quinn?

25.

QUINN

Yes?

ANNA

Zoey says you are in the ministry?

QUINN

Sort of.

ANNA

You are or you aren't.

QUINN

It's complicated.

ANNA

At some point you will have to explain it

to Zoey. I mean don't you agree?

QUINN

Well...

ZOEY

(put out)

Will you guys leave??

JACK

Who is going too far now?

ANNA

"Date Rape"

ZOEY

(trying to make a point)

Bye guys!

ZOEY (CONT'D)

(turning to Quinn)

Sorry about that.

QUINN

It's really OK.

26.

JACK

You know I hate him because it's my

nature but-

ANNA

-You think I hate him because of my

distrust of men?

JACK

Tragedy changes people, it effected Zoey

in one way...you in another.

ANNA

Yeah

(beat,smiles)

I became a "fag hag"

BACK TO:

ZOEY

Tonight's Feature Presentation is "I am

Curious:Yellow". Probably not the best

date movie, but I always show this to

ever guy in the beginning.

QUINN

It's OK this will be my first film

experience.

ZOEY

What??

QUINN

Yeah, I've never seen a film before. I

mean I know of films, can't live in this

world and not. I've just never seen one.

ZOEY

This might be a little hard-core for your

first film.

QUINN

No it's OK. I'm excited.

27.

ZOEY

I feel like I'm stealing your virginity

here.

ZOEY (CONT'D)

You're a virgin too aren't you?

ZOEY (CONT'D)

Oh my god! I'm a bad girl.

QUINN

(smiles)

You are not.

QUINN (CONT'D)

Please play the film.

ZOEY

(hesitant)

OK? I mean I usually play this for

potential boyfriends. If they can handle

this, they can handle me.

ZOEY (CONT'D)

I guess you're lucky I thought about

"They Call Her One Eye".

(to herself)

I hope this doesn't jack you up.

JUMP CUT TO:

QUINN

(monotone)

I am curious Yellow...

28.

LOUIS

What the hell are you talking about?

QUINN

Nothing really.

LOUIS

You half asleep Quinn?

LOUIS (CONT'D)

Look at that ladies and gentleman the

apocalypse has begun.

QUINN

Have you ever seen a movie?

LOUIS

I've seen plenty of movies.

QUINN

Really?

LOUIS

Yeah I watched "The Sorrow and The Pity"

at Marshal the other day. You know people

here have yet to figure out we are not

students.

QUINN

I think they have a pretty good idea.

LOUIS

So in all the times we have been here,

you haven't gone to the cinema?

QUINN

No...

LOUIS

Why not?

29.

QUINN

It's not what we are here to do.

LOUIS

In your bosses name, what is wrong with

you? You've got to enjoy yourself. You

might be chosen, but you have needs. We

all do.

QUINN

I have to stay focused.

LOUIS

You've also burned yourself out. You're

not going to be any good to me...

LOUIS (CONT'D)

...unless you take some "you" time.

LOUIS (CONT'D)

Can we get back to the matter at hand?

30.

LOUIS

(to himself)

You are a handsome devil.

LOUIS

(puzzled)

Weird?

RYAN BLOOD

You looking for Quinn?

LOUIS

Yes?

RYAN BLOOD

(nodding toward the exit door)

He just left.

31.

LOUIS

(to himself)

What do we have here?

ZOEY

Why haven't I seen your place?

QUINN

My place isn't very exciting.

ZOEY

That doesn't surprise me. I can't imagine

you having a vast Blu Ray collection.

QUINN

Blu Ray?

ZOEY

Wow...Quinn, you have to start enjoying

the world around you.

QUINN

You know I realized today you are right

about that.

ZOEY

So you're saying you want to come up

stairs and watch "They Call Her One Eye"?

QUINN

(laughs)

Uh...no. I'm still trying to get I am

Curious Yellow out of my head.

ZOEY

Yeah...sorry about that...

32.

QUINN

(smiles)

It's OK.

ZOEY

I...I..I'm sorry.

QUINN

No don't be.

ZOEY

I shouldn't have been that aggressive.

QUINN

No...it's OK.

ZOEY

OK?

QUINN

I need to get back though.

ZOEY

Puzzling...but I know...virgin and all-

QUINN

-Well...I mean...

ZOEY

That came out rude...I just mean...I

wanted to do it. I should have taken it

slower.

QUINN

It's OK. I'll be by tomorrow.

ZOEY

You sure?

QUINN

Yes of course.

ZOEY

(worried)

I hope so.

33.

RYAN BLOOD

You're here to learn more about his

"coming and goings". To find out what I

have seen.

LOUIS

So far you are dead on.

RYAN BLOOD

It's more than that Louis-

LOUIS

-You know who I am?

RYAN BLOOD

I know pretty much everything. I've

watched you, studied you...I feel I'm

expert on your little game every seventy

years.

LOUIS

Really?

RYAN BLOOD

Oh yes.

RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

You battled as mortals-

(beat)

(MORE)

34.

RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

-You were a Lamanite then-

(beat)

-Quinn was a commander of the Nephites,

last survivor of that nation-

(beat)

-The savoir spoke to him, showed him his

future...his destiny-

(beat)

-See after the death of Christ there was

some debate on what was going to bring on

the end and signal his return-

(beat)

- It was decided two great warriors had

to fight. The winner would determine the

start of the apocalypse. Your boss of

course needed someone to represent his

interests. Who better than Quinn's old

adversary?

LOUIS

Where are you going with this you weird

little man?

RYAN BLOOD

You had strategy in the beginning. Middle

Ages...Old West...Even World War II.

(beat)

Let's take a step back for a second. The

Old West. Lack of faith, corruption,

these things make Quinn weak. The chink

in his armor is his faith in people. You

knew that, and corrupting America...a

young land...was the key.

(beat)

Quinn was a step ahead of you, and looked

for a human ally. That ally was Joseph

Smith, and Quinn...or I mean Moroni...led

Joseph to the plates that later when into-

RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

-His little plan didn't work, but the

book is a great coffee table discussion

piece. This made him weak Louis. You

could have destroyed him. The problem is

you've allowed yourself to become fond of

him. YOU need to embrace your destiny.

LOUIS

How do I do that?

35.

RYAN BLOOD

This girl is distracting him. Get his

mind focused on the matter at hand. At

this point I'm afraid he isn't even going

to fight you.

LOUIS

I'm surprised this girl even likes Quinn.

He comes across creepy.

RYAN BLOOD

Maybe that's the key-

LOUIS

(lightbulb)

-Make her think he's crazy.

LOUIS

Where have you been?

QUINN

You've been waiting long?

LOUIS

No I figured you were on your way back-

QUINN

-because you are spying on me again? So I

don't need to tell you where I've been.

LOUIS

Who's the girl?

QUINN

It's started again. You're already

jealous. You are going to do the same

thing you did during the war...you're

going to sabotage this.

LOUIS

I'm insulted frankly.

36.

QUINN

Don't you play that game. You are being

facetious.

LOUIS

No, I'm being serious. You care about the

girl, it's obvious. Not in a friendship

or I'm curious about human behavior way.

QUINN

So why are you here?

LOUIS

Have you told her?

QUINN

Who I am? Of course not!

LOUIS

Quinn you only have a few days left and

you care for this girl-

(beat)

- What's the harm in telling her?

QUINN

There's a lot of harm in telling her.

LOUIS

If this is real and you really care for

this girl, you have to tell her. It's

only fair to her.

QUINN

She has a best friend who is very guarded

of me...It's odd she eluded to the same

thing. You know the whole "I'm hiding

something, and I need to come out into

the open" thing.

LOUIS

Sounds to me like she is right.

QUINN

Well I better do this now then.

LOUIS

Yeah you don't want to lose your nerve.

QUINN

Can you let yourself out?

37.

LOUIS

Of course.

ANNA

What the hell?

JACK (O.S.)

What the fuck?!? I want to watch Bring me

the Head of Alfredo Garcia in peace!

QUINN

I need to see Zoey.

ANNA

What about tomorrow? Or never is good.

ZOEY (O.S.)

What's going on??

ZOEY (CONT'D)

Quinn? What's wrong?

QUINN

I need to talk to you, it's important.

ANNA

Jesus Christ!

38.

QUINN

I need to tell you everything. Anna is so

right.

ZOEY

What are you talking about? Anna is

right?

QUINN

I've not been honest with you about what

I do...or who I am.

ZOEY

OK?

QUINN

I need to come clean. I want you to trust

me. I want your friends to trust me.

ZOEY

(nervous laugh)

OK Quinn, just spit it out.

QUINN

OK

(beat)

I'm an archangel named Moroni and I

basically represent "light" or everything

that's good. Louis, my friend, represents

"darkness". Every seventy years we have

to fight to the death. If I win

everything stays the way it is. The world

continues turning. If I lose, Louis takes

on the role of the Antichrist and the

apocalypse will be unleashed. I'm talking

Book of Revelations stuff here. So I only

have a limited time left in this world...

(beat)

I want to spend that time with you.

ZOEY

Oh honey...

ZOEY (CONT'D)

You must have a brain tumor or something.

You're obviously mentally ill.

QUINN

Zoey? I...

39.

ZOEY

Shhh. You need me more than ever.

CUT TO:

DAD

You're not even helping me!

MOM

I don't even know what you want!

DAD

I can't run my congregation with this

sickness!

MOM

The sickness is in your head.

DAD

You're too busy running around doing

whatever you feel like. I'm going to fall

apart and it's all on you.

40.

JUMP CUT TO:

JUMP CUT TO:

QUINN

Last night?

ZOEY

Yes?

QUINN

Did you?

ZOEY

Enjoy myself? Of course.

41.

QUINN

Based on how you are acting this morning

I have my doubts. That's not what I meant

though. You woke up screaming.

ZOEY

It was nothing.

QUINN

I understand if you don't want to talk

about it. I'm just concerned.

ZOEY

It's not a big deal. It was...a...well

wouldn't call it a nightmare...repressed

memory. Hell, it's not repressed...I

think of it all the time.

QUINN

What is it?

ZOEY

You don't want to hear about it.

QUINN

Please?

ZOEY

My father, I mentioned him before, was a

Baptist minister. He always said he had

this "sickness". He begged my mom for

help, it was more important though for

her to having shopping and dinner dates

with her girlfriends. Anna, my friend

that "loves you", has been in my life

since I was tiny. She used to come over

all the time. My Dad adored her. When I

was around twelve I found something in

the closet...tapes. My Dad and Anna from

the time she was like seven...He...

(starts tearing up)

I showed my Mom, and Dad...well he got

out of prison when I was seventeen. I

don't see him anymore. His church, even

though they knew he had a problem

disowned him. He wouldn't have done that

to Anna if my mom would have supported

him, got him help.

42.

QUINN

Who do you think is to blame?

ZOEY

He tried to get help Quinn, he reached

out to my Mom. I should have protected

Anna too...I mean-

QUINN

-None of this was your fault.

ZOEY

I have to protect people. This was out of

my control, you Quinn...What's going on

with you...I have control of that.

QUINN

I love being with you.

ZOEY

Me too.

QUINN

I can't renege on my responsibilities

with Louis though.

ZOEY

You're not actually going to fight your

friend to the death are you?

QUINN

I know you don't understand this. We just

need to make the most of our time.

ZOEY

Quinn, in 2 days things are going to be

normal. This is just a delusion.

QUINN

I know you don't understand. I just need

to go see Louis today.

43.

ZOEY

I understand that.

ZOEY

What is it?

ZOEY

What was wrong?

QUINN

My neighbor Ryan Blood...looks like he's

spying on me.

ZOEY

What are you talking about?

QUINN

I need to go see Louis.

LOUIS

(sitting down)

I thought him admitting his true self

would break them up-

44.

RYAN BLOOD

-Instead he is still hot and heavy with

her.

(beat)

He even did the "bipty boom" last night.

LOUIS

The fight is pointless.

RYAN BLOOD

It's not pointless. The game has just

changed is all.

(beat)

We have two levels here: one is making

sure we keep him engaged.

(beat)

Honestly though that's an afterthought at

this point-

LOUIS

So what's the next move?

RYAN BLOOD

(still searching)

Well when he does become engaged...

RYAN BLOOD (O.S.) (CONT'D)

...We need to make sure you still have

the advantage.

ANNA

What are you doing?

45.

ZOEY

I haven't heard from Quinn since he

wigged out today.

ANNA

Well honestly maybe that's a good thing.

ZOEY

He needs me.

ANNA

He doesn't need you! Not everyone needs

you!

ZOEY

(frustrated)

This isn't about me and you-

ANNA

-This is about me and you! You think you

can make up for what happened. The fact

you didn't notice, couldn't save me in

time. You were a child! I was a child!

You couldn't have saved your father

either! Your mother couldn't have, no one

could have! He was a fucking pedophile!

ANNA (CONT'D)

Hate me all you want, but it's impossible

to redeem yourself for things you had no

control over.

JACK

Just show her the fucking file.

ZOEY

(confused)

What fucking file?

46.

QUINN

We have a problem.

LOUIS

You're right. We do.

LOUIS

I thought coming here would give us some

privacy from Quinn.

RYAN BLOOD

I think it worked out perfectly.

ZOEY

So is the file folder for dramatic

effect?

JACK

No it was to keep everything organized...

(beat)

...and for dramatic effect.

ZOEY

Quinn?

47.

QUINN

Ryan Blood!

ZOEY

You mentioned that earlier. What is going

on?

QUINN

He's with Louis. They're planning to kill

me.

ZOEY

I thought that was the whole plan.

QUINN

No it's...this isn't like Louis. I think

he is trying to cheat his way to a win.

ZOEY

Why don't you come over here.

QUINN

I can't!

ZOEY

Come on Quinn get a grip. Just calm down

and come over here.

QUINN

You're right.

ZOEY

OK so just come on over and we'll talk.

QUINN

No I mean you're right. I need to get

control of myself. I have a destiny. I

need to figure out my next move.

ZOEY

Quinn? No wait-

JACK

What is it?

48.

ZOEY

I don't know. He's losing it.

JACK

You need to look at this.

JACK (CONT'D)

I spent a lot of time gathering that

information.

ZOEY

So what is all this?

JACK

Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks were

orphans.

JACK (CONT'D)

Quinn displayed some erratic behavior

from the beginning. One of the staff

members was Mormon and they would read

stories to Quinn out of the Book Of

Mormon. That employee was later fired,

but a seed was planted in Quinn's head.

He kept going on about how he and Louis

were meant to fight to the death. Some of

the children at the time claim Louis

would encourage this behavior. He

probably thought this was Quinn's attempt

at playing.

(beat)

As things continued the staff at the

orphanage thought Quinn needed help

beyond what they could offer. They sent

Quinn to a hospital.

ZOEY

You're not telling me anything I didn't

already know.

ANNA

That makes it worse. You're going to

continue this now that you know for a

fact that he is nuts?

49.

ZOEY

I'm too far into this now. I don't have a

choice.

JACK

Why don't you let us save you? Please

Zoey.

ZOEY

Let me be guys.

JACK

(rousing up)

Ehhh...what? You better be a hot bear of

a man.

JACK (CONT'D)

Or Zoey...What do you need hun?

ZOEY

What's this?

JACK

Looks like a room list from the psych

hospital.

50.

ZOEY

I gathered that. Under Quinn's room...

JACK

Quinn and his roommate is listed.

ZOEY

Quinn's roommate was Ryan Blood?

JACK

Yeah...looks that way.

ZOEY

Ah fuck.

JUMP CUT TO:

RYAN BLOOD

We need to talk.

LOUIS

About?

RYAN BLOOD

Strategy.

LOUIS

Strategy?

RYAN BLOOD

Yes. I have a method-

LOUIS

-I have to hear this.

RYAN BLOOD

A 12 point system-

LOUIS

(confused)

- Like 12 steps?

51.

RYAN BLOOD

Exactly. It's a sure fire plan to throw

Quinn off of his game

LOUIS

Oh I am so all ears.

RYAN BLOOD

Well the first thing you need is a battle

cry.

LOUIS

Excuse me? A battle cry?

RYAN BLOOD

Yes a battle cry. Every great warrior has

one.

LOUIS

And a battle cry is going to give me the

advantage in battle?

RYAN BLOOD

Of course it will. Why don't you try one

out?

LOUIS

What?

RYAN BLOOD

Yeah, try one out right now. It's

liberating.

LOUIS

I'd rather not.

RYAN BLOOD

Come on.

LOUIS

(extremely confused)

Right here?

RYAN BLOOD

Here I'll go first-

LOUIS

That was...interesting.

52.

RYAN BLOOD

See?

(beat)

Your turn.

LOUIS

So right now?

RYAN BLOOD

Of course.

RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

Oh come on! That sounds like you are

scared of the battle. What? Are you

scared of Quinn? You probably are-

RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

That's good! Come on!

RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

Yes that's what I'm talking about!

RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)

(noticing Quinn)

Quinn?!? Good to see you!

QUINN

We need to talk.

LOUIS

(to Ryan)

Excuse me for a second.

QUINN

I know that guy and I don't trust him.

53.

LOUIS

I don't trust you anymore.

QUINN

Your new friend is dangerous.

LOUIS

So is yours.

QUINN

Leave her out of this.

LOUIS

You fighting tomorrow morning Quinn?

QUINN

It's over. This whole thing is nuts. I'm

walking away.

LOUIS

Let me walk away from you first then.

LOUIS (CONT'D)

I'm coming at you! You are in this game

like it or not!

ZOEY

Excuse me?

JAKE

(monotone)

Yes.

54.

ZOEY

I'm looking for Mrs. Rhodes. I believe

the people here referred to her as

"mother".

JAKE

(monotone)

People look for a lot of things.

ZOEY

I'm sure they do.

(looking at the boxes)

You guys shutting down?

JAKE

(monotone)

We are ceasing operations.

ZOEY

Is there something wrong with you?

MRS. RHODES

Calm down. You need to calm down and

count to ten.

ZOEY

What? I don't know what that means.

MRS. RHODES

You have to calm down and meditate.

ZOEY

Um...no...listen do you know Quinn Wilson

and Louis Marks? They grew up here.

MRS. RHODES

No...You need to leave!

ZOEY

What?

55.

MRS. RHODES

And give me your shirt.

ZOEY

Um...no.

MRS. RHODES

You better make your peace with God girl!

The end is coming, those boys are

ushering in a new era!

ZOEY

What a fucking nut house!

JAKE (O.S.)

(monotone)

Excuse me!

ZOEY

What!

JAKE

(monotone)

I know the young boys you speak of.

ZOEY

(doesn't care)

And?

JAKE

(monotone)

I was here when Quinn got sent to the

mental hospital. It was like the other

one set it up.

ZOEY

Wait Louis? You think Louis made Quinn

appear crazy?

56.

JAKE

(monotone)

They both believed the same thing. Louis

was just smart enough to hide it.

ZOEY

There is more to it than that.

JAKE

(monotone)

I don't understand

ZOEY

Listen "Robot Boy", where did this whole

belief come from? This isn't something

two kids come up with on their own.

JAKE

(monotone)

Yes I believe a seed was planted.

ZOEY

Exactly. I heard there was an employee

that got fired for sharing Mormon

mythology with the boys.

JAKE

(monotone)

No. Off base. He's not the right one.

JACK

You might be right sweetheart. The

employee I was telling you about earlier

was instrumental in getting Appleridge

Orphanage shut down.

ZOEY

How?

57.

JACK

ZOEY

JACK

JACK

58.

ZOEY

I'm going to stop an Apocalyptic battle.

JACK

Goddamn Zoey!

ANNA

So where is she at now?

JACK

I got a text about thirty minutes ago.

I'm pretty sure she is going to head to

Quinn's apartment.

ANNA

Jack...

JACK

What?

ANNA

Her Christ Complex is going to get her

killed.

JACK

Trust me I know Anna.

(beat)

I know...

JACK (CONT'D)

Maybe it's Quinn the jackass.

59.

RYAN BLOOD

Good afternoon boys and girls! I need

your assistance.

QUINN

How do people keep ending up in my room?

ZOEY

(laughs)

You need to learn to lock up.

QUINN

I'm not fighting Louis.

ZOEY

Why the change of heart?

QUINN

I think you might be right. I don't think

it's necessary. I think the world will

keep turning one way or another. I'm not

dependant on that.

(beat)

I'm not a savior.

ZOEY

Do you really believe? You know?

QUINN

Yes. I do believe it. I know it actually.

Since I have been with you, I've doubted

what I know to be fact though. Then it

hit me, it really doesn't matter.

ZOEY

I'll help you Quinn. I don't want to do

it for myself...

(MORE)

60.

ZOEY (CONT'D)

I don't want to do it because I feel I

have to. Obligations, or dark incidents

from my past...That's not a reason to

help anyone. It makes me fucking selfish

actually.

QUINN

You're not selfish Zoey.

ZOEY

I care about you Quinn. That's sincerely

my reason for wanting to do this. That's

a first for me you know?

QUINN

I know...

JUMP CUT TO:

QUINN

(in pain)

Let her go!

RYAN BLOOD

(looking at Quinn)

Let me pretty the girl up a bit

LOUIS

Hold on sunshine!

61.

CUT TO:

JACK

Mother fucker!

QUINN

Where's Zoey?

JACK

Fuck you mother fucker! I'm going to call

the fucking fuzz once you untie me!

Fucking nut bag, ball sac-

QUINN

(like he is talking to a retarded child)

I...will...come...rescue...you

62.

JACK

Ass fuck salad-

QUINN

That actually felt kind of good.

QUINN (CONT'D)

I'll be back guys.

CUT TO:

63.

ZOEY

I'm not doing it anymore. You will not

have redemption from me.

DAD

(raspy)

Zoey...

ZOEY

Take ownership of what you did. Don't

rely on me to save you. I need to start

saving myself.

ZOEY (CONT'D)

(as she is turning)

Goodbye.

JUMP CUT TO:

LOUIS

What do you think Zoey? I'm a ninja!

ZOEY

(struggling under Ryan's grip)

You're fucking crazy!

ZOEY

65.

RYAN BLOOD

She was my caretaker. She told me she was

sending me someone. Someone I would have

to guide on to the right path.

ZOEY

Guys I have let my parents fuck me up.

There comes a time though where you have

to go out on your own. Take

responsibility for your own life.

RYAN BLOOD

There is a much bigger purpose. You'll

see.

ZOEY

This whole thing was to carry out some

delusional woman's master plan. She

doesn't even remember who she is at this

point. I went to see her...she wanted me

to take off my shirt.

LOUIS

Will you shut up?!? You are ruining my

climatic fight.

LOUIS (CONT'D)

Showtime.

QUINN

Let her go!

RYAN BLOOD

Not yet...

66.

QUINN

LOUIS

You don't get it do you.

LOUIS

LOUIS

QUINN

LOUIS

67.

RYAN BLOOD

He's pitting us against each other.

QUINN

I'm going to be honest with you Louis.

I've always been honest.

LOUIS

Yeah sometimes to a fault.

QUINN

We have always played this game as honest

as we could. We never did anything to

undermine the other. Despite what you

represent, you have moral code.

(beat)

You are not acting with in that code

today.

LOUIS

I'm tired of losing...

QUINN

You're losing right now. Your actions,

you can't win like this. Not acting this

way.

LOUIS

I'm tired of you. I'm going to end it!

QUINN

You going to shoot me?

LOUIS

It's the endgame.

LOUIS (CONT'D)

OK...I guess I do have some morals.

68.

ZOEY

What the fuck!

QUINN

Zoey go home. We need to finish this.

ZOEY

No you don't. Guys what are you doing?

LOUIS

Go home girl!

ZOEY

Are you being serious?

QUINN

I will always love you. You have to go

though.

ZOEY

If you don't walk away from this field

right now, you will lose me. I will not

be in your corner. I will call for help.

They will stop you.

QUINN

Go...

ZOEY

Quinn...last chance.

ZOEY (CONT'D)

I will call the police Quinn...

QUINN

Goodbye.

ZOEY

(tearing up)

Wow...yeah goodbye.

69.

ZOEY

(laughs to herself)

I am Curious:Yellow

(beat)

Goodbye boys...

CUT TO:

70.

ZOEY

For years we have thought absence of the

impossible indicated that we were

exercising free thought. In my experience

ladies and gentleman, that's not the

case.

(beat)

Believing in hope my friends, opening

yourself up to accepting there might be

more than the world around you. That's

truly being a free thinker.

JENNIFER

Hey Grandma.

ZOEY

Hey...

JENNIFER

You look solemn.

ZOEY

Just sitting here...thinking...

JENNIFER

What are you thinking about?

ZOEY

I've had a great life. A wonderful

husband, children, grandchildren...

(motions to Jennifer)

...great grandchildren...I spent so much

of my youth being angry. I wish I could

relive my life now, knowing what I know.

JENNIFER

You do have a lot of wisdom.

71.

ZOEY

I've tried to pass it on to you.

JENNIFER

You've taught me a lot.

ZOEY

Just remember, you can believe what you

want to believe Jennifer. Live by what

ever moral code you want to live by. Just

make sure it's yours. Don't let it stem

from anger or past tragedies.

(beat)

Let it come from your heart.

ZOEY (CONT'D)

What is it?

JENNIFER

My new boyfriend. The one I wanted you to

meet.

BOYFRIEND

(nervous)

Nice to meet to ma'am.

ZOEY

(shakes his hand)

Likewise.

JENNIFER

We better get going. We're going to grab

something to eat.

ZOEY

(to the boyfriend)

I didn't catch your name.

BOYFRIEND

I'm so sorry. I'm being rude.

72.

JENNIFER

(laughs)

He can be like that.

BOYFRIEND

I'm Louis.

JENNIFER

(to Zoey)

You OK?

ZOEY

Yeah I'm fine.

(snapping out of it)

Enjoy dinner.

JENNIFER

See you later on.

BOYFRIEND

(making eye contact with Zoey, smiling)

Nice to meet you.

ZOEY

(returning contact, and smiles)

Likewise.

FADE OUT.
