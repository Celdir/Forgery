Pleasantville - by Gary Ross - October 7, 1996

PLEASANTVILLE

A Fairytale by Gary Ross

October 7, 1996

"He was part of my dream of course

but then I was part of his dream too."

- Lewis Carroll "Through the looking glass"

COLLEGE COUNSELOR

... For those of you going on to college

next year, the chance of finding a good

job will actually decrease by the time

you graduate. Entry level jobs will drop

from thirty-one to twenty-six percent,

and the median income for those jobs

will go down as well ...

COLLEGE COUNSELOR (CONT)

Obviously, my friends, it's a

competitive world and good grades are

your only ticket through. By the year

Two Thousand  ...

HEALTH TEACHER

... The chance of contracting HIV from a

promiscuous lifestyle will climb to one

in one hundred and fifty. The odds of

dying in an auto accident are only one

in twenty-five hundred.

(beat)

Now this marks a drastic increase ...

SCIENCE TEACHER

... From just four years ago when ozone

depletion was at ten percent of its

current level. By the time you are

twenty years old, average global

temperature will have risen two and a

half degrees. Even a shift of one

degree can cause such catastrophic

consequences as typhoons, floods,

widespread drought and famine.

SCIENCE TEACHER

(chipper classroom tone)

Okay. Who can tell me what famine is?

CUT TO:

MAN'S VOICE (OS)

Honey, I'm home.

WOMAN'S VOICE (OS)

Hello darling.

BETTY

How was your day?

GEORGE

Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said

that if things keep going the way they

are, I might be seeing that promotion

sooner than I thought.

BETTY

Oh darling that's wonderful!

(an adoring gaze)

I always knew you could do it.

GEORGE (OS)

(on T.V.)

Hey, Pumpkin! What's that smell?

(sniffing)

Is that your meat loaf?

DAVID

(by rote)

"It might be ..."

BETTY (OS)

(shy smile)

It might be.

GEORGE (OS)

Oh Pumpkin! You sure know the way to

this man's heart.

DAVID'S MOM (OS)

... Bullshit Barry, that wasn't the

deal

DAVID'S MOM

No--you have custody the first weekend

of every month and this is the first

weekend ...

(pause)

I don't care if yesterday was the

thirtieth, this is still the first

weekend.

DAVID'S MOM (OS)

No I can't bail you out, I'm supposed to

go to La Costa ...

(beat)

Well if I want to get a mud bath, that's

really my business, isn't it?

GEORGE

(on T.V.)

Hey. Where are those kids?

DAVID

(reciting--a little louder)

"Right behind you father."

BUD AND MARY SUE TOGETHER

(on T.V.)

Right behind you father.

MARYSUE

Mother ... Father ... Bud has a little

surprise for you.

BETTY

What's that Bud?

BUD

First prize at the science fair. There

were lots of swell projects--guess mine

was just the "swellest".

BETTY

Darling that's wonderful. Except there's

no such word as "swellest".

BUD

Well gee whizz, Mom. lt wasn't the

"English" fair.

DAVID'S MOM (OS)

Well sure they can stay by themselves,

Barry, but that's not the point. You

said you'd take them.

(beat)

Well fine--they'll stay by themselves

then.

DAVID

(quietly)

What's a mother to do?

BETTY(OS)

(on T.V.)

Oh--what's a mother to do?

CUT TO:

DAVID

Hi. I mean ...

(pause)

... Hi.

DAVID

Look. You probably don't think I should

be asking you this. I mean--not knowing

you well and all ...

DAVID

(pause ...)

I mean I know you--everybody knows you

... I just don't know you ...

technically.

DAVID

Well--I was just wondering--'cause I see

you all the time in Algebra and I heard

you humming that Van Halen song and I

really like that song too ...

(pause)

Anyhow, I don't know what you're doing

this weekend but my Mom's leaving town

and she said I could use her car so ...

CUT TO:

HOWARD

Okay, whose window did Bud break when he

was playing with his father's golf

clubs?

DAVID

Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr.

Jenkins have?

DAVID (CONT)

Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name

the cat they found in the gutter?

HOWARD

Scout?

DAVID

Marmalade.

DAVID (CONT)

Okay--here's one: Why did their parents

come home early from their weekend at

the lake?

DAVID (CONT)

'Cause Bud didn't answer the phone and

they were worried about him.

HOWARD

You're unbelievable. You'll win this

thing for sure. When is it on?

DAVID

Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's

tomorrow at noon.

HOWARD

(weighing it)

A thousand dollars ... And it's on all

night?

DAVID

Of course it is Howard. That's why they

call it a Marathon.

CUT TO:

KIMMY

Omigod, it's so mortifying, being

related to him. I can't believe you're

like--

JENNIFER

Only on my parent's side.

KIMMY

I know, but you're like ... twins and

stuff.

(beat)

You must be from like, the cool side of

the uterus.

KIMMY (CONT)

Omigod, omigod--here they come.

CHRISTIN

Don't do anything. Just don't like--do

anything ...

JENNIFER

(cooly)

Hi Mark.

MARK

(to Jennifer)

Hey.

JENNIFER

(right back)

Hey.

MARK'S LACKEYS

(to Jennifer's lackies)

Hey.

JENNIFER'S LACKEYS

(back to them)

Hey.

MARK

Saw you at the mall yesterday.

JENNIFER

Yeah ... Saw you too.

JENNIFER (CONT)

So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV

tonight?

MARK

Yeah.

(beat)

JENNIFER

My mom'll be out of town.

MARK

So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...

JENNIFER

(smiling)

Cool.

MARK

(nodding faster)

Cool.

VARIOUS LACKEYS

Cool.

CUT TO:

JENNIFER (VO)

... I know, I know--He's just like so

FINE ... I'm still like: "Omigod."

JENNIFER

It was amazing, Daph ... I'm like:

"Well my Mom'll be out of town." And

he's like "Well then, maybe we could--

you know ..." And I'm like "Yeah, sure."

And he's like "Well, cool."

(beat)

I know, he's just so smart.

(pause ...)

I don't know. Maybe that black thing I

just got.

(pause ...)

It is not slutty, Daph, it's cute.

(pause ... )

Well, "hello?" He's not coming  over

here to study ...

(beat)

I know. Well I'm jealous of you too

sometimes.

DAVID

... He's not homeless Howard, they just

don't say where he lives.

(pause ...)

Well it's a silly question.

(pause ...)

Because nobody's homeless in

Pleasantville.

DAVID

... because that's just not what it's

like.

DAVID (CONT)

Listen Howard--it's almost six-thirty.

I gotta go.

JENNIFER

(stunned)

What are you doing?

DAVID

What are you doing?

JENNIFER

David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna

like be here in five minutes.

DAVID

Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon

starts at six thirty.

JENNIFER

Pleasantville Marathon?

DAVID

(almost reverently)

Yeah. Every episode ever.

JENNIFER

(getting hysterical)

Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's

gonna like beeeee here!

DAVID

Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.

JENNIFER

Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any

STEREO!

DAVID

(breathless)

Oh my God ...

(sinking to his knees/

scooping up the remains)

Oh my God ...

JENNIFER

David, stop stressing, you can like--

turn it on normally ...

DAVID

No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It

doesn't work without a remote.

JENNIFER

Oh my God! He's here!

DICK VAN DYKE

TV repair.

JENNIFER

(beat)

TV repair?

DICK VAN DYKE

Yeah. TV busted?

JENNIFER

(pause ...)

Yeah ...

DICK VAN DYKE

(smiling wider)

Well here I am.

DICK VAN DYKE

(seeing the smashed remote)

Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little

disaster didn't ya fella.

DAVID

Yeah ... Sort of ...

DICK VAN DYKE

(setting down the toolbox)

We'll get you fixed up in no time.

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

I know how I'd feel if mine went out.

Almost like losing a friend.

DAVID

(tentatively)

You know, we didn't call any TV repair.

DICK VAN DYKE

Well that makes it a lucky day for both

of us, hunh?

JENNIFER

You think you could do this like soon?

It's almost six thirty.

DICK VAN DYKE

What's the rush?

DAVID

(cutting her off)

The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six

thirty.

DICK VAN DYKE

Pleasantville?

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for

years.

JENNIFER

That's not the reason. I've got a date

at six thirty.

DICK VAN DYKE

(ignoring her/

leaning closer to David)

Hey--who did Muff in take to the

masquerade ball when her date came down

with the measles?

DAVID

(stunned)

... Her father.

DICK VAN DYKE

Right. And how did she dress him?

DAVID

(still staring)

... Like Prince Charming.

DICK VAN DYKE

(studying David/

nodding)

Nice ... Nice ...

JENNIFER

Um--hello? I've got like a social

emergency here.

DICK VAN DYKE

(ignoring her)

Remember the one where Bud lost his

cousin when he was s'posed to be

watching him?

DAVID

Yeah ...

DICK VAN DYKE

What department store did they go to?

DAVID

McIntire's.

DICK VAN DYKE

McGinty's.

DAVID

No. McIntire's. Remember:

(sings)

"For the very best in men's attire,

Head right down to McIntire's."

DICK VAN DYKE

(stunned)

That's right.

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

Say--why don't you take this remote

instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph"

in it.

DAVID

Ooomph?

DICK VAN DYKE

Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you

want something that'll put you right in

the show.

JENNIFER

(quickly)

We'll take it.

DAVID

(beat)

How much does it cost?

DICK VAN DYKE

Oh--couldn't charge you for something

like that. It's free.

JENNIFER

Free?

DICK VAN DYKE

Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the

least I could do.

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

Well, I better get going. Your show's

almost on, and ...

(smiling at Jennifer)

It's almost time for your date.

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

(grinning)

Take care now.

DAVID

Hunh.

DAVID (CONT)

(relaxing)

Great.

JENNIFER

Lemme see that.

DAVID

No way.

BUD (OS)

(on TV)

Gee whizz, Mary Sue--why can't I borrow

your transistor radio?

MARY SUE (OS)

(on TV)

I promised Betty Jane she could use it

over the weekend.

JENNIFER

Do you mind. This is like the most

important moment of my whole life.

DAVID

Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for

this.

BUD (OS)

(on TV)

"But I told Mr. Miller I'd bring a

transistor in to electric shop."

MARY SUE (OS)

(on TV)

"And I told Betty Jean she could have it

for the picnic with Roy."

JENNIFER

(yanking at it)

God, David. Just give it to me!

DAVID

(yanking it back)

Get lost!

JENNIFER

YOU get lost!

DAVID

(a whisper)

Oh my God.

JENNIFER

What happened?

DAVID

I'm not sure.

GEORGE

(as if to his own children)

Hi Sport, hi Muffin ... Better get a

move on, you're gonna be late for school.

JENNIFER

(desperately)

What did you do?

DAVID

I don't know.

JENNIFER

(examining her black and white skin)

Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!

VOICE (OS)

Psst! Over here.

DICK VAN DYKE

(beaming)

Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you

thought I was just a fan or something.

JENNIFER

What happened?

DICK VAN DYKE

A miracle.

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

... See, every time I thought I'd found

someone they'd turn out to disappoint me.

They'd know the early episodes, but they

wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd

know all about Muffin but they wouldn't

know about Bud ...

DAVID

(to the TV set)

What the hell's going on!

DICK VAN DYKE

Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're

in ...

(smiles)

You know ...

BETTY (OS)

Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the

table.

DAVID

We're in Pleasantville?

DICK VAN DYKE

(grinning)

Dream come true, hunh?

JENNIFER

(panicking)

This isn't funny! I happen to have a

very important date in like five minutes!

DICK VAN DYKE

Well, you don't have to worry about that

anymore.

MARK DAVIS

(under his breath)

... Bitch.

JENNIFER

Noooooo!

DAVID

You--you gotta get us out of here.

DICK VAN DYKE

(recoiling slightly)

Why would I do that?

DAVID

Because we don't belong!

DICK VAN DYKE

Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's

Department store" ... "Their father

dressed as Prince Charming." That was

gorgeous Bud.

DAVID

My name's David.

JENNIFER

(wailing on the floor)

Oh GOD ...

DICK VAN DYKE

(a little snippy)

You know--this is a pretty strange way

of showing your appreciation.

DAVID

Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We

just--we want to go home now.

DICK VAN DYKE

(hurt)

But you don't know how long I've been

looking for someone like you.

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

I'm very disappointed ...

(deep breath)

In fact ... I'm starting to get a little

upset.

DAVID

Don't get upset.

DICK VAN DYKE

(snapping back)

Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone

for years ... You pour your heart into

it ... This is a privilege you know.

(shakes his head)

I don't think I better talk about this

right now.

DAVID

Where are you going ...

DICK VAN DYKE

I don't think we should discuss this

until I'm a little bit more composed.

DAVID

WAIT A MINUTE!!

DICK VAN DYKE

(turning his back)

Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so

emotional ...

DAVID

COME BACK!!!

DAVID (CONT)

(dropping the gizmo)

Oh God.

JENNIFER

What's going to happen?

DAVID

I don't know ... It's not possible ...

(looking at her)

Is it possible?

BETTY (OS)

Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is

getting cold.

DAVID

It can't be possible.

BETTY

Well, come on kids. You're not going off

to school without a hot breakfast inside

you ...

BETTY (CONT)

Forward march.

BETTY (CONT)

I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue.

It's so flattering.

JENNIFER

(dazed)

Thanks.

GEORGE

(once again)

Morning kids. Better get a move on or

you're going to be late for school.

DAVID

(under his breath)

I don't believe this.

JENNIFER

Neither do I.

GEORGE

Well, c'mon. Dig in.

BETTY

(to Jennifer)

I put blueberries in them just the way

you like.

JENNIFER

Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.

BETTY

(big smile)

Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to

start your day with a nice big breakfast.

BETTY (CONT)

(oppressively chipper)

Here. Why don't you have some waffle

cakes.

(beat)

And there's sausage and eggs and some

good crisp bacon ...

(beat)

... And a ham steak.

BETTY (CONT)

... And of course, a nice big bowl of

oatmeal.

CUT TO:

PAT BOONE

"... Tooty fruity--oh rooty. Tooty Fruity

... Oh rooty."

PAT BOONE (CONT)

"... Tooty fruity--oh rooty ..."

PAT BOONE (VO)

(slowly ...)

"... A wap bop a loo bop--a wap barn boom."

JENNIFER

I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.

DAVID

Just take deep breaths.

JENNIFER

All that animal fat. I feel it in my

pores or something.

JENNIFER (CONT)

I still don't see why we're doing this.

DAVID

We're supposed to be in school.

JENNIFER

We're supposed to be at home David! We're

supposed to be in color!

(wailing)

Oh God ...

MR. SIMPSON

Hello Bud.

DAVID

Hello Mr. Simpson.

MR. SIMPSON

Hear your Dad got a new car.

DAVID

Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.

JENNIFER

You know him?

DAVID

Owns the hardware store.

JENNIFER

Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know

what's going on but you'd better fix it!

I had a date with Mark Davis and I even

bought new UNDERWEAR!

DAVID

We just gotta play along for a little

while ... till that guy shows up again.

Then I'll talk to him and ...

JENNIFER

Play along?

DAVID

Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and

you're ... um--Mary Sue.

JENNIFER

(ripping the barette from her hair)

No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't

dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell

not going to do it for you!

DAVID

We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck

until he comes back.

JENNIFER

Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?

DAVID

To who?

FIREMAN

C'mere, kitty ...

JENNIFER

Oh God, we are. We're stuck in like

"Nerdville".

(shakes her head)

I always knew you'd pay a price for

this. I knew you couldn't be hopelessly

geekridden for this long without

suffering some like, really tragic

consequences.

(voice wavering)

... But it's just not fair. I mean--I'm

starting to get really--popular. Debbi

Russell transferred to another school

and my skin's been great since March and

Mark Davis is starting to come around

and ...

BOY'S VOICE (OS)

Hello Mary Sue.

BIFF (CONT)

What's all the commotion? Where's the

cat?

JENNIFER

Um ... It's ...

BIFF

Ah, right ...

(smiling at her again)

Well--guess I'll see ya later Mary Sue.

JENNIFER

Who's that?

DAVID

Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball

team.

JENNIFER

(still gaping)

Does he--you know--like "me"?

DAVID

As a matter of fact he does.

JENNIFER

(flicking her hair)

Hunh.

CUT TO:

JENNIFER

Those are my friends.

DAVID

Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.

JENNIFER

(staring at them)

Can we do any better?

DAVID

I don't think so.

LISA ANNE

(seeing her)

Mary Sue. You're gonna be late for

Geography.

JENNIFER

Okay ...

CUT TO:

MISS PETERS

Last week Class, we discussed the

geography of Main Street. This week,

we're going to be talking about Elm

Street. Can anyone tell me one of the

differences between Elm Street and Main

Street?

(pointing)

Tommy.

TOMMY

It's not as long?

MISS PETERS

That's right, Tommy. It's not as long.

Also, it only has houses. So the

geography of Main Street is different

than the geography of Elm Street.

MISS PETERS

Mary Sue.

JENNIFER

What's outside of Pleasantville?

MISS PETERS

What?

(beat)

I don't understand ...

JENNIFER

Outside of Pleasantville ... What's at

the end of Main Street?

MISS PETERS

Oh, Mary Sue. You should know the answer

to that. The end of Main Street is just

the beginning again.

CUT TO:

DAVID

Wow.

COACH

That's it men. Keep it up. Big game

tomorrow.

BIFF (OS)

Bud ...

BIFF

(a little nervous)

Hi ya Bud.

BUD

Hi ya Biff.

BIFF

Can I ask you a question?

BUD

Sure.

BIFF

Well ... If I was to ask your sister ...

What I mean is, if I was to go up to

Mary Sue ...

DAVID

Oh God! Are we in that episode?

BIFF

What?

DAVID

I don't believe it.

BIFF

What's the matter?

DAVID

You want to ask her out tonight, right?

And then you want to give her your

school pin ...

BIFF

Yeah ... How'd you know?

DAVID

(shaking his head)

Lucky guess.

(beat)

Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real

good time for that right now ...

DAVID (CONT)

What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a

little "different" lately ...

BIFF

(stunned)

She won't go out with me?

DAVID

I didn't say that. It's just that right

now ...

BIFF

I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't

go out with me ...

DAVID

(under his breath)

Look, I'm sure we'll work something out.

I'll talk to her or something.

DAVID (CONT)

Honest. It'll be fine.

CUT TO:

JENNIFER

No way.

DAVID

One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If

you don't go out with this guy we could

throw their whole universe out of whack.

JENNIFER

It's too weird David. This place is

giving me the creeps. Did you know all

the books are blank?

DAVID

What?

JENNIFER

I looked in the library. They got covers

with nothing inside them.

DAVID

What were you doing in a library?

JENNIFER

I got lost.

(beat)

Oh here ... look at this!

DAVID

JENNIFER!

JENNIFER

Just watch. You know why those guys just

get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing

burns around here, that's why! They

don't need any firemen ...

DAVID

Jen, listen ...

JENNIFER

(trembling)

I like--really need a cigarette, too.

DAVID

(putting his arm around her)

I'll get us out of here. I really will.

But if we don't play along we could

alter their whole existence. We may

never get home.

JENNIFER

You really think anybody's gonna, like,

notice if I don't have a chocolate malt

with this guy.

PEGGY JANE

(high-pitched--rapid fire)

You won't believe what we just heard.

LISA ANNE

Biff Martin's going to ask you out.

BETTY JEAN

And that's not all ...

PEGGY JANE

No, that's not all ...

ALL THREE TOGETHER

He's going to give you his pin!

JENNIFER

You sure I'm supposed to wear this?

JENNIFER

(looking in the mirror)

I could like kill a guy with these

things.

DAVID

It's in your closet.

JENNIFER

(examining her profile)

I've worn some kinky stuff before ...

DAVID

He won't notice anyway.

JENNIFER

What do you mean?

DAVID

They don't notice that kind of thing.

JENNIFER

So what's the point?

DAVID

Jen please ...

JENNIFER

He-llo? I've got like three pounds of

underwire here ...

DAVID

Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late

for work.

CUT TO:

MR. JOHNSON

(looking up)

Bud?

DAVID

Sorry ... I had to help my folks and

then I couldn't find my hat ...

MR. JOHNSON

Oh.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

I didn't know what to do.

DAVID

What's wrong?

MR. JOHNSON

Well--I always wipe down the counter and

then you set out the napkins and glasses

and then I make the french fries ...

DAVID

(confused)

Yeah ...

MR. JOHNSON

But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.

DAVID

I'm sorry.

DAVID (CONT)

(gently)

You know, if this ever happens again,

you can make the fries even if I haven't

put out the napkins yet.

MR. JOHNSON

I'm so glad you're here.

DAVID

I understand.

BIFF

Oh. Mary Sue ...

DAVID

(frazzled)

Peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two

orders of fries and a split?

TEEN AGE GIRL

Peppermint soda, two chocolate shakes,

order of fries, and we'll split it.

MR. JOHNSON

There aren't any cheeseburgers.

DAVID

(turning)

What?

MR. JOHNSON

Well, usually I put out the burger and

then you finish with the lettuce ...

DAVID

Listen to me!

DAVID (CONT)

Do you have the lettuce?

MR. JOHNSON

... Yeah.

DAVID

Have you cooked the burgers?

MR. JOHNSON

(quieter)

Yes.

DAVID

Well you can just put on the lettuce,

finish the burger and pretend it was me

doing it all along.

DAVID (CONT)

Really. It's fine.

BIFF

(haltingly)

I sure am glad you said you'd come out

with me tonight Mary Sue.

JENNIFER

(full blown "Mary Sue")

Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad

you asked me.

BIFF

I don't know if I ever said this to you

before, but, well ... I think you're

just about the keenest girl in the whole

school ...

JENNIFER

Really Biff? The keenest?

BIFF

Oh yeah.

JENNIFER

(all sarcasm)

Gosh. I hardly know what to say.

DAVID (OS)

What can I get you two?

BIFF

Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll have my

usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke.

JENNIFER

Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll just have a

salad and an Evian Water.

JENNIFER (CONT)

Cheeseburger it is.

BIFF

See the whole time we were in civics

together, I really wanted to sit next to

you--but you were always sitting between

Peggy Jane and Lisa Anne.

BIFF (CONT)

... And you always seemed so smart and

everything. Like that report you did on

"Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know

what I'd talk to you about.

JENNIFER

Well, sometimes talking's over-rated.

Don't you think?

BIFF

Hunh?

(goony laugh)

Oh, right ...

BIFF (CONT)

So I know I haven't been steady with

anybody, but I just don't want to rush

it. You don't want to make a mistake

with something that important.

JENNIFER

Oh, gosh no.

BIFF

I mean, there's kids that are even

holding hands already but I figure

there's plenty of time for that kind of

thing later on. Don't you?

JENNIFER

Oh you bet.

(beat)

Will you excuse me for a sec?

JENNIFER

Jesus Chirist ...

GIRL'S VOICES

(overlapping)

"Did he give it to you ... Did he give

it to you ... I bet he gave it to her

... Did he give it to you?"

JENNIFER

(straight ahead)

I don't think he knows how.

LISA ANNE

I bet he's gonna take her to Lover's

Lane.

PEGGY JANE

I bet he is. I bet he is.

BETTY JEAN

I bet he's even gonna hold her hand!

DAVID

(chipper)

Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry

cokes.

(pointedly)

If you need anything, I'll be right over

there.

JENNIFER

(Mary Sue)

Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly

need when we have each other?

BIFF

(befuddled)

Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over

and sit next to you in civics but ...

JENNIFER

You want to get out of here?

BIFF

What?

JENNIFER

You wanna get out of here? You wanna

leave?

BIFF

(confused)

But where would we go?

JENNIFER

(shrugging)

... Lover's Lane.

BIFF

(swallow)

Lover's Lane!

JENNIFER

Yeah. Lover's Lane. You up for it?

JENNIFER

C'mon. Let's go.

DAVID

NOOOOOO!

DAVID

YOU CAN'T DO THIS JENNIFER! HE DOESN'T

EXIST! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO SOMEONE WHO

DOESN'T EXIST!

DAVID (CONT)

(to God)

Thanks a lot.

CUT TO:

BIFF

Sure is pretty.

JENNIFER

(staring at him)

Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.

BIFF

To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think

you'd want to come here until we'd been

pinned for a little while.

JENNIFER

Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you

want to.

JENNIFER (CONT)

(breathy)

Or maybe I should just "pin" you.

BIFF

Oh, that's silly Mary Sue. How could you

possibly pin me?

CUT TO:

BETTY

Bud?

GEORGE

Son, what's wrong?

DAVID

Have you seen Mary Sue?

BETTY

Why no. She's still on her date with

Biff ... is something the matter?

DAVID

(still panting a little)

No, I ... I was just ... worried about

her.

GEORGE

(oppressively paternal)

Bud, your sister's a little older now

and she's naturally going to start going

out with boys.

(beat)

... In fact pretty soon--she's even

going to get married and make someone a

good little home-maker like your mother

here.

(smiles at Betty/

inside joke)

That's IF she can learn to bake.

BETTY

Oh, George ...

GEORGE

But your sister is a fine young woman

and she would never do anything for us

to be concerned about.

CUT TO:

BIFF

(some terror)

I think I better go home now Mary Sue ...

JENNIFER

(breathless)

... Why?

BIFF

(more terror)

I think ... I might be ill ...

BIFF (CONT)

(a whisper)

I think something's happening to me.

JENNIFER

It's s'posed to happen, Biff.

BIFF

It is?

JENNIFER

Trust me ...

CUT TO:

BETTY (OS)

Do you want some more cookies?

DAVID

(sick)

Oh no ... I'm fine.

BETTY

How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?

DAVID

I'm fine.

BETTY

Now who could that be.

DAVID

Oh hi!

MR. JOHNSON

Hi there. You took off so quick. I

wasn't sure if you were okay.

DAVID

Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ...

Had to get home early.

MR. JOHNSON

Bud ...

DAVID

Yeah ...

MR. JOHNSON

(sotto)

You know how when we close up, I close

the register, then you lower the shades,

then I turn out the lights, then we both

lock the doors.

DAVID

Yeah ...

MR. JOHNSON

(proud)

Well you weren't around this time so I

did the whole thing myself.

MR. JOHNSON

(more confidential)

Not only that, I didn't even do it in

the same order. First I lowered the

shades, then I closed the register.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

Oh, hello Betty.

BETTY

Hello Bill.

DAVID

(quickly)

Well, look, thanks for coming by. I ...

really appreciate it.

JENNIFER

Well gee thanks Biff. I had a really

wonderful time.

BIFF

... Me too.

JENNIFER

(sweetly)

Hello Mr. Johnson.

MR. JOHNSON

Oh, hello Mary Sue.

DAVID

(urgent whisper)

What did you do to him?

JENNIFER

(innocently)

Nothing.

DAVID

What do you mean "nothing?" That's not

nothing. That's ...

JENNIFER

Relax "Bud." We had a really nice time.

(mock YAWN)

... Now I'm really tired and we gotta

get up early for school in the morning

so ...

JENNIFER (CONT)

'Night.

CUT TO:

BETTY (OS)

Bud. It's 7:30 in the morning. Are you

watching television?

CUT TO:

DAVID

(quietly)

Oh no ...

COACH

Come on men. Let's go. Big game next

week.

DAVID

Oh my God ...

CUT TO:

DAVID

You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED

you.

JENNIFER

So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay.

They're like not good at basketball

anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.

DAVID

You don't understand. You're messing

with their UNIVERSE.

JENNIFER

Well maybe it needs to be messed with.

Did that ever like--occur to you?

(beat)

You know, they don't want to be like

this, it's just that nobody ever helped

them before.

PEGGY JANE

(walking past)

"MS". How you doin'?

JENNIFER

Kewl "PJ". How you doin'?

PEGGY JANE

(relishing her new word)

"Kewl."

DAVID

You have no right to do this.

JENNIFER

Well if I don't who will?

DAVID

They're happy like this.

JENNIFER

David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt

and a sweater set.

(pause ...)

You like all this don't you?

JENNIFER (CONT)

I mean, you don't think it's just like

dorky or funny or something ... you

really like it.

(shudders)

Oh God! I am just so personally

horrified right now ...

DAVID

I just don't think we have the right

to ...

JENNIFER

David, let me tell you something. These

people don't want to be geeks. They want

to be "attractive." They've got a lot of

potential, they just don't know any

better.

DAVID

They don't have that kind of potential.

JENNIFER

Um--hello? You want to like take a look?

BOY

Wow. What kind of gum is that?

JENNIFER

I gotta go. I'm meeting Biff at the

flagpole.

CUT TO:

DR. HENDERSON

Let me see it again.

DR. HENDERSON (CONT)

(examining it)

Well ... I don't think it's anything to

worry about ... It'll probably just

clear up by itself.

(to Lisa Anne)

Cut down on greasy foods and chocolate.

No french fries, that kind of thing.

(aside/

to the Mother)

It's just a "teenage" thing.

LIL RICHARD (VO)

"... Got a gal--her name is Sue. She

knows just what to do ..."

LIL RICHARD (OS)

"... A wop bop a loo bop--a wop bam

boom!"

DAVID

What'll it be?

BIFF

(still chipper as ever)

Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the

usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.

JENNIFER

Me too. Sounds swell.

DAVID

(pointed)

Really? It seems so fattening.

DAVID (CONT)

Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.

MR. JOHNSON

(staring straight ahead)

There aren't any cheeseburgers.

DAVID

(exasperated)

Look. I thought we talked about this, I

thought we said ...

MR. JOHNSON

Oh--what's the point, Bud?

DAVID

C'mere.

DAVID

What did you say?

MR. JOHNSON

Well ... I'm not sure I see the point

anymore.

DAVID

What are you talking about! You make

hamburgers! That is the point!

MR. JOHNSON

No I know ... I know I do ...

(he pauses, then looks up)

But it's always the same, you know?

Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the

cheese ... It never changes. It never

gets any better or worse ...

DAVID

Just listen to me ...

MR. JOHNSON

(not hearing him)

... Like the other night, when I closed

up by myself. That was different ...

DAVID

Forget about that!

MR. JOHNSON

Oh ... Okay.

(beat/

lower)

... But I really liked it.

DAVID

Look, you can't always like what you do.

Sometimes you just do it because it's

your job. And even if you don't like it,

you just gotta do it anyway.

MR. JOHNSON

Why?

DAVID

(exasperated)

So they can have their hamburgers!

MR. JOHNSON

(like a secret)

You know what I really like?

DAVID

(warily)

... What's that?

MR. JOHNSON

Christmastime.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

See every year on Dec 3, I get to paint

the Christmas decorations in the window.

And every year, I get to paint a

different thing ...

(beat)

One year it's the North Pole. The next

I do Santa's workshop. Here I'll show

you.

DAVID

(impressed)

Wow ... That's pretty good ...

MR. JOHNSON

Thanks.

(continuing)

But this morning I was thinking about

it and I realized that I looked forward

to it all year. And then I thought "Gee.

That seems awfully silly. That seems

like an awfully long time to be waiting

for just one moment, don't you think?"

MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

Well don't you?

DAVID

I think you should try not to think

about this anymore.

MR. JOHNSON

Really?

DAVID

Yeah.

MR. JOHNSON

Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.

CUT TO:

GUS

Have they ever lost before?

GEORGE

Basketball? No they sure haven't.

BOB

Just feels "wrong", that's all.

THIRD PATRON

Maybe that's where they get that saying,

"can't win 'em all."

GUS

Yeah. That's a good point, Ralph. They

do have that saying.

BOB

But they do win 'em all, Gus. They've

always won 'em all.

GUS

Well, yeah. That's true too.

CUT TO:

MARGE

(dealing the cards)

... He said it would clear up on its

own if she just stayed away from fried

foods and sweets ...

BETTY

Well that makes sense.

MARGE

Except it's spread to her lips now too.

Oh, I don't know.

MARY

(a THIRD WOMAN)

And you say it's just "red?"

MARGE

Well--like red, only ... "redder."

MARY

Hunh. I know what you mean. That's like

the front of Bill Johnson's shop. I was

going by it the other day and it looked

green only "greener."

MARGE

(lowering her voice)

Have you seen him lately? The man

doesn't look like himself. I was

getting my sewing machine fixed across

the street and he was sitting in the

window of his shop just staring.

Wasn't looking at anything in

particular--just staring off into space.

MARY

That is strange.

MARGE

Betty, it's your bid.

BETTY

Uh ... Seven hearts.

CUT TO:

BETTY

Mary Sue?

JENNIFER

Yeah?

BETTY

Can I ask you a question?

JENNIFER

Sure.

BETTY

What goes on up at Lover's Lane?

JENNIFER

(turning toward her)

What do you mean?

BETTY

Well, you hear all these things lately.

You know--kids spending so much time up

there ...

(she looks over)

Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?

JENNIFER

Yeah ...

(beat)

That--and ...

BETTY

What?

JENNIFER

It doesn't matter.

BETTY

No. I want to know.

JENNIFER

(glances toward the living room/

lowers her voice)

... Sex.

BETTY

Ah.

BETTY (CONT)

What's sex?

JENNIFER

You sure you want to know this?

BETTY

Yes.

JENNIFER

Okay.

JENNIFER (CONT)

You see Mom ...

(softer and with understanding)

When two people like each other very

much ...

DISSOLVE TO:

JENNIFER

You okay?

BETTY

Yes ...

(softly)

It's just that ...

JENNIFER

(gently)

What?

BETTY

Well ...

(looking up)

... Your father would never do anything

like that.

JENNIFER

(leaning forward)

Oh. Hmm ...

(whisper/

woman to woman)

Well, Mom ... there's ways to "enjoy"

yourself without Dad.

CUT TO:

GEORGE

Sweetie? You coming to bed?

GEORGE (CONT)

Betty?

BETTY

(calling out)

Yeah ... I'm just going to take a bath

first.

DAVID

Oh my God!

DAVID

Jesus Christ ...

DAVID

FIRE! FIRE!

DAVID

(entering)

FIRE ... FIRE ...

DAVID (CONT)

(beat)

CAT!!!

DAVID

Right here!

FIRE CHIEF

Where is it?

DAVID

Here! Grab this nozzle.

FIREMAN

But where's the ...

DAVID

Just grab it!

DAVID (CONT)

(shouting)

Okay! Now point this right at the

flames--like this.

FIREMAN

Whoa!

(beat)

So that's what these do.

BOB (VO)

(fading in)

... In honor and in recognition of

your heroism ...

DISSOLVE TO:

BOB

... And with great appreciation from

the citizens of Pleasantville ...

BOB

I am pleased to present You with this

special commendation, from the

Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce!

CUT TO:

GIRL'S VOICE

Hi Bud ...

MARGARET

That was sure swell ...

DAVID

Oh. Thanks, Margaret.

MARGARET

(smiling)

I baked you my oatmeal cookies.

DAVID

(vaguely remembering an episode)

Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.

MARGARET

No. I baked them for you.

DAVID

No. You baked them for Whitey.

MARGARET

(low and gutteral)

No. I baked them for you.

DAVID

Um ... thanks.

MARGARET

See ya.

CUT TO:

JENNIFER

(in a whisper)

I had nothing to do with that fire.

DAVID

(quietly)

It's okay.

JENNIFER

Not directly anyhow ...

DAVID

It's fine.

JENNIFER

(still under her breath)

Um ... They like wanna ask you a

question ... I didn't know how to

handle it. So ...

DAVID

Sure.

DAVID (CONT)

How you doin?

VARIOUS KIDS

Swell ...

BOY

How'd you know about the fire?

DAVID

What?

BOY

How'd you know how to put it out and

all?

DAVID

Well--where I used to live ...

That's just what firemen did.

BOY

And where's that?

DAVID

(carefully)

Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.

BOY

What's outside of Pleasantville?

DAVID

Look it doesn't matter. It's not

important.

BOY

What is it?

DAVID

It's really not important.

GIRL'S VOICE (OS)

What's outside of Pleasantville?

MARGARET (CONT)

(hungry for knowledge)

C'mon. Tell us ...

DAVID

(slowly)

Well ... There are some places where

the road doesn't go in a circle.

There are some places where it keeps

on going.

MARGARET

(an exotic concept)

Keeps going ...

DAVID

Well--it all just keeps going.

Roads ... rivers ...

2ND BOY

(from the back)

Like the "Mighty Mississippi".

DAVID

... What?

BOY

(quoting)

"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin'

an' goin' as far you could see."

DAVID

(turning to Jennifer)

I thought the books were blank?

JENNIFER

They were.

JENNIFER (CONT)

(quickly)

Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault.

They asked me what it was about and I

like didn't remember 'cause we had it

back in tenth grade, But I told them

what I DID remember, and the next

thing I knew the pages had filled in.

DAVID

The pages filled in?

JENNIFER

But like only up to the part about

the raft, because I didn't read any

farther.

2ND BOY

Do you know how it ends?

DAVID

(hesitating)

Well, yeah ... I do.

MARGARET

(breathless)

So how does it end?

DAVID

Well--see ... they're both running

away--Huck and the slave ... And ...

They go up the river ... But--in

trying to get free they sort of see

that they're free already.

DAVID (CONT)

(quietly)

Oh my God.

2ND BOY

Wow!

3RD BOY

Do you know this one?

DAVID

Hunh?

(looks down at the book)

Oh yeah ... Well this is great.

(beat)

See--Holden Caulfield is like this

really lonely kid...

GUS

I don't know Phil. It's pretty strange.

PHIL

I'll say it's strange. Gettin' stranger.

PHIL (CONT)

I mean goin' up to that lake all the

time is one thing, but now they're

going to a library! I mean what's next?

BURT

Oughtta be havin' an ice cream soda.

That's where they oughtta be.

GEORGE

Want some bridge mix?

BOB

Oh, no thanks ...

GEORGE

Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...

BOB

I'm fine--but thank you.

BOB (CONT)

George, you're probably wondering why

I asked if I could come over today ...

BOB (CONT)

I'm sure you've noticed the same

things we all have--certain "changes"

going on in the town.

(beat)

You know what I mean by "changes"?

GEORGE

"Changes."

BOB

(nodding)

"Changes."

(takes a belt of martini)

And it's not just the fire or big

stuff like that. It's little things.

(beat)

Did you hear about Bill Miller?

GEORGE

(concerned)

No. What?

BOB

Wife wants him to get one of those

new beds.

GEORGE

One of those ... big beds?

GEORGE (CONT)

Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?

BOB

I really don't know.

(beat)

Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a

boxboy at the market.

GEORGE

... How?

BIG BOB

Said he didn't want to do it anymore.

Just took off his apron in the middle

of an order. Mrs. Thompson had her

groceries spread all over the counter

... Took 'em four hours to sort the

whole thing out.

GEORGE

Holy cow.

BIG BOB

George, everyone likes you.

GEORGE

Oh well ...

BOB

No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause

you're a great bowler ... They respect

you ...

GEORGE

(heartfelt)

Thank you very much.

BOB

And it's important for them to see

someone they respect, stand up for

what's right. If you love a place,

you can't sit around and watch this

kind of thing happen to it.

GEORGE

No. Of course not.

BOB

(big patriarchal smile)

And that's why I want you to be on

the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.

GEORGE

(stunned/

moved)

Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.

BOB

(smiling)

Why don't you start by saying "yes,"

and then getting me one of those swell

pineapple kabobs.

GEORGE

Oh sure ... You bet.

(calling out)

Betty ...

GEORGE (CONT)

(louder this time)

BETTY ...

GEORGE (CONT)

BETTY--BOB WANTS TO TRY ONE OF YOUR

GREAT HORS D'OEUVRES ...

DAVID

I'll get her.

DAVID

(approaching slowly)

Are you okay?

DAVID (CONT)

Are you alright?

BETTY

(fighting tears)

What am I going to do?

DAVID

It's okay. It's alright.

BETTY

(trembling)

I can't go out there. How can I go out

there?

BETTY (CONT)

(quieter)

Look at me ...

DAVID

Have you got any make up?

BETTY

In my handbag.

DAVID

Okay--first we'll dry you out a little.

BETTY

(off his reaction)

What?

BETTY (CONT)

(beat)

Does it look okay?

DAVID

Looks just like it did.

BETTY

And they won't be able to tell?

DAVID

(even quieter)

No ... They won't be able to tell.

DAVID (CONT)

Wait.

BETTY

(turning back)

What?

DAVID

It's fine.

BETTY

Thank you.

DAVID

(sadly)

Sure.

CUT TO:

MR. JOHNSON

Oh, hi.

DAVID

(entering)

Hi.

MR. JOHNSON

Aren't you a little early?

DAVID

(quietly)

I brought you something ... From the

library.

DAVID

It's an art book.

MR. JOHNSON

Oh my Gosh, Bud ...

DAVID

Open it.

DAVID (CONT)

I just thought since you liked

painting it might help to ...

MR. JOHNSON (OS)

Mmmmgh ...

MR. JOHNSON

It's beautiful, Bud ...

DAVID

What's wrong?

MR. JOHNSON

I'll never be able to do that.

DAVID

Oh, well--you're just starting out.

I mean, you can't do it ...

MR. JOHNSON

No, that's not it.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

Where am I going to see colors like

that?

MR. JOHNSON

Must be awfully lucky to see colors

like that. I bet they don't even know

how lucky they are.

DAVID

Hi.

MARGARET

(turning/

lighting up)

Oh ... Hi.

DAVID

(pause)

Look, I probably shouldn't be asking

you this--not knowing you that well

and all ...

DAVID (CONT)

It's just that my folks are gonna

stay home and they said I could use

their car.

(moment of truth/

abandoning his speech)

... You want to go out with me

tonight?

MARGARET

(breathless)

Sure ... Where would we go?

DAVID

(swallows)

... Lover's Lane?

CUT TO:

DAVID

(calling back)

Sorry ...

DAVID

"Oh when the Saints ... Go Marching

in ..."

MAN'S VOICE (OS)

Bud ...

MAN'S VOICE (CONT)

David ...

DICK VAN DYKE

Hello there.

DAVID

(wary)

... Hi.

DICK VAN DYKE

(stage whisper)

Well c'mere, young fella.

DICK VAN DYKE

(big smile)

You know I've been thinkin' ... I

might have been a little "hasty"

the other day when you asked to come

home--just took me by such surprise,

ya know--ha ha ...

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

So even though I can't make any

promises, well--I figured if you

asked me real nice--I might just be

willing to talk about it again.

DAVID

(quickly)

I can't.

DICK VAN DYKE

What?

DAVID

Talk about it. Right now, I mean.

I got to ... um ...

DICK VAN DYKE

Bud--I thought you wanted to come

home.

DAVID

Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I

told my "dad" I'd clean out the

rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted

me to ... to change the tape in the

register ...

DICK VAN DYKE

(getting testy)

I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm

getting sorta concerned about what

I'm seeing in some of these

re-runs ...

DAVID

Re-runs?

DICK VAN DYKE

Like when Margaret Henderson makes

her cookies for Whitey.

(losing it a little)

... Those aren't your cookies Bud.

DAVID

Oh, I know they're not. But I mean--

they're just "cookies" after all ...

DICK VAN DYKE

Excuse me?

DAVID

Well they're not just cookies. I

mean, they're great cookies ...

Look, I'd love to get into this

whole thing but I'm really running

late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?

DICK VAN DYKE

BUD.

DAVID

Terrific. I'll talk to you then.

JENNIFER

What's wrong?

DAVID

Nothing.

JENNIFER

Nothing?

DAVID

Listen ...

DAVID (CONT)

You're reading?

JENNIFER

(glancing at the book)

Yeah. Can't believe you started such

a dorky fad.

JENNIFER (CONT)

D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?

DAVID

(amazed)

... Yeah.

JENNIFER

Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35

pages.

DAVID

(still stunned)

That's great.

JENNIFER

So what is it?

DAVID

Well ... I just ...

(out of the blue)

Can I ask you a question?

JENNIFER

Sure.

DAVID

Remember when you told me that Lisa

Rosenberg liked me?

JENNIFER

Yeah ...

DAVID

Well--did she really like me or were

you just making that up.

JENNIFER

No. She really liked you.

DAVID

You weren't playing a joke? She

woulda gone out with me?

JENNIFER

Gone out with you. She woulda like

rearranged your tonsils.

DAVID

Wow.

JENNIFER

Can I ask you a question?

DAVID

Yes.

JENNIFER

How come I'm still in black and white?

DAVID

(back to earth)

What?

JENNIFER

Well I've had like ten times as

much sex as these girls and I'm

still like this. They have one hour

in the back of a car and suddenly

they're in technicolor.

DAVID

Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...

(thinks)

... it's not just the sex ...

JENNIFER

(looking up quickly)

What?

JENNIFER (CONT)

No, it's not just the sex, is it?

CUT TO:

MARGARET

Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.

DAVID

Oh ... Right.

DAVID

Wow.

SAM COOKE (VO)

(over the car radios)

"Cupid, draw back your bow ..."

DAVID

What's that smell?

MARGARET

Aren't these great?

MR. JOHNSON (OS)

We're closed right now ...

MR. JOHNSON

Oh, hi ...

BETTY

(turning to leave)

I'm sorry ...

MR. JOHNSON

No, no ... Come on in.

BETTY

I just thought ... It's beautiful.

MR. JOHNSON

Thanks.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

I was just trying to do one of these

"still lifes."

MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

Having kind of a tough time.

BETTY

I think it looks nice.

MR. JOHNSON

Well ...

(shrugs)

Here's what it's s'posed to look like.

BETTY

Oh my ...

MR. JOHNSON

Here. Look at this.

BETTY

(breathless)

Where'd you get this?

MR. JOHNSON

Bud brought it to me.

BETTY

Bud?

MR. JOHNSON

Here's my favorite.

MR. JOHNSON

What do you think?

MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

Isn't it great how she's resting like

that?

BETTY

(faintly)

She's crying.

MR. JOHNSON

What?

BETTY

She's crying.

MR. JOHNSON

No she's not.

BETTY

Yes she is.

MR. JOHNSON

(following her)

Wait ...

BETTY

I've got to go ...

MR. JOHNSON

It's alright.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

It's alright. Let me see.

BETTY

(shame)

No ...

MR. JOHNSON

It's beautiful.

MR. JOHNSON

(a whisper)

... It's beautiful.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

You shouldn't cover that up.

CUT TO:

JENNIFER

(impressed)

Hunh.

BIFF

Mary Sue--C'mon ...

JENNIFER

(leaning out the window)

What are you doing?

BIFF

(jiggling in anticipation)

It's six-thirty ...

JENNIFER

So.

BIFF

We were gonna ... You know ...

JENNIFER

Oh.

(remembering)

I can't.

BIFF

Why not?

JENNIFER

I'm busy.

BIFF

(surprised)

With what?

JENNIFER

(turning to Biff)

I'm studying.

CUT TO:

DAVID

(inhaling)

Mmmmgh.

MARGARET

Do they have those ... Where you come

from?

DAVID

Yeah ... I guess.

(beat)

I don't know.

MARGARET

You don't know?

MARGARET (CONT)

So what's it like?

DAVID

What?

MARGARET

(a whisper)

Out there.

DAVID

Oh. don't know ... It's different.

MARGARET

How?

DAVID

Well it's louder ... And scarier I

guess ... And ... and a lot more

dangerous ...

MARGARET

Sounds fantastic. You know some kids

came up here the other night to go

swimming--took off all their clothes.

MARGARET (CONT)

Do they have an Ocean? I've heard

about the ocean.

DAVID

Yeah.

MARGARET

What's that like?

DAVID

Well it's big. And it's blue ...

(as if realizing it for the first time)

... It's really really blue.

MARGARET

Mmmm.

(beat)

Boy. It's hot up here.

MARGARET (CONT)

You want some berries?

DAVID

Hunh?

MARGARET

I picked them myself. They grow wild

up here.

(eating one)

Mmm. So sweet.

DAVID

(looking at them)

They just grow like that?

MARGARET

(looking straight up)

Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff.

Currants and strawberries ... Here.

I'll show you.

MARGARET (CONT)

Here.

MARGARET

Go on. Try it.

CUT TO:

GEORGE

Honey--I'm home.

GEORGE (CONT)

Honey--I'm home ...

CUT TO:

BETTY

(frightened)

What is that?

MR. JOHNSON

I don't know.

CUT TO:

MARGARET

What is that?

MARGARET

What's going on?

DAVID

Rain.

MARGARET

Real rain?

DAVID

Yeah ... You don't have rain either?

DAVID (CONT)

Right. Of course you don't ...

MARGARET

What do we do?

DAVID

(reaching the car)

We'll just put up the top.

MARGARET

What top?

DAVID

It's fine. Come on.

DAVID (CONT)

It's alright. There's nothing to be

afraid of.

CUT TO:

JENNIFER

Cool ...

GEORGE

(a little frightened/

a little petulant)

Honey, I'm home ...

GEORGE (CONT)

(baffled)

Where's my dinner?

GEORGE

Where's my dinner ...

GEORGE

(insistent)

Where's my DINNER ...

GEORGE

Where's my DINNER!

GEORGE

(over the storm)

WHERE'S MY DINNER ...

GEORGE

... WHERE'S MY DINNER! WHERE'S MY

DINNER!

GEORGE

(plaintively)

Where's my dinner?

BOB

What happened?

BOB

Are you alright?

(looking at him)

What is it?

GEORGE

(faintly)

Rain.

BOB

(beat)

Real rain?

BOB (CONT)

Oh my God ...

BOB (CONT)

... We had no idea. Burt was rolling

a 250 and ...

(beat)

Are you alright?

BOB (CONT)

What happened?

GEORGE

(still shivering)

Well, I ... I came home like I always

do, And I came in the front door. And

I took off my coat. And I put down my

briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."

GEORGE

... Only no one was there.

GEORGE (CONT)

So I went into the kitchen and I

yelled it again. "Honey--I'm home."

But there was no one there either.

No wife. No lights. No dinner.

GEORGE (CONT)

So I went to the oven--you know--

because I thought maybe she had made

me one of those "TV dinners ..."

GEORGE (CONT)

But she hadn't. She was gone.

BOB

(gently/

the patriarch)

... It's gonna be fine George.

GUS

What do we do Bob?

BOB

Well--we'll be safe for now--thank

goodness we're in a bowling alley--

but if George here doesn't get his

dinner, any one of us could be next.

It could be you Gus, or you Burt, or

even you Phil ...

BOB (CONT)

(like a WWII movie)

... That's real rain out there

gentlemen. This isn't some little

"virus" that's going to "clear up on

it's own." There's something

happening to our town and I think we

can all see where it comes from.

BOB (CONT)

We're gonna need a town meeting.

Phil, how fast can you turn around

a leaflet in your print shop?

PHIL

Couple of hours.

BOB

Gus, why don't you get a bunch of

kids from the basketball team to help

you put them up on lamposts and tree

trunks ...

BOB (CONT)

(soothingly)

And the first thing you're gonna do

is get a cup of hot cocoa and a nice

dry bowling shirt.

MR. JOHNSON

You can't go out there.

BETTY

But I really should get home.

MR. JOHNSON

But you can't go out there.

BETTY

Sounds nice ... Once you get used

to it.

MR. JOHNSON

(listening)

Yeah. It does.

BETTY

Like a drum.

MR. JOHNSON

Yeah.

(thinks)

Or like sprinklers in the summer ...

CUT TO:

MR. JOHNSON

(seeing the rainbow)

Oh my Gosh ...

MARGARET

(awed)

Oh my God ...

JENNIFER

(looking at the rainbow)

Oh my God ...

BOB

(horrified)

Oh my GOD!

CUT TO:

BETTY

I told you where I was.

GEORGE

All night?

BETTY

I got caught in the storm. You were

gone all night too.

GEORGE

(the ultimate defense)

I was in a bowling-alley.

GEORGE (CONT)

(sudden smile)

Look. Let's just forget about it.

Let's just go to the meeting and ...

BETTY

I told you, George. I'm not going.

GEORGE

(bigger smile)

Sure you are.

BETTY

No I'm not.

BETTY (CONT)

Look at me George. That meeting's not

for me. Look at my face.

GEORGE

It's fine. You'll put on some make up

and ...

BETTY

I don't want to put on some make up ...

GEORGE

(protesting)

It goes away ... It'll go away.

BETTY

(gently)

I don't want it to go away.

GEORGE

(the '50s patriarch)

Okay--now you listen to me ...

(beat)

You're gonna come to this meeting and

you're gonna put on this make up, and

you're gonna come home at six o'clock

every night and have dinner ready on

this table.

BETTY

(softly)

No I'm not sweetie.

BETTY (CONT)

(half whisper)

... There's a meatloaf in the fridge.

You just put it in the oven and turn

this little knob up to three-fifty.

If you put the pie in forty minutes

later, it'll be hot in time for

dessert.

BETTY (CONT)

I made a couple of lunches for you

and put them in brown paper bags ...

(much quieter)

I'm gonna go now.

GEORGE

Where are you gonna go?

BETTY

I'm gonna go now.

GEORGE

Betty, don't go out there like that!

They'll see you!

(beat)

They'll SEE you!

GEORGE (CONT)

Betty, come back here!

BOB

This was found over in Dave Murphy's

trash can. There were four of them

like this ...

BOB

Jane Davidson found these in her

son's laundry basket.

BOB (CONT)

This is from Mary Petersen's front

porch. She found one last week.

There were two more this morning ...

CUT TO:

DAVID

(softly)

I got you something.

MARGARET

It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?

DAVID

It was a prop for the school play ...

MARGARET

Can I open it?

DAVID

Sure ...

DRIVER

Hello Bud ...

DAVID

(clipped)

Hello Whitey.

WHITEY

(more pointed)

Hello Margaret.

MARGARET

Hello Whitey ...

WHITEY

(loud)

Hey Bud, how come you're not at

the town meeting right now?

DAVID

(curt)

No reason.

(pause/

firing back)

How come you're not?

WHITEY

Oh. We're s'posed to go out and

let everybody know about it. See.

WHITEY (CONT)

No reason hunh ... See I thought

maybe it was cause you were too

busy entertaining your colored

girlfriend.

DAVID

Why don't you guys just get the

hell out of here.

WHITEY

Oh, okay, Bud. We'll do that.

WHITEY (CONT)

(leering more)

You know Margaret, you can come

over and bake those Oatmeal cookies

for me anytime you want to.

DAVID

It's fine ... It doesn't mean anything.

CUT TO:

WOMAN

Ed McFadden's got a blue front door.

ED MCFADDEN

It's always been blue!

WOMAN

Not that blue!

MAN

There's a big tree turning orange

in Joe Baker's front yard!

BOB

People, people ... I think we all

know what's going on here.

BOB

Obviously certain "changes" have

been happening. Up until now, things

in Pleasantville have always been--

well ... "Pleasant." And, recently,

certain things have become ...

"Un-Pleasant." Now it seems to me

the first thing we have to do is to

separate out the things that are

pleasant, from the things that are

"Un-Pleasant."

BOB (CONT)

George, why don't you and Burt

take the lead on this. Why don't

you put together kind of an

"Un-Pleasant" Activities Committee ...

DICK VAN DYKE (OS)

Bud ...

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

I want a word with you ...

DAVID

(scared)

Oh--well ...

DICK VAN DYKE

(BOOMING)

NOW!

DICK VAN DYKE

(still pretty loud)

What the hell do you think you're

doing!

DAVID

(terrified)

What do you mean?

DICK VAN DYKE

What do I MEAN!

(beat)

You think this is a toy? You think

it's your own little goddamn

coloring book ...

DAVID

Look--it just sort of "happened" ...

DICK VAN DYKE

A deluge doesn't just "happen."

Bolts of lightning don't just

"happen" ...

(louder)

You burned down an ELM tree for

Christ's sake ...

DAVID

I had nothing to do with that.

DICK VAN DYKE

Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory.

What episode does the orgy happen

in, again?

DAVID

Look ...

DICK VAN DYKE

It was a gift Bud. It was so

special. You liked these things

as much as I did, remember:

Warm smells in the family kitchen?

A smile from a stranger? You know

how rare that is?

DAVID

(beat/

quietly)

... Only if they mean it.

DICK VAN DYKE

OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING

TO PISS ME OFF!

DAVID

(finding courage)

I didn't do anything wrong.

DICK VAN DYKE

Oh no? Let me show you something!

DICK VAN DYKE

"YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS PLACE."

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

YOU DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE IN THIS

PARADISE!

DICK VAN DYKE

(quickly)

Where's the remote control I gave

you?

DAVID

Why?

DICK VAN DYKE

Because you're coming home. I'm

gonna put this place back the way

it was.

DAVID

No you're not.

DICK VAN DYKE

EXCUSE ME?

DAVID

(gathering strength)

I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.

DICK VAN DYKE

(nuts)

JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

OW!

DAVID

(terrified)

I'm going to leave now.

DICK VAN DYKE

You're not going anywhere. You're

gonna get that remote and you're

gonna come home and we're gonna

make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

Don't make me get rough with you!

I can get awfully fucking rough!

DAVID

(as scared as she is)

Come on!

DAVID (CONT)

COME ON!

DAVID

Get out of here!

DAVID

Are you alright?

DAVID (CONT)

(off her look)

What?

DAVID

(quietly)

Come on.

CUT TO:

DAVID

Oh my God.

DAVID (CONT)

Are you alright? Are you okay?

BETTY

(taking his arm)

No. Let's get out of here.

CUT TO:

DAVID

We should be okay up here.

DAVID

(a whisper)

We better go.

MARGARET

Where are they?

DAVID

I'm not sure.

DAVID

Oh my God.

JENNIFER

Don't! Just let go.

BIFF

It's better, Mary Sue.

JENNIFER

I said, NO!

(yanking it)

... I've read like one book in my

whole life and I'll be damned if I

let you throw it on that fire ...

DAVID

(a whisper)

It's okay. It's me.

CUT TO:

DAVID

Let's go inside.

DAVID

Hello?

MR. JOHNSON

Just thought I'd try to tidy it up

a bit.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT)

It's okay. Once we sweep it up it'll

be alright again ...

DAVID

Well he's right. Come on. Let's turn

these booths back up. "Mary Sue",

why don't you help me slide this in

front of the door. We'll be okay in

here.

CUT TO:

BOB

This is not the answer people.

BOB (CONT)

No matter how upset we may get, or

how frustrated we may be, we're

not gonna solve our problems out

in the street. It's just the wrong

way to do it. We have to have a

"Code of Conduct" we can all agree

to live by.

BOB (CONT)

Now, I asked George and Burt here

to sketch out some ideas-and I

think they've done a terrific job.

(beat/

scans the crowd)

If we all agree on these then we

can take a vote and I think we'll

start to move in the right direction.

BOB

(reading from the

CODE OF CONDUCT")

"ONE: All public disruption and

acts of vandalism are to cease

immediately."

BOB

"TWO: All citizens of Pleasantville

are to treat one another in a

courteous and "pleasant" manner ..."

LISA ANNE

"Courteous and Pleasant manner."

That doesn't sound too bad.

DAVID

(reading from THE CODE)

"THREE: The area commonly known as

Lover's Lane as well as the

Pleasantville Public Library shall

be closed until further notice."

DAVID (CONT)

"FOUR: The only permissible

recorded music shall be the

following: Pat Boone, Johnny

Mathis, Perry Como, Jack Jones,

The marches of John Phillips

Souza or the Star Spangled

Banner. In no event shall any

music be tolerated that is not of

a temperate or "pleasant" nature."

VARIOUS KIDS

(overlapping)

"Oh my gosh ... No ..."

DAVID

"FIVE: There shall be no public

sale of umbrellas or preparation

for inclement weather of any kind."

DAVID (CONT)

"SIX: No bedframe or mattress may

be sold measuring more than 38

inches wide."

(pause)

"SEVEN: The only permissible exterior

paint colors shall be BLACK, WHITE or

GRAY, despite the recent availability

of certain alternatives."

DAVID (CONT)

"EIGHT: All elementary and high

school curriculums shall teach the

"non-changist" view of history--

emphasizing "continuity" over

"alteration."

(David pauses)

Wow.

BOY

Hey. This thing works.

BUDDY HOLLY

Well all the things that you say

and do Make me want to be with

you-oo-oo ...

LISA ANNE

(suddenly/

in a panic)

Turn that off!

LISA ANNE (CONT)

(shrieking)

You're not allowed to do that now!

DAVID

Sure you are.

BUDDY HOLLY

The little things that you say and do

Make we want to be with you-oo-oo ...

RAVE ON! It's a crazy feeling ...

RAVE ON! It's got me reelin' ...

DAVID

(whisper)

Stick together till you get off

Main Street.

DISSOLVE TO:

DAVID

It's okay. We'll get you a new one.

MR. JOHNSON

(softly)

I don't know what I'd do if I

couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just

don't know what I'd do ...

DAVID

Maybe I have an idea.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BOB

(bellowing)

Did you do this?

DAVID

(quietly but clearly)

Yes I did.

BOB

Do you know that it's illegal?

DAVID

(thinks)

Yes I do.

BOB

BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

DAVID

Because anybody should be able to

paint in whatever color they want.

BOB

You're not allowed to do this! I

could arrest you for this.

DAVID

Still doesn't make it right.

BOB

Dan! Arrest them!

DAN (POLICE CHIEF)

(quietly)

Um ... I don't know how to do that,

Bob.

BOB

What do you mean!?

DAN

Well, I never had to do it before.

BOB

You put handcuffs on them and you

take them to the police station.

DAN

(thinks)

Oh. guess I could do that, then.

DAVID

(suddenly stronger)

C'mere, Dan. I'll help you.

CUT TO:

DAN

There's someone to see you Bud.

DAVID

I thought it might be you.

DICK VAN DYKE

Hope you're proud of yourself.

DAVID

I am actually ... Glad to see you've

finally shown your true colors.

DICK VAN DYKE

Okay, let's cut the shit and get

right to it. Where's that remote

control?

DAVID

Why?

DICK VAN DYKE

Because you're coming home.

DAVID

(smiles)

Why don't you just take me back

without it?

DICK VAN DYKE

Oh. You're a smart little bastard

aren't you?

(tightly)

It's kind of like a restricted

ticket. You gotta leave the same

way you came.

DAVID

So ... I guess as long as I'm

here, all sorts of things could

happen to this place. We could

have pink lawns and blue trees ...

DICK VAN DYKE

Just gimme the damn remote!

DAVID

I'm sorry. I can't do that.

DICK VAN DYKE

I don't know what went wrong.

You answered every question. You

knew every detail. The senior

Prom ... McIntire's Department

Store. We had all the same warm

memories: Sock hops. The Church

Social ...

DAVID

They weren't my memories.

(beat)

I borrowed them. It's no good when

you borrow them.

DICK VAN DYKE

(containing his rage)

How long do you think you've been

here?

DAVID

(warily)

I don't know ... Three, four weeks.

DICK VAN DYKE

Much less than that.

(checks his watch)

An hour and a half.

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

See--and this is really great--

the show was on for what--half an

hour a week? So that means for

every week that goes by in

Pleasantville, only half an hour

goes by in the real world.

DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)

Now Buddy, you're going on trial

tomorrow. And if they find you

guilty, you're gonna be stuck here

forever. Well, not forever--lemme

think ...

(calculates)

Five year sentence ... Carry the

three ... That comes out to ...

sixteen and a half centuries, and

that's rounding down.

DAVID

I'm going on trial tomorrow?

DICK VAN DYKE

This is TV pal. They don't fool

around.

DAVID

(stoicly)

There's worse places.

DICK VAN DYKE

Oh sure. For the first hundred

years. Then it starts to get a

little monotonous.

(beat)

Sleep well.

CUT TO:

BOB

Bud Parker and William Johnson,

you have been charged with

desecration of a public building

and the intentional use of

prohibited paint colors in

violation of the Pleasantville

Code of Conduct and laws of

common decency. Do you admit that

on the night of May 1, you did

consciously and willfully apply

the following FORBIDDEN colors to

the Pleasantville Town Hall:

(beat)

Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce,

Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox

Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson,

Yellow, Olive and Magenta.

DAVID

Um ... Yes I do. Where's our

lawyer?

BOB

We prefer to keep these

proceedings as "pleasant" as

possible. I don't think a lawyer

will be necessary.

BOB (CONT)

Do you further admit that this

was done surreptitiously and

under the cover of darkness?

DAVID

Well--it was dark out ...

BOB

Good. Do you further admit that

this unnatural depiction occurred

in full public view where it was

accessible to, and in plain sight

of, minor children?

DAVID

It was accessible to everyone.

BOB

Very well. Let the record show

that the defendants have answered

in the affirmative to all the

charges.

BOB (CONT)

Do you have anything to say in

your defense?

MR. JOHNSON

I didn`t mean to hurt anybody.

I just have to paint ... I

need to.

DAVID

I think I've got something to say.

BOB

Very well ...

DAVID

I think I know why you're doing

this. I mean, I understand why

you're doing this. I used to

feel the same way. I used to

want this place to stay just the

way it was. I never wanted it to

change ...

DAVID (CONT)

(he smiles slightly)

But nothing stays the same. You

get things, and you lose things,

and that's the good part and the

bad part--but you can't have a

good part without a bad part.

DAVID (CONT)

It's like the basketball team.

BOB

(leaning forward)

The basketball team?

DAVID

Sure. Everybody's upset because

they're not winning anymore--but

just think how it would feel if

all of a sudden they do win.

DAVID (CONT)

Wouldn't it feel better than when

they used to win all the time?

DAVID (CONT)

See, I know you want it to stay

"Pleasant" but there are so many

things that are so much better:

like Silly ... or Sexy ... or

Dangerous ... or Wild ... or

Brief ...

(beat)

And every one of those things is

in you all the time if you just

have the guts to look for them.

(pointing to the "colored" section)

Look at those faces back there.

They're no different than you are.

They just happened to see

something inside themselves that

you don't want to ...

BOB

Okay--that's enough!

DAVID

I thought I was allowed to

defend myself.

BOB

You're not allowed to lie.

DAVID

I'm not lying ... Here I'll show

you.

DAVID (CONT)

Mr. Simpson ...

MR. SIMPSON

Yes.

DAVID

What color is that hedge of yours?

MR. SIMPSON

Green.

DAVID

No, not that hedge. The other one.

MR. SIMPSON

The other one?

DAVID

The one in your mind. The one

that you see on a bright cold

morning. The one that you see

when you walk in front of your

house and you just stand there

and stare.

DAVID (CONT)

What color is that hedge?

BOB

I said, that's enough!

VARIOUS VOICES FROM

THE AUDIENCE

"No ... Let him finish ... Go on ..."

DAVID

Alright. Dad ...

GEORGE

(solemn)

Yes Bud.

DAVID

(beat)

Don't you miss her?

DAVID

I mean, of course you do, but it

isn't just the cooking or the

cleaning that you miss--it's

something else, isn't it ...

DAVID (CONT)

(softer whisper)

Maybe you can't even describe it.

Maybe you only know it when it's

gone. Maybe it's like there's a

whole piece of you that's missing

too.

(shrugs)

You might even call it "love."

BIG BOB

(BANGING the gavel loudly)

Okay, that's IT!!!

DAVID

(motioning toward the back)

Now don't you think she looks just

as pretty in color? Don't you

think she looks just as pretty as

she did the day you met her?

DAVID (CONT)

Don't you wish you could tell her

that?

BOB

(POUNDING the gavel)

YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!

DAVID

Why am I out of order?

BOB

BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO

TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!

DAVID

Well I don't think it's a circus.

And I don't think they do either.

BOB

THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.

DAVID

But see that's just the point. It

can't stop at once. Because it's

in you. And you can't stop

something that's in you.

BOB

(tightly)

It's not in ME.

DAVID

Oh sure it is.

BOB

No it isn't.

DAVID

(smug whisper)

What do you want to do to me

right now?

DAVID (CONT)

C'mon. Everyone's turning colors.

Kids are making out in the street.

No one's getting their dinner--

hell, you could have a flood any

minute ... Pretty soon you could

have the women going off to work

while the men stayed home and

cooked ...

BIG BOB

That's not going to happen!

DAVID

But it could happen.

BIG BOB

No it couldn't!

JENNIFER

Uch ... I am like gonna hurl ...

DISSOLVE TO:

DAVID

Are you sure?

JENNIFER

I told you. I'm like positive.

DAVID

This thing works. We could go

home right now.

JENNIFER

I'm not ready yet. I gotta do

this for a little while.

JENNIFER

Besides. You think there's like

a chance I'm gonna get into

college back there?

DAVID

(thinks ...)

Honestly ... no.

DAVID (CONT)

You got the admissions letter.

JENNIFER

Right here.

DAVID

And you're sure about this?

JENNIFER

I've done the slut thing, David.

It's really kinda old.

DAVID

I'll come back and check on you

in a month.

JENNIFER

You're like the coolest brother

in the world.

MARGARET

You're gonna forget about me.

DAVID

No I won't. I swear.

MARGARET

(a whisper)

I like calling you David.

DAVID

I like it too.

MR. JOHNSON

Well how do you know it won't go

back to the way it was?

DAVID

You're gonna keep painting aren't

you?

DAVID (CONT)

Well ...

MR. JOHNSON

(remembering something)

Oh.

(reaching into his pocket)

I've got something for you.

DAVID

It's beautiful.

MR. JOHNSON

Just a little--You know.

BETTY

(extending the bag)

I made you these for the trip.

They're marshmallow rice squares.

DAVID

Thanks. I thought you weren't

gonna ...

BETTY

(painful/

quieter)

I had to say goodbye.

BETTY (CONT)

There's a meatloaf sandwich in

there too. Don't go skipping

dinner just 'cause you're not

here anymore.

DAVID

I won't.

BETTY

(voice quivering)

And ... wear this on the trip in

case it gets cold.

DAVID

(nodding)

... It's a pretty short trip.

BETTY

I'm so proud of you, Bud.

DAVID

Thanks ... I love you.
