DOROTHY

Oh -- oh, the poor little things. Oh,

but Aunt Em, Miss Gulch hit Toto right

over the back with a rake just because

she says he gets in her garden and chases

her nasty old cat every day.

AUNT EM

Seventy --     Dorothy, please!

DOROTHY

Oh, but he doesn't do it every day --

just once or twice a week. And he can't

catch her old cat, anyway. And now she

says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --

AUNT EM

Dorothy!     Dorothy!   We're busy!

DOROTHY

Oh -- all right.

UNCLE HENRY

Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch

troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know,

she ought to have somebody to play with.

AUNT EM

I know, but we all got to work out our

own problems, Henry.

Yes.

Oh, I hope we got them in time.

Come on - come on - over this way.

ZEKE

Okay.

HICKORY

There you are.

HUNK

Right on my finger!

ZEKE

It's a lucky thing it wasn't your head.

DOROTHY

Zeke, what am I going to do about Miss

Gulch? Just because Toto chases her old

cat --

ZEKE

Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.

HUNK

Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your

head about Miss Gulch. Think you didn't

have any brains at all.

DOROTHY

I have so got brains.

HUNK

Well, why don't you use them? When you

come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's

place. Then Toto won't get in her

garden, and you won't get in no trouble.

See?

DOROTHY

Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's

all.

HUNK

Well, your head ain't made of straw, you

know.

HICKORY

Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are

rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk

kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a

poor sour-faced old maid that -- she

ain't got no heart left. You know, you

should have a little more heart yourself,

and have pity on her.

DOROTHY

Well, gee, I try and have a heart.

HICKORY

Now look, here's something that really

has a heart. This is the best invention I

ever invented.

DOROTHY

This?

HICKORY

Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't

have no more dust storms. Can you imagine

what it'll mean to this section of the

country? I'll show you. It works

perfectly now. Here's the principle. You

see that fan -- that sends up air

currents into the sky. These air currents

Oh!

going to let that old Gulch heifer try

and buffalo you?

ZEKE (CONT'D)

She ain't nothing to be afraid of.   Have

a little courage, that's all.

DOROTHY

I'm not afraid of her.

ZEKE

Then the next time she squawks, walk

right up to her and spit in her eye.

That's what I'd do!

Oh!

Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I

I'm the one that ought to be punished. I

me to bed without supper --

MISS GULCH

If you don't hand over that dog, I'll

He's really gentle -- with gentle people,

Well, that's for the Sheriff to decide.

Here's his order allowing me to take him.

Unless you want to go against the law.

DOROTHY

Well, what would you do with a brain if

you had one?

SCARECROW

Do?  Why, if I had a brain, I could --

(sings)

I could while away the hours, Conferrin'

with the flowers, Consultin' with the

rain. And my head I'd be scratchin' While

my thoughts were busy hatchin' If I only

had a brain. I'd unravel every riddle For

any individ'le

DOROTHY

(sings)

With the thoughts you'll be thinkin' You

could be another Lincoln If you only had

a brain.

SCARECROW

Oh, I could tell you why The ocean's near

And be even worthy erv you If I only had

a brain.

DOROTHY

Wonderful! Why, if our Scarecrow back in

Kansas could do that, the crows'd be

scared to pieces!

SCARECROW

They would?

DOROTHY

Um-hmm.

SCARECROW

Where's Kansas?

DOROTHY

That's where I live. And I want to get

back there so badly I'm going all the way

to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz

DOROTHY

Um-hmm.

SCARECROW

Do you think if I went with you this

Wizard would give me some brains?

DOROTHY

I couldn't say. But even if he didn't,

you'd be no worse off than you are now.

SCARECROW

Yes -- that's true.

DOROTHY

But maybe you'd better not. I've got a

witch mad at me, and you might get into

trouble.

SCARECROW

Witch? Huh! I'm not afraid of a witch!

I'm not afraid of anything --- except a

lighted match.

DOROTHY

I don't blame you for that.

SCARECROW

But I'd face a whole box full of them for

the chance of getting some brains. Look -

- I won't be any trouble, because I don't

eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage

things, because I can't think. Won't you

take me with you?

Why, of course I will!

WIZARD

...time!

ALL TOGETHER

Oh, no we haven't!

TIN MAN

You don't get around us that easy!

LION

Not nohow!

WIZARD

Well --

SCARECROW

You promised us real things -- a real...

SCARECROW

...brain!

LION

Real courage. That's what we want.

(CONTINUED)

118.

WIZARD

You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not

only surprise, but you grieve me.

WIZARD

Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a

very mediocre commodity. Every

pusillanimous creature that crawls on the

earth -- or slinks through slimy seas has

a brain!

WIZARD

From the rock-bound coast of Maine to the

Sun.... oh - oh, no -- -- ah - Well, be

that as it may. Back where I come from we

have universities, seats of great

learning -- where men go to become great

thinkers. And when they come out, they

think deep thoughts -- and with no more

brains than you have.... But! They have

one thing you haven't got! A diploma!

WIZARD

Therefore, by virtue of the authority

vested in me by the Universitatus

Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby

confer upon you the honorary degree of

Th.D.

SCARECROW

Th.D.?

WIZARD

Yeah -- that...that's Dr. of Thinkology!

(CONTINUED)

119.

SCARECROW

The sum of the square roots of any two

sides of an isosceles triangle is equal

to the square root of the remaining side.

Oh joy, rapture! I've got a brain!

SCARECROW

How can I ever thank you enough?

WIZARD

Well, you can't. As for you, my fine

friend -- you're a victim of disorganized

thinking. You are under the unfortunate

delusion that simply because you run away

from danger, you have no courage. You're

confusing courage with wisdom. Back

where I come from, we have men who are

called heroes. Once a year, they take

their fortitude out of mothballs and

parade it down the main street of the

city. And they have no more courage than

you have. But! They have one thing that

you haven't got! A medal! Therefore --

for meritorious....

WIZARD

...conduct, extraordinary valor,

conspicuous bravery against wicked

witches, I award you the Triple Cross.

WIZARD

You are now a member of the Legion of

Courage!

LION

Oh -- Oh -- shucks, folks, I'm

speechless!

(CONTINUED)

120.

WIZARD

As for you, my galvanized friend, you

want a heart! You don't know how lucky

you are not to have one. Hearts will

never be practical until they can be made

unbreakable. I could have been a world

figure, a power among men, a - a

successful wizard, had I not been

obstructed by a heart.

TIN MAN

But I still want one.

WIZARD

Yes -- ....

WIZARD

...back where I come from there are men

who do nothing all day but good deeds.

They are called phil...er -- er -- phil --

er, yes...good-deed-doers. And their

hearts are no bigger than yours. But!

They have one thing you haven't got! A

testimonial!

WIZARD

Therefore, in consideration of your

kindness, I take pleasure at this time in

presenting you with a small token of our

esteem and affection. And remember, my

sentimental friend....

WIZARD

...that a heart is not judged by how much

you love, but by how much you are loved

by others.

(CONTINUED)

121.

TIN MAN

Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!    Listen!

DOROTHY

Yes...!

DOROTHY

...yes.

TIN MAN

Look -- it ticks!

LION

Read...read what my medal says.

LION

Courage!...

LION

...Ain't it the truth!    Ain't it the

truth!

DOROTHY

Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.

SCARECROW

Hey -- what about Dorothy?

TIN MAN

Yes -- how about Dorothy?

LION

Yeah.

WIZARD

Ah --

LION

Dorothy next!

(CONTINUED)

122.

WIZARD

Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor -- CU --

Dorothy --

DOROTHY

Oh, I don't think there's anything in

that black bag for me.

WIZARD

Well, no - no -- on the contrary, on the -

--- ....

WIZARD

...I -- ah -- on the contr -- -- Here --

Well, you force me into a cataclysmic

decision. The only way to get Dorothy

back to Kansas is for me to take her

there myself! CU -- Dorothy reacts,

speaks --

DOROTHY

Oh, will you? Could you? Oh -- but are

you a clever enough Wizard.... MCU -- The

Wizard -- DOROTHY o.s.

WIZARD

Child -- you cut me to the quick! I'm an

old Kansas man myself...born and....

WIZARD

...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland

Carnival Company -- until one day, while

performing spectacular feats of

stratospheric skill never before

attempted by civilized man, an

unfortunate phenomena occurred. The

balloon failed to return to the fair.

(CONTINUED)

123.

LION

It did?

WIZARD

Yes. There was I, floating through space -

- a man without a continent! CU --

Dorothy --

DOROTHY

Weren't you frightened?

WIZARD

Frightened? You are talking to a man who

has laughed in the face of death --

sneered at doom and chuckled at

catastrophe. I was petrified. Then

suddenly the wind changed, and the

balloon floated down into the heart of

this noble city, where I was instantly

acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!

DOROTHY

Ohhh!

WIZARD

Times being what they were, I accepted

the job, -- retaining my balloon against

the advent of a quick get-away.

(laughs)

And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you

and I will return to the land of E

Pluribus Unum!

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

WIZARD

Good people of Oz, this is positively the

finest exhibition ever to be shown --

(stammers)

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

124.

WIZARD (CONT'D)

-- yes -- well -- be that as it may -- I,

your Wizard par ardua ad alta, am about

to embark upon a hazardous and

technically unexplainable journey into

the outer stratosphere.

WIZARD

To confer, converse, and otherwise hob-

nob with my brother wizards. And I

hereby decree that until what time -- if

any -- that I return, the Scarecrow, by

virtue of his highly superior brains,

shall rule in my stead...assisted by the

Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent

heart...and the Lion -- by virtue of his

courage! Obey them as you would me! And -

ah - well, that's all.

DOROTHY

Oh, come back here!   Toto!

DOROTHY

Come back! Oh, don't go without me! I'll

be right back! Toto!

TIN MAN

Stop that dog!

WIZARD

This is a highly irregular procedure!

This is absolutely unprecedented!

(CONTINUED)

125.

TIN MAN

Oh!    Help me! The balloon's going up!

WIZARD

-- Ruined my exit!

TIN MAN

Help!

DOROTHY

Oh! Come back! Don't go without me!

Please come back!

WIZARD

I can't come back!     I don't know how it

works!

DOROTHY

Oh --

WIZARD

Goodbye, folks!

OZ PEOPLE

Goodbye!   Goodbye!

DOROTHY

Oh, now I'll never get home!

LION

Stay with us, then, Dorothy. We all love

you. We don't want you to go.

DOROTHY

Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this

could never be like Kansas. Auntie Em

must have stopped wondering what happened

to me by now. Oh, Scarecrow, what am I

going to do?

SCARECROW

Look -- here's someone who can help you!

(CONTINUED)

126.

DOROTHY

Oh, will you help me?   Can you help me?

GLINDA

You don't need to be helped any longer.

You've always had the power to go back to

Kansas.

DOROTHY

I have?

SCARECROW

Then why didn't you tell her before?

GLINDA

Because she wouldn't have believed me.

She had to learn it for herself.

TIN MAN

What have you learned, Dorothy?

DOROTHY

Well, I -- I think that it -- that it

wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle

Henry and Auntie Em -- and it's that --

if I ever go looking for my heart's

desire again, I won't look any further

than my own backyard. Because if it

isn't there, I never really lost it to

begin with! Is that right?

GLINDA

That's all it is!

SCARECROW

But that's so easy! I should have

thought of it for you.

(CONTINUED)

127.

TIN MAN

I should have felt it in my heart.

GLINDA

No. She had to find it out for herself.

Now, those magic slippers will take you

home in two seconds!

DOROTHY

Oh....

DOROTHY

...Toto, too?

GLINDA

Toto, too.

DOROTHY

Oh, now?

GLINDA

Whenever you wish.

DOROTHY

Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be

true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so

hard to say goodbye. I love you all,

too. Goodbye, Tin Man. Oh, don't cry.

You'll rust so dreadfully. Here --

here's your oil-can. Goodbye.

TIN MAN

Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause

it's breaking.

DOROTHY

Oh -- Goodbye, Lion. You know, I know

it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the

way you used to holler for help before

you found your courage.

LION

Well -- I would never've found it if it

hadn't been for you.

(CONTINUED)

128.

DOROTHY

I think I'll miss you most of all.

GLINDA

Are you ready now?

DOROTHY

Yes.    Say goodbye, Toto.

DOROTHY

Yes, I'm ready now.

GLINDA

Then close your eyes, and tap your heels

together three times.

GLINDA

And think to yourself -- "There's no

place like home; there's no place like

home; there's no place like home."

DOROTHY

There's no place like home. There's no

place like home. There's no place like

home. There's no place like home.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

DOROTHY

(mumbling)

-- there's no place like home -- there's

no place like home --

DOROTHY

-- no place like home -- there's no place

like home -- no place --

AUNT EM

Dorothy.   Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em,

darling.

DOROTHY

Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!

AUNT EM

Yes, darling.

PROFESSOR MARVEL

Hello, there! Anybody home? I -- I just

dropped by because I heard the little

girl got caught in the big -- Well....

(CONTINUED)

130.

UNCLE HENRY

She got quite a bump on the head -- we

kinda thought there for a minute she was

going to leave us.

PROFESSOR

Oh --

DOROTHY

But I did leave you, Uncle Henry --

that's just the trouble. And I tried to

get back for days and days.

AUNT EM

There, there, lie quiet now.   You just

had a bad dream.

DOROTHY

No --

HUNK

Sure -- remember me -- your old pal,

Hunk?

HICKORY

And me -- Hickory?

ZEKE

You couldn't forget my face, could you?

DOROTHY

No. But it wasn't a dream -- it was a

place. And you -- and you -- and you --

and you were there.

PROFESSOR

Oh --

(others laugh)

DOROTHY

But you couldn't have been, could you?

AUNT EM

Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we

--

DOROTHY

No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly

live place. And I remember that some of

it wasn't very nice....

(CONTINUED)

131.

DOROTHY

...but most of it was beautiful. But

just the same, all I kept saying to

everybody was, I want to go home. And

they sent me home.

DOROTHY

Doesn't anybody believe me?

UNCLE HENRY

Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

DOROTHY

Oh, but anyway, Toto, we're home!

DOROTHY

Home! And this is my room -- and you're

all here! And I'm not going to leave

here ever, ever again, because I love you

all! And -- Oh, Auntie Em -- there's no

place like home!
