LIAR LIAR

Tom Shadyac & Mike Binder

Rough draft, April 1996

MS. BERRY

"Work." Today we're going to

share what our parents do for

work.

JEFF

My dad is a truck driver.

MELINDA

My mommy is a doctor.

CAROLYN

My dad is a librarian and my

mom is a vegetarian.

THEODORE

(with difficulty)

My father is a struck-sher-al-

engine-ear.

CRAIG     -

My mother is an actress. She

works at Denny's.

KELLY

My daddy works at a place

where they make stuff, and my

mommy is a mommy.

ELLIOT

(looking a little

CRAZED)

My father is a postal worker.

MAX

My mom's a teacher.

MS. BERRY

And your dad?

MAX

(HESITANT)

My dad? He's . . . a liar.

MS. BERRY

(taken aback)

A liar? I don't think you

mean "a liar."

MAX

Well... he wears a suit and

goes to court and talks to the

judge and--

MS. BERRY

(RELIEVED)

Oh! I see-- you mean he's a

lawyer.

Max shrugs.

INT. COURTROOM .-- DAY

FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His

manner is utterly genuine and convincing.

FLETCHER

A dark street. . . a stormy

night... two desperate men

struggle... one man is taken

to the hospital, the other to

ja il. The prosecutor wants

you to believe this is an

open-and-shut case of a poor

man, brutally victimized.

He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Well, for once I agree with

t he prosecutor. This is an

open-and shut case -- but the

true victim is my client.

Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Put yourself in his shoes for

a moment--walking home from

church, alone, in a

frightening part of the

suburbs.

As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM

OUT:

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

You're nervous, timid, looking

over your shoulder -- when

suddenly, you encounter him--

(pointing at the

old man)

pouncing from the shadows.

You quiver in fear. The

streetlight flashes on

something shiny in his hand--

a knife?

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

And in that terrifying instant

you do what any respectable

citizen would -- you defend

y ou rse lf. Only after you

shatter his arm and collarbone

do you realize it's all a

mistake... the man was merely

walking away from an ATM

machine, the apparent flash of

metal caused by his bank card.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

(CONCERNED)

As you stand over his

crumpled, though potentially

still-dangerous form, your

he art goes out to him. You

want to help. First, you

gather up the many bills he

dropped, to stop them from

bl owi ng away. Second, in an

effort to get the name and

number of someone to notify,

you take his wallet. Finally,

you leap into the man's Lexus

to head for assistance, when

suddenly a police car speeds

up. You breathe a sigh of

relief: "Someone to look -after

the injured man! Oh joy!"

But do the police applaud your

initiative? Do they hail your

heroism? No-- they arrest you

and throw you in the slammer!

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

And why? Why does the State

turn its massive power against

this individual?

(takes an

IMPRESSIVE

moment, then

answers his own

QUESTION:)

Discrimination,

(to a black

JUROR)

But this time it's not based

on race.

(to a female

JUROR)

Not based on gender.

(to a man wearing

a crucifix)

Not based on religion,

(to a heavy set

JUROR)

No--this time it's

discrimination based on size!

. I know what the prosecution

wants you to think - - i t ' s

always the big guy's fault.

Is that what we've come to as

a society -- persecuting

people because they're large?

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Shame on you, Mister

Prosecutor! Shame on you!

(turning back to

JURY)

The state is trying to

barbeque my client on the spit

of Justice. Only you can douse

the flames. The decision is

your s. And please...don't let

your emotions run away with

y ou . The fact that my client

is a family man, raising his

sons alone after the tragic

death of their mother, has

absolutely no bearing on this

case.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Instead, let cold reason be

your guide as you decide the

fate of this church-going,

orphan-rasing widower!

LAWYER

How's it going, Fletcher?

FLETCHER

(he' s won)

Another gratifying day serving

Justice.

CLIENT

Hey great job, Mr. Reid. I

wish there was some way I

could show my appreciation.

FLETCHER

Stay out of my neighborhood

after dark.

PUBLICIST

Mr. Reid, do you have a

moment-?

FLETCHER

No, I'm late picking up my

son.

PUBLICIST

-Because a couple of reporters

want to interview you about

your big win today.

FLETCHER    ..

How's my hair?

MAX

What time is it?

AUDREY

(checks her

WATCH)

I ' m sure he just got tied up

in court again.

MAX

Dad!

FLETCHER

Maximillian!

(calls out a

COMMAND)

TRANSFORMERS!! .

FLETCHER

Malfunction in vector 3 ! !

Malfunction in vector 3!!

(pretends to lose

control of a

'robotic' arm)

Look out! It's on tickle

mode!!

FLETCHER

(re: Audrey)

And who is this lovely lady?

Max, could you introduce me?

MAX

That's no lady, that's mom!

AUDREY.

Thanks, Max.

FLETCHER

Mom? !

(under his

BREATH)

Himnm. . . I don't remember her

looking that good,

(becomes the

robot again)

Malfunction in Vector 4!

Malfunction in Vector 4!

AUDREY

(PLAYFULLY)

Keep Vector 4 away from me.

Unless you want Vector 4

chopped off.

FLETCHER

You know, you were much easier

when we were married...

(re: her luggage)

So where are you off too?

AUDREY

Stanford. I'm delivering a

paper.

FLETCHER

O h really? Where I live, we

use a boy on a bike.

MAX

Hey mom, dad's taking me to

see wrestling!

AUD REY

(MILDLY

PROTESTING)

Oh, Fletcher!

FLETCHER

(PLAYFULLY

mimicking her)

Oh, Audrey!

AUDREY

Do you have to take him to

tho se things? They're so

violent.

FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE

The boy must learn the way of

the war rior . An d wh o be tter

to teach him than Rowdy Rod- .

Piper and Big John Stud?

FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE

He must be schooled in the way

of the face-claw, the sleeper-

hold, and the purple nuxple.

For only then--

AUDREY

(PLAYFULLY)

Shut up!!

FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE

(to Max)

The squaw will never

understand us.

JERRY

Max, my man!

JERRY

Fletcher, good to see you?

FLETCHER

What? No kiss for me?

JERRY

(re: luggage)

What do you say, Max? Give me

a hand?

FLETCHER

(to Audrey)

I didn't know the boyfriend

was going.

AUDREY

Jerry. His name is Jerry and

yes, he's going.

FLETCHER

T o Stanford? Overnight? Does

this mean you two are...

(cringes, can't

say the words)

AUDREY

I've been seeing him seven

months, what do you think?

FLETGHER

I was hoping that after being

married to me, you'd have no

more strength left.

AUDREY

. Well you have to remember when

we were married, I wasn't

having sex nearly as often as

you were.

FLETCHER

MEDIC!! I've been hit.

/-

FLETCHER

Well, great... I'm so happy

for you two. I am just Mister

H appy man. Happy, happy,

happy.

AUDREY

Relax, Fletcher. It looks

like Jerry's taking that job

offer in Boston.

FLETCHER

Aud, I am so sorry...

JERRY

(calling to

AUDREY)

Ready?

FLETCHER

(to Audrey)

Yo u gonna be okay? Because if

not, we could leave Max with

your sister and I could go out

with you two, does that appeal

to you at all?

FLETCHER

Wave to the soon-to-be ex-

boyfriend, Max.

(flipping Max the

KEYS)

You drive.

MAX

Dad, are we really going to go

to wrestling?

FLETCHER

Absolutely, Maxattacker. We

just have to stop by the

office for one minute.

BEGGAR

'Scuse me, sir. Do you have

any change?

FLETCHER

(patting his

POCKETS)

'Fraid not. Sorry.

PHILIP

Fletcher!

FLETCHER

Philip!

PHILIP

And this must be Max!

FLETCHER

(trying to brush

him off)

. Yes. Yes it is. Well, it was

good seeing you--

PHILIP

You know, Ethel and I had a

blast at our last little get-

together.

FLETCHER

Oh, me too. I can never get

enough of charades. We'll

have to do it again sometime.

PHILIP

When?

FLETCHER

Soon.

PHILIP

How 'bout tonight?

FLETCHER

Not that soon. I'm taking Max

to see wrestling--

PHILIP

We love wrestling.     We could--

FLETCHER

I don't think so. See, Max is

really shy around strangers.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Tell you what -- give me your

card as a reminder. I'll call

y o u . Soon. Promise.

PHILIP

Great!

JANE

Hi, Mr. Reid.

(indicates, her

HAIR)

What do you think?

FLETCHER

Fabulous! I love it.

(indicates the

BASKET)

What's this?

JANE

I don't know who sent it. But

it's for Mr. Allan. It's his

anniversary.

FLETCHER

Ah... The Partnership

Committee meeting still

scheduled for Friday?

JANE

(as she goes)

Yep...

MAX

What are you doing?

FLETCHER

Oh, I'm... fixing the card,

(shows him the

old card)

Look, they spelled Mr. Allan's

name wrong. Have an apple.

FRED

I can't do it.

M IRANDA

Fred, it's your duty to

present the strongest case

possible.

FRED

The strongest case possible,

consistent with the truth.

MIRANDA

Let the Judge decide what's

true. That's what he gets

paid for. You get paid to

win.

FRED

If you insist on my taking it

to trial, I'll represent Mrs.

Cole aggressively and

ethically. But, Miranda -- I

won't lie.

MIRANDA

Then we'll just have to find

someone who'will.

FLETCHER

Hey, Pete! Great tie!        .

FLETCHER

Thomas--looks like you're

losin' weight.

THOMAS

Gained three pounds.

FLETCHER

(wedging past

HIM)

On you, it works.

GRETA '

M ax ! What's new?

.MAX

Well. . . it's my birthday

tomo rrow. We're having a

party and everything.

GRE TA

I'm sure your dad'11 give you

something wonderful.

MAX

Yeah?

FLETCHER

Oh, yeah. You're going to

love it. Uh, why don't you

play in my office for a

minute? Fax something, sue

someone, have a good time.

We'll be leaving in a second.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Damn!   I completely forgot.

GRETA

Oh, there's a surprise.

FLETCHER

You're a saint. I should get

you something.

GRETA

You did.

FLETCHER

Ah. Well, I always do the

classy thing. Any calls?

GRETA

. Let's see.. .

(CHECKING

MESSAGES)

Judge Patterson's clerk. He

needs your filing.

FLETCHER

Tell him it's in the mail.

GRETA

(jotting down a

NOTE)

Right. You'll do it next

week. Mr. McKinley phoned,

questioning that fourteen

hours you billed on Christinas

Eve.

FLETCHER

Write him a long, explanatory

letter. Then bill him for the

letter.

GRETA

(jotting down a

. note).    ..

Done. Your mother called.

FLETCHER

I ' m on vacation.

GRETA

This is your fifth week.      .      .

FLETCHER

It's a long vacation.

GRETA

(jotting down a

NOTE)

"Break mother's heart." Done.

And that's it, except

Miranda's looking for you.

FLETCHER

(checking watch)

As if I don't have anything

better to do than bow and

scrape at her royal perfumed

p artner feet. Tell her I'm in

court.

GRETA

Court's closed.

FLETCHER

Tell her I broke my leg and

had to be shot.

GRETA

(WHISPERS)

Why don't you tell her

yourself?

FLETCHER

--And then send out a notice

of judgement on my win today!

GRETA

(DRY)

I'll get right on it.

FLETCHER

Miranda! I didn't see you.

Hey, you look lovely, today.

Here, I bought you a gift.

MIRANDA

Thanks. I heard about your

victory today. You're making

quite an impression on the

partnership committee.

FLETCHER

(FEIGNING

PUZZLEMENT;

THEN)

Oh, that's right. You folks

are meeting again soon.

"Allan, Stewart, Konigsberg,

and Ried." There's something

about the rhythm of fours.

It's like a full measure.

Well, anyway, I've got a

client waiting in my office--

MIRANDA .

Actually, something important

h as come up. You're not busy

tonight, are you?

CUT TO:

MAX

We're not going, are we?

FLETCHER

Of course we are. A promise

i s a promise. We are gonna

see wrestling or my name isn't

Fletcher T. Reid.

FLETCHER

(to wrestler)

Could you hand me that?

(the wrestler

DOES)

Thank you.

(without looking

UP)

We are having some fun, eh

Maxer?

AUDREY

Are you alright?

JERRY

Uh, yeah, just, uh... how long

are you gonna be on the phone?

AUDREY

I just wanted to say good-

night to Max, but he must

still be out with Fletcher,

(hangs up)

JERRY

(SUDDENLY)

Will you marry me?

I

AUDREY

Uh...would I . . . ? What did you

say?

JERRY

(NERVOUS)

I proposed, I . . . Look, I know

this Boston thing is a great

opportunity, good job,

mo ney .. . everything. But I

started to think about being

three thousand miles away from

you and Max. And I didn't

like it. I-- Look, I know

it's a lot to ask, to move and

everything, but I . . . . I love

you. I love your son.   Will

you marry me?

FLETCHER

Max Factor... Happy birthday.

How old are you today?

T h ir t y ? Forty?

MAX

Five.

FLETCHER

Well, you've held up well. I

only wish there was some way

to commemorate such an

occasion, some small symbol to

mark this day, like....

FLETCHER

. . . A present! .

MAX

What is it?

FLETCHER

(no idea)

It's... it's.

(it hits him)

a surprise.

MAX

Baseball stuff!

_J

FLETCHER

Baseball stuff.

MAX

(hugging his dad)

Will you play catch with me?

FLETCHER            '

:

Absorootentootenlutely.

FLETCHER

Tonight. After your party,

you have my word on it.

AUDR EY

(re: tickets)

Jerry, these are for tomorrow.

JERRY

The company wants me to get

started right away.

AUDREY

I can't just pick up and move

to Boston with two days

notice.

JERRY

Ju st come check it out. You

a nd Max, see the town. Let's

. pick out a place together.

Then, if you want to turn me

down and scar me for life,

fine.

AUDREY

It's just not that simple...

What about my job? I've been

at UCLA three years.

JERRY

It's New England. They're

lousy with colleges. You

can't swing a bat back there

without hitting a college.

You'd get a job there in a

second.

AUDREY

There are other factors

involved.

(POINTS)

T here they are now.       .

AUDREY

Did you have fun? How were

the wrestling matches?

FLETCHER

Big fun. Manly fun. Am I

right, Maxie?

MAX

(HALF-HEARTEDLY)

It was fun..

FLETCHER

(re: Audrey)

So how were the wrestling

matches ? Did you have fun?

JERRY

Max , my man! My happy

birthday man!

JERRY

One-two-three-four-five... and

one for good luck.

FLETCHER

Did you see that? He struck

the child!

MAX

Look what dad got me!

(shows the glove)

JERRY

Whoa! Great! I have my glove

in the car. We'll stop in the

park on the way home and play

c atch. Then tonight we'll oil

it, wrap a rubber band around

it. . . It'll be great.

(to Fletcher)

Great birthday present, dad!

FLETCHER          .

(makes a fist)

When is it his birthday?

AUDREY

Some thing's come up. We need

to talk.

MAX

Mom, let's go. I want to

play.

AUDREY

(to Fletcher)

We'll talk tonight.

FLETCHER

Tonight?

AUDREY

Max's birthday?

FLETCHER'

Oh , yeah, right. Seven. I

knew that. I did. I blocked

it out weeks ago. The

se ven tee nt h of May. Max's

birthday.

AUDREY

It's the eighteenth.

FLETCHER

The seventeenth of May is the

day I .remind myself that the

eighteenth is Max's birthday.

See you tonight.

VIRGINIA

This is good. This is really

smart.

FLETCHER

Thank you.

VIRGINIA

Only i t ' s . . . Like not true.

Every word of it is a lie.

VIRGINIA (CONT'D)

I mean... isn't that a

problem?

FLETCHER

Mrs. Cole, the only problem

here is that after you've

provided years of faithful

service and loving support, of

raising his children -- They

are his?

VIRGINIA

H m ? Oh yeah. One for sure.

FLETCHER

After all that, your husband

wants to deny you a fair share

of the marital assets based on

one single act of

]

INDISCRETION--

VIRGINIA

Seven.

FLETCHER

Hm?

VIRGINIA

Seven single acts of

indiscretion.

FLETCHER

--Seven acts of indiscretion,

only one of which he has any

evidence of, and all of which

he himself is responsible, for.

VIRGINIA

He is?

FLETCHER

VIRGINIA

FLETCHER

(not missing a

BEAT)

VIRGINIA

(to Miranda)

FLETCHER

VIRGINIA

(getting worked

UP)

FLETCHER

(takes her hand)

VIRGINIA

Yes! I ' m tired of getting

kicked around.

FLETCHER

Good for you!

VIRGINIA

Thank you, Mr. Reid. I ' m so

grateful I have an attorney I

can trust.

MIRANDA

You're good. You're really

good.

FLETCHER

Oh, pshaw.

(pronounces it

with the "p")

MIRANDA

N o, I mean it. The Cole case

is worth a truckload of money

to this firm, not to mention

the press it's going to

g en er at e . You win this case

and I guarantee you'll make

partner.

(STRAIGHTENING

his tie)

Actually, how would you like

to make a partner right now?

FLETCHER

Excuse me?

CLOWN

(SINGING)

Captain Fuzzy is my name,

Making children happy is my

game,

With a shake and a juggle,

And a big belt buckle,

You'll all be glad I came. '

AUDREY

(indicating the

CLOWN)

What do you think?

JERRY

Well, if you don't hire your

brother, who will?

.

JERRY

They called me again from

B oston. They really want me

there tomorrow.

AUDREY

. . . I can't go to Boston.

JERRY

How come?

AUDREY

Max.

JERRY

He'll love it there.

AUDREY

It's Fletcher.

JERRY

Fletcher?

AUDREY

I can't move Max three

thousand miles away from his

father.

JERRY

Audrey, I have never said a

bad word about your ex --

AUDREY

I know.

JERRY

But how much responsibility

does Fletcher take for Max,

now? He'd never come over if

you didn't remind him.

AUDREY

I know. But if they're three

thousand miles apart they'll

never see each other.

Fletcher will never come to

Boston and how can I send Max

cross-country to him?

.JERRY

So because your ex-husband is

unreliable, we can't-'-

AUDREY

I know, it's not logical, it's

emotional. I'm sorry.

JERRY

I still want to marry you.

AUDREY

Are you sure?

JERRY

(into phone)

Mr. Crisitelli, Jerry

She!ton... I hope I'm not

calling too late... Mr.

Crisitelli, I'm afraid I have

to turn down your offer..'. So

am I . . . Well, I've fallen in

love with this beautiful woman

in L.A. and she doesn't want

to leave and I won't leave

without her... Well, thank you

very much... Yes, good-bye.

(hangs up)

He wasn't there, but that's

1   the speech I would've made.

AUDREY

Hello...

A UDREY

Fletcher, where are you?

We're getting ready to cut the

cake.

FLETCHER

Urn, actually, something has

come up. A problem on a new

caaa--                .

F LET CHE R

A-h-h-h-!

AUDREY

What happened?

FLETCHER

Nothing. I just nailed my

knee into the desk... Listen,

I'm really sorry I can't 'make

it.

AUDREY

Max is going to be so

disappointed.

FLETCHER

I'll make it up to him, I

promise. I'll pick him up

from school tomorrow, okay?

AUDREY

Do you want me to put him on

the phone?

FLETCHER

Ah, no.     I have to go.

AUDREY

Right.

AUDREY

All right, birthday boy, make

a wish.

AUDREY (CONT'D)

C'mon, honey. It can be

anything-- whatever you want

most in the world.

AUDREY (CONT'D)

Max, your dad is sorry. He

had to work.

MAX

He said he was coming. He

promised.

AUDREY

Yes, well, he... promises

he'll see you tomorrow.

I wish, for just one day, Dad

couldn't tell a lie.

CUT TO:

MIRANDA

S o . . . was it good for you?

FLETCHER

I've had better.

FLETCHER

"I've had better?"

FLETCHER

"I've had better?!"

FLETCHER

(laughing it off)

"I've had better?"

FLETCHER

New in the building?

MODEL

I just moved in Monday.

FLETCHER

Ah. Well, you must allow me

to give you the grand tour.

MODEL

(SHE'S

INTERESTED)

O h? Do you do that for all

the new tenants?

FLETCHER

No. Just the ones I want to

bang like a drum.

BEGGAR

Any change, Mister?

.FLETCHER

Absolutely.

BEGGAR

Could you spare some?

FLETCHER

Unquestionably.

BEGGAR

Will you?

FLETCHER

No.

BEGGAR

How come?

FLETCHER

Because I resent your

p re sen ce. You fill me with an

unpleasant mixture of disgust

and guilt. Further, I don't

believe you'll use the money

for food, but I believe you'll

use it for, at worst, drugs,

or, at best, whiskey, or

. cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap.

BEGGAR

Jerkoff.

VIRGINIA

You look like you're having a

rough morning.

FLETCHER

I've had better.

DANA

Good morning, Fletcher.

FLETCHER

Dana.         "

RICHARD

All right, Virginia, how much

will it take to put an end to

this?

FLETCHER

Fifty per cent of your estate.

DANA

Fifty per cent? With a pre-

nup and proof of adultery?

What's your case?

FLETCHER

Our case is simply this. . .

DANA        .

Interesting, though based on

your track record, I expected

a little more.

FLETCHER   ..

Wa it! Wait!    I've got it in

writing!

DANA

Let go!

FLETCHER

I'm trying!

BAILIFF

All rise for the Honorable

Judge William Stevens.

DANA

Very funny, Fletcher. You

want to play hardball, I'm

game.

JUDGE STEVENS

Calling case BA 09395, Richard

Cole versus Virginia Cole.

How're we doing this morning,

counsel?

DANA

Fine, thank you.

JUDGE STEVENS

And you, Mr. Reid?

FLETCHER

Well, I'm a little upset about

a bad sexual episode I had

last night--

JUDGE STEVENS

(DRYLY)

Well, you're still young.

It'll happen more and more.

In the meantime, what do you

say we get. down to business?

First, Mr. Reid, I see that

your client was previously

represented by Mr. Rand of

your office.

FLETCHER

Yes, Your Honor.

JUDGE STEVENS

I take it you're seeking to

substitute in as counsel?

FLETCHER

Yes, Your Honor.

JUDGE STEVENS

Fine , fine. And for the

record, the reason is?

FLETCHER

Mr. Rand had severe ethical

objections to my client's

case.

JUDGE STEVENS

I take it you don't share the

same ethical objections, Mr.

Reid?

FLETCHER

I have lower standards, Your

Honor.

JUDGE STEVENS

I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole

wants the substitution of

counsel, I'll allow it. Is

that what you want, Mrs. Cole?

VIRGINIA

(UNSURE)

Yes?

JUDGE STEVENS

Fine.

VIRGINIA

(aside, to

FLETCHER)

What are you doing?

FLETCHER

(WORRIED)

.

I don't know.

(to judge, with

SOME

DESPERATION)

Your Honor, I ' d like a

continuance!

JUDGE STEVENS "

This case has already been

delayed several times, Mr.

Reid.

FLETCHER

I realize that, Your Honor,

but I ' d really, really, really

like a continuance.

JUDGE STEVENS

I'll have to hear good cause,

counselor. What's the

problem?

FLETCHER

I can't lie!

JUDGE STEVENS

(IMPATIENT)

Commendable, Mr. Reid, but I'm

still waiting for the good

caus e. Now, do you have it or

. not?

'            FLETCHER

(TRUTHFUL)

Not.

JUDGE STEVENS

Motion for a continuance

denied. Is there any chance

of a settlement in this case?

DANA

I don't think so, Your Honor.

Mr. Reid made it abundantly

clear that the last thing in

the world he wanted was to --

FLETCHER

(DESPERATE)

SETTLE! SETTLE! SETTLE!

JUDGE STEVENS

There appears to have been a

change in strategy. Let's go

to my chambers and negotiate.

DANA

Your Honor, under the terms of

the prenuptual agreement, if

Mrs. Cole commits adultery,

she is entitled to nothing.

We have in our possession an

audiotape made by a licensed

private investigator of an

explicit act of sexual

congress with a man who is not

her husband.

JUDGE STEVENS

Sounds pretty damning, Mr.

Reid.

FLETCHER

It certainly does.

DANA

However, my client has no

desire to see his ex-wife

destitute. Against my advice,

he's willing to offer her a

cash settlement of.two point

four million dollars.

JUDGE STEVENS

Two four seems like a pretty

fair offer, Mr. Reid.

FLETCHER

Fantastically fair.

Phenominally fair. In fact,

I'd say beyond fair, bordering

on stupid.

JUDGE STEVENS

What are you suggesting, Mr.

Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's

willingness to proffer such an

offer betrays a lack of faith

in her position?

FLETCHER

(utterly sincere)

No, not at all. She's got my

client dead to rights. When

attorneys go to sleep at

night, they dream of having a

case as strong as hers.

DANA

Can the sarcasm, Reid. All

right, I admit it -- I've seen

you make even the lamest case

fly. But this time I have

you. Even Clarence Darrow

couldn't explain this away.

JUDGE SAMIOAN

Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a

dynamite explanation, I'd say

you're dead in the water.

How's you client's story?

FLETCHER

The best that money can buy,

Y o u r Honor.

JUDGE STEVENS

Strong corroborating evidence?

FLETCHER

We have evidence that you are

not going to-believe.

JUDGE STEVENS

You're pretty confident how

this trial is going to come

out, eh, Mr. Reid?

FLETCHER

(hopeless) .

"Confident" is too weak a

word, Your Honor. I am

certain what will happen if I

take this puppy to trial. The

verdict will be a stunning,

humiliating defeat that will

cut a spectacularly promising

legal career off at the knees.

DANA

All right! Double the offer!

Four point eight! And not a

penny more.

(venomous, to

FLETCHER)

Bastard!

JUDGE STEVENS

You are some negotiator, Mr.

Reid. If your client has half

a brain, she'll jump at the

offer.

CUT TO:

VIRGINIA

No!

FLETCHER

No? ! Mrs. Cole, this offer

was a miracle. I'm talking

about a walking-on-water,

Lazarus-rising-from-the-dead,

FIND-NO-LINE-AT-THE-FRIGGIN'-

DMV miracle! You've gone from

two point four to four point

eight million in...

(checks his

WATCH)

four minutes. Think of it

this way -- now you're getting

paid seven hundred thou per

schtupp!

VIRGINIA

Mr. Reid, you convinced me

yesterday -- I'm the victim

here, starved for affection,

driven into the arms of

another man--

FLETCHER

Seven!

VIRGINIA

-- Seven other men. With the

story you came up with, I

don't think I can lose. I

want to proceed.

FLETCHER

Mrs. Cole, you don't        .

understand, I--

JUDGE STEVENS

Well , Mr. Reid. Do we have a

settlement?

JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)

Th ere' s no settlement. Trial

to start at one-thirty sharp.

JANE

What do you think?

FLETCHER .

I think you need help.

THOMAS

What's shakin', Fletcher?

FLETCHER

Your cellulite, Tubster.

FRED

Hiy a, Fletcher. How's the

Cole case going?

FLETCHER

(not stopping)

'Straight into the crapper, you

wuss, with my career right

behind it.

P

FLETC HER

LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA!!

GRETA

Hi, boss. What's happening

WITH--

FLETCHER

DON'T ASK! FOR GOD'S SAKE,

PLEASE DON'T ASK!

FLETCHER,

(PACING)

Do n't panic. You can beat

this -- it's all a matter of

willpower.

FL ET CH ER

A test. . . Something small...

Aha!

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Red.   Red. All right. Focus,

(with great

DELIBERATION)

The color of this pen is  r--.

R--. R--! The color of this

pen is--blue! AAAAHH!

(burying his

HEAD)

Ahhhh! One' tiny lie and I

can't say it!!

(suddenly sitting

UP)

' I'll write.it!

"This pen is blue."

F LE TC HE R

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! ! ! !

GRETA

Boss, what's wrong?

FLETCHER

. The pen is blue!! The pen is     .

b l u e ! ! The GODDAMN PEN IS

BLUE !!!

GRETA

Red?

FLETCHER

(BITTER)

Oh, that's easy for you to

say?!

GRETA

Are you all right?

FLETCHER

(getting up)

I have to go home.

GRETA

Home? Was the case settled?

FLETCHER

No. I have to be in court at

one-thirty.

GRETA

Well, then how can you.go

home?

FLETCHER

I don't know, I don't know!!!

GRETA

Okay.

(walking on

EGGSHELLS)

Before I forget -- Rubin and

Dun n called. They want to

know where the Darvis

settlement offer stands.

FLETCHER

I only proposed a settlement

t o dick with them. I never

had any intention of going

th ro ug h with it.  .

GRETA

'...dick with them." Okay.

Your accountant, Philip,

called to remind you about

getting together. .

FLETCHER

I'd rather shave my ass and

sit in vinegar..

GRETA

(jotting down a

NOTE)

Got it. And your mother

called again. Are you still

on vacation?

FLETCHER

(EMPHATICALLY

nodding "yes")

No.

GRETA

So then you're here?

FLETCHER

(EMPHATICALLY

shaking his head

"NO")

Yes.

GRETA

I ' m having a little trouble

following you. what do I say

to your mom?

FLETCHER

(RESIGNED)

Tell her I'm a thoughtless son

who'd rather spend ten hours

clogging the wheels of justice

than five minutes talking to

her-- but only if she asks.

You.might also add that she

deserves better, though I hope

to God you don't.

GRETA

Thanks for clearing that up.

And that's it, except your ex

called and asked when you were

cowing over to see your son.

FLETCHER

(REMEMBERS)

OHH! I'M SUCH A SHIT!!

FLETCHER

AUDREY--

AUDREY'

Hey, Fletcher. T was

wondering if you were going to

still pick up Max after school

today.

FLETCHER

I don't think I can. I had a

case I was certain would

settle and it didn't. I have

to go to trial this afternoon,

God help me.

AUDREY

(not believing

HIM)

Right.

FLETCHER

It's true... I really do want

to see Max, today.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

How about that. I really do.

AUDREY

(CYNICALLY)

But things keep coming up at

the last minute.

FLETCHER

Yes, but-this time it's

different.

AUDREY

I see. And how is that?

.

FLETCHER

( he walked into

IT)

This time I'm telling the

truth.

AUDREY

But last night you weren't?

FLETCHER

No.

AUDREY

What were you doing?

FLETCHER

Having sex.

AUDREY

(barely holding

her temper),

It must have been with someone

very "special."

FLETCHER

No. It was with someone I

don't even like. But I

thought it would help my

career and at the moment that

seemed more important than

attending my son's birthday!

A U D R EY

M y God!!

FLETCHER

A H H H H H H ! ! I WHAT IS WRONG WITH

ME I ! I

The Volvo parks.

Audrey gets out. She leans over to say good-bye to her

son.             ,                 .

MAX

Is dad picking me up?

AUDREY

No, I'm sorry, Max. He can't

make it. I will. I'll work

it out.

Max is disappointed.

MAX

I guess my wish didn't come

true.

AUDREY

What wish?

MAX

I wished that, for just one

day, Dad couldn't tell a lie.

Max heads toward his teacher. Audrey is deeply moved.

INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE

He's dialing the phone.

FLETCHER

Answer, answer, answer...

INTERCUT WITH AUDREY'S CAR

AUDREY

FLETCHER

When you gee there, stay

there. I'll be right over.

We have to talk.

AUDREY

FLETCHER--

FLETCHER

I'll be right- there!

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Aaaah!

MIRANDA

Flet cher. Fletcher, Fletcher,

Fletcher. I must confess--

after last night's incident, I

was. . . hurt. So hurt. I was

tempted to do whatever little

things lie in my power to

scuttle your chances of making

partner.

MIRANDA (CONT'D)

But then I thought, "No,

that 's not fair. Fletcher

didn't mean to insult me."

(STRAIGHTENING

his tie)

"It was just some massive,

boneheaded misunderstanding,

and Fletcher is very, very

sorry."

MIRANDA (CONT'D)

Isn't that right, Fletcher?

FLETCHER

(in agony)

Uh -- not really, no.

MIRANDA

(stunned, angry)

N o ? No?! What are you

sayi ng? Have you no respect

for me?!

FLETCHER

None, whatsoever. I mean, I ' d

like to respect you, and if it

weren't for your mistreatment

of the associates, your

rudeness to the staff, and the

fact that your work sucks, I

would.

M IRANDA

But -- what about last night?

FLETCHER

I was afraid you wouldn't

support my partnership if I

turned you down. Plus, I have

an immature need for sexual

conquests.

FLETCHER

Gotta focus. . . gotta focus.

FLETCHER

The color of the pen is --

re d !      .

DRIVER

What's your problem, schmuck?!

FLETCHER

(the truth)

I ' m an inconsiderate prick!

Fletcher once again focuses on the blue pen.

FLETCHER (CON "ID)

C'mon, you can do this! The

color of the pen is -- RED!

This time he's referring to the flashing red light of a

POLICE CAR in his rearview mirror.

FLETC HER

S hi t !!

Fletcher pulls over. A POLICE OFFICER strolls up.

POLICE OFFICER

Do you know why I stopped you?

FLETCHER

Depends on how long you were

following me.

POLICE OFFICER

Why don't we take it from the

top.

FLETCHER

(in agony)

Here goes -- I didn't fasten

my seatbelt, I didn't glance

in my rearview mirror, I

didn't signal when I pulled

away from the curb, I sped, I

followed too closely, I ran a

stop sign, I almost hit :a

Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a

ge ezer, I sped some more, I

failed to yield at a

crosswalk, I changed lanes in

the intersection, I changed

lanes without signalling, and

I changed lanes in the

INTERSECTION-WITHOUT

signalling while running a red

light and speeding.

POLICE OFFICER

May I see your driver's

license?

FLETCHER

No.

POLICE OFFICER

And why is that?

FLETCHER

It's in my other pants.

POLICE OFFICER

I see. And where are your

other pants?

FLETCHER

Hanging from my boss's

credenza.

POLICE OFFICER

Do you expect me to believe

that?

FLETCHER

No.

POLICE OFFICER

Do you think I'm an idiot?

FLETCHER

Yes -- but that's beside the

point! My license actually is

in my other pants, and they

actually were hanging from a

credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to

you! I mean, I would if I

could, but I can't!

POLICE OFFICER

I see. So you ..have no reason

to try and hide your license

from me?

FLETCHER

I didn't say that. I have

other reasons. Seventeen

reasons, to be precise.

(begrudgingly,

off the

officer's look)

Unpaid parking tickets.

(BESEECHINGLY)

Be gentle.

FLETCHER

Audrey, wait!

AUDREY

Wait? You know, I just had an

insight into myself. I ' m

crazy. You call me up and .

tell me to wait here because

you'll be right over and --

here's the crazy part -- I

actually wait.

FLETCHER

I can explain--

AUDREY

I missed a department meeting.

I. . . Did you come in a cab?

FLETCHER

Yes.

AUDREY

Where's your car?

FLETCHER

Thank you. . I can't tell you

how much this means to me.

AUDREY

I can. One thousand, six

hundred, and fifty-four

dollars and eleven cents.

FLETCHER

Ow.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

You scratched my car!

TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE

Where?     .

FLETCHER

Right there!

TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE

Oh that? That was already

there.

FLETCHER

(OUTRAGED)

Why, you -- you liar! Do you

know what I ' m going to do

about this?

TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE

What?

FLETCHER

(angrier and

ANGRIER)

...Nothing! Because if I take

you to small-claims court, it

will just drain eight hours

out of my life, and you

probably won't show up, and if

I finally got the judgment

you'd just stiff me anyway, so

what I'm gonna do is piss and

moan like an impotent jerk and

. then bend over and take it up

the tail pipe!

TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE

You've been here before,

haven't you?

AUDREY

Well I can't remember when

I've had more fun, now if

you'll excuse me, I have a

class.

FLETCHER

Audrey, wait. I want to talk

to you about this Boston

situation.

. AUDREY

What do you want to say?

FLETCHER

You can't go. It's not fair.

Taking Max three thousand

miles away is not fair.

AUDREY

Let' s define "fair." Last

night a five-year old boy was

crushed because his father

lied to him about coming to

his birthday party. Fair?

FLETCHER

Last night--

AUDREY

-- Was none of my business.

When it happened two years ago

it was my business, but now I

don't have to care anymore.

See, that's the magic of

div orce . But it does matter

to Max. Everything you do

matters to him... and

everything you don't do.

FLETCHER

All right-- now let me tell

you something...you're

absolutely right. I'm guilty

of all charges. I'm throwing

myself on the mercy of your

-court.

FLETCHER {CONT'D)

I have an idea. I'll come

over tonight, right after

court lets out and play with

M ax. Have him invite some

fri ends over. We'll have a

game and everything. Then,

you and I can sit down and

talk.

AUDREY

We're suppose to be on a plane

TONIGHT--

FLETCHER

No, Audrey. Just talk to me

abou t this first. Please.

Au drey, I've lost you. Don't

make me lose Max, too.

AUDREY

You're really coming?

FLETCHER

This is iron-clad. This is

the mother of all promises.

What time?

AUDREY

...Six?

FLETCHER

Ten-to-six.

AU DR EY

(UNSURE)

All right... only if I tell

Max you're coming and you

don't show up and I have to

see that look on Max's face --

that heartbreaking look-- it's

Boston, Fletcher.

FLETCHER.

I will be there.

AUDREY

I hope so. Do you know what

your son was doing at nine-

fif teen las t ni ght? He was

making a wish on his birthday

c ake. He was wishing that,

for just one day, his dad

couldn't tell a lie.

FLETCHER

Oh my God! That-'s it! An

innocent kid - - a heartfelt

plea-- a birthday wish! Sure,

it' s impossible --but it

'makes sense!..! If he can wish

it, he can unwish it!

MAX

Dad!

MS . BERRY

Are you Max's dad? I ' m Ms.

Berry, Max's teacher!

FLETCHER

Hi. Listen, I need to talk to

MAX--

MS. BERRY

Mr. Reid, we were just talking

ab ou t careers. You're a

lawyer, aren't you?

FLETCHER

(WARY)

Yes.

MAX

Mr. Reid it'would be wonderful

for the children to hear

something positive about

lawyers!

FLETCHER

Well, actually--

MS. BERRY

Children! .Mr. Reid is going

to tell us what it's like to

be a lawyer.

FLETCHER

Uh, hi. Uh, I'm a lawyer and

I work at a big law firm with

a lot of other lawyers and I

do stuff in a law court.

Thank you.

MS. BERRY

One moment, Mr. Reid. Maybe

some of the children have

QUESTIONS

(hands shoot up)

Jeffrey?

JEFF

What kind of lawyer are you?

FLETCHER

Mostly, I ' m a divorce lawyer.

BILLY

What's that?

FLETCHER

It means if you're daddy left

your mommy, he'd call me.

CRAIG

So what do you do?

FLETCHER

(growing more and

more impatient)

I help people fight over their

money and their children.

THEODORE

Can't they fight without you?

FLETCHER ' "

They could but then J wouldn't

make a living.

JILL

Why would my daddy leave my

mommy?

FLETCHER

To marry a younger woman. To

escape a loveless marriage and

have cheap meaningless sex.

To cling to an illusion of

youth as his body gives way to

sore backs, flat feet, spare

tires, gum disease, hair loss,

liver spots, kidney stones,

clogged arteries, diabetes,

goiter and eventual death.

MS. BERRY

(BRIGHTLY)

Well, I think it's time for

fingerpainting.

FLETCHER

Monster-Max.

MAX

Dadzilla. You came to play

catch?

FLETCHER

No. I ' d like to, but I can't

right now.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

I ' m sorry I missed your party

la st night. How was your

Uncle Glen?

MAX

Stupid. His big nose and

stupid orange hair...

FLETCHER

That's why he should have worn

make-up.

'       MAX .

I want to play kickball with

my friends.-

FLETCHER

Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother

told me about... the wish you

made last night. It came

true.

MAX

Really? You mean you have to

tell the truth?

FLETCHER

Yes.

MAX

No matter what?

FLETCHER

No matter what.

MAX

Is wrestling real?

FLETCHER

In the Olympics, yes.      On    .

Channel 23, no.

MAX

Will sitting close to the TV

set make me go blind?

FLETCHER

Not in a million years.

MAX

If I keep making this face--

(makes a horrible

FACE)

will it get stuck that way?

FLETCHER

Uh-uh.

MAX

.If I go in the water right

after lunch, will I drown?

FLETCHER

Only if you can't 'swim.

MAX

Why do I have to eat squash?

FLETCHER

Because your mom buys it.

MAX

How come you're always too

busy to play with me?

FLETCHER

I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey,

you know I'm coming over

to nig ht. We're gonna play

together.

MAX

Baseball?

FLETCHER

. Yes! This is absolutely an

A-number one promise. You and

I -- tonight -- baseball.

FLETCHER

Now, listen, Max, I need a

favor from you. I ' m in a

little trouble today. I need

you to take that wish back.

MAX

So you can lie?

FLETCHER

Not to you.

MAX

To who?

FLETCHER

Max, sometimes grownups...

need to lie. It's hard to

explain, but i f . . . Look,

here's an example. When Mommy

was pregnant with you, she

gained a little weight.

Se venty pounds. I thought she

was gonna give birth to a car.

But she'd say to me "How do I

lo ok?" So I'd say, "Oh,

honey, you're beautiful,

you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I

would've hurt Mommy's

fee ling s. Understand?

MAX

You didn't think she was

beautiful.

FLETCHER

Right. No... Max, I don't

know how to get along in the

grown-up world if I have to

stick to the truth. I could

lose my case, I could lose my

promotion, I could even lose,

my job... Do you understand?

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Will you help me anyway?

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

That's my boy!

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Now, do whatever you did last

night... only this time, make

an un-wish.

MAX

I did it. ^

FLETCHER

Great! Great! Now to test --

MAX

Did it work?

FLETCHER            .       .

(rubbing his sore

CHEEK)

Not like I ' d hoped. Did you

really unwish it?

MAX

Only...

FLETCHER

Only what?

MAX

Yesterday, when I wished it, I

r ea lly meant it. This time

when I unwished it I only did

it 'cause you told me to.

FLETCHER

(losing patience)

Well, then do it again.        Only

this time, mean it.

MAX

I can't.

FLETCHER

Why not?!

MAX

Because I don't want you to

lie.

FLETCHER

I explained this to you! I

have to lie. Everybody lies!

Mommy lies, even the wonderful

Jerry lies--

'

MAX

But you're the only one who

makes me feel bad.

.    '   .

MS. BERRY

(CALLING)

Max, recess 'is over, come on

in.

MAX

I have to go.

FLETCHER

I am coming over, tonight,

Max. You believe me, don't

you?

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

I'll see you tonight, buddy...

That's a promise.

MACHO ATTORNEY

Yo, Fletcher! How's it

hanging?

FLETCHER

Short and shrivelled.

PHILIP

Fletcher! I'm still waiting

for your call. I guess you

must've lost my card --

FLETCHER

No --

PHILIP

Or my phone was busy --

FLETCHER

No --

PHILIP

Or you just forgot --

FLETCHER

No --

PHILIP

(cannot be

DISCOURAGED)

Or something. So anyway,' why

don't you swing by my place

around seven-thirty!

FLETCHER

Philip... I don't want to come

over to your house!

PHILIP

Fi n e ! We'll go out! There's

this new karaoke bar I've been

dying to try. I'll pick you

up at your office! Seven-

thirty! !

GRETA

Do you want your messages?

FLETCHER

No.

GRETA

Are you okay?

FLETCHER

My son hates me.

GRETA

No! He loves you. I've seen

y ou together. You're his

hero.

FLETCHER

O h yeah? Last night at his

birthday party, he made a

wish. That I wouldn't be able

to tell a lie for one whole

day.

GRETA

Kids...

FLETCHER

It came true.

GRETA

What?

FLETCHER

It's true. Didn't it seem odd

to you that I kept telling the

truth all morning?

GRETA

Well, yeah, but...

(INCREDULOUS)

You're telling me that you

can't lie.

FLETCHER

That's right!     I am incapable

of lying.

GRETA

Just today?

FLETCHER

Apparently until 9:15 tonight.

It's a twenty-four hour curse.

GRETA

Yes, those are going around.

FLETCHER

You don't believe me.

GRETA

Of course not.

FLETCHER

Go ahead. Ask me something

I ' d normally lie about.

GRETA

A ll right. Remember a few

months ago, I wanted a raise--

FLETCHER

(QUICKLY)

Forget it. Let's not do this.

GRETA

-- and the firm wouldn't.give

me one. And I asked you if

you would give it to me out of

your own pocket and you said

the company wouldn't permit it

because it creates jealousy

among the other secretaries?

Was that true or did you just

not want to pony up the dough?

FLETCHER

Greta, please...

(into phone)

Yes Judge Stevens, hi!..

Fletcher Reid. I ' m scheduled

to be in your court in half-

an-hour... Judge Stevens, I

badly, badly need a

continuance. . . so I can go

home and stay there the rest

of the day...111? Am I ill?

FLETCHER

In a way.

(covers the

MOUTHPIECE)

Please, lie to him for me.

GRETA

I remember when you. bought me

t hi s silver frame. From

Tiffany's.

(QUESTIONING)

. . . Tiffany's?

FLETCHER

Jumbo's House of Junk.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

I'll give you the raise!

GRETA

(gives him the

FINGER)

Here's your raise.

FLETCHER

(into phone)

Hi, Judge Stevens?... Yes, I

know I haven't given you a

reason.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

(into phone)

But if you could just do this

for me, I--

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Hold on, please,

(pushes two

BUTTONS)

Hello... Mom!!

FLETCHER {CONT'D)

Mom... Well, I wasn't actually

on vacation... Because I

didn't want to talk to you...

Because you insist on talking

to me about Dad's bowel

movements -- size, color,

frequency... I'll call you

later... No, not really.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Oh dammit! I cut him off! I

cut off the Judge! Greta...

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

I'm on my knees in a nine

hundred dollar suit. Don't

leave.

GRETA

A few years ago a friend of

mine had a burglar up on her

roof.

FLETCHER

Yes?

GRETA            ..

A burglar. -He fell through

the kitchen skylight and

landed on a cutting board on a

butcher's knife, cutting his

l e g. He sued my friend. The

burglar sued my friend.

Thanks to guys like you-- he

won. My friend had to pay him

six thousand dollars. Is that

justice?

FLETCHER

No. . . but what' s your poijit!

GRETA

My point is, it's hard to get

justice. But this is justice,

(pinches his

CHEEK)

Have a nice day in court,

bubbie.

FLETCHER

GRETA--

FLETCHER

Aaaah!

MIRANDA

Ah, Fletcher, so nice to bump

i nto you. Are you busy?

FLETCHER

Extremely.

MIRANDA

Good. Would you follow me,

please?

MIRANDA (CONT'D)

Fletcher, did you know that

the partnership committee is

being headed up by Mr. Allan

himself?

(off his wary

NOD)

Say, you used to work directly

for Mr. Allan, didn't you?

(off his waried

NOD)

Tell me, what do you think of

him?

FLETCHER

(HELPLESS)

He's a pedantic,

pontificating, pretentious

bastard, a belligerent old

fart, a worthless, steaming

pile of cow dung.

MIRANDA

(GRINNING)

How delightful!

MIRANDA

Pardon me for interrupting

your, meeting. Mr. Allan, you

remember Fletcher Reid.

MR. ALLAN

It's good to see you again,

Fletcher. '.

MIRANDA

Oh, that's right. You used to

work together. .Tell me, what

do you think of Mr. Allah?

MIRANDA

I said... What do you think of

Mr. Allan?

FLETCHER     .

He's a pedantic,

pontificating, pretentious

bastard, a belligerent old

fart, a worthless, steaming

pile of cow dung.

MR. ALLAN

Marvelous! Marvelous! That's

what I love most about this

firm-- the collegial

atmosphere, the hearty good-

fellowship!

MR. ALLAN (CONT'D)

And thanks for those flowers

for my anniversary. My wife

loved them.

FLETCHER

Well, I'm due in court... bye-

bye.

BAILIFF

All rise.

JUDGE STEVENS

Counselors, are we ready to

begin?

FLETCHER

(eagerly and a

little too

LOUDLY)

N o sir! We are not ready to

b eg in. My client has not

arrived.

FLETCHER         .

--   until now.

(to Falk, with

DETERMINATION)

Did you and Mrs. Cole ever

make lo-- forni-- roll in the

VIRGINIA

Wate r! Get him water!

FLETCHER

Fu-- fu--

VIRGINIA

S it down! Get some air!

(slaps him on the

BACK)

Try to relax! Breathe deeply!

VIRGINIA (CONT'D)

W hat?!   What?!

FALK

I couldn't find any water, so

I got him coffee!

BAILIFF

Judge is taking the bench.

JUDGE STEVENS

You may proceed, Mr. Reid. .

VIRGINIA

Sorry. One of the kids threw

up in the car.

FLETCHER

(INCREDULOUS

WHISPER)

You brought your kids. . . to

your divorce?

VIRGINIA

(by way of

EXPLANATION)

Sympathy.

FLETCHER

Well, it's working. I feel

sorry for them already.

JUDGE STEVENS

Ms. Appleton, you may begin.

CUT TO:

BRYSON

(referring to his

NOTES)

-- From March six through June

twelve, I surveilled Mrs. Cole

at the behest of Mr. Cole.

During that period, I noted

that Mr. Cole left each day

between seven-forty and seven-

fifty. Thereafter, Mrs. Cole

would frequently have a male

visitor arrive and stay for

one to four hours. I was able

to take several photographs of

the male visitor.

DANA

I see. And do you .know what

Mrs. Cole and her male visitor

did during their frequent...

visits?

BRYSON

Well, they were pretty good

about keeping the shades drawn

-- but I sure was able to

hear. I made an audiotape of

one such., "session."

DANA

With the Court's permission, I

would like to play the tape.

FLETCHER

Your Honor, I object!

JUDGE STEVENS

And why is that, Mr. Reid?

FLETCHER

(can't help

HIMSELF)

Because it's devastating to my

case.

JUDGE STEVENS

Overruled..

MALE VISITOR (O.S.)

So , what did you say? You

ready?

VIRGINIA (O.S.)

Oh boy am I ready.

MALE VISITOR (O.S.)

Good. Let me help you off

with that. Come on, lie down.

VIRGINIA (O.S.)

Wai t a minute. Do you have

protection?

MALE VISITOR ( O . S . )

Right here. Okay, now I ' m

gonna show you something new.

VIRGINIA ( O . S . )

Oh, I've never done it like

this before.                    ..

MALE VISITOR (O.S.)

Don't worry, you can take it.

Oh yeah. That's it. There

you go. Yes! Yes!

MALE VISITOR (O.S) (CONT'D)

Yes, yes, yes --

MALE VISITOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Oh yeah, bring it on .home --

yes! Yes! Yes!

VIRGINIA (O.S.)

Yes! YES! YES!

DANA

Your witness.

FLETCHER

No questions.

JUDGE STEVENS

No questions? .

VIRGINIA

No questions?

FLETCHER

(afraid to ask

ANY)

No questions.

DANA

(TRIUMPHANT)

Petitioner rests.

JUDGE STEVENS

All right, Mr. Reid. You may

proceed.

FLETCHER

(to himself)

How?!

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Would the Court be willing to

grant me a short bathroom

break?

JUDGE STEVENS

It can't wait?

FLETCHER

Not unless you want to mop up.

JUDGE STEVENS

(FRUSTRATED)

All right, but get back in

here immediately so .we can

finish this.

FLETCHER

What did I think? That I

could piss for forty-five

minutes?!

MAN

What's going on in-there?

FLETCHER (O . S . )

I ' m abusing myself! Do you

mind?!

BAILIFF

I found him like this in the

bathroom. Somebody beat the

hell out of him.

JUDGE STEVENS

Who did this?

FLETCHER

(TRUTHFULLY)

A madman, Your Honor.. A

desperate fool at the end of

his pitiful.rope.

JUDGE STEVENS

-What did he look like?

FLETCHER

(DESCRIBING

HIMSELF)

About five eleven, hundred

eighty-five pounds, crazed

look in his eye.

JUDGE STEVENS

Bailiff, have the deputies

search the building.

JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)

Under the circumstances, I

have no choice but to recess

this case until tomorrow

morning at nine.

JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)

-- Unless, of course, you

think you can still proceed?

JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)

Can you?

FLETCHER

Yes, I can.

JUDGE STEVENS

Splendid. I admire your

courage, Mr. Reid. I'll give

you a few minutes to compose

yourself, and then we'll get

started.

FLETCHER

Hello.

MAX

Dad...

FLETCHER

(summoning up

ENTHUSIASM)

Maxi-pad. How's it going?

MAX

Great. You know Paul and

Emanuel from across the

street?

FLETCHER

The twins.

MAX .

(EXCITEDLY)

Well, they never want to play

baseball with me, but I told

them I was gonna play tonight

with my Dad, so now they want

to play with us. Is it okay?

FLETCHER

Sure.

MAX

Oh boy. We're setting up a

whole field in the yard.

Where we buried Petey the

hamster is second base.

(Fletcher sighs)

You're still coming right?'

FLETCHER

(sees Virginia

APPROACHING)

I'11 be there. I gotta go

now, Max. I'll see you in two

hours.

MAX

(to Audrey)

He's really coming.

VIRGINIA

Mr. Reid, you remember

Laurence Falk, the man from

the tape.

FALK

How are you?

FLETCHER

I've slipped into the seventh

circle of Hell, thank you, and

you?

VIRGINIA

Shouldn't we go over our

testimony?

FLETCHER

Well, basically the plan is I

walk you through the tape step

by step, I ask you questions--

VIRGINIA

And we give the explanation

you came up with.

FLETCHER

Exactly.

FALK

So all we have to do is lie.

Sounds simple enough.

FLETCHER

Do esn't it? And I'll finish

up with a dramatic series of

questions, something like...

"Mr. Falk, isn't it true that

you and Mrs. Cole have never

made lo--"

FLETHCER (CONT'D)

Sorry. I'm fine. "Mr. Falk,

isn't it true that you and

Mrs. Cole have never made lo--

IO-.H

FLETCHER

(to himself)

Oh my God! I can't do it! I

can't finish the question if I

know the answer is a lie!

MR. ALLAN

Don't let me interrupt,

Fletcher. I just want you to

know I'll be observing this

a fternoon. Miranda insisted I

see you in action.

MR. ALLAN (CONT'D)

I'm looking forward to it. Go

get 'em!

FLETCHER

C'mon! Gotta rephrase the

question!

FLETCHER

Respondent calls... Lawrence

Falk.

Fletcher's clears his throat.       Here goes...

FLETCHER

Mr. Falk, do you know my

client, Virginia Cole?

FALK

Yes.

FLETCHER

Isn't it true that your

relationship with my client is

entirely platonic, not?

The "not" was INVOLUNTARY.       It takes everyone by surprise.

FALK

Excuse me?

FLETCHER

If I might rephrase your

Honor.

(trying again)

Is your relationship with my

client entirely patonic, not?

Is your relationship with my

client not entirely platonic?

Is not your relationship with

my client entirely platonic?

(thinks he's got

it, beams with

CONFIDENCE)

Mr. Falk, is not your

relationship with my client

entirely platonic?

FALK

(CONFUSED)

No.     I mean, yes.     I think.

FLETCHER

Yes, is your relationship with

my client not entirely

platonic, or yes, is not your

relationship with my client

entirely platonic?

FALK

What?

FLETCHER

How 'bout just answering the

question you think I'm asking?              '

DANA

Your Honor, he's badgering the

wintness!

JUDGE STEVENS

It's hig witness!

FLETCHER

Did you ever not make lo--

Did you not ever make lo--

(losing it)

YOU HAD SEX WITH HER EVERYTIME

YOU MET, DIDN'T YOU? DIDN'T

YOU?!!

FLETCHER

(screaming at

HIM)

ADMIT IT! YOU .SLAMMED HER!!

YOU STOKED THE FUR FIRE! YOU

-DID THE YAM DANCE! !

FALK

(breaking down)

YES, YES,-- IT'S TRUE! I

HUMPED HER. BRAINS OUT! !

FLETCHER

(WEAKLY)

No further questions.

DANA

Uh...no questions.

JUDGE STEVENS

(to Fletcher)

Call your next witness.

FLETCHER

I have no further witnesses,

your Honor.

JUDGE STEVENS

You have no further

witnesses?!

VIRGINIA

(whispers, to

FLETCHER)

What are you doing? Call me.

FLETCHER

(to Virginia)

I can't.

JUDGE STEVENS

Mr. Reid?

VIRGINIA

Call me, damn it!

FLETCHER

You don't understand. I can't

lie . Until nine-sixteen

tonight, I can't even.ask a

question that calls for a lie!

VIRG INIA

L is ten , you bastard. I want

m y money. I am not gonna wind

up a 31 year old divorce on

welfare because my scum bag

attorney had a sudden attack

of conscience!

FLETCHER

(to himself)

Thirty-one?

JUDGE STEVENS

Mr. Reid, we're not getting

any younger...

JUDGE STEVENS

(he's had it)

Mr. Reid you have presented

virtually nothing in the way

of evidence and as such I have

no choice but to rule in favor

of --

FLETCHER

WAIT!

FLETCHER      .

(DRAMATICALLY)

Your Honor, I call Virginia

Cole to the stand.

MR. ALLAN

(in the gallery)

What the hell is he doing?

MIRANDA

Kissing his career goodbye.

BALIFP

Do you swear to tell the

truth, the whole truth and

nothing but the truth, so help

-you God?

VIRGINIA

I do.

FLETCHER

Mrs. Cole -- may I call you

Virginia?

VIRGINIA

Yes.

FLETCHER

But that would be a lie,

wouldn't it?

VIRGINIA

What do you mean?

FLETCHER

Isn't your true name...

(BRANDISHING

PASSPORT)

Carlotta?!

VIRGINIA

Well, yes. But it wasn't me

so I started using Virginia.

Is there anything wrong with

that?

FLETCHER         .

Not really. It's just the

first and smallest in the

tissue of lies that is the

Kleenex of your life. Let's

take one simple document as a

sample of your veracity, shall

we, Carlotta?

F LETCHER

Your driver's license. What

color are your eyes?

VIRGINIA

Blue.

FLETCHER

Tru e blue? What if I asked

you to remove your contact

l enses? What color would they

be then?

VIRGINIA

(RELUCTANTLY)

Brown.

FLETCHER

And here it says you're a

b l on de . Are you?

(off her silence)

C'mon, Carlotta, there's a

very easy way for us to check.

If you don't remember, perhaps

Mr. Falk will.

VIRGINIA

Brunette.

FLETCH ER

More like a dirty brown, isn't

it?

THEM)

PRENUPTUAL AGREEMENTS! THANK

YOU VERY LITTLE! This

contract is void!!! The fact

that my client gets nailed

more often than a two-by-four

is irrelevant. Standard

community property applies and

this woman is entitled to half

of the marital assets or

thirty-seven point three-nine-

five million dollars!!

Nothing further, your Honor!

JUDGE STEVENS

(banging his

GAVEL)

Q uie t! Let me see-the license

and birth certificate.

JUDGE STEVENS

In light of this new evidence,

the court must rule in favor

o f the defense. Mrs. Cole is

hereby awarded half of the

marital assets -or thirtyrseven

million three hundred and

ninety-five thousand dollars.

MR. ALLAN

That son of bitch pulled it

off!

JUDGE STEVENS

O r d e r ! Order!! Now i

understand both parties have

agreed to joint custody. Is

that correct?

FLETCHER AND DANA

YES--

VIRGINIA

No!   I'm contesting custody.

FLETCHER

What?

VIRGINIA

(re: her husband)

Payback. For him trying to

prevent me from collecting my

thirty-seven million.

FLETCHER

He was entitled to prevent

you. You committed adultery.'

You only won because you're a

liar, remember? .

VIRGINIA

No. You pointed out that my

husband took advantage of a

poor underage girl. I was the

vic tim here. And now I'm

going to hit him where it

hurts.

FLETCHER

But -- but -- you said he was

a good father.

JUDGE STEVENS

M r. Reid? Do we have an

agreement on custody or not?

FLETCHER

No.                                            .

JUDGE STEVENS

In that case, there will be a

custody hearing tomorrow

mor ning at nine. Court is

adj ourned!

VIRGINIA

Stop that! We're leaving now!

CHILD

I want to go with Daddy.

Fletcher watches, horrified, as she drags the kids away

from their tearful father.

MR. COLE

Don't worry. I'll see you no

matter what. I promise.

Mr. Allan has made his way up to Fletcher.

MR. ALLAN

(re: the

COMMOTION)

I love kids. They give you so

much leverage in a case like

this.

(pats Fletcher on

BACK)

Congratulations, partner. how

does it feel?

And with that question asked, as he watches poor Mr. Cole

and his kids, the truth dawns on Fletcher like a

sledgehammer!

FLETCHER '

Excuse me. Just a second.

(to the Judge)

Y our Honor? Your Honor?

Wait!

JUDGE STEVENS

We',re adjourned, Mr. Reid.

FLETCHER

Screw that!! She lies and she

wins ?! What are we, nuts?

Everyone stops, watches Fletcher.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)

T his woman --my client --

goes down with the frequency

of a nuclear submarine and we

just gave her thirty seven

million dollars because she's

a liar! And now as an extra

added little bonus, we're

going to let her steal, the

kids, too?

JUDGE STEVENS

Mr. Reid, you are out of

order!

FLETCHER

(SCREAMING)

SO'S THE HAND DRYER IN THE

MEN'S ROOM!! Do you ever stop

to ask yourself, why do people

hate us? Could it be because

what we did here today sucks?!

We don't care about the truth!

We don't want to find the

t r u th ! We want to win! We

want to win at all costs...and

you know what the worst thing

about wanting to win so badly

i s ? WINNING! Winning and

finding out you're left with

nothing!

JUDGE STEVENS

That's enough, Mr. Reid --

FLETCHER

-Let' s see what I' ve done

today. I've helped a gold

digging slut get richer. I'm

taking this guy's kids away.

(to Mr. Allan)

I don't like you in the least,

now I'm one of your partners!

YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT IT FEELS

I don't like you. I'm sorry.

I find you boring. I hate

ch ara des . And you wouldn't

know a good time if it sat on

your face.

(feels bad)

I'm sorry. It was easier than

telling you how I really felt.

Are you upset?

PHILIP

No. To be honest, I don't

like you either. You treat

people like obstacles and you

cheat at charades. .

FLETCHER

Then why are you always trying

to socialize with me?

PHILIP

You're a client. I figured if

I didn't try to be your

friend, you'd get a new

accountant.

FLETCHER

Philip, I don't like you as a

person, but I'm crazy about

you as my accountant. I ' d

never hire a new accountant.

Never!

PHILIP

So we don't have to like each

other anymore?

FLETCHER    -

Not at all.

.              PHILIP

All right. Sooner I get you

to the airport, sooner I can

dump your sorry ass off.

FLETCHER

Bedelayed. Bedelayed. Fog,

rain, something, anything...

" F li g ht 69. Departs 7:50. On Time. Gate 17."

FLETCHER

Excuse me. . . excuse me. . . Come

on folks, let's let the

frantic man pass... Sorry...

Thank... you... Standing on

the right, passing on the

left. They can't make this-

deal any easier than it is...

Come on... coming through...

WOMAN

Help the poor?...

FLETCHER

(speeding past)

I don't trust you. I don't

know what the hell that

uniform is. Sorry.

(a Hare Krishna

tries to stop

HIM)

NOT NOW, TOGA BOY!

INSPECTOR

Please step through again.

FLETCHER

Ahhh!! !    Damn..;

FLETCHER

What? I'tii practically naked!

FLETCHER

It's called a ZIPPER, Hodgy...

FL E TC H ER

N ooo!!!

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Can I help you?

FLETCHER

Look out!! ! --

(TRUTHFUL)

-NOTHING'S COMING!!

WORKER

Hey!!      Hey!!!!

F LET CH ER

MA X ? !!   AUDREYY?!!

STEWARDESS

In case of a water landing,

please use your seat cushion

AS--

AUDREY

(checks under his

SEAT)

It's right here, honey.

M AX

Mom!   Mom!!               '

AUDREY

Just a second, Max.

MAX

Mom, it's dad!

AU DREY

W hat? What about dad?

AUDREY

Fletcher?!

CUT TO:

FLETCHER

(mumbles to

HIMSELF)

Oh boy, the truth hurts.   Yes

indeed.

DEPUTY

Mr. Reid. Someone made bail

for you.

FLETCHER

(WEAKLY)

Greta? Is that you?

FLETCHER

(to Audrey and

Jerry, trying to

seem chipper)

Sorry I made you miss your

flight, not really.

(no response)

You're obviously a little

. upset, not that I blame you...

although I'll bet you'll still

get the bonus miles. . .

AUDREY

Fletcher, are you crazy?

What were you doing?

FLETC HER

That's two questions. A; Yes,

but I think the legal term is

temporarily insane. And B; I

was trying to finally have

that talk with you about

Boston.

FLETCHER

Okay, okay... The whole truth

and nothing but the truth,

(with difficulty,

SINCERELY)

I tried to stop the plane

because it was taking off with

my life... you and Max.

FLETCHER

I know you've met somebody...

somebody pretty great... and

the truth is I wish you didn't

but you did and... All I ' m

asking i s . . . Please don't move

to Boston. Please don't take

Max away.

AUDREY

You can come visit anytime.

It's only a four hour flight.

FLETCHER

I don't want to visit him.

That's what I've been doing--

visiting him, dropping by,

stopping in. I want to be in

his life. I don't want to be

some jerk that sees him at

Easter. I want to be his

father.

FLETCHER

I know I have no right to ask,

but can I talk you out of

taki ng that job? I can get

you a better job here in L.A.

I've got all kinds of

connect ions... what do you do

again?

JERRY

I design security systems.

FLETCHER

How symbolic. Okay great.

You know Pac-Tec?

JERRY

The biggest.

FLETCHER

One of their systems shorted

out and burned down a

supermarket. I got them off.

Another proud day for justice.

If I ask them they'll beat

your Boston offer in two

s ec on ds .    ..

AUDREY

Don't put Jerry in the middle.

JERRY

It's okay.

(to Fletcher)

Boston means this

(snaps his

FINGERS)

to me. All I want is for this

lady and Max to be happy.

Preferably, with me. Whatever

they want, I'll go along with.

AUDREY

All I want is for Max to be

happy.

AUDREY

You better know your jury.

You're hot exactly Max's hero

today.

FLETCHER

Just let me present my case.

FLETCHER/TERMINATOR

I have been sent from the

future to destroy you. . .

Argghhh!

(no response, a

BEAT)

You mad at me?

FLETCHER

You wanted me to stop lying.

But lying isn't the problem. ..

Why we lie ~ that's the

problem. Sometimes we lie to

make someone else feel better.

But sometimes we lie because

the truth gets in our way...

(touches him)

But being an adult means you

sacrifice some things for more

important things. Much more

important things. I was so

stupid, Max.

(pointing to his

own head)

Malfunction in vector one.

All this time you've been here

and I could see you anytime I

felt like it. And I...

didn't. Please don't go to

Boston. Max, I love you more

than anything else in the

world and you know it's true.

I couldn't say it if it

weren't true. Not today.

MAX

(to Audrey)

He's telling the truth, Mom.

He's not allowed to lie. I

made a wish and anything Dad

says has to be the truth.

(to Fletcher) ..

Right?

FLETCHER

Max. .. it's 9:22.

AUDREY

What?

FLETCHER

Max, you made the wish at

9:15. I've been able to lie

for the last seven minutes.

MAX

So then, you were...

FLETCHER

No! It wasn't a lie. I just

wanted to be honest with you

and tell you -- there was no

wish to guarantee it anymore.

You just have to believe me.

MAX

(to Audrey)

Mommy... do we have to go to

Boston?

AUDR EY

No.      We don't have to.

MAX

(to Fletcher)

Can we play catch tomorrow?

M AX

Dad! !

FLETCH ER

Ma x i mu m ! !

MAX

Transformer!!! .

FLETCHER

Malfunction in vector seven.

I have lost control of my

affection reflex...

FLETCHER

Procreate!          Procreate!

AUDREY

(PLAYFULLY)

Fletcher... You're gonna lose

a limb--

MAX

Come on, dad, let's play

catch!!

FLETCHER

Sr. . .

UE

(starts to toss

MAX)

Here you go, mom.

(Max screams)

Oh, you mean with a ball...

FLETCHER

I take back every dirty,

dishonest thing I ever said

about you, wrote about you,

faxed about you, E-mailed

about you.

JERRY

Appreciated.

FLETCHER

So, you up for a little

friendly competition?

JERRY

No, you go play with your son.

FLETCHER

I wasn't talking about

basesball.

FLETCHER

(to Max)

Alright, it's time to show you

the old Fletcher Reid change up.

THE END
