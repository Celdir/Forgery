Wow ...

You want it?

Is it yours?

BUM

No.  Not mine.  Yours.

How much do you want for it?

Whatever you think its worth.

JOEY

It's a mystery to me ...

JOEY

Most nights this inner-city Emergency

Room would be a chaos of blood and panic

and grace under pressure.  But tonight,

as you see, it's like Death took a

holiday.  It's a mystery to me ... A

mystery how those assholes at

Assignments knew it.  This is Joey

Summerskill for W-QQY.  Emergency Room.

No story.  Really, really pissed off.

JOEY

Ah, break it down, Doc.  It's a bust.

- to reveal that we are not watching a broadcast at all but

5

NURSE

She can talk like this on television?

She can say this thing?  This assholes?

DOC

No sweat, sweetheart.  It's for the

European satellite ....  Joey; rein it

in, kid.  They couldn't've known.

JOEY

I know.  I know.  But it's just so ...

neat, isn't it?  The first gig that

isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's

taken away from me.

DOC

Yeah, well like you said - it's a

mystery.  But that's all it is.

Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think

the station paid off every accident

victim in the city to ... ?

DOC

Speak.

CELLPHONE

Doc.  24th and Cedar.  Fast.  Hostage

situation.

DOC

OK.  Listen - Joey's here.  Shall ...

CELLPHONE

No need.  Martin's already there.

Hurry.  You've got ambulances to beat.

6

JOEY

Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With

a real reporter.

DOC

Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can

go by your place.

JOEY

You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll

catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry

about it.  Go.

DOC

OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story

of your life could be right round the

corner.

JOEY

That is the story of my life.

7

TERRI

It wasn't my fault.  It wasn't my fault.

PARAMEDIC 1

10 milligram IV Valium stat.  How the

fuck did this happen ... ?!

TERRI

It was outside.  I wasn't even with him.

PARAMEDIC 2

You ever see anything like this before?

TERRI

He must have stolen it.

JOEY

What's going on?

PARAMEDIC 1

Yeah, sure.  Five times a fucking day.

Just push!

TERRI

It was off the statue.  In the club.

JOEY

What happened to him?

PARAMEDIC 2

Think they'll get him back?

8

TERRI

It's nothing to do with me.

PARAMEDIC 1

Worst case of status I've seen.  Even

money at best.

JOEY

Wait!  I'm a reporter!  Tell me where he

was ...

JOEY

Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need

talk to you.

TERRI

(over her shoulder)

It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't

even with him.

TERRI

Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my

problem!  I was just there!

JOEY

Where?

9

TERRI

Under The Underground.  Can I like GO

now?!

JOEY

Under the Underground?  What's that?

Where is ...

- is on the floor, as if flung there by some powerful force.

- is cowering behind a mobile tray of surgical instruments,

- are flattened against the far wall, terror on their faces.

10

DOCTOR

Who's that?  Get her out of here!

- as Joey backs away, an expression of numbed shock on her

- still arcing.

- glancing at the light from her seat.

11

- her face, lit by reflected store-signs and street-lights, is

BRAD

(over)

See?  This is what I mean.  Your

technique is all wrong.

JOEY

(guardedly)

What do you mean?

BRAD

I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling

you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on

the leg-cross ... and you're made.

JOEY

Fuck you.

12

BRAD

What, you think I'm kidding?  I

guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys

upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an

anchor-woman.

JOEY

(to herself)

Jesus Christ ...

DOC

Ah, give her a break.

BRAD

(to Doc)

What's with you?

BRAD

C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help

you hit a home run here.

JOEY

Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It

may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I

want to do it the right way.  Not tight

skirts.  Tight stories.

BRAD

Right.  Like last night's doozie.

JOEY

I know what I saw.

BRAD

And I believe what you say.  But this is

TV.  No pictures, no story.

DOC

Yeah, too bad I had to go and ...

BRAD

... and cover something on Planet Earth.

See, you gotta remember, Joey; this is a

LOCAL station.  As in local to this

galaxy.

JOEY

There's a story out there.

13

BRAD

(jumping in warningly)

Not on station time.

JOEY

No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My

time.

BRAD

Lot of attitude there, Doc ...

BRAD

... but great legs.

- catches sight of a blonde figure moving across the dance

- as Joey pushes to the counter and hands the card to a BARMAN

- as Joey makes her way out.

SOLDIER 1

(off)

Call for a Medi-Vac!

SOLDIER 2

Don't die, man!  Don't fucking die!

- favoring the luminous display of an alarm clock next to the

JOEY

(off. Sleepily)

God.  This better be birth, marriage, or

death ...

- as she picks up the handset and puts it to her ear.

JOEY

Uh-huh?

TERRI

(on phone)

Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne

Summerskill?

JOEY

Joey.  Yeah, who is this?

17

TERRI

You like ... left me a card?  At the

club?

JOEY

Right.  Right!

TERRI

Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?

JOEY

I want to talk to you.  We met ... now,

listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at

the hospital last night.

TERRI

Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll

make a deal with you ... My boyfriend

threw me out, right?  I'll trade you.

You give me couch-space.  I'll give you

talk.  OK?

JOEY

Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?

TERRI

(Surprised at Joey's surprise.

Bit of a culture clash here)

Of course tonight.  Is that a problem?

Like, if you've got a guy there or

something ...

JOEY

No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was

having bad dreams anyway.

TERRI

Hi.  How're you doing?

18

- as Terri walks past the dressing-gowned Joey and heads

TERRI

You got anything to drink?

JOEY

I put some decaf on.  Er ... make

yourself comfortable.

TERRI

Right.

- having finished her quick examination, she calls out.

TERRI

So ... what was your bad dream?

JOEY

What?

TERRI

Your dream.  You said you were having a

bad dream.

JOEY

Oh yeah ...

19

JOEY

... well, I've been having it for years.

It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's

... well, I know what it is.

TERRI

What is it?

JOEY

Why are you so interested?

TERRI

Sorry.

JOEY

No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.

TERRI

(sympathetic, knowing)

Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?

JOEY

God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he

died before I was born.  He died in

Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met

him.  We don't even know the details.  I

dream of battlefields.  Of searching.

Of trying to find out.

TERRI

That's great.

JOEY

What?

TERRI

No ... I mean, it's not like great about

your dad or anything.  It's just I don't

dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help

if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ...

No, so it's always neat for me to hear

about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like

everybody has another world except me.

You know what I mean?

JOEY

I know what you're saying but ... Never?

You've never had a dream?  No, you know,

you do.  You must.  What you mean is you

don't remember them.

20

TERRI

Whatever.  All I know is - this is it

for me.  Just me, my bag, and a series

of shithead boyfriends.  It'd be good to

see something else.  Have a nighttime

life.  Be somebody different.

TERRI

Hey ... this is great, isn't it?  Just

girls talking.  Like having a

conversation?  Good coffee.  You got a

cigarette?

JOEY

Uh ...  yeah.  Yeah, somewhere.  Wait a

minute.

TERRI

Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?

JOEY

I'm trying to quit.

TERRI

Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You

think you're going to live forever?

JOEY

Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's

temperamental.

TERRI

It's okay.  It's just someone burned me

once.

21

TERRI

Wanna know how I look at it?  Way I see

it is ... you give up, right?  Three

days later, you get hit by a fucking

truck and you know - you just KNOW

that your last thought as you go under

those wheels'd be "Jesus H. Christ, I

coulda smoked another three packs!"

TERRI

Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.

JOEY

Yes I do.  Terri, something awful

happened to that boy.  I have to find

out what it was.

TERRI

But I don't know anything!  Really.  I

just came out of the club and the kid

was already in the street.  He ...

JOEY

Did you know him?

TERRI

No.  I'd seen him in there a few times

before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never

like danced with him or anything.

Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've

taken it from the statue.

JOEY

Taken what?

TERRI

The thing!  He was lying there in the

street, moaning.  But he pointed at it

...

22

JOEY

Wait a minute.  He was already ...

wounded ... when you found him?

TERRI

Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it

was lying next to him.  And he pointed

at it before he passed out and ...

JOEY

Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the

chains come from?

TERRI

That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...

TERRI

He said they came out of this.

23

WORKER

All done, Mr. Monroe.

WORKER

(mouthing silently)

Ass hole.

JP

What the ... ?

- as, again, the noise comes.  Is it a squeak - or is it the

24

JP

Aaaaaahh!!

- as JP's hand whips out of the hole, shaking in shock and

- as it lands heavily in a shadowed corner of the club and

- as he looks down at his finger, face snarling.

JP

Son of a ...

JP

(off)

... bi ...

25

- as gradually the blueness subsides again, the visible blood

JOEY

(off)

Oh my God ...

JOEY

(off)

Did I sleep through an earthquake?

- showing the chaos all around the kitchen: Spilled flour on

26

TERRI

I figured I'd make breakfast.

JOEY

Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice

of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always

this ... exploratory?

TERRI

Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time.

Kitchen virgin, that's me.

JOEY

I'll boil some water.

TERRI

I'll do it!

JOEY

No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love

boiling water.  It's a specialty of

mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?

TERRI

This is great.  And it's yours?  You

like own it?

JOEY

The bank owns it.  But I'm working on

it.

TERRI

Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I

haven't even had a room of my own since

I was fifteen years old.

27

JOEY

How have you ... ?

TERRI

Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.

- as Terri walks on, pausing by the shelves of books.

TERRI

Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?

JOEY

No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of

course I've read them.

TERRI

Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like

all these people discovering who they

used to be.  You know, like

reincarnation?  It was really good.  You

ever read that?

JOEY

I don't think so.  But it's a

fascinating subject.  Did you ...

TERRI

Great view!  Great view!  Look at this!

JOEY

Actually, I'm pretty familiar with the

view ...

28

JOEY

(off)

... but it is good.  You know, over to

the left, you can ...

TERRI

(looking to right and pointing)

Who's that?

JOEY

I don't know his name ...  I saw the

whole story.  A wounded bird was on his

roof.  I could hear its cries from here.

He went straight to it.  I couldn't've.

I'd be frozen between pity and fear.

But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly

to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it.

Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday

he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the

pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn.

Learn that there was one more thing he

had to do to make the rescue complete.

And one day, just as afternoon became

evening, he leaned over, opened the

cage, and walked away.  Didn't look

back.  But he heard the sound of its

wings.

TERRI

And he still sits there?

JOEY

Every day.

TERRI

Maybe he thinks it'll come back.

JOEY

No.  He knows it won't.  It was his

final act of love and part of him knows

that and part of him doesn't yet.

29

TERRI

Bullshit!  He should've kept it.  It'd

live longer!  It's dangerous out there!

People get hurt!

- as she realizes she has a wounded pigeon of her own.

JOEY

What?  I wasn't talking about ... I ...

Do you want to stay?  You want to stay

here for a while?

JOEY

OK.  OK.  It's a done deal.  But look

you have to help me.  I've got to solve

this thing.  I've got to know what's

going on.

TERRI

But I don't know what's going on.

JOEY

Maybe not.  But you know more than I do.

You know something about this box.

Something about a statue?

TERRI

Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it

and I figured ...

JOEY

Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?

TERRI

No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like

owns the club.  You know?  You were

there?  He bought the statue.

JOEY

That you found.  What do you mean you

found it?

30

TERRI

I was downtown looking for a ... a

friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there

was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa

weird shit in there.  I saw this statue.

Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it.

You've seen the club.

JOEY

Would you know this store again?

TERRI

Sure.  Why?

JOEY

It's Saturday morning.  Let's go

shopping.

JOEY

Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?

TERRI

Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?

JOEY

What on earth were you doing down here?

JOEY

Terri?

TERRI

Buying some drugs, alright?

JOEY

Oh, Terri ...

31

TERRI

For somebody else, alright?  Not for me.

I don't do that shit anymore.

JOEY

Then you shouldn't even be around it.

You know, it's ...

TERRI

Here!  Here!  Pull over!

TERRI

Yeah.  See.  I told you it was here.

- as she looks at Terri from behind, her face worried for her

- as they walk through the store.

MAMA

(off)

Can I help?

32

JOEY

Yes.  Thank you.  We were wondering ...

Terri, show her the box.

MAMA

No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my

customers.  Have you tried ...

JOEY

No.  No, you don't understand.  We're

not selling it.  It came from here.  We

want ...

MAMA

Everything sold as is.  No guarantees.

No returns.

JOEY

No.  We want ...

MAMA

I took back everything bought on a whim,

I'd have no business.  I ...

TERRI

Lady, will you shut the fuck up and give

her a break.

MAMA

Quite a mouth.  So what's the problem?

You tell me.  You I like.

JOEY

Thank you.  This came off a ... statue?

A pillar.  We wondered if you knew

anything about the piece.  About where

it came from.

MAMA

Oh ... yeah.  Yeah.  That thing.  Ugly.

Real ugly.  I sold that?

33

MAMA

Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made

the store feel strange.  Who'd make such

a thing?

JOEY

Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us

anything about it?

MAMA

It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony-

bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.

JOEY

What else came with it?  Anything still

here?

MAMA

Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff

nobody'd ever want.

JOEY

Can we see?

MAMA

You gonna buy?

JOEY

I don't know.  Maybe.

MAMA

Right at the back there.  Middle

shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff.

I'd do you a good price.

JOEY

Terri, check out the other folder.

34

TERRI

What am I looking for?

JOEY

God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.

TERRI

Jesus.  You're gonna pay her for this

shit?  It's like fucking business papers

for God's sake!

- as she flicks through the contents.

- which sits on the floor in the shaft of sunlight, the dust

35

- as her eyes flick back and forth as she scans ...

- as she realizes what she is looking at.

JOEY

(softly)

Alright ...

TERRI

Joey ... ?

JOEY

(still staring at Box)

Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think

the lady just made a sale.

36

JOEY

Yeah ... yeah ... yeah ... No, it's

important that I speak to ... What?  No,

don't ...          (a beat)       Put.

Me.  On.  Hold.  You.  Stupid.  Bitch.

JOEY

Hi.  Now listen.  And listen good.  I'm

the Station Manager at W-QQY.  For the

last half-hour you've been dicking

around with my assistant.  Let me tell

you something.  With or without your co-

operation we are making this expose.  I

assume you're smart enough to guess

which version is going to make you look

good.  Now, if you can't put one hand on

that cassette and the other on a FedEx

man's butt within thirty seconds then

you damn well better put me through to

somebody who can.

JOEY

Dr.  Fallon?  How nice of you to take my

call.  I understand you're in charge of

video archive from the Channard

Institute ... ?

37

JP

Welcome.

38

SANDY

You're JP Monroe, right?

JP

Uh-huh.

SANDY

And this is your club.  Great club.  I

really love it here.  Great club.

JP

Thank you.

SANDY

Thank you for the drink.  And the rose.

Wow.  That's ... really nice.

JP

It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.

SANDY

A prize?  For what?

JP

You see, everyday I have my friend John

here bring ...

SANDY

The barman?  I thought he was called

Rick?

JP

He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind

if I continue?

SANDY

I'm sorry.

JP

Everyday I have my friend Rick here

bring a newly-cut red rose in with him

and keep it behind the bar.  And I award

it to a woman of exceptional beauty.

SANDY

Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here

who look better than ...

JP

Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down.

If you have a quality, be proud of it...

39

JP

... Let it define you.  Whatever it is.

Most of the roses die behind the bar.

This is the first I've given out for

nearly a month.

SANDY

No.  Really?

JP

Yes really.

SANDY

Wow.  Thank you.

JP

No.  Thank you.

- except they're not there.  The two bar-stools are empty.

- now the right way up, it stands in a corner of the room.  As

40

- FAVORING the telephone/answering machine, its red message

- as Joey waits for her machine and glances around the room

JOEY

Terri?

FALLON

(on ansafone)

Ms.  Summerskill.  Joanne.  Hello.  This

is Dr. Fallon.  Martin.  Your reference

material is on its way to you.  I very

much enjoyed talking to you and I hope

that if I'm ever in town you'll do me

the honor of (sqwaaaaalk)

JOEY

In your dreams, pal.

WOMAN

(on ansafone)

... your number from your resume.

Which was very impressive, by the way.

My name is Sharon Leech and you can

reach me here at K-YZY in Monterey, area

code 805 ... (sqwaaalk)

JOEY

(to herself)

Shit. Why now? Why not last week? Oh ...

42

JOEY

(whispered)

Goodnight, Terri ...

SANDY

So cool ...

SANDY

Radical.

SANDY

Wow.  You've got great taste.  This ...

well ... this really says it, you know?

It's really ... dark.

SANDY

Don't you think?

43

JP

Mmn-hmnn.

SANDY

Do you mind me talking about your stuff?

JP

Unh-unh.

SANDY

If it bothers you, just say so.

JP

It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not

interested.

SANDY

Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.

SANDY

But you gave me a rose ...

JP

And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody

else.  Get dressed.  Get out.

SANDY

You shit.  Who do you think you are?

JP

I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch.

Now get the fuck out of my life.

SANDY

You ... I can't fucking believe you, you

bastard!  You get me in here ...

JP

Right.  Like you were hog-tied or

something.

44

SANDY

Look at you!  You think you're some God

damn Prince or something.  With your

shitty little Kingdom out there and all

this ugly shi ....

JP

Jesus Christ!

PINHEAD

Not quite.

45

- who has sunk to the floor, staring at the pillar.

JP

What ... What ... ?

PINHEAD

What did you see?  The same as I.

Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You

saw the working of the world in

miniature.

JP

That had nothing to do with the world.

Not this one, anyway.

PINHEAD

On the contrary.  It has everything to

do with the world.  And our dreams of

how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed

the girl?

JP

Yes.

PINHEAD

Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...

JP

No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ...

No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.

46

PINHEAD

How uncomfortable that word must feel on

your lips.  Evil.  Good.  There is no

Good, Monroe.  There is no Evil.  There

is only the flesh and the patterns to

which we can submit it.  You will help

me to ...

JP

No.  No no no.  No fuckin' way.  I'm

gone ...

PINHEAD

(off)

Another offering?

47

PINHEAD

I'm touched ... That is the gun you used

to kill your parents?

PINHEAD

I understand.  Their fortune was so

tempting, their affection so

conditional.  What else could you do?

JP

Fuck you!

PINHEAD

Thank you.  Now, shall we talk sensibly?

PINHEAD

Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a

quality, let it define you.  Cultivate

it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will

help yourse...

JP

What!?  What are you talking about?  Why

should I help you?

PINHEAD

Because you want to.  You've always

wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look

at your sculptures.  Look at those

tawdry representations and then ...

Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as

canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will

and mine as the brush and the knife.

Oh, I have such sights to show you.

JP

What are you?

48

PINHEAD

A dark star rising.  I was bound to

another's system by a soul I once

possessed.  A friend relieved me of that

inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born

again of Blood and Desire.

JP

Hey, that's what makes the world go

round.

PINHEAD

You see, we're not so dissimilar.

JP

But how in God's name ...

PINHEAD

God?  My God was diamond and black

light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All

that is changed.  A terrible beauty is

born.  With a place at my right hand for

a man of your tastes.

JP

How do we start?

PINHEAD

It has already begun.

JOEY

(softly)

Alright ... Let's see what we got here.

49

KIRSTY

(on video)

I don't know what the Box is.  But I

know what it does.  I ...    (looks up

to side)     I've said all this before.

Do you ...    (blinks, nods, as if

listening.  Looks back to camera)  I saw

it open.  I opened it.  I saw what came

out.  I don't know what else to call

them.  Demons.  Demons live in the box.

Or come through the box from somewhere

else.  It's a gateway to Hell.  Or the

South Bronx.     (smiles ruefully at her

own joke.  Looks up to side as if

me.  I know what it sounds like.  But

what else ... Jesus, talk to Ronson,

talk to the other cops.  They saw the

house.  They saw my ... my father ...

Solving the puzzle means opening the

box.  Opening the box means opening

doors.  And there are some doors you

don't want to open.  And it may be

metaphorical to you, Doctor, but you

haven't had some blue-faced bastard come

at you with hooks and chains.  It isn't

delusion, it isn't psychosis.  It's

reality.  It's reality.     (Pause.

Long drag on the cigarette?)   Maybe not

this reality ... but there are others.

I've seen them.

51

TERRI

Jeez, Joey musta polished you up some.

Sometimes I think she's wierder than me.

TERRI

Joey?

JP

(on phone)

Not quite.

TERRI

JP?

JP

Live and in the flesh.  How're you

doing, babe?

TERRI

What do you want?

JP

God, always questions.  What do I want?

I don't want anything.  Just concerned

about you.  Just checking in.

52

TERRI

Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?

JP

Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend

left a card, remember?

TERRI

Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine.

Things are great here.  Joey's going to

get me a job at the TV station.  I'm

meeting lotsa new people.  It's really

great.

JP

Really?

TERRI

Yeah really.  I'm ...

JP

No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm

concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care

about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm

sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...

TERRI

You're apologizing?

JP

Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri,

I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets.

I'd like to put things right.  Don't

tell me you haven't thought about me.

Huh?

TERRI

Well ... of course I have.  I've

thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so

horrible.  You really hurt me ...

JP

I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad

person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I

really do.  And I really miss you.

TERRI

I miss you too.

JP

That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It

really is. You know, I .. are you alone?

TERRI

Yes.

53

JP

Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you

come over?  You know, nothing heavy,

little drink maybe, little talk.  Just

see how we both feel?

TERRI

Oh, I don't ...

JP

C'mon.  It'll be great.

TERRI

No!  No.  I can't.  I just can't.

TERRI

Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit.

JOEY

(ansafone message)

Hi.  You've reached Joanne Summerskill.

In spirit at least.  Please leave a

message.  Thanks.

WOMAN

(on phone)

Hello.  Ms. Summerskill, this is Sharon

Leech again from K-YZY in Monterey.

Sorry to call so late but I was

wondering if you got my other message?

Look, I probably shouldn't say this on

tape but what the hell ... there's a job

here if you want it.  Late-night news

reader.  We think you'd be marvelous ..

KIRSTY

(Looks to side)  Again?  (Shrugs. Looks

back at camera)  The box.  I don't know

where it came from.  I don't know who

made it or why.  I only know what it

does.  It hurts.  It hurts.   (Looks off

to side as if listening.)  How?  (Looks

back)  I don't know.  It kind of opens

itself.  Your fingers move.  You learn.

It wants to open, that's the thing.  And

it knows when you want to open it.  And

it helps.  And it opens.  And then they

come.  The Cenobites.  The demons.

- as, on the one monitor, a new image suddenly appears:

55

ELLIOTT

(on monitor)

She's telling the truth, Joey.

KIRSTY

Look, you can have me tell this ...

KIRSTY

...  as often as you want.  There's not

going to be any breakthrough.  You might

think it's delusion, but it's not.  I

saw them.  I looked into their eyes and

they looked back at me.  Creatures from

Hell.

- sitting at the table staring at the coffee.

56

- as JP walks confidently to her table, smiling.

JP

Hey, babe.  Thanks for coming.

JOEY

Terri, we can't bunk up every night!

People will ...

JOEY

(off)

... talk.  ... Terri?

57

JOEY

Oh shit.

SOLDIER 1

(off)

He's going.  He's going.  He's going ...

SOLDIER 2

(off)

We're losing him.  We're losing him.

We're losing him ...

58

JOEY

(off)

Noooooooooo .......

JOEY

Nooooooooooo!

JOEY

Is somebody here?  Is somebody here!?

Terri ... ?

59

JOEY

What ... What's going on?  What's

happening?

ELLIOTT

You have to help me, Joey.

JP

Come on in.

60

JP

Not a good neighborhood.  People

disappear.  (a beat)  Feel like home?

It's just like you left it.

TERRI

Not quite.  This wasn't here.

JP

No.  But, as you can see, I'm having

some work done on it.  You found a real

treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can

show you how grateful I am.

TERRI

Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.

JP

Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it

up.  Put her heart and soul into it.

TERRI

A girl?  Anyone I should know?

JP

Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're

here, it's like she doesn't even exist,

you know what I mean?

TERRI

Yeah right.  Look ...

JP

Terri, listen.    (a beat)   Why don't

you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's

probably ticking away in both our minds,

right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it

going to happen?  Let's get it out of

the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can

relax.  Talk.  You know.

61

TERRI

I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not

ready yet.

JP

Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool.

I mean, we've got all night.

JP

That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was

obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready

to dump you the second she had what she

needed, interfering little whore.

TERRI

No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's

like I must have done something wrong,

you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked

up something good again.

JP

Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You

know that.  It was my fault, babe, it

really was.  And you know I'm sorry.

And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I

hate to see you in pain like this.

62

TERRI

Really?

JP

Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to

hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's

alright.

JP

No.  No, sweetheart, you come to me.

It's not fair.  I come over there.  You

know.  We're on the bed.  I just ...

'cos you know how much you excite me.

God, just looking at you.  You're so

beautiful.  I come over there and I'd

just want to touch you.  Feel you.  Kiss

you.  And that isn't what this is about.

C'mon, babe, come to daddy.  Let me make

it better.

- as he blows it.  A sidelong glance at the pillar?  A sudden

TERRI

No ... Wait a ...

63

PINHEAD

Bring her to me, boy!

PINHEAD

Wait!  Why run?  Where to?  Do you know

where you are?

TERRI

I'm ... I'm ...

PINHEAD

You're at the door of dreams.  And you

can open it.

TERRI

What are you talking about?

64

PINHEAD

There are two keys in this room.  On is

in the pocket of this fool.  You could

take it out without me reaching you. (a

beat)  Probably.  And you could use it

to let yourself back in to the world you

know.  The world you've always known;

banal, hopeless, dreamless.

TERRI

And ... like ... the other?

PINHEAD

The other is the key to dreams.  To a

world of black miracles and dark wonder.

Another life of unknown pleasures.  It's

yours.  Complete the pattern.  Solve the

puzzle.  Turn the key.

- as she looks at the monster.  And smiles.

TERRI

Where is it?

PINHEAD

It's lying bleeding at your feet.

JP

(delerious. Ad-lib)

Unhhh ... Terri ... what ... no ...

- as the bond between tempter and tempted is strengthened.

65

JP

(screaming)

No! Terri! Please! I didn't mean to..!!

PINHEAD

I have such sights to show you.

- as the transformation of pillar into Pinhead is completed.

66

- as she gets out of bed.

- as Joey tries to locate the source of the music and the

67

JOEY

How .... ?

68

ENGLISH VOICE

... and the King has sent a

personal message of sympathy to the

parents of those brave men who ...

FRENCH VOICE

L'Oiseau chante avec ses doigts.  Deux

fois.

ELLIOTT

Joey.  Look out your window.

69

- as she stares beyond her window into this impossible scene.

JOEY

Tell me ... Tell me ... Hello?

JOEY

I'm seven floors up ... I'm seven floors

up! I can't ...

JOEY

Now what?  I'm here.  Now what?  I just

walked into madness for you.  Talk!

70

JOEY

Great.  That's just great!  You bring me

here.  You freeze up on me.  And now

there's no way out.  I've had dates like

you before.  I ...

JOEY

Thanks.  I think.

JOEY

What's going on?  Is this a dream?

- as she turns from looking into the hut and gasps, her eyes

ELLIOTT

Joey.  How kind of you to come.

71

JOEY

Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help

me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming

this?

ELLIOTT

You have to help me.  You will

understand.  And no, you're not

dreaming.  Do you know where we are?

JOEY

It's ... I don't know.  First World War,

right?

ELLIOTT

Correct.  The fields of France.  And

many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me.

My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser.

Captain.

JOEY

Joey Summerskill.

ELLIOTT

Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably

never shaken hands with a ghost before,

am I right?

JOEY

Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What

the Hell is going on?

ELLIOTT

Hell is precisely what is going on,

Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I

because of a special obligation, you

because you're the only person who can

help. And because you know what is

right, and just, and true.  Will you

walk with me a while?

72

ELLIOTT

There were days in this war, days right

on top of each other, when the newly

dead were numbered in the tens of

thousands.  They called it the war to

end all wars.  Though it didn't.  You

know that.  There were more wars.  More

dead.  Your father's war.  Your dream

search for your father led you here.  To

me.  Joey, we need to talk.

ELLIOTT

The war pulled poetry out of some of us.

Others it affected differently.  This is

me a few years later.  We're in India,

by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like

many survivors. Lost souls with nothing

left to believe in but gratification.

We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many

dead.  For us God, too, fell at

Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And

if we mourned, we mourned in silence.

Thousands drank themselves to death.

Others went further.  I went further.  I

thought I was a lost soul.  But, until

this frozen moment, I didn't even know

what the phrase meant.

JOEY

And what is ... this frozen moment?

ELLIOTT

The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I

am, what I will be ... past, present,

future, all bound here at this timeless

moment of decision.  I was an explorer

of forbidden vices and pleasures.

Opening the Box was my final act of

exploration, of discovery.

JOEY

And what did you discover?

73

ELLIOTT

Something bad.

JOEY

And why are you back?  Why are we here?

ELLIOTT

Because something worse is coming.

(a beat)

I opened the Box, Joey.  I found the

monster within it.  And it found the

monster within me.  For decades I served

Hell with no memory of my former life

until a friend released me.  You saw

her.

JOEY

Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your

soul was freed, why are you back?

ELLIOTT

Because - monster as I was - I was bound

by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box

had to be opened to let me out.  The

truly innocent were safe.  That's no

longer true.  The shell of the beast has

been fleshed.  What I was is out there,

Joey.  In your world.  Unbound.

Unstoppable.

JOEY

What will he do?  What does he want?

ELLIOTT

He'll do what he does best.  But he'll

do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the

Earth forever, indulging his taste for

all the myriad subtleties of human

suffering.

JOEY

What can we do?

74

ELLIOTT

I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right

questions.  There is something we can do

but it will require great courage.

JOEY

I don't know ...

ELLIOTT

Joey, you walked through your window

from one reality to another.  You're

stronger than you think.

JOEY

Then tell me what to do.

ELLIOTT

This is his first night on Earth.  He

wants to close the door behind him.

Like all Lieutenants, he covets command.

There's a gateway to Hell through which

he can be taken back.  He has to destroy

it.

JOEY

So where is it?

ELLIOTT

Your apartment.

JOEY

Wha .... ?

ELLIOTT

The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.

75

CROWD

(ad-lib)

Oh My God ...

Jesus Christ!

What the FUCK ... ?!

No no no no no no no ....

76

- as the ringing of a phone grows in volume.

JOEY

Hello?

DOC

(on phone)

You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn

on the TV now.  And then get your ass

down here ... (click) ...

JOEY

Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?

77

DOC

(off)

Judas Priest!  Will you look at ...

BURLY COP

Move it!  Now!  No pictures!

DOC

(off)

W-QQY.  I ...

BURLY COP

I don't give a shit!  Move it or lose

it!

JOEY

Oh my God, it's happening ...

DOC

I thought ... what's ... I think there's

something up there ...

78

JOEY

No!  No, Doc, don't ... don't ...

DOC

Shit!  What was ...

ANCHORPERSON

Well, we've ... er ... yes, we've

temporarily lost our pictures there and

... and ...

JOEY

Doc!  DOC!!

JOEY

C'mon.  C'mon!

79

EDDIE

I'll get it!  I promise!  I'll ...

ELDER COP

Don't promise me shit, you little fuck!

You know what your promise is worth to

me?  Huh?  Fifty per cent of fuck-all!

YOUNGER COP

Give him the money, Eddie.

EDDIE

I don't ...

YOUNGER COP

Give him the money, Eddie.

EDDIE

Just listen to me, Please!  I ...

ELDER COP

I'm done listening, shit-brain!  Where

you been all day?  They shut the school?

Kindergarten closed?  No customers?

Huh?  Huh?

YOUNGER COP

Give him the money, Eddie.  Tell ya, I'm

gonna puke if he beats on you any more.

Just give him the ...

80

YOUNGER COP

... money.  What the ... ?

ELDER COP

(Calm. Expecting obedience)

You, fuckoff.

ELDER COP

Get your head outta your stinkin' ass

and look at me, boy.

YOUNGER COP

(still looking down alley)

Hey ...

ELDER COP

(to Eddie)

Get lost.

ELDER COP

I have the distinct impression I told

you to fuckoff.  Unless I miss my guess,

you've just disobeyed an officer of the

law.

PINHEAD

I am the Law.

ELDER COP

You're one butt-ugly son of a bitch and

you're about to dead meat.

81

PINHEAD

I am the son of eternal night and you

are about to discover pain has no

ending.

YOUNGER COP

Oh shh ...

ELDER COP

No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.

PINHEAD

Curb your tongue.

82

JOEY

But I have to see him!  I'm his friend!

PARAMEDIC

Lady, trust me!  You really don't want

to go ...

JOEY

No!  NO!!

83

PRIEST

(calling down aisle)

Is there anyone there?  Hello?

84

PRIEST

How dare you!

PINHEAD

I am the Way.

PRIEST

You'll burn in Hell for this!

PINHEAD

Burn?  What a limited imagination.

PINHEAD

This is my body.  This is my blood.

Happy are they who come to my supper.

85

JOEY

(appalled)

Oh God ...

JOEY

Having fun en route, you bastard.

86

JOEY

Oh shit ...

87

JOEY

No!

PINHEAD

Watch.

PINHEAD

The Box can't be destroyed.  Like pain

or the poor, it is always with us.  But

as long as I have it, no-one can open

it.  Now come here and die.  You have

friends in Hell waiting to greet you.

JOEY

You'll have to come and get me, you ugly

bastard.

PINHEAD

Spirited.  Good.  I'll enjoy making you

bleed.  I'll enjoy making you enjoy it.

88

- shows his arm entering the shattered window and also shows

PINHEAD

(furious rage)

Aahhhh!!!

ELLIOTT

Joey!  Back to the wall, quickly!

JOEY

Elliott!  No!  What about you?!  Where

will you be?!

89

ELLIOTT

Back with the damned.  No more hope of

heaven.  But I drag this monster back

with me!

PINHEAD

You stupid interfering foo ... AAAAAH!

JOEY

Elliott? ... Elliott? ... You can't

hear me, can you?  It's 1921.  I'm not

really here ...

90

JOEY

(SCREAMS!!!!)

PINHEAD

Oh, no kiss of welcome after 70 years?

PINHEAD

This will be so good, Joey.  You loved

him, didn't you?  I can feel him inside,

weeping for you.  He can watch through

the centuries as we discover the things

that make you whimper.

91

PINHEAD

You never met, did you?  This was JP

Monroe.

JP CENOBITE

Have you seen what they did to me?  Have

you seen what they did?  You interfering

little whore!

JOEY

Terri?  Oh no!  NO!!  TERRI!!

TERRI CENOBITE

Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You

think you're going to live forever?

JOEY

Wanna light, you bitch?!

92

PINHEAD

Wait!

PINHEAD

You can send me back.  But why?  I can

help you, Joey.  I can give you what you

want.

JOEY

You'll never know what I want ...

PINHEAD

Respect.  Power.  You and I can put your

name on the World's lips, your face on

it's screens ...
