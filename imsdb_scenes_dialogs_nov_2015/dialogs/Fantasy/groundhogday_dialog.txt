HAWLEY

Christ, what a pit. Phil"

PHIL

(SLEEPY)

What?

HAWLEY

It's February first, Phil. You

know what tomorrow is?

PHIL

(catching on)

Oh, no! Not again.

PHIL

Forget it! I'm not going.

-3-

PHIL

Get away from me. I'm working.

HAWLEY

So what's the outlook? We gonna

get that blizzard?

PHIL

No way. All that moisture coming

up from the Gulf is going to miss

us completely and take a dump on

Harrisburg.

HAWLEY

(with authority)

Good, 'cause you're going up to

Punxsutawney to cover the

groundhog story tomorrow morning

and I want you back here in time

to do the five.

PHIL

Jesus, Gil, give me a break, will

you! I covered the goddamn

groundhog last year and the year

before that.

HAWLEY

And you'll do it :next year and

the year after, too. When I

worked in San Diego, I covered

the swallows coming back to

Capistrano for ten years in a

row.

PHIL

You should've killed the guy who

made you do that.

HAWLEY

I wanted to do it.

PHIL

Then you should've killed

yourself. I don't want to get

stuck with the groundhog for the

rest of my life.

-4-

HAWLEY

It's a cute story. He comes out,

he looks around, he wrinkles up

his little nose, he sniffs around

a little, he sees his shadow, he

d oesn't see his shadow-- it's

nice. People like it.

PHIL

Many people are morons.

HAWLEY

Just do it.

PHIL

What'11 you give me?

HAWLEY

(to Phil)

I'll give you Rita.

(calls her over)

Rita, could you come here for a

second? I got a little job for

you.

PHIL

(TEASING)

You can't send Rita out on a

story like this. She's just a

cub, a pup, still wet behind the

ears. Look at her. Her ears are

sopping wet. This needs a

Woodward or a Bernstein. It's a

big story. People need to know.

RITA

(INTRIGUED)

What's the story?

HAWLEY

The Punxsutawney Groundhog

Festival.

RITA

Gil, if it's all right with you

I ' d rather follow-up on the

nurses' strike.

-5-

HAWLEY

You can do the nurses when you

get back. Just take the squeaky

wheel here up to Punxsutawney and

get him back in one piece. Okay?

RITA

Yeah, okay.

PHIL

(PLEASANTLY)

You know, this could be extremely

interesting.

RITA

I've never done a weather story

before. What's Punxsutawney

like?

PHIL

Oh, it's an enchanted place. A

magical world. It's the

Constantinople of the whole

Western Appalachian-Susquehanna

Drainage system.

RITA

Do you always joke?

PHIL

About 70 to 80% of the time.

Inside I'm actually a very shy

and sensitive person.

RITA

A lot of people around here think

you're not very sincere.

PHIL

Tell me the names of these

people.

RITA

I'll line up a crew and

transportation. If you don't

feel like driving, we can all go

up in the van together.

PHIL

I think I'll take my own car.

I ' m not that fond of my fellow

man.

-6-

RITA

(EXITING)

Nice attitude.

PHIL

Nice face.

(calls after her)

Why don't you ride up with me?

RITA

No, thanks.

PHIL

(on the phone)

They don't really think of me as

a weatherman around here. More

of a "personality," but with the

credibility of a first-class

broadcast journalist. Once you

look at my tape I think you'll

see what they mean.

STEPHANIE

(BITTERLY)

I just want to know one thing:

did I do something wrong or are

you just tired of me or what? I

have to know.

PHIL

(on the phone)

Dan, can I call you back? I've

just been handed something and I

better get on it...

(he picks up some

papers and rustles

them for effect)

...Okay, thanks.

-7-

PHIL

(KINDLY)

You didn't do anything wrong,

Stephanie, and I ' m not tired of

you. It's just that I don't have

time for a real relationship

right now. I told you that the

first time we went out.

STEPHANIE

(getting close)

Everybody says that at the

beginning of a relationship.

PHIL

(gently pushing her

AWAY)

I'm different. I really meant

it! Things are really starting

to move for me now. I ' m not

going to be doing the weather for

the rest of my life. I was just

talking to the CBS guy about a

network job. I want that. This

is just the beginning for me. I

can't waste any more time.

STEPHANIE

Are you saying our relationship

was a waste of time?

PHIL

Our relationship? We went out a

total of four times! And only

twice did anything happen. It

was fun but I don't see that as

a big commitment.

STEPHANIE

(closing in again)

I had our charts done. My

astrologer says we're extremely

compatible. There may even be

some past lives involvement here.

PHIL

See? So we've already done this.

Let's move on. Next case.

STEPHANIE

You know what's wrong with you,

Phil? You're selfish. You don't

have time for anyone but

yourself.

-8-

PHIL

That's what I ' m trying to tell

you. You don't want to be with

me. You can do better. Look,

Stephanie, if I ever said or did

anything to mislead you I'm sorry

for that, but right now I have to

do this groundhog thing and I

don't have a handle on it yet.

PHIL (CONT.)

I'll tell you what. I ' m going to

do some serious thinking while

I ' m in Punxsutawney, okay?

CUT TO:

PHIL (V.O.)

(on his earphone)

I'm on my way to Punxsutawney...

(forced to repeat it,

a little embarrassed)

Punx^su-taw-ney....Work or fun?

I think that all depends on you.

PHIL

. . . . I thought maybe you could

meet me up there tonight and let

me vulgarize you for about seven

hours....So I ' m supposed to spend

the night in Punxsutawney all

alo ne? Thanks.

CUT TO:

PHIL

(calls out)

Rita! I can't stay here.

LARRY

(MUTTERING)

Prima donnas.

RITA

It's okay. I'll handle it.

RITA

What's the problem, Phil?

PHIL

I hate this place. I stayed here

two years ago and I was

miserable. It's like a minimum

security prison. I'm not staying

here.

-10-

RITA

You're not staying here.

PHIL

(BRIGHTENING)

I ' m not?

RITA

No, Larry and I don't care but I

thought you might, so I booked

you at a very nice bed and

breakfast on Cherry Street.

Here's the address.

PHIL

(PLEASED)

Great. That's great. That's the

mark of a really good producer.

Making the talent happy.

RITA

Whatever I can do.

PHIL

Really? Will you be my love

slave?

RITA

Whatever I can do within reason.

Would you like to have dinner

with Larry and me?

PHIL

No thanks, I've seen Larry eat.

Why don't you ditch Larry and let

me take you someplace nice?

RITA

You mean like a date?

PHIL

Yeah.

RITA

Oh, no.

PHIL

Okay. I get it. You're a little

intimidated by me, you're all

excited about the shoot tomorrow,

you want everything to go just

perfect. I understand. You just

get some sleep. Tomorrow will be

great.

-11-

RITA

Well, that's something to look

forward to. I'll see you in the

morning.

LARRY

Did he actually call himself "the

talent?"

CUT TO:

DEEJAY

Okay, campers, rise and shine,

and don't forget your booties

because it's COOOLD out there

TODAY1

SIDEK ICK

It's cold out there everyday.

W hat is this-- Miami Beach?

-12-

DEEJAY

Not hardly. And you can expect

hazardous travel later today with

that, you know, blizzard thing--

SIDEKICK

That "blizzard thing?"

SIDEKICK (CONT.)

Oh, here's the report: the

National Weather Service is

calling for a big blizzard thing.

DEEJAY

Yes they are, but there's another

reason today is very special--

SIDEKICK

Es pec ia lly cold--

DEEJAY

Especially cold, okay, but the

big question on everybody's lips--

SIDEKICK

Ch ap pe d lips--

DEEJAY

:--on their chapped lips, right--

Do you think Phil's going to come

out and see his shadow?

SIDEKICK

Punxsutawney Phil.

DEEJAY

That's right, rodent lovers!

IT'S--

BOTH DEEJAYS

Groundhog Day1

PHIL

(to himself)

Never again.

CUT TO:

-13-

CHUBBY MAN

Morning .

PHIL

Morning .

CHUBBY MAN

Think it'll be an early Spring?

PHIL

I ' m predicting March 21st.

CUT TO:

MRS. LANCASTER

Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

PHIL

(with mock civility)

Like a Roumanian orphan, Mrs.

Lancaster.

MRS. LANCASTER

Would you like some coffee?

PHIL

I don't suppose it1 d be possible

to get an espresso or a capuccino

around here.

MRS. LANCASTER

(BLANKLY)

I don't really know --

PHIL

Forget it. This '11 be fine.

-14-

MRS. LANCASTER

( as she pours)

I wonder what the weather's going

to be like for all the

festivities.

PHIL

My guess is it'11 be cold and

overcast, high today in the low

30's, dropping to the low 20's

tonight, but I'm predicting that

all that moisture coming up from

the Gulf is going to miss us and

dump some locally heavy snow,

possibly blizzard conditions with

travel advisories in the

Harrisburg area and maybe as far

east as .Philadelphia.

(off her surprised

LOOK)

You want to talk weather, you

asked the right guy.

;MRS. LANCASTER

:

Oh, will you be checking out

today, Mr. Connors?

PHIL

Unfortunately yes.

CUT TO:

MAN (O.C.)

Hey, Phil!

-15-

NED

Phil! Phil Connors! I thought

that was you!

PHIL

(at a loss)

I 'm sorry. Have we-- uh--

NED

My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't

say you don't remember me, 'cause

I sure as heckrfire remember you.

Well?

NED

Ned Ryerson? Needlenose Ned?

Ned the Head. Come on, buddy.

Case Western High?

PHIL

Ned?

NED

I see you clicking through that

brain of yours. Click-click,

c li ck- cli ck, click-click--Bing!

Ned Ryerson, did the whistling

trick with my belly button in the

talent show. Bing! Ned Ryerson,

got the shingles real bad senior

^year^ almost didn't graduate.

Bing again! Ned Ryerson, went

out with your sister Mary Pat a

couple of times-- 'til you told

me not to anymore. Well?

PHIL

(RESIGNED)

Ned Ryerson.

NED

Bing!

PHIL

So what're you doing with

yourself, Ned?

NED

Phil, I sell insurance.

-16-

PHIL

(sorry he asked)

No kidding.

NED

Do you have life insurance, Phil?

'Cause if you do, I bet you could

u s e more-- who couldn't?--but I

got a feeling you don't have any.

Am I right?

PHIL

You know, Ned, I ' d love to talk

to you but I really have to--

NED

That's okay. I'll walk with you.

When I see an opportunity, I

charge it, like a bull. Ned the

Bull, that's me now. Some of my

friends live and die by actuarial

tables, but I think it's all just

a crap shoot anyhoo. Ever heard

of single .premium life? That

could be the ticket for you,

buddy. God, it's good to see

you! Hey, what're you doing for

dinner?

PHIL

Dinner? Umm, I don't think

that's going to work for me.

NED

Hey, look out for that first

step! It's a doozy!

CUT TO:

-17-

RITA

How could he be late?

LARRY

Prima donnas.

RITA

It's just so-- inconsiderate.

LARRY

What happens to some people?

They're born nice. They grow up

nice. You put 'em on TV and -

bam! Prima donnas.

RITA

Here he comes. Phil! Hey, Phil.

Over here!

RITA

Where've you been?

PHIL

I got hung up with some jerk I

went to high school with. So,

did you sleep okay without me?

You tossed and turned, didn't

you?

RITA

You're incredible.

PHIL

Who told you?

RITA

Ready when you are.

RITA

Looks like they're starting.

Roll tape.

-18-

LARRY

Rolling.

PHIL

(to camera)

Once a year, the eyes of the

nation turn here, to this tiny

hamlet in Pennsylvania, to watch

a master at work. The master?

Punxsutawney Phil, the world's

most famous weatherman, the

groundhog, who, as legend has it,

can predict the coming of an

early spring.

PHIL

And here's the big moment we've

all been waiting for. Let's just

see what Mr. Groundhog has to

say.

PHIL

Hey! Over here, you little

weasel!

PHIL

Great shot, huh, folks? Well,

that was certainly worth the

trip. Now we'll be hearing from

Mr. Buster Greene, President of

the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club,

the so-called Seer of Seers who

will interpret for us.

-19-

B U ST E R

He came out, and he saw his

shadow. Sorry, ladies and

gentlemen, but it looks like it's

going to be a long winter.

PHIL

(sarcastic, to camera)

Well, that's it. Sorry you

couldn't be here in person to

share the electric moment. This

is one event where televison

really fails to capture the

excitement of thousands of people

gathered to watch a large

squirrel predict the weather, and

I for one am deeply grateful to

have been a part of it.

Reporting for Channel 9, this is

Phil Connors.

RITA

(to Phil)

You want to try one that's a

little sweeter?

PHIL

(to Rita)

That's as sweet as I get. I'm

outa here.

LARRY

(MUTTERS)

Prima donnas.

CUT TO:

RITA

That was really lousy.

PHIL

Is it my fault the little rat

went south on us?

-20-

RITA

A real professional would have

handled it. You acted like it

was a personal insult. Who do

you think you are -- Wolf Blitzer?

PHIL

God, you really take this stuff

seriously, don't you.

RITA

Yes, I do. As far as I ' m

concerned there are no little

stories, Phil. Only little

reporters with big egos who think

they're too good for the job they

have to do.

PHIL

(trying to look hurt)

You really don't know me very

well, do you. 'Cause if you did

you could never say something

like that about me. I care!

Call me a cockeyed optimist but

I happen to think there's more to

this job than just getting my

ugly mug on the boob tube every

night.

RITA

Is that so.

PHIL

Yes, that is so.

PHIL

So as far as us getting together,

would you say the glass is half

empty or half full?

LARRY

(to Rita)

You ready? We better get going

if we ' re going to stay ahead of

the weather.

PHIL

You don't have to rush off, you

know. That storm is 'going to

miss us completely.

-21-

RITA

Nice working with you, Phil. See

you around.

Rita walks away, leaving him sitting alone.

CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Phil's Lexus is driving down the highway. Light snow is just

starting to fall.

PHIL(V.O)

(on the earphone)

I'll call you after I see the

network guy. I should be back

there in a couple of

hours...What?...1 can't hear you--

you're breaking up...Hello?

Sabrina?

INT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS

Phil is getting annoyed as the phone connection deteriorates.

The snow is getting heavier. Phil switches on the windshield

wipers.

PHIL

Sabrina ? Can you hear me? Shit!

He slams the phone back into it's cradle, then looks up and

notices slow traffic up ahead. He honks his horn as the

traffic comes to a complete stop. He keeps honking but nothing

moves.

He rolls down the window and looks up ahead. The highway is a

parking lot.

PHIL

No. No!

EXT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS

Phil jumps out and begins to walk down the highway, past the

parked cars, shivering in his light sweater and silk sport

shirt. The snowfall is getting heavier and the wind is pickin

up. The snow comes down unnaturally hard and fast. He walks

on, slipping and sliding in his expensive loafers until he

j comes to a police roadblock up ahead, manned by TWO HIGHWAY

PHIL

What's going on, Officer?

-22-

PATROLMAN

Nothin's goin1 on. We're closin1

the road. Big accident up ahead.

Blizzard movin1 in.

PHIL

What blizzard? A couple of

flakes! An isolated phenomenon

of nature.

PATROLMAN

Are you nuts? We got a major

storm movin' in.

PHIL

No, no. All that moisture is

going to miss us and hit

Harrisburg.

PATROLMAN

Pal, you got that moisture on

your head.

PHIL

But I have to get to Pittsburgh

today!

PATROLMAN

Mister, the only place anybody's

goin' on this road is back to

Punxsutawney.

CUT TO:

PHIL

So all the long distance lines

a re down? What about the

sa tellite? Is it snowing in

space?...But I have to call

Pittsburgh...Isn't there some

special line you keep open for

emergencies or for

celebrities?...Well, I'm both

really. I'm a celebrity in an

emergency. Can you patch me

through on that line?

-23-

CUT TO:

PHIL

You never saw me on TV-- on the

news?

NANCY

I don't think so. What part of

the news do you do?

PHIL

I ' m the White House correspondent

for NBC news.

NANCY

Oh , I ' m so sure .

PHIL

Ask me anything?

NANCY

Okay, how big is the White House?

PHIL

Three bedrooms, two and a half

baths. Looks much bigger than it

, is.

PHIL

Good start. I ' m sure they'll be

very happy. So what do you say?

You want to play doggie obedience

school with me?

-24-

NANCY

Thanks. I'll pass.

PHIL

Sit! Stay!

CUT TO:

-25-

DISSOLVE TO:

DEEJAY

Okay, campers, rise and shine,

and don't forget your booties

because it's COOOLD out there

today!

SIDEKICK

It's cold out there everyday.

What is this-- Miami Beach?

PHIL

(to himself)

Nice going guys. That's

yesterday's tape.

-26-

DEEJAY

Not hardly. Expect hazardous

travel later today with that, you

know, blizzard thing --

SIDEKICK

That "blizzard thing?"

SIDEKICK (CONT.)

Oh, here's the report: the

National Weather Service is

calling for a big blizzard

thing."

DEEJAY

Yes they are, but there's another

reason today is very special --

SIDEKICK

Especially cold --

DEEJAY

Especially cold, okay, but the

big question on everybody's lips --

SIDEKICK AND PHIL

Chapped lips --

DEEJAY

-- on their chapped lips, right --

Do you think Phil's going to come

out and see his shadow?

SIDEKICK

Punxsutawney Phil.

DEEJAY

That's right, rodent lovers!

IT'S--

BOTH DEEJAYS

Groundhog Day!

PHIL

(AGHAST)

What the hell?

CUT TO:

CHUBBY MAN

Morning.

PHIL

Morning.

CHUBBY MAN

Think it'll be an early Spring?

PHIL

(stops, irritated)

Didn't we do this yesterday?

CHUBBY MAN

(INTIMIDATED)

I don't know what you mean.

PHIL

Don't mess with me, pork chop.

What day is this?

CHUBBY MAN

(TERRIFIED)

Febr uary second--Groundhog Day!

PHIL

Okay. Sorry. I'm having a bad

day.

CHUBBY MAN

(to himself)

I'll say.

-28-

MRS. LANCASTER

Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

PHIL

(completely confused)

D i d I? I don't know--

MRS. LANCASTER

Would you like some coffee?

PHIL

Yes, thank you. I ' m feeling a

little strange.

MRS. LANCASTER

( as she pours)

I wonder what the weather's going

to be like for all the

festivities.

PHIL

Did you ever have deja vu, Mrs.

Lancaster?

MRS. LANCASTER

Is that the Italian dessert with

the brandy and the chocolate

mousse?

PHIL

No, that's spaghetti. Never

mind.

MRS. LANCASTER

Oh, will you be checking out

today, Mr. Connors?

PHIL

(VAGUELY)

I don't know. I don't think so.

I'll tell you after I wake up.

CUT TO:

-29-

PHIL

Ma'am? Excuse me. Where's

everybody going?

PASSERBY

To Gobbler's Knob. It's

Groundhog Day!

NED RYERSON (O.C.)

Hey, Phil!

NED

Phil! Phil Connors! I thought

that was you!

NED

My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't

say you don't remember me, 'cause

I sure as heck-fire remember you.

Well?

PHIL

Ned Ryerson?

NED

Bing! First shot right out of

the box. So how's it going, ol'

buddy?

PHIL

To tell you the truth, Neddy, I ' m

not feeling real well. Could you

excuse me?

NED

Now it's funny you should mention

your health 'cause you'll never

guess what I do.

-30-

PHIL

(very distressed and

desperate to get away

from this guy)

Do you sell insurance, Ned?

NED

Bing again! You're sharp as a

tack today. Do you have life

insurance, Phil? 'Cause if you

do, I bet you could use more --

who couldn't?" -- but I got a

feeling you don't have any. Am

I right?

PHIL

(really annoyed now)

Did I say "fuck off, " Ned? I

can't talk to you right now.

NED

(BRAYING)

Hey, look .out for that first v

step. It's a doozyi

CUT TO:

RITA

Here he comes. Phill Hey, Phil!

RITA

Where ' ve you been?

-31-

PHIL

(nervous, sweat ing)

I've got to talk to you. I think

I'm losing my mind.

. RITA

I know you're losing it. What

are you doing over here? The

camera's over there.

PHIL

Slap me, Rita.

RITA

What is this?

PHIL

(INSISTENT)

Just slap me-- hard.

PHIL

I said hardl

I can't!

PHIL

Do it!

PHIL

(his cheek smarting)

Better. Almost too hard, Rita.

RITA

Are you drunk?

PHIL

No, drunk is more fun. Can I be

serious with you for a minute?

RITA

I don't know. Can you?

PHIL

Yes. I ' m being serious. I' m

having a problem-- no, I may be

having a problem.

RITA

What are you trying to say?

-32-

PHIL

I'm trying to say that if I was

having a problem, just

hypothetical ly, I ' d like to know

that you're someone I could count

on in a crisis.

RITA

(WORRIED)

What did you do last night?

LARRY

We better get started. We're

going to miss it.

PHIL

Were not going to miss it.

(indicating the other

REPORTERS)

They're going to miss it.

RITA

(EMPHATIC)

Phil. We've been out here for an

hour. We're cold and tired.

Let's just get this and get out

of here.

PHIL

Okay, put it here.

RITA

What?

PHIL

Put the camera here .

RITA

Phil , there is no tomorrow on

this one. It's Groundhog Day.

PHIL

We were in the wrong spot

yesterday .

RITA

(IRKED)

W ha t? Yesterday? What are you

talking about?

PHIL

Just trust me. Put the camera

here .

PHIL

No hurry.

LARRY

Everyone else is rolling!

RITA

I'm begging you, all right?

Gould we please just do this?

PHIL

Okay, let's do it.

PHIL

Roll tape.

LARRY

(MUMBLING)

Prima donnas.

LARRY

Rolling.

-34-

PHIL

(to camera)

We ll, it's Groundhog Day-- again--

and you know what that means.

Everybody's here on Gobbler's

Knob waiting in the cold for the

appearance of the most famous

groundhog in the world,

Punxsutawney Phil, who's going to

tell us just how much more of

this we can expect.

PHIL

My forecast is we're going to see

the groundhog peek its head out

of its hole, look around a little

bit, then he's going to come out,

scamper over to this general

area, look at the crowd for a

second, make a little burping

noise and run back into the

ground.

RITA

(whispers to Larry)

That's it. I'm going to kill

him.

PHIL

O k ay ? And here we go--

-35-

RITA

(HISSES)

Phil!

BUSTER

He came out, and he saw his

shadow. Sorry, ladies and

gentlemen, but it looks like it's

going to be a long winter.

RITA

(at a loss)

For Channel 9 News, this is Rita

Hanson in Punxsutawney.

CUT TO:

- LATER

PHIL

(on the phone)

I know there's a blizzard, but I

have to get a call through to my

doctor in Pittsburgh. It's a

medical emergency. . . .No, don't

give me the Punxsutawney Fire

Department. When do you think

the long distance lines will be

working again?. . . But what if we

don't have a tomorrow? We didn't

have one today, my friend...

and don't forget your booties

because it's COOOLD out there

today.

PHIL AND SIDEKICK

It's cold out there everyday.

What is this -- Miami Beach?

CUT TO:

PHIL

(with forced good

HUMOR)

. . . S o according to Mr. Groundhog

I guess we can expect six more

weeks of winter. It's not very

scientific, but it sure is fun.

Hey, wait a second. If he's

right, I could be out of a job!

(mock laugh)

For Channel 9 News, this is Phil

Connors in Punxsutawney .

PHIL

How was that?

RITA

(PLEASED)

It was good. A little smarmy for

my taste, but I guess that's what

sells.

PHIL

Could I talk to you about a

matter that is not work related?

RITA

You never talk about work.

PHIL

Do you know what I did last

night?

RITA

Do I want to know?

-39-

PHIL

I destroyed my hotel room.

RITA

You whatl This is not some kind

of rock and roll tour. We don't

have the budget for that--

PHIL

No, it's okay. This morning it

was all right again. That's what

I have to talk to you about.

RITA

Phil, what are you doing?

CUT TO:

RITA

(to waiter)

Could I have some coffee, please?

WAITER

(EXITING)

I'll be back to take your order.

RITA

Thanks.

(to Phil)

Okay, so tell me. How'd you know

where to put the camera?

PHIL

Because I've done it before.

RITA

I know, but the groundhog doesn't

do exactly the same thing every

year, does he?

-40-

PHIL

I ' m not talking about last year.

I ' m talking about today. I lived

it before.

RITA

You're having deja vu?

PHIL

Big time. Rita, I know it's nuts

but I keep reliving the same day

o ve r and over-- Groundhog Day--

today. This is the third time.

RITA

(completely skeptical)

Uh-huh. I'm waiting for the

punchline.

PHIL

No, really. It's like today

never happened. I shaved my head

last night, today its all grown

back. I could probably cut off

my limbs, one by one, and - pop!

They'd grow back. Just like a

starfish. I probably don't even

have to floss?

RITA

I'm wracking my brain, but I

can't even begin to imagine why

you'd make up something like

this.

PHIL

'Cause I'm not making it up. I'm

asking for your help.

RITA

Okay, I'll bite. What do you

want me to do?

PHIL

The truth? I'd 1ike you to spend

the next 24 hours with me and

don't leave my side for a second.

RITA

I see. You know, Phil, you can

charm all the little P.A.'s at

the station, all the secretaries,

and even some of the weekend

a nchors, but not me-- not in a

thousand years.

-41-

PHIL

Wa it a second--

RITA

Not if I was dying and your

breath was the only cure; not if

having your child was the only

way to preserve the human race.

Just get it out of your head

because it is NOT GOING TO

HAPPEN!

PHIL

So much for the truth.

LARRY

(to Rita)

You ready? We better get going

if we're going to stay ahead of

the weather.

RITA

Yeah, , I ' m . ready, Larry.

(EXITING)

Good luck, Phil.

CUT TO:

NEUROLOGIST

No spots, no tumors, no lesions,

no clots, no aneurisms.

Everything looks fine and dandy

to me, Mr. Connors. Have you

considered psychiatric help?

CUT TO:

-42-

PSYCHOLOGIST

(not too confident)

That's kind of an unusual

problem, Mr. Connors. Most of my

work is with couples and

families.

PHIL

Yeah, but you're still a

psychologist. You must have had

some course in school that

covered this kind of thing.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Sort of, I guess. Abnormal

Psychology.

PHIL

So based on that what would you

say?

PSYCHOLOGIST

(HESITANT)

I ' d say that maybe you're -- I

don't know -- a little delusional.

PHIL

You're saying this thing is not

really happening to me?

PSYCHOLOGIST

Uh-huh.

PHIL

Then how do I know this

conversation is really happening?

PSYCHOLOGIST

I guess you don't.

PHIL

Then forget about me paying you.

PSYCHOLOGIST

(RELIEVED)

I'm afraid that's all the time we

have, Mr. Connors.

PHIL

Wait! Are you saying I'm crazy?

-43-

PSYCHOLOGIST

(humoring him)

Not necessarily. If it concerns

you we should schedule our next

session as soon as possible.

How's tomorrow for you?

CUT TO:

SCIENTIST

(AUTHORITATIVELY)

Now if the moon exerts a

gravitational pull strong enough

to cause the tides, .then it may

be theoretically possible for a

Black Hole or a Singularity of

sufficient magnitude to actually

bend time enough to cause it to

fold back ,on itself.

PHIL

You think that's a realistic

possibility?

SCIENTIST

(STERNLY)

All right! I think someone may

just need a little visit to the

Assistant Principal's office!

Get back in your seats. The bell

has not rung yet.

SCIENTIST

(to Phil)

Well, I ' m speaking purely

hypothetically.

CUT TO:

-44-

TEACH ER

So the princess picked up the

frog and kissed him.

TEACHER

Now who can tell me what happened

when the princess kissed the

frog.

LITTLE BOY

Her lips got slimed!

T EACHER

Okay, come on now. What happened

when she kissed the frog?

LITTLE GIRL

The princess kissed the frog and

the spell got broke and he turned

into a handsome prince and they

got married and lived happily

ever after.

TEACHER

That's right.

CUT TO:

PHIL

Gus, what would you do if there

was no tomorrow?

-45-

GUS

You mean like if the world was

gonna end?

PHIL

No, I mean like if it was never

going to end. If everyday was

the same and you were stuck here

and you couldn't get out and

nothing you did mattered?

GUS

You're right. Everyday is the

same, I can't get out of here and

nothin' I do matters.

V RALPH

No, he's askin1 you a question,

ya idiot.

GUS

What was the question?

RALPH

What if nothing mattered?! Jeez,

I know what I'd do. I ' d j ust

spend all my time drivin' fast,

gettin1 loaded and gettin' laid.

That's it.

PHIL

That's it. It just doesn't get

any better than this, does it?

Good friends, good conversation

and quality brew. Drink up,

boys.

CUT TO:

RALPH

(fumbling with his

CARKEYS)

Where you stayin', Phil? We'll

drop you off.

PHIL

Hey, friends don't let friends

drive drunk. Give me your keys.

-46-

RALPH

Thanks , man .

PHIL

It's nothing. Get in.

PHIL

(starting the ear)

Seatbelts.

PHIL

This is great, Ralph!

RALPH

Oh, hey, take a left!

RALPH

You missed it!

PHIL

No problem --

PHIL

So many rules --

-47-

RALPH

You can say that again.

PHIL

"Don't do this--"

PHIL (V.O.)

"Don't do that -- "

All right! Try and stop us, you

mothers !

PHIL

No more rules!

RALPH

No more rules!

RALPH

(looking back)

That's two!

PHIL

Having a good time?

RALPH

I'm having a great time!

GUS

Hey, uh --

PHIL

Phil.

-48-

GUS

Yeah, Phil-- like the groundhog.

PHIL

Right.

GUS

Hey, Phil? How're we going to

get out of this?

PHIL

(CALMLY)

Gus, you're just going to have to

trust me on this one.

PHIL AND RALPH

Yahooooo!

BLACK OUT:

DEEJAY

Okay, campers, rise and shine,

and don't forget your booties

today.

PHIL AND SIDEKICK

It's cold out there everyday.

What is this-- Miami Beach?

-49-

CUT TO:

MRS. LANCASTER

W o u l d you--

PHIL

(URGENTLY)

Yes, I would like some coffee;

the weather is going to be cold

and overcast with blizzard

conditions moving in later today;

and yes, I will be staying an

extra day.

MRS. LANCASTER

(BAFFLED)

Why thank you.

PHIL

Mrs. Lancaster, has anyone been

around here looking for me this

morning? Maybe a state official,

blue coat, hat, gun, nightstick,

badge, driving a late-model Ford

br Chevy, black and white with

bub ble lights on top--

MRS. LANCASTER

(SHOCKED)

No, no one like that-- I .don't--

Will they be?

PHIL

(greatly relieved)

Apparently not.

CUT TO:

-50-

NED (O.C.)

Hey, Phil!

NED

Phil! Phil Connors!

PHIL

Ned! Ned Ryerson! Ned the Head!

CUT TO:

PHIL

You here to see the groundhog?

NANCY

Can you think of another reason

anybody'd be out here at dawn on

a freezing day?

PHIL

What's your name?

NANCY

Nancy Taylor. And you are--

PHIL

Where'd you go to high school?

-51-

NANCY

What is this?

PHIL

(PLAYFUL)

High school?

NANCY

Lincoln High school. In

Pittsburgh. Who are you?

PHIL

Who was your twelfth grade

English teacher?

NANCY

Are you kidding?

PHIL

I'm waiting.

NANCY

.Mrs. Walsh.

PHIL

Walsh. Nancy, Lincoln, Walsh.

NANCY

Is this some kind of come-on?

PHIL

I'm not really sure. We'll have

to see.

CUT TO:

RITA

Is this some new fad diet? Don't

you worry about cholesterol?

-52-

PHIL

I don't worry about anything

anymore.

RITA

What makes you so special?

Everybody worries about

something.

PHIL

That's exactly what makes me so

special.

PHIL

(with his mouth full)

What?

RITA

"The wretch, concentered all

in self,

Living, shall forfeit fair

renown,

And doubly dying, shall go

down to the vile dust from

whence he sprung,

Unwept, unhonored, and

unsung." Sir Walter Scott.

PHIL

(stares at her for a

long moment)

"There was a young man from

Na n t uc k e t-- "

RITA

That's really funny. When are

you going to grow up, Phil?

PHIL

At this rate-- never.

(he pulls out a pack of

CIGARETTES)

Okay if I smoke?

RITA

You really do have a death wish,

don't you?

PHIL

Just the opposite, Rita. I have

a life wish. I'm just trying to

enjoy it. Taking pleasure in the

little things. Don't you ever

just want to cut loose and go

wild?

-53-

RITA

I wouldn't even know what it

means to go wild.

PHIL

Yeah, well, that's where I come

in. Going wild is one of my

specialties. Last night I got

completely loaded and drove head-

on into a police car.

RITA

(DISBELIEVING)

Oh, really? You look pretty good

this morning.

PHIL

That's my point. I know you

won't believe me, but we could do

anything we want today and it

wouldn't matter one bit.

Absolutely no consequences.

Complete and total freedom.

RITA

And how. . , do we manage that?

PHIL

You leave that to me. Why don't

you send Larry back and hang out

with me for the rest of the day?

You never make it through that

blizzard anyway.

RITA

I'll take my chances with the

-weather. But you have a good

time.

PHIL

Don't worry. I plan to.

Yeah, yeah, I ' d like that --

Phil!

CUT TO:

WOMAN

(MOANS)

Oh, Phil.

PHIL

Oh , Rita .

NANCY

(COLD)

Who's Rita?

PHIL

(CAUGHT)

No one. It's just something I

say when I make love. You know --

"Orita", "Orighta"-- it's like

"Oh, baby" or something.

NANCY

(not entirely

CONVINCED)

Oh.

PHIL

(corrects her)

O-rita.

CUT TO:

-56-

MRS. LANCASTER

Isn't it a wonderful collection?

PHIL

(not looking up)

Yes, it is. You don't usually

find this many trashy novels in

one place.

MRS. LANCASTER

You can take a book up to your

room if you like.

PHIL

No, thank you. I've actually

read them all. I was just

rereading some of the dirty

parts.

MRS. LANCASTER

(WORRIED)

How long will you be staying with

us, Mr. Connors?

PHIL

Indefinitely. I've already been

here for 211 days.

MRS. LANCASTER

(humoring him)

Really? That's quite a long

time, isn't it. I hope you're

finding things to do in our

little town.

PHIL

(CASUALLY)

Yes, well, I'm getting a little

tired of casual sex so today I

thought I'd rob a bank and buy

myself a really expensive car.

-57-

CUT TO:

PHIL

(SHOUTS)

All right, freeze!! Drop your

guns J!

PHIL

You guys ever been held up

before?

(they shake their

HEADS)

It's kind of exciting, isn't it?

FIRST GUARD

(FRIGHTENED)

I guess so. Something to tell

the kids about.

PHIL

Yeah. By the way, I'm Phil.

FIRST GUARD

Herman.

S E C O N D GUARD

Felix.

PHIL

(shaking their hands)

Herman and Felix. Okay. Take it

easy, boys. And thanks.

CUT TO:

SALESMAN

A real beauty, huh. We picked it

PHIL

I'll take it. How much?

SALESMAN

Well, the sticker says $62,999

bu t if you want--

PHIL

I'll tell you what. I'll give

you $70,000 if you just knock off

the car salesman stuff and let me

get out of here with my car.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LARAINE

(very self-conscious)

I thought we were going to a

costume party.

PHIL

Yeah, we are, we are. But first

I have this movie theater fantasy

I want to talk to you about.

CUT TO:

-59-

CUT TO:

I

CUT TO:

PHIL

(more to himself than

to Angie)

Yeah, but eventually you' d just

get tired of screwing around and

then you'd want a real

relationship, wouldn't you?

ANGIE

I don't know.

PHIL

Get down, Brunoi

(CONTINUING)

Someone decent, someone who you

respected, who respects you.

-60-

ANGIE

I guess so.

PHIL

Down , Bruno !

(still musing)

It's tough to find a relationship

like that, especially if your

time is kind of limited. But you

still have to try, don't you?

(the dog again)

Bruno! I told you! Off the bed!

PHIL

There ' s got to be more to it than

this.

CUT TO :

RITA

You look good. I mean, it came

o ut all right. How'd you know

where to put the camera?

PHIL

Psychic. So did you have a nice

evening?

RITA

(GUARDED)

I just had a sandwich, watched

some TV and went to bed.

PHIL

I got my whole body tattooed and

part ied all night with some

nymphomaniac biker chicks.

RITA

(SKEPTICAL)

Sounds wholesome. Were those the

new 24-hour disappearing tattoos

or can I see them?

PHIL

No, they're gone. Rita, if you

only had one day to live, what

would you do with it?

-61-

RITA

I don't know, Phil. What are you

dying of?

PHIL

No, I mean like what if the

entire world was about to

explode?

RITA

I ' d just want to know where to

p ut the camera. What are you

looking for, Phil-- a date for

the weekend?

PHIL

No, I just want to know you

better. What do you like, what

do you want, what do you think

about, what kind of men are you

interested in, what do you do for

fun?

RITA

(she stops)

Is this real or are you just

going to make me feel like a

fool?

PHIL

I'm just trying to talk to you

like a normal person. Isn't this

how normal people talk?

RITA

Close.

PHIL

Okay, so talk to me. C'mon, I'll

buy you a cup of coffee.

CUT TO:

RITA

I guess I want what everybody

wants-- you know, career, love,

marriage, children. So far I

don't have any of it.

-62-

PHIL

You have a career.

RITA

I have a job. Doing stories on

the Punxsutawney groundhog is not

my ultimate goal. No offense.

PHIL

How about the other stuff? You

seeing anybody?

RITA

This is getting too personal. I

don't think I ' m ready to discuss

these things with you. What

about you? What do you want?

PHIL

What I really want is someone

like you.

RITA

O h , please--

PHIL

Why not?

RITA

Phil, you know, you have so much

talent and ability. If you'd

just drop the attitude and act

like a decent human being, then

maybe I ' d --

(she hesitates)

PHIL

You'd what?

RITA

I don't know what.

PHIL

Then maybe you'd like me?

RITA

I don't know. It's sort of like

the way I feel about UFO's. I'd

have to see it to believe it.

-63-

LARRY

(to Rita)

You ready? We better get going

if we're going to stay ahead of

the weather.

RITA

Yeah, I'll be right out, Larry.

PHIL

(to Rita)

Why don't you stay for a while?

The road's going to be closed

anyway. Do you really want to be

stuck in the van with Larry for

three hours?

RITA

I've got to get back. I'll see

you later.

CUT TO:

PHIL

Well, you heard it right from the

groundhog's mouth. Bundle up

good, 'cause it's going to be a

long winter-- at least in

Punxsutawney. Reporting for

Channel 9, this is Phil Connors.

RITA

That was great. How did you know

THE--

PHIL

(PREOCCUPIED)

I have to go now. There's

something I have to do.

-64-

PHIL

(acting surprised)

Oh, hi, Rita. You still here?

RITA

(GLUM)

The van won't start. Larry's

working on it.

PHIL

(INNOCENT)

Wouldn't you know it. Buy you a

drink?

RITA

Okay.

PHIL

(to the bartender)

Jack Daniels.

BARTENDER

RITA

Tequila,with lime. Gold, if

you've got it.

Tequila with lime, gold if you've

got it.

BARTENDER

For you miss?

RITA

Same for me, please.

PHIL

(to Rita)

What should we toast to?

RITA

Your call.

PHIL

To the groundhog!

RITA

I always drink to world peace.

CUT TO:

BARTENDER

Take your order?

PHIL

Tequila with lime, gold if you've

RITA

Same for me, please.

PHIL

To world peace.

RITA

To world peace.

CUT TO:

PHIL

You like your job?

RITA

It's okay. I think it could be

really challenging. Of course

it's about a million miles from

where I started out in college.

PHIL

You weren't in broadcasting?

RITA

At Bryn Mawr? No, uh-uh.

"Believe it or not, I studied

Nineteenth Century French Poetry.

PHIL

(laughs good-naturedly)

Really? What a waste of time.

RITA

This is terrific.

PHIL

Best fudge in town.

RITA

How do you know so much about

Punxsutawney?

PHIL

I like small towns. I think they

engender real community more than

big cities.

RITA

That is so true! I've always

thought that, too.

PHIL

No kidding. Here-- try the white

chocolate.

RITA

Oh, yuk, don't make me sick.

PHIL

(making mental note)

No white chocolate.

RITA

There's something so familiar

about this. Do you ever have

deja vu?

-68-

LARRY

(irate, to Rita)

I don't believe it. Someone

bought every distributor cap in

this town. We're going to be

stuck here all night1

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PHIL

What?

RITA

I ' m just amazed. And I'm not

easily amazed.

PHIL

About what?

-69-

RITA

How you can start a day with one

kind of expectation and end up so

completely different.

PHIL

Do you like how this day is

turning out?

RITA

Yes. I like it very much.

They stop dn front of Phil's hotel. She turns to him.

RITA

You could never have planned a

day like this, but it couldn't

have been more perfect.

PHIL

You're wrong. I've been planning

this day for weeks.

Rita ignores the remark and hugs him. Phil tries to kiss her

but she gently puts her fingers to his lips, stopping him.

INT. VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS

Rita hugs him again and starts to exit.

RITA

Thanks. See you tomorrow.

PHIL

Tomorrow? Wait, aren't you going

to come up to my room for a

while?

RITA

(very reluctant)

I don't know, Phil--

PHIL

Noreason to end a perfect day.

RITA

(DECIDING)

Well-- we better not.

PHIL

No, you should. The, uh, the

poetry! I've got some books,

Rimbaud, Beaudelaire, we could

-70-

RITA

Thanks, but --

PHIL

(seeing it all slip

AWAY)

Please come, Rita. It'll be --

RITA

(DEFINITE)

Phil, I'm tired. We can be

together tomorrow.

PHIL

(getting desperate)

But there is no tomorrow for me!

RITA

(ADAMANT)

Let's not ruin it, Phil. There's

no way I ' m sleeping with you

tonight.

PHIL

Why not? Rita, I love you!

RITA

You don't even know me!

PHIL

(grabs her hand)

Please! You have to!

RITA

What's wrong with you!

RITA

(shaking her head)

Oh, no. I can't believe I fell

for it. This whole day was just

one long set-up. And I ate

fudge. Yucchh! I hate fudge.

PHIL

No, it was real. I love you.

RITA

Stop saying that! Do you really

expect me to trust you? The

whole secretarial pool is a Phil

Connors recovery group.

That's for making me care about

you.

FIRST HUSTLER

Oh, yeah? So how come I ain't

PHIL

I don't know. I seen you.

SECOND HUSTLER

So what's your name?

They call me-- Punxsutawney Phil.

SECOND HUSTLER

Punxsutawney Phil? Like the

groundhog.

PHIL

Yeah, like the groundhog.

CUT TO:

PHIL

(CYNICALLY)

This is one of the most pitiful

spectacles known to civilization.

With one nod from a filthy rodent

if they hated the winter so

damned much, why don't they move

You got a problem, buddy?

PHIL

(out of control)

Yeah, I got a problem, buddy! I

can't stand this place anymore!

I can't stand this street and I

can't stand the fourteen bars and

the five banks and the one star

food and the bad weather and the

"quaint" little shops and most of

all, I can't stand anything--

ANYTHING-- with a groundhog on

it.

COP

(CALMLY)

Okay. Then let's see what we can

do about getting you out of here.

You got a name?

PHIL

(eyes downcast)

Phil.

COP

Phil. Like the groundhog!

PHIL

Yeah, like the--

(he stops as if struck)

--groundhog.

LARRY

(turning to Rita)

The guy's nuts. He's out of his

gourd.

RITA

Let him finish, then I'll call

the station.

PHIL

(to camera)

There is no way this winter is

ever going to end as long as that

groundhog keeps seeing his shadow

everyday. I don't see any other

way out. He's got to be stopped

and I've got to stop him. For

Channel 9 news, this is Phil

Connors.

CUT TO:

WOMAN

He ain't there.

WOMAN

You can wait all night, but he

ain't coming out. He don't live

there. They keep him in the

library.

WOMAN

Plug him once for me.

-78-

CUT TO:

BYSTANDER

Is he all right?

LIBRARIAN

He's just fine. That's two

inches of bullet-proof glass

there. You can't be too careful

in this day and age.

RITA

Where were you this morning? How

could you possibly miss the

PHIL

(at the end of his

ROPE)

I've come to the end of me, Rita.

There's only one way out now.

Just remember/we had a wonderful

day together once.

B USTER

(to the groundhog)

There you go, ol' buddy. Good

job. Hey! He smiled at me. See

that?

FIRST OFFICIAL

Right.

-80-

BUSTER

(securing the cage)

There, little fella.

OTHER OFFICIAL

Hi, there, mister. Something I

can do you for?

FIRST OFFICIAL

Hey! What 're you -- !

RITA

(SHOUTS)

Larry!

BUSTER

Jake! Call the police, and get

the word out. Somebody kidnapped

Phil. We're going after him.

Come on, Tommy!

RITA

Let's go! Phil just snatched the

groundhog!

LARRY

(MUTTERS)

Probably some kind of gerbil

deal. Pervert.

CUT TO:

-81-

PHIL

Coming to the end of the trail,

Phil. Then we're going out in a

blaze of glory.

BUSTER

Nobody takes my groundhog and

gets away with it.

..  .

RITA

(very upset)

What is he doing? What can he be

thinking? He must1 ve just --

snapped.

LARRY

This oughta be good.

BUSTER

Okay! I know this road. There's

no way off ' cept the way we come

up.

FIRST OFFICIAL

All right! We got him now.

Okay, pal. It's showtime.

RITA

I ' m sorry. What was that again?

PHIL

I'm a god.

RITA

You're God?

PHIL

No, I'm A god. Not THE God-- at

least I don't think I am.

RITA

That's reassuring. For a mintute

there I thought you might be

crazy.

PHIL

No, it's true. It's the only

possible explanation. I'm a

supernatural being.

RITA

Because you survived a car wreck?

-85-

WAITER

Are you ready to order?

PHIL

(to Rita, ignoring the

WAITER)

Not just the car wreck! I didn't

just blow up yesterday, you know.

I've been run over, drowned,

crushed, stabbed, shot,

electrocuted, poisoned, frozen,

burn ed, and asphyxiated--

RITA

Really?

PHIL

--but I always wake up the next

day without a scratch, without

even a headache. I'm telling

you, I ' m immortal.

WAITER

The special today is blueberry

waffles.

RITA

Why are you telling me this?

WAITER

(SHRUGS)

Because some people like

blueberry waffles.

RITA

(to the waiter)

No t you-- him.

PHIL

Because I want you to believe in

me.

RITA

You're not a god, Phil. Take my

word for it. This is twelve

years of Catholic school talking.

WAITER

I could come back if you're not

ready.

PHIL

How do you know I'm not a god?

-86-

RITA

Please.

PHIL

How do you know?

RITA

Because it's not possible.

WAITER

I'll come back.

PHIL

Hey, Billy!

PHIL

This is Bill. He's been a waiter

for three years because he left

Penn State and had to find work.

He likes the town, he paints toy

soldiers, and he's gay.

WAITER

I am notl

RITA

What are you doing?

PHIL

This is Doris Kleiser and her

fiance Fred.

DORIS

Do I know you?

PHIL

They're supposed to get married

tonight but Doris is having

second thoughts.

FRED

What!

RITA

Lovely ring.

DORIS

Thanks.

-87-

PHIL

This is Ralph. Say "Hi," Rita.

RALPH

Don't believe I've had the--

PHIL

Ralph hates his life here and

wants to drive around town

smashing into policemen.

RALPH

Well, who don't?

RITA

This is some kind of trick.

PHIL

Yes, it's a trick. But maybe the

real God cheats, too. Maybe God

isn't omnipotent-- he's just had

a lot of practice.

RITA

How about that guy?

PHIL

Tom. Worked in the coal mine

til they shut it down.

RITA

Her?

PHIL '

Nancy. Went to Lincoln High

School in Pittsburgh. Takes

herself out to lunch once a week.

RITA

How do you know these people!

PHIL

I told you the truth. In five

seconds there's going to be a

grease fire in the kitchen.

Five, four--

RITA

This is nuts.

-88-

PHIL

--three, two, one.

RITA

(trying to puzzle it

OUT)

Okay, enough. Let's just sit

down and think for a second.

(they sit)

What do you know about me, Phil?

Do you know me, too?

PHIL

I know all about you, Rita. I

know you like producing, but hope

for better than Channel 9,

Pittsburgh.

RITA

Everyone knows that.

PHIL

You like boats but not the ocean.

There's a lake you go to in the

summer with your family, up in

the mountains, with an old wooden

dock and a boathouse with boards

missing in the roof, and a place

you used to crawl underneath to

be alone, and at night you'd look

up and see the stars. You're a

sucker for Rocky Road, Marlon

Brando, and French poetry.

You're wonderfully generous;

you're kind to strangers, and

children; and when you stand in

the snow, you look like an angel.

RITA

How are you doing this?

PHIL

I told you! I wake up every day

right here, right in

Punxsutawney, and it's always

February second and I can't turn

it off. If you still don't

bel iev e me, listen--

RITA

B u t , Phil--

-89-

PHIL

Listen! In ten seconds Larry is

going to walk through that door

and take you away from me.

RITA

Larry?

PHIL

But you can't let him. Please

believe me. You've got to

believe me.

RITA

I don't --

PHIL

Look.

LARRY

(to Rita)

You ready? We better get going

if we're going to stay ahead of

the weather.

RITA

(READING)

" . . . stay ahead of the weather. "

LARRY

What ' s that?

CUT TO:

PHIL

Afer I got over the shock, it was

kind of fun for the first year or

two. I had anything I wanted.

Except you, of course.

-90-

RITA

How did this start?

PHIL

I don't know. I just woke up.

Just like always.

NED

Hey, Phil! Phil Connors 1

PHIL

Rita, this is Ned Ryerson. He's

an asshole.

NED

He remembers me!

PHIL

Trust me on that one.

CUT TO:

RITA

This is great.

PHIL

No, it isn't. You hate fudge.

. RITA

Just how well do we know each

other?

PHIL

I told you. I know everybody.

RITA

Did we ever...you know?

PHIL

(TEASING)

Did we ever! You were an animal.

-91-

RITA

Come on.

PHIL

You're European trained, aren't

you.

RITA

(BLUSHING)

Phil! It's not funny.

PHIL

You weren't interested.

RITA

(RELIEVED)

Okay.

RITA

Not that it would've been so

awful.

PHIL

I understand.

RITA

I just had to know whether to

smack you or not.

PHIL

You did.

RITA

Good.

CUT TO:

PHIL

So do you believe any of this?

RITA

I don't know. I don't know how

else you could know so much.

Maybe it is really happening.

-92-

PHIL

I used to try to stay up all

night sometimes. I thought if I

could stay conscious I could

figure out what was going on, or

at least hang onto something from

the day before. But I gave up on

that a long time ago.

RITA

It sounds so-- lonely.

PHIL

(trying to shrug it

OFF)

It's not that bad. You get used

to it.

RITA

Maybe I should spend the rest of

the day with you-- as an

objective witness. Just to see

what happens. Okay?

PHIL

Yeah, sure. That'd be okay.

CUT TO:

PHIL

It's not in the wrist so much as

the fingers. Be the hat.

RITA

It would take me a year to get

good at this.

PHIL

Uh-uh. Six months. Four, five

hours a day.

RITA

Is this what you do with

eternity?

-93-

PHIL

Now you know. It's like waiting

for a bus that never comes . You

should see me play pool -- and

bowling, juggling, hacky sack.

I can ride a unicycle.

PHIL

I'll get it!

PHIL

Hi, Marty. $11.75 including the

delivery charge, right?

PIZZA GUY

U h hh h --

RITA

(opening the pizza box)

MMMM. Pepperoni and olives. My

favorite .

PHIL

Of course. I told you, I know

everything .

RITA

(taking a bite of

PIZZA)

I don ' t think I ' d want to know

everything that ' s going to

happen. I like to be surprised.

PHIL

That's not the worst part.

RITA

What's the worst part?

PHIL

The worst part is starting over

everyday. Tomorrow you won't

remember any of this. You'll go

back to treating me like a

complete jerk --

RITA

No --

PHIL

It's not your fault. I am a

jerk.

-94-

RITA

No, you're not.

PHIL

Okay, I ' m not. It really doesn't

make a lot of difference. I've

killed myself so many times, I

don't even exist anymore. I'm

just completely empty.

RITA

Or completely clean.

PHIL

If you're going to be this

positive all the time I may have

to rough you up a little.

RITA

Wait! Have we done this before?

PHIL

Which part?

RITA

You getting me up here, the card

gam e, the pizza--

PHIL

No, this is the first time.

RITA

(EXCITED)

Well?

PHIL

Well, what?

RITA

Well how does it feel to be doing

something completely new?

PHIL

Good. Really good.

DISSOLVE TO:

-95-

RITA

Sometimes I wish I had a thousand

lifetimes. One to be a great

journalist. One to, I don't

know, go back to school, study

art, or auto mechanics. One just

to take care of all the busywork,

you know, pay the bills, get my

car tuned up. One to be the wild

woman of Borneo. One to be

Mother Theresa. Maybe it's not

a curse, Phil. It all just

depends on how you look at it.

RITA

I want you to know, it's been a

really nice day for me.

PHIL

Me, too.

RITA

Maybe, if it's not too boring for

you, we could do it again.

PHIL

I hope so.

RITA

You're still here!

PHIL

I know.

RITA

I thought you were supposed to

disappear-- or I was or

something.

PHIL

Not 'til six.

RITA

You rat!

-96-

PHIL

I never said midnight--

RITA

You knew I was waiting for

midnight!

PHIL

But I never said it.

RITA

Oh, I can't believe you!

(she slugs him with a

PILLOW)

I didn't know this was going to

take all night!

PHIL

Does that mean you're going?

RITA

No.

DISSOLVE TO:

RITA

I'm sorry.

PHIL

It's okay to go to sleep you

know. I promise I won't touch

you-- much.

RITA

No, it's all right. I'm not

tired. What were you saying?

PHIL

I was saying that the cow was

eventually returned to it's

rightful owner.

RITA

(drifting off)

Really?

-97-

PHIL

That's right.

PHIL

What I was going to say was, I

think you're the kindest,

sweetest, prettiest, most

wonderful girl I ever met in my

life.

PHIL

Shhhh. That's good.

(satisfied she's still

ASLEEP)

I could never tell you this, but

from the first minute I looked at

you I wanted to just hold you

close and be with you forever.

iEverytime I -saw you around the

station, I thought my heart was

going to explode. I used to

dream about us being together.

In my dream you loved me as much

as I loved you and we didn't have

to say anything but I knew you

understood everything.

PHIL

I know a guy like me could never

deserve to have someone like you,

but if I did, I swear I would

love you for the rest of my life.

RITA

(HALF-ASLEEP)

Did you say something?

PHIL

Good-night, Rita.

RITA

Good-night, Phil.

PHIL

Rita?

RITA

Oh, hi, Phil.

PHIL

Thought you might like some--

RITA

Thanks!

PHIL

Careful, it's hot. Larry?

LARRY

(surprised, mutters)

Yeah, great.

RITA

We're just setting up.

PHIL

You know, I bumped into Buster

Greene, he kind of runs this

thing, and he tipped me off that

we might get a better shot over

there.

RITA

Really?

-99-

PHIL

I mean, maybe we should go for

it. What do you think?

RITA

Sounds good to me. Larry?

LARRY

Sure, why not?

RITA

All right. Thanks, Phil. Good

work.

PHIL

I'll get that.

Not bad, Mr. Connors. You say

this is your first lesson?

PHIL

Technically, yes.

CUT TO:

-101-

CUT TO:

PHIL

In fact, the groundhog's

legendary ability to predict the

weather may be more than just the

German folklore of the region.

Higher temperatures trigger

hormonal changes in the

testosterone levels of male

groundhogs, which may in fact

wake them from hibernation and

send them out to battle with

other males ;for mating rights.

So, the truth is they're not

looking for their shadows,

they're looking for groundhog

chicks.

CUT TO:

PHIL

Groundhog Day, February second,

also known as Candlemas Day or

the Feast of the Purification of

the Virgin Mary, the day Mary

first came to the temple for

ritual blessings following the

birth of the infant Jesus, and

celebrated since the Middle Ages

by the sacramental lighting of

candles. Hence the old Scottish

couplet which long predates the

.American groundhog tradition: "If

Candlemas dawns bright and clear,

there'll be two winters in the

year."

LARRY

Is he making this stuff up?

RITA

(RIVETED)

Shhhhh.

CUT TO:

PHIL

But what if the rules changed?

What if none of your actions had

consequences?

RITA

There would still be an absolute

morality. There has to be an

absolute good, regardless of the

circumstances.

PHIL

Oh, is that so, Miss Plato? Then

let me ask you this. Where does

this "absolute good" come from?

From the sky?

-103-

RITA

I don't know. From my freshman

Philosophy course, I guess.

PHIL

What?

RITA

Nothing. I just can't believe

you're such a fine sculptor.

PHIL

I gotta go.

Where do you have to go in

I got piano and then drums.

FRED

Thanks, Mr. Connors. You're a

you seem to be Punxsutawney ' s

leading citizen.

PHIL

What do you want to know?

RITA

Who are you?

I really don't know.

RITA

No, there's something going on

with you.

Okay, I wake up in Punxsutawney

You want to know what's really

amazing? I've been waiting for

exist has kept me alive. How's

It's not true. It's not. It

can't be true. Rita? Rita!

RITA

(STRETCHING

LUXURIOUSLY)

Mmmm. Morning.

PHIL

You're here! My god! I can't

believe you're here!

RITA

Glad to see you, too.

PHIL

No! It's happened. Don't you

get it? It's tomorrow! It's --

DEEJAY

. . . still shoveling put the

highways, but if you're walking,

it's a beautiful day.

S IDEKICK

Yeah, the snow kind of cleaned

e ve r yt h in g up--

DEEJAY

--except your mouth.

PHIL

I love those guys.

RITA

Are you always this jolly in the

morning?

PHIL

No groundhog! Rita! They're all

gone!

RITA

You must've had some dream.

-1 1 9 -

PHIL

Did I just dream it?

RITA

Phi l? Phil!

PHIL (O.C.)

Yeah!!!!

PHIL

It really happened! You're

really here!

PHIL

You're really actually here.

RITA

(LAUGHING)

I'm here, I'm here!

PHIL

Let's go!

RITA

Where're we going?

PHIL

Anywhere! Everywhere!

CUT TO:

MRS. LANCASTER

Oh, my!

PHIL

Florence! Say hello to Rita.

She loves me.

MRS. LANCASTER

I'm not surprised.

A MAN

Phil! Good morning!

A LADY

Mr. Connors. I wanted to thank

you.

PHIL

That's all right. I--

FLORIST

Phil, here. I want you to have

these.

PHIL

Thanks, Carl.

PHIL (V.O.)

And so began my final lifetime,

and ended the longest winter on

record. I would find myself no

longer able to affect the chain

of events in this town, but I did

learn something about time. You

can waste time, you can kill

time, you can do time, but if you

use it wisely, there's never

enough of it. So you'd better

make the most of the time you've

got.

PHIL (V.O.)

Larry never got through the

blizzard, so none of my groundhog

reports ever made it on the air.

But Rita and I-- we lived happily

ever after.

NED

But Phil told me you were his

accountant!

LARRY

Look, I told you! He's nuts!

NED

Let me just tell you about single

premium life--

THE END
