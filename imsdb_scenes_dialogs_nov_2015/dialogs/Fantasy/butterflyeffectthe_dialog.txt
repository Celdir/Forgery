"THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT"

Screenplay by

J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress

SHOOTING DRAFT

EVAN

(as he writes)

If anyone finds this, then I guess

my plan didn't work and I'm already

dead...

EVAN

But if I can just go back to the

beginning of all this, I still might

be able to save her.

ANDREA

Okay, okay... what now?

EVAN

We're gonna be late again.

ANDREA

When did you ever care about getting

to school on time?

EVAN

We're putting up pictures for Parent's

Night.

EVAN

Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.

ANDREA

Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll

have plenty of time.

ANDREA

(re: carb)

Darn it!

EVAN

Um... can dad come this time?

ANDREA

(getting impatient)

You know the answer to that.

EVAN

Can't he come out for one day?

ANDREA

We've been over this a hundred times.

It's too dangerous for him.

EVAN

But Lenny said that his dad's

coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's

dad...

ANDREA

Here, Ev... Finish this up for me.

EVAN

All the dads are gonna be there.

ANDREA

I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not

so bad, am I?

EVAN

No.

ANDREA

Good. Because I've been waiting to

see your art projects all week and

I'd feel terrible if all you thought

about was your father not being there.

EVAN

(beat)

Done. Try it.

ANDREA

You're amazing, kiddo.

ANDREA

Okay have a great day I love you

I'll pick you up later gotta go...

MRS. BOSWELL

Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with

you!

ANDREA

I'm sorry, but can it wait til

tonight? I'm already late for work --

MRS. BOSWELL

I think you really need to see this.

MRS. BOSWELL

TOMMY! LEAVE LENNY ALONE! DON'T MAKE

ME SEND YOU TO MR. VOYTEK'S OFFICE!

MRS. BOSWELL

I was going to show this to the

principal, but I wanted to talk to

you first.

ANDREA

What is it?

MRS. BOSWELL

Yesterday I had all the children

draw pictures of what they wanted to

be when they grew up. Most of them

made drawings of what their parents

did, but this...

ANDREA

I don't understand... Evan did this?

ANDREA

Thank you for showing it to me first.

I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I

have the picture?

MRS. BOSWELL

Of course. There is one more thing,

Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for

mentioning it...

ANDREA

What?

MRS. BOSWELL

When I asked Evan about his drawing,

well, he didn't remember doing it.

ANDREA

I have to go.

LENNY

You put the mommy too far away. Mrs.

Boswell has macaroni and glue if you

wanna fix it.

TOMMY

You're such a retard!

KAYLEIGH

Mommy lives far away but she comes

and visits.

LENNY

(to Tommy)

If I'm retarded, why didn't my mommy

move away from me?

EVAN

Hey, what'd you do that for?

TOMMY

Fat little baby, crying for mommy.

EVAN

Come on, Lenny. It's not that bad.

You can still see your mom a little.

LENNY

(grateful)

Can... can... Can I have this?

EVAN

Sure. I was gonna make a new one,

anyway.

DR. REDFIELD

And you say he doesn't remember any

of it?

ANDREA

(anxious)

Not according to his teacher. It

just got me thinking about Jason and

what if Evan's inherited his father's

condition?

DR. REDFIELD

Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not

jump to conclusions. I'll run some

preliminary tests, see what we can

rule out.

DR. REDFIELD

Tell you what, bring Evan here tonight

and we'll run a CAT-scan series.

EVAN

I don't like this place, Mom. It's

creepy. Please can we go? I promise

I won't make any more bad pictures!

ANDREA

(lighthearted)

You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just

wants to give you some tests. You'll

like him.

DR. REDFIELD

Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet

you.

(to Andrea)

He's as handsome as his father.

EVAN

(stunned)

You know my father?

ANDREA

That's why I wanted you to come here,

Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a

background in memory loss.

EVAN

My father has a bad memory, too?

DR. REDFIELD

(off Andrea's look)

Uh, tell you what, Evan. If it's

okay with your mother, I'd like to

run some tests. Nothing scary.

DR. REDFIELD

Okay, it might be a little scary...

ANDREA

Just tell me that Evan doesn't have

Jason's illness...

DR. REDFIELD

Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test

negative for brain disorders. But

there's something else you can try

to monitor his memory.

ANDREA

Anything.

DR. REDFIELD

A journal. Just have him write down

everything he does.

ANDREA

Why? What for?

DR. REDFIELD

It could be extremely useful to jog

his memory. See if he remembers

anything new the next day. And I'll

have the test results back in a few

days.

ANDREA

Thanks, George. I really appreciate

you watching him, he won't be any

trouble at all.

EVAN

These'll bring you luck, Crockett.

ANDREA

(into phone)

Great. I'll see you soon.

ANDREA

Evan?

ANDREA

Evan? What are you doing with that

knife?

EVAN

(scared)

What happened?

ANDREA

Honey. What were you doing with that?

EVAN

(tears welling)

I... I don't remember.

MR. MILLER

Hey, Andrea.

(to Evan)

Hello little man.

ANDREA

Thanks a lot George. Here's my work

number in case there are any problems.

MR. MILLER

(lighthearted laughter)

Whaddaya kidding? We're going to

have a great time today, right Evan?

MR. MILLER

You waiting for an invitation? The

kids are inside.

KAYLEIGH

(excited to see Evan)

Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video

camera and we're all gonna be in a

movie.

TOMMY

I don't think Evan gets to be in it --

KAYLEIGH

Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin

Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and

you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!

TOMMY

I thought I was the bad guy!

KAYLEIGH

You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.

EVAN

We're really gonna be in a movie!?

MR. MILLER

That's right, Evan, and you get to

be the star.

TOMMY

I thought I was the star.

MR. MILLER

Shut up, moron. Now get in your

costume, Evan. And you have to

promise, your bestest super-duper

promise, that this will be our little

secret. Think you can do that?

HARD CUT TO:

EVAN

Where am I? What happened? Where did

we all go?

MR. MILLER

Calm down, kid. Stand still.

EVAN

I was just somewhere else -- how did

I get here?

MR. MILLER

Quit acting like some retard or I'll

call your mother and tell her what a

naughty little shit you've been.

EVAN

Kayleigh? What happened?

EVAN

What's wrong with me?

DR. REDFIELD

Well, the good news is that the

results are negative. I've found no

evidence in the way of lesions,

hemorrhaging, tumors...

ANDREA

And the bad news?

DR. REDFIELD

Unfortunately, we've got nothing to

work with. It's harder playing

detective now.

ANDREA

But you must have something to go

on?

DR. REDFIELD

If I had to guess, I'd say the

blackouts are stress related.

ANDREA

But he's seven. What kind of stress

can he have?

DR. REDFIELD

Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got

severe coping problems about not

having a father. Did you say the

last blackout occurred when he was

with his friend's dad.

ANDREA

Come on, I doubt the answer's that

simple.

DR. REDFIELD

You'd be surprised how often they

are.

ANDREA

Well, he has been pushing me to meet

his father, but I've been putting it

off.

DR. REDFIELD

It's worth a shot. I can arrange a

controlled meeting. A careful dose

of sedatives for Jason, some security,

you and I monitoring. Evan comes in

for a quick visit and with any luck,

no more missing father complex.

ANDREA

How soon?...

EVAN

Dad lives here?

DR. REDFIELD

Not in this wing, actually. No.

ANDREA

Now your father may seem sleepy to

you, but that's just because of his

medicine, okay?

EVAN

Okay.

JASON

It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen

pictures of me, right?

EVAN

Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes

and your --

SMASH CUT TO:

JASON

(through clenched

teeth)

I... love... you.

JASON

(panicking)

He has to die! You don't understand!

It's the only way to stop it!

ANDREA

I'm sorry, Evan. I'm sorry.

FADE TO BLACK:

PRIEST

Ashes to ashes... dust to dust.

KAYLEIGH

You're better off anyway.

SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

EVAN

Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here.

What's up already?

TOMMY

Hold your horses, man. It's here

somewhere. I saw it when I was a

kid.

KAYLEIGH

(to Tommy)

We should go soon. If Dad catches us

smoking down here, we're dead.

EVAN

So let's go. This place creeps me

out.

TOMMY

I knew it had something to do with

the army.

TOMMY

Let's blow the shit out of something!

LENNY

Guys, slow up, would you?

KAYLEIGH

Evan, did I tell you? My mother said

I might be able to visit her this

summer in Orlando with her new family.

TOMMY

What did I say about mentioning that

bitch?

KAYLEIGH

(uncomfortable)

Where the hell are you taking us

anyway? Just blow something up

already.

TOMMY

Just blow something up? Are you nuts?

There's an art to mass destruction.

Would you just paint the Mona Lisa?

No. Besides, we're here already.

TOMMY

Here you go, buddy.

LENNY

(recoiling)

What? No frigging way, man. I'm not

touching that thing.

TOMMY

The hell you aren't. Anyone of us

does it, you'll puss out and narc

for sure.

LENNY

Ain't gonna work this time, buddy.

Look how small that fuse is! I'll

get killed.

EVAN

Not necessarily.

EVAN

That should buy you ten minutes at

least.

LENNY

Gee, thanks friend.

TOMMY

Oh, for Christ's sake, just do it,

Lenny.

LENNY

(taking puff)

Thanks.

EVAN

You got balls, man.

SMASH CUT TO:

TOMMY

Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan!

Come on!

EVAN

(frantic)

What happened?? Where are we?!

KAYLEIGH

(crying)

Oh God... what did we do?

EVAN

Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you!

We've gotta get help!

SMASH CUT TO:

ANDREA

What is it? What happened?

TOMMY

(staring menacingly

at the others)

We were just building a fort in the

woods when Lenny freaked out. One

minute he was fine, then he just

froze up. Right guys?

ANDREA

What happened, Evan? The truth.

EVAN

I don't know... I don't remember.

ANDREA

Something must've happened! What set

him off?

EVAN

I... I blacked out.

ANDREA

(building frustration)

Don't try to use your blackouts to

get out of this one!

ANDREA

You're not making this up, are you?

DISSOLVE TO:

DR. REDFIELD

With every breath you exhale, you

can feel all of the tension draining

from your body like water through a

faucet. Nine, ten, and you're

completely asleep. Relaxed.

DR. REDFIELD

Now I want you to go back to the

time you were in the woods with Lenny.

Think of it like a movie. You can

pause, rewind, or slow down any

details you wish. Understand?

EVAN

Yes.

DR. REDFIELD

Where are you now?

EVAN

I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my

hands are over her ears.

DR. REDFIELD

Are you hurting her?

EVAN

No, protecting her.

DR. REDFIELD

Okay. Then go a little forward in

time. What do you see now?

EVAN

I see a car.

DR. REDFIELD

Yes, tell me about the car.

DR. REDFIELD

Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember,

this is only a movie. You're

completely safe.

EVAN

(moaning)

I can't... the car vanishes and all

of a sudden I'm on the ground in the

woods.

DR. REDFIELD

The car doesn't vanish Evan. The

movie in your head has broken, that's

all. But now I've re-spliced it and

I want you to tell me about the car.

EVAN

It's coming... argh! I can't!

DR. REDFIELD

Fight it Evan. Hurry. It's coming!

DR. REDFIELD

Okay, Evan. Listen to my voice! On

the count of ten, you're going to

wake up. Feeling refreshed and

remembering everything we talked

about.

ANDREA

What's happening to him?? Make it

stop!

DR. REDFIELD

One. You're feeling more awake now.

Two, your eyes no longer feel heavy.

DR. REDFIELD

Five. Six. Refreshed and awake! Seven,

eight. Come on, Evan, wake up, dammit!

ANDREA

Evan wake up, oh please wake up!

DR. REDFIELD

Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open

your eyes, dammit!

EVAN

What happened? Did it work?

TOMMY

(to Kayleigh)

Wipe that sad-assed look off your

face before you get us all busted.

You see the way Evan's mom was looking

at you?

KAYLEIGH

I'm sorry.

EVAN

Would someone just tell me already

what the hell happened in the mailbox?

TOMMY

Don't ever bring that shit up again.

Not ever. Not to me, not to Kayleigh,

or even Lenny. The stupid fuck if he

ever learns to talk again. Understand?

TOMMY

Ever.

(re: Kayleigh)

She don't want to talk about it,

anyway. Do you Kayleigh?

EVAN

Are you okay?

TOMMY

There it is. Let's go.

ANCHOR

(on TV)

...was the grizzly aftermath of what

police officials of upstate New York

are calling a horrible act of

vandalism gone awry.

ANCHOR

The powerful explosion is believed

to have been caused by a small

quantity of dynamite.

ANCHOR

Police thus far have no leads as to

the suspects...

TOMMY

Holy shit! Look at that fat fuck!

You'd have to wipe his ass with a

forklift!

TOMMY

Shut up, faggot. No one's talking to

you!

EVAN

I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad

idea.

KAYLEIGH

You really don't remember anything

that happened?

KAYLEIGH

You're so lucky.

EVAN

It's going to be okay. Lenny'll be

fine. You'll see.

KAYLEIGH

Ouch.

EVAN

I'm sorry.

KAYLEIGH

It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called

dad and blamed us for what happened

to Lenny.

EVAN

Damn. Your dad did this?

KAYLEIGH

(looking down)

I deserve a lot worse.

EVAN

What are you talking about? What you

deserve is a better brother and

father. All they do is make you feel

like shit.

EVAN

You really have no clue how beautiful

you are, do you?

TOMMY (O.S.)

What the fuck are you doing??

TEEN PUNK (O.S.)

Buying popcorn, what the fuck are

you doing?

ANDREA

So how was the movie?

KAYLEIGH

Okay.

ANDREA

Any exploding mailboxes?

KAYLEIGH

(faking poorly)

What do you mean?

ANDREA

Goodnight.

ANDREA

We're moving.

FADE TO BLACK:

EVAN

I can't believe Tommy's still pissed

at me. He knows I'm moving away,

right?

KAYLEIGH

He's been acting real strange lately.

He won't even look me in the eyes

anymore.

EVAN

Duck, here they come.

KAYLEIGH

Did your mom say if Lenny was...

okay?

EVAN

He must be. They're letting him go,

right?

EVAN

Welcome home, Lenny!

MRS. KAGAN

I think your little homecoming's in

bad taste.

EVAN

Sorry?

MRS. KAGAN

(acidic)

Lenny's been through a hell of an

ordeal no thanks to you.

EVAN

(quietly)

Welcome home. Thought you might like

some fresh air for a change.

KAYLEIGH

Hi, Lenny.

LENNY

Is Tommy with you guys?

EVAN

It's cool.

KAYLEIGH

(to Lenny)

So what did you do in there?

LENNY

It was awful. You can't sleep 'cause

everyone's screaming all night long.

I never want to go back.

KAYLEIGH

Do you see that?

EVAN

Crockett!!

TOMMY

Look what you made me do!

EVAN

What's wrong with you?!

EVAN

Kayleigh! Wake up!

TOMMY

Why don't you fucking kiss her, Prince

Charming!

SMASH CUT TO:

EVAN

How long was I out?

EVAN

Kayleigh?! Are you okay? Where's

Crockett?

MRS. KAGAN

(ice cold)

Do you know what you are? A monster.

ANDREA

I'm sorry.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

PROFESSOR CARTER

Time! Please place your blue books

on my desk before you leave.

PROFESSOR CARTER

How'd you do, Evan?

EVAN

I'm not sure. I might have gotten

some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov

condition his dogs to lick his nuts?

PROFESSOR CARTER

(laughing)

Typical psych major. A complete wise

ass. And how's your project coming?

Still planning to change the way we

humble scientists view memory

assimilation?

EVAN

(shrugging)

Hey, I got no choice.

EVAN

Whoa. Smells like patchouli and...

ass.

THUMPER

Cricket, meet my well-mannered

roommate, Evan.

CRICKET

Yeah, you're the one who fucked up

the bell-curve on my Anthropology

final. Later, Thumper.

EVAN

Nice to meet you, too.

THUMPER

Here, bro. Found your T-shirt.

EVAN

Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking

me out for my birthday.

THUMPER

I thought you were a December baby.

EVAN

This is bigger. Seven years to the

day. No blackouts.

THUMPER

Let's do this.

KRISTEN

So... which one of you has a pet

worm?

THUMPER

Worms, plural.

KRISTEN

That's so gross.

THUMPER

Talk to him about it, he's got the

fetish.

EVAN

Actually, they're for a psych project.

A study on memory.

HEIDI

(stifling a yawn)

Shit, better explain before all the

excitement gives me a heart attack.

EVAN

It's an experiment with flatworms

and a maze. You take a flatworm and

run it through the maze until he's

memorized it. Then you put a new

flatworm in the maze. He's clueless.

Banging into walls, getting lost,

whatever.

THUMPER

(thoughtfully)

Like Ozzy.

SPENCER

Ten bucks says he eats it off the

floor.

EVAN

You chop up the smart flatworm and

feed it to the dumb one and presto,

the dumb one suddenly knows the maze

inside and out.

EVAN

Just by absorbing the first worm

into its cellular structure, it gets

all of the worm's memories.

THUMPER

(thoughtfully)

That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's

so smart.

HEIDI

So what's the point?

EVAN

(setting up the eight)

Maybe if I can figure out how the

memories of a simple worm function,

it'll help me understand the

complexities of the human brain.

HEIDI

(intrigued)

So are you planning on becoming a

doctor or something?

EVAN

No, I just don't want to lose my

mind.

EVAN

(to Heidi)

I think that's your game.

HEIDI

Smells like sex in here.

EVAN

Thumper had a busy afternoon.

HEIDI

You're kidding. He's so... big.

EVAN

Charisma and eyeliner go a long way,

I guess. Wanna beer?

HEIDI

Most guys tuck their porn under here,

but all you have are... comp books.

EVAN

Yeah. I've been keeping journals

since I was seven.

HEIDI

(respectfully)

Wow... read something.

EVAN

No way, I'd be too embarrassed.

HEIDI

Then keep drinking, worm-boy. You're

too uptight.

EVAN

Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm,"

and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once

you get a nickname like that you

can't shake it. And I don't want

everyone thinking I've got tapeworms

coming out of my ass or something,

okay?

HEIDI

(laughing)

Deal. Now read me something.

EVAN

(re: her beer)

For courage.

EVAN

It's like my mind refused to believe

what it was seeing. Hearing Crockett

make those awful screams... Just

writing about it gives me the shivers.

HEIDI

Come on, go on...

EVAN

It was like Tommy was possessed or

something. There was a hate in his

eyes that I couldn't really call

human.

SMASH CUT TO:

EVAN

What the hell is going on?

LENNY

I can't undo the rope!

TOMMY

Drop it or I'll slit your mother's

throat in her sleep.

EVAN

I got him, Lenny. Help Crockett!

TOMMY

Listen to me good, Evan. There's a

million other sisters in the world.

You didn't have to fuck with mine.

SMASH CUT TO:

EVAN

Oh my God! No! No!

HEIDI

Wake up, idiot. It was just a dream.

EVAN

(freaked out)

It didn't feel like a dream.

HEIDI

Maybe because they never do.

(sarcastic)

So Don Juan, you pass out on all

your dates?

MRS. KAGAN

I've got a surprise for you, Lenny.

You'll never guess who's here.

EVAN

Hey, uh, it's me. Evan.

EVAN

What's that you're working on? A

model?

EVAN

Well, you look busy, so maybe I should

make this quick. I'd totally

understand if you didn't want to get

into this right now, but that day at

the junkyard, could you help me

remember what happened? Any details?

LENNY

I couldn't cut the rope.

EVAN

(containing excitement)

Yeah, good, what else do you remember?

LENNY

Drop it or I'll slit your mother's

throat in her sleep.

EVAN

Jesus Christ. It really happened.

EVAN

What if I can get back all my lost

memories with my journals.

LENNY

Make one peep and I swear it'll be

your last, motherfucker.

EVAN

Well, thanks for seeing me, man. I

shouldn't have waited so long.

THUMPER

You really think he wanted to kill

you?

EVAN

All I know is that I might be able

to unblock some of my repressed

memories.

EVAN

(reading aloud)

The last thing I remember before the

blackout was holding my hands over

Kayleigh's ears...

(his voice slowly

fades)

I think I was more focused on her

hands on mine than the mailbox across

the street...

SMASH CUT TO:

LENNY

Maybe it went out. Should someone

check it?

TOMMY

Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

TOMMY

Make one peep and I swear it'll be

your last, motherfucker.

MRS. HALPERN

How's my sweet girl? Awww, you need

a change, don't you honey?

MRS. HALPERN

You want to open the door, honey?

TOMMY

C'mon! Run!!

TOMMY

Lenny? Come on!

KAYLEIGH

Oh my God oh my God...

SMASH CUT TO:

EVAN

What the hell?

THUMPER

Christ, man. You wanna clean that up

before I lose my appetite here?

EVAN

Yes, hello, uh, Mrs. Kagan, this is

Evan Treborn.

(rolling eyes)

I know. I'm sorry about that. But I

really need to speak with him.

PROFESSOR CARTER

Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan.

Just wanted to know how the flatworms

project was coming.

EVAN

Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of

crazy lately with my mom coming up,

so I haven't...

PROFESSOR CARTER

I know, I know. Who can think of

worms when your libido's in full

swing, right?

PROFESSOR CARTER

Just don't drop the ball, okay?

EVAN

I won't let you down, Professor

Carter.

EVAN

Please, mom. People will talk.

ANDREA

I can't help it. I'm just so proud

of you. You've got the highest grades

in all of your classes.

EVAN

Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?

ANDREA

(smiling)

Please. He got straight A's without

ever touching a book. That was the

one area where his memory never failed

him.

EVAN

Ma? Did he ever say that he figured

out a way to recall a lost memory

years after he blacked it out for

the first time?

ANDREA

Why do you ask?

EVAN

No, it's just weird with him being

such a brain and all, I just wondered

if he was ever able to remember stuff

he'd forgotten.

ANDREA

When he was around your age... almost

exactly your age. He said he figured

out a trick to remember the past.

ANDREA

I couldn't tell if they were real

memories or just phantoms. You know,

he might only have thought he actually

remembered them...

EVAN

Sure...

ANDREA

And then, just before it got so bad

that he had to be committed, he said

that he could...

EVAN

What? What could he do?

ANDREA

Forget it. It's nothing. He was far

too sick by then.

EVAN

(reading aloud)

I never wanted to be in the movie

anyway and it was cold so I wanted

to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller

took his shirt off --

THUMPER

What the fuck are you doing?

EVAN

Shhh! I need quiet for this.

THUMPER

Are you stupid or what?

EVAN

What?

THUMPER

Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a

reason why you've repressed the one

day when some old lecher had you in

your tighty whities, dammit!

THUMPER

Yeah, man. I'd think twice about

this. You could wake up a lot more

fucked up than you are now.

DISSOLVE TO:

BOSS

Can we get through one goddamned day

without you breaking something?

KAYLEIGH

God, Evan! I never thought I'd see

you again. How've you been?

EVAN

Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...

KAYLEIGH

No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a

long time. Fill me in.

EVAN

I'm going to State now. Things are

going okay. I guess. Mom's good...

EVAN

(declining)

Not since we were kids.

KAYLEIGH

I've stopped a hundred times.

EVAN

So how's Tommy?

KAYLEIGH

(takes a long drag)

They kept him in juvy for a few years.

Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.

EVAN

You still live with your dad?

KAYLEIGH

No. I emancipated myself when I was

fifteen.

EVAN

Wow. That must've taken some courage.

KAYLEIGH

Not if you remember my dad.

EVAN

Couldn't you have moved in with your

mom?

KAYLEIGH

(shaking her head)

She had a new family. Not enough

space for me. Said I should have

moved in with her when we were kids.

But... whatever.

EVAN

Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I

came back to town was to talk to

you.

KAYLEIGH

(brightening)

Me? Are you kidding? Why?

EVAN

Remember when I was a kid I had all

these blackouts?

KAYLEIGH

Of course.

EVAN

Well, lately some of the memories

have begun to come back and I'd kinda

like to talk to you about one of

them in particular. It'd be a big

help.

KAYLEIGH

Well, sure. I'll try to remember.

Shoot.

EVAN

When we were kids. Your dad was making

a movie. Robin Hood or something?

KAYLEIGH

(cold)

What do you want to know, Evan?

EVAN

It's just... did he... what happened

in the basement?

KAYLEIGH

It was a long time ago.

EVAN

I know, but...

KAYLEIGH

(cold)

Is that why you came all the way

back? To ask a lot of stupid questions

about Robin Hood?

EVAN

No, but I think something really bad

might've happened to us.

KAYLEIGH

Is there a point to any of this?

EVAN

Whatever happened, it wasn't our

fault. You know we couldn't have

stopped it.

EVAN

Look, Kayleigh. This may sound like

bullshit coming from a guy who hasn't

spoken to you in seven years...

EVAN

But you were seven years old and

there's nothing you could've done to

deserve...

KAYLEIGH

(defeated)

Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting

your breath.

EVAN

You can't hate yourself just because

your dad's a twisted freak.

KAYLEIGH

Who are you trying to convince, Evan?!

You come all the way out here to

stir up my shit just because you had

a bad memory!? You want me to cry on

your shoulder and tell you that

everything's all better now? Well

fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be

all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets

better!

KAYLEIGH

If I was so wonderful, Evan, why

didn't you ever call me? Why'd you

leave me here to rot?!

THUMPER

Some dude left a message for you.

EVAN

You can smell it all the way in the

bathroom.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(male voice)

Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter.

Just wondered why you didn't hand in

your essay this afternoon. I was a

bit concerned. Call me to schedule a

make-up.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(male voice)

What did you say to my sister

motherfucker?! Last night she cried

on the phone for over an hour to me.

(enraged breathing)

She said you came and saw her last

night.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(Tommy; cont'd)

She... she fucking killed herself

tonight. She's dead.

(beat)

And so are you.

THUMPER

Whoa, bad news, bro. I don't think

this is gonna come out.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

EVAN (V.O.)

It's been said that a person's life

is little more than the sum of his

experiences. If that's true, then

I'm not sure I know who I am anymore.

(beat)

I definitely never knew Kayleigh.

SMASH CUT TO:

MR. MILLER

Shut up moron. Now get in your costume

Evan.

MR. MILLER

I've got an idea. Let's go downstairs,

it'll look more like a dungeon down

there.

MR. MILLER

(to Tommy)

What did I say about keeping that

door closed, stupid?

TOMMY

But I wanna see!

MR. MILLER

You're gonna see my fist in about

two seconds unless you do what I

tell you.

MR. MILLER

Now in this part of the story, Robin

Hood just married Maid Marian and

they have to kiss and stuff like

grown-ups do.

MR. MILLER

So take your clothes off Kayleigh.

MR. MILLER

Come on, like when you take a bath.

Don't make a deal out of it. You

too, Evan.

MR. MILLER

Let's go.

EVAN

What time is it?

MR. MILLER

It's time for you to stand where the

hell I told you.

EVAN

Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the

very moment of your reckoning. In

the next thirty seconds you're going

to open one of two doors. The first

door will forever traumatize your

own flesh and blood.

MR. MILLER

(stunned disbelief)

What's happened to -- How are you

doing that?

EVAN

(voice rising)

It'll change your daughter from a

beautiful child into an empty shell

whose only concept of trust was

betrayed by her own sick pedophile

father. Ultimately, it'll lead to

her suicide. Nice work, daddy.

MR. MILLER

(hoarse whisper)

Who -- who are you?

EVAN

Let's just say you're being closely

watched, George. Your other option

is to get your porn off the rack and

treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say

like how a loving father treats his

daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?

MR. MILLER

(choking)

...yes.

EVAN

Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw

up again and I swear I'll flat out

castrate you.

EVAN

One last thing.

KAYLEIGH

Don't you ever touch me again.

MR. MILLER

I -- I won't.

KAYLEIGH

I'm cold. And I'm putting on my

clothes.

EVAN

What you need to do is discipline

your son Tommy, because the kid's

one sadistic pup.

SMASH CUT TO:

BACK TO:

KAYLEIGH (O.S.)

Honey, are you all right?

KAYLEIGH

Oh my God, Evan. You're bleeding!

Look at you!

EVAN

(transfixed by her)

Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...

(looks around)

Incredible.

KAYLEIGH

(purring)

Mmmm... You give good compliment.

Clean up and come back to bed.

EVAN

Where... where are my clothes?

KAYLEIGH

Those are your clothes, silly.

EVAN

This is too amazing! Un-fucking-real!

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

I wish I could get so excited about

a nose bleed.

EVAN

Whoops. Sorry. My bad.

EVAN

Hey, you were with those assholes

who threw popcorn at Thumper.

EVAN

And your name is... Gwen!

GWEN

Seriously, Evan. Lay off the blow.

EVAN

Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me

over this, but do you remember when

your dad first got his video camera?

KAYLEIGH

Well I remember he had one... but

he, like, put it away after the first

day. Why would that freak me out?

EVAN

I dunno.

(goofy smile)

Just being weird.

KAYLEIGH

Such a goofus. See you tonight.

EVAN

(to himself)

Come on, Mom, be there!

ANSWERING MACHINE

(Andrea's voice)

Andrea,

(Evan's voice)

Evan,

(a strange, older

man's voice)

And Chuck,

(all three)

Aren't home right now. You know what

to do.

EVAN

(off-guard)

Hi, Mom and, uh, Chuck. Just calling

to say hi and well, call me.

EVAN

Thumper! What time is it, man?

THUMPER

Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?

EVAN

Huh?

THUMPER

Fuck off, frat boy.

PROFESSOR CARTER

Remember, everyone! Only two weeks

until your science projects are due.

EVAN

(quietly)

I still owe you an essay from last

week. Is there any way I could get

an extension?

PROFESSOR CARTER

And you are...?

EVAN

(disappointed)

Evan Treborn.

PROFESSOR CARTER

The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now

take a seat. The exam's about to

begin.

EVAN

Leave me alone, asshole. I didn't

lay a hand on you, okay?

HUNTER

Evan, you're hysterical. You study

for this?

EVAN

(awkward)

We'll find out soon enough.

HUNTER

(laughing)

Me neither.

EVAN

You're kidding. Are these the

answers?!

HUNTER

Damn, Evan, on the D.L.

EVAN

(holding it lower)

Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do

something really special for Kayleigh

tomorrow. If I said I needed some

help from you and the brothers...

HUNTER

I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to

do it.

KAYLEIGH

Oh my God, that was good. Where'd

you learn all those new tricks?

EVAN

So it didn't feel... weird?

KAYLEIGH

Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms

weird.

EVAN

Yellow.

KAYLEIGH

Fuck 'em.

EVAN

What do you think it is about us

that makes us so perfect? Like,

looking back, whatever gave you the

nerve to sneak out and visit me after

I moved away?

KAYLEIGH

(laughs)

As if my dad could've stopped me

from seeing you. What's he gonna do

to me?

EVAN

You think we'll always be together?

KAYLEIGH

That is the plan, right? Hell or

high water?

EVAN

Just making sure.

DISSOLVE TO:

EVAN

Order, order. So all you rushes know

what you've got to do for me?

THETA CHI PLEDGE

(correcting him)

Pledges, Sir Brother Evan, Sir.

EVAN

Pledges, rushees, same difference.

Now this is a one-time deal. You do

all this for me and I'll never give

you shit again. Promise.

DISSOLVE TO:

KAYLEIGH

I don't understand, where are you

taking me?

EVAN

You'll see.

KAYLEIGH

I don't know what to say. It's

beautiful.

EVAN

Go on. Sit down.

KAYLEIGH

Why are you doing all this for me?

EVAN

Simple math. When I woke up this

morning and saw your smile... I knew

that I wanted to spend the rest of

my life with you.

HUNTER

We been lookin' all over for you,

man.

SENIOR BROTHER

Someone trashed your car.

EVAN

(panicked)

Did you see who did this? You see

anyone?

HUNTER

Probably them Pika fuckers.

EVAN

How could he get away with this?

Right in front of the goddamn frat

house!

SENIOR BROTHER

Frat house? Hey man, would you call

your "country" a "cunt"?

KAYLEIGH

Don't. He's probably watching.

KAYLEIGH

It's my fault. I should have told

you he was released a few weeks ago.

EVAN

Might'a been nice.

(re: pepper spray)

Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe

one of the frat guys has a gun.

KAYLEIGH

Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He

wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying

to scare you away from me.

EVAN

(shaking the cannister)

Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.

KAYLEIGH

(quietly)

It's not his fault, Evan. You knew

how bad he had it when we were kids.

EVAN

Don't give me this Oprah-book club

bad upbringing shit, because you

turned out fine.

KAYLEIGH

(quietly)

My father never laid a hand on me.

It's like the prick saved it all up

for Tommy.

EVAN

Fine, then. We'll let campus security

deal with him.

KAYLEIGH

Are you okay?

EVAN

What do you mean?

KAYLEIGH

It's just... you've been acting kinda

strange, you know?

EVAN

Like how?

KAYLEIGH

I don't know. You seem... different.

You make weird jokes. Your accents

changed. You don't even walk the

same.

EVAN

I walk differently?

KAYLEIGH

I can't put my finger on it, but

everything's a bit off. Even the

dinner tonight. It was beautiful,

but...

EVAN

I know I've been actin strange lately.

It's just that... I don't want

anything to happen to us.

KAYLEIGH

Wait. Something's not right. Isn't

that your jacket?

EVAN

What?

KAYLEIGH

Tommy.

EVAN

Leave us alone you sick fuck!

TOMMY

Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna

lay a hand on my own sister. You've

done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice

friends, nice life, not to mention

you're fucking my sister. Not a bad

piece of ass if I say so myself.

KAYLEIGH

Shut up, Tommy!

TOMMY

Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.

EVAN

What the hell are you doing?

TOMMY

It wasn't enough that the whole world

loves you, but you had to take away

the last person on earth who didn't

think I was a piece of shit.

EVAN

(suppressing panic)

No one thinks you're a piece of shit,

Tommy.

TOMMY

Right, Evan. I believe you just said

"sick fuck."

KAYLEIGH

Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!

EVAN

He's a fucking maniac!

EVAN

He ruined Lenny's life --

EVAN

He killed Crockett --

(kicks him)

Murdered that woman and her baby!

(kicks again)

And he's trying to kill me, Kayleigh!

He's trying to fucking kill me!

DISSOLVE TO:

CARLOS

First time?

CARLOS

Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's

luggage that way.

EVAN

(desperate)

Can you protect me?

CARLOS

Jesus himself couldn't make me take

on the Brotherhood. When they come,

just put your mind in another place,

man. Be somewhere else.

ANDREA

...I spoke to your new lawyer about

the appeal. He's sure he can get you

off on self-defense, so if you're

patient.

EVAN

How long will I be in here?

ANDREA

I don't know. These things take time.

EVAN

How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?

EVAN

What about my journals, Mom? Did you

bring the ones I asked for?

ANDREA

I found these. The others are still

in storage.

EVAN

Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them

all!

ANDREA

Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I

think it's far more important to

focus on your case right now.

EVAN

Sure, Mom. You're right. Just try to

tell Kayleigh I'm sorry.

ANDREA

I'm not gonna lose you, kiddo. Promise

me you'll hang on, Ev.

KARL

Shit on my dick or blood on my knife.

EVAN

Let go! They're mine!

EVAN

Motherfucker!

KARL

We'll be comin' for you tonight,

sister.

KARL

(from Evan's journal)

Today I found my grandfather's death

certificate. He died in a nut house,

just like my father. Mom denies it,

but she thinks I'm gonna end up the

same way...

EVAN

You're religious Carlos, you believe

that bit about "the Lord works in

mysterious ways?"

CARLOS

Straight up.

EVAN

Because I think he sent me to your

cell on purpose. For you to help me.

CARLOS

Shit. I knew you were crazy.

EVAN

I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks

to me in my dreams.

EVAN

Pack of smokes says I can prove it

to you.

EVAN

So when I'm out, I need you to watch

my face and hands closely.

CARLOS

You need to see the prison shrink,

man.

EVAN

Anything today?

CONVICT

Yep. Just not for you.

EVAN

Just tell me if anything weird

happens.

CARLOS

Weirder than this?

EVAN

Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could

happen I guess.

SMASH CUT TO:

MRS. BOSWELL

No monkey business, Evan. Sit still

and finish your drawing.

MRS. BOSWELL

That's great everyone! Just imagine

anything you want to be. There are

no limits.

EVAN

(musically)

Oh, Mrs. Boswelllllllll?

AND WE'RE BACK TO:

CARLOS

Oh sweet Jesus. It's true. It's a

miracle! A miracle!

CARLOS

Your hands. The stigmata!

EVAN

What did you see? What did it look

like?

CARLOS

(laughing)

Signs of the Lord. They just appeared

out of nowhere. I thought you were

loco!

EVAN

So you believe me?

EVAN

I want to make a deal.

EVAN

Look. I'm new to all this but I think

I get how things work. You gotta

join a gang or else end up dead meat.

EVAN

Well it sure ain't gonna fucking be

with no niggers or spics. So how do

we do this? You gotta work your way

up, and I'm the new guy.

(looking ill)

So... should I... I mean, do I suck

your dicks right now?

KARL

Is your blood pure?

EVAN

(angry)

I ain't no fucking kike if that's

what you mean.

RICK

Let's see what you got. And watch

the fucking teeth or you'll be leaving

without 'em.

EVAN

Carlos!

EVAN

We took the woods behind the junkyard

just to make sure we wouldn't bump

into Tommy. We hadn't seen the smoke

yet.

SMASH CUT TO:

EVAN

Rot in hell you fucking animals.

EVAN

Wait. Before we --

EVAN

We need something to cut open the

sack!

EVAN

I want you to take this, Lenny.

Today's your day of atonement. I

know how guilty you feel about that

woman and her baby --

KAYLEIGH

Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.

EVAN

(frantic)

Now's the only time!

(to Lenny)

Today you get a chance to redeem

yourself. Start over with a clean

slate. Tabula rasa --

LENNY

What are you talking about?

KAYLEIGH

You're acting crazy!

EVAN

(desperate; to Lenny)

Please. If you've ever trusted me

before, trust me on this one.

EVAN

Cut the rope.

TOMMY

Listen to me good, Evan...

EVAN

I'll do whatever you want. You don't

want me to ever see Kayleigh again,

fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides,

you kill him now and they'll stick

you in juvy for sure. And I know

you'd never leave your sister alone

with your father.

EVAN

Oh fuck, Lenny, no!

SMASH CUT TO:

EVAN

Christ. Help me.

THUMPER

Someone call 9-1-1!

EVAN

Okay, doc. What's the damage? How

much time have I got?

ANDREA

Cute, Evan.

DR. REDFIELD

It's a little complicated. I haven't

seen results exactly like these

before.

EVAN

Are you sure? Not even with my father?

DR. REDFIELD

Actually, these tests weren't

available twenty years ago.

ANDREA

So what did you find.

DR. REDFIELD

This is where we're finding most of

the hemorrhaging. The outer lining

of the cerebral cortex.

EVAN

(nonplussed)

Lemme guess. Would that be where the

memories are stored?

DR. REDFIELD

I've never seen anything like this.

I've compared these to the ones taken

last year, and there's evidence of

severe hemorrhaging and massive neural

reconstruction.

ANDREA

What does that mean for Evan?

EVAN

(to Andrea)

He's saying it's like forty years

worth of new memories have been jammed

in my brain since last year. Overload

city. 'Sat about the gist of it,

doc?

EVAN

(to Andrea)

Mind if I wait in the car? The

lighting here bugs my eyes.

EVAN

Well, it's nice seeing you again.

But you know, people to see, things

to read...

EVAN

Is there anything you need? Anything

I can get you?

EVAN

What about the models, man? Bet I

can get you a shitload of models up

in here.

EVAN

Okay, Lenny. Just wanted to say "hi".

LENNY

You knew the whole time, didn't you?

(Evan spins around)

When you put the blade in my hand,

you knew something big was going to

happen. Didn't you?!

EVAN

(jaw dropped)

Y... yes. I guess I did.

LENNY

Then you should be where I am. You

should be where I am.

EVAN

(as if reciting a

mantra)

Today I get to meet my father. His

name is Jason and he is crazy...

SMASH CUT TO:

JASON

Are you okay? You looked like you

were somewhere else for a second

there.

EVAN

Look, Jason, I need some fast answers

if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.

JASON

I was praying this curse would have

ended with me.

EVAN

But it didn't. And now I need info

to make things right again and you're

the only one who can give it to me.

JASON

(frustrated)

There is no "right". When you change

who people are, you destroy who they

were.

EVAN

Who's to say you can't make things

better?

JASON

You can't play God, son. It must end

with me. Just by being here, you may

be killing your mother.

EVAN

Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard

when I've made everything perfect

again.

SMASH CUT TO:

WAITRESS

Just get out, didja?

EVAN

Huh?

WAITRESS

(re: his arm)

Nothing. Just that my brother did a

stint in the pen and he used to eat

like that.

EVAN

(defensively)

I come from a big family.

WAITRESS

Meant no offense.

EVAN

None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh

Miller still work here?

WAITRESS

(confused)

Sorry. Never heard of her.

MR. MILLER

Just shut the hell up already! Can't

a man get a little goddman peace in

his own home!

(Evan rings doorbell)

Oh, for Christ's sake, now what?

MR. MILLER

Don't suppose you're here to sell

cookies?

EVAN

Good guess, fuckbag.

(off Miller's startled

face)

Remember me now? We had a great chat

once when I was seven.

EVAN

One question, fuckbag. Where can I

find your daughter?

KAYLEIGH

Oh, I thought you were my eight

o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting

someone.

EVAN

Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?

KAYLEIGH

If I knew you were coming I'd have

cleaned the stains off the sheets.

KAYLEIGH

What do you want?

EVAN

I just needed to see... a friendly

face.

KAYLEIGH

Well, time is money, Evan. So you...

KAYLEIGH

Well, I guess I can spare ten minutes

for an old friend, right?

KAYLEIGH

So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational

humor.

EVAN

I get it. You can drop it now.

KAYLEIGH

(angry again)

Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work

make you uncomfortable, precious?

EVAN

No. Just that you need to hurt me

with it. I've been where you've been.

KAYLEIGH

Ha! Where's that?

EVAN

The bottom. When you're just a piece

of meat waiting for the next attack.

KAYLEIGH

What's happened to you?

EVAN

You wouldn't believe me. I mean,

people always say, "You wouldn't

believe me", but in this case, it's

not even worth trying.

KAYLEIGH

I've seen some sickening shit. I

don't blink twice anymore, especially

in your case.

EVAN

Why's that?

KAYLEIGH

Because you're... different.

EVAN

Different? How?

KAYLEIGH

Let me ask you a question. Just a

little one that's been gnawing at me

for years.

EVAN

Yeah?

KAYLEIGH

On the bridge. How did you know that

Tommy had your dog? That was no

fucking hunch.

EVAN

Do you remember when I was a kid and

I had those blackouts?

DISSOLVE TO LATER:

KAYLEIGH

You're right, Evan, I don't believe

you.

EVAN

I never thought you would. That's

why I've never bothered to tell a

soul until now, and why I never will

again.

KAYLEIGH

I'm the only person you've told?

That's a great line. Does that make

other girls swoon? Do they actually

eat up this bullshit?

EVAN

I couldn't give a shit if you believe

me or not, and frankly I'm too tired

to prove it to you.

KAYLEIGH

Oh? There's proof now?

EVAN

(tired)

Shit. I dunno. How would I know about

the twin moles on your inner thigh?

KAYLEIGH

Anyone with fifty bucks could tell

you that.

EVAN

Then forget that. How about... you

prefer the smell of a skunk to

flowers, you hate cilantro because

for reasons unknown to you, it reminds

you of your step-sister.

EVAN

Oh! And when you orgasm, your toes

go numb. I'm sure your clientele

aren't privy to that one.

EVAN

I just thought you should know.

KAYLEIGH

Know what?

EVAN

That I didn't leave you there to

rot.

KAYLEIGH

There's one major hole in your story.

EVAN

Which is?

KAYLEIGH

There is no fuckin' way on this planet

or any other that I was in some

fuckin' sorority.

KAYLEIGH

Sure you don't want your wallet?

EVAN

Don't think I'll need it where I'm

going.

KAYLEIGH

Off to change everyone's life again,

is that it? Maybe this time you'll

pop up in some mansion while I wind

up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.

EVAN

I'm over it. Whenever I try to help

anyone it all turns to shit.

KAYLEIGH

Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've

already done so much for me. Hell,

why don't you go back in time and

save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then

maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and

ruin my family.

KAYLEIGH

Oh, here's one! Go back when I'm

seven and fuck me in front of Daddy's

handicam, you know, straighten me

out a bit...

EVAN

Get out. Both of you.

THUMPER

Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be

okay with you bein' sick and all.

EVAN

I'm not saying it again.

EVAN

(humble)

Lord give me the strength and guidance

I need to set things right.

SMASH CUT TO:

EVAN

Lady, stay back! Don't go near the

mailbox!

EVAN

I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!

LENNY

There's a bomb in the mailbox. Get

away!

TOMMY

I'll save you lady!

SMASH CUT TO:

EVAN

I thought I told you two to beat it.

LENNY

What? Hey, sorry, man. We wake you

up?

EVAN

No, it's cool.

(re: Lenny's okay)

Really cool.

EVAN

Where are we going?

KAYLEIGH

We have to get you to Sunnyvale.

You're having one of your famous

hemorrhages.

EVAN

Stop! Take me back!

LENNY

Sorry, tough guy, no can do. Your

mother would kill me.

EVAN

Take me back, Lenny!

(teeth clenched)

You owe me that much.

KAYLEIGH

What are you geeks looking at? Must

be nice to be so goddamned perfect,

huh? Fucking losers.

LENNY

'Sup, Sheila! We missed you at the

party! Don't even think I'm giving

you my lab notes either! Think I

like getting up for "eight thirty's"?

LENNY

Hey, there's Tommy.

TOMMY

I did what you said, man! We're

pooling our student funds with Hillel

House and we're going to have an

Awareness Dance.

EVAN

Oh goody, nothing like spinning my

chair around to a techno mix of Hava

Nagila til I puke.

LENNY

Uh, we should be getting to class

now.

EVAN

Forget it. What's the point of Psych

now? Tomorrow I could wake up as

some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.

KAYLEIGH

Let's go for a stroll.

EVAN

So Tommy's really into this Jesus

kick, huh?

KAYLEIGH

You know how spiritual he's gotten

ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and

Katie.

EVAN

He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the

twisted fuck.

KAYLEIGH

Is something the matter?

EVAN

(re: prosthetic arms)

Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed

or something.

EVAN

Kayleigh? Do you ever think about

"us?" I mean, wonder if it could

ever have been different between the

two of us?

KAYLEIGH

Sure, Evan, why not? You were the

first person I really ever cared

about.

EVAN

I was?

KAYLEIGH

That's why when I was little I never

went to live with my mother.

EVAN

I don't get it.

KAYLEIGH

(feeding another bite)

When my folks split, they gave me

and Tommy a choice who we wanted to

live with. I couldn't stand my dad,

but I knew if I moved to my mom's

I'd never see you again.

EVAN

I never knew that. So then you still

sometimes think of us... together?

KAYLEIGH

It's crossed my mind from time to

time.

EVAN

(hopeful)

And...?

KAYLEIGH

Well a lot of things cross my mind.

I've always been a fast thinker, Ev.

I can play out the movie of our entire

lives in under a second. Boom -- we

fall in love -- get married -- two

kids, your keen analytical insight

matched to my generous nature --

kids grow old as do we, relatively

stable relationships, matching burial

plots, the whole bit. It took a lot

longer to spit out than to imagine.

EVAN

Then you think it might have worked

out?

KAYLEIGH

Why not? But that's not how things

wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's

your friend. And there it ends.

EVAN

Would it make any difference if I

told you that no one could possibly

love anyone as much as I love you?

TOMMY

You forgot to put the toaster on the

edge.

EVAN

But you, Kayleigh and Lenny like

toast. And that's really all that

matters now.

TOMMY

I'll get you changed. Visiting hours

are almost up.

EVAN

(looking around)

What, did mom get transferred again?

ANDREA

Looking. Good. Kiddo.

EVAN

(reading)

Lung cancer?

TOMMY

Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts

lately.

EVAN

Right... You started chain smoking

after I blew myself up.

EVAN

There must be a way to fix this.

ANDREA

Fix?

EVAN

I just need the entry about the

blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I

never even got the chance to write

it.

ANDREA

Is Evan... different?

TOMMY

He's just going through some tough

times.

EVAN

Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.

TOMMY

I think I'll go check out the chapel.

ANDREA

You're. Acting. Like your father.

EVAN

Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my

age when he started going crazy

doesn't mean that I'm nuts.

ANDREA

How. Did you. Know that?

EVAN

You told me that on Parents' Weekend.

Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or

you.

ANDREA

Just. Like. Jason.

EVAN

Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out

of here.

ANDREA

Stop him. Stop him. Stop him...

LENNY

Are you sure you even packed it?

EVAN

My mom packed for me. I think she

sent everything I ever owned. So

we'll see.

LENNY

Is this it?

LENNY

What do you need it for? I don't get

you lately.

EVAN

Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you

for one last favor.

LENNY

What?

EVAN

Shhh. I need to concentrate on the

blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.

LENNY

(concerned)

Destroy it?

EVAN

If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom

never woulda started smoking in the

first place. Now shhhh.

SMASH CUT TO:

EVAN

Yes. Now how do I destroy the

blockbuster?

ANDREA

Evan? What are you doing with that

knife?

SMASH CUT TO:

EVAN

Well, that didn't work...

SMASH CUT TO:

MR. MILLER

Now in this part of the story, Robin

Hood just married Maid Marian and

they have to kiss and stuff like

grown-ups do.

EVAN

Wait! I need my belt!

EVAN

(overly childlike)

Loo loo, skip to my loo. Loo loo,

skip to my loo.

EVAN

Loo, loo, skip to my loo.

MR. MILLER

Hey kid, don't bother with the belt.

EVAN

Back off, fuckbag!

EVAN

Amazing. That word never fails to

make an impression with you...

MR. MILLER

Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad

boy or I'll tell mommy you were

naughty.

EVAN

And I'll tell the Child Protective

Services about your kiddie porn

endeavors. One step closer and I'll

shove this up your ass!

MR. MILLER

That's dangerous! You could blow

your hands off!

EVAN

Been there, done that.

MR. MILLER/TOMMY/EVAN

Kayleigh! NOOOOOooooo!

SMASH CUT TO:

EVAN

Oh God, Kayleigh...

SMASH CUT TO:

EVAN

(sobbing uncontrollably)

Kayleigh... no! You can't die again!

I won't let this happen. I won't!

EVAN

Where are they?!

DR. REDFIELD

Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We

don't meet for another hour.

EVAN

Where are my goddamn books?

DR. REDFIELD

Books?

EVAN

My journals! Where are they?

DR. REDFIELD

It kills me to have to go through

this again. There are no journals.

There never were. It's part of this

fantasy world your mind created to

cope with the guilt of killing...

DR. REDFIELD

Think Evan. You've invented a disease

that doesn't exist. Alternate

universes with colleges, prisons,

paraplegia...

EVAN

But I... I need those books.

DR. REDFIELD

You remind me of your father. He

always screamed for a photo album

even though he never had one.

EVAN

Photos?

DR. REDFIELD

Jesus, no.

ANDREA

No dances, just tell me.

DR. REDFIELD

(devastated)

The hemorrhaging... the neural damage

is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised

he still has use of his motor

functions.

EVAN

Hey, Mom, didja remember to bring

those goofy old home movies we used

to make?

EVAN

If anyone finds this, then I guess

my plan didn't work and I'm already

dead.

EVAN

But I -- I can just go back to the

beginning of all this, I might be

able to save her.

DR. REDFIELD

He's not in his room. Search the

grounds.

SMASH CUT TO:

ANDREA

Go on, Evan. Introduce yourself.

KAYLEIGH (V.O.)

When my folks split, they gave me

and Tommy a choice who we wanted to

live with. I couldn't stand my dad,

but I knew if I lived with my mom,

I'd never see you again...

ANDREA (O.S.)

He's not usually this shy.

EVAN

I hate you. If you ever come near me

again, I'll kill you and your whole

family.

KAYLEIGH'S MOTHER

What did you say to her? What

happened?!

EVAN

Goodbye.

SMASH CUT TO:

LENNY (O.S.)

You alright? Should I call the doctor?

EVAN

I'll think I'll be alright this time.

(a new hope)

I really do.

LENNY

You sure about this?

DISSOLVE TO:

EVAN

(into phone)

Yeah, Ma. I'm running a little late

for lunch. One of my patients had a

breakdown. Anyway, order some soup

in the meantime. See ya soon.

THE END
