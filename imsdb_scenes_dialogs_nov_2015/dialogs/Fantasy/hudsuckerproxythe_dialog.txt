Written by

Ethan Coen, Joel Coen, and Sam Raimi

September 1992 Draft

CUT TO:

NARRATOR (V.O.)

The's right... New York.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

It's 1958 -- anyway, for a few mo'

minutes it is. Come midnight it's

gonna be 1959. A whole 'nother

feelin'. The New Year. The future...

NARRATOR (V.O.)

...Yeah ole daddy Earth fixin' to

start one mo' trip 'round the sun,

an' evvybody hopin' this ride 'round

be a little mo' giddy, a little mo'

gay...

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Yep...

NARRATOR (V.O.)

...All over town champagne corks is

a-poppin'.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

...Over in the Waldorf the big shots

is dancin' to the strains of Guy

Lombardo... Down in Times Square the

little folks is a-watchin' and a-

waitin' fo' that big ball to drop...

NARRATOR (V.O.)

...They all tryin' to catch holt a

one moment of time...

NARRATOR (V.O.)

...to be able to say -- 'Right now!

This is it! I got it!' 'Course by

then it'll be past.

(more cheerfully)

But they all happy, evvybody havin'

a good time.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

...Well, almost evvybody. They's a

few lost souls floatin' 'round out

there...

NARRATOR (V.O.)

...This one's Norville Barnes.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

...Let's move in for a closer look.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

...That office he jes stepped out of

is the office of the president of

Hudsucker Industries. It's his

office...

NARRATOR (V.O.)

...How'd he get so high? An' why is

he feelin' so low? Is he really gonna

do it -- is Norville really gonna

jelly up the sidewalk?

NARRATOR (V.O.)

...Well the future, that's something

you can't never tell about...

NARRATOR (V.O.)

...But the past... That's another

story...

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

EXECUTIVE

-- So in the third quarter we saw no

signs of weakening. We're up 18

percent over last year's third quarter

gross and, needless to say, that's a

new record...

EXECUTIVE

...The competition continues to flag

and we continue to take up the slack.

Market share in most divisions is

increasing and we've opened seven

new regional offices...

EXECUTIVE

...Our international division has

also shown vigorous upward movement

in the past six months and we're

looking at some exciting things in

R&D...

EXECUTIVE (V.O.)

Sub-franchising. Don't talk to me

about sub-franchising; we're making

so much money in sub-franchising it

isn't even funny.

THE FUTURE IS NOW.

Start building yours at Hudsucker Industries.

Low pay. Long Hours.

NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY.

Apply Personnel, 285 Madison Avenue.

EXECUTIVE (O.S.)

...Our owned-and-operateds are

performing far above expectations

both here and abroad, and the Federal

Tax Act of 1958 is giving us a swell

writeoff on our plant and heavies...

EXECUTIVE

...The news in the money market isn't

good -- it's excellent...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

EXECUTIVE (O.S.)

...Our nominees and assigns continue

to multiply and expand extending our

influence regionally, nationally and

globally. So, third quarter and year-

to-date, we've set a new record for

sales...

EXECUTIVE (O.S.)

...new record in gross...

EXECUTIVE (O.S.)

...new record in pre-tax earnings...

EXECUTIVE (O.S.)

...new record in after-tax profit...

EXECUTIVE (O.S.)

...and our stock has split twice

this year...

EXECUTIVE (O.S.)

...In short...

EXECUTIVE

...we're loaded.

HUDSUCKER

Ahem...

EXECUTIVE

...Mr. Hudsucker?

THE FUTURE IS NOW.

Start building yours at Hudsucker Industries.

Low pay. Long Hours.

NO EXPERIENCED NECESSARY.

Apply Personnel, 285 Madison Avenue.

HUDSUCKER

Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh...

HUDSUCKER

...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

MUSSBURGER

Pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo.

AN EXECUTIVE

He could've opened the window.

ELDERLY EXECUTIVE

Waring Hudsucker never did anything

the easy way.

ADDISON

My God, why?! Why did he do it?!

Things were going so well!

MUSSBURGER

What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the

man was unhappy.

ADDISON

He didn't look unhappy!

EXECUTIVE

Yeah, well, he didn't look rich.

ELDERY EXECUTIVE

Waring Hudsucker was never an easy

man to figure out.

(reminiscing)

He built this company with his bare

hands. Every step he took was a step

up. Except of course this last one.

MUSSBURGER

Sure, sure, he was a swell guy, but

when the president, chairman of the

board and holder of eighty-seven

percent of the company's stock drops

forty-four floors --

PRECISE EXECUTIVE

Forty-five --

ELDERY EXECUTIVE

Counting the mezzanine --

MUSSBURGER

-- Then the company has a problem.

Stillson, what exactly is the

disposition of Waring's stock?

STILLSON

Well, as you know, Hud left no will

and had no family. The company bylaws

are quite clear in that event. His

entire portfolio will be converted

to common stock and will be sold

over the counter as of the first of

the fiscal year following his demise.

MUSSBURGER

Meaning?

STILLSON

Meaning simply that Waring's stock,

and control of the company, will be

available to the public on January

first.

MUSSBURGER

You mean to tell me that any slob in

a smelly T-shirt will be able to buy

Hudsucker stock?

STILLSON

The company bylaws are quite clear.

ADDISON

My God! You're animals! How can you

discuss his stock when the man has

just leapt forty-five floors --

PRECISE EXECUTIVE

Forty-four --

ELDERLY EXECUTIVE

-- Not counting the mezzanine.

MUSSBURGER

Quit showboating, Addison, the man

is gone. The question now is whether

we're going to let John Q. Public

waltz in and buy 87 percent of our

company.

PIPE-SMOKING EXECUTIVE

What're you suggesting, Sidney?

Certainly we can't afford to buy a

controlling interest.

MUSSBURGER

Not while the stock is this strong.

How long before Hud's paper hits the

market?

STILLSON

January first.

AN EXECUTIVE

Thirty days.

ANOTHER EXECUTIVE

Four weeks.

ADDISON

A month at the most.

MUSSBURGER

One month to make the blue-chip

investment of the century look like

a round-trip ticket on the Titanic.

AN EXECUTIVE

We play up the fact that Hud is dead.

ALL

(in unison)

Long live the Hud!!

ANOTHER EXECUTIVE

We depress the stock --

YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE

-- to the point where we can buy

fifty-percent.

PRECISE EXECUTIVE

Fifty-one.

ELDERLY EXECUTIVE

Not counting the mezzanine.

CAUTIOUS EXECUTIVE

It could work.

OPTIMISTIC EXECUTIVE

It should work.

PRACTICAL EXECUTIVE

It would work.

MUSSBURGER

(at ticker tape machine)

It's working already. Waring Hudsucker

is abstract art on Madison Avenue.

All we need now is a new president

who will inspire real panic in our

stockholders.

ENTHUSIASTIC EXECUTIVE

Yeah, a puppet!

ANOTHER EXECUTIVE

A proxy!

YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE

A pawn!

MUSSBURGER

Sure, sure. Some jerk we can really

push around.

CUT TO:

AGENT

FIFTH SCREAMER

faulty complaint... and they dock

CUT TO:

NORVILLE

ANCIENT SORTER

Terrific.

NORVILLE

Ya know, entry level!

ANCIENT SORTER

Tell me about it.

NORVILLE

I got big ideas, though!

ANCIENT SORTER

I'm sure you do.

NORVILLE

For instance, take a look at this

sweet baby...

NORVILLE

...you look like you can keep a

secret...

NORVILLE

...Something I developed myself.

Yessir, this is my ticket upstairs.

NORVILLE

(explains)

...You know, for kids!

ANCIENT SORTER

Terrific.

NORVILLE

So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom

long.

ANCIENT SORTER

(deadpan)

Nooo, I don't guess you will be.

NORVILLE

How long've you been down here?

ANCIENT SORTER

Forty-eight years...

ANCIENT SORTER

...Next year they move me up to

parcels...

ANCIENT SORTER

...If I'm lucky.

PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)

Attention Hudsucker employees.  We

regretfully announce that at 12:01

this afternoon, Hudsucker time, Waring

Hudsucker, Founder, President, and

Chairman of the Board of Hudsucker

Industries, merged with the infinite.

To mark this occasion of corporate

loss, we ask that all employees

observe a moment of silent

contemplation.

PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)

...Thank you for your kind attention.

This moment has been duly-noted on

your time cards and will be deducted

from your pay. That is all.

PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)

'Blue letter! Blue letter!'

VARIOUS VOICES

Blue letter...! It's a blue letter...!

They're bringing down a blue letter!

MAN

Blue letter!!

ANCIENT SORTER

Jumpin' Jehosephat, a blue letter!

ANCIENT SORTER

It's a blue letter... top, top

level... confidential communication

between the brass... usually bad

news... they hate blue letters

upstairs... Hate 'em!

HUTCHINSON

You!

HUTCHINSON

...Yeah, you! Barnes!

HUTCHINSON

...You don't look busy! Think you

can handle a blue letter?

(laughs sadistically)

...This letter was sent down this

morning by the big guy himself! 'At's

right, Waring Hudsucker! It's

addressed to Sid Mussburger!

Hudsucker's right-hand man! It's a

blue letter! That means you put it

right in Mussburger's hand. No

secretaries! No receptionists! No

colleagues! No excuses!

HUTCHINSON

Mussburger!!

CUT TO:

BUZZ

Hiya, buddy! The name is Buzz, I got

the fuzz...

BUZZ

...I make the elevator do what she

duzz!

BUZZ

...Hang it up to dry.

BUZZ

...What's your pleasure, buddy?

NORVILLE

(regaining his balance)

Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --

BUZZ

Forty-four, the top brass floor say,

buddy! What takes fifty years to get

up to the top floor and thirty seconds

to get down?

NORVILLE

I --

BUZZ

Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Say, buddy!

BUZZ

Mr. Kline, up to nine. Mrs. Dell,

personnel. Mr. Levin, thirty-seven.

MR. LEVIN

Thirty-six.

BUZZ

Walk down. Ladies and gentlemen,

step to the rear; here comes

gargantuan Mr. Grier.

FAT MAN

Buzz.

BUZZ

Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid

businessman on the street?

NORVILLE

Well, I --

BUZZ

Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk

fully dressed? When it's 'wearing'

Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!

BUZZ

...Ya get it, buddy, it's a pun,

it's a knee-slapper, it's a play on

Jesus, Joseph and Mary, is that a

blue letter?!

BUZZ

...Cripes a'mighty, whyn't ya tell a

guy?! Hold on, folks, we're express

to the top floor!

CUT TO:

BUZZ

(hissing)

Good luck, buddy!

BUZZ

-- You'll need it!

NORVILLE

...Mr. Mussburger's office?

RECEPTIONIST

Do you have an appointment?

NORVILLE

Uhh, no, I --

RECEPTIONIST

Shall we look in the book, hmmmmmmmmm?

NORVILLE

No, ma'am, ya see, I wouldn't be in

the --

RECEPTIONIST

We don't seem to be in the boooook.

NORVILLE

No, ma'am, ya see I don't have an --

RECEPTIONIST

If we had an appointment we'd be in

the booook.

NORVILLE

I know but ya see I have this --

here it is, this letter --

MUSSBURGER

-- Sure sure, Parkinson's stupid but

he's ambitious, too hard to control...

MUSSBURGER

...No! Not McClanahan; sure he bungled

the Teleyard merger, but that means

he's got something to prove...

MUSSBURGER

...Who let you in?

NORVILLE

I --

MUSSBURGER

Atwater? Tremendous. Except I fired

him last week --

VOICE (V.O.)

Mr. Bumstead is waiting downstairs.

MUSSBURGER

Tell him I'll be right there...

(looks at Norville)

Well, what is it?

NORVILLE

I --

MUSSBURGER

You, maybe you're the company's

biggest moron. We can't use Morris,

he's been with us too long, he's a

nice guy, too many friends. Matter

of fact, why don't you fire him. No --

scratch that; I'll fire him.

(looks up at Norville)

...Make it fast, make it fast.

NORVILLE

You --

VOICE (V.O.)

Mr. Bumstead is getting very --

MUSSBURGER

I'll be right there. Give him a

magazine.

(to Norville)

...What're you, a mute?

MUSSBURGER

...Yeah, how's the stock doing?

...Bad, huh? Well it's not bad enough.

(into the first phone)

...Look, chump, either you find me a

grade A ding-dong or you can tender

your key to the executive washroom.

(into the second phone)

And that goes double for you.

(into the first phone)

Ear-clay?

(into both phones)

Ood-gay!

(slams down both

phones, looks at

Norville)

This better be good. I'm in a bad

mood.

NORVILLE

Well, sir. I've got something for

you from the mailroom, but first if

I could just take a minute or so

from your very busy time...

NORVILLE

...to show you a, uh...

NORVILLE

...a little something I've been

working on for the last two or three

years...

NORVILLE

...You know, for kids! Which is

perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I

claim to be any great genius; like

they say, inspiration is 99 percent

perspiration, and in my case I'd say

it's at least twice that, but I gotta

tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this

sweet baby --

MUSSBURGER

Wait a minute!

MUSSBURGER

Hmmm...

MUSSBURGER

Umm-hmm...

MUSSBURGER

Siddown.

MUSSBURGER

...Go ahead. Try it on.

MUSSBURGER

...Put your feet up.

MUSSBURGER

...Go ahead.

MUSSBURGER

Hmmmm... Let's get to know one

another, shall we?

MUSSBURGER

...Let's chat!

(beams)

...Man to man!

MUSSBURGER

...You weren't blessed with much...

MUSSBURGER

...education, were you?

NORVILLE

Well, I'm a college graduate --

MUSSBURGER

All right, but you didn't excel in

your studies...?

NORVILLE

Well, I made the dean's list.

MUSSBURGER

(worried)

Hmmm.

NORVILLE

At the Muncie College of Business

Administration.

MUSSBURGER

(relieved)

Sure, sure. And did your classmates

there call you 'jerk' or...

(searches again)

...'schmoe'?

MUSSBURGER

...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'?

'Lamebrain'?

NORVILLE

No, sir.

MUSSBURGER

Not even behind your back?

NORVILLE

Sir! They voted me most likely to

succeed!

MUSSBURGER

(curtly)

You're fired.

NORVILLE

But, sir! --

MUSSBURGER

Get your feet off that desk.

NORVILLE

But --

MUSSBURGER

Get out of my sight.

MUSSBURGER

My God! The Bumstead contracts!!

NORVILLE

Oh my God, sir!

MUSSBURGER

You nitwit! I worked for three years

on this deal!

NORVILLE

Oh my God, sir!

MUSSBURGER

I'll take care of it. Just get out!

MUSSBURGER

Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed

the most sensitive deal of my career!

NORVILLE

Oh my God, sir!

MUSSBURGER

Now out of here! Out!

MUSSBURGER

Not that way! Through the door!

NORVILLE

But, sir!

MUSSBURGER

Right away, buster! Out of my office!

MUSSBURGER

Up on your feet! We don't crawl at

Hudsucker Industries!

NORVILLE

Sir, my leg is on fire!

MUSSBURGER

Get out of this office, you dithering

nincompoop!

NORVILLE

Oh my God, sir!

MUSSBURGER

My God! The Bumstead contracts!

NORVILLE

Oh my God, sir!

MUSSBURGER

Eeeeeeaaaahhhhh!

CUT TO:

BUMSTEAD

No magazine. No coffee. Mussburger!

I wanna see Mussburger! Or did he

jump out a window too?!

CUT TO:

NORVILLE

Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger! I gotcha.

I gotcha by your pants!

LUIGI

Meester Moosaburger, I give-a you

pants a nice-a dooble stitch. Make

'em strong, and they look-a real

sharp.

MUSSBURGER

(barking)

No! Single stitch is fine.

LUIGI

(begging)

But please-a, Meester Moosaburger,

the dooble stitch she last-a forever --

MUSSBURGER

Why on earth would I need a double

stitch? To pad your bill? Single

stitch is fine!

CUT BACK TO:

MUSSBURGER

Damn!

QUICK WIPE TO:

LUIGI

(musing to himself)

What the heck. Meester Moosaburger

such a nice-a guy, I give him dooble

steech-a anyway. Assa some-a strong-

a steech-a, you bet!

MUSSBURGER

Hmmm...

FADE OUT:

EDITOR

'The Einstein of Enterprise.' 'The

Edison of Industry.' 'The Billion-

Dollar Cranium'... 'Idea Man'!

(exploding)

And not one of you mugs has given me

a story on him!!

EDITOR

Facts, figures, charts! They never

sold a newspaper! I read this

morning's edition of the Argus and

let me tell you something: I'd wrap

a fish in it!  I'd use it as kindling!

Hell, I'd even train my poodle with

it if he wasn't a French poodle and

more partial to the pages of Paree

Soir! But I sure wouldn't shell out

a hard-earned nickel to read the

dadblamed thing!

REPORTER

Come on, chief, give us a break.

EDITOR

Suuuure, Tibbs, take a break! Go to

Florida! Lie in the sun! Wait for a

coconut to drop, file a story on it --

it'll be more of a grabber than your

piece on the commie grain surplus!

The human angle! That's what sells

papers! We need a front page with

heart and the whole idea of the 'Idea

Man' idea can put it there!

REPORTER #2

Chief, if we had more access --

EDITOR

Yeah, and if a frog had wings he

wouldn't bump his ass a-hoppin'! I

don't want excuses, I want results!

EDITOR

I wanna know what makes the Idea Man

tick! Where is he from? Where is he

going? I wanna know everything about

this guy! Has he got a girl? Has he

got parents?

REPORTER #3

Everybody has parents.

EDITOR

All right, how many? How 'bout it,

Parkinson, you've been awful quiet

over there.

PARKINSON

Uhhh...

REPORTER NEXT TO HIM

Still waters run deep, chief.

EDITOR

The only thing that runs deep with

Parkinson is the holes in his ears.

Yes, the Idea Man! What're his hopes

and dreams, his desires and

aspirations? Does he think all the

time or does he set aside a certain

portion of the day? How tall is he

and what's his shoe size? Where does

he sleep and what does he eat for

breakfast? Does he put jam on his

toast or doesn't he put jam on his

toast, and if not why not and since

when?

EDITOR

...Well?!!

EDITOR

...Ahh, you're useless. Yes, Idea

Man! Creator! Innovator! Cerebrator!

Tycoon!--

WOMAN (O.S.)

Fake.

EDITOR

Huhh!!

AMY

I tell ya the guy's a phony.

EDITOR

Phony, huh?

AMY

As a three-dollar bill.

EDITOR

Sez who?

AMY

Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an

Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says

he is? What're his ideas? Why won't

they let anyone interview him?...

REPORTER

Five bucks says she mentions her

Pulitzer.

OTHER REPORTER

Again? You're on.

AMY

(as she picks up the

morning paper)

...And just take a look at the mug

on this guy -- the jutting eyebrows,

the simian forehead, the idiotic

grin. Why he has a face only a mother

could love --

AMY

...On payday! The only story here is

how this guy made a monkey out of

you, Al.

EDITOR

Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still

editor of this rag. Amy, I thought

you were doing that piece on the

F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will

He Marry?

AMY

I filed it yesterday.

EDITOR

Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero

or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums

get up off your brains and get me

that Idea Man story!

REPORTERS

All right, chief... We'll do our

best, chief... I'll give it a shot,

chief...

AMY

(at the door)

Al, he's the bunk.

AMY

I'll stake my Pulitzer on it!

CUT TO:

BUZZ

Say, buddy! Where'd ya get the new

duds?

BUZZ

...and say, buddy! How'd old

bucketbutt like his blue letter?

Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Did he bust a gut?

Did he die? Did he -- Well, hello,

Mr. Mussburger, sir...

BUZZ

...How're you this fine morning,

sir?

NORVILLE

That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid.

I never did give you that--

MUSSBURGER

(to Buzz)

Lobby. We haven't got all day.

BUZZ

Right away, Mr. Mussburger sir.

MUSSBURGER

Well I'm starved. I understand it'll

be quite an affair this afternoon,

and the executive roast tom turkey

at the Bohemian Grove redefines the

word superb.

BUZZ

My pleasure, sir.

NORVILLE

Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry

too --

MUSSBURGER

Sure, sure...

BUZZ

It's been a pleasure serving you,

Mr. Mussburger.

BUZZ

...and it's been a pleasure serving

you too, uh... buddy.

NORVILLE

Say, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid! Shouldn't

we be a little bit concerned with

the downward spiral of our stock

these last few days? I mean, you're

the expert, but at the Muncie College

of Business Administration they told

us --

MUSSBURGER

Relax, Norville. It's only natural

in a period of transition for the

more nervous element to run for cover.

NORVILLE

Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the

expert, but --

NORVILLE

...You don't happen to remember the

plan I outlined to you the day I set

fire to your off -- uh, the day I

was promoted?

MUSSBURGER

I do remember and I was impressed.

Anyway, that's all forgotten now.

Driver!

NORVILLE

Thank you, Sid, but the reason I

mention it is, it would require such

a small capital investment -- again,

you're the expert here --

MUSSBURGER

Damnit, where's my car!

NORVILLE

-- But there's such an enormous

potential profit-wise given the

demographics -- baby boom --

discretionary income in the burgeoning

middle class --

MUSSBURGER

Finally.

NORVILLE

-- So if you think it's appropriate,

I'd like to bounce the idea off a

few people at lunch --

MUSSBURGER

Sure, sure, tell whoever you want...

MUSSBURGER

...And I'd like to hear more about

it at some point, too.

NORVILLE

But, Sid, I thought you and I were...

DOORMAN

Say, bud, could you keep the sidewalk

clear here?

NORVILLE

But I'm the president of this --

aww, forget it.

CUT TO:

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

I got gas, Bennie.

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

Yeah, tell me about it.

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

Twenty bucks says not here she don't

find one.

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

She's looking for her mark.

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

She finds him.

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

She sits down.

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

...and awduhs a light lunch.

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

She looks in her purse...

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

...No money.

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

The mark notices.

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

...He's not noticing, Benny.

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

Maybe he's wise.

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

He don't look wise.

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

Plan two: Here come the waterworks.

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

Yellowstone.

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

Old Faithful.

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

Hello, Niagara.

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

He notices.

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

He's concerned.

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

She explains her perdicament, and...

VETERAN #1 & #2 (O.S.)

(in unison)

...entuh the light lunch.

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

She's got other problems, of course...

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

...Her mother needs an operation...

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

...adenoids.

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

No, Bennie: Lumbago.

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

(alarmed)

She's losing him, Bennie.

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

Maybe he's wise.

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

He don't look wise.

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

How does she pull this out?

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

(disbelieving)

She isn't!

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

(thrilled)

She is!

VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

She's good, Bennie.

VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

She's damn good, Lou.

WAITRESS

(bored, nasal voice)

Can I get you boys anything else?

VETERAN #1

Bromo.

VETERAN #2

...Bromo.

AMY

I'm sorry we had to take the stairs.

It was just that horrible little

elevator boy...

NORVILLE

Not at all. You're light as a feather.

AMY

(pointing languorously)

The couch, please.

NORVILLE

Just a minute.

AMY

I don't know what came over me. I

suppose it was the shock of eating

after so long without; the enzymes

kicking in after so long, or whatever.

But then you couldn't possibly know

what it is to be tired and hungry...

NORVILLE

Hungry, anyway.

AMY

I don't want to bore you with all

the sordid details of my life; it's

not a happy story...

AMY

...Suffice it to say that I'm jobless --

though not for want of trying, that

I'm friendless, with no one to --

thank you -- take care of me; and

that had you not come along at just

exactly the moment that you did --

AMY

Norville, I didn't know you were

president here!

NORVILLE

Oh, it's nothing really. Just

determination and hard work...

NORVILLE

...Of course, when I started in the

mailroom last Tuesday I thought it

might take more time --

BUZZ

Say, buddy, here's the whiskey you

asked f --

NORVILLE

(flustered)

Thank you, Buzz, just leave it on

the desk.

BUZZ

Happy days, buddy...

BUZZ

...and I'll tell your secretary you're

not to be disturbed. Yowzuh!!

AMY

(shuddering)

What a horrible little person.

NORVILLE

Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --

AMY

At any rate I arrived in town not

ten days ago, full of dreams and

aspirations, anxious to make my way

in the world --

AMY

A little naive perhaps but -- thank

you -- armed with determination, a

solid work ethic, and an indomitable

belief in the future --

NORVILLE

I myself --

AMY

Only to have that belief, that

unsullied optimism, dashed against

the marble and mortar of the modern

work place --

NORVILLE

Cigarette?

AMY

No thank you. Seek and ye shall find,

work and ye shall prosper -- these

were the watch words of my education,

the ethics of my tender years --

AMY

-- these were the values that were

instilled in me while I was growing

up in a little town you've probably

never heard of --

NORVILLE

Mind if I join you?

AMY

Be my guest. A little town you've

probably --

NORVILLE

He waves his arms and talks with a

thick rasp as he staggers to his

feet.

NORVILLE

Excuse me -- I -- executive

washroom...

AMY

Are you all right?...

AMY

...Is it your lunch? The chicken a

la king?

NORVILLE (O.S.)

No, I --

AMY

Is the a la king repeating on you?

NORVILLE (O.S.)

...I'm fine, I... You were saying?

AMY

Values... watchwords... uh, tender

years...

(aloud)

-- A little town you've probably

never heard of...

AMY

...Muncie, Indiana.

NORVILLE

You're from Muncie?!

AMY

Why yes, do you know it?

NORVILLE

'Fight on fight on dear old Muncie

Fight on -- Hoist the gold and blue

You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin'

Once 'The Munce' is done with you!'

NORVILLE

...Goooooooo Eagles!

NORVILLE

...A Muncie girl! Talk about the

cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy.

I'm gonna cancel the rest of my

appointments this afternoon and get

you a job here at the Hud.

AMY

Oh, no, really, I --

NORVILLE

Don't bother to thank me, it's the

easiest thing in the world. Matter

of fact, I know where a vacancy just

came up.

NORVILLE

...Mail room.

NORVILLE

...This'll only take a moment.

INTERCOM (V.O.)

Yeah?

NORVILLE

Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville

Barnes --

INTERCOM (V.O.)

Barnes! Where the hell have you been!

And where's my voucher?!

NORVILLE

...Well, I'm not sure where I --

INTERCOM (V.O.)

I need that voucher! I told you a

week ago it was important!

NORVILLE

But look, I'm president of the company

now and I --

INTERCOM (V.O.)

I don't care if you're president of

the company! I need that voucher!

Now!

NORVILLE

Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do

you take shorthand? Are you familiar

with the mimeograph machine?

AMY

Of course -- I went to the Muncie,

uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!

NORVILLE

-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!

AMY

Well, I just don't know how to thank

you, Mr. Barnes --

NORVILLE

Please! Norville!

NORVILLE

...It's my pleasure!

NORVILLE

...Gooooooo Eagles!

AMY

Gooooooooo Eagles!

SMITTY

(wheezing)

...Once 'The Munce'... Holy...

AMY

And is this guy from chumpsville?!

I pulled the old mother routine --

SMITTY

Adenoids?

AMY

Lumbago.

SMITTY

That gag's got whiskers on it!

AMY

I'm telling you, Smitty, the board

of Hudsucker is up to something --

SMITTY

(into phone)

Yeah.

ANCIENT PUZZLER

Say, Amy, what's a six-letter word

for an affliction of the hypothalmus?

AMY

-- And it's a cinch -- Goiter --

it's a cinch this guy isn't in on

it. How much time to make the Late

Final?

SMITTY

Chief.

AMY

Hiya, Chief, just the person I wanted

to apologize to...

SMITTY

About seven minutes.

AMY

(still typing)

Yeah, I was all wet about your idea

man... Well, thanks for being so

generous... It is human, and you are

divine... No, he's no faker. He's

the 100% real McCoy beware-of-

imitations genuine article: the guy

is a real moron --

AMY

-- as in a five-letter word for

imbecile --

AMY

-- as pure a specimen as I've ever

run across... Am I sure he's a nitwit?

Heck, if working at the Argus doesn't

make me an expert then my name isn't

Amy Archer and I've never won the

Pulitzer Prize...

AMY

...In 1957... My series on the

reunited triplets -- come on down

here, hammerhead, and I'll show it

to ya...

ANCIENT PUZZLER

Amy, what's a three-letter word for

a flightless bird?

AMY

Not now, Morris, I'm busy -- That's

right, I said hammerhead, as in a

ten-letter word for a smug bullying

self-important newspaperman --

AMY

-- Gnu --

AMY

-- who couldn't find --

AMY

-- That's G-N-U --

AMY

-- couldn't find the Empire State

Building with a compass, a road map

and a native guide.

AMY

-- or emu.

AMY

...And that's just the potatoes,

Smitty, here comes the gravy: The

chump really likes me. A Muncie girl!

SMITTY

Better off falling for a rattlesnake.

AMY

I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the

patsy and I'm gonna find out what

for. There's a real story, Smitty,

some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal,

a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!

SMITTY

He didn't offer you money.

AMY

A sawbuck!

SMITTY

Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!

AMY

On Norville Barnes!

AMY

...Copy!

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

DISSOLVING WITH:

NORVILLE

Miss Smith, can you come in please

to take a letter...

NORVILLE

...of all the cockamamie...

NORVILLE

...Did you happen to see the front

page of today's Manhattan Argus?

AMY

Well, I... didn't bother to read the

article. I didn't think the picture

did you justice.

NORVILLE

The picture was fine! It's what that

knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath!

Of all the irresponsible... Amy,

take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I

call you 'Miss' because you seem to

have 'missed' the boat completely on

this one! How on earth would you

know whether I'm an imbecile when

you don't even have the guts to come

in here and interview me man to man!

No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No,

make it 'common decency.' These wild

speculations about my intelligence --

AMY

-- or lack thereof?

NORVILLE

(nodding)

-- these preposterous inventions,

would be better suited to the pages

of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the

editors of the Manhattan Argus see

fit to publish the rantings of a

disordered mind, perhaps they will

see fit to publish this letter! But

I doubt it. I most seriously doubt

it. As I doubt also that you could

find a home at Amazing Tales, a

periodical which I have enjoyed for

many years. Yours sincerely, et

cetera.

AMY

Is that all, Mr. Barnes?

NORVILLE

...Well, you know me, Amy, at least

better than that that dame does. Do

you think I'm an imbecile?

AMY

I'm sure I --

NORVILLE

Go on, tell the truth; I trust you

and I put a lot of stock in your

opinion.

AMY

Well, I --

NORVILLE

Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a

fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile

come up with this?

NORVILLE

...I designed it myself and this is

just the sweet baby that can put

Hudsucker right back on top.

NORVILLE

...You know! For kids!

AMY

...Why don't I just type this up...

NORVILLE

Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be

necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's

just doing her job, I guess.

AMY

Well, I don't know; maybe she does

deserve it. Maybe she should've come

in to face you man to man.

NORVILLE

Well, she probably had a deadline...

AMY

Sure, but -- she could still have

gotten your side for the record!

NORVILLE

Well, it's done now -- what's the

use of grousing about it. Forget the

letter, Amy, I just had to blow off

some steam...

NORVILLE

...She's probably just a little

confused.

AMY

Confused?

NORVILLE

Yeah, you know, probably one of these

fast-talking career gals, thinks

she's one of the boys. Probably is

one of the boys, if you know what I

mean.

AMY

(through clenched

teeth)

I'm quite sure I don't know what you

mean.

NORVILLE

Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of

these complexes they have nowadays.

Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it?

She's probably very unattractive and

bitter about it.

AMY

Oh, is that it!

NORVILLE

Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in

men's clothing, swaps drinks with

the guys at the local watering hole,

and hobnobs with some smooth talking

heel in the newsroom named Biff or

Smoocher or...

AMY

Smitty.

NORVILLE

Exactly. And I bet she's ugly.

Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't

they print her picture next to her

byline?

AMY

Maybe she puts her work ahead of her

personal appearance.

NORVILLE

I bet that's exactly what she tells

herself! But you and I both know

she's just a dried-up bitter old

maid. Say, how about you and I grab

a little dinner and a show after

work? I was thinking maybe The King

and I --

NORVILLE

...How about Oklahoma?

AMY

Norville Barnes, you don't know a

thing about that woman! You don't

know who she really is! And only a

numbskull thinks he knows things

about things he knows nothing about!

NORVILLE

Say, what gives?

VOICE (O.S.)

Watchoo doin' down they, Miss Archuh?

AMY

Huh?!

AMY

Who are you? How did you know who I

am?

MOSES (BLACK MAN)

Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about

ever'thing, leastways if it concerns

Hudsuckuh.

AMY

But -- who are you -- what d'you do

here?

MOSES

Ah keeps the ol' circle turning --

this ol' clock needs plenty o' care.

Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money --

it drives that ol' global economy

and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin'

on 'roun'. Ya see, without that

capital fo'mation --

AMY

Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone

about me, will you?

MOSES

I don't tell no one nothin' lessen

they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses'

way.

AMY

So if you know everything about

Hudsucker, tell me why the Board

decided to make Norville Barnes

president.

MOSES

Well, that even surprised ole Moses

at fust. I didn't think the Board

was that smart.

AMY

That smart?!

MOSES

But then I figured it out: they did

it 'cause they figured young Norville

for an imbecile. Like some othuh

people ah know.

AMY

Why on earth would they want a nitwit

to be president?

MOSES

'Cause they's little pigglies!

They's tryin' to inspire panic, make

that stock git cheap so's they can

snitch it all up fo' themselves! But

Norville, he's got some tricks up

his sleeve, he does...

MOSES

...you know, fo' kids? Yeah, he's a

smart one, that Norville, heh-heh,

he's a caution. Wal, some folks is

square, an' some is hip --

MOSES

...But I guess you don't really know

him any better than that board does,

do ya, Miss Archuh?

AMY

Well, maybe I --

MOSES

An' only some kind a knucklehead

thinks she knows things 'bout things

she, uh -- when she don't, uh --

How'd that go?

AMY

(bristling)

It's hardly the same --

MOSES

Why you don't even know y'own self --

you ain't exactly the genuine article

are you, Miss Archuh?

AMY

Well, in connection with my job,

sometimes I have to go undercover as

it were --

MOSES

I don't mean that! Why you pretendin'

to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't

never gonna make you happy! Never

made Warin' happy.

AMY

(uncomfortably)

I'm happy enough.

MOSES

(chuckles)

Okay, Miss Archuh.

(turns and walks away)

...I got gears to see to.

AMY

(calls after him)

I'm plenty happy!

AMY (O.S.)

...Hello?

MOSES

(muttering to himself)

Them po' young folks. Looks like

Norville's in fo' the same kind o'

heartache ol' Warin' had. But then,

she never axed me 'bout dat...

FADE OUT:

CHIEF

I can't print this!

AMY

Why not, it's all true! The board is

using this poor guy! They're

depressing the stock so they can buy

it cheap!

CHIEF

It's pure speculation! Why, they'd

have my butt in a satchel!

SMITTY

(chuckling)

Ol' satchel-butt...

AMY

I know they're gonna buy that stock --

CHIEF

You don't know anything! Fact is

they haven't bought it! The stock is

cheap, Archer! What're they waiting

for?

AMY

I don't know...

SMITTY

Amy's hunches are usually pretty

good, Chief.

CHIEF

You don't accuse someone of stock

manipulation on a hunch, Ignatz!

The readers of the Manhattan Argus

aren't interested in sensationalism,

gossip and unsupported speculation.

Facts, figures -- those are the tools

of the newspaper trade! Why it's

almost as if you're trying to take

the heat off this Barnes numbskull --

like you've gone all soft on him!

SMITTY

Come on, Chief, that's a low blow.

Archer's not gonna go goey for a

corn-fed idiot.

CHIEF

All right, I was out of line. But

you're out of line with this stock

swindle story. Gimme some more of

that Moron-from-Sheboygan stuff --

AMY

Muncie.

CHIEF

Whatever. That's what sells

newspapers.

AMY

I've got an even hotter story --

The Sap from the City Desk.

CHIEF

Watch it, Archer --

AMY

It's about a dimwitted editor who --

SMITTY

Easy, Amy...

SMITTY

...Let's grab a highball and calm

down.

AMY

Back off -- smoocher!

SMITTY

(angry)

Say, what gives?

MRS. MUSSBURGER

-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons

and the garden was in positive ruins!

NORVILLE

That must have been quite a

disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.

MRS. MUSSBURGER

Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I

was in bed for a week! Positively

sick with fury! I called in the

gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez,

either those azaleas come up next

spring or you are terminee!

MRS. MUSSBURGER

I'm brushing up on my French with

the most charming man, Pierre of

Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?

NORVILLE

I haven't had --

MRS. MUSSBURGER

Sidney and I are planning a trip to

Paris and points continental --

Aren't we, dear?

MUSSBURGER

Sure, sure. I'm going to borrow

Norville for a while, if you don't

mind, dear.

MRS. MUSSBURGER

Well, frankly, I...

NORVILLE

You have a charming wife, Mr.

Muss -- uh, Sid.

MUSSBURGER

So they tell me. Norville, let me

shepherd you through some of the

introductions here. Try not to talk

too much; some of our biggest

stockholders are, uh -- scratch that:

Say whatever you want.

MUSSBURGER

Norville Barnes, allow me to introduce

Mr. Zebulon Cardozo, one of Hudsucker

Industries largest and most loyal

stockholders.

CARDOZO (BUSINESSMAN)

Dammit boy, what's this I hear about

you bein' an embecile? What the hell

is ailin' ya?! A week ago my stock

was worth twice what it is now! I'm

considering dumping the whole shootin'

match, unless I see some vast

improvement! Dammit, boy, It's a

range war! Either you pull our wagons

into a circle or I'm pullin' out of

the wagon train!

NORVILLE

No need for concern, sir; it's only

natural in a period of transition

for the more timid element to run

for cover --

CARDOZO

So I'm yella, am I?!!

CARDOZO

...We'll see who's yella!!

MRS. CARDOZO

Zebulon, you mind now and quit bein'

sech an ole grizzly.

CARDOZO

Aww, I wasn't gonna hurt the boy,

Lorelei...

NORVILLE

I'm sorry, Sid, I thought maybe if I

showed him the long view we might --

MUSSBURGER

Norville, this is Thorstensen

Finlandsen, who heads a radical

splinter group of disgruntled

investors.

NORVILLE

Hello, Mr. Finlandsen, so sorry to

meet you -- uh, happy to walk into y --

uh, pleased to make your --

NORVILLE

Thank you, sir...

NORVILLE

...I understand your concern about

the down-ward, you know, but I think

you'll find under our strong new

leadership...

NORVILLE (O.S.)

We anticipate, in short order, an

upward...

MRS. FINDLANDSEN

Ahhh!

EMCEE

Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished

members of the Hudsucker board. I

give you the king of swing, the rajah

of romance, the incredible, the

unforgettable Mister Vic... Tenetta!

CUT TO:

EXECUTIVE #1

How's it going, Mr. Mussburger?

MUSSBURGER

Bad.

EXECUTIVE #2

Good.

MUSSBURGER

But not bad enough.

EXECUTIVE #3

Too bad.

MUSSBURGER

It could be better, it could be worse.

ALL THREE EXECUTIVES

Hmmmmmm.

MUSSBURGER

The stock's got to drop another five

points if we expect to get controlling

interest. Norville tells me he's got

some hot idea. Can't be good.

EXECUTIVE #1

Then it can't be bad!

EXECUTIVE #2

Couldn't be better if it couldn't be

worse.

ALL

Hmmmmmm.

AMY

...Norville?

AMY

...What happened?

NORVILLE

Oh. Nothing, really, just... the

more timid investors are no longer

running for cover.

AMY

Let me look.

NORVILLE

Sid found me the icepack.

AMY

Let me hold it, or you'll have a

real shiner.

NORVILLE

Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot

over this imbecile story.

AMY

...I'm sorry.

NORVILLE

Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy.

You're the one person who's been

standing by me through all this.

AMY

Norville... there's something I have

to tell you. You see, I'm not really

a secretary.

NORVILLE

I know that, Amy.

AMY

...You do?

NORVILLE

I understand that you're not very

skilled yet in the secretarial arts.

I'm not that skilled as president.

Oh sure, I put up a big front --

(massages his eye)

-- not that everyone's buying it.

AMY

I believe in you, Norville --

At least I believe in your...

intentions --

NORVILLE

Oh, I don't blame them, really. I

guess I have sort of made a mess of

things. These folks have to protect

their investment. Most of them are

very nice people --

AMY

Norville, you can't trust people

here like you did in Muncie...

AMY

...Certain people are --

NORVILLE

Didja ever go to the top of old man

Larson's feed tower and look out

over the town?

AMY

...Huh?

NORVILLE

You know, on farm route 17.

AMY

Oh yes! In Muncie!

NORVILLE

No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!

AMY

Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well

no, I -- I never really... There's a

place I go now, the cutest little

place near my apartment in Greenwich

Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's

a beatnik bar.

NORVILLE

You don't say.

AMY

Yes, you can get carrot juice or

Italian coffee, and the people there --

well, none of them quite fit in.

You'd love it -- why don't you come

there with me -- they're having a

marathon poetry reading on New Year's

Eve. I go every year.

NORVILLE

(puzzled)

Every year?

AMY

Well -- this year -- if it's good I

plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my

it certainly is beautiful --

AMY

...The people look like ants.

NORVILLE

Well, the Hindus say -- and the

beatniks also -- that in the next

life some of us will come back as

ants. Some will be butterflies.

Others will be elephants or creatures

of the sea.

AMY

What a beautiful thought.

NORVILLE

What do you think you were in your

previous life, Amy?

AMY

Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a

fast-talking career gal who thought

she was one of the boys --

NORVILLE

Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so

but I find that very farfetched.

AMY

Norville, there really is something

I have to tell you --

NORVILLE

That kind of person would come back

as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I

think it more likely that you were a

gazelle, with long, graceful legs,

gamboling through the underbrush.

Perhaps we met once, a chance

encounter in a forest glade. I must

have been an antelope or an ibex.

What times we must have had --

foraging together for sustenance,

picking the grubs and burrs from one

another's coats. Or perhaps we simply

touched our horns briefly and went

our separate ways...

AMY

I wish it were that simple, Norville.

I wish I was still a gazelle, and

you were an antelope or an ibex.

NORVILLE

Well, can I at least call you deer?

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the

whole thing is what your beatnik

friends call 'karma' -- the great

circle of life, death and rebirth.

AMY

Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

What goes around comes around.

NORVILLE

That's it. A great wheel that gives

us each what we deserve...

NORVILLE

...Tomorrow's my big presentation to

the board. I've gotta show Sidney

and the guys that I deserve all their

confidence!

AMY

Oh, Norville --

NORVILLE

Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for

luck!

AMY

Sure, Norville, sure...

AMY

...Oh, Norville!

FADE OUT:

NORVILLE

-- So we have economy, simplicity,

low production cost and the potential

for mass appeal, and all that spells

out great profitability...

NORVILLE (O.S.)

...I had the boys down at R & D throw

together this prototype so that our

discussion here could have some

focus...

NORVILLE (O.S.)

...and to give you gentlemen of the

Board a first-hand look at just how

exciting this gizmo is...

NORVILLE

...It's fun, it's healthy, it's good

exercise; kids'll just love it, and

we put a little sand inside to make

the whole experience more pleasant.

And the great part is we won't have

to charge an arm and a leg!

ELDERLY EXECUTIVE

Yeah but... What is it?

EXECUTIVE #2

Does it have rules?

EXECUTIVE #3

Can more than one play?

EXECUTIVE #4

(to #3)

What makes you think it's a game?

EXECUTIVE #3

Is it a game?

EXECUTIVE #5

Will it break?

EXECUTIVE #6

It better break eventually!

EXECUTIVE #2

Sure, sure, a blind man could tell

you that there's an enormous demand

for this, uh...

MUSSBURGER

...Congratulations, kid, you've really

outdone yourself. Reinvented the

wheel. I'm going to recommend to the

Board that we proceed immediately

with this, uh... with the, uh...

that the dingus be mass-produced

with all deliberate speed. Of course,

as president of the company the

ultimate decision is yours.

kid you not.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

...What began as the brainchild of

this Madison Avenue whiz kid is now

a craze sweeping the nation. The

'hula hoop,' product of Hudsucker

Industries, is a recreational device

that some experts predict may eclipse

the television as a means of

entertainment...

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

...This dancing dingus of delight,

this jerky circle of gaiety, is

proving to be the toy of choice of

most American youngsters. -- Whoa-

ho! Did I say youngsters?! Here's

mom, taking a break from her household

chores...

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

...and even dad is 'swinging' into

the act!

Mr. Barnes, how'd ya come up with

the idea for the hula hoop?

Well, it was no great idea, really.

A thing like this, it takes a whole

just grateful for the opportunity --

REPORTER #2

Mr. Barnes, did you have any idea

there'd be such a huge response?

NORVILLE

Well, frankly, I don't think anybody

How do you respond to the charges

that you're out of ideas? Has Norville

Barnes run dry?

NORVILLE

Not at all. Why, just this week I

came up with several new sweet ideas.

A larger model hula hoop for the

portly. A battery option for the

lazy and handicapped. A model with

more sand for hard-of-hearing. I'm

earning my keep.

REPORTER #5

Speaking of that, Mr. Barnes, do you

expect to get a raise?

NORVILLE

Well, by anyone's account I've saved

Hudsucker Industries; our stock is

worth more than it's ever been. So,

yes, I expect to be compensated for

that.

I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be

a millionaire now!

MUSSBURGER

Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires.

There's no point in looking back. At

the time, Stilson thought dumping

our position would panic the market,

further depress the stock -- then

we'd buy it all back, and more of

course, once it got cheap --

this kid and we can break him. I

say, the higher he climbs, the harder

dishonor, ignominy and disgrace.

For Pete's sake, Norville!

Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought

she said, Mamie --

AMY

Never mind about that...

AMY

...You know what those nincompoops

in the boardroom are doing?

NORVILLE

Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --

AMY

They're going to discharge eight

percent of the work force here at

Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone

that means eighteen hundred people

out of work, people with wives and

children and families --

NORVILLE

Well yes, we're pruning away some of

the dead wood, but if --

AMY

You mean you know about this?

NORVILLE

Know about it? You think the Board

would do anything like this without

my authorization? No, this was my

idea from the start.

AMY

Your i --

NORVILLE

We have to be realistic, Amy. You

know things have slowed down a little

here at Hudsucker --

AMY

You're awful kind to yourself,

Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've

slowed down, sitting up here like a

sultan, not doing a lick of work!

Why you know it's ideas that are the

lifeblood of industry and you haven't

come up with one since the hoop and

the reason's plain to see! You've

forgotten what made your ideas

exciting for you in the first place --

it wasn't for the fame and the wealth

and the mindless adulation of --

would you get out of here?!

AMY

...I've been watching you, Norville

Barnes, even though you've been trying

to avoid me --

NORVILLE

Now, Aim --

AMY

Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't

noticed how you've changed. I used

to think you were a swell guy --

well, to be honest I thought you

were an imbecile --

NORVILLE

Now, Aim --

AMY

Shutup! -- but then I figured out

you were a swell guy, a little slow

maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe

you're not so slow, but you're not

so swell either and it looks like

you're an imbecile after --

NORVILLE

Now, Aim --

AMY

Shutup! -- after all! You haven't

talked to me for a week and now I'm

going to say my piece. I've got a

prediction for you, Norville Barnes:

I predict that since you've decided

to dedicate yourself to greed and

sloth and everything bad, you're

going to lose all the good things

that your good ideas brought you.

You're going to throw them all away

chasing after money and ease and the

respect of a Board that wouldn't

give you the time of day if you...

if you...

NORVILLE

Worked in a watch factory?

GOON

Huh-huh-huh!

AMY

(to the Goon)

Shutup!

(to Norville)

Exactly! Don't you remember how you

used to feel about the hoop? You

told me you were gonna bring a smile

to the hips of everyone in America,

regardless of race, creed or color.

Finally there'd be a thingamajig

that would bring everyone together --

even if it kept 'em apart, spacially --

you know, for kids? Your words,

Norville, not mine. I used to love

Norville Barnes -- yes, love him! --

when he was just a swell kid with

hot ideas who was in over his head,

but now your head is too big to be

in over!

NORVILLE

Now, Amy --

Consider this my resignation --

Hey!!

NORVILLE

Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine

at Riverdale is really murder.

MUSSBURGER

Sure, sure, it's a tough course.

Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought

the board room would be a swell place

to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're

having some security problems here

at the Hud.

NORVILLE

Ya don't say.

MUSSBURGER

Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you

with it, but -- this is embarrassing,

kid -- it seems to concern you

directly.

NORVILLE

How's that, Sid?

MUSSBURGER

It's not important in itself --

some elevator boy you fired came to

me claiming you'd stolen the idea

for the, uh, the hoop dingus from

him --

NORVILLE

Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just --

maybe I was a little rough on the

boy, ya see I --

MUSSBURGER

Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to

explain to me. He's a little person.

He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily

it would just be a nuisance. But it

seems -- well, there was a spy in

the company...

MUSSBURGER

...Sure, sure, we tried to kill the

story. But her newspaper won't play

ball... Looks like her story's coming

out...

MUSSBURGER

...See, kid, the problem the Board'll

have... you hired this woman. Kept

her on, while she made a chump out

of you. Serious error of judgment...

I mean, business is war, kid -- ya

take no prisoners, ya get no second

chances. And a boner like this...

I'm afraid when the Board meets,

after New Year's, your position...

well, it looks like you're finished...

stick a fork in ya, you're done...

washed up...

MUSSBURGER (O.S.)

...I'm sorry, kid. I understand this

dolly who betrayed you, she used to

be a friend of yours...

MUSSBURGER (O.S.)

...And this elevator dope used to be

a friend, too...

MUSSBURGER (O.S.)

...Well, they've got your throat

pretty well slit. And when you're

dead, ya stay dead. Ya don't believe

me, ask Waring Hudsucker... Yeah,

looks like curtains. Well,

condolences, kid...

is Gunderson did design it --

HUDSUCKER (ANGEL)

Ta-daaaa!

HUDSUCKER

...Wooooo!

HUDSUCKER

...How d'ya like this thing? They're

all wearin' em upstairs now.

HUDSUCKER

...It's a fad.

HUDSUCKER

...Anyway. I hear you've been having,

uh...

HUDSUCKER

...Been having some problems with

the board. The more things change,

know what Iyayayeeeeee...

HUDSUCKER

...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts...

Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I

guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws

to ya, huh, Norman?

NORVILLE

Norville.

HUDSUCKER

Mm. Well, say what you like about

the man's ethics, he's a balls-to-

the-wall businessman. Beat ya any

way he can. Straight for the jugular.

Very effective.

NORVILLE

Yes sir...

HUDSUCKER

Anyway. Any particular reason you

didn't give him my Blue Letter? I

mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying

man's last words and wishes, no big

deal.

NORVILLE

Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I

apologize, there was an awful lot of

excitement and I guess I must've

mislaid --

HUDSUCKER

It's sittin' in your apron pocket,

right where you left it. Imbecile.

NORVILLE

Oh, geez.

HUDSUCKER

Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is

grounds for dismissal.

NORVILLE

Geez, I --

HUDSUCKER

Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna

add to your woes. I'm just saying.

NORVILLE

Yessir.

HUDSUCKER

Well, why don't ya read it.

NORVILLE

Sir?

HUDSUCKER

Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.

NORVILLE

Yes sir...

NORVILLE

'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker.

To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding.

My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you

read this, I will have joined the

organization upstairs -- an exciting

new beginning. I will retain fond

memories of the many years you and I --

'

HUDSUCKER

Yeah, yeah, it's the standard

resignation boilerplate -- go down

to the second paragraph.

NORVILLE

'Many years, uh... I know that you

will be wondering why I have decided

to move on, ending my tenure at

Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You

will be thinking, Why now, when things

are going so well? Granted, from the

standpoint of our balance sheet and

financials, sure, sure, we're doing

fine. However, Sid. These things

have long since ceased to give me

pleasure. I look at myself now and

no longer see the idealistic young

man who started this company. Now I

see only an empty shell whom others

call a 'success.' How has this come

to pass? When and why did I trade

all of my hopes, dreams and

aspirations, for the emptiness of

power and wealth? What the heck have

I done?

NORVILLE

'...Looking back now, Sid, I see

that I allowed time and age to corrupt

my dreams. Instead of fiercely

guarding what was timeless inside of

myself, I let the hubbub of earthly

commerce erode my character, and

dissolve my better self. How is it

that some manage to preserve

themselves where I have failed?

Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if

others love you, you may more securely

love yourself -- but I am alone. I

loved a woman once, Sid, as you well

know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady,

an angel who in her wisdom saw fit

to choose you instead of I...'

HUDSUCKER

Skip this part...

HUDSUCKER

...Last paragraph, last paragraph.

NORVILLE

'...And so, Sid, the future does not

belong to such as I -- nor even you.

We have made our compromises with

time. The future belongs to the young,

who may more energetically wage the

battle against corruption.

Accordingly, in the spirit of hope,

and the ringing in of the new, I

hereby bequeath my entire interest

in the company, and my seat on the

board, to whomever is Hudsucker's

most recent employee at the time of

my demise. I know this will disappoint

you -- you, Sid, who have served so

diligently and for so long. But --'

HUDSUCKER

-- tough titty toenails!

HUDSUCKER

...That'll show the bastard!

HUDSUCKER

...Yeah, go ahead.

NORVILLE

'...But Sid, let me urge you to work

closely with the new president, and

to keep giving Hudsucker Industries

all your energies -- but not your

soul. For while we must strive for

success, we must not worship it.

Long live the Hud. Waring

Hudsucker...'

HUDSUCKER

...Geez.

HUDSUCKER

Yup. It's all there. Well, see that

it gets delivered in the morning.

HUDSUCKER

Sheeel beeee...

HUDSUCKER

...Ridin' six white horses, She'll

be ridin' six white horses She'll be

ridin' six white horses When she

comes...

LOU (O.S.)

What the heck's he doin', Benny?

BENNY (O.S.)

What the heck's she doin', Lou?

LOU (O.S.)

What the heck they doin'?

BENNY (O.S.)

You know what they're doin' now,

Lou.

LOU (O.S.)

This I know, Benny.

BENNY (O.S.)

This you're familia' with.

LOU (O.S.)

...Geez.

BENNY (O.S.)

...Geez.

LOU (O.S.)

...Y'all right, Benny?

BENNY (O.S.)

...Yeah, I'm... It's just... It's

beautiful, Lou!

LOU (O.S.)

It is beautiful, Benny.

BENNY (O.S.)

...It's the most beautiful t'ing I

ever saw.

LOU (O.S.)

It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever

saw.

BARTENDER

You cats comin' from a party?

BENNY

Cabbies' affair.

LOU

Hacks' New Year's gala.

BARTENDER

Crazy. Get you anything else? Sangria?

Carrot juice? Herbal tea?

LOU

Bromo.

BENNY

...Bromo.

MOSES (V.O.)

And so began 1959. The new year...

MOSES (V.O.)

...And the start of a new business

cycle. When he learned that Norville

owned the comp'ny, ol' Sidney was

upset at first.

MOSES (V.O.)

...It's a good thing Doc

Bromfenbrenner was there...

MOSES (V.O.)

...'cause he was able to keep Sidney

from harmin' his ol' self.

CUT TO:

MOSES (V.O.)

...Now Norville, he went on an' ruled

with wisdom and compassion...

MOSES (V.O.)

...and started dreamin' up them

excitin' new ideas again. You know,

for kids!

MOSES (V.O.)

...An' that's the story of how

Norville Barnes climbed away up to

the forty-fourth floor of the

Hudsucker Buildin'...

CUT TO:

MOSES (V.O.)

...an' then fell all the way down,

but didn't quite squish hisself.

MOSES (V.O.)

...Ya know, they say there was a man

who jumped from the fortyfifth

floor... but that's another story.

Heh-heh-heh! Ya-heh-heh-heh!

THE END
