BEING JOHN MALKOVICH A Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman

BEING JOHN MALKOVICH

A Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman

CUT TO:

LOTTE

Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin

Hatch was out of his pen. Good

morning.

CRAIG

Morning.

LOTTE

Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms

coming in first thing.

CRAIG

Enjoy.

LOTTE

Craig, listen, honey, I've been

thinking... maybe you'd feel better

if you got, you know, a job or

something.

CRAIG

We've been over this. Nobody's

looking for a puppeteer in today's

wintry economic climate.

LOTTE

Well, you know, maybe something else

until this whole puppet thing turns

around.

CRAIG

(bitterly)

The Great Mantini doesn't need a day

job.

LOTTE

(sighs)

Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.

(beat)

Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me

a favor?

CRAIG

What?

LOTTE

Would you check in on Elijah? He seems

to be a little under the weather this

morning.

CRAIG

Which one is Elijah again?

LOTTE

The monkey.

CRAIG

Yeah. Okay.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TV ANNOUNCER

The crowd is enthralled as Derek

Mantini, arguably the greatest

puppeteer in the history of the

world, performs "The Belle of

Amherst" with his 60 foot Emily

Dickinson puppet, directed by the

inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly.

CHARLES NELSON REILLY

Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong.

CRAIG

Gimmicky bastard.

LOTTE

Is the trial date set?

CRAIG

May 11th.

More silence.

LOTTE

Why'd you do it, Craig?

CRAIG

I'm a puppeteer.

CUT TO:

LOTTE

(finally)

Why, Craig. why?

CRAIG

(through fat lip)

I... puppeteer.

LOTTE

(finally)

You know, maybe you should speak to

someone about this.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOMAN #1

Seven and a half, right?

CRAIG

Uh. yeah.

WOMAN #1

I'll take you through it.

WOMAN #1

Seven and a half.

CRAIG

Thank you.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FLORIS

Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet

your filing needs?

CRAIG

No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz.

I have an interview with Mr. Lester.

FLORIS

Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...

CRAIG

Schwartz.

FLORIS

Pardon?

CRAIG

Schwartz.

FLORIS

I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea

what you're saying right now.

CRAIG

My name is Schwartz.

FLORIS

Money, Miss Warts?

CRAIG

Forget it.

FLORIS

(calling across the room)

Fork ah did?

FLORIS

(to Craig)

Mr. Juarez?

CRAIG

Yes?

FLORIS

Yex?

CRAIG

I said "yes."

FLORIS

You suggest what? I have no time for

piddling suggestions from mumbling job

applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr.

Lester will see you now. I think

that's what he said.

CUT TO:

LESTER

Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but,

well, you know.

CRAIG

(extending his hand)

Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz,

Dr. Lester.

LESTER

Security.

CRAIG

No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with

your secretary.

LESTER

She's not my secretary. She's what

they call an executive liaison, and

I'm not banging her, if that's what

youre implying.

CRAIG

Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply

misspoke.

LESTER

Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you

feel you can bring to LesterCorp?

CRAIG

Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.

LESTER

(crafty)

You think so, eh? Which comes first,

L or... Glooph?

CRAIG

Glooph is not a letter, sir.

LESTER

Damn, you are good. I tried to trick

you. Okay, put these in order.

LESTER (CONT'D)

(flips intercom switch)

Floris, get Guinness on the phone.

FLORIS (O.S.)

Gehginnis ondah foam?

LESTER

Forget it.

FLORIS (CONT'D)

Fork ah did?

LESTER

(flips off switch)

Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how

she puts up with this damn speech

impediment of mine.

CRAIG

You don't have a speech impediment,

Dr. Lester.

LESTER

Flattery will get you everywhere,

my boy. But I'm afraid I have to

trust Floris on this one. You see,

she has her doctorate in speech

impedimentology from Case Western.

Perhaps you've read her memoirs,

"I can't understand a word any of

you are saying."

CRAIG

No.

LESTER

Pity, it tells it like it is.

That's why the eastern, read Jewish,

publishing establishment won't touch

it. That's a quote from the book

jacket. George Will, I think.

(beat)

I apologize if you can't understan

a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.

CRAIG

No. I understand perfectly.

LESTER

(choking up)

Thank you for being kind enough to

lie. You see, I've been very lonely

in my isolated tower of

indecipherable speech. You're hired.

Any questions?

CRAIG

Just one. Why is this floor so short?

LESTER

Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the

savings on to you.

(laughs heartily)

But seriously, that's all covered in

orientation.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NARRATOR (0.S.)

Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor of the

Mertin-Flemmer building. As you

will now be spending your work day

here, it is important that you learn

a bit about the history of this

famous floor.

DISSOLVE TO:

WENDY

Hello, Don.

DON

Hello. Wendy.

WENDY

Don, I was wondering, do you know

why our workplace has such low

ceilings?

DON

It's an interesting story, Wendy.

Many years ago in the late 1800's,

James Mertin, an Irish ship captain

looking to invest in the future of

our great country, came to this town

and decided to erect an office

building.

CUT TO:

DON (CONT'D) (V.0.)

He would call this building the

Mertin-Flemmer Building, after

himself and someone else, who, local

legend has it, was named Flemmer.

CUT TO:

DON (CONT'D) (V.0.)

One day. Captain Mertin received an

unexpected visitor.

MERTIN

Enter ye, if ye dare enter.

TINY WOMAN

Captain Mertin?

MERTIN

What want ye, girl child?

TINY WOMAN

I am not a child, Captain Mertin,

but rather an adult lady of miniature

proportions.

MERTIN

(taken aback)

I see. Well, it is not my fault that

thou art tiny. So if it is charity

yer after, then be gone with ye,

ye foul demon.

TINY WOMAN

I am not asking for alms, but rather

the ear of a kind man with a noble

heart.

MERTIN

(sighs)

Aye. Speak then if ye must.

TINY WOMAN

Captain Mertin, surely I am a

God-fearing Christian woman like

yourself, but alas, I am afraid that

the world was not built with me in

mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs

are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms

mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie

lady, Captain. after all, who would

marry a person of my diminutiveness?

So I am forced to work for my few

pennies a week as an optometrist.

Why cannot there be a place for me

to work safe and comfortable?

MERTIN

Woman, your story moves me like n

other. Me own sister was tiny and

then died. Therefore, I shall make

ye me wife. And I shall build a

floor in my building, between the

7th and 8th, which will be scaled

down, so from now on there shall

be at least one place on God's green

Earth that you and your accursed

kind can live in peace...

DISSOLVE TO:

DON

So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since

the rents are considerably lower

this floor has been adopted by

businesses which for one reason

or another are forced to cut corners

After all... the overhead is low!

Ha ha ha!

WENDY

Ha ha ha!

CUT TO:

CRAIG

Moving story.

MAXINE

Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit.

The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil

that it could never be revealed

to Americans raised on sitcoms and

happy news anchors.

CRAIG

Is that true?

MAXINE

Well, truth is for suckers, isn't

it?.

CRAIG

Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just

starting out at LesterCorp.

MAXINE

How dreary - to be - Somebody /

How public - like a Frog /

To tell one's name - the livelong June /

To an admiring Bog!

CRAIG

(proudly)

Emily Dickinson.

MAXINE

I wouldn't know.

CUT TO:

PARROT

Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

CRAIG

Shut up!

LOTTE

(to Craig)

Sorry, honey.

PARROT

Sorry honey. Sorry honey.

NEIGHBOR (0.S.)

Shut up!

LOTTE

(yelling)

Sorry!

PARROT (0.S.)

Help! She's locking me in a cage!

LOTTE

Isn't that cute? I just taught her

that.

CRAIG

Adorable. What time are they supposed

to be here?

LOTTE

Seven-ish

CRAIG

We have to make it an early night.

LOTTE

They'll understand. Besides I've got

a morning appointment tomorrow with

Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the

bottom of this acid stomach.

CRAIG

(not paying attention)

Hmmm.

LOTTE

Some sort of childhood trauma, she

thinks. Possible feelings of

inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting,

huh?

CRAIG

Hmmm.

DISSOLVE TO:

PETER

Good food, Lotte.

LOTTE

Thanks. Craig helped, too, by the

way.

PETER

Vegetarian, right?

LOTTE

Yes. All vegetable. all the time.

PETER

Amazing.

PETER (CONT'D)

No kidding about that 7 1/2 floor.

Craig?

CRAIG

No kidding, Peter.

GLORIA

That's great. It almost sounds like

make-believe.

(beat)

Like a storybook.

(beat)

like a fairy tale.

(beat)

It's really great.

(beat)

So Lotte, when you say all vegetable,

do you mean all vegetable entire1y?

CUT TO:

GLORIA

Lotte told me that Eskimos have a

lot of words for snow.

PETER

How many?

GLORIA

Ten, I think.

PETER

I wonder why so many.

GLORIA

Because they have a lot of snow.

Isn't that interesting?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FLORIS

You're good.

CRAIG

(over-enunciating)

Thank you, Floris.

FLORIS

You're not like the other boys

we've had here. Granted, I can't

understand what you're saying either,

but your soft palette resonates

tremendously well and you never

ever constrict your epiglottis.

CRAIG

I am a trained performer.

FLORIS

(swooning)

Music to my ears! Whatever you said.

Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent

friend, speak!

CUT TO:

CRAIG

Hello again.

MAXINE

Yes, well...

CRAIG

You know, I've been thinking about

what you said yesterday, about the

orientation film being a cover-up.

I think you're on to something.

MAXINE

And fifty other lines to get into

a girl's pants.

CRAIG

No, really.

MAXINE

You know, if you ever got me, you

wouldn't have a clue what to do

with me. That's the thing, Romeo.

CUT TO:

LOTTE

New puppet?

CRAIG

Yeah, just an idea I had.

LOTTE

She's very beautiful.

CRAIG

(shrugging)

Just an idea I had.

CRAIG (CONT'D)

C'mon, let's go to bed.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CRAIG

(quietly)

I would too know what to do with you.

CUT TO:

FLORIS

Oh, what magic those fingers could

work on the right cabinet.

(strokes Craig's neck)

Alphabetize me, baby. And don't

forget, I comes before U.

CRAIG

Floris, you're very nice, but I'm

afraid Im in love with somebody

else.

FLORIS

(upset)

I'm afraid I... have no idea what

you are saying... you bastard!

LESTER

Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz.

Why, if I were eighty years younger,

I'd box your ears.

CRAIG

I wasn't toying with her, sir. I

was just... How old are you?

LESTER

One hundred and five. Carrot juice.

(beat)

Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost

not worth it. I piss orange. Oh,

and I, have to piss sitting down...

like a godamn girly... every fifteen

minutes. But nobody wants to die,

Schwartz.

CRAIG

I'll keep that in mind, sir.

LESTER

No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what

I do is get older, wrinkled like a

former plum that's become the

wrinkled prune you see before you.

Oh, to be a young man again, maybe

then Floris would care for me.

CRAIG

The elderly have so much to offer,

sir. They are our link with history.

LESTER

I don't want to be your godamn link,

damn you. I want to feel Floris'

naked thighs against my own. I want

to know passion. I want my body to

inspire lust in that beautiful,

complex woman. I want her to shiver

in a spasm of ecstasy when I

penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony

of the flesh, Schwartz.

CRAIG

Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that

you share your feelings with me, I

believe perhaps the workplace is not

the most suitable environment for

this type of discussion.

LESTER

All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice

Juice Bar after work today and I'll

spill my goddamn guts for you.

CRAIG

Shit.

CUT TO:

CRAIG

(into phone)

I won't be late. I just have to

listen to Lester's sexual fantasies

and drink carrot juice for a little

while. It's a job thing.

CRAIG (CONT'D)

(into phone)

I gotta go back to work. Yeah,

okay. You too. Okay. Bye.

MAXINE

What?

CRAIG

I just wanted to say hi.  Did

you know I still don't know your

name or where you work?

MAXINE

Yeah.

CRAIG

How about this, if I can guess your

first name within three tries, you

have to come out for a drink with me

tonight.

MAXINE

Why not?

CRAIG

Great.

(watches her face as he guesses)

Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . .

Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. .

nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . .

tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . .

nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee

Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . .

sssseeeeeen. Maxine?

MAXINE

Who told you?

CRAIG

I'm right?

MAXINE

Who told you?

CRAIG

That's incredible! Nobody told me!

I swear! It's kismet. Maxine!

It's a beautiful name. There's a

psychic connection. Don't you see?

It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine!

Maxine! I will shout it from the

rooftops!

MAXINE

Somebody told you.

CRAIG

Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine,

Maxine. It just came out of me like

a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy,

song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!

MAXINE

I am dubious, but I don't welsh.

Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven

o'clock. You're late, I walk. So

help me, if I find out you cheated.

CRAIG

(in heaven)

Maxine.

CUT TO:

LESTER

Imagine a room full of women.

Nubile, blonde, wet with desire,

Schwartz. A harem, if you will.

Me in leather. A harness, if you

like. I am the object of this

desire, and all eyes are on me as

I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am

the love god, Eros. I intoxicate

you. My spunk is to you manna from

heaven...

CRAIG

(standing)

Dr. Lester, it's been really

fascinating, but I'm afraid I have

to get home to my wife now.

LESTER

Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her,

Craig.

CRAIG

Yessir.

LESTER

Shall we say dinner on Friday.

Just the two of us?

(afterthought)

You can come too if you like,

Schwartz.

CRAIG

(checking watch)

That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta

run.

CUT TO:

CRAIG

Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine,

Maxine.

MAXINE

Just.

CRAIG

Buy you a drink, Maxine?

MAXINE

You married?

CRAIG

Yeah. But enough about me.

CRAIG (CONT'D)

What'll you have?

MAXINE

(to bartender)

The usual, Barry.

CRAIG

(to bartender)

I'll have, like, a beer. Like a

Budweiser, or something.

CRAIG (CONT'D)

I like you. I don't know what it

is exactly.

MAXINE

My tits?

CRAIG

No, no, it's your energy or your

attitude or the way you carry

yourself or...

MAXINE

Christ, you're not a fag are you?

Because I don't want to be wasting

my time.

CRAIG

That's the usual?

MAXINE

Dont let the girly shit fool you.

It'd blow your shorts off.

MAXINE (CONT'D)

Set me up again, Barry.

CRAIG

Im not a homosexual. I just like

women for more than their bodies.

I guess you could say I'm the new

American male.

MAXINE

You're a fag or a liar.

CRAIG

(backpedaling)

I mean, I am really attracted to

you.

MAXINE

(mocking)

I mean, I am really attracted to

you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can

share recipes, if you like, Darlene.

CRAIG

(at a loss)

No, wait! I like your tits.

(beat)

I love your tits. I want to fuck

you.

MAXINE

(sitting)

Good. Now we're getting somewhere.

(beat)

Not a chance.

MAXINE (CONTD)

So, tell me about yourself. If you

can get your mind out of the gutter

long enough, dog-boy.

CRAIG

Well, I'm a puppeteer...

MAXINE

(to bartender)

Check.

CUT TO:

CRAIG

Hi.

LOTTE

Hi.

CRAIG

(nervous, talking too much)

Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just

wouldn't let me go. Were supposed

to have dinner with him on Friday.

I can get us out of it if you want.

He's really amazing, this insane old

lech. It's actually sort of amusing

when you get past just how disgusting

it is.

LOTTE

Did you eat?

CRAIG

Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I

didn't call. It was just, you know,

hard to get away.

LOTTE

I was worried.

CRAIG

I'm sorry. How was your evening?

LOTTE

Tom-Tom's puncture wound is

infected.

CRAIG

The ferret?

LOTTE

The iguana.

CRAIG

Right.

LOTTE

I dressed the wound. Then I've

just been feeding everyone, putting

everyone to bed.

CRAIG

Yeah. You want a beer?

LOTTE

No thanks. I'm going to turn in.

CRAIG

All right. I'll be in my workshop

for a little while. I'll be in in

a little while. I need to unwind a

little.

(beat)

I'll be in soon. A little while.

LOTTE

'kay.

CUT TO:

CRAIG

(as Maxine, fascinated)

Tell me, Craig, why do you love

puppeteering?

(as Craig)

Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly.

Perhaps it's the idea of becoming

someone else for a little while.

Being inside another skin. Moving

differently, thinking differently,

feeling differently.

(as Maxine)

Interesting. Would you like to be

inside my skin, Craig? Think what I

think? Feel what I feel?

(as Craig)

More than anything. Maxine.

(as Maxine)

It's good in here, Craig. Better

than your wildest dreams.

CUT TO:

CRAIG

Hi.

MAXINE

You're not someone I could get

interested in. Craig. You play

with dolls.

CRAIG

(rehearsed)

Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea

of being inside someone else,

feeling what they feel, seeing

what they see...

MAXINE

Yikes.

CRAIG

Please, let me explain.

CUT TO:

CRAIG

It's just, and I've never done

this before, Maxine, but it's just

that I feel something for you. I've

never felt this before for anyone,

not even my wife. My future is with

you, Maxine.

MAXINE

You might want to check those tarot

cards one more time.

CRAIG

Another evil secret of the 7 1/2

floor.

CRAIG

Holy shit. Maxine is gonna love

this.

CUT TO:

LESTER

Yes?

CRAIG

Dr. Lester. . .

LESTER

Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted

to see.

(proudly spreading his arms)

Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your

fingers clear of the blade, and

never, never use it while bathing in

a tub full of water.

CRAIG

Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was

in that vacant office down the hall

and I stumbled upon a little door

and....

LESTER

Ah. yes, the little door.

(checks watch)

There is a short film on the little

door in the orientation room in

exactly two minutes. If you hurry,

you'll just make it.

CRAIG

Thank you, sir.

LESTER

Put up reel 752.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DON

Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in

this vacant office.

WENDY

Well, Don, I peeked in here, even

though I know it's against floor

policy. and I discovered that

there's a little tiny door in here.

Isn't it cute? It's almost like a

little dolly's door. I wonder what

its for.

DON

(laughing)

That's right, Wendy, it is against

floor policy, but as long as you're

here, let me tell you what I know

about our cute little door friend.

Many years ago, this very office

was occupied by a kindly old

watchmaker named Mr. White.

DISSOLVE TO:

WHITE

Hmmm. I must have a small store

room to store my merchandise when

I am through working on it. I know,

I will build a tiny store room.

How cute!

DISSOLVE TO:

WENDY

Wow! That's some story, Don.

DON

Truth is stranger than fiction,

Wendy!

CUT TO:

CRAIG

Bullshit.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CRAIG (CONT'D) (V.0.)

(losing his balance)

Whoa! What the hell? Where am I?

CRAIG (CONT'D) (V.0.)

Holy shit! It's that actor guy.

Shit! What's his name? That actor

guy! What's happening? Am I

inside him? Am I in his brain?

Am I him? Is he me? Does he know

I'm here? My brain is reeling!

Is his brain reeling?

CUT TO:

MAXINE

The puppeteer told me he loves me

today.

(laughs)

I know. I can't think of anything

more pathetic.

CUT TO:

MALKOVICH (V.0.)

(resonant throughout)

The Broadhurst Theater, please.

CABBIE

Say, aren't you that actor guy?

MALKOVICH

Yeah.

CABBIE

John Makel...

CRAIG (V.0.)

John Malkovich! Of course!

CABBIE

Mapplethorpe?

MALKOVICH (V.0.)

Malkovich.

CABBIE

Malkovich!

CRAIG (V.0.)

John fucking Malkovich!

CABBIE

Yeah. I liked you in that one movie.

MALKOVICH (V.0.)

Thank you.

CABBIE

The one where you're that jewel

thief.

MALKOVICH

I never played a jewel thief.

CABBIE

Who am I thinking of?

MALKOVICH

I don't know.

CABBIE

I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey,

could I get your autograph now?

It's for .... oh, what the hell,

it's for me! I'm your biggest

fan!

MALKOVICH

Yeah, okay.

CRAIG (V.0.)

(panicky)

Ahhhh!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MAXINE

Absolutely, doll. I'm just about

to close up here.

MAXINE (CONTD)

(into phone)

Meet you at The Pig in twenty

minutes.

(laughs lasciviously)

Oh yeah, maybe I'll keep my legs

closed till then.

(hangs up. to Craig)

I'm splitting for the day. Lock up

for me, won't you, darling.

CRAIG

Don't you want to know what happened

to me?

MAXINE

(considers)

No.

CRAIG

This is important!

MAXINE

(looking at his hand on her arm)

It better be.

CRAIG

There's a tiny door in that empty

office. It's a portal, Maxine. It

takes you inside John Malkovich.

You see the world through John

Malkovich's eyes, then, after about

fifteen minutes, you're spit out into

a ditch on the side of The New Jersey

Turnpike.

MAXINE

Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is

John Malkovich?

CRAIG

He's an actor. One of the great

American actors of the 20th century.

MAXINE

What's he been in?

CRAIG

Lots of things. He's very well

respected. That jewel thief movie,

for example. The point is that this

is a very odd thing, supernatural,

for lack of a better word. It raises

all sorts of philosophical questions

about the nature of self, about the

existence of the soul. Am I me? Is

Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha

right, is duality an illusion? Do

you see what a can of worms this

portal is? I don't think I can go

on living my life as I have lived

it. There's only one thing to do.

Let's get married right away.

MAXINE

Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?

CRAIG

Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.

MAXINE

Good. We'll sell tickets.

CRAIG

Tickets to Malkovich?

MAXINE

Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.

CRAIG

But there's something profound here,

Maxine, we can't exploit it.

MAXINE

Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going

to offer a partnership to you, but

this way it's more money for me.

CRAIG

You wanted to be partners with me?

MAXINE

(bored)

Sure. It'd be fun.

CRAIG

(pleased)

Really?

(then:)

But, Maxine, can of worms! End of

the world! Illusory nature of

existence!

MAXINE

I'll protect you, Dollface.

CRAIG

(in love)

Oh. Maxine.

DISSOLVE TO:

LOTTE

Don't be ridiculous. There is no such

thing as a portal into someone else's

brain.

CRAIG

Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte.

I was right inside him looking out.

We're going to be rich.

LOTTE

I want to try.

CRAIG

What?

LOTTE

I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow

morning. Plus I'd like to meet this

partner of yours.

CRAIG

(nervously)

Well, you know we're going to be

very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you

what. Let's do it tonight. Right

now.

LOTTE

Now?

CRAIG

Yeah. We'll do it right now. On

the way to Lester's house.

CUT TO:

CRAIG

I'll meet you on the turnpike.

LOTTE

I'm scared.

CRAIG

Me too, babe.

CUT TO:

LOTTE (V.0.)

Holy cow!

LOTTE (V.0.)

Oh, yes. Yes.

CUT TO:

LOTTE

I have to go back.

CRAIG

Okay. Maybe tomorrow.

LOTTE

I have to go back now.

CRAIG

We'll talk about it in the car.

CUT TO:

LOTTE

I have to go back, Craig. Being

inside did something to me. All of a

sudden everything made sense. I knew

who I was.

CRAIG

You weren't you. You were John

Malkovich.

LOTTE

(tickled)

I was, wasn't I?

(yelling out the window)

I was John fucking Malkovich!

(laughs, then intensely)

Take me back, Craig.

CRAIG

Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.

CUT TO:

LESTER

Tell me, Lotte, can you understand

a word I'm saying?

LOTTE

Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.

LESTER

Oh, be still my heart.

LOTTE

Dr. Lester, would you point me

toward the restroom?

LESTER

With immense pleasure, my dear. Down

that hall, ninth door on the left.

Watch the step down. It's sunken,

you know.

CRAIG

Dr. Lester...

LESTER

More beet-spinach juice, my friend?

CRAIG

No thank you sir. It's delicious,

though. I just wanted to thank you

for the opportunity to work at

LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm

going to have to tender my resignation

effectively immediately.

LESTER

I see. Are you unhappy at our little

company?

CRAIG

No sir, not at all. It's just that

I'm going to open my own business

and...

LESTER

And what sort of business will this

be? If you don't mind my asking.

CRAIG

Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right

on 7 1/2 actually.

(beat)

In the vacant office. So we'll still

be seeing each other.

LESTER

The vacant office. I see. Olive oil.

Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz,

there are certain doors which

should never be opened.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CRAIG

My kingdom for your portal, Maxine.

CUT TO:

MAXINE

Okay. Here it is.

(reading)

Ever want to be someone else? Now you

can. No kidding. Only two hundred

dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit

J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building.

etc., etc.

CRAIG

Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing.

Phone it in.

CRAIG

Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet

shop?

LOTTE

Fuck pets. Is this your partner?

I had to come back and do the

Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything

else. Is this her?

MAXINE

(into phone)

Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.

(to Lotte)

Hi, are you Craig's wife?

LOTTE

Yes, Hi.

CRAIG

Lotte, Maxine. Maxine, Lotte.

LOTTE

Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?

MAXINE

Hi, uh.

(into phone)

Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes.

"Ever want to be someone else?"

No, that's the ad, but let's talk

about you in a minute. "Ever want

to be someone else? Now you can.

No kidding..."

CRAIG

(to Lotte)

Why aren't you at work?

LOTTE

I've been going over and over my

experience last night. It was amazing.

(beat)

I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't

that the craziest thing?

CRAIG

What, are you nuts? That's Oprah

talking.

LOTTE

Everything felt right for the first

time. I need to go back to make sure,

then if the feeling is still there.

I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman

about sexual reassignment surgery.

CRAIG

This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an

allergist. If you're going to do

something, do it right.

CRAIG (cont'd)

(beat)

It's just the thrill of seeing through

someone else's eyes, sweetie. It'll

pass.

LOTTE

Don't stand in the way of my

actualization as a man, Craig.

MAXINE

(hanging up the phone)

Let her go, Craig. I mean him."

CRAIG

(anything for Maxine)

Yeah, okay.

(opens the portal door)

I'll pick you up.

MAXINE

You better hurry. Traffic.

MAXINE (CONT'D)

(into phone)

Davey? Max. Get me John Malkovich's

home phone? That's great. Love ya

and owe ya.

CUT TO:

MALKOVICH

(reading aloud)

So you believe in God... you got

something for it? You worked for

all the capitalists. You harvested

the fruit from your labor? You got

God!

LOTTE (V.0.)

What raw, animal power!

MALKOVICH

But the past comforts you? The

present smiles on you, yes?

MALKOVICH (CONT'D)

(into phone)

Yeah?

MAXINE (0.S.)

(telephone voice)

Mr. Malkovich?

MALKOVICH

Who's calling?

MAXINE (0.S.)

You don't know me, but I'm a great

admirer of yours.

MALKOVICH

How'd you get this number?

MAXINE (0.S.)

It's just that I fantasize about

you and, well, speaking to you

now has gotten me sort of excited

and...

LOTTE (0.S.)

(turned on)

Oh, I like this.

MALKOVICH

Listen, this is not amusing. Please

don't call here any...

MAXINE (0.S.) (giggling)

Ooh, such authority! NY nipples are

at attention, General Malkovich, sir.

So I'll be at Bernardo's tonight at

eight. Please, please meet me there.

I just adored you in that jewel thief

movie...

LOTTE (V.O.)

My God!

(attempting thought control)

Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet

her there. Meet her there. Meet her

there...

LOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet

her there...

CUT TO:

CRAIG

How was it?

LOTTE

I have to go back tonight. At eight

Exactly.

CRAIG

Why?

LOTTE

Don't crowd me, Craig.

CUT TO:

GUY

Excuse me, are you John Malkovich?

MALKOVICH

Yes.

GUY

Wow. You were really great in that

movie where you played that retard.

MALKOVICH

Thank you very much.

GUY

I just wanted to tell you that. And

say thank you. I have a cousin that's

a retard, so, as you can imagine, it

means a lot to me to see retards

portrayed on the silver screen so

compassionately.

LOTTE (V.O.)

Maxine!

MAXINE

Hi. I'm so glad you decided to

come. I'm Maxine.

MALKOVICH

I'm John. I didn't think I was going

to come, but I felt oddly compelled.

I have to admit I was a bit intrigued

by your voice.

LOTTE (V.O.)

God, she's beautiful. The way she's

looking at me. At him. At us.

MAXINE

And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich,

my voice is probably the least

intriguing thing about me.

LOTTE (V.O.)

I've never been looked at like this

by a woman.

MALKOVICH

Can I get you a drink?

MAXINE

Whatever you're having.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S CAR - NIGHT

CRAIG

So how was it? What was he doing?

LOTTE

Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging

around his apartment. I think he must

be a lonely man.

CRAIG

You see, men can feel unfulfilled,

too. I'm glad you're realizing that.

You shouldn't be so quick to assume

that switching bodies would be the

answer to all your problems.

LOTTE

You're right. You know I was thinking

that we should have Maxine over for

dinner. Since you two are partners

and all. It might be a nice gesture.

CRAIG

I don't know. There's some tension

between us. I'd hate to expose you to

that.

LOTTE

It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna.

Well smoke a joint.

(dreamily)

Tensions will melt away.

CUT TO:

LOTTE

(to Maxine)

Did you know that Eskimos have not

one, but fifty words for snow. It's

because they have so much of it.

CRAIG

After dinner I'll show you my puppets.

MAXINE

Ah.

LOTTE

After that I'll introduce you to my

favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an

ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood

trauma. But we're getting to the

bottom of it.

(whispers)

Psychotherapy.

MAXINE

(to no one in particular)

The way I see it, the world is divide

into those go after what they want

and those who don't. The passionate

ones, the ones who go after what they

want, may not get what they want, but

they remain vital, in touch with

themselves, and when they lie on

their deathbeds, they have few

regrets. The ones who don't go

after what they want... well, who

gives a shit about them anyway?

CRAIG

You?

MAXINE

Craig, I just don't find you

attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten

with you, but only when you're in

Malkovich. When I looked into his

eyes last night, I could feel you

peering out. Behind the stubble and

the too-prominent brow and the male

pattern baldness, I sensed your

feminine longing peering out, and

it just slew me.

CRAIG

(disgusted)

My God.

MAXINE

(to Lotte, removing her hand)

Only to John, sweetie. I'm sorry.

(gets up)

Thanks for a wonderful dinner.

(walks past kitchen. to Craig)

No hard feelings, partner.

LOTTE

I want a divorce.

CUT TO:

CRAIG

(a little too urgently)

Come in!

ERROLL

Hello, I'm here about the ad.

CRAIG

Please, have a seat.

ERROLL

When you say, I can be somebody

else, what do you mean exactly?

CRAIG

Exactly that. We can put you inside

someone else's body for fifteen minutes.

ERROLL

Oh, this is just the medical

breakthrough I've been waiting for.

Are their any side effects? Please

say no! Please say no!

MAXINE

No.

ERROLL

Long term psychic or physiological

repercussions?

MAXINE

No. Don't be an ass.

ERROLL

Can I be anyone I want?

MAXINE

You can be John Malkovich.

ERROLL

Well that's perfect. My second

choice. Ah, this is wonderful.

Too good to be true! You see, I'm

a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh,

I've tried all the diets, my friends.

Lived for a year on nothing but

imitation mayonnaise. Did it work?

You be the judge. But Malkovich!

King of New York! Man about town!

Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant!

The Schopenhauer of the 20th century!

Thin man extraordinaire!

MAXINE

Two hundred dollars, please.

ERROLL

Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!

CUT TO:

ERROLL

Oh, thank you! Thank you!

Thousand times, thank you!

CRAIG

(gasping for air)

Tell your friends.

ERROLL

Oh, I will, and I have many,

many friends and associates, my

friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters

Anonymous. All of them fat and alone

like me, all of them dream of being

someone else, all of them with John

Malkovich as their second choice!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CRAIG

This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!

MAXINE

So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.

LESTER

You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.

(nods to Maxine)

Ma'am

CRAIG

Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're

talking about.

LESTER

There are rules, boy, procedures,

etiquette. This is not a toy. I've

been waiting seventy years to utilize

this room, grooming myself, quietly

setting the stage, performing

ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all

his motion pictures again and again.

Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping

properly.

CRAIG

You're insane.

LESTER

I am not alone. There are others. We

are legion. You will pay for this

blasphemy. You will pay dearly.

MAXINE

Crackpot.

CUT TO:

DISCIPLES OF MALKOVICH

How much do we love you? We loved

you in "Making Mr. Right."  That is

how much we love you. We even own the

director's cut on laser disc. Please

accept us into your head as we have

accepted you into our hearts. Please

let us be you. Amen.

CUT TO:

LESTER

May I have your attention, please.

We have a new disciple among us tonight.

DISCIPLES OF MALKOVICH

Hallelujah.

LESTER

She is the wife of Schwartz.

LOTTE

(apologetically)

I'm getting divorced.

LESTER

No you mustn't, my child.

LOTTE

But why, Son of Malkovich?

LESTER

We need you on the inside, my child.

To report on his comings and goings,

and if need be, to... destroy him...

(hands Lotte a gun)

...for lack of a better word.

CUT TO:

LOTTE

What are you doing?

CRAIG

I'm moving. Remember? What's with

the hooded cloak?

LOTTE

Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been

thinking. Let's try to work this out.

We've got so much history.

CRAIG

(still packing)

You should feed your animals. They're

looking peaked.

LOTTE

I'm getting rid of the fucking

animals.

CRAIG

What?

LOTTE

I'm getting rid of the animals. I've

lost interest. Besides, they're

standing between you and me.

CRAIG

No they're not.

LOTTE

You've always hated the animals.

CRAIG

You've always loved the animals.

LOTTE

I'm giving them up. I've changed.

I've found a new focus.

CRAIG

What's that?

LOTTE

(beat)

Us, of course.

CRAIG

(tenderly)

Oh, Lot...

CRAIG (CONT'D)

What about Maxine?

LOTTE

Fuck Maxine.

CRAIG

We wish.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MAXINE

Yes?

LOTTE (O.S.)

I have to see you. Can you call him

and invite us over?

MAXINE

When?

LOTTE (O.S.)

Give me one hour to get inside him

Exactly.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MAXINE

Thanks so much for coming over.

MALKOVICH

Oh, I'm really glad you called.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MAXINE

So, do you enjoy being an actor?

MALKOVICH

Oh sure. It's very rewarding...

LOTTE (V.O.)

Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.

MAXINE

I love you, Lotte.

LOTTE (V.O.)

Maxine...

MALKOVICH

(stopping)

I'm sorry, did you just call me

"Lotte"?

MAXINE

Do you mind?

MALKOVICH

(thinking)

No, I guess not. I'm an actor.

MAXINE

Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.

MALKOVICH

(thinks he's playing along)

Yes, Maxine, yes.

LOTTE (V.O.)

This is too good to be true.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CRAIG

You were him last night, weren't you?

LOTTE

(quietly)

Yes.

CRAIG

And he was with her.

LOTTE

We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.

CRAIG

We?

LOTTE

Me and John.

CRAIG

Don't forget me.

LOTTE

Well, you have the Maxine action

figure to play with.

LOTTE (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. That was nasty.

CRAIG

Life is confusing, isn't it?

LOTTE

Sometimes we're forced to make

hard decisions.

(beat)

I'd like for us to stay together,

Craig. You know, platonically,

if that's possible. I truly value

our friendship.

CRAIG

I feel that somehow my parents never

prepared me to make this particular

decision. Not that I blame them. How

could they know? Today's world is so

complicated.

(beat)

No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry,

Lotte. I'm so sorry.

CUT TO:

MAXINE

You're late.

CRAIG

Are you torturing me on purpose?

MAXINE

(matter of fact)

I've fallen in love.

CRAIG

I don't think so. I've fallen in

love. This is what people who've

fallen in love look like.

MAXINE

You picked the unrequited variety.

Very bad for the skin.

CRAIG

You're evil, Maxine.

MAXINE

Do you have any idea what its like

to have two people look at you with

total lust and devotion through the

same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose

you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LESTER

(depressing switch)

Yes, my dear?

FLORIS (O.S.)

(intercom voice)

Someone names A Lot of Warts on

line two.

LESTER

Thank you, Floris.

FLORIS (O.S.)

(intercom voice)

Think, Jew florist?

LESTER

(pressing line 2)

Good morning, Lotte!

LOTTE (O.S.)

Dr. Lester, everything's falling

apart.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LOTTE

I blew it, Dr. Lester.

LESTER

You followed your heart, my child,

and that is not necessarily a bad

thing.

LOTTE

But now we've lost access to Craig.

LESTER

(laughs)

My child, I don't think its a great

mystery what Craig's up to.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LOTTE

I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed

to cherish me forever. Now you hold

a gun to my head?

CRAIG

Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.

LOTTE

Suck my dick!

CRAIG

(slapping her)

Shut up!

CRAIG (CONT'D)

Tell her you need to see her.

LOTTE

(to Craig)

You bastard.

MAXINE (V.O.)

J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else

can be.

LOTTE

(looking at Craig)

I have to see you.

MAXINE (V.O.)

Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's

business hours. I need to keep the

membranous tunnel open for paying

customers.

CRAIG

(sotto)

Tell her, what the hell, close

early today, live dangerously.

LOTTE

What the hell, darling. Close early

today, live dangerously.

MAXINE (V.O.)

Oooh, doll. I love this new

devil-may-care side of you. Alrighty,

I'll track down Lover-boy, and I'll

see both of you in one hour.

Exactamundo.

LOTTE

(screaming)

Help! He's locking me in a cage!

NEIGHBOR

Shut up!

PARROT

Shut up!

CRAIG

Lesson number one:  Be careful what

you teach your parrot.

CUT TO:

MALKOVICH

Tommy, can I take fifteen?

CUT TO:

MAXINE

Oh, Lotte... Oh, sweetie...

MALKOVICH

Maxine...

CRAIG (V.O.)

I can't believe it. This is too

good to be true.

CUT TO:

CRAIG

You're glowing again.

MAXINE

A girl has a right to glow if

she wants. It's in the fucking

constitution.

CUT TO:

CRAIG

It was lovely being you being

Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen

the passionate side of sweet Maxine

before, or her actual tits for that

matter. If only, I've been thinking

to myself, if only I could actually

feel what Malkovich feels, rather

than just see what he sees... And

then, dare I say it, if only I could

control his arms, his legs, his

pelvis, and make them do my bidding.

LOTTE

It'll never happen, fuckface.

CRAIG

Ah, but you're forgetting one thing,

Lambchop.

LOTTE

What's that?

CRAIG

I'm a puppeteer.

CUT TO:

MAXINE

Lotte, this is so good...

CRAIG (V.O.)

(tense, commanding)

Move right hand across her left breast

now. Move right hand across her left

breast now. Move right hand across her

left breast now.

CRAIG (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Holy shit, yes!

MALKOVICH

Holy shit, yes!

CRAIG (V.O.)

Holy shit! He said what I said!

MALKOVICH

Holy shit! He said what I said!

MAXINE

Lotte? Is that you?

CRAIG (V.O.)

Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!

MALKOVICH

Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!

(scared)

What the fuck is going on? I'm not

talking. This is not me!

MAXINE

Oh, Lotte...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MALKOVICH

Something was making me talk. Some

Goddamn thing was making me move. I

gotta get out of here.

MAXINE

Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion

for me taking hold.

MALKOVICH

No, Dollface, I know what my passion

taking hold feels like. I gotta go.

CUT TO:

CRAIG

I did it, sweetie. I moved his arm

across your girlfriend's glorious tit.

I made him talk. And, oh, there was

the beginning of sensation in the

fingertips. Ummmm-mmmm! It's just a

matter of practice before Malkovich

becomes nothing more than another

puppet hanging next to my worktable.

Coffee?

CUT TO:

MALKOVICH

It's like nothing I've ever felt

before. I think I'm going crazy.

KEVIN BACON

I'm sure you're not going crazy.

MALKOVICH

Kevin, I'm telling you... it was

like nothing I've...

KEVIN BACON

Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda.

Were you stoned?

MALKOVICH

Yes, but you see, someone else was

talking through my mouth.

KEVIN BACON

You were stoned. Case closed. End

of story. How hot is this babe?

MALKOVICH

I think it might've been this Lotte

woman talking through me. Maxine

likes to call me Lotte.

KEVIN BACON

Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you

to channel some dead lesbian lover.

Let me know when you're done with her.

This is my type of chick.

MALKOVICH

I'm done with her now. Tonight really

creeped me out.

KEVIN BACON

You're crazy to let go of a chick who

calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a

friend.

MALKOVICH

I don't know anything about her. What

if she's some sort of witch or

something?

KEVIN BACON

All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian

Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy.

Ha ha ha.

MALKOVICH

I gotta know the truth, Kevin.

KEVIN BACON

The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MALKOVICH

Excuse me, what type of service does

this company provide?

FAT MAN

You get to be John Malkovich for

fifteen minutes. Two hundred clams.

MALKOVICH

(quietly flipped)

I see.

FAT MAN

No cutting, by the way.

FAT MAN (CONT'D)

No cutting!

CRAIG

Hey! Break it up! Break it up!

Everybody gets a chance to be...

FAT MAN

It's him! Oh, we're so sorry Mr.

Malkovich! I hope me and my

associates from Overeaters Anonymous

didn't hurt you too terribly.

MALKOVICH

(to Craig)

Inside.

CUT TO:

MAXINE

Darling!

MALKOVICH

What the fuck is going on?

CRAIG

Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig

Schwartz. I can explain. We operate

a little business her that...

simulates, for our clientele, the

experience of... being you, actually.

MALKOVICH

Simulates?

CRAIG

Sure, after a fashion.

MALKOVICH

Let me try.

CRAIG

You? Why I'm sure it would pale in

comparison to the actual experience.

MALKOVICH

Let me try!

MAXINE

Let him try.

CRAIG

Of course, right this way, Mr.

Malkovich. Compliments of the house.

MALKOVICH

(repulsed by the slime)

Jesus.

CRAIG

What happens when a man climbs

through his own portal?

MAXINE

(shrugs)

How the hell would I know? I wasn't

a philosophy major.

So how was it?

MALKOVICH

That... was... no... simulation.

CRAIG

I know. I'm sorry...

MALKOVICH

I have been to the dark side. I have

seen a world that no man should ever

see.

CRAIG

Really? For most people it's a rather

pleasant experience. What exactly did

you...

MALKOVICH

This portal is mine and must be sealed

up forever. For the love of God.

CRAIG

With all respect, sir, I discovered

that portal. Its my livelihood.

MALKOVICH

It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see

you in court!

CRAIG

(calling after him)

And who's to say I won't be seeing

what you're seeing... in court?

MOTORIST

Hey, Malkovich! Think fast!

CUT TO:

LOTTE

Once this was a relationship based

on love. Now you have me in a cage

with a monkey and a gun to my head.

CRAIG

Things change. Anyway, you gave up your

claim to that love the first time you

stuck your dick in Maxine.

LOTTE

You fell in love with her first.

CRAIG

Yeah but I didn't do anything about

it. Out of respect for our marriage.

LOTTE

You didn't do anything about it out

of respect for the fact that she

wouldn't let you near her with a ten

foot pole, which is, by the way,

about nine feet, nine inches off

the mark anyway.

CRAIG

(beat)

That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what

have I become? My wife in a cage

with a monkey. A gun in my hand.

Betrayal in my heart.

LOTTE

Maybe this is what you've always

been, Craig, you just never faced

it before.

CRAIG

Perhaps you're right. I can't let

you go though. Too much has happened.

You're my ace in the hole.

LOTTE

I need a shower.

CRAIG

I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm

some kind of monster. I'm the guy

you read about in the paper and go,

"he's some kind of monster."

LOTTE

You're not a monster, Craig. Just

a confused man.

CRAIG

I love you so much.

CRAIG (CONT'D)

But I gotta go now. I've got to go

be Johnny.

MAXINE (O.S.)

J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...

LOTTE

We have to meet.

MAXINE

One hour.

CRAIG

I'll tell you all about it when I

get home.

DISSOLVE TO:

SAFARI MAN

Well, there monkeys ain't going

nowhere. Let's get us a couple a

brews 'fore the boss comes back...

CHIMP ONE (DUBBED VOICE)

Son, untie your mother and me!

Quickly! Before the great bald

chimp-men return.

CHIMP TWO (DUBBED VOICE)

Hurry, Elijah!

SAFARI MAN

Why you little bastard!

DISSOLVE TO:

LOTTE

Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent!

LOTTE

Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me

in John the last three times. Craig's

had me locked up in the apartment. He

made me call you at gunpoint. It's

been him! Oh, God, it's been him!

MAXINE (O.S.)

(beat, calmly)

Really? Well, you know, he's quite

good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have

a session with Malkovich I have to

attend. I'll speak with you soon.

LOTTE

But Maxine, I thought it was me you

loved.

MAXINE (O.S.)

I thought so too, doll. I guess we

were mistaken.

LOTTE

Hello, Dr. Lester?

CUT TO:

MALKOVICH

Come on in.

MAXINE

I can explain about the portal,

darling.

MALKOVICH

Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I

just let you up here to tell you

that, and to tell you that I'm taking

you and Schwartz to court.

MAXINE

Oh shut up.

(beat)

Craig, darling are you in there?

MALKOVICH

Yes. How did you know it was me?

MAXINE

Lotte called me.

MALKOVICH

Oh, so the bitch escaped.

MAXINE

Apparently you can control this

Malkovich fellow now.

MALKOVICH

I'm getting better all the time.

MAXINE

I'll say you are. Let's do it on his

kitchen table, then make him eat an

omelette off of it.

MALKOVICH

(as Malkovich)

No... damn... you...

(as Craig)

Oh shut up, you overrated sack of

shit.

CUT TO:

LESTER

You know I think it pays to leave

juice-making to the trained

professionals. You look terrible,

my dear.

LOTTE

Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr.

Lester.

LESTER

Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must

inform you that I find that highly

arousing.

LOTTE

No, you don't understand. I've been

inside Malkovich when I'm with

Maxine...

LESTER

(slaps Lotte furiously)

What?! That is not allowed. My God,

you are supposed to be one of us.

You know you must never partake of

Malkovich by yourself!

LOTTE

No, I didn't know that.

LESTER

Oh, didn't anyone show you the

indoctrination video?

LOTTE

No.

LESTER

Oh, sorry. Right this way.

CUT TO:

LESTER ON FILM

Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians.

As you may already know, today a

baby was born into this sad world.

LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)

His name is John Horatio Hannibal

Malkovich. And we are the keepers

of the door to his soul. One day,

when his brain is big enough, we

will all journey into his head and

live there for all eternity. Following

the teachings of our leader Karl Marx,

we will build the ultimate communist

community, one body and hundreds,

maybe thousands, of brains inside

working together to form a super

human intellect capable of curing

disease, stopping all war, and

ruling the world with a benevolent

fist. We will take a wife, a woman

of uncommon beauty and intellect, who

is, as yet, still an infant herself.

LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)

Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella

DeMent.

LOTTE

Does Floris know that she's the

chosen?

LESTER

Well, I tried to explain it to her,

but...

CUT TO:

MAXINE

You still there, sweets?

MALKOVICH

Yeah. I've figured out how to hold

on as long as I want. Oddly enough,

it's all in the wrists.

MAXINE

Wow.

(little girl pout)

Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.

MALKOVICH

You mean with Malkovich?

MAXINE

I'd love to see your work.

MALKOVICH

(pleased)

Really? Yeah. Okay.

MALKOVICH (CONT'D)

I'll do something I call "Craig's

Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."

MAXINE

(moved)

That was incredible. You're brilliant!

MALKOVICH

You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing

with dolls.

MAXINE

You're right, my darling, it's

so much more. It's playing with

people!

MAXINE

Stay in him forever?

MALKOVICH

(as Malkovich, screaming)

No!

(as Craig, calmly)

But how will we make a living,

my love, if our clientele doesn't

have access to our product?

MAXINE

Well, we'll have all the money in

Malkovich's bank account, plus he

still gets acting work occasionally.

MALKOVICH

(as Malkovich, breaking through)

No! Please!

(as Craig, to Malkovich)

Shut up, will you? We're trying to

think here.

(to Maxine)

It is sort of like being a puppeteer.

I like that about it.

MAXINE

No one would ever have to know its

not him.

MALKOVICH

(an idea)

Wait a minute! What if everybody knew?

What if we presented Malkovich as the

world's most complicated puppet and

me as the only puppeteer sophisticated

enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor

with the Great Mantini!

MAXINE

Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!

CUT TO:

LOTTE

I have sinned, unwittingly, against

the community. And for this I am

truly sorry.

MAN #2

W-w-what's it like on the inside?

LOTTE

Oh, it's glorious. It's indescribable.

MAN #2

Oooh, I wanna go. I wanna go. I say

it's time.

LESTER

Perhaps you're right, Terry. We're

all prepared, and perhaps this

Schwartz fellow is forcing our hand

a bit. We will enter the portal

tonight!

CUT TO:

MALKOVICH

(Craig to Malkovich)

Shut up!

(to Maxine)

Sorry, dear, I lost control for

a minute.

MAXINE

(kissing him)

It's okay, my sweet.

LESTER

Aaaahhhh, the portal!

LOTTE

(to Malkovich)

You bastard!

LESTER

No! Don't harm the vessel!

LOTTE

It's Craig in there, I can tell.

LESTER

I understand, but we must protect

the vessel at all costs.

(to Malkovich)

Please, Craig, please step aside

and allow us to have what is

rightfully ours.

CRAIG

Squatter's rights, Lester.

MAXINE

Now excuse us, we have an

entertainment legend to create.

LESTER

(to the cult members)

Clear the way for them, my friends.

They will be dealt with in due time.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Now, let's see what we can do to

salvage this portal... for the sake

of all that is good.

CUT TO:

AGENT

Of course, send him right in. Don't

ever keep him waiting again. Do you

understand?

AGENT (CONT'D)

John! Great to see you! Sorry about

the cunt at reception.

MALKOVICH

This is my fiancee Maxine.

AGENT

Great to see you, Maxine. Sorry about

the cunt at reception. Please have a

seat.

AGENT (CONT'D)

Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?

MAXINE

No thanks.

AGENT

(into phone)

Teresa, get me a chicken soup.

(to Malkovich and Maxine)

Chicken soup?

MALKOVICH

I'll get right to the point, Larry.

I'm a puppet now...

AGENT

Okay.

MALKOVICH

I'm being controlled by the world's

greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...

AGENT

(no clue)

Oh yeah, he's good.

MALKOVICH

... and I want to show off his skills

by performing a one-puppet

extravaganza in Reno.

MAXINE

Vegas.

MALKOVICH

Vegas. Can you arrange that?

AGENT

Sure, sure. Just let me make a

couple of calls.

CUT TO:

MAN #2

That's the last of it, boss.

LESTER

Well, let's see what we've got

here.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LESTER (V.O.)

My God, where am I? This seems so

familiar.

LESTER (V.O.)

My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker!

Aaaahhhh! Aaaah!

DIRECTOR

Cut!

LESTER (V.O.)

Oh, I'm just the actor in that

Twilight Zone episode.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LESTER

Thank you all for your efforts,

but I'm afraid we can no longer get

into Malkovich through the portal.

LOTTE

(panicky)

Why not? I need to get in there!

LESTER

I'm not certain, my dear, but I

believe your husband has somehow

psychically diverted the route.

LOTTE

That bastard! I'll gladly dispose

of him in the name of the order, Son

of Malkovich.

LESTER

I'm afraid that no physical harm

must come to him as long as he

inhabits the vessel.

MAN #3

(raises hand)

Oooh, I got an idea! What if we

build another portal to Malkovich,

like around back, and sneak in that

way?

MAN #4

Only Captain Mertin knew how to build

a portal, dummy, and he's dead!

LESTER

Actually, my friends, I suppose its

time I told you, I'm Captain James

Mertin.

LESTER (CONT'D)

You see, Lester is an anagram for

Mertin.

LESTER (CONT'D)

It used to work, I'm sure of it.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Oh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.

MAN #3

How can this be? I thought you were

only one hundred and five years old.

Mertin would have to be...

LESTER

(chuckles amiably)

I'm two hundred and five, truth be

told.

WOMAN #1

(flirtatiously)

You don't look a day over one

hundred and five, Captain. What's

your secret?

LESTER

Lots of carrot juice, little lady.

That, and a deal with the Devil.

MAN #2

So what exactly are you saying? Are

we in cahoots with the Dark Master

here?

LESTER

Surprise.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Wait! It's not that bad! When we get

into Malkovich, we still get to rule

the world, just like I told you. The

only difference is that we rule in the

name of evil, instead of good.

MAN #3

That's the only difference?

LESTER

Absolutely.

LESTER (CONT'D)

So anyway...

LOTTE

Well, I for one, am resigning. I will

not serve evil. I am ashamed of all

of you.

LESTER

My dear, let me assure you that when

we attain power, it will be much more

pleasant for those inside Malkovich,

than for those outside.

LOTTE

I'll take my chances.

LESTER

Anybody else?

WOMAN #1

Do we get to wear a crown?

LESTER

But of course.

WOMAN #1

Count me in.

LESTER

Good. I think its time to beckon

Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us

out of this pickle.

FLIP TO:

FLEMMER

Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest,

I didn't anticipate this.

LESTER

And as I said, sir, we can't very

well exert physical persuasion upon

the sacred vessel Malkovich.

FLEMMER

Right, Lester. I heard you the first

time. I'm not a dummy.

LESTER

Didn't mean to imply that you were,

sir.

FLEMMER

Look, I'm going back to my house

to ponder this. So stay calm and

keep track of Schwartz's comings

and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose

of Schwartz's wife, will you?

(to cultists)

Nice to meet you all.

CUT TO:

LOTTE

Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're

not human. People are treacherous

and greedy and corrupt. I've lost

my heart to two of them and I almost

lost my soul to another. And I'm no

better. Look at the way I keep you,

locked in cages, for my own enjoyment.

Well, I've been in a cage too, my

friends. Literally and figuratively.

So tonight I set you free.

LOTTE (CONT'D)

Good-bye, friends.

LOTTE (CONT'D)

Hello, friend

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LOTTE

They've come to kill me, Elijah. See,

I know too much. I should get the

door. It's impolite to keep death

waiting.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MAXINE

This is it, lover. You're stepping

onto that stage a nobody and

presto-change-o, you're coming

back the greatest puppeteer the

world has ever seen.

MALKOVICH

I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting

me hard today.

MAXINE

Doesn't he know how important

tonight is to us?

MALKOVICH

He's a selfish bastard.

CUT TO:

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

Ladies and gentlemen, it is the

great privilege of the Luxor hotel

and Casino to present Craig Schwartz

and his magical puppet John

Malkovich.

LESTER

Blasphemous bastard.

LESTER (CONT'D)

(grudgingly)

Pretty good though.

USHER

Oh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting

you tonight, sir. Um, I'm afraid

there's not an empty seat in the

entire house.

MANTINI

(not taking his eyes from the stage)

Make one empty.

USHER

Y-y-y-es sir.

LESTER

Not too shabby.

MANTINI

Nothing more than a Goddamn clown.

CUT TO:

LOTTE

They're going to take over the

world, Elijah. Evil will reign.

But, then, evil already reigns,

doesn't it? So what difference

does it make if John Malkovich

is wearing the fucking crown while

it's reigning?

CUT TO:

FLEMMER

It's open.

LESTER

It's just me, boss. I brought

croissants.

FLEMMER

Have a seat. I wracking my brain

over this Malkovich thing.

LESTER

We saw his show at the Luxor last

night.

FLEMMER

(impressed)

Vegas? What'd you think?

LESTER

The kid's got talent. You've never

seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz

had him up there singing and dancing.

Impressions.

FLEMMER

Impressions? Those are hard.

LESTER

Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad

we can't kill him.

FLEMMER

I suppose I could come to him in a

dream. I don't know. That's the best

I can think of right now.

LESTER

A scary dream?

FLEMMER

No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary

dream.

LESTER

(noncommittally)

I like that.

CUT TO:

MALKOVICH

They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz

is fantastic!"  The New York Times.

"If only Craig Schwartz had always

been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear

Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's

greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder,

WBAI Radio.

MAXINE

Oh, darling. It's a dream come true.

We're going to ride this straight to

the top.

MALKOVICH

Sleepy suddenly.

MAXINE

Busy day, my little fire chief. Why

don't you climb into bed, and I'll

meet you there in just...

DISSOLVE TO:

CRAIG

Who are you?

FLEMMER

I am the Devil.

CRAIG

Oh.

FLEMMER

Leave Malkovich. He is mine.

CRAIG

Okay. Sorry. I didn't know.

CUT TO:

MAXINE

Bad dream, darling?

MALKOVICH

I've got to leave Malkovich.

MAXINE

You've got to be kidding.

MALKOVICH

I just had the most horrifying

nightmare. The devil was in it.

MAXINE

Malkovich is our meal ticket. You

can't back out because of some

stupid dream.

FLEMMER

(to himself)

Shit.

MALKOVICH

Honey, we can be happy and poor

together.

MAXINE

(laughs derisively)

Perhaps you'll want to consult that

Ouija board again.

MAXINE (CONT'D)

Yeah what?!

MALKOVICH

Derek Mantini!

MANTINI

(still eyeing Maxine)

Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.

MALKOVICH

Did you see the reviews?

MANTINI

Yeah, I saw them

MALKOVICH

Because if you missed any, I just

happen to have copies here you can

take with you when you leave now.

MAXINE

I'm Maxine. I produced the evening

with Malkovich.

MANTINI

Very impressive. I could use a

producer with your vision. And

other outstanding attributes.

MALKOVICH

She's not available.

MANTINI

We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

MAXINE

Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

MANTINI

I won't waste your time Schwartz, or

more importantly, mine. Here's my

proposal: There's only room in this

world for one "World's Greatest

Puppeteer."  Correct? So let's allow

the puppet-going public to crown

their king.

MALKOVICH

How do we do that?

MANTINI

A friendly competition, if you will.

Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S.

Truman puppet appear opposite each

other in a play. Not some Vegas

Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play

that requires actual acting. The

audience decides who is more deserving

of the title. The losing puppeteer

bows out graciously. Goes back to

obscurity as a file clerk.

MALKOVICH

What's the play?

MANTINI

Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.

MALKOVICH

Never heard of it.

MANTINI

Broadway's finest three hours. It's

about the suppression of the

individual. Conformity as God in

modern society.

MALKOVICH

Sounds boring. Are there any songs?

MANTINI

Nothing but acting to hide behind,

buddy-boy.

MALKOVICH

I'm not afraid. I toured for a year

with the National Puppet Company's

production of "Long Day's Journey

Into Night."

MANTINI

Great then.

MALKOVICH

Is there dancing?

MANTINI

No.

MALKOVICH

Who needs dancing?

CUT TO:

LESTER

How'd it go? Did you say the

philodendron gets water or no?

FLEMMER

No, for God's sake, I just watered

it yesterday.

(beat)

It almost went well. I gave a pretty

good dream, but circumstances arose.

LESTER

What kind of circumstances?

FLEMMER

Maxine says she'll leave him if he

leaves Malkovich, plus he's been

challenged to a puppet-duel by

Mantini.

LESTER

The Great Mantini?

FLEMMER

No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course

the Great Mantini!

LESTER

Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I

saw him do "Tru" with his sixty

foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.

FLEMMER

But I think I have another plan.

LESTER

(snippy)

Do tell. I love a good plan.

FLEMMER

Why are you being like this?

LESTER

I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me

the plan.

FLEMMER

Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will

leave Malkovich, right? So, if he

needs it, I help Mantini's performance

a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the

show.

LESTER

Can you do that? I mean, do you know

anything about puppetry?

FLEMMER

I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can

handle it.

LESTER

I was just asking. No disrespect

intended.

FLEMMER

Fine. Let's drop it.

LESTER

Fine. I mean, it's not like I was

doubting you, it's just that I know

puppetry is a skill that takes a long

time to acquire.

FLEMMER

Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.

LESTER

Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen

table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a

letter from Alex Trebek.

CUT TO:

ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)

You've got to tell Craig what's going

on. He must never leave Malkovich.

LOTTE

I'm glad you learned sign language,

Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging.

I'm tired of this conversation. I'm

tired period. What has the world ever

done for me that I should feel

personally responsible for saving it?

ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)

It is better to light one candle than

curse the darkness. I learned that

from you.

LOTTE

What have I become?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET

Do you dream often?

MALKOVICH

Do you?

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET

It's my job to ask the questions.

Yours to answer them.

MALKOVICH

Says who?

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET

Says me. Do you dream often?

MALKOVICH

Do you?

CUT TO:

MAXINE

(without turning around)

Keep your eyes in your pants, old

timer.

CUT TO:

THEATERGOER #1

That Truman puppet is downright

boring as the psychiatrist.

THEATERGOER #2

It's a wooden performance, really.

Get it? Wooden?

THEATERGOER #3

What's with the Malkovich puppet?

He was much better in Vegas when he

played the piano with his feet.

THEATERGOER #4

I hate it when they try to stretch.

It's like Woody Allen.

THEATERGOER #5

They both stink! I'm going across the

street to second act Miss Saigon.

CUT TO:

MAXINE

You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics,

lover, 'cause right now you're running

neck and neck with the dead president.

And you're both in last place.

CUT TO:

CHARLES NELSON REILLY

You're doing beautifully, my boy. I

wept at the speech about your wife.

CHARLES NELSON REILLY

What the hell? Nyong-nyong!

CUT TO:

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET

I can hear the creature's voice. It's

calling me out of the black cave of

the Psyche. I shove in my dim little

torch, and there he stands -- waiting

for me. He raises his matted head. He

opens his great, square teeth and says

(mocking)

'Why? ... Why me? ... Why --

ultimately -- Me? ... Do you really

imagine you can account for Me?

Totally, infallibly, inevitably

account for Me? ... Poor Dr. Dysart!'

DISSOLVE TO:

MALKOVICH

Eyes! ... White eyes -- never closed!

Eyes like flames -- coming -- coming!

... God seest! ... God seest! ... NO!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET

Here ... Here ... Sssh ... Sssh ...

Calm now ... Lie back. Just lie back!

Now breathe in deep. Very deep. In ...

Out ... In ... Out ... That's it ...

In. Out .. In ... Out ...

AUDIENCE MEMBER

(to his wife)

That Malkovich puppet is a damn fine

actor.

FLEMMER

(blood boiling)

Bastard is stealing my thunder.

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET

All right! I'll take it away! He'll be

delivered from madness. What then?

He'll feel himself acceptable! What

then?

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)

I'll heal the rash on his body. I'll

erase the welts cut into his body by

flying manes.

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)

You won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses

will be quite safe. You'll save your

pennies every week, till you can

change that scooter into a car...

ACTUAL TRUMAN

Where am I? Aren't I dead?

(possessed)

Vote for Mantini!

CUT TO:

MALKOVICH

Good-bye, Maxine.

MAXINE

Whatever.

MALKOVICH

(weak but relieved)

I'm back! My nightmare is over.

CUT TO:

FLEMMER

(into walkie-talkie)

Okay, now!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MALKOVICH

(now sounding like fifty voices)

I am your earthly king! Kneel before

me!

CROWD

(like automatons)

Hail Malkovich, king of the damned.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MALKOVICH

(fifty voices)

Greetings, my lowly subjects.

FLORIS

Great things, my lonely subtext?

MALKOVICH

(rolls his eyes)

Boy, be careful what you wish for.

(to Floris)

Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride,

will you?

MALKOVICH (CONT'D)

(to the people on the street)

I am bored. You will dance for your

king now.

MALKOVICH (CONT'D)

Faster! Faster, my little trained

monkeys!

CUT TO:

ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)

Must you take this terrible demon

on yourself, my love?

LOTTE

Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter

Malkovich and destroy him from the

inside. If not me, who?

ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)

If there was any way I could go in

your place. But I'm only a monkey

and...

LOTTE

(puts finger to his lips)

Hush, sweetheart.

LOTTE

(to the animals)

I'll be with you always, my friends.

Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll

rejoin you with wings and a beak.

ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)

Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings

and a halo.

PARROT

(softly)

Good-bye. Good-bye.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LOTTE

My God!

CRAIG

I'm so glad you're safe. You look

really wonderful.

LOTTE

I'm in love. For the first time.

It's funny, but when it happens to

you, there's no question.

CRAIG

He's a lucky man.

(beat)

Do I know him?

LOTTE

It's Elijah.

CRAIG

The iguana?

LOTTE

The monkey.

CRAIG

Oh, right. As long as you're happy.

I'm sure he's a better lover than I

ever was.

LOTTE

A better friend.

CRAIG

(beat)

I'm sorry for everything.

LOTTE

(pecking him on the cheek)

It's okay, Craig. It all worked out,

in an odd sort of way.

CRAIG

You came up here looking for the

portal?

LOTTE

Yeah. I was going to kill him from

the inside.

CRAIG

And yourself too in the process. God,

you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I

see that before?

LOTTE

You saw it once. Now you see it again.

That's life, isn't it? And you were

up here to try the same thing, weren't

you?

CRAIG

I suppose. But they got here first,

the lousy bastards. So now it's all

over, I guess.

LOTTE

I don't know. There's a small

community of us. We have a place they

don't know about. We're happy. We'll

keep trying to figure out a way. Come

stay with us. Join the struggle.

CRAIG

You'll have me, after all I've done

to you?

LOTTE

People make mistakes.

CRAIG

I'm through with puppets, Lotte.

I just want you to know that.

LOTTE

I know.

CRAIG

I'd like to be a farmer. I want to

help things grow, to encourage life.

Do you and your friends need a farmer?

LOTTE

Sure. We could really use a farmer.

We'd be grateful for the help.

(beat)

Also, I think, you know, if you

wouldn't mind too terribly, a little

puppet show every once in a while,

would do a lot to lift our spirits.

You know, if you wouldn't mind too

terribly.

LOTTE (CONT'D)

Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.

CRAIG

I love you, Lotte.

MANTINI

(in Craig's voice)

I can't wait to see where you and your

friends live, Lotte.
