SHOOTING DRAFT

HASTINGS

(almost inaudible, as

if to himself)

Stopping...?

CONDUCTOR

(softly, staring at

the towns people)

Man. They look woebegone and far

away.

MACREEDY

(looking around)

I'll only be here twenty-four hours.

CONDUCTOR

In a place like this, it could be a

lifetime.

(turning to face

Macreedy)

Good luck, Mr. Macreedy.

HASTINGS

You for Black Rock?

MACREEDY

(easily)

That's right.

HASTINGS

(uneasily)

There must be some mistake. I'm

Hastings, the telegraph agent. Nobody

told me the train was stopping.

MACREEDY

(with a ghost of a

grin)

They didn't?

HASTINGS

(upset)

I just said they didn't, and they

ought to. What I -- want to know,

why didn't they?

MACREEDY

(shrugging)

Probably didn't think it was

important.

HASTINGS

Important?! It's the first time the

streamliner stopped here in four

years.

(swallowing nervously)

You being met? You visiting folks or

something? I mean, whatd'ya want?

MACREEDY

I want to go to Adobe Flat. Any cabs

available?

HASTINGS

(as if he hadn't heard

right; as if he wanted

everyone in town to

know)

Adobe Flat?!

(he gulps, recovers

slightly)

No cabs.

MACREEDY

Where's the hotel?

MACREEDY

(patiently)

I asked where's the hotel?

MACREEDY

Thanks.

HASTINGS

(into mouthpiece)

Hello, Pete? Now, listen...

MACREEDY

(slowing up)

'Afternoon.

COLEY

(blocking doorway)

Anything I can do for you?

MACREEDY

You run this hotel?

COLEY

No.

MACREEDY

(pleasantly)

Then there's nothing you can do for

me.

HECTOR

(turning to Coley)

Find Smith!

"GOD BLESS AMERICA"

MACREEDY

(pleasantly)

I'd like a room.

PETE

All filled up.

MACREEDY

(a beat)

Got any idea where I might --

PETE

(stiffly, shaking his

head)

This is 1945, mister. There's been a

war on.

MACREEDY

I thought it ended a couple of months

ago.

PETE

Yeah, but the O.P.A. lingers on.

PETE

You don't know about the O.P.A...

MACREEDY

(without looking up)

Tell me.

PETE

Well, for establishments with less'n

fifty rooms hotel keepers got to

report regularly about...

PETE

...about tenants and... and...

registration...

(drawing himself up)

There are penalties imposed...

MACREEDY

(eyes still on the

ledger)

You seem to have lots of vacancies.

PETE

(uncomfortable)

Well... as I said...

MACREEDY

Lots of vacancies.

PETE

They're everyone of 'em locked up.

Some are show rooms...

MACREEDY

Yes...?

PETE

(with touching

sincerity)

...for cattle buyers, feed salesmen.

The others -- they're spoken for,

rented to cowboys, ranch hands...

(Macreedy listens

respectfully)

They pay by the month. For when they

come into town. We provide for their

every wish and comfort.

(weakly)

You understand...?

MACREEDY

Not really. But while I'm pondering

it, get a room ready. Just for

tonight.

(picking key from

rack at random)

This one.

MACREEDY

(signing)

Sure could use a bath. Where is it?

PETE

Head of the stairs.

MACREEDY

I don't know just why you're

interested -- but the name's Macreedy.

I'm...

(grins)

It's all in the ledger.

HECTOR

(slowly, his eyes

glued to Macreedy's

stiff arm)

You look like you need a hand.

HECTOR

(reading aloud)

John J. Macreedy. From Los Angeles.

(looking up)

I wanna know everything he does,

Pete. Check every call -- any mail.

PETE

(nodding)

And in the meantime...?

HECTOR

(grinning harshly)

In the meantime, I'll crowd him a

little...

(looking up the stairs)

...see if he's got any iron in his

blood...

DISSOLVE:

MACREEDY

(slightly amused)

I think you have the wrong room.

HECTOR

(not budging)

You think so?

HECTOR

What else you got on your mind?

MACREEDY

Nothing, I guess.

HECTOR

If you had a mind, boy, you'd of

heard what Pete downstairs said. He

said these here rooms are for us

cowboys. For our every wish and

comfort.

MACREEDY

And this, I guess, is yours?

HECTOR

When I'm in town. And I'm in town,

as any fool can see. You see that,

don't you, boy?

MACREEDY

I guess I do. Would you mind very

much if I sort of...

(he gestures toward

his suitcase and

clothing)

...clean up this mess and get another

room?

HECTOR

Not at all. But if you want this

room real bad...

(he raises his enormous

bulk to a sitting

position, rubbing

the knuckles of one

big fist with the

palm of his other

hand)

...we could maybe settle your claim

without all this talk.

(no answer from

Macreedy)

If a man don't claim what's rightfully

his'n, he's nuthin'. What do you

think?

MACREEDY

I guess so.

HECTOR

You guess so. But still you ain't

claimin' this room?

MACREEDY

I guess not.

HECTOR

You're all the time guessin', boy.

Don't you ever know anything?

MACREEDY

One thing I know. Since I got off

the train, I've been needled. Why?

HECTOR

(after a beat, slowly)

I guess I don't rightly know.

DISSOLVE TO:

DOC

(straight)

Who?

SAM

(irritated)

You know who!

(Doc grins impishly;

Sam's anger subsides)

What do you think, Doc?

DOC

Why ask me? He's no salesman, that's

sure.

(again the impish

grin)

Unless he's peddling dynamite.

SAM

(squirming visibly)

Maybe he's a cop, or something...

DOC

Ever see a cop with a stiff arm?

SAM

(squinting thoughtfully)

Maybe his arm's all right. Maybe

he's just holding tight to something

in his pocket...

DOC

(scoffing)

Like what? A pistol? A stick of T-N-

T?

(gleefully)

To blow up this whole mangy, miserable

town!

(with sudden, almost

naive, seriousness)

Why are you so interested, Sam?

SAM

Who, me?

DOC

I mean, if I was that interested...

(his eyes look up

toward the hotel

stairs o.s.)

...I'd ask him.

MACREEDY

Hey! Hold it!

MACREEDY

Got any cigarettes?

PETE

This is all.

PETE

How long you staying?

MACREEDY

In my new room, you mean?

(flatly)

I'm staying.

PETE

I mean, in the hotel.

MACREEDY

Just about twenty-four hours.

(sharply)

Why?

PETE

(flustered)

I... I was just askin'.

MACREEDY

(evenly)

Why? You expecting a convention?

PETE

(doggedly)

I was just askin'.

MACREEDY

Stale.

MACREEDY

Where can I rent a car?

PETE

I don't know.

MACREEDY

(as to a child)

Let's put it this way -- if I had a

car and if I wanted to put gas in

it, where would I go?

PETE

(refusing to cooperate)

But you don't have a car.

DOC

(to Macreedy)

You might try the garage at the end

of the street.

MACREEDY

Thanks.

MACREEDY

(grinning wearily at

Coley)

Here we go again.

PETE

(deferentially,

gesturing toward the

open register)

That's all I know about him, Mr.

Smith.

SMITH

(to Coley's back)

Sit down.

COLEY

(spinning to face him)

I was only...

SMITH

(interrupting)

Sit down.

HECTOR

(after a pause)

Pretty cool guy.

SMITH

Doesn't push easy?

HECTOR

(frowning)

That's it -- that's just it. He pushes

too easy. Maybe we oughtta...

SMITH

What do you want, Doc?

DOC

Nothing.

(archly)

I was just wondering what all you

people were worrying about.

(Smith looks at him

coldly)

Not that I have the slightest idea.

SMITH

You wonder too much, and you talk

too much.

(pauses)

It's a bad parlay, Doc.

DOC

I hold no truck with silence.

(impishly)

I got nothing to hide.

HECTOR

(suddenly towering

over Doc)

What're you tryin' to say?

DOC

Nothing, man. It's just, you worry

about the stranger only if you look

at him...

(slowly)

...from a certain aspect.

SMITH

How do you look at him, Doc?

DOC

(firmly)

With the innocence of a fresh-laid

egg.

SMITH

(after a pause)

Keep it up, Doc. Be funny. Make bad

jokes.

(he starts to walk

toward the window,

Doc and Hector

following him)

And some day I'll have Coley wash

out your mouth with lye.

MACREEDY

Hi, T.J.

MACREEDY

This your garage?

T.J.

Nope.

MACREEDY

(a beat)

Where's the man it belongs to?

T.J.

Ain't a man.

T.J.

Lady runs this garage.

T.J.

She's not here.

MACREEDY

Where'd she go?

T.J.

(shrugging)

I dunno. Somewhere.

MACREEDY

When will she be back?

T.J.

I dunno. Sometime.

T.J.

In about ten minutes.

MACREEDY

(with a grin)

Thanks.

HASTINGS

I called the Circle T. He ain't got

business there -- not if they don't

know him. Right, Mr. Smith?

SMITH

(to Hastings)

Send a wire to Nick Gandi in Los

Angeles. Tell him to find out all he

can about John J. Macreedy. Tell him

I want to know fast. Sign my name.

HASTINGS

What was that?

SMITH

Nick Gandi. G-A-N-D-I. Care of the

Blake Hotel.

COLEY

(after a beat)

Who's Gandi?

SMITH

He's a private detective.

(beat)

I drive to L.A. now and then.

HECTOR

(slightly worried)

He'll get us the dope?

SMITH

He'll get us anything, for twenty

bucks a day and expenses.

(Hector frowns)

Hector, you worry too fast and too

easy.

HECTOR

It's just, I don't like it.

COLEY

Maybe he's just passing through.

HECTOR

Don't bet on it. He can only mean

trouble.

SMITH

(smiles faintly)

Hector, you're jumpy as a stall horse.

HECTOR

(doggedly)

We oughtta see him... talk to him.

SMITH

(quietly)

About what?

(Hector doesn't answer)

What'll we talk to him about? The

birds, the bees? The weather? The

crops?

(pauses)

You tried -- where'd it get you?

HECTOR

(uncomfortably)

I only thought...

SMITH

Sure. You only thought.

COLEY

(after a beat)

What do we do?

SMITH

What do you do? You wait. Like Pete

here. Right, Pete?

SMITH

That's all you do. But while you

wait... I talk to him.

DOC

(o.s.)

Hey!

DOC

Now what do you know?

(beaming)

Mr. Macreedy seems to be heading for

the jail.

(impishly)

Now what do you suppose he'd want to

see the Sheriff about?

TIM

Hold it, friend.

TIM

(grinning)

I ain't hankerin' to get locked in

my own jail.

MACREEDY

Sorry. I thought you were a guest.

TIM

As it happens, I'm the host.

TIM

Snort?

MACREEDY

No, thanks.

TIM

Don't blame you. It's awful.

TIM

(suddenly mean)

What're you lookin' at?

MACREEDY

(easy)

You tell me.

TIM

(after a beat, relaxing)

I ain't always this bad -- just that

last night me and my pal Doc Velie,

we did a little celebratin'. At least

I did.

MACREEDY

What were you celebrating?

TIM

(shrugs)

You name it.

(studies Macreedy)

What do you want?

MACREEDY

My name's Macreedy. I came in on the

Streamliner.

TIM

You what?

MACREEDY

I said I came in...

TIM

(interrupting)

You ain't from around here. Up Tucson

way -- Phoenix? Mesa? You ain't

sellin' cattle nor seed nor nothin'

like that?

MACREEDY

No.

(sighs, then distinctly

as to a child)

All I want from you is a little

information. I've got to get to a

place called Adobe Flat.

TIM

(reacts; then, tight-

lipped)

This ain't no information bureau.

MACREEDY

One thing about Black Rock --

everybody's polite. Makes for gracious

living.

TIM

Nobody asked you here.

MACREEDY

How do you know?

(he moves toward the

door, with a rueful

grin)

TIM

(starting after him)

What about Adobe Flat?

MACREEDY

I'm looking for a man named Komako.

MACREEDY

Almost a disaster.

TIM

(sinking back in his

chair)

A fate worse'n death.

(he takes the bottle

from Macreedy)

You move fast for a crip... for a

big man.

MACREEDY

What about Komako?

TIM

(slowly)

If there's no further questions...

SMITH

(o.s.)

Mr. Macreedy.

MACREEDY

That's the friendliest word I've

heard since I got here.

SMITH

(grins boyishly)

My name is Smith. I own the Triple-

Bar ranch.

(holds out his hand;

Macreedy shakes it)

I want to apologize for some of the

folks in town.

MACREEDY

They act like they're sitting on a

keg.

SMITH

A keg...? Of what?

MACREEDY

I don't know. Maybe diamonds. Maybe

gunpowder.

SMITH

(disarmingly)

No. Nothing like that. We're a little

suspicious of strangers is all.

Hangover from the old days. The old

West.

MACREEDY

I thought the tradition of the old

West was hospitality.

SMITH

(with a sincere smile)

I'm trying to be hospitable, Mr.

Macreedy.

(boyishly pushes his

dusty cap back on

his head)

Going to be around for a while?

MACREEDY

Could be.

SMITH

How would you like to go hunting

tomorrow? I'd be proud to have you

as my guest.

MACREEDY

Thanks, but I'm afraid not.

SMITH

(with admirable candor)

You mean, because of your arm?

(slaps Macreedy's

shoulder in a

friendly,

understanding gesture)

I knew a man once, lost an arm in a

threshing accident. Used to hunt all

the time.

(almost too blandly)

But he was quite a man. He...

(pauses; then, with

discreet and charming

gravity)

I'm sorry. I... What I mean is -- if

there's anything I can do while you're

around...

MACREEDY

I'm looking for...

(sighs)

Never mind. Thanks, anyway.

SMITH

(quietly)

You're looking for what, Mr. Macreedy?

MACREEDY

(eyeing him)

A man named Komako.

SMITH

(no hesitation)

Komako -- Sure, I remember him --

Japanese farmer. Never had a chance.

MACREEDY

No?

SMITH

He got here in '41 -- just before

Pearl Harbor. Three months later he

was shipped to one of those relocation

centers.

(shaking his head)

Tough.

MACREEDY

Which one did he go to?

SMITH

Who knows?

MACREEDY

You think maybe if I wrote him, the

letter would be forwarded?

SMITH

I'm sure it would. Write your letter.

I'll see it gets out tonight.

MACREEDY

It wouldn't be too much trouble?

SMITH

No trouble at all.

MACREEDY

Funny. Because I think it would be a

great deal of trouble for you. It's

been a great deal of trouble for me.

MACREEDY

I wrote these letters to Komako.

They weren't forwarded. They were

returned -- address unknown.

(he smiles grimly at

Smith)

So I guess there's nothing you can

do for me, after all.

MACREEDY

(going to her)

Need a little help?

LIZ

I can manage.

MACREEDY

Well, I need a little help.

(she looks at him

questioningly)

I'd like to rent your jeep.

LIZ

It'll be two dollars an hour, gas

extra, and ten dollars for my time.

SMITH

(to Liz)

Aren't you going to ask him where he

wants to go?

SMITH

He wants to go to Adobe Flat.

MACREEDY

The road's marked?

LIZ

(nodding)

Yeah. It's about six -- seven miles

down...

MACREEDY

Then I won't need your time.

LIZ

(uneasily)

I thought you might... need a little

help.

MACREEDY

I can manage.

SMITH

Liz. Do you have a license to rent

cars? You could get into trouble.

MACREEDY

It's all right. I won't mention it

to the Sheriff.

SMITH

(slowly)

You shouldn't have done that.

LIZ

I thought it would be better if he

went out there and got done with it.

(Smith looks at her

sharply)

I mean, what could he find out?

SMITH

(as he studies it)

This is liable to be the hardest ten

dollars you ever earned in your life.

QUICK DISSOLVE:

SMITH

(after a beat,

disinterestedly)

What did he want -- the stranger?

TIM

(abstractedly)

He asked about Komako.

(looking up at Smith)

You think he'll kick up a storm?

SMITH

(easily)

A storm? About what?

TIM

I don't know. All I know, I don't

want trouble around here.

(pauses awkwardly,

then)

Never again.

SMITH

Trouble? You don't know anything

about Komako, now do you, Tim?

TIM

I do not. That's the point.

SMITH

The point is, what you don't know

can't hurt you.

TIM

Maybe there's something I ought to

know. Maybe I ought to ask you...

before the stranger comes back and

starts breathing down my neck.

SMITH

(a faint smile)

Tim, you're a lost ball in the high

weeds. I told you a long time ago,

nothing happened for you to worry

about.

TIM

(stands up, facing

Smith)

Thing is, I do worry. Maybe I ain't

much else, but I'm sure a worrier.

(beat, then with soft

emphasis)

And I'm still the law.

SMITH

Then do your job, Tim.

TIM

What is my job, Mr. Smith? Maybe I'd

better find out before Macreedy does

it for me.

SMITH

(evenly)

Macreedy'll do nothing, Tim. And

neither will you.

TIM

Suppose I decide to try?

SMITH

That would be dangerous. You got the

body of a hippo, Tim, but the brain

of a rabbit. Don't overtax it.

TIM

(lowering his eyes,

mumbling)

Yes, Mr. Smith.

HECTOR

(to Smith)

From L.A.?

HASTINGS

Yeah! From that private detective!

HECTOR

(to Smith)

What does he say? Who is this guy?

HASTINGS

Never heard of him, that's what he

says! He checked and there's no John

J. Macreedy. No listing -- no record --

no information. Nothing.

PETE

(quietly, after a

beat, to Smith)

Where does that leave us?

COLEY

I'll tell you where...

SMITH

Shut up!

SMITH

(turning to Coley)

Now, Coley...?

COLEY

(takes a breath, then)

I think Macreedy's a nothing. A

nobody.

SMITH

Is he?

COLEY

So there's nothing to worry about.

SMITH

Isn't there?

(a beat)

You got brains, you have.

COLEY

(squirming)

But what can he find out? That Komako

was...?

(Smith glares at him)

Suppose he finds out?

SMITH

A nobody like Macreedy can raise a

pretty big stink. The point is...

who would miss a nobody like Macreedy

if he just, say, disappeared? Who,

Coley?

SMITH

(exasperated)

Coley!

COLEY

(galvanized from the

rail)

Huh?

PETE

Why don't we wait...

SMITH

Wait for what?

PETE

I mean, maybe he won't find anything.

Maybe he'll just go away.

SMITH

Not Macreedy. I know those maimed

guys. Their minds get twisted. They

put on hair shirts and act like

martyrs. They're all of 'em do-

gooders, trouble makers, freaks.

PETE

But there's no danger yet. Let's

wait and see.

SMITH

(interrupting,

appealing to Coley

as an equal)

No danger, he says. This guy's like

a carrier of small pox. Since he

arrives, there's been a fever in

this town, an infection. And it's

spreading.

(he glances from Coley

to Pete)

Hastings has been in a sick sweat,

running around, shooting off his

face. Doc, for the first time in

four years, gets snotty with me.

Liz...

(to Pete)

...your own sister -- acts like a

fool.

PETE

(hotly)

She's just a kid.

SMITH

(scoffing)

Kid! She must have strained every

muscle in her head to get so stupid!

Renting him a jeep! And Tim -- Tim,

the rum-dum. Tim suddenly decides

he's gotta act like a Sheriff.

(to Coley, gesturing

at Pete)

And he says what's the danger.

SMITH

(easily)

Of course, if you want to take the

chance...

COLEY

(grimly)

Not me.

SMITH

All right, then...

PETE

It's not all right! You're so mighty

quick to kill -- he's not an animal!

SMITH

(to Coley, with mock

surprise)

Well, listen to little spitfire...

(turning slowly on

Pete)

You sniveling toad! I'm saving your

neck! If I don't, who will?

PETE

(squirming)

All I said...

SMITH

Who will?! Doc? Tim? Your sister,

with the rocks in her head?

SMITH

One thing about your sister -- she's

got twice the guts you have. You're

only fit for running away.

COLEY

It's too late for that.

(belligerently, slowly,

at Pete)

He's in this, and he ain't running

no place.

SMITH

(finally)

All right, then...

TIM

Let Smith find himself a new boy. I

can't take it another day.

(pauses, looks at Doc)

If you're a sheriff, they gotta

respect you, otherwise you can't do

your job.

(shakes his head)

They just laugh.

DOC

I don't laugh, Tim.

TIM

Why don't you?

DOC

Cut it out, Tim.

TIM

You should!

DOC

In the name of well-adjusted manhood,

snap out of it. You're going to get

a complex or something.

TIM

Four years ago if I'd of done my

job... if I'd of checked up and found

out what happened. But I didn't!

Just like Smith figured.

DOC

What could you have found out? They

told you a story. You had to believe

it.

TIM

Do you believe it?

TIM

Do you know what happened?

DOC

I don't know.

(ironically)

I lead a quiet, contemplative life.

TIM

Me, I didn't even try to find out.

(a beat)

Don't you understand?

(he taps the badge on

his chest)

When you wear that badge, you're the

Law. And when something happens,

against the Law, you're supposed to

do something about it. It's your

job.

(simply)

Me... I did nothin'. And that's what's

eatin' me. What kind of prescription

you got for that?

DOC

I don't know. I've never been able

to find one for myself.

DOC

Only one thing -- don't quit, Tim.

TIM

Why not?

DOC

Maybe this feller Macreedy has the

prescription.

DISSOLVE:

COLEY

Well, if it's not Macreedy - the

world's champion road hog.

MACREEDY

Yeah. It's a small world.

COLEY

But such an unfriendly one. Now why

did you want to crowd me off the

road?

MACREEDY

(with a slow grin)

I'm kind of sorry if I've incurred

your displeasure.

COLEY

Look what you did to my car.

MACREEDY

If there's anything I can do to make

up for it...

COLEY

You ought to be careful, man -- all

that one-arm driving.

MACREEDY

I'd be glad to pay the damages.

COLEY

It's a threat to life and limb.

MACREEDY

Fortunately no one was hurt.

COLEY

You could get yourself killed that

way -- nosin' all over the

countryside.

MACREEDY

That's the real danger, I can see

that.

COLEY

Why that's pretty smart of you. How

long you intend to keep it up?

MACREEDY

I'm getting out of here, right now.

MACREEDY

(to Pete)

Still expecting that convention?

PETE

(looking up)

What...?

MACREEDY

If you're expecting any extra cowboys,

my room is available.

PETE

You're checking out?

MACREEDY

(nodding)

Is there a train through here tonight?

PETE

Nothing till tomorrow morning. The

streamliner.

MACREEDY

I know that. How about freights?

(Pete shakes his head)

Milk train?

PETE

Tomorrow. After the streamliner.

MACREEDY

Busses?

PETE

Closest stop is Sand City -- thirty-

two miles away.

(a beat)

You're in such a hurry, you should

have never got off here.

MACREEDY

I'm inclined to agree with you.

MACREEDY

Anybody home?

LIZ

(o.s.)

If you're looking for the jeep key...

LIZ

...it's not there...

MACREEDY

(after a beat)

In that case, where do you suggest I

look?

LIZ

(over her shoulders)

The jeep's not for rent.

MACREEDY

It was, just a few hours ago.

LIZ

(flatly)

Things change.

MACREEDY

(with grim amusement)

Sure. And Smith is the kid who changes

'em.

MACREEDY

Miss Brooks.

(softly)

What's the matter with this town of

yours?

LIZ

Nothing. It's none of your concern.

MACREEDY

Then why are they all so concerned

about me?

LIZ

Am I concerned?

MACREEDY

No, you're not. But...

LIZ

But what?

MACREEDY

(easily)

But it strikes me you're a little

too unconcerned. So unconcerned you

won't even rent me a jeep.

LIZ

(flaring)

I don't run a taxi service. I don't

have a license.

MACREEDY

I wish others in this town were as

scrupulously devoted to law and order

as you are.

LIZ

(hotly)

Why don't you lay off! If you don't

like it here, go back where you came

from!

MACREEDY

Funny thing. They try to kill me,

and you feel persecuted.

LIZ

I don't want to get involved.

MACREEDY

Involved in what?

LIZ

(retreating)

Whatever you're up to. Whatever

happens, I've got to go on living

here. These people are my neighbors,

my friends.

MACREEDY

All of them?

LIZ

(slowly)

This is my town, Mr. Macreedy, like

it or not. Whatever happened here,

it was long ago, now it's... it's...

MACREEDY

(evenly)

Dead and buried?

(a beat)

Whatever did happen, you don't seem

to like it. Why do you stick around?

LIZ

(after a beat)

Because of my brother. Pete. He'd

never leave.

MACREEDY

Didn't you ever think of going without

him. You're sort of independent and

he's... he's...

LIZ

Weak. I know. That's why I couldn't

leave him.

MACREEDY

(softly)

What did your brother do?

LIZ

He... I...

(flaring again)

What do you care? What do you care

about Black Rock?

MACREEDY

Nothing much. Only, there're not

many places like this in America --

but even one is too many. Because I

think something sort of bad happened

here.

(frowning)

Something I can't find the handle

to...

LIZ

You just think so. You don't know.

MACREEDY

This much I know -- the rule of law

has been suspended in this town. The

gorillas have taken over.

LIZ

You're a fine one to talk! You come

in here, sneaking around, trying to

steal the key to my jeep.

MACREEDY

I kind of had a notion that was the

only way I could get it.

MACREEDY

(simply)

Was I wrong, Miss Brooks?

SMITH

(calling)

Mr. Macreedy.

(reasonably, as

Macreedy turns toward

him)

I'd like to ask you a few questions...

as long as you're around...

MACREEDY

(walking up steps)

I'm around all right.

MACREEDY

(with just a touch of

wryness)

You probably know that Miss Brooks

is no longer in the car rental

business?

SMITH

(solemnly)

Good. I wouldn't want to see that

girl get into trouble...

MACREEDY

You wouldn't?

SMITH

...what with rental permits, gas

rationing... you know what I mean.

MACREEDY

Sure. I admire your sturdy sense of

responsibility.

SMITH

(dismissively)

It's just, a girl like that has a

future.

MACREEDY

Let's talk about my future.

SMITH

(almost slyly)

Do you have the time?

MACREEDY

I don't seem to be going any place.

SMITH

(after a pause)

I hear you handle a jeep real well.

MACREEDY

I have a way with jeeps. A certain

familiarity.

SMITH

I think I understand. You're an Army

man.

(looking at Macreedy's

stiff arm)

Where'd you get it?

MACREEDY

Italy.

SMITH

(sincerely)

Tough. I tried to get in myself, the

day after those rats bombed Pearl

Harbor.

MACREEDY

What stopped you?

SMITH

The physical. They wouldn't take me.

The morning after Pearl, I was the

first man in line at Marine recruiting

in Sand City. And they wouldn't take

me.

MACREEDY

(flatly)

Tough.

SMITH

What do you do in Los Angeles, Mr.

Macreedy?

MACREEDY

I'm retired.

SMITH

You're a pretty young man...

MACREEDY

You might say I was forced into

retirement.

SMITH

What were you looking for in Adobe

Flat?

MACREEDY

Komako, like I told you. Like you

told me, he wasn't there.

MACREEDY

What's so funny?

SMITH

Nothing. It's just -- I don't believe

you. I believe a man is as big as

what he seeks. I believe you're a

big man, Mr. Macreedy.

MACREEDY

Flattery will get you nowhere.

SMITH

Why would a man like you be looking

for a lousy Jap farmer?

MACREEDY

Maybe I'm not so big.

SMITH

Yes, you are.

(a beat; looking hard

at Macreedy)

I believe that a man is as big as

the things that make him mad. Nobody

around here has been big enough to

make you mad.

MACREEDY

What makes you mad, Mr. Smith?

SMITH

Me...? Nothing in particular.

MACREEDY

(bemused)

I see. You're a big man, too. Only...

(calmly)

...the Japanese make you mad...

SMITH

That's different. After the sneak

attack on Pearl Harbor... after

Bataan...

MACREEDY

...and Komako made you mad.

SMITH

It's the same thing.

(scoffing)

Loyal Japanese-Americans -- that's a

laugh. They're mad dogs. Look at

Corregidor, the death march.

MACREEDY

What did Komako have to do with

Corregidor?

SMITH

Wasn't he a Jap? Look, Macreedy,

there's a law in this county against

shooting dogs. But if I see a mad

dog loose, I don't wait for him to

bite me.

(exhales sharply,

shaking his head

with irritation)

I swear, you're beginning to make me

mad.

MACREEDY

(calmly)

All strangers do.

SMITH

Not all. Some of 'em. When they come

here snooping.

MACREEDY

Snooping for what?

SMITH

I mean, outsiders coming around,

looking for something.

MACREEDY

(pressing)

For what?

SMITH

I don't know. People are always

looking for something in this part

of the West. To the historian, it's

the "Old West." To the book writers,

it's the "Wild West." To the

businessmen, it's the "Undeveloped

West." They all say we're backward

and poor, and I guess we are.

(snorts)

We don't even have enough water.

(a beat)

But this place, to us, is our West.

(heatedly)

I just wish they'd leave us alone.

MACREEDY

Leave you alone to do what?

SMITH

(coldly)

I don't know what you mean.

MACREEDY

What happened to Komako?

SMITH

He went away, I told you. Shortly

after he left, a bunch of kids got

fooling around out his place. They

burned it down. It was one of those

things -- you know how kids are.

SMITH

What's funny?

MACREEDY

Nothing. Only -- I don't believe

you. Any more than I believed you

about the letters.

SMITH

(smiling)

You don't seem to believe anything I

say.

MACREEDY

(vaguely)

Yes, I do -- about businessmen, for

instance. I think a businessman would

be interested in Adobe Flat.

SMITH

Why?

MACREEDY

All that land lying fallow. Could be

put to some use. Like a graveyard.

(Smith opens his mouth

to speak but Macreedy

goes on)

A historian might be interested,

too. Because of the strange customs

around here, such as burying cattle...

SMITH

Burying cattle...?

MACREEDY

(calmly)

Something's buried out there.

MACREEDY

See these wild flowers? That means a

grave. I've seen it overseas. I figure

it isn't a man's grave or someone

would have marked it. Sort of a

mystery, isn't it?

SMITH

Sort of. Maybe you can figure it

out.

MACREEDY

Maybe.

SMITH

Why not give it a whirl?

(Macreedy turns)

It'll help you pass the time...

(continued;

meaningfully)

...for a while.

MACREEDY

Not interested. I got other things

to do.

DOC

Hi. Pull up a chair.

MACREEDY

(nodding)

Can I use your phone?

DOC

Help yourself.

(chuckles)

You know, you're one of the few people

who's ever been back here I can say

that to.

DOC

It's 4-2-4.

MACREEDY

(pausing)

What's 4-2-4?

DOC

If I've got you pegged -- and I think

I have -- you're calling the State

Police. But if I was you -- and I'm

purely glad I'm not -- I'd look it

up myself.

(emphatically)

I wouldn't trust anybody around here,

including me.

MACREEDY

(to Doc)

Thanks.

(into receiver)

4-2-4.

PETE

(into phone)

4-2-4...?

(he looks up)

PETE

(into phone)

Lines 're busy.

(he clicks off the

instrument)

DOC

(sing-song)

I know -- don't tell me -- lines all

busy. They'll be busy all day.

MACREEDY

(after a beat,

grimacing)

Don't look at me like that.

DOC

Like what?

MACREEDY

Like I'm a potential customer.

DOC

Everybody is -- and I get 'em coming

and going.

DOC

(gesturing toward it)

First I sell 'em a piece of land.

Think they farm it? Nope. They dig

for gold.

DOC

They rip off the top soil of ten

winding hills. They sprint in here,

fog-heaved with excitement, lugging

nuggets, big and bright and shiny.

DOC

(rhetorically)

Is it gold?

DOC

It is not! Do they quit? They do

not!

DOC

(with theatrical

gesture toward

reproduction)

Then they decide to farm. Farm! In

country so dry you have to prime a

man before he can spit, and before

you can say "Fat Sam" they're stalled,

stranded and starving. They get weevil-

brained and buttsprung...

DOC

(simply)

So I bury 'em.

(a beat, as he rejoins

Macreedy in the center

of the room)

But why should I bore you with my

triumphs?

MACREEDY

Yeah. I've got a problem of my own.

DOC

(like an old testament

prophet)

They're going to kill you with no

hard feelings.

MACREEDY

(nastily)

And you'll just sit on your hands

and let them.

DOC

Don't get waspish with me, young

feller.

MACREEDY

Sorry.

DOC

I feel for you, but I'm consumed

with apathy. Why should I mix in?

MACREEDY

To save a life.

DOC

I got enough trouble saving my own.

(he refills his glass

from a milk bottle

on the desk)

I try to live right and drink my

orange juice every day. But mostly I

try to mind my own business. Which

is something I'd advise you to do.

MACREEDY

It's a little late for that...

DOC

You can still get out of town. And

you'd better get out like a whisper.

MACREEDY

How can I?

DOC

(taking a key ring

from his pocket)

I got sort of a limousine at your

disposal.

MACREEDY

Where is it?

DOC

(tossing him the key)

Out back.

MACREEDY

(concentrating on the

dashboard)

Won't start.

DOC

(nervously, to Macreedy)

Something wrong?

MACREEDY

Just won't start...

HECTOR

(gratuitously)

Could be the wirin'. Why don't you

look under the hood?

MACREEDY

For that I thank you.

(pause)

How much time you think I've got

before...?

DOC

They'll wait at least till dark.

(angrily)

They'd be afraid to see each other's

faces.

MACREEDY

(slapping Doc's

shoulder lightly)

Well, so long, Doc. I can't say it's

been charming but...

DOC

Where are you going?

MACREEDY

I don't know. But I'm going on foot.

DOC

That's no good. You stray ten yards

off Main Street, and you'll be stone,

cold dead.

(offers Macreedy a

cigarette)

That's the situation, in a nut.

HECTOR

It's the wirin', like I said. Now

wasn't that a good guess?

MACREEDY

(quietly)

It can be fixed.

HECTOR

Easy. Unless, of course, this here

wire...

(reaching inside the

hood, pointing)

...got broke or something.

DOC

(suddenly, heatedly,

turning on Hector)

Do the nice little things, like keep

your big fat nose out of my business.

HECTOR

(triumphantly, holding

up the wires)

Yep. It's the wirin'.

DOC

(softly, after a beat)

I'm sorry, son. You got to admit, I

tried.

MACREEDY

(as if to himself)

Maybe...

DOC

Maybe what?

MACREEDY

If I can't get out of town, maybe I

can get the state cops in.

DOC

(irritably)

You tried the phone, didn't you? You

know what happened, don't you?

MACREEDY

There's another way. I'll be seeing

you, Doc.

DOC

(calling)

I hope you'll be seeing me.

QUICK DISSOLVE:

HASTINGS

You notifyin' the state po-lice?

MACREEDY

(putting a bill on

the counter)

That's what it says.

HASTINGS

(plaintively)

Lemonade?

HASTINGS

(mopping his forehead)

It's hot as Billy-be-durned.

HASTINGS

Don't you like lemonade?

MACREEDY

I never thought much about it.

HASTINGS

It don't have the muzzle velocity of

some other drinks drunk around here,

but it's good for what ails you.

MACREEDY

(after a beat)

What ails you, Mr. Hastings?

HASTINGS

Me...?

MACREEDY

Why are you so upset about...

(points)

...this wire?

HASTINGS

Me...?

MACREEDY

Are you afraid, Mr. Hastings?

HASTINGS

Me...?

(a beat, then softly)

I guess I am.

(awkwardly he puts

Macreedy's bill back

on the counter)

But what's the use talkin'...?

(with grudging respect)

You don't know what it's like, being

scared.

MACREEDY

(not unsympathetically)

You want me to describe the symptoms?

Right this minute I'm scared half to

death.

HASTINGS

(simply)

You should be.

MACREEDY

Yeah. But not of the state police.

HASTINGS

(stonily)

Neither am I.

MACREEDY

Then what are you afraid of? The

grave at Adobe Flat? A grave nobody

marked, nobody knows anything about.

HASTINGS

That ain't it, either.

MACREEDY

Is it Smith?

(no answer)

Is it?!

HASTINGS

(squirming)

Look, Mr. Macreedy. I'm just a good

neighbor...

MACREEDY

To Smith you are. How about to Komako?

HASTINGS

(meeting Macreedy's

eyes)

I never seen Komako in my life.

Honest.

MACREEDY

(again pushes the

bill toward Hastings)

Then send that wire, and bring me

the answer. You'll do that, won't

you?

HASTINGS

(pauses, then worriedly

picking up the bill)

Yes, sir.

QUICK DISSOLVE:

KROOL

I tell you, I won't have anything to

do with it.

MURTRY

(nodding emphatically)

Live and let live, that's what I

say.

BENTHAM

(frowning)

I don't know. I just don't know.

LENARD

(to Bentham)

You gonna brood about it? Or you

want another beer?

BENTHAM

A beer, I guess. Only...

SAM

What'll you have?

MACREEDY

What have you got?

SAM

Chili wit' beans.

MACREEDY

Anything else?

SAM

Chili wit'out beans.

SAM

You don't like the taste, that's

what they make ketchup for.

MACREEDY

In that case, I'll have it. And a

cup of coffee.

COLEY

(to Macreedy, with

menacing friendliness)

You still around? I thought you didn't

like this place.

MACREEDY

(pleasantly)

Going to, or coming from?

COLEY

Staying put.

MACREEDY

No comment.

COLEY

(to Smith, gesturing

a thumb toward

Macreedy)

No comment, he says. No comment, and

all the time he's got my chair.

MACREEDY

I always seem to be taking somebody's

place around here.

COLEY

This seat ain't comfortable.

MACREEDY

I was afraid of that.

COLEY

I think I'd like the seat you're on.

SMITH

(to Macreedy, mildly)

He's as changeable as a prairie fire.

MACREEDY

(to Coley)

Suppose you tell me where to sit.

COLEY

(to Macreedy)

I hope that ain't too much.

MACREEDY

(to Smith, gesturing

toward Coley)

Your friend's a very [...] fellow.

SMITH

(nodding)

Sort of unpredictable, too. Got a

temper like a rattlesnake.

COLEY

That's me all over. I'm half hoss,

half alligator. Mess with me, I'll

kick a lung outta you. What do you

think of that?

MACREEDY

No comment.

COLEY

Talking to you is like pulling teeth.

You wear me out.

(loudly, after a beat)

You're a yellow-bellied Jap lover.

Am I right or wrong?

MACREEDY

You're not only wrong -- you're wrong

at the top of your voice.

COLEY

You don't like my voice?

MACREEDY

(again turning to

Smith)

I think your friend's trying to start

something.

SMITH

Now why-ever would he want to do

that?

MACREEDY

I don't know. Maybe he figures, needle

me enough and I'll crack. Maybe I'll

even fight back. Then he or Hector --

your other ape -- would beat me to

death and cop a plea of self-defense.

SMITH

I don't think that'll be necessary.

You're so scared now you'll probably

drown in your own sweat.

COLEY

Before that happens, couldn't I pick

a fight with you if I tied one hand

behind me...?

COLEY

If I tied both hands...?

MACREEDY

(to Smith)

Wouldn't it be easier if you just

waited till I turned my back?

(looking toward the

loafers at the bar,

then back at Smith)

Or are there too many witnesses

present?

SMITH

(with effortless

ferocity)

You're still in trouble.

MACREEDY

So are you.

(Smith snorts)

Whatever happens -- you're lost.

SMITH

You got things a bit twisted...

MACREEDY

You killed Komako. Sooner or later

you'll go up for it. Not because you

killed him -- in this town you

probably could have gotten away with

it -- but because you didn't even

have the guts to do it alone. You

put your trust in guys like him...

(gesturing toward the

unconscious Coley)

...and Hector -- they're not the

most dependable of God's creatures.

Sooner or later they'll get the idea

you're playing them for saps. What'll

you do then -- peel them off, one by

one? And in the meantime if any one

of them breaks, you'll go down hard.

Because they got something on you.

Something to use when things get

tough.

MACREEDY

And they're getting tougher every

minute.

DOC

(softly, full of awe)

Man... man-oh-man.

QUICK DISSOLVE:

MACREEDY

Anything for me?

PETE

Nothing.

MACREEDY

Any message -- a telegram?

PETE

(returning to his

cards)

Nothing.

DOC

(to Macreedy, shrilly,

gruffly)

In case you're interested, Coley'll

live.

(glaring at Smith and

Hector)

I'm truly sorry to say.

HECTOR

(to Doc, jerking a

fat hand toward

Macreedy)

Your friend's pretty tough.

DOC

Yeah. He's wicked. He defends himself

when he's attacked.

DOC

(with some irritation)

Well...? You going to just sit here

and let time run out?

MACREEDY

I'm waiting for a wire. From the

state cops.

DOC

You sent it through Hastings?

(an audible sigh)

Just don't expect an answer, if that's

the way you sent it.

MACREEDY

(looking toward the

door)

No?

(he rises)

MACREEDY

(evenly, to Smith)

I think that's for me.

(he takes the message

from Smith's hand

and quickly glances

at it. Looking up at

Hastings)

Where's the answer?

SMITH

You expect an answer -- to a wire

that's never sent?

SMITH

What's so funny?

MACREEDY

Nothing. Just a thought --

(his eyes turn to

Hastings. Hastings

wilts)

-- a thought dazzling in its purity...

MACREEDY

(slowly)

You're in a jam, Hastings. You gave

my telegram to Smith.

DOC

(excitedly)

You warty wretch! That's a federal

offense!

MACREEDY

(to Smith)

You're in deep, too.

(grins hard)

Like I said, it's getting tougher

and tougher.

(to Tim)

Sheriff, you'd better do something

about this.

TIM

(to Smith)

I reckon that's right, Mr. Smith...

HECTOR

Don't be a jerk, Tim.

TIM

(to Smith, seriously)

Divulging information -- there's a

law...

SMITH

Tim, you're pathetic.

TIM

(doggedly)

Could be. But I'm still Sheriff.

SMITH

That's the point. You're not Sheriff

any more. You just lost a job, you're

so pathetic.

SMITH

(to Hector)

All right, Sheriff. Take over.

DOC

You can't do that!

SMITH

Can't I? I put him in office. Now I

take him out.

HECTOR

Now. You want to register a complaint?

HECTOR

To register a complaint, boy, you've

got to have evidence. You got

evidence?

HECTOR

You got a big mouth, boy, makin'

accusations, disturbin' the peace.

There's laws in this county protectin'

innocent folks from big mouths. Why,

I'd just hate to...

SMITH

(interrupting)

Hector...

(wearily)

Come on, Hector.

DOC

(hopefully)

It's all right, Tim. We're not licked

yet.

TIM

(numbly)

Ain't we? I am.

DOC

There comes a time, Tim, when a man's

just got to do something.

TIM

Not me. I'm useless, and I know it.

DOC

(imploring)

No man is useless, if he's got a

friend...

DOC

I'm your friend, Tim.

TIM

Then let me alone.

DOC

(jabbing at Macreedy

with a thumb)

He's going to need you before the

night is over.

DOC

(contemptuously)

And all the useful men are on the

other side.

TIM

(angrily)

Lemme alone, I tell ya!

DOC

I can't let you alone! I can't let

myself alone! Don't you understand

that?

(he turns from Tim to

Pete, who is unable

to shake his gaze.

Then, sadly, fiercely)

Four years ago something terrible

happened here. We did nothing about

it. Nothing. The whole town fell

into a sort of settled melancholy,

and the people in it closed their

eyes and held their tongues and failed

the test with a whimper.

DOC

Now something terrible is going to

happen again, and in a way we're

lucky because we've been given a

second chance. And this time I won't

close my eyes, I won't hold my tongue,

and if I'm needed I won't fail.

(almost harshly, again

facing Tim)

And neither will you!

TIM

I got such a headache, I'm bewildered.

I hurt all over.

MACREEDY

I know --

(unconsciously his

right arm strays to

massage the paralyzed

left)

-- pain is bewildering. I came here

bewildered, full of self-pity, afraid

to fight back.

(gesturing with his

hand to Pete)

And then your friend Smith tried to

kill me.

(the muscles around

Pete's mouth tighten)

Funny, how a man clings to the earth

when he feels there's a chance he

may never see it again.

DOC

There's a difference between clinging

to the earth...

(eyeing Tim almost

contemptuously)

...and crawling on it. You going to

stand by and watch forever?

TIM

(flatly)

I ain't gonna watch, and I ain't

gonna get into it, either.

TIM

I'm gettin' out. I'm sorry, Mr.

Macreedy.

PETE

(to Doc)

You'd be smart to get out, too.

DOC

(angrily turning to

Pete)

There's too many smart guys around

here. I'm glad I'm a dummy.

PETE

You're a troublesome dummy. You're

liable to end up on your own slab...

DOC

(heatedly)

I expect to be in a lot more trouble

before I die...

PETE

Go home, Doc.

(he jerks his head

toward Macreedy, and

with mock bravado...)

He's all washed up.

MACREEDY

(grinning harshly at

him)

You think so?

MACREEDY

I was washed up when I got off that

train...

PETE

(flatly)

You shouldn' of got off.

MACREEDY

Had to. I had one last duty to perform

before I resigned from the human

race.

DOC

(quizzically)

I thought you were going to Los

Angeles, that hot-bed of pomp and

vanity. Is that resigning from the

human race?

MACREEDY

(shrugging)

L.A.'s a good jumping off place --

for the Islands, for Mexico, Central

America.

DOC

Why?

MACREEDY

(again shrugs)

I don't know. I was looking for a

place to get lost, I guess.

DOC

Why?

MACREEDY

(slapping his paralyzed

arm with the whisky

bottle)

Because of this. I thought I'd never

be able to function again.

(turning to Pete)

Thanks to your friend Smith, I found

I was wrong.

PETE

(drily)

Sure. You're a man of action.

MACREEDY

(slowly)

I know your problem.

(with mounting vigor)

You'd like me to die quickly, without

wasting too much of your time...

(Pete opens his mouth

to say something,

but Macreedy presses

on)

...or silently, without making you

feel too uncomfortable... or

thankfully, without making your

memories of the occasion too

unpleasant.

PETE

(bitterly)

My memories are so pleasant as it

is...

MACREEDY

(quietly pressing his

advantage)

What happened, Pete?

DOC

Are you going to tell him -- or you

want me to?

(beat)

Smith owns Adobe Flat. He leased it

to Komako -- thought he had cheated

him, thought Komako could never even

run stock without water. There was

never any water on Adobe Flat. Komako

dug a well, by hand. He must have

went down one hundred and fifty feet.

PETE

He got water, plenty. Smith was pretty

sore. He didn't like Japs anyway.

DOC

That's an understatement.

PETE

The day after Pearl Harbor, Smith

went to Sand City.

MACREEDY

(interrupting)

I know. To enlist. He was turned

down.

PETE

He was sore when he got back. About

ten o'clock he started drinking.

MACREEDY

Ten o'clock in the morning.

PETE

Yeah. Hector joined him, and Coley.

Then Sam, and about nine p.m. -- me.

We were all drunk -- patriotic drunk.

We went out to Komako's for a little

fun, I guess -- scare him a little.

MACREEDY

Did you know him?

PETE

We'd seen him around some, but none

of us knew him. When he heard us

coming, he locked the door. Smith

started a fire. The Jap came running

out. His clothes were burning. Smith

shot him. I didn't even know Smith

had a gun.

MACREEDY

Then you all got scared, buried him,

kept quiet.

MACREEDY

(softly)

Did Komako have any family besides

his son Joe?

DOC

(puzzled)

His son...? Nobody around here knew

he had a son.

MACREEDY

He had one. But he's dead, too. He's

buried in Italy.

DOC

What are you doing here, Mr. Macreedy?

MACREEDY

Joe Komako died in Italy, saving my

life. They gave him a medal. I came

here to give it to his father.

PETE

(awfully)

God forgive me...

MACREEDY

(to Pete, harshly

guttural)

It'll take a lot of whiskey to wash

out your guts...

MACREEDY

...And it will never help -- not

even a barrel full washes away murder!

MACREEDY

But maybe I'm wrong. Go on -- drink.

(scornfully)

What else is left for you?!

(mounting anger)

You're as dead as Komako, only you

don't know it!

(roaring)

You also don't know that it's not

enough to feel guilty. It's not enough

to confess. It's not enough to say,

"Forgive me, I've done wrong."

DOC

Take it easy, Macreedy. Sit down.

MACREEDY

(turning on him)

Sit down?! Or would you rather have

me kneel, to beg his pardon for

raising a touchy subject?

PETE

(shaking his head)

You don't have to remind me. I've

never forgotten...

MACREEDY

Well, that's mighty noble of you.

You feel ashamed -- that's noble,

too.

(in mounting crescendo)

And four years from now you'll

probably be sitting here telling

somebody else you haven't forgotten

me. That's progress -- you'll still

be ashamed but I'll be dead.

MACREEDY

Go on, have your drink.

(with exorbitant scorn)

You need it.

DOC

(leaning over counter,

staring at him)

What are you doing?

PETE

(into phone, ignoring

Doc)

Hello, Liz. Now listen... I... 'm

getting Macreedy out of town...

PETE

(into phone)

I don't care about Smith! Let him

try to kill me -- I might as well be

dead as...

PETE

(into phone,

interrupting)

Liz, Liz... There's not much of me

left any more, but however little it

is I won't waste it!

(again Liz's voice

briefly; then...)

I'm telling you because we need your

help.

(again Liz's voice)

...No matter about the past -- you've

got to do this! You'd be saving two

lives, Liz. Macreedy's, and mine.

(again Liz answers

and...)

All right. Yeah... I've told him

everything.

PETE

(flatly)

She'll be here in five minutes.

MACREEDY

Thanks, Pete. Thanks very much.

DISSOLVE TO:

PETE

(controlling his

jangled nerves)

Hector!

HECTOR

Hmmmm?

HECTOR

What you want?

PETE

He's still in his room. Macreedy, I

mean.

HECTOR

So...? You want me to tuck him in?

PETE

I thought maybe you wanted to tell

Smith.

HECTOR

(explaining something

he feels Pete already

knows)

Smith said he'd be here at midnight.

He don't want to be disturbed.

HECTOR

You got a match?

PETE

Come on. I got some in the lobby.

HECTOR

I thought you didn't have a match.

MACREEDY

(with a half smile)

I'll never forgive you, Doc...

(he gestures toward

Hector, out cold)

...for depriving me of that pleasure.

QUICK DISSOLVE:

LIZ

Sorry I can't get more out of this

heap.

LIZ

(with a burst of

irritation)

We could make better time with a dog

team.

MACREEDY

(calmly)

You're doing the best you can.

(a beat)

Aren't you, Liz?

LIZ

Don't expect too much from me.

MACREEDY

(dryly)

Don't worry, I won't.

LIZ

(quickly)

I mean, people have always expected

things from me. You know why? Because

I'm pretty. Well, that's not enough.

LIZ

(softly)

Maybe I could have been something --

a model, or something.

(glancing at him)

You don't believe that.

MACREEDY

Yes I do.

LIZ

Well, I don't, really. I'm a dime a

dozen.

MACREEDY

That I don't believe.

LIZ

I'm too little and too late.

MACREEDY

It's never too late.

LIZ

I lack the muscle.

MACREEDY

(frowning)

Why is muscle so important?

LIZ

(cynically)

Oh, you're the brainy type.

(harshly)

Did it take brains to rough up Coley?

Whatever you did to Hector, you didn't

do it with brains. How'd you get

Pete to change his mind?

MACREEDY

Not with muscle.

LIZ

And not with brains, either. He's a

pushover for a muscle man.

MACREEDY

I'm beginning' to think it runs in

the family.

(looking at her hard)

You think strength is in the width

of a man's shoulders.

LIZ

I'd sure have liked to see you tangle

with Reno Smith.

MACREEDY

He wasn't around when I left... Maybe

I will yet.

MACREEDY

(alert, expectant)

What's this?

LIZ

(vamping nervously)

We need water...

(she turns off engine,

pulling ignition key

from its lock)

...radiator's overheating.

LIZ

Leggo! Leggo of me!

MACREEDY

(harshly, through his

teeth)

You're stupid, Liz. You're a fool.

If he finishes me, he's got to finish

you.

LIZ

(calling toward the

headlights)

Smitty! Smitty!

SMITH'S VOICE

(o.s.)

I'm here, honey. Just head for the

car.

LIZ

(an almost bantering

voice)

So long, Macreedy.

SMITH

(o.s.)

Just a few more steps, honey.

LIZ

(breathlessly)

Get him! Get him now!

SMITH

(easily)

First things first, honey.

LIZ

(unsure, reaching out

her hand)

Help me up, Smitty.

SMITH

You were going to help me, Liz.

(she looks at him

quizzically)

I still need your help.

LIZ

(confused)

I did what you said...

SMITH

You two started out in a car. That's

the way you'll end up. Over a cliff,

burning.

(she tries to interrupt

him, but he goes

on...)

You can blame that on Macreedy, too.

He said I had too many witnesses.

LIZ

(dry whisper)

But why me? Why start with me?

SMITH

I got to start with somebody.

LIZ

(yelling wildly)

Macreedy! Macreedy!

LIZ

(sadly, almost

reproachfully)

You shouldn't have done that...

SMITH

(through his teeth)

Go ahead -- kill me. Now.

MACREEDY

I'd like to kill you now, but you

caused too much pain to die quickly.

(a beat)

You'll be tried in a court of law.

You'll be convicted by a jury. Then

you'll die.

DISSOLVE:

MACREEDY

(tonelessly, prodding

Smith off the fender

with his rifle)

Hands behind your head.

MACREEDY

(after a beat)

Am I going to have trouble with you?

TIM

Nope. But I sure thought the situation

was going to be like reversed. I

thought I was going to have trouble...

(nodding sharply in

Smith's direction)

...with him. I'll take care of him.

MACREEDY

(still hesitating)

Just as you took care of his buddies?

TIM

Just as I took care of his buddies.

Me, an' Doc, and Pete...

DOC

(to Macreedy)

It's all right, Macreedy...

DOC

Old Tim here's got his badge back.

MACREEDY

(looking around)

Well. The gang is all here.

TIM

I thought I'd take one last whack at

my job. Even if Smith killed me for

it.

MACREEDY

(jerking his head

toward Smith)

Put him in with Hastings.

MACREEDY

Your sister's outside, Pete.

MACREEDY

(flatly)

She's dead.

DISSOLVE:

MACREEDY

(walking, after a

beat, to Doc)

Tim knows where to find me if I'm

needed.

MACREEDY

What's on your mind, Doc?

DOC

Nothing. Only... about that medal.

Can we have it?

MACREEDY

"We...?" Can who have it?

DOC

We.

(indicating the

townspeople, with a

vague wave of his

hand)

Us.

MACREEDY

Why?

DOC

Well, we need it, I guess. It's

something we can maybe build on.

This town is wrecked, just as bad as

if it was bombed out. Maybe it can

come back...

MACREEDY

Some towns come back. Some don't. It

depends on the people.

DOC

(still pressing)

That medal would help.

DOC

Thanks, Macreedy. Thanks for

everything.

CONDUCTOR

(curiously)

What's the excitement? What happened?

MACREEDY

A shooting.

CONDUCTOR

I knew it was something. First time

a streamliner stopped here in four

years.

MACREEDY

Second time.

FADE OUT:

THE END
