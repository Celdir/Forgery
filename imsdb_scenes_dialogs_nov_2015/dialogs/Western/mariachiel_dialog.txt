FADE IN:

MOCO (V.O.)

Good morning, Azul. Do you know who this

is?

AZUL

(into phone)

Moco... What the hell do you want after

all these years?

MOCO

(into phone)

We've got a lot to talk about. I'm just a

few town away with a whole new gang. I

heard you were nearby so I thought I'd

give you a call, amigo.

AZUL (V.O)

That's sweet of you, asshole. I don't

suppose you could get me out of there,

and then maybe hand me over my share of

money.

MOCO

(into phone)

Yes, I figured you'd want your money, my

friend. That is why I have called you. I

heard you were getting out soon, and

figured I should deal with our situation.

But do you really need me to help you get

out? From what I hear, you're running

quite a business out of your cell with a

phone and some loyal men. It keeps you

well protected I hear. Not a bad idea. I

may try that myself sometime.

AZUL (V.O.)

I could stay in here and earn peanuts

compared to what you owe me if I were to

get out. So, yes, I want you to help

me... my friend.

(CONTINUED)

3.

MOCO

(into phone)

Soon my friend, soon. I'm sending you

some people in a few days to get you.

AZUL (V.O.)

Really? Well, that's more like it. Just

like the Moco I used to know.

MOCO

(into phone)

Just hang in there my friend. I won't

forget that you have been a big part of

our success. What's wrong.

AZUL

(into phone)

There's something going on outside. Is

this a double surprise? Are you getting

me out today, Moco?

4.

AZUL

(into phone)

There are two men here with guns. Did you

send them?

(CONTINUED)

5.

AZUL

(into phone)

I'm still here, Moco. And so are your

little friends. But not for long. They

have something they want to scream to

you. Listen close, because you're going

to repeat it to me when I come to visit

you.

(CONTINUED)

6.

BARTENDER

What do you want to drink?

MARIACHI

Refresco.

MARIACHI (CONT'D)

No hay musica?

BARTENDER

(cleaning a glass)

Why?

MARIACHI

I'm a mariachi. A good one. I play

beautiful ballads, old classic ballads,

on an old-fashioned guitar.

BARTENDER

So what?

(CONTINUED)

7.

MARIACHI

I could add a little class to this place.

I work for fairly cheap, I live mostly

off tips. But I need steady work, and I

can guarantee bringing in more customers.

BARTENDER

(nodding)

Tell me, why would I need one little

guitar player when I've already got a

full band?

BARTENDER (CONT'D)

(nodding with satisfaction)

There you see? Either I can pay one guy

to sound like a full mariachi band...

BARTENDER (CONT'D)

... or I could spend the same money only

get one little guitar player...

Understand?

MARIACHI

(walking away)

Thank you, sir.

(CONTINUED)

8.

BARTENDER

You want to earn a living? Get a real

musical instrument.

BARTENDER

(laughing and rolling his eyes)

What the hell is this, mariachi day?

There is no work for you here!

AZUL

Bartender... one beer.

(CONTINUED)

9.

AZUL (CONT'D)

(without looking at him)

In a bottle, wey.

BARTENDER

Ready.

AZUL

I'm looking for an old friend of mine.

His name is... Moco. Do you know where I

can find him.

AZUL

So you know him?

AZUL

That's too bad.

AZUL (CONT'D)

Hold it please.

(CONTINUED)

10.

(CONTINUED)

11.

BARTENDER

(into phone)

Get me Moco!!!

MOCO

(into phone)

12.

VIEJO CLERK

(without looking)

Take it.

VIEJO CLERK

Yeah, pit bull.

MEAN DUDE #5

(into phone)

Dead?

MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)

(into phone)

All of them? How long ago? OK, What does

this guy look like?

13.

MEAN DUDE #5

(into phone)

... carries a guitar case... And what was

he wearing?... all black...

MEAN DUDE #5

(into phone)

Don't worry, Moco. We'll find him, and

we'll mess him up real good.

(ad lib)

MEAN DUDE #5

Gracias senor...

VIEJO CLERK

Callate, hombre!!!

SLOW MOTION SEQUENCE (?)

Mariachi looks up at the Clerk, then

stands.

(CONTINUED)

14.

MEAN DUDE #5

Viejo, if you see anyone new in town,

carrying a guitar case, dressed in

black... you can call this number, OK?

VIEJO CLERK

(nodding sarcastically)

And if I don't call, you'll kill me...

MEAN DUDE

(handing him the card)

No. I won't kill you... he will...

MARIACHI

Pit bull.

(CONTINUED)

15.

VIEJO CLERK

Yeah, pit bull.

MARIACHI

I need a cheap room for a week, and I'd

prefer to pay you in a few days, after

I've found some work.

VIEJO CLERK

Si, later...

MARIACHI

Thank you...

MARIACHI (CONT'D)

Thank you, friend.

VIEJO CLERK

(different tone of voice)

Uh, excuse me senor? I forgot, I need a

small deposit...

MARIACHI

(walking back slowly)

You can trust me.

VIEJO CLERK

I am very sorry, senor. But... how much

can you spare?

MARIACHI

(disappointed)

I've only got a few pesos... I plan on

finding work in town.

VIEJO CLERK

(grabbing money)

Oh, that's enough for now, sir, thank you

and... enjoy your stay.

(CONTINUED)

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

17.

VIEJO CLERK

127!!! Cuarto 127, pendejos!!!

MARIACHI'S POV

As camera nears the door, doorknob starts

to move. Remembering that he never locked

the door, he jumps to the side of the

door as...

18.

MARIACHI

(pointing to his room)

Cuidado, viejo!

VIEJO CLERK

(pointing in Mariachi's

direction)

Pendejos!!!

19.

MEAN DUDE #5

He wears black!

VIEJO CLERK

(screaming, pointing inside)

20.

(CONTINUED)

21.

DOMINO

What happened to you, Mariachi? Too much

refresco?

MARIACHI

I just killed four guys.

DOMINO

Is it true?

(CONTINUED)

22.

MARIACHI

(exhausted)

Wait a minute... what's your name?

DOMINO

Domino.

MARIACHI

Wait a minute, Domino! It was self-

defense.

MARIACHI (CONT'D)

(frantic)

I'm new in town. I don't know everyone!!!

I have no friends here... and no enemies.

DOMINO

(lowering the gun a bit)

Thieves?

MARIACHI

(nodding)

No way. They were well-dressed men. I

checked into the cheapest hotel in town,

no money, nothing of value, except this

guitar and maybe this coat, which they

could have taken when I left my room, but

they didn't. They were only interested in

killing me.

DOMINO

(lifting the gun back up)

So why do you come here? You want to get

me killed?

MARIACHI

I need a place to stay until I figure

this out. They've got me mixed up with

someone else.

DOMINO

And you've never seen them before? Not

even in another town?

(CONTINUED)

23.

MARIACHI

(long pause)

Are you saying they followed me, a

mariachi, here? What for?

DOMINO

Maybe they hate your music.

DOMINO (CONT'D)

Maybe you were singing in another town,

they hated your voice, and now they're

trying to kill you.

MARIACHI

Are you serious?

DOMINO

(nodding)

Yes.

MARIACHI

Are you going to help me, or am I gonna

have to die on your porch?

DOMINO

I have a room upstairs. My room. Don't

touch anything. I'll be up after awhile

and we can call a friend of mine.

MARIACHI

Thank you. I'll never forget this.

DOMINO

This way.

(CONTINUED)

24.

MEAN DUDE #5

Good morning, Domino.

DOMINO

What happened?

MEAN DUDE #5

Give me the phone. I have to call Moco.

MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)

It's not as bad as it looks. Domino, has

anyone come through here? A stranger,

maybe?

DOMINO

This is a border town. I get strangers

all the time.

MEAN DUDE #5

Dressed all in black, carrying a guitar

case?

DOMINO

No.

MEAN DUDE #5

Well, he shot me... and has killed ten of

Moco's men... all in one day.

DOMINO

Aren't you gonna call your boss?

(CONTINUED)

25.

MEAN DUDE #5

(nodding)

I have to tell Moco that he got away

again... So, you better give me a drink

first.

MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)

(into phone)

Moco, he got away. Shot me in the arm.

Killed La Palma. Pepino, Sunday. This guy

is one slick maricon. Yeah. Also, I

didn't get a look at him. So, unless he's

still carrying that guitar around and

hasn't changed clothes, I won't even spot

him, and I don't think he'll be that

obvious...

MOCO (V.O.)

Don't worry. If there's one thing I know,

it's that he'll always wear black and

he'll always carry that guitar with him.

It's his signature. Besides, that's not a

guitar he's carrying. It's a guitar case

full of weapons. Find him.

DOMINO

Que paso

MEAN DUDE #5

I screwed up. The guy left his guitar

case in the hotel room. We chased him

out, but he came back for the case.

DOMINO

Maybe he loves his guitar. It's probably

an antique.

MEAN DUDE #5

It wasn't a guitar. It was a guitar case

full of weapons that he uses on his

victims. Adios, I'm gonna take a nap. And

thanks for the drink.

(CONTINUED)

26.

MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)

If you see this guy, call us.

DOMINO

(friendly)

I thought I told you not to touch

anything.

MARIACHI

Sorry. I needed to relax. I can...

DOMINO

(smiling)

No, it's alright, Finish up. Do you want

shampoo?

MARIACHI

(laying back, closed eyes)

Yes, please.

DOMINO

Who are you?!

MARIACHI

(choking)

I'm a musician!

(CONTINUED)

27.

DOMINO

What do you have in here? GUNS? KNIVES?

MARIACHI

No! My guitar!

DOMINO

We'll see...

DOMINO (CONT'D)

You're very modest, Mariachi...

DOMINO (CONT'D)

(through gritted teeth)

You told me you killed four men, when you

really killed seven. Or were they still

breathing even after you shot out their

hearts?

MARIACHI

(groing dizzy)

I'm a mariachi...

MARIACHI

... not a murderer...

DOMINO

Aren't you going to watch?

(CONTINUED)

28.

MARIACHI

I told you... I am a musician.

DOMINO

Play it.

MARIACHI

(still choking)

W...w...what?

DOMINO

Play it, damnit, play something sweet!!!

DOMINO (CONT'D)

(growing impatient)

MARIACHI

(in a high sweet voice)

What is this place? That treats me like a

murderer? They've all got their heads up

their butts... Even this beautiful girl,

With a knife to my balls, Should I kiss

her or hit her... Or both?

(CONTINUED)

29.

DOMINO

You're a mariachi, all right. And a good

one.

MARIACHI

I think this is the best I've ever

played. You... inspired me.

MARIACHI (CONT'D)

Hire me.

MARIACHI (CONT'D)

I'm good. Hire me to play in your bar.

I'll work mostly from tips. But, I need

steady work.

DOMINO

I couldn't pay you. I have no money.

MARIACHI

This fancy place and you have no money?

DOMINO

It's the truth.

MARIACHI

I'll work for room and board, then.

Please, I'm desperate.

DOMINO

(thinking)

Will I have to keep a knife at your balls

to get you to play like that?

MARIACHI

(smiling)

Not if you're paying me room and board.

Please... until I find a permanent job.

DOMINO

(thinking)

You won't find a permanent job in this

town... but OK.

(CONTINUED)

30.

DOMINO (CONT'D)

You're going to need a better sense of

humor than that, if you're gonna work for

me, kid.

GIRL #1

(into phone)

Yes? One moment please...

(CONTINUED)

31.

AZUL

(into phone)

Yeah.

MOCO

(into phone)

Amigo! I'm glad I've reached you! You've

not answered all day. Killing ten of my

men must have been very time consuming!

AZUL

(into phone)

Six.

MOCO

(into phone)

What?

AZUL

(into phone)

I've only killed six! You were always bad

at math, Moco. I guess that's why you

never paid me half of the money. You

thought it all belonged to you.

MOCO

(into phone)

I knew half was yours... I got greedy, my

friend. It's my nature. But you!!! You

are modest! You've killed ten of my men!!

I know, because I'm having them buried in

my yard right now. With my dogs and cats.

AZUL

(counting on his fingers, into

phone)

I killed six. But don't bother counting

so soon. The number will triple by

tomorrow.

MOCO

(into phone)

I'm sorry things turned out this way. My

friend. I got greedy. I should never have

tried to kill you. It would have been

cheaper for me to pay you. Now I've got

to find ten new men.

(CONTINUED)

32.

AZUL

(into phone)

Six.

MOCO

(into phone)

Ten.

AZUL

(into phone)

I tell you what. You give me my money,

and I won't kill any more of your men...

And I won't kill you.

MOCO

(takes a sip, into phone)

No, it's too late for that. We're going

to have to see this through.

AZUL

(into phone)

Just like the Moco I used to know. Still

wearing white?

MOCO

(looking down at his clothes,

into phone)

What do you think?

AZUL

(into phone)

I think you should change clothes. I'd

hate to ruin a white suit with your

stupid blood.

MARIACHI

I need to get my money back from that

hotel. I'll be right back.

DOMINO

Are you crazy? If you go anywhere with

that jacket and that case you could be

killed. Leave that stuff here.

(CONTINUED)

33.

MARIACHI

I never go anywhere without it. Take care

of it.

DOMINO

(dolly in slow, into phone)

Hi. It's Domino.

MOCO

(into phone)

I know who it is...

(CONTINUED)

34.

ASSISTANT

Can I get something to drink or eat?

AZUL

One beer.

AZUL (CONT'D)

In a bottle, wey.

ASSISTANT

(laughs)

Sorry.

AZUL

(looking around)

Isn't there a girl that works here?

ASSISTANT

Yeah, she owns the place.

AZUL

(heading a few bills to the

Assistant)

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

35.

AZUL (CONT'D)

She owns it, now? Then she is Moco's

girl?

ASSISTANT

(looking around)

So-so. She's onto this new musician.

AZUL

Thank you.

MARIACHI

I just saw a guy with a guitar case like

mine. It's him they want.

DOMINO

(to Assistant)

Did he say anything?

ASSISTANT

(nodding)

No, he just ordered a drink.

MARIACHI

I don't look anything like him...

MEAN DUDE #5

I'm not sure...

36.

MEAN DUDE #5

What's in the case?

AZUL

My guitar.

MEAN DUDE #5

Yeah? You're one of those old-time

mariachis, huh?

AZUL

(pause)

Yes.

MEAN DUDE #5

OK, let's take a look.

MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)

If it's a guitar like you say it is,

we'll never bother you again...

MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)

If it's not...

MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)

... then we'll spray paint this street

with your brains.

MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)

(walking away)

Sorry....

(CONTINUED)

37.

DOMINO

Look, as long as you don't carry the case

around, they'll leave you alone. It's

that guy they're after.

MARIACHI

(putting on his coat)

I better put this upstairs...

DOMINO

What's wrong?

38.

MEAN DUDE #5

That's him...

MEAN DUDE #5

That's him...

39.

RAT #1

I'm sorry we left...

RAT #2

... We didn't know what to do...

RAT #1

... We figured you could defend

yourself!!!

AZUL

You thought I could defend myself...

AZUL

... against three armed men...

AZUL

... using this?

AZUL (CONT'D)

My case got switched with some maricon

mariachi!

(CONTINUED)

40.

RAT #1

Where is this mariachi?

AZUL

He's dead by now... So, I want you to go

look for my case.

AZUL (CONT'D)

Leave me a weapon.

AZUL (CONT'D)

That was disloyal of you to leave me out

there. You should be as loyal to me as

you are to each other.

AZUL (CONT'D)

Are you loyal?

RAT #2

(after glancing at Rat #1)

Yes.

AZUL

(to Rat #1)

Are you loyal?

RAT #2

Yes.

AZUL

Then shoot him.

AZUL (CONT'D)

You are loyal, are you not? SHOOT HIM. Or

I shoot you.

RAT #1

I can't.

(CONTINUED)

41.

AZUL

Why not?

RAT #1

You said we should be as loyal to you as

we are to each other. I couldn't shoot

him, for that would be as disloyal as

shooting you.

AZUL

Very good. Now go find my case.

MARIACHI

Where were you when he came into the bar?

DOMINO

I was on the phone, talking to a friend

that knows what's going on.

MARIACHI

Did you mention me?

DOMINO

No... He told me the man in black is

Azul.

MARIACHI

If his name is Azul, why doesn't he wear

blue?

DOMINO

I don't know... Anyway, he's killing the

men of the town drug dealer. The dealer's

name is Mauricio. But he's known as Moco.

MARIACHI

And Moco is sending these men to find

Azul. So, why do they chase me?

(CONTINUED)

42.

DOMINO

They have never seen Azul... only Moco

knows him. My friend says the description

Moco gave his men was that he wears

black, and carries a guitar case. Sounds

like you, no?

MARIACHI

Couldn't you tell your friend that there

are two people like that in his town? One

is a killer, and one is a mariachi.

DOMINO

Only special people can talk to Moco.

Besides, you've killed a few of his men,

now. Your best option is to keep out of

sight, stop wearing black, and to hide

that stupid case until this is all over.

MEAN DUDE #5

He got away... but I got a good look at

him.

MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)

Coca, Caca, Beto were killed.

MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)

He won't get away again, Moco. I promise.

MARIACHI

Are you always closed Monday nights, or

did you close since I can't play my

guitar tonight?

(CONTINUED)

43.

DOMINO

Mondays are my day off. Want to play a

game?

MARIACHI

Sure.

DOMINO

(into phone)

Hello?

MOCO

(into phone)

Come see me.

DOMINO

(into phone)

I can't.

MOCO

(into phone)

Please.

DOMINO

(into phone)

I don't feel well. I've got to go.

MOCO

(into phone)

Have you ridden the bike?

DOMINO

(into phone)

No... I've got to go...

MARIACHI

Boyfriend.

DOMINO

(quiet as if thinking)

No...

(CONTINUED)

44.

MARIACHI

I can't figure out something. You tell me

you're poor. Poor family. Yet you've got

this place.

DOMINO

(sighing)

This place is a gift.

MARIACHI

From who?

DOMINO

From Mauricio.

MARIACHI

From Mauricio? The man trying to kill me?

DOMINO

He's not trying to kill you, his man had

you confused with Azul.

MARIACHI

Same thing.

DOMINO

Look, you now how if you want to impress

a girl, you send her flowers, candy,

jewelry until you win her love?

MARIACHI

Yes.

DOMINO

If one present doesn't work, you keep

sending bigger and better things until

you win her or you're broke?

MARIACHI

Correct...

DOMINO

Well, Mauricio sent me flowers, then

jewelry, then he gave me a job at his

saloon, then he gave me the whole

saloon... etc.

MARIACHI

He's still giving you things?

DOMINO

He'll never run out of money.

(CONTINUED)

45.

MARIACHI

And you accept it all? What's the last

thing he sent you?

DOMINO

A motorcycle.

DOMINO (CONT'D)

He wants me to ride out to his ranch when

I've decided to be his. He thinks he's

close to having me.

MARIACHI

Is he?

DOMINO

(pause)

He was.

DOMINO (CONT'D)

Not anymore.

MARIACHI

So, you really are from a poor family.

DOMINO

(in the dark)

I remember when I was growing up, we were

so poor, that my brothers and sisters and

I all slept on the same blanket stretched

out across the floor. We had to sleep in

a circle, with our fingers in each

other's ears, to keep the bugs from

crawling into them.

MARIACHI

(after a pause)

Ay, wey...

46.

DOMINO

Here's a little bit I've saved. I want

you to go get a new guitar.

DOMINO (CONT'D)

Take it, stupid. I'm not saying go by the

best one, just a temporary one so you can

play again tonight.

MEAN DUDE #5

That's him...

MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)

(into walkie-talkie)

Loco, he's headed your way... black

pants, white shirt.

47.

MEAN DUDE #5

(into walkie-talkie)

Where did he go, Loco?

LOCO

(laughs, into walkie-talkie)

He got in my truck.

MEAN DUDE #5

(into walkie-talkie)

Take him around the block.

48.

MOCO

That's not him.

AZUL

Where's my case?

RAT #1

We couldn't find it.

RAT #2

We heard they caught you and were taking

you to Moco's ranch.

RAT #1

... so we came to see if it was true.

AZUL

They caught the mariachi.

(CONTINUED)

49.

DOMINO

What can I get you?

AZUL

One beer.

DOMINO

Anything else?

AZUL

(nodding)

My guitar case.

DOMINO

Where's Mariachi?

AZUL

Where's my case?

DOMINO

Upstairs.

(CONTINUED)

50.

AZUL

Get it.

AZUL (CONT'D)

If you want your mariachi back, come with

me.

DOMINO

Why will you help me?

AZUL

Because you know where Moco's ranch is...

I don't.

AZUL (CONT'D)

You help me, I'll help you.

DOMINO

Let's go.

DOMINO

(over the gate)

Mauricio!!

AZUL

Play along...

(CONTINUED)

51.

AZUL (CONT'D)

Open the gate or she's dead!

MOCO

(to Domino)

I'm sorry he used you to get to me,

Domino.

MOCO (CONT'D)

Azul, let her go and you'll get your

money.

AZUL

Moco, give me my money or I ruin your

clothes with her blood.

DOMINO

What have you done with Mariachi?

MOCO

Who?

DOMINO

The musician your men confused with Azul.

MOCO

(staring at her)

So that's why you were busy that night...

MOCO (CONT'D)

... you had that little monkey climbing

all over you.

AZUL

Give me my money or I kill her NOW!!!

MOCO

After all I've done for you, this is how

you treat me?

DOMINO

I never asked you for anything until now.

Let Mariachi go.

(CONTINUED)

52.

AZUL

I swear I'll kill her!

MOCO

No you won't. I will.

AZUL

All I wanted was my rightful share. But

you've got to kill everybody.

MOCO

You feel sorry for her, don't you? See,

that's why you can't ever be as big as

me.

MOCO (CONT'D)

(aiming gun)

Because you have too much heart.

MARIACHI

Stop here.

MARIACHI

Domino!!! We're leaving!!! Right now!!!

(CONTINUED)

53.

ASSISTANT

She's gone.

MARIACHI

Where is she?

ASSISTANT

Looking for you.

ASSISTANT (CONT'D)

She gave the case back to that guy. She

left with him to find you.

MOCO

Bring that musician out here so he can be

reunited with my Domino.

MEN

He's gone, sir.

MOCO

Find him!!

(CONTINUED)

54.

MOCO (CONT'D)

(good shot)

So you're the little mariachi that came

to town, killed my men, and stole my

girl...

MOCO (CONT'D)

You are very talented.

MOCO (CONT'D)

I bet you play the guitarra real well,

huh?

MOCO (CONT'D)

(raising gun)

Not anymore.

MOCO (CONT'D)

Now get the hell off my property and take

your hand with you!!!

FADE OUT
