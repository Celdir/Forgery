TRUE GRIT

Adaptation by

Joel and Ethan Coen

Based on the Novel by Charles Portis

June 12, 2009

Voice-Over

People do not give it credence that a young girl could leave

home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her father's

blood, but it did happen.

I was just fourteen years of age when a coward by the name

of Tom Chaney shot my father down in Fort Smith,

Arkansas, and robbed him of his life and his horse and two

California gold pieces that he carried in his trouser band.

Papa was a Cumberland Presbyterian and a Mason. He'd

hired Chaney--for paid wages, not on shares--when Chaney

was "down on his luck." If Papa had a failing it was his

kindly disposition; I did not get my mean streak from him.

He had taken Chaney up to Fort Smith to help lead back a

string of mustang ponies he'd just bought from a stock trader

named Stonehill. In town, Chaney had fallen to drink and

cards, and lost all his money. He got it into his head he'd

been cheated and went back to the boarding house for his

Henry rifle. Papa remonstrated, and Chaney shot him in the

breast.

2

Chaney fled. He could have taken the time to saddle the

horse--or hitched up three spans of mules to a Concord

stagecoach and smoked a pipe, as it seems that no one in that

city was inclined to give chase. Chaney had mistaken its

citizens for men.

Voice-Over

You might say, what business was it of my father's to

meddle? My answer is this: he was trying to do that short

devil a good turn. He was his brother's keeper. Does that

answer your question?

Voice

(Irish-accented)

Is that the man?

Yarnell

Lord lord.

Mattie

That is my father.

Yarnell

Well I'm not sure I--

Mattie

Tell mama not to sign anything until I return home and see

that Papa is buried in his mason's apron.

. . .Your terms are agreeable if I may pass the night here.

Undertaker

Here? Among these people?

Mattie

These people?

Undertaker

I am expecting three more souls. Sullivan, Smith, and His

Tongue In The Rain.

Mattie

How is it that you know in advance?

Man

Ladies and gentlemen beware and train up your children in

the way that they should go! You see what has become of

me because of drink. I killed a man in a trifling quarrel over

a pocketknife.

5

Man

If I had received good instruction as a child I would be with

my wife and children today, away out on the Cimarron

River. I don't know what is to become of them. I hope and

pray that you will not slight them and compel them to go into

low company.

Mattie

Can you point out the sheriff?

Woman

Him with the mustaches.

Man

Well, I killed the wrong man is the which-of-why I'm here.

Had I killed the man I meant to I don't believe I would a

been convicted. I see men out there in that crowd is worse

than me.

. . . Okay.

Indian

I would like to say--

6

Crowd

Oh!

Man

Oh, Sullivan must'er lost weight in prison! His neck ain't

broke!

Voice

Hot tamales?

. . . Ten cents?

Sheriff

No, we ain't arrested him. Ain't caught up to him, he lit out

for the Territory. I would think he has throwed in with

Lucky Ned Pepper, whose gang robbed a mail hack

yesterday on the Poteau River.

Mattie

Why are you not looking for him?

Sheriff

I have no authority in the Indian Nation. Tom Chaney is the

business of the U.S. marshals now.

Mattie

When will they arrest him?

Sheriff

Not soon I am afraid. The marshals are not well staffed and,

I will tell you frankly, Chaney is at the end of a long list of

7

fugitives and malefactors.

Mattie

Could I hire a marshal to pursue Tom Chaney?

Sheriff

You have a lot of experience with bounty hunters?

Mattie

My answer is this: That is a silly question. I am here to

settle my father's affairs.

Sheriff

All alone?

Mattie

I am the person for it. Mama was never any good at sums

and she can hardly spell cat. I intend to see papa's killer

hanged.

Sheriff

I see. Well. Nothing prevents you from offering a reward,

or from so informing a marshal. It would have to be real

money, though, to be persuasive. Chaney is across the river

in the Choctaw Nation--lawless country. It will not be a

daisy-picking expedition. Upwards of three-score US

marshals have been slaughtered in the Territory.

Mattie

I will see to the money. Who's the best marshal?

Sheriff

I would have to weigh that proposition. I reckon William

Waters is the best tracker. He is half Comanche and it is

something to see him cut for sign. The meanest one is

Rooster Cogburn. He is a pitiless man, double tough and

fear don't enter into his thinking. He loves to pull a cork.

The best is probably L.T. Quinn, he brings his prisoners in

alive. He may let one get by now and again but he believes

even the worst of men is entitled to a fair shake. Quinn is a

good peace officer and a lay preacher to boot. He will not

plant evidence or abuse a prisoner. He is as straight as

string. Yes, I will say Quinn is about the best they have.

8

Mattie

Where can I find this Rooster?

Voice

The jakes is occupied.

Mattie

I know it is occupied Mr. Cogburn. As I said, I have

business with you.

Voice

I have prior business.

Mattie

You have been at it for quite some time, Mr. Cogburn.

Voice

(roaring drunk)

There is no clock on my business! To hell with you! To hell

with you! How did you stalk me here?!

Mattie

The sheriff told me to look in the saloon. In the saloon they

referred me here. We must talk.

Voice

(outraged)

Women ain't allowed in the saloon!

Mattie

I was not there as a customer. I am fourteen years old.

9

Voice

(sullen)

The jakes is occupied. And will be for some time.

Ross

Yell County

Hold at station

Undertaker

You can sleep in a coffin if you loik.

Mattie

Not. . . yet.

10

Col. G. Stonehill. Licensed Auctioneer. Cotton Factor.

Mattie

How much are you paying for cotton?

Stonehill

Nine and a half for low middling and ten for ordinary.

Mattie

We got most of ours out early and sold it to Woodson

Brothers in Little Rock for eleven cents.

Stonehill

Then I suggest you take the balance of it to the Woodson

Brothers.

Mattie

We took the balance to Woodson. We got ten and a half.

Stonehill

Why did you come here to tell me this?

Mattie

I thought we might shop around up here next year but I guess

we are doing all right in Little Rock. I am Mattie Ross,

daughter of Frank Ross.

Stonehill

A tragic thing. May I say your father impressed me with his

manly qualities. He was a close trader but he acted the

gentleman.

11

Mattie

I propose to sell those ponies back to you that my father

bought.

Stonehill

That, I fear, is out of the question. I will see that they are

shipped to you at my earliest convenience.

Mattie

We don't want the ponies now. We don't need them.

Stonehill

Well that hardly concerns me. Your father bought those five

ponies and paid for them and there is an end of it. I have the

bill of sale.

Mattie

And I want three hundred dollars for Papa's saddle horse that

was stolen from your stable.

Stonehill

You will have to take that up with the man who stole the

horse.

Mattie

Tom Chaney stole the horse while it was in your care. You

are responsible.

Stonehill

I admire your sand but I believe you will find that I am not

liable for such claims.

Mattie

You were custodian. If you were a bank and were robbed

you could not simply tell the depositors to go hang.

Stonehill

I do not entertain hypotheticals, the world as it is is vexing

enough. Secondly, your valuation of the horse is high by

about two hundred dollars. How old are you?

12

Mattie

If anything my price is low. Judy is a fine racing mare. She

has won purses of twenty-five dollars; I have seen her jump

an eight-rail fence with a heavy rider. I am fourteen.

Stonehill

Hmm. Well, that's all very interesting. The ponies are

yours, take them. Your father's horse was stolen by a

murderous criminal. I had provided reasonable protection

for the creature as per our implicit agreement. My watchman

had his teeth knocked out and can take only soup. We must

each bear his own misfortunes.

Mattie

I will take it to law.

Stonehill

You have no case.

Mattie

Lawyer J. Noble Daggett of Dardanelle, Arkansas may think

otherwise--as might a jury, petitioned by a widow and three

small children.

Stonehill

Where is your mother?

Mattie

She is at home in Yell County looking after my sister

Victoria and my brother Little Frank.

Stonehill

I cannot make an agreement with a minor child. You are not

accountable.

Mattie

Lawyer Dagget will back up any decision I make, you may

rest easy on that score. You can confirm any agreement by

telegraph.

Stonehill

I will pay two hundred dollars to your father's estate when I

have in my hand a letter from your lawyer absolving me of

13

Mattie

Stonehill

Stonehill

Mattie

Stonehill

Mattie

Stonehill

Mattie

14

Stonehill

A what? All right, now listen very carefully as I will not

bargain further. I will take the ponies back and keep the gray

horse which is mine and settle for three hundred dollars.

Now you must take that or leave it and I do not much care

which it is.

Mattie

Lawyer Daggett would not wish me to consider anything

under three hundred twenty-five dollars. But I will settle for

three hundred and twenty if I am given the twenty in

advance. And here is what I have to say about the saddle--

Mrs. Floyd

Frank Ross's daughter. My poor child. My poor child.

Mattie

You have my father's traps?

Mrs. Floyd

Oh yes we do. My poor child. Are you gawna be stayin

with us or are you hurrying home to your mother?

Mattie

I am staying briefly. I have business with Marshal Rooster

Cogburn. I found him in his cups today but I understand

he's to be in court tomorrow, testifying. I mean to engage

him to hunt down Tom Chaney.

15

Mrs. Floyd

Well god bless him for that. The tariff here is seventy-five

cents for room and supper. That does not include your

daytime eats.

Mattie

Very well.

Mrs. Floyd

Your father owed for two days, god bless him.

Mattie

Oh. Well.

Mrs. Floyd

You'll share a room with Grandma Turner. We've had to

double up, what with all the people in town come to see the

hanging Judge Parker's put on for us.

Mattie

Yes, I witnessed the hanging myself.

Mrs. Floyd

Was it a good'n?

Mrs. Floyd

This was in the poor man's room. This is everything, there

are no light fingers in this house. If you need something for

to tote the gun around I will give you an empty flour sack for

a nickel.

16

Cogburn

The woman was out in the yard dead with blowflies on her

face and the old man was inside with his breast blowed open

by a scatter-gun and his feet burned. He was still alive but

just was. He said them two Wharton boys had done it, rode

up drunk--

Mr. Goudy

Objection. Hearsay.

Mr. Barlow

Dying declaration, your honor.

Judge

Overruled. Procede, Mr. Cogburn.

Cogburn

Them two Wharton boys--that'd be Odus and C.C.--

throwed down on him, asked him where his money was,

when he wouldn't talk lit pine knots and held 'em to his feet.

He told 'em in a fruit jar under a gray rock at one corner of

the smokehouse.

I never shot nobody I didn't have to.

Mr. Goudy

That was not the question. How many?

Cogburn

. . . Shot or killed?

Mr. Goudy

Let us restrict it to "killed" so that we may have a

manageable figure.

Cogburn

Around twelve or fifteen. Stopping men in flight, defending

myself, et cetera.

Mr. Goudy

Around twelve or fifteen. So many that you cannot keep a

precise count. Remember, you are under oath. I have

examined the records and can supply the accurate figure.

Cogburn

I believe them two Whartons make twenty-three.

Mr. Goudy

Twenty-three dead men in four years.

Cogburn

It is a dangerous business.

Mr. Goudy

How many members of this one family, the Wharton family,

have you killed?

Cogburn

Immediate, or--

Mr. Barlow

Your honor, perhaps counsel should be advised that the

marshal is not the defendant in this action.

Cogburn

Why would I do that?

Mr. Goudy

You did not drag his body over to the fire? Fling his arm in?

Cogburn

No sir.

Mr. Goudy

Two witnesses who arrived on the scene will testify to the

location of the body. You do not remember moving the

body? So it was a bushwack, as he tended his campfire?

Mr. Barlow

Objection.

Cogburn

I, if that was where the body was I might have moved him. I

do not remember.

Mr. Goudy

Why would you move the body, Mr. Cogburn?

Cogburn

Them hogs rooting around might have moved him. I do not

remember.

Cogburn

Son of a goddamn bitch.

Mattie

Rooster Cogburn?

Cogburn

What is it.

24

Mattie

I would like to talk with you a minute.

Cogburn

What is it.

Mattie

They tell me you are a man with true grit.

Cogburn

What do you want, girl? Speak up. It is suppertime.

Mattie

Let me do that.

. . . Your makings are too dry. I am looking for the man who

shot and killed my father, Frank Ross, in front of the

Monarch boarding house. The man's name is Tom Chaney.

They say he is over in Indian Territory and I need somebody

to go after him.

Cogburn

What is your name, girl?

Mattie

My name is Mattie Ross. We are located in Yell County.

My mother is at home looking after my sister Victoria and

my brother Little Frank.

Cogburn

You had best go home to them. They will need help with the

churning.

Mattie

There is a fugitive warrant out for Chaney. The government

will pay you two dollars for bringing him in plus ten cents a

mile for each of you. On top of that I will pay you a fifty-

dollar reward.

25

Cogburn

What are you? (looks at the flour sack she holds) What've

you got there in your poke?

. . . By God! A Colt's dragoon! Why, you're no bigger than

a corn nubbin, what're you doing with a pistol like that?

Mattie

I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it if the law fails to do so.

Cogburn

Well, that piece will do the job--if you can find a high

stump to rest it on and a wall to put behind you.

Mattie

Nobody here knew my father and I am afraid nothing much

is going to be done about Chaney except I do it. My brother

is a child and my mother is indecisive and hobbled by grief.

Cogburn

I don't believe you have fifty dollars.

Mattie

I will shortly. I have a contract with Colonel Stonehill which

he will make payment on tomorrow or the next day, once a

lawyer countersigns.

Cogburn

I don't believe fairy tales or sermons or stories about money,

baby sister. But thank you for the cigarette.

26

Landlady

Isn't your mother expecting you home, dear? I did not think

to see you this evening.

Mattie

My business is not yet finished. Mrs. Floyd, have any rooms

opened up? Grandma Turner. . . the bed is quite narrow.

Landlady

The second-floor back did open up but the gentleman on the

porch has just taken it. But don't worry yourself, dear--you

are not disturbing Grandma Turner.

Cowboy

You are sleeping the day away.

27

Mattie

I am not well.

Cowboy

You do not look well. My name is LeBoeuf. I have just

come from Yell County.

Mattie

We have no rodeo clowns in Yell County.

LeBoeuf

A saucy line will not get you far with me. I saw your mother

yesterday morning. She says for you to come right on home.

Mattie

Hm. What was your business there?

LeBoeuf

This is a man I think you know.

. . . You called him Tom Chaney, I believe. . .

. . . though in the months I have been tracking him he has

used the names Theron Chelmsford, John Todd Andersen,

and others. He dallied in Monroe, Louisiana, and Pine Bluff,

Arkansas before turning up at your father's place.

Mattie

Why did you not catch him in Monroe, Louisiana or Pine

Bluff, Arkansas?

28

LeBoeuf

He is a crafty one.

Mattie

I thought him slow-witted myself.

LeBoeuf

That was his act.

Mattie

It was a good one. Are you some kind of law?

LeBoeuf

That's right. I am a Texas Ranger.

Mattie

That may make you a big noise in that state; in Arkansas you

should mind that your Texas trappings and title do not make

you an object of fun. Why have you been ineffectually

pursuing Chaney?

LeBoeuf

He shot and killed a state senator named Bibbs down in

Waco, Texas. The Bibbs family have put out a reward.

Mattie

How came Chaney to shoot a state senator?

LeBoeuf

My understanding is there was an argument about a dog. Do

you know anything about where Chaney has gone?

Mattie

He is in the Territory, and I hold out little hope for you

earning your bounty.

LeBoeuf

Why is that?

Mattie

My man will beat you to it. I have hired a deputy marshal,

29

the toughest one they have, and he is familiar with the Lucky Ned Pepper

gang that they say Chaney has tied up with.

LeBoeuf

Well, I will throw in with you and your marshal.

Mattie

No. Marshal Cogburn and I are fine.

LeBoeuf

It'll be to our mutual advantage. Your marshal I presume

knows the Territory; I know Chaney. It is at least a two-man

job taking him alive.

Mattie

When Chaney is taken he is coming back to Fort Smith to

hang. I am not having him go to Texas to hang for shooting

some senator.

LeBoeuf

Haw-haw! It is not important where he hangs, is it?

Mattie

It is to me. Is it to you?

LeBoeuf

It means a great deal of money to me. It's been many

months' work.

Mattie

I'm sorry that you are paid piecework not on wages, and that

you have been eluded the winter long by a halfwit. Marshal

Cogburn and I are fine.

LeBoeuf

You give out very little sugar with your pronouncements.

While I sat there watching you I gave some thought to

stealing a kiss, though you are very young and sick and

unattractive to boot, but now I have a mind to give you five

or six good licks with my belt.

30

Mattie

One would be as unpleasant as the other. If you wet your

comb, it might tame that cowlick.

Landlady

Try some Dr. Underwood's. You may feel giddy but do not

be alarmed as that is only the medicine working.

Dr. Underwood's Bile Activator

Approved by Physicians and Clergymen

Landlady

I will charge you ten cents. It probably means a loss for me,

but it is hard to figure the exact proportion of the bottle. . .

31

32

Letter

Mattie. I wish you would leave these matters entirely to me,

or at the very least do me the courtesy of consulting me

before entering such agreements. I am not scolding you, but

I am saying your headstrong ways will lead you into a tight

corner one day. I trust the enclosed document will let you

conclude your business and return to Dardanelle. Your

mother is in a panic and begging me to fetch you back home.

Yours, J. Noble Dagget.

Mattie

I was as bad yesterday as you look today. I was forced to

share a bed with Grandma Turner.

Stonehill

I am not acquainted with Grandma Turner. If she is a

resident of this city it does not surprise me that she carries

disease. I was told this malarial place was to be the Chicago

of the Southwest. Well, my little friend, it is not the Chicago

of the Southwest. I cannot rightly say what it is, but it has

ruined my health as it has my finances.

33

. . . I owe you money.

Mattie

You have not traded poorly.

Stonehill

Certainly not. I am paying you for a horse I do not possess

and have bought back a string of useless ponies I cannot sell

again.

Mattie

You are forgetting the gray horse.

Stonehill

Crowbait.

Mattie

You are looking at the thing in the wrong light.

Stonehill

I am looking at it in the light of God's eternal truth.

Mattie

Your illness is putting you "down in the dumps." You will

soon find a buyer for the ponies.

Stonehill

I have a tentative offer of ten dollars per head from the

Pfitzer Soap Works of Little Rock.

Mattie

It would be a shame to destroy such spirited horseflesh.

Stonehill

So it would. I am confident the deal will fall through.

Mattie

Look here. I need a pony. I will pay ten dollars for one of

them.

34

Stonehill

No. That was lot price. No no. Wait a minute. Are we

trading again? I just handed you twenty dollars each for

those ponies and you now propose to buy one back for ten?

Little girl: I will give you ten dollars to refrain from doing

any more business here. It would be the most astute deal I

have struck in Arkansas.

Mattie

This one is beautiful.

Stableboy

He don't know they's a person up there. You too light.

Stableboy

He thinks he got a horsefly on him.

35

Mattie

He is very spirited. I will call him "Little Blackie."

Stableboy

Das a good name.

Mattie

What does he like for a treat?

Stableboy

Ma'am, he is a horse, so he likes apples.

Mattie

Thank Mr. Stonehill for me.

Stableboy

No ma'am. . . I ain't s'posed to utter your name.

Chinese

See. Sleep.

Mattie

That is fine. I will wake him.

Chinese

Won't like.

36

Mattie

Mr. Cogburn, it is I. Mattie Ross, your employer.

Rooster

Whuh.

Mattie

How long til you are ready to go?

Rooster

Go whar?

Mattie

Into the Indian Territory. In pursuit of Tom Chaney.

Rooster

Whah. . .

. . . Oh.

. . . Chaney. You are the bereaved girl with stories of El

Dorado. Mr. Lee! Why are you admitting callers!

Grocer

Toad her no good!

Mattie

I said fifty dollars to retrieve Chaney. You did not believe

me?

37

Rooster

Well, I did not know. You are a hard one to figure.

Mattie

How long for you to make ready to depart?

Rooster

Well now wait now, sis. I remember your offer but do not

remember agreeing to it. If I'm going up against Ned

Pepper I will need a hundred dollars. I can tell you that

much. Hundred dollars! I am not pursuing his gang through

Arkansas, where there is law, and the criminal is out of his

element. They are in the Territory, in their element, where

there is no law and the marshal stands alone.

. . . Hundred dollars is the right amount. I will take those

fifty dollars in advance. There will be expenses.

Mattie

You are trying to take advantage of me.

Rooster

I am giving you the children's rate. I am not a sharper, I am

an old man sleeping in a rope bed in a room behind a

Chinese grocery. I should burn this damn thing. It is no

good for my back, sister. I have nothing.

Mattie

You want to be kept in whiskey.

Rooster

I don't have to buy that, I confiscate it. I am an officer of the

court.

38

. . . Thank you. Hundred dollars. That is the rate.

Mattie

I shall not niggle. Can we depart this afternoon?

Rooster

We?!

. . . You are not going. That is no part of it.

Mattie

You misjudge me if you think I am silly enough to give you

fifty dollars and simply watch you ride off.

Rooster

I am a bonded U.S. marshal!

Mattie

That weighs but little with me. I will see the thing done.

Rooster

You never said anything about this. I cannot go up against

Ned Pepper and a band of hard men and look after a baby at

the same time.

Mattie

I am not a baby.

Rooster

I will not be stopping at boarding houses with warm beds

and plates of hot grub on the table. It will be traveling fast

and eating light. What little sleeping is done will take place

on the ground.

Mattie

I have slept out at night. Papa took me and Little Frank coon

hunting last summer on the Petit Jean. We were in the

woods all night. We sat around a big fire and Yarnell told

ghost stories. We had a good time.

Rooster

Coon hunting! This ain't no coon hunt, it don't come within

forty miles of being a coon hunt!

39

Mattie

It is the same idea as a coon hunt. You are just trying to

make your work sound harder than it is. Here is the money.

I aim to get Tom Chaney and if you are not game I will find

somebody who is game. All I have heard out of you so far is

talk. I know you can drink whiskey and snore and spit and

wallow in filth and bemoan your station. The rest has been

braggadocio. They told me you had grit and that is why I

came to you. I am not paying for talk. I can get all the talk I

need and more at the Monarch Boarding House.

Rooster

Leave the money. Meet me here tomorrow morning at seven

o'clock and we will begin our coon hunt.

Mattie

Dearest Mother. I am about to embark on a great adventure.

Or dare I call it a mission, for shall any of us rest easy ere

Papa's death is avenged? My investigations in Fort Smith

lead me to believe that Tom Chaney can be found and

brought to justice, and I have made arrangements to that end.

I will return to you once I have seen them properly carried

through. . .

40

Mattie

But do not worry on my account. Though I walk through the

valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. The

author of all things watches over me. And I have a fine

horse. Kiss Little Frankie for me and pinch Violet's cheek.

I am off for the Choctaw Nation.

Mattie

Where is Marshal Cogburn!

Grocer

Went away. . .

Mattie

Away! Where?

Mattie

Here inside is a train ticket for your return home. Use it. By

the time you read this I will be across the river in the Indian

nation. Pursuit would be futile. I will return with your man

Chaney. Leave me to my work. Reuben Cogburn.

41

Mattie

Is that Marshal Cogburn?

Ferryman

That is the man.

Mattie

Who's he with?

Ferryman

I do not know.

Mattie

Take me across.

Ferryman

So you're the runaway. Marshal told me you'd show up.

I'm to present you to the sheriff.

Mattie

That is a story. Let go my horse. I have business across the

river.

. . . Look Slim, if you don't turn around and take me across

you may find yourself in court where you don't want to be. I

have a good lawyer.

Ferryman

Name ain't Slim.

42

Mattie

Run, Little Blackie!

Ferryman

Hey!

Mattie

Good, Little Blackie!

43

Rooster

That's quite a horse.

. . . I will give you ten dollars for him.

Mattie

From the money you stole from me?

Rooster

That was not stolen. I'm out for your man.

Mattie

I was to accompany you. If I do not, there is no agreement

and my money was stolen.

LeBoeuf

Marshal, put this child back on the ferry. We have a long

road, and time is a-wasting.

Mattie

If I go back, it is to the office of the U.S. marshals to report

the theft of my money. And futile, Marshal Cogburn--

"Pursuit would be futile"?--is not spelt f-u-d-e-l.

44

LeBoeuf

Little sister, it is time for your spanking.

Mattie

Help me, Marshal!

LeBoeuf

(still spanking)

Now you do as the grown-ups say! Or I will get myself a

birch switch and stripe your leg!

LeBoeuf

Now we will see what tune you sing!

Mattie

Are you going to let him do this, Marshal?

Rooster

No, I don't believe I will. Put your switch away, LeBoeuf.

She has got the best of us.

LeBoeuf

She has not got the best of me!

Rooster

(evenly)

Did you not hear me? That will do, I said.

45

LeBoeuf

I aim to finish what I started.

Rooster

That will be the biggest mistake you ever made, you Texas

brush-popper.

LeBoeuf

Hoorawed by a little girl.

LeBoeuf

I am not accustomed to so large a fire. In Texas, we will

make do with a fire of little more than twigs or buffalo chips

to heat the night's ration of beans.

. . . And, it is Ranger policy never to make your camp in the

same place as your cookfire. Very imprudent to make your

presence known in unsettled country.

. . . How do you know that Bagby will have intelligence?

46

Rooster

He has a store.

LeBoeuf

A store. That makes him an authority on movements in the

Territory?

Rooster

We have entered a wild place. Anyone coming in, wanting

any kind of supply, cannot pick and choose his portal.

LeBoeuf

That is a piece of foolishness. All the snakes are asleep this

time of year.

Rooster

They have been known to wake up.

Mattie

Let me have a rope too.

Rooster

A snake would not bother you.

. . . You are too little and bony. Before you sleep you should

fetch water for the morning and put it by the fire. The

creek'll ice over tonight.

Mattie

I am not going down there again. If you want any more

water you can fetch it yourself.

47

Rooster

Everyone in my party must do his job.

LeBoeuf

You are lucky to be traveling in a place where a spring is so

handy. In my country you can ride for days and see no

ground water. I have lapped filthy water from a hoofprint

and was glad to have it.

Rooster

If I ever meet one of you Texas waddies that says he never

drank water from a horse track I think I will shake his hand

and give him a Daniel Webster cigar.

LeBoeuf

You don't believe it?

Rooster

I believed it the first twenty-five times I heard it. Maybe it is

true. Maybe lapping water off the ground is Ranger policy.

LeBoeuf

You are getting ready to show your ignorance now, Cogburn.

I don't mind a little personal chaffing but I won't hear

anything against the Ranger troop from a man like you.

Rooster

How long have you boys been mounted on sheep down

there?

LeBoeuf

My shaggy horse will be galloping when that big American

stud of yours is winded and collapsed. Now make another

joke about it. You are only trying to put on a show for this

girl Mattie with what you must think is a keen tongue.

Rooster

This is like women talking.

LeBoeuf

Yes, that is the way! Make me out foolish in this girl's eyes.

48

Rooster

I think she has got you pretty well figured.

Mattie

Would you two like to hear the story of "The Midnight

Caller"? One of you will have to be "The Caller." I will tell

you what to say. I will do all the other parts myself.

Mattie

Good morning, Marshal.

Rooster

(eyes on his work)

Morning.

Mattie

Where is Mr. LeBoeuf?

Rooster

Down the hill. Performing his necessaries.

Mattie

Marshal Cogburn, I welcome the chance for a private parley.

I gather that you and Mr. LeBoeuf have come to some sort of

agreement. As your employer I believe I have a right to

know the particulars.

49

Rooster

The particulars is that we bring Chaney in to the magistrate

in San Saba Texas where they have a considerable reward on

offer. Which we split.

Mattie

I did not want him brought to Texas, to have Texas

punishment administered for a Texas crime. That was not

our agreement.

Rooster

What you want is to have him caught and punished.

Mattie

I want him to know he is being punished for killing my

father.

Rooster

You can let him know that. You can tell him to his face.

You can spit on him and make him eat sand out of the road.

I will hold him down. If you want I will flay the flesh off the

soles of his feet and find you an Indian pepper to rub into the

wound. Isn't that a hundred dollars' value?

Mattie

It is not. When I have bought and paid for something I will

have my way. Why do you think I am paying you if not to

have my way?

Rooster

It is time for you to learn you cannot have your way in every

little particular. Other people have their interests.

. . . I am a free agent. If you find I fail to satisfy your terms I

will return your money at the end of this expedition.

Mattie

Little Blackie and I are riding back to the U.S. marshals'

office. This is fraud.

50

Rooster

God damn it!

LeBoeuf

What's going on?

Rooster

(testy)

This is a business conversation.

LeBoeuf

Is that what you call it. It sounds to me like you are still

being hoorawed by a little girl.

Rooster

Did you say hooraw!

LeBoeuf

That was the word.

Rooster

I will show you hooraw!

Mattie

There is no hoorawing in it. My agreement with the Marshal

antedates yours. It has the force of law.

LeBoeuf

(amused)

The force of law! This man is a notorious thumper! He rode

by the light of the moon with Quantrill and Bloody Bill

Anderson!

Rooster

Those men was patriots, Texas trash!

LeBoeuf

They murdered women and children in Lawrence, Kansas.

Rooster

I have heard that too. It is a damned lie! What army was

you in, mister?

51

LeBoeuf

I was at Shreveport first with Kirby-Smith--

Rooster

What side was you on?

LeBoeuf

I was in the army of Northern Virginia, Cogburn, and I don't

have to hang my head when I say it!

Rooster

If you had served with Captain Quantrill--

LeBoeuf

Captain Quantrill indeed!

Rooster

You had best let this go, LeBoeuf!

LeBoeuf

Captain of what!

Rooster

Good, then! There are not sufficient dollars in the state of

Texas to make it worth my while to listen to your opinions,

day and night. Our agreement is nullified--it's each man for

himself!

LeBoeuf

That suits me!

. . . Congratulations, Cogburn. You have graduated from

marauder to wetnurse. Adios!

52

Mattie

We don't need him, do we Marshal?

Rooster

(muttering)

We'll miss his Sharp's carbine. It's apt to get lively out

here.

Indian Youth

Hey.

Rooster

Call that sport, do ya?

Rooster

Stay here sister. I will see Bagby.

Mattie

Has Chaney been here?

53

Rooster

No.

Rooster

But Coke Hayes was, two days ago. Coke runs with Lucky

Ned. He bought supplies, with this.

Mattie

This is Papa's gold piece! Tom Chaney, here we come!

Rooster

It is not the world's only California gold piece.

Mattie

They are rare, here.

Rooster

They are rare. But if it is Chaney's, it could just as easily

mean that Lucky Ned and his gang fell upon him, as that he

fell in with them. Chaney could be a corpse. These are a

rough lot.

Mattie

That would be a bitter disappointment, Marshal. What do

we do?

Rooster

We pursue. Ned is unfinished business for the marshals

anyhow, and when we have him we will also have Chaney

--or we can learn the whereabouts of his body. Bagby

doesn't know which way they went, but now we know they

come through here, they couldn't be going but one of two

ways: north toward the Winding Stair Mountains, or pushing

on further west. I suspect north. There is more to rob.

54

Youth

Mr. Ferrington will want to know who cut loose his mule.

Rooster

Tell him it was Mr. James, a bank examiner from Clay

County, Missouri.

Youth

The James boys is said to be slight, Frank and Jesse both.

Rooster

One of them has grown fat. The mule will not range far.

You boys mend your ways or I will return some dark night

and cut off one of your heads--I do not say which--and

leave it on the stomach of the other as a warning.

Rooster

Potter and I served with him at Elkhorn Tavern. Even

latterly our activities was by and large martial. We did

though, one time, run across a Yankee paymaster and relieve

him of four thousand dollars in gold coin. Squealed like it

was his own money. Well, since hostilities was officially

ended it was technically criminal so Potter rode down to

Arkansas and I went to Cairo Illinois with my share, started

calling myself Burroughs and opened an eating place called

The Green Frog. I married a grass widow but my drinking

picked up and my wife did not like the company of my river

friends. She decided to go back to her first husband, a clerk

in a hardware store. She said, "Goodbye, Reuben, a love for

decency does not abide in you." I told her, "Goodbye, Nola,

I hope that little nail-selling bastard will make you happy

this time." She took my boy with her too. He never did like

me anyhow. I guess I did speak awful rough to him but I did

not mean nothing by it. You would not want to see a

clumsier child than Horace. I bet he broke forty cups. . .

55

Rooster

Hey!

Rooster

Is it Chaney?

Mattie

I would not recognize the soles of his feet.

Rooster

Step back now.

Rooster

God damn it.

Rooster

Snagged. Well you are going to have to clamber on up with

this knife. I am too old and too fat.

56

Rooster

It had one billiard table, served ladies and men both but

mostly men. I tried to run it myself a while but I couldn't

keep good help and I never did learn how to buy meat. I was

like a man fighting bees. Finally I give up and solt it and

went out to see the country.

Rooster

You are doing well.

. . . That was when I went out to the staked plains of Texas

and shot buffalo with Vernon Shaftoe and a Flathead Indian

called Olly.

. . . The Mormons had run Shaftoe out of Great Salt Lake

City but don't ask me what it was for. Call it a misunder-

standing and let it go at that. There is no use in you asking

me questions about it, for I will not answer them.

. . . Is it our man?

57

Mattie

I believe not.

Rooster

No! Cut him down!

Mattie

Why?

Rooster

I might know him.

. . . You see, Olly and me both taken a solemn oath to keep

silent. Well sir, the big shaggies is about all gone. It is a

damned shame.

. . . I would give three dollars right now for a pickled buffalo

tongue.

Mattie

Why did they hang him so high?

Rooster

I don't know. Possibly in the belief it would make him more

dead.

58

Rooster

I do not know this man.

Mattie

He knew the hanged man?

59

Rooster

He did not. But it is a dead body, possibly worth something

in trade.

Rooster

She had taken a notion she wanted me to be a lawyer.

Bought a heavy book called Daniels on Negotiable

Instruments and set me to reading it. Never could get a grip

on it and I was happy enough to set it aside and leave Texas.

There ain't but about six trees between there and Canada,

and nothing else grows but has stickers on it. I went to--

Rooster

I knew it.

Mattie

Knew what?

Rooster

We're being followed. I asked the Indian to signal with a

shot if there was someone on our trail.

Mattie

Should we be concerned, Marshal?

Rooster

No. It's Mr. LeBoeuf, using us as bird dogs in hopes of

cutting in once we've flushed the prey. Our Texas friend has

got just enough sense to recognize he can't outtrack me.

60

Mattie

Perhaps we could double back over our tracks, and confuse

the trail in a clever way.

Rooster

No, we will wait right here and offer our friend a warm

hello, and ask him where he is going.

Rooster

You are not LeBoeuf.

Bear Man

My name is Forster. I practice dentistry in the Nation. Also,

veterinary arts. And medicine, on those humans that will sit

still for it.

61

Rooster

(indicating corpse)

You have your work cut out for you there.

Bear Man

Traded for him with an Indian, who said he came by him

honestly. I gave up two dental mirrors and a bottle of

expectorant. (beat) Do either of you need medical

attention?

Rooster

No.

. . . It is fixing to get cold. Do you know of any place to take

shelter?

Bear Man

I have my bearskin. You might want to head to the Original

Greaser Bob's. He notched a dugout into a hollow along the

Carrillon River. If you ride the river you won't fail to see it.

Greaser Bob--Original Greaser Bob--is hunting north of the

picket wire and would not begrudge its use.

Bear Man

I have taken his teeth. I will entertain an offer for the rest of

him.

Rooster

Take my jacket. Creep onto the roof. If they are not friendly

I will give you a sign to damp the chimney.

62

Man

Who is out there?

Rooster

We are looking for shelter.

Man

No room for you here! Ride on!

Rooster

Who all is in there?

Voice

Ride on!

63

Rooster

I am a Federal officer! Who is in there? Speak up and be

quick about it.

New Voice

A Methodist and a son-of-a-bitch!

Rooster

Is that Emmett Quincy?

New Voice

I don't know any Emmett Quincy.

Rooster

Listen here, Emmett Quincy. I know it is you! This is

Rooster Cogburn. Columbus Potter and five other marshals

is out here with me. We have got a bucket of coal oil. In

one minute we will burn you out from both ends! Chuck

your arms clear and come out with your hands locked on

your head and you will not be harmed. Oncet that coal oil

goes down the chimney we are killing everything that comes

out the door!

Quincy

There's only two of you!

Rooster

You go ahead and bet your life on it! How many of you is in

there?

Quincy

Me and Moon, but he is hit! He can't walk!

Rooster

Drag him out! Light that lamp!

64

Quincy

Tell them other officers to be careful with their guns! We

are coming out!

Rooster

Down in the snow! Lie still while I cuff you! We is only

two, but my man on the roof will shoot you if you get feisty.

Quincy

You said it was a man on the roof. I thought it was Potter.

Rooster

You was always dumb, Quincy, and remain true to form.

. . .This here's an awful lot of sofky. Was you boys looking

for company?

Quincy

That is our supper and breakfast both. I like a big breakfast.

Moon

Sofky always cooks up bigger than you think.

65

Rooster

And a good store of whiskey as well. What are you boys up

to, outside of cooking banquets? You are way too jumpy.

Quincy

We didn't know who was out there weather like this. It

might have been some crazy man. Anyone can say he is a

marshal.

Moon

My leg hurts.

Rooster

I'll bet it does. When is the last time you seen your old pard

Ned Pepper?

Quincy

Ned Pepper? I don't know him. Who is he?

Rooster

I'm surprised you don't remember him. He is a little fellow,

nervous and quick. His lip is all messed up.

Quincy

That don't bring anybody to mind.

Rooster

There is a new boy that might be running with Ned. He is

short himself and he has got a powder mark on his face, a

black place. He calls himself Chaney, or Chelmsford

sometimes. Carries a Henry rifle.

Quincy

That don't bring anybody to mind. Black mark, I would

remember that.

Rooster

You don't remember anything I want to know, do you

Quincy? I hope you don't mind. . .

66

. . . There seems to be ample. What do you know, Moon?

Moon

I don't know those boys. I always try to help out the law.

Rooster

By the time we get back to Fort Smith that leg will be

swelled up tight as Dick's hatband. It will be mortified and

they will cut it off. Then if you live I will get you two or

three years in the Federal house up in Detroit.

Moon

You are trying to get at me.

Rooster

They will teach you to read and write up there but the rest of

it won't be so good. Them boys can be hard on a gimp.

Moon

You are trying to get at me.

Rooster

You give me some good information on Ned and I will take

you to McAlester's store tomorrow get that ball taken out of

your leg. Then I will give you three days to clear the

Territory.

Quincy

We don't know those boys you are looking for.

Rooster

It ain't his leg.

Quincy

Don't go to flapping your mouth, Moon. It is best to let me

do the talking.

Moon

I would say if I knew. . .

67

Quincy

We are weary trappers.

. . . Who worked you over with the ugly stick?

Mattie

The man Chaney with the marked face killed my father. He

was a whiskey drinker like you and it led to killing in the

end. If you answer the marshal's questions he will help you.

I have a good lawyer at home and he will help you too.

Moon

I am puzzled by this. (to Rooster) Why is she here?

Quincy

Don't go jawing with these people, Moon. Don't go jawing

with that runt.

Mattie

(to Quincy)

I don't like you. I hope you go to jail. My lawyer will not

help you.

Moon

My leg is giving me fits.

Rooster

Yes, a young fellow like you don't want to loose his leg.

You are too young to be getting about on a willow peg. You

love dancing and sport, carrying on.

Quincy

Easy now. He is trying to get at you.

Rooster

I am getting at you with the truth.

Moon

We seen Ned and Haze two days ago. We's supposed--

68

Quincy

Don't act the fool! If you blow I will kill you!

Moon

I am played out. I must have a doctor. We's supposed--

Rooster

God damn it!

Moon

Oh lord, I am dying!

. . . Do something! Help me!

Rooster

I can do nothing for you, son. Your pard has killed you and I

have done for him.

Moon

Don't leave me lying here! Don't let the wolves rip me up!

Rooster

I'll see you are buried right. You tell me about Ned. Where

did you see him?

69

Moon

Two days ago at McAlester's store. They are coming here

tonight to get remounts, and sofky. They just robbed the

Katy Flyer at Wagoner's Switch if the snow didn't stop 'em.

. . . I am bleeding buckets! I am gone. Send the news to my

brother, George Garrett. He is a Methodist circuit rider in

South Texas. You can write care of the district supervisor in

Austin.

Rooster

Should I tell him you was outlawed up?

Moon

It don't matter, he knows I am on the scout. I will meet him

later walking the streets of Glory!

Rooster

Don't be looking for Quincy.

Rooster

Hobble our mounts in the corral out back. We don't know

when they's coming.

Mattie

Is he dead?

Rooster

He is. I stowed the bodies under the blanket there. Just

needs to look right enough to get 'em in the door.

70

. . . We'll climb that ridge there, fort up somewhere gives us

a clear shot.

Mattie

What was that?

Rooster

Fingers.

Mattie

What do we do now?

Rooster

We wait. They ride up, what we want is to get them all in

the dugout. I will kill the last one to go in and then we will

have them in a barrel.

Mattie

You will shoot him in the back?

Rooster

It will give them to know our intentions is serious. Then I

will call down and see if they will be taken alive. If they

won't I will shoot them as they come out. I am hopeful that

three of their party being dead will take the starch out of

them.

71

Mattie

You display great poise.

Rooster

It is just a turkey shoot. There was one time in New Mexico,

when Bo was a strong colt and I myself had less tarnish, we

was being pursued by seven men. I turned Bo around and

taken the reins in my teeth and rode right at them boys firing

them two navy sixes I carry on my saddle. Well I guess they

was all married men who loved their families as they

scattered and run for home.

Mattie

That is hard to believe.

Rooster

What is?

Mattie

One man riding at seven.

Rooster

It is true enough. You go for a man hard enough and fast

enough and he don't have time to think about how many is

with him--he thinks about himself and how he may get clear

of the wrath that is about to set down on him.

Mattie

Why were they pursuing you?

Rooster

They was in the nature of a posse.

Mattie

You were particeps criminis in something other than the case

of the Yankee paymaster?

Rooster

I robbed a high-interest bank. You can't rob a thief, can

you? I never robbed a citizen. Never took a man's watch.

72

Mattie

It is all stealing.

Rooster

That is the position they took in New Mexico.

. . . One man. I didn't figure them to send a scout.

. . . Damn. It is LeBoeuf.

LeBoeuf

Hello?

Mattie

We have to warn him, Marshal!

Rooster

Too late.

73

LeBoeuf

Oh!

Mattie

What do we do, Marshal?

Rooster

We sit. What does he do?

Rooster

He is a fine one for not drawing attention to himself.

Rooster

Him in the woolly chaps is Lucky Ned.

74

Rooster

Well, that's that.

75

Rooster

Well that didn't pan out.

Rooster

You managed to put a kink in my rope, pardner.

LeBoeuf

I am theverely injured.

Rooster

Yes you got drug some.

LeBoeuf

Altho shshot. By a rifle.

Rooster

That is quite possible. The scheme did not develop as I had

planned. You have been shot in the shoulder but the ball

passed through. It will pain you in the years to come. What

happened to your mouth?

LeBoeuf

I believe I beh mythelf.

76

Rooster

Couple of teeth missing and yes, the tongue is bit almost

through. Do you want to see if it will knit or should I just

yank it free? I know a teamster who bit his tongue off being

thrown from a horse. After a time he learned to make

himself more or less understood.

LeBoeuf

Hngnickh.

Rooster

What's that now?

LeBoeuf

Knit.

Rooster

Very well. It is impossible to bind a tongue wound. The

shoulder we will kit out.

. . . It's too bad. We just ran across a doctor of sorts but I do

not know where he was headed.

LeBoeuf

I thaw him too. Ith how I came to be here.

Mattie

Neither of these men are Chaney, Marshal.

Rooster

I know it. I know them both. The ugly one is Coke Hayes.

Him uglier still is Clement Parmalee. Parmalee and his

brothers have a silver claim in the Winding Stair Mountains

and I will bet you that's where Lucky Ned's gang is waiting.

We'll sleep here, follow in the morning.

Mattie

We promised to bury the poor soul inside.

77

Rooster

Ground is too hard. If these men wanted a decent burial they

should have got themselves kilt in summer.

Mattie

Sleep well, Little Blackie. . .

. . . I have a notion that tomorrow we will reach our object.

We are "hot on the trail". . .

. . . It seems that we will overtake Tom Chaney in the

Winding Stair Mountains. I would not want to be in his

shoes.

78

LeBoeuf

Azh I understand it, Chaney--or Chelmzhford, azh he called

himshelf in Texas--shot the shenator'zh dog. When the

shenator remonshtrated Chelmzhford shot him azh well.

You could argue that the shooting of the dog wazh merely an

inshtansh of malum prohibitum, but the shooting of a

shenator izh indubitably an inshtansh of malum in shay.

Rooster

Malla-men what?

Mattie

Malum in se. The distinction is between an act that is wrong

in itself, and an act that is wrong only according to our laws

and mores. It is Latin.

Rooster

I am struck that LeBoeuf is shot, trampled, and nearly severs

his tongue and not only does not cease to talk but spills the

banks of English.

LeBoeuf

(placidly)

I wuzh within three hundred yardzh of Chelmzhford once.

The closhesht I have been. With the Sharp'sh carbine, that

izh within range. But I wuzh mounted, and had the choish of

firing off-hand, or dishmounting to shoot from resht--which

would allow Chelmzhford to augment the dishtansh. I fired

mounted--and fired wide.

Rooster

. . . You could not hit a man at three hundred yards if the gun

was resting on Gibraltar.

79

LeBoeuf

The Sharp'sh carbine izh an inshtrument of uncanny power

and precizhun.

Rooster

I have no doubt that the gun is sound.

Rooster

That was "Johnny in the Low Ground." There are very few

fiddle tunes I have not heard. Once heard they are locked in

my mind forever. It is a sadness to me that I have sausage

fingers that cannot crowd onto a fretboard--little fat girls at

a cotillion. "Soldier's Joy"!

LeBoeuf

I don't believe he shlept.

Rooster

Fort Smith is a healthy distance, LeBoeuf, but I would

80

encourage the creature you ride to try to make it in a day. Out here a

one-armed man looks like easy prey.

LeBoeuf

And a one-eyed man--who can't shshoodt? Why don't you

tshurn back, Khoghburn?

Rooster

I will do fine.

. . . I know where the Parmalee's claim is. I am uninjured, I

am provisioned--and we agreed to separate.

LeBoeuf

In conscschiensh you cannot shite our agreement. You are

the pershon who shshot me.

Mattie

Mr. LeBoeuf has a point, Marshal. It is an unfair leg-up in

any competition to shoot your opposite number.

Rooster

God damn it! I don't accept it as a given that I did shoot

LeBoeuf. There was plenty of guns going off.

LeBoeuf

I heard a rifle and felt the ball. You mishshed your shshodt,

Khoghburn, admit it. You are more handicapped without the

eye than I without the arm.

Rooster

Missed my shot! I can hit a gnat's eye at ninety yards!

81

Rooster

The chinaman is running them cheap shells on me again.

LeBoeuf

I tdhought you were going to shay the shun was in your

eyezh. That izh to shay, your eye.

Rooster

Two at one time!

Rooster

I will chunk one high. Hold fire.

LeBoeuf

There.

Rooster

There?! My bullet!

LeBoeuf

Your bullet? If you hit what you aim at, eckshplain my

shoulder!

Mattie

Gentlemen, shooting cornbread out here on the prairie is

getting us no closer to the Ned Pepper gang.

82

Rooster

One more, this will prove it. Hold fire!

LeBoeuf

Azh I shed, Khoghburn.

Rooster

Did you not see the piece fly off?!

Rooster

Find our way back!

83

Rooster

Lucky Ned!

LeBoeuf

Very good, Khoghburn. Now what.

LeBoeuf

Cogburn does not want me eating out of his store.

Mattie

That is silly. You have not eaten the whole day, and it is my

store not his.

Rooster

Let him starve!

84

Rooster

He does not track! He does not shoot--except at foodstuffs!--

LeBoeuf

That wazh your idea.

Rooster

--He does not contribute! He is a millstone, with opinions!

He is a man who walks in front of bullets!

. . . He is a drag-brake for horses!

Mattie

Mr. LeBoeuf drew single-handed upon the Lucky Ned

Pepper Gang while we fired safely from cover, like a band of

sly Injuns!

Rooster

We?

Mattie

It is unfair to indict a man when his jaw is swollen and

tongue mangled and who is therefore unable to rise to his

own defense!

LeBoeuf

I can thpeak for mythelf. I am hardly obliged to anther the

ravingth of a drunkard. It ith beneath me.

. . . I shall make my own camp elthwhere. It ith you who

have nothing to offer, Khoghburn. A shad picture indeed.

Thish izh no longer a manhunt, it izh a debauch. The Texath

Ranger preththeth on alone.

Rooster

Take the girl! I bow out!

LeBoeuf

A fine thing to deshide once you have brought her into the

middle of the Choctaw Nation.

85

Rooster

I bow out! I wash my hands!

Mattie

Gentlemen, we cannot fall out in this fashion, so close to our

goal, with Tom Chaney nearly in hand!

Rooster

In hand?! If he is not in a shallow grave, somewhere

between here and Fort Smith, he is gone! Long gone!

Thanks to Mr. LeBoeuf, we missed our shot! We have

barked, and the birds have flown! Gone gone gone! Lucky

Ned and his cohort, gone! Your fifty dollars, gone! Gone

the whiskey seized in evidence! The trail is cold, if ever

there was one! I am a foolish old man who has been drawn

into a wild goose chase by a harpy in trousers--and a

nincompoop! Well, Mr. LeBoeuf can wander the Choctaw

Nation for as long as he likes; perhaps the local Indians will

take him in and honor his gibberings by making him Chief!

You, sister, may go where you like! I return home! Our

engagement is terminated! I bow out!

Mattie

I am going with you.

LeBoeuf

Oh, that izh not poshible.

Mattie

Have I held you back? I have a Colt's dragoon revolver

which I know how to use, and I would be no more of a

burden to you than I was to the marshal.

86

LeBoeuf

That izh not my worry. You have earned your shpurzh, that

izh clear enough--you have been a regular "old hand" on the

trail. But Cogburn izh right, even if I would not give him the

shatishfaction of consheding it. The trail izh cold, and I am

conshiderably diminished.

Mattie

How can you give up now, after the many months you've

dedicated to finding Chaney? You have shown great

determination. I misjudged you. I picked the wrong man.

LeBoeuf

I would go on in your company if there were clear way to go.

But we would be shtriking out blindly. Chelmshford izh

gone--we have chaished him right off the map. There izh

nothing for it. I am bound for Texash, and it izh time for you

to go home too.

. . . The marshal, when he shoberzh, izh your way back.

Mattie

I will not go back. Not without Chaney, dead or alive.

LeBoeuf

I misjudged you as well. I eckshtend my hand.

Mattie

Mr. LeBoeuf! Please!

LeBoeuf

Adiosh!

87

88

Chaney

Well now I know you. Your name is Mattie. You are little

Mattie the bookkeeper. Isn't this something.

Mattie

Yes, and I know you, Tom Chaney.

Chaney

What are you doing here?

Mattie

I came to fetch water.

Chaney

I mean what are you doing here in these mountains?

Mattie

I have not been formally deputized but I am acting as an

agent for Marshal Reuben Cogburn and Judge Parker's court.

89

. . . I have come to take you back to Fort Smith.

Chaney

Well I will not go. How do you like that?

Mattie

There is a posse of officers up on the hill who will force you

to go.

Chaney

That is interesting news. How many is up there?

Mattie

Right around fifty. They are all well armed and they mean

business. What I want you to do now is come on across the

creek and walk in front of me up the hill.

Chaney

I think I will oblige the officers to come after me.

Mattie

If you refuse to go I will have to shoot you.

Chaney

Oh? Then you had better cock your piece.

. . . All the way back til it locks.

Mattie

I know how to do it.

. . . You will not go with me?

Chaney

I think not. It is just the other way around. You are going

90

with me. I will--

Chaney

I did not think you would do it.

Mattie

What do you think now?

Chaney

One of my short ribs is broken. It hurts jiggers every breath

I take.

Mattie

You killed my father when he was trying to help you. I have

one of the gold pieces you took from him. Now give me the

other.

Chaney

I regret that shooting. Mr. Ross was decent to me but he

ought not to have meddled in my business.

Rooster

Mattie!

Mattie

I am down here! Chaney is taken into custody!

Chaney

I was drinking and I was mad through and through. Nothing

has gone right for me.

91

Mattie

No, you are just a piece of trash, that is all.

Chaney

Everything is against me. Now I am shot by a child.

Mattie

Stop!

Mattie

Help me! Down here! Hurry up!

Lucky Ned

(to Chaney)

Take them horses you got and move!

92

Lucky Ned

(to Chaney)

Get on up that hill! Don't you stop.

. . . Who all is down there?

Mattie

Marshal Cogburn and fifty more officers.

Lucky Ned

Tell me another lie and I will stove your head in!

Mattie

Just the marshal.

Lucky Ned

Cogburn! Do you hear me?

. . . You answer me, Rooster! I will kill this girl! You know

I will do it!

Rooster's Voice

The girl is nothing to me! She is a runaway from Arkansas!

Lucky Ned

That is very well! Do you advise me to kill her?

Rooster's Voice

Do what you think is best, Ned! She is nothing to me but a

lost child!

. . . Think it over first.

93

Lucky Ned

I have already thought it over! You get mounted double fast!

If I see you riding over that bald ridge to the northwest I will

spare the girl. You have five minutes!

Rooster

I will need more than five minutes!

Lucky Ned

I will not give you more time.

Rooster

There will be a party of marshals in here soon, Ned! Let me

have Chaney and the girl and I will mislead them for six

hours!

Lucky Ned

Too thin, Rooster! Too thin! Your five minutes is running!

No more talk!

Rooster's Voice

I am leaving but you must give me time!

Lucky Ned

Up that hill!

Lucky Ned

Quiet there!

94

Mattie

You will not shoot me.

Lucky Ned

I will do what I have to do.

Mattie

Can I have some of that bacon?

Lucky Ned

Help yourself. Have some of the coffee.

Mattie

I do not drink coffee. I am fourteen.

Lucky Ned

We do not have buttermilk. And we do not have bread. We

are poorly supplied. What are you doing here?

Chaney

I will wring your scrawny neck!

Lucky Ned

Let that go! Farrell, see to his wound. What happened?

What are you doing here?

95

Mattie

I will tell you what and you will see that I am in the right.

Tom Chaney there shot my father to death in Fort Smith and

robbed him of two gold pieces and stole his mare. Her name

is Judy but I did not see her down at the river. I was

informed Rooster Cogburn had grit and I hired him out to

find the murderer. A few minutes ago I came upon Chaney

watering the horses. He would not be taken in charge and I

shot him. If I had killed him I would not be now in this fix.

My revolver misfired.

Lucky Ned

They will do it. It will embarrass you every time. Most girls

like to play pretties, but you like guns do you?

Mattie

I do not care a thing in the world about guns. If I did I would

have one that worked.

Chaney

I was shot from ambush, Ned. The horses was blowing and

making noise. It was that officer that got me.

Mattie

How can you sit there and tell such a big story?

Chaney

That pit is a hundred feet deep and I will throw you into it

and leave you to scream and rot! How do you like that?

Mattie

No you won't. This man will not let you have your way. He

is your boss and you must do as he tells you.

Chaney

Five minutes is well up!

96

Lucky Ned

I will give him a little more time.

Chaney

How much more?

Lucky Ned

Til I think he has had enough.

Well Dressed Man

He is gone, Ned! I can see nothing! We had best make a

move!

Lucky Ned

Hold fast a while there, Doctor!

Mattie

Why doesn't the Doctor do that?

Lucky Ned

He is not a medical doctor. Was that Rooster waylaid us

night before last?

Mattie

It was Marshal Cogburn and myself.

Lucky Ned

Yourself, eh? You and Cogburn, quite the posse.

97

Lucky Ned

Your friend is gone. You are alone.

Well Dressed Man

We must move, Ned.

Lucky Ned

You are too nervous, Doctor. It will be hours before he is

back with help.

. . . What happened to Quincy, and The Kid?

Mattie

They are both dead. I was in the very middle of it. It was a

terrible thing to see. Do you need a good lawyer?

Lucky Ned

I need a good judge. What about Coke Hayes--the old

fellow shot off his horse?

Mattie

Dead as well. His depredations have come to an end.

Lucky Ned

Poor Coke. He rode back for me. Coke Hayes had spine,

and could keep his wits in a tight spot. Dead now, but he

should have been dead ten times afore now. Your friend

Rooster does not collect many prisoners.

98

Mattie

He is not my friend. He has abandoned me to a congress of

louts.

Lucky Ned

You do not varnish your opinions.

Well Dressed Man

Are we staying here for chat?

Soldier

Do an owl, Harold!

Idiot

Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

Chaney

Let us cut up the winnings from the Katie Flyer.

Lucky Ned

There will be time for that at The Old Place.

Chaney

I will saddle the grey.

Lucky Ned

I have other plans for you.

Chaney

Must I double-mount with the Doctor?

Well Dressed Man

No!

Lucky Ned

No, it will be too chancy with two men up if it comes to a

99

race. You will wait here with the girl. When we reach Ma's house I will

send Carroll back with a fresh mount. You will be out by

dark and we will wait for you at The Old Place.

Chaney

I don't like that. Let me ride with you, Ned, just out of here

anyway.

Lucky Ned

No. We are short a horse. It can't be helped.

Chaney

Marshals will come swarming.

Lucky Ned

Hours, if they come here at all. They will guess we are all

gone.

Mattie

I am not staying here by myself with Tom Chaney.

Lucky Ned

That is the way I will have it.

Mattie

He will kill me. You have heard him say it. He has killed

my father and now you will let him kill me.

Lucky Ned

He will do no such thing. Tom, you know the crossing at

Cypress Forks, near the log meetinghouse? When you are

mounted you will take the girl there and leave her. Do you

understand that, Tom? If any harm comes to this child you

do not get paid.

Chaney

Harold, let me ride up with you.

Idiot

Baaaaa! Baaaaa!

Chaney

Farrel, I will pay you fifty dollars out of my winnings! I am

100

not heavy!

Soldier

Ha ha! Do the calf again, Harold!

Chaney

Everything is against me.

Mattie

You have no reason to whine. If you act as the bandit chief

instructed, and no harm comes to me, you will get your

winnings at The Old Place.

Chaney

They will not wait for me at The Old Place. Lucky Ned has

left me, knowing I am sure to be caught when I leave on

foot.

Mattie

He is sending a mount.

Chaney

That was a story. Keep still now. I must think over my

position and how I may improve it.

Mattie

Where is the second California gold piece?

Mattie

What have you done with Papa's mare?

Chaney

Keep still, you little busybody.

101

Mattie

Are you thinking about The Old Place? If you will let me

go, I will swear to it in an affidavit and once you are brought

to justice it may go easier on you.

Chaney

I tell you I can do better than that. I do not intend to be

caught. I need no affidavit.

. . . All I need is your silence. And I will have it.

. . . Your father was a busybody like you. There are always

people who will tell you what's right.

. . . In honesty, I do not regret shooting him. He thought

Tom Chaney was small. Lucky Ned thinks the same. And

you would give me an affidavit.

. . . You are all against me. Everything is against me.

102

. . . But here at least I have matters in hand, and once I have

done for you--

LeBoeuf

Sho that ish Chelmthford. Shtrange to be sho closhe at lasht.

Mattie

How is it you are here?

LeBoeuf

I heard the shotsh and went down to the river. . .

. . . Cogburn outlined a plan. Hizh part, I fear, izh rash.

(reacts to hole) But that izh a pit there! Mind your footing.

Mattie

A plan?

LeBoeuf

He returnzh for Lucky Ned.

103

Mattie

One against four. It is ill advised.

LeBoeuf

He would not be dishuaded.

Lucky Ned

Well, Rooster, will you give us the road?

Idiot

Moo! Moo!

Rooster

Hello, Ned. How many men are with the girl?

Lucky Ned

Just Chaney. Our agreement is in force: she was in excellent

health when last I saw her.

Rooster

Farrel, I want you and your brother to stand clear. You as

well, Doctor. I have no interest in you today.

Lucky Ned

What is your intention, Rooster? Do you think one on four is

a dogfall?

Rooster

I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned. Or see you hanged in

104

Fort Smith at Judge Parker's convenience. Which will you

have?

Lucky Ned

I call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man!

Idiot

Koo koo roo! Blawk!

Rooster

Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!

Mattie

Shoot them, Mr. LeBoeuf!

LeBoeuf

Too far, moving too fasht.

105

Lucky Ned

Well Rooster, I am shot to pieces. It seems neither of us is to

see Judge Parker.

LeBoeuf

Oh lord.

106

Mattie

Some bully shot! Four hundred yards, at least!

LeBoeuf

I am afraid I have--

Mattie

Stand up, Tom Chaney!

107

Mattie

Mr. LeBoeuf! Are you alive!

. . . Mr. LeBoeuf!

108

109

Mattie

Mr. LeBoeuf!

Rooster's Voice

Are you there?

Mattie

I am here!

Rooster's Voice

Can you clamber out?

Mattie

I cannot!

. . . There are snakes!

Rooster

Awake?

Mattie

Yes!

110

Mattie

Ahh!

Rooster

What is that?

Mattie

I am bit!

Mattie

Does Mr. LeBoeuf survive?

Rooster

He does--even a blow to the head could silence him for only

a few short minutes. Where are you bit?

. . . He is in mild distress, having swallowed a good piece of

his pipestem. Can you move?

111

Mattie

My foot is pinned and leg broken.

Rooster

I have her! Up with us!

Rooster

I will send help for you as soon as I can. Don't wander off.

Mattie

We are not leaving him!

Rooster

I must get you to a doctor, sis, or you are not going to make

it. (to LeBoeuf) The girl is snakebit. We are off.

. . . I am in your debt for that shot, pard.

LeBoeuf

Never doubt the Texash Ranger.

. . . Ever shtalwart!

112

Rooster

Come on, you!

Mattie

We must stop. Little Blackie is played out.

Rooster

We have miles yet.

Mattie

No!

113

Mattie

He is getting away.

Rooster

Who is getting away?

Mattie

Chaney.

Rooster

Hold on, sis.

114

Rooster

Put your arms around my neck, I will carry.

Mattie

Where are we?

Rooster

I have grown old.

115

Voice-Over

A quarter of a century is a long time.

Voice-Over

I had written a letter of thanks to Marshal Cogburn, with an

invitation to visit, along with the fifty dollars I owed him.

In his reply he promised he would try to call next time he

came to Fort Smith with prisoners. Brief though his note

was, it was rife with misspellings.

. . . The marshal did not visit, nor did he communicate

further. I had not been conscious during his leavetaking: by

the time Bagby rode us to Fort Smith my hand had turned

black. I was not awake when I lost the arm. I later learned

that Mr. LeBoeuf recovered fully. When the marshals found

him he was searching the pines below the rock ledge for

Tom Chaney's body. He found it and took it back to San

Saba for the reward. It was well earned.

Little Frank had sent me the flier. He had chaffed me

through the years over the fact that I had not married, calling

the marshal my "secret sweetheart," and he sent a note with

the advertisement: "Skill and dash--it's not too late,

Mattie!" Little Frank and Victoria have always liked jokes

and they are all right in their place. I have never held it

against either one of them for leaving me at home to look

after Mama, and they know it, for I have told them.

Standing Man

Yes'm, I am Cole Younger. This is Mr. James. It grieves

me to tell you that you have missed Rooster. He passed

away, what, three days ago, when the show was in Jonesboro

Arkansas. Buried him there in the confederate cemetery.

Reuben had a complaint what he referred to as "night hoss"

117

and I believe the warm weather was too much for him. We

had some lively times. What was the nature of your

acquaintance?

Mattie

I knew the marshal long ago. We too had lively times.

Thank you, Mr. Younger.

. . . Keep your seat, trash.

. . . It's just like a cranky old maid to pull a stunt like that,

burying him in the family plot. They say I love nothing but

money and the Presbyterian Church and that is why I never

married. It is true that I love my church and my bank. I will

tell you a secret. Those same people talk mighty nice when

118

they come in for a crop loan or a mortgage extension. I care

nothing for what they say. I would have married a baboon if

I had wanted and fetched it its newspaper and slippers every

morning but I never had time to fool with it.

Anyway, a woman with brains and a frank tongue and one

sleeve pinned up and an invalid mother to care for is not

widely sought after. I never did see Mr. LeBoeuf again but

if he is yet alive I would be pleased to hear from him. I

judge he would be in his seventies now and nearer eighty

than seventy. I expect some of the starch has gone out of

that cowlick. Time just gets away from us.
