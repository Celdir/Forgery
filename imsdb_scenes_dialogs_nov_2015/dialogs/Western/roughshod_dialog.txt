GRAHAM

(annoyed)

What in thunderation --

(calling)

Wait a minute -- stop --

GRAHAM

All right --

(then surprised)

What are you girls doin' way out

here?

MARY

Until you came along we were going

to Sonora.

GRAHAM

What do you know about that. Did you

sell your place?

MARY

(dryly)

Not exactly. They decided gambling

and dancing were bad for people.

(pointing)

Can I make it?

GRAHAM

Depends on how good you drive.

HELEN

She's a little out of practice.

GRAHAM

(cheerfully)

Slide over.

HELEN

(getting up)

I'm slidin' all the way over.

MARCIA

(rising)

So am I. Come on Elaine.

ELAINE

(flat)

What's the difference if we fall in

the canyon.

MARCIA

Don't talk like that.

GRAHAM

Nothin' to it --

GRAHAM

-- once you know how. Trouble is,

never was a woman knew how to handle

a team. Shouldn't let 'em loose on

the roads. No disrespect meant, Miss

Wells.

GRAHAM

Get up.

GRAHAM

There you are. Now take it easy and

you'll be all right.

MARY

Thank you, Mr. Graham.

MARCIA

(aghast)

There's -- dead men -- in your wagon!

GRAHAM

That's right. You had me so busy I

forgot --

(worried)

Come to think of it you better turn

around and drive right back to Aspen.

GRAHAM

They were murdered. I found the bodies

on Alder Crick, northeast of here.

Like I said if I was you, I'd go

back, because the men who killed

them might be on this road.

ELAINE

(bitterly)

Back to what?

GRAHAM

Why, back to Aspen, where you came

from.

MARY

Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham.

They threw us out.

GRAHAM

(distressed)

They shouldn't have done that.

MARY

We tried to point that out. But there

were some pretty nosey citizens who

wouldn't listen to reason. They said

Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right

to play poker in your own home but

not in a saloon.

GRAHAM

(sadly)

I knew something would happen when

they started puttin' up fences and

passin' laws.

MARY

Goodbye and thanks.

GRAHAM

I don't like to see you go.

GRAHAM

But that's the way it is. The live

ones go out and the dead ones come

in.

DISSOLVE

DISSOLVE OUT

STEVE

How does she draw?

CLAY

A little hot.

SAM

You want to get out of here before

noon, maybe you should lend me a

hand.

CLAY

Rate you're goin', we'll be here

until winter.

SAM

(amiably grumbling)

Account of you, I miss out on the

only excitement Aspen's had for

months.

CLAY

You're too old to watch such goin's

on.

STEVE

And I'm too young.

CLAY

That's right.

STEVE

I don't see no sense to makin' people

leave town if they don't want to

leave.

SAM

I don't either -- when people are

that good-lookin'. Maybe that's why --

they were too good-lookin'.

(philosophically)

But there'll be others along to take

their place after a while when this

quiets down. And everything will be

fine until some busybody starts

stirring up trouble.

CLAY

(mildly)

Don't you ever run down?

SAM

(to Steve)

Some people just have to run other

people's lives. Now take Clay. You

want to amble up the street and see

the fun and what does he say?

CLAY

(good-natured)

You stick to your blacksmithin' and

let me take care of Steve.

CLAY

We'll both take a look. Anything's

better than listenin' to Sam.

(to Sam)

Don't forget to shoe the mule.

CLAY

Who are they?

MAN

Don't know. Graham brought 'em in.

GARDNER'S VOICE

Clay, come up here a minute.

CLAY

Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.

GARDNER

Graham's got something to tell you

might interest you.

GRAHAM

(motioning toward

wagon)

Cal Forster and his sons. Somebody

killed 'em.

GRAHAM

You know that cottonwood grove on

Alder Crick? They must have been

eatin' breakfast the way it looked,

sittin' by the fire eatin' breakfast

and when I got there nothin' but

them lyin' dead in their underdrawers.

No horses or guns or grub.

CLAY

(shocked)

Forster never did anyone any harm.

(puzzled)

But what's that got to do with me? I

came into town from the south.

GARDNER

This was smoulderin' on the fire.

CLAY

I still don't see.

GARDNER

I got it day before yesterday.

GARDNER

Now are you interested?

GARDNER

You should be. Maybe Lednov heard

about that Sonora ranch of yours.

CLAY

Maybe he did.

GARDNER

We're going to look for him. Want to

come along?

CLAY

I've got eleven horses to get over

the mountains before snow catches me

and covers the feed.

GARDNER

(dryly)

And that's more important than finding

Lednov?

CLAY

Like you said, maybe he knows where

my ranch is. If he does, he'll be

waiting on the porch.

GARDNER

(with irony)

I'll drop the sheriff in Sonora a

line to sort of look around for him.

CLAY

Thanks.

STEVE

Who's Lednov?

CLAY

A man I used to know.

HAYES

Forget somethin', Clay?

CLAY

Shells. How much for six boxes?

HAYES

Six times six bits. But wait until I

finish this.

STEVE

You might tell a fellow things,

'specially if the fellow's your

brother, seems to me.

CLAY

Like what?

STEVE

Like why you're buyin' a whole slew

of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.

CLAY

I don't want to run short.

STEVE

You never said this Lednov's name

before, that I can remember.

CLAY

No call to. That jail looked pretty

solid to me.

(pointing to rifle)

How's she feel?

STEVE

Nice.

HAYES

You know bettern' to do that, Steve.

Unless you're figurin' on buyin' it.

CLAY

One he's got, more his size.

STEVE

But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's

no good for real huntin'. You shoot

a man with a 22 and where are you?

CLAY

The thing to do is stick to rabbits.

STEVE

What was he in jail for?

CLAY

You sure worry that bone. He killed

a fellow.

STEVE

In a fight?

CLAY

The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.

STEVE

This is an awful nice gun.

(sighting it)

Certainly come in handy when there's

men around who shoot people that

aren't lookin'.

CLAY

(points to rifle)

I may as well buy it for him.

Otherwise he'll be crying all the

way over the hill.

STEVE

You must be plenty worried about

Lednov sneakin' up on us.

(hopefully)

Think he will?

CLAY

Yes.

STEVE

At the ranch maybe?

CLAY

Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner

than that.

STEVE

(annoyed)

Do you have to be so close-mouthed?

I'm your brother. And I'm ridin'

with you. Remember?

CLAY

(smiling)

All right. I'll tell you.

CLAY

Let's say this is the penitentiary.

CLAY

Here's Alder Crick.

CLAY

And here we are in Aspen.

CLAY

That's Sonora.

CLAY

motioning) Lednov gets out of jail

and comes along here to Alder Crick.

Then goes along here toward the Sonora

road.

CLAY

That's Lednov!

(tracing)

We come along here.

STEVE

(pointing)

And meet him there.

CLAY

Unless the sheriff gets too close

and he holes up.

CLAY

So let's go.

STEVE

(motioning)

Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.

CLAY

Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin'

for one man. Me.

STEVE

Why?

CLAY

He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?

STEVE

Lednov.

STEVE

I don't like him.

DISSOLVE

STEVE

Another one, Clay.

STEVE

They sure must have been travelin'.

This keeps up we can start a store.

CLAY

Things get tough next winter, you'll

have somethin' to wear.

STEVE

I'd look good doin' the ploughin' in

this.

CLAY

Anybody hurt?

MARY

No. We came down the hill a little

fast and...

(rueful)

...the wheel broke.

(hopefully)

Can you fix it for us?

CLAY

What's the matter with her?

MARY

(dryly)

Too much excitement. How about the

surrey. Can you fix it?

STEVE

Jimininy. You sure were lucky, just

bustin' a wheel.

HELEN

(rubbing thigh)

You think that'sall we busted -- You

should see...

CLAY

This must have been in the family a

long time.

MARY

(dryly)

It was a gift from the citizens of

Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.

MARY

And this is Helen Carter.

CLAY

I'm Clay Phillips.

(motioning)

My brother Steve.

STEVE

(shy)

Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

(brightly)

We found your trunk. Were you doin'

the driven'?

MARY

I was at first. Then I was hanging

on.

(to Clay)

Are you going far?

CLAY

Yes, ma'am.

MARY

As far as -- Sonora?

CLAY

Just about.

MARY

We're going to Sonora, too, so that

solves everything.

MARY

We can ride in your wagon.

MARY

We wouldn't think of asking you to

take us for nothing.

MARY

There's only four of us.

CLAY

I've got eleven horses.

STEVE

(proudly)

Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada.

Clay and me have a place on the

Toulomne River. We're going to raise

horses like these.

MARY

They won't be riding in the wagon.

CLAY

(dryly)

Did you ever try taking a bunch of

horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite

a job.

MARY

You can't leave us here.

CLAY

Course I can't. I'll give you a lift

to the first ranch.

MARY

What good is it going to do us to go

to some ranch?

CLAY

(amiably)

You can stay here if you like.

MARY

We have to get to Sonora. There are

jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay

you for your trouble.

CLAY

I'm not running a stage line, ma'am,

and I can't take a chance on losing

the horses.

CLAY

When you're old enough to smoke,

I'll tell you.

(kind)

Get the horses started on ahead,

will you, Steve?

HELEN

Afraid it will stop him growin'?

CLAY

(turning)

Let's get your stuff in the wagon.

Like I said, I'll take you to the

first ranch. I wish I could carry

you all the way, but I can't. It's a

tough trip and women would be in the

way.

MARY

(dryly)

Our kind of women?

CLAY

(ignores that)

You'll have to drive -- except down

hill.

HELEN

Maybe you're going about this all

wrong. Why not try telling him we'll

do the cookin' and mendin' and washin'

for him. That usually works.

(then shocked at the

thought)

Yeah, but suppose he took us up on

it. Where would we be?

MARY

Maybe in Sonora.

CLAY

What's the matter with her?

MARY

(dryly)

Too much excitement. Or maybe it's

just the heat. How about the surrey.

Can you fix it?

STEVE

Jiminy. You sure were lucky, just

bustin' a wheel.

HELEN

(rubbing thigh)

You think that's all we busted --

You should see...

MARY

(sees Elaine)

Now where's she goin'? --

ELAINE

(half-turns without

stopping)

I -- lost something.

CLAY

It wouldn't happen to be this...

MARY

Who's the old folks?

ELAINE

(frantic)

Give it to me!

CLAY

This must have been in the family a

long time.

MARY

(dryly)

It was a gift from the citizens of

Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.

MARY

And this is Helen Carter.

CLAY

I'm Clay Phillips.

(motioning)

My brother Steve.

STEVE

(shy)

Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

(brightly)

We found your trunk. Were you doin'

the drivin'?

MARY

Come on, Honeybunch. We're changing

trains.

MARY

A nice, kind wrangler is letting us

ride in his wagon...

MARY

...as far as the first ranch. From

then on --

ELAINE

What ranch?

MARY

What's the difference?

ELAINE

(fierce)

Ask him what ranch --

MARY

There's plenty of time for that.

(sharp)

Come on, now. You've got to lie down

out of this sun. Stop worrying. I'll

find out what ranch after a while.

CLAY

(kind)

Stretch out under the seat, Miss.

ELAINE

(desperate)

Which ranch?

CLAY

How's that?

MARY

She's worried about where you're

taking us.

MARY

(dryly)

So am I.

CLAY

It's a nice place owned by an old

couple named Wyatt.

CLAY'S VOICE

They'll take you in until you can

make other arrangements.

CLAY

So both of you stop worrying.

DISSOLVE

CLAY'S VOICE

Steve, see the horses don't drink

too much --

STEVE

Leave that unharnessing for me, Ma'am.

CLAY

There's a place down a ways, where

you and the girls can wash some of

that dust off.

MARY

Thanks. And isn't there something we

can do about supper -- or making the

beds?

CLAY

(half-smile)

Steve and me, we use a saddle for a

pillow and roll up in a tarp.

MARY

(curt)

But you eat, don't you?

CLAY

Mostly, we open a can of beans and

boil some coffee.

MARY

Where do you keep the can opener?

CLAY

In the grub box.

(softening)

Toward morning the dew gets kind of

heavy so maybe you better fix up a

bed under the wagon. Spread some

bunch grass under the tarp and the

ground won't be so hard.

MARY

Marcia -- all of you. Come on.

STEVE

(trying to be casual)

Where'd they go?

CLAY

Swimming.

STEVE

It's sort of nice having company

along. Not so lonesome.

CLAY

When you get the team watered, rustle

up some wood.

STEVE

(to mules)

You boys have had enough.

DISSOLVE

HELEN'S VOICE

And I'm the girl who used to complain

to my mother about helping with the

wash.

CLAY

Get your rifle.

CLAY

(calling)

Hold it.

CLAY

Drop your gun.

CLAYTON

(mildly)

Drop yours. I'm gunshy.

CLAY

Then don't come sneakin' around a

man's camp.

CLAYTON

A fellow sees a fire go out all of a

sudden, he don't take chances. My

name's Clayton and I'm looking for

someone.

CLAYTON

I found their surrey --

CLAY

So did I. They were in it.

CLAYTON

She's a friend -- took off this

morning sort of sudden while I wasn't

around.

CLAY

(very cordial)

I'm glad you came along.

(introducing)

My brother, Steve. I'm Phillips.

CLAY

I gave the girls a lift. Didn't know

what else to do with them. Get your

horse and come on.

CLAY

(genial)

Here's a man says he's looking for

you girls.

CLAYTON

Hello, Miss Wells.

MARCIA

Jim.

CLAYTON

I was roundin' up some stock. That's

why I didn't come sooner.

CLAYTON

What do you mean running off without

a word.

MARCIA'S VOICE

I didn't know who to tell, it all

happened so sudden, those people

comin' and throwin' us out on the

street.

JIM'S VOICE

Don't you think about it, darlin'.

Don't you think about anythin' but

us.

HELEN

(quietly)

Looks like we lose a good piano

player.

MARCIA

(happily)

Jim came after me, Mary.

MARY

(dryly)

I see he did.

HELEN

With a milk pail in one hand and a

marriage license in the other.

MARY

(sharp)

Why didn't you say you wanted to get

married back in Aspen. I told the

man in Sonora there were four of us.

If only three show up, he might call

the whole deal off. We've got to

stick together. Like we've always

done.

MARCIA

I've got a chance to get married.

MARY

(quickly)

That's what I'm gettin' at. It never

works. Don't forget we were thrown

out of Aspen.

MARCIA

Jim doesn't care, do you, Jim?

MARY

But Jim isn't the only one you're

marrying. He has folks and friends.

What are they going to say? And how're

they going to feel? I tell you, it

won't work.

CLAY

Of course it'll work. You can get

another girl to fill out the act.

MARY

(ignoring him)

And look at it this way. How about

Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough

spot.

JIM

I know what I'm doing. My folks got

nothin' to do with it --

MARY

You've talked this over with them?

JIM

They know about Marcia.

MARY

(quickly)

And they don't like the idea!

CLAY

Suppose they don't. This is his

problem. He's over twenty-one. He

wants to marry Marcia and Marcia

wants to marry him so let 'em alone.

MARY

If you were in his shoes would you

take one of us home?

CLAY

I'm not in his shoes, so leave me

out of it.

STEVE

(friendly)

I would!

CLAY

(hurriedly; smiles)

Steve maybe you better get some wood

for the fire.

MARY

Would you, Mr. Phillips?

CLAY

(to Steve)

Go on, there's a good boy.

MARY

(bitter)

Don't you want him to hear your

answer? Well, I know what it is. For

the other fellow it's all right --

but not you. All you want is to get

rid of one of us.

JIM

Wait a minute.

JIM

No need of you two arguin' about

this. We know what we want to do,

and nothin' either of you says makes

any difference. We want to go home --

tonight.

(to Clay)

Will you sell me one of your horses?

CLAY

I'm sorry. I can't do that. I went a

long way to get those horses.

JIM

All right, we'll ride double. Come

on, Marcia.

MARY

No need to do that, Marcia.

MARY

We've got two horses and they're

four of us. So half of one of 'em is

yours.

(smiling)

The other half's a wedding present.

MARY

Big-hearted fella. Can't see young

love thwarted -- especially if it

makes one less girl to worry about.

That's all you really want, isn't

it.

DISSOLVE

MARY

Is that your kind of reading, Steve?

STEVE

I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at

the pictures.

MARY

You can't read?

MARY

Your brother's always looked after

you, hasn't he?

STEVE

Since I can remember, Ma'am.

MARY

But he just never troubled to have

you get any schooling?

STEVE

It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been

moving around most all the time --

mebbe when we get the ranch and stay

in one place I can learn my letters

then --

MARY

Don't you even know your letters?

STEVE'S VOICE

No, Ma'am.

MARY

Would you like to learn them?

STEVE

I sure would.

MARY

Maybe I could start you out.

STEVE

That'd be swell.

(shyly)

You know, you're an awful lot

different than I thought you'd be.

STEVE

You're so nice.

MARY

Did someone say I wasn't nice?

STEVE

Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me.

Only I got the idea that -- well

Clay and me used to be walking through

town and there was your place and

through the window I could see you

dancing, but Clay always took me

over to the other side of the street.

CLAY

(interrupting)

Time to go to bed, Steve.

STEVE

Good night, Miss Wells.

MARY

Good night, Steve.

MARY

(soft)

There's a nice boy.

CLAY

Yeah.

MARY

(sharp)

That why you always took him on the

other side of the street?

MARY

(sharper)

Maybe I don't make the grade in some

ways, but I know enough to teach a

kid his letters.

CLAY

(quiet)

He doesn't know his letters, no --

but he knows the names of animals...

he knows what roots to eat when you're

clear out of food... He knows the

difference between a possum and a

coon just by lookin' at the tracks...

more than most trappers know... and

he can tell whether she'll rain or

shine tomorrow by smelling the air

tonight. There's a lot of things he

doesn't know, I hope he'll never

learn.

MARY

Like what?

CLAY

(turning away)

Like sticking his nose into other

people's business.

MARY

Where's Elaine?

HELEN

She was here a while ago.

MARY

(softly)

Elaine!

MARY'S VOICE

Elaine.

(then)

Clay -- Elaine's gone.

HELEN

She can't have gone far. I wasn't

asleep long.

CLAY

What would she run off for?

MARY

(excited)

Because she's sick.

CLAY

(sharp)

Stay here. One woman wanderin' off's

enough.

STEVE

Don't you worry, Miss Wells. We'll

find her.

CLAY

(to Mary)

Build the fire up and stick close to

it. Come on, Steve.

CLAY

(annoyed)

Look around. She can't have gone

far.

MARY

(calling)

Elaine -- Elaine -- Elaine.

MARY'S VOICE

Elaine -- Elaine.

DISSOLVE

STEVE

Ma'am -- you shouldn't have run off

like that. Why I was just about to

give up lookin'. Come on, now.

STEVE

You can't stay here. There's snakes

and it's cold and you'll just get

sicker.

ELAINE

I don't care.

STEVE

Suppose that Lednov was to have found

you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't

have had a chance.

ELAINE

(sharp)

I said I didn't care.

STEVE

What's botherin' you, anyway?

STEVE

Runnin' off and worryin' people.

Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is

already.

ELAINE

(hysterical)

Don't ask me because I won't tell

you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!

STEVE

Don't act so -- crazy.

ELAINE

(dully)

I'm sorry. Let's go.

STEVE

(relieved)

That's a good girl.

STEVE

That's it. Watch out where you're

steppin' --

STEVE

That oughta be --

(then sharp)

Down.

STEVE

Lednov --

GARDNER

Want to take her off our hands?

CLAY

Who shot who?

GARDNER

Nobody. The light was bad.

GARDNER

Steve's!

GARDNER

What's she doin' runnin' around the

country at night.

CLAY

I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?

GARDNER

All I can get out of her is she don't

care about livin'.

CLAY

Look of things, she doesn't.

GARDNER

Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --

(motioning to Steve)

And him. Shootin' going on, we'll

never find Lednov.

STEVE

There was only three of them at first.

I guess I lost my head.

CLAY

(dryly)

How'd you happen to miss?

STEVE

They were quite a ways off and the

wind was blowin'. I didn't have them

to aim.

CLAY

Good thing you didn't.

STEVE

Clay --

STEVE

A man can't help gettin' excited

once in a while.

CLAY

That's right, Steve.

STEVE

Can I have my gun back?

CLAY

Sure. You'll find it under the wagon

seat. Like I said before, a twenty-

two's more your size.

FADE OUT

STEVE

(stumbles embarrassedly)

Gee, I can't.

MARY

Why not? You went farther than that

last time.

STEVE

I'm too old for it, Miss Wells...

That's for little kids.

MARY

Don't be silly... Nobody's too old

to learn.

STEVE

(resolutely)

Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --

CLAY

(mildly)

Oh, Steve!

CLAY

Get back to the horses. They're

straggling.

MARY

He's learning his letters.

CLAY

Yeah. While the horses wander all

over the country.

CLAY

(sternly)

Do like I said.

MARY

(dryly)

Learnin' to read has nothing to do

with the right or the wrong side of

the street.

CLAY

(motioning)

Are the horses stragglin' or aren't

they?

MARY

(after a backward

glance)

They're stragglin'.

CLAY

His letters will keep.

CLAY

Steve -- I want you to learn to read.

I meant to teach you but I never

seemed to find time. I figured when

we got settled on the ranch we'd get

around to it.

CLAY

It's all right with me if she teaches

you, but I don't want you forgettin'

your job.

STEVE

(flat)

I won't again.

CLAY

This isn't like other trips we've

taken. For one thing, we've got a

wagonload of women. For another

there's a guy wanderin' around hopin'

to put a bullet in my back.

STEVE

Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't

expect a fellow who never saw Lednov

and never heard his name until a

while ago to do too much worryin'.

You've been sorta close mouthed about

him.

CLAY

I guess I have. You were pretty little

when they locked him up. I don't

suppose you even remember that time

I was gone two months.

STEVE

Sure I remember. You went to Mexico

lookin' for cattle.

CLAY

(nods; then, after a

moment)

You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used

to go fishing and hunting with him

when you were so high.

STEVE

(offended)

Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico

or something...

CLAY

That's what I told you then. Only he

didn't. Lednov killed him.

STEVE

Oh... that's the time you went away.

CLAY

(nods)

I caught up with Lednov in Nogales.

He didn't like the idea of comin'

back across the border but he came.

I turned him over to the sheriff and --

that's the story.

STEVE

(looking off)

Maybe you shoulda killed him.

CLAY

Maybe I should. But I was never much

on killin'. Anyway, he moved too

quick and I just got him through the

shoulder.

(glances off)

Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.

STEVE

Yeah, it does.

CLAY

But you never can tell. Why don't

you get that new rifle out of the

wagon?

CLAY

And while you're there you might as

well find out what comes after K.

DISSOLVE

DISSOLVE OUT

HELEN

(crying out)

Elaine -- stop it --

MARY

She should be in bed where it's dry.

CLAY

(dryly)

Yes, Ma'am, she should...

CLAY

But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt

ranch and that's maybe five hours

away.

MARY

Can we get a doctor at that ranch?

CLAY

(straightening)

No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a

roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt

knows something about taking care of

sick people.

DISSOLVE

ED WYATT

DISSOLVE

DISSOLVE

WYATT

(happily)

My name's Wyatt. Certainly glad you

boys dropped in.

LEDNOV

Those the only horses you got?

WYATT

Why, yes. They're all I need...

LEDNOV

Mine's gone lame. Take a look at

him.

LEDNOV

Go on, we haven't got all day.

WYATT

Whoa, boy. Let's have a look.

WYATT

He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be

ridin' him.

LEDNOV

Put on another one.

WYATT

That won't help the stone bruise.

You ain't been around horses much,

looks like.

LEDNOV

Will you quit gabbin' and do what

you're told.

WYATT

(frightened, bewildered)

All right, but it won't do much good.

MRS. WYATT

I was up to my elbows in flour when

you boys rode up, that's why I din't

come out sooner. I hope Ed asked you

to stay the night?

LEDNOV

All we want's supper.

MCCALL

We're in a hurry.

DISSOLVE

DISSOLVE

PETERS

Take care of that horse?

WYATT

(gruffly)

Yeah. The best I could.

WYATT

What are you doin' --

LEDNOV

Lookin' around.

LEDNOV

These all the shells you got?

WYATT

Put my guns down and get out of here --

MRS. WYATT

Ed -- no, Ed.

LEDNOV

Your old woman's got sense -- you

listen to her.

LEDNOV

I asked you -- these all the shells

you got?

MRS. WYATT

(quickly)

They's a box in the cupboard over

the sink.

LEDNOV

(to Ed)

Get on about your chores.

(to Mrs. Wyatt)

And hurry that grub up.

DISSOLVE OUT

CLAY

Only a little ways now -- maybe a

mile.

CLAY

How's she makin' out?

HELEN

(dryly)

If she feels worse than I do, she's

dyin'.

CLAY

(calling)

Steve --

STEVE'S VOICE

Yo --

MCCALL

I'll have some more of that coffee.

LEDNOV

We got to get movin'.

MCCALL

What for?

LEDNOV

Because there's a man I want to see.

MCCALL

He can wait. Let's stay here until

morning.

LEDNOV

(rising)

I said let's go.

MCCALL

(protesting)

One night more won't matter. Your

friend'll be there. Anyway I don't

think so much of the idea of prowling

around his ranch. He knows you're

out so he ain't going to sit still

for it.

LEDNOV

(fierce)

I said I had a guy to see and I'm

going to see him.

LEDNOV

He gave me something once so I

wouldn't forget.

PETERS

(rising)

He says go, we go.

WYATT

If they'd only left me a gun, I'd

fix 'em.

MRS. WYATT

Hush, Ed. Hush. They might come back.

DISSOLVE

CLAY

Mr. Wyatt.

WYATT'S VOICE

Who is it?

CLAY

Clay Phillips.

WYATT

(calling)

You can light the lamp.

(to Clay)

I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid

those killers might come back.

CLAY

Three men on matched roans?

WYATT

Yeah, how did you know?

CLAY

The whole state's lookin' for 'em.

(dryly)

And they're lookin' for me.

MRS. WYATT

You don't know how good it is to see

you.

CLAY

Maybe you won't feel that way after

I tell you what I stopped in for.

CLAY

I picked up some women on the road.

MRS. WYATT

Tell them to come on in.

CLAY

But I'm going to have to leave 'em

here. They're --- well they're not

the sort of people you're used to.

MRS. WYATT

(a reprimand)

It doesn't matter who they are.

CLAY

(lamely)

And one of 'em is sick.

MRS. WYATT

Why didn't you say so. Go right out

and get her. Ed. build the fire up.

MRS. WYATT

(calling)

Wrap a stove lid in dish towels and

bring it in here. This bed's like

ice.

WYATT

(cold)

Put it back.

MRS. WYATT

Someone might as well get some good

out of it. Wyatt crosses to the trunk.

MRS. WYATT

It isn't as if she was dead.

WYATT

(cold)

It stays there, understand!

MRS. WYATT

(calling)

Right in here, Mr. Phillips.

MRS. WYATT

The bed's all ready and warm --

MRS. WYATT

(softly to Wyatt)

Go out and make some coffee.

MRS. WYATT

Go on. You too, Mr Phillips.

MARY

Is she very sick?

WYATT

(cold, flat)

Get 'em out of here. I won't have

'em in this house.

MARY

(softly)

So that was why she tried to run

away.

CLAY

(sharp)

Didn't you know she had a father and

mother out here?

MARY

(hurt and angry)

I didn't know anything about her

except she wanted a job because some

man had left her stranded. I couldn't

leave her in the street. Let's go.

CLAY

Hold on.

MARY

We can't stay here!

CLAY

It's a long walk back to Aspen.

HELEN

I don't know about you. But I'm not

being thrown out on an empty stomach.

CLAY

I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I

didn't know who she was.

WYATT

(quiet)

All right, you didn't know.

CLAY

I can't take her with me.

WYATT

Nobody asked you to.

WYATT

Just get those two out of here.

CLAY

You're not bein' quite fair.

WYATT

What's there to be fair about?

CLAY

I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I

didn't know you had a daughter.

WYATT

(quiet)

All right, you didn't know.

CLAY

I can't take her with me.

WYATT

Nobody asked you to.

WYATT

Just get these two out of here.

CLAY

You're not bein' quite fair.

WYATT

What's there to be fair about?

STEVE

Hello, Mr. Wyatt.

STEVE

(cheerfully)

Where do I put your things?

MARY

Back in the wagon.

STEVE

Aren't we stayin'?

MARY

No. We're not stayin' --

MARY

Everything's all mixed up, so don't

ask questions.

MARY

(soft)

Go on, Steve.

HELEN

Sit down and eat, why don't you?

HELEN

It isn't like this was the first

place we were ever thrown out of.

MARY

That's not what's worryin' me. Why

didn't she tell us? Maybe we could

have done somethin' -- gone somewhere

else -- puttin' a poor sick kid

through this --

HELEN

Quit worryin' about Elaine.

HELEN

She's home, isn't she? So worry about

us. We want to get to Sonora.

CLAY

This will be your room until Mr.

Wyatt finds time to take you to the

nearest stage station.

DISSOLVE OUT

HELEN

(whispering)

That sounds like him.

HELEN

This time don't talk about cooking!

CLAY

Coffee?

MARY

No, thanks.

(indicating Elaine's

bedroom)

I hope we won't be a burden to them.

CLAY

I hope so, too.

CLAY

(quiet)

If you're figuring on asking me to

take you, it's no use.

MARY

A time like this people ought to be

alone. Having us around is going to

make it sort of hard on 'em.

CLAY

(on the defensive)

I'm sorry, but that's how it's got

to be.

MARY

I suppose it is.

CLAY

And it's not only because the trip's

a tough one --

MARY

(softly)

You don't have to explain. Did I

tell you how grateful I am for what

you've done?

CLAY

I couldn't leave you sitting by the

road.

MARY

You could have treated us like they

did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a

thing like that -- it isn't in you

to be mean or cruel.

MARY

(softly)

No man who brings up a kid like you've

brought up Steve could ever be cruel

to people.

MARY

I hope you get everything you want

out of life --

CLAY

(wary)

Thanks.

MARY

You've earned it -- the horse ranch

on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the

spotted gingham.

CLAY

The who?

MARY

You should know. She's in your dream.

MARY

Ever since you've looked after Steve

you've had the dream -- a ranch on

the river -- good grass, good water,

barn corral and house --- that part

you've shared with Steve. The girl

in gingham you plan sneakin' in when

he isn't looking.

(she pauses)

CLAY

(enigmatic)

Go on. Tell me more about her.

MARY

She wears this gingham dress -- cooks

popovers -- makes jam in season --

makes her own soap from pig fat and

wood ashes and has cheeks the color

of red apples.

CLAY

(dryly)

I'll make the soap myself.

MARY

But the rest is right.

CLAY

Will she be dark or fair?

MARY

Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful

as the girl on a feed store calendar.

MARY

(softly)

I hope you find her -- because, like

I said, you've earned your dream.

Goodnight.

HELEN

Did you make it interesting?

MARY

I tried my best, but these things

take time.

HELEN

And we're running out of that.

MARY

There's still tomorrow morning.

DISSOLVE

HELEN'S VOICE

Those trunks look like ours.

MARY

They are.

HELEN

How long do you think we'll have to

stay here?

MARY

Until Pa gets around to driving us

to Minden.

HELEN

We don't want to go there.

MARY

No we don't. But that's where we're

going. From Minden we take a stage

to Reno, then another one over to

Auburn and another one to Placerville.

Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.

HELEN

Clay could save us an awful lot of

time.

MARY

He certainly could. About a month.

HELEN

What are you waiting for? Do

something.

HELEN

(sharp)

You're not giving up?

MARY

How many ways can a man say no.

HELEN

(crosses to door)

Maybe I better start working on him.

MARY

You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's

sake, at least...

HELEN

(sweetly)

If you can't bring him around, nobody

can.

HELEN

Go on. Have another try at him.

MARY

What's the use.

HELEN

(cajoling)

Please. Maybe he'll take a good look

at you and stop thinking so much

about his horses.

HELEN

A man has only so many no's in him.

HELEN

Look at you, sitting up already.

HELEN

Let me do this while you get some

breakfast.

MRS. WYATT

But I like to do it.

HELEN

You're worn out.

HELEN

Now don't argue. You've got two able-

bodied girls to help you so take

advantage of it. And don't let me

catch you touching the dishes.

HELEN

Well -- it's going to be good for

all of us -- having a nice long rest

here. After all -- Sonora will still

be there next month. Maybe we can

rehearse a new number -- try it out

on your folks.

ELAINE

Helen -- why don't you and Mary go

on with Clay?

HELEN

He won't take us.

(then, hurt)

Don't you want us around?

ELAINE

Of course I do -- but it'd be better

for you -- and the house is kind of

small --

HELEN

If you're worried about Mary and me

talkin' too much, don't. No matter

how many questions your old man asks.

We know how to keep our mouths shut.

ELAINE

It isn't that --

HELEN

Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get

you well quick as we can so we can

all get out of here.

ELAINE

But I want to stay.

HELEN

Drink this and stop being silly. Why

would anyone want to live in this

place. You might as well be dead and

buried. Nothing to do but look at

mountains. In a week you'd be talking

to yourself.

(then, brightly)

Maybe that's what got you started in

the first place.

ELAINE

(distraught)

I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying

here where I belong.

HELEN

Not if I know Mary. When she rides

into Sonora, you'll be with her. And

mighty glad to be there after this.

I don't see how you stood it as long

as you did.

ELAINE

(sobbing)

Stop it -- stop it.

HELEN

(contrite)

Darling -- now I've got you all upset.

ELAINE

Go away -- please.

HELEN

That's right -- you go back to sleep.

Tomorrow when you feel better things

will look a whole lot different.

Don't you worry about anything --

Mary's going to talk things over

with your folks --

ELAINE

(fiercely)

She mustn't -- don't you let her --

HELEN

There, there. Don't you upset yourself --

ELAINE

(wildly)

If she says anything to them I'll

kill her.

ELAINE

(sobbing)

I don't want to leave you, ever.

MRS. WYATT

What did you do to her?

HELEN

Nothing. The poor child's worried

about Mary --

HELEN

I won't let her say anything --

CLAY

Well, I'm off --

CLAY

(puzzled)

What's the matter?

ELAINE

Don't let them stay here, Mr.

Phillips. They'll spoil everything.

ELAINE

(wildly)

Take them with you -- Mary's going

to talk to dad -- she's going to

keep talking and talking to me until

maybe I won't want to stay here --

MRS. WYATT

Please take them.

CLAY

I can't --

ELAINE

You've got to -- don't you understand --

they want me with them and they'll

fix it so I have to go --

CLAY

(sharp)

No they won't.

STEVE

What comes after Z?

MARY

That's the end of the line.

STEVE

(happily)

Then I know my alphabet.

MARY

From A to Z. All you have to do now

is figure out what they mean put

together in words.

STEVE

And that's tough, isn't it?

MARY

Without someone to teach you, it's

tough.

MARY

He knows his alphabet.

CLAY

That's fine.

STEVE

I'll bet I'd be reading in a week if --

MARY

Maybe Clay will take up where I left

off.

STEVE

I don't think it's fair --

STEVE

Leaving them here when we could just

as well take them. We got plenty of

room in the wagon. And -- and --

they cook and drive the mules. They

don't bother anybody.

CLAY

Finished, son?

STEVE

(weakly)

There's only two of them now.

CLAY

I'll round up the horses. Throw that

junk in the wagon.

MARY

(happily)

You were right -- a man has only so

many no's in him. But he had me

worried -- that last one sounded so

final.

DISSOLVE

FADE OUT

STEVE

It's a lot tougher than I figured.

Knowin' my letters is one thing. But

makin' sense out of words is harder'n

trackin' weasel after rain.

STEVE

-- and even if I do learn to read,

what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live

on a ranch!

MARY

There's plenty of use for reading --

you'll see.

STEVE

U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's

that?

MARY

Unicorn -- a kind of animal --

STEVE

What do they look like?

MARY

Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with

a horn in the center of its forehead.

STEVE

Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have

'em in Nevada?

MARY

No.

STEVE

How about California?

MARY

Would they be good to eat?

MARY

(not too sure)

Kind of tough, I guess... But you're

not liable to hunt them -- I don't

think there's any alive now, anyways --

and I'm not sure but I don't think

there ever were...

STEVE

Then if they wasn't alive, how can

they be an animal?...

STEVE

An' if you can't hunt 'em and even

if you could they'd be tough, what's

the use of knowin' how to spell them?

MARY

You don't read to fill your stomach...

Poetry, for instance. All the poems

in the world wouldn't fill you half

as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but

they make you feel good.

STEVE

(stubbornly)

I feel good anyways.

CLAY

Don't go arguing with your teacher.

STEVE

I'm not, but there's some of it I

don't see any sense to.

CLAY

There's a lot of things I don't see

any sense to. But make up your mind.

Learn to read or --

(motioning)

-- go back and watch the horses.

MARY

Well, Steve?

STEVE

(grinning)

Now I know what a unicorn is, what

do we do next?

LEDNOV

We'll camp on up ahead away. That

leg ain't good...

CLAY

We're staying here until dark.

(motioning)

Pull over to the woods.

(to Steve)

You put hobbles on the horses -- all

of 'em. Get goin'.

DISSOLVE OUT

MARY

Where you goin'? Over to the other

side of the street?

MARY

Are we leaving?

CLAY

It's too light yet.

CLAY

Better go on back and get some more

sleep. You'll need it later on.

MARY

(soberly)

You're not going out to look for

them?

CLAY

No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is

keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead.

So I'm riding up the line aways to

pick us out a new trail.

STEVE

Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping.

Don't worry about him.

MARY

(turning)

Oh, I wasn't worrying.

(flustered)

I saw him saddling up and thought he

was ready to leave.

STEVE

(softly)

You were worryin'.

STEVE

Sometimes not knowin' how to read

has its points. You can't read books

so you look at people and figure 'em

out.

MARY

And you've got me all figured out?

STEVE

Sure.

STEVE

I'll fix us somethin' to eat.

STEVE

Like when you were standin' there

looking after Clay. I knew right off

what you were thinking. Because I've

been watching you.

MARY

You were supposed to be reading words.

STEVE

I was doin' both. Here.

HELEN

Thanks, Steve.

MARY

Better not let Clay catch you waitin'

on us.

STEVE

Don't pay any attention to him. That's

his way and I've found he's sure

easy to get along with. I don't

recollect him havin' hit me more'n a

couple of times and I guess I had it

comin'.

MARY

But you're his brother.

STEVE

He'll treat his wife just as good.

Maybe better. Ever see him use a

bull snake on the mules like other

wranglers?

STEVE

Yes sir, Clay's nice to be around.

(the clincher)

He don't chew much and when he does

he spits outside.

HELEN

(dryly)

You make him sound wonderful... Go

on. Tell Mary more about him.

MARY

She was only teasin'.

STEVE

(offhand)

Oh, sure.

MARY

Let me do that.

STEVE

I like to do things for you. Didn't

you know?

MARY

(softly)

I know now.

DISSOLVE

DISSOLVE

DISSOLVE

MARY

Don't you trust me?

CLAY

Not on this trail, I don't. I've

been over it before. Anyway, you

ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't

you climb in back.

MARY

I like to see where I'm going.

CLAY

(dryly)

Did you ever care where you were

goin' or where you'd been?

MARY

Maybe not! But I want to get there

in one piece.

MARY

(softly)

Why did you change your mind about

bringing us along?

CLAY

Why do you think?

MARY

(soberly)

I don't know. I thought I did. Now

I'm not sure. I thought it had

something to do with me.

CLAY

Oh, it did. It had a great deal to

do with you.

MARY

Just how do you mean that?

CLAY

You know so much about me -- figure

it out.

MARY

So that's it --

(he glances over)

You think I was making fun of your

girl in gingham.

MARY'S VOICE

I wasn't. And I wasn't making fun of

you or your dream.

MARY'S VOICE

Of course, maybe I was trying to get

you to do something you didn't want

to do.

CLAY

You wouldn't do a thing like that,

would you?

MARY

(softly)

Yes. But -- that was the other night.

Now -- I don't think I would.

CLAY

That's the West Walker. Take it easy

now.

FOWLER'S VOICE

Hold it!

FOWLER

What are you doin' on this trail?

CLAY

Followin' it. Any reason I shouldn't?

FOWLER

My name's Fowler. I'm camped up a

ways.

CLAY

Clay Phillips of Aspen. Been havin'

trouble?

FOWLER

Nope. But I don't want any.

CLAY

Neither do we. That's why we took

this trail instead of the main road,

and drove all night.

FOWLER

You're welcome to use my camp.

DISSOLVE

MARY

We might as well start a fire.

HELEN

Go ahead.

(nodding off)

Get in training for the pioneer life.

I'm finding the nearest body of water

and climbing into it.

MARY

Got a light?

STEVE

(innocently)

Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?

CLAY

(upset)

Just the grub box and bed rolls.

STEVE

I -- I think it'll be swell.

CLAY

When you get older you'll understand

things better. Like women and men.

Just because a man kisses a woman,

doesn't always mean -- well, he can

kiss her and not want to -- have her

around all the time.

CLAY

We got a lot to do, you and I. Gettin'

that ranch started and everything.

We've been getting along fine, all

these years. For a while I want to

keep it the way it is.

CLAY

Take that in and help her get

breakfast, will you?

FOWLER'S VOICE

(sharp)

What are you doing down here?

FOWLER

(curt)

You got no business snoopin' around --

HELEN

(hard)

Me snoopin'? I came down here to

take a bath.

HELEN

That something I shouldn't see?

FOWLER

(flustered)

No. But it's mine and I didn't want

anyone foolin' with it.

HELEN

What is it?

FOWLER

Just a thing I was workin' on.

HELEN

The way you act, it must be something

pretty secret.

FOWLER

Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.

HELEN

You wouldn't have a smoke on you,

would you?

HELEN

Thanks.

FOWLER

That sure smells good.

HELEN

I like it.

FOWLER

Up here in the hills, a man gets a

hankering to smell powder.

HELEN

Then why stay in the hills.

HELEN

That why?

FOWLER

I guess you can keep a secret. That's

a gold rocker. I'm doin' a little

placer mining in a place nobody ever

thought to look for gold before.

FOWLER

Look at her -- see her shine. One

week's work.

DISSOLVE

MARY

(softly)

Roll me a cigarette, Clay.

MARY

Thanks.

MARY

Why didn't you wake me?

MARY

You should have. I don't like leaving

things unfinished.

CLAY

(quiet)

Maybe it's better that way.

MARY

(intense)

You don't mean that Clay.

MARY

(a whisper)

Tell me, darling.

CLAY

What?

MARY

What does a man usually tell a girl?

MARY

Tell me -- please --

MARY

All right you don't love me. So let

it go at that.

CLAY

What did you expect? Speeches I don't

mean?

MARY

I don't expect anything. A minute

ago I hadn't cuite waked up.

MARY

I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you

want to say. I'll listen.

CLAY

If it's pretty speeches you want,

you won't be hearing them. Even when

I mean 'em, they don't come easy.

MARY

Save 'em for the girl in gingham.

Just tell me I'm not good enough for

you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't

change.

CLAY

All right -- it's said!

MARY

Then let's get started. The sooner I

get to Sonora, the better I'll like

it.

HELEN

You're sure there's more where this

came from?

FOWLER

Plenty more.

(motioning)

And somewhere up there's the lode,

the rock rotten with it.

HELEN

Pretty, isn't it? And all you have

to do is shovel sand into a thing

and the river does the work.

MARY

(quiet)

Give it back to him. We're leavin'.

HELEN

Maybe you are. I'm not.

HELEN

I'm stayin' here with Jed.

FOWLER

(shyly)

I figure we'll get along just fine.

HELEN

Well cheer, why don't you? No more

responsibilities, Mary. Marcia --

Elaine -- me -- all taken care of.

Down there feeding horses and raising

kids, you won't have a thing to worry

about.

MARY

I'm not raising horses or kids for

anybody. I'm opening the slickest

gambling house in California with a

crystal chandelier, the biggest you

ever saw --

MARY

-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a

big bar. Cash registers with bells

and a couple of boys with armbands

just to keep 'em ringing. What do

you think of that?

HELEN

Sounds fine. Only that isn't how

it's going to be.

HELEN

I'm sure of this. But not of you.

(shakes head)

You won't open any joint. I've been

watching you change. You're mad now

and you think you can change back.

But you can't. You'll end up making

beds in a boarding house.

MARY

(furious)

That's it then.

FOWLER

(the master)

That's it. She's staying with me --

for keeps.

MARY

If there were more men like you,

there wouldn't be so many of us.

FOWLER

Thanks.

MARY

It's nice to meet a man who doesn't

want to own a woman from the day she

was born. I never had the luck. The

only kind I've run into were tramps

or dirty-minded hypocrites.

CLAY

(to Fowler)

She's aimin' at me, but her aim's

bad.

(to Mary)

Want to know why I changed my mind

about bringing you? Because I talked

to Elaine -- because I was afraid to

leave you with decent people, that's

why. And you'll open your joint all

right. You wouldn't fit anywhere

else.

CLAY

Let's round up the horses.

CLAY

(sharp)

Come on -- we don't want to keep the

people in Sonora waiting.

HELEN

Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like

always -- he thinks you told Elaine

the things I told her.

MARY

(furious)

I don't care what he thinks.

STEVE

Clay -- look!

CLAY

Mary --

CLAY

(anxiously)

Are you all right?

MARY

(sharp)

No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked

and I hit myself against that rock.

CLAY

(nettlod at her tone)

I suppose that's my fault.

MARY

(wailing)

All my clothes --

CLAY

That's right -- worry about your

clothes --

CLAY

What about my wagon. Of all the crazy

fool things to do. You lose a man's

wagon because you're stupid and then

yell about your clothes.

MARY

For the wagon.

MARY

Go on, take it. Then you can't spend

the rest of the trip expecting to

get paid.

CLAY

(furious)

There won't be any rest of the trip.

Over the hill is a stage road and

when we hit it you get dumped into

the first stage that comes along. So

keep your money. You'll need it for

the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was

fed up with you before we started.

CLAY

Don't just stand there. Go on back

and get the packs on the horses.

We've lost all the time we're going

to because of a woman.

CLAY

Come on. Didn't you hear me?

DISSOLVE

MCCALL

We got company. Female company.

LEDNOV

(looking at the garment)

Yeah, we sure have.

DISSOLVE

DISSOLVE

HELEN

You can put this out of the way,

Jed. It's empty.

FOWLER

(turning slowly)

What do you want?

LEDNOV

I saw your fire and dropped by to

say hello.

FOWLER

Well, say it.

LEDNOV

What's the matter -- restless?

FOWLER

Yes, people make me restless.

LEDNOV

Even women?

FOWLER

There aren't any women here.

LEDNOV

I suppose that's your wagon in the

river.

FOWLER

Some people who went by this way

lost it.

(nervously)

Two men and some women. They packed

their stuff on horses and went on.

LEDNOV

And you're all alone.

FOWLER

Yeah.

LEDNOV

Suppose I take a look.

FOWLER

Go ahead.

MCCALL

Looking for something?

LEDNOV

Hold it, Mac.

LEDNOV'S VOICE

Get up.

LEDNOV

Come on. Where'd the women go?

LEDNOV

When I ask questions, I like to hear

answers.

FOWLER

They went on like I told you.

LEDNOV'S VOICE

How long ago?

FOWLER

Five, six hours.

LEDNOV

Sit down.

(calling)

All right, Peters, come on over here.

LEDNOV

(to Fowler)

So you were all alone.

PETERS

(sharp)

You keep your hands off.

HELEN

(yelling)

Let him alone!

HELEN

Kick a guy, would you! You scum! You

won't do any kickin' when they come

back.

HELEN

You dirty murderers... killin' people

when they're sleepin'...

LEDNOV

How do you know who we are?

HELEN

Everybody knows --

LEDNOV

(excited)

Who brought you here?

LEDNOV

You said somebody was comin' back --

who's comin' back?

HELEN

(moaning)

Stop it --

HELEN

Clay Phillips.

LEDNOV

Where is he?

HELEN

Up the trail.

LEDNOV

How far up the trail?

HELEN

(moaning)

I don't know -- I don't know.

PETERS

(huskily)

You didn't have to do that.

LEDNOV

(deadly)

Why not? She might have got to Clay

Phillips before I did.

FADE OUT

STEVE

Are you all right?

MARY

For the last ten miles I've been

trying to figure out how to sleep

sitting up. I'm getting to the point

where I don't think there's any place

named Sonora.

STEVE

It's a long ways yet.

(arrogantly, to Clay)

I figure we ought to camp. She's

tired.

CLAY

So am I and so are the horses.

CLAY

(to Steve)

Take the packs off. And run the horses

into the corral.

CLAY

I said take the packs off.

CLAY

(gruffly)

I figure we'll make better time,

letting the horses rest for a spell.

CLAY

So grab yourself some sleep while

you have the chance.

MARY

If you want to go on, I can make it

all right.

CLAY

Like I said, I was thinkin' of the

horses.

STEVE

You stretch out. I'll fix something

to eat.

MARY

(sitting)

Thanks, Steve.

CLAY

(angrily)

If you want 'em to find us, why don't

you go up on the hill and wave your

shirt or fire your rifle.

STEVE

I didn't stop to think, Clay.

CLAY

(short)

You better start.

STEVE

Maybe you and me better split up

when we hit Sonora.

CLAY

(mildly)

All right, I hurt your feelings. But

you know better than to go lightin'

fires.

STEVE

That ain't why. I just figure it's

about time to start runnin' my own

life.

CLAY

Maybe you're not hungry, but I am.

CLAY

Come on. We got a couple hours to

eat and get some sleep.

STEVE

I'll eat when I'm good and ready.

CLAY

Kind of feeling your oats this

morning. I haven't laid a hand on

you for quite a while, but that

doesn't mean you're too old.

STEVE

What makes you think you're so

almighty? Telling people what to do

and how to act when you don't even

know how yourself.

STEVE

You ain't even man enough to own up

when you're wrong.

STEVE

Go on, hit me.

CLAY

Sit down and eat. Till I say the

word, you're doing what you're told.

STEVE

You oughta say you're sorry -- that's

what you oughta do.

CLAY

You keep your nose out of my life,

young fella.

STEVE

Maybe I haven't lived as long as you

have, but I know a sight more about

people and I wouldn't talk to a mule

like you talked to her and, if I

did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be

man enough to do that.

CLAY

I said keep your nose out of my life.

No kid is going to tell me how to

run it.

STEVE

You think you're so slmighty -- smart --

Who are you to sit up there and say

nobody's good enough for you, like

you said yesterday -- just because a

man kisses a woman --

STEVE'S VOICE

-- doesn't mean he wants to marry

her.

STEVE

Well, if you didn't mean it, why did

you kiss her?

CLAY

Shut up and eat.

MARY

(sharply)

Stop it -- both of you.

MARY

I won't have you fighting over me.

CLAY

(to Steve)

I'm sorry.

STEVE

You don't know what it is to be sorry.

MARY

(sharp)

Steve --

MARY

(to Clay)

Mind sortin' out my things -- I'm

leaving.

MARY

Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but

it's going somewhere, which is all

right with me.

CLAY

It's going to Sonora.

MARY

Fine -- maybe I'll see you there

sometime.

MARY

Because as you said, that's where I

belong.

CLAY

I said a lot of things -- some of

'em --

MARY

Some of 'em you didn't mean but most

of 'em you did. I don't blame you

because I understand your way of

thinking and why you think that way.

You want your women on pedestals.

But they have to be born on 'em --

they can fall off but they can't

climb back up.

CLAY

(sharply)

I can't help how I think. You're

trained a certain way when you're a

kid and you can't change.

CLAY

If you're gonna catch this stage,

come on.

MARY

I can't change either. Not unless

somebody wants me enough to give me

a hand.

CLAY

Hurry up.

MARY

(softly)

I'm fool enough to believe that one

of these days somebody will. Somebody

who wants me as I am will maybe walk

into the place where I'm working and

take me out of there.

CLAY

Maybe they will.

CLAY

Mind giving a lady a lift into town?

DRIVER

(to Mary)

Climb right in.

CLAY

Will you be seeing the sheriff?

DRIVER

Depot's right next to his office.

STEVE

(shyly)

Goodbye, ma'am.

MARY

(quietly)

Goodbye, Steve. Don't fight with him

any more.

MARY

It's not his fault, just you remember

that. It's mine. Don't ask me why

because you couldn't understand now.

Some day you will.

MARY

Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.

CLAY

Goodbye, Mary.

MARY

By the way, if you ever go past the

Wyatt ranch, have another talk with

Elaine.

STEVE

You know what she asked me?

CLAY

I don't care what she asked you.

STEVE

She told me not to fight with you

anymore. She said it wasn't your

fault, but -- I figure different...

STEVE

It is so your fault and... and I

guess maybe when we hit the ranch...

you andme better...

CLAY

(sharply)

You want to split up? --

CLAY

-- Why wait? Go on, saddle up now

and beat it.

STEVE

Half of them are mine.

CLAY

(hard)

You'll get your share. Go on. I don't

want you around.

CLAY

There you are.

CLAY

What did you come back for?

STEVE

Like I told you, half those horses

are mine. I'm makin' sure they get

to the ranch safe. So let's quit

arguing and do whatever you figure

on doin'.

CLAY

(softly)

Is that the only reason you came

back?

STEVE

(gruff)

Sure. What other reason would there

be?

CLAY

(smiling)

I just wondered. Let's go.

LEDNOV

(to Peters)

Go on down and have a look.

PETERS

(scoffing)

And get my head blown off! Not me.

MCCALL

Call it.

PETERS

Heads.

LEDNOV

And you! Get going.

CLAY

(quietly)

Stick here.

LEDNOV

(calling)

Come on out, Phillips.

LEDNOV

(his voice echoing)

Those horses down there -- they don't

amount to much to me. Look at the

one with the bell.

LEDNOV

(calling; echoing)

Next time I won't miss.

LEDNOV'S VOICE

(echoing)

Watch the one with the white face.

CLAY'S VOICE

I'm here Lednov.

CLAY

Come on out.

LEDNOV'S VOICE

Come and get me.

DISSOLVE

CLAY

(rolling cigarette)

How's that?

STEVE

Kind of sore.

CLAY

You'll live.

STEVE

(shyly)

Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold

my own in a fight, huh?

CLAY

Yeah -- but don't make a habit of

it.

STEVE

So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell

you how to run your life?

CLAY

(stares down at him,

then)

I guess so -- but don't make a habit

of it.

STEVE

Well, then, I know it takes three --

four weeks for you to come round to

admit when you're wrong... But by

that time she's liable to be in

China...

DISSOLVE OUT

DOCTOR

(sharply)

Hold her steady. I'm not hurting

him.

STEVE

Maybe you're not, but I'll sure be

glad when you stop pokin' me.

MARY

Is it very bad?

DOCTOR

(grumbling)

Course not. A scratch.

DOCTOR

What are you doin' here?

MARY

Holding the lamp.

DOCTOR

Then hold it a little lower.

CLAY

Thanks for taking over.

MARY

(softly)

Thanks for loading me on the stage.

I know now why you did it.

CLAY

Like I said, women get in the way

sometimes.

STEVE'S VOICE

He tried to get rid of me, too, Miss

Wells.

DOCTOR

Keep still, will you.

DOCTOR

Put him over there on the cot.

Goodnight... He'll be all right.

MARY

Goodnight.

STEVE

Goodnight, Miss Wells.

MARY

(looking back)

If you need me, I'll be --

CLAY

Where you going?

MARY

To the other side of the street.

CLAY

Mary.

CLAY

That job you were talkin' about, did

you get it yet?

MARY

Why?

CLAY

(haltingly)

Because... well, you said you wanted

a man to think enough of you to walk

in the place you were working and

take you out of there... tonight I

was sort of tied up with Steve...

but tomorrow I figured on doing just

that.

MARY

(softly)

I haven't got the job yet.

MARY

But if you want to wait until tomorrow --

CLAY

(softly)

Is there any place in town a man

could buy some gingham?

FADE OUT

THE END
