DISSOLVE

STICKMAN

Eight the hard way! Pay the line!

STICKMAN

Seven a winner.

HAVEN

No, thanks...

STELLMAN

Know him?

PRINCE

No. Why?

STELLMAN

He just seems kind of free with that

money.

HAVEN

(to barman)

Whiskey -- like you'd pour it for

yourself.

BLONDE

Don't you know it's no fun to drink

alone?

HAVEN

Not till after the first one.

STELLMAN

You a stranger here?

HAVEN

(to barman, after

gulping it in one

gulp)

What kind of whiskey was that?

BARMAN

On the bottle it says Rye -- but the

way you take it, I don't see what

difference it makes.

HAVEN

Another Rye.

STELLMAN

(easily)

You didn't answer my question.

HAVEN

I'm a stranger everywhere.

STELLMAN

Got a job?

HAVEN

Listen, soldier. I know that one,

too. Got a job, stranger? No? Why

don't you join the Army? Three meals

a day, a place to sleep, a nice warm

uniform --

STELLMAN

It has a little more than that.

HAVEN

(deliberately)

Yeah, it has one thing more, and

that's what I could never take --

(looking at Stellman's

stripes)

It's got Second-Lieutenants.

STELLMAN

If you want to make it a personal

matter --

HAVEN

(coldly)

I don't make it anything, soldier.

You tried to sell something and I

didn't buy it -- so why don't you

just beat it?

STELLMAN

If I weren't in uniform, I might

teach you some manners.

HAVEN

If you could teach me anything, you

wouldn't be in a uniform.

BARMAN

You couldn't be looking for trouble,

could you?

HAVEN

I could, but I'm not.

BARMAN

That's fine, because this is one of

the best places West of the Atlantic

Ocean to find it.

HAVEN

That was my first impression.

BARMAN

(as Haven looks at

him)

That Lieutenant's a nice young boy.

HAVEN

I don't doubt it, but his mouth is

too big -- like your ears.

BLONDE

How is it now?

HAVEN

What?

BLONDE

Drinking alone?

HAVEN

(flipping her a coin)

It's all right -- try it.

CHARLIE

It's not a good habit if it makes

you pick fights.

HAVEN

Only with Second Lieutenants.

CHARLIE

We like Second Lieutenants here.

CHARLIE

You see -- here everybody fights,

except the Army.

HAVEN

I wouldn't know --

CHARLIE

(still smiling)

So anyone who doesn't like the Army --

HAVEN

I know what you mean, but I'm afraid

I'll have to come back. I like the

way you sing.

CROUPIER

Okay, Charlie?

CHARLIE

That's his limit.

CROUPIER

There's a sucker getting hot with

the dice at Ed's table.

CHARLIE

Well -- cool him off.

STELLMAN

Captain Iles -- the Commanding Officer

of the Post.

STELLMAN

Mr. Haven -- sir.

ILES

I see you finally got here.

HAVEN

(pleasantly)

I seem to finally get everywhere.

ILES

(introducing)

Mrs. Caslon, -- Mr. Haven.

ILES

You've met Mr. Stellman.

STELLMAN

It came off beautifully. He picks a

very good fight. In fact, I think

I'm still a little sore at him.

ILES

(grunting)

Sit down, Mr. Haven.

HAVEN

Thank you, Captain.

ILES

So you're operating under sealed

orders.

ILES

(disgruntled)

All this mumbo jumbo is characteristic

of the Military Information

Department.

HAVEN

We use it as sparingly as possible.

ILES

I've been in this territory for a

number of years -- and I think it

might be a little rougher here than

a suburb of Washington, D.C.

HAVEN

Very possibly.

ILES

Then why is M.I.D. sending you out

here?

HAVEN

Because two soldiers have been

murdered.

ILES

And they think I can't handle that?

HAVEN

They merely know you haven't.

ILES

I have only ninety-four men on the

post, with Indian trouble up north.

The War Department has refused to

send reinforcements, or am I boring

you?

HAVEN

(looking bored)

I'm not the War Department.

ILES

(explaining)

The two soldiers were killed while

escorting one of the gold stages.

HAVEN

(quietly)

Is escorting gold a function of your

command?

ILES

Young man, the functions of my command

look very pretty on paper, but they're

not very practical in a territory

like this. Do you have any illusions

about that?

HAVEN

I have no illusions about anything.

HAVEN

What's happening to the gold?

ILES

I've permitted it to be stored in a

warehouse on the post. Now everybody

is waiting to see what I do next.

HAVEN

What do you do next?

ILES

(with sarcasm)

Aren't you here to tell me?

HAVEN

(lighting the pipe)

Captain, you're in a bad way.

(going over to discard

the match)

Wells Fargo won't convoy gold. You

tried and failed and two men are

dead. The gold is piling up on the

post and you can't move it. Your

post is under-manned. You want the

Quartermaster at Platte to replace

seventy uniforms sent to the freight

office at West Rim City --

ILES

The freight building burned down

with the uniforms! I'm not operating

a fire department -- and if I was,

West Rim City is sixty miles away!

HAVEN

That doesn't concern me either.

ILES

What does?

HAVEN

The killing of two soldiers.

ILES

They were my men, Haven, and I'm

trying every way I know to find out

who murdered them.

HAVEN

So will I.

ILES

You'll find it harder than you think.

I don't know how you operate, but

it's a dangerous job that can get

you killed.

HAVEN

Perhaps I can get some help from the

Sheriff.

ILES

You can forget him. He's a miserable

man that somebody is using to keep

the law a joke.

HAVEN

You make it sound very difficult.

Why don't you just wrap up your flag

and take it back East with you?

ILES

(smarting)

Tell me, how will I know what you're

doing?

HAVEN

I'll let you know from time to time.

ILES

(coldly)

That's very obliging of you.

HAVEN

But I don't want to visit the Army

post.

ILES

Then report to me through Mrs. Caslon

here. You can be a friend of her

husband's. He owned the Argus mine

and died last year. If that meets

your approval.

HAVEN

Only if it meets with hers.

MRS. CASLON

I'd be delighted to help.

(she smiles at Haven)

ILES

(grim at the smile)

Is that all?

HAVEN

I think so.

MRS. CASLON

He really isn't that abrupt -- he --

ILES

Goodnight, Mary.

MRS. CASLON

(warmly)

Goodnight, George.

MRS. CASLON

You see?

HAVEN

I see.

MRS. CASLON

I think he secretly likes you.

HAVEN

He's a man who can sure keep a secret.

MRS. CASLON

(smiles)

Would you like a little sherry?

HAVEN

Only if you have some too.

HAVEN

Thank you.

MRS. CASLON

To your good luck.

HAVEN

What mine did the two soldiers try

to convoy the gold from?

MRS. CASLON

My mine -- The Argus.

HAVEN

(smiling a little)

That brings me to a question I decided

not to ask.

MRS. CASLON

(smiling back at him)

Then I'll answer it first. Captain

Iles has asked me to marry him.

HAVEN

I can understand that.

MRS. CASLON

(quietly)

But you can't understand why Captain

Iles should be involved in the gold

business.

HAVEN

(smiling)

I do now.

MRS. CASLON

It isn't just mine. You must realize

there's a lot of gold from all over

the territory stored at the post

warehouse.

HAVEN

How much.

MRS. CASLON

Perhaps as much as half a million.

(worried now)

In fact, I have about fifty thousand

in my safe now.

HAVEN

Who is doing all this?

MRS. CASLON

I don't know... that's the worst

part of it... not knowing.

HAVEN

(puts down the glass,

pats her shoulder

with casual

reassurance)

I might find out.

MRS. CASLON

Don't get into trouble --

HAVEN

That's why I'm here.

MRS. CASLON

I know, but --

HAVEN

Don't worry about it. Trouble and I

are old enemies. We understand each

other.

(he grins at her)

Goodnight.

MRS. CASLON

(smiling again)

Good luck.

HAVEN

You didn't tell me your husband's

name.

MRS. CASLON

Ben.

HAVEN

(repeating it)

Ben.

DISSOLVE

ORVILLE

Evenin' stranger.

HAVEN

You must know everybody in town.

ORVILLE

Everybody but one. I don't know you.

HAVEN

What's your name? You seem to be a

pretty clever fellow.

ORVILLE

Orville Weekly, and I can't be a

total blank. I been here six years

and I ain't dead yet.

HAVEN

Have you got a vacant room?

ORVILLE

Day, week, month?

HAVEN

I don't always know. And the way you

talk a man couldn't be very sure.

ORVILLE

Then it's eight bucks, cash in

advance.

ORVILLE

From Arizona, huh?

HAVEN

No -- I always put down where I'm

going next -- so I won't forget.

ORVILLE

Room ten -- end of the hall. Make

your own bed. Furnish your own towels.

Your bag's over there.

HAVEN

(picking up the key)

Thanks a lot for the key. I'll be

back later.

DISSOLVE

HAVEN

How about eating alone? Is that a

bad habit too?

CHARLIE

Just when you have to pay for it.

HAVEN

It's only money.

(sitting down)

I've changed my mind since I left

here awhile ago. I don't want to

pick a fight -- or break the bank --

or --

CHARLIE

(evenly)

What changed your mind?

HAVEN

(grins)

That's what I came back to find out.

CHARLIE

Maybe it would be better if you found

another girl.

HAVEN

(smiling)

No, it wouldn't... I looked.

HAVEN

That man in ape's clothing -- could

he be Charlie?

CHARLIE

No.

HAVEN

His eyes follow you around like a

couple of flies.

CHARLIE

They follow me to see that strangers

don't annoy me.

HAVEN

Only strangers?

CHARLIE

No one else would be so foolish.

HAVEN

First, you're beautiful. Then I like

the way you sing -- and now you're a

woman of mystery.

(to a passing waiter)

Champagne?

HAVEN

I don't want to be a stranger, so

I'll have to be foolish.

CHARLIE

You like to take chances, don't you?

HAVEN

If I feel lucky.

CHARLIE

Then I'd advise you to try the dice

table.

HAVEN

I'd rather get lucky here.

CHARLIE

(shrugging)

Every man has a right to go to his

own funeral.

HAVEN

(as the waiter sets

down the champagne

and glasses)

I could be your cousin from

Waxahatchio. I could be cousin John,

a missionary on his way to China.

HAVEN

He seems to be a lot of man.

CHARLIE

The most in town.

HAVEN

It's a very small town.

(he sips and gazes

around)

You could get it all in this saloon.

CHARLIE

We usually do.

HAVEN

So Charlie probably runs the town.

PRINCE

(toying with his dice)

Why do you care?

HAVEN

I'm going to spend some time here. I

want to know who winds the clock.

CHARLIE

It's been a nice conversation. I

hate to have it end.

MICK

Who's this?

CHARLIE

(after a taut pause)

Mick -- this is -- cousin John.

HAVEN

(relieved)

From Waxahatchie.

MICK

What's keeping him?

PRINCE

I think he's wondering if he couldn't

do more good here.

MICK

You aren't very friendly, are you,

mister?

HAVEN

(quoting)

A friend to all is a friend to none.

PRINCE

You ought to learn not to pick 'em

so easy, like you do your cousins.

HAVEN

(indicating Charlie)

Ask her?

CHARLIE

(coolly)

I never saw him before in my life.

MICK

(icily)

You're too little to make that big a

mistake.

HAVEN

You want to correct me or just bleed

at the mouth?

MICK

(coldly)

Bring him outside.

BRISTOW

What happened?

CHARLIE

(casually)

A misunderstanding.

PRINCE

Did you find out what he wants?

CHARLIE

(starting out)

He wanted to be my cousin.

(they follow her)

Only I haven't any aunts or uncles.

(still casually)

But you never know -- and the least

I can do is bury him.

BRISTOW

Mick will kill him.

CHARLIE

That's ten to one.

BRISTOW

(grinning)

I don't like the other fellow's

chances, but I'm a sucker for odds.

CHARLIE

You should always bet on a champion.

Then you can only lose once.

BRISTOW

You give ten to one...?

(she nods)

I'll take it.

CHARLIE

You're down. A thousand to a hundred.

HAVEN

Don't miss so much. You'll got tired.

BRISTOW

He can fight a little.

CHARLIE

A little won't be enough.

MICK

Stand still and fight.

MICK

(getting up very slow)

You can't do this.

MICK

(in the dirt)

Nobody can do this... to me.

BOUNCER

Somebody just did.

BRISTOW

I can't believe it. Mick Marion losing

a fight and me winning a thousand!

CHARLIE

(to Prince)

Give it to him, Prince -- in chips.

ORVILLE

Have some coffee?

HAVEN

(leaning on the desk)

Thanks.

ORVILLE

(turning back to pick

up a pitcher and a

bottle)

They told me who was fightin'. I was

getting ready to rent your room.

Cream or sugar?

HAVEN

Cream.

ORVILLE

(looking with mild

curiosity and

admiration)

Myself, I'd rather fight a forest

fire.

HAVEN

(softly)

So would I...

CHARLIE

How do you feel?

HAVEN

Like a million dollars.

CHARLIE

You just cost me a thousand. You

lost your pipe in the fight. I brought

it to you.

HAVEN

Do you always get sweet with the men

who fight over you?

CHARLIE

Only the winners.

HAVEN

Tell me something --

CHARLIE

(quietly, smiling)

What?

HAVEN

(he lies back)

That fellow might have killed me --

(sleepily)

Where do you bury the losers?

CHARLIE

You talk too much.

HAVEN

(bitterly)

What do you want -- the next dance?

CHARLIE

I think you'd better sit this one

out.

FADE OUT

ORVILLE

Have some coffee?

HAVEN

Thanks.

HAVEN

The way you run this dump I knew you

must be good at something else.

ORVILLE

Some call me the town poet -- and

some the village idiot. Who am I to

question either? How you feel today?

HAVEN

Like I crawled here from Kansas City.

ORVILLE

Well, it figures to make you pretty

famous. Fact, people been askin' for

you already.

HAVEN

Who?

ORVILLE

That gold mine lady -- Mrs. Caslon.

HAVEN

That's nice.

ORVILLE

Couldn't do better. And Charlie.

HAVEN

Charlie?

ORVILLE

No. less.

HAVEN

You seem impressed.

ORVILLE

Why not? Charlie owns a piece of

everything, includin' the undertaker

and the sheriff.

HAVEN

The stage line too?

ORVILLE

Everything but the Wednesday Bible

Class. Even owns a piece of me.

(grins)

Takes your money while you're here,

and makes you pay to leave.

HAVEN

(putting down the cup)

When you get the next verse I'd like

to hear it.

ORVILLE

Can't find no word to rhyme with

Mick Marion.

HAVEN

(as he turns away)

Carrion.

DISSOLVE

ILES

Of all the stupid bonehead plays!

What did he fight about -- don't

tell me a woman?

STELLMAN

That's what they tell me.

ILES

Who started it?

STELLMAN

I don't know, but Haven finished it.

ILES

That probably strikes you as a very

admirable thing.

ILES

Well, I don't think so! I have men

who can use their fists. Why didn't

they send a man who could use his

brains!

ILES

Well -- open it up!

HAVEN

Hello, Mrs. Caslon.

HAVEN

Captain... Lieutenant...

ILES

(coldly)

Mr. Haven, we may not have very much

around here that pleases you, but we

do have a strict post regulation

against brawling in the town. Now

would you like to explain what

happened last night?

HAVEN

(smiling)

I came here to return Mrs. Caslon's

call.

ILES

(indicating a chair)

Sit down.

ILES

This book I have in my hand is the

Army Register, 1882.

ILES

I am now going to read from it.

(finds the place;

reads)

"Haven, John Martin, born Ohio 1852.

Appointed Second Lieutenant. Promoted

First Lieutenant 20th Infantry, March

1880; reduced in rank to 2nd

Lieutenant January 12, 1881."

ILES

Is that correct?

HAVEN

It's the Army Register.

ILES

Haven, you've lost your rank once.

It may very well happen again.

HAVEN

To almost anybody.

MRS. CASLON

Maybe if you'd let him explain... He

might have a good reason.

ILES

Even a bad reason would delight me.

HAVEN

What would you like to know?

ILES

Did you pick that fight?

HAVEN

Those things can become very vague.

ILES

(shrewdly)

And where do you expect all this to

get you?

HAVEN

(rising wearily)

That is a question I prefer not to

answer.

ILES

(snaps it)

I think you're trying to carry your

authority too far.

HAVEN

Perhaps, but there's one thing,

Captain Iles... We had an arrangement

that we wouldn't meet -- you and I --

except through Mrs. Caslon... I think

it's important to keep it that way...

(one more glance back)

And I like it better.

DISSOLVE

HAVEN

Doesn't he ever stop playing?

ERNIE

Sam? It don't bother him. He's deaf.

HAVEN

Where do I find the boss?

ERNIE

First door top of the stairs.

HAVEN

Mick been around?

ERNIE

He's undisposed.

PRINCE'S VOICE

Come in.

HAVEN

(to Prince)

You wanted to see me?

CHARLIE

I did.

HAVEN

They said Charlie --

CHARLIE

Yes.

HAVEN

You're Charlie?

CHARLIE

That's right.

(nods toward Prince)

This is Prince. Don't ever gamble

with him.

HAVEN

You mean with his equipment?

PRINCE

She means either.

(he crosses to door)

See you later, Charlie.

HAVEN

You surround yourself with very

affable characters.

CHARLIE

It makes me feel at home.

HAVEN

You're not that sinister. Last night

with the wet towels you were Florence

Nightingale in silk stockings.

(stretching his legs,

looking at her)

Have you got a match?

HAVEN

There's one in my pocket but I hate

to reach for it... thanks.

CHARLIE

Sit there.

HAVEN

(smiles)

Now you're Florence Nightingale again.

CHARLIE

Why did you pick that fight?

HAVEN

I thought you did.

CHARLIE

(smiling)

Really?

HAVEN

You could have insisted I was your

cousin.

CHARLIE

Perhaps that isn't the way I felt

about you.

HAVEN

(as his knuckle hurts)

Ouch!

HAVEN

Where did you get the name of Charlie?

CHARLIE

It was my father's. My name is

Charlene, but --

HAVEN

I like that better... Charlene...

(she doesn't answer)

This'll be the first time I ever

worked for a woman.

CHARLIE

(giving him a glance)

What makes you think you're going to

work for me?

HAVEN

You sent for me.

CHARLIE

(finishing the bandage)

How's that?

HAVEN

Beautiful.

CHARLIE

(walking towards the

window)

All right, I sent for you. I was

doing a nice quiet business. That

was because everybody was afraid of

Mick. Now every time a man has enough

drinks in him to feel rugged he'll

try to do what you did.

HAVEN

I wouldn't.

CHARLIE

But they will.

HAVEN

That's not the job I want. I don't

intend to start at the bottom. I've

been there. It's too crowded.

CHARLIE

(coolly)

Where do you want to start?

HAVEN

With the money.

CHARLIE

And what will you do for it?

HAVEN

Anything -- except hang. How did you

get -- all this?

CHARLIE

I learned one thing from my father.

As long as men think they can beat

the tables, all you have to do is

get a table. Sometimes they run out

of cash and I find myself with new

responsibilities.

HAVEN

Such as --

CHARLIE

A couple of stores for one thing.

HAVEN

I can't see myself behind a counter.

CHARLIE

A sawmill, and a logging camp. The

logging camp's a long way from town.

CHARLIE

I own the stage line from here to

West Rim City, but that's a dud.

HAVEN

Why?

CHARLIE

Outlaws. The money was in gold

shipments. Now the mines won't ship

it.

HAVEN

I'll take that job.

CHARLIE

You mean ride shot-gun?

HAVEN

I mean run the line.

CHARLIE

Don't force your luck. You won a

fight last night. You could lose one

tonight.

HAVEN

Today I'd hate to tangle with a

butterfly.

CHARLIE

What do you think you'll get out of

running the stage line?

HAVEN

A commission on all the gold I get

through.

CHARLIE

That should buy you a small beer.

HAVEN

Glad to get it.

CHARLIE

It's pretty dangerous. Even Wells

Fargo locked up their station and

quit trying.

HAVEN

(leveling)

Who steals the gold?

CHARLIE

Who doesn't? All they have to do is

put a mask on and they all look like

Black Bart.

HAVEN

(rising)

Give me a letter of authorization.

CHARLIE

(going to the desk)

I can't bet against you twice, can

I?

CHARLIE

(smiling at him)

You know I forgot to ask you one

thing.

HAVEN

I'm working for you now. You can ask

me anything.

CHARLIE

How do I know I can trust you?

HAVEN

You don't.

CHARLIE

Can I?

HAVEN

Only with money.

HAVEN

(quietly)

Okay, boss?

DISSOLVE

HAVEN

(looking him over)

Are you the manager?

MANAGER

I am.

HAVEN

My name's Haven.

MANAGER

I've heard about you. You're the

fellah who took Mick Marion apart.

(looking at him)

Almost knocked me off my feet. But

my feet ain't been any good since I

followed Stonewall Jackson.

(keenly)

What business you got with me?

HAVEN

(handing him the note)

I'm the new boss.

HAVEN

Wait a minute. You're not fired.

MANAGER

I got to be. There ain't enough work

around here for one man, let alone

two.

HAVEN

Two can loaf as easy as one.

JERRY

Mr. Leonard!

MANAGER

Talk to him. He just took the reins.

(indicating the two

lads)

This is Jim Goddard. He's a regular

stage driver. Jerry here runs freight

to the sawmill. Boys, your new boss.

HAVEN

Hello, boys.

JERRY

(with a grin of hero

worship)

I gotta start out of here for the

sawmill before daybreak. Is that all

right, Mr. Haven?

JERRY

I seen that fight last night. It was

sure a beauty.

HAVEN

Glad you enjoyed it.

JERRY

What I liked was the way you --

HAVEN

Let's not talk about it. Right now

it hurts my hands to listen.

JERRY

Yes, sir.

HAVEN

What happened to you?

GODDARD

My last run. I stopped a bullet.

HAVEN

Did you get a look at them?

GODDARD

I wish I had.

HAVEN

I think I'm going to need you and

not on one leg. So sit down and give

it a rest.

GODDARD

(slowly smiling)

Yes, sir.

HAVEN

I'm coming back later and sit behind

your desk. I'll need the keys.

MANAGER

(taking keys from his

pocket)

Only things here that work.

MANAGER

Son, I waste my time. I might as

well waste some advice. You're full

of blood and vinegar, but this whole

thing has got something wrong with

it. Goddard only got nicked in the

shin. You might not be so lucky...

HAVEN

I might depend on something besides

luck.

MANAGER

Like for instance?

HAVEN

Well the fact that they don't seem

to shoot too straight.

MANAGER

They don't need to when they shoot

so often.

MANAGER

Worry it over.

HAVEN

What's this?

COLORED BOY

Sumpin', ain't it?

HAVEN

Who's it for?

COLORED BOY

Miss Charlie, Mr. Haven.

HAVEN

Where do you drive her?

COLORED BOY

Same places. Around the hills, down

the river, every afternoon.

HAVEN

I think I'll give you this afternoon

off.

COLORED BOY

I shouldn't let you do this, suh...

(looking Haven over,

especially the

bandaged hands)

But ah am.

DISSOLVE

PRINCE

Does this Haven move me out? Is that

the plan?

CHARLIE

Prince, you know I wouldn't part

with you.

PRINCE

But I always come up empty.

CHARLIE

Not quite empty. I gave you what is

probably the one honest feeling you

ever had in your life.

PRINCE

I keep forgetting that. Pardon me.

CHARLIE

What's the matter, Prince?

PRINCE

I don't like John Haven or anything

about him.

CHARLIE

You've said that.

PRINCE

What do you know about him?

CHARLIE

You want me to have him looked up in

the Social Register?

PRINCE

A man walks in out of nowhere --

CHARLIE

(turning)

And went against your table. Did he

play like a gambler?

PRINCE

He knew something.

CHARLIE

Yes -- and he took Mick.

PRINCE

So he can fight.

(shrewdly)

You like that part, don't you?

CHARLIE

I'll tell you one thing, Prince, I

don't like this part.

HAVEN

Stand there a second.

HAVEN

Every time I see you, you look

different, but you always look

beautiful. Why is that?

CHARLIE

I always have somebody to lie to me.

HAVEN

Take my hand --

(offering it)

But don't squeeze it.

CHARLIE

Tell me what you're doing with my

buggy.

HAVEN

My work. I'm the new transportation

boss. You hired me.

HAVEN

I presume you're going shopping?

CHARLIE

I wouldn't wear anything sold this

side of Chicago. I'm going to call

on a gentleman.

HAVEN

At this hour?

CHARLIE

His name is Mark Bristow -- and any

hour, it would be strictly business.

HAVEN

The way you say it -- he may need a

lawyer.

CHARLIE

He's a lawyer himself, but it won't

help him.

HAVEN

No?

CHARLIE

(with a smile)

What good is a lawyer if he never

gets in a court?

HAVEN

Like a doctor in a graveyard. Where

is this unlucky man?

CHARLIE

Across the street.

Mark Bristow, Lawyer

HAVEN

Shall I take the horses back and rub

them down?

CHARLIE

Do you think they've gone far enough?

HAVEN

I haven't.

CHARLIE

Then maybe you better wait and come

with me.

HAVEN

I wonder if you'd do me a favor?

MRS. CASLON

Why, surely.

HAVEN

It's a big favor, and I wouldn't

blame you if you refused.

MRS. CASLON

What is it?

HAVEN

I want to haul some gold from your

mine.

MRS. CASLON

That IS a big favor.

HAVEN

I know it seems impossible to you,

but that's one reason why I'm here --

to find cut what makes it impossible.

MRS. CASLON

Isn't that very risky?

HAVEN

That's why I couldn't go to anyone

but you.

MRS. CASLON

(hesitating)

I'm just wondering if we shouldn't

speak to Captain Iles first.

HAVEN

You know what he'd say.

(she smiles grimly

and nods)

He'd advise against it -- but if it

works my way, it may clear everything

up -- for all of us -- and for Iles

too. The War Department doesn't like

all that gold around an Army Post.

HAVEN

(softly)

We're working too much in the dark.

This may be the only way to see

something. It's a risk -- but someone

has to take it...

MRS. CASLON

(firmly)

Who else will know of it?

HAVEN

Just us. That'll be all who know --

and that's the idea.

MRS. CASLON

(simply)

I'll arrange it.

HAVEN

(grinning)

Don't look so grim. It's only your

gold and my skin. And smile when you

walk away as though we'd been talking

about what a dry summer it's been.

BRISTOW

...You know I'll always cooperate --

as much as possible. But I haven't

the money.

CHARLIE

(rising and going to

the desk with a sheaf

of papers, which she

places on his desk)

These are I.O.U.s for gambling. They

add up to six thousand dollars. Do

you want to count them?

BRISTOW

No.

CHARLIE

(returning them to

her pocket)

Your credit's over, Mark.

BRISTOW

My luck can turn, can't it?

CHARLIE

Not on my tables.

BRISTOW

I've seen other people fall in this

trap -- but I didn't think it would

get me.

CHARLIE

Nobody does. I'll have Prince drop

in and go over your books. Maybe we

can work something out.

BRISTOW

But I told you --

CHARLIE

That's the way it is, Mark. I pay

off on the line and I expect to get

paid. Give it some thought.

WIPE

HAVEN

You know, you remind me a little --

back there -- of a character I once

read in a book.

CHARLIE

I had an idea you'd read a book.

What was the character?

HAVEN

Simon Legree.

CHARLIE

Mark is mixed up. He's either crooked

without being smart, or honest without

being lucky. And that's no good.

HAVEN

I don't think I'd want to owe you

money -- even if I was honest.

CHARLIE

Even?

HAVEN

When I was seven I robbed my own

piggy bank.

CHARLIE

It's hard to imagine you being seven.

HAVEN

I was very fat and ate a lot of candy.

CHARLIE

Is that why you robbed your bank?

HAVEN

No... I robbed it to run away from

home.

CHARLIE

Did you do it?

HAVEN

Yeah, but I had to go back.

CHARLIE

Why?

HAVEN

It got dark.

DISSOLVE

CHARLIE

This is my favorite place in the

world... I always come here to think

about it.

HAVEN

What?

CHARLIE

The rook here and the stream. The

stream is always running away and

the rock is always watching it go.

It's two ways to be -- and I always

wonder which is the best.

HAVEN

They probably envy each other.

CHARLIE

Do you suppose any woman could envy

me?

HAVEN

I know it.

CHARLIE

But not a good woman?

HAVEN

Nobody is any good. You mean

respectable.

CHARLIE

Maybe.

HAVEN

Respectable people are very useful --

but they bore me.

CHARLIE

With certain exceptions.

HAVEN

(curiously)

Like who?

CHARLIE

Like Mary Caslon...

HAVEN

I thought we might get to that.

CHARLIE

How did you happen to know her?

HAVEN

I knew her husband.

CHARLIE

That's curious, considering --

HAVEN

Considering what?

CHARLIE

Ben Caslon was a very upright citizen.

HAVEN

Meaning I'm not?

CHARLIE

(adds thoughtfully)

She's certainly not hard to look at --

and now she has the money and is --

(looking away)

-- also very respectable.

HAVEN

Then why would she be interested in

me?

CHARLIE

Because you're no good. And good

women like men who are bad for them.

HAVEN

Flattery will get you nowhere.

CHARLIE

Fooling with her will get you nowhere

too -- except in trouble.

HAVEN

With whom?

CHARLIE

The army. Why is it you're always

getting mixed up with the army?

HAVEN

(idly)

What are the odds I hit the leaf?

CHARLIE

(absently)

Four to one.

HAVEN

Pass --

(he flips the pebble,

misses)

What's the army got to do with Mrs.

Caslon?

CHARLIE

She's engaged to Captain Iles.

HAVEN

Iles?

CHARLIE

He's the army boss here.

HAVEN

(smiling)

If you're going to frighten me, the

least you can do is hold my hand.

HAVEN

This is where you ought to slip --

and I should catch you and kiss you.

CHARLIE

No chance.

FADE OUT

ORVILLE

Hey.

HAVEN

You finish that song?

ORVILLE

Never do.

HAVEN

Why not?

ORVILLE

It's my fatality. I never finish

nothin'.

HAVEN

Maybe it's just as well.

ORVILLE

Maybe so. I thought I'd tell you.

Goin' back to your room will be a

waste of time.

HAVEN

It will?

ORVILLE

I don't know what happened on that

buggy ride, but somebody came and

took all your truck.

HAVEN

And, naturally, you didn't do anything

about it?

ORVILLE

What could I do?

HAVEN

You could have called the sheriff.

ORVILLE

Set a thief to catch a thief, eh?

HAVEN

I paid my rent and I think I'm

entitled to know who stole my clothes.

ORVILLE

(calling after him)

A man couldn't ask for no prettier

thief.

HAVEN

Hey!

CHARLIE

(leaning out)

Hello... I've been wondering where

you were.

HAVEN

I lost my shirt.

CHARLIE

You didn't imagine that I'd let you

live in that hotel, did you? I want

you available -- in case of trouble.

HAVEN

Where did I move?

CHARLIE

In a very nice room upstairs.

HAVEN

(taking out his pipe)

When can you get my things back to

the hotel, Charlie?

CHARLIE

Why don't you take them yourself?

HAVEN

(calmly)

Because that's not how they got here.

CHARLIE

You're really hard -- aren't you?

HAVEN

No.

CHARLIE

You have to play everything alone?

HAVEN

This hotel is no good. The service

is bad. The clerk's a poet, and the

mattress is not quite as soft as a

marble slab. But I'm beginning to

like it... and if I open this window,

and hear you singing...

CHARLIE

Is that the way you want it?

HAVEN

That's the way.

CHARLIE

They'll be there.

DISSOLVE

HAVEN

What brings you here?

GODDARD

(smiling)

I had a dream.

HAVEN

Yeah?

GODDARD

That you'd be back here tonight.

HAVEN

Why?

GODDARD

Maybe because you took the keys.

HAVEN

Don't they go with the job?

GODDARD

You know how it is with dreams. I

got the crazy idea you were going to

try something --

HAVEN

How crazy?

GODDARD

Like running a shipment.

HAVEN

Then what happened?

GODDARD

I wanted to be some help with it.

HAVEN

All right -- you've been some help.

Now you can go back to sleep and

I'll finish the dream for you.

GODDARD

I'm riding with you, Haven.

HAVEN

You are?

GODDARD

(grimly)

I'm riding.

HAVEN

(slowly)

You got more than your leg hurt,

didn't you?

GODDARD

Maybe I just like to ride in the

moonlight if nothing happens.

HAVEN

And if it does?

GODDARD

Then I think I got a little better

right than you to be there.

HAVEN

(gazing at him)

I was just thinking -- a nice guy

like you probably has a nice girl

somewhere -- or a wife.

GODDARD

What are we gonna do -- have a little

chat about women?

HAVEN

Some other time -- Let's go -- out

the back gate.

WIPE

HAVEN

What makes you so anxious to take

this chance?

GODDARD

What makes you?

HAVEN

I'm on commission. With me it's a

matter of money.

GODDARD

And you think it's something else

with me?

HAVEN

I can't think of anything else --

except curiosity.

GODDARD

(gazing out drily)

Some moonlight after all...

DISSOLVE

BANDIT

All right -- stretch!

SECOND BANDIT

Pile out with the hands up.

FIRST BANDIT

(to Haven)

Get down.

FIRST BANDIT

Turn around and keep 'em high.

same.

SECOND BANDIT

You, Goddard, start walking.

DISSOLVE

JERRY

Hello there, Mr. Haven!

HAVEN

Hello, Jerry. What's the haul?

JERRY

This is that load of grub for the

sawmill.

HAVEN

Want to ride my horse back to town?

JERRY

What about the wagon here?

HAVEN

I'll finish the haul.

JERRY

You're the boss.

HAVEN

(throwing it away)

Any excitement in town?

JERRY

(grins)

Don't know, Mr. Haven. I left before

daybreak.

Take him easy. He's tired.

JERRY

I'll give him a good rubdown.

DISSOLVE

PETE

Hey, you!

PETE

You see a rider comin' up?

HAVEN

Nope.

PETE

You sure?

HAVEN

Haven't even seen a lizard. Where do

I put this stuff?

PETE

Where did you put it before?

HAVEN

I never did. I'm a new driver. I

think it's grub.

PETE

Take it to the cook shack.

HAVEN

(pulling up)

You the cook?

COOK

Nah. I just wear this hat to keep

the flies out of my hair.

HAVEN

It don't matter to me, brother. I

just haul this grub. I'd just as

soon haul it back.

COOK

Take it next door.

PETE

(to the horsemen)

Any luck?

BEN

No sign of Joe. But there's the tracks

of another horse, circling the mill

and coming back on the road just

north.

(he points)

PETE

That's bad.

PETE

Let's go and look at this guy again.

PETE

You --

PETE

You sure you didn't see no rider?

HAVEN

Look -- you want me to say I saw a

rider? I'll say it. I'll say I saw a

ghost. It don't make any difference

to me.

PETE

When did you get this job?

HAVEN

Yesterday.

PETE

What for?

HAVEN

It's the system. If I don't work I

don't eat. I never been able to find

any way to beat it.

PETE

Who hired you?

HAVEN

(blandly)

Mr. Haven.

PETE

The guy that had the fight?

HAVEN

Same fellow.

PETE

Friend of yours?

HAVEN

(innocently)

Who?

PETE

This Haven.

HAVEN

Any man who gives me a job is my

friend. Look, I'm working, I haul

this stuff out here. Nobody wants to

tell me where to dump it. Everybody

wants to know what I'm doin' and

what I haven't seen. I don't know. I

get thirty cents an hour. How smart

does that have to make me?

PETE

Don't get hot.

HAVEN

(grinning)

I ain't hot. I'm just mixed up.

PETE

Forget it. I got a load for you to

take back when you're done here.

HAVEN

Sure.

PETE

How soon?

HAVEN

Well, I haven't eaten anything but

dust since sun-up.

PETE

All right -- grab it quick.

Work on this stuff.

BEN

What do you think?

PETE

We risk him, that's all.

BEN

He don't look right to me.

PETE

He don't look any worse than the

rest of it looks right now.

Come on, get this junk out.

HAVEN

How about a handout?

COOK

Help yourself.

HAVEN

You cook pretty good.

COOK

I ought to. I used to cook for six

hundred men a day.

HAVEN

Where was that?

COOK

Leavenworth.

HAVEN

This used to be my mother's special

dish. She made it right out of the

world.

COOK

My old woman couldn't boil a potato.

HAVEN

Who's boss around here?

COOK

I am.

HAVEN

I mean the whole works.

COOK

You talked to the man when you came

Real tough-looking fellah.

They're all tough till they get to

Mick come out here?

COOK

Last night -- and he looked like

somebody got to him.

HAVEN

How's that?

COOK

Face all beat up --

(casually)

Like your knuckles.

I had bad luck with a crate of

cauliflower.

COOK

That's what he brought down here --

a cauliflower face.

You fight him?

HAVEN

Mick? Do I look like I would?

COOK

(looking at him)

Just the knuckles.

BEN

Hurry it up, driver!

HAVEN

Comin'.

HAVEN

Not many of the hands here, are there?

COOK

All up at the logging camp.

HAVEN

Much obliged. That was real fine

mulligan.

Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

Who said it was? I just want that

gold outa here the easiest and

Sure.

It goes to Prince. Know who Prince

Nope.

He runs things for Charlie. Know who

HAVEN

Sure.

PETE

One thing...

PETE

That's a gear box you're hauling

back and it's got to be repaired.

ILES

Well -- what have you found out?

STELLMAN

Goddard's body -- shot in the back.

ILES

And no sign of Haven?

STELLMAN

One horse was missing. They might

have taken him away on that. They

wouldn't kidnap him if they'd killed

him.

ILES

Why would they kill Goddard?

STELLMAN

He was a Wells Fargo Detective.

ILES

I see... he was a man they couldn't

handle, so they shot him. But Haven

wasn't killed.

STELLMAN

He may have followed them on the

missing horse.

ILES

And he may be fishing for trout in

the Verde River. Why do I always

learn everything last? Why must

everything be common gossip by the

time it reaches me?

STELLMAN

I don't know, sir.

ILES

Neither do I, but I'll find out. The

Army didn't banish me out here to

set up a listening post. Bring the

man in, dead or alive. If he's alive,

arrest him.

STELLMAN

But can you arrest him?

ILES

No, but I can take any living human

No, sir.

Why, everybody. They found Goddard's

boy -- didn't you know that? What

happened? Tell me about it.

If you're trying to imply that you

And what do you want from me?

I'm going to make a statement, which

you will write and notarize.

BRISTOW

Is that all?

HAVEN

Yes -- except that you put it away

where it can't be stolen or tampered

with.

BRISTOW

I have a safe --

HAVEN

I can see you have.

BRISTOW

Meaning you don't trust me.

HAVEN

I do -- but I don't think you trust

yourself.

BRISTOW

Where do you want it?

HAVEN

Mrs. Caslon has a safe -- a nice fat

BRISTOW

I think I can arrange it.

HAVEN

All right -- here's the statement.

HAVEN

I solemnly swear that on Thursday

last, about eleven p.m. the stagecoach

in which I was riding was held up by

five armed bandits. The gold I was

hauling was stolen and James Goddard,

the guard, was murdered in cold blood.

HAVEN

I trailed the bandits, caught up

with one and -- killed him.

HAVEN

Put it down.

I then followed the horses bearing

the gold to a sawmill --

MICK

You sure it was Haven you met?

JERRY

Don't I know my own boss?

MICK

(giving him a shove)

Go in and get a beer.

HAVEN

...After I left there, I opened the

crate. The gold was in it.

HAVEN

That's all.

BRISTOW

Not quite.

HAVEN

No.

BRISTOW

What did you do about the gold?

HAVEN

I came to the conclusion that I

finally had enough money to need a

lawyer.

BRISTOW

(needing a drink again)

Have you seen the sheriff?

HAVEN

I've heard about him, and I still

came to you.

BRISTOW

I see. Well, as a lawyer, my advice

would be --

HAVEN

I didn't come here for advice.

BRISTOW

I'm wondering what you get out of

this.

HAVEN

It makes me more valuable to somebody

alive than dead.

BRISTOW

Who?

HAVEN

I don't know... yet.

BRISTOW

(levelly)

Now I'm wondering what I get out of

it.

ORVILLE

They been here lookin' for you, the

ILES

It was?

Yours!

MRS. CASLON

Now don't excite yourself.

ILES

I am very calm, and I calmly ask you

how you could allow that scoundrel

to transport gold from your mine

when --

MRS. CASLON

The man you call a scoundrel may be

dead at this moment.

ILES

And he may be in town at this moment --

where, in fact, he is.

How you could do this without telling

me --

MRS. CASLON

I only did it for your sake.

ILES

MY sake?

MRS. CASLON

After all, Mr. Haven represents the

U.S. Government.

ILES

Who do you think I represent?

MRS. CASLON

I told you, George, I was only trying

Well, it may concern me.

I thought I might need a lawyer.

CHARLIE

I doubt it.

HAVEN

I can realize how seldom legal

technicalities annoy you -- but I

have one that might.

(taking out his pipe)

Besides, he knows all about it.

PRINCE

About what?

HAVEN

About a gear box I failed to deliver.

BRISTOW

I don't know anything! I merely --

PRINCE

Shut up!

HAVEN

(quietly)

Mark is right. He doesn't know

anything. He just knows what I

dictated to him in a deposition.

CHARLIE

And what was that?

HAVEN

It was just a story. About a man who

got murdered, a thief who got shot,

and a gear box that got lost. Probably

nobody would believe it --

(glancing up)

...unless I got killed for it.

CHARLIE

Go downstairs, Pete. Watch the

stairway.

CHARLIE

(to Haven)

Who else have you told?

HAVEN

No one. Mark I had to have. He's a

witness and a notary. He makes it

stick. He stands it up in court.

CHARLIE

(always watching his

face)

What keeps it from getting to a court?

HAVEN

A cut.

MICK

He's running a bluff!

HAVEN

I ran one on you.

CHARLIE

You brought your lawyer. Ask him if

this doesn't sound like blackmail.

HAVEN

He can't think very clearly in the

presence of a gun.

PRINCE

But it doesn't bother you?

HAVEN

(coldly)

No, it doesn't.

PRINCE

What you want is money.

CHARLIE

I don't see how going to the law

will get it for you.

HAVEN

If you did see how, I'd never get

there, would I?

CHARLIE

I'm afraid not.

HAVEN

So it boils down to this: we can

make a deal, and all be happy

together.

PRINCE

Not as long as you always have

something on us.

HAVEN

Unless you also have something on

me.

CHARLIE

And how would that be?

HAVEN

When I deliver the gold to you.

CHARLIE

You mean the gear box?

HAVEN

I can even forget I looked inside.

So I stole a gear box... I'm still a

thief.

PRINCE

(indicating Mark)

What does he get?

HAVEN

He gets even with you.

PRINCE

Have you lost your mind!

HAVEN

It was all right when he lost his

money.

CHARLIE

All right... I'll give him the

IOU's... when the gear box is

delivered.

PRINCE

(smiling)

You don't realize how important it

is when a piece of machinery breaks

down. It could close the entire

sawmill.

HAVEN

I guess I didn't realize it.

CHARLIE

I think that's all.

CHARLIE

(to Haven)

You can stay.

HAVEN

(to Prince)

I think she was talking to me.

PRINCE

You roll nice dice and you bet them

jamb up, but some day you'll slip.

And when you do, I'll be around to

catch you.

HAVEN

You know, I think he will.

CHARLIE

Then you should be more careful.

HAVEN

The poorhouses are filled with careful

men...

(knocking out his

pipe)

...And so are the graveyards.

HAVEN

You've got a nice perfume.

CHARLIE

Carnation.

(she ruffles his hair

with her hand)

I almost had to have you killed. I'd

have hated it.

HAVEN

So would I.

CHARLIE

I'd have missed you... too much.

HAVEN

And too long.

CHARLIE

(she smiles at him)

Did you ever tell a woman you loved

her?

HAVEN

All of them.

CHARLIE

How did you get away?

HAVEN

I was always in the doorway when I

said it.

CHARLIE

You never said it to me.

HAVEN

Let's go over to the doorway.

CHARLIE

I seem to always end up like this

with you. I take you for granted.

You like it that way. It goes with

loaded dice and crimped cards and

fixed wheels.

HAVEN

Isn't that your business.

CHARLIE

It isn't my life.

CHARLIE

You told me once you might be a

missionary on your way to China. And

that's as much as I've ever found

out about you. You're working for

me, but for all I know you could be

working for somebody else.

HAVEN

Like Goddard?

CHARLIE

Why not?

HAVEN

I think I better bring you that gold.

STELLMAN

Haven.

HAVEN

Don't tell me you're still recruiting?

STELLMAN

Yes, we still want you. But this is

a little different.

HAVEN

And how's that?

STELLMAN

Captain Iles has asked me to take

you into custody, Haven.

CHARLIE

(quietly)

You heard the man.

STELLMAN

Best thing for you is to come along,

Haven.

HAVEN

That's what I like -- the best thing

for me.

PRINCE

Very friendly with everybody -- isn't

he? Wells Fargo detectives, and now

the Army. How far can he go?

CHARLIE

Exactly where he's headed now -- to

jail.

DISSOLVE

SERGEANT

(to Iles)

The Quartermaster at Platte wants

three sworn statements before he'll

replace those seventy uniforms, sir.

ILES

Three sworn statements! I told him

all I know. They were in the freight

office at West Rim City. The building

burned down.. .you sure he doesn't

want me to send him the ashes too?

(seeing Stellman)

All right, have Stamm fix the papers.

ILES

(pleasantly)

Come in.

ILES

Nice to see you alive.

HAVEN

Dumb luck.

ILES

You seem to have been living quite

an adventurous life.

HAVEN

Is that why I'm under arrest?

ILES

That's indefinite. I wanted to talk

to you.

HAVEN

If you consult the Army Blue Book it

might enable you to be more definite.

ILES

(grimly)

Curiously enough, you got me into

the habit of reading myself. You're

quite right about The Blue Book --

(fiercely)

UNLESS that officer should get himself

about one-half as far out of line as

you have!

HAVEN

How far is that?

ILES

Right here in your own statement!

HAVEN

I see you did what I expected.

ILES

You've gotten a man killed and Mrs.

Caslon's gold stolen. Is that far

enough?

HAVEN

Not quite.

ILES

(rising slowly)

Haven -- as far as I'm concerned,

this deposition is good enough for

me.

(indicates the

deposition)

I want these people arrested. This

is all the evidence we need.

HAVEN

I need more.

ILES

For what reason?

HAVEN

For the reason I came here... to get

the murderers of two soldiers -- not

to save somebody's gold. That's a

mistake you made. I still don't know

who killed them, but I'm going to

find out. And when the net is hauled

in, they're all going to be in it.

(rising)

That's my fish -- and you can have

the minnows.

ILES

(demandingly)

When are you returning Mrs. Caslon's

gold?

HAVEN

(firmly)

That's a matter between myself and

Mrs. Caslon.

ILES

I don't particularly like you -- but

I see no reason why you should get

yourself deliberately killed.

HAVEN

(smiling again)

It won't be deliberate.

ILES

What difference does it make how you

get killed? Where does it leave me?

HAVEN

Where does it leave me?

ILES

(meaning it)

Understand this, Haven. You're heading

for bad trouble -- and when it comes

don't expect any help from me. Is

that clear?

HAVEN

(smiling thinly)

From the beginning.

STELLMAN

Anything else, Sir?

ILES

(glumly)

Yes, three cigars, a pint of whiskey,

and a copy of that confounded Blue

Book.

DISSOLVE

HAVEN

What's the good word?

ORVILLE

For you it's not good. You're in bad

trouble.

HAVEN

I don't know how you can know so

much and move so little.

(turning to go)

I think I'll try it myself.

ORVILLE

Want to leave a call?

HAVEN

That's very nice of you.

ORVILLE

What time?

HAVEN

When you're sure everybody in town

is in bed -- call me. And if anybody

asks for me -- I went to jail.

FADE OUT

MRS. CASLON

Drop it.

MRS. CASLON

Turn around with your hands up.

MRS. CASLON

All right -- put it in the wagon.

HAVEN

Is this a hold-up?

MRS. CASLON

You want to put it in the wagon?

HAVEN

(looking at her hard

eyes)

Yes.

MRS. CASLON

Now was there something you wanted

to say?

HAVEN

I trailed one of the bandits here

where they cached it. I couldn't

haul it on horseback, so I came here

with the wagon.

MRS. CASLON

I know that's a lie.

HAVEN

Some of it's true.

MRS. CASLON

But not nearly enough.

HAVEN

I'll try it again. I cached it here

myself. I was going to turn it over

to them. I wanted to buy a membership

in their club. This was the initiation

fee.

MRS. CASLON

Fifty thousand dollars?

HAVEN

Well, you see, I thought it was worth

it.

MRS. CASLON

Well, you see, I don't.

HAVEN

(quietly)

What you're doing may get me into

serious trouble.

MRS. CASLON

If you're still in town in twenty-

four hours, I promise what I do may

get you hanged.

DISSOLVE

CHARLIE

I thought you were in jail.

HAVEN

I talked my way out.

CHARLIE

You're a very glib man. You seem to

talk your way out of everything.

HAVEN

Up to a certain point.

CHARLIE

What's that?

HAVEN

A gun.

(to the waiter)

Champagne.

PRINCE

Are we celebrating something?

HAVEN

(to Charlie)

You know, the first time I talked to

you we had champagne.

(smiling at her)

I think I should have been a

missionary and gone to China after

all.

CHARLIE

Didn't you bring me something?

HAVEN

No.

CHARLIE

But you will?

HAVEN

No.

PRINCE

(quietly)

No -- just like that?

HAVEN

It's easy to explain. It's just a

little hard to believe.

CHARLIE

Make it as credible as you can.

HAVEN

(smiling grimly)

I can't.

(filling the pipe)

I went to get it, and it was there.

But so was somebody else.

CHARLIE

Who?

HAVEN

Mrs. Caslon.

CHARLIE

Alone?

HAVEN

No... she had a gun with her.

PRINCE

Did you have one too?

HAVEN

The one she had was in her hand.

HAVEN

This could be that slip you mentioned.

CHARLIE

(to Haven)

So this nice lady held you up and

took the gold, is that it?

HAVEN

It's like saying I got robbed at

Sunday school. It's no good, is it?

PRINCE

(looking at him)

No, it isn't.

HAVEN

I even had to walk back to town. I

think that may be one of the longest

walks I ever took.

PRINCE

And one of the last.

PRINCE

Mick might have killed you, but you

fought him with your fists. The

sheriff had a gun but you took it

away from him. Ben had a gun last

night but it didn't seem to scare

you. Now this genteol petticoat waves

a pistol and you run for your life.

HAVEN

(twirling the

wineglass, glancing

at Charlie)

He makes it sound very silly.

PRINCE

Or I make it sound like what it is:

a lie!

(he rises)

PRINCE

No.

HAVEN

(smiling faintly)

My word doesn't seem very good around

here.

PRINCE

You've only got one thing left that's

any good here - and that's some gold.

HAVEN

(to Charlie)

Is that all I've got?

CHARLIE

Not quite. You've got some time.

You've got two hours to get it here.

HAVEN

You want me to fatten you up before

you kill me? Is that what you mean?

CHARLIE

I said what I meant -- two hours.

HAVEN

I once knew a guy who stole a dime

tip from a lunch counter and parlayed

it into fifty thousand. I might try

that -- but not in two hours.

HAVEN

(to Charlie)

You're sweet.

WIPE

BRISTOW

I've been looking for you. Where

have you been?

HAVEN

I took a walk in the country.

BRISTOW

Did you get it for her?

HAVEN

No.

(pausing in front of

the hotel)

Sorry.

BRISTOW

But that was the deal. You agreed to --

BRISTOW

If you're trying to pull something --

HAVEN

(finished with the

pipe)

You want to listen?

BRISTOW

(calming himself)

All right.

HAVEN

(explicitly)

I can't deliver it because I no longer

have it. It was taken away from me

by Mrs. Caslon. I've told Charlie,

and she's very unhappy. I have two

hours to produce the loot. You haven't

any idea where a man could raise

fifty thousand quickly, have you?

HAVEN

I thought not.

BRISTOW

What are you going to do...?

HAVEN

Nothing, Mark. The boat just sailed.

BRISTOW

What about me?

HAVEN

You'll have to think of something

very good.

BRISTOW

I can think of something.

HAVEN

(patting his shoulder

with a slight smile)

Go ahead, Mark. Go ahead and do it.

WIPE

CHARLIE

Everything ready?

PETE

All set.

PRINCE

Got enough men at the sawmill?

PETE

Plenty.

PRINCE

All right. Go back out there and get

them into the uniforms. We'll hit

the post just before midnight.

PRINCE

I don't know what we're waiting for.

CHARLIE

I gave him some time. He's in the

hotel. He's not doing anything. I

gave him some time. I don't care

what he does with it.

MICK

And I don't care when, but I'll get

him.

CHARLIE

Again?

CHARLIE

Bristow's here.

PRINCE

This should be good.

CHARLIE

(to Mick)

Let him in.

CHARLIE

You want the I.O.U's?

BRISTOW

You mean --

BRISTOW

Why? Did Haven --

PRINCE

No, he didn't.

BRISTOW

Then I don't understand --

PRINCE

We don't think they're going to be

any good.

BRISTOW

I didn't have anything to do with

it. All I did was write it. I'm not

in on this. I can still make them

good.

(he puts a couple

back on the desk)

Or I can --

CHARLIE

What?

BRISTOW

I can do business.

(fumbling in his pocket)

I got it somewhere. I -- Here --

take a look at this -- the deposition --

(bringing out the

deposition)

The only copy.

CHARLIE

(coldly)

Let's have it.

BRISTOW

(eagerly)

Here.

PRINCE

What do you want?

BRISTOW

(as Charlie opens the

envelope)

Nothing. I just want to get out of

it. I never had any part of it. This

ought to prove that!

CHARLIE

This?

BRISTOW

(at last)

It's -- it's a trick. I --

(trying to pull himself

together)

I'll see about this! He can't do

this to me!

(moving back towards

the door)

I'll go and see about this!

CHARLIE

Sure, you see about it.

CHARLIE

Take this along.

PRINCE

Something left to wait for?

CHARLIE

(slowly)

No.

HAVEN

Who is it?

MARK'S VOICE

It's me -- Bristow -- let me in.

HAVEN

You going to shoot me, Mark?

BRISTOW

You double crossed me, Haven.

HAVEN

I did?

BRISTOW

I got the deposition back. I took it

to them.

BRISTOW

It wasn't there! It was a piece of

blank paper!

BRISTOW

Don't you laugh at me! I ought to

kill you!

HAVEN

They want you to, Mark.

HAVEN

And it may be your only out, if you

do. But I doubt it. You know why?

Because even if you took them my

scalp, it wouldn't buy your life.

You're in debt and you're broke and

you're scared -- and you know far

too much. There isn't any way they

use you -- alive. Can you think of

one?

BRISTOW

They're going to do it. I know it.

They're going to kill me --

(his hand trembles)

Why do they have to kill me?

HAVEN

Us, Mark...

HAVEN

This must be hers.

BRISTOW

(dully)

Yes.

HAVEN

She's sweet.

HAVEN

There's one thing, Mark.

BRISTOW

(gulping the drink)

There is?

HAVEN

You might get out of town.

BRISTOW

There isn't a chance in a thousand.

HAVEN

If there's one in a million, it's

the only one you have.

BRISTOW

Yes -- we might get away with it. We

might...

HAVEN

I'm not going.

HAVEN

I have to stay.

BRISTOW

But you can't stay. You said yourself --

HAVEN

If you must do this, go straight to

your horse. Don't stop for anything.

BRISTOW

-- I've got a lot of important papers --

HAVEN

You haven't got anything important

left, Mark -- except your life, and

very little time to keep it. You do

it very fast and you might be lucky.

BRISTOW

(trying to pull himself

together)

Yes. I might be. I'll try it.

HAVEN

(softly; turning to

the clerk)

You didn't throw away that verse?

ORVILLE

No.

HAVEN

You won't have to change it much.

ORVILLE

You ain't going out there with that?

HAVEN

Not much, is it?

ORVILLE

You'll never get closer to having

nothin' --

HAVEN

(staring out)

No -- I won't.

ORVILLE

Say --

HAVEN

Yeh?

ORVILLE

I'm naturally sentimental, bein' a

sort of poet.

HAVEN

Naturally.

ORVILLE

I keep a bunch of gimeracks -- an

oldtime sheriff's gun, a bullet from

a dead bandit, a rosary from some

guy they hanged.

HAVEN

That's nice. A hobby?

ORVILLE

In a way -- Want to leave me

something?

HAVEN

This is all I seem to have.

ORVILLE

(taking it)

Army button.

(puzzled)

Where's the uniform that goes with

it?

HAVEN

What do you want for --

(he pauses as the

idea hits him)

Yeh? A very good question.

HAVEN

I might even know. I think I'll try

to go and find out.

SHERIFF

All right, you -- march.

HAVEN

You loaded your gun for this?

SHERIFF

No -- you did.

SHERIFF

Come on, you! Keep moving!

WIPE

FADE OUT

PETE'S VOICE

Where you guys goin'?

MAN

You want them uniforms out, don't

you?

PETE'S VOICE

I'll tell you when.

MAN

What you think you're doin'?

FADE OUT

ILES

That's all right. Just barge right

in! I'm going to tell you something...

HAVEN

(abruptly)

No, you're not. You're going to

listen.

HAVEN

You lost some uniforms? You thought

they were burned?

ILES

They were.

HAVEN

No, they weren't, but they are now

because I just set fire to them.

ILES

(rising)

What's this?

HAVEN

They're smouldering right now in the

warehouse at the sawmill, and there

are about seventy men down there who

were ready to wear them.

ILES

Wear them? What for?

HAVEN

What other reason? To get in the

post and take the gold from you.

HAVEN

You were taking a detachment up north

on an Indian scare?

HAVEN

Well, that scare is a fake. A ruse.

So you know where to send them now.

ILES

Look here, Lieutenant --

HAVEN

Correction.

ILES

Major?

HAVEN

You better get down to that sawmill,

Captain. They may try it anyway.

ILES

I guess I owe you an apology.

HAVEN

(extending his hand)

I'll take it.

MRS. CASLON

I guess I owe you something too.

HAVEN

Only fifty thousand.

MRS. CASLON

I wish there was something I could

say or do.

HAVEN

There is. You can give me back my

gun.

HAVEN

And you can give this one back to

the sheriff.

MRS. CASLON

I'll always remember what a fool I

made of myself.

HAVEN

(smiling)

I always try to forget.

MRS. CASLON

(watching his face)

Are you going too?

HAVEN

Not with them...

DISSOLVE

PRINCE

There's seventy men ready for any

kind of play. I say we can still

swing it -- and get out of town.

CHARLIE

Can we?

PRINCE

You wanted to give Haven time. Well,

he took it.

CHARLIE

You better get out before he takes

you.

PRINCE

By that I presume you intend to

remain.

CHARLIE

(wistfully)

I've been here as long as I remember.

PRINCE

I asked you once if Haven moved me

out.

(he smiles)

I think he's moved us both out --

together.

PRINCE

(softly)

This is the way I wanted it... and

when I've finished you will too...

as though Haven had never been here.

CHARLIE

You cause me an awful lot of trouble.

HAVEN

Yeh... but I finally brought you

something.

HAVEN

You didn't really think Mark would

use it, did you?

CHARLIE

Maybe I just wanted to send you a

gun.

HAVEN

(thoughtfully)

Maybe.

CHARLIE

Isn't it a little late to make any

difference?

HAVEN

It's pretty late.

CHARLIE

Why?

HAVEN

I have to arrest you.

CHARLIE

For what?

HAVEN

Murder.

CHARLIE

I could have killed you from the

window -- but I didn't. And I didn't

kill the two men -- or Goodard.

HAVEN

Who did?

CHARLIE

Maybe Mick -- maybe Prince -- who

knows.

HAVEN

You know.

CHARLIE

You'd almost as soon be killed as

arrest me, wouldn't you?

HAVEN

Almost.

CHARLIE

Which are you -- Wells Fargo or Army?

HAVEN

Army.

CHARLIE

I guess it's my turn to wish you'd

gone to China.

HAVEN

I wish I had too.

CHARLIE

(quietly)

If you still have that gold, and I

think you do, we might make it yet.

You see I believe that every man has

his price.

HAVEN

Some men don't believe that.

CHARLIE

But every woman knows it.

HAVEN

Only there wouldn't be any women on

my jury.

(taking out his pipe)

And that's why you're not as bad off

as you might think... I could find

twelve men who might think you capable

of almost anything -- but I wouldn't

bet they'd vote that way after staring

at you through a trial.

(he notes her eyes go

past him)

Mick is dead for the murders and

Prince can be hung for the rest of

it...

CHARLIE

It's no good...

HAVEN

I'll get someone --

CHARLIE

Stay here.

CHARLIE

Tell me something...

HAVEN

Sure.

CHARLIE

This gets us all. This doesn't count.

HAVEN

(softly)

No...

CHARLIE

Tell me something -- on the square.

CHARLIE

Did you ever -- love me?

HAVEN

All the time.

CHARLIE

(a whisper)

Tell it.

HAVEN

From the first night and the first

time of the song. I tried to get

away from it, but every time it came

back. Every time I tried to get it

out of my brain I just pushed it

deeper into my heart. It had to be

either you or me.

CHARLIE

It's all right. I love you...

(as he looks hard at

her)

Well -- say it.

HAVEN

(softly)

I love you.

CHARLIE

See you... in China.

FADE OUT

THE END
