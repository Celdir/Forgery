BEN

- and today it is right that we

should ask ourselves the one most

important question: What is the

purpose of these years, the purpose

for all this demanding work,

the purpose for the sacrifices

made those who love us?  Were

there NOT a purpose, then all of

these past years of struggle, of

fierce competition and of uncom-

promising ambition would be mean-

ingless.  But, of course, there

is a purpose and I must tell it

to you.  I ask you to remember

this purpose always and I pledge

that I shall endeavor to carry it

with me forever.

Los Angeles weather is clear and the

MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE

What's the matter?

MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE

The guests are all downstairs,

Ben.  They're all waiting to see you.

BEN

Look, Dad - could you explain to

them that I have to be alone for

a while?

MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE

These are all our good friends,

Ben.  Most of them have known you

since - well - practically since

you were born.

MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE

What is it, Ben?

BEN

I'm just -

MR. BRADDOCK

- worried?

BEN

Well -

MR. BRADDOCK

About what?

Ben

I guess - about my future.

MR. BRADDOCK

What about it?

BEN

I don't know.  I want it to be -

MR. BRADDOCK

To be what?

BEN

(quietly)

Different.

MRS. BRADDOCK

Is anything wrong?

MR. BRADDOCK

No!  No - we're just on our way

downstairs!

MRS. BRADDOCK

The Carlsons' are here.

MR. BRADDOCK

(to Mrs. Braddock)

They are?

(to Ben)

Come on.

MRS. BRADDOCK

They came all the way from

Tarzana.

MR. BRADDOCK

It's a wonderful thing to have

so many devoted friends.

29	INT. HALLS AND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

MR. CARLSON

Hey - there's our award winning

scholar.

MRS. CARLSON

We're all very proud of you,

Ben.

BEN

Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

MR. CARLSON

Is that the new car out there?

The little red Wop job?

MR. BRADDOCK

That's Ben's graduation present.

MR. CARLSON

(putting his arm

across Ben's shoulder)

Won't have much trouble picking

them up in that, will you?

BEN

Sir?

MR. CARLSON

The girls.  The chicks.  The -

the teeny boppers.

MRS. CARLSON

I think Ben has gotten beyond

the teeny bopper stage - haven't

you, Ben?

BEN

Yes, ma'am.

BEN

Excuse me - I think I'd just

like to check something on

the car for a minute -

MR. LOOMIS

Here's the track star himself.

How are you, track star?

BEN

Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

MR. LOOMIS

I want to get a drink and then

I want to hear all about that

thing you won.  That Hopperman

award.

BEN

Helpingham.

MR. LOOMIS

Helpingham!  Right!  Now you

wait right here.

LADY 1

Ben - we're all so proud of

you.

LADY 2

Proud, proud, proud, proud,

proud.

LADY 3

What are you going to do now?

BEN

I was going to go upstairs for a

minute -

LADY 3

No - I meant with your future.

LADY 2

With your life.

BEN

Well - that's a little hard to say -

MR. MCQUIRE

Ben!

Ben

(to the ladies)

Excuse me.

Mr. McQuire

MR. MCQUIRE

Yes, sir.

Are you listening?

BEN

Yes I am.

MR. MCQUIRE

(gravely)

Plastics.

BEN

Exactly how do you mean?

MR. MCQUIRE

There is a great future in plastics.

Think about it.  Will you think

about it?

BEN

Yes, I will.

MR. MCQUIRE

Okay.  Enough said.  That's a deal.

WOMAN #1

Excuse me just a minute -

MRS. ROBINSON

Oh.  I guess this isn't the

bathroom, is it?

BEN

It's down the hall.

MRS. ROBINSON

How are you, Benjamin?

BEN

Fine, thank you.  The bathroom is

down at the end of the hall.

BEN

Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't

mean to be rude but -

MRS. ROBINSON

Is there an ashtray in here?

BEN

No.

MRS. ROBINSON

Oh - I forgot.  The track star

doesn't smoke.

MRS. ROBINSON

Is it a girl?

BEN

Is what a girl?

MRS. ROBINSON

Whatever it is you're upset

about.

BEN

Oh - no.  I'm just sort of

disturbed about things.

MRS. ROBINSON

In general.

BEN

That's right.

MRS. ROBINSON

Benjamin, I want to ask you

something.

BEN

What?

MRS. ROBINSON

Will you take me home?

BEN

What?

MRS. ROBINSON

My husband took the car.  Will

you drive me home?

BEN

Here - you take it.

BEN

Do you know how to work a

foreign shift?

BEN

You don't?

MRS. ROBINSON

No.

(there is a pause)

BEN

Let's go.

CUT TO:

33	EXT. BRADDOCK HOUSE - NIGHT

BEN

Dad - Mrs. Robinson needs a ride

home.  I'll be right back.

MRS. ROBINSON

(as she passes the

CAMERA)

Wonderful party.

CUT TO:

34	OMITTED

35	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

MRS. ROBINSON

Thank you.

BEN

Right.

MRS. ROBINSON

Will you come in, please?

BEN

What?

MRS. ROBINSON

I want you to come in till I get

the lights on.

BEN

What for?

MRS. ROBINSON

Because I don't feel safe until

I get the lights on.

36	INT. ROBINSON HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT

MRS. ROBINSON

Would you mind walking ahead of

me to the sun porch.  I feel

funny about coming into a dark

house.

BEN

But it's light in there now.

MRS. ROBINSON

Please.

MRS. ROBINSON

What do you drink?  Bourbon?

BEN

Look - I drove you home.  I was

glad to do it.  But I have some

things on my mind.  Can you

understand that?

BEN

All right then.

MRS. ROBINSON

What do you drink?

MRS. ROBINSON

Benjamin - I'm sorry to be this

way, but I don't want to be

alone in this house.

BEN

Why not?

MRS. ROBINSON

Please wait till my husband

gets home.

BEN

When is he coming back?

MRS. ROBINSON

I don't know.

MRS. ROBINSON

Drink?

BEN

No.

BEN

Are you always this much afraid

of being alone?

MRS. ROBINSON

Yes.

BEN

Well, why can't you just lock

the doors and go to bed?

MRS. ROBINSON

I'm very nuerotic.

MRS. ROBINSON

May I ask you a question?

MRS. ROBINSON

What do you think of me?

BEN

What do you mean?

MRS. ROBINSON

You've known me nearly all of

your life.  You must have

formed some opinion.

BEN

Well - I've always thought

that you were a very - nice -

person.

MRS. ROBINSON

Did you know I was an alcoholic?

BEN

What?

MRS. ROBINSON

Did you know that?

BEN

Look - I think I should be

going -

MRS. ROBINSON

Sit down, Benjamin.

BEN

Mrs. Robinson - if you don't

mind my saying so - this

conversation is getting a

little strange.  Now I'm sure

that Mr. Robinson will be here

any minute and -

MRS. ROBINSON

No.

BEN

What?

MRS. ROBINSON

My husband will be back quite

late.

MRS. ROBINSON

He should be gone for several

hours.

BEN

Oh my God.

MRS. ROBINSON

Pardon?

BEN

Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

MRS. ROBINSON

What's wrong?

BEN

Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -

I mean you didn't expect -

MRS. ROBINSON

What?

BEN

I mean - you didn't really

think that I would do something

like that.

MRS. ROBINSON

Like what?

BEN

What do you think?

MRS. ROBINSON

Well I don't know.

BEN

For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson,

here we are, you've got me into

your house.  You give me a

drink.  You put on music, now

you start opening up your

personal life to me and tell

me your husband won't be home

for hours.

MRS. ROBINSON

So?

BEN

Mrs. Robinson - you are trying

to seduce me.

BEN

(weaker)

Aren't you?

MRS. ROBINSON

Why no.  I hadn't thought of it.

I feel rather flattered that

you -

BEN

Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive

me for what I just said?

MRS. ROBINSON

It's all right.

BEN

It's not all right, it's the

worst thing I've ever said

to anyone.

MRS. ROBINSON

Sit down.

BEN

Please forgive me.  Because I

like you.  I don't think of you

that way.  But I'm mixed up.

MRS. ROBINSON

All right.  Now finish your drink.

BEN

Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick

that I said that to you.

MRS. ROBINSON

We'll forget it right now.

Finish your drink.

BEN

What is wrong with me?

MRS. ROBINSON

Have you ever seen Elaine's

portrait?

BEN

Her portrait?

MRS. ROBINSON

Yes.

BEN

No.

MRS. ROBINSON

We had it done last Christmas.

Would you like to see it?

BEN

Very much.

37	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

BEN

Elaine certainly is an

attractive girl, isn't she?

BEN

(looking at the

portrait)

I don't remember her as having

brown eyes.

MRS. ROBINSON

Benjamin?

BEN

Yes?

MRS. ROBINSON

Will you unzip my dress?

MRS. ROBINSON

I think I'll go to bed.

BEN

Oh.  Well, goodnight.

MRS. ROBINSON

Won't you unzip my dress?

BEN

I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

MRS. ROBINSON

If you still think I'm trying

to seduce you -

BEN

No, I don't.  But I just feel

a little funny.

MRS. ROBINSON

Benjamin - you've known me all

your life.

BEN

I know that.  But I'm -

MRS. ROBINSON

Come on.

MRS. ROBINSON

It's hard for me to reach.

MRS. ROBINSON

Thank you.

BEN

Right.

MRS. ROBINSON

What are you so scared of?

BEN

I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

MRS. ROBINSON

Then why do you keep running

away?

BEN

Because you're going to bed.  I

don't think I should be up here.

MRS. ROBINSON

Haven't you ever seen anybody

in a slip before?

BEN

Yes, I have -

BEN

But I just - Look - what if Mr.

Robinson walked in right now?

MRS. ROBINSON

What if he did?

BEN

Well, it would look pretty

funny, wouldn't it?

MRS. ROBINSON

Don't you think he trusts us

together?

BEN

Of course he does.  But he

might get the wrong idea.

Anyone might.

MRS. ROBINSON

I don't see why.  I'm twice as

old as you are.  How could

anyone think -

BEN

But they would!  Don't you see?

MRS. ROBINSON

Benjamin - I'm not trying to

seduce you.  I wish you'd -

BEN

I know that.  But please, Mrs.

Robinson.  This is difficult

for me.

MRS. ROBINSON

Why is it?

BEN

Because I am confused about

things.  I can't tell what

I'm imagining.  I can't tell

what's real.  I can't -

MRS. ROBINSON

Would you like me to seduce you?

BEN

What?

MRS. ROBINSON

Is that what you're trying to

tell me?

BEN

I'm going home now.  I apologize

for what I said.  I hope you can

forget it.  But I'm going home

right now.

MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE

BENJAMIN?

BEN

Yes.

MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE

Will you bring up my purse before

you go?

BEN

I have to go now.  I'm sorry.

MRS. ROBINSON

I really don't want to put this

on again.  Won't you bring it

up?

BEN

Where is it?

MRS. ROBINSON

On that chair in the hall.

BEN

Mrs. Robinson?

MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE

I'm in the bathroom.

BEN

Well here's the purse.

MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE

Could you bring it up?

BEN

Well I'll hand it to you.

BEN

Come to the railing and I'll

hand it up.

MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE

Benjamin - I am getting pretty

tired of all this suspicion.

Now if you won't do me a simple

favor I don't know what.

BEN

I'm putting it on the top step.

MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE

For God's sake, Benjamin, will

you stop acting that way and

bring me the purse?

BEN

I'm putting it here by the door.

MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE

Will you bring it in to me?

BEN

I'd rather not.

MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE

All right.  Put it in the room

where we were.

BEN

Right.

38	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

BEN

Oh God.

BEN

Let me out.

MRS. ROBINSON

Don't be nervous.

BEN

Get away from that door.

MRS. ROBINSON

I want to say something first.

BEN

Jesus Christ!

MRS. ROBINSON

Benjamin - I want you to know

I'm available to you.  If you

won't sleep with me this time -

BEN

Oh my God.

MRS. ROBINSON

If you won't sleep with me this

time, Benjamin, I want you to

know you can call me up any

time you want and we'll make

some kind of arrangement.

BEN

Let me out!

MRS. ROBINSON

Do you understand what I said?

BEN

Yes.  Yes.  Let me out!

MRS. ROBINSON

Because I find you very attractive

and any time -

39	INT. SUNROOM - NIGHT

MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE

Is that Ben's car in front?

BEN

(jumping up)

Yes, sir!

BEN

I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson

home.  She wanted me to drive

her home so I - I drove her home.

MR. ROBINSON

Swell.  I appreciate it.

BEN

She's upstairs.  She wanted me

to wait down here till you got

home.

MR. ROBINSON

Standing guard over the old

castle, are you?

BEN

Yes, sir.

MR. ROBINSON

Here.  It looks like you need

a refill.

BEN

Oh no.

MR. ROBINSON

What?

BEN

I've got to go.

MR. ROBINSON

Is anything wrong?  You look

a little shaken up.

BEN

No.  No - I'm just - I'm just

a little worried about my

future.  I'm a little upset

about my future.

MR. ROBINSON

Come on.  Let's have a nightcap

together.

BEN

Thank you very much, sir.

MR. ROBINSON

Ben - how old are you now?

BEN

Twenty.  I'll be twenty-one

next week.

MR. ROBINSON

(taking out a

cigarette)

That's a hell of a good age

to be.

BEN

Thank you.

MR. ROBINSON

I wish I was that age again.

Because, Ben -

BEN

Sir?

MR. ROBINSON

You'll never be young again.

BEN

I know.

MR. ROBINSON

Ben, can I say something to

you?

BEN

What?

MR. ROBINSON

How long have we known each

other now?

MR. ROBINSON

How long have you and I known

each other?  How long have

your Dad and I been partners?

BEN

Quite a while.

MR. ROBINSON

I've watched you grow up, Ben.

BEN

Yes, sir.

MR. ROBINSON

In many ways I feel as though

you were my own son.

BEN

Thank you.

MR. ROBINSON

So I hope you won't mind my

giving you a friendly piece

of advice.

BEN

I'd like to hear it.

MR. ROBINSON

Ben - I think - I think you

ought to be taking it a little

easier right now than you seem

to.

MR. ROBINSON

Sow a few wild oats.  Take things

as they come.  Have a good time

with the girls and so forth.

MRS. ROBINSON

Don't get up.

MR. ROBINSON

I was just telling Ben here he

ought to sow a few wild oats.

Have a good time while he can.

You think that's sound advice?

MRS. ROBINSON

Yes, I do.

BEN

I've got to go.

MR. ROBINSON

You have yourself a few flings

this summer.  I bet you're

quite a ladies' man.

BEN

Oh no.

MR. ROBINSON

What?  You look like the kind

of guy that has to fight them

off.

(to Mrs. Robinson)

Doesn't he look to you like

the kind of guy who has to

fight them off?

MRS. ROBINSON

Yes, he does.

40	INT. ROBINSON HALL - NIGHT

MR. ROBINSON

Oh say - Elaine gets down from

Berkeley on Saturday.

Great.

you're paying attention.  A

events ever to take place in

this particular backyard.

MR. BRADDOCK

round of applause to bring this

MR. BRADDOCK

Just hang on a minute because

I have a few words to say -

BEN'S VOICE

Dad - could we just talk about

years spent accomplishing some

rather extraordinary things at

one of our nation's leading

seats of learning -

MR. ARNOLD

Bring him out!

PETER AND LOUISE

show!

MR. BRADDOCK

(to the window)

I can't hold them much longer,

Ben.  You better get out here.

BEN'S VOICE

I'd like to discuss this.

MR. BRADDOCK

(to his audience)

This boy - I'm sorry - this

young man - is soon to continue

his education as a Frank Halping-

ham Award Scholar - but before

he does -

MR. BRADDOCK

- before he does -

(to the window)

You're disappointing them, Ben.

You're disappointing them.

BEN'S VOICE

Dad - can you listen -

MR. BRADDOCK

(meaning it)

I'll give you ten seconds.

(back to the

people)

He is going to give us a

practical demonstration of

please.

Will you sign the register,

Is anything wrong, sir?

Luggage?  Yes.  Yes.  I do.

ROOM CLERK

Where is it?

BEN

What?

ROOM CLERK

Where is your luggage?

BEN

Well it's in the car.  It's

out in the car.

ROOM CLERK

Very good, sir.  I'll have a

porter bring it in.

BEN

Oh no.

ROOM CLERK

Sir?

BEN

I mean I'd - I'd rather not

go to the trouble of bringing

it all in.  I just have a

toothbrush.  I can get it my-

self.  If that's all right.

ROOM CLERK

Of course.

ROOM CLERK

I'll have a porter show you the

room.

BEN

Oh.  Well actually, I'd just as

soon find it myself.  I just have

the toothbrush to carry up and

I think I can manage it myself.

MRS. ROBINSON

Well - do you want to go up first?

BEN

Yes - I think that would be good.

MRS. ROBINSON

I'll be up in five minutes.

Well - goodbye then -

MRS. ROBINSON

Yes?

MRS. ROBINSON

Isn't there something you want to

MRS. ROBINSON

Yes.

BEN

Well - I want you to know how much

I appreciate this - really -

MRS. ROBINSON

The number.

BEN

MRS. ROBINSON

The room number, Benjamin.  I think

you ought to tell me that.

Oh?  You're absolutely right.  Absolutely.

MRS. ROBINSON

Oh - sure.  Thank you.

MRS. ROBINSON

A hanger.

Oh - yes.  Wood?

Wood or wire?  They have both.

MRS. ROBINSON

Either one will be fine.

Okay.

Certainly.

MRS. ROBINSON

Mrs. Robinson - I can't do

MRS. ROBINSON

You what?

BEN

This is all terribly wrong.

MRS. ROBINSON

Benjamin - do you find me undesirable?

BEN

Oh no, Mrs. Robinson.  I think -

I think you're the most attractive

of all my parents' friends.

I just don't think we could

possibly --

MRS. ROBINSON

Are you afraid of me?

BEN

No - but look - maybe we could

do something else together,

Mrs. Robinson - would you like

to go to a movie.

MRS. ROBINSON

Benjamin, is this your first time?

BEN

Is this - what?

MRS. ROBINSON

It is, isn't it?  It is your

first time.

BEN

That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.

That's really a laugh.  Ha ha.

MRS. ROBINSON

You can admit that, can't you?

BEN

Are you kidding?

MRS. ROBINSON

It's nothing to be ashamed of -

Would you  mind telling me then -

what were those four years of

college for?  What was the point

of all that hard work?

BEN

You got me.

MR. BRADDOCK

(trying unsuccessfully

to control himself)

Now listen, Ben.  I think it's

a very good thing that a young

man - after he's done some very

good work - should have a chance

to relax and enjoy himself, and

lie around, and drink beer and

so on.  But after a few weeks

I believe that person would

want to take some stock in him-

self and his situation and start

to think about getting off his

ass.

MRS. BRADDOCK

The Robinson's are here.

MR. ROBINSON

Hi, Ben.  What are you doing with

yourself these days?

BEN

Oh - not too much.  Taking it

easy.

MR. ROBINSON

That's what I'd do if I could.

Nothing wrong with that.  Hey

Ben, Elaine's coming down from

Berkeley soon.  I want you to

call her up this time.

I will.

you do when you go off at night.

BEN

When I go off?

MRS. BRADDOCK

You don't have to tell me if

you don't want.

BEN

No, I do.  I want to tell you.

BEN

I drive around.

MRS. BRADDOCK

What else?

BEN

Nothing else.

MRS. BRADDOCK

Well you don't drive around from

midnight until noon the next

day, Benjamin.

BEN

Oh, no.

MRS. BRADDOCK

Then what do you do?  Do you

meet someone?

BEN

Meet someone?

BEN

Why did you say that?

MRS. BRADDOCK

Well this is your business,

Benjamin.

(she starts toward

the door)

If you -

BEN

No wait.  Wait.

BEN

I don't meet anyone, mother, but

why did you say that?

MRS. BRADDOCK

Benjamin, I'm not going to pry

into your affairs, but I'd

rather you didn't say anything

at all than be dishonest.

Goodnight, Benjamin.

BEN

Well, wait.

BEN

You think I'm being dishonest?

BEN

Well why do you - why do you

think that?

MRS. BRADDOCK

Because I know you don't drive

around for twelve hours.

BEN

Oh.  Well, I don't.  Shall I

tell you what I do?

MRS. BRADDOCK

Not if you don't want to.

BEN

I do.

MRS. BRADDOCK

But I don't want you to make

up something.

BEN

I'm not.  But I'm - I'm not very

proud of what I do.  I usually

get kind of drunk.  I usually

drive over to Los Angeles and

go to some bars and get kind of

drunk.  Then I take a hotel

room.  So I won't have to drive

home on the freeway.  I mean it

kind of scares me to drive home

after -

MRS. BRADDOCK

Goodnight, Benjamin.

BEN

Now - do you think we could say

a few words to each other first

this time?

MRS. ROBINSON

If you want.

BEN

Good.  I mean are we dead or

something?

MRS. ROBINSON

Well I just don't think we have

much to say to each other.

BEN

All we ever do is come up here

and throw off the clothes and

leap into bed together.

MRS. ROBINSON

Are you tired of it?

BEN

I'm not.  No.  But do you think

we could liven it up with a

few words now and then?

MRS. ROBINSON

Well what do you want to talk

about?

BEN

Anything.  Anything at all.

MRS. ROBINSON

Do you want to tell me about

some of your college experiences?

BEN

Oh my God.

MRS. ROBINSON

Well?

BEN

Mrs. Robinson.  If that's the best

we can do let's just get the god-

damn clothes off and --

BEN

Leave it on!  Now we are going to

do this thing.  We are going to

have a conversation.  Think of

another topic.

MRS. ROBINSON

How about art.

BEN

Art.  That's a good subject.

You start it off.

MRS. ROBINSON

You start it off.  I don't know

anything about it.

BEN

Oh.

MRS. ROBINSON

Don't you?

BEN

Yes I do.  I know quite a bit

about it.

MRS. ROBINSON

Go ahead then.

BEN

Art.  Well what do you want to

know about it.

BEN

Are you interested more in modern

art or more in classical art.

MRS. ROBINSON

Neither.

BEN

You're not interested in art?

MRS. ROBINSON

No.

BEN

Then why do you want to talk

about it?

MRS. ROBINSON

I don't.

MRS. ROBINSON

Can I take off my clothes now?

BEN

No.  Think of another topic.

Tell me what you did today.

MRS. ROBINSON

Do you really want me to?

BEN

Yes I do.

MRS. ROBINSON

I got up.

MRS. ROBINSON

Do you want to hear it or not?

BEN

Yes.  But you might try and spice

it up with a little originality.

MRS. ROBINSON

I got up.  I ate breakfast and

went shopping.  During the after-

noon I read a novel.

BEN

What one.

MRS. ROBINSON

What?

BEN

What novel did you read.

MRS. ROBINSON

I don't remember.

MRS. ROBINSON

Then I fixed supper for my husband

and waited until -

BEN

There!

MRS. ROBINSON

What?

BEN

Your husband!  Mrs. Robinson!

There's something we could have

a conversation about.

MRS. ROBINSON

Him?

BEN

I mean everything.  I don't know

anything about how you - how you

work this.  I don't know how you

get out of the house at night.  I

don't know the risk involved.

MRS. ROBINSON

There isn't any.

BEN

There's no risk?

BEN

How do you get out of the house?

MRS. ROBINSON

I walk out.

BEN

You walk right out the door.

BEN

What do you say to him?

MRS. ROBINSON

He's asleep.

BEN

Always?

MRS. ROBINSON

Benjamin, this isn't a very

interesting topic.

BEN

Please.  Now tell me.  How do

you know he won't wake up

sometime and follow you.

MRS. ROBINSON

Because he takes sleeping pills.

He takes three sleeping pills

every night at ten o'clock.

BEN

But what about the noise from

the car.  What if -

MRS. ROBINSON

The driveway's on my side of

the house.

BEN

(smiling)

We're talking.

MRS. ROBINSON

What?

BEN

We're talking, Mrs. Robinson.

We're talking.

MRS. ROBINSON

Calm down, Benjamin.

BEN

Now let's keep going here.

MRS. ROBINSON

Can I undress and talk at the

same time?

BEN

Right.

MRS. ROBINSON

Thank you.

BEN

Now.  You say the driveway's on

your side of the house.  So I

guess you don't sleep in the

same room.

MRS. ROBINSON

We don't.

BEN

So you don't - I mean I don't

like to seem like I'm prying

but I guess you don't sleep

together or anything.

MRS. ROBINSON

No we don't.

BEN

Well how long has this been going

on.

MRS. ROBINSON

(looking at the

ceiling for a moment)

About five years.

BEN

Oh no.  Are you kidding me?

MRS. ROBINSON

No.

BEN

You have not slept with your

husband for five years?

MRS. ROBINSON

Now and then.  He geats drunk a

few times a year.

BEN

How many times a year.

MRS. ROBINSON

On New Year's Eve.  Sometimes on

his birthday.

BEN

Man, is this interesting.

MRS. ROBINSON

Is it?

BEN

So you don't love him.  You

wouldn't say you -

MRS. ROBINSON

We've talked enough, Benjamin.

BEN

Wait a minute.  So you wouldn't

say you loved him.

MRS. ROBINSON

Not exactly.

BEN

But you don't hate him.

MRS. ROBINSON

No, Benjamin.  I don't hate him.

Unhook my blouse.

BEN

(unhooking her blouse)

Well how do you feel about him,

then?

MRS. ROBINSON

I don't.

BEN

Well that's kind of a bad

situation then, isn't it?

MRS. ROBINSON

Is it?

BEN

I mean it doesn't sound like it

could be much worse.  If you

hated him at least you'd hate

him.

BEN

Well you loved him once, I

assume.  When you first knew

him.

MRS. ROBINSON

No.

BEN

What?

MRS. ROBINSON

I never did, Benjamin.  Now

let's -

BEN

Well, wait a minute.  You married

him.

BEN

Why did you do that?

MRS. ROBINSON

(taking off her

stockings)

See if you can guess.

BEN

Well I can't.

MRS. ROBINSON

Think real hard, Benjamin.

BEN

I can't see why you did, unless

...you didn't have to marry him

or anything, did you?

MRS. ROBINSON

Don't tell Elaine.

BEN

Oh no.  You had to marry him

because you got pregnant?

MRS. ROBINSON

Are you shocked?

BEN

Well I never thought of you and

Mr. Robinson as the kind of

people who...

MRS. ROBINSON

All right.  Now let's get to bed.

BEN

Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

So how did it happen?

MRS. ROBINSON

What?

BEN

I mean do you feel like telling

me what were the circumstances?

MRS. ROBINSON

Not particularly.

BEN

Was he a law student at the time?

BEN

And you were a student also.

MRS. ROBINSON

Yes.

BEN

At college.

MRS. ROBINSON

Yes.

BEN

What was your major?

MRS. ROBINSON

Why are you asking me all this?

BEN

Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.

Now what was your major subject

at college?

MRS. ROBINSON

Art.

BEN

Art?

BEN

But I thought you - I guess you

kind of lost interest in it over

the years then.

MRS. ROBINSON

Kind of.

BEN

Well how did it happen?

MRS. ROBINSON

How do you think.

BEN

I mean did he take you up to

his room with him?  Did you go

to a hotel?

MRS. ROBINSON

Benjamin, what does it possibly

matter?

BEN

I'm curious.

MRS. ROBINSON

We'd go to his car.

BEN

Oh no.  In the car you did it?

MRS. ROBINSON

I don't think we were the first.

BEN

What kind of car was it?

MRS. ROBINSON

What?

BEN

Do you remember the make of the

car?

MRS. ROBINSON

Oh my God.

BEN

Really.  I want to know.

MRS. ROBINSON

It was a Ford, Benjamin.

BEN

(jumping up)

A Ford!  A Ford!  Goddamnit, a

Ford!  That's great!

MRS. ROBINSON

That's enough.

BEN

So old Elaine Robinson got started

in a Ford.

MRS. ROBINSON

Don't talk about Elaine.

BEN

Don't talk about Elaine?

MRS. ROBINSON

No.

BEN

Why not?

MRS. ROBINSON

Because I don't want you to.

BEN

Well why don't you?

BEN

I wish you'd tell me.

MRS. ROBINSON

There's nothing to tell.

BEN

Well why is she a big taboo

subject all of a sudden?

BEN

Well - I guess I'll have to ask

her out on a date and find out

what's --

MRS. ROBINSON

Benjamin, don't you ever take

that girl out.

MRS. ROBINSON

Do you understand that?

BEN

Well look.  I have no intention

of taking her out.

MRS. ROBINSON

Good.

BEN

I was just kidding around.

MRS. ROBINSON

Good.

BEN

But why shouldn't I?

MRS. ROBINSON

I have my reasons.

BEN

Then let's hear them.

MRS. ROBINSON

No.

BEN

Let's hear your reasons, Mrs.

Robinson.  Because I think I

know what they are.

BEN

I'm not good enough for her to

associate with, am I?  I'm not

good enough to even talk about

her, am I?

MRS. ROBINSON

Let's drop it.

BEN

We're not dropping it.  Now

that's the reason, isn't it?

I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't

I?  I'm not fit to -

MRS. ROBINSON

Benjamin?

BEN

I'm good enough for you but I'm

too slimy to associate with

your daughter.  That's it, isn't

it?  ISN'T IT?

MRS. ROBINSON

Yes.

BEN

You go to hell.  You go straight

to hell, Mrs. Robinson.  Do you

think I'm proud of myself?  Do

you think I'm proud of this?

MRS. ROBINSON

I wouldn't know.

BEN

Well, I'm not.

MRS. ROBINSON

You're not.

BEN

No sir.  I am not proud that I

spend my time with a broken-

down alcoholic!

MRS. ROBINSON

I see.

BEN

And if you think I come here

for any reason besides pure

boredom, then you're all wrong.

BEN

Because - Mrs. Robinson this

is the sickest, most perverted

thing that ever happened to

me.  And you do what you want

but I'm getting the hell out.

MRS. ROBINSON

Are you?

BEN

You're goddamn right I am.

MRS. ROBINSON

That's how you feel about me.

MRS. ROBINSON

That I'm a sick and disgusting

person.

BEN

Now don't start this.

MRS. ROBINSON

What?

BEN

Don't start acting hurt.

MRS. ROBINSON

Don't you expect me to be a

little hurt?

BEN

Mrs. Robinson, you stand there

and tell me I'm not good enough

for your daughter.

MRS. ROBINSON

Did I say that?

BEN

Of course you did.

MRS. ROBINSON

Benjamin, I want to apologize

to you if that's the impression

you got.

BEN

Well two minutes ago you told

me I wasn't good enough for

your daughter.  Now you say

you're sorry I got that

impression.

MRS. ROBINSON

I didn't mean it.  I don't think

you'd be right for each other.

But I would never say you

weren't as good a person as

she is.

BEN

You wouldn't.

MRS. ROBINSON

Of course I wouldn't.

BEN

What are you doing?

MRS. ROBINSON

Well it's pretty obvious you

don't want me around any more.

BEN

Well look - I was kind of upset

there.  I'm sorry I said those

things.

MRS. ROBINSON

If that's how you feel -

BEN

But it's not.

MRS. ROBINSON

(smiling at him)

That's all right.  I think I

can understand why I'm disgusting

to you.

BEN

Oh no.  Look - I like you.  I

wouldn't keep coming here if

I didn't like you.

MRS. ROBINSON

But if it's sickening for you -

BEN

It's not!  I enjoy it!  I look

forward to it.  It's the one

thing I have to look forward

to.

MRS. ROBINSON

You don't have to say that.

BEN

Well I wouldn't.  I would never

say it if it wasn't true.

MRS. ROBINSON

May I stay then?

BEN

Yes. Please.  I want you to.

MRS. ROBINSON

Thank you.

BEN

Well don't thank me, because I

want you to.

MRS. ROBINSON

But you won't ever take out

Elaine, will you?  I want you

to promise me that.

BEN

Look.  Why the hell did you

bring this up.  It never

occured to me to take her out.

MRS. ROBINSON

Then give me your word you won't.

BEN

This is absurd.

MRS. ROBINSON

Promise me, Benjamin.

BEN

All right, for christ's sake.

I promise I will never take

out Elaine Robinson.

MRS. ROBINSON

Thank you.

guess your evenings, whatever

you do with them, are just too

Why don't I just drag you

off?  All right - I will.

Right after we get the blood

tests.

ELAINE

Well - I have to see Carl first.

BEN

Carl who?

BEN

Carl who?

ELAINE

Carl Smith.  He's a medical

student.  We've known him

for years.

BEN

Who - that guy at the Zoo?

ELAINE

Yes.

BEN

Why do you have to see him?

ELAINE

Well -- I said I might marry him.

BEN

No, Benjamin.

Well, what did he say?  I'm curious.

ELAINE

He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.

BEN

Oh no.  He said that.

ELAINE

Shhhh.

BEN

Where did he do it?

BEN

I'd like to know where it happened?

MR. ROBINSON

(clearing his throat)

Do you want - do you want to try

and tell me why you did it?

BEN

Mr. Robinson?

MR. ROBINSON

Do you have a special grudge

against me?  Do you feel a particularly

strong resentment for me?

BEN

No, it's not --

MR. ROBINSON

Is there something I've said that's

caused this contempt?  Or is it just

the things I stand for that you

despise?

BEN

It was nothing to do with you, sir.

MR. ROBINSON

Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to

do with me.

BEN

Now look - please -

MR. ROBINSON

Ben, I think we're two civilized

human beings.  Do you think it's

necessary to threaten each other?

BEN

I am not threatening you.

MR. ROBINSON

Do you want to unclench your fists,

please?  Thank you.  I can see in

the dark, you know.  I've been here

quite a while.

BEN

I am trying to tell you I have no

personal feelings about you, Mr.

Robinson.  I am trying to tell

you I do not resent you.

MR. ROBINSON

You don't respect me terribly

much either, do you?

BEN

No, I don't.

MR. ROBINSON

Well, I don't think we have a

whole lot to say to each other,

Ben.  I do think you should know

the consequences of what you've

done.  I do think you should

know that my wife and I are

getting a divorce soon.

BEN

But why?

MR. ROBINSON

Why?

BEN

It shouldn't make any difference

what happened.

MR. ROBINSON

That's quite a statement.

BEN

Listen to me.  We got - we got

into bed with each other.  But

it was nothing.  It was nothing

at all.  We might - we might just

as well have been shaking hands.

MR. ROBINSON

Shaking hands.  Well, that's not

saying much for my wife, is it?

BEN

You miss the point.

MR. ROBINSON

Don't shout at me, Ben.

BEN

The point is - I don't love your

wife.  I love your daughter, sir.

MR. ROBINSON

Well - I'm sure you think you do,

Ben, but after a few times in

bed with Elaine I feel quite sure

you'd get over that as quickly

as you -

BEN

HUH?

MR. ROBINSON

I think I've talked about this

enough.  I don't know how far

I can go, Ben.  I don't know if

I can prosecute or not, but I

think maybe I can.  In the light

of what's happened I think maybe

I can get you behind bars if you

ever look at my daughter again.

I have seen Elaine and I have

spent the afternoon taking steps

to insure...

MR. ROBINSON

Stay away from me, Ben!

MR. ROBINSON

I don't want to mince words with

you.  As far as Elaine's concerned

you're to get her out of your

filthy mind right now.  Is that

perfectly clear ro you?  That's

all, Ben.  You'll pardon me if

I don't shake hands with you.

MR. ROBINSON

I think you are filth.

MR. ROBINSON

I think you are scum.

MR. ROBINSON

You are a degenerate!
