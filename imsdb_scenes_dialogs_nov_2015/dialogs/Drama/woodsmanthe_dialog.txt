MAN (0.S.)

So. How are you adjusting?

WALTER

I'm adjusting okay.

MAN (O.S.)

And your new apartment?

WALTER

Apartment's okay.

MAN (O.S.)

Are you taking your medication?

WALTER

It gives me headaches.

MAN (O.S.)

But you are taking it?

WALTER

Yeah.

ROSEN

Good. I'll talk to your physician

about the headaches. Maybe he can

change the prescription.

ROSEN (cont'd)

And how's your job?

WALTER

The job's okay.

(CONTINUED)

ROSEN

Do I take "okay" to mean you feel

good about working there?

WALTER

I said the job is okay.

ROSEN

(smiling)

That's right, you did.

pause)

Have you made any friends there?

WALTER

I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.

ROSEN

(pause)

You seem a little hostile today.

WALTER

That was a joke.

WALTER (cont'd)

It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.

ROSEN

No need to call me doctor. I'm a

therapist, not a psychiatrist.

WALTER

It's all the same.

ROSEN

Walter, I'd like you to try

something for me.

WALTER

What?

(CONTINUED)

7.

ROSEN

I'd like you to keep a journal.

WALTER

A diary?

ROSEN

That's right.

WALTER

No way.

ROSEN

Why not?

WALTER

Diaries have sent too many guys to

prison.

ROSEN

I don't understand.

WALTER

Ev-i-dence.

ROSEN

Oh. It never crossed my mind.

WALTER

Of course.

ROSEN

It was just an idea.

WALTER

Bad idea.

ROSEN

I thought a journal would encourage

you to reflect.

WALTER

Reflect.

ROSEN

That's right.

(CONTINUED)

8.

WALTER

You think reflection is good.

ROSEN

It's very good, indeed.

WALTER

How's that?

ROSEN

By reflection we can derive a

deeper meaning from our experience

in life. We gain greater

understanding about ourselves that

can lead to making better choices

in our relationships, our careers,

and our goals.

WALTER

You read that in a book.

ROSEN

Try it.

WALTER

No fucking way.

ROSEN

Then think about it.

9.

WALTER

There a problem?

MALE PHARMACIST

problem?

WALTER

Can you read the prescription?

MALE PHARMACIST

Yes.

WALTER

Can you fill the prescription?

FEMALE PHARMACIST

Yes.

WALTER

Then I suggest one of you move your

ass, because if I don't get my

medication I get extremely violent.

CARLOS (O.S.)

You still think fast.

WALTER

Don't need to think fast to handle

beer.

CARLOS

ook some talking to convince your

super I was a relative.

WALTER

I told her all my relatives are

good-looking.

CARLOS

Jesus Christ, man, it's good to see

you!

CARLOS (cont'd)

You look good, damn good,

considering you're an old man now!

WALTER

Seems like the whole world's gotten

younger.

(CONTINUED)

11.

CARLOS

You doing okay?

WALTER

Got a job at old Frank's place. His

son runs it now.

CARLOS

Oh man, that kid takes himself real

serious.

WALTER

Yeah, you still with Northland?

CARLOS

(grins)

Foreman now.

WALTER

No shit.

CARLOS

Five years.

WALTER

Beautiful. How's business?

CARLOS

Booming. Lots of building going on.

We can't keep up with all the work.

In fact, I just hired a few new

guys...

CARLOS (cont'd)

Just until we catch up.

CARLOS (cont'd)

I'll never forget you got me

started there.

(CONTINUED)

12.

WALTER

I just recommended you. You still

had to prove yourself.

CARLOS

Hey, is that a school?

WALTER

K through sixth.

CARLOS

Living across the street from a

grade school. Jesus.

WALTER

Something wrong with that?

CARLOS

I was just thinking of... the

noise.

WALTER

I like the noise.

WALTER (cont'd)

One hundred and twenty feet.

CARLOS

What?

WALTER

Law says I can't come within one

hundred feet of where children

congregate. I figure the distance

from my window to the school is one

hundred and twenty. Make a bet?

CARLOS

No way, man, you'd rob me blind!

(CONTINUED)

C

13.

CARLOS (cont'd)

But maybe it's not so healthy being

so close, you know, to a school.

WALTER

(heated)

You find me a decent place for

under three hundred a month in this

town, and I'll happily move out of

this crap neighborhood.

arlos shrugs and tosses down the rest of his beer.

CARLOS

I should go. Your sister worries,

and when she worries she yells.

WALTER

How is she?

CARLOS

Annette? She's good... tense.

WALTER

When can I see her?

CARLOS

I'm working on it.

WALTER

Is it because of Anna?

CARLOS

I don't know. She won't talk about

it.

WALTER

(pause)

You're the only one in the family

who still talks to me.

(CONTINUED)

CARLOS

I remember when they all referred

to me as "the little spic poor

Annette married." Except her

brother. You treated me with

respect.

pause)

Look, you paid your dues. Your

slate is clean now.

WALTER

How old is Anna?

CARLOS

She'll be twelve next week. We're

throwing a big party on Saturday.

Wish I could ask you to come...

WALTER

Only if it's no closer than a

hundred feet.

Sorry, bad joke.

People without cars.

Very weird.

No weirder than a sharp, young,

good-looking woman working in a

lumberyard.

What's weird about that?

Most women wouldn't choose it.

Guess I'm not like most women.

You never spoke to me before.

I thought you were a dyke.

WALTER (cont'd)

(smiling)

Are you?

VICKI

What do you think?

VICKI

Southern light.

WALTER

What?

VICKI

Your windows face south. Northern

light is the purest. But southern

light is very good.

WALTER

I'll buy a plant.

VICKI

Y

ou should buy several. I've got

shitty light in my place, but my

plants don't seem to mind. Light's

important, but it's not everything.

Sorry.

Thanks.

Doesn't it get noisy?

WALTER

I like the noise.

VICKI

My place faces a truck street. I've

got cracks in every window from the

shaking.

WALTER

You must hate it.

I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself

in the wilderness for a week or

two.

What about them?

They could eat you.

VICKI

Yeah, they could.

VICKI (cont'd)

I thought you were just shy, but

now I think it's something else.

WALTER

What?

VICKI

You're damaged.

VICKI (cont'd)

Something happened to you.

WALTER

Yeah?

icki sits next to him.

VICKI

I'm not easily shocked.

WALTER

I get that Vimpression.

VICKI

So... what's your dark secret?

WALTER

Why do you want to know?

VICKI

Don't you think I should know

before we have sex?

VICKI (cont'd)

I don't like to waste time.

No.

Do you?

It's been a while since...

Since you've had sex?

How about in the morning.

What for?

VICKI

Well, Walter, this is going to

sound off-the-wall, but I like to

sleep with a man after we fuck.

VICKI (cont'd)

Did I say something wrong?

WALTER

I suffer from insomnia.

VICKI

Is that all?

WALTER

When I do sleep, I sweat a lot.

Usually I get nightmares and wake

up screaming.

I sleep like a dead horse. Anything

else?

I'm still thinking about it.

ROSEN

I wish you'd give it a try.

You don't like coming here, do you?

WALTER

It's okay.

ROSEN

But you don't like coming here. Be

honest, Walter.

WALTER

Honest? No.

ROSEN

Good. That's an honest answer. And

why don't you like coming here?

WALTER

Honest? Your cheery personality

makes my skin itch.

ROSEN

(stung)

Is it just my cheery personality

that makes your skin itch?

WALTER

Forget it.

ROSEN

Maybe it's the way I look. Or the

sound of my name.

WALTER

Rosen? I don't have a problem with

that.

ROSEN

Because if you did, I know a

therapist named Ryan. I also know a

therapist named Chung.

WALTER

I don't need someone else.

Fine.

But for the last few weeks I've

noticed someone else watching them.

I'd keep away from him.

VICKI

What?

MARY-KAY

The new man. I'd keep away from

him, if I were you.

VICKI

Why's that?

MARY-KAY

You don't want to know, but he's

damaged goods -- real damaged

goods, if you know what I mean.

VICKI

(cold)

Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do.

Thanks a bunch for the advice.

MARY-KAY

Just trying to be helpful.

VICKI

Well, Mary, you're about as helpful

as a broken sewer pipe. You do know

what runs out of a sewer pipe,

don't you?

MARY-KAY

Suit yourself.

VICKI

Hey.

VICKI

Hey, there.

WALTER

Hi.

VICKI

What happened to you?

VICKI (cont'd)

Walter, what did you do?

(CONTINUED)

WALTER

Why do you want to know?

VICKI

Because I like you.

VICKI (cont'd)

I won't run away.

here's a long pause. He rests back down against the pillows.

WALTER

What's the worst thing you ever

did?

VICKI

The worst?

WALTER

Yeah.

VICKI

Fucked my best friend's husband.

VICKI (cont'd)

I mean my best friend since the

second grade. Her husband was hot

for me and, god, he was cute. She

was an international flight

attendant, so we would get it on

for days, while she was off in some

country we couldn't pronounce. Then

he told her, the shit. It broke up

our friendship, broke up their

marriage. Later she had a nervous

breakdown, quit her job, then moved

in with her sister who she

despised.

(CONTINUED)

35.

VICKI (cont'd)

I still feel like the lowest piece

of shit, when I think about it.

VICKI (cont'd)

So, what did you do?

WALTER

I molested little girls.

VICKI

Molested little girls?

WALTER

Yeah.

WALTER (cont'd)

You don't believe me?

WALTER (cont'd)

I wish the judge had your sense of

humor.

VICKI

You're not joking.

WALTER

Twelve years in prison is no joke.

WALTER (cont'd)

(signaling to the door)

Look, you can go now.

(CONTINUED)

36.

VICKI

How many girls did you molest?

WALTER

Obviously one too many.

(bitter laugh)

WALTER (cont'd)

Sorry.

VICKI

What did you do to them?

WALTER

(looking back out the window)

It's not what you think.

VICKI

How young?

WALTER

Between ten and twelve. Once a nine-

year-old told me she was eleven.

Once a fourteen-year-old told me

she was twelve. I always asked how

old they were.

icki is visibly shaken. She puts the cigarette out.

VICKI

So it was mostly fondling? Shit

like that?

WALTER

I never hurt them. Never.

VICKI

Twelve years in prison?

(CONTINUED)

37.

WALTER

The judge had a thing about sex

offenders. Later I heard his

daughter had been raped. If I

hadn't had a good lawyer, it would

have been twenty-five to thirty.

WALTER (cont'd)

Why don't you just go now, okay?

VICKI

I told you I'm not easily shocked.

WALTER

You should be shocked. Or do you

get off on this shit?

VICKI

What?

WALTER

Get your kicks somewhere else.

VICKI

Hey, I'm not --

WALTER

Depraved? My mistake.

VICKI

Walter.

WALTER

Get the fuck out of here!

VICKI

You don't molest little girls

anymore, do you?

WALTER

No. Never again.

icki looks away, struggling to digest the news.

You should go now.

WALTER

What are you doing?

CARLOS

his little table is one heavy

bitch.

C

C

WALTER

herry.

CARLOS

Huh?

WALTER

It's made from cherry. That's a

hard wood.

CARLOS

It's a nice table.

WALTER

Notice the grain. See how deep and

rich the red runs?

CARLOS

Yeah. It's really nice.

WALTER

It's my own design. You won't find

another table like it in the world.

CARLOS

It was a beautiful present.

W

WALTER

Then why the fuck are you giving it

back to me?!

CARLOS

(gesturing to the empty space)

You need a table.

WALTER

wasn't she? Just toss it like a

scrap of wood.

CARLOS

It wasn't like that.

WALTER

Then what? What?!

CARLOS

he's got all this new furniture

now. She said it didn't fit

anymore, so I kept it in the attic.

I thought you might like it.

WALTER

I made that table for you and

Annette, for your wedding. I put a

lot of love into it.

CARLOS

I know, man. I love this table too.

(Looks at Walter)

But I also love my wife.

CARLOS (cont'd)

What's happening?

WALTER

Mariners are pounding the shit out

of the Tigers.

Fucking Mariners.

The birthday party.

Oh,   Anna's. It was great, man. Anna

was   so pretty.

She   looked like a princess, like

one   of those girls in a fairy tale,

No thanks.

I don't want to see any goddamn

pictures.

party.

I want to see my sister and Anna in

person. Okay?

CARLOS

Yeah, man, I understand.

ROSEN

How do you feel about that?

WALTER

I don't feel anything.

R

OSEN

You have no feelings for your

niece?

WALTER

She was born after they put me

away. How can I have feelings?

ROSEN

Then why are you talking about

this?

WALTER

Have to talk about something.

ROSEN

What are you afraid will happen?

(CONTINUED)

43.

WALTER

I'm not afraid. I'm just saying

that Carlos has a thing for his

daughter, and if he isn't careful

he's going to suffer.

ROSEN

Have you talked to Carlos about

your concerns?

WALTER

I'm not that crazy.

ROSEN

Do you think you're crazy?

WALTER

If I'm not, then what the hell am I

doing here?

ROSEN

Why do you think you're here?

WALTER

You know why. It's part of the

parole deal.

ROSEN

Is that what you are angry about?

WALTER

Talking to you is like riding on a

merry-go-round.

ROSEN

That is a marvelous image, Walter.

Because by going in circles we find

the things we missed the first time

around.

WALTER

How long is this going to take?

ROSEN

We have a few more minutes.

WALTER

I mean, when will I be normal.

ROSEN

We have a lot of work to do.

WALTER

(speaking slowly)

Will I ever be normal?

ROSEN

I couldn't say.

WALTER

You couldn't say.

ROSEN

I'm afraid not.

WALTER

Do you know what "normal" is?

R

OSEN

I suppose it's however society

defines it.

WALTER

How do you define it?

ROSEN

I don't.

WALTER

Then how do you know if your

patients are getting better?

ROSEN

They usually tell me.

WALTER

How do they know?

Why don't we continue this on

Thursday.

Prison is... time.

No. Prison is time. That's it. You

think time, you feel time, you hear

time. Your heart doesn't beat to

live, it just beats... time.

I'm sorry, Walter.

Don't be sorry for me. I did those

things. No one else did. I'm

dealing with that.

My father took me fishing here when

I was a kid. He could name every

fish in the lake. And for every

fish he named, he had a fishing

story. I hated fishing, but I loved

his stories.

Why young girls, Walter?

Is it their innocence? Their

beauty?...

They seduce you?

I want you to change my mind!

VICKI (cont'd)

Try, goddamnit!

WALTER

I had this plan once... or maybe it

was a dream. I was going to quit

the building business... open my

own shop. Make and design fine

country furniture. I had saved

enough money. I found the perfect

place. Cheap five-year-lease. The

loan was in the bag. My wife was a

hundred percent behind it.

Everything was set... Then I got in

trouble.

trouble is?

It's trouble you bring on

yourself... and the people you love

commonly overlooked. Most people

only notice birds with the

brightest colors.

WALTER (cont'd)

What's your name?

WALTER (cont'd)

Linda... Susan... Jennifer...

Jackie..

WALTER (cont'd)

You tell me your name, I'll tell

you mine.

GIRL

Robin.

ROBIN

Yeah, like the bird.

99.

WALTER

(pause)

Can I ask how old you are?

ROBIN

I'm twelve.

WALTER

No you're not.

ROBIN

I will be in three months.

(pause)

I can't wait. I hate being eleven.

It has to be the stupidest age in

the world.

ROBIN (cont'd)

What's your name?

WALTER

Walter.

ROBIN

Do you have many friends?

WALTER

No.

ROBIN

How come?

WALTER

A long time ago, I was sent far

away. When they let me come back,

all my friends were gone.

ROBIN

It sounds like you were banished.

WALTER

Banished... yeah.

(CONTINUED)

100.

ROBIN

Birds are my friends. That sounds

egotistical, but they are. Birds

know I watch them, but they don't

mind because they like being

watched... if they know you won't

hurt them.

WALTER

Robin?

ROBIN

Yes?

WALTER

Would you like to sit on my lap?

ROBIN

What?

WALTER

Would you like to sit on my lap?

ROBIN

(pause)

No thank you.

WALTER

Are you sure?

ROBIN

I'm sure. Thank you all the same.

WALTER

That's okay... doesn't matter.

ROBIN

(pause)

Do you want me to sit on your lap?

WALTER

Yes. I would enjoy that.

(CONTINUED)

101.

WALTER (cont'd)

Are you cold?

WALTER (cont'd)

You look cold.

WALTER (cont'd)

I know a place in the park where

only very small birds go. There are

no people or dogs or ugly crows and

pigeons. It's quiet except for the

song of these tiny sparrowlike

birds. Would you like me to take

you there?

ROBIN

(pause)

They sound like finches.

WALTER

They could be finches. I don't

know. We should go before it gets

dark.

WALTER (cont'd)

Ready?

ROBIN

My daddy lets me sit on his lap.

WALTER

Does he?

ROBIN

Yes.

(CONTINUED)

102.

WALTER

Do you like it when he asks you?

ROBIN

No.

WALTER

Why not?

WALTER (cont'd)

Are you two alone when he asks you?

WALTER (cont'd)

Does he touch you?

WALTER (cont'd)

Does he say strange things?

WALTER (cont'd)

Does he move his legs in a funny

way?

WALTER (cont'd)

Have you told your mother?

(CONTINUED)

103.

WALTER (cont'd)

Is there anyone at home you can

talk to?

WALTER (cont'd)

Is there a teacher you like at

school?

WALTER (cont'd)

What's her name?

ROBIN

Ms. Kramer.

WALTER

Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy

does.

ROBIN

I can't.

WALTER

Yes you can, Robin.

WALTER (cont'd)

You said you couldn't make the

sound of a solitary vireo. But you

did. Beautifully. I heard you.

ROBIN

What will happen if I do?

WALTER

Someone will talk to your daddy.

And then he'll stop doing those

things... the things you don't

like.

(CONTINUED)

104.

ROBIN

But will he... ?

WALTER

Your daddy will always love you.

ROBIN

How do you know?

WALTER

I know because... it's just

something I know.

ROBIN

I don't want to hurt my daddy.

WALTER

Robin, listen to me.

WALTER (cont'd)

At first he'll be upset... very

upset. It's because he'll realize

he's been a bad daddy. Then he'll

try... He'll try very hard to be a

good daddy... People will say

stupid, ignorant things about your

daddy. That will be hard for you...

But one thing I know for sure,

he'll always love you... always.

ROBIN

Walter?

WALTER

Yes?

ROBIN

Do you still want me to sit on your

lap?

(CONTINUED)

105.

ROBIN (cont'd)

I will.

WALTER

No.

ROBIN

I don't mind.

WALTER

You should go home.

ROBIN

Can't I stay a little longer?

WALTER

It's getting dark. Go home.

ROBIN

Will I see you again?

WALTER

Go home, Robin.

ROBIN

Bye.

Hi ya, Walter.

WALTER

What can I do for you, Sergeant

Lucas?

LUCAS

You don't know?

WALTER

Know what?

LUCAS

I'll be asking the questions.

(pause)

Last night, you hear anything

unusual? Screams? Shouts?

WALTER

No.

(CONTINUED)

LUCAS

man was badly beaten across the

street. You know anything about

that?

WALTER

I was asleep.

LUCAS

(pause)

I didn't say what time the assault

occurred.

WALTER

You said last night. I went to bed

pretty early.

LUCAS

The assault took place at

approximately seven thirty.

WALTER

I went to bed around seven.

WALTER (cont'd)

I wasn't feeling well.

LUCAS

I could take you downtown.

WALTER

You could. It'd be a waste of your

time, though.

LUCAS

There was a boy there.

(CONTINUED)

111.

LUCAS (cont'd)

He I.D.'d the assailant. The

description matches you pretty

well.

WALTER

I suppose if you're looking for a

male between the ages of thirty and

fifty, medium height, medium

weight, medium build. Probably not

too many men fit that bill.

LUCAS

Just give me a straight answer,

Walter, cause the irony goes right

over my head.

LUCAS (cont'd)

That's a nasty scratch on your

neck.

WALTER

I have a passionate girlfriend.

LUCAS

What's with the boxes?

WALTER

You're a cop. Figure it out.

LUCAS

I'd say you're moving.

WALTER

It's a free country, isn't it?

WALTER (cont'd)

Just kidding. I'm moving in with my

girlfriend.

(CONTINUED)

112.

LUCAS

The passionate one?

WALTER

Yes.

LUCAS

Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.

WALTER

I count my blessings.

LUCAS

Well, I guess I'll be seeing you.

WALTER

Think you'll catch this guy?

LUCAS

Oh, yeah. We'll catch him.

Unfortunately, the victim can't

talk. In addition to his other

injuries, his jaw is broken.

LUCAS (cont'd)

However, we ran an I.D. on the

victim. Turns out he's wanted in

Pennsylvania. He raped a boy there.

LUCAS (cont'd)

You sure you don't know nothing

about this?

WALTER

`Fraid not.

(CONTINUED)

LUCAS

Stay out of trouble, Walter. Cause

I'll be watching you.

You okay?

Yeah.

VICKI

Fucking liar.

Hey, look.

I saw my sister.

It was hard.

She's still really hurt... and

angry. I don't know... if she will

ever... forgive me.

I understand that. I do. I just

hope... I just want her to...

ROSEN

Accept you?

ROSEN (cont'd)

It's going to take time, Walter.

WALTER

(to himself)

Time.

ROSEN

How do you feel about that?

WALTER

I feel... okay.
