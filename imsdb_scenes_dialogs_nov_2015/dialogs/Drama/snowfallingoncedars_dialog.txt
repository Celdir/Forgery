SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS

Ronald Bass

First Draft Screenplay

March 3, 1997

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

It was the first murder trial on

the island in thirty-one years.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Our only newspaper was the San

Piedro Review, a four-page weekly

that I operated alone.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

What, I wondered, could the Seattle

boys know of the hearts of these

people...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Neighbors, sitting in judgement.

On their neighbor.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Kabuo Miaymoto sat with the rigid

grace of a Samurai warrior.  As if

detached from his own trial.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Did he know how dangerous his demeanor

could be?  With this jury.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Hatsue Miyamoto had been without

her husband for 77 days.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

He was in jail.  When his baby son

learned to walk.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Earlier, I noticed her in the

corridor.

ISHMAEL

Are you all right?

HATSUE

Go away, Ishmael.

ISHMAEL

Please don't be like th...

HATSUE (softer)

Go away.

HOOKS

...four inch gash, skull crushed,

and your thought was, what...?

HOOKS (O.S.)

That he...fell?  Hit his head on

the gunnel going over?

MORAN

Well, Carl was six-four, went 235.

He was a grizzly bear and an able

seaman...

MORAN (O.S.)

For him to just...go over.  Crush

his skull like that on the way in...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

He was a mountain, all right.

Anchored the line for us little

fellers.

CARL

Chambers.  Y'see the geese?

CARL

Picture'd be nice.  In your pa's

paper.

ISHMAEL

Lucky I got the camera in my

helmet.

CARL

Careful, Chambers.  That was almost

a joke.

HOOKS

And you weren't there, when the

coroner examined the wound.

MORAN

Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid...

to tell Mrs. Heine.

MORAN

Hey there, men.  Is your mother

home a-tall?

SUSAN MARIE (O.S.)

Sheriff Moran, hullo.

MORAN

You go on and play, now.

SUSAN MARIE

What can I do for you, Sheriff,

Carl's not home y...

MORAN

That's...

MORAN

It's why I'm here.  I'm afraid I

have some...very bad news to tell

you, the...worst...kind of news.

MORAN

Carl died last night.  In a fishing

accident.  In White Sand Bay.

SUSAN MARIE

No, Carl's fine, h...

MORAN

We found him, Mrs. Heine.  Tangled

in his net.

SUSAN MARIE

I told him this could happen.

HOOKS

So, no...immediate suspicion,

no...general talk of enmity

between the two.

MORAN

These are fishermen, Alvin.  They

don't talk at all to each other

and less to me.  Specially gossip.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

A gill-netter works through black

nights with only himself to talk

to.  And learns to be silent.

They were lonely men and products

of geography.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

...men who, on occasion, realized

that they wished to speak, but

couldn't.

MORAN

Figure you'da heard by now.

GJOVAAG

You go fishing, it happens.

ISHMAEL (to Moran)

You see Susan Marie?

MORAN

I did.  Boy.

ISHMAEL

Three kids.  What's she going to do?

GJOVAAG (disgusted)

Well, what

can

she do?  Jesus Christ.

ISHMAEL

Excuse me, Gjovaag.

GJOVAAG

I don't need to excuse nothin'.

Fuck you anyhow, Chambers.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Like the Sheriff, I did not work

the sea, and could never merit trust.

Or respect.

MARTY JOHANSSON

Sheriff's been askin' which boats

followed Carl out last night...

MORAN (quickly)

Only to see if somebody talked to

him out th...

ISHMAEL

So who talked to him?  Out there.

JAN SORENSEN (heavy Danish)

So far, we figured the guys who went

to Ship Channel Bank, was Jim Ferry,

Hardwell, Moulton, Miyamoto...

GJOVAAG (spits)

Japs.

MORAN

All right, look, if you see these

boys...

GJOVAAG

Never saw you so hard-ass, Art.

Ain't this just an accident?

MORAN

Course it is, but a man's dead,

William.  I got to write my report.

MORAN

I'm not gonna see some article

about an investigation, am I?

ISHMAEL (quietly)

You want me to lie?

MORAN

No, I wanna be off the damn record,

that's what I want.

MORAN

I mean, if there is a killer, why

would you want him all alerted?

ISHMAEL

Let's say...someday

I

need some

cooperation from

you

on this thing.

Do I get it?

NELS (O.S.)

No sign of a struggle, you say.

MORAN

Well, the coffee cup was layin' right

in the

middle

of the floor, like I

said.  And with a fella so neat as

Carl, that did seem peculiar.

NELS

As peculiar as a struggle between

a 235 pound man, and an assailant

strong enough to subdue him...that

leaves only a

single

overturned

cup

in its wake?

HOOKS (O.S.)

Objection, asking the witness to

speculate.

NELS

My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to

object every time you did that?

JUDGE (wearily)

That's quite enough horseplay,

Nels, why don't you act your age?

NELS

If I did that Your Honor, I'd

be dead.

JUDGE

Any more homely loveable tricks,

and you'll be worse than that.

Proceed, gentlemen.

HOOKS

There's an objection, Your H...

JUDGE

And it's overruled, answer the

question.  If you can recall it.

MORAN

Maybe the assailant straightened

the cabin.  And forgot the cup.

NELS

Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.

MORAN

Maybe.

NELS

I think you testified

all

the

lights were on.  Cabin, mast,

net lights, picking lights...

MORAN

Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.

NELS

And yet you started the engine

right up.  With all those lights

drawing all night, the batteries

had that much charge.  Did that

strike you odd?

MORAN

Didn't think about it at the time.

So no, it didn't strike me odd.

NELS

Does it now?

MORAN

A little.  Yes.  You have to

wonder.

NELS

You have to wonder.

NELS

You found three batteries, you

say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well.

And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor.

Correct?

MORAN

It is.

NELS

Now I did some measuring down at

the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch

wider than a D-8.  It would be too

large for the deceased's well.

MORAN

He's done some on-the-spot refit-

ting.  You could see the side flange

was banged away to make room for

the D-6.

NELS

But he had a spare D-6, you said.

Right there.  Why not use that?

MORAN

It was dead.  We had it tested.

Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he

had to use it.

NELS

Maybe he carried a spare that

was too large to fit.  So he'd

have to bang out the flange to

squeeze it in?

NELS

Sheriff, how many batteries and

what size did you find on

defendant's

boat?

MORAN

Two D-6's.  That's the kind his

well was fitted for.

NELS

No spare.

MORAN

No.

NELS

So the defendant went out fishing

for the night with

no

spare battery,

hmmn?

MORAN

Apparently.

NELS

I'm curious.  The D-6 that was

refitted into the deceased's well.

Was it exactly the same brand and

model as defendant's?

MORAN

I believe so.

NELS

Now you've testified that the

deceased was a heavy man, and hard

to bring out of the net.

NELS

Is it possible his head struck the

transom, or the stern gunnel, or the

net roller, as you were bringing him

in?

MORAN

I don't think so.

NELS

You don't.

Think

so.

MORAN

He was heavy, but we were real

careful.  But I don't remember him

hitting anything, anywhere.

NELS

You don't.

Remember

.

NELS

Operating this winch you'd rarely

operated before, doing this awkward

job of bringing in a drowned man of

235 pounds...is it

possible

.  Possible

that he struck his head

after

death.

Possible?

MORAN

Possible.  But not darn likely.

NELS (turns to jury)

No further questions.

HOOKS

...so when the sheriff returned,

you showed him the injury to the

deceased's head.

WHALEY

He said, 'Could it be somebody hit

him?'  And I said, 'You want to play

Sherlock Holmes, here?'

HOOKS

Did you say more?

WHALEY

I said that if I was playing Sherlock

Holmes...I'd maybe look for a...

Japanese person.  With a bloody gun-

butt.  A right-handed fella, to be

precise.

HOOKS

And why.  Is that?

WHALEY

Well, I was a doctor in the Jap

theater, in the war.  I saw those

kendo wounds,

many

times.  Looked

exactly like this one.

HOOKS

Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?

WHALEY

Japanese stick-fighting.  They're

trained as kids, y'know.  To kill

with sticks.

HOOKS (O.S.)

No further questions.

ZENHICHI

Hips, stomach,

cut

.  Stomach muscles

tighten as stroke advances...

ZENHICHI

Elbow soft, or there is no follow-

through.  You cut your bokken off

from the power of your body, unl...

ZENHICHI

Hips sink more.  Less weight on the

heels, so tha...

ZENHICHI (very quiet)

Zenshin.  Is constant awareness.

Of dang...

ZENHICHI

Elbow soft.  A little better.

ZENHICHI

You can be good with the bokken.

If you begin to concentrate.

ZENHICHI

You must choose now, Kabuo.  At eight

years.  If you want this.

KABUO (boldly)

I

want

it.

ZENHICHI

Then speak quietly.  So you may be

heard.

NELS (O.S.)

So this...foam you found in the

lungs.  How does it get there?

WHALEY

As I testified.  It occurs when

water, mucus and air are mixed by

respiration.  I believe I said that.

NELS (slightly confused)

But a drowned person can't breathe.

WHALEY

Of course not.  The foam means

that he went

in

breathing.

WHALEY

That's

why

the autopsy report

identifies

drowning

as the cause

of death.

NELS

Meaning that he wasn't murdered

first, say on the deck of the boat,

and then thrown overboard.

WHALEY

Well...

NELS

Your report says death by

drowning

,

which means he went into the water

alive and breathing.  And the report

is accurate...?

WHALEY (bristles)

Of

course

it's accurate, but...

NELS

Of course, it is.  Now as to the

head injury.  You say made by an

object narrow and flat.  That is

your

inference

, correct?

WHALEY (really pissed)

It's my

job

to infer, that's what

coroners do.  You get hit with a

crowbar, or a ball-peen hammer, or

fall off a motorcycle, the injuries

look different, that's my area of

expertise.

NELS

In your motorcycle example.  Those

injuries are produced by the head

being propelled

against

an object.

Rather than the reverse, yes?

WHALEY

Obviously.

NELS

Can you tell whether an object moved

against the head, or the other way

around?  Or would both look the same.

WHALEY

The same.

NELS

So if his head struck something

narrow and flat, the gunnel of a

boat, a net roller, a fairlead,

could that have...

WHALEY

If the head was moving fast enough,

but I don't see how it could be.

NELS

Is it possible?

WHALEY

Sure, anything's poss...

NELS

Is it fair to say that you do not

know for

certain

which it was.

WHALEY

I already said that, b...

NELS

And

that you can't say for

certain

whether the head injury was

sustained before or

after

death?

WHALEY

For certain, no.

NELS

But you are

certain

that he died

by drowning.

WHALEY

For the third time, yes.

WHALEY

Can I say something, here?

NELS

Yes, you can tell me about the

minor cut you found on the deceased's

right hand.  The report says 'recent

origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24

hours before death?

WHALEY

Absolutely not.  Probably one or two

hours.  Four at the most.

NELS

Are you absol...

WHALEY

Yes

, I'm sure.

NELS

Thank you, Horace.  No more

questions.

JUDGE

We'll take our luncheon recess.

Reconvene at...2 o'clock sharp.

KABUO

How are the kids?

HATSUE

They need their father.

KABUO

Well.  Just a few more days.

ABEL (coughs)

Look, Art's gonna want me t...

KABUO (ignoring him)

You look beautiful.

HATSUE

I look terrible.  Don't sit so

straight like Tojo's soldier.  The

jury will be afraid of you.

KABUO

Okay, I'll hide under the table

from now on.  That make you happy?

KABUO

I'm not going until you smile.

HATSUE

They'll hear everything.

KABUO (loud)

There must be

something

good on

the radio!

KABUO (louder)

Wouldn't some

music

be nice?

HATSUE

Ishmael.  See the yellow one?

KABUO (loud)

Can the music be

louder

, please?

We can't hear so good in here!

KABUO

Have you ever done this?

HATSUE

Never.  You're my only.

HATSUE

...so right.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Course, we grew up together.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Her mom had this Mrs. Shigemura

come on Wednesdays.  Teach her

how to be Japanese.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Dances, calligraphy.  Doing her hair.

How to sit without moving...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

She would tell me stories of

this woman and her lessons.  As

if complaining, or at least ex-

plaining her world...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

But I always fantasized.  The

lessons were for me.

MRS. SHIGEMURA

No.  You must never look at a man

directly.  This is

part

of grace.

HATSUE

I don't think the boys on this

island.  Are impressed.  By grace.

MRS. SHIGEMURA

Hakujin know nothing of life, Hatsue.

MRS. SHIGEMURA

This is why they fear death.  Because

life here is separate from Being.

MRS. SHIGEMURA

It is why they have no soul.

MRS. SHIGEMURA

Life embraces death, includes it.

This truth brings tranquility.  You

must see yourself...

HATSUE

...as a leaf.  On a great tree.

MRS. SHIGEMURA

The pin.  Could be better placed.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

My lessons came from my father.  They

were different.  Or seemed so, at the

time.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

He operated the Review alone, with

an integrity and passion for principle

that made him a figure of respect.  If

slightly larger than life.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

He never spoke of wanting me to

succeed him.  And, in truth, it was

the last job on earth I thought I'd

ever want.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

When I was five, he casually mentioned

that if his sleeve got caught in the

press, he'd be instantly popped open

like a child's balloon, and splattered

across the walls.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Even his bones would disappear, to

be discovered later on the floor,

as strips of white confetti.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Which, of course, made me certain that

life would have no meaning until I

could run that teakettle.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

He was, for better or worse, the

only God in my life.  I guess it's

our nature to resent those we know

we can never measure up to...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

...which keeps us from accepting

the warmth.  The way we should.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Every summer, after harvest, the

Strawberry Festival was Dad's favor-

ite story to cover.  Good news was

his preference.  Making him an oddity

among journalists.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Highlight was crowning the Strawberry

Princess.  Always a Japanese girl,

sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice

to the concept of racial harmony.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Senior Year.  It was Hatsue.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

She winked at me.  In public.

Which was unusual.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I had kissed her once, when we

were ten.  Looking at fish through

a glass-bottomed box.  It was just

an impulse, and no big deal.

HATSUE

He's still got a good grip.  We

need to dig more.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

At school, she kept mostly to the

Japanese kids, and sort of ignored

me.  As if all of our times alone

together...in the hollow cedar,

everywhere...were a secret.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I told myself that was good.  That

it made our friendship special.  And

didn't mean she was ashamed of it.

Necessarily.

HATSUE

Easy.  Slow is best.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I thought about her.  Sometimes,

all the time.  I knew I was unhappy.

But I knew if I told her...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

It might be a mistake.  I could

never correct.

ISHMAEL (quietly)

I like you.

ISHMAEL

Do you know what I mean, Hatsue?

I've always liked you.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I knew in my heart that we would

love each other forever.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

The way she kissed me.  She knew

it, too.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

She avoided me for a week.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

So this way, I could see her

without...bothering anyone.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I was certain everything would

work out.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

And frightened.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

By two weeks, I knew I had made

the defining mistake of my life.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I'd ruined everything.

HATSUE

You followed me, huh?

ISHMAEL

Sorry.  It sort of...happened, I

just...I followed you.  I'm sorry.

HATSUE

I'm all wet.

ISHMAEL

I'm sorry I kissed you on

the beach.

ISHMAEL

Let's just forget about it.

Forget it happened.

HATSUE

Don't be sorry.  I'm not sorry

about it.

ISHMAEL

Me neither.

HATSUE

Do you think this is wrong?

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

The best part was that there was a

'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.

ISHMAEL

Your friends would.  Your dad would

kill me with a machete.

HATSUE

We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael.

He'll slice you up with a ceremonial

sword.

HATSUE

My mom.  Would be the problem.

ISHMAEL

Why?  We're only talking.

HATSUE (softly)

Sure.

HATSUE

I can't hear you.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

We kissed for half an hour, that

first time.  And I knew there would

never be another day like it.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

No matter how long I lived.

HOOKS (O.S.)

...you were acquainted with the

defendant

and

his family.

ETTA

Him and his folks and two brothers

and two sisters worked our land.

Lived in a picker's cabin at first.

HOOKS

So the defendant knew the deceased,

your son, even then.

ETTA

They fished t'gether.  Went to school.

Carl Junior treated him like a white

person.  Like any friend.

HOOKS

But the dispute began.  With the

father, yes?

ETTA

Don't sell, Carl.  You'll regret it.

CARL SR.

Only seven acres, and the worst

seven, at that.  They're decent

folks.  They got five hunnerd to

put down

now

.

ETTA

Don't go wavin' new church clothes

at me.  We're not such paupers as

sell to Japs, are we?  For what, a

pouch of fancy pipe tobacco?

CARL SR.

They work hard, live clean, don't

spend nothin'.  Even kind to the

Indjuns.  People is people, comes

down to it.

ETTA

You wear the pants, doncha?  Go

ahead, sell our land to a Jap and

see what comes of it.

HOOKS

But back in '34, Japanese-born

could not

own

land.  So...?

ETTA

Carl held it

for

'em.  Called it

a lease.  They make payments every

June and December...

HOOKS

Why?  If they could never take title.

ETTA

Their kids was born here.  So when

the oldest, that one there, was

twenty...last payment gets made,

and he could own it.

ETTA

But they missed their last two

payments.  So that was that.

ETTA (V.O.)

March 1942, orders came down.  Japs

had eight days before the Army was

gonna cart 'em off.

CARL SR. (softly)

Eight days.  It ain't right.

ZENHICHI

We must leave everything.  If you

like, you can work our fields, sell

berries, keep the money.  Otherwise,

they just rot.

ETTA (V.O.)

Japs are shrewd.  Offer berries he

can't use.  Soften us up about those

two payments still to come.

ZENHICHI

Today, I have $120 toward next paym...

CARL SR.

Absolutely not, Zenhichi.  I'm not

gonna take your savings at a time

like this.

ZENHICHI

Please, you take.  Then, I send more

from where I'm going.  If not enough,

you still have seven acres strawber...

ETTA

Thought you was

givin

' us those.

ETTA

Didn't you come in here givin' them

away?  Now you want $130,

after

our

labor and fertilizer.  Is

that

what

you come here hopin' on?

ETTA (V.O.)

I spit on him, and he's pretending

it didn't happen that way.  How could

anyone trust people like that?

ETTA

You want more coffee?

ZENHICHI

No, thank you.  Take money, please.

CARL SR.

Etta's been rude to you, and I

apologize for that.  You keep this

money, and those payments will work

out fine.  Somewhere down the road.

CARL JR.

Look at this!

CARL JR.

Kabuo loaned it to me.  Til he

gets back.

CARL JR.

It's great for sea-run cutthroat.

The ferrules are smooth, silk wrapped.

ETTA

Take that back.  And do it now.

CARL JR.

I told Kabuo I'd take ca...

ETTA

Those Japs owe us.  I don't want

nothin' confusing that.

ETTA

I said now, boy.  Supper's in

forty minutes.

CARL SR.

We ain't right together.

CARL SR.

You and me.  We just ain't right.

HOOKS

You said neither of the last two

payments were made.  But your husband

told defendant's father that he could

pay them...what, 'down the road'.

ETTA

Road ended October 1944, when my

husband passed away.

ETTA

I sold all the land to our

neighbor, Ole Jurgensen.  Got

a fair price, this time.

And

...

ETTA

Sent

all

their equity back to those

Japs down in California.  Which I

didn't

have

to do.  Specially since

my boy was out in the Pacific, gettin'

shot at by Japs at the time.

HOOKS

Now defendant's father had also

died by that point.  Where was

the defendant?  When you sent

his family their equity.

ETTA

In the war.  Europe, I believe.

They could hardly send him to the

Pacific, could they?

HOOKS

And when he came home.  Did he

write you about this?  Or phone,

perhaps.

ETTA

Just showed up at my door, big as

life and twice as mean.  Wanted to

talk to my son.

ETTA

He's over the ocean, fighting the

Japs.  They're just about licked.

KABUO (quietly)

Just about.

ETTA

When Mr. Heine passed away, I

couldn't farm the place myself,

could I?  You're gonna have to talk

to Ole abou...

KABUO

I just did.  He didn't know we were

one payment away.  You didn't tell

him Mr. Heine promised my fath...

ETTA

I was s'posed to

tell

him there's

some illegal contract muddling things

up?  You folks didn't make your pay-

ments.  In America, bank comes in and

repossesses your land.  I didn't do

anything wrong.

KABUO

Nothing illegal.  Wrong is a

different mat...

ETTA

Get out of here.

KABUO

You sold our land out from under

us, Mrs. Heine.  You took advantage

of the fact that we were gone.  You...

HOOKS

What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?

ETTA

Well.  Every time I see him in

town or somewhere, he's starin'

at me with these narrow eyes.

Givin' me his mean face.

HOOKS

When your son came back from the

war, what did he say about all this?

ETTA

That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto.

Watch out for him.

HOOKS

Did he see some

danger

from defen...

NELS

Objection.  Asking witness to

speculate about deceased's state

of mind.

HOOKS

All right.  What did your son

say

to that effect?

ETTA

He said he wished Kabuo would forget

about his seven acres, and stop

lookin' at us cross-eyed.

HOOKS

Your witness.

NELS

Just three questions.  The Miyamoto

family bought your seven acres for

$4500?

ETTA

Tried to.  Defaulted on their

payments.

NELS

Second question.  What did Ole

Jurgensen pay you per acre?

ETTA

A thousand.

NELS

So that makes what would have been

$4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If

you sent the equity back, you had

a profit of $2500.

ETTA

Is that your third question?

NELS

It is.

ETTA

You done your math right.

NELS

You, too.  No further questions.

HOOKS

Were those his

exact

words?

OLE (shaky)

He say Mrs. Heine robbed him.

Mr. Heine never woulda let no

such ting like that hap...

HOOKS

Robbed.  He was angry.

OLE

Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would

get his land back.

HOOKS

Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to

buy

the seven acres from you?

OLE

Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year

ago, I had my healt, I wasn't

wantin' to sell.

HOOKS

And then your stroke came this

summer.  And you put your property

on the market, I believe you said

September 7.  Which, remember, is

eight

days before Carl Heine died.

And who comes Spetember 7, wanting

to buy?

OLE

Carl Heine came.

HOOKS

But Carl was a fisherman.  And

successful at it.

OLE

He said he didn't want that life

no more.  He'd been saving to buy

a farm.  He was sorry I got sick.

But pretty excited to get back his

father's place.

OLE

Liesel and me.  Was happy for him.

HOOKS

And later, that

same

day.  Only

eight

days before Carl Heine died.

Did another prospective buyer appear?

LIESEL

I'm sorry to tell you, we took his

earnest money, he shook Ole's hand.

Come November, he'll sell his boat,

and take over the farm.

KABUO

But your sign...

OLE

We din't have no time to take it down.

He just come ten o'clock.

KABUO

It's my fault.  I should have come

earlier.

OLE

If you want t'buy them seven

acres.  Carl Heine's the only

fella can sell 'em.

JUDGE

I apologize for keeping you folks

from your families in a storm like

this.  I do hope you'll be reasonably

comfortable in the hotel tonight.  And

one more thing...

JUDGE

This Court takes judicial notice of

the fact that tomorrow is the 13th

anniversary of the attack on Pearl

Harbor.

JUDGE

Which has

no

relationship to this

trial.  Which is why I mention it.

JUDGE

10 o'clock tomorrow, folks.  Stay

warm.

ISHMAEL

Know where it is?

ISHMAEL

It's in my other hand.

ISHMAEL

Your mother went to the bathroom.

She said I could show them a trick.

FOUR-YEAR-OLD

HE DOESN'T

HAVE

A OTHER HAND!

HATSUE

Thank you for your help.

(to the girls)

Let's go find obaasan.

ABEL

This is from Nels, I can't see the

harm.  Don't tell Art, okay?

MORAN

This here is Nels Gudmundsson,

he's your attorney.

KABUO

What makes you think I play?

NELS

Your daddy played.  I asked, down

at the Japanese Community Center.

You smoke cigars?

KABUO

I'm not sure.  I better check

down at the Center.

NELS

White or black?

KABUO

You mean, do I like to take the

offensive?  Or hang back and wait.

NELS

Nice.  When two fellas understand

each other.

KABUO

You must think I like losing.

NELS

I think you like learning.

NELS

Me, too.  That's why I come.

NELS

Bet there's a few things you

could teach me.  Kendo, for one.

KABUO

Sure.  I could take a fishing

gaff and split your head open.

Right above your left ear.

KABUO

You wouldn't even see it move.

NELS

You're wonderin'...how come I

never ask.  If you did it.

NELS

Now, you've told me you killed

four men.  In Germany.  So I know

you are the kind of man who can

kill.  When there's a reason.

KABUO (very quiet)

Guess I am.

NELS

You feel guilty.  That you took

their lives.  That's in your eyes.

NELS (softly)

Jury sees what I see.  More often

than not.

NELS

Prosecutor thinks.  What was

your reason?  To kill Carl Heine.

NELS

Well, there is the land itself.

Raise your children where you

were raised.  Sleep with your

wife at night, 'stead of bein'

alone on the sea.

NELS

There's fairness and honor.  You

were cheated by that old bitch.

Boy, she is something.

KABUO (simply)

She's not alone.

NELS (a murmur)

None of us are.

NELS

And prejudice, like you say.  Your

people locked in a concentration

camp.  You go off to fight for our

country's freedom.  Come back to this.

NELS

But Mr. Hooks has missed the

one

reason.  One reason.  You coulda

done it.

NELS

I read you Etta Heine's deposition.

So I could watch your mind.  Like I

do when you move your rook, or when

I move mine.

NELS

And you weren't thinking about her.

Or about land.  Or about you.

NELS

No, someone cheats you, you can

rise above that.  You're a family

man.  You put them ahead of you, hmmn?

NELS

Wasn't you she dishonored.

NELS

Your father was a strong and

tireless man.  Honest to a fault.

Kind, and humble as well...

KABUO (real quiet)

Nice.  When two fellas.  Understand

each other.

NELS

Now this jury is gonna be lookin'

at the evidence with one eye.

And at you with the oth...

KABUO

Mr. Gudmundsson, we

know

what

that jury is looking at.

NELS

Your father needs you.  To return

to your family.

NELS

So every time you think about

showing that jury strength.  Or

honor or composure.  Or dignity.

KABUO

I should show them an American?

NELS

Show them an innocent man.

KABUO

Shame you couldn't play chess with

my dad, sir.  He'd kick your ass.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I gave her all of my soul to love.

I knew someday we would live in

France.  Italy.  Somewhere.  Far

from the things that upset her.

ISHMAEL (a murmur)

You don't have to be so tragic,

you know.

HATSUE (dry)

Kind of magical, the way you know

how to comfort a girl.

HATSUE

I can just feel my spirits soar.

ISHMAEL

Well, I don't do it for just

anybody.

ISHMAEL

There can't be any wrong in

this, Ha...

HATSUE

I lie to my parents every day.

And every night.

ISHMAEL

Well.  Since I never told your

folks, I guess I'm lying to 'em,

too.  But you don't hear me

complaining about it.

HATSUE

I'm in awe.  Of your strength.

DRIVER

...not

just

Pearl, they're attackin'

all

over the Pacific, the whole

fleet

's destroyed.  The FBI's in

Seattle right now...

DRIVER

...arresting Jap traitors, the

spies and everything.  There'll

be a blackout tonight, so keep your

radios off.  So the Japs don't pick

up no signals.  You get the message?

ISHMAEL (O.S.)

Hey, Mr. Lamberson, over here!

ISHMAEL

I have a radio, too.  Don't you

want to be sure

I

got the message?

ISHMAEL

Just checking.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

It was a special edition, an extra.

My father wrote, 'These people are

our neighbors, they have sent their

sons to the United States Army...'

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

'They are no more an enemy than

our fellow islanders of German or

Italian descent.'

ISHMAEL (sleepy and loud)

LET US SO LIVE THAT, WHEN IT IS OVER,

WE CAN LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE EYE.

AND KNOW WE HAVE ACTED HONORABLY.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I guess courage never inspires the

young.  Until the danger of it bites

their butt.

HATSUE

My father can't get our money from

the bank.  We have a few dol...

ISHMAEL

It'll be over soon.  I can get

you money.

HATSUE

It's not going to get better, okay?

HATSUE

They arrested Mr. Shirazaki,

because his farm is near a navy

transmitter.  And his family can't

leave their house.

ISHMAEL

It's just Pearl Harbor.  People

are a little crazy, right n...

HATSUE

Look at my face.  It's the face of

the people who did that.  My father

hardly speaks English.  We're in

bad trouble, you have to see that.

ISHMAEL

Maybe we can fix your eyes.

ISHMAEL

Don't let this hurt us, okay?

Whatever happens.

HATSUE

It won't.  You'll see.

HISAO (O.S. shaky)

We are loyal.

FUJIKO

Everyone on the island has

these things.

AGENT (overly casual)

Well, they'll hold this stuff for

a little bit, then ship it back to

you.  It's nothing to worry about.

AGENT

You folks have been real polite,

and we'll be outta your hair in

just a second...

AGENT

That's very nice.  From the old

country, it appears.  Very high class.

AGENT

These are real nice things.

They'll take special care of 'em.

HISAO

The flute is precious.  The kimono,

the music.  Must you take th...

AGENT

...oh yeh, any old country stuff,

we have to take.

FUJIKO

This is only my daughter's

scrapbook.  For her memories.

AGENT (calling out)

Wilson?  Don't go pawing through

the underwear!

AGENT

Strawberry Princess, huh?  You

musta been flattered by that.

Looks just like y...

AGENT #2 (quiet triumph)

Dynamite.  Twenty-four sticks.

HISAO

You must believe.  This for tree

stumps.  For clearing land.

AGENT

Maybe.  Maybe.  But this is still

bad, y'see.

AGENT

It's illegal contraband, you were

s'posed to turn this stuff in.

We, uh...

AGENT

We gotta arrest you.  Have to

take you to Seattle.

AGENT

Naw, you don't need those.  Mister

Eee-ma-da-san here is a class act,

a real gentleman.

FUJIKO

Please, reconsider.  He has done

no bad th...

AGENT

Well, nobody knows that yet, do

they?  So, best for an honest man

to clear his name for godd and all.

AGENT

Only a few questions in Seattle,

okay?  Few questions, few answers,

the whole thing is over.

AGENT

Simple as that.

FUJIKO (O.S.)

Why do I read you this distres-

sing letter?  From your father.

From this hakujin...work camp, it

is called.  In Montana.

FUJIKO

Because you need to know the

darkness.  In the hearts of the

hakuj...

HATSUE (blurts)

Not all of them.

FUJIKO

The whites are enslaved by their egos,

Hatsue.  Each believes his aloneness

is everything.  We seek union wi...

HATSUE

...the ones seeking union with the

Greater Life bombed Pearl Harbor.

They are

not

humble.  I am

not

part

of them, I'm part of

here

.

FUJIKO (quietly, slowly)

I see this.  This lack of purity

is a mist around your soul.  I see

it every day, it haunts your face

in unguarded moments.

FUJIKO

I see it in your eagerness to

leave here.  And walk the woods.

In the afternoon.

FUJIKO

If you lose your true self, Hatsue.

True self...

FUJIKO

There is no way back.

ISHMAEL

See, you bring it on yourself.

23 ladies honored by the PTA, you

single out three names.  And they're

all Japanese.  That isn't journalism.

ARTHUR (quietly)

Because...?

ISHMAEL

Because journalism.  Is just the

facts.

ARTHUR

Which facts?  You can't print

them all.  Journalism is balance.

Finding the facts folks need to know.

ISHMAEL

Hence.  The letters.

ARTHUR

'Seems like you're favoring the Japs,

Art.  Writin' all about their

patriotism and loyalty with nothin'

'bout the treachery.'

ARTHUR

'Your newspaper is an insult to

all white Americans.  Please cancel

my subscription and send refund.'

ARTHUR

The calls are better. 'Jap lovers

get their balls cut off and stuffed

down their...'

(shrugs)

Missed the rest.  Hanging up will

do that.

ARTHUR

We lost the Price-Rite ads.  And

Lottie Opsvig's shop, and Larsen's

Lumberyard and the Anacortes Cafe.

And 30 percent of our subscribers.

ISHMAEL

Integrity is expensive stuff, huh?

ARTHUR

Valuable things.  Sometimes are.

ARTHUR

But.  I've got the answer.

ARTHUR

Print four pages.  Instead

of eight.

HATSUE

You're like me.  You've learned

to be devious.

ISHMAEL

It's not devious, it's what we have

to do.  You're leaving tomorrow...

ISHMAEL

You write to my house, and put

Kenny Yamashita's name on the

return address.  It's no big deal.

ISHMAEL

You smell like cedar.

HATSUE

So do you.  It's your smell I'll

miss as much as anything.

ISHMAEL

Let's get married, okay?

ISHMAEL

I want to marry you.  Is that okay?

ISHMAEL (a whisper)

Just say yes.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

When something that means your

whole life.  Is the last time ever...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

God should tell you.  Or it's not

fair.

ISHMAEL (whispers)

Please

say yes...

HATSUE (softly)

No.

HATSUE

No.  No.  It isn't right.

ISHMAEL

It felt right to me.  It felt

like getting married.

HATSUE

I'll write you.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

On Monday, March 30, 1942, the

United States Army graciously

transported the Imada women to

the docks.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Lifelong neighbors came to watch.

Curiosity masked as kindness...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

...with some exceptions.

HATSUE

You think we're far enough

away now?

HATSUE

Mom, whatever this is, they don't

keep

war

secrets this carefully.

FUJIKO

Secrets are hard to keep.

FUJIKO

This letter.  Was opened.

By mistake.

FUJIKO (reads)

'My love.  I still go to our

cedar tree in the afternoons every

day.  I shut my eyes, waiting.'

FUJIKO (reads)

'I smell your smell.  And I dream

of you.  And I ache for you to come

home.  So I can hold you and feel

you near.'

FUJIKO (reads)

'After all these years that we've

been together, I find you're a

part of me.  Without you, I have

nothing.  All my love, forever...'

FUJIKO

The neighborhood boy.  Who taught

you to swim?

HATSUE

You shouldn't have opened that.

It was mi...

FUJIKO (so quiet)

How deceitful of me.

FUJIKO

How can I ever hope.  For your

forgiveness.

FUJIKO

I have written this letter to

the boy's parents...

FUJIKO

Attraction is no crime, certainly

among children.  The dishonor

lies in the concealment.  From

your families.

FUJIKO

I know that you know this.  I know

you have suffered.  Even if the

hakujin could not.

FUJIKO

There will be no further letters.

No contact of any k...

HATSUE

One more letter.  I will write

it.  You may read it, and send

it for me.

HATSUE

I deceived more than you.  I

deceived this sweet boy.  And

myself.  It was never love.

HATSUE

I will work hard.  To earn your

forgiveness.

HATSUE

I can never hope for his.

SUMIKO

These boys are buildings us

a mansion!

KABUO

I'm Kabuo Miyamoto, Mrs. Imada.

FUJIKO

We are in your debt, Miyamoto-san.

How are your parents, your family...?

KABUO

My father is sick with the camp

food.  The rest of us are fine.

Don't speak of dept, please, we

just want to help.

KABUO

Hi, Hatsue, remember me?

KABUO

I was a senior when you were a

junior.  But I've seen you around.

HATSUE

Hello.

KABUO

Nice to see you.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Her letter reached me on the North

Island of New Zealand.  So I had a

month to think it over...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I wrote her four times.  'I hate

you with all my heart.  I hate you,

Hatsue, I'll hate you always!'

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I never sent the letters.  I wanted

to kill as many Japs as possible.

SQUAD LEADER

MOVE IT, MOVE IT, MOVE IT,

LET'S

GO

!!

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Eric Bledsoe was bleeding to death.

Thirty yards away.

BLEDSOE (crying)

Oh, shit,

please

, please help me

you guys, come on, help me, fucking

help

me, PLEASE...!

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I knew nothing could save him.  Hell,

I didn't have so much as a band-aid.

I also knew I was a coward.  For not

giving up my life to try.

SERGEANT

You

pussies

are the kinda

chickenshits

deserve to have your

balls

chewed

off real

slow

when this is over!

SERGEANT

Any man who won't follow me over

this wall is a cornhole-fucker with

a half-inch hard-on wh...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I wanted to live.  And I didn't

know why.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Some colonel came down the beach.

Any man who didn't go over the wall

at 2100 would be court-martialed,

disgraced and imprisoned...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

The captain who followed said shot

on sight.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

My arm was dealt with by a

pharmacist's mate, whose surgical

career was four hours old.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

He used a handsaw.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I dream of it, now and then.

The way my fingers curled.

Against the wall.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

...fucking goddam Jap

bitch

!

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

It was all I could think of to say.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

There was nothing more to say.

For a long while.

ZENHICHI

Your great-grandfather was a

samurai, a magnificent soldier.

ZENHICHI

He killed himself.  On the

battlefield.  At Kumamoto.

ZENHICHI

He went to battle with a sword.

Against rifles, mind you.  Knowing

what honor required.

ZENHICHI

He was angry.  To the point of

being crazy, yes.  But he knew

what honor.  Required.

ZENHICHI

Honor can require loyalty.

Revenge.  Death.

KABUO

These are safe, father.  The

hakujin will never f...

ZENHICHI (quietly)

...it is the

only

scale...

ZENHICHI

Only scale.  In which our worth.

Is weighed.

ZENHICHI

Every life ends.  And if it ends

dishonored.  It is as if...

KABUO (in English)

...we have never lived.

MORAN

Well, this one here comes off

Miyamoto's boat.  Matches all his

others, worn equal and so on.  But

this one here...

MORAN

...comes off third cleat from the

stern, port side.  And it's brand

new.  Unlike the rest.

HOOKS

And the next one...?

MORAN

From Carl Heine's boat.  All his

were like this one, three-strand

manila, new condition, braided in

loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.

HOOKS

And the last...?

MORAN

Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard

side, second cleat from the stern.

But it doesn't match Carl's lines.

It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.

HOOKS

So if defendant had tied up

to deceased's boat.  With that

last one.  Would those cleats

have lined up?

MORAN

You bet.  And if Miyamoto there

had been in a hurry to cast off,

he coulda left this line behind

on Carl's boat.

HOOKS

And replaced it later with the

new one.  That's your inference?

MORAN

Pretty darn clear.

HOOKS

And when you visited defendant on

his boat.  The evening after Carl

Heine's death.  Did it seem pretty

darn clear to him?

MORAN

Cut your engine, we're coming

aboard.

KABUO

What for, Sheriff?

MORAN

We have a warrant.  To search

your boat.

KABUO

Well, what are you looking f...

MORAN (calmly)

A murder weapon.  We think you

might be responsible for the death

of Carl Heine.

KABUO

Sheriff, if somebody killed Carl,

it sure as hell wasn't me.

MORAN

Then let's get this over with, so

you can get to fishin'.  Now, cut

yor engine.

MORAN

You always run with the well open?

KABUO

I was checking the cables.

MORAN

D-6s, huh?

MORAN

We'll come back, let's take a

look at the stern.

MORAN

See you replaced a mooring line,

lately.  This one's new.

KABUO

Naw, I had that around for a while.

MORAN

Sure you did.  Help me with this

hold cover, willya?

KABUO

There's nothin' to see.  I need to

get out there fi...

ABEL (O.S.)

Art.  Looka this.

ABEL

There's blood on it.

KABUO

Fish blood, I gaff fish with that.

MORAN

You gaff with the

hook

end.

Blood's on the butt.  Where

your hand goes.

KABUO

Sure.  Blood gets all

over

your

hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.

MORAN

Gonna have this tested.  Now you

go home, okay?  Wait til you hear

from me.

KABUO

Sheriff, I can't afford not to

fish toni...

MORAN

Look, no way I'm lettin' you out

there.  In a half hour you could

be in Canada.

MORAN

I'm sorry, son.  But you're under

arrest.

NELS (O.S.)

Now your testimony was interrupted

yesterday, when that power line

set fire to your mother-in-law's

farmhouse...

really

irritated.

NELS (O.S.)

How

is

your mother-in-law?

MORAN

She's alright, Nels, thanks

for asking.

NELS (O.S.)

And her farmhouse...?

MORAN

The damage was considerable.

But she's insured.  Thanks, again.

NELS

Well, just to put it back in

our minds, could you repeat what

you told us.  About the

type

of

batteries you found.  One Carl's boat.

MORAN

One D-6 and one D-8 in the well.

And a dead D-8 on the deck.

NELS

Which you inferred was replaced by

the D-6, which must have been a spare.

MORAN

What else could it be?

NELS

Even though a D-6 is too big, and

the flange had to be banged out to

squeeze it in.

(beat)

Which makes it a peculiar choice.

For a spare.

MORAN

You

said that.  That was

your

testimony.

NELS (chuckling)

I guess I'm a pretty smart feller,

after all.  And what were the type

batteries you found on

defendant's

boat?

MORAN (bland)

D-6s.  Like I sa...

NELS

No further questions.

NELS (O.S.)

So the blood on the gaff was not

fish blood at all.  It was

human

,

yes?  Type B positive.

DR. WHITMAN

Carl Heine's type.

NELS

But you can't say with any certainty

that the blood was his.

DR. WHITMAN

No, but as I say, the type is rare.

Ten percent of Caucasian males.

NELS

And the blood could

not

have

belonged to defendant.  Seeing

that his type is O negative.

DR. WHITMAN

That's obvious.

NELS

You scraped the dried blood from

the

butt

of the gaff.  Where a fella's

hand

goes.  And what did you see under

your microscope, besides the B positive

blood and the wood scrapings...?

DR. WHITMAN

Bits of blood and wood.  What else

would there be?

NELS

No bits of bone, no particles of

scalp, no strands of hair?

DR. WHITMAN

None.

NELS

Well, if the blood got

onto

the

gaff by crushing a man's skull...

DR. WHITMAN

I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was

asked only t...

NELS (gently persistent)

...would that seem

logical

?

DR. WHITMAN

I don't know.

NELS

You don't.

NELS

The coroner testified that Carl

Heine had a cut.  A fresh cut.

Probably one or two hours old.

NELS

On the palm.  Of his right hand.

NELS

With no bone or scalp or hair

present.  Would it be more probable

that the blood came from crushing

a man's skull...

DR. WHITMAN

I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.

NELS

...or from the cut on his hand.

Which is more probable?

DR. WHITMAN

It is not my function.  To weigh

those probabilities.

NELS

You're right.

NELS

...that's the jury's job.

HOOKS

Now this regiment you were training,

the 442nd, this was all Nisei boys...

MAPLES

They were Japanese-American boys,

yes sir.

HOOKS

And you were generally experienced

in training men for hand-to-hand

combat.

MAPLES

It was my specialty, sir, I trained

several thousand over the years.

HOOKS

So.  Wide cross-section of men to

evaluate.  And the day that the

defendant volunteered for this...

demonstration.  Did you find him

eager?

MAPLES

More than eager.  He was out to

make a point.

HOOKS

And what point.  Was that.

MAPLES

Anyone.

KABUO

SIR!

MAPLES

You don't salute me, you don't

call me 'sir', soldier, I'm an

enlisted man.

MAPLES

And nobody

bows

in this man's

Army, you're in America, son.

Not Japan.

KABUO

I'm sorry, sir, force of habit.

MAPLES

No more 'sir'.  That's the last

of that.

MAPLES

The exercise is avoiding thrusts.

Now, first y...

KABUO (quietly)

Ready, sergeant.

KABUO (quietly)

Excuse me.

MAPLES

Are you ready for some simulated

combat, soldier?

KABUO

For combat.  Sergeant.

KABUO (just above a whisper)

Your weapon, sergeant.

HOOKS

Well, what then, sergeant?

MAPLES

What else?  I had the boy teach

me kendo.  Including...the importance

of the bow.

HOOKS

And your evaluation of the

defendant?  Could he kill a much

larger man with a fishing gaff?

So quickly, there would be no

sign of struggle?

MAPLES

Oh, in a heartbeat.

MAPLES

Able and willing.  Like few men

I've ever seen.

HOOKS

So the plan was for your husband

to fish through the prime season.

Then, in November, sell the boat.

And you would move onto the farm.

SUSAN MARIE

That was his plan, yes.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Whatever she said, she was Hooks'

star witness.  The jury, especially

the men, would not betray this fine

lady with a not guilty verdict.  How

could they face her?

HOOKS

Can you think back for me to the

morning of September 8?  The day

after your husband purchased the

farm.  One

week

before his death.

Can you recall that morning?

SUSAN MARIE

I can.

CARL (O.S.)

What

could

I tell him?  There's

my mother to think about.  You

know what

she'd

say?

CARL (O.S.)

I said I'd think it over, talk

with you.

SUSAN MARIE

Did he go away angry?

CARL

He kept talkin' about those seven

acres

belonged

to his father, and

how

honorable

and

decent

his father

was.  His meaning was pretty clear.

And I didn't much like it.

SUSAN MARIE

You had a scrap.

CARL

I couldn't...

talk

to him.  Look,

Kabuo's a Jap.  And I don't hate

Japs, but I don't like 'em neither.

It's hard to explain if you weren't

in the war, you know?

SUSAN MARIE

He's not a Jap.  You don't mean

that.  You and he were friends.

CARL

We were kids.

NELS (O.S.)

So your husband said he's think

it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto

to believe he might sell to h...

SUSAN MARIE

I wouldn't say encouraged.

NELS (O.S.)

Well, he didn't say 'no', did he?

Didn't say no hope existed.

SUSAN MARIE

Not in those words.

NELS (O.S.)

So the defendant was encouraged

to hope.  Or could have been.

SUSAN MARIE

I guess so.

NELS

I guess you'd have to guess.

Not having been there with them.

Having to guess whether your husband's

report was word for word accurate.

SUSAN MARIE

Carl never lied.

NELS

Of course not.  But it was

emotional.  A friend's plea set

against his mother's attitude.

NELS

Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant

ever aim one of those at you?

SUSAN MARIE

He had no reason to.

NELS

Carl ever say

he

got one?

SUSAN MARIE

I can't speak for him.

NELS

You can speak for what he

said

.

Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...

HOOKS (O.S.)

Objection, badgering the wi...

NELS

Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine.

Shall I repeat the ques...

SUSAN MARIE

Carl said he didn't like Kabuo

much anymore.

NELS

The question is more about the

defendant's

attitu...

SUSAN MARIE

That's all he said.

SUSAN MARIE

And we can't ask him anymore.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

My father had bought the DeSoto

fifteen years before.  Driving it

reminded me of him.  Which I

considered a neutral fact...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Actually, it was pleasant.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Snow made all the fields into one.

The notion that one man might kill

another for a small patch, made no

sense.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

But I knew such things occurred.

Having been to war and all.

ISHMAEL

May I give you folks a lift?

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I didn't look at her.  I thought

that would be best.

HATSUE

My father is grateful for your

kindness.  But he will free his

car, shortly.

ISHMAEL

Okay, I'll help.

ISHMAEL

I know it's caused you trouble.

But don't you think the snow is

beautiful, coming down?

HISAO

Yes,

very

beautiful.

HATSUE

This trial is unfair.  You should

write about that in your newspaper.

ISHMAEL (calmly)

What should I say?

HATSUE

Just that.  This trial is

wrong

,

they are calling a good man a killer.

It is only about prejudice, and that

is unfair.

ISHMAEL

We all expect the world to be fair.

As if we have some right t...

HATSUE

I don't mean everyone.  Just people

who can do things because they can

arrest people or convict them.  Or

run a newspaper.

ISHMAEL

Maybe I

should

write a column.

What do you think?

HATSUE

What do

you

think?

ISHMAEL

I think people.  Should be fair.

HATSUE

Will you write that?

ISHMAEL

I might just.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I was part of her life again.  I

was a person.

ISHMAEL

You have the night watch?  On the

radio.

LEVANT

Since September.  Last guys got

transferred.

lot

of stuff.

ISHMAEL

And you keep the records, or

contribute to 'em.

LEVANT

Shorthard the radio transmis-

sions, write 'em up, file 'em

in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks.

Just take up space.

ISHMAEL

All kinds of radio transmissions?

Fisherman in trouble, and such.

LEVANT

All kinds.  Make yourself at home.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I'd been back two months.  It was

the first time I'd seen her.

HATSUE

Hello.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I couldn't say anything.  I just

stood there, hating her.

HATSUE

I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and

I.  Are very sor...

ISHMAEL

The Japs did it.

ISHMAEL

They shot it off.  At Tarawa.

ISHMAEL

I'm sorry, I'm sorry I said that.

ISHMAEL

I'm sorry about everything.  All

of it.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

September 16.  At 1:42 A.M., the

dead of night.  The S.S. West Corona,

a Greek-owned freighter, was lost.

In heavy fog.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

They radioed to the lighthouse.

They would have to dogleg, bisecting

Ship Channel Bank.  And Seaman Philip

Milholland wrote that down.  In his

report.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Carl Heine drowned.  In Ship

Channel Bank.  And his watch

stopped.  At 1:47.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

A huge freighter plowing through.

Throwing a wake big enough to fling

any man overboard.

ISHMAEL (calls out)

Seaman...?

ISHMAEL

How long you have this detail?

LEVANT

Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch

September 16.

ISHMAEL

You mean, early morning the 16th?

LEVANT

No, night of the 16th, morning the

17th.  We replaced two guys named

Miller and Milholland.

LEVANT

They got transferred that day.

Out to Cape Flattery.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Some seaman's loast report.

Stuffed in a cabinet, good as

lost forever.  No one knows.

LEVANT

You get what you come for?

ISHMAEL

Guess I'm not completely sure.

What that was.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I left the grocery, and wrote a

letter.  I apologizes from my heart.

I should never have said that word

to her.  I never would again.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

It sat in my desk for two weeks.

Before I threw it away.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I knew her car.  And sometimes

when I'd see it, I'd...drive that

way.  At a distance.

ISHMAEL

Can I talk to you?

HATSUE

I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't

right for us to be alone.  People

will t...

ISHMAEL

There's no one here, and I've

got

to talk to you.

ISHMAEL

Don't you owe me that?

ISHMAEL

I'm like a dying person.

ISHMAEL

I don't sleep.  I tell myself this

can't go on, but it goes on anyway.

HATSUE

I did a terrible thing, Ishmael.

I knew what you felt.  And what I

didn't.

HATSUE

And I never found the courage to

tell you.

ISHMAEL

You'll think this is crazy, but all

I want is to hold you.  Just once.

And smell your hair.

HATSUE

You have to hear this, I can

never touch you, Ishmael.  Not

once, not ever.  There's no half-

way.  As much as I know it hurts

you, you have to let this go.

ISHMAEL

Look, I

want

to forget you, I do.

I think if you hold me, just this

once, I can walk away and never

speak to you again.

ISHMAEL

Please?  As one human being to

another, just because I'm miserable

and don't know where to turn.  I

need to be in your arms.  If it's

just for thirty seconds.

HATSUE

I hurt for you.  Whether you'll

ever believe that or not.

HATSUE

I feel sick sometimes, with the

guilt of what I've done to you.

And I can't make it right.

HATSUE

To hold you would be wrong and

deceitful.  You're going to have

to live without holding me, that

is the truth of the way things are.

HATSUE

Things end.  They do.  Get on

with your life.

HATSUE

Get on with your life.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I drove from the lighthouse to

my mother's place.  I brought

her some groceries.

HELEN

Your father thought that heavy snow

was God's kindness.  Despite the

hardship, it brought us beauty...

HELEN

...and reminded us.  Of our place

in things.

HELEN

You don't believe in God anymore.

ISHMAEL

Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve,

Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.

HELEN

We don't

know

God, we

feel

Him.  You

felt Him as a child.  I remember.

ISHMAEL

That's a long time ago.  What a

child feels...that's different.

HELEN

Spend the night, will you?  Don't

go back out into all that snow.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I felt Milholland's report in my

pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't

telling her.  Telling someone.

What I'd found.

HELEN

You've been busy with that trial,

I suppose.  Such a travesty...

HELEN

They only arrested that poor soul

because he's Japanese.

ISHMAEL

Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They

say the evidence is rock solid.

HELEN

They're not his neighbor, like

you are.  He is a husband, a father,

he risked his

life

for

their

country.

The same as you.

ISHMAEL

Those aren't the facts that matter.

HELEN

Well, folks are pretty cold.

And folks who believe in nothing

else...they're cold, too.

HELEN

I've tried to understand your

unhappiness, all these years.

Having gone to war, losing your arm...

HELEN

But other boys came back.  And

pushed on.  They found girls, and

married, had babies...

ISHMAEL

Someday I'll get lucky, too.

HELEN

Your father fought at Belleau

Wood, it took him years to get

over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...

ISHMAEL

...but he found you.

HELEN

It isn't the war, Ishmael.  All

those years growing up.  You never

had a real girl of your own.

HELEN

And I know you have it in you

to love.  I know that much.  I

wish I knew more.

ISHMAEL

I'll stay tonight.  Thanks

for asking.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I came back from the war to

this room.  I stayed a few

months.  Until my father passed.

NAGAISHI

The Japanese people of the island

are saddened by this loss.  Your

father was a man of great fairness

and compassion for others...

NAGAISHI

A friend to us.  And to all people.

ISHMAEL

Well...

NAGAISHI

We know you will follow in his

footsteps.  And honor his legacy.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

I thought it then.  And often since.

A balance, he's said.  Finding the

facts.  That folks needed to know.

HATSUE (V.O.)

Dear Ishmael.  These things are

very difficult to say.  I can't

think of anything more painful

than writing this letter.

ISHMAEL (a murmur)

Think of reading it.

HATSUE (V.O.)

I don't love you, Ishmael.  There

is no more honest way to say it.

HATSUE (V.O.)

Whenever we were together, I knew

it.  I loved you and I didn't love

you at the same moment.

HATSUE (V.O.)

The last time.  At the cedar tree.

I knew we could never be right

together.  And that soon I would

have to tell you.

HATSUE (V.O.)

This is the last time I will write

to you.  I am not yours anymore.

HATSUE (V.O.)

I wish you the very best.  Your

heart is large and you are gentle

and kind.  I know you will do great

things in the world.

HATSUE (V.O.)

I must say good-bye to you now.

Our lives will move on.  The best

we can.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Milholland's report was like her

letter.  Something no one else.

Would ever read.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Thing about having only one hand.

It's hard to tear pages up.  And

I wasn't carrying a match.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

So I thought of my father.  The man

who would have taken this report to

Judge Fielding.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

But every reporter.  Chooses his own

balance.  FInds the facts that matter.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

After all, the freighter was only

a theory.  It proved nothing at

all.  There were other facts.

That mattered.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Tomorrow I would write a column.

About prejudice.  And she would

be grateful.  For my large...and

gentle...heart.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Her husband would be judged.  And

she would be alone.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Alone.  The past looks different.

HATSUE

Hopeful.  Is the word I would use.

NELS

But Carl didn't say yes.

HATSUE

He didn't say no.  That was Kabuo's

point.  Given how Carl's mother

felt, Carl was

still

willing to

consider selling to us.  It was a

good sign.

NELS

Well, in the week that followed,

the week before Carl's death...

did your husband pursue him?

HATSUE

No.  Kabuo did not wish to beg,

he respected Carl's right to

reflect.  He was sure Carl would

do the honorable thing.

NELS (right back)

And did he?

HATSUE

The night of the 15th, Kabuo helped

Carl at sea.  With his dead battery.

HATSUE

Right there, on the boat, they

agreed.  $8400 for the seven acres,

$800 down.  They shook on it.  Kabuo

was so excited when he came home.

NELS

And when did you first learn.

That Carl had drowned?

HATSUE

One o'clock, that afternoon, from

a clerk at Petersen's.

NELS (turning to Hooks)

Your witness.

HOOKS

Your husband came home agitated,

after his encounter with the

deceased?

HATSUE

I said 'excited'.  Not agitated,

he was excited in the sense of

being overjoyed.

HOOKS

You were...overjoyed yourself, to

hear the news?

HATSUE

Happy for him.  And relieved.

HOOKS

So, then, you...and your husband...

must have called friends, relatives,

to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?

HATSUE (calm, respectful)

No.

HOOKS

Really?  Didn't call your mother,

your sisters, about starting a new

life.  Your husband never tells

his brothers that the family honor

is vindicated.

HATSUE

We hear how Carl...passed away.

Only a few hours later.

HOOKS

Your husband returned at, what,

seven o'clock?

HATSUE

Closer to eight.

HOOKS

So, five hours.  Plenty of time for

a call.  He was 'excited', you say.

In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.

HATSUE

We are...cautious people.  You

would say conservative.  There

would be time for celebrating

with others when a paper was signed.

HOOKS

You thought the deceased might...

break his promise?

HATSUE

Of course not.  We're just not

quick to run and boast.  In case

something went wrong.

HOOKS

And then, something did.  Carl

Heine was found dead.  With his

head crushed.

HATSUE

Yes, and then, what was there

to call about?  Everything was

up in the air.

HOOKS

Up in the air?  Was

that

your

reaction?

HOOKS

I would suggest that more happened

than a land sale evaporating.  A

man

died

, Mrs. Miyamoto.  A husband

and father of small

children

had

his

skull

bashed in!

HATSUE (quiet dignity)

If you mean to imply that we were

callous about Carl's death, that is

wrong and insulting.

HOOKS

I see.  Well, did you come

forward to tell Sheriff Moran

what you knew?  The encounter in

the fog, the...dead battery, was it?

HATSUE

We discussed that.  And decided

not to.

HOOKS

Why not?

HATSUE

Because the facts could be

misconstrued as murder.

HOOKS

But if truth was on your side,

whatever were you worried about?

HATSUE

Trials aren't only about truth,

Mr. Hooks.  Even though they

should be.  They're about what

people

believe

is true.

HOOKS

So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.

HATSUE

We were afraid.  Silence seemed

better.  To come forward seemed

like a mistake.

HOOKS

Well, it seems to me...

NELS (gently)

Objection.  Mr. Hooks can give

his view in his summation.

HOOKS

Doesn't it seem to

you

, Mrs.

Miyamoto, that your mistake was

in being deceitful?  Concealing

information during the course of

a sheriff's investigation.

HATSUE

It seems human.  To me.

HOOKS

I suppose that you mean this

excuses

concealing the truth.  Then why

ahouls any of us believe you now?

HOOKS

Question withdrawn, you may

step down.

HATSUE

You're implying th...

HOOKS

I said.  No further questions.

JUDGE

That's enough, Mrs. Miyamoto, not

another word.  Step down, please.

NELS (O.S.)

Thirty years fishing alone.  Ever

had an occasion to board another

man's boat

except

in an emergency?

Maybe to socialize or some such?

GILLANDERS (ready for this)

Never.  Only boarded some fella's boat

five, six times in thirty-

one

years.

Dead engine, broken hip, only in need.

NELS (O.S.)

Now, Mister Gi...

GILLANDERS

Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't

bother each other, stick to ourselves.

Ask anybody.

NELS

Now if you wanted to kill a man.

Think you'd try boarding against

his will, and hitting him with a

fishing gaff?

GILLANDERS

It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's

boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come

aboard?  All against Carl's will?

It's the stupidest suggestion I

ever heard of.

NELS

I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't

mine in the first place.

NELS

So the fishing gaff method wouldn't

make sense?

GILLANDERS

Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd

just

shoot

the feller.

Then

tie

up, throw him inta th' drink.  And

skip bein' the first gill-netter

in history to make a successful

forced boarding.

NELS

Now the sheriff believed that the

D-6 battery in Carl's well was

Carl's own spare.  Even though it

was too large f...

GILLANDERS

No sense to have

any

at all.,

even the right size.  It's like

having an extra battery in the

trunk of your car.  Nobody does.

GILLANDERS

Boat has two batteries.  Lose one

you run off the other til morning.

Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto

there gave him one a his.

NELS

Course, if Carl lost both batteries,

dead in the water, his radio wouldn't

work.  So how would he signal for help?

GILLANDERS

Compressed air horn, most likely.

Hope to God some man hears you in

that fog.

NELS

All right, what if the defendant

heard

?  So Carl

let

him aboard, to

help.  And

then

the fishing gaff?

GILLANDERS

You mean Miyamoto followed him out

there, and sucker-punched him?

NELS

Well, what if?

GILLANDERS

Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know

in

advance

?  That Carl loses two

batteries.  Must happen once ever'

20 years or so.

NELS

Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank

you for coming down, in this cold

weather.

GILLANDERS

Well, it does seem mighty warm in

here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.

HOOKS

What if the defendant follows Carl.

And pretends his

own

batteries are

dead?  Would Carl tie up and help?

HOOKS

Is the word you're groping

for...'yes', perha...

JUDGE (O.S.)

Alvin!

HOOKS

Rephrase.  Do you agree that he

might tie up to the defendant's bo...

GILLANDERS

So why's the D-6 in Carl's well?

HOOKS

Who's to say?  Maybe it was just

a spare, after all.  Or maybe the

defendant

left it, as a potential

alibi.  In case somebody saw him

in Ship Channel Bank.

(beat)

In case we put two and two

together, knowing of the hostility.

Between the families.

HOOKS

My question is.  Could Carl have

tied up to help the defendant?

GILLANDERS

It

coulda

happened.  And if I start

to say it's doubtful, you'd probl'y

say 'no further questions', right?

HOOKS

Right about that.

And

right that

it 'coulda happened'.

HOOKS

Thanks for your help.  Hope the

witness box wasn't too warm for

your comfort.

NELS

But the toughest scenario.  Is the

one Hooks will never raise.

KABUO

And what's that?

NELS

That you came upon Carl by accident.

Like you said.  Gave him the battery.

Like you said.  Asked him about the

seven acres.  Like you said.

NELS

Only.  He said no.

NELS

And something...happened.  That

you'd never planned.  Because

you're not a cold-blooded killer.

KABUO

I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh?

Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.

NELS

You won't hear that from Hooks.

Because the charge is

first

-degree

murder, which requires premeditation.

He can't change the charge.

NELS

So if the jury thinks you

did

kill.

but only in the heat of anger.  They

have to acquit.

NELS

And you couldn't.  Be.  Re-tried.

KABUO

You want me to say that.

NELS

I want you.  To tell the truth.

KABUO

You think that

is

the truth.

NELS

I told your wife.  Trials aren't

always so much about actual truth.

As about what folks

believe

is true.

That's sad.  And it's real.

KABUO

And what do you believe?

NELS

A question first.  Why do you want

to know?

KABUO (straight back)

Because you're my friend.

NELS

I believe you are a good man.  Who

belongs with his family.

NELS

And I believe.  You didn't do it.

CARL (O.S.)

My batteries are drawed down, both

of 'em.  ALternator belts were loose.

KABUO (O.S.)

No sweat.  We'll pull one a mine,

get ya started.

KABUO (O.S.)

You lashed up a lantern?  'Gainst

a fog like this?

CARL (O.S.)

Lantern and a air horn.  That's

all I got, without my juice.

CARL

Don't know how long it's take to

get a charge...

KABUO

Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish.

I'll see ya back on the docks...

CARL (quietly)

Hold on.  You know as well as

I do, we got somethin' to talk

about.

CARL

Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what

you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious,

is all.

KABUO

What are you sellin' 'em for?

Why don't we start there.

CARL

Did I say I was selling?  But

if I was, I'd have to figure you

want 'em real bad.  Oughta charge

a sall fortune, maybe...

CARL

Then again.  Maybe you'd want

your battery back.

KABUO

The battery's in, that's done

with.  Besides, you'd do the

same for m...

CARL

...

might

do the same.  I have to

warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm

not screwed together like I used

to be.

CARL

Hell, I'm sorry, okay?  About

the whole damn mess.  If I'd a

been around, my mother wouldn't

a pulled it off that way.

CARL (grins)

I was out there at sea.  Fightin'

you Jap sons-a-bitches.

KABUO (no grin)

I'm an American.  Did I call you

a Nazi, you big Nazi bastard?

CARL (softly)

Not that I recall.

KABUO

I killed men who looked just like

you, pig-fed German bastards.  And

their blood don't wash off so easy.

KABUO

So don't talk to me about Japs,

you big Nazi son of a bitch.

CARL

I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun

Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still

got your bamboo fishing rod.

KABUO

Oh, yeh?

CARL

Hid it from my mom.  Caught a mess

a sea runs.  Damn thing's still in

my closet.

KABUO (very softly)

You can have it.  The hell with it.

CARL

$1200 an acre, that's what I paid

Ole, won't take a dime less.  You

got no choice on that.

KABUO

Didn't say I was buyin' did I?

What you want down?  Just bein'

curious, is all.

CARL

A thousand down.  We'll sign

papers t'morrow.

KABUO

Eight hundred.  And it's a deal.

HOOKS (O.S.)

For the life of me, sir, I cannot

imagine

why you kept this story from

the sheriff.

KABUO

As my wife testified, we were

considering it.

HOOKS

Actually, she said you had decided.

Decided

not

not come forward.

KABUO (quietly)

I was thinking about it.  Every

minute.

HOOKS

Except even when Sheriff Moran

arrested

you.  You said

nothing

about seeing Carl.

HOOKS

At that point, you were

already

under suspicion.  The battery story

explained

things.  If the story was

true...and not simply something you

thought up later...

HOOKS

Why.  Didn't you.  Tell it?

KABUO

Sheriff said right off, I was

under suspicion.  I didn't have

a lawyer...

HOOKS

But even

after

you had an

attorney.  You still claimed to

know

nothing

.  Claimed

not

to

have seen Carl. Am I correct?

KABUO

Yes.  Initially.

HOOKS

Well, 'initially' is an interesting

word, sir.  You'd

been

arrested,

you

had

a lawyer, and you

still

claimed ignorance!

KABUO

I should have told everything

right away.  I know that now,

and I regret it.

HOOKS

Should have told 'everything'.

Meaning, you should have told

the

truth

.

HOOKS

Nothing to say?

KABUO (quietly)

I didn't know that was a question.

It sounded like a speech.

HOOKS

My apologies.  Do you regret

not telling the truth?

KABUO

I have told the truth.

HOOKS

You mean, this morning.  The

new story, the battery story.

That one is the truth?  That's

a question, sir.

KABUO (even quieter)

Yes.  And I told it long before

this morning.

HOOKS

I see.  Now what happened the

day Carl Heine was found?  Before

your arrest.

KABUO

I slept til one-thirty, when my

wife woke me up with the news.  We

talked for a few hours.  I left at

six and went straight to my boat.

HOOKS

Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands,

no purchases?  Just straight to the

boat.  That's the truth.

KABUO

Yes.

HOOKS

Well, the sheriff found

two

batteries

in your well.  If you left one with

Carl Heine, how is that possible?

KABUO

I had a spare battery in my shed.

I brought it down, and put it in

just before the sheriff showed up.

HOOKS

Conveniently, in your shed.  Only

you didn't mention that a moment ago.

Why does this battery story change

every time a new question is raised?

KABUO

You asked if I went straight to the

boat.  I did.  With the battery.

HOOKS

You're a hard man to trust, sir.

You sit before us, with no expression,

keeping a poker f...

NELS (O.S.)

Objection!

JUDGE

You know better than that, Mr.

Hooks.  Either ask questions

that count for something, or sit

down and be done with it.

JUDGE

Shame on you.

HOOKS

I apologize to the court, for

letting my feelings get the

better of me.

HOOKS

No other questions.  We'll go to

summation.

HOOKS

...believing that Etta Heine's son

would

never

sell him the land.  Land

that in

his

mind, filtered through

ancient rules of behavior handed down

from his ancestors' culture,

belonged

to his family by right...

HOOKS

His

only

choice to get the land

would be to

eliminate

Carl Heine.

So that Ole Jurgensen would need

a new buyer.

HOOKS

In his mind.  Seen through codes

of revenge difficult for us to

fathom, this was also the

only

way

to

avenge

what he felt to be the

grievous

dishonor

brought to his

father, his family...

HOOKS

...to a thousand years of ancestry,

in a foreign land we

still

find an

enigma.  Despite our recent bitter

experience with its ways.

HOOKS

Thus believing cold-blooded murder to

be

justified

...he trailed Carl Heine...

could hear his engine in the fog...and

sounded his own horn, claiming distress.

HOOKS

As Carl pulled alongside: 'Please,

Carl,' the defendant must have said.

'I am sorry for what has come between

us, but adrift here in the fog, I

plead

for your help!'

HOOKS

And so this good man tied his

boat fast, while his enemy

leaps

aboard,

striking

the treacherous

blow he was trained to strike by

his father's hand.

HOOKS

The feud over these seven acres

had festered for eight

years

.  He

argued

with Carl about buying the

land

one week

before Carl was killed.

Carl's

skull

was crushed, and his

blood

is on a

murder

weapon with which

the defendant is a deadly

expert

!

HOOKS

And after a series of

lies

.  The

defendant at last

admits

he was

there

.  Alone on the boat.  In

the fog.  Carl Heine's blood on

his fishing gaff.

HOOKS

My lord.  My lord.

HOOKS

Look clearly at the defendant.

See the truth self-evident in him.

And in the facts of this case.

HOOKS

Look into his eyes, ladies and

gentlemen, consider his face.

And ask yourself what your duty

is as citizens of this community.

NELS (O.S.)

...not a

single

witness has testified

to

anything

that could suggest pre-

meditated murder.  Not in the days

before Carl Heine's death...or at

any

time...has

anyone

described a

murderous rage toward the deceased.

NELS

Etta Heine had cheated his family.

He had asked his childhood friend

Carl to sell him the land.  And

Carl was considering it.

NELS

There is

no

evidence of anger at

Carl, much less

rage

, much less

murderous

rage.  No

reason

for

premeditation and no

evidence

of

it.  Anywhere.

NELS

And yet the state is required to

prove

these things.  Beyond.  A

reasonable.  Doubt.

NELS

Can you seriously think there is

no

reasonable doubt?  Why is

Kabuo's

D-6 battery in

Carl's

well, if Carl

was helping

him

?

NELS

Why isn't the blood on the gaff

more

consistent with Carl's

hand

wound than a

skull

fracture?  Given

the absence of bone or brain tissue.

NELS

What Mr. Hooks asks you to believe

is that

no

proof is needed.  Against

a man who bombed Pearl Harbor.

NELS

Look at his face, the prosecutor said.

Presuming that you will see an enemy

there.  Treacherous by nature, by a

thousand years of something or other.

NELS

An argument I find as despicable as

it is dishonest and twisted and

insulting

to us all.  Mr. Miyamoto

is a

much

-decorated

hero

of the United

States Army.  For God's sake.

NELS

If someone said you should convict

Carl Heine.  Or his lovely widow.

Of murder.  Without proof.  Because

their ancestry is the same as

Hitler's.  You would

spit

in his eye.

NELS

And every decent American.  Would

applaud you.

NELS

Now Kabuo Miyamoto did one thing

wrong.  He was afraid to trust us,

at first.  Afraid that he would be

crucified by prejudice.  As Mr. Hooks

is urging you to do.

NELS

Well, we sent him.  And his wife.

And thousands of Americans to

concentration camps.  They lost

homes, belongings, everything.

We

did that, folks.  Can we now be

unforgiving about his uncertainty?

His mistrust?

NELS

You may think this is a small trial.

In a small place.  Well, it isn't.

NELS

Every once in awhile.  Somewhere

in the world.  Humanity goes on

trial.  And integrity.  And decency.

Every once in awhile, common folks

get called on to give the report

card for the human race.

NELS

Now here in America.  We relish

those chances.  Give us that one,

we say.  That's why we built this

country in the first place.

NELS

Be Americans.  Make your

children proud.

MORAN

I'm awful sorry, Ma'am, but you

know I c...

HATSUE

What are you afraid of, Sheriff?

HATSUE

Am I going to slip him a weapon

for a mad escape?  Perhaps a kendo

staff hidden in my dress?

MORAN

There's rules.

HATSUE

Well, please break them, then.

I won't keep you a moment.

HATSUE

I love you.  And tomorrow, when

I make our bed.  I'm setting out

your pillow.

HATSUE (whispers)

You better be there.

KABUO

Only if you ask me nice.

HATSUE

Did you write that column?

ISHMAEL

I did.  But the jury won't s...

HATSUE

It's not for the.  They only

get to convict him.

HATSUE

It's the judge who decides.  If

he'll hang.

ISHMAEL (gently)

None of that is gonna ha...

HATSUE

You don't think he did this.

ISHMAEL

I know he didn't.

HATSUE

Come to supper, tonight.  My

mother would be proud to have

you with us.

ISHMAEL

I can't.

ISHMAEL

Tell your mom.  I want a rain check.

MORAN

You have a visitor, son.

MORAN

You said three minutes.

ISHMAEL

Won't take two.

KABUO

Please, sit down...

KABUO

She told me you're writing a

column.  We're very grateful.

KABUO

She.  Said you two go way back...

KABUO

That's nice.

ISHMAEL

You said there was a lantern

in his hand.  When you found

him in the fog.

ISHMAEL

And another one.  Lashed to

the mast?

KABUO

That's right.

ISHMAEL

Two.  Lanterns.

KABUO

If I did the math right.

ISHMAEL

It's the sheriff's math.  I'm

wondering about.

MORAN (O.S.)

Blackmail.  That's all it is.

ISHMAEL (O.S.)

I call it keeping your promise.

We said if I ever needed some

cooperation from you...

MORAN

You threatened me, Chambers, pure

and simple.  And what idiot's gonna

believe some cock and bull story

that I made a deal to keep stuff

outta your paper?  Not that anybody

reads

your paper.

ISHMAEL

Same idiots who'll believe

you

cracked this case.  When I tell

'em you did.

MORAN

See, no lantern.

ABEL (respectfully)

Sheriff?  That's Miyamoto's boat.

MORAN (quiet triumph)

No lantern there, neither.

MORAN

Never shoulda given you that

inventory in the first place.

ISHMAEL

It's public record.  If the public

cares enough to read it.

ISHMAEL

You said there was a coffee c...

ABEL (sorry)

I picked it up.

ABEL

It's the only thing I moved, I

swear.  It was right there.

MORAN

You wanna see that in the

papers

?

Don't

ever

touch something at a cri...

MORAN

One lantern.  Like the inventory

says.  Sorry to disappoint you.

ISHMAEL

Actually.  I was hoping you got

it right.  What's that, up there?

MORAN

Nothin'.  Bits of string.

ISHMAEL

Pieces of twine aren't nothing.

MORAN

Here now, what are you fixin'

to do?

ISHMAEL

Have a look.  At nothing.

MORAN

You can't go up there, touch things...

ISHMAEL (grunting)

Trial's over, Sheriff, it's with

the jury now.

MORAN

You gonna climb that with one arm?

ISHMAEL

You're right.  I better use two.

ABEL

There's lots of 'em, Art, look.

ISHMAEL

A dozen or more, all figure eights.

All cut clean through on an angle.

ABEL

And look at that streak of rust,

across the mast.

ISHMAEL

It's on the twine, too.  But it's

not r...

MORAN

Don't prove there was two lanterns.

Coulda been the one in the cabin.

ISHMAEL

There's a stretch of ground

between guessin' and provin',

Sheriff.  I'll give you that.

MORAN (O.S.)

What do you think you're lookin'

at now?

ISHMAEL (O.S.)

Not what I'm looking at.  It's

what I'm looking for.

ALEXANDER VAN NESS

Well.  I guess it comes down to

a feeling, don't it?  If I

feel

uncertain, I feel a

doubt

.  Isn't

that it?

HAROLD JENSEN

Alex, nobody ain't ever

sure

about

nothin'.  It's

un

reasonable to be so

stubborn that you think you're smarter

than

eleven

folks who all

agree

!

EDITH TWARDZIK

The man sat there and

admitted

he

lied

, Mr. Van Ness.  Now

why

isn't

that enough for you?

ALEXANDER VAN NESS

We're not tryin' him for lying.  Lots

of us told lies, one time or another.

Prob'ly none of us murdered anybody.

HAROLD JENSEN

But what

drives

a man to lie?

Means he's

hiding

somethin'.

ALEXANDER VAN NESS

Not

necessarily

that he killed

Carl.  I'm not sayin' you're wrong,

just that I have my doubts.

BURKE LATHAM

Look, if you changed chairs right

now, cos you doubted that maybe a

chunk of the moon was gonna fall

through the roof, that wouldn't be

a

reasonable

doubt.

ALEXANDER VAN NESS (laughs)

Okay, you win that one.  Now can

we all go to bed?

HARLAN McQUEEN

The mooring line.  Doesn't that

tell you something?

ALEXANDER VAN NESS

I think it does.  Miyamoto was on

Carl's boat, or vice-versa.  Not

much doubt about th...

MARLAN McQUEEN

And Carl's blood on the gaff?

ALEXANDER VAN NESS

There's a chance it came from his

hand.

BURKE LATHAM

There's a chance of everything.

But you add a chance from here and

a chance from there, the world ain't

made a coincidences only.

EDITH TWARDZIK

Look, if he gave Carl a battery

like he said, he'd only a had

one

left.  Not two.

ALEXANDER VAN NESS

He explained that.  He replaced it.

HARLAN McQUEEN

Only he threw that part in when he

got cornered.  But first time around,

he never mentioned it.

ROGER PORTER

Alex, stop arguin' just to argue.

You can see what

really

happened,

same as us.  Isn't that what we're

supposed to do is tell the actual

truth?  My God, Carl died, here.

ALEXANDER VAN NESS

So I don't care Carl died, unless

I'm ready to reach for the hangman's

rope?  You oughta stop tryin' to

bully me into hurrying.

BURKE LATHAM

Been six hours.  You sayin' there's

a way to go slower?

NELS

Well.  It's imaginative...

NELS

...I'll give you that.

ISHMAEL

It's the way it happened, I know

it is.

NELS

No, you don't.

NELS

That report.  About the freighter?

You didn't find that tonight, did you?

NELS

You went right to the cell.  Then

to the boat.  Then here.  How long

did you know about the freighter?

ISHMAEL (just above a whisper)

One day.

NELS

This tastes horrible, hmmn?

ISHMAEL

You're wondering why I held it.

NELS

I'm wondering how the judge is

gonna like my waking up his old

bones.  in the middle of the night.

NELS

Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.

ISHMAEL

Yes, he was.

NELS

He's looking down.  And he's not

thinking 'bout the man you were

yesterday.  He's proud of the man

you are tonight.  That's what counts.

ISHMAEL

To my father.  Everything counts.

NELS

What if I told you he once said

to me...don't matter the road we

take.  Just so we get there.

ISHMAEL (smiles)

Then you'd be lying.

NELS

Doesn't make me wrong.

NELS (O.S.)

All right, let's say that twine

had

been there to lash a lantern.

That it had come from the shuttle of

twine found in the deceased's pocket.

NELS (O.S.)

Now to re-open a trial that had

gone to jury...new evidence should

be pretty important.

NELS (O.S.)

Tell us why that lantern would be

so significant.

ISHMAEL

Well.  It shows the prosecutor was

wrong.  It was

Carl's

boat that was

dead in the water.  Or he'd never

have put up the lantern.

NELS

Now you believe there were

two

lanterns when defendant arrived.

One in Carl's hand.  The second

lashed to the mast.

ISHMAEL

That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported,

and he'd have no reason to lie.

He couldn't know that it would help

his case.

NELS

Well, why does it?

ISHMAEL

Because the second lantern, the one

on the mast.  Was never found.  So

we have to ask...

ISHMAEL

...where did it go?

ISHMAEL

Maybe it went.  Where Carl went.

Over the side.

HOOKS

Objection!  Speculation.

NELS

Your Honor,

all

of this is

speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks'

dramaturgy about the defendant

issuing a false distress call.

HOOKS

Tht was summation, Your H...

JUDGE (gently)

Overruled, Alvin.  Let's hear

this, hmmn?

NELS

So how does this fit with what

you told us at the start?  The

freighter that plowed through

Ship Channel Bank...

ISHMAEL

That's when he fell.

NELS

Fell.

ISHMAEL

Miyamoto gave him the battery, and

left.  Carl's boat was running, he

goes back to fishing.  But at some

point, he thinks of the lantern...

NELS

Still lashed to the mast.

ISHMAEL

He figures a perfectly good

lantern could get banged around

up there.  So he climbs up.  To

cut it down.

NELS

Just as the freighter comes through?

Isn't that quite a coincidence?

ISHMAEL

Coincidences happen.  You run a

yellow light

just

as a car comes

out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy

happens every day.  Or maybe...

NELS

Maybe...?

ISHMAEL

Maybe Carl picks up something about

the freighter on his radio, which is

now working.  Same report Milholland

heard.  And

that

makes him get the

lantern fast.  Before the freighter's

wake can bang it around.

NELS

But you

could

be wrong.  He

could

have climbed up earlier.

ISHMAEL

Then where's the lantern?  And

where's the knife?

NELS

The knife.  What knife?

ISHMAEL

Coroner found an empty knife sheath

on Carl's belt.  But they never

found the knife.

ISHMAEL

He climbs up.  His hand wound still

bleeding.  That's the blood I found

on the mast.

And

the twine.

ISHMAEL

He

cuts

the lantern free, the

freighter's wake

hits

, the boat

rolls

hard

, his bloody hand

slips

.

tracing blood along the mast...

ISHMAEL

He falls.  The lantern, the knife,

go

into

the water.  Same as Carl.

ISHMAEL

And inside the cabin, a coffee

cup falls off the counter.

ISHMAEL

But there's no one around.  To

pick it up.

NELS

Still a coincidence.  Timing

and all.

ISHMAEL

The freighter started through

at 1:42.  The sea water seeped

into Carl's watch and stopped it.

At 1:47.

NELS

Still and all.  Carl was a strong

swimmer, he m...

ISHMAEL

He hit his head.  On the way in.

NELS

You think so?

ISHMAEL

The sheriff and the deputy and I

inspected the deck closely.  We

found a small fracture in the wood

of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.

NELS

Well, anything coulda caused that.

ISHMAEL

Anything.  That had a blond hair.

NELS

Request introduction of Exhibit 18.

One single blond hair.  Which Sheriff

Moran dug out of that fracture.  Below

the mast.  Of Carl Heine's boat.

NELS

We will call Sheriff Moran, who

will confirm this.  And Coroner

Whaley to testify that the damage

to the gunnel is of a size and

nature not inconsistent with the

deceased's skull fracture...

NELS

But for now.  Your witness...

HOOKS

I have to start reading your

paper more closely.  You're quite

a storyteller.

ISHMAEL (straight back)

Thank you.  Coming from the man who

wrote, 'But here, adrift in the fog,

I

plead

for your help'...that's quite

a compliment.

HOOKS

Everything

had to happen

just

right.  For your little story to

fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be

on that gunnel for a

lot

of reasons.

ISHMAEL

I'm sorry, was there a question

in there?

HOOKS

Well, the freighter.  The twine.

The blood.  The knife.  The cup.

The watch.  The second battery.

The phantom lantern.  The fishing

gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The

skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's

eleven

things...

ISHMAEL

Twelve.

HOOKS

I stand corrected, sir.  And you

have a neat explanation for every

one of them.

HOOKS

And since you confess this is

all pure guesswork.  What is your

expertise, sir, are you a detective

of sorts?

ISHMAEL

My expertise.  Is that I'm a

journalist.

ISHMAEL

And journalism.  Is balance.  Finding

the facts folks need to know.

ISHMAEL

Then putting them together.  So

truth is revealed.

HOOKS

But isn't the

truth

that there are

several

other ways to explain

each

of these twelve pieces.

ISHMAEL

Oh, yes.

ISHMAEL

But

no

other way.  To explain

them all.

ISHMAEL

And since they

all

happened.

This is the only explanation

that's the truth.

HOOKS

Your line of work.  You must meet

a lot of men play fast and loose

with the truth.

ISHMAEL

Like you couldn't believe.

HOOKS

Well, the defendant is a liar.

He's confessed that much.  And his

explanation is...he was afraid.

HOOKS

Afraid that the good folks of

this jury.  Would be too stupid

to understand.  Too prejudiced

to be fair.

HOOKS

You buy that?

ISHMAEL (gently)

I think he was greedy.

HOOKS

Greedy.

ISHMAEL

He didn't want to lose any more.

ISHMAEL

He'd lost a lot in the war, you

see.  I had sent him away.  To a

concentration camp.  But a nice

one.

Far

less brutal than the Nazis.

Because I'm a civilized person.

HOOKS

I asked you a question, you're writing

a tract, h...

ISHMAEL

That's how journalists.  Answer

questions.

ISHMAEL

May I answer the question, Your

Honor?  Anout the defendant's

motivation to lie?

JUDGE

I wouldn't miss it for the world,

son.  Now, you say

you

sent the

defendant to Manzanar?

ISHMAEL

I didn't say.  I did it alone.

ISHMAEL

So there he was.  His father lost

his health there, finally died.

They lost more than Etta Heine's

seven acres.  They lost their

liberty, their dignity.  Their

ideals about this country.

ISHMAEL

They lost their trust in us.  We

had treated them worse than animals.

How would we now see tham.  As human

beings?

ISHMAEL

This man lost a lot in the war.

He didn't want now to lose his

babies.  Or the woman who loves him.

ISHMAEL

And my expertise in this, sir.  Is

that I lost a lot in the war myself.

ISHMAEL

And the fact that I am the only

witness.  Who placed his

right

hand

upon the Holy Bible.  Is the

least

of it, sir.  I assure you of that.

HOOKS

Well, sir.  I hate to spoil the

soliloquy, I truly do.  But the

fact is...you are not on trial here.

Nor is Judge Fielding, or myself.

Nor the good people of this jury.

For events that took place twelve

years ago.

HOOKS

And I wouldn't blame these good

people if they were a mite resent-

ful.  At a tactic that insults

their intelligence.

ISHMAEL

That's curious.  I was

appealing

to their intelligence.

HOOKS

Were

you, sir?  Can you

prove

one

word of all your fancy story?

ISHMAEL

No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a

reasonable doubt.

ISHMAEL

It's fortunate that the man who

needs

to prove

his

fancy story.

Beyond a reasonable doubt.  Is

someone else.

ISHMAEL

I'm sorry, Mr. Hooks.  I apologize

for my tone.  This is not a contest.

Between you and me.

ISHMAEL

For it is not.  As Mr. Gudmundsson

so wisely put it.  A small trial.

In a small place.

ISHMAEL

I lost more in that war than

anyone will ever know.  So did

a lot of folks.  And what we got

back in return...

ISHMAEL

...was a country.  Where a man

was innocent.  Until we

proved

him guilty.

ISHMAEL

Whether we all got cheated.

We're about to find out.

NELS (O.S.)

All things considered...

NELS

...you were adequate.

NELS

I could make a few quibbles, but

I am loathe to hurt your feelings.

ISHMAEL

Cigarette?

NELS

I'll take two.  One for later.

NELS (quietly)

She is simply.  Beautiful.

ISHMAEL

I've always thought so.

NELS

If I whistle.  Those boys'll see

you, and come runnin'.

You're

the story today.

ISHMAEL

You ever been strangled by a

single hand?

NELS

Naw, I've seen what that can do

to a pack of cigarettes.

ISHMAEL

Better take three...

ISHMAEL

Maybe they'll keep us waiting.

NELS (very quiet)

Maybe they won't.

NELS

Prejudice is like any obsession.

NELS

There's a reason why we can't

let go.  Even when we want to.

ISHMAEL

A reason.

NELS (simply)

We don't want to.

NELS

Hate or love.  It works the same.

ISHMAEL

Your client's wife ever mention?

We go way ba...

NELS (softly)

Her mother.  May have said

something.

ISHMAEL

We don't let go, you s...

NELS

It's a rare thing.  Takes a

turning point.

NELS

You gave this jury three chances.

To turn.

NELS

No

other way to explain it

all

.

That was one.  I caught some of

'em fluttering, waking up, on that.

NELS

Second.

You

sent him to

Manzanar, and you didn't do

it

alone

.  I liked that one,

they didn't.  No surprise.

NELS

Last.  You gave your arm.  To

buy this woman back her husband.

Are they gonna cheat you out of that?

BAILIFF (O.S., calling out)

JURY'S COMIN' IN...

NELS

Some let go, some don't.  Where

did you?

ISHMAEL (a murmur)

Hooks called her deceitful.

And I knew she wasn't.

ISHMAEL

She was an honest person.  Doing

the best she could.

NELS (O.S.)

The prosecutor, the judge, cut

her off.  She was desperate.  Her

husband helpless...I was helpless...

NELS

You couldn't let her.  Be

helpless.

NELS

When this verdict is read.  She

may look for your face.

NELS

Here's what she needs to see:  This

is nothing.  We win it on appeal.

ISHMAEL

It'll be there.

JUDGE (clears his throat)

Mister foreman, has the jury

reached a verdict?

HAROLD JENSEN

We have, Your Honor.

JUDGE

Will the bailiff please bring

the verdict to the bench.

JUDGE (softly)

Will the defendant please rise.

JUDGE (O.S.)

Will the foreman please read the

verdict aloud.

HAROLD JENSEN (reads)

We the jury, find the defendant,

Kabuo Kenji Miyamoto, to be not

guilty of the cri...

HAROLD JENSEN (continues)

...of the crime with which he

has been char...

JUDGE

This is your verdict, so say

you all?

JUDGE

This Court thanks you for the

good work you have done under

difficult circumstances...

JUDGE

Go home, son.  God bless.

REPORTER #1

And how about the jury?  You had

confidence they'd see justice done?

KABUO

Oh, sure.  These are our neighbors,

you know.  They've got good

hearts.  We could see they were

following the evidence real close...

KABUO

We're just grateful to every one

of them.

REPORTER #2

And you ma'am?  You felt the same

as your husband, I expect?

HATSUE

Honestly, no.

HATSUE (quietly)

I felt my husband would be found

guilty.  Unless proven innocent.

HATSUE

And Mr. Chambers did that.

REPORTER #3

...can we get some background on

your handsome family?  I understand

you two were childhood sweethearts...

KABUO

Well, no sir, not exactly.  We met

in the Manzanar camp, you see, so I

guess that was the most beautiful

place I've ever been.

KABUO

No, her first love was another

fella...

KABUO (O.S.)

I was the lucky one.

REPORTER #4

It all sounds very romantic,

ma'am.  Falling in love under

those circumstances...

HATSUE

He went off to the Army, right

from Manzanar.  And that last

night, we danced alone in the

desert...

HATSUE (O.S.)

I told him.  If you don't come

back alive, I'll kill you.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

God's kindness, my father said.

Despite the hardship...it reminds

us.  Of our place in things.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

What the hell.  Did he mean

by that?

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Things fall on us, I suppose.

From the sky.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Wars.  Freighters plowing through...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

And we seem...helpless.  Until we

understand.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Accident rules every corner of

the universe...

ISHMAEL (V.O.)

Except the chambers.  Of the

human heart.
