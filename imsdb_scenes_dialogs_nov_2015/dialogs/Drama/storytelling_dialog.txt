STORYTELLING

by

Todd Solondz

Final draft

MARCUS

Hey, you want to hear my short

story now?

VI

Huh?

MARCUS

(lifts a MS from a shelf by his bed)

I can read it to you.

VI

You mean, again?

MARCUS

Well, I changed the ending a

little.

VI

Oh. What happens now?

MARCUS

Well, actually, it's the same, but

longer. I think it's better.

More...raw.

VI

Well then, maybe you should just

read the ending.

MARCUS

But it won't make any sense if you

hear it out of context.

VI

I think you should leave it the

way it was. It was good.

MARCUS

So you don't want to hear my new

ending?

VI

You'll read it in class tomorrow.

Surprise me.

(beat)

Anyway, I have to go. I promised

Melinda I'd help her with her

oral.

MARCUS

You're tired of me. I can tell.

VI

Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.

MARCUS

You've lost interest...You hardly

even sweat any more when we

have sex.

VI

I was never much of a sweater. You

know that.

MARCUS

Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You

feel You feel pity now. The

pleasure isn't there any more. The

kinkiness has gone...You've

become kind.

MARCUS

"...but when he saw her...it was

as if he could walk like a

normal person. His legs didn't

swing, his arms didn't spaz

away...He wasn't a freak any more,

for she made him forget his

affliction. No more cerebral

palsy! From now on  "CP" stood

for...cerebral person. He was a

cerebral person.

AMY

I thought it was really good,

Marcus...Really moving and

emotional.

ELLI

Yeah, I thought it was really

emotional, too.

AMY

And I mean, really good word

choices. It kind of reminded me a

little of Faulkner, but East Coast

and disabled.

LUCY

Or Flannery O'Connor. She had

multiple sclerosis.

JOYCE

And Borges. He was blind.

ETHAN

Updike has psoriasis.

CATHERINE

Um...Maybe I'm wrong, but, um, I'm

afraid I found the whole thing to

be a little trite. Its earnestness

is, well...it's a little

embarrassing. And those

adjectives, they're a little

flatfooted. And redundant. I'm

sorry, but...Anyway, what do I

know? Don't even listen to what I

say. I mean...

MR SCOTT

Anyone else?

MR SCOTT

Catherine is right. The story's a

piece of shit. You express nothing

but banalities and, formally

speaking, are unable to construct

a single compelling sentence. You

ride on a wave of cliches so worn,

in fact, it actually approaches a

level of grotesquerie. Ad your

subtitle, 'the rawness of truth'

is that supposed to be a joke of

some sort? Or are you just being

pretentious?

(beat; then checking his class book)

OK. Who's next?

VI

Marcus, wait up!

MARCUS

What do you want?

VI

Don't be so upset. It's OK...

MARCUS

What the fuck are you talking

about? What's OK?

VI

(beat)

You know he hated my story also.

MARCUS

Your story was terrible!

VI

Marcus...You'll write something

better next time!

MARCUS

Patronizing fuck! If you had just

been honest with me in the first

place I wouldn't have read it. I

knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I

believed you!

VI

That's not fair! I was honest!

Just because I wasn't sucking up

like 	that bitch Catherine.

MARCUS

Well, I sure didn't hear you voice

your opinion in there when it

mattered.

VI

I admit it - I was scared! I was

shocked, in fact , by what he

said. And he's so...convincing.

I'm sorry if I let you down, but

really, I still say he's just

one opinion. I don't even like his

books that much. They're all so

aggressively confrontational. I

don't care if he's won the

Pulitzer Prize.

MARCUS

You just want to fuck him. Like

Catherine and every other white

cunt on campus.

VI (O.S)

(on phone)

...But Marcus! You can't just

unilaterally decide to end things.

This is a relationship we're

talking about! A friendship! You

don't just...Fuck you!

VI(cont'd)

Fuck him! Fuck him! Fuck him...

MELINDA

Vi? Are you OK?

VI

Yes. I'm OK. I'm totally OK.

MELINDA

You did the right thing.

VI

I know that. Fucking cripple. Why

do I waste my time with

undergrads? They're all

so...juvenile! Uch! I just thought

Marcus would be different. I

mean he's got CP!

MELINDA

What are you gonna do now?

VI

I dunno...go to a bar...get

laid...whatever...Don't worry

about me. I'll be fine...

VI

Can I have a beer?

VI(cont'd)

Hi.

MR SCOTT

Hello, Vi.

VI

What are you doing here?

MR SCOTT

What are you doing here?

VI

I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just

didn't expect to run into you

here, that's all.

MR SCOTT

Well, now you have.

VI

Yeah, um, then...are you alone?

MR SCOTT

Uh huh.

VI

Can I join you?

VI(cont'd)

Gee, thanks. Well, um...I just

wanted to say that I'm really

happy with the class and,

um...I know you must here this all

the time, but I'm also a

great admirer of your work. A

Sunday Lynching,

especially...really, um spoke to

me. God, I hope I'm not

embarrassing you...

MR SCOTT

You're not.

VI

Good.

(beat)

'Cause I...um...I really agreed

with everything you had to say

last week about how bad my story

was...

MR SCOTT

That's good.

VI

And I also agreed with what you

said today about Marcus's story.

It is a piece of shit.

MR SCOTT

You have beautiful skin.

VI

Thank you.

(beat)

So Catherine seems like she might

become a really good writer.

MR SCOTT

Maybe. She's OK.

VI

Aren't you going out with

Catherine?

(beat)

I'm sorry. It's none of my

business. I didn't mean...

MR SCOTT

I'm not 'going out' with

Catherine.

VI

Oh.

(beat)

Do you think I have a potential as

a writer?

MR SCOTT

No.

VI

Thank you for being honest.

VI

I have so much respect for you.

VI

Can I just freshen up for a

second?

MR SCOTT

It's over there.

VI

Thanks.

VI

(to herself, almost chanting)

Don't be a racist. Don't be a

racist. Don't be a racist...

VI

It's a really nice place you have.

Is the rent high?

MR SCOTT

Take off your top.

MR SCOTT

Now...take off the rest.

MR SCOTT

Turn around.

MR SCOTT

Bend over.

MR SCOTT(cont'd)

(whispers)

Say, 'nigger, fuck me.'

VI

Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.

MR SCOTT

Say, Ni...

VI

Ni...

MR SCOTT

...gger.

VI

...gger.

MR SCOTT

Say, 'Nigger.'

VI

Nigger.

MR SCOTT

'Fuck me hard!'

VI

Fuck me hard!

MR SCOTT

Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'

VI

Nigger, fuck me hard!

MR SCOTT

Again!

VI

Nigger, fuck me hard!!...

MR SCOTT

Again!!

VI

NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...

MARCUS

Freak.

VI

Can I come in?

MARCUS

You're all...sweaty!

VI

'...So John flipped her around and

slammed her against the wall. Jane

braced herself: she thought about

her mother. She thought about

Peter. She thought about God...and

rape. ''Say, 'Fuck me, nigger.

Fuck me hard.''' John's flesh

abraded her soft skin. There would

be marks. She acquiesced, and said

what he asked her to say, and did

what he asked her to do. She had

entered college with hope, with

dignity, but she would graduate as

a whore.'

AMY

Why do people have to be so

ugly...write about such ugly

characters? It's perverted. I know

you all think I'm being prisssy,

but I don't care. I was brought up

in a certain way. And this

is...mean-spirited!

JOYCE

Yeah, well, it did seem a little

affected. Like by using taboo

language you were trying to shock

us about the hollowness of your

characters.

ETHAN

I think it was a little bit

racist.

ELLI

It was completely racist, and

beyond that I felt deeply offended

as a 	woman. As if a woman can

only operate from experiences of

objectification.

SUE

Totally phallocentric.

ELLI

And so weirdly misogynistic. I

mean, why does Jane go through

with this? Is she stupid?

ETHAN

Hey, But wasn't this a rape? Or

...did I miss something? Because I

- I'm confused. Because if this

was a rape, then why would she be

a whore?

CATHERINE

(beat)

It was confessional, yet

dishonest. Jane pretends to be

horrified by 	the sexuality that

she in fact fetishizes. She

subsumes herself to the myth of

black male potency, but then

doesn't follow through. She thinks

she 'respects Afro-Americans,' she

thinks they're 'cool,' 'exotic,'

what a notch he 'd make in her

belt, but, of course, it all comes

down to mandingo cliche, and he

calls her on it. In classic racist

tradition she demonizes, then runs

for cover. But then, how could she

behave otherwise? She's just a

spoiled suburban white girl with a

Benneton rainbow complex. It's

just my opinion, and what do I

know...but I think it's a callow

piece of writing.

MR SCOTT

Callow and coy. Jane wants more,

but isn't honest enough to admit

it. In the end, she returns to the

safety of her crippled

(translation: sexually impotent)

boyfriend.

MARCUS

This is bullshit! Her story was

the truth!

JOYCE

Right.

SUE

It's unbelievable!

ELLI

It's cliched!

AMY

It's disgusting!

VI

But it happened!

MR SCOTT

I don't know about 'what

happened,' Vi, because once you

start writing, it  all becomes

fiction. Still, it certainly is an

improvement over your last story:

There is now at least a beginning,

a middle, and an end.

PAM (V.O.)

Hello?

TOBY

Hello, is this Pam?

PAM (V.O.)

Who is this?

TOBY

Toby Oxman.

PAM (V.O.)

Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?

TOBY

Oh, fine. How are you?

PAM (V.O.)

Great!

TOBY

Great!

PAM (V.O.)

So what's going on?

TOBY

That's what I was gonna ask you.

PAM (V.O.)

But...you called.

TOBY

Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just

calling because, well, I was

wondering if you still remembered

me, which I guess you do...

PAM (V.O.)

Yeah.

TOBY

So. Look at where we are: the year

2000! Can you believe it? I mean,

did you ever think we would

actually make it?

PAM (V.O.)

Um, well, yeah.

(beat)

So are you still acting?

TOBY

Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I

kind of came to terms with myself,

I realized I had done what I had

to do. And it was time to move on.

PAM (V.O.)

Oh. So what did you do after you

gave up on acting?

TOBY

Well, I went to law school, if you

can believe that.

PAM (V.O.)

I believe it.

TOBY

Yeah, well, it was really all kind

of a joke - and a rip-off, so,

uh...so I dropped out.

PAM (V.O.)

Oh, that's too bad.

TOBY

Yeah, well, then it got me

writing, so that was a good thing.

PAM (V.O.)

Anything I might know about?

TOBY

Well, um, I kind of let things go

on this novel I'd been really into

- I mean, the whole publishing

industry is totally corrupt. I

mean, really, it's finished.

PAM (V.O.)

That's too bad.

TOBY

I worked over at a homeless

shelter for a while, drove a cab

to pay the rent, but, I mean, that

was like - I mean, I have some

dignity.

PAM (V.O.)

That's good. So then what do you

do now?

TOBY

I'm a documentary filmmaker.

PAM (V.O.)

Oh? Anything I might have seen?

TOBY

N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a

grant for this one project on

teenagers. Geez, remember when we

were teenagers?

PAM (V.O.)

Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to

the prom.

TOBY

Oh, I don't remember that...

PAM (V.O.)

I do.

TOBY

Well, but it was so long ago. We

were so different back then...

TOBY (CONT'D)

Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking

for subjects for this documentary

on teenage life in suburbia. Kind

of an exploration of the mental

psyche of its mythology. I wrote

to Derrida to see if he'd like to

do the narration. But everything's

still kind of in development at

this point.

PAM (V.O.)

Hunh.

TOBY(beat)

I work in a shoe store right now.

But it's cool. I'm not ashamed. I

mean, really, I have a much

stronger sense of self now. And,

uh, anyways, it's really very

temporary.

PAM (V.O.)

That's good.

TOBY

Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me.

What about you? I'd heard through

the grapevine you were producing

movies.

PAM (V.O.)

Yeah. But not any more.

TOBY

Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast

lane'?

TOBY (CONT'D)

Yeah...So you're um...you're

married?

PAM (V.O.)

Yeah.

TOBY

Huh. Kids?

PAM (V.O.)

Yeah.

TOBY

How many?

PAM (V.O.)

Three.

TOBY

Great. How old are they?

PAM (V.O.)

Eight, six, and four.

TOBY

Wow, that really is great. In a

few years, who knows, maybe

they'll want to be in my

documentary!

PAM (V.O.)

Listen, Toby, I can't really talk

right now. Do you mind if I call

you back?

TOBY

Yeah, sure.

PAM (V.O.)

OK. Bye.

TOBY

(to himself, after pause)

Maybe she has caller ID.

MR. DEMARCO (V.O.)

Do you have any hobbies?

SCOOBY

No, not really.

MR. DEMARCO

Any books you like to read for

fun?

SCOOBY

No.

MR. DEMARCO

None at all? How about those

'underground' comics?

SCOOBY

I hate reading.

MR. DEMARCO

(beat)

All right, Scooby, let's not beat

around the bush. With your

attitude, you're not going to get

in anywhere.

SCOOBY

OK.

MR. DEMARCO

'OK.' So you just don't care.

(beat)

Let me ask you, not as your

guidance counselor, but...as a

friend: what do you want to

do with your life? I mean, what

kind of long-term goals can you

possibly have?

SCOOBY

I dunno...

MR. DEMARCO

C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what

you're thinking.

SCOOBY

Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV.

Maybe have a talk show or

something. Like Conan. Or early

Letterman.

MR. DEMARCO

Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to

achieve this goal?

SCOOBY

I dunno. See if I have any

connections.

FERN

Did you knock on his door?

MICKEY

Yes, but he just shouted at me and

used the f-word.

MARTY

Scooby! Dinner!

MICKEY

Would anyone be interested in

being hypnotized after dinner?

FERN/MARTY/BRADY

No.

FERN

Let's just start.

MARTY

I don't know what's wrong with

that kid.

BRADY

Maybe he's gay.

MARTY

Don't ever say that.

BRADY

What if he is?

MARTY

He isn't.

FERN

Marty, ignore him.

BRADY

He's vegetarian, doesn't do

sports...

MARTY

Brady!

FERN

And even if he is...

MIKEY

Gay people are people too, you

know. You're just being

prejudiced.

BRADY

I don't care is he's gay. I'm

cool. I mean, it's not like I have

to share his room or anything.

MARTY

I just want to know what the hell

he's doing in his room that's so

interesting he doesn't come down

for dinner.

MIKEY

Maybe he's building a bomb...just

like-!

FERN

Don't even joke about that!

MIKEY

I'm serious! What happens if he

blows up the school?

SCOOBY (O.S.)

Fuck!

MARTY

I'm going in there.

SCOOBY

Was anyone in my room today?

FERN

Is everything OK?

SCOOBY

My CD case like totally collapsed.

I'm gonna have to recatalogue all

weekend.

(sitting down)

Hey. Can you pass the salad over.

MARTY

(beat)

Steak's really good tonight.

SCOOBY

(beat)

Good.

FERN

Got a lot of homework?

SCOOBY

I dunno.

MARTY

Whaddya mean you don't know? You

either got a lot or you don't.

What's not to know?

FERN

Marty...

MARTY

(beat)

You started filling out your

college applications yet?

SCOOBY

I'm not going to college.

FERN

What are you going to do?

SCOOBY

I dunno.

MARTY

What DO you know?

SCOOBY

Dad, I'm trying to figure things

out right now, OK? It's like,

really hard, and I'm just

listening to some old Elton John

and...

MARTY

Out! Leave the table!

BRADY

What?

MARTY

You heard me: leave the table!

BRADY

(rising)

Man, I am out of here! This family

is so fucked!

MIKEY

Mom, it's not fair if Brady can

say the f-word and I can't.

MARTY

Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up.

Cause here's a lesson: life's not

fair.

BRADY

I'll talk to you later, man!

ESPOSITO

Yo, dude!

CHERYL

Thanks, Esposito!

MIKEY

Consuelo?

CONSUELO

Yes, Mikey?

MIKEY

Do you have any brothers or

sisters?

CONSUELO

Yes.

MIKEY

Really? How many?

CONSUELO

Four brothers and five sisters.

MIKEY

Wow.

(beat)

CONSUELO

It was God's will.

MIKEY

But do you really believe in God?

And heaven, hell and angels and

all kind of stuff?

CONSUELO

(beat)

No.

MARTY

So? How was school today?

SCOOBY

The same.

MARTY

The same. Same as what?

SCOOBY

Just the same.

BRADY

We're studying the Holocaust in

Social Studies.

MARTY

Oh, yeah?

SCOOBY

We did the same thing last year

also.

FERN

How was the class?

BRADY

Well, I'm supposed to watch

Schindler's List for homework. The

movie's like almost four hours.

And then I'm supposed to write a

report on survivors.

(to Marty)

You know any survivors, Dad?

MARTY

Hmmm...Do I know

any...personally...?

FERN

Well, technically your Zeda is a

survivor.

BRADY

He was in a concentration camp?

FERN

Well, no. But he had to escape the

Nazis.

BRADY

But I thought he came over to

America before the war.

FERN

Well, he did. With his family. But

his cousins, they had to stay and

they were all killed. And if he'd

stayed, he would have been killed.

So in my book he's a survivor.

BRADY

Even though it was only his

cousins that were killed?

FERN

But that could've happened to him.

Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or

you.

MIKEY

Or me?

SCOOBY

You mean, then, we're all

survivors?

FERN

Well...yes. If it hadn't been for

Hitler, he wouldn't have had to

leave Europe. We would have

been...European.

SCOOBY

But then, in a sense, since you

would never have met Dad if your

family had stayed in Europe...if

it weren't for Hitler, none of us

would have been born.

MARTY

Get the hell outta here!

SCOOBY

(rising)

Man, it's just, like,

conversation.

MR KIRK

Tell me: you make a living at

this?

TOBY

Well, sir...uh...I'm actually not

doing this for the money. When you

make a documentary, you do it for

many reasons, but money is

certainly not one of them.

MR KIRK

I don't get it.

TOBY

Well, sir, a lot has happened to

the landscape of the suburban high

school since I was a student, and

I feel it would be a valuable,

perhaps even enlightening

endeavor, to chronicle the

changes, to get intimate with the

realities kids and parents face in

American schools today.

MR KIRK

Yeah, well, whatever. I'll let you

know if there's interest.

TOBY

Excuse me, where's the bathroom?

SCOOBY

You a pervert?

TOBY

No...Actually, I'm a documentary

filmmaker?

SCOOBY

Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch

Project?

TOBY

Well, no. I'm doing one on high

school students, in fact.

SCOOBY

What for?

TOBY

Well...it's kind of a sociological

study in the aftermath of

Columbine.

SCOOBY

Is this to like get into Sundance?

TOBY

Yeah, well, it's possible they

would be interested in it.

SCOOBY

Doubt it.

TOBY

Actually, there is some interest

from the Sundance Channel.

SCOOBY

Whoopee.

TOBY

HBO and MTV have also shown some

interest.

SCOOBY

So you have connections...

TOBY (V.O.)

You see, we're trying to do a film

on suburban lifestyles...

TOBY

...kind of An American Family for

the new millennium...

FERN

I thought this was about kids

getting into college.

TOBY

Oh, it is. I mean

MARTY

Which is it? You gotta keep your

focus straight.

TOBY

You're absolutely right. The focus

is on the college admissions

process today.

MARTY

And you want Scooby to be the

focus of all this?

TOBY

Scooby and a few other students of

different socioeconomic

backgrounds.

MARTY

Oh, well, I don't have them yet,

but

MARTY

Either Scooby is the focus, or

forget it.

SCOOBY

Yeah, I thought I was the focus.

MIKEY

I wanna be the focus.

FERN

Toby, we need this to be a

positive experience.

TOBY

Well, I suppose I could

reconceive...

MARTY

Reconceive.

TOBY

'Cause Scooby does have a quality

that I've been looking for, a

quality that is emblematic of

American today. It's part

disillusionment, part hope...

MIKEY

Twinkeys!

FERN

Boys, take napkins...Napkins...

MARTY

Not to be crass, but what do we

get out of this?

FERN

(laughs)

Don't worry, he doesn't mean

money.

TOBY

Oh, I know, I know that. Well,

sharing your story, your ups and

downs, and so

forth, can I hope, be an

illuminating experience.

MARTY

Yeah...How do we know we won't be

exploited?

FERN

No, it's true.

TOBY

Mr Livingston, I fully understand

and I share your concerns. You

fell vulnerable. And I know that

this is a very difficult question,

but what it comes down to is: can

you make a leap of faith in me, in

the same way that I have to make a

leap of faith in you?

ESPOSITO

This is a great school. I don't

care what anybody says. I mean,

it's not perfect, but like the

people are really cool, like the

teachers and kids...they really

care and all. And I know that they

make fun of New Jersey all the

time, but I don't care. 'Cause

they're just snobs. 'Cause Jersey

is where America's at!

TOBY (V.O.)

Walking down these hallways just

like the ones I once walked down

as a teenager, I couldn't help

thinking back to a time when every

day I woke up depressed, suicidal,

consumed by despair. Had things

changed? Was the competition to

get into the most prestigious

schools still a requisite rite of

passage? Beneath these masks of

courtesy and friendliness I knew

that there were darker forces at

work...and I knew that Scooby was

the key to revealing the truth...

TOBY (V.O.)

Scooby, Scooby, Scooby...What are

you thinking? College, SATs, your

parents, your brothers, your

friends...How is it you deal with

all this stress?

ELIZABETH ST. CLAIR

The pressure to get into the

college of your choice is

incredible. You know, they did a

study recently of the youth in

Bosnia during the bombing, and

they found that the stress the

young people experienced there was

less than what American high-

school students go through when

applying to college.

TOBY (O.S.)

Is that right?

ELIZABETH ST. CLAIR

Yes.

TOBY (O.S.)

Oh, my God...

TOBY

So whaddya think?

EDITOR

Well, I'm not really sure what

you're trying to say. It's funny,

I suppose. But it seems glib and

facile to just make fun of how

idiotic these people are.

TOBY

I'm not making fun. I'm showing it

as it really is.

EDITOR

You're showing how superior you

are to your subject.

TOBY

No, but I like my subject. I like

these people.

EDITOR

No, you don't.

TOBY

Yes, I do. I love them!

EDITOR

The camerawork's nice.

TOBY

Thanks. I'll tell Mike.

(beat)

Well, it's still just a beginning.

I know I can...dig deeper.

FERN

...but Marj  may I call you Marj?

what it really boils down to

is...what does it mean to be a

Jew?...Exactly. Tzedakah. Charity.

And the new wing at Beth Israel

is...Well, actually, last year you

gave $500. But this year $1,000

would not only be a mitzvah, it

would bring you to a new

level...Yes, of course. Your gift

would also give you a Chagall

menorah and two tickets to the

dinner dance this spring...Because

it's true: Israel needs us now. If

not now, when?...Well, that's

wonderful...I'll speak to you next

week...You too! Take care!

FERN

Hi, Scooby! How was school today?

SCOOBY

Fine.

FERN

Ready for tomorrow?

SCOOBY

What's tomorrow?

FERN

The SATs, knucklehead.

SCOOBY

I'm not taking them.

MIKEY

Mom?

FERN

Yes, Mikey?

MIKEY

I was looking through Scooby's

SATs practice books this afternoon

and I took one of the practice

tests. Guess what score I got?

FERN

What?

MIKEY

550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only

in fifth grade!

MARTY

Scooby?

SCOOBY

Yeah?

MARTY

We have to talk.

SCOOBY

Whaddya wanna talk about?

MARTY

Don't screw around with me. You

know what I'm talking about.

(beat)

You're taking those SATs. You're

taking those SATs or your CD

collection is history. You're

taking those SATs and you're going

to college. You're taking those

SATs if I have to strap your ass

to a chair, but buddy your taking

them.

SCOOBY

OK.

MARTY

(under his breath as he starts walking away)

Tired of this shit...

TOBY

So are you surprised that Scooby

took the SATs after all?

BRADY

Not really. He's kind of a wuss.

TOBY

OK. How about you, Cheryl? Were

you surprised?

CHERYL

I dunno. Whatever.

TOBY

Hmm.

BRADY

Hey, how come you drive such a

shitty car?

CHERYL

Yeah.

TOBY

(joins their laughter)

I don't know...That's interesting,

though. A cool car. Is that

something that's real important to

you, Brady?

BRADY

Yeah.

CHERYL

Uh duh.

SCOOBY

Pretty cool, Stanley.

STANLEY

Thanks.

SCOOBY

How'd you get it?

STANLEY

It's my Dad's He hides it under

some old TV Guides in his closet.

SCOOBY

Gee, your Dad's smart.

STANLEY

I know.

SCOOBY

Is it loaded?

STANLEY

No, I don't think so...

STANLEY

Scooby, don't! Be careful!

SCOOBY

I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.

STANLEY

I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a

little nervous, I don't know why.

SCOOBY

You should be.

SCOOBY

Here. You can keep it.

STANLEY

Scooby?

SCOOBY

Yeah?

STANLEY

You know...I like you.

SCOOBY

Yeah. I know.

STANLEY

I mean...

STANLEY

I know. Everyone knows.

STANLEY

Oh.

(beat)

Do you think that you'd let

me...um...

SCOOBY

OK. If you feel like it. Just give

me a second.

SCOOBY

You want some?

STANLEY

No, thanks.

MARTY

I'm so sorry! I should never have

made you take the SATs!

CONAN

Hey, Scooby! How's it going?

SCOOBY

Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you

doing here?

CONAN

I'm looking for a last-minute

guest for my show. Any

suggestions?

SCOOBY

I'll be your guest!

CONAN

Really? Well, all right! Let's

take a look at the television and

see how we look.

SCOOBY

Cool!

CONAN

Welcome to the show, Scooby.

SCOOBY

Thank you.

CONAN

Nice to have you here.

SCOOBY

Great to be here.

CONAN

And thank you for dressing up for

us. This is very classy. Tell us.

What kind of professional plans do

you have? What's in your future?

SCOOBY

Well, I was thinking...I might

work for you.

CONAN

Ahh...tell me. What do you want to

do for me? What's your idea?

SCOOBY

Be your sidekick, you know, and

maybe eventually become a TV talk-

show host.

CONAN

TV talk-show host, OK. You were at

sidekick eight seconds ago, then

TV talk-show host. You'll be a

Latin dictator in a bout a minute.

CONAN

Let's see what they think of the

first idea. I'm curious

what the audience thinks. Folks,

what do you think: should Scooby

be my new sidekick?

CONAN

Scooby, new sidekick, everybody!

SCOOBY

Yeah?

BRADY

Hey.

SCOOBY

Hey. What's up?

BRADY

There's something I need to talk

about with you.

SCOOBY

What?

BRADY

There are some rumors...

SCOOBY

Like what?

BRADY

You know...Stanley...

SCOOBY

Oh.

BRADY

And like, don't take this the

wrong way...I mean, I'm

cool...but...you

know...I've got a good reputation

at school and, well...I really

don't want it ruined.

SCOOBY

No prob. I'm cool.

BRADY

Thanks, Scoob.

COACH

Esposito, What the fuck do you

think you're doing? You're

tackling like a bitch

on my football team, son! You

gotta bend your ass over and hit

somebody! You understand me?

ESPOSITO

Yes, sir!

COACH

You understand me?

ESPOSITO

Yes, sir!

COACH

Then do it!...Livingston! That's

the way to hit that hole, son!

COACH

We're gonna become a football team

today, guys! Let's move the ball!

Move! Move! Move! I wanna see you

hit those holes! Defense, fill

those goddam gaps! Let's go, guys!

Let's do it!...

MIKEY

When I'm in high school I'm not

going to play any football. I'm

just going to concentrate on class

rank.

(beat)

What did you do in high school?

CONSUELO

I did not go to high school.

MIKEY

Weren't there high schools in El

Salvador?

CONSUELO

We had to work. My family was

poor.

MIKEY

Must've been hard being poor.

CONSUELO

I'm still poor.

MIKEY

Hmmm.

(beat)

But, Consuelo, even though your

poor, don't you have any hobbies

or interests or anything?

CONSUELO

No, Mikey.

MIKEY

But like, what do you like to do

when you're not working?

CONSUELO

I'm always working.

MIKEY

But when you're not. Like now.

What do you like to do?

CONSUELO

This is work.

MIKEY

But it's not like real work. This

is just babysitting.

MIKEY

You know, your job's really not so

bad, if you think about it. You

should smile more often.

TOBY (V.O.)

When the sky is clear and the sun

is warm, you're reminded of how

beautiful things can be: a lamp

post, a sign, a straw wrapper

blowing in the wind...But when that

dark cloud appears, you realize

how fragile the balance of life

is.

DR JORDAN

When Brady first arrived at the

hospital he was unresponsive to

verbal stimuli. Wee performed a CT

scan which demonstrated a large

subdural hemotoma with mass

effect. Since the removal of the

subdural he's been in coma.

DR GOODMAN

When I first met the Livingstons

it was in the first twenty four

hours of Brady coming in after his

tragic football accident and they

were acting in a fairly typical

way...

MARTY

We're not the ones who need the

help. My son needs help.

DR GOODMAN

And you-

MARTY

My son's in there! He can't even

feed himself, he can't eat  I

don't even know if he's going to

be a vegetable or not, for

Chrissake!

TOBY (V.O.)

But what about Scooby? How would

this effect him? What meaning is

to be found in this?

EDITOR

This is definitely better.

TOBY

You think so? You don't think that

this might not be a little dry?

EDITOR

This is entertainment you're

making, Toby. This story about a

kid in the suburbs and the state

of the college admissions process

has, with this Brady crisis,

evolved into something much richer

and more provocative.

TOBY

Yes, I know...But still, it should

be somewhat entertaining.

EDITOR

I mean, without this footage,

without this rigorous

documentation, it would feel

like exploitation.

TOBY

No, no, no. No exploitation. This

is serious...But don't you find it a

little funny too, at the same

time?

EDITOR

You've got a family tragedy on

your hands. Will you tell me

what's funny about that? About a

kid in a coma?

TOBY

Nothing, I guess...

EDITOR

I mean, why are you making this

documentary if you can't treat

your subject with appropriate

gravity?

TOBY

OK, you're right, you're right...

(beat)

You know, we need to screen what

we've got...invite some regular

people, just some random off-the-

street types...and see what real

people think of this.

EDITOR

I dunno, Toby. We really have a

long way to go. You still need a

lot more footage, and it's

probably a little premature to

start screening...

TOBY

OK, then we can invite serious

intellectual types.

EDITOR

We're not ready.

TOBY

Hip alternative types who will

understand the process better...

EDITOR

We're not ready!

TOBY

Well, I need to see this with an

audience!

EDITOR

What's an audience going to tell

you?

TOBY

I don't know. Maybe they'll like

it.

MIKEY

Consuelo! I spilled some grape

juice on the floor!...Consuelo?!

MIKEY

Consuelo?

MIKEY

Consuelo. Are you crying?

CONSUELO

No.

MIKEY

Yes, you are. I can tell. What's

the matter?

CONSUELO

Mi Jesus...mi jesus...

MIKEY

Speak English.

CONSUELO

Mi Jesus esta muerto!

MIKEY

Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know

if you don't speak English I can't

understand you.

CONSUELO

My Jesus...

MIKEY

Who is Jesus?

CONSUELO

My baby.

MIKEY

You have a bay?

CONSUELO

My grandchild-baby.

MIKEY

Gee, I didn't even know you had

any children. But why are you so

upset about Jesus?

CONSUELO

He's dead.

MIKEY

Oh. How did it happen?

CONSUELO

He was executed. He was on Death

Row and then he was executed.

MIKEY

How did they execute him?

CONSUELO

Poison gas.

MIKEY

(beat)

Maybe it's for the best...I mean, if

he was guilty of doing  something

wrong...People who are bad should be

killed. Don't you think so?

CONSUELO

Jesus was not bad.

MIKEY

Maybe he was and you just didn't

know it.

CONSUELO

He wasn't.

MIKEY

But still, you can't be sure.

CONSUELO

I am sure.

MIKEY

But really, you never know.

CONSUELO

I know!

MIKEY

(beat)

Why was he on Death Row?

CONSUELO

For rape and murder.

MIKEY

Consuelo, what is rape exactly?

CONSUELO

(beat)

It is when you love someone, and

they don't love you. And then you

do something about it.

MIKEY

Sometimes I feel like my parents

don't love me.

CONSUELO

Well then, when you get older you

can do something about it.

MIKEY

Consuelo? I spilled some grape

juice upstairs. Do you think you

could clean up the floor now?

MIKEY

Dad?...Do you think that Brady will

ever get better?

MARTY

One in a million recover.

MIKEY

Maybe he's that one in a million!

MARTY

Mikey, there's optimism, and then

there's stupidity. It's a very

fine line.

MIKEY

I don't think there's any hope,

either. I was just trying to make

you feel better.

MARTY

Thanks.

MIKEY

You're welcome.

(beat)

Dad?...Would you let me try

hypnotizing you now?

MARTY

Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.

MIKEY

OK. Stay there. I'll be right

back.

MIKEY

Just a sec!...Be right there!

MIKEY

Dad, can you turn around a bit,

please?

MIKEY

Thanks. All right. Now you must

look at this shiny object and

concentrate. Relax your legs.

Relax your arms. Relax your

shoulders. Now keep your eyes on

the shiny object...Your eyelids

are getting heavy...heavier...You're

getting sleepy...sleepier...Now let

your eyes close shut...and you

are asleep.

MIKEY

Now you are completely under my

power. I am the only voice you can

hear, the only voice you will

listen to. Now. When you wake up

you will be in a good mood. You

won't worry so much about Brady.

And I will be your favorite from

now on. If Brady dies, you can be

sad for a little bit, but I will

still be the most important person

in your life. You will never be

mean to me, and always give me

whatever I want. Also, you should

fire Consuelo. She's lazy. Now

when I snap my fingers, you will

remember nothing, but you will do

everything I have asked. One. Two.

Three.

MARTY

Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice

cream?

MIKEY

OK!

SCOOBY

So like, yeah...I caved in. I mean,

I had to. My parents, they're like

...still really depressed about

Brady. So I wrote the bullshit

essay. Filled out the

applications, did the

interviews...Y'know, I figure I can

always drop out.

TOBY (O.S.)

So where'd you get in?

SCOOBY

Prnceton.

TOBY (O.S.)

(beat)

But what did you get on your SATs?

SCOOBY

200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird,

I know. But I think they thought

it was, like, good-weird.

MARTY

We used pull.

FERN

You know, you have to. Sometimes

you just have to, Toby.

TOBY (O.S.)

But what kind of pull did you

have?

MARTY

I have a cousin. Very big giver to

the alumni fund.

FERN

It's all about who you know.

MARTY

Look, we're not suckers. Everyone

else is out there doing the same

thing.

FERN

He's right.

MIKE

Damn, Toby...This thing won't open

again.

TOBY

Let me try it, let me try it.

(takes camera from Mike)

It's um...The button is just stuck.

SCOOBY

Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering...Is

the documentary almost finished?

TOBY

Uh, yeah, we're getting there.

SCOOBY

Can I see what you have so far?

TOBY

Sure...um...yeah, as soon as I have a

screening I'll let you know.

SCOOBY

Thanks man.

MIKEY

Gin! I win! Let's play again!

MARTY

Hey, Mikey!

MIKEY

Hi, Dad!

MARTY

Come here, give me a hug!

MIKEY

Gee, you're home early!

MARTY

Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go

upstairs and keep your Mom and

Brady company for a bit? I need to

speak alone with Consuelo for a

moment.

MIKEY

Sure, Dad.

MARTY

CONSUELO

I-I don't understand.

MARTY

We've been happy with you in the

past, but now we think maybe it's

time for a change...uh...I know you've

had trouble at home and maybe, you

know, some of that is reflected I

your work...

CONSUELO

But, Mr Livingston, I work very

hard for you and your family!

MARTY

I understand, I understand that,

and I'm sorry it had to end this

way.

DAVE

Florsheim. Can I help you?

SCOOBY (V.O.)

Hi. I...uh...I'm trying to reach

Toby Oxman?

DAVE

Sorry, he's off today.

SCOOBY

OK...um...Thanks.

SCOOBY

Hey, uh, Mike. Is Toby here?

MIKE

Uh, no, he's not.

SCOOBY

Oh. Do you have any idea where he

might be?

MIKE

I think he's at a test screening.

MARTY

I think Scooby's like a lot of

kids. He just hit a...a speed bump.

Now he's gonna find his way, his

path is gonna be cleared, and I

think he's gonna continue his

education at a good college. And

everybody else is gonna be happy.

TOBY (O.S.)

...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a

bit fearful that Scooby will be

confronted with hollow values and

systemic conformism?

MARTY

I don't know why this is so hard

for you to comprehend. I had a

terrific time in college. I've got

a terrific job, a comfortable

salary, terrific wife, three

terrific kids...and every year I

give to the alumni fund. Now why

are you trying to make college out

to be a bad thing, a negative

experience? You were unhappy?

Well, to bad! Get over it! Stop

trying to impose your misery on

others by going around saying,

'Life is bad, life is horrible.'

Life is tough on you? Well, boo

hoo!

SCOOBY

...Well, yeah, my Dad is kind of a

goofball. I just have to pretend

to go along with his ideas. 'Cause

he really doesn't get it: like I

could be the next Oprah, for all

he knows, but he's never even seen

the show.

TOBY (O.S.)

What is most important to you?

SCOOBY

I dunno. I'd like to be good at

something. It doesn't have to be

TV. I mean, it could be

movies...Anything. I'd be willing

to direct.

SCOOBY

But I'd like to be, you

know...famous. Not necessarily a

superstar, just famous. Be

recognized. Get fan Mail.

Things...

TOBY (O.S.)

Uh, Scooby, now I understand how

you want to be a TV talk-show host

and all, like Conan O'Brien, but

did you know even he went to

college?

SCOOBY

He did?

TOBY (O.S.)

Yeah. He went to Harward.

SCOOBY

(beat)

Oh.

MIKEY

Mom? Dad? Can I sleep with you?

I'm scared.

MARTY

Sure!...

FERN

Of course, honey. Come in bed with

us. Come on.

MARTY

Snug as a bug in a rug. Yeah, here

you go, pal. All righty...You're

monster-proofed!

TOBY (O.S.)

Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so

sorry...I'm so, so sorry...

SCOOBY

Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
