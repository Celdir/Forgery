"WHEREVER THE BIRD WITH NO FEET FLEW, SHE FOUND TREES WITH NO

LIMBS." --- AUDRE LORDE

FADE IN:

1   EXT/INT. NIGHTCLUB- EVENING                                   1

A disembodied gaggle of jersey clad shoulders, jeans, and

hats crosses a narrow street. Lights flare, hands are

stamped, torsos are patted down. Money exchanges hands. We

descend into a black, throbbing tunnel.

Explicit music booms from bassy club speakers.   Hips, legs

feet dancing.

A GO-GO DANCER struts and wiggles around a brass pole.   Hoots

and cheers.

The dancer marches in place, rolling her thonged bottom.

More cheers, greedy hands stuff dollars into her waistband.

FEMALE DJ (O.S.)

Let's go! Where all my sexy

Sagittarian ladies at?

Arms go up.   A collection of whoops ripple the crowd.

The dancer wraps her legs around the pole and oozes upward

headfirst. The CAMERA ROTATES as she stretches her booted

heels into the crowd. We realize that she has been dancing

on the ceiling.

FEMALE DJ (O.S.)

Oh my God!

ALIKE (pronounced AH-LEE-KAY), 17, covers her mouth, laughing

and wide-eyed. She tries to back away from the stage, but is

pushed forward by a torrent of eager arms waving dollar

bills. Among them is LAURA, 18, worldly and smooth.

LAURA

Where your singles at?!! Where your

singles at?!! Yeah, baby!

Laura strains over Alike's shoulder to tuck a bill into the

dancer's boot. Alike drops her beer in all the jostling.

FEMALE DJ

Goddamn I love my job!

Laura stuffs a bill into Alike's now empty hand and forcibly

waves Alike's wrist in the air.

2.

Alike pulls free just as the dancer takes notice and begins

to direct her attention at her.

ALIKE

Stop! Chill!!

LAURA

Whatchu' come here for?!

Alike shoves the dollar bill into Laura's chest and shoulders

her way past the wall of onlookers surrounding the stage.

Laura shrugs, puts the bill in her teeth and lays her head at

the edge of the stage. Alike looks away and breaks through a

snarl of clubgoers just as the dancer begins to descend.

ALIKE

Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Oof,

sorry ladies.

Finally free of the throng, Alike takes a breath and looks at

the clock on her cell phone.

ALIKE (CONT'D)

Shit!

She rolls her eyes back to the stage where Laura is no longer

visible. Not daring to risk another plunge into the throbbing

crowd, she retreats for the bar.

FEMALE DJ

Let's go!

2   INT. NIGHTCLUB BAR- NIGHT                                     2

Alike beaches at an empty spot at the bar. Her gaze settles

on a CUTE GIRL a little ways down, staring out at the dance

floor. Alike jerks her eyes away and smooths the front of her

shirt and adjusts her hat as she edges toward the girl.

ALIKE

Hi.

The girl ignores her. Alike clears her throat and speaks a

little too loudly.

ALIKE (CONT'D)

Umm... Hey! How are you?!

The girl jerks around and frowns at Alike, looking her up and

down.

CUTE GIRL

What?!

3.

ALIKE

Umm...sorry. I was just sayin'

Umm...hi.

CUTE GIRL

Oh.

The girl dismisses Alike and turns back toward the floor.

ALIKE

Oh. You wanna drink or something?

Hey! Hey! Over here!

Alike strains, snapping at the bartender. A CONFIDENT WOMAN

swaggers up close to the girl and extends her hand. The cute

girl takes it and allows herself to be lead to the dance

floor. Alike looks around just in time to see her leaving.

The bartender finally materializes, and Alike slinks away.

3   INT. NIGHTCLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT                                  3

Alike slumps into a long line of women waiting to squeeze the

cramped, 2 stall bathroom. A COUPLE in front of her makes out

vigorously, and she folds her arms and looks away.

A buff 30-SOMETHING WOMAN with locs smiles and winks at

Alike. Alike smiles and fidgets with her eyebrows and looks

away. The line inches forward. Alike glances around

searching for the woman. The 30-something has already lost

interest, her attention now fully directed at a much more

FEMININE WOMAN strutting out of the restroom. Embarrassed,

Alike faces front again. Two androgynous gangsters (AGs) who

have witnessed the whole thing nudge each other and sneer.

Alike squares her shoulders and widens her stance. One of

the AG's breaks out in laughter and they turn around as the

line inches forward again. Alike pretends not to notice and

slumps out of line and retreats for a lonely oasis of couch

along the wall.

4   INT. NIGHTCLUB COUCH - LATER                                     4

Alike dozes on the couch.

FEMALE DJ

Give it up for Sin-A-Min ladies!!

Alike wakes with a start. She checks the time on her cell

phone. Cursing, she scrambles up from the couch.

4.

5   INT. NIGHTCLUB BAR - EVENING                                  5

Laura dances with a cute SHORT HAIRED GIRL.

Alike spots the pair from afar and heads in their direction.

ALIKE

C'mon, we're late.

LAURA

Huh?

ALIKE

I gotta go!

LAURA

Hold on a minute.

ALIKE

C'mon, why you trippin'?

LAURA

What?

ALIKE

Why are you trippin', you know I

gotta go!

LAURA

What?

ALIKE

You know I gotta go.   I'ma get in

trouble.

LAURA

Lemme dance with shortie first,

then I'll be ready.

ALIKE

What?

Laura spins the short haired on the dance floor and the pair

continue their wobbling, uneven groove. Alike endures several

moments of invisibility as a sea of women, both "feminine"

and "butch" push past her without a second glance. Alike tugs

at Laura's jersey. Laura, happily tangled in her dance

partner's embrace rolls her eyes.

LAURA

Stop pulling on my clothes!

5.

6   EXT. BUS STOP- NIGHT                                             6

Laura sulks, frowning out at the night. Alike extends the

olive branch.

ALIKE

How many numbers you get? One?

LAURA

I could've gotten more, but your

moms was holding me up.

ALIKE

Oooh.   That's jacked up.

LAURA

How many you get?

ALIKE

Tonya, Denise, Shelley. No wait

that's old, I can delete that one.

Tonya...

Laura snatches the phone from Alike. Alike swipes at it but

misses. Laura fends her off with one hand and scrolls through

the numbers with the other.

LAURA

Ain't Shelley that chick from your

math class?! Denise... What?

These are your damn study group

numbers! Why you frontin'?!

Alike snatches the phone and wipes the screen with her

sleeve.

ALIKE

I don't see you with no list of

numbers.

LAURA

I'm not the one looking for a

girlfriend, man. You the one still

a virgin!

ALIKE

Shut up!

LAURA

Trying to help your ass. I'm

sayin', whatchu waitin' for?!

Alike shrugs it off, her smile fading a little. Laura elbows

her and sneers.

6.

LAURA

Kickin' that same `ol quiet shit

since 6th grade. I don't need to

press, I gets plenty. Shit.

ALIKE

Wah-wah.

LAURA

I get more pussy than your daddy,

nigga, what?!

ALIKE

Oh shit!! Yeah, you got me with

that one.

7   INT. BUS - NIGHT                                              7

Alike becomes more quiet and less playful as the ride wears

on. A middle-class Bronx landscape, well-lit with a newly

constructed Starbucks and renovated condos flits by the

window. Alike reaches over and presses the tape. Laura elbows

Alike.

LAURA

Quit playing.

ALIKE

Your stop.

LAURA

Huh?

ALIKE

Your stop-- you're getting off

here, right?

LAURA

Nah, I'll roll with you a few more

stops.

ALIKE

Why you gon' walk all the way back

down for? That's stupid.

LAURA

Make sure you get home okay.

The bus pulls to the curb. The light flicks on over the back

door.

7.

ALIKE

You ain't big, nigga. Trying to

protect somebody. Hurry up, man,

get off!

LAURA

(to bus driver)

That's alright man--next stop. Next

stop!

Alike elbows Laura sharply. The bus driver frowns in the rear

view.

LAURA

You ain't gotta push me, why're you

beastin'?

ALIKE

I'm not beastin'.

Laura climbs over Alike and swings toward the door.

LAURA

You got a problem. Call me.

ALIKE

I'ma call you.

Alike turns and watches Laura stroll away. Laura drums a

little beat on Alike's window as the bus pulls off. Alike

waves and faces forward again. An OLD LADY sitting nearby

shoots her a disapproving look. Alike rolls her eyes and

moves to a seat farther away.

8   INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS                                         8

Alike studies her reflection in the window, and takes a

breath. She unbuttons her bulky men's shirt to reveal a

fitting baby doll shirt that reads "Princess." She stuffs

her baseball cap and durag into her backpack and jabs a pair

of small gold hoop earrings into her ears. She slumps back

against the seat and stares into the night.

The bus stops at a lonely island of curb. Alike is a dark

silhouette sprinting around the corner and into the night.

9   INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                9

Alike cracks open the front door just wide enough to slip

through. The house is dark except for the flashing microwave

clock.

8.

Alike takes off her sneakers and pads down the hallway. Her

younger sister, SHARONDA's door cracks open as she passes.

SHARONDA

You late.

ALIKE

(whispering)

Be quiet.

SHARONDA

Where you been this late?

ALIKE

(whispering)

Movies.

SHARONDA

Movie ended at midnight.

ALIKE

(whispering)

Shhh. Shut up.

Alike shoves her sister and tries to close the door. Sharonda

yanks the door open wider.

SHARONDA

(whispering)

Don't push me.

ALIKE

(whispering)

Go to bed.

SHARONDA

I know what stays open past

midnight.

Sharonda puts a hand to her head and does a little dance.

ALIKE

Shut up!

Alike eases Sharonda's door shut.     Sharonda swings the door

open wide.

SHARONDA

Good night Lee!

Sharonda slams her door.      The light clicks on underneath

Alike's parent's door.

9.

AUDREY (O.S.)

Lee? Lee?!

10   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     10

AUDREY

Nice to know you still live here.

AUDREY (CONT'D)

What're you doing home so late,

anyway?

ALIKE

Lost track of time.

AUDREY

You know what time your curfew is.

Where were you?

ALIKE

Movies.

AUDREY

The show ended at midnight. And

your curfew is twelve thirty.

ALIKE

I lost track of time.

AUDREY

At least you were cute. Where'd you

get that shirt? `Princess'. I like

that.

ALIKE

It's old.

10.

AUDREY

Compliments your figure. I saw

something just like it on sale,

maybe we could go shopping--

ALIKE

Goodnight.

AUDREY

I really don't care for that young

lady you run around with anyway.

ALIKE

Yeah, okay!

AUDREY

And tie your head up.

AUDREY(CONT'D)

It's your head. And you really

should wash your face, too.

ALIKE

I don't have on make-up.

AUDREY

Wash your face anyway.

ALIKE

Mom. I'm seventeen years old,

please don't talk to me like--

AUDREY

Watch your tone.

(Beat)

Well, it's your skin.

ALIKE

Nothin' you can eat.

MRS. ALVARADO

You shouldn't be eatin' that crap,

ALIKE

(over a mouthful of pizza)

I know.

MRS. ALVARADO

Sooo, where's the new stuff?

MRS. ALVARADO

Hmmm.

ALIKE

Did you see the one in the back?

ALIKE (CONT'D)

I'll probably do it in class.

ALIKE

So?

MRS. ALVARADO

So what?

14.

ALIKE

What do you think?

MRS. ALVARADO

They're okay.

ALIKE

Okay?

MRS. ALVARADO

They're lovely. Of course your

descriptiveness and use of

alliteration is beautiful and all,

you know that. But...I don't know.

Is it your best? No.

ALIKE

I thought it was good.

MRS. ALVARADO

It's good. Not great.

MRS. ALVARADO

I believe you can go deeper.

19   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON                           19

AUDREY

AUDREY

CLERK

No ma'am I--

AUDREY

Then I suggest you get busy.

20   INT. HOSPITAL BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        20

MRS. SINGLETARY

Hey girl! Mind if I sit here?

AUDREY

No, not at all. Help yourself.

MRS. SINGLETARY

Whatchu got there? You been

shopping?

AUDREY

Oh, no. Just some yogurt. Some

vanilla yogurt.

MRS. SINGLETARY

No I meant in the bag. What do you

have in the shopping bag--the big

red thing?

AUDREY

Oh I'm...I don't know where my mind

is...Yeah, this is just uh--well

let me get your opinion.

16.

MRS. SINGLETARY

Oh that's nice.

AUDREY

Yeah see isn't this cute?

MRS. SINGLETARY

Umm-hmm. That's for your daughter?

AUDREY

Yeah, this is for Alike.

MRS. SINGLETARY

The youngest one.

AUDREY

No she's the oldest one.

MRS. SINGLETARY

Oh, the other one. Okay.

AUDREY

What, you think it's too young?

MRS. SINGLETARY

No, no. For whatever reason the

youngest one popped in my mind

first. But I think it should be

fine. It's really cute.

AUDREY

Thank you.

MRS. SINGLETARY

It'll compliment her figure.

AUDREY

Now see that's what I thought...

But Lee doesn't like anything I

pick out for her anymore.

Mrs. Singletary takes a bite of her lunch and takes the

sweater from Audrey.

MRS. SINGLETARY

Girl, please. My oldest, 17 going

on 27 mind you, banned me from

buying her any more clothes. We

have two completely different

tastes. I just give her gift cards

now and trust me, we're both

happier for it. Is it her birthday?

17.

Mrs. Singletary hands the sweater back to Audrey who smooths

it carefully back into the tissue paper.

AUDREY

No, no. I just wanted to get her

something nice. You know.

Three ROWDY CO-WORKERS burst into the room chattering and

finger popping.

ROWDY CO-WORKER #1

Hey, Brenda!

ROWDY CO-WORKER #2              ROWDY CO-WORKER #3

Oooooh Audrey, you got me a     What'chall in here talking

present?                        about?

AUDREY

Well, no we--

MRS. SINGLETARY

None of yo' damn business!!

The co-workers hoot in unison and descend upon the various

parts of the breakroom. Audrey shoves the sweater back in the

bag and nestles it between her feet. Somebody cranks on a

small radio and a frisky R&B beat invades the air. Mrs.

Singletary pats Audrey on the arm.

MRS. SINGLETARY

Let me know how it goes.

AUDREY

Oh I will. I'll call you when--

ROWDY CO-WORKER #3

Hey Bren' this is what I was

telling you about!!

Co-worker #3 shoves a tabloid in Mrs. Singletary's face,

tapping an angry orange fingernail in the middle of the page.

MRS. SINGLETARY

Is that her?!

ROWDY CO-WORKER #3              ROWDY CO-WORKER #2

Told you!                       Look how big she done got!

The center of the room shifts and Audrey is once again alone

at the fringes. She collects her shopping bag and looks

around to say goodbye, but no one notices her leave.

18.

21   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - EVENING                            21

SHARONDA

I don't see why we can't just watch

TV like usual.

SHARONDA

Quit it!

ALIKE

Shut up.

SHARONDA

You don't tell me what to do!

AUDREY

Girls.

ARTHUR

I'm expecting a call.

AUDREY

This is your father's night off.

AUDREY (CONT'D)

So straighten up.

SHARONDA

Homecoming got moved this year.

It's gonna be in September instead

of October.

19.

AUDREY

Oh really?

SHARONDA

Yeah. Which means I'll be able to

go to Autumn Ball and the

Homecoming Dance.

AUDREY

Who are you going with?

SHARONDA

I don't know. Maybe Derek. If he

asks me. Maybe Parrish. I haven't

decided yet. But for homecoming, I

definitely want to go with Craig.

AUDREY

Oooh, I see. Lee, who are you

going with?

ALIKE

Umm. I'm not going.

Arthur gives Alike an approving Daddy's girl wink. Alike

beams back.

AUDREY

Not going? This is your junior

year. How can you not go?

ARTHUR

Leave her alone Audrey, if doesn't

want to go, she doesn't have to go.

AUDREY

But it's her junior year, she's not

gonna have any memories.

ARTHUR

I don't like all those boys buzzing

around my daughters anyway.

SHARONDA

Nobody buzzes around Alike.

ARTHUR

That's right and it better stay

that way. Matter of fact, I don't

know if I'ma let you go.

SHARONDA

Daaa-aad?!

22   INT. LAURA'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                                 22

LAURA

How much we paid him last time?

CANDACE

Six twenty-five.

LAURA

So that makes--we owe another two

seventy-five for the rest of the

month.

LAURA (CONT'D)

Electric?

CANDACE

Half.

LAURA

Phone?

CANDACE

Let it ride.

LAURA

Gas?

CANDACE

How much?

LAURA

Eighty-five.

CANDACE

Half. No let it ride.

21.

Candace reaches inside a CERAMIC HEN on the table and pulls

out a wad of money. She counts out several hundred dollars

into an envelope.

LAURA

I can get some more hours--

CANDACE

No. You know what you need to do.

LAURA

Nah Candy, I can't just dip out on

you like that--

CANDACE

I was doing just fine before you

moved in, remember? I can handle

it.

Laura sucks her teeth.

CANDACE (CONT'D)

You working was only supposed to be

temporary. Mom would've wanted--

LAURA

Who?! Man, don't even--

CANDACE

She would've--

LAURA

Stop.

Laura pushes up from the table and glares at Candace, a

showdown. Candace stares back, unfazed. Laura caves first.

LAURA (CONT'D)

I'll get the money orders in the

morning.

Laura tugs at the envelope but Candace doesn't let go right

away.

LAURA (CONT'D)

I'll look into it alright?

Candace relinquishes the envelope and Laura stalks off down

the hallway to her room.

CANDACE

The next test is coming up soon!

22.

LAURA (O.S.)

I said I'll look into it!

MIKA'S FRIEND

FAST GIRL #2

Tamara Marks?

MIKA'S FRIEND

Heeeell no--Fat Tamara.

MIKA

Oh I was about to say, Tamara Marks

is a ughh--I can't stand her.

MIKA'S FRIEND

Anyway, it was all of us and oh

Laura, you know that girl from the

restaurant? She was there with one

of her friends.

MIKA

That gay chick? Ya'll be hanging

MIKA'S FRIEND

Yeah, well it's a couple of them.

She's mad cool though, so sometime

MIKA

Man, y'all be doin' it on it

FAST GIRL #2

I told your butt to come.

MIKA'S FRIEND

But anyway--

MIKA

Some of them AG's are kinda cute--

I'm not saying I would, but I would

holla.

FAST GIRL #2

I don't know about all that.

MIKA

Isn't that one of them over there?

What's her name? Amika?--Alisha?

The pack directs their attention at Alike. Alike profiles and

attempts to look casual.

MIKA'S FRIEND

Alike.

MIKA

Yeah, Alike--she's cute too.

FAST GIRL #2

Uugh. I don't be looking at them

all like that.

Mika smiles as her eyes travel down Alike's physique. Alike,

aware of the admiring gaze tugs and smooths at her shirt

unnecessarily. She licks her lips and readjusts the book in

her lap, fighting hard to keep the grin off her face.

MIKA

Look, I'm not gay--but if I was gay

I might talk to her.

MIKA'S FRIEND

She's in the middle anyway.

MIKA

Yeah, but if she was just a little

more harder--

Alike looks over and starts to nod when a CUTE BOY with locs

swaggers up to the girls, drawing their rapt attention.

24.

CUTE BOY

`Sup ladies?

MIKA                           FAST GIRL #2

MIKA'S FRIEND

Oooh--let me find out, Mika. You

25   EXT./INT. - RESTAURANT STOCKROOM - DAY                       25

LAURA

Watch out, it's slippery.

ALIKE

So what do you think?

LAURA

I already told you what I think.

ALIKE

But you know her, right?

LAURA

I said I know of her, I don't know

her know her.

25.

ALIKE

I'm saying, you know her friend,

right? You gonna introduce us?

LAURA

Just put those on that stack right

there. Yeah, thank you.

ALIKE

You listening?

LAURA

I'm listening--all I'm saying is--

pass me that milkshake mix right

there.

Alike tosses Laura a bladder of milkshake mix. Laura catches

it.

LAURA

All I'm saying is that I don't

think you should put yourself out

there like that. Especially if you

don't even know if she likes you

like that.

ALIKE

She does.

LAURA

How do you know she does?

ALIKE

I just know she does.

LAURA

Hmmph. We'll see.

Laura holds out her hand as if checking for rain and scans

the ceiling.

ALIKE

What're you doing?

LAURA

I thought I felt a drop of pig

shit.

ALIKE

Shut up.

26.

LAURA

All I know is I been trying to get

you to holla at girls in the club

for the longest.

ALIKE

I don't want to holla at girls in

the club.

LAURA

Obviously. Why you pressed about

this chick?

Alike shrugs.

ALIKE

I wanted to ask you about something

else too.

LAURA

Oh God, what now?

ALIKE

I need you to get something for me.

LAURA

What?!

Alike cocks her head at Laura. Laura frowns back.

LAURA

What?!

ALIKE

Just for my image.

Alike raises her eyebrow. Laura shakes her head. The light

bulb goes off. She roars in disbelief.

LAURA

WHAAAAAT???!! You trying to

strap!!?? Whaaatt?!! Oh my God,

what are you going through...

ALIKE

Please.

LAURA

What difference you think having a

bulge in your pants gon' make?

ALIKE

Pleeeeease. By next Friday.

27.

LAURA

Next Friday?! Okay-- Whatever. Oh

26   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                            26

LAURA

I think it looks natural.

LAURA

I'm serious, I mean it doesn't look

that bad.

ALIKE

I can't believe you.

LAURA

What?!

ALIKE

Laura, this doesn't look right.

I'ma look stupid.

LAURA

Well, first of all-- I don't think

its supposed to be on top of your

underwear like that.

ALIKE

I'm not putting this thing next to

my skin, it pinches already.

LAURA

It's supposed to fit like that.

ALIKE

They didn't have any brown?

28.

LAURA

I didn't have time for all of that.

The brown ones were too big,

anyway.

Alike struggling with the apparatus.   Laura smiles.

ALIKE

Ugh! You gotta take it back.

LAURA

I can't take it back.

ALIKE

Here's the receipt!

LAURA

Unh-unh. I'm not going back in

there. One time was embarrassing

enough.

ALIKE

You grown!

LAURA

Still what if somebody would see me

in there? I'm not going back,

that's it.

ALIKE

Then where's my change?

Sharonda bursts into the room.

SHARONDA

Lee, where'd you put my make-up

case...AHHH I'M GON' TELL. OOH LEE,

I'MA TELL DADDY!

Laura leaps from the bed and blocks Sharonda's path to the

doorway. Alike tackles Sharonda and wrestles her down to the

floor. Laura slams the door, shuts and locks it.

SHARONDA

Eeew get that thing, off a me! Get

it off me it's nasty! I'm tellin'!

LAURA

Shhh!!

ALIKE

Shut up!!! Thought you locked the

door?!

29.

SHARONDA

Eeew.    Get it offa me!

LAURA

I did!

ALIKE

OK, look I'm offa you.     Just be

quiet and calm down.

SHARONDA

I'm tellin' that you got that

thing.

LAURA

You can't tell.

SHARONDA

I'm telling.

ALIKE

Shut up.

SHARONDA

It looks nasty.

ALIKE

(to Laura)

See, I told you so.

SHARONDA

Where's my make up case?    I know

you got it.

ALIKE

I just borrowed it.

Alike pulls off the dildo and harness.

SHARONDA

Give it back.

Alike fishes the make-up case out of her backpack. She holds

it out to Sharonda. Sharonda reaches for it. Alike jerks it

back.

ALIKE

Promise you won't tell.

SHARONDA

Give it back.

Alike flips open the make up case and jabs the dildo at it,

stopping short of the surface of the make up.

30.

SHARONDA

LEE, STOP IT EEEW!!! I just got

that one.

LAURA

Shhh!!

SHARONDA

Don't touch it with that... eeww

that's so nasty. C'mon Lee give it

back.

LAURA

Then promise you won't tell.

ALIKE

Promise...

SHARONDA

Ughh, I hate you.

Alike jabs the dildo closer to the make-up.

SHARONDA

OK, OK I won't tell.   Daag!

Alike tosses the case at Sharonda who scrambles to catch it.

Alike wraps the dildo back up in the bag and hides it behind

her headboard. Sharonda saunters out into the hallway.

SHARONDA

I'm still tellin'

AUDREY

Tellin' what?

Audrey peers into the bedroom from the hallway, still dressed

for work, shoulder stooped from the weight of her tote bag.

ALIKE                           SHARONDA

Noth--                           She took my makeup again.

AUDREY

Lee...

(notices Laura)

Oh. Hello Laura, I didn't see you

standing there.

LAURA

Hi Mrs. Freeman.

AUDREY

How's your mother?

31.

LAURA

I haven't spoken to her in awhile.

She's fine.

AUDREY

Well I hope so. And I'm so glad to

hear your sisters finally getting

back on her feet. Wasn't she--

LAURA

She's good.

ALIKE

Mom?!

AUDREY

I think we'll just leave this open.

Let some air circulate in here.

LAURA

I was just about to leave, anyway.

So...

LAURA

Just try it.

27   INT. NIGHTCLUB COUCH - EVENING                               27

LAURA

LAURA

Sit still, people gon' think you

ALIKE

This joint hurts, man. I'ma go take

LAURA

You not gon' take it off.

ALIKE

I'm gonna take it off.

LAURA

Where you gonna take it off at?

ALIKE

In the bathroom.

LAURA

Then where you gon' put it? You

dick in your hand? Chill. I knew we

shouldn't have done this. You

ALIKE

Then I'm out.

LAURA

Nah, you're `bout to stay and go

wanted to meet her, not me.

ALIKE

Then you come on, too. Hurry up--

28   INT. NIGHTCLUB COUCH - LATER                              28

MIKA

You alright?

33.

ALIKE

Yeah, no, yeah it's just--there's a

spring in the cushion or something.

MIKA

You wanna switch seats?

ALIKE

No, I'm good.

MIKA

And you don't wanna dance?

LAURA

Hey ya'll we're about to go dance!

ALIKE

No, no not really. I'm not really

feeling the music.

MIKA

Well you don't mind right? I mean

you don't mind if I go dance with

somebody else?

ALIKE

No, do your thing.

MIKA

If you change your mind--

ALIKE

No, no it's cool.

29   INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               29

AUDREY

ALIKE

It won't happen--

AUDREY

Oh I know it won't.

Turn that mess off!!

AUDREY (O.S.)

Sharonda?! Sharonda are you ready?!

Stop lollygagging!

SHARONDA (O.S.)

I'm coming!

AUDREY

Lee are you ready?! Lee?!

AUDREY (CONT'D)

I said off. Thought you were ready?

35.

ALIKE

I am ready.

AUDREY

You're not going to church looking

like that. Where's the blouse I

bought you?

ALIKE

What's wrong with this?

33   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                         33

AUDREY

Hey there, you're home early--well

actually late. I thought you would

have called--

ALIKE

Dad--

ARTHUR

Do what your mom says.

AUDREY

Are you hungry? Let me heat it up

for you.

AUDREY (CONT'D)

I'll heat it up on the stove for

you. Tastes better.

ALIKE

Dad--

AUDREY

Lee!

36.

ARTHUR

Leave me out of it.

AUDREY

Go get changed.

ALIKE

Dad, what's wrong with this outfit?

ARTHUR

Nothing.

ALIKE

See?

AUDREY

I'm not gonna argue with you.

ARTHUR

Do what she says.

ALIKE

Dad--

ARTHUR

(speaking bad Tarzan

Swahili)

Umgowa!

AUDREY

And put on a skirt!

Alike stalks off to her bedroom. Sharonda bounces into the

kitchen.

SHARONDA

Hey Dad!

AUDREY

Too much lipstick.

SHARONDA

It's lipgloss.

Audrey wheels on Sharonda with a death glare.

SHARONDA (CONT'D)

Okay, okay.

ARTHUR

Gimmie kiss.

Sharonda pecks dad on the cheek. Dad wipes his cheek and rubs

his fingers together.

37.

Sharonda giggles and bounds back into her bedroom. Audrey

slides a steaming plate in front of Arthur.

AUDREY

Did you talk to her?

ARTHUR

Get me a beer, please. Sharonda's

fine.

AUDREY

I'm talking about Lee.

ARTHUR

Alike. And I don't see that there's

a problem.

AUDREY

I'm tired of this tomboy thing

she's got going on. And Laura. You

said you were going to handle it.

ARTHUR

Umm-hmm.

AUDREY

She needs a male point of view.

ARTHUR

I said okay, dammit! Now can I

please have a beer please?

AUDREY

It's Sunday morning.

ARTHUR

It goes with the spaghetti.

Audrey lifts a beer out of the fridge and slides it in front

of Arthur. She pulls up a chair as he plows through the meal,

her expression softening as she caresses his forearm.

AUDREY

Do you have to work tonight?

ARTHUR

To put food on the table and

clothes on our backs, no. To go out

to restaurants and keep designer

sneakers in the closet, yes.

AUDREY

Are you forever gonna be mad?

38.

ARTHUR

Are you forever going to be happy?

(beat)

You made that decision a long time

ago.

AUDREY

We both made sacrifices.

Alike stomps back into the kitchen wearing the pink v-neck

that Audrey bought her and an unflattering pleat-front skirt.

Arthur stifles a giggle behind his beer can.

ARTHUR

You look beautiful, baby.

AUDREY

Tuck your blouse in.

ALIKE

This isn't me.

AUDREY

Tuck your blouse in.

ARTHUR

Leave it out.

Audrey frowns at Arthur. Arthur stands his ground.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

I think it's fine out. What's the

deal with you and Laura?

ALIKE

What deal?

AUDREY

Comin' in late...

ALIKE

Dad, I hardly ever--

ARTHUR

Why don't you give that a break for

a little while?

ALIKE

Dad, come on...

AUDREY

(to Alike)

You heard him!

(MORE)

39.

(to Sharonda)

Sharonda! You done?!

SHARONDA (O.S.)

Coming!

AUDREY

You coming with us?

ARTHUR

Nope. Sleep.

AUDREY

We could go to a later service. The

one o'clock--

ARTHUR

I said NO!!

SHARONDA

I'm ready.

ARTHUR

Alike, you look beautiful.

Everybody looks beautiful, okay?

34   EXT. CHURCH - DAY                                            34

AUDREY

Lee! Lee! Here's someone I want you

to meet.

40.

ALIKE

Huh?

Audrey motions to Bina standing by with her mother, Ms.

Singletary. Alike cracks the window a little wider and

acknowledges them with a half-hearted wave.

ALIKE (CONT'D)

Oh. Hey.

AUDREY

Get down out the car and come

speak.

Laboriously, Alike rolls the window back up, turns off the

car radio, and climbs down out of the car.

AUDREY (CONT'D)

What's wrong with you?

ALIKE

Alright, Mom.

AUDREY

You'll have to excuse her, she's

been feeling rude lately.

MRS. SINGLETARY

Oh don't worry, Audrey, I

understand how it is. Hormones.

It's just a phase.

AUDREY

Alike, this is Mrs. Singletary, one

of my co-workers and her daughter,

Bina. Sylvia, Bina, this is my

daughter Alike, we call her "Lee"

for short.

Alike shakes both of their hands in turn.

ALIKE

Hi.

MRS. SINGLETARY

Hello.

ALIKE

Nice to meet you.

BINA

Hi.

41.

AUDREY

And this is my youngest daughter,

Sharonda.

SHARONDA

Hi.

BINA

Hi.

MRS. SINGLETARY

Hi there, nice to meet you.

AUDREY

Lee, Bina goes to the same school

as you.

ALIKE

Cool.

BINA

Yeah, I think I've seen you around.

Mrs. Alvarado's class right? AP

English?

ALIKE

Yup.

Audrey looks pleased with herself. Alike squirms.

AUDREY

So. Now that we're all acquainted,

don't be a stranger.

MRS. SINGLETARY

Oh no, we won't.

AUDREY

Bina I think you and Lee may even

go to school the same way. Don't

you live off of St. James Place?

MRS. SINGLETARY

There is something to be said for

safety in numbers.

Bina nods. Alike squirms.

MRS. SINGLETARY (CONT'D)

Well, we need to be pushing off --

I'll call you about those VBS

workbooks.

42.

AUDREY

Alrighty, I'll be around. Take

care.

35   INT. FAMILY CAR - CONTINUOUS                                35

ALIKE

You're funny.

AUDREY

I don't know what your problem is.

SHARONDA

Can somebody put in this CD please?

ALIKE

I don't know what you think is

going to change.

AUDREY

I know God doesn't make mistakes. I

know that much.

AUDREY (CONT'D)

You may not like Bina, but you're

certainly gonna be spending much

less time with that Laura person, I

guarantee you that much.

SHARONDA

Moooom, can you--

AUDREY

Be quiet. Nobody's putting in

anything. I'm gonna listen to what

I want to listen to for a change.

43.

36   EXT. STREET - DAY                                          36

BINA

Look, I don't like lying to my

mother, that's all.

ALIKE

Then don't, she doesn't have to

know.

BINA

She does.    She asks me everyday.

ALIKE

So tell her yeah.

BINA

No, I'm sick of lying to cover for

you.

ALIKE

So don't.

BINA

Look Alike, Lee. Whatever it is you

wanna be called. I'm not trying to

hang out with you, either, but I'm

not about to take an L for it. So

stop dodging me, let's just go to

school together and be done with

it. We don't have to see each

other any other time than that.

BINA (CONT'D)

Whatever, my mother asks me again,

I'm telling her. Then she can tell

your mother, then it's whatever for

you.

ALIKE

Hey!

44.

ALIKE (CONT'D)

Hey!

Alike checks for traffic then dashes across the street to

catch up with her.

ALIKE (CONT'D)

Hey look, I'm sorry.

BINA

Yeah, you sorry your mom is gonna

bug out.

ALIKE

No for real, I'm sorry. I didn't

mean to be that way. It's just...

OK, I am concerned that my, my mom

will find out, but...

BINA

But?

ALIKE

It's not like that. It's just--

she's just. If you knew her, you'd

understand. She's like, I don't

know.

The girls walk in silence for a moment.

ALIKE (CONT'D)

So what's your favorite class?

BINA

You don't have to make small talk.

Let's just walk.

ALIKE

I said I'm sorry. It's not you,

it's just that my mom is like,

she's like...

BINA

Overprotective?

Alike relaxes her shoulders, both relieved and surprised.

ALIKE

Yeah.

BINA

I can tell. I've seen--I mean, a

lot of people's parents are like

that.

45.

ALIKE

Yeah?

BINA

Yeah.

ALIKE

Yeah. But probably not like mine.

But anyway...

BINA

Anyway, like I said, we don't have

to talk. Just walk.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

That's just embarrassing!

ALIKE

You ain't got no range, either.

ARTHUR

Yeah but at least I hit the

backboard. Damn.

ALIKE

Brick!!

ARTHUR

What's the score?

ALIKE

One up.

ARTHUR

One?

ALIKE

Yup!

ARTHUR

One? Nah, I definitely have like

three. At least three.

39   INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT                                    39

47.

MACK

It's on again... Check it out Free.

Channel 5 and Channel 2.

Arthur appears on the TV screen, dressed in suit, tie,

sunglasses and looking impressive. He is talking to a news

reporter and a bad news graphic reading "East Side Drug Bust--

Detective Arthur Freeman" blots out the bottom of the screen.

SOCK

Look who's big time.

MACK

Brother was looking clean though.

Looked just like, look like...uh--

Danny Glover!

Arthur and Mack laugh and slap hands. Sock sneers at their

revelry.

The bell over the door tinkles and a heavyset BUTCH WOMAN

strolls in. Her head is shaved and a thick wallet chain

clinks against her ample carpenter pants. All three men turn

to stare.

MACK (CONT'D)

Been more of that since they opened

up that new club `cross the way.

Arthur grunts and returns to his paper.

SOCK

(to Butch Woman)

Excuse me Miss??!! Miiiiissss??!!

MACK

Certain Friday nights they got, you

know special parties going on.

SOCK

Or should I say Sir??!! Siiiir??!!

Hello?!!

ARTHUR

Chill out, Sock.

SOCK

Hey, my man! You hear me talkin' to

you?!

Mack snatches Sock's cup. Sock pivots around to protest.

SOCK

Hey!!

48.

MACK

Mind your business.

Sock yanks his cup back and turns to resume his taunts. He's

caught off guard and stumbles backward as the woman pushes up

to the counter with a case of liquor. Arthur steps out of the

way and observes.

BUTCH WOMAN

And a pack of Kools.

Mack nods and fishes under the counter.

SOCK

Say, I been trying to get your

attention. Do you go by Sir or

Miss?

MACK

That'll be all ma'am?

BUTCH WOMAN

Yeah.

SOCK

Look I just had a simple question I

wanted to ask. See, I just want to

know how does pussy taste?

The woman directs her full attention at Sock for the first

time. Mack watches as he quickly punches in the sale. Arthur

stiffens.

SOCK (CONT'D)

You know, I just wanna know if you

go with women for the taste, or is

it just you're too big, black, and

ugly so don't no man want you?

Sock laughs at his own nasty joke and takes a sip from his

cup.

MACK

$65.07 ma'am.

The woman counts out the money and smiles at Sock.

BUTCH WOMAN

I can't lie, pussy do taste good.

SOCK

Oh yeah?

The woman takes her time putting away her change.

49.

BUTCH WOMAN (CONT'D)

Maybe you should try it yourself

sometime. Or better yet--

The woman picks up her case.

BUTCH WOMAN (CONT'D)

--ask yo' wife how she likes me!

The woman winks at Sock. Arthur chokes back a guffaw. As soon

as the woman clears the door, Arthur and Mack explode in

laughter. Sock is livid and screams after her.

SOCK

Fuckin' Bulldagger! He-She! Dyke!

MACK

Ask your wife!

ARTHUR

She told you.

SOCK

She ain't tell me shit! I don't

know what the fuck y'all niggas are

laughing for!

MACK

Awww shut up. Your big mouth got

you in trouble as usual.

SOCK

Thought you was my friend, Mack.

But I guess I ain't expect you to

defend me Free, the way your

daughter is--

Arthur slams Sock against the counter before he can finish

his sentence.

ARTHUR

Say what?!

MACK

He don't mean nothin'! He don't

know what he's talking about!

Arthur grinds Sock's collar tighter around his trembling

fist. Sock glares back, clearly punked.

MACK (CONT'D)

He ain't moved outside a two-mile

radius of where he crawled out his

mammy's pussy. He don't know shit.

50.

SOCK

(to MACK)

I been to Poughkeepsie!

MACK

Carry your Poughkeepsie ass on out

of my store!

SOCK

Fuck y'all!

ARTHUR

I should arrest your ass.

SOCK

Man, fuck y'all!!

MACK

Free, don't pay him no mind. Just

talkin' trash.

LAURA

Damn, this is your color. So what's

the deal incog-negro?

ALIKE

Mom has me hemmed up.

51.

LAURA

Your phone ain't broke. You coulda

called a nigga. Put this on.

Laura pulls away the orange polo shirt and hands Alike a

turquoise one instead. Alike hoists the oversized shirt over

her head.

ALIKE

My bad. She's making me hang out

with this chick from church. It's

crazy.

LAURA

Makin' you?! You a grown-ass woman,

bruh!

Laura shakes her head as she plucks a brand new baseball cap

from the wall rack and drops it onto Alike's head. Alike

considers and takes it off. Laura puts another cap in its

place. Before Alike can object, Laura tosses her a pair of

denim shorts.

LAURA (CONT'D)

Try these with it. So I guess the

piers is out for Saturday, huh?

ALIKE

I don't even know if that's me

anymore.

Alike struggles into the jean shorts, widening her stance so

they don't fall down. Laura tosses her a belt and admires

Alike's reflection.

LAURA

Yeah, that's hot, yo. You should

rock that.

ALIKE (CONT'D)

I was gonna see if you wanna do

something different?

Alike strips off the baseball cap and hangs it back on the

rack.

LAURA

Different like what?

Alike peels out of the polo shirt.

ALIKE

I don't know--maybe like a open mic

or something.

52.

LAURA

Open mic? Nah, man. It's plenty

chicks at the piers, you just gotta

be more confident.

LAURA (CONT'D)

You can rock this. I haven't even

worn it yet. But I understand if

you got better things to do.

ALIKE

Nah, I'm down.

LAURA

You sure? I don't want you getting

hemmed up.

ALIKE

Nah seriously, I'm down for

whatever.

LAURA

Real?

ALIKE

Promise.

LAURA

That's what's up! I'ma take the

whole day off. It's gonna be tight

watch... we gon' do it up!

AUDREY

Your father likes it up.

ALIKE

It looks nice down.

AUDREY

Maybe. Anyway give this back to

Bina's mom when you go over

tomorrow night.

ALIKE

Saturday night?!

AUDREY

We talked about this.

ALIKE

No we didn't.

AUDREY

Lee--

ALIKE

I had plans for this weekend.

AUDREY

Well, you don't have to go to

Bina's on Saturday night, you can

always stay home with me.

ALIKE

Oh my God!

43   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - EVENING                                43

BINA

You like Destiny's Child?

ALIKE

Uhh-uhh.

54.

BINA

Jay-Z?

ALIKE

Nope.

BINA

Fifty?

ALIKE

No, I don't really like any of that

commercial bullshit.

Bina looks up, off balanced.

BINA

Oh. Who do you like?

Alike checks the time on her phone.

ALIKE

Shit!

Alike starts packing her backpack.

ALIKE (CONT'D)

Just more underground stuff. None

of that crap they play on the

radio.

BINA

Like who?

ALIKE

People you probably haven't heard

of. Conscious stuff.

BINA

Like who?

ALIKE

Roots. Black Star. Asheru and Blue

Black. Pharcyde.

BINA

Pharcyde? I heard of Pharcyde.

ALIKE

Ah--for real?

BINA

Yep. Tribe? J-Rawls? Bahamadia?

55.

Alike perks up, looking genuinely interested for the first

time.

ALIKE

Uh-oh, whatchu know about

Bahamadia? Let me find out....

BINA

I'm not as generic as you think.

The phone rings. Mrs. Singletary answers from another room.

Alike and Bina freeze, listening.

MRS. SINGLETARY (O.S.)

Hello? Hi Audrey. Yes. Yeah she's

here. I understand--

Alike sulks. Bina flips to the back of the CD book.

BINA

Alright, how about Rock?

ALIKE

It's cool.

BINA

Whatchu know about Santogold? Since

you all underground and stuff.

ALIKE

She's tight.

BINA

Tamar-kali?

ALIKE

I haven't heard of her, I heard of

Res.

Alike hoists the backpack onto her shoulder and stands to

leave.

BINA

Oh no this is way better, you gotta

check her out.

Bina jams her iPod onto the stereo adapter. The thick, fierce

guitar rhythms of Tamar-kali's "Boot" consume the room. Bina

chants the lyrics along with the music.

BINA (CONT'D)

"Her hair is short. Her legs are

brown. Her lips are full. Her head

hangs down."

56.

She's out with her friend right

LAURA

Oh. Umm do you know when she'll be

I'll cover. It's cool.

ALIKE

Nah, I wanna stay.

BINA

Oh hell, no. That's for old people--

I'll write down some places you

read some of my stuff, too.

Definitely.

ALIKE

A butterfly, briefly

Suffocated

On the mucous of its own change

Imprisoned

(MORE)

59.

By the membranous chaff of its own

underdeveloped

Wings

And

Cramped

In the darkness of the too-tight

cocoon of its own creation

Pauses

Thinking death inevitable

Prepares to die in the absolute

solitude

Of Swollen Husk.

A c r a c k appears

A thin jagged light connecting

The inner to the outer world

A butterfly, briefly

Paralyzed by the imminence of death

Discovers life is possible.

MRS. ALVARADO

what you think.

ALIKE

I liked your story, though. It was

tight.

BINA

Yeah? Which one? The one about the--

ALIKE

The one about karma, how things

come back to you. That one, I

thought it was tight.

BINA

For real? Thanks. I wasn't gonna

say anything, but I liked yours

too.

ALIKE

Why?

60.

BINA

Why did I like it or why wasn't I

gonna say anything?

ALIKE

Why did you like it?

BINA

I don't know. I guess because it

felt honest.

ALIKE

Oh.

BINA

Didn't you have on a different

shirt earlier?

ALIKE

What?

BINA

Nothin'.

ALIKE

No, what'd you say?

BINA

Nothin'.

ALIKE

Yeah, I had on a different shirt.

BINA

Oh... Well, that's cool.

ALIKE

So why weren't you gonna say

anything about it?

BINA

About your shirt?

ALIKE

About the poem.

BINA

Cause you're moody.

ALIKE

Moody?

BINA

And quiet.

61.

ALIKE

Man, I'm not moody.

BINA

Yeah, right.

ALIKE

What?

BINA

This is me.

BINA (CONT'D)

It's not so bad when there's some

conversation, huh?

BINA (CONT'D)

You wanna come up?

51   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                             51

ALIKE

Who gave you this?

BINA

What the bear? My dad.

ALIKE

No, this.

BINA

Oh that. Girl, my stupid ex-

boyfriend gave me that.

ALIKE

Oh. Cute.

62.

BINA

Not really. I mean I guess it was

at the time.

Bina lobs the little army man into a trash can across the

room and hands Alike the booklet.

BINA (CONT'D)

Anyway, this is the other artist I

was telling you about. Her stuff is

like, bouncier.

A buoyant Afropunk beat wafts through the bedroom. Bina plops

down on the bed next to Alike.

ALIKE

This is straight. You'll burn me a

copy?

BINA

Yeah, I have a bunch of other

stuff, too.

(beat)

So who do you hang out with? I

don't really see you with anybody.

Alike shrugs and rifles through her backpack. She pulls out

her composition book. Awkward silence.

BINA (CONT'D)

I didn't mean it like that. I was

just asking because I was curious.

I don't really like anybody that

goes there either.

ALIKE

My friend Laura used to go there.

Not now, but she's going back.

BINA

Oh because, I was just gonna say--

I'm going to this house party and

you can come if you want to.

Bina waves her hand at the radio.

BINA (CONT'D)

They play this kind of music.

ALIKE

Sure. How'm I supposed to dress?

63.

BINA

You don't dress. You just come

however. Come as you are.

Alike nods.

BINA (CONT'D)

Can I see?

Bina snatches the book from Alike's hands and starts flipping

through pages before Alike can answer.

ALIKE

Yeah...But that's mainly old stuff,

though.

BINA

This is the one you did today?

ALIKE

Yeah.

BINA

Nice.

Bina offers the journal back to Alike. Alike reaches for it.

Bina pulls it away at the last second--an impromptu game of

keep away.

BINA (CONT'D)

Take it.

Alike misses again. The girls crack up.

BINA (CONT'D)

Sorry, here.

Bina yanks it away again. Alike gives up, still smiling.

ALIKE

You play too much.

BINA

Seriously, it's right here.     Just

take it.

Alike summons the courage for one last swipe. She manages to

grab it but Bina doesn't let go right away. The girls lock

eyes during the extemporaneous tug-of-war.

ALIKE

Thank you...

64.

BINA

You're welcome...

BINA (CONT'D)

Mmmwaahhh!

BINA (CONT'D)

What's so private?

ALIKE

Nothin', just my writings...

ALIKE (CONT'D)

Why'd you do that for?

BINA

Sorry---

ALIKE

No, I'm sorry. I just umm...I gotta

go.

BINA

I thought--

ALIKE

Sorry.

65.

LAURA

You'll get that for me?

One of the friends breaks away from the pack, opens the door

without greeting and walks away. Alike is left alone to

escort herself in. Laura hardly looks up as Alike stops at

the fringes of the pack.

ALIKE

Wassup man.

A collective grumble of greeting goes up around the table

although no one addresses Alike directly. Laura slams the

table and raises her hands in triumph.

LAURA

Board, goddammit!! I told you!

PIER GIRL #1

Awww, we shoulda been done set you!

Laura slaps hands with her partner. The unlucky pair of

partners argue. The personal cheerleader kisses Laura on the

neck. Alike looks away.

PERSONAL CHEERLEADER

Good game, baby!

LAURA

What's good, Lee?

ALIKE

Just came to say wassup.

LAURA

Whatchu got, Ty?

PIER GIRL #2

Three, maybe four.

LAURA

We goin' eight!!

Roars of disbelief from around the table. Alike is quickly

forgotten in the ruckus. Alike circles to Laura's side. The

personal cheerleader looks her up and down.

ALIKE

Can I talk to you for a second?

LAURA

Now I got to cut you!! Grab `em

partner. We gonna run a Boston on

that ass!

(MORE)

66.

(to Alike)

Yo, I'm busy right now.

Hey, I'll talk to you later,

alright? My daughter's up.

ALIKE

Who was that?

ARTHUR

What you doing up?

ALIKE

Just wanted to talk.

ALIKE (CONT'D)

Dad, the plate--don't trash the

plate.

68.

Alike rescues the plate from the garbage and carefully lays

it in the sink so it doesn't clatter.

ALIKE (CONT'D)

Aren't you hungry?

ARTHUR

Ate already.

ALIKE

You ate at work?

ARTHUR

No, just grabbed some take out.

ALIKE

Oh. Where?

Arthur explodes.

ARTHUR

Why you asking me all these goddamn

questions, girl? What's wrong with

you? You don't question me.

ALIKE

Sorry.

Alike starts to head back to her room.

ARTHUR

Hold up. I'm sorry, Alike come on

back. Look-- I got patties...

Arthur tosses a greasy bag onto the table and pulls out a

chair for her.

ALIKE

Beef?

ARTHUR

And chicken. C'mon.

Alike sits happily and the two munch in silence for awhile.

ARTHUR

Listen uh...Your momma's worried

that uh...How's school? Straight

A's?

ALIKE

Probably.

69.

ARTHUR

That's right. Want a sip?

Arthur offers her the beer. Alike takes it to the head.

ARTHUR

I said a sip. A sip!

Arthur snatches the beer from her. They laugh. Alike picks at

her patty, eating little pieces of crust.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

What's on you your mind?

ALIKE

Nothin'.

Arthur snorts.

ALIKE (CONT'D)

What if--what if...say somebody

liked you right?

ARTHUR

They like you? Or they like you,

like you?

ALIKE

Say they like you, like you.

ARTHUR

Uh-huh.

ALIKE

I mean, they haven't said anything

yet. But what if... so what if the

person is kinda like a friend, but

you know they like you more than

that?

ARTHUR

Well, I think that's the best way

to start--as friends.

ALIKE

But then what if...What if the

person is --

Arthur scents the heavy news packed in Alike's expressive

pause and scrambles to intercept her at the pass.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

What's his name? What grade is he

in?

(MORE)

70.

I'ma look his ass up in the system.

Ha-ha! Wait `till your mama finds

out. She'll be so goddamn happy.

Alike plays along, swallowing her disappointment.

ALIKE

Yeah.

Arthur pushes back from the table and pulls a fresh police

uniform out the hall closet. He lays it across the back of

the couch and unzips his pants. Alike turns her back to give

him privacy.

ARTHUR

Say uh--there's this new--uh

women's club up there by the liquor

store--have you--do you--you

haven't heard anything about it,

right?

Alike shakes her head no. Arthur tucks his undershirt into

his pants.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Called the Kitty Litter, the

Catbox, something like that?

ALIKE

Nah, I never even heard of it.

ARTHUR

Good. `Cause you know that's a

uh...it's a rough neighborhood. You

know that right? I had a case over

there. You wanna be careful--stay

away from that element. Just in

case it ever comes up?

ALIKE

I'll be careful.

ARTHUR

Good. I know you will.

Alike glances back at Arthur and sees that he's decent. She

scoots back around to face him. Arthur smooths his uniform

shirt into his pants.

ALIKE

Dad, when you were on the phone

earlier? It sounded like...I

mean...I guess you're headed back

to work, huh?

71.

ARTHUR

Yep. Your mama still up?

ALIKE

Probably.

Tell her I had to work.

A long awkward silence. Alike leans against the bank of

lockers, not daring to make eye contact.

ALIKE

I'm sorry about the other day.

BINA

It's cool.

Bina pretends to rearrange books in her locker.

ALIKE (CONT'D)

Things have been crazy. But look,

I'm sorry I bugged out. It's

just...I didn't know that you...I

wasn't expecting that.

BINA

You still coming to the party?

ALIKE

I don't know--I need to try and

catch up with Laura.

BINA

Oh.

Arthur slips in and lays his holster on an armchair, not even

bothering to approach Audrey's sleeping form.

Arthur peeks inside the fridge and inspects one of Audrey's

foil covered plates. He tosses it aside and gathers sandwich

ingredients instead. Audrey yawns and props herself up on one

elbow.

AUDREY

Oh you're home?

ARTHUR

Hey.

AUDREY

I must've dozed off. How long have

you been in?

ARTHUR

Hour.

Dad takes a bite of his sandwich and shoves the ingredients

back into the fridge.

AUDREY

Did you see the plate in there?

ARTHUR

This is fine.

Arthur plops down on an armchair and flips the TV channel to

sports highlights. Mom scoots over on the couch.

AUDREY

There's room over here. You can see

the TV better.

ARTHUR

This is fine.

Arthur props his feet up on the coffee table and catches

Audrey's hurt expression. He winks at her.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Thank you.

AUDREY

Just alike.

ARTHUR

Say what?

76.

AUDREY

You and your daughter. Have you

talked to Lee yet? I told you she--

ARTHUR

I talked to Alike.

AUDREY

You did?

ARTHUR

Everything's fine. Like I told you.

Matter fact, she's got a boyfriend.

AUDREY

Boyfriend?

ARTHUR

Just give her some space.

AUDREY

Space? She's hardly ever home in

the first place and you're just

like her, creeping in all hours of

the night. Both of you. Running

around like you got something to

hide, like I'm the big, bad witch

and what about me? I'm home by

myself all the time and Sharonda's

getting older and starting to go

out and pretty soon--

ARTHUR

I don't have anything to hide. Look

I told you I talked to Alike and

everything is fine.

AUDREY

Did you ask her?

Dad slams down his half-eaten sandwich and stands up.

ARTHUR

No, because I didn't have to.

Besides,I would know okay? If

anybody would know, it would be me.

I know my daughter--

to see you're finally happy.

C'mon man, you know you're my best

LAURA

You don't need to say anything. I

just wanted to get it off my chest.

I'm happy for you, that's all.

Alike shakes her head. Her mouth moves but nothing comes out.

LAURA (CONT'D)

Because I love you, alright? And

I'm sayin'...I'm right here.

Alike is stopped cold, as the light bulb finally goes off.

Laura takes a long drag on the joint. Bina and Mika stumble

over giggling. Bina hooks Alike's arm. Mika kisses Laura on

the neck. Laura snaps out of her gaze, her familiar smirk

creeping back.

MIKA

We goin' to get something to eat?

That's what's up.

Laura's mother frowns up and down the block before refocusing

on Laura. Laura takes a step closer to the door.

LAURA (CONT'D)

Me and Candy, you know we're doing

real good.

Laura's mother puts her hand on the doorknob.

LAURA (CONT'D)

We might even be moving to a bigger

place soon. You know she's workin'

at the hospital now, yeah you'd be

real proud of her. She might even

go back and get her RN--

Laura takes another step forward.

LAURA (CONT'D)

You look healthy, yeah you look

real good. You know uh, we miss you

Laura's mother starts to close the door. Laura backs away.

Laura fishes the stiff envelope out of her pocket and

advances on the screen door again, holding it out.

LAURA (CONT'D)

So, I did it. I took the test and--

Laura's mother slams the door. Laura stands on her tiptoes

and yells at the diamond shaped window.

LAURA (CONT'D)

I got my GED!

The lock on the door snaps into place. Renewed barking from

across the street. Silence from the door. Laura brushes a

fist across her eyes and stuffs the envelope into the

mailbox.

ALIKE

Look um--I just wanted to say that

last night...last night was

amazing...thank you for--

BINA

Last night we were just playin'

around, that's all.

Bina flinches away from Alike's touch. Alike shoots a glance

at the door and drops her voice to a choked whisper.

ALIKE

Look... We can slow things down...

Nobody has to know that we're

together.

BINA

"Together"? Whoa, no...

ALIKE

Huh?! I thought... Look if you

don't want to call it that, that's

fine, but don't act like nothing

happened.

Bina moves away and levels her gaze at Alike for the first

time. Alike touches Bina's elbow, Bina flinches away.

BINA

Look, I'm not gay okay? This isn't

me--I wasn't--I'm not ready for all

this...

Alike recruits the discarded stuffed moose and dances it

around on the bed. Bina recoils and snatches it away.

Recognition seeps across Alike's pained face. Bina moves away

from the bed and turns her back on Alike.

Alike finds her pajama pants on the floor and yanks them on.

She pulls on jeans over her pajama bottoms and hauls a

sweatshirt down over her nightie. She flings her backpack

open on the bed and hunts around the room wildly gathering

her things. Alike goes in the bathroom and reappears with an

armful of toiletries, dumping them in the bag. Bina watches

her, arms folded. Alike takes one last look around the room

and heads for the door, running a sleeve across her face.

BINA (CONT'D)

Lee?

Alike ignores her and launches into the hallway.   Bina runs

to her bedroom doorway.

AUDREY

No, you come tell your father what

ARTHUR

Don't drag her into this, Audrey!

(to Alike)

Go to your room, Alike. Your mom

and I are having a discussion.

AUDREY

We are not discussing!! I wanna

ARTHUR

ARTHUR

AUDREY

Sharonda, wake up!! Come see your

father leaving us!!

ARTHUR

I'm not fucking leaving!! Will you

stop saying that?!

AUDREY

Audrey shoves Arthur toward the door. Reflexively, Arthur

raises his hand at Audrey. Audrey puffs up.

AUDREY (CONT'D)

Oh, what?! I wish you would!! Go

ahead!! Look girls, your daddy's

going to beat me!!

Sharonda bursts into tears behind Alike. Alike hurries

Sharonda back down the hallway.

89.

ALIKE

Shhh. It's okay. Go in my room and

lock the door. Don't come out,

`kay?

ALIKE (CONT'D)

It's gonna be okay.

75   INT. ALIKE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                     75

ARTHUR (O.S.)

No! Dammit, that's not true! Look,

will you stop sayin' that?!

AUDREY (O.S.)

It's the truth!!

AUDREY (CONT'D)

Your daddy's got a new girlfriend!

Or did you already know that?! You

ARTHUR

Audrey, stop it!! Alike go back to

AUDREY

Meanwhile, your daughter's turning

into a damn man right before your

ARTHUR

No you take that back.! You shut

ALIKE

ALIKE

girlfriend--

ALIKE

Laura's NOT my girlfriend!!

ARTHUR

What the hell are you talking

about?! You don't know what the

hell are you talking about. Alike,

please just go to your room, baby!

Alike drops her gaze and backs away.

AUDREY

Tell him!

Arthur's expression cracks and he tears his focus from Audrey

to Alike.

ARTHUR

Tell me what?!

ALIKE

I'm not tellin' you nothin'.

AUDREY

Tell him you're a dyke! You tell

him you're a nasty ass dyke!!

ARTHUR

No she's not gay. Alike we didn't

raise you that way, baby.

Eyes still downcast, Alike just shakes her head and backs

away.

AUDREY

There!! You see!!

91.

ARTHUR

You shut the hell up Audrey!!

Arthur extends his arms toward Alike, his voice trembling.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

I know that's not true. You tell

your mother right now, Alike. You

tell her it isn't true!!

Alike meets her father's eyes.

ALIKE

Dad--

ARTHUR

Don't you lie now, you tell the

truth!!

ALIKE

You already know.

ARTHUR

No, I don't know. You tell your

mother it's just a phase.

ALIKE

It's not a phase!

Arthur is stopped cold, his shoulders slump.

AUDREY

See, if you would've DONE

SOMETHING!!

ARTHUR

(to Alike)

What's wrong with you?

ALIKE

There's nothing wrong with me!

AUDREY

This is your fault!! If you had--

Arthur tears into Audrey, spittle flying.

ARTHUR

AUDREY WILL YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!

92.

AUDREY                          ARTHUR

DON'T YOU SCREAM AT ME!! You    This is NOT my fault!! Just

should've been at home more     shut up and lemme talk! I'm

often!! Why don't you DO        trying to fuckin' talk--

SOMETHING!!!

ALIKE

YEAH I'M GAY!!

Arthur spasms as though he's been stabbed. Out of nowhere,

Audrey's backhand pistons Alike to the ground. She raises her

hand high and slaps it down hard on Alike's shoulders and

arms. Alike yells. Arthur turns to stone.

AUDREY

Say it again! Say it again!

Alike fends off Audrey's blows with her hands. She kicks

angrily as Audrey towers over her.

ALIKE

I'm a lesbian! Yeah, I'm a dyke.

AUDREY

No you're not!!!!!

Audrey's blows become more manic and vicious. Arthur wakes

from his trance and tries to wrestle Audrey off of Alike.

ARTHUR

That's enough! Stop it!

AUDREY

Don't you say that! Let go! Don't

you say that!

ALIKE

Get offa me!!

AUDREY

What? You a man now? YOU GON' FIGHT

ME LIKE A MAN??!!

Audrey swings and hits Alike with a nasty hook to the jaw,

Alike's head snaps back and hits the floor.

ARTHUR

AUDREY STOP!!!!

Arthur yanks Audrey off of Alike. Audrey directs her rage at

him, pummeling his face and chest.

93.

AUDREY

AND YOU TOO! YOU TOO! YOU TOO! OH

GOD!!

AUDREY (CONT'D)

YOU SAY IT'S NOT TRUE!!!

97.

ALIKE

Where's Mom?

ARTHUR

She...your mother couldn't make it.

Alike shakes her head and peers into the rusty skyline.

Arthur slumps his hands in his pockets and edges closer.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Remember our old place? Waaay out

in Queens? It was our first

apartment, we were so proud. Had

all those trees around it? In

October, the whooole block would be

covered with leaves. You remember.

Alike makes no sign.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

You couldnt've been more than 2

years old. And when the wind would

blow, all those leaves would come

rushing down the street at us and

you thought they were alive. You'd

get so scared. You'd cry and you'd

scream and beg for us to pick you

up. I would try and tell you

"they're only leaves, baby" and

make you stay on the ground. But

you were so afraid and you cried so

hard, your mother would always pick

you up. She always picked you up.

Arthur is silent beneath the weight of his memory. He dares a

glance over at Alike.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

`Member how we used to--

ALIKE

I've been accepted into a early

college program. Starts in the

Spring. Berkeley.

ARTHUR

California's a long way away--

ALIKE

Ten weeks writing boot camp,

workshops. Then I can start summer

semester.

98.

ARTHUR

We can talk about that. Okay?

ALIKE

I need you to meet with my guidance

counselor. Sign the paperwork so I

can graduate early.

ARTHUR

I'm sorry, alright? I'm sorry I let

her hurt you--

ALIKE

I need to know now if you'll sign

the papers. Yes or no?

ARTHUR

Can you forgive me?

ALIKE

Yes or no?

ARTHUR

You can always come back home.

Things are gonna be different, I

promise you--

Alike holds Arthur's hand, stopping him.

ALIKE

Dad, I'm not running. I'm choosing.

Arthur's heart breaks, he gasps back a sob.

ALIKE (CONT'D)

I'm not going back home.

ARTHUR

I know.

(beat)

Okay.

Alike nods, squeezes Arthur's hand. Arthur breathes deeply,

composing himself. He starts to pull away.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

I better--

ALIKE

Tell Mom that she was right.

ARTHUR

Right about what?

99.

ALIKE

God doesn't make mistakes.

ARTHUR

You should tell her yourself.

AUDREY

He told me, yes.

Audrey disappears into the hallway.

84A   EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY                                         84A

Alike writes in her notebook, mouthing the words to a poem.

She looks up and studies the horizon from time to time.

84B   INT. CLASSROOM - DAY                                       84B

Alike relaxes at a desk, reading from her notebook. Mrs.

Alvarado sits cross-legged on her desk listening.

ALIKE (V.O.)

Heartbreak opens onto the sunrise

For even breaking is opening

And I am broken

I am open

Broken to the new light without

pushing in

Open to the possibilities within

pushing out

See the love shine in through my

cracks

See the light shine out through me?

I am broken

I am open

I am Broken Open

See the love-light shining through

me

Shining through my cracks

Through the gaps

My Spirit takes journey

My Spirit takes flight

Could not have risen otherwise

And I am not Running

I am Choosing

Running is not a Choice

From the Breaking

Breaking is freeing

Broken is freedom

I am not broken

I am free.

Alike closes her book. The pair reflect in easy silence. Mrs.

Alvarado nods.

MRS. ALVARADO

Yeah.

(beat)

Yeah.
