JANE

I need a father who's a role model, not

some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his

shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home

from school.

(snorts)

What a lame-o. Somebody really should put

him out of his misery.

RICKY (O.C.)

Want me to kill him for you?

JANE

(deadpan)

Yeah, would you?

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

LESTER (V.O.)

My name is Lester Burnham. This is my

neighborhood. This is my street. This...

is my life. I'm forty-two years old. In

less than a year, I'll be dead.

LESTER (V.O.)

Of course, I don't know that yet. He

rolls over, looks up at us and sighs. He

doesn't seem too thrilled at the prospect

of a new day.

(CONTINUED)

2.

LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And in a way, I'm dead already.

LESTER (V.O.)

(amused)

Look at me, jerking off in the shower.

(then)

This will be the high point of my day.

It's all downhill from here.

LESTER (V.O.)

That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the

handle on those pruning shears matches

her gardening clogs? That's not an

accident.

JIM #1

Hush, Bitsy. You hush. What is wrong?

LESTER (V.O.)

That's our next-door neighbor Jim.

(CONTINUED)

3.

LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And that's his lover, Jim.

JIM #2

(re: barking dog)

What in the world is wrong with her? She

had a walk this morning.

JIM #1

And a jerky treat.

JIM #2

You spoil her.

(sternly)

Bitsy. No bark. Come inside. Now.

CAROLYN

Good morning, Jim!

JIM #1

Morning, Carolyn.

CAROLYN

(overly friendly)

I just love your tie! That color!

JIM #1

I just love your roses. How do you get

them to flourish like this?

CAROLYN

Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and

Miracle Grow.

LESTER (V.O.)

Man. I get exhausted just watching her.

LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

She wasn't always like this. She used to

be happy. We used to be happy.

4.

LESTER (V.O.)

My daughter Jane. Only child.

LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Janie's a pretty typical teenager. Angry,

insecure, confused. I wish I could tell

her that's all going to pass...

LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

But I don't want to lie to her.

CAROLYN

Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look

unattractive?

JANE

Yes.

CAROLYN

Well, congratulations. You've succeeded

admirably.

(CONTINUED)

5.

CAROLYN (CONT'D)

Lester, could you make me a little later,

please? Because I'm not quite late

enough.

JANE

Nice going, Dad.

LESTER (V.O.)

Both my wife and daughter think I'm this

gigantic loser, and... they're right.

LESTER (V.O.)

I have lost something. I'm not exactly

sure what it is, but I know I didn't

always feel this... sedated. But you know

what? It's never too late to get it back.

LESTER

Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media

Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr.

Tamblin, please?... Well, we're all under

a deadline here, uh, but you see, there

is some basic information about the

product launch that isn't even covered in

your press release and I... Yeah. Can I

ask you a question? Who is Tamblin? Does

he exist? 'Cause he doesn't ever seem to

come in... Yeah, okay, I'll leave my

number...

(CONTINUED)

6.

LESTER (CONT'D)

It's 555 0199. Lester Burnham. Thank you!

BRAD

Hey Les. You got a minute?

LESTER

For you, Brad? I've got five.

BRAD

I'm sure you can understand our need to

cut corners around here.

LESTER

Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta

free up cash. Gotta spend money to make

money. Right?

BRAD

Exactly. So...

LESTER

(blurts)

Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the

company MasterCard to pay for that

hooker, and then she used the card

numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for,

what was it, like, three months?

BRAD

(startled)

That's unsubstantiated gossip.

LESTER

That's fifty thousand dollars. That's

somebody's salary. That's somebody who's

gonna get fired because Craig has to pay

women to fuck him!

(CONTINUED)

7.

BRAD

Jesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired

yet. That's why we're having everyone

write out a job description, mapping out

in detail how they contribute. That way,

management can assess who's valuable and--

LESTER

Who's expendable.

BRAD

It's just business.

LESTER

(angry)

I've been writing for this magazine for

fourteen years, Brad. You've been here

how long, a whole month?

BRAD

(frank)

I'm one of the good guys, Les. I'm trying

to level with you. This is your one

chance to save your job.

CAROLYN

--there is no decision, you just write

the damn thing!

LESTER

You don't think it's weird and kinda

fascist?

CAROLYN

Possibly. But you don't want to be

unemployed.

LESTER

Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls

and work for Satan, because it's more

convenient that way.

(CONTINUED)

8.

CAROLYN

Could you be just a little bit more

dramatic, please, huh?

CAROLYN (CONT'D)

So we've finally got new neighbors. You

know, if the Lomans had let me represent

them, instead of--

(heavy disdain)

--"The Real Estate King," that house

would never have sat on the market for

six months.

LESTER

Well, they were still mad at you for

cutting down their sycamore.

CAROLYN

Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial

portion of the root structure was on our

property. You know that. How can you call

it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the

heart to just cut down something if it

wasn't partially mine, which of course it

was.

JANE

Mom, do we always have to listen to this

elevator music?

CAROLYN

(considers)

No. No, we don't. As soon as you've

prepared a nutritious yet savory meal

that I'm about to eat, you can listen to

whatever you like.

(CONTINUED)

9.

LESTER

So Janie, how was school?

JANE

(suspicious)

It was okay.

LESTER

Just okay?

JANE

No, Dad. It was spec-tac-ular.

LESTER

Well, you want to know how things went at

my job today?

LESTER (CONT'D)

They've hired this efficiency expert,

this really friendly guy named Brad, how

perfect is that? And he's basically there

to make it seem like they're justified in

firing somebody, because they couldn't

just come right out and say that, could

they? No, no, that would be too...

honest. And so they've asked us--

(off her look)

--you couldn't possibly care any less,

could you?

JANE

(uncomfortable)

Well, what do you expect? You can't all

of a sudden be my best friend, just

because you had a bad day.

JANE (CONT'D)

I mean, hello. You've barely even spoken

to me for months.

LESTER

Oh, what, you're mother-of-the-year? You

treat her like an employee.

(CONTINUED)

10.

CAROLYN

(taken aback)

What?!

CAROLYN (CONT'D)

(more authority)

What?

LESTER

I'm going to get some ice cream.

LESTER

Honey, I'm sorry. I...

LESTER (CONT'D)

I'm sorry I haven't been more available,

I just... I'm...

LESTER (CONT'D)

(finally)

You know, you don't always have to wait

for me to come to you...

JANE

Oh, great. So now it's my fault?

LESTER

I didn't say that. It's nobody's fault.

Janie, what happened? You and I used to

be pals.

(CONTINUED)

11.

12.

CAROLYN

I will sell this house today.

MONTAGE:

CAROLYN (CONT'D)

I will sell this house today. I will sell

this house today. I will sell this house

today.

CAROLYN

I will sell this house today.

CAROLYN

Welcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham!

13.

CAROLYN

This living room is very dramatic. Wait

'til you see the native stone fireplace!

CAROLYN (CONT'D)

A simple cream would really lighten

things up. You could even put in a

skylight.

CAROLYN (CONT'D)

Well, why don't we go into the kitchen?

CAROLYN

It's a dream come true for any cook. Just

filled with positive energy. Huh?

CAROLYN

...and you'll be surprised how much a

ceiling fan can cut down on your energy

costs.

CAROLYN

You know, you could have some really fun

backyard get-togethers out here.

WOMAN #1

The ad said this pool was "lagoon-like."

There's nothing "lagoon-like" about it.

Except for maybe the bugs.

(CONTINUED)

14.

WOMAN #2

There's not even any plants out here.

CAROLYN

(re: shrub)

What do you call this? Is this not a

plant? If you have a problem with the

plants, I can always call my landscape

architect. Solved.

WOMAN #2

I mean, I think "lagoon," I think

waterfall, I think tropical. This is a

cement hole.

CAROLYN

I have some tiki torches in the garage.

CAROLYN

Shut up. Stop it. You... Weak!

CAROLYN (CONT'D)

Weak. Baby. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

(CONTINUED)

15.

ANGELA

Who are you looking for?

JANE

My parents are coming tonight. They're

trying to, you know, take an active

interest in me.

ANGELA

Gross. I hate it when my mom does that.

JANE

They're such assholes. Why can't they

just have their own lives?

LESTER

What makes you so sure she wants us to be

there? Did she ask us to come?

CAROLYN

Of course not. She doesn't want us to

know how important this is to her. But

she's been practicing her steps for

weeks.

LESTER

Well, I bet money she's going to resent

it. And I'm missing the James Bond

marathon on TNT.

CAROLYN

Lester, this is important. I'm sensing a

real distance growing between you and

Jane.

LESTER

Growing? She hates me.

CAROLYN

She's just willful.

(CONTINUED)

16.

LESTER

She hates you too.

ANNOUNCER

(over P.A.)

And now, for your half-time

entertainment, Rockwell High's award-

winning Dancing Spartanettes!

LESTER

We can leave right after this, right?

17.

JANE

Oh shit, they're still here.

LESTER

Janie!

CAROLYN

Hi! I really enjoyed that!

LESTER

Congratulations, honey, you were great.

JANE

I didn't win anything.

LESTER

(to Angela)

Hi, I'm Lester. Janie's dad.

ANGELA

Oh. Hi.

JANE

This is my friend, Angela Hayes.

LESTER

Okay, good to meet you. You were also

good tonight. Very... precise.

(CONTINUED)

18.

ANGELA

(warming)

Thanks.

CAROLYN

(to Angela)

Nice to meet you, Angela.

(to Jane)

Honey, I'm so proud of you. I watched you

very closely, and you didn't screw up

once.

(then, to Lester)

Okay, we have to go.

LESTER

So, what are you girls doing now?

JANE

Dad.

ANGELA

We're going out for pizza.

LESTER

Oh really, do you need a ride? We can

give you a ride. I have a car. You wanna

come with us?

ANGELA

Thanks... but I have a car.

LESTER

Oh, you have a car. Oh. That's great!

That's great, because Janie's thinking

about getting a car soon too, aren't you,

honey?

JANE

(you freak)

Dad. Mom's waiting for you.

LESTER

Well, it was very nice meeting you,

Angela. Any, uh, friend of Janie's is a

friend of mine.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Well... I'll be seeing you around then.

(CONTINUED)

19.

JANE

Could he be any more pathetic?

ANGELA

I think it's sweet. And I think he and

your mother have not had sex in a long

time.

LESTER

It's the weirdest thing.

LESTER (CONT'D)

I feel like I've been in a coma for about

twenty years, and I'm just now waking up.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Spec-tac-ular.

JANE

I'm sorry my dad was so weird tonight.

(CONTINUED)

20.

ANGELA

It's okay. I'm used to guys drooling over

me. It started when I was about twelve,

I'd go out to dinner with my parents.

Every Thursday night, Red Lobster. And

every guy there would stare at me when I

walked in. And I knew what they were

thinking. Just like I knew guys at school

thought about me when they jerked off.

JANE

Vomit.

ANGELA

No, I liked it. And I still like it. If

people I don't even know look at me and

want to fuck me, it means I really have a

shot at being a model. Which is great,

because there's nothing worse in life

than being ordinary.

JANE

I really think it'll happen for you.

ANGELA

Oh, I know. Because everything that was

meant to happen, does. Eventually.

JANE

Asshole.

21.

ANGELA

(over phone line)

Hello? Hello?

JANE

Hello?

ANGELA

Why'd you call me?

INTERCUT WITH JANE IN HER

BEDROOM:

JANE

I didn't.

ANGELA

Well, my phone just rang and I answered

it and somebody hung up and then I star

sixty-nined and it called you back.

(CONTINUED)

22.

JANE

I was in the shower.

JANE (CONT'D)

Oh, gross.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)

(sing song)

Rick-y! Break-fast!

RICKY

Be right there.

RICKY

Mom.

BARBARA

Hello.

RICKY

I don't eat bacon, remember?

BARBARA

(unnerved)

I'm sorry, I must have forgotten.

(CONTINUED)

23.

RICKY

What's new in the world, Dad?

COLONEL

This country is going straight to hell.

COLONEL (CONT'D)

Are you expecting anyone?

BARBARA

No.

(thinks)

No.

JIM #1

Hi.

JIM #2

Welcome to the neighborhood.

JIM #1

Just a little something from our garden.

JIM #2

Except for the pasta, we got that at

Fallaci's.

JIM #1

It's unbelievably fresh. You just drop it

in the water and it's done.

JIM #1 (CONT'D)

(offers his hand)

Jim Olmeyer. Two doors down. Welcome to

the neighborhood.

COLONEL

(shakes)

Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.

(CONTINUED)

24.

JIM #1

Nice to meet you. And this is my

partner...

JIM #2

(offers his hand)

Jim Berkley, but people call me J.B.

COLONEL

Let's cut to the chase, okay? What are

you guys selling?

JIM #2

(after a beat)

Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our

new neighbors--

COLONEL

Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you said you're

partners. So what's your business?

JIM #1

Well, he's a tax attorney.

JIM #2

And he's an anesthesiologist.

COLONEL

How come these faggots always have to rub

it in your face? How can they be so

shameless?

RICKY

That's the whole thing, Dad. They don't

feel like it's anything to be ashamed of.

COLONEL

Well, it is.

(CONTINUED)

25.

RICKY

Yeah, you're right.

COLONEL

Don't placate me like I'm your mother,

boy.

RICKY

Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly,

but those fags make me want to puke my

fucking guts out.

COLONEL

Me too, son. Me too.

ANGELA

I'm serious, he just pulled down his

pants and yanked it out. You know, like,

say hello to Mr. Happy.

ANGELA

It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.

ANGELA

Of course I did. He is a really well-

known photographer? He shoots for Elle on

like, a regular basis? It would have been

so majorly stupid of me to turn him down.

26.

ANGELA

Hey. That's how things really are. You

just don't know, because you're this

pampered little suburban chick.

ANGELA

(calling off)

Cunt!

(then)

I am so sick of people taking their

insecurities out on me.

JANE

Oh my God. That's the pervert who filmed

me last night.

ANGELA

Him? Jane. No way. He's a total lunatic.

JANE

You know him?

ANGELA

Yeah. We were on the same lunch shift

when I was in ninth grade, and he would

always say the most random, weird things,

and then one day, he was just like, gone.

And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his

parents had to put him in a mental

institution.

JANE

Why? What did he do?

ANGELA

What do you mean?

(CONTINUED)

27.

JANE

Well, they can't put you away just for

saying weird things.

ANGELA

You total slut. You've got a crush on

him.

JANE

What? Please.

ANGELA

You were defending him! You love him. You

want to have like, ten thousand of his

babies.

JANE

Shut up.

RICKY

Hi. My name's Ricky. I just moved next

door to you.

JANE

I know. I kinda remember this really

creepy incident when you were filming me

last night?

RICKY

I didn't mean to scare you. I just think

you're interesting.

JANE

Thanks, but I really don't need to have

some psycho obsessing about me right now.

RICKY

I'm not obsessing. I'm just curious.

ANGELA

What a freak. And why does he dress like

a Bible salesman?

(CONTINUED)

28.

JANE

He's like, so confident. That can't be

real.

ANGELA

I don't believe him. I mean, he didn't

even like, look at me once.

RICKY

Hey.

BARBARA

(out of the blue)

I'm sorry, what?

RICKY

Mom. Nobody said anything.

BARBARA

Oh. I'm sorry.

CAROLYN

--everyone here is with their spouse or

their significant other. How would it

look if I showed up with no one?

(CONTINUED)

29.

LESTER

Well, you always end up ignoring me and

going off--

CAROLYN

Now listen to me. This is an important

business function. As you know, my

business is selling an image. And part of

my job is to live that image--

LESTER

Just say whatever you want to say and

spare me the propaganda.

CAROLYN

(spots someone)

Hi, Shirley!

(to Lester)

Listen, just do me a favor. Act happy

tonight?

LESTER

(grins stupidly)

I am happy, honey.

CAROLYN

(spots someone)

Oh! Buddy!

CAROLYN (CONT'D)

(shakes Buddy's hand)

Buddy! Buddy. Hi! Good to see you again.

BUDDY

It's so good to see you too, Catherine.

CAROLYN

Carolyn.

BUDDY

Carolyn! Of course. How are you?

(CONTINUED)

30.

CAROLYN

Very well, thank you.

(to his wife)

Hello, Christy.

CHRISTY

Hello.

CAROLYN

My husband, Lester--

BUDDY

(shakes Lester's hand)

It's a pleasure.

LESTER

Oh, we've met before, actually. This

thing last year. Or the Christmas thing

at the Sheraton.

BUDDY

Oh, yes.

LESTER

It's okay. I wouldn't remember me either.

CAROLYN

(forced gaiety)

Honey. Don't be weird.

LESTER

All right, honey. I won't be weird.

(his face close to hers)

I'll be whatever you want me to be.

LESTER (CONT'D)

We have a very healthy relationship.

BUDDY

I see.

(CONTINUED)

31.

LESTER

Well. I don't know about you, but I need

a drink.

LESTER

Whoa. Put a little more in there, cowboy.

RICKY

Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood

Trail? The house with the red door?

LESTER

(suspicious)

Yeah.

RICKY

I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved into the

house next to you.

LESTER

Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts. I'm Lester Burnham.

RICKY

Hi, Lester Burnham.

RICKY (CONT'D)

Do you party?

LESTER

Excuse me?

RICKY

Do you get high?

(CONTINUED)

32.

CAROLYN

You know, I probably wouldn't even tell

you this if I weren't a little tipsy,

but... I am in complete awe of you. I

mean, your firm is, hands down, the Rolls

Royce of local Real Estate firms, and

your personal sales record is, is, is

very intimidating. You know, I'd love to

sit down with you and just pick your

brain, if you'd ever be willing. I

suppose, technically, I'm the

"competition," but... I mean, hey, I

don't flatter myself that I'm even in the

same league as you...

BUDDY

I'd love to.

CAROLYN

(shocked)

Really?

BUDDY

Absolutely. Call my secretary and have

her schedule a lunch.

CAROLYN

I'll do that. Thank you.

LESTER

...did you ever see that movie, where the

body's walking around holding its own

head? And then the head goes down on that

babe?

RICKY

Re-Animator.

(CONTINUED)

33.

CATERING BOSS

(to Ricky)

Look. I'm not paying you to...

(eyes Lester, suspiciously)

...do whatever it is you're doing out

here.

RICKY

Fine. So don't pay me.

CATERING BOSS

Excuse me?

RICKY

I quit. So you don't have to pay me. Now,

leave me alone.

CATERING BOSS

Asshole.

LESTER

I think you just became my personal hero.

(then)

Doesn't that make you nervous, just

quitting your job like that? Well, I

guess when you're all of, what? Sixteen?

RICKY

Eighteen.

(then)

I just do these gigs as a cover. I have

other sources of income. But my dad

interferes less in my life when I pretend

to be an upstanding young citizen with a

respectable job.

CAROLYN (O.C.)

Lester?

CAROLYN (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

(CONTINUED)

34.

LESTER

Honey, this is...

(laughs)

Ricky Fitts. This is Ricky Fitts.

RICKY

I'm Ricky Fitts, I just moved in the

house next to you. I go to school with

your daughter.

LESTER

With Jane? Really?

RICKY

Yeah. Jane.

CAROLYN

Hi.

(then, to Lester)

I'm ready to go. I'll meet you out front.

LESTER

Uh-oh. I'm in trouble. Nice meeting you,

Ricky Fitts. Thanks for the, uh, thing.

RICKY

Any time.

RICKY (CONT'D)

(calls after him)

Lester. If you want any more, you know

where I live.

JANE

Oh, shit. They're home. Quick, let's go

up to my room.

ANGELA

I should say hi to your dad.

(off Jane's look)

I don't want to be rude.

35.

ANGELA (O.C.)

Nice suit.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

You're looking good, Mr. Burnham.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

Last time I saw you, you looked kind of

wound up.

(spots something)

Ooh, is that root beer?

ANGELA

I love root beer, don't you?

(CONTINUED)

36.

JANE

Mom, you remember Angela.

CAROLYN

(her sales smile)

Yes, of course!

JANE

I forgot to tell you, she's spending the

night. Is that okay?

LESTER

Sure!

JANE

I'm sorry about my dad.

ANGELA

Don't be. I think it's funny.

JANE

Yeah, to you, he's just another guy who

wants to jump your bones. But to me...

he's just too embarrassing to live.

ANGELA

Your mom's the one who's embarrassing.

What a phony.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

Your dad's actually kind of cute.

JANE

Shut up.

37.

ANGELA (O.C.)

He is. If he just worked out a little,

he'd be hot.

JANE

Shut up.

ANGELA

Oh, come on. Like you've never sneaked a

peek at him in his underwear? I bet he's

got a big dick.

JANE

You are so grossing me out right now.

ANGELA

(really enjoying this)

If he built up his chest and arms, I

would totally fuck him.

ANGELA (O.C.)

(laughs)

I would! I would suck your dad's big fat

dick, and then I would fuck him 'til his

eyes rolled back in his head!

(then)

What was that noise? Jane.

ANGELA (O.C.) (CONT'D)

I swear I heard something.

JANE

Yeah, it was the sound of you being a

huge disgusting pig.

(CONTINUED)

38.

ANGELA

I'm serious.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

See?

ANGELA (CONT'D)

(spots something)

Oh my God. Jane.

ANGELA

It's that psycho next door. Jane, what if

he worships you? What if he's got a

shrine with pictures of you surrounded by

dead people's heads and stuff?

JANE

Shit. I bet he's filming us right now.

ANGELA

(intrigued)

Really?

Shit. Shit!

Coming, Dad.

COLONEL (O.C.)

You know I don't like locked doors in my

house, boy.

RICKY

I'm sorry, I must have locked it by

accident. So what's up?

COLONEL

I need a urine sample.

RICKY

Wow. It's been six months already. Can I

give it to you in the morning? I just

took a whiz.

COLONEL

Yeah, I suppose.

(an awkward beat)

Well. Good night, son.

41.

ANGELA

I've been waiting for you.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

You've been working out, haven't you? I

can tell.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

I was hoping you'd give me a bath... I'm

very, very dirty.

CAROLYN

What are you doing?

LESTER

Nothing.

CAROLYN

You were masturbating.

(CONTINUED)

42.

LESTER

I was not.

CAROLYN

Yes, you were.

LESTER

All right, so shoot me. I was whacking

off.

LESTER (CONT'D)

That's right. I was choking the bishop.

Shaving the carrot. Saying hi to my

monster.

CAROLYN

That's disgusting.

LESTER

Well, excuse me, but I still have blood

pumping through my veins!

CAROLYN

So do I!

LESTER

Really? I'm the only one who seems to be

doing anything about it.

CAROLYN

Lester. I refuse to live like this. This

is not a marriage.

LESTER

This hasn't been a marriage for years.

But you were happy as long as I kept my

mouth shut. Well, guess what? I've

changed. And the new me whacks off when

he feels horny, because you're obviously

not going to help me out in that

department.

CAROLYN

Oh. I see. You think you're the only one

who's sexually frustrated?

LESTER

I'm not? Well then, come on, baby! I'm

ready.

(CONTINUED)

43.

CAROLYN

(furious)

Do not mess with me, mister, or I will

divorce you so fast it'll make your head

spin!

LESTER

On what grounds? I'm not a drunk, I don't

fuck other women, I don't mistreat you,

I've never hit you, or even tried to

touch you since you made it so abundantly

clear just how unnecessary you consider

me to be. But. I did support you while

you got your license. And some people

might think that entitles me to half of

what's yours.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Turn out the light when you come to bed,

okay?

LESTER

It's a great thing when you realize you

still have the ability to surprise

yourself. Makes you wonder what else you

can do that you've forgotten about.

LESTER

Hey! You guys!

(CONTINUED)

44.

JIM #2

Lester, I didn't know you ran.

LESTER

(panting)

Well, I just started.

JIM #1

Good for you.

LESTER

I figured you guys might be able to give

me some pointers. I need to shape up.

Fast.

JIM #1

Well, are you just looking to lose

weight, or do you want have increased

strength and flexibility as well?

LESTER

I want to look good naked.

COLONEL

What is this, the fucking gay pride

parade?

LESTER

Hey! Yo! Ricky!

(re: the Jims)

My entire life is passing before my eyes,

and those two have barely broken a sweat.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Sorry, hi. Lester Burnham, I live next

door. We haven't met.

(CONTINUED)

45.

COLONEL

(shakes)

COLONEL Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.

LESTER

Whoa. Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.

LESTER (CONT'D)

So, Ricky, uh, I was thinking about the,

uh... I was gonna... the movie we talked

about...

RICKY

(quickly)

Re-Animator.

LESTER

Yeah!

RICKY

You want to borrow it?

(before Lester can answer)

Okay, it's up in my room. Come on.

RICKY

Can you hold this for a sec?

LESTER

Sure.

RICKY

I don't think my dad would try to come in

when somebody else is here, but you never

know.

LESTER

(re: urine sample)

What is this?

(CONTINUED)

46.

RICKY

Urine. I have to take a drug test every

six months to make sure I'm clean.

LESTER

Are you kidding? You just smoked with me

last night.

RICKY

It's not mine. One of my clients is a

nurse in a pediatrician's office. I cut

her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss.

LESTER

You like Pink Floyd?

RICKY

I like a lot of music.

LESTER

Man, I haven't listened to this album in

years.

RICKY

How much do you want?

LESTER

I don't know, it's been a while. How much

is an ounce?

RICKY

(indicates bag)

Well, this is totally decent, and it's

three hundred.

LESTER

Wow.

RICKY

(indicates another bag)

But this shit is top of the line. It's

called G-13. Genetically engineered by

the U.S. Government. Extremely potent.

But a completely mellow high, no

paranoia.

(CONTINUED)

47.

LESTER

Is that what we smoked last night?

RICKY

This is all I ever smoke.

LESTER

How much?

RICKY

Two grand.

LESTER

Jesus. Things have changed since 1973.

RICKY

You don't have to pay now. I know you're

good for it.

LESTER

Thanks.

RICKY

(hands him a bag)

There's a card in there with my beeper

number, call me anytime day or night. And

I only accept cash.

LESTER

(looks around room)

Well, now I know how you can afford all

this equipment. When I was your age, I

flipped burgers all summer just to be

able to buy an eight track.

RICKY

That sucks.

LESTER

No actually, it was great. All I did was

party and get laid.

(smiles)

I had my whole life ahead of me...

RICKY

My dad thinks I pay for all this with

catering jobs.

(off Lester's look)

Never underestimate the power of denial.

48.

LESTER

Uh-oh, mom's mad.

CAROLYN

What the hell do you think you're doing?

LESTER

Bench presses. I'm going to wail on my

pecs, and then I'm going to do my back.

CAROLYN

I see you're smoking pot now. I'm so

glad. I think using illegal psychotropic

substances is a very positive example to

set for our daughter.

LESTER

You're one to talk, you bloodless, money-

grubbing freak.

(CONTINUED)

49.

CAROLYN

(hostile)

Lester. You have such hostility in you!

LESTER

Do you mind? I'm trying to work out here.

(then, suggestively)

Unless you want to spot me.

CAROLYN

You will not get away with this. You can

be sure of that!

LESTER

(as he lifts)

That's. What. You. Think.

BRAD

(reads)

"...my job consists of basically masking

my contempt for the assholes in charge,

and, at least once a day, retiring to the

men's room so I can jerk off, while I

fantasize about a life that doesn't so

closely resemble hell."

(looks up at Lester)

Well, you obviously have no interest in

saving yourself.

LESTER

(laughs)

Brad, for fourteen years I've been a

whore for the advertising industry. The

only way I could save myself now is if I

start firebombing.

BRAD

Whatever. Management wants you gone by

the end of the day.

LESTER

Well, just what sort of severance package

is "management" prepared to offer me?

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

50.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Considering the information I have about

our editorial director buying pussy with

company money.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Which I'm sure would interest the I.R.S.,

since it technically constitutes fraud.

And I'm sure that some of our advertisers

and rival publications might like to know

about it as well. Not to mention, Craig's

wife.

BRAD

What do you want?

LESTER

One year's salary, with benefits.

BRAD

That's not going to happen.

LESTER

Well, what do you say I throw in a little

sexual harassment charge to boot?

BRAD

Against who?

LESTER

Against you.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Can you prove you didn't offer to save my

job if I'd let you blow me?

BRAD

Man. You are one twisted fuck.

LESTER

(standing)

Nope. I'm just an ordinary guy with

nothing to lose.

51.

LESTER

Yeah!

BUDDY

Carolyn.

CAROLYN

Buddy.

BUDDY

I'm so sorry I kept you waiting. Christy

left for New York this morning, and...

let's just say things were very hectic

around the house.

CAROLYN

What's she doing in New York?

BUDDY

She's moving there.

(off Carolyn's look)

Yes. We are splitting up.

CAROLYN

Buddy. I'm so sorry.

BUDDY

(bitterly)

Yes, according to her, I'm too focused on

my career. As if being driven to succeed

is some sort of character flaw. Well, she

certainly knew how to take advantage of

the lifestyle my success afforded her.

Oh. Wow.

(then, laughing)

Ah, it's for the best.

(CONTINUED)

52.

CAROLYN

When I saw you two at the party the other

night, you seemed perfectly happy.

BUDDY

Well, call me crazy, but it is my

philosophy that in order to be

successful, one must project an image of

success, at all times.

ANGELA (O.C.)

What are you doing?

RICKY (O.C.)

I was filming this dead bird.

ANGELA

Why?

RICKY (O.C.)

Because it's beautiful.

ANGELA

I think maybe you forgot your medication

today, mental boy.

RICKY (O.C.)

Hi, Jane.

JANE

(uncomfortable)

Look. I want you to stop filming me.

(CONTINUED)

53.

RICKY

Okay.

ANGELA

Well, whatever.

(to Jane)

This is boring. Let's go.

JANE

(to Ricky)

Do you need a ride?

ANGELA

(to Jane)

Are you crazy? I don't want to end up

hacked to pieces in a dumpster somewhere.

RICKY

It's okay. I'll walk. But thanks.

ANGELA

Yeah, see? He doesn't want to go anyway.

C'mon, let's go.

JANE

(calls off to Angela)

I think I'm going to walk, too.

ANGELA

What? Jane, that's like, almost a mile.

CAROLYN

Yes! Oh, God! I love it!

BUDDY

You like getting nailed by the king?

(CONTINUED)

54.

CAROLYN

Oh yes! I love it! Fuck me, your majesty!

LESTER

AMERICAN WOMAN, STAY AWAY FROM ME...

AMERICAN WOMAN, MAMA LET ME BE... DON'T

COME A HANGIN' AROUND MY DOOR... I DON'T

WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE NO MORE...

DRIVE-THRU GIRL (O.C.)

(over speaker box)

Smile you're at Mr. Smiley's.

LESTER

What?

DRIVE-THRU GIRL (O.C.)

Would you like to try our new bacon and

egg fajita just a dollar twenty-nine for

a limited time only.

LESTER

Uh... no. But thank you.

(reading menu)

I'll have a Big Barn Burger, Smiley

fries, and an orange soda.

DRIVE-THRU GIRL (O.C.)

Please drive up to the window, thank you.

(CONTINUED)

55.

DRIVE-THRU GIRL (CONT'D)

Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's, that'll be

four eighty-nine, please.

COUNTER GIRL

Would you like some Smiley Sauce?

LESTER

No. No, actually... I'd like to fill out

an application.

COUNTER GIRL

There's not jobs for manager, it's just

for counter.

LESTER

Good. I'm looking for the least possible

amount of responsibility.

MANAGER

I don't think you'd fit in here.

LESTER

I have fast food experience.

MANAGER

Yeah, like twenty years ago.

LESTER

Well, I'm sure there have been amazing

technological advances in the industry,

but surely you have some sort of training

process. It seems unfair to presume I

won't be able to learn.

56.

CAROLYN

That was exactly what I needed. The royal

treatment, so to speak.

CAROLYN (CONT'D)

I was so stressed out.

BUDDY

Know what I do when I feel like that?

CAROLYN

What?

BUDDY

I fire a gun.

CAROLYN

(intrigued)

Really.

BUDDY

Oh yeah, I go to this little firing range

downtown, and I just pop off a few

rounds.

CAROLYN

(embarrassed)

I've never fired a gun before.

BUDDY

Oh, you've gotta try it. Nothing makes

you feel more powerful.

(smiles seductively)

Well, almost nothing.

JANE

So how do you like your new house?

(CONTINUED)

57.

RICKY

I like it.

JANE

The people who used to live there fed

these stray cats, so they were always

around, and it drove my mother nuts. And

then she cut down their tree.

RICKY

Have you ever known anybody who died?

JANE

No.

(a beat)

Have you?

RICKY

No, but I did see this homeless woman who

froze to death once. Just laying there on

the sidewalk. She looked really sad.

RICKY (CONT'D)

I got that homeless woman on video.

JANE

Why would you film that?

RICKY

Because it was amazing.

JANE

What was amazing about it?

RICKY

When you see something like that, it's

like God is looking right at you, just

for a second. And if you're careful, you

can look right back.

JANE

And what do you see?

(CONTINUED)

58.

RICKY

Beauty.

RICKY

Mom, I want you to meet somebody.

(no response)

Mom.

BARBARA

(pleasant)

Yes?

RICKY

I want you to meet somebody. This is

Jane.

JANE

Hi.

BARBARA

Oh, my. I apologize for the way things

look around here.

RICKY

This is where my dad hides out.

JANE

I take it he's got a thing for guns.

RICKY

You got to see this one thing...

(CONTINUED)

59.

RICKY (CONT'D)

My dad would kill me if he knew I was in

here.

JANE

Did you steal his keys?

RICKY

No. One of my clients is a locksmith. He

was short on cash one night, so I let him

pay me in trade.

RICKY (CONT'D)

Turn it over.

JANE

Oh my God.

RICKY

It's like official state china of the

Third Reich. There's a whole subculture

of people who collect this Nazi shit. But

my dad just has this one thing.

RICKY (CONT'D)

What's wrong?

JANE

Nothing.

RICKY

(concerned)

No, you're scared of me.

JANE

No I'm not.

RICKY

You want to see the most beautiful thing

I've ever filmed?

60.

RICKY

It was one of those days when it's a

minute away from snowing. And there's

this electricity in the air, you can

almost hear it, right? And this bag was

just... dancing with me. Like a little

kid begging me to play with it. For

fifteen minutes. That's the day I

realized that there was this entire life

behind things, and this incredibly

benevolent force that wanted me to know

there was no reason to be afraid. Ever.

RICKY (CONT'D)

Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it

helps me remember... I need to

remember...

RICKY (CONT'D)

(distant)

Sometimes there's so much beauty in the

world I feel like I can't take it... and

my heart is going to cave in.

JANE

(suddenly)

Oh my God. What time is it?

(CONTINUED)

61.

JANE

Sorry I'm late.

CAROLYN

(overly cheerful)

No, no, that's quite all right, dear.

Your father and I were just discussing

his day at work.

(to Lester)

Why don't you tell our daughter about it,

honey?

LESTER

Janie, today I quit my job. And then I

told my boss to fuck himself, and then I

blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand

dollars. Pass the asparagus.

CAROLYN

Your father seems to think this kind of

behavior is something to be proud of.

LESTER

And your mother seems to prefer I go

through life like a fucking prisoner

while she keeps my dick in a mason jar

under the sink.

CAROLYN

(ashen)

How dare you speak to me that way in

front of her? And I marvel that you can

be so contemptuous of me, on the same day

that you lose your job!

LESTER

Lose it? I didn't lose it. It's not like,

"Oops, where'd my job go?" I quit.

Someone pass me the asparagus.

CAROLYN

Oh! Oh! And I want to thank you for

putting me under the added pressure of

being the sole breadwinner now--

LESTER

I already have a job.

(CONTINUED)

62.

CAROLYN

(not stopping)

No, no, don't give a second thought as to

who's going to pay the mortgage. We'll

just leave it all up to Carolyn. You

mean, you're going to take care of

everything now, Carolyn? Yes. I don't

mind. I really don't. You mean,

everything? You don't mind having the

sole responsibility, your husband feels

he can just quit his job--

LESTER

(overlapping)

Will someone pass me the fucking

asparagus?

JANE

(rises)

Okay, I'm not going to be a part of this--

LESTER

(means it)

Sit down.

LESTER (CONT'D)

I'm sick and tired of being treated    like

I don't exist. You two do whatever    you

want to do whenever you want to do    it and

I don't complain. All I want is the    same

courtesy--

CAROLYN

(overlapping)

Oh, you don't complain? Oh, excuse me.

Excuse me. I must be psychotic then, if

you don't complain. What is this?! Am I

locked away in a padded cell somewhere,

hallucinating? That's the only

explanation I can think of--

LESTER

(casual)

Don't interrupt me, honey.

(CONTINUED)

63.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Oh, and another thing. From now on, we're

going to alternate our dinner music.

Because frankly, and I don't think I'm

alone here, I'm really tired of this

Lawrence Welk shit.

JANE

Go. Away.

CAROLYN (O.C.)

Honey, please let me in.

CAROLYN (CONT'D)

I wish that you hadn't witnessed that

awful scene tonight. But in a way, I'm

glad.

JANE

Why, so I could see what freaks you and

Dad really are?

CAROLYN

Me?

JANE

Aw, Christ, Mom.

CAROLYN

(tearful)

No, I'm glad because you're old enough

now to learn the most important lesson in

life: you cannot count on anyone except

yourself.

(sighs)

You cannot count on anyone except

yourself. It's sad, but true, and the

sooner you learn it, the better.

(CONTINUED)

64.

JANE

Look, Mom, I really don't feel like

having a Kodak moment here, okay?

CAROLYN

You ungrateful little brat. Just look at

everything you have. When I was your age,

I lived in a duplex. We didn't even have

our own house.

COLONEL

You little bastard--

COLONEL (CONT'D)

How did you get in there?

65.

COLONEL

(unnerved)

How!? How?! C'mon, get up! Fight back,

you little pussy!

RICKY

No, sir. I won't fight you.

COLONEL

How did you get in there?

RICKY

I picked the lock, sir.

COLONEL

What were you looking for? Money? Are you

on dope again?

RICKY

No, sir. I wanted to show my girlfriend

your Nazi plate.

COLONEL

Girlfriend?

RICKY

Yes, sir. She lives next door.

RICKY (CONT'D)

Her name's Jane.

(CONTINUED)

66.

COLONEL

This is for your own good, boy. You have

no respect for other people's things, for

authority, for...

RICKY

Sir, I'm sorry.

COLONEL

You can't just go around doing whatever

you feel like, you can't--there are rules

in life--

RICKY

Yes, sir.

COLONEL

You need structure, you need discipline--

RICKY

(simultaneous)

Discipline. Yes, sir, thank you for

trying to teach me. Don't give up on me,

Dad.

COLONEL

Oh, Ricky...

COLONEL (CONT'D)

You stay out of there.

CAROLYN

Ah, whose car is that out front?

LESTER

Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird. The car I

always wanted and now I have it. I rule!

CAROLYN

Where's the Camry?

LESTER

I traded it in.

CAROLYN

Shouldn't you have consulted me first?

LESTER

Hmm, let me think... No. You never drove

it.

(then)

Have you done something different? You

look great.

CAROLYN

(brusque)

Where's Jane?

LESTER

Jane not home. We have the whole house to

ourselves.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Christ, Carolyn. When did you become

so... joyless?

CAROLYN

(taken aback)

Joyless?! I am not joyless! There happens

to be a lot about me that you don't know,

mister smarty man. There is plenty of joy

in my life.

(CONTINUED)

69.

LESTER

(leaning toward her)

Whatever happened to that girl who used

to fake seizures at frat parties when she

got bored? And who used to run up to the

roof of our first apartment building to

flash the traffic helicopters? Have you

totally forgotten about her? Because I

haven't.

CAROLYN

(barely audible)

Lester. You're going to spill beer on the

couch.

LESTER

So what? It's just a couch.

CAROLYN

This is a four thousand dollar sofa

upholstered in Italian silk. This is not

"just a couch."

LESTER

It's just a couch!

LESTER (CONT'D)

This isn't life. This is just stuff. And

it's become more important to you than

living. Well, honey, that's just nuts.

LESTER (CONT'D)

I'm only trying to help you.

Don't.

It's weird, watching myself. I don't like

how I look.

RICKY

I can't believe you don't know how

beautiful you are.

JANE

I'm not going to sit here for that shit.

JANE (CONT'D)

Ha. How does it feel now?

RICKY

Fine.

JANE

You don't feel naked?

RICKY

I am naked.

JANE

You know what I mean.

JANE (CONT'D)

Tell me about being in the hospital.

(CONTINUED)

71.

RICKY

When I was fifteen, my dad caught me

smoking dope. He totally freaked and

decided to send me to military school. I

told you his whole thing about structure

and discipline, right?

(laughs)

Well, of course, I got kicked out. Dad

and I had this huge fight, and he hit

me... and then the next day at school,

some kid made a crack about my haircut,

and... I just snapped. I wanted to kill

him. And I would have. Killed him. If

they hadn't pulled me off.

(then)

That's when my dad put me in the

hospital. Then they drugged me up and

left me in there for two years.

JANE

Wow. You must really hate him.

RICKY

He's not a bad man.

JANE

Well... you better believe I'd hate my

father if he did something like that to

me.

(laughs)

Wait. I do hate my father.

RICKY

Why?

JANE

He's a total asshole and he's got this

crush on my friend Angela and it's

disgusting.

RICKY

You'd rather he had the crush on you?

JANE

Gross, no! But it'd be nice if I was

anywhere near as important to him as she

is.

(then)

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

72.

JANE (CONT'D)

I know you think my dad's harmless, but

you're wrong. He's doing massive

psychological damage to me.

RICKY

How?

JANE

Well, now, I too need structure. A little

fucking discipline.

JANE (CONT'D)

I'm serious, though. How could he not be

damaging me? I need a father who's a role

model, not some horny geek-boy who's

gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a

girlfriend home from school.

(snorts)

What a lame-o. Somebody really should put

him out of his misery.

RICKY

Want me to kill him for you?

JANE

Yeah, would you?

RICKY

(smiles)

It'll cost you.

JANE

Well, I've been baby-sitting since I was

about ten. I've got almost three thousand

dollars. 'Course, I was saving it up for

a boob job.

JANE (CONT'D)

But my tits can wait, huh?

RICKY

You know, that's not a very nice thing to

do, hiring somebody to kill your dad.

(CONTINUED)

73.

JANE

Well, I guess I'm just not a very nice

girl, then, am I?

JANE (CONT'D)

(suddenly nervous)

You know I'm not serious, right?

Of course.

RICKY (CONT'D)

Do you know how lucky we are to have

found each other?

Jane, hurry up. I've got a very important

appointment--

JANE

Mom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over

tonight?

CAROLYN

Well, of course, she's always welcome.

(on her way out)

You know, I thought maybe you two had a

fight. I haven't seen her around here in

a while.

LESTER

What?

JANE

(nervous)

I've been too embarrassed to bring her

over. Because of you, and the way that

you behave.

LESTER

What are you talking about? I've barely

even spoken to her.

JANE

(angry)

Dad! You stare at her all the time, like

you're drunk! It's disgusting!

You ready to go?

LESTER

Her husband. We've met before, but

something tells me you're going to

remember me this time.

COUNTER GIRL

(to Carolyn)

Whoa. You are so busted.

CAROLYN

(flustered)

You know, this really doesn't concern

you.

LESTER

Actually, Janeane is senior drive-thru

manager, so you kind of are on her turf.

(to Carolyn, quietly)

So. This makes sense.

CAROLYN

(miserable)

Oh, Lester--

LESTER

Honey, it's okay. I want you to be happy.

(then)

Would you like Smiley Sauce with that?

CAROLYN

Lester, just stop it!

LESTER

Uh-uh. You don't get to tell me what to

do. Ever again.

(CONTINUED)

79.

BUDDY

I'm sorry. I guess we should cool it for

a while. I'm facing a potentially very

expensive divorce.

CAROLYN

Oh, no. I understand completely.

(sarcastic)

In order to be successful, one must

project an image of success. At all

times.

CAROLYN (CONT'D)

Stop it. Stop it!

(CONTINUED)

80.

LESTER

Shit.

RICKY

(getting up)

I have to run next door. Jane left her

geometry book in my bag and she needs it

to do her homework.

ANGELA

So you and psycho boy are fucking on

like, a regular basis now, right?

JANE

(irritable)

No.

ANGELA

Oh, come on. You can tell me. Does he

have a big dick?

JANE

Look, I'm not gonna talk about his dick

with you, okay? It's not like that.

ANGELA

Not like what? Doesn't he have one?

(then)

Why don't you want to talk about it? I

mean, I tell you every single detail

about every guy that I fuck.

(CONTINUED)

81.

JANE

Yeah, and maybe you shouldn't, all right?

Maybe I don't really want to hear all

that.

ANGELA

Oh, so now that you have a boyfriend,

you're like, above it?

(rolls her eyes)

We gotta get you a real man.

RICKY

(grins)

You got any papers?

LESTER

Yeah, in the cigar box, right over there.

(laughs)

You know, put up a fight, dude! You are

such a pushover. "No I can't. Really.

Okay."

RICKY

You should learn to roll a joint.

82.

LESTER

Oh. Hi.

JANE

Where's Mom?

LESTER

Don't know.

ANGELA

Hi, Mr. Burnham.

LESTER

Hi.

ANGELA

Wow. Look at you. Have you been working

out?

LESTER

Some.

ANGELA

You can really tell. Look at those arms.

(CONTINUED)

83.

LESTER

You like muscles?

ANGELA

I--I should probably go see what Jane's

up to.

COLONEL (O.C.)

Where'd you get that?

RICKY

From my job.

COLONEL

Don't lie to me.

(beat)

I saw you with him.

RICKY

(incredulous)

You were watching me?

COLONEL

What did he make you do?

RICKY

(laughs)

Dad, you don't really think... me and Mr.

Burnham?

COLONEL

(furious)

Don't you laugh at me!

(then)

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

84.

COLONEL (CONT'D)

I will not sit back and watch my only son

become a cocksucker!

RICKY

Jesus, what is with you--

COLONEL

I swear to God, I will throw you out of

this house and never look at you again.

RICKY

(taken aback)

You mean that?

COLONEL

Damn straight I do. I'd rather you were

dead than be a fucking faggot.

RICKY

You're right. I suck dick for money.

COLONEL

Boy--

RICKY

Two thousand dollars. I'm that good.

COLONEL

Get out.

RICKY

And you should see me fuck. I'm the best

piece of ass in three states.

COLONEL

(explodes)

Get out!! I don't ever want to see you

again!!

RICKY

What a sad old man you are.

COLONEL

(a whisper)

Get out.

(CONTINUED)

85.

RICKY

Mom, I'm leaving.

BARBARA

Okay, wear a raincoat.

RICKY

(hugs her)

I wish things would have been better for

you. Take care of Dad.

TAPE VOICE

--disinvesting problems of their power,

and removing their ability to make us

afraid. This is the secret to "me-

centered" living.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

86.

TAPE VOICE (CONT'D)

Only by taking full responsibility for

your problems--and their solutions--will

you ever be able to break free from the

constant cycle of victimhood.

TAPE VOICE (CONT'D)

Remember, you are only a victim if you

choose to be a victim...

JANE

I don't think we could be friends

anymore.

ANGELA

You are way too uptight about sex.

JANE

Just don't fuck my dad, all right?

Please?

ANGELA

Why not?

JANE

(angry)

Dad! Leave us alone!

RICKY (O.C.)

It's me.

RICKY (CONT'D)

(to Jane)

If I had to leave tonight, would you come

with me?

JANE

What?

RICKY

If I had to go to New York. To live.

Tonight. Would you come with me?

(CONTINUED)

87.

JANE

Yes.

ANGELA

You guys can't be serious.

(to Jane)

You're just a kid. And he's like, a

mental case. You'll end up living in a

box on the street.

JANE

I'm no more a kid than you are!

( to Ricky)

We can use my plastic surgery money.

RICKY

We won't have to. I have over forty

thousand dollars. And I know people in

the city who can help us get set up.

ANGELA

What, other drug dealers?

RICKY

Yes.

ANGELA

Jane, you'd be out of your mind to go

with him.

JANE

Why do you even care?

ANGELA

Because you're my friend!

RICKY

She's not your friend. She's somebody you

use to feel better about yourself.

ANGELA

Go fuck yourself, psycho!

JANE

You shut up, bitch!

ANGELA

Jane! He is a freak!

(CONTINUED)

88.

JANE

Well, then so am I! And we'll always be

freaks and we'll never be like other

people. And you'll never be a freak

because you're just too perfect.

ANGELA

Oh, yeah? Well, at least I'm not ugly.

RICKY

Yes, you are. And you're boring. And

you're totally ordinary. And you know it.

ANGELA

You two deserve each other.

(CONTINUED)

89.

LESTER

Jesus, man. You're soaked.

LESTER

You want me to get Ricky? He's in Jane's

room.

LESTER (CONT'D)

You okay?

COLONEL

(his voice thick)

Where's your wife?

LESTER

Uh... I don't know. Probably out fucking

that dorky prince of real estate asshole.

And you know what? I don't care.

COLONEL

Your wife is with another man and you

don't care?

LESTER

Nope, our marriage is just for show. A

commercial, for how normal we are. When

we are anything but.

LESTER (CONT'D)

You're shaking.

LESTER (CONT'D)

We really should get you out of these

clothes.

COLONEL

(a whisper)

Yes...

(CONTINUED)

90.

LESTER

It's okay.

COLONEL

(hoarse)

LESTER

(softly)

Just tell me what you need.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry. You got the

wrong idea.

TAPE VOICE

"I refuse to be a victim." When this

becomes your mantra, constantly running

through your head--

CAROLYN

I refuse to be a victim.

91.

ANGELA

I hope you don't mind if I play the

stereo.

LESTER

Not at all.

(then)

Bad night?

ANGELA

Not really bad, just... strange.

LESTER

(grins)

Believe me. It couldn't possibly be any

stranger than mine.

ANGELA

Jane and I had a fight.

(after a beat)

It was about you.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

She's mad at me because I said I think

you're sexy.

LESTER

(offering beer)

Do you want a sip?

(CONTINUED)

92.

LESTER (CONT'D)

So... are you going to tell me? What you

want?

ANGELA

I don't know.

LESTER

You don't know?

ANGELA

What do you want?

LESTER

Are you kidding? I want you. I've wanted

you since the first moment I saw you. You

are the most beautiful thing I have ever

seen.

ANGELA

You don't think I'm ordinary?

LESTER

You couldn't be ordinary if you tried.

ANGELA

Thank you.

(far away)

I don't think there's anything worse than

being ordinary...

CAROLYN

I refuse to be a victim. I refuse to be a

victim. I refuse to be a victim...

(angry)

Lester, I have something I have to say to

you...

93.

JANE

Are you scared?

RICKY

I don't get scared.

JANE

My parents will try to find me.

RICKY

Mine won't.

ANGELA

This is my first time.

LESTER

You're kidding.

ANGELA

(a whisper)

I'm sorry.

(CONTINUED)

94.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

I still want to do it... I just thought I

should tell you... in case you wondered

why I wasn't... better.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

(confused)

What's wrong? I thought you said I was

beautiful.

LESTER

(tenderly)

You are beautiful.

LESTER (CONT'D)

You are so beautiful... and I would be a

very lucky man...

ANGELA

I feel so stupid.

LESTER

Don't.

ANGELA

I'm sorry.

LESTER

You have nothing to be sorry about.

LESTER (CONT'D)

(smiles)

It's okay. Everything's okay.

95.

ANGELA

Wow. I was starving.

LESTER

Do you want me to make you another one?

ANGELA

No, no, no. I'm fine.

LESTER

(concerned)

You sure?

ANGELA

I mean, I'm still a little weirded out,

but...

(sincerely)

...I feel better. Thanks.

LESTER

How's Jane?

ANGELA

What do you mean?

LESTER

I mean, how's her life? Is she happy? Is

she miserable? I'd really like to know,

and she'd die before she'd ever tell me

about it.

(CONTINUED)

96.

ANGELA

She's... she's really happy. She thinks

she's in love.

LESTER

(quietly)

Good for her.

ANGELA

How are you?

LESTER

(smiles, taken aback)

God, it's been a long time since anybody

asked me that.

(thinks about it)

I'm great.

ANGELA

(suddenly)

I've gotta go to the bathroom.

LESTER

(laughs)

I'm great.

(CONTINUED)

97.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Man oh man...

(softly)

Man oh man oh man...

JANE

Oh God.

RICKY

(an awed whisper)

Wow.

LESTER (V.O.)

I had always heard your entire life

flashes in front of your eyes the second

before you die.

LESTER (V.O.)

First of all, that one second isn't a

second at all, it stretches on forever,

like an ocean of time...

98.

LESTER (V.O.)

For me, it was lying on my back at Boy

Scout camp, watching falling stars...

LESTER (V.O.)

And yellow leaves, from the maple trees,

that lined my street...

LESTER (V.O.)

Or my grandmother's hands, and the way

her skin seemed like paper...

(CONTINUED)

99.

LESTER (V.O.)

And the first time I saw my cousin Tony's

brand new Firebird...

LESTER (V.O.)

And Janie...

LESTER (V.O.)

And Janie...

IN BLACK & WHITE:

LESTER (V.O.)

(with love)

And... Carolyn.

100.

LESTER (V.O.)

I guess I could be pretty pissed off

about what happened to me... but it's

hard to stay mad, when there's so much

beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel

like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's

too much, my heart fills up like a

balloon that's about to burst...

LESTER (V.O.)

...and then I remember to relax, and stop

trying to hold on to it, and then it

flows through me like rain and I can't

feel anything but gratitude for every

single moment of my stupid little life...

(amused)

You have no idea what I'm talking about,

I'm sure. But don't worry...

FADE TO BLACK.

LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

You will someday.
