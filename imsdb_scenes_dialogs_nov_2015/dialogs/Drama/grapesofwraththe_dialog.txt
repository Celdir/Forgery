THE GRAPES OF WRATH

"THE GRAPES OF WRATH"

Screenplay

by

Nunnally Johnson

Based on the Novel "The Grapes Of Wrath"

By

John Steinbeck

WAITRESS

When you be back?

DRIVER

Couple a weeks. Don't do nothin' you

wouldn't want me to hear about!

TOM

How about a lift, mister?

DRIVER

Can't you see that sticker?

TOM

Sure I see it. But a good guy don't

pay no attention to what some heel

makes him stick on his truck.

DRIVER

Scrunch down on the running board

till we get around the bend.

DRIVER

Goin' far?

TOM

(shaking his head)

Just a few miles. I'd a walked her

if my dogs wasn't pooped out.

DRIVER

Lookin' for a job?

TOM

No, my old man got a place, forty

acres. He's a sharecropper, but we

been there a long time.

DRIVER

(after a curious glance)

Oh!

DRIVER

Been doin' a job?

TOM

Yeah.

DRIVER

I seen your hands. You been swinging

a pick or a sledge--that shines up

your hands. I notice little things

like that all the time.

(After a pause)

Got a trade?

TOM

(evenly)

Why don't you get to it, buddy?

DRIVER

(uneasily)

Get to what?

TOM

You know what I mean. You been givin'

me a goin' over ever since I got in.

Whyn't you go on and ask me where I

been?

DRIVER

I don't stick my nose in nobody's

business.

TOM

Naw--not much!

DRIVER

(a little frightened)

I stay in my own yard.

TOM

(without emotion)

Listen. That big nose of yours been

goin' over me like a sheep in a

vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin'

it a secret. I been in the

penitentiary. Been there four years.

Like to know anything else?

DRIVER

You ain't got to get sore.

TOM

(coldly)

Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.

DRIVER

I didn't mean nothing.

TOM

Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get

along without shovin' anybody around,

that's all.

(After a pause)

See that road up ahead?

DRIVER

Yeah.

TOM

That's where I get off.

TOM

You're about to bust to know what I

done, ain't you?  Well, I ain't a

guy to let you down.

(Confidentially)

Homicide!

DRIVER

I never asked you!

TOM

(as the truck moves

away)

Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I

hadn't tol' you.

CASY

Mmmmm he's my saviour. Mmmmm my

saviour, Mmmmmmmmmm my saviour now.

(Looking up as Tom

comes down the road)

Howdy, friend.

TOM

Howdy.

CASY

Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol'

Tom's boy?

TOM

(surprised)

Yeah. On my way home now.

CASY

Well, I do declare!

(Grinning)

I baptized you, son.

TOM

(staring)

Why, you're the preacher!

CASY

*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost

the call.

(Reminiscently)

But boy, I sure *used* to have it!

I'd get an irrigation ditch so

squirmin' full of repented sinners I

pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!

(Sighing)

But not no more. I lost the sperit.

TOM

(with a grin)

Pa always said you was never cut out

to be a preacher.

CASY

I got nothin' to preach about no

more--that's all. I ain't so sure o'

things.

TOM

Maybe you should a got yourself a

wife.

CASY

(shakes his head sadly)

At my meetin's I used to get the

girls glory-shoutin' till they about

passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort

'em--and always end up by lovin'

'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an'

pray, but it didn't do no good. Next

time, do it again. I figgered there

just wasn't no hope for me.

TOM

I never let one go by me when I could

catch her.

CASY

But you wasn't a preacher. A girl

was just a girl to you. But to me

they was holy vessels. I was savin'

their souls.

(Fervently)

I ast myself--what *is* this call,

the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love.

Why, I love everybody so much I'm

fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe

there ain't no sin an' there ain't

no virtue. There's just what people

do. Some things folks do is nice,

and some ain't so nice. But that's

as far as any man's got a right to

say.

TOM

(after a moment,

figuring there is no

percentage in

continuing this

philosophical

discussion, pulls

out a flask, which

he extends)

Have a little snort?

CASY

(holding the flask)

Course I'll say grace if somebody

sets out the food--

(shaking his head)

--but my heart ain't in it.

(He takes a long pull)

Nice drinkin' liquor.

TOM

Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor.

Cost me a buck.

CASY

(handing back the

flask)

Been out travelin' around?

TOM

Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.

CASY

No, I never. What?

TOM

I been in the penitentiary for four

years.

(He drinks)

CASY

Excuse me for asking.

TOM

I don't mind any more. I'd do what I

done again. I killed a guy at a dance.

We was drunk. He got a knife in me

and I laid him out with a shovel.

Knocked his head plumb to squash.

CASY

And you ain't ashamed?

TOM

(shaking his head)

He had a knife in me. That's why

they only gave me seven years. Got

out in four--parole.

CASY

Ain't you seen your folks since then?

TOM

(putting on his coat)

No, but I aim to before sundown.

Gettin' kind of excited about it,

too. Which way you going?

CASY

(putting on his sneaker)

It don't matter. Ever since I lost

the sperit it looks like I just as

soon go one way as the other.

(Rising)

I'll go your way.

TOM

Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I

ain't had pork but four times in

four years--every Christmas.

CASY

I'll be glad to see you pa. Last

time I seen him was at a baptizin',

an' he had one a the bigges' doses

of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He

go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin'

like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly

he picks hisself out a bush big as a

piana an' he let out a squawk an'

took a run at that bush. Well, sir,

he cleared her but he bust his leg

snap in two. They was a travellin'

dentist there and he set her, an' I

give her a prayin' over, but they

wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your

pa after that.

TOM

(worriedly)

Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do*

somepin'!

CASY

Shore it is. It always is, this time

a year.

CASY

Is it fur?

TOM

(still looking back)

Just around that next bend.

CASY

(lifting his voice

above the wind)

Your granma was a great one, too.

The third time she got religion she

go it so powerful she knocked down a

full-growed deacon with her fist.

TOM

(pointing ahead)

That's our place.

CASY

(looking back)

And it ain't any too close, either!

We better run!

TOM'S VOICE

Ma?... Pa?... Ain't nobody here?

(After a long silence)

Somepin's happened.

CASY'S VOICE

You got a match?

TOM'S VOICE

There was some pieces of candle always

on a shelf.

TOM

They're all gone--or dead.

CASY

They never wrote you nothing?

TOM

No. They wasn't people to write.

TOM

This was Ma's. Had 'em for years.

TOM

This used to be mine. I give it to

Grampa when I went away.

(To Casy)

You reckon they could be dead?

CASY

I never heard nothin' about it.

MULEY

Tommy?

TOM

(entering)

Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?

MULEY

(dully)

They gone.

TOM

(irritated)

I know that! But *where* they gone?

TOM

(to Casy)

This is Muley Graves.

(To Muley)

You remember the preacher, don't

you?

CASY

I ain't no preacher anymore.

TOM

(impatiently)

All right, you remember the *man*

then.

MULEY AND CASY

Glad to see you again. Glad to see

you.

TOM

(angrily)

Now where is my folks?

MULEY

Gone--

(hastily)

--over to your Uncle John's. The

whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago.

But they can't stay there either,

because John's got *his* notice to

get off.

TOM

(bewildered)

But what's happened?  How come they

got to get off? We been here fifty

years--same place.

MULEY

Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body

leavin', goin' to California. My

folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.

(After a pause)

Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin'

off.

TOM

But who done it?

MULEY

Listen!

(Impatiently Tom

listens to the storm)

That's some of what done it--the

dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin'

like this, year after year--blowin'

the land away, blowin' the crops

away, blowin' us away now.

TOM

(angrily)

Are you crazy?

MULEY

(simply)

Some say I am.

(After a pause)

You want to hear what happened?

TOM

That's what I asked you, ain't it?

MULEY

The way it happens--the way it

happened to me--the man come one

day...

THE MAN

Fact of the matter, Muley, after

what them dusters done to the land,

the tenant system don't work no more.

It don't even break even, much less

show a profit. One man on a tractor

can handle twelve or fourteen of

these places. You just pay him a

wage and take *all* the crop.

MULEY

But we couldn't *do* on any less'n

what our share is now.

(Looking around)

The chillun ain't gettin' enough to

eat as it is, and they're so ragged

we'd be shamed if ever'body else's

chillun wasn't the same way.

THE MAN

(irritably)

I can't help that. All I know is I

got my orders. They told me to tell

you you got to get off, and that's

what I'm telling you.

MULEY

You mean get off my own land?

THE MAN

Now don't go blaming me. It ain't

*my* fault.

SON

Whose fault is it?

THE MAN

You know who owns the land--the

Shawnee Land and Cattle Company.

MULEY

Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle

Comp'ny?

THE MAN

It ain't nobody. It's a company.

SON

They got a pres'dent, ain't they?

They got somebody that knows what a

shotgun's for, ain't they?

THE MAN

But it ain't *his* fault, because

the *bank* tells him what to do.

SON

(angrily)

All right. Where's the bank?

THE MAN

(fretfully)

Tulsa. But what's the use of picking

on him? He ain't anything but the

manager, and half crazy hisself,

trying to keep up with his orders

from the east!

MULEY

(bewildered)

Then who *do* we shoot?

THE MAN

(stepping on the

starter)

Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd

tell you. But I just don't know

*who's* to blame!

MULEY

(angrily)

Well, I'm right here to tell you,

mister, ain't *nobody* going to push

me off *my* land! Grampa took up

this land seventy years ago. My pa

was born here. We was *all* born on

it, and some of us got killed on it,

and some died on it. And that's what

makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and

workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not

no piece of paper with writin' on

it! So just come on and try to push

me off!

TOM

(angrily)

Well?

MULEY

(without emotion)

They come. They come and pushed me

off.

MULEY

They come with the cats.

TOM'S VOICE

The what?

MULEY

The cats--the caterpillar tractors.

MULEY'S VOICE

And for ever' one of 'em ten-fifteen

families gets throwed outa their

homes--one hundred folks with no

place to live but on the road. The

Rances, the Perrys, the Peterses,

the Joadses--one after another they

got throwed out. Half the folks you

and me know--throwed right out into

the road. The one that got me come a

month ago.

MULEY

(shouting)

You come any closer and I'm gonna

blow you right outa that cat!

(He lifts his shotgun)

MULEY

I *tol'* you!

MULEY

Why, you're Joe Davis's boy!

DAVIS

I don't like nobody drawin' a bead

on me.

MULEY

Then what are you doin' this kind a

thing for--against your own people?

DAVIS

For three dollars a day, that's what

I'm doin' it for. I got two little

kids. I got a wife and my wife's

mother. Them people got to eat. Fust

and on'y thing I got to think about

is my own folks. What happens to

other folks is their lookout.

MULEY

But this is *my land*, son. Don't

you understand?

DAVIS

(putting his goggles

back on)

*Used* to be your land. B'longs to

the comp'ny now.

GIRL

What's he fixin' to do, ma?

MA

Hush!

MULEY

(grimly)

Have it your own way, son, but just

as sure as you touch my house with

that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to

kingdom come.

DAVIS

(contemptuously)

You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere.

First place, you'd get hung and you

know it. For another, it wouldn't be

two days before they'd have another

guy here to take my place.

WIFE

Don't! Please don't!

MULEY

I'm tellin' you!

MULEY

(dully)

What was the use. He was right. There

wasn't a thing in the world I could

do about it.

TOM

(bewildered)

But it don't seem possible--kicked

off like that!

MULEY

The rest of my fambly set out for

the west--there wasn't nothin' to

eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin'

wouldn't let me. So now I just wander

around. Sleep wherever I am. I used

to tell myself I was lookin' out for

things, so when they come back

ever'thing would be all right. But I

knowed that wan't true. There ain't

nothin' to look out for. And ain't

nobody comin' back. They're gone--

and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard

ghost--that's all in the world I am.

MULEY

You think I'm touched.

CASY

(sympathetically)

No. You're lonely--but you ain't

touched.

MULEY

It don't matter. If I'm touched, I'm

touched, and that's all there is to

it.

TOM

(still unable to grasp

it all)

What I can't understand is my folks

takin' it! Like ma! I seen her nearly

beat a peddler to death with a live

chicken. She aimed to go for him

with an ax she had in the other hand

but she got mixed up and forgot which

hand was which and when she got

through with that peddler all she

had left was two chicken legs.

MULEY

Just a plain 'ol graveyard ghost,

that's all.

TOM

She's settlin'.

CASY

What you figger to do?

TOM

It's hard to say. Stay here till

mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle

John's, I reckon. After that I don't

know.

MULEY

(grabbing Tom)

Listen!

(Faint sound of motor)

That's them! Them lights! Come on,

we got to hide out!

TOM

(angrily)

Hide out for what? We ain't doin'

nothin'.

MULEY

(terrified)

You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you

lan' no more! An' that's the

supr'tendant--with a gun!

CASY

Come on, Tom. You're on parole.

MULEY

All you got to do is lay down an'

watch.

TOM

(as they lie down)

Won't they come out here?

MULEY

(snickering)

I don't think so. One come out here

once an' I clipped him from behin'

with a fence stake. They ain't

bothered since.

MAN

(in car)

Muley?

(After a pause)

He ain't here.

TOM

Anybody ever 'tol me I'd be hidin'

out on my own place...!

MA'S VOICE

Lord, make us thankful for what we

are about to receive, for His sake.

Amen.

GRANMA

I seen you!--You et durin' grace!

GRAMPA

(indignantly)

One little ole dab!--one teeny little

ole dab!

RUTHIE

(in a snickering

whisper to Winfield)

Ain't he messy though!

GRANMA

(viciously)

I seen him!--gobblin' away like an

ole pig!

GRAMPA

Whyn't you keep your eyes shet durin'

grace, you ole...

NOAH

(who is a half-wit)

What's it say again?

JOHN

Says plenty work in California--

peaches. Eight hundred pickers needed.

GRAMPA

(who has mush on his

mouth)

Wait'll I get to California! Gonna

reach up and pick me an orange

whenever I want it! Or grapes. That

there's somethin' I ain't *never*

had enough of! Gonna get me a whole

bunch a grapes off a bush and I'm

gonna squash 'em all over my face

and just let the juice dreen down

offen my chin!

GRANMA

(in a feeble bleat)

Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory!

GRAMPA

(expanding)

Maybe I get me a whole *washtub*

fulla them grapes and jest sit in

'em and scrooge around till they was

gone!

(Sighing)

I shore would like to do that!

RUTHIE

(whispering)

Look. I'm Grampa!

MA

(softly--her eyes

closed)

Thank God. Oh thank God.

(In sudden terror as

he approaches)

Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya?

You ain't got to hide, have you?

TOM

No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.

MA

I was so scared we was goin' away

without you--and we'd never see each

other again.

TOM

I'd a found you, Ma.

TOM

Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are

we goin' to California true?

MA

We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna

be awright. I seen the han'bills,

about how much work they is, an'

high wages, too. But I gotta fin'

out somepin' else first, Tommy.

(Breathlessly)

Did they hurt you, son? Did they

hurt you an' make you mean-mad?

TOM

(puzzled)

Mad, Ma?

MA

Sometimes they do.

TOM

(gently)

No, Ma I was at first--but not no

more.

MA

(not yet quite

convinced)

Sometimes they do somethin' to you,

Tommy. They hurt you--and you get

mad--and then you get mean--and they

hurt you again--and you get meaner,

and meaner--till you ain't no boy or

no man any more, but just a walkin'

chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you

like that, Tommy?

TOM

(grinning)

No, Ma. You don't have to worry about

that.

MA

Thank God. I--I don't want no mean

son

(She loves him with

her eyes)

PA

(almost to himself)

It's Tommy!

(Then shouting inside)

It's Tommy back!

(Heading for Tom)

What'd you do, son--bust out?

WINFIELD AND RUTHIE

(in an excited chant)

Tom's outa ja-ul! Tom's outa ja-ul!

GRAMPA

I knowed it! Couldn't keep him in!

Can't keep a Joad in! I knowed it

from the fust!

GRANMA

(vaguely)

Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory!

(she resumes eating)

GRAMPA

(to Pa)

You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll

come bustin' outa that jail like a

bull through a corral fence." Can't

keep no Joad in jail!

TOM

(grinning)

I didn't bust out. They lemme out.

Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.

NOAH AND JOHN

Fine, Tommy. Glad to see you.

GRAMPA

(to anybody)

I was the same way myself. Put me in

jail and I'd bust right out. Couldn't

hold me!

NOAH

(confidentially)

Bust out?

TOM

(shaking his head)

Parole.

AL AND ROSASHARN

Hi, Tom! Howya doin'?

TOM

(surprised and pleased)

Rosasharn! Hi, Rosasharn! Howya, Al!

GRAMPA

(wildly)

The jailbird's back! The jailbird's

back!

OMNES

Hi, Ma! Hi, Connie! Hiya, Grampa!

PA

(to Tom)

That's Connie Rivers with her. They're

married now.

(Confidentially)

She's due about three-four months.

TOM

(marveling)

Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when

I went up.

AL

(eagerly as he jumps

down)

You bust outa jail, Tom?

TOM

(patiently)

Naw. They paroled me.

AL

(let down)

Oh.

ROSASHARN

Heh'o Tom.

(Proudly)

This is Connie, my husband.

TOM

(shaking hands)

If this don't beat all!

(Chuckling)

Well, I see you been busy already!

ROSASHARN

(gasping)

You do not see either!--not yet!

OMNES

Lookut his face! Y'see his face?

Lookut Rosasharn! Y'ever see anything

like her face when Tom said it? Look

around, Rosasharn! Let's see it again!

MAN

Hey, Joad! John Joad!

MAN

Ain't forgot, have you?

JOHN

We ain't forgot.

MAN

Comin' through here tomorrow, you

know.

JOHN

I know. We be out. We be out by sunup.

TOM

(to Pa)

How you get all this money?

PA

Sol' things, chopped cotton--even

Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd

dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy-

five for this truck, but we still

got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to

set out on. I figger we oughta be

able to make it on that.

TOM

(dryly)

Easy. After all, they ain't but about

*twelve* of us, is they?

AL

(proudly closing the

hood)

She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf--

but she'll ride!

PA

Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em

out if we aim to get outa here by

daylight. How about it, John? How

you boys comin'?

(He casts a critical

eye over the truck)

TOM

(from the door)

How about it, Ma?

MA

I'm ready.

MA

Rosasharn honey! Wake up the chillun.

We're fixin' to leave.

PA

(as Ma comes out of

the cabin)

Where's Grampa? Al, go git him.

GRANMA

(trying to climb in

the front seat)

I'm gonna sit up front! Somebody

he'p me!

RUTHIE AND WINFIELD

Goin' to California! Goin' to

California!

PA

You kids climb up first, on top.

(all obey as he directs)

Al's gonna drive, Ma. You sit up

there with him and Granma and we'll

swap around later.

GRANMA

I ain't gonna sit with Grampa!

PA

Connie, you he'p Rosasharn up there

alongside Ruthie and Winfiel'.

(Looking around)

Where's Grampa?

GRANMA

(with a cackle)

Where he al'ays is, prob'ly!

PA

Well, leave him a place, but Noah,

you and John, y'all kinda find

yourself a place--kinda keep it even

all around.

TOM

Think she'll hold?

CASY

If she does it'll be a miracle outa

Scripture.

GRAMPA'S VOICE

Lemmo go, gol dang it! Lemmo go, I

tell you!

AL

He wasn't sleepin'. He was settin'

out back a the barn. They's somepin'

wrong with him.

GRAMPA

Ef you don't let me go--

TOM

What's the matter, Grampa?

GRAMPA

(dully, sullenly)

Ain't nothin' the matter. I just

ain't a-goin', that's all.

PA

What you mean you ain't goin'? We

*got* to go. We got no place to stay.

GRAMPA

I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin'

about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give

her a good goin' over all night long--

and I'm a-stayin'.

PA

But you can't *do* that, Grampa.

This here land is goin' under the

tractor. We *all* got to git out.

GRAMPA

All but me! I'm a-stayin'.

TOM

How 'bout Granma?

GRAMPA

(fiercely)

Take her with you!

MA

(getting out of the

truck)

But who'd cook for you? How'd you

live?

GRAMPA

Muley's livin', ain't he? And I'm

*twicet* the man Muley is!

PA

(on his knee)

Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me,

just a minute.

GRAMPA

(grimly)

And I ain't gonna listen either. I

tol' you what I'm gonna do.

(Angrily)

And I don't give a hoot in a hollow

if they's oranges and grapes crowdin'

a fella outa bed even, I ain't a-

goin' to California!

(Picking up some dirt)

This here's my country. I b'long

*here*.

(Looking at the dirt)

It ain't no good--

(after a pause)

--but it's mine.

TOM

(after a silence)

Ma. Pa.

(They move toward the

cabin with him)

Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and

frightened and bewildered, scratches

in the dirt.

GRAMPA

(loudly)

And can't nobody *make* me go, either!

Ain't nobody here *man* enough to

make me! I'm a-stayin'.

TOM

Either we got to tie him up and

*throw* him on the truck, or somepin.

He can't stay here.

PA

Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him

or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his

self.

(After thought)

Reckon we could git him *drunk*?

TOM

Ain't no whisky, is they?

MA

Wait. There's a half a bottle a

soothin' sirup here.

(In the trash in the

corner)

It put the chillun to sleep.

TOM

(tasting it)

Don't taste bad.

MA

(looking in the pot)

And they's some coffee here. I could

fix him a cup...

TOM

That's right. And douse some in it.

PA

(watching)

Better give him a good 'un. He's

awful bull-headed.

GRAMPA

(mumbling defiantly)

If Muley can scrabble along, I can

do it too.

(Suddenly sniffing)

I smell spareribs. Somebody been

eatin' spareribs? How come I ain't

got some?

MA

(from the door)

Got some saved for you, Grampa. Got

'em warmin' now. Here's a cuppa

coffee.

GRAMPA

(taking the cup)

Awright, but get me some a them

spareribs, too. Get me a whole mess

of 'em. I'm hongry.

GRAMPA

(amiably)

I shore do like spareribs.

PA

(fretfully)

Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his

head wide open? Pull his arms, John.

GRAMPA

(mumbling)

Ain't a-goin', thas all...

PA

Put somepin' over him, so he won't

git sun-struck.

(Looking around)

Ever'body set now?

(A chorus of responses)

Awright, Al, letta go!

PA

You be awright, Grampa.

CASY

Good-by, an' good luck.

PA

Hey, wait! Hold 'er, Al!

(The car stops)

Ain't you goin' with us?

CASY

(after a pause)

I'd like to. There's somethin'

happenin' out there in the wes' an'

I'd like to try to learn what it is.

If you feel you got the room...

PA

(heartily)

Come on, get on, plenty room!

OMNES

Sure, come on, Casy, plenty room!

PA

(excitedly)

Here we go!

TOM

(grinning)

California, here we come!

AL

(grinning)

Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give

the ol' place a last look?

MA

(coldly shaking her

head)

We're goin' to California, ain't we?

Awright then, let's *go* to

California.

AL

(sobering)

That don't sound like you, Ma. You

never was like that before.

MA

I never had my house pushed over

before. I never had my fambly stuck

out on the road. I never had to

lose... ever'thing I had in life.

GRAMPA

*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...

TOM

'S all right, Grampa. You just kind

a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a

pallet.

GRAMPA

(a whisper)

Thas it, jus' tar'd thas all... jus'

tar'd...

(He closes his eyes)

TOM'S VOICE

This here is William James Joad,

dyed of a stroke, old old man. His

folkes bured him becaws they got no

money to pay for funerls. Nobody

kilt him. Jus a stroke an he dyed.

TOM

I figger best we leave something

like this on him, lest somebody dig

him up and make out he been kilt.

(Reaching into the

grave)

Lotta times looks like the gov'ment

got more interest in a dead man than

a live one.

PA

Not be so lonesome, either, knowin'

his name is there with 'im, not just'

a old fella lonesome underground.

TOM

(straightening up)

Casy, won't you say a few words?

CASY

I ain't no more a preacher, you know.

TOM

We know. But ain't none of our folks

ever been buried without a few words.

CASY

(after a pause)

I'll say 'em--an' make it short.

(All bow and close

eyes)

This here ol' man jus' lived a life

an' jus' died out of it. I don't

know whether he was good or bad, an'

it don't matter much. Heard a fella

say a poem once, an' he says, "All

that lives is holy." But I wouldn't

pray for jus' a ol' man that's dead,

because he's awright. If I was to

pray I'd pray for the folks that's

alive an' don't know which way to

turn. Grampa here, he ain't got no

more trouble like that. He's got his

job all cut out for 'im--so cover

'im up and let 'im get to it.

OMNES

Amen.

MA

Tommy.

TOMMY

What is it, Ma?

MA

Wasn't that the state line we just

passed?

TOM

(after a pause)

Yes'm, that was it.

MA

Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to

cross it if you're paroled. Says

they'll send you up again.

TOM

Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered

out. Long as I keep outa trouble,

ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All

I gotta do is keep my nose clean.

MA

(worriedly)

Maybe they got crimes in California

we don't know about. Crimes we don't

even know *is* crimes.

TOM

(laughing)

Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the

nice things out there. Think about

them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body

got work--

GRANMA

(waking suddenly)

I gotta git out!

TOM

First gas station, Granma--

GRANMA

I gotta git *out*, I tell ya! I gotta

git *out*!

TOM

(foot on brakes)

Awright! Awright!

TOM

They shore don't waste no time!

(As Granma whines)

Take her out.

COP

(astraddle his

motorcycle)

Save your strength, lady.

(to Tom)

Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.

TOM

(relieved)

We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a

minute--

COP

Lissen, I heard that before--

GRANMA

I tell ya I gotta git out!

TOM

(mildly)

She's kinda ol'--

GRANMA

(whimpering)

I tell ya--

COP

Okay, okay!

GRANMA

(triumphantly)

Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory!

ROSASHARN

Ma... all this, will it hurt the

baby?

MA

Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.

ROSASHARN

Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.

MA

Well, can't nobody get through nine

*months* without sorrow.

ROSASHARN

But will it--hurt the baby?

MA

They use' to be a sayin': A chile

born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile.

An' another: Born outa too much joy'll

be a doleful boy. That's the way I

always heard it.

ROSASHARN

You don't ever get scairt, do you,

Ma?

MA

(thoughtfully)

Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't

scairt so much. It's just waitin'

an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens

that I got to do sump'n--

(simply)

--I'll do it.

ROSASHARN

Don't it ever scare you it won't be

nice in California like we think?

MA

(quickly)

No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I

can't let m'self. All I can do is

see how soon they gonna wanta eat

again. They'd all get upset if I

done anymore 'n that. They all depen'

on me jus' thinkin' about that.

(After a pause)

That's my part--that an' keepin' the

fambly together.

PA

(with quiet pride)

Thas my son-in-law.

FIRST MAN

Sings real nice. What state y'all

from?

PA

Oklahoma. Had us a farm there, share-

croppin'.

TOM

Till the tractors druv us out.

FIRST MAN

We from Arkansas. I had me a store

there, kind of general notions store,

but when the farms went the store

went too.

(Sighing)

Nice a little as you ever saw. I

shore did hate to give it up.

PA

(profoundly)

Wal, y'cain't tell. I figure when we

git out there an' git work an' maybe

git us a piece a growin' lan' near

water it might not be so bad at that.

OTHER MEN

Thas right... Payin' good wages, I

hear... Ever'body got work out

there... Can't be no worse...

SECOND MAN

You folks must have a pot a money.

PA

(with dignity)

No, we ain't got no money. But they's

plenty of us to work, an' we 're all

good men. Get good wages out there

an' put it all together an' we'll be

awright.

SECOND MAN

Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an'

peaches?

PA

(quietly)

We gonna take whatever they got.

TOM

What's so funny about it?

SECOND MAN

(sniggering again)

What's so funny about it?  I just

*been* out there! I been an' *seen*

it! An' I'm goin' *back* to starve--

because I ruther starve all over at

once!

PA

(angrily)

Whatta you think you're talkin' about?

I got a han'bill here says good wages,

an' I seen it in the papers they

need pickers!

SECOND MAN

Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin'

ya!

PA

(pulling out handbill)

But what about this?

SECOND MAN

I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!

TOM

Wait a minute, buddy. You jus' done

some jackassin'! You ain't gonna

shut up now. The han'bill says they

need men. You laugh an' say they

don't. Now which one's a liar?

SECOND MAN

(after a pause)

How many you'all got them han'bills?

Come on, how many?

PA

But what does *that* prove?

SECOND MAN

Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill--

800 pickers wanted. Awright, this

man wants 800 men. So he prints up

5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe

20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe

two-three thousan' starts movin,

wes' account a this han'bill. Two-

three thousan' folks that's crazy

with worry headin' out for 800 jobs!

Does that make sense?

PROPRIETOR

What are you, a troublemaker? You

sure you ain't one a them labor fakes?

SECOND MAN

I swear I ain't, mister!

PROPRIETOR

Well, don't you go roun' here tryin'

to stir up trouble.

SECOND MAN

(drawing himself up)

I tried to tell you folks sump'n it

took me a year to fin' out. Took two

kids dead, took my wife dead, to

show me. But nobody couldn't tell me

neither. I can't tell ya about them

little fellas layin' in the tent

with their bellies puffed out an'

jus' skin on their bones, an'

shiverin' an' whinin' like pups, an'

me runnin' aroun' tryin' to get work--

(shouting)

--not for money, not for wages--jus'

for a cup a flour an' a spoon a lard!

An' then the coroner came. "Them

children died a heart-failure," he

says, an' put it in his paper.

(With wild bitterness)

Heart-failure!--an' their little

bellies stuck out like a pig-bladder!

FIRST MAN

Well--gettin' late. Got to get to

sleep.

PA

S'pose he's tellin' the truth--that

fella?

CASY

He's tellin' the truth awright. The

truth for him. He wasn't makin'

nothin' up.

TOM

How about us? Is that the truth for

us?

CASY

I don't know.

PA

(worriedly)

How can you tell?

FAT MAN

(truculently)

You folks aim to buy anything?

AL

Need some gas, mister.

FAT MAN

Got any money?

AL

Whatta you think:--we's beggin'?

FAT MAN

I just ast, that's all.

TOM

(evenly)

Well, ask right. You ain't talkin'

to bums, you know.

FAT MAN

(appealing to heaven)

All in the worl' I done was ast!

BILL

Kinda pie y'got?

MAE

Banana cream, pineapple cream,

chocolate cream--and apple.

BILL

Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream,

and a cuppa java.

FRED

Make it two.

MAE

Two it is.

(Smirking)

Seen any new etchin's lately, Bill?

BILL

(grinning)

Well, here's one ain't bad. Little

kid comes in late to school. Teacher

says--

MAE

Yeah?

PA

Could you see your way clear to sell

us a loaf of bread, ma'am.

MAE

This ain't a groc'ry store. We got

bread to make san'widges with.

PA

I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole

lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with

water so she can chew it, an' she's

hongry.

MAE

Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got

nice san'widges.

PA

(embarrassed)

I shore would like to do that, ma'am,

but the fack is, we ain't got but a

dime for it. It's all figgered out,

I mean--for the trip.

MAE

You can't get no loaf a bread for a

dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.

BERT

(an angry whisper)

Give 'em the bread.

MAE

We'll run out 'fore the bread truck

comes.

BERT

Awright then, run out!

MAE

Come in.

MAE

This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.

PA

Would you--could you see your way to

cuttin' off ten cents worth?

BERT

(a clinched teeth

order)

Give 'im the loaf!

PA

No, sir, we wanta buy ten cents worth,

thas all.

MAE

(sighing)

You can have this for ten cents.

PA

I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.

MAE

(with resignation)

Go ahead--Bert says take it.

PA

May soun' funny to be so tight, but

we got a thousan' miles to go, an'

we don't know if we'll make it.

PA

Is them penny candy, ma'am?

MAE

Which ones?

PA

There, them stripy ones.

MAE

Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for

a penny.

PA

Well, give me two then, ma'am.

PA

(beaming)

Sure, take 'em, take 'em!

PA

Thank you, ma'am.

BILL

Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.

MAE

(belligerently)

What's it to you?

BILL

Them was nickel apiece candy.

FRED

We got to get goin'. We're droppin'

time.

BILL

So long.

MAE

Hey, wait a minute. You got change

comin'.

BILL'S VOICE

(from outside)

What's it to you?

MAE

(softly)

Bert.

BERT

(playing a machine)

What ya want?

MAE

Look here.

MAE

(reverently)

Truck drivers.

BERT

I figgered No. 3 was about ready to

pay off.

GUARD

Where you going?

TOM

(who is driving)

California.

GUARD

How long you plan to be in Arizona?

TOM

No longer'n we can get acrost her.

GUARD

Got any plants?

TOM

No plants.

GUARD

(putting sticker on

windshield)

Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep

movin'.

TOM

Sure. We aim to.

PA

(finally)

There she is, folks--the land a milk

an' honey--California!

CONNIE

(sullenly)

Well, if *that's* what we come out

here for...

ROSASHARN

(timidly, to Connie)

Maybe it's nice on the other side.

Them pitchers--them little pos'cards--

they was real pretty.

TOM

(rallying them)

Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of

it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt

right off.

PA

Course not. Come on, let's get goin'.

She don't look so tough to me!

TOM

Got that desert yet. Gotta take her

tonight. Take her in the daytime

fella says she'll cut your gizzard

out.

PA

(to Al)

How's Granma since we got her in the

tent?

AL

She's off her chump, seems to me.

NOAH

She's outa her senses, awright. All

night on the truck keep talkin' like

she was talkin' to Grampa.

TOM

She's jus' wore out, that's all.

PA

(worriedly)

I shore would like to stop here a

while an' give her some res' but we

on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I

won't feel right till we're there

an' all workin' an' a little money

comin' in.

NOAH

(lazily, after a

silence)

Like to jus' stay here myself. Like

to lay here forever. Never get hungry

an' never get sad. Lay in the water

all life long, lazy as a brood sow

in the mud.

TOM

(looking up at the

mountains)

Never seen such tough mountains.

This here's a murder country, just

the *bones* of a country.

(Thoughtfully)

Wonder if we'll ever get in a place

where folks can live 'thout fightin'

hard scrabble an' rock. Sometimes

you get to thinkin' they *ain't* no

such country.

MAN

How's the swimmin'?

TOM

Dunno. We ain't tried none. Sure

feels good to set here, though.

MAN

Mind if we come in an' set?

TOM

She ain't our river. But we'll len'

you a little piece of her.

PA

Goin' west?

MAN'S VOICE

Nope. We come from there. Goin' back

home.

TOM

Where's home?

MAN'S VOICE

Panhandle, come from near Pampa.

PA

(in surprise)

Can you make a livin' there?

MAN'S VOICE

Nope.

MAN

(continuing)

But at leas' we can starve to death

with folks we know.

PA

(slowly)

Ya know, you're the second fella

talked like that. I'd like to hear

some more about that.

TOM

Me an' you both.

SON

(finally)

He ain't gonna tell you nothin' about

it.

PA

If a fella's willin' to work hard,

can't he cut her?

MAN

Listen, mister. I don't know

ever'thing. You might go out an'

fall into a steady job, an' I'd be a

liar. An' then, you might never get

no work, an' I didn't warn you. All

I can tell ya, most of the folks is

purty mis'able.

(Sullenly)

But a fella don't know ever'thing.

PA

John, you never was a fella to say

much, but I'll be goldanged if you

opened your mouth twicet since we

lef' home. What you think about this?

JOHN

(scowling)

I don't think *nothin'* about it.

We're a-goin' there, ain't we?  When

we get there, we'll get there. When

we get a job, we'll work, an' when

we don't get a job we'll set on our

behin's. That's all they is to it,

ain't it?

TOM

(laughing)

Uncle John don't talk much but when

he does he shore talks sense.

(He spurts water out

of his mouth)

FIRST BOY

You people got a lotta nerve.

TOM

What you mean?

FIRST BOY

Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like

this.

TOM

You been acrost?

FIRST BOY

Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck

like this.

TOM

If we broke down maybe somebody'd

give us a han'.

FIRST BOY

(doubtfully)

Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin'

it. Takes more nerve than I got.

TOM

(laughing)

It don't take no nerve to do somep'n

when there ain't nothin' else you

can do.

(He climbs into the

driver's seat)

MA

(softly)

Don't you worry, Granma. It's gonna

be awright.

GRANMA

(mumbling)

Grampa... Grampa... I want Grampa...

MA

Don't you fret now.

FIRST BOY

Holy Moses, what a hard-lookin'

outfit!

SECOND BOY

All them Okies is hard-lookin'.

FIRST BOY

Boy, but I'd hate to hit that desert

in a jalopy like that!

SECOND BOY

(contentedly)

Well, you and me got sense. Them

Okies got no sense or no feeling.

They ain't human. A human being

wouldn't live like they do. A human

being couldn't stand it to be so

miserable.

FIRST BOY

Just don't know any better, I guess.

AL

What a place! How'd you like to walk

acrost her?

TOM

People done it. If they could, we

could.

AL

Lots must a died, too.

TOM

(after a pause)

Well, we ain't out a it yet.

RUTHIE

This here's the desert an' we're

right in it!

WINFIELD

(trying to see)

I wisht it was day.

RUTHIE

Tom says if it's day it'll cut you

gizzard smack out a you.

(Trying to see too)

I seen a pitcher once. They was bones

ever'place.

WINFIELD

Man bones?

RUTHIE

Some, I guess, but mos'ly cow bones.

MA

(whispering)

'S awright, honey. Everything's gonna

be awright.

ROSASHARN

Seems like we wasn't never gonna do

nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.

CONNIE

(sullenly)

Women is always tar'd.

ROSASHARN

(fearfully)

You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you,

honey?

CONNIE

(slowly)

No, but--but you seen that

advertisement in the Spicy Western

Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'.

Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're

a radio expert--nice clean work.

ROSASHARN

(pleadingly)

But we can still do it, honey.

CONNIE

(sullenly)

I ought to done it then--an' not

come on any trip like this.

MA

(whispering)

We can't give up, honey. The family's

got to get acrost. You know that.

JOHN'S VOICE

Ever'thing all right?

MA

(slowly)

Yes, ever'thing's all right. I--I

guess I dropped off to sleep.

TOM

What's this here?

OFFICER

Agricultural inspection. We got to

go over your stuff. Got any vegetables

or seed?

TOM

No.

OFFICER

Well, we got to look over your stuff.

You got to unload.

MA

Look, mister. We got a sick ol' lady.

We got to get her to a doctor. We

can't wait.

(Almost hysterically)

You can't make us wait!

OFFICER

Yeah? Well, we got to look you over.

MA

I swear we ain't got anything. I

swear it. An' Granma's awful sick.

(Pulling him to the

truck)

Look!

OFFICER

(shocked)

You wasn't foolin'! You swear you

got no fruit or vegetables?

MA

No, I swear it.

OFFICER

Then go ahead. You can get a doctor

at Barstow. That's just eight miles.

But don't stop. Don't get off.

Understand?

TOM

Okay, cap. Much oblige.

MA

(to John)

Tell Tom he don't have to stop.

Granma's all right.

AL

Will ya look at her!

PA

(shaking his head)

I never knowed they was anything

like her!

TOM

Where's Ma? I want Ma to see it.

Look, Ma! Come here, Ma!

TOM

(shocked)

Ma, you sick?

MA

(hoarsely)

Ya say we're acrost?

TOM

(eagerly)

Look, Ma!

MA

Thank God!  An' we're still together--

most of us.

(Her knees buckle and

she sits down on the

running board)

TOM

Didn' you get no sleep?

MA

No.

TOM

Was Granma bad?

MA

(after a pause)

Granma's dead.

TOM

(shocked)

When?

MA

Since before they stopped us las'

night.

TOM

An' that's why you didn't want 'em

to look?

MA

(nodding)

I was afraid they'd stop us an'

wouldn't let us cross. But I tol'

Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'.

I tol' her the fambly had ta get

acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take

no chances on bein' stopped.

MA

(softly)

So it's all right. At leas' she'll

get buried in a nice green place.

Trees and flowers aroun'.

(Smiling sadly)

She got to lay her head down in

California after all.

POLICEMAN

How far you figger you gonna get

*this* way?

TOM

Right here. We give out a gas.

TOM

Where's the bes' place to get some

work aroun' here?

(Pulling out the

handbill)

Don't matter what kin' either.

POLICEMAN

(patiently)

If I seen one a them things I must a

seen ten thousan'.

PA

Ain't it no good?

POLICEMAN

(shaking his head)

Not here--not now. Month ago there

was some pickin' but it's all moved

south now. Where'bouts in Oklahoma

you from?

TOM

Sallisaw.

POLICEMAN

I come out from Cherokee County--two

years ago.

ROSASHARN

(pleased)

Why, Connie's folks from Cherokee

County--

POLICEMAN

(stopping her wearily)

Okay, ma'am, let's don't go into it.

I already met about a hundred firs'

cousins an' it mus' be five hundred

secon'. But this is what I got to

tell you, don't try to park in town

tonight. Keep on out to that camp.

If we catch you in town after dark

we got to lock you up. Don't forget.

PA

(worriedly)

But what we gonna *do*?

POLICEMAN

(about to leave)

Pop, that just ain't up to me.

(Grimly he points to

the handbill)

But I don't min' tellin' you, the

guy they *ought* to lock up is the

guy that sent out *them* things.

ATTENDANT

(brightly)

How many, folks?

AL

(after a pause)

One.

TOM

(shaking his head)

She shore don't look prosperous.

Want to go somewheres else?

MA

On a gallon a gas?

(As Tom grins at her)

Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can

fix us up some stew.

GIRL

(shyly)

I could break up some bresh if you

want me, ma'am.

MA

(gently)

You want to get ast to eat, hunh?

GIRL

(simply)

Yes, ma'am.

MA

Didn' you have no breakfast?

GIRL

No, ma'am. They ain't no work

hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell

some stuff to get gas so's we can

get along.

MA

Didn' none of these have no breakfast?

BOY

(boastfully)

I did. Me an' my brother did. We et

good.

MA

Then you ain't hungry, are you?

BOY

(doggedly)

We et good.

(Then he breaks and

runs)

MA

Well, it's a good thing *some* a you

ain't hungry, because they ain't

enough to go all the way roun'.

GIRL

Aw, he was braggin'. Know what he

done? Las' night, come out an' say

they got chicken to eat. Well, sir,

I looked in whilst they was a-eatin'

an' it was fried dough jus' like

ever'body else.

PA

How 'bout it?

MA

(to Ruthie)

Go get Tom an' Al.

(looking helplessly

at the children)

I dunno what to do. I got to feed

the fambly. What'm I gonna do with

these here?

JOHN

(standing up)

You take this.

(Handing plate to Tom)

I ain't hungry.

TOM

Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.

JOHN

I know, but I got a stomickache. I

ain't hungry.

TOM

(after a glance at

the children)

You take that plate inside the tent

an' you eat it.

JOHN

Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see

'em inside the tent.

TOM

(to the children)

You git. Go on now, git. You ain't

doin' no good. They ain't enough for

you.

MA

We can't send 'em away. Take your

plates an' go inside. Take a plate

to Rosasharn.

(Smiling, to the

children)

Look. You little fellas go an' get

you each a flat stick an' I'll put

what's lef' for you.

(The children scatter)

But they ain't to be no fightin'!

(Dishing plates for

Ruthie and Winfield)

I don't know if I'm doin' right or

not but--go inside, ever'body stay

inside.

(The children are

back)

They ain't enough. All you gonna get

is jus' a taste but--I can't help

it, I can't keep it from you.

MA

(bitterly)

I done fine! Now nobody got enough!

AGENT

You men want to work?

PA

Sure we wanta work. Where's it at?

AGENT

Tulare County. Fruit's opening up.

Need a lot of pickers.

FLOYD

You doin' the hirin'?

AGENT

Well, I'm contracting the land.

FIRST MAN

Whay you payin?

AGENT

Well, can't tell exactly, yet. 'Bout

thirty cents, I guess.

FIRST MAN

Why can't you tell? You took the

contrac', didn' you?

AGENT

That's true. But it's keyed to the

price. Might be a little more, might

be a little less.

FLOYD

(quietly)

All right, mister. I'll go. You just

show your license to contrack, an'

then you make out a order--where an'

when an' how much you gonna pay--an'

you sign it an' we'll go.

AGENT

(ominously)

You trying to tell me how to run my

own business?

FLOYD

'F we're workin' for you, it's our

business too. An' how do we know--

(pulling out a handbill)

--you ain't one a the guys that sent

these things out?

AGENT

(tough)

Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my

business my own way. I got work. If

you wanta take it, okay. If not,

just sit here, that's all.

FLOYD

Twicet now I've fell for that line.

Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he

get's five thousan' there, an' he'll

pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you

guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll

be hungry.

(Facing the agent)

'F he wants to hire men, let him

write it out an' say what he's gonna

pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't

allowed by law to contrack men without

a license.

AGENT

(turning)

Joe!

FLOYD

(angrily)

You see? If this guy was on the level,

would he bring a cop along?

DEPUTY

(entering)

What's the trouble?

AGENT

(pointing at Floyd)

Ever see this guy before?

DEPUTY

What'd he do?

AGENT

He's agitatin'.

DEPUTY

Hmmm.

(Giving Floyd a looking

over)

Seems like I have. Seems like I seen

him hangin' around that used car lot

that was busted into. Yep, I'd swear

it's the same fella.

(Sharply)

Get in that car.

TOM

You got nothin' on him.

DEPUTY

Open your trap again and you'll go

too.

AGENT

(to the men)

You fellas don't wanta lissen to

troublemakers. You better pack up

an' come on to Tulare County.

DEPUTY

Might be a good idea to do what he

says. Too many of you Okies aroun'

here already. Folks beginnin' to

figger it ain't maybe *safe*. Might

start a epidemic or sump'n.

(After a pause)

Wouldn't like a bunch a guys down

here with pick handles tonight, would

you?

DEPUTY

(to Floyd)

Now, you.

CASY

Gimme that gun. Now git outa here.

Go down in them willows an' wait.

TOM

(angrily)

I ain't gonna run.

CASY

He seen you, Tom! You wanta be

fingerprinted? You wanta get sent

back for breakin' parole?

TOM

You're right!

CASY

Hide in the willows. If it's awright

to come back I'll give you four high

whistles.

CASY

Go on. Get in your tent. You don't

know nothin'.

AL

How 'bout you?

CASY

(grinning)

*Some*body got to take the blame.

They just *got* to hang it on

somebody, you know.

(Shrugging)

An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set

around.

AL

But ain't no reason--

CASY

(savagely)

Lissen. I don't care nothin' about

you, but if you mess in this, your

whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble,

an' Tom get sent back to the

penitentiary.

AL

Okay. I think you're a darn fool,

though.

CASY

Sure. Why not?

SECOND DEPUTY

What's goin' on here?

CASY

This man a yours, he got tough an' I

hit him. Then he started shootin'--

hit a woman down the line--so I hit

him again.

SECOND DEPUTY

Well--what'd you do in the first

place?

CASY

I talked back.

CASY

They's a woman down there like to

bleed to death from his bad shootin'.

SECOND DEPUTY

(to assistant)

Take a look at her.

(To deputy)

Mike, is this the fella that hit

you?

DEPUTY

(dazedly)

Don't look like him.

CASY

It was me, all right. You just got

smart with the wrong fella.

DEPUTY

(shuddering)

Don't look like him, but... maybe it

was. I ain't sure.

SECOND DEPUTY

Get in that car.

MAN

(proudly)

Boy, what a mess a .45 does make!

They got a tourniquet on. We'll send

a doctor out.

DEPUTY

(angry at the whole

business)

But what you gonna do? Must be

*thousands* of 'em around here, sore

and hungry and living in them dumps.

What you gonna do about 'em?

SECOND DEPUTY

You gotta hold 'em down. Hold 'em

down or they'll take over the whole

country. That's all you *can* do.

DEPUTY

(grimly)

Well, they ain't gonna take over

*my* country. I been livin' here too

long for *that*. Maybe some a the

boys better drop around tonight and

give 'em something to think about.

PA

(to Ma)

Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy-

goatin' around--

AL

Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up

with a couple girls I know.

MA

You don't know *no* girls around

here. You're lyin', *You're runnin'

away*!

PA

(a short flash of

momentary but ill

advised belligerence)

Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--

MA

(softly, as she picks

up jack-handle)

You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come

on an' whup me. Jus' try it.

PA

(solemnly)

Now don't get sassy, Ma.

MA

Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna

*tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.

(Hefting the jack-

handle)

An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta

whup me first. So some on.

PA

(helplessly)

I never *seen* her so sassy.

(With a touch of

bewildered pride)

An' she ain't so young, neither!

AL

(sullenly)

I'd come back--

MA

(eyes on Pa)

But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you

better not ever go to sleep again,

because the minute you go to sleep,

or you're settin' down, or your back's

turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up

with a bucket.

PA

(helplessly)

Jus' sassy, that's all.

MA

(angrily)

Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and

tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up.

All we got lef' in the *worl'* is

the fambly--an' right down at bottom

that's all we *got* to have! Ef some

of us dies, we can't he'p that--but

ain't nobody else runnin' away!

AL

But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I

wanta do is go away with another

fella an' look aroun' for work by

ourself--

MA

(blazing)

Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't

*nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here

an' we gonna *stay* here, together!

As long as we got the fambly unbroke

I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter

road we got ahead of us--

(squaring off)

--an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody

else tries to bust us up anymore I'm

a-goin' cat wild with this here piece

a bar-arn!

TOM

Hey, Al!

AL

(peering into the

darkness)

Tom? You can come on. They gone.

TOM

(entering quickly)

We got to get outa here right away.

Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?

JOHN

(from tent)

Here I am.

PA

What's a matter now?

TOM

Fella tells me some a them poolroom

boys figgerin' to burn the whole

camp out tonight. Got to get that

truck loaded--what you doin' with

the jack-handle, Ma?

MA, PA, AND AL

(together)

Al's tryin' to go away... She jus'

got sassy... All I aimed to do...

TOM

(taking the jack-handle)

Awright, you can fight it out later.

Right now we got to hustle. Where's

Connie?

MA

(quietly)

Connie's gone.

(Indicating Rosasharn)

Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't

know it was gonna be like this.

PA

(angrily)

Glad to get shet of him. Never was

no good an' never will be--

MA

Pa! Shh!

PA

How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't

he?

TOM

(looking to Rosasharn)

Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the

truck.

(He kneels beside

Rosasharn. Gently)

Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be

awright.

ROSASHARN

(uncovering her face)

Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin'

a tall. Without him I jus' don't

wanta live.

TOM

Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave

word for him. Jus' don't cry.

(He pats her awkwardly)

TOM

Just in case. Sit up back an' if

anybody tries to climb up--let 'im

have it.

PA

(from truck)

I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.

TOM

(to Al)

Give 'im a fryin' pan.

(He gets into the

driver's seat and

starts the truck)

ROSASHARN

(hopefully)

Maybe Connie went to get some books

to study up with. He's gonna be a

radio expert, ya know. Maybe he

figgered to suprise us.

MA

Maybe that's jus' what he done.

TOM

Ma, they comes a time when a man

gets mad.

MA

Tom--you tol' me--you promised you

wasn't like that. You promised me.

TOM

I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was

the law they was workin' with, we

could take it. But it *ain't* the

law. They're workin' away at our

spirits. They're tryin' to make us

cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on

our decency.

MA

You promised, Tommy.

TOM

I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.

MA

You gotta keep clear, Tom. The

fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to

keep clear.

TOM

What's that--detour?

LEADER

Where you think you're goin'?

TOM

Well--

(then in a servile

whine)

--we're strangers here. We heard

about they's work in a place called

Tulare.

LEADER

Well, you're goin' the wrong way,

an' what's more, we don't want no

more Okies in this town. We ain't

got work enough for them that are

already here.

TOM

Which way is it at, mister?

LEADER

You turn right aroun' and head north.

An' don't come back till the cotton's

ready.

TOM

Yes, sir.

MA

(whispering)

Don't you min', Tommy. You done good.

You done jus' good.

MA

(thoughtfully)

Sump'n got to happen soon. We got

one day's more grease, two day's

flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...

(Looking at Rosasharn)

An' Rosasharn, we got to remember

she's gonna be due soon.

PA

(shaking his head)

It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get

enough to eat.

TOM

Fella tells me they's three hunerd

thousan' aroun' here like us, a-

scrabblin' for work an' livin' like

hogs. Can't figger what it is, but

*sump'n's* wrong.

SPENCER

Morning.

TOM

Morning.

SPENCER

You people looking for work?

TOM

Mister, we're lookin' even under

boards for work.

SPENCER

Can you pick peaches?

TOM

We can pick anything.

SPENCER

Well, there's plenty of work for you

about forty miles north, this road

just outside Pixley. Turn east on 32

and look for Hooper's ranch. Tell

'em Spencer sent you.

TOM

Mister, we sure that ya!

MA

(excitedly)

Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause

ever'body been wantin' that, an'

then some flour an' bakin' powder

an' meat. Better not get no side-

meat right off. Save that for later.

Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap

too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to

have some milk.

TOM

Get some sugar too, for the coffee.

MA

You know, I jus' can't remember when

I felt so good before!

AL

Know what I'm a-gonna do? I'm a-gonna

save up an' go in town an' get me a

job in a garage. Live in a room an'

eat in restaurants. Go to the movin'

pitchers *ever'* night. Cowboy

pitchers.

AL

What is it, a wreck?

COP

(on motorcycle)

Where you think you're going?

TOM

Fella named Spencer sent us--said

they was work pickin' peaches.

COP

Want to work, do you?

TOM

Sure do.

COP

Pull up behind that car.

(Calling)

Okay for this one. Take 'em through.

TOM

(the truck moving)

What's the matter? What's happened?

COP

Little trouble up ahead, but you'll

get through. Just follow the line.

AL

Maybe the road's out.

TOM

I don't know what these cops got to

do with it but I don't like it.

(Looking out)

An' these here are our own people,

all of 'em. I don't like this.

MEN

Go on, go on! Keep movin'!

BOOKKEEPER

Want to work?

TOM

Sure, but what is this?

BOOKKEEPER

That's not your affair. Name.

TOM

Joad.

BOOKKEEPER

How many men?

TOM

Four.

BOOKKEEPER

Women?

TOM

Two.

BOOKKEEPER

Kids?

TOM

Two.

BOOKKEEPER

Can all of you work?

TOM

Why, I guess so.

BOOKKEEPER

Okay. House 63. Wages 5 cents a box.

No bruised fruit. Move along and go

to work right away.

FIRST DEPUTY

Name.

TOM

(impatiently)

Joad. Say, what is this here?

SECOND DEPUTY

(consulting list)

Not here. Take a look at his license.

FIRST DEPUTY

542-567 Oklahoma.

SECOND DEPUTY

Ain't got it. Guess they're okay.

(To Tom)

Now you look here. We don't want no

trouble with you. Jes' do your work

and mind your own business and you'll

be all right.

(The deputies walk

away)

TOM

They sure do want to make us feel at

home all right.

ROSASHARN

We gonna live here?

MA

(after a moment)

Why, sure. It won't be so bad once

we get her washed out.

ROSASHARN

I like the tent better.

MA

This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when

it rains.

CLERK

Name?

TOM

(patiently)

It's still Joad.

CLERK

(doling out the buckets)

How many?

MA

(at the door)

Six.

(To Tom)

All y'all go. Me an' Rosasharn'll

unload.

TOM

(wiping his mouth)

Got any more, Ma?

MA

No. That's all. You made a dollar,

an' that's a dollar's worth.

PA

That!

MA

They charge extry at the comp'ny

store but they ain't no other place.

TOM

I ain't full.

MA

Well, tomorra you'll get in a full

day--full day's pay--an' we'll have

plenty.

PA

(rising)

You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up

an' pickin'd get you in the back.

TOM

Think I'll walk out an' try to fin'

out what all that fuss outside the

gate was. Anybody wanta come with

me?

PA

No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an'

then go to bed.

AL

Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I

can't meet me a girl.

TOM

Thing's been workin' on me, what

they was yellin' about. Got me all

curious.

JOHN

I got to get a lot curiouser than I

am--with all them cops out there.

TOM

(laughing)

Okay. I be back a little later.

MA

You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be

stickin' your nose in anything.

TOM

(leaving)

Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.

GUARD

Where you think you're going?

TOM

Thought I'd take a walk. Any law

against it?

GUARD

Well, you just turn around and walk

the other way.

TOM

You mean I can't even get outa here?

GUARD

Not tonight you can't. Want to walk

back?--or you want me to whistle up

some help and take you back?

TOM

I'll walk back.

TOM

Evenin'.

JOE

Who are you?

TOM

Jus' goin' pas', that's all.

JOE

Know anybody here?

TOM

No. Jus' goin' pas', I tell you.

CASY

What's the matter?

TOM

Casy! What you doin' here?

CASY

Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya,

boy?

TOM

Thought you was in jail.

CASY

No, I done my time an' got out. Come

on in.

(He pulls Tom into

the tent.)

FRANK

This the fella you been talkin' about?

CASY

This is him. What you doin' here,

Tommy?

TOM

Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen

a bunch a fellas yellin' when we

come in, so I come out to see what's

goin' on. What's it all about?

FRANK

This here's a strike.

TOM

(puzzled)

Well, fi' cents a box ain't much,

but a fella can eat.

FRANK

Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?

TOM

Sure. We made a buck since midday.

CASY

(after a long silence)

Lookie, Tom. We come to work here.

They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents.

But they was a whole lot of us, so

the man says two an' a half cents.

Well, a fella can't even eat on that,

an' if he got kids...

(After a pause)

So we says we won't take it. So they

druv us off. Now they're payin' you

five--but when they bust this strike

ya think they'll pay five?

TOM

I dunno. Payin' five now.

CASY

(soberly)

I don't expeck we can las' much longer--

some a the folks ain't et for two

days. You goin' back tonight?

TOM

I aim to.

CASY

(earnestly)

Well--tell the folks inside how it

is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin'

us and stabbin' theirself in the

back. An' as sure as God made little

apples it's goin' back to two an' a

half jus' as soon as they clear us

out.

FRANK

(suddenly)

You hear sump'n?

TOM

I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how.

Never seen so many guys with guns.

Wouldn't even let us talk today.

CASY

Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get

two an' a half, jus' the minute we're

gone. An' you know what that is?

That's one ton a peaches picked an'

carried for a dollar. That way you

can't even buy food enough to keep

you alive! Tell 'em to come out with

us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two

days out an' they'll pay *all* of us

five!

TOM

They won't. They're a-gettin' five

an' they don't care about nothin'

else.

CASY

But jus' the minute they ain't strike-

breakin' they won't get no five!

FRANK

(bitterly)

An' the nex' thing you know you'll

be out, because they got it all

figgered down to a T--until the

harvest is in you're a *migrant*

worker--afterwards, just a bum.

TOM

Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's

all they're int'rested in. I know

exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say

it wasn't none a his business.

CASY

(reluctantly)

I guess that's right. Have to take a

beatin' before he'll know.

TOM

We was outa food. Tonight we had

meat. Not much, but we had it. Think

Pa's gonna give up his meat on account

a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs

milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that

baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is

yellin' outside a gate?

CASY

(sadly)

Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'.

Don't know it right yet myself, but

I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I

can't ever be a preacher again.

Preacher got to *know*.

(Shaking his head)

I don't. I got to *ask*.

JOE

(sticking his head in

tent)

I don't like it.

CASY

What's the matter?

JOE

Can't tell. Seems like I hear sump'n,

an' then I listen an' they ain't

nothin' to hear.

FRANK

(rising)

'Tain't outa the question, y'know.

(He exits)

CASY

All of us a little itchy. Cops been

tellin' us how they gonna beat us up

an' run us outa the country. Not

them reg'lar deppities, but them tin-

star fellas they got for guards.

(After a pause)

They figger I'm the leader because I

talk so much.

FRANK

Turn out that light an' come outside.

They's sump'n here.

CASY

(softly)

What is it?

FRANK

I dunno. Listen.

CASY

Can't tell if you hear it or not.

You hear it, Tom?

TOM

(softly)

I hear it. I think they's some guys

comin' this way, lots of 'em. We

better get outa here.

JOE

(whispering)

Down that way--under the bridge span.

VOICE

There they are! Stand where you are!

DEPUTY

That's him! That one in the middle,

the skinny one! Chuck! Alec! Here

they are! We got 'em!

CASY

Listen, you fellas. You don't know

what you're doin'. You're helpin' to

stave kids.

DEPUTY

Shut up, you red--

SECOND DEPUTY

Looks like to me you killed him.

DEPUTY

Turn him over. Put the light on him.

DEPUTY'S VOICE

Serves him right, too.

SECOND DEPUTY

Where's that flash?

THIRD DEPUTY

Here.

THIRD DEPUTY

(awed)

Boy, he's *good* and dead! You see

that fella that done it?

SECOND DEPUTY

I ain't sure--but I caught him one

across the face, and believe me, I

give him a trade-mark *he* ain't

gonna be able to shake off easy!

MA

Anybody ask anything?

ROSASHARN

No'm.

MA

Stand by the door.

MA

How's it feel, Tommy?

TOM

Busted my cheek but I can still see.

What'd you hear?

MA

Looks like you done it.

TOM

(soberly)

I kinda thought so. Felt like it.

MA

Folks ain't talkin' about much else.

They say they got posses out. Talkin'

about a lynchin'--when they catch

the fella.

TOM

They killed Casy first.

MA

That ain't the way they're tellin'

it. They're sayin' you done it fust.

TOM

(after a pause)

They know what--this fella looks

like?

MA

They know he got hit in the face.

TOM

(slowly)

I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know

what I was doin', no more'n when you

take a breath. I didn't even know I

was gonna do it.

MA

It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you

didn't do it, but you done what you

had to do. I can't read no fault in

you.

TOM

I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't

go puttin' this on you folks.

MA

(angrily)

Tom! They's a whole lot I don't

understan', but goin' away ain't

gonna ease us.

(Thoughtfully)

They was the time when we was on the

lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then.

Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas

come, an' we was always one thing--

we was the fambly--kinda whole an'

clear. But now we ain't clear no

more. They ain't nothin' keeps us

clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a-

jibbitin' to go off on his own. An'

Uncle John is just a-draggin' along.

Pa's lost his place--he ain't the

head no more. We're crackin' up,

Tom. They ain't no fambly now.

Rosasharn--

(a glance at the girl)

--she gonna have her baby, but *it*

ain't gonna have no fambly. I been

tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'--

what's he gonna be, this-a-way?

Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too--

like animals. Got nothin' to trus'.

Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help

me.

TOM

(tiredly)

Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I

know I shouldn't. But okay.

ROSASHARN

Here come a lot of people.

BOOKKEEPER'S VOICE

How many of you?

MIGRANT'S VOICE

Ten of us. Whatcha payin'?

BOOKKEEPER

House 25. Number's on the door.

MIGRANT

Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?

BOOKKEEPER

Two and a half cents.

MIGRANT

(angrily)

Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man

can't make his dinner on that.

BOOKKEEPER

Take it or leave it. There's 200 men

coming from the South that'll be

glad to get it.

MIGRANT

But--but how we gonna eat?

BOOKKEEPER

Look, I didn't set the price. I'm

just working here. If you want it,

take it. If you don't, turn right

around and beat it.

MIGRANT

(sullenly)

Which way is House 25?

TOM

(slowly)

That Casy. He might a been a preacher,

but--he seen a lot a things clear.

He was like a lantern--he helped mw

see things too.

MA

Comes night we'll get outa here.

MA

It's jus' till we get some distance.

Then you can come out.

TOM

I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.

GUARD'S VOICE

What's goin' on here?

PA

We're goin' out.

GUARD

What for?

MA

We got a job offered--good job.

GUARD

Yeah? Let's have a look at you.

(He plays his

flashlight on the

truck)

Wasn't there another fella with you?

AL

You mean that hitch-hiker? Little

short fella with a pale face?

GUARD

I guess that's what he looked like.

AL

We just picked him up on the way in.

He went away this mornin' when the

rate dropped.

GUARD

(thinking hard)

What'd he look like again?

AL

Short fella. Pale face.

GUARD

Was he bruised up this mornin'? About

the face?

AL

I didn't see nothin'.

GUARD

(reluctantly)

Okay. Go on.

SECOND GUARD

Goin' out for good?

AL

Yeah. Goin' north. Got a job.

SECOND GUARD

Okay.

MA

You done good, Al. Just good.

PA

Know where we're a-goin'?

MA

(shaking her head)

Don't matter. Just got to go--an'

keep a-goin', till we get plenty a

distance away from here.

ROSASHARN

Ma... you know, if Connie was here I

wouldn't min' any a this.

MA

I know, honey, an' just as soon as

we get settled Al's gonna set out

an' look for him. How 'bout gas,

Tommy?

TOM

Full up. Uncle John come through

with five bucks he been hol'in' out

on us since we lef' home.

TOM

She's hotter'n a heifer.

AL

Fan-belt's shot.

TOM

(looking around)

Picks a nice place for it, too, don't

she?

TOM

Any gas?

AL

Gallon or two?

TOM

(whistling)

Well, looks like we done it this

time awright!

ROSASHARN

(standing in truck)

Tommy.

(Pointing)

Some smoke up there.

TOM

Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll

make it?

AL

She got to make it.

MA

(as they get back in)

What is it?

TOM

Don't know--but it's better'n this.

CARETAKER

(mildly)

You hit 'er too fast.

AL

What's the idea of that?

CARETAKER

(chuckling)

Well, a lot a kids play in here. You

tell folks to go slow and they liable

to forget. But let 'em hit that hump

once and they don't forget!

AL

Got any room here for us?

CARETAKER

(nodding)

You're lucky. Fellow just moved out

half-hour ago.

(Pointing)

Down that line and turn to the left.

You'll see it. You'll be in No. 4

Sanitary Unit.

MA

What's that?

CARETAKER

Toilet and showers and washtubs.

MA

You mean you got *washtubs?* An'

runnin' water?

CARETAKER

Yes, ma'am.

(To Al)

Camp committee'll call on you in the

morning and get you fixed.

AL

(quickly)

Cops?

CARETAKER

No. No cops. Folks here elect their

own cops.

(To Ma)

The ladies' committee'll call on

you, ma'am, about the kids and the

sanitary unit and who takes care of

'em.

(To Al)

Come inside and sign up.

TOM

Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.

PA

We gonna stay, ain't we?

TOM

You're tootin' we're gonna stay.

(He follows the

caretaker into the

shack)

CARETAKER

I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand.

I just got to have certain

information. What's your name?

TOM

(watching him)

Joad. Tom Joad.

CARETAKER

(writing)

How many of you?

AL

How 'bout it, Uncle John? Gotta pitch

this tent.

JOHN

(groggy with sleep)

I'm a-comin'.

MA

You don't look so good.

JOHN

I *ain't* so good, but--I'm a-comin'.

CARETAKER

Camp site costs a dollar a week, but

you can work it out, carrying garbage,

keeping the camp clean--stuff like

that.

TOM

We'll work it out. What's this

committee you talkin' about?

CARETAKER

We got five sanitary units. Each one

elects a central committee man. They

make the laws, an' what they say

goes.

TOM

Are you aimin' to tell me that the

fellas that run this camp is jus'

fellas--campin' here?

CARETAKER

That's the way it is.

TOM

(after a pause)

An' you say no cops?

CARETAKER

(shaking his head)

No cop can come in here without a

warrant.

TOM

(marveling)

I can't hardly believe it. Camp I

was in once, they burned it out--the

deputies an' some of them poolroom

fellas.

CARETAKER

They don't get in here. Sometimes

the boys patrol the fences, especially

dance nights.

TOM

You got dances too?

CARETAKER

We got the best dances in the county

every Saturday night.

TOM

Say, who runs this place?

CARETAKER

Government.

TOM

Why ain't they more like it?

CARETAKER

(shortly)

*You* find out, I can't.

TOM

Anything like work aroun' here?

CARETAKER

Can't promise you that, but there'll

be a licensed agent here tomorrow

mornin', if you want to talk to him.

TOM

(leaving)

Ma's shore gonna like it here. She

ain't been treated decent for a long

time.

CARETAKER

(as Tom is at the

door)

That cut you got?

TOM

(evenly)

Crate fell on me.

CARETAKER

Better take care of it. Store

manager'll give you some stuff for

it in the morning. Goodnight.

TOM

Goodnight.

TOM

Good mornin'.

WOMAN

Mornin'.

RUTHIE

(in an excited whisper)

Git up. I got sump'n to show you.

WINFIELD

(sleepily)

Whatsa matter?

RUTHIE

(tugging him)

It's them white things, made outa

dish-stuff, like in the catalogues!

RUTHIE

Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say

anything.

WINFIELD

Won't they ketch us?

RUTHIE'S VOICE

Them's where you wash your han's.

WINFIELD'S VOICE

What's these?

RUTHIE'S VOICE

(uncertainly)

Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them

little rooms--an' water come down

outa that there little jigger up

there--take a bath!

WINFIELD'S VOICE

(excitedly)

Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't

they!

RUTHIE'S VOICE

(proudly)

I seen 'em b'fore you did.

WINFIELD'S VOICE

What's this?

RUTHIE'S VOICE

(in alarm)

Now don't you go monk'ing--

RUTHIE'S VOICE

Now you done it! You busted it!

WINFIELD'S VOICE

I never--

WINFIELD

Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!

RUTHIE

(fiercely)

Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!

WINFIELD

(weeping)

I never knowed it! All I done was

pull that string!

RUTHIE

Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?

(They listen to the

refilling of the

tank)

But lissen here. I won't tell nobody,

y'understan'?

WINFIELD

Please don't.

RUTHIE

I won't--

(craftily)

--if you won't tell what *I* done!

TOM

(exulting)

If this don't feel good!

WILKIE

(chuckling)

Wait'll about 'leven o'clock, see

how good she feels then!

TOM

Seems like a nice frien'ly fella to

work for, too.

TIM

Lotta these little farmers mighty

nice fellas. Trouble is they're

little, they ain't got much say-so.

TOM

Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway.

Gettin' some work at las'.

THOMAS

Lissen here. Maybe I'm talkin' myself

outa my farm, but I like you fellas,

so I'm gonna tell you. You live in

that gov'ment camp, don't you?

TOM

(stiffening)

Yes, sir.

THOMAS

And you have dances every Saturday

night?

WILKIE

(smiling)

We sure do.

THOMAS

Well, look out next Saturday night.

TIM

(suddenly tense)

What you mean? I belong to the central

committee. I got to know.

THOMAS

Don't you ever tell I told.

TIM

What is it?

THOMAS

(angrily)

Well, the association don't like the

government camps. Can't get a deputy

in there. Can't arrest a man without

a warrant. But if there was a big

fight, and maybe shooting--a bunch

of deputies could go in and clean

out the camp.

(Unfolding a newspaper)

Like last night. Lissen. "Citizens,

angered at red agitators, burn another

squatters' camp, warn agitators to

get out of the county."

TOM

(sick of the expression)

Listen. What *is* these reds?

Ever'time you turn aroun' somebody

sayin' somebody else's a red. What

is these reds, anyway?

WILKIE

(chuckling)

Well, I tell you. They was a fella

up the country named King--got about

30,000 acres an' a cannery an' a

winery--an' he's all a time talkin'

about reds. Drivin' the country to

ruin, he says. Got to git rid of

'em, he says. Well, they was a young

fella jus' come out an' he was

listenin one day. He kinda scratched

his head an' he says, "Mr. King,

what *is* these reds you all a time

talkin' about?" Well, sir, Mr. King

says, "Young man, a red is any fella

that wants thirty cents a hour when

I'm payin' twenty-five."

THOMAS

(fretfully)

I ain't talkin' about that one way

or the other. All I'm saying is that

there's going to be a fight in the

camp Saturday night. And there's

going to be deputies ready to go in.

TOM

But why? Those fellas ain't botherin'

nobody.

THOMAS

I'll tell you why. Those folks in to

being treated like humans. Suppose

the Government closes its camps.

Suppose too many people pass through

'em. Well, when those people go back

to the squatters' camps they'll be

hard to handle.

(Wiping his brow)

Go on back to work now. Maybe I've

talked myself into trouble, but you're

folks like us, and I like you.

TIM

(extending his hand)

Nobody won't know who tol'. We thank

you.

(Grimly)

An' they ain't gonna be no fight,

either.

COMMITTEE MAN

Ev'nin', ma'am. Who'd you say invited

you?

GUESTS

Mister an' Mizz Clark, they ast us.

COMMITTEE MAN

Yes, ma'am. Come right in, ma'am.

WILKIE

Hidy, Mr. Thomas. Hidy, Mizz Thomas.

THOMAS

(sotto voce)

You watching out, ain't you?

WILKIE

(grinning)

Don't you worry. Ain't gonna be no

trouble.

THOMAS

I hope you know what you're talking

about.

(He moves away, Wilkie

grinning after him)

ROSASHARN

Ma...

(Ma turns from drying

dishes)

Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I

jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan'

it, with Connie not here--an' me

this way.

MA

(trying to cheer her)

Why, honey, it makes folks happy to

see a girl that way--makes folks

sort of giggly an' happy.

ROSASHARN

(miserably)

I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make

*me* giggly an' happy.

MA

(tenderly)

You an' me's goin' together--jus'

you an' me. We're a-goin' to that

dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set

an' watch. If anybody says to come

dance--why I'll say you're poorly.

But you an' me, we're gonna hear the

music an' see the fun.

ROSASHARN

An' you won't let nobody touch me?

MA

No--an' look what I got for you.

MA

(softly)

I used to wear these--when your pa

come callin' on me.

(Then as she puts

them on Rosasharn's

ears)

You'll look pretty in 'em tonight.

WILKIE

They tell me you're half Injun. You

look all Injun to me.

JULE

No, jes' half. Wisht I was full-

blooded. Gov'ment'd be lookin' out

for me an' I'd be ridin' around in a

Buick eight.

COMMITTEE MAN

Who give you the invitation?

MAN

Fella named Jackson--Buck Jackson.

COMMITTEE MAN

Okay. Come on in.

JULE

Them's our fellas.

WILKIE

How you know?

JULE

Jes' got a feelin'. They're kinda

scared too. Follow 'em an' get a

holt of Jackson. See if he knows

'em. I'll stay here.

FIDDLER

Swing your ladies an' a dol ce do.

Join han's roun' an' away we go!

Swing to the right an' a swing to

the lef'. Break, now break--back to

back!

MA

(quietly)

Thank you kin'ly but she ain't well.

MA

Maybe you wouldn't think it, but

your pa was as nice a dancer as I

ever seen, when he was young.

(With a little sigh)

Kinda makes me think a ol' times.

JACKSON

I seen 'em before. Worked at

Gregorio's with 'em. But I never ast

'em.

WILKIE

Awright. Keep your eye on 'em. Jus'

keep 'em in sight, that's all.

(He moves quickly

away)

BOY

I seen 'em, Mr. Wallace. A car with

six men parked down by the euc'lyptus

tree an' one with three men on the

main road. They got guns, too. I

seen 'em.

TIM

Thank you, Willie. You done good.

(As Willie exits)

Well, it looks like the fat's in the

far this time.

FIRST MAN

(angrily)

What them deppities want to hurt the

camp for? How come they can't leave

us be?

SECOND MAN

What we oughta do, we oughta git us

some pickhandles an'--

TIM

(quickly)

No!  That's what they want. No sir.

If they can git a fight goin', then

they can run in the cops an' say we

ain't orderly--

(He stops as Wilkie

enters followed by

Tom)

WILKIE

They're here. We got 'em spotted.

TIM

(to Tom)

You sure you got ever'thing ready?

TOM

(calmly)

Ain't gonna be no trouble.

TIM

(worriedly)

You ain't to hurt them fellas.

WILKIE

(grinning)

You don't have to worry. We got

ever'thing arranged. Maybe nobody'll

even see it.

TIM

Just don't use no stick nor no knife,

no piece a arn. An' if you got to

sock 'em, sock 'em where they won't

bleed.

TOM

Yes, sir.

TIM

Awright. An' if she gets outa han',

I'll be in the right han' corner,

this side the dance floor.

TOM

(blandly)

Ain't gonna get outa han'.

FIRST MAN

Mighty sure a themselves, looks like.

TIM

All I hope, I hope they don't kill

nobody.

AL

Gonna dance tonight?

(The girl

ostentatiously ignores

him)

I can waltz.

GIRL

(aloofly)

That's nothin'--anybody can waltz.

AL

(shaking his head)

Not like me!

WOMAN

You git right along! This here girl's

spoke for. She's gonna be married,

an' her man's a-comin' for her.

TOM

(grinning)

She's gettin' prettier, Ma.

MA

(as Rosasharn hides

her face)

Girl with a baby *always* gets

prettier.

TOM

(softly)

Excuse me, Ma.

(He moves quietly out

of the scene, toward

the three men)

AL

Well, you said anybody can waltz...

How'm *I* doin'?

BLONDE GIRL

Don't hold me so tight.

AL

(tongue-in-cheek)

Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!

BLONDE GIRL

(squirming)

You're *ticklin' me!*

AL

(grabbing her still

closer)

That comes from not holdin' you tight

*enough.*

BLONDE GIRL

(complaining but loving

it)

Now I can't breathe.

LEADER

I'll dance with this girl.

AL

(angrily)

You an' who else?

LEADER

Don't gimme no argament--

(A shrill whistle

sounds in the distance)

--you little--

DRIVER

Open up! We hear you got a riot.

CARETAKER

Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're

you?

DRIVER

Deputy sheriffs.

CARETAKER

Got a warrant?

DRIVER

We don't need a warrant if it's a

riot.

CARETAKER

Well, I don't know what you gonna do

about it, because I don't hear no

riot an' I don't see no riot, an'

what's more I don't believe they

*is* no riot.

(Waving toward the

dance floor)

Look for yourself.

CARETAKER

You got no right to arrest anybody

without a warrant, you know.

FIRST COP

We'll have a warrant--just as soon

as we check with headquarters.

MA

Ain't you gonna tell me goodbye,

Tommy?

TOM

I didn't know, Ma. I didn't know if

I ought.

TOM

Come outside.

TOM

They was some cops here, Ma. They

was takin' down the license numbers.

It looks like somebody knows sump'n.

MA

(softly)

It had to come, I reckon, soon or

later.

TOM

I'd like to stay. I'd like to be

with ya--

(smiling)

--an' see your face when you an' Pa

get settled in a nice little place.

I sure wish I could see you then.

But--

(shaking his head)

--I guess I won't never be able to

do that. Not now.

MA

I could hide you, Tommy.

TOM

(touching her hand)

I know you would, Ma. But I ain't

gonna let you. You hide somebody

that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd

be in trouble too.

MA

(touching his face

with her fingers)

Awright, Tommy. What you figger you

gonna do?

TOM

(thoughtfully)

You know what I been thinkin' about,

Ma? About Casy. About what he said,

what he done, an' about how he died.

An' I remember all of it.

MA

He was a good man.

TOM

I been thinkin' about us, too--about

our people livin' like pigs, an'

good rich lan' layin' fallow, or

maybe one fella with a million acres,

while a hundred thousan' farmers is

starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if

all our folks got together an' yelled--

MA

(frightened)

Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut

you down like they done to Casy.

TOM

They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or

later they'll get me, for one thing

if not another. Until then...

MA

You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!

TOM

No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But

long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe

I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus'

fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun'

an' try to fin' out what it is that's

wrong, an then see if they ain't

sump'n could be done about it.

(Worriedly)

But I ain't thought it out clear,

Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.

MA

(after a pause)

How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They

might kill you an' I wouldn't know.

They might hurt you. How'm I gonna

know?

TOM

(laughing uneasily)

Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a

fella ain't got a soul of his own,

but on'y a piece of a big soul--the

one big soul that belongs to ever'body--

an' then...

MA

Then what, Tom?

TOM

Then it don't matter. Then I'll be

all aroun' in the dark. I'll be

ever'where--wherever you look.

Wherever there's a fight so hungry

people can eat, I'll be there.

Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a

guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the

way guys yell when they're mad--an'

I'll be in the way kids laugh when

they're hungry an' they know supper's

ready. An' when our people eat the

stuff they raise, an' live in the

houses they build, why, I'll be there

too.

MA

(slowly)

I don't understan' it, Tom.

TOM

(drily)

Me neither.

(Rising)

It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about.

Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by.

(He climbs over the

fence)

MA

Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed

over--you'll come back? You'll try

to fin' us?

TOM

Sure. Good-by.

MA

Good-by, Tommy.

AL, PA, JOHN

(ad lib)

Get them buckets on! Somebody tie

down the mattress! You little fellas

keep outa the way!

MAN

(from the other truck,

gaily)

What y'all hurryin' so for? Tell me

they got twenny days work.

PA

Yes, sir, an' we aim to git in all

twenny of 'em.

AL

Ready, Ma?

MA

I'll get Rosasharn.

PA

(beaming)

All aboard, ever'body! All aboard

for Fresno!

MA

(softly)

Try to be strong, honey. Someday

it'll be diff'rent--someday you'll

have another one. You're still jus'

a little girl, remember.

PA

Make her easy, John. Watch her.

MA

She'll be awright.

AL

(in the driver's seat)

Ready, Pa?

PA

(as he and Ma climb

in the front seat)

Let 'er go, Gallagher!

CARETAKER

Good luck to you! Good luck,

ever'body!

THE JOADS

Good-by, Mr. Conway! Much oblige to

you for ever'thing!

AL

Twenty days work, oh boy!

PA

Be glad to get my han' on some cotton.

That's the kin' a pickin' I

understan'.

MA

Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe

*no* days work. We ain't got it till

we get it.

AL

(grinning)

Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?

MA

(smiling faintly)

No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no

more.

(After a pause)

I was, though. For a while I thought

we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked

like we didn't have nothin' in the

worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body

frien'ly anymore. It made me feel

bad an' scared too--like we was

lost... an' nobody cared.

AL

Watch me pass that Chevvy.

PA

(soberly)

You the one that keeps us goin', Ma.

I ain't no good any more, an' I know

it. Seems like I spen' all my time

these days a-thinkin' how it use'ta

be--thinkin' of home--an' I ain't

never gonna see it no more.

MA

Woman can change better'n a man. Man

lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody

dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or

loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a

woman it's all one flow, like a

stream, little eddies, little

waterfalls, but the river it goes

right on. Woman looks at it like

that.

AL

(at the jalopy ahead)

Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!

PA

(thinking of what Ma

says)

Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.

MA

(chuckling)

I know. Maybe that makes us tough.

Rich fellas come up an' they die,

an' their kids ain't no good, an'

they die out. But we keep a-comin'.

We're the people that live. Can't

nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody

lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa.

We're the people.

(She says this with a

simple, unaffected

conviction)

THE END
