1   EXT. BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE, SMALL TOWN  DAY                  1

Small beautiful country town in the fall, on the shore of a

great lake. Close in on school. [Music: Canon in D by

Pachelbel, and angel voices singing then: ]

CHOIR

(OS: young male voices)

In the silence of our souls,

O Lord, we contemplate Thy peace

2   INT. SCHOOL HALL, CHOIR  DAY                                 2

Students' choir rehearsing Canon in D by Pachelbel (not

originally written with lyrics). Among many, Conrad is

singing. He is just behind Jeannine Pratt. They don't know

each other yet.

CHOIR

(girls and boys

together)

Free from all the world's desires

Free of fear and all anxiety

Ooooh. Ooooh

Ooooh. Ooooh

Alleluia

Alleluia

Sing Alleluia!

[Close in on Conrad]

3   INT. CONRAD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                 3

Conrad suddenly wakes up from nightmare

4   INT. THEATER PLAY - ON STAGE    - NIGHT                       4

A man of fifty is holding his wife's hand over the breakfast

table.

MAN

Do you know we've made love one

hundred and thirteen times?

We hear laughter (numerous).

MAN (cont'd)

I figured it out on my Bowmar

calculator.

4   CONTINUED:                                                   4

Laughter again. The man and the woman are two actors on stage

of the local theater. A very conventional play. The set

represents an average American kitchen. A man and a woman are

having coffee. Man is holding woman's hand.

We gradually discover the audience of the theater.

MAN (cont'd)

To know someone that well is a

wonderful thing.

Pause

MAN (cont'd)

Two lumps?

[ close in on two couples in the audience] Beth and Calvin

and their friends. The women are amused, the men trying to

keep awake.

WOMAN

No, one.

MAN

So I don't know everything about

you. I don't know your favorite

movie stars. I can't remember the

name of your favorite perfume. I

have racked my brain and I can't

remember.

WOMAN

That's funny. It's "My Sin."

Audience laughs, Alvin wakes up and behaves. Gives a

conventional smile to his wife Beth.

MAN

But I do know, in the last twenty

four years, that I have never been

out of love with you.

5   EXT. THEATER  NIGHT                                         5

The four of them come out of the theater. The women walk

together in front, men behind.

CALVIN

CALVIN

FRIEND

It was a comedy. Wasn't it?

Essentially?

FRIEND'S WIFE

Well let's face it: Clyde Banner's

getting fat.

BETH

Yes.

FRIEND'S WIFE

He should never turn profile.

CALVIN

Most of us shouldn't turn profile.

Calvin seems stunned.

What was it you were you thinking

about?

against him, but it is cold.

and close.

Beth goes upstairs and directly into her bedroom. Calvin

notices this, then notices the light under his son's bedroom

Calvin opens the door, but does not enter the room,

respecting his son's privacy:

CALVIN

You okay?

CONRAD

Mmm, mm. Yeah.

How was the show?

Calvin shrugs, as if to say "so and so..."

CALVIN

Mmmh. Trouble sleeping?

CONRAD

No.

CALVIN

You're sure?

CONRAD

Mm-hmm.

CALVIN

Burning the midnight oil?

CONRAD

Yeah.

CALVIN

Okay.

Pause

CALVIN (cont'd)

You thought about calling that

doctor?

CONRAD

No.

CALVIN

Well, the month's up. I think we

should stick to the plan.

CONRAD

The plan was if I needed to call

him.

CALVIN

Yeah. Okay. Don't worry about it.

Get some sleep. By the way, I am

working on those Michigan State

tickets.

maintain starboard course.[The result of opposites will

But Buck's wet hand slips away. Buck tries to gain hold on

the curved slippery surface of the hull, but he can't make it

and disappears into the water, while Conrad manages somehow

to hold on.

CONRAD

Stay with me! Stay with me!

Stay with me! Bucky! Where are

DR BERGER

What did you do?

CONRAD

What I did to him!

DR BERGER

What did you do?

CONRAD

It's something... It's something...

Don't you see? It's gotta be

somebody's fault or there's no

godamm point!

No, no... Oh, no. I don't mean

that. It's that... It's just

Because I got tired!

CONRAD

Yeah? Well. Screw you, you jerk!

Conrad breaks down and cries.

DR BERGER

It hurts to be mad at him, doesn't

it?

CONRAD

Yeah. He just wasn't careful. He

just wouldn't care. He didn't see

how a bad thing might happen.

DR BERGER

Bad things happen even when people

are careful.

CONRAD

We were screwing around out there,

we should've come in when it

started to look bad.

OK, so you made a mistake.

ever occur to you that you might

have been stronger?

When you gonna quit?

Oh, God, I'd like to quit.

happened. What started all this?

That isn't it. I... I feel bad about

this, I feel really bad about this.

And just let me feel bad about

this!

DR BERGER

Okay. Listen. I feel bad about it

too.

CONRAD

Why do things have to happen to

people? It isn't fair.

DR BERGER

You're right. It isn't fair.

you did?

Feelings are scary. And sometimes

You're here and you're alive. And

don't tell me you don't feel that.

him.

CONRAD

Hi. I was gonna call but I didn't

want to wake anyone.

JEANNINE

Might have been easier...

CONRAD

Listen, I want to say something

about the other night. I mean I

liked being with you but I didn't

like myself.

JEANNINE

Conrad. I was stupid.

That was dumb of me to laugh and

it was my fault. I just didn't

know what to do. I was

embarrassed.

CONRAD

Really?   You were embarrassed?

JEANNINE

Yes. When those boys came in, it

was awful and awkward. That's what

I do when I get embarrassed. I

laugh.

CONRAD

But they were all right. They were

just up and they were having a good

time, and I let them get in the way

of what was happening. It was dumb.

It was dumb. I've been doing lots

of dumb things lately. I just

didn't know wether or not you were

being straight with me.

her heart.

CONRAD (cont'd)

Yeah?

Jeannine nods.

CONRAD (cont'd)

Anyway, I'd like to try it again. I

thought it worked out okay. Well,

except for the bowling.

Jeannine laughs, looks down, then looks up straight in his

eyes.

JEANNINE

Yes.

CONRAD

Yes?

Jeannine nods.

JEANNINE

Yes.

Conrad is moved.

CONRAD

Uh...   Are you going to school?

JEANNINE

No, not on Sunday.

Conrad realizes. Laughs.

JEANNINE (cont'd)

Have you eaten?

CONRAD

No. I haven't.

JEANNINE

Do you want some breakfast?

Okay.

We should spend more time playing

golf together, you know that?

Maybe our next vacation, strictly

golf. Pinehurst, Myrtle Beach...

CALVIN

Pinehurst would be nice. I think

Connie would like Pinehurst.

She pulls back and looks at him.

BETH

Do you do that deliberately or is

it just a reflex?

CALVIN

Well, you said "vacation", so I

just assumed you meant him too.

BETH

I'm surprised you haven't felt the

need to call him since we've been

I think there is a point.

CALVIN

He isn't the problem.

BETH

Isn't he?

CALVIN

No, he isn't. Let's talk about

what's really bothering you.

Can't you see anything except in

terms of how it affects you?

BETH

No! I can't! And neither can you,

and neither can anybody else!

Only maybe I'm just a little more

honest about it!

CALVIN

Well, stop being so godamn honest,

and start being a little generous!

And start thinking about him for

a while!

BETH

I don't know what he expects from

me. I never have known.

CALVIN

Well, I'll tell you what he

expects!

BETH

What? He wants me to throw my arms

around him everytime he passes an

exam? Well, I can't do it! I

cannot respond when someone says:

"Here, I just did this great thing.

Love me.". I can't!

CALVIN

All he wants... All he wants is to

know you don't hate him. That's it.

BETH

Hate him? My God! How could I hate

him? Mothers don't hate their

sons! Is that what he told you? Do

you see how you accept what he says

with no questions, and you can't do

the same thing to me, can you?

CALVIN

I just try to keep this family

together...

BETH

(she shouts)

I don't know what everyone wants

from me anymore!

AUDREY

Beth, nobody wants anything from

you.

WARD

Beth, listen. We all just want...

Cal, Con, everybody, we just want

you to be happy.

BETH

Happy?

WARD

Yes.

BETH

Ward, you tell me the definition of

happy, uh? But first, you better

make sure that your kids are good

and safe, that no one's fallen off

a horse, or been hit by a car, or

drowned in that swimming pool

you're so proud of! And then you

come to me and tell me how to be

happy!

She leaves. Calvin follows. Ward and his wife just stand

there.

152   INT. JET  DAY                                               152

Beth stares away from Calvin, as in a void. She sighs, closes

her eyes; Calvin turns away from the window, looks at Beth

and remembers...

When they were happily dancing...    [ to and fro twice]

Calvin in his plane seat, reflects.

153   INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT                                     153

Beth checks a pile of mail. Conrad comes in.

CONRAD

I think I'm gonna turn in.

Dinner was good.

Really good.

CALVIN

It's pretty early. You tired?

(CONTINUED)

121.

153   CONTINUED:                                                 153

CONRAD

Yeah. It was kind of a rough week.

CALVIN

I hope your grandmother wasn't too

tough on you?

CONRAD

No. She was fine. I'm glad you're

back.

Conrad gives his mother a hug, but she is like made of stone.

Calvin sees it.

CONRAD (cont'd)

Good night.

Beth remains transfixed as if she didn't know what it was all

about. Calvin sees it.

154   INT. BEDROOM  NIGHT                                       154

Beth is not sleeping, she looks up, sees her husband wrinkled

pillow, but he is not in bed. She looks at the time, gets up,

puts on a robe.

155   INT. STAIRS  NIGHT                                        155

Beth goes downstairs, tying up her robe. She stops, hearing

someone sobbing in the dark, in the dining room.

156   INT. DINING ROOM  NIGHT                                   156

Beth enters the dining room in the dark.

BETH

Calvin?

Calvin is sitting at table in the dark, sobbing, his head in

his hands.

BETH (cont'd)

Why are you crying?

Calvin doesn't answer.

BETH (cont'd)

Can I, uh... Can I get you

something?

Calvin mutters in a very low voice.

CALVIN

I don't...

(CONTINUED)

122.

156   CONTINUED:                                                 156

BETH

What did you say?

Calvin sits back in his chair.

BETH (cont'd)

Calvin. What did you say?

Calvin produces a very deep sigh.

BETH (cont'd)

Tell me.

Calvin looks up at her with a sad expression.

CALVIN

You are beautiful. And you are

unpredictable. But you're so

cautious. You're determined, Beth.

But you know something? You're not

strong. And I don't know if you're

really giving. Beth is looking at

him not knowing what this is about.

CALVIN (cont'd)

Tell me something. Do you love me?

Do you really love me?

BETH

I feel the way I've always felt

about you.

Calvin is disappointed by the answer, but not surprised, just

sad.

CALVIN

We would've been all right, if

there hadn't been any ...mess.

But you can't handle mess.

You need everything neat and

...easy.

I don't know. Maybe you can't

love anybody. It was so much

Buck. And Buck died, it was as if

you buried all your love with

him, and I don't understand that.

I just don't know.

Calvin sighs.

CALVIN (cont'd)

Maybe it wasn't even Buck.

Maybe it was just you.

Maybe, finally, it was the best

of you that you buried.

(CONTINUED)

123.

156   CONTINUED:                                                 156

CALVIN (cont'd)

But whatever it was, I don't know

who you are.

I don't know what we've been

playing at.

So I was crying.

Calvin is overcome by sadness

CALVIN (cont'd)

't know if I love you anymore. And

I don't know what I am going to do

without that.

Beth does not know what to say or do. She turns away and goes

upstairs.

157   INT. BEDROOM  NIGHT                                       157

Beth enters, kind of reflects, then goes open a closet, takes

out some luggage. A sudden burst of emotion overcomes her,

she cries but does not seem to identify the emotion, then

restrains it.

158   INT. CONRAD'S BEDROOM  DAWN                               158

In his bed Conrad is not sleeping. He hears the door of the

house close, then someone walking outside on the gravel. He

gets up, go look out of the window. Ouside, a taxi leaves. He

goes downstairs.

159   INT. STAIRS  DAWN                                         159

Conrad goes downstairs, curious. Looks around, sees nobody.

160   EXT. GARDEN  DAWN                                         160

From inside, Conrad finally sees his father in the garden,

reflecting. Patches of snow. Conrad puts on his coat over

his pyjamas, and joins him.

CONRAD

Dad?

CALVIN

The yard looks smaller without

leaves.

CONRAD

Dad? What happened?

CALVIN

Your mother's going away for a

while.

CONRAD

Where?   Why?

(CONTINUED)

124.

160   CONTINUED:                                                 160

CALVIN

Back to Houston.

Then I... I don't know.

CONRAD

Why? What... I know why.   It's me.

Isn't it?

CALVIN

No.

CONRAD

Yeah, it is. It's my fault.

CALVIN

Don't do that! Don't do that to

yourself! It's nobody's fault!

Things happen in this world,

people don't always have answers

for them, you know.

Calvin sits down.

CALVIN (cont'd)

I don't know why I'm yelling at you

for...

CONRAD

No, that's right! You're right! You

ought to do that more often.

CALVIN

Oh, yeah?

CONRAD

Yeah, yeah, Haul my ass a little,

you know. Get after me. The way you

used to for him.

CALVIN

Oh, he needed it. You didn't. You

were always so hard on yourself, I

never had the heart.

CONRAD

Oh, Dad. Don't.

CALVIN

No, it's the truth. I... I never

worried about you. I just wasn't

listening.

CONRAD

Well, I wasn't putting out many

signals then. I don't think you

could have done anything.

(CONTINUED)

125.

160   CONTINUED:                                                  160

CALVIN

No, no, no, I should ...I should've

got a handle on it somehow.

CONRAD

You know, I used to figure you had

a handle for everything. You knew

it all.

Calvin looks at him and laughs briefly at himself.

CONRAD (cont'd)

I know that wasn't fair but you

always made us feel like everything

was gonna be all right. I thought

about that a lot lately. I really

admire you for it.

Calvin is moved.

CALVIN

Well, don't admire people too much.

They'll disappoint you sometimes.

CONRAD

I'm not disappointed.

I love you.

Calvin looks at him, cries and takes him in his arms.

CALVIN

I love you too.

They hug each other.
