BOBBY

Get off the goddamn road!

BOBBY

Fuck you!

BOBBY

No!...Not now!...Shit!

BOBBY

Oh shit!

BOBBY

You Harlin?

DARRELL

Nope.  Darrell.

BOBBY

Harlin around?

DARRELL

He's up at the Look Out.

BOBBY

Will he be back soon?

DARRELL

Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a

cemetery.

BOBBY

You own this place?

DARRELL

Yep.

BOBBY

Then why do you call it Harlin's?

DARRELL

'Cause Harlin used to own it.

BOBBY

But he's dead.

DARRELL

So?

BOBBY

You want to take a look at my car?  I think

the radiator hose is--

DARRELL

Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.

Sometimes I don't even want to get out of

bed. Course don't want to get out for the

cold one's neither.  Then of course the

clouds come in...

BOBBY

Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.

DARRELL

Darrell--

BOBBY

OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look

at my radiator hose.  It's busted.

BOBBY

So?

DARRELL

It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.

BOBBY

I know it's busted.  What did I just tell

you?

DARRELL

Well, you know so much why don't you just

fix it yourself?

BOBBY

If I could do you think I'd be standing

here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or

do I have to go somewhere else?

DARRELL

Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is

fifty miles from here. Only other gas

station down in town closed 3 years ago

when the mine got shut...

BOBBY

Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you

fix it, or not?

DARRELL

Yeah, I can fix it.

BOBBY

Great!

DARRELL

Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can

find a hose like this one, or close enough.

Gonna take time.

BOBBY

How much time?

DARRELL

Time.

BOBBY (rewinds his watch)

What time is it now?

DARRELL

Twenty-after-ten.

BOBBY

Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be

ninety already.

DARRELL

Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now

might be seventy-two. These clouds move

around a lot.

DARRELL

What happened to your hand?

BOBBY

Accident.

DARRELL

You got to be more careful. Hands is

important.  Let me show you something. When

I was a kid, now I don't know if you can

still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a

lawnmower.

BOBBY

I'm very interested in this but is there

someplace...

DARRELL

Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple

folk like it.

BOBBY

I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be

careful with her, will you?

DARRELL

Just a car.

BOBBY

It's not just a car. It's a sixty-four and

half Mustang convertible. That's the

difference between you and me, and why you

live here and I'm just passing through.

BOBBY

Now do you mind? I got to get some stuff

out of the trunk.

BLIND MAN

Hey!  You there!

BOBBY

You want something, old man?

BLIND MAN

Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got

no respect, boy?

BOBBY

You want something?

BLIND MAN

Yeah I want something.  I want you to run

over to that machine and get me a pop.

BOBBY

You can't do that yourself?

BLIND MAN

Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm

blind.  Can't you see that?

BOBBY

I'm sorry, I didn't--

BLIND MAN

What'd you think I was doing out here

with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?

BOBBY

I don't know.  I thought you were keeping

the sun out of your eyes.

BLIND MAN

I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?

BOBBY

Christ no!

BLIND MAN

Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them

fighting the commies.  Fought the war and

lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so

you can come around here and make fun of

me.

BOBBY

I said I was sorry.

BLIND MAN

Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and

get me my pop before I die of thirst.

BOBBY

Yeah, sure.  You got change?

BLIND MAN

Change?  You want my change?  I fought the

war and lost my eyes just so I could give

you my change?

BOBBY

All right, old man.  Christ.

BLIND MAN

Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Colas.

Colas ain't nothing but flavored water.

BLIND MAN

Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be

opening my own bottle.

BOBBY

Christ!

BLIND MAN

A little for Mother Earth. I'm about fifty

percent Indian, you know. To all our

relations.

BLIND MAN

Ah!  Just what I needed!  Want some?

BOBBY

I'll pass.

BOBBY

I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.

He looks sick.

BLIND MAN

That's 'cause he's dead.

BOBBY

Oh, Jesus.

BLIND MAN

I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was

you?

BOBBY

What the hell are you keeping a dead dog

around for?

BLIND MAN

He's only just dead.  What was I supposed

to do with him?  I can't take him away

anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for

me.  Do you?

BOBBY

Hell no!

BLIND MAN

See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him

here beside me.  That's where he belongs

anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not

anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals

since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was

just a pup then... a companion that's

loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no

matter how much you kick him...I miss him.

(as Bobby moves away) I'll see ya later,

unless I come across something worse.

BOBBY

Can I give you a hand, beautiful?

GRACE

I'm just going to my car?

BOBBY

That's right on my way.

GRACE

My mother told me never to accept offers

from strangers.

BOBBY

My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger

anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get

to know each other, beautiful?

GRACE

Do you have to call me that?

BOBBY

I don't know your real name.

GRACE

Maybe I don't want you to.

BOBBY

Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would

have kept on walking.

GRACE

You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?

BOBBY

I like that about me, beautiful.

GRACE

It's Grace.

BOBBY

May I carry your package, Grace?

BOBBY

Jesus.

GRACE

You sure you can manage?

BOBBY

I got it.

GRACE

Do you want me to carry your pack for you?

BOBBY

No!

BOBBY

No, I've got it.

GRACE

What happened to your hand?

BOBBY

Accident.

GRACE

You should be more careful.

GRACE

It's very nice of you to help me.  That

package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.

BOBBY

No trouble at all, really.

BOBBY

Wasn't nothing.

GRACE

Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.

I should have parked closer.  I just didn't

think it would be so heavy.  I could drive

up.

BOBBY

That's all right.  I got it.

GRACE

It's just new drapes and curtain rods.  If

I had known it was going to be so heavy I

would have had them delivered up to the

house.

BOBBY (panting)

That a fact?

GRACE

I just got tired of looking at the old

drapes. My mother made them. Had them long

as I can remember. You ever seen something

and just knew you had to have it?

BOBBY (straining)

Yes, I have.

GRACE

'Course they cost a little more than I

should really be spending.  But, damn it, I

don't hardly ever do anything nice for

myself.  I deserve nice things.

BOBBY (can hardly talk)

I ... can't ... argue ...

GRACE

This is it.

GRACE

Thank you, Bobby.

BOBBY

You're welcome, Grace.

GRACE

You're not from around here, are you?

BOBBY

Why you say that?  Just because I help a

lady with her package?

GRACE

You don't have that dead look in your eyes

like the only thing you live for is to get

through the day.

BOBBY

I just drove in this morning.

GRACE

Drove into Superior?  What for?

BOBBY

Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up

the road.

GRACE

You're lucky you didn't break down in the

desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no

time. When you leaving?

BOBBY

Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how

long that's going to take.

GRACE

And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.

SHERIFF

Morning Grace.

GRACE

Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.

SHERIFF

Well it's about time. Looks like you found

yourself a helper too.

Bobby wants to shrink behind the drapes.

GRACE

Well, he offered, and I just couldn't

refuse. His car overheated.

SHERIFF

Oh?

BOBBY

Morning, officer.

SHERIFF

Son.

(beat, to Grace)

Little excitement out at the reservation

this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were

up drinking all night and then Wayne starts

chasing Dale around the desert with his

shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for

backup.

GRACE

Anybody hurt?

SHERIFF

Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's

sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he

didn't kill his own danged self.

(beat)

Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting

you, son.

BOBBY

Same here, officer.

GRACE

Well, I guess I could use some help

getting this box into the house.  Not far.

You could shower, get something cool to

drink.

BOBBY

Well, I could use something cool.

GRACE

Where you coming from?

BOBBY

All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just

lately Dallas.

GRACE

You've been around.

BOBBY

I guess I've got wander in my blood.

GRACE

Where you headed?

BOBBY

I don't know.  I have to make a stop in

Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe

I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be

able to pick up some action there.

GRACE

So, what is it you do, Mister...?

BOBBY

Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever

pays best. Little bartending, used to teach

tennis, played a little competition ...

(drops it).

GRACE

I never played tennis. You just travel

around Bobby-- no direction, no steady

work.  You must like taking chances.

BOBBY

If you're going to gamble, might as well

play for high stakes.

GRACE

What happens when you lose?

BOBBY

I pack up and go somewhere else.

GRACE (wistfully)

Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere

else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the

State Fair. It was nice, but it wasn't

nothing.

BOBBY

I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.

I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do,

and get out.

GRACE

Sometimes I feel the exact same way.

VOICE(V.O.)

I want my money.

VOICE(V.O.)

I want my money.

BOBBY

Look, I'll get the money! You don't want to

do this!

VOICE (V.O.)

Take two for now. One a week, punk...

screaming

to

VOICE (V.O.)

Two weeks, asshole. Get the money or you

gonna lose your nose and ears.

BOBBY (to himself)

You're still lucky.

GRACE

Thought you might like a refill on your lemonade.

BOBBY

That's good.  Cools you right off.

(tentatively) I saw you watching me.

GRACE

I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.

BOBBY

I didn't say it bothered me.

GRACE

Did you like it; me watching you?

BOBBY

I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.

GRACE

Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.

BOBBY

Nice place.

GRACE

Thank you.

BOBBY

Who's that, your father?

GRACE (without much thought)

Stepfather...

BOBBY (coy)

Got a boyfriend?

GRACE

No. Not really.

BOBBY

Must get kind of lonely for a woman living

by herself in a big house.

GRACE

I guess it must.

BOBBY

What do you do anyway?

GRACE

A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly

I tell fortunes.

BOBBY

Where'd you learn to do that?

GRACE

From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.

BOBBY

A medicine man?

GRACE

Those are white words, not ours.

BOBBY

Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You

must be good.

GRACE

Come here.

GRACE

There's something in your past; something

you want to keep hidden.  There's a pain.

Something ... someone you can't forget.

And there is something you want very badly.

It seems very far away to you, but you are

determined, and you will do what you must

to get it.

BOBBY

My face tell you all that?

GRACE

It tells me what every face tells me.

Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and

they have something they want.

(seductively) What is it you want?

BOBBY

The same thing you do.

GRACE

Really?  I want to hang drapes.

GRACE

Hold me.

GRACE

Tighter.  I won't break. You know girls are

a lot tougher than men think.

GRACE

There.  All done.  Lift me down.

BOBBY

What?

GRACE

Lift me down.

GRACE

You can let go of me now. I'm safe.(with

a wicked smile) How do they look?

BOBBY

Like you.

GRACE

Beautiful?

BOBBY (kidding)

Like they're made of polyester.

GRACE

I like them.  I was sick of looking at this

room.  I think they add a little life.

BOBBY

Nothing like a little liveliness.

GRACE

No more drapes to hang.  Now what should

we do?

BOBBY

I have an idea.

GRACE

And what would that be?

BOBBY

All right, Grace.  No more games.

GRACE (innocently)

Games?

BOBBY

You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You

lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go

for being jerked around.

GRACE

Really?  And what game did you want to

play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall

into bed with you?

BOBBY

I think I can find my own way back to

into town.

GRACE

Maybe I like to find out about a man first.

Maybe I like to know what he's made of.

BOBBY

I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a

few memories of bad women; just like most

guys.  But you already know that.  You read

my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.

GRACE

You never did answer my question.

BOBBY

Still playing?

GRACE

That's not an answer.  What is it you want?

BOBBY

You know what I want.

GRACE

Maybe I just want to hear you say it.

JAKE (O.S.)

Grace!

GRACE (nonplussed)

Jake.  I thought you...

JAKE

Who the hell is this!?

BOBBY

Who the hell are you?

JAKE

I'm her husband.

BOBBY (shocked whisper)

Husband ...?

JAKE

Now who the hell are you, and it better be

good, or God help me I'll break you in

half.

BOBBY

Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife.

I met her in town.  She needed a hand with

her drapes.  That's all.

JAKE

Didn't much look like you were hanging

drapes.

BOBBY

I swear to you that's all that happened.  I

haven't so much as set foot in your

bedroom.

JAKE

A lot that means.

BOBBY

Grace, tell him.

BOBBY

Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.

GRACE (coyly)

If he says that's what happened, Jake, it

must be true.

JAKE

Oh yeah, and I suppose you didn't have

anything to do with it Grace, he just

wandered up here by hisself. I got a mind

to put you over my knee and paddle your

ass

raw

!

BOBBY (to Grace)

You bitch! Is this what it's all about? You

sucker me up here so you can watch the two

of us beat the shit out of each other over

you? You both... Forget it! (heads for the

door)

JAKE

Where you going!

BOBBY (exiting)

'Scuse me, you want to take my head off,

mister. I won't even try to stop you. I

deserve it for being an idiot. But if

you're not, I think I'll be on my way...

Ow!

JAKE

You can't just walk in here and walk out,

you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new

asshole!

BOBBY

You broke my nose!

JAKE

It ain't broke.

BOBBY

Goddamn it! I'm... you're lucky I don't sue

you.

JAKE (opens the door)

Get goin' Junior.

BOBBY

You people are crazy!

BOBBY

Fuckin' shithole!

BOBBY

What the fuck do you want?

JAKE

I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be

walking... People die out here, y'know.

JAKE

Aw, you're not still upset about that love

tap, are you? If I meant you real trouble,

I'd have given it to you by now. Get in,

lad. Come on. Get in.

JAKE

After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I

got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants

to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it

instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that.

It's a funny thing, women.

BOBBY

Yeah...

JAKE

Say, what happened to your hand?

BOBBY

Accident.

JAKE

You've got to be--

BOBBY

Yeah, I know.  More careful.

JAKE

I guess we've never been introduced proper.

Jake McKenna.

BOBBY

That's a solid name.

JAKE

I'm a solid man.

BOBBY

Bobby Cooper.

JAKE

"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to

Superior, Coop?

BOBBY

An overheated car.

JAKE

Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?

BOBBY

Darrell's a moron.

JAKE (laughs)

Yeah, he sure is a character. You need any

help with that car now?... Where you

headed?

BOBBY

California...

JAKE

Live there?

BOBBY

Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.

Wants me to sail it for him.

JAKE

You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.

Drive across the country, step on a boat

and just sail away.  A man could pretty

well disappear like that.  Just sail away

until all he was was a memory.  I guess a

little place like this would just be a dot

on a map to you after awhile.

BOBBY

I hope so. (beat) Listen, McKenna about

your wife:  If I had known she was

married--

JAKE

It wouldn't have made a difference to you,

now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why?

Because you're a man without scruples.

BOBBY

Wait a second--

JAKE

Ah, I can smell it on you.

BOBBY

Hey!

JAKE

That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an

honest bone in his body.  Don't be

offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics

is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how

can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a

mind of her own, and a body to match, don't

she?  Eh?

JAKE

She does at that.  I knew when I married

her she was a free spirit.  A woman with

her looks and a man my age; what was I to

expect?  But you see a woman like that in a

town like this and you don't think, you do.

So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?

Women.

BOBBY

Can't live with them, and you can't shoot

'em.

JAKE

"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.

(laughs) I bet she led you on good, didn't

she?  Taking you up to the house to hang

drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had

you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your

face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down

her pants and hog her out. Then me busting

in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a

fire going under you.

BOBBY

Like you don't know.

JAKE

Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I

can tell you got a temper on you.

JAKE

Bet you just wanted to snap her neck right

then, didn't you?  Bet you just wanted to

kill her.

JAKE

Would you?

BOBBY

Would I what?

JAKE

Would you kill her?

JAKE

Because I'm sick and tired of her little

games.  Because you could do it and drift

away on your boat and no one would ever see

you again.  Because I've got a

fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy

on her, and I would be more than happy to

give the man who does her in a good chunk

of it.

BOBBY

I've done a few things but I'm not a

murderer, Mr. McKenna.

JAKE

How do you know if you've never tried?

BOBBY

This is a joke, right?  You just want to

rattle me.  Right?

JAKE

That's right.  Nothing but a joke.  That's

all.

JAKE

Enjoy your stay, lad.

BOBBY

Who

are

these people?

BOBBY

Got any cold soda?

WOMAN

Eh?

BOBBY

Soda.  You got any soda?

WOMAN

Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es

bien.

BOBBY

Soda.  You know.

WOMAN

Oh.  Something to eat.  Si.

BOBBY

Not eat.  Drink.  What the fuck is drink in

Spanish ... uh, agua?

BIKER

That's right, lady.  Keep it in you and

nobody gets hurt.  That goes for you too,

stud.  Gimmie the money.  Now!

WOMAN

Eh?

SECOND BIKER

The dinero, Senora.  Hand it over.

BIKER

That's it?  Lady, I got kids to put through

school.

WOMAN

Es all I have.

BIKER

Okay, pal.  Whatcha got? Give it, now.

BIKER (thumbing through it, impressed)

Nice...Just who

are you

beautiful? What

else you got for papa?

BIKER

Better...you're getting tasty. Now toss the

bag, sweetie.

BOBBY

It's just books.

BIKER

I'm a reader. Toss it.

BOBBY (an entreaty)

It's personal things...family things.

BIKER

How touching...I like family values. Give

it to me.

BOBBY

No.

BIKER

No?

SECOND BIKER

Hey man, forget it. Come on.

BIKER

No?

WOMAN

Senor, give him the bag.

BIKER

That's all right. He doesn't want to give

me the bag...

SECOND BIKER

He's fucking with you man. Shoot him.

BIKER (cont'd)

...he doesn't have to give me the bag.

SECOND BIKER

Let's go, man.

BIKER

A little extra never hurt, Benji, would you

just relax.

WOMAN

No!  No! My wedding ring.

BIKER

Now we go.

WOMAN

You go to El Diablo!

SECOND BIKER

Bugger! You bitch!

WOMAN (cursing in Spanish)

Hijos de puta. Bayan a comer su propia

mierda en el infierno. (TRANSLATION: Sons

of bitches. Go eat your own shit in hell).

WOMAN

I call the sheriff.

BOBBY

No! No police.

WOMAN

A hundred dollars? No police?

BOBBY

No police until I leave.

FADE TO:

BOBBY

Hey.

DARRELL

Hey, your ... what the hell happened to

you?

BOBBY

Nothing.

DARRELL

Don't look like nothing.

BOBBY

Just banged my head.  It was an accident.

DARRELL

Another accident?  You got to be more

careful.

BOBBY

What the hell happened to my car?

DARRELL

Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear

through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like

a dream now.

BOBBY (suspicious)

How much?

DARRELL

Well ... you got your parts, you got your

labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty

bucks.

BOBBY

How much!?

DARRELL

Hundred-fifty.

BOBBY

To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?

DARRELL

A goddamn radiator hose in a

sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know

how long it took me to find that hose?

BOBBY

About an hour and a half, because that's

all the longer I've been gone.

DARRELL

Actually, it's been about three hours.

You're the one thinks that car's so damn

fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn

prices?

BOBBY

That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to

tell me no one else in this shit hole

drives a Ford?

DARRELL

"That's not just a Ford, that's a

sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."

BOBBY

What's that got to do with the radiator hose?

DARRELL

I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living

here and you're just passing through."  Now you

owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.

BOBBY

It might as well be fifteen-hundred

dollars, because I don't have the money.

DARRELL

Then you ain't gonna have the car.

BOBBY

Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago

for everything I had.

BOBBY

I've got five...six dollars.

DARRELL

Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in

the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now

why don't you just take your American

Express Gold Card, and call that guy with

the big schnooz on TV and have him send you

the money lickity split.

BOBBY

I don't have a goddamn credit card.

DARRELL

Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know

how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause

you're gonna have to work this one off.

BOBBY

Look, I got a Movado.  It's worth at least

seven, eight hundred. You could sell it for

that.

DARRELL (studying it)

Who the hell to? Shit, can't see no

numbers.

BOBBY

You don't need numbers.  That's why it's

expensive.  Look at the gold.

DARRELL

...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't

worth a duck's fart (proffers his own

watch). This one here cost me $3.75 and

it's got every doodad you can imagine. No

sir I'll stick with this (walks away).

BOBBY

You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers

shut you down.

DARRELL

You ain't got no credit card but you got a

lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't

you read the sign? It says...

BOBBY

What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.

DARRELL

I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.

ED

One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was

back in July of forty-seven. That afternoon

it dropped down to forty three! True story.

BOYD

One time last year I remember it went from

98 to 23 same day. Wind, black clouds come

out like...

BOBBY

You got a beer?

FLO

What kind?

BOBBY

Beck's.

FLO

No Beck's. A-1, Coors...

BOBBY

Heineken?

FLO

No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got

Miller.

BOBBY

Genuine Draft?

FLO

No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can

fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave

it.

BOBBY

I'll fuckin' take it. To go.

SHORT ORDER COOK

Flo, cheeseburger bleedin'.

FLO

I'll be right back with that beer.

BOBBY

...and a waitress named Flo.  Christ.

BOBBY

Fucking cat.

JENNY

Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the

juke?

BOBBY

What?

JENNY

I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a

quarter?

JENNY

What happened to your hand?

BOBBY

I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more

careful.

JENNY

Got any requests?

BOBBY

That country shit all sounds the same to

me.

JENNY

How about I pick one out for you?

JENNY

You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.

How come, I wonder, she don't put out no

more new records.

BOBBY

Cause she's dead.

JENNY

Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?

BOBBY

I've had time to get over it.

JENNY

You're not from around here, are you?

Where you from?

BOBBY

Oz.

JENNY

You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.

BOBBY

You're too quick for me.

TOBY

No....No....No I'm seeing but I'm not

believin'...Stop the wedding.  This can't

be. Hey!  What are you doing with my girl?

TOBY

I axed you a question.

JENNY

Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was

just talking.

TOBY

You shut your mouth, girl, and get back

over to our table. (to Bobby) Now, I'm not

going to axe you again, Mister.  What were

you doing with my girl?

BOBBY

I wasn't doing anything.

TOBY

That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked

to me like you was trying to make time with

her.

BOBBY

Make time?  Is everybody in this town on

drugs?

JENNY

Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a

quarter for the jukebox.

TOBY

Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's

business to take care of. I ain't never

taken no drugs, mister, and ...

BOBBY

Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I

wasn't making a play for your girl.

TOBY

You expect me to believe that?

BOBBY

I don't care what you believe as long as

you leave me alone.

TOBY

Mister, I'm calling you out.

BOBBY

What?  You want to fight?  Over her?

FLO

Toby, you go finish your soda and leave the

man alone.

TOBY (to Bobby)

You know who I am?  Toby N. Tucker.

Everyone round here call me TNT. You know

why?

BOBBY

Let's see...they're not very imaginative?

TOBY

'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I

go off, somebody gets hurt.

BOBBY

Fine.  I was making time with your girl.

Now I'm scared to death and I learned my

lesson. Now can you go away?

TOBY

Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!

BOBBY

Christ, I don't believe this!

TOBY

Stand up.

BOBBY

I wasn't hitting on your girl!

TOBY

Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where

you sit.

FLO

Toby, you stop it now! Can't you see he's

got a hurt hand?

TOBY

Don't you never mind, Flo.  This is gonna

be over real quick.

TOBY

You're lucky, Mister.  Don't think it's

over.  I called you out and I'm gonna see

this through.  You hear me? (to Jenny)

Come on, girl.  I got half a mind to make

you walk home.

FLO

My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil,

has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.

SHERIFF

What was that all about?

FLO

You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every

man he sees is after his Jenny.

SHERIFF

More like Jenny is after every man she

sees.

FLO (to Bobby)

You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to

show off for his girl.  Give him a couple

of hours, he'll cool off.  Still want that

beer?

BOBBY (tense, seeing the Sheriff)

I'll take it to go.

ED

How's it with you, Sheriff?

SHERIFF

Already started out bad.  Couple of bikers

from out of town tried to knock over

Jamilla's grocery store this morning. It

was a real shootout.

BOYD

What happened?

SHERIFF

The old witch killed 'em both.

ED

Holy shit!

FLO

Poor thing.  Is she all right?

SHERIFF

Sure, when the sons of bitches tried to

steal her wedding ring. That's when she

started shooting.  Can't blame her.  The

ring was all Carlos left her when he died.

Store's a mess.

BOYD

It's the desert.  That's what it is.  The

desert makes everybody crazy.  Ain't that

right, Sheriff?  People go crazy out here.

ED

Come on, Boyd.  I've got to make tracks.

That yogurt's got to make Santa Fe before

it spoils.

BOYD

Dr. Pepper don't have that problem.

FLO

I can't open off-sale for you, sugar.

FLO

Let me get your change.

SHERIFF

Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill

on the coffee.

FLO

You be careful now, Virgil.

SHERIFF

Son of a bitch!

FLO

Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are

you all right?

SHERIFF

I think I burned my gun hand!

SHERIFF (Cont'd)

How 'bout we put something soft on it

later? (a look)

FLO

(quietly) I could put some butter on it,

hon'. (Her normal abrasive voice) It'd

serve you right, you asshole.  Put it under

some cold water. Joe, run get a mop and

clean this fuckin' mess up.

FLO

Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the

nice man like that?  Sorry about that,

mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25. (gives

it to him) You try to have a nice day now,

would you?

BOBBY

Sure, I'll try.

BOBBY

Cici?  Cici, it's Bobby...Bobby

Cooper...Yeah, look, I know it's been a

while, but I'm kind of in a

jam...yeah...One-hundred-fifty

dollars...That's a lie. I called you on

your birthday..Two years ago...I can't help

it if you didn't get the message. Cici,

honey, I don't want to argue. I need you to

wire me the money...Because they're fucking

going to

KILL ME

!  I didn't steal your

CD's...Yeah, well where's my Mr. Coffee.

Cici...Cici...

BOBBY

Bitch. Cunt.

JUMP CUT TO:

BOBBY

73-11, this is Pluto. What's the line on

Dallas?

GAMBLER'S VOICE

Pluto. Fucking deadbeat. We head about

you. You owe "the commie" 13 dimes, why you

tryin' to get in my office? Lose this

fuckin' number.

BOBBY

Mike...Mike...you asshole.

GAMBLER'S VOICE

Mike who?

(hangs up)

JUMP CUT TO:

SERGEI

Da?

MR. ARKADY

Sergei, what are you, a Neanderthal? How

many times do I have to tell you?  You

answer a phone "hello," not "da."

SERGEI (nods yes)

Sorry, Mr. Arkady.(into phone)"Hello?"

OPERATOR(V.O.)

I have a collect call from Bobby Cooper.

Will you accept the charges?

SERGEI

Mr. Arkady, deadbeat Cooper's calling.

SERGEI

He's calling collect.

MR. ARKADY (overly sweet)

Bobby, what a surprise.  I expected to be

seeing you, not talking to you over the

phone.

INTERCUTS TO:

BOBBY

I know, Mr. Arkadin. I know. I was on my

way to you, it's just ... what a day I've

had. I know I'm coming up with a highly

improbable story, and I know you're not

going to believe this, but this ...is...

what

happened. I had the money, I swear I

had it. I was on my way to Vegas when my

car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.

MR. ARKADY

That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.

BOBBY

And that's not the half of it, Mr.

Arkadin...

MR. ARKADY

"Arkady"

BOBBY

Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half

of it. I got your money, and I go into this

little grocery store in this hicktown to

get something to eat and then... well, it

gets

robbed

!

MR. ARKADY

...And let me guess.  This robber -- he

gets your money.

BOBBY

No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they

both

get nailed... get shot by the old lady.

MR. ARKADY

The old lady?

BOBBY

With a

shotgun

!  She kills

both

of 'em,

and... and the money in my bag gets all

shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is

left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?

MR. ARKADY (beat, dry)

Pretty long, Bobby.

BOBBY

Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta

there before the cops showed. So now I

don't have a cent to my name. I can't even

get my car out of the garage.  I tell you,

Mister... (pause) if it weren't for bad

luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at

all, you know? (beat, waits)  So, I was

wondering if you could wire me a hundred

fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of

this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a

Western Union thing.  And of course I'll

pay it back with the rest of the money.

MR. ARKADY(V.O.)

Which you don't have.

BOBBY

But which I can get. No problem. Look, I

can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's

worth 16 at least. I just need the 150,

uh...

MR. ARKADY (pause)

Where are you?

BOBBY (hopeful)

Uh...a little shithole in Arizona called

Superior. About 200 miles east of Phoenix.

MR. ARKADY (pausing, V.O.)

Superior, hunh?

BOBBY(V.O.)

Yeah, if you could send it care of...

MR. ARKADY

...Now, let me get this straight. Two years

you give me problems with your fuckin'

payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand

dollars, you call me - collect - then ask

me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars

just so you can get your car fixed.

BOBBY(V.O.)

A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.

MR. ARKADY

A hundred and ... Now you listen to me

you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if

you got hit by a truck and run over by a

steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand

dollars and

I want it

.  I don't care how

you get it, or where from, but I want it on

my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what

real bad luck is.

MR. ARKADY

Do you understand me you little fuck?

BOBBY (snaps)

Oh, fuck you too!

MR. ARKADY

What'd you say to me!

BOBBY

Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the

strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of

strain here.

MR. ARKADY

Bobby, you owed me that 'bread' 4 weeks

ago. Now you tell me you want another week.

That's 5 weeks, Bobby. That's also 5

fingers, cause you and I know it's a finger

a week Bobby. So you got balls. Good--now

you come here tomorrow and you talk to me

real nice and maybe I don't take the other

3 fingers you owe me, you see? Tomorrow --

and Bobby, don't make me come look for you,

okay...have nice day.

SERGEI (into phone)

You got that? -- have nice day (hangs up).

MR. ARKADY

The nerva that piece of shit! And look at

you, you Neanderthal -- don't you fuckin'

break pencils, you goombah!

SOFIA

Finger? What are you, a faggot? In my

country a man don't pay we cut off his

head.

MR. ARKADY

Get your ass down to this Superior,

Arizona. Bring me this Bobby Cooper. I

don't think he got the lesson. This is your

last chance, Sergei.

SERGEI

Da.

OPERATOR(V.O.)

Hello?

BOBBY

Hello?

OPERATOR(V.O.)

Are you finished with your call?

BOBBY

Yeah.

OPERATOR(V.O.)

Please deposit an additional seventy-five

cents.

BOBBY

Goddamn rat's ass fuck! Shit! Damn! Damn!

Damn!

VOICE(V.O.)

Thank you for using AT&T.

BOBBY

Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I hate this fuckin' town!

I hate it! Do you hear me?

(no answer)

Get me outta here, please.  I gotta get out

of this place.

JAKE

What can I do for you, lad?

BOBBY

I was hoping we could talk.

JAKE

Talk?  About what?

BOBBY

About things.  About your wife.

JAKE

Sweet Grace?  What about her?

BOBBY

About what you said this morning.

BOBBY

You said you had an insurance policy out on

your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.

JAKE

I do.

BOBBY

You said you'd cut that up with the man who

did her in.

JAKE

I did?

BOBBY

Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a

betting man. You want me to spell it out

for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in

on the money.

JAKE

Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way

you're rambling on.

BOBBY

I'm not rambling.

JAKE

You're talking like a madman.

BOBBY

Well then, I guess that qualifies me for

citizenship in this town. You're the one

brought it up. This morning. In your car.

JAKE

Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband

gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody

dead.

BOBBY

Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.

JAKE

A man doesn't always mean the things he

says.

BOBBY

You meant it.

JAKE

What makes you say that?

BOBBY

Because you're a slimy bastard who would

have his wife killed just to get his hands

on some money.

JAKE

And what does that make you?

BOBBY

The slimy bastard who's going to do it for

you... (pause) You're a jealous man Jake.

If you can't have Grace to yourself...well,

you're not the sharing kind.

JAKE

Well, I guess I have what you call a

love-hate relationship with Grace.

BOBBY

You love her, but you hate her?

JAKE

No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of

person she is. I hate having to tolerate

the little "games" she plays. Like fucking

half of the town behind my back and

laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to

play. She wants me to hit her and when I

hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But

she's family. She's my little girl. My

baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes

roll back in her head as she sucks her last

breath, or to see her pretty pink brains

spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you?

You got the killing in you, boy...How much

you want?

BOBBY

Make it twenty.

JAKE (stressed, paces)

Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of

money.  I won't get the insurance until

months after she's dead.  I don't imagine

you'll want to be stickin' around after

poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand;

that's more money than I could ever get my

hands on.

BOBBY

How much could you get?

JAKE

Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a

maybe.

BOBBY

I need thirteen.

JAKE

That's a bit much.

BOBBY

We're not talking about buying a car Jake.

We're talking about killing your wife. It's

thirteen, or it's nothing.

JAKE

You drive a hard bargain, but I had a

feeling you were my boy when I met you.

BOBBY

I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got

no choice but to do business with you.

Let's just call this a nasty little

marriage of convenience.

JAKE

Don't say that.  I had a marriage of

convenience with Grace, and look where

that's lead...  Well, looks like we got

ourselves a contract.

BOBBY (sarcastic)

Do we shake hands?

JAKE

If you can't trust the man you've hired to

kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got

to look like an accident; that's the thing.

If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't

get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on

the chopping block while you're living it

up somewhere.

BOBBY

How do you want it?

JAKE

How the hell should I know?  I've never had

a wife killed before. Jesus Christ!

You

want this job, you don't know how to do

this? I guess I should have hired a

professional.

BOBBY

You want to do this yourself?  I don't have

to do this, you know.

JAKE

Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing.

I'm thinking. It can't be done at the

house. It should be...

BOBBY

Come to think of it, how 'bout some money

upfront?

JAKE

Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane

ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I

know you

...

(then)

This is what you do:  Go to the house to

see her.

BOBBY

(beat)

And tell her what?

JAKE(V.O.)

...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see

her.  Tell her you don't care if she's

married or not, you had to be with her.

Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like

you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe

shift the conversation.  Get her thinking

about that jeep of hers.  She loves that

thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love.

She'll want to take you for a ride.

BOBBY

I know you're not surprised I'm back here,

cause you can read my mind and all.

GRACE (seeing his new cut)

That's some cut. I told you to be more

careful.

BOBBY

Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta

you say we get out of here, take a drive

somewhere, talk...

GRACE

How do you know he's still not here?

BOBBY

Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.

JAKE(V.O.)

She'll take you out somewhere in the

desert.  She loves it out there; ridin'

through the red rock and the mesas.  So do

I.  I guess we got that in common.  She'll

ride you out someplace quiet.  Someplace

deserted.

FADE TO:

JAKE(V.O.)

There won't be anyone for miles around.

Just the two of you and some prairie dogs.

That's all.  You can sweet talk her a

little if you like.  Makes no difference to

me.  Just put her at ease, make her feel

relaxed --

then do it

.

BOBBY

Are there snakes out here?

GRACE

They hear you comin'.  They won't bother

you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.

BOBBY

Doesn't the isolation bother you?

GRACE

Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a

reservation.  The sun, the desert; they

like a religion to us.  Jake's the same

way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're

alike that way.  That's about the only way.

BOBBY

You love him?

GRACE

No.

BOBBY

Did you ever?

GRACE

Depends on what you call love. I grew up on

a reservation. A patch of desert in the

middle of nowhere. That's where they stick

Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us

to die. My brother killed himself when he

was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore.

There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket

out. Mom and me.

BOBBY

Is that why you're with him?

GRACE

I let him think he was courtin' me, but I

reeled him in like a fish on a line. I

wanted him. I wanted what he could give me,

and I would've done anything to get him. Is

that love?

BOBBY

I'm guessing no.

GRACE

Yeah, I guess you're right.

BOBBY

I take it things didn't much work out the

way you planned.

GRACE

I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?

GRACE(CONT)

All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake

like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind

being nothing but a big fish in a small

pond.  More like a little fish in a dried

up watering hole.

BOBBY

You could leave him.

GRACE

I don't know how.

BOBBY

Walk away.

GRACE

It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take

chances; maybe you can wander around like

some stray wherever you please.  I can't.

I don't want to be alone.  I need to know

I'm going to be taken care of.

BOBBY

You need a meal ticket is what you mean.

Some guy you can latch onto just long

enough for him to get you out of here.

GRACE

Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't

try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.

I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I

guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I

tried to sucker you along like that.  Do

you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you

if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:

You just got to do whatever it takes to get

out.

BOBBY (soft echo)

Whatever it takes.

GRACE

I wish I was a bird.  I know it's stupid.

Every child says that.  When I was growing

up some of the old ones on the reservation

believed people could actually change into

animals.  I wish I could.

GRACE(CONT)

If I was a bird I would fly to Florida; to

Disney World.  I always wanted to go there.

I'd fly to New York.  Maybe.  I guess New

York isn't the best place to be a bird.

I'd fly to St. Louis, then New Orleans, all

over Texas.  Then I'd fly to California.  I

guess by then I'd have seen it all and I

could die.

GRACE(CONT)

They say you don't feel anything.  The

shock kills you before you hit the ground.

I don't know how they would know that.  But

I heard it's just like flying; straight

down into the ground.  I guess if it

doesn't hurt it's a beautiful thing.

GRACE

Hate's a funny thing.  Right now I bet you

don't know if you want to kill me, or fuck

me.

GRACE

No...Stop!  I can't!

BOBBY

What's the matter?...Grace?

GRACE

Nothing.

BOBBY

Don't feel like nothing.

GRACE

Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you

can.

BOBBY

Grace, I've been fucked over too many

times, by too many women.  You're becoming

the queen of hot and cold.

GRACE

You'd never understand.

BOBBY

Try me.

GRACE

It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...

BOBBY

Nothing I understand better than a mess.

GRACE (in great tension)

Jake was with my Mom after my real Dad

died.

BOBBY

You mean the Shaman?

GRACE

He

was

a Shaman...in the mine. We had

nothin' after he died. Jake took us in,

gave us a little money. He used to call me

his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on

the side y'know, cause he was married

someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I

think, no one knew him around here...but

the thing was...you see...

(pause)

...he was raping me the whole time...for

years. He loved to do things to me. Believe

it or not, he used to say he was in love

with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a

woman's ass?

BOBBY

Yeah.

GRACE

You're sick too...he loved to do things to

me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up

cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She

become alcoholic...and the funny thing is--

I liked it. I liked being controlled by

Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as

he got, I wanted

more

. I wanted to go all

the way. Women say they don't want to be

taken like,

really taken

-- that's bullshit

-- they do. The first time he finished with

me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14.

Then he started crying like a baby...wanted

me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to

hate someone so much for so many years, but

still want to hold him, comfort him... They

found my Mom right down there (points) at

the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus

needles stuck all over her body and

Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk

and went insane. But I'll never believe she

ran off that cliff by accident. She was

born on this earth and she loved it. She

was like me. She just wanted to fly away.

GRACE

After he got his divorce, he forced me to

marry him...but when I saw her body, I

swore to her on my soul that some day I'd

get Jake for what he did to her...

BOBBY

I'm sorry...

GRACE

Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?

(shrugs, stoic) Have you ever been to

California?

BOBBY

Yeah.

GRACE (as if in a dream)

Is it far from here?

BOBBY

Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.

GRACE

Is it pretty?

BOBBY

Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches.

Blue water and clear skies as far as you

can see.

GRACE (like a little girl)

Would you take me with you?

BOBBY (pause)

I wish I could.

GRACE

Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we

get there you can dump me. I don't care. I

just want to get out of here.

BOBBY

Honey, baby, I

can't

. I can't even get out

of here

myself

. Believe it or not, I need a

lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car

back from that crazy mechanic...

GRACE

Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...

BOBBY

You don't have any money put away, do you?

GRACE

Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at

a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't

want me goin' anywhere...

BOBBY

...you could get me money. I'll get you

out of here.

GRACE

There's money. A lot.

BOBBY

Where?

GRACE

Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In

the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit

there and count it.

BOBBY

What do you mean?

GRACE

At night. He just sits there and laughs and

talks to himself and counts it. I heard

him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert

thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.

BOBBY

In

cash

?

GRACE

Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He

don't trust banks. He keeps the money in

the floor right under the bed. He loves it

so much, he wouldn't think of spending any

of it on me. I never seen it but I know

he's got more than a hunnert thousand at

least...

BOBBY

One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.

GRACE (puzzled)

What do you mean?

BOBBY (ignoring her)

If it's in a safe we'd have to get the

combination--

GRACE

It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all

the time.  I mean

all the time

.  It

scratches up against me when we do it.

BOBBY

If the key's on him, how do we get the key?

GRACE

Kill him.

BOBBY

I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.

GRACE

It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's

had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he

wouldn't even have to

feel

it...

(seductively) I mean, sometime in the

middle of the night, when it's quiet...when

he's asleep, you could just come up behind

him when he's pounding on me and...

BOBBY

Shit! Listen to you... Are you crazy,

Grace?

BOBBY

Jesus Christ! I think this place is making

me crazy. I was crazy to come back here and

see you. I'm crazy for listening to anyone

in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy

if I spent another minute with you.

GRACE

But it's in you, Bobby. I see it. I see

Death. It's in your heart. Let it out for

me. Let it out...

GRACE

Do it for me, Bobby, you'll never regret

it. I promise you. I'll do anything for

you.

Anything

.

BOBBY

I...take me back to town...

GRACE

You need the money, Bobby. It's a lot more

than $100,000. A lot more. How are you

going to get out of here? You need the

money. Whatever it takes, Bobby, remember?

GRACE

Where you going? I'll give you the

ride...Come back! Bobby? It's three miles.

GRACE (to herself)

Bobby?...Whatever it takes.

JAKE (V.O.)

You've got the killing in you, boy.

JAKE (V.O.)

Next time you'll do just fine.

BOBBY

No!

BLIND MAN

It's the desert that makes you crazy. The

loneliness out here. Nobody to talk to.

People on the run. Trailer parks. White

trash. I seen some peculiar things on a hot

day.  I seen a scorpion sting itself to

death.  It just keeps driving its tail into

its body again and again.  A little killer

killing itself.  Seen a coyote kill itself

too.  Just kept on biting and tearing at

its own legs.  Near tore one clean off

before it bled to death.  And what a white

man'll do when it's freezing one moment,

hot as hell the next. A man could get

hisself killed just for rubbing shoulders

with another (smacking his lips) kiss kissy

kiss. Nice pussy y'see, see it coming. I

don't know what it is about the desert. I

figger it's sort of like putting a kettle

of water over a fire.  People is mostly

water.  We boil when it's hot.  'Cept when

we boil the water's got no place to go.  It

just churns inside of us until we can cool

off.  If it's not too late.

BOBBY

You sure seen a lot for a blind man.

BLIND MAN

Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I

can't see.

BOBBY

That a fact?

BLIND MAN

I can see just fine.  For example:  You're

a young man who thinks he's got someplace

to be.

BOBBY

Maybe I do.

BLIND MAN

Or maybe you just think you do. Just

another small town. One guy chasing you.

You go big town. Just gonna have four guys

after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets

down to one thing -- are you a human being

or are you one of those hungry ghosts out

there never satisfied with nothing? Cause

you gotta remember you can run just as far

as you can, but wherever you go, that's

where you gonna be.

BOBBY

I think I've heard that before.

BLIND MAN

What do you want for free?

BOBBY

You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.

BLIND MAN

Seems like I do but only cause end of the

day we're all eyes in the same head. And

everything is everything.

BOBBY

What?

BLIND MAN

...And everything is nothing too.

BOBBY (shakes his head)

Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner

and spout wise.

BLIND MAN

Think you'll live that long?

BLIND MAN

Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you.

Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see

him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But

that ain't mean I don't know what's going

on around here. They're all cursed. Yes

sir.

BOBBY

Who's cursed?

BLIND MAN

All them miners last century. Hungry

ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at

the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think

I'm fooling around here. White sky was on

fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a

flash, then darkness descended upon me.

They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I

cursed them. White people can't seem to

stay away from Indians (grabs his bandaged

hand, smelling the blood). You gotta watch

where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy

pussy, Indian pussy.

BLIND MAN (finishing)

...but they gotta know you don't fuck

around with Indians.

BOBBY

I thought you said you lost your eyes in

the war?

BLIND MAN

So now you're going to tell me where I lost

my eyes. You don't think I know where I

lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them.

I lost them in the war. The war in the

joint. There's always wars in the joint.

Cause I was a code talker in the joint and

in the war too.(sniffs) Mmmm, nothing like

the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.

BOBBY

Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here

in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.

BLIND MAN

Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's

the curse. The mines done it. All that

uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium,

assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got

a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You

don't rip up the Earth and take everything

out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says,

"the more you eat, the more you

want...."...

BOBBY

I got things to do.

BLIND MAN (offended)

Oh well, go do 'em. You don't see me

stopping you...

BLIND MAN

...But ain't you got a little something for

the infirm?

BOBBY

I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you

next time.

BLIND MAN

Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.

JENNY

Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted

to thank you.

BOBBY

For what?

JENNY

For defending my honor this afternoon.

BOBBY

I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I

wasn't defending you.

JENNY

But you was going to fight for me.

BOBBY

I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was

just going to beat the shit out of your

boyfriend.

JENNY

He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him

take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken

for.  Not yet that is.

BOBBY

Get it through your head, little girl; I'm

not going for you.  If this Toby likes you,

then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're

not going to get much better in this town.

JENNY

That's what I thought until you came riding

in.  I saw your car over at the gas

station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me

for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this

time of day.

BOBBY

How old are you?

JENNY

(beat)

Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in

two years, but that don't mean you can't

take me for a ride if you want.

BOBBY

No, I don't want to take you for a ride.

What I want is for ... Hey, you don't

think you can get $150 from your parents,

could you?

TOBY(O.C.)

Mister!

BOBBY

Oh, shit!

TOBY

That's right, Mister.  You better be

afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you

didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin'

around with my girl behind my back.

BOBBY

I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.

Would you please tell him?

JENNY

You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get

in his fancy car and ride off and leave you

behind.

BOBBY

What the hell are you talking about?

JENNY

What's your name anyway?

TOBY

Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust

you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a

million pieces and then ... and then bust

those pieces up, and then ... and then

spread them all around.  That's what I'm

gonna do.  You don't know what you're

dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm

psycho crazy.

BOBBY

Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like

dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets

hurt. (at his wit's end) All right.  Let's

do this.

JENNY

Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you

beat him all up and knock out all his teeth

and he's just drooling and bleeding all

over hisself, 'cause we love each other and

we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his

love child.

BOBBY

Will you shut up!

TOBY

You gonna pay for that, Mister.

SHERIFF(O.C.)

Toby!

TOBY

Hey, Sheriff Potter.

SHERIFF (tough)

Toby, I just came from your mother's place.

She's worried sick about you.  She says she

ain't seen you since this morning.

TOBY

That ain't true, Sheriff.  I was home for

lunch.

SHERIFF

Boy, I'm not trying to hear nothing from

you except that you're heading home.  Now

run along.

TOBY

Yes, sir.  Come on, Jenny.

JENNY

I want to stay.

TOBY

I said come on!

JENNY

Bye, Mister.  Don't go nowhere without me.

I wanna have your love child.

TOBY

Next time, Mister.  Next time.

SHERIFF

Where ya goin'?

BOBBY

Harlin's.

SHERIFF

Get in.

SHERIFF

Seen you popping up a little bit of

everywhere today.  You're not planning on

staying are you?

BOBBY

No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if

that's what you're worried about.

SHERIFF

That's a nasty cut you got there.

BOBBY

Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad

as it looks.

SHERIFF

There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's

today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he

got whacked around good by one of the

robbers.

BOBBY

Sounds like it. I wish I could help

Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and

get on up the road.

JAKE

Everything all right, Virgil?

SHERIFF (a little nervous)

Just fine, Jake. Where you going?

JAKE

I was just up at Darrell's. How's the wife?

That little eskimo baby walkin' yet?

SHERIFF

Oh just fine.

JAKE

You haven't seen Grace around, have you?

I'm looking for her.

SHERIFF

No. But if I do, I'll tell her you're

looking for her, Jake.

JAKE (looking at Bobby)

Whatcha got there, some trash?

SHERIFF

Peculiar, how things happen. A man's car

breaks down. There's a hold up. People die

and all that money -- and now old Jake out

looking for his young wife. And then you

show up...

SHERIFF

Time's running out, son. I'll be seeing you

in the morning...

DARRELL

Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you

wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so

good.

BOBBY

Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a

bit.

DARRELL

One of those days you feel like you been

runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer

to where you tryin' to get than when you

started?

BOBBY

You've been there?

DARRELL

Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade

with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do

when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.

BOBBY

You believe that?

DARRELL

You think bad, and bad is what you get.

BOBBY

That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.

DARRELL

No charge.

BOBBY

Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty

bucks for the car, as soon as I get where

I'm going I swear I'll--

DARRELL

Two-hundred.

BOBBY

What?

DARRELL

It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.

BOBBY

You said this morning the hose was going to

run me one-fifty.

DARRELL

Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone

I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run

you another fifty.

BOBBY

I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.

DARRELL

Yeah, but it was shot.

BOBBY

I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to

do it!  You can't just do unauthorized

work.

DARRELL

Well, now, you just know all there is about

bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you

read the sign.

BOBBY

What sign?

DARRELL

The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do

unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to

do? Just let you ride out of here with a

bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident

and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna

blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there

goes my reputation.

BOBBY

What reputation?  You're nothing but an

ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.

DARRELL

Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.

BOBBY

Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.

DARRELL

Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe

me money, and this car ain't going nowheres

until I get it.  And if you take another

five hours I'll find another fifty dollars

worth of work to do on it. Is that clear?

Now get out of here 'fore I call the

Sheriff,

who knows me

.

DARRELL

You want to play, Mister?  I'll play with

you.  You want to smash something?  So do

I.

BOBBY

No! Okay! Okay!

DARRELL

What's the matter?  The fight gone out of

you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.

Maybe two.

BOBBY (pleading, almost crying)

Please, just leave the car alone!

DARRELL

Mister, you already pissed me off but good.

BOBBY (about to lose it)

Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!

DARRELL

There you go, sweet talking me again.

BOBBY

Look, Harlin.

DARRELL

Darrell.

BOBBY

Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just

have to get something out of the trunk.

BOBBY

What the fuck did you do to my trunk?

DARRELL

Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to

pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk

key.

BOBBY

And you had to go into the trunk, didn't

you?

DARRELL

When I work on a car, I work on a car.

BOBBY (snaps)

You motherfucker! (etc.)

DARRELL

You can't help yourself, can you mister?

You're out of control.

BOBBY

I need a ticket.

CLERK

Where to?

BOBBY

Out of here.

CLERK

But, in particular?

BOBBY

I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to

Mexico?  That's where I have to go.

CLERK

Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico

would you like--

BOBBY

I don't care, just get me there.

CLERK

How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a

local, arrives in two hours, and transfer

in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the

border.

BOBBY

How much?

CLERK

One way, or round trip?

BOBBY

One way.

CLERK

30.55. Twenty more will get you back.

BOBBY

Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.

CLERK

The ticket is 30.55.

BOBBY (rifling his pockets)

I bought a beer.  That was a dollar

something. Then I gave that girl 25 cents

for the juke box. And the blind man...the

soda...I..I'd have 30 if...if...

CLERK

I'm sorry, sir.  It's $30.55 for the

ticket.

BOBBY (to himself)

Yeah.  Just a little short.  Figures.  I

just wanted to get out, that's all.

BOBBY

Please, ma'am, you don't understand! I

have

to get out of here.  They're going to come

looking for me.

They're going to kill me

.

If I can't get this ticket then I'm going

to have to do things to get out of here.

You know what I mean

! I don't want to hurt

anybody, I just want to leave.

Please

. I

can't...I can't.

CLERK

Okay, I'll give you the ticket, sir,

but...just...just, please calm down,

please!

CLERK

Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three.

Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.

BOBBY

I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...

BOBBY

Holy shit!

SERGEI

Got you, shitface! Bobby Cooper. Bobby

Cooper...

SHERIFF

Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how

they work things in Nevada, but we got

speed limits in this state.

SERGEI

Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am

looking town. I not even moving.

SHERIFF

Whoa, what kind of accent you got there?

You one of them Russians?

SERGEI

I am Russian, da! I am also

rich

Russian,

da? Maybe we work something out, my friend

Sheriff?

SHERIFF

What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just

cause you Russians ain't commies anymore,

don't think money can buy everything...

SHERIFF

What's that? (He grabs the gun)

..."concealed" is a definite no no in this

town, Ivan. You know anything about

Jamilla's grocery store?

SERGEI

What fuckin grocery store, you fucking

shithead idiot! You call yourself a

police...

SHERIFF

Get out of the car, spread them. You can

jawbone all you want or you have the right

to

shut the fuck up

! You commie

motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to

the can.

SERGEI

I want my lawyer!

BOBBY

Ow!

TOBY

Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said

Toby Tucker beat the living shit out of

someone without giving them a fair chance.

BOBBY (gasping)

What the hell are you doing?  You fucking

psycho!

TOBY

I'm doing what any man would do if he'd

been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.

BOBBY

You idiot!  You don't even know what you're

fighting over!

TOBY

My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.

Now get up off the ground, or do I have to

whoop you where you lie?

JENNY

Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!

TOBY

You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him

up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to

see.

JENNY

Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care

what he does to you, we can still be

together.

BOBBY

Get away from me!

TOBY

Now, what's this?

BOBBY

Give it to me!

TOBY

Mexico?  You going to Mexico?

BOBBY

I'm leaving.  You never have to see me

again.  Just please, give me the ticket!

TOBY

This means something to you?  Jenny means

something to me.

BOBBY

Nooo!

TOBY (between bites)

I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be

eatin' nothing but soup the erst of your

days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than

you when I'm done.  I'm gonna mess you up

so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.

I'm gonna ...

JENNY

Stop it!  You're killing him!

JENNY

You're killing him!  Toby!?  Toby!?

JENNY

You killed him! You killed him!

BOBBY

Hello, Grace?  It's Bobby.

INTERCUTS TO:

GRACE (coolly)

I thought you'd be on your way to Vegas by

now.  Is there something you wanted?

BOBBY

I wanted to talk.

GRACE(V.O.)

I don't think we have anything to talk

about.

BOBBY

What about us?

GRACE

There is no us, remember?

BOBBY

Except I can't get you out of my head,

Grace.

(beat)

GRACE

Stop it.

BOBBY (V.O.)

Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the

truth scare you?

GRACE

Because I know you're full of shit.

BOBBY

I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here,

and I want to take you with me.

GRACE (V.O.)

I thought you couldn't get your car.

BOBBY

I could if I had Jake's money.

GRACE (V.O.)

Is that what changed your mind?  The money?

BOBBY

I don't give a damn about the money.  I

want you, and I want to get us out of this

shithole.  There's only one way to do that.

GRACE

Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?

BOBBY

I came back for you; this morning I came

back.  Before I even knew about the money.

You're what I want.

(then)

The only reason I stormed off is because

you spooked me talking about Jake.  But

I've had nothing but time to think about

it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and

us getting the hell out of here.  But we've

got to get the money, baby.  We get the

money, I get the car, then we get the hell

out.

GRACE

You said you couldn't kill anybody.

BOBBY

We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him

out and tie him up 'till we get away.

(beat)

It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this

for you.  I'm doing this so you can

fly...fly like a bird.

BOBBY (V.O.)

Grace ... Grace?

GRACE

After dark.  I'll leave the back door

unlocked.

JAKE

Who was that on the phone?

GRACE

Wrong number.

JAKE

You spent a long time talking for a wrong

number.  But then you make friends so

easily.  Don't you, Grace?

GRACE

I put up new drapes, Jake.

JAKE

I know.  I was here when your apprentice

was helping you.  Remember?

GRACE

You never said anything.  About the drapes.

JAKE

They look nice.

GRACE

You haven't even looked at them once.

JAKE

They look nice.

GRACE

I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought

you would like the colors.

JAKE (softly, admiring)

You look just like your mama when you move

like that against the light.

JAKE

What the hell you looking at, girl?

GRACE

Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.

BLIND MAN

Well, that's it.  Sun's going down.  People

go home, trade stories over dinner.

They'll talk about the day, about the heat,

laugh about something crazy it made them

do.  They'll kiss, sleep a few hours, then

do it all over again.

BOBBY

The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through

it all right.

BLIND MAN (giving back the change)

Keep it.

BLIND MAN (OVER)

Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day;

separate, but equal.  Night is when you let

your guard down; when you see things in the

shadows and hear things in the dark.

BOBBY

Difference between you and me, old man, is

I see the glass half full, you see it half

empty.

BLIND MAN

Night is when you want to sleep, but the

dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.

It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high

in the sky so you could see what it is

you're afraid of.

BOBBY

You afraid of the dark?

BLIND MAN

Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All

cause of a woman who made me this way.

People are afraid of what they can't see.

I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same

to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy

kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp,

slurp, the kiss of death (he makes a

strange sound). It's all the same to me.

BOBBY

So, we're all just floating along like

twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is

that it?

BLIND MAN

More or less.

BOBBY

Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.

BLIND MAN

Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder

than a man's plans. We all got plans. I

planned on seeing all my life. I know you

didn't plan on straying into town.

BOBBY

No and I don't plan on sticking around

either.

BLIND MAN

Well, don't say I didn't warn you when

things go your way.

BOBBY

You got a lotta philosophy in you, old

timer but you don't fool me for one second

with all this blind man crap. One minute

you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's

the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to

you.

BLIND MAN

Used to be a young smartass like you. Then

I got smart with the wrong man's daughter.

Got some acid poured on my peepers for my

trouble. You know human beings ain't always

just human -- they got animals living

inside 'em too...People give spare change

to war heroes not fools. All fools get is

pity. May not have eyes, but I see. And

you, boy?

BLIND MAN

You got my pity.

BOBBY (doesn't believe him)

Hope she was worth it.

BLIND MAN

Oh, she was worth it.  She was worth every

black minute since.

BOBBY

Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?

BLIND MAN

Things ain't always the way they seem. You

got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day

comes Earthmaker is going to look in your

fucking heart! Then you better know what it

is you're doing.

Are you a human being

--

or just one of them hungry ghosts out there

floatin' around?

BOBBY

You

are

crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old

man.

BLIND MAN

You know I won't be seeing you.

as if

he sees

. We don't really know. He reaches into the cup and pulls

BLIND MAN

Cheap bastard. Gives me back my own

money... Well, Jesse, time's up, let's go

for a walk.

JAKE(O.C.)

What the hell you doin', Grace?  Are you

coming to bed, or aren't you?

JAKE

Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You

like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta

go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but

you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't

you, cause you know Daddy's the best.

GRACE

Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.

JAKE

You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my

heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You

betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't

no forgivin' ya, girl!

GRACE

Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!

JAKE

You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's

heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it

away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause

your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost

baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya

alone.

GRACE

No! No! Please!

JAKE

Oh baby, I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry...

(he starts to cry)

I didn't mean to hurt you so bad. It

just...got away...

JAKE

Forgive me, baby, forgive me!

GRACE

What's the matter?

JAKE

You didn't hear something?

GRACE

Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my

ass.

JAKE

There's someone in the house.

GRACE (nervous)

Maybe...maybe the wind blew something over

(encouraging him to continue). Come on

baby, keep going.

GRACE (realizing)

What's that? Jake -- where's you get that?

JAKE

Relax baby. Stay here.

GRACE

Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.

JAKE

Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared

of things...

JAKE

Well, well.  As I live and breathe.  I

didn't expect to be seeing the like of you

again.  Thought you'd be long on your way

by now.

BOBBY

That's my gun...(then) That fucking

Darrell!

JAKE

I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but

he's my half brother. We own Harlin's

together, yeah, that little redneck manages

to get paid no matter how things work out.

BOBBY (realizing)

You been workin' me the whole time.

JAKE

I guess this is what they call "ironee"?

Hunh?

BOBBY

It's not what you think, Jake.

JAKE

No, but it don't matter anyway when you're

lying there with your brains all over my

carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about

this drifter, didn't have enough money to

fix his car. And Darrell happened to find

his gun, and through maybe this drifter

heard old Jake got some money stashed away,

and figgered he might try to break in and

steal it!

BOBBY

Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...

JAKE

...And he thought he'd clock old Jake

McKenna and turn his brains into wall

paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or

$20,000, or $200,000...

BOBBY (very serious)

That's not the reason I'm here, Jake.

JAKE

There's another reason? It better be good.

BOBBY (V.O.)

I came for Grace.

JAKE (V.O.)

You came to take my wife from me?

BOBBY (sincere)

No. I came to kill her.

JAKE (V.O.)

Shhh! Liar.

BOBBY (V.O.)

It's the truth, Jake.

JAKE

That's a thick change of heart from this

afternoon.

BOBBY

Maybe I don't like being played, like she

played us today.  Maybe I don't like that

at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe

I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.

JAKE

You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of

talk.

BOBBY

Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to

kill me, and if it comes down to me or

Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going

to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me

two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the

body where no one will ever find it. She

showed me the perfect place. There won't be

enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the

the money.  I've got to have the money.

JAKE

She's in the bedroom.

BOBBY

Wanna give me my gun?

JAKE

A strangling'll do just fine. Go to work.

BOBBY

How 'bout the pipe?

JAKE (sarcastic)

She's got a slender neck.

JAKE

Hold on a second! Come here!

JAKE

How the hell did you know where the

bedroom's at?

BOBBY

What are you talking about!

JAKE (getting closer)

This morning when I came in on you and

Grace, you swore you hadn't been near the

bedroom. Now you make straight for it.

BOBBY (V.O.)

Come on, Jake --

JAKE (V.O.)

Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You

probably didn't even make it out to the

desert this afternoon...

JAKE

...Or did you just ply the afternoon away

between my sheets putting your lips all

over her, you little horndog...

BOBBY (changing tactics)

What difference does it make if I slept

with her? We're gonna kill her.

JAKE

You're right! I don't give a damn about

her. But killing her's one thing. Fucking

her behind my back, that's another!

JAKE

Now

you've tasted

both

of us!

BOBBY

O.K.! I admit it! I fucked her! But it's

her

you have to worry about, not

me

! She

wants you

dead

, Jake. She wants you

dead

and she wants your money.

JAKE (hesitates)

What are you babbling about?

BOBBY (talking fast)

Think about it! How do you think I got in

here? Did you hear any glass break? Did you

hear a door splinter?

BOBBY (V.O.)

How did the evening end?  After you went to

bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long

enough to leave the door unlocked?  Is that

what happened?

JAKE

You'd tell me anything to save your

pathetic life.

BOBBY

You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake.

You know how badly she wants to get the

fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you,

Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me

kill her.  All I want is two-hundred

dollars to get out of here with.

JAKE

Two-hundred dollars?

BOBBY

Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll

kill her!

JAKE

Sweet Christ, I'd be doing the world a

favor, ridding it of the likes of you. Get

your miserable ass off the floor. You're

positively pathetic... Go on, go kill

Grace.

JAKE

I'm not letting you walk for nothing. Two

hundred dollars. Do it, boy.

Kill her

.

directly behind him

, hatchet raised. His life is in her

SNAP CUT TO:

GRACE

Jake!

JAKE

Grace!!

JAKE

Well...looks like you got him, Grace.

That's good...that's real good.  He must of

slipped past me, but you got him.  Looks

like that drifter from this morning.  Got

to be careful who you make friends with,

sweetheart.

JAKE

Why don't you put that down? It's all over

now.  Put it down.

JAKE

Go on, girl.  Put it down.

JAKE

Aww, that's my Grace:  Not about to let

someone get the best of her.  That's what I

love about you.  As dangerous as you are

unpredictable.

BOBBY

Grace, goddamit, do something!

JAKE

Grace...?

JAKE

Help me, Grace, help...

GRACE

Like you helped her, Jake?

BOBBY

What the hell'd you wait for?

JAKE gasps

, still alive! It is too much for Bobby. He

GRACE

The money's right here! Get the key!

BOBBY

No! You get it!

GRACE

Didn't I tell you?

BOBBY (plunging into the cash)

There must be 150, 200 thousand here!

Goddamnit Grace, you were right!

GRACE

We done it, Bobby. Oh my God!

GRACE

Fuck me baby!

BOBBY (looking at Jake)

What about him?

GRACE

Let him watch. I want him to know what he's

missing.

DARRELL (O.C.)

What you want?

BOBBY

Open up!

DARRELL (O.C.)

We're closed.  Come back when the sun comes

up.

DARRELL

What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've

figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming

over.  What do you want?

BOBBY

I want my car.

DARRELL

You got the money?

DARRELL

Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar

bills.  And this morning you was broke.

BOBBY

That's none of your business.  Get the keys.

DARRELL

I don't want no dirty money.  I run an

honest business.

BOBBY

Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?

DARRELL (pause)

Well, there's a $50 overnight storage

charge we got to talk about.

BOBBY

All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?

DARRELL

No.

BOBBY

Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how

much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.

DARRELL (going to get the keys)

Don't know nothing about no gun.

BOBBY

Course you don't. Tell me something

Darrell. Forty thousand people die every

day! How come none of them are you?

DARRELL (throws him the keys)

I think you know where to find her.

BOBBY

And the trunk key.

DARRELL (pulls out the trunk key)

Topped off the tank for you. No charge.

Just my way of doing business.

BOBBY (jovial, confident now)

Listen up good, Darrell. I'm getting outta

this shithole. You're staying! And one

little peep outta you -- remember that gun

makes you part of the food chain. Your

prints are all over it. I'd be awful

careful whose rectum I was pointing my

finger in, Darrell.

GRACE

Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with

you?

BOBBY

I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on

a rock.  Hurt like hell.

GRACE

I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep

and his caddy in the garage. People'll

think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us

some time...I know a back road we can take.

BOBBY

Good thinking. (looking at her four bags)

What's all this?

GRACE

I'm not coming back.

BOBBY (accepting)

Awright, let's go. I want to be fifty miles

from here before the sun comes up.

GRACE

Funny thing; the jeep wouldn't start. I had

to push it.

BOBBY (dryly)

Funny thing... I'll get the bags.

FADE TO:

BOBBY

I can't see it.

GRACE

It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ...

there!  There it is!

GRACE

Oh, God!  I can't believe it.  I'm out.

I'm finally out!

BOBBY

Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?

GRACE

You don't know what it feels like to be

free of that place.

BOBBY

I don't know about that?

GRACE

You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my

entire life there. I feel like someone just

took a million pounds off my shoulders.

BOBBY

We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.

GRACE

Can't we just dump him fast someplace?

BOBBY

I want a place where only the vultures will

find him...(then) It'll be over soon,

Grace.

GRACE

Then will you take me on your friends' boat

with you?

BOBBY

I'm not sailing his boat.

GRACE

But I thought --

BOBBY

We're going to buy a boat of our own baby,

and sail it wherever we want to go.

GRACE

Anywhere?

BOBBY

What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?

GRACE

Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've

dreamed of going there and just lying on

the beach while the water licked up against

my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.

BOBBY

You already have.

BOBBY

You know I thought you'd left me back

there.

GRACE

What are you talking about?

BOBBY (emotional)

When I got back from the garage, and your

jeep wasn't there, I thought you'd gone and

left me and taken the money.

(off her look)

...Cause I never had any luck with women,

Grace. You don't know what I been through.

The shit I've taken. I thought you were

like the rest of 'em... but when you came

out of the house... well you're here Grace

and we might be starting in the shit but

we're starting where I never been --

together with

someone

-- together with

you

Grace.

GRACE

I love you Bobby.

BOBBY

We're gonna pull this off, Grace.

GRACE

Oh, my God!

(then)

Don't stop!

BOBBY

He must've seen us swerving on the road,

that's all, just gonna give us a ticket for

swerving...

SHERIFF (into loudspeaker)

Pull over, goddamnit, pull over!

GRACE

Keep going!

BOBBY

Fuck this!...Just shut up, Grace. We done

nothing! Be cool. Let me do the talking. He

doesn't know anything.

BOBBY (starts)

'Evening Sheriff, sorry bout that but this

jackrabbit...

SHERIFF

You had to

fuck him

, didn't you!

GRACE (nervous cool)

I would never do that to you, baby... He

killed Jake -- said he'd kill me if I

didn't come with him. All he wants is the

money.

BOBBY

What!

SHERIFF (flipping, yelling)

Don't lie to me

!

GRACE

OK...but he never made me cum! Really

Virgil, I was only doing what I had to do

so we could be free. Just like we talked

about. It meant

nothing

.

BOBBY

You fucking him too Grace? Is everybody

fucking everybody in this town?

SHERIFF

You fuck this guy -- get him to do your

dirty work and you think you can take the

money and dump me?

GRACE

No baby, you got it wrong.

SHERIFF

This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where

were you going to meet me?

GRACE

It's not like that it... Look, Virgil, I

got the money here.

SHERIFF (hurt)

Oh Grace, you can say what you want...but,

I watched you fuck that pervert for years

while you're telling me you loved me? What

happened to going to Milwaukee together?

You and me -- gonna open up the finest

sporting goods store that city ever did

see? Get us a place on the north shore, by

the lake? Season Brewer tickets! Just you

and me, Grace. What happened?

GRACE

All talk, that's all you did was talk, and

all I did was sit around getting older

waiting for you to free me! You never did

nothin' Virgil, you're weak! (pointing to

Bobby)

He did

!

SHERIFF

This is some girl you and me got here

Bobby, yessir, an excellent cocksuck too,

wouldn't you say? (back at Grace)... Course

you had a lotta practice haven't you

darling, going way back to your crazy mama!

GRACE (deadly)

Shut up, Virgil! Take your share of the

money. It's not so bad.

SHERIFF

I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not

gonna give up everything I got for a lousy

50,000 dollars. It's

you

. You

Grace

or

nothing. The whole thing... I want you to

be my wife...(hopeful). What do you way

Grace?

GRACE

You sound just like Jake... I did see into

the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it.

Go back to your family. They love you.

BOBBY (misunderstanding)

Look, we got more. We got $200,000 at

least. Split it three ways, we all walk

away...

SHERIFF

Shut up, boy! You don't know shit round

here! (to Grace) Get back. Did she tell you

that story about the bird flying away?

BOBBY (rolling on the ground)

Ow! Look, I ... ow!

GRACE

Stop! Stop it!

SHERIFF (kicking again and again)

Were you going to help her fly away,

asshole? What'd you think, you were the

first boy to drift through this town she

came on to? She tell you the story about

old Jake forcing her to marry him? That's a

good story... How he killed her crazy Mama?

GRACE

Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!

SHERIFF

...But I bet the story she

didn't

tell you

was the best story of all. How old crazy

Jake

was really her Papa

. And she

liked

fucking Papa! And now she's killed the

sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill

you!

GRACE

No...you! You!

BOBBY

Grace. No!

GRACE

Help me get him off the road. Into the car!

We'll ditch his car... Get the fuck up!

BOBBY (finally)

Jesus, did you have to kill him?

GRACE

Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you

and

me.

BOBBY

He was in love with you Grace. He would've

done what you wanted, you could've made a

deal and ...

GRACE

The only deal he had in mind was killing

you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me

into sucking his dick for the rest of my

life... no thanks.

BOBBY

He was a

cop

, Grace, they never stop

looking for you when you kill a cop...

GRACE

He was a scumbag!... He wanted

me

, Bobby.

These guys don't let go! Even when they're

dead

... (softer) You don't know what it was

like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.

GRACE

So, aren't you going to ask me?

BOBBY

Ask you what? You mean what kind of

horrifying sick shit is coming next?

GRACE

Don't you want to know...? I bet it's

burning a hole in your brain just now?

BOBBY

Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a

past...

GRACE

Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my

Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't

you want to know that?

BOBBY (shouting)

What do you want me to say!

GRACE

Yes! I was! I was fucking Daddy! And I

married him!... I married him...okay?

BOBBY

Why?

GRACE

I don't know why

!

GRACE

All I wanted was to be a kid... He took

that from me... They all did... (very

quietly, dangerously) They treated me like

meat. A piece of meat.

Fuck me

.

Blow me

.

Bend over

.

Stick their fingers up my ass

...

Fuck them! Fuck the whole town! They

deserved to die!

BOBBY

And us Grace? What do we deserve?

GRACE (crying quietly to herself)

"Nin chonk, nin chonk," my Mama used to say

in Apache. "Your worst is doing this to

you," she said, "your worst has killed

you." And "Be go tsee" -- "you will find

out the result of what you have done..."

Just when you think it's over, when you've

gotten away, it begins. Cause you never get

away.

GRACE

It's easy to judge someone else when you

don't know nothing about it... I'm Apache,

Bobby. You don't eat what I eat. You don't

see what I see. Don't judge me.

BOBBY

I don't want to think anymore.

GRACE (quietly)

Then drive...

THE SUN COMES UP:

D.J. (V.O.)

...Nobody's sure where it was heading so

fast but the way it hit the semi, it won't

be getting home now! Hey area weather is

gonna be hot! Hot! Hot! Then cold! Cold!

Cold! Just like yesterday. Just like every

day. Some surprise, huh? So if you're

planning on anything,

don't

. You don't like

the weather, just wait one minute. Got any

brains, get up to Alaska and get yourself

some trailer park where you don't see no

desert for miles and miles...

BOBBY (over)

Right there... Drop it there. I got it.

GRACE

See ya, Virgil. God bless.

GRACE (indicates the gun)

Is this what's bothering you Bobby?

BOBBY

No Grace, my hand's bothering me.

GRACE

You think now that Jake's dead, there's all

that money there and I don't need you

anymore, and I might just sneak up behind

you sometime and...pop!

GRACE

Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted

to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?

BOBBY

You could give me my gun back.

GRACE

Why don't we just finish what we started.

GRACE (after a moment with Jake)

What do you think happens to someone's

spirit when they die?

BOBBY

I think nothing happens. You're dead meat.

That's it.

GRACE

You don't believe in anything do you,

Bobby?

BOBBY

I believe in this moment, that's all. There

is nothing else.

(lifting Jake by the shoulder)

Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.

GRACE

You hit me, Bobby? You hit a woman, you

motherfucker! Didn't your Momma ever teach

you anything...?

GRACE

Well?

BOBBY

Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the

money, then you're on your own.

GRACE

Don't leave me. I want to say with you,

Bobby.

BOBBY

Why? So when the cops catch up with us you

can sell me out again?

GRACE

I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to

tell him that to get his guard down. Just

like you told Jake you was going to kill

me!

BOBBY

You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies.

Your mother, your father, what story are

you on now?  How come the town didn't know

you was his daughter?

GRACE (in pain)

Cause my Mom slept around. A lotta men!

Anybody could've been my father. But

we

knew

.

BOBBY (not listening)

Well you got what you wanted all along by

fucking me.  I wish you had told me the

goddamn truth in the first place!

GRACE (screws out)

I didn't

want

you to know! Don't you...

unnerstand?

BOBBY

When you're finished with me, I'm next! I

been there, baby. I been there with other

cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you

as far as California. If we can make that.

After that you're on your own. Try Mexico.

With all this bread, you can live like a

queen.

GRACE

I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby!

Please, I really want to be with you. Don't

blow this. Don't you think I care about

you?

BOBBY

I think you're a lying, back-stabbing

psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me.

But it's nice to know you cared...

GRACE

You don't know your own mind. It blocks

your heart.

BOBBY

Give me a hand.

BOBBY

Poor old Jake, a few drinks, a fight with

the sheriff over his wife. And both of 'em

ended up dead.

BOBBY

Time to go for a walk, Jake.

GRACE

My mother died in this canyon.

BOBBY

Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It

doesn't work with me. One, two, three...

BOBBY

Look, it's not so bad we split up. It might

be months before they find these guys. If

at all. I mean with the mountain lions

around here. Remember, if they can't find

no bodies, there's no crime... (She doesn't

respond.) We'll be in Phoenix by noon. Lose

this car, get another one. Texas, Mexico

are big countries, all that money Grace,

you'll meet someone else, you know, there's

a lot of hope with a $100,000...

GRACE

Hope is a four-letter word.

BOBBY

But we all need that too. Hold him.

BOBBY

You make a pretty couple.

BOBBY

Won this in a poker game in Reno. God knows

who it's registered to.  You shoulda been

more careful, Jake. See you later.

BOBBY

Now all we got to do is try

and

--

GRACE

Shit!

BOBBY

Grace! Help me, Grace...! We been through

too much together.  We've only had one day,

but you and me have been through more than

most people ever will. I know you were

angry at me, and, you know, you were right!

I'm sorry I hit you. I was wrong about

leaving you. You don't belong in Mexico.

BOBBY

Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you

wouldn't leave me, Grace.

GRACE

Bobby? Are you all right?

BOBBY

I busted my leg!

GRACE

Can you make it back up?

BOBBY

Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow

rope. It should reach down here. Go get it,

throw it down.

GRACE

Bobby, the trunk...it's locked. Throw the

keys up to me. I'll get the rope.

BOBBY

I can't throw that far. You got to climb

down here and get the keys. You can make

it. It's the only way Grace.

BOBBY

Grace!...Please, Grace!  You have to help

me.

GRACE

Okay. I'm coming. Calm down!

BOBBY (off)

I knew you'd help me. I knew you wouldn't

leave me baby, cause we're tied together

too close. We belong together always.

GRACE (yelling back, echoing)

Bobby! Don't flip out on me. I can't do

this alone. I know you don't trust me, but

you gotta pull yourself together, I'm not

gonna leave you...I never wanted it to go

down like this. It was different with you

Bobby. You had dreams like me. You

listened... I would've gone anywhere with

you, Bobby. We can make this work. I'm

sorry...I really am. I didn't wanna hurt

you.

BOBBY (as he crawls)

They're right here, Grace.  The keys.  Come

get me out of here... Know why else I could

never leave you?

GRACE

Why's that?

BOBBY

'Cause I love you.

GRACE

And I love you too.

BOBBY

And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I

don't know if I want to love you...

BOBBY

...

or kill you

.

BOBBY

I love you Grace, but

I just can't trust

you

!

GRACE

Jake

...

BOBBY

He

can't

help you now, honey!

BOBBY

You're still lucky.

BOBBY (waves back)

Adios --

BOBBY (sighs)

Oh shit!...(then) Arizona.

THE END
