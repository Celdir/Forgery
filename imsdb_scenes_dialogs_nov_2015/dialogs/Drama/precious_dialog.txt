A line at a time, the following quote appears over a black

screen.

Every blade of grass has its Angel

that bends over it and whispers,

"Grow, grow."

1   EXT HARLEM STREET  DAY                                          1

A COLD WIND blows a bright red scarf tangled high on a street

lamp.

An iron waste bin is blown sideways into an intersection. A

stray dog investigates it briefly, urinates and then moves on.

A book bag drops onto the pavement.

Visible from the waist down, a LARGE YOUNG WOMAN in a

disintegrating leather jacket turns the waste bin upright and

then maneuvers it onto the sidewalk.

Once finished, her thick hands wipe each other until they

stop abruptly.

Here, for the first time, we see her PLUMP, YOUTHFUL, VACANT

AFRICAN AMERICAN FACE. It is 16-YEAR-OLD PRECIOUS JONES.

Something inside the bin has caught her attention.

Precious gazes down upon a soiled and tattered paperback book

as the breath from her nostrils steams. The title of the book

staring back up at her is unintelligible.

She pushes debris aside to get to it.

The book plunges deeper into the trash, as if trying to flee.

The sound of an ONCOMING CAR approaches.

Precious pins the book against the bottom of the bin as the

sounds of the oncoming car close in.

Precious finally comes up with the book. Its title is still

unintelligible. When she flips it over, however, the letters

on the cover, which are facing us now, make sense. They read

CRYSTAL STAIR: SELECTED WORKS BY LANGSTON HUGHES.

The car sounds incredibly close.

Precious looks sharply to her left.

AN EERIE SKID precedes an eerier THUD! Precious, almost hit,

falls back on to the pavement as her book skips across the

intersection and down into a drain.

She lays on the sidewalk pressed against the base of the

street lamp with her eyes closed.

The car reverses, skids, stops for a sec, shifts and

SCREECHES off.

The garbage bin, overturned yet again, rocks side to side

until settling, to a stop.

An ambulance eases up to the intersection.

When the stoplight changes, the ambulance motors past

Precious in no hurry. A moment later, its sirens BLARE and it

speeds off into the distance.

The stray dog returns, re-investigates the garbage bin, and

turns to Precious. He licks her face. Tom Cruise walks up to

her.

Precious' still vacant eyes finally open to see Tom, and the

red scarf falling from the street lamp towards her. Tom gives

her a hand up.

TOM

(flirtatious)

What's your name girl?

Precious blushes.

TOM

What's your name?

Precious still blushing, looks on the ground.

FADE TO BLACK.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

My name is Precious Jones. I wanna

take tap dance lessons. Mama said

we can't afford it.

A SCHOOL BELL RINGS.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Precious sits in the last row behind 26 children half her

size, 3 years younger and mostly African American. Noise and

projectiles fill the air.

MR. WICHER -A FRAIL MAN IN A BOW TIE AND TWEED COAT, stands

at the head of the class trying to establish order.

MR. WICHER

Class, would you please turn to

page 122 ...Class! 122!

Precious' book stays closed as the other students find the

page.

TWO BOYS in front of Precious giggle boisterously at some

private joke.

Mr. Wicher looks annoyed but accustomed to this.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

I like maff but I don't say nuffin'

-don't open my book even. Just sit

there.

The giggling boys continue their shenanigans.

MR. WICHER

Boys?

The boys finally open their books.

MR. WICHER

Page 122 please.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Everyday I tell myself something

gonna happen, like I'm gonna break

through or somebody gonna break

through to me -I'm gonna learn,

catch up, be normal, sit in the

front ...someday.

The giggling flares up again. Precious sneers at the boys.

MR. WICHER

Today we are going to review

Monday's assignment. Would anyone

like to begin?

The boys get louder.

Mr. Wicher looks at them helplessly.

MR. WICHER

Boys! ! !

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

I like Mr. Wicher. I pretend he my

husband and we live in Weschesser,

whereever that is. I can see by his

eyes Mr. Wicher like me too. I wish

I could tell him all the pages in

my book look the same to me, but I

can't..

BOY# 1

Excuse you?!

The entire class cries, "OOOOOH". Mr. Wicher looks scared.

BOY # 1

Nobody 'spect us to learn nuffin no

way. Now I'm tryin' to have a

motherfuckin' conversation back

here if you don't mind Mr. Bitcher,

I mean, Mr. Wicher.

The boys fallout slapping hands.

The class turns to Mr. Wicher in unison to see what he will

do.

MR. WICHER

I want to see you boys after class.

BOY# 2

Sorry Mr. Wicher but you ain't my

type. Grow some tits.

MR. WICHER

Just be quiet.

Mr. Wicher tries to carry on throughout the boys' unrelenting

defiance. Other students are continually distracted by the

boys. Precious looks bothered the most as Mr. Wicher's soft

voice loses the battle.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

I feels sorry for Mr. Wicher. He do

his best but he ain't got no voice.

He scared too. I feels sorry for

him.

The boys break out in RIOTOUS LAUGHTER until ...

CRASH! A desk slams against the floor. The boys whirl around

to see two large hands take hold of them and snatch them out

of their chairs.

Precious has had enough.

PRECIOUS

Shut up motherfuckers, I'm trying

to learn something! Hard enuff

wiffout you stupid clowns carryin'

on!

BOY# 1

(trembling)

...sorry Precious.

BOY# 2

(trembling)

We cool.

Precious shoves them down in their seats and huffs.

PRECIOUS

Stupid asses... Go on 'bout cha

lesson Mr. Wicher. They ain' gonna

give you no more trouble today.

Precious turns her desk upright and sits back down. Mr.

Wicher looks grateful.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

I'm like the polices for Mr.

Wicher. Tha's why I can't be late

to maff.

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Someone is outside the classroom.

Mr. Wicher waves her inside.

MRS. LICHENSTEIN, A SKINNY WOMAN IN HER THIRTIES WEARING A

DARK SKIRT SUIT enters, squints to find Precious, points

briefly and then whispers something to Mr. Wicher. Precious

rolls her eyes.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Now dis ...

Mrs. Lichenstein sends Precious an oversized grin and beckons

to her.

MRS. LICHENSTEIN

CORNROWS

Each One Teach One is an

alternative school and an

alternative school is like a

choice, a different way to do

something.

PRECIOUS

Oh.

CORNROWS

You need your discharge papers from

your old school saying they have

formally discharged you or we can't

allow you in the program.

I got kicked out 'cause I was

pregnant.

You still need formal discharge

papers or we can't let you in. It's

your records over was just a way of

speeding things up for you.

PRECIOUS

Can I start today?

CORNROWS

Yup. The only other thing we need

right now is income verification.

Are you currently receiving AFDC?

I got to go get all that now?

CORNROWS

No, relax. We're just gonna give you

math level, see where to place you.

PRECIOUS

What's the difference?

CORNROWS

Well, to enter G.E.D. classes a

student should be able to read on

an eighth-grade level. They should

score 8.0 or better on the TABE

reading test.

I was in ninfe grade at I.S. Ill.

Precious lunges for a trash bin into which she promptly

vomits.

She quickly catches her breath. Wipes her mouth and looks 10

feet away at a brightness coming from an open doorway. Her

HEART BEATS loudly.

Precious stands up. She seems to be there for a considerable

A blur of a young girl darts into the room from the other end

Ms. Rain's desk sits before six smaller ones situated in a

semi-circle. Four of them are occupied by girls roughly

Precious' age:

FACE AND DRESSED ENTIRELY IN BLACK, JERMAINE HICKS WIRY,

LEAN, SEATED AND DRESSED LIKE A BOY and CONSUELO MONTENEGRO -

LATIN DESCENT, PETITE GLOWING AND GORGEOUS. She twirls her

hair incessantly with slender painted fingertips.

A seventh desk sits well apart from the others back beneath

the windows.

The girls all stare up at Precious blankly as she enters the

room. Precious looks to be in a mild state of shock as she

gazes around from the girls to Ms. Rain to the clouds outside

the windows.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

First thing I wonder is where is

everybody -the boyz, the noises

...this feel like a Sunday school

or crazy house...or something like

bof' but different. Smell different

too.

Precious' eyes land on the lone desk in the rear of the room.

MS. RAIN (O.S.)

Precious looks from the distant desk to one up front and then

back to the distant desk.

She sits with the other girls delicately, as if she were a

visitor in a complete stranger's home.

Ms. Rain slams the phone down, shakes her head, finds another

number on the wall and then dials again while speaking to

Precious.

MS. RAIN

Before this day is up, you will

have a place to live Precious.

Ms. Rain suspends her frustration with a brief smile as she

waits for the other end of the line to pick up.

104   INT. CLASSROOM - DAY                                     104

Jo Ann saunters in.

The other girls are writing already.

Rhonda is at the head of the class displaying unusually good

posture.

RHONDA

(looking at her watch)

Jo Ann, you late.

JO ANN

You ain't the teacher.

RHONDA

I am today. Miz Rain busy wif

Precious.

JO ANN

(thrilled)

Alright!!!

(concerned)

How Precious?

105   INT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY                                  105

Ms. Rain hangs up the phone.

She looks tired.

PRECIOUS

They have ...something. It's an

immediate opening and it's in

Queens.

Precious looks concerned.

PRECIOUS

Queens?

MS. RAIN

Yeah. Queens ...What do you think?

PRECIOUS

(beat)

I don't really know Queens.

MS. RAIN

Me either. You should stay in

Harlem...long as we can anyway.

Ms. Rain takes an organizer from her bag, looks for another

number and picks up the phone.

MS. RAIN

I have this West Indian friend whose

boyfriend is a council member.

(with uncertainty)

We'll see what they can do...

106   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                       106

Precious exits the girls bathroom carrying Abdul. She sports

a new sweat suit.

She pauses before entering Each One Teach One Reception Area

and observes Ms. Rain speaking on the phone for a moment.

Suzanne, the school's administrator stands by.

MS. RAIN

...C-L-A-I-R-E-E ...

WOMAN'S VOICE

Hey Precious.

Precious jumps and turns around to find Cornrows passing by.

PRECIOUS

Hi Miss Lisa.

CORNROWS

(still moving)

How you been?

PRECIOUS

Good. How you been?

CORNROWS

I don't know... I went to see that

movie Barfly last night... That piece

PRECIOUS

Thanks.

Ms. Rain still on the phone.

MS. RAIN

Ms rain places the call on hold.

MS. RAIN

I think   I may be onto something.

(to   Precious)

Come on   Precious.

Precious and Ms. Rain walk back to her classroom.

107   INT. CLASSROOM - DAY                                      107

Ms. Rain and Precious enter the classroom as the girls write

studiously. Rhonda supervises in a staid manner. Clearly she

is enjoying her new appointment.

How do you spell "Aquarius"?

JO ANN

What you want to spell that for?

JERMAINE

A-Q-U-A-R-I-U-S.

RITA

Is that right?

JERMAINE

Of course it's right. I'm one of

CONSUELO

I wonder can you spell "boy" then.

JERMAINE

I wonder can you spell "slut" then.

CONSUELO

Maybe, but I bet Miss Lisa can.

108   INT. MS. RAINS OFFICE - DAY                              108

Ms. Rain picks up the line holding.

MS. RAIN

Yes Brenda. Thank you.

Ms. Rain hangs up the phone, turns to Precious and exhales.

MS. RAIN

They can take you. Tomorrow...at a

place here in Harlem.

Precious looks relieved.

MS. RAIN

You just need somewhere to stay

tonight.

You don't snore do you?

Precious smiles.

109   INT. MS. RAIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                           109

Precious sits at a small kitchen table in a modest but cozy

and craftily-decorated apartment. Fresh flowers adorne her

table.

She breast feeds Abdul and drinks from a tall glass of grape

juice. Ms. Rain clears the table of plates and take-out

containers.

WHITNEY HOUSTON IS PLAYING LOUD. KATHERINE, A SEXY BLACK

WOMAN who it seems has just awoken, descends the stairs.

She's not in a good mood.

KATHERINE

Honey, how many times did I tell

you about the music?

She stops in mid sentence when she sees precious. Her mood

changes.

KATHERINE

(warmly)

You must be Precious. Hi.

Katherine bends down to admire Abdul.

MS. RAIN

Precious, this is my wife

Katherine.

Precious looks confused. She spits her drink out. A lot of

which lands on Abdul.

She wipes Abdul.

PRECIOUS

Huh?

MS. RAIN

I said that this is my wife

Katherine.

Precious' mouth is agape.

PRECIOUS

...Oh...

What's his name? He's adorable.

PRECIOUS

KATHERINE

He looks just like you.

PRECIOUS

Thanks.

Y'all really married?

MS. RAIN

Yes Precious. Very much.

Precious still looks confused.

CUT TO:

110   INT. MS. RAIN'S APARTMENT                                    110

The ladies lounge around the living room. Ms. Rain and

Katherine hold glasses of wine. Precious still looks as if

she's trying to keep up.

KATHERINE

...Ask yourself. Just ask yourself;

if Ronald McDonald were running the

show and the price of hamburgers

skyrocketed, wouldn't you be

suspicious?

MS. RAIN

I just think you should finish the

book.

KATHERINE

Who's gonna read it?

MS. RAIN

Nobody if you don't write it.

Precious writes everyday. You

should try it.

KATHERINE

What do you write about Precious?

PRECIOUS

I don't know. Stuff in my life.

Abdul.

How come y'all don't like McDonalds?

MS. RAIN

Katherine was just drawing a

comparison so that her point could

be more easily understood...

PRECIOUS (V.O.)                        MS. RAIN

Together, these homo ladies        It's called an analogy. For

talk like TV channels I don't      example, my uncle Clayton

watch. I'm glad Abdul here to      used to smoke like a chimney

listen in on 'em tho cause I       and drink like a fish before

know they smart.                   he got saved.

An Etta James tune begins ...

CUT TO:

Ms. Rain and Katherine, high from the wine, spin each other

lazily in a playful dance.

Precious sits watching carefully. She lifts and smells the

gardenias from the table.

Precious starts to pour a bottle of wine into her glass.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Mama say homos is bad peoples ...

A hand intercepts the bottle. It is Ms. Rain's. She then

pours it into her own glass and takes the bottle with her as

she returns to Katherine.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

...But homos not who rape me, homos

not who let me sit up in school 16

years and learn nuffin and homos not

sell crack to peoples in Harlem. I

wonder what Oprah have to say about

that?

Ms. Rain looks over to Precious.

MS. RAIN

You okay Precious?

Precious nods.

PRECIOUS

Y' all watch Oprah?

Ms. Rain gives her a loving smile.

Ms. Rain and Katherine continue dancing in the window as

Precious observes.

The evening cityscape sparkles around them.

112    INT. HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY                          112

Streamers hang from the walls. Various handwritten versions

of "Congratulations Precious", obviously written by the

girls, stretch across the blackboard in uneven-sized letters.

Precious stands beside Ms. Rain holding a small trophy and a

check. The other girls flank them standing very straight. All

wear big grins.

FLASHPWOOWF!

Nurse John, without his uniform, has just taken a picture of

everyone.

The girls go straight for the cookies and punch waiting atop

an orange tablecloth on Ms. Rain's desk. They begin a Soul

Train Line and dance around the desk as Nurse John approaches

Ms. Rain to converse.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

After I settle in halfway house, I

work my hardest to memorize letter

sounds, write in journal and read

smaller and fatter books. Then I

find out Mayor's office give me

Literacy Award and check for

progress. Everybody at the party,

Nurse John, Cornrows and the staff

stop in too, but they need to get

back to they desks before too long.

Whole operation can't stop just

cause Miss Precious get a trophy.

Even Ms. Katherine shows.

John discreetly beckons Precious over to the side as she

blows into a noisemaker. Both she and John dance in high

spirits.

then opens it.

It is a leather bound journal with blank pages. Precious

flips through it.

PRECIOUS

Thanks Nurse John.

They exchange a familiar, moderately complicated handshake.

JOHN

You're welcome. What are you gonna

do with your award money?

PRECIOUS

I owe the chicken place for a

bucket that I swiped last year.

Thas first. After that, get some

thangs for Abdul.

JOHN

You know Blu?

PRECIOUS

Miz Rain?

JOHN

Yeah.

Precious holds up two intertwined fingers.

PRECIOUS

Like dis.

JOHN

Well she has, has she uh...got a

man?

PRECIOUS

...No.

JOHN

Well I was hoping you could put in

the good word.

PRECIOUS

The good word...wif Ms. Rain?

JOHN

Yeah, that's what I'm trying to

John looks confused.

113   INT. HOTEL THERESA CORRIDOR - DAY                           113

Precious leads John down the hall by the hand.

She stops in front of Cornrows' desk as Cornrows converses on

the phone while picking her nails.

The previously illegible sign on her desk now reads "EACH ONE

TEACH ONE".

CORNROWS

(on the phone noticing

Precious)

Hold on girl.

Cornrows lowers the phone and waits for Precious to speak.

PRECIOUS

Miss Lisa this Nurse John. Nurse

John this Miss Lisa.

Cornrows looks up at John.

Precious heads back to the party. Nurse John and Cornrows

watch her curiously.

PRECIOUS (O.S.)

Y'all work it out.

Nurse John and Cornrows turn to each other.

JOHN

Hi ...How are you?

Cornrows looks him up and down then hangs up the phone

without looking.

CORNROWS

I get off at 4.

114   INT. CLASSROOM - DAY                                        114

The room is empty except for Ms. Rain standing on a chair

taking streamers down.

Precious appears in the doorway and studies Ms. Rain a moment

as if seeing her for the first time.

Ms. Rain steps down from her chair looking tired.

Precious enters the room.

MS. RAIN

Precious, I thought you went home.

PRECIOUS

Not yet. I forgot to say thank you

for my party.

MS. RAIN

You're welcome. It was my pleasure.

Precious just watches her.

MS. RAIN

Was there something else?

PRECIOUS

I ...No...

MS. RAIN

Are you sure?

PRECIOUS

Well, I was thinking...

MS. RAIN

Yes?

PRECIOUS

You talk to us girls in the class

when we be working out problems and

thangs and stuff, right?

Ms. Rain speaks to Precious while picking up around the room.

MS. RAIN

Mm hm...

PRECIOUS

Well, who do you talk to?

Caught off guard, Ms. Rain looks at Precious curiously.

PRECIOUS

Or you probably don't have no

problems so...

MS. RAIN

Everybody has those Precious.

MS. RAIN

Ms. Rain abruptly stops what she's doing. Precious looks

alarmed.

MS. RAIN

Precious looks both confused and relieved. Ms. Rain sits

while motioning for Precious to do the same.

PRECIOUS

(sitting)

Me? I never...

Precious stops as Ms. Rain looks away as if gathering her

thoughts.

Finally...

MS. RAIN

Last night I had a conversation

with my mother, and that never

happens cause our relationship

is.... complicated. We don't speak,

and when we do, it always ends in a

fight about my filthy misguided

existence. Most times I feel

terrible for days afterwards

wondering whether all the hateful

things she said are true. Those

days I just feel like...like...

PRECIOUS

Nuffin?

MS. RAIN

...Yeah. I didn't feel so bad this

time though.

(beat)

Cause this time I thought about how

strong you've had to be and then I

decided that I had nothing to be

ashamed of and that my mother was

wrong about me, my dad and 5 or 6

hundred other things. You ask if

you can help me? Baby, you already

have.

PRECIOUS

...For real?

MS. RAIN

That's the for real, hope to die if

I'm lying truth. Now shouldn't you

Suit yourself.

Ms. Rain motions to the other end of a long folding table.

Precious takes hold of it and they carry it across the room

together.

As we watch from a distance...

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Some folks got a light around them

that shine for other peoples. I

think maybe some of them was in a

long tunnel before. And in that

tunnel, maybe the only light they

had was one that was inside of them

and then -even long after they

escaped that tunnel, they still be

shining for everybody else. Thas

Miz Rain to me.

115   INT. ADVANCEMENT HOUSE: PRECIOUS' ROOM - DAY                115

Precious' trophy sits on the windowsill beneath a thin a

layer of dust.

A stack of books sit on her bureau.

Colorful letters and numbers hang on the wall. Beneath them

hang postcards featuring Zora Neal Hurston, Alice Walker,

Maya Angelou and Oprah Winfrey.

Abdul sleeps in his crib.

Precious makes her bed.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

In a book I read, a lady escaped to

a 1/2 way house. And the lady, she

asked the people there just what a

1/2 way house was. They tole her,

you is 1/2 way between the life you

had and the life you want to have

...Thas nice. That also mean I

can't stay here forever and that

there is still a ways to go. It be

something to get apartment of my

own.

A larger Abdul steps towards us with Precious behind him

wearing a cotton dress that looks vaguely like one Ms. Rain

might wear.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Abdul nine months old and walking!

Smart too. I been reading to him

since the day he was born almost.

Barely talkin' and he countin' .

Precious plays with Abdul in the shallow end of the community

swimming pool.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Mama, Daddy, I.S. III and 444 Lenox

life or some old bad dream. I wish

I could have started out from here

but still wif Abdul and poor Mongo.

Precious looks out of her open window with a glass of water

in her hand.

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

PRECIOUS

Come in...

Precious closes her window.

The door to her room opens. CHELSEA, A 30-S0METHING SOCIAL

WORKER steps in looking slightly uncomfortable.

CHELSEA

CHELSEA

Precious stops.

119   INT. ADVANCEMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY                        119

Precious descends a staircase to a long corridor clearly deep

in thought every step of the way.

She stops momentarily to straighten her clothes.

When she finally reaches a day room at the other end of the

hall, she looks through its window for a moment.

Mary sits inside crushing and dwarfing the couch upon which

she waits. She looks frail. Her wig is half combed. She's

nervous. Her sweaty hands crumple her cigarette package.

Precious covers her nose a moment, lowers her hand, readies

herself and then steps into the room.

120   INT. DAY ROOM - DAY                                         120

Once inside the room, and for the first time, Precious' soft

face looks like stone.

Mary looks up with a brief but quickly fading smile that is

pathetic, apologetic and grim.

Precious waits.

The air is thick without a single word between them.

Finally, Mary looks down.

MARY

Your daddy dead.

Precious looks surprised for a moment but still composed.

Mary waits for a response.

PRECIOUS

Carl ...Carl had that AIDS virus.

A previously unseen woman sitting across the room looks up

from behind a newspaper.

Precious stays stone-faced until she finally GASPS as the

aftershock of the revelation hits her squarely.

The man across the room collects his hat and coat and leaves.

INSERT -GLIMPSES OF CARL REMOVING HIS BELT, CARL THRUSTING ON

TOP OF PRECIOUS, PRECIOUS FOLLOWING ABDUL TAKING EARLY STEPS.

We return to the dayroom as Precious opens her eyes and lifts

them to Mary slowly.

PRECIOUS

MARY

Got what?

PRECIOUS

The AIDS virus.

MARY

No.

PRECIOUS

How you know?

MARY

We never did, you know...

PRECIOUS

No, I don't know Mama.

MARY

We never did what you got to do to

get it.

PRECIOUS

MARY

Yeah...but not like faggots, in

Precious is speechless. It looks as if some of her anger has

suddenly been displaced with pity.

Mary looks up delicately.

MARY

You welcome back home.

PRECIOUS

Mary doesn't move as Precious leaves.

Mary sits staring at the floor at the far side of the room.

121   INT. ADVANCEMENT HOUSE: PRECIOUS' ROOM - DAY                121

Precious enters, takes Abdul from his crib, holds him closely

and sits on her bed.

Moments later, a TAPPING on the window draws her attention.

Precious rises to find Tom Cruise hurling pebbles up at her

window in a leather jacket.

A MOTORCYCLE sits a few feet away from him.

He beckons her.

She stares down at him with solemn eyes.

Tom finally mounts his bike and vanishes into thin air while

revving its engine.

Mary then crosses the frame where he was.

Precious turns to Abdul and kisses him on the head.

Ms. Rain stands before the blackboard with a piece of chalk

written behind her.

Consuelo is missing and TWO NEW GIRLS, AISHA, INDIAN AND FROM

GUYANA AND BUNNY, VERY THIN WITH BAD TEETH have joined the

MS. RAIN

Rita, what do I mean when the

author describes her protagonist's

circumstances as "unrelenting"?

RITA

I don't know Miz Rain.

MS. RAIN

C'mon Rita, think about the

question before you just give up

Ms. Rain's voice trails off as we find Precious lost in

thought.

Her eyes say everything.

The counselor places a hand on top of Precious'.

Precious waits a moment and then shakes her head without

looking up.

Ms. Rain goes to her desk and picks up the journal without

resistance.

The words "Why me?" sit alone on the page with lines crossed

through them. Ms. Rain returns the journal to Precious' desk

still opened to the same page.

MS. RAIN

Precious, would you come to my

office for a moment?

Precious doesn't respond.

The class still watches curiously.

Ms. Rain, steps back, sits on the edge of her desk and folds

her arms.

MS. RAIN

Preci-

PRECIOUS

Nurse say I am H.I.V. positive.

The air changes sharply.

Everything stops.

Precious exhales.

PRECIOUS

I don't have nuffin to write today

and I don't hate no one. Not even

my muhver. My head is all dark

inside so I don't have nuffin to

write today...Maybe nuffin never.

Rita rises, walks to Precious and embraces her. Tears well in

Precious' eyes.

91.

125   CONTINUED: (2)                                             125

Still trying to stay composed, Precious wipes her face.

Ms. Rain rises, walks to Precious and rubs her back as she

looks around to the other girls who are still stunned.

RHONDA

Your baby okay?

The class waits on pins and needles. Precious doesn't answer

at first and just looks down until ...

PRECIOUS

Yeah. He good...Won't bress feed

him no more to be safe.

MS. RAIN

(to Precious)

One time in your journal you told

me that you had never really told

your story.

(softly)

write.

Precious' eyes well up some more.

She wipes her face again.

PRECIOUS

What for? How?! I feel like I am

drowning inside a giant river Miz

Rain. Thas what...

Precious stops herself abruptly as if being overwhelmed by a

sense of futility.

MS. RAIN

I think telling your story will get

you over that river Precious ...

Precious erupts hurling her journal sharply across the room.

It bounces hard off the blackboard and stops abruptly on the

floor facedown.

PRECIOUS

FUCK YOU! YOU DON'T KNOW NUFFIN

WHAT I BEEN THROUGH!!! I NEVER HAD

NO BOYFRIEND! MY DADDY SAY HE GONNA

MARRY ME BUT HOW HE DO THAT,

FUCKING ME ILLEGAL? I NEVER BEEN NO

CHILD! NOT EVEN ONE DAY!!!

The class looks shocked. Precious' wet eyes are filled with

fury.

(CONTINUED)

92.

125   CONTINUED: (3)                                           125

A moment later, Ms. Rain walks calmly across the room,

retrieves the journal and places it back on top of Precious'

desk.

MS. RAIN

Open your notebook Precious.

PRECIOUS

(exasperated)

I'm tired Miz Rain!

MS. RAIN

I know you are but you can't stop

now. You gotta fight through this.

You still have to live your life

and do the best you can with the

hand you've been dealt. If not for

yourself then for the people who

love you.

Precious HUFFS cynically.

PRECIOUS

Nobody love me. Thas a lie.

MS. RAIN

People do love you Precious.

PRECIOUS

Please don't lie Miz Rain! Love?!

Me?! Love rape me, beat me, call me

animal, get me sick and make me

feel wurfless. I had enough love.

MS. RAIN

That wasn't love. There are people

in this room who love you. Your

child loves you too. Is that clear

Precious? Now if Rita decided to

just give up? Would you let her?

Precious doesn't answer.

MS. RAIN

Would you?!

PRECIOUS

(reluctantly)

No.

MS. RAIN

And why not?!

(CONTINUED)

93.

125   CONTINUED: (4)                                            125

Precious doesn't answer.

MS. RAIN

Because you love her...as much as

she loves you.

Precious looks to her side and finds Rita smiling

reassuringly through her crooked teeth.

MS. RAIN

Now the rest of the world can judge

you, cheat you, beat you, dismiss

you and abandon you all it wants

but we won't let you give up and

that's the only thing that matters.

Some people have less than that on

their side and still manage to keep

going.

(beat)

It's up to you.

Precious thinks a long moment, wipes her face and exhales.

She doesn't move for what seems like ages.

The whole class watches her until Ms. Rain motions for them

to continue working. Finally, Precious takes hold of her pen,

opens her journal, sighs deeply and starts to write again.

126   EXT. PARK - DAY                                           126

Our young ladies and Ms. Rain are seated around a picnic

table eating, laughing, talking and writing in their journals

all at the same time. Precious has found friends.

As we watch Rhonda ...

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Some things is hard to say and

maybe not your business no way but

Rhonda's brother rape her for years

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Jermaine say mens beat her and then

As we watch Ms. Rain.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Miz Rain still a sort of mystery,

but a nice one like the sun.

As we watch the group from a distance...

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Miz Rain right too. These girls is

my family now. They visit me at

hospital when I had Abdul and even

take up a collection when Mama kick

me out. They got love in they eyes

and in they hearts for me, same as

I got for them.

127   INT. CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY                   127

Ms. Weiss speaks from behind her desk as Precious sits on the

couch beside her backpack looking bored.

MS. WEISS

...You know you can use your

notebook between sessions

Claireece.

PRECIOUS

I do.

MS. WEISS

I mean you can use it specifically

for trying to recover certain early

memories.

Precious nods mechanically.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Tired of this lady asking me

questions. Miz Rain say talk anyway

but Miz Weiss just a spy for the

State who write reports on me

undercover. Reports go in file.

File say what I could get, where I

could go and if I could get cut off

and kicked out of Advancement

House.

MS. WEISS

(beat)

What are you thinking?

PRECIOUS

Nothing.

MS. WEISS

Oh I doubt that Claireece. It seems

like you're always thinking about

something.

PRECIOUS

I don't know. It's sort of hot in

here I guess.

MS. WEISS

It is, isn't it? As a matter of

fact, I'm going to get myself

something to drink. Would you like

something to drink Claireece?

PRECIOUS

A soda sounds nice ...please.

MS. WEISS

What kind?

PRECIOUS

I don't care.

MS. WEISS

Oh c'mon, you must.

PRECIOUS

Orange.

MS. WEISS

Okee Dokee.

Ms. Weiss collects some change, grins at Precious and then

steps out of the room leaving her purse open on the desk.

MS. WEISS

Back in a jiffy.

The moment the door closes, Precious dashes across the room

for the file cabinet behind Ms. Weiss' desk.

Precious searches the drawers in the cabinet and rifles

through the files.

128   EXT. HALLWAY - DAY                                          128

Ms. Weiss inserts several pieces of change into a vending

machine and presses a button. A can of Soda CLUNKS down

through the bowels of the machine.

129   OFFICE                                                      129

Pouring through the "J" files, Precious stops at Jones and

then first goes for "P". She sees nothing, sucks her teeth,

thinks a moment and then looks for "C".

130   HALLWAY                                                     130

Ms. Weiss saunters back towards the office whistling softly

with 2 sodas in her hand.

131   OFFICE                                                      131

Precious finally finds the file with her name on it and looks

up as FOOTSTEPS sound outside the door.

Ms. Weiss steps in.

Precious is now seated on the couch again with a corner of

her file protruding from her bookbag.

Ms. Weiss hands Precious her soda.

PRECIOUS

Thank you.

MS. WEISS

You know your mother's been calling

here wanting to come visit.

PRECIOUS

Really?

MS. WEISS

Would you like her to come to a

counseling session with you?

PRECIOUS

I don't know. I never really

thought about it before.

MS. WEISS

Well that's just one more thing to

consider before I see you next

week.

Ms. Weiss smiles at Precious. Precious smiles back.

132   INT. ADVANCEMENT HOUSE: PRECIOUS' ROOM - DAY             132

Jermaine rocks Abdul's crib with one hand while looking at

the file with Precious as both girls sit cross-legged on

Precious' bed.

Precious reads carefully.

PRECIOUS

'I have just finished a session

with Claireece Precious Jones, an

eighteen-year-old African American

female. According to her teachers

at Each One Teach One where she

attends school she is a pen-, phen-

award for outstanding achievement.

She seems actively en...engaged in

scores are disappointingly low... '

Not to Miz Rain! Not to Miz Rain!

'She scored 2.8 On her last test.'

So what! Miz Rain-

JERMAINE

Get a grip and gon' read the report

say.

Precious continues.

PRECIOUS

'She will need at least an 8.0

Before she can enter G.E.D. Class

and begin work toward her high

school e-q...equivalency.'

Surprised and impressed, Jermaine double takes on Precious.

JERMAINE

...Nice.

PRECIOUS

Thanks.

'Abdul is the client's second-born

child. He's from all outwhere...

JERMAINE

PRECIOUS

'Appearances, a healthy and

Precious and Jermaine look at each other. Both are at a

loss...

PRECIOUS & JERMAINE

Whatever.

PRECIOUS

... 'and with great affection and

JERMAINE

'eagerly'

PRECIOUS

... 'seeks any and all information

Jermaine. Jermaine looks at Precious oddly.

PRECIOUS

Finish reading this ...I know

what's coming.

Jermaine pauses and then continues reading the file as

Precious rises and paces the room.

JERMAINE

'Although she is in school now, it

is not a job readiness program.

Nonetheless, Claireece is capable

of going to work. In January, her

son will be two years old. In

keeping with the new initiative on

welfare reform, I feel Claireece

would benefit from any of the

various workfare programs in

existence. Despite her obvious

intellectual limitations she is

quite capable of working as a home

attendant.'

PRECIOUS

I don't want to be no motherfucking

home attendant! I wanna be...

JERMAINE

Hush! 'My rapp-o-r-t with Precious

is minimal. Although I am not sure

with whom, she evidently has access

Each One Teach One. She has a

JERMAINE

That's the bitch's job, to get the

mofuckin' goods on you!

morning.

133   INT. ADVANCEMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY                       133

Precious hurries into a room carrying Abdul. The sign on the

door says "DAYCARE".

Precious dashes out of the room alone.

WOMAN'S (0.S.)

And don't be coming back late for

his bad ass neither.

134   EXT STREET - DAY                                           134

Precious marches to school with her bookbag and red scarf.

She clearly has a lot on her mind.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Miz Weiss just part of the gang but

definitely not cool. And social

worker look at me like I am ugly

freak who did something to make my

own life like it is. I guess I am

trying to figure out just what has

happened to me while Miz Weiss just

hell bent on making me go wipe old

people's asses.

Precious crosses the street.

share?

The only hand up belongs to Precious'.

MS. RAIN

Okay Precious.

PRECIOUS

I don't really want to read all I

wrote, I jus' wanna kinda say what

it is I'm writing about and how it

came about.

AISHA

What happened?

PRECIOUS

Well, to make a long story short,

the counselor at Advancement House

quizzing me about Mama and Daddy

etc., etc. But it's really about

workfare. She want to send me out

as home attendant.

RHONDA

How you know?

PRECIOUS

Cause I stole my file from

Advancement House and read it.

The class GASPS.

JO ANN

Next time get mine's too.

PRECIOUS

All this 'What you wanna be?' And

'You can talk to me.' They ain' no

motherfucking therapists on our

side, they just flunkies for the

Sit up straight Jermaine and watch

Jermaine reluctantly sits up.

MS. RAIN

Now I see your points, but is

stealing...

You read the whole thing by

Yeah...basically.

Rhonda used to have to go all the

way out to Brighton Beach where she

work for them people.

PRECIOUS

The people had her there all day

and night - 'on call' they call it.

But you only get pay for 8 hours so

that's 8 X $6.37

notebook)

= $50.96 a day, but then you is not

really getting that much cause you

Home attendants usually work six

days a week. I would only see Abdul

school?

Am I gonna hafta go be home

attendant like Rhonda was?

MS. RAIN

No! So stop worrying about it.

We'll cross that bridge when we get

to it. Trust me -no, trust

yourself. My concern now is that if

this Ms. Weiss is someone you're

working with and can't trust, she's

out! We gotta find somebody else.

PRECIOUS

Well, I just write in my notebook

till I get wif some kinda therapist

I can trust. Actually that always

help me more than talking to her.

Plus, I'm going to start going to

meetings wif Rita for insect

survivors.

BUNNY

Incest.

That's what I mean.

PRECIOUS

136   INT. CITY BUS - DAY                                        136

Rita looks out the window of a moving 102 bus and then steps

across the aisle and sits beside Precious who stares out the

window pensively.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Rita and me on our way. I look at

subway map sometimes and wonder

where I be if I go to the end of

the line. Jermaine say there be a

white boy wif a baseball bat when

you get off. Rita say it's not

true, or if it be true, it's only

part true.

The bus comes to a stop and the girls dash out the back door.

IRENE

Hello and welcome to our Tuesday

night beginner's meeting...My name

is Irene. I am an incest

survivor...

Precious looks utterly amazed. Her jaw drops. From here, the

women's voices are so faint that they are barely audible as

we hear Precious' thoughts.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)                             IRENE

This girl look like a movie       It started when I was about 4

star and she in here too?!        or 5 years old with him

All kinda women in here.          fondling me. By the time I

Princess girls, big girls,        was 12, he was having

old women, young women, white     intercourse with me 3 or 4

women, lotta white women.         Times a week...

A montage of other women standing and speaking follows. As

the women talk, Precious' face fills with the wonder of

seeing the world through the window of a spacecraft headed

for re-entry.

CANDACE, SIXTIES, WHITE speaks next.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)                       CANDACE

What am I hearing?! What in       ....I didn't remember what my

h

the world?! One hour and a        father did to me for so many

alf women talk. How can this     years until after he died...

happen to so many people?

CAITLIN, 20's, WHITE speaks.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)                       CAITLIN

And these is just the ones        ...I am a proud lesbian. But

that come out to the meeting.     it's the only thing I'm proud

What about the rest? Do I         of. I was confined to a

pass them in the street and       mental institution for 14

do not know?                      years....

Finally, Precious stands.

She looks around as if seeing from the top of a mountain.

Finally she clears her throat and then ...

PRECIOUS

I was raped by my father and beat

by my mother ever since I could

remember anything at all. Raped and

beat by both.

The worst part about it...the part

even worse than them doin' it...was

how shamed I felt during the times

when my father was raping me and it

felt ...good. Anyway, I see a girl

and always think I know how easy or

bad she have it just by lookin'.

Now I wonder if everybody go

through sumthin' -sumthin' that

Never said alla that before...

Precious looks around the room to find herself surrounded by

understanding eyes.

PRECIOUS

Anyway, thas all I'd like to say

for today. Thank y'all for letting

me share...

Irene nods and Precious sits. Rita squeezes her hand. Another

woman stands up to recount her story. Precious looks aglow.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Everything is floating around me

now. Like geeses from the lake. I

see flying. Feel flying. Am flying.

Far up...Thank you Rita for getting

me here on time.

140   INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE MEETING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER     140

The group slowly emerges. A table with a nice arrangement of

cookies stands next to a coffee maker and soda machine.

Irene chats with Candace over a cup of coffee. Precious and

Rita talk with TWO OTHER YOUNG WOMEN, MIRIAM, BLACK 20's LONG

PRETTY DREADLOCKS and LISA, WHITE 20's.

PRECIOUS

...How you get your hair like that?

MIRIAM

Oh, you like it? I do yours one day

Do you want another hot chocolate?

Precious smiles and shakes her head no. Rita gets up.

Precious watches her go as Miriam and Lisa chat.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Rita ask me do I want another hot

chocolate. I do but I don't want to

winning. I'm drinking hot chocolate

on the Upper West Side with girls -

all kind who love me. How does a

stranger meet me and love me?

Rita returns with two cups of hot chocolate.       She gives one

to Precious.

Precious thanks Rita with her eyes.

FADE OUT

FADE IN

R141   EXT. MRS. WEISS'S WAITING AREA - DAY                         R141

Precious, wearing her new scarf and glasses, sits in the

waiting room holding a book in her hands. Abdul plays among

the little children in the kids area behind her. Crumpled

wrapping paper lays beside her. The book's first page reads:

CONGRATULATIONS PRECIOUS! I'M SO PROUD OF YOU YET AGAIN.

LOVE, MS. RAIN

Sheila and Ruby walk in and sit down beside Precious. Ruby

has a black eye. They sit in silence for a few moments,

waiting for their turn.

SECRETARY

(O.S.)

Sheila Hewitt, Ms. Rubenstein is

ready for you.

(CONTINUED)

107A.

R141   CONTINUED:                                              R141

SHEILA

(To Ruby)

Go on back there!

RUBY

But there are no kids there I can

play with.

SHEILA

Do you want me to knock your other

eye out! Just sit there and shut

up then! I'm going to talk to this

lady before my shit gets cut off!

Sheila heads up the stairs toward the offices. Precious

closes her book. Its cover reads: Chrystal Stair: Selected

Works by Langston Hughes.

SECRETARY

(O.S.)

Clareece Precious Jones!   Mrs.

Weiss is ready for you.

Precious stands up and looks down at Ruby, sulking in her

chair. She leans down, gives her a big hug and tenderly

fixes Ruby's hair.

Precious walks off toward the stairs, but stops when she

passes a mirror hanging on the wall. Within the reflection,

she sees her true self for the first time.

(CONTINUED)

108.

R141   CONTINUED: (2)                                        R141

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

One day Miz Rain ask us to write

about our ideal self...I wrote that

I would be light skinned and small

wif wavy swing-job hair.

She heads up the stairs toward the offices.

PRECIOUS (V.O.)

(beat)

Miz Rain read all that and then say

I am beautiful like I am. I never

believe her before but somehow,

today, this moment -can't say why,

I do. Just now...The inside I

thought was so beautiful is a black

girl too.

(CONTINUED)

109.

R141   CONTINUED: (3)                                          R141

Precious turns around to find that Ruby has grabbed her arm.

She then reaches up and hugs Precious tightly.

Through the embrace, Precious finds herself facing the many

mirrors on display by the old man on the folding chair. In

her reflections, she sees the skinny white girl who she has

frequently imagined herself as gradually transform into the

real Precious one by one.

142    EXT. STREET - DAY                                        142

We tilt down upon a stately pre-war building bathed in stark

wintry light.

MS. WEISS (O.S.)

Perhaps we should begin by talking

a little bit about the abuse.

143    INT. CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY                   143

Mary looks worse than ever. Her hair and clothing are

disastrous. She rocks somewhat anxiously on the edge of her

seat like a desperate salesman looking to close a deal.

MARY

'Buse?

MS. WEISS

Yes Ms. Johnston. Abuse.

MARY

There was no drugs in ma house! No

drugs! 'Cause Precious know damn

well I whoop her ass bright blue if

she bring some drugs in ma...

MS. WEISS

I'm referring to inappropriate acts

of a physical and sexual nature

involving Precious.

MARY

Why'nt you say dat? Dat?! Okay.

MS. WEISS

Yes. According to Precious' files

she has had two children by your

boyfriend, the late Carl Kenwood

Jones, who is also her father?

(CONTINUED)

110.

143   CONTINUED:                                               143

You've been calling here saying you

want to be reunited with your

daughter and grandson and that you

want them to come home. Well I

think you'd better explain just

what happened in that home.

Precious waits nervously.

MARY

...Well, I, Precious b'long at home

cause I'm a good mother. She had

everything. I done tole her that.

Pink 'n white baby carriage, little

pink bootie socks, dresses;

everything I put on her pink.

Precious, she so smiling and

healthy. A day don't go by I don't

throw her wheeling in the air. I

take her up and down 125th Street.

Me 'n Carl loved Precious. I

dreamed of the day we was gonna you

know, git married, git house wif

grass, color TV's in all the rooms.

Precious, She born about the same

time as Miz West son that got kilt.

You remember him don't you

Precious?

Precious looks at a loss.

MARY

PRECIOUS

I was born in November...far as I

know.

MARY

Yeah yeah thas right. My little

Scorpio chile! Scorpio's crafty. I

ain' sayin' they lie, jus' you

Precious looks embarrassed beyond embarrassment.

MS. WEISS

Ms. Johnston, when did the abuse

happen, how often, where? And, when

were you first aware of what was

going on?

(CONTINUED)

111.

143   CONTINUED: (2)                                           143

MARY

When? I don't know when it start.

When I remember it? She still

little. Yeah, around three maybe. I

give her a bottle. I still got milk

in my bresses but not from her but

from Carl sucking. I give him

MS. WEISS

Excuse me?

MARY

MS. WEISS

MARY

that shit happen to Precious on me.

I love Carl, I loved him. He her

Mary can't help but to shoot a look of anger at Precious

while Ms. Weiss pauses to regain her composure...

LONG DISSOLVE TO:

112.

144   INT. CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY                      144

Precious nods reluctantly.

MARY

Lady from Each One Preach One

say she got poems too. In fact...

PRECIOUS

That's enough Mama. That's ...

enough.

(beat)

You know, I didn't realize what you

was until this day -even after all

those thangs you did. Maybe I

didn't know no better or maybe I

just didn't want to but I finally

see you crystal clear for the first

time.

(beat)

I forgive you too.

Mary smiles warmly and nods confidently to Ms. Weiss.

PRECIOUS

...but I'll never see you again.

Not even if you dead.

Mary's expression drops. Precious turns to Ms. Weiss as Mary

starts to spring up from her seat.

PRECIOUS

(without looking at her)

Stay down Mama.

Mary sits obediently. Precious turns to Ms. Weiss.

PRECIOUS

I forgive you too. I can tell right

now that you ain't qualified for

dis kind of mess.

Precious thinks a moment and grins a grin that seems much

older.

MS. WEISS

...Precious? I was thinking we

might...

PRECIOUS

I took the TABE test again. This

time it's 7.8. Last time it was

2.8.

(CONTINUED)

113.

144   CONTINUED:                                                    144

According to the test, I'm reading

around 7th or 8th grade level now.

High school level next. College

after that.

MS. WEISS

...Why congratulations Precious.

That's ...

Precious stands abruptly, startling both women. She takes a

step towards her mother. Mary winces. Ms. Weiss looks

concerned.

MS. WEISS

Precious, perhaps it's best if you

remain seat...

Precious leans and kisses Mary tenderly on the cheek, turns

and gently touches Ms. Weiss' shoulder.

Precious takes a good look at them both, smiles and leaves

the room.

MS. WEISS (O.S.)

Precious?!

145   INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                                    145

Ms. Weiss calls after her. Precious keeps walking.

MS. WEISS (O.S.)

Precious!

Precious doesn't stop.

146   INT. CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                 146

The women run to the window.

They see Precious burst out onto the street.

147   EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS                                      147

Precious walks down the crowded street carrying Mongo and

Andre. She is happy and filled with hope. Tom Cruise is there

chatting up another young girl... she pays him no mind.

DISSOLVE TO:

148   DEDICATION                                                    148
