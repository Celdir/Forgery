October 1987

CRAIS

That was the scene in California's

Mojave Desert three years ago today

-- the historic first view of the

Newcomer ship upon its dramatic

arrival.  As with the assassination

of John Kennedy, who among us does

not remember exactly where he was

that October nineteenth morning,

when news first broke: that people

have landed... from another star.

FEDORCHUK

I remember where I was -- pissing

off my balcony at the neighbor's

dog!

ALTEREZ

(yells at Crais on TV)

Get to the goddamn ball scores!

CAL-TECH PROFESSOR

From the time mankind first gazed up

at the stars there had been

speculation about a visit by people

from "out there."  How ironic that

when that first contact was made,

the two hundred and sixty thousand

occupants aboard the craft were as

surprised as we were about their

arrival.  That they awakened from

frozen hibernation to find their

malfunctioning autopilot had landed

them here by mistake.

CRAIS

These "Newcomers," we soon learned,

were a genetically-engineered race,

adapted for hard labor in almost any

environmental condition.  In effect,

their ship was a slave ship...

washed ashore on Earth with no way

to get back to where they came

from...

FRESNO HOUSEWIFE

When the Newcomers were first let

out of the ship, they were

quarantined in a camp not ten miles

from the town here.  You can imagine

how the people around here felt

about that.  But once they were

releases from the camp and we got a

chance to know them, we saw what

nice, quiet people they really are...

FEDORCHUK

Hey, Henry, how you doin' tonight?

Workin' hard?

FEDORCHUK

You got your green card, buddy?  You

didn't leave home without it?

CUT TO:

SYKES

Jeez... they call that gang-bang a

game...?

SYKES

Take a hike.

SYKES

Why's it have to be sour milk that

these guys get wasted on?  What the

hell's wrong with Jack Daniels, or

Thunderbird for chrissakes?

(beat; disgusted)

Slagtown.  Shit...

SYKES

Hope their plumbing's the same.

TUGGLE

It is.

(and Sykes gives him

a look)

TUGGLE (O.S.)

So you gonna go, or you not gonna

go?

SYKES

How can I go?

TUGGLE

Put on your wash-and-wear suit and

your clip-on tie, have your landlady

tie your shoes for you, and show up

at the church.  Simple.

(beat)

Me and Carol are going.

SYKES

What?

TUGGLE

Hey, look -- we've known Kristin

since... since she was conceived in

that cabin up in Big Bear.

Remember?  You and Edie banged the

wall so hard, me and Carol were

picking plaster out of our hair for

a week...

SYKES

Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see

Kristin get married, okay?  But--

TUGGLE

But you're bummed because your ex

and her new husband are paying for

the whole thing.

SYKES

Shit, if Kristin had to get married

where I could afford it, we'd be

holding the reception at Buddy's

Burgers.

SYKES

Uh-oh... Check it out.

SYKES

Does that look at all suspicious to

you?

TUGGLE

Whatever gave you that idea?

TUGGLE

This is one-Henry-seven, we've got a

possible two-eleven in progress at

Porter's Mini-Mart, corner of Court

and Alvarado.  Requesting backup.

SYKES

Let's do it, partner.

SYKES

You got your vest?

TUGGLE

Of course.  Right in the trunk of

the car.

SYKES

Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.

TUGGLE

Watch the driver.  I'm going for a

better angle on the door.

SYKES

I got him.  Don't get pinned.

SYKES

(under his breath)

Aw, shit.

SYKES

Get outta there!

TUGGLE

I can't!  Do you mind!

SYKES

I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!

OLD MAN

Can I get out now?

TUGGLE

Move it!

SYKES

Aw shit, Tug, Jesus!  Goddamn it!

HUMAN COP

Whoa, whoa... hold it.  Take it easy.

(to alien on the

ground)

You okay?

JETSON

I am all right.

HUMAN COP

I better call in.

JETSON

Your hand will require attention.

SYKES

Get the hell away from me!  I don't

need your goddamn help.

NATUZZI

Looks like a standard combat pump-

action.

MINKLER

It is.

NATUZZI

So what punched holes clear through

that car out there?

MINKLER

BRI Sabot slugs.  These puppies are

nasty.  Two plastic sabots fall away

in flight leaving a fifty-caliber

slug going two thousand feet per

second.  Tug might as well've been

hiding behind a rosebush.

NATUZZI

Pretty heavy artillery for knocking

over a liquor store.

JETSON (O.S.)

An identical round was used in the

shooting of a Newcomer named

Hubley, two days ago.

MINKLER

Yeah?  So why the extra fire power?

JETSON

Perhaps because even the larger

caliber handguns aren't always

effective against my people.

SYKES

(mulls this, then)

You saying there's some connection

to this other homicide?

FEMALE COP

Hey, give me a hand with this woman,

will ya Jetson?  We've got to get

her to Division for her statement

and she won't budge.

JETSON

(to Sykes)

Excuse me.

SYKES

So, you think there's a connection,

or what?  Hey!

CUT TO:

KRISTIN'S VOICE

(bouncy, bride-to-be

happy)

Hi, Daddy, it's me.  I'm over at

Danny's parents' house... talking

about Sunday.  I thought maybe you'd

be home by now.  Anyway, uh, nothing

really.  I just wanted to call and

say I love you.  I love you, Daddy.

(she giggles)

Uh-oh, I shouldn't'a done that.

Knowing you, you'll probably pull

this tape out of your machine and

save it -- in that drawer where you

keep every card I ever gave you, and

all of my old baby teeth... gross!

Anyway, Daddy, don't save this tape

-- but I do love you, and I'll talk

to you before Sunday.

(beat)

Oh, Tug and Carol came by and met

Danny last week.

(Sykes stiffens)

Danny thought Tug was the greatest

-- but, then, who doesn't?  Anyway,

love you, talk to you soon.  'Bye.

FADE TO:

SYKES

So what've you got on Tuggle's

killers?

FEDORCHUK

Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than

ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on

it, okay?

SYKES

You don't have squat.

FEDORCHUK

You ever try to make a case in

Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer

informants is about as long as the

list of Mexican war heroes...

ALTEREZ

Up yours.

FEDORCHUK

... Nobody talks to nobody down

there.  Half of them don't speak

English and the other half only when

it suits them.  It's gonna take some

time.

SYKES

Yeah, I know it's gonna take time.

Like until the Ice Capades opens in

Hell, with you two on it.

WARNER

Nobody wanders off!  I got an

announcement.  Get your asses back

in here.

WARNER

I'll make this short.  This is a

directive from Chief Evaner, who is

acting on orders from the Mayor, who

is under mandate from the Federal

Bureau of Newcomer Relations.  As of

nine o'clock this morning, one

Newcomer uniform officer has been

promoted to the rank of Detective,

third grade.

WARNER

And we've got him, gentleman.

(more groans)

Volunteers for duty with the new

detective should see me in my

office... otherwise I will choose a

volunteer myself.  That is all.

FEDORCHUK

Unbelievable bullshit.

ALTEREZ

How long has this Slag been on the

force?  A year, max -- right?

DETECTIVE

I don't know about the rest of you,

but I sure as hell ain't gonna sit

still for this.  I'm calling the

union, pronto.

FEDORCHUK

Where the hell is he going?

WARNER

Yeah, Sykes?

SYKES

Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for

duty with the new detective.

WARNER

... All right.  Detective Sergeant

Sykes, this is Detective... Jetson.

JETSON

We have met.

GOLDRUP

Victor Goldrup, Mayor's office.

Congratulations, gentlemen.

WARNER

(to Sykes)

You are to have nothing to do with

the investigation into Bill Tuggle's

death.  You know that.  Leave that

for Fedorchuk.

SYKES

(nodding)

Departmental policy.

WARNER

(to Jetson)

You?

JETSON

Yes, sir.

WARNER

Good.

SYKES

There's another case I'd like to

take.  A homicide -- a Newcomer

named Hubley.

WARNER

Granger and Pitts are already on it.

SYKES

Granger and Pitts have one hell of a

caseload... and I would have thought

with Jetson here being the first

Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's

body being found over in the

Newcomer community...

WARNER

Don't tell me what to think.

GOLDRUP

He's got a point.  That's the sort

of thing we should be doing with

this early advancement program...

CUT TO:

SYKES

... and we work my hours.  I'll do

the driving, you do the paperwork.

You gotta learn it so you might as

well do it all.

JETSON

(after a moment)

Sergeant... I'd like to thank you

for what you're doing.

SYKES

What's that?

(then realizing)

Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in

your head.  We're not pals, we're

not married, and we ain't gonna take

long moonlight walks together...

We're just partners.  And don't call

me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or

Matt if you have to.

JETSON

I am George.

SYKES

Wait a minute.  George?  George

Jetson?

SYKES

(between laughs)

Man, somebody really hung one on

you!  I've heard some good ones for

you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley

Davidson.  I guess the people at

immigration got a little punchy

after a while, coming up with names

for a quarter of a million of you.

You weren't at the back of the line,

were you, George?

JETSON

My true name is Ss'tangya

T'ssorentsa'.

SYKES

Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I

stick to George, do you?

SYKES

Anyway, what's it matter to you if

we think it's funny, right?  Whatta

you care?

JETSON

That is exactly so.

(completely deadpan)

It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm

sure it doesn't bother you at all

that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss",

two words in my language which mean

"excrement" and "cranium".

JETSON

"Shit... head".

CUT TO:

SYKES

Let's talk Hubley.

JETSON

(refers to a folder

he holds)

His body was discovered three days

ago, in an alley off of Central

Avenue, near downtown.

SYKES

With two BRI Sabot slugs in the

chest.

JETSON

(gently correcting

him)

Through the chest.  Rupturing both

the primary and secondary hearts.

SYKES

(out the window)

Nice signal, dickwad!

JETSON

He was employed at the Northwest

Petroleum Refinery in Torrance.  He

was manager of the Methane Facility.

He was also a principle partner in a

real estate venture to develop low-

cost housing for Newcomers.

SYKES

Terrific.  A real pillar of the

community.

(beat)

Was Hubley missing anything when

they found him?  Was he ripped off?

JETSON

(checks file)

There was no wallet... but he was

still wearing a watch and two rings.

SYKES

The guys at the mini-mart last night

made a half-assed stab at the money

in the till -- but I don't think

that's what they were there for.  I

think we got us a couple'a

executions on our hands, George...

JETSON

The murder at the mini-mart is not

our case.  The Captain said--

SYKES

Look, you want to fit in here,

right?  You want to learn how to get

along?

JETSON

Yes.

SYKES

Well, there's a thing about

partners, about being somebody's

partner.  You do for each other.

And other people's rules don't mean

shit.  It's the rules set up between

the two of you, that's all that

counts.  Understand?

(Jetson nods)

Okay.  Well, my friend and partner

was shot last night and I'm after

the shitbag that did it.  As my

partner, I'm asking you to respect

me and help me find him.

JETSON

And as my partner, I ask you to

respect me and my desire not to

break with procedure.

JETSON

What is wrong?

SYKES

(very calm)

Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get

something straight.  You agree that

there's a good chance these two

shootings are somehow related,

right?

JETSON

Well... yes, quite possibly.

SYKES

Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be

willing to accept the theory,

George, that... possibly... by

examining the evidence from one case

we might shed some small ray of

light on the other?  Does that sound

unreasonable to you?

JETSON

Yes... no, it is not unreasonable.

Although I--

SYKES

Great.

(a relieved sigh)

Well, I'm sure glad that's settled,

aren't you?

SYKES

I think we're really starting to

click now, George -- hmmm?

CUT TO:

WINTER

You know I've been over all this

with Fedorchuk and Alterez this

morning...

SYKES

Come on.  You got nothin' better to

do, cushy county job like yours.

WINTER

Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck.

Anyway, according to the sheet, the

guy you nailed outside by the car--

SYKES

The human?

WINTER

Yeah... he was one Martin Helder.

White male, twenty-seven.  Let's

see... wrap sheet shows one armed

robbery conviction, a couple for

sale of a controlled substance.

Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke

when you stopped his clock.

JETSON

Have you identified this one?

WINTER

So far he's a John Doe.  Or a Sam

Slag, if you like.

WINTER

No I.D. on him and -- well, you

know, no fingerprints -- so it could

be tough.  Your buddies this morning

went through the mug book but

couldn't make a facial match.

SYKES

Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with

his hands in his back pockets.

WINTER

(referring to

Raincoat alien)

You took this gut out, too, didn't

you?

SYKES

Yeah.

WINTER

Lucky for you, you got him in both

of his... well, what we loosely

refer to as... hearts.

SYKES

Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my

damn gun into him.

WINTER

That's the way these people are.

You don't hit both pumps you just

piss them off.

WINTER

Oh, here's an extra headshot if you

need one.

(hands Sykes a

polariod of dead

alien's face)

We're just about to start cutting

in.  You're welcome to stick around

if you want.  It's really

fascinating stuff.

SYKES

Yeah, I'll bet.

SYKES

What's this?  What's going on?

JETSON

Nothing.

SYKES

(really suspicious

now)

Nothing?

JETSON

(looking away)

Shouldn't we examine their personal

effects?

CUT TO:

JETSON

What is this?

SYKES

(looks, then)

A rubber.  A condom.  You know...

Coney Island whitefish?

(Jetson doesn't know

what one is)

Men, human men, put them on their,

uh -- penises -- to protect against

having babies.

(Jetson still doesn't

get it; Sykes turns

to Ortiz)

You need this for anything?

ORTIZ

Nope, got my own.  Anything you guys

don't use gets stuffed away in

storage.

SYKES

Get the picture?

JETSON

(frowning)

And that fits?

SYKES

Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It

stretches.

JETSON

And still it fits?

SYKES

What is this stuff?

JETSON

It is a resin.

JETSON

(continuing)

Newcomers working near methane

gasses at oil refineries must paint

it on their boots to protect against

sparks.

SYKES

How the hell do you know that?

JETSON

A large number of my people were

hired by refineries because the

methane fumes are not harmful to us.

My spouse's brother is one.

SYKES

So the Slag they're cutting into

upstairs worked at a refinery just

like Hubley worked at a refinery.

(beat)

I'd say that "possible" connection

between the two cases just got a

hell of a lot more possible.

(beat)

Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk

to the wife of the Slag store owner

blown away last night.

JETSON

I believe I should interview the

widow alone.

SYKES

Why the hell--?!

(realizes it's

because of his lack

of "bedside manner")

Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

O'NEAL

(yelling over the

roar)

Mr. Hubley was an all right guy --

and a damn good manager.  The men

liked him.  I'm really gonna have to

scramble to fill his shoes.

SYKES

Well, one of the men didn't like him

so much...

O'NEAL

(looking at photo)

You think this is the guy who did

it?

SYKES

We think he could'a been involved,

yeah.  You know him?

O'NEAL

To be honest, it's hard to say.  I

hate to admit it but -- they all

still kinda look alike to me.

SYKES

(impatient)

Who else can I ask around here?

O'NEAL

(looking at photo

again)

Wait.  You know who it looks like?

Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James

Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He

took the afternoon off.

SYKES

I think you're gonna find he's taken

the rest of his life off.

SYKES

That where Anderson worked?

O'NEAL

Yes it is.

(some alien workers

come through the

door)

Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas

in there.  I don't know how these

fellas do it.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SYKES

Jesus.  Welcome back Ozzie and

Harriet...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JETSON

Mrs. Porter is not taking her

husband's death well.

SYKES

(impatient)

Did you learn anything?

JETSON

A week ago two men came to see her

husband.  After they left, he was

very frightened.  She identified one

of the men from a photo I showed

her.  It was Hubley.

SYKES

Aw-right.  What about the other guy?

JETSON

She didn't know him.  But she said

her son might.

SYKES

Did you talk to him?

JETSON

He has not been home since that day.

But she told me where to find him.

CUT TO:

MAYOR

... Our guest speaker tonight has

done so much in his community and

for his community in such a short

period of time.  And I must say, as

the founder of the first Newcomer

owned and operated corporation in

Southern California, he certainly

has come quite far in the last few

years.  Granted, not as far as he

came in the years before reaching

Los Angeles.

MAYOR

(continuing)

As Mayor of this city, it gives me

great pleasure to introduce someone

who has so readily made our city

his home... and all of us who live

here, his friends.  Ladies and

gentlemen, William Harcourt.

HARCOURT

Thank you all for that very warm

reception.

(pauses, smiles)

I'm particularly grateful because I

actually had the gall to write that

in my notes: "Thank you all for that

very warm reception".  Imagine how

embarrassed I would've been if it

hadn't have been such a warm

reception.

CUT TO:

SYKES

William Harcourt?

HARCOURT

Yes...

SYKES

I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is

Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police

Department.

HARCOURT

(nodding greeting)

Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't

aware there were any Newcomers at

the rank of Detective yet.

JETSON

I am the first.

HARCOURT

Congratulations.  This is my

administrative assistant, Rudyard

Kipling.

SYKES

(throw away)

Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?

(to Harcourt)

Listen, we just need a minute of

your time...

JETSON

We'd like to ask you about a

business associate of your, Warren

Hubley.

HARCOURT

Yes, I heard about poor Warren.

Tragic.

SYKES

You were partners with him on some

Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate

thing.

HARCOURT

That's right.  He and I, along with

seven or eight others.  Listen,

gentlemen, I will be happy to assist

you in any way I can --

unfortunately, at the moment, I'm

overdue at another function.

MAYOR (O.S.)

William...

HARCOURT

Mr. Mayor...

MAYOR

William, I was wondering if you

wouldn't rather ride with Luisa and

me.  Two limousines trying to make

it across town in all this traffic,

we're bound to be later than we

already are.

HARCOURT

Excellent idea.  Ray, I wonder if

you know two of your police

officers... Detective Jetson and

Sykes.

MAYOR

(shaking their hands,

dismissively)

A pleasure.

(to Harcourt)

We really should be going.

HARCOURT

(continuing)

Please feel free to call my office

Monday morning for an appointment.

(to Jetson)

Congratulations again on your

promotion, Detective.  Remember...

you're out there setting an example

in our community.  I'll be keeping

an eye on you.

CUT TO:

KIPLING

That cop, the human, he was the one

who killed Anderson and the driver.

HARCOURT

This is becoming a serious breach of

security.

KIPLING

He didn't recognize me.

HARCOURT

It is his new partner that I'm

worried about.

CUT TO:

SYKES

Go on ahead.  I'll be right in.

(to Maffet, low)

What'd you dig up for me?

MAFFET

You said you wanted the biggest

thing I could find... Well, this is

it.

SYKES

What is it?

MAFFET

Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking

twice the impact energy of .44

Magnum hot loads.

SYKES

(flips open cylinder)

Only holds five.

MAFFET

Yeah, the shells are too big for six

in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you

don't need but one.

SYKES

(sighting)

No... two.

SYKES

Well, let's see what you got,

Cochise.  Gimme six, rapid fire.

SYKES

(continuing)

How long you been shooting?  That's

pitiful.  Whattya gonna do if

somebody draws down on you, wave

your scores on the written exam at

'em?

JETSON

Why did you do it?

SYKES

Why'd I do what?

JETSON

Agree to work with me?  You don't

like me... you don't like any of us.

You have nothing but contempt for

us.  And yet you become an outcast

from your club of detectives by

making me your partner...

SYKES

My partner is dead!  Because one of

you bastards killed him -- then

disappeared into a rathole down in

Slagtown, where he's home and dry,

'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody

says nothing...

SYKES

(continuing)

But he didn't figure on you, George.

You're going to get me through that

wall of silence.  You're going to

make them talk to me.  You're going

to help me find that Slag son-of-a-

bitch.  Comprendo?  And if Fedorchuk

and the boys in the bullpen don't

like it, screw them... and if the

Captain doesn't like it, screw

him... and if all the Slags down in

Slagtown don't like it... well screw

them too!

CUT TO:

SYKES

(to Jetson)

Okay, just stay back and do what I

do.  Watch and learn, watch and

learn...

SYKES

I can't see dick in here.

SYKES

(calling into the

dark silence)

Which one'a you Slags is Porter?

VOICE

(from the back of

the bar)

Who wants to know?

SYKES

(aside to Jetson)

Who said that?

JETSON

(tilts his head to

indicate)

At the end of the bar.

SYKES

My name is Sykes.  I'm--

ALIEN VOICE

Ss'ai k'ss?

OFFENDER

(merely a voice in

the dark)

Careful, ss'loka', you might hurt

yourself.

SYKES

You Porter?

JETSON

No, Matthew.  I believe this is the

one you want.

SYKES

Your name wouldn't happen to be

Porter, would it?

JETSON

Uh, Matthew...

SYKES

(over his shoulder

to Jetson)

Back off, George.

JETSON

But I-- (know this man).

SYKES

I'll handle it.

SYKES

(to Porter)

Jesus, are the questions too tough

for you already?  Let's try again--

(slowly)

Is your name Porter?

PORTER

Ss'kya'ta'.

SYKES

(to Jetson)

What's that?

JETSON

Screw you.

SYKES

(back to Porter)

Screw me?  That can't be right.

PORTER

Ss'kya ta' ss'loka'.  Ss'trokya'

ss'lato na'!

JETSON

(to Sykes, low)

You don't want to know.

SYKES

Tell me.

JETSON

Your mother mates out of season.

SYKES

(to Porter)

That's very colorful.  But see --

now I've got a problem.  I don't

seem to be getting much cooperation

from you, Porter.  So I guess we're

gonna have to take this little

session down to my office, ya

know?

JETSON

Matthew, you don't have to-- (do this).

SYKES

Stay back!  I'm okay.

PORTER

Don't they teach you anything about

us in cop school, little ss'loka'?

JETSON

Enough.

PORTER

(eyeing Jetson)

Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.  You're a

cop.

(with some contempt)

It fits you.

SYKES

You know that guy?

JETSON

(nods)

From quarantine, when my people

first arrived here.  He and I were

housed together.

SYKES

How could a straight-arrow like you

ever pick a roommate like him?

JETSON

In the camps, we were lodged four to

a room.  The selection process was

entirely random.  We did not get to

stay with our friends... or

families...

CUT TO:

JETSON

You don't know what your father and

these two men were arguing about?

PORTER

I told you -- I was in the back of

the store.  I just heard voices,

muffled like.

SYKES

One of the two men was Hubley,

right?  What about the other one?

Did you know him?

PORTER

Yeah... I seen him around.  High-

roller dude named Strader.  Joshua

Strader.  Runs a club on the west

side.  Encounters.

SYKES

Yeah, I heard of it.

PORTER

That's all I know.  You want

anything more, you ask somebody

else.

JETSON

I am sorry about your father.

JETSON

If I may make a suggestion... We

have different weak spots than you

do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve

plexus under the arm, here, will

produce the effect I think you were

looking for.

SYKES

Yeah, sure.  I knew that...

CUT TO:

KID

(serving them)

Six forty-two.

SYKES

I don't think I could ever learn to

read that shit.

(beat)

How long did it take you to learn

English?

JETSON

Three months.

(off Sykes' look)

We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is

our strength... what we were bred

for, to adapt to hostile

environments.

JETSON

(continuing)

Thank you.

SYKES

My neighbor's kid has a Newcomer

girl in his class.  She's six years

old and in seventh grade already...

SYKES

Oh, God.  I think I got yours

here...

SYKES

(continuing)

Which one is that?  Raw what?

JETSON

(eating a strip)

This is mole.  It's good.

SYKES

I'll bet.

(winces, watching him

chew)

Would it really put you out if they

tossed that on the grill for a

minute or two?

JETSON

Our bodies do not assimilate the

nutrients if the food has been

cooked.

SYKES

Oh, that's real attractive.  You got

fur in your teeth, George.  Come on,

man, we're gonna be talking to

people... jeez.

SYKES

So what was that other word for

Human... Slow ka?

JETSON

Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small

but intelligent creature".

(Sykes looks over,

doesn't know if he

likes this)

It loses much in the translation.

SYKES

And what was that one about my

mother?  That was a good one.

JETSON

Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.

SYKES

Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.

JETSON

You are Cassandra?

CASSANDRA

That's right.

JETSON

We are with the Police Department.

This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--

CASSANDRA

(laughing)

Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.

SYKES

We're looking for your boss --

Strader.

CASSANDRA

He's not here.  Why ask me?

JETSON

The young woman at the front said

you might know where he is.

CASSANDRA

She did, did she?  Well, she was

wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.

SYKES

No problem.

SYKES

Look, we're not here doing an

interview for the school paper.

This is a homicide investigation...

and if you don't stop jerkin' us

around, I'm ready to start playin'

hardball.

CASSANDRA

(slipping out of her

dance costume)

Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds

interesting.  Are you going to

strike me?  You could tie me up and

then do whatever you want with me...

I've got my own ropes.

SYKES

(still miming to

Jetson)

Does that cost extra or you throw

them in?

CASSANDRA

You've got me all wrong.  I don't

charge money for something that I

myself find pleasurable...

JETSON

I am going out to the car.  I will

meet you there.

CASSANDRA

Look, I don't know where Mr.

Strader might be.  He comes and he

goes.

SYKES

(starting to feel a

little uncomfortable)

The girl out front mentioned

Strader's assistant, somebody named

Watson.  Maybe he knows.

CASSANDRA

(tensing slightly)

Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.

CASSANDRA

(continuing)

I know... Why don't you hang around

for a while, let me entertain you?

It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the

truth, have you ever... made it...

with one of us?

SYKES

Not unless I got real drunk and

nobody told me about it later.

CASSANDRA

A virgin.  I find that very

arousing...

SYKES

There's lots of things I haven't

done, but his ain't high on the

list.  Don't take it personally.

CASSANDRA

I think you're just a little scared

now, about what you might find once

the lights go out.  A little

scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe

more than you want to admit.  But

doesn't that turn you on, that

curiosity and fear, swirling

together?

(coos)

Think of it as broadening your

horizons.

SYKES

I like my horizons narrow.

CASSANDRA

(pressing herself

into him)

Your voice is saying no, but your

body is saying yes.

SYKES

My voice, body, and everything else

is saying I'll be back in two hours

for Strader, and he better damn well

be here.

WATSON (O.S.)

(tentatively)

Yes...?

CASSANDRA (O.S.)

(over the intercom,

breathless)

Todd, it's me.  The police were just

here... looking for Strader.  And

asking about you.

SYKES

Freeze!  Now!

SYKES

(struggling with

Cassandra)

Fire escape!  End of the hall!

SYKES

(breathing hard)

I'll be damned.  It worked.

(sees Jetson run up)

How'd you like that, huh?  Whammo!

Both barrels.  Dropped him like a

bag of cement.

SYKES

Who is he?

JETSON

Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.

WATSON

I don't believe this.  Look at my

suit.  Look at what you made me do

to my car.

SYKES

(laughing)

Your girlfriend put up a better

fight than you did, pal.

JETSON

We are looking for your employer,

Joshua Strader.

WATSON

He's out of town.

JETSON

Why did you run?

WATSON

Because you two were chasing me.

SYKES

We were chasing you because you ran,

you dumb son-of-a-bitch.

JETSON

When will Strader return?

WATSON

Who knows.  He's the boss -- he

doesn't have to check in with me.

SYKES

(wearily)

Watson... this is my partner here's

first coupla days, and he wants to

make a good impression.  Me, though,

the way I feel -- this could be my

last day, know what I mean?  And I'm

ready to rain on you like a cow

pissin' on a flat rock.

WATSON

Look -- Mr. Strader hasn't been

around for a coupla days.  He didn't

tell me where he was going or when

he'd be back.  I swear it.

SYKES

(to Jetson)

What do you think?

JETSON

I believe he is probably lying.

SYKES

Through his ass.

(to Watson)

Next time you see him, tell him to

call me... unless you want us to

keep coming back on you like a bad

case of herpes.

SYKES

George, you can handle the women

from now on, you mind?

CUT TO:

QUINT

(to other Thugs)

Okay, scrape him up.

CUT TO:

HARCOURT

Any progress?

QUINT

My arm's gettin' tired and so far,

zip.

KIPLING

He is ss'verdlatya ss'alo to

Strader.

QUINT

What's that mean?

KIPLING

Duty-bonded.  His allegiance to

Strader is above pain or life.

QUINT

You tellin' me this guy would die

before he'd screw his boss and work

for us?  Nobody's that dumb.

KIPLING

It is something you couldn't

comprehend, Quint.

HARCOURT

I understand you have been resisting

my offer Mr. Watson.  Your sense of

duty to Mr. Strader is noble, but --

no longer an issue, I'm afraid...

HARCOURT

(continuing)

I will not make this offer again.  I

want you to work for me, to manage

the nightclub as Strader's successor.

If you do, you will know a wealth

and comfort our people never dared

imagine...

WATSON

Sss'k'a ta'!

HARCOURT

It is such a pity to die for an

outmoded value.

(rising)

Mr. Quint, I believe it's time for

our friend's swimming lesson.

HARCOURT

(to Watson)

It's important to learn new skills.

Essential to your growth as a

person.

QUINT

You never seen this before, have

you, Billy?  oh, man, you ain't

gonna believe it... seawater is like

battery acid to these guys... I

don't know what it is, some kinds

chemical reaction.  Whatta you think

it is, Watson?  Whoa, hold him.

(a wave breaks

outside, the foam

rolls in)

What I love about the surf is you

can never tell how far up it's going

to come until it... whoops, got a

little wet there.

QUINT

Last call, sucker.  One... two...

THREE!

KIPLING

When we picked him up, he was

talking to those two cops -- the two

who came to question you about

Hubley.

HARCOURT

This is getting out of hand.  I want

you to deal with it.  Immediately.

HARCOURT

(continuing)

We must learn to embrace the things

we fear... and from that grow

strong.

CUT TO:

JETSON

(holds up milk

carton)

Would you mind?

SYKES

(indicates phone)

So, she keeps you on a pretty short

leash, does she?

JETSON

My wife?  She worries about me.

SYKES

Yeah... I know the routine.

JETSON

You are married?

SYKES

Was.  Divorced.

JETSON

We mate for life.  Divorce... is a

strange concept to us.

SYKES

It's like having an eleventh finger

removed.  It hurts like hell, but

you never really needed the damn

thing in the first place.

JETSON

Your home is quite disordered.  I

thought perhaps you had been

burglarized when I walked in.

SYKES

(growling)

I appreciate your honesty, George.

SYKES

Ignore the bitch on the left, that's

Edie.  I call her Edi Amin... This

is Kristin, my daughter.  It's kinda

an old picture... she's twenty now.

Getting married, in fact... on

Sunday.

JETSON

Human children can be very

beautiful.

(then)

Getting married?  Congratulations.

You will be taking Sunday off,

then...

SYKES

(uneasy)

Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not

sure I'm gonna go.

(mumbles)

She doesn't need her burn-out of a

father there...

JETSON

(upbeat)

I must show you...

(flips open wallet,

shows four crisp

photos of his wife)

And this is Richard.  My son.  He's

four years old.  We named him after

the former President, Richard Nixon.

SYKES

You open to a piece of advice?  Tell

people you named him after Richard

Burton, the actor.  Just take my

word for it.

SYKES

... and so, and so the doctor says,

"If this is the thermometer, then

where'd I leave the pen?"

(laughs raucously,

Jetson doesn't

react)

You're not... you don't think that's

funny?  George, work with me, I

always get a laugh with that one.

Look, if the doctor's got the

thermometer in his hand, then

where's his pen gotta be?

JETSON

(straight-faced)

In the other man's rectum.

SYKES

(laughing)

Sticking out of his ass... yeah!

See, that's what makes it a joke.

There's like a surprise, and your

mind fills in the funny picture.

Here's this guy with a pen stuck in

his ass and he thinks it's a

thermometer.

(Jetson just blinks)

Nada, huh?

SYKES

(continuing)

Your health...

JETSON

Ta ss'trakyona'...

JETSON

There is so much our two peoples

don't understand about each other.

SYKES

No shit, Holmes.  You're only from

another goddamn planet, for

chrissakes.

JETSON

You humans are very curious to us.

You invite us to live among you, in

an atmosphere of equality we've

never known before.  You lay before

us a beautiful green world, full of

freedoms and opportunities... You

give us ownership of our lives for

the first time... and you ask no

more of us than you do of

yourselves: to live by the rules...

rules that aren't made to keep one

people subordinate to another, but

rules that exist to preserve

equality.  You aspire to very high

ideals here.

JETSON

(continuing)

I hope you can understand how

special your world is... how unique

a people you humans are.  So it us

all the more painful and confusing

to us that so few of you seem

capable of living up the the ideals

you set for yourselves.

SYKES

Don't count on me, George.  I never

had any ideals.

JETSON

We don't understand the hatred, the

contempt.  But we must bear it... we

must not react in anger... because

our situation here is still fragile.

The separationists would see us

returned to the quarantine camps.

The fundamentalists say we have no

more human rights than dogs or cats.

But the prejudice we face here is so

insignificant compared to the pain

that we've known before.  And that

is why we are so grateful.

SYKES

Yeah, well... except I did hear you

eat your dead.

JETSON

(deadpan)

Only on Fridays.

SYKES

You son-of-a-bitch.  You're okay.

JETSON

I'm going home.

SYKES

Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You

do sleep, don't you?

SYKES

What a wildman...

CUT TO:

SYKES

This better be good news or money.

JETSON

Hold this.

(lurching to the

sink)

I feel very terrible.

SYKES

Where'd you get this?!!

JETSON

A man, a human, was wiring it to

your car.  I didn't get a good look

at him.

(then, registering

that it's day;

panicked)

I must call my wife...

CUT TO:

JETSON

She's going to divorce me.

SYKES

George, she's not gonna divorce you.

You mate for life, remember?

JETSON

She's very progressive.  I'm certain

she's considering it.

SECRETARY

You guys are looking for somebody

named Strader, right?

SYKES

Yeah.

SECRETARY

Fedorchuk and Alterez just phoned

in.  They found him.

(Sykes and Jetson

react)

Or at least what's left of him,

washed up on the beach at Zuma.

SECRETARY

(continuing; handing

over  the message

slip)

They're still there if you wanna

catch them.

SYKES

Well, let's roll, George.

JETSON

(with a stricken

expression)

To the... to the beach?

SYKES

Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!

CUT TO:

JETSON (V.O.)

Stop the car.

SYKES (V.O.)

Why?

JETSON (V.O.)

Please, I must get out here.

SYKES (V.O.)

Come on, you won't have to get near

the water.

JETSON (V.O.)

Stop the car!

SYKES

All right, okay.  Keep your

pantyhose on.  Jeez, when in doubt,

freak out, for chrissake.

SYKES

(continuing)

It's all right, George.  It's cool.

Just wait here, all right?  I'll be

back in a coupla minutes.

JETSON

Thank you.

FEDORCHUK

Found his wallet in his jacket

pocket.  Joshua Strader, big as

life.

CORONER'S TECH

Jesus, what a mess.  It's gonna be a

bear to make a positive

determination, but it looks to me

like he was shot before being tossed

in the drink.  At least twice--

(indicates where

hearts  would've

been on the body)

-- here, and here.

SYKES

How're you two doing on Tuggle's

killer?

ALTEREZ

The store owner's son is in a street

gang, so now we're thinking maybe

it's gang related.

SYKES

Yeah, that's real good.  You guys

follow up on that for a coupla

months.

FEDORCHUK

Look at your dildo partner.  He's

too scared to even come down to the

sand.

(calls up to Jetson,

even though he's too

far away to hear)

You're not gonna get wet standing

here, moron!

SYKES

I'd like to see you next to a sea of

hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see

how much surfin' you'd do.

SYKES

Cute.

FEDORCHUK

Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson.

Forget you hip waders, big guy?

SYKES

Lay off, asshole.

FEDORCHUK

I may be an asshole, but at least

I'm a real detective, not some outer

shit space thing.

SYKES

Yeah?  you're a real honest-to-god

detective...?

SYKES

(continuing)

Then detect these!

JETSON

What was that about?

SYKES

(embarrassed that he

defended Jetson)

Nothing.

CUT TO:

SYKES

... So we've got three guys dead.

All Newcomers, all killed the same

way -- execution style.

JETSON

Warren Hubley was in middle

management at a refinery... Joshua

Strader operated a successful bar

and nightclub...

SYKES

... and Porter ran a piece of shit

mom-and-pop mini-mart.

(beat)

So what the hell's the connection?

CUT TO:

SYKES

You guys finished the postmortem on

Strader yet?

WINTER

(his mouth full)

You mean the Blob?  They're

finishing up now.

JETSON

Is Bentner here?  I must speak with

him.

WINTER

He went home early -- his kid was

sick.

WINTER

(continuing)

Yeah, but he left something for you.

WINTER

(continuing)

Does this have something to do with

the test he ran that he wouldn't

tell me about?

SYKES

(getting very curious

and suspicious now)

What kind of test?

WINTER

Looking for some foreign compound in

the blood of that alien you dropped

the other day.

SYKES

Did he find anything?

SYKES

(to Jetson)

Well?

JETSON

It is nothing.

SYKES

What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't

nothing yesterday when you asked

Bentner to run that test and he

looked like he was about to shit

peach pits, and it's not nothing

now.  Don't lie to me, George,

you're bad at it.

JETSON

(distant, closed)

You must leave me alone on this.

SYKES

No, see, I don't leave you alone...

I'm your partner.  I don't work that

way... Tug didn't work that way.

SYKES

(continuing)

No secrets, goddammit!  You don't

hold back from me.  Whatever is

going on, you're gonna tell me now!

JETSON

(agonizing)

No.  I cannot involve you.  This is

not your concern.

SYKES

The hell it isn't, when somebody

wires up enough C-4 explosive to my

car to turn me into pink mist!

(beat)

That Slag was on something, and not

sour milk, either?  Am I right?

(he has backed Jetson

to the wall by sheer

force of will)

TELL ME!  What is it?

JETSON

(finally)

... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us

it is a potent narcotic.

SYKES

How potent?

JETSON

Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The

"high" lasts several hours.  We

would receive small amounts of it...

as a reward for our labor.

SYKES

We?  You've taken it?

JETSON

We all did.

SYKES

Where did he get it?  Was there any

of it on the ship?

JETSON

No... I am sure not.  That is why I

am so concerned... someone must now

be producing it here.

(emphatically)

But none of my people know how to

make it.  The process was carefully

guarded.

SYKES

(as the enormity

sinks in)

Jesus, this is major.

(then)

Why didn't you tell me sooner?

Why'd you hold out on me?

JETSON

Your people don't know about this

part of out past.  And they can't

know -- It would threaten our entire

existence here.

SYKES

George... look me in the eye...

George, you don't ever lie to me

again.

JETSON

I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot

stop this without you.

CUT TO:

SYKES

George?  How about you drive...

SYKES

There's gotta be some other

connection.

OPERATOR

Here's Hubley.

(scanning it)

Left Quarantine on November

thirtieth, relocated first to

Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles

early in February the following

year.  Field of expertise: chemical

manufacturing.  Looks like he passed

up several other better paying jobs

waiting for that one at the

refinery.

SYKES

Try Joshua Strader, will ya,

darlin'?

OPERATOR

For you, anything.

OPERATOR

(continuing, reading

from screen)

Released on November twenty-ninth.

Came immediately to L.A.  Ten weeks

after arriving he took over the

abandoned club which is now

Encounters.

JETSON

(to Operator)

Now the store owner, please.  Cecil

Porter.

OPERATOR

Released December one.  He and his

wife moved first to Modesto, then

Coalinga, California -- wherever

that is -- settled in L.A. in

April.  Field of expertise:

organic chemical engineering.  He

and his wife have one child, a son.

SYKES

Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful

boy... close personal friend of

George's here.

OPERATOR

I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems

to be matching up...

SYKES

Holy shit...

(to Jetson)

Look what we're staring at: three

Newcomers with nothing in common,

right?  What if it's just one other

guy who killed these three?

(Jetson looks at him

blankly)

Three and one make four.  Four

Newcomers... of totally different

backgrounds...

(Jetson still doesn't

get it)

You and the store owner's son --

that punker!

JETSON

... Quarantine.

SYKES

Can you dig up their Quarantine

records in this thing?

OPERATOR

Sure.  Just a minute.

OPERATOR

(to herself)

Porter was in Lodge seven seven two.

CUT TO:

HARCOURT

Quite lovely...

(best)

What is your name again?

CASSANDRA

(flinching

involuntarily at

his touch)

Cassandra.

HARCOURT

(a chilling smile)

I will have to remember that...

CUT TO:

JETSON

They had months in quarantine to

develop the plan.  Porter, with his

chemistry background, must have

somehow come up with the formula for

the drug.  Hubley manufactured it --

at the refinery.  Strader, through

the nightclub, established a

distribution network.  And

Harcourt--

SYKES

Harcourt was the brain who brought

it all together.

SYKES

Okay, George -- we gotta play this

real smart.

JETSON

If the drug is here, we must destroy

it.

SYKES

No, George -- you're missing the

point.  The drug is evidence.  We

need to have the evidence, ya know?

SYKES

(continuing)

That's the guy...

O'NEAL

Hey, what are you, crazy?!  You

can't come in here like this!  Hey!

SYKES

So much for playing it smart...

SYKES

(tentatively

stepping closer)

Is that it...?

SYKES

Uh, George...

JETSON

(in O'Neal's face)

Where is the drug?  Where have they

taken it?

O'NEAL

(choking)

What drug?  This is an oil refinery,

you...

JETSON

(pushing harder)

WHERE?!

O'NEAL

(unable to breathe)

You... can't do... this!

SYKES

George, uh... you're gonna break his

little chest bones...

JETSON

Stay out of this, Matthew.

(to O'Neal)

Tell me where the drug has been

taken or I will crush your lungs

against this wall.

SYKES

Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he

gets like this, I can't control him.

I've seen this before.  He got like

this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's

spine out and show it to him.

Nothing I could do.  I hadda go

throw up.

O'NEAL

(at length, with

great effort)

... They took the stuff out, all of

it -- this afternoon.

JETSON

How much?

O'NEAL

About fifty kilos... of

concentrate... and some street

grade... in tubes.

JETSON

Where have they taken it?

O'NEAL

Encount... Encounters Club.

CUT TO:

SYKES

George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's

a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it

-- we got him by the short hairs.

He ain't gonna make any more of the

shit.

JETSON

The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to

find it.  I can't let it get out on

the street.

SYKES

Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?

SYKES

(continuing; as

Jetson starts the

car

You destroy that drug, you destroy

the case.  Don't blow the whole

thing now by not following

procedure.

JETSON

(through the open

driver's window)

Fuck procedure.

SYKES

Hey!!

SYKES

GEORGE!  GODDAMMIT!!

SYKES

Police.  Get out.  I need this

thing.  Out, now!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JETSON

I am here to take Harcourt.  Where

is he?

CASSANDRA

In there.

JETSON

(pulling his gun)

Show me.

HARCOURT

(to alien dealers)

It's been a long time, hasn't it,

gentlemen?

HUMAN DEALER

What is it?

HARCOURT

A sweet indulgence from out past...

resurrected for our future.

HARCOURT

(continuing; to

alien  dealers)

Please feel free to sample the

quality.  The experience will be

everything you remember it to be...

ALIEN DEALER

Where'd you get it?

HARCOURT

I arranged to spend some time with

three very resourceful men.  With a

certain amount of coaxing, one of

them was able to reconstitute the

formula for me.

(beat)

They worked very well together.

Unfortunately, they are no longer

with us... but I was fortunate

enough to reap the benefit of their

endeavor.

HUMAN DEALER

Let me try some.

(he does,

immediately spits

it out)

Jesus!  Tastes like detergent!

HARCOURT

And that's all the effect it will

have on you.  But when my fellow

Newcomers learn they can obtain it

here, they will work very hard... to

make as much money as they can... to

give it to me.

VOICE

You haven't told him all of it.

QUINT

He's got the C-4 charge!

QUINT

(continuing)

Just take it real casual, buddy.

Keep your finger on that button and

don't do nothing squirrely.

HARCOURT

If you release that button, you not

only kill us, but yourself.

JETSON

To get you and that--

(indicates drug in

suitcase)

-- I would do it.

JETSON

Everyone up against that wall.

Very slowly.

(to Harcourt)

Except you.

HARCOURT

One small matter seems to have

escaped your attention.  That--

(indicates suitcase)

-- is not on any books as a

controlled substance.  Legally it

might as well be fifty kilos of...

grape jelly.

JETSON

The charge is murder... and

conspiracy to commit murder.

Hubley, Porter, Strader... probably

others.

CASSANDRA

You... you killed Strader?

CASSANDRA

Where's Todd?!  Did you do something

to Todd?!

HARCOURT

Todd?  Who is Todd.

(then remembers;

smiles)

Ah, poor Mr. Watson.

JETSON

NOOO!

KIPLING

I got it!

HARCOURT

Kill them both.

KIPLING

Here?

HARCOURT

(raging)

Do it!

ALIEN DEALER

Don't shoot, man -- we're unarmed --

look!

SYKES

You okay?

CASSANDRA

(dazed, but all

right)

Yeah...

HARCOURT

Here!

JETSON

This way!

JETSON

Slow traffic on your right... you're

clear at the left rear...

(Sykes changes lanes)

Careful, red light ahead...

JETSON

Yellow light ahead turning red...

JETSON

(continuing; wide-

eyed)

Red light!  Red light!

JETSON

Green light, Matthew.

(Sykes doesn't

respond)

Green light!

SYKES

Shit!

JETSON

Ss-ai!

SYKES

Move your goddamned cars!

JETSON

There!

SYKES

Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're

history...

HARCOURT

No, Sergeant -- not history...

(beat)

Eternity...

DISSOLVE TO:

JETSON

With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I

assume you will be requesting

reassignment now.

SYKES

(cool)

It'd be for your own good.  I think

you'd be better off with a partner

who's a little more... by the book.

(smiles)

... Still, I gotta tell you, George,

for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on

wheels once you get going.  I'd

kinda hate to miss your next two

days as a detective.

WILTEY

I'll give you guys a lift to the

station.  They're waiting to take

your statements on the shootings.

SYKES

(to Jetson)

Let's go, partner.

(then casually

correcting Wiltey

as he rises)

And it's shooting.  Singular.

WILTEY

They said two.

SYKES

Nope.  I didn't shoot Harcourt... he

o.d.'d.

CUT TO:

DRIVER

So it's just me and her left in the

hot tub, right?

ATTENDANT

You and the blonde?

DRIVER

No, man, the redhead.  The blonde's

gone in the house with some other

guy.  But a few minutes later she

comes back out, alone, when me and

the redhead are going at it fast and

furious in the tub, ya know... and

she sees us, and... she climbs right

in with us...

ATTENDANT

You're full of shit!

DRIVER

I swear it!  If I'm lyin', I'm

dyin'...

CUT TO:

JETSON

You are certain this is the route

they would have taken?

WILTEY

I'm not positive -- but probably.

SYKES

(warily)

What's this about, George?  I know

that look.

JETSON

(spots something out

a side window)

There!  Go back.  Down that side

street.

JETSON

No!

(both Sykes and

Wiltey look at him)

We must do this alone.

SYKES

Do what?!  George-- ?!

WILTEY

Oh, God...

WILTEY

I'm calling for back up, now.

JETSON

Wiltey, no.

SYKES

What is this?!

JETSON

(low)

... It's Harcourt.

SYKES

Harcourt is dead.

JETSON

No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on

the drug.

(searches for the

words)

Massive amounts trigger a... a

change.  Your body functions seize

up, you appear to be dead, but it's

really a state of incubation.  When

you emerge you're...

SYKES

(looks at the four

bodies sprawled

before him)

Tell me about it...

CUT TO:

SYKES

I never thought I'd say this, but --

for once in my life I think I'm

willing to wait for back-up.

JETSON

We can't let him get away.

SYKES

Why the hell are you so dead set

against back-up?

JETSON

(a difficult

admission)

Because... because of what will

happen if humans see what we are

capable of becoming.

SYKES

But there's no more drug.

JETSON

You understand that.  But how many

others will?

WILTEY

There he is!

JETSON

Wiltey!

HARCOURT

(his voice a guttural

rumble)

Looking for me, Sergeant?

JETSON

On that boat -- out there!

CAPTAIN

Hey!

JETSON

Take it down!  Take it down!

JETSON

(to Pilot)

ALL THE WAY!

PILOT

I CAN'T IT'LL DITCH!

JETSON

(to Pilot)

Take it up!

PILOT

What the hell was that down there?

It was weird.

SYKES

Looked like every other damn slag to

me.  Just plain ugly.

LONG DISSOLVE TO:

SYKES

How do I look?

JETSON

You look very good.

KRISTIN

Ready, Daddy...?

SYKES

George, uh... I want to apologize

now, in advance, for all the rotten

things I'll ever say or do to you

over the years.

JETSON

That is all right, Matthew.  After

all, you are only human.

SYKES

(under his breath)

What a wildman...

FADE OUT.

THE END
