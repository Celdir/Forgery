SAVING MR. BANKS

Written by

Kelly Marcel & Sue Smith

OVER BLACK:

TRAVERS (V.O.)

(SINGING)

Winds in the East

Mist coming in--

FADE IN:

TRAVERS (V.O.)

--Like something is brewing,

about to begin--

TRAVERS (V.O.)

--Can't put me finger on what lies

IN STORE--

TRAVERS (V.O.)

--But I feel what's to happen, all

HAPPENED BEFORE--

DIARMUID

Mrs Travers.

DIARMUID PAMELA

DIARMUID

Excuse me?

PAMELA

The cherry blossoms

(BEAT)

I was trying to think of what they--

DIARMUID

The car should be here, may I use--

(THE PHONE)

PAMELA

(OVER)

I cancelled it.

DIARMUID

You--?

(PANICKED)

What? Pamela!

PAMELA

Mrs Travers.

DIARMUID

Mrs Travers, please, why--

(sugaring his tone)

Why would you cancel the car?

PAMELA

I shan't be going.

DIARMUID

We've been through this--

PAMELA

I've changed my mind.

DIARMUID

You can't.

PAMELA

With all due respect Mr Russell I

am on very good terms with my own

faculty and exceedingly confident

in its decision making

capabilities.

DIARMUID

You made an agreement. Do you

understand? A verbal agreement.

PAMELA

Why in the world are you speaking

to me as if I am a neonate?

DIARMUID

HE'LL--

PAMELA

He'll what? Sue? He is most welcome

to every penny I don't have.

DIARMUID

LOOK--

(HE SIGHS)

--I've represented you for a long

time. I like to think of you as a

FRIEND--

DIARMUID (CONT'D)

I like to think of it, believe me I

know it's not reciprocated.

(BEAT)

I would never suggest you do

something that would cause you

anguish but there's no more money

Pamela-- Mrs Travers. Simply no

more. Sales have dried up, no more

royalties. You refuse to write

further books so--

(BEAT)

Do you understand? I'm frightened

that you don't understand what that

means.

PAMELA

I know what he's going to do to her-

- she'll be cavorting and

twinkling! Careening towards a

happy ending like a kamikaze--

DIARMUID

--We've been trying to do this deal

for twenty years! He's agreed to

both your stipulations. No

animation, script approval-- I--

PAMELA

Use her to pay my bills? If I

believed in a hell I'd be sitting

in its waiting room--

DIARMUID

(OVER)

--script approval! He's never

granted anything like that before!

I don't know what else to--

DIARMUID (CONT'D)

Where is Polly?

PAMELA

I fired her.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

It's just as well. It seems I can't

afford her anymore anyway!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

(MOMENTARILY SOFT)

You don't know how much she means

to me.

DIARMUID

Polly?

PAMELA

Of course not Polly!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

(it's a filthy word)

Los Angeles.

DIARMUID

You have only to go there and work

for two weeks. Collaborate. That's

it. You haven't signed the rights

over, yet.

PAMELA

Yet!

DIARMUID

You must make it work Mrs Travers--

PAMELA

Oh I must, must I?

DIARMUID

You need the money. I don't want

you to see you-- (broke).

PAMELA

(OVER)

Stop saying money! It's a filthy,

disgusting word!

DIARMUID

I am picking up the telephone Mrs

TRAVERS--

PAMELA

I have final say?

DIARMUID

You do.

PAMELA

(TO HERSELF)

I have final say.

(TO DIARMUID)

(MORE)

PAMELA (CONT'D)

And if I don't like what they are

doing to her?

DIARMUID

You don't sign the papers. He

cannot make the film unless you

grant the rights.

(BEAT)

It's an exploratory trip--

DIARMUID (CONT'D)

What do you say?

PAMELA

(TO HERSELF)

I want to keep my house.

TRAVERS

Excuse me ma'am, have you seen my

daughter? I was quite sure I had

left her around here somewhere!

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

Her name is Helen, no, Shirley, erm-

- goodness! I've quite forgotten!

Could it be Prunella?

GINTY

No!

TRAVERS

Pamela?

GINTY

No.

TRAVERS

You're right still doesn't sound

quite-- I'm sure I have a special

name for her--

GINTY

Ginty!

TRAVERS

Why, thank you ma'am! Ginty it is

of course!

(BEAT)

Now, have you seen her?

GINTY

It's me!

TRAVERS

Gosh! So it is! Well, thank

goodness for that! I was positive I

was going to be beheaded for losing

Her Highness The Royal Princess

Ginty Mc Featherfluffy!

GINTY

You can't lose me!

TRAVERS

Never. I promise. I will never lose

you!

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

Hurry now! We mustn't be late! The

adventure is about to begin!

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Can I help you?

PAMELA

I'm perfectly capable thank you.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

They've used all the space; so

greedy.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

I'll take it Madam. I can put it

up here -

PAMELA

I don't want it up there. I want it

here, in the corresponding holding

area for my assigned seat!

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

The flight's closing in just a few

moments Ma'am. I'll have to take

it.

WOMAN

(TO ATTENDANT)

You can put my bag up front

instead.

PAMELA

(TO WOMAN)

Will the child be a nuisance? It's

an eleven hour flight.

WOMAN

(TAKEN ABACK)

Er-- no, I--

PAMELA

Jolly good.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

(TO HERSELF)

I hope we crash.

MARGARET

The carriage?

TRAVERS

Who needs a carriage my love? A

stroll is a gift!

(beat, excited)

Everybody ready?

GINTY & BIDDY

Yes. Yep!

TRAVERS

Come along my team! We mustn't miss

the train.

MARGARET

(to her staff)

Thank you so much. For everything.

GINTY

(TO NANNY)

See you soon Katie Nanna!

TRAVERS

Walking bus!

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

Don't forget Andrew!

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

Ready? And off we go!

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

Left, right, left, right! Coming

through!

GINTY

ALLORA--

PAMELA

Oh does he indeed?

RALPH

Travers? P.L. Travers?

PAMELA

Mrs.

RALPH

Welcome, Mrs P.L. Travers! Welcome

to the City of Angels.

RALPH (CONT'D)

Let me take those.

PAMELA

I'm perfectly capable of-- Oh,

nevermind.

RALPH

Sun came out to say hello just to

you.

PAMELA

Don't be preposterous.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

It smells. Like--

RALPH

Jasmine.

PAMELA

--chlorine and sweat.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

It's dreadful.

PAMELA

(TO HERSELF)

Absurd.

RALPH

You okay back there Mrs P.L.

Travers?

PAMELA

It's not Mrs P.L. It's just Mrs--

Oh, it's so hot.

RALPH

No problemo! We got a brand new air

conditioning system, Missus; cool

you right down in no time. Just

about make you feel like you're in

good old Engerland again! Things

they can put in cars these days--

(he shakes his head in

AMAZEMENT)

Gosh almighty.

RALPH (CONT'D)

(happy as a clam)

No problemo.

PORTER

Would you like me to unpack for you

ma'am?

PAMELA

Unpack?

PORTER

To take your items from their cases

and hang them in the wardrobe

ma'am.

PAMELA

Young man, if it is your wish to

handle ladies garments I suggest

you take employment in a

launderette.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Yes?

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Odd.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Oh my.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Oh no, no, no.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

(muttering to the pears)

This won't do.

TRAVERS

A palace! Complete with mighty

steed.

GINTY

And chickens.

MARGARET

OH--

TRAVERS

We'll build beautiful memories here

my angel.

MARGARET

Yes.

TRAVERS

(in the distance)

--in this house you get to share a

bedroom!

UNDERWATER

PAMELA

Good riddance.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

(TO HERSELF)

Well, first things first.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Good Lord.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

(TO MICKEY)

And you can stay there until you

learn the art of subtlety.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

There.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

(SATISFIED)

Yes.

(answering an imaginary

QUESTION)

Well, no, I don't suppose I do

mind.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Now, really! Flatterer!

(then scolding herself)

Silly girl.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Oh!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Soap for the brains.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Well, well-- There you are.

WALT

Don't worry! There's nothing wrong

with your television set. This is a

pixie bell, the sound is much too

high for human ears.

WALT (CONT'D)

Oh there you are Tink!

WALT (CONT'D)

(LAUGHING)

Hey! Get that stuff off of me!

(TO AUDIENCE)

You know, a little sprinkling of

fairy dust can make you fly!

PAMELA

Off! That's how we deal with you.

RALPH

Good morning Mrs!

PAMELA

It's not Mrs, it's-- Oh, why do I

bother? We're just not going to get

it right are we?

RALPH

Hm?

PAMELA

Will it be the same driver every

day?

RALPH

(oblivious to her tone)

Yes ma'am! I'm all yours.

(BEAT)

Sun came out again!

PAMELA

You say it like you're surprised.

Like the sun is particular about

whom it appears for. It seems you

think that I am responsible for

it's miraculous dawning every day.

For goodness sake, it's California!

RALPH

It certainly is!

RALPH (CONT'D)

(trying a British accent)

Madame.

PAMELA

(as much to herself as

RALPH)

I would so much rather be

accountable for the rain.

RALPH

Oh, that's sad.

PAMELA

Sad is entirely the wrong emotion.

I shan't bother explaining why;

IT'LL SIMPLY

(she makes gesture for

flying over his head)

Zip!

RALPH

Okey dokey.

PAMELA

The rain brings life!

RALPH

So does the sun.

PAMELA

Be quiet!

RALPH

Yes ma'am.

DON

Pamela! Good morning!

PAMELA

It is so discomfiting to hear a

perfect stranger use my first name.

Mrs Travers. Please.

DON

I do apologize, Mrs Travers.

(BEAT)

I am Don DaGradi, the script

writer.

PAMELA

Co-script-writer. I shall certainly

be having my say Mr. DiGraydi.

DON

Gradi. Wonderful! I welcome it.

PAMELA

If indeed we ever sign off on a

script.

DON

Uh. Okay, so this is the rest of

your team, Dick and Bob Sherman!

Music and lyrics.

(TO SHERMANS)

Boys, this is the one and only Mrs

P.L. Travers, creator of our

beloved Mary.

PAMELA

Poppins.

DON

Who else?

PAMELA

Mary Poppins. Never ever just Mary.

(to Dick and Bob)

A pleasure to meet you, though I

fear we shan't be acquainted for

too long.

BOB

Excuse me?

PAMELA

These books simply do not lend

themselves to chirping and

prancing. No. Certainly not a

musical. Now, where is Mister

Disney? I'd very much like to get

this started and finished as

briskly as is humanly possible.

BOB

Don?

DICK PAMELA

direction?

DON

Uh-- erm. Ha! We had planned a

little tour of the studio for you

MRS TRAVERS--

PAMELA

No thank you.

DON

--Wanted to show the place off.

PAMELA

No one likes a show off.

DON

Mrs Trav-- it's a long way to--

PAMELA

I am perfectly capable of walking.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Shoo! Go away!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Ghastly.

DON

(TO DOLLY)

Could you let--

PAMELA

(over, to Dolly)

Would you let Mister Disney know I

have arrived please?

DOLLY

(whispering into phone)

She's here!

DON

A word of advice Mrs Travers, if I

may.

PAMELA

You may. Whether I heed it or not

will be another matter entirely.

DON

Wow. Uhm. It's just that he can't

stand being called Mr Disney. We

are all on a first name basis here.

(TO DOLLY)

Dolly! Is he--?

WALT

Well, there ya are at last!

WALT (CONT'D)

Oh my dear gal!

WALT (CONT'D)

You can't imagine how excited I am

to finally meet you!

PAMELA

Oh!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Hum-- ah. It's an honour, Mister

Disney.

WALT

Walt, you gotta call me Walt, ya

know. `Mister Disney' was my old

man.

WALT (CONT'D)

Come here! Come here!

WALT

Tommie, say hi to the one and only

P L Travers!

TOMMIE

Hi there! It's so nice to--

WALT

Have a seat, sit down.

WALT (CONT'D)

Ya know, I can't believe it. P.L.

Travers, right here, in my office,

after all these years-- almost

twenty of `em.

(shakes his head)

Twenty. Long. Years.

WALT (CONT'D)

Wish ya coulda' seen me then Pam!

As lean as a whippet I was! A race

horse!

WALT (CONT'D)

But now, here you are. Look at you!

I could eat you up!

PAMELA

That wouldn't be appropriate.

WALT

When Diane here was seven years old

I-- can I get you a drink? Coffee?

Soda?

PAMELA

A pot of tea would be most welc--

WALT

(OVER)

She was seven years old and I was

walking past her bedroom and there

she was on her bed reading to

Sharon, and well, they were just

giggling their little socks off!

(he picks up the phone,

presses a button)

Tommie, pot of tea please dear--

You're a doll.

(he puts the phone down)

She's a doll. Anyways I asked them

"Girls, what's so funny?" And Diane

said to me, "Mary Poppins daddy!"

Well, I had no idea what a Mary

Poppins was! And then she gave me

your book. And by gosh!

WALT (CONT'D)

My imagination was caught on fire!

And I mean ON FIRE! And those

embers have burned ever since-- as

you know.

PAMELA WALT

PAMELA WALT

SAYING-- ASKING--

WALT (CONT'D)

I got old asking.

PAMELA

What a charming story.

WALT

About my getting old?

PAMELA

About your daughters.

WALT

Yeah I suppose it is.

(he looks at the picture)

They're both women now. Gosh! Can

you believe it?

PAMELA

Children grow up.

WALT

Now Pam, a man can't break a

promise to his kids. No matter how

long it takes to keep. No matter

how long! You might've kept me

dangling all this time but now we

gotcha!

PAMELA

Gotcha indeed! Mister Disney, if

you have dangled then it is at the

end of a rope you have fashioned

for yourself.

WALT

PAMELA--

PAMELA

I was quite clear when you

approached me the first time that

she wasn't for sale and clear again

when you approached me a year later

and clear again when you approached

me every annum for the subsequent

18 years. Honestly, I feel

corralled, ensnared--

WALT

Pam, Pam, the last thing I want is

to make you feel--

PAMELA

My name, if you please, is MRS

Travers.

WALT

You see, I promised them. That's a

fact. You got kids?

PAMELA

NOT--

WALT

(OVER)

I have never, I swear, never broken

a promise to either one of my

Disney girls.

PAMELA

Well, that's very honourable of you

BUT--

WALT

That's what being a daddy is all

about right?

PAMELA

(DEEP BREATH)

Is it?

WALT

This movie isn't just going to make

my kids happy. It's going to make

ALL kids happy! You see my guys are

gonna do things with it that are,

well, are revolutionary.

WALT (CONT'D)

REVOLUTIONARY,Pam!

PAMELA

OH DEAR--

WALT

Mary Poppins will literally fly off

the pages of your books!

WALT (CONT'D)

Now imagine! This magical woman who

has only lived in your head, you'll

be able to meet her, speak to her,

hear her sing.

PAMELA

Yes, this singing, I am glad you've

come to that.

(addressing his tea

MAKING)

Milk first!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

That's right. Now the tea--

PAMELA (CONT'D)

And a spoonful of sugar.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

You don't mean for this film to be

a musical?

WALT

(TAKEN ABACK)

I absolutely do!

PAMELA

No.

WALT

No?

PAMELA

No.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Not bad. No, Mister Disney, Mary

Poppins does not sing.

WALT

Oh yes she does!

PAMELA

When?

WALT

In your books!

PAMELA

Those aren't songs! They're

recitations. She is not a giddy

woman, she does not jig! Singing is

frivolous and wholly unnecessary

for a governess, an educatress. No.

It would just ruin it.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

I won't have her turned into one of

your silly cartoons.

WALT

Tell ya what. You just listen to

what my Sherman boys have come up

with and if they don't knock your

socks off then I'm the King of

England.

PAMELA

If you're the King of England then

you shan't exist and knowing the

little of you I do; I shouldn't

think you would like that very

much.

WALT

Bet you would.

PAMELA

(BEAT)

I do quite like Greensleeves.

WALT

Greensleeves huh?

PAMELA

Come to think of it. That's a song

I wouldn't object to.

WALT

Greensleeves.

PAMELA

Yes.

WALT

Pam, I want you to know that the

last thing I would do, the very

last thing, is tarnish a story I

have cherished.

WALT (CONT'D)

(gazing into her eyes)

The pages are worn down to tissue,

dog eared and falling out. I have

poured over them gripped,

tormented. Because I love Mary

Poppins, you got to share her with

me.

WALT (CONT'D)

A course nothing happens without

your say so. Absolutely Nothing.

PAMELA

Quite right.

WALT

It's all in the rights agreement.

As approved by your agent, Dermot.

PAMELA

Diarmuid.

WALT

Darmitt.

PAMELA

(waving the agreement)

A live action film. No animation.

WALT

Live action.

PAMELA

I'd like that on tape.

WALT

Hm?

PAMELA

Your promise-- and all the

discussions we have here-- on tape.

WALT

Tape you say.

PAMELA

Ah there you are.

(BEAT)

Mary Poppins and the Banks's,

they're family to me.

WALT

I understand. I do.

PAMELA

Well then!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Shall we begin?

WALT

Let's make something wonderful.

PAMELA

Let's see if that's at all

possible.

WALT

(PERPLEXED)

Woah.

(BEAT)

Damn.

MARGARET

It's rather late--

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Biddy and Moya are already asleep.

TRAVERS

Ginty.

GINTY

Good night father.

(BEAT)

`night mother.

MARGARET

Good night dear.

TRAVERS

I'll make us a good life.

(BEAT)

I promise.

(BEAT)

I'll make you proud again.

MARGARET

Look at the stars.

PAMELA

(peering around a vase at

DAGRADI)

What is all this jollification?

DON

We have a whole script to get

through. It's gonna be a long day

Mrs T.

DON (CONT'D)

--ravers.

PAMELA

We could save a starving country

with benefaction from this room

alone! Ugh, It's so vulgar.

BOB

(SEETHING)

That is a very expensive piano.

PAMELA

And these are beautiful blooms

butchered for our visual and nasal

enjoyment when we could have just

as easily gone to the window,

looked out and gazed upon them

happily minding their own business

and very much still alive.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Let us begin.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Hm.

DON DAGRADI PAMELA

(READING) (READING)

DON

Exterior. It means the scene is

taking place outside.

PAMELA

Ah, I see, an abbreviation.

(BEAT)

Scene One. Exterior--

(BEAT)

Oh, I'm sorry Mr DaGradi, did you

feel you should--?

DON

No, No, Mrs Travers please go

ahead.

PAMELA

Yes, I do think it's best. I've the

most practise. Readings of my books

you know? Anyway--

(BEAT)

Scene one. Exterior. 17 Cherry Tree

Lane, London. Day.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Yes. That's good, that can stay.

DICK

(LAUGHING)

That's just the scene heading!

PAMELA

--Though I do think we should say

number 17, instead of just 17, yes?

It's proper.

BOB & DICK

No one's going to see it.

PAMELA

I will see it.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Write it down, write it down, chop

chop.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Is that on the tape?

DON

Yes.

PAMELA

Good-- onwards.

DOLLY

I'm sorry to interrupt.

PAMELA

Is this a joke?

DOLLY

Excuse me?

PAMELA

Do you think you are a comedienne?

DOLLY

I'm sorry I don't understand.

PAMELA

Unbelievable.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Scene One. Exterior. Number 17

Cherry Tree Lane. London. Day.

(MORE)

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Bert, a one-man band--

(she looks up)

The rumour is that this is to be

your Mister Van Dyke is it?

DICK

We do hope so!

PAMELA

Hmmm, we'll see about that. He's

totally wrong, totally and utterly.

BOB

Dick is one of the greats!

PAMELA

Dick Van Dyke? Robert, my dear,

Olivier is one of the greats,

Burton, Guinness - greats without

question.

(speaking loudly into the

TAPE RECORDER)

I can assure you Dick Van Dyke is

not.

(back to script)

Bert, a one-man band plays to a

small gathering outside the gates

to the park.

(BEAT)

BERT SAYS--

(she looks to Don)

You can do Bert.

DON

(through gritted teeth)

Thank you.

(BEING BERT)

Alright Ladies and gents, comical

poem, suitable for the occasion--

DON (CONT'D)

--extemporized and thought up

before your very eyes! Alright,

here we go--

DICK

(SINGING)

Room here for everyone gather

around,

THE CONSTABLE'S

BOB/DICK

"responstable."

DICK

Now, how does that sound?

PAMELA

No no no no no no no.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Responstable is not a word.

DICK

(EXCITED)

We made it up!

PAMELA

Well, un-make it up.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

I've a thought! I've always liked

Ta Ra Ra Boom De Ay. Now, that

would be a wonderful song for the

film! Oh! And Admiral Boom could

sing it! Do you see?

PAMELA

Irresponstable.

CLOSE ON:

TRAVERS

Ahhh, there's my girl.

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

That's it Albert. Give Ginty a

smooch. There's a good boy, give

her a little smooch.

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

Poor old Albert; he's your secret

uncle you know? But a miserable,

horrid witch turned him into a nag.

GINTY

Why did she do that?!

TRAVERS

Because she hated the sound of his

laugh.

GINTY

Poor Uncle Albert! How can we fix

him?

TRAVERS

We have to teach the witch how to

be happy again.

GINTY

How?

TRAVERS

I'm not quite sure darling.

(BEAT)

Your mother's been calling you for

a good hour. I shouldn't go if I

were you, she's after little slaves

for housework!

(RECITING YEATS)

Ah, I must scrub and bake and sweep

Till stars are beginning to blink

AND PEEP;

And the young lie long and dream in

THEIR BED

Of the matching of ribbons for

bosom and head.

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

Do you want to know what it feels

like to fly Ginty?

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

You trust me?

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

Gee up, Albert. Yah!

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

Yah!

PAMELA

Nobody walks.

RALPH

(SADLY)

Leisurely stroll's a gift.

RALPH

Beautiful ain't it?

PAMELA

(refusing him the

SATISFACTION)

If you like that sort of thing.

RALPH

I do.

DON

We do find it helps to have a

visual. It's fun!

PAMELA

No, no, no. Goodness no.

DICK

No?

PAMELA

The Banks house doesn't look like

that! My house is a terraced house

with a pink door, white bricked

with a crack in the gable. The

window frames are lead-lined and

the flower boxes grow pink

nasturtiums to go with the pink

DOOR AND--

(gesturing to the tape

RECORDER)

Did we get that?

(to herself, slightly

HYSTERICAL)

Oh dear, it's all a big mistake.

It's all wrong.

DON

It's all wrong?

PAMELA

It's too grand! The Banks family -

they're normal, everyday sort of

people. This isn't normal. It isn't

everyday! They're not aristocrats!

DICK

Interesting.

PAMELA

(TO HERSELF)

Okay.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

(SIGHING)

Do I even have to say it?

DON

Um-- yeah?

PAMELA

Why in the world have you made Mrs

Banks a silly suffragette?

BOB

I wonder if Emmeline P would agree

with that adjective--

PAMELA

Quite possibly, looking back.

DON

It does seem strange that Mrs Banks

allows her children to spend all of

their time with the nanny when she

has no job to speak of--

PAMELA

Are you calling Mrs Banks

neglectful?

BOB

Yep.

DON

No! Of course not! We just felt

that if she had a job it would go

some way to explaining--

PAMELA

Being a mother is a job. A very

difficult job and one that not

everybody is up to, that not

everybody should have taken on in

the first place!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

I will NOT have her called Cynthia!

Absolutely not. It feels unlucky.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

No it should be something warm, a

PAMELA (CONT'D)

How about Mavis?

DON

Sybil?

BOB

Sure.

PAMELA

Prudence?

DICK

Gwendolyn?

BOB

Great.

PAMELA

Winifred!

DON

I could go with Winifred.

PAMELA

Yes, that's because it's very good.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

This isn't Mr Banks?

PAMELA (CONT'D)

This isn't him.

DON

Ahm, yeah, that's him--

PAMELA

He has a set of moustaches!

DON

In the books he--

PAMELA

I told the illustrator I didn't

like the facial hair but she chose

to ignore me. This is MY film and

this time around I shall have MY

way.

DOLLY

(clearing her throat)

Mrs Travers, it was a specific

request, from Walt.

PAMELA

(to the boys)

Why?

PAMELA (CONT'D)

He didn't, he doesn't, Mr Banks is

clean shaven!

BOB

Does it mattterrrrrrr?!

DON

Bob, Bob, Bob--

PAMELA

You can wait outside!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

I shan't say it again Robert.

BOB (O.S.)

KILL ME! KILL ME NOW!

PAMELA

(TO DICK)

What is wrong with his leg?

DICK

He got shot.

PAMELA

Hardly surprising.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Can I expect anymore drama from

anyone else?

GINTY

Why do you do that?

TRAVERS

For you my dear!

(he flicks the blade in

the air like a swordsman)

Swish! Which kind of kisses do you

prefer Gintamina? Swoosh! Scratchy

ones or silky ones?

GINTY

(THINKS)

Silky ones.

A man must shave for to spare his

daughter's cheeks! Swish!

PAMELA

Swish.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Swoosh.

PAMELA (O.S.)

Stop! Stop! Stop! What on earth are

you talking about? Supercali--?

Supercali-- or whatever the

infernal thing is!

DICK

It's something to say when you

don't know what to say!

PAMELA

Well I always know what to say.

PAMELA (O.S.) (CONT'D)

If you so much as step one foot in

here with that tray I shall scream!

One cannot live on cake alone!

DISNEY

Hit me with it.

DOLLY

She has a lot of-- ideas.

DISNEY

Ya? What kind of ideas?

DOLLY

About how she, uh, sees things.

DISNEY

And just how does she `see' things?

DOLLY

(READING)

The name Cynthia has been changed

to Winifred.

WALT

Okay that'll work.

DOLLY

She won't approve Dick Van Dyke.

DOLLY (CONT'D)

The sketches of the Banks house

make it look too opulent, there

must be no hint of romance between

Mary Poppins and Bert, she wants to

know why Mr Banks has been given a

moustache, the--

WALT

I asked for that.

DOLLY

Yes. They did tell her but she

wants to know why.

WALT

Because I asked for it.

DOLLY

Right. Of course. Uh-- the tape

measure Mary Poppins uses to record

Jane and Micheal's height must be a

roll tape, not a ruler, we must add

gravi-- gravitas, she says.

DISNEY

Gahd! Anything else?

DOLLY

She only wants green vegetables and

broth, I don't know what that is

but she wants it in the room from

now on and oh! She doesn't want the

colour red in the film-- at all.

PAMELA

I've simply gone off the colour.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

You did say I was to have final say

did you not?

DISNEY

We can't make the film without the

colour red! It's set in London for

pete's sake.

PAMELA

And?

DISNEY

There's buses and mail boxes and

guards uniforms-- heck! The British

flag! Pamela, I'm not sure why

YOU'RE--

PAMELA

I understand your predicament Mr

Disney, I do. I just-- hm-- I don't

know what it is, I'm just suddenly

very anti-red. I shan't be wearing

it ever again.

DISNEY

Is this a test Pam? Are you

requiring proof of how badly I

wanna make you happy so that we can

create this beautiful thing

together?

PAMELA

I took you at your word Mr Disney

and it seems my first stipulation

has been denied. There will be many

more, so-- perhaps we should just

call it quits and I should hand you

back these?

DISNEY

Alright. No red in the film.

DON

What?!

DICK

Walt?

BOB

He doesn't have the rights--

PAMELA

Quite.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Now, If you're insisting upon this

musicality you feel is SO important

for my film then I suggest I hear

one of your ditties.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

I shall keep an open mind!

DICK

Nanny?

DON

Yeah, do nanny.

Wanted a nanny for two adorable

Alright.

DISNEY POV:

WALT

Tommie!

TOMMIE

Scotch Mist.

WALT

What do you think?

TOMMIE

What do I think I-- what?

WALT

You're a woman.

TOMMIE

That's a canny observation Walt.

WALT

What am I missing?

TOMMIE

You think the female of the species

has some kind of psychic insight

when it comes to others of her

kind?

TOMMIE (CONT'D)

We don't.

(BEAT)

You'll get yourself an ulcer with

all that unriddling. Give it up.

WALT

That woman.

BARMAN

Good afternoon Ma'am. What can I

fix you?

PAMELA

A pot of tea.

BARMAN

Sure thing.

PAMELA

Thank you. Tea is a balm for the

soul don't you agree?

GINTY

Thank you.

BANK WORKER

Good afternoon Mr Belhatchett.

TRAVERS

(TO CLERK)

Belhatchett. Bell. Hatchett. Ha!

It's a ridiculous moniker!

CLERK

SIR--

TRAVERS

And Mr Belhatchett has complained

that I opened his stupid bank five

minutes late has he? Hahaaa!

(in a comedy voice)

Time's Money, Goff, y'know! Time's

money my man!

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

Bell Hatchett! Beautiful hatchet.

That's what it means. And I suppose

if the poor dumb lambs on his

downs, are five minutes late with

their calving, or they don't drop

dead on schedule when he wants a

roast, he takes to them with the

business end of his beautiful

hatchet.

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

There, whack! That'll teach you for

not dropping your bairns on

schedule. Whack! Whack! Whack!

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

Whack. Whoops!

(through the door)

Mr Belhatchett! Allow me to--

TRAVERS (CONT'D)

Ginty!

RANDOLPH

I want you gone.

TRAVERS

Sweet thing! What are you doing

here?

GINTY

You said today was--

TRAVERS

Ice cream day! Yes! I did! What

kind of father am I?

GINTY

(SCARED)

Are you fired again?

TRAVERS

Ah, yes it does seem that--

RANDOLPH

(TO GINTY)

No. No sweetheart-- he isn't.

TRAVERS

(TO GINTY)

Just wait in my office for a second

darling.

RANDOLPH

If you can't straighten up for your

own sake. Do it for your daughter.

(muttering to himself)

Irresponsible.

TRAVERS

Ice cream is so rare because it

only comes from Siberian cows. Did

you know that?!

(BEAT)

Brrrrrrrr!

TRAVERS

We share a Celtic soul, you and I.

This world is just an illusion,

Ginty old girl. As long as we hold

that thought dear, they can't break

us. Money, money, money. Don't you

buy into it Ginty! It'll bite you

on the bot!

How did we end up here eh? Look at

it. Barren. Breathless.

Get as far away from this place as

possible my love. Find yourself a

patch of green.

(HE SIGHS)

It's a chimera you know? The world,

the bank, you and I, Mr Randolph-

whackety-whack-Belhatchett. All an

illusion.

PAMELA

(INTO PHONE)

I loathe this place, Mr Russell.

How can a place so sunny be so

cold?

PAMELA (CONT'D)

I meant heartless. I'm afraid a

jumper wouldn't suffice. It's

bringing up these-- it's so hot and

stuffy I feel like I am being

attacked. These odd dreams, like my

subconscious is after me. Punishing

me for entertaining the idea that I

might hand her over. I am at war

with myself Mr Russell.

(BEAT)

The script is ghastly, exactly as I

EXPECTED--

(BEAT)

Yes, a few more days and then I'll

DECIDE--

(BEAT)

I know, I know I need the money.

The money. The money.

(TO HERSELF)

Money. It'll bite you on the--

(INTO PHONE)

It's all an illusion you know Mr

Russell? All an illusion.

(BEAT)

Very well. Good morning and

goodnight.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Serves me right. Money, money,

money. Bit me on the bot.

DICK

It's gotta be like a slogan!

BOB

Her prescription for life.

DICK

Yeah! Yes! A stitch in time!

BOB

An apple a day.

DON

(from across the room)

Time and tide wait for--

BOB

Sugar!

DICK

Sugar?

DICK (CONT'D)

What? That's not--

BOB

Jeff had vaccination day at school

yesterday.

DICK

Ouch.

BOB

No ouch.

DICK

No ouch?

BOB

Sugar. They put it in a cube.

DICK

Medicine in sugar?

BOB

Cube's an odd word.

BOB (CONT'D)

Spoonful?

DON

(UNDER)

Yeah, we have sugar.

WALT

May I walk with you?

PAMELA

I'm sure your country doesn't have

any laws about sharing a pavement.

BOB

Go back to the chorus.

DICK & BOB

(singing it incorrectly)

Just a spoonful of sugar helps the

medicine go down!

BOB

Wait! WAIT! She always does what's

unexpected.

She goes UP the bannisters.

BOB (CONT'D)

So go up.

BOB (CONT'D)

Try B.

DICK & BOB

(singing `down' in an up

KEY)

Just a spoonful of sugar helps the

medicine go down.

DICK

Yes!

DON

Man is in the forest.

DON (CONT'D)

(TO WALT)

I want you to hear this.

(to the boys)

Play him what you got.

DICK

It's just a chorus--

BOB

Tell us what you think.

He knows dum dum

Will help dum dum dum duuuum!

DICK

(SINGING)

Just a spoonful of sugar helps the

medicine go down--

the medicine go do-own,

medicine go down

Just a spoonful of sugar

helps the medicine go down

In a most de da dee daaa!

BOB

We'll work out the other lyrics.

DICK

You see how it goes up on the word

down?

BOB

On the word down it goes up!

PAMELA

(UNHAPPY)

Up.

DON

It's ironic.

PAMELA

Is it?

WALT

Forget ironic, it's iconic.

PAMELA

(SARCASTIC)

Bravo.

WALT

I won't be able to stop singing

that for weeks!

PAMELA

It seems enormously patronising to

me. The very sort of annoying tune

you would have playing in your

themed park I daresay. All giddy

and carefree, encouraging children

to face the world unarmed. All they

need is a spoon and some sugar and

a brain full of fluff and they're

equipped with life's tools.

Wonderful!

WALT

What's your point Pam?

PAMELA

MRS Travers! My point is that,

unlike yourself, Mary Poppins is

the very enemy of sentiment and

whimsy. She is truthful, she

doesn't sugar coat the darkness in

the world that these children will

eventually come to know. She

prepares them for it, she deals in

honesty. One must clean one's room;

it won't magically do it itself!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

This whole script is flim flam!

Where is its reality? Where is its

heart, where is the gravitas?

PAMELA (CONT'D)

No weight Mister Disney! See?

WALT

No whimsy or sentiment says the

woman who sends a flying nanny with

a talking umbrella to save the

children.

PAMELA

You think Mary Poppins is saving

the children Mr Disney?

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Oh dear.

PAMELA

(TO HERSELF)

It goes up.

MARGARET

There there. Shush shush now--

MARGARET (CONT'D)

If you could just--

TRAVERS

Ahoy Goffs!

GINTY

MARGARET

What a lovely surprise! Did you

finish early?

TRAVERS

I couldn't stop thinking about my

beautiful girls on this beautiful

day in this beautiful place and I

thought to hell with it!

(to Ginty and Biddy)

And what do we say about beauty

ladies?

GINTY/BIDDY/TRAVERS

A thing of beauty is a joy forever!

MARGARET

BUT--

TRAVERS

Buts are for goats my love!

GINTY & BIDDY

Urgh!

TRAVERS

(whispering to Margaret)

I'll put in extra hours tomorrow.

(TO GINTY)

What are we playing?

GINTY

The hen got out and we've been

trying to catch her!

TRAVERS

That's no hen! That's Aunt Ellie,

your mother's horrendiferous

sister!

GINTY

(LAUGHING)

That's a made up word!

BIDDY

Really?!

GINTY

Not the aunt!

(BEAT)

Quick! Catch her before she flies

Oh!

Though her words are simple and few

YOU--

EXEMPLARY

Then came this person, with chaos

in her wake

And now my life's ambitions go with

one fell blow

It's quite a bitter pill to take.

WALT

Inspired by someone we know?

DICK

(FEIGNING INNOCENCE)

You'd have to ask Bob.

DICK (CONT'D)

She might surprise us all.

WALT

She won't.

DICK

You don't know that.

WALT

I do. I know it, I know it only too

well.

I've fought this battle from her

side. Pat Powers, he wanted the

mouse and I didn't have a bean back

WALT (CONT'D)

He was this big terrifying New York

producer and I was just a kid from

Missouri with a sketch of Mickey

but-- it woulda' killed me to give

him up.

WALT (CONT'D)

Honest to god killed me. That

mouse, he's family.

Go home.

The world is an illusion Ginty.

Ahh the Countess Mary Sparklestick!

Pray tell me, what are you

concentrating so hard on?

Mine like to make folded paper--

And would you tear up those gifts?

In front of them?!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

It's a dreadful thing to do! I

shall send a guide to show them the

way to the magical ladder which

will bring them all the way up to

SEE US"

GINTY

And who do you think those

sparkling messengers sent? Who was

it that came flying through the

starry, starry sky to carry us up

to see them?

BIDDY

An elf?

GINTY

Their old Uncle Albert of course!

(beat, to Biddy)

Stay right here, be good--

BIDDY

Are you going to the sky?

GINTY

I'm going to find the end of the

story so I can bring it back for

you!

BIDDY

Is it happy?

MARGARET

Sometimes a person we love, through

no fault of his own, can't see past

the end of his nose.

GINTY

It's time to go home, ma.

PAMELA

(INTO PHONE)

Mrs Travers! Hello!

WALT

(coughs into phone)

Pam!

PAMELA

(DISAPPOINTED)

Mr Disney.

WALT

Callin' to check up on you.

PAMELA

Are you a doctor?

WALT

Hm?

PAMELA

Check ups are for medical

practitioners no?

WALT

Pam, are you always so battle

ready? P.L. Travers in her breast

plate and chain mail, sword up in

the air and off with your head!

PAMELA

What can I do for you Mister

Disney?

WALT

Please, I beg of you, please please

call me Walt.

PAMELA

Walt-- er.

WALT

I heard things didn't go so well

today.

PAMELA

They went as well as they've gone

every other day that I've been

here. I don't recall `special'

phone calls from you on any of

those other evenings.

WALT

What's this all about Pam? Really?

WALT (CONT'D)

I'm wondering what I have to do to

make you happy.

PAMELA

Ha!

WALT

Aren't you wondering that too?

WALT (CONT'D)

(he has an idea)

You know, you've never been to

Disneyland! It's the happiest place

on Earth!

(shouting away from the

PHONE)

Tommie! Cancel my morning tomorrow.

I'm taking a ride with my favorite

author!

(INTO PHONE)

Any excuse.

PAMELA

I cannot tell you how uninterested,

no, positively sickened I am at the

thought of going to see your dollar

printing machine Mr-- Walter.

WALT

Oh come on! When does anybody get

to go to Disneyland with Walt

Disney himself?!

PAMELA

Disappointments are to the soul

what the thunderstorm is to the

air.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Hello? Hello? He hung up! I'm! I! I

can't believe he hung up!

WALT

I'm not a violent man Tommie but if

Mrs P.L. Travers were to get hit by

a large truck I--

(he doesn't allow himself

TO FINISH)

WALT

Okay boys. We gotta fix this.

MARGARET (O.S.)

Oh my!

AUNT ELLIE (O.S.)

Margaret, my poor child. I simply

had to come. We must fix this.

TRAVERS

The Aunt.

ELLIE

Now, I've brought every new fangled

treatment available in Sydney.

ELLIE (CONT'D)

Close your mouth please Biddy, we

are not a codfish.

(to both girls)

I spy a multitude of jobs to be

done!

MARGARET

They've been so worried-- I've--

ELLIE

Do stop babbling nonsense! I'm here

now and I shall fix everything.

(BEAT)

Girls!

(BEAT)

Feverfew and camomile to lower his

body temperature. Garlic, sorrel,

sage. Deadly nightshade. And if

those don't work-- well I shouldn't

like to say.

ELLIE (CONT'D)

--tincture of horseradish--

LAUDANUM--

(to Ginty and Biddy)

(MORE)

ELLIE (CONT'D)

I thought I had made it quite clear

you were to begin helping.

ELLIE (CONT'D)

Spit spot!

PAMELA

Where are we--? This isn't the way.

RALPH

Change of venue this morning

apparently.

PAMELA

(realizing where she's

BEING TAKEN)

Ugh.

RALPH

I was thinking about our-- tea

party?

PAMELA

I'm sure I don't know what you're--

RALPH

(OVER)

Yesterday, the little park.

PAMELA

Little park? I haven't a clue what

you're talking about.

RALPH

BUT--

PAMELA

Concentrate on the road. Always

chitter chattering!

RALPH

Oh! Isn't that nice? Holy mackerel!

Wowzers. Never met him myself but

there he is! Right there. Real.

Living, breathing. Oh boy!

WALT

Welcome to the Magic Kingdom!

PAMELA

Is it all like this?

WALT

Yup! Isn't it wonderful?

PAMELA

Do you always get everything you

want Walter?

WALT

Pretty much!

PAMELA

With the exception to the rights to

my books of course!

WALT

War ain't over yet Pam!

YOUNG WOMAN

I love you so much! Can I--?

PAMELA

(DISGUSTED)

Pre-signed?

WALT

(TO WOMAN)

You should get hers too.

(gesturing to Pamela)

This woman's a bona fide genius!

WALT

In Adventureland there is a tree--

this is a fun fact. A titbit.

PAMELA

Tidbit.

WALT

(OVER)

It has three million leaves, four

million flowers.

PAMELA

Gosh.

WALT

And they said only God could make a

tree!

WALT (CONT'D)

Where did she come from?

PAMELA

Who?

WALT

I think you know who.

PAMELA

She flew in through the window one

day.

WALT

Through the window huh?

WALT (CONT'D)

It's just that easy isn't it Mrs

Travers?

WALT (CONT'D)

I know you don't wanna be here so

I'm gonna take you to one ride-- my

favourite amusement and then I'll

set you free.

WALT

Mrs Travers, I would be honoured if

you would ride Jingles. She's Mrs

Disney's favourite horse.

PAMELA

No thank you. I'm happy to watch.

WALT

No greater joy than that seen

through the eyes of a child.

WALT (CONT'D)

There's a child in us all.

PAMELA

Maybe in you Mister Disney, but

certainly not I.

WALT

Get on the horse Pamela!

WALT (CONT'D)

When we first met, you said to me

`they're family.'

PAMELA

I said what?

WALT

Mary Poppins, the Banks's, they're

family.

(BEAT)

The boys have had an idea for your

Mister Banks. I think it'll make

you happy.

PAMELA

You brought me all the way out here

to tell me that?

WALT

No. I brought you all the way out

here for monetary gain. Had a wager

with the boys that I couldn't get

you on a ride. I win!

WALT (CONT'D)

Yah!

ELLIE

Well begun, is half done!

DON

Good morning Mrs Travers!

PAMELA

What horrors have you in store for

my beautiful characters today, hm?

DON

Now, Mrs Travers you sit here.

DON (CONT'D)

We thought about what you said Mrs

Travers and Mr Banks isn't cruel.

He isn't. We've got a new ending

for the film. Oh god, I hope you

like it.

DON (CONT'D)

(AS MICHAEL)

Michael says, "He mended it! It's

wonderful!"

DOLLY

(AS JANE)

However did you manage it?

PAMELA

(TO HERSELF)

He mended it?

DICK

(SINGING)

With tuppence for paper and strings

You can have your own set of wings

With your feet on the ground

You're a bird in flight

with your fist holding tight

To the string of your kite

Oh oh oh oh

DICK & BOB

Let's go fly a kite

Up to the highest height

Let's go fly a kite and send it

SOARING

Up through the atmosphere

Up where the air is clear

Oh let's go fly a kite

DON

And then Mrs Banks goes to fetch

her suffragettes ribbon.

DOLLY

(as Mrs Banks)

"A proper kite needs a proper tail

don't you think?!"

BOB/DICK/DON/DOLLY

Let's go fly a kite

Up to the highest height

BOB/DICK/DON/DOLLY (CONT'D)

Let's go fly a kite and send it

SOARING

BOB/DICK/DON/DOLLY/PAMELA

Up through the atmosphere

Up where the air is clear

Oh let's go fly a kite

DICK

When you send it flying up there

All at once you're lighter than air

DICK (CONT'D)

You can dance on the breeze over

houses and trees--

DOLLY

Mr Disney! Walt!

DOLLY (CONT'D)

I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just

she-- she's dancing! Mrs Travers.

She's dancing with Don!

DICK (V.O.)

With your fist holding tight

To the string of your kite

BOB/DICK/DON/PAMELA

Oh Oh Oh Oh

Let's go fly a kite

Up to the highest height

Let's go fly a kite and send it

SOARING

Up through the atmosphere

Up where the air is clear

Oh let's go fly a kite!

PAMELA

Well.

BOB

Well?

PAMELA

Yes! He fixes the kite! Oh, I love

it!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Though proper English would be `Let

us go and fly a kite.'

PAMELA (CONT'D)

But I might be willing to overlook

that.

BOB

Did we get that on tape?

TRAVERS

Look at you-- all ship shape.

GINTY

I re-wrote the poem father.

GINTY (CONT'D)

The aunt gave me tuppence.

GINTY (CONT'D)

Shall I buy you something father?

TRAVERS

(BARELY AUDIBLE)

PEARS--

PAMELA

Father?

PAMELA

Do you know you're quite right? It

is beautiful. Exquisite.

RALPH

It's always new.

DON

(TO PAMELA)

So Jolly Holiday's in?

PAMELA

As you wish.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Now, how in the world does Mister

Disney propose to train penguins to

dance?!

BOB

Are you serious?

PAMELA

I've heard about his implausibly

leaved trees so I assume he does

have some insane penguin wrangling

scheme but it does seem rather far

fetched. Can you train penguins?

DON

(LAUGHING)

No I don't think you can train an

ACTUAL--

DICK

(OVER)

They're animated.

PAMELA

Sorry?

DON

Dick.

DICK

Cartoons.

DON

Dick.

DON (CONT'D)

Crap.

DICK

What? Are we getting real penguins?

DOLLY

Good afternoon Mrs Travers!

PAMELA

Where is Mister Disney?

DOLLY

If you'd like to take a seat--

PAMELA

I would not like to take a seat

thank you. I would like to--

DOLLY

Mrs Travers, please!

PAMELA

DISNEY!

TOMMIE

Walt, I'm so sorry.

WALT

Don't worry Tommie, please close

the door.

WALT (CONT'D)

Never let anybody see me smoking.

I'd hate to encourage bad habits.

Please, sit down.

PAMELA

I shall not sit in the seat of a

trickster! A fraudster! A sneak!

WALT

PAMELA--

PAMELA

MRS TRAVERS. PLEASE!

WALT

Mrs Travers, what in the world has

upset you so?

PAMELA

Penguins!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Penguins have very much upset me

Mister Disney! Animated, dancing

penguins! Now, you have seduced me

with the music Mr Disney, yes you

have. Those Sherman boys have quite

turned my head but I shall not be

moved on the matter of cartoons.

Not one inch sir!

WALT

It's a sequence--

PAMELA

You promised me. You promised me

that this film would not be an

animation!

WALT

And it isn't!

PAMELA

So they're real penguins?

WALT

No they're animated.

PAMELA

(SUDDEN REALIZATION)

Oh.

(to herself, smiling

RUEFULLY)

You foolish old woman.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Good day Mister Disney.

WALT

Pam! Pamela! Mrs Travers! Wait!

PAMELA

Please call my driver and have him

pick me up.

DOLLY

Yes ma'am, when?

PAMELA

NOW!

WALT

Please Mrs Travers-- You must

listen.

PAMELA

You shouldn't make promises you

can't keep, especially to children,

they hold on to them you see? And

those promises they just sit there

inside of them, like little doses

of poison, all those broken

promises, eating away forever.

WALT

Pamela? I don't understand why this

is so hard for you. Please, make me

UNDERSTAND--

PAMELA

The books weren't written for the

children. They were written for the

promise breakers.

WALT

The promise breakers? Mrs Travers I-

-

WALT (CONT'D)

Mrs Travers?

RALPH

Woah! Mister Disney!

WALT

Hi.

RALPH

Hi! I'm such a huge fan. It's such

an honour to--

RALPH (CONT'D)

(TO WALT)

Excuse me.

RALPH (CONT'D)

You ready to go Mrs?

PAMELA

Yes. Thank you.

WALT

PAMELA--

PAMELA

(TEARING UP)

I'm so sorry Mister Disney. To have

put everyone to so much trouble.

WALT

You must reconsider. You must.

PAMELA

I simply can't give her up. Not

yet. Perhaps not ever. I don't know

WHY

DISNEY

You do know why!

PAMELA

I can't, he's--

DISNEY

He's?

PAMELA

I just-- Goodbye Mr Disney.

RALPH

The lady's ready to go now sir.

WALT

He's?

RALPH

It's been a pleasure driving you

Mrs.

PAMELA

No one likes a fibber.

RALPH

(CHUCKLES)

I really have enjoyed it. Didn't

know who you were at first and then

guess what?

PAMELA

You found out?

RALPH

I was telling my daughter all about

my day and how I was driving this

nice writer lady, Mrs Travers for

Mr Disney and--

PAMELA

AND--

RALPH

AND--

(he leans into the

PASSENGER WINDOW)

And she makes me go to her bedroom

and get this!

(he pulls out a Mary

POPPINS BOOK)

Can't stop reading it. I'm very

slow mind you.

PAMELA

Would you like me to sign it?

RALPH

(DELIGHTED)

Would you?!

PAMELA

I'd be honoured.

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Your daughters name?

RALPH

Jane.

PAMELA

Really?

RALPH

Uh huh. Like the girl in the book.

PAMELA

(reading as she writes)

To Jane and her dearest father--

(she looks at him)

I've just this instant realized I

don't know your name.

RALPH

Ralph.

PAMELA

Pamela.

RALPH

Pamela.

PAMELA

You're the only American I have

ever liked, Ralph.

RALPH

May I ask why?

PAMELA

No. Now take this--

RALPH

(READING)

Albert Einstein, Van Gogh,

Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo--

(BEAT)

What is this?

PAMELA

They all had difficulties. Jane can

do anything that anyone else can

do, do you understand?

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Look at the bottom.

RALPH

Walt Disney!

PAMELA

Deficiencies in concentration and

hyperactive behavior. Explains

everything!

RALPH

Thank you Mrs.

WALT

She's gone?

TOMMIE

Flight left 10 minutes ago.

WALT

(expecting to read her

NAME)

PAMELA TRA--

(BEAT)

Goff? Who's Helen Goff?

TOMMIE

Her. That's her real name.

DOLLY

Yuh, didn't you know? She's all

hoity toity. British this and

British that and she's really an

Aussie called Helen Goff. Stuck up--

WALT

Then who's Travers?

WALT (CONT'D)

(smiles to himself)

I've been talking to the wrong

person.

MARGARET

DADDY--

GINTY

I want to see my father.

MARGARET

No, you mustn't.

GINTY

I want to see him!

AUNT ELLIE

Let her go Margaret.

GINTY

I dropped the pears.

GINTY (CONT'D)

I'm sorry daddy.

GINTY (CONT'D)

You promised you would fix

everything.

PAMELA

Hello house.

PAMELA

Oh dear god!

WALT

It was one heck of a job getting a

seat on the very next flight, let

me tell you.

PAMELA

But, you always get what you want

eventually. Isn't that right

Walter?

WALT

How about you show me how to make

one of those nice English pots of

tea?

PAMELA

Milk. The milk goes in first.

WALT

I remember.

PAMELA

And whiskey. I'll have whiskey in

mine.

WALT

(SURPRISED)

Oh.

(BEAT)

Oh well, when in Rome!

PAMELA

You've come to change my mind. To

beat me into submission.

WALT

No, I've come because you misjudge

me.

PAMELA

How do I misjudge you?

WALT

You look at me and you see some

kind of Hollywood King Midas.

(MORE)

WALT (CONT'D)

You think I've built an empire and

that I want to use your Mary

Poppins as just another brick in my

kingdom. You think I see her with a

carpetbag full of greenbacks.

PAMELA

And don't you?

WALT

If that was all it was would I have

pursued an cranky, stubborn dame

like you for twenty years? I'd've

have saved myself an ulcer!

(BEAT)

No, you expected me to disappoint

you and so you made sure I did. You

see, I think life disappoints you,

Mrs Travers. I think it's done

that a lot. Maybe Mary Poppins is

the only person in your life who

hasn't.

PAMELA

Mary Poppins isn't real.

WALT

Oh, no, that's not true. She's real

as can be to my daughter's and to

thousands of other children--

adults too. She's been there as a

nighttime comfort to a heck of a

lot of people.

PAMELA

Well, Where is she when I need her?

Hm? I open the door to Mary Poppins

and who should be standing there

but Walt Disney!

WALT

Mrs Travers, I am so sorry. I hoped

this would be a magical experience

for you, for all of us. But I let

you down-- and in doing so, I've

broken a twenty year old promise to

my girls.

(BEAT)

I've been wracking my brains,

trying to figure out why this has

been so hard for you and I--

(BEAT)

You see, I have my own Mr Banks.

Mine had a moustache.

PAMELA

Ah! Not true then that Disney

created man in his own image?

WALT

But it is true that you created

yourself in someone else's yes?

WALT (CONT'D)

Ever been to Kansas City, Mrs

Travers? Do you know Missouri at

all?

PAMELA

Can't say I do and as I have no

plans to ever set foot on American

soil again I'm afraid I never will.

WALT

It's mighty cold there in the

winters. Bitter.

WALT (CONT'D)

(it pours out)

My dad, Elias Disney, he owned a

newspaper delivery route there.

Thousand papers. Twice daily.

Morning and evening edition. Elias,

he was a tough businessman. A save-

a-penny anywhere you can type of

fella so he wouldn't employ any

delivery boys, he just used me and

my big brother Roy. I was eight

then-- eight years old.

(BEAT)

Like I said, those winters were

harsh and old Elias didn't believe

in new shoes until the old ones

were worn right through so--

(BEAT)

Honestly, Mrs Travers, the snow

would be up to here--

WALT (CONT'D)

You'd push through it like wading

through molasses.

(MORE)

WALT (CONT'D)

And the cold and the wet would be

seeping through the shoes and the

skin would be raw and peeling from

our faces-- and sometimes I'd find

myself sunk down in the snow,

waking up, cuz I must've passed out

for a moment-- I dunno. Then

school, too cold to figure out an

equation. And back into the snow so

by the time we got home it'd be

just getting dark, and every part

of you would sting like crazy as it

slowly came back to life in the

warmth. My mother would feed us

dinner and then it'd be time to go

out again for the evening edition.

(BEAT)

Best be quick Walt, best be quick

or poppa's gonna show you the

buckle end again boy.

WALT (CONT'D)

Now, I don't tell you all this to

make you sad Mrs Travers, I don't.

I love my life - it's a miracle.

And I loved my daddy, boy I loved

him. But, there isn't a day goes by

where I don't think of that little

boy in the snow and old Elias with

his fist and strap and I'm just so

tired-- I'm tired of remembering it

that way. Aren't you tired Mrs

Travers? We all have our tales but

don't you want to find a way to

finish the story? Let it all go and

have a life that isn't dictated by

a past?

(BEAT)

It's not the children she comes to

save. It's their father.

(BEAT)

It's your father--?

(BEAT)

Travers Goff.

PAMELA

I don't know what you think you

know about me Walter--

WALT

You must've loved and admired him a

lot to take his name--

PAMELA

I--

WALT

Mrs. Travers. It's all about him

isn't it? All of this. Everything.

WALT (CONT'D)

Forgiveness. It's what I learned

from your books.

PAMELA

I don't need to forgive my father.

He was a wonderful man.

WALT

No, you need to forgive Helen Goff.

Life is a harsh sentence to lay

down for yourself.

WALT (CONT'D)

Give her to me, Mrs Travers. Trust

me with your precious Mary Poppins.

I won't disappoint you. I swear

that every time a person goes into

a movie house - from Leicester to

St Louis, they will see George

Banks being saved. They will love

him and his kids, they will weep

for his cares, and wring their

hands when he loses his job. And

when he flies that kite, oh! They

will rejoice, they will sing. In

every movie house, all over the

world, in the eyes and the hearts

of my kids, and other kids and

their mothers and fathers for

generations to come, George Banks

will be honoured. George Banks will

be redeemed. George Banks and all

he stands for will be saved.

Maybe not in life, but in

imagination. Because that's what we

storytellers do. We restore order

with imagination. We instill hope

again and again and again. Trust

me, Mrs Travers. Let me prove it to

you. I give you my word.

PAMELA

Enough.

TOMMIE

Walt.

TOMMIE (CONT'D)

Invitation list for the premiere.

WALT

Is that everyone?

TOMMIE

Not everyone.

WALT

(SIGHS)

We'll premiere in London as well.

It'll be more convenient for her.

WALT (CONT'D)

There'll be cameras, press,

interviews-- I have to protect the

picture.

TOMMIE

Okay.

OMITTED

PAMELA

I should say so too.

POLLY (O.S.)

Mrs Travers!

POLLY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Mrs Travers!

PAMELA

For goodness sake!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

Please don't screech like an

alleycat!

DIARMUID

I am so pleased to hear that Mrs

Travers.

PAMELA

I should think you'll have a draft

very soon.

(CALLING OUT)

Polly! Where's that tea?

(TO DIARMUID)

It's coming along marvelously!

PAMELA (CONT'D)

(TO POLLY)

Would you pour please?

POLLY

You're perfectly capable of doing

it yourself.

PAMELA

She's quite the worst maid I've

ever had!

DIARMUID

So why do you keep her?

PAMELA

I don't know-- she reminds me of

me.

DIARMUID

Do you have a title?

PAMELA

Mary Poppins in the Kitchen.

DIARMUID

Wonderful. Should we start talking

about the film rights?

PAMELA

NEVER again.

DIARMUID

Okay.

(BEAT)

Now, tell me, Have you got your

tiara for the premiere?

PAMELA

Oh, I'm not going.

DIARMUID

Why not?

PAMELA

Hollywood premieres are not for old

trout like me. Anyway, it's not

CONVENIENT--

DIARMUID

He hasn't invited you, has he?

DIARMUID (CONT'D)

Mary Poppins wouldn't stand for

that.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Can I help you?

PAMELA

I'm perfectly capable thank you.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Suit yourself-- ma'am.

PAMELA

(CHEERY)

I shall!

CAPTAIN (O.S.)

Ladies and gentlemen, good

afternoon and welcome aboard this

flight to Los Angeles. Just a few

announcements before we begin our

taxi for takeoff--

WALT

Morning Dolly.

APPROACHING--

TOMMIE'S DESK

WALT (CONT'D)

What?

PAMELA

Me again!

WALT

Mrs Travers! How wonderful to see

you. What brings you to--

PAMELA

I'm here for my premiere.

WALT

Great!

PAMELA

I didn't receive my invitation, but

I just assumed the American postal

service had fallen down on the job

as per usual.

WALT

I'll have a-- uh, replacement sent

to your hotel right away.

PAMELA

That's very kind, Mr Disney. I knew

you wouldn't have forgotten me.

WALT

Pam, how could I?

PAMELA

How indeed? You did, after all,

assure me that I wouldn't be

disappointed.

PAMELA

(TO MICKEY)

I thought I left you in London.

PAMELA

(TO DOORMAN)

Would you call me a taxi please?

DOORMAN

Absolutely.

RALPH

Had a feeling a certain friend of

mine might be needing me tonight.

PAMELA

Ralph!

RALPH

You look like a million bucks!

Let's get you to the ball.

RALPH

(in her ear)

This is your night. None of this

would be possible without you.

BERT

You know, begging your pardon, but

the one my heart goes out to is

your father.

BERT (CONT'D)

There he is in that cold, heartless

bank day after day, hemmed in by

mounds of cold, heartless

money.

BERT (CONT'D)

I don't like to see any living

thing caged up.

JANE

Father in a cage?

BERT

They makes cages in all sizes and

shapes, you know.

BERT (CONT'D)

Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets

and all.

DISSOLVE TO:

MICHEAL

You won't ever leave us will you?

JANE

Whatever would we do without you?

MARY POPPINS

I shall stay until the wind

changes.

WALT

It's all right, Mrs Travers. It's

alright. Mr Banks is going to be

all right. I promise.

PAMELA

No, no. It's just that-- I can't, I

can't abide cartoons!

TRAVERS (V.O.)

Never. I promise. I will never lose

you.

DISSOLVE TO:

TRAVERS (V.O.)
