THEN CUT TO:

JAKE

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

It's a thrill to be standing here

talking to you wonderful people. In

fact, it's a thrill to be standing!

I haven't seen so many people since

my last fight at Madison Square

Garden. After that fight, a

reporter asked me, 'Jake, where do

you go from here?' I said, 'To a

hospital!' I fought one hundred and

six professional fights and still

none of them bums figured out how

to fight me -- they kept hitting me

in the head! And that's why I'm

here tonight...

(starts to sing)

'When the fighter's not engaged in

his employment, his employment,

although he was Champ and quite the

rage, he must go somewhere else to

seek employment, seek employment.

But a fighter's life is not a bowl

of cherries, still I'd rather have

an egg than a fist upon my face...

That's Entertainment!'

JOEY

You didn't have to come to

Cleveland to get beat by a "moulan

yan," Jake!

TONY

He's got you, Jake! You're

outpointed! You're coming up for

the tenth. You gotta knock him out!

JOEY

A grand apiece! We got a grand

apiece on this, Jake! A fucking

grand!

REFEREE

One, two, three, four...

ANNOUNCER

Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner,

under the rules of the Cleveland

Boxing Commission, after ten

rounds, by a decision -- Jimmy

Reeves.

JOEY

(to Jake)

Don't get out of the ring. You won

the fight -- let him go out first.

CUT TO:

JOEY

Salvy, would I steer you wrong?

Let's say that's the truck; it's

full of cigarettes, right? Now, two

o'clock this morning we move the

truck from here to there,

(he points; the CAMERA

PANS)

take the cigarettes out, sell 'em,

make some cash.

SALVY

Hey but Joey, you're thinking

nickels and dimes. The money's with

your brother.

JOEY

What do you want from my life,

Salvy? He's my brother.

SALVY

He ain't doin' the right thing.

He's makin' beans compared to what

he should be makin'. Can't you make

him understand that?

JOEY

(to cop)

Hey, leave the kids alone.

SALVY

Get lost.

(joking, he knows the Cop)

Hey kids, "A cop is a rat."

Remember that, "A rat."

JOEY

(to Cop)

Hey Jimmy, here's a dollar for your

trouble. There's some bums around

the corner -- they need your help.

COP

Keep the dollar, Joey. Get yourself

a new suit.

JOEY

(laughs)

Here's my new suit.

(grabs his crotch)

Right here.

COP

Hey, don't get wise!

JOEY

Just kidding, take it easy.

(to himself)

No fuckin' sense of humor.

JAKE

This looks done.

IRMA

It's not done.

JAKE

It looks done. I'll take it the way

it is.

IRMA

Here's your steak. You can't wait

for it to be done. Here.

IRMA (CONT'D)

Here's your carrots. You're in such

a hurry. You can't wait.

JAKE

No, I can't wait. You know when I

wait? When it's important to wait.

It's not important to wait for no

steak. It's important to wait for

Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't

important to wait for no steak! I

won that fight. So, I stayed in the

ring, and that way I made sure

everybody knew it. I shoulda

knocked him out earlier,

sonofabitch.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Wait! I'll wait. But let me tell

you, if this steak was the

middleweight championship, I'd show

you how I'd wait. I'd eat it raw.

I'd drink the blood. I'd eat it

before it came out of the cow --

that's how I'd wait.

JOEY

I can't convince him. He's got such

a thick head, I'd like to crack it

open myself. Believe me, my own

brother. It's very hard. You don't

have to convince me -- I know we

should be with Tommy. You talk to

him. He don't listen to nobody.

SALVY

Look, I'm just tellin' you how

Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard

on himself. Tommy wants him with

us. It's as simple as that.

SALVY (CONT'D)

Talk some sense into him, will ya?

You're still his brother.

If he ain't gonna listen to you, he

ain't gonna listen to nobody!

JOEY

All right, I'll try. See you later.

SALVY

Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.

JOEY

Right, the gym.

JOEY

(noticing Jake)

What's the matter?

IRMA

He's doing it again.

JOEY

(goes to Jake)

What's the matter? You're drinking.

You're eating like an animal.

JOEY (CONT'D)

What's wrong?

JAKE

(gets up)

Nothing...

JOEY

Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?

JAKE

(privately, to Joey)

I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis,

that's what's the matter.

JOEY

What're you talking about? He's a

heavyweight. You're a middleweight.

JAKE

Look at these hands. These fuckin'

hands. I was born with a girl's

hands. And even if I put on enough

weight to be a heavyweight, I'd be

too slow to fight. No matter how

big I get, I'll never be big enough

to fight Louis.

JOEY

That's what I'm sayin'. You

shouldn't even think like that.

It's crazy.

JAKE

I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll

never be big enough to fight Louis,

but I know Joey, I know...

JOEY

You know?

JAKE

Yeah. Do me a favor.

JOEY

Sure. What is it?

JAKE

Hit me in the face.

JOEY

(after a pause)

You want me to do what?

JAKE

You heard me, I said hit me.

JOEY

C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.

JAKE

Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your

best shot. On the jaw.

JOEY

Jack, I got no gloves.

JAKE

(grabs a nearby towel)

Here's your glove.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Go ahead. Hit me. C'mon, don't

worry about it. I want you to hit

me with everything you got.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Again. Harder.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Harder. Go 'head.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Harder.

(grabs the towel)

Take the towel off.

JOEY

Jack! Enough!

JAKE

Go ahead.

JOEY

What was that for? I know you can

take punches. I can hit you from

now to doomsday. What the fuck does

that prove?

JAKE

See that, I don't feel it. I can

take it. I know I can take anybody.

SALVY

(waves)

Hey Joey --

SALVY (CONT'D)

(waves again)

Jake, how you doin'?

JAKE

Did you know they were coming up

here?

JAKE (CONT'D)

Answer me when I talk to you.

JOEY

Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to

talk to you. So I...

JAKE

(interrupting)

Don't ever bring those kids up here

again! I'm working out, I'm killin'

myself in here, and they walk

around like they fuckin' own the

neighborhood.

SALVY

(to Joey)

Hey Joey, we better go. See you

later.

JAKE

Go 'head. Wave goodbye. They're

your friends.

JAKE (CONT'D)

And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he

think he is? I'm gonna let that

fuckin' hard-on come up here and

act like a big shot.

JOEY

What are you getting so hot about --

Tommy Como told him to come down

here...

JAKE

(interrupting)

Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como.

I don't care about Jesus Christ on

the fuckin' cross. I gotta give

them a percentage of what I make!

I'm in here breaking my ass, not

them. Don't ever bring them up here

again.

JOEY

I didn't tell them to come. Tommy

Como...

JAKE

That's right, fight back. I got

laid three times before I came up

here this morning and I can still

break your ass.

JOEY

You cocksucker.

FAN

Hey, Jake.

JAKE

(referring to Vickie)

Who's that?

JOEY

Whadda you care?

JAKE

Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who

is she? What's a matter? You afraid

I'm gonna take her on you?

JOEY

No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna

meet her?

JAKE

Yeah --

JOEY

Cause I'll go right over there and

bring her here.

JAKE

Go 'head.

JOEY

You sure you wanna meet her? Don't

make me go over there, you change

your mind and you make me look bad,

cause she's really a knockout.

She's 15, this kid -- a great piece

of ass.

JAKE

How do you know? You know her that

good?

JOEY

No, I see her around the pool. I

know her. I know her like that --

not like that.

JAKE

(gesturing to his bandage)

Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I

don't feel right...

JOEY

(to Jake)

I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I

know she'll be there.

JAKE

'Cause I wanna catch her alone.

JOEY

How you gonna catch anybody alone

at a dance?... I don't know if

she'll be there alone... She'll

probably be there with her

girlfriends or something.

JAKE

She ever go with them? Like Salvy?

JOEY

Nah, she don't go with nobody.

She's only 15 years old.

JAKE

What does that have to do with it?

She don't look 15 to me. I heard

somethin' with Salvy. She was with

him once or somethin', I think. It

was like some blonde. That's the

one...

JOEY

Probably. You know she talks to

everybody, and not just him.

JAKE

Yeah, she's nice.

JOEY

Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin'

you.

JAKE

You wasn't with her, were you?

JOEY

Huh?

JAKE

You wasn't with her?

JOEY

With her? How?

JAKE

You know, like bang her or

anything?

JOEY

Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I

know her from around here, that's

all. You want to meet her or what?

JAKE

Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons

around. I'll wait. Not now.

JOEY

(to Jake)

I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I

know she'll be there. Dressed up

and everything.

JAKE

I don't like all those other clowns

around. That's all I know.

JOEY

C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna

get outa here tonight.

IRMA

Where you going at this hour?

JAKE

What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out --

business.

IRMA

You fuckin' worm, if you're going

out, I'm going out.

JAKE

And where you goin'?

IRMA

None of your fuckin' business.

JAKE

Eh, go out. Do what you're gonna

do. What do I care?

IRMA

That's right -- run out. I ain't

gonna be here when you get back.

IRMA

Bunch of guys. You all hang out

together. Yeah, you're all going

out on business. You're all gonna

suck each other off.

JOEY

What a mouth on her -- you shoulda

hit her -- no good fuckin' Jewish

cunt -- breakin' our balls. You

shoulda hit her with a chair.

JAKE

Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk

like that. She's still my wife.

JOEY

No, but Jake... how much abuse can

you take.

JAKE

(interrupting)

How many times do I have to hit

her? I hit her enough.

IRMA

Go ahead -- that's all you're good

for -- to go out and leave me here

like a dog. You and your brother!

You don't even look like brothers.

You look like faggots! That's what

you look like -- faggots!

JOEY

Look, could you move a little.

Would you mind, darling?

VERA

Mind what, Mr. Big Shot?

JAKE

(annoyed)

Eh, girlie, take a walk.

JOEY

(to Vera)

All right, darling, I'll just stand

here and wait.

JAKE

Do you see her yet?

JOEY

Give me a chance. Let me look.

JOEY (CONT'D)

THERE she is over there on the

other side. What did I tell you?

Oh, ain't she nice? Ain't she a

fuckin' doll?

JAKE

Be right back.

JOEY

(calling out to Vickie)

Hey, Vickie, c'mere. Don't be

afraid. C'mere. Just say hello.

This is my brother.

JOEY (CONT'D)

Vickie, I want you to meet my

brother, Jake. He's gonna be the

next champ.

JAKE

Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is

that right? You wanted to meet me?

VICKIE

(to Joey)

I just wanted to say hello.

JAKE

You wanted to say hello, eh? I

can't believe it. When did you fall

outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you

you're the most beautiful one here,

princess of the pool. You got a

baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha

wanna meet me for?

VICKIE

I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.

JAKE

(to Joey)

Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face

is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now?

You wanna go for a ride?

VICKIE

Sure. Gimme a few minutes.

JAKE

Hey...

VICKIE

You don't talk very much.

JAKE

I ain't ever talked to a movie star

before.

VICKIE

(giggles)

I ain't no movie star. I'm just in

high school.

JAKE

Oh no? I thought you was a movie

star.

VICKIE

Jake! The bus!

JAKE

Any bus gives you trouble, I knock

it out for ya.

VICKIE

You go first. Let me watch how to

do this.

JAKE

You don't get nothin' done by

watchin'. You just gotta do it.

Here, I'll help you.

JAKE (CONT'D)

That's it. Just grip up a little

tighter. That's it. You're gonna be

real good at this. How does that

feel?

VICKIE

It feels real good.

JAKE

Just keep your eye on the ball.

VICKIE

Should I hit it?

JAKE

Just give it a nice little tap.

VICKIE

I can't find my ball.

JAKE

Can you see it?

VICKIE

No.

VICKIE (CONT'D)

Can you see it?

JAKE

No.

VICKIE

What does that mean?

JAKE

It means the game is over.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Let's get outa here.

JAKE

Hi Pop. This is my new girlfriend,

Vickie. V for victory. How do you

like that Pop?

JOE LAMOTTA

V for victory.

VICKIE

(nervous)

It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr.

LaMotta.

JOE LAMOTTA

(in Italian)

Sit down. Eat something.

JAKE

C'mon, Pop. You've been in America

so many years. Speak English.

JOE LAMOTTA

(joking)

You want me to speak English --

Fuck you. That's English.

JAKE

Pop, don't curse. There's a girl

here. I'm gonna show her around the

house. Why don't you just finish

your wine?

VICKIE

Jake, this is your father's

bedroom.

JAKE

That's all right. He don't mind.

VICKIE

Jake...

JAKE

It's OK.

JOEY

The fuckin' papers are full of

Robinson and nothing on Jake -- and

Jake knocked him clear outa the

ring in Detroit. He's the only guy

ever to beat Robinson. Whatsa

matter with you? I thought we had

an arrangement.

REPORTER

We do Joey. You know we do.

JOEY

You holding me up for more cash or

what?

REPORTER

I can't print nothing if Jake won't

give me nothing.

JOEY

C'mon, Jake. You're makin' us look

stupid. I brought these guys up

here, now you don't wanna talk to

them? What are ya doin'? Open your

mouth, for Christsake.

JAKE

(interrupting)

I'm tallin' you now, when I read

this, it better not make me look

bad.

REPORTER

Jake, did I ever make you look bad

before?

JAKE

Maybe it wasn't you, but you know

what I'm talkin' about.

JOEY

(interrupting)

Don't worry. Don't worry. It's

gonna be all right.

(to reporter)

Ask him your questions.

REPORTER

All right, Jake, you're being

talked about as the top

middleweight contender. Do you

think another victory over Sugar

Ray will get you a shot at the

title?

JAKE

Why not? There's nobody else around

who wants to fight me; they're all

afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't

have a shot at the title right now.

REPORTER

Well, the word is to get a title

shot you have to cooperate with the

people who control boxing, in New

York. And they're saying that you

don't cooperate.

JAKE

You guys know more about that than

I do. I just fight...

JOEY

(interrupting)

He fights the toughest guys around

that everybody else is afraid to

fight...

JAKE

(interrupting)

I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar

Ray, and I still don't have a shot

at the title.

REPORTER

You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks

ago and you're training like this

right now... Are you afraid Sugar

Ray might beat you this time?

JAKE

I tell you what. You hit me here.

(points to his right

cheek)

Sugar Ray hits me here.

(points to his left cheek)

I can't tell the difference. I just

fight.

VICKIE

Are you sure we should be doing

this?

JAKE

Come over here.

VICKIE

You said never to touch you before

a fight.

JAKE

(lovingly)

If you let me do it, I'll murder

you. Come here.

VICKIE

You said I couldn't. You've been

good for two weeks...

JAKE

Come here.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Take off my pants.

VICKIE

Jake...

JAKE

Do what I say.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Now take the rest off.

VICKIE

Jake, you made me promise not to

get you excited.

JAKE

Go 'head. Do it.

VICKIE

I like the gym smell.

JAKE

Now take your panties off.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Now, touch me...

(takes her hand)

... here.

VICKIE

Oh, Jake.

JAKE

I can't do it. I can't fool around.

This Robinson, I gotta beat him

again. I can't fool around. Don't

come near me.

JOEY

(angry)

They robbed us! Those fuckin'

judges -- What the fuck fight were

they watching? If I see them on the

street, I'll break their heads.

Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass!

Those judges give him the decision

'cause he's goin in the army next

week! How else could this have

happened?... What do you think they

gave him the decision for, that's

why.

JAKE

(almost to himself)

Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked

him down. What did I do wrong? I

don't understand.

JOEY

You won and was robbed! You didn't

do nothin' wrong.

JAKE

I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to

win. I've done a lot of bad things.

I dunno...

JOYE

Fuck that. This was the fight. This

coulda done it. This was our shot.

They out and out robbed us.

MARIO

Vickie is here, Jake.

JAKE

I don't wanna see nobody.

JOEY

You want us to wait for you?

JAKE

No, take her home. I wanna be alone

for a while. Everybody go.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JAKE

(to Joey as he turns down

the radio)

I just weighed myself - I'm 161. No

more deals like this Janiro

bullshit. I didn't tell you to do

it in the first place.

JOEY

Jake, you're the one who said you

could get down to 155! What did I

do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?

JAKE

(angry)

Well, sometimes you shouldn't

listen to me! Now I don't know if I

can make it down to 155. I'm having

trouble making 160, and without

telling me, you sign me for a fight

at 155 pounds, and if I don't make

155, I forfeit $15,000! You're

supposed to know what you're doin'.

You're supposed to be a manager!

JOEY

You want the title shot?

JAKE

Say what you're gonna say.

JOEY

You want the title shot or not?

JAKE

Say what you gotta say. Don't be a

smart ass.

JOEY

(yelling)

This Janiro's an up-and-coming

fighter, this kid you gotta knock

out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm

telling you, this is your step

towards getting a shot at the

title. Listen to me: I'm telling

you. You been killin' yourself for

three years. There's nobody left --

they're afraid to fight you.

This Janiro's up-and-coming. He

don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart,

wipe him out! What are you worried

about? Your weight? Look, even if

you lose they're gonna think you're

weak; they're gonna think you're

not the fighter you used to be.

They'll match you with guys they

were afraid to match you with

before, and then you'll kill them

and you'll get your title shot. And

if you beat this kid Janiro, they

gotta give you a shot at the title

because there's nobody else. Either

way you win and you do it on your

own -- just like you want it. All

right?

VICKIE

Joey's right. Janiro's up-and

coming, he's good looking...

JAKE

(interrupting)

What do you mean, "good looking?"

VICKIE

Well, he's popular. A lotta people

like Janiro. You beat him and it

only figures they'll wanna see you

get a title shot. But, what do I

know? I should keep my mouth shut,

I should...

JAKE

(interrupting)

Who asked you?

VICKIE

But, Jake, I was just...

JAKE

(interrupting)

Who asked you?

VICKIE

I was just...

JAKE

(interrupting)

Who asked you?

JAKE (CONT'D)

(turns to Joey)

All right, manager. Everybody had

their say around here. Now this is

what I'm gonna say. I'm gonna get

down to 155, and I'm gonna destroy

this kid -- get my title shot. And

don't ever bet 15 thousand without

my sayso again.

COMEDIAN

Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to

point out a special guest we have

with us tonight -- The Raging Bull,

The Bronx Bull, Mr. Jake LaMotta.

COMEDIAN (CONT'D)

Stand up, Jake, c'mon. Oh, you are

standing. Sorry.

(laughs)

Just kiddin', Jake.

JAKE

(to Joey)

Look at this abuse I gotta take.

JAKE (CONT'D)

(joking)

What's so funny?

(lifting his glass)

Cheers! Post-time. Joey, Vickie,

and...

(to Janet)

What's your name again, darling?

JANET

Janet.

SALVY

Hi, Joey. Jake, how you doin'?

Vickie...

JAKE

What're you lookin' at? You lookin'

at him?

VICKIE

No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.

JAKE

Don't tell me "No." I saw you

lookin' at him. Why, you like him?

VICKIE

I'm not interested in him.

JAKE

You're not interested in him?

VICKIE

No, I'm not.

JAKE

In other words, you're not

interested in him but you'd be

interested in somebody else, right?

VICKIE

Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.

JAKE

(turns to Joey, referring

to Salvy)

Look at this, all of a sudden

everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around

here. Did you see the way she was

lookin' at him?

JOEY

Nah, she would never...

JAKE

(interrupting)

Didn't you just see her lookin' at

him? She told me no, but I don't

believe her.

JOEY

(uncomfortable)

C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy

about you.

JAKE

I'd just love to catch her. Oooooh,

I'd just love to catch her once.

WAITER

These are from Tommy Como.

JOEY

(to Jake)

Excuse me for a minute. Be right

back.

JAKE

(sarcastic)

Don't be long. I'm afraid with all

these tough guys here.

JOEY

Jake, come over for a few minutes.

Tommy wants to say hello to you.

C'mon, just come and say hello.

JAKE

Hi, Tommy. How are you?

TOMMY

Jake, sit down for a minute.

TOMMY (CONT'D)

(his arm around Jake)

Fuckin' kid! You're the best

fuckin' fighter around. Loved what

you did to Satterfield. Them

"moulan yans" -- forget about it.

They're all afraid to fight you.

JAKE

(a little embarrassed)

C'mon, Tommy --

TOMMY

How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin'

good?

JAKE

Never felt better.

TOMMY

Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?

JAKE

He should.

TOMMY

(to Salvy)

This Janiro's a good fiahter,

pretty good-lookin' kid.

SALVY

Bet on him three times. Always come

through for me.

TOMMY

How's the weight? Ok?

JAKE

Yeah, the weight's Ok.

TOMMY

All right, lemme ask you something.

Let's say I was a good friend of

yours. And I was telling you I was

gonna bet a lot of money on you in

this Janiro fight. What would you

tell me?

JAKE

I'd tell you to bet a bundle.

JAKE

Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?

VICKIE

What?

JAKE

You asleep?

VICKIE

Yeah.

JAKE

Huh?

VICKIE

Yeah, what?

JAKE

Tell me, you think of anybody else

when I'm making love to you?

VICKIE

Nobody. I love you, remember?

JAKE

Then why'd you say that thing about

Tony Janiro?

VICKIE

What did I say?

JAKE

That he's got a pretty face.

VICKIE

I never noticed his face.

JAKE

You sure you're not thinking of him

right now?

VICKIE

Positive.

JAKE

You're the one who said he was good

looking. You think he's good

looking 'cause I know you think

he's good-looking. I'll smash his

face inside out. I'll make him into

dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's

good-looking when I get through

with him. So you just go ahead and

think about who you want.

EAGAN

Tony Janiro, 151 lbs. and one half.

EAGAN (CONT'D)

Jake LaMotta, 155 lbs. and one

fourth.

JAKE

Just a minute.

EAGAN

Ok. This is official.

EAGAN (CONT'D)

LaMotta, 155 lbs. on the nose.

CROWD

LaMotta.

ANNOUNCER

The winner, by unanimous decision,

in ten rounds, Jake LaMotta!

JOEY

I love you.

JAKE

(shouts to Vickie)

This is my night! Listen to them!

I'm gonna be champ!

JAKE (CONT'D)

I'm making everything up to you.

DETROIT PROMOTER

When we gonna get Jake back in

Detroit? Jesus, he really did a job

on Janiro. Who you after next,

Joey?

JOEY

(evasive)

I dunno. We're working on it. He's

training at the camp now.

JACKIE CURTIE

After what I seen, they gotta give

him a shot at the title.

JOEY

We're gonna get our shot.

DETROIT PROMOTER

Oh Joey, this is Jackie Curtie. He

handles a lot of business in South

Ohio.

JACKIE CURTIE

I like your brother. Made a lot of

money on him.

JOEY

Betcha more than he has.

JACKIE CURTIE

Made a little cabbage on the Tommy

Bell fight too. Whatever happened

to him?

JOEY

Ain't he dead?

DETROIT PROMOTER

Nah. He's got a job downtown. Runs

an elevator in some building.

JOEY

Yeah?

DETROIT PROMOTER

Went down to see him the other day.

I says, "Tommy, take me up to the

fifth floor." And you know, he took

me right up there.

JACKIE CURTIE

Yeah, Tommy always was a stand-up

guy.

DETROIT PROMOTER

Joey, let me get you another drink.

JOEY

(distracted)

Just a minute. Excuse me. I'll be

right back.

JOEY (CONT'D)

(to Vickie)

C'mere, let me talk to you for a

minute.

JOEY (CONT'D)

What're you doin' with Salvy? You

shouldn't be here with him. Jake's

away killin' himself. Suppose he

found out.

VICKIE

What the hell am I doing wrong?

Just because Jake is training, I

can't go out? What am I, a goddamn

prisoner?

JOEY

No, you're his wife.

VICKIE

I'm not doing anythina wrong. I'm

just trying to have a good time. Do

I have to be cooped up in the house

all the time?

JOEY

It don't look right.

VICKIE

Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's

gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter

of time.

JOEY

I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but

if he finds out, he will kill you.

What's the matter with you? Aren't

you happy? You got everything you

want.

VICKIE

You don't sleep with him. I do. I

don't get to breathe without

tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage.

If he thinks I'm lookin' at

somebody the wrong way, I get used

as a punching bag. He don't trust

nobody. If he saw the two of us

talking together right now, you'd

be in trouble too -- believe me.

Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old.

I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake,

but you don't know. He gets crazy

sometimes. I'm scared.

JOEY

Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's

got a lotta aggravation. He's been

a top contender too long.

VICKIE

That's right, take his part. You're

his brother. He's never gonna be

champ. Too many people are against

him.

JOEY

And you're drinking with them right

now.

VICKIE

And I'm gonna finish my drink. And,

I'm gonna have a good time, because

I ain't doing nothing wrong.

JOEY

(grabbing her)

You're wrong to be here. Let's go.

JOEY (CONT'D)

I said, let's go.

SALVY

Joey, relax. You're taking this the

wrong way. Why don't you sit down

and have a drink?

JOEY

Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister

in-law.

SALVY

Excuse me for living.

JOEY

What do you think, I'm blind? My

brother's breaking his ass in a

ring, and you're here with his

wife.

SALVY

Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and

Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just

happened to come along. We're just

trying to have a good time. What do

you want from me? So, why don't you

just take it easy before this gets

out of hand.

JOEY

Get the fuck outa here. What did

you do, take your gangster pills

today? I'll tear your fuckin' head

off your shoulders!

JOEY (CONT'D)

Hey, wait --

PAUL

Ain't you forgettin' something?

Ain't there never supposed to be no

trouble in this joint?

SALVY

Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die

young?

JOEY

(as he turns and lashes

into Salvy and Patsy)

I'll suck your eyes out! I'll

fuckin' take the two of you.

JOEY (CONT'D)

Fuckin' low-life, cocksucker, etc.

...

PATSY

(to Paul)

Don't fuckin' put your hands on me!

You're gonna near about this, Paul.

PAUL

(to Patsy)

Get the fuck outa here. Don't come

in my place and start fuckin'

trouble -- I don't care who you

are!

(to Joey)

Get outa here. Go on.

COMO

All rightg I don't have to hear any

more. I think I understand what

happened. I understand it was your

brother's wife and there was

probably a misunderstanding. I'm

not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have

acted the way he did. But, Joey,

you don't raise your hands. You

don't do that kind of thing. This

time we forget about it but no more

after this. You understand?

JOEY

Yeah, I understand, Tommy.

COMO

All right, you guys, shake hands.

COMO (CONT'D)

Go 'head. Be friends. That's it.

(to Salvy and Patsy)

All right, lemme be alone with him

for a minute.

COMO (CONT'D)

Aside from everything else, your

family all right?

JOEY

Yeah, they're good. They're good,

Tommy.

COMO

What is it with you? Can't you

talk? You got like a funny

attitude. I can't figure you out,

Joey. What's with you and the quick

answers? You wanna get outa here

fast?

JOEY

Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.

COMO

Look Joey, I wanna tell you

something.

Your brother ain't gonna get

nowhere without us -- nowhere. And

I'm tellin' you between the two of

us, it's gettin' to the point where

it's gettin' to be a real

embarrassment to me, a real

embarrassment.

JOEY

How can he embarrass you?

COMO

He's an embarrassment because

Frankie and the other guys are

expectin' me to do something about

it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I

can't deliver a kid from my own

neighborhood. Why's he make it so

hard on himself? He comes to me, I

can make it easier for him.

JOEY

Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't

even say hello to anybody else --

you know that. But you know when

Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus

Christ Almighty could get off the

fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna

talk him out of it. I'm his kid

brother. I got no say with Jake on

this. He thinks he can buck

everybody and make it on his own.

COMO

Make it on his own? Does he know

the kind of money involved? I mean

the real money. He thinks he's

gonna become champ on his own?

We're gonna sit by and see some nut

come in there and hold one of the

most important titles in the world?

A nut who don't listen to nobody or

respect nobody? Is he really crazy?

Listen, Joey, you understand, you

tell him. I don't care how great he

is or how colorful. He could beat

all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all

the Janiros he wants to. He ain't

gonna get a shot at the title

without us. I'm not askin' you to

do another thing except get that

message into that thick head!

JOEY

Whatcha doin'?

JAKE

I remember the first time I met

Vickie... I know there's somethin'

up. I know she's doin' somethin',

but I can't catch her...

JOEY

Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit

her so she can't talk to you the

way she wants to.

JAKE

What do you mean?

JOEY

Try talkin' to her. She's your wife

-- ask her what's the matter.

JAKE

When I'm away, did you ever notice

anythin' funny with her? Tell me

the truth.

JOEY

Jack, if there was anything funny,

I would tell you.

JAKE

I want you to keep an eye on her

when I'm not here. Understand?

JOEY

Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.

JAKE

What did Tommy say?

JOEY

I got good news, and I got bad

news. The good news is you got your

shot at the title. The bad news

is...

JAKE

(interrupting, resigned)

Yeah, I know.

EAGAN

Billy Fox, 173 3/4 pounds.

EAGAN (CONT'D)

Jake LaMotta, 167 pounds.

JAKE

What's up, Colonel?

EAGAN

I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.

JOEY

Sure.

EAGAN

I suppose you heard what

everybody's been saying, Jake.

JAKE

What who's been sayin'?

EAGAN

You were a big favorite in this

fight. Then two days ago the odds

start jumping all over the place

until you're a 12-5 underdog.

JAKE

I don't follow no gamblin'

Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.

EAGAN

Now the fight's off the books

altogether.

Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet

down on this fight. Some people are

saying you're going into the tank.

JAKE

Believe what you want.

EAGAN

I want to believe you, LaMotta.

JAKE

I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin'

jig's gonna wish he never came outa

the jungle. You got any money?

EACAN

What?

JAKE

You got any money you want to bet

on Billy Fox, you can put it right

here...

(extends his hand)

'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down

for nobody.

EAGAN

That's all I wanted to hear.

JAKE

(to Fox)

Stand up! What the fuck are you

doin'?

CROWD

Got your swimming trunks on, Jake?

I hope they're paying you enough.

Fake, fake.

TIME CUT:

TONY

What's the matter with you? What's

the matter with you?

TIME CUT:

JAKE

Hit me! Hit me! What's the matter

with you, you motherfucker? Hit me!

TONY

Don't fight anymore!

(pause)

It's a free country, don't fight

anymore!

JAKE

(between sobs)

Why did they have to stop it? Why

did they have to stop it?

REPORTER

What happened?

HANDLER

(quietly)

He must've been really hurt in the

2nd. He didn't answer me when I

tried to tell him something in the

corner.

JAKE

Get everyone out of here!

JOEY

(yelling)

It woulda been so easy, Jack. So

easy...

JOEY (CONT'D)

Stick out your hands, Jake.

JAKE

C'mon, Joey.

JOEY

G'wan, do it.

(jabs at him)

Protect yourself, rummy.

JOEY (CONT'D)

See? That's all there was to it.

JAKE

What the fuck they want? I took the

dive. They want me to fall down

too? I don't fall down for nobody.

I never went down in my life. Joey,

what do I gotta do?

Crawl on my hands and knees? I made

an asshole of myself in the fuckin'

Garden! All the newspaper writers

make fun of me. I'm the bum of the

year. All I want is a shot. Just a

fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do?

I'll do anything.

JOEY

Except fall down like a normal

person.

JAKE

Yeah, except fall down. That's

right.

JOEY

All right, you don't wanna fall

down, so now you gotta take a rest.

So, you enjoy the suspension.

'Cause there's nothin' you can do

about it. Let the Commissioner and

the D.A. jerk you around. So you

wait.

JAKE

Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am

I gonna do for seven months? I'm

gonna go crazy. How do I keep my

strength? By that time I'll be too

weak to win the title. And my

weight? Forget about it -- I'm

gonna blow up like a balloon. I

ain't never gonna hold my weight

down. Seven months! I don't know...

JOEY

We did what we had to do. Tommy

don't forget. Sooner or later

you'll get your shot -- if Tommy

don't die.

lot more "No comments" where that

one came from.

JOEY (CONT'D)

I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have

JAKE

I can't eat a steak. If I eat a

steak, I'm gonna have trouble

making the weigh-in.

JOEY

So eat just a little. You gotta eat

something.

JARS

What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I

can't even eat!

DOCTOR

JOEY

Jake, somebody wants to say hello

COMO

Hey champ!

JAKE

Tommy, thanks for coming over.

You just take it easy, now. You'll

do all right. Feelin' Ok?

JAKE

Need anything?

JAKE

No, we're all right. Thanks anyway,

Tommy.

COMO

Ok, champ.

Look at her. As beautiful as

always. Take care of that guy, will

ya?

VICKIE

(going to the door with

him)

I'll take care of him. Thanks,

Tommy. Bye.

JAKE

(to Vickie)

C'mere.

JAKE (CONT'D)

(pushing her toward the

bed area)

Hey, you don't say goodbye to him

like that.

VICKIE

What did I do?

JAKE

(pushing her)

You don't kiss like that. Hello and

goodbye, that's all you do.

VICKIE

All I did...

JAKE

(interrupting)

You know what I'm talking about.

Don't ever make me look bad on the

night of my big fight.

VICKIE

You're hurting my arm.

JAKE

Shut up. You just say hello and

goodbye to him. You don't kiss him

the way you did. That's out of

line.

VICKIE

But Jake... I didn't say

anything...

JAKE

Don't ever do that again. You don't

(he pushes her against the

wall)

do it!

VICKIE

(gagging)

Jake...

JAKE

You hear what I said? You don't do

it.

JAKE (CONT'D)

(pushing her again)

You don't do it.

JOEY

Jake, Jake...

JAKE

(to himself)

She ain't gonna ruin this fight for

me.

ANNOUNCER

The new middleweight champion of

the world by a knockout after nine

rounds, the Bronx Bull, Jake

LaMotta!

JAKE

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

It's a thrill to be standin' here

talking to you wonderful people. In

fact, it's a thrill to be standin'.

I haven't seen so many people since

my last fight at Madison Square

Garden. After that fight a reporter

asked me, "Jake, where do you go

from here?" I said, "To a

hospital."

JAKE (CONT'D)

I fought one hundred and six

professional fights and none of

them bums figured out how to fight

me -- they kept hitting me in the

head!

(calls to the bar)

Will somebody at the bar -- Linda?

- get me a drink. I figure if I'm

gonna work to drunks I might as

well be one of 'em! I like this

place. It's a family type club...

every night I see a lot of fathers

sitting out there with their young

daughters! That's nice.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Thanks, honey. -- She's terrific.

The kinda girl you wanta take home

to meet your father. Especially if

your old man's a degenerate! --

Here's a toast! "To your health!

You only live once. But if you play

it right, once is enough." I

shouldn't be drinkin' like this

'cause I'm tryin' to lose weight.

I'm on this terrific diet -- I'm

allowed to eat anything I want. As

long as I don't swallow it! Well, I

never had much luck with my weight.

In fact, -- I never had much luck

with anything -- until about a few

years ago, when this happened --

JAKE (CONT'D)

... thanks, I'm glad to see you

remember. For those of you that

don't... that's me takin' the title

from Cerdan.

You know, the tough thing about

winnin' the title... the next thing

you gotta do is have a rematch...

just to show it wasn't no fluke. So

what happens? Marcel Cerdan, a

really great champ, after I beat

him... he gets himself killed in

that airplane crash... a pretty

rotten break for him. That's why I

don't like to fly. People say to

me, "Look, Jake, when your time is

up, your time is up." And I say,

"Yeah, but suppose I'm on the plane

and the pilot's time is up?" As

good as Cerdan was, I could've

taken him again. But I never got

the chance to prove it wasn't no

fluke. He got killed but he got to

be what they call a legend. I don't

know what's worse -- bein' a fluke

or bein' a legend. -- That's the

kinda luck I got. That's why I quit

the ring and moved down here from

New York. My wife said, "You gotta

get outa this town, Jake." Come to

think of it... the boxing

commission said the same thing! But

I don't miss New York. Give me

Miami any day.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Miami's a great place. I get along

with everybody in this town... even

the police force... They got the

best cops here money can buy! --

Only kiddin'. By the way... me and

my wife Vickie's gettin' ready to

celibrate our eleventh wedding

anniversary.

JAKE (CONT'D)

We get along real great. We fight a

little but I never really belted

her on purpose. Once  in a while

I'm standin' there doin' little

shadow-boxin' and she happens to

walk right into the shadow... I

can't help that.

She says, "Whataya hittin' me for?"

I says, "It's nothin'. It's only a

love tap." She says, "It's a good

thing you're not crazy about me!" --

I am crazy about her. I heard her

talkin' to a friend on the phone

and she was sayin', "After eleven

years, I'm still in love with the

same guy." -- If I ever find out

who the bum is, I'll kill him!

Women. You can't live with 'em, you

can't live without 'em.

JAKE (CONT'D)

"'Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy.

It is the green-eyed monster, which

doth mock the meat it feeds on.

That cuckold lives in bliss who,

certain of his fate, loves not his

woronger; But O, what damned

minutes tells he o'er who dotes,

yet doubts -- suspects, yet fondly

loves!" -- That's from somethin'

called "Othello" --

JAKE (CONT'D)

Is whispering nothing? Is leaning

cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?

Kissing with inside lip? Stopping

the career of laughter with a sign?

-- A note infallible of breaking

honesty -- horsing foot on foot?

Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks

more swift? Hours, minutes? Noon,

midnight? and all eyes blind with

the pin and web but theirs, theirs

only, that would unseen be wicked?

Is this nothing? Why, then the

world and all that's in't is

nothing; The covering sky is

nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife

is nothing; nor nothing have these

nothings, if this be nothing." --

That's from something called "The

Winter's Tale" -- Shakespeare! You

all remember Shakespeare.

He wrote all them famous plays one

after the other, then he went into

a big slump and he ain't done

anything good in years. That speech

is about jealousy -- jealousy's a

bad thing. Jealousy bothers a lot

of guys... take me... I almost

killed my brother... I love him...

he's my family... I mean, there's

nothin' he wouldn't do for me. And

that's the way we been goin' thru

life -- doin' nothin' for each

other! Anytime he got in trouble

when we was kids, I got him out of

it. You know, he used to steal

little things when we was growin'

up. But he was particular... only

stole things that begin with an 'a'

-- a watch, a car, a suit, a

ring... But I was wrong... I

shoulda never hit my brother.

Afterwards, I was sorry. Now every

time I need somethin' I gotta go

shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist

once told me, "When you hit your

brother you're really hittin' your

mother, but you can't admit it to

yourself." He's really crazy. I

woulda never hit my mother. I mean,

only in self-defense!

VICKIE

Jake, you're home.

JOEY

Hi, Vickie.

VICKIE

What's the matter with you?

JAKE

Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to

work. Paid all this money for it

and still can't get a station a

mile away. And Mr. Wizard here

ain't no help.

JOEY

Screw you, Jack.

JAKE

(to Vickie)

Where you been?

VICKIE

I went out.

JAKE

(to Joey)

What's that kissing on the mouth

shit?

JOEY

What? I just said hello. Since when

I can't kiss my sister-in-law?

JAKE

Ain't a cheek ever good enough for

you? I never even kissed Mama on

the mouth.

JOEY

Well, you're not supposed to kiss

your mother on the mouth.

JAKE

Well, that's what I mean.

JAKE (CONT'D)

How's that?

JOEY

I can't tell. You're stomach's in

the way.

JOEY (CONT'D)

Don't give me those looks. I'm just

your manager. The minute you start

to be champ, you start eating like

there's no tomorrow. And you giving

me looks. All I know is that I

don't have to defend my title next

month.

JAKE

Answer me somethin'. What happened

at the Copa with Salvy when I was

out of town?

JOEY

When?

JAKE

You know, when you gave him a

beatin'.

JOEY

(being as vague as

possible)

Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He

was drunk or somethin', I dunno.

Anyway, the windup was I gave him a

beatin'. Tommy called me down, and

we straightened it out. It's all

forgotten about.

JAKE

Why didn't you tell me about it?

JOEY

It didn't have nothin' to do with

you.

JAKE

Didn't it have nothin' to do with

me?

JOEY

No, I just told you what happened.

JAKE

(he obviously knows)

Who did it have anything to do

with... Vickie?

JOEY

Jack, no. I just explained the

whole thing to you. It was just

between me and Salvy, if it had

anything to do with you and Vickie,

I woulda told you about it.

JAKE

Well, I heard some things.

JOEY

"You heard some things." Will you

stop worryin' about that shit?

Forget about it. You know you got a

title fight comin' up.

JOEY

(refering to the TV)

Whatever you touched, that's good

now.

JAKE

Did Salvy fuck Vickie?

JOEY

What?

JAKE

You're supposed to keep an eye on

her for me. I'm askin'...

JOEY

(interrupting)

I did keep an eye...

JAKE

Then why did you give him a beatin'

if he didn't do anything? You and

him been friends a long time.

JOEY

Some things changed between us.

Now, he thinks who the fuck he is.

He's been passing certain remarks

that I don't like.

JAKE

(interrupting)

Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't

tellin' me the truth.

JOEY

What bullshit? Hey, I'm your

brother. You wanna believe me - you

trust me?

JAKE

When it comes to her, I don't trust

nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.

JOEY

Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm

tellin" you what happened. He got

outta line, we had a fight, and

it's staightened out now.

JAKE

(suspicious)

You givin' me that look. I gotta

accept your word, but if I find out

anythin', I'm gonna kill

somebody...

JOEY

(yelling)

So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill

Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy

Como, kill me while you're at it.

What do I care? You're killing

yourself the way you're eating, the

way you worry about things you

don't have to worry about.

JAKE

(interrupting)

What do you mean, "you"?

JOEY

What?

JAKE

(interrupting, catching

Joey)

What do you mean, "you"?

JOEY

(caught)

I meant, kill everybody. You or me

or anybody. You're a big shot.

Kill, kill... g'head.

JAKE

But you said "you."

JOEY

So what?

JAKE

Eh, Joey, even you don't know what

you meant. You mentioned Salvy,

Tommy Como, you -- that means

somethin'. Why'd you say them? You

coulda said anybody.

JOEY

You're worried about this girl,

you're gonna let this girl ruin

you're life for you... You wanna

worry, worry about your fuckin'

stomach that you can't bend over --

that you gotta step in the ring in

a month.

JAKE

Did you ever fuck my wife?

JOEY

What?

JAKE

I don't mean now. I mean before --

before we met.

JOEY

Whadda ya mean?

JAKE

Did you ever fuck my wife?

JOEY

Whatsa matter with you?

JAKE

You're very smart, Joey, very

smart. Nobody gives me a straight

answer around here.

You're givin' me these answers, but

you still didn't answer my

question. Did you fuck Vickie?

JOEY

(fed up, he starts to

leave)

I gotta go. I gotta get outta here.

I can't take this shit. Lenore is

waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're

a definite wacko. You're fuckin'

crazy, you know that, crazy.

JAKE

Where you been all day?

VICKIE

I took the kids to my sister's.

JAKE

I called. You weren't there.

VICKIE

I got bored so I went to the

movies.

JAKE

What'd you see?

VICKIE

I went to the movies.

JAKE

What'd you see?

VICKIE

"Father of the Bride."

JAKE

What was it about?

VICKIE

Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I

have to tell you everything?

JAKE

Did you ever go to the Copa when I

was away?

VICKIE

What're you talking about?

JAKE

Answer me when I talk to you. What

happened that night?

VICKIE

(interrupting, yelling)

I am answering...

JAKE

(hits her)

What do I have to do to get a

straight answer around here.

VICKIE

Jake, no --

JAKE

(as he chases her around

the room)

Do I have to kill you, eh?

(hits her)

Do I have to kill somebody to get

an answer?

(hits her)

I know about you at the Copa. I

know all about it.

VICKIE

I didn't do anything wrong. I

swear. I just had a few drinks.

JAKE

(pins her down, hits her)

With Salvy, eh?

VICKIE

I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy

was there.

(gets hit)

Stop it. I just had a drink, that's

all. I didn't do anything wrong.

(gets hit)

JAKE

(by bathroom door)

Come out of there! Did you fuck

Salvy?

(punches door)

Answer me. Open this fuckin' door,

you fuckin' cunt!

(punches door)

Who've you been fuckin'?

VICKIE

(from inside bathroom)

Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.

JAKE

You're a fuckin' liar.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Who've you been fuckin'? Salvy?

(hits her)

Tommy Como?

(hits her)

I can't trust nobody.

(hits her)

Did you fuck Joey?

(hits her)

Who you been fuckin'?

VICKIE

All right, I fucked everybody! Go

ahead, kill me, kill me.

VICKIE (CONT'D)

I'll say anything you want me to

say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked

Tommy. I fucked your brother. I

fucked everybody! What do you want

to hear? I sucked your brother's

fuckin' cock!

JAKE

You did?

VICKIE

Yeah, I sucked his cock.

JOEY

(to kids)

Don't hit your brother! Be nice.

JOEY (CONT'D)

Jake, stop it.

JAKE

Was Vickie part of the deal with

Tommy? Was my wife part of the

deal? Tell me, was that it?

JOEY

Stop it. What're you, crazy?

JAKE

(kneeling over Joey and

hitting him)

You didn't tell me. You didn't tell

me. You let me marry her. You let

me marry her.

VICKIE

(hitting Jake on his back

as he hits Joey)

You're killing him. You're killing

him for nothing. Stop it.

JAKE

(hits her)

Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you

mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!

VICKIE

(still hitting Jake)

Nothing is what I said! Go on, kull

me.

(hits him)

Kill me.

(hits him)

I'm not afraid of you anymore. I

don't care if you kill me like

you're killing him. You're a sick

animal.

JAKE

(to Vickie)

You're the fuckin' animal! You ran

around with every guy I knew while

I was breakin' my ass for you.

VICKIE

(as she pushes and hits

Jake to the front door)

You're not only an animal, you're a

stupid animal.

(pushes and hits him out

the front door)

You're rotten.

(hits him)

Rotten.

(hits him)

Rotten.

(hits him)

You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You

belong in a mental hospital.

DISSOLVE TO:

VICKIE

Well, he ain't dead in case you're

interested.

(pause)

I'm leaving you. And I don't care

if you do try to kill me. Go ahead.

I'm not afraid of you anymore.

There's worse things than being

dead and one of them's living with

you --

(pause)

I'm leaving tonight. I must have

been crazier than you are for

stayin' with you this long. You're

hopeless. You're not gonna let

anybody love you. I kept thinking

that you'd change when you got to

be the champ... But I just can't

take it anymore. I'm taking the

kids and I'm leavin'.

JAKE

Aw, Vickie, aw Vickie, please no.

Vickie, no... don't leave me.

Christ, I'm pleading... I know, I

know all the bad things, but I need

you. I'm a bum without you and the

kids. I'll change. Aw, Vickie,

maybe I don't do it the right way,

but I love you. I love you.

VICKIE

You know, if there's one thing -- I

just don't understand you, not one

single little bit. You love me?

JAKE

Yeah --

DISSOLVE TO:

TONY

It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.

JAKE

(barely coherent)

What time is it?

TONY

Nine o'clock.

JAKE

At night?

TONY

Yeah. At night.

JAKE

How many pounds I gotta lose?

TONY

Three more, I figure.

JAKE

Just give me a chip of ice to put

in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.

TONY

I'll give you anything you want,

Jake. I think you should come out

for a few minutes -- give yourself

a break.

JAKE

(barely audible)

Are you outa your mind? If I come

out, I'll lose the title.

VICKIE

Jake, why don't you just try lying

down and get some rest.

JAKE

I don't know what it is. I dunno,

it's the kind of thing that -- the

words won't come out.

VICKIE

Jake --

JAKE

What?

VICKIE

I want to say something to you

without you blowing your stack.

JAKE

OK. Talk.

VICKIE

(pause)

Why don't you just call him up?

JAKE

What do I say to him? Call him up

on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm

sorry about that little trouble we

had. How about havin' dinner?" Is

that what I say?

VICKIE

No, not that.

JAKE

Then what?

VICKIE

(pause)

I don't know.

RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER

... Ladies and gentlemen, I've sat

in front of these microphones for

over twenty years but this is the

strangest championship bout I've

ever seen. With two minutes to go

in the final round, the champion,

the mighty Bull from the Bronx, is

just simply taking punch after

punch from the challenger.

Dauthuille scores a combination,

then backpedals. LaMotta pursues

him. One minute to go. Laurent

DauthuiLlle, who has already beat

Lamotta in a non-title bout, is

about to fulfill a dream -- to

bring the middleweight crown back

to France.

RINGSIDE'ANNOUNCER

Thirty seconds to go. The Bull

starts to swing. LaMotta comes in

for a brutal body combinaticn: one,

two, three, four punches. LaMotta

has landed a solid left hook to the

Frenchman's jaw! Dauthuille seems

confused. LaMotta is swinging

wildly now: right, left, right,

left! Dauthuille is backing off!

Everyone is on their feet! I can

hardly see, ladies and gentlemen.

Dauthuille is on the ropes. LaMotta

hits a right -- Dauthuille is down!

Dauthuille is down! Referee Lou

Handler is counting him out --

three, four, five -- if Dauthuille

can stand, he'll win the decision --

eight, nine --  Dauthuille is on

one knee -- ten! It's all over!

With thirteen seconds left on the

clock, Jake LaMotta has retained

his middleweight championship in

one of the most remarkable combacks

in boxing! Dauthuille is standing

now, confused. But the fight is

over.

ANNOUNCER

The middleweight champion, and

still champion by a knockout in

fifteen rounds, the Bronx Bull, the

Raging Bull, Jake LaMotta!

JAKE

(to Vickie)

I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.

VICKIE

Why don't you just call him?

JAKE

I dunno.

VICKIE

Tell him how you feel -- you miss

him. Tell him you're sorry.

JAKE

(pauze)

Ok, all right. Telephone's in the

hall. Dial his number.

THE HALLWAY

As the number starts to ring,

VICKIE hands the phone to JAKE.

JOEY (O.S.)

Hello... hello...

JOEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

What's this, a joke? Hello... Hey!

JOEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Well, if there's somebody

listenin', their mother's a fuckin'

whore who takes it in the ass.

JAKE

(continuing his monologue)

I shoulda never hit my brother.

Afterwards I was sorry. Now every

time I need somethin' I gotta go

shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist

once told me, "When you hit your

brother you're really hittin' your

mother but you can't admit it to

yourself." He's really crazy. I

woulda never hit my mother. I mean,

only in self-defense! A lot of

people wanta know who was the best

guy I ever fought. Let's see...

there was that one I fought

twice... the other Frenchman... you

know who I mean...

(having trouble

pronouncing the name)

... Dauthuille! He was tough, but I

beat him... I had to! I mean, how

would it sound losin' to a guy

whose name you can't even

pronounce? But... Robinson. I can

say that alright. I fought Sugar

Ray so many times it's a wonder I

don't have diabetes! Linda... get

me another drink! Linda's the most

popular waitress here... you can

tell by her tips! She's the kinda

girl I go for. You oughta see the

ones I get.

JAKE (CONT'D)

... Thanks, babe. She's a nice kid.

She'll only do it with a guy if she

really likes him. She's got a lot

in common with Will Rogers -- never

met a man she didn't like! ... I

was talkin' about Sugar Ray. Some

of you think I was better than

him... but you know, it's a toss

up. Except the last fight...

February 14, 1951.

JAKE(CONT'D)

Valentine's Day. The anniversary of

the St. Valentine's Massacre.

Robinson didn't use a machine gun

but it was still a massacre...

JAKE (CONT'D)

Actually, I was doin' okay at

first. In fact, by the end of the

fifth round I really had him

worried -- he thought he killed me.

LENORE

Look at that. The sonofabitch is

outboxing Robinson.

JOEY

I can't believe he's getting that

jab in.

PABST COMMERCIAL

"Friend, the quality that has

carried Pabst Blue Ribbon around

the world is yours for the asking.

Next time that friendly bartender

says, 'What'll you have?' give him

the answer the whole world gives,

Pabst Blue Ribbon!"

JAKE

He ain't hurting me, but I can't

get him down.

TONY

Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab,

jab. You're ahead on points.

S.R.'S TRAINER

He's going, Sugar. He's old. He

ain't Jake LaMotta no more. Make

your move, Sugar. Kill him!

TV ANNOUNCER

LaMotta's on queer street, but he's

still standing. Robinson throws a

right, a left, a right, a right and

a right again! How can LaMotta stay

on his feet?

TV ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

No man can take this kind of

punishment. LaMotta is just a rag

doll now. God knows what's holding

him up. This is an historic

beating. Sugar Rav staggers LaMotta

with a left and comes across with a

blackjack punch to the champion's

head. The referee is stepping in,

Robinson has LaMotta on the ropes.

That's it! Sugar Ray Robinson,

former welterweight champion, has

taken the middleweight crown from

Jake LaMota.

JAKE

You never knocked me down. You

could never knock me down.

ROBINSON

So what?

JAKE

I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's

TV bout 'cause I can't make the

weight. I'm fighting at light

heavyweight, and I still can't make

the weight.

REPORTER

Does that mean...

JAKE

It means I'm through with boxing.

I'm tired with tryin' to make the

weight anymore. I'm sick of

thinkin' about weight, weight,

weight.

REPORTER

You sound bitter.

JAKE

Why should I be bitter? Boxing's

been good to me. I got a nice

house, three kids, a beautiful wife

-- take a picture of her. Vickie.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been

Mrs. America if I didn't pull her

outa the contest. Didn't want her

wearing a swimsuit for nobody but

me.

REPORTER

What do you think of Jake's

retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?

JAKE

I also bought a club on Collins

Avenue, and I'm gonna open it real

soon. Know what I'm gonna call it?

"Jake LaMotta's."

JAKE

Valentine's Day. The anniversary of

the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.

Robinsin didn't use a machine gun

but it was still a massacre...

(takes another drink)

Actually, I was doin' okay at

first. In fact, by the end of the

fifth round I really had him

worried --- he thought he killed

me. You know, I could keep tellin'

you this brilliant material all

night -- but you'd only laugh. Now

I'm gonna sing. -- Any requests? I

mean, besides "don't"!

(then to piano player)

-- In the key of H.

(then to audience)

You're laughin'. Give me the right

key and I'll play in anybody's

flat! I sing for a reason. When I

finish, you'll be so sobered up,

we'll sell a lot of booze.

JAKE (CONT'D)

"When the fighter's not engaged in

his employment, his employment,

although he was Champ and quite the

rage, he must go somewhere else to

seek employment, seek employment.

So what does he do? He goes upon

the stage and meets his true

adversaries, all you members of the

human race. But a fighter's life is

not a bowl of cherries, still I'd

rather have an egg than a fist upon

my face... That's Entertainment!

JAKE (CONT'D)

J.R., glad you could make it.

J.R.

You were great, Jake. Just like old

times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't

here tonight. Oh Jake, this is

State's Attorney Bronson and his

wife.

JAKE

(joking)

Sorry, empty! Heh, heh! Oh, I

didn't mean that. If I don't give

your husband no money, he won't

have enough to buy you a drink. To

show you I'm a nice guy, this one's

on me. The last one was your

payment for this month.

JAKE (CONT'D)

You're a good sport, lady.

J.R.

I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in

'46, Jake. In Chicago. You were

great.

JAKE

Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.

J.R.

Where's your wife, Jake?

JAKE

Do you think I'd let her in a place

like this with guys like you

hangin' around?

J. R.

You ought to see his wife.

JAKE

Hey, Ricky, glad you came.

RICKY

Wouldn't miss it, Jake.

JAKE

Hey, honey, give these fellas a

round on me. I can tell they're

gonna be regular customers.

WAITRESS

I'll have to ask for your I.D.

JAKE

Whew! Any girl that can kiss like

that can drink in my club any time!

VICKIE

Jake.

JAKE

I'm sorry. I had to work late last

night. Slept at the club.

VICKIE

I'm leaving your Jake.

JAKE

Sure, what else is new?

VICKIE

No. This time it's true. I didn't

bother to tell you until I had

everything worked out.

JAKE

Open the door, Vickie.

VICKIE

No. I won't talk to you where you

can use your hands on me.

JAKE

Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.

VICKIE

I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting

a divorce. I'm getting custody of

the kids.

JAKE

Aw, c'mon, Vick --

VICKIE

I'm sick of it. I can't watch you

this way. You're too drunk all the

time. There's too many girls. I

can't... I don't wanna talk about

it. I made up my mind.

VICKIE (CONT'D)

You got three days to get your

stuff out of the house. After that,

the cops will be there. I have the

kids with me. I never want to see

you again.

1ST DEPUTY

Let's go, Jake, wake up!

JAKE

Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?

1ST DEPUTY

(showing badge)

We're from...

JAKE

(interrupting)

I know where you're from. You guys

look the same every place.

1ST DEPUTY

They wanna talk to you.

JAKE

About what?

1ST DEPUTY

I don't run the joint. They just

told me to bring you in.

JAKE

For what?

2ND DEPUTY

C'mon, get dressed.

JAKE

Hey, I'm a big tax payer down here.

Don't that entitle me to some

information what this is all about?

2ND DEPUTY

You recognize this girl? She been

in the club?

JAKE

I dunno.

2ND DEPUTY

She says you introduced her to men.

JAKE

I introduced a lot of people to

men. So what? What does that mean?

2ND DEPUTY

She's fourteen.

JAKE

Vickie, open up. I need to come in.

VICKIE

Are you drunk?

JAKE

No. Open the door.

JAKE (CONT'D)

Please, Vick. I won't bother you.

I'm out on bail. You can send the

kids next door. I just gotta pick

one thing up, then I'll get outa

here.

VICKIE

The kids are sleeping.

JAKE

I promise I just gotta pick up one

thing.

VICKIE

All right, just don't make any

noise.

VICKIE

What are you doing?

JAKE

I need ten thousand dollars. My

lawyer says if we can spread ten

thousand bucks around, we can get

the case dropped.

VICKIE

But they don't have a case against

you.

JAKE

(digging at the belt)

Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a

14-year-old testify in court? Did

you see the papers? "LaMotta on

Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot

at the Champ.

VICKIE

Jake, be careful! What're you doing

to the belt?!

JAKE

Don't make no difference no more.

VICKIE

Can't you get the money from your

friends?

JAKE

What friends?

JEWELER

Didn't you also wish to sell the

Championship Belt, Mr. LaMotta?

JAKE

That's it. Those are the jewels

that were in the belt.

JEWELER

But where's the belt?

JAKE

You want the jewels or the belt?

JEWELER

Both. These stones are worth about

fifteen hudred dollars, but the

belt of a champion is a very rare

item. The belt with the stones

untouched would have been worth

near five thousand dollars.

JAKE

(on phone)

I can't raise the ten thousand.

Fuck 'em. Let 'em put me on trial.

JAKE

So there I am in the can... and not

the one that says "gentlemen" on

the door. I'm talkin' about jail!

Down south!

I mean, jail up north is gotta be

like summer camp compared to jail

down in cracker country. And if

you're a guy like me, you ain't got

a chance in a place like that.

Especially if you're Italian... you

come from the Bronx... and you're

an ex-champ. As soon as they saw

me... soon as they heard me... I

know I'm in trouble. To me, they

got an accent, and to them, I got

an accent! You gotta get the

picture -- I'm big, I got small

hands, I walk like I'm still in the

ring... the balls of my feet pop up

and down, you know... and whenever

I get the chance, I read a lot. So

naturally, takin' all this into

co

sideration, they figure it adds up

to one thing -- I'm queer! Now I

didn't mind too much when they

called me "Queer" or "Mr. Tough

Guy" or "Yankee Punk"... But one

day these screws got to me... I was

workin' on the work gang, pickin'

up some trees that were knocked

down by a storm or somethin' and

puttin' 'em on this truck. All of a

sudden... one of the trees slipped

and fell on me and pinned me to the

ground. I'm lyin' there with a tree

across my chest! This screw walks

over, takin' his time, he looks

down at me and says, "Well, Champ

Pimp... you lyin' down on the job

again?"! They got a great sense of

humor when they're standin' there

with a gun in their arms and you

got a tree on your chest! So I look

up at him and say, "Oh, this

tree... it fell on me." And he

says, "Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have

known, I would've yelled 'timber'"

I said, "Hey, look... it hurts. I

think maybe I broke somethin'!" He

says, "Well, whaddaya know... Champ

PImp's got himself a boo-boo." Then

I got as stupid as him. I said, "If

I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin'

me the money you made last night?"!

Then another screw comes over and

says, "This Yankee creep givin' you

trouble?" -- What kind of trouble?

What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with

the tree? Now anybody else in their

right mind would've said, "No sir,

I wouldn't think of giving any of

you gentlemen trouble... I just

want to serve my time and get the

hell out of here as soon as I can."

That's anybody else. When I said

it... it was a little different.

"You stupid cracker... take your

hands off me or I'll get up and

kick your brains out -- but first

you gotta bend over so I can find

'em!" Next thing I know I'm in the

hole. Solitary confinement. All my

life I had guys in my corner

yellin' "Go get 'em, jake... kill

'em! You're the greatest." Now

there's nobody rootin' for me. But

it wasn't so bad. I learned things

there. I learned how to scratch a

calendar on the wall. I never knew

how to do that before. Now I know.

Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is

two scratches. Wednesday is three

scratches. And so on. Except for

Sundays. Sundays is no scratches.

Sundays rested.

JAKE

(murmuring)

Why, why, why?

(with each bang of his

head)

I'm a man, I'm a man. I'm no

faggot. I'm not a faggot. Ma, why?

What do they want? My cock's not

enough. What do they want from me?

Why? Ma? Why?

JAKE (CONT'D)

Why, why, why me? You took it away

from me. They took everything away.

What do they want from me? What the

fuck do they want from me? I ain't

bad. I ain't bad. I'm not that guy.

I'm not that guy. I'm not a

monster. I'm not an animal.

JAKE (CONT'D)

I'm not like that. Please. I'm not

like that. Please. Please. Please.

JAKE (CONT'D)

And so, as Shakespeare said, I've

been down so low there's nowhere

else to go.

JAKE

Except here, gentlemen, with you

bums. I call you "gentlemen"... but

you know what you really are! You

know, this place used to be pretty

exclusive... now they got bouncers

outside to throw the drunks in! My

first night here I said to the

boss, "Where's the toilet?" -- He

said, "You're in it!" By the way,

this engagement is just a stepping

stone for me. If I do good here,

I'm ready to get out of the

business!

JAKE (CONT'D)

OK, OK, I know what you're waitin'

for -- and from the looks of you,

you been waitin' for it for a long

time. I had my own joint in Miami

Beach once... it was too high-class

for you guys... we had a 50-cent

minimum charge just to keep out the

riff-raff!

JAKE (CONT'D)

Hey, sorry. Here's your girls.

(grabs his crotch)

Yeah, she's here... just like it's

advertised out front. She's come

back. A girl who's seen the Lower

Depths... who's been as far as I

have in that direction. She's on

her way back up now... give you an

idea how low she was! Let's give

her a warm welcome... make her glad

she's back, boys. -- Miss Emma

48's!

JAKE

Look, sweetie, be a good girl.

Here's some money. Take a cab. Go

home by yourself. Just wanna walk

around a little, sort of unwind.

OK?

EMMA

Will I see you later?

JAKE

Yeah. I dunno... I'll call you.

DISSOLVE TO:

JAKE

Hey, Joey --

JAKE (CONT'D)

No, Joey, no. Look, wait a minute,

please --

JAKE (CONT'D)

Aw, Joey --

JAKE (CONT'D)

You're right. You're perfectly

right. You got every right in the

world to hate my guts.

JAKE (CONT'D)

No, please. I know I was a

cocksucker. You're right. I shoulda

never raised my hands to you.

JAKE (CONT'D)

No, Joey, listen to me --

JAKE (CONT'D)

Go ahead.

(gets punched)

Hit me again.

(gets punched)

I deserve it...

(gets punched)

Pay me back...

(gets punched)

More...

(gets punched)

JAKE (CONT'D)

More. Go ahead, Joey. I deserve it.

JAKE

You know, I'm not a philosopher or

anything like that but I been

around a little and the way I look

at it is -- We're, all of us,

lookin' for the same thing: a shot

at the title. No matter what you

wanta be... you wanta shot at bein'

the best. Well, I had mine and

it'll always be in the record

books... it don't make no

difference what happens to me from

here on in -- I got my shot and

that's a fact. Some guys weren't

that lucky... like the one Marlon

Brando played in "On the

Waterfront" -- an up and comer

who's now a down and outer. You

remember... there was this scene in

the back of the car with his

brother Charlie, a small-time

racket guy, and it went somethin'

like this -- "It wasn't him,

Charlie. It was you. You 'member

that night in the Garden you came

down my dressing room and said.

'Kid, this ain't your night.

We're going for the price on

Wilson.' You 'member that? 'This

ain't your night!' My night -- I

coulda taken Wilson apart! So what

happens? He gets the title shot

outdoors on the ballpark, and what

do I get? A one-way ticket to

Palookaville. I never was no good

after that night. It was like a

peak you reach. Then it went

downhill. It was you, Charlie. You

was my brother, Charlie. You

shoulda looked out for me a little

bit. You shoulda taken care of me

just a little bit so I wouldn't

have to take them dives for the

short end money... You don't

understand! I coulda had class. I

coulda been a contender. I coulda

been somebody -- instead of a bum,

which is what I am. Let's face it.

It was you, Charlie."
