THE BACHELOR PARTY

by Paddy Chayefsky

DISSOLVE TO:

HELEN

You think it's too early to call

my mother?

CHARLIE

I don't know.

HELEN

(on phone)

Hello, Ma, did I wake you up? This

is Helen.... Well, I'll be going to

work, and I wanted to get ahold of

you before I left. I called you last

night. Where were you and Pop anyway?

I kept calling you every half hour

up till one o'clock.... Oh, yeah? Did

you have a nice time? ...

HELEN'S VOICE

Well, listen, Ma, I got something to

tell you. I'm pregnant.... Yeah,

pregnant.... Of course I'm sure.

I've got the report back from the

laboratory.... No, you wouldn't know

him, Doctor Axelrod.... Second month.

He says I can expect the baby in

February.... Well, Grandma, act a

little excited, will you? ... You

bet I'm excited....

DISSOLVE TO:

HELEN

(calling to the bedroom)

Do you need any of this or can I

take them off the table?

CHARLIE

I'll clean that up in a minute.

HELEN

How late were you up last night?

CHARLIE'S VOICE

About two.

CHARLIE

I'm taking five bucks from your

drawer.

CHARLIE

A guy in my office is getting

married, and I got clipped four

bucks for his wedding present.

HELEN

Who's getting married?

CHARLIE

Arnold. I told you about him. The

guy with the sick mother.

HELEN

Oh, yeah.

CHARLIE

(trying to decide

whether he needs a

certain worksheet)

The rest of the guys are giving him

a bachelor party tonight.

HELEN

Do you want to go, Charlie?

CHARLIE

I got class tonight.

HELEN

What have you got -- cost accounting?

CHARLIE

Yes.

HELEN

I think you ought to take off a

night. You ought to go, have a little

fun for yourself. I think you need

that. You go to work all day, you go

to school all night. You can miss one

night, Charlie.

CHARLIE

No, these bachelor parties get kind

of wild sometimes. The whole

philosophy is: it's the groom's last

night of freedom. So it gets kind of

wild sometimes.

HELEN

That's a good philosophy to start a

marriage with.

CHARLIE

Well, a bunch of guys get together,

they like to tear up the town a

little.

HELEN

I think you oughta go, Charlie. I

know you're upset about the baby.

CHARLIE

I'm not upset about the baby.

HELEN

Come on, Charlie. I know how you

feel. Listen, you don't have to

pretend you're excited about the

baby. We weren't exactly planning

on a baby right now ...

CHARLIE

I'm not upset about the baby.

HELEN

It's a shock. I had some bad days

before I told you. I said: "Oh, boy,

that's all we need. A baby." Then I

said to myself: "If I'm having a

baby, I'm having a baby. That's all

there is to it." And I like the idea.

We're going to have a family,

Charlie. I like the idea.

CHARLIE

Well, give me a couple of days to

get used to the idea. I'll be all

right.

HELEN

I know you will, Charlie. That's why

I think you ought to go to this

bachelor party tonight.

CHARLIE

(bursting out)

I don't want to go to this bachelor

party.

CHARLIE

I'm sorry I yelled.

HELEN

Don't be silly.

CHARLIE

I better get going. Kenny's probably

waiting for me now. I'm sorry I

yelled like that.

HELEN

What are you sorry about? Don't I

yell at you all the time?

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

KENNETH

You going to Arnold's bachelor party?

CHARLIE

I don't think so, Kennie.

KENNETH

What?

CHARLIE

I got two classes tonight.

KENNETH

Yeah, I was going to go, but I think

I better not, because my kid, the

young one, the girl, she's been

acting up again lately. She's got

some kind of allergy, the doctors

don't know what.

CHARLIE

These bachelor parties get kind of

wild sometimes. Eddie Watkins is

making all the arrangements. He's

probably got us lined up with a

bunch of chorus girls.

KENNETH

Yeah, do you think so?

CHARLIE

You know Eddie.

KENNETH

Yeah, boy, he really lives it up,

don't he? Did you see that blonde

who picked him up for lunch last

week? Boy, sometimes I wish I was a

bachelor. Well, you know what I mean.

I never seem to get out of the house

any more, you know what I mean?

About once a week, I go to the

movies. We never even see the whole

picture. My wife starts worrying

about the kids. My youngest kid, the

girl, she's got some kind of rash.

We don't know what it is. I never

seem to see anybody any more. Do you

know how long it is since I've seen

Willie Duff? I haven't seen Willie

in about six months. My wife can't

stand his wife. You ever seen her,

Willie's wife?

CHARLIE

No, I didn't know Willie too well.

KENNETH

Boy, wait'll you have kids, boy.

You'll never get out of the house.

CHARLIE

Helen's pregnant now.

KENNETH

No kidding.

CHARLIE

Yeah.

KENNETH

Oh, that's wonderful, Charlie,

that's wonderful!

KENNETH

Hey, there's a guy down there,

trying to pick up a girl down there.

KENNETH

Were you with us about eight years

ago when I picked up that chick in

front of the bus stop in Paterson,

New Jersey?

CHARLIE

When was this?

KENNETH

Yeah, you were there. You were with

that girl from Brooklyn. We just

came from Palisades Amusement Park,

and we were driving Frankie Klein's

girl home, and the car broke down

right in the middle of Route One.

CHARLIE

(beginning to laugh)

Oh, yeah.

KENNETH

(laughing)

And Frankie opened up the hood and

the water cap blew right up in the

air.

CHARLIE

And the cop came over ...

KENNETH

That's right, the cop. He thought

Frankie shot off a gun....

KENNETH

He was going to pull us all in. Oh,

man!

CHARLIE

Frankie, he was funny.

KENNETH

Oh, that was a lot of fun, those

days.

CHARLIE

Yeah, they were.

KENNETH

Hey, this guy's making out all right.

She's giving him the eye now.

KENNETH

(looking out the

window at the passing

local station)

Where are we now, Prince Street? I

bet you he picks her up before we

hit Chambers Street.

CHARLIE

Boy, I'm bushed today. I was up till

two o'clock last night on this thing

here. I'm getting to be a nervous

wreck. I snarled at Helen this

morning. I think this whole night

school business is getting me down.

KENNETH

I don't see how you do it.

CHARLIE

Neither do I. I thought I was

through with it. The plan was for me

to quit work and go to college full

time and cram through in a year or

so. But now we got this kid coming,

and Helen's going to have to quit

her job, and that sets me back where

I started from. Another five years

of this, summers included.

KENNETH

I couldn't do it, man, I'll tell you

that. I wish I could, but I couldn't.

CHARLIE

Oh, what am I griping about? This is

the life I picked out for myself.

But it's a grind, boy, I tell you.

YOUNG FELLOW

(to the girl)

Excuse me, can you tell me how to

get to the Nassau Street exit?

GIRL

Well ... well, at the top of the

stairs, you'll see all the signs.

YOUNG FELLOW

Are you getting off here?

GIRL

Yes.

YOUNG FELLOW

Well, I'll follow you then. That'll

be easier, if you don't mind.

GIRL

No, not at all.

DISSOLVE TO:

KENNETH

Hiya, Walter.

CHARLIE

Hiya, Walter.

KENNETH

(poking in his desk

drawer; amiably)

Walter, what time do you come in in

the mornings? You're making us all

look lousy, you know that? I get

the feeling sometimes, you stay here

overnight.

CHARLIE

Arnold in yet?

WALTER

He starts his vacation today. He's

getting married Sunday, you know.

WALTER

(a nervous, anxious man)

Well, the doctor was over last night.

Brought over the X rays; brought

over the allergy tests. Brought over

a bill for sixty-eight dollars.  I

said to him: "Doctor, you're a young

man, professional, highly educated,

four years of college, two years of

premedical training, several years

of interning, of residency. If

you're so smart, how can you charge

me sixty-eight dollars? One thing

they apparently didn't teach you in

medical school. You can't get blood

from a stone."

KENNETH

So what's wrong with you, Walter?

WALTER

What's wrong? I have to go to

Arizona, that's what's wrong. I have

asthma. When I was a kid, they

called it hay fever, and you carried

a bag around your neck. Asafetida.

Now, they call it asthma, and you

have to go to Arizona. I said to him:

"Doctor, you're a professional man,

four years of college, premedical

school, Bellevue, several diplomas.

Answer me a question. Who's going to

pay for Arizona?" I said to him:

"Doctor," I said, "perhaps you have

the illusion I am the Aga Khan. I

have a bearing about me, perhaps,

that misleads you to believe I have

blood ties with the Whitneys and the

Rockefellers. This isn't true."

Arizona. Did you ever hear of such

nonsense?

KENNETH

How serious is it, Walter?

WALTER

Serious. Nothing serious. I have hay

fever, I sneeze a couple of times.

The idiot told my wife I have to go

to Arizona, and she wouldn't leave

me alone all night. She's already

packing the bags. I said: "For

heaven's sakes, you listen to

doctors, we'll all be dead." My son,

Harold, believe me, he's going to be

a doctor. That's some racket, boy.

Sixty-eight dollars.

WALTER

You better get to work. Hey, Charlie,

that was the bell. I think Flaherty

is here this morning. We'll all be

fired today. I have a feeling.

DISSOLVE TO:

WALTER

(without looking

up from his work)

You fellows going to Arnold's party

tonight?

KENNETH

(without looking up)

No, I'm not going, are you?

WALTER

No. Eddie already hooked me for four

bucks for Arnold's present. This

dinner is going to cost another

couple of good dollars.

CHARLIE

It looks like nobody's going to

Arnold's bachelor party.

WALTER

You ain't going?

CHARLIE

No, I'm not going.

WALTER

Eddie's going to be mad.

CHARLIE

I told Eddie last week I couldn't

make it. I've got school. Eddie's a

bachelor. It's all right for him to

go rooting around town, picking up

girls.

WALTER

Yeah, you get married you give that

kind of thing up.

KENNETH

Yeah, Charlie says Eddie has a whole

bunch of chorus girls lined up for

us tonight.

WALTER

No kidding.

CHARLIE

I didn't say that. I just said that

if I knew Eddie, we'd probably wind

up with some of his crazy girl

friends.

KENNETH

I don't know where he gets all these

girls. He's a screwy looking jerk.

WALTER

Did you see that blonde who was up

here looking for him last week?

KENNETH

Yeah. He told me she was a

television actress. I think I saw

her once on "Studio One." She was in

a coal mine with some stir-crazy

coalminer who was trying to strangle

her with a necktie.

WALTER

I'd like to strangle her with a

necktie.

KENNETH

Now, Walter, an old married man like

you, with asthma and everything.

WALTER

I get real jealous of Eddie

sometimes. He's as free as a bird.

Did you see that convertible he's

got?

KENNETH

Yeah, he really banged it up I hear.

WALTER

You ought to see the old heap I've

got. He walks out of here on payday,

he can spend the whole works on

having himself a good time. I walk

out of here, and I got three kids

and a wife, all of them with their

palms out. I lost two bucks playing

poker at my house last week. It was

an economic catastrophe. My wife

didn't sleep all night.

CHARLIE

He's late again.

WALTER

He'll be twenty minutes late again.

If Flaherty walked in now, he'd fire

him. If that ever happened to me, I

think I'd kill myself. What does

Eddie care? So he scrambles around

for another job. Flaherty told me

last week I had too many days off.

I told him I was sick in bed. What

do you want me to do?

WALTER

Hi, Eddie, you're early today, only

twenty minutes late, what happened?

EDDIE

(muttering through

reluctant lips)

Flaherty come in yet?

KENNETH

No.

EDDIE

Mary, give me an outside line....

(he pauses, checks

the number in the

phone book again,

dials, waits)

Hello, is this Leathercraft on

Madison Avenue? ... This is Mr.

Watkins. I was in about a week ago.

I ordered a military set and a

wallet. They were supposed to be

ready yesterday.... Yes, please,

would you? ...

(he is searching

his pockets while

he waits, finds a

piece of paper,

pulls it out)

Yeah, a military set and a wallet....

WALTER

Is that what we bought poor Arnold?

EDDIE

(on phone)

That's right. The following

inscriptions should be on them:

(reads from the paper)

On the military set: "To Arnold:

Best wishes on your marriage from

Alice, Charlie, Eddie, Evelyn,

Jeanette with two t's, Kenneth,

Lucy, Mary, Olga, Walter, and

Flaherty." Now on the wallet ...

Yeah, what? .... Yeah, that's right

-- Flaherty. Now, on the wallet,

the following inscription: "To my

Best Friend Arnold from his Best Man

Eddie." ... No, to my best friend

Arnold. ... That's right. "From his

best man Eddie" ... Now, can I come

in at lunch and pick them up? ...

WALTER

What's this, Jeanette?

GIRL

It's from finance, don't ask me.

EDDIE

(on phone)

Mary, give me the Hotel Westmore.

Circle 7-0598.

CHARLIE

(hands Kennie paper)

This isn't for me -- it's for you.

EDDIE

(to the others)

Now who owes me on the presents?

Charlie, you owe me?

CHARLIE

I gave you four bucks yesterday....

KENNETH

I owe you, Eddie. I'll pay you

tomorrow, payday.

EDDIE

(on phone)

Miss Frances Kelley, please. I

think it's room 417....

EDDIE

(calling to one

of the women in

the office)

Hey, Evelyn, you owe me four bucks.

EVELYN

(calling back)

All right. I know.

EDDIE

(on phone)

Hello, Frances, this is Eddie....

All right, wait a minute. Give me a

chance to explain.... I know I woke

you up.... All right, let me tell

you. You know I'm supposed to be the

best man at this fellow Arnold's

wedding. So I called him up last

night because I didn't know whether

I was supposed to wear tuxedo or

tails. Well, he didn't know either,

so he said: "Come on over to my

girl's house with me tonight.

They're making all the arrangements

for the wedding now." So I called

you and left a message at the desk

saying I couldn't get over till

about ten o'clock.... All right!

That's what I'm going to explain!

... Thank you.

(holds receiver

against his chest

and looks at his

colleagues with

air of a man being

tried just a little

too much. Returns

receiver to his ear,

listens for a moment)

All right, so I had to go over to

Arnold's girl's house with Arnold

last night. Well, there was about

thirty people there, and, man, you

never saw such a crazy mess. There

was this little bald-headed guy

there. He's the bride's uncle. He's

come all the way down from Boston

with his whole family to go to the

wedding. The only trouble was, he

wasn't invited. Well, this crazy

uncle, he grabs ahold of me, he

starts shaking me by the lapels. So

I said: "What do you want from me?

I ain't the groom! I'm just trying

to find out whether I'm supposed to

wear tuxedo or tails."

(apparently this got

a laugh. Eddie breaks

into a smile)

Funny, huh? ... Look, Frances. I

have to go to work now. I'm calling

you from the office. How about

letting me make this up to you? I'll

take you out to dinner Saturday

night.... I can't make it tonight.

The bachelor party's tonight....

All right, Saturday night.... It's a

date.... S'help me.... I swear, right

on time. Eight-thirty, okay? ...

Okay, we'll have a ball. Goodbye, go

back to sleep.

EDDIE

What did I just tell that girl,

Saturday night?

KENNETH

Yeah.

EDDIE

(picks up phone)

Mary, give me Columbus 5-1098....

What do you mean personal calls!

These are business calls! Well, stop

listening to other people's

conversations.... What have you got,

stock in the company? Columbus

5-1098.

(waits)

KENNETH

Listen, Eddie, I don't think I can

go tonight. My father-in-law's in

from Akron, Ohio, and----

EDDIE

(all sweetness)

Hello, who is this, Mrs. Stebbins?

... This is Eddie, Mrs. Stebbins. I

wonder if I can talk to Muriel....

Could I speak to her? ... Thank

you....

EDDIE

(on phone)

Muriel, baby, listen, sweetie, I

can't make it Saturday night.... I'm

all loused up with this wedding I'm

supposed to be the best man at....

We have to rehearse the ceremony.

You'd think they were getting

married on television.... Yes,

sweetie, why don't I call you Monday.

Maybe, we'll work out something

before you go back to California....

All right, sweetie, good-bye.

EDDIE

Well, what do you say? I'm going to

call Louie and make a reservation

for a table for tonight. Who's

coming and who isn't? Walter, you're

coming, right? It won't cost you

more than three-fifty for the whole

meal. What do you say, Walter? You

only live once.

WALTER

(strangely sad)

That's right. You only live once.

EDDIE

Well, yes or no?

WALTER

All right, I'll come.

EDDIE

Kennie?

KENNETH

Yeah, I'll get out of the house for

a change.

EDDIE

How about you, Charlie?

CHARLIE

I don't think so, Eddie.

KENNETH

Ah, come on, Charlie, you got to

bust loose every now and then. We'll

have a couple of drinks.

EDDIE

(picks up phone)

Mary, give me an outside line and

don't give me no trouble....

Chickering 4-5099.

WALTER

Come on, Charlie, it's a short life,

believe me.

EDDIE'S VOICE

Hello, hello, Louie? Is this Louie?

... Louie, this is Eddie Watkins.

I'd like to reserve a table for

four for tonight.... For four ...

CHARLIE

Hey, Eddie ...

EDDIE'S VOICE

What?

CHARLIE

Count me in.

EDDIE

(on phone)

Louie, make that five.... Five guys

... Yeah, a bachelor party ...

FADE OUT

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

KENNETH

(finishing story)

Three hundred pounds! Isn't she kind

of fat? No, man, tall! Hey, waiter!

Waiter!

EDDIE

Hey, Charlie ...

WALTER

(to Charlie)

... so we were stationed right

outside Paris, about eight miles, a

town called Chatou ...

EDDIE

... hey, Charlie ...

WALTER

(to Charlie)

... so the first night, a whole

bunch of us swiped a jeep out of the

motor court. We had a feller there

who was a tech sergeant in the motor

court. Oh, what a character he was!

He used to get loaded every night on

that vanilla extract.

EDDIE

Hey, Charlie ...

CHARLIE

What do you want, Eddie?

EDDIE

Hey, Charlie, did I ever tell you

about the time I was stationed at

Buckley Field in Denver, and I

picked up this girl in Lakeside

Amusement Park?

WALTER

Hey, Eddie, listen to this story

I'm telling Charlie. Hey, Arnold,

I'm telling Charlie about the time

me and that crazy tech sergeant

from the motor court got loaded on

vanilla extract and went to Paris

... Hey, Kenneth ...

KENNETH

When do the Giants come back from

their road trip, does anybody know?

EDDIE

Hey, let's give out the presents now.

WALTER

Hey, Kenneth, listen to this story.

I was stationed outside of Paris,

about eight miles ...

CHARLIE

What?

KENNETH

Oh, that Paris! I was there for two

days! Clubs! You had to beat the

women off with clubs! ...

CHARLIE

(to people at

another table)

What ...? Oh, it's a bachelor party

-- this guy's getting married.

EDDIE

Listen, I want to give the

presents ...

WALTER

Well, let me tell you what

happened ...

EDDIE

Hey, you know what was a great town

for women, Hamburg!

KENNETH

Hamburg! Clubs! Clubs! You had to

beat them off with clubs! Hey,

waiter -- who's our waiter?

CHARLIE

Hey, Arnold, enjoying yourself?

EDDIE

The first night I was in Hamburg,

two Frauleins come walking right in

the barracks. So I said to the

lieutenant ...

WALTER

(bellowing out)

The best fighting outfit in the

whole fighting army was the fighting

Hundred and Fourth Infantry Division,

General Terry Allen commanding!

EDDIE

(standing)

Well, now that we got that settled....

CHARLIE

I'm with you, Walter.

ARNOLD

We believe you, Walter.

EDDIE

I'd like to make a little speech to

our guest of honor and mutual friend,

Arnold Craig. Arnold, a bunch of us

down the office, the girls too, all

chipped in, and we got you a couple

of small gifts....

WALTER

(whispering to Kenneth)

These are the gag gifts.

EDDIE

Let's see, what's this one? Oh, yeah.

Arnold, we figured Louise might be

very sleepy on your wedding night,

so we thought you might want

something to keep you warm.

WALTER

What is it? What is it?

WALTER

It's a hot-water bottle!

KENNETH

Okay, Walter, okay.

WALTER

Hey, did you see that? Hey, he bought

him a hot-water bottle for his

wedding night. Hey, that's funny ...

CHARLIE

Hey, Eddie, you should have bought

him an ice pack for after tonight.

EDDIE

(holding a

second parcel)

Walter, take it easy.... Now, this

one, Arnold, this one is something

to keep you busy on cold winter

nights.

WALTER

(crosses to Arnold;

to the others)

This ought to be good.

EDDIE

Look at Walter.

WALTER

Hey, these are funny. Who bought

these? You buy these, Eddie? These

are funny. You got a good sense of

humor.

WALTER

Hey, did you guys see that? Hey, did

you guys see that?

CHARLIE

Come on, Walter, sit down.

WALTER

Eddie got a good sense of humor, you

know?

KENNETH

(to Charlie)

Boy, old Walter is crocked.

ARNOLD

(smiling, rising

halfway in his chair)

Listen, I want to thank you. Really.

I really want to thank you fellows.

EDDIE

We haven't got to the serious

presents yet, Arnold.

EDDIE

(solemnly)

Well, in all seriousness, Arnold,

seriously, I don't know why you

picked me to be your best man, but I

am deeply honored. I guess it's

because we're both Dodger fans, and

I'm going to miss you at next

Tuesday's night game when the

Pittsburgh Pirates invade Ebbets

Field. We always had a lot of fun

together, and, seriously, Arnold,

in all seriousness, good luck on

your wedding, but see if you can't

get out of the house occasionally,

see a night game or even a Sunday

doubleheader with your old buddy,

Eddie.

EDDIE

(handing Arnold

two neatly wrapped

packages)

Well, anyway, in all seriousness,

here are a couple of presents from

all of us in the office and good

luck.

ARNOLD

Well, I just want to thank you

fellows. I don't know what to say.

I just want to thank you.

KENNETH

Open the presents, Arnold.

ARNOLD

I will. I just want to say, Eddie,

that when the Pirates invade Ebbets

Field next Tuesday night, I'm going

to be sitting right there in Section

37 there right with you.

EDDIE

You'll be on your honeymoon next

Tuesday, Arnold.

ARNOLD

Gee, that's right.

CHARLIE

(smiling)

Arnold, you're getting married

Sunday, did you forget?

WALTER

Look at him blush.

ARNOLD

(frowning fuzzily)

No, I didn't forget. It's just that

... Gee, that's right. Sunday.

What's today, Thursday?

KENNETH and EDDIE

All day!

ARNOLD

Boy, it's here, isn't it? I guess

I've been running around so much the

last couple of weeks, I guess the

wedding snuck up on me.

KENNETH

I think Arnold's having a little

buck fever. Does anyone know what

our waiter looks like?

EDDIE

(to Kenneth)

You know who didn't want to chip in

for Arnold's presents? ...

CHARLIE

Arnold'll be all right. Have a drink,

Arnold.

WALTER

I had my basic training in Camp Croft,

South Carolina, near Spartanburg.

EDDIE

I was at Maxwell Field, what a

desert.

CHARLIE

Walter, what ever happened when you

and that tech sergeant from the

motor pool got loaded on vanilla

extract?

WALTER

What tech sergeant?

CHARLIE

Walter, you're crocked.

(to Arnold)

Open up the presents -- see what you

got.

KENNETH

Hey, are you our waiter? Bring us

some ice. I got him -- I got our

waiter!

ARNOLD

It was sure nice of you fellows.

EDDIE

Hey, man, we're having a ball!

DISSOLVE TO:

ARNOLD

De-Witt C-l-i-n-t-o-n

Boom!

Clinton!

Oh, Cli-inton!

Ever to theeeee!

ARNOLD

(singing)

Fairest of high schools ...

EDDIE

How did he ever get on this alma

mater kick?

ARNOLD

(singing)

... Give her three times three

Oh, fellows ...

Rah! Rah! Rah!

ARNOLD

Long may we cherish thee

Faithful we'll be.

Clinton, oh, Clinton

For you and me ...

Da-da-da-da-da ...

Crash through that line of blue

And send the backs around the end.

EDDIE

There he goes with those fullbacks

again.

ARNOLD

Rah! Rah! Rah!

DISSOLVE TO:

KENNETH

Where we going? Eddie's place to

see movies?

ARNOLD

What movies?

EDDIE

Boy, just wait till you see these

movies! Hey, Charlie, hey Charlie ...

CHARLIE

What?

EDDIE

(indicating the

young woman)

Who's your beautiful friend, Charlie?

CHARLIE

(to the girl)

Excuse me. My friend down there

wants to know who you are.

THE EXISTENTIALIST

(with a Mona Lisa smile)

Where are you all from, out-of-town?

CHARLIE

Indiana.

(turning to

the others)

Isn't that right, fellers? We're

from Indiana, right?

EDDIE

Indiana! Indiana, man!

CHARLIE

(to The Existentialist)

We're from the Hoosier State, ma'am...

WALTER

Terre Haute! We're from Terre Haute!

CHARLIE

(to The Existentialist)

We're from Terre Haute, and we've

come to the big city looking for a

good time, and we just don't know

what to do with ourselves, ma'am.

EDDIE

(to Walter)

Look at that Charlie operate.

THE EXISTENTIALIST

Must be a convention in town.

CHARLIE

We've just come off the ranch there,

honey, and we're just raring. Is

that right, men? Are we raring?

EDDIE

We're raring, boy, we're raring!

KENNETH

(beside himself

with laughter)

Hey, Charlie, cut it out, will you?

CHARLIE

(chugging along behind

The Existentialist)

We're down here in Greenwich Village

looking for some wild bohemians. Do

you happen to know any wild

bohemians?

THE EXISTENTIALIST

All right, fellows, enough's enough,

huh?

CHARLIE

(hurrying along after

The Existentialist)

I'm something of a poet myself,

ma'am. Many's the long night in the

bunkhouse where I sat by myself and

wrote by the flickering light of a

kerosene lamp. Could I read you some

of my poems, ma'am? I know they

ain't much, but they're from the

heart, ma'am.

THE EXISTENTIALIST

You have a sense of humor, don't you?

EDDIE

(to Charlie)

You're going great, man, don't stop

now.

EDDIE

(to The Existentialist)

Where are you going, honey?

EDDIE

(to The Existentialist)

What's going on in there, honey?

THE EXISTENTIALIST

(patiently bored)

There's a party going on. I'm not sure

I'm invited myself, so I can't really

invite you.

EDDIE

Sure you can.

THE HOSTESS

How nice to see you, darling. Who

are your friends?

THE EXISTENTIALIST

I haven't the vaguest idea. I was

ambushed crossing Greenwich Avenue

by a tribe of the Terre Haute

Kiwanis.

THE HOSTESS

(she waves a vague

hand in a sort of

shooing motion at

the five men on

the sidewalk)

Go away, you men. Go back to the

Biltmore Hotel and put on your red

caps.

EDDIE

I always thought you city people

were more hospitable to us poor

farm boys.

CHARLIE

(to The Existentialist,

smiling amiably)

I'm sorry, miss. A friend of ours is

getting married here, and we're just

horsing around.

THE EXISTENTIALIST

Why don't you come back after you

get rid of your friends.

EDDIE

He'll be back!

EDDIE

(to Charlie)

Man, she likes you, man!

THE HOSTESS

Now, you boys go away.

EDDIE

Well, what do you say, men, are we

going to this party, or aren't we?

CHARLIE

(laughing)

Come on, Eddie. I thought you had

some movies you want to show us.

EDDIE

What do you want to see movies for?

You got the real thing right here.

CHARLIE

(laughing)

Eddie, we're married men here.

EDDIE

Come on, let's crash this party.

I've been to these Greenwich Village

parties. Man, they're wild.

KENNETH

Come on, Eddie, let's go up to your

place, see these movies.

EDDIE

(coming reluctantly

back to the others,

says to Charlie)

Man, you were going strong with that

girl. You could have scored. She's

just waiting for you. Go in after

her.

KENNETH

Come on, Eddie. Let's go see the

movies.

EDDIE

(to the others)

All right, I live about three blocks

down. You guys want to see movies,

all right, let's go see movies.

DISSOLVE TO:

ARNOLD

... we're moving in with her mother

and father. I don't know if that's

such a good idea. What do you think?

We haven't got an apartment yet, and

we figure we'll live a year with her

folks, save on the rent, see?

KENNETH

Anybody want a bottle of beer?

ARNOLD

(to Eddie)

She's a widow, and that bothers me a

little. I don't know why. She's two

years older than me. I don't know if

you know that. Her husband got killed

in Korea. She's a cousin of mine, you

know.

KENNETH

(moving into

the living room)

Who wants a bottle of beer?

CHARLIE

I'll take a bottle.

WALTER

Yeah, give me one.

ARNOLD

A third cousin, something like that.

It's not good for cousins to marry,

is it? What do you think of her? I

know she's not terribly pretty, but

I mean ...

EDDIE

(muttering imprecations

at the projector)

Arnold, leave me alone a minute,

will you?

ARNOLD

Sure.

(turns to the others in

living room, plants a

huge smile on his face)

Well, I'm getting married Sunday.

KENNETH

Having fun, Walter?

WALTER

Fun. A bunch of grown men sitting

around waiting to look at college

boy pictures.

ARNOLD

I swear, I never thought two months

ago I was ever going to get married.

I still don't know how it happened....

EDDIE

Hey, somebody turn off the lights.

CHARLIE

Hey, you know, you've got a nice

place here.

ARNOLD

I was just taking her out. I didn't

know it was so serious.

EDDIE

Arnold, get out of the way, will

you?

ARNOLD

Oh, sure.

ARNOLD

... We're sitting in the car, so she

says: "Well, Arnold, we've been

going together six months now. I

think it's time we decided whether

we were being serious."

WALTER

Hey, Eddie, you got it on the window.

ARNOLD

I didn't know it was so serious. I

didn't even know we were going

together. I just took her out every

now and then.

CHARLIE

Arnold, you're funny.

EDDIE

Turn on the lights again, will you,

Walter.

WALTER

What's the matter?

EDDIE

I forgot to loop it over this loop

thing.

CHARLIE

Oh, for crying out loud.

ARNOLD

(small panic)

I can't even remember what she looks

like! I just saw her this afternoon!

KENNETH

Arnold, have a bottle of beer. It's

not so terrible.

ARNOLD

Boy, I tell you. It's for the rest

of your life when you get married.

This is a big decision to make.

WALTER

Does anybody seriously want to see

these movies?

ARNOLD

I could be making a serious mistake.

EDDIE

Arnold, you're in the way again.

Come on now. All right, put off the

lights.

KENNETH

Here we go.

EDDIE

Hey, Arnold, if this is the one I

think it is, there's one part here I

want you to see.

WALTER

(a picture of determined

boredom, but putting on

his glasses)

This is for kids.

CHARLIE

Says he -- putting on his glasses.

KENNETH

"The Baseball Game." That's a nice

title, don't you think?

EDDIE

This is the one, Arnold. There's a

guy in here who looks just like

Arnold.

KENNETH

Hey, she's not bad. Usually, the

girls in these things look like

dinosaurs.

WALTER

(his eyes glued

to the screen)

A bunch of grown men ...

EDDIE

I got these pictures off my dentist.

I don't know where be got them.

There you are, Arnold, that's you.

CHARLIE

Yeah, it does look like Arnold.

EDDIE

Doesn't that look like Arnold?

KENNETH

Who's looking at the guy?

CHARLIE

Arnold, you've got a great career

ahead of you.

KENNETH

That girl looks like the girl

Charlie picked up just before.

EDDIE

Probably is.

WALTER

That fellow there is not a bad actor.

CHARLIE

Actor. You could play that part

pretty easy yourself.

KENNETH

I think the Daily News gave this one

four stars.

EDDIE

I'd like to see this in Three-D.

WALTER

Well, I'll just watch one of them.

Then, I think I'll just go home.

DISSOLVE TO:

HELEN

Hiya, Julie. I was beginning to

think you weren't coming.

JULIE

(coming in)

I was at my mother's house. Did they

call you? They said they were going

to call you.

HELEN

Yeah, your mother was very sweet.

JULIE

You should have seen my father. I

said, "Pa, you have another

grandchild coming." So he said,

"Who?" So I said, "Charlie." So he

said, "That little Helen?" So I said,

"If it isn't that little Helen,

Charlie better leave town." So out

came the beer. Well, they've been

after Charlie to have a baby for a

long time now. I said, "Pa, leave

him alone. Let him get established

before he saddles himself with a

baby." Anyway, I want you to know

joy reigns supreme in your in-laws'

house.

(she moves into

the kitchen)

How's Charlie taking it?

HELEN

(following her

into the kitchen)

Listen, let me make you a cup of

tea or something.

JULIE

No, no, I've been drinking beer for

the last two hours, celebrating your

baby.

HELEN

Soda, anything like that?

JULIE

No, honey, you go on with your wash.

Is that what you're doing?

(she sits)

When I had my first baby, Mike was

ashamed to be seen on the streets

with me. Well, listen, he was

interning at the time. We needed a

baby like a hole in the head. That's

why he's a general practitioner now,

because of that baby. He was

studying to be a surgeon. He

absolutely refused to admit I was

pregnant. Even in my ninth month,

and I was as big as a house. He

used to walk ten paces in front of

me in the street like he didn't

know who that woman with the belly

was. Where is Charlie anyway?

HELEN

I told you he--

JULIE

Oh, yeah. I wouldn't let my Mike go

on a bachelor party.

HELEN

(turning back

to her wash)

What are they going to do, get a

little drunk?

JULIE

Are you kidding? What do you think

these bachelor parties are for,

bachelors? This is for the married

men. It's a good excuse to get

drunk and find some girls.

HELEN

Can you picture Charlie getting

drunk and picking up a girl?

Charlie's old sobersides. You

should have seen what I went through

to get him to make a pass at me.

He's so sweet. Nobody knows how

really sweet he is, he's so quiet

all the time. My brother died in

September, he used to stay up with

me till three, four o'clock every

night. I used to cry all night, and

he used to sit on the bed and talk

with me. I used to look at him

talking there, and I used to think:

"What would I do without this sweet

man here? I'd go crazy." You know,

you like to be a little cynical

sometimes, Julie.

JULIE

Wait'll you've been married eleven

years.

HELEN

You like to talk about all the

affairs everybody's husband is

having. Do you know actually one

woman whose husband is actually

playing around?

JULIE

Wait'll you've been married eleven

years.

JULIE

(looking down)

Wait'll Charlie gets to be forty-two.

My Mike's having an affair right now

with one of his patients right now.

We don't talk about it -- don't you,

either, not even to Charlie. But

Mike knows I know about it. I even

know the patient. A married woman

with a hyperthyroid problem. My

Mike's a good doctor with a pretty

good practice. The kids are crazy

about him. But every now and then

he has to go out and get involved

with a woman.

JULIE

Listen, I will take a cup of tea if

you've got one.

HELEN

(quite shocked)

You're kidding, aren't you?

JULIE

(finds the box

of tea bags)

Would I kid about something like

that?

JULIE

I don't know why I told you. Don't

tell anybody, not even Charlie. I

don't want the family to know. But

this woman isn't the first one. I

know that much. About three years

ago, the doorbell rings. I open the

door. There's a man there. He says:

"Tell your husband to stay away from

my sister." How would you like to

open the door and have somebody say

that to you? I cried for two weeks.

I don't know what to do about it,

Helen. Should I bring it out in the

open with Mike or should I just keep

my mouth shut like the other time?

Because he's not going to leave me.

Even if he doesn't care about me,

he has his kids to think about. We

married too young. That was our big

mistake. We married too young.

JULIE

(her voice rising just

a little from the

suppressed emotion

within her)

We should have waited till he

finished his internship. What kind

of married life is that? Twenty-two

dollars a month he was earning.

Every other day, he had to sleep in

the hospital. The first two years of

our marriage, we didn't even see

each other. And then I'm pregnant.

He had to quit, what do you think?

He wanted to be a surgeon, he wound

up being a G.P. From that day he

hated me. I had two other children

by him, but he hated me. He told me

in just so many words. Why do you

think I kept telling you, Helen, why

do you think I kept telling you:

"Don't have a baby till Charlie finds

himself."

(suddenly cries out)

It hurts! Even after eleven years,

it hurts!

HELEN

Are you all right, Julie?

JULIE

(muttering)

I'm all right. I'm all right.

DISSOLVE TO:

WALTER

Is that the last one?

EDDIE

Yeah.

WALTER

Ah, you've seen one, you've seen

them all.

KENNETH

Yeah, they're all alike.

CHARLIE

I don't know -- I think the first

one was all right.

WALTER

Yeah, I was so bored by the rest of

them. I nearly fell asleep during

the last one.

KENNETH

You in the habit of sleeping with

your eyes open?

CHARLIE

What time's it about, anybody know?

ARNOLD

(glancing at his watch)

I got a quarter to nine.

EDDIE

No, it's later than that, about a

quarter after.

WALTER

(after a moment)

Ah, you see one, you've seen them

all.

WALTER

(after a moment)

So that's the last one you've got to

show us, Eddie?

EDDIE

Yeah. You want to run them backwards?

KENNETH

I wonder where they get the girls to

make these movies?

WALTER

Might as well go home, I guess.

KENNETH

Yeah.

WALTER

(after a moment)

Life is short.

EDDIE

(hunched over

the projector,

dismantling it)

You guys feel like going down to

have a drink for Arnold?

WALTER

Yeah! What do you say? One last

drink for Arnold!

CHARLIE

Okay with me.

KENNETH

(unwinding himself

from his slouched

position on a chair)

You can say what you want to about

these pictures -- they're really

pretty bad -- but they get you.

ARNOLD

Don't you think we ought to clean up

the place?

EDDIE

No, I got a woman comes in.

WALTER

(grabbing up

his jacket)

I almost fell asleep during the

last one.

(he looks at

the others)

Well, what do you say, huh? Let's

go! One last drink!

DISSOLVE TO:

JULIE

... He's a boy, my Mike. Till the

day he dies, he'll never be more

than fifteen. Perpetual adolescence,

that's the curse of the professional

man. He spends his whole youth trying

to be a doctor, a lawyer, an

accountant. Then he spends the rest

of his life looking for the fun he

should have had when he was a boy.

HELEN

Oh, I know. Charlie and I hardly

even see each other.

JULIE

It's very hard on the wife, Helen.

These are the years when you should

be building your marriage. Instead,

you grow away from each other. I've

seen it happen with my friends. In

the end, they have nice homes in New

Rochelle, and a maid, and their

maids are happier than they are. But

sometimes it does work. It can be

done, Helen. Encourage Charlie to

stay with his school because...

HELEN

Oh, I will, Julie ...

JULIE

... he's an ambitious boy ...

HELEN

... oh, it's not just he's

ambitious ...

JULIE

... and if he doesn't fulfill

himself, he'll resent you and your

baby the rest of his life.

HELEN

Oh, I don't want him to quit. He

loves accounting, Julie. I see him

sometimes, sitting over his homework.

He's got his ledgers out, and he's

adding up columns of figures as long

as his arm. And he's chuckling.

You'd think he was reading the

comics. He has a book there,

Business Law. How he can read it I

don't know. But I'll be watching

television or something, and he'll

come over, and he'll start telling

me about some fine legal point. I

don't know what he's talking about,

but it's enough for me to see how

excited it makes him. He loves it,

Julie. You can't take something like

that away from him. It's just --

it's just I feel we're not really

close any more. I mean, he comes

home from school, lots of times I'm

asleep already. And, when I do see

him, he seems all involved with

himself. He looks at me sometimes as

if I were a stranger to him, and I

feel sometimes I am. I'm afraid of

that, Julie.

JULIE

Then get rid of the baby.

JULIE

If I had it to do again, believe me,

that's what I would do.

HELEN

(slowly becoming aware

of the depth of what

they are talking about)

You don't mean that, Julie.

JULIE

Yes, I do. My children are the only

things in my life now, but I would

rather have a husband.

HELEN

I wouldn't even think about it.

JULIE

That's what I said, too.

HELEN

Let's not even think about it. If I

even mentioned it, he'd -- he'd hit

me, I think.

JULIE

All right.

HELEN

I want this baby, Julie. I've wanted

this baby for a long time. It's the

only thing I've ever asked of

Charlie. If I mentioned that to him

-- I don't know what he'd do.

HELEN

(on phone)

Hello.... Hello, Charlie, where are

you calling from? ... You sound like

you're having a nice time.... Oh,

you're having a ball, huh? ... Well,

what time do you think you'll be

coming home?

CHARLIE

(on phone)

Well, that's what I wanted to call

you about, honey. I think a couple

of the guys are cutting out now. I

think Kennie's going home. But I was

wondering if you wanted me home for

any special reason.

HELEN

(on phone)

Just a minute, Charlie....

HELEN

(to Julie)

Excuse me a minute, Julie. It's

Charlie....

HELEN

(on phone)

Charlie? ...

(sits)

Charlie, come on home now.... No, I

feel all right. I just miss you.

Julie's here, and we were talking

about you, and I just miss you....

Ah, come on....

(frowns a little)

Well, no, if you're having such a

good time, stay out and enjoy

yourself.... No, Charlie, I don't

want you to come home if you're

having a good time.... I'm not

lonely. Julie's here. We're talking.

I was washing some things.... I

know, that's what I told you this

morning. You've finally got a night

off for yourself. I don't want you

to feel guilty about it....

Charlie, do you love me? ... You

sound angry.... No, come home any

time you want....

(she wets her

lips nervously)

Charlie ...

(she lets her head

sink down onto the

palm of her free hand)

Charlie, there's no girls at this

party, are there? ... I'm not

checking up on you, Charlie. I just

miss you, that's all.... All right,

Charlie, please, I don't want to

argue with you. Julie's in the

living room. ... All right, have a

good time, stay out as long as you

want.... All right, Charlie, good-

bye.

CHARLIE

The party breaking up?

KENNETH

(pushing into

the men's room)

I don't know. I'm going home. You

going home?

CHARLIE

Yeah, I think so.

CHARLIE

(frowning)

You love your wife, Kennie?

KENNETH'S VOICE

(off)

Well, I've been married six years.

I've got two kids that keep me awake

all night long. Every Sunday, we go

out driving in Long Island looking

for a house that's going to take

one, probably two mortgages. I better

love my wife.

CHARLIE

I don't feel like going home. Are

you going? Hang around, Kennie. It's

only about nine thirty, ten.

KENNETH

It's after ten. It's about ten after

ten.

KENNETH

The party's getting a little wild in

there anyway. Eddie and Walter got

poor Arnold nailed in there, they're

trying to talk him into getting a

girl. This party's going to wind up

in a joint, let me tell you. This is

a good time to blow.

CHARLIE

(frowning)

Yeah.... I should have gone to class

tonight. I'm paying twenty bucks a

credit. The least I can do is go to

class.

CHARLIE

I take one night off, I can't even

enjoy myself. Did you know Eddie

went back to Europe?

KENNETH

No, I didn't know that.

CHARLIE

He was telling me he lived in Paris

for three months. I'd like to do

that!

KENNETH

What's the matter?

CHARLIE

I'm going to quit. What am I

killing myself for?

KENNETH

Quit what?

CHARLIE

Quit night school. Tonight was the

first laughs I've had in years. I

can't remember the last time I had

so much fun. Look what I'm missing.

I'm making a pretty good living. I

can support a wife and baby on what

I make. I'm going to quit! I mean

it. I'm going to quit. Boy, what a

time to have a baby.

KENNETH

You don't have to quit school

because you're having a baby,

Charlie. There are lots of guys go

to night school with two, three

kids.

CHARLIE

You ought to meet some of these guys.

They're just grinding their lives

away. It's an obsession with some of

these guys. I mean, what's the point?

So I'll go five more years to night

school. So I'll get my degree. So

I'll get a job as a junior accountant

for three years at seventy-five bucks

a week. I'm making better than that

now. And then it just starts. The

CPA exams. By the time I'm fifty, I

can start living. At this point, I

get a heart attack and an ulcer, and

they bury me in the ground, and they

say: "That was Charlie Samson, the

man who didn't see a movie in fifty

years." Why go through all that?

I'll quit. I feel so mad right now,

you better keep an eye on me, Kennie,

because I'm going to wind up punching

somebody.

KENNETH

Come on, let's go home.

CHARLIE

What do I want to go home for?

KENNETH

You're in a lousy mood.

KENNETH

(after a moment)

Charlie, go home. I can see you're

going to get fried tonight and wind

up picking up a tramp and you're

going to wake up in the morning

feeling like two-bits.

CHARLIE

It'd be a profit.

KENNETH

Charlie, about five years ago, I

went without a job for seven months.

Alice was carrying our first baby.

We were living on money I borrowed

from my brother. I don't know if you

remember me in those days, but it

was rough. I used to go out every

night, put a load on, and make a

pass at any girl who looked at me.

And I mean any. Big, tall, short,

fat, anything. Well, one night I

picked up some tomato somewheres,

and we were sitting in a bar or

somewheres, and I kept calling her

Alice all night. So she says to me:

"My name ain't Alice. Who's Alice?"

So I said: "Alice is my wife," and

I got up and I went home.

CHARLIE

What does that mean?

KENNETH

I don't know. I had a point when I

started telling that story.

CHARLIE

I'm not looking for another woman.

KENNETH

Yes, you are, Charlie. You may not

know it, but you are. So go on home,

Charlie, before you get any drunker

than you are. Charlie, you start

messing with other women, something

goes. It'll kill your marriage.

It'll kill your wife. It'll just

kill her. What my wife went through

-- well, I don't even want to

remember it. It's never the same

with your wife again, Charlie.

CHARLIE

I'm not looking for any woman.

KENNETH

I think what I was trying to say

was you stick with your night school.

Some guys have to make peace with

themselves that they're never going

to amount to too much. A guy like me.

Once I made that peace with myself,

I found out it doesn't really matter

what you amount to. I got a nice

wife and two children I complain

about all the time, but if anything

ever happened to either one of them,

I think I'd die. But you don't have

to make that kind of peace, and

you'd be crazy to settle for less

than what you want. You want

something, Charlie. I think that's

wonderful.

(Charlie's eyes go

toward Kenneth)

You're a little drunk now, and

you're fed up to the teeth.

Everybody gets fed up, Charlie. You

stick with it. You're going to be all

right.

CHARLIE

(touched)

You're a nice guy, Kennie.

KENNETH

Sure. You're a nice guy too.

YOUNG MAN

Watch it -- will you, Mac?

CHARLIE

Wait a minute.... What are you, a

wise guy?

KENNETH

Come on, Charlie, let's go home.

CHARLIE

I'm just about drunk enough right

now to bust somebody right in the

nose.

EDDIE

(to Walter)

... Come on, will you? Look Walter,

it's just the shank of the evening!

What's so special in your home? You

got a floor show every night? Who

are you married to, Jayne Mansfield?

Come on, it's not even half past

ten!

KENNETH

(smiling amiably)

We got to get up tomorrow, go to

work, Eddie.

EDDIE

We're just starting! We got to get

Arnold a girl yet!

ARNOLD

Eddie, please ...

EDDIE

That's the whole point to a bachelor

party! You got to get the guy a girl!

ARNOLD

Look, fellows, it's been a nice

clean party ...

KENNETH

Well, Arnold, since I'm not going to

see you again before the wedding,

congratulations and best wishes in

the coming future to both you and

the bride.

ARNOLD

Thanks a lot, Kennie....

EDDIE

You're not going, are you, Charlie?

We're just starting! We got to get

Arnold a girl yet!

ARNOLD

(to Kenneth)

I want to thank you for the

presents, Kennie....

CHARLIE

...No, I'll stick around another

hour or so....

EDDIE

... That's my boy....

ARNOLD

(to Kenneth, who is

looking at Charlie)

... Honestly, I never expected any

presents....

KENNETH

(to Charlie)

... Aren't you coming home? ...

CHARLIE

... What for? Sit around talking to

my sister Julie? ...

ARNOLD

(standing)

... I want to thank all you

fellows ...

EDDIE

All right, stop thanking them,

Arnold. They just gave you a party,

they didn't elect you President.

ARNOLD

... This has been one of the nicest

nights of my life....

CHARLIE

Let's go someplace ... let's go to

a nightclub.

EDDIE

That's great with me.

CHARLIE

Come on, Ken.

ARNOLD

Thanks a lot.

KENNETH

... Well, listen, fellows, I'm

cutting out.... Good night, Walter,

Eddie.

(to Charlie)

... You coming, Charlie? ...

CHARLIE

... No, I'll kill another hour....

Come on, Kennie....

KENNETH

No, you go ahead. I'll see you in

the morning, Charlie.

CHARLIE

Okay, I'll see you.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

ARNOLD

So what do you think of my girl,

Eddie? You met her. Be honest with

me. Tell me the truth. I had the

feeling you didn't like her.

EDDIE

Come on, come on, Arnold. What do

you want from me.

ARNOLD

Listen, Charlie, I'd like to ask you

a little advice. I mean, you're a

married man. This girl, I'm supposed

to marry, she's all right, but I'm

not really attracted to her, you

know what I mean? That's important,

isn't it? I kissed her a couple of

times, but I ... I don't know why

I'm getting married, Charlie.

CHARLIE

What did you say, Arnold?

ARNOLD

I said, I don't know why I'm getting

married. I did pretty good for

thirty-two years without getting

married. I get along fine at home.

My mother's a good cook. I have a

nice life. What do I want to break

it all up for?

CHARLIE

Well, Arnold, everybody feels that

way before they get married.

ARNOLD

Yeah? Did I ever show you a picture

of my girl?

CHARLIE

No, you didn't, Arnold.

ARNOLD

Do you want to see a picture?

CHARLIE

Sure.

ARNOLD

I want you to give me your honest

impression, Charlie. She isn't much,

is she?

CHARLIE

I can't see much in this light, but

she looks like a nice pretty girl.

ARNOLD

Well, I wouldn't say that. We were

matched up, you know. The families

kind of agreed on it. I was brought

over to her by my mother and father.

That's how I met her. She's some

kind of tenth cousin. She's all

right. She's quiet. I kissed her a

couple of times. She just sat there

and I kissed her. I think she

expected more. She even asked me

that. She said to me: "Are you

afraid of me?" I really don't go out

with women much. You know. Don't

tell nobody this, Charlie, but you

aren't going to believe this, but I

never ... I mean, you wouldn't

believe that a guy of my age, I

never ... Don't tell anybody I ever

told you this, but I never-- I mean,

Charlie, she's a widow. She's been

married already -- she's going to

expect a lot -- and I never ----

What do you think I ought to do?

CHARLIE

What do you mean, Arnold?

ARNOLD

I mean, you think I ought to marry

her?

CHARLIE

Well, Arnold, even if I knew the

girl, I wouldn't answer that

question. I may not like her, but

she may be fine for you.

ARNOLD

Because I'm thinking of calling the

whole thing off.

CHARLIE

It's kind of late for that, isn't

it?

ARNOLD

I'm scared stiff, Charlie.

CHARLIE

What are you scared about?

ARNOLD

I'm not much of a talker, and she's

one of those quiet ones. What are

you supposed to do with your wife?

I mean, most of the time.

CHARLIE

(has to think)

Most of the time, Arnold, you don't

even see her. You're away working.

You come home, she fixes you supper.

Then one of you washes the dishes.

Then if you're not tired, you can go

to the movies or visit somebody. Or

you watch teevee.

ARNOLD

I do that now with my mother.

CHARLIE

(scowling)

I don't know what there is to

marriage. I suppose it's to have

kids.

ARNOLD

So what do you think I ought to do?

You think I ought to go through with

this marriage?

CHARLIE

(angry)

Arnold, I can't answer that!

DISSOLVE TO:

EDDIE

I think we've got one for you,

Arnold.

ARNOLD

One what?

ARNOLD

Ah, come on, Eddie.

EDDIE

She ain't bad.

CHARLIE

(calling from a

few paces down)

What's the matter?

EDDIE

We've got a live one.

ARNOLD

(starting to walk)

Come on, let's go.

EDDIE

Arnold, for Pete's sake.

CHARLIE

Ah, leave him alone! He doesn't want

to.

EDDIE

Come on. We've been walking around

all night here -- are you a man, or

ain't you?

ARNOLD

All right, all right.

THE WOMAN

(not looking up)

I don't know who you fellows think

I am, but you fellows have the

wrong idea about me.

EDDIE

Yeah, I know. Arnold, see that bar

down the corner. That's where we'll

be.

THE WOMAN

I'm afraid you fellows have the

wrong idea about me.

ARNOLD

She says we have the wrong idea.

CHARLIE

Ah, leave him alone.

THE WOMAN

You fellows are working under a

misconception.

EDDIE

We'll be in the bar, Arnold.

CHARLIE

You all right, Arnold?

ARNOLD

Yeah, I'm all right, it's just ...

THE WOMAN

Look, I'm just sitting here, fellows.

Did I say anything? I was just

sitting here.

ARNOLD

You want to come with me, Charlie?

CHARLIE

No, Arnold.

CHARLIE

You want me to? All right. I'll go

up with you.

EDDIE

(from halfway down

the street)

Where you going, Charlie?

CHARLIE

I'll go up with him. Moral support.

EDDIE

What the---- we'll all go with you.

EDDIE

(walks back to fellows)

We'll be down at the bar.

THE WOMAN

(as she goes)

Ssshhh....

CHARLIE

Hey, Arnold, you don't have to go

through with this.

ARNOLD

I think I should.

CHARLIE

I'll wait out here for you, okay?

THE WOMAN

Listen, I don't want you to think I

don't have a job. I got a job. I

work.

THE WOMAN

What's the matter?

THE WOMAN

Are you afraid of me?

THE WOMAN

(getting a

little shrill)

What's the matter? Hey. Hey, you.

Hey, you, what's the matter?

CHARLIE

Let's go.

(to The Woman)

What's the trouble?

THE WOMAN

I don't know. Ask him. What's the

matter? Hey, you. You, what's the

matter?

CHARLIE

Go back inside.... All right, all

right.

THE WOMAN

How about that, huh?

CHARLIE

What happened, Arnold?

ARNOLD

I don't know. I'm just scared.

CHARLIE

Yeah, I don't blame you, I'd be

scared too like this. I don't know

why we dragged you up here in the

first place. It's a barbaric custom.

Come on.

ARNOLD

Don't tell Eddie.

CHARLIE

No I won't, Arnold.

ARNOLD

Why don't we just sit here for ten

minutes or so?

CHARLIE

All right, Arnold.

ARNOLD

Don't ever tell anybody.

CHARLIE

It's nothing to be ashamed of.

ARNOLD

Please, Charlie.

CHARLIE

I won't tell anybody.

MAN'S VOICE

Anything wrong down there?

CHARLIE

(calling back)

No. No. Nothing wrong.

EDDIE

Hey Walter -- you know what we

ought to do, don't you? We ought to

go to that party. Remember that girl

Charlie picked up on Tenth Street?

WALTER

I'm going to die, do you know that?

EDDIE

Not tonight, Walter. Tonight you're

going to live. Ah, these things are

fixed.

(crosses to bar)

I'm down to my last buck. Got any

money on you?

EDDIE

(to Charlie)

Hey!

(to Arnold)

How'd it go, lover?

(Arnold smiles a

mysterious smile,

pregnant with

sensual meaning)

Hey, Charlie, let's go to this party.

It's only twelve o'clock. Oh, these

parties are mad, man. All the women

wear pajamas, and all the men wear

beards. Everybody sits on the floor.

Arnold, you got any money? I spent

my last buck on those drinks. How

about you, Charlie?

ARNOLD

(assessing his assets)

I got a little over a buck.

EDDIE

What are we, all out? So let's go to

this party then.

(punches Charlie's arm)

Hey, Charlie, come on.

CHARLIE

(himself sullen and angry)

Cut it out.

EDDIE

You can have that girl you picked up

on Tenth Street. Come on.... All

right, you married men want to be so

married that's all right with me.

But I'd like to see some women

tonight.

(punching Charlie's

arm with more hostility

than he knows)

Come on.

CHARLIE

Lay off.

EDDIE

I'd like to see some women tonight,

you know. Do you mind?

CHARLIE

Cut it out, Eddie. You keep punching

me, I swear I'm going to belt you

one.

EDDIE

What's the matter with you?

ARNOLD

All right, all right, fellows.

EDDIE

Look, don't get so tough with me,

Charlie.

ARNOLD

All right, all right, come on.

CHARLIE

(angry)

I don't want to see any other women!

EDDIE

(just as angry)

All right! Go on home! Who's holding

you?! You want to call it a night?

Because I'm tired of grousing from

one bar to another. You guys go home,

and I'll go about my merry way. All

right? And don't get so tough with

me.

CHARLIE

Well, don't poke me.

ARNOLD

(turning Charlie

back to his seat)

Come on, let's go ... gee ...

CHARLIE

(mutters)

You mess around with other women, it

kills your wife and it kills your

marriage.

EDDIE

All right, you guys go home, and

I'll go on my merry way.

(gets to the door,

pauses, then turns,

his sudden hot temper

gone as quickly as

it had come)

Hey, you guys, you guys want to go

to a nutty night club, look at the

nuts? There's a nutty night club

over on Second Avenue. You know

what we can do? Charlie, you live in

Stuyvesant Town, don't you?

CHARLIE

Yeah.

EDDIE

You know what we can do? We'll take

the crosstown. We'll go over to

Charlie's house, he'll get some

money, and we'll go to this nutty

night club. It's right down on

Second Avenue. You got any money

home, Charlie?

CHARLIE

What do you say, Arnold? You want to

go?

EDDIE

Charlie, get Walter.

CHARLIE

Come on, Walter....

WALTER

I'm going to die, you know what I

mean?

DISSOLVE TO:

WALTER

(mumbling)

Excuse me ... excuse me ...

(turns his blurred

attention to Charlie,

who, alone of the

three, seems painfully

interested in what

Walter is talking

about)

So what'll I do? I mean, he says,

I'm going to die. I mean, the man's

a specialist. He says: "Go to

Arizona, go to Colorado," he says.

"You got to get out of New York or

you're going to die." He tells my

wife, the stupid idiot. My wife

cried all night. I'm going to die,

you know that? You understand that?

I'm going to die? You know what an

asthma attack is like? Your heart

starts beating like a drum! I passed

out the last time!

CHARLIE

(deeply compassionate)

Walter, why don't you just quit the

job and pack your bags and get out

of here?

WALTER

(getting the words out)

I can't quit. Don't you understand?

You don't understand. I can't quit!

I got a fourteen-year-old girl, I

don't know what time she comes in at

night any more. She's so wild, these

kids. I got a nineteen-year-old boy

in college; he's going to be a

doctor if I have to die. He's not

going to quit school. You hear me!

I worked hard to put that kid in

school! I don't care if I die! I

don't care! What am I going to do

in Arizona? Who wants me? Who's

going to give me a job? What kind

of a job am I going to get? I'm

forty-eight years old. They don't

want no forty-eight-year-old

bookkeeper. They got machines from

IBM. You ever been up on the ninth

floor? You ever see all those IBM

machines? What am I going to do out

in Arizona? You look in the Help

Wanted lately? You see any jobs

listed for Bookkeeper, Male? What

are you talking about? Do you know

what you're talking about?

CHARLIE

Easy, Walter.

WALTER

(flinging Charlie's

hand aside)

Take your hand off me. You don't

know nothing! You're just a kid!

You don't know! I've seen death,

kid. I've seen it, boy. I know what

it looks like.

(he staggers away a

few paces down the

aisle, stumbles over

the man's toe again)

Excuse me.... Forty-eight years old

and so what? What does it mean? What

happened? What have I got? What did

I make? Who needs me? So this is it.

A man's life, nothing. Worry about

being sick, worry about making money,

worry about your wife, worry about

your kids, and you're on your way to

the grave from the day you're born.

The days drag on, and the years fly

by, and so what?

(cries out to

the whole world)

What is it all about? Will you tell

me?

WALTER

Life is nothing! It's a gag! It's a

joke! It's a mortgage! It's a

bankrupt! It's a lot of noise over

nothing! Sound and fury! Isn't that

what the man said? What do you

think, I never read a book? I read a

book! Don't worry! I was a bright

kid! Everybody thought I was going

to be the first Catholic to be

President! Where did it all go?!

WALTER

(mumbling)

Where did it all go?

EDDIE

(looking out,

in a low voice)

Where are we, Third Avenue?

ARNOLD

(low voice)

Where are we getting off? Next stop?

CHARLIE

(low voice)

Yeah.

WALTER

(muttering)

I'm going home.

CHARLIE

(looking up)

What did you say, Walter?

WALTER

I'm going home.

CHARLIE

(standing)

Walter, where are you going? Come

here ...

EDDIE

(standing)

What, did Walter get out?

CHARLIE

(calling through

the open window)

Walter, stay there, we'll come back

on the next train. Stay there.

ARNOLD

Poor Walter, huh?

CHARLIE

(bellowing through

the window)

Walter! ...

EDDIE

(standing)

He'll be all right, Charlie. God

protects drunks and fools.

CHARLIE

Walter! Grab a cab if you're going

home!

EDDIE

(sits)

Poor Walter, I didn't know he was so

sick. I thought there was something

wrong with him, though. He's been

out so much.

ARNOLD

(sitting drunkenly down)

I didn't know he was so sick.

CHARLIE

That's me in fifteen years.

DISSOLVE TO:

CHARLIE

That's where I live.

EDDIE

Which one?

CHARLIE

In the back there. You can't see it

from here.

EDDIE

It looks like a state hospital.

CHARLIE

It looks like a prison.

EDDIE

Yeah, it does look a little like a

prison.

CHARLIE

(suddenly)

I'm going home.

EDDIE

(calling after him)

Hey, Charlie ...

EDDIE

Hey, Charlie! What about the money?

Have you got ten bucks?

CHARLIE

(after a moment)

All right, if you want to walk me to

the house, I'll get you ten bucks.

DISSOLVE TO:

CHARLIE

(mutters)

I'll be right out.

HELEN

Hiya, have a nice time?

CHARLIE

I'm taking ten bucks. A couple of

the guys are waiting outside. I

promised them I'd loan them ten

bucks.

HELEN

Sure.

CHARLIE

(looking at the set)

Tomorrow's payday. I'll get it back

tomorrow.

HELEN

It's in the drawer.

HELEN

What's the matter, Charlie?

CHARLIE

I don't know.

HELEN

It's not so bad, Charlie.

CHARLIE

I know. I know.

CHARLIE

(eyes wide open

but unseeing)

I don't know what's the matter with

me, I keep getting so depressed. I'm

going to quit night school, Helen.

My nerves are shot.

CHARLIE

Those guys are waiting outside. I

better give them their money.

HELEN

Charlie ... Maybe I shouldn't have

the baby?

CHARLIE

What do you mean? ...

CHARLIE

Isn't that dangerous? ... Well, I

don't know ... maybe ... Well, you

brought it up.

HELEN

(shocked -- after

a moment)

You really don't want this baby....

HELEN

You're my husband, Charlie. This is

your baby too. That doesn't mean

anything to you. For the first time

in our marriage I feel I can't

depend on you, Charlie -- I'm not

important to you.

(she has to stop

because she can no

longer trust her

voice. After a

moment she continues)

I could make my life sound hard, too,

Charlie. I work all day, I rush home,

I make you dinner. I sit home alone

four nights a week, I'm even alone

when you're here because when do I

see you? But it was easy for me

because I loved you. Do you think I

care whether you're an accountant or

a ditch digger, or even out of work?

All I ever wanted was you. And this

baby because it's you, too.

HELEN

(dully)

Leave me alone, Charlie.

CHARLIE

(looking out

the window)

I decided I'd quit school and ...

HELEN

I don't care ...

CHARLIE

I decided I'd quit school and come

home in the evenings like everybody

else and live a normal life.

HELEN

(staring at the

wall ahead of her)

I don't care what you do, Charlie.

CHARLIE

I don't care what I do either.

EDDIE

What took you so long? What did you

do, blow open the safe?

CHARLIE

(giving Eddie the

ten-dollar bill)

Here.

EDDIE

(taking it)

I'll give it to you tomorrow. I'll

see you in the morning, Charlie.

CHARLIE

I'll see you.

CHARLIE

Wait a minute. I'll go with you.

EDDIE

Let's go to that party -- we'll

have a ball!

DISSOLVE TO:

HOSTESS

I'm sure that's the police again.

HOSTESS

(beaming)

Are you coming to complain about the

noise?

EDDIE

Do we look like complainers?

HOSTESS

I don't know who you are, but come

in, come in. I don't know half the

people who are here tonight.

HOSTESS

The police have been here twice. The

first fellow was just adorable. We

gave him a drink, and he's upstairs

in a bedroom now, for all I know.

EDDIE

Is that right?

HOSTESS

If you want something to drink,

you'll just have to go into the

kitchen and get it yourself. The

place is just mad. Do you write,

paint or sing?

EDDIE

Everything.

CHARLIE

Boy, do you get invited to a party

like this or do you get committed?

YOUNG CHAP

I heard that. It's awfully funny.

EDDIE

Beat it.

EDDIE

This is going to be like shooting

ducks. Pick out your duck, men.

EDDIE

Hey, what's the matter, Charlie?

(squats down

beside Charlie)

CHARLIE

(without looking up)

Let's get out of here, Eddie.

EDDIE

The last time I saw you, you was

with that girl you picked up. What

happened?

CHARLIE

She's over there talking to that

old guy with the glasses.

CHARLIE

I didn't like her. She's one of

these real Greenwich Village phonies.

If I added up all the guys she told

me about, she must have had her

first boy friend when she was two

years old. Where are you going,

Eddie. Stick around a minute.

EDDIE

(who has stood)

I'm with that one over there -- not

bad, huh? I think she's a Communist.

I think she's trying to talk me into

joining the Party.

CHARLIE

How are you making out?

EDDIE

Not so hot. I may have to join.

CHARLIE

Hang around. Let's talk a bit.

EDDIE

I better get back. She's liable to

recruit somebody else.

CHARLIE

Where's Arnold?

EDDIE

He's in the kitchen. I think he's

out cold. I'll see you.

CHARLIE

Hey Arnold-- You okay, Arnold?

THE EXISTENTIALIST

That old man I was talking to before?

That's my landlord. About ten thirty

last night, someone began pounding on

my door. So I got up and opened the

door, and there was this white-haired

man with  a pince-nez standing there.

I said: "What do you want?" So he

said: "I'm the landlord, and I want

the rent." Well, I just looked at him

because the landlord I knew was a

Hungarian man named Frank, who was

crazy about me, and the issue of rent

never came up, you see. Well, it

turned out that this man with the

pince-nez had just bought the

building the day before and he kept

grabbing my arm and saying he wanted

the rent. Well, then I got the point,

of course. Well, meanwhile, a boy

named Bob I knew had come over. He's

engaged to a Javanese girl with

wonderful planes in her face who

lives at the International House.

But he's crazy about me and he drops

in about twice a week. Well,

meanwhile, my new landlord was

grabbing my arm and kept quoting

poetry to me which he was trying to

pass off as his own. He was an

absolute fraud. He scotched the

whole thing from Baudelaire. "Tu

mettrais." You know that one. Well,

he kept screaming about the rent --

I didn't like him, you know -- and I

called this boy named George who

used to live in Poughkeepsie when I

was going to Vassar, and he's crazy

about me. He lives in St. Luke's

place now, but he goes to

Poughkeepsie every Wednesday to see

his mother, he's got an Oedipus, so

that was out. Well, my new landlord

kept telling me how much he was in

love with me. I said: "How

existentialist can you get? You just

met me five minutes ago." He was

absolutely crazy about me.

CHARLIE

(resigned)

You have an apartment around here

somewheres?

(looks up to

second floor)

What's up there? What kind of rooms

are up there?

THE EXISTENTIALIST

So, I finally got to sleep around

six thirty....

CHARLIE

Come on, let's go.

THE EXISTENTIALIST

(wrenching her

arm away)

No! Oh, stop trying to be so

primitive.

THE EXISTENTIALIST

I find you very unpleasant.

THE EXISTENTIALIST

There's nothing upstairs.

(suddenly rises,

mumbles)

Oh, I don't care.

THE EXISTENTIALIST

So I finally got to sleep around six

thirty this morning. At nine thirty,

someone began pounding on my door

again. I got out of bed and opened

the door, and there was my landlord

with the pince-nez wearing a blue

silk kimono. "Oh, for heaven's

sakes," I said, "what do you want

now?" He said: "I'm the landlord,

and I want the rent." I said:

"You're an old man, go to sleep."

Then the phone rang. It was a boy

named Andrew I know who teaches

physics at Columbia University, and

he's insanely jealous. He's married

and has four children, but he keeps

badgering me to run away with him to

Nicaragua, throw up his professorship

and all that. Well, my landlord began

shouting some garbled Baudelaire at

the top of his lungs, and a little

Verlaine, and a little Huysmans. He

apparently has some kind of fetish

about French decadents. And

naturally, Andrew heard him, and he

got furious, and he said: "Who's that

I hear?" I said, "That's the

landlord." He said: "What does he

want?" I said: "He wants the rent."

Well, at this point, I felt like

chucking the whole business and

going back to Bessemer City and

going to work in my father's

hardware store.

THE EXISTENTIALIST

(muttering)

Just say you love me.

CHARLIE

What?

THE EXISTENTIALIST

Just say you love me. You don't have

to mean it.

THE EXISTENTIALIST

No, don't. ...

CHARLIE

What's the matter?

THE EXISTENTIALIST

Say you love me....

CHARLIE

Come on.

THE EXISTENTIALIST

Say you love me....

CHARLIE

Come on....

THE EXISTENTIALIST

No ...

CHARLIE

I love you! I love you!

THE EXISTENTIALIST

(content)

Look, maybe we ought to go someplace

else? I'm having a very tricky thing

going with my landlord and I don't

want him to see us leaving together.

So you know what you do? There's a

bar down the street. You go out the

door and turn to your right. You

know the one I mean?

CHARLIE

Yes, I know.

THE EXISTENTIALIST

Well, you go there and I'll be there

as fast as I can. Now, wait for me

now, because I can't stand being

alone at night. You'll like me. I'm

supposed to be very amusing. All

right?

CHARLIE

(calling down)

Hey, Eddie ...

CHARLIE

(muttering)

Eddie, I'm cutting out.

EDDIE

(standing, low voice)

Wait a minute, I'll go with you.

CHARLIE

I don't want to take you away from

your girl, Eddie.

EDDIE

Aah, this one lives out in Long

Island with her mother. What kind of

Communist is that? It'll take me a

half hour on the subway there and a

half hour back.

CHARLIE

(shrugs)

Where's Arnold? Still in the kitchen?

EDDIE

I guess so.

(to the girl)

I'll see you, next time I get to

Long Island.

EDDIE

(over Charlie's

shoulder)

Hey, Arnold, come on.

EDDIE

Well, it wasn't a bad party. We

killed a couple of hours anyway.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

EDDIE

... I mean, you can't compare the

two. This kid the Yankees have in

centerfield. Are you trying to tell

me he's a natural .368 hitter? What's

he normally hit, .310, .315? Musial

led the National League in hitting

six times. He's only having a fair

year, this year -- and he's still

hitting .320. Musial is an all-time

great!

CHARLIE

Yeah. I guess so.

ARNOLD

(stiff with liquor)

Eddie -- Eddie. So what do you think,

Eddie? You think I ought to go

through with this marriage?

EDDIE

I don't know about you, Arnold, but

if it was me, boy, I'd be in China

by now.

(back to Charlie)

Who have the Yankees got on first?

Skowron. Boy, how they touted

Skowron. All right, he's having a

lucky year.

CHARLIE

Yeah....

EDDIE

(continuing)

... Well, I mean, is there any

argument? Hodges is the best first

baseman in both leagues....

ARNOLD

So, Eddie, what do you think? You

think I ought to marry her, go to

China, or what?

EDDIE

Arnold, if it bothers you so much,

call her up and tell her to forget

the whole deal.

(back to Charlie)

All right Hodges is having a bad

year -- but how about last year? He

hit over .300. He only hit thirty-

five homers and he drove in over a

hundred runs----

ARNOLD

So, Eddie...

EDDIE

Arnold! Get rid of her! You're

driving me crazy!

EDDIE

(continuing)

All right, who's on second? We got

Charlie Neal or Gilliam, for that

matter, and this isn't even counting

Jackie Robinson, head and shoulders,

even with a trick knee, the best

second baseman in both leagues if

they'd let him play there. We got

three guys, for Pete's sake, who can

outplay anybody the Yankees put on

second.

EDDIE

(continuing)

Ever see Charlie Neal go to his

right? That Yankee guy, what's his

name -- he can't go to his right.

And don't forget Neal gets a lot of

bases on balls, and once he's on the

bases, man, it unnerves the pitcher ...

BARTENDER

What's Brooklyn going to do for

pitching?

EDDIE

Never heard of Newcombe? Never heard

of Erskine?

BARTENDER

What have you got to compare with

Ford, Kucks, McDermott, Turley---

EDDIE

McDermott -- McDermott hasn't

pitched a full game since last year.

BARTENDER

The best relief pitcher in both

leagues.

EDDIE

What's the matter with Eddie Roebuck?

BARTENDER

How do you compare Eddie Roebuck

with McDermott?

EDDIE

What are you, a Yankee fan?

BARTENDER

Yeah.

EDDIE

Well, drop dead.

(turns angrily

back to Charlie)

A Yankee fan.

ARNOLD'S VOICE

Hey!

ARNOLD

I did it.

EDDIE

You did what?

ARNOLD

I just woke her up! I called her! I

said: "I'm not going to marry you.

What do I want to marry you for? I'm

having a ball. What am I going to

marry you for?"

EDDIE

What is he talking about?

BARTENDER

Boy, he's gone.

CHARLIE

I think he's just called his girl,

broke his engagement.

EDDIE

Is that what he was yelling about?

CHARLIE

(trying to raise

Arnold's head)

Wake up, kid. Help me get him up,

Eddie.

EDDIE

You think he did it because I was

needling him there before? I was

just needling him.

BARTENDER

You better get him out of here

because I'm closing up now.

CHARLIE

We better get him home.

EDDIE

Ah, let's not break it up yet. I

thought you were waiting for this

girl.

CHARLIE

It's three o'clock in the morning,

for Pete's sake.

BARTENDER

Take him out in the air. He'll be

all right.

CHARLIE

What a bachelor party. We start out

celebrating the guy's wedding; we

wind up breaking his engagement.

(moves to bar)

What do we owe you here?

(he puts some change

on the counter)

Eddie, pay it, will you? I gave you

the ten bucks.

EDDIE

(following him

to the bar)

What do you want to go home for?

CHARLIE

It's going to take us an hour to get

him home. He lives in Queens

somewheres. By the time I get back

to Fourteenth Street, it'll be

daybreak. What are you going to do,

stay up all night? Don't you want to

go home sometimes?

EDDIE

What am I going to do home? I read

all the papers.

CHARLIE

(crosses to Arnold)

Well, go to sleep then.

EDDIE

Ah, don't go home, Charlie. I feel

like doing something.

CHARLIE

What? Stand around this bar and

argue about the Yankees and the

Dodgers? Wind up with some miserable,

lonely girl who begs you to say, "I

love you"? Go home, Eddie. Go to bed.

You got to go home sometimes. I'll

take Arnold home. Come on, Arnold,

kid. I'm going to take you home.

EDDIE

(spiritlessly)

Hey, honey, what are you, a Yankee

fan or a Dodger fan?

BAR HAG

Hiya.

DISSOLVE TO:

CHARLIE

(gently)

Are you all right, Arnold?

CHARLIE

Would you like to go back in and

sit down?

CHARLIE

What subway do you take, Arnold,

the BMT? Can you make it?

CHARLIE

Come on, Arnold, I'll take you home.

THE EXISTENTIALIST

Is he all right?

CHARLIE

(nods)

Yeah, he's all right. Look, I've got

to take my friend home...

THE EXISTENTIALIST

(calling lightly)

Are you coming back? Where does he

live? How long will you be?

DISSOLVE TO:

ARNOLD

Well, thanks a lot, Charlie.

CHARLIE

You all right?

ARNOLD

Yeah, I'm all right. I'm a little

groggy, but I'm awake anyway. You

don't want to come in, do you?

CHARLIE

No, I don't think so.

ARNOLD

I think my father and mother are up.

I hear voices. My girl must have

called them because they wouldn't

be up at this hour.

CHARLIE

Well, you just go in and explain to

them that you were drunk, and you're

sorry, and you'll call your girl the

first thing in the morning because

she must really be upset about this.

ARNOLD

(who has been

listening at

his door)

I think she's here.

CHARLIE

Who?

ARNOLD

My girl. I think I hear her voice in

there.

CHARLIE

Well, be nice to her, Arnold.

Remember, you woke her up in the

middle of the night and probably

scared her to death.

ARNOLD

What'll I say to her, Charlie?

CHARLIE

I don't know, Arnold. What do you

feel like saying to her? Do you

really love this girl? Do you want

to marry her? Are you marrying this

girl because your family wants you

to marry her, or why?

ARNOLD

I think I like her, Charlie. It's

just that I'm afraid I won't make a

good husband.

CHARLIE

Well, tell her what you told me,

Arnold. Tell her you're scared, and

that you don't think you'll make a

good husband. If she's a halfway

decent girl, she'll try to understand

how you feel, and, if she loves you,

she's going to make it her job to

make you happy. That's what love is,

Arnold, when you have somebody else

in the world you want to be happy.

My wife, Arnold, I don't know what

I'd do without her. Arnold, I've got

a tough grind ahead of me. Work all

day, I'll go to night school at night.

But my wife knows that I need this to

be happy, and she does everything she

knows to help me. And we've got a

baby coming. But if you love that

baby and you love your wife, then

it's easy. Everything seems so easy

to me now -- I don't know why I even

thought of quitting.

(tears have welled

in his eyes, and he

hurriedly puts his

hand to his face

shading his reddening

eyes)

Arnold, I want my wife so much right

now. I want her to be happy. I want

to just go home and hold her and tell

her how much she means to me. I mean,

even Walter, he's going to die, but

don't you think he'll be in tomorrow

morning, same old Walter, jokes and

laughs? He's got somebody to live

for. He's even got somebody to die

for. I mean, how rich can a man be?

And poor Eddie -- I used to be so

jealous of him. I used to think he

was so free. Free from what? From

loving a woman, from really wanting

a woman. Arnold, what I'm trying to

tell you is life is nothing if you

don't love somebody but life is

wonderful if you do love somebody.

Arnold, I want my wife so much right

now ...

ARNOLD

I'm going to tell her about that

woman tonight and everything. I'll

tell her about that woman.

CHARLIE

Arnold, I want to get home so much

to my wife right now I'm going to

bust.

ARNOLD

I'll see you, Charlie.

CHARLIE

Good-bye, Arnold, have a nice

honeymoon. I'll see you when you get

back.

ARNOLD

I'll see you, Charlie.

ARNOLD

Hello, Louise. I'm very sorry,

honest.

LOUISE

Sure, Arnold, I know.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CHARLIE

I love you, Helen.

HELEN

(crying softly)

I love you so much, Charlie. I love

you so much....

CHARLIE

I love you....

HELEN

I love you, Charlie, I love you,

Charlie. I love you, Charlie ...

FADE OUT
