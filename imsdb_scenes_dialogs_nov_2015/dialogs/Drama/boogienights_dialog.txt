for them, ask to see it?

DIRK

Yeah.

JACK

Have you done it tonight?

Couple times.

JACK

Eddie Adams from Torrance. I'm Jack

Horner, Filmmaker.

DIRK

JACK

I make adult films. Erotic pictures.

DIRK

in a magazine. "Inside Amber," "Amanda's

Ride." You made those --

JACK

So you know me, you know I'm not full

of doggy-doo-doo --

DIRK

Yeah . . . .

JACK

So why don't you come back

to my table, have a drink,

DIRK

I'd love to but . . . I'm working --

JACK

You need money, you have to pay the rent --

DIRK

But I don't pay rent. I live at home.

JACK

Tell me how old you are, Eddie.

DIRK

. . . I'm seventeen . . . .

JACK

You're a seventeen year old piece of gold.

DIRK

Yeah, right.

JACK

Why don't you come back to my table,

DIRK

I can't do that to Maurice.

JACK

You're a good worker, yeah?

DIRK

I'm sorry, I do know you, I know

who you are, I'd love to have a drink

with you and I know you're not full of --

JACK

-- doggy-doo-doo.

DIRK

Yeah, yeah. But I just can't

walk out on Maurice. I'm sorry.

JACK

It seems to me, beneath those jeans,

there's something wonderful just

waiting to get out --

JACK

You want somethin' to eat?

I'm onnamake some eggs.

AMBER

I'm goin' to sleep.

JACK

Goodnight, honey-tits. Sleep beautiful.

AMBER

Tom . . . hi . . . yeah. I know it's late, but . . .

(beat)

Yeah. Is Andy there? Is he . . . ?

I'd like to say hello, I'd like to say

hello to my son and that's all.

(beat)

Lemme tell you something, Tom.

Lemme tell you something you don't know;

I know a lawyer, you understand?

You might think I don't but I do

and I'll take you to court . . . .

(beat)

No . . . please don't, Tom, Tom, Tom --

LITTLE BILL

What the fuck are you doing?

LITTLE BILL'S WIFE

The fuck does it look like I'm doing?

I've got a cock in my pussy, you idiot.

BIG STUD

Will you close the door?

LITTLE BILL

Will I close the door? You're fucking

my wife, asshole.

BIG STUD

Relax, little man.

LITTLE BILL'S WIFE

Just get out, Bill. Fucking sleep on the couch.

(to Big Stud)

Keep going, Big Stud.

DIRK

That's right.

FATHER

Good morning.

MOTHER

. . . Jesus. Please, okay? Shave if you're

gonna do that, it scratches my face.

FATHER

How's that work, you get home late, huh?

DIRK

Yeah.

MOTHER

If you wanna work in a nightclub you

should . . . if it's so important . . . you

should find one closer.

DIRK

. . . yeah . . .

DIRK

I've gotta get to work.

MOTHER

. . . at a car wash . . .

DIRK

What?

MOTHER

You work at a car wash, school never

occurred to you?

BUCK

-- so basically you're gettin'

twice the base, cause of the TK421

modification we got in this system here.

CUSTOMER

I don't know - do I need that much bass?

BUCK

If you want a system to handle

what you want -- yes you do.

See this system here. This is Hi-Fi.

"High Fidelity." What that means is

that it's the highest quality fidelity.

CUSTOMER

It's the price --

BUCK

I have this unit at home.

CUSTOMER

. . . really . . . ?

BUCK

Yes. But -- I've got it modified

with the TK421, which is a bass unit

that basically kicks in another two,

maybe three quads when you really

crank -- lemme put another eight track

in so you can get a better idea what

I'm talkin about --

BUCK

Hear that bass? It kicks and turns

and curls up in your belly, makes you

wanna freaky-deaky, right? If you get

this unit as it is -- it won't sound

like this without the modification --

and we do that for a small price.

CUSTOMER

Thank you for your time.

BUCK

No problem.

JERRY

. . . the fuck was that?

BUCK

Wha?

JERRY

Have I told you? Huh? Have I?

BUCK

What? I don't --

JERRY

Alright: A.) You play that country

western-crap and no one's gonna buy

a stereo. You throw on some KC and

the Sunshine Band, a guy looks a particular

way -- and you've seen the profile sheet --

you throw on some Led Zeppelin. No.

Instead, you play this twingy-twangy,

yappy-dappy music. What kinda brother

are you anyway, listening to that shit?

BUCK

Hey, Jerry, look --

JERRY

No, you look. I gave you a job here

because I thought your film work

might bring some nice pussy in the

place -- and it has -- but I can't

have anymore fuck ups -- you dig?

BUCK

Yeah.

JERRY

Alright. Go unload the new 484's

from the back room.

DIRK

I have to get back.

SHERYL LYNN

Once more.

DIRK

I have to get back to work.

SHERYL LYNN

Give it to me, Eddie.

DIRK

Don't make me pounce you, Sheryl Lynn.

SHERYL LYNN

Ohhhh-baby, baby, baby.

DIRK

I'll do it --

SHERYL LYNN

Promise?

DIRK

That's it.

DICK (OC)

What?

SHERYL LYNN

You're so beautiful.

DICK (OC)

Yeah . . .

SHERYL LYNN

Do you know how good you are at

doing this, Eddie? Having sex . . . fucking me . . .

making love to me?

DIRK

Everyone has one thing, y'think? I mean:

Everyone is given one special thing . . . . right?

SHERYL LYNN

That's right.

DIRK

Everyone is blessed with One Special Thing.

DIRK

I want you to know: I plan on being a star.

A big, bright shining star. That's what

I want and it's what I'm gonna get.

SHERYL LYNN

I know.

DIRK

And once I get it: I'm never gonna stop

and I'll never, ever make a mistake.

JACK

Hey. Eddie.

DIRK

Hello. Jack?

JACK

Yeah. You wanna ride?

DIRK

I'm goin' pretty far.

ROLLERGIRL

You remember me? Couple hours ago?

DIRK

Yeah . . . I remember you.

AMBER

Come with us, sweetie.

DIRK

Okay.

JACK

This thing here, I mean, you understand

one thing and that's this: It costs.

I mean, this stuff costs good ol' American

Green. You got film, you got lights,

you got sound, lab fees, developing, synching,

editing -- next thing you know you're

spending thirty/forty thousand a picture.

DIRK

That's a lot of money.

JACK

Hell yes it's a lot of money, but lemme

tell you something else: You make a good

film and there's practically no end to the

amount of money you can make, Eddie.

AMBER

Have you seen Jack's house?

DIRK (OC)

No.

JACK (OC)

He'll see it.

ROLLERGIRL (OC)

He'll see it.

JACK (OC)

Eddie: You got ten, fifteen people around

and that's just to make sure the lighting is

right . . . shit, this is not an operation for

the weak, and lemme tell you something else:

When all is said and done, you gotta have the

juice, you understand? I mean . . . you can work

on your arms, your legs, workout morning, day,

noon, night, the whole deal, but when it comes

right down to it . . . what we need is Mr. Torpedo

Area, y'understand? Mr. Fun Zone? Okay, let's

say you got that: right? And You Do Got, Yeah?

JACK

I can go out -- tonight -- the reputation

I got: I can find myself 15/20 guys,

cocks the size of Willie Mays Baseball Bat:

Do I want that? No. Do I need that? No.

I need actors.

AMBER

Uhhh-ohhh . . . here we go --

JACK

-- Alright, yeah, I need the big dick,

and the big tits -- that GETS them in

the theater. What keeps them in their

seats even after they've come? Huh?

The beauty and the acting.

If you're able to give it up and show the world:

No, not just your cock. Fuck that.

What I'm talking about is showing your

insides, from your heart . . . you understand?

Hey, Sure: GET THEM IN THE THEATER.

That's one thing. I don't want 'em showing up,

sitting down, jacking off and splitting on

the story. I don't want to make that film.

I wanna make the thing that keeps 'em around

even after they've come . . . what happens when you

come? You're done, you wanna split.

My idea, my goal: Suck 'em in with the

story . . . they'll squirt their load and sit in it . . .

Just To See How The Story Ends.

Sometimes we make these films, we wanna

make people laugh a little, then get into

it and fuck heavy: That's good and that's fine.

But I got a dream of making a film that's

true . . . true and right and dramatic.

DIRK

. . . Right . . . right . . . I understand.

AMBER

Don't listen too hard to all this,

honey . . . it's just nice in theory.

JACK

It's a dream to be able to find

a cock and an actor.

ROLLERGIRL

Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream.

DIRK

If you don't have dreams you have nightmares.

JACK (OC)

Did you want a Fresca, Eddie?

DIRK

No thanks.

JACK

You're sure . . . ?

ROLLERGIRL (OC)

. . . you're out of limes, Jack.

JACK (OC)

Check in the studio fridge . . .

AMBER (OC)

I'm going to bed.

JACK (OC)

Good night, honey.

AMBER (OC)

Good night, Jackie. Don't stay up too late.

Good night, Eddie. I'm glad you came by.

AMBER

You're great.

DIRK

Thank you.

JACK

She's the best, Eddie. A mother.

A real and wonderful mother to all

those who need love.

DIRK (OC)

She's really nice.

JACK

So what do you think . . . I think

we ought to be in business together.

DIRK (OC)

. . . yeah . . . ?

JACK

What do you think of Rollergirl?

DIRK (OC)

She's . . . she's really great . . .

JACK

Would you like to get it on with her?

DIRK (OC)

Have sex?

JACK

Yeah.

DIRK (OC)

Yeah, I'd love to. I mean, yes.

She's . . . she's really foxy.

JACK

Bet your ass she is --

ROLLERGIRL

You're officially out of limes, Jack.

JACK

I'll get you some more tomorrow.

Come over here a minute. Sit next

to Eddie on the couch there.

ROLLERGIRL

Here We Go! Are We Gonna Fuck?

JACK

Yes you are.

ROLLERGIRL

Oh, wait, wait, wait, then.

ROLLERGIRL

You ready?

DIRK

Are you?

ROLLERGIRL

Ohhh-yeah.

DIRK

Are you gonna take your skates off?

ROLLERGIRL

I don't take my skates off.

DIRK

Okay.

ROLLERGIRL

Don't fucking come in me.

JACK

Don't come in her, Eddie. I want you

to pull it out and jack off, make sure

you aim it towards her face.

ROLLERGIRL

Fuck you, Jack.

JACK

Towards her tits, then.

DIRK

Hi.

MOTHER

Where were you?

DIRK

Nowhere.

MOTHER

Shut up. Shut up. Where were you?

MOTHER

You see that little slut girl you see?

Sheryl? Sheryl Lynn?

DIRK

Don't say that.

MOTHER

Does it make you feel like a stud to

see trash like that? Huh? What is she?

Your girl-friend?

DIRK

She's not my girlfriend.

MOTHER

She's a little whore and a little

piece of trash . . . I know you're not

the only one that she sees.

DIRK

What . . . what're you . . . you don't know.

MOTHER

I've heard things about her. That girl.

Don't think I don't know what goes on

when I'm not here . . . I wash your sheets, kid.

I know she's been here. Or are you doing

some other thing in there? With your

music and your posters on the wall?

MOTHER (OC)

Why don't you go to your little whore,

Sheryl Lynn. Your little GIRLFRIEND.

DIRK (OC)

Maybe I will.

MOTHER (OC)

Oh yeah? Yeah, what are you gonna do?

DIRK (OC)

I dunno, I'll do something.

MOTHER

You can't do anything. You're a loser.

You'll always be a loser -- you couldn't

even finish high school because you were

too stupid -- so what are you gonna do?

DIRK

I'll do something . . . I'll do it.

I'll go somewhere and do something,

maybe I'll run away where you can never

find me.

MOTHER

Go ahead. Go ahead and fuck

that little GIRL.

MOTHER

What do you think you're doing?

DIRK

I'm getting my stuff --

MOTHER

-- you think that's your stuff?

That's not your stuff . . . you didn't pay

for that -- it's not yours because

you didn't pay for it, stupid.

MOTHER

None of this stuff is yours. This:

MOTHER (OC)

If you're gonna leave, you leave with what

you've got: Nothing. Y'see . . . you treat me

like this and this is what you get.

That's fair. Huh? You wanna live that way?

Fuck that little whore. I've taken care of

you all your miserable fucking life . . . .

MOTHER (OC)

. . . you pay for it . . . you owe me for all the

shit I've done for you in your life . . . . you

little fucker . . . you understand? Think you're

gonna be this? Huh? These god damn posters --

you're not gonna be this -- you're gonna

be shit . . . because you're stupid.

DIRK

I'm not stupid.

MOTHER

Yes you are.

DIRK

Why are you so mean to me? You're my mother . . .

MOTHER

Not by choice.

DIRK

Don't. Don't be mean to me.

MOTHER

You little fucker, I'm not being mean

to you, you're just too stupid to see.

DIRK

You don't know what I can do. You don't

know what I can do or what I'm gonna do

or what I'm gonna be. You don't know.

I'm good. I have good things that you

don't know and I'm gonna be something --

you -- You Don't Know And You'll See.

MOTHER

You can't do anything.

You'll never do anything --

DIRK

Don't be mean to me.

MOTHER

YOU LITTLE FUCKER, I'M NOT BEING MEAN TO YOU!

DIRK

AND YOU DON'T BE MEAN, AND YOU DON'T

TALK TO ME . . . . NO.

JACK

Eddie Adams from Torrance! You made it,

you made it, my darling, come on in here.

I want you to meet someone --

JACK

COLONEL

JACK

Colonel, hello and welcome!

COLONEL

Hello, Jack. This is my Lady Friend.

Hello, darling.

LADY FRIEND

Do you have coke at this party?

JACK

Well I'm sure we can find you some.

COLONEL

Find her some coke, Jack.

JACK

We will, we will. Thanks for coming by.

MAURICE

. . . y'see, Miss Amber, I'm just a poor fellow

from Puerto Rico. I have the club, yes,

that's one thing . . . but soon . . . the club goes . . .

I die . . . and what do I have? I've got nothing.

AMBER

Uh-huh.

MAURICE

I want something to send back home.

Something to send back to my brothers and say:

Look At Me. Look At The Women I've Been With.

AMBER

So what . . . do you want me to talk to him?

MAURICE

Yes . . . I mean . . . y'know . . . what do you

think I'm askin' here?

AMBER

. . . you wanna be in a movie?

MAURICE

Please. Tell him I won't be bad. Please.

AMBER

I'll see what I can do.

BECKY

. . . because it's old . . . it's old deal.

BUCK

Lemme tell you something:

BECKY

He was obviously pissed about the music.

BUCK

What's wrong with it, y'know?

BECKY

Look, Buck: The cowboy look ended

about six years ago --

BUCK

-- it's comin' back.

BECKY

No it's not. It's over, it's dead.

BUCK

You don't know what you're talkin' about.

BECKY

I'm just saying and it seems like your

boss at the stereo store is saying the

same thing --

BUCK

-- what, what?

BECKY

Get a new look.

BUCK

Yeah . . . yeah . . . yeah . . . you get a new look.

BECKY

The look I've got is just fine.

BUCK

What's your look?

BECKY

Chocolate Love, Baby.

BUCK

Yeah, right.

BECKY

OH SHIT! TURN IT UP! I LOVE THIS SONG!

LADY FRIEND

Excuse me . . . ?

YOUNG STUD

Yes?

LADY FRIEND

May I please join in?

YOUNG STUD

Most certainly.

LITTLE BILL

Just don't embarrass me, alright?

LITTLE BILL'S WIFE

Fuck you, Bill.

LITTLE BILL

I work with these people, alright?

These are my coworkers, so just --

LITTLE BILL'S WIFE

Bite it.

LITTLE BILL

Don't make me do something.

LITTLE BILL'S WIFE

Ohhh . . . I'm so scared.

ROLLERGIRL

What's wrong, Little Bill?

LITTLE BILL

Nothing. How are you, Rollergirl?

ROLLERGIRL

I'm fine.

LITTLE BILL

Is Jack around?

ROLLERGIRL

He's in the house.

JACK

The idea is this: Amber is a director

of porno films and she's down on her luck.

She hasn't had a hit in a year. She's

desperate. Her landlord is threatening to kick her

out, so she's desperate for a big dick hit, right?

COLONEL

Yes. Good dilemma.

JACK

Yes. So she calls up all the agencies

in town and says: "Send over your best

actors, I'm casting a porno picture."

Well, the story goes and develops with

Amber auditioning various men and

women . . . the whole thing wraps up with

the Landlord, I'd like to get Jeremy if

he's still in town to play the part --

he comes in -- the landlord says:

You better pay rent or you're through.

Well, Amber does one helluva suck job,

ass fuck, come in the face, sort of thing

and fade out - the end.

COLONEL

That's great.

JACK

There's a kid, a young man, I met him

last night: His name is Eddie Adams.

He's here, he's at the party. He's something

special and I want to cast him.

COLONEL

What films has he done?

JACK

This would be his first.

COLONEL

Casting is up to you, Jack. You wanna do it?

Then do it. If it has big tits, tight pussy

and focus: I'm happy. You tell the stories

you wanna tell, make yourself happy.

REED

Do a cannonball.

DIRK

No, no. Watch this Jacknife.

DIRK

JACKNIFE.

DIRK

How did it look?

REED

Great. Check this out.

(gets on the board)

This is gonna be a full-flip.

REED

Ouch.

DIRK

You gotta try and bring your legs

all the way around . . . .

REED

Yeah.

LITTLE BILL

How you doin', Rocky?

ROCKY

Good, good, what's wrong?

LITTLE BILL

Nothin'. Nothin' at all.

ROCKY

Do you have the schedule for the shoot, or . . . ?

LITTLE BILL

Yeah. You're on.

ROCKY

Is it here?

LITTLE BILL

Yeah, it's gonna be here, but it's a simple one . . .

MAURICE

Hey, hey, hey, my point is this:

BUCK

What?

MAURICE

You know what I say?

BUCK

What-What?

MAURICE

Wear What You Dig.

MAURICE

Hello?

(beat)

I'm sorry . . . I can't hear you

that well . . . say again . . . ? Maggie?

(to Buck)

Is there a Maggie here?

BUCK

I don't know a Maggie.

MAURICE

(into phone)

I think you might have the wrong number . . . .

Your mother? I'm sorry . . . wait . . . just . . . wait . . .

MAURICE

Watch that a minute . . . .

MAURICE

(calls out)

Is there a Maggie here?

MAURICE

(into phone)

I'm sorry . . . there's no Maggie here.

Okay . . . okay . . . no problem . . . Bye.

BUCK

What was it?

MAURICE

Some kid lookin' for his mother.

LITTLE BILL

. . . the fuck are you doing?

WATCHER #1

What does it look like they're doing?

LITTLE BILL

That's my wife.

LITTLE BILL'S WIFE

Shut up, Bill.

WATCHER #2

Yeah, shut up, Bill.

KURT LONGJOHN

Little Bill.

LITTLE BILL

Hey. Kurt. What's up?

KURT LONGJOHN

What's wrong with you?

LITTLE BILL

Ah . . . my fuckin' wife, man, she's

over there . . . she's got some idiot's

dick in her, people standing around

watching -- it's a fuckin' embarrassment.

KURT LONGJOHN

Yeah. Yeah. I know. Anyway, listen:

LITTLE BILL

-- yeah.

KURT LONGJOHN

For the shoot -- I wanna talk about the look.

I wanted to see about getting this new zoom lens . . .

LITTLE BILL

Right.

KURT LONGJOHN

I wondered if we'd be able to look into

getting some more lights, too, y'know --

LITTLE BILL

Jack wants a minimal-thing --

KURT LONGJOHN

Right, well, very often, minimal means

a lot more photographically than I think,

well . . . then I think most people understand . . .

LITTLE BILL

I understand.

KURT LONGJOHN

No, no. Hey. I know you understand,

I was talking about some other people.

LITTLE BILL

Well, I think what Jack is talking

about is minimal, not really "natural,"

but minimal . . .

KURT LONGJOHN

OK . . . fine . . . I was just saying . . .

LITTLE BILL

I understand --

KURT LONGJOHN

-- 'cause I'm just trying to give each

picture it's own look --

LITTLE BILL

Can we talk about this later?

KURT LONGJOHN

Oh, yeah . . . you have to go somewhere . . . or . . . ?

LITTLE BILL

Well, no, yeah . . . I mean . . .

KURT LONGJOHN

'Cause I was hoping to, y'know, for the

shoot tomorrow, we could send Rocky down

and he could pick it up --

LITTLE BILL

Kurt.

KURT LONGJOHN

No. Hey. Gotcha. You've gotta go somewhere

so -- hey -- what the fuck? It's only the

photography of the movie we're talkin' about --

LITTLE BILL

Are you givin' me shit, Kurt?

KURT LONGJOHN

NO, NO, HEY. No way, Little Bill.

LITTLE BILL

My fucking wife has a cock in her ass over

in the driveway, alright? I'm sorry if my

thoughts aren't with the photography of the

film we're shooting tomorrow, Kurt, OK?

KURT LONGJOHN

OK. No big deal. Sorry.

LITTLE BILL

Alright?

KURT LONGJOHN

Gotcha.

YOUNG STUD

I think she's sick.

COLONEL

What the fuck is this?

YOUNG STUD

I didn't do anything.

JACK

Is she breathing?

YOUNG STUD

I don't know. I think she did too much coke?

COLONEL

Duh. Do you think so, smarty?

LIMO DRIVER

She's definitely overdosing.

COLONEL

Oh . . . what the fuck . . . .

COLONEL

Alright: Johnny. You're gonna take care

of this for me. You listening here?

LIMO DRIVER

Yeah.

COLONEL

I want you to pick her up, get her in

the car, take her down to St. Joe's.

LIMO DRIVER

Okay.

COLONEL

Listen, though: You drop her off in

the front, I don't want this . . . y'understand?

I don't need this, here.

LIMO DRIVER

Gotcha.

COLONEL

Make sure no one sees the limo.

LIMO DRIVER

Got it.

COLONEL

Young Stud, I want you to help my driver

Johnny here get her in the car.

COLONEL

(to Jack)

What the fuck is this?

(to Young Stud)

Hey . . . hey . . . pal . . . get a grip, man.

YOUNG STUD

I'm sorry . . . it's just . . . it's just . . . .

COLONEL

What?

YOUNG STUD

I . . . I . . . I . . . .

COLONEL

Spit it out.

YOUNG STUD

This is twice in two days a chick

has O.D.'d on me.

COLONEL

Well maybe that means you oughta think about

getting some new shit, what do you think?

YOUNG STUD

Yes, sir.

COLONEL

Jesus Christ. Now be a man, deal with the

situation and get her in the car.

COLONEL

Y'see that, all this fuckin' conversation --

YOUNG STUD

Please don't die!

LIMO DRIVER

C'mon, pal.

JACK

Close call.

COLONEL

Yes.

SCOTTY J.

Hey Reed.

REED

Hey -- Scotty, how are you?

SCOTTY J.

Y'know, y'know.

(re: Dirk)

Who's this?

REED

Eddie -- meet Scotty J. He's a friend,

he works on some of the films.

DIRK

Nice to meet you.

SCOTTY J.

You too. Are you gonna be working?

DIRK

Maybe.

REED

Probably.

SCOTTY J.

That's great. That's great. Where did

you meet Jack? 'Cause I work on the films,

y'know, sometimes, that's why I'm wondering

if you, you know --

JACK (OC)

EDDIE! EDDIE! Come over here a minute.

DIRK

Excuse me.

SCOTTY J.

Yeah, okay.

DIRK

Nice to meet you.

REED (OC)

You wanna take a seat, Scotty?

SCOTTY J.

Uh . . . I dunno . . . is it alright?

REED (OC)

Yeah.

SCOTTY J.

Thank you. It gets a little hard

mingling around . . . y'know . . . talking to

people and stuff . . . it's sort of --

That kid Eddie is really good looking, huh?

JACK

This young man is interested

in the business.

COLONEL

Well, you're in good hands if you

get involved with Jack, here.

DIRK

Oh yeah?

COLONEL

I can't give you much advice that Jack

probably doesn't know, but I can advise,

maybe you think about your name . . . ?

DIRK

My name . . . yeah . . . ?

COLONEL

Think about something that makes you happy,

something that also gives some pizzaz . . . y'know?

DIRK

Right.

JACK

The Colonel pays for all our films, Eddie.

He's an important parts of the process.

DIRK

Well, great. Great.

COLONEL

I look forward to seeing you in action.

Jack says you've got a great big cock.

DIRK

. . . um . . . yeah, I dunno, I guess?

COLONEL

Can I see it?

DIRK

Really?

COLONEL

Please.

COLONEL

Thank you, Eddie.

DIRK

No problem.

COLONEL

Jesus Christ. Jesus Lord in Heaven.

LITTLE BILL

Thanks for fucking up this party for me.

I appreciate it.

LITTLE BILL'S WIFE

Oh Fuck Off. Will You?

LITTLE BILL

You Fuck Off.

LITTLE BILL'S WIFE

Yeah, right.

LIMO DRIVER

Hey, hey, hey. I mean: How were

you supposed to know?

YOUNG STUD

I wasn't.

LIMO DRIVER

That's right. So what did you do wrong?

YOUNG STUD

Nothing?

LIMO DRIVER

Nothing is absolutely right, Young Stud.

YOUNG STUD

Thank you for your help.

LIMO DRIVER

No problem.

COLONEL

You ready, Johnny?

LIMO DRIVER

Yes, sir.

COLONEL

How you doin', pal?

YOUNG STUD

I'm okay, sir.

COLONEL

Don't worry about it. She'll be fine.

YOUNG STUD

She died in the limo on the way to the hospital.

COLONEL

I didn't hear that.

YOUNG STUD

What?

COLONEL

You never told me that and what happened,

never happened. You got me?

YOUNG STUD

I get you.

COLONEL

Now go home. Sleep it off.

JACK

Thanks for coming, Colonel.

COLONEL

Great party, Jack.

REED

. . . you wanna hear a poem I wrote?

DIRK

Yeah.

REED

Okay. Um . . .

"I love you. You love me.

Going down the Sugar Tree.

We'll go down the Sugar Tree.

And See Lots of Bees. Playing.

Playing. The bees won't sting.

'Cause you love me."

DIRK

That's fucking great, man.

JACK

Howdy-boys.

DIRK/REED

Hey, Jack.

JACK

Good party?

DIRK

It was great.

JACK

Good. You had a good time then?

DIRK

Excellent time. Thank you.

JACK

What this place is for, right?

REED

Right.

JACK

Ahhhh . . . this feels good. Bubbles.

Turn those bubbles higher, Reed.

DIRK

Jack . . . I was thinking about my name . . . y'know . . . ?

JACK

Yeah?

DIRK

I was wondering if you had any ideas.

JACK

I've got a few . . . but you tell me . . .

DIRK

Well . . . my idea was . . . y'know . . .

I want a name . . . I want it so it

can cut glass . . . y'know . . . razor sharp.

JACK

Tell me.

DIRK

When I close my eyes . . . I see this thing,

a sign . . . I see this name in bright blue neon

lights with a purple outline. And this name

is so bright and so sharp that the sign --

it just blows up because the name is so powerful . . . .

DIRK DIGGLER

DIRK (OC)

It says, "Dirk Diggler."

JACK

Heaven sent you here to this place,

Dirk Diggler. You've been blessed.

JACK

How close?

KURT LONGJOHN

Give me twenty to thirty. I've got a

couple tough shadows to deal with --

JACK

Okay, but not too long, Kurt, right?

Remember, there are shadows in real life.

LITTLE BILL

You wanna go over this?

JACK

Yeah. Let's . . . .

LITTLE BILL

(reading from script)

Okay. Set up is . . . here we go:

1.) Amber talking to Becky about auditions.

They make the phone call to the agency to

send over some actors.

2.) Enter Reed to audition for Amber.

They go at it. Becky just watches.

C.) Becky goes to the bathroom to jack-off

and is interrupted by Amber. They get into it.

E.) Enter Dirk --

(looks up)

Who's Dirk Diggler?

JACK

The kid, Eddie, from the club.

LITTLE BILL

Good name. Anyway: 4.) Dirk enters.

Meets with Becky. They go at it --

JACK

I wanna change that -- that should be Amber.

Dirk should be auditioning with Amber.

JACK

Becky, honey --

BECKY

What?

JACK

What're you doing? We're shooting

in twenty minutes.

BECKY

I'm shaving my bush --

JACK

Now?

BECKY

It only takes two seconds, Jack.

JACK

Fine, fine.

JACK

Alright everyone, let's go, let's go,

we need to shoot this first scene --

we need to get one off --

SCOTTY J.

Hey. Hi. Dirk. Dirk Diggler.

DIRK

Hi.

SCOTTY J.

I'm supposed to come get you.

Tell you they're ready, now.

DIRK

Okay.

SCOTTY J.

You look really good.

DIRK

Thank you.

SCOTTY J.

You look really sexy.

DIRK

Thanks.

SCOTTY J.

I like your name.

DIRK

You do.

SCOTTY J.

It's really cool.

DIRK

Thanks.

SCOTTY J.

OK . . . well . . . whenever you're ready . . .

I'll see you out there.

JACK

Ready, champ?

DIRK

Let's do this.

JACK

So we know the scene, we know the thing.

You're gonna start outside the set,

through that door, I'll call your name

and action, that'll be your cue . . . come through

the door, straight to the desk, right here,

boom, you and Amber do the scene --

DIRK

Do we go straight into having sex?

JACK

Is that alright?

DIRK

It would be better I think, y'know,

so we don't break up the momentum

or something --

JACK

Amber?

AMBER

Good.

JACK

So we'll just go straight through.

DIRK

Okay.

KURT LONGJOHN

Are we doing a rehearsal?

JACK

Eddie, you want a rehearsal?

DIRK

It's okay . . . I can do it . . .

JACK

Great.

DIRK

Jack?

JACK

Yeah?

DIRK

. . . can you . . . um . . . will you call me

Dirk Diggler from now on?

JACK

Yes. I'm sorry, yeah, yes.

AMBER

Do you want to practice your lines with me?

DIRK

I know it.

AMBER

You look great, honey.

DIRK

Does he want me to keep going until I come?

AMBER

Yeah. You just come when you're ready . . .

DIRK

Where should I come?

AMBER

Where do you want?

DIRK

Wherever you tell me.

AMBER

Come on my tits if you can, okay?

Just pull it out and do it on

my stomach and tits if you can.

DIRK

Yeah.

AMBER

Are you alright, honey?

DIRK

This is great. I'm ready. I wanna do good.

I wanna do this good . . . let's try and do it

really sexy . . . you want to?

AMBER

Okay.

JACK (OC)

and . . . action, Dirk.

AMBER

Hello. Are you John?

DIRK

Yes, ma'am.

AMBER

Your agency recommends you very highly.

DIRK

I'm a really hard worker. You give

me a job and I won't disappoint you.

AMBER

What special skills do you have?

DIRK

Well, I spent three years in the Marines.

I just got back from a tour of duty.

AMBER

You're kidding?

DIRK

No I'm not. It got really hard being

surrounded by guys all day.

AMBER

When was the last time you had a woman?

DIRK

A long time.

AMBER

That's terrible.

DIRK

But I'm back now and I'm ready to pursue

my acting career.

AMBER

Well as you may or may not know, this is an

important film for me. If it's not a hit,

I'm gonna get kicked out of my apartment.

My landlord is a real jerk.

DIRK

Really?

AMBER

Why don't you take your pants off?

It's important that I get an idea of your size.

DIRK

No problem.

AMBER

I think that you have the part,

but why don't I make sure of something . . .

AMBER

This is a giant cock.

JACK

Guys . . .

DIRK

Is everything cool?

JACK

Hang in there, everything's cool,

I just wanna change the angle --

You're doin' great.

AMBER

You're doin' so good, Dirk.

DIRK

Does it feel good?

JACK

Okay -- we're back, we're ready -- action --

AMBER

You're amazing.

DIRK

You feel good, Amber.

AMBER

Are you ready to come?

DIRK

Yes.

AMBER

Come in me.

DIRK

What?

AMBER

Don't worry, I'm fixed.

I want to come in me --

JACK

CUT! FUCK! YES! YES! YES!

JACK

That was great.

LITTLE BILL

Yes it was. What do you want to

do about the come shot? We could

go to the stock footage -- get a close up --

JACK

It's not gonna match, we don't

have a cock that big on film --

DIRK

Jack?

JACK

Yes, Dirk?

DIRK

I can do it again if you need a close-up.

JACK

What we can do is make it all one thing, right?

You can go from being on top -- below and then

move and shift to the side -- pump away

there for a while, then --

DIRK

If she . . . Rollergirl . . . if you wrap your leg

around . . . other one . . . your left leg . . . right . . .

up around my neck. And over. Good.

We can go right into Doggy Style.

KURT LONGJOHN

Is the movement of the waterbed a problem?

DIRK

Not at all, Kurt. Matter of fact, I dig it.

JACK

Jack Horner has found something special

in newcomer Dirk Diggler. It's another

stellar, sexual standout from Horner and Company.

Diggler delivers a performance worth a thousand

hard-ons. His presence when dressed is powerful

and demanding . . .

JACK (VO)

. . . when stripped to the bone, Diggler's

more eruptive than a volcano on a bad day.

Amber Waves ripe-cherry lips do a wonderful

job of handling Diggler's wide load and

Reed Rothchild's stiff biceps do a slapping

good job with Becky Barnett's supple ass . . .

JACK (VO)

. . . but it's Diggler that remains the standout

in this film. It's easy to predict, after only

two films, that's Diggler's suck-cess can only grow

and grow and grow --

AMBER

Please let me talk to him, Tom.

Please. I just want to say hello

and that's all -- I'm not. I'm completely sober.

I'm not -- Tom -- Tom -- Tom --

AMBER

I don't know what to do now.

MAURICE (VO)

Dear brothers: I'm sending you a picture --

MAURICE (VO)

-- this is my girlfriend. I had sex

with her last night. Isn't she hot?

I get chicks like this every night.

BUCK

If you were to open a business

specializing in, like, Super-Super

Hi-Fi Stereo Equipment -- forget it,

you're in the money. I mean, there's

no limit to the technology that's

comin' out now --

AMBER

Really?

BUCK

That's a fact.

AMBER

So what's wrong with this radio?

BUCK

I think it's . . . uh . . . it's a wattage

problem . . . yeah . . . we've got too many

watts per channel going into the front two

speaker . . . yeah . . .

JACK

-- what else?

DIRK

That's it for now. I mean: I look

at this character Holmes has come

up with -- and -- look -- I just --

JACK

Tell me.

DIRK

I don't like to see women treated that way.

This guy he plays, "Johnny Wad," it's always

about slapping some girl around or whatever.

It's not right, it's not cool and it just . . .

isn't sexy. It isn't sexy like it should be.

REED

We could make it more of a James Bond

character. This guy that's world traveled.

JACK

I like that.

DIRK

Reed could play my partner.

JACK

I like this a lot.

DIRK

We could make it really good, Jack.

Honestly. If you direct it . . . we could

make a whole series, with a whole story.

This is exactly what we've always talked about.

JACK

I know it. I know it.

REED

We should do this.

JACK

Alright. When we get back. We'll set up

the typewriter and we'll see what we can

come up with. I'll talk to the Colonel when

we get to Vegas. But Dirk, you gotta work

on him too, okay?

DIRK

Right, right.

JACK

-- if we don't put every element into this,

it's just not gonna work --

DIRK

Exactly.

JACK

Now: What's this guy's name?

This character? Do you know?

DIRK

His name is Brock Landers.

REED

His partner's name is Chest Rockwell.

JACK

. . . those are great names.

AMBER

And the award for "Best Newcomer"

goes to . . . Yes! My baby-boy . . . DIRK DIGGLER!

COLONEL JAMES

. . . the award for "Best Cock"

goes to . . . Here We Go Again . . . DIRK DIGGLER.

JESSIE

And The Award . . . for Best Actor Goes To . . .

I've seen his movies and I can't wait to

work with him, I can't wait to get that big

cock in my mouth, my ass, my pussy or any

which way he'll give it to me . . . Mr. Dirk Diggler!

DIRK

Wow. I dunno what to say . . . I guess. Wow.

I guess the only thing I can say, is that

I promise to keep rocking and rolling and

to keep making better films. It seems we make

these movies . . . and sometimes . . . they're considered

filthy or something by some people . . . but I don't

think that's true. These films we make can be

better . . . they can help . . . they really can, I mean it.

We can always do better -- and I'll keep trying

if you keep trying so let's keep ROCKING AND ROLLING.

JESSIE

You're hot.

JESSIE

Shot of Tequila, straight up.

MAURICE

Yes, ma'am.

JESSIE

(to Dirk)

I've been in this place twenty minutes,

just to get a seat.

DIRK

You alone?

JESSIE

Yeah. Just visiting L.A. Some people

told me the food in here was really good.

DIRK

Good. No, it's not good. It's probably

the BEST place to eat in Los Angeles.

It's excellent.

JESSIE

I certainly hope so. I could die of

starvation before I get something in my mouth --

DIRK

You said you were hungry --

JESSIE

Starving.

DIRK

Well, go ahead and feast.

JESSIE

Ohhh. It's true --

DIRK

What?

JESSIE

You're Brock Landers --

"BROCK LANDERS: ANGELS LIVE IN MY TOWN"

JACK

Good, good, it's close. Let's head trim

Dirk's spin, lose Reed with the revolver

and switch the main title card -- it should

really fly towards camera --

ROLLERGIRL

Fuck it, fine, let's go.

DIRK

And around this corner is the big surprise.

The main thing I wanna show you --

DIRK

Isn't it beautiful?

AMBER

You deserve this, baby.

DIRK

This is it -- this is the thing.

This is the most beautiful thing

I've ever seen in my life --

DIRK

So we solved the case and the women are safe --

REED

Just another day.

DIRK

That's right.

REED

C'mon, Brock. Let's go out and get

some of that Saturday Night Beaver --

JACK

This is the best work I've ever done.

KURT LONGJOHN

It's a real film, Jack.

JACK

It feels good.

KURT LONGJOHN

You made it fly.

JACK

This is the one they'll remember me by, baby.

DIRK

Thank you.

"Goodbye 70's -- Hello 80's"

BECKY

. . . right, right . . .

JEROME

Yeah . . . y'know . . . as far as I'm concerned,

it's about love. Y'know? You love someone

and how hard can the world be? I mean,

people will come and go and so will problems,

and ultimately, if you have love on your side

and in your soul, whatsa problem gonna be

that takes your attention away? Y'understand?

BECKY

I do . . . I do. That's really sweet.

JEROME

My name's Jerome.

BECKY

I'm Becky.

JEROME

Nice to meet 'ya, Becky.

BECKY

What do you do?

JEROME

I'm in the auto industry.

BECKY

Really?

JEROME

Yeah. I'm regional manager

for "Pep Boys."

BECKY

That's great.

JEROME

You've got a nice smile, Becky.

BECKY

Thank you.

JESSIE

Because sometimes I feel like an outsider

to the whole thing. Y'know . . . I see you and

Amber and your relationship and I dunno --

DIRK

No, no, Jessie. You shouldn't feel

like an outsider.

JESSIE

I know my tits aren't as big and I know

my pussy isn't as tight as all the other

girls in this industry but I still feel

like I've got something that works --

I can paint, too.

DIRK

Yes. Yes. Yes.

JESSIE

I dunno. I was just never really secure.

When I was a kid, I was never really secure

with myself that much -- I guess that's why

I try and act like I'm all care-free and everything.

DIRK

I know what you mean, sometimes I'm like,

"What am I doing?" "What the hell is wrong

with me?" Y'know?

JESSIE

I know, I know.

DIRK

But then . . . I think . . .

JESSIE

-- it's just fun. It's great.

DIRK

It is. It's the best. I mean, look:

I couldn't be happier than where

I am today, right now, at this moment.

JESSIE

You are so fucking awesome, Dirk.

DIRK

Who says you don't have a tight pussy?

JESSIE

I don't know. No one, I guess.

SCOTTY J.

So I was all, "What's your problem?"

And he was all, "Nothing." So I was

like . . . really . . . y'know . . . I was fuckin'

pissed, Amber. So then I was all,

like, "What are you gonna do?" Y'know?

And he was all, like acting tough,

y'know, with his friends around and stuff.

So I was just all . . . like . . . "Forget it."

And I walked away.

AMBER

Excuse me, Scotty.

FLOYD

The Colonel!

COLONEL

Floyd Gondolli, great you could make

it . . . great . . . great . . . great.

FLOYD

How are you? You look happy.

COLONEL

I'm fine.

FLOYD

Meet Boys: Tommy and Pete.

Meet Girls: Angie and Cyndi.

TOMMY/PETE/ANGIE/CYNDI

Hi.

COLONEL

Hello. Happy New Year.

FLOYD

These are the next stars . . . the real

people in the world.

COLONEL

I think we should do that talk with

Jack now, whadda 'ya say? Maybe iron

this thing out before we start the new year . . .

FLOYD

Let's do it.

FLOYD

Tommy-Pete-Angie-Cyndi. Uncle Floyd is gonna

split for a minute to do a little business talk.

DIRK

Hey, Amber.

AMBER

What are you talking about out here?

DIRK

Nothin'.

AMBER

Do you wanna come with me for a little while?

DIRK

Where?

AMBER

A surprise, surprise, surprise.

DIRK

Let's go.

JESSIE

Hey, Buck.

BUCK

Hey, Jessie, how ya doin'?

JESSIE

You sitting alone?

REED

Todd Parker.

TODD

Rockin' Reed Rothchild.

REED

You made it --

TODD

Yeah . . . yeah. This is an amazing party.

Fuckin' chicks everywhere.

REED

You bet.

TODD

I wouldn't mind havin' some of that

action over there --

REED

Want me to introduce you?

TODD

Sure. Introduce her to my lap.

REED

You got off work?

TODD

I don't dance Sunday nights.

Who's Corvette is that out in the driveway?

REED

It's Dirk's.

TODD

That car is jammin' -- Nosed, Racked,

Dual Camms, Ten Coats of Hand Gloss,

Candy Apple Red Laquer -- WHOA.

BUCK

I'm pretty happy with it . . .

JESSIE

. . . It's a great look for you, I think.

BUCK

It's sort of original, I think.

JESSIE

Right.

BUCK

What were we talking about before?

JESSIE

Um . . . oil painting . . . ?

BUCK

No . . . yes, I mean . . . but we were talkin'

about . . .

JESSIE

Oh! Oh! "Sunsets."

BUCK

Oh yeah! I was saying: I like sunsets too . . . but . . .

JESSIE

Sunrises are better.

BUCK

Exactly.

JESSIE

I thought I was the only one who thought that.

BUCK

I think that.

JESSIE

I never thought we'd have so much

in common, Buck.

BUCK

Yeah, yeah . . . hey, have you ever heard

of my stereo system?

JESSIE

No.

BUCK

Y'know I'm thinking of opening my

own business --

JESSIE

Really?

BUCK

It's my dream. Hi-Fi Stereo Equipment

at a discount price -- it's called

"Buck's Super Stereo World."

JESSIE

That's a fucking great idea.

FLOYD

. . . so let's talk about the future.

So let's talk about what video means

to this industry -- and let's talk

about how all of us -- not one of us --

but all of us will profit. I've been doing

theater work in San Francisco and San Diego

for as long as you've been doing stag

and hardcore, Jack.

JACK

I know you're history, Floyd.

COLONEL

No one's doubting your history

or your credentials, Floyd.

FLOYD

Then why the resistance? I mean:

This industry is going to be turned

upside down soon enough --

JACK

Then why help it?

FLOYD

Why not be prepared? The money comes

from the Colonel, the talent comes from

you, Jack. I've got a connection to the

equipment and the mail order distribution,

not to mention those kids I got out there

who are hot-fuck-action to the max.

This is the future. Video tape tells the truth.

JACK

I have a stable of actors and actresses.

They're professionals. They're not

a bunch of fucking amateurs. They're

proven box office and they get people

in theaters (where films should be seen)

and they know how to fuck well --

FLOYD

That's right, Jack and by that

same token, you're the one with the

power here. The video revolution

is upon us -- and our role is critical.

We have an obligation to use our resources

and talent to help make it fly --

JACK

You come in here, at my party, tell me about

this and that -- tell me about the future,

tell me about -- video and amateurs and

all that -- well lemme tell you something now:

I will not shoot films on video and no

I will not loan out my actors who are

under contract to me. Period.

FLOYD

Wait a minute, Jack. I'm not a complicated man.

I like cinema. In particular, I like to

see fucking on film. I don't want to win

an Oscar and I don't want to re-invent the

wheel -- I enjoy simple pleasures like butter

in my ass and lollipops in my mouth.

That's me -- call me crazy, call me a pervert,

but this is something I enjoy. One other

small thing I want to do in this life is make

a dollar and a cent in this business -- I'm not

trying to hurt you. I'm trying to help you stay

one step ahead of the game --

JACK

We're repeating ourselves now, Floyd.

COLONEL

Jack, I think this is about cost and future --

JACK

The future is as bright as we make it --

it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars

that can be saved shooting on video tape --

if it looks like shit and sounds like shit,

it probably is shit --

FLOYD

I think you're one gin past this conversation --

JACK

No . . . no. I'm crystal clear here.

COLONEL

Jack, please understand that this is

not an argument . . . this is a fact of --

JACK

. . . What . . . ?

COLONEL

This is not an argument, but a --

JACK

What are you saying?

COLONEL

What do you mean, Jack, c'mon --

JACK

Are you telling me that you're

working with this shit?

COLONEL

I think that there is a serious case

to be made for the price and the gamble

on the whole idea of a home video market --

Jack: Two, three years from now, everyone's

gonna be able to walk into their local

supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette --

JACK

True film fans won't watch that shit.

It doesn't look good and more importantly

it doesn't make sex look sexy.

COLONEL

It doesn't have to look good, Jack.

Film is just too damn expensive.

The theaters are already planning

converting to video projectors.

JACK

I haven't heard that.

FLOYD

It's true.

JACK

We've got ten minutes until the New

Year and I don't want it to start like this

so I'm leaving now. We will or we won't

continue this conversation some other time.

AMBER

I wanted you . . . to just . . . to come

in and give me a minute so I could

tell you how much I love you.

It's gonna be a new year and we're

gonna start things and do things

and I want you to know how much I

really care for you, honey. I care

for you so much . . . you're my little baby . . .

DIRK

Thank you, Amber.

AMBER

You're the best thing in the world

that's happened to me since my son

went off . . . and I just . . . I love you, honey.

DIRK

I love you too, Amber.

AMBER

Fucking 1980 . . . y'know? Can you believe it?

DIRK

I can't . . . it's like . . . next thing

we know . . . it's gonna be 1990, then

2000 . . . can you imagine?

AMBER

Goodbye to 1979 . . . hello to 1980 . . .

(handing him a straw)

Make sure you snort it back quick and hard . . .

DIRK

. . . wh . . . ?

AMBER

Really fast, like this . . .

DIRK

It burns.

AMBER

It's good, though, right?

DIRK

It's in my throat . . . uch . . .

AMBER

It's the drip . . . the drip's the best part.

DIRK

Tastes like aspirin.

AMBER

Do one more in the other nostril.

DIRK

. . . I need a glass of water, I think . . .

AMBER

One more, then the water.

DIRK

Do I look cool when I do it?

SCOTTY J.

DIRK

Oh, shit! Let's get back inside, come on --

SCOTTY J.

I'm sorry, Dirk. Please. I'm sorry.

DIRK

SCOTTY J.

You look at me sometimes --

DIRK

SCOTTY J.

I wanna know if you like me.

DIRK

SCOTTY J.

Can I kiss you?

DIRK

. . . Scott . . . I don't --

SCOTTY J.

Please. Please let me.

DIRK

No.

SCOTTY J.

I'm really sorry. I didn't mean

to grab you . . . I didn't --

DIRK

It's alright.

SCOTTY J.

. . . I'm sorry . . .

DIRK

. . . it's alright.

SCOTTY J.

Do you wanna kiss me?

DIRK

Scotty.

SCOTTY J.

No, no. Forget it. I'm sorry.

I'm really sorry, I'm just drunk.

I'm outta my head, okay?

DIRK

. . . yeah --

SCOTTY J.

I'm just crazy, you know? Crazy. Right?

I'm so wasted, drunk, drunk --

DIRK

You wanna go back inside?

SCOTTY J.

Do you like my car, Dirk?

DIRK

What . . . ? Yeah. Yeah.

SCOTTY J.

I wanted to make sure you thought it

was cool or else I was gonna take it back.

DIRK

Oh.

SCOTTY J.

(to himself)

I love you, Dirk.

JACK

WE GOT TWO MINUTES, PEOPLE! TWO MINUTES!

LITTLE BILL'S WIFE

PARTY PEOPLE

10 . . . 9 . . . 8 . . . 7 . . .

PARTY PEOPLE

. . . 6 . . . 5 . . . 4 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . .

PARTY PEOPLE (OC)

. . . HAPPY NEW YEAR!

"80s"

AMBER (OC)

. . . what about your character,

"Brock Landers," and what some people

might consider violent attitudes towards women?

DIRK

violence . . . ? No, what? I mean, if there's

something in this series of movies that's

like action or violence or whatever -- that's

the movie. Y'know? Look: I'm not saying that

these movies are for the whole family, but they've

gotalotta action and sometimes the characters

are women who are -- say -- spies or drug

smugglers or working for some organization

that my character is trying to . . . defeat.

We've made twenty of these films in the past

um . . . um . . . five years, since 77 . . . and this kind

of talk has only come up in the past year

or so . . . I mean: What's the problem? So -- y'know.

AMBER (VO)

If Brock Landers is slick with a gun, he does

so only in the vein of good and right.

Brock protects the values of the American ideal

and fights for causes that instill pride

in a society where morals are hard to come by --

DIRK

WHO SENT YOU?

KC SUNSHINE

GET THE FUCK OFF ME, ASSHOLE.

DIRK

LAY STILL, I'LL PUNCH YOU IN THE GODDAMN FACE.

KC SUNSHINE

FUCK OFF.

DIRK

I'm onna ask once more and

I'm onna ask you nice . . . WHERE THE

FUCK IS RINGO, YOU BITCH?

BECKY

Fuck you.

BECKY

Ohhh . . . do it again, mayble I'll

get my pussy wet next time.

BUCK

HEY CRACKERJACK, WATCHYOU DOIN' WIT MY WOMAN?

REED

Make another move, motherfucker

and give me a good goddamn reason

to blow you away!

DIRK

BLOCK . . . uh . . . an idea or a movement.

Jack will put the final touches on what

the camera needs for editing -- but, uh --

He allows me to block my own sex scenes.

. . . and . . . he gives me flexibility to work

with the character and develop, y'know . . .

I don't know of any other directors

that would let an actor -- uh -- do that.

JACK

I don't let you block your own sex scenes.

AMBER (OC)

For Dirk Diggler, the future is something

to look forward to, not to fear . . . He is

a creative man of many interests . . . film,

poetry, karate, music and dance . . . he is a man

of passion and mystery . . . He Is A Man Of Lust.

AMBER

It's my poem to you.

DIRK

It's great. It's so great, Amber.

You're a director now. Shit.

Have you showed Jack?

AMBER

Just you. I wanted to show you first.

DIRK

It's so fuckin' good. Really.

(beat)

Maybe you might want to think about

cutting that part when Jack says that

thing about -- y'know --

AMBER

Blocking the sex --

DIRK

-- yeah.

JACK

How was it?

JACK

Hello? Colonel? Wait, wait, wait.

Yes. Calm down. Calm down. Okay.

Right Now -- Yes -- Right Now.

COLONEL

. . . she was fifteen . . . fifteen . . . I didn't

know . . . Jack, you gotta believe me.

JACK

I believe you.

COLONEL

I told her not to do so much coke, but she

wouldn't listen, she just kept doing it and

doing it like she was a vacuum. Like she had

a vacuum in her nose or something . . . .

. . . next thing I know . . . she's got blood

coming from her nose and . . . jesus . . . her, jesus --

JACK

What?

COLONEL

It was coming out her ass, Jack.

JACK

Okay. It's gonna be okay. Just relax.

The bail is a hundred thousand dollars.

I don't have that kind of cash --

COLONEL

-- I don't have any money left.

JACK

What do you mean? Nothing?

JACK

Well . . . what . . . how?

COLONEL

I spent it . . . I spent it.

JACK

The films . . . or . . . I mean?

COLONEL

I spent it, alright? This shit gets

expensive. Between you shooting film,

the coke, the limos, the houses.

It goes, alright? I spent it.

JACK

Alright, okay. Don't worry.

COLONEL

I can't have this happen to me.

I'm a good man, right?

JACK

Yes you are.

COLONEL

I didn't know -- I didn't know she was

gonna die right there with me or I wouldn't

have picked her up.

JACK

Right. You know; you've done nothing wrong.

I mean, look; You were just there, right?

You didn't . . . I mean . . . you didn't do anything.

COLONEL

They found something in my house, Jack.

JACK

What?

COLONEL

. . . something . . .

JACK

. . . what are you saying? What did they find?

COLONEL

. . . it's my fuckin' weakness, Jack.

They're . . . so small and cute I can't help

myself, Jack. I can't help it when they're so

small and cute. I just want to watch, I don't do

anything, Jack. I've never touched one of them . . .

JACK

Jesus Christ, Colonel.

COLONEL

You look at me like I'm an asshole, now.

JACK

. . . I . . . I don't . . . ?

COLONEL

I'm going to jail for a long time.

JACK

-- it's okay, Colonel. It's gonna be

fine in the end . . . . I promise . . .

COLONEL

Are you promising me?

COLONEL

Take it back, Jack. Don't promise me anything.

You can't help me. I'm done. I'm going to jail.

I've done wrong and I'm going to jail for a long, long time.

COLONEL

Listen to me, Jack: And I'm gonna tell

you this for you. Am I your friend?

JACK

What?

COLONEL

Answer me, am I your friend?

JACK

Yes.

COLONEL

So remember that I'm your friend and

listen to what I tell you now: Give in, Jack.

You've gotta give. For you, for your business

and your livelihood -- accept the future.

Don't fight it, because you can't win.

Look for the new blood, go to Floyd Gondolli,

go to video, give up your battle -- the

filmmaking is over, Jack.

JACK

Well there we go.

KURT LONGJOHN

Yeah.

ROCKY

Lot of stuff on there to learn.

JACK

That's it.

KURT LONGJOHN

No turning back now.

JACK

The future.

KURT LONGJOHN

That's right.

ROCKY

The quality is, uh --

JACK

It's not what we're used to.

KURT LONGJOHN

We can make it work, I think.

ROCKY

It's . . . potential . . .

KURT LONGJOHN

Yes.

JACK

You can't beat the price.

KURT LONGJOHN

No you can't.

JACK

This is the future and we can't deny

it anymore because the past is too expensive.

KURT LONGJOHN

I'm scared.

ROCKY

Me too.

JACK

It's gonna make us rich.

KURT LONGJOHN

Yep.

ROCKY

It's a rather pretty thing, isn't it?

KURT LONGJOHN

We can still tell good stories, Jack.

JACK

No. It's about jacking off now, Kurt.

No more stories . . . that's over.

BECKY

I do.

JEROME

I do too.

BECKY

They made Jerome regional manager

of the new "Pep Boys," they're building

in Bakersfield. We're gonna move there.

Buy a house.

REED

That's great, guys. That's so great.

JEROME

It's gonna be a great opportunity to run

the store my way. Y'know. Get those guys

off my back and run the store my way.

JACK

. . . and it's tough is what I'm saying.

JOHNNY DOE

Right.

JACK

Hey, Dirk -- here you are. You havin'

a good time?

DIRK

Uh-huh.

(re: Johnny Doe)

Who's this?

JOHNNY DOE

Hi . . . I'm Johnny Doe. You're Dirk

Diggler -- it's great to meet you.

JACK

Dirk, meet Johnny Doe . . . New Kid On The

Block. He's interested in the business.

JACK

He's pretty tired, Johnny. He's also shy.

Anyway: What I'm saying to you is this:

It costs money, you got ten, fifteen people

standing around, and that's just to make

sure the lighting is right --

ROLLERGIRL

This stuff burns.

DIRK

It's crystal.

ROLLERGIRL

That's why. Shit, why didn't you

tell me -- you don't need to do that much --

You only have to do bumps with crystal.

DIRK

Yeah, well . . . mind your own business

or get your own or whatever --

ROLLERGIRL

You don't have to be mean about it.

MAURICE

Hey . . . Rollergirl . . . hey.

ROLLERGIRL

MAURICE

ROLLERGIRL

Really small.

ROLLERGIRL

Well . . . uh . . . so?

MAURICE

So I can't do this.

ROLLERGIRL

Can you get a boner?

MAURICE

I don't think so.

ROLLERGIRL

Well . . .

MAURICE

Please. Can you help me?

ROLLERGIRL

How?

MAURICE

I dunno.

ROLLERGIRL

If you've got a small dick,

there's really nothing I can do, Maurice.

MAURICE

. . . right . . . right . . .

ROLLERGIRL

Just go for it, man.

MAURICE

What do you mean?

ROLLERGIRL

Just go for it . . . who cares if you've got

a small dick. It's how you use it, right?

You can get a boner, I bet. I know you can.

MAURICE

I guess.

ROLLERGIRL

Be a man about it.

MAURICE

Right. Right. I have to be a man about it.

I have to do this . . . I have to show my brothers

in Puerto Rico the lifestyle that I'm living.

I can do it . . . I can do it.

ROLLERGIRL

You'll do fine.

MAURICE

Right.

ROLLERGIRL

JACK

I've seen you push thirteen inches, you'd be

lucky if you could manage six today -- all the coke

DIRK

DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT ME LIKE THAT, JACK.

JACK

Alright: You're fired. Okay?

ENGINEER

So . . . what do you think?

DIRK

Well I think that . . . maybe we could

speed it up a little -- it's --

ENGINEER

It's a ballad. I thought that --

DIRK

We'll just speed it up a couple octaves.

. . . cause that might make it cooler,

people like it when slow songs . . . y'know . . .

when they're a little fast . . . it's cooler.

AMATEUR

Is he gonna fuck me in the ass?

JACK

Is that what you want?

AMATEUR

It would be nice.

JACK

Johnny: Fuck her in the ass.

JOHNNY DOE

Lock and Load, Jack.

BECKY

No, baby, please, please --

BANK WORKER

Mr. Swope?

BUCK

Yeah, that's me. Hello.

BANK WORKER

You have a copy of your loan application?

BUCK

Yes I do.

BANK WORKER

Good. You wanna follow me?

AMBER

I was gonna take a poetry class at

Everywoman's Village --

ROLLERGIRL

Oh, oh. I wanna do that.

AMBER

We'll do it then. It's Monday,

Wednesday, Friday at three.

ROLLERGIRL

Do you think I should -- I was thinking something?

AMBER

What?

ROLLERGIRL

I was gonna see about taking the GED.

Do you know what that is?

AMBER

For High School, to graduate?

ROLLERGIRL

Yeah. It's like -- so I can get my

diploma -- 'cause I feel bad that I

never did it. I think you were right.

I think you're right --

AMBER

You should do it. That would be great

for you -- you know -- cause if you

wanted, Rollergirl, you could do anything.

TODD

I'm back.

DIRK

Perfect timing.

MAURICE (VO)

Dear brothers: Here's an example

of me with women in Los Angeles.

I sleep with women here all the time . . .

BROTHER #1

(in Spanish, sub-titled)

Oh my God --

BROTHER #2

(in Spanish, sub-titled)

-- it's so . . . so . . . it looks like a peanut.

BUCK

That's what Buck's Super Stereo World

is all about -- the customer. People wanna

know what they're getting into technically

and I have the specific technical hi-fi

background to answer any technical question

that someone might have -- I've been into

sound equipment for long enough to know what

a guy wants when he walks right in the door --

and that's the personal touch that Buck's Super

Stereo World is gonna have --

AMBER

I miss my two sons -- my little Andrew

and my Dirk -- I miss them both so much.

I always felt like Dirk was my baby, my new baby.

Don't you miss Dirk?

ROLLERGIRL

Yeah.

AMBER

He's so fucking talented. The bastard.

I love him, Rollergirl, I mean; I really

love the little jerk.

ROLLERGIRL

I love you, Mom. I want you to be

my mother, Amber. Are you my Mom?

I'll ask you if you're my mother and

you say, "yes." OK? -- Are you my mother -- ?

AMBER

Yes, honey. Yes.

DIRK

C'mon, man, c'mon, c'mon, alright --

MANAGER

I can't let you take the tapes until

the bill is paid in full.

DIRK

That makes a lot of sense.

REED

Wait, wait, wait. How can he pay

the price of the demo if he can't

take the demo tapes to a record company?

MANAGER

That's not my problem. My job is to

collect payment before we hand over the tapes.

REED

You can't get a record contract if

the record company can't hear what you've got.

DIRK

OK: Wait a minute -- have you heard my tape?

Huh? Have you heard it? I'm guaranteed

to get a record deal because my stuff is so good.

Once that happens, I'll pay you --

MANAGER

It's not gonna happen. This is a Catch-22,

I understand. You're saying this thing

and I get it but I just won't let it happen.

DIRK

A catch-what?

AMBER

I don't wanna do this anymore, honey.

I can't. I just can't.

ROLLERGIRL

What?

AMBER

Have fun now, let's keep going and going

and going tonight -- because it's over.

There's too many things --

ROLLERGIRL

Okay. Okay.

AMBER

Let's go walk.

ROLLERGIRL

I don't wanna leave the room.

AMBER

Me either. OHHHHHHH. I love you, honey.

ROLLERGIRL

I love you, Mom.

BANK WORKER

Mr. Swope . . . we can't help you.

BUCK

. . . I have all the papers, all the

things in order, yes? I mean, it's all --

BANK WORKER

Yes. But we can't give you a loan. I'm sorry.

BUCK

. . . why . . . ?

BANK WORKER

. . . Mr. Swope: You're a pornographer.

And this bank is not in business to

support pornography --

BUCK

I'm not a pornographer, I'm an actor.

BANK WORKER

I'm sorry.

BUCK

No, no, no, please. This is . . . this is

a new business for me, a real thing

that I want to do and a real thing that

I can do, please, I mean -- this is not a joke --

BANK WORKER

I'm sorry.

BUCK

Please, now, please, just wait one minute

here -- because there's gotta be some way --

BANK WORKER

. . . I'm sorry . . .

BUCK

Well this is not fair --

BANK WORKER

This financial institution can't endorse

pornography, you've got to understand --

BUCK

I'm an actor.

BANK WORKER

Please. Now I'm sorry.

OFFICER

Jack Horner?

JACK

Yeah, what is it?

OFFICER

There was an accident yesterday --

REED

Oh, fuck, Dirk.

DIRK

What?

REED

You know that kid Johnny Doe?

DIRK

No.

REED

Y'know, the kid from --

DIRK

What about him?

REED

He died. He got in a car accident.

Couple nights ago . . . and he died.

He like, went through the windshield

or something. Fuckin' shit. Dead.

DIRK

For real?

REED

Yeah. He's dead. Can you believe that?

DIRK

That's gotta hurt, goin' through a windshield.

It's tough luck.

DIRK

Hello? Becky? Becky -- what? What?

BECKY

I think Jerome is gonna kill me, Dirk.

Please. Please come and help me.

DIRK

Well . . . where are you, I don't know

where you are --

BECKY

I need you to save me, Dirk --

if he catches me on the phone, I'm dead.

DIRK

Tell me where you are.

BECKY

. . . okay . . . okay . . . OH SHIT. He's

coming in -- okay -- okay -- meet

me at Denny's in Bakersfield --

on Colfax Blvd. Please hurry.

DIRK

Okay. I'm comin' right now, right now.

I'm comin' right now to kick some ass, Becky.

BECKY

Please don't do anything to me, Jerome.

Please. Please. I ask.

JEROME

Think you're Miss Fuckin' Movie Star with

a dick in your mouth? Huh? You're gonna

tell me -- tell it to me or I'm gonna break

your fuckin' jaw.

BECKY

I don't know what you want me --

JEROME

-- I want you to tell me that you liked

getting fucked by those men in those movies.

I want you to tell me that you loved getting

shit in your face -- YOU FUCKIN' SAY IT, CUNT.

BECKY

. . . I liked it . . .

JEROME

Do you like big dicks?

BECKY

I don't know what you want me to --

JEROME

SAY IT.

BECKY

Yes.

REED

Where you goin'?

DIRK

Gotta go kick some ass, man.

BECKY

DON'T -- YOU -- EVER -- TOUCH -- ME.

PEDESTRIAN

You alright, pal?

DIRK

My fuckin' car, my car . . . my Corvette.

PEDESTRIAN

Holy shit, you slammed right into this --

PEDESTRIAN

I don't think you should dirve this car.

DIRK

Fuck you.

MR. BROWN

Are you alright, ma'am?

BECKY

What?

MR. BROWN

Are you going to be alright?

You seem . . . you've been sitting there.

A while now. And I want to know if

you're going to be alright.

MR. BROWN

Do you want to order something? A bowl of soup?

BECKY

My friend was supposed to come

here and get me, but he hasn't come.

MR. BROWN

Yes. Well, why don't you let me buy you

some soup while you wait for your friend?

BECKY

No. No. I'm not hungry.

MR. BROWN

Please. Please. I want to help you.

This is not . . . this is something . . . you see,

an act of kindness, I'm trying to do

something good . . . to help you . . . for no

other reason . . . other than . . . just to help.

MR. BROWN

Why don't you try calling you friend?

MR. BROWN (OC)

Use the quarter, young lady.

REED

How fast were you going?

DIRK

Fuck, I dunno. Ninety.

SCOTTY J.

Ninety miles an hour?

DIRK

Shit, yeah. I'm lucky I'm not dead.

TODD

This is a lot of damage.

REED

At least it's driveable.

DIRK

It's nove driveable, look at it.

DIRK

Just let it ring, we gotta deal with this --

REED

At least it still works, Dirk.

DIRK

You can't just drive a Corvette down

the street looking like that, Reed.

C'mon, man. Be reasonable.

REED

How you gonna pay for it?

DIRK

-- I'll find a way to pay for it.

This is top priority, Reed:

My car has got to get fixed.

TODD

It could be like two/three thousand

dollars worth of damage, Dirk.

DIRK

So?

TODD

I dunno.

DIRK

We gotta get those fuckin' demo tapes, too.

I mean it . . . let's go kick that guy's ass

or something . . . if we could get those demo

tapes, then we get the record deal, then

the Vette gets fixed. You cannot drive

a Corvette down the street looking like this,

you just can't.

BECKY

I don't know where to go. I don't

have anywhere to go, I can't get anywhere.

MR. BROWN

It's alright. It's alright, young lady.

BECKY

I'm so sorry to make you hear this.

MR. BROWN

I want to help you.

BECKY

No, I can't.

MR. BROWN

You need help. You need someplace to

sleep and to wash. I want to help you.

BECKY

You're a nice man.

JUDGE

Hello. You must be Maggie?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

I'm Kathleen O'Malley. The judge.

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

You have a lawyer with you?

AMBER

No. I don't. I do not.

LAWYER

Hello, Judge.

JUDGE

You've been divorced for six years.

AMBER

Yes. Since 1977.

JUDGE

(to lawyer)

And the agreement on the money settlement

was taken care of?

LAWYER

Yes.

JUDGE

So. What we're talking about then

is coming to an agreement on custody of Andrew?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

What was decided during the divorce?

LAWYER

Initially, Andrew went with his father,

and visitation was given to his mother on --

(looks at a paper)

from Saturday Noon to Sunday at seven.

With his mother entitled to bring Andrew

to her home or any reasonable place.

JUDGE

(to Amber)

Was that the understanding?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

And why wasn't that visiting privilege honored?

THOMAS

Well, it was for a time --

AMBER

I only saw him twice.

THOMAS

It said, "reasonable place," and I didn't

think a house of drugs and prostitution

and pornography was that.

JUDGE

I'm sorry, what is it that you --

THOMAS

My ex-wife is involved in the pornography

business -- I didn't think that environment

was a safe place for my son.

AMBER

This is not right. My son was never

exposed to pornographic material or

drugs or any of these things, my husband

just assumed --

THOMAS

I saw it with my own eye.

JUDGE

Did you register this as a complaint?

LAWYER

My client didn't officially register,

but I think the circumstance called

for something immediate -- for the

safety of the child.

JUDGE

How old is the boy now?

THOMAS

He's twelve.

AMBER

He'll be thirteen next month.

JUDGE

Where do you live now?

THOMAS

We live in Long Beach. I have a job

there and my new wife is home with him.

(pause)

You see, the problem is, Judge, is that

my ex-wife is a sick . . . she is a very sick

person and she needs help. She deals in

drugs and sex for a living --

AMBER

I don't do drugs.

LAWYER

Your honor, she has been in and out

of trouble with the law on quite a few

occasions regarding this sort of thing.

AMBER

No. No. Not anymore

JUDGE (OC)

Have you ever been arrested?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE (OC)

When was the last time you were

arrested . . . what was the charge . . . ?

JACK (into CAMERA)

Okay, okay, okay. Welcome to the experiment.

This is Jack Horner, coming to you from the

inside of a limousine that at this moment

is heading West down Ventura Blvd. I have

with me -- a little princess in the world

of adult film -- the lovely Miss Rollergirl.

ROLLERGIRL

Hello, hello, howdy.

JACK

Are you ready to do what we're gonna do?

ROLLERGIRL

Ready, ready. Ready like Freddy.

JACK

We are On The Lookout. That's what

we'll call this -- On The Lookout.

We're just gonna drive on down Ventura,

heading west, like I said -- and see

what we find. Maybe we find some new,

young stud who wants to take a shot

and get hot and heavy with Rollergirl

back here in the limo -- and we'll capture

it on video. This is a first, ladies and

gentleman. A first in porn history.

Who knows what could happen . . . ?

Maybe we come across some guy, maybe some girl?

See if they'd like to get soft and sticky?

DIRK

Where the fuck is Todd?

REED

C'mon, Dirk, seriously --

DIRK

What? I dunno, okay? Okay. I don't know.

REED

We have to sell your car.

DIRK

I will not do it, Reed.

REED

What else is there to do, Dirk?

Huh? We have nothing left.

DIRK

I worked way too fucking hard for

that car . . . what am I supposed to do . . . ?

REED

It solves all our problems.

DIRK

I will not sell my Corvette: Simple as that.

Where the fuck is Todd? Where are my jeans?

SCOTTY J.

What are you looking for?

DIRK

My jeans --

SCOTTY J.

The cool ones with the thing?

DIRK

All my jeans are cool, Scotty.

SCOTTY

Sorry.

TODD

Got it.

DIRK

Where the fuck have you been?

TODD

Getting some shit . . .

DIRK

What the fuck is that?

TODD

What?

DIRK

Those are my jeans, Todd. I've

been looking for those.

TODD

You said I could borrow them.

DIRK

I never said that.

TODD

I thought you did.

SCOTTY J.

Can I come with you, Dirk?

DIRK

Give me my fuckin' jeans back, Todd. Seriously.

TODD

Sorry.

REED

Dirk, please -- we gotta deal with

this money situation.

DIRK

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SCOTTY J.

Where are you goin', Dirk?

DIRK

Goin' out.

SCOTTY J.

Can I go with you?

JACK

What do you say?

COLLEGE KID

I dunno -- you mean it.

JACK

Anything you wanna do -- you do it.

Do you see this young lady here?

COLLEGE KID

Yeah.

JACK

You like what you see?

COLLEGE KID

Sure.

JACK

Then get in here and do what you want.

JACK

You a student?

COLLEGE KID

Um . . . um . . . yeah.

JACK

Oh, great. Where do you go to school?

COLLEGE KID

Um . . . uh . . . do I have to say?

JACK

No, no. Anyway. How'd you like to go round

with Rollergirl? Have you seen her film work?

COLLEGE KID

. . . yeah . . . yeah I have.

(to Rollergirl)

We watch your films in my frat house.

I go to CSUN. The fuckin' guys are never

gonna believe this --

JACK

Alright . . . fantastic cool . . .

COLLEGE KID

I think we met once before, actually.

ROLLERGIRL

Really?

COLLEGE KID

I know you . . . we went to school together.

We went to high school together.

. . . you're Brandy, right? Brandy's your name.

FIGURE

Hello.

DIRK

Hey.

FIGURE

Are you waiting for someone?

DIRK

. . . yeah. I'm waiting for someone.

I'm not sure if they're gonna show up though.

FIGURE

You wanna wait in the car?

SURFER

I'm Joe.

DIRK

Dirk.

(beat)

Do you know who I am?

SURFER

. . . No . . .

DIRK

My name is Dirk Diggler.

SURFER

No . . . I mean . . . you're a guy . . . I'm

helping you out . . . .

DIRK

Yeah.

SURFER

So . . . what do you want to do?

DIRK

I'm . . . it's what you want.

SURFER

. . . I wanna watch you. I mean, I'm not gay.

I just wanna. Maybe you can jerk off

a little and I can watch. Maybe I'll join

in, but for now I just wanna watch.

DIRK

Twenty bucks.

SURFER

Ten is all I have . . .

JACK

Alright, there, pal; make it look

good, make it sexy -- don't just ram

your way up and in there --

JACK

Hey, hey, hey . . . take it slow and

make it kinky, kid. C'mon.

Think of Miss Lovely Rollergirl

as a beautiful instrument that you

need to play . . . c'mon now . . . slow down . . .

Pretend you're just a wonderful stud,

pretend you're a wonderful stud that's

just ready to melt her pussy . . . hey, kid . . . ?

Are you listening to me? Hey -- hey --

COLLEGE KID

Just let me do my thing, man.

JACK

Cut. Stop. Cut.

ROLLERGIRL

This is stupid, Jack.

JACK

I know . . . this isn't working out.

COLLEGE KID

That's it?

JACK (OC)

Yeah, that's all. Sorry for the inconvenience.

COLLEGE KID

You got me hard -- you could at least

jack me off or something, lady.

ROLLERGIRL

What the fuck did you say?

COLLEGE KID

It's not so cool to leave me

with a hard on.

ROLLERGIRL

Fuck you.

COLLEGE KID

Nice life you've got here. Should

be proud of what you've become . . .

COLLEGE KID

Your fuckin' films suck now anyway.

SURFER

. . . holy shit . . . that's nice . . . that's . . . big . . .

SURFER

Why don't you jerk it a little,

get it hard? I wanna see it get hard.

SURFER

. . . maybe . . . do it harder . . .

SURFER

Get your hand wet.

DIRK

. . . be quiet . . .

SURFER

. . . c'mon . . . c'mon . . . c'mon . . .

DIRK

I can't . . . I can't get it hard . . . I can't.

I'm sorry --

SURFER

You shouldn't do this sort of thing, faggot.

JACK

YOU HAVE SOME FUCKING RESPECT.

YOU LITTLE PRICK. YOU HAVE SOME GODDAMN

RESPECT FOR THAT GIRL. SHE'S A STAR,

A WONDERFUL CHILD AND A STAR. You think

you're worthy to fuck her -- you're not

worthy to TOUCH her -- the way you fuck --

who taught you? WHO TAUGHT YOU HOW TO FUCK

THAT WAY? YOU'RE AN AMATEUR. AN AMATEUR.

ROLLERGIRL

YOU -- DON'T -- EVER -- DISRESPECT -- ME.

SURFERS

Little Fuckin' Fag. Donkey-Dick.

You don't do this. You don't.

BUCK

What do you want, honey?

JESSIE

I want . . . um . . . apple fritter . . . Jelly . . .

And uh . . . chocolate with sprinkles . . . and

a bear claw, too . . .

BUCK

How's my little kung-fu fighter?

JESSIE

He's kicking ass inside my stomach.

BUCK

That's a boy.

DONUT BOY

Can I help you?

BUCK

Yeah . . . I'm gonna get a dozen . . .

BUCK

Lemme get two bear claws . . . apple fritter . . .

Two chocolate . . . two sprinkles . . . gimme

some of those glazed . . . how many is that?

PUERTO RICAN KID

Empty the safe. Behind the soda machine.

BUCK

Jesus Christ.

PUERTO RICAN KID

Don't talk . . . shut the fuck up . . .

(aims back at Donut Boy)

Okay . . . empty the safe . . .

TODD

Alright. I think this could be the thing.

Something to help us score a little extra cash.

I think if we decide to do this, we gotta

be one hundred percent.

REED

I agree.

TODD

This guy's name is Rahad Jackson.

He's got more money than God and twice

as much coke, crack and smack. He'll buy

just about anything anybody wants to sell him.

He just likes people hanging out at his house

and partying.

DIRK

How do you know him?

TODD

He used to come into Party Boys

once in a while. Mutrix introduced me --

DIRK

And how would we do it, exactly?

I mean, how would it all go down?

TODD

It's like this: I call him up,

tell him I got half a key of quality stuff.

REED

Do you have his phone number?

TODD

Yeah. So we call him up, give him the price.

DIRK

How much?

TODD

Half a key for like . . . five thousand bucks.

Split it three ways --

DIRK

That's enough to get my Vette fixed.

TODD

That's right. So we set up the deal,

dump half a kilo of baking soda in a

bag and walk over to his house -- BOOM.

Right there -- this could be a nifty bit

o' hustle-bustle.

REED

Do you have his address?

TODD

Fuckin', Reed, yeah I have his address, c'mon.

DIRK

What if he tests it out?

TODD

He won't.

DIRK

How do you know?

TODD

I know he won't. I'm positive. Believe me.

REED

It's a pretty good idea.

DIRK

I think we should go for it.

SCOTTY J.

You guys should be careful with this.

DIRK

Scotty?

SCOTTY J.

What?

DIRK

Just . . . y'know . . . mind yer own business.

SCOTTY J.

Sorry.

DIRK

Okay.

TODD

You guys ready for this?

REED

I am.

TODD

Dirk?

DIRK

Me? Yeah . . . yeah, I'm ready. I was born ready.

TODD

Alright.

DIRK

What the fuck is that?

TODD

It's a big gun.

DIRK

I know, but why?

TODD

Just in case, just in case. Let's go.

REED

I'm nervous.

TODD

It'll be okay.

REED

Let's get in and out, in and out.

TODD

Not too quick -- that looks suspicious.

Lemme do the talking --

BODYGUARD

Hello. Come on in.

RAHAD

Hello, friends. Which one is Todd?

TODD

That's me. We met before at the club --

RAHAD

Oh, yeah. Come on in here.

TODD

These are my friends Dirk and Reed.

RAHAD

Great to meet you. You guys want something

to drink -- or a pill -- or some coke --

or some dope?

DIRK/REED/TODD

No thank you, thanks, no.

RAHAD

So what do we have, we have, something, yeah?

TODD

Here it is . . . half a key . . . it's really good,

if you wanna test it out --

RAHAD

Oh, wait a minute, I love this part:

(sings along)

"SISTER CHRISTIAN, THERE'S SO MUCH

IN LIFE, DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP BEFORE

YOUR TIME IS DUE . . . IT'S TRUE!"

(to Dirk)

This song is so amazing.

Anyway: What's the price?

TODD

We were thinking five thousand.

RAHAD

That's good. No problem, cool, cool.

RAHAD

You wanna play baseball?

DIRK/REED/TODD

No thank you.

RAHAD (OC)

Check this out --

RAHAD

SISTER CHRISTIAN -- OH THE TIME HAS

COME . . . AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE

THE ONLY ONE TO SAY . . . OK . . .

RAHAD

I put a mix tape together of all

my favorite songs . . . This is song number

three . . . I love putting mix tapes together,

you know . . . if you buy an album or tape or

something, those guys put the songs in their

order and they try and say how you should listen

to the songs, but I don't like that.

I don't like to be told what to listen

to, when to listen to or anything . . .

RAHAD

(to Dirk/Reed/Todd)

He's Chinese . . . he loves to set

off firecrackers . . .

RAHAD

I CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING ANY LONGER

AND YET I'M STILL AFRAID TO LET IT FLOW.

WHAT STARTED OUT AS FRIENDSHIP HAS GROWN

STRONGER -- I ONLY WISH I HAD THE STRENGTH

TO LET IT SHOW --

DIRK

Well . . . I think maybe . . . we better get going --

RAHAD

No, stay. Hang out. We'll party.

DIRK

No, we really gotta split.

We have to be somewhere and we --

TODD

We're Not Leaving Yet.

TODD

We're here now and we want something else.

Hey -- Hey. We Want Something Else From You.

RAHAD

What?

DIRK

Todd -- what the hell are you doing?

TODD

In the master bedroom, under the bed,

in a floor safe . . . You understand?

DIRK

Todd . . . what the fuck, man, c'mon --

TODD

Shut up, Dirk. I told you I got a plan.

I got a good plan.

RAHAD

Are you kiddin' me kittie?

TODD

No I'm not. I'm not kidding. We want

what's in the safe. We want what's in

the safe in the floor under the bed in

the master bedroom.

DIRK

Todd -- don't be crazy.

(to Rahad)

Sir -- we don't know anything about this.

This is not the thing that we wanted.

TODD

SHUT THE FUCK UP, DIRK.

TODD

Don't reach for your gun.

RAHAD

You don't wanna do this, friendly.

TODD

You've only got one bullet.

DIRK

WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, TODD?

TODD

He went in the bedroom.

DIRK

ARE YOU CRAZY? WHEN DID YOU GO CRAZY?

TODD

He's got cash and coke in the safe

under the bed -- if we leave here

without it we're fools.

REED

Let's just split, let's just split

right now, Todd. Don't be stupid.

This wasn't part of the deal.

TODD

I'm goin' in that bedroom and get what's

in that safe. Are you coming?

DIRK

Fuck no. Todd. Don't. Don't do it.

RAHAD

C'mon out, little puppies. You want to

come and see, come and see, to get what

is coming down. Coming down.

DIRK

Fuck -- Fuck -- Fuck.

RAHAD

What the fuck . . . what the fuck . . . what the fuck.

RAHAD

It's coming down, coming down.

SHERYL LYNN

DIRK

TELL ME RIGHT NOW, YOU.

SHERYL LYNN

Eddie, it was out of the blue

and there was a man and he was speeding and

he was drunk and they didn't --

SHERYL LYNN

It was just some drunk kid, Eddie.

DIRK

SHERYL LYNN

My husband and I bought this house.

DIRK

Why? Why did you do that?

SHERYL LYNN

Eddie, please --

DIRK

This is my house. THIS IS MY HOUSE.

What the fuck? What the fuck are you

doing here? I don't want to see you,

I need to see my mother. I want my mother.

DIRK

lemme talk to him . . . Reed . . . yeah. Yeah.

(beat)

Are you sure . . . ? Yeah, okay . . . in a little . . .

SHERYL LYNN

Is everything alright?

SHERYL LYNN

You made something of yourself, Eddie.

SHERYL LYNN

I have all of your tapes . . . I've seen

all of your films . . . I knew you'd do

something special with it . . .

DIRK

Can you please help me?

JACK

It's alright, boy. It's alright.

BUCK

Did I hear somebody say DEALS?

BUCK

This weekend and this weekend only

Buck's Super Cool Stereo World is making

Super-Cool Deals on ALL name brands.

BUCK

We're open, we're ready -- all you

AMBER

Cut. Excellent.

COLONEL

TYRONE

Yes, Colonel.

COLONEL

ROLLERGIRL

JACK

Are you going deaf? Turn the music down --

ROLLERGIRL

Jack, I can't hear a word you're saying.

JACK

Just do me a favor and make it work, Buck.

BUCK

Did I talk to you about the modification

you're gonna need?

JACK

Don't. Don't do it, Buck.

BUCK

Jack -- you stick with the bass

you got and it's not gonna be loud.

JACK

I don't listen to it loud, alright?

I just wanna hear something, okay?

JACK

Look at this, he's a swimmer!

JESSIE

(to the baby)

Can you say hello to your Uncle Jack?

JACK

(to Jessie)

He's not gonna piss in the pool, is he?

JESSIE

I don't think so.

AMBER

Are we ready?

JACK

Plenty of time.

AMBER

What are you looking at?

JACK

I'm looking at you, my darling.

AMBER

You're staring.

JACK

You're the foxiest bitch I've ever known.

DIRK

I've been around this block twice

looking for something . . . a clue.

I've been looking for clues and something

led me back here . . . yeah . . . so here I am.

(beat)

Coulda been me who was at

Ringo's place when the shit went down . . .

(beat)

Hey . . . I know how it is . . . cause I been

there . . . we've all done bad things . . . .

We all have those guilty feelings in

our hearts . . . you wanna take your

brain out of your head and wash it and

scrub it and make it clean . . . well no.

(beat)

But I'm gonna help you settle this . . .

(beat)

First we're gonna check for holes,

see what we can find . . . then we're

gonna get nice and wet . . . so you're

gonna spread your legs . . .

(beat)

That's good . . . so you know me, you

know my reputation . . . thirteen

inches is a tough load, I don't

treat you gently . . . That's right:

I'm Brock Landers.

(beat)

So I'm gonna be nice and I'm gonna

ask you one more time . . .

(beat)

Where the fuck is Ringo?

DIRK

I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star.

I'm a star. I'm a star, I'm a big

bright shining star.
