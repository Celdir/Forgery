Final Shooting Script

RAV ZINGESSER

"And God said to Abraham, 'Take your

son, your only son, whom you love,

Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah

and offer him there for a sacrifice

upon a mountain that I will show you..."

RAV ZINGESSER

And why did the Holy One -- blessed

be He -- do this? Why did he ask

Abraham to sacrifice his only son,

whom he loved?

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY

Isaac wasn't his only son. Ishmael

was his son, too.

12-YEAR-OLD AVI

The only son he loved.

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY

Oh, they only kill them when they

love them...?

12-YEAR-OLD STUART

(up front; answering Zingesser)

It was a test of Abraham's faith. Of

his devotion to God.

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY

It's not about Abraham's faith. It's

about God's power. God says, "You

know how powerful I am? I can make

you do anything I want, no matter how

stupid. Even kill your own son.

Because I'm everything, you're nothing."

RAV ZINGESSER

But, Danny, if HaShem is everything,

and we are nothing how are we to

judge His actions?

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY

We have free will and intelligence --

which God allegedly gave us....

AVI

Anyway, God never lets Abraham kill

Isaac. He provides the ram so that --

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY

Personally, I think that's a lie. I

think he did kill him.

RAV ZINGESSER

You think?! Based on what?

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY

There's midrash supporting this. My

father read a book by Shalom Spiegel

that -- Isaac actually died and was

reborn.

RAV ZINGESSER

No one follows that midrash.

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY

I do; I follow it. But okay, say God

provided the ram. So what? Once

Abraham raised the knife, in his

heart it was as if he'd killed him.

He could never forget that. And

neither could Isaac. Look at him:

he's traumatized, he's a putz for the

rest of his life. By the end he can't

tell Jacob from Esau....

RAV ZINGESSER

Watch your language....

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY

(rising impassioned)

I think the whole Jewish people were

permanently scarred by what happened

on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in

terror....

12-YEAR-OLD STUART

Fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY

Fear of God makes you afraid of

everything. All the Jews are good at

is being afraid. And being sacrificed.

12-YEAR-OLD STUART

Don't you believe in God?

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY

I'm the only one here who does

believe. You say he's mysterious, yet

merciful. I see him for the power-

drunk madman He is. And we're

supposed to worship such a Deity?? I

say Never! I say...fight him. I say --

RAV ZINGESSER

Avi -- ask Rabbi Springer to come

remove Danny from the class....

RAV ZINGESSER

And you, if you had come out of Egypt,

you would have been destroyed in the

desert with those who worshipped the

Golden Calf.

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY

Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him

crush me like the conceited bully He is.

(to the ceiling)

Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!

SUEDE-HEAD

Fucking kike.

SUEDE-HEAD

Get up.... Get the fuck up....

CUT TO:

WOMAN'S VOICE

Is this working? I'm trying to reach

Danny Balint...Danny, it's Vicki, we

met at Happy Jack's last month...?

WOMAN'S VOICE

I was hoping maybe we could...get

together again... Give me a call --

718-555-0193.

DANNY (INTO PHONE)

...Is it completely vegetarian?

...What do they make the stock

from?... Not chicken, you're sure?...

And no dairy... No, no cheese I don't

eat cheese... Yeah, all right. And

the tropical fruit shake... How long?...

DANNY

Vodka tonic.

BILLINGS

...So she takes the pants in back --

where they try them on? And I think

fuck it....

CARLETON

Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?

BILLINGS

She's been giving me the eye. She's

hot. So I wait till the owner goes up

front....

VOICE

What are you doing??

DANNY

(indicating swastika)

What do you think you're doing?

BILLINGS

Who the fuck are you?

DANNY

(coming toward them)

Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks,

you can't even make a decent

swastika.... Give me the paint.

(O.L. looks to his friends)

Give it to me.

DANNY

(gruff but avuncular)

It's too squared off. You got to

orient it up and down, diamond-shaped,

like this....

(sprays an excellent swastika)

...The arms go clockwise.

(hands the can back)

You're going to Curtis Zampf; me, too.

Let's go?

CURTIS ZAMPF (O.S.)

...Where I grew up in South Boston

twenty years ago, when a kid walked

down the street, everyone knew who he

was...

CURTIS

...If he ran out in front of a car,

some old Mick'd yell at him, "Jimmy

Dunne, get back on that sidewalk and

stay there...."

CURTIS

...The day he graduated high school,

he'd go see his uncle down at the gas

works, or the priest's brother in the

shipyard, get his apprentice papers,

eight years later he'd be making

$16.50 an hour, have four kids, play

ball on Sundays in Columbus Park, and

when he died, the whole town'd get

drunk and cry over him....

CURTIS

...Today, when that kid walks down

the street it's full of trash and

half the faces are black. The

shipyard's closed, all the jobs at

the gas works are set-asides, and by

the time he drops out of school, he

can barely get a job at Burger King.

So he drinks, smokes crack, and when

he hangs himself on the front porch

at twenty-three, the only people at

his wake are a couple of buddies and

his mother. The boy's father won't

find out he's dead till six months

later.

(beat)

The soul of this country is being

destroyed, and all the government can

offer is free trade, mutual funds and

IPOs.

GUY DANIELSEN

You sound like a leftist.

CURTIS

I used to be one.... No, seriously, I

called myself an anarchist. I stood

up for the oppressed. I opposed state

power.

AN OLD COOT

Don't you still?

CURTIS

I oppose the present state because

it's weak. It has been ever since the

left emasculated it over Vietnam. But

I think the average man is crushed

less by accumulated capital than the

loss of community or real leadership,

the personal emptiness he simply

cannot fill on his own....

(matter-of-fact)

That's why I'm a fascist. It's the

only form of government that

addresses our deepest needs.

DANNY

What do you think the fascism of the

twenty-first century will look like?

CURTIS

More cultural than political.

DANNY

Obviously.

CURTIS

Decentralized, nonviolent,

increasingly mainstream. We'll see

antiabortion, anti-immigration groups

form alliances with the gun lobby,

Christian identity types, tax resisters

and even some libertarians....

OLD COOT

What about race?

CURTIS

This isn't the time for that.

DANNY

I disagree.

(glances at Carla)

I think race is central to everything

we're talking about.

(murmurs of agreement)

Spiritual life comes from race. From

the blood. Without that, we're no

better than the Jews....

CARLA

What's wrong with the Jews?

MRS. MOEBIUS

Carla...

DANNY

Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?

CARLA

Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

DANNY

Too difficult?

CARLA

Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul

Virilio?

DANNY

The point is, the modern world is a

Jewish disease.

CARLA

Disease? What disease?

DANNY

Abstraction. They're obsessed with

abstraction.

VOICE (GUY DANIELSEN)

What would you propose?

DANNY

Killing Jews.

CURTIS

That would be a catastrophic mistake.

DANNY

People hate Jews. Do you agree?

CURTIS

They used to. Today it's not an issue.

DANNY

No, but deep down, beneath the

"tolerance" they learn on television,

nothing's changed. The very word

makes their skin crawl.

(around the room people nod)

It isn't even hate, really. It's more

the way we feel when a rat runs

across the floor. We want to step on

it. Crush it. We don't even know why.

It's a physical reaction. Everyone

feels it.

GUY DANIELSEN

Which ones would you kill?

DANNY

Prominent Jews. Who are either

symbols in themselves or who

represent aspects of the Jewish

character people despise.

GUY DANIELSEN

Such as?

OLD COOT

Barbra Streisand.

DANNY

Too obvious.

VOICES

Kissinger...Dershowitz...Roseanne...

DANNY

Yes. And Larry King...

OLD COOT

Is he Jewish?

DANNY

...Leona Helmsley, Michael Eisner, Bob

Dylan, Phillip Roth, Ruth Bader

Ginsberg, Steven Spielberg, Winona

Ryder, Beverly Sills, Alvin Toffler,

Katherine Graham. All of them. But

not yet. We don't want celebrity

obscuring the issue.

CARLA

Which is what?

DANNY

At first, no one will know why the

victims are being killed.

CURTIS

You wouldn't announce it?

DANNY

I'd say nothing. After two or three,

people will try to find a pattern. A

reason.

CURTIS

But when it comes out, the public

will be outraged. It will look like

Germany all over again.

DANNY

Isn't that what we want? Germany all

over again? Only done right this time...

DANNY

Without speeches or political parties.

A movement without leaders so that no

one can stop it...

CURTIS

Okay, let's break this up for now....

(to Danny)

Could you wait a minute...?

CURTIS

(low)

...I thought we agreed, no anti-

Semitism...it's exactly what we're

trying to put behind us.... Trash the

blacks, fine; but...

MRS. MOEBIUS

Did you see how they reacted to him?

CURTIS

Yes, of course. But that only plays

in this room, with people who aren't

embarrassed to call themselves Nazis.

If you want a modern fascism, you

don't mention Jews.

MRS. MOEBIUS

It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It

always has been.

CURTIS

Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely

lasted a decade.... Do you really

want to go down that road again? In

America of all places, where

obedience and discipline are not

exactly the national virtues...

LINA

He's very bright.

CURTIS

He speaks well. But what do we do

with him?

LINA

Let's find out who he is.

CURTIS

You mean who he really is.

CARLA

You're not in school? What do you do?

DANNY

I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In

Queens. I drive a fork-lift.

CARLA

Where'd you read all that stuff?

DANNY

I just read it....

LINA

Young man...

LINA

Lina Moebius. And you are...?

DANNY

Daniel Balint.

LINA

Balint?

DANNY

It's German.

LINA (IN GERMAN)

What part of Germany are you people from?

DANNY (IN GERMAN)

From the Rhineland originally.

LINA (IN ENGLISH)

Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?...

Or any other law enforcement agency?

DANNY

I was going to ask you the same thing.

LINA

So what are you really after,

Daniel?... Do you just want to kill

Jews, or do you have something larger

in mind?

DANNY

Without blood -- a willingness to

spill it -- there's no real power, no

authority.

LINA

(pleased by this)

Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.

DANNY

We're already marginal. We are saying

what no one else has the guts to say.

Isn't that precisely our appeal?

LINA

So what Jew would you kill first?

DANNY

Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to

France. Managing partner at Damon,

Schwarzchild.

CURTIS

(to Lina, explaining)

An investment banking house.

MRS. MOEBIUS

He's Jewish? Manzetti?

DANNY

Totally. The family emigrated from

Bulgaria when he was eleven.

CURTIS

How would you kill him?

DANNY

I'd have to research it, study his

routines, his security.... But

ideally on a New York street at

midday, using a small-caliber

automatic without a silencer.

CARLA

Why no silencer?

DANNY

You want it to be an event.

LINA

Danny, why don't you come visit us in

the country. We have young men with

lots of energy and no ideas. Maybe

you could give them something to

think about.... Bring your friends,

if you like....

BILLINGS

Bring your friends.... We're not his

friends.

DANNY

Then I won't bring you....

BILLINGS

FUCK YOU.

BLACK VOICE (O.S.)

Hey, bonehead...get your moon ass off

the street.

BILLINGS

Why don't you go back to Rwanda and

give each other AIDS.

O.L.

I can't see....

BILLINGS

What, do you like it here?

DANNY

Read Mein Kampf? Hitler had all his

best ideas in prison.

OFF-SCREEN VOICE

Daniel Balint?

DANNY

I'm not leaving without them.

CARLA

Can I use a credit card?

CARLA

He should go to a hospital.

O.L.

I'm okay.

BILLINGS

You coming?

DANNY

(glances at Carla, stays

in the car)

We'll go to the country sometime, okay?

CARLETON

Fucking Danny, man...

BILLINGS

He's an asshole.

DANNY

"...und die Worte zerfielen mir im

Munde wie modrige Pilze..."

CARLA

"And the words fell apart in my mouth

like moldering mushrooms..."

DANNY

How come so many of the books are in

Spanish?

CARLA

They're my father's. He's from

Argentina. My mother's family went

there during the war. That's where

they met.

DANNY

Are they still together?

CARLA

He's in a mental institution.... He's

been there for ten years, off and on.

Mostly on.

DANNY

Is he a Nazi?

CARLA

I guess. His parents are. He doesn't

care about that.

DANNY

What's he care about?

CARLA

Killing himself.

DANNY

You think people ever commit suicide

out of happiness?

CARLA

That's stupid. Why would they?

CARLA

You're not like the others, are

you?... Your friends.

DANNY

Yes, I am. Basically I am.

CARLA

Hurt me.

CARLA

Ow! That's too hard.

CARLA

Do it again....

CARLA

Get up...you gotta go.

CARLA

No, you have to leave. I've got to

write a paper.

(slaps his stomach hard)

Out!

LINA MOEBIUS (O.S.)

Bring the paper, too.

LINDA

I knocked, you didn't answer.

LINDA

What are you doing here?

DANNY

I just came to get some stuff. I'll

be out in five minutes.

(off her)

He doesn't want me around.

LINDA

He's going to die.

(as Danny looks away)

He won't take his medicine. He eats

dairy. He probably still smokes when

I'm not around.

(off Danny's helpless gesture)

I asked him to come live with us.

Alex offered to share his room,

unsolicited.... But he didn't want to

be any trouble.

DANNY

Then he couldn't be bitter about

living alone.

LINDA

Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?

LINDA

Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you

wear that thing?... You know what it

means? To your people...

DANNY

They're not my people....

LINDA

Tell it to Hitler.

DANNY

Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief

rabbi now?...

LINDA

Is this because of those kids who

used to beat you up?

DANNY

What kids?...

LINDA

The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?

DANNY

Nobody ever beat me up.

(as she sighs, turns to go)

Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons.

Even if you knew them all, there'd be

another fifty you didn't know.

LINDA

Do you know them?

(off him)

I made him some noodles for dinner.

You can heat them up and --

DANNY

I've got to get back to the --

LINDA

You can heat them up and eat with him.

DANNY

It's Friday....

FATHER

(a hoarse rasp)

Do I give a shit?

FATHER

The Torah says not to light a fire on

the Sabbath, because it's work,

correct?

(Danny sighs)

But if alternating current's running

through the wires every second of

every day, and I throw a switch, send

it here instead of there, how is that

lighting a fire?

DANNY

"Do chickens give milk?"

FATHER

Exactly.

FATHER

Who's this?

DANNY

Dennis Leary.

FATHER

Leary?

DANNY

No.

DANNY

(offering consolation)

Howard Stern.

FATHER

Obviously.

DANNY

Adam Sandler.

FATHER

Funny?

DANNY

Not like Mr. Dorfmann.

FATHER

He was funny.

FATHER

After your mother died, that's when

you stopped going to shul. Doing your

homework. Everything.

DANNY

And that's when the Mets started to

stink.

FATHER

'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He

knew how to deal with the assholes.

Dallas Green, please...

DANNY

Valentine...

FATHER

There's some maple walnut in the freezer.

DANNY

Linda says you're not supposed to

have dairy.

FATHER

Just a little... What's the difference?

FATHER

Yeah?... Hold on.... It's for you.

DANNY

Hello...?

VOICE

Daniel Balint? My name's Guy

Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the

New York Times.

DANNY

(impressed, suspicious)

New York Times...?

VOICE

I'm doing a piece on right-wing

groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear

you're an important figure in those

circles. You have a lot of interesting

ideas....

DANNY

Who told you that?

VOICE

Isn't it true?

DANNY

No, it's...yeah, it's true, but...

how'd you get this number?... No, not

here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place

off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...

GUY DANIELSEN

Danny...Guy Danielsen...

DANNY

(sardonic, now he gets it)

You...

GUY

Milk...?

GUY

Is it okay if I record this?

DANNY

No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So

what's this about? Is this about me?

GUY

I'm trying to figure out where the

radical right is going to next....I

thought you were the most interesting

person at that meeting.

DANNY

What about Curtis Zampf?

GUY

Curtis is a politician -- and a bit

of a hustler. He's not a thinker.

DANNY

I agree.

GUY

The other night you said the modern

world is a Jewish disease. Could you

elaborate on that?

DANNY

In the movement -- the racialist

movement -- we believe there's a

hierarchy of the races. Not just in

IQ, but in the civilization, the art,

the forms of government, the

civilizations that each race

produces... Why are you writing this

down if you're recording it?

GUY

It helps me concentrate.... So does

that mean you're a white supremacist?

DANNY

What should I be, a white inferior-

ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian?

Let me ask, where are your people from?

GUY

My mother's family is French, my

father's was German, originally.

DANNY

German. Mine, too. So who do you

think's given more to the world, the

Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe,

Nietzsche -- or the entire continent

of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...

GUY

Danny, what about the Jews?

DANNY

The Jews are different.... Blacks are

disgusting and inferior, but it's

like criticizing a retarded child.

The Jews are...a poison in the human

well....

GUY

A poison...?

DANNY

Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.

GUY

Sexuality??? What do you mean?

DANNY

You ever fuck a Jewish girl?

GUY

What??!?

DANNY

Did you ever fuck one, Guy?

GUY

(laughing, embarrassed)

What's that go to do with...I've gone

out with a, with Jewish women. Why?

DANNY

And? WHat did you notice?

GUY

Notice? Like what...?

DANNY

Jewish girls like to give head, right?

GUY

I don't know. Is that right?

DANNY

And Jewish men like to get it.

GUY

Everybody likes to, don't they?

DANNY

Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the

Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?

GUY

Why?

DANNY

Because the Jew is essentially female.

GUY

Female...

DANNY

Real men -- white, Christian men --

we fuck a woman. We make her come

with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't

like to penetrate and thrust -- he

can't assert himself that directly --

so he resorts to perversions. Oral

sex is technically a perversion, you

know that, don't you?

(as Guy nods)

After a woman has been with a Jewish

man, she never wants a normal partner

again. A normal man.

GUY

Does that mean the Jew is the better

lover?

DANNY

You're not listening. He isn't better.

He gives pleasure, but that's

actually a weakness.

GUY

Danny, what makes you think you know

all this?

DANNY

Let's just say I've done due diligence.

GUY

So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the

Jews own the media and the banks.

It's that they're sexually corrupt.

DANNY

The Jews clearly control the media

and the banks. Investment banks, not

the commercial ones. But the point is

they carry out in those realms the

same principles they display in

sexuality. They undermine traditional

life; they deracinate society.

DANNY

Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A

people -- a real people -- derives

its genius from the land: the sun,

the sea, the soil. This is how they

know themselves. But the Jew doesn't

have soil.

GUY

He has Israel.

DANNY

Those aren't Jews.

GUY

Of course they're Jews.

DANNY

Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally

secular society. They no longer need

Judaism because they have soil. The

real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He

has no roots, no attachments. So he

"universalizes" everything. He can't

hammer a nail, plow a field. He can

only buy and sell, invest capital,

manipulate markets. He takes the life

of a people rooted in soil and turns

it into a cosmopolitan culture based

on books, ideas, numbers. This is his

strength....

(pumped; this is what

he loves)

Take the great Jewish minds: Marx,

Freud, Einstein. What have they given

us: communism, infantile sexuality

and the atom bomb. In a mere three

centuries since these guys emerged

from the ghettos of Europe, they've

taken us from a world built on order

and reason and hurled us into a chaos

of class warfare, irrational urges

and relativity, a world where the

very existence of matter and meaning

is in doubt. Why? Because it is the

deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to

unravel the very fabric of life until

nothing is left but thread, nothing

but nothingness. Nothingness without

end...

GUY

Are all Jews the same?

DANNY

Differences exist, of course, but

they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his

Jewishness dominates everything. Even

the ones who renounce it, who hate it,

who want to cut it out of their

hearts a knife...can't escape.

They're still just Jews.

GUY

Danny, this is great. You're

incredibly articulate. One more

thing... How can you believe this when

you're a Jew yourself?

DANNY

What? Excuse me?...

(Guy says nothing)

You're kidding, right?

GUY

Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman?

He used to be at Congregation Beth

Elohim in Ozone Park...?

DANNY

Who? How would I know him?

GUY

He says you were bar mitzvahed there,

in March 1988.

DANNY

You believe that? And you call

yourself a reporter?

GUY

So you're saying it's not true.

DANNY

Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...

GUY

Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere

else?

DANNY

Do you know who you're fucking with here?

GUY

That's what I'm trying to find out,

Danny. Who am I fucking with here?

DANNY

(sputtering, unsure

what to say)

Listen to me....

GUY

Why would Nadelman lie?

DANNY

To discredit me. Because I know who

they are. Look, I thought I explained

it to you. Those people can say or do

anything. And they will. It's all

narrative to them, it's... Are you

going to print what this guy said?

GUY

Give me a reason not to.

DANNY

It's slander. It's reckless disregard.

I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.

GUY

Does that mean you deny what he says

is true? Yes or no.

DANNY

Look at me. Look at me, Guy.... Oh,

now you can't look at me? Look at me,

you schmuck. Look at me....

(pokes the gun in Guy's face)

You print that shit in the New York

Times...I'll kill myself.

BILLINGS

Do we have to listen to this shit?

DANNY

Yes.

BILLINGS

Why'd we have to leave so fast?

O.L.

Nobody made you go.

CARLETON

Danny's running from the law.

BILLINGS

O.L., how come your mother gives you

a car when you're too fucking blind

to drive?

O.L.

(cackling)

She says 'cause now I can't crack it up.

CARLETON

Hey, O.L., assholes at four o'clock.

O.L.

FUCK YOU, ASSHOLES. SUCK MY DICK!

CARLETON

I thought there were people here....

DANNY

I'll go look....

O.L.

I better stay with the van....

CARLETON

Yeah, you better stay here and guard it.

DANNY

We're from New York. Curtis Zampf

invited us.

WHIT

Who?... Curtis who?

DANNY

Enough?

DANNY

Which was his room?

KYLE

(ferrety, glasses)

Number ten.

DANNY

Yeah, I'm trying to reach Carla, is

she?... Did she get my other

message?... No, I'll call back....

VARIOUS VOICES

Fucking niggers... Fucking niggers?

Fucking gooks!...

WHIT

...Look, if Hitler had knocked out

the RAF in '39, which he could easily,

easily have done, he'd have taken

England, and the U.S. wouldn't have

had --

KYLE

...A staging ground for the invasion,

yeah. But he blew it going after

civilian targets. Just like he blew

the Russian front, diverting supplies

to Auschwitz....

DANNY

Where's Mrs. Moebius?

KYLE

Her place is down the road. But she

just comes out for weekends sometimes.

DANNY

What is this, Stalingrad?

WHIT

Gettysburg. But we're refighting it

with World War I technology. It's a

fucking bloodbath.

KYLE

That was unbelievable what you did to

Lucas. The guy's an animal.

DANNY

You could do it.

KYLE

Get out of here....

DANNY

You look right through him. He's

there, but there's something on the

other side of him that you want. It's

all you want. And whatever's in the

way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.

DANNY

Either of you know anything about

explosives?

VOICE (O.S.)

Take a breath, let out a little,

relax, then squeeze.

Which one were you aiming at?

DANNY

The mother.

DANNY

Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny

Balint...? We met at that...[meeting

at your house.]

CARLA'S VOICE

Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?

DANNY

I didn't realize you cared.

CARLA'S VOICE

I don't. I was just curious how full

of shit you were.

DANNY

Did you know that there was a New

York Times reporter there that night?

CARLA'S VOICE

Really, which one? I bet it was the

guy with the Prada shoes.

DANNY

I didn't notice his shoes.... Did

your mother know he was there?

CARLA'S VOICE

I doubt it. How did you find out?

DANNY

He called me up. He wanted to talk to

me about my ideas.

CARLA

I bet. He didn't realize that nobody

who talks such a good game ever plays

one.

DANNY

You weren't complaining about my play

last time.

CARLA'S VOICE

That's a much easier game.

DANNY

Why don't you come visit, we'll have

a rematch.

CARLA

Too many good players down here. I'm

with one right now.

DANNY

Oh, really?

CARLA

Bigger and better.

DANNY

Then how come you're talking to me?

CARLA'S VOICE

I'm not.

CARLETON

Gas Chamber...

DANNY

(to the whole room)

When are we going to do something?

FIRST WAITER

You know what you want?

BILLINGS

We sure do.

BILLINGS

Ham and cheese on white.

FIRST WAITER

(forbearance)

We don't have ham. We don't have cheese.

BILLINGS

What the hell do you have?

FIRST WAITER

That's what the menus are for.

O.L.

Roast beef and Swiss.

FIRST WAITER

I said: no cheese.

O.L.

What's wrong with cheese?

FIRST WAITER

This is a kosher restaurant. We don't

serve meat with dairy.

DANNY

What about chicken?

FIRST WAITER

That's meat.

DANNY

The Bible only says don't seethe a

kid in its mother's milk. But

chickens don't give milk.

FIRST WAITER

Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.

DANNY

But it's stupid, right? You admit

it's stupid.

FIRST WAITER

No, I don't admit it's stupid.

DANNY

You can have chicken with eggs but

not with milk. Why is that?

FIRST WAITER

I'm not here to talk about religious

law, if you don't like --

DANNY

But you already talked about it: you

said it's not stupid. Why isn't it

stupid?

FIRST WAITER

(calling the other Waiter)

Steve...

DANNY

Steve's going to explain it.

STEVE

We have a problem here?

BILLINGS

We sure fucking do. We don't

understand why you can't eat chicken

with milk. It doesn't make sense.

STEVE

(an intellectual)

Religion isn't about making sense.

It's about --

DANNY

It's about the incomprehensible,

Steve, not the idiotic.

STEVE

Fuck you.

DANNY

That explains it! Now we understand!

JUDGE

...As the altercation appears to have

been instigated equally on both sides,

prison terms strike the court as

excessive.

JUDGE

However, the defendants' political

views suggest that they might profit

from contact with members of our

community whose experiences differ

from their own....

RUMANIAN WOMAN (O.S.)

(Rumanian accent, uninflected)

...When I refused to have sex with

him, the warden had my sister, Esther,

executed in front of the entire block....

RUMANIAN WOMAN

...Everyone considered it my fault.

After that, of course, I did anything

he wanted.

BILLINGS

Why didn't he just rape you?

O.L.

Who'd want to fuck her anyway?

HATE COUNSELOR

I hear one more remark like that, we

go back to the court for resentencing.

RUMANIAN WOMAN

He was a pig, like you, so perhaps he

had no taste.

HATE COUNSELOR

Sit down, please.

(as Billings sits)

Thank you, Mrs. Cohen. Mr Liebowitz,

you indicated you had a story you

wanted to tell....

POLISH MAN (O.S.)

...The man was afraid to let us hide

on his farm any longer, but he agreed

to take us to a more remote place. On

the way he was stopped at a checkpoint,

and when the soldiers found us in the

hay, one of them grabbed my son out

of my arms. He began to cry, so I

reached for him, not to take him back,

simply...

POLISH MAN

...simply to assure him I was there.

But the sergeant became enraged....

He stuck his bayonet in my son's

chest, and lifted him up, impaled on

it. My son was three years old....

POLISH MAN

...He held him up so that the blood

spurting out of him feel on my

face.... The soldiers were laughing.

POLISH MAN (O.S.)

When the blood stopped, the sergeant

pushed my son off the bayonet and

said, "There, you can have him now...."

DANNY

And what did you do?

HATE COUNSELOR

What are you trying to say?

DANNY

What did you do while the sergeant

was killing your son?

BILLINGS

Forget it, Danny, it's all bullshit.

HATE COUNSELOR

Wait a second...

DANNY

(to Billings)

Shut up.

(to man, mid-70s)

What did you do?

RUMANIAN WOMAN

What could he have done?

DANNY

What could he have done?? You fucking

kikes...

HATE COUNSELOR

You can't say that....

DANNY

The Nazi's killing his kid. He

could've jumped the guy. He could've

gouged his eyes out, grabbed the

bayonet and gutted him.... What would

you have done if they were killing

your son?

RUMANIAN WOMAN & OTHERS

...They'd have shot him on the

spot.... He would have been dead in

two seconds.... Who are you judge?

HATE COUNSELOR

(to Danny)

Please sit down.

DANNY

SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO

WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S

A PIECE OF SHIT...

HATE COUNSELOR

Okay, that's it. You're going back to --

DANNY

(over him, to Polish man)

What do you think you should have done?

POLISH MAN

And you, you think you know what you

would have done? You have no idea.

You can't even imagine what that was

like. And you never will....

BILLINGS

Don't listen to them, Danny. It's all

a bunch of crap.

ANCIENT JEW

What is crap?

BILLINGS

The so-called Holocaust. It never

happened. It's the hoax of the

twentieth century.

DANNY

(disgusted with this idiocy)

Oh, please...

BILLINGS

Danny, it's true. There were no six

million. At most, two hundred

thousand Jews died in the camps. And

the majority of them were from

disease and --

DANNY

Where did you read this? Robert

Faurisson?

BILLINGS

(surprised he knew)

Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even

No-am Chomsky says he --

DANNY

Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six

million, why is he your hero?...

Concentration camps all over Europe,

and he only gets rid of a measly two

hundred thousand.... He's a putz.

ANCIENT JEW

Hitler was not a putz. Hitler was

real. God created him to punish the

Jews for abandoning God.

ANCIENT JEW

It is you who are putzes. Little

pishas with your dreams of hatred and

killing...

HATE COUNSELOR

Where do you think you're going?

DANNY

...We have nothing to learn from

these people. They should learn from us.

ANCIENT

And what should we learn from you,

Daniel?

DANNY

Kill your enemy.

DANNY

What is it?

KYLE

Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe

bombs.

(off Danny's reaction, smiles)

A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me.

A donation to the cause.

CARLETON (O.S.)

Hey, Danny.... Guess who's here....

(as Danny quickly slams

the trunk)

Your girlfriend... She's up at the house.

LINA

My L's keep coming out as C's....

CURTIS

(spots Danny)

The prisoner returns....

LINA

Danny, get a drink and come talk to me.

CURTIS

...Insulting people who were in the

camps. ...What's the point?

DANNY

They're liars and cowards.

CURTIS

I'm sure they are. But what do we

accomplish by pointing it out?

DANNY

It's the truth....

LINA MOEBIUS

Danny, what do you think of our troops?

DANNY

(trying to be diplomatic)

They have guts. And they know what

they hate...which is good. But they

have no idea why; they don't think,

they don't read.... They're on beer

and crank half the time....

LINA

The young people in this country...

They're like pigs; all they want is

happiness.... But one needs pigs

sometimes.

(as it RINGS again; to Carla)

Liebchen...

LINA

Do you feel you're making progress here?

DANNY

You mean Ilio Manzetti?

LINA

Forget Manzetti.... Take on something

simple. Something you can actually

accomplish.

(to Curtis)

Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.

CURTIS

An urban type.

CARLA (O.S.)

Danny...telephone.

CURTIS

He's mad, Lina, you know that.

DANNY

Hello?

WOMAN'S VOICE

You know what today is?

DANNY

Linda... How did you get this number?

LINDA'S VOICE

It's Mom's yartzeit.

DANNY

How did you get the fucking number?

LINDA'S VOICE

I want you to say kaddish for her.

It's the only thing she asked from us....

DANNY

I don't do that.

LINDA'S VOICE

You do it on the inside....

DANNY

Don't tell me what I --

LINDA'S VOICE

...I want you to do it on the outside,

too.

DANNY

No!

LINDA'S VOICE

Yes!

CARLA

Who's Linda?

DANNY

(dropping the Times)

Why won't you talk to me?

CARLA

I'm talking to you right now. Who's

Linda?

DANNY

When can I see you?

CARLA

You can't.

LINA (O.S.)

(in German)

Carla, it's time to leave.

CARLA

I have to go visit my father.

DANNY

Your father??

CARLA

He's at a home out here.

DANNY

I'm coming to your room tonight.

CARLA

No.

LINA (O.S.)

Carla!

CARLA

Just after midnight. Five past... But

don't come through the house, they'll

hear you. I'm in the back bedroom,

second floor. Climb onto the kitchen

roof, I'll leave the window open.

LARGE WOMAN

Shabbat shalom.

CONGREGATION (O.S.)

(in rough unison)

Ba-yom, ha-hoo, ba-yom, ha hoo...(etc.)

RABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE (O.S.)

On that day, the Eternal shall be One.

And His Name shall be One....

RABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE

The mourner's kaddish can be found on

page 187....

LARGE WOMAN

Is anything wrong?

DANNY

Shut the fuck up.

RABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE

...Grant us peace, thy most precious

gift, O Thou Eternal source of peace.

We recall with loving memory those

whom Thou hast summoned unto thee.

And we mention by name...Sophie

Budnitz...Bernard Schwabb...Milton

Lifter...Aaron Lustig...Minnie Baum...

DANNY

...Harriet Kantor Balint...

DANNY & OTHERS

Yis-ga-dal v'yis-ka-dash sh'may ra-bo...

RABBI'S VOICE (AMPLIFIED)

May the Lord bless you and keep you....

RABBI (O.S.)

May He cause the light of His

countenance to shine upon you and be

gracious unto you....

DANNY

(to himself)

Eat shit....

RABBI (O.S.)

...May you be blessed in your going

forth as you were in your coming....

DANNY

(shouting to the empty street)

EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....

RABBI (O.S.)

And let us say...

RABBI & CONGREGATION

(with organ; singsong)

Ah -- ah -- ah....men....

LARGE WOMAN

YOU EAT SHIT.

CURTIS

What are you reading?

CURTIS

Leo Strauss...

(nods approvingly)

I've got to go to Boston. I came to

say goodbye.

DANNY

What about Mrs. Moebius and...?

CURTIS

They left an hour ago.

(off Danny's disappointment)

You mind some personal advice? Forget

Carla. That's not the side your

bread's buttered on.

(off Danny's silence)

How soon can you get back to the city?

DANNY

A week or so. There's something I

want to do here first.

CURTIS

What's that?

(off Danny's silence)

Okay. Surprise us...

CHAOS OF VOICES

Ow, shit... You're stepping on my

fucking -- ...Get off me...Goddammit...

(sounds of PUNCHES, a SCUFFLE)

Stop it!... Where's the light?

CARLETON

Jew World...!!

DANNY

(to himself, barely a

whisper)

Shut up. Fuck you....

KYLE (O.S.)

What...?

DANNY

Nothing. Where is it?

(as Kyle hoists a

sports bag)

Okay, let's take one of these panels

off so we can get under the bema...the

stage.

STEROID (O.S.)

Wow, look at this shit....

DANNY

What are they doing?

DANNY

What are you doing? Put that down!

...Put it back in there.

BILLINGS

What do you care?

DANNY

I don't, but...

BILLINGS

(vaults onto the stage)

Let's look at the fucking thing.

DANNY

Put it there, on the...

DANNY

(indicating crowns, the

yod...)

Just be careful with the...

O.L.

(puts a crown on his head)

"If I were king of the forest...not

Prince, not Duke, not Earl..."

KYLE

Open it up.

DANNY

(impulsively taking over)

Here...

VOICES

Oooo... Weird... You read it from

right to left.... The letters look

like squashed bugs.... What kind of

paper is that?

DANNY

It's not paper, it's parchment. It's

made from sheepskin. And all the

letters are drawn by hand.

KYLE

Neat calligraphy.

DANNY

It's called the flame alphabet. It's

supposed to be the word of God

written in fire.

BILLINGS

Fire...

DANNY

The mystics tried to read the white

spaces around the letters. They

thought there was a whole alternative

language hidden there, with secret,

alternative meanings.

KYLE

Cool.

BILLINGS

How come you know all this shit?

DANNY

How come you don't know it?

(pressing the advantage)

How can you say you hate the Jews

when you don't know anything about --

BILLINGS

Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as

much as you do.

DANNY

No, you don't.... If you hated them,

you'd study them, so you'd know why

you hate them. You know what tefillin

is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the

kaddish from the kiddush?

(obviously not)

Eichmann? He went to Israel. He

studied the Torah, the Talmud, the

Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.

CARLETON

Who's Eichmann?

DANNY

Who's Eichmann?!!?

KYLE

He was head of the Gestapo's Jewish

sector. He deported people to the camps.

CARLETON

(reaching toward the parchment)

Can we touch it?

DANNY

Yeah, but not on the letters.

BILLINGS

Why the fuck not?

DANNY

(warning finger)

Just don't.

CARLETON

Didn't you see Raiders of the Lost Ark?

BILLINGS

What??

CARLETON

That was an ark, man. That was a

Torah. They fucked around with it,

and the Torah melted their faces.

BILLINGS

That's a movie, you moron.

CARLETON

Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.

BILLINGS

Let me see.

DANNY

I said not on the --

DANNY

Stop it! What are you doing?

KYLE

Let's get out of here.

DANNY

Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai

echod.

CARLETON

What'd you say?

DANNY

Nothing. Let's go....

CARLETON

Why are you taking that?

DANNY

I'm stealing it.

NEWSCASTER VOICE (V.O.)

...Tragedy was barely averted today

at Temple Ahavat Torah when a bomb

planted under the bema failed to

detonate....

KYLE (O.S.)

Shit!

NEWSCASTER VOICE (V.O.)

...Authorities say that if it had,

injuries and loss of life could have

been in the dozens....

NEWSCASTER VOICE

Channel 8's Cindy Pomerantz spoke to

Rabbi Malcolm Weiss.

CINDY (ON TV)

Rabbi, how is it that disaster and

tragedy were averted here today at

Ahavat Torah?

RABBI (ON TV)

Apparently the power cell in the

timer gave out precisely thirteen

minutes before the device was set to

go off. So we can only conclude that

once again God has intervened to save

the Jewish people....

DANNY

(giving the finger to

the TV)

Oh, fuck you...

RABBI (ON TV)

As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a

mystical number in the Jewish faith.

We believe that God has thirteen

attributes...

RABBI (ON TV)

...Of which the highest is ein sof,

which means "without end," or,

sometimes, "nothingness without end...."

CINDY (ON TV)

Nothingness without end.... That's

very interesting.

RABBI (ON TV)

The purest form of spirit...

DANNY

Okay, everybody out. Get out.

DANNY

Alenu l'shab'ach la'adon hacol...

DANNY

What?

STEROID (O.S.)

Phone, Danny.

GUY'S VOICE (PHONE)

Danny Balint...Guy Danielsen, New

York Times.

DANNY

(tucks in the tallis

fringes)

What do you want? What happened to

your article?

GUY'S VOICE (PHONE)

I couldn't get my editor to run it,

but I bet he will now that you've put

a bomb in a synagogue. That was you,

wasn't it, Danny?

VOICE (DRAKE)

Hey, Danny, want to kill a Jew?

DRAKE

Park up there, we'll walk back.

DRAKE

Lie on your stomach and come up on

your elbows.

DANNY

Why me?

DRAKE

You want to kill a Jew. I already did.

DANNY

Who'd you kill?

DRAKE

Four. But no one this important.

DRAKE

Okay, it's over. He'll take a couple

questions, then come out.... Sight

down the rifle toward the door.

DANNY

How did you know they were Jews?

DRAKE

I can tell....

DANNY

How?

DRAKE

I was a Jew in a previous life.

DRAKE

Here they come.

DRAKE (O.S.)

Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a

Jew in the head.

DANNY

I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --

DRAKE (O.S.)

Just get him in the cross-hairs. With

those shells, anywhere you hit him,

it'll bounce around, rip his insides

all up.

DRAKE (O.S.)

Right there! Just squeeze he trigger.

Slow... Do it!

DRAKE

You missed on purpose.

DANNY

I didn't. I told you, I can't --

DRAKE

What's that?

DRAKE

I knew it.

DANNY

Oh, Jesus...Drake, are you okay...?

DANNY (V.O.)

Kyle, it's me Danny. How you doing?...

I had to come into the city to see

Mrs. MOEBIUS... No, I gave Drake the

van, didn't he bring it back?

DANNY

...Since when?... Really? And he

didn't call?... No, I don't know...

DANNY

Sure, come on down.... Can you bring

my stuff?... Thanks...and if Drake

shows up, let me know right away....

Good...

LINA

How have things been going?

DANNY

(how much do they know?)

Fine.

LINA

(indicates a chair)

We want to talk to you about

something....

(as they sit, Danny nervous)

We're about to launch an aboveground,

intellectually serious fascist movement.

CURTIS

We want to build bridges to certain

positions in the political mainstream:

works like The Bell Curve,

Sociobiology, anti-Zionism, anti-

immigration, the com-munitarian

issue.... We'll hold conferences:

invite liberals, blacks, Jews.

Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch,

Shahack....

DANNY

I've been waiting all my life for

something like this.

MRS. MOEBIUS

We want you to help run it. Give

speeches, lead seminars... Handle the

fund-raising.

DANNY

(slapped in the face)

Fund-raising??

MRS. MOEBIUS

We think you'd be good at it.

DANNY

What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....

CURTIS

That doesn't seem to be happening,

does it?

DANNY

I've been stuck out in the country

with those guys who just want to

paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How

am I supposed to -- (get anything

done there?)

CURTIS

Danny, the night we met, you said the

name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed.

We were excited. But here it is

September, and Mr. Manzetti is still

walking around breathing the air.

MRS. MOEBIUS

We need intellectuals, we have enough

thugs already.

DANNY

I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I

read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...

MRS. MOEBIUS

Look, if you want to kill Jews on

your free time, fine. We need you to

raise money. Will you do that for us?

MRS. MOEBIUS

Thank you.

MRS. MOEBIUS

Do you have a suit?

(off Danny; to Curtis)

Let's get him one.... And a cell

phone too.

(as Danny turns to go;

a joke for her own amusement)

And if you insist on blowing up a

synagogue, make it that big one on

Fifth Avenue, would you?

DANNY

Beth Shalom? It's Reform.

MRS. MOEBIUS

So what?

DANNY

They're not that Jewish.

MRS. MOEBIUS

I don't care what they are. I know

those people, and I don't like them.

The rest are just a bunch of kikes,

aren't they?

VOICE

Here...

CARLA

Where'd you get this?

DANNY

I stole it. From a synagogue.

CARLA

How come there's no punctuation?

DANNY

That was a later invention, it's not

in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews

know where the sentences end. They

know the whole thing by heart. Every

word. Every letter.

CARLA

Do you know it like that? By heart.

DANNY

No.

CARLA

But you can read it, the Hebrew....

Right?

DANNY

What do you care?

CARLA

'Cause I want to know.... What is

this word? This one here...

DANNY

Va-yomer... And he said.

(she moves her finger

to the left)

It goes the other way.

CARLA

(she knew that)

Oh, yeah...

(moves finger right)

DANNY

Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha

mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt

avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...

CARLA

What's it mean?

DANNY

And God said to Avram, take yourself

away from your land and from the

place you were born and from your

father's house into the land -- a

different land -- and I will show you....

CARLA

I want to learn to read it.

DANNY

Why?

CARLA

Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a

basic text of Western culture. I want

to read it in the original. Okay?

DANNY

Hebrew's very difficult. It would

take years.

CARLA

I'm good at languages.

DANNY

Put something on. You're not supposed

to be naked in front of it.

CARLA

Why not?

DANNY

They think it's the word of God, and

it's holy, and the flesh isn't....

CARLA

That's stupid.

DANNY

Yeah, it's stupid.

(indicating her T-shirt)

Put it on, or I won't teach you.

DANNY

See, the Jews love to separate things:

the holy from the profane, milk from

meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath

from the week, the Jew from the

gentile.... As if one little scrap of

this was going to completely

contaminate that.

CARLA

What assholes.

DANNY

You can't curse in front of it either.

CARLA

Who gets contaminated, the Jews or

the gentiles?

DANNY

Good question. Both.

(draws a letter)

Aleph...

CARLA

It looks a little like a swastika.

DANNY

It's silent. It holds a place, takes

a vowel. The vowels are little dots

that go under the letters.

CARLA

Where are they?

DANNY

They don't put them in the Torah.

I'll get you a chumash, they'll have

them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...

(as she repeats the names)

How come you're here instead of with

Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...

CARLA

The sex is better.

DANNY

Even though his dick is so big?

CARLA

With you there's a tragic dimension.

DANNY

Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...

KYLE

This will be a different kind of device.

DANNY

That damn thing. You know how it made

me look...?

KYLE

I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen

again. I'm going to use a brand-new

power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up

timer.

DANNY

I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm

serious. I'm always talking about it.

This time it's gotta happen.

KYLE

It will.

DANNY

What about Drake, did he ever show up?

KYLE

No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows

where he went.

FATHER (IN POLISH)

...Hush, come on, don't cry.

Everything will be all right....

DANNY/NAZI SERGEANT

(in German)

What's the matter here?

FATHER

(to the Sergeant, in German)

Excuse me, I'm sorry, just a moment...

FATHER

(in Polish)

Please, sweetheart, you have to go.

I'll see you soon.

DANNY/NAZI SERGEANT

Fucking kike.

VOICE

Hey, Danny...Danny...

YOUNG MAN

It's Stuart. Stuart Schoenbaum.

DANNY

Shlomo?

STUART

Yeah...

STUART

Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's

wedding.

DANNY

Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's

going on?

STUART

I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...

DANNY

JTS...?

STUART

What about you? What are you doing?

Something strange, I bet.

DANNY

I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.

STUART

(impressed, excited)

Are you an artist?

DANNY

No, no... Not that kind of...

underground. More a private...

business. Private.

STUART

You remember Miriam....

DANNY

Yeah, hey, how're you doing...

MIRIAM

Hey...

STUART

She's at Yale Law -- interning with

the district attorney...

(Miriam makes a face)

We're getting married next spring. In

Israel.

DANNY

Wow, that's uh...great...

STUART

It's great seeing you....

MIRIAM

Maybe Danny'd like to come to the

minyan for the holidays....

STUART

Oh, good idea. We're davening with

this group from the seminary.

Interesting people, very open-minded,

you might like them. And guess who

comes...Avi! You guys could go at it

again like the good old days.

STUART

Danny and Avi used to argue about

everything. Torah, Talmud, politics,

girls. It always ended in a fistfight.

MIRIAM

I remember.

DANNY

I always won.

MIRIAM

The arguments, anyway.

STUART

(hands Danny the address)

It's a K.I. on 101st. In the little

chapel. Try to make it. It'd be fun.

BRAND

You write that?

(as Danny nods)

Come work for me. You've got a lot to

learn; I can teach it to you.

DANNY

I have a job.

BRAND

This? This is a joke.

(tossing down the pages)

I'll give your group a thousand bucks.

DANNY

You gave fifty thousand to that

college magazine.

BRAND

Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that

was a different moment. Things were

possible that aren't now.

DANNY

Actually, I think this moment has

possibilities that --

BRAND

Yeah, I read your piece. It's very

smart. And very wrong.

BRAND

Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't

play anymore.

(over Danny's)

There's only the market, now, and it

doesn't care who you are.

DANNY

People still need values, beliefs....

BRAND

No, they don't. Not the smart ones.

(because he likes him)

Look, I'll give you five grand if you

can document your tax-exempt

status.... But when you fall off this

horse, come see me. I can show you

how to make a lot of money.

DANNY

I don't care about money.

BRAND

You will.

DANNY

You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize

it, but you are.

BRAND

(smiles, uninsulted)

Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now.

What's the difference?

DANNY

How many of you think of yourselves

as anti-Semites?

(All the hands go up.)

Good. Actually, the term is a bit

imprecise since technically Jews are

only one of the Semitic peoples....

In fact, Arabs are Semites, as are

the Eritreans, the Ethiopians, and so

on.... But for our purposes an anti-

Semite is someone who hates or is

against Jews.... Now, why do we hate

them?

DANNY

Let me put it another way. Do we hate

them because they push their way in

where they don't belong? Or because

they're clannish and keep to themselves?

DANNY

...Because they're tight with money,

or because they flash it around?

Because they're Bolsheviks or because

they're capitalists? Because they

have the highest IQs, or because they

have the most active sex lives?

DANNY

Do you want to know the real reason

we hate them?...

DANNY

...Because we hate them.

(as people exchange

puzzled looks)

Because they exist. Because it is an

axiom of civilization that just as

man longs for woman, loves his

children and fears death, he hates

the Jews.

(smiles)

There is no reason. If there were,

some smart-ass kike would give us an

argument, try to prove we were wrong.

And of course that would only make us

hate them more. In fact we have all

the reasons we need in three simple

letters: J-E-W. Jew. Say it a million

times. It is the only word that never

loses its meaning: Jew Jew Jew Jew

Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew....

Abraham murdering his son: first

sending Ishmael into the desert, then

sacrificing Isaac....

VOICES

Shhhh... Can you please be quiet?

DANNY

minor variations.

Ridiculous.

...Look, he's a skinhead.

VOICES

It's just a style, Avi.... There are

antiracist skins.

AVI

Believe me, Danny's the racist kind.

Are you a fascist, Danny? Yes or no.

DANNY

What's a fascist?

AVI

I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi.

He always was.

DANNY

Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.

AVI

The Zionists aren't Nazis.

DANNY

They're racist, they're militaristic,

they act like bullyboys in the

territories....

AVI

They don't have extermination camps.

DANNY

They had Sabra and Shattila.

Do you hate them because they're

wimps or because they're bullyboys?

Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.

AVI

They sound like you.

The Nazis did everything the fuhrer

told them. You do everything the

Torah tells you. Or the rebbe.

Identical slave mentality.

MIRIAM

Why did you come tonight? To see me?

DANNY

(after a beat)

To hear them read Torah.

MIRIAM

I thought you hated Torah.

DANNY

That doesn't mean I don't like

hearing it.

MIRIAM

Point out all the lies and fucked-up

thinking.

MIRIAM

You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked

on a desert island. When they rescue

him, they see he's built two

synagogues. They say, for vhat do you

need two synagogues? He says, vun to

pray in, and vun I'd never set foot

in so long as I live, so help me God.

(he nods, he's heard it)

You pray in the one you'd never set

foot in...and vice versa.

DANNY

I can't help what I think.

MIRIAM

This is me.

MIRIAM

Tell me about Lina Moebius.

DANNY

(startled)

How did you...?

MIRIAM

I work in the DA's office. You go to

those meetings, half the people there

are informants.

DANNY

You mean the Times guy?

MIRIAM

Which Times guy?

DANNY

With the shoes... There was more than

one?

MIRIAM

Danny...Danny...

(he doesn't look back)

Shit...

CARLA

(slowly, laboriously)

Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...

DANNY

(correcting her)

V'asitem...

CARLA

V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And

make no graven image of the Lord, or

the form of any figure, or of man or

woman, or beast or fowl or fish or

anything that looks like anything.

Because He's not like anything. Not

only can't you see Him or hear Him,

you can't even think about Him. I

mean, what's the difference between

that and Him not existing?

DANNY

(still exercising)

No difference.

CARLA

Christianity's silly, but at least

there's something to believe in. Or

not believe. Judaism there's nothing.

DANNY

(to himself)

Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's

not about belief.

CARLA

What's it about?

DANNY

About doing things. You light candles,

say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit

the sick....

CARLA

And belief follows?

DANNY

No. Nothing follows. You don't do it

because it's smart or stupid or it

saves your soul. You're not saved.

Nobody's saved. You do it because the

Torah tells you do. You submit to the

Torah.

CARLA

Fuck that.

DANNY

Don't curse in front of it.

CARLA

(flips the book closed)

Why should I submit?

DANNY

You shouldn't.

CARLA

You think I should just because

there's no reason?

DANNY

No, I think you shouldn't.

CARLA

Judaism doesn't even need God. You

have the Torah, the law. That's your

fucking God....

(anticipating his objections)

The book's closed.

DANNY

You're learning the Hebrew really fast.

CARLA

I told you, I'm good at this.

DANNY

Plus you have nothing else to do all day.

CARLA

Oh, am I learning it faster than you

did? Maybe I'm smarter.

CARLA

Is that funny? You think Jews are the

only smart ones?

DANNY

What...? You think I'm Jewish?

CARLA

It's all you talk about. Jewish,

Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it

that much except the Jews.

DANNY

Nazis talk about it all the time.

CARLA

Do they?

DANNY

The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels,

they talked about Jews incessantly....

You ever read their diaries?...

CARLA

Is that why you became a Nazi? So you

could talk about Jews incessantly?

DANNY

Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't

possibly have hated the Jews as much

as I do. Not in a billion years. You

know why?

CARLA

'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.

DANNY

You want a punch in the mouth?

CARLA

Okay...

(he doesn't hit her)

Why don't we light candles on Friday?

Let's light candles.... And say the

kaddish.

DANNY

Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.

CARLA

I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush.

And shave my head, fuck through a

sheet, all that stuff...

(as he walks away)

Come on, just for fun. To see what

it's like...

MRS. MOEBIUS

Half the right-wing money in New York

is here tonight. They came to see you.

If you impress them, if you do what I

know you can, this movement will be

up and running by tomorrow. And on

the front page of the New York Times

in six months.

DANNY

We tested the new bomb.

MRS. MOEBIUS

What?

DANNY

We redesigned the timing mechanism.

It can't possibly malfunction.

MRS. MOEBIUS

Danny, please. Just give your

speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?

DANNY

Shema yisroel adonai elohenu adonai

echod.

DANNY

Who knows what that is?

VOICE

A Jewish prayer.

DANNY

Can anybody imagine why I would say a

Jewish prayer?

ANOTHER VOICE

Because you're a Jew.

DANNY

That could be one reason. What's

another?

(no response)

Let me put it this way...who here

would like to destroy the Jews?

(murmurs of approval)

Who wants to grind their bones into

the dust?

DANNY

And who wants to see them rise again,

wealthier, more successful, powerful,

cultured and intelligent than ever?

DANNY

Then you know what you have to do?...

You have to love them.

DANNY

Did he say love them? Love the Jews?

It sounds strange, I know, but with

these people nothing is simple. The

Jew says that all he wants is to be

left alone to study his Torah, do a

little business and fornicate with

his over-sexed wife.... But it isn't

true. He wants to be hated. He longs

for our scorn. He clings to it as if

it were the very core and mystery of

his being. If Hitler had not existed,

the Jews would have invented him. For

without such hatred, the so-called

Chosen People would vanish from the

earth....

DANNY

...And this reveals a terrible truth,

the crux of our problem as Nazis: the

worse the Jews are treated, the

stronger they become. Egyptian

slavery made them a nation; the

pogroms hardened them, Auschwitz gave

birth to the State of Israel.

Suffering, it seems, is the very

crucible of their genius. If the Jews

are, as one of their own has said, a

people who will not take yes for an

answer, then let us say yes to them.

If they thrive on opposition, let us

cease to oppose them. The way to

annihilate them, utterly and

completely, is to open our arms, take

them into our homes and embrace them.

Only then will they vanish into

assimilation, dilution...and love.

(a warning finger)

But we cannot pretend. The Jew is

nothing if not clever. He will see

through condescension and hypocrisy.

To destroy him, we will have to love

him sincerely.

GUY

But if the Jews are strengthened by

hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you

speak of -- by love or by any other

means -- in fact make them more

powerful than they are already?

DANNY

(after a beat)

Yes. Infinitely more. They would

become as God.

DANNY

It is the Jews' destiny to the

annihilated so that they can be

deified....

(the murmurs swell)

Jesus understood this perfectly. And

look what was accomplished there with

the death of just one enlightened Jew.

Imagine what would happen if we

killed them all!!

(over the rising outrage)

So, let us say together... Shema

yisroel...

MRS. MOEBIUS

Are you out of your mind?!

DANNY

I was just trying to make a point. If --

CARLA (O.S.)

Oh, my God...

(calling)

Lina...

MRS. MOEBIUS

I'm relieving you of all duties. I

don't want you working for us anymore....

DANNY

You can't. Do you know how many

people I've brought into...the

movement...?

CARLA (O.S.)

Lina, come here!

REPORTER (O.S.)

According to police, he had just left

the restaurant and was walking the

block and a half back to his office,

when the gunman stepped out of this

doorway, fired seven times at point-

blank range...then fled on foot.

DANNY

(a terrible premonition)

Who was it?

REPORTER (O.S.)

...Paramedics arrived within ninety

seconds, but Mr. Manzetti was

declared dead at the scene.

ANCHOR'S VOICE

Ilio Manzetti was one of the

respected and influential men in New

York. As an investment banker,

diplomat, adviser to presidents and

mayors, he helped shape public policy

and private finance for more than

three decades. He'll be missed, Phil.

This is Michael Port with New York 1.

DANNY

(stunned)

Do you think I...

MRS. MOEBIUS

Danny, please, we don't want to know.

ANCHOR'S VOICE

The assailant is described as a white

male in his late 20s....

KYLE'S VOICE (PHONE)

You finally killed a Jew, man. How's

it feel?

DANNY

Kyle...I can't talk right now....

GUY

Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?

DANNY

No.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Not the camera, don't hurt the camera...

GUY

Did you kill him?

GUY

Two days ago you addressed a Nazi

rally. Last week you went to a Torah

study group.

DANNY

What were you, following me?

GUY

How do you reconcile the two?

DANNY

I don't. Look, stay out of what you

don't understand.

GUY

Explain it so I can.

DANNY

You work for the New York Times. Your

whole job in life is not to understand

things like me.

GUY

I don't think you know what you are.

DANNY

(walking on, fast)

Yeah, and what are you? A Times man?

A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?

GUY

Who killed Manzetti?

DANNY

If I tell you, will you pull the

story? Not write about me?

GUY

It's too late.... If I didn't,

somebody else would.

(as Danny just snorts)

Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will

you go to synagogue?

DANNY

(turns on him, threatening)

Get the fuck away from me.

VOICE

Hey, Danny, just one more!

MIRIAM

You're telling me you killed him? You?

Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of

gun did you use?

DANNY

(guessing)

A forty-five.

MIRIAM

It was a nine millimeter.

DANNY

You're lying.

MIRIAM

So are you... But they'll believe

you....

(as they walk)

Lina Moebius is saying the whole

thing was your idea. That you

proposed it in a meeting at her house.

(when he doesn't deny it)

Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you

thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's

dead? Do you really want to kill Jews?

You want to kill me?

DANNY

I was just talking. I -- look, I

can't help what I think.

MIRIAM

All right, what if all along you were

actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to

expose them....

DANNY

But I wasn't.

MIRIAM

And only talked about killing

Manzetti to convince them you were an

anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea

somebody would take it seriously, you

never would have said it.

DANNY

I can't say that.

MIRIAM

Think about your father. Your sister.

DANNY

The truth doesn't mean anything to

you, does it?

MIRIAM

Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.

DANNY

(over her)

Fucking kike.

MIRIAM

Try to get Lina Moebius on tape,

telling you to do something.

Something violent... That's right, I

don't care about truth. I care about

you.

(looks at her watch)

Kol Nidre's at six-thirty. I've got

to meet Stuart. We'll be at the

minyan tonight and tomorrow. If you

need me, come there....

DANNY

What's going on?

CARLA

It's erev Yom Kippur.... We'll have

dinner, then go to shul. Atone for

our sins.

CARLA

Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He

studied Torah. He hated Jews.

DANNY

(in the closet, looking)

Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?

CARLA

I don't know. I just want to try it.

DANNY

Shit...

(looking in other places)

Did you talk to your mother today?

CARLA

No. What are you looking for?

DANNY

Nothing.

(indicates table as he

keeps looking)

Why are you doing this?

(back to the closet)

I thought God didn't exist.

CARLA

He commands it whether He exists or

not...

(off his silence; with

difficulty)

Look, we can fight him and be crushed.

Or we can submit.

DANNY

(from the closet)

And be crushed.

CARLA

Yeah, okay. But what if...what if...

submitting...being crushed, being

nothing, not mattering, what if

that's the best feeling we can have?

CARLA

Look, just light the candles with me.

Then we'll eat. You have to eat.

DANNY

You eat first, then you light.

(exasperated, he has to

explain)

Once you light, it's Yom Kippur,

which means you're fasting, so you

can't...eat.

DANNY

A woman of valor, who can find her?

Her price is above rubies....

DANNY

Miriam, it's me, Danny.... Come on,

the holiday hasn't started, pick up

the --

(as someone does)

...Is Stuart davening Ne'ilah

tomorrow at the minyan... 'Cause he

always does... Tell him I'm doing it

instead....

DANNY

Miriam, I'm davening.... He gives me

any trouble, I'll beat the shit out

of him right there in the room. I'm

serious....

LINA

Why didn't you tell us?

DRAKE

(never considered it)

I was hurt. I just...

BILLINGS

He went to his friends' place and I

laid up there 'til he was better.

Then he called me.

CURTIS

You should've gone to the police.

LINA

I don't think Drake wants to talk to

the police. Do you?

DRAKE

I'll take care of him myself.

CURTIS

Daniel Balint.

LINA

(takes the phone)

Hello...?

DANNY

Lina... It's happening. Tonight.

LINA

What is happening?

DANNY

Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.

LINA

Beth Shalom? What are you talking

about? Who is this...?

DANNY

Lina, you said if I was going to

plant a bomb, I should --

NAZI SOLDIER

(in German, to his fellows)

Kill him!

DANNY

How're we doing?

KYLE

That's all we've got left.

DANNY

It'll be enough if we use it right.

(checks his watch)

Okay, the service'll go about another

hour. Say an hour for the janitors,

then one more just to be safe...

We'll go in at midnight.

KYLE

Didn't you get anything?

DANNY

I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's

drive around.... We don't want to be

spotted here.

LINA

(white with fury)

He is trying to set us up.

LINA

(to Drake and Billings)

I want him dead by tomorrow night.

That lies within your capacities,

correct?

CURTIS

(into phone)

Yes, I believe that a bomb is going

to be planted tonight at Temple

Emanu-el on 65th Street.... By the

same man who killed Ilio Manzetti...

His name is Daniel Balint....

KYLE (V.O.)

Oh, what is this shit?

DANNY (V.O.)

Keep driving. Don't slow down.

KYLE (V.O.)

Christ...

DANNY (V.O.)

Not too fast.

KYLE (V.O.)

You said they didn't have night guards.

DANNY (V.O.)

They don't. I checked twenty times....

Somebody must have talked.

KYLE (V.O.)

Who even knew?

DANNY (V.O.)

Mrs. Moebius.

KYLE (V.O.)

Why? Why would she?

DANNY (V.O.)

The Manzetti thing must have scared

her. She thinks she'll get implicated.

KYLE (V.O.)

So what do we do with the device?

DANNY (V.O.)

Take a right on 59th...

(as the car turns)

We'll put it someplace else.

KYLE (V.O.)

Where?

DANNY

I have an idea....

DANNY (V.O.)

Over here.

KYLE

It's all reinforced in here. It's not

going to blow out the way we want it....

KYLE

If I went back to the lumberyard, the

guy'd give me all the dynamite I

wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't --

need to...

DANNY

No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't

get this many of them in here for

another year. It'll be fine.

KYLE

It's not going to be fine. It's --

DANNY

Just do it.

KYLE

What's that?

DANNY

It's just somebody on the street.

KYLE

When do you want it to go off?

DANNY

Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.

KYLE

So that's what? Nineteen thirty

minutes...what time is it now...

REPORTER

...You're saying that when he first

appeared at your house, you had no

idea he was Jewish....

MRS. MOEBIUS

None whatsoever. But I have to admit,

I'm not terribly surprised.

REPORTER

What do you mean?

MRS. MOEBIUS

I think anti-semitism today is

largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't

you agree?

REPORTER

In the Third Reich, weren't a number

of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?

MRS. MOEBIUS

Yes, and they were said to be the

most virulent proponents of the Final

Solution. Really, who but a Jew would

want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply

because he was Jewish? Who thinks

about such things?

REPORTER

The papers are going to report

tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis

Zampf, has been a federal informant

for the past two years. Do you

believe that?

MRS. MOEBIUS

(enigmatic smile)

Curtis is always more complicated

than he seems. Even now.

You remember what you said, that

THE END
