CITY OF JOY

HASARI

I'll send money soon.

HASARI'S MOTHER

Don't let the children out of your

sight. Not for a moment.

HASARI'S MOTHER

Help your parents. Don't fight

with each other. And, Manooj,

stay away from the cinema, do you

hear?

(CONTINUED)

2.

SHAMBU

I don't want to go. There are bad

men with long knives who steal

children.

HASARI'S FATHER

A man's journey to the end of his

obligations is a very long road.

Yours begins here.

MANOOJ

(to his neighbor)

Our farm has died, so we are

moving to Calcutta to become rich!

DISSOLVE TO:

(CONTINUED)

3.

MAX

Get serious.

BETSY

I swear to God, you never give

anything enough time! What did

you expect in five days, Max?

MAX

Only what    they promise in the

brochure:     Inner peace, serenity,

and a nice    chant that gets rid of

this rock    in my gut. E.S.T., they

do you in    a weekend.

BETSY

I would really appreciate it if

you wouldn't be terribly glib just

now, Max.

BETSY

Am I to assume you'll be at the

airport in Calcutta a week from

tomorrow?

(CONTINUED)

4.

MAX

Impossible to predict, Betsy Ilene

Kahn. Maybe you better give me my

ticket.

BETSY

Screw you, Max -- I paid for it!

How many times am I going to let

you walk out on me and come back?

MAX

I think only you can answer that,

Betsy Ilene Kahn.

MAX

Do you really think that's an

appropriate way to get rid of your

Western rage, Bets?

MAX

One slap is romantic. Two would

call for retaliation... Lend me a

hundred dollars.

DISSOLVE TO:

(CONTINUED)

5.

MAX

How you doin'?

CLERK

Hello.

MAX

I've always wanted to walk into a

little airport just about like

this one and ask the guy at the

counter the following question.

Ready?

MAX

When's the next flight to anywhere?

CLERK

To Bombay. Tomorrow, at one

o'clock in the afternoon.

VEEJAY

I say, are you looking for a way

out of here? We have an extra

seat. Where are you wanting to

go?

MAX

I'm wanting to go wherever you're

wanting to take me.

6.

VEEJAY

We were among the fortunate back

in '48.  We got out of East Bengal

before partition destroyed so many.

We make mattresses. The Rajah

Double Spring.

VEEJAY

We don't have a flight attendant

on this flight...

(passing the flask)

Are you a musician, Mr. Loeb?

MAX

Unattached trumpet player and

recently-certified associate guru.

MANOOJ

Daddy, I'm scared.

(CONTINUED)

7.

HASARI

Scared? No -- why? This is very

exciting. As soon as we get to

our friend's house, everything

will be fine.

HASARI

Wait right here. Don't move.

HASARI

Please, can you direct me to my

friend at this address? We are

to stay with him.

VENDOR #1

There's no such address as this in

Calcutta.

HASARI

But that's not possible.

VENDOR #1

Of course    it is possible! I have

lived here    all my life. You are

new. Who     would know if a place

exists or    does not?

VENDOR #2

Bombay, perhaps. Delhi.     Look

there.

(CONTINUED)

8.

RACK FOCUS TO:

HASARI

Manooj, go and get some fruit.

Come straight back.

GANGOOLY (TALL MAN)

Yes, hello, brother. Bihar, am I

correct?

HASARI

Yes, how did you know?

(CONTINUED)

9.

GANGOOLY

Let me say only that the terrible

malevolence that has visited your

part of the country affects us all.

HASARI

Three years without rain. Nothing

came out of the earth but debts.

GANGOOLY

Terrible. And now, the    family on

the street. It is not    acceptable.

(smile widens)

And if I can't help, my   name is not

Mr. Gangooly... Which,   blessedly,

it is.

GANGOOLY

Be free -- look around.

GANGOOLY

They'll need feeding. Give them

seed. But don't spoil them.

(CONTINUED)

10.

GANGOOLY

And now, one of the miracles of

life in the city. One and two...

GANGOOLY

Holy water from the Ganges! Flows

out forever. Come -- touch it.

GANGOOLY

Drink! It's as pure as the dew on

Shiva's lips.

GANGOOLY

Now, this place is yours for two

weeks. My cousin, Moti, is away,

traveling. Normally, the rent

takes fifty rupees for a week, but

for a brother, forty. No, don't

thank me.

HASARI

I have only seventy-five, but as

soon as I have work...

GANGOOLY

Give me the fifty, pay the rest

next week. You'll find work, I

trust you. Aren't I from Bihar,

too?  Yes.

GANGOOLY

You are pleased? Then Mr. Gangooly

is pleased. It's how I am.

(CONTINUED)

11.

RAVI

I hope this is all right. The

room hasn't been aired or the bed

turned, but --

VEEJAY

Oh, he doesn't care about that, do

you, Max? Here, look here.

VEEJAY

Help yourself. Be comfortable.

Ravi, come on, go, go, let's leave

the young man to himself.

(CONTINUED)

12.

MAN

What are you doing here?   Who are

you?

HASARI

My name is Pal, Hasari. Mr.

Gangooly rented this space to --

MAN

Mr. Who?

HASARI

Gangooly.   You must be his cousin,

Mr. Moti.

MAN

I don't know any Gangooly and my

name is Binal and this is my home

-- get out!

HASARI

But this is true. We paid him a

deposit of fifty --

BINAL

A man goes out because he has to

work, and some beggar tries to

move in while his back is turned.

(CONTINUED)

13.

BINAL

So, should I suffer if they are

so stupid to jump into the first

mouth that wants to eat them?

BINAL

You're lucky I don't kill you!

WOMAN

Go to the river. Try to squeeze

in there.

14.

MAX

I'm starving.

RAVI

Well, you don't want to eat those

awful cigars. Come with me, we'll

wake up the cook, she'll fix you

something proper.

HASARI

Don't let it frighten you. You

have to be brave. I know we'll

find work today.

15.

RAVI

It's not extravagant at all. You

can't go around all week in your

tribal garb.

RAVI

Now he looks civilized, doesn't

he, Manubai?

MANUBAI

Almost.

16.

MAX

You sure I look all right?

SHAMBU

Look! A man gave me these many

moneys!

HASARI

What man? Why -- did you ask him

for money?

SHAMBU

He just gave it to me.

HASARI

Where is he?

HASARI

Don't do that. We're not beggars.

HASARI

Go back to the river. Wait for me

by the tree. Don't go anywhere.

Do you understand?

17.

CLERK

Do you have family?

HASARI

Yes, yes of course. But I'm

three days without work. I'll

take anything.

CLERK

Here, now go away.

HASARI

No, I don't want you to give me --

CLERK

In this city, a man with a family

can't be proud. Take it!

MAX

I said you have three days to

get me into bed, and I'm betting

you can't do it.

(CONTINUED)

18.

MANUBAI

It's all right for you to use my

mother as your tour guide and

meal ticket, because she'll get

something nice out of it. But

what would I get?

MAX

Well, gee,    I don't know. Maybe I

could say    something so amusing

that you'd    laugh so hard it would

break that    hot poker you have up

your ass.

VEEJAY

Believe me, I understand, but you

know how women are. Do you have

enough money?

19.

PORTER

It pleases you?

MAX

No fruit basket? No mini bar?

PORTER

Bar? Of course -- many, many.

But make care, Sahib. Please,

for me. If it is lady you like

to know -- yes? -- you let me.

Huh? Very sweet girl, good

nature, very sweet. Or boy, very

good...

PORTER

No like boy? Something then for

smoke -- mmmh, very good for smoke!

PORTER

Maybe you like two girls -- look

a little Chinese, but very great

pleasure.

(CONTINUED)

20.

HASARI

My wife, my children...

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

21.

CHILD (O.S.)

Daaaaaaddddddyyyyy!

CHILD (O.S.)

Daaaaaadddddddyyyy!

SHAMBU

Daaaaadddddyyyy!

HASARI

I told you to remain where I left

you! I told you to stay there!

MANOOJ

The police came!

SHAMBU

We said we had to meet you, but

they didn't care! They were

mean!

ALOKA

These friends have found space.

They will share with us.

HASARI

I would be proud if you would

share our food with us.

22.

ALOKA

I remember the first time I saw

you, on the day of our marriage.

Wearing a bright yellow turban.

You asked me my name and you said,

'You are a very beautiful girl

and I am wondering whether you

will find me appealing.'

HASARI

What?

HASARI

It's all right -- what?

ALOKA

I miss the village.    There I

could help.

23.

BABU

The municipality has directed us

to carry out the destruction of

this settlement. All of you must

go -- now!

ARUN

For what reason?

BABU

Because this settlement is

impeding construction work.

ARUN

We're not moving! Why should

we move? Who is the municipality?

We are! This is our home!

BABU

I have my orders.

ARUN

If we're driven from here, where

should we go?

BABU

I'll give you five minutes to

gather your things. Then, the

settlement comes down.

(CONTINUED)

24.

ARUN

Why should you alone be burdened

with such a task? Let me help!

SHAMBU

Daddy, are we going to die here?

HASARI

No! Today, I'm just a mangy dog

on the street, but soon, I swear,

I'll look other men in the eye!

(a beat)

I swear.

(CONTINUED)

25.

RAFIK (BOY)

Why live like a beggar when you

can live like a maharajah?

HASARI

I thought you were only taking a

little.

ATTENDANT

We pay more, we take more.

HASARI

I'm feeling a little dizzy.

ATTENDANT

It'll pass.

(CONTINUED)

26.

RAFIK

Blood is the oil well of the poor,

brother. Now, give me another

three and I'll give you these.

HASARI

What are those?

RAFIK

Vitamins. Take these and you can

give again in a week.

RAFIK

One week.   Here. The same time.

MAX

They're in the shotgun. There's

the snap from center, the clock is

running -- five, four, three -- he

has an open man at the Notre Dame

twenty for the victory... and he

freezes. He freezes! Mr. Choke

chokes. The fans go --

27.

MAX

Got an I.D. on you?

(she doesn't get it)

How old are you?

POOMINA

Twenty, sahib.

MAX

I buy that.

POOMINA

I can do anything you want, sahib.

MAX

Hold it, time out. Time, there's

time out on the field.

POOMINA

Is problems, sahib?

MAX

Is problems, yeah, just a couple.

POOMINA

No, please, yes, I can --

MAX

How 'bout some chow?

(she doesn't get it)

I was just about to order some room

service. Food. I call, they come,

we eat.

(CONTINUED)

28.

POOMINA

Now, you are ready for great

pleasure, yes?

MAX

Watching you eat was my great

pleasure. Now you go home.

MAX

For you.

MAX

You're a very wet kisser. Work on

it, get in touch in five years.

MAX

Goddamn it, cut it out!   Now, good

night.

MAX

Five years already? Gee, time

really flies when you have no

moral conviction.

(CONTINUED)

29.

MAX

Short guys!   Quit lookin' at us!

POOMINA

Special drink for you, sahib.

Only the most man can drink it.

You make try. For me.

MAX

For you, I would drink battery

acid.

POOMINA

Who that finish first.   I bet!

POOMINA

I beat!

MAX

I really don't think so -- oh no,

nay, nay! I never lose the truly

irrelevant contest.

POOMINA

We have fun some more.   I bet

again!

(CONTINUED)

30.

MAX

Well well. Seek punishment and ye

shall find.

ARUN

Don't go -- what are you doing?

HASARI

It sounds like someone needs help.

HASARI

What are you doing?

(calling back)

A man's being beaten here!

31.

JOAN

Good morning, junior, welcome to

our country.

MAX

Oh, I like the way the room moves

in circles.

(checking out his

accommodations)

I suppose I should inquire where I

am.

JOAN

You're in the City of Joy.

MAX

Is that geographic or spiritual?

JOAN

Oh, now we require that each

visitor decide that for himself.

This gentleman and a young lady

brought you here.

MAX

Did I do that to your nose?

(as Hasari nods)

I'm sorry.

(CONTINUED)

32.

MAX

What was that -- a Shetland pony?

JOAN

I would have to inspect it more

closely, but I believe that was

one of our economy-size rats.

JOAN

Watch your --

MAX

Thanks -- got it.

MAX

Pardon the expression, but Jesus

H. Christ.

(CONTINUED)

33.

MAX

You a doctor?

JOAN

Oh no, I'm a corporate executive.

Doctor arrives at half seven, but

only three days a week.

MAX

This is obviously one of those

three days.

JOAN

Indeed. What brings you to our

country?

MAX

I came to find my white light.

JOAN

Ah, yes.   I take it you didn't

find it.

MAX

Kept opening the doors and windows

of my spirit, but couldn't see a

goddamn thing.

JOAN

What do you do in America?

JOAN

Oh, how exciting. Must be

something illegal. Are you a

criminal of some sort?

MAX

I suppose that depends how you

define the word: I'm a doctor.

JOAN

I see. How long are you here?

Perhaps I could recruit you for --

MAX

Forget it. You've got your non-

practicing Catholics. I'm a non-

practicing doctor.

(CONTINUED)

34.

JOAN

How very distressing.     Why's that?

MAX

Found out I just really don't like

sick people. Well, I'm outta

here. I owe you one.

JOAN

I can't imagine ever divining how

to collect, but there are a few of

us Indians, you know, who believe

the tourist trade ought to be

encouraged.

MAX

Thank you very much.     Let me...

HASARI

No, please.

JOAN

I'm afraid they cleaned you out.

Ram, here's your first rider.

(to Max)

Take this.

JOAN

Go on, it's all right.     You'll owe

me two.

HASARI

You see, I can keep up.

(CONTINUED)

35.

RAM

Keep up, of course. Anyone can

run at this pace. But you think

it's easy to run and to pull?

HASARI

I can do it.   I could pull it.

MAX

Come on, give him a shot. He's as

fast as you and looks twice as

strong.

RAM

Will you still pay me when he runs

you into a ditch?

MAX

Absolutely.    I trust the man.

RAM

All right, you, come, step in here.

MAX

I hope you're taking something for

that.

RAM

Now, fine, pull, go.

RAM

See, mister! What did I tell

you? Come on! What do you think

this is -- some village street?

You've got to move quickly.

RAM

You see, it takes a gift.

(CONTINUED)

36.

MAX

I say he can do it. I'll bet you

the fare he can do it.

(play by play)

What do you think, rickshaw fans,

can he do it?

ASHOKA

Not a tongue between you then?

(CONTINUED)

37.

RAM

Yes, yes, I am wondering, sir,

we are, is it possible you might

have something for my friend?

RAM

Let me explain it for your ears,

sir. My cousin from Bihar has

just arrived in our city --

GOONDA

They've brought a small present

-- of respect.

ASHOKA

So, you want to be a human horse?

RAM

Oh yes! I have personally witnessed

his excellence -- yes.

ASHOKA

He doesn't talk? Can he neigh at

least?

(to Hasari)

You -- do your ears function?

HASARI

Oh yes, Babu.    Can I... uhm...?

ASHOKA

Neigh!   Like a horse.

HASARI

Well, yes, Babu, I can do that.

Would you like me to imitate a

horse?

38.

GHATAK

Lift your longhi.

GHATAK

The wise men of our nation say that

nirvana is the attainment of a

state of supreme detachment. For

me, nirvana is counting each

evening, one by one, the rupees

earned by my two thousand and

forty-six rickshaws.

GHATAK

You are with family?

HASARI

I have a wife and three children,

Babu.

GHATAK

And they must eat, heh. The

world is full of open mouths.

HASARI

I shall be eternally grateful to

you. From now on, I shall be as

the youngest of your brothers.

GHATAK

Stay loyal. These days, it's a

crop nobody plants.

(CONTINUED)

39.

HASARI

Someone has blessed us. A job, a

roof, a school. Soon I'll be able

to send money home...

(looking at Amrita)

... and put away a little bit for

your dowry.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO BLACK.

40.

DISSOLVE TO:

SCHOOL GIRL

Rickshaw wallah!

(CONTINUED)

41.

RAM

Let Hasari go!

HASARI

I'm sorry, I don't know where that

is. You're my very first passenger.

SCHOOL GIRL

Really.   Well, I hope I bring you

luck.

SCHOOL GIRL

That way, and then to the right.

RAM

(calling)

Feed the police!

SCHOOL GIRL

This is my home address. Pick me

up promptly at seven each morning.

HASARI

Yes, thank you, you can depend on

me.

42.

MAX

Beef. You know -- cow? Minced,

little salt, pepper, slap it flat

like this, throw it on the grill,

flip it.

MAX

Put it on the grill, I'll be right

back.

MAX

You know, I have to say you

really don't look Jewish. I

believe that's mine.

ASHOKA

Don't touch me. No one touches me.

MAX

Really?

43.

MAX

Oh... great... good...good timing

...him!

COP

May I see your passport?

MAX

Passport? I'm in the middle of a

high speed chase. That guy --

COP

Passport please.

MAX

It's in my hotel room.

COP

Passport, please, now.

MAX

Ready my lips: I do not have my

passport with me at this...

(he gets it)

Ah, I see, said the blind man.

44.

JOAN

Well, all right, junior, so you'll

owe me three.

JOAN

Oh, it was just a whim in the

beginning really -- to try to

convince them not to be so bloody

passive, that they could pull

themselves up on their own. I

get a little money from a Swiss

organization. Now it's become a

bit more than I can manage.

MAX

It's got to be like trying to

drill a hole in water, though.

JOAN

We just need a few more hands on

this little life raft we've set

afloat here.

(CONTINUED)

45.

JOAN

You know what I've come to think

in my middle age, Max?

MAX

Nope, no, earthly idea. You're

pretty much outta my league,

thought-wise.

JOAN

There are really only three

actions open to a person.

MAX

Only three -- okay.   And what are

they?

JOAN

To run, to spectate, to commit.

MAX

Has it occurred to you that this

obsession with charity is really a

flaw in your character?

JOAN

Charity! It's not charity, dear

child, it's love. You're very

badly twisted around, aren't you?

MAX

One of us sure as hell is.

SUNIL

I'm off for home, Sister Joan. A

pleasure to meet you, Dr. Loeb.

MAX

The same.

SUNIL

See you day after tomorrow.

JOAN

Good night, God bless, Doctor.

(a beat)

Generous young man.

(CONTINUED)

46.

CONTINUED:

As he watches Sunil head away, Max senses something com-

ing at him from the side. A soccer ball almost hits him;

he jumps up, handles the ball athletically.

SQUARE

He begins to play with Manooj and several other children.

Shambu leaves his post in the tea shop to join them.

MANOOJ

Are you the American doctor?    Are

you coming here to help us.

MAX

No, I'm the visiting American

soccer star, El Max.

MANOOJ

Do you go to the cinema in

America, El Max?

MAX

When I was your age -- two movies,

plus cartoons every Saturday.

Aloka and Amrita are cooking on an open fire bucket. Max

almost knocks the fire over. Aloka looks at him, apolo-

getic, shy... as Manooj knocks Shambu down at Max's feet.

Max scoops the little boy up...

MAX

There you go, little guy.    Ut --

what's this?

Reaching behind Shambu's ear, Max produces a boiled sweet.

Aloka watches this with a smile; their eyes touch again...

as Manooj lets out a cry at the sight of their father.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ram and Hasari return home. Hasari can hardly walk.

Shambu runs to his father, explaining excitedly...

SHAMBU

Daddy, there is the doctor from

America. He saw two movies every

Saturday. What's in your fist?

Open, Daddy!

(CONTINUED)

47.

SHAMBU

Seeds?   Why?

HASARI

So we can watch something grow.

RAM

Another few months, I'll be able

to pay off the moneylender in my

village and go home and open a

grocery shop. All around me sacks

overflowing with all kinds of dal

and rice, aromatic spices, piles

of vegetables... and at night, I'll

lie on my back beneath the trees

sniffing fresh aubergines.

RAM

If my wife will let me come within

a hundred miles of the place where

she herself resides.

HASARI

Amrita, I saw a beautiful wedding

sari today.

RAM

It was six hundred rupees only.

MAX

That's only 40 dollars, isn't it?

HASARI

If you have it.

(CONTINUED)

48.

MAX

I'll send it to you from America

when I get home tomorrow.

HASARI

That's very generous but no,

thank you.

MAX

Repayment for punching you in the

nose.

HASARI

You have repaid me by sharing our

supper.

RAM

Doctor Big Brother, I myself would

be willing to accept a gift. Could

you give me five rupees in a note --

ten, perhaps. My ankle is badly

swelled; the higher the number the

more the swelling sinks.

MAX

I don't have a cent on me.   I'll

owe you.

RAM

How much?

POOMINA

Joan Di, my sister!

(CONTINUED)

49.

JOAN

It was Poomina who brought you to

us. She has herself and her

sister to support. It's all right,

Poomina. Anouar, what is it?

ANOUAR

It's Meeta! It's her time. But

something is wrong. The midwives

don't know what to do! Dr. Sunil,

could he help, perhaps?

JOAN

Dr. Sunil isn't here.

POOMINA

Meeta will die.

JOAN

Max, I wouldn't ask, but it's an

emergency. A pregnancy gone awry.

It's a leper. Could you have a

look?

MAX

I don't have any experience with

leprosy.

JOAN

Good Christ, son, because she's

a leper doesn't mean she's not

built like a woman!

HASARI

I can run and get Dr. Sunil.

JOAN

It's too far.

(CONTINUED)

50.

ALOKA

I could help.    I've had three

babies.

RAM

You can't do that. They're

outcasts, they're unclean.

JOAN

Oh nonsense!    It's not contagious!

HASARI

You're a doctor, how can you not

help?

(CONTINUED)

51.

ALOKA

Will she die?

MAX

(to Joan)

Pull me two c.c.'s of Coramine.

MAX

Uh-oh, uh-oh, who's this coming'

down the lane? Why it's -- is it

possible -- way over here, in

India -- yes, it's Mr. Choke.

MAX

I'm going to have to turn it --

the baby. Tell her she has to

relax these muscles as much as

she can.

52.

MAX

Tell her again to breathe in short

little bursts now.

MAX

All right!   Now, tell her to push.

MAX

Again.   Yes!   Again.   It's coming.

MAX

I've got the head. Come on,

little baby, come on, little

baby. Be alive, be alive, be

alive.

MAX

We've got it, we've got it.     Yeah!

(CONTINUED)

53.

JOAN

For a non-practicing doctor, that

was pretty practiced.

MAX

Never been so scared in my life.

JOAN

Max, please, won't you change your

mind? We desperately need another

doctor. Full-time. Think about

it -- just give us a couple of

months.

MAX

Can't do it. Maybe you've got it

in you to be a saint. I just

don't.

JOAN

Then what do you want? What are

you going to be when you grow up?

Good night, Aloka, Hasari.

ALOKA

Thank you for allowing me to go

with you.

MAX

You could make a helluva nurse.

(CONTINUED)

54.

HASARI

I think perhaps you are a good

man.

JOAN (O.S.)

Jesus, my brother, you who I am

trying to believe are the light

and salvation of the puking world

...

JOAN (O.S.)

Please see that we are living in

madness and darkness here...

JOAN (O.S.)

... and we need help. Om, Jesus,

BETSY (V.O.)

Yes, yes, yes, that's right, yes!

I turned in your ticket!

55.

BETSY

I bought it, I got a refund!

MAX

But I want to go home with you.

BETSY

You want to go home with me?

MAX

Yes.

BETSY

Then prove it.

MAX

Good -- how -- name it.

BETSY

Buy yourself a ticket.

MAX

I would love to do    that, Betsy

Ilene, boy would I    love to do

just that, but I'm    financially

embarrassed at the    --

BETSY

Use your credit cards.

MAX

What credit cards? You know I

maxed them before we left. Just

lend me --

BETSY

No! You won't pay me back; you

never have. Oh, Max!

MAX

They're calling our flight. I

want to go home with you, Betsy

Ilene Kahn. Because I have a

vision. It's...

(CONTINUED)

56.

MAX

I see you and me, Betsy Ilene

Kahn, nibbling toward each other

through a quarter pounder with

cheese, chugalugging a frosty

light beer -- great taste! Less

filling! Bowling! I want to go

bowling, Besty Ilene Kahn!

MAX

I want... Oh, my Lord Amighty, I

want so many American things --

BETSY

Oh, stop it! You have no earthly

idea what you want, Max! And

stop calling me Betsy Ilene Kahn.

MAX

Isn't that your name?

BETSY

You call me Betsy Ilene Kahn like

you just met me yesterday.

MAX

What should I call you?   My girl,

my significant other --

BETSY

Don't get cute! You get cute and

I swear to God --- you told me once

I look like my mother!

MAX

You do -- so what?

BETSY

See -- you don't understand!

MAX

How could I possibly not

understand a conversation as easy

as this one, Betsy Ilene.

BETSY

I hate you!

MAX

Na ya don't.

(CONTINUED)

57.

BETSY

I stood by you for three years!

MAX

I know.

BETSY

I supported you through your

internship!

MAX

You did.

BETSY

Why? It was never working. What

have I been thinking all these

years -- that you'd change?

You're the most self-pitying,

self-destructive, self...

BETSY

But you've taught me something,

Max. You never finish anything.

Well, I quit. I've found my

light and I'm free of you.

MAX

Will you at least call my mother

and ask her to empty my savings

account and wire --

BETSY

Do it yourself, Max. Call her

collect. You should have called

her weeks ago anyway just because

she's your mother!

(to herself)

White light, white light...!

(CONTINUED)

58.

MAX

Guerilla theater, folks. 'All the

world's a stage.'  Don't know if

that word reached you here yet.

If you'd care to show your

appreciation by a small donation...

MAX

Aw, what the hell.

ANOUAR

Good morning, Joan Di. Dr. Loeb

said many of us could be helped;

that all it would take is money

for medication.

ANOUAR

Please buy the medication for us.

If we cannot come here to receive

it, perhaps Dr. Loeb would come

to us.

JOAN

I'll be happy to buy the medication,

but Dr. Loeb is not part of this

endeavor, Anouar; there is only his

cherished memory.

ANOUAR

Then perhaps I am having visions.

59.

MAX

Good morning! Good morning!

Heckuva morning! Getting ready

to practice medicine without a

license, Sister Joan? You don't

see me soliciting conversions,

do you?

JOAN

Well, well, well, I do so love to

be surprised.

MAX

Okay, for starters, pick me out

someone with something easy I can

heal, make me look good.

(to Aloka)

Aloka, you're my assistant, let's

go.

JOAN

Max, knock it off, give us a bit

of hush.

(as he does)

What happened?

MAX

I changed my mind.

JOAN

And I'm a bloody bathing beauty.

MAX

Okay, so I got left.

JOAN

Smart girl... So how long am I

stuck with you?

MAX

Two weeks -- or until Mom sends me

a ticket.

(CONTINUED)

60.

JOAN

Not worth the aggravation of your

prattle every day. Six months --

and not a day less.

MAX

No way. Six weeks -- and that's

my best offer.

JOAN

Two months -- and that's my final

offer.

MAX

(a beat)

Done.

JOAN

Jesus and Mary. The Lone Ranger

rides again.

JOAN

Watch your --

MAX

Thanks -- got it.

FADE OUT.

SCHOOL GIRL

Hasari, where have you been? I've

been waiting almost five minutes.

(CONTINUED)

61.

HASARI

I'm sorry, forgive me.   It won't

happen again.

SCHOOL GIRL

We're not going to school today.

You're taking my mother and me to

the Bara Bazar. I'm getting

married!

HASARI

Oh, I am so pleased for you!

MOTHER

Good morning, Hasari.

HASARI

Good morning, missus.

MOTHER

Turn right at that corner, Hasari.

HASARI

It's farther that way, missus.

MOTHER

No, not really. Turn there,

please.

SCHOOL GIRL

You must remember this shop,

Hasari, when it's your daughter's

time. This is the nicest in the

city.

(CONTINUED)

62.

MOTHER (O.S.)

Don't say things like that. He's

never going to be able to buy

anything here.

ASHOKA

Not working? How will my father

eat this evening?

HASARI

I was just...

ASHOKA

You have a daughter?

HASARI

Yes, Babu.

MARWARI (O.S.)

Rickshaw wallah!

ASHOKA

Keep working. Give this to Sister

Joan and your friend the doctor

when you go home.

(CONTINUED)

63.

MAX

He's just malnourished. Is she

giving him the milk we gave her or

selling it?

ALOKA

Not all.     Most.

MAX

Tell her to give all the milk to

the baby.

MAX

Psst.

MAX

It's okay.

SUNIL

Good night, I'll see you day after

tomorrow.

MAX

Good night, Sunil.

(CONTINUED)

64.

SELIMA

Very special supper for you

tonight, Doctor Big Brother!   Will

you stay?

MAX

Wish I could, Selima,  because I'm

sure hungry! Sixteen   hours of

pestilence and misery  always make

me famished. I have   to go with my

man Anouar tonight.   I've got

lepers to heal!

ANOUAR

No, no, you know how patient we

are. Eat, eat.

MAX

(to Aloka)

You're not tired, are you?

ALOKA

Not if you're not.

JOAN

Well, I think we've got three very

good potential scholars here.

JOAN

Given him some time here, he'll

be good enough for a proper school.

HASARI

It's more than a father could hope.

(CONTINUED)

65.

MAX

Fifteen years from now: Miami,

Florida, Dr. Manooj Pal, in

association with Dr. Maxwell Loeb.

HASARI

(giving her the note)

From the godfather's son. For you

and the doctor.

GHATAK

Acha!

ASHOKA (O.S.)

You!

GHATAK

I understand that you're interested

in expanding your clinic and free

school, and that you intend to

start treating lepers in the City

of Joy.

JOAN

We'd like to better serve the

entire community, Mr. Ghatak.

(CONTINUED)

66.

GHATAK

Of course. That's very good.

Admirable. And we'd be pleased to

rent you suitable space. But you

must understand that certain

payments will go up.

JOAN

I understand the rent would have

to go up if we rent larger

quarters from you, Mr. Ghatak, but

why should we have to pay more

protection?

GHATAK

More people, more potential

trouble. Strangers. If I don't

charge you, what will I tell

others?

JOAN

But we can't afford it!

GHATAK

Surely if you can expand, you can

pay more.

MAX

Am I stupid, but isn't this

protection money money we're

paying you to protect us from you?

GHATAK

We live in chaotic times, Miss

Bethel, Doctor. I control the

City of Joy and maintain it as a

model of harmony. It's a miracle,

but a very fragile miracle.

MAX

And how are we threatening your

miracle?

GHATAK

I admire your courage in choosing

to work in such a violent place,

Miss Bethel.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

67.

GHATAK (CONT'D)

Your neighbors in the City of Joy,

they're not educated, they're

given to violence, to meanness, I

can promise you they won't like

having lepers among them, but

because they know you're under my

protection...

GHATAK

Doctor, do you like our music?

MAX

Well, I can't say I've developed a

craving for it yet.

GHATAK

It's difficult to appreciate what

we don't understand, isn't it?

Let me put it another way: The

world is a terrible place. Only

the ruthless prevail. My son will

make the arrangements with you.

MAX

(to Ashoka)

I like your taste in neckwear.

ASHOKA

The entire package we're proposing

will cost you three thousand rupees

a month.

JOAN

If we pay you that, we won't have

any money for supplies.

(CONTINUED)

68.

ASHOKA

I'm told you're very resourceful.

MAX

I think I see a solution. May I?

What if we were to work out a

profit-sharing arrangement? We

give you a share of our net profit.

ASHOKA

How do you expect to make a profit

off of lepers and the poor, Doctor?

MAX

Beats the hell outta me, asshole.

But you've obviously found a way.

JOAN

Have you gone right off your

rocker!? These people don't have

a sense of humor. Are you trying

to get yourself killed?

MAX

I don't think so... but with me,

any duplicity is possible.

JOAN

Stop it, you... you... you nudnick!

69.

ASHOKA

Who gave you your rickshaw?

HASARI

The Godfather.

ASHOKA

Who provides the food you eat?

HASARI

The Godfather.

ASHOKA

Remember:   Loyalty.

70.

SALADDIN

The Godfather is at least

civilized. The son is vicious.

Remember the last elections -- the

Molotov coctails, the blows with

iron bars. They'll throw us out.

We won't be able to find anyone

else to rent to us. We'll just

have to agree to pay what he

wants.

MEHBOUB

Saladdin's right. Neither nature

nor the people with the power

have any conscience. We have to

pay.

ASHISH

What do you say, Doctor Big

Brother?

SUNIL

I think we must try to break the

Godfather's hold on us.

SUNIL

Please, hear me out. But I think

we have to be very cautious.

MAX

How the hell do you proceed with

caution against these people?

You can't. You have to risk

everything.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

71.

MAX (CONT'D)

You try to negotiate with these

people, you make compromises with

them, they'll eat you alive. Stand

up against them now and they'll

fold. I guarantee it. Underneath,

they're cowards, they got no guts.

We show them we're strong and

the'll just move on to easier

pickings.

ASHISH

We?   You have an airplane ticket.

SUNIL

You know, Max, this is not

American gangster television.

SALADDIN

Yes, if you're wrong, you don't

have to be here.

MAX

I'm not wrong. You bow your heads,

you plead with your Gods to do

what you won't do yourselves.

You put up with this nightmare

as if there were no choice. I'm

telling you, if you don't stand

up to that little pimple face

now, he'll own you for the rest

of your lives.

ANOUAR

Even though I am invisible to some

of you and I don't have a complete

set of legs to stand on, I stand

with the Doctor Big Brother. Maybe

nature doesn't have a conscience

or those with the power, but don't

we?

(CONTINUED)

72.

MARGARETA

I agree with Anouar and Max Daddah.

I think it's worth the chance.

HASARI

Is it permitted to speak?

HASARI

I want my children to be educated

and cared for; this is our home,

we have never had such friends.

But many of us owe a great debt

to the Godfather. He is strong

and could kill us... But we must

choose. I trust my Big Brother.

I say we must stand up.

SUNIL

Sister Joan, what do you think,

really?

JOAN

Well, I think Max has hit on the

heart of what we're trying to build

here: a self-help society. Each

of us has to decide for himself.

As for me, I suppose I think,

really, that if the bastards are

going to suck us dry, I'd like to

get in a couple of good left-

handers before I turn the other

cheek.

SALLADIN

But who will rent to us!

It has come to me tonight to write

Okay -- shott.

Yes -- what is the word -- that

"Irrigation"?

Yes, yes, that word, I want that

word in the letter.

MAX

Well?

RAM

Well?

MAX

What would you like to say to

your wife?

RAM

I don't know, Max Daddah. If I

knew what to say to my wife, I'd

never have left home.

Why do you have to go home, Doctor

Babu?

Because he doesn't live here,

Manooj. This is not his home.

On no! Lepers! Lepers in my

neighborhood!

ANOUAR

Sshh! Doctor Big Brother,

please, we are pretending not

to be lepers.

MAX

Oh, oh, I didn't get the concept

-- of course, not lepers. I think

you're going to fool a lot of

people. I have only one question:

Why are you here?

ANOUAR

We've come to take you to the

dispensary in grand style on this

special day, haven't we, Hasari?

HASARI

Yes.

MAX

Na, I'll just trot alongside Hasari.

HASARI

No, please, get in.

Good morning, Sister to the poor.

Yes, Mr. Bhose?

Those people aren't coming into

They are going to be treated at

the dispensary. You have no

right to stop them.

JOAN

Go ahead, Aloka, take them inside.

JOAN

Take your hands off her, you

waster!

GOONDA

That was a mistake, Doctor.

The mistake's yours, putz.

Get these people inside.

MAX

Oh, little girl, little girl...

JOAN

We'll pay! All right then, so by

all means, protect us!

ASHOKA

In a world such as ours, everyone

needs protection. For the fee we

discussed, from this day forward,

I can assure you nothing like this

will happen again.

ASHOKA

You. I warned you about the

ALOKA

If she's very careful and doesn't

scarring will be minimal.

Do you understand? You can't...

You have to stay here.

You make her stay here.

JOAN

I'll try.

MAX

Don't goddamn try, Joan!   Goddamn

do it!

MAX

I hate this place, I hate this

place, I hate this place.

ASHOKA

Well.    What have you got to say?

HASARI

I told them that your father

provides us with a great deal and

that --

ASHOKA

From this minute, you   are off the

list! You will leave    your rickshaw

here... where it will   be reserved

for a man who deserves   our trust.

HASARI

Please, Babu, this is as if the

ground has opened up. I have to

speak to Mr. Ghatak!

ASHOKA

My father's ill! You are speaking

to me!

HASARI

I have a family!

ASHOKA

The decision is made. I have made

it. Now get out before I have Mr.

Bhose break your legs.

MAX

I just don't... I don't want to...

I don't want to care! I don't want

to care this much! I just don't

want to be invested in you people.

In people! I became a goddamn

doctor because my goddamn father

wanted me to be a goddamn doctor

because he was a goddamn doctor!

He was the goddamn king of

doctors! It's too goddamn hard!

JOAN

Not everyone's cut out for this.

You did the best you could.

Better than many. It's all right.

84.

MAX

I didn't do the best I could! I

did what I always do! I shot my

big mouth off and did a half-assed

job. And what I want to do now is

I want to go back to America and

make money and live a life without

entanglements and demands and

people hanging on me.

JOAN

(a beat)

You know, the fact is from the

minute we're born we're

shipwrecked. Some see that as a

lifetime of drowning, of fear,

others only to endure, but to

triumph. It's all in the

individual spirit, isn't it?

MAX

Got it: To run, to spectate, to

commit.

Running spectator.

JOAN

Then, by all means, go home, Max,

and go with my blessing and my

eternal friendship.

HASARI

They took away my rickshaw.

85.

MAX

So what do you want me to do about

it -- get it back for you?

MAX

I'm sorry. I'm going home.

Because this isn't my fight. I

got one person to look after --

me.

MAX

All right, I'm running out,   okay?

Because I'm a coward, this   is me,

this is what I do, I get in   over

my head, I let people down,   I run.

HASARI

But I trusted you.

MAX

Well, that was your goddamn

mistake!

HASARI

I don't know how I'm going to pay

the rent, how we're going to eat.

ALOKA

We have what is saved for Amrita's

dowry.

HASARI

The children must leave the

school; they'll have to work. And

you will not have anything to do

with the clinic or those people

anymore.

RAM

What I earn is yours, too.

86.

HASARI

You can't support all of us. You

have a family in your village, too.

HASARI

Take more.

HASARI

Take more.

GANGOOLY

Not well, brother?

HASARI

Still stealing from refugees?

GANGOOLY

Well, yes, I remember you, of

course -- hello! I am delighted

to see you -- yes. And tell me

immediately, please -- your little

family, your beautiful children,

everyone eats, yes. Come, have a

cup of tea or a little something

stronger, we must celebrate.

GANGOOLY

Ah, well, you're angry    at me, yes,

I wondered if that was    still on

your mind -- I am full    of regret

about that, yes, even    a little

tormented. What can I     say? I have

the spirit of an eagle    trapped in

the body of a crow.

HASARI

I'm touched.

GANGOOLY

My friend, I am lame and I am poor.

Does that mean that I shouldn't

survive? Huh? When a man is

struggling in a rough sea, he

clutches onto what he can or he

drowns. You don't look so well.

HASARI

I lost my rickshaw.

(CONTINUED)

88.

GANGOOLY

Ach! I  have an offer. No,

listen!  Shiva be my witness, you

must at least think about this.

Please, I can help... Or my name

is not Mr. Gangooly.

HASARI

Which, fortunately, it is.

GANGOOLY

Remove the children from the school

-- no, why? When you, the father,

can make a small sacrifice. Nature

has foreseen your plight. For she

has given you two eyes, yes, and

two kidneys. But. To live, you

have need of one only. I have a

friend who sold his kidney -- this

one -- and now -- believe me, this

is the truth -- he lives in a brick

home... which he owns.

89.

GANGOOLY

Of course, take some time, think

about it. People all over the

world, anxiously waiting, willing

to pay. 15,000 rupees for a

kidney. 25,000 for an eye.

JOAN

Hasari has forbid her to have

anything more to do with us. He'd

be very angry if he knew she was

seeing you off.

MAX

This is for Poomina.   When I get

home...

ALOKA

You did good things.

(chokes up, but

manages)

Thank you for coming to our

country.

JOAN

It's not like  he's royalty or

anything, so  I'm not persuaded we

have to wait  for the plane to

actually take  off.

ALOKA

No.   We should go.

MAX

What were those three choices

again?

FADE OUT.

(CONTINUED)

91.

MAX

I need Aloka at the clinic.

(as Hasari stares)

All right, they, the patients,

need her. She's a good nurse.

(as Hasari stares)

Come on, man, this is between you

and me. Why take the kids out of

school, why punish your wife?

MAX

I have a little money, I can get

it from the States...

HASARI

It's not a question of money.

We'll survive on our own.

ALOKA

Maybe he's right. The clinic is

for everyone and if I am needed --

HASARI

No! I'm your husband and you'll

do as I say! Unless, of course,

you've become an American wife and

then you'll do as you please!

HASARI

Stay away from them. They are not

part of us. They will only be good

to you as long as you please them.

92.

MAX

Hand me the scissors, please.

MAX

Scissors, scissors.

MAX

Not that end -- No, that's fine,

thanks, I've got it.

ANOUAR

Max Daddah, you are finished?

(Max nods)

Follow me.

MAX

You didn't steal this.

RAMATULLAH

The police, Sahib, they stole it.

We stole it from them.

93.

MAX

How much?

MAX

I'd like to show you something.

Just take a minute.

MAX

Go ahead.   Go on.

MAX

I'm good with my hands. You're

good with yours. What do you say?

HASARI

If I were to go on the street with

this machine, I would end up in a

gutter with my throat cut.

(CONTINUED)

94.

MAX

Well, it's yours if you want it.

You know the license, the cops,

all that can be fixed. You'll

own this -- it'll have nothing to

do with the Godfather.

HASARI

Doctor Daddah, I'm just a small

man. Don't try to tempt me again

with big thoughts.

MAX

You didn't want me to quit.    Well,

I came back.

HASARI

But can you be trusted?

MAX

I hope so.

MAX

(to Hasari)

Going to look for work?

95.

RAM

Yes, he is.

MAX

Are you taking your medicine?

RAM

Yes, yes, but look at this.

ALOKA

He's very proud.

96.

MAX

You must have had a good doctor.

Still no running, jumping, picking

up anything heavy. And you stay

here. You're going to help Sister

Joan and you're going to school.

Do you understand?

THE GOONDA

Time to collect the rent, Sister.

JOAN

Of course.     Come with me, please.

HASARI

Close the door!

HASARI

Close the door. The Godfather

HASARI

I was saying to Manooj that if a

man bows down too many times,

there will come a day when he will

no longer be able to stand upright.

I promised Manooj and Shambu I'd

take them to the movies. Is it

all right?

Kumar Kapur or a doctor.

MAX

Ha ha! You can be both! Manooj

Pal, swashbuckling physician!

MANOOJ

You're so much fun, El Max. I

wish my daddy were as much fun as

you.

MAX

I wish my father loved me like

your father loves you. Your dad's

a very special man. And now, en

garde!

MAX

Time out, men. Off the street

till this truck passes.

(CONTINUED)

99.

MAX

I can't do anything here. He's

got a compound fracture, he

hemorrhaging. We've got to get

to a hospital -- now!

JOAN

You'll never get a taxi at this

hour.

100.

MAX

They'll admit him, but we have to

pay for the blood. I gave him all

I had. He wants more. Do you have

anything?

ALOKA

Sister Joan gave me this.

MAX

We haven't got any more!

MAX

If this child dies while you

stand here, I'll kill you.

MAX

Now, I need an X-ray room and I

need an O.R. nurse.

ATTENDANT

Not possible. You can't give

care, you're an American. You

must be an Indian doctor.

(CONTINUED)

101.

MAX

Then take me to one!

INTERN

This way, please.

HASARI

You're my wife, Aloka, you and my

children are all my wealth. But

if Max Daddah and Big Sister Joan

have need of you, you may go to

them.

MAX

We pinned his leg. Couple of

months, he'll be better than

ever. They want to keep him

today. We're a good team.

Gimme five.

(CONTINUED)

102.

JOAN

I don't think it was an accident.

I think they were aiming for Max.

So, what we have to ask ourselves

is whether his presence is

endangering all of us.

ANOUAR

Even from my low vantage point, I

know this: It's the son. He's

mad.

HASARI

Max Daddah is our friend. If

they're trying to harm him, then

they're trying to harm all of us.

We must stand by him as one.

RAM

Doctor Daddah, please, very

important, only one moment.

MAX

This is going to cost me every

rupee I didn't make today.

MAX

A letter from your wife.

MAX

This is postmarked six weeks ago.

RAM

So?

(CONTINUED)

103.

MAX

So, what have you been doing --

incubating it?

RAM

I was afraid.

MAX

'My dear husband...'

RAM

Oh that's very hopeful so far!

MAX

'Your words brought tears of joy

to my arid eyes.'

RAM

Oh, I'm in love! My words

brought tears to her arid eyes!

(then fearful)

What does that mean -- arid?

MANOOJ

I know!   Dry.

MAX

Correct. Her eyes were dry, your

letter irrigated them.

RAM

Aaah!

CHOMOTKAR

This is a puka nasgar. What a

curse that you can't use it.

HASARI

I'm going on the streets tomorrow.

MAX

Listen. I don't want you to think

I'm crazy, but I don't think that

truck was an accident.

(CONTINUED)

104.

MAX CONT'D)

I think Ashoka was after me. You

can bet he'll be after you too.

HASARI

I'm going to speak to his father.

MAX

Can I go with you? I'll go with

you. Can I go with you if I shut

up?

HASARI

Babu, please, I beg you, hear

my words!

GHATAK

Wait.

HASARI

May I say first, Babu, I wish you

long life and good health.

GHATAK

Acha! They take me now to the

scientists. They stick needles in

me, take pictures of my insides,

study them, and then tell me what

I know.

(CONTINUED)

105.

HASARI

When you gave me work, I swore I

would be as your youngest brother.

Your son thinks I have been

disloyal. He took my rickshaw.

With my friend, I have remade this

one. I beg you to let me go again

onto the streets. I have my family.

GHATAK

It is very beautiful.

HASARI

Thank you, Babu.

GHATAK

If I may say, it has an allure.

HASARI

An allure, Babu -- thank you.

GHATAK

The world is chaos. We struggle

to build something permanent,

then our bodies betray us, our sons

betray us.

(to Hasari now)

Yes, you may take your rickshaw

out. If you can face up to my son.

(CONTINUED)

106.

HASARI

If a man dies and he's not burned,

what do you think becomes of his

soul?

HASARI

I must provide for my family.

GANGOOLY

Oh, it's a noble fate. If indeed

your wheel ceases to turn, you will

help educate somewhere in this

great world a fine doctor.

HASARI

What's going on?

CHOMOTKAR

The Godfather ill! The son is

raising the rent!

ASHOKA

Do you know how much it costs to

change the spoke in a wheel? Or

how much baksheesh I have to pay

the police?

(CONTINUED)

107.

RAMATULLAH

We haven't been breaking our

backs between the shafts of our

rickshaws in order to weep for

you!

CHOMOTKAR

The only thing that matters is the

bundle of rupees we take to the

munshi each month to feed and to

answer the daily needs of our

children!

RASSOUL

Listn to me! Listen now! Listen

to me!

(when the pullers

quiet)

Friends! I ask you to vote for an

unlimited strike. Inkalabad

zindabad! Long live the

revolution! Rickshaw Workers Union

zindabad!

ASHOKA

That's what I thought. All

right, get to work! Customers

are waiting!

HASARI

Friends! The Godfather at least

is a caring man! This one,

though, the son --

(CONTINUED)

108.

ASHOKA

We helped this man! We gave  him

a job, a place to live! This  is

how he shows his gratitude.  Get

on the streets now! Or turn  in

your machines!

HASARI

Friends -- don't! If we stand --

SCREEN GOES BLACK.

HASARI

The life of a rickshaw puller is

not one a man would choose if he

had a choice. Our feet blister

and burn up from the boiling

asphalt, our noses burn from the

fumes of countless motor cars and

buses, our backs curve permanently

from the loads we carry hour after

hour, day after day. But I am

proud to be one of the human horses

who carry my countryman from place

to place and I am thankful for the

opportunity to make a living. But

I will not keep silent anymore and

I will not be cheated and

threatened anymore. Life is hard

enough. No more.

(CONTINUED)

109.

JUDGE

Silence!

(when it's silent)

This man will be permitted to

use his rickshaw without let or

hindrance. And I will make a

restraining order against Mr.

Ghatak.

JUDGE

I haven't finished these

proceedings. For his part in this

disturbance, I fine the defendant

50 rupees.

HASARI

Fifty rupees, Your Honor?

That's --

JUDGE

Pay at this time or spend seven

days in jail!

RAMATULLAH

Hasari!

RASSOUL

Hasari!

HASARI

Really -- a boyfriend, Amrita?

AMRITA

No!

(CONTINUED)

111.

MANOOJ

Yes, she does. His name is Subash

Ghosh. His father owns the workshop.

HASARI

Is there someone you care about?

HASARI

Then I must speak to his father

and I must complete your dowry.

HASARI

You will make people sigh at how

beautiful you are. And I shall

drop tears of joy.

RAM

At my wedding I became so

frightened, my father gave me

things to drink to calm me down.

I went out to piss and fell asleep

under the village tree. When I

woke I thought it was the tree I'd

married. I still love that tree.

(CONTINUED)

112.

ASHOKA

Go home, Doctor.

JOAN

What's happened?

MAX

Ashoka ordered me to go home.

Well, I've come home.

CHOMOTKAR

What a joy it is to survey this

disaster! We will all make a

fortune!

(CONTINUED)

113.

HASARI

The monsoon is the great Durga's

gift to the human horse!

HASARI

What's the matter?

RAM

I'm wet and I'm cold. Your

daughter is getting married. Time

is passing. I want to go home to

my wife.

RAMATULLAH

Hasari!

MARWARI #4

How much to the market?

HASARI

Eight rupees.

MARWARI #4

What!   I won't pay it!

HASARI

Who else needs a ride?       I am

available at a price!

MARWARI #4

No!   Take me -- I'll pay, let's

go!

HASARI

The price just went up!       Ten

rupees! In advance.

HASARI

How can I help?

ANOUAR

I think Aloka would have a gentler

touch than you, Max Daddah. Maybe

she should perform this surgery on

her own.

MAX

Last time you told me you were

more than two women could manage.

ANOUAR

Yes, but given a choice between one

and none, I will accept the one.

MAX

Okay, you ought to be good for

another few days. Send in the

next patient.

116.

HASARI

Here!   I'm here!

MR. GHOSH (SUBASH'S FATHER)

You're a rickshaw puller, am I

correct?

HASARI

Yes, that's correct.

MR. GHOSH

And I a partner in the workshop

where your daughter is employed.

Were you aware of that?

HASARI

Yes, yes, I was, my daughter told

me, thank you.

(CONTINUED)

117.

MR. GHOSH

Yes, well then, perhaps you can

tell me why I would permit my son

to marry your daughter.

UNCLE #1

Just a moment, please.

UNCLE #1

Are you saying there's no way

you'd consider this match?

UNCLE #1

Perhaps some inducement?    Would

that be of any help?

MR. GHOSH

(considering this)

What could he possibly offer?

UNCLE #1

Probably nothing. But perhaps,

in fairness, we should find out.

118.

MAX

(shouting to the

others)

My dear friends, it's just

occurred to me what inspired me

to stay here.

MARGARETA

What's that, Doctor Big Brother?

MAX

The opportunity to acquire

waterfront property at a reasonable

price.

JOAN

I hate to admit it, junior, but

that was actually quite witty.

JOAN

Ut-nobody laugh; it's a natural

disaster -- we have guests.

MAX

I'd throw my cape down, but I'm

all out of dry capes.

MAX

It's very nice to see you.   Both

of you.

RAVI

We heard you were still here.

Vijay wanted to send some things.

(CONTINUED)

119.

MAX

Shall we unload the car?

RAVI

Yes, yes, by all means.

MANUBAI

I'm surprised. I really didn't

think you'd stick it out.

MAX

People grow older; sometimes they

even grow up.

ARISTOTLE JOHN

Where can we take them? We can't

take them back to the clinic. No

one will put up with it.

SALADDIN

We can't let them drown, can we?

Eh, Max Daddah?

HASARI

It's too deep!

120.

MEETA

Anouar!

ANOUAR

Max Daddah!

MAX

We're here!   We're here!

OTHERS

It's the doctor. Save Doctor Big

Brother!

122.

MAX

Oh, Jesus, the guy went to sleep

when he was supposed to be working?

I gotta get up --

JOAN

Sshh, sshh, sshh! No heroics,

junior. Lay back. You're all

right.

MAX

All right.

(a distant laugh)

Yeah, I am, I'm all right.

MAX

Want you guys to know something.

About me. Wanted to be the

world's greatest heart surgeon,

just one better than my dad. Just

one. First time I'm the lead

surgeon on a case, the main guy, I

choke. Froze. The chief made me

step aside. My teacher. Had to

take over for me. Went into

radiology. Photography. Had to

have somethin' easy. No pressure.

Wasn't too nuts about myself.

Quit.

MAX

You people... You...

(a beat)

I love you guys.

123.

HASARI

I can offer no more    than I've

offered! No more!      All right,

I'll add two dhotis,    two vests,

and a punjabi. But     that's all.

MR. GHOSH

That's all?     Did he say that's

all?

HASARI

My daughter's qualities will make

up for what is lacking.

SUBASH'S FATHER

Well, it won't do! I am firm in

requiring for my exceptional son

the bicycle, 1000 repees... and

one ounce of gold.

HASARI

That's robbery! The child of a

rajah might be worth that, and

I'm not even sure of that!

Impossible!

SISTER CECILIA

Well, indeed    I think Sister Joan

is right --    we've got a prospect

here. We'll     start you off with a

few classes;    if that works out,

we'll make a    proper student of you.

(CONTINUED)

124.

MAX

Hey, come on, don't do this.

VOICE

Well, what's the problem here?

ASHOKA

You've become very brave of late,

haven't you?

MAX

Don't do this.

ASHOKA

Oh, I do what I please. You see,

my father's dead, I'm in charge

now. So you will get off my

streets, you will leave my

country, and that clinic and

school will close.

(CONTINUED)

125.

MAX

Why?

ASHOKA

My father was weak. He let you

and your European friend give

these little people ideas. It's

over.

MAX

You can't do this!

MAX

Jesus Christ.

HASARI

(to the kids)

Get back! Stay back!

ASHOKA

No, no, come forward.   Come.

ASHOKA

What a little woman already, hey?

HASARI

Please, don't touch her, Babu.

ASHOKA

What did you say?

HASARI

I said, Please, don't touch her.

ASHOKA

She's going to give someone a lot

of enjoyment. Yes.

126.

ASHOKA

He said 'please' didn't he?

'Please, don't touch her?'

ASHOKA

Bhose, help me!

HASARI

Life is hard enough.     No more.

Leave us alone.

GOONDA

You won't be bothered again.

127.

MAX

Why don't you go on home.   I'll

stay with him.

(CONTINUED)

128.

HASARI

A man's journey to the end of his

obligations is a very long road.

And you have to remember that you

can never give up. We pray that

life will bless us, that we will

be kings, with possessions and

money that we can rule over all

around us. But it's a mist; the

only thing that makes it possible

to endure life is our love, one

for the other.

HASARI

I was dreaming the sound of

rickshaw bells, and now I hear

them.

HASARI

Are they here for me?

HASARI

A city so big. When we arrived,

we didn't have a place to live, a

friend.

SHAMBU

(whispering)

Is my father going to die?

MAX

Get serious.

HASARI

Get serious! I've agreed to the

bicycle, I've agreed to the 1000

rupees! I can go no further. I

have nothing more to give!

MAX

How's it going?

RAM

All that stands between them now

is the ounce of gold. Max

Daddah, Joan Di -- is she a good

reader?

MAX

What do you mean?

RAM

She read this letter to me.

( he shows Max)

But I think she must have read it

wrong. She said my wife writes

that irrigation has come to our

village.

MAX

But that's great.

(CONTINUED)

130.

RAM

But it means I should go home to

my wife.

MAX

I thought that's why we've been

writing all these letters.

RAM

Yes, of course, I love her from

here, yes; but, what if I go home

and find I don't love her from

there.

SHAMBU

Daddy needs gold, right?

SHAMBU

Do you think this is pretend gold

or real?

(CONTINUED)

131.

HASARI

You never did belong to me. You

were only lent to me by God until

you marry and continue the wheel

of life.

HASARI

I would be pleased if you would

stand with me in the place of

honor to the right of my daughter.

132.

FADE OUT.
