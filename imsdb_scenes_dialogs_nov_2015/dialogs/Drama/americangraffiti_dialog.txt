WOLFMAN

Awwrigght, baay-haay-baay! I got a

oldie for ya--gonna knock ya right

on de flowa--baay-haay-hee-baay!

TERRY

Hey, whadaya say? Curt? Last night

in town, you guys gonna have a little

bash before you leave?

STEVE

The Moose have been lookin' for you

all day, man.

CURT

(sarcastic)

Oh great...

TERRY

Whadaya got, whadaya got? Wow--two

thousand dollars. Two thousand doll--

!!

STEVE

Mr. Jenning couldn't find you, so he

gave it to me to give to you. He

said he's sorry it's so late, but

it's the first scholarship the Moose

Lodge has given out. Oh yeah, he

says they're all very proud of you.

CURT

Well... ah... why don't you hold

onto it for a while?

STEVE

What's with you? It's yours! Take

it! I don't want it.

TERRY

I'll take it.

CURT

Steve... Ah, I think we'd better

have a talk. I've gotten-

STEVE

Your sister calls. I'll talk to you

later.

CURT

Now, Steve! Let her wait.

STEVE

Okay, make it short and sweet.

CURT

Yeah, well... Listen...

(clearing his throat)

I... I don't think I'm going tomorrow.

STEVE

What! Come on, what are you talking

about?

CURT

I don't know. I was thinking I might

wait for a year... go to city--

STEVE

You chicken fink.

CURT

Wait, let me explain--

STEVE

You can't back out now! After all we

went through to get accepted. We're

finally getting out of this turkey

town and now you want to crawl back

into your cell--look, I gotta talk

to Laurie.

(he hands the check

back to Curt)

Now take it. We're leaving in the

morning. Okay?

STEVE

You wanna end up like John? You can't

stay seventeen forever.

CURT

I just want some time to think. What's

the rush? I'll go next year.

STEVE

We'll talk later.

RADIO

(singing)

"Here comes the Wolfman--Wolfman

Jack!"

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Oh, We're gonna rock and roll

ourselves to death baby. You got the

Wolfman Jack Show!

GIRL

Hi John!

JOHN

Not too good, huh?

CURT

Why is it every girl that comes around

here is ugly? Or has a boyfriend?

Where is the dazzling beauty I've

been searching for all my life?

JOHN

I know what you mean. The pickin's

are really gettin' slim. The whole

strip is shrinking. Ah, you know, I

remember about five years ago, take

you a couple of hours and a tank

full of gas just to make one circuit.

It was really somethin.'

CURT

Hey, John. Someone new in town.

JOHN

Ahhh.

CURT

You gonna go after him?

JOHN

Hey, listen, Professor, if he can't

find me, then he ain't worth racin',

right?

CURT

The big shot!

BUDDA

A cherry-vanilla coke and a chocolate

mountain. Anything else you want,

Steve?

(Steve shakes his

head.)

If there is you let me know now.

Just honk and I'm yours.

BUDDA

One fries--grab it before I drop it.

STEVE

Where was I?

LAURIE

Um, how you thought high school

romances were goofy and we started

going together just because you

thought I was kinda cute and funny,

but then you suddenly realized you

were in love with me, it was

serious... and ah... oh, you were

leadin' up to somethin' kinda big.

STEVE

You make it sound like I'm giving

dictation. Well, seriously, what I

meant was, that ah... since we do

care for each other so much, and

since we should really consider

ourselves as adults. Now, I, ah...

could I have a couple of those fries?

TERRY:

Come on, Budda. Come on...

STEVE

Ah, where was I?

LAURIE

..."consider ourselves adults"...

STEVE

Right... right... anyway, I thought

maybe, before I leave, we could ah...

agree that... that seeing other people

while I'm away can't possibly hurt,

you know?

LAURIE

You mean dating other people?

STEVE

I think it would strengthen our

relationship. Then we'd know for

sure that we're really in love. Not

that there's any doubt.

LAURIE

I think you're right. I mean, we're

not kids anymore, and it's silly to

think that when we're three thousand

miles apart we shouldn't be able to

see other people and go out.

STEVE

Laurie, now, listen, I didn't ask

for that back. I think that...

LAURIE

I know. I just sort of think it's

juvenile now. I'll keep it at home.

It's less conspicuous there.

STEVE

You don't want to wear it?

LAURIE

I didn't say that. I understand and

I'm not upset. I mean, I can't expect

you to be a monk or something while

you're away.

TERRY

...and I have a really sharp record

collection. I even have "Pledging My

Love" by Johnny Ace. Anyway, how can

you love Nelson when he's going out

with Marilyn Gator. Since he dumped

on you maybe we could--

BUDDA

He didn't dump on me, you little

dip. Hi, Steve!

TERRY

She's a little conceited--just playing

hard to get.

STEVE

Listen, I came over here to talk to

you about--

TERRY

Any time, buddy. I'm your man. Nothing

I like better than chewing the rug

with a pal. You talk, I'll listen.

I'm all ears. Shoot.

STEVE

Shut up.

TERRY

Sure.

STEVE

Terry, I'm going to let you take

care of my car while we're away--at

least until Christmas. I'm afraid if

I leave it with my--

STEVE

What's wrong?

CURT

Hey, sis--what's wrong?

LAURIE

Nothing.

STEVE

Now listen, only 30 weight Castrol-

R. I've written the tire pressure

and stuff on a pad in the glove

compartment. Are you listening?

CURT

What's wrong, he's crying!

TERRY

I can't... believe... it.

(He starts toward the

car and gently

caresses its paint.)

I don't know what to say. I'll...

love and protect this car until death

do us part.

(He circles the car.)

This is a superfine machine. This

may even be better than Daryl

Starbird's superfleck moonbird. It

is better than Daryl Starbird's.

TERRY

Budda, how would you like to go to

the drive-in movies with me?

BUDDA

You've got to be kidding!

TERRY

Would I kid you about a thing like

that? I want you to know that

something has happened to me tonight

that is going to change everything.

I've got a new...

TERRY

Car!! All right, who's the wise--

(He turns and sees

John and changes his

tune.)

Oh, John--verrry funny.

(He tries to laugh

with the others.)

JOHN

Hey, did she do that to you?

STEVE

Let's get going. It seems like we've

spent most of our lives in this

parking lot.

TERRY

Hey, Curt, let's bomb around, I wanna

try out my new wheels!

CURT

I'd like to, Toad, but I'm going

with Steve and Laurie to the hop.

I'd just slow you down anyway.

TERRY

Yeah, tonight things are going to be

different.

JOHN

Hey, wait a minute, you're goin' to

the Hop? The Freshman Hop?

CURT

Yeah.

JOHN

Oh, come on, man. That place is for

kids. You two just got your ass out

of there. Don't go back now.

CURT

You ain't got no emotions?

TERRY

We're gonna remember all of the good

times, is what we're gonna do.

JOHN

Yeah, well, go.

CURT

Why don't you come with us?

JOHN

Bullshit, man!

CURT

Come on. For old time's sake.

JOHN

Yeah, yeah... Well, listen. You go.

Go ahead, Curtsy, baby. You go on

over there and you remember all the

good times you won't be having. I

ain't goin' off to some goddamned

fancy college. I'm stayin' right

here. Havin' fun, as usual.

TERRY

Jesus, Milner, you're in a great

mood tonight.

CURT

What's the matter John? Did I say

somethin' wrong? I'm sorry.

JOHN

Ah, man, it's nothin'.

CURT

Well, we'll see you later, okay?

JOHN

Right.

CURT

We'll all do somethin' together. You

know, before Steve leaves.

JOHN

Okay, wait a minute. Now, you're not

going?

CURT

I don't know.

MAN (V.O.)

Wolfman?

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Who is this?

MAN

This is Joe... in Little Rock, way

down in the Valley.

WOLFMAN

You callin' from Little Rock,

California?

MAN

Long distance.

WOLFMAN

My, my, my... listen, man, what kind

of entertainment you got in that

town?

MAN

All we got is you.

JOHN

Hey, Zudo.

PAZUDO

Hey, Milner.

JOHN

Hey, man, what happened to your

flathead?

PAZUDO

Huh?

JOHN

What happened to your flathead?

PAZUDO

Ah, your mother!

JOHN

What?

PAZUDO

Your mother. Hey, we been talkin'

about you.

JOHN

Yeah?

PAZUDO

Yeah. There's a very wicked '55 Chevy

lookin' for you.

JOHN

Yeah, I know.

PAZUDO

Watch out for the cop that's in

Jerry's Cherry.

JOHN

Yeah. All right, thanks.

GUY

Hey, Toad.

GUY

(leaning out the window)

Is that you in that beautiful car?

(Terry nods modestly)

Geez, what a waste of machinery.

GIRL

Hey, kid.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Here we go with another call out of

the station. Can you dig it? Answer

the phone, dummy.

MAN (V.O.)

Pinkie's Pizza

WOLFMAN

Ah, yeah, listen, you got any more

of those secret agent spy-scopes?

MAN

Hit parade on the stethoscope?

WOLFMAN

No. No, the secret agent spy-scope,

man. That pulls in the moon, the sky

and the planets... and the satellites

and the little bitty space men.

MAN

You must have the wrong number,

partner.

WOLFMAN

'Bye.

CURT

What?

CURT

(shouting)

What? What?!!!

STEVE

We didn't say anything.

CURT

Quick! Hang a right!

STEVE

What? Why?

CURT

Cut over to G Street, I've just seen

a vision! She was a goddess. You've

got to catch her!

STEVE

I didn't see anything.

LAURIE

We're not going to spend the night

chasing girls for you.

CURT

I'm telling you, this was the most

perfect, dazzling creature I've ever

seen.

STEVE

She's gone. Forget it.

CURT

She spoke to me. She spoke to me,

right through the window. I think

she said, "I love you."

CURT

That means nothing to you people?

You have no romance, no soul? She--

someone wants me. Someone roaming

the streets wants me! Will you turn

the corner?

JOHN

Oh, oh. Later.

GUY

Alligator.

JOHN

Hey, you're new around here. Where're

you from?

FIRST GIRL

Turlock.

JOHN

Turlock? You know a guy named Frank

Bartlett?

FIRST GIRL

No. Does he go to Turlock High?

JOHN

Well, he used to. He goes to J.C.

now.

FIRST GIRL

Do you go to J.C.?

JOHN

Yeah, sure.

FIRST GIRL

Oh, wow! Do you know Guy Phillips?

JOHN

Yeah, sure. I got him in a class.

FIRST GIRL

He's so boss.

JOHN

How would you like to ride around

with me for awhile?

FIRST GIRL

I'm sorry, I can't. I'm going steady.

JOHN

Ah, come on!

FIRST GIRL

I just can't.

JOHN

You're just ridin' around with a

bunch of girls. Hey, how about

somebody else in there? Anybody else

want to go for a ride?

JOHN

Aw, come on... I got plenty of room.

It's dangerous to have that many

people in a car. Cops see ya, you're

had. You got nothing to fear, I'm as

harmless as a baby kitten.

CAROL

I'll go. I'll go.

FIRST GIRL

Judy's sister wants to ride with

you. Is that all right?

JOHN

(grinning)

Yeah, sure, Judy--her sister--her

mother--anybody. I'll take 'em all.

Listen, we'll go up and stop at that

light. It'll turn red by the time we

get there. All right?

JOHN

You ever get tired of going steady

with somebody that ain't around--I'm

up for grabs.

JOHN

So, you're Judy's little sister.

JOHN

Ah, shit,--how old are you?

CAROL

Old enough. How old are you?

JOHN

I'm too old for you.

CAROL

You can't be that old.

JOHN

Listen, listen. I think you better

go back and sit with your sister.

Hey, ah... where are they, anyway?

They comin' back or somethin'? This

is a joke, right? This better be a

joke, 'cause I'm not drivin' you

around.

CAROL

But you asked me. What's the matter?

Am I too ugly?

(on the verge of tears)

Judy doesn't want me with her and

now you don't want me with you. Nobody

wants me... even my mother and father

hate me. Everybody hates me.

JOHN

No they don't. I mean, I don't know,

maybe they do. But I don't. It's

just that you're a little young for

me.

CAROL

I am not! If you throw me out I'll

scream.

JOHN

OK, OK, just stay cool. There's no

need to scream. We'll think of

something.

(He looks at her as

she wipes her eyes.)

It shouldn't take too long to find

your sister again.

VOICE (O.S.)

Hey John--you gonna be there tonight?

JOHN

Oh, shit! Hey, get down!

JOHN

Hey, cool...

CAROL

Hey, is this what they call copping

a feel?

JOHN

NO! Uh uh. N-O. Don't even say that.

Jesus...

CAROL

What's your name?

JOHN

Mud, if anybody sees you.

TERRY

What you got in there, kid?

KID

More than you can handle.

OLDER MAN

Excuse me, but I think we've had an

accident.

TERRY

Well, goddamnit, I won't report you

this time, but next time just watch

it, will ya?

SALESMAN

I'll give you $525 for her on a

practically new Corvette... and on

top of this, I'm going to know 10%

off the low price of this beautiful

Vette. I'm talking about only $98

down and $98 a month. Now, how am I

able to make you this incredible

offer? I'll tell you! I'm forced to

move all the sporty cars off the lot

as quickly as I can. Boss's orders.

He doesn't want 'em. I think it's a

mistake, but what can I do?

HERBIE AND THE HEARTBEATS

One, two, three, four-- one, two

three, four-- BAH... BAH... BAH...

BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH...

BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH... BAH...

BAH... BAH... BAH... At the hop!!

PEG

Hey, why are you so depressed? You'll

forget him in a week. Listen, after

you're elected senior queen you'll

have so many boys after your bod--

LAURIE

I don't want to go out with anybody

else.

PEG

Laurie, I know it's a drag but you

can't--remember what happened to

Evelyn Chelnick? When Mike went to

the Marines? She had a nervous

breakdown and was acting so wacky

she got run over by a bus.

LAURIE

I just wish I could go with him or

something.

PEG

Laurie, jeez... Come on.

STEVE

What's that?

EDDIE

What's what?

STEVE

Hey, zit make-up!

(laughing)

Wait till I tell--hey, everybody,

Eddie--

EDDIE

Come on, Steve--don't. Just cool it.

STEVE

(quietly)

Let me see some of that stuff.

EDDIE

You leave tomorrow?

EDDIE

You and Laurie engaged yet?

STEVE

No, but we got it worked out. We're

still going together but we can date

other people.

EDDIE

And screw around--I hear college

girls really give out.

STEVE

Come on.

LAURIE

Come on what?

STEVE

Let's dance.

LAURIE

No thanks.

STEVE

Laurie, I want to dance.

LAURIE

Who's stopping you?

STEVE

(under his breath)

Laurie, I thought since this was our

last night together for 3 months,

you might want to dance with me.

LAURIE

How sentimental. You'll be back at

Christmas.

STEVE

I want to dance now, not at Christmas.

LAURIE

Get your cooties off me--

LAURIE

Go ahead, slug me, scar my face. I

wouldn't dance with you if you were

the last guy left in this gym.

EDDIE

Uh, Peg, I think we should dance.

PEG

No, this is getting good.

LAURIE

I'll dance with you, Eddie. You don't

mind, do you, Peggy?

PEG

Joe College strikes out.

MR. WOLFE (O.S.)

Hey--Curtis!

MR. WOLFE

Curtis, come here. Help me, will

you? I'm surrounded.

GIRL

You won't dance? Come on.

MR. WOLFE

No, really, I'd like to, but I can't.

I mean, if old Mr. Simpson came in

here and saw me dancing with one of

you sexy little--excuse me... one of

you young ladies, he'd have my rear

end.

GIRLS

Aahhh.

MR. WOLFE

Hey, Warren. Come on, gentlemen,

back inside. Put 'em out. Let's go.

CURT

(grinning as he pulls

out a pack of

cigarettes)

Kids... Want one?

MR. WOLFE

(taking one from the

pack)

All right. Hey, I thought you'd left.

CURT

No, not yet.

(looking for matches)

I have no matches.

MR. WOLFE

Brother, how do I get stuck with

dance supervision? Will you tell me

that?... You going back East? Boy, I

remember the day I went off. Got

drunk as hell the night before. Just--

CURT

Blotto.

MR. WOLFE

Blotto. Exactly. Barfed on the train

all the next day.

CURT

(grinning)

Cute. Very cute. Where'd you go again?

MR. WOLFE

Middlebury. Vermont. Got a

scholarship.

CURT

And only stayed a semester.

MR. WOLFE

(smiling and nodding)

One semester. And after all that, I

came back here.

CURT

Why?

MR. WOLFE

(shrugging)

Decided I wasn't the competitive

type. I don't know... maybe I was

scared.

CURT

Well, you know I might find I'm not

the competitive type myself.

MR. WOLFE

What do you mean?

CURT

Well, I'm not really sure that I'm

going.

MR. WOLFE

Hey, now--don't be stupid. Go.

Experience life. Have some fun,

Curtis.

JANE (O.S.)

Bill?

JANE

I mean--Mr. Wolfe. Can I speak with

you a minute.

(She smiles at Curt.)

Hi, Curt.

CURT

Jane...

MR. WOLFE

Anyway--good luck, Curtis.

CURT

Yeah... I'll see you. Thanks a lot.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

A Wolfman exclusive for ya now. The

Beach Boys, baby, a brand new group.

I predict they gonna go a long way.

This is called "Surfin' Safari."

CAROL

So the next night we found out where

they parked and went out with

ammunition.

JOHN

Don't you have homework or something

to do?

CAROL

No sweat--my mother does it. Anyway,

he thought he was had. He started

the car and couldn't see through the

windshield--and zoomed straight into

the canal--it was a riot.

CAROL

I still got some, so don't try

anything.

JOHN

Hey, watch it will ya! Jesus Christ,

thanks a lot.

(looking at her angrily)

Hey, drivin' is a serious business.

I ain't havin' no accidents because

of you.

JOHN

(catching her look)

Come on, don't give me any grief.

I'm warning ya.

CAROL

Spare me, killer.

CAROL

Why'd you do that?

JOHN

I don't like that surfing shit. Rock

'n Roll's been going downhill ever

since Buddy Holly died.

CAROL

Don't you think the Beach Boys are

boss!

JOHN

You would, you grungy little twerp.

CAROL

Grungy? You big weenie, if I had a

boyfriend he'd pound you.

JOHN

(looking in the rear-

view mirror)

Sure--ah, shit, Holstein!

CAROL

Good, a cop--I'm going to tell him

you tried to rape me.

JOHN

Oh, no--No. Hey--

CAROL

It's past my curfew. I'm going to

tell him how old I am, my parents

don't know I'm out and you tried to

rape me. Boy, are you up a creek.

JOHN

Hey--ah, really--don't say anything.

CAROL

If you say "I was a dirty bird.

Carol's not grungy, she's bitchin'."

CAROL

Say it--I'll tell him.

JOHN

(quietly)

I was a dirty bird, Carol's not

grungy, she's bitchin.'

CAROL

Okay--I'll think about it.

HOLSTEIN

Where you going, Milner?

JOHN

I'm going home--sir.

HOLSTEIN

Where you been, Milner?

JOHN

Ah--at the movies--sir.

HOLSTEIN

Milner, you weren't around the 12th

and G streets at about 8:30, were

you?

JOHN

No, I wa at the movies--like I said--

sir.

HOLSTEIN

Uh-huh. Milner, the reason I stopped

you was because the light on your

license plate is out.

(opening his ticket

book)

I'm gonna have to cite you for that.

And Milner, the front end of this...

this... this thing you're driving

looks a little low.

JOHN

Oh, no sir. It's twelve and a half

inches. Regulation size. Now, it's

been checked several times. You can

check it if you like, sir.

HOLSTEIN

Look, Milner.

JOHN

Yes, sir.

HOLSTEIN

You can't fool with the law.

JOHN

Yes, sir.

HOLSTEIN

We know that was you tonight. We

have an excellent description of

this car. I could run you in right

now and I could make it stick. But

I'm not gonna do that, Milner, you

know why?

HOLSTEIN

Because I want to catch you in the

act. And when I do, I'm gonna nail

you, but good. Happy Birthday, Milner.

JOHN

Thank you--asshole.

CAROL

(looking over at him)

You're a regular J.D.

JOHN

Here, file that under C.S. over there.

CAROL

C.S.? What's that stand for?

JOHN

Chicken shit--that's what it is.

CAROL

Oh...

GIRLFRIEND

Ain't he neat?

FALFA

Hey, you know a guy around here with

a piss yellow deuce coupe--supposed

to be hot stuff?

TERRY

You mean John Milner?

TERRY

Hey, nobody can beat him, man. He's

got the fastest--

FALFA

I ain't nobody, dork. Right?

TERRY

Right...

FALFA

Hey, you see this Milner, you tell

him I'm lookin' for him, huh? Tell

him I aim to blow his ass right off

the road.

GIRLFRIEND

(giving another snotty

smile)

Ain't he neat?

TERRY

What a babe... what a bitchin' babe...

And Wolfman Baby, she's all mine.

TERRY

Okay, honey, here I come--James Dean

lives!

TERRY

Stay cool, honey--don't let those

creeps bug you. Wolfman, please don't

let those creeps bug her... please.

TERRY

Hi!

(lowering his voice)

Hello... buenos noches? Need a lift?

Nice night for a walk? Do you know

John Milner? Curt Henderson? Sure

you wouldn't like a ride somewhere?

Did anyone ever tell you that you

look just like Connie Stevens?

TERRY

You do! I mean it! Just like Connie

Stevens. I met her once.

DEBBIE

For real?

TERRY

Yeah. At a Dick Clark road show.

DEBBIE

You really think I look like her?

TERRY

No shit--excuse me, I mean I'm not

just feeding you a line. You look

like Connie Stevens. What's your

name?

DEBBIE

Debbie. I always though I looked

like Sandra Dee.

TERRY

Oh yeah--well, you look a lot like

her too.

DEBBIE

This your car?

TERRY

Yeah. I'm Terry the--they call me

Terry the Tiger.

DEBBIE

It's really tough looking.

TERRY

What school do you go to?

DEBBIE

Dewey--can it lay rubber?

TERRY

Oh yeah, it's got a 327 Chevy mill

with six Strombergs.

DEBBIE

Wow--bitchin' tuck and roll. I just

love the feel of tuck and roll

upholstery.

TERRY

You do?

DEBBIE

Yeah.

TERRY

Well, come on in--I'll let you feel

it. I mean, you can touch it if you

want--

(realizing it's coming

out wrong he gets

nervous)

I mean the upholstery, you know.

DEBBIE

Okay.

DEBBIE

Peel out.

TERRY

What?

DEBBIE

Peel out. I love it when guys peel

out.

GIRL

--a great band and they came all the

way from Stockton. Let's hear it.

GIRL

And we want to thank Darby Langdon,

who did all these neat decorations.

LAURIE

I don't care if you leave this second.

GIRL

(into the mike)

Now the next dance is gonna be a

snowball and leading it off is last

year's class president Steven Bolander--

and this year's head cheerleader,

Laurie Henderson.

STEVE

What's wrong with you! You're acting

like a snotty--

LAURIE

Oh God, come on.

STEVE

Come on what?

LAURIE

(pulling him toward

the floor)

Oh, Steven--please, everybody's

watching. Smile or something.

LAURIE

You think I care if you go off. You

think I'm going to crack up or

something. Are you conceited!

STEVE

Quit--quit pinching--I don't know

why I ever started taking you out in

the first place.

LAURIE

You take me out? When we first met

you didn't have enough sense to take

the garbage out... I asked you out,

remember?

STEVE

What do you mean, you asked me out!

LAURIE

Backwards Day--remember? If I had

waited for you to ask me--even after

that you didn't call me for two weeks.

STEVE

I was busy.

LAURIE

You were scared. Dave Oboler told

me. Then when you did ask me out you

didn't kiss me for three dates.

STEVE

Well--I was--

LAURIE

Scared--Jim Kaylor told me. I even

asked my father why you hadn't kissed

me.

STEVE

Your father--great!

LAURIE

He said he thought you were bright

and you'd probably think of kissing

me after a while.

LAURIE

You didn't, of course. I had to.

Remember that picnic?

STEVE

Out at the canyon?

LAURIE

Oh boy! You can't remember anything--

the first one, up at the lake. That

was the first time you kissed me--I

practically had to throw myself at

you.

STEVE

(quietly)

I remember.

STEVE

What's wrong?

LAURIE

Go to hell.

WENDY

What are you doin', stealing hub

caps?

CURT

Well--hey, Wendy.

WENDY

How've you been?

CURT

Fine. Great. How've you been?

WENDY

I'm coming--wait a sec.

(turning back to Curt)

She's got her car. Hey, I thought

you were going away to school.

CURT

Ah, maybe... maybe.

WENDY

Same old Curt. All the time we were

going together you never knew what

you were doing... well, anyway, I

gotta go.

CURT

Hey, Wendy--where are you going?

WENDY

Nowhere.

CURT

(smiling at her)

Well, you mind if I come along?

WENDY

(affectionately)

Okay.

CURT

Okay.

MR. KROOT

All right, Bolander, break it up.

You know the rules. You and your

panting girlfriend want to do that

you'll have to go someplace else.

STEVE

Hey, Kroot!

STEVE

Why don't you go kiss a duck.

KROOT

What? What did you say?

STEVE

I said go kiss a duck, marblehead.

MR. KROOT

Bolander--you're suspended. You're--

don't even come Monday. You are out!

STEVE

(smiling broadly)

I graduated last semester.

STEVE

(to Laurie)

Get your shoes. Let's go before we

get thrown out.

MAN (V.O.)

Hello, Wolfman.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Who's this?

MAN

This is Weird Willard.

WOLFMAN

Hold on a minute, let me get my pants

off... you understand?

STEVE

Why don't we go to the canal?

LAURIE

(teasing)

What for?

STEVE

Listen, I can get tough with you

too, you know.

LAURIE

Yeah, hard tough.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

I got 'em down around my knees, man.

Wear these tight pants. I can't get

'em... All right, I'm gonna do my

little dance now, man.

TERRY

I go to Dewey too, ya know.

DEBBIE

I never seen ya.

TERRY

I bug out a lot. When I graduate,

I'm going to join the Marines.

DEBBIE

They got the best uniforms. But what

if there's a war?

TERRY

With the bomb, who's going to start

it? We'd all blow up together. Anyway,

I'd rather be at the front. I'm like

that--rather be where the action is,

you know. Once I got in a fight with--

DEBBIE

I love Eddie Burns.

TERRY

Eddie Burns--oh, yeah, Eddie Burns.

I met him once, too.

DEBBIE

You really think I look like Connie

Stevens? I like her--Tuesday Weld is

too much of a beatnik, don't you

think?

TERRY

Yeah, beatniks are losers.

DEBBIE

Who do you like? I mean, singers and

stuff.

TERRY

Ah hell--I like most of the people

you like.

DEBBIE

(putting her head on

his shoulder)

That's nice--we got a lot in common.

DEBBIE

You know what I'd like more than

anything in the world right now?

DEBBIE

I'd love a double Chubby Chuck. Isn't

that what you'd like more than

anything right now?

TERRY

(quietly)

Sure...

TERRY

A double Chubby Chuck, a Mexicali

Chili Barb, two orders of French

fries--

DEBBIE

And cherry cokes.

INTERCOM

Ark, wark, dork.

TERRY

(pushing the button)

Now wait a minute. What? Huh?

INTERCOM

Ark, wark, dork.

TERRY

Yeah, right. Cool.

VIC

Hey, Deb. How's my soft baby?

DEBBIE

Beat it, Vic. I'm not your baby.

VIC

Oh, come on, honey. So I never called

you back. I've been, you know, busy...

DEBBIE

Three weeks... besides, it only took

one night for me to realize that if

brains were dynamite, you couldn't

blow your nose.

VIC

Look who's talking. Who's the wimp

you're hanging out with now? Einstein?

DEBBIE

Tiger happens to be very intelligent.

Unlike you. I know every thing your

dirty little mind is thinking...

(She looks out the

window, down at Vic's

pants)

...it shows...

TERRY

Hey, now--

(his voice cracks)

I mean, hey now, buddy, the lady

obviously doesn't--

VIC

Look, creep, you want a knuckle

sandwich?

TERRY

Ah, no thanks, I'm waiting for a

double Chubby--Chuck...

VIC

Then shut your smart ass mouth! I'll

call ya, Deb, some night when I'm

hard up.

DEBBIE

I won't be home.

TERRY

You seem to, ah--know a lot of weird

guys.

DEBBIE

That sex fiend is not a friend of

mine; he's just horny. That's why I

like you, you're different.

TERRY

I am? You really think I'm

intelligent?

DEBBIE

Yeah. And I'll bet you're smart enough

to get us some brew.

TERRY

Brew?

DEBBIE

Yeah.

TERRY

Brew... oh--yeah... oh, sure...

(she kisses him)

Yes! Liquor! This place is too crowded

anyway.

CAR HOP

What about your double Chubby Chuck,

mexicali-chili-barb and

(looking at the tray)

--two cherry cokes, sir?

CURT

There--don't you see it? Speed up,

you're losing her--

BOBBIE

Quit shouting in my ear!

CURT

Cut around him, cut around him.

CURT

There, hang a right--over there!

CURT

You lost her!

WENDY

What's wrong with you? You know Bobbie

gets nose bleeds when she's upset.

BOBBIE

I do not! You shut up!

CURT

Lost her again. Ah, Wendy, my old

lover, come back here and console

me.

WENDY

Eat your heart out. Who was she

anyway?

CURT

I don't know, but I'm going to find

out.

BOBBIE

I know her!

CURT

Okay, come on, who is she?

BOBBIE

You know Mr. Beeman? He owns Hepcat

Jewelers.

CURT

Yeah.

BOBBIE

Well, she's his wife.

CURT

But she was young and beautiful, and

cruising 10th Street. You're thinking

of someone else.

WENDY

Mr. Beeman's not so old.

CURT

What cruel fate keeps me from my

true love? How am I ever going to

meet her?

WENDY

(to Bobbie)

Did you know that my ex is going to

become a presidential aide? It's

supposed to be a secret, but his big

ambition in life is to shake hands

with President Kennedy. How are you

going to accomplish that at J.C.?

CURT

Maybe I've grown up. Maybe I've

changed my mind.

WENDY

Maybe you don't think you can do it!

CURT

Maybe you should shut up!

WENDY

Maybe I will... and maybe I won't.

CURT

Why don't you move your bod into aft

chamber, where we might discuss this

in private.

BOBBIE

(seeing that Wendy is

considering it)

Thanks a lot.

CURT

Come on, Wendy? She doesn't say

anything. They pull up to a stoplight.

Wendy looks at the red stoplight and

then abruptly gets out of the car

and jumps in the back.

WENDY

Well, slide over, I'm not sitting on

your lap.

CURT

To the Opera, James.

BOBBIE

Drop dead.

CURT

Unless you want to go to Gallo Dam

and have an orgy.

WENDY

You wish.

WENDY

I've been silly. I'm glad you're

going to stay. Maybe we'll have some

classes together.

CURT

Maybe.

BOBBIE

(from the front seat)

Look, there's Kip Pullman! He's so

neat.

BOBBIE

Do you know Kip?

CURT

Huh? Yeah, I know him.

BOBBIE

Talk to him when we go by.

CURT

What do you want me to say?

BOBBIE

Anything... I just want to meet him.

CURT

Kip, baby, what's up?

KIP

Henderson, long time no see. Whadaya

been doing?

CURT

Not much, just wanted to let you

know that Bobbie here is hopelessly

in love with you and trembles at the

sight of your rippling biceps...

BOBBIE

You creep, fink, son-of-a-bitch--

CURT

Help, wait! Joke--Joke--Bobbie,

remember your nose bleeds!

BOBBIE

Get out--get out of my car--I hate

you!

CURT

Excuse me--ouch--Wendy--I got to go

now.

WENDY

Curt, I hope I see you at

registration. Call me if you want.

It was nice seeing you again.

CURT

See ya.

CURT

Oh shit--there!! Wait!

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Went to a dance lookin' for romance.

Found Barbara Ann... baby... Hey,

this one is for all you out there

watchin' the Submarine Races.

CAROL

I'm so thirsty, I could die. Just a

little 10 cent coke to wet my whistle.

It won't take a minute, I can drink

it in the--

JOHN

Why don't you just get out and get

one then! So long, goodbye, hasta

lumbago.

JOHN

All right, one coke and then home.

CAROL

Isn't it great, the way I can cry

whenever I want. A lot of people

can't do that, but Vicki showed me

how. I bet you can't cry.

JOHN

Don't count on it. I may surprise

you any minute now.

JOHN

(into intercom)

One ten cent coke. Is ice extra? All

right, ice.

CAROL

Thanks for nothing.

CAROL

Oh rats, I though some of my friends

might be here.

JOHN

Probably a couple of weeks past their

bedtime.

CAROL

Wait, there's Dee Dee. I hope she

sees me.

JOHN

Oh Shit, Dee Dee!

AL

Hiya, John. Say, do you think if I

brought my Mopar by the shop Monday

you could spot weld the bumper

bracket?

JOHN

Have to be before noon.

AL

Sure. Hey, have you met Linda?

JOHN

No. Hi--ahh, this is my, ahh, cousin,

Carol. I'm kinda babysitting tonight.

CAROL

Babysitting!!

JOHN

Jesus--watch it, will yuh?

(smiling at Al)

Been hittin' me all night. Kids will

be kids, you know.

JOHN

Watch out--damn it! Look what--why

don't you grow up!

(looking at Al again)

We don't get along too well. It's

been like this--

CAROL

You spastic creep!

JOHN

We don't get along too well. You

know what cousins are like.

AL

Yeah... well, I'll see ya on Monday

before noon.

CAROL

Hi cousin, how's your bod?

DEBBIE

Do you have an ID?

TERRY

No... hey, but no sweat. What'll it

be? Beer, little wine?

DEBBIE

If you could get some Old Harper,

I'd give you a French kiss.

TERRY

Old Harper, rrright! He gives her an

OK sign with his fingers and goes

over to the store. He starts to enter,

then stops and thinks. He sees a man

in a business suit approaching, and

smiles.

TERRY

Excuse me, sir, while you're in there--

I mean, since you're going in anyway,

I wonder if--

MAN

Yes, son?

TERRY

Could you--sir--could you give me

the time?

MAN

(looking at his watch)

Why sure, it's a quarter to twelve.

TERRY

Great. Quarter to twelve. Thanks a

lot.

TERRY

Pardon me, sir, but I lost my I.D.

in--in a flood and I'd like to get

some Old Harper, hard stuff. Would

you mind buying a bottle for me?

BUM

Why certainly, I lost my wife, too--

her name wasn't Idy, though, and it

wasn't in a flood--but I know what

ya--

TERRY

Thanks, here's enough for a pint.

TERRY

Hi. Still quarter to twelve.

MAN

Right-o. Night.

TERRY

Night.

TERRY

(gesturing through

the window from

outside)

Hey, no. Not wine. Ssss--hey!

TERRY

(smiling at the owner)

Hi there--ah, say--was there an old

man in here a minute ago?

OWNER

Yeah. He went out the back.

OWNER

You want something?

TERRY

Yeah--ah--let me have a Three

Musketeers, ah, and a ball point pen

ther, a comp, a pint of Old Harper,

couple of flashlight batteries and

some of this beef jerky.

OWNER

Okay, got an I.D. for the liquor?

TERRY

A what? Oh, sure--

(feeling his pockets)

Oh nuts, I left it--I left it in the

car.

OWNER

Sorry, you'll have to get it before--

TERRY

Well, I can't. I also ah, forgot the

car.

DEBBIE

Hey, did ya get it? Ya get it, ya

get it?

DEBBIE

You got it. You got it!

DEBBIE

You didn't get it. Why didn't you

get it?

TERRY

Ah, well, I needed some things and I

thought as long as I was in there--

look, Debbie, can you loan me a

dollar?

DEBBIE

What? Are you for real? Come on.

Girls don't pay. Guys pay.

TERRY

Yeah, well, see--I've only got a

fifty and he doesn't have change.

DEBBIE

Well, I can't believe this... I really

cannot believe this. Here.

TERRY

Hi--excuse me. I was wondering--could

you, ah--

GUY

Buy you a bottle of booze. Yeah, I

know. You lost your I.D. What kind

do you want?

TERRY

(amazed)

Gee, that's terrific. Ah, just some

ah--Old Harper.

JOHN

That's Freddy Benson's Vette... he

got his head on with some drunk.

Never had a chance. Damn good driver,

too. What a waste when somebody gets

it and it ain't even their fault.

CAROL

Needs a paint job, that's for sure.

JOHN

That Vette over there. Walt Hawkins,

a real ding-a-ling. Wrapped it around

a fig tree out on Mesa Vista with

five kids in it. Draggin' with five

kids in the car, how dumb can you

get? All the ding-a-lings get it

sooner or later. Maybe that's why

they invented cars. To get rid of

the ding-a-lings. Tough when they

take someone with them.

CAROL

You never had a wreck though--you

told me.

JOHN

I come pretty close a couple of times.

Almost rolled once. So far I've been

quick enough to stay out of here.

The quick and the dead.

CAROL

I bet you're the fastest.

JOHN

I've never been beaten--lot of punks

have tried. See that '41 Ford there?

Used to be the fastest wheels in the

valley. I never got a chance to race

old Earl. He got his in '55 in the

hairiest crash ever happened around

here. He was racing a '54 Chevy,

bored and loaded, out on the old

Oakdale Highway and every damn kid

in town was out there. The Chevy

lost its front wheel doing about 85.

The idiot had torched the spindles

to lower the front end and it snapped

right off. He slammed bam into the

Ford and then they both of them

crashed into a row of cars and all

those kids watchin! Jesus, eight

kids killed including both drivers,

looked like a battlefield. Board of

Education was so impressed they filmed

it. Show it now in Drivers Education,

maybe you'll see it. Anyway, since

then street racing's gone underground.

No spectators, I mean. Too bad.

CAROL

I'd love to see you race.

JOHN

Come on! None of that.

CAROL

Whadaya mean? I'm the one who's

supposed to say that. Whadaya afraid

of? I'll keep it above the waist.

JOHN

Funny...

(he looks at her for

a moment)

Who knows, in a few years--but not

now, bunny rabbit.

CAROL

Bunny rabbit! Oh brother, you are

such a drip.

JOHN

Come on, open the door.

CAROL

If you say "Carol's not a bunny,

she's a foxy little tail."

JOHN

(quietly)

Carol's not a rabbit, she's a foxy

little tail.

CAROL

You say the cutest things.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Sneakin' around with the Wolfman,

Baby.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Oh, this is gonna strike a raw nerve,

mama. Here's the Platters.

JOE

Whadaya doin', creep?

CURT

Me?

JOE

No, I'm talking to the other fifty

creeps here. You know Gil Gonzales?

CURT

Gil Gonzales... no.

JOE

Don't know Gil... you oughta. You

really should.

CURT

Yeah... why?

JOE

No reason... he's a friend of ours...

and that's his car you're sitting

on.

JOE

Hey, where ya goin?

CURT

(turning)

No place. Not going any place.

JOE

Ya must be going someplace--I mean

ya left here. Bring him over here,

Ants, I want to show him something.

JOE

Here--bend down, look here. See that?

Right across there--see?

CURT

I guess so--yeah.

JOE

You scratched it, man. Where do you

get off sitting on Gil's car, huh,

man?

CURT

I'm sorry. It's not much of a scratch.

I don't think he'll even--

JOE

It ain't the size that's in question

here. It's the principle. Jeez, this

is tough... what should we do with

ya?

ANTS

Tie him to the car and drag him.

CURT

That's funny

(clearing his throat)

Hey, you guys know Toby Juarez? He's

a Pharoah, isn't he?

JOE

Toby Juarez. Yeah, sure we know Toby.

CURT

He's a friend of mine.

JOE

Sure, good old Toby. He's a friend

of yours. That's cool... we all hate

his guts.

CURT

Oh--well, I don't know him that much

anyway.

JOE

We killed him last night.

ANTS

Tied him to a car and dragged him.

JOE

This is going to take some thinking.

You better come with us maybe.

(putting his arm around

Curt)

Go riding with the Pharoahs...

CURT

Well, I don't think I can--I gotta--

JOE

I know just how ya feel.

CARLOS

Shotgun!

ANTS

No, I called it!

CARLOS

When?

ANTS

Before we picked you up.

CARLOS

You can't call it for the whole night,

man. I got it now. Get in the back.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Who is this on the Wolfman telephone?

OPERATOR (V.O.)

Hello, Collect...

WOLFMAN

Pardon me. Your name is Colette?

OPERATOR

Yes. Collect Call.

WOLFMAN

Your name is Colette Call?

OPERATOR

Sir, this is the Operator.

WOLFMAN

Are you French, Operator?

OPERATOR

This is a collect call for Wolfman

Jack.

WOLFMAN

I... I love you, Operator.

OPERATOR

Is this Wolfman Jack?

WOLFMAN

Is Floyd there?

OPERATOR

It's for a Wolfman... Jack...

CAROL

I just love listening to the Wolfman.

My Mom won't let me at home. Because

he's a Negro, I think... anyway,

he's terrific. Do you know that he

just broadcasts from a plane that

flies around in circles all the time?

Do you think that's true?

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Floyd, I love you, Floyd. Is this

you, Floyd? I cannot look on thee,

love took my hand... and smiling did

reply, who made the eyes but I. Floyd,

reach out and touch my soul.

OPERATOR (V.O.)

Your party's ready, sir.

WOLFMAN

You mean Floyd? Hello, is this Floyd?

VOICE (V.O.)

Hello, is this Matilda?

WOLFMAN

No, it ain't honey--bye!

CARLOS

You tell her, Wolfman. He's my man.

When I graduate, I'm gonna be a

Wolfman. Hey, you know he broadcasts

out of Mexico someplace?

JOE

No, he don't. I seen the station

right outside of town.

CARLOS

That's just a clearing station, man.

So he can fool the cops. He blasts

that thing all the way around the

world. It's against the law, man.

ANTS

Ah, man--they'll never catch the

Wolfman.

ANTS

Hey, man, who cut the cheese?

JOE

He who smelt it, dealt it.

(looking at Curt in

the back)

Hey, creep, scoot down. Sitting up

like that, it wrecks the lines of

the car, you know what I mean?

JOE

There's that badass Chevy again.

Look at he snatch he's got with him.

ANTS

Hey, man, he looks like a whimp.

CURT

Probably is. Whimps get all the

snatch.

CARLOS

Milner ain't gonna beat that. His

time has come. He's getting old. He

ain't as fast as he used to be.

JOHN

You got two seconds to get your ass

over in the corner.

CAROL

Don't worry, I won't rape you.

GIRL

You got a bitchin' car.

GIRL

In fact, we're gonna give you our

special prize for having the neatest

car around. You want me to give it

to you?

JOHN

If the prize is you, honey, I'm a

ready Teddy.

GIRL

Yeah, well get bent turkey.

CAROL

All right, very funny. What a chop.

Ha ha. Quit laughing!!

CAROL

Let's catch 'em at the light. Then

you jump out and flatten their tires.

JOHN

Hey, wait a--

CAROL

Just do what I say!

JOHN

Yezz, bozz....

TERRY

Tootie fruiti all ruti... It's Super

Cola!

TERRY

It's a... a little... strong, I think.

DEBBIE

(drinking)

It's the living end.

TERRY

Yeaah, I guess it wasn't mixed.

DEBBIE

Wow, it's pretty tonight. It's a

perfect night to go horseback riding--

I was going with a guy once who had

a horse.

TERRY

Oh yeah? I used to have a couple of

horses myself.

DEBBIE

Really?

TERRY

I used them for hunting. I do a lot

of hunting. Deer mostly, although I

got a couple of bear last year. Yep,

they were good ponies--hunting ponies.

I had to train 'em special, you know.

DEBBIE

Do you still have 'em? We could go

for a ride.

TERRY

No, I had to sell 'em. To get these

wheels... and a jeep. I also have a

jeep pick-up, with four-wheel drive.

It's got a gun rack. And I use that

for hunting mostly.

DEBBIE

Why do you kill little animals? I

think that's terrible.

TERRY

Oh, well, yeah, I figure with bears,

though, it's either me or them...

You know, I think you're really neat.

DEBBIE

Wait a second.

TERRY

Oh, jeez, I'm sorry. I don't know

what got into me--I didn't mean to--

maybe it's the booze or something.

DEBBIE

There--now.

DEBBIE

Ow--you pinched me.

TERRY

I'm sorry.

DEBBIE

Let me get my head over here--okay,

now you get up--

TERRY

Ow--my leg, my leg. Ow, watch it!

DEBBIE

Ummm, I just love tuck 'n roll

upholstery.

TERRY

Geez, it's like Grand Central Station

around here. Why don't we go someplace

else.

DEBBIE

Nah, come on. They won't come back.

TERRY

Wait a minute. I got a blanket in

the back. Why don't we go over into

the field?

DEBBIE

All right. Okay.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Hello.

GIRL (V.O.)

Yeah!

WOLFMAN

How old are you?

GIRL

I'm thirteen, how old are you?

WOLFMAN

I'm only fourteen.

GIRL

Oh, boy, I love you, Wolfman.

SINGERS

(singing over)

"Wolfman Jack."

WOLFMAN

Oh, now we gonna do the weather for

all the valleys and the mountain

tops. Gonna be hot... about 200

degrees in Merced, 400 degrees out

in Fresno, and I know we're gonna

have about 500 degrees up around the

valley somewhere. You got the Wolfman

Jack Show.

CURT

Hey, terrific, I love miniature golf.

JOE

I hate it.

CURT

Well, I don't play that often really.

Ah--what're we doing here then?

JOE

We're outta gas.

CURT

They don't sell gas here.

JOE

No... but we're outta money, too.

Come on, Carl.

CURT

Curt.

JOE

All right, men.

MR. GORDON

What're you punks doing?

CURT

Hey, hi. Mr. Gordon, what's up?

MR. GORDON

Henderson--Curt Henderson? You with

these punks?

CURT

These are my friends. We were just...

MR. GORDON

Jeez, you guys had me scared.

MR. GORDON

Hey, you haven't left yet?

CURT

Oh ah--no--no, I'm not--

CURT

I mean, I'm not leaving until

tomorrow.

MR. GORDON

Tomorrow. Well, listen, Hank

Anderson's inside. Come in and say

goodbye. You know, Hank's the one

that brought your name up on the

floor of the Moose Hall. You got the

check, didn't you?

HANK

We are all proud of you, Curt. The

Moose Scholarship couldn't have gone

to a better boy. And if there's

anything we can do, let us know.

MR. GORDON

Yeah, you'll stay in touch by letter,

won't you?

JOE

Hey, we're all done out here.

MR. GORDON

All done? What--what's he mean?

CURT

Ah, he means, we're all done having

loads of fun out here.

MR. GORDON

Oh, well...

HANK

Wonderful. You can have all the fun

you want. This place is for fun.

CURT

Yes. Yes, it is. Thank you. Thank

you both.

MR. GORDON

Good luck now.

HANK

Before I say goodbye, Curt, I want

to tell you I hope you'll be taking

along with you a little piece of

this place.

CURT

I think I have.

HANK

Good. Don't forget us.

CURT

No, I won't forget you and you won't

forget me.

MR. GORDON

Okay. 'Bye.

HANK

Good-bye and good luck.

CURT

'Bye.

JOE

It was nice to meet yuh.

CURT

Right. What he said goes for me,

too.

JOE

Yeah, you just might make it as a

Pharoah yet, boy.

HANK

Some day he'll make a fine Moose.

DEBBIE

What's wrong?

TERRY

I thought I heard something.

VOICE (O.S.)

They're porking in the weeds. No

sweat.

TERRY

Wait a minute!

DEBBIE

What?

TERRY

The radio is gone... That means--the

car is gone!

TERRY

Oh no!!! OH NO!!!

TERRY

Oh God--I'm sorry. But, why the car?

You could have struck us with

lightning or something--anything---

but not the car!

LAURIE

You know, it doesn't make sense to

leave home to look for a home, to

give up a life to find a new life,

to say goodbye to friends you love

just to find new friends.

STEVE

What? Say that again, I didn't--

LAURIE

That's what Curt said.

STEVE

Oh, figures.

(smiling)

You must've talked his ear off trying

to get him to stay.

LAURIE

That's not true. I didn't say

anything. Curt just said at dinner

tonight he realized there was no big

hurry. He thought he should take it

easy for a while, go to J.C. and try

to figure out what he wants to do

with his life.

STEVE

That sounds logical.

LAURIE

You think so?

STEVE

Sure. I think Curt's probably right

for Curt. Not for me though. Laurie,

look at me. Now you know what I want

out of life. And it's just not in

this town.

LAURIE

I'm not going to the airport tomorrow.

LAURIE

Steve! Don't.

STEVE

(quietly)

It's our last night together for

three months... come on.

LAURIE

We've been through this before.

STEVE

I'm going to miss you so much. I

need something to remember you by.

You don't want me to forget you.

LAURIE

(softly)

No...

STEVE

What's wrong? You're just lying there.

LAURIE

Well go ahead, you want to.

STEVE

Not like that.

LAURIE

If you're not going to remember me

for anything else, why don't you go

ahead?

STEVE

You want it and you know it. Don't

be so damn self-righteous with me.

After those things you told me about

watching your brother--

LAURIE

You're disgusting! Get out of my

car! I told you never--

STEVE

I'm sorry.

LAURIE

Get out! It's not worth it. I don't

care if you're leaving--now get out!

DEBBIE

Anyway, the Goat Killer--

TERRY

Let's talk about something else.

DEBBIE

--Whenever he strikes, he leaves a

bloody goat's head near the victim.

Isn't that creepy?

DEBBIE

They thought he went up to Stockton,

but two nights ago they found Carlie

Johnson and Don White right here by

the canal all hacked to pieces and--

TERRY

Who do you think'll take the regionals

this--

DEBBIE

--not only were there bloody goats'

heads, but he had switched all the

parts of their bodies around. You

know putting her arms on him and his

legs on--

TERRY

Wait a second. Did you hear...?

DEBBIE

You think it's the Goat Killer?

TERRY

(whispering)

No! I mean, no. Listen, I'll go for

help, you stay here.

DEBBIE

Come on, we'll hide in the field.

DEBBIE

Maybe if it's the Goat Killer he'll

get somebody and we'll see the whole

thing.

TERRY

I don't want to see the whole thing.

Especially if it's us he--oh, why

me? I'm going to look lousy with

your legs and a goat's head and--

DEBBIE

Shhh--he's stopped. I can't see him

very--I think he's coming this way.

TERRY

Well, as long as he's not--Debbie!

Debbie!

STEVE (O.S.)

Terry!

TERRY

Who, me? Why me?

STEVE

Terry.

TERRY

Steve!

TERRY

Where'd you go, anyway?

DEBBIE

Over there.

TERRY

Well, don't go off again. Come on,

let's get out of here.

STEVE

What're you doing out here? Hey,

where's my rod?

TERRY

(choking)

Um, oh, did I introduce you? This is

Debbie. Debbie, this is Steve.

DEBBIE

Hello.

STEVE

Hi.

DEBBIE

Hi.

STEVE

Well, what about my car?

TERRY

Um... I'ts in the garage. I put it

in the garage for safe keeping. I

mean... I don't want to take any

chances with it.

STEVE

Oh, great.

DEBBIE

Yeah. Yeah. It's a good thing too.

'Cause somebody stole our car.

STEVE

Really? That's terrible. What kind

was it?

TERRY

Gee, ah, where's Laurie, anyway?

STEVE

I guess we broke up.

TERRY

You broke up? Bull!

CAROL

It doesn't look like a gear shift

knob.

JOHN

Come on, will ya? Give it back to

me.

CAROL

Well, go ahead, cream me. What's

wrong, you're a tough guy. Break my

arm, see if I care.

JOHN

Forget it.

CAROL

I was just going to keep it for a

little while. You're an ogre, just

like my father. He won't let me play

records, or stay out late, or

anything.

JOHN

(worried)

He ah--doesn't like you to stay out

late?

CAROL

No--he's terrible. Once I was at a

party that didn't end till late and

he called the cops. Can you imagine?

It was only a little after midnight

and he had the whole police force--

JOHN

Say, where do you live anyway?

CAROL

Over on Ramona, why?

(She suddenly smiles)

Oh no. Uh uh. You thought I'd tell

you where--not me, not old Carol.

The night is young and I'm not hitting

the rack until I get a little action.

CAROL

What do you keep lookin' at?

(she looks around

behind them)

Who's that? You know him? He's

following awful close.

JOHN

Grab onto something.

FALFA

(shouting over)

Sorry if I scared ya, man.

JOHN

(looking ahead)

Takes more than that to scare me.

FALFA

Where ya been hiding? Didn't anyone

tell ya I been looking for ya?

JOHN

Hey, I can't keep tracka all the

punks lookin' for me.

FALFA

They say you're the fastest thing in

the Valley. But that can't be your

car, man. That must be your mama's

car. Hell, I feel embarrassed just

getting near ya.

JOHN

Ya should, man--you're driving a

field car.

FALFA

Field car? What's a Field Car?

JOHN

Field Cars drive through the fields,

dropping cow shit all over the place

to make the lettuce grow.

FALFA

(laughing)

That's pretty good. Hey, I like that

paint job you got. What they call

that--sorta a cross between Piss

Yellow and Puke Green, ain't it?

JOHN

Yeah, well, you're car's so ugly you

must have to sneak up on the pumps

to get a tank of gas.

FALFA

Well, at least I don't have to move

over to let a funeral go by, man.

CAROL

(shouting)

Your car's uglier than I am.

CAROL

That didn't come out right...

FALFA

Come on, boy, prove it. Let's go.

JOHN

Look kid, why don't you go out and

win a few races, then come back and

see me.

CAROL

Oh, race him, you can beat him.

FALFA

Hey, that's a tough lookin' girl you

got with you, man. What're you doin'?

Trying to pick up a few extra bucks

babysitting?

(grinning at Carol)

Hey, Doll. Why don't you come on and

ride with me--in about ten years?

JOHN

Leave her out of this. This is just

between you and me.

CAROL

Wow! He's really fast, isn't he?

JOHN

Yeah. But he's stupid.

CURT

Hey--any of you guys know a blonde

in a white T-Bird?

JOE

Yeah, I seen her, what about it?

CURT

I was just wondering who she is.

JOE

She's outta your price range, man.

My brother's been with her and he

clued me in.

CURT

Price range? You mean she's a--

JOE

Yeah, Thirty Dollar Sheri. Can you

believe that? Thirty dollars.

CURT

We must be thinking of different

blondes.

CARLOS

Hey man, don't tell Joe what he

thinks.

ANTS

Thirty dollars ain't much. I saw ten

thousand once. My old man had it in

a suitcase. They caught him the next

morning though.

CARLOS

Fuzz ahead, watch it.

JOE

Where?

CARLOS

Fuzz ahead, watch it.

JOE

Where?

CARLOS

At Jerrie's Cherries. You can just

barely see the fender.

ANTS

That's rotten, man. Hiding like that.

CARLOS

That's shitty.

JOE

It's dishonest.

JOE

We oughta do something. I got an

idea. I got a good idea.

STEVE

I think I'm gonna go over to Burger

City.

TERRY

Yeah. Yeah. Laurie's probably over

there.

STEVE

You really think she's got me worried

about where she is, don't you?

TERRY

Well...

STEVE

Let me tell you something. I couldn't

care less. Want to come along?

DEBBIE

Yeah, I do. I do.

TERRY

No.

STEVE

Make up your minds.

TERRY

No, thanks. U'mm. You know we got to

report the car missing.

STEVE

All right. See yuh.

TERRY

Yeah. See yuh.

DEBBIE

Why can't we go to Burger City?

TERRY

Burger City? Burger City!!? How can

you think of hamburgers when somebody

stole my car.

JOE

Listen, ah--Carl, I--

CURT

Curt.

JOE

Curt.

JOE

Despite you scratching Gil's car, I

like you. And I know what you'd like

more than anything right now. Like

every guy in town, you got the same

secret dream, right?

JOE

Ya want to join the Pharoahs. Huh?

You can admit it--you'd like to--but

you never dreamed it could be

possible, did you?

JOE

Well, tonight, I'm goin' to give you

your chance.

JOE

Get down!

JOE

Okay. Now you got it? I'm stayin'

here. You're on your own.

CURT

Wait a minute, wait a minute, Joe.

What if he hears me?

JOE

Shhh. Listen. Look at it this way:

Now you got three choices. One, you

chicken out. In that case, I let

Ants tie you to the car and drag you

around a little bit. And you don't

want that, right?

CURT

No.

JOE

Two, you foul up and Holstein hears

you and well, ah... you don't want

that, right?

CURT

No, I don't.

JOE

Three, you are successful and you

join the Pharoahs with a carcoat,

and the blood initiation and all

that, huh?

CURT

(seeing Joe walk away)

Wait--wait a minute. Wait a minute!

What blood initiation?

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Oh, here we go baby! Here's "Come Go

With Me."

DEBBIE

Hey, why don't we go get your jeep?

TERRY

What? What are you talking about?

DEBBIE

You know, your jeep. The one you

sold the hunting ponies for. The one

with the four-wheel drive.

DEBBIE

Come on, Terry--Terry?

JOE

Hey, you sure you got enough slack?

CURT

Yeah, yeah. No sweat. Let's get out

of here.

CURT

Stand by for Justice!

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Oh, I can't believe it. Feels so

good 'cause you're sweet sixteen.

CAROL

Why are we stopping here?

JOHN

(in a husky voice)

Carol...

CAROL

What?

JOHN

I--I don't think that I can control

myself any longer.

CAROL

You can't?

JOHN

No... Carol, I've got to have you.

CAROL

Me?

JOHN

All night you've been sitting there

and you've been so sexy and it's

been so hot--and I can't wait any

more...

CAROL

Well--well, a lot of that's an act,

you know. Like... like my crying. It

was just an act.

JOHN

Well, it's been building up inside

of me like a volcano, all night.

Maybe if I knew where you lived I

could fight it--I could take you

home--but since you won't tell me,

and since here we are--I've got to

have you. It's too late--

CAROL

It's not too late! It's never too

late! 231 Ramona--two three one--

JOHN

(smiling)

Two three one--

CAROL

I'll show you! It's easy to find.

BUDDA

Hi. You mind if I sit down?

STEVE

Hi Budda. No, have a seat.

BUDDA

I got five minutes outa the rat race,

and I saw you all alone. For a change.

BUDDA

Where's Laurie?

STEVE

I don't know.

BUDDA

I thought the two of you'd be going

strong, this being your last night

and everything--

STEVE

We broke up.

STEVE

No big deal.

BUDDA

Wow... what happened?

STEVE

Nothing. We were out at the canal

and... we had a fight.

STEVE

What's so funny?

BUDDA

Nothing. Just thinking. A girl like

Laurie--I mean, she goes to school

and is cute and popular and all, but

we're not so different. We know what

we want. I've seen her after you for

two years now.

STEVE

She's not like that.

BUDDA

Maybe not. She does have a different

approach. Hers is "Never surrender,"

me I lay down my arms at the drop of

a hat--

VOICE (O.S.)

Budda, you got an hour left, let's

get on it.

BUDDA

(yelling back)

All right, relax... old fart. Listen,

I'm off in an hour. If you wanta

come over, my girlfriend's away for

the weekend.

STEVE

I don't know...

BUDDA

Why don't you? I never got a chance

to talk to you. You're leaving

tomorrow. Listen, I gave up a long

time ago, so it'd be just for fun.

No problems.

BUDDA

I'll see ya later then.

STEVE

Budda, Budda wait.

STEVE

I gotta get up early and--I just

don't think it'd work out.

BUDDA

She's got you so brainwashed--well,

hell. Some day I'm gonna win. Don't

ya think?

STEVE

Sure.

JOE

Oh mother, it's been a glorious night.

CARLOS

That was the bitchinest thing I ever

seen in my whole life.

ANTS

I seen a little kid attacked by pigs

once, but this was even better.

JOE

Oh boy, I'll tell you something,

that car must've jumped five feet in

the air!

JOE

You sure you got to go? The night's

young.

CURT

Yeah, there's some things I got to

do. I still want to find that blonde.

JOE

I think she was an optical delusion,

man. Psychology-wise it ain't good

to dwell on it. You'll alter your

ego or something. Anyway, catch ya

tomorrow night?

CURT

Yeah, I guess so.

JOE

Guess so? Man, we don't admit a lot

of guys to the Pharoahs. You

understand we're going to have to

swipe your jacket and all--you gotta

make up your mind.

CURT

Hey--I'll see you guys.

JOE

Sure--listen, remember, Rome wasn't

buried in a night.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

My, my, my. You only got five minutes

left, if you want to talk to the

Wolfman. Gonna make all your dreams

come true, baby.

VOICE (V.O.)

Wolfman...

WOLFMAN

Yeah.

VOICE

Would you dedicate a record to keep

me and my girlfriend together?

WOLFMAN

Are you separated?

VOICE

Well, see, we're havin' a little

problem.

WOLFMAN

I'll bring you right together. Hold

on a minute, man. Hi ya, hi ya, hi,

hi, hi. Everything's gonna be all

right now, man, you understand? Now,

let me play the record for you.

FALFA

Hey Hey Hey, baby, what do you say?

LAURIE

Just don't say anything and we'll

get along fine.

JOHN

This the first time you've been quiet

all night.

CAROL

I had fun. Goodbye.

CAROL

Do you like me?

JOHN

Yeah. I like you. You're all right.

CAROL

But I mean, do you like me?

JOHN

I, ah... I like you. Okay?

CAROL

Couldn't I have something to remember

you by?

JOHN

'Bye, kid.

CAROL

Gee, thanks. It's just like a ring

or something.

JOHN

Yeah.

CAROL

It's like we were going steady.

Wait'll I tell Marcia.

JOHN

Wait a minute, now.

CAROL

Wait'll I tell everybody.

JOHN

Don't go overboard with this thing.

CAROL

Well, I'll see you around.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

I haven't cried so much. And the

tears and everything, man... I leaned

down towards the microphone and I

almost shorted myself out.

CURT

Hold that up.

STEVE

(taking the hood from

him)

I've been thinking--maybe you're

right. Why should I leave home to

find a new home. Why should I leave

friends that I love to find new

friends?

CURT

Wait a minute, wait a minute. I've

heard this already. Aren't you the

one who for eight weeks has been

telling me you have to leave the

nest sometime?

STEVE

I realize that. I realize--

CURT

No--no realizing. You've been telling

me all summer that it's time to pull

your head out of the sand and take a

look at the big, beautiful world out

there. Gimme this thing.

STEVE

(letting him close

the hood)

I don't know--I--

CURT

(banging the Citroen

hood shut)

I feel like a mid-wife.

STEVE

I guess I was wrong. I may have been

wrong.

CURT

Wrong nothing. You've been talking

about getting out of this town for

eight weeks. And now--goddamnit!--

you're just--you're just mentally

playing with yourself. If you can

just relax, we'll talk about it at

the airport.

STEVE

Where are you going? It's awfully

early in the morning.

CURT

I have a dental appointment.

STEVE

Come on, Curt...

CURT

Just relax, wil ya? I'll see you at

the airport.

GUY

I never seen a guy lose so much. He

mustn't have been used to drinking.

DEBBIE

Oh no, he really likes to drink. He

told me.

OLD MAN

Gettin' late... I knew a man once

who got this sick. Billy Webber.

That was ten years ago. What do you

think that was there, that he had

for dinner?

OLD WOMAN

Staying on his hands and knees like

that...

(she grins)

He looks like a dog, doesn't he?

Looks like old Ginger.

OLD MAN

Sicker than a dog, that's for sure.

TERRY

Ohh rats, I feel like--

(he notices a car

nearby and pushes

himself up)

Wait a second... hey!

TERRY

It's--oh my god--it looks like Steve's

car. Look, right here under our--

it's my car. My car. We found it.

Look!

DEBBIE

Maybe we oughta call the police.

TERRY

Never get here in time. I got a better

idea. We'll just steal it back. See

if you can find some wire around. We

only need a foot to hot-wire it...

okay?

ATTENDANT

Took the header plugs off. Expectin'

some action?

JOHN

Yeah. Think so. There's some punk

lookin' for me.

ATTENDANT

Why the hell do they bother? You've

been number one as long as I can

remember.

JOHN

Yeah... it's been a long time, ain't

it? I'll see ya. Thanks.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Who is this on the Wolfman telephone?

BIG BOPPER (V.O.)

Hellooo, baaaby--

TERRY

Ah, hi--this is my car. What I mean

is, somebody stole my car--I mean I

lost my car and I want to thank you

two guys for--

TERRY

--for returning--I mean finding it.

I mean, listen now, listen guys--

I've been sick recently, and this

kind of activity can really be hard

on a guy. Now, easy will you? Easy!

DEBBIE

Stop it, stop it, stop it! Help!

Police! You creeps!

TERRY

Go, John!

DEBBIE

Hit him!

JOHN

Hey, man, you all right?

TERRY

Yeah. I'll die soon and it'll all be

over.

DEBBIE

(looking at John)

Wow--you're just like the Lone Ranger.

JOHN

(eyeing Debbie)

Yeah. Listen, are you with the Toad,

or were you with them?

TERRY

You're talking to the woman I love...

JOHN

What happened, man?

STEVE

Hi, Karen, Judy.

JUDY

Hi, Steve. Have you seen Laurie

lately?

JUDY

Well, we have.

STEVE

(already annoyed)

Oh yeah. So what?

JUDY

So nothing. She was just with a really

cute guy in a boss car. We wondered

who he was.

STEVE

I wouldn't know.

JUDY

We do. His name's Bob Falfa.

TERRY

Help... I mean, I want two cherry

cokes with lots of ice. Never mind,

forget the cokes, just bring the

ice, pronto.

STEVE

Out! OUT!

TERRY

What??

STEVE

I need the car--now.

TERRY

What's going on?

STEVE

I'm about to find out.

DEBBIE

I don't believe it! You practically

get killed trying to get your car

back, then you let him have it.

TERRY

It's not my car.

DEBBIE

What?

TERRY

What?

TERRY

IT IS NOT MY CAR!

DEBBIE

Well, where is your car?

TERRY

I DON'T HAVE A CAR!

DEBBIE

You don't--no car at all. What about

your jeep?

DEBBIE

No car... well, how am I going to

get home?

CAR HOP

Where's your car? I gotta hook 'em

to your car.

JOHN

What's wrong, Toad? You lose the car

again?

TERRY

(softly)

No... Steve took it.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

It's a shame, Baby. I'll tell yuh...

Got to take it easy when you're

drivin' that car of yours. You got

to cruise easy, baby. Don't be doin'

any accidents or anything on me.

DEBBIE

You know, I had a pretty good time

tonight.

TERRY

Oh come on, you're just--

DEBBIE

No, no, really. I really had a good

time. I mean, you picked me up and

we got some hard stuff and saw a

hold-up, and then we went to the

Canal, you got your car stolen, and

then I got to watch you gettin' sick,

and then you got in this really

bitchin' fight... I really had a

good time.

TERRY

You think so? Yeah--well I guess I

have pretty much fun every night.

DEBBIE

Anyway if you're not doing anything

tomorrow night, why don't you come

over?

TERRY

Yeah--well, I might be busy, you

know. But we could--well, I got a

little Vespa I just play around with.

DEBBIE

Really? Why that's almost a

motorcycle. And I just love

motorcycles.

DEBBIE

I got to go.

TERRY

Ow.

DEBBIE

Goodnight.

TERRY

See ya.

VOICE (V.O.)

Yeah, who is it?

CURT

It's--I want to talk to the Wolfman.

VOICE

The Wolfman ain't here.

CURT

I know, but I got to get in touch

with him. I got something to give

him before--

VOICE

We don't take no deliveries after

eight. Come back tomorrow.

CURT

No, I can't. I want to ask him

something that--

VOICE

Dedications by phone is Diamond 75044.

Wolfman Top 40 is Box 13, Chula Vista.

Wolfman Sweatshirts is Wolf

Enterprises, Bakersfield. 'Bye.

CURT

Listen, I got a right to talk to

him. I listened to him every night

for as long--for twelve years almost.

I know him and it's personal and

it'll only take a minute and I bet

Wolfman would be upset if he knew a

friend couldn't get in touch with--

MANAGER

What do you want?

MANAGER

Pull the red switch.

CURT

I'm looking for a girl.

MANAGER

Aren't we all. She ain't here. Come

on back to the booth.

MANAGER

Hey, have a popsicle. The ice box

just broke down and they're meltin'

all over the place. You want one?

CURT

No. Thanks. Listen, ah...

MANAGER

Have a popsicle.

CURT

Are you the Wolfman?

MANAGER

No, man. I'm not the Wolfman.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Who is this on the Wolfman's

telephone?

DIANE (V.O.)

Diane.

WOLFMAN

How're you doin', Diane?

DIANE

All right.

MANAGER

That's the Wolfman.

CURT

He's on tape. The man is on tape.

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Do you love me? Say you love me,

Diane.

CURT

Well, ah--where does he work? I mean,

where is the Wolfman now?

MANAGER

The Wolfman is everywhere.

CURT

But I got to give him this note.

MANAGER

(taking it from Curt)

Here, let me see the note.

(he reads it)

Hell, that's just a dedication. All

I gotta do is relay it. And it'll be

on the air tomorrow, or Tuesday at

the latest.

CURT

No, no. See, this is very important.

I may be leaving town tomorrow, and

it's very important that I--damn it,

that I reach this girl right now.

MANAGER

You don't know whether you're gonna

leave town or not?

CURT

Well, I'm supposed to go to college

back East tomorrow. And I don't know

if I'm gonna go.

MANAGER

Wait a minute. Have a popsicle.

CURT

No, thank you.

MANAGER

Sit down a minute.

MANAGER

Listen, it's early in the morning.

Now, I can't really talk for the

Wolfman. But I think if he was here

he'd tell you to get your ass in

gear. Now, no offense to your home

town here, but this place ain't

exactly the hub of the universe, if

you know what I mean. And well--I'll

tell you this much--the Wolfman does

come in here now and then, with tapes,

to check up on me, you know, and

when I hear the stories he got about

the places he goes. Hell, here I sit

while there's a big beautiful world

out there, don't ya know. Wolfman

comes in last time talking about

some exotic jungle country, handing

me cigars he says was rolled on the

naked thighs of brown beauties. The

Wolfman been everywhere and he seen

everything. He got so many stories,

so many memories. And here I sit

sucking on popsicles.

CURT

Why don't you leave?

MANAGER

Well, I'm no kid anymore. I been

here a long time. And the Wolfman--

well, the Wolfman gave me my start

and he's sorta become my life. I

can't leave him now. Gotta be loyal

to the Wolfman, you understand.

MANAGER

I tell you what. If I can possibly

do it tonight, I'll try to relay

this dedication and get it on the

air for you later on.

CURT

That'd be great. Thanks. Really.

MANAGER

Sorry, sticky little mothers ain't

they? Bye.

CURT

'Bye.

CURT

Wolfman...

TERRY

Hey, John, let me go with you. Come

on.

JOHN

Naw, man. I can't take you when I'm

racin' somebody.

TERRY

Ah, come on. Just let me go. So I

can watch. Or, I'll flag you, okay?

JOHN

All right. Go ahead.

JOHN

Paradise Road.

FALFA

All right now, where's this Paradise

Road?

LAURIE

You just follow this street straight

out of town... Listen, if you're

gonna race John Milner, you can let

me out right when we get there.

FALFA

Why don't you shut up, baby? You

ain't said one word all night long.

What a weird broad. But you're gonna

appreciate me soon. You're gonna be

hangin' on for mercy, when I get

this sucker rollin'.

DALE

You heading out to Paradise Road?

STEVE

Paradise Road, I'm not--

DALE

Some guy named Falfa going up against

Milner.

STEVE

John's racing Falfa?

DALE

Yeah. Figured something was up, saw

them going out of town real cautious

and then--

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

I got a dedication here that's for a

friend of the Wolfman--a special

friend of the Wolfman who's leaving

town tomorrow and wants me to play

the next song for a blonde young

lady in a Thunderbird. A white T-

Bird, you understand? Now my friend's

named Curt and he wants to talk to

you out there, baby. So you meet him

at Burger City, or phone Diamond

3132. Now he's a friend of mine, you

hear, and, little girl, you better

call him, or the Wolfman gonna get

you.

JOHN

Hey--Laurie, what in the hell are

you doing in there? Is she gonna

ride with you?

LAURIE

Mind your own business, John.

FALFA

Yeah, she's with me. You worry about

yourself, man.

TERRY

Everybody ready?

STEVE

You stupid sonofabitch, she was in

that car! Why did you have--

LAURIE

I said I didn't--you lousy greasy

jerk! You coulda killed me--what's

wrong with you. You clubfoot...

LAURIE

No, no, no. Please, don't come near

me. No, please. I think I'm gonna be

sick. Oh, Steven.

STEVE

Laurie, please.

LAURIE

Oh, Steven! Oh, Steven, please, don't

leave me. Don't leave me, Steven.

STEVE

I won't.

LAURIE

I couldn't bear it.

STEVE

I won't.

LAURIE

Please.

STEVE

Believe me.

JOHN

Come on, before she blows.

TERRY

Jeez, did you show him! He'll probably

never even get in a car again.

JOHN

He was faster.

TERRY

It was beautiful, John. Just beauti--

what?

JOHN

I was losin', man.

TERRY

What?

JOHN

He had me, man. He was pullin' away

from me just before he crashed.

TERRY

You're crazy.

JOHN

You saw it.

TERRY

No, you creamed him, from right off

the line. The guy never had a chance.

JOHN

Shit, Toad. The man had me. He was

beating me.

TERRY

John, I don't know what you're talking

about. It was the most beautiful

thing I've ever seen. That guy, he

might as well get a wheelchair and

roll himself home. Man, you got...

you got the bitchinist car in the

Valley. You'll always be number one,

John. You're the greatest.

JOHN

Look at your glasses, man.

(shaking his head)

Okay, Toad. We'll take 'em all.

TERRY

(grinning)

Right.

JOHN

We'll take em... let's get out of

here.

TERRY

Jesus, what a night.

CURT

Hello, hello, hello!

VOICE (V.O.)

Curt?

CURT

Yeah... this is Curt, who is this?

VOICE

Who were you expecting?

CURT

Do you drive a white T-Bird?

VOICE

A white '56. I saw you on Third

Street.

CURT

You know me.

VOICE

Of course!

CURT

Who are you? How do you know me?

VOICE

It's not important.

CURT

(excitedly)

It's important to me. You're the

most perfect, beautiful creature

I've ever seen and I don't know

anything about you. Could we meet

someplace?

VOICE

I cruise Third Street every night.

Maybe I'll see you again tonight.

CURT

No... I don't think so.

VOICE

Why?

CURT

I'm leaving... in a couple of hours.

Where are you from?

VOICE

Curt...

CURT

What's your name? At least tell me

your name?

VOICE

Goodbye, Curt.

CURT

Wait a second! Wait a second!

WOLFMAN (V.O.)

Little kiss on your ear. Good night,

sweetheart. I'll see you later.

STEVE

Good luck.

CURT

Yeah, same to you. And I better see

you there next year.

STEVE

Oh yeah, I'll be there.

CURT

Sure.

CURT

See ya later.

LAURIE

'Bye 'bye, Curt.

CURT

So long, guys.

TERRY

Well, stay cool, man.

CURT

Yeah.

TERRY

Ah--don't do anything I wouldn't do.

CURT

I'll see ya, buddy.

JOHN

I know, you probably think you're a

big shot, goin' off like this--but

you're still a punk.

CURT

Okay, John. So long.

THE END
