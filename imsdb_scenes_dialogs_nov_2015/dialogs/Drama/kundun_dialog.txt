One night, you stopped all

your moving, and I said to your

sister, "His time has come."

LHAMO

Me.  First break of day.

MOTHER

At dawn, you were born. One eye was

closed, and your sister opened it

with her thumb.  We gave you the

sweet drink.

LHAMO

I pooped.

MOTHER

You did.  We washed you and wrapped

you in sheepskin and took you to your

For all sick beings in the world,

until everyone is healed."

CHINESE GOVERNOR

KEUSTANG RINPOCHE

This is Tibet. We are not

under your authority.

CHINESE GOVERNOR

But why?  Who is Lhamo?

Who do they say he is?

BOYS (reciting)

For all who wish to cross the water."

The Wish Fulfilling Jewel.

The Fourteenth Dalai Lama.

RETING RINPOCHE

Long life.

MOTHER

Long life.

FATHER

Long life.

LOBSANG

Long life, Lhamo.

MONKS

Kundun!  Kundun!

RETING RINPOCHE

Centuries ago, a young boy was

born.  His name was Gedundrub.

The night of his birth, robbers

came to his home and his family

fled hiding the baby in a cattle

pen. When they returned the next

day, the baby was safe. They found

him guarded by a pair of black crows.

He was the first Dalai Lama.

The Living Buddha of Compassion.

Now, you have chosen to come back to

this life once again.

RETING RINPOCHE

We name you Tenzin Gyatso.

RETING RINPOCHE

Your job is simple.

You are to love all living things.

Just love them.  Care for them.

Have compassion for them.

"As long as any living thing draws

breath, wherever he shall be, there

in compassion, shall the Buddha

appear, incarnate."

RETING RINPOCHE

You will be the leader of

the Tibetan people when you come of

age.  Until that time, I will be

your teacher, and as your Regent,

I will rule in your name.

I will tell your Lord

Chamberlain you are ready to

see him.

RETING RINPOCHE

He will see you now.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Fifth Dalai Lama.

LORD CHAMBBERLAIN

Seventh Dalai Lama.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Thirteenth Dalai Lama.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Fourteenth Dalai Lama.

TENZIN GYATSO (OC)

I am the good one. You be bad.

The bad man.

NORBU THUNDRUP

My name is Norbu,

Holiness.  I will be good,

you be bad.

TENZIN GYATSO

I'm on a big mountain

and hitting at the bad men.

And after the game, we're going

to trade.  You just stay

over there, no, there!, Norbu,

and I will shoot at you.

I want your land.  I take it.

I am stronger.

NORBU THUNDRUP

I am braver.

TENZIN GYATSO

I have more men.

NORBU ThUNDRUP

I have smarter men.

NORBU THUNDRUP

Today you lose.  Tomorrow you

may win.

NORBU THUNDRUP

Things change, Kundun.

TENZIN GYATSO

Why is your beard so funny?

Let me touch this.

TENZIN GYATSO

Soft.

TENZIN GYATSO

"As long as all living draw

breaths, there Buddha is."

LAYMAN

I believe that the Regent is asking

for too high a reward for his part in

finding the Dalai Lama.  Too much

money, too much land.

LAYMAN

Our treasuries are empty.  Our army

is depleted.  He would have us pull

the hair from our noses.

MONK

We note this.  Now, the Chinese.

MONK

The Allies wish to build a supply-

road from India, crossing Tibet, as

part of their war effort.  The road

would lead directly to China.

LAYMAN

We cannot allow it.

Right now, we have a only a small

Chinese mission in Lhasa, the first

since the Thirteenth Dalai Lama

threw them out in 1912.

The road would increase the size of

that mission. The Chinese would

try to control our trade, as they did

once before, control our contact

with the outside world.

MONKS (OC)

Kundun!  Kundun!

TENZIN GYATSO

What is it?

THE ATTENDANTS

Ah, it is a telescope, Holiness.

With this you can see a long way.

TENZIN GYATSO

And, is it mine?

ATTENDANT

These are all gifts sent to

your predecessors.

LOBSANG SAMTEN

Yes!  Then it is yours!

TENZIN GYATSO

I need it.

NORBU THUNDRUP (OC)

One night, not too long

ago, an old monk saw a woman in that

very same hallway where you ran away.

NORBU THUNDRUP

She carried a basket in

her arms, a big, heavy basket, and

the old monk cautiously approached.

She opened her basket and showed what

she had.  Heads.  Human heads. Only

the heads.

TENZIN GYATSO

Is that true or pretend?

NORBU THUNDRUP

It is a story, you decide.

TENZIN GYATSO

Pretend.

NORBU THUNDRUP

As you say.

TENZIN GYATSO

"I be an island for those who

seek one, a lamp for light."

TENZIN GYATSO (VO)

"May I be a bed for all who wish

to rest,

and a slave for all who want a

slave."

TENZIN GYATSO

"May I be wishing jewel, a magic

vase...

TENZIN GYATSO

I want to go down there.

NORBU THUNDRUP

You can only go with attendants and a

big ceremony.

TENZIN GYATSO

I want to run down the street.

I want to buy a toy.  Eat from

the shops.

NORBU THUNDRUP

You cannot.

TENZIN GYATSO

I want to be a shepherd, taking those

goats and cows out to the hillside.

NORBU THUNDRUP

But you are not a shepherd, you are

the Dalai Lama.

TENZIN GYATSO

Maybe in the next life, the

world will not need a Dalai Lama.

NORNU ThUNDRUP

I would not know.  Maybe.

TENZIN GYATSO

Little ones first, only

little ones.

LOBSANG SAMTEN

The Dalai Lama is not supposed

to eat pork.  It is not good for

your brain.

FATHER

I am sorry, Lhamo.

TENZIN GYATSO

It is alright, Father.

MASTER OF THE ROBE

Kundun, you must come back now.

TENZIN GYATSO

Go away.

FATHER

Not the way to talk to people.

TENZIN GYATSO

Can I do anything I want?

FATHER

No.

TENZIN GYATSO

But, I am in charge.

FATHER

Are you?  Of whom?

TENZIN GYATSO

Can I save the sheep from going

to the market?  So they don't die.

LOBSANG

You could buy them.

TENZIN GYATSO

Do I have money?

LOBSANG

What do you think?

TENZIN GYATSO

Do you have money?

FATHER

I do, now.

TENZIN GYATSO

And you have horses?

You love horses.

FATHER

I do, beautiful horses.

Thank you, Holiness.

TENZIN GYATSO

Will you buy the sheep for me?

FATHER

Where will you keep them?

TENZIN GYATSO

Here.  We'll collect them.

FATHER

I will buy them for you.

TENZIN GYATSO

Can I free the prisoners?

FATHER

Hmmm.

LOBSANG

You can't do anything real

until you are Dalai Lama.

TENZIN GYATSO

I am him.

LOBSANG

Not until you are eighteen.

MOTHER (OC)

You have escaped once more.

LOBSANG

Go study.  I get in trouble if you

do not study.

LOBSANG

I do.

FATHER

Sometimes you strike the goat,

to scare the sheep.

LOBSANG

I am the goat.

He is a naughty sheep.

FATHER

He will not be ours much longer.

MOTHER

I have news.  The Regent

has resigned his post.

TENZIN GYATSO

Is he a bad man?  Norbu says

he is "lavish" and "willful".

"How can he give you monk's vows

if he has not kept them

himself?"

MOTHER

Well, some say.

It's not for you to worry about.

Another will be chosen.

TENZIN GYATSO

He was always nice to me.

He found me.  He saw me in

his dreams.

MOTHER

I turn you over again, today,

Lhamo.  One day, you will not

be able to come running to us.

TENZIN GYATSO

But you will always be here?

MOTHER

Me?

TENZIN GYATSO

You will always!

MOTHER

I have one more piece of

news.  A baby is coming.

TENZIN GYATSO

Oh, Mama!  Who will it be?

MOTHER

Oh, no!  Who can it be?

DAY

TENZIN GYATSO

My teeth!  My teeth are in here!

TENZIN GYATSO

My old teeth!

TAKTRA RINPOCHE

"I take refuge in the three jewels,

The Buddha, the Dharma and

the Sangra."

TENZIN GYATSO

You recite!

You recite!

TAKTRA RINPOCHE

"I take refuge in the three jewels,

The Buddha, the Dharma and the

Sangra."

TAKTRA RINPOCHE

"Until I attain enlightenment."

TENZIN GYATSO

I would like you to be my new

Regent.

TENZIN GYATSO (reciting)

"As long as any living thing draws

breath, wherever he shall be, there,

in compassion, shall the Buddha

appear, incarnate."

LING RINPOCHE

The Four Noble Truths.

TENZIN GYATSO

The Four Noble Truths, as

taught by the Lord

Sakyamuni Buddha are:

The Truth of Suffering

The Truth of the Cause of

Suffering, The Truth of the

Cessation of Suffering,

the Truth of the Way which

leads to the cessation of Suffering.

LING RINPOCHE

I accept it.

What is suffering?

TENZIN GYATSO

True suffering arises

from contaminated actions

and afflictions.  Birth,

illness, grief, old age,

poverty, pain, death - these

are surferings.

LING RINPOCHE

I accept it.

What are the causes of suffering?

TENZIN GYATSO

The causes of suffering arise from

true sources.  Attachment,

desire, envy, hatred, greed,

unkindness, wrong view and so forth -

these are some causes of suffering.

LING RINPOCHE

How does one progress from

the realization of one Noble Truth to

another?

(clap)

TENZIN GYATSO

We will have to think about that.

TENZIN GYATSO

I need to squeeze this brain.

LING RINPOCHE

Answer.

(clap)

TENZIN GYATSO

When one understands that

he causes some of his own suffering,

needlessly, then he looks for

the causes in his own life.

And when and he looks for those

causes, when he investigates,

then he is putting confidence

in his own ability to eliminate

the sources and end the suffering.

A wish to find a path to peace

arises. For all beings desire

happiness.  All wish to find

their purest selves.

LING RINPOCHE

I accept it.

TAKTRA RINPOCHE

Careful!  Careful!

TENZIN GYATSO

I need to jump!

I love to jump!

ORACLE

Heed the warning of your predecessor.

Or the war will end here.

TENZIN GYATSO

Oh, nicely done, Norbu.  I will

get you.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

May I listen to the news with you,

Holiness?

TENZIN GYATSO

Please.

TENZIN GYATSO

How big is Tibet's army?

LORD CPIAMBERLAIN

Roughly five thousand men.

TENZIN GYATSO

Is that big?

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

No.  Not very big.

TENZIN GYATSO

The Regent is adding men.

And he bought rifles

and ammunition from India.

Mountain guns, too.

TENZIN GYATSO

Will we be in this war?

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

No.  This war is almost over.

TENZIN GYATSO

Will we ever be in war?

NORBU THUNDRUP

We have enemies.

TENZIN GYATSO

The Chinese.

NORBU THUNDRUP

Yes.

TENZIN GYATSO

But, surely, we are safe in Tibet.

We don't believe in killing.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

No, we don't.

TENZIN GYATSO

This is Britain.

NORBU THUNDRUP

Ahh.

TENZIN GYATSO

Where is Poland?

TENZIN GYATSO

Where is Pearl Harbor?

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

In the Pacific Ocean.  It is an

island.  American territory.

TENZIN GYATSO

Where is Alsace?

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

I do not know, Holiness.

TENZIN GYATSO

This is Tibet.

And this is China.

NORBU THUNDRUP

Ahh.

TENZIN GYATSO

Certainly, we are safe in Tibet.

NORBU THUNDRUP

We hope, Kundun.

TENZIN GYATSO

What was the warning of the

Thirteenth Dalai Lama?

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

He warned about the future of

Tibet.

TENZIN GYATSO

Tell me.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

When it is time.

TENZIN GYATSO

Patience is the first of the Six

Perfections.

TENZIN GYATSO

One day, we will get that automobile

running.

LING RINPOCHE

"To be born in a time when the

Buddha has appeared.

To be born in a time when the

Buddha has taught.

To be born when the teaching of

Buddha is alive."

LING RINPOCHE

"To be born where the dharma is

practiced.

To be born in a time when people have

compassion for other people."

QUESTIONER

How is human life precious?

LING RINPOCHE

As a result of previous karma,

you have obtained this human life.

By means of this rebirth, through

work and study, you can attain all

everlasting happiness.

In the words of Shantideva:

"With the boat of this precious life,

You can cross the waters of Samsara.

How rare to find this boat!"

"Oh, ignorant one, do not fall

asleep now!"

VOICES

Sera, Sera Monastery.

Reting.  Under arrest.  The

army is taking him right past Sera!

Monastery!  Those crazy monks!  Have

been threatening trouble.

Reting tried to assassinate

Taktra Rinpoche.

TENZIN GYATSO

It's the army, firing on

Sera Monastery!

Oh, no!  Oh, no!

TENZIN GYATSO

Why is this?  What is happening?

Tell me!

NORBU THUNDRUP

Reting Rinpoche has been

arrested.  He tried to

overthrow Regent Taktra.

Today, he is brought back

to Lhasa by government officials.

The monks at Sera Monastery

have been on his side.  Now,

there is trouble between them

and the army.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

I am sorry for you to have to

witness this, Kundun.

TENZIN GYATSO

Look here!

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Tragic.  Unnecessary.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Holiness?

I have a letter.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

The Thirteenth Dalai Lama's warning.

He wrote to you, the year before he

died.  The year before you were born.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

"It may happen, that here

in Tibet, religion and

government will be attacked

both from without and within.

Unless we guard our own country..."

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

"...it will now happen that

the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, the

Father and the Son, and all

the revered holders of the faith,

will disappear and become

nameless."

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

"Monks and their monasteries will be

destroyed.

The rule of law will be weakened.

The lands and properties will be

seized.  They themselves will

be forced to serve their enemies

or wander the country like

beggars."

"All beings will be sunk

in great hardship and overwhelming

fear; the days and nights will

drag on slowly in suffering."

TENZIN GYATSO

What can I do?  I am only

a boy.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

You are the man who wrote this

letter.  You are the man who has come

back to lead us.   You will soon have

great responsibilities.  You must

know what to do.

NORBU THUNDRUP

You remember who you are.

You called for them.

TENZIN GYATSO

Taktra Rinpoche, I understand

there was an attempt on your

life.

TAKTRA RINPOCHE

It is possible, Holiness.

TENZIN GYATSO

You are unharmed?

TAKTRA RINPOCHE

Completely.

TENZIN GYATSO

Good.  Where is Reting Rinpoche now?

KASHAG MEMBER

He has been imprisoned, here in the

Potala, Holiness.

TENZIN GYATSO

The Sera monks have surrendered?

KASHAG MEMBER

It is calm.

TENZIN GYATSO

Please, have tea.

TENZIN GYATSO

I need to know what you

know.  I am no longer a child.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Ask whatever you will.

TENZIN GYATSO

What is the danger from the

Chinese, now?

KASHAG MEMBER

Very complicated, Holiness.

Let me tell you current news.

The Chinese have launched a deceptive

campaign aimed at convincing the

world that Tibet belongs to China.

We sent a mission to the Chinese

National Conference.  Our attendance

was a grave mistake.  The Tibetans

were introduced as delegates from the

"Chinese region of Tibet".

We protested this reference and

demanded a letter rebutting it.

TENZIN GYATSO

Did you receive the letter?

KASHAG MEMBER

We did not.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

The war is over.

This is a time in when nations are

redefining themselves.

TENZIN GYATSO

So, Tibet, too, needs to define

itself.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Yes.  As a free country.

But our attempts have proven

futile.  We continue to be

badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.

TENZIN GYATSO

Can India help us?

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

India is a newly independent

nation.  They are struggling.

India is in no position

to help us.

TENZIN GYATSO

Britain?

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Britain chooses not to.

TENZIN GYATSO

And, America?

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

America, we shall see.

TENZIN GYATSO

Ask the Chinese mission to leave

our country.  Immediately.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Quite simple.  Yes.  Good.

TENZIN GYATSO

I shall send a letter to America,

to the President, informing him of

our problem.

TENZIN GYATSO

I want Reting Rinpoche well cared

for.  He is my teacher.  He found me.

TENZIN GYATSO

Listen to this, Norbu.

(he reads):

To

Mr Truman

The President of the United States of America

I am glad that you are enjoying the best of health and

doing good service to uplift the happiness and

prosperity of the whole world.  Here, I am well and

doing my best for the religion of Lord Buddha and

welfare of all beings.

This is all, so far.

NORBU THUNDRUP

Reting Rinpoche has died in prison.

LAYMAN

The Communist have control of

China.

LAYMAN

Now, as his great army, stands idle

on our borders, Chairman Mao has

presented Tibet with three demands:

One, Tibet must accept that

it is part of China.

LAYMAN (OC)

Two, Tibet's defenses must

be handled by China.

Three, all political and trade

matters concerning foreign countries

must be conducted through China.

VOICE IN BACK OF ROOM (OC)

Give the Dalai Lama his majority!

MONK

We can concede that Tibet is a part

of China if we can guarantee that

the Dalai Lama's name and authority

will remain...

LAYMAN

And do you believe that the Tibetan

government will be allowed to

continue to function as it is?

Do you believe that our religion

will be protected?

VOICES

Give the Dalai Lama his majority!

MONK

We have dealt with this Chinese

obsession for hundreds of years.

We can deal with it now.

LAYMAN

These are not the Chinese we know.

These are Communists.

VOICES

Make him Dalai Lama now!

TENZIN GYATSO

If we agree that we are part of

China, nothing else will matter.

Not trade, not defense. We will be

lost.

TAKTRA RINPOCHE

What would you do, Holiness?

TENZIN GYATSO

What should I do about my doubt,

Teacher?

TAKTRA RINPOCHE

It is a difficult situation.

TENZIN GYATSO

I mean, my doubt.  Why me?

Am I Him?

TAKTRA RINPOCHE

Doubt is an affliction.  Reliquish

it.  Accept.

TENZIN GYATSO

I believe we must make no concesions

to the Chinese.  But, I am one voice.

The Dalai Lama has always trusted in

the forces of Buddha.  Let us consult

the protective deities.

BODYGUARD (shouting)

We will buy them!  We will buy them!

TAKTRA RINPOCHE

We should not accept any conditions

from the Chinese.

TAKTRA RINPOCHE (OC)

Enter.

REGENT (OC)

Summon the Lord Chamberlain and

the Kashag.

TENZIN GYATSO

Enter.

REGENT TAKTRA

Holiness.

TENZIN GYATSO

Yes.

REGENT TAKTRA

The Chinese have invaded.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

They crossed the river, Holiness.

They have invaded in six locations,

Chando Province, Kham, eastern Tibet.

TENZIN GYATSO

What is the size of our army, now?

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Eight thousand, five hundred,

soldiers and officers.

We have recently requested mortars,

anti-aircraft guns and ammunition

from India.  We have several hundred

in the area.

TENZIN GYATSO

Has anyone died?

LORD CHMBERLAIN

The radio contact said one

officer had died.  Then he

said, "The Chinese soldiers -

they are coming."

And then, the radio went dead.

TENZIN GYATSO

One man.  A man has died.

One man is too many.

ACTOR IN MOVIE

"Heavy lies the head, that

wears the crown."

RADIO

"This week, the People's

Liberation Army crossed the Drichu

River east of Chamdo and began

the peaceful liberation

of Tibet.

Tibet is in the hands of

imperialist enemies of

the people.  The Dalai

Lama, a foolish reminder

of an illiterate past,

is the figure head of

this autonomous region

of China.  Accept our

help, Tibet!  The people

shall be free!"

TENZIN GYATSO

What do the people say, Norbu?

NORBU THUNDRUP

Tibetan officials have retreated from

Chamdo.  They are scared and

running.  The Chinese strategy has

destroyed the heart of our defense

forces.  Chamdo falls, several other

villages are lost.  You know what

happens.  The road to Lhasa will be

wide open.

NORBU THUNDRUP

The people want you made Dalai Lama.

TENZIN GYATSO

Then, I am lucky.

I am still too young.

NORBU THUNDRUP

These are dangerous times.

They want the Dalai Lama to lead

them.

TENZIN GYATSO

But, I have no experience.

NORBU THUNDRUP

Oh, but you do, Kundun.

Who else would be here?

ORACLE

"His time has come."

TENZIN GYATSO

"To the members of the United

Nations:

The attention of the world is

riveted on Korea where aggression

is being resisted by an international

force.  Similar happenings in remote

Tibet are passing without notice.

The problem is not of Tibet's

own making but is largely the outcome

of unthwarted Chinese ambition

to bring weaker nations on her

periphery within her active

domination."

This is very good.  Quite strong.

TENZIN GYATSO

"Tibetans have for long lived a

cloistered life in their mountain

fastness, remote and aloof..."

TAKSTER RINPOCHE

I was never alone.  Two Chinese

were with me every minute of the day.

TAKSTER RINPOCHE

Their talk is always of liberation

and helpfulness.  They put their

words like honey on a knife, but if

you lick the honey, you will bleed.

TENZIN GYATSO

Tell me.

TAKSTER RINPOCHE

They think they have convinced me.

They think I am on their side.

They have allowed me to leave Kumbum

and come to Lhasa believing that I

will try to turn you to their ways.

If I do not succeed, I am to

eliminate you.

TENZIN GYATSO

You, kill me?

TAKSTER RINPOCHE

Eliminate you.

TARSTER RINPOCHE

I can be Governor of Lhasa,

they say.

TAKSTER RINPOCHE

Don't eat all those sweets.

You'll get sick.

TENZIN GYATSO

Do you remember the day I came to

your monastery, when I was a baby?

And you comforted me?

TAKSTER RINPOCHE

I do.

TENZIN GYATSO

I remember, too, actually.

I was frightened then.

I am frightened now.

TAKSTER RINPOCHE

The Chinese have one goal.  The

complete dissolution of our nation.

The destruction of our culture.

There is no room for Buddha in

their world.

Our only hope is to fight.

TENZIN GYATSO

We cannot.

TAKSTER RINPOCHE

This is not a fight to put

bread just in one's own mouth.

This is a fight for Tibet.

TENZIN GYATSO

Buddha teaches that we must learn

from our enemy.  We have compassion

for all people.

TAKSTER RINPOCHE

These are not human beings.

They are worse than ghosts.

TAKSTER RINPOCHE

You are in great danger. The Dalai

Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands.

You must flee.

TENZIN GYATSO

How could I ever leave?

TAKSTER RINPOCHE

It may not be your decision to make.

TENZIN GYATSO

I accept it.

TENZIN GYATSO (VO)

We shall send delegations to

America, India, Nepal and Great

Britain, in hope that these countries

will intervene on our behalf.

TENZIN GYATSO

We have telegraphed our appeal to the

United Nations and await its reply.

I am sending a delegation to China

to negotiate the Chinese withdrawal.

TENZIN GYATSO

It seems that I must depart Lhasa.

The majority wills it.

Lukhangwa and Lobsang Tashi?

TENZIN GYATSO

I am making you my Prime Ministers.

You will stay here.

You must always keep me informed,

no matter how bad the news.

I want plain information.

TENZIN GYATSO

Today, I declare a general

amnesty.

I have always wanted to free the

prisoners.

NORBU THUNDRUP (OC)

It's time to take this down.

TENZIN GYATSO

You will not come?

NORBU THUNDRUP

No, Holiness.

TENZIN GYATSO

Am I running away?

NORBU THUNDRUP

The people will cry when

they learn you are gone.

But they would all want you

safe.

NORBU THUNDRUP

Let me take this.

NORBU THUNDRUP

You must study very hard, do not

neglect the holy things during this

time.

TENZIN GYATSO

I will miss you.

NORBU THUNDRUP

We have had fun, you and I.

Fun for a little boy in an old

palace.

TENZIN GYATSO

We have.

NORBU THUNDRUP

You have grown up very good.

TENZIN GYATSO

And you have grown older and

your chin has grown balder.

NORBU THUNDRUP

Tonight, Kundun, you see the world.

You place your feet on the

shepherd boy's path.

NORBU THUNDRUP

"The Gods will be avenged."

NORBU THUNDRUP

I will send it to you.

It will work.

BODYGUARD

We must go, Holiness.

TENZIN GYATSO

A moment.

BODYGUARD

Please, come, Holiness.

TENZIN GYATSO

Yes.  I am ready.

TENZIN GYATSO

Safe journey.  Safe return.

I am him.

MONKS

Do not let him go!

We beg of you, do not take

him from us!

LING RINPOCHE

He goes for a short time, until

the danger can be determined.  He

will not leave Tibet.  He will

return.

LING RINPOCHE

He will return.

The Precious One will not abandon

you.

TENZIN GYATSO

All quiet?

BODYGUARD

Yes, Holiness.

TENZIN GYATSO

Where are you from?

BODYGUARD

Kham, Holiness.

TENZIN GYATSO

Your people are very brave.

They are fighting the Chinese.

No one can stop them.

Not even me.

BODYGUARD

Khambas are wild men.

TENZIN GYATSO

I worry about them.

BODYGUARD

Do not worry, Holiness.

They fight for you.

They are under your protection.

BODYGUARD

Holiness, this has come for you.

MUSLIM MAN

Eighteen children.

TENZIN GYATSO

Eighteen, wonderful.

MUSLIM MAN

And not a monk among them.

MUSLIM MAN

No, no son of mine will sit

and read books and eat up the

poor people's butter while

my people have to butcher

the cows and sheep because

these holy men can't kill

an animal.  They can eat

it, can't they?

TENZIN GYATSO

Did you love your husband, before

you married?

TIBETAN WOMAN

I did not know him before I

married him.  I loved his

brother, but then, I married his

brother, too.  He is dead now.

TENZIN GYATSO

Hmm.

TIBETAN WOMAN

The land has stayed in the family.

We work together.  The nobleman is

not too bad.

TENZIN GYATSO

Does he treat you fairly?

TIBETAN WOMAN

Not too bad.  Rich is rich,

poor is poor.  We are different.

Are you married?

TENZIN GYATSO

No.

TIBETAN WOMAN

Too young?

TENZIN GYATSO

Much too young.

TIBETAN WOMAN

Look for a strong woman, not

too occupied with her beauty.

Look for a woinan who keeps

her hands busy.  Look for

a kind heart.

TENZIN GYATSO

Like my mother.

TIBETAN WOMAN

I see that.

TENZIN GYATSO

This little brother was terribly

sweet.  When he died, my

mother was so sad.  A lama said

to her, before the little brother

was laid out for burial, take

a bit of butter and rub a spot on

his skin.  He will come back to you,

you will see.

So, my mother did this, and a few

years later, a new boy was born.

NOBLE BOY

Does he have the spot?

TENZIN GYATSO

He does, a little spot where the

butter had been.

NOBLE BOY

Is that a true story, or pretend?

TENZIN GYATSO

What do you think?

NOBLE BOY

True.

TENZIN GYATSO

You decide.

NOBLE BOY

What does the butter spot feel like?

TENZIN GYATSO

Soft.  Nice.

I have a good friend back in

Lhasa.  He has a very poor beard,

with a little spot on his chin

where no hair grows.  It feels like

that.

KASHAG MEMBER

Of the Tibetan delegations sent

abroad, all have been turned away.

TENZIN GYATSO (OC)

All?

KASHAG MEMBER

Britain, Nepal, America, India.

All of those governments have

refused to meet with our

representatives.

TENZIN GYATSO

And the United Nations?  Surely?

KASHAG MEMBER

The United Nations voted not to

hear our appeal.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

One country did sponsor the

resolution.  A land called "El

Salvador".

TENZIN GYATSO

Where is that?

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

In the Americas.

TENZIN GYATSO

So, we must face China and all

her might alone.

KASHAG MEMBER

Yes.

Most of the Chamdo region is

now in Chinese hands.  There is

a report from Chamdo which makes

quite clear that, unless some

settlement can soon be reached,

Communist troops will soon be

marching on Lhasa.

TENZIN GYATSO

With much bloodshed.

KASHAG MEMBER

I am afraid.

TENZIN GYATSO

I want at all costs to avoid this.

Do we have news from the delegation

in China?

KASHAG MEMBERR

Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo,

Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must

negotiate and offers to go to Peking.

TENZIN GYATSO

He is a capable man.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Your prime minsters would argue

that such negotiations should take

place in Lhasa.

TENZIN GYATSO

And then they would concede that the

times are desperate and we must go

to Peking.  Agreed.  Send Ngabo.

Is that all?

KASHAG MEMBER

Yes.

TENZIN GYATSO

Time to study.

TENZIN GYATSO

Wait.

TENZIN GYATSO

We are in the last outposts of Tibet.

Let's do away with some of this

formality.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

He is a modern man.

Just like he was the last time.

TENZIN GYATSO

"I will liberate those not

liberated."

I will release those not

released.

I will relieve those not

relieved.

May I deliver them to the

state of enlightenment."

RADIO VOICE (VO)

"Today in Peking, a Seventeen

Point Agreement for the peaceful

Liberation of Tibet has been signed

by Representatives of the Government

of the People's Republic of China

and the Local Government of Tibet."

RADIO VOICE (VO)

"Over the last hundred years or more

aggressive, imperialist forces

have penetrated into Tibet and

carried out all manner of deceptions

and provocations.  Under such

conditions the Tibetan nationality

was plunged into the depths

of enslavement and suffering."

RADIO VOICE (VO)

"Today, this enslavement ends.

Point One:  The Tibetan people

shall unite and drive out

imperialist aggressive forces from

Tibet. The Tibetan people shall

return to the big family of the

Motherland - the People's Republic

of China."

Point Two: The Local Government

of Tibet will actively assist

the People's Liberation Army to

enter Tibet and consolidate the

national defense."

LORD CHAMBERLAIN (OC)

It means we have lost our status

as an independent nation.

KASHAG MEMBER

Ngabo did not have the state

seal.  He could not sign.

TENZIN GYATSO

Yes, but they say he did.

KASHAG MEMBER

Holiness?

TENZIN GYATSO

Yes.

KASHAG MEMBER

General Chiang Chin-wu, the

Chinese representative,

is en route to Dromo.

He is coming to meet you.

TENZIN GYATSO

Then, we shall meet.

GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU

Dalai Lama.

TENZIN GYATSO

General Chiang.

GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU

We bring greetings from Chairman

Mao.

TENZIN GYATSO

Thank you.  Please sit.

GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU

Have you heard the terms of the

Seventeen Point Agreement?

TENZIN GYATSO

I have.

GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU

I have a copy for you.

GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU

We come in genuine friendship.

GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU

I am certain you wish to return to

Lhasa.

GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU

Do you have plans to return soon,

Dalai Lama?

TENZIN GYATSO

Soon.

GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU

Good.  Our first request is that you

allow us to build a road.  You have

no roads in Tibet.  We can discuss

the plans in Lhasa.  When you return.

GENERAL CHIANG-WU

Thank you.  We leave now.

TENZIN GYATSO

Let me see the agreement.

TENZIN GYATSO

Counterfeit.

TENZIN GYATSO

I thought he would be some kind of

monster, even with horns growing out

of his head.  But, he is only

a man, just an ordinary human

being, like myself.  Life is

always a lesson.

KASHAG MEMBER

Your Prime Ministers, support the

proposal that you return to Lhasa.

On the opposite hand, some officials

urge you not to return.  They

believe you should leave now,

for India.

TENZIN GYATSO

If I were to go into exile, could we

expect any serious assistance, from

India, suppose?

LORD CHANBERLAIN

It is unlikely.  America, perhaps.

There is great anti-communist feeling

in America.

TENZIN GYATSO

At this point, the most likely

result of a foreign pact is war.

LORD CHAABERLAIN

The Chinese would see such a

pact as an open declaration of war.

TENZIN GYATSO

Tibet, at war?  No.

China is close, America is far

away.  After countless people

die, China would still, always,

be close.  We will work

with what we have.

KASHAG MEMBER

And as for your own safety, Holiness?

TENZIN GYATSO

I am scared.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Shall we consult the protective

deities, Holiness?

TENZIN GYATSO

My first and foremost duty is to

protect my people.  I feel sure

of this.

And, things change.  Maybe not right

away, maybe not soon.  But I believe

this - things will change.

TENZIN GYATSO

Impermanence.

Our own short lifetimes are

not the only valid consideration.

I shall return.

TAKTRA RINPOCHE

I hope you will not feel badly

about all the things of childhood

you missed.

TAKTRA RINPOCHE

You lost so much.  I am sorry.

TAKTRA RINPOCHE

Goodbye, Kundun.

NORBU THUNDRUP (OC)

Goodbye, Kundun.

TENZIN GYATSO

(he only mouths it)

No!

FATHER

Goodbye, Kundun.

TENZIN GYATSO (silent)

No!

TENZIN GYATSO

No, Norbu!

GENERAL CHIANG (OC)

I hate meeting here, this

tribute to the past!  I demand

a less formal meeting place.

GENERAL CHIANG

I am not a foreigner!

I refuse to be treated like one.

TENZIN GYATSO

You see here thangkas of the

Fifth Dalai Lama, the founder

of our government.  It is tradition

at formal meetings for these

thangkas to be hung.

GENERAL CHIANG

Superstitions.  Tibet is part of a

modern nation.

GENERAL CHIANG

I want the songs stopped.

TENZIN GYATSO

Songs?  What songs?

PRIME MINISTER LUKHANGWA

Street songs about the General.

Reference to his gold watch.

He is right, they are quite

insulting.

TENZIN GYATSO

I have no authority to ban singing

in my country.

GENERAL CHIANG

You must also do something about

the public meetings.  I see this,

memorandum circulating, with Tibetan

grievances.

LUKHANGWA

You have cracked a man's skull

and that crack has not healed.

It is too soon to expect

him to be your friend.

GENERAL CHIANG

We are simply respecting the terms of

the Seventeen Point Agreement.

LUKHANGWA

Are you, General?

GENERAL CHIANG

We want 2,000 more tons of barley

distributed.

LUKHANGWA

Impossible!  You will bring famine

down on the people of Tibet with

these insatiable demands!

More food, the best land for

your soldiers to camp.

GENERAL CHIANG

The People's Liberation Army pays

for all food and lodging.

LUKHANGWA

So far, they do.

But, the quantity, it does not

exist.  You will have to re-

evaluate your needs.

GENERAL CHIANG

How much tea do you drink,

Prime Minister?

LUKHANGWA

It depends on the quality.

And, that it be Indian.

LUKHANGWA

Why is it necessary for the Chinese

to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?

GENERAL CHIANG

To protect.  To serve you.

Chairman Mao wants you to feel that

China belongs to you now.

LUKHANGWA

Chairman Mao can keep China.

Just give us back Tibet.

GENERAL CHIANG

Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army

into the People's Army will soon be

finalized.

LUKHANGWA

I will not approve it.

GENERAL CHIANG

Then, we will begin with replacing

the Tibetan flag with the flag of the

Motherland.

LUKHANGWA

And we will begin with tearing

it down.

TENZIN GYATSO

I am so sorry.

LUKHANGWA

It must be done.

We can no longer meet with the

Chinese, they refuse us.

TENZIN GYATSO

I accept your resignations.

LOBSANG TASHI

Have you chosen your new Prime

Ministers, Holiness?

TENZIN GYATSO

There will be no new Prime Ministers.

LUKHANGWA

You will face great difficulties,

Holiness.

TENZIN GYATSO

They have taken away our silence.

MAO TSE TUNG

The mission of China is to bring

progress to Tibet.  Develop its

natural resources.  Help its

people develop democracy.

We welcome you, Tibet, back to

the Motherland!

MAO TSE TUNG

I am so glad that Tibet has

come back to the Motherland.

MAO TSE TUNG

You must inform me at once if

any of our people abuse the

Tibetans trust and good nature.

TENZIN GYATSO

I have great hopes for the future of

our co-operation.

MAO TSE TUNG

It is too early to implement all the

clauses of the Seventeen Point

Agreement.  We will establish a

Preparatory Committee for the

Autonomous Region of Tibet.  The pace

of reform must meet with the

desires of the Tibetan people.

Changes must be made slowly, as you,

yourself, judge necessary.

TENZIN GYATSO

I am happy to hear you say this,

Chairman Mao.  I have created a

reform committee to investigate

grievances and we have abolished

Inherited Tax, and forgiven all

money owed the Government by

people who are unable to pay.

MAO TSE TUNG

Good. Very good.

Tibet is a great country.  A

a wonderful history.  Long ago, you

even conquered part of China.

But now you have fallen behind and we

want to help you.  In twenty years

time you could be ahead of us.

Then it will be your turn to help

China.

MAO TSE TUNG

You know, I have great respect for

your Lord Buddha.  He was anti-caste.

Anti-corruption.  Anti-exploitation.

For some, politics and religion can

mix.

TENZIN GYATSO

For me, I think such a mix is

crucial.

MAO TSE TUNG

Have a sweet. Made in my home

province.  The kind my mother used

to make.

TENZIN GYATSO

"If moral discipline is learned

from the beginning, one possesses

the root for achieving higher

rebirth.  A staircase for achieving

liberation.  An antidote eliminating

misery and sorrow.  Without

discipline there is no method."

TENZIN GYATSO

I am thinking of becoming a Communist

Party Member. I like what I see of

Marxism.  It is based on equality

and justice for all. I believe

Chairman Mao wishes the best for

our people.  Our path must be

non-violence.  Co-operation.

MAO TSE TUNG

Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for

coming so late.

TENZIN GYATSO

I leave tomorrow.

MAO TSE TUNG

Yes, I am aware.  How has your

time in China been?

TENZIN GYATSO

I have been greatly impressed by your

accomplishments.  Industrial

progress.  Great efficiency.

Your people are capable and

courteous.

MAO TSE TUNG

You have a lot to learn about

organization.  How to draw out

people's opinions.  How to make

key decisions.  Train your young

Tibetans.  When I make contact

with you, I want to reach you

through a Tibetan.

DALAI LAMA

Always.

MAO TSE TUNG

Your attitude is good, you know.

I understand you well.

But you need to learn this:

religion is poison.

It undermines the race and it

retards the progress of the

people.  Tibet has been poisoned

by religion.

"Religion is poison."

MAO TSE TUNG

Well, let me walk you to your car.

MAO TSE TUNG

Take care of your health.

TENZIN GYATSO

He will betray us.

LORD CHAMBEPIAIN

Did you ever doubt it?

TENZIN GYATSO

I had relinquished doubt.

TENZIN GYATSO

Are you happy?

OLD WOMAN

I am very happy and prosperous

under the guidance of the Chinese

Communist Party and chairman

Mao Tse Tung.

TENZIN GYATSO

I ask them to stop, to lay

down their guns.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

The Khamba's gun is his most prized

possession.  I admire them so.

They face a modern, well equipped

army, and still, they fight.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Land reform is underway in Amdo.  The

large estates are being confiscated

and redistributed. Landlords are

being punished.

TENZIN GYATSO

A beggar can be called a landlord if

he disapproves of the Chinese.

TENZIN GYATSO

I have always asked for plain

information.  Just the truth.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

The Communists put their guns

in the hands of the Khamba children

and force the child to kill

the parent.

They have dropped bombs

on the monastery of Lithang

in Kham.  It has been destroyed.

Women and children, trying to

escape from the fighting, have been

shot with machine guns, fired from

airplanes.

TENZIN GYATSO

The pursuit of non-violence.

Very difficult.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Non-violence means co-operation

when it is possible.  Resistance,

when it is not.

GENERAL CHIANG

We have decided that no drastic

changes will take place in Tibet

for six years. This should make

you happy.

GENERAL CHIANG

It seems a revolt has

broken out in the east.

We have decided that the Tibetan

army must be used against the

Khamba guerrillas.

TENZIN GYATSO

I will not approve it.

TENZIN GYATSO

You have bombed on peaceful

people.

GENERAL CHIANG

We must deal with these

reactionaries!

TENZIN GYATSO

No.  We are peace loving people.

I am afraid we cannot trust you.

GENERAL CHIANG

We are here to heal the people

of Tibet.  You need reform.

You have no sense of what

is good for your people.

We are here to liberate

you!

TENZIN GYATSO

I burn here, but I am not suppose

to let the smoke show.  Yes, we need

reform.  The monasteries.

Communications.  Schools.  But we

want change for Tibet, as Tibet needs

it, not for China.

TENZIN GYATSO

Buddha is our physician, General, he

will heal us.  Comapssion and

enlightnement will set us free.

You can not liberate me

I can only liberate myself.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

They will take Lhasa next.

TENZIN GYATSO

The people will not allow it.

NECHUNG ORACLE

Where there is no crossing

a big river, no fords, no

shallows, where the only hope is a

boat, and there is no boat...

I will put a boat, Kundun.

The wish-Fulfilling Jewel will

shine from the West.

TENZIN GYATSO (OC)

"I rejoice in the Awakening of the

Buddhas, and also in the spiritual

levels of their Sons."

TENZIN GYATSO (OC)

"And with gladness I rejoice

in the ocean of virtue from

developing an awakening mind

that wishes all beings to be

happy..."

TENZIN GYATSO (OC)

"As well as in the deeds that bring

them benefit.

TENZIN GYATSO

AND OTHERS (OC)

"With folded hands I beseech

the Buddhas of all directions.

To shine the lamp of Dharma

For all bewildered in the gloom of

misery."

TENZIN GYATSO AND OTHERS

"With folded hands I beseech

the Conquerors who wish to pass away,

to please remain for countless aeons

And not to leave the world in

darkness."

TENZIN GYATSO (OC)

"Thus by the virtue collected

Through all that I have done,

May the pain of every living

creature be completely cleared away."

His Holiness, the Dalai Lama of

Tibet, is invited to attend a Dance

Recital at the newly erected, Great

Hall of the Liberation Army.

10 March, 1959.

WOMEN (OC)

Chinese, GO!

Chinese, GO!

Chinese, GO!

EXT.  DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE, NORBULINKA  DAY

Tenzin Gyatso steps outside.  The shouting grows louder:

WOMEN AND MEN (OC)

Chinese, GO!

Chinese, GO!

Chinese, GO!

WOMEN AND HEN (OC)

Chinese, GO!

Chinese, GO!

Chinese, GO!

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

The crowd will not disperse

until you give your assurance that

you will not attend the Chinese

festivities.

Many who have been invited to dine

with the Chinese do not return home.

TENZIN GYATSO

I will not go.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

I will alert the Chinese delegation.

You know, I would never have let you

go alone, Kundun.

MOTHER (OC)

Did you come to tell me we are

leaving Lhasa?

TENZIN GYATSO

Do you think I must?

MOTHER

You decide.

TENZIN GYATSO

Tibet has never been part of

China.  We are different races.

We are different cultures.

We need change, we know that.

But we could do it alone.

We were just about to do it

alone.

TENZIN GYATSO

I am afraid I will go.

Far, far away.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

We are now accused of aiding the

rebels.  The Chinese said we can

expect drastic measures to be

taken to crush this revolt.

TENZIN GYATSO

Arrange for me to speak to the

people's leaders.

TENZIN GYATSO

I fear that there will be great

bloodshed if you cannot convince

the people to disperse and go home.

I am safe.

FIRST LEADER

Holiness, the Chinese tried to entice

you to their garrison with

out protection of bodyguard.

Even now, they urge you to come

to them for safety. They are

bringing more troops and guns and

artillery into Lhasa.

There are three airplanes waiting

outside Lhasa. What do they wait

for?  They are planning to kill the

Dalai Lama.  Don't you see?

NECHUNG ORACLE

Stay.

NECHUNG ORACLE

Stay.  I tell you to stay.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

The Chinese are planning to attack

the crowd and shell the Norbulinka.

You are asked to indicate on a map

where you will be so that the

artillery men will not mistakenly

aim at you.

TENZIN GYATSO

Tell them I will be here.

With my people. Right here.

ORACLE

Go!  Go!  Tonight!

ORACLE

Go!  Tonight!  Go!

Please do not resist.

Take refuge on the far side of the

river.

TENZIN GYATSO

Dim the lights.

TENZIN GYATSO

Wait.

TENZIN GYATSO

I see a safe journey.

TENZIN GYATSO

I see a safe return.

TENZIN GYATSO

Now.  I am ready.

SOLDIER

Move aside, tour of inspection,

move aside.

KHAMBA BODYGUARD

Move aside, let us through.

Move aside!

TENZIN GYATSO

I have always loved mountains.

TENZIN GYATSO

"Right will be victorious."

LORD CHAMBERLAIN

"The Gods will be avenged!"

TENZIN GYATSO

I repudiate the Seventeen Point

Agreement

TENZIN GYATSO

I constitute the Government

of Tibet, the only legal

authority in the land.

SOLDIER

With all respect, may I ask?

Who are you?

TENZIN GYATSO

What you see before you is

a man.  A simple monk.

SOLDIER

Are you the Lord Buddha?

TENZIN GYATSO

I think I am a reflection,

like the moon, on water.

When you see me, and I try

to be a good man, see

yourself

The Dalai Lama has not yet

returned to Tibet.

He hopes one day to make the journey.
