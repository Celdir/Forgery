The Day the Clown Cried

COLD OPENING

STRAIGHT CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MIDGET

Coffee?  It's nice and hot.

MIDGET

15 Minutes to circus... 15 minutes

to circus.

CUT TO:

RINGMASTER

Ladies and gentlemen, we proudly

present... "The Clowns"!

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MR SCHMIDT

(in the middle of his

tirade)

Not to mention how unprofessional

that was...

HELMUT

But it was an accident...

GUSTAV

Oh, sure it was... A very well planned

and calculated accident!

HELMUT

I swear to you... it was an accident!

GUSTAV

I don't want to hear any more...

You will get me another stooge. I

don't want this man!!

SCHMIDT

Don't get excited, Gustav, you shall

have it.

GUSTAV

You bet I will, or you shall have no

show.

SCHMIDT

(moving to Helmut's

trunk, leaning over

into Helmut's ear)

You will run with the other clowns

and that's all you will do... is

that clear?

SCHMIDT

(continuing)

And if there is another one of your

cute tricks... I promise you will do

your bits for the "Cats" while

cleaning their cages!

RINGLING BROS. & BARNUM AND BAILEY

PRESENTS

THE WORLD'S GREATEST CLOWN "HELMUT"

SCHMIDT

From Germany

HELMUT

Clause... give me a double whiskey

with beer chaser.

CLAUSE

(who knows him)

You won't get "Funny" out of a bottle.

HELMUT

And you won't make a dime sticking

your nose in other people's business.

STRAIGHT CUT TO:

ADA

Helmut, darling, are you all right?

HELMUT

(nastily)

Do I look like I'm not all right?

ADA

I was so worried about you...  Your

dinner is cold and I couldn't imagine

what happened to you...

HELMUT

Were you really worried about me or

your stupid dinner was getting cold?

ADA

Sweetheart, I care about you...  I

love you... I worry about you...  I

can't help those feelings...

HELMUT

If there is anything I don't need

right now... it's your super-

sentimentality...

ADA

Helmut... what's tormenting your

soul?  Please let me help you...

talk to me...  I don't care what it

is... I love you...  I'm your

friend... you can trust me to

understand...

HELMUT

I can't trust anybody... I don't

know how to trust anybody...

ADA

I'm not anybody!  I'm your wife!

HELMUT

I'm sorry, my love... I'm so sorry...

You're right!  You're not anybody.

You're my wife and I love you, too...

So very much I just have no one to

fight back at... I'm lost and alone,

I can't handle the disgrace of

failure... the pain of being a has-

been is more than I can bear...

ADA

Schmidt again?  Gustav again?  When

will you learn they fear you and

they know how vulnerable you are

now...  if they can beat you down

then they needn't worry about you

coming back to haunt them.

HELMUT

They worry about me?  Don't be

ridiculous...  they just took the

last comic bit away from me... because

of a silly accident...  I'm now down

at the bottom, just a stooge assisting

a not-so-funny clown.

ADA

But they can't take your talent

away...  That's your strongest force!

HELMUT

What the hell are you talking about?

What talent?  And if I had any it's

being suffocated into nothing...

And that's just what I am now...

nothing... No one... just empty...

a prop to be used and mis-used...

how does my great talent stand up to

those odds?

ADA

By not quitting... You must fight!

Creative survival is even more

difficult than human survival...

You must fight!!!

ADA

(continuing)

Go to Schmidt... Force a

confrontation...  Don't let Gustav

win...  make Schmidt see what an

injustice they are imposing on you...

Please, my love, fight!  Make your

world better by fighting for it...

You can do it... I know you can...

HELMUT

I will go now and see Schmidt...

I will tell him I won't take any

more degradation... I will tell him

I am a "clown" not a stooge...  A

"clown"... A special person...  A

special clown...

ADA

(placing the hat on

his head)

Go, my love... Go and fight for what

you know is right... I will warm

your dinner and wait for you to come

home.

DISSOLVE TO:

BACK TO:

CUT TO:

SCHMIDT

Naturally, I agree... Doork is a

nuisance, but to just let him go

seems a little unfair.

GUSTAV

Schmidt!  Don't make me put it on a

"either him or me basis".

SCHMIDT

All right... all right... I'll give

him --

CUT TO:

SCHMIDT (V.O.)

-- his two weeks notice tomorrow.

Will that satisfy you?

GUSTAV (V.O.)

Perfectly!!  Let's have a drink...

CLAUSE

(pouring still another

blast)

It's your funeral.

HELMUT

(not too clearly)

A funeral is usually in order when

someone dies.

HELMUT

The trouble with man today is that

he takes everything for granted...

he thinks things he's told to think...

and accepts it! Just because we know

meanings of words we use them and we

fool ourselves...  people should use

the dictionary more...  look up words

like good... bad... honest... loyal...

especially loyal,  I know what loyal

means, and I have always been that...

but does anyone care?  No!  Of course

not...  Only when it is expedient...

When it isn't ---

(he slashes his throat

with his finger)

--- ZIPPPP!  You're out!

HELMUT

And that goes for you too... Mine

Fuhrer...

HELMUT

... you, too, are a fool.  You allow

yourself to think you have "loyal"

followers...  Ha!  Wait until they've

had it with you...  You'll get

yours... all the smiling, bowing,

heel clicking idiots will shaft you

too.  And you will deserve it because

if you allow people like Herr Schmidt

to got about his business of lying,

and cheating, and being disloyal,

one day all the Schmidts in Germany

will turn on you and you will finish

as the dumb little corporal you

started as, and never know what hit

you...

HELMUT

He really has to be stupid --

(indicating Hitler)

I could help him by telling him about

the people he thinks are good

Germans... Ha!

HELMUT

(angrily)

What are you staring at?  Didn't you

ever see a man drink before?

HELMUT

What's the matter?  Haven't you guys

got a sense of humor?  You must have!

Look how you're dressed!  Grown men

in their little soldier suits... And

the black coats and gloves... Like

in a movie...

HELMUT

Real cloak and dagger stuff...  Didn't

you Gestapo guys ever know that

everybody can spot you a mile away?

(leaning over and

whispering)

Listen, if you really wanted to be

unnoticed...  You should dress like

plain people, then nobody would

know you... You might even wear straw

hats and shorts...

HELMUT

Straw hats and shorts!!  That's funny!

Now that's really funny, isn't it?

Straw hats and shorts!

HELMUT

Well, isn't that funny?   Think of

it...  That's funny!   Why don't you

laugh?

HELMUT

(gets an idea)

I know why you're not laughing...

Because things you hear, you have to

think about... I'll show you something

that you'll laugh at because all

you'll have to do is watch...

HELMUT

Ve vill conquer the world...  Heil

me!  Heil me!  Heil me!

DISSOLVE TO:

REICHER

STEINER !!!!  Get in here!

CORPORAL

Heil Hitler!

(shooting that stiff

arm out like on a

spring!)

Reicher flips his wrist in answer to

the heil, showing complete annoyance

at having to do it.

REICHER

Do I see what I think I see here?

REICHER

Never put your hands on my desk...

is that clear?

CORPORAL

(meekly)

Yes sir!

REICHER

MOVE IT!!

REICHER

(picking the folder

up)

Now tell me, is this brief correct?

Is that prisoner, the drunk, the one

that impersonated the Fuehrer?

CORPORAL

Yes sir!  It is!

REICHER

(to himself)

I get all the weirdos...  Alright,

Corporal, send him in!

CORPORAL

Yes sir!!!!

REICHER

Alright, come in, sit down!

REICHER

(soft spoken)

Are you Helmut Doork?

HELMUT

(nervously)

Doork, yes sir, Helmut Doork!  I am

he!  Yes sir, that is correct, Doork!

REICHER

And are you a clown in the circus?

HELMUT

(ego setting in and

forgetting for a

moment his trouble

and danger)

Not JUST A CLOWN!  I am Helmut Doork,

Premier Clown!  I've clowned for the

royal heads of many of our finest

countries, why there were times when

I had to...

REICHER

(breaking in)

That was years ago... According to

these papers you are now just a helper

in the circus with little or no

importance!!

HELMUT

(meekly)

Some things are only temporary...

Lt. Reicher!  Only yesterday, I had

calls from one of the great circus

owners in all of Europe... he...

REICHER

(breaking in, strong

and angry)

You are NOTHING!!  You are a HAS

BEEN!!  You WERE A CLOWN...

REICHER

(continuing)

You are now a prisoner of the State

and that's not funny... Can you make

something funny out of that, Clown?

HELMUT

(softly)

No!  Lt. Reicher, I can't make

anything funny from that thought...

REICHER

It is no thought... It is fact, Clown,

unquestionable fact!!  Now down to

the issues at hand...  Did you

willfully and with malice attack the

State and impersonate the Fuhrer?

HELMUT

(softly)

I was drunk!  It was a mistake!  I

meant no disrespect... Sir...

Honestly, I was drunk and not

responsible for my actions and

thoughts!  And my actions were

subconscious!

REICHER

(screaming)

Subconscious??  Meaning it was all

motivated by truth that came out

under the influence of alcohol!

HELMUT

(still softly)

I am a LOYAL German!

REICHER

And what kind of commendation would

you expect for being a loyal German?

HELMUT

I want nothing!  But I'm more loyal

than most Germans I know...

REICHER

Like who?

HELMUT

Ah, like... re...

REICHER

Names!   Names!!!  Who?

HELMUT

I don't know...

REICHER

Sir!!!

HELMUT

I don't know, sir...

REICHER

But you said other Germans... What

OTHER Germans...  Who are they?  Why

aren't they loyal?  Who?

HELMUT

(trying desperately

to cop out)

I'm not responsible for what I say

now...

REICHER

Why?  You're not drinking... you

said you weren't responsible last

night because you were drunk!  Are

you drunk now?

HELMUT

No, sir!

REICHER

Then why are you not responsible

now?

HELMUT

I don't know!!

REICHER

SIR!!!

HELMUT

I don't know -- sir !!!

REICHER

Why are you not responsible?  Why?

Why?  Why?  Why?

DISSOLVE TO:

ADA

Excuse me, sir, but I wonder if you

would help me... you see...

S.S. MAN

(very briskly)

No!  Go away!

ADA

You don't understand...

S.S. MAN

You don't understand...  I said go

away !!

ADA

HELMUT !

S.S. MAN

Move along... you swine... move...

we haven't got all day... move...

move... one-two-three-four --

S.S. MAN

Move it... move it... move...  move...

hurry... faster... faster...

S.S. MAN

(the same one at the

gate who told her to

go away)

Now I would be glad to help you,

Fraulein... shall we start with a

drink?  There is a lovely little bar

around the corner...

ADA

Go away !!

DISSOLVE TO:

STRAIGHT CUT TO:

GUARD

Tsk!  tsk!  tsk!  shame on you,

Doork... shame...  don't you want to

grow big and strong like me?

GUARD

We must eat our food!  Do we want

Uncle to feed the little man?

GUARD

(continuing to feed

him as he puts the

spoon in his mouth)

And now one for Aunt Ada...

GUARD

(pulling the spoon)

Let go, Doork, let go... it's the

soup that makes us big and strong...

not the spoon... LET IT GO!

GUARD

(continuing)

Now let's try it again...

GUARD

I said let's try it again...

GUARD

Oh, I know why you're unhappy...

soup without bread is terrible...

GUARD

Isn't that better?  Now take some

soup...

HELMUT

I've had enough, thank you... No

more, please...

HELMUT

Please!

GUARD

I'm surprised at you, Doork, you've

been here two years now, you should

have learned we, of the Third Reich,

never acknowledge the weak, sniveling,

begging of you swine...  that's all

you're good for... begging...

pleading... praying...  you're a

disgrace to the human race.  That's

why we of the superior race must do

away with all of you...

GUARD

And we will!  We will!  Do away with

all of you.  You're worthless pigs...

with no courage, no guts, why if

anyone did to me what I just did to

Doork I would kill him!

(turning to Helmut)

Why don't you kill me, Doork?  Go

on...  kill me... kill me... take

the knife from the table and kill

me...

HELMUT

(with knife in hand)

I would kill you... but I am getting

my release any day now... and I won't

do anything that would spoil my

chances...

GUARD

Your release?

GUARD

Release?  They told me you were

funny...  but I never realized just

how funny you are...  RELEASE ????

DISSOLVE TO:

HELMUT

(not aware Keltner is

behind him)

Dear God, please hear me!

KELTNER

He hears you, my son...

KELTNER

(sympathetically)

Here, here, easy, you can't do this

to yourself...

HELMUT

You frightened me, Johann, I'm

sorry...

KELTNER

(softly)

You have nothing to be sorry for...

Fear isn't something controlled by

man...  fear can not be conferred

with...  there isn't anyway known to

mankind where man can say to

himself...  "I will not be afraid"...

Oh, certainly man can try to fight

it... but faith and believing are

man's only chance...  You must have

faith... you must!

HELMUT

I have faith... but not always...

sometimes it eludes me...  I can't

remember to remember it.

KELTNER

But that's natural... you can't expect

to be perfect in what you try to

do...

HELMUT

I don't know...

KELTNER

I heard what happened at breakfast

this morning with ROTHMAN, the

guard...

HELMUT

Will they do something to me? What

have you heard?

KELTNER

(putting his arm around

him)

Nothing, absolutely nothing... don't

worry about it... I just wanted you

to know that I believe you handled

yourself admirably...

HELMUT

That was one time I didn't care for

the laughs I was getting from some

of the men...

KELTNER

Of course you didn't... but I'm sure

you know man laughs for two reasons...

one because something is funny...

two, because they fear showing fear...

they laughed because "there but for

the grace of God go I!"

HELMUT

Do you really think so?

KELTNER

I'm certain of it!

HELMUT

Thank you, Johann.  I always feel so

much better after you talk to me...

KELTNER

I'm glad, Helmut, I'm very glad...

you know you can always talk to me,

about anything...

HELMUT

(remembering)

Oh!  I almost forgot...

HELMUT

Before breakfast this morning,  I

spoke to one of the guards, a very

intelligent one, and he seems quite

nice and friendly too.  Well, he

said that the Gestapo has set up a

special review board to handle cases

just like mine.  And he said he would

get me a form, a special form.  Just

been printed up.  And I'm to fill it

out.  Isn't that good?

KELTNER

How many times since you've been

here, have you filled out forms?

Twenty?  Thirty times??

HELMUT

(in fast)

But this is different.  It's entirely

new.

HELMUT

See?  These are made up by the Gestapo

itself... and the form will go

directly to Berlin, to Gestapo

headquarters.  That's the important

thing about this... the Gestapo's in

on it.  That's a very good sign.

(a beat)

Isn't it a good sign?

KELTNER

(sympathetically)

Yes, my son, it is a good sign.

HELMUT

(in fast, excited;

scanning the papers)

And I have to be very careful of

everything I put down on the form.

The tiniest detail could make the

difference.  Don't you agree?

KELTNER

Isn't it strange?  They are free to

go anywhere they want, and they come

here to nest.

KELTNER

(softly)

Watch the birds eat, Helmut... it's

so cute...

HELMUT

I'm sure I've got everything here...

The important facts from the moment

I was arrested, the questions the

Gestapo officer asked me...  now

what was his name again?  I can't

seem to remember what his name was...

KELTNER

HELMUT...

HELMUT

What the devil was his name?

KELTNER  (LOUDER)

HELMUT !

HELMUT

(coming out of it)

Oh, yes, Johann... I'm sorry... you

were saying?

KELTNER

You're not a religious man, are you,

Helmut?

HELMUT

(thinking about it)

Well, I... ah...

KELTNER

Not sure I am myself anymore.

KELTNER

Yet... when I see those birds, I

wonder...  were they sent here to

let us know this place really isn't

God forsaken?

HELMUT

He should have sent them elsewhere...

they could be eaten here!

DISSOLVE TO:

LUDWIG

(seriously)

I think we should eat it!

KELTNER

Not on your life...

(catching himself)

Er, that is... I wouldn't...

FRANZ

Put it somewhere so it can brighten

up the place.

LUDWIG

(sourly)

It would take a hell of a lot more

than that to brighten up this place.

ADOLF

It'll be better than looking at your

long face.

KELTNER

(to Helmut)

Do you see the way it's sprouting...

I told you it wasn't completely

rotten.

HELMUT

(his mind on his thing)

That's nice, Johann.  Do you remember

when I filled out those last forms?

The date might be important.

KELTNER

(almost annoyed)

About four weeks ago, I think.

KELTNER

I'll put it up here on the window

sill, it'll get the morning sun.

STOUT PRISONER

Think you can trust your potato so

close to me, Reverend?

LUDWIG

The potato he TRUSTS... it's you he

doesn't trust!

GUARD

ATTENTION !

GUARD

All the prisoners from the other

side of the camp are being moved

over to this side of the camp over

to this side of the camp.  Barracks

"H" will make room for three

additional bunks.

GUARD

I want all the bunks moved down toward

the far end.  Get them as close

together as possible. Now! GET MOVING!

THE MEN

(ad lib)

Gotta have more room... We need more

space...  Hey, watch where you're

going. This is stupid!

GUARD

(yelling)

YOU!  You down there at the end...

get those bunks right up against the

wall.

GUARD

Hurry it up!  Come on, get moving!

GUARD

Get them close.

(he looks around the

barracks)

You're all going to be nice and cozy

in here.

STOUT PRISONER

(in a loud voice)

Yeah, like triplets before they are

born to a mother weighing 98 pounds...

HERMAN

That's what I call cozy!

HELMUT

(anxiously)

Excuse me, sir, the papers...  Did

they arrive yet?

GUARD

(annoyed)

They'll have to wait!

HELMUT

You'd think, since he was coming

over here anyway, the least he could

do was bring the papers with him.

KELTNER

This moving men around has undoubtedly

kept him very busy... don't worry,

he'll bring them.

HELMUT

I'm sure if I asked him again he'd

really become annoyed with me.  Would

you remind him for me, please?

KELTNER

(kindly)

Of course I will.

KELTNER

I've seen you around the yard, but

the others...

WHITE-HAIRED MAN

About thirty of them got here

yesterday from the prison outside of

Frankfurt.

1ST NEW PRISONER

(who occupies the

bunk above the white-

haired prisoner)

For the last three months we've been

shuttled from one camp to another.

2ND NEW PRISONER

(his bunk is the lower

bunk on the direct

opposite side)

Now they're shuffling us from one

side to another.  I think they're

trying to lose us.

HERMAN

Do you think they're bringing in war

prisoners?

LUDWIG

I don't know why they're sending

them here...  we're overcrowded as

it is.

KELTNER

No, no... it's got to be something

else...  Otherwise they would have

left the bunks.

ADOLF

It could be possible that he is fixing

up the barracks for some of his lady

friends.

KELTNER

That many women?

HERMAN

(standing at attention)

Reverend, we Germans are SUPERMEN!

GUARD

ATTENTION !

GALT

We might as well be outside.

UHLMANN

If I get pneumonia, I'll hold the

government responsible!

GUARD

With a little luck, you'll both get

pneumonia!

UHLMANN

(sitting on his bunk)

It's sure quiet in here...

UHLMANN

Hey, Galt!  Come over and look at

this!

GALT

(coming over to Uhlmann)

What is it?

UHLMANN

Ain't it cute?

GALT

It's a God damn posie!

UHLMANN

Looks kinda sick, doesn't it?

GALT

(examining it)

It's one of them potato things...

and it sure as hell is sick!

UHLMANN

Maybe we should put it out of its

misery.

GALT

No, we don't want to do that...  we

might break someone's heart.

GALT

Whose little plant is this?

KELTNER

(with deep conviction)

The plant is MINE!

GALT

Is it now?  Tell me precious... do

you knit, too?

KELTNER

If necessary, I can... and I do !

GALT

(to Uhlmann)

What do you think of that, Uhlmann...

he knits!

UHLMANN

Now, if he could just cook...

GALT

(coming out of the

laugh)

Can you cook, sweetheart?

KELTNER

If necessary, I can cook, yes!  Now,

if you don't mind, I'll take that

plant!

GALT

Alright, old man, you really want

it?

GALT

Go get it!!

HELMUT

Why don't you pick on someone your

own size...

GALT

(shocked, but pleased

that he finally got

a rise out of someone)

What?

HELMUT

(firmly)

You heard me!  Give him his plant

back, and leave him alone...  He

didn't bother you ... and if you

have to show your muscle, there's

plenty of other guys to pick on!

GALT

You're my size!

GALT

He's alright... that'll teach him to

keep his nose out of my business...

here's your plant!

GALT

(still holding the

plant up high)

Go on, little man, reach for it!

HERMAN

(in a low menacing

voice)

Give it to him!

ADOLF

You heard him... give it to him!

FRANZ

You've had your fun... give it to

him... NOW!

STOUT PRISONER

(closing in on Galt)

RIGHT NOW!!

GALT

Sure, here's your stupid flower or

whatever you call it...

KELTNER

Thank you...

GALT

What's the matter with you guys?

Can't you take a joke?

ADOLF

What joke?

GALT

Hell, all I was doing was trying to

have a little fun.

LUDWIG

Have it with someone else!

GALT

What's so special about him?

ADOLF

That's the Reverend.  Even when they

came and dragged him from his

church...  he kept right on preaching

against them until they knocked him

unconscious.

GALT

Well, how the hell was I supposed to

know?

HERMAN

NOW you know!

GALT

You and your posies...

UHLMANN

That was close...

GALT

Where were you when I need you?

UHLMANN

I make love, not war!

(goes giggly over

what he just said)

Hey, that's pretty good... I made

that up... Make love, not war!  I

bet that would make a good slogan

someday...

GALT

Aw, shut up!

KELTNER

That was really very nice of you,

Helmut...

HELMUT

Yeah, nice and STUPID!

DISSOLVE TO:

GUARD

(annoyed at being

bothered)

Come in!

GUARD

(breaking the silence)

What the hell are you doing here?

Who gave you permission to leave

your quarters?

GUARD

Are you some kind of privileged

character?

GUARD

Then what are you doing out of the

barracks?

HELMUT

(turning red)

If you'll shut your stupid mouth

maybe I can answer one of your

questions!

GUARD

(nose to nose with

Helmut)

I have a STUPID MOUTH?

HELMUT

(meekly)

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to raise my

voice...

GUARD

The volume of your voice isn't the

issue...  it's what comes out of

your mouth that disturbs me...  maybe

you need a little lesson in respect

and courtesy...

GUARD

... and maybe I've been a little too

soft with you...

GUARD

You see, Doork, I knew why you came

in here...  I knew why you left your

barracks without permission... It's

just that I hadn't heard you mention

your release papers for so long I

had hoped I could hear you begging

once more...

HELMUT

(in a whisper)

I'm sorry...

GUARD

(mimicking him)

I'm sorry, I'm sorry... You're a

sorry specimen of a human being...

that's what you are...

GUARD

Now, I will help you to your quarters,

Herr Doork, here you will stay, and

pray for release papers that may, or

may not, ever come...

GUARD

Now, get inside where you belong and

don't ever let me catch you doing

anything without permission again.

GUARD

(yelling across the

barracks)

Reverend!  If you don't watch that

idiot, we may have to get him a

keeper!

KELTNER

Helmut, Helmut, how could you think

of doing such a thing? I begged you

not to irritate him...  and that I

would ask him about your papers...

that wasn't smart, Helmut... not

smart at all...  as a matter of

fact...

HELMUT

(gritting his teeth)

Leave me alone!  ... and mind your

own business... Just leave me be...

DISSOLVE TO:

GUARD

(in a sotto voice)

Reverend, let him sleep... you move

out, I'll take care of this...

GUARD

(as he finishes his

walk)

You are a sick looking group of

things...  I can't even call you

human...  because you're not... you're

all lice...  DISMISSED!

GUARD

Doork!  Move it out, and on the

double!!

DISSOLVE TO:

LUDWIG

(nudging Adolf)

It looks like Helmut found some new

ears to listen to his Super Star

fantasies...

LUDWIG

(to himself, but for

Adolf to hear as

well; a la

Shakespeare, mimicking

Helmut)

Ringling Brothers would have done

anything for me to appear with them

but I had to do what was best for

me!

HELMUT

So I told Mr. Ringling if he wanted

"Helmut" he'd have to bring his circus

to Germany... I am a German, I told

him, and my responsibility is to my

own people who are my biggest fans.

1ST PRISONER (NEW ONE)

Did you really say that?

HELMUT

(proudly)

Of course I did... they offered me

anything...  anything I wanted to go

with them.

2ND NEW PRISONER

Hey! I saw the circus in Berlin about

four years ago...  Didn't  you make

your entrance in a long tail coat

with a pair of tails on the jacket

about fifty feet long?  Sure!  And a

funny Little clown at the very end

carrying the tails like a woman's

train?

2ND NEW PRISONER

You were great!

2ND NEW PRISONER

You should have seen him... You'd

never know it was him... with the

long tails  and white tie... red

nose...  long hair...  and a battered

top hat... with the hair hanging way

down to his shoulders...  and, ah,

let me see... oh, yeah... your mouth

went from ear to ear.

HELMUT

(softly)

Right!

3RD NEW PRISONER

How do "clowns" ever come up with

such ideas for faces and make-up?

HELMUT

It doesn't happen overnight... it

takes years and years... You try

many faces, then finally you hit the

one that's just right for you.

4TH NEW PRISONER

My kids will never believe this, I

can't wait to... tell...

HELMUT

(emotionally)

Wait, let me tell you some other

things...  I mean things that are

really exciting and...  please!

Please... let me just have a few

more...

1ST NEW PRISONER

(ignoring Helmut

completely)

What's going on with those guys?

HELMUT

(a last attempt)

Did you know "clowns" literally

bequeath their faces to their sons,

or sometimes to...

3RD PRISONER

Come on, let's see what's such fun...

UHLMANN

Hey, Galt, it's your turn, how about

doin' one of your belly dances for

us?

GALT

Reverend?

GALT

Well, Reverend, what do you think?

Would a little belly-dancing be too

much for the boys?

KELTNER

(moving over towards

Galt)

A little fun is what we need... so...

if you'll all hold the noise down,

I'll join in.

4TH NEW PRISONER

Say, why don't we get the clown to

do something?

GALT

A clown?  Who's a clown??

HERMAN

You've heard of "Helmut Doork".

That's him down there!

LUDWIG

Don't waste your time.  You'll never

get the Great Doork to do anything.

1ST NEW PRISONER

Oh, I'm sure he will!

ADOLF

You're wasting your time.  He doesn't

perform for the likes of us... he'll

turn you down.

LUDWIG

He's right, we've been asking him

for three years...  I have a feeling

he only does his little routines for

the crowned heads of Europe.

ADOLF

And, of course, the BIG heads of

Berlin.

1ST PRISONER

How about it, Doork?

HELMUT

(swinging his legs

around ready to jump

down)

I'd like to, but I can't... really...

I can't.

GALT

(strongly)

Can't?  Did I hear you say you can't?

HELMUT

(it stops him in his

tracks; he stays up

on the bunk)

I'd like to do something... but...

(pointing to the 2nd

New Prisoner)

He can tell you... He's seen me

work...  I need props... make-up...

I work with a lot of different

things...

2ND NEW PRISONER

That's right... I did... and he does!

HELMUT

(in fast)

Sure, tell them... I can't just do

anything...  I need lights, props,

my costume.

GALT

(gritting his teeth)

Now, me and these... gentlemen...

we don't expect you to do your "act",

just a little something that'll give

us a laugh, that's all.

LUDWIG

(to all the men)

Aw, forget it... and that's probably

his problem...  he's forgotten how!

GALT

(trying to suck him

in)

Wait a minute, you guys... show people

have to be in a mood...

(to Franz)

Play a little music, like in a

circus...

GALT

There!  Ain't that nice?  Don't it

put you in a mood?

HELMUT

(getting fed up)

I TOLD YOU!  I need things to do my

act.

2ND NEW PRISONER

Hey, Doork, what about that drunk

routine... that was funny...

GALT

(pacifying his head

off)

Yeah, that drunk thing...  that does

sound funny...

HELMUT

I still need many things... props

and...

2ND NEW PRISONER

(puzzled)

I don't remember you using anything

in that drunk routine.

GALT

(starting to fume)

Hey... are you trying to fool us?

KELTNER

Leave him alone!

GALT

Stay out of this, Reverend. We're

not doing anything... We just want

him to join in the fun.

UHLMANN

(to the men)

Right!  If a Reverend can give us a

laugh, why not a clown?

KELTNER

(to Helmut, softly)

It doesn't have to be anything

special... a little dance, maybe?

HELMUT

(taking it all out on

Keltner)

Like that disgusting exhibition you

did?  Oh, no... not me!

4TH NEW PRISONER

Go on, Doork, so I can tell my kids.

HELMUT

Can't you get it through your heads,

I need...

GALT

(firmly)

WE need you to give us a laugh.

GALT

So... TRY!

KELTNER

That's enough, leave him alone!

GALT

Stay out of it, Reverend!

THE MEN

(ad lib)

Choke him harder...  see if that's

funny!  Make him dance! Hey, Doork!...

be funny now! He don't look so funny

to me!  He sure as hell looks funny

to me!  Hey, Galt, pull his string

and make the dummy funny!

GALT

Your public is calling, clown...

now, clown!

GUARD

(walking slowly into

the barracks)

What is going on here?

(to Helmut)

On your feet!

GALT

(like a little boy)

He was showing us some of his funny

clown falls...

GUARD

Because of all the noise coming from

in here -- I have been called up

front to explain...  I don't like to

be called up front...  I don't like

to have to explain...

(menacingly)

And, you might not like it, either.

(a beat)

Back to your bunks, all of you...

Turn out the lights, and keep it

QUIET !

HELMUT

(whispering)

I was just going to ask him about

the forms... my release...

KELTNER

(shaking his head)

That was not the time, believe me!

KELTNER

Hurt much?

HELMUT

(beaten)

No, I'm alright... thank you.

HELMUT

Johann, why do they pick on me?

I've never done anything to them.

KELTNER

You've never done anything for them!

HELMUT

You think I should have performed?

KELTNER

The men would have appreciated it.

HELMUT

Johann!

KELTNER

(he stands up, eye

level with Helmut)

What is it?

HELMUT

They don't believe me, do they?  I

mean about being a clown?

KELTNER

Oh, I'd say you've convinced most.

However --

(a long beat)

There is one you haven't convinced...

KELTNER

(gently)

You, Helmut... you!

STOUT PRISONER

Youngsters!  They've got youngsters

YOUNG PRISONER

ADOLF

Another fence!

HELMUT

What does it mean?  What do they

need a fence for?

KELTNER

Misery loves company.  Looks like

they're going to deny us even that.

GUARD

All right.  All right, move.  Hurry

it up.  Move.

LOUDSPEAKER

Attention!  The Commandant issues

the following special order:  the

north side of the camp is now

temporary quarters for non-Aryan

Aryan and non-Aryan prisoners is

strictly prohibited.  Any violation

GUARD

Prisoners from barracks H remain in

line.  Barracks H will remain in

line.

GUARD

I said last night I didn't think I

would enjoy being called up to account

for the noise coming from barracks

H.  I can tell you this morning I

didn't enjoy it.

GUARD

I don't know what caused the trouble

last night, but I'm not blaming you

entirely.

(fatherly)

I failed you.  I should have seen

that you all have much too much energy

for the confined life you lead here.

(he smiles benevolently)

GUARD

We're going to correct that.  I've

been told that energy comes from

food.

GUARD

So... to help you... all rations are

canceled for the next... forty-eight

hours.

GUARD

And, if that doesn't quiet you down,

I'll think of some other ideas you'll

like even less. I'm going to make

this barracks the quietest in the

camp.

(roaring)

Is that clear?

GUARD

Now, don't blame me.

(with sly meaning)

I didn't start the trouble last night.

GUARD

Fall out.

HERMAN

Bastard!

STOUT PRISONER

I can't go without food. I'll starve.

KELTNER

Helmut, don't.

GALT

(loudly)

He's the one we can thank for the

diet.

HELMUT

Sir?  Corporal...

GUARD

What?

HELMUT

(obsequiously)

Doork.  Helmut Doork.  Remember?

The papers... You said... Remember

the special forms for the Gestapo to

review my case.

GUARD

No papers.

GALT

What'd you say now, Mr. Doork,

Almighty!

(to men)

Last night he wouldn't give us a

laugh.  Today they won't give us

food.

LUDWIG

(venomously)

What were you doing?  Making a deal

with your guard pal to slip you some

food?

HELMUT

(indignantly)

No!  I was asking him about the forms

he'd promised to get me.

(admonishing)

Because of last night... I'm not

getting them.

KELTNER

(encouragingly)

When this blows over, Helmut, we'll...

LUDWIG

(interrupting)

Don't feel sorry for him.  He's got

no one to blame but himself.  The

whole thing was his doing.

ADOLF

He's been telling us how great he

is; how funny.  Why?  Why couldn't

he have done a trick or two for us?

UHLMANN

The Reverend did a turn.  What's so

special about him?

KELTNER

Don't start anything here.  We're in

enough trouble.

UHLMANN

We're not starting anything, we're

finishing something.

GALT

We've decided Doork here is going to

keep us laughing so hard we won't be

able to hear our stomachs growling.

STOUT PRISONER

Better hurry it up, clown.  'Cause

my stomach's growling already. Can

you hear it?

HERMAN

Hear it!  The whole place hears it.

MEN

Yeah, Doork, do a trick. How about

that night in Munich when they

wouldn't stop laughing.  How about

it, Doork? Come on, just a little

trick.  Give us one laugh.  That's

all we're asking for.  Come on,

Helmut, do something.

FRANZ

(excitedly)

He's going to do it!  He's going to

do it!

HELMUT

(grandly)

Nothing pleases an artist more than

to perform.  I'm going to do a real

show for you.  All I ask is that you

give me a little time...  time to

get things together...  things I can

use as props...  I'll even try to

make a costume, and...

ADOLF

You don't need a costume.  We've got

imagination.

(TO MEN)

Right?

HERMAN

Do the drunk pretzel like the kid

suggested last night.

GALT

(commanding)

And do it now, clown.  No more

stalling.

HELMUT

Let me through.

ADOLF

Aren't we good enough for you?

LUDWIG

He'd do his tricks fast enough if

his guard pal asked him.  Wouldn't

you, Doork?

KELTNER

Do something, Karl.  For God's sake,

do something.

GALT

And be sure it's funny.

GALT

(his face pressed

close to Helmut's)

You make us scream... scream with

laughter...  or I'll tear you to

shreds on the wire.

HELMUT

All right... all right.

MEN

If he's Germany's greatest clown,

God help the Fatherland.  Doork, the

Great!  You got paid for that?  To

go without food is bad enough, but

to have to watch that!

2ND NEW PRISONER

(accusingly)

You're not the clown I saw.  You

lied.  You're big all right.  A big

liar.

4TH NEW PRISONER

(contemptuously)

And I was going to tell my kids!

UHLMANN

He's no clown.  Not even a bad one.

HELMUT

I am.  I am a clown!

HELMUT

(continuing)

Give me a chance.  I just got started.

ADOLF

(sadly)

That's what we've been eating our

hearts out to see!

(a beat)

You stink.  You really stink.

HELMUT

I... I slipped.   I can do it.

HELMUT

I am a clown.   I am.  I am.

GALT

Doork the Great.

HELMUT

(screaming at top of

voice)

Come back, damn you, come back.  The

children... they're laughing.  They're

laughing.  I am a clown.  I am a

clown.

OLD PRISONER'S VOICE

Don't know how you can go without

shoes.  Soles of my feet are too

sensitive.

BIG PRISONER

It's my stomach that's sensitive.

OLD PRISONER

(looking o.s., smiles)

Here comes your second helping.

HELMUT

Here.

BIG PRISONER

How're the shoes?

HELMUT

Perfect.

HELMUT

Don't forget the bowl.

BIG PRISONER

(irked)

Hey, Doork!

BIG PRISONER

My shoes!

BIG PRISONER

I said you could use 'em, not ruin

'em.

HELMUT

I had to fix them this way...  for

the act, you know.  Wait till you

see how funny it is.

BIG PRISONER

Yeah.  But will I feel like laughing

when it gets cold!

HELMUT

Don't worry.

BIG PRISONER

Worry!  I'm the one who'll get frost

bitten toes, not you.

HELMUT

When I return them, they'll be like

new.  I promise.

BIG PRISONER

For what you've done to my shoes I

should get more food.

OLD PRISONER

He's got to have something to eat.

OLD PRISONER

(continuing)

If he gives you his other meal...

he'll starve to death.  Then you

won't get anything.

BIG PRISONER

(to Helmut)

Remember... you fix them before you

bring 'em back.

HELMUT

Promise.

BIG PRISONER'S VOICE

Doork!

FRANZ (IRRITATED)

I mean it this time.

KELTNER

Don't tell us.  Tell him.

FRANZ

What am I supposed to do? Use pins?

HERMAN

Who has a pin?

FRANZ

You can laugh.  He isn't always after

you for something.

KELTNER

No?

FRANZ

What's that?

KELTNER

Chalk.

FRANZ

What for?

KELTNER (SHRUGS)

Says he can mash it into a powder

and put it on his face.

HERMAN

Where'd you get it?

KELTNER

From a guard.

KELTNER

(lowers his voice)

A very bad Nazi.  Still has a heart.

FRANZ

I wish he'd have a heart and use

someone else's coat. Or better yet --

his own.

KELTNER

(looking o.s. and

nodding)

Ask him.

KELTNER

Finally got it.

KELTNER

(a little annoyed)

Isn't that what you wanted?

HELMUT

(holding up the chalk)

This will do more for the act than

anything.  Wait'll you see!

KELTNER

(a sigh of relief)

For a moment there you had me worried.

FRANZ

(indicating bread

Helmut's nibbling on)

I see you got smart.

HELMUT

His conscience bothered him.

KELTNER

I thought he would kill you when he

saw what you had done to his shoes.

HELMUT

(sheepishly)

So did I.

FRANZ

I don't know what I'm laughing at...

look at what he's doing to my coat.

(holds it up)

Look at it!  Yesterday a button off.

HELMUT

(firmly)

I've got to have it.  It is the only

one I can get on and still is tight

enough to look funny.

FRANZ

At the rate you are tearing it up,

it's going to look a lot funnier.

KELTNER

Give in, Franz.  You know he's going

to talk you out of it again.

HELMUT

I'll be careful.  I swear. Besides,

I've got to have it. I explained

before...  a clown can't change his

costume.  It's his trademark.

FRANZ

I know... I know... but...

GALT

(interrupting)

Why should he give it to a Jew clown?

Right, kid?

FRANZ

That's got nothing to do with it.

GALT

What's the matter with you bastards

anyway?  All he ever did for us was

cause trouble, but for them...

(nodding toward the

other side)

... he can't do enough.

(a beat)

I say he's one of them.

KELTNER

(coolly)

If he were, he'd be over there

GALT

That's where he belongs.

FRANZ

What're you so hot about?  It's no

skin off your...

UHLMANN

(cutting in)

We've got a good reason for not liking

them.

GALT

If it wasn't for them... we wouldn't

be in here.

HERMAN

What'd you mean?

UHLMANN

A bunch of them got picked up with

papers we'd sold them.   And what'd

they do?  Turn us in, they did.  The

ungrateful...

KELTNER

So that was it!  Counterfeit papers.

I can imagine the prices.

GALT

Supply and demand, Reverend.  Supply

and demand.

FRANZ

Take it, Doork -- anytime you want

it.

UHLMANN

What's so terrible about what we

did?  Lot of them got out of the

country with our papers.  They were

damn good counterfeits.

GALT

(calling to Keltner,

very proudly)

And what's more, we never charged

for children.  Never.

KELTNER

I've been meaning to ask you.  Heard

anymore about the request for a review

of your case?

HELMUT

Did you hear the laughs I got

yesterday?

HELMUT

Not just from the children... but

the adults, too.

KELTNER

Never thought of that.

HELMUT

They said I couldn't come up with

anything new.

HELMUT

At the circus.  Schmidt and the rest.

Wait'll they see my act now.  It's

funny.  Really funny.

(a beat)

Isn't it?

KELTNER

The children certainly enjoy it.

HELMUT

What I needed was time.  Time to

concentrate on new material.  A man's

got to have time alone.

KELTNER

(glancing around)

You call this being alone?

HELMUT

Do you think... maybe... they'd let

me go to other camps and entertain?

HELMUT

I'd have to get to the Commandant.

Would need his permission.

HELMUT

If you have time later, I'd like you

to see something I've been working

on.  I hunch down and do a tiny

soldier parading.  Think they'll

like it?

KELTNER

(pointedly)

Who?  The adults?

HELMUT

(matter of fact)

The children, of course.

KELTNER

I thought the smart clown only played

to the adults.

inner office as he

passes Scharff)

BESTLER

(continuing)

Come in.

CUT TO:

BESTLER

Oh, stand at ease.  And, close the

door.

BESTLER

I don't have to tell you why your

Commandant was relieved of his command

here. This prison is a disgrace.

Disgrace! The latitude allowed by

him will not be tolerated by me.

Understand?

BESTLER

That includes the staff.  I'm going

to turn this place into a model

prison, a credit to the Reich.

Understand?

BESTLER

Speak up.

SCHARFF

Yes, Colonel.

BESTLER

This isn't the first prison the SS

has had to take over from the

military. Military men are too soft

to deal with those...

(he nods toward the

window)

Scharff starts to speak but quickly

changes his mind.

SCHARFF

Yes, sir.

BESTLER

You were about to say something?

SCHARFF

Oh... I... was just going to say

that I didn't hold with the soft

treatment of the prisoners.

BESTLER

Good!

(taking papers from

folder)

Our first order of business is to

prepare...

BESTLER

Our first order of business is to

prepare all non-Aryan prisoners for

shipment in two weeks.

SCHARFF

Where are they being sent, Colonel?

BESTLER

Work camps.

SCHARFF

(speaking a little

louder)

But we have about 40 children, some

only babies, with more scheduled to

arrive tomorrow or the next day.

They're not going to be much use in

a work camp.

BESTLER

(his attention diverted

back to Scharff)

I'm aware of that.  This order covers

only the adult prisoners over fifteen.

We won't have to wet nurse the

children for long.  Other plans are

being made for...

BESTLER

What is that?

BESTLER

What is that supposed to be?

SCHARFF

That!  Well, you see, sir, one of

the prisoners used to be a circus

clown.  Sometimes he gives a little...

well...  a sort of show -- for the

children.

BESTLER

(turning away from

window)

A show!  Is this a prison camp or a

traveling circus!

(he looks out window

again)

Am I correct in assuming that those

children are on the non-Aryan side

of the camp?

SCHARFF

(almost in whisper)

Yes, sir.

BESTLER

(leaving window)

And the... buffoon?  A German?

SCHARFF

Yes, Colonel.

BESTLER

Am I to believe you aren't aware of

the general order absolutely

forbidding fraternization?

SCHARFF

(not worried)

I know about it, sir.

BESTLER

Close the window.

BESTLER

Just what do you think fraternization

means, Lieutenant Scharff ?

SCHARFF

Communication.   Social contact.

Giving aid, talking...

(shrugs helplessly)

BESTLER

How long has this been going on?

SCHARFF

Just the last two or three weeks.

BESTLER

And the Commandant approved?

SCHARFF

Well, sir, children are very hard to

handle.

BESTLER

This clown!  Who is he?

SCHARFF

(trying hard to

remember)

It's... I know.  It's Doork, the

Great.

BESTLER

Not his clown name, you idiot.  His

number.  His identification.

SCHARFF

If I have the Colonel's permission

to leave, I will check it at once.

BESTLER

Later.  Right now I want these

performances halted.  Understand?

SCHARFF

Yes, sir.

BESTLER

(shouting)

Immediately!

SCHARFF

Yes, sir !

GUARD

(shouting)

That's all.  Show's over.  Everybody

clear out.

HELMUT

What's wrong?

GUARD

Get back to the barrack.

You heard me.  Show's over.

GUARD

Go on.  Get away.

GUARD

Move, damn it, before I come over

there and...

GUARD

Get them moving before somebody gets

hurt.

HELMUT

That's all the show for today.  Go

back inside.

HELMUT

That's right now, go along.  I'll

see you tomorrow.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.

Until tomorrow.

GUARD

Get inside and take that stuff off

your face.

HELMUT

I don't understand.  What's the

matter?

GUARD

Orders.  No more shows.

HELMUT

You mean... not ever?

GUARD

That's right.

HELMUT

But we weren't doing any harm.

GUARD

The Commandant thinks you are.

HELMUT

The Commandant?

GUARD

The new Commandant.  He minds.

HELMUT

Just because I make them laugh a

little...

GUARD

You know the rule... no mixing with

Jews.

HELMUT

I wasn't mixing!  I was only...

GUARD

(quietly, threatening)

Look, it's not my order.  It's the

Commandant's.

(more kindly)

Now do what I tell you and save

yourself a lot of grief.

FRANZ

What happened?

HELMUT

(still bewildered)

He says I've got to stop -- with the

children.

KELTNER

(nodding)

I've been expecting it.

LUDWIG

Because they're Jews?

KELTNER

Because of the laughing.

HELMUT

Why should that bother them?

KELTNER

When you rule by fear, laughter is

the most frightening sound in the

world.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

HELMUT

I can't go out there.  I can't take

another day of them staring at me.

KELTNER

They'll get over it.  Disappointment

HELMUT

They look at me as though it was all

my fault.  Haven't they been told

why I can't...

KELTNER

I'm sure they have.

HELMUT

Then why do they stare?

KELTNER

(holding up the plant)

It's amazing how a thing like this

can feed off itself.  Think how lucky

we would be if we could do that.

HELMUT

I sewed a button on.  Look all right?

KELTNER

(inspecting coat)

Fine.

HELMUT

I did make them laugh.  Didn't I?

HELMUT

(angrily)

I wish they'd get them out of here.

Prison is no place for little

children.

KELTNER

We've been all over that before.

You've got to stop thinking about

them.

HELMUT

(trying to convince

himself)

You're right!  I've got to think of

myself.

KELTNER

It's too hot in here.  I'm going to

get some air.

HELMUT

Johann... do you think there's any

possible way I could talk to the

Commandant.  Maybe I could make him

understand...

KELTNER

There's nothing you can do... but

forget.

HELMUT

How can I!  They were my own very

special audience.  And now they stare

at me as if I had betrayed them.

KELTNER

They're children, Helmut.  You can't

expect them to understand the madness

of adults.

HELMUT

(sudden thought)

If I could talk to them.  To the

children themselves -- that would

help, wouldn't it?

HELMUT

If I explain it to them -- then

they'll know I am not mad at them.

KELTNER

(very deliberately)

You go near that fence once again...

and you're taking your life in your

own hands.  You know that as well as

I do.

HELMUT

(pleading)

I would just need a minute.  A minute

to talk to them.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HELMUT

I wish to God I didn't care.  I wish

to God I could forget them.

HELMUT

But I can't.

KELTNER

I'm going to ask you a question,

Helmut, and I want you to think

carefully before you answer.

KELTNER

The reason you can't get them out of

your mind -- is it because you need

them -- for you audience?

KELTNER

I want the truth.

HELMUT

(after a moment)

I know I can't perform for them

anymore.  I know that.

(a beat)

I really don't know what the reason

is.  I think it's got something to

do with... well, I don't want those

little ones to think I've turned

against them, too.  That's why I've

got to do something.  Something.

KELTNER

You'll be taking a chance.  A great

chance.

KELTNER

(very definite)

All right!  Come on then.

HELMUT

Where are you going?

KELTNER

You want to talk to the children?

Well, I think I can help you.

HELMUT

There's no reason for you to get

involved in this.

KELTNER

Reason?  When war is waged against

children!  That is reason enough for

the whole damn world to get involved.

And it will, believe me, it will.

KELTNER

So, come on, Doork the Great, let's

start getting involved.

CUT TO:

KELTNER

Wait here.

LUDWIG

(low to Galt)

Kessler is going to talk to the

children. Cover him.

GALT

(mean)

Who says so?

LUDWIG

(evenly)

The Reverend says cover him... so we

cover him.

GALT

All right!  I was just asking.

KELTNER

You know what to do?

KELTNER

Stay behind the men and keep an eye

out for the guards on the other side.

HELMUT

Right.

KELTNER

Make it quick.  You won't have much

time.

KELTNER

And Helmut, keep the children quiet.

We don't want trouble.

HELMUT

(shouting)

Kick it, Ludwig.  Kick it!

CHILDREN

Doork, Doork, Doork is back.  It's

Doork.  It's Doork.

HELMUT

Shhh.  Shhhh.  The guards...

CHILDREN

Do a trick, Doork.  Please, Doork,

please, please.

HELMUT

No, no.  I can't.  The guards won't

let me.  Not now.  Maybe some other

day.

LITTLE GIRL

They're bad.

HELMUT

What is it?  What happened?

LITTLE GIRL

He hurt himself.

HELMUT

Shhh.  Shhh.  Don't cry.  It's going

to be all right.

(to the other children)

Be careful when you're near this

fence.

HELMUT

Here, wrap this around it.  I'll

make it all better.

HELMUT

(worried)

Hush now.  Stop crying.  Please.

Look... Look at this.

HELMUT

There, that's better.  No more crying

now.

HELMUT

What's the matter with them?

LITTLE GIRL

They're new.  We can't understand

them.  All they do is cry.

OLDER BOY

They're all the way from

Czechoslovakia.

HELMUT

(to the silent ones)

There's nothing to be afraid of.

Everything is all right.

ADOLF

(a hushed call)

Hurry up.

HELMUT

Here.  Look.  I'll show you... No

noise now.

HELMUT

No, no, be quiet.  Be quiet.  Shhh.

Shhhh.

GUARD

You wouldn't listen, would you?

GUARD

(to the children)

Go on.  Get back.

GUARD

You back there, get them out of here.

HELMUT

They had nothing to do with it.  It

was all my doing.

FIRST SS OFFICER

Get up.

KELTNER

The children! Not in front of the

children!

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

BESTLER

(on phone)

Yes.

(pause)

Yes.  Yes, I understand perfectly.

However, I don't see how we can be

held responsible.

(pause)

Our orders were very clear.  We were

to have the freight car ready to be

picked up at midnight.

(pause)

Of course, I'm aware the operation

must be kept secret.

(pause)

I just don't have the staff to send

down there now and... Yes, I'll wait.

BESTLER

The freight car wasn't picked up.

SCHARFF

It's still down there on the siding!

BESTLER

Some stupid mix up.  If they think...

BESTLER

Yes, General.

(pause)

Yes, I'm as distressed about the

situation as you are.

(long pause during

which he nods his

head)

Yes.  Personally!  Immediately!

Yes, General.  You can leave it in

my hands.

(pause)

Heil Hitler!

BESTLER

Who did you leave in charge down

there?

SCHARFF

Sergeant Hoffman.  Very reliable.

BESTLER

Apparently not reliable enough.  The

cargo seems to be raising quite a

fuss.

SCHARFF

(explanatory)

Fifty children, sir!  In a boxcar!

BESTLER

I know.  I know.  But the siding

isn't far from town.  The General

doesn't want unauthorized persons

getting curious.  Understand?

SCHARFF

I'll get some men down there right

away.

BESTLER

Men!  You'll get yourself down there.

And take at least a dozen guards

with you.  Don't let anyone get close

to that boxcar...  under any

circumstances.  No one !

SCHARFF

Yes, sir.

SCHARFF

Sir?

SCHARFF

I wondered, sir, if you might have

any suggestions as... well...  how

do we quiet children?

BESTLER

Use any method you can, but shut

them up.  That's an order.

SCHARFF

Sir, the clown!

SCHARFF

The one who amused the children

BESTLER

Out of the question.  The man's being

disciplined for that very thing.  We

can't change our position now.

SCHARFF

No one need know.

BESTLER

He'd know.

SCHARFF

Sir, if I could guarantee he'd never

say anything.

SCHARFF

You see, sir, he's been trying to

get a review of his case.  Claims

he's here by mistake.  I could tell

him you would recommend the review.

BESTLER

A man who wants something.  Good.

Very good strategy, Lieutenant.

(he turns to face

Scharff)

However, when you bring him back

here, return him to solitary and

keep him there.

(a beat)

I've seen the best of men, after

several years in solitary, unable to

remember even their own names.

SCHARFF

Then I have your permission to take

the clown.

BESTLER

Permission granted.

DISSOLVE TO:

HELMUT

Wish you could've gotten the big

shoes.  The children laugh so when

they see them flopping up and down.

HELMUT

(a touch of the old

arrogance)

The Commandant, himself, asked for

me!

(a beat)

You say he's personally requesting a

review of my case!  Why, that means

I'm practically on my way back to

Berlin.

(studies mouth in

mirror)

Should be red.  Mouth looks better

in red.

(a beat)

Know the first thing I'm going to do

when I get to Berlin?  Buy an overcoat

with a fur collar.  Had such a coat.

Very elegant. Very elegant.

(finishing the up-

turned corners of

mouth)

It's a good idea... moving the

children.

HELMUT

Prison's no place for children. I

said all along that it was some kind

of mistake.

SCHARFF

(uncomfortable)

Finish your makeup.  We're almost

there.

HELMUT

Know what Johann Keltner said?

SCHARFF

Who?

HELMUT

Keltner.  From my barracks.  The

minister. He said... Let me think.

He said... men who wage war on

children. That's it. Men who wage

war on children... commit such a

crime...

(a beat as he thinks)

... such a heinous crime.  That's

it.  Men who wage war on children

commit such a heinous crime that

even the devil damns their souls.

SCHARFF

(to Helmut in car)

Wait here.

SCHARFF

Any word about the train yet?

HOFFMAN

No, sir.  The last we heard -- it

won't get here until evening.

SCHARFF

Anyone been around?

HOFFMAN

No, sir.

SCHARFF

With all that wailing, it's a wonder.

Couldn't you keep them quiet?

HOFFMAN

I didn't know what to do, Lieutenant.

I was afraid to close both doors.

SCHARFF

(to other soldiers)

Keep a tight guard on the whole area.

No one gets near here.  Understand?

(to Hoffman)

You post them.

HOFFMAN

(saluting)

Yes, sir.

SCHARFF

(to soldier holding

the sack)

Leave that here.

SCHARFF

(calling to Helmut)

Over here, Clown.

HELMUT

They're crying.

SCHARFF

(indicating the sack)

Take that in to them.

HELMUT

What is it?

SCHARFF

Bread.  They won't wait so loud with

their mouths full.

HELMUT

(shocked)

How... how long have they been here?

SCHARFF

You just get in there and keep them

quiet.  You can do that, can't you?

SCHARFF

Do a good job and I'll personally

ask that you get a favorable decision

on your case.  Understand?

HELMUT

Yes, sir.

OLDER GIRL

(tentatively)

Doork?

(shrill with

recognition)

It's Doork.  It is!  It is!

HELMUT

(gently)

So this is where you've been hiding?

BOY

I want to go home.  Take me home.

HELMUT

Now, now, there's nothing to cry

about.  We're going to have fun.

(disengaging himself

and picking up the

sack)

Here.  I brought you something.

(he tosses it into

the car)

The children pounce on the sack and

tug at it, unsure what it is except

that it's a gift from Helmut.

HELMUT

Wait now.  Don't open it yet.  Wait'll

I get in.  You help me.

HELMUT

Look, I'm a Jack-in-the-box.

HELMUT

We're all Jacks-in-the-box -- the

same box.

HELMUT

Well... who's hungry.

HELMUT

All right, I want everybody to sit

down.  When I count three, everybody

sit.  Ready?   One, two...

HELMUT

Oh, you're too fast.  Three!

HELMUT

Now... what'll we do?

LITTLE GIRL

I want to see my Mommy.

HELMUT

You would?  All right.

LITTLE GIRL

You know where she is?

HELMUT

She's right here with you.

LITTLE GIRL

I don't see her.

HELMUT

That's because you don't know how to

look.  I'll show you.  Close your

eyes.

(to the other children)

All of you... close your eyes.

HELMUT

Everybody's eyes shut?  Now, think

about your mommys and Daddys... There,

don't you see them?  Can't you see

their faces?

HELMUT

So you see!  They're right here with

you.  All you have to do is look in

your hearts.

LITTLE GIRL

(putting her hand

over her heart)

Does Mommy see me, Doork?

HELMUT

(deeply touched)

Yes, she does.  She has you safe in

her heart, too.

HELMUT

I've got an idea.  You all know my

name, but I don't know yours.  So

let's find out everybody's name,

shall we?

HELMUT

You... come here and I'll show you

what we'll do.

HELMUT

What's your name?

BOY

(timidly)

Willie.

HELMUT

Willie.  That's a good name.  How do

you spell it?

BOY

W-I-L-L-I-E.

HELMUT

Fine.  I'll just write that on top

of your head.

HELMUT

There.  See, this way we'll all be

able to tell everybody else's name

just by looking at his head.

BOY

Did you really?

HELMUT

Of course I did.  Here...

HELMUT

(to the older boy)

Tell him what it says.

OLDER BOY

(giggling)

It says Willie.

BOY

(impressed)

Really?  Truly?

HELMUT

Be careful.  Don't smear it.

(he glances around)

Let's see now... Yes.  You shall be

next.

HELMUT

What is your name?

HELMUT

(squatting down beside

her)

Forgive me.  I don't speak your

language.

HELMUT

(to others)

See!  We understand each other.

Now...

(he points to Willie)

Willie.

(he points to himself)

Doork.

(points again to Willie)

Willie.

(pointing to himself)

Doork.

HELMUT

A beautiful name!  Now you tell all

the children.

CZECH GIRL

(almost a whisper)

Inga.

HELMUT

It's such a pretty name... say it

again.

CZECH GIRL

(more sure of herself)

Inga!

HELMUT

(with a flourish of

his pencil)

I-N-G-A.  There it is.

HELMUT

Let's see now.  Who wants to be next.

HELMUT

You?

HELMUT

Her?

LITTLE GIRL

So the little children will know her

name.

HELMUT

Of course.  That way she can't get

lost, can she?  What's her name?

LITTLE GIRL

Frederika.

HELMUT

(mock dismay)

Frederika?

HELMUT

Frederika!

HELMUT

Couldn't we just make it Freda?

LITTLE GIRL

(solemnly)

Oh, no!  Frederika.

DISSOLVE TO:

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

(whispering)

Clown.  Clown, can you play one of

these?

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

I got it to send home to my boy...

but if it'll help...

HELMUT

It will.  It will.

(he takes it)

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

You won't say anything to the

Lieutenant.

HELMUT

I promise.

HELMUT

Guard... guard.

HELMUT

It's going to be dark soon.  The

little ones may be afraid.  Do you

think... well... could you get some

kind of a light for in here?

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

(angry)

Want to get me in trouble?

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

(trying to justify

himself)

I would if I could.

HELMUT

I know.  I know you would.

HELMUT

(gently)

What's the matter?

(she only stares at

him)

It's all right -- just a bad dream.

OLDER GIRL

Doork.

OLDER GIRL

Where are they sending us?

HELMUT

(shaking his head)

Don't know.

OLDER GIRL

Do you have children?

HELMUT

I do now.

DISSOLVE TO:

SCHARFF

It finally got here.

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

Yes, sir.

SCHARFF

Help them get the car coupled on.

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

(calling)

All right, clown, time to get off.

HELMUT

What is it?

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

Train is here.  They are hooking it

up now.

(he hoists the lantern

inside)

Here.  Tell them not to light it up

until the doors are closed.

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

(curtly)

And get off right now.

CHILDREN

We're moving.  What's happening?

What was the noise?  Doork, where

are we going?

HELMUT

(forced gaiety)

It's nothing.  You're going for a

train ride.  What do you think of

that?  A real train ride.

CHILDREN

(pressing close --

sensing his anxiety)

Is it far?  Are you coming, too?  I

don't want a train ride.

HELMUT

Oh, it'll be fun.  I would like to

come, but I don't think I can.

CHILDREN

(pleading)

Please come, Doork.  Please.  Please.

Please.

HELMUT

I can't.  They want me to stay here.

HELMUT

But... I'll come to see you.  Soon

as I can. And, I want you all to

promise me to be very good.  No

crying.

HELMUT

If you want me...  remember, just

close your eyes.

HELMUT

(huskily)

Goodbye.

HELMUT

What's this now?  Crying?  After all

the fun we've had?

GIRL

It's his birthday.  He thought there

would be presents.

HELMUT

(to girl)

He's a Czech.   Do you speak...

GIRL

(annoyed)

Of course not!

HELMUT

(pointedly)

Then how do you know it's his...

birthday?

GIRL

(with typical child

logic)

He told me.

HELMUT

He speaks German?

GIRL

No.

HELMUT

But he told you it's his birthday?

HELMUT

What date is this?

GIRL

(after thinking it

over)

Why, it's his birthday!

GIRL

Don't you believe him?

HELMUT

Of course, I do.

(pats boy's head)

Tell him I wish him a happy birthday.

GIRL

He knows that.  But... but what're

you going to do about a present?

HELMUT

Aha, the very thing.  He can be the

clown while I'm gone.

HELMUT

Happy birthday.

GERMAN BOY

He's a boy!  Dolls are for girls.

HELMUT

When you give something you love...

it doesn't matter if it's the right

thing.

HELMUT

Maybe we have time for a birthday

game.  A quick one.  Let me take a

look.

HELMUT

Everybody line up behind me now, and

I'll show you how a train goes.

Wait -- the harmonica.

HELMUT

May I borrow it back... for just a

minute or two?

HELMUT

For just a minute -- then I'll give

it right back to you.

(trying a sort of

sign language)

Just for the game.

HELMUT

Good.  Now everybody...  line up

behind me.

HELMUT

Grab hold of the one in front of

you...  'cause we're going to be a

fast express train.

HELMUT

(calling out)

All aboard.  All aboard.

CUT TO:

HELMUT

WAIT!

HELMUT

Open the door!  Let me out...  LET

ME OUT!

HELMUT

Guess I'm going with you after all.

CHILD

Let's play some more, Doork?

CUT TO:

SCHARFF

I'm glad that's over.  Call in the

sentries.

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

Yes, sir.

SCHARFF

Kessler in the car?

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

Kessler?

SCHARFF

The clown?

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

(looking around)

I... I guess he is, sir.

SCHARFF

You GUESS!

SCHARFF

(moving back toward

Hoffman)

I told you to get him off the train.

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

I told him, sir.  HE was standing

right by the door.  I'm sure he got

off.

SCHARFF

Did you see him?

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

Why, I...

SCHARFF

DID you?

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

You told me to see that the car was

coupled on.  When I came back...

Why wouldn't he get off?

SCHARFF

Idiot!

(shouting)

Guards.  GUARDS!

SCHARFF

The clown prisoner is missing.  He

may have escaped.  Search the area.

If he got off the train he must be

around here someplace.

SCHARFF

You know what happens if he gets

away.

SERGEANT HOFFMAN

(hopefully)

He can't get very far.

SCHARFF

If he's on that train -- he's going

farther than you know ---

CUT TO:

SCHARFF

... or he knows.

DISSOLVE TO:

CHILDREN

What is it?  Are we there, Doork?

Where are we?  Why are we stopping?

HELMUT

I don't know.

BURLY GUARD

Everybody up.  No noise.

BURLY GUARD

Who the hell are you?

HELMUT

Where are we?

BURLY GUARD

How the devil did you get in here?

HELMUT

I... I'm from the other prison.  Got

locked in -- by accident.

BURLY GUARD

Ah, for...

(shouting out the

door)

Sergeant!

CUT TO:

SERGEANT

What's the matter?

BURLY GUARD

Look at this.  He's from the other

camp.  Got in here with the shipment.

SERGEANT

How did that happen?

HELMUT

I... I was taking care of the children

back there and... accidentally got

locked in.

SERGEANT

Of all the... What's your name?

HELMUT

(realizing he's in

big trouble)

Doork.  Helmut Doork.

SERGEANT

(to the guard)

Put him in the truck with the others.

And, let's get going.

CUT TO:

BURLY GUARD

(to the children)

All right, in the truck, quick now!

BURLY GUARD

I said move!

HELMUT

(quickly)

Wait.  Let me.

(to the children)

Everybody up.  Come on.  Up, up, up.

SERGEANT

(to Helmut)

Not you.

HELMUT

Don't you want me to stay with them?

They'll be frightened without me.

BURLY GUARD

Not for long, they won't.

SERGEANT

(to guard)

That's enough.  Get them inside and

keep them quiet.

BURLY GUARD

(threateningly)

MOVE!

HELMUT

Do as he says.  And, don't worry,

I'll be with you soon.  I promise.

SERGEANT

(to Helmut)

Come along, now.

HELMUT

This is just another prison.

SERGEANT

What'd you expect?

HELMUT

I thought the children were going to

a better place.

RUNKEL

(over shoulder to

guard at door)

Close the door, and wait out there.

RUNKEL

You're a remarkable man.  Very

remarkable.

RUNKEL

Have you any idea where you are?

RUNKEL

Auschwitz.  This is Auschwitz.

(a beat)

Mean anything to you?

(before Helmut can

answer)

You may have observed we're enlarging

our facilities.

RUNKEL

Still a great deal of work to be

done.

(proudly)

It's going to be our most efficient,

most modern prison.

(he turns and smiles)

And, I might add, most unique.

(walks back towards

Helmut, studying him

carefully)

RUNKEL

Yes, you are a remarkable man.  I

always wonder about remarkable men.

(then evenly)

Why did you come here?

HELMUT

I explained.  I got locked in the

boxcar and...

RUNKEL

(cuts in - still bland)

Ah, yes.  An accident.  Unavoidable

I suppose.

HELMUT

I was taking care -- I mean, the

Commandant requested me to take care

of the children.

RUNKEL

(a slight note of

mockery)

The Commandant!

RUNKEL

I've spoken to YOUR Commandant.  He

hs you listed as an escaped prisoner.

HELMUT

Escaped!  But...

RUNKEL

(finishing it for him)

... it was an accident.

(his face close to

Helmut's)

Are you one of them, clown?

HELMUT

(terrorized at the

thought of death)

No... no!  I'm not one of them.  I'm

not !

RUNKEL

You misunderstand completely.  The

Judas goat is never killed.  He isn't

worth killing.

(moves to cell door)

I'm just asking you to lead them.

RUNKEL

Not... even to save your own life?

RUNKEL

(victorious)

I'm glad to see you're not a self-

appointed martyr.

RUNKEL

Just think!  Now you're really one

of us.

HELMUT

(attempting to get to

his feet)

Sir... Sir... could I... could I

have a little time with them before

... before...

RUNKEL

Yes.  Yes, of course.

(he looks at his watch)

I can give you about half an hour.

(a little smile lights

his face)

You see, we're not heartless men

here.

DISSOLVE TO:

SERGEANT

Remember what I told you.

HELMUT

There won't be any trouble.

CUT TO:

CHILDREN

Doork, Doork, you came back.  You

came back.  We thought you'd left

us.  Don't leave us, Doork.

HELMUT

There.  There.  It's all right. It's

all right.   Everything is going to

be all right.

HELMUT

Now I want everyone to put on a big

smile and sit down, because we're

going to have more fun than we've

ever had.

HELMUT

Good.  We'll start by seeing that we

all have our names on our heads.

HELMUT

(as he moves among

them)

Yes, yes.  There's Fritz, Maria,

Sadie, Inga, Josef, Nathan, Helga,

Willie...

HELMUT

Ah, yes, Frederika!  Good.  I see

all of your names.

HELMUT

Now... on with the show.  Just watch

this.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

Doork!  Doork... you're great !

SERGEANT

(to Helmut)

It's time.

HELMUT

Just a few more minutes?

HELMUT

I'll bring them.

CHILDREN

What's the matter, Doork?  Where are

we going?  You come with us this

time.  Where're they taking us.

HELMUT

(trying to think what

to say)

They... they want us to move to

another building... where we'll have

more room... to play.

(a beat)

Tell you what.  Let's make it a big

circus parade.  Everybody get in a

line behind...

HELMUT

(continuing)

... behind Willie here.

HELMUT

Now, where's our band?  The harmonica?
