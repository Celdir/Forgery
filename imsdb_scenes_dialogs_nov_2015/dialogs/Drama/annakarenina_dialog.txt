LEVIN

Good girl . . . good girl, Pava.

KITCHEN MAID

(ARRIVING)

Agafia Mishaylovna says dinner's like to

spoil.

LEVIN

. . . her father's colour.

VASILI

Worth coming home for, Konstantin

Dmitrich!

LEVIN

I stayed too long in Moscow.

4

LEVIN

. . . She's a beauty. That's twelve cows sired

by Berkut!

AGAFIA

So one of you is doing what the good Lord

made you for.

MATVEY

What should I do with this?

OBLONSKY

Where did you find it?

MATVEY

In your hat. Your Excellency.

OBLONSKY

Yes . . . I picked it up somewhere for Daria

Alexandrovna and the children.

OBLONSKY

My Tanruchoshka! Mind my cigar.

OBLONSKY (CONT'D)

Be good today. I'm off.

Read the chapter carefully. I'll come back to

TIME--DAY

9

ANNA

Tsk, oh . . . Stiva!

ANNA

. . . and Dolly found a note from the

governess.

10

KARENIN

Well . . . ?

ANNA

Stiva wants me to come to Moscow . . . to

persuade Dolly to forgive him.

KARENIN

I'm to be deprived of my wife so that adul-

tery may be forgiven? I can't excuse him

just because he's your brother.

ANNA

It's for Dolly's sake too.

KARENIN

(has to go)

I have four committees today . . .

KARENIN (CONT'D)

Good, good!--I have the world waiting

for me, there's never time to look at your

exercises!

11

LUKICH

Sergei Alexeyich is doing very well, Your

Excellency.

ANNA

(a button missing)

Tsk-tsk, who put this shirt on you? Never

mind. I'll come and hear you read.

KARENIN

Tomorrow, perhaps. Thank you, Lukich--

perhaps tomorrow.

ANNA

Alexei, do you think nine years of mar-

riage and children should count for nothing

against a . . . an infatuation?

KARENIN

No. Very well.

(kisses her hand)

But sin has a price, you may be sure of that.

HOUSE--DAY

12

OBLONSKY

(PITEOUSLY)

Dolly . . . please think of the children . . .

DOLLY

You think of the children! Their lives are

ruined now!

TIME--DAY

OBLONSKY

Oh, Dolly . . . I beg you . . .

MATVEY

Telegram. Should I send up the barber?

OBLONSKY

No, just the razor.

13

MATVEY

Don't worry, sir, things will shape them-

selves, you'll see.

OBLONSKY

(RELIEVED)

My sister Anna's coming tomorrow. We're

saved.

DOORKEEPER

Some man came without an appointment,

Your Excellency . . . waiting outside.

OBLONSKY

Levin! Where did you disappear?

LEVIN

(NERVOUS)

I'm very anxious to see you. I need your

advice.

14

OBLONSKY

Well, then, come into my room.

OBLONSKY (CONT'D)

This is my oldest friend, Konstantin Dmit-

rich Levin! Someone send word I'll be a few

minutes late.

OBLONSKY

I've been hard at it. Sit down.

LEVIN

Hard at what exactly?

OBLONSKY

Why, we're overwhelmed with work!

LEVIN

Oh--paperwork.

OBLONSKY

Paperwork is the soul of Russia. Farming

is only the stomach. When am I going to

come and shoot some snipe?

15

OBLONSKY (CONT'D)

LEVIN

OBLONSKY

(rolls his eyes comically)

LEVIN

OBLONSKY

LEVIN

OBLONSKY

LEVIN

16

OBLONSKY

(HESITATES)

We'd better have dinner together.

Come on, we'll meet later at l'Angleterre.

Or do you prefer the Hermitage?

OBLONSKY

No--five-thirty at l'Angleterre--I owe them

more than the Hermitage, so it wouldn't be

fair to withdraw my custom.

(taking his hat)

Boots, and a coat. And a proper hat.

17

NIGHT

OBLONSKY

It's so unfair. You marry for love, you're

a good husband. Children arrive. Years

depart. And all of a sudden your wife is

tired, her hair is thin, her body . . . while

you yourself still have your . . . vigour . . .

and you find yourself distracted by a pretty

woman . . .

LEVIN

Forgive me, but I find that incomprehen-

sible . . . As though I'd leave this restaurant

and steal a roll from a baker's shop.

OBLONSKY

Well, you know, a freshly baked roll . . .

LEVIN

But I'm talking about love, and you're talk-

ing about . . . your appetite.

OBLONSKY

Easily confused. Now look, do you know

Count Vronsky?

LEVIN

Who? No. Why?

18

OBLONSKY

He's your rival. He turned up from St.

Petersburg after you left.

LEVIN

(AGHAST)

Who is he?

OBLONSKY

(CHANGING TACK)

You don't have to worry about him. He's

one of those rich, good-looking cavalry offi-

cers who've got nothing to do but make love

to pretty women . . .

OBLONSKY (CONT'D)

Cabbage soup?

ELDERLY WAITER

Potage aux choux a la Russe, as the gentle-

man ordered.

LEVIN

It's what I wanted.

LEVIN (CONT'D)

(ANGRY)

Understand that for me, tonight is a ques-

tion of life and death.

19

OBLONSKY

Oh, Kostya! Kitty would be mad to refuse

you. And Dolly is on your side, you know.

She says her sister Kitty was always meant

to be your wife and will be.

LEVIN

Dolly said that? I've always thought your

Dolly's a gem.

OBLONSKY

Oh, she is, she is . . .

(THOUGHTFULLY)

I loved her to distraction.

SEROZHA

But why?

20

ANNA

Because that's where Aunt Dolly lives.

SEROZHA

But why?

ANNA

(PATIENTLY)

I told you, Serozha. She's not well. I must

go to see her.

SEROZHA

But why?

ANNA

Now, don't make Mama cry. I'll be back

before you know, and bring you a present.

SEROZHA

Don't want a present. I want you to stay.

ANNA

Oh . . . my little Kutik . . .

SEROZHA

What present?

ANNA

That's better.

21

ANNA

It's the first time I've left my little boy.

COUNTESS VRONSKY

So you are leaving your son and I am return-

ing to mine. I am Countess Vronsky.

countess vronsky (cont'd)

I've been in St. Petersburg for the christen-

ing of a granddaughter--my elder son mar-

ried Princess Chirkov. You're a charming

creature. Why don't I know you?

22

ANNA

I've never been in Moscow society, really.

COUNTESS VRONSKY

But you know my name?

ANNA

I've heard you mentioned . . .

COUNTESS VRONSKY

Talked about, you mean. Ah, love!

ANNA

Was it love?

COUNTESS VRONSKY

Always. My sons are ashamed of me. But I'd

rather end up wishing I hadn't than end up

wishing I had--wouldn't you?

ANNA

I . . . I don't know . . .

23

SAME TIME--NIGHT

LEVIN

I'll come back.

UP ABOVE

KITTY

Konstantin!

LEVIN

I'm too early.

KITTY

(PLEASED)

No! Come up!

DOWN BELOW

24

SAME TIME--NIGHT

KITTY

Look at me! I'm receiving for Papa and

Maman who are late to dress. It's my first

reception.

LEVIN

Princess Ekaterina! Delighted, delighted!

KITTY

( FORMAL)

I'm so pleased you were able to be with us,

Konstantin Dmitrich!

LEVIN

(DROPPING IT)

Kitty . . . you look . . . you look--

KITTY

Stiva told us you were back. How long are

you staying?

LEVIN

I don't know. It depends on you.

KITTY

On me?

25

LEVIN

What I mean to say--I came with only one

purpose--I want to--will you be my wife?

LEVIN (CONT'D)

I'm sorry--sorry--wrong moment--but

will you?

KITTY

I can't. I'm sorry.

LEVIN

Yes. It was impossible.

BURISOV

Burisov. Are you the brother of Nikolai

Levin?

26

LEVIN

Yes.

BURISOV

He's in Moscow, he's staying at the Unicorn

in Khitrovka.

LEVIN

How do you know?

BURISOV

(SMILES)

It's the sort of thing I know.

LEVIN

Count Vronsky?

VRONSKY

Yes.

VRONSKY (CONT'D)

(BANTERING)

Princess Kitty . . . It's been so long, and yet

it seems like yesterday.

27

KITTY

It was yesterday!

LEVIN

It's Kostya.

28

NIKOLAI

God, look at him! You look like a capitalist!

(THEN SUSPICIOUSLY)

What do you want?

LEVIN

Nothing. I came to see you.

NIGHT

LEVIN

Good evening, miss . . . madame . . .

NIKOLAI

Don't talk to her like that. It frightens her.

You sound like a magistrate.

(shouts at her)

More vodka for my brother, quick about it.

LEVIN

I don't want anything.

NIKOLAI

I'm all right.

29

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

Who told you where to find me?

LEVIN

A colonel in the Third Department. They're

watching you.

NIKOLAI

Good. They must think I'm dangerous.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

What have you got to smile about?

LEVIN

Nothing.

NIKOLAI

That's right. The day is coming. I gave up

my birthright for it. You're on the wrong

side of history. Not because privilege is

immoral but because it's irrational.

MASHA

He is sick.

NIKOLAI

Let go or I'll beat your lights out.

30

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

I took Mary Nikolova from a brothel but I

consider her my wife. If her presence offends

you you're free to leave. Are you married?

LEVIN

No.

NIKOLAI

Why not? Are you waiting to fall in love?

LEVIN

No.

NIKOLAI

Good. Romantic love will be the last illu-

sion of the old order. You should marry one

of your peasants.

LEVIN

Yes. I damn well should!

NIKOLAI

(toasts, casually)

The brotherhood of man.

LEVIN

Nikolai, you have to see a doctor. Then

come and stay with me at Pokrovskoe till

you get your health back.

31

NIKOLAI

(SCORNFULLY)

With my wife?

LEVIN

If you . . . or go abroad to a spa. I'll send you

more if that's what you . . .

LEVIN (CONT'D)

(CRIES OUT)

What about the brotherhood of brothers?

STATIONMASTER

The private coach will stop opposite the

carpet.

32

VRONSKY

Hello, what's this?

GUARDS OFFICER

Austrian royalty on their honeymoon. I've

got them for four days.

VRONSKY

Bad luck. What do they like? Art?

GUARDS OFFICER

Food.

VRONSKY

Here's the train.

TIME--DAY

STATIONMASTER

I'll see to it.

33

MAJOR DOMO

Second carriage, Your Excellency. I'll see to

the Countess's luggage and bring it on to the

house.

34

ANNA

I'll come back.

ANNA

(ACCUSINGLY)

You don't look ashamed.

OBLONSKY

(CONTRITE)

I am, I really am.

35

VRONSKY

Yes, of course. Oblonsky's sister . . .

Karenina.

COUNTESS

Charmante, don't you think?

(to her Maid)

Wait for me in the carriage. I'll take Tosca.

VRONSKY

. . . You stayed longer in St. Petersburg.

COUNTESS VRONSKY

Long enough for you to start a little love

affair, I hear.

VRONSKY

I can't think what you're referring to,

Maman.

36

ANNA

There, Countess, you have found your son

and I have found my brother.

COUNTESS VRONSKY

Madame Karenin has a son, too. It's the first

time they have been apart, so she frets about

him.

VRONSKY

Excuse me for not recognizing you before.

COUNTESS VRONSKY

We passed the time telling each other about

our sons.

ANNA

Yes, I've been hearing all about you.

VRONSKY

That must have been very boring for you.

ANNA

Au revoir, Countess.

COUNTESS VRONSKY

Au revoir, my dear. Let me kiss your pretty

face.

37

VRONSKY

Keep your people inside until this has been

cleared up.

OBLONSKY

. . . the sole support of a large family, they

say.

38

ANNA

Can't anything be done for them?

VRONSKY

Wait for me, Maman.

COUNTESS VRONSKY

(TO ANNA)

I've you to thank for that.

OBLONSKY

What a good fellow . . .

ANNA

Have you known Count Vronsky long?

OBLONSKY

Did you like him? He's in love with Kitty.

ANNA

Oh . . .

(PAUSE)

But we should be discussing you and Dolly.

39

ANNA (CONT'D)

What have you got to say for yourself?

OBLONSKY

I've said it all--on my knees--in tears . . .

Now I need you to say it. I'm going to the

office, so you'll have Dolly to yourself.

ANNA

(SEVERELY)

Don't be home late.

MOSCOW--DAY

DOLLY

Kitty's coming by to see you. She's all

grown-up, and a bit frightened of you--the

belle of St. Petersburg society!

ANNA

Is that who I am?

Dolly . . . Stiva has told me.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Dolly, I'm sorry from the bottom of my

heart.

40

DOLLY

ANNA

(SOOTHING)

DOLLY

ANNA

DOLLY

ANNA

DOLLY

ANNA

DOLLY

41

ANNA

My poor lamb. So you'd rather accept your

fate . . .

DOLLY

My fate?

(OUTRAGED)

But I haven't done anything! It's him

WHO'S--

ANNA

Do you love him, Dolly?

ANNA (CONT'D)

You love him, and he loves you, but you

can't forgive, so your lives must continue

like this for ever, with both of you wretched.

42

ANNA

Grisha, don't pull so hard, you're getting it

all in a tangle--and look for another G for

GRIGORI--

(She takes off her ring for Tanya)

--here, darling, you can wear it till you go

TO BED--

ANNA (CONT'D)

Well, that's the end of that.

KITTY

Will you stay for the Bobrishchev's ball,

Anna?

ANNA

Oh . . . I always feel dull at a ball.

KITTY

How can you ever be dull?

KITTY (CONT'D)

Stiva! Tell Anna she must come to the ball.

OBLONSKY

Of course she must.

43

ANNA

. . . and God go with you.

OBLONSKY

(LEAVING)

You can introduce me to your new governess.

TANYA

She's old! She's a hundred!

ANNA

I know why you want me to come. You want

everyone to be there because you're sure it's

going to be your night.

KITTY

How did you know?

ANNA

I know everything.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Oh, to be your age again . . . surrounded by

that blue mist, like mist on the mountains

44

that clears slowly to reveal the terrifying,

beautiful valley you must enter to become

grown-up . . . I was eighteen too, when I

got married . . .

TIME--NIGHT

SERVANT

. . . no, Your Excellency . . . He's just gone

up. . . . The Princess retired early . . . Is

there a message?

VRONSKY

No.

45

LEVIN

Will you go to confession?

LEVIN (CONT'D)

God will forgive you.

SERAFINA

And you also, master. He is watching.

LEVIN

God forgive us then, for committing the act

of love.

46

SERAFINA

He is merciful.

LEVIN

"Not according to my deserts, O Lord,

but according to thy mercy"--that's a fine

prayer. But I'm full of doubt. Sometimes I

even doubt that God exists.

SERAFINA

How can there be anything if God didn't

make it?

LEVIN

I don't know. One day science will tell us.

SERAFINA

That's sinful talk if the priest heard you.

LEVIN

Well, I won't go to confession.

SERAFINA

(SHRUGS)

Your father built the church. You're con-

fessed a while yet.

SERAFINA (CONT'D)

Will you bring me something from

Moscow?

LEVIN

What would you like?

47

SERAFINA

Soap, the kind wrapped in paper to look

pretty, and smelling like for a proper lady.

YOUTH

Kitty! May I have a waltz?

KITTY

You may, Boris. I'll save you the third just

because it's your first ball.

YOUTH

(THRILLED)

You're my first conquest.

48

KORSUNSKY

It's a relaxation to dance with you, Princess.

KORSUNSKY (CONT'D)

But back to work! Where do you want to

be taken?

KITTY

There.

KORSUNSKY

(BOWING)

So that your ankles may be seen.

KITTY

How are you, Stiva?

OBLONSKY

Thanks to Anna, I am a happy man. Would

you like to dance?

KITTY

No, ask Anna.

49

ANNA

(DEMURS)

No . . . I don't . . .

ANNA (CONT'D)

Come on then.

PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY

. . . this vile, idiotic matchmaking of

yours . . .

PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY

For goodness' sake, what have I done?

PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY

Levin is a thousand times better than this

Petersburg fop. If he had royal blood my

daughter wouldn't need him!

KITTY

Is anything the matter?

50

VRONSKY

No. You look . . . as lovely as ever, Princess

Kitty.

KITTY

(SHARPLY)

Don't ask me, Maman!

COUNTESS NORDSTON

He'll dance the mazurka with Kitty, you'll

see. I call the mazurka the now-or-never.

AUSTRIAN PRINCESS

. . . we were shut up in the train for an hour!

51

VRONSKY

Dance with me.

ANNA

(CALMLY)

I am not used to being spoken to like that

by a man I met once at a railway station.

VRONSKY

I dare say, but if I'm not to dance with you,

I'm getting out of this operetta and going

home.

ANNA

Then, for Kitty's sake.

52

COUNTESS NORDSTON

You're not dancing the mazurka? I won't

have it.

countess nordston (cont'd)

I'm engaged by General Glub--I give him

to you.

KORSUNSKY

. . . the lady chooses a lady and a

gentleman . . . !

KORSUNSKY (CONT'D)

(ADDRESSING ANNA)

. . . and the lady chooses a lady and a

gentleman . . . !

53

MONTAGE

54

GUARD

Bologoye! Fifteen minutes.

VRONSKY

Can I be of service to you?

ANNA

I didn't know you were . . . Why are you

leaving?

55

VRONSKY

You know why. I have to be where you are.

I can't not.

ANNA

This is wrong. If you're a good man, forget

everything that happened, as I will.

VRONSKY

I'll never forget a single thing about you,

not a word, not a gesture--

ANNA

That's enough!

VRONSKY

Take the luggage home.

ANNA

(ANXIOUS)

Is Serozha all right?

56

KARENIN

Oh, is that all I get? Yes, he's quite well.

VRONSKY

Did you have a good night?

ANNA

Yes, quite comfortable. Count Vronsky.

KARENIN

I have to get back to the Committee . . .

KARENIN (CONT'D)

Well--were you a success?

ANNA

I? Oh--Dolly and Stiva . . . yes, I think

so . . .

57

DAY

TIME--DAY

VRONSKY

I'll announce myself.

PETRITSKY

Vronsky! The master himself. Baroness,

coffee from the new coffeepot for Count

Vronsky.

PETRITSKY (CONT'D)

I hope you are pleased by this ornament to

your quarters.

BARONESS

I'll be off home if I'm in the way.

You've stopped.

SEROZHA (CONT'D)

(SLEEPILY)

Thank you for my present.

ANNA

Sssh . . .

60

NIGHT

KARENIN

Time for bed!

ANNA

I'm writing to Dolly . . . and to Kitty.

KARENIN

You are . . . good.

61

KARENIN

What are they saying in Moscow about the

new Statute?

ANNA

What new Statute?

KARENIN

The new Statute I carried in Council.

ANNA

No one mentioned it.

KARENIN

Ah. Really?

KARENIN (CONT'D)

Here it made quite a sensation.

62

MOSCOW--DAY

FAMILY DOCTOR

Forgive me, Princess, but I must . . .

PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY

Am I the only one who knows what's wrong

with her?

PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY

Oh, thank God, doctor--my friends say

you're the only one who can save her!

CELEBRITY DOCTOR

Possibly, Princess, possibly! At your service,

Your Excellencies. Where is the patient?

63

CELEBRITY DOCTOR

Come, come, Princess, we are not backward

people--I handle naked bodies every day.

Deep breath now . . .

PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY

By God. I'll challenge the scoundrel!

FAMILY DOCTOR

It's the modern way . . .

PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY

(to the Prince)

You're not a doctor!

FAMILY DOCTOR

Her symptoms . . . loss of appetite, fast

PULSE--

PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY

Well, whose pulse wouldn't be fast if some

brute of a--

64

CELEBRITY DOCTOR

Nervous palpitations. We must treat the

nerves. A tubercular cavity is suspected, too

soon to tell. Soden water every two hours. I

must see her again tomorrow.

(HE BOWS)

Prince! Princess!

PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY

Don't you fret, my little Kate! You'll wake

up one fine morning and say to yourself--"I

feel well and happy and I'll go out for a

walk with Papa!"

65

BETSY

I want to give a small dinner before the opera.

Is there anyone you would like me to ask?

ANNA

Yes . . . Yes, the Metropolitan Bishop of St.

Petersburg.

HOUSE--NIGHT

66

KARENIN

Countess Lydia tells me you haven't been to

one of her evenings since you returned.

ANNA

The last one was to meet a missionary, the

one before was for a lecture on the union of

the Greek and Roman churches.

(CLIMBS DOWN)

I'm sorry--I know you're fond of her. Come

on, or we'll be late.

DEMIN

Here's the thing, Vronsky. A posting has

come up and there's a promotion in it for

you.

VRONSKY

Thank you, sir.

DEMIN

The garrison in Tashkent.

67

VRONSKY

Tashkent? But . . . I would like to stay in

Peter, sir, if you don't mind.

DEMIN

I don't mind. But your mother . . .

BETSY

You didn't come to my dinner.

VRONSKY

I had to see my Commanding Officer.

68

BETSY

"She" didn't come either.

LYDIA

. . . work never ceases for great men.

Your husband is a saint and we must all

cherish him for Russia's sake.

LYDIA (CONT'D)

I hope you can come on afterwards--Father

Kristof's report on the Chinese mission will

be with lantern slides.

ANNA

I'm expected at the Tverskoys.

LYDIA

No doubt, but I'm sure Princess Betsy can

wait for you, my dear.

ANNA

Yes. In fact, I think I won't go to Betsy's.

69

BETSY

You're caught.

VRONSKY

I'm afraid I am becoming ridiculous.

HOUSE--DAY

LISA MERKALOVA

Now, there's a phenomenon, look-- Anna's

shadow has arrived before Anna!

ANNA'S FRIEND

I'm Anna's friend . . . but this making-up-

one's-mind-to-it in public is not polite to a

distinguished man like Karenin.

PRINCESS MYAGKAYA

In my opinion Karenin is a fool, and Anna

is the best of us.

70

LISA MERKALOVA

And we all love you for your contrary opin-

ions, Princess.

BETSY

Alexei . . . You look desperate. That's not

attractive.

VRONSKY

I'm losing hope.

BETSY

Hope of what? Persuading a virtuous

woman to break her marriage vows?

VRONSKY

And how is Tuskevich?

BETSY

That's not attractive either. Besides, I was

never virtuous.

VRONSKY

No--you're right. She won't come. I'm

going home.

71

VRONSKY

Turn round!

HOUSE--NIGHT

VOICES

Wasn't Nilsson glorious? One sees that she

has studied Kaulbach, of course . . .

There's something Louis Quinze about

Tuskevich . . . as if he came with the

furniture . . .

BETSY

He's gone. But you're just in time for the

surprise.

72

REVERSE

vronsky (O.C.)

May I have the honour of bringing you an

ice?

VRONSKY (CONT'D)

Ices are being served.

ANNA

I would prefer to try a cigarette.

73

VRONSKY

(IN FRENCH)

Courage!

ANNA

Thank you.

ANNA (CONT'D)

I'll try another one sometime.

VRONSKY

When?

VRONSKY (CONT'D)

Where?

ANNA

Just as I was thinking your manners have

improved since Moscow. You behaved badly,

very badly.

VRONSKY

And who was responsible for that?

ANNA

Give me a cup of tea.

74

BETSY

How nice--Alexei Aleksandrevich has

arrived.

LISA MERKALOVA

I'm not sure my nerves can stand another

Alexei at this moment.

PRINCESS MYAGKAYA

So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner. The

sauce was said to have cost a thousand rou-

bles, and it was ghastly. We had to ask them

back. I gave them a sauce that cost eighty-

five kopeks and it was a triumph.

VRONSKY

Were you glad to see me or not?

75

ANNA

This must stop. You make me feel as if I

were guilty of something.

VRONSKY

What do you want me to do?

ANNA

I want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty

to forgive you.

VRONSKY

No, that's not what you want. Moscow? I

can do better than that. Tonight I refused a

posting to Tashkent. I can change my mind,

and you'll never see me again.

ANNA

If you have any thought for me, you will

give me back my peace.

VRONSKY

I have no peace to give. There can be no

peace for us--only misery or the greatest

happiness. You are my whole life now.

BETSY

Your husband is impossible!-- his opinions

are all wrong but he talks so brilliantly he

wins every argument.

76

ANNA

What?

KARENIN

I called to take you home.

ANNA

No, I'm staying. Send the carriage back

for me.

KARENIN

Of course.

LATER

77

VRONSKY

Do you want me to go to Tashkent?

TIME--NIGHT

TIME--NIGHT

VRONSKY

So I'll go to Tashkent.

ANNA

No. I don't want you to go.

TIME--NIGHT

78

HOUSE--NIGHT

ANNA

Waiting up? How unlike you!

KARENIN

Yes, I stayed up to talk to you.

ANNA

What about? It's late. Where's Annushka?

KARENIN

I sent her off.

ANNA

Well, if you want to talk, but we should go

to bed.

79

KARENIN

ANNA

KARENIN

KARENIN

ANNA

I have nothing to say to you, and I'm tired.

KARENIN

And you have a son.

TIME--NIGHT

KARENIN

Forgive me.

(TURNING ASIDE)

If I am wrong, I ask your pardon.

ANNA

(LIGHTLY)

I don't know what you're talking about, and

it's really too late for this. Excuse me, please.

ANNA

(ALMOST INAUDIBLE)

Too late.

81

CLOSE--

82

ANNA

Oh God forgive me. It's the end of

everything--I've got nothing left now, only

you. Remember that.

VRONSKY

Anna . . . Anna . . . how can I not remem-

ber? You're my happiness.

83

ANNA

Happiness! You murdered my happiness.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Murderer. Murderer. Go on. Go on. Go on.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Yes. Go on. Go on. Go on.

LEVIN

I thought that had been done.

VASILI

I gave the order. What can you do with

these people?

84

LATER

OBLONSKY

Ah--potage aux choux a la Russe!

OBLONSKY (CONT'D)

Agafia!--if you opened up in Moscow,

l'Angleterre would go out of business.

Do you want news of Moscow?

LEVIN

Of Babylon? No.

OBLONSKY

You're right, what do you care? You love the

country--you've got it. You love agricultur-

ing, and, Lord knows, you've got it. You love

shooting--you've got it. You've got every-

thing you want!

LEVIN

All right, go on, then. Have you stopped

stealing bread rolls?

85

OBLONSKY

Ballet girl, oriental type. How can I help it?

LEVIN

So, nothing new to tell me. How is--how

are the Shcherbatskys?

OBLONSKY

You mean Kitty.

LEVIN

I . . . Is she engaged now?

OBLONSKY

No. Vronsky went back to St. Petersburg.

OBLONSKY (CONT'D)

Kitty will be at Ergoshovo visiting Dolly in

the summer. You could . . .

LEVIN

Oh yes, as if I had time in the summer! And

I've got extra land this year at Kashin for

the haymaking.

OBLONSKY

Kashin? That's on the Ergoshovo road, isn't

it? Won't you call when Kitty is there?

LEVIN

(HEATEDLY)

Especially not then. I humiliated myself once.

86

OBLONSKY

Damn you, Kostya, you love Kitty and you

can't forgive her because, first, you funked

it, then you bungled it, then you ran away

from an eighteen-year-old girl who was

made a fool of by a uniform. It's Kitty I'm

sorry for--not you!

LEVIN

Her heart told her no. Did you come to

shoot snipe or criticize me?

LEVIN

For you, getting married is . . . a social engage-

ment. Not for me. For me, it's the condition of

personal happiness and living the right way.

I'll never again be carried away by passion. I

renounce it. I'll have to find another way . . .

OBLONSKY

Look out--here they come!

OBLONSKY (CONT'D)

Bad luck!

87

SPRING

DOLLY

There. Oh, I'm sore with his feeding! Would

you like to hold him?

DOLLY (CONT'D)

Well, don't hold him like a parcel . . . It's

Aunt Kitty, darling. . . . Little face . . .

little fingers . . . look at you . . . Doesn't

he make you ashamed of dwelling on your

troubles . . . ?

KITTY

I have no troubles.

DOLLY

That man wasn't worth the tears, believe me.

KITTY

(IRRITATED)

I don't care about him. I don't even think

about him. Or her. Except to hate her.

DOLLY

Then we'll never speak of it again.

88

DOLLY (CONT'D)

There are better men waiting for you. Stiva

says . . . Kitty, my lamb, did Konstantin

Levin . . . ?

KITTY

( FLARES)

What has Levin got to do with it? Anyway,

I'll never get married. The whole business

of . . . it's become disgusting to me . . . and

look what it's done for you! Why do they

call it love?

DOLLY

Because it's love.

SPRING

ANNA

I want you to. I don't care about it.

VRONSKY

You should care. You're not supposed to.

89

ANNA

Pooh! Who says?

VRONSKY

Everybody. Doctors.

ANNA

You're squeamish. You a soldier! Would you

faint?

VRONSKY

Anyway, someone might be watching.

ANNA

But I'm damned anyway.

VRONSKY

I'm not. I'm blessed.

ANNA

You love me.

VRONSKY

Yes.

ANNA

Only me.

90

VRONSKY

No.

ANNA

Apart from Frou-Frou.

VRONSKY

Yes.

ANNA

But me more than your horse?

VRONSKY

Yes.

ANNA

Are you happy?

VRONSKY

Yes.

ANNA

And you love me?

VRONSKY

Yes.

ANNA

How much?

VRONSKY

This much.

91

ANNA

This much?

VRONSKY

Yes.

ANNA

This much?

VRONSKY

Yes.

ANNA

This much?

VRONSKY

Yes.

ANNA

This much? And this much? And this

much?

VRONSKY

Yes.

ANNA

( FIERCELY)

And . . . this . . . much . . . ?

92

ANNA (CONT'D)

So this is love. This.

SUMMER

KARENIN

Countess . . . I thought you would be at

Peterhof now.

LYDIA

I've come from there. I'm distressed that you

haven't taken your usual house this year.

KARENIN

Anna wanted a change. She is spending the

summer at Tsarskoe.

LYDIA

Near Princess Betsy. And . . .

LYDIA (CONT'D)

The Guards are in summer camp at

Tsarskoe.

93

LYDIA (CONT'D)

Alexei Alexandrovich, forgive me but you

are too tolerant! Your wife . . .

KARENIN

Oh, is this about my wife?

KARENIN (CONT'D)

My wife is beyond reproach. She is, after

all, my wife.

ALEXANDER

Alyosha . . . a message from Maman. Her

friend Princess Sorokina has a house here,

and a virgin daughter, that's not part of the

94

message, but they'll all be at the races and

you're expected to supper afterwards.

DEMIN

Gentlemen--I give you--the regiment!

ALEXANDER

I heard you turned down a promotion.

VRONSKY

That was Maman interfering.

ALEXANDER

Yes. And now she's come up with a princess

for you.

(SERIOUSLY)

Alexei--we're brothers, so don't take

offence. Getting married puts the pack on

your back--it leaves your hands free for

climbing the ladder. Getting serious about

a married woman is like carrying your pack

in your arms.

95

VRONSKY

So they talk about me. I'm leaving, Sasha.

ALEXANDER

An assignation?

VRONSKY

Come on, I'll introduce you.

ALEXANDER

Beautiful. A man would come to no harm.

Do you think you'll win tomorrow?

VRONSKY

Makhotin's Gladiator is favourite, sixteen

hands--Frou-Frou looks dainty beside

him, but she's got heart. Haven't you, my

darling?

96

VRONSKY

Anna.

ANNA

Alexei, what is it?

VRONSKY

I couldn't bear not to see you before the race.

VRONSKY (CONT'D)

What were you thinking about?

VRONSKY (CONT'D)

Tell me.

ANNA

I'm pregnant.

VRONSKY

Ah . . . My love.

97

VRONSKY (CONT'D)

Well, love was never a game to us. Here's an

end to living in corners, existing day to day

on lies. Yes, now we can be together.

ANNA

How can we, Alexei?

VRONSKY

Tell Karenin everything.

ANNA

Do you think my husband will make you a

present of me?

VRONSKY

Leave him.

ANNA

Leave him and be your mistress?

VRONSKY

Yes. Run away.

ANNA

I would never see my son again. The laws

are made by husbands and fathers.

VRONSKY

What, then? I'll never forgive myself for

your unhappiness.

98

ANNA

Unhappiness? I'm like a starving beggar

who has been given food.

ANNA (CONT'D)

I unhappy? No, this is my happiness!

TSARSKOE--DAY

KARENIN

How are you, young man? Your tutor

doesn't seem to be in evidence. We'll have a

look at your lesson books.

ANNA

Alexei!--you got away at last. Can you stay?

KARENIN

Why . . . ?

99

ANNA

Go and find Vasily Lukich.

ANNA (CONT'D)

I have to change. Princess Betsy is sending

her trap for me. Would you like to come?--

she's taking me to watch the race.

KARENIN

Races, surely. No, I'll come on later, and

then I must get back to town.

Exquisite creature . . . you really ought to be

the spoil of victory today . . .

I'm here.

KARENIN (CONT'D)

Would you like to leave?

ANNA

ANNA

Stiva! What are they saying?

OBLONSKY

Vronsky's unhurt--but the horse . . .

VRONSKY

OFFICER

Her back's broken!

KARENIN

KARENIN

I'm asking you . . . if you wish to go . . .

106

ANNA

No, leave me alone.

BETSY

I'll bring her home, Alexei.

KARENIN

(SMILING POLITELY)

Excuse me, Princess, but Anna is not well

and I want her to come with me.

KARENIN

You know . . . they say the Emperor dis-

approves of the races . . . the danger of

injury . . . but I . . .

ANNA

What?

KARENIN

I'm saying there is a value in manly sport,

for the military--

107

ANNA

I don't understand.

KARENIN

In my opinion, it's not the sport itself that's

wrong, it's the spectacle, it's making a cruel

spectacle out of--

ANNA

What are you talking about?

KARENIN

I have to tell you--

ANNA

Yes.

KARENIN

I have to tell you, you behaved improperly

today.

ANNA

And how was that?

KARENIN

By making plain your feelings when one of

the riders fell. Your conduct was improper.

It must not occur again. I have said it before.

108

KARENIN (CONT'D)

You are going to say my concern is unneces-

sary and ridiculous. You are my wife. I am

wrong to think that . . . yes--perhaps I was

mistaken.

ANNA

No, you were not mistaken. I love him. I

am his mistress. I can't bear you, I'm afraid

of you, I hate you. Do what you like to me.

KARENIN

Wait, please. Move away.

KARENIN (CONT'D)

I will not have a scandal. Therefore . . . You

will not see . . . this man again. You will

behave in such a way that nothing is known

against you, by society or by the servants.

In return, you will keep the privileges of a

109

wife--and the duties. Tomorrow you will

return home. That is all.

ANNA

Are you hurt?

VRONSKY

What's happened?

ANNA

I told him I'm your mistress.

ANNA (CONT'D)

He thinks I can give you up and go on

living.

110

VRONSKY

No, you cannot.

MAJOR DOMO

Their Excellencies Minister Karenin and

Madame Karenin!

BETSY

Alexei Aleksandrevich . . . congratulations.

You're the only man my husband would do

this for.

ANNA

(To Prince Tverskoy)

Tell me your latest find for your library.

PRINCE TVERSKOY

Not in front of the Princess.

111

BETSY

I can tell you're happy. You've put on a little

weight.

ANNA

Both true.

NIGHT

TIME--NIGHT

KARENIN

Time for bed!

NIGHT

112

KARENIN

. . . not that I care for decorations but . . .

ANNA

Alexei . . . I can't . . . I'm sorry . . . But I'm

his wife now.

(she turns to him)

I am having his child.

NIGHT

KARENIN

Tell me what I did to deserve this.

113

YOUNG PEASANT

Konstantin Dmitrich, you'll know your

rows when the field's all done!

LEVIN

How many mowers is it, Theodore?

THEODORE

Forty-two, master. In your father's time it

was work for two days for thirty men . . .

(SLYLY)

. . . though he never picked up a scythe

himself.

LEVIN

THEODORE

LEVIN

It's true I was looking at him.

THEODORE

At his wife too, I dare say.

LEVIN

They look happier than I've ever been. Is it

living simply that I'm looking for?

VRONSKY

He's some kind of prince at home. Exhaust-

ing. Where is Tuskevitch this evening?

BETSY

Why ask me?

117

VRONSKY

Captain Makhotin . . .

VRONSKY (CONT'D)

I must leave you. I'm on duty tonight.

MAKHOTIN

Lucky woman. Give her my respects, and to

Karenin if you see him.

BETSY

Don't. Would you compromise me? And

Lisa?

STREMOV

(SMIRKS)

I only say that a man who can't govern his

wife has perhaps gone as far as he can go in

government.

DAY

118

TIME--NIGHT

KAPITONICH

Good evening, Your Excellency.

VRONSKY

I am expected.

TIME--NIGHT

119

ANNA

No!--no. I will not live like this!

ANNA (CONT'D)

Waiting hour after hour while you're drink-

ing champagne with naked actresses--

don't think I don't know!--Lisa Merkalova

still calls on me.

VRONSKY

It's punishment enough that I'm on escort

duty, without . . .

ANNA

Yes--I'm sorry--it's my demon, I can't help it.

VRONSKY

You wrote that you were ill.

ANNA

Did I? Well, I am!

(GAILY)

But don't worry! It won't be for long, I'll

soon be out of your way--soon!

VRONSKY

Stop.

ANNA

No, it's true. I was told it in a dream.

120

VRONSKY

There, it was only a bad dream.

ANNA

Yes, and I'm only going to die having your

baby.

VRONSKY

That's all nonsense!

ANNA

Tell me it is, tell me it is. You love me. Only me.

VRONSKY

Your note said your husband would be out.

ANNA

He was late. Serves him right. And you.

Why do you call him my husband? He isn't

my husband--he's a clock, a wooden doll--

VRONSKY

But it was awkward . . . a matter of your

honour. You made an agreement.

ANNA

Do you think of my honour when you're

sharing whores with your Hindoo!

VRONSKY

Your demon again!

121

ANNA

I'll be glad to die, before you start to hate me!

VRONSKY

Anna . . .

ANNA

Put your hand there. There! Did you feel

him move!

STREMOV

I must respectfully ask Minister Karenin

whether his proposals for the regulation of

these colourful Gypsy tribes, of these schol-

arly God-fearing Jews, and of--but I'm

afraid I have lost the Minister's attention . . .

122

KARENIN

Who is here?

KAPITONICH

Only Madame, Your Excellency.

TIME--NIGHT

ANNA

I wanted to see him because . . .

KARENIN

I do not wish to be told why a woman wants

to see her lover.

ANNA

What are you . . . ?

KARENIN

I want his letters.

123

KARENIN (CONT'D)

I am going to Moscow tomorrow, and

then to the provinces with a commission

to investigate conditions among the Jews

and Gypsies--whose conditions I infinitely

prefer to my own. I will not return to this

house until divorce has put you into the

street. Meanwhile my son will be sent to

live with my eldest sister.

ANNA

(WAILS)

Alexei . . . please . . . leave me Serozha . . . !

KARENIN

Do you think I would let you have my son?

You are depraved, a woman without honour. I

thank God the curse of love is lifted from me.

WINTER AGAIN

124

TIME--DAY

OBLONSKY

Levin! What . . . ?

LEVIN

I need your advice . . .

COUNTESS NORDSTON

Well, is he coming?

LEVIN

Am I late? Who is here?

OBLONSKY

Of course you're late! Come and meet . . .

Countess Nordston.

125

COUNTESS NORDSTON

(drily, amused)

We nearly met at the Shcherbatsky's last winter.

PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY

Come into the fold . . .

DOLLY

Kitty is here.

KITTY

Konsantin . . . what a long time since we

saw each other.

LEVIN

Since you saw me, but I saw you not so long

ago.

KITTY

When?

LEVIN

You were driving to Ergoshovo . . . I was at

Kashin for the haymaking.

KITTY

Oh, but why didn't you . . . ?

126

LEVIN

I'm so glad to see you. You're just the same.

KITTY

I hope not--I was young and silly in those

days.

LEVIN

Months and months ago!

KITTY

And you haven't changed.

LEVIN

No. I haven't.

OBLONSKY

Permit me to announce--soup Marie Lou-

ise, carp with asparagus, and roast beef! I

went to the market in person!

OBLONSKY (CONT'D)

(TO MATVEY)

An extra place.

TIME--NIGHT

127

OBLONSKY

Karenin!--I'm glad you came.

KARENIN

I've been on tour in the regions, a govern-

ment commission . . . I'm sorry--I have

come to tell you our connection must be

severed. I'm going to divorce your sister.

OBLONSKY

Divorce? Dear me, what are you talking

about? Don't be in a hurry. Stay to dinner

and later talk it over with Dolly--

KARENIN

Prince Oblonsky, everything is over between

our families.

OBLONSKY

(REPROACHFULLY)

Alexei . . . divorce is one thing but dinner

is quite another.

PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY

You Petersburgers think yourselves so de

bon ton compared with dull, old-fashioned

128

Moscow, but we know how to do things--

only the other day, I hear, Vasya Pryachnikov

fought a duel with Kvitsky and killed him.

OBLONSKY

Well, what's this government commission,

Karenin . . . ?

KARENIN

What was the challenge about?

PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY

Pryachnikov's wife, naturally.

PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY

It was a matter of honour, defending a

woman's honour . . .

KARENIN

It sounds like barbarism to me . . . And

what if the lover had killed the husband?--

would that have preserved the wife's honour

too?

COUNTESS NORDSTON

Still, not many of us can say that our lover

died for love!

129

KARENIN

Love? Thou shall not covet thy neighbour's wife.

COUNTESS NORDSTON

Would you die for love, Konstantin Dmitrich?

LEVIN

I would. But not for my neighbour's wife.

LEVIN (CONT'D)

An impure love is not love, to me. To admire

another man's wife is a pleasant thing, but

sensual desire indulged for its own sake is

greed, a kind of gluttony, and a misuse of

something sacred which is given to us so

that we may choose the one person with

whom to fulfill our humanness. Otherwise

we might as well be cattle.

COUNTESS NORDSTON

Ah, an idealist!

130

DOLLY

. . . but she will be nobody's wife, she'll be

ruined.

KARENIN

I tried to save her. She chose ruin.

DOLLY

Alexei Aleksandrevich--look at me. You

will have no peace of mind until you forgive

her. It was Anna who taught me that.

KARENIN

I do not wish to forgive. I am not a cruel

man. I have never hated anyone. But I hate

her with all my soul for all the wrong she

has done me.

OBLONSKY

It's your turn to play us something,

Countess.

LEVIN

Since we last met, there is something I have

often wanted to ask you.

KITTY

What is that?

131

LEVIN

This.

KITTY

Do Not . . .

KITTY (CONT'D)

Did. Did Not.

KITTY (CONT'D)

The last word is Never.

LEVIN

I know what it says.

132

LEVIN (CONT'D)

Then. But now?

LEVIN (CONT'D)

Can You.

LEVIN (CONT'D)

Can you Forgive. And Forget.

LEVIN (CONT'D)

I never stopped . . .

I BEG YOU TO COME. I NEED YOUR FORGIVENESS.

I AM DYING.

KARENIN

Die, then.

133

KARENIN

How is your mistress?

KAPITONICH

Safely delivered of a daughter, Your

Excellency.

KARENIN

So . . . she is well?

KAPITONICH

The mistress is very poorly. The doctor . . .

TIME--DAY

134

TIME--DAY

VRONSKY

She's dying. Please let me stay.

DOCTOR

Thank God! She talks only of you.

ANNA

Why doesn't he come? He is kind. He will

forgive me.

MIDWIFE

He's here--look--look--can't you see him?

ANNA

I want Alexei! Why doesn't he come? Give

me some water. No, I mustn't, it's not good

for my little girl. Or let her have a nurse.

Yes--don't bring her here, because Alexei

is coming and it will hurt him to see her.

135

ANNUSHKA

He's come, my dear--look there . . .

DOCTOR

(TO ANNUSHKA)

More ice.

ANNA

Oh, what nonsense. I must be asleep, that's

what it is. You think he won't forgive me

but you don't know him. No one knows

him except me. I'm not afraid of him now.

ANNA (CONT'D)

I'm afraid of death, though.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Oh, my dear. Don't look at me like that.

I am not the one you think. I'm afraid of

her. She fell in love with another man. I'm

the real one. But I'm dying now, then she'll

be dead, too. Poor man! Let him come in.

Alexis! Alexis!

136

ANNA

Take your hands away from your face. Look

at my husband. He's a saint! Take his hand.

Alexei--take his hands away.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Forgive him, too. Thank God, thank

God . . .

DAWN

ANNA (CONT'D)

So you came.

ANNA (CONT'D)

If I had died as I wanted, you would be free

of your troubles at last.

137

KARENIN

I am free of them.

VRONSKY

Whatever you think of me, please believe

me, I love her--I could not have done other-

wise than what I . . . what I did.

KARENIN

But you must leave now. I promise to send

for you if she asks for you. I don't know what

happened. I forgive you. I forgive Anna. My

soul is filled with joy. I will remain with her

and look after her for ever.

KARENIN (CONT'D)

Come now, come now . . .

138

COUNTESS VRONSKY

Look at you. You look like what you are. A

laughingstock. I fancy you are to be asked

to leave the regiment.

VRONSKY

I would like you to go, Maman.

COUNTESS VRONSKY

I will go when I'm ready to go. A little

affair with a married woman puts a finish-

ing touch to a young man's education--but

this morbid, selfish obsession . . . ! You have

publicly humiliated a man who has devoted

his life to Russia, and it will not be forgot-

ten. You'd better come back to Moscow

with me. You're finished here.

VRONSKY

In Petersburg?

(he taps his breastbone)

I'm finished here.

139

DAY

LEVIN

. . . no, I'll go to her and tell her it's not

too late to stop this business! Better now

than when we're married and she realises

she doesn't love me!

OBLONSKY

But she does love you!

LEVIN

How can she? I mean, look at me! Suppose

she's only marrying me to get married?

Suppose she's still in love with Vronsky?

She's making a terrible mistake! I'll go

to her and tell her she's free, that's what I

must do . . .

MATVEY

Your coat, sir.

140

DAY

PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY

Konstantin!--what-- ?

LEVIN

I have to talk to Kitty.

PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY

You're not allowed to see her!

KITTY

No. I don't understand at all! What's the

matter with you?

LEVIN

You can't love me. Think it over! Let people

say what they like!

KITTY

( FRIGHTENED)

Are you mad? Have you changed your

mind?

LEVIN

Yes. If you don't love me.

KITTY

But I do love you!

LEVIN

Do you? Well, I love you!

KITTY

Oh, Konstantin!

MIX TO

DAY

BETSY

. . . and there was her husband wearing her

best ballgown, rouge all over his face . . .

ma chere, le scandale! . . . But I'd better tell

you some regimental news . . .

143

KARENIN

Who is here?

FOOTMAN

Princess Elisabeth Federovna Tverskaya,

Your Excellency.

anna (O.C.)

No--I don't want to see him.

betsy (O.C.)

. . . but your husband surely wouldn't . . .

KARENIN

Please excuse me.

ANNA

No--stay.

144

BETSY

I am so glad to see you. Everyone asks after

you.

KARENIN

You look feverish.

BETSY

We have been talking too much--so I'm

going.

ANNA

Princess Betsy came to tell me . . .

I don't want to hide anything from you . . .

Count Vronsky asked to come to say

goodbye--he's going away. I have said I

can't receive him.

BETSY

Goodbye, my treasure.

KARENIN

I agree with you. As he is going away, there

is no need for Count Vronsky to come here.

KARENIN

147

ANNA

(CRIES OUT)

All I know is that I sent him away and it's as

if I'd shot myself through the heart!

KARENIN

(PAUSE)

I see. And Serozha . . . ?

ANNA

I would die for him, but I won't live like

this for him. When he knows about love,

he'll forgive me.

KARENIN

Then I must choose the smaller sin. Vronsky

robbed me of my cloak and I will give him

my coat. I will give you grounds to divorce

me, and I'll accept the scandal, the humilia-

tion and the consequences to my career.

ANNA

No . . . I can't . . .

KARENIN

You may write to him but I would prefer

you not to see him until you have left this

house.

148

VRONSKY

You look like a boy. But so pale. We'll go

south . . . to the sea air and sunshine . . .

149

SLYUDIN

. . . and Madame Odette in person, so to speak,

Your Excellency, with your permission . . .

KARENIN

Madame Odette . . . ?

SHOPKEEPER

Excuse the liberty, Your Excellency . . . it's

for a bonnet and some ribbons Her Excel-

lency has overlooked. If you wish us to

address ourselves to Her Excellency, please

be so good as to tell us where we might . . .

150

LYDIA

I have forced my way in! I have heard!

KARENIN

Countess, every shopkeeper has heard.

LYDIA

My dear friend! Don't give way to sorrow.

Our Lord Jesus Christ has you in his care.

KARENIN

No, I'm done for. I don't understand any-

thing. All day long I'm being asked to

make decisions about bills and servants, the

kitchen, Serozha's clothes . . .

LYDIA

I understand. I understand everything. I am

going to act. The household arrangements

you can leave to me. I will come every day. I

will be a second mother to Serozha.

LYDIA (CONT'D)

He that humbleth himself shall be exalted!

You must not thank me. Thank Him whose

love pours through me!

151

TIME--DAY

SLEIGH

LEVIN

This is Agafia, and Vasili, the steward . . .

My wife, Ekaterina Alexandrovna Levin.

KITTY

I am very pleased to meet you both.

LEVIN

And that was Kuzma. Come inside!

152

VASILI

Careful--door's still a bit . . .

(to Levin's look)

it's all right, it'll be dry tomorrow . . .

DAY

LEVIN

Is it all right?

LEVIN (CONT'D)

Sit down a minute.

KITTY

No--I want to see everything.

LEVIN

A moment.

153

AGAFIA

. . . and now I'm doing kitchen maid's

work because Nadya's parents won't let her

set foot in this house, and who can blame

them!--it's indecent!

DAY

LEVIN

It's me, Konstantin.

NIKOLAI

Yes, good. The doctor here is useless--get

me a doctor from Moscow.

LEVIN

Where did you go? I asked for you every-

where, when I was getting married.

MASHA

(WHISPERS)

I'm sorry . . . I couldn't leave him. I know

I've done wrong.

154

LEVIN

Yes. My wife . . . You can't stay now.

SAME TIME-- DAY

AGAFIA

I couldn't go against Nikolai Dmitrich's

orders . . .

LEVIN

Yes--yes . . . She's going.

LEVIN (CONT'D)

Did the doctor see her?

LEVIN

I will nurse him with Agafia . . . The

woman will find somewhere in the village.

You won't see her. She knows it's impossible

for you to meet her. It is a torment to me

that I have brought you under the same roof

155

as this unfortunate . . . this fallen . . . and in

your precious, in your delicate condition . . .

SAME TIME-- DAY

KITTY

Good. A clean nightshirt and sheets. A

towel and a clean pail of warm water. Ask

Agafia for vinegar, and to prepare a bed

somewhere for Masha. Wait.

KITTY (CONT'D)

And bring the perfume bottle in the outside

pocket of my handbag.

156

LATER

KITTY

I'm not looking.

LATER--NIGHT

NIKOLAI

(WHEEZING)

I'm going . . .

157

LATER

LATER

LEVIN

Thank you, Father . . . and how much . . . ?

158

PRIEST

At your benevolence. It is a custom, not a

levy, Your Excellency . . . Jesus overturned

the money-tables outside the temple, but . . .

KITTY

You're such an expert on love, Kostya . . .

why didn't you know it when you saw it?

159

LYDIA

Alexei, they're back! Here in St. Petersburg!

She has written to me.

KARENIN

To you? . . . I think I don't have the right to

refuse . . . It's the boy's birthday . . .

LYDIA

My friend . . . you would be blowing on the

embers of a fire which must be allowed to

die . . . Let me write to her.

160

ANNA

I'm here to see Sergei Alexeyich.

TIME--DAY

ANNA

I have brought something for Sergei

Alexeyich.

KAPITONICH

He is not up yet. Would you wish to wait?

Who shall I say . . . ?

KAPITONICH (CONT'D)

Please come in, Your Excellency.

161

KAPITONICH (CONT'D)

Allow me to announce you. The tutor may

be there and not dressed.

KAPITONICH

Please allow me!

DAY

ANNA

I've come to see Sergei Alexeyich.

KAPITONICH

He's been moved to the small sitting room.

DAY

DAY

KAPITONICH

I'll just look in.

163

SEROZHA

Mama.

ANNA

Oh, my dear little boy.

SEROZHA

I knew you would come. Today is my

birthday.

SEROZHA (CONT'D)

Are you crying?

ANNA

I won't cry. It's time for you to get dressed.

And I almost forgot your present, look . . .

open it . . .

SEROZHA

You don't want that . . . Let me see.

164

SEROZHA (CONT'D)

Oh, he's grand!

DAY

KORNEY

It's your fault for letting her in!--you

should be sacked.

KAPITONICH

Oh yes, you would have sent her packing!

Ten years I've been keeping the door and

the mistress was always kind to me. You

should stick to stealing the master's clothes.

LUKICH

I've had enough of this--it's my job to get

the boy out of bed before His Excellency

comes . . .

TIME--DAY

165

ANNA

Darling Kutik, Maman can't stay . . .

SEROZHA

Don't go!--he's not coming yet.

ANNA

Yes, I must, and you must love Papa--

he's better than I am. When you're

grown-up . . .

SEROZHA

No one in the whole world is better than

you.

SAME TIME-- DAY

166

ANNA

Where's Anya?

ANNUSHKA

She's still asleep. Should I take your coat?

ANNUSHKA (CONT'D)

Are you feeling unwell, Madame?

ANNA

I'm not sleeping.

ANNUSHKA

I can send out for something.

LATER

VRONSKY

Why are you in the dark?

167

VRONSKY (CONT'D)

Yashvin is going to call . . . you remember him.

(about her clothes)

Are you going out?

ANNA

To where? To whom?

VRONSKY

What's the matter?

ANNA

I didn't know what happened to you.

VRONSKY

But I told you yesterday . . . My brother . . .

ANNA

Does it take all day for you to meet your

brother? Does he need you more than I do?

VRONSKY

What's happened?

VRONSKY (CONT'D)

Well . . . Alexander agreed to everything.

Mother's house in Moscow will go to him,

and the country estate will be our new

home . . . as soon as the divorce . . . Karenin

hasn't answered your letter yet?

168

YASHVIN

It's wonderful to have you both returned.

ANNA

How good you are to come. You're the very

first person to call on me since our return.

ANNA (CONT'D)

I received a note from Princess Betsy asking

me if I'd call on her between six-thirty and

eight. Or was it seven?

ANNA (CONT'D)

Alas, between six-thirty and seven is just

when I'm unable to see her!

YASHVIN

But perhaps you'll meet at the opera tonight?

ANNA

I would love to be there if I could get a box.

YASHVIN

(BOWS)

Madame, your box is number four! You'll

find me there with Princess Myagkaya. Will

you come, Vronsky?

169

ANNA

I see why . . . Alexei is so fond of you.

VRONSKY

You know you can't go to the theatre?

ANNA

Annushka!

VRONSKY

For heaven's sake--

ANNA

A bath. I'll come in and choose a dress.

VRONSKY

Anna--I implore you--don't you know . . . ?

ANNA

I'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've

done: are you ashamed for me? Why do

you keep a room at the hotel? Aren't we

together? Have you changed towards me?

VRONSKY

It's because I love you and care about you.

170

ANNA

If that's the case, I don't know why you

aren't coming with me.

VRONSKY

That would make it worse.

ANNA

You're afraid. Well, I'm not.

PRINCESS MYAGKAYA

Anna . . . !

princess myagkaya (cont'd)

Something has done you good--you look

wonderful.

171

NIGHT

PRINCESS MYAGKAYA

Should we visit or stay put?

ANNA

Stay put.

172

PRINCESS MYAGKAYA

Minister! Congratulations. Come in for a

moment.

princess myagkaya (cont'd)

Princess Sorokina and her daughter, they're

from Moscow, neighbours of Countess Vron-

sky, quite well off, no sons, she's a widow.

princess myagkaya (cont'd)

My dear, I'm a sales catalogue.

VRONSKY

You'll come up to see us afterwards . . . ?

ALEXANDER

Talk to Varya.

173

VRONSKY

Will you call on Anna?

VARYA

Oh, Alexei . . . I'm fond of you . . . but . . .

VRONSKY

For God's sake, Anna isn't a criminal!

VARYA

I'd call on her if she'd only broken the law.

But she broke the rules.

PRINCESS MYAGKAYA

Who has made the decor? Haven't we got

a programme? Colonel, would you be so

kind . . . ?

YASHVIN

Of course.

174

NEIGHBOUR

Please . . . I would be honoured if you would

take mine . . .

ANNA

Thank you, how very . . .

PRINCE TVERSKOY

remarkable.

HOUSE MANAGER

(BOWING)

A thousand apologies, Princess, but . . .

VRONSKY

Captain Makhotin . . .

175

WIFE'S VOICE

It's a disgrace! Take me home!

WIFE

Fetch my cloak!

WIFE

What are we coming to?

WIFE (CONT'D)

Is this the opera house or a--or a French

music hall-- ?!

176

BETSY

(SARCASTIC)

Yes, why don't you? Rescue her and put

your seal on the fiasco.

BETSY (CONT'D)

Alexei . . . you see why she must divorce.

Marriage will solve everything. When will

it be?

VRONSKY

As far as I'm concerned, she's my wife.

BETSY

But, as you saw, she isn't.

VRONSKY

We're going to Moscow, and then to my

place in the country.

BETSY

That sounds like a good idea.

VRONSKY

But for a day or two, Anna will be at home,

at my flat.

177

VRONSKY (CONT'D)

(PAUSE)

Then, I'll say goodbye now.

ANNA

. . . you had an excellent night! Does your

mother want you to marry the widow or the

child?

VRONSKY

Either one.

ANNA

Don't make a joke of it. If you loved me, you

would have locked me in to stop me going.

ANNA

Go to bed.

178

VRONSKY

Yes, it was my fault.

ANNA

I won't sleep.

VRONSKY

I know how to make you sleep.

LATER--IN BED

179

DOLLY

Anna . . . I am very glad to see you. Are you

well? How is your little one?

DOLLY (CONT'D)

Stiva wanted to invite you and Count Vron-

sky to the house but it's impossible . . .

ANNA

I understand.

DOLLY

No, no--you don't. Kitty and her husband

are with us. She's in Moscow to have the baby.

ANNA

Kitty . . . ? Oh, tell her how pleased I am . . . !

DOLLY

Perhaps I'll wait a year or two.

(she gulps a laugh)

Oh . . . love!

ANNA

Yes . . . love! Don't you disapprove of me for

what I've done?

DOLLY

No. I wish I'd done the same. But no one

asked me! Well . . . I wouldn't have been

brave enough.

(she blinks tears)

Stiva, you know . . . he doesn't change . . .

like all men, I suppose.

180

ANNUSHKA

Madame . . . Madame . . .

ANNUSHKA (CONT'D)

Are you ill?

ANNA

What time is it? Is Anya up?

181

ANNUSHKA

It's afternoon, Madame.

ANNA

I'm all right. It's all right.

(PAUSE)

Get them to bring up all our trunks and

travel cases. We've been here long enough.

ANNA

I had an inspiration. Why do we have to

wait here? Why can't we wait in the coun-

try? I don't want to hear any more about a

divorce, or think about it.

VRONSKY

Good! I'm bored here. When should we go?

ANNA

If I bore you here, I'll bore you in the

country.

VRONSKY

I didn't say you bore me. Moscow bores me.

When should we go? . . . Tomorrow?

182

ANNA

VRONSKY

ANNA

VRONSKY

ANNA

VRONSKY

ANNA

VRONSKY

183

ANNA

It's absurd to you because you have no

understanding for my life here.

VRONSKY

Anna . . . Anna . . .

ANNA

You've stopped loving me. You've given

up everything for me, and it's turned you

against me. Why lie about it?

VRONSKY

Stop. I put off our departure for a day or

two, and you tell me I don't love you.

ANNA

Because I've been living off your love and

there's none left, so this is over! Finished.

ANNA

I'm sorry. I don't mind when we go.

VRONSKY

I'll telegraph Maman. We'll go on Sunday.

I'll do anything you want.

184

ANNA

You should leave me.

VRONSKY

I don't want to. I love you.

ANNA

Why?

VRONSKY

You can't ask why about love.

VRONSKY

So--will you be all packed? I'll be out

today making the arrangements.

ANNA

Is that your way of telling me you'll be at

your mother's with that simpering little

princess?

185

VRONSKY

No. I'll be with my lawyers. I'm waiting for

some documents. Then I'm having dinner

to say goodbye to old comrades.

ANNA

Well, I know what that means.

VRONSKY

My God, this is unendurable.

VRONSKY (CONT'D)

I can invite them here if you like.

ANNA

Thank you, but if I'm not fit to dine in soci-

ety, I won't eat with the band. Who was the

telegram from?

VRONSKY

I didn't show it to you, because Stiva keeps

telegraphing what we already know. Kare-

nin promises nothing, but will consider . . .

ANNA

I told you I don't care about the divorce, so

why hide the telegram? What else do you

hide from me?

186

VRONSKY

I hide nothing from you.

ANNA

Why do you care about the divorce?

What has it got to do with us loving each

other?

VRONSKY

Until we're married, our daughter is legally

Karenin's. I care about it because we need to

be free to marry.

ANNA

You're perfectly free to marry anyone your

mother wants.

VRONSKY

But we aren't talking about--

ANNA

Yes, we are, and, by the way, compared to

your mother I'm the Virgin Mary.

VRONSKY

Is there anything you wish to say to me?

187

ANNA'S POV--

ANNA

So it's the child.

VRONSKY

She brought papers from Maman.

VRONSKY (CONT'D)

Anna?

188

ANNA

Unpack everything. We're not going.

ANNUSHKA

Anna Arkadyeva . . .

ANNA

When Count Vronsky comes back, tell

him . . . I don't want to be disturbed.

189

TIME--DAY

ANNA

Count Vronsky . . . ?

ANNUSHKA

He went out early, to the stables, he said.

ANNA

Oh, Annushka . . . I should have

died. Do you remember?

ANNUSHKA

Don't take it to heart, Anna Arkadyeva . . .

ANNA

I've made him hate me.

190

ANNA

Tell Michael to hurry.

MICHAEL

Count Vronsky had already left, Your Excel-

lency. He took a cab to the station . . . to the

Countess.

191

ANNA

Are you waiting for the Princess Sorokina?

192

COACHMAN

No, Your Excellency, both princesses are at

the house of Countess Vronsky. I'm waiting

FOR HIM--

Look at that lace on her . . .

LEVIN

I'll be buying in feed before winter's over.

THEODORE

Well, you don't press people hard, but you

live rightly, for your soul, not your belly.

LEVIN

My soul! What's that? I know what my

belly is. How do we know what's rightly?

I believe in reason.

194

THEODORE

Reason? And was it reason that made you

chose a wife?

LEVIN

(PAUSE)

No.

THEODORE

You're a great one for reasoning, Konstantin

Dmitrich, but what's rightly is outside your

mathematic--that's what's rightly about it!

something . . .

KITTY

And what was that?
