fucking President. I'm your goddamn

chauffeur!

TWINS

(each taking alternate,

overlapping lines)

Shit, man. It wasn't our fault! --

You think Sis is so perfect, well,

bathroom, maybe we -- I thought Aunt

Lu was dead! She was in there so

long...

LT

Shut up! Listen!

TWINS

(in unison)

LT

Shit, man -- there's your fucking

the nuns whack the shit outa ya both.

LT

Get going.

CUT TO:

BET COP

Two Black kids came up out of nowhere

and shot those chicks. Then they

laughed as they walked away. The

Press is gonna call it the "Giggling

Man Murders." I'll tell ya. What a

world.

BET COP

But hey -- we make the best of it,

man, don't we? Huh? How about them

Mets!

CUT TO:

LT

No fucking way they're gonna do it

in four games straight.

COP ONE

You serious, man? I wanna go Mets

all the way!

LT

Go ahead, man.If you've got shit for

brains. But if you wanna win the

bucks, go with Oakland.

COP TWO

I thought Strawberry was gonna --

LT

I know that nigger like he's my

brother. He ain't gonna let us off

so easy. He'll make us sweat first.

This game's going to Oakland. Not a

doubt in my mind, man.

BET COP

I'm in. Here.

CUT TO:

LT

(into the phone)

I got them all going for Oakland.

With bullshit money. We'll cover the

$800.

LITE

(OC)

All right. What are you gonna do?

LT

I want 15 on the Mets.

LITE

(OC)

How about 7 1/2?

LT

Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit.

Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are

a fucking lock. I wanna make some

money.

LITE

Are you sure?

LT

Yeah. I'm sure.

BUSINESSMAN

Police! Police! Help me! Police!

CUT TO:

LT

Hey, man, gimme something cooked!

LT

It's good shit. From when they busted

those Columbians uptown. You can cut

it in half.

LT

I got this guy. But there's someone

across the street on the roof!

JC

That stuff'll kill you quick, man.

LT

What the fuck are you? A drug

counselor or a drug dealer? And you

don't even do your own product! What

kind of businessman are you?

JC

The rich kind.

(shakes his head)

Jeez, man. The way you smoke that

shit is suicide.

LT

Fuck you.

(takes a deep hit)

Just give me back a little something

for the road.

JC

See you in a coupla days. Have the

cash ready.

CUT TO:

ARIANE

Got something good for us?

ARIANE

I'm gonna need some bread, man. This

ain't fair. I'm always here for you,

and you can't even take decent care

of me. My landlord is bitching like

a motherfucker! You're two months

behind on the rent, Lieutenant!

LT

Didya ever think of moving to a

cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is

crazy, man!

ARIANE

It's nothing. This is New York, man...

(beat)

Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some

cash to buy her new acting headshots

out of the developers. It's a good

investment, man. She could make

serious money!

ARIANE

We've been rehearsing a new monologue.

From Shad's Saint Joan, you know?

Bowtay does it wonderfully well.

LT

All right, Bowtay. Show us your stuff.

CUT TO:

ARIANE

(OC - calling to LT)

There's nothing!

ARIANE

(OC - calling to LT)

Go out and get some Diet Cokes.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LT

(to Cop)

What's going on?

COP

Uh, Lieutenant, Sir -- The owner

says they stole cash from the

register. He was chasing them down

the block when I caught up with them.

YOUNG BLACK KID

We didn't do nothing, man !

LT

Shut the fuck up!

LT

(to Cop)

Go get me a Bud. A High Boy. And

make sure it's fucking cold.

(indicates the

situation at hand)

I'll straighten this out.

LT

How much did they take?

KOREAN OWNER

Five hundred dollars cash.

YOUNG BLACK KID

We didn't --

LT

(orders the Cop)

Take this guy down to the Precinct.

I need to talk to him.

LT

Gimme the money! Now!

YOUNG BLACK KID

We told you, man. We didn't take no --

LT

Give me the fucking money, assholes!

LT

What the fuck are ya standing there

for? Be gone!

LT

Take over until your boss gets back.

Gimme a 6 of Diet Cokes and a 6 of

Budweiser.

CUT TO:

ARIANE

I got you a present. Better shit

then you got, cop!

LT

Brown Downtown... There hasn't been

any smoking brown on the street in --

ARIANE

Who said anything about the fucking

street. I've got more connects than

you have, Lieutenant...

DISSOLVE TO:

HARD CUT TO:

DAY TWO:

GAME FOUR: LT LOSES $15,000

LT

Did I win? Shit! The game!

LT

(to background family

members)

What's the score? What's the fucking

score?

ANCIENT AUNT

I dunno...

LT

(to himself)

Why me, man?

LT

(to the Twins)

Shut the fuck up! Did you see that?

TWINS

(shrug - in unison)

It's 7-0: Oakland.

(single Twin)

That nigger could have let it drop

and gone home.

CUT TO:

HARD CUT TO:

LT

Hey, Veronica baby, looking good!

What's going down?

VERONICA

(confidentially - to

LT)

Willie got shot by one of his boys.

(giggles)

But there's a ki under the back seat.

LT

I'll put it in my trunk.

LT

(soft, sardonic)

I guess he was a bigtime dealer...

(beat)

What d'ya know... A kilo of 'caine...

SERGEANT

Where the fuck did that come from?

LT

(to himself)

I can't fucking believe it...

COP A

But I still can't fucking believe

they'd rape a nun, man...

LT

(to the Cops)

What's this shit about a nun getting

raped?

COP B

Where the fuck have you been? It

happened this morning, up at St.

Dominiek's in Spanish Harlem. A coupla

punks tore up the place and then

gave it to the nuns but good.

CUT TO:

LT

What's going on?

FIRST COP

They raped a nun and tore up the

church -- they even took a crap on

the altar. Up in Spanish Harlem.

SECOND COP

She was only seventeen...

FIRST COP

Who the fuck could do this?!

OLD IRISH COP

The young nun's just a kid from

Ireland. Imagine having to come here

to have that happen!

SECOND COP

Jesus... What's she gonna tell her

mother?

OLD IRISH COP

I'm gonna kill those motherfuckers.

THIRD COP

The Church already put up a $50,000

reward!

FIRST COP

Well, one of us is gonna get it. I

mean -- get them.

FIRST COP

Here's to payback for the nuns!

SECOND COP

Anyone got any leads, at all?

FIRST COP

We got shit to go on. Only that list

of inventory -- what they stole from

the church.

THIRD COP

Y'know they actually stole those

wacky purple robes? And they took

the chalice -- with the Host still

inside!

SECOND COP

What did they want with the Host?

THIRD COP

They were hungry. I dunno. They didn't

want to hock the Host, they wanted

to hock that golden chalice.

LT

Leave it to the Catholic Church,

man. Girls get raped everyday, and

now they're gonna pay 50 G just

because these chicks wore penguin

suits!

OLD IRISH COP

(to LT)

What's your fucking problem?!

LT

The Church is a racket.

OLD IRISH COP

So what. Are you a Catholic?

LT

Sure!

OLD IRISH COP

Do you believe in God?

BET COP

(to LT)

To Hell with this God stuff. How's

that Strawberry? He does what ever

you want him to, huh Lieutenant?

Even strike out!

(beat)

I bet you won a shitload on Oakland.

How much, huh?

LT

More than you did.

GAMBLER COP TWO

Well, let's see some green!

LT

If you know what's good for you,

you'll keep staying on Oakland!

BET COP

Oakland? Is that how you're going?

LT

Yeah. Sure. Don't you get it? The

series has gotta last seven games.

The last two did, didn't they? It's

a racket. Do you have any idea how

much money they make selling

television-time for commercials during

the series? Especially if it's a New

York team? They won't close the gold

mine after only four games. It'll

last a full seven. Too many people

wanna milk it for what it's worth.

You'll see!

BET COP

All right... I'm in. After all, you're

the expert. Ain't that right, LT?

LT

You'll be sorry, man. But if you

wanna be a sissy, here's your bread.

COP ONE

Strawberry? I thought we were going

with Oakland.

LT

We are, man! That's the point! If

the Mets win, it's thanks to

Strawberry. If Oakland wins, it's

thanks to Strawberry. Nothing can

happen out there on the field that

don't gotta do with Strawberry. So

here's to Strawberry!

CUT TO:

NURSE

Can I help you?

LT

I'm in charge of the investigation.

Just checking security.

NURSE

(Suspicious)

Security?

LT

Do you want those guys coming back?

For the nun? Or for you?

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

(to Female Cop)

They inserted a crucifix eleven

centimeters into her vaginal aperture,

breaking the hymen membrane. Then

they pursued the same course with

their natural organs of sexual

penetration. They used a sharp object,

probably a hunting knife with a curved

blade, to carve a cross between her

shoulder blades, entering the flesh

an average of nearly one centimeter

throughout the area of the wound.

They --

CUT TO:

LT

Have you ever seen a naked nun? I

tell you, man, I went to school with

the nuns, I've seen hundreds since

then and I've never even seen a nun's

belly button, you understand? But

this nun, let me tell you. What a

beautiful lady...

(snaps out of his awe)

And where'd the Church get the 50 G

in the first place? The fucking Church

is the biggest scam going. You know

what's the real killer? It costs

$8,000 per kid for them to go to

parochial school. I've got three

kids in there already, with two on

the way! Christ. That fucking reward

is my money, man! But that's Church

policy. The Pope is the world's

biggest bookie. Makes people bet on

their own salvation! Double or nothing

on Heaven. You go to Hell -- then go

to Hell. In the beginning was the

Word, and the Word was bullshit.

ARIANE

I can't get over what those guys did

to her. I just can't.

LT

They're alive, aren't they? Come on,

man! Everyone's making such a fucking

fuss, just because she's a nun. Just

because she wears a penguin suit,

the church puts up 50 G for the guys

who dared to rape her. Do you think

they'd put up a dime if you got raped?

Of course not. Or even for your little

sister? The virgin? Like shit they

would.

ARIANE

Susie's not a virgin anymore.

LT

She's fucking nine years old! Jesus

Christ.

ARIANE

And the nun's not a virgin anymore,

either. Will they make her leave the

convent?

LT

Who knows? Who knows what their policy

is.

(sudden dreamy

reverence)

But I'll tell you, man, that nun...

She was beautiful. Just beautiful...

Tall... Real tall... I've never seen

anything like it...

LT

(to himself)

Lite, man... Where the fuck are you?

ARIANE

It's horrible. They burned her breasts

with cigarettes. Christ.

LT

Yeah? At least she's alive! I see

people get killed every day! Worse

yet, tortured first and then killed!

The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette

burns. Everyone's all upset about

fucking cigarette burns. I'll show

you cigarette burns!

ARIANE

Do you believe in God? Do you believe

that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?.

LT

(to LITE; over the

phone)

Yeah, I know, I know all about it.

Enough already about the fucking

nuns. Yeah. Yeah. So just take the

bet. Don't give me any hassles, man.

Just put in my bet. 30 G's. Yeah.

And I got $900 from the cops on

Oakland. Yeah. Right. Strawberry's

gonna knock em dead. Of course he

is! You know that! Yeah. Yeah. Have

faith, man! OK. Right.

ARIANE

Do you believe in God?

LT

The Church is a fucking racket. I

know how they operate. I've been

part of the racket since the first

time some faggot priest spilt water

on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was

crying all the way through. Yeah, I

know their game inside out. Now I'm

free of it and I'm gonna stay that

way.

ARIANE

I'm not talking about the fucking

Church. Fuck the Church. But tell

me. Do you believe in God?

LT

What's to believe?

ARIANE

That Jesus Christ was the Son of God

and he came to die for your sins.

ARIANE

Your sins, Lieutenant!

(beat)

And look around you! Where do you

think all this shit came from?

LT

People.

ARIANE

You believe that man is the be-all

and end-all?

LT

Yeah.

ARIANE

OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe

in God?

LT

I believe in God the Father Almighty,

Creator of Heaven and Earth...

CUT TO:

LT

You wouldn't put some religious trip

on me, would you?

JERSEY GIRL

Uh-uh... What?

LT

Good. Show me your papers.

LT

Who's this person? It ain't you, and

it ain't you, so who is it?

GIRL

My Aunt.

LT

So you took the car from you Aunt.

Stole it. Am I right?

GIRL

We were gonna give it back! We're on

our way home, now!

LT

Yeah, yeah.

LT

Now why don't I just call up your

Aunt right now and tell her what's

gone down. How about that?

LT

Well, I'm sure we could arrange

something... Unless you fancy a few

days in jail...

CUT TO:

DAY THREE:

GAME FIVE: LT LOSES $30,000

CUT TO:

COP 1

Can't you tell us anything? Sisters?

Anything at all?

ELDERLY NUN

They broke my glasses. I didn't see

anything, but I did hear them. They

were young. And there were two of

them. They spoke Spanish. One of

them was named Julio.

LT

(to Older Cop)

Julio. Great. There are 20,000 spics

named "Julio".

ELDERLY NUN

I would tell you more if I could. I

am so sorry, Officers.

COP 2

What about you, Sister? Won't you

tell us anything?

MONSIGNOR

Listen. One nun is nearly 80 years

old. I'm not from this Church, of

course, but I assume they'll be

getting her a new pair of glasses.

Apparently she's legally blind without

them. The Sister who suffered a rape

is just 17. She arrived from Ireland

only a couple of months ago. This --

event -- is just too much for them

to take!

MONSIGNOR

Listen. The Church would like to

know who did it just as much as the

NYPD. These arrant criminals broke

the laws of man, and the laws of

God. The Church wants nothing more

than to see them behind bars. That's

why we're offering the $50,000 reward

to whomever brings them in. I'm sure

our hero will be one of New York's

Finest.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LITE

OK asshole. You owe thirty grand.

Now what are you gonna do?

LT

I wanna go double or nothing on the

next game.

LITE

Double or nothing? Are you fucking

out of your mind?

LT

I'm not gonna let that bastard take

my money

LITE

Take your money? This guy will blow

up your house and everyone in it!

LT

(stoic)

There's just no way the Mets will

lose this game. Gooden is pitching

and Strawberry is ready to break

out.

LITE

Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up

owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!

LT

That's my problem. Just put in my

bet.

HARD CUT TO:

NUN

Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.

It has been two days since my last

confession. Father, my sin is a

terrible sin. A sin of omission.

There was another sin that happened

at the same time, and in the same

place, but my sin I think was graver

stil.

PRIEST

Sister, we all know what happened to

you yesterday morning. I expected

that you would want to speak to me

about it. But you could have come to

my office. Your being here, in the

confessional, implies that you,

Sister, have done something wrong.

You haven't. I assure you. I feared

you might have misplaced feelings of

guilt. If you condemn yourself because

you experienced feelings of...

curiosity or even... pleasure, you

mustn't --

NUN

Father, if it was so trivial, so

natural, so -- No. I have sinned.

And you must listen if you are to

prescribe an appropriate act of

contrition, and to absolve me. Father,

what would you do if you had but one

day in which to use your arms to

serve God?

PRIEST

It's funny, you knew. But the first

thing I think of is kneading the

bread that I help bake for the soup

kitchen. Maybe that's because my the

muscles in my arms still hurt.

NUN

I also thought of that bread, Father.

And of that night six days ago when

the Mother Superior died, and I kept

the cool, damp cloth on her forehead

freshly moist. Father, what would

you do if you had but one day in

which to use your legs to serve God?

PRIEST

I think of running for help, and

falling to my knees in prayer.

NUN

As I have prayed day and night since

the desecration of this church

yesterday morning -- and my sin. You

see, Father --

PRIEST

Yes, Sister?

NUN

Yesterday morning, God gave me but

one chance to use something else to

serve Him. Not my arms or my legs,

but something I used for the first

time, for the last time, and will

never use again. My vagina.

NUN

Those boys, those sad, raging boys...

They came to me as the needy do. And

like many of the needy, they were

rude. Like all the needy, they took.

And like all the needy, they needed.

(beat)

Father. I knew them; They learn in

our school. And play in our

schoolyard. And they are good boys.

PRIEST

You knew them?

(beat)

Who were they, Sister? Who are these

boys? What are the names of these --

good boys you knew?

NUN

I could tell you their names now,

and I know you'd be bound by a sacred

vow to keep my secret. But I cannot

tell you their names. For I, too, am

bound. As I am bound now to confess

my sins. So listen, Father Listen.

(beat)

I am a nun. What did I give those

boys that they could not have found

elsewhere? Nothing. Nothing at all.

There were always two of us in the

act. The act was half my own. It

does not seem to me the act was half

the act of a once of Christ.

(beat)

It is the lost chance that will remain

on the ledger of my sins. Not the

loss of my virginity. The rape forced

upon me a choice. As a vessel of the

spirit. I could have imbued my vagina

with God. Or, I could have turned

away from God and voided my body of

spirit, so that all that was left

for those boys was a lump of flesh.

I chose the second path. The easier,

path. The path of the material world.

The path no nun has the right to

take. And so, I sinned.

(beat)

My vagina spread, but spread no word.

It opened, on nothingness. It gave

nothing at all and left nothing

behind. No trace of my act, yes my

act. For I was there, too, remains

in the landscape of God.

NUN

Jesus turned water to wine. I ought

to have turned bitter semen to fertile

sperm -- hatred to love. And maybe

to have saved their souls. They did

not love me. I ought to have loved

them. As Jesus loved those who reviled

him. I ought to have surprised those

boys. Instead, they surprised me,

and got no surprise at all. No, they

did not rape a nun. But a nun has

been raped. And the nun must now

atone for her sin. For a God-given

part of her was wasted. A part which

other women use for procreation, for

conjugal fulfillment, for expressions

of love. I had but one chance. And I

did nothing but react in pain.

(beat)

When those boys placed their hands

upon my breasts, they had nothing

but an assortment of skin cells in

their grasp. They ought to have felt,

through me. The bosom of their

Redeemer. When they lay on top of me

and looked down into my eyes, they

saw fear. They should have met the

eyes of a lover, And felt the presence

of the Prince of Peace...

(beat)

My vagina. I shall never have again.

And never again shall I encounter

two boys whose prayer was more

legible, more poignant, more

anguished. Two young men who threw

themselves upon the altar and took

me with them. And I did nothing for

them. I can only hope that someone

will.

FADE UP TO:

CUT TO:

LITE

Do you have the money?

LT

(giggles)

What money?

LITE

Don't bullshit me.

LT

I don't got it. Not tonight. You

can't get blood from a stone.

LITE

This psycho can.

LT

Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just

put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.

LITE

(laughs in his face)

You're a fucking joke, you know that?

(turns grim)

He's been waiting for the money since

the fucking game ended. And I've

been waiting here since -- forget

it. Listen up. You're gonna get us

both fucking killed. You know that!

LT

Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure

the bet gets in.

LITE

You do know that he's gonna blow up

your house, kill your wife and kids --

LT

Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand

for his trouble. I hate that

motherfucking house and --

LITE

He's gonna kill you, man. Do you

hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead.

Get it?

LT

I've been dodging bullets since I

was fourteen. No one can kill me.

I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking

Catholic.

LITE

How's the case going?

LT

What case?

LITE

The fucking rapists, man. The punks

who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward

from the Church! Remember?

LT

Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime.

Lots of leads. You bet.

LITE

That 50 G could help you --

LT

The Mets are gonna win the Series.

They're a lock.

LT

Get this, man. I was at the game

today. Face to fucking face with

Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him

strikeout. And you know what? He

looked at me, and I looked at him,

and he laughed and I laughed and it

was like we were all alone in that

whole stadium and only we understood

that it was all a racket, that he

struck out on purpose, and that he's

saving it up for the Big One.

Tomorrow. Today I understood for the

very first time that --

LITE

You've really got a problem.

LT

-- that there was never any other

way it could have gone.

(beat)

Never any other way. So you had better

just put in my fucking bet. $120,000

on the last game. The Big One. Come

on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking

what?

LITE

Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's

number You call him yourself and

tell him wnat you want.

LITE

You couldn't pay 60. You lose, you'll

be in for 180. To a guy who kills

people for nothing.

LITE

I was supposed to meet him at midnight

with the 60. It's already 1:00 AM.

Be careful. I mean it.

What about the money you owe me on

yesterday's game?

LT

Fuck yesterday's game. The World

Series is seven games not six. Put

in my bet.

LARGE

(OC)

Let me think about it.

LT

There's nothing to think about. Either

you put in my bet or you ain't getting

nothing.

LARGE

(CO -- lethal)

Oh, really?

LT

Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole,

man. I'm a fucking cop!

LARGE

(OC)

OK, cop. I want you to give yourself

and your friends on the force a

message. Tell them I've got my own

reasons to be very interested in

whomever did the job on the nuns.

I'll double the Church reward if you

bring those punks direct to me. 100

G cash. Get it?

LT

Fuck the nuns, man! I'm talking about

Strawberry! Is the bet down?

LARGE

(OC)

Here's the deal: You meet me tonight

across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th.

At the beginning of the Ninth Inning.

We'll listen to the end of the game

together. You bring your cash, I'll

bring mine.

LT

Yeah, sucker. You better be there!

LT

Can you believe the nerve of this

fucking guy? He kills people for

fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to

bring in some guys who raped a nun.

What a sick fuck. Man...

ARIANE

Who?

LT

A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the

rapists if I turn then over direct

to him.

ARIANE

But you could do it, baby. We could

use the bread...

LT

You mean you could use it.

LT

I got it, man! I will find those

kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the

Church! Then the kids'll go to jail.

I'll be in charge, of course. After

a little while, I'll break the fuckers

out -- and I'll turn them in to

shithead I was just talking to. And

pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him

up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it --

'cause I've got the kids. Then, of

course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna

pick up on the Game tonight -- when

the Strawberries win!

ARIANE

"The Strawberries"?

LT

The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another

180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ!

That's almost half a million dollars.

Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough,

I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for

the kids. Then it'll be a perfect

500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G

for the kids. Yeah, it's good I

prepared, or I wouldn't have thought

to --

ARIANE

(cuts in)

How come all those guys who're looking

to get 50 from the Church haven't

come up with shit? You got some kinda

inside track?

LT

(nods -- dead serious)

I'm a Catholic.

CUT TO:

DAY FIVE:

GAME SEVEN: LT GETS DOUBLE OR NOTHING: $120,000

LT

Listen to me, Sister, listen to me

good. The other cops'll just put the

guys through the system. They're

juveniles. They'll walk! Get it? But

I'll beat the system and do justice.

Real justice. For you.

NUN

I have already forgiven them.

LT

Come on lady! They put out cigarettes

on your tits, man! Get with the

program! Don't you want them behind

bars? Or away from the world for

good? How could you forgive these

motherfu -- excuse me. These guys.

How could you? Deep down, don't you

want them to pay for what they did

to you? Don't you want the crime

avenged?

NUN

I have forgiven them.

LT

Nun! These boys still have their

weapons, Sister. Your forgiveness

will leave blood in its wake. What

if they do it to other nuns? Other

virgins? Old women who die from the

shock? Do you have the rights let

these boys go free? Can you bear the

burden. Sister?

NUN

I have prayed for days, Lieutenant.

I have prayed for the souls of the

boys who raped me. And I have prayed

for my own soul, too. I know what I

must do. And I know what I must not

do.

(beat)

But you -- you -- it is you who needs

to pray. Now, why do you want to

kill these boys? Why -- really?

LT

(takes yet another

tack)

Look. Sister. No one has to get

killed. We can solve this together.

You and me -- as one. These boys are

lost sheep. Both Catholic -- did you

know that? And they're sick, Sister.

With a stress of the mind and of the

soul. They need help. Not just jail.

Not just psychiatry. They need the

help that only the Church can give.

Please help me to help them. Help me

find them before the others do. The

night is full of evil men, chasing

these boys with guns and clubs. We

have charity and love on our side. I

know that together, we could find

them first, even in the dark...

NUN

The good reasons are not always the

real reasons. Talk to Jesus,

Lieutenant. Pray.

(beat)

You do you believe in God -- don't

you? That Jesus Christ died for your

sins?

JESUS

(OC)

I forgive you.

LT

Me?

JESUS

(OC)

I forgive you.

LT

You can't forgive me. After what

I've done.

(beat)

I've fucked up bigtime. I've been

bad. Real bad.

JESUS

I forgive you.

LT

Please. Please don't forgive me.

I've always hated you for that.

JESUS

I forgive you.

LT

Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me!

Please! Help me!

(confused)

Hate me! Help me! Hate me!

JESUS

I forgive you.

LT

Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash

the ashes from my forehead, year

after year after year? And why am I

still drunk on your blood, the taste

of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of

all, why can't I feel the nails in

my palms, the spear in my side, the

crown of thorns round my head? Why

do I have to know, over and over,

that it was you. You who died; died

for my sins! And that I will die for

nothing. Why?

JESUS

I forgive you.

LT

Why do I dream every night of the

whore who brought you water on your

road to death? And why have I never

forgotten that if she, then I --

LT

Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to

be good. Forgive me. Father, for I

have sinned. It's still goddamn good

to be good.

JESUS

I forgive you.

LT

The chalice. Tell me! Who gave it to

you! Tell me where the fuck you got

it! Take me there! Now!

ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN

I can't tell you.

LT

In the name of God, you must.

ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN

My husband will give me Hell, Mister.

LT

We've already got Hell, Sister.

ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN

It's very hard. He's a -- you're not

a cop, are you?

LT

No. Not a cop.

ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN

My husband is a fence. He got this

chalice from a couple of kids. Just

yesterday, I think. I stole it out

of his shop so as to return it to

where it ought to be. It's a holy

thing, you know. A holy thing.

LT

A holy thing.

(beat -- snaps to)

Let's go.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FENCE

You took the chalice.

ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN

Yes.

FENCE

You brought it back to the Church.

And then it made it's way back to

me, again.

ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN

Yes.

ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN

Are you all right, honey?

FENCE

I was gonna bring it back myself.

FENCE

Jesus, woman! What did you think?

You thought I'd get mad like I did

that time you took that set of pots

and pans? That was twenty years ago.

And how do you compare pots and pans

and a chalice?

LT

They both hold stuff you eat.

FENCE

(to LT)

So what are you doing here?

ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN

He wants to know who brought in the

chalice.

FENCE

That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo

brought it in,

(beat)

You don't want to hurt those boys,

do you? I mean, they sure as Hell

have got something coming, but it

ain't what the Law wants to give

them. You understand?

(beat -- shakes his

head)

No. How could you understand.

FENCE

Well -- maybe you do. But I don't

know where those boys are at right

now. You'll have to ask around. Those

boys on the corner'll know. You'll

have to get it out of them. But they

know.

LT

(spaced)

Thank you. And I'll make sure the

chalice gets back where it belongs.

CUT TO:

LT

Hey -- Have you seen Paolo or Julio

around?

STREET DEALER

What the fuck you want.

LT

You know, my Uncle used to wear a

walkman all the time. The walkman

looked just like yours. And you look

something like my Uncle. But one day

he was standing in a puddle -- the

puddle locked just like that one --

STREET DEALER

And what?

LT

And he got electrocuted.

LT

Look -- I don't know you, and you

don't know me, but I'm really in the

mood to kill someone today and you

are at the end of my gun.

(beat)

Have you ever had days like that?

Yeah, you have, so now you understand

where I'm coming from.

(beat)

Tell me! Where is Julio and Paolo ?

STREET DEALER

They were at that abandoned building

last night. Second floor. They're

probably still there now. It's next

to the old Convent. Downtown a ways.

You know the place...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JULIO

Who the fu--

LT

Shut up. Let's watch the game.

LT

Strawberry...

PAOLO

Yeah...

LT

Give me the robes.

JULIO

You're not a cop are you?

LT

No.

CUT TO:

LT

Jesus died for your sins, you

motherfuckers! Not me. No. I didn't

die for your sins. No, not me. Jesus

went and did it.

(beat)

So why did you do what you did? If

you want to live, tell me now,

motherfuckers! Tell me now!

LT

I forgive you.

CUT TO:

LT

Get out.

LT

If you think you're not getting on

this bus, you're dead wrong. No

fucking way are you gonna miss this

bus, man! You were probably the kind

of kids who had your father drive

you to school cause you couldn't

catch the fucking bus. But no more,

man. You're getting on this bus and

you're taking it to the last fucking

stop. So get on the fucking bus,

man, 'cause you're life ain't worth

shit in this town.

CUT TO:

FIN
