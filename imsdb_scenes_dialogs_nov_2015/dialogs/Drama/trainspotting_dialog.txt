Danny Boyle

RENTON

(voice-over)

Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family,

Choose a fucking big television, Choose washing machines, cars,

compact disc players, and electrical tin openers.

RENTON

(v.o)

Choose good health, low cholesterol and dental insurance. Choose

fixed-interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose

your friends.

RENTON

(v.o)

Choose leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose a three piece

suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY

and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on

that couch watching mind-numbing sprit-crushing game shows,

stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at

the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing

more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you

have spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life.

But who would I want to do a thing like that?

RENTON

(v.o)

I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the

reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got

heroin?

SICK BOY

Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better

than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative

poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course,

Thunderball was a notable success.

RENTON

(v.o)

People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and

all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget -

is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all,

we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid.

Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and

you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only

one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to

worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get

pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance

of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about

bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking

winds, about human relationships and all the things that really

don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.

SICK BOY

I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every

sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster,

but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic

lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.

RENTON

(v.o)

The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you

have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -

BEGBIE

No way would I poison my body with that shite, all they fucking

chemicals, no fucking way.

TOMMY

It's a waste of your life, Rents, poisoning your body with that

shite.

FATHER

Every chance you've ever had, you've blown it, stuffing your veins

with that filth.

GAV

Get off that stuff, Rents and get a job. It's not as bad as it

looks. While you're here, you don't fancy buying a cooker, do you?

RENTON

(v.o)

From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.

SWANNEY

Are you serious?

RENTON

Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.

SWANNEY

Well, it's up to you.

RENTON

I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and

get off it for good.

SWANNEY

Sure, sure. I've heard it before.

RENTON

The Sick Boy method.

SWANNEY

Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.

RENTON

He's always been lacking in moral fibre.

SWANNEY

He knows a lot about Sean Connery.

RENTON

That's hardly a substitute.

SWANNEY

you'll need one more hit.

RENTON

No, I don't think so.

SWANNEY

To see you through the night that lies ahead.

RENTON

(v.o)

We called him the mother superior on account of the length of his

habit. He knew all about it. On it, off it, he knew it all. Of

course I'd have another shot: after all, I had work to do.

RENTON

(v.o)

Relinquishing junk. Stage One: preparation. For this you will

need: one room which you will not leave; one mattress; tomato

soup, ten tins of; mushroom soup, eight tins of, for consumption

cold; ice cream, vanilla, one large tub of; Magnesia, Milk of, one

bottle; paracetamol; mouth wash; vitamins; mineral water;

Lucozade; pornography; one bucket for urine, one for feces, and

one for vomitus; one television; and one bottle of Valium, which I

have already procured, from my mother, who is, in her own domestic

and socially acceptable way, also a drug addict.

And now I'm ready. All I need is a final hit to soothe the pain

while the Valium takes effect.

RENTON

Mikey. It's Mark Renton. Can you help me out?

RENTON

(v.o)

This was typical of Mikey Forrester.

(on screen)

What the fuck are these?

(v.o)

Under the normal run of things I would have had nothing to do with

the cunt, but this was not the normal run of things.

MIKEY

Opium suppositories. Ideal for your purpose. Slow release, like.

Bring you down gradually. Custom fucking designed for your needs.

RENTON

I want a fucking hit.

MIKEY

That's all I've got: take it or leave it.

Feel better now?

RENTON

For all the good they've done me I might as well have stuck them

up my arse.

RENTON

(v.o)

Heroin makes you constipated. The heroin from my last hit is

fading away and the suppositories have yet to melt. I am no longer

constipated.

RENTON

(v.o)

I fantasize about massive pristine convenience.

(v.o)

Brilliant gold taps, virginal white marble, a seat carved from

ebony, a cistern full of Chanel No. 5, and a flunky handing me

pieces of raw silk toilet roll. But under the circumstances I'll

settle for anywhere.

RENTON

Now. Now I'm ready.

SICK BOY

You Only Live Twice?

RENTON

Nineteen-sixty-seven.

SICK BOY

Running time?

RENTON

One hundred and sixteen minutes.

SICK BOY

Director?

RENTON

Lewis Gilbert.

SICK BOY

Screenwriter?

RENTON

Eh - Ian Fleming?

SICK BOY

Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.

RENTON

OK, so who was it, then?

SICK BOY

You can look it up.

How are you feeling since you came off the skag? For myself, I'm

bored.

RENTON

Who wrote it?

SICK BOY

But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant

even.

RENTON

You don't know, do you?

SICK BOY

And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.

RENTON

The park?

SICK BOY

Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.

RENTON

Who wrote it?

SICK BOY

Roald Dahl.

RENTON

Roald Dahl. Fuck me.

RENTON

(v.o)

The down side of coming off junk was that I knew I would need to

mix with my friends again in a state of full consciousness. It was

awful: they reminded me so much of myself I could hardly bear to

look at them. Take Sick Boy, for instance, he came off junk at the

same time as me, not because he wanted too, you understand, but

just to annoy me, just to show me how easily he could do it,

thereby downgrading my own struggle. Sneaky fucker, don't you

think? And when all I wanted to do was lie along and feel sorry

for myself, he insisted on telling me once again about his

unifying theory of life.

SICK BOY

It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.

RENTON

What do you mean?

SICK BOY

Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's

gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it

and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -

RENTON

Some of his solo stuff's not bad.

SICK BOY

No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your

heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's

actually just shite.

RENTON

So who else?

SICK BOY

Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -

RENTON

OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?

SICK BOY

All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the

Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward

trajectory.

RENTON

What about The Untouchables?

SICK BOY

I don't rate that at all.

RENTON

Despite the Academy award?

SICK BOY

That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.

RENTON

SICK BOY

Yeah.

RENTON

That's your theory?

SICK BOY

Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.

RENTON

Give me the gun.

SICK BOY

Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?

RENTON

Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant

problem.

SICK BOY

For a vegetarian, Rents, you're a fucking evil shot.

RENTON

(v.o)

Without heroin, I attempted to lead a useful and fulfilling life

as a good citizen.

RENTON

Good luck, Spud.

SPUD

Cheers.

RENTON

Now remember --

SPUD

Yeah.

RENTON

If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of

that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your

Giro is fucking finished, right?

SPUD

Right.

RENTON

But try too hard --

SPUD

And you might get the fucking job.

RENTON

Exactly.

SPUD

Nightmare.

RENTON

It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.

SPUD

My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer

any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a

footballer.

RENTON

Try this.

SPUD

A little dab of speed is just the ticket.

MAN 1

Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh

College.

RENTON

Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.

MAN 1

One of Edinburgh's finest schools.

RENTON

Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness

and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft

know of willow on leather --

MAN 1

I'm an old boy myself, you know?

RENTON

Oh, really?

MAN 1

Do you recall the school motto?

RENTON

Of course, the motto, the motto --

MAN 1

Strive, hope, believe and conquer.

RENTON

Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is,

after all, a dark and often hostile world.

MAN 2

Mr. Renton --

RENTON

Yes.

MAN 2

You seem eminently suited to this post but I wonder if you could

explain the gaps in your employment record?

RENTON

Yes, I can. The truth -- well, the truth is that I've had a

long-standing problem with heroin addiction. I've been know to

sniff it, smoke it, swallow it, stick it up my arse and inject it

into my veins. I've been trying to combat this addiction, but

unless you count social security scams and shoplifting, I haven't

had a regular job in years. I feel it's important to mention this.

SPUD

No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you

wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College

instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in

this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather

than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but

what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When?

Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one,

but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right?

That I am.

MAN 1

Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?

SPUD

Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?

MAN 1

You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no

need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.

SPUD

Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the

governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But

obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I

don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?

MAN 2

Mr. Murphy, what attracts you to the leisure industry?

SPUD

In a word, pleasure. My pleasure in other people's leisure.

WOMAN

What do you see as your main strengths?

SPUD

I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I

think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.

WOMAN

Homeless people?

SPUD

No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my

mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes

over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having

a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face,

right --

WOMAN

Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as

having any weaknesses?

SPUD

No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me,

it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be

bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to

me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects,

a lot of things to think about, for all of us.

MAN 1

Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.

SPUD

The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.

RENTON

(v.o)

Spud had done well. I was proud of him. He fucked up good and

proper.

SPUD

A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only

fear, compadre.

RENTON

Another dab?

SPUD

Would not say no, would not say no.

BEGBIE

(v.o)

Picture the scene. Wednesday morning in the Volley. Me and Tommy

are playing pool. No problems, and I'm playing like Paul fucking

Newman by the way. I'm giving the boy here the tanning of a

lifetime. So anyway, it comes to the final ball, the deciding shot

of the tournament: I'm on the black and he's sitting in the

corner, looking all biscuit-arsed. Then this hard cunt comes in.

Obviously fancied himself. Starts looking at me. Right fucking at

me. Trying to put off, like, just for kicks. Looking at me as if

to say, 'Come ahead, square go.' Well, you know me, I'm no looking

for trouble but at the end of the day I'm the cunt with the pool

cue and I'm game for a swedge. So I squared up, casual like. So

what does the hard cunt do, or so-called hard cunt? Shites it.

Puts down his drink, turns around and gets the fuck out of there.

And after that, the game was mine.

RENTON

(v.o)

And that was it. That was Begbie's story. Or at least that was

Begbie's version of the story. But a couple of days later I got

the truth from Tommy. It was one of his major weaknesses: he never

told lies, never took drugs, and never cheated on anyone.

TOMMY

Well, sure it was Wednesday morning, we were in the Volley playing

pool, that much is true.

TOMMY

(v.o)

But Begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash. He's got a hangover

so bad he can hardly hold the fucking cue, never mind pot the

ball. I'm doing my best to lose, trying to humour him, like, but

it's not doing any good: every time I touch the ball I pot

something, every time Begbie goes near the table he fucks it up.

So he's got the hump, right, but finally I manage to set it up so

all he's go to do is pot the black to win one game and salvage a

little pride and maybe not kick my head in, right. So he's on the

black, pressure shot, and it all goes wrong, big time. What does

he do? Picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuses him

of putting him off by looking at him. Can you believe it? I mean,

the poor cunt hasn't even glanced in our direction. He's sitting

there quiet as a mouse when Beggars gubs him with the cue. He was

going to chib him, I tell you, then I thought he was going to do

me. The Beggar is fucking psycho, but he's a mate, you know, so

what can you do?

RENTON

Can I borrow this one?

RENTON

(v.o)

Yeah, the guy's a psycho, but it's true, he's a mate as well, so

what can you do? Just stand back and watch and try not to get

involved. Begbie didn't do drugs either, he just did people. That

what he got off on: his own sensory addiction.

BEGBIE

All right. Nobody move. The girl got glassed and no cunt leaves

here until we find out which cunt did it.

MAN

And who the fuck do you think you are?

RENTON

(v.o)

And as I sat watching the intimate and highly personal video,

stolen only hours earlier from one of my best friends, I realized

that something important was missing from my life.

TOMMY

How's it going with Gail?

SPUD

No joy yet.

TOMMY

How long is it?

SPUD

Six weeks.

TOMMY

Six weeks!

SPUD

It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to

start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally

defined from then on in.

TOMMY

Where did she come up with that?

SPUD

She read it in Cosmopolitan.

TOMMY

Six weeks and no sex?

SPUD

I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.

GAIL

I read it in Cosmopolitan.

LIZZY

It's an interesting theory.

GAIL

Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but

watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with

Tommy.

LIZZY

What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell

you about my birthday?

GAIL

What happened?

LIZZY

He forgot. Useless motherfucker.

TOMMY

Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm

sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.

SPUD

That's fair enough.

TOMMY

Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the

same night.

SPUD

Went ballistic?

TOMMY

Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to

decide.'

SPUD

So what's it going to be?

TOMMY

Well, I've paid for the ticket.

GAIL AND LIZZY

What are you two talking about?

TOMMY AND SPUID

Football. What were you talking about?

GAIL and LIZZY

Shopping

RENTON

(v.o)

The situation was becoming serious. Young Renton noticed the haste

with which the successful, in the sexual sphere as in all others,

egregated themselves from the failures.

RENTON

(v.o)

Heroin had robbed Renton of his sex drive, but now it returned

with a vengeance. And as the impotence of those days faded into

memory, grim desperation took hold in his sex-crazed mind. His

post-junk libido, fuelled by alcohol and amphetamine, taunted him

remorselessly with his own unsatisfied desire dot.

(v.o)

And with that, Mark Renton had fallen in love.

RENTON

Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by

the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that

situation. I thought to myself: she's special.

DIANE

Thanks.

RENTON

What's your name?

DIANE

Diane.

RENTON

Where are you going, Diane?

DIANE

I'm going home.

RENTON

Where's that?

DIANE

It's where I live.

RENTON

Great.

DIANE

What?

RENTON

I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.

DIANE

Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess,

you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach

girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive

type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know

the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a

little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just

love that?

RENTON

Eh-

DIANE

Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.

RENTON

I think I left something back at the -

TAXI DRIVER

Are you getting in or not, pal?

GAIL

Do you understand?

Our relationship is not being redefined; it is developing in an

appropriate, organic fashion. I expect you to be a considerate and

thoughtful lover, generous but firm. Failure on your part to live

up to these very reasonable expectations will result in swift

resumption of a non-sex situation. Right?

RENTON

Diane.

DIANE

Ssshh!

RENTON

Sorry.

DIANE

Shut up.

GAIL

Wake up, Spud, wake up. Sex.

Casual sex.

You useless bastards. So, let's see what I'm missing.

GAIL

Not much.

LIZZY

Tommy, let's put the tape on.

TOMMY

Now?

LIZZY

Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.

TOMMY

Fuck, OK.

RENTON

Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored

against Holland in 1978.

DIANE

Right. You can't sleep here.

RENTON

What?

DIANE

Out.

RENTON

Come on.

DIANE

No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go

home. It's up to you.

RENTON

Jesus.

DIANE

And don't make any noise.

LIZZY

What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?

TOMMY

It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.

LIZZY

Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video

store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video?

God, Tommy, I feel sick.

MAN

Good Morning.

WOMAN

Come in and sit down. You must be Mark.

RENTON

Yes, that's me.

WOMAN

You're a friend of Diane's?

RENTON

More of a friend of a friend, really.

MAN

Right.

RENTON

Are you her flatmates?

WOMAN

Flatmates. I must remember that one.

GAIL

Good morning, Spud.

SPUD

Morning, Gail. Morning, Mrs. Houston, Mr. Houston.

MOTHER

Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.

SPUD

Sorry about last night -

GAIL

It's all right. I slept fine on the sofa.

SPUD

I had a little too much to drink. I'm afraid I had a slight

accident.

FATHER

Oh, don't worry, these things happen. It does everyone good to cut

loose once in a while.

GAIL

This one could do with being tied up once in a while.

MOTHER

I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.

SPUD

No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.

MOTHER

There's no need.

SPUD

It's no problem.

MOTHER

No problem for me either.

MOTHER

Honestly, it's no problem.

SPUD

I'd really rather take care of it myself.

MOTHER

Spud, they're my sheets.

SPUD

DIANE

RENTON

Because it's illegal.

DIANE

Holding hands?

RENTON

No, not holding hands.

DIANE

In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more

last night.

RENTON

And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like

me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking

toilet.

DIANE

Calm down. You're not going to jail.

RENTON

Easy for you to say.

DIANE

Can I see you again?

RENTON

Certainly not.

DIANE

If you don't see me again I'll tell the police.

(to herself)

I'll see you around then.

SICK BOY

This had better be good.

TOMMY

It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who

don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped

doing smack.

SICK BOY

If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just

saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I

could be doing.

TOMMY

Such as?

SICK BOY

Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking,

smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?

SICK BOY

Now what?

TOMMY

We go for a walk.

SPUD

What?

TOMMY

A walk.

SPUD

But where?

TOMMY

There.

SICK BOY

Are you serious?

TOMMY

Well, what are you waiting for?

SPUD

I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.

TOMMY

It's the great outdoors.

SICK BOY

It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?

TOMMY

It's fresh air.

SICK BOY

Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but

there's no need to take it out on us.

TOMMY

Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?

RENTON

I hate being Scottish. We're the lowest of the fucking low, the

scum of the earth, the most wretched, servile, miserable, pathetic

trash that was ever shat into civilization. Some people hate the

English, but I don't. They're just wankers. We, on the other hand,

are colonized by wankers. We can't even pick a decent culture to

be colonized by. We are ruled by effete arseholes. It's a shite

state of affairs and all the fresh air in the world will not make

any fucking difference.

(v.o)

back on drugs as soon as possible. It took about twelve hours.

RENTON

(v.o)

It looks easy, this, but it's not. It looks like a doss, like a

soft option, but living like this, it's a full-time business.

SICK BOY

Ursula Andress was the quintessential Bond girl. That's what

everyone says. The embodiment of his superiority to us: beautiful,

exotic, highly sexual and yet unavailable to everyone but him.

Shite. Let's face it: if she'd shag one punter from Edinburgh,

she'd shag the fucking lot of us.

TOMMY

Lizzy's gone, Mark, she's gone and fucking dumped me. It was the

video tape and that Iggy Pop business and all sorts of other

stuff. She told me where to go and no mistake. I said, is there

any chance of getting back together, like, but no way, no fucking

way.

TOMMY

I want to try it, Mark. You're always going on about how it's the

ultimate hit and that. Better than sex. Come on, I'm a fucking

adult. I want to find out for myself.

SICK BOY

Honor Blackman a.k.a. Pussy Galore, what a total fucking misnomer.

I wouldn't touch her with yours. I'd sooner shag Col Kreb. At

least you know where you are with a woman like that. Not much to

look at, like, but personality, that's what counts, that's what

keeps a relationship going through the years. Like heroin. I mean,

heroin's got fucking great personality.

RENTON

(v.o)

Swanney taught us to adore and respect the National Health

Service, for it was the source of much of our gear. We stole

drugs, we stole prescriptions, or bought them, sold them, swapped

them, forged them, photocopied them or traded them with cancer

victims, alcoholics, old age pensioners, AIDS patients, epileptics

and bored housewives. We took morphine, diamorphine, cyclozine,

codeine, temazepam, nitrezepam, phenobarbitone, sodium amytal

dextropropoxyphene, methadone, nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine,

buprenorphine, dextromoramide chlormethiazole. The streets are

awash with drugs that you can have for unhappiness and pain, and

we took them all. Fuck it, we would have injected Vitamin C if

only they'd made it illegal.

BEGBIE

And remember, Rents: no skag.

RENTON

Aye, OK, Fr.

RENTON

(v.o)

But the good times couldn't last for ever.

RENTON

(v.o)

I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really

registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for

all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though

surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely

to fuck someone must have.

SICK BOY

What's wrong, Allison?

SPUD

RENTON

(v.o)

Nothing could have been further from the truth. In point of fact,

nothing at all was going to be just fine. On the contrary,

everything was going to be bad. Bad? I mean worse than it already

was.

SICK BOY

RENTON

(v.o)

It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine.

Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew.

Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something

sympathetic, something human.

SICK BOY

RENTON

ALLISON

Cook one for me, Renton. I need a hit.

RENTON

(v.o)

And so she did, I could understand that. To take the pain away. So

I cooked up and she got a hit, but only after me. That went

without saying.

RENTON

(v.o)

Well, at least we knew who the father was now. It wasn't just the

baby that died that day. Something inside Sick Boy was lost and

never returned. It seemed he had no theory with which to explain a

moment like this.

DIANE

Hello there, Mark.

What are you doing?

You didn't tell me you were a thief.

SPUD

Hey, go easy, lady. The boy's got a habit to support.

SICK BOY

Opium doesn't just grow on trees, you know.

RENTON

(v.o)

(v.o)

(v.o)

SHERIFF

...because shoplifting is theft, which is a crime, and, despite

what you may believe, there is no such entity as victimless crime.

Heroin addiction may explain your actions, but it does not excuse

them. Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of regret or

remorse. In sentencing you to six months' imprisonment my only

worry is that it will not be long before we meet again. Mr Renton,

I understand that you have entered into a programme of

rehabilation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin. The

suspension of your sentence is conditional upon your continued

cooperation with this programme. Should you stand guilty before me

again, I shall not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence.

RENTON

Thank you, your honour. With God's help, I'll conquer this

affliction.

(v.o)

What can you say? Well, Begbie had a phrase for it.

BEGBIE

It was fucking obvious that that cunt was going to fuck some cunt.

FATHER

I hope you've learned your lesson, son.

MOTHER

Oh, my son, I thought I was going to lose you there. You're

nothing but trouble to me, but I still love you.

BEGBIE

Clean up your act, sunshine. Cut that shite out for ever.

MOTHER

You listen to Francis, Mark, he's talking sense.

BEGBIE

SICK BOY

MOTHER

BEGBIE

But he pulled it off, clever bastard, and he got a result.

RENTON

BEGBIE

It's no our fault. Your boy went down because he was fucking

smack-head and if that's not your fault, I don't know what is.

Right. I'll get the drinks in.

RENTON

(v.o)

I wished I had gone down instead of Spud. Here I was surrounded by

my family and my so-called mates and I've never felt so alone,

never in all my puff. Since I was on remand they've had me on this

programme, the state-sponsored addiction, three sickly sweet doses

of methadone a day instead of smack. But it's never enough, and at

the moment it's nowhere near enough. I took all three this morning

and now I've got eighteen hours to go till my next shot and a

sweat on my back like a layer of frost. I need to visit the mother

superior for one hit, one fucking hit to get us over this long,

hard day.

RENTON

What's on the menu this evening?

SWANNEY

Your favourite dish.

RENTON

Excellent.

SWANNEY

Your usual table, sir?

RENTON

Why, thank you.

SWANNEY

And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?

RENTON

Stick it on my tab.

SWANNEY

Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and

breached a long time ago.

RENTON

In that case --

SWANNEY

Oh, hard currency, why, sir, that'll do nicely.

Can't be too careful when we're dealing with your type, can we?

Would sir care for a starter? Some garlic bread perhaps?

RENTON

No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection

of hard drugs, please.

SWANNEY

As you wish.

SWANNEY

Perhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi?

DOCTOR

Wake up. Wake up.

RENTON

(v.o)

I don't feel the sickness yet, but it's in the post, that's for

sure. I'm in the junky limbo at the moment, too ill to sleep, too

tired to stay awake, but the sickness is on its way. Sweat,

chills, nausea, pain and craving. Need like nothing else I have

ever known will soon take hold of me. It's on the way.

MOTHER

We'll help you, son. You'll stay with us until you get better.

We'll beat this together.

RENTON

Maybe I could go back to the clinic.

MOTHER

No. No clinics, no methadone. That made you worse, you said so

yourself. You lied to us, son, your own mother and father.

RENTON

At least get us some Tempazepam.

MOTHER

No, you're worse coming off that than you are with heroin. Nothing

at all.

FATHER

It's a clean break this time.

MOTHER

You're staying where we can keep an eye on you.

RENTON

I do appreciate what you're trying to do, I really do, but I need

just one score, to ease myself off it. Just one. Just one.

BEGBIE

Well, this is a good laugh, you fucking useless bastard. Go on,

sweat that shite out of your system, because if I come back and

it's still there, I'll fucking kick it out.

DIANE

'Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got red eyes, and I've

never met anyone quite like you before.'

SICK BOY

It's a mug's game, Mrs Renton. I'm not saying I was blameless

myself, far from it, but there comes a time when you have to turn

your back on that nonsense and just say no.

TOMMY

Better than sex, Rents, better than sex. The ultimate hit. I'm a

fucking adult. I'll find out for myself. Well, I've found out all

right.

FATHER

Mark, there's something you need to do.

DOCTOR

Come in. Sit down, please.

Well, you've already spoken to one of our counsellors, but before

we go on there're just a few questions I'd like to ask you.

DOCTOR

Question number one: the human immunodeficiency virus is a - what?

FATHER

Retrovirus?

DOCTOR

Retrovirus is the correct answer.

Question number two: HIV binds to which receptor on the host

lymphocyte? Which Receptor?

FATHER

CD4.

DOCTOR

CD4 receptor is the correct answer.

And now, question number three: is he guilty or not guilty?

MOTHER

He's our son.

DOCTOR

Is the correct answer.

And now it's time to 'Take the Test'.

MOTHER

RENTON

(v.o)

It seems, however, that I really am the luckiest guy in the world.

Several years of addiction right in the middle of an epidemic,

surrounded by the living dead, but not me -- I'm negative. It's

official. And once the pain goes away, that's when the real battle

starts. Depression. Boredom. You feel so fucking low, you'll want

to fucking top yourself.

RENTON

Are you getting out much?

TOMMY

No.

RENTON

Following the game at all?

TOMMY

No.

RENTON

No. Me Neither.

TOMMY

You take the test?

RENTON

Aye.

TOMMY

Clear?

RENTON

Aye.

TOMMY

That's nice.

RENTON

I'm sorry, Tommy.

TOMMY

Have you got any gear on you?

RENTON

No, I'm clean.

TOMMY

Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.

TOMMY

(continued)

Thanks, Mark.

RENTON

No problem.

(v.o)

No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite

for blood.

SWANNEY

Surprise! Pa-pah!

Hit the artery by mistake. Common enough error, or so the quack

tells us, as though that's going to make my leg grown back. Still,

it could have been worse, it could have been my fucking dick. And

I tell you what, in this place you get looked after: clean sheets,

regular meals and all the morphine you can eat.

RENTON

Great.

SWANNEY

And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get

myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women

really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a

king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your

pocket. No fucking problem.

RENTON

Sure.

SWANNEY

The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and

this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse

of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.

RENTON

Sounds great, Swanney.

SWANNEY

Yeah.

RENTON

You'll have to send us a postcard.

SWANNEY

SICK BOY

RENTON

SICK BOY

RENTON

SICK BOY

RENTON

SICK BOY

RENTON

SICK BOY

RENTON

And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and

the whole fucking stump fell off.

SICK BOY

Cut it out.

RENTON

When are you going to visit him?

SICK BOY

Don't know. Maybe Thursday.

RENTON

You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him

yet?

SICK BOY

Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The

gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up.

Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.

RENTON

You're all hear.

SICK BOY

I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what

they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the

punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not

exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it

here.' Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get

into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts,

get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?

RENTON

Fuck you.

SICK BOY

And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with

losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm

getting on with life. What are you doing?

RENTON

What do you want?

DIANE

Are you clean?

RENTON

Yes.

DIANE

Is that a promise, then?

RENTON

Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

DIANE

Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?

RENTON

No.

DIANE

I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.

RENTON

Well, it isn't.

DIANE

Smells like it.

RENTON

You're too young.

DIANE

Too young for what?

DIANE

You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music

is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all

day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.

RENTON

It's Iggy Pop.

DIANE

Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.

RENTON

Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.

DIANE

The point is, you've got to find something new.

RENTON

(v.o)

She was right. I had to find something new. There was only one

thing for it.

MAN

Can you take this call?

RENTON

Hello, yes, certainly. It's a beautifully converted Victorian town

house. Ideally located in a quiet road near to local shops and

transport.

RENTON

(v.o)

Two bedrooms and a kitchen/diner. Fully fitted in excellent

decorative order. Lots of storage space. All mod cons. Three

hundred and twenty pounds per week.

RENTON

(v.o)

I settled in not too badly and I kept myself to myself. Sometimes,

of course, I thought about the guys, but mainly I didn't miss them

at all. After all, this was boom town where any fool could make

cash from chaos and plenty did. I quite enjoyed the sound of it

all. Profit, loss, margins, takeovers, lending, letting,

subletting, subdividing, cheating, scamming, fragmenting, breaking

away. There was no such thing as society and even if there was, I

most certainly had nothing to do with it. For the first time in my

adult life I was almost content.

DIANE

(v.o)

Dear Mark, I'm glad you've found a job and somewhere to live.

School is fine at the moment. I'm not pregnant but thanks for

asking. Your friend Sick Boy asked me last week if I would like to

work for him but I told him where to go. I met Spud, who sends his

regards, or at least I think that's what he said. No one has seen

Tommy for ages. And finally, Fracis Begbie has been on television

a lot this week. --

DIANE

(v.o)

as he is wanted by the police in connection with an armed robbery

in a jeweller's in Corstorphine. Take care. Yours with love,

Diane.

RENTON

Oh no.

BEGBIE

Armed robbery? With a replica? How can it be armed robbery? It's a

fucking scandal.

And the haul. Look.

Solid silver, my arse. I took it to a fence -- it's trash, pure

trash. There's young couples investing all their hopes in that

stuff, and what are they getting?

RENTON

It's a scandal, Franco.

BEGBIE

Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm

fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.

RENTON

(v.o)

Begbie settled in in no time at all.

BEGBIE

(from the bedsit)

Rents, Rents, come fucking back here.

Look.

RENTON

What?

BEGBIE

I've no fucking cigarettes.

RENTON

Right.

RENTON

(v.o)

Yeah, the guy's a psycho, but it's true, he's a mate as well, so

what can you do?

BEGBIE

Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.

RENTON

Can you not go yourself.

BEGBIE

I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking

streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds

to win. Bad Boy.

RENTON

(v.o)

Bad Bot came in at 16 to 1. And with the winnings, we went out to

celebrate.

RENTON

(v.o)

Diane was right. The world is changing, music is changin, drugs

are changing, even men and women are changing. One thousand years

from now there'll be no guys and no girls, just wankers. Sounds

great to me. It's just a pity that no one told Begbie.

RENTON

(v.o)

You see, if you ask me, we're heterosexual by default, not be

decision. It's just a question of who you fancy.

RENTON

(v.o)

It's all about aesthetics and it's fuck all to do with morality.

RENTON

(v.o)

But you try telling Begbie that.

BEGBIE

I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.

RENTON

Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.

BEGBIE

Now, listen to me, you little piece of junky shit. A joke's a

fucking joke, but you mention that again and I'll cut you up.

Understand?

RENTON

(v.o)

Since I last saw him, Sick Boy had reinvented himself as a pimp

and a pusher and was here to mix business and pleasure, setting up

'contacts', as he constantly informed me, for the great skag deal

that was one day going to make him rich.

MAN

Beautifully converted Victorian town house. Ideally located in a

quiet road near to local shops and transport. Two bedrooms and a

kitchen/diner. Fully fitted in excellent decorative order. Lots of

storage space. All mod cons. Three hundred and twenty pounds a

week.

SICK BOY

Good chips.

RENTON

I can't believe you did that.

SICK BOY

I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.

RENTON

It was my fucking television.

SICK BOY

Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about

it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?

Have you got a passport?

RENTON

Why?

SICK BOY

Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts.

Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to

foreigners. Get you a good price.

RENTON

Why would I want to sell my passport?

SICK BOY

It was just an idea.

I had to get rid of them. Sick Boy didn't do his drug deal and he

didn't get rich. Instead, he and Begbie just hung around my bedsit

looking for things to steal. I decided to put them in the worst

place in the world.

RENTON

(v.o)

But, of course, they weren't paying any rent, so when my boss

found two desperate suckers who would, Sick Boy and Begbie were

bound to feel threatened.

MAN

As you can see, it's a beautiful conversion. Two bedrooms,

kitchen/diner. Fully fitted. Lots of storage. All mod cons. Three

hundred and twenty quid a week.

RENTON

(v.o)

And that was that. But by then we had another reason to go back.

Tommy.

GAV

(v.o)

Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gon

full-blown.

RENTON

(v.o)

What was it, pneumonia or cancer?

GAV

(v.o)

No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.

RENTON

(v.o)

Eh? How's that?

GAV

He wanted to see Lizzy again.

RENTON

I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.

GAV

Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So

there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what

happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over

the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on

smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from

cat shit.

RENTON

I didn't either. What the fuck is it?

GAV

(v.o)

He starts getting headaches, so he just uses more smack, for the

pain, like. There he has a stroke. A fucking stroke. Just like

that. God home from hospital and died about three weeks later.

Been dead for ages before the neighbours complained about the

smell and the police broke the door down. Tommy was lying face

down in a pool of vomit.

GAV

The kitten was fine.

SPUD

Every time I think of Tommy I think of Australian, because every

time I went round he was just lying there, junked out of his mind,

watching Aussie soaps. Until he sold the telly, of course, then he

was just lying there. Buy every time I think of him, I still think

of Australia.

RENTON

Tommy.

SICK BOY

Did you tell him?

BEGBIE

No. On you go.

RENTON

What?

SICK BOY

There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy.

He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.

RENTON

How much?

SICK BOY

About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the

docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking

carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up

the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking

nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney

to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his

leg. ----------}

RENTON

So?

SICK BOY

So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very

reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a

guy I know in London.

RENTON

So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me

about a skag deal?

BEGBIE

Yeah.

RENTON

What was your price?

SICK BOY

Four Grand.

RENTON

But you don't have the money?

SICK BOY

We're two thousand short.

RENTON

That's tough.

SICK BOY

Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in

London.

RENTON

Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds.

BEGBIE

Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.

RENTON

Jesus.

BEGBIE

Two thousand, one hundred and thirty-three pounds.

RENTON

Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors?

Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been

to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to

go back again?

SPUD

I want the money, Mark, that's all.

BEGBIE

If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to

jail.

RENTON

It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to

this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's

happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.

DIANE

Unless you get caught.

RENTON

So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting

caught.

DIANE

So why have you told me about it?

RENTON

Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I

thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.

DIANE

I've got a boyfriend, Mark.

RENTON

What? Steady like?

DIANE

That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.

RENTON

And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?

DIANE

Sixteen next month.

RENTON

Happy birthday.

DIANE

What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?

RENTON

So, what's he like?

DIANE

Well, he's young and he's healthy.

And you're such a deadbeat, Mark.

RENTON

(v.o)

I hadn't told anyone everything that was running through my mind

about what might happen in London. There were a lot of

possibilities I didn't want to talk to anyone about. Ideas best

kept to myself. What no one told me was that when we bought the

skag, some lucky punter would have to try it out. Begbie didn't

trust Spud and Sick Boy was too careful these days, so I rolled up

my sleeve and did what had to be done.

RENTON

RENTON

(v.o)

Yes, that hit was good. I promised myself another one before I got

to London -- just for old time's sake, just to piss Begbie off.

RENTON

(v.o)

This was to be my final hit. But let's be clear about this:

there's final hits and final hits. What kind was this to be?

{----------Some final hits are actually terminal one way or

another, while others are merely transit points as you travel from

station to station on the junky journey through junky life.

----------}

RENTON

(v.o)

This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie

scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and

unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind:

any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or

another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top

of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to

twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it

off twenty years in Saughton.

BEGBIE

Did you bring the cards?

SICK BOY

What?

BEGBIE

The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.

SICK BOY

Well, I've not brought them.

BEGBIE

It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.

SICK BOY

Well, I've not brought them.

BEGBIE

It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.

SICK BOY

I'm sorry.

BEGBIE

Bit fucking late, like.

SICK BOY

Well, why didn't you bring them?

BEGBIE

Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.

SICK BOY

Christ.

ANDREAS

These are your friends?

SICK BOY

These are the guys I told you about.

ANDREAS

OK.

SICK BOY

Is he here?

ANDREAS

Yes, he's here. I hope you didn't get followed or nothing.

BEGBIE

We didn't get followed.

RENTON

(v.o)

Straight away he clocked us from what we were: small-time wasters

with an accidental big deal.

MAN

So what do you want for it?

BEGBIE

Twenty thousand.

MAN

But it's not worth more than fifteen.

BEGBIE

Ninteen.

MAN

Nineteen I can't offer you, I'm sorry.

RENTON

(v.o)

This was a real drag to him. He didn't need to negotiate. I mean,

what the fuck were we going to do if he didn't buy it? Sell it on

the streets. Fuck that.

(v.o)

We settled on sixteen thousand pounds. He had a lot more in the

suitcase, but it was better than nothing. And just for a moment it

felt really great, like we were all in it together, like friends,

like it meant something. A moment like that, it can touch you deep

inside, but it doesn't last long, not like sixteen thousand

pounds.

SICK BOY

So what are you planning with your share, Spud?

RENTON

Buy yourself that island in the sun?

BEGBIE

For four fucking grand? One plam tree, a couple of rocks, and a

sewage outflow.

SPUD

I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy

some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out

like, and treat her -- properly.

BEGBIE

Shag her senseless.

SPUD

No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's

all --

BEGBIE

You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as

well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.

SICK BOY

I got a round already.

SPUD

I got the last one.

RENTON

It's your round Franco.

BEGBIE

OK. Same again?

SICK BOY

I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?

RENTON

The moment you turn your back, we're out that door.

SICK BOY

I'll be right after you.

BEGBIE

You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come

back --

RENTON

We'll be half-way down the road with the money.

BEGBIE

I'd fucking kill you.

RENTON

I guess you would, Franco.

Are you game for it?

Well?

SPUD

Are you serious?

RENTON

I don't know. What do you think?

SICK BOY

Still here, I see.

RENTON

Why not? I know I would. Where's Franco?

BEGBIE

For fuck's sake.

MAN

Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.

BEGBIE

All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.

MAN

Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

BEGBIE

Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.

RENTON

Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.

BEGBIE

Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.

MAN

Fuck you. If you can't hold a pint, you shouldn't be in the pub,

mate. Now fuck off.

SPUD

Jesus Christ.

SICK BOY

Good one, Franco.

BEGBIE

Shut you mouth or you'll be next.

SPUD

You've stabbed me, man.

BEGBIE

You were in my way.

And anyone in my way gets it, fucking gets it. Everybody hear

that? Everybody happy?

Hey, Rent-boy, bring us down a smoke.

SICK BOY

We'd better go, Franco.

SPUD

I've got to get to the hospital, man.

BEGBIE

You're not going to and fucking hospital.

You're staying there.

And you bring me a fucking cigarette.

And the bag.

RENTON

(v.o)

Now, I've justified this to myself in all sorts of ways: it wasn't

a big deal, just a minor betrayal, or we'd outgrown each other,

you know, that sort of thing, but let's face it, I ripped them

off. My so-called mayes. But Begbie, I couldn't give a shit about

him, and Sick Boy, well, he'd have done the same to me if only

he'd thought of it first, and Spud, well, OK, I felt sorry for

Spud -- he never hurt anybody.

RENTON

(v.o)

So why did I do it? I could offer a million answers, all false.

The truth is that I'm a bad person, but that's going to change,

I'm going to change. This is the last of this sort of thing. I'm

cleaning up and I'm moving on, going straight and choosing life.

I'm looking forward to it already. I'm going to be just like you:

the job, the family, the fucking big television, the washing
