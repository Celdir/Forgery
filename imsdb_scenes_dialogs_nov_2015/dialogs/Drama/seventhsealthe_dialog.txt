KNIGHT

Who are you?

DEATH

I am Death.

KNIGHT

Have you come for me?

DEATH

I have been walking by your side for a long

time.

KNIGHT

That I know.

DEATH

Are you prepared?

KNIGHT

My body is frightened, but I am not.

DEATH

Well, there is no shame in that.

KNIGHT

Wait a moment.

DEATH

That's what they all say. I grant no reprieves.

KNIGHT

You play chess, don't you?

DEATH

How did you know that?

KNIGHT

I have seen it in paintings and heard it sung

in ballads.

DEATH

Yes, in fact I'm quite a good chess player.

KNIGHT

But you can't be better than I am.

DEATH

Why do you want to play chess with me?

KNIGHT

I have my reasons.

DEATH

That is your privilege.

KNIGHT

The condition is that I may live as long as I

hold out against you. If I win, you will

release me. Is it agreed?

KNIGHT

You drew black!

DEATH

Very appropriate. Don't you think so?

JONS

(sings)

Between a strumpet's legs to lie

Is the life for which I sigh.

JONS

(sings)

Up above is God Almighty

So very far away,

But your brother the Devil

You will meet on every level.

JONS

In Frjestad everyone was talking about evil

omens and other horrible things. Two horses had

eaten each other in the night, and, in the

churchyard, graves had been opened and the

remains of corpses scattered all over the

place. Yesterday afternoon there were as many

as four suns in the heavens.

KNIGHT

Well, did he show you the way?

JONS

Not exactly.

KNIGHT

What did he say?

JONS

Nothing.

KNIGHT

Was he a mute?

JONS

No, sir, I wouldn't say that. As a matter of

fact, he was quite eloquent.

KNIGHT

Oh?

JONS

He was eloquent, all right. The trouble is that

what he had to say was most depressing.

(sings)

One moment you're bright and lively,

The next you're crawling with worms.

Fate is a terrible villain

And you, my friend, its poor victim.

KNIGHT

Must you sing?

JONS

No.

JOF

Good morning. Have you had breakfast? I can't

eat grass, worse luck. Can't you teach me how?

We're a little hard up. People aren't very

interested in juggling in this part of the

country.

JOF

Mia, wake up. Wake up! Mia, I've just seen

something. I've got to tell you about it!

MIA

(sits up, terrified)

What is it? What's happened?

JOF

Listen, I've had a vision. No, it wasn't a

vision. It was real, absolutely real.

MIA

Oh, so you've had a vision again!

JOF

But I did see her!

MIA

Whom did you see?

JOF

The Virgin Mary.

MIA

Did you really see her?

JOF

She was so close to me that I could have

touched her. She had a golden crown on her head

and wore a blue gown with flowers of gold. She

was barefoot and had small brown hands with

which she was holding the Child and teaching

Him to walk. And then she saw me watching her

and she smiled at me. My eyes filled with tears

and when I wiped them away, she had disappeared.

And everything became so still in the sky and

on the earth. Can you understand ...

MIA

What an imagination you have.

JOF

You don't believe me! But it was real, I tell

you, not the kind of reality you see every day,

but a different kind.

MIA

Perhaps it was the kind of reality you told us

about when you saw the Devil painting our wagon

wheels red, using his tail as a brush.

JOF

(embarrassed)

Why must you keep bringing that up?

MIA

And then you discovered that you had red paint

under your nails.

JOF

Well, perhaps that time I made it up.

(eagerly)

I did it just so that you would believe in my

other visions. The real ones. The ones that I

didn't make up.

MIA

(severely)

You have to keep your visions under control.

Otherwise people will think that you're a

half-wit, which you're not. At least not yet --

as far as I know. But, come to think of it, I'm

not so sure about that.

JOF

(angry)

I didn't ask to have visions. I can't help it

if voices speak to me, if the Holy Virgin

appears before me and angels and devils like my

company.

SKAT

(sits up)

Haven't I told you once and for all that I need

my morning's sleep! I have asked you politely,

pleaded with you, but nothing works. So now I'm

telling you to shut up!

MIA

If we would only get some rain. Everything is

burned to cinders. We won't have anything to

eat this winter.

JOF

(yawning)

We'll get by.

MIA

I want Mikael to have a better life than ours.

JOF

Mikael will grow up to be a great acrobat -- or

a juggler who can do the one impossible trick.

MIA

What's that?

JOF

To make one of the balls stand absolutely still

in the air.

MIA

But that's impossible.

JOF

Impossible for us -- but not for him.

MIA

You're dreaming again.

JOF

I've composed a song. I made it up during the

night when I couldn't sleep. Do you want to

hear it?

MIA

Sing it. I'm very curious.

JOF

I have to sit up first.

JOF

(sings)

On a lily branch a dove is perched

Against the summer sky,

She sings a wondrous song of Christ

And there's great joy on high.

JOF

Mia! Are you asleep?

MIA

It's a lovely song.

JOF

I haven't finished yet.

MIA

I heard it, but I think I'll sleep a little

longer. You can sing the rest to me afterwards.

JOF

All you do is sleep.

SKAT

Is this supposed to be a mask for an actor? If

the priests didn't pay us so well, I'd say no

thank you.

JOF

Are you going to play Death?

SKAT

Just think, scaring decent folk out of their

wits with this kind of nonsense.

JOF

When are we supposed to do this play?

SKAT

At the saints' feast in Elsinore. We're going

to perform right on the church steps, believe

it or not.

JOF

Wouldn't it be better to play something bawdy?

People like it better, and, besides, it's more

fun.

SKAT

Idiot. There's a rumor going around that

there's a terrible pestilence in the land, and

now the priests are prophesying sudden death

and all sorts of spiritual agonies.

JOF

And what part am I to play?

SKAT

You're such a damn fool, so you're going to be

the Soul of Man.

JOF

That's a bad part, of course.

SKAT

Who makes the decisions around here? Who is the

director of this company anyhow?

SKAT

Bear this in mind, you fool. Your life hangs by

a thread. Your time is short.

(in his usual voice)

Are the women going to like me in this getup?

Will I make a hit? No! I feel as if I were dead

already.

MIA

Jof!

JOF

What is it?

MIA

Sit still. Don't move.

JOF

What do you mean?

MIA

Don't say anything.

JOF

I'm as silent as a grave.

MIA

Shh! I love you.

JONS

What is this supposed to represent?

PAINTER

The Dance of Death.

JONS

And that one is Death?

PAINTER

Yes, he dances off with all of them.

JONS

Why do you paint such nonsense?

PAINTER

I thought it would serve to remind people that

they must die.

JONS

Well, it's not going to make them feel any

happier.

PAINTER

Why should one always make people happy? It

might not be a bad idea to scare them a little

once in a while.

JONS

Then they'll close their eyes and refuse to

look at your painting.

PAINTER

Oh, they'll look. A skull is almost more

interesting than a naked woman.

JONS

If you do scare them ...

PAINTER

They'll think.

JONS

And if they think ...

PAINTER

They'll become still more scared.

JONS

And then they'll run right into the arms of the

priests.

PAINTER

That's not my business.

JONS

You're only painting your Dance of Death.

PAINTER

I'm only painting things as they are. Everyone

else can do as he likes.

JONS

Just think how some people will curse you.

PAINTER

Maybe. But then I'll paint something amusing

for them to look at. I have to make a living

-- at least until the plague takes me.

JONS

The plague. That sounds horrible.

PAINTER

You should see the boils on a diseased man's

throat. You should see how his body shrivels up

so that his legs look like knotted strings --

like the man I've painted over there.

JONS

That looks terrible.

PAINTER

It certainly does. He tries to rip out the

boil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open

with his fingernails and his screams can be

heard everywhere. Does that scare you?

JONS

Scare? Me? You don't know me. What are the

horrors you've painted over there?

PAINTER

The remarkable thing is that the poor creatures

think the pestilence is the Lord's punishment.

Mobs of people who call themselves Slaves of

Sin are swarming over the country, flagellating

themselves and others, all for the glory of God.

JONS

Do they really whip themselves?

PAINTER

Yes, it's a terrible sight. I crawl into a

ditch and hide when they pass by.

JONS

Do you have any brandy? I've been drinking

water all day and it's made me as thirsty as a

camel in the desert.

PAINTER

I think I frightened you after all.

KNIGHT

I want to talk to you as openly as I can, but

my heart is empty.

KNIGHT

The emptiness is a mirror turned towards my

own face. I see myself in it, and I am filled

with fear and disgust.

KNIGHT

Through my indifference to my fellow men, I

have isolated myself from their company. Now I

live in a world of phantoms. I am imprisoned in

my dreams and fantasies.

DEATH

And yet you don't want to die.

KNIGHT

Yes, I do.

DEATH

What are you waiting for?

KNIGHT

I want knowledge.

DEATH

You want guarantees?

KNIGHT

Call it whatever you like. Is it so cruelly

inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why

should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken

promises and unseen miracles?

KNIGHT

How can we have faith in those who believe when

we can't have faith in ourselves? What is going

to happen to those of us who want to believe

but aren't able to? And what is to become of

those who neither want to nor are capable of

believing?

KNIGHT

Why can't I kill God within me? Why does He

live on in this painful and humiliating way

even though I curse Him and want to tear Him

out of my heart? Why, in spite of everything,

is He a baffling reality that I can't shake

off? Do you hear me?

DEATH

Yes, I hear you.

KNIGHT

I want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions,

but knowledge. I want God to stretch out His

hand towards me, reveal Himself and speak to

me.

DEATH

But He remains silent.

KNIGHT

I call out to Him in the dark but no one seems

to be there.

DEATH

Perhaps no one is there.

KNIGHT

Then life is an outrageous horror. No one can

live in the face of death, knowing that all is

nothingness.

DEATH

Most people never reflect about either death or

the futility of life.

KNIGHT

But one day they will have to stand at that

last moment of life and look towards the

darkness.

DEATH

When that day comes ...

KNIGHT

In our fear, we make an image, and that image

we call God.

DEATH

You are worrying ...

KNIGHT

Death visited me this morning. We are playing

chess together. This reprieve gives me the

chance to arrange an urgent matter.

DEATH

What matter is that?

KNIGHT

My life has been a futile pursuit, a wandering,

a great deal of talk without meaning. I feel no

bitterness or self-reproach because the lives

of most people are very much like this. But I

will use my reprieve for one meaningful deed.

DEATH

Is that why you are playing chess with Death?

KNIGHT

He is a clever opponent, but up to now I

haven't lost a single man.

DEATH

How will you outwit Death in your game?

KNIGHT

I use a combination of the bishop and the

knight which he hasn't yet discovered. In the

next move I'll shatter one of his flanks.

DEATH

I'll remember that.

KNIGHT

You've tricked and cheated me! But we'll meet

again, and I'll find a way.

DEATH

(invisible)

We'll meet at the inn, and there we'll continue

playing.

KNIGHT

This is my hand. I can move it, feel the blood

pulsing through it. The sun is still high in

the sky and I, Antonius Block, am playing

chess with Death.

JONS

Me and my master have been abroad and have just

come home. Do you understand, you little

pictor?

PAINTER

The Crusade.

JONS

(drunk)

Precisely. For ten years we sat in the Holy

Land and let snakes bite us, flies sting us,

wild animals eat us, heathens butcher us, the

wine poison us, the women give us lice, the

lice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the

Glory of God. Our crusade was such madness that

only a real idealist could have thought it up.

But what you said about the plague was

horrible.

PAINTER

It's worse than that.

JONS

Ah, me. No matter which way you turn, you have

your rump behind you. That's the truth.

PAINTER

The rump behind you, the rump behind you

there's a profound truth.

JONS

This is squire Jns. He grins at Death, mocks

the Lord, laughs at himself and leers at the

girls. His world is a Jnsworld, believable

only to himself, ridiculous to all including

himself, meaningless to Heaven and of no

interest to Hell.

JONS

That soup of yours has a hell of a stink. What

is it good for?

SOLDIER

She has had carnal intercourse with the Evil

One.

JONS

And now she's in the stocks.

SOLDIER

She will be burned tomorrow morning at the

parish boundary. But we have to keep the Devil

away from the rest of us.

JONS

(holding his nose)

And you do that with this stinking mess?

SOLDIER

It's the best remedy: blood mixed with the bile

of a big black dog. The Devil can't stand the

smell.

JONS

Neither can I.

KNIGHT

Have you seen the Devil?

MONK

You must not talk to her.

KNIGHT

Can that be so dangerous?

MONK

I don't know, but she is believed to have

caused the pestilence with which we are

affected.

KNIGHT

I understand.

RAVEL

Why do you look so surprised? I steal from the

dead. These days it's quite a lucrative

enterprise.

RAVEL

You're thinking of running to the village and

telling. That wouldn't serve any purpose. Each

of us has to save his own skin. It's as simple

as that.

GIRL

Don't touch me.

RAVAL

Don't try to scream. There's no one around to

hear you, neither God nor man.

JONS

I recognize you, although it's a long time

since we met. Your name is Raval, from the

theological college at Roskilde. You are Dr.

Mirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis.

JONS

Am I not right?

JONS

You were the one who, ten years ago, convinced

my master of the necessity to join a better-

class crusade to the Holy Land.

JONS

You look uncomfortable. Do you have a stomach-

ache?

JONS

When I see you, I suddenly understand the

meaning of these ten years, which previously

seemed to me such a waste. Our life was too

good and we were too satisfied with ourselves.

The Lord wanted to punish us for our

complacency. That is why He sent you to spew

out your holy venom and poison the knight.

RAVEL

I acted in good faith.

JONS

But now you know better, don't you? Because

now you have turned into a thief. A more

fitting and rewarding occupation for

scoundrels. Isn't that so?

JONS

By all means. I'm not bloodthirsty.

RAVEL

Don't beat me.

JONS

I don't have the heart to touch you, Doctor.

But remember this: the next time we meet, I'll

brand your face the way one does with thieves.

(he rises)

What I really came for is to get my waterskin

filled.

GIRL

We have a deep well with cool, fresh water.

Come, I'll show you.

JONS

Jns is my name. I am a pleasant and talkative

young man who has never had anything but kind

thoughts and has only done beautiful and noble

deeds. I'm kindest of all to young women. With

them, there is no limit to my kindness.

JONS

Goodbye, my girl. I could very well have raped

you, but between you and me, I'm tired of that

kind of love. It runs a little dry in the end.

JONS

Now that I think of it, I will need a

housekeeper. Can you prepare good food?

(the GIRL nods)

As far as I know, I'm still a married man, but

I have high hopes that my wife is dead by now.

That's why I need a housekeeper.

(the GIRL doesn't

answer but gets up)

The devil with it! Come along and don't stand

there staring. I've saved your life, so you owe

me a great deal.

SKAT

Noble ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for

your interest. Please remain standing for a

little longer, or sit on the ground, because

we are now going to perform a tragedia about

an unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and

the handsome lover -- that's me.

SKAT

Here is the husband. Here is the wife. If

you'll shut up over there, you'll see something

splendid. As I said, I play the lover and I

haven't entered yet. That's why I'm going to

hide behind the curtain for the time being.

(he wipes the sweat

from his forehead)

It's damned hot. I think we'll have a

thunderstorm.

JOF

Night and moonlight now prevail

Here sleeps my wife so frail ...

VOICE FROM THE PUBLIC

Does she snore?

JOF

May I point out that this is a tragedy, and in

tragedies one doesn't snore.

VOICE FROM THE PUBLIC

I think she should snore anyhow.

JOF

Night and moonlight now prevail.

There snores -- I mean sleeps -- my wife so frail.

Jealous I am, as never before,

I hide myself behind this door.

Faithful is she

To her lover -- not me.

He soon comes a-stealing

To awaken her lusty feeling.

I shall now kill him dead

For cuckolding me in my bed.

There he comes in the moonlight,

His white legs shining bright.

Quiet as a mouse, here I'll lie,

Tell him not that he's about to die.

MIA

Look, there he comes in the night

My lover, my heart's delight.

MONK

God has sentenced us to punishment. We shall

all perish in the black death. You, standing

there like gaping cattle, you who sit there in

your glutted complacency, do you know that this

may be your last hour? Death stands right

behind you. I can see how his crown gleams in

the sun. His scythe flashes as he raises it

above your heads. Which one of you shall he

strike first? You there, who stand staring like

a goat, will your mouth be twisted into the

last unfinished gasp before nightfall? And you,

woman, who bloom with life and self-

satisfaction, will you pale and become

extinguished before the morning dawns? You back

there, with your swollen nose and stupid grin,

do you have another year left to dirty the

earth with your refuse? Do you know, you

insensible fools, that you shall die today or

tomorrow, or the next day, because all of you

have been sentenced? Do you hear what I say? Do

you hear the word? You have been sentenced,

sentenced!

MONK

Lord have mercy on us in our humiliation! Don't

turn your face from us in loathing and

contempt, but be merciful to us for the sake of

your son, Jesus Christ.

JONS

This damned ranting about doom. Is that food

for the minds of modern people? Do they really

expect us to take them seriously?

JONS

Yes, now you grin at me, my lord. But allow me

to point out that I've either read, heard or

experienced most of the tales which we people

tell each other.

KNIGHT

(yawns)

Yes, yes.

JONS

Even the ghost stories about God the Father,

the angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost --

all these I've accepted without too much

emotion.

JONS

(contentedly)

My little stomach is my world, my head is my

eternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. My

legs are time's damned pendulums, and my dirty

feet are two splendid starting points for my

philosophy. Everything is worth precisely as

much as a belch, the only difference being that

a belch is more satisfying.

JONS

What are you screaming about?

PLOG

I am Plog, the smith, and you are the squire

Jns.

JONS

That's possible.

PLOG

Have you seen my wife?

JONS

No, I haven't. But if I had seen her and she

looked like you, I'd quickly forget that I'd

seen her.

PLOG

Well, in that case you haven't seen her.

JONS

Maybe she's run off.

PLOG

Do you know anything?

JONS

I know quite a lot, but not about your wife. Go

to the inn. Maybe they can help you.

MERCHANT

Yes, it's true! The plague is spreading along

the west coast. People are dying like flies.

Usually business would be good at this time of

year, but, damn it, I've still got my whole

stock unsold.

WOMAN

They speak of the judgment day. And all these

omens are terrible. Worms, chopped-off hands

and other monstrosities began pouring out of

an old woman, and down in the village another

woman gave birth to a calf's head.

OLD MAN

The day of judgment. Imagine.

FARMER

It hasn't rained here for a month. We'll surely

lose our crops.

MERCHANT

And people are acting crazy, I'd say. They flee

the country and carry the plague with them

wherever they go.

OLD MAN

The day of judgment. Just think, just think!

FARMER

If it's as they say, I suppose a person should

look after his house and try to enjoy life as

long as he can.

WOMAN

But there have been other things too, such

things that can't even be spoken of.

(whispers)

Things that mustn't be named -- but the priests

say that the woman carries it between her legs

and that's why she must cleanse herself.

OLD MAN

Judgment day. And the Riders of the Apocalypse

stand at the bend in the village road. I

imagine they'll come on judgment night, at

sundown.

WOMAN

There are many who have purged themselves with

fire and died from it, but the priests say that

it's better to die pure than to live for hell.

MERCHANT

This is the end, yes, it is. No one says it out

loud, but all of us know that it's the end. And

people are going mad from fear.

FARMER

So you're afraid too.

MERCHANT

Of course I'm afraid.

OLD MAN

The judgment day becomes night, and the angels

descend and the graves open. It will be

terrible to see.

RAVAL

Do you want this armlet? You can have it

cheap.

JOF

I can't afford it.

RAVAL

It's real silver.

JOF

It's nice. But it's surely too expensive for

me.

PLOG

Excuse me, but has anyone here seen my wife?

JOF

Has she disappeared?

PLOG

They say she's run away.

JOF

Has she deserted you?

PLOG

With an actor.

JOF

An actor! If she's got such bad taste, then I

think you should let her go.

PLOG

You're right. My first thought, of course, was

to kill her.

JOF

Oh. But to murder her, that's a terrible thing

to do.

PLOG

I'm also going to kill the actor.

JOF

The actor?

PLOG

Of course, the one she eloped with.

JOF

What has he done to deserve that?

PLOG

Are you stupid?

JOF

The actor! Now I understand. There are too many

of them, so even if he hasn't done anything in

particular you ought to kill him merely because

he's an actor.

PLOG

You see, my wife has always been interested in

the tricks of the theatre.

JOF

And that turned out to be her misfortune.

PLOG

Her misfortune, but not mine, because a person

who's born unfortunate can hardly suffer from

any further misfortune. Isn't that true?

RAVAL

Listen, you! You sit there and lie to the

smith.

JOF

I! A liar!

RAVAL

You're an actor too and it's probably your

partner who's run off with Plog's old lady.

PLOG

Are you an actor too?

JOF

An actor! Me! I wouldn't quite call myself that!

RAVAL

We ought to kill you; it's only logical.

JOF

(laughs)

You're really funny.

RAVAL

How strange -- you've turned pale. Have you

anything on your conscience?

JOF

You're funny. Don't you think he's funny?

(to Plog)

Oh, you don't.

RAVAL

Maybe we should mark you up a little with a

knife, like they do petty scoundrels of your

kind.

PLOG

(shouting)

What have you done with my wife?

JOF

Do you want to hurt me? Why? Have I provoked

someone, or got in the way? I'll leave right

now and never come back.

RAVAL

Get up so everyone can hear you. Talk louder.

RAVAL

Stand on your head so that we can see how good

an actor you are.

PLOG

(shouts)

What have you done with my wife?

RAVAL

Don't lie there moaning. Get up and dance.

JOF

I don't want to. I can't.

RAVEL

Show us how you imitate a bear.

JOF

I can't play a bear.

RAVAL

Let's see if you can't after all.

RAVEL

Up again! Be a good bear.

JOF

I haven't done any harm. I haven't got the

strength to play a bear any more.

JONS

Do you remember what I was going to do to you

if we met again?

JONS

I'm a man who keeps his word.

KNIGHT

What's his name?

MIA

Mikael.

KNIGHT

How old is he?

MIA

Oh, he'll soon be two.

KNIGHT

He's big for his age.

MIA

Do you think so? Yes, I guess he's rather big.

KNIGHT

You played some kind of show this afternoon.

MIA

Did you think it was bad?

KNIGHT

You are more beautiful now without your face

painted, and this gown is more becoming.

MIA

You see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us,

so we're in real trouble now.

KNIGHT

Is that your husband?

MIA

(laughs)

Jonas! The other man is my husband. His name is

Jof.

KNIGHT

Oh, that one.

MIA

And now there's only him and me. We'll have to

start doing tricks again and that's more

trouble than it's worth.

KNIGHT

Do you do tricks also?

MIA

We certainly do. And Jof is a very skillful

juggler.

KNIGHT

Is Mikael going to be an acrobat?

MIA

Jof wants him to be.

KNIGHT

But you don't.

MIA

I don't know.

(smiling)

Perhaps he'll become a knight.

KNIGHT

Let me assure you, that's no pleasure either.

MIA

No, you don't look so happy.

KNIGHT

No.

MIA

Are you tired?

KNIGHT

Yes.

MIA

Why?

KNIGHT

I have dull company.

MIA

Do you mean your squire?

KNIGHT

No, not him.

MIA

Who do you mean, then?

KNIGHT

Myself.

MIA

I understand.

KNIGHT

Do you, really?

MIA

Yes, I understand rather well. I have often

wondered why people torture themselves as often

as they can. Isn't that so?

JOF

Ouch, it hurts.

MIA

Why did you have to go there? And of course you

drank.

JOF

Ouch! I didn't drink anything.

MIA

Then I suppose you were boasting about the

angels and devils you consort with. People

don't like someone who has too many ideas and

fantasies.

JOF

I swear to you that I didn't say a word about

angels.

MIA

You were, of course, busy singing and dancing.

You can never stop being an actor. People also

become angry at that, and you know it.

JOF

Look what I bought for you.

MIA

You couldn't afford it.

JOF

(angry)

But I got it anyhow.

JOF

Oh, how they beat me.

MIA

Why didn't you beat them back?

JOF

I only become frightened and angry. I never get

a chance to hit back. I can get angry, you know

that. I roared like a lion.

MIA

Were they frightened?

JOF

No, they just laughed.

MIA

Do you notice how good he smells?

JOF

And he is so compact to hold. You're a sturdy

one. A real acrobat's body.

MIA

Yes, this is my husband, Jof.

JOF

Good evening.

KNIGHT

Good evening.

KNIGHT

I have just told your wife that you have a

splendid son. He'll bring great joy to you.

JOF

Yes, he's fine.

JOF

Have we nothing to offer the knight, Mia?

KNIGHT

Thank you, I don't want anything.

MIA

(housewifely)

I picked a basket of wild strawberries this

afternoon. And we have a drop of milk fresh

from a cow ...

JOF

... that we were allowed to milk. So, if you

would like to partake of this humble fare, it

would be a great honor.

MIA

Please be seated and I'll bring the food.

KNIGHT

Where are you going next?

JOF

Up to the saints' feast at Elsinore.

KNIGHT

I wouldn't advise you to go there.

JOF

Why not, if I may ask?

KNIGHT

The plague has spread in that direction,

following the coast line south. It's said that

people are dying by the tens of thousands.

JOF

Really! Well, sometimes life is a little hard.

KNIGHT

May I suggest ...

(JOF looks at him, surprised)

... that you follow me through the forest

tonight and stay at my home if you like. Or go

along the east coast. You'll probably be safer

there.

JOF

I wish you good appetite.

KNIGHT

I humbly thank you.

MIA

These are wild strawberries from the forest. I

have never seen such large ones. They grow up

there on the hillside. Notice how they smell!

JOF

Your suggestion is good, but I must think it

over.

MIA

It might be wise to have company going through

the forest. It's said to be full of trolls and

ghosts and bandits. That's what I've heard.

JOF

(staunchly)

Yes, I'd say that it's not a bad idea, but I

have to think about it. Now that Skat has left,

I am responsible for the troupe. After all, I

have become director of the whole company.

MIA

(mimics)

After all, I have become director of the whole

company.

MIA

Do you want some strawberries?

JOF

This man saved my life. Sit down, my friend,

and let us be together.

MIA

(stretches herself)

Oh, how nice this is.

KNIGHT

For a short while.

MIA

Nearly always. One day is like another. There

is nothing strange about that. The summer, of

course, is better than the winter, because in

summer you don't have to be cold. But spring is

best of all.

JOF

I have written a poem about the spring. Perhaps

you'd like to hear it. I'll run and get my lyre.

MIA

Not now, Jof. Our guests may not be amused by

your songs.

JONS

(politely)

By all means. I write little songs myself. For

example, I know a very funny song about a

wanton fish which I doubt that you've heard yet.

JONS

You'll not get to hear it either. There are

persons here who don't appreciate my art and I

don't want to upset anyone. I'm a sensitive

soul.

KNIGHT

People are troubled by so much.

MIA

It's always better when one is two. Have you no

one of your own?

KNIGHT

Yes, I think I had someone.

MIA

And what is she doing now?

KNIGHT

I don't know.

MIA

You look so solemn. Was she your beloved?

KNIGHT

We were newly married and we played together.

We laughed a great deal. I wrote songs to her

eyes, to her nose, to her beautiful little

ears. We went hunting together and at night we

danced. The house was full of life ...

MIA

Do you want some more strawberries?

KNIGHT

(shakes his head)

Faith is a torment, did you know that? It is

like loving someone who is out there in the

darkness but never appears, no matter how

loudly you call.

MIA

I don't understand what you mean.

KNIGHT

Everything I've said seems meaningless and

unreal while I sit here with you and your

husband. How unimportant it all becomes

suddenly.

MIA

Now you don't look so solemn.

KNIGHT

I shall remember this moment. The silence, the

twilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk,

your faces in the evening light. Mikael

sleeping, Jof with his lyre. I'll try to

remember what we have talked about. I'll carry

this memory between my hands as carefully as

if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh

milk.

KNIGHT

And it will be an adequate sign -- it will be

enough for me.

DEATH

I have been waiting for you.

KNIGHT

Pardon me. I was detained for a few moments.

Because I revealed my tactics to you, I'm in

retreat. It's your move.

DEATH

Why do you look so satisfied?

KNIGHT

That's my secret.

DEATH

Of course. Now I take your knight.

KNIGHT

You did the right thing.

DEATH

Have you tricked me?

KNIGHT

Of course. You fell right in the trap. Check!

DEATH

What are you laughing at?

KNIGHT

Don't worry about my laughter; save your king

instead.

DEATH

You're rather arrogant.

KNIGHT

Our game amuses me.

DEATH

It's your move. Hurry up. I'm a little pressed

for time.

KNIGHT

I understand that you've a lot to do, but you

can't get out of our game. It takes time.

DEATH

Are you going to escort the juggler and his

wife through the forest? Those whose names are

Jof and Mia and who have a small son?

KNIGHT

Why do you ask?

DEATH

Oh, no reason at all.

JONS

God in heaven, isn't this Plog, the smith?

PLOG

Good evening.

JONS

Are you sitting here sniveling in loneliness?

PLOG

Yes, yes, look at the smith. He moans like a

rabbit.

JONS

If I were in your boots, I'd be happy to get

rid of a wife in such an easy way.

PLOG

Are you married?

JONS

I! A hundred times and more. I can't keep count

of all my wives any longer. But it's often that

way when you're a traveling man.

PLOG

I can assure you that one wife is worse than a

hundred, or else I've had worse luck than any

poor wretch in this miserable world, which

isn't impossible.

JONS

Yes, it's hell with women and hell without

them. So, however you look at it, it's still

best to kill them off while it's most amusing.

PLOG

Women's nagging, the shrieking of children and

wet diapers, sharp nails and sharp words, blows

and pokes, and the devil's aunt for a

mother-in-law. And then, when one wants to

sleep after a long day, there's a new song --

tears, whining and moans loud enough to wake

the dead.

JONS

Why don't you kiss me good night?

PLOG

(in the same way)

Why don't you sing a song for me?

JONS

Why don't you love me the way you did when we

first met?

PLOG

Why don't you look at my new slip?

JONS

You only turn your back and snore.

PLOG

Oh hell!

JONS

Oh hell. And now she's gone. Rejoice!

PLOG

(furious)

I'll snip their noses with pliers, I'll bash in

their chests with a small hammer, I'll tap

their heads ever so lightly with a sledge.

JONS

Look how he howls again.

PLOG

Maybe I love her.

JONS

So, maybe you love her! Then, you poor

misguided ham shank, I'll tell you that love is

another word for lust, plus lust, plus lust

and a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and

all kinds of other fooling around.

PLOG

Yes, but it hurts anyway.

JONS

Of course. Love is the blackest of all plagues,

and if one could die of it, there would be

some pleasure in love. But you almost always

get over it.

PLOG

No, no, not me.

JONS

Yes, you too. There are only a couple of poor

wretches who die of love once in a while. Love

is as contagious as a cold in the nose. It eats

away at your strength, your independence, your

morale, if you have any. If everything is

imperfect in this imperfect world, love is most

perfect in its perfect imperfection.

PLOG

You're happy, you with your oily words, and,

besides, you believe your own drivel.

JONS

Believe! Who said that I believed it? But I

love to give good advice. If you ask me for

advice you'll get two pieces for the price of

one, because after all I really am an educated

man.

PLOG

Listen, Jns. May I go with you through the

forest? I'm so lonely and don't want to go home

because everyone will laugh at me.

JONS

Only if you don't whimper all the time, because

in that case we'll all have to avoid you.

JOF

Jns! Watch out. That one wants to fight all

the time. He's not quite sane.

JONS

Yes, but now he's just sniveling.

PLOG

I'm really sorry if I hurt you. But I have

such a hell of a temper, you know. Shake hands.

PLOG

Come in my arms, little brother.

JOF

Thank you, thank you, perhaps later. But now

we're really in a hurry.

PLOG

Now the moon has come out of the clouds.

JONS

That's good. Now we can see the road better.

MIA

I don't like the moon tonight.

JOF

The trees stand so still.

JONS

That's because there's no wind.

PLOG

I guess he means that they stand very still.

JOF

It's completely quiet.

JONS

If one could hear a fox at least.

JOF

Or an owl.

JONS

Or a human voice besides one's own.

GIRL

They say it's dangerous to remain standing in

moonlight.

JONS

Where are you going?

SOLDIER

To the place of execution.

JONS

Yes, now I can see. It's the girl who has done

it with the Black One. The witch?

KNIGHT

I see that they have hurt your hands.

KNIGHT

I have a potion that will stop your pain.

JONS

Why do you burn her at this time of night?

People have so few diversions these days.

SOLDIER

Saints preserve us, be quiet! It's said that

she brings the Devil with her wherever she

goes.

JONS

You are eight brave men, then.

SOLDIER

Well, we've been paid. And this is a volunteer

job.

KNIGHT

(to the WITCH)

What's your name?

TYAN

My name is Tyan, my lord.

KNIGHT

How old are you?

TYAN

Fourteen, my lord.

KNIGHT

And is it true that you have been in league

with the Devil?

KNIGHT

They say that you have been in league with the

Devil.

TYAN

Why do you ask?

KNIGHT

Not out of curiosity, but for very personal

reasons. I too want to meet him.

TYAN

Why?

KNIGHT

I want to ask him about God. He, if anyone,

must know.

TYAN

You can see him anytime.

KNIGHT

How?

TYAN

You must do as I tell you.

TYAN

Look into my eyes.

TYAN

What do you see? Do you see him?

KNIGHT

I see fear in your eyes, an empty, numb fear.

But nothing else.

TYAN

No one, nothing, no one?

KNIGHT

(shakes his head)

No.

TYAN

Can't you see him behind your back?

KNIGHT

(looks around)

No, there is no one there.

TYAN

But he is with me everywhere. I only have to

stretch out my hand and I can feel his hand. He

is with me now too. The fire won't hurt me. He

will protect me from everything evil.

KNIGHT

Has he told you this?

TYAN

I know it.

KNIGHT

Has he said it?

TYAN

I know it, I know it. You must see him

somewhere, you must. The priests had no

difficulty seeing him, nor did the soldiers.

They are so afraid of him that they don't even

dare touch me.

KNIGHT

Why have you crushed her hands?

SOLDIER

(surly)

We didn't do it.

KNIGHT

Who did?

SOLDIER

Ask the monk.

KNIGHT

What have you done with the child?

DEATH

Don't you ever stop asking questions?

KNIGHT

No, I'll never stop.

JONS

For a moment I thought of killing the soldiers,

but it would do no good. She's nearly dead

already.

SOLDIER

I've told you to be careful. Don't go too close

to her.

KNIGHT

Take this and it will stop the pain.

JONS

What does she see? Can you tell me?

KNIGHT

(shakes his head)

She feels no more pain.

JONS

You don't answer my question. Who watches over

that child? Is it the angels, or God, or the

Devil, or only the emptiness? Emptiness, my

lord!

KNIGHT

This cannot be.

JONS

Look at her eyes, my lord. Her poor brain has

just made a discovery. Emptiness under the

moon.

KNIGHT

No.

JONS

We stand powerless, our arms hanging at our

sides, because we see what she sees, and our

terror and hers are the same.

(an outburst)

That poor little child. I can't stand it, I

can't stand it ...

PLOG

Oh, now it came over me again!

JONS

Don't scream. What came over you?

PLOG

My wife, damn it. She is so beautiful. She is

so beautiful that she can't be described

without the accompaniment of a lyre.

JONS

Now it starts again.

PLOG

Her smile is like brandy. Her eyes like

blackberries ...

JONS

(sighs)

Get up, you tear-drenched pig. We'll lose the

others.

PLOG

Yes, of course, of course. Her nose is like a

little pink potato; her behind is like a juicy

pear -- yes, the whole woman is like a

strawberry patch. I can see her in front of me,

with arms like wonderful cucumbers.

JONS

Saints almighty, stop! You're a very bad poet,

despite the fact that you're drunk. And your

vegetable garden bores me.

PLOG

Look there.

JONS

Do you see something?

PLOG

There, over there!

JONS

I don't see anything.

PLOG

Hang on to something, my friends. The hour is

near! Who is that at the edge of the forest if

not my own dearly beloved, with actor attached?

SKAT

(panting)

You miserable stubbleheaded bastard of seven

scurvy bitches, if I were in your lousy rags I

would be stricken with such eternal shame about

my breath, my voice, my arms and legs -- in

short, about my whole body -- that I would

immediately rid nature of my own embarrassing

self.

PLOG

(angry)

Watch out, you perfumed slob, that I don't fart

on you and immediately blow you down to the

actor's own red-hot hell, where you can sit and

recite monologues to each other until the dust

comes out of the Devil's ears.

LISA

Forgive me, dear little husband, I'll never do

it again. I am so sorry and you can't imagine

how terribly that man over there betrayed me.

PLOG

I'll kill him anyway.

LISA

Yes, do that, just kill him. He isn't even a

human being.

JONS

Hell, he's an actor.

LISA

He is only a false beard, false teeth, false

smiles, rehearsed lines, and he's as empty as a

jug. Just kill him.

SKAT

She's right. Just kill me. If you thought that

I was going to apologize for being what I am,

you are mistaken.

LISA

Look how sickening he is. How he makes a fool

of himself, how he puts on an act. Dear Plog,

kill him.

SKAT

My friends, you have only to push, and my

unreality will soon be transformed into a new,

solid reality. An absolutely tangible corpse.

LISA

Do something then. Kill him.

PLOG

(embarrassed)

He has to fight me, otherwise I can't kill him.

SKAT

Your life's thread now hangs by a very ragged

shred. Idiot, your day is short.

PLOG

You'll have to irritate me a little more to get

me as angry as before.

SKAT

I forgive all of you. Pray for me sometimes.

PLOG

Oh dear, dear, I didn't mean it that way! Look,

there's no life left in him. I was beginning to

like him, and in my opinion Lisa was much too

spiteful.

JOF

He's dead, totally, enormously dead. In fact,

I've never seen such a dead actor.

LISA

Come on, let's go. This is nothing to mourn

over. He has only himself to blame.

PLOG

And I have to be married to her.

JONS

We must go on.

SKAT

Now that was a good scene. I'm really a good

actor. After all, why shouldn't I be a little

pleased with myself? But where shall I go? I'll

wait until it becomes light and then I'll find

the easiest way out of the forest. I'll climb

up a tree for the time being so that no bears,

wolves or ghosts can get at me.

SKAT

(yawns)

Tomorrow I'll find Jof and Mia and then we'll

go to the saints' feast in Elsinore. We'll make

lots of money there.

(yawns)

Now, I'll sing a little song to myself:

(sings)

I am a little bird

Who sings whate'er he will,

And when I am in danger

I fling out a pissing trill

As in the carnal thrill.

(speaks)

It's boring to be alone in the forest tonight.

(sings)

The terrible night doesn't frighten me ...

SKAT

Workmen in the forest. Oh, well!

(sings)

The terrible night doesn't frighten me ...

(speaks)

Hey, what the devil ... it's my tree they're

cutting down.

SKAT

Hey, you! Do you hear me, you tricky bastard?

What are you doing with my tree?

SKAT

Can't you at least answer me? Politeness costs

so little. Who are you?

DEATH

I'm sawing down your tree because your time is

up.

SKAT

It won't do. I haven't got time.

DEATH

So you haven't got time.

SKAT

No, I have my performance.

DEATH

Then it's canceled because of death.

SKAT

My contract.

DEATH

Your contract is terminated.

SKAT

My children, my family.

DEATH

Shame on you, Skat!

SKAT

Yes, I'm ashamed.

SKAT

Isn't there any way to get off? Aren't there

any special rules for actors?

DEATH

No, not in this case.

SKAT

No loopholes, no exceptions?

SKAT

Perhaps you'll take a bribe.

SKAT

Help!

SKAT

Help! Help!

JONS

Soon dawn will come, but the heat continues to

hang over us like a smothering blanket.

LISA

I'm so frightened.

PLOG

We feel that something is going to happen to

us, but we don't know what.

JONS

Maybe it's the day of judgment.

PLOG

The day of judgment ...

RAVAL

Do you have some water?

RAVAL

Can't you give me a little water?

(pause)

I have the plague.

JONS

Don't come here. If you do I'll slit your

throat. Keep to the other side of the tree.

RAVEL

I'm afraid of death.

RAVEL

I don't want to die! I don't want to!

RAVAL

Can't you have pity on me? Help me! At least

talk to me.

RAVAL

I am going to die. I. I. I! What will happen to

me! Can no one console me? Haven't you any

compassion? Can't you see that I ...

RAVAL

(whispers)

Can't anyone ... only a little water.

JONS

It's no use. It's no use. I know that it's no

use. It's meaningless. It's totally

meaningless. I tell you that it's meaningless.

Can't you hear that I'm consoling you?

RAVEL

Help me, help me!

DEATH

Shall we play our game to the end?

KNIGHT

Your move!

DEATH

Now I take your queen.

KNIGHT

I didn't notice that.

JOF

Mia!

MIA

Yes, what is it?

JOF

I see something terrible. Something I almost

can't talk about.

MIA

What do you see?

JOF

The knight is sitting over there playing chess.

MIA

Yes, I can see that too and I don't think it's

so terrible.

JOF

But do you see who he's playing with?

MIA

He is alone. You mustn't frighten me this way.

JOF

No, no, he isn't alone.

MIA

Who is it, then?

JOF

Death. He is sitting there playing chess with

Death himself.

MIA

You mustn't say that.

JOF

We must try to escape.

MIA

One can't do that.

JOF

We must try. They are so occupied with their

game that if we move very quietly, they won't

notice us.

JOF

I have harnessed the horse. The wagon is

standing near the big tree. You go first and

I'll follow you with the packs. See that Mikael

doesn't wake up.

DEATH

It is your move, Antonius Block.

DEATH

Have you lost interest in our game?

KNIGHT

Lost interest? On the contrary.

DEATH

You seem anxious. Are you hiding anything?

KNIGHT

Nothing escapes you -- or does it?

DEATH

Nothing escapes me. No one escapes from me.

KNIGHT

It's true that I'm worried.

KNIGHT

I've forgotten how the pieces stood.

DEATH

(laughs contentedly)

But I have not forgotten. You can't get away

that easily.

DEATH

Now I see something interesting.

KNIGHT

What do you see?

DEATH

You are mated on the next move, Antonius Block.

KNIGHT

That's true.

DEATH

Did you enjoy your reprieve?

KNIGHT

Yes, I did.

DEATH

I'm happy to hear that. Now I'll be leaving you.

When we meet again, you and your companions'

time will be up.

KNIGHT

And you will divulge your secrets.

DEATH

I have no secrets.

KNIGHT

So you know nothing.

DEATH

I have nothing to tell.

MIA

What a strange light.

JOF

I guess it's the thunderstorm which comes with

dawn.

MIA

No, it's something else. Something terrible. Do

you hear the roar in the forest?

JOF

It's probably rain.

MIA

No, it isn't rain. He has seen us and he's

following us. He has overtaken us; he's coming

towards us.

JOF

Not yet, Mia. In any case, not yet.

MIA

I'm so afraid. I'm so afraid.

JOF

Get into the wagon, Mia. Crawl in quickly.

We'll lie down, Mia, with Mikael between us.

JOF

It is the Angel of Death that's passing over

us, Mia. It's the Angel of Death. The Angel of

Death, and he's very big.

MIA

Do you feel how cold it is? I'm freezing. I'm

terribly cold.

KARIN

I heard from people who came from the crusade

that you were on your way home. I've been

waiting for you here. All the others have fled

from the plague.

KARIN

Don't you recognize me any more?

KARIN

You also have changed.

KARIN

Now I can see that it's you. Somewhere in your

eyes, somewhere in your face, but hidden and

frightened, is that boy who went away so many

years ago.

KNIGHT

It's over now and I'm a little tired.

KARIN

I see that you're tired.

KNIGHT

Over there stand my friends.

KARIN

Ask them in. They will break the fast with us.

KARIN

"And when the Lamb broke the seventh seal,

there was silence in heaven for about the space

of half an hour. And I saw the seven angels

which stood before God; and to them were given

seven trumpets. And another ..."

KARIN

"The first angel sounded, and there followed

hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were

cast upon the earth; and the third part of the

trees was burnt up and all the green grass was

burnt up."

KARIN

"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a

great mountain burning with fire was cast into

the sea; and a third part of the sea became

blood ..."

KNIGHT

Was someone there?

JONS

No, my lord. I saw no one.

KARIN

"And the third angel sounded, and there fell a

great star from heaven, burning as it were a

torch, and it fell upon the third part of the

rivers and upon the fountains of waters; and

the name of the star is called Wormwood ..."

KNIGHT

Good morning, noble lord.

KARIN

I am Karin, the knight's wife, and welcome you

courteously to my house.

PLOG

I am a smith by profession and rather good at

my trade, if I say so myself. My wife Lisa --

curtsy for the great lord, Lisa. She's a little

difficult to handle once in a while and we had

a little spat, so to speak, but no worse than

most people.

KNIGHT

From our darkness, we call out to Thee, Lord.

Have mercy on us because we are small and

frightened and ignorant.

JONS

(bitterly)

In the darkness where You are supposed to be,

where all of us probably are.... In the

darkness You will find no one to listen to Your

cries or be touched by Your sufferings. Wash

Your tears and mirror Yourself in Your

indifference.

KNIGHT

God, You who are somewhere, who must be

somewhere, have mercy upon us.

JONS

I could have given you an herb to purge you of

your worries about eternity. Now it seems to be

too late. But in any case, feel the immense

triumph of this last minute when you can still

roll your eyes and move your toes.

KARIN

Quiet, quiet.

JONS

I shall be silent, but under protest.

GIRL

(on her knees)

It is the end.

JOF

I see them, Mia! I see them! Over there against

the dark, stormy sky. They are all there. The

smith and Lisa and the knight and Raval and

Jns and Skat. And Death, the severe master,

invites them to dance. He tells them to hold

each other's hands and then they must tread the

dance in a long row. And first goes the master

with his scythe and hourglass, but Skat dangles

at the end with his lyre. They dance away from

the dawn and it's a solemn dance towards the

dark lands, while the rain washes their faces

and cleans the salt of the tears from their

cheeks.

MIA

(smiling)

You with your visions and dreams.
