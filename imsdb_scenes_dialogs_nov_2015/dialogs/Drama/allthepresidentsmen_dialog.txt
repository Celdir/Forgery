"ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN"

by

William Goldman

Based on the novel

"All The President's Men"

by

Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward

Pre-rehearsal version March, 1975

GO TO:

WOODWARD

No, no trouble, Harry, be right down.

(he hangs up)

Son of a bitch.

CUT TO:

ROSENFELD

Where's that cheery face we've come

to know and love?

WOODWARD

You call me in on my day off because

some idiots have broken into local

Democratic Headquarters--tell me,

Harry, why should I be smiling?

ROSENFELD

As usual, that keen mind of yours

has pegged the situation perfectly.

(chomps on some Maalox

tablets)

Except (a) it wasn't local Democratic

Headquarters, it was National

Democratic Headquarters--

(WOODWARD is surprised--

he hadn't known)

--and (b) these weren't just any

idiots, these were special idiots,

seeing as when they were arrested at

2:30 this morning, they were all

wearing business suits and Playtex

gloves and were carrying--

(consults a piece of

paper)

--a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of

film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized

tear gas guns, plus various bugging

devices.

(puts paper down)

Not to mention over two thousand

dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred

dollar bills.

WOODWARD

Preliminary hearing at Superior

Courthouse?

ROSENFELD

(nods)

Two o'clock, work the phones 'til

you go.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

(to the COUNSEL'S

CLERK)

Could you give me the names of the

lawyers for the men arrested in the

Watergate.

CLERK

These two were appointed--

(indicates the angry

men)

--only now it turns out the burglars

got their own counsel.

(he starts to laugh)

FIRST ANGRY LAWYER

(to CLERK)

When you gonna stop thinking it's so

funny.

SECOND ANGRY LAWYER

(To CLERK)

We wouldda done a terrific job

protecting those guys.

(neither lawyer, by

the way, is Clarence

Darrow)

FIRST ANGRY LAWYER

You think we're not as good as some

hotshot fancy lawyer?--

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward,

I'm from the Post and I wanted to

ask about how you happened to come

on this case--

CADDY

--I'm not here.

WOODWARD

(nods)

OK.

WOODWARD

Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record,

when questioned about his presence

in the courtroom, denied he was in

the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr.

Caddy said.

CADDY

(impatiently)

Clearly, I am here, but only as an

individual, I'm not the attorney of

record.

(indicating unshaven

man)

Mr. Rafferty has that position.

Whatever you want, you'll have to

get from him, I have nothing more to

say.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

(moving in behind him)

Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four

Cuban-Americans and this other man,

James McCord.

CADDY

Look, I told you inside--

WOODWARD

--you have nothing more to say, I

understand that.

WOODWARD

What I don't understand is how you

got here.

CADDY

I assure you, there's nothing

mysterious involved.

WOODWARD

Probably you're right, but a little

while ago, I was talking to a couple

of lawyers who'd been assigned to

represent the burglars.

CADDY

So?

WOODWARD

Well, they never would have been

assigned if anyone had known the

burglars had arranged for their own

counsel. And that could only mean

the burglars didn't arrange for their

own counsel--they never even made a

phone call.

(looks at CADDY)

So if they didn't ask for you to be

here, how did you know to come?

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Did you know to come because one of

the other men involved in the break-

in called you?

CADDY

(turning)

There is no reason to assume other

people were involved.

WOODWARD

Your clients were arrested with a

walkie-talkie; they didn't need that

to talk among themselves.

CADDY

(turning back)

They are not my clients.

WOODWARD

You're a lawyer and you're here--

CADDY

--I met one of the defendants, Mr.

Barker, at a social occasion once--

(stops himself)

--I have nothing more to say.

WOODWARD

(leaning forward as

CADDY turns away

again)

A Miami social occasion?

(explaining)

Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were

from Miami.

CADDY

(sighing)

Barker's wife called me at three

this morning; her husband apparently

had told her to call if he hadn't

called her by then.

WOODWARD

It was really nice of you to come,

since you'd only met him once.

CADDY

Are you implying you don't believe

me?

WOODWARD

I have nothing more to say.

CADDY

You don't mind getting on people's

nerves, do you?

WOODWARD

Nope.

CUT TO:

JUDGE

Will you please state your

professions.

BARKER

Anti-Communists.

JUDGE

Anti-Communists?

(perplexed)

That, sir, is not your average

occupation.

JUDGE

Your name, please.

MCCORD

James McCord.

JUDGE

Will you step forward, sir.

(MCCORD obeys)

JUDGE

And what is your occupation, Mr.

McCord?

MCCORD

(softly)

Security consultant.

JUDGE

Where?

MCCORD

(softer)

Government. Recently retired.

JUDGE

Where in government?

MCCORD

(we can't really make

this out)

...Central... Intelligence...

Agency...

JUDGE

(he can't either)

Where?

MCCORD

(clearing his throat)

The C.I.A.

ZOOM TO:

WOODWARD

(stunned)

Holy shit.

CUT TO:

UNION POST EMPLOYEE

(reading half-aloud)

"Five men, one of whom said he is a

former employee..."

(stops reading, gives

a shrug)

Schmucks.

CUT TO:

FIRST VOICE (V.O.)

Hurry it, huh, Bachinski?

BACHINSKI

You said I could look at it--

COP

--I said look, not memorize--

BACHINSKI

--almost done, give it a rest, all

right...

(and he looks at an

address book, he

stops)

CUT TO:

COP (V.O.)

What'd you find?

BACHINSKI (V.O.)

Beats me. These notebooks belonged

to Cuban guys?

COP (V.O.)

S'right.

BACHINSKI (V.O.)

It's gotta mean either White House

or whore house, one or the other.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Bachinski?

(reaches for a notebook)

What?--hold it--

(gets it open, starts

to write)

--OK, go on, go on...

CUT TO:

ROSENFELD

...go on, go on...

WOODWARD

That's everything Bachinski had, I

think it's worth following up.

ROSENFELD

Don't know; who the hell's Howard

Hunt?

(crunches tablets)

It's probably nothing but check it

out. Just go easy, it could be crazy

Cubans.

SIMONS

Anything?

ROSENFELD

Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with

the break-in thing--absolute page

one stuff--

SIMONS

--in other words, you got nothing,

you're thumbsucking.

ROSENFELD

(shrugs)

Could develop.

SIMONS

Let me see what you get, but don't

jump--The New York Times thinks it's

crazy Cubans.

ROSENFELD

OK, get on this W.House guy and do a

better job then you did on McCord.

WOODWARD

I did all right on McCord.

ROSENFELD

Then how come the Associated Press

were the ones found out that Mr.

McCord is security coordinator for

the Committee to Re-elect the

President, otherwise known as CREEP?

WOODWARD

(getting it straight)

The head of security for the

reelection of a Republican President

got caught bugging the national

offices of the Democrats? What the

hell does that mean?

ROSENFELD

(hasn't the foggiest)

Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP,

says it means nothing.

(reads)

"...This man and the other people

involved were not operating on either

our behalf or with our consent. These

is no place in our campaign or in

the electoral process for this type

of activity, and we will not forget

it or condone it."

WOODWARD

(getting up)

You can't believe that.

ROSENFELD

As a rough rule of thumb, as far as

I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's

how much I trust John Mitchell...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ROSENFELD

What'd you get on W.House?

WOODWARD

(massaging his neck)

Lotsa hints--

ROSENFELD

(not happy)

I can't sell hints to Simons--

(stops, looks at piece

of yellow paper)

--you called everyone you know?

(WOODWARD makes a nod)

Call someone you don't know.

WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR (V.O.)

White House.

WOODWARD

(casually)

Howard Hunt, please.

WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR (V.O.)

Mr. Hunt does not answer.

WOODWARD

Thanks, anyway--

WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR (V.O.)

I'll bet he's in Mr. Colson's office.

Let me connect you.

SECRETARY (V.O.)

Charles Colson's wire.

WOODWARD

(a little more excited)

Howard Hunt, please.

SECRETARY (V.O.)

Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.

WOODWARD

Thanks, anyway.

SECRETARY (V.O.)

Have you tried Mullen and Company

Public Relations? He works at Mullen

and Company Public Relations as a

writer. The number is 555-1313. I'm

sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

WOODWARD

Listen, forget it.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Who's Charles Colson?

ROSENFELD

(stops dead)

I would liken your query to being in

Russia half a century ago and asking

someone, "I understand who Lenin is

and Trotsky I got too, but who's

this yokel Stalin?"

WOODWARD

Who's Colson, Harry?

ROSENFELD

The most powerful man in America is

President Nixon, probably you've

heard his name.

ROSENFELD

The second most powerful man is Robert

Haldeman. Just below him are a trio:

Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend,

and they protect the President from

everybody which is why they are

referred to as either The German

Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr.

Mitchell we've already discussed.

Mr. Colson is the President's special

counsel.

WOODWARD

(rising)

Thanks, Harry.

(looks at ROSENFELD)

Know anything about Colson?

ROSENFELD

Just that on his office wall there's

a cartoon with a caption reading,

"When you've got them by the balls,

their hearts and minds will follow."

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing

Post and...

(beat)

Mullen and Company Public Relations?

Could you tell me when you expect

Mr. Hunt?

(surprised)

He is?

HUNT (V.O.)

Howard Hunt here.

WOODWARD

Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--

HUNT (V.O.)

(impatient)

--yes, yes, what is it?

WOODWARD

I was just kind of wondering why

your name and phone number were in

the address books of two of the men

arrested at Watergate?

HUNT (V.O.)

(blind panic)

Good God!

WOODWARD

I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Bennett,

but we're doing some investigating

of one of your employees, Howard

Hunt.

BENNETT (V.O.)

Well, if you've been doing some

investigating then obviously it's no

secret to you that Howard was with

the C.I.A.

WOODWARD

(he hadn't known)

No secret at all.

WOODWARD

(tired, voice deeper)

Hello, C.I.A. This is R.W. Woodward,

of the Washington Post--get me

Personnel--

WOODWARD

Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington

Post--and--what's that?--you've never

heard of me?--I can't help that--you

don't believe I'm with the Post?--

what do you want me to do, Madam,

shout "extra--extra"?

CUT TO:

ROSENFELD

Whaddya got, whaddya got?

WOODWARD

Hunt is Colson's man--

(to SIMONS, explaining)

--that's Charles Colson, Nixon's

special counsel--

(SIMONS almost says

something, decides

against it)

--they both went to Brown University--

(consulting his notes)

--Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till

'70, and this is on deep background,

the FBI thinks he's involved with

the break-in.

SIMONS

What else have you got?

WOODWARD

According to White House personnel,

Hunt definitely works there as a

consultant for Colson. But when I

called the White House Press office,

they said he hadn't worked there for

three months. Then the P.R. guy said

the weirdest thing to me.

(reading)

"I am convinced that neither Mr.

Colson nor anyone else at the White

House had any knowledge of, or

participation in, this deplorable

incident at the Democratic National

Committee."

SIMONS

Isn't that what you'd expect them to

say?

WOODWARD

Absolutely.

ROSENFELD

So?

WOODWARD

(he's got something

and he knows it)

I never asked them about Watergate.

I only said what were Hunt's duties

at the White House. They volunteered

that he was innocent when nobody

asked was he guilty.

ROSENFELD

(to SIMONS)

I think we got a White House

consultant linked to the bugging.

SIMONS

(nods)

Just be careful how you write it.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Here's the first take--

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

This is all of it, Harry.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

We have to talk.

PAN TO:

WOODWARD

What the hell were you doing rewriting

my story--

BERNSTEIN

--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--

WOODWARD

--it was fine the way it was--

BERNSTEIN

--it was bullshit the way it was--

WOODWARD

--I have to stand here and listen to

the staff correspondent from Virginia?--

BERNSTEIN

(a sore subject)

--what have you been here, nine

months?--I been in this business

since I was sixteen--

WOODWARD

--and you've had some fucking meteoric

rise, that's for sure--by the time

you turn forty you might be the head

of the Montana bureau--

BERNSTEIN

--you only got the job because both

you and Bradlee went to Yale--

WOODWARD

--Bradlee went to Harvard--

BERNSTEIN

--they're all the same, all those

Ivy League places--they teach you

about striped ties and suddenly you're

smart--

WOODWARD

--I'm smart enough to know my story

was solid--

BERNSTEIN

--mine's better--

WOODWARD

--no way--

BERNSTEIN

(handing them over)

--read 'em both and you'll see--

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

...crap...

BERNSTEIN

Is mine better?

WOODWARD

(handing the stories

back)

What is it about my writing that's

so rotten?

BERNSTEIN

(as he exits)

Mainly it has to do with your choice

of words.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD (V.O.)

(from behind the pillar)

Carl?

BERNSTEIN

(turns)

Yeah?

WOODWARD

(pushing his chair

briefly into view)

Fuck you, Carl.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

You heard?

(WOODWARD glances up)

They put us both on the break-in

thing. Simons liked the way we worked

together.

(WOODWARD nods,

BERNSTEIN sits down)

Listen, I'm sorry I said your story

was bullshit.

WOODWARD

It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a

failure.

BERNSTEIN

Forget it, the main thing--

(stops)

--did you call me a failure?

WOODWARD

I was sure trying.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

All right, what do we know?

BERNSTEIN

Let me lay a little theory on you--

WOODWARD

(cutting him off)

--I'm not interested in theory. What

do we know? For example, Hunt's

disappeared.

BERNSTEIN

Well, Barker tried to get blueprints

of the Miami Convention Center and

the air-conditioning system.

WOODWARD

And McCord was carrying an application

for college press credentials for

the Democratic convention.

(to BERNSTEIN)

The Times has got to be full of it--

it can't be crazy Cubans.

BERNSTEIN

What, though?

(points to Nixon)

It can't be the Republicans--he'd

never allow something as stupid as

this, not when he's gonna slaughter

McGovern anyway.

WOODWARD

Right. Nixon didn't get where he got

by being dumb--

(stops abruptly)

--listen, that was a Watergate

question--

CUT TO:

NIXON

The White House has had no involvement

whatever in this particular incident.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Hey?

BERNSTEIN

Hmm.

WOODWARD

What do you think he meant, this

particular incident? Were there

others? How would we find out? You

know anyone important?

BERNSTEIN

(sits, shakes his

head)

I lived here all my life, I got a

million contacts, but they're all

bus boys and bellhops.

RINGLE

What do you need?

BERNSTEIN

Someone inside the White House would

be nice.

RINGLE

(writes down phone

number)

Call her. She worked for Colson, if

that's any help.

CUT TO:

GIRL

Kenny's crazy, I never worked for

Colson, I worked for an assistant.

Colson was big on secrets anyway.

Even if I had worked for him, I

wouldn't have known anything.

BERNSTEIN

Nothing at all you can remember?

SECRETARY

(headshake)

Sorry.

(pause)

Now if it was Hunt you were interested

in--

BERNSTEIN

--Howard Hunt?

SECRETARY

Sure. Him I liked, he was a very

nice person. Secretive too, traveled

all over, but a decent man.

BERNSTEIN

Any idea what he did?

SECRETARY

Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was

he was investigating Kennedy--

BERNSTEIN

--Teddy Kennedy?

SECRETARY

Sure. I remember seeing a book about

Chappaquiddick on his desk and he

was always getting material out of

the White House Library and the

Library of Congress and--

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

White House Library, please.

OPERATOR (V.O.)

One moment.

LIBRARIAN (V.O.)

(elderly-sounding

lady)

Library.

BERNSTEIN

Hi. Carl Bernstein of the Washington

Post. I was just wondering if you

remember the names of any of the

books that Howard Hunt checked out

on Senator Kennedy.

LIBRARIAN (V.O.)

I think I do remember, he took out a

whole bunch of material. Let me just

go see.

BERNSTEIN

--what do you think?--

WOODWARD

--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary

consultant.

BERNSTEIN

Maybe a political operative of some

sort--

WOODWARD

--a spy, you mean?

BERNSTEIN

It makes sense; Hunt worked for the

C.I.A. and the White House was

paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.

LIBRARIAN (V.O.)

Mr. Bernstein?

BERNSTEIN

Yes, ma'am.

LIBRARIAN (V.O.)

What I said before? I was wrong. The

truth is, I don't have a card that

Mr. Hunt took out any Kennedy

material.

(WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN

listen, and now there

is something in her

voice that wasn't

there before: fear)

I remember getting that material out

for somebody, but it wasn't Mr. Hunt.

The truth is, I've never had any

requests at all from Mr. Hunt.

(beat)

The truth is, I don't know Mr. Hunt.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LIBRARIAN

You want all the material requested

by the White House?

LIBRARIAN

All White House transactions are

confidential.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

You think they are confidential? I

don't know anything about how this

town works, I haven't lived here a

year yet.

BERNSTEIN

We need a sympathetic face.

CUT TO:

YOUNG CLERK

You want every request since when?

BERNSTEIN

(to WOODWARD)

When did Hunt start at the White

House?

WOODWARD

July of '71.

BERNSTEIN

About the past year.

CLERK

(starts to smile)

I'm not sure you want 'em, but I got

'em.

CUT TO:

CLERK

I can't believe you guys are actually

doing this.

WOODWARD

(to the clerk)

You do a lot of things when you're

on a story.

(to BERNSTEIN, quietly)

Can you believe we're actually doing

this?

(BERNSTEIN can't)

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

That was fun.

(slams the door)

What now?

WOODWARD

I met a Presidential aide once at a

social occasion.

BERNSTEIN

(stunned)

And you haven't called him?--

CUT TO:

ROSENFELD

(to BERNSTEIN)

You got accurate notes on the White

House librarian?

(BERNSTEIN nods)

OK, we'll leave space for the White

House denial and we should be set.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ROSENFELD

Benjy, we got a present for you.

Above the fold on page one for sure.

It may not change our lives one way

or the other. Just a good, solid

piece of American Journalism--

(beat)

--that The New York Times doesn't

have.

CUT TO:

BRADLEE

You haven't got it.

(before they can reply)

A librarian and a secretary say Hunt

looked at a book.

(shakes his head)

Not good enough.

WOODWARD

I was told by this guy at the White

House that Hunt was investigating

Teddy Kennedy.

BRADLEE

How senior?

WOODWARD

(edgy)

You asking me to disclose my source?

BRADLEE

Just tell me his title.

WOODWARD

I don't know titles.

BRADLEE

Is he on the level of Assistant to

the President or not?

BRADLEE

Get some harder information next

time.

DEEP THROAT

I saw the flag signal--what's up?

WOODWARD

Nothing, that's the problem--the

story's gone underground.

DEEP THROAT

You thought I'd help out on specifics?

(headshake)

I'll confirm what you get, try to

keep you on the right track, but

that's all.

(looks at WOODWARD)

Are you guys really working?

(WOODWARD nods)

How much?

WOODWARD

I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen

hours a day--we've got sources at

Justice, the FBI, but it's still

drying up.

DEEP THROAT

Then there must be something, mustn't

there. Look, forget the myths the

media's created about the White House--

the truth is, these are not very

bright guys, and things got out of

hand.

WOODWARD

If you don't like them, why won't

you be more concrete with me?

DEEP THROAT

Because the press stinks too--history

on the run, that's all you're

interested in.

(inhales)

You come up with anything?

WOODWARD

John Mitchell resigned as head of

CREEP to spend more time with his

family. That doesn't exactly have

the ring of truth.

(DEEP THROAT nods)

Howard Hunt's been found--there was

talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand

in cash in a paper bag.

DEEP THROAT

Follow the money. Always follow the

money.

WOODWARD

To where?

DEEP THROAT

(shakes his head "no")

Go on.

WOODWARD

This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to

be tried along with Hunt and the

five burglars--we know he knows a

lot, we just don't know what.

DEEP THROAT

(lights a new cigarette)

You changed cabs? You're sure no one

followed you?

WOODWARD

I did everything you said, but it

all seemed--

DEEP THROAT

--melodramatic?

(headshakes)

Things are past that--remember, these

are men with switchblade mentalities

who run the world as if it were Dodge

City.

WOODWARD

What's the whole thing about--do you

know?

DEEP THROAT

What I know, you'll have to find out

on your own.

WOODWARD

Liddy--you think there's a chance

he'll talk?

DEEP THROAT

Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put

his hand over a candle. And he kept

it there. He kept it right in the

flame until his flesh seared. A woman

who was watching asked, "What's the

trick?" And he replied. "The trick

is not minding."

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

What's that?

WOODWARD

The fucking New York Times.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

Goddamnit--

WOODWARD

--see?--

BERNSTEIN

--I'm trying--

WOODWARD

--fifteen phone calls--

BERNSTEIN

---fifteen or more phone calls from

the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy

at CREEP--

WOODWARD

Why didn't we get that?

BERNSTEIN

Christ, and I even know somebody at

the phone company--

WOODWARD

--you do?--with access to records?

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

Why couldn't you have just dialed me

from the office, Irwin?

IRWIN

'Cause I'm not calling out from the

phone company anymore--

(drops his voice)

--I think the place is bugged.

BERNSTEIN

(taking some peanuts)

So tell me about the Times article.

IRWIN

What do you want to know?

BERNSTEIN

No games, Irwin; give.

IRWIN

(looks at BERNSTEIN)

My big civil rights buddy--

(shakes his head)

--boy, if John Mitchell was after

your phone records, would you be

screaming.

(eats)

What're you onto?

BERNSTEIN

Something maybe big.

IRWIN

And that makes anything you do OK,

is that it?

BERNSTEIN

Just tell me about the goddamn

article.

IRWIN

(shelling away)

It was accurate, but I can't get a

fuller listing for you--all Barker's

phone records have been subpoenaed.

BERNSTEIN

Who by?

IRWIN

A Miami D.A. The guy doing the

investigating is named Martin Dardis.

(finishes his peanuts,

starts off)

BERNSTEIN

Irwin? I really feel bad, doing

something like this--you know that,

don't you?

IRWIN

Don't give me any more of your liberal

shit, OK, Carl?

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

Harry, I just talked to a Miami

investigator about Barker--

ROSENFELD

--so?

BERNSTEIN

I think it might be helpful if you'd

send me to Miami.

ROSENFELD

I'm the one sent you to Toronto,

Bernstein--

BERNSTEIN

(trying to head him

off)

--that was awhile ago--

ROSENFELD

--"I think it might be helpful if

you'd send me to Toronto." That was

your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of

Deserters."

(whirls on BERNSTEIN)

I'm still waiting for it.

BERNSTEIN

Down to Miami and back--how much

damage can I do?

ROSENFELD

You're the fella who forgot he rented

a Hertz car, do I have to tell you

they didn't forget to send us the

bill?

CUT TO:

ROSENFELD

I can predict the next words you're

gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."

(SIMONS gestures for

ROSENFELD to continue)

I want to send a reporter to Miami.

SIMONS

Anyone but Bernstein.

ROSENFELD

Howard--

SIMONS

--remember Toronto, Harry.

ROSENFELD

That was awhile ago.

SIMONS

I don't get it--you were the one who

wanted to fire him.

ROSENFELD

I know, I did, but damnit Howard--

(SIMONS looks at him)

For the first time since I've known

him, I think he's really humping...

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

(answering)

Yeah?

(pause)

Yes, this is Carl Bernstein.

(stunned)

You're repossessing my bicycle?

(softer)

Listen, I'm sure I paid this month's

installment, so why don't you check

your records before you go around

hassling people?

(pause)

Oh...

BERNSTEIN

Hannah, I never would have bothered

you but I'm off to Miami and they're

gonna take away my ten speed unless

I get it straightened out fast.

HANNAH

(glancing around the

chaos)

Where are your bills, Carl?

BERNSTEIN

Oh, they're here.

(starts lifting debris

from his desk)

I'm keeping much better records now,

Hannah.

(grabbing a big manila

envelope)

See?

(hands it to her)

HANNAH

(looks inside)

Carl, it's a jungle.

(sits at his desk,

takes out a mass of

papers--glancing at

the top bill)

I suggest you either pay this

immediately or lay in a large supply

of candles.

(studies another bill)

You'd give a stranger the shirt off

your back--except it wouldn't be

paid for.

BERNSTEIN

Hey... very tense.

HANNAH

(nods)

Lot of pressure at the Star.

(looking at the bills)

Carl, when we got married, you were

four thousand dollars in debt; when

we split, you were solvent. That may

prove to be the outstanding single

achievement of my life, and now look

at this.

(sighs)

How much did the damn bike cost?

BERNSTEIN

Five hundred; six maybe.

HANNAH

(looking at paper)

You're two months behind--you got

enough to cover?

BERNSTEIN

I think.

HANNAH

Give me your checkbook then.

BERNSTEIN

It's right under that pile.

HANNAH

I thought you had to get to Miami.

BERNSTEIN

There's always a later plane.

HANNAH

You're a sex junkie, you know that,

Carl?

BERNSTEIN

Nobody's perfect.

(more rubbing now)

I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah--

you're a terrific reporter and I

turned you into a bookkeeper.

HANNAH

Aw baby, you can get it up... I just

wonder if you'll ever be able to get

it together.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

Hi, it's me. I'm still here.

SECRETARY

(couldn't be nicer)

I'm so glad.

BERNSTEIN

I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.

SECRETARY

And you will.

(smiles)

But not now.

BERNSTEIN

I called him from Washington. He's

the one who asked me to be here at

eleven in the morning.

SECRETARY

I told you, he had to go out on a

case.

CUT TO:

UNIFORMED COP

Is it OK to go on back?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car

radio?

SECRETARY

He is not in the car.

(Smiles; she's just

so understanding)

Sorry.

CUT TO:

SECOND COP

Hey, babe.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

Mr. Dardis does call in every so

often?

SECRETARY

Well of course.

BERNSTEIN

(quietly)

Good. Just tell him I was here, that

I'm sorry I missed him--

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

Mr. Dardis' office, please.

CUT TO:

SECRETARY

Mr. Dardis' office.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

This is Mr. Tomlinson in the clerk's

office. Could you come across the

hall for a moment? We've got some

documents your boss probably should

see.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VOICE (V.O.)

Dardis.

BERNSTEIN

Carl Bernstein's here to see you--I

don't know why, but he seems angry--

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

(to DARDIS)

Look, you've been jerking my chain

all day. If there's some reason you

can't talk to me--like the fact that

you've already leaked everything to

The New York Times--just say so.

DARDIS

Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we

do this tomorrow?

BERNSTEIN

(headshake)

I'm on deadline.

CUT TO:

DARDIS

You want Barker's phone stuff or his

money stuff?

BERNSTEIN

Whatever.

DARDIS

I'll never get out of here in time.

BERNSTEIN

(flying through what

he's been handed)

The telephone calls... we know about

that.

DARDIS

The rest is Barker's bank records.

It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand

in Mexican cashier's checks--

BERNSTEIN

--yeah, that was in The Times this

morning.

BERNSTEIN

(continuing stops)

What's this Dahlberg check?

CUT TO:

DARDIS' VOICE

That the twenty-five grand one?--

Don't know--

CUT TO:

DARDIS

I never could figure just who this

Dahlberg was.

(watching BERNSTEIN)

Think it might be anything?

BERNSTEIN

(casually)

This?

(shrugs)

Naw...

ZOOM TO:

BERNSTEIN

--Woodward--Woodward, listen, I don't

know what I got--

(holding the Dahlberg

facsimile)

--and I think the Times has it too--

(big)

--but somewhere there's a Kenneth H.

Dahlberg in this world and we've

gotta find him--

CUT TO:

RESEARCHER

Were you after the Dahlberg articles

from the files?

(WOODWARD nods)

There aren't any, sorry.

WOODWARD

Whazzis?

RESEARCHER

(shrugs)

Our Dahlberg file.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN'S VOICE (V.O.)

Harry--I know how to get Dahlberg--

ROSENFELD

--Woodward's talking to him know.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

--this should take only a minute,

Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow-

up on the break-in--

(pause)

--and I was kind of curious about

your check.

DAHLBERG (V.O.)

...check...?

WOODWARD

The twenty-five thousand dollar one.

(silence)

The one with your name on it.

(silence)

In Bernard Barker's Florida account.

(still nothing)

Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--

DAHLBERG (V.O.)

(struggling)

...you're definitely doing a story...?

WOODWARD

Yes, sir.

DAHLBERG (V.O.)

I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent

man, I don't do anything that isn't

decent or proper.

(WOODWARD waits, pen

ready; tense as hell)

I know I shouldn't tell you this...

DAHLBERG (V.O.)

That twenty-five thousand dollars is

money I collected for Nixon in this

year's campaign.

WOODWARD

I see. And how do you think it reached

Miami?

DAHLBERG (V.O.)

I don't know; I really don't. The

last time I saw it was when I was in

Washington. I gave it to the Finance

department of the Committee to Re-

Elect the President. How it got to

that burglar, your guess is as good

as mine.

WOODWARD

(trying to keep his

voice level)

That checks out with our finding,

thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.

CUT TO:

ROSENFELD

CREEP financed the Watergate break-

in, Jesus Christ.

WOODWARD

One sec'--

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SIMONS

--OK, last go-round. Foreign, anything

else?

SIMONS

(to another editor)

National?

NATIONAL EDITOR

I'll stand with the Eagleton follow-

ups and McGovern not being able to

get a replacement--that's your page

one stuff right there, Howard--

SIMONS

--Metropolitan?--

ROSENFELD

--you are ignoring the importance of

the Dahlberg repercussions--

NATIONAL EDITOR

--nobody gives a shit about the

Dahlberg repercussions--

ROSENFELD

(to NATIONAL EDITOR)

--quit equivocating, say what you

mean--

(to SIMONS and BRADLEE)

--our story got Government Accounting

to start an audit on CREEP's finances--

BRADLEE

--and we printed that, didn't we,

Harry? And when the frigging audit's

done, we'll print that too--

NATIONAL EDITOR

--let me tell what happened when I

was having lunch today at the Sans

Souci--

ROSENFELD

--correction--when you were drinking

your lunch at the bar of the Sans

Souci--

NATIONAL EDITOR

--this White House guy, a good one,

a pro, came up and asked what is

this Watergate compulsion with you

guys and I said, well, we think it's

important and he said, if it's so

goddamn important, who the hell are

Woodward and Bernstein?

ROSENFELD

Ask him what he's really saying--he

means take the story away from

Woodstein and give it to his people

at the National Desk--

NATIONAL EDITOR

--well, I've got some pretty

experienced fellas sitting around,

wouldn't you say so?--

ROSENFELD

--absolutely--and that's all they

do, sit sit sit--every once in a

while, they call up a Senator, some

reporting--

NATIONAL EDITOR

--well, what if your boys get it

wrong--

BRADLEE

(after a beat)

Then it's our asses, isn't it?

SIMONS

(indicates the meeting

is over)

And we'll all have to go to work for

a living.

FOREIGN EDITOR

I don't think either Metropolitan or

National should cover the story.

(BRADLEE and SIMONS

look at him)

I don't think we should cover the

story, period.

BRADLEE

Go on.

FOREIGN EDITOR

It's not that we're using unnamed

sources that bothers me, or that

everything we print the White House

denies, or that almost no other papers

are reprinting our stuff.

SIMONS

What then?

FOREIGN EDITOR

I don't believe the goddamn story,

Howard, it doesn't make sense.

BRADLEE

It will, it just hasn't bottomed out

yet, give it time.

FOREIGN EDITOR

Ben, Jesus, there are over two

thousand reporters in this town, are

there five on Watergate? Where did

we suddenly get all this wisdom?

FOREIGN EDITOR

Look--why would the Republicans do

it? --my God, McGovern is self-

destructing before our eyes--just

like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch

of 'em.

(sits on the table,

talks quietly on)

Why would the burglars have put the

tape around the door instead of up

and down unless they wanted to get

caught? Why did they take a walkie-

talkie and then turn it off, unless

they wanted to get caught? Why would

they use McCord--the only direct

contact to the Republicans?

BRADLEE

You saying the Democrats bugged

themselves?

FOREIGN EDITOR

The FBI thinks it's possible--the

Democrats need a campaign issue,

corruption's always a good one.

(rises, starts out)

Get off the story, Ben--or put some

people on McGovern's finances; fair

is fair, even in our business.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

UNION GUY

(to another UNION GUY

who's reading over

his shoulder)

What'd'ya think?

SECOND UNION GUY

Politics as usual, someone just got

caught with his hand in the cookie

jar, that's all.

UNION GUY

(he's not so sure)

Big fuckin' cookie jar.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

(sits across)

This is practically a high school

reunion for us, Jane--I would have

sprung for a classier place.

JANE

Anyplace really public, they'd know

about it--they know everything at

the Committee, Carl--

BERNSTEIN

--you don't really think you're being

followed?

JANE

This girlfriend of mine at the

Committee, the other day she went

back to the D.A. to tell the things

the FBI didn't ask her. That night,

her boss, he knew what she'd done.

They control everything; that's how

they know it all.

BERNSTEIN

FBI too?

JANE

You don't believe me? Well, I was

working the weekend of the break-in

and my God, all the executives were

running around like crazy--you had

to practically wait in line to use

the shredding machine--and when the

FBI came to investigate, they never

even asked me about it.

BERNSTEIN

If you don't like it down there, why

don't you quit?

JANE

I don't know what they'd do to me.

BERNSTEIN

(reaching over)

Hey, easy...

JANE

(headshake)

We're a long way from high school,

Carl...

(she looks at him)

...and I'm scared.

CUT TO:

JANE'S VOICE (O.S.)

They found out I saw you--

(BERNSTEIN stops,

glances around)

--they wanted to know everything.

(louder)

Don't call me again.

BERNSTEIN

(moving toward her

voice)

I can help if you'll--

JANE (O.S.)

--stay away from me, Carl!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CLERK

We have no one by the name of Mitchell

registered.

WOODWARD

My mistake, sorry.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Get me John Mitchell, it's urgent.

OPERATOR (V.O.)

That would be room 710, I'll connect

you.

MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

The Mitchells.

WOODWARD

Can I speak to Martha Mitchell,

please.

MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

Who is this?

WOODWARD

I've met Mrs. Mitchell in Washington,

I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and

tell her--

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FIRST MAID

We'll be back after lunch.

BLACK MAN

(it's the voice from

the phone)

We'll be here.

SECOND MAID

I think they went out.

WOODWARD

(shrugs)

I don't mind waiting.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

(as WOODWARD reaches

him)

See her?

(WOODWARD nods)

Get anything?

WOODWARD

For the paper, no; for us, plenty.

(The two of them head

for the terminal)

I waited a long time and finally

this big guy--I guess a bodyguard--

he left and I knocked and she

remembered me, we talked awhile.

BERNSTEIN

And?--And?--

WOODWARD

(looks at BERNSTEIN)

--she was panicked, Carl--every time

I mentioned Watergate, you could

tell.

BERNSTEIN

Were you eyebrow reading?

WOODWARD

(shakes his head "no")

It was there. I just don't get it; a

CREEP secretary being scared, that's

one thing. But what does the wife of

one of the most powerful men in

America have to be afraid of...?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

Left up ahead.

WOODWARD

Who's first?

BERNSTEIN

Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone

list, Miss Helen Abbott of South

George Street.

BERNSTEIN

Now hang your second right--

(explaining)

--this was my turf when I was a kid.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN (V.O.)

I brought you over one street too

many--go back and hang a left again.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

I don't get it... this really was my

turf...

WOODWARD

(concentrating on the

map)

You're not a kid anymore.

BERNSTEIN

(shaking his head)

My first day as a copy boy I was

sixteen and wearing my only grown-up

suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30

the head copy boy comes running up

to me and says, "My God, haven't you

washed the carbon paper yet? If it's

not washed by three, it'll never by

dry for tomorrow."

(WOODWARD is getting

interested in the

story now)

And I said, "Am I supposed to do

that?" and he said, "Absolutely,

it's crucial." So I run around and

grab all the carbon paper from all

the desks and take it to the men's

room. I'm standing there washing it

and it's splashing all over me and

the editor comes in to take a leak,

and he says, "What the fuck do you

think you're doing?" And I said,

"It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon

paper."

(BERNSTEIN looks at

WOODWARD)

Just wanted you to know I've done

dumber things than get us lost, that's

all.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington

Post and I hate to bother you at

home--

SWEET OLD LADY

--I already get the Post. I don't

need another subscription.

WOODWARD

No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk

to you about the Committee to Re-

Elect.

SWEET OLD LADY

The what to what?

WOODWARD

You work there, Miss Abbott.

SWEET OLD LADY

I'm not Miss Abbott.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Miss Abbott?

MISS ABBOTT

Yes?

WOODWARD

We're from the Washington Post and

we wanted to ask you some questions

about the Committee.

ZOOM TO:

MISS ABBOTT

I'm sorry--

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MIDDLE-AGED MAN

(literally trembling)

God, it's just so awful--

CUT TO:

A YOUNG GIRL

--I can't--I'd like to but--

(that's all she'll

say)

CUT TO:

OLD MAN

--go--you've got to go before they

see you--please--

CUT TO:

OLD WOMAN

--no... good...

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

You had the Mighty Mo and the fries

without gravy, right?

(WOODWARD shrugs)

WOODWARD

This is terrific work, if you like

rejection.

BERNSTEIN

I never scared anyone before.

WOODWARD

It's not us, they were scared before

we got there.

(looks at BERNSTEIN)

What do we know?

BERNSTEIN

Facts or theory?

WOODWARD

Anything you've got.

BERNSTEIN

We know there's got to be something

or they wouldn't be so panicked.

WOODWARD

And that something's got to be more

than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five

burglars--those indictments are gonna

be bullshit when they come down.

What else do we know?

BERNSTEIN

I just wish we knew when someone

would talk to us, that's all.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

A friend at the Committee told us to

contact you--

WOMAN

--who was it?

BERNSTEIN

We never reveal our sources, which

is why you can talk to us.

WOODWARD

It's safe, try it, you'll see.

BERNSTEIN

We understand your problem--

WOODWARD

--you believe in the President, you

wouldn't ever want to do anything

disloyal.

BERNSTEIN

We appreciate your position--really.

WOMAN

You people--you think that you can

come into someone's life, squeeze

what you want, then get out.

(to BERNSTEIN)

You don't appreciate a goddamn thing,

mister.

(to WOODWARD)

And you don't understand nothing.

(voice rising)

But the Committee's briefed us on

you--so get the hell out of here--

(big)

--do you like scaring the life out

of decent people?--'cause if you

don't, in the name of God--stop it!

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

At Yale once, they held an auction.

There was this woman and her name

was Lulu Landis. Her postcards came

up for sale. She had 1400 postcards

written to her and I'd never heard

of her before but I knew I had to

have those cards, I had to know why

anyone would get so many messages. I

paid sixty-five dollars for them...

I got all crazy trying to work it

out and first it was just a maze but

then I found that her husband killed

himself in Dayton, and once I had

that, it all began to open, an

evangelist had come to Dayton and

his horses hit Lulu Landis at the

corner of 13th and Vermillion and

she was paralyzed. Permanently, and

her favorite thing til then had been

traveling and all her friends,

whenever they went anyplace, they

wrote her. Those cards, they were

her eyes...

CUT TO:

MIDDLE-AGED MAN

I know who you are and I'm not afraid

but that don't mean I'll talk to you

either--you're just a couple Democrats

out to stop Nixon getting re-elected.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Democrats?

MIDDLE-AGED MAN

That's right.

BERNSTEIN

I hate both parties.

WOODWARD

And I'm a Republican.

BERNSTEIN

(surprised, turns to

WOODWARD)

Republican?

WOODWARD

Sure.

BERNSTEIN

Who'd you vote for?

WOODWARD

When?

BERNSTEIN

'68.

WOODWARD

Nixon.

CUT TO:

MIDDLE-AGED MAN

Mitchell never left the Committee--

he resigned, sure, but he was there

as much as before--

CUT TO:

YOUNGER MAN

--oh, don't worry, Gordon Liddy will

be happy to take the fall for everyone

because, well, it's not that Gordon's

crazy, he's...

(pauses, looking for

the right word)

...weird. I'll give you some Committee

people who know about him--only don't

tell it was me--

CUT TO:

YOUNGER WOMAN

--of course we were briefed on what

to say--and never to volunteer

anything--

CUT TO:

OLD WOMAN

--oh, we were never alone with the

FBI, there was always someone from

the Committee right there--

CUT TO:

NIXON

...No one in this administration,

presently employed, was involved in

this very bizarre incident...

CUT TO:

NIXON

...What really hurts in matters of

this sort is not the fact that they

occur, because overzealous people in

campaigns do things that are wrong.

What really hurts is if you try to

cover it up.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Did he just say what I think he said?

BERNSTEIN

You voted for him.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein of the

Washington Post and--

WOMAN

--oh, you don't want me, you want my

sister.

(calls out)

For you.

CUT TO:

BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER

This here is Carl Bernstein--

BOOKKEEPER

--omigod, you're from that place,

you've got to go.

BERNSTEIN

Could I bum one of your cigarettes?--

BERNSTEIN

--don't bother, I'll get it.

BOOKKEEPER

You've really got to go.

BERNSTEIN

Just let me get a match.

BERNSTEIN

But I want you to know that I

understand why you're afraid--a lot

of good people down there at the

Committee are afraid. I'm really

sorry for what you're being put

through.

BOOKKEEPER

All those articles you people write--

where do you find that stuff?

BERNSTEIN

We don't tell anyone that. Which is

why you can talk to us. And if we

can't verify what you say someplace

else, we don't print it. That's

another reason you can relax.

BOOKKEEPER

(tense)

I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.

BERNSTEIN

You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper

when he worked for Maurice Stans at

Finance, and we were sort of

wondering, did you go work for Stans

immediately after Sloan quit or was

there a time lapse?

BOOKKEEPER

I never worked for Sloan or Stans.

BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER

(out of the blue; to

BERNSTEIN)

Would you like some coffee or

anything?

BERNSTEIN

(like a shot)

Please, yes, thank you.

(he looks at the

BOOKKEEPER)

Can I sit down for a minute?

BOOKKEEPER

One minute but then--

BERNSTEIN

--right, right, I've got to go.

(he sits)

Why did you lie just then?

BERNSTEIN

I was just curious--you don't do it

well, so I wondered. Have you been

threatened, if you told the truth,

is that it?

BOOKKEEPER

...No... never in so many words...

BERNSTEIN

(gently)

It's obvious you want to talk to

someone--well, I'm someone.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

I'm not even going to put your name

down. It's just so I can keep things

straight.

(beat)

Start with the money, why don't you?

BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER

(returning with coffee)

How do you like it?

BERNSTEIN

Everything, please.

BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER

(going again)

I won't be a minute.

BERNSTEIN

(to the BOOKKEEPER,

quietly)

The General Accounting report said

there was a 350 thousand cash slush

fund in Stans' safe. Did you know

about that from the beginning?

BOOKKEEPER

(about to fold)

There are too many people watching

me--they know I know a lot--

BERNSTEIN

--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?

BOOKKEEPER

A lot of it was. I just thought it

was sort of an all-purpose political

fund--you know, for taking fat cats

to dinner, things like that.

BERNSTEIN

Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000

dollars.

BOOKKEEPER

(her words are coming

faster)

I can't be positive that it was used

for the break-in but people sure are

worried.

BERNSTEIN

Which people?

BOOKKEEPER

The ones who could disburse the money.

BERNSTEIN

Who were they?

BOOKKEEPER

There were a group of them--I think

five, I don't know their names.

BERNSTEIN

Sloan knew which five, didn't he?

(she nods)

BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER

(back with cream and

sugar)

Here we are.

BOOKKEEPER

I don't want to say anymore.

BERNSTEIN

(indicating coffee)

It's awfully hot--

(smiles)

--and you haven't finished telling

me about the money--

BOOKKEEPER

(long pause; then--in

a burst)

--omigod, there was so much of it,

six million came in one two-day period--

six million cash, we couldn't find

enough places to put it. I thought

it was all legal, I guess I did, til

after the break-in, when I remembered

Gordon got so much of it.

BERNSTEIN

(heart starting to

pound)

Gordon Liddy, you mean?

BOOKKEEPER

(nods)

It was all so crazy--the day after

the break-in he gave us a speech,

bouncing up and down on his heels in

that loony way of his--Gordon told

us not to let Jim McCord ruin

everything--don't let one bad apple

spoil the barrel, he said. You just

know that when Gordon Liddy's calling

someone a bad apple, something's

wrong somewhere.

(more and more moved

now)

...It's all so rotten... and getting

worse... and all I care about is

Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to

leave him if he didn't stand up and

do what was right. And he quit. He

quit because he saw it and didn't

want any part of it.

BERNSTEIN

Think Sloan's being set up as a fall

guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it

looks that way.

BOOKKEEPER

If you guys... if you guys could

just get John Mitchell... that would

be beautiful...

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

I  couldn't believe what she told

me. Eight cups of coffee worth.

WOODWARD

Go on, go on--

BERNSTEIN

--we've got to find out who the five

guys are--the five with access to

the slush fund--they were aware of

the break-in.

WOODWARD

Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments

will just be bullshit.

BERNSTEIN

It goes very high--we've got to find

out where--

WOODWARD

--we will--

BERNSTEIN

--she was really paranoid, the

bookkeeper.

WOODWARD

That happens to people.

(he goes over, turns

the hi-fi on even

louder. Shouts--)

OK, go on.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

How do you want to handle Sloan?

WOODWARD

You mean, who's going to play the

mean M.P. and who's going to be the

nice one?

(BERNSTEIN nods;

WOODWARD shrugs)

Whichever.

BERNSTEIN

He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll

probably expect you to be

understanding--might surprise him if

you're not.

WOODWARD

You want me to be the bastard.

BERNSTEIN

(nods)

And I'll just shitkick in my usual

way.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

To see Mr. Sloan.

MRS. SLOAN

He's out.

(There is a pause.

She studies them--)

You're those two from the Post, aren't

you.

(they nod)

I'll tell him.

BERNSTEIN

(as she's about to

step back inside)

This must be a difficult time for

the both of you.

MRS. SLOAN

This is an honest house.

WOODWARD

That's why we wanted to see your

husband.

MRS. SLOAN

That decision is up to him.

BERNSTEIN

(conspiratorially)

Maybe you could put in a good word.

WOODWARD

We've got another appointment tonight

in this area--we'll just stop back

later, all right?

MRS. SLOAN

It's a free country--

(beat)

--in theory.

MRS. SLOAN

(calling out)

Be careful--

CUT TO:

MRS. SLOAN

--you can destroy lives.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Think Sloan's back?

(BERNSTEIN seems lost

in thought)

What's wrong?

BERNSTEIN

Nothing--I just found out that Jeb

Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike

freak than I am.

(sips coffee)

I never like it when the other guy's

human...

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Mr. Sloan?

SLOAN

(nods)

My wife told me to expect you.

(softly)

As you know, I haven't talked to the

press.

BERNSTEIN

We were hoping that maybe now you

could. We know why you left the

Committee. We know you're not guilty

of anything. But we know you know

who is--

SLOAN

--look, come in. We'll have to be

quiet--my wife's asleep.

CUT TO:

SLOAN

I'd like to talk to you, I really

would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't

until after the Watergate trial.

WOODWARD

You handed out the money. Maybe

there's a legitimate explanation for

the way it was done--

BERNSTEIN

--then again, maybe things are even

worse than we've written--

SLOAN

--they're worse. That's why I quit.

SLOAN

Try and understand this. I'm a decent

Republican. I believe in Richard

Nixon. I worked in the White House

four years--so did my wife. What

happened on June 17 I don't think

the President knew anything about.

Some of his men I'm not so sure of.

BERNSTEIN

Do you think the truth will come out

at the trial?

SLOAN

That's another of the things I'm not

so sure of.

BERNSTEIN

Because people at the Committee were

told to lie to the prosecutors?

SLOAN

We were never told flat out "Don't

talk." But the message was clear.

BERNSTEIN

To cover up?

SLOAN

Well, they sure didn't ask us to

come forward and tell the truth.

WOODWARD

Does "they" mean the White House?

SLOAN

As opposed to the Committee? The

Committee's not an independent

operation. Everything is cleared

with the White House. I don't think

that the FBI or the prosecutors

understand that.

WOODWARD

The report on the cash in Maurice

Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty

thousand, that's true?

SLOAN

No. It was closer to seven hundred

thousand.

WOODWARD

And as treasurer, you could release

those funds?

SLOAN

(nods)

When so ordered.

WOODWARD

We're not sure we've got all the

guys who could order you, but we

know there were five.

(SLOAN is silent)

BERNSTEIN

(ticking them off)

Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, they're

obvious--

WOODWARD

--there had to be a White House

overseer--

BERNSTEIN

--Colson.

SLOAN

Colson's too smart to get directly

involved with something like that.

WOODWARD

(to BERNSTEIN)

Haldeman.

(to SLOAN)

Right?

SLOAN

I won't talk about the other two.

BERNSTEIN

But they both worked at the White

House?

SLOAN

(softly)

I will not talk about the other two.

BERNSTEIN

(out of the blue)

Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.

SLOAN

I can't say anything, I'm sorry.

(He starts to rise)

WOODWARD

One thing I'm not completely clear

on--when you gave out the money to

Liddy, how did that work?

SLOAN

Badly.

(and now for the first

time, he almost smiles)

You don't realize how close all this

came to staying undiscovered--I gave

Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave

it to Barker who took it to Miami

and deposited it.

BERNSTEIN

Right.

SLOAN

Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand

in hundred dollar bills and gave it

back to Liddy who gave it back to me

and I put it in the office safe which

was crammed.

WOODWARD

Go on.

SLOAN

Well, when Liddy came and asked for

money for what turned out to be the

break-in funds, I went to the safe

and gave him--out of this whole

fortune--I happened to give him the

same hundreds he gave me--banks have

to keep track of hundreds. If the

money had been in fifties, or if I'd

grabbed a different stack, there

probably wouldn't have been any

Watergate story.

BERNSTEIN

Ordinarily, though, what was the

procedure?

SLOAN

Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell

over at the Justice Department and

he'd say "go ahead, give out the

money."

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

What happens when the baby comes?

SLOAN

We're moving.

(beat)

I've been looking for a job but it's

been... hard. My name's been in the

papers too much. Sometimes I wonder

if reporters understand how much

pain they can inflict in just one

sentence. I'm not thinking of myself.

But my wife, my parents, it's been

very rough on them.

CUT TO:

SLOAN

I wish I could put down on paper

what it's like--you come to Washington

because you believe in something,

and then you get inside and you see

how things actually work and you

watch your ideals disintegrate.

(beat)

The people inside, the people in the

White House, they start to believe

they can suspend the rules because

they're fulfilling a mission. That

becomes the only important thing--

the mission. It's so easy to lose

perspective. We want to get out before

we lose ours altogether.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

Look--five men controlled that slush

fund as CREEP--three of them we've

got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and

we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.

WOODWARD

We'd like to wait til we have all

five before we print it.

BRADLEE

This is a daily paper, we'll explain

it tomorrow.

(looks at them)

You're certain on Mitchell?

WOODWARD

He approved the payments to Liddy

while he was still Attorney General--

ROSENFELD

--you got more than one source?--

BERNSTEIN

--yes--

SIMONS

--has any of them got an ax?--

ROSENFELD

--political, personal, sexual,

anything at all against Mitchell?--

WOODWARD

--no--

SIMONS

--can we use their names?--

BERNSTEIN

--no--

BRADLEE

--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna

go on the record on this story--

ROSENFELD

--who you got?--

WOODWARD

--well, Sloan--

BERNSTEIN

--and we got a guy in Justice--

BRADLEE

--Deep Throat?--

WOODWARD

--I saw him. He verifies.

BRADLEE

OK.

(now after the burst

of talk, a pause)

You're about to write a story that

says that the former Attorney General--

the man who represented law in America--

is a crook.

(throws the nerfball)

Just be right, huh?

BRADLEE

Leave plenty of room for his denial.

CUT TO:

OPERATOR'S VOICE (V.O.)

Essex House, can I help you?

BERNSTEIN

John Mitchell, please.

JOHN MITCHELL'S VOICE (V.O.)

Yes?

BERNSTEIN

Sir, this is Carl Bernstein of the

Washington Post, and I'm sorry to

bother you but we're running a story

in tomorrow's paper that we thought

you should have a chance to comment

on.

MITCHELL (V.O.)

What does it say?

BERNSTEIN

(starting to read)

John N. Mitchell, while serving as

US Attorney General, personally

controlled a secret cash fund that--

MITCHELL (V.O.)

--jeeeeeeesus--

BERNSTEIN

--fund that was used to gather

information against the Democrats--

MITCHELL (V.O.)

--jeeeeeeesus--

BERNSTEIN

--according to sources involved in

the Watergate investigation. Beginning

in the spring of 1971--

MITCHELL (V.O.)

--jeeeeeeesus--

BERNSTEIN

--almost a year before he left the

Justice Department--

MITCHELL (V.O.)

--jeeeeeeeeesus--

BERNSTEIN

--to become President Nixon's campaign

manager on March 1, Mitchell

personally approved withdrawals from

the fund--

MITCHELL (V.O.)

--all that crap, you're putting it

in the paper? It's all been denied.

You tell your publisher--tell Katie

Graham she's gonna get her tit caught

in a big fat wringer if that's

published. Good Christ! That's the

most sickening thing I ever heard.

BERNSTEIN

Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--

MITCHELL (V.O.)

--what time is it?

BERNSTEIN

11:30.

MITCHELL (V.O.)

Morning or night?

BERNSTEIN

Night.

MITCHELL (V.O.)

Oh.

CUT TO:

BRADLEE

He really made that remark about

Mrs. Graham?

(BERNSTEIN nods)

This is a family newspaper--cut the

words "her tit" and run it.

CUT TO:

BRADLEE

Once when I was reporting, Lyndon

Johnson's top guy gave me the word

they were looking for a successor to

J. Edgar Hoover. I wrote it and the

day it appeared Johnson called a

press conference and appointed Hoover

head of the FBI for life... And when

he was done, he turned to his top

guy and the President said, "Call

Ben Bradlee and tell him fuck you."

(shakes his head)

I took a lot of static for that--

everyone said, "You did it, Bradlee,

you screwed up--you stuck us with

Hoover forever--"

(looks at WOODWARD

and BERNSTEIN)

--I screwed up but I wasn't wrong.

BRADLEE

You guys haven't been wrong yet, is

that why you're scared shitless?

(as WOODWARD and

BERNSTEIN nod, BRADLEE

starts away)

You should be...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

SENATOR

Although I am a Republican, I would

like to state in a pure bipartisan

spirit that I feel only sadness that

a once fine journal of record like

the Post would have become merely

the hysterical spokesman for the

equally hysterical left wing of the

Democratic Party--

CUT TO:

CREEP P.R. MAN

(in mid-sentence)

--hearsay, innuendo, and character

assassination. I can only conclude

that the so-called sources of the

Washington Post are a fountain of

misinformation--

CUT TO:

WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN

--the White House has long since

stopped being surprised at this type

of reporting by certain elements of

the Eastern liberal press--

CUT TO:

SIMONS

(reading)

Same kind of crap--

BRADLEE

(glancing through;

nods)

--all non-denial denials--we're dirty

guys and they doubt we were ever

virgins but they don't say the story

is inaccurate.

BERNSTEIN

What's a real denial?

BRADLEE

If they ever start calling us goddamn

liars--

(little pause)

--it's time to start circling the

wagons.

CUT TO:

FIRST UNION GUY

You think they know what they're

doing on the fifth floor?

SECOND UNION GUY

I got eight kids to support--they

better.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

What do you think Mrs. Graham wants

to see me for?

SIMONS

Maybe to fire you--since you two

started on this story, the Post stock

has dropped, what, 50 percent?

(WOODWARD pushes for

the elevator)

And the word is some Nixon people

are challenging her TV licenses. I'm

not saying she's going on relief,

but I don't think it's unreasonable

for her to want to meet you.

WOODWARD

You think she wants us to ease up on

the story?

SIMONS

(shrugs)

I don't know, but I don't think that's

unreasonable either, do you?

CUT TO:

MRS. GRAHAM

I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--

WOODWARD

--I'm Woodward.

MRS. GRAHAM

You know, the paper was my father's

and my husband's when they were alive

and I was thinking back a year or

two ago when Ben called me and said

he wanted to publish the Pentagon

Papers the next day. The Times had

already been stopped from publishing

anymore of them and all my legal

counsel said "don't, don't" and I

was frightened but I knew if I said

no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor.

So we published, and that night,

after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I

woke up in the darkness and I thought,

"Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this

newspaper?"

(She looks at WOODWARD)

I woke up again last night with that

same question.

(WOODWARD says nothing,

waits)

Are we right on this story?

WOODWARD

I think so.

MRS. GRAHAM

Are you sure?

WOODWARD

No.

MRS. GRAHAM

When will you be, do you think?--

when are we going to know it all?

WOODWARD

It may never come out.

MRS. GRAHAM

Never? Please don't tell me never.

(beat)

Ben says you've found some wonderful

sources.

WOODWARD

Some Justice Department lawyers and

an FBI man, and some people from the

Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.

MRS. GRAHAM

And the underground garage one.

(WOODWARD, more nervous

now, nods)

Would I know him?

WOODWARD

I couldn't say.

MRS. GRAHAM

But it's possible.

WOODWARD

(throat very dry)

It is.

MRS. GRAHAM

You've never told anyone who he is?

(WOODWARD shakes his

head)

But you'd have to tell me if I asked

you.

(WOODWARD nods)

Tell me.

WOODWARD

(he is dying)

I would, if you really ever wanted

to know.

MRS. GRAHAM

I really want to know.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MRS. GRAHAM

I wasn't serious. I have plenty of

burdens to carry around, I don't

need another.

MRS. GRAHAM

We're going to need lots of good

luck, aren't we?

WOODWARD

Nobody ever had too much.

CUT TO:

MRS. GRAHAM

Do better.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

What?

BRADLEE

I thought you guys were supposed to

be working on this story--

(to BERNSTEIN who

tears in--)

--you think I like being aced out?

BERNSTEIN

--what?--

WOODWARD

--The L.A. Times has a huge interview

with Baldwin--

BERNSTEIN

--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--

(WOODWARD nods)

--he say anything we don't know?--

WOODWARD

(headshake)

--just that a lot of reports were

sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name

who, not here anyway--

BRADLEE

--it would have been nice to have

had this, I sure would have liked to

have had this--

BERNSTEIN

--there's nothing new in it--

BRADLEE

--it makes the break-in real--it's a

major goddamn story--

(starts out)

--I'm not going to kick ass over

this, but I'd like you to know I

hate getting beat, I just hate it--

don't forget that I hate it--

BERNSTEIN

Goddamnit--

WOODWARD

--shit--

BERNSTEIN

--we gotta top the Times--

WOODWARD

--I know, I know--

BERNSTEIN

--if we could name the guys got the

reports, we'd be ahead again--

WOODWARD

--shit, who do we know?--

BERNSTEIN

--I know a lawyer at Justice--

WOODWARD

--has he got an ax?--

BERNSTEIN

--almost every source we've used has

been Republican, this guy's a card-

carrying Democrat.

WOODWARD

Then he's got an ax.

(beat)

Call him anyway.

CUT TO:

FIRST UNION GUY

Who is this Woodstein?

(points to paper)

Two stories on the front page.

SECOND UNION GUY

If he can't pick a winner at Pimlico,

to hell with him.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

--I want you to shut up and listen

to me--

WOODWARD

--I haven't said anything--

BERNSTEIN

--for the first time I'm beginning

to feel like a fucking reporter--

Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called

me up with a tip--

(carefully)

--someone named Donald Segretti

contacted a bunch of lawyers and

asked them if they'd like to go to

work with him screwing up the

Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like

that. The FBI knows about Segretti--

Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone

calls to him--they interrogated him,

but on account of Segretti wasn't

involved with the break-in, they

didn't follow through. But Segretti

did a lot of traveling--he called

these lawyers from different places,

and he told them the Republicans

knew what he was doing.

WOODWARD

How high up, which Republicans?

BERNSTEIN

That's what we've got to find out,

but Segretti went to Southern Cal.

and so did a bunch of Nixon men--

WOODWARD

--Haldeman I know, who else?

BERNSTEIN

Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments

chief--he knew Segretti in school.

Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the

first time any of this starts to

make sense. What were the three

theories?

WOODWARD

The burglary was done by Cubans or

Democrats or Republicans.

BERNSTEIN

Now the reason no one believed the

Republicans is because there wasn't

any reason, they were so far ahead.

But Segretti was talking to these

other lawyers a year before the break-

in.

WOODWARD

So maybe Watergate wasn't really

about Watergate--maybe that was just

a piece--

BERNSTEIN

--because a year before, the

Republicans weren't ahead, not in

the polls, Muskie was running ahead

of Nixon then. Before he self-

destructed.

WOODWARD

If he self-destructed.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Segretti criss-crossed the country

over ten times in six months--and

never stayed anyplace over a night

or two.

(glancing up)

Switch to another station, huh? You're

driving me crazy with that.

BERNSTEIN

Segovia begged me for me secret but

I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to

try and make it without me."

WOODWARD

(pointing to the

thickest stacks)

California, Illinois, Florida, New

Hampshire--all the major Democratic

primary states.

(whirling)

Why does everything you play sound

the same?

BERNSTEIN

--'cause I only know four chords--

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN (V.O.)

Donald Segretti?

SEGRETTI

That's right.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

I'm Carl Bernstein.

(SEGRETTI nods)

My paper sent me out to see if I

couldn't persuade you to go on the

record.

SEGRETTI

You can't.

BERNSTEIN

Mind if I try?

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

According to what we've been able to

verify, you've been busy.

SEGRETTI

I've got a lot of energy.

BERNSTEIN

Listen--we know you're involved in

this--we're going to get the story,

why not help?

SEGRETTI

They never told me anything except

my own role--I had to find out the

rest in the papers.

BERNSTEIN

By "they" you mean...?

BERNSTEIN

By "they" you mean the White House,

don't you?

(SEGRETTI makes no

reply)

Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin--

he works for the White House.

SEGRETTI

I know where Dwight works.

BERNSTEIN

When did he hire you?

BERNSTEIN

Do you feel much about the things

you did?

SEGRETTI

I didn't do anything wrong.

BERNSTEIN

Tell that to Muskie.

SEGRETTI

Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.

BERNSTEIN

During the Florida primary, you wrote

a letter on Muskie stationery saying

Scoop Jackson had a bastard child.

You wrote another that said Hubert

Humphrey was out with call girls.

SEGRETTI

Sometimes it got up to a quarter

maybe--

(to BERNSTEIN)

--off the record.

BERNSTEIN

You wrote the Canuck letter--the one

where you claimed Muskie slurred the

Canadians.

SEGRETTI

I didn't.

BERNSTEIN

But you know who did.

SEGRETTI

When you guys print it in the paper,

then I'll know.

(closes his eyes)

I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go

to jail, and be disbarred, and what

did I do that was so awful?

SEGRETTI

None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't

go looking for the job.

BERNSTEIN

Chapin did contact you then?

SEGRETTI

Sure--off the record.

BERNSTEIN

On the orders of Haldeman?

SEGRETTI

I don't know anything about Haldeman,

except, Dwight's frightened of him--

everybody's frightened of him--Christ,

I wish I'd never gotten messed around

with this--all I wanna do is sit in

the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.

BERNSTEIN

It gets interesting if it was

Haldeman, because our word is that

when Chapin says something, he's

gotten the OK from Haldeman, and

when Haldeman says something, he's

gotten the OK from the President.

SEGRETTI

Can't help you.

BERNSTEIN

At USC, you had a word the this--

screwing up the opposition you all

did it at college and called it

ratfucking.

(SEGRETTI half-smiles,

nods)

Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out

to be the biggest ratfucker of them

all?

CUT TO:

SEGRETTI

What would you have done if you were

just getting out of the Army, if

you'd been away from the real world

for four years, if you weren't sure

what kind of law you wanted to

practice, and then one day you got a

call from an old friend asking you

to go to work for the President of

the United States...?

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

What would you have done?

WOODWARD

You asking would I have been one of

the President's men?

(beat)

I would have been.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DEEP THROAT

My turn to keep you waiting.

(approaches)

What's the topic for tonight?

WOODWARD

Ratfucking.

DEEP THROAT

In my day, it was simply called the

double cross. I believe the CIA refers

to it as Mindfuck. In our context,

it simply means infiltration of the

Democrats.

WOODWARD

I know what it means--Segretti

wouldn't go on the record, but if he

would, we know he'd implicate Chapin.

And that would put us inside the

White House.

DEEP THROAT

(nods)

Yes, the little ratfuckers are now

running our government.

WOODWARD

Who?--be specific. How high up?

DEEP THROAT

You'll have to find that out, won't

you.

WOODWARD

The slush fund at CREEP financed the

ratfucking, we've almost got that

nailed down, so--

WOODWARD

What?

DEEP THROAT

Did you change cabs?

(as WOODWARD nods)

It didn't work, something moved there--

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ZOOM TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Who are you?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Here.

(softly)

Forget your troubles and just be

happy.

CUT TO:

DEEP THROAT

(self-mocking)

I hope you noticed how coolly I

behaved under the threat of discovery.

WOODWARD

(impatiently)

Do Justice and the FBI know what we

know, and why the hell haven't they

done anything about it?

DEEP THROAT

They know, but they focused on the

burglary--if it didn't deal with the

break-in, they didn't pursue it.

WOODWARD

Why didn't they?--who told them not

to?

DEEP THROAT

Someone with authority I'd imagine,

wouldn't you?

(coughs)

Don't you know what you're onto?

Come on.

WOODWARD

Mitchell knew then.

DEEP THROAT

Of course--my God, you think something

this big just happens? The break-in

and the cover up, of course Mitchell

knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.

WOODWARD

Haldeman too?

DEEP THROAT

You get nothing from me about

Haldeman?

WOODWARD

Why did they do all this for

Chrissakes?--what were they after?

DEEP THROAT

Total manipulation. I suppose you

could say they wanted to subvert the

Constitution, but they don't think

along philosophical lines.

WOODWARD

Talk about Segretti--

DEEP THROAT

--don't concentrate on Segretti or

you'll miss the overall scheme too.

WOODWARD

There were more then.

DEEP THROAT

Follow every lead--every lead goes

somewhere--

WOODWARD

--the Canuck letter--was that a White

House operation--

DEEP THROAT

(nods, bigger)

--don't you miss the grand scheme

too.

WOODWARD

How grand?

DEEP THROAT

Nationwide--my God, they were

frightened of Muskie and look who

got destroyed--they wanted to run

against McGovern, and look who they're

running against. They bugged, they

followed people, false press leaks,

fake letters, they canceled Democratic

campaign rallies, they investigated

Democratic private lives, they planted

spies, stole documents, on and on--

don't tell me you think this was all

the work of little Don Segretti.

WOODWARD

And Justice and FBI know all this?

DEEP THROAT

Yes, yes, everything. There were

over fifty people employed by the

White House and CREEP to ratfuck--

some of what they did is beyond

belief.

WOODWARD

(stunned)

Fifty ratfuckers directed by the

White House to destroy the Democrats?

CUT TO:

DEEP THROAT

I was being cautious.

(inhales)

You can safely say more then fifty...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BERGER

Do you guys know about the Canuck

letter?

BERNSTEIN

(nods, drinks)

Um-hmm.

(stops, looks at her)

Why?

BERGER

I just wanted to be sure you knew

who wrote it.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

(hysterical)

Tell him what you just told me.

BERGER

Just than Ken Clawsen--he used to be

a reporter here before he went to

work for Nixon--I had him over for a

drink a few weeks ago and he told me

he wrote the Canuck letter.

(she looks from one

of them to the other)

You did want to know, didn't you?

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

You think we're being set up?--Christ,

Deep Throat tells you last night

that the letter came from inside the

White House and up traipses Marilyn

naming names.

WOODWARD

It makes a crazy kind of sense--

remember that initiation rite they

have at the White House? Each new

member of the President's staff has

to prove his guts by getting an enemy

of Nixon.

BERNSTEIN

You think this was Clawsen's

initiation?

WOODWARD

Could have won him a fraternity paddle

with a White House seal.

(beat)

God knows it worked.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD (V.O.)

You claiming it was all a

misunderstanding, Ken?

CLAWSEN (V.O.)

Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it

totally wrong--

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

She's an awfully good reporter--I

can't remember her getting too much

wrong before, can you?

CLAWSEN (V.O.)

That's a bullshit question, that's a

question straight out of Wichita,

Kansas.

WOODWARD

Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing:

where did your talk with Berger

happen?

CLAWSEN (V.O.)

Where?

(beat)

What do you mean, where?

WOODWARD

Well, was it in a bar, her apartment,

some restaurant--

CLAWSEN (V.O.)

--I've completely forgotten where it

was, except I know it wasn't her

apartment.

WOODWARD

Non denial-denial, Marilyn--

CUT TO:

CLAWSEN (V.O.)

For Chissakes, don't tell them I

came to your place.

BERGER

I already told them.

CLAWSEN (V.O.)

Oh, that's terrific, that's just so

terrific, I'm thrilled you did that.

BERGER

I have a clear conscience.

CLAWSEN (V.O.)

Marilyn, I have a wife and a family

and a cat and a dog.

CUT TO:

BRADLEE

I got Clawsen on hold--

WOODWARD

--his dialing finger must be falling

off--

BRADLEE

--what do you think?--

WOODWARD

--he went to her apartment and he

told her--

BERNSTEIN

--if he did it or just said he did

it, God knows.

BRADLEE

I could care less about where it

happened; what happened is what

counts.

(calling out to his

SECRETARY)

Put him on.

(picks up the phone)

Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut

and they were having a crisis, what's

up, kid?

(pause)

Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.

(pause)

A wife and a family and a cat and a

dog, right, Ken.

(pause)

Ken, I would never print that you

were in Marilyn's apartment at night--

unless, of course, you force me to.

CUT TO:

BRADLEE

It's like they taught us at Harvard:

few things are as gratifying to the

soul as having another man's nuts in

a vise...

CUT TO:

WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN

The story is based entirely on hearsay

and--

CREEP P.R. MAN

--we at the Committee are continually

amazed at the creativity shown by

the Washington Post--

WESTERN SENATOR

--although I am a Republican, I would

like to state in a pure bipartisan

spirit that I am happy that this

latest onslaught against the

intelligence of the American people

will be wrapping fish tomorrow. I

offer my condolences to the fish...

CUT TO:

ROSENFELD

Speak.

BERNSTEIN

We've just been talking to Young--

SIMONS

--which Young?

WOODWARD

Larry Young, a California lawyer--

BERNSTEIN

--he was going to go into law practice

with Segretti.

ROSENFELD

And?--

WOODWARD

--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--

SIMONS

--well and good, but when will he

say it on the record.

WOODWARD

He just did.

BERNSTEIN

He'll give us a sworn statement.

WOODWARD

We're inside the White House now.

BRADLEE

Look, I wanted to talk because things

are getting really hairy and there's

a couple of things we've got to be

careful of because--

BRADLEE

--either of you want a drink or should

I order?--

(They don't)

--because--

BRADLEE

--because our cocks are on the

chopping block and you've got to be

sure that you're not just dealing

with people who hate Richard Nixon

and want to get him through us. You

see, I don't give a shit who's

President--I really don't, it's an

adversary situation between them and

us and it's always gonna be. I never

had a closer friend than Jack Kennedy

and once I printed something that

pissed him off and for seven months

I didn't exist.

MAN

You none of you know who I am, do

you?

(they don't)

You screw me up good, you don't even

know what I look like.

BRADLEE

OK, you've had your preamble; who

the hell are you?

MAN

Glenn Sedam--you wrote about me last

week, you said I was one of the guys

at the Committee who was sent reports.

You were wrong.

BERNSTEIN

Baldwin told the FBI it was you.

SEDAM

Baldwin told the FBI it was someone

whose first name sounded like a last

name. They showed him a list and he

picked me but it wasn't me, it was

Gordon Liddy.

(looks at the reporters)

My phone hasn't stopped ringing, my

wife's hysterical, my kids think I'm

mixed up with the burglary, my friends

don't like me around all of a sudden.

CUT TO:

SEDAM

You fucked around my life, you two.

(starts off)

I just wanted to say thanks.

BRADLEE

That didn't sound to me like a non-

denial denial; could you have been

wrong?

(they nod)

You had a good source?

(nod)

Did he have an ax?

(pause. Then another

nod)

BRADLEE

All right, you made a mistake maybe,

we all have, just don't make another.

And watch your personal lives, who

you hang around with. Someone once

said the price of democracy is a

bloodletting every ten years.

(beat)

Make sure it isn't our blood...

CUT TO:

SLOAN

I really can't talk now--

BERNSTEIN

--this'll only take one second--

SLOAN

--my wife just had the baby, my in-

laws are arriving, I'm trying to get

the house in some kind of shape.

WOODWARD

A boy or a girl?

SLOAN

A girl. Melissa.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

(holding up a cup)

Where does this go?

WOODWARD

--That cash fund that financed the

sabotaging of the Democrats--five

guys had control--

BERNSTEIN

(ticking them off)

--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--

WOODWARD

--we're working on the last guy now

and we're going all the way--that

fifth man was Haldeman.

SLOAN

--I'm not your source on that--

BERNSTEIN

--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone

from the White House had to be

involved--

WOODWARD

--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson

or the President.

SLOAN

No, none of those.

BERNSTEIN

--that leaves Haldeman, period.

SLOAN

I'm not your source on that.

WOODWARD

(taking the dust pan,

helping out)

--look, when the Watergate grand

jury questioned you, did you name

names?

SLOAN

Of course--everything they asked--

BERNSTEIN

--if we wrote a story that said

Haldeman controlled the fund?--

SLOAN

--let me put it this way: I'd have

no problem if you did.

CUT TO:

WOODWARD'S VOICE (V.O.)

Hey?

WOODWARD

I think that's him.

BERNSTEIN

Who?

WOODWARD

Haldeman.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

Nah.

(squints hard)

Maybe.

WOODWARD

What if I went up and introduced

myself--think he'd slug me?

BERNSTEIN

Well, we are trying to ruin his life.

WOODWARD

It's nothing personal, though.

(looks troubled)

BERNSTEIN

What's the matter?

WOODWARD

Same as Magruder, I don't like it

when they turn out to be human.

BERNSTEIN

(nods)

I wish we were investigating Attila

the Hun.

WOODWARD

Maybe we are...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PUDGY MAN

--Goddamnit, I'm not gonna say it

again--you get nothing about Haldeman

outta me--

WOODWARD

--we don't need it now, because

tomorrow's story is about the FBI--

BERNSTEIN

--about how all you supposed experts

really blew the whole investigation--

FBI GUY

(stung)

--we didn't miss so much--

WOODWARD

--you never knew Haldeman had control

of the slush fund--

FBI GUY

--it's all in our files--

BERNSTEIN

--not about Haldeman--

FBI GUY

--yeah, Haldeman, John Haldeman.

BERNSTEIN

--Jesus--

WOODWARD

--he said John Haldeman, not Bob

Haldeman--

CUT TO:

BRADLEE

(staring at the typed

story)

--I don't know, I don't know, it

feels thin--

SIMONS

--Christ, I wish I knew if we should

print this--

ROSENFELD

--listen, we didn't make them do

these things--once they did, it's

our job to report it--

SIMONS

(to the reporters)

--go over your sources again--

WOODWARD

--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he

answered everything they asked him--

that means there's a record somewhere--

BERNSTEIN

--and the FBI confirms--what more do

you need?--

ROSENFELD

(whirling to BERNSTEIN)

--listen, I love this country, you

think I want to bring it down?--I'm

not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--

SIMONS

--Harry, weren't you just arguing

the opposite way?--

ROSENFELD

--maybe I'm tense--

BRADLEE

--well shit, we oughtta be tense--

we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman

who only happens to be the second

most important man in America of

conducting a criminal conspiracy

from inside the White House--

(beat)

--it would be nice if we were right--

SIMONS

(to the reporters)

--you double-checked both sources?--

BRADLEE

--Bernstein, are you sure on this

story?

BERNSTEIN

Absolutely--

BRADLEE

(to WOODWARD)

--what about you?--

WOODWARD

--I'm sure--

BRADLEE

--I'm not sure, it still feels thin--

(looks at SIMONS)

SIMONS

(to WOODWARD and

BERNSTEIN, after a

puse)

--get another source.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

How many fucking sources they think

we got?--

WOODWARD

--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never

thought he was scared of anyone, but

he's scared of Haldeman.

BERNSTEIN

I know a guy in the Justice Department

who was around the Grand Jury.

(looks at WOODWARD)

WOODWARD

--We got twenty minutes to deadline--

CUT TO:

LAWYER'S VOICE (O.S.)

(barely audible)

...You shouldn't ever call me like

this, Carl...

BERNSTEIN

Will you confirm that Haldeman was

mentioned by Sloan to the Grand Jury?

LAWYER'S VOICE (O.S.)

...I won't say anything about

Haldeman... not ever...

BERNSTEIN

(desperate)

All right--listen--it's against the

law if you talk about the Grand Jury,

right? But you don't have to say a

thing--I'll count to ten--if the

story's wrong, hang up before I get

there--if it's OK stay on the line

till after, got it?

LAWYER (O.S.)

Hang up, right?

BERNSTEIN

Right, right--OK, counting: one, two--

(he inhales deeply)

--three, four, five, six--

(now he's starting to

get excited)

--seven, eight--

(inhales deeply)

--nine, ten, thank you.

LAWYER (O.S.)

You've got it straight now? Everything

OK?

BERNSTEIN

(on a note of triumph)

Yeah!

CUT TO:

"TESTIMONY TIES TOP NIXON AIDE TO SECRET FUND"

CUT TO:

WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN

On the record let me say just this:

the story is totally untrue. On

background, I'd like to add that Bob

Haldeman is one of the greatest public

servants this country has ever had

and the story is a goddamned lie.

NOW FAST ZOOM TO:

BRADLEE

Woodstein!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SCHORR

Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment

on your testimony before the Grand

Jury.

SLOAN

My lawyer says--

SLOAN'S LAWYER

--the answer is an unequivocal no.

Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr.

Haldeman in that testimony at all.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FBI MAN

--I'll deny everything--everything--

I never talked to you about Haldeman--

I never talked to you about anything--

I'm not talking to you now--

BERNSTEIN

--what went wrong?--

WOODWARD

--for Chrissakes just tell that--

PUDGY FBI MAN

--fuck you fuck you fuck you--

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

(after a while)

Woodward?

WOODWARD

Hmm?

BERNSTEIN

What was the mistake? Do you think

it's been rigged, all along the way,

leading us on so they could slip it

to us when it mattered? They couldn't

have set us up better; after all

these months our credibility's gone,

you know what that means?

WOODWARD

(nods)

Only everything...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SIMONS

(indicating the papers)

More denunciations?

ROSENFELD

(nods)

One Senator just gave a speech

slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.

SIMONS

What's this?

BRADLEE

My non-denial denial.

ROSENFELD

We're not printing a retraction?

CUT TO:

BRADLEE

Fuck it, let's stand by the boys.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

Hello?

BERNSTEIN'S VOICE (O.S.)

What'd you find?

WOODWARD

Jesus Christ, what time is it?

BERNSTEIN

You overslept?

WOODWARD

Goddamnit!--

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ZOOM TO:

DEEP THROAT

--you were doing so well and then

you got stupid, you went too fast--

Christ, what a royal screw up--

WOODWARD

--I know, I know, the pressure's off

the White House and it's all back on

the Post--

DEEP THROAT

--you've done worse than let Haldeman

slip away, you've got people feeling

sorry for him--I didn't think that

was possible. A conspiracy like this--

the rope has to tighten slowly around

everyone's neck. You build from the

outer edges and you go step by step.

If you shoot too high and miss, then

everybody feels more secure. You've

put the investigation back months.

WOODWARD

We know that--and if we were wrong,

we're resigning--were we wrong?

DEEP THROAT

You'll have to find that out, won't

you?--

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

--I'm tired of your chickenshit games--

I don't want hints, I want what you

know!

CUT TO:

DEEP THROAT

It was a Haldeman operation--the

whole business--he ran the money,

but he was insulated, you'll have to

find out how--

DEEP THROAT

--wait--

(almost a smile)

--there's more...

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

We gotta go see Bradlee--I'll fill

you in in the car.

CUT TO:

BRADLEE

You couldn't have told me over the

phone?

CUT TO:

WOODWARD

We can't trust the phones, not

anymore. Deep Throat says so.

BRADLEE

We can't talk inside either?

WOODWARD

(headshake)

Electronic surveillance.

CUT TO:

BERNSTEIN

I finally got through to Sloan--it

was all a misunderstanding that we

had: he would have told the Grand

Jury about Haldeman, he was ready

to, only nobody on the Grand Jury

asked him the goddamn question.

WOODWARD

So I guess you could say that we

screwed up, but we weren't wrong.

BRADLEE

Anything else from Mr. Throat?

WOODWARD

Mitchell started the cover-up early,

everyone is involved in the cover-

up, all the way to the top. The whole

U.S. intelligence community is mixed

in with the covert activities. The

extent of it is incredible.

(little pause)

And people's lives are in danger,

maybe including ours.

CUT TO:

BRADLEE

He's wrong on that last, we're not

in the least danger, because nobody

gives a shit--what was that Gallup

Poll result? Half the country's never

even heard the word Watergate.

CUT TO:

BRADLEE

Look, you're both probably a little

tired, right?

(They nod)

You should be, you've been under a

lot of pressure. So go home, have a

nice hot bath, rest up fifteen minutes

if you want before you get your asses

back in gear--

(louder now)

--because we're under a lot of

pressure, too, and you put us there--

not that I want it to worry you--

nothing's riding on you except the

First Amendment of the Constitution

plus the freedom of the press plus

the reputation of a hundred-year-old

paper plus the jobs of the two

thousand people who work there--

(still building)

--but none of that counts as much as

this: you fuck up again, I'm gonna

lose my temper.

(pause; softer)

I promise you, you don't want me to

lose my temper.

(shooing them off)

Move-move-move--what have you done

for me tomorrow...?

CUT TO:

WESTERN SENATOR (O.S.)

Although I'm a Republican, I would

like to state in a pure bipartisan

spirit tht the greatest political

scandal of this campaign is the brazen

manner in which, without benefit of

clergy, the Washington Post has set

up housekeeping with the McGovern

campaign...

CREEP P.R. MAN

For twenty years, the Eastern liberal

press has been trying to smear Dick

Nixon. Fortunately, the American

public is too smart to be fooled

by...

WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN

I have been informed reliably by

John Dean that no one connected with

the White House...

WESTERN SENATOR

(coming in, overlapping)

It is only our pathetic Post that

deliberately tries to infuse the

Watergate caper with a seriousness

far beyond those shenanigans that

have been the stock trade of political

pranksters ever since...

WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN

An insult to the American public--

CREEP P.R. MAN

--the deplorable tactics employed by

the Washington Post--

WESTERN SENATOR

--I have been given access to evidence

in possession of the White House and

that evidence--

WESTERN SENATOR

Well, if I was wrong, I sure the

hell wasn't alone--

CREEP

--the fact remains that except for

Watergate, we ran one hell of a great

campaign...

FINAL FADE OUT:

THE END
