VOICE-OVER

There used to be a staff of fifty in

this place. I'm the only one left

from those days. It all comes down

to one sap: the night-shift bellhop,

that's me. What the hell is a bellhop?

You know where the name comes from?

(silence)

Of course not... It's so simple it's

stupid. They ring a bell and you

hop. You hop to front and center. No

heroes in this line, kid. Just men

doing a job. No questions asked,

none answered. I try to keep it

simple, kid, not too personal...

TED

You met any of those old stars?

THE OLD GUY

Stars! Are you kidding me? I took

Rin Tin Tin out for a shit, for

Christ's sakes. I taught Shirley

Temple how to roller-skate. I saw

Fatty Arbuckle regurgitate three

cheese sandwiches right on the spot

you're sitting, kid. What did you

say your name was?

TED

Ted.

THE OLD GUY

Ted, right. I remember Marilyn used

to come down at night and doze off

in the kitchen. She liked the sound

of the fans out back spinning around.

Sure, these were stars, kid. Errol

Flynn used to call me "Alibi." You'll

pick up a few stories yourself, kid.

TED

I don't think so, not like yours.

THE OLD GUY

What do you think a star does when

he goes to the bathroom, kid?

TED

Beats me.

THE OLD GUY

He pulls his pants down and takes a

crap just like you and me. Take my

word for it.

THE OLD GUY

Camacho!

TED

Who?

THE OLD GUY

The cigar. Cuban. A good cigar,

wrapped in Miami. I get a box of

them every Christmas from the chairman

of the board. I think he sends them

to me to keep my mouth shut. It's

tough not to get a little personal

in this business.

TED

What do you mean?

THE OLD GUY

Put it on.

THE OLD GUY

Frankly, you look stupid... like the

Philip Morris guy. I can't believe I

wore that thing for fifty years. You

keep it.

THE OLD GUY

Stay away from night clerks, kids,

hookers, and marital disputes.

THE OLD GUY

Never have sex with the clientele.

TED

No way, not me. You got any other

advice.

THE OLD GUY

Always get a tip.

BETTY

Sam! Hey, Sam, wait a minute!

THE OLD GUY

What?

BETTY

I just want to say good-bye.

THE OLD GUY

Who are you?

BETTY

Uhhh, Betty. The concierge. Your

boss.

THE OLD GUY

Oh yeah. Gotta light, sister? Goddam

cigar went out.

BETTY

Yeah, sure.

BETTY

I just want you to know, from the

owner and all the staff, your fifty

years of service have been an

inspiration to us all. You're a legend

in your own time, and the Mon Signor

will never be the --

THE OLD GUY

Just forward my cigars, Red.

(He turns around the

walks out, saying

over his shoulder)

Aufwiedersehen!

TED

Sam the bellboy. Now there was a

man.

BETTY

Yeah. Oh, hi, Teddy. Ready to start

the night shift?

TED

Yeah.

BETTY

Well, let me buy you a drink.

TED

You wanna buy me a drink? I'm starting

my shift.

BETTY

You're not an alcoholic, are you;

one drink won't kill you.

TED

Yeah, sure.

BETTY

After fifty years, Sam retires, and

you're taking over the night shift.

TED

Correct.

BETTY

You're filling some mighty big shoes.

TED

Oh, I know.

BETTY

Sam was a legend in the hotel

business.

TED

Oh, I know...

BETTY

A bellhop's bellhop.

TED

An inspiration to us all.

BETTY

He ran the night desk for fifty years,

all by himself.

TED

An amazing man.

BETTY

No desk clerk. No night man. No help.

Just fuckin' Sam, and his wits.

TED

A man alone.

BETTY

And you're gonna do the same.

TED

I know.

BETTY

Tonight.

TED

Tonight!

BETTY

Yes, tonight.

TED

I can't.

BETTY

Yes, you can.

TED

No, I can't. I never worked the night

shift before.

BETTY

Oh night shift -- smight shift.

TED

We were supposed to work it together.

BETTY

I know, but I can't.

TED

Why not?

BETTY

I'm having a New Year's Eve party.

TED

Since when?

BETTY

Actually, I'm not having it. My

roommate is. And there's this guy.

German guy. He's gonna be there. And

so am I.

TED

I can't run this place by myself.

BETTY

Oh, sure ya can.

TED

No, I can't.

BETTY

Sam ran this place by himself for

fifty years.

TED

Yeah, and he had fifty years of

fuckin' practice, too. I haven't had

a day.

BETTY

Look, Teddy, calm down --

TED

-- Don't call me Teddy.

BETTY

Ted, the night's cake. It's easy.

The day's when it's busy. During the

night there's nothing to do.

TED

It's New Year's Eve.

BETTY

Which'll make it less busy than

normal. Ever worked on Christmas?

Unless you sell turkeys, business is

dead. You just got butterflies, that's

all.

TED

What I have ain't butterflies. I

can't handle this hotel all by myself.

BETTY

Okay, let's calm down a minute. Slow

it down, cool it off. Let's just

talk.

TED

You can say any goddamn thing you

want --

BETTY

-- Ted? I thought we were calming

down? I thought we were cooling off?

No hostility. Say good-bye to

hostility. We're just talking.

TED

Okay... okay... okay... I'm calm,

I'm cool, let's talk.

BETTY

Ted, in a nutshell, all you have to

do is hold the fort. It's New Year's

Eve. Most of the guests are going

out. You'll just be giving them a

little nod as they come staggering

in at three... four... five... in

the morning. Nobody's having any

parties, a few get-togethers, but no

parties. You got about three people

checking in tonight, that's it. The

only variable is Chester Rush in the

penthouse.

TED

Chester Rush? The guy from The Wacky

Detective?

BETTY

Yeah, him and his entourage checked

in last night. They're in the

penthouse. The only reason I refer

to it as a variable is that he's a

movie star. Ya never know about movie

stars. I'm tellin' ya, Ted, it's

cake.

BETTY

(continuing)

And look, if you have any problems,

call me at the party.

TED

Okay.

BETTY

Great --

TED

-- For fifty bucks.

BETTY

Fifty bucks!

TED

You're shirking your duties for this

Nazi. For that you pay a price, and

the price is fifty bucks.

BETTY

One, Horst is not a Nazi. Two, that's

not a fair price. You're taking

advantage of the situation. Twenty

bucks. Now, twenty bucks is a fair

price.

TED

Yeah, but what you're doin' to me

ain't fair. And, you are completely

and totally taking advantage of me

and your position. So fifty bucks is

the perfect price.

BETTY

Okay, but don't be a pussy. You don't

bother me unless it's an emergency.

In fact, for fifty bucks, you better

not call me unless the fuckin'

building's burning down.

BETTY

Get ready to take the desk.

ROOM 321

"STRANGE BREW"

ATHENA

Pleeze be careful -- my God. You

have no idea...

ATHENA

I'm usually a good tipper, but this

one -- this cab driver -- he had

green all around him. I don't like

that in a man.

TED

Green? Is that bad? Like you read

auras or something like that?

ATHENA

Something like that.

TED

Yeah, well what color are you seein'

around me... how's the tip lookin?

ATHENA

I see purple... in your face, and...

ATHENA

...you're okay.

ATHENA

Athena Z.

TED

(scratching his head --

weird name, okay)

You're booked in the Honeymoon Suite --

just one night? With all this luggage?

ATHENA

I will only need to stay till sunrise.

TED

Okay... and how will you be paying?

ATHENA

With gold.

ATHENA

Well -- the other bag -- I need it.

TED

Right.

TED

What the hell you got in here, lady?

Nuclear weapons?

ATHENA

(dryly)

The White Cliffs of Dover.

ATHENA

The others will be coming soon. Send

them, pleeze.

TED

Oh -- I forgot to show you how to

turn on the Jacuzzi.

ATHENA

I been in dis' place many New Year's.

So... you send the others to me,

huh. Go now.

ATHENA

On this night, oh great goddess Diana,

we restore your virgin flesh and

bring you back to real life.

ATHENA

Soon -- I take you to the pond for a

cleansing. Well, it's a swimming

pool, but it will be under the setting

sun, okay?

TED

May I help you?

ELSPETH

I... we... have a reservation.

ELSPETH

Kiva!

KIVA

Wait up, gawd! I had to get supplies

for this boring ass night.

ELSPETH

(to Ted)

We have a reservation in the Honeymoon

Suite.

TED

Oh yeah... you must be one of "the

others." And what're you carrying --

the Rock of Gibraltar?

ELSPETH

What'd I tell you about smoking?

KIVA

You smoke.

ELSPETH

That's right -- I smoke, and I'm

addicted to it, and I don't want the

same thing to happen to you.

KIVA

(in game-show host

voice)

"Hello -- welcome to this week's

edition of the Hypocrite of the Year

Award --"

ELSPETH

Kiva! That's enough --

KIVA

You're not my mother!

ELSPETH

Yes I am.

KIVA

Then why're we sleeping together?

ELSPETH

Well... I didn't mean it... literally.

I... I happen to be the only one

who... cares about you --

ELSPETH

Please -- take us to our room!

ELSPETH

Flea powder. One of the others is

bringing her cat.

ELSPETH

You're gonna have to wait in the

other room.

KIVA

Why?

ELSPETH

Because I said so.

KIVA

I'll watch TV.

ELSPETH

You can't watch TV because the noise

will interfere with our ritual.

KIVA

Okay... Mommy.

ATHENA

Soon -- our goddess will come. I

will go get her negligee.

ATHENA

What are you doing! Have you no

respect -- who -- who is dis girl?

ELSPETH

Kiva. My friend. Kiva, turn off the

TV! I can't leave her at home --

she's on probation and I gotta keep

an eye on her.

ATHENA

Well, Elspeth, your friend cannot

stay here during the ritual. She may

be one of your kind, but she is not

one of us.

ELSPETH

She stays!! Or I go -- along with my

offering!

ATHENA

TURN OF THE FUCKING TV, MAN!

KIVA

(in a seductive pout)

Make me...

ATHENA

Let's not forget -- I am the High

Fucking Priestess. Deal with dis

girl!

ATHENA

(eyes lifted to heaven,

wearily)

Tell me -- did we have these problems

in Salem? I don't think so...

ELSPETH

Kiva... you know what I love about

you?

ELSPETH

Your sweet side.

KIVA

And what do I get if I'm sweet?

ELSPETH

You get whatever you want. And you

know what else I love about you?

KIVA

(seduced now)

What?

ELSPETH

Your nose.

ELSPETH

And I saw you checking her out.

JEZEBEL

(talking to her cat

in baby talk)

Oh you little stinker... oh you sweet

little muffin. Yes... Mama loves the

baby.

JEZEBEL

Well, this is just darlin'! Just

darlin' Hi-dee, girls...

JEZEBEL

Toodle-loo.

JEZEBEL

Well -- I see Elspeth has herself a

new lil' fool -- what the hell is

she doin' here on our night of annual

ritual?

ATHENA

(wearily)

I have sanctioned her presence, as

long as she behaves. Come on -- there

is more work to be done to welcome

our great Diana.

KIVA

I WANT ROOM SERVICE!!

ELSPETH

Why do I always attract girls who

are looking for a babysitter?

JEZEBEL

Well now, honey, maybe Juvenile Hall

ain't the best place to find serious

relationship material.

RAVEN

I'm looking for the room for making

love.

TED

You might be referring to the

Honeymoon Suite. Straight thata way...

you can't miss it -- see all that

furniture in the hallway --

RAVEN

Oh I know the way. I just wanted you

to know that I knew where I was going

and that you needn't bother yourself

with me. The others are here -- great!

TED

(wearily)

Oh yeah -- it's so great -- it's

fantastic.

RAVEN

(in deep empathy)

Ohhh... I know it all seems very

strange but you're coping with us

much better than the bellboys of

past New Year's.

TED

Past New Year's?

RAVEN

Oh yes -- we've been coming here

every New Year... for a long time.

Thanks for your patience.

TED

Oh hey -- no problem -- wreck the

place. Bring in cats. Ruin the carpet

with flea powder, pour paint in the

Jacuzzi. Throw the furniture out

the... where're your bags?

RAVEN

I travel very light.

TED

(already weary of

these girls)

Yeah, yeah, Honeymoon Suite.

EVA

Oh... yes... I'm late.

TED

All right -- lemme give ya a hand.

EVA

Oh... no, that's all right. I can

carry them by myself.

TED

I'm a man doin' a job -- no hero.

EVA

Well gosh -- thank you!

EVA

Tell me, how long have the others

been here?

TED

About an hour.

ATHENA

You are very late, Eva.

EVA

I'm sorry, Athena. I was attending a

birth and the placenta was late in

coming.

EVA

Oh, wait, lemme give you a little

more than that...

ELSPETH

Which birth is more important to

you, that of a mortal or that of a

goddess?

EVA

All life is precious... but I do

apologize for being late, Elspeth.

JEZEBEL

Back home, they jist yank on the

umbilical cord, do a Karate chop on

the mama's belly, and them things

come right out.

EVA

They do that here, too, Jezebel, in

the hospitals, but it causes

hemorrhages. I fed the mother a bowl

of comfrey tea and it brought the

afterbirth down perfectly. The couple

are going to use it for fertilizer

to plant a lovely tree for their

baby.

KIVA

Oh wow -- if they were really back-

to-nature, they'd eat it, like other

mammals do.

RAVEN

In some Native American cultures,

they dry the umbilical cord, grind

it to a fine powder, and put it in a

leather pouch that the baby wears to

ward off evil. But burying the

placenta is also a very sound

ecological practice -- 'cause of the

oxygen it carries.

EVA

(cheerfully to the

others)

Yes -- because you see when the

placenta detaches from the uterine

wall...

TED

(wincing in disgust)

Uh, thank you, ladies -- I'll be

going now. If you need anything --

ATHENA

Wait. We do need a few things.

ATHENA

We need fresh rosemary from the

kitchen. Mostly what we need is from

the kitchen. Hey, are you listening?

TED

Yeah, yeah, rosemary.

ATHENA

And a little bit of sea salt or Kosher

salt if you don't got no sea salt. A

bottle of spring water -- Italian

please, not French shit.

KIVA

And some french fries!

ELSPETH

Kiva, shut up.

ATHENA

(irritated)

And some ginger, two of the eyes of

a trout fish, and a piece of raw

meat, liver if you have it.

KIVA

(whining)

I want fries -- you dumb jerks with

your stupid fucking ritual!

ATHENA

Shut up, you little shit.

ELSPETH

Don't talk to her that way!

ATHENA

Get to work, man.

ELSPETH

Kiva...

KIVA

What?

ELSPETH

You have to go in the next room now.

KIVA

Oh, wow, like I'm bummed out that I

can't watch.

(whining at Elspeth)

I'm bored!

ELSPETH

UP!

KIVA

Don't put me in there by myself.

I'll miss you way too much.

ELSPETH

Kiva, don't do this to me.

KIVA

Please... if you just lemme... I'll

play dress-up with you, the way you

like it... you know what I mean...

remember...?

KIVA

We can pretend and I'll do it

exactly... the way you want it...

with the egg whites and the kilt.

ELSPETH

You mean... like last week?

ELSPETH

We'll talk about this later, Kiva.

KIVA

(angrily)

No!

JEZEBEL

Aw, really now -- child abuse?

ELSPETH

You stay outta this!

ATHENA

I demand this stop now, Elspeth!

KIVA

I'm running away from you!

ELSPETH

Fine. Go ahead. And I'll call your

parole officer and she'll find you

and send you back to Eastlake!

ATHENA

Now that the fucking melodrama is

over, can we start the goddamn ritual --

pleeze?

ATHENA

We are communing here on New Year's

Eve to bring to life the great goddess

Diana, who was turned to stone in

this very room forty years ago today.

ATHENA

Diana, great beautiful one, we make

these offerings to you, that we may

undo the wicked spell which deprived

you of the seed of your lover, your

virginal blood, of your very life.

We now form the symbolic rock with

our bodies.

ATHENA

On this night, in this hour, we Call

upon the Ancient Power O Goddess

bride, I offer thee Milk from a

mother's sweet titty!

ELSPETH

To reverse the evil which has been

done I make this offering to the

Divine One A whore not, an innocent

was, For whom I seized a virgin's

blood.

JEZEBEL

Goddess of Light, Goddess of Lust,

To undo this awful spell is a real

must. To bring you life and get you

high I offer the sweat of five men's

thighs.

RAVEN

Diana, oh great one, we live without

sun Until this wicked curse is undone.

In hope that you live, and to us

appear, I have collected a year's

worth of tears.

EVA

Great Goddess Diana, fail you I will,

I was to bring fresh sperm from my

Bill. I had him erect, and his semen

would follow But alas I was hot, so

hot that I swallowed.

ATHENA

You stupid little witch! You swallowed

the sperm! Aye-yi--yi!

ELSPETH

It just shows what an amazing lack

of control you have over yourself,

Eva!

JEZEBEL

Honey, why didn't you just use your

hands? Didn't your mama teach you

not to put them things in your mouth?

RAVEN

I understand though...

ATHENA

There is no time to cry over swallowed

sperms. You're gonna have to get

some, baby. You have one hour to

prove what kind of witch you really

are.

ATHENA

(calling out)

What do you want?!

TED

Ted... the bellboy.

ATHENA

Mr. Bellboy, come right in!

TED

Here's the things you asked for. Oh,

and uhh, sorry, but I'm not gonna

pick the eyes outta this dead fish.

ATHENA

(handing Ted 50 bucks)

Okay, mister, here's your fifty-dollar

tip, only, you have to do one more

thing... make our little Eva smile.

Can you? We'll leave you alone.

(to Eva, firmly)

And don't use your mouth!

ELSPETH

If she doesn't get his goop in ten

minutes, I'm going to take him myself.

JEZEBEL

Ha! That'll be a first for you.

ELSPETH

Oh shit -- Kiva!

ELSPETH

And just where do you think you're

going?

KIVA

Well, gawd -- I need a candy bar or

something -- you haven't fed me all

day. I'm getting all shaky. My blood

sugar's really low.

JEZEBEL

Elspeth -- honestly now -- some

babysitter you're turnin' out ta be!

ATHENA

Enough, girls. I will collect fresh

earth. Jezebel, I want you to gather

damp moss. Raven, you bring me a

birch branch.

TED

Help me out, lady. I gotta earn this

fifty bucks!

EVA

Oh look, they don't care if I smile

or not! All they want is...

EVA

You won't understand, believe me.

TED

Try me. I've been around, y'know.

EVA

Well... okay. The five of us --

Elspeth, Jezebel, Athena, Raven and

me -- are a coven.

TED

Ha, like a coven of witches?

EVA

Yes.

TED

(stunned)

Oh.

TED

I knew that!

EVA

(getting calmer)

And you see, our coven has spent

forty years trying to perfect a ritual

to undo a wicked curse put on our

goddess Diana.

TED

Gee, you don't look a day over twenty!

EVA

Oh... ha ha... I mean the witches

before us tried and failed. But

Athena, our High Priestess, discovered

a great potion to reverse the evil

spell which turned our beautiful

goddess into an old rock.

TED

(looking at the rock)

Yeah? Is... is that her?

EVA

She was a beautiful virgin. An

entertainer by trade, but a great

sorceress by design. It was here in

this very room, on her wedding night,

a jealous rival placed the curse on

Diana.

TED

She turned to -- that -- here?

EVA

Yes... and her young husband turned

into a pink fish! They found him

swimming in the pool in circles.

While our dear goddess: a stone in

her honeymoon bed.

EVA

This was Diana.

TED

This girl here? This is the goddess

Diana?

TED

I hate to tell you this, but I kinda

doubt she was a virgin.

EVA

Oh, but she was! She had lovers, but

she saved that for marriage. Which

is the example I've tried to follow:

to do everything but that till I

marry...

TED

Hey, don't cry... a virgin is a rare

and beautiful thing. If you say she

was a virgin, I'll believe it.

EVA

Well, it doesn't matter now... and

she won't be resurrected tonight

'cause I failed her. I let my whole

coven down!

TED

Wait a sec -- that rock was gonna

turn back into this?

TED

Now, that would be something worth

seeing!

EVA

Only, not now -- we were each supposed

to bring something -- a life fluid.

TED

(wincing in disgust)

If this is gonna be like one of those

afterbirth conversations, I don't

think I wanna hear this.

EVA

Only... I swallowed it...

TED

You swallowed what?

TED

You mean, you were supposed to

bring... like... like a guy's... and

you...?

EVA

And now, you're my last chance!

TED

(laughing)

Yeah, sure.

(then -- panic)

Whoa, what? You want my -- for the --

witchy poo -- ahh no -- no way --

nope. Besides, it's against hotel

policy. I was warned: "No sex with

the clientele"!

TED

Ha, c'mon now, joke's over.

(seeing this is no

joke)

Hey, we're gonna step in the flea

powder.

EVA

That's not flea powder, that's sacred

dust ground from the horns of Albino

goats.

TED

Right! I knew that!

TED

What's a nice girl like you doing in

a coven, anyway?

EVA

Well, see, what I really want to do

is be a midwife. I've attended four

births already! I can prevent vaginal

tears and everything.

TED

(trying to dodge her

hexing eyes)

Well, that's a good thing! A guy

doesn't like surprises down there.

EVA

I joined the coven to attain greater

understanding of my feminine power

so I could become a truly great

midwife!

TED

(the hex working now)

Oh, well, I see you've been gaining

a lot of insight into your... girl

powers...

EVA

Do you really think so?

TED

(buckling under the

temptation)

Well, yeah, I'd say that seems to be

the case...

(she licks his neck;

his eyes roll back

heavenly)

Ohhh, God! Betty's gonna kill me!

EVA

Who's Betty -- your girlfriend?

TED

No. My boss.

EVA

Oh good!

TED

Oh no!

DISSOLVE TO:

EVA

My phone number in Topanga. Call me?

TED

(cocky)

Sure, baby. Yeah, I'll give ya a

call.

KIVA

What's that used for?

RAVEN

It's a birch branch, symbolizing

eternal life. You can also use the

bark for a tea which assists in astral

travel.

KIVA

Hey -- I wanna be a witch!

EVA

I'm a woman now!

ATHENA

But where is his "stuff"?

EVA

(pointing to the

Jacuzzi)

We did it right there, in the big

cauldron!

JEZEBEL

Ooohhh honey, you're gonna be sore

tomorra! Didn't your mama teach you

that water strips a girl's

lubrication?

RAVEN

Sex in water is great in the movies,

not in real life... but you will

learn. As we all did.

JEZEBEL

Yeah, when she can't walk...

(to Elspeth)

I guess you wouldn't have those kinds

of problems -- without penetration.

ELSPETH

No. And virtually no cervical cancer,

either.

ATHENA

Okay, girls, enough Sex Education

101, let's get going with our ritual,

goddammit.

EVA

Goddess Diana, I offer you The jism

of one I wooed for you That you may

live and know such bliss Of getting

laid by a guy like this.

ALL OF THE WITCHES

So must it be. Three times three

times three.

DISSOLVE TO:

ATHENA

I don't understand what went wrong.

ELSPETH

I say Eva pulled one over on us.

EVA

What?

JEZEBEL

Honey -- Eva was wearing the face of

someone just fucked good... and the

best actress in this world, or any

other, can't fake a thing like that!

ELSPETH

Exactly -- if she was fucked so good,

how could she save his come?

RAVEN

It could be done...

ATHENA

Girls, knock it off.

(she looks up from

the book)

Maybe... maybe it needed to be the

sperm of a virgin male.

EVA

(dreamily)

He was no virgin!

ATHENA

Let's leave her here, with the sword,

until dawn. I will come back for her

before checkout time. I just... feel

too sad to carry her away before the

sun comes up to warm her.

JEZEBEL

(cuddling her cat)

I can't believe we have to carry our

own bags out! My mama would have a

hissy fit!

KIVA

(flirtatiously)

I'll carry your bags.

ELSPETH

(firmly)

You're carrying my bags!

ATHENA

Next year, we try again -- with virgin

sperm.

FOUR ROOMS

TED

Oh, Jesus, what did I tell you? Do

you want milk and cookies, or do you

not?

(pause)

I can't turn on an adult station

without permission from your parents.

(pause, he checks his

computer)

That's not what the machine tells

me.

(pause)

You be good and you'll get milk and

cookies, but for now leave me alone,

please. I'll be up later to put you

both to sleep.

TED

(to himself)

Goddamn kids.

TED

Room Service.

YUPPIE SCUM

What room am I in?

TED

This is the front desk, sir.

YUPPIE SCUM

What room are we in?

REAL THEODORE

How should I know? I just got here.

YUPPIE SCUM

(into phone)

You know, don't you have one of those

light things?

TED

If you care to go to the door and

look on the other side, you'll find

the room number.

YUPPIE SCUM

(to Real Theodore)

Call my assistant and ask her what

floor we're on.

REAL THEODORE

Who's your assistant?

YUPPIE SCUM

The girl you party with every night.

REAL THEODORE

(to himself)

Who?

TED

I'm here alone, sir.

REAL THEODORE

It's room 404, I think.

YUPPIE SCUM

I could have sworn we were on the

fifth floor.

REAL THEODORE

Right. 404.

YUPPIE SCUM

(into phone)

Right. 404.

TED

What do you need, sir?

YUPPIE SCUM

(to Real Theodore)

What do we need?

REAL THEODORE

Ice.

YUPPIE SCUM

Ice?

REAL THEODORE

Ice.

YUPPIE SCUM

(into phone)

Ice.

TED

Ice.

YUPPIE SCUM

Yeah. Ice.

TED

Right, sir. Ice. 404. I'll be with

you momentarily.

CUT TO:

ROOM 404

"THE WRONG MAN"

TED

Anybody home?

MAN'S VOICE

No one here but us chickens.

TED

Say, it's pretty dark in here, sir.

MAN'S VOICE

What do you expect, Theodore, a

fuckin' floor show?

TED

Do I know you?

MAN'S VOICE

I don't know. Do you?

TED

I brought your ice.

SIGFRIED

That's cute. In fact, the whole

getup's kind of cute. The monkey

suit's a nice touch, honey puss.

TED

This has to be a mistake. Is this

room 404?

SIGFRIED

Theodore? What do you take me for,

Theodore?

TED

A very upset man?

SIGFRIED

(to Angela)

I am an upset man, Theodore.

TED

How do you know my name, sir?

SIGFRIED

I'm psychic, Theodore.

TED

Look my name is Ted, actually, and I

have no idea what's going on here,

but I've obviously come at a bad

time.

SIGFRIED

Let's not belabor the fact that you

have no sense of timing, Theodore.

The fact is you're here.

SIGFRIED

(continuing)

And I couldn't think of a better

time for you to introduce me to your

beau than on New Year's Eve.

TED

Oh fuck, there's a mistake. You're

fucking wrong here. My name is

Theodore, yes! My mother named me

that and I hate the name. But I'm a

fucking bellhop. People call me Ted.

I work here.

SIGFRIED

Look, I'd love to sit here all night

with you talking about things like

when you broke in your first mitt --

(pause)

That was insensitive of me, wasn't

it, T H E O D O R E? But let's cut

to the chase, okay?

TED

Okay.

SIGFRIED

So apologize!

TED

For what?

SIGFRIED

You are really beginning to annoy

me, Theodore.

TED

Look, obviously you two are working

something out and if I could help

you with your problem I would.

SIGFRIED

What are you saying? Are you saying

I got a problem? Are you trying to

say I don't give her what she needs?

That I'm FUCKING INSENSITIVE!!

TED

Look, is this about another man? Or

something?

SIGFRIED

Let's get our ABC's right, here,

Theodore. Theodore, right?

TED

Ted's better.

SIGFRIED

Ted, okay... Are you saying my wife

cheats on me?

TED

I didn't say that... I...

SIGFRIED

Oh, for Christ's sake, Theodore,

this is about as intimate a situation

as you can get, you, me, and Angela

here. It's pretty cozy. To say nothing

of how stupid an idea it is to lie

to a man with a loaded gun without

considering the possible response. I

demand an apology!

SIGFRIED

Don't move. I've got to take this.

SIGFRIED

(into phone)

What?

(pause)

We ain't got any needles here, kid.

Just a big fucking gun.

SIGFRIED

(to Ted)

Now, where was I? Oh yeah, I remember.

SIGFRIED

I want you to pray for forgiveness,

Theodore.

SIGFRIED

(continuing)

Now say after me, "I apologize..."

TED

I apologize...

SIGFRIED

For what?

SIGFRIED

For fucking what?

TED

That I said you might have been

unfaithful?

SIGFRIED

"That I said you might have been

unfaithful?" Listen, Theodore, you're

in church here... you're kneeling in

front of an altar. Truth... truth is

all it hears. Say the following, "I,

Theodore, must humbly and sincerely

apologize for saying that you fucked

another man!"

SIGFRIED

(continuing)

Satisfied?

SIGFRIED

(continuing)

Do you accept the fucking apology?

SIGFRIED

(continuing)

You always gotta get the last word,

don't you? It's one way with you,

Angela, isn't it? I give and I give

and I get nothing back.

SIGFRIED

(continuing)

She just sits there waiting for me

to jump through hoops...

SIGFRIED

(continuing)

Stupid me, for a second I thought

you were going to say something...

something like, "I'm sorry." HA!

"I'm sorry." You're absolutely right,

love cakes, I wouldn't want it that

way. That's one thing you can say

about Angela. She'll never do anything

she doesn't want to do. If the feeling

ain't there, she just isn't going to

do it. There is nothing in this world

as fucked as a woman who gives when

she doesn't want to. Never let that

happen to you, Theodore. It makes

you feel very little indeed.

TED

You mind if I...?

SIGFRIED

Go ahead. Spit it out.

TED

I don't mean to upset you further,

sir, but I think she was trying to

say yes.

SIGFRIED

Are you condescending to me, Theodore?

TED

Absolutely not, I would never do

that.

SIGFRIED

Why don't you just say it?

TED

Say what?

SIGFRIED

That you think I'm an idiot.

TED

I would never say that.

SIGFRIED

You think you're superior to me,

don't ya, Theodore? You don't think

I notice there is a gag in the woman's

mouth.

TED

Of course you do.

SIGFRIED

Naturally "of course." And do you

know how I know that?

TED

How, sir?

SIGFRIED

Because I PUT THE GAG IN HER MOUTH!

I'm gonna let you in on a little

secret about communication, Theodore.

It's all in the eyes...

(points the gun at

Ted)

Him?

(turns the gun on

himself)

Or me? Him or me? No one? Okay. Let's

drag it out.

TED

What!

ANGELA

We don't have time to play charades

here, asshole! Untie me quick.

TED

Listen, lady, I don't know what in

the hell is going on here, but I'd

appreciate it if you would explain

to that nutcase that he's making a

big mistake.

ANGELA

Look, whether you like it or not,

you're in the middle of a situation

here you can't just wish your way

out of.

TED

But I've never seen you people before,

we're complete strangers.

ANGELA

Everyone starts out strangers, Ted,

it's where we end up that counts.

Hurry up.

TED

I don't know if I can do this. It's

too hard.

ANGELA

Life is hard, Ted. You ever stopped

to consider how many times you change

your underwear in a lifetime?

ANGELA

I don't mean literally, you ignoramus.

TED

What?

ANGELA

Forget it, listen to me. There's a

gun in my suitcase behind the bed,

it's loaded...

TED

I'm not going to shoot anybody.

ANGELA

Fine. Get the gun and I'll shoot

"anybody."

TED

And make me an accessory in the murder

of your husband?

TED

That's not fair. It just isn't fair.

ANGELA

Get a fucking grip on yourself. First

off, who says he's my husband? And

second, we are a long way from fair

here, fair is back in jolly old

England eatin' crumpets and sipping

on tea.

TED

Tut. Tut. Tut. Not so fast. Well,

maybe there are two sides to this

thing.

ANGELA

There are two sides to a plate, still

you only eat off of one. Now GET THE

GUN!

TED

So why's he got you tied up?

ANGELA

I'm a werewolf, Ted! Get the gun!

ANGELA

Come on, Ted. Come over here just

for a minute. You can do it. Come

on, Ted. You look like a good guy.

ANGELA

That's it, Teddy. You look so much

more attractive when you're self-

assured.

ANGELA

(she panics)

Quick, he's coming back. Put the gag

back in, and remember the gun!

TED

Nine thousand, three hundred and

twenty-two times, to the best of my

estimation.

SIGFRIED

I was just beginning to think I could

trust you, Theodore. Silly me.

TED

I was just trying to help her breathe

a little.

SIGFRIED

Don't let me stop you, Teddy. You

don't mind me calling you Teddy, do

you?

TED

That's fine.

SIGFRIED

I used to have a little bunny rabbit

named Teddy, it looked real cute

nibbling on Angela's ear. Only problem

here is you're no bunny rabbit,

Theodore, and it really fuckin' razzes

me to picture you doin' it. But don't

let me stop you, Teddy... no need to

play sneaky-poo.

TED

Look, man, if this is some kind of

Voodoo thing and you want me to have

sex with your wife, there is

absolutely no way.

SIGFRIED

(shouts at the top of

his lungs)

I said, nibble, asshole! Now!

TED

(whispers)

Sorry, lady.

SIGFRIED

What's the matter, no whiz left in

the cheese? I'm not cramping your

style, am I?

TED

Look, I'm not playing this game

anymore.

SIGFRIED

It's almost all over, Theodore, and

soon you can go home to Mommy.

TED

My name is not Theodore, it's TED,

TED, TED, T... E... D... TED... NOT

TEDDY, NOT THEODORE... TED... Yes,

my mother did me the service of naming

me Theodore and I haven't a clue as

to how you know that because everyone

who knows that lives a long way away

from here. Do you have any idea what

it's like to go to school where all

the other kids' parents are in jail

doing time for crimes like grand

larceny, aggravated assault, burglary

and murder, and you get stuck with a

mother who names you Theodore and

dressed you up in little matching

pink outfits with, get this, a little

blue bow fucking tie! Well, I'll

tell you what happens. Pretty soon

Theodore becomes "Theo the Thumper,"

and when Theo the Thumper gets old

enough, he packs his bags and goes

thousands of miles away where he can

put the whole bloody mess behind

him. So, if you don't mind, shoot me

now, because no one is going to call

me that again. My name is Ted, okay?

Got it? TED!

SIGFRIED

Sigfried.

TED

What?

SIGFRIED

My name is Sigfried.

TED

Sigfried?

SIGFRIED

Yah, Sigfried.

TED

Nice to meet you, Sigfried.

SIGFRIED

Very impressive, Ted. "Theo the

Thumper?"... Ouch. It's a deal, kid.

Ted it will be.

TED

Thanks.

TED

You okay, mister? I'll get help!

TED

(continuing)

That's the wrong door, sir.

SIGFRIED

Get me the nitro... it's in the

bathroom cabinet. Now!

CUT TO:

SIGFRIED (O.S.)

(shouting in the

distance)

It's no time to take a leak, Teddy,

I'm fucking dying here!

TED

Hi...

TED

Listen, I'm stuck here in a situation

that I can't even begin to explain,

but would you be so kind as to get

help? Could you call the police,

please?

TED

(continuing)

You okay?

CUT TO:

TED

Sigfried?

ANGELA

Where's the fucking nitro?

TED

I couldn't find it!

ANGELA

You took long enough. Untie me, for

Christ's sake, you fucking upset him

and he's dying.

TED

I thought you wanted to kill him.

ANGELA

You'd make a great cop, Theodore.

TED

I can't handle this alone, I'd better

get help.

SIGFRIED

I tie a pretty good knot, don't I,

Ted?

TED

Thank God you're okay...

SIGFRIED

Never felt better.

ANGELA

You bastard!

SIGFRIED

(to Angela)

Come on, honey, don't get mad. It

was just a little test, and I'm glad

I did it because now I'll know forever

that you really do love me. Truly

and deeply.

ANGELA

If the simple fact that I didn't

want your bloated, dead body lying

out on the floor is love, then no

wonder we find ourselves as we are

at this very fucking moment.

SIGFRIED

Oh, no. I heard you and there was

genuine care in that voice. Can't be

denied. Can it, Ted?

TED

I think you're right and, if you

just keep this kind of open dialogue

going, you'll go a long way to

resolving this misunderstanding.

TED

(continuing)

You'd be surprised what happens when

people just listen to each other

without succumbing to all that pain

and anger.

ANGELA

You heard shit, monkey boy. Easy for

you to say after you fuck another

man's wife. You should at least have

the guts to stand by your convictions.

TED

That's a lie, Sigfried. I swear to

God.

ANGELA

When I think of all the times you

were inside me promising me a better

life, it makes me want to puke.

TED

Why are you doing this? What have I

ever done to you people?

ANGELA

What didn't you do, stick man?

Unfortunately, you don't have the

balls to back up the actions of your

huge cock.

SIGFRIED

(whimpering)

He's got a huge cock?

TED

She's lying again, mister. It's not

that big.

SIGFRIED

Show it to me.

TED

Come on, man, she's lying. Can't you

see she's fucking with you?

ANGELA

Put it this way, God made up for

what he did to Gumby with Ted here.

SIGFRIED

Show it to me.

ANGELA

Show him your cock, Theodore.

SIGFRIED

Stop talking about his cock, will

you?!

ANGELA

It's hard to stop talking about

something so huge. I could go on and

on about his cock, bone, nob, bishop,

wang, thang, hotrod. Hump mobile,

Oscar, dong, dagger, banana, cucumber,

salami. Sausage, kielbasa, schlong,

dink, tool, Big Ben, Mister Happy,

prick, disk, pecker, peter, pee-pee,

wee-wee, weiner, pisser, pistol,

joint, hose, horn, middle-leg, third-

leg, meat, stick, joystick, dipstick.

ANGELA

(continuing)

Junior, the little head, little guy,

Rumple Foreskin, Tootsie Roll. Snake,

one-eyed monster, one-eyed wonder,

shaft, sword, meat whistle, skin

flute, love muscle, Roto-Rooter,

instrument, banger, rammer, ramrod,

cherrypicker, log, pole.

SIGFRIED

Please, don't leave me. I'll call

you Ted from now on.

TED

It's not me, mister, I swear.

SIGFRIED

Personally, I don't give a fuck,

Ted, it's just I don't want to be

alone right now. I'm feeling a little

vulnerable.

SIGFRIED

(continuing)

No guns, okay? Just you and me, Ted.

You know my father used to say that

forgiveness is the only thing that

evil can't sink its teeth into.

TED

That's beautiful.

SIGFRIED

Kind of nice down here on the floor,

isn't it, Ted?

TED

Yes, actually.

SIGFRIED

Things take on a whole new

perspective... You'd like my trust,

wouldn't you, Ted?

TED

Yes I would.

SIGFRIED

I just got one thing to ask you and

I'll let you go.

TED

Okay. Okay.

SIGFRIED

Tell me straight now.

TED

What?

SIGFRIED

What was it like?

TED

What was what like?

SIGFRIED

You know, you and her.

TED

Oh, for fuck sake, Sigfried, what do

you want me to say?

SIGFRIED

Either way you're fucked, right? You

ever gonna see her again, Theodore?

TED

If I ever saw her again, I'd run the

other way.

SIGFRIED

Promise?

TED

I promise.

SIGFRIED

You're lying, but I can respect that,

Ted. If you told me, it would no

longer be a secret, and secrets have

a power, kid. You open that box and

they disappear forever. A bad secret

will rip you apart, but the good one

are all you got. In the end, when

all the people you knew are dead and

gone, all you'll have left are you

secrets. And when you die, the box

is open and it all blows away --

dust to dust -- all the anger,

jealousy, desire and love just blow

away.

SIGFRIED

(continuing)

So you know what I say, let's call

it a truce, kiddo.

SIGFRIED

(continuing)

I'm a man of love, Theodore. Love is

all I live for.

TED

I can see that.

SIGFRIED

Maybe to a fault.

TED

Don't beat yourself up over it.

SIGFRIED

That's nice of you to say, Ted, but

I probably should make a clean break

of it, cut her loose and get my own

place. I just can't imagine living

without her. Do you think I should

seek professional help?

TED

It's not for everyone, but maybe in

your case it could help.

SIGFRIED

You ever been out on the ocean at

night?

SIGFRIED

(continuing)

I have... scary as a motherfucker,

all that darkness around you. It's

like a big black carpet rolled out

as far as the eye can see. Sometimes,

if you're lucky, you'll see a light.

It could be as small as a little

spark, but it will cut a path straight

through all that blackness, straight

to you. It could be another boat, or

some distant fire on an island, but

that light will shed a shining path

of diamonds cutting through mile

after mile of darkness to lie at

your feet. That's love, Ted, it's

like a path of light in an ocean of

darkness.

ANGELA

(to Ted)

You'd better go check to see if I

killed anybody downstairs.

TED

You people gonna be okay?

ANGELA

We're fine, Ted.

TED

Would you like me to...?

ANGELA

Another time, Ted.

CUT TO:

YOUNG GUY

Happy New Year, buddy.

TED

Happy New Year.

YOUNG GUY

I was just in room 404, what a party!

You know where room 409 is at?

TED

Beats me. It's somewhere around here.

TED

(continuing)

Hey, what's your name?

ROOM 716

"THE MISBEHAVERS"

TED

Front desk.

CUT TO:

MAN

Bottle of Moet et Chandon. Fast.

MAN

Give me that...

MAN

There... see? You look cool with

your hair up like this. Like me...

MAN

Not down and to the side, all stupid

like your mom likes to comb it.

MAN

You've got your mother's hair.

MAN

I can't do anything with it.

MAN

There. Go.

WIFE

(putting a plastic

clip in Sarah's hair)

There. Go.

WIFE

(mocking)

So, are we gonna have fun tonight?

WIFE

I didn't think so.

MAN

Hey.

MAN

(shrugs)

Let's just leave the kids here.

WIFE

Here in the room? By themselves?

MAN

No... with the television.

MAN

You want to have fun tonight, don't

you?

WIFE

Yes.

MAN

They'll be fine.

MAN

Hey.

MAN

You guys are going to stay here and

watch TV.

MAN

I want you to be in bed asleep before

twelve. Your mother and I will be

back later on.

MAN

Okay?

MAN

Don't misbehave.

SARAH

Why did we have to get all dressed

up if we weren't going with them?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SARAH

What are you doing?

JUANCHO

Escaping. Stinks in here, anyway.

MAN

(stern)

What did I say?

MAN

Behave.

JUANCHO

Yes, Papa.

TED

The champagne you ordered, sir.

MAN

No time for this. Leave it on ice.

WIFE

But I want some now...

MAN

There'll be plenty for you and the

party, baby, you can bomb yourself

all you want at the party.

WIFE

What a waste.

MAN

(to Ted)

Hey.

MAN

You want five hundred bucks?

TED

Sure!

MAN

How about three?

TED

Three hundred?

MAN

Yeah.

TED

Three's good.

MAN

My children are staying here tonight

watching TV. I want you to check up

on them every thirty minutes.

TED

Check up on 'em?

MAN

Make sure they're all right, make

sure they're fed, make sure they go

to bed.

TED

We can call out and hire a babysitter.

MAN

I don't trust babysitters. My children

are safer alone than with some fucked-

up pedophile babysitter I don't know

from the man in the fucking moon.

WIFE

What about him? What makes you think

you can trust him?

MAN

Tell me that's not a face you can

trust.

TED

Look, sir, I'd like to help you out,

but I really can't. I'm all alone

here tonight.

MAN

One hundred... two hundred... three

hundred...

TED

I thought you said five hundred.

MAN

I said three hundred.

TED

No, you distinctly said five hundred.

MAN

You calling me a liar?

TED

No, I'm not saying you're lying. I'm

saying you accidentally forgot that

what you first said was five hundred.

MAN

I don't do anything accidentally,

jerk. I might've first said five

hundred, but what I last said was

three hundred, and what you say last

is what counts.

TED

Well then, if you say five hundred

one last time, we got a deal.

MAN

You fuckin' with me, Pendejo?

TED

No, not at all. It's New Year's Eve

and I'm here alone. If there was

somebody else here, no problem, but

I'm by myself. And looking after

your kids is a pain in the ass I

don't need --

MAN

You callin' my kids a pain in the

ass?

TED

-- No, they're not a pain in the

ass, it's the situation that's a

pain in the ass.

MAN

No, you were right the first time.

You win, tough guy, five hundred.

WIFE

(disgusted)

You kids are getting expensive.

MAN

(looking at name tag)

What's your name? Ted?

TED

Yeah. It's Ted.

MAN

(to the children)

His name is Ted. If you need anything,

dial 0 and ask for Ted.

MAN

(deadly whisper)

If something happens to my children,

I wouldn't want to be you.

WIFE

Make sure they're in bed before

midnight.

TED

(thinking)

Before midnight? Then should I wake

them up for the countdown to the New

Year?

WIFE

No...

MAN

Don't misbehave.

TED

Okay. These are the rules. Don't

break the rules and I won't break

your necks.

TED

(smiling)

I always wanted to say that. Someone

said that to me when I was a kid.

TED

Except they were joking. I'm not.

TED

The rules are simple. Don't do

anything you wouldn't do if your

parents were here. If there's an

emergency, call me on the phone,

like your dad said.

SARAH

That's not what he said.

SARAH

He said to call if we need anything.

TED

Well, I've got a lot of work to do

and I can't have you calling me every

time you want a drink of water, so

please limit your calls to emergencies

only.

SARAH

We paid you five hundred dollars.

We'll call you if we need anything.

You don't want to upset my dad.

TED

Okay. Please. Try to call only when

necessary. Watch TV, and if you're

good, I'll bring up some milk and

cookies. Bye.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SARAH

Your feet stink.

JUANCHO

They don't stink.

JUANCHO

Check it out. T & A.

SARAH

Change it. You're not supposed to

watch this.

JUANCHO

We're supposed to watch TV.

SARAH

Not this kind of TV. Change it.

CUT TO:

TED

Front desk.

SARAH

Ted? Hi. It's me, Sarah. You're our

sitter for tonight.

TED

Oh, Jesus, what did I tell you? I

said if you don't bother me, you'll

get milk and cookies. Now, do you

want them or do you not?

SARAH

I want you to turn off the Nudie

station in our room.

TED

(reading stats on

room 716)

I can't turn on an adult station

without permission from your parents.

SARAH

No.

(struggling with winter

tights)

Not turn it on, turn it off. It's

already on.

TED

That's not what the machine tells

me.

SARAH

Well, stop listening to the machine

and listen to me. There's naked ladies

dancing on my TV and I want 'em off.

TED

If you're good, you'll get milk and

cookies, so leave me alone, please.

I'll be up later to put you both to

sleep.

SARAH

Change the channel, now!

JUANCHO

Man, you're the one with the stinky

feet.

SARAH

They don't stink.

JUANCHO

Yeah, they do.

SARAH

Here, smell for yourself.

SARAH

Go ahead.

JUANCHO

(holding up the bottle)

Hey, get a bottle opener!

SARAH

Don't shake it!

(into phone)

Ted? Hi. It's me. Sarah.

TED

Yeah. Who died? No one? Then don't

call me.

SARAH

I thought I'd tell you that your

cleaning ladies are doing a bum job.

There's all kinds of leftover stuff

around here.

SARAH

Needles and things. We're not supposed

to have needles here, are we? I mean,

they don't come with the room, do

they? Send someone up here to clean

this place up right.

SARAH

(to Juancho)

I TOLD YOU NOT TO SHAKE IT!

(to Ted)

I gotta go. My brother just exploded

the champagne all over the room. Oh,

and bring us a couple of toothbrushes.

There's a card in the bathroom that

says you'll bring free toothbrushes

if we ask for them.

SARAH

I'm calling another room, give me

three numbers.

JUANCHO

4-0-9.

SARAH

Hello? Hi. You don't know me, and I

don't know you, but... do you have

any needles? We've got needles here

and I was wondering if they come

with the room or not. Don't have

any? Thanks. Just checking.

SARAH

(pointing out the

rules)

The center is the bull's eye, 100

points, this one's 10 points, this

one's 20 points.

SARAH

Hey, wait a minute. Let me get out

of the way!

TED

I brought you some milk and cookies.

If you want some you have to eat

them now, because you're going to

sleep.

SARAH

We're going to sleep now?

TED

Your parents said put you to bed

before midnight. Well, it's before

midnight. Maybe that way you'll leave

me alone.

SARAH

Those aren't milk and cookies.

TED

We were out of cookies, so I brought

you milk and Saltines. Don't complain!

Now hurry up and eat. You're going

to bed right now.

JUANCHO

These are old.

SARAH

They're stale.

TED

(impatient)

Dip 'em in the milk! The milk will

make them soft.

TED

No crackers? Okay, fine. Sleepy time.

Now, I don't want you guys wandering

around, so if you need to go to the

restroom, go now.

JUANCHO

What about our pajamas?

TED

You wanna look nice in case there's

an earthquake, don'tcha?

TED

Okay. Then stay in those clothes.

SARAH

What's that?

TED

Oh, this is just some Mentholatum

ointment. Come on, under the covers.

Close your eyes and I'll tell you a

story.

TED

Your dad says he doesn't trust

babysitters. I don't blame him. You

know what my babysitter did to me

once?

(confiding)

I never told my parents, either.

TED

I hated going to sleep. You know,

it's nighttime and you wanna run

around and act crazy. So what my

babysitter did to make sure I'd go

to sleep and not be tempted to get

up, was, she'd take some of this

vapor rub stuff... Can you smell

this?

TED

Well, she'd just dab a little of

this over each eyelid, so that I

would be sure and keep my eyes closed

all night.

TED

There. Now you've got some, too!

Don't open your eyes or it'll burrrn,

burn, burn. The smell helps clear

your sinuses too, so it's doing double

duty.

JUANCHO

What happens when it's morning?

TED

If you keep your eyes closed all

night, it will wear off by morning.

But DON'T OPEN YOUR EYES BEFORE

THAT...

SARAH

Did you ever open your eyes?

TED

Yes... I did.

TED

And now look at me.

CHILDREN

(in unison)

We can't.

TED

Good. You'll do just fine. Sleep

well and I won't tell your parents

about the champagne.

CUT TO:

JUANCHO

Are you watching TV?

SARAH

Yep. If you wanna watch too, you

have to go wash your face.

SARAH

Be careful...

CUT TO:

SARAH

Ted!

TED

What do you want now, for Christ's

sake! Who died?

SARAH

(near tears)

I don't know, but she's in my bed!

TED

What?

SARAH

There's a dead body in my bed!

TED

That's just your brother. Sound

asleep.

SARAH

No, there's a woman's dead body inside

the bed, in the mattress.

TED

You saw the body?

SARAH

Yes!

TED

Impossible. You've got ointment on

your eyes! You can't see shit! Now

go to sleep!

TED

Godammit, go to sleep!

SARAH

(crying now)

I washed it off...

TED

You washed off the ointment?

SARAH

(pissed, drunk)

Yeah, didn't you ever think to do

that?

SARAH

(through cigarette)

You never tried it, did you? Then

you agree I'm smarter than you...

TED

All right. Now you listen to me...

SARAH

Get your ass up here and call the

police, because there's a dead body

in my bed and it smells like shit

and it looks even worse, and if you

don't help us, my dad is gonna lay

you down right next to her, I swear

to fucking God!

JUANCHO

Go, sis.

TED

(incensed)

I'm coming up and if there isn't a

dead body by the time I get there,

I'll make one myself. You!

TED

Oh shit!

CUT TO:

TED

What the fuck is going on??!!

TED

Your parents are on their way up and

I'm not taking responsibility for

this mess!

SARAH

Check under the mattress!

TED

For what?

SARAH

(crying)

For the body, can't you smell it?

TED

It's your feet!

TED

(gurgles through vomit-

spewing lips)

Jesus fucking Christ! What the fuck

is this?

TED

(into the phone)

Police, it's an emergency!

(pause)

Hello, Police, this is the Mon Signor

Hotel, get someone up here right

fucking now, there's a DEAD WHORE

stuffed under the mattress!

SARAH

Don't call her that...

TED

(into the phone)

I'm dead fucking serious, there's a

dead fucking Whore stuffed in the

bedsprings of the fucking bed!

SARAH

Stop calling her that!!

TED

FUCK!!

TED

Jesus!!

CUT OUTSIDE TO:

BACK TO:

MAN

Did they misbehave?

FOUR ROOMS

GUINNESS GIRL

Happy New Year!

TED

Let me speak to Betty.

GUINNESS GIRL

Party's over, she probably went home.

TED

She lives there.

GUINNESS GIRL

Oh, well, I haven't seen 'em in a

while.

TED

Do you even know who I'm talking

about?

GUINNESS GIRL

Yeah... yeah... yeah... I know 'em,

I know Eddy.

TED

Betty, not Eddy.

GUINNESS GIRL

Yeah... yeah... I know Betty too...

Tall...

TED

No, not particularly. She's got curly

red hair.

GUINNESS GIRL

No, no, no, no, no, I know, I know.

Japanese girl.

TED

She's not Japanese! I just said she

had red hair.

GUINNESS GIRL

Yeah... yeah... yeah... I know her.

TED

Well, then get her on the phone,

it's an emergency.

GUINNESS GIRL

Who -- who should I say's calling?

TED

Tell 'em Teddy from work's on the

phone, and it's a major fuckin'

emergency.

GUINNESS GIRL

Gotcha, Betty from work.

TED

Not Betty from work, I'm calling

Betty! I'm Teddy. Just say Ted.

GUINNESS GIRL

Hi, Ted, I'm Margaret. You sound

down. Has this not been the happiest

of New Year's?

TED

(resigning himself to

talking with Margaret)

No Margaret, this hasn't been my

best New Year. This year's starting

off pretty badly.

MARGARET

Awww, how come?

TED

Well, Betty -- the chick whose house

you're at, even though you don't

know her -- leaves me here all by

myself on New Year's Eve. And first

thing right off the bat, I'm fucked

by a coven of witches.

MARGARET

An oven full of witches fucked you?

Is that like at the circus when they

stick all those clowns in an itty-

bitty car?

TED

A coven. A coven of witches. Well,

one witch in particular.

MARGARET

Was she an old hag with a mole, with

hair growing out of it?

TED

No-no-no, she was... quite beautiful.

MARGARET

Ted?

TED

Yes.

MARGARET

What's the problem?

TED

Well, admittedly, that was the best

part of the night. It was pretty

fuckin' cool, actually. But it was

still an unnerving way to start off

the night.

MARGARET

Sounds to me like a pretty great way

to start off the night.

TED

Okay, let's just skip over the

witches.

MARGARET

-- Skipping over the witches.

TED

So, later, in another room, some

crazy sucking maniac sticks a gun in

my face and forces me to play out

some psychosexual drama with his

wife.

MARGARET

He made you have psycho sex with his

wife?

TED

No, he didn't make me fuck his wife,

he thought I'd fucked his wife! He

held me at gunpoint with a loaded

gun!

MARGARET

What kinda gun?

TED

I don't know, I'm not a gun guy. It

was big.

MARGARET

Like Dirty Harry's gun.

TED

Yeah, something like that.

MARGARET

Did it have a real long barrel or a

short barrel?

TED

What difference does it make?

MARGARET

Well, for one thing it's the

difference between a .44 Magnum and

a Magnum .357.

TED

Who cares if it was a .44 or a .392,

it was a fuckin' loaded gun, pointed

at my fuckin' head!

MARGARET

You wanna skip over this part, too?

TED

I want you to get Betty on the phone!

MARGARET

Hold on.

(yelling to the room)

Anybody live here named...

(to Ted)

What's her name again?

TED

Betty.

MARGARET

Betty!

BETTY

Yeah, whatcha screamin' about?

MARGARET

You're Betty?

BETTY

Yeah, I'm Betty, it's my fuckin'

place, who the fuck are you?

MARGARET

I'm Margaret

(hands her the phone)

And this is Ted.

BETTY

Ted, what's the problem?

TED

What's the problem? I don't got a

problem, I got fuckin' problems!

Wanna hear?

BETTY

(yawning, wiping sleep

from her eyes)

Sure.

TED

Well, most recently, there's room

716. There's a scary Mexican gangster

dude pokin' his finger in my chest.

There's his hooligan kids snapping

their fingers at me. There's the

putrid rotting corpse of a dead whore

stuffed in the springs of a bed.

There're rooms blazing afire...

There's a needle from God knows where

stuck in my leg, infecting me with

God knows what, and finally, there's

me walking out the fuckin' door right

now! Buenas noches.

BETTY

(suddenly alert)

Is that the penthouse?

TED

Yeah.

BETTY

That's the Chester Rush party, they

want something.

TED

Yeah, well, tough titty. They're

just gonna have to wait, 'cause I'm

out the door.

BETTY

(panicking)

Now, Ted, wait a minute. I know you're

freaked, I know you're stressed.

You've had a real bad night --

TED

Yes, Betty, I've had-a-real-bad-night --

BETTY

-- You say there's a dead body in a

room?

TED

Yes, I did.

BETTY

No problem, this is a hotel, we've

had dead bodies before, it's just

the price of doing business. You

said the hotel was on fire. Is it

still on fire?

TED

No, it's out.

BETTY

Good, sprinkler system worked like a

charm. Now, you wanna leave, you've

had enough. Perfectly understandable.

I'll take care of everything else.

The only thing I ask is that you

take care of Chester Rush. Then you

can leave.

TED

Now, look --

BETTY

Ted, he's a very important guest of

this hotel. In fact, he is the most

important guest at the hotel. The

Mon Signor used to be a haven for

movie stars. Through the thirties

and forties, and the first half of

the fifties, more movie stars -- if

you break it down on a night-by-night

basis -- stayed at the Mon Signor

than any other hotel in Hollywood.

Now, we had some hard time in the

eighties, even though we were the

official hotel of Cannon Pictures,

but we're coming back strong in the

nineties. And a movie star clientele

is important to that comeback. If we

can keep stars of his magnitude happy,

we're on our way. So, Ted, just take

care of him, then you can leave.

TED

Look, I don't feel like --

BETTY

He probably just wants some champagne!

You can do that, can't you? Please

just take care of him, the entire

staff of the Mon Signor is begging

you!

TED

Okay. But get your ass here pronto.

BETTY

You're a good man, Ted. Thanks.

TED

Hello, Mr. Rush. Sorry for the delay.

How can I help you?

THE PENTHOUSE

"THE MAN FROM HOLLYWOOD"

ANGELA

Hi, Theodore.

TED

What the hell are you doing here?

ANGELA

Having a drink.

TED

Is that crazy husband of yours in

there?

ANGELA

Are you kidding, he'll be asleep

till Christmas.

VOICE (O.S.)

Entrez, entrez.

CHESTER

(still sitting)

Entrez, entrez, come in, come in.

TED

(wheeling in the tray)

Hi, sorry I took so long, but I got

everything you asked for --

CHESTER

-- Not a problem, my friend Mr.

Bellboy.

ANGELA

(closing the door)

His name's Theodore.

TED

Actually, it's not Theodore,

(he throws a look at

Angela)

It's Ted.

CHESTER

So, Ted the Bellboy, as I was saying --

would you care for some champagne?

That's not what I was saying, but

would you care for some champagne?

TED

No, thank you.

CHESTER

Ya sure? Cristal. It's the best. I

never liked champagne before I had

Cristal, now I love it.

TED

Okay, yeah, sure.

CHESTER

-- As I was saying, Ted, don't worry

about being late. For our purposes,

promptness is far behind thoroughness.

CHESTER

Chin-chin.

CHESTER

Whadya say, Ted?

TED

Thank you?

CHESTER

No, not thank you. Whadya say about

the tasty beverage?

TED

It's good.

CHESTER

Fuckin' good, Ted. It's fuckin' good.

Let's try it again, shall we? So,

Ted, whadya think about the beverage.

TED

It's fuckin' good.

CHESTER

You bet your sweet bippy, Ted. It's

fuckin' Cristal, everything else is

piss.

NORMAN

Bellboy! Bellboy! Bellboy!

CHESTER

(to Norman)

Knock it off, you're making my friend

Ted here uneasy.

(to Ted)

Pay no attention to Norman here,

Ted, he's just fuckin' wit' ya, that's

all. That's from Quadrophenia. Now

me, myself, when I think of bellboys

I think of -- "bellboy" isn't an

insult, is it? Is there another name

for what you do that I'm ignorant

of? Bellman, bellperson --

TED

Bellboy's fine.

CHESTER

Good. I'm glad they haven't changed

that. There's a friendliness to

"bellboy." As I was saying, Ted,

when Norman thinks of bellboys, he

thinks of Quadrophenia.

TED

No.

CHESTER

You should, it's one of Jerry's better

movies. He never says a word through

the entire film. A completely silent

performance. How many actors can

pull that off? And he has to go to

France to get respect. That says it

all about America right there. The

minute Jerry Lewis dies, every paper

in this fuckin' country gonna write

articles calling the man a genius.

It's not right. It's not right and

it's not fair. But why should that

surprise anybody? When has America

ever been fair? We might be right

every once in a while, but we're

very rarely fair.

TED

Where do you want this?

CHESTER

You in a hurry, Ted?

TED

(he is, but doesn't

want to rush the

movie star)

No, not particularly.

CHESTER

Good, then stop playing "Beat the

Clock." Now let me introduce you to

everybody.

CHESTER

Our friend from downstairs you already

seem to be acquainted with.

ANGELA

Oh, me and Theodore go way back.

Don't we, Theodore?

TED

The name's Ted, Angela. I only let

people with loaded guns at my head

call me Theodore.

CHESTER

Angela's like you, Ted, a newfound

friend.

ANGELA

We met at the pool.

CHESTER

(to Ted)

Have you ever seen Angela in a one-

piece?

TED

No.

CHESTER

Well, it's somethin' to see.

(arm around Ted)

The Man sitting in the chair, with

the bottle of Jim Bean in his hand

and the sense of humor, is Norman.

Norman, say hello to Ted.

NORMAN

What's up?

CHESTER

The sociable son of a bitch on the

telephone is Leo. And the person on

the other end of the phone is his

lovely wife Ellen.

(to Leo)

Leo, say hello to Ted.

LEO

Hi, Ted, glad you could make it.

(back to phone)

What?

(pause)

What does punctuality have to do

with love?

CHESTER

Which brings me to me, Chester Rush,

Ted. Pleased to meetcha.

TED

I know. I'm sorry I haven't seen

your movie.

CHESTER

It's quite all right, Ted, nothing

to feel sorry about. That's why God

invented video. But you know, Ted, a

lot of people did see it.

CHESTER

Who drank out of this bottle last?

CHESTER

Who drank out of this bottle -- not

the other bottles -- this bottle

last?

NORMAN

What's wrong, Chester?

CHESTER

It's fuckin' flat, Norman, that's

what's wrong. The champagne -- the

fuckin' Cristal's fuckin' flat.

CHESTER

I was saying, Ted, a lot of people

did see it. And not just on video,

either. Leo, what was the final take

on domestic?

LEO

72.1 million.

(worried tone)

You okay, champ?

CHESTER

(struggling with bottle)

I'm cool, so talk to your wife.

CHESTER

(to Ted)

72.1 million dollars. That's before

video and before foreign, and before

pay-TV and before free TV. We're

talking fuckin' asses in fuckin'

seats.

(he pops the cork)

Before all that other shit, The Wacky

Detective made 72.1 million dollars.

CHESTER

And my new one, The Dog Catcher,

it's projected to break a hundred.

(he clinks Ted's glass

with his)

The Dog Catcher.

TED

The Dog Catcher.

CHESTER

Now let's stroll over here and see

what goodies you brought us.

TED

Do you mind me asking what's all

this stuff for?

CHESTER

One thing at a time, Ted. I'm not a

frog and you're not a bunny, so let's

not jump ahead. C'mon, Norman, you

should be interested in this.

NORMAN

Damn Skippy!

(pause)

Tell it.

TED

A block of wood.

CHESTER

Good.

TED

Three nails.

NORMAN

Why three nails?

CHESTER

That's how many Peter Lorre asked

for. Continue, Ted.

TED

A roll of twine.

CHESTER

That's definitely a roll of twine.

Continue.

TED

A bucket of ice.

CHESTER

(to Norman)

You into it?

NORMAN

(to Chester)

I'm into it.

CHESTER

(to Ted)

Go on.

TED

A donut.

CHESTER

That's for me. Continue.

TED

And a hatchet.

CHESTER

A hatchet as sharp as the devil

himself is what I asked for.

TED

Well, you be the judge.

NORMAN

I'll be the judge.

CHESTER

Whadya think?

NORMAN

That's a sharp motherfucker. Bring

all this bullshit over to the bar.

CHESTER

You heard him, Ted.

LEO

Bitch!

NORMAN

You still married?

LEO

Maybe, maybe not, but I don't give a

flyin' fuck either way. I've had it

with that Machiavellian bitch! I'm

too drunk to drive home. I'm sorry

about that, I'm real sorry about

that. I got drunk on New Year's Eve,

cut my fuckin' head off...

(noticing Ted at the

bar)

What's going on here?

CHESTER

We now return you to The Man from

Rio, already in progress.

LEO

(surprised)

Noooo, you're gonna do it?

NORMAN

Looks like.

LEO

You guys ain't bullshittin', you're

gonna really go for it?

ANGELA

After talkin' about it all night,

they better. I wanna see a show.

CHESTER

When we do it, you'll have something

to see.

LEO

You are one radical dude.

TED

Well, that's everything, so if you

don't need me for anything else,

I'll go back downstairs.

CHESTER

Not so fast, Ted. We ain't quite

done yet. Why don't you take a seat

at the bar, get comfortable, and

have an open mind when we explain

the festivities of the evening to

you.

TED

Look, guys, you paid for the room.

As long as you don't break up the

furniture, you can do whatever the

fuck you want. And me personally, I

don't care if you break up the

furniture. You don't have to explain

anything to me. Whatever constitutes

a good time as far as you guys are

concerned is your business.

CHESTER

Well, it's your business, Ted. 'Cause

we want you to take part.

TED

Take part in what?

LEO

Chester, your way of breaking the

news to him gently is scarin' the

shit outta him.

ANGELA

Look at the poor guy. Just spit it

out.

CHESTER

First off, let me say that there's

nothing homosexual about what we're

going to ask you to do. There's

nothing sexual at all about what we

want. But I was thinkin' you might

be thinkin' we want you to do some

sex thing. Pee on us, suck us off,

shit like that. Let me assure you

nothing could be farther from what

we want --

ANGELA

Can I jump in here?

CHESTER

No, you can't jump in here, this is

my story.

ANGELA

Theodore's been here fifteen minutes

and you've talked about everything

but.

CHESTER

Hey, if you don't like it, you can

get the fuck out.

LEO

If it'll please the court, let me

explain to Ted our intentions.

NORMAN

(yelling)

I second the nomination!

CHESTER

(yelling)

Move the nomination be closed!

CHESTER

(calmly)

Leo, the floor is yours.

LEO

Thank you.

(to Ted)

Ted, did you ever watch the old

"Alfred Hitchcock Show"?

TED

(totally bewildered

at this point)

Yeah.

LEO

Did you ever see the episode The Man

from Rio, with Peter Lorre and Steve

McQueen?

TED

I don't think so.

LEO

Oh, you'd remember it all right. In

the show, Peter Lorre makes a bet

that Steve McQueen can't light his

cigarette lighter ten times in a

row. Now if Steve McQueen can light

his cigarette lighter ten times in a

row, he wins Peter Lorre's new car.

If he can't he loses his little

finger.

(pause)

Norman and Chester just made the

same bet.

(pause)

Norman's putting up his pinky against

Chester's mint convertible, 1964 red

convertible Chevy Corvelle that he

can light his Zippo ten times in a

row.

TED

You guys are drunk.

CHESTER

Well, that goes without saying, but

that doesn't mean we don't know what

we're doing.

NORMAN

I'll tell ya what I'm doin'.

NORMAN

I drive a motherfuckin' Honda my

sister sold me. You hear what I'm

sayin'? A little white motherfuckin'

Honda Civic.

(he holds up the

magazine)

You see this shit?!

(reading the magazine)

"Hollywood's hottest new star, next

to America's hottest old car."

(he hands Ted the

magazine)

Now you take a good look at that

machine that this motherfucker over

here is standing next to. That's a

1964 nigger-red, rag-top Chevy

Corvelle. And I love that car more'n

I love hips, lips, and fingertips.

Cut to we sittin' here celebrating,

gettin' high, drinkin' champagne --

CHESTER

-- Cristal. When you're drinkin'

anything else, you're drinking

champagne. When you're drinkin'

Cristal, you say you're drinkin'

Cristal.

NORMAN

-- drinkin' Cristal. Watchin' TV.

"Rockin' New Year's Eve." When all

of a sudden we flip on Steve McQueen

and Peter Lorre bein' fuckin' badass.

And I look at this funny motherfucker

over here, and I say, "I'd do that

for the Chevelle."

LEO

And Chester replies...

CHESTER

"...Oh, really?"

TED

You guys wouldn't be doin' something

this stupid unless you were drunk.

NORMAN

I think that pretty much goes without

sayin'. We'd probably chicken out.

But when you're fucked-up, you don't

lie. You tell the fuckin' truth. And

the fuckin' truth is, my lucky Zippo's

gonna win me Chester's car.

TED

(to Chester)

Why are you doing this?

CHESTER

Thrill of the bet. I'm the one with

something to lose here. 'Cause I can

pretty near guarantee that I love my

car more'n Norman loves his pinky.

TED

(to Leo)

How 'bout you guys, you're just gonna

sit back and let your friends mutilate

each other?

LEO

Why not? Life don't get much more

exciting than this. I mean if Norman

was puttin' his dick on the choppin'

block, I'd step in, 'cause, ya know

in the morning, we'd really regret

that. But his pinky? Who gives a

fuck? I mean theoretically, he could

lose that choppin' onions tomorrow.

Life still goes on.

TED

(to Angela)

How 'bout you?

ANGELA

(to Ted)

I don't care.

CHESTER

Which brings us to your part in this

little wager.

TED

I don't have a part.

CHESTER

Now, Ted, my old granddaddy used ta

say: "The less a man makes declarative

statements, the less he's apt to

look foolish in retrospect." Now

there're some inherent obstacles in

this undertaking. First of all, I'm

not some sick fuck like Peter Lorre

on that show, travelin' the

countryside collecting fingers. We're

all buddies, here. Nobody wants Norman

to lose his finger. We just wanna

chop it off. So if fate doesn't smile

on ol' Norman, we'll put his finger

on ice and rush 'im to a hospital,

where in all likelihood be able to

sew it back on.

TED

Hopefully.

LEO

Eighty percent.

NORMAN

Our side.

CHESTER

So Norman's protected. His interests

have been looked after. My interests,

on the other hand, have not. I am as

emotionally attached to my car as

Norman is physically to his finger.

I'm putting up a very expensive piece

of machinery on this wager. Now, if

I lose, I lose, I have no problem

with that. I'm a big boy, I knew

what I was doing. However, if I win,

I wanna win. If Norman lights his

lighter ten times in a row, he's

gonna have no emotional problems

about taking my car keys whatsoever.

But if I win, it's not inconceivable

that Leo or myself, at the last

minute, might not be able to wield

the ax. Which brings us full circle

to you, Ted. Sober Ted. Clear-eyed

Ted. We want you to be the diceman.

ANGELA

Helluva night, huh, Ted?

TED

I gotta get out of here.

CHESTER

Ted, I got a hundred-dollar bill

here with your name on it, whether

you do what we ask or not, just to

sit back down in the chair for one

minute more.

TED

I'm not gonna cut off his finger!

CHESTER

Maybe you will and maybe you won't,

but that has nothing to do with this

hundred-dollar bill in my hand. You

can tell us all to go fuck off and

walk right out that door. But if you

sit back down and wait sixty seconds

before you do it, you'll be a hundred

dollars richer.

ANGELA

Ted. Take the money.

LEO

Ted, you're gonna do whatever you

want to do. We're just askin' you to

indulge us for another minute more.

And Chester's willin' to pay for it.

TED

I'll take your money, and I'll sit

back down. But a minute from now,

I'm gonna walk out the door, and

when I do, there'll be no hard

feelings?

CHESTER

Well, I want you to have a bit more

of an open mind than that, but, yeah,

we'll either convince you or we won't.

No hard feelings. Right, guys?

CHESTER

Okay, Leo, you be the timekeeper.

Let us know when one minute begins

and when it ends.

LEO

You got it.

(he checks his watch)

Gentlemen, start your engines.

LEO

Begin!

CHESTER

Okay, pay attention here, Ted, I

ain't got much time. Now I'm gonna

make two piles here on the bar.

(he takes the hundred-

dollar bill and lays

it out on the bar)

One pile,

(pointing at the

hundred-dollar bill)

which is yours. And another pile,

(Chester whips out a

money roll fat enough

to choke a horse to

death)

which could be yours.

(he lays a matching

hundred-dollar bill

on the bar, starting

a second pile)

Now, what you have to be aware of is

we're gonna do this bet, one way,

(he lays another

hundred on the end

pile)

or the other.

(he lays another

hundred on the pile)

Whether it's you who holds the ax,

(he lays another

hundred on the pile)

or the desk clerk downstairs,

(he lays another

hundred on the pile)

or some bum we yank off the street.

(he lays another

hundred on the pile)

NORMAN

You can buy a lot of soup with that

pile.

CHESTER

(to Norman)

Shhhh, I'm the closer.

(to the group)

How much is on the bar already? I

lost count.

ANGELA

Six hundred.

CHESTER

Six hundred. Ted, do you know how

long it takes the average American

to count to six hundred?

TED

No.

CHESTER

(laying another bill

on the pile)

One minute less than it takes to

count to seven hundred. You know,

Ted, a person's life is made up of a

zillion little experiences.

(he lays another bill

on the pile)

Some, which have no meaning, are

insignificant and you forget them.

And some that stick with you for the

rest of your natural life --

(he lays another bill

on the pile)

-- barring Alzheimer's of course.

Now, what we're proposing is so

unusual, so outside the norm, that I

think it would be a pretty good guess

that this will be one of those

experiences that sticks. So, since

you're gonna be stuck remembering

this moment for the rest of your

life, you gotta decide what that

memory will be.

(He lays down the

last bill on the

pile)

So, are you gonna remember for the

next forty years, give or take a

decade, how you refused a thousand

dollars for one second's worth of

work, or how you made a thousand

dollars for one second's worth of

work?

LEO

Time!

CHESTER

Well, Ted, what's it gonna be?

TED

Okay.

TED

But when it's over, no matter what

happens, I get the money?

CHESTER

As long as you do your part, you can

take the pile, walk out the door,

and not say another word.

TED

Let's do it right now, before I change

my mind.

NORMAN

Here, here.

CHESTER

Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect!

This is great! This is a moment in

time none of us will ever forget.

CHESTER

Norman, you ready?

NORMAN

Ready!

CHESTER

Ted, you ready?

TED

Ready.

CHESTER

Okeydoke. Norman, begin.

NORMAN

My finger, my fucking finger!!

ANGELA

You know, I'm gonna call it a night

and go back to my room. It's been

fun.

FOUR ROOMS

ANGELA

You okay, lady?

ANGELA

I said -- you looking for someone?

DIANA

(disoriented)

Uhhh... yes... my husband... I think.

Have you seen him?

ANGELA

Lady, I haven't seen anybody.

SIGFRIED

Where the hell have you been?
