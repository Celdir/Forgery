MERRILL

Where are they?

CHILDREN

(yelling in the distance)

Daaaad!

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

Bo where's Morgan?

GRAHAM

Bo?

BO

Are you in my dreams too?

GRAHAM

This isn't a --

BOY (O.S.)

Dad!

GRAHAM

Morgan what's happening?

GRAHAM

Are... you... hurt?

MORGAN

I think God did it.

GRAHAM

Did what Morgan?

"BUCKS COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA...

THIRTY MILES OUTSIDE PHILADELPHIA"

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

(into phone)

... Lee actually the reason I'm

calling is about Lionel.

GRAHAM

(into phone)

Was he at home last night with you

or was he out and about with the

Wolfington brothers?

GRAHAM

(into phone)

Well, there was a little mischief

done to our crops last night.

GRAHAM

(into phone)

I know he's a fine boy... No one's

saying otherwise.

GRAHAM

(into phone)

Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it

was him.  You could just talk to

him and that would be enough for

me... See it was kind of strange

finding the crops like that.  The

kids were... confused by it.  It

would take the strangeness away if

we knew it was Lionel and the

Wolfington brothers just messing

around...

(beat, listens)

The movies...

(beat)

Are you sure?

(beat)

Okay, then... Thank you for your

patience Lee.

MORGAN

Houdini peed.  I think he's sick.

GRAHAM

Take him outside.  I'll call Dr.

Reynolds.

GRAHAM

That was quick Edgar.  I only

called you boys about two hours

ago.

OFFICER PASKI

Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as

she put it, "diving for her life"

when a bunch of school kids rode

down the sidewalk on skateboards.

She went down to Thorton's store

this morning and started spitting

on the new skateboards.  Spitting!

By the time I got there, Mrs.

Kindleman had sprayed the whole

damn place... She must have had a

cold or something.  It was enough

to turn a grown man's stomach.

OFFICER PASKI

So what happened to your crops?

CUT TO:

BO

I think it's contaminated.

MORGAN

You don't even know what that word

means.

MORGAN

It's not contaminated.  It's just

tap water.  Pour it in his bowl.

BO

It tastes funny.

MORGAN

He licks his butt everyday.  He's

not going to mind.

MORGAN

Houdini?

MORGAN

Bo don't run.

MORGAN

What's wrong boy?

MORGAN

Stop it Houdini!

MORGAN

(soft)

Bo, run.

CUT TO:

OFFICER PASKI

(yelling)

It's the strangest thing Father.

GRAHAM

(yelling)

Don't call me Father.

OFFICER PASKI

(yelling)

What's that?

GRAHAM

(yelling)

Don't call me Father.  It's just

Graham now.

OFFICER PASKI

(yelling)

Sorry.

GRAHAM

(yelling)

You said something was strange.

What's strange?

OFFICER PASKI

(yelling)

The footprints.

GRAHAM

(yelling)

What about them?

OFFICER PASKI

(yelling)

There are none.

CUT TO:

OFFICER PASKI

(soft)

Look at where it's bent over.

GRAHAM

It's not broken.

OFFICER PASKI

What kind of machine can bend a

stalk of corn over without cracking

it?

GRAHAM

(softy)

Can't be by hand... It's too

perfect.

OFFICER PASKI

Doesn't sound much like Lionel

Prichard and the Wolfington

brothers.  They can't take a piss

without wetting the front of their

pants.

OFFICER PASKI

Second thing this week I can't

explain.

GRAHAM

What was the first thing?

OFFICER PASKI

Some animals around the county

exhibiting uncharacteristic

behavior.  Sometimes violent

behavior.  Theo Henry had two of

his fingers bit off by his cow.

GRAHAM

Sounds like a virus.

OFFICER PASKI

No Father, they're edgy.  On alert.

Like they act when they smell a

predator around... Peeing on

themselves and everything.

GRAHAM

(preoccupied)

Edgar, please don't call me Father.

OFFICER PASKI

What's wrong?

GRAHAM

I don't hear my children.

CUT TO:

MORGAN

(soft)

He wanted to kill Bo.

GRAHAM

Did he hurt you?

GRAHAM

(whispers in his ear)

I'm so sorry Morgan.

MERRILL

I used a little Tabasco in the

potato salad.

BO

Houdini's sick.

GRAHAM

Please tie up Isabelle to the back

of the shed.  Make sure the knot's

tight.

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

They're tough cookies, those two.

They think Houdini's playing with

you up there.

(beat)

At least it got them to sleep.

GRAHAM

Okay Miss Puzzle Master.  I got one

for you... What can make geometric

shapes the size of a football

field... and what would scare every

animal in this county?

(beat)

Have you figured it out yet?

(smiles)

You probably have...

(beat)

Give me a hint Colleen... Is it

bigger than a bread box?

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

What's the matter?

BO

I saw a monster.  Can I have a

glass of water?

GRAHAM

What's wrong with the water next to

your bed?

BO

It tastes old.

GRAHAM

What's the rule about getting up in

the middle of the night?

BO

Only for pee or poop.

GRAHAM

Right.

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

(soft)

What are you thinking about?

BO

(soft)

Why do you talk to mom when you're

by yourself?

GRAHAM

(soft)

It makes me feel better.

BO

(soft)

Does she ever answer back?

GRAHAM

(soft)

No.

BO

(soft)

She doesn't answer me either.

BO

(soft)

Get under a blanket.  They can't

get you under the blankets.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MERRILL

Okay, this guy is trying to scare

us.  He's messed with our property,

he's coming around the house.  It's

time for an ass whoopin'!

GRAHAM

This is not an intelligent way to

approach this.

MERRILL

(whispering)

We both go outside and move around

the house in opposite directions.

We act crazy, insane with anger.

Make him crap in his pants and

force him around till we meet up on

the other side.

GRAHAM

(whispering)

Explain, act crazy?

MERRILL

(whispering)

Curse and stuff.

GRAHAM

(whispering)

I'm not going to curse.

MERRILL

(whispering)

You don't mean it.  It's just for

show.

GRAHAM

(whispering)

It doesn't sound natural when I

curse.

MERRILL

(whispering)

Just make noises then.

GRAHAM

(whispering)

Explain noises.

MERRILL

(whispering)

Are you going to do this or what?

GRAHAM

(whispering)

No I'm not.

MERRILL

(whispering)

You want him coming in the house

next time?

MERRILL

(hushed tone)

On the count of three.

(beat)

One... two... three.

CUT TO:

MERRILL

We're gonna beat your ass bitch!

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

Ahhhh... I'm insane with anger.

GRAHAM

I've lost my mind!  It's time for

an ass whoopin'!

CUT TO:

MERRILL

I'm gonna tear your head off!

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

I cursed.

MERRILL

I heard.

GRAHAM

He's on the roof.

MERRILL (V.O.)

It was very dark.

GRAHAM (V.O.)

Yes it was.

CUT TO:

OFFICER PASKI

You can't describe him at all?

Don't you think that's find of odd?

GRAHAM

It does seem kind of odd doesn't

it?

OFFICER PASKI

I don't know whether to look for a

midget or a --

GRAHAM

He definitely wasn't a midget.

OFFICER PASKI

Okay.

(beat)

So he was tall?

GRAHAM

(to Merrill)

I would say so.

MERRILL

Probably.

OFFICER PASKI

Over six feet?

MERRILL

It was very dark.

GRAHAM

Yes, it was.

OFFICER PASKI

We've established that.

(beat)

Just tell me about his clothing

then.

OFFICER PASKI

Was he wearing a Scottish kilt or

jeans?

OFFICER PASKI

Let me ask you two something.

Don't be embarrassed by the answer.

It is possible... Just possible

now, you might have been chasing

each other around?  You said you

went in opposite directions.

GRAHAM

Edgar, it sounds as strange to me

saying it, as it is to you hearing

it.  But we couldn't see him.  He

stayed mostly in the shadows.  All

we could make out was movement.

(beat)

But I'll tell you something with

absolute certainty.  There was

someone watching our house last

night.  He was looking in my

children's windows and I want you

to find him Edgar.

(beat)

I need you to take this seriously,

just incase, it is something

serious.

OFFICER PASKI

I apologize.

MORGAN

Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as

a walkie-talkie?

GRAHAM

Yes.

MORGAN

It needs batteries.

GRAHAM

Edgar, come inside.

OFFICER PASKI

How certain are you, that this was

a male?

MERRILL

I don't know any girls can run like

that.

MORGAN

These are D's; I need double A's.

GRAHAM

I have some upstairs.

OFFICER PASKI

I don't know Merrill.  I've seen

some of those women on the

Olympics.  They could out run me

easy.

MERRILL

This guy got on the roof in like a

second.

GRAHAM

Bo, can you turn down the volume

until Officer Paski leaves?

MERRILL

That roof is over ten feet high.

GRAHAM

He's telling you the truth, Edgar.

Whoever it was, is very strong and

can jump pretty high.

OFFICER PASKI

They got women's high jumping in

the Olympics.  They got these

Scandinavian women who could jump

clean over me.

GRAHAM

Shoot, it needs a screw driver.  I

have double A's in here.

GRAHAM

I know you're making a point Edgar.

I just don't know what it is.

OFFICER PASKI

Yesterday afternoon, an out of town

woman stopped by the diner and

started yelling and cussing cause

they didn't have her favorite

cigarettes at the vending machine.

Scared a couple of customers.  No

one's seen her since... My point

is, we don't know anything about

the person you saw.  We should just

keep all possibilities available.

BO

Dad, where's the remote?

GRAHAM

Bo, you're too old to still be

doing this.  The rule is, you take

a glass of water, you finish it.

(beat)

Now what's wrong with this one?

BO

There's dust in it.

GRAHAM

This one?

BO

A hair.

GRAHAM

This one?

BO

Morgan took a sip.  It has his

amoebas in it.

MERRILL

Excluding the possibility that a

female Scandinavian Olympian was

running around outside our house

last night, what else is a

possibility?

OFFICER PASKI

I'm not done asking questions and I

don't appreciate the sarcasm.

OFFICER PASKI

Do you have anyone who might have a

grudge or something against you?

Maybe a church member, who might

not have liked the fact, that you

left the church?

GRAHAM

I don't think so.

OFFICER PASKI

Do you owe anybody money?  You can

tell me off the record if you need

too.

GRAHAM

No.

MERRILL

No.

OFFICER PASKI

Is anything missing?

GRAHAM

No.

MORGAN

It's still making the noises.  It's

broken.

GRAHAM

It's old Morgan.

MERRILL

Listen, I was out of line with that

whole female Scandinavian Olympian

thing.

MERRILL

It's just that, I'm pretty strong

and pretty fast.  And I was running

as fast as I could.  And this

guy...

(embarrassed smile)

He was just toying with us.

CUT TO:

OFFICER PASKI

Could everyone just take a seat on

the couch.  I have some preliminary

thoughts.

OFFICER PASKI

There are three possibilities here.

We'll call them one, two and three.

The level one scenario is that

there is a sane individual, who for

real reasons wants to do you harm.

I really don't believe that's what

we're looking at here.  In my

opinion, whoever this is, they

don't want to do harm to you all.

That's kind of clear.

(beat)

The level two scenario is, this is

a mentally unstable person who's

fixated on you and your family.

This is a possibility, but a very

slim one.

(beat)

I assure you I will treat all three

possibilities carefully, but in all

likely hood we are looking at what

we'll call a level three scenario.

He's a watcher.  Someone who this

is a game for.  He's laying low.

Doesn't want to be seen.  But he

wants to watch you.  Study you

folks.

OFFICER PASKI

Now I don't want you all to worry

about this no more.  You're making

more of this than it is.

(beat)

You guys have had a tough couple of

days with the vandalism to the

crops and the death of your

shepherd.

(beat)

Maybe you guys should do something

fun?  Let me worry about this

person.  Let me find out who it is

and then -- What the hell are you

people looking at?

OFFICER PASKI

I'll be damned.

GRAHAM

Turn up the volume Bo.

BO

I can't find the remote.

TV ANCHOR

-- images were shot yesterday

afternoon by a thirty-four year old

local camera man in Kerala, a

southern city of India.  It is the

eighteenth reported crop circle

found in that country in the last

seventy-two hours.

PROFESSOR (TV)

Crop circles first emerged in the

late seventies with the renewed

interest in extraterrestrial life.

They died out by the early

eighties; dismissed as hoaxes.

This new resurgence is wholly

different.  Elements of it are

unexplainable.  The speed and the

quantity in which it has appeared

implies the coordination of

hundreds of individuals over many

countries...

(beat)

There is only a limited amount of

explanations.  Either this is one

of the most elaborate hoaxes ever

created, or basically...

(beat)

It's for real.

MORGAN

(wonder)

Extraterrestrials.

OFFICER PASKI

What in God's name is going on?

CUT TO:

OFFICER PASKI

Don't ask me what I think.  Cause I

can't think straight right now.

I'm going back to the station.

Have a cup of Marcia's coffee and

try to think clear.  After that I

might make some calls.

(beat)

Hoaxes... People got way too much

time on their hands.

OFFICER PASKI

But I'll tell you something, what I

said in their, still goes.  You and

your family have been through a lot

in the last two days... Not to

mention what happened to you all

seven months ago.

GRAHAM

Six months.

GRAHAM

And three weeks.

OFFICER PASKI

It's left its mark still.  The last

thing these children need to do, is

worry about some crazy things

happening in the world.  Take them

into town.  Get their minds -- your

mind, on everyday things.  It's

good medicine.

GRAHAM

It's good advice...

(beat)

Say hi to Marcia for me.

OFFICER PASKI

You take care of yourself...

(beat)

Graham.

CUT TO:

RADIO VOICE

... signs intended to be seen from

the sky --

GRAHAM

No radio either... Just for a

while.

CUT TO:

MORGAN

Book money.

GRAHAM

Only one.

GRAHAM

(calls out)

Meet back in fifteen minutes.

CUT TO:

MORGAN

Extraterrestrials?

MR. NATHAN

That's what they keep alluding to.

It's just a bunch of crock.

They're trying to sell sodas, plain

and simple.  I've been watching

these reports since morning.  I've

seen twelve soda commercials so

far.  Twelve!

MORGAN

Do you have book on

extraterrestrials?

MR. NATHAN

Don't tell me you believe this

horse manure?

MRS. NATHAN

As a matter of fact, I think we

have one.  Came by mistake in a

shipment.  Decided to keep it for

city people.

MRS. NATHAN

Last row.  Third book from the left

honey.

CUT TO:

RADIO HOST (V.O.)

Why is no one saying the obvious?

This is just a rash case of

copycats.  Someone, somewhere, does

the first one.  It's on TV, it's on

the internet.  In less than an hour

a couple hundred people get the

same brilliant idea and here we

are... on the verge of mass

hysteria.

PHARMACIST

It was asthma medicine right

Father?

GRAHAM

For Morgan Hess.  And it's not

Father anymore.

PHARMACIST

Can I ask you a favor Father?

PHARMACIST

Can I take confession with you?

GRAHAM

Tracey, I -- am -- not -- a --

reverend -- anymore.  I haven't

been for six months.  You know

this.

TRACEY

All this stuff on TV...

(beat)

Joe Gills was in here talking about

the end of the world... I'm just a

little scared.

(beat)

Please.  I need to take confession

with you.

CUT TO:

CREWCUT GUY

I got it figured.

MERRILL

You do?

CREWCUT GUY

I've had two separate folks tell me

they think there are strangers

around these parts the last couple

of nights.  Can't tell what they

look like, cause they're staying in

the shadows -- covert like.  No

one's got hurt mind you... And

that's the give away.

MERRILL

(doesn't see)

I see.

CREWCUT GUY

It's called probing.  It's a

military procedure.  You send a

reconnaissance group, very small,

to check out things.  Not to

engage, but to evaluate the

situation.  Evaluate the level of

danger.  Make sure things are all

clear...

MERRILL

Clear for what?

CREWCUT GUY

... For the rest of them.

MERRILL

You have a pamphlet or something I

can read?

CREWCUT GUY

Hey you didn't used to play

baseball did you?

CREWCUT GUY

Shit.  I know you.  You're Merrill

Hess.  I was there that day you hit

that five hundred and eighty seven

footer over the left field wall and

set the record.  That thing had a

motor on it... It's still the

record right?

MERRILL

(soft)

I got the bat at home... On the

wall.

CREWCUT GUY

You got two minor league home run

records don't you?

MERRILL

Five.  The five longest.

CREWCUT GUY

Boy, why aren't you in the pros

making stacks of cash and getting

handfuls of T and A?

YOUNG MAN (O.S.)

Cause he also has the minor league

strike out record.

MERRILL

Hello Lionel.

LIONEL

He'd just swing as hard as he could

every time.  It didn't matter what

the coach said, didn't matter who

was on base, he'd whip that bat

through the air as hard as he

could... Looked like a lumber jack

chopping down a tree.

(beat)

Merrill here, struck out more times

than any two players.

CREWCUT GUY

You really hold the strike out

record?

MERRILL

Felt wrong not to swing.

CUT TO:

PHARMACIST

I cursed thirty-seven times last

week... I said the f-word a couple

times, but mostly "shits" and

"bastards."

(beat)

Is "Douche bag" a curse?

GRAHAM

I suppose it's in its usage.

PHARMACIST

How about "John you're a douche bag

for kissing Barbara?"

GRAHAM

That's a curse.

PHARMACIST

Then it's not thirty-seven.  It's

seventy-one.

PHARMACIST

I stole a bottle of Ruby red lip

stick from K-mart... I punched my

brother in the back three times...

CUT TO:

BO

It's contaminated.

MRS. NATHAN

Carl, there's something wrong with

our water!

MORGAN

Your water is fine.  Bo has a thing

about her drinking water.  She's

had it her whole life.  Like a tick

people have.  Except it's not a

tick.

MRS. NATHAN

(fascinated)

Is that right?

MR. NATHAN (O.S.)

Thirteen!

MORGAN

I'll take it.

CUT TO:

MERRILL

Pharmacy crowded?

GRAHAM

I don't want any one of you

spending time with Tracey Abernathy

alone.  Is that understood?

MORGAN

(soft)

Is that him?

MERRILL

(soft)

Yeah.

BO

Who is he?

MORGAN

He's the man who killed mom.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MORGAN

What if Bo's baby monitor is

picking up signals from the

extraterrestrials?

MERRILL

All this crop stuff.  They did it

twenty-five years ago.  It was a

joke.

GRAHAM

It's just static Morgan.  Turn it

up and see.

MORGAN

It's a code.

GRAHAM

Let me see that please.

MERRILL

It's noise.

GRAHAM

It's broken Morgan.  It'll just

keep doing this.

(beat)

Let's get out of the car okay?

MORGAN

We might lose the signal.

GRAHAM

We can't just sit in the car in our

own driveway like this.

MERRILL

We'll look like mental patients.

GRAHAM

I'm getting out now.

MORGAN

Don't do it.

MORGAN

Nobody move!

MORGAN

Voices.  Did you hear that?

MORGAN

Not English though.  You heard the

voices right Uncle Merrill?

BO

I heard them Morgan.

GRAHAM

It's probably picking up another

baby monitor.

MERRILL

That's right.

MERRILL

Let me see it.

MORGAN

Stop!

MORGAN

It doesn't sound like words.

GRAHAM

See this is why we're not watching

those news reports.  People get

obsessed.

(beat)

I'm letting go now.

BO

No dad!

MORGAN

Don't do it!

MERRILL

You'll lose the signal!

MORGAN

Don't let go.

GRAHAM

Morgan?

MORGAN

It gets clearer, the higher you

hold it.

GRAHAM

Morgan, be careful.

MERRILL

I got him.

GRAHAM

Hold on.

GRAHAM

Merrill you got her.

MORGAN

Stop!

MORGAN

(soft)

There's two of them talking.

MORGAN

(soft)

They hung up.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

You know something?  Even

entertaining the possibility of

this for a minute has been

exciting.

GRAHAM

I can see how people can get

carried away with this type of

thing.

GRAHAM

It's a kind of faith.  It's an

intoxicating thing to believe in

something you can't see.

GRAHAM

You were always good at that...

GRAHAM

Believing in things you couldn't

see.

(beat)

You would have been the first

person on that station wagon

wouldn't you?  You and Morgan would

have been wrestling for that baby

monitor.

GRAHAM

It'll be secretly kind of sad for

everybody, when this turns out to

be -- all just make believe.

GRAHAM

(yelling)

You're wasting your time here!  I'm

not going to report this or

anything you do to me crops, to the

news or TV or anybody!  You're not

going to get famous!

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

(soft)

Okay.

(beat)

Let's turn on the TV.

CUT TO:

TV REPORTER

-- first appeared fifty two minutes

ago.

BO

Fourteen.

TV ANCHOR

Mexico City officials as well as

U.S. officials have confirmed that

these are not air crafts from

either government's airforce.  The

first sighting was made by an Air

Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlan

to New York as the unidentified

crafts entered Mexico City air

space.  They were not detected by

radar by either country.

MERRILL

The crazies were right.

MORGAN

We have to tape this...

BO

My ballet recital.

MORGAN

(gravely serious)

Listen Bo.  This is very important.

Everything people have written

about in science books is going to

change.  The history of the world's

future is on the TV right now.  We

need to record this so you can show

your children this tape and say you

were there...

(beat)

For your children Bo.

BO

My ballet recital.

MORGAN

Dad!

GRAHAM

(preoccupied)

Find another tape.

MORGAN

Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.

TV ANCHOR

... You're seeing a live feed from

our NBC affiliate down in Mexico

City.  The time there is 7:17pm.

This image has not been adjusted or

enhanced in any way.  What you're

seeing is real.

(beat)

Everything they wrote in science

books is about to change.

MORGAN

(soft)

Told you.

DISSOLVE TO:

MERRILL

(whispers)

Some people are probably thinking

this is the end of the world.

GRAHAM

(whispers)

That's true.

MERRILL

(whispers)

Do you think it's a possibility?

GRAHAM

(whispers)

Yes.

MERRILL

(whispers)

How can you say that?

GRAHAM

(whispers)

That wasn't the answer you wanted?

MERRILL

(whispers)

Can you at least pretend to be like

you used to be?  Give me some

comfort?

GRAHAM

(whispers)

... There are all different ways

you can tell that there's someone

really there watching out for us.

You see signs.  Sometimes they're

little ones.  You think of someone.

The phone rings.  They're on the

phone... Sometimes they're big,

like fourteen lights hovering over

Mexico City.

(beat)

Sure, there are a lot of people

watching this who think this could

be a bad thing.  But there are a

lot of people watching this, who

think it's a miracle.  A sign of

God's existence.  It's all in how

you look at things Merrill.

(beat)

What you have to decide is what

kind of person you are?  Are you

the type who believes in miracles

and looks for signs or are you the

kind who believes, things just

happen by chance?

MERRILL

I was at this party once.  I'm on a

couch with Sara Mckinney.  She was

just sitting there, looking

beautiful and staring at me.  I go

to lean in and kiss her and I

realize I have gum in my mouth.  I

turn and take out the gum.  Stuff

it in my paper cup next to the sofa

and turn around.  Sara Mckinney

throws up all over herself.

(beat)

I knew the second it happened.  It

was a miracle.  I could have been

kissing her when she threw up.

That would have scarred me for

life.  I may never have recovered.

MERRILL

I'm a miracle man.  Those lights

are a miracle.

GRAHAM

(whispers)

There you go.

MERRILL

(whispers)

So which type are you?

GRAHAM

(whispers)

Do you feel comforted?

MERRILL

(whispers)

Yes.

GRAHAM

(whispers)

What does it matter then?

GRAHAM

(whispers)

Do you know what Colleen's last

words were before they killed her?

GRAHAM

(whispers)

She said, "See", and then her eyes

glazed a bit and she said... "Tell

Merrill to swing away."

GRAHAM

(whispers)

Do you know why she said that?

GRAHAM

(whispers)

Because the nerve endings in her

brain were firing as she died, and

some random memory of us at one of

your baseball games popped into her

head.

(beat)

There is no one watching out for us

Merrill.  We're all on our own.

CUT TO:

MERRILL

For the kids protection.  All they

were doing was watching TV from

five a.m.  I felt like they were

getting obsessed like you said.

They should be playing furry, furry

rabbit or tea party or something

right?

GRAHAM

What's furry, furry rabbit?

MERRILL

(points)

That's a game isn't it?

(beat)

Anyway...

(points at the TV)

There's been some interesting

developments.

GRAHAM

What time is it?

MERRILL

Eleven a.m.  They're gone.

MERRILL

But they're not really gone.  We

just can't see them.  Early this

morning a bird flew right at the

area where the lights were hovering

last night.

MERRILL

It stopped dead in the air and fell

straight down.

MERRILL

They caught it on tape and they've

been playing it all morning.  They

found the bird.  His head crushed

in.  When you see the footage it

looks like the bird flew into a

wall in the sky.

(beat)

They think they have some invisible

shield thing going, like an optical

illusion.

GRAHAM

The bird could have had a heart

attack and crushed his head when he

fell.

MERRILL

Already thought of.  Two other

birds did the same thing an hour

later.  Not as dramatic.  They

lived.  But you could see they hit

something.

MERRILL

They're still there hovering.  In

fact, some people think there's

more of them now.  All over the

place.  Over us even.

(beat)

And there's a theory about the crop

circles now.  They think it could

be some kind of landmark, visual

mapping system -- so they can

navigate.  Coordinate.  Makes sense

doesn't it?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MORGAN

So the aliens can't read our minds.

GRAHAM

Oh.

MORGAN

They tell you everything in this

book.

MORGAN

It says they're probably very small

-- like my height -- because, as

their brains developed, there was

no use for physical development.

It says they're probably

vegetarians, because they would

have realized the benefits of such

a diet.

GRAHAM

Who wrote this book?

MORGAN

Scientists who have been persecuted

for their beliefs.

GRAHAM

That means they're unemployed.

MORGAN

Dad, are you going to be serious?

BO

Yeah, serious.

GRAHAM

I don't know what got into me.

MORGAN

There are pictures.

MORGAN

Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of

the book --

GRAHAM

Bimboo?

MORGAN

Dad.

GRAHAM

I just asked his name.

MERRILL

You had a tone.

MORGAN

He says there are two reasons why

Extraterrestrials would visit us.

MORGAN

To make contact in the spirit of

exploration and furthering the

knowledge of the universe.

MORGAN

Or the other reason... They're

hostile.  They've used up the

resources on their planet and are

looking to harvest our planet next.

GRAHAM

Looks a little like our house

doesn't it?

BO

The same windows.

MORGAN

(soft)

That's weird.

GRAHAM

That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for

now.  Everybody in this house needs

to calm down and eat some fruit or

something.

PHONE VOICE

Father.

GRAHAM

Hello?

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

I'm going out for a few minutes.

No one leaves this house.  No one.

MERRILL

Where are you going?

GRAHAM

Ray Reddy's house.

MERRILL

Why?

GRAHAM

I think he just called here.

CUT TO:

BO (O.S.)

You don't think something bad will

happen do you Morgan?

MORGAN

Why, you got one of your feeling

again?

MORGAN

Is it bad?

MORGAN

If it does, I won't let anything

bad happen to you.

BO

(soft)

I don't want you to die.

MORGAN

Who said I was going to die?

MORGAN

Who said I was going to die?

MORGAN

Come on Bo.  I need to keep a look

out.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

Hello Ray.

GRAHAM

What happened Ray?

RAY

I wrote your number down to call

you.  It's been sitting next to the

phone for six months.  When I knew

it was inside the house, I couldn't

think of any other number to call.

I panicked.

(beat)

Thank you for coming Father.

GRAHAM

(soft)

You're welcome Ray.

RAY

I worked so long that night.  I

ain't never fallen asleep driving

before.  And never since.  Most of

the ride home, there wasn't a car

insight in either direction.  If

I'd fallen asleep then, I'd a ended

up in a ditch with a head ache.  It

had to happen at that right moment.

That certain ten-fifteen seconds

when I passed her walking.  It was

like it was meant to be.

RAY

I guess if this is the end of the

world, I'm screwed right?  People

who kill Reverends' wives aren't

exactly ushered to the front of the

line in heaven.

GRAHAM

Where you going Ray?

RAY

To the lake.  The way I see it, all

the places marked in the crops and

such -- none of them are really

near water.  I figure they don't

like water.

(beat)

Can't be any worse than here.

GRAHAM

Ray, did you see one of them?

RAY

I'm truly sorry for what I've done

to you and yours.

RAY

And don't open my pantry Father.  I

locked one of them in there.

TV ANCHOR

... The startling footage we're

about to show you was photographed

by a forty-two year old Romero

Valadares.

TV ANCHOR

This video was taken yesterday

afternoon at his son's seventh

birthday, in the city of Passo

Fundo, Brazil.  It was sent to the

local news bureau there and

satellited to us a few minutes ago.

All initial opinions are; this is

genuine.

TV ANCHOR

What you are about to see, may

disturb you.

Move children!  Vamonos!

Hello.

GRAHAM

(loud)

The police are here... I am with

them... I am a police officer.

(beat)

I just want to talk to you.

GRAHAM

(loud)

We know all about the hoax.  We

already took some of your friends

downtown in the paddy wagon.

(mouths to himself)

Paddy wagon?

GRAHAM

If you tell us your name and why

you did it, we'll give you the same

deal we gave the others.  Don't

throw away your life son.

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

(soft)

Douche bag.

CUT TO:

MERRILL

They're skin changes color.  That's

why we couldn't see him that night.

GRAHAM

Tell me something Morgan.  In that

book of your, did they happen to

detail what would happen if they

were hostile?

MORGAN

Yes.  They would invade us using

only ground tactics.  Hand to hand

combat.  They wouldn't use their

technology or fight an airborne

battle, because they would know we

would eventually use nuclear

weapons and the planet would be

useless to them.

MERRILL

I'm sorry, what book is this?

GRAHAM

Did they say what our chances would

be if they did invade?

MORGAN

They said one of two things could

happen.  One, they fight and are

defeated and leave to return again

with full forces hundreds or even

thousands of years later.

GRAHAM

What's two?

MORGAN

They win.

GRAHAM

What do you think about the idea

that they don't like places near

water, and we might be safe from

them near a lake or something?

MORGAN

Sounds made up.

GRAHAM

We can choose to believe it and

pack up and leave.

(beat)

Or we can stay here.  Board up this

house.  Hide inside our home and

wait it out.  Either way, at least

we'll be together.

(beat)

All those in favor of the lake,

raise your hand.

GRAHAM

All those in favor of home, raise

your hand.

MERRILL

How do we know boards will do

anything?

GRAHAM

(soft)

Because, they seem to have trouble

with pantry doors.

Come quick!

TV ANCHOR

Tel Aviv joins Nairobi, Lagos and

Jerusalem as the latest to confirm

the appearance of lights.  There

are lights in the skies over an

estimated two hundred and seventy

four cities.  That total could be

as high as four hundred within the

hour.

GRAHAM

They decided to show themselves.

MORGAN

They think these look like stages

immediately proceeding an attack

maneuver.

MERRILL

It's like War of the Worlds.

MORGAN

They think it might happen all at

once.

TV ANCHOR

Hundreds of thousands have flocked

to synagogues, churches and

temples.

TV ANCHOR

Ground forces are being assembled

in countries throughout the

globe...

GRAHAM

I'm going to get back to the

windows.

MERRILL

(whispers)

You guys okay?

MORGAN

Some guy had a sign that said it

was the end of the world.

(beat)

Nothing really bad is going to

happen, is it Uncle Merrill?

MERRILL

Don't worry.

MORGAN

You sure right?

MERRILL

You know about signs Morgan?  Not

like the ones people write on.

It's like if you poured a glass of

milk and you dropped the glass by

mistake and broke it before you

could drink it.  Then you looked at

the milk carton and saw that the

milk was spoiled.  They're things

that happen by chance or luck, but

make you feel that someone's

watching out for you.

MORGAN

I once had a bad dream and I

couldn't wake up.  I kicked at the

table next to my bed and something

fell on me and I woke up.  It was a

picture of mom.  She was smiling.

It made me feel safe... You mean

like that?

MERRILL

Yeah, like that.

(beat)

I believe in signs Morgan.  I think

there's someone watching out for

us.  I got to believe he's going to

make sure we're all right in the

end.

MORGAN

What about Isabelle?

GRAHAM

We'll keep her in the garage, after

dinner.

MERRILL

I'll make sandwiches.

BO

I want spaghetti?

MERRILL

We should eat fast Bo.

GRAHAM

Spaghetti sounds great.

GRAHAM

What do you want, Morgan?

MORGAN

Anything?

MORGAN

French toast... and mashed

potatoes.

GRAHAM

Now we're talking.

How about you Merrill?

MERRILL

Chicken Teriyaki.

Good choice... I'm going to have a

cheeseburger with bacon.

Extra bacon.

GRAHAM

What's the matter with everyone?

Eat.

MORGAN

I'm scared.

BO

Me too.

GRAHAM

I don't want to hear anymore talk

like that.  And I don't want to see

anymore faces like the ones I'm

looking at.

We are going to enjoy this meal.

Nothing can stop us from enjoying

this meal!  Enjoy!

GRAHAM

Stop crying!

MORGAN

Don't yell at her!

GRAHAM

Fine, if you all don't want to eat,

then I'm going to have some of

everything.

GRAHAM

This tastes so great.

GRAHAM

It's happening.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MERRILL

Graham hurry.

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

Did I ever tell you what everyone

said when you were born, Bo?

GRAHAM

You came out of your momma and you

didn't even cry.  You just opened

your eyes and looked around at

everybody.  Your eyes were so big

and gorgeous, the ladies in the

room gasped.

GRAHAM

They literally gasped.

(Graham gasps like them)

Then they go, "She's like an

angel."  They said, "We've never

seen a baby so beautiful."

GRAHAM

(soft)

And you know what else happened?

GRAHAM

(soft)

When they put you on the table to

clean you up, you looked at me and

smiled.  They say babies that young

can't smile... You smiled.

GRAHAM

(soft)

Let's go down now.

CUT TO:

MORGAN

We forgot about Isabelle.

MERRILL

(whispers)

Should we turn off the lights?

GRAHAM

(soft)

They already know we're here.

MORGAN

(almost inaudible)

Dad --

GRAHAM

Do you know what happened when you

were born Morgan?

GRAHAM

You came out and your momma kept

bleeding.  The doctors rushed you

out of the room before I could even

see you.

MERRILL

They're on the roof.

GRAHAM

While they were trying to fix her

up, all she kept asking about was

you.

MERRILL

They're in the house.

GRAHAM

I wanted your momma to see you

first.  She had dreamed about you

her whole life.

(beat)

They waited till she felt better,

then they brought you in.  They

placed you right in her arms.  And

she looked at you.  And you looked

at her.  You just stared at each

other for the longest time and then

she said real soft, "Hello Morgan,

I'm you momma, you look just like I

dreamed."

MERRILL

The attic door.

CUT TO:

MERRILL

This is a very temporary solution.

GRAHAM

How temporary?

MERRILL

Twenty-two seconds.

GRAHAM

Let go.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MERRILL

This is going to do nothing.

GRAHAM

We have to go in the basement.

MERRILL

There's no way out of there.

GRAHAM

Did I ever tell you, I dislocated

Uncle Merrill's arm?

MERRILL

Should we make a run for it out the

back?

GRAHAM

They're right behind the door.

GRAHAM

He was only a year and half old.

MERRILL

(to Graham)

What are you doing?

GRAHAM

He was trying to eat a second

chocolate bar.  Your grandma said,

"No."  He tried to take a bite, so

I grabbed it.

GRAHAM

I must have pulled his arm at an

awkward angle.  His elbow popped

right out of the socket.

GRAHAM

He didn't scream or anything.  His

arm just flopped to his side and he

got real still.

MERRILL

They're coming.

GRAHAM

I held him in my lap in the back

seat as we drove to the hospital.

I couldn't stop crying... We need

to go into the basement now.

GRAHAM

You know what your Uncle Merrill

did right after the doctor put his

arm back in place?  He jumped off

the table and gave me a hug.  He

had already forgotten that I was

the one who hurt him.

MERRILL

We won't be able to get out of

there.

GRAHAM

I'm sorry I hurt your arm.

MERRILL

I know.

CUT TO:

MORGAN

We forgot our foil helmets!

GRAHAM

We need something to wedge against

the doorknob.

MORGAN

They'll read our minds!

GRAHAM

You're scaring your sister.

BO

I'm already scared.

GRAHAM

Merrill --

MERRILL

I'm looking!

MORGAN

(to himself)

They'll know our secret thoughts.

GRAHAM

Merrill!

MERRILL

Got it!

BO

Dad!

GRAHAM

Where's Bo?

BO

I'm okay.

MERRILL

What's happening out there?

GRAHAM

(in the dark)

I can't even imagine.

MORGAN

I hope they're doing better than we

are.  We don't even have helmets.

GRAHAM

They're just making noises.

They're not trying to get in.

(beat)

Why are they doing that?

MERRILL

They want our attention on the

door?

GRAHAM

They're distracting us?

MERRILL

From what?

MORGAN

The book says they're probably very

good problem solvers.

MERRILL

What book!

MORGAN

They'll find a way in.

GRAHAM

Morgan, give me your flashlight.

GRAHAM

Is there an air vent in here?

GRAHAM

I can feel air.

MERRILL

Me too.

GRAHAM

It's getting stronger.

MERRILL

I'm close.

MORGAN

What?

MERRILL (O.S.)

Hold the vent!

GRAHAM

Pull him!

GRAHAM

We don't have his medicine.

GRAHAM

Don't be scared Morgan.  We'll slow

it down together.  Feel my chest.

Feel it going in and out.  Breathe

like me.  Breathe like me.

BO

He can't breathe.

GRAHAM

Stay with me.  Stay with me.  I

know it hurts.  Be strong baby...

It'll pass.

GRAHAM

Don't do this to me again.  Not

again.

GRAHAM

I hate you.  I hate you...

GRAHAM

The fear is feeding it... Don't be

afraid of what's happening...

Believe it's going to pass...

Believe it... Just wait... Don't be

afraid... The air is coming...

Believe... We don't have to be

afraid... It's about to pass...

Here it comes... Don't be afraid...

Here comes the air...

GRAHAM

There we go... We don't have to be

scared at all... We know it'll

pass.  We believe it... Don't be

afraid Morgan.

GRAHAM

Feel my chest... Breathe with me.

Together... The air is going in our

lungs... Together... We're the

same.  We're the same.

GRAHAM

I hate you.

MERRILL

I should save the flashlights.

It came on about two hours ago.

Woke me up.

We won Graham.

MERRILL

It went on all night.  Everywhere.

It was completely a ground battle.

Mostly hand to hand.  You can't see

them unless you're up close.  A lot

of people died.  Some from combat.

But most from poison gas

inhalation.  They secrete it.

GRAHAM

How many died?

MERRILL

They think over a hundred thousand.

They're just estimates.

But we held strong.

How do they know it's over?

MERRILL

A mass evacuation by them started

about eight o'clock this morning.

It's eleven now.

You didn't think we'd make it.

Listen, there's things I can take

of them I can't take, is when my

older brother --

starts losing faith in things.  I

saw your eyes last night.

(beat)

I don't want to ever see your eyes

like that again, okay?  I'm

serious.

GRAHAM

(soft)

Okay.

MERRILL

He's been like that for awhile.  We

need to get him some medicine.

GRAHAM

Have they said anything about our

area?

MERRILL

Philadelphia and its outlying

counties are cleared, but who knows

for sure?

GRAHAM

(whispers)

He's not strong enough to fight off

another attack.

MERRILL

Yes... That's the first thing

Pinned?  What does that mean?

OFFICER PASKI

The truck... the truck has severed

most of her lower half.

GRAHAM

What did you say?

OFFICER PASKI

She won't be saved.  At this point

she's alive, because the truck is

holding her together.  She doesn't

feel much, and she's talking almost

like normal.  We didn't pull the

truck out, cause we wanted you to

come down here to be with her, as
