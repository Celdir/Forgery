Shooting Draft

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

Mrs. Dee, this is Frank Galvin -- a

very good friend of ours, and a very

fine attorney.

GALVIN

It's a shame about your husband,

Mrs. Dee.

GALVIN

I knew him vaguely through the Lodge.

He was a wonderful man.

(shakes head in

sympathy)

It was a crime what happened to him.

A crime. If there's anything that I

could do to help...

GALVIN

(thoughtfully realizes

he is usurping her

time)

Well...

SON

(of the card)

What is that...?

GALVIN

I...

SON

What the hell is that...

GALVIN

...I was a friend of your fa...

SON

You never knew my father.

(hits card out of

Galvin's hand)

You get out of here, who the hell do

you think you are...

GALVIN

(to Funeral Manager)

I'm talking to this man...

FUNERAL MANAGER

Excuse me, Mrs. Cleary...

SON

Who the hell do you think you are?

FUNERAL MANAGER

I don't want you coming back here.

Ever. Do you understand?

GALVIN

I was just talking to...

FUNERAL MANAGER

Those are bereaved people in there.

GALVIN

Pat says, 'Mike... there's a new

bar, you go in, for a half a buck

you get a beer, a free lunch, and

then take you in the back room and

they get you laid.'

JIMMY

Another, Frank...?

GALVIN

(gestures to include

group)

...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you

mean to tell me for a buck you get a

free lunch and a beer, and then you

go in the back and get laid?' 'That's

correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you

been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No,

but my sister has...'

(gestures to Jimmy)

Everyone. Buy yourself one too.

MICKEY

(harshly)

Get up.

(beat, more harshly)

Get up.

GALVIN

Hi, Mickey...

MICKEY

What the hell do you think you're

doing...?

(surveys the wrecked

office)

What's going on here...?

GALVIN

Uh...

MICKEY

Fuck you. I got a call today from

Sally Doneghy...

GALVIN

...now who is that...?

MICKEY

...You're 'sposed to be in court in

ten days and she's telling me you

haven't even met with them...

GALVIN

Sally Doneghy, now who is that?

MICKEY

One lousy letter eighteen months

ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case

your way...

GALVIN

...hey, I don't need your charity...

MICKEY

...I get these people to trust you --

they're coming here tomorrow by the

way -- I get this expert doctor to

talk to you. I'm doing all your

fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen

months. You're 'sposed to be in court.

I bet you haven't even seen the file.

GALVIN

Hey, what are you, my nanny?

MICKEY

Listen to me. Listen to me... listen

to me, Frank, 'cause I'm done fuckin'

with you. I can't do it any more.

Look around you: You think that you're

going to change? What's going to

change it? You think it's going to

be different next month? It's going

to be the same. And I have to stop.

This is it. I got you a good case,

it's a moneymaker. You do it right

and it will take care of you. But

I'm through. I'm sorry, Frank, this

is the end.

(beat)

Life is too short, and I'm too old.

(beat)

GALVIN

I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank

Galvin... why didn't you go in?

SALLY

It's locked.

GALVIN

(astonished)

It's locked?

GALVIN

I'm terribly sorry... I hope we didn't

put you out. Won't you come in...?

(motions Sally into

inner office, gestures

with note)

I'd offer you some coffee, but it

looks like my girl just went out.

GALVIN

It's not a good case. It's a very

good case.

GALVIN

A healthy young woman goes into the

hospital to deliver her third child,

she's given the wrong anesthetic...

SALLY

...we, we love her, Dick and me...

GALVIN

...I'm sure you do...

SALLY

But what can we do? She don't know

who's visiting her...

GALVIN

...I know. I went...

SALLY

...You saw her?

GALVIN

Yes. Yes, I have.

SALLY

You know how beautiful she was?

(beat)

Her husband left her, and he took

her kids... They, they, they'd let

you die in there. They don't care.

Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the

Chronic Care... in Arlington...?

They'd take her in. Perpetual care.

They'd take her. Fifty thousand

dollars they want. An endowment.

GALVIN

...fifty thousand dollars?

SALLY

I don't want to leave her. Dick...

the, the... and Father Laughlin, he

said that it was God's will...

GALVIN

...I understand...

SALLY

My doctor told me that I got to move

out West... that's when we filed in

court. We didn't want to sue...

GALVIN

...I understand...

SALLY

...But Dick, he's looking for two

years in Tucson... and they called

him up and said to come out. He's a

good man. He's only trying to do

what's right.

SALLY

This is my husband.

GALVIN

Please sit down. I told your wife.

I'm sorry that we have to meet out

here. I've got a case coming in two

days in the Superior Court and my

office is a mess of papers.

DONEGHY

...that's all right.

GALVIN

I was telling your wife, we have a

very good case here.

SALLY

He saw her at the Northern Care...

GALVIN

...and I have inquiries out to

doctors, experts in the field...

there is, of course, a problem getting

a doctor to testify that another

doctor's negligent...

DONEGHY

...the Archdiocese called up, they

said who was our attorney, 'cause

the case is coming to trial...

GALVIN

I doubt we'll have to go to trial...

DONEGHY

...we told them we didn't want it to

come out this way.

GALVIN

I completely understand...

DONEGHY

We just...

SALLY

We just can't do it anymore.

(beat)

This is our chance to get away.

GALVIN

I'm going to see you get that chance.

DONEGHY

What is this going to cost?

GALVIN

It's completely done on a contingency

basis. That means whatever the

settlement is I retain one-third...

that is, of course, the usual

arrangement...

ALITO (V.O.)

His name is Frank Galvin. B.U. Law,

class of 'fifty-two. Second in his

class. Editor of the Law Review.

Worked with Mickey Morrissey twelve

years. Criminal Law and Personal

Injury...'

ALITO

'Married Patricia Harrington, nineteen

sixty...'

ALITO

'Joined Stearns, Harrington, Pierce

nineteen sixty as a full partner.

Resigned the firm nineteen sixt-ynine

over the Lillibridge case...' Do

you...?

BISHOP

He was accused of jury tampering.

ALITO

Accused. Not indicted. He resigned

the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy.

Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey

until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-

eight. Since then he's been on his

own. Four cases before the Circuit

Court. He lost them all. He drinks.

BISHOP

Four cases in three years...

ALITO

The man's an ambulance chaser...

BISHOP

...tell me about this case.

ALITO

This is a nuisance suit. He's looking

for small change. He's asking for

six hundred thousand and betting we

don't want to go to court.

BISHOP

No -- we don't want this case in

court.

ALITO

Neither does he. That's where he

loses. This man's scared to death to

go to court. We only have to call

his bluff.

BISHOP

I want to settle this thing and be

done with it. I don't want the

Archdiocese exposed.

ALITO

No. Absolutely, and we're going to

see that it is not.

BISHOP

So what I want to do is stop it here.

I'm going to make him an offer. I

want to do it myself. I want it to

come from me.

ALITO

All right. But let's keep the price

down. I've called Ed Concannon. He

recommends that we continue to respond

as if we're going to trial.

BISHOP

If we were to go to trial, would we

win the case?

ALITO

Well, of course, it's always

dangerous...

BISHOP

I know that answer. If we went to

trial would we win?

ALITO

(in an "of course"

tone)

Yes.

CLAIRE

(to phone)

Thank you very much.

GALVIN

What are you doing here?

CLAIRE

Mickey told me to come back to work.

CLAIRE

...here's your mail, call Mrs.

Doneghy...

GALVIN

...yes. Get her on the phone...

CLAIRE

...that was a Dr. David Gruber's

office...

GALVIN

(putting down books)

Gruber...

CLAIRE

Mickey told him to call.

(reading from notes)

'He's some very hotshot surgeon at

Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet

with you at seven tonight re testimony

in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You

meet him at the hospital.'

GALVIN

(surprised)

...he wants to testify...?

CLAIRE

It looks that way.

GALVIN

You know what that would mean?

GALVIN

To get somebody from a Boston hospital

to say he'll testify?

CLAIRE

...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told

you that.

GALVIN

(delighted)

This is going to drive the ante up.

CLAIRE

(into phone)

Frank Galvin's... who's calling

please? Bishop Brophy's office...

CLAIRE

I'm sorry, he's not in... may I take

a mess... tomorrow when, two

o'clock... I'll check my book...

CLAIRE

Yes. Mr. Galvin's clear at that

time... the Bishop's office, tomorrow,

the fifth at two p.m. Thank you...

GALVIN

That's the call that I'm waiting

for.

CLAIRE

What does it mean?

GALVIN

They want to settle.

(beat)

It means a lot of money.

CLAIRE

Does that mean I'm back for awhile?

GALVIN

Dr. Gruber...?

GALVIN

Dr. Gruber...

GRUBER

(turning)

Yes? Galvin, right?

GALVIN

I appreciate -- a man as busy as --

GRUBER

That's perfectly all right. I'm kind

of rushed. Do you mind if we walk

while we talk?

GRUBER

I read the hospital report on your

client.

GALVIN

...Deborah Ann Kaye...

GRUBER

...Deborah Ann Kaye...

GALVIN

They called, they're going to settle,

what I want to do is build up as

much...

GRUBER

Right. Who called?

GALVIN

The Archdiocese called, they want to

settle... her estate...

GRUBER

...and you're going to do that?

GALVIN

(surprised, of course)

Yes.

GRUBER

You're going to settle out of court?

GALVIN

Yes.

GRUBER

Why?

GALVIN

(it's a meaningless

question to him, as

if to a child)

Uh... in the, well, in the interests

of her family... you, Dr. Gruber,

you know, you can never tell what a

jury is going to do. St. Catherine's

a very well thought of institution.

Her doctors...

GRUBER

(glances at watch,

impatient)

Her doctors killed her.

GALVIN

(a beat)

I'm sorry...?

GRUBER

Her doctors murdered her. They gave

her the wrong anesthetic and they

put her in the hospital for life.

(a beat)

Her doctors murdered her.

GALVIN

Do you know who her doctors were?

GRUBER

I read the file. Yeah. Marx and

Towler. I know who they were.

GALVIN

The most respected...

GRUBER

(smiling)

Whose side are you arguing...? I

thought that you wanted to do

something. I don't have any interest

in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense,

but we all know where the money's

going to... I have an interest in

the Hospital; and I don't want those

bozos working in the same shop as

me. They gave her the wrong

anesthetic. They turned the girl

into a vegetable. They killed her

and they killed her kid. You caught

'em. Now: how many others did they

kill?

GRUBER

You want a cigar?

GALVIN

The hospital is owned by the

Archdioceses of...

GRUBER

What are they going to do? Not invite

me to their Birthday party...?

(checks watch)

Look, I gotta go. I have to be in

Cambridge...

GALVIN

Well, well, when can we meet again.

GRUBER

Okay. I'll meet you here. Tuesday

night... I gotta go. You going my

way?

GALVIN

We have to... we... we have to keep

you under wraps. Please don't, don't

discuss...

GRUBER

I understand.

GALVIN

...the case with anyone. And I'll

meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over

your testimony...

GRUBER

Right. Seven o'clock. Here.

GALVIN

Thank you...

GRUBER

...that's perfectly all right.

GALVIN

(beat)

Uh, why, why are you doing this?

GRUBER

(thinks a second)

To do right. Isn't that why you're

doing it?

GALVIN

I want to buy you a drink.

JIMMY (THE BARTENDER)

Thanks, Franky.

GALVIN

Would you like a drink?

WOMAN

I'd like an apartment.

GALVIN

Settle for a drink?

WOMAN

No. Thank you.

GALVIN

I had a very good day today.

WOMAN

(beat, smiles, downs

drink, gets up off

the stool, sincerely)

I'm glad you did. Thank you. Good

night.

GALVIN

You're very welcome.

GALVIN

Well, well, well. Huh?

JIMMY

Yeah.

GALVIN

(sighs)

It's a long road that has no turning.

JIMMY

That's for sure, Frank.

GALVIN

I'm going to the Archdiocese tomorrow

at two. I know you don't. I know you

don't... no, you're just following

your life. You have a life too...

you have to move out West. It doesn't

help you to stay here. Well... I'm

sure she knows you care for her.

GALVIN

(voice over; on phone)

Well. Well. Well. Finally we're none

of us protected... we... we just

have to go on. To seek help where we

can... and go on... I know that you

love her... I know you're acting out

of love.

GALVIN

(into phone)

As soon as I know... you give him my

respects too. Not at all. Not at

all... Good night.

(beat)

Well, bless you, too. Good night.

IRISH NURSE #1 (V.O.)

Jimmy, I said, don't you go in your

pocket if there's nothing there...

IRISH NURSE #2 (V.O.)

...and what did he say...?

IRISH NURSE #1 (V.O.)

(spies Galvin, her

tone changes)

...Sir, you aren't allowed to be in

here...

NURSE

You can't be in here.

GALVIN

(as if remembering

something, simply)

I'm her attorney.

BISHOP

It's a question of continuing values.

St. Catherine's -- to do the good

that she must do in the community

has to maintain the position that

she holds in the community. So we

have a question of balance. On the

one hand, the reputation, and, so,

the effectiveness of our hospital,

and two of her important doctors --

and, on the other hand, the rights

of your client.

BISHOP

A young woman. In her prime...

deprived of...

(searches for a word)

...life... sight... her family...

It's tragic. It's a tragic accident.

BISHOP

...nothing, of course, can begin to

make it right. But we must do what

we can. We must do all that we can.

BISHOP

Yes. We must try to make it right.

BISHOP

It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...

(beat)

...nothing can make the woman well...

but we try to compensate... to make

a gesture...

GALVIN

How did you settle on the amount?

BISHOP

We thought it was just.

GALVIN

You thought it was just.

BISHOP

Yes.

GALVIN

Because it struck me how neatly

'three' went into the amount. Two

Hundred Ten Thousand. That would

mean I keep seventy.

BISHOP

That was our insurance company's

recommendation.

GALVIN

Yes. It would be.

BISHOP

Nothing that we can do can make that

woman well.

GALVIN

And no one will know the truth.

BISHOP

What is the truth?

GALVIN

That that poor girl put her trust in

the hands of two men who took her

life, she's in a coma, her life is

gone. She has no family, she has no

home, she's tied to a machine, she

has no friends -- and the people who

should care for her: her Doctors,

and you, and me, have been bought

off to look the other way. We have

been paid to look the other way. I

came in here to take your money.

(beat)

I brought snapshots to show you. So

I could get your money.

(to Young Priest,

waving away document)

I can't take it. If I take it. If I

take that money I'm lost. I'm just

going to be a rich ambulance chaser.

(beat; pleading for

understanding)

I can't do it. I can't take it.

YOUNG PRIEST

If we may discuss money, Mr. Galvin.

How is your law practice?

GALVIN

It's not too good. I've only got one

client.

GALVIN

I have to talk to you.

MICKEY

What do you want?

GALVIN

(dragging him up)

Come on. Let's get a drink.

MICKEY

(sighs, to partner)

Don't touch anything.

MICKEY

(enraged)

Are you out of your mind...?

GALVIN

...I'm going to need your help...

MICKEY

You need my help...? You need a

goddamn keeper... are you telling me

that you turned down two-hundred-ten

grand?

(beat)

Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you

nuts. What are you going to do, bring

her back to life?

GALVIN

I'm going to help her.

MICKEY

To do what...? To do what, for

chrissake...? To help her to do what?

She's dead...

GALVIN

They killed her. And they're trying

to buy it...

MICKEY

That's the point, you stupid fuck.

Let them buy it. We let them buy the

case. That's what I took it for. You

let this drop -- we'll go up to New

Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...

GALVIN

Mick. Mick. Mick...

MICKEY

What?

GALVIN

You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if

not now, when...'

MICKEY

I know what I said but not now. You

won it. Franky. You won it. When

they give you the money, that means

that you won. We don't want to go to

court -- is this getting to you...?

GALVIN

...he's a good man...

MICKEY

...he's a good man...? He's the Prince

of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have

people in there testifying that the

broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday

on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't

fuck with this case.

GALVIN

...I have to stand up for her...

MICKEY

Frank, but not now. Frank. You're

trying to wipe out some old business.

But not now. I understand. But you

go call 'em back. You call the Bishop

back.

GALVIN

I have to try this case. I have to

do it, Mick. I've got to stand up

for that girl. I need your help.

(beat)

Mick, will you help me...?

(beat)

Will you help me...?

CONCANNON

(smiling)

Anybody ever hear, 'For want of a

shoe a horse was lost?' Who's going

on vacation tomorrow?

CONCANNON

Friedman. St. Barts. is that right?

FRIEDMAN

Yessir.

CONCANNON

(to secretary taking

notes at the side of

the room)

Send Mrs. Friedman a dozen roses

tomorrow morning please, Sal. I tell

you what, send her a sunlamp.

(smiles, there is

laughter from the

room; to Friedman,

sympathetic)

I'm sorry, but you'll have to stay.

No vacations till this thing is

cleared.

CONCANNON

Our court date is January twelfth.

You're all acquainted with this case.

It's been scheduled for eighteen

months. We have the attorney for the

Plaintiff, Frank Galvin -- and I

trust you are all familiar with his

record -- and we have been expecting

him to call us to negotiate. As he

did not, and five days before we're

supposed to go to court we made him

a rather generous offer, which he

refused. Five days before the trial.

What does this mean? I want to find

out.

(writes on the

blackboard, "1)

Research")

(writes "2) Homework")

Acquaint yourselves again with the

depositions. Don't rely on the fact

that we did it last year. Do it again.

We're going to review them here, and

you do it at home. You each have a

full file. Know the deps, and I want

you all to be here when we work with

the defendants... when is that,

Billy...?

YOUNG LAWYER (BILLY)

Tuesday evening, Sir.

CONCANNON

I want an article in the Globe As

Soon As Possible, 'St. Cat's...

Neighborhood Giant serving the

community' etc. We've got it in the

files. I want something in Monday's

Herald: 'Our Gallant Doctors,'

something... Be inventive, I want

television...

(nods toward one of

the young lawyers)

...talk to our man at GBH. And to

belabor the obvious for a moment...

(beat)

Our clients are: the Archdiocese of

Boston; St. Catherine Laboure

Hospital, and Drs. Marx and Towler,

two of the most respected men in

their profession. The thrust of this

defense will be to answer in court,

in the press and in the public mind --

to answer the accusation of negligence

this completely: not only that we

win the case, but that we win the

case so that it's seen that the attack

on these men and this institution

was a rank obscenity.

(beat)

All right. Let's get the cobwebs

off. Billy...?

YOUNG LAWYER

Please turn to your Page Four.

YOUNG LAWYER

We're going to start with a review

of the depositions of the Operating

Room Team: the nurse-anesthetist,

the scrub-nurse, the...

MICKEY

Who have we got?

GALVIN

We've got her sister. Testifies she

had a meal one hour before she was

admitted to the hospital. This is

the point.

MICKEY

You got the admittance form says

patient ate nine hours prior to

admittance.

GALVIN

Admittance form is wrong.

MICKEY

Forget it. You can't prove it.

Sister's testimony is no good. Jury

knows we win she gets the cash.

GALVIN

I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her

heart condition means they gave her

the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus

she came in complaining of stomach

pains...

MICKEY

(conceding)

...Gruber's not bad.

GALVIN

Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare,

the jury's going to love him, Mick...

And you calm down, all right? Their

guy, Towler's, the author of the

book,

(hunts for book on

desk, holds it up;

reads)

'Methodology and Practice,

Anesthesiology.'

(rummages through a

pile of papers on

the desk)

...and they got depositions from the

nurses, everybody in the operating

room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these

guys are God. I saw them walk on

water...'

(checking a list)

They had an obstetrical nurse in

there. We got a deposition from the

obstetrical nurse?

MICKEY

(checking list)

No.

GALVIN

(reading from pad)

'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in

Arlington, still working at the

hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow?

How come she isn't speaking up.

MICKEY

Right.

GALVIN

Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State

of Michigan.

MICKEY

Right.

GALVIN

Brindisi versus Electric Boat.

MICKEY

You got a good memory, Franky.

GALVIN

I had a good teacher. McLean versus

Urban Transport...

GALVIN

Jimmy? Bushmills.

(turns to Mickey,

whispers)

Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you

a drink tomorrow.

MICKEY

Yeah? And what are you going to do

tonight?

GALVIN

I'm going to get laid.

MICKEY

Don't leave your best work in the

sheets.

GALVIN

D'you find an apartment?

LAURA

Still looking.

GALVIN

I changed my life today. What did

you do?

LAURA

I changed my room at the Hotel.

GALVIN

Why?

LAURA

The TV didn't work.

GALVIN

What Hotel are you staying at?

LAURA

And what are you? A cop?

GALVIN

I'm a lawyer.

LAURA

My ex-husband was a lawyer.

GALVIN

Really. How wonderful for you.

LAURA

Yes. It was, actually.

GALVIN

Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you

call it off?

LAURA

Who says I'm the one that called it

off?

GALVIN

A brick house says you divorced him.

I'll put you on your honor. Bet you

a hundred dollars against you join

me for dinner. And I'll take your

word for it. Now you tell me the

truth. Because you cannot lie to me.

What's your name?

LAURA

Laura.

GALVIN

My name's Frank. And furthermore,

you came back to see me tonight.

LAURA

What if it wasn't you that I came

back to see?

GALVIN

You just got lucky.

(gets up off stool)

D'you eat yet? Come on.

GALVIN

Jesus, you are one beautiful woman.

GALVIN

The weak, the weak have got to have

somebody to fight for them. Isn't

that the truth? You want another

drink?

LAURA

I think I will.

GALVIN

Jimmy!

(beat)

That's why the court exists. The

court doesn't exist to give them

justice, eh? But to give them a chance

at justice.

LAURA

And are they going to get it?

GALVIN

They might. Yes. That's the point...

is that they might... you see, the

jury wants to believe. They're all

cynics, sure, because they want to

believe. I have to go in there

tomorrow to find twelve people to

hear this case. I'm going to see a

hundred people and pick twelve. And

every one of them it's written on

their face, 'This is a sham. There

is no justice...' but in their heart

they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'

LAURA

Maybe what?

GALVIN

(beat)

Maybe I can do something right.

LAURA

And is that what you're going to do?

(a beat)

Is that what you're going to do...?

GALVIN

That's what I'm going to try to do.

LAURA

That's all right.

JUDGE (V.O.)

You're late, Mr. Galvin.

GALVIN

Yessir. I'm sorry.

JUDGE

Why is that?

GALVIN

I was held up.

CONCANNON

Ed Concannon.

GALVIN

(shaking his head)

Frank Galvin. We've met before.

JUDGE

Let's do some business.

JUDGE (V.O.)

They tell me that no bargain ever

was completed other than quickly

when both parties really cared to

make a deal.

JUDGE

Now, have you boys tried to resolve

your little difficulty because that

certainly would save the Commonwealth

a lot of time and bother.

GALVIN

This is a complicated case, your

Honor...

JUDGE

I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me

tell you something. If we find it so

complex, how in the hell you think

you're going to make a jury understand

it?

(smiles at Galvin)

See my point? Let's talk a minute.

Frank: what will you and your client

take right now this very minute to

walk out of here and let this damn

thing drop?

GALVIN

My client can't walk, your Honor.

JUDGE

I know full well she can't, Frank.

You see the Padre on your way out

and he'll punch your ticket. You

follow me? I'm trying to help you.

CONCANNON

Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the

Archdiocese have offered plaintiff

two hundred and ten thousand dollars.

JUDGE

Huh!

CONCANNON

My doctors didn't want a settlement

at any price. They wanted this cleared

up in court. They want their

vindication. I agree with them. But

for today the offer stands. Before

we begin the publicity of a trial.

For today only.

(beat)

When I walk out that door the offer

is withdrawn.

(turns to Galvin)

As long as you understand that.

(beat)

It's got to be that way.

GALVIN

We are going to try the case.

JUDGE

(incredulous)

That's it...?

(beat)

Come on, guys... life is too short...

(beat)

You tell me if you're playing

'chicken,' or you mean it.

(beat; turns to Galvin)

Frank: I don't think I'm talking out

of school, but I just heard someone

offer you two hundred grand... and

that's a lot of money... and if I

may say, you haven't got the best of

records.

GALVIN

...things change.

JUDGE

...that's true. Sometimes they change,

sometimes they don't. Now, I remember

back to when you were disbarred...

GALVIN

I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the

pro...

JUDGE

And it seems to me, a fella's trying

to come back, he'd take this

settlement, and get a record for

himself.

(beat)

I myself would take it and run like

a thief.

GALVIN

I'm sure you would.

JUDGE

Hm.

(beat; checking book)

We have the date set? Next Thursday.

Good.

(smiles)

See you boys in court.

GALVIN

Mr. Abraham...

ABRAMS

Abrams...

GALVIN

Abrams. Yes. How are you today?

ABRAMS

I'm fine.

GALVIN

Good.

(beat)

You ever been inside a hospital?

ABRAMS

Yes.

GALVIN

Ah. How did they treat you?

ABRAMS

I don't know what you mean.

MICKEY

Been a long time, huh...?

GALVIN

I'm getting it back. Don't worry

about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find

the obstetric nurse?

MICKEY

Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I

tried her at the hospital. I'm going

to try her back at home. Read this.

GALVIN

So what?

MICKEY

So what...? The best is yet to come.

Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr.

Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday:

'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'

GALVIN

They still have to take it to a jury.

MICKEY

What I'm saying, they're getting

some help.

GALVIN

(looks annoyed)

So what do you want me to do?

Concannon's going to try the case

his way, I'm going to try it mine.

You want me to go wee wee wee all

the time because he's got some flack,

got stories in the newspaper. I'm

going to win this case.

MICKEY

John: gimme a cuesta-ray.

GALVIN

Oh shit, what's today?

MICKEY

Today is Tuesday. What?

GALVIN

I've got to go see Gruber.

(to Cigar Stand

Operator)

What's the best cigars you have?

MICKEY

Give 'em a box of Macanudos.

GALVIN

Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody

at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.

JOHN

Here you are, Franky.

GALVIN

(takes box)

Thanks. Can you go over and meet

her...? Tell her I'll stop by when

I'm through... Laura Fischer...

MICKEY

Sure. Who is she?

JOHN

That's thirty-three bucks. Can you

believe that...?

MICKEY

Oh, yeah. Your broad from last night.

JOHN

Thanks, Franky.

GALVIN

Tell her that I'll meet her there,

okay? See you tomorrow in the office.

GALVIN

We're doing fine.

DONEGHY

You said you're gonna call me up.

You didn't call me up. Who do you

think you are?

(pushes Galvin into a

wall; advances; pushes

him again)

Who do you think you are...?

GALVIN

Hold on a second.

DONEGHY

I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm

going to have your ticket. You know

what you did? Do you know what you

did?

GALVIN

It's all right, Mickey.

DONEGHY

You ruined my life, Mister... Me and

my wife... and I am going to ruin

yours...

(pushes Galvin again)

You don't have to go out there to

see that girl. We been going four

years.

(beat)

Four years... my wife's been crying

herself to sleep what they, what,

what they did to her sister.

GALVIN

I swear to you I wouldn't have turned

the offer down unless I thought that

I could win the case...

DONEGHY

What you thought!? What you thought...

I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get

my wife out of town, we hired you,

we're paying you, I got to find out

from the other side they offered two

hundred...

GALVIN

I'm going to win this case... Mist...

Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury

with a solid case, a famous doctor

as an expert witness, and I'm going

to win eight hundred thousand dollars.

DONEGHY

You guys, you guys, you're all the

same. The Doctors at the hospital,

you... it's 'What I'm going to do

for you'; but you screw up it's 'We

did the best that we could. I'm

dreadfully sorry...' And people like

me live with your mistakes the rest

of our lives.

GALVIN

If I could accept the offer right

now, I would.

(beat)

They took it back.

DONEGHY

I understand.

(starts to walk away

from Galvin; stops)

I went to the Bar Association. They

tell me you're going to be disbarred.

MICKEY

Franky can't make it. He had an

appointment he forgot, he's going to

see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey,

we're supposed to get to know each

other.

LAURA

How'm I doing so far?

MICKEY

So far you're great. You got a

cigarette?

LAURA

What are you drinking?

(hands him cigarettes,

smiles, calls the

Bartender)

Jimmy...?

GALVIN

Dr. Gruber.

NURSE

Dr. Gruber's not here today, Sir.

GALVIN

No... No...

NURSE

Yes, Sir. He hasn't been in all day...

He's not on the chart...

MAID

What is it?

GALVIN

Dr. Gruber.

MAID

Dr. Gruber's not in.

GALVIN

I had an appointment at his office,

I think I must have got it wrong. We

had a meeting...

MAID

He's not in, Sir.

GALVIN

Where is he?

GALVIN

I... please. My wife... my wife's

prescription has run out. If I can

call him...

MAID

Dr. Halpern's taking all his...

GALVIN

No, no, no. I have to talk to him.

If I can only call him...

MAID

(beat)

He's... you can't reach him, Sir.

He's in the, on some island in the

Caribbean, they don't have a phone.

(beat)

He'll be back in a week...

(beat)

If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...

MICKEY

Stearns, Harrington, you know who

that is?

LAURA

Should I?

MICKEY

A huge law firm. Okay? They put him

in the firm, he's married,

everything's superb. Franky, he's

starting to talk like he comes from

Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place,

'You must drop by with Pat and me...'

Okay...?

LAURA

Yes.

MICKEY

...and he's making a billion dollars

every minute working for Stearns,

Harrington, and he bought a dog, and

everything is rosy.

(beat)

Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a

case.

LAURA

The Big Boy did...?

MICKEY

That Frank was working on. Yeah. He

thought Franky needed some help, so

they bribed a juror. So Franky finds

out. He comes to me in tears. He

thinks that anybody who knows what a

'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I

told him 'Franky, wake up. These

people are sharks. What do you think

they got so rich from? Doing good?'

He can't be comforted. He tells the

boys at Stearns and Harrington they've

disappointed him, he's going to the

Judge to rat them out.

LAURA

Huh.

MICKEY

Before he can get there here comes

this Federal Marshal, and Franky's

indicted for Jury tampering, they

throw him in jail, he's gonna be

disbarred, his life is over.

(beat)

Jimmy, gimme another drink.

(to Laura)

How are you?

LAURA

(to Jimmy)

Me, too.

MICKEY

Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He,

finally, he gets to see the light,

he calls up Harrington, he says he

thinks he made a mistake. As if by

magic, charges against him are

dropped, he's released from jail.

(beat)

P.S. He's fired from the firm, his

wife divorces him, he turns to drink

and mopes around three and a half

years.

(beat)

You like that story?

JUDGE (O.S.)

Yes?

JUDGE

What is it?

GALVIN

Thank you for seeing me.

JUDGE

That's perfectly all right.

GALVIN

I need an extension for my case.

JUDGE

You should have taken their offer.

Especially if you were unprepared.

GALVIN

I had a witness disappear on me.

JUDGE

That happens.

GALVIN

I could subpoena him if I had a week.

JUDGE

I don't have a week. This case never

should have come to trial. You know

better. You're Mr. Independent. You

want to be independent? Be independent

now. I've got no sympathy for you.

VOICE

Continental Casualty...

GALVIN

Mr. Alito, please.

VOICE

Business hours are over, Sir. This

is the switch...

GALVIN

I have to reach him. This is an

emergency. Could you give me his

home number?

VOICE

I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...

GALVIN

...Would you, would you call him up.

I'll give you my number, and ask

him...

VOICE

I can't guarantee that...

GALVIN

I understand. Thank you, my name is

Galvin. I'll be at the following

number in a half an hour. It's urgent.

GALVIN

(into phone)

Hello. Yes. Thank you for calling.

Frank Galvin... I'm representing

Deborah Ann Kaye...? I'd like to

discuss your firm's offer of the two

hundred th... In the sense that I

feel that we'd like to accept it.

(beat)

Well, it's rather a shock to me,

too; but it's my client's wishes...

She's changed her mind as of this

evening... I must say that I tried

to dissuade her...

GALVIN

...Well, she, on the eve of the

case... You understand... I think

quite frankly she's come down with

nerves and she'd like...

GALVIN

When was that arrived at...?

(beat)

I, I know what Mr. Concannon said,

but... I... Well, I think you're

making a mistake... I think that you

should reconsider; why don't you

check with your principals, and I'll

call you in the...

(beat)

No?... you... uh. All right. No.

That's fine. I understand. Sorry to

bother you at home.

MICKEY

What happened...?

MICKEY

What happened, Joey...?

GALVIN

I can't talk now.

MICKEY

D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?

GALVIN

Concannon got to my witness.

(beat; to himself)

I can't breathe in here...

(into phone)

Hello Doctor...?

(checks sheet)

Dr. Thompson. This is Joseph Galvin,

attorney for a Deborah Ann Kaye, we

had some correspondence some time

ago...? That's right. I'm sorry that

we never got back, the case was

postponed, and I've had a changeover

in staff... I'm sorry to call you so

late...

GALVIN (V.O.)

...but we have had a change of

strategy, and we were wondering, I

know this is short notice, but...

LAURA

Would you like me to leave...?

(beat)

Is this a bad time -- ?

GALVIN

(distracted)

What...?

LAURA

Is this a bad time.

GALVIN

We, we... No... we just had a small

reversal in the case...

(beat)

I have some, uh... I have some work

to do...

LAURA

What happened...?

GALVIN

They, uh, they got to my witness.

LAURA

...and is that serious?

GALVIN

I've got to work...

LAURA

Do you want me to go...?

GALVIN

No, no, I'm just...

LAURA

Why don't you get some rest?

GALVIN

I've got to work.

LAURA

You can't work if you can't think.

You get in bed. It's all right. I'll

stay here with you. It's all right.

Come on...

GALVIN

You're going to stay here...?

LAURA

Yes.

GALVIN

I'm only going to rest a little while.

CONCANNON (V.O.)

What is your name, please?

TOWLER

Dr. Robert Towler.

CONCANNON (V.O.)

You were Deborah Ann Kaye's doctor...?

DR. TOWLER

No, actually, she was referred to

me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...

CONCANNON

Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just

tell the truth.

CONCANNON

Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear

that. You were her doctor.

DR. TOWLER

Yes.

CONCANNON

Say it.

DR. TOWLER

I was her doctor.

CONCANNON

You were the anesthesiologist at her

delivery May twelfth, nineteen

seventy...

DR. TOWLER

...I was one of a group of...

CONCANNON

Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep

those answers to three words. You

weren't 'part of a group,' you were

her anesthesiologist. Isn't that

right?

DR. TOWLER

Yes.

CONCANNON

You were there to help Dr. Marx

deliver her baby. Were you not?

DR. TOWLER

Yes.

CONCANNON

Anything special about the case?

DR. TOWLER

When she...

CONCANNON

(to Dr. Towler,

correcting him)

When 'Debby'...

(to Young Lawyer)

Thank you.

DR. TOWLER

Thank you. When Debby...

CONCANNON

(switching his tack)

Dr. Towler, who was in the operating

room with you?

DR. TOWLER

Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.

Marx, of course...

DR. TOWLER

Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...

CONCANNON

What did these people do when her

heart stopped?

DR. TOWLER

We went to Code Blue...

CONCANNON

'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?

DR. TOWLER

It's a common medical expression,

it's a crash program to restore the

heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in

her trachea, to get her oxygen, her

and the baby... Ms. Nevins...

CONCANNON

Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?

DR. TOWLER

Well, many reasons, actually...

CONCANNON

Tell me one?

DR. TOWLER

She'd aspirated vomitus into her

mask...

CONCANNON

She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut

the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP

IN HER MASK.

DR. TOWLER

She threw up in her mask.

CONCANNON

...and her heart stopped and she

wasn't getting oxygen.

DR. TOWLER

That's right.

CONCANNON

And what did your team do...

DR. TOWLER

Well, we...

CONCANNON

...You brought thirty years of medical

experience to bear. Isn't that what

you did?

DR. TOWLER

Yes.

CONCANNON

...A patient riddled with

complications, questionable

information on her, on her admitting

form...

DR. TOWLER

...We did everything we could...

CONCANNON

...to save her and to save the baby.

Is that...

DR. TOWLER

Yes!

CONCANNON

You reached down into death. Now,

isn't that right?

DR. TOWLER

(getting overcome)

My God, we tried to save her... You

can't know... You can't know...

CONCANNON

(changing tactics;

soothing)

Tell us.

DR. THOMPSON

Mr. Galvin?

GALVIN

Dr. Thompson...?

DR. THOMPSON

It was good of you to meet...

GALVIN

Thank you for coming.

GALVIN

I have some errands to run, and then

I thought we'd spend the evening...

DR. THOMPSON

(nodding)

That's what I'd planned to...

GALVIN

I'm going to take you to the home to

see the girl...

DR. THOMPSON

(tapping his briefcase,

referring to his

files)

From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you

have a very good case...

GALVIN

(distracted; thinking

ahead)

Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll

be comfortable. I'm putting you up

at my...

DR. THOMPSON

...I made a reservation at...

GALVIN

...apartment.

(stops)

No, no. Please. You don't know who

we're dealing with, I, please believe

me, they...

DR. THOMPSON

...What difference would...

GALVIN

These people play very rough. They

don't want to lose this case. There's

a lot of pressure they can bring to

bear, I...

DR. THOMPSON

(smiles)

There's nothing they can do to me.

GALVIN

Please, Sir. Please. Humor me.

GALVIN

We'll spend the evening together,

I'll put you up, you'll be very

comfortable. Please.

(hands Dr. Thompson

an envelope)

That's my address. The key is in it.

(leans forward to

cabbie)

1225 Commonwealth.

(to Dr. Thompson)

Treat the place as your own. Please

don't tell anyone you're here, I'll

see you this evening. Thank you, and

thank you for coming.

VOICE

(Claire, on phone)

Mr. Galvin's...

GALVIN

Let me talk to Mickey.

MICKEY

(on phone)

Yeah? How's our new witness?

GALVIN

D'you find the obstetric nurse?

MICKEY

She's workin' the late shift at the

Hospital. She's at home now, I'm

going over there to talk to...

GALVIN

Gimme the address. I'm gonna go.

We're going to need her.

GALVIN

I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing

Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St.

Catherine Laboure.

MARY ROONEY

I told the guy I didn't want to talk

to...

GALVIN

I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann

Kaye. You know what I'm talking about.

The case is going to trial. Our chief

witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you

know who he is?

MARY ROONEY

No.

GALVIN

He's the Assistant Chief of

Anesthesiology, Massachusetts

Commonwealth. He says your doctors,

Towler and Marx, put my girl in the

hospital for life. And we can prove

that. What we don't know is why.

What went on in there? In the O.R.

That's what we'd like to know.

Something went wrong. And you know

what it was. They gave her the wrong

anesthetic. What happened? The phone

rang... someone got distracted...

what?

MARY ROONEY

...you got your doctor's testimony.

Why do you need me?

GALVIN

I want someone who was in the O.R.

We're going to win the case, there's

no question of that. It's just a

matter of how big...

MARY ROONEY

I've got nothing to say to you.

GALVIN

You know what happened.

MARY ROONEY

Nothing happened.

GALVIN

Then why aren't you testifying for

their side?

GALVIN

I can subpoena you, you know. I can

get you up there on the stand.

MARY ROONEY

And ask me what?

GALVIN

Who put my client in the hospital

for life.

MARY ROONEY

I didn't do it, Mister.

GALVIN

Who are you protecting, then?

MARY ROONEY

Who says that I'm protecting anyone?

GALVIN

I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What

do you owe them?

MARY ROONEY

I don't owe them a goddamn thing.

GALVIN

Then why don't you testify?

MARY ROONEY

(beat)

You know, you're pushy, fella...

GALVIN

You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I

get you on the stand...

MARY ROONEY

Well, maybe you better do that, then.

(starts to close door;

stops)

You know you guys are all the same.

You don't care who gets hurt. You're

a bunch of whores. You'd do anything

for a dollar. You got no loyalty...

no nothing... you're a bunch of

whores.

YOUNG ATTORNEY

His name is Dr. Lionel Thompson.

City College of New York, Class of

twenty-six. Bachelor of Science; New

York College of Medicine; sixteenth

in a class of twenty-two. Nineteen

seventy-six got a courtesy

appointment, staff of anesthesiology,

Easthampton Hospital for Women. Never

married. Has no honors or degrees of

any weight. Since nineteen seventy-

five he's testified in twenty-eight

court cases, twelve malpractice.

(smiles, saving his

best 'til last)

And he's black.

CONCANNON

(beat; stern)

I'm going to tell you how you handle

the fact that he's black. You don't

touch it. You don't mention it. You

treat him like anybody else. Neither

better or worse.

(smiles)

And you get a black lawyer to sit at

our table. Okay...?

YOUNG ATTORNEY

Yessir.

CONCANNON

Good. What else do you do?

YOUNG ATTORNEY

...get the records of his testimony

in the twelve malpractice cases.

CONCANNON

Do it. We'll be at Locke-Obers.

DR. THOMPSON

They gave her the wrong anesthetic.

MICKEY

Why is that?

DR. THOMPSON

(starting on reciting

a list)

Her sister said she ate one hour

prior to admittance... she...

MICKEY

...that's what the sister said. The

chart said she ate nine hours prior

to...

DR. THOMPSON

...she went in complaining of stomach

cramps. Good doctor would have doubted

the information on the chart.

MICKEY

Is that what a good doctor would do?

How old are you, please?

DR. THOMPSON

I am seventy-four years old.

MICKEY

What qualifies you as an expert in

anesthetics?

DR. THOMPSON

I am on the staff of...

MICKEY

Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse

me, what is that, a joke? Let me

tell you something, Doctor, those

men at Catherine Laboure. Men who

are known not only in this city, but

the world, were trying to save a

woman's life. They were there, and

here you are, four years later, read

some hospital report, and say...

DR. THOMPSON

...I made a detailed physical

examination of the patient, Sir,

yesterday evening, I...

MICKEY

(to Dr. Thompson,

casually)

She getting good care over there?

DR. THOMPSON

Actually, yes. It's by no means bad,

I...

MICKEY

(grilling him again)

Then what good would it do to ruin

the reputation of two men, to help a

girl whose life's not going to be

changed in the least? You know what

CODE BLUE means?

DR. THOMPSON

'Code Blue'...

MICKEY

It's a common medical term.

GALVIN

We're going to lose.

GALVIN

Do you think it's my fault?

LAURA

Isn't there something you...

GALVIN

That's not the question. It's over.

(beat)

Do you think that it's my fault? If

I'd... if I'd... I never should have

taken it. There was no way that I

was going to win.

LAURA

You're talking like a drunk.

GALVIN

That's what I am.

LAURA

And it's over...?

GALVIN

Yes.

LAURA

Well, then what are you doing here?

GALVIN

I... do you want me to leave?

LAURA

You do what you want. You want to

leave... You want to go kill yourself?

GALVIN

I...

LAURA

You want me to tell you it's your

fault? It probably is. What are you

going to do about it?

(beat)

I thought it's not over till the

jury comes in.

GALVIN

Who told you that?

LAURA

You told me so. Maybe you'd get some

sympathy. You came to the wrong place.

GALVIN

And what makes you so tough?

LAURA

Maybe I'll tell you later.

GALVIN

Is there going to be a later...?

LAURA

Not if you don't grow up...

GALVIN

If I don't 'grow up...'

LAURA

You're like a kid, you're coming in

here like it's Saturday night, you

want me to say that you've got a

fever -- you don't have to go to

school...

GALVIN

(shakes head sadly)

You, you don't under...

LAURA

Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You

say you're going to lose. Is it my

fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't

start until tomorrow and already

it's over for you!

GALVIN

It's over!

LAURA

What is your wife's picture doing by

the side of your...

GALVIN

What is that to you...?

LAURA

What would you like it to be to me...?

I, I, I can't invest in failure.

GALVIN

Excuse me, I've...

LAURA (V.O.)

Joe...

(beat)

Joe...

GALVIN

(screaming)

Stop pressuring me...

LAURA

You're pressuring yourself...

GALVIN

(shaking head, utterly

denying her)

No... no...

LAURA

Yes.

(beat)

We've all got to let go.

GALVIN

(to Sally)

I'm going to do the best I can for

you and your sister. I know what it

means to you. Believe me...

(beat)

It means that much to me.

MICKEY

How are you holding up?

GALVIN

I'm swell.

MICKEY

And all we've got is a witch doctor!

GALVIN

Yeah.

MICKEY

Look at it this way: it's refreshing

every time a Doctor takes the stand

he's not a Jew.

BAILIFF

Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all persons

having anything to do before the

Honorable, the Justices of the

Superior Court now sitting at Boston

CLERK

Deborah Ann Kaye versus St. Catherine

Laboure, Robert S. Towler, M.D. and

Sheldon F. Marx, M.D.

JUDGE

Is the Plaintiff ready?

GALVIN

(looking up)

Ready, your Honor.

JUDGE

Defense...?

CONCANNON

Ready for the Defense, your Honor.

JUDGE

Let's begin.

GALVIN

It's a terrible thing to sit in

judgment. So much rides on it. I

know that you've thought, 'How can I

be pure. How can I be impartial

without being cold. How can I be

merciful and still be just?' And I

know that most of you have said some

sort of prayer this morning to be

helped. To judge correctly. We have

the reputation of two men. Two well

respected doctors and a renowned

hospital before us. And with those

two respected men we have my client,

Deborah Ann Kaye...

(beat)

...who was deprived of sight, of

locomotion, hearing, speech, of

everything, in short, which

constitutes her life.

(beat)

We are going to prove she was deprived

through negligence.

(beat)

Through the negligence of those

respected men. We will show: One...

ALITO

Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?

YOUNG LAWYER

She's the only nurse who isn't

testifying for the Doctors.

ALITO

What did he find?

YOUNG LAWYER

Nothing.

ALITO

How good's your intelligence?

YOUNG LAWYER

Very good.

ALITO

And so what is the rest of his case

aside from Dr. Thompson?

YOUNG LAWYER

As far as we know, nothing.

ALITO

Thank Mr. Concannon for me. Please

tell him I'll see him at his office.

CONCANNON

Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows,

you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.

Is that correct?

DR. THOMPSON

That is correct. I was engaged to

render an opinion.

CONCANNON

Engaged to render an opinion. For a

price. Is that correct? You're being

paid to be here today?

DR. THOMPSON

Just as you are, Sir...

CONCANNON

Are you board-certified in

anesthesiology, Doctor?

DR. THOMPSON

No, I am not. It's quite common in

New York State...

CONCANNON

...I'm sure it is, but this is

Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in

Internal Medicine?

DR. THOMPSON

No.

CONCANNON

Neurology?

DR. THOMPSON

No.

CONCANNON

Orthopedics?

DR. THOMPSON

I'm just an M.D.

CONCANNON

Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?

DR. THOMPSON

I know of him.

CONCANNON

How is that?

DR. THOMPSON

Through, through his book.

CONCANNON

What book is that?

DR. THOMPSON

Meth... Methodology and Technique...

CONCANNON

...of Anesthesiology?

DR. THOMPSON

'Methodology and Techniques of

Anesthesiology.' Yes.

CONCANNON

How old are you?

DR. THOMPSON

I am seventy-four years old.

CONCANNON

Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of

medicine?

DR. THOMPSON

I'm on the staff of...

CONCANNON

Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you

testify quite a bit against other

physicians? Isn't that right? You,

you're available for that? When you're

paid to be there?

DR. THOMPSON

Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong...

as in this case, I am available. I

am seventy-four years old, I am not

board-certified.

DR. THOMPSON

I have been practicing medicine for

forty-six years and I know when an

injustice has been done.

CONCANNON

Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do.

Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the

time. We will admit the Doctor as an

'expert witness,' fine.

JUDGE

(in undertone, to

Bailiff)

Do we have time this morning to...

(glances at watch,

Bailiff nods to him)

All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to

continue now, or we can resume with

Dr. Thompson this afternoon.

GALVIN

(rising)

Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.

Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah

Ann Kaye last night at The Northern

Chronic Care Facility?

DR. THOMPSON

I did.

CONCANNON

Objection.

JUDGE

Sustained. Yes. The witness will

confine his testimony to review of

the hospital records.

GALVIN

What?

JUDGE

(patronizing)

I believe that's the law... is it

not, Mr. Galvin...?

GALVIN

Dr. Thompson. From your review of

the hospital records of May twelfth

nineteen seventy-six.

GALVIN

In your opinion, what happened to

Deborah Ann Kaye?

DR. THOMPSON

Cardiac arrest. During delivery her

heart stopped. When the heart stops

the brain's deprived of oxygen. You

get brain damage. That is why she's

in the state she's in today.

GALVIN

Now, Dr. Towler's testified that

they restored the heartbeat within

three or four minutes. In your opinion

is his estimate correct?

DR. THOMPSON

It's my opinion it took him much

longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's

too much brain damage.

JUDGE

(to Dr. Thompson)

Are you saying that a failure to

restore the heartbeat within nine

minutes in itself constitutes bad

medical practice?

DR. THOMPSON

Well...

GALVIN

Your Honor!

JUDGE

Yes, Mr. Galvin?

GALVIN

If I may be permitted to question my

own witness in my own way...

JUDGE

I'd just like to get to the point,

Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these

people's time. Answer the question,

Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine

minute lapse in restoring the

heartbeat in and of itself be

negligence?

DR. THOMPSON

I... in that small context I would

have... I would have to say 'no.'

JUDGE

Then you're saying there's no

negligence, based on my question?

DR. THOMPSON

I... given the limits of your

question, that's correct.

JUDGE

The Doctors were not negligent.

DR. THOMPSON

(beat)

I... um...

JUDGE

Thank you.

GALVIN

I'm not through with the witness,

your Honor. With all due respect if

you are going to try my case for me

I would appreciate it if you wouldn't

lose it.

JUDGE

Thank you. I think that's enough for

this morning. I'll see the Plaintiff's

Counsel in my chambers. Now, please.

JUDGE

I got a letter from the Judge

Advocate's office on you today, fella,

you're on your way out... They should

have kicked you out on that

Lillibridge case. Now this is it

today.

GALVIN

I'm an attorney on trial before the

bar. Representing my client. My

client, do you understand? You open

your mouth and you're losing my case

for me.

JUDGE

Listen to me, fella...

GALVIN

No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted

in this case is an even shake. You

rushed me into court in five days...

my star witness disappears, I can't

get a continuance, and I don't give

a damn. I'm going up there and I'm

going to try it. Let the Jury decide.

They told me Sweeney he's a hard-

ass, he's a defendant's judge. I

don't care. I said, the hell with

it. The hell with it. I'll take my

chances he'll be fair.

JUDGE

(conciliatory)

Galvin, look, many years ago...

GALVIN

And don't give me this shit, 'I was

a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who

you were. You couldn't hack it as a

lawyer. You were Bag Man for the

Boys and you still are. I know who

you are.

JUDGE

(beat; barely

controlling anger)

Are you done?

GALVIN

Damn right I'm done. I'm going to

ask for a mistrial and I'm going to

request that you disqualify yourself

from sitting on this case. I'm going

to take a transcript to the State

and ask that they impeach your ass.

JUDGE

You aren't going to get a mistrial,

boy. We're going back this afternoon,

we're going to try this case to an

end. Now you get out of here before

I call the Bailiff and have you thrown

in jail.

SALLY

What does it mean?

(beat)

I... I mean we, you have other

tactics...

GALVIN

We, yes. Yes. They, they present

their side, and I get the same chance.

To cross-examine... to... to...

SALLY

Are we going to win?

(beat, desperately

needing to trust)

We have, you know, other tactics,

though...

GALVIN

Yes.

CONCANNON

No further questions.

GALVIN

Dr. Towler...

TOWLER

Yes.

GALVIN

You have a record of what happened

in the operating room...

TOWLER

Yes, that's correct.

GALVIN

...there are notations every thirty

seconds...

TOWLER

Yes.

GALVIN

...of the procedures...

TOWLER

Yes, the roving nurse...

GALVIN

But those notations stop...

(consults notes)

...Four-and-one-half minutes after

Deborah Ann Kaye's...

TOWLER

We, we were rather busy...

GALVIN

Four-and-one-half minutes after her

heart stopped.

(beat)

And they resume seven minutes...

TOWLER

As I've said we had some more...

GALVIN

...they start again three minutes

earlier...

TOWLER

We had rather more important things

on our mind than taking notes.

(beat)

We were trying to restore her...

GALVIN

What happened in those three...

TOWLER

...we were trying to restore her

heartbeat.

GALVIN

What happened in those three

minutes...?

TOWLER

(beat; controls himself)

We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were

administering electro...

GALVIN

Why did it take that long to get her

heartbeat...

CONCANNON (V.O.)

Objection, we've...

GALVIN

...to get her heartbeat back...?

CONCANNON (V.O.)

We've touched on this, his own witness

has said...

GALVIN

(overriding him)

...almost nine minutes... causing

brain damage.

CONCANNON

Your Honor...! Your Honor...

TOWLER

Brain damage could have been... it

didn't necessarily take nine minutes,

it could have been caused in two...

GALVIN

Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that

her brain damage could have been

caused by her being deprived of oxygen

for two minutes...?

TOWLER

Yes.

GALVIN

(contemptuous)

Huh. And why is that?

TOWLER

Because she was anemic.

(beat)

It's right there on her chart. Her

brain was getting less oxygen

anyway...

DR. THOMPSON

I didn't do too well for you.

GALVIN

No, you did fine.

DR. THOMPSON

I'm afraid that's not true.

(beat)

Will you want me to stay on till

Monday?

GALVIN

No. No thank you, Doctor. You go

home.

DR. THOMPSON

You know... sometimes people can

surprise you. Sometimes they have a

great capacity to hear the truth.

GALVIN

Yes... I... yes.

DR. THOMPSON

You sure you don't want me to stay

on.

GALVIN

No. No. Thank you. You go home.

MICKEY

I'm going back to the office.

LAURA

Is it over?

GALVIN

No.

LAURA

What are you going to do?

GALVIN

I don't have a goddamned idea.

GALVIN

Okay. What do you do when you don't

have a witness?

MICKEY

(reciting a catechism;

dispiritedly)

You use their witness.

GALVIN

That's right.

MICKEY

I think we tried that. The case is

over.

MICKEY

And how the fuck... You broke the

first law that they taught you in

law school. You never ask a question

you don't know the answer to.

(beat)

Frankie, wake up. You got your own

expert witness says there was no

negligence. It's over. Period.

There'll be no other cases...

GALVIN

There are no other cases. This is

the case.

(beat)

Now you decide...

(beat)

Are you in or out...?

CONCANNON

I know how you feel. I know you don't

believe me, but I do. I'm going to

tell you something I learned when I

was your age. I had prepared a case.

Mr. White asked me, 'How did you

do.'

(beat)

I said, 'I've done my best.' He said,

'They don't pay you to do your best.

They pay you to win.'

(beat)

That's what pays for this office.

(beat)

And that's what pays for the pro

bono work that we do for the poor.

And for the kind of law that you

want to practice. And that's what

pays for your clothes and my whiskey,

and the leisure that we have to sit

back and discuss philosophy.

(beat)

As we're doing tonight.

(beat)

We're paid to win the case.

CONCANNON

You finished your marriage. You wanted

to come back and practice law. You

wanted to come back to the world.

CONCANNON (V.O.)

Welcome back.

GALVIN

Why doesn't Mary Rooney testify?

GALVIN

Are you with me... are you awake...?

MICKEY

Yeah. I'm awake.

GALVIN

Rooney's protecting someone. Who is

she protecting?

MICKEY

The Doctors.

GALVIN

She's protecting the Doctors she'd

be up there on the stand...

MICKEY

(listlessly)

Read me what she said.

GALVIN

'You guys are a bunch of whores...

uh... loyalty... you don't care who

gets hurt... you don't have any

loyalty...'

MICKEY

...one of the other nurses?

GALVIN

Who? They're all testifying. Everybody

who was in the O.R.'s going to take

the stand.

MICKEY

All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?

GALVIN

What difference can that make...?

All right...

GALVIN

Uh... the admitting nurse...

MICKEY

What did she do?

GALVIN

She didn't do anything. She took the

patient's history and signed the

charts. 'K.C.'

(looks in the notes

for what the initials

signify)

'Kathy Costello...'

MICKEY

The 'History'...?

GALVIN

(explaining)

How old are you, how many children...

when did you last eat...

GALVIN

Miss Rooney. Oh. Listen.

(beat)

I understand what you are doing. And

I want you to know it's all right.

ROONEY

What are you talking about?

GALVIN

About Kathy Costello.

(beat)

I understand, and I don't blame you

for shielding her.

GALVIN

I spoke to her, and everything is

all right.

ROONEY

I, what are you talking about? I

talked to her this morning, and she

said...

GALVIN

(nods)

She told me.

ROONEY

(credulous)

She did?

GALVIN

I just saw her.

ROONEY

In New York?

GALVIN

What?

ROONEY

You saw Kat in New York...

(beat)

...or is she in town? Is she in

town...?

GALVIN

Thank you. I'm sorry.

GALVIN

We don't have anything from the Nurse

Association?

MICKEY

The broad has disappeared...

GALVIN

The Hospital...?

MICKEY

No records since she quit in '76.

She quit two weeks after the incident.

GALVIN

Thank you.

LAURA

I have to talk to you.

GALVIN

(to Mickey)

Call the A.M.A.

(to Laura)

...I can't talk now.

(to Mickey)

...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...

you have to find this nurse...

MICKEY

...yeah... good...

GALVIN

...you need some old forms that she

had... somebody's dying...

GALVIN (V.O.)

Hello, Mrs. Costello...

GALVIN

Sorry to bother you so late.

GALVIN

This is Mr. Goldberg in Accounting.

We have some money here for you...

This is the Mrs. Costello that used

to be a nurse?

(beat)

I'm sorry. I think we have our records

mixed up.

GALVIN

Are you related to Kathy Costello,

the R.N.?... I'm sorry...

MICKEY (V.O.)

Hello, this is Dr. Dorchester in

Boston. This is an emergency. A nurse

left my employ...

MICKEY

...four years ago...

GALVIN

Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in

Records. We're looking for Kathy

Costello...

MICKEY

(voice over; in the

other room, shouting)

I need a cigarette!

(resumes on-the-phone

tone)

She left my office four years ago,

we're looking for a chart...

(covers phone; again

shouts)

I need a cigarette...

GALVIN

Thank you. I'll hold.

GALVIN

Hello. This is Ross Williams. I'm

calling from California. I'm sorry.

I know it's late in the East, but

this is an emergency. May I please

speak to Kathy Costello?

(beat)

I'm sorry. My records must be

confused. This is the family of Kathy

Costello...? Please excuse it.

FEMALE

(voice over; on phone)

Hello.

GALVIN

Hello, I'm calling from...

VOICE

If you're selling something, I'm

late for work...

GALVIN

I'm calling from Professional Nurse

Quarterly...

VOICE

From the magazine?

GALVIN

This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?

VOICE

How come you're calling me from...?

GALVIN

This is Miss Costello...?

VOICE

Yes. Price...

GALVIN

Pardon?

VOICE

Kathy Price.

GALVIN

We find that your subscription

lapsed...

VOICE

(laughs)

My subscription lapsed three years

ago...

GALVIN

That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...

VOICE

Missus...

GALVIN

We have a renew-your-subscription

offer...

VOICE

We get it at work. We get the magazine

at work.

GALVIN

Yes, we know that you do. I have it

in my files. That's at the Manhattan

Health Center...

VOICE

No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look,

call me Monday, hey? I'm late for

work.

LAURA

(on phone)

Hello? Mr. Gal... where are you...?

LAURA

You're going to New York? I... you're

kidding... Because I'm going to New

York.

(beat)

I just got a call. I have to go sign

papers. About my divorce. I... good.

Frank. We'll meet there. All right?

LAURA

Can we meet there, Joe?

MICKEY

(to Laura)

You got a cigarette...?

LAURA

At the Beacon. On Fifty-third

Street... we can spend the night.

LAURA (V.O.)

(on phone)

At around four...?

LAURA

I feel the same way, Joe... I'll see

you this afternoon?

MICKEY

You got any cigarettes?

KATHY

Hi.

GALVIN

Hi. How are you doing?

GALVIN

I've been meaning to come in a long

time.

KATHY

You live in the neighborhood?

GALVIN

Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be

staying with us in a few months, so

I stopped by.

KATHY

How old is he?

GALVIN

Four. You're great with these kids.

KATHY

Thank you.

GALVIN

You're really...

(stops, remembering

something)

You, are you the one they told me

was the nurse?

KATHY

Who told you that?

GALVIN

(gestures back at the

office, vaguely)

Mrs...

KATHY

Mrs. Simmonds.

GALVIN

Yes.

KATHY

(very serious, correct)

I used to be a nurse.

GALVIN

That's a wonderful profession. My

daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did

you do, stop?

KATHY

Yes.

GALVIN

How come you stopped?

GALVIN

(beat; gently dropping

his pretense)

Will you help me?

GALVIN

What the hell are you doing here?

MICKEY

We got to talk.

GALVIN

What are you doing in New York...?

MICKEY

Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...

LAURA

(as if in shock)

It's all right... it's all right...

it's all right... it's all right...

MICKEY

I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar

Association.

(beat)

The broad used to work for one of

Concannon's partners in New York

awhile ago.

(beat; lamely)

She wanted to move to Boston.

(beat)

How badly did she hurt us, Joe?

GALVIN

I don't know.

MICKEY

We got a mistrial, you know. Joe --

did you hear what I said...?

GALVIN

I don't want a mistrial.

MICKEY

He's not here.

(pause)

Yeah. I don't know when.

(pause)

All right.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

The Knicks are pressing hard...

(etc.)

GALVIN

Dr. Towler; page 406,

'Contraindications to general

anesthetic. Ideally a patient should

refrain from taking nourishment up

to nine hours prior to induction of

general anesthetic.' Does that sound

familiar?

DR. TOWLER

Yes. I wrote it.

GALVIN

'Practice and Methodology in

Anaesthesia.' General textbook on

the subject. Is that correct?

DR. TOWLER

I. Yes. It is.

GALVIN

And you wrote that...

DR. TOWLER

Yes.

GALVIN

(reading)

...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken

nourishment within one hour prior to

inducement, general anesthetic should

be avoided at all costs because of

the grave risk the patient will

aspirate food particles into his

mask.' Is that what happened to

Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into

her mask?

DR. TOWLER

She threw up in her mask, yes. But

she hadn't eaten one hour prior to

admission.

GALVIN

If she had eaten, say one hour prior

to admission, the inducement of a

general anesthetic... the type you

gave her... would have been

negligent...?

DR. TOWLER

Negligent. Yes... it would have been

criminal. But that was not the case.

GALVIN

Thank you.

JUDGE

Mr. Concannon...?

CONCANNON

Nothing further, your Honor.

JUDGE

Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?

GALVIN

(to Bailiff)

Katherine Price.

BAILIFF

Katherine Price...

BAILIFF (V.O.)

State your name please.

KATHY (V.O.)

Katherine Lynn Price.

BAILIFF

D'you swear that the evidence you

are about to give will be the truth,

the...

BAILIFF

...whole truth and nothing but the

truth, so help you God?

KATHY

I do.

BAILIFF

Be seated.

GALVIN

Kathy Price...

KATHY

Yes...

GALVIN

You were the Admitting Nurse at St.

Catherine Laboure Hospital on May

twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the

night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...

KATHY

Yes.

GALVIN

You signed this form?

KATHY

Yes.

GALVIN

These are your initials, 'K.C.'?

KATHY

Kathy Costello. That's my maiden

name.

GALVIN

D'you ask the patient when did she

last eat?

KATHY

Yes.

GALVIN

What did she say?

KATHY

She said she had a full meal one

hour before coming to the hospital.

GALVIN

One hour.

KATHY

Yes.

GALVIN

And did you write the numeral 'one'

down on the record, standing for one

hour?

KATHY

I did.

GALVIN

A single hour.

KATHY

Yes.

GALVIN

(to Concannon)

Your witness.

CONCANNON

You are aware of the penalties for

perjury...?

KATHY

It's a crime.

CONCANNON

Yes.

(beat)

It is a crime. A serious crime.

KATHY

I wouldn't do it.

CONCANNON

You would not...?

KATHY

No.

CONCANNON

In fact, you've just taken an oath

that you would not commit perjury.

You've just sworn to that. Isn't

that right?

KATHY

Yes.

CONCANNON

Just now...

KATHY

Yes.

CONCANNON

...sworn before God you would tell

the truth?

KATHY

(beat)

Yes.

CONCANNON

Now. I'd like to ask you something:

four years ago, when you were working

as a nurse, are you aware that Drs.

Towler and Marx based their treatment

of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart

that you signed...?

KATHY

I...

CONCANNON

And wasn't that an oath...? These

are your initials here: K.C. When

you signed this chart you took an

oath. No less important than that

which you took today.

(beat)

Isn't that right?

(beat)

Isn't that right...?

KATHY

I... yes.

CONCANNON

Then, please, which is correct? You've

sworn today the patient ate one hour

ago. Four years ago you swore she

ate nine hours ago? Which is the

lie. When were you lying?

KATHY

I...

CONCANNON

You know these doctors could have

settled out of court. They wanted a

trial. They wanted to clear their

names.

GALVIN

Objection!

CONCANNON

And you would come here, and on a

slip of memory four years ago, you'd

ruin their lives.

KATHY

They lied.

CONCANNON

'They lied.' Indeed! When did they

lie? And do you know what a lie is?

KATHY

I do. Yes.

CONCANNON

(holding chart)

You swore on this form that the

patient ate nine hours ago.

KATHY

That's not my handwriting.

CONCANNON

You've just said you signed it.

KATHY

Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But

I, I didn't write that figure.

CONCANNON

You didn't write that figure. And

how is it that you remember that so

clearly after four years?

KATHY

(taking a paper out

of her purse)

Because I kept a copy. I have it

right here.

CONCANNON

Objection! This is ri... expect us

to accept a photocopy, we have the

original right...

JUDGE

I'll rule on that presently.

(beat)

Proceed.

JUDGE

Please proceed.

CONCANNON

...what in the world would induce

you to make a photocopy of some

obscure record and hold it four years?

This is a... why? Why would you do

that?

KATHY

I thought I would need it.

CONCANNON

And why, please tell us, would you

think that?

KATHY

After, after the operation, when

that poor girl, she went in a coma.

Dr. Towler called me in. He told me

he had five difficult deliveries in

a row and he was tired, and he never

looked at the admittance form.

(beat)

And he told me to change the form.

He told me to change the one to a

nine.

(beat)

Or else, or else, he said...

(beat; starts to cry)

He said he'd fire me. He said I'd

never work again... Who were these

men...? Who were these men...? I

wanted to be a nurse...

CONCANNON

No further questions.

JUDGE

You may step down.

JUDGE

Mr. Galvin...?

GALVIN

Nothing further, your Honor...

JUDGE

Mr. Concannon...?

JUDGE

Mr. Concannon.

CONCANNON

Thank you, your Honor. We object to

the copy of the admissions form as

incompetent and essentially hearsay

evidence and cite McGee versus State

of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216

through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The

admission of a duplicate document in

preference to an existing original

must presuppose the possibility of

alteration and so must be disallowed.'

And, your Honor, having given the

Plaintiff the leeway we would like

your ruling on this issue now: we

object to the admission of the Xerox

form.

JUDGE

...one moment, Mr. Concannon...

JUDGE

The document is disallowed, the jury

will be advised not to consider the

testimony of Kathy Costello regarding

the Xerox form.

(explains to them)

It's unsubstantiated and we can't

accept a copy in preference to the

original...

CONCANNON

Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms.

Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a

'Surprise Witness' she may only serve

to rebut direct testimony. As her

only evidentiary rebuttal was the

admitting form, which has been

disallowed I request that her entire

testimony be disallowed and the jury

advised that they must totally

disregard her appearance here.

JUDGE

I'm going to uphold that.

GALVIN

I object, your Honor...

JUDGE

Overruled...

GALVIN

Exception!

JUDGE

Noted. Thank you.

(to Jury)

Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.

Her sole rebuttal was the document,

which has been disallowed...

JUDGE (V.O.)

Her entire testimony must be stricken

from the record. You shouldn't have

heard it, but you did. Now, that was

my mistake... and you must strike it

from your minds, give it no weight.

ALITO

Legally it's over. Concannon was

brilliant.

BROPHY

Tell me about Kaitlin Costello.

ALITO

There's nothing to tell. It's been

stricken from the record.

BROPHY

I know. Did you believe her?

JUDGE SWEENEY

Mr. Galvin...?

GALVIN

You know, so much of the time we're

lost. We say, 'Please, God, tell us

what is right. Tell us what's true.

There is no justice. The rich win,

the poor are powerless...' We become

tired of hearing people lie. After a

time we become dead. A little dead.

We start thinking of ourselves as

victims.

(pause)

And we become victims.

(pause)

And we become weak... and doubt

ourselves, and doubt our

institutions... and doubt our

beliefs... we say for example, 'The

law is a sham... there is no law...

I was a fool for having believed

there was.'

(beat)

But today you are the law. You are

the law... And not some book and not

the lawyers, or the marble statues

and the trappings of the court...

all that they are is symbols.

(beat)

Of our desire to be just...

(beat)

All that they are, in effect, is a

prayer...

(beat)

...a fervent, and a frightened prayer.

GALVIN

In my religion we say, 'Act as if

you had faith, and faith will be

given to you.'

(beat)

If... If we would have faith in

justice, we must only believe in

ourselves.

(beat)

And act with justice.

(beat)

And I believe that there is justice

in our hearts.

(beat)

Thank you.

JUDGE

Have you reached a verdict?

FOREMAN (V.O.)

We have, your Honor.

FOREMAN

Your Honor, we have agreed to hold

for the Plaintiff... but on the size

of the award, are we bound...

JUDGE

You are not bound by anything, other

than your good judgment, based on

the evidence.

FOREMAN (V.O.)

Are we permitted to award an amount

greater than the amount the Plaintiff

asked for?

JUDGE

Yes. You are.

JUDGE

Please retire and...

MICKEY

(to Galvin)

The jury might be out for awhile.

(beat; tentatively)

You want to run across the street

and get a drink?

FADE OUT:

THE END
