Five Easy Pieces - by Carole Eastman

WYNETTE (V.O.)

"And if you love him/Oh be proud of

him/For after all, he's just a

man..."

WYNETTE (V.O.)

"Stand by your man/And show the

world you love him/Keep giving all

the love you can/Stand by your

man."

RAYETTE

(Arky accent)

I'm gonna play it again...

BOBBY

You're not going to play it again.

RAYETTE

Well, lemme play the other side

then.

BOBBY

No.

RAYETTE

Now quit, Bobby. You said you're

goin' a help me pick a song.

BOBBY

You said.

RAYETTE

Well, lemme sing the one I picked

an' see what you think...

(she sings)

"When there's a fire in your

heart/Break the glass/Sound the

alarm..."

RAYETTE

Oh, you prick...

RAYETTE

How 'bout if I just cut off your

damn water?

BOBBY

I'm too moved by your gentility to

speak.

RAYETTE

Sugar, you know how I feel about

you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to

get you to take an interest in my

kind a things, an' what I'm tryin'

to do with myself...

(bringing her face close

to his)

You know, there id'n anything in

the world I wouldn't do for you,

baby. I started livin' the day I

found you, you know that?

BOBBY

You're playing the other side.

BOBBY

Cerveza.

RAYETTE

(grabbing it from him)

Serveza yourself!

BOBBY

Now, now.

RAYETTE

(she stands up)

No, dammit, I would easy.

BOBBY

But you heal fast.

RAYETTE

(over the above)

You can play the piano, an' your

whole damn family can play on some

type a musical instrument. An' all

I'm askin' is for you to listen to

my singing for one single little

second...

RAYETTE

But you think you would? No, you're

too damn selfish...

BOBBY

Why'nt you take 'at sign off your

tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.

RAYETTE

Out where?

BOBBY

I don't know, I'll holler up Elton

an' Stoney...

RAYETTE

I'll go out with you, or I'll stay

here, and do anything you'd like

for me to do... if you'll just do

one thing. If you'll tell me that

you love me.

BOBBY

You can sing the song.

RAYETTE

(annoyed)

You know what, you are never

satisfied.

BOBBY

That's right, hand.

RAYETTE

Oh, now, baby...

ELTON

(Okie accent)

Your ball, Ray.

RAYETTE

(reluctant)

Is this suppose to be fun?

BOBBY

Go on, get up there...

BOBBY (CONT'D)

... and stay relaxed this time.

BOBBY

Now don't loft it, just release it

like I told you.

RAYETTE

The ball's too heavy for me,

honey...

BOBBY

It's not the damn ball.

RAYETTE

I'm tryin', baby, so don't start

gettin' mad now.

BOBBY

No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll

be all right. Just spot and follow

through...

BOBBY (CONT'D)

(mumbling)

Shit.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Nice ball, El.

RAYETTE

Id'n he somethin' to see?

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

Is it my turn again?

BOBBY

Right. Now show me a little

somethin' this time, okay? Give me

some form...

RAYETTE

I can't help it, honey, the ball

just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on

me...

BOBBY

Will you just do what the hell I

tell you...

RAYETTE

I did, didn' I, El?

BOBBY

You got another ball comin'.

ELTON

Atta boy, Ray!

RAYETTE

That was damn good, wad'n it? I

finally did it...

BOBBY

Yeah, great.

(begins removing his

bowling shoes)

Why don't you throw Z's for 19

frames, and then roll a strike on

the last ball in the last frame of

a losing game? Just wonderful.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Wasn't it, ladies?

TWINKY

(pointing at herself)

Are you talking to us?

RAYETTE

I'm gonna go wait in the car.

BOBBY

Yeah, why don't you do that.

STONEY

Wait an I'll I go with you,

honey...

ELTON

(changing his shoes)

We gotta get on home an' relieve

the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come

on over.

BOBBY

Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for

the beers...

(hands him the bowling

shoes)

An' walk Rayette over with you,

will you.

WAITRESS

Can I get you anything else?

BOBBY

No. How much do I owe you?

WAITRESS

Five'll do it.

TWINKY

We been wantin' to ask you

something. Are you the guy on YV?

BOBBY

Am I on TV?

TWINKY

(pointing lo Betty)

She says you're the one that sells

all the cars on TV.

BOBBY

Well, I don't claim to have sold

'em all. They still have some left,

I believe.

BETTY

See, I told you it was him...

(then to Bobby)

Your name's Donnie something,

right?

BOBBY

I leave it to you.

BETTY

My name is Shirley, but they call

me Betty, and her name's Twinky.

BOBBY

(looking to Twinky)

Twinky?

BETTY

(explaining)

Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...

BOBBY

(looking from one to the

other)

Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is

nice talking to you girls. I just

wish I had more time...

BETTY

That's a wig you wear, isn't it?

BOBBY

(touching his hair)

A wig?

BETTY

Yeah, I told her it was you, but

that you're wearing a wig, 'cause

on TV you're mostly bald in the

front.

BOBBY

(to Twinky)

Your little friend's real sharp

there...

(to Betty)

Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig

on TV, because with two and a half

million people watching you, you've

gotta be sincere. I just like to

wear it when I'm out slippin'

around bowling alleys an' things

like that. I think it gives me a

little more class, don't you?

TWINKY

Oh, definitely...

BETTY

(looking at his hairline)

Yeah, but I can see a little bitty

of the net up there, that's what

give it away.

TWINKY

It's so weird to see you in person,

but that's who she says you are.

BETTY

(to her)

It is him, he said it's him.

(to Bobby)

Aren't you.

BOBBY

Yeah, you could say it's me.

TWINKY

I'm gonna give you our number,

Donnie, just in case...

(as she writes)

We're both professionals, if you

didn't guess.

BOBBY

Well, you seem very professional...

TWINKY

(handing the score sheet

to him)

I always tell everyone the same

thing. I got rolled and beat up

real bad recently, and since then

it's two for one, an' I work

strictly in tandem with Betty...

BOBBY

Yeah, I can see how she'd come in

handy.

BOBBY

Come on. We're goin' over to

Elton's.

RAYETTE

I'm not.

BOBBY

You just going to sit there?

RAYETTE

Yes.

BOBBY

Okay. Hope no one hits on you.

RAYETTE

I hope they do.

BOBBY

See you later, then...

BOBBY

No one would want to hit on you,

you look too pathetic.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Come on, DiPesto. We can still have

a good time.

RAYETTE

You're the pathetic one, not me.

BOBBY

I'm going on over there...

RAYETTE

I'm not some piece a crap.

BOBBY

I know you're not.

RAYETTE

You treat me like I was.

BOBBY

I'm sorry.

RAYETTE

(close to tears)

You go slippin' around in front a

my face, an' in front a Elton an'

Stoney. What do you imagine they

think a someone you treat that

way...

BOBBY

Now, hand...

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Elton and Stoney know how I feel

about you. An' they're just goin'

to think I'm not too nice a guy,

which I'm not, an' that you're a

hell of a person puttin' up with

me, that's all.

RAYETTE

You're goin' a find me dead one

time.

BOBBY

Sssh, come on now...

(he kisses her)

Be a good girl.

RAYETTE

If you really want a get up an'

leave me, you can read about it in

the newsprint.

BOBBY

I'm not going to get up an' leave

you.

(kisses her again, then:)

Now let's go over to El's an' have

a good time.

RAYETTE

Do you love me, Bobby?

BOBBY

Well now, what do you think?

ELTON

God, id'n she the cutest damn thing

in your life!

BOBBY

Can you believe this shit?

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Goddamned freeway... Jesus

Christ...

ELTON

Give 'em the horn, Bob.

BOBBY

Look at these assholes! What the

hell are they doing?!

BOBBY

I can't take this shit anymore.

DRIVER

Hey, get off my car!

ELTON

Where the hell's he goin'?

ELTON

Hey, Bob! Come on! Quit foolin'

around!

ELTON

Shit, what's he doin'?

ELTON

You better get your butt off there,

Bob! Come on, now!!

BOBBY

I was with Elton last night, Ray.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

It's the truth.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Rayette...

RAYETTE

You son of a bitch.

ELTON

I swore to God I'd never hire on to

this type a work again. Christ, I

don't know how the hell I let you

talk me into it...

RAYETTE

Give me a swig, hon'.

ELTON

You didn' know I was a derrickman

once, did you?

ELTON (CONT'D)

Down in the southern fields, an'

man, did I hate it. An' Stoney's

brother was a well-puller, wad'n

he, honey? The one with three

fingers?

STONEY

(her eyes on the TV)

My brother Cruser, yeah...

ELTON

I once hung suspendered 90 feet up

on a tour, like a damn circus

artist...

RAYETTE

Honey, took at this little bugger.

ELTON

Near broke my damn neck...

RAYETTE

Id'n he the cutest little guy?

BOBBY

Very cute... Put it down, an' let's

go.

ELTON

You know, you oughta get you one

them things, Bob.

BOBBY

(standing up)

Yeah...

(stretching his arms)

An' I oughta live in a trailer park

with my front teeth poked out...

ELTON

Well, what if she was, Bob? I can't

see nothin' so bad in it...

ELTON (CONT'D)

What if I was to let you in on the

little fact that she is.

ELTON (CONT'D)

That's right. She told me. An'

she's all tore up about it, which I

hate a see.

ELTON

Hell, id'n it just somethin' to

face up to? I'll tell you,

somewhere along the line, you even

get to likin' the whole idea...

ELTON

I recall when Stoney first give me

the news, I could a shit...

ELTON

Well, id'n that nice.

BOBBY

(attacking the messenger)

It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here,

listening to some asshole cracker

compare his life to mine!

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Just keep telling me about the good

life, Elton, if you want a see me

puke my lunch!

ELTON

If you're sayin' you're somethin'

better'n what I am, that's one

thing. But I can't say much a

someone who'd run off an' leave a

woman in a situation like this an'

feel easy about it. An' that's all

I gotta say.

BOBBY

I hope that's all you gotta say,

El, 'cause I'm about as tired of

your mouth as I am workin' this

stinkin' hole!

ELTON

Shit ass!!

BOBBY

Hey, Longcipher! I'm quitting!

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Longcipher! I'm talking to you!

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Did you hear me?! I said I'm

quitting!

DRILLER

I don't give a shit what you do.

You ben more trouble than you're

worth, an' I'm damn glad to be rid

of both a you assholes.

BOBBY

Hey! What's goin' on?!

ELTON

Don't do that, Bob!! It's the Law!

ELTON (CONT'D)

It's the Law, Bob, don't mix in!

ELTON (CONT'D)

Look out behind!

ELTON (CONT'D)

Hey, don't do that. Don't you think

you could just leave him...

ELTON

Sure as hell he wouldn' a done that

if he'd known who you was... Would

you, Bob?

BOBBY

Christ Almighty, what's happening

here?

SECOND MAN

Okay, let him go.

BOBBY

Tell me what in the hell's going

on, Elton!

ELTON

I got accused a robbin' a

fillin'station down in the Indian

Nation, didn' I tell you...

SECOND MAN

Come on.

ELTON

I got wild an' jumped my bail...

SECOND MAN

Move it!

ELTON

(over his shoulder, to

Bobby)

An' here they come runnin' after me

a year later... Ain't that

somethin'?

ELTON

Tell Stoney for me, will you?! Tell

her to come get me...

TWINKY

Donnie, oh Donnie...

FIRST ENGINEER

There she goes again.

SECOND ENGINEER

My 1-year-old can carry a tune

better than that.

SECOND ENGINEER (CONT'D)

Miss Dupea.

SECOND ENGINEER (CONT'D)

(more emphatic)

Miss Dupea.

TITA

(annoyed)

Yes.

SECOND ENGINEER

I'd like to remind you again, this

isn't an opera or a musical comedy.

TITA

Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing

again?

SECOND ENGINEER

If you want to call it that.

TITA

Well, you have to simply tell me,

that's all.

SECOND ENGINEER

That's exactly what I am doing,

again.

TITA

Do you have to let me get halfway

through the movement first? This is

tiring me.

SECOND ENGINEER

I have a suggestion. Why don't we

take a break.

TITA

Oh, for pity's sake...

FIRST ENGINEER

Is she going to cry again?

TITA

I don't want to take a break.

SECOND ENGINEER

What would you like in your coffee?

TITA

Tea.

BOBBY

Would you tell her Bobby's here?

SECOND ENGINEER

(to the mike)

Miss Dupea, Bobby's here.

TITA

(very emotional)

Oh my goodness... Bobby...

BOBBY

Hi, Tita.

TITA

Robert Eroica...

BOBBY

Now don't...

TITA

No, I'm not...

(taking a deep breath,

then:)

I'm not.

BOBBY

That's good.

TITA

I just can't look at you.

BOBBY

Don't, then.

TITA

You always do this to me.

BOBBY

Well, I don't mean to.

(setting the cup down on

the piano)

Here's your tea, Tita.

TITA

Thank you...

(then:)

Oh no, don't put it on there...

BOBBY

Sorry.

TITA

(caressing the piano)

This is a very special, very old CB

275...

BOBBY

Oh.

TITA

You know who it once belonged to?

BOBBY

No.

TITA

Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.

BOBBY

(politely)

No kidding.

TITA

It has absolutely no objectionable

idiosyncrasies...

TITA (CONT'D)

Robert...

BOBBY

(stops playing)

Very nice.

TITA

I have to talk seriously with

you...

BOBBY

Everybody still up on the Island?

TITA

Well, Herbert's mostly on the

mainland because of the orchestra,

so at the moment, there's just

Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van

Oost.

BOBBY

Who's Van Oost?

TITA

(not fond of the subject)

Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's

working with Carl.

BOBBY

Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing

coaching piano?

TITA

Well, 11 months ago he was on his

bicycle, on his way to the post

office in La Roche... and he ran

into a Jeep and sprained his

neck...

BOBBY

Sprained his neck?

TITA

It's not funny. He permanently

sprained his neck, and since then

it's been extremely difficult for

him to tuck the violin.

BOBBY

Crashes into a Jeep and totals his

neck.

(shaking his head)

That's Carl...

TITA

Robert, I have to tell you

something...

BOBBY

What?

TITA

Daddy's very ill.

BOBBY

Oh, well, what, what's he...

TITA

He's had two strokes.

TITA (CONT'D)

He's not... They feel he... maybe

he might not recover, and that

he'll either...

BOBBY

(standing up)

Don't tell me about this...

TITA

But don't you think it's right,

though, that you should see him, at

least once...

SECOND ENGINEER'S VOICE

(miked)

We're ready Miss Dupea.

TITA

(to the booth)

Just a minute, please!

(to Bobby)

Robert, don't you think it's right

that you should see him?

BOBBY

Yeah... I guess so...

TITA

I'm going back up tonight. Will you

go with me?

BOBBY

No...

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I'd rather drive up myself and...

maybe go into Canada after... And I

can't stay long, Tita, probably a

week, at the most.

TITA

I know.

BOBBY

Well...

(then, to Tita)

I better let you...

TITA

Wait...

TITA (CONT'D)

I'll walk out with you...

TITA (CONT'D)

I'll be back in two minutes!

SECOND ENGINEER'S VOICE

Cut that in half, will you?

TITA

They hate me, I feel.

BOBBY

Maybe you better stay, then.

TITA

No, I need to talk to you, about so

many things...

BOBBY

Well, I'll be seeing you in a

couple of days, won't I?

TITA

Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that

you're coming...

BOBBY

Yeah, me, too...

TITA

It'll be so good for you, and for

Daddy, because you know, you've

never really...

BOBBY

(cutting her off)

Tita, I've got to go...

TITA

All right...

TITA (CONT'D)

Okay.

BOBBY

(calling out)

Hello?!

BOBBY (CONT'D)

You have the day off?!

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Are you sick?

BOBBY (CONT'D)

You heard about Elton, I guess.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Okay, I get your point.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Hope you didn't strain yourself,

getting in here and into your pose

before I hit the door.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I have to go home. My father's

sick.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Yeah, it's very funny.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I'll be gone two or three weeks.

RAYETTE

(not looking at him)

You'll be gone, period.

BOBBY

I'll try and call you from up

there.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

(very emotional)

Come on, DiPesto. I never told you

it would work out to anything. Did

I?

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I'll send you some money, that's

all I can do.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

And... I'll call you, like I

said...

(he pauses, then)

Bye, Ray.

BOBBY

Do you want to go with me, Ray?

RAYETTE

"There's been hot spells/An' cold

spells ever since we met/I've seen

your small fires/Your big fires/But

I won't give up yet/Oh someday

you'll yearn/'Cause your heart's

gonna burn/For that old familiar

glow/You'll be burned..."

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

You like it?

BOBBY

I love it.

RAYETTE

(resumes singing)

"You'll be burned out/Or smoked

out/An' come back to me, I know..."

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

"Every trail that you blaze/Makes

me..."

BOBBY

What the hell is that?

RAYETTE

Is it an accident?

BOBBY

Hey! What's going on, what's the

trouble?!

PALM

Rotate, mack!

RAYETTE

What'd she say?

PALM

Look at my car! Piece of shit! I

just bought it brand new from a

used-car lot, and the steering goes

to the pot on me!

BOBBY

You're lucky no one was hurt.

PALM

Seven hundred dollars, down the

toilet! I'd like to go back and

punch the son of a bitch out! Can

you give us a lift?

PALM (CONT'D)

Come on, Terry, we got a ride!

RAYETTE

Jesus, what a rude person...

BOBBY

What's your name?

PALM

Palm Apodaca.

RAYETTE

An' what's your name?

TERRY

Terry Grouse.

BOBBY

(loudly)

What?

RAYETTE

(low tones)

I'll tell you...

(spelling out)

... l-a-t-e-r.

PALM

How far are you going to?

BOBBY

Washington.

PALM

We'll get off in Washington and

hook another ride.

BOBBY

Where are you going?

PALM

Alaska.

BOBBY

Alaska? Are you on vacation?

TERRY

(sullenly)

She wants to live there, because

she thinks it's cleaner.

BOBBY

Cleaner than what?

PALM

(to Terry)

You don't have to tell everybody

about it. Pretty soon they'll all

go there and it won't be so clean.

BOBBY

How do you know it's clean?

PALM

I saw a picture of it. Alaska is

very clean. It appeared to look

very white to me... Don't you

think?

BOBBY

Yeah. That's before the big thaw.

PALM

Before the what?

PALM

I had to leave this place. I got

depressed, seeing all the crap. And

the thing is, they're making more

crap, you know? They've got so many

stores and stuff and junk full of

crap, I can't believe it.

BOBBY

Who?

PALM

Who? People, that's who! Pretty

soon there won't be room for

anyone.

They're selling more crap that

people go and buy than you can

imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe

everybody should have a big hole

where they throw in all this stuff

and burn it.

RAYETTE

There'd never be a hole big enough.

Now took at me, for instance, when

I was just one person, before

Bobby, I had so much garbage

collectin' onto me every day, I was

thinkin' about gettin a dispose

all...

PALM

A dispose-all, what's that but more

crap? I've never seen such crap.

Oofh, I don't know how people get

up in the morning.

TERRY

Mass production is what does it.

PALM

What do you mean "mass"... I have

to come out and tell you, you're

not that clean, either.

TERRY

Wait a minute. I'm not that neat,

maybe, but I am clean.

PALM

Well, you're not that bad, but some

people... I mean, people's homes,

just filth. I've been in people's

homes...

TERRY

In my personal observation, I think

that more people are neat than are

clean...

PALM

In my personal thing, I don't see

that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot

of filth. What they need to do

every day, no, once in a while, is

a cockroach thing, where they spray

the homes. And uh...

can you imagine, if their doors

were painted a pretty color, and

they had a pot outside, with...

TERRY

Yeah, it could be adorable...

PALM

And they picked up! I mean, it

wouldn't be filthy, with Coke

bottles and whiskey, and those

signs everywhere...

PALM (CONT'D)

... they oughta be erased! All

those signs, selling crap, and more

crap, and, I don't know, it's

disgusting, I don't even want to

talk about it!

BOBBY

Well...

PALM

It's just filthy. People are dirty.

I think that's the biggest thing

that's wrong with people. I think

they wouldn't be as violent if they

were clean, because then they

wouldn't have anybody to pick on...

Oofh... Dirt...

RAYETTE

Well...

PALM

Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's

filth. Filth is bad. That's what

starts maggots and riots...

PALM (CONT'D)

Hey, follow that truck. They know

the best places to stop.

RAYETTE

That's an old maid's tale.

PALM

Bullshit! Truck drivers know the

best eating places on the road.

RAYETTE

Salesmen and cops are the ones. If

you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd

know.

PALM

Don't call me "honey," mack.

RAYETTE

Don't call me "mack," honey.

PALM

I wouldn't be a waitress. They're

nasty and full of crap.

RAYETTE

You better hold onto your tongue!

PALM

(giving her the finger)

Hold onto this.

RAYETTE

Just one minute, you! Don't you

ever talk to me like that!

BOBBY

Shut up! All of you!

BOBBY

(looking at his menu)

I'll have an omelette, no potatoes.

Give me tomatoes instead, and wheat

toast instead of rolls.

WAITRESS

No substitutions.

BOBBY

What does that mean? You don't have

any tomatoes?

WAITRESS

(annoyed)

No. We have tomatoes.

BOBBY

But I can't have any. Is that what

you mean?

WAITRESS

Only what's on the menu...

(again, indicating  with

her pencil)

A Number Two: Plain omelette. It

comes with cottage fries and rolls.

BOBBY

I know what it comes with, but

that's not what I want.

WAITRESS

I'll come back when you've made up

your mind...

BOBBY

Wait, I've made up my mind. I want

a plain omelette, forget the

tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the

plate, and give me a side of wheat

toast and a cup of coffee.

WAITRESS

I'm sorry, we don't have side

orders of toast. I can give you an

English muffin or a coffee roll.

BOBBY

What do you mean, you don't have

side orders of toast? You make

sandwiches, don't you?

WAITRESS

Would you like to talk to the

manager?

PALM

Hey, mack!

BOBBY

(to Palm)

Shut up.

(to the waitress)

You have bread, don't you, and a

toaster of some kind?

WAITRESS

I don't make the rules.

BOBBY

Okay, I'll make it as easy for you

as I can. Give me an omelette,

plain, and a chicken salad sandwich

on wheat toast -- no butter, no

mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup

of coffee.

WAITRESS

One Number Two, and a chicken sal

san -- hold the butter, the mayo,

the lettuce -- and a cup of

coffee... Anything else?

BOBBY

Now all you have to do is hold the

chicken, bring me the toast, charge

me for the sandwich, and you

haven't broken any rules.

WAITRESS

(challenging him)

You want me to hold the chicken.

BOBBY

Yeah. I want you to hold it between

your knees.

WAITRESS

You see that sign, sir?!

WAITRESS (CONT'D)

You'll all have to leave, I'm not

taking any more of your smartness

and your sarcasm!

BOBBY

You see this sign?

PALM

Fantastic! That you could figure

all that out, and lay that down on

her, to come up with a way you

could get your toast.

BOBBY

I didn't get it, did I?

PALM

No, but it was very clever... I

would of just punched her out.

PALM

People... Oofh...

(shaking her head in utter

disgust)

Animals are not like that...

They're always cleaning themselves.

Did you ever see... What are they

called? Pigeons!

PALM (CONT'D)

He's always picking on himself and

his friends. They're always picking

bugs out of their hair...

PALM (O.S.)

Monkeys, too.

PALM

Except monkeys do things out in the

open that I don't go for.

PALM

I was in this place once, this

store, with snakes, monkeys,

everything you could imagine. I

walked in, I had to run out. It

stunk! They didn't even have an

incense going...

PALM

And you know, I read where they

invented this car that runs on...

that runs on... when you boil

water...

TERRY

(half-dead)

Steam.

PALM

Right, steam. A car you could ride

around in and not cause a stink.

But do you know, they will not even

let us have it. Can you believe it?

Why?! Man! He likes to create a

stink. I wrote them a note once,

and told them to clean it... I

mean, don't you see that? It's just

filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you

wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a

stink! I don't even want to talk

about it...

RAYETTE

Are you depressed about your daddy,

honey?

BOBBY

No.

RAYETTE

I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?

BOBBY

Is what you?

RAYETTE

You're depressed that I come along.

BOBBY

Who said I was depressed?

RAYETTE

Well, is that a happy face I see?

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

'Cause if it was me, I could just

catch a Greyhound back.

BOBBY

Oh, you're not going to kill

yourself this time. I wish I'd

known...

RAYETTE

I don't know if I'm gonna be able

to sleep or not.

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

(looking over at him)

Hint, hint.

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

(sighing; then:)

I guess I'll just have to count the

sheep.

(closing her eyes)

One-two-three-four...

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

Seven... eight...

(caressing his shoulder)

Look at this old cold shoulder,

what am I gonna do with it?

BOBBY

If you just wouldn't open your

mouth, everything would be fine.

RAYETTE

Tick a lock.

RAYETTE

Why can't I go out to your folks'

house? Give me one good reason.

BOBBY

I have to see how things are first.

My father's sick, you understand?

They wouldn't be prepared for me

bringing anyone.

RAYETTE

So how long am I supposed to sit

an' twiddle my thumbs in this

place?

BOBBY

If you can't do what I ask, Ray,

use that money to go back home,

then.

RAYETTE

Bobby, don't talk like that...

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

It'll be all right, I'll get a hold

a some magazines an' things like

that. An' maybe find a beauty salon

an' get my hair fixed, okay?

BOBBY

Okay, Ray...

RAYETTE

Or maybe sit out by the pool an'

get myself nice an' tan for you.

Would you like that?

BOBBY

(starting the engine)

Sure...

RAYETTE

It brings out my eyes...

BOBBY

Bye, honey, I'll call you in a

couple of days.

RAYETTE

Okay...

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

Bye, baby...

BOBBY

He doesn't even know who the hell I

am.

TITA

Remember, Bobby, what mother used

to say when...

CATHERINE

(to Bobby)

How long have you been...

(To Tita)

Oh, excuse me...

TITA

No, it's all right, you go ahead...

CATHERINE

I was just going to ask Robert how

long he's been away from here.

BOBBY

Four or five years.

CARL

No, the last time was three years

ago.

TITA

Oh no, it's been much more than

that.

CARL

Away from the piano, Tita, you have

no sense of time at all.

TITA

I don't think that's true.

CARL

It is true.

TITA

Besides being very rude.

CATHERINE

What have you been doing since

then?

BOBBY

What have I been doing? Different

things, different jobs, here and

there. Nothing that interesting.

CATHERINE

And you no longer play at all?

CARL

You know, just after I came back

off tour with the Betenthaller

Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert

had a summit conference about

you...

TITA

Oh, my, "a summit conference." I

wonder where I was, polishing

silver behind the coal bin.

CARL

I don't know where you were, penis

envy.

TITA

I hope I didn't hear that.

CARL

At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a

private detective to ferret you

out, and I said, "What for?"

Whatever the hell he's doing, even

if it's a completely wasteful

escapade, it's entirely his

business. Simple as that...

BOBBY

Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.

TITA

I don't think you should infer

Daddy was wrong in front of him...

TITA (CONT'D)

Don't force him like that, Spicer.

BOBBY

(to Catherine)

How long have you been staying

here?

TITA

A couple of months.

CARL

Did you hear about my misfortune,

Robert?

BOBBY

What?

CARL

It's still nearly impossible for me

to turn my neck. If I wanted to

turn toward Catherine, for

instance, I'd first have to twist

the whole base of my body around...

(demonstrating)

... like this...

CATHERINE

I wouldn't mind doing a little

work, if you're finished, and not

too tired...

CARL

No, I'm finished...

(placing a hand on his

stomach)

Satiety is my father and mother.

CARL (CONT'D)

She's tremendously gifted, this

girl.

BOBBY

(looking at her)

Is she?

CATHERINE

Excuse me, I don't want to hear

this...

CARL

I hope you feel at home, Robert.

(patting him on the

shoulder)

I'm really glad you're here.

BOBBY

Thanks, Carl...

TITA

He has ways of communicating,

Robert. I can tell when he's

expressing approval or disapproval,

just from his eyes...

BOBBY

Uhm hmm. Some range.

TITA

It's not that bad.

BOBBY

Yes, it is. I can't take seeing

him, sitting there like a stone.

TITA

A week or two isn't going to ruin

your life, for Godsakes.

TITA (CONT'D)

I mean, you think I'm that happy?

BOBBY

No, I don't.

(a pause, then:)

You should've left a long time ago.

TITA

We can't all get up and leave, can

we? I mean, there are certain needs

you have to respond to...

TITA (CONT'D)

And anyway, I want you to stay, so

I can spend some time with you, and

ask you some questions...

BOBBY

What questions?

TITA

Well, do you -- I mean, have you

enjoyed all these... strange things

you've been doing?

BOBBY

Sometimes.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Why? Am I some kind of freak to you

or something?

TITA

No, no, I don't think that, I'm

just curious about it...

(a pause)

Do you think I'm a freak?

BOBBY

Sort of.

TITA

Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I

look?

BOBBY

No, I don't really think you're a

freak.

TITA

I probably am, but I don't care. I

mean, I wasn't that blessed to

begin with, and when would I have

had time to make any

improvements...

BOBBY

What about Carl and Catherine? Is

he just coaching her, or what?

TITA

Constantly. Night and day. And

unless I get up before the birds, I

can't get in any practice time for

myself...

BOBBY

Uhm hmm.

TITA

Actually, it's very admirable, the

way she works. She'll probably be

enormously successful, because

she's attractive as well, not that

that's so important in music,

but...

BOBBY

You're attractive, Tita. If you

just did a little more with

yourself...

TITA

Like what?

BOBBY

Well, if you just maybe did

something with your hair, or...

TITA

Oh, let's not talk about my hair,

it does what it wants to, and

anyway, who cares, I want to talk

about you...

BOBBY

There's nothing to say, Tita...

TITA

Well, you're not going to run out

on me right away, are you?

BOBBY

I don't know.

TITA

Oh God, don't sneak up on me like

that!

BOBBY

Sorry.

CATHERINE

Hello...

BOBBY

I guess you fell in the water.

CATHERINE

(amused)

Yes, intentionally.

BOBBY

That's dangerous, you know.

CATHERINE

Swimming?

BOBBY

Playing piano all day and then

jumping into cold water. You could

get a cramp.

CATHERINE

I love to swim, and I don't mind

the cold at all. It's invigorating.

BOBBY

Well, I wouldn't want to get too

invigorated myself.

CATHERINE

Why?

BOBBY

What would I do with it? Run amok?

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Besides piano and swimming, what

else do you do?

CATHERINE

Well, there's fishing and boating.

There's concerts on the mainland

and... but I feel silly telling

you. This is really your home. You

probably know better than I what

there is to do.

BOBBY

Nothing.

CATHERINE

Nothing? Then it must be very

boring for you here.

BOBBY

That's right. Have you anything to

suggest?

CATHERINE

I don't know. Let me give it some

thought.

BOBBY

What're you doing right now...

CATHERINE

Right now I'm going to run a hot

tub and soak myself.

BOBBY

Then after that?

CATHERINE

After that, I plan to read some

music and rest for awhile.

BOBBY

Tomorrow, then.

CATHERINE

Tomorrow's a full practice day...

(continues up the stairs)

But the day after is kind of open.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.

BOBBY

(as if it were a year)

The day after tomorrow.

CATHERINE

If you're free.

BOBBY

Yeah, I'll probably be free.

TITA

Don't laugh...

TITA (CONT'D)

What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate

anything...

CARL

I took some aspirin and it really

upset my stomach.

CATHERINE

One thing that's hard to understand

is how you could have this

incredible background in music, and

then just walk away from it,

without a second thought...

BOBBY

I gave it a second thought.

TITA

He looks tired to me, Spicer. I

think you should put him to bed.

CATHERINE

I mean, how could you not play

anymore? That's so strange to me...

BOBBY

I have played a few times. Here and

there. As a matter of fact, I was

once a rehearsal pianist for a Las

Vegas musical revue.

CATHERINE

You don't call that music, though.

BOBBY

Of course I do. It's music. You

know...

CARL

Robert, do you mind?

BOBBY

What?

CARL

Nothing. Will you excuse us for a

while?

CATHERINE

We really don't have to, Carl, if

you're not feeling good...

CARL

(a bit martyred)

Well, maybe if we put the

Thermaphore on me for a while,

first...

CATHERINE

Oh, all right.

TITA

Do you want some gingerbread?

BOBBY

(elsewhere)

What?

TITA

With applesauce?

BOBBY

No, thanks...

BOBBY

Yeah, well fine, you know what I

suggest, Ray...

(listening)

Because I don't know how long.

Things are not going that well

here...

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Yeah, well I'm not having any fun,

either, so why don't you...

(pause)

No, you can't, it's just not

convenient, and I have to get

off...

(listening impatiently)

Ray, I really have to go, I have to

get off now...

(longer pause)

Another couple of days, maybe. I'll

call you and let you --

(pause)

All right, if you're gone, you're

gone. Now I have to get off, okay?

(pause)

Bye, Ray...

CARL

Only 10 minutes of playing and it's

already killing my neck...

BOBBY

You sure you should be playing,

Carl?

CARL

What do you mean? Aside from my

neck, I'm in superb shape.

BOBBY

(serving)

I don't know, there's something

wrong with the way you move.

CARL

I'm not aware of it. Like what?

BOBBY

Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I'd hate to see you walk across a

concert stage like that.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Two -- Nineteen.

CARL

(irritated with Bobby)

I've walked across a stage a number

of times, without exciting any

particular response...

BOBBY

That's what I mean...

CARL

Any particular humor, I meant.

BOBBY

(returning)

I think you should get someone to

coach you how to walk. I think it's

a substantial problem.

CARL

Dammit!

BOBBY

Look at that.

TITA

Why are you being so mean?

BOBBY

I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't

you see that?

TITA

I don't think I'd notice. I'm so

used to Carl.

BOBBY

(wanting to go on about

it)

Yeah, well, he's...

TITA

Bobby? Do you think Spicer is

attractive?

BOBBY

I think he's got a terrific

personality.

TITA

You know, he was formerly a sailor.

BOBBY

Look, can't you see that, what I'm

talking about?

TITA

Sailors are sadistic, I feel.

CARL

See? There's nothing wrong with the

way I walk. Now where are we?

BOBBY

At game, Carl.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

That's three games to none, Carl.

CARL

All right, let's have a rematch.

BOBBY

I thought you had to go to the

mainland today. Aren't you going to

miss the ferry?

CARL

Too bad. Just when I was hitting my

stride.

CARL (CONT'D)

Say goodbye to Catherine for me,

will you?

TITA

Can I play now?

CARL

Tell her I'll be back sometime

tomorrow!

BOBBY

Where is she, anyway?

TITA

(ignoring the question)

My turn.

BOBBY

Why don't you and Spicer play?

CATHERINE

That was beautiful, Robert. I'm

surprised...

BOBBY

Thank you.

CATHERINE

I was really very moved by the way

you...

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

Is that funny?

BOBBY

It wasn't supposed to be, it just

struck me that way.

CATHERINE

Why?

BOBBY

Nothing. It's just that... I picked

the easiest piece I could remember.

I think I first played it when I

was 8 years old and I played it

better then.

CATHERINE

It doesn't matter. It was the

feeling I was affected by.

BOBBY

I didn't have any.

CATHERINE

You had no inner feeling?

BOBBY

None.

CATHERINE

Then I must have been supplying it.

BOBBY

Wait...

CATHERINE

Well, at least you're accomplished

at something...

BOBBY

What?

CATHERINE

At being a fake.

BOBBY

Catherine...

CATHERINE

No, you're very good at it. I'm

really impressed.

BOBBY

Shit.

BOBBY

You think I'm a fake.

CATHERINE

I think it's what you think.

BOBBY

No, it isn't what I think.

CATHERINE

Look... You made a very calculated

move, and then made me feel

embarrassed for responding to you.

That wasn't necessary.

BOBBY

Yes, it was. You've made it clear

that if I can cut a little piano, I

might get a little response.

CATHERINE

(stops and turns to him)

I don't think that's accurate...

BOBBY

Up to now, what I've been getting

from you are meaningful looks over

the dinner table and a lot of vague

suggestions about the day after

tomorrow...

CATHERINE

I'm not conscious of having given

you any meaningful looks. And as

for the day after tomorrow, this is

the day after tomorrow, and I am,

unfortunately, seeing you... Now if

you'll excuse me, I'd like to take

a bath.

BOBBY

It's convenient to fake looking for

something right now, isn't it?

CATHERINE

I'm not faking anything. I'm

looking for some bath oil...

BOBBY

Some bath oil?

BOBBY (CONT'D)

What about this one?

(picking up another)

Or this one?

(and another)

How about some jasmine?

(and another)

What about some musk?

CATHFRINE

What are you doing!

BOBBY

(knocking the bottles

over)

What are you doing, screwing around

with this crap?!

CATHERINE

I don't find your language that

charming.

BOBBY

It's direct, anyway, which seems to

be difficult for you.

CATHERINE

I'd like you to leave now. Is that

direct enough?

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

You're not a serious person, by

your own admission. And that may be

interesting, but it doesn't

interest me...

BOBBY

Serious, that's what's important to

you?

CATHERINE

Yes, that's what's important to

me...

BOBBY

Okay, let's be serious...

CATHERINE

No, don't do that...

BOBBY

Shut up...

CATHERINE

No inner feeling.

BOBBY

That's right.

CATHERINE

I don't believe vou.

CATHERINE

I married him when I was 17. He was

a cellist, and I thought he was the

most brilliant man I'd ever met...

And I'm sure he was, because at

that age, I hadn't met that many...

But he was insidious, you know. He

had me convinced that I was a

mediocrity, musically, as a woman,

as an intellect. But in this

completely imperceptible, pleasant

way, so that you weren't even sure

he was doing it. Anyway, I just

woke up one morning and I said, you

know something Joseph, you're full

of beans, and I left him...

BOBBY

That's what you said?

CATHERINE

Something witty and devastating

like that.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

As a matter of fact, he's the one

who introduced me to Carl...

(a pause, then:)

How are you?

BOBBY

I'm fine.

CATHERINE

Carl restored my confidence. He

really did. He's much more

substantial than you give him

credit for.

BOBBY

Is he?

CATHERINE

Yes.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

Do you think you could discreetly

move across the hall now?

BOBBY

Yeah, I think I could.

CATHERINE

Robert?

BOBBY

What?

CATHERINE

I could spend some time with you

tomorrow morning, before Carl comes

back, I mean, if you'd like to.

BOBBY

Of course I'd like to.

RAYETTE

You certainly do have a beautiful

piece a real estate out here, Mr.

Dupea.

RAYETTE

(turning to Bobby)

Can he hear me?

TITA

(politely)

He's not hard of hearing.

RAYETTE

Well, that's a blessing, at least.

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

This certainly is an improvement on

the motel an' the coffee shop.

(to Bobby)

How could you have left such a

beautiful place, Bobby?

BOBBY

I don't know.

CARL

You've been staying in a motel all

this time?

RAYETTE

For two whole weeks, an' there

wasn't hardly nobody there to talk

to but me.

The manager of the place told me it

was the off season, an' it must a

ben, because other'n me, there was

just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon,

that didn't appear to be all there,

an' this old married pair next to

me that was always hollerin' for

quiet. Can you imagine? All you

could a heard there was a pin, an'

them, hollerin' away...

CARL

I don't understand why you had to

stay in a motel. There's more than

enough room here.

RAYETTE

Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby

said he hadda kind of feel things

up here first, which I can

understand, but then it went an'

took so long, I ran flat outa

money...

(to Bobby)

I didn't have no number to call,

you know.

(to Carl)

So I hadda clear outa there an'

come on up here, in the hopes that

I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...

CARL

Oh, no. You're more than welcome.

RAYETTE

Well, thank you, that's a very nice

thing for you to say.

CARL

Not at all.

RAYETTE

That certainly is a beautiful head

a hair you have.

CATHERINE

Thank you.

RAYETTE

Is it natural?

BOBBY

Rayette.

RAYETTE

What?

BOBBY

Just finish eating.

RAYETTE

Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?

CARL

No, you're not. Go ahead and take

your time.

RAYETTE

I do eat slow as a bird, whereas

Bobby can put it away like a speed

swing...

(to Tita)

Is there any ketchup around?

BOBBY

Oh, for chrissakes...

CARL

Robert, let's not be rude, okay?

RAYETTE

It's all right. He don't mean

anything by that.

BOBBY

I don't, huh?

RAYETTE

I guess Bobby's just about the

moodiest man I ever ben with...

BOBBY

Where are you going?

CATHERINE

I'm going to pick up some friends

of Carl's. Are you all right?

BOBBY

I have to talk to you.

CATHERINE

I'll be back later...

BOBBY

No, I want to talk to you now. I

have to explain something about...

CATHERINE

No, you don't have to, it isn't

necessary...

BOBBY

(overlapping her)

Yes, it is!

DRIVER

Come on, get moving, dammit!!

BOBBY

(turning around to him)

Will you shut up for a minute!!

(to Catherine)

Pull your car out of line.

CATHERINE

No, I can't...

BOBBY

Will you let me talk to you,

please?

CATHERINE

I can't do that. I haven't been

being fair to Carl. I have to tell

you that.

BOBBY

(barely audible)

Oh. You have to tell me that.

CATHERINE

What?! I can't hear you!

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

I'm sorry everything's been so

confusing, but I have to go,

Robert...

BOBBY

Catherine...

CATHERINE

Please, I'll see you later this

evening.

SAMIA

But the point is, man is born into

the world with a pre-existent

adversary, both real and imaginary,

so you'd have to say that

aggression was one of his primary,

psychic inheritances, which...

FINCHER

If I may beg to differ...

SAMIA

Beg all you like, John, but the

fact remains that man takes

enormous delight in aggressive

acts, as well as the portrayal of

aggressive acts, and to be

triumphant over another no matter

how, seems fundamental to his

having a sense of well being, as

well as...

FINCHER

No, I don't quarrel with your

inference, but you draw too long a

bow in your conclusions, which seem

unnecessarily harsh and...

SAMIA

Well, I don't make poetry. As an

analyst, I...

RAYETTE

Is there a TV in the house?

SAMIA

John believes in the basic goodness

of man, and that's fine, but gaze

into the pit like I have and that

view seems a little soporific. And

not unlike television, it hardly

represents the real world...

RAYETTE

There's some good things on it,

though.

SAMIA

Pardon me?

RAYETTE

The TV. There's some good things on

it, sometimes.

SAMIA

I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't

really discussing media...

FINCHER

If you really hold such bleak

views, how can you, in good

conscience, carry on a practice?

SAMIA

Oh, there's always hope, I think,

for a few individuals, if they're

courageous enough to shed their

illusions and their...

CATHERINE

(cutting her off)

And what about love?

SAMIA

What about it? Wouldn't you agree

that a great deal of mischief has

been done in the name of love?

CATHERINE

No, I wouldn't.

SAMIA

Well, you're a romantic, Catherine,

as are most musicians, and what's

more, about to be married...

SAMIA

... which should exclude you from

any objective discussion. But keep

in mind, even the arts aren't free

of aggressive content, nor the

institution of marriage.

CATHERINE

I think these cold, "objective"

discussions are aggressive,

Samia...

SAMIA

But I'd like to say, so that I

don't dampen the spirit of your

adventure...

CATHERINE

(cutting her off)

You haven't dampened my spirit,

Samia... Excuse me.

SAMIA

Well, I should hope not...

SAMIA (CONT'D)

Because obviously there are loftier

classes of people that do establish

a kind of relating, that's

relatively free of... (Etc.)

RAYETTE

What kind of doggy is that?

CARL

It's a Borzoi.

RAYETTE

Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat

once, that Bobby give me...

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

Remember, Bobby?! The little

pussycat you gave me?!

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

She had four little white paws, an'

oh, was I crazy over her. We hadda

go an' leave her one time at some

friends, an' she went out an' got

smashed flatter'n a tortilla right

outside their mobile home.

SAMIA

There. You see what I mean?

SAMIA (CONT'D)

The choice of words, "squashed

flat," juxtaposed against the image

of a fluffy kitten...

RAYETTE

Well, she was.

SAMIA

Perhaps...

SAMIA (CONT'D)

But you see how close that is to

what I'm trying to...

BOBBY

Don't sit there pointing at her.

SAMIA

I beg your pardon.

BOBBY

(advancing on her)

I said, don't point at her like

that! What gives you the right to

sit there and tell anybody about

class and who the hell's got it,

and what she typifies! You

shouldn't even be in the same room

with her, you creep!

SAMIA

Carl, this is really too much...

BOBBY

(to Samia)

You're totally full of shit!

CARL

Robert, I think you better just...

BOBBY

(cutting him off)

You're all full of shit!

RAYETTE

Bobby...

BOBBY

(moving past her)

I can't talk to you right now,

leave me alone...

BOBBY

Tita, what the hell are you doing?!

SPICER

Hey, this is my room.

BOBBY

(moving over to the bed)

What's going on here!?

TITA

It's none of your business!

BOBBY

Where's Catherine?!

TITA

I don't know where she is!

SPICER

Don't you believe in knocking, pal?

BOBBY

I'm talking to you, Tita!

TITA

(close to tears)

Can't I have anything to myself,

dammit?!

SPICER

(grabbing hold of him

again)

Come on now, out!

BOBBY

(struggling with him)

Keep your fucking hands off my

sister, nurse!

SPICER

Did you hear me! Move out!!

TITA

Stop it! Bobby, will just you stop!

I mean it!

SPICER

Hold it, just hold it!!

TITA

Carl! Somebody get Carl!

SPICER

Take it easy, dammit!

TITA

Stop it! Right now! Just stop it!!

Carl!!

SPICER

Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up!

Give up! Give up!

TITA

Oh God, Bobby, look what you've

done...

BOBBY

I just wanted to talk to you for a

minute.

CATHERINE

No. It's useless, Robert. It

wouldn't work, not ever...

BOBBY

Just give me a chance, will you?

CATHERINE

I'm trying to be delicate with you,

but you're not understanding me.

It's not just because of Carl, or

my music, but because of you...

(she looks at him)

I mean, what would it come to? If a

person has no love for himself, no

respect, no love for his work, his

family, his friends, something...

How can he ask for love in return?

I mean, why should he ask for it?

BOBBY

And living out here, in this rest

home asylum, that's what you want?

CATHERINE

Yes.

BOBBY

(looking back to her)

That'll make you happy.

CATHERINE

I hope it will, yes.

(she pauses, then:)

I'm sorry.

BOBBY

Okay.

BOBBY

Are you cold?

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I don't know if you'd be

particularly interested in hearing

anything about me. My life, I

mean... Most of it doesn't add up

to much... that I could relate as a

way of life that you'd approve

of...

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I'd like to be able to tell you

why, but I don't really... I mean,

I move around a lot because things

tend to get bad when I stay. And

I'm looking... for auspicious

beginnings, I guess...

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I'm trying to, you know, imagine

your half of this conversation...

My feeling is, that if you could

talk, we probably wouldn't be

talking. That's pretty much how it

got to be before. I left...

(another pause)

Are you all right?

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I don't know what to say...

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Tita suggested that we try to... I

don't know. I think that she...

seems to feel we've got... some

understanding to reach... She

totally denies the fact that we

were never that comfortable with

each other to begin with...

(pauses, trying to gain

control)

The best I can do, is apologize.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

We both know I was never really

that good at it, anyway...

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I'm sorry it didn't work out.

TITA

Bobby!

TITA (CONT'D)

You're leaving?

BOBBY

Yeah. I said a week, and I've

overstayed myself...

TITA

You were going without saying

goodbye?

BOBBY

I didn't want to say goodbye to

anyone.

TITA

But what about me?

BOBBY

(smiling at her)

I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.

TITA

Just once in a while, call and tell

me where you are, please...

RAYETTE'S VOICE

Watch the birdie!

BOBBY

Bye, now.

TITA

(tearing up)

Bye, Robert.

BOBBY

Come on.

RAYETTE

(resisting him)

Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a

picture of you an' me in front of

the place...

BOBBY

No, let's go...

RAYETTE

I never got the chance to thank you

all for your hospitality. You tell

Carl for me, if any of you folks

wanta come on down to our place

anytime, you'd be more'n welcome...

TITA

Thank you, that's very nice.

RAYETTE

Bye bye, now.

RAYETTE

"Your kiss is like a drink when I'm

thirsty/An' I'm thirsty for you

with all my heart..."

RAYETTE

"But don't love me/Then act as

though we've never kissed/Oh, don't

touch me..."

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

"Don't touch me..."

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

"Don't touch me..."

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

"Don't touch me..."

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

"Oh, don't touch..."

BOBBY

Cut it out!

RAYETTE

Son of a bitch, Bobby! You quit

pushin' me away like that! I've had

enough a that to last me a

lifetime!

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

Whyn't you just try an' be good to

me for a change!?

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

There id'n anyone gonna look after

you an' love you better'n I do, you

know that.

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

Baby? Did you hear me?

RAYETTE

I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get

some coffee. You want anything?

BOBBY

No.

RAYETTE

You got any change?

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

Don't you just have 50 cents or

somethin'?

RAYETTE (CONT'D)

Okay, be right back...

RAYETTE

Sure you don't want anything?

BOBBY

(to attendant)

Fill it up.

BOBBY

(faintly audible)

Hey, wait a minute.

DRIVER

Haven't you got a jacket or

anything with you?

BOBBY

No, I don't, I uh... it got burned

up. Everything in the car got the

shit burned out of it. All I got

left is what I have on...

DRIVER

I've got an extra jacket behind the

seat, if you want to put it on.

BOBBY

No, it's okay.

DRIVER

Suit yourself. But I'll tell you,

where we're headed is gonna get

colder'n hell.

BOBBY

It's all right. I'm fine.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I'm all right.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I'm fine.

THE END
