JERRY

Strong stuff.

ROD

(to JACOB, a soldier

squatting several yards

away)

Hey, Professor, how many times can

you shit in an hour?

GEORGE

Don't bug 'im.

DOUG

Where are those gooks already?

FRANK

Some offensive. I don't even think

they're out there.

PAUL

Jesus, this grass is something else.

ROD

Why even bother to pull 'em up?

FRANK

You jackin' off out there again, huh

Jake?

PAUL

Hey, get off his back.

ROD

It's called philosophizing, right

Professor?

JACOB

Up yours, you adolescent scum.

SERGEANT (V.O.)

Mount your bayonets.

FRANK

(frightened)

Oh shit!

PAUL

Goddam!

ROD

Gimme that joint!

JERRY

Hey, something's wrong.

GEORGE

What is it?

JERRY

My head.

GEORGE

It's nerves. Take another toke.

ROD

What's going on?

JERRY

Help me! Help me!

PAUL

What the hell ... ?

PAUL

God Almighty!

PAUL

Good God! What's happening?

ROD

Behind you! Look out! This is it!

JACOB

Don't leave me.

PAUL

They're coming!

JACOB

Excuse me, do you know if we've

passed Nostrand Avenue yet?

(she doesn't answer)

Excuse me.

(she does not

acknowledge his

existence)

Look, I'm asking a simple question.

Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell

asleep.

WOMAN

(speaking with a Puerto

Rican accent)

I no from around here.

JACOB

(glad for a response)

Yeah, you and everyone else.

JACOB

Goddam it.

JACOB

No way!

JACOB

Goddam fucking city!

CUT TO:

JACOB

Hey, is someone in there?

BOUND MAN

Fuck off! Mind your own business!

MAN

You cocksucker! Get outta here.

JEZZIE (V.O.)

Jake, is that you?

JACOB

What the hell did you do, move all

the furniture?

JEZZIE (V.O.)

Why didn't you turn on the light?

JACOB

I didn't want to wake you.

JEZZIE (V.O.)

(sleepy but pleasant)

Gee, thanks a lot.

JACOB

Where is the lamp?

JEZZIE (V.O.)

Where are you?

JACOB

If I knew I wouldn't have to ask.

What did you do? I was happy the way

it was.

JEZZIE (V.O.)

I moved the couch. That's all.

JACOB

Where to?

JEZZIE

That help?

JACOB

(nearly sprawled over

the couch)

Thanks.

JEZZIE

What do you think?

JACOB

What do you mean?

JEZZIE

The room!

JACOB

Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.

JEZZIE

It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come

you're so late?

JACOB

Roberts didn't show up. What could I

say? Besides, it's double time.

JEZZIE

(seeing the grease on

his uniform)

What happened to you?

JACOB

(unbuttoning his shirt

as he walks to the

BATHROOM)

Don't ask.

JACOB

Help me. Someone.

JEZZIE

You up?

JACOB

No. Have you seen my glasses?

JEZZIE

(shaking her head)

Where'd you leave 'em?

JACOB

I don't know.

JEZZIE

Did you look around the headboard?

JACOB

(wearily)

Jezzie, I can't see.

JEZZIE

(she scans the shelf)

Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.

JACOB

Thanks.

(he puts on his glasses

and notices the bag)

What's that?

JEZZIE

Your kid dropped it off.

JACOB

Who? Jed?

JEZZIE

(stooping to pick up the

phone)

No. The little one.

JACOB

Eli. Why can't you remember their

names?

JEZZIE

They're weird names.

JACOB

They're Biblical. They were prophets.

JEZZIE

Well, personally, I never went for

church names.

JACOB

And where do you think Jezebel comes

from?

JEZZIE

I don't let anybody call me that.

JACOB

(shaking his head)

You're a real heathen, you know that,

Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get

involved with such a ninny?

JEZZIE

You sold your soul, remember? That's

what you told me.

JACOB

Yeah, but for what?

JEZZIE

A good lay.

JACOB

And look what I got.

JEZZIE

The best.

JACOB

I must have been out of my head.

JEZZIE

Jake, you are never out of your head!

JACOB

(ignoring the criticism

and reaching for the

paper bag)

What's in here?

JEZZIE

Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss

'em so "what's his name" brought 'em

over on his way to school.

JACOB

Look at these, will ya? I don't

believe it. Jesus, these are

fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ...

And here's my brother, when we were

down in Florida.

JEZZIE

Lemme see.

JACOB

(rummaging excitedly

through the pile)

Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when

I was still at City College.

JEZZIE

(looking closely)

That's Sarah?

(she studies the photo)

I can see what you mean.

JACOB

What?

JEZZIE

Why you left.

JACOB

What do you mean you can see?

JEZZIE

Look at her face. A real bitch.

JACOB

She looked good then.

JEZZIE

Not to me.

JACOB

Well, you didn't marry her.

JEZZIE

What's wrong?

JEZZIE

Is that the one who died?

JACOB

(nodding)

Gabe.

JACOB

(continuing)

Sorry. it just took me by surprise. I

didn't expect to see him this morning

... God, what I wouldn't ... He was

the cutest little guy. Like an angel,

you know. He had this smile ...

(choking up again)

Fuck, I don't even remember this

picture.

JACOB

Wait. Don't.

JEZZIE

I don't like things that make you

cry.

JACOB

I just want to look ...

JACOB

God, this is me!

(he holds up a baby

photo)

Look. It's dated right after I was

born.

(he stares at it

intently)

What a kid. Cute, huh? So much

promise.

JEZZIE

It's amazing, huh Jake? Your whole

life ... right in front of you.

(she pauses before

making her final

pronouncement)

What a mess!

JACOB

Ready?

JEZZIE

Just gettin' rid of the garbage.

WOMAN

Where do you expect me to put those?

I don't have any room.

WOMAN

(continuing)

How 'bout over there?

(she points to a table)

No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to

the back room.

JACOB

They're awfully heavy.

WOMAN

I know. That's why I'm asking.

JACOB

(huffing and puffing)

Where's Wong?

WOMAN

That's what I'd like to know. If you

see him on the street somewhere, tell

him he's fired.

JACOB

How was Palm Springs?

WOMAN

Hot. Where do I sign?

JACOB

(pointing to the line)

You got a nice tan, though.

WOMAN

Tan? What tan? It faded on the

airplane. I'd try to get my money

back, but who do you ask?

(she looks heavenward)

Two hundred dollars a night, for

what?

JACOB

No. I'll take the other one.

(he takes it)

Right. Well it's good to have you

back. See you tomorrow, probably.

WOMAN

If you're lucky.

JACOB

Goddamn it! What the hell ... ?

WINO

(pleading)

I didn't take nothin'. I was just

napping. Don't hit me. I was cold.

JACOB

(lifting the man up)

What the hell do you think you're

doing? You can't do this. This is

government property.

WINO

Don't throw me out. They're gonna get

me. They'll tear me to pieces.

JACOB

Come on. You can't stay here.

WINO

Please! I never hurt anybody when I

was alive. Believe me. I don't belong

here.

JACOB

New York!

JEZZIE

Jake!

JACOB

How's it going?

JACOB

(continuing)

I'm going home.

JEZZIE

What's wrong?

JACOB

I don't know. One of these days, I'm

gonna see Louis. My back's killing

me.

JEZZIE

Now? What about the boss? He's not

gonna like it.

JEZZIE

(continuing)

Well, I'll miss riding home with you.

I was looking forward to it.

JACOB

I'll be glad to avoid the crush.

JEZZIE

I enjoy crushing into you.

JACOB

Gently. My back.

LOUIS

Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.

JACOB

How do you know?

LOUIS

I know you. How come you're so tense

today?

JACOB

What can I tell you?

LOUIS

I saw Sarah the other day.

JACOB

Her knee acting up?

LOUIS

A bit.

JACOB

What did she have to say?

LOUIS

Turn on your right side.

(he turns on his left)

How about the other "right?"

(JACOB turns back)

I don't understand you philosphers.

You've got the whole world figured

out but you can't remember the

difference between right and left.

JACOB

I was absent the day they taught that

in school. What did she say?

LOUIS

Who?

JACOB

Sarah.

LOUIS

Not much. She's like you that way.

Two clams. No wonder your marriage

didn't last. Put your hand under your

head. Take a breath and then let it

out.

LOUIS

(continuing)

Ah, good. Now turn to your left.

JACOB

She talk about the boys?

LOUIS

She says she can't get them new coats

because you haven't sent the alimony

for three months.

JACOB

She told you that?

(he shakes his head)

Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm

still paying for the orthodontist?

I'll bet she didn't mention that.

LOUIS

She said you were a son of a bitch

and she regrets the day she set eyes

on you.

JACOB

I thought you said she didn't say

much.

LOUIS

She didn't. That's about all she

said. Put your hand up. Good. I think

she still loves you. Take a breath

and let it out.

JACOB

Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind

word about me in years!

LOUIS

Right. She doesn't stop talking about

you. You're always on her mind.

That's love, Jake.

JACOB

She hates me, Louis.

LOUIS

You should go back to her.

JACOB

What? She threw me out, remember. She

wanted some professor to carry her

far away from Brooklyn. Only we

didn't make it. She can't forgive me

that she still lives in the same

house she grew up in.

LOUIS

Her problem is that you spent eight

years getting a PhD and then went to

work for the post office.

JACOB

What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam

I didn't want to think anymore. I

decided my brain was too small an

organ to comprehend this chaos.

LOUIS

(looking at JACOB with

affection)

If it was any other brain but yours,

I might agree. Relax, this is going

to be strong.

JACOB

I can't relax.

LOUIS

Wiggle your toes.

MAN

I found one. He's alive.

JACOB

God almighty. What did you do to me?

LOUIS

I had to get in there. A deep

adjustment. Rest a moment and let it

set a bit.

JACOB

I had this weird flash just then.

LOUIS

What?

JACOB

I don't know. I've been having them

recently.

(he thinks a moment,

then changes the

subject)

You know, you look like an angel,

Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone

ever tell you that?

LOUIS

Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No

more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back

won't take it. You tell your girl

friend to calm down if she knows

what's good for you.

JACOB

Louis, you're a life saver.

LOUIS

I know.

JACOB

When there are gray skies, I don't

mind the gray skies, as long as

there's you ...

GIRL

(shaking her tits,

singing)

"Hey, Mr. Postman ... "

YOUNG MAN

Look out!

YOUNG MAN

Jump!

JEZZIE

Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake.

The money. Things like that. Or your

wife.

JACOB

Why do you bring her up?

JEZZIE

'Cause she's always on your mind.

JACOB

When was the last time I said a word?

JEZZIE

It has nothin' to do with talkin'.

JEZZIE

(continuing)

Or maybe it's the war.

JEZZIE

(continuing)

It's still there, Jake.

(she points to his

brain)

Even if you never say a word about

it. You can't spend two years in

Vietnam ...

JACOB

(annoyed)

What does that have to do with

anything? Does it explain the

barricaded subway stations? Does it

explain those Godforsaken creatures?

JEZZIE

New York is filled with creatures.

Everywhere. And lots of stations are

closed.

JACOB

They're like demons, Jez.

JEZZIE

Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos

and bag ladies. Low life. That's all

they are. The streets are crawling

with 'em. Don't make em into

somethin' they're not.

(she rubs his forehead)

It's the pressure, honey. That's all

it is.

JACOB

Those guys tried to kill me tonight.

They were aiming right at me.

JEZZIE

Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the

time.

JACOB

They weren't human!

JEZZIE

Come on. What were they, Jake?

JEZZIE

You still love me?

JEZZIE

Says here the world's comin' to an

end. The battle of heaven and hell

they call it. Should be quite a show;

fireworks, H-bombs, and everything.

You believe them, Jake?

JEZZIE

(continuing)

Me neither ... God, look at this. Two

heads. Only lived two days. A day for

each head. Could you imagine me with

two heads? We'd probably keep each

other up all night - arguing and

whatnot. You wanna see the picture?

JEZZIE

(continuing)

Goddamn you son-of-a-bitch! My

uncle's dogs used to treat me better

than you do. At least they'd lick my

toes once in a while. At least they

showed some fucking interest.

JEZZIE

All right! All right! All right!

JEZZIE

You love me?

JEZZIE

(continuing)

Della's party's tonight. Why don't we

go? It'll take your minf offa things.

And I won't make you dance. I

promise. Huh?

(he nods his head in

consent. JEZZIE hugs

him)

You still love me, Jake?

JACOB

I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson,

please.

RECEPTIONIST

Carlson? Is he new here?

JACOB

New? He's been here for years.

RECEPTIONIST

Not according to my charts. Do you

have an appointment?

JACOB

(shaking his head)

Look, I need to see him. I know where

his room is. Just give me a pass. I

won't be long. Ten minutes.

RECEPTIONIST

Our doctors are seen by appointment

only.

JACOB

Damn it. I was in the veteran's out-

patient program. He knows me.

RECEPTIONIST

(not happy)

What's your name?

JACOB

Jacob Singer.

RECEPTIONIST

I'm sorry but there's no record of a

Jacob Singer in our files.

JACOB

Whataya mean, no record?

RECEPTIONIST

You want me to spell it out? There's

nothing here.

JACOB

That's ridiculous. I've been coming

here for years. Listen to me. I'm

going out of my fucking mind here. I

need to see him.

RECEPTIONIST

If this is an emergency we have a

staff of psychiatric social workers.

There's about an hour's wait. I'll be

glad to take your name. Why don't you

just fill out this form?

JACOB

Goddamn it! I don't want a social

worker. Carlson knows me.

RECEPTIONIST

Hey! You can't go in there!

POLICEMAN

LET GO! GET AWAY!

LEADER

Can I help you?

JACOB

I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't

this his office?

LEADER

I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't

... Dr. Carlson died.

JACOB

(stunned)

Died?

LEADER

A car accident.

JACOB

Jesus, Jesus! ... When?

LEADER

Last month, before Thanksgiving.

JACOB

How did it happen?

LEADER

No one knows. They say it blew up.

JACOB

(growing pale)

Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?

LEADER

Do you want me to get someone?

JACOB

No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.

POLICEMAN

HEY YOU! MAILMAN!

POLICEMAN

Hold it. Just hold it. Where the hell

do you think you are? This is

Bellevue, for God's sake. People

running around here get shot.

LEADER

It's alright. He's okay.

POLICEMAN

(nodding, reholstering

his gun)

Come on, get out of here. I wouldn't

want to interfere with the U.S. Mail.

ELSA

Hey, you! Let me look at your hand!

DELLA

Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a

book.

JACOB

No, thanks.

DELLA

It's fun.

ELSA

You have an unusual hand.

JACOB

I could have told you that.

ELSA

You see this line here? It's your

life line. Here's where you were

born. And this is where you got

married. You're a married man, huh?

Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.

ELSA

(continuing)

You know, you got a strange line

here.

JACOB

(examining it)

It's short, huh?

ELSA

Short? It's ended.

JACOB

(laughing)

Oh, terrific.

ELSA

It's not funny. According to this ...

you're already dead.

JACOB

(smiling)

Just my luck.

CUT TO:

DANCERS

Come on man, show your stuff.

MAN

Come on professor. You got feet, too.

WOMAN

Hold me, baby!

JACOB

Shit!

VOICE

He's burning up.

VOICE

Total delirium.

VOICE

That's some gash. His guts keep

spilling out.

VOICE

Push 'em back.

JACOB (V.O.)

Help me!

ADMIRER

You are out of your mind, man. Out of

your fuckin' mind.

WOMAN

Jake, you little devil. You never

told me you could dance like that.

MAN

Jezzie, what did you put in his

drink?

JEZZIE

You okay?

JACOB

I wanna leave. Get me out of here.

JEZZIE

Oh, come on. It's early.

JACOB

(pulling JEZZIE close to

him, his voice filled

with paranoia)

Where are we?

JEZZIE

(surprised by the

question)

We're at Della's.

JACOB

Where?

JEZZIE

What do you mean? Where do you think?

JACOB

Where's Della? Bring her here?

JEZZIE

Why? What for?

JACOB

Show me Della!

JEZZIE

(confused)

Hey, I'm here.

DELLA

Hiya Jake. That was some dance.

JACOB

(staring at her closely)

Della?

DELLA

(feeling the

strangeness)

You want to see me? Well, here I am.

JACOB

I see.

DELLA

What do you want?

JACOB

Just to see you. That's all.

DELLA

(a bit uncomfortable)

Well, how do I look?

JACOB

Like Della.

JEZZIE

Are you feeling all right? Shit,

you're burning up. Feel his forehead.

DELLA

(checking his forehead

and cheeks)

Damn, that's hot. Maybe from dancing.

JEZZIE

I think you should lie down.

JEZZIE

(continuing)

Can't you stop it?

JACOB

If I could stop it, I'd stop it.

WOMAN

Is he sick?

DELLA

He's on fire.

ELSA

Let me help you.

JACOB

Stay away from me! Don't you come

near me! All of you. Go to hell! Go

to hell, goddamn you! Stay away!

MAN

I'll call a cab.

JEZZIE

I've never been so mortified in my

whole life. Never! Screaming like

that. I don't understand what's

gotten into you, Jake, to make you do

a thing like that. You're not acting

normal. I've lived with too many

crazies in my life. I don't want it

anymore. I can't handle it. I'm tired

of men flipping out on me. Shit,

you'd think it was my fault. Well you

picked me, remember that. I don't

need this.

JEZZIE

(continuing)

All right! All right!

JEZZIE

(continuing)

If you go crazy on me you're goin'

crazy by yourself. You understand?

JACOB

What's it say? A hundred and two?

JEZZIE

I don't believe this. I'm calling the

doctor.

JACOB

What does it say?

JEZZIE (V.O.)

It's gone to the top.

JACOB

How high is that?

JEZZIE (V.O.)

The numbers stop at 107.

JACOB

What the hell are you doin'?

JEZZIE

Get your clothes off.

JACOB

What are you talking about? I'm

freezing.

JEZZIE

Get your clothes off!

JACOB

What'd the doctor say?

JEZZIE (V.O.)

That you'd die on the way to the

hospital. Now get into that tub.

JEZZIE (V.O.)

He's coming right over.

JACOB

Coming here?

JEZZIE (V.O.)

Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't

stand around waiting.

JACOB

You're out of your mind. I'm not

getting in there. I'd rather die.

JEZZIE

That's your decision.

JACOB

Look at me. I'm ice cold.

JEZZIE

You're red hot, damn it. Get in

there. I've got to get more ice.

JACOB

Oh Jesus!

JACOB

I can't do it.

JEZZIE

What kind of man are you?

JACOB

Don't gimme that.

JEZZIE

Lie down!

JACOB

(pleading)

Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!

JEZZIE

(calling out)

Sam, Tony, come in here.

JACOB

Hey, I'm not dressed.

SAM

You got nothin' we ain't seen before.

JACOB

Get the hell off me.

TONY

He's like a hot coal.

SAM

It's for your own good, Jake.

JACOB

Let go of me, you sons of bitches.

JACOB

(continuing)

I'm freezing! I'm freezing! Goddamn

you!

TONY

(his hand turning red)

Sam, I can't take it.

SAM

Don't you let go.

TONY

Jez, get help. My hands are killing

me.

JACOB

Help me! Help me!

JEZZIE

(to TONY)

Here. I'll do it.

TONY

Take his legs.

SAM

Run your hands under hot water.

MRS. CARMICHAEL

I have some ice from the machine.

JEZZIE

Bring it in.

MRS. CARMICHAEL

Is he all right?

JEZZIE

He doesn't like it.

MRS. CARMICHAEL

I don't blame him. What should I do

with the ice?

JEZZIE

Pour it in.

MRS. CARMICHAEL

On top of him?

JEZZIE

He's melting it as fast as we dump it

in.

MRS. CARMICHAEL

Okay. My husband's got two more bags.

He's coming. They're heavy.

JACOB

Oh God! You're killing me! Stop!

JACOB

Damn! You and your fresh air.

SARAH

What was that?

JACOB

It's freezing.

SARAH

I'm not cold.

JACOB

Of course not. You have all the

blankets. It must be ten degrees in

here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you

want to sleep with fresh air, you

sleep on the fire escape. From now on

that window is closed.

SARAH

It's not healthy with it closed.

JACOB

This is healthy? I'll probably die of

pneumonia tomorrow and this is

healthy.

JACOB

(continuing)

What a dream I was having. I was

living with another woman ... You

know who it was?

SARAH

I don't want to know.

JACOB

Jezebel, from the post office. You

remember, you met her that time at

the Christmas party. I was living

with her. God, it was a nightmare.

There were all these demons and I was

on fire. Only I was burning from ice.

SARAH

Guilty thoughts. See what happens

when you cheat on me, even in your

mind?

JACOB

She was good in bed, though.

SARAH

Go to sleep.

JACOB

She had these real beefy thighs.

Delicious.

SARAH

I thought you said it was a

nightmare?

GABE

Daddy, what was that noise?

JACOB

(surprised to see him)

Gabe?

(he stares curiously at

his son)

What are you doing ... ?

GABE

There was a bang.

JACOB

It was the window.

GABE

It's cold.

JACOB

Tell your mother.

GABE

Mom, it's ...

SARAH

I heard you. Go back to sleep.

GABE

Will you tuck me in?

SARAH

(not happily)

Oh ... all right.

JED

Dad?

JACOB

Jed. It's the middle of the night.

(he kisses GABE and goes

over to JED in the lower

bunk)

What's up?

JED

You forgot my allowance.

JACOB

Your allowance? It's five A.M. We'll

talk at breakfast.

JED

Okay, but don't forget.

ELI

I love you, Dad.

JACOB

What is this, a convention? I love

you, too, Pickles. Now go back to

sleep.

GABE

Wait ... Daddy.

JACOB

Now what?

GABE

Don't go.

JACOB

Don't go?

(he smiles)

I'm not going anywhere. I'm right

here, Gabe.

(he looks at his son

tenderly)

Come on, go back to sleep. You can

still get a couple of hours.

GABE

... I love you.

GABE

(continuing)

Don't shut the door.

GABE

(continuing)

A bit more ... a bit more.

JACOB

I love you, Sarah.

VOICE

They're here.

VOICE

Thank God. Move 'em out!

VOICES

Bust your balls!

VOICE

Move it! Move it!

DOCTOR

You are a lucky man, my friend. A

lucky man. You must have friends in

high places, that's all I can say.

CUT TO BLACK:

JEZZIE

Jake.

(she places her hand on

his head and strokes his

hair)

You're gonna be all right, Jake.

You're gonna be fine.

JACOB

Am I home?

JEZZIE

You're here. Home. The doctor said

you're lucky your brains didn't boil.

(she smiles)

What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You

kept sayin' "Sarah, close the

window," over and over. And talkin'

to your kids. Even the dead one.

Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds

of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?

JACOB

Are we in Brooklyn?

JEZZIE

You're right here, Jake. You just

rest.

(she puffs up his

pillow)

The doctor said you had a virus.

That's what they say when they don't

know what it is. You can't do

anything for a week. He says you

gotta recuperate.

(she strokes his

forehead, and gets up)

Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman

made you some chicken soup. It'll

warm you up.

JEZZIE

You know, you really ought to get out

today. You can't just sit around like

this all the time. It's not healthy.

It's not good for your mind. Go take

a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie.

Christ, who's gonna know? You think I

care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy

yourself. One of us should be having

a good time.

(JEZZIE knocks on

JACOB's head)

Hello! Anybody home?

(she looks in his ear)

Anybody in there?

JACOB

What?

JEZZIE

Goddamn it! I can't stand it anymore.

I've had it up to here. Go ahead and

rot if you want ... You son-of-a-

bitch, I'm talking to you.

JEZZIE

(continuing, her anger

in check)

I made you a tuna fish sandwich. It's

in the fridge. Eat a carrot with it.

The aspirin's on the bottom shelf.

We're out of soap so, if for some

reason you decide to wash yourself

again, use the dishwashing stuff.

(she walks out of the

room and returns with

her coat)

I'm sorry I yelled, but you get on my

nerves.

(she bends down and

makes eye contact with

JACOB)

Hello? Listen, I gotta go.

JEZZIE

(continuing)

Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.

(she kisses his cheek)

Love me a little?

JACOB

(speaking with

affection)

You are the most unbelievable woman I

have ever met. One second you're a

screaming banshee and the next you're

Florence Nightingale. Who are you?

That's what I want to know. Will the

real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.

JEZZIE

Oh shit. Tell 'em I've left.

JACOB

Hello.

PAUL (V.O.)

Jacob Singer?

JACOB

Speaking.

PAUL (V.O.)

Paul Gruneger!

JACOB

Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be

goddamned!

JACOB

(continuing)

Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the

hell are you? I haven't seen you in

what, five, six, years?

PAUL (V.O.)

A long time.

JACOB

Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's

happening in your life?

PAUL (V.O.)

Nothin' much.

JACOB

Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So

tell me, to what do I owe the honor?

PAUL (V.O.)

I need to see you, Jake.

JACOB

Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But

I'm kind of laid up here. I've been

sick.

PAUL (V.O.)

I need to see you.

JACOB

Jesus, man, you look terrific. You

must have put on twenty pounds.

PAUL

I work in a bakery.

JACOB

You're lucky. How many vets you know

are even employed?

PAUL

Count 'em on one hand.

JACOB

It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?

PAUL

No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn

war. I'm still fightin' it.

JACOB

It's not worth it. You'll never win.

PAUL

You tellin' me? How many times can

you die, huh?

PAUL

(continuing)

Still married, Jake?

JACOB

Nope.

PAUL

You and everybody else. God I hate

this area. Makes me nervous.

JACOB

Why the hell we drivin' here?

PAUL

I just need to talk.

JACOB

You can't talk in Brownsville?

PAUL

I'm not sure where I can talk

anymore.

JACOB

What's wrong?

PAUL

Let's get a couple drinks, okay?

(he looks at his rear

view mirror)

Hey, take a look behind us. Do you

think that car is followin' us?

JACOB

(turning to look)

That black car?

PAUL

Pull the mirror down on the sun

visor.

(JACOB does)

Just watch 'em.

JACOB

What's goin' on Paul?

PAUL

I don't know.

JACOB

You in trouble?

PAUL

Yeah.

PAUL

Somethin's wrong, Jake. I don't know

what it is but I can't talk to

anybody about it. I figured I could

with you. You always used to listen,

you know?

PAUL

(continuing)

I'm going to Hell!

PAUL

(continuing)

That's as straight as I can put it.

And don't tell me that I'm crazy

'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to

Hell. They're comin' after me.

JACOB

(frightened, but holding

back)

Who is?

PAUL

They've been followin' me. They're

comin' outta the walls. I don't trust

anyone. I'm not even sure I trust

you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm

gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.

PAUL

(continuing)

Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just

gonna jump outta my skin. They're

just drivin' me wild.

JACOB

Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?

PAUL

I don't know who they are, or what

they are. But they're gonna get me

and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I

can't do anything. I can't go to my

sisters. I can't even go home.

JACOB

Why not?

PAUL

They're waitin' for me, that's why.

PAUL

(continuing)

I can't stop it. I try. Oh God! Help

me Jake.

JACOB

It's okay, Paul. It's okay.

PAUL

(crying)

I don't know what to do.

JACOB

Don't do anything.

(PAUL begins to relax a

bit and the shaking

subsides)

Paul, I know what you're talking

about.

PAUL

What do you mean?

JACOB

I've seen them too ... the demons!

PAUL

(staring at JACOB)

You've seen them?

JACOB

Everywhere, like a plague.

PAUL

God almighty. I thought I was the

only one.

JACOB

Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I

was coming apart at the seams.

PAUL

Oh God. I know. I know.

JACOB

What is it Paul? What's happening to

me?

PAUL

They keep telling me I'm already

dead, that they're gonna tear me

apart, piece by piece, and throw me

into the fire.

(he fumbles in his coat

pocket and pulls out a

small Bible and silver

cross)

I carry these everywhere but they

don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone

thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a

report with the army.

JACOB

(stunned)

The army?

PAUL

She said I haven't been the same

since then. Since that night. There's

still this big hole in my brain. It's

so dark in there, Jake. And these

creatures. It's like they're crawling

out of my brain. What happened that

night? Why won't they tell us?

JACOB

I don't know. I don't know.

PAUL

They're monsters, Jake. We're both

seein' 'em. There's gotta be a

connection. Something.

PAUL

I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I

keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come

up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a

guy can't even take a leak by

himself. I've seen 'em take people

right off the street. I used to go

home a different way every night. Now

I can't even go home.

JACOB

You come home with me.

PAUL

What about your girlfriend? You don't

think she'll mind?

JACOB

Are you kidding? We've put up more of

her cousins. You wouldn't believe how

they breed down there.

PAUL

Merry Christmas.

JACOB

Goddamn, this is my lucky day.

JACOB

Help me!

MEDIC

We're doing the best we can.

JACOB

Get me out of here!

YOUNG MAN

Just hold on.

JACOB

Where am I? Who are you?

YOUNG MAN

Just lie still. You're okay. You're

not hurt.

FRANK

Did anyone see the police report? It

sounds like a detonation job to me.

JERRY

The paper said it was electrical; a

freak accident.

ROD

Bullshit. Someone's covering

somethin'. That was no accident.

GEORGE

Why do you say that?

ROD

Cars don't explode that way. Any

simpleton knows that.

GEORGE

But the paper ...

ROD

That was set. I'm tellin' you.

DOUG

By who? Why? Paul didn't have an

enemy in the world.

JERRY

How do you know?

DOUG

Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd

want to hurt him?

FRANK

What did he talk about when you guys

went out? Did he say anything?

JACOB

He was upset. He thought people were

following him.

JERRY

You're kidding. Who?

JACOB

He didn't know ... Demons.

GEORGE

(obviously struck by the

word)

What do you mean, demons?

JACOB

He told me he was going to Hell.

ROD

What'd he say that for? What made him

say that? Strange, huh? Strange.

GEORGE

What else did he say, Jake?

JACOB

He was scared. He saw these creatures

coming out of the woodwork. They were

tryin' to get him, he said.

GEORGE

(his arm shaking)

How long had that been going on?

JACOB

A couple of weeks, I think.

GEORGE

He say what they looked like?

JACOB

No. Not really ...

GEORGE

Excuse me a minute. I'll be right

back.

ROD

In one end, out the other, huh

George?

ROD

(continuing)

Still a spastic, huh? I hope you can

hold your dick better than you hold

that can.

DOUG

I know what Paul was talking about. I

don't know how to say this ... but in

a way it's a relief knowing that

someone else saw them, too.

ROD

You're seeing ... ?

DOUG

They're not human, I'll tell you

that. A car tried to run over me the

other day. It was aiming straight for

me. I saw their faces. They weren't

from Brooklyn.

ROD

What are you tellin' me? They're from

the Bronx?

DOUG

It was no joke, Rod.

JERRY

Something weird is going on here.

What is it about us? Even in Nam it

was always weird. Are we all crazy or

something?

DOUG

Yeah, ever since that ...

ROD

What's that have to do with anything?

FRANK

It was bad grass. That's all it was.

JERRY

Grass never did that to me.

DOUG

You know, I've been to three shrinks

and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates

that night. Nothing.

ROD

It's not worth goin' over again and

again. Whatever happened, happened.

It's over.

JACOB

... I've seen them, too.

ROD

Shit!

JERRY

So have I.

JACOB

Look, there's something fucking

strange going on here. You know

Paul's not the only one who's died.

You remember Dr. Carlson over at

Bellevue? His car blew up, too.

ROD

Dr. Carlson's dead?

JACOB

An explosion, just like Paul's.

JERRY

No!

FRANK

Jesus!

GEORGE

You think they're connected?

JACOB

(he nods)

I think something's fucking connect-

ed. I mean, a car tried to run me

over the other day. Doug too, right?

We've got six guys here going fucking

crazy.

ROD

Not me, buddy.

JACOB

Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us

are flipping out for some goddamn

reason. They're tryin' to kill us.

Fuck it man, we need to find out

what's going on.

DOUG

Do you think it has something to do

with ... the offensive?

JACOB

It's got something to do with some-

thing. I think we've got to confront

the army. If they're hiding shit from

us, we better find out what it is.

ROD

Come on, Professor. The army's not

gonna give you any answers. You'll be

buttin' your head against a stone

wall.

JACOB

Maybe that's the only way to get

through. Besides, six heads'll be

better than one.

ROD

Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm

gettin' a headache just listenin' to

you.

JACOB

We should get ourselves a lawyer.

ROD

I say you should get a shrink.

DOUG

Too late. I've tried. I think you're

right, Jake. I'm game.

JERRY

Me, too.

ROD

You guys are fucking paranoid. It was

bad grass. That's all it was. There's

no such thing as demons.

GEARY

I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you

have any idea how many people come to

me with the injustices of the world?

It'd break your heart.

JACOB

This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The

army did something to us and we've

got to find out what.

GEARY

The army. The army. What is it with

you guys? We're not talking about a

trip to the library here. This is the

United States Government for God's

sake. This is red tape coming out of

your ass. You know what I mean?

JACOB

Exactly. And we need someone to cut

through it. We hear you're the man.

GEARY

Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason

here?

GEARY

(continuing)

Okay. I'll look into it.

PAUL

Wow! Do you think we have a chance?

GEARY

What do you want, a fortune teller or

a lawyer? ... I'll need sworn

depositions from each of you and a

list of the other members of the

platoon, or their survivors.

DOUG

Hey, this is great.

GEARY

I'll tell you, if we find the

military is implicated in any way,

you could stand to recover quite a

lot of money. Not that I can predict

anything, but some class action suits

of this kind have been awarded fairly

generous judgements. That wouldn't be

so bad, would it Mr. Singer?

JACOB

Doctor.

(GEARY looks at him

oddly)

Ph.D.

GEARY

Ah! I thought you were a mailman.

JACOB

I am.

GEARY

(confused)

Then why aren't you teaching? Why

aren't you in a university?

JACOB

I'm too messed up to teach.

GEARY

(smiling)

Ah! Well then, they're going to have

to pay for that, aren't they?

JEZZIE

So tell me ... am I still an angel?

JACOB

(smiling broadly)

With wings. You transport me, you

know that? You carry me away.

JEZZIE

We're all angels, you know ...

(she bites his earlobe.

He winces)

... and devils. It's just what you

choose to see.

JACOB

I love you, Jez.

JEZZIE

I know.

JACOB

Underneath all the bullshit, just

love.

JEZZIE

Remember that.

JACOB

You know what? I feel ... exorcised

... like the demons are gone.

JEZZIE

How come? The army?

JACOB

In a way. At least now I have some

idea of what was happening. If we can

only get them to admit ... to explain

what they did ... I don't know. Maybe

it'd clear things up in my head. I'll

tell you something, Jez, honestly

... I thought they were real.

JEZZIE

I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a

Manhandler. It'll be ready at a

quarter of. I threw a little salad

together. It's in the fridge. I also

bought some apple juice, Red Cheek.

Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake,

your lawyer called.

JACOB

He did? When?

JEZZIE

(grabbing her coat)

While you were in the shower.

JACOB

Why didn't you call me?

JEZZIE

He didn't give me a chance.

(she pauses nervously)

Look, honey, don't get upset, but

he's not taking your case.

JACOB

(stunned)

What? What do you mean?

JEZZIE

He said you didn't have one.

JACOB

What's he talking about?

JEZZIE

I don't know. That's all he said. He

wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He

said your buddies backed down. They

chickened out, he said.

JACOB

I don't believe this.

JEZZIE

Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd

stay and talk but I'm so late. Look,

don't be upset. We'll talk when I get

home. See you around midnight.

(she kisses him on the

cheek)

Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or

something.

FRANK (V.O.)

Hello.

JACOB

Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.

JACOB

(continuing)

Listen, I just got a strange call

from Geary. He said the guys backed

down. What's he talking about?

FRANK

(fingering the Venetian

blinds)

That's right. We did.

JACOB

What does that mean, Frank? I don't

get it. Why?

FRANK

It's hard to explain.

JACOB

(angry)

Well, try, huh.

FRANK

I don't know if I can. It's just that

war is war. Things happen.

JACOB

Things happen? What the fuck are you

talking about? They did something to

us, Frank. We have to expose this.

FRANK

There's nothing to expose.

JACOB

Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to

you?

(silence)

What's going on? How can you just

turn away?

(no response)

What about the others?

FRANK

They're not interested, Jake.

JACOB

Shit! You know it's not half the case

if I go it alone. We're all suffering

the same symptoms, Frank. The army is

to blame. They've done something to

us. How can you not want to know?

FRANK

(pausing)

Maybe it's not the army, Jake.

JACOB

What do you mean?

FRANK

Maybe there's a larger truth.

JACOB

What are you talking about?

FRANK

Maybe the demons are real.

JACOB

Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is

that?

FRANK

Listen, Jake. I gotta go.

JACOB

What the hell? What kind of mumbo

jumbo ... ?

FRANK

I'm hanging up.

JACOB

Hey, wait!

FRANK

Don't bother to call again, okay?

JACOB

Shit!

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

JACOB

NO!!!

JACOB

Geary! Mr. Geary! Listen, goddamn it!

You can't just walk away from this.

JACOB

(continuing)

Who's been talking to you? The army?

Have they been talking to you, huh?

GEARY

Nobody's been talking to nobody. You

don't have a case, you hear me? It's

pure and simple. Now leave me alone.

Okay?

GEARY

(continuing)

Take your hands off me!

JACOB

Listen, will you listen? They're

trying to get me. They're comin' out

of the walls. The army's done

something to me. I need you.

GEARY

You need ... a doctor.

JACOB

A doctor? And what's he gonna do,

tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked

with my head. I've got to prove it.

You've got to do something.

GEARY

There's nothing I can do.

GEARY

You mind? I'm eating, huh?

JACOB

Something's going on here. You're not

telling me something. What the hell's

gotten into you?

GEARY

I'll tell you what's gotten into me.

I don't know you from Adam, right?

You come to my office with this

bizarro story and demand I look into

it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and

I did. Now I don't know what kind of

fool you take me for, but you have

used and abused me, and I don't like

it.

JACOB

Used you?

GEARY

I talked to the Army's Bureau of

Records. You've never even been to

Viet Nam.

JACOB

What the hell is that supposed to

mean?

GEARY

It means that you and your buddies

are whacko, that you were discharged

on psychological grounds after some

war games in Thailand.

JACOB

(stunned)

War games? Thailand? That's not true!

How can you believe that? Can't you

see what they're doing? It's all a

lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's

sake. You've got to believe me.

GEARY

I don't have to do any such thing.

I'm eating my lunch, okay?

JACOB

You slimy bastard! You goddamn piece

of shit!

GEARY

He's on his way.

SOLDIER 1

Let's go, Singer.

SOLDIER 2

You're coming with us.

ARMY OFFICIAL #1

Mr. Singer. What an appropriate name

for a man who can't keep his mouth

shut.

JACOB

Who are you? What do you want?

ARMY OFFICIAL #2

We've been watching you for a long

time. You and your friends. You've

been exhibiting some very odd

behavior. Frightening people with

foolish talk about demons - and

experiments.

ARMY OFFICIAL #1

You're in over your head, Mr. Singer.

Men drown that way. The army was

another part of your life. Forget it.

It is dead and buried. Let it lie.

ARMY OFFICIAL #2

I hope we have made our point, Mr.

Singer.

SANTA

Merry Christmas.

BEARER

He's been screaming like a madman.

You better get something in him.

RESIDENT

(approaching JACOB)

Hi. I'm Doctor Stewart. Can you tell

me what happened?

JACOB

My back. I can't move. I need my

chiropractor.

RESIDENT

Your back? Did you fall?

BEARER

They said he slipped on the ice. May

have hit his head.

ATTENDANT

Does he have any identification?

BEARER

No waller. Nothing.

JACOB

They stole it.

RESIDENT

Who did?

JACOB

I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my

son's picture in it. Gabe's picture.

It's the only one I had.

RESIDENT

We better get an orthopedic man in

here. Is Dr. Davis on call?

NURSE

I'll page him.

JACOB

Call my chiropractor.

NURSE

We're doing everything we can.

JACOB

Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.

RESIDENT

I'm going to have to move you a bit,

just to check for injuries. This may

hurt a little.

JACOB

No. Don't move me.

RESIDENT

I don't have to ask if you can feel

that.

JACOB

Goddamn it. I want Louis.

NURSE

Who's Louis?

RESIDENT

He's out of it. I'm taking him down

to X-ray.

JACOB

Where are you taking me? Where am I?

ORDERLY

You know where you are.

JACOB

Oh God!

JACOB

JEZZIE!

JACOB

(continuing)

Get me out of here.

"DOCTOR"

Where do you want to go?

JACOB

Take me home.

"DOCTOR"

Home?

(they all laugh)

This is your home. You're dead.

JACOB

Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm

not dead.

"DOCTOR"

What are you then?

JACOB

I'm alive.

"DOCTOR"

Then what are you doing here?

JACOB

I don't know. I don't know.

(he struggles like an

animal)

This isn't happening.

"DOCTOR"

What isn't happening?

JACOB

Let me out of here!

"DOCTOR"

There is no out of here. You've been

killed. Don't you remember?

"DOCTOR"

Remember?

JACOB

No! That was years ago! I've lived

years since then.

"DOCTOR"

It's all been a dream.

JACOB

No! The army did this to me! They've

done something to my brain.

(he raves like a madman)

Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm

not dead! I want my family!

NURSE

He's still pretty doped up. I don't

think he'll be able to talk yet and I

doubt that he'll recognize you.

SARAH

I just want to see him.

JED

(eating a Snickers bar)

Dad. Hi. It's us. We just found out.

ELI

You look terrible. Does that hurt?

NURSE

I'll be outside if you need me.

SARAH

Jake. It's me. We heard what

happened.

JACOB

(his voice hoarse,

nearly whispering)

I'm not dead. I am not dead.

SARAH

No. Of course you're not. You've just

hurt your back. That's all. You're

going to be fine. It'll just take

some time.

JED

A month, they said.

ELI

(trying to joke)

You just hang in there, Dad.

SARAH

(smacking him)

That's not funny.

(she reaches over and

rubs JACOB's brow)

What a mess, huh? God I wish there

was something I could do. I love you,

Jacob. For whatever that's worth. I

do.

"DOCTOR" (O.S.)

Dream on!

JACOB

(yelling at the unseen

voice)

No! Oh God.

SARAH

Jacob, what can I do?

JACOB

Save me!

NURSE

Well, don't we look better this

morning? That was a hard night,

wasn't it?

JACOB

Where am I?

NURSE

Lennox Hospital.

JACOB

I'm awake?

NURSE

You look awake to me. Here.

(she holds the straw to

his lips)

Drink some of this.

JACOB

(staring at her

intently)

Where's Sarah? Where did she go?

(the NURSE gives him a

strange look)

She was here ...

NURSE

No. No. You haven't had any visitors.

JACOB

That's a lie. My family was here.

NURSE

I'm sorry.

JACOB

Last night! They were as real as you

are!

JACOB

This is not a dream! This is my life.

NURSE

Of course it is. What else could it

be?

LOUIS

Jacob! Jacob Singer!

JACOB

Louis! I'm here! In here!

JACOB

LOUIS!

NURSE 1

You can't go in there!

ORDERLY

You're going to have to leave.

LOUIS

Good God, Jake. What have they done?

(he examines JACOB and

screams at the NURSES)

What is this, the Middle Ages? And

they call this modern medicine. This

is barbaric! Barbaric!

(turning to JACOB)

It's okay, Jake. It's not serious.

I'll get you out of here.

(yelling at the ORDERLY)

What is this, the Inquisition? Why

don't you just burn him at the stake

and put him out of his misery?

ORDERLY

What the hell do you think ... ?

LOUIS

Don't you come near me.

NURSE 2

You can't do that!

LOUIS

What is this, a prison? Stay back.

NURSE 1

You can't. Call the police.

LOUIS

(to the ORDERLIES)

You take one step and I'll wrap this

around your neck.

LOUIS

(continuing)

Hold on, Jake, we're getting out of

here.

LOUIS

Half an hour from now and you'll be

walking out of here all by yourself.

Mark my words.

(JACOB barely hears

them)

Well, you've done it to yourself this

time, haven't you?

JACOB

(nearly whispering)

Am I dead, Louis?

(LOUIS leans over to

hear)

Am I dead?

LOUIS

(smiling)

From a slipped disc? That'd be a

first.

JACOB

I was in Hell. I've been there. It's

horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.

LOUIS

Well, I'll see what I can do about

it.

JACOB

I've seen it. It's all pain.

LOUIS

(working on JACOB's

spine like a master

mechanic)

You ever read Meister Eckart?

(JACOB shakes his head

"no")

How did you ever get your Doctorate

without reading Eckart?

(LOUIS takes hold of

JACOB's legs and yanks

them swiftly)

Good. Okay, let's turn over gently.

Right side.

LOUIS

The other "right," okay?

(he helps JACOB turn

over)

You're a regular basket case, you

know that?

(he moves JACOB's arm

over his head)

Eckart saw Hell, too.

LOUIS

(continuing)

You know what he said? The only thing

that burns in Hell is the part of you

that won't let go of your life; your

memories, your attachments. They burn

'em all away. But they're not punish-

ing you, he said. They're freeing

your soul. Okay, other side.

LOUIS

(continuing)

Wonderful. So the way he sees it, if

you're frightened of dying and hold-

ing on, you'll see devils tearing

your life away. But if you've made

your peace then the devils are really

angels freeing you from the earth.

It's just a matter of how you look at

it, that's all. So don't worry, okay?

Relax. Wiggle your toes.

LOUIS

(continuing)

Perfect. We got it.

(LOUIS pushes a lever

and the table rises back

up)

Okay. Let's just give it a little

try. See if you can stand.

JACOB

What? By myself?

LOUIS

You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just

give it a try.

LOUIS

Hallelujah.

LOUIS

What are you doing?

JACOB

There's something I've gotta take

care of, Louis.

LOUIS

What are you talking about? You can

barely stand.

JACOB

I'm walking, aren't I?

LOUIS

Jake, you need to rest.

JACOB

Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.

JACOB

I love you, Louis.

JACOB

Listen to me. There were four

companies in our batallion. Five

hundred men. Seven of us were left

when it was over. Seven! Four

companies engaged in an enemy

offensive that not one of us who

survived can remember fighting.

BYSTANDERS

Use the torch!

ONLOOKER

Shut up! Let him talk!

JACOB

(shouting)

You don't forget a battle where 500

men were killed. They did something

to us. I want to know the truth, the

goddamn truth. We have a right to

know.

(he yells toward the

cameras)

Are you getting all this? I want this

on national T.V. I want the whole

country, the whole world to know.

VOICE

Throw that torch away, young man.

Give yourself up. You're under

arrest.

JACOB

For what? For seeking the truth?

VOICE

Please come quietly.

JACOB

You come near me and I'll blow us all

up.

VOICE

We're not going to hurt you.

ONLOOKER

Give him a chance to talk!

JACOB

The army will deny it. They've

falsified my records. They've lied to

my lawyer, threatened my buddies. But

they can't threaten me.

BYSTANDER

You tell 'em!

BYSTANDER

Use the torch!

VOICE

Okay, let's clear the area. Everyone

out.

JACOB

What the fuck do you think you're

doing?

VOICE

Clear the area. This is an order!

JACOB

What is wrong with you?

JACOB

NO!

ONLOOKER

He'll burn us all!

JACOB

Who's there? Who is it?

JACOB

(continuing)

Goddamn it! Who's there?

JEZZIE

It's just me.

JACOB

Jezzie?

JEZZIE

Who else were you expecting?

JACOB

Let go!

JEZZIE

Where were you, Jake? Where've you

been? Why haven't you called?

JACOB

Stay away from me, Jez.

JEZZIE

I want to know. You tell me!

JACOB

You wanna know? Turn on the T.V.

Watch the fucking news!

JEZZIE

Why are you doing this to me? You

can't just go away like that.

JACOB

I can do anything I want.

JACOB

Don't!

JEZZIE

It might be for me.

JACOB

I'm not here. You haven't seen me.

JEZZIE

(picking up the

receiver)

Hello ... No. He's not here. I

haven't seen him all night ... I

don't know when ... What? Tell him

what?

(JACOB looks up)

Vietnam? ... What experiments?

JACOB

Hello. This is Jacob Singer.

(he listens with growing

fascination)

God almighty! ... Yes. Yes. Right.

Where would you like to meet?

(he listens)

How will I know you.

(JACOB seems

uncomfortable)

Okay. I'll be there.

JEZZIE

Who was that?

JACOB

A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare

unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me

and that I'll know him when I see him.

JEZZIE

How?

JACOB

I have no idea.

(he thinks)

I was right. There were experiments.

I knew it. I knew it. My God.

JEZZIE

How do you know he's telling the

truth?

NEWSCASTER

Leading the news tonight, a bizarre

demonstration on the steps of the

U.S. Army Recruiting Headquarters, in

downtown Manhattan. Jacob Singer, an

alleged Vietnam vet ...

JACOB

Alleged? Alleged?

NEWSCASTER

... challenged the United States Army

to admit conducting secret experi-

ments involving hundreds of American

soldiers during the Vietnam war.

JEZZIE

(almost threatening)

Don't leave me, Jake.

MICHAEL

Jacob? Hi. I'm Michael Newman.

Friends call me Mike.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know

me. I've been tracking you for a long

time. I just wish I'd spoken to you

before tonight.

JACOB

I don't get it. Who are you? Why have

you been following me?

MICHAEL

Observation, mainly. Clinical study.

You were one of the survivors.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

Come on, we're not safe around here.

MICHAEL

So first I'm arrested, right? Best

LSD I ever made, right down the

drain. I figure this is it, twenty

years in the joint, if I'm lucky.

That was '68.

JACOB

Long time ago.

MICHAEL

(nodding his head)

Next thing I know I'm on Rikers

Island. Ever been there?

(JACOB shakes his head)

Suddenly they take me from my cell to

the visitors room with those bank

teller windows, you know. Four army

colonels, medals up their asses, are

standing on the other side. They tell

me if I'll come to Vietnam for two

years, no action, mind you, just work

in a lab, they'll drop all the

charges and wipe the record clean.

Well, I'd only been in jail for

thirteen hours and I already knew

that Nam couldn't be any worse.

JACOB

Shows how much you knew.

MICHAEL

No shit. They had me by the balls.

Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ...

in a secret lab synthesizing mind-

altering drugs. Not the street stuff

mind you. They had us isolating

special properties. The dark side,

you know? They wanted a drug that

increased aggressive tendencies.

JACOB

Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.

MICHAEL

Right. They were worried. They

figured you guys were too soft. They

wanted something to stir you up, tap

into your anger, you know? And we did

it. The most powerful thing I ever

saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my

share, never compared to the fury of

the Ladder.

JACOB

The Ladder?

MICHAEL

That's what they called it. A fast

trip right down the ladder.

(he makes a downward

dive with his hand)

Right to the primal fear, the base

anger. I'm tellin' you, it was

powerful stuff. But I don't need to

tell you. You know.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

We did experiments on jungle monkeys.

They bashed each other's heads in,

gouged out their eyes, chewed off

their tails. The brass loved it. Then

they made us try it on Charlie.

(he pauses)

They took these POW's, just kids

really, and put 'em in a courtyard.

We fed 'em huge doses of the stuff.

(he stops for a moment;

a tear rolls down his

cheek)

They were worse than the monkeys. I

never knew men could do such things.

The whole thing still blows me away.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

Anyway, this big offensive was coming

up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine,

Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was

scared 'cause they knew we couldn't

win. Morale was down. It was gettin'

ugly in the States. Hell, you

remember.

JACOB

Like it was yesterday.

MICHAEL

A couple days later they decided to

use the Ladder, on one test

battalion. Yours. Just in an

infintessimal dose in the food

supply, to prove its effectiveness in

the field. They were sure your unit

would have the highest kill ratio in

the whole goddamn offensive. And you

did, too. But not the way they

tnought.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

Hey, want something to calm you down?

Made 'em myself.

JACOB

None of us can remember that night. I

get flashes of it but they don't make

sense. We saw shrinks for years. But

nothing they did could ever touch it.

What happened? Was there ever an

offensive?

MICHAEL

A couple of days later. It was

fierce. You guys never saw it.

JACOB

But there was an attack. I can still

see them coming. There was a fight,

wasn't there?

MICHAEL

Yeah. But not with the Cong.

JACOB

Who then?

MICHAEL

You killed each other.

ROD

Oh my God! WHAT'S HAPPENING?

MICHAEL

It was brother against brother. No

discrimination. You tore each other

to pieces. I knew it would happen. I

warned them. I WARNED THEM. But I was

just a hippie chemist, right? Jesus!

And I helped 'em make the stuff ... I

talked to the guys who bagged the

bodies. They're in worse shape than

you, believe me. They saw what was

left. It's a blessing you don't

remember. Of course the brass covered

the whole thing up right away. Blamed

it all on a surprise attack.

he pauses)

I needed to find you. The Ladder was

my baby.

MICHAEL

I always suspected the effects might

come back. That's why I had to follow

you. I had a hell of a time getting

hold of your records.

JACOB

If you knew, why didn't you say

anything?

MICHAEL

The truth can kill, my friend. Five

hundred men died out there. This

isn't a story they'd ever want out.

When Paul's car blew up I realized

the scope of the thing. I knew they

meant business.

JACOB

So why tell me now?

MICHAEL

Because I can get rid of the demons.

I can block the Ladder. I have an

antidote. We can kill them off,

chemically speaking. They'll all

disappear. It's chemistry, my friend.

I know. I created it. Come with me. I

can help.

JACOB

You come here often?

MICHAEL

Sometimes. When it's convenient.

JACOB

How do I know this isn't just some

kind of, you know, seduction or

something?

MICHAEL

Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got

bigger problems than me.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

I came up with the formula back in

Nam but I never got a chance to use

it.

JACOB

Never?

MICHAEL

I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just

open your mouth and stick out your

tongue.

JACOB

What is it?

MICHAEL

Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your

head. Come on.

JACOB

(fearful)

I don't know.

MICHAEL

"Yea though I walk through the valley

of the shadow of death I shall fear

no evil," but no one ever said I

wouldn't be shittin' in my pants

every step of the way, huh?

(JACOB smiles, his mouth

open)

Stick out your tongue.

(JACOB obeys as an

eyedropper deposits a

drop of liquid on the

back of his tongue)

That'a boy. Now why don't you just

lie down and relax.

JACOB

One drop?

MICHAEL

It's strong stuff.

JACOB

I think I'm falling asleep.

MICHAEL

Pleasant dreams.

JACOB

I can't move.

MICHAEL

Just relax.

JACOB

What's happening? Help me.

JACOB

(continuing)

HELP ME!

MICHAEL

Take it!

MICHAEL

(continuing)

Don't fight it. It's your own mind.

It's your own fears.

MICHAEL

So, how you doin'?

MICHAEL

(continuing)

It was better than you expected, huh?

MICHAEL

(continuing)

And no more demons. I told you they'd

be gone.

JACOB

I don't believe this. It's a miracle,

Michael. A miracle.

MICHAEL

Better living through chemistry,

that's my motto.

JACOB

It was paradise, Michael. You showed

it to me. You were there.

MICHAEL

Well that's good to know.

JACOB

Mike, it was real. It was glorious.

MICHAEL

Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed

you enough of that stuff to send a

horse to heaven. I'm just glad you

came back.

JACOB

I would have stayed there if I could.

MICHAEL

I'm sure. You've got nothing but

troubles waitin' for you here.

MICHAEL

(taking JACOB's arm)

Come on.

MICHAEL

Here. I've got every credit card ever

printed. Take this. Stay here till

you can arrange to get away. It's on

me.

JACOB

No. I couldn't.

MICHAEL

What? You want the Plaza? Don't be

foolish. Here. Take this, too.

(he pulls out a business

card)

This is my place on Prince Street.

It's got my phone, everything. Call

if you need me ... but you won't.

Everything's gonna work out. You just

get outta town as fast as you can.

The New York police can be effective

when they want to be.

JACOB

I don't know what to say.

MICHAEL

Save the words ... Just send back my

credit card.

JEZZIE

What are you doing here? Are you all

right? How do you expect to pay for

this?

(JACOB smiles)

Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I

dodged people all over the place,

reporters, police. I don't know what

you're gonna do.

JACOB

I'm gonna make love to you. That's

what I'm gonna do.

JEZZIE

Are you out of your mind?

JACOB

Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.

JEZZIE

God, I can't keep up with all your

changes.

JACOB

Me neither.

JEZZIE

What's gotten into you?

TIME CUT:

JEZZIE

It's amazing, you know, that a drug

could change things like that,

destroy a life and then give it back.

It's hard to believe that the world

could be so hellish on day and like

heaven the next.

JACOB

I tell you, it was so wonderful. I

felt like a little boy. I saw

Paradise, Jezzie.

JEZZIE

It's so hard to believe.

JACOB

Who's there?

BELLBOY (V.O.)

It's your dinner, sir.

JEZZIE

This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever

since I was a little girl. I never

thought it would happen.

JACOB

Stick with me, kid.

TIME CUT:

JEZZIE

I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever

you go.

JACOB

It's not practical, Jez. It'll be

hard enough alone.

JEZZIE

I can waitress. I'm good.

JACOB

No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll

send for you.

JEZZIE

Bullshit!

JACOB

I promise.

JEZZIE

Please.

JACOB

No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the

only one left. I don't want to expose

you to that. It's not right for you

or me. Be reasonable.

JEZZIE

Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ...

You're gettin' me angry.

JACOB

I love you when you're angry.

JEZZIE

Oh yeah?

(her eyes twinkle

suggestively)

Try leavin' without me.

JACOB

Chicago. One way. For tomorrow.

SELLER

How many?

JACOB

One.

SELLER

That'll be $119.75.

JACOB

Goddamn it!

(he covers it with his

hand. A pencil jabs his

palm. He yells)

Fucking pervert.

VOICE

Dream on!

JACOB

(shocked)

What?!

MAN

You lookin' for Mike?

JACOB

(panting hard)

Where is he?

MAN

Don't know. Hasn't picked his mail up

in days. It's not like him.

MAN

What the hell are you doing?

MAN

Oh my God!

JACOB

(barely audible)

I'm going to Brooklyn.

DRIVER

Sorry, Mac. Not with me you're not. I

get lost in Brooklyn.

JACOB

I know the way.

JACOB

(continuing)

Look, this is all the money I've got

in the world. Take me home and it's

yours.

DRIVER

... Where's your home?

DOORMAN

Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.

JACOB

(greeting him warmly)

Hello, Sam.

DOORMAN

(noticing JACOB's

battered condition)

Are you all right?

JACOB

I'm okay.

DOORMAN

Do you want some help? I can call

upstairs.

JACOB

No, don't. But thanks.

JACOB

Hello. It's me.

JACOB

Hello? Is anybody home? Jed? Eli?

Daddy's here.

JACOB

Sarah, is that you? I hope you don't

mind. I needed to come home.

JEZZIE

Hello, Jake. I knew you'd come here

in the end.

JACOB

What're you ... ? Where's Sarah?

Where are the boys?

JEZZIE

Sit down, Jake.

JACOB

Where are they?

JEZZIE

Sit down.

JACOB

No! What's going on? Where's my

family?

JEZZIE

It's over, Jake. It's all over.

JACOB

Where have they gone?

JEZZIE

Wake up. Stop playing with yourself.

It's finished.

JACOB

What's going on?

JEZZIE

Your capacity for self-delusion is

remarkable, Dr. Singer.

JEZZIE

(continuing)

What's wrong, Jake?

(she mocks him)

Forget to take your antidote?

JACOB

Who are you? What are you doing to me?

JEZZIE

You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved

your friends. That chemist - the

Ladder. What an imagination you have!

JEZZIE

(continuing)

And your vision of paradise ...

fantastic! You're a real dreamer, you

know that? Only it's time to wake up.

JEZZIE

(continuing)

Your mind is crumbling, Jake. No more

"army." No more conspiracies. You're

dying, Dr. Singer. It's over.

JEZZIE

(continuing)

Where's to run, Jacob? Where's to go?

JACOB

WHO ARE YOU?

JEZZIE

How many times have you asked me

that? How many times?

JACOB

TELL ME, DAMN YOU!

JEZZIE

(with consummate power)

YOU KNOW WHO I AM.

JACOB

(whispering to himself)

This isn't happening.

LOUIS (V.O.)

If you're frightened of dying you'll

see devils tearing you apart. If

you've made your peace then they're

angels freeing you from the world.

CREATURE

WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FIGHTING!

CREATURE

WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE

FIGHTING?

CUT TO:

JACOB

Hello?

JACOB

(continuing)

Who is it? Who's there?

JACOB

(continuing)

Gabe? Gabe!

JACOB

(continuing)

Gabe. Oh God. I don't believe ...

GABE

Come on Dad ... You know what we've

got? A sandbox just like the

Williston's, only it's bigger and the

sand's all white. You won't believe

it.

GABE

(continuing)

And my parakeet. Remember, the one

grandma let out of the cage? He's

okay. And he's talking now. He knows

my name.

DOCTOR

He's gone.

THE END

STERN

Thus at the core of today's discu-

sion we find four fundamental doc-

trines. First, that the world of

matter and individual consciousness

are both manifestations of one Divine

Reality.

STERN

Even you, Mr. Palmer, are part of it,

as amazing as that may seem.

STERN

Second, human beings are capable not

only of kowledge about this Divine Re-

ality by inference but can realize

its existence by direct intuition,

superior even to reason.

STERN

Third, man possesses a double nature,

an ego and an eternal self, what we

call "spirit" or "soul."

STERN

Fourth, and most important, man's

life on earth has only one end and

purpose, to learn to let go of the

separate ego and to identify with the

Divine spark within.

STERN

Almost impossible to believe, isn't

it Mr. Palmer, that somewhere in that

unconscious head of yours lies the

source of all consciousness?

PALMER

Yes, Sir. Very hard.

STERN

(nodding his head)

Well now, having reached this

apotheosis there seems little, if

anything, left to say. So rather than

try, you are dismissed.

JACOB

Hello Prof.

STERN

My oh my. Doctor Singer. Isn't this a

happy surprise?

STERN

(looking at JACOB's uni-

form)

Are you in the service?

JACOB

The postal service. I'm a mailman.

STERN

(surprised but non-

judgemental)

Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark

of night ... I always admired that.

JACOB

(smiling)

It's good to see you.

STERN

Likewise.

STERN

And how is your wife? Sarah, no?

JACOB

(shrugging his shoul-

ders)

I haven't seen her in months.

STERN

(understanding)

Ah!

JACOB

I'm with another woman now. We're

both with the post office, Midtown,

34th Street branch.

STERN

Hmm. I don't suppose there are too

many philosophers in the post office?

JACOB

Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't

have their doctorates, that's all.

STERN

(he smiles)

Last I heard you were offered a posi-

tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon

was it?

JACOB

Oh, that goes way back. They had a

hiring freeze, one of those last min-

ute things. Bad timing for me though.

Middle of the war. The draft.

(STERN nods his head.

They walk a moment in

silence)

I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam

... I didn't want to think anymore. I

decided my brain was just too small

an organ to comprehend this chaos.

STERN

(looking at JACOB with

affection)

Jacob, if it was any other brain but

yours, I might agree.

(he pauses)

Tell me, does your lady friend know

what a brilliant thinker, what a sub-

lime intellect she's living with?

JACOB

(smiling coyly)

I doubt it's my mind that interests

her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery

lady.

STERN

(with a fatherly

demeanor)

Well, try not to get burned. You have

a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone

tempt you away from it.

JACOB

I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus-

tine than Kierkegaard, if you know

what I mean.

(STERN looks at him

questioningly)

I need to know about ... demons.

STERN

(surprised)

Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you

writing ... ?

JACOB

No.

(he pauses a moment)

I see them.

STERN

See them?

(he smiles uncomforta-

bly)

What do you mean? Physically?

JACOB

(hesitantly)

Yes.

STERN

I know very little about demons, Ja-

cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them

as literary figures, biblical ones

... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,

(he pauses)

this is the 20th Century. We don't

see demons now.

JACOB

I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're

invading my life.

JACOB

(continuing)

Christ, I know how it sounds.

STERN

Have you considered a doctor? A psy-

chiatrist?

JACOB

Yes.

(suddenly uneasy)

I don't want them. I'm not looking

for analysis or drugs. It's too easy

to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.

(he pauses uncomforta-

bly)

It's more than that. I can feel it. I

need you Prof. You're the only one I

can talk to.

STERN

I don't know what to say.

JACOB

I need your insight, your intuition.

STERN

Demons? I don't know what to tell

you. It sounds like a spiritual mat-

ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is

that you have no context for it.

You're a renegade Existentialist suf-

fering demons a hundred years after

Freud. How the hell am I supposed to

make it fit?

JACOB

I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes

sense.

(he pauses)

Please help me.

STERN

(trying to be delicate)

Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not

in the empirical sense. I don't be-

lieve in devils fighting for our

souls. I don't believe in enternal

damnation. I don't believe in other-

worldly creatures tormenting us. We

don't need them. We do a good enough

job on ourselves.

JACOB

(disturbed)

But I see them.

STERN

Look. I don't pretend to know what's

going on inside your head. For all I

know it's pathological and they

should be pumping Valium into your

veins by the quart. But if you're not

willing to accept the help of sci-

ence; and believe me, I admire you

for that: then you'll have to do bat-

tle on your own. What can I say? It's

a lonely pilgrimage through our times

even for the strongest souls. But to

be pursued by ... demons no less ...

There are no guides, Jacob.

(he muses)

You wanna know what I'd do if I sud-

denly started seeing demons? I'd hail

the first taxi that came along, shoot

over to Bellvue and beg them for

shock treatment. I'm no saint.

JACOB

Hell, you think I am?

STERN

I'venever understood you, you know

that? You were by far the best pupil

I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu-

ally, you were the most original, the

most imaginative. Who knows, maybe

you've been "elected" to see demons.

Maybe you're in touch with ... some-

thing. Nothing would surprise me

about you Jacob. Nothing.

VOICE

He's burning up.

VOICE

Total delirium.

VOICE

He'll never make it.

VOICE

That's some gash. His guts keep

spilling out.

VOICE

Push 'em back.

JACOB (V.O.)

(crying weakly)

Help me!

VOICE

I think we're losing him.

HAYES

The Reverend Norman Murphy, leader of

one of the largest groups supporting

the Armageddon Committee, told our

cameras that we are no longer dealing

in decades but years.

MURPHY

The battleground is being readied.

Our planet is the battlefield. Our

souls are the prize. All the signs

point to the inevitable confrontation

between the forces of good and evil.

People must choose sides. There is no

draft evasions in this war. All are

called. All must take up weapons. Are

you prepared? That's the question we

ask.

HAYES

Do you find people scoffing at you,

Reverend? After all, there have been

doomsayers for thousands of years and

we're still here.

MURPHY

People are less apt to laugh these

days. The prophecies are too close

for comfort. I mean, all you have to

do is watch the news.

HAYES

There are some who claim that your

pessimism is defeatist and what the

world needs now is hope, a positive

thrust.

MURPHY

I think the time for hope has passed.

The seeds have been planted. We shall

reap what we've sown.

(he pauses)

Pessimists, no. I think we are

percieved as the only realists

around.

HAYES

Other movement leaders agree. In an

interview ...

JEZZIE

So tell me ... am I still an angel?

JACOB

(smiling broadly)

With wings.

(he strokes her hair)

You transport me, you know that? You

carry me away.

JACOB

(yelling at the top of

his lungs)

NO!

JEZZIE

Jake, are you all ... ?

JEZZIE

Jake? Jake?

JEZZIE

It's going to be all right, Jake.

It's going to be all right. Don't be

afraid. I've got you now.

JACOB

Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.

JACOB

Oh God!

JACOB

Jezzie! Help me!

JEZZIE

You're completely off your rocker,

you know that? You'd think you fell

on your head instead of your back.

What are you planning to do, burn

down the apartment along with your

demons?

JACOB

(yelling)

Don't you touch it.

(he glares at her)

JACOB

Who are you?

JACOB

(continuing)

Who the hell are you?

JACOB

Why won't you answer me?

JEZZIE

(angry)

Cause you know goddamn well who I am.

JACOB

I don't know you.

JEZZIE

You've lived with me for two years.

JACOB

That doesn't mean shit. Where do you

come from, huh? And I don't mean

Indiana.

JEZZIE

What do you want me to say? My

mother's tummy?

JACOB

You know goddamn well what I mean.

JEZZIE

You're out of your fucking mind. I'm

not gonna stand around here gettin'

interrogated by you.

JACOB

Well leave then. Go to Hell.

JEZZIE

(furious)

You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think

you are? I don't deserve this. Who

takes care of you day and night? Who

cleans the floor and washes your

goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it.

You flip out on your own, you

ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding

your hand. I don't want anything to

do with you, you hear? Nothing!

JACOB

(continuing)

HELP ME!

MICHAEL

Take it!

WOMAN

It's been four days. No word. It's

not like him. He's never done any-

thing like this before. It's like he

just disappeared from the face of the

earth.

REPORTER

The Bureau of Missing Persons is con-

founded by the continuing surge of

reports ...

JEZZIE

What'd you do that for? It's an in-

teresting story. All these people are

still disappearing. Right off the

street.

(staring at JACOB)

Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?

JACOB

I'm okay. I just don't want to lis-

ten.

JEZZIE

You look upset.

JACOB

(angry)

I'm not upset.

JEZZIE

Jake, what is it?

JACOB

I'm tired.

JEZZIE

You look terrible. What happened?

(he turns away. She

stares at him for a mo-

ment, concerned)

Jake ... is it the antidote?

JACOB

Goddamn it. Why do you say that?

JEZZIE

Look at yourself. You look like

you've seen a ghost.

JACOB

Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?

JEZZIE

You can have anything you want.

JACOB

Then don't bug me.

JEZZIE

I'm not bugging you. Come and lie

down. I'll give you a massage.

(she taps the mattress

again and JACOB joins

her. She unbuttons his

shirt)

Where'd you go today?

JACOB

(evasively)

Mid-town mostly.

JEZZIE

Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?

JACOB

(looking away from her)

I picked up my ticket.

(he pauses)

I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.

JEZZIE

(tensing)

Oh?

(acting innocent)

Where you going?

JACOB

(nervously)

West.

JEZZIE

(growing angry)

Where's West? New Jersey?

JACOB

Don't be funny.

JEZZIE

I always liked the West, west of Il-

linois anyway. But you gotta give me

time to pack.

JACOB

Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.

JEZZIE

Do what? I haven't done a thing.

JACOB

Don't play games with me. There's

nothing more to say.

JEZZIE

Jake. What are you doing? Look, I'm

sorry, I didn't mean to bite. Let me

get you a towel.

JEZZIE

Jake, don't. You can't leave. You're

not seeing things clearly. The drug's

wearing off.

JEZZIE

Jake, don't leave me!

JACOB

(calling out)

Hello. It's me.

JACOB

Hello? Is anyone home? Jed? Elie? Dad-

dy's here.

JACOB

Sarah, is that you? I hope you don't

mind. I needed to come home.

JEZZIE

Hello, Jake. I knew you'd come here

in the end.

JACOB

Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?

JEZZIE

Sit down, Jake.

JACOB

Where are they?

JEZZIE

Sit down!

JACOB

No! What's going on? Where's my

family?

JEZZIE

It's over, Jake. It's all over.

JACOB

Where have they gone?

JEZZIE

Wake up! Stop playing with yourself.

It's finished.

JACOB

What's going on?

JACOB

(whispering to himself)

This isn't happening.

JEZZIE

Your capacity for self-delusion is

remarkable, Dr. Singer.

JACOB

Oh God!

JEZZIE

What's wrong, Jake?

(she mocks him)

Forget to take your antidote?

JACOB

(screaming)

Goddamn you!

JEZZIE

(smiling and then

laughing)

I loved your chemist, Jake. The

height of fantasy. And your vision of

paradise.

(she laughs with a hu-

miliating tone)

A most romantic creation. You're

quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time

to wake up.

JEZZIE

There is nowhere to run, Jacob.

You're home.

JACOB

WHO ARE YOU?

JEZZIE

How many times have you asked me

that? How many times?

JACOB

TELL ME, DAMN YOU!

JEZZIE

(with consummate power)

You know who I am.

DEMON

(with JEZZIE's voice)

Still love me, Jake?

(it laughs and reaches

out to him)

COME!

JACOB

NO!!!!!

ELI

Daddy!

JACOB

Oh God!

ELI

You're hurting me!

JACOB

(yelling)

Stop!!!!

ELI

Daddy. Let go.

JACOB

What do you want from me?

ELI

LET GO!

VOICE

Who the Hell do you think you're

fighting?

JACOB

Oh God, help me.

MICHAEL

I am with you, Jacob.

MICHAEL

(speaking with a gentle

compassion)

It's all right now. It's over. You've

won. You're here.

(JACOB stares at him

questioningly. MICHAEL

reaches out his hands)

Trust me.

MICHAEL

Come on. Don't make me do it all.

(his eyes sparkle)

Stand up.

(JACOB's eyes are burst-

ing with wonder)

You can do it.

MICHAEL

Stop hobbling. Your flesh can't hold

you anymore.

MICHAEL

Go on, Jacob. It has come for you.

DOCTOR

He's gone.
