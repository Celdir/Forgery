OVER BLACK:

MAX'S VOICE

C

I don't believe in heaven, but I have

this idea about it. Something I heard in

a song.

White.

pristine, empty frame.   Clean and peaceful.

MAX'S VOICE

Heaven is a place where nothing ever

happens.

MAX'S VOICE

There's an army of bodies under this

river. Criminals, people who ran out of

time, out of friends.

MAX'S VOICE

The next time they drag this river,

they'll find me on the bottom with the

rest of them. And there won't be anybody

left to say I was different.

CUT TO:

MAX'S VOICE

I could feel the dead down there, just

below my feet. Reaching up to welcome me

as one of their own.

MAX'S VOICE

It was an easy mistake to make.

CUT TO:

MAN #1

Hey, that's a really nice watch.

MAN #1

(drooling over the watch)

Kinda reminds me of one I lost--

MAX

You didn't lose it. You pawned it up on

128th a few hours ago.

MAX

(nodding to Man #2)

Ask Doug. He was there with you.

DOUG

You've been following us all night?

MAX

No.

(pointing)

I'm only following you.

PAWNSHOP

You a cop, or something?

MAX

Not tonight.

PAWNSHOP

Too bad.

(to Doug)

Go get my watch.

DOUG

(craving, eyes closed)

Watch over me, watch over me...

MAX

Open your eyes, now.

MAX

Have you ever seen her before?

MAX

You got busted robbing a house in New

Jersey with William Preston three--

DOUG

Bill's dead.

MAX

That's why I'm talking to you.

(moving the photo closer)

Did he ever say anything about this

woman? Did you ever hear anyone--

DOUG

Bill died because their wings couldn't

lift him up.

MAX

No, he got shot robbing a liquor store.

What are you talking about?

DOUG

(incoherent, rambling)

Their wings are golden, the feathers only

look black...

NT. COLD CASE OFFICE - DAY

SGT. ADAMS

You my new guy?

DETECTIVE

I didn't think anybody was here.

SGT. ADAMS

Everybody's usually a little late.

SGT. ADAMS

All the cold investigations in the city

are collected and delivered over to us.

We call each witness to see if they can

add anything to their original statement.

DETECTIVE

And if they can?

SGT. ADAMS

We send the file back to the original

precinct for follow-up. Don't get your

hopes up, though.

SGT. ADAMS

Once you've gone through the file and

come up empty, bring it here...

7.

SGT. ADAMS

Max here handles our filing. Once it

hits his desk, a case is officially dead.

ax looks up, dark circles from his long night in the subway.

D

ETECTIVE

What if there's no phone number for a

witness? Should I follow up in person?

SGT. ADAMS

Nope, we don't do that down here.

iscretely, Max slides his cut-up knuckles under the desk...

DETECTIVE

I don't understand, then how--

SGT. ADAMS

How do you solve that unsolvable murder

mystery and redeem yourself?

DETECTIVE

The grand jury couldn't find--

SGT. ADAMS

Stop. Trust me, there's a tragic story

behind why I'm here giving you this tour.

We all did something, so just save it.

(moving for the door)

Follow me to the break room...

DETECTIVE

We should get a beer after work, or

something...

MAX

Yeah.   Maybe so.

DETECTIVE

So what did he do?

J

8.

SGT. ADAMS

(sharply)

Nothing.

SGT. ADAMS

R

emember when you were a kid, and you'd

hold your breath when you went past a

graveyard?

SGT. ADAMS

ust...try to leave him alone.

ax goes to a rusted cabinet and buries the file deep inside.

uddenly, colors burst into the monochrome room: bright

OICE (O.S.)

You can't come here anymore.

MAX

William Preston was a dead end.

TREVOR

You can't come here, I said. I'm done

helping you. I've already...

(lowering his voice)

...paid my debt to society, you know?

I've cooperated enough.

MAX

We need to talk.   Won't take long.

T

M

10.

TREVOR

I thought you found Bill's partner.

MAX

I did, but Doug only wanted to talk about

pigeons, or something. I need a new

name, someone robbing houses to feed a

habit around that same time.

T

REVOR

Three years is a lifetime for guys like

that. One way or the other, they're

probably all gone now.

(a little self-satisfied)

Either way, I'm not the one to ask

anymore. I cater to a better class, now.

MAX

I can see that.

TREVOR

This is a party. These are my friends.

You remember friends?

AX

I need another name, or I start frisking

your friends.

TREVOR

don't have one to give you, Max. Look,

you've gone through all your living

leads, now you're running out of dead

ones...

(beat)

I don't think this guy's out there.

TREVOR

ry sleeping at night every now and then,

you'd see that for yourself.

TREVOR

I'd invite you in, but...

That's interesting.

NATASHA

Thank you. It's...

Shit.

ithout preamble, Mona begins YELLING at Natasha in Russian.

MAX

Why don't you let go--

MONA

(in perfect English)

Mind your business.

t happens in a flash: Mona spins and takes hold of Max's

NATASHA

Sort of a bitch.

You have to go. Now.

hree years ago. So we're somewhere,

now: who was that guy--

N

ATASHA

(frustrated sigh)

Fine. What was her name?

MAX

Who?

NATASHA

The girl from the boring story you want

tell me. The one that ends with you

living here. Very sad.

NATASHA

tell you what...

(beat, evil smile)

Call me by her name.

MAX

(startled)

What?

NATASHA

That way you can make love to her again,

just like she never left you.

(shrill, mocking voice)

Oh, Max, I miss you...

Y

M

15.

AX

You should go.

NATASHA

Excuse me?

MAX

(exhausted, to himself)

There's nothing you can tell me.

N

ATASHA

ou're kicking me out of your bed?

MAX

Yeah.

NATASHA

What do we know?

DETECTIVE #1

Only that it didn't happen here. Beyond

that, I don't even know how to describe

it in my report. `Disassembled,' that's

the word we came up with.

MAX

Why are you showing me this?

ALEX

We found it here, by her heart.

ALEX

As far as we know, the victim--

MAX

They couldn't lift him up...

We need to talk, Max. Tonight.

For God's sake, I know where you--

The E.R. doctor's old man was a patrolman

in the 45th. I got him to get you a

private room.

BB

our contact information was... pretty

out of date, you know, but one of the

dispatchers remembered me and your dad

riding together back in the day.

MAX

Alex.

BB

he first unit to respond must've scared

them away before they could do the same

thing to you. Pretty remarkable,

considering your luck.

MAX

He was trying to tell me something.

B

Was he alive when you showed up?   Did you

get a look at the guys who--

MAX

No.   I get Bflashes, but it's...wrong.

B

I hate to say it, but you need to come up

with something better than that. They've

got nothing for leads, so the whole force

has you pegged as the prime suspect.

AX

You tell them where to find me.

BB

No need.   The funeral starts in an hour.

BB

ust slow down.   You need to--

AX

What I need is to borrow some dress

blues. Can you help me out?

It's a bullet hole.

Yeah, from a musket ball. The British

She stole it.

So you didn't know she was a prostitute?

MAX

No, I didn't.    We met through a friend.

BRAVURA

Trevor Duncan. He's your friend?

MAX

I guess.

BRAVURA

That's classy. You know what Trevor does

for a living, I assume?

MAX

He used to snitch for me.

ell me, Max, what's a glorified file

clerk still need a snitch for?

He wanted me to help him with something.

And?

MAX

That's what I'm going to do.

ravura gives Max a hard look.      Mad, but genuinely searching.

BRAVURA

ook at this from my perspective: I've

got two bodies in ten body bags. You

were the last person to see either one...

AX

(pointing to the photos)

And some of that blood is mine.     Good

luck with your case.

BB

Nice work, detective.

BRAVURA

You've been around long enough to know

I'm his only way out.

BB

Well, I hope that felt good.

BB

It makes you look guilty. You understand

that, right? Now it's not just Alex's

unit that thinks you're the guy...

ALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

You need friends on the force right now.

There's only so much I can do outside...

Where are you going?

So stupid...

MONA

You left your wallet lying beside her

body. Who's stupid?

MAX

Does that sound like something a Homicide

cop would get wrong?

MAX

You know somebody named Owen?

MONA

Owen Green?

MAX

Natasha called him on her way out of my

apartment. Give me one day to--

ONA

No.   Now.

Who is this guy?

Somebody my sister used to hang around

with. Nice kid.

You're sure this is the place?

Something I can help you with?

MAX

What if I wanted this tattoo?

TATTOO ARTIST

Then you're probably in the Marine Corps.

MAX

(pointing to the wings)

This one.

MONA

What is it?

37.

TATTOO ARTIST

(intimidated)

It's a Norse superstition. The Vikings

used to wear them for protection.

MONA

Trust me, my sister had all the guardian

angels she needed.

TATTOO ARTIST

Not angels. Valkyries.

TATTOO ARTIST

In Norse mythology, the only way you get

to go to heaven is to die in violence.

Die in your sleep, you go to hell.

Valkyries fly over the battlefields,

picking out the righteous dead. They

reward the people who draw first blood.

A soldier's angel.

TATTOO ARTIST

I'm generally thrilled to have referral

business, but I tell people looking for

those wings to find ink closer to home.

MONA

Where's home?

TATTOO ARTIST

Some club down in Alphabet City.

Protection from what?

They see you...they see you...

MONA

Do you know this guy?

MONA

(without conviction)

Maybe it isn't anything new.   People get

strung out, act crazy...

MAX

You think they were both on something?

39.

MONA

Crystal meth, maybe, some amphetamine

that raises your body temperature in an

overdose. Explains why they were both

sweating like that, trying to cool off.

(beat)

Of course, a junky won't usually jump out

the window if there's someone left in the

room to beg or rob.

ax nods his agreement, replaying Owen's death in his mind.

MAX

You were standing right beside me.

MONA

And?

MAX

Jumped is not the word I'd use.

B stoops down to find Max's eyes, trying for a connection.

BB

There's nothing you can't say in here.

It's like hallowed ground.

MAX

I watched a guy throw himself out of a

window tonight. The things he was saying-

BB

Any guy who throws himself out a window,

I wouldn't pay any attention to the

things he said.

MAX

The problem is, I knew what he was

talking about.

MAX

I haven't been really afraid of anything

since...that night.

BB

And you are now?

MAX

There's something going on, and I can't

find a rational explanation for it.

B

43.

MAX(CONT'D)

There's...something out there, hurting

people--

BB

Okay, calm down.

MAX

It's real.     I'm not crazy.

BB

Then stop acting like it. Max, you're

breaking into offices, I.A. is all over

you, you won't even show up for work...

MAX

The night Alex died, there was something

else in the room with us. I saw it.

B

B goes a bit pale, smile fading as Max's words continue.

B

It's really important that you be careful

how you talk to people about this, okay?

You're already under suspicion--

MAX

It's the same thing these people are

seeing right before they die.

(beat, pained)

I think Michelle saw it, too.

BB

For God's sake, don't drag her into this.

What's really going on here?

Alex found something out about what

happened to her. Something new.

There's no way.    He would have told us.

Listen, okay? Why don't you come back

Talk.

Shut the door, then. You Ruskies may be

used to it, but I'm freezing my dick off

over here.

Okay.     So talk.

Something was taken from me. It involves

Oh. Well, blessing might cost extra.

Which club are we talking about?

MONA

Ragna Rok.

MONA (CONT'D)

Over on Avenue--

VINNIE

Yeah, I know.

Sure, fine. You have my

permission...blessing, whatever.

MONA

You do still control that block, right?

It's south of--

VINNIE

The guy's name is Jack Lupino.

MONA

Well, that sounds Italian to me.

VINNIE

He's no kind of Italian I've ever seen.

Tattooed freak, a real sicko from what we

hear.

ONA

(sneering)

You're afraid of tattoos, now?

VINNIE

When the club first opened, I sent

somebody down to collect the...you know,

fire insurance. A day goes by, and I

don't see him. Then I get two boxes

delivered to me. One box's got my guy's

hands and ears in it. The other box has

a quarter of a million dollars in cash.

47.

MONA

This neighborhood has been your family's

forever. Two-fifty large is all it takes

to--

VINNIE

What got my attention, Mona, was that the

boxes were delivered by a cop car. A guy

in uniform hands them to me in broad

daylight.

(beat)

I'm not scared of tattoos, or freaks, or

mouthy Russian bitches. But whoever's

watching over Lupino, whoever it is you

really need to bless you walking inside

Ragna Rok...him, I am scared of.

Look, I called you because I thought I

recognized something in you. I thought

if we could talk off the record--

BRAVURA

I'm listening.

BB

(emotional)

This isn't just some job stress freak-

out. This is a man who lost everything,

and who deserves a little understanding

from the rest of us. If you'd known him

before...

(beat, pained)

You'd want to believe him, too.

BRAVURA

Believe him about what?

BRAVURA

Are you saying you think Max did have

something to do with Alex's murder?

BB

Absolutely not. Alex was his partner,

they were like brothers...he couldn't

have. There's no way.

BRAVURA

Then what are we talking about?

BB

Look, Max is like a son to me. Don't put

me in a position to have to hang him.

(beat, pained)

But you should hear the kinds of things

he's saying...hallucinations, none of it

makes any sense to me. I'm worried he's

going to get into another situation

before I can convince him to come in.

Is there anything we can do to help you

bring him in? Unofficially, of course...

BRAVURA

Bringing him in won't be a problem.

Where I need your help will be his--

B

Why do you say that?

RAVURA

A New Jersey unit ID'd him near his old

house. It shouldn't be long.

B nods, somberly mulling this over.

You have to find him first, protect him.

Jason Colvin. He used to be the head of

There's no Project Valhalla anymore.   I

It was a disaster. The drug was so

addictive, the damage it did to the mind

was so devastating that we lost our

government funding. By the end, we

couldn't even guarantee the safety of our
