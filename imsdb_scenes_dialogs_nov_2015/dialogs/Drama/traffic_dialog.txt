Traffic by Stephen Gaghan

"TRAFFIC"

By

Stephen Gaghan

Based on the miniseries "Traffik"

By

Simon Moore

MR. RODMAN

This informant, paid by the police,

using taxpayers dollars to continue

his felony drug habit, was the link

which allowed police to raid a private

farm.  A working farm.  A farm where

honest Americans make their living.

MR. RODMAN

The government, in its haste, has

employed an army of criminals whose

allegiance to the truth is, at

best, questionable --

ROBERT

Mr. Rodman...it's too bad your client

didn't show as much sense in choosing

what he planted as he did in choosing

his attorney...

ROBERT

Lately the only variation I'm hearing

in your argument is the name of the

client.  And you can sit there all

day arguing the ins and outs of

Illinois v. Gates, but you aren't

going to convince me that this country

has not sanctioned the use of

anonymous informants.

(beat)

Furthermore, there is no sacred

protection of property rights in the

United Sates.  When you make the

decision to have marijuana on your

farm, whether it's one joint or an

acre of plants, your property can be

seized and your property can be sold.

MR. RODMAN

I'm sorry the court finds my argument

repetitious.

ROBERT

Mr. Rodman, may I offer a piece of

advice?  The next time you argue

this point before this court,

regardless of my whereabouts, I

recommend you have something up your

sleeve other than your arm.

CLERK

What do you think it is?

ROBERT

Depends who it's from.

CLERK

(reading the card)

Your friends at Warren, Putnam and

Hudson.

ROBERT

You can learn a lot about somebody

from this stuff.  Three categories:

you like me, you hate me, you want

something from me.

(re: the elaborate

box)

Definitely third category.

CLERK

What would a law firm want from the

new drug Czar?

ROBERT

Depends on the state.

CLERK

(checks)

Arizona.

ROBERT

Medicinal marijuana initiative.

(beat)

Or am I being cynical?

CLERK

Maybe there's a book in it.

ROBERT

Not by me.

WE MATCH CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JAVIER

I had that dream again.

MANOLO

Which one?

JAVIER

Where my mother's suffocating.

DRIVER

Is there a problem?

JAVIER

No.  There's no problem.

DRIVER

Okay.  I see.  How much do you want?

DRIVER

You want more than this?

DRIVER

You want something else?

JAVIER

Drop the package.  Put your hands

behind your head.  You're under

arrest.

DRIVER

I don't understand.  I think there

must be some mistake.

JAVIER

No, there's no mistake.

SALAZAR

(to Javier)

What's your name?

JAVIER

Javier Rodriguez.

SALAZAR

Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done

a very good job, but we'll take care

of it from here.

SALAZAR

We've been following these Narco-

trafficantes for some time but had

not been able to bring them to

justice.

(to his men)

Put the prisoners in the car.

Impound the truck.

SALAZAR

(to Javi)

One question.  How did you find about

this?

JAVIER

An informant.

SALAZAR

What is the name of your informant?

JAVIER

(beat)

It was an anonymous tip.

SALAZAR

(to his men)

For a State Police officer, you're

very well informed.  Let's go.

MOMENTS LATER

Javi and Manolo watch the convoy of

vehicles drive away.

MANOLO

Wasn't that General Salazar?

JAVIER

Yeah.

MANOLO

What's he doing up here?

JAVIER

I don't know.  Something.

CASTRO

No telltales.  Nothing to read.

Not touching my face.  Not even

blinking.  No giveaways.

(beat)

How're you feeling?

GORDON

(keyed up)

I feel good.

CASTRO

No more pissant basin league bullshit

for us, hunh?

GORDON

Nope.

CASTRO

Limbering up, gonna stay loose, keep

it all together.  Take this

motherfucker down.

CASTRO

Showtime.

CASTRO

(in Spanish)

Good afternoon, ladies, gentlemen.

We're looking for Eduardo Ruiz.  We

have a two o'clock appointment.

RUIZ

You ever buy a quarter ton?  Not

many people have.

RUIZ

So, it's worth the wait, right?

What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have

an airlift?  It's not like you can

put it in a condom up some mule's

asshole, right?  How many peasants

would that take?  A line stretching

from here to Mexico City --

GORDON

Nobody said shit, Eduardo --

RUIZ

Relax.  We're waiting, that's it.

CASTRO

Hey, you want to hear a joke?  I got

a joke.  Why do women wear makeup

and perfume?

GORDON

Chill out --

CASTRO

It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's

quick.  Why do women wear makeup and

perfume?

RUIZ

I don't know.

CASTRO

'Cause they're ugly and they stink.

GORDON

Man, you never been close enough to

a woman to know how she smells.

DEA AGENT (V.O.)

What's his hand doing?  Watch his

hand.  Anybody?  I don't like the

hand.

DEA AGENT

This is ridiculous this fucking thing.

(taps monitor)

Look at this shit -- the first

television transmission.  I had better

shit when I was the AV guy at junior

high, swear-to-God.

ANOTHER DEA AGENT

Come on, Castro, pay attention.

Watch his damn hands.

RUIZ (ON MONITOR)

Soon.

FBI AGENT #2

All right, here we go.  The blue

van.

FBI AGENT #2

Three unmarked vehicles.

(picks up walkie)

Three unmarked vehicles accompanying.

FBI AGENT #2

It's local.  Local or Customs.  Oh,

man, I don't know.  Looks like the

cavalry.

FBI AGENT

This is our show.  Ah, man.  I don't

want to share this one.

CASTRO

Agent down.  Repeat, agent down.

CLOWN

Hey dudes, we're not open yet.

RUIZ

Take me to the hospital.  I'm bleeding

to death.

CUT TO:

SETH

Father of Greek tragedy?  Anyone?

Okay, Aeschylus it is.

(hits keys)

His trilogy?  The Oresteia.  I mean

this is beautiful, can anyone stop

the Seth Machine?

(hits keys)

Score.  Thank you.  Madmax from Omaha

we own you.  And Tragedy is closed

out.

CAROLINE

Entertainment.  The Susan Lucci

section or Banal Love Songs of the

Nineties?

SETH

Banal Love Songs it is.

(hits keys)

Hey, you wanna try something?

CAROLINE

What are you doing?

SETH

(concentrating)

Just watch.

SETH

Inhale the smoke and hold it.

CAROLINE

What is this, like freebase?

SETH

Not like.  It is.

SETH

Go...  Go!

SETH

Hold it.

SETH

See... Now, you see.

CAROLINE

More.

CUT TO:

CHIEF OF STAFF

Until you officially take over the

office of National Drug Control

Policy, under no circumstances should

you speak to the press unprotected,

without going through this office or

having someone in the room.  There

are a lot of interests in this town

and, right now, they're all scared

of you.  The reason they're scared

of you...technically, you have veto

power over their budgets.  So think

about that: FBI, CIA, DEA, CUSTOMS,

TREASURY, ATF, DEFENSE, IRS, Radio

Shack and the DMV, they're all gonna

want to speak to you.  And that's

the good news... You'll also be

meeting Senators and Congressman,

each with a specially prepared

question.  Their question is designed

for one thing: to make them look

smart.  If you lecture them, they

won't think you respect them.  If

you respond with utter humility,

they will.  Remember, this is about

your respect for them, and the

President's respect for them.

Speaking of which, as soon as he

gets back from Russia and China,

we'll get you in there for some face-

time, let the two of you catch up.

(beat)

It'd probably be a good idea for you

to meet your predecessor.  I'll have

Jeff Sheridan take you over.

Also, four weeks from today you will

give your first official press

conference.  In it you will outline

the President's strategy for winning

the war on drugs.

(beat)

Okay, anything else?

ROBERT

I'll be sure to let you know.

SHERIDAN

I just want to be clear about one

thing.  I used to work for him, but

now I work for you.  I'm not a

partisan person, I'm an issue person.

In the next few weeks, if you allow

me, we'll get you well-versed on an

incredible array of issues.  The

most important of which, in my

opinion, being Mexico.  I know

everybody that you're gonna meet.

It's important that they like you.

It's not important that they like

me.  That's why I can help protect

you.

ROBERT

Like you protected Landry?

SHERIDAN

I see where you're going with that,

but if I could just say something,

which is basically that a guy like

Landry is so autocratic he doesn't

know how to let himself be helped;

it's a point of pride to take every

bullet, no matter who fired it, or

whether it was even aimed at him,

which personally I think it very

self-defeating.  Now, don't get me

wrong, he's a man of enormous

integrity, but there's a political

component to this job that the General

just didn't have any patience for.

GENERAL LANDRY

Jeff, you want to excuse us for a

minute?

GENERAL LANDRY

(bemused, off

Sheridan's exit)

Functionaries.  Nice people, the

Schedule C's.  About twelve graduate

degrees apiece, but it seems sometimes

all they do is start rumors.

ROBERT

You've done a fine job here, Sir.

The Office of National Drug Control

Policy is in better shape than when

you found it.

GENERAL LANDRY

I'm not sure I made the slightest

difference.

(wistful)

I tried...  I really did.

ROBERT

There are a lot of encouraging

statistics.  The work's just started,

but I intend to see it through.

You've got my word on that.

GENERAL LANDRY

You're here for two years, three

maximum.  What'd they promise you?

Court appointment?  What?  District?

Appeals?

(checks Robert's

reaction)

Not Supreme... Supreme?

ROBERT

I've come in to do a tough job and

that's what I'm going to focus on.

GENERAL LANDRY

When Kruschev was forced out, he sat

down and wrote two letters and handed

them to his successor.  He said "When

you get into a situation you can't

get out of, open the first letter

and you'll be saved.  And when you

get into another situation you can't

get out of, open the second."  Soon

enough this guy found himself in a

tight place.  So he opened the first

letter.  It said, "Blame everything

on me."  So he blamed the old guy

and it worked like a charm.

(beat)

He got into another situation he

couldn't get out of, so he opened

the second letter, which read, "Sit

down and write two letters."

CUT TO:

JAVIER

Relax.  If they were going to kill

us they would have done it in the

desert.

MANOLO

They wouldn't do it in front of all

these people.  They'd send someone

later, when we're alone.

MANOLO

(yelling out the window)

Away from the car.  Now!

JAVIER

Even if that were true, they're not

going to come to your house where

you're waiting for them.

ANNA

He's right.  They'll do it when you're

walking somewhere, make it look like

street crime.

MANOLO

Shut your fucking mouth.  Nobody's

talking to you.

JAVIER

If you want her to stay out of it,

then stop telling her everything.

You should learn how to keep a secret.

MANOLO

She's nosy.  She hears me on the

telephone.

JAVIER

Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see

them again.  Everything's back to

normal.

TOURIST WOMAN

You're a police officer.  Aren't you

going to take a report or something?

Don't you want to know what kind of

car it is?

TOURIST MAN

It's a Brown Ford Explorer --

TOURIST WOMAN

It was right here.  It's been stolen.

I want to file a report.

MANOLO

Please.  Filing a report will not

help you find your car.

JAVIER

The police won't find your car.

TOURIST WOMAN

But you're the police.

JAVIER

Call this man, he'll find your car

for you.

TOURIST MAN

I don't get it --

TOURIST WOMAN

How will this guy know who has our

car?

JAVIER

The police will tell him.

TOURIST MAN

Why will they tell him but they won't

tell us?

TOURIST WOMAN

(getting it)

Because we pay him, stupid.

(to Javier)

Right?  And he pays the police.

JAVIER

Yes.  Better than filling out forms,

right?

OFFICER (O.S.)

Javier Rodriguez.

CUT TO:

NAN

Duck salad?

HELENA

Mmm.

NAN

Helena, you never order duck salad.

HELENA

Well, that's true.  I don't.

(re: her belly)

I think someone else is asking for

it.

NAN

Well, he's got good taste.  Isn't it

the most wonderful thing you ever

tasted?  I mean ever.

HELENA

It's delicious --

STEWIE

They're the most marvelous little

creatures.  Canard.  They fly, swim,

walk.  And so cute with their babies

marching along behind.

NAN

Looking for a nice sauce ala orange.

ALEX

It's a very fatty bird.  All that

winter insulation.  Just like me.

NAN

You mean all breast, just like you.

ALEX

You're bad --

NAN

(singsong)

Jealous, that's all --

HELENA

I've heard... I can't remember

where... That it's full of that good

kind of fat, the kind you're

supposed to eat --

STEWIE

Unsaturated fat --

TWO WOMEN IN UNISON

Polyunsaturated.

HELENA

And now there's a good cholesterol

and bad cholesterol.  Everything

they tell you completely changes

every other week.  I don't know why

they think we should listen at all.

NAN

What I know is ducks, as cute as

they are, were designed by God to be

eaten.

HELENA

I'll put this in the back.

DAVID

No --

HELENA

All the professionals keep them in

the trunk.

DAVID

Not Tiger Woods.

HELENA

Especially Tiger Woods.

(sharing a secret)

...Actually, he keeps his on the

back seat.

LONNIE

Gates, Myrhvold, Bezos.  I sell to

all those guys.  Why?  Because the

technology to intrude has reached

the masses.  Your competitor, your

ex-spouse, adversaries, stalkers,

they're at the local electronics

store right now, and they're gonna

be intruding on you not only through

your telephone, but your fax, cell

phone, pager, cable TV, Musak,

windows, walls, air conditioning

ventilation, modem, and internet

connection.

LONNIE

Nobody has these babies, no way, not

the shiznit.

FRANCISCO

I want to intercept cell phone calls,

digital and analog.  And locate the

source of the call.  I need databasing

capability, to cross-reference calls

and numbers.

LONNIE

Your Cellular Secretary, friend across

all the digital wireless spread

spectrum.

(beat)

So, Francisco, what do you do?  You

a PI?  Private security?

FRANCISCO

Assassin.

LONNIE

(not missing a beat)

Assassin, okay.  Let's get you started

in surveillance.

PHARMACEUTICAL LOBBYIST

We in the legal drug business, and I

mean Merck, Pfizer, the rest of my

very powerful clients, realize this

isn't a war with a traditional winner

and loser, but an organism at war

with itself, whose weapons of mass

destruction happen to be intoxicants.

And if you want a body count look no

further than alcohol which racks up

80,000 kills a year.  Cocaine manages

a measly 2,000.  Same for Heroin.

But, the big daddy is Big Tobacco

which kills 380,000 each year, which,

by the way, is more people than have

been killed by all the illegal drugs

in the last century.

ROBERT

(faking it)

That's very interesting.

STAN

It's time, Robert, to choke some

honesty out of these rural

legislators; get'em to fess up that

it's pretty much Prisons or Casinos

in terms of their choices for economic

growth.

ETHAN

What's the difference between Prozac

and Ecstacy, you ask?  One's a

mattress and the other's a trampoline.

Molecules don't have morality.

Really, think about it: some molecule

changes the way a serotonin re-uptake

inhibitor works, it's not suddenly a

bad molecule; it's just a molecule.

My theory: America has a real fear

of short, intense experiences.

ROBERT

(under his breath)

Like you.

ANOTHER ROOM

Robert at the bar getting another

scotch.  A secretive man, TIM, 40's,

nerdy, sidles up beside him and

whispers furtively in his ear.

TIM

(whispering)

Chemicals?  Some say problems, others

say solution.  Imagine a cloud that

when it rains prohibits the growth

of poppies or takes the THC out of

marijuana.  Imagine a pill that

eliminates any psychological craving,

from Dilaudid to Dove Bars.  Law

enforcement hasn't let science sit

on the sidelines.  Addiction is no

more relevant than polio or the Black

Plague.

ECONOMIST

(to the undersecretary)

You're not battling traffickers or

dealers, but a market, and the market

contains a paradox: if you arrest

traffickers, you raise prices, and

you also raise profits, which brings

more traffickers into the business.

UNDERSECRETARY

(to the Economist)

Back in the real world, we're talking

about Mexico and not John Maynard

Keynes.  We will spend 18 billion

dollars this year on this "war," and

the question on the table every year

is do we certify Mexico as an ally

or not?

RUSH PHILLIPS

You want to make a difference, hit

the users. You don't jeopardize our

financial markets by some hypocritical

stance on drug consumption.  We're

snorting it, why penalize Mexico for

supplying it?

UNDERSECRETARY

Mexico, don't talk to me about

Mexico --

ECONOMIST

It's the stick of law enforcement

that creates the carrot of huge

profits... That's economic truth --

RUSH PHILLIPS

Addicts don't vote; they don't have

PACs; they don't spend soft money,

that's political truth --

UNDERSECRETARY

We're locking them up and

consumption is falling --

ECONOMIST

The price of coke and heroin has

dropped and purity has increased.

All this law enforcement has achieved

is kids can get better stuff, cheaper.

In economic terms, you can forget

it; this is not a winnable war.

RUSH PHILLIPS

Christ, you want to decertify

somebody, take Pakistan or Columbia.

We don't need them for anything.

ECONOMIST

If you manage to seize an

inconceivable 50 percent of all drugs

coming into this country, you'll

still raise the price of coke and

heroin less than 3 percent which

won't affect drug use at all.

RUSH PHILLIPS

Why are we calling this a war at

all?  You don't declare war on your

own people.  Addiction is a little

worm that gnaws a house apart from

the inside.

UNDERSECRETARY

We need Mexico for these reasons:

number one -- Defense; two -- Trade;

three -- Tourism; then, way on down

the line, comes Drugs.  The President

knows this.  Why's he holding

everybody's feet to the fire?

MICHAEL

(solemn)

Mr. Wakefield, there's a situation

that needs your attention right away.

RUSH PHILLIPS

(oblivious)

One in sixteen Americans is of Mexican

descent.  Mexico our third largest

trading partner...

ROBERT

You're looking pretty good for an

old guy.

MICHAEL

My work keeps me young.

ROBERT

Which part, getting terrorists loose

on bail or freeing convicted murderers

on technicalities?

MICHAEL

The worst serial killer in history -

who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty

two people.  Our government killed

fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied

about it every day.

ROBERT

Michael, you represent drug dealers,

not civil libertarians.

MICHAEL

We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama.

Is that covered in your Constitution?

Because it isn't in mine.

ROBERT

Noriega is a criminal.

MICHAEL

Noriega was head of a sovereign nation

who made the mistake of doing business

with the U.S.  Government.  So, no,

I don't have a problem waking up

every day and fighting our government,

fighting people like you, trying to

keep this system a little bit honest.

ROBERT

(amused)

Last I read your clients were chopping

people up with chainsaws and

delivering illegal narcotics into

this country.

MICHAEL

I hope when you were on the bench,

Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle

the presumption of innocence in the

same fashion.

ROBERT

If I ever return to the bench,

Counselor Adler, I hope I have the

pleasure of hearing your arguments.

CUT TO:

GORDON

You planning on going somewhere,

Eduardo?  You don't like it here?

This is the best situation you're

going to have for a long, long time.

RUIZ

I am a legitimate business.  Fishing

boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax

records, everything --

GORDON

Listen you motherfucker, you tried

to kill me with a fucking cannon.

RUIZ

You can't visit me here.  I want my

lawyer.

GORDON

The amount of coke we got on you

means capital punishment in some

states.

CASTRO

Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.

GORDON

We got you on tape making the deal.

We got you bragging about the quality.

We got you bragging about your

business.  We got you.

GORDON

One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us

believe you got a boss.  No boss,

it's all on you.

RUIZ

It's a death sentence.  I'll never

make it to the trial.

GORDON

We can protect you.

CASTRO

Who do you work for?

RUIZ

This is coercion.

GORDON

That's a big word for a fisherman.

CASTRO

Who do you work for?

RUIZ

I know another word... Immunity.

CUT TO:

DAVID

Daddy!

CARL

Hello.  Hello.

CARL

(into phone)

I'm sorry, Jonas.  I don't care if

that is the price you have gotten in

order countries.

CARL

This is America, a different country.

I am Carl, a different man.  So you

see, everything about our situation

is different and I believe the pricing

will be different, too.

(beat, listens)

You're a reasonable man... So take

the weekend to think about it.

CARL

Every day with this guy is like

starting all over again.

CARL

Hi.

HELENA

Hi.

CARL

What's up?

HELENA

Just watching you.

CARL

I got that.  How was your day?

CARL

You all right?

HELENA

I keep feeling like I'm forgetting

something.

HELENA

David, come inside --

CARL

What is this?  What is going on?

GORDON

Mr. Ayala?

CARL

That's right.

GORDON

You're under arrest for violation of

Federal Narcotics laws.

GORDON

We have a warrant to search your

home, Mrs. Ayala.

CUT TO:

AIDE

(to Manolo)

Not you.  You.

SALAZAR

Javier Rodriguez.  Twenty-nine years-

old.  Graduated from Montessori

school.  Five years as a beat cop in

TJ.  Three years with the State

Police.  Parents died four years ago

in their apartment from carbon

monoxide poisoning because they could

not afford to fix their gas heater.

Your sister works in a Maquiladora

in Juarez, making designer blue-jeans.

On the police force three years, you

currently make 316 dollars a month.

SALAZAR

That's your past.  I want to talk

about your future.  Would you be

willing to do something for me?

JAVIER

If I can.

SALAZAR

I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.

JAVIER

What is it you want me to do?

SALAZAR

A small thing.  Nothing really.

JAVIER

Does this offer include my partner?

SALAZAR

Only if he can be trusted.

JAVIER

He'll do what I say.

SALAZAR

His name is Francisco Flores.  He is

a killer and gun smuggler for the

Tijuana cartel.  I need to speak

with him.  I need you to find him

and bring him to me so that I can

speak with him.

MANOLO

This is fucking crazy.  Instead of

killing us, he sends us on a suicide

mission.  Do you know who Frankie

Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead-

hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed

fucking who knows how many people.

You'd need half the force to get

close to him.  And you can't get

their help because he lives in fucking

San Diego.

JAVIER

Then I guess I'm going by myself.

CUT TO:

ROBERT

What's it like?

(thinks)

Imagine you're being accosted by a

swarm of beggars in the heart of

Calcutta, except the beggars are

wearing $1500 suits and they don't

say "please" or "thank you."

CAROLINE

What about legalizing everything?

Has anybody talked about that?

ROBERT

Fine -- legalization.  Okay,

forgetting all of our international

trade agreements, legalize everything

today.  The Government inserts itself

into all drug transactions.  The

U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our

borders are mobbed, lines of people

from here to Europe wanting to smoke,

snort and shoot themselves into

oblivion.

BARBARA

(lightly)

Like a Grateful Dead Concert.

ROBERT

Drugs begin pouring out of America

into every other country in the world.

Canada is completely overwhelmed.

CAROLINE

What if every country legalized at

the same time?

ROBERT

(smiles)

Somehow, I don't see that happening.

BARBARA

So you know we put the case before

the arbitration panel, none of whom

had any expertise.  Superfund is

just one of those words.  People

stop paying attention.

ROBERT

That's frustrating.

BARBARA

It's so frustrating.

CAROLINE

(to Robert)

Did you meet the President?

BARBARA

Honey, your father knows the

President.

ROBERT

As it happens, the President of the

United States, my new boss, the leader

of the free world, has me penciled

in for some "face time".

CAROLINE

Will we get invited to the White

House?

ROBERT

I don't know.

CAROLINE

How long's the job?

ROBERT

It's a presidential appointment so...

until I quit or get fired.

BARBARA

Czar for life, just like a real czar.

CAROLINE

That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a

Czarette.  Like Anastasia.

CAROLINE

None of my friends can fucking believe

my dad is the actual Drug Czar.

BARBARA

Caroline --

CAROLINE

Sorry, but I mean, come on.

CAROLINE

It's great, daddy.  It's just amazing,

that's all.

CUT TO:

ARNIE

Helena, I'm so sorry --

HELENA

Arnie, thank God.

HELENA

Can you please tell me what on earth

is going on?

ARNIE

I understand.  You're upset.  You

want to know what's going on.  That's

good.

HELENA

Why are you talking like that?

ARNIE

Listen to me carefully.  First of

all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him

and they'll hang on to him until

arraignment, which will probably be

tomorrow.  So here you're wasting

your time.  Are you with me?

ARNIE

Good.  From now on I want you to

expect that every word you utter

will be tape-recorded, that the

movement of your lips is being read.

Got it?

HELENA

Arnie, this is crazy.

ARNIE

Got it?

(she slowly nods)

Good.  Do not discuss anything over

the telephone.  Do not talk to the

neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.

HELENA

What is he being charged with?

ARNIE

I don't know, but under no

circumstances would I talk about it

here.  I want you to go home and

relax the best you can.  Continue

your life as if nothing has happened.

That is very important.

HELENA

Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping

through the looking glass.

ARNIE

That's a very apt analogy, Helena.

Now, go home and be with your

children.

LATER

Javi is working on his second beer

when he seems to recognize somebody.

SALAZAR

(clearly pleased with

Javi)

I'm curious how you did this with

such economy.

JAVIER

Everybody has a weakness.

CUT TO:

CAROLINE

All I'm saying, what I'm saying, is

it never seems like anybody ever

says anything that matters to them,

like we all look at each other and

nod with responses we've been trained

to make, not real responses, just

social conventions, phony, fake

smiles, surface bullshit... I mean,

we're all smart and do we have any

idea what each other are like, really

like?  Do I know what Seth's afraid

of, or Vanessa, or fucked-up Bowman?

CAROLINE

...Probably, but do I ever say this

stuff, just say, "hey, I'm

uncomfortable in this crowd, I don't

know what the fuck I'm doing, either?

I know you're afraid and it's okay--

"

SETH

We act like we have all the answers

and we're totally invincible like

our parents seem and their parents

before them and it's fucking bullshit --

FUCKED-UP BOWMAN

For instance --

SETH

For instance I know you jack-off

thinking about Caroline even though

you're supposedly "in love" with

Vanessa.  Whatever the fuck that

means?

(a digression)

I mean, what is that convention,

anyway?  We're all these random

collections of self-interest, and

then we just decide that now we're

two people walking along --

CAROLINE

And Vanessa doesn't think she's pretty

so she does all these weird fucking

diets which is totally about self-

esteem.  And she's beautiful.

(beat)

And that's not even fair.  Because

listen to me.  I'm fucking lying

right now.  This is exactly what I'm

talking about... I'm supposedly

talking about you, making some big

point about you, and it's really

about me.  So I should talk about

me, not you, not even the universal

"you..."

(takes a beat)

Okay.  Okay, I'm worried I'm not

really smart or that I'm not nearly

as smart as people think I am, or

that my parents' expectations have

been way too high since I was five,

I mean who knows they're going to

Harvard when they're five, not that

I'm blaming them for anything because

everything's great, and I may not

even get in, but we all feel this

shit and we never acknowledge it and

if we can't acknowledge it to the

people we care the most about then

who will we ever say it too and what

kind of life will that be?

FUCKED-UP BOWMAN

I jack-off thinking about Seth.

Everybody I know does.

CAROLINE

(disgusted)

Ach, that's what I'm talking about.

Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm.

You're afraid and you think if you

admit it people will think you're

weak or won't like you --

SETH

We live our lives by these unspoken

rules that are handed to us.

VANESSA

Let's be different --

FUCKED-UP BOWMAN

I can't feel my hands.

FUCKED-UP BOWMAN

I'm serious --

VANESSA

He's blue.  He isn't breathing --

CAROLINE

Is he breathing?

SETH

What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up

Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We

need a doctor.

VANESSA

Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --

SETH

He's a research doctor.  You're

dad's a doctor, too --

VANESSA

What kind of research?

SETH

Mapping the fucking pig genome.

We'll call your dad, he's a

neurosurgeon --

VANESSA

It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed

to be here.  I snuck out --

CAROLINE

Are you kidding...  I'm staying

with you --

SETH

He's gonna fucking die right here

on the kitchen floor --

ANOTHER KID

He can't.  My parents are in

Barbados --

SETH

Nobody has anything on them, right?

CUT TO:

TORTURER

We know Tijuana Cartel gunmen killed

our chief of intelligence, Francisco.

We know you killed police commanders

in Tijuana and Mexico City.  Why do

you resist?

FRANCISCO

My father is rich.  He'll pay you.

TORTURER

Not the correct answer, my friend.

TORTURER

We know that you went after the

neighbor of General Salazar, a simple

alfalfa farmer.  His grand-daughter

was shot.  This is stupid behavior,

Francisco.

HELENA

Thank you so much, but I had a lot

It's a turnout because it's a

ALEX

I've met her husband, as nice as

they come.

STEWIE

It teaches me a valuable lesson...

(re: the nice house)

Apparently crime pays.

NAN

Silly, you knew that already.

TUXEDO

Hello. Thank you.  Thank you all. I

CAROLINE

I volunteer.  I read to blind people.

CAROLINE

Yeah.

SOCIAL WORKER

I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a

SOCIAL WORKER

You wanna tell me what you're doing

here, Caroline?

BARBARA

Oh, honey.  Are you all right?

CAROLINE

Did you tell Dad?

BARBARA

Not yet.

CAROLINE

Are you going to?

BARBARA

I don't know.

CAROLINE

Is this bad for him?

BARBARA

What do you think?

CUT TO:

HELENA

(quietly)

I am on the board of my son's school.

I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my

front yard.  I have a right to know

if my husband is a legitimate

businessman.

ARNIE

Of course he is.  I've known him for

twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...

ARNIE

...Carl is a very important member

of this community and when we're

through suing the police and the

district attorney and the DEA, they'll

have to rename the public parks for

your husband.

ARNIE

(whispering)

Your husband is very good at his

job...

ARNIE

Which is smuggling illegal drugs

into this country.

CASTRO

They're whispering.  I can't hear

them, but I know it.  I smell

conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating

out of the home.

GORDON

She ain't in on it.

CASTRO

I have dreams about this, actual

dreams about busting the top people,

the rich people, the white people.

GORDON

I'm telling you, she doesn't know

shit.

CASTRO

She knows Arnie Metzger.

GORDON

So does half of San Diego.

CASTRO

You want to make a wager on this?

HELENA

If all our assets are frozen and our

"sales force" has scattered...  How

am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving

birth in three months.  How do I get

through this?

ARNIE

You're gonna get through it, but the

first thing we do is get Michael

Adler to represent Carl.  We get

Adler and we beat this thing.

HELENA

How much do I pay him?

ARNIE

I suspect he'll accept his payment

in publicity.

CUT TO:

ROBERT

Caroline?  How well did you know

this boy who overdosed?

CAROLINE

He didn't hang around us.  He's like

one of those hippie kids.  I'm not

part of that group.  It was a party

in all these rooms.  His girlfriend

who I barely know was completely

hysterical... He's blue, he's

puking... We didn't want to get in

trouble, but what were we supposed

to do?

(beat)

I mean, what would you have done if

you had been us?

BARBARA

How well do you know this boy, Seth,

who was driving?  You know the police

have charged him with a DUI and

possession of marijuana.

CAROLINE

He's a friend.  He's also like the

only one who was dealing with the

situation.  He'd definitely had a

few beers, but it's not like he wanted

to drive.  We didn't know what else

to do.

(beat)

It wasn't my pot.

ROBERT

Okay, honey.  We understand.  You're

mother and I have to talk.

BARBARA

Honey, we'd like to talk alone.

CAROLINE

Like always.

ROBERT

I think she's lying.

BARBARA

Me, too.

ROBERT

(reaching a decision)

We'll ground her, clip her wings a

bit.  School and scheduled activities

and that's it until further notice.

This has to be handled delicately.

Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's

office, will probably help us out,

quietly.  Christ, this could be

embarrassing.

BARBARA

Honey, this is difficult, but we've

all had our moments.  I tried --

ROBERT

Stop.  You experimented in college.

I don't want to hear about that.

BARBARA

Should we take the quotes off

experiment and call it what it is?

ROBERT

This is different.

BARBARA

Why?

ROBERT

To begin with, she's only sixteen

years-old.

BARBARA

I think she has to find out for

herself, on her own.  We have to

allow her space --

ROBERT

Space for what?  To O.D. like that

other kid?  I will not send the

message that this type of behavior

is okay with her parents.  Because

it isn't.  Correct?

BARBARA

We don't want to push her away.

These are growing experiences.

ROBERT

How long have you known about this?

ROBERT

(yelling)

How long have you known?

BARBARA

Six months.  I found some marijuana,

that's all.  And a little pipe about

two inches long.  I talked with her.

She said her friends smoked pot and

drank --

ROBERT

Explain to me how you could think

that I shouldn't know about this.

Explain to me how this wouldn't be

relevant to me.  As a parent.

BARBARA

She asked me not to.

CUT TO:

SALAZAR

You watch and learn.  I earn his

trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear

with kindness.  Within a week he

will follow me around like a dog.

JAVIER

But will he be house-trained?

SALAZAR

When he loves me like a father, he

will never tell anyone he was here.

He will freely give the names of his

superiors.  Then we get them and

they too will give us names.  And

eventually somebody will get us to

Juan Obregon and the cartel will

fall.

SALAZAR

This is shameful.  A disgrace.

Francisco Flores --

SALAZAR

It's all right, son.  It's all right.

Salazar is here.  You're among

gentlemen, now.  This shameful

treatment will stop immediately.

(calling out)

Guard!

SALAZAR

I want to know who is responsible

for this treatment.

GUARD

Yes, sir!

SALAZAR

We aren't barbarians.

GUARD

Yes, sir!

SALAZAR

Bring this man a change of good

clothes.  Has he eaten?

GUARD

I don't know, sir.

SALAZAR

(to Francisco)

You will dine with me from now on.

CUT TO:

PROSECUTOR

This is a man who heads a large

criminal organization with

international contacts we can only

begin to understand.  Our case against

him is very strong.  He is not a

flight risk.  His flight is assured.

The people ask that your honor denies

bail.

ADLER

My client is no more a flight risk

than your Honor or the able

prosecutor.  He is a pillar of his

community, a family man with a wife

and child in La Jolla, the community

where he has made his home for over

twenty years.  As our defense will

quickly show, my client is guilty of

nothing more than being a handy target

for an admitted criminal.  Therefore

we ask that you release Carl Ayala

on his own recognizance.

JUDGE

I'm gonna deny bail.

REPORTER

Mrs. Ayala, were you aware your

husband is the largest cocaine

smuggler in America?

ADLER

Alleged, people, alleged.

REPORTER #2

Mrs. Ayala is it true your husband

has ordered a hit on Eduardo Ruiz?

ADLER

Carl Ayala sits on the board of the

Children's Hospital.  He is heavily

involved with Adult Literacy.  He

has a small boy and another child on

the way.  If you spread this kind of

innuendo, you can expect legal

recourse.  Are we clear on this point?

CUT TO:

ROBERT

I appreciate you coming in so early.

A.D.A. KELLY

Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to

handle it for you.  Consider it gone

away.  She's a minor; it probably

would've expunged on her 18th birthday

anyway.

ROBERT

Still, this was a sensitive issue

for me and I wanted to thank you

personally.

A.D.A. KELLY

Like I said, open container, P.I.,

Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to

make it disappear.  For you, poof,

it's gone.

A.D.A. KELLY

One thing bothers me...  That kid

they dropped off had coke and heroin

in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky

he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's

your daughter on?

ROBERT

I don't know what you mean.

A.D.A. KELLY

I mean, did you ask her?  What kind

of drugs has she tried?

ROBERT

I... I don't really know.

A.D.A. KELLY

Is she in any kind of therapy...

professional help?

ROBERT

No, of course not.  She's one of the

top students at her school.

A.D.A. KELLY

Well, I hope it stays that way.

ROBERT

(into phone)

It's Robert.  Wipe your schedule

clean for the next three days.  I'm

tired of talking to experts who never

set foot outside the beltway.  It's

time to see the front lines.

CUT TO:

GORDON

You should see little Montel play.

Little Montel is the next Maradona.

CASTRO

Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of

God, my ass.  We're wasting our time

here.

GORDON

He won.  He was a winner.  That

bothers you.

CASTRO

Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't

you been reading the bumper stickers?

GORDON

What do we have here?

ON THE MONITOR:

David kicking a soccer ball with an

older strange man, TIGRILLO, Latino,

40's, fit and tough looking.

HELENA

David, come back here this minute.

David!

HELENA

David --

DAVID

We're playing!

STRANGE MAN

Yeah, this is fun.

HELENA

Please put down my son.

STRANGE MAN

Shouldn't let your kid wander off

with strangers.

HELENA

Thank you.  That's a valuable lesson.

David, come on.

STRANGE MAN

Mrs. Ayala --

STRANGE MAN

Your husband owes a lot of money.

Enough that snapping this kid's neck

wouldn't nearly cover it.

STRANGE MAN

You better come up with it in a hurry

or your kid is going to disappear,

and he won't turn up until the evening

news.

STRANGE MAN

You get exactly one warning.

STRANGE MAN

The first payment is three million

dollars.

GORDON

Are you getting this on tape?

CASTRO

I love my job.  I love it.  The next

time I'm having a bad day you gotta

remind me of right now and I'll get

over it.

JAVIER

Who?

MANOLO

Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --

JAVIER

Your new friends.

MANOLO

Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna

come?

JAVIER

Not this time.

FRANCISCO

In my home I have B&W speakers.  I

recently purchased a compact disc

burner.  I can make my own cd's,

with whatever music I like, as if I

bought them at the store, only I

don't have to pay these crazy prices.

SALAZAR

We have much in common.  We both

attended school in the United States,

and both of our fathers are engineers.

FRANCISCO

I got into stereo equipment when I

was a kid.  Some people don't notice

the difference but it is very

important to me.

SALAZAR

Of course it is.  Have some more

wine.

SALAZAR

Now, Francisco, my friend... I must

know where these men are who killed

my captains.  Not where they were

last week, but where they are today,

and better still, tomorrow.

You are clever.  You can predict

where they will be, can't you?

FRANCISCO

I can't go home.  I don't want to

go.  Please don't make me.

JAVIER

It's not our decision.

FRANCISCO

I'll be killed.

JAVIER

Stop complaining.  Nobody knows what

you've been up to.

CUT TO:

RUIZ

Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in

the family connection business: real

estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out

of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries.

He met up with the Obregon brothers

of the Tijuana Cartel who were

interested in two things: entering

society and using his fishing boats.

GORDON

So you pay off our customs officials?

RUIZ

In Mexico law enforcement is an

entrepreneurial activity, this is

not so true for the USA.

(condescending)

Using regression analysis we made a

study of the customs lanes at the

border and calculated the odds of a

search.  The odds are not high, and

we found variables that reduce the

odds.  We hire drivers with nothing

to lose.  Then we throw a lot of

product at the problem.  Some get

stopped.  Enough get through.  It's

not difficult.

CASTRO

You'd think he wasn't sitting here

facing life in prison.

RUIZ

This has worked for years and it

will continue to work for years.

NAFTA makes everything more difficult

for you.  The border is disappearing.

(pointing at them)

You people are like those Japanese

soldiers left behind on deserted

islands who think that World War II

is still going on.

(with total disdain)

Let me be the first to  tell you,

your government surrendered this war

a long time ago.

GORDON

(to Castro)

This attitude's not gonna help him

any, is it?

RUIZ

I got greedy.  I decided to bring a

little in on my own and somebody

tipped you off.  That was my mistake.

Carl would never be so stupid.

GORDON

He hired you.  That was a mistake.

RUIZ

Carl and I were friends from

childhood.  He was loyal, that's not

a mistake.

OFFICIAL

The busiest land border crossing in

the world.  Over forty-one thousand

vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand

pedestrians on foot.  I think we do

a pretty good job but we know a lot

of drugs are still getting through.

ROBERT

Any idea how much?

OFFICIAL

I've read official estimates but I

wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've

heard the entire cocaine supply for

the United States can fit into four

tractor-trailers.

(gestures to the

traffic)

At least a half-dozen of those cars

right out there are carrying a load

of dope, with drivers employed by

people who don't give a damn if

they're caught or not.

ROBERT

What do you look for?

OFFICIAL

We ask questions and measure the

answers.  When something doesn't

ring true, a fact that doesn't make

sense, a slight hesitation, then

it's off to secondary for a closer

look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9

million trucks a year.  Now it's

almost double.  Pretty soon there'll

be Mexican truck companies that will

have as much freedom in crossing the

border as American truck companies.

ROBERT

Any way we can do it better?

OFFICIAL

Sure.  More money in intelligence on

their side of the border.  So we

have a better idea who we're looking

for.  More dogs.  More people.

Supposed to be getting some giant x-

ray machines to run the trucks

through.  Outside of martial law

that's about the best you're gonna

do.

(beat)

But, I should tell you, there are

two things that really have us on

edge right now.

(beat)

In the last six months seizures have

tripled, even though we're pulling

over the same number of cars.  What

does that tell you?

ROBERT

That triple the amount of stuff is

going through.

OFFICIAL

Right.  But, that's not the biggest

problem.  One of our Intel officers

picked up information from DEA that

traffickers have come up with a

process, a chemical process, to turn

coke into something else.  It doesn't

smell like coke.  It doesn't look

like coke.  And what's worse, it

doesn't react to field test.  It

could be anything.  Maybe it's already

happening.  I mean, how would we

know?

CUT TO:

HELENA

(to phone)

Yes, hi Jenny, account number 4168

2245 3173... I need a cash advance.

HELENA

What's the largest amount I can get?

(listens)

Okay, I guess that'll have to do.

VOICE (O.S.)

(over their headsets)

Okay.  She's coming out.  She's

leaving her property.  Okay, she

seems to be heading for the van!

She is approaching the van!

GORDON

What do we do?

CASTRO

I don't know.

GORDON

What do you think she wants?

CASTRO

She's your girlfriend.  Open it,

talk about your kids.

HELENA

I so hope I didn't startle you.  I

thought you might like some cold

lemonade.

GORDON

Uh... Thank you.

HELENA

I know this is a difficult situation

and you're only doing your jobs.  I

don't bear you any ill-will, but I

do have a small favor to ask.

CASTRO

You want to ask us a favor?

HELENA

A man threatened my children.

These charges have attracted a lot

of attention and it seems to be

bringing all the nut-jobs out of the

nut jar.

(beat)

Would you keep an eye out for anything

out of the ordinary.  I don't know

what else to do.

GORDON

Of course, we will.

HELENA

Thank you.

CASTRO

It's probably poisoned.

GORDON

It's good.  Not too sweet.

want?

ANNA

I can't find Manolo.

JAVIER

He's not here.

He never came home last night.  Was

he with you?

JAVIER

No.

ANNA

I'm worried.  Last time he was out

late, I went through his clothes

while he was asleep.

JAVIER

I'll find him.

JAVIER

What the fuck are you doing?

You're supposed to be at work.

Look at you.

MANOLO

It's no problem.  I was just with

everybody we work with.

JAVIER

Oh, really.  General Salazar was

there?

MANOLO

No, but a lot of other people.  You

should come.  You should come out

with us.

JAVIER

Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to

work.  Salazar is heading down to

Mexico City next week and I'm not

getting left behind.  Don't fuck

this up.

pills every day?  He and my mom have

cocktail hour every night, from six

to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --

CAROLINE

Maybe we could show up and smoke a

little rock with them to unwind --

SETH

Yeah, then some dope to take the

edge off at the end of a long day.

CAROLINE

Have you done your homework, honey?

SETH

Yes, mom --

CAROLINE

Then here's a little bump.

SETH

Drugs weren't even a problem until a

hundred years ago when the white men

in power declared them a problem.

Opiates.  But, who was using 'em?

Chinese immigrants.  Slave labor.

And the darkies up in the inner cities

dancing to them evil rhythms of ju-

ju music.  People on the fringe.

Artists.  Decadent rich people.  And

who got scared?  White men in power.

Who's scared today?  White men in

power.  If J.P. Morgan and John D.

Rockefeller ever admitted using,

it'd be a whole different story.

STREET DEALER

What you want?

SETH

911, and the come down.

STREET DEALER

How much?

SETH

Two hundred of C, hundred of the

other.

CAROLINE

Come on... We've been here before.

STREET DEALER

Then, let's see your money.

STREET DEALER

Up the steps.  You the experts.  You

know what to do.

JUNKIE

What are you two, about twelve?

CAROLINE

Fuck off.

SETH

Caroline, give me your money.

SKETCH

Goodbye... Caroline.

SETH

(under his breath)

Yeah, right.

STREET DEALER

Now, get the fuck out of here.

SETH

We'd like room 205.

DESKMAN

Then you hand me twenty-eight dollars.

SETH

I love this place.

SETH

Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd

and Nancy?

CAROLINE

I think so.  If she didn't she should

have.

(checks her watch)

I've only got maybe an hour.  Then

volleyball practice is over and I

have to be home.

SETH

Why?  Nobody's there.

CAROLINE

(blowing out the hit)

The maid... They ask her what time I

get back.  She spies for them.

CAROLINE

I wish we could stay here.  Just be

here forever and ever.  Make it a

I want to have sex and do a hit right

as we're coming.

I mean, who runs interdiction on the

SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE

I don't know.  I don't think there's

See the problem is the Juarez cartel

owns everything and everybody, all

the property on the Mexican side,

sometimes all the property on both

sides.  Warehouses, transportation,

even tunnels.  It's very organized.

ROBERT

I want everyone thinking out the box

for a second.  What are we gonna do

about Mexico?

(silence)

Come on, guys.  Out of the box.

REP FROM DEA

Unlimited funds?

ROBERT

Unlimited.

REP FROM DEA

From a DEA standpoint we need a vetted

task force and matching funds.  And

cut the red tape on getting them

equipment and training.

ROBERT

Come on.  I want to hear from

everyone: FBI.  Customs.  Treatment.

Is there anyone from treatment on

this plane?

(no one answers)

Then I want an answer for why there

isn't anyone from treatment.

(beat)

Look, we know we have to bust one of

these cartels, Juarez or Tijuana,

not just as a symbol, but hell yes,

also as a symbol - they are symbols -

and there's nothing wrong with sending

a message.  That's why when Carlos

Ayala hired Michael Adler lead

defense, I flew Ben Williams to San

Diego to prosecute.  Because he's

the best we have, he's our symbol

that we're serious about putting the

top people away.

(beat)

So, as of right now, this flight

only, consider the dam on new ideas

thrown open.

ROBERT

If I'm not mistaken, we got DEA,

Pentagon, U.S. Attorneys office,

about a billion dollars of budget

right here.  So what are you people

waiting for?

CUT TO:

ARNIE

On a clear day you can see Mexico

City.

ARNIE

This place is swept twice a day.  I

learned that in Miami in '85.  Then

the U.S. shut down the whole

Caribbean, but it's a big game of

wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami,

it pops up here.  And San Diego is

so much more relaxing.

HELENA

Arnie, I need money.  Somebody

threatened my children.  They want a

first payment of three million

dollars.

ARNIE

Helena, if I had it I would give it

to you, but I don't have that kind

of money.

HELENA

Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe

us money?

ARNIE

Yes, I told you before, there are

people who owe you money but they're

not paying.  There's too much heat

on Carl.

HELENA

Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.

ARNIE

Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you.

You do not want to come into contact

with these people.  Only Carl knows

who they are.  That's his real asset.

Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't

know Ruiz.  Church and State.

HELENA

What about legitimate businesses?

We own a construction concern, real

estate --

ARNIE

Laundromats for the washing of money.

Unfortunately, Carl had only one

successful business.

HELENA

Don't you have some good news?  Isn't

there something positive you could

say.

HELENA

(vulnerable)

Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if

Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very

adept at being on my own.  I've always

had a man in my life.  Always.

ARNIE

I remember when I first met you:

little Helen Watts from the wrong

side of somewhere.  I had a feeling

even then that your survival instincts

were pretty well honed.

HELENA

I'm glad you think so, but I'm

picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two

year-old mother whose ex-husband is

being compared to Pablo Escobar.

(beat)

And I'm wondering who would want to

be with someone like that?

CUT TO:

ROSARIO

You two don't like me, do you?

JAVIER

We don't have an opinion on you.

ROSARIO

(to Javi)

Maybe it's because I'm getting an

apartment nicer than anything you'll

ever see in your life?

ROSARIO

(re: the neighborhood)

I can't believe the old man kept his

promise.

JAVIER

The General is a man of his word.

ROSARIO

They will say anything to get what

they want, but then you remind them,

it's always tomorrow, tomorrow,

tomorrow.

(beat)

Occupational hazard, I guess.

ROSARIO

His friend is giving us the apartment

so it's not like he paid.  It's more

like a favor.

ROSARIO

You don't have the keys.  Oh that's

perfect.  Are you an idiot?

MANOLO

There's supposed to be someone here

to let you in.

MANOLO

Madrigal's alive.

JAVIER

What?

MANOLO

Porfirio Madrigal is not dead.  I

just saw him.

JAVIER

This is why Salazar is so interested

in cleaning up Tijuana.  Madrigal,

who's supposed to be dead, owns him.

And Madrigal is making a move on

Juan Obregon.

MANOLO

Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you

don't care bullshit.  This is

incredible information.  It must be.

Javi --

JAVIER

We keep our mouths shut.

CUT TO:

ROBERT

I think we may have found our Mexican

Drug Czar.  It's this General,

Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody

on the other side I can talk to.

BARBARA

Does this mean you're going to be

gone more?

ROBERT

Possibly.

BARBARA

You might want to pencil in a little

face-time with your daughter.

ROBERT

Barbara --

BARBARA

Because I'm at the edge of my

capabilities, Robert.

ROBERT

The first thing we have to do is

present a unified front.

BARBARA

If you start in on the war metaphors

I'm going to drive this car into a

fucking telephone pole.

ROBERT

Look, I'm as worried as you are --

BARBARA

No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone,

give me money.  That's what I get

from our daughter.  She has a way of

shutting me out that seems very

familiar.

ROBERT

Yeah, well, she has a way of self-

medicating that probably seems

familiar, too.

BARBARA

I'm not the one who has to have three

scotches just to walk in the door

and say hello.

ROBERT

I have a drink before dinner to take

the edge off my day.  That's

different.

BARBARA

Oh, it is?

ROBERT

Yeah, because the alternative is to

be bored to death.

BARBARA

Why don't you go in and tell your

daughter how bored you are.

ROBERT (V.O.)

(muffled by the door)

Caroline.  Open this door immediately.

CAROLINE

(faking the best she

can)

Who is it?  I'm going to the bathroom.

CAROLINE

One minute.

CAROLINE

Excuse me --

ROBERT

You're not going anywhere, young

lady.

ROBERT

Where is it?  Where are the drugs?

(yelling)

Where are they?

CAROLINE

Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything.

You're like the Gestapo.

ROBERT

Fuck me?  Oh, okay.  Fuck me.  Fuck

you.

ROBERT

I'm going to ask you one time to

tell me the truth so that I can help

you.

ROBERT

Okay, young lady, that's it.

CAROLINE

Like I give a fuck.

ROBERT

What is wrong with you?  What?

(beat)

You're going away.  You're getting

help somewhere.

CAROLINE

You can't make me.

ROBERT

Oh, yes I can.

CUT TO:

JAVIER

Where are we going?

HUGHES

Special Agent Hughes, Drug Enforcement

Administration of the United States.

JAVIER

(ignoring the niceties)

Where are you taking me?

JOHNSON

Somewhere safe.

JAVIER

Where?

JOHNSON

A place we have, that we know is

protected.

JAVIER

No.

HUGHES

It's really safe.

JAVIER

Not for me.

JOHNSON

Okay.  Where would you like to go?

JAVIER

It's important that we work together.

Mexico.  America.  One hand washing

the other.

JOHNSON

We agree.

JAVIER

So... maybe you tell me about your

informants in our operations.

JOHNSON

(confused by this)

We thought maybe you'd have that

kind of information for us.

JAVIER

(feigning surprise)

This is a very different proposition.

JOHNSON

We pay for that kind of information.

JOHNSON

Is that what you're talking about,

Javier?

JAVIER

Ten years ago Tijuana had no drug

problem.  Now it is epidemic.

(beat)

Ten years ago America takes a hammer

to Pablo Escobar, a hammer to the

Miami drug trade, and you allowed

everything to move to my country.

You dumped the problem at our feet.

Now, drug use is epidemic.  Now, the

treatment centers are full and get

no state money.  They survive on

donations and what they get for

building doghouses to sell to the

U.S.

(beat)

We need lights for the parks so kids

can play at night.  So they can play

baseball.  So it's safe.  Everybody

likes parks.  Everybody likes

baseball.

(beat)

What I'm talking about is I would

like to see somebody take an interest

in Tijuana.  That's what I'm talking

about.

HUGHES

Javi, You want to come see us again,

you're going on the box.  No more of

this water-wing bullshit.

JOHNSON

You wanna tell me what the hell that

was all about?

HUGHES

He's got something.  We just have to

be patient.

CUT TO:

CARL

How's David?

HELENA

How's David? How's David? He's

terrific, Carl.

CARL

Helena --

HELENA

We watched his father get dragged

away by federal agents.  I don't

even know how to begin to tell him

where you are or when you're coming

back... Or if you're coming back.

CARL

(beat)

We'll get through this, I promise.

I'll make it up to you --

HELENA

(snapping)

How?  Supportive letters from prison

while I'm being kicked out of our

home?

(beat)

Do you have any idea what is happening

out here?  Our credit cards are maxed.

The people at the bank, you should

see their faces when I walk in there.

I have a letter from the government

telling me that anything I sell from

our house will be taken against an

income tax lien.  Our friends are

behaving like the crowd at a public

hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody

will take us in.  Nobody wants

anything to do with us.  So tell me,

Carl, how you're gonna make it up to

me.

(losing it)

Tell me again how we'll get through

this, and maybe while you're at it

you can put your hand up against the

glass so we can have a tender moment

of connection.

CARL

Helena --

HELENA

Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need

guidance, not a fucking platitude.

(beat)

I'm not bringing a child into the

kind of life I grew up with.  I won't

do it.  I want our life back.

CARLOS

I built our house and I don't want

to lose it.  Every stone, every brick,

every board.

(carefully)

My business... That would take a lot

of private study...

(he blinks)

That you don't have time for.  I

suggest you look into the Coronel...

(he blinks again)

Into selling it.  If you can stomach

it, you should look into it.

HELENA

I don't understand.

CARLOS

Look into the Coronel; otherwise,

there is nothing to do.

CUT TO:

MARTY

So it was my birthday an my ex-wife

was getting remarried and I was in

some church basement telling a bunch

of strangers how it was a good day

because I didn't have to eat out of

a dumpster.  That was enough to send

me out on big one.

(beat)

I've been thinking a lot about the

first step: that I came to believe I

was powerless over alcohol and that

my life had become unmanageable.

(beat)

See my disease tells me I don't have

a disease.  That I'm fine.  That

it's my birthday and I can have one

little drink, then one little line,

then one little Valium, then two

more fat lines, then two more 10 mil

Valium... Six months later I wake up

in a sober living house in Philly.

And I'm from Dallas, people.

(beat)

It's a disease -- an allergy of the

body and an obsession of the mind.

I know that now.  So my name's Marty

and today I'm a grateful recovering

alcoholic who didn't eat out of a

dumpster.  Thanks.

CAROLINE

(slowly, very nervous)

Hi.  I'm Caroline.  I'm not sure I'm

an alcoholic.

(beat)

I mean I don't really like to drink.

For someone my age it's so much easier

to get drugs than beer.  I don't

know, this is really weird and I'm

really nervous...

CAROLINE

I guess I'm angry.  I mean I think

I'm really angry about a lot of stuff,

but I don't know what exactly.

CUT TO:

ART APPRAISER

Tamayo.  Carrington.  A simply

wonderful collection of Mexican

Modern.  Give me three months.  I

know several collectors in South

America, very discreet.

HELENA

I don't have three months.

ART APPRAISER

It takes time to find the proper

collection.

HELENA

How much will you give me in cash?

Today.

HELENA

You must be joking.  That's a fraction

of their value.

ART APPRAISER

I'm sorry, but that is the figure I

can get today.

HELENA

(snapping)

Get out.  Get out of my house.

HELENA

It's all right.  We're have a

disagreement, that's all.

CUT TO:

SALAZAR

I recruited the best men in Mexico

for my task force and put them through

a rigorous screening process.  Not

only physical, but also psychological.

ROBERT

I'd like to bring you up to

Washington, walk you around our side

of things, and share some of the

information we've been able to develop

on your cartels.

SALAZAR

That would be very helpful to me.

(beat)

Also, I received the offer from DEA

and the FBI to train some of my men

at Quantico.  I think this will be

extremely useful, a good way for us

to absorb some of your methods.

SALAZAR

I've been too busy to completely

settle in.

ROBERT

You've been making very good progress

against the Tijuana cartel.

SALAZAR

Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon

will be taken into custody before

the end of the year.  But, you must

understand that it is very difficult

because of corruption in the police

force.  We get a tip that he is one

place, then we get there and he is

already gone, having been warned by

someone on our side.

ROBERT

Hopefully the exchange of training

methods and information between our

countries will help with this problem.

SALAZAR

Yes, I hope so as well.

ROBERT

Let me ask you a related question.

We've talked about the supply side,

but what about demand?  What is your

policy for treating addiction?

SALAZAR

Addicts treat themselves... they

overdose and then there's one less

to worry about.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RUIZ

This is ridiculous.  Why is there no

elevator?

GORDON

When the DEA gets into the narcotics

business, then we'll stay at the

Four Seasons.

CASTRO

Eddie, how you like your new home?

I hope you hate it as much as I do.

RUIZ

This is not what my lawyers

negotiated.

GORDON

Fuck your lawyers.  You aren't getting

any cappuccino or Biscotti either.

FRANK

He first came to me in January.

That would've been nineteen eighty-

seven.  He wanted to rent warehouse

space along the harbor.  I didn't

ask too many questions; I'm a

businessman also.

MRS. BERRY

I told Mr. Ayala there were

irregularities in his tax return.

And I couldn't represent him unless

we could explain this...

SHEILA

I was the company secretary from

1991 to 1994.  I supposedly worked

for all six companies.  But... they

weren't... I mean, it was just one

empty office with a desk and a

telephone.  We never sold anything

the whole time I was there.  Sometimes

people came and got paid.  I don't

really know what we did.

PROSECUTOR

Did Mr. Ayala say where the money

came from?

SHEILA

No, and I didn't ask.

PROSECUTOR

Where do you think it came from?

KAUFMAN

This speculation --

PROSECUTOR

I'll rephrase.  Did you feel like

you were engaged in a legal

enterprise?

SHEILA

No, not really.

CUT TO:

FRANCISCO (V.O.)

Who is this?

HELENA

A friend... of Carlos Ayala.

FRANCISCO (V.O.)

Yes.

HELENA

I'm on a special phone, may I speak

freely?

FRANCISCO (V.O.)

You may speak.

HELENA

I have a job for you and I don't

have much time.

FRANCISCO (V.O.)

I love this place.  Don't turn around.

FRANCISCO

You were followed by the police, but

they won't hear us over the children.

I want to use a bomb.

HELENA

You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him

or something?

FRANCISCO

I don't really like guns.  You shoot

someone in the head three times and

some doctor will keep them alive.

HELENA

When will you do it?

FRANCISCO

I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the

only real witness against Carl.  The

security is very tight.  There may

not be a way.

HELENA

There's always a way.  If people get

to the Pope or the President, you

can get to him.

FRANCISCO

Careful... You're sounding like your

husband, Mrs. Ayala.

CUT TO:

JAVIER

What?  What is it?

ANNA

It's very hard for me to come and

tell you this.

ANNA

It's Manolo.  He's going to do

something stupid.  I'm worried that

he'll get himself killed.

ANNA

He's saying he's going to talk to

the Americans.  Become an informer.

JAVIER

Why does he need money?

ANNA

He has debts.  He has gambling debts.

He owes a lot of money.

JAVIER

How much?

ANNA

Nine thousand dollars.

JAVIER

What is he planning on telling them?

ANNA

Well, you know, he's going to say

about Madrigal... and Salazar.

CUT TO:

ROBERT

(into phone)

Nobody saw her leave?

(beat)

Yes... I understand.

ROBERT

I have to go.  I have to go home.

BARBARA

Should we bring the police into this?

ROBERT

No, not yet.

SETH

(genuinely surprised)

She's not at that place you sent

her?

ROBERT

She snuck away.  And we haven't seen

her.  She hasn't come home.

SETH

Oh, man --

ROBERT

She hasn't called you?

SETH

I tried to talk to her when she was

up there, but they wouldn't put me

through.

(beat)

I'm surprised she hasn't called.

HUSTLERS

What you want?  Rock?  Rock?  Hey,

what you want?

ROBERT

Can you tell me anything?  Do you

have any ideas?

SETH

I don't know what to say.

ROBERT

I'm not the police.  I don't care

about experimentation.  She's a kid.

I'm worried to death.

SETH

You won't say anything to my parents?

ROBERT

I don't give a fuck about your parents --

SETH

We sometimes went downtown to score.

ROBERT

What?

SETH

The West End.  We buy it off the

streets.

(beat)

I can stop, you know, and she can't.

Two people, really similar, we can

talk about anything, but for me it's

like a weekend thing, then I get my

shit together, and for her it's

different --

ROBERT

You don't know what the hell you're

talking about.  You're a cocky

seventeen year-old and you don't

have a clue what the stakes are.

You don't know the value of the life

you've yet to throw away.  And neither

does she.

FACE

(through the window)

What do you want?

ROBERT

(through the window)

What do you mean, what do I want?

FACE

Rock or dope, man?

ROBERT

I don't want anything.

SETH

Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying

to help.

ROBERT

You want to help?  Stay the fuck

away from her.

ROBERT

I'm looking for my daughter.

SKETCH

What the fuck do you want?

SKETCH

You want some of that?

SKETCH

What you gonna do to get some of

that?

CAROLINE

Please --

SKETCH

What you gonna do?

SKETCH

Maybe a taste.

SKETCH

Feed this to you like a little bird.

CAROLINE

Don't --

SKETCH

You want this?

SKETCH

This is the Express train.  Baby

turnin' pro and getting down in a

big, big hole.

SKETCH

Kiss it.  Kiss your new mommy hello.

CUT TO:

ADLER

Your honor, it has come to our

attention that your honor, while in

private practice, previously

represented the town of Seal Beach

in their stop-work suit against the

Police Department of Seal Beach.  We

believe this disqualifies you from

hearing this case and we therefore

move for a temporary suspension while

this is investigated.

JUDGE

Mr. Adler, this is a most unusual

motion.

ADLER

Nonetheless, your honor, we feel

that our client deserves every

fairness afforded under the law.

JUDGE

If this is in any way designed to

delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz...

JUDGE

We'll recess until 9:00 am Monday

morning.  And I'll see counsel in

chambers.

CASTRO

Remember when we sat on that mob

guy, that chef, for like six months?

GORDON

Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in

my life.

(to Ruiz)

Why don't you develop a useful skill?

CASTRO

Yeah, like turning into a beautiful

woman.

RUIZ

Would you mind if today we walked?

It's one block.  I could use the

fresh air.

FRANCISCO

(into phone)

They're not getting into the car.

What are they doing?  They're walking

right at me.

HELENA

(into phone)

You've got a gun.  Get out of the

car and shoot him in the head.

FRANCISCO

(into phone)

They're going to walk right past me.

HELENA (V.O.)

What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of

the car and do it.  This is your

chance.

CASTRO

Stay here.  I'll get the car.

GORDON

(to the other agents)

I saw this guy at the courthouse.

(beat)

The car --

GORDON

(yelling)

No --

CUT TO:

MAN #1

Manolo, how are you?

MAN #2

Manolo, have we interrupted?

MANOLO

No.  I'm looking for the waiter.  I

want to order.

MAN #1

What are you gonna have?

MANOLO

A steak.

MAN #1

Well, if you like steak, we know a

much better place.  We'll take you

there.

MANOLO

That's okay, really.

MAN #2

Manolo, we should really be going

now, before it gets too crowded.

MANOLO

I was going to feed them wrong

information.  Feed them lies to...

it was for...

MANOLO

Don't tell Anna I died like this.

Tell her it was something else.

Tell her it was official business.

Tell her that I died doing something

honorable.  Please, tell her that

for me...

MAN #1

Turn around.

MAN #1

You got anything you want to say?

MAN #1

Sorry about that... we had to be

sure.

SOMEBODY ELSE

Are you sure you don't have anything

to tell us?

CUT TO:

ARNIE

That was a stupid thing you did.

Incredibly stupid.

HELENA

I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue

to try.

ARNIE

Have you gone crazy?  You are not

Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.

(beat)

They are moving the trial to a high

security location.  The press has

gone berserk.  The jury will be

influenced.  Stay out of things.

Let us try to win the case.

HELENA

That is going to be rather difficult

when all the evidence is against us.

ARNIE

Helena, please.  This is out of your

hands.

HELENA

(softly)

I know I made things worse.  I know

that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need

something from you.  Something only

you can help me with.

ARNIE

Helena --

HELENA

I need an introduction to the Obregon

Brothers.

ARNIE

I can't do that.

HELENA

I figured out what Carl was up to

and I need your help.  Will you help

me?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ROBERT

About the other night, I'm sorry.

BARBARA

Me, too.

ROBERT

God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed

to say to ourselves, be prepared to

lose her, be prepared to lose our

child?

(beat)

Why does this happen to someone?

How does it happen?

BARBARA

I don't know.

CUT TO:

MARQUEZ

Mrs. Ayala.  Thank you for coming.

I am Juan Marquez, I work for Mr.

Obregon.  I believe you know my

associate, "Tigrillo," the Little

Tiger.

HELENA

Yes, he threatened to kill my five

year-old son.

(beat)

I was under the impression I would

be meeting Juan Obregon.

MARQUEZ

No, this is not possible.  And I

thank you for coming down here, though

I suspect it's been a pointless

journey.

HELENA

Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?

MARQUEZ

I hear these stories.  Your husband

in jail.  His business in chaos.

Various people fighting over the

scraps.

HELENA

My husband is the victim of an

informer in your organization, not

ours.

MARQUEZ

That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your

route is compromised.  Perhaps it is

time for me to deal with other

distributors in California.

HELENA

I don't think you're going to do

that.

MARQUEZ

You don't?  Listen to this woman in

a man's world, a very violent world.

HELENA

There are plenty of other suppliers

in Mexico.

MARQUEZ

But not in whose interest it is to

help you out of debt.

HELENA

My husband had been working on

something he called, The Project for

the Children.  Are you aware of this?

MARQUEZ

I don't know.  Perhaps I remember

something.

HELENA

We have the ability to change the

color, odor, and physical property

of cocaine.

MARQUEZ

You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr.

Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing

new.

HELENA

Not in...

HELENA

This doll is cocaine.

HELENA

Every part, from his ears to his

accessory belt, is high-impact,

pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless.

Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable

by anyone.

MARQUEZ

I don't believe you.

HELENA

Get a bowl.

HELENA

Try it.

MARQUEZ

You first.

HELENA

I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do

it.

MARQUEZ

Fine, then we don't have deal.

HELENA

Fine, then we don't have a deal.

MARQUEZ

Okay, okay.

MARQUEZ

That's good coke.

HELENA

It should be... It's yours.

(beat)

I want our debt forgiven.  I want to

be the exclusive distributor of

Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the

United States.  And I want the

principle witness against my husband,

Eduardo Ruiz, killed.

MARQUEZ

Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I

must first ask you to pass a test.

I asked the same of your husband and

he succeeded with flying colors.

MARQUEZ

Take this back with you.  Deliver it

safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and

we have a deal.

HELENA

That's crazy.  My husband is on trial

for smuggling.

MARQUEZ

Exactly, and this is how I know I'm

not getting into business with the

U.S. Government.

HELENA

You will help me with my other

problem.

MARQUEZ

Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in

San Diego.  And we have a deal.

CUT TO:

JAVIER

...And I have the electronic serial

numbers for their cellular phones.

They change them every twenty-four

hours but I have a contact at MexTel

who can get me the new ESNs within

twelve.

HUGHES

That's good shit.

JAVIER

Now that you have what you want,

let's talk about how I get what I

want.

JOHNSON

Oh, don't worry, Javier, you're not

gonna have any problems there.

HUGHES

I want to take a minute and talk

about what type of precautions you're

taking to protect yourself.  When

Salazar and Madrigal go down, they

might send someone to see you.

JAVIER

You worry about getting me the things

that I want.  I'll worry about myself.

JOHNSON

You should feel good about this.

JAVIER

I feel like a traitor.

CUT TO:

CUSTOMS OFFICER

Please step from the car, Ma'am.

HELENA

I'm in a hurry --

CUSTOMS OFFICER

Step from the car, Ma'am.  This won't

take long from your day.

OFFICER

Ma'am, we have to ask you to come

with us.

CUSTOMS MATRON

Ma'am, we have reason to believe you

may have illegal drugs hidden beneath

your clothing.  I need to conduct a

pat down search.  Supervisory

Inspector Haig will witness the

search.

HELENA

You've got to be kidding me.  I'm

pregnant.  What if I refuse?

CUSTOMS MATRON

This pamphlet explains the law and

your rights under it.  You're welcome

to read it first.  It says we have

the authority to conduct this search.

Would you like to read it first or

shall we proceed?

MRS. CASTRO

Montel... Oh, Montel.

MRS. CASTRO

You know how much he cared about

you.  You do, don't you?

GORDON

Yes.

MRS. CASTRO

I know if he could have it back

somehow, he wouldn't do it differently

or have it any other way.  He

wouldn't.  He loved his job.

AGENT

Excuse me, Agent Gordon.  Mrs.

Castro.

(to Gordon)

Helena Ayala left Club Platinum in

Tijuana.  The Obregon Brothers' place.

They stopped her at the border but

she was clean.  She's in San Diego

now.

CUT TO:

HELENA

Did you get it?

ARNIE

What are you thinking, calling me at

home with a message like that?  You've

compromised me and our relationship --

HELENA

(making fun of Arnie)

The place is swept twice a day.  I

learned that down in Miami in '85...

(hard)

Arnie.  I'm the housewife.  I belong

to the most exclusive country club

in La Jolla that accepts Latinos.

Until recently, I believed my husband

imported hydroponic strawberries,

which I donated at the school fair.

HELENA

It's the same stuff?  From the rainy

day stash?

ARNIE

It's the same.  What happened to

what they gave you?

HELENA

I'm desperate, but I'm not stupid.

CUT TO:

ROBERT

Hello.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

I'm sorry... Did I wake you?

ROBERT

No, it's all right.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Salazar's been taken down.  He was

working for Porfirio Madrigal.

ROBERT

What?  I thought Madrigal was dead.

I thought it was verified.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit

storm here right now.  When are you

coming back?

(beat)

I don't know what to tell people any

more.

ROBERT

I'll get there as soon as I can.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

If we're moving the press conference,

we need to do it now.

(beat)

Are you all right?

BARBARA (V.O.)

Robert.

ROBERT

(to Sheridan)

I have to call you back.

BARBARA

The silver wedding cup.

BARBARA

My Leica's gone.

ROBERT

So's the video camera.

BARBARA

At least she's alive.

BARBARA

Where are you going?

ROBERT

She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.

SETH

Hey man, what are you doing?

TEACHER (O.S.)

Excuse me?  Excuse me?

ROBERT

Seth has to be excused.  He's going

on a field trip.

HELENA

Come on.  Time to go.

HELENA

(under her breath)

Women's room, stall two.

(loud)

Should we stop for ice-cream?

DAVID

Yeah!

CUT TO:

SETH

I don't know, maybe we missed her.

ROBERT

I can't believe you used to bring my

daughter here, to this place.

SETH

Hey man, back the fuck up.  To this

place.  What's that shit?  Right

now, all over this country, a hundred

thousand white people from the suburbs

are driving around downtown asking

every black person they see, You got

any drugs?  You know where I can get

drugs?  What kind of effect you think

this has on the psyche of a black

person, on their possibilities?  If

you sent a hundred thousand black

people into your neighborhood, Indian

Hills, and they asked every white

person they saw, hey, you got any

drugs?, within a day, your friends

and their kids would be selling.

It's market forces, man.  The

product's marked up three hundred

percent.  You can go out on the street

and make five hundred bucks in two

hours and then do whatever you want

for the rest of the day.  You think

white people would still be going to

law school?

ROBERT

You're starting to piss me off.  Get

out of the car.

SETH

You're gonna get me killed.

SKETCH

What do you want?

ROBERT

I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline.

She comes here.

SKETCH

This is a business.  Get the fuck

outta here.

ROBERT

I need to find my daughter.  I'll

pay you.

SKETCH

Who the fuck do you think you are?

Where the fuck do you think you are?

Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't

just put you in a dumpster?

ROBERT

I have money --

SKETCH

I got money.

ROBERT

I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I

have it in my wallet.

SKETCH

I want your money, I'll take your

money.

ROBERT

Just tell me where she is.

SKETCH

(to Seth)

Don't do that shit again.

SETH

Great.  What a good idea.

SETH

Man, I'm telling you.  Don't do this

vigilante thing.  Either the cops

find her or she'll call you.  I

promise.

CUT TO:

JAVIER

(calling out)

Anna.  Anna, please.  Let me in.

JAVIER

Come on.  You can't stay locked in

your house all day.

JAVIER

I know this is a tragedy, but you

have to realize that good has come

out of it.

JAVIER

If Manolo hadn't gone and told them

what he did then Salazar and Madrigal

would never have been brought to

justice.  He did a great thing for

Tijuana.  He did a great thing for

Mexico.

ANNA

I want to believe you.  I really do.

JAVIER

You will believe me, because it's

true.

SETH

Open the door.  Open the fucking

door, man.

MUFFLED VOICE

Go away!

SETH

I know she's in there.  Let me talk

to her.

MUFFLED VOICE

I don't know what you're talking

about.  Go away!

SETH

I know she's in there.

JOHN

Hey, I haven't touched her --

CAROLINE

(really out of it)

Hi, Daddy.

CAROLINE

It's gonna be great...  I mean, I'm

okay and all, because, see, I met a

guy, he's in this pretty famous band

and...

(gets up confessional

courage)

They've invited me to write lyrics

for them, I'm gonna be able to do

that and maybe sing, too... not at

first, but later.

CAROLINE

(sounding completely

crazy)

I've been doing research for the

school paper, that's what I've been

doing, like on assignment kind-of,

I've seen some stuff you wouldn't

believe, but I'm gonna write it all

down into lyrics.  They think I'm

really good, everybody says so, what

do you think?

CUT TO:

MARQUEZ

Salazar and Madrigal are no longer

with us.

(beat)

A feat none of these people could

get accomplished.

MARQUEZ

You're going to be made the Special

Assistant to the new drug Czar, which

makes you a very valuable law

enforcement officer.

(beat)

I hope you like to travel because we

have plans for Juarez and El Paso,

Nogales, Sinaloa, Jalisco,

Michoacan...

CUT TO:

ROBERT

(into phone)

How was she?

BARBARA

(into phone)

I'm really not sure.  She seemed to

recognize it wasn't Serenity Oaks.

It's a pretty hard-core facility,

but at least we know where she is.

(beat)

Maybe it's what she needs now.

CUT TO:

AGENT

Big day.

(shows picture in

paper)

You're a star.

GORDON

Go shower.  You smell.

AGENT

Who is it?

SOMEBODY (V.O.)

(through the door)

The Mafia.  I've got his breakfast.

RUIZ

Fuck off.

GORDON

Where's the love gone, Eddie?

RUIZ

You expect me to be grateful for

spending the rest of my life looking

over my shoulder.

GORDON

That thought makes me feel awful.

RUIZ

Can't you for a second imagine none

of this had happened?  That my drugs

had gone through.  What would have

been the harm?  A few people get

high who are getting high anyway.

Your partner is still alive.  We

avoid having breakfast together.

Don't you see this means nothing?

That your whole life is pointless?

GORDON

You're breaking my heart.

RUIZ

The worst thing about you, Monty, is

you realize the futility of what

you're doing and you do it anyway.

I wish you could see how transparent

you are.

(disgusted)

This food tastes like shit.

GORDON

So go shower already.

RUIZ

You only got to me because you were

tipped off by the Juarez Cartel,

who's trying to break into Tijuana.

You're helping them.

(beat)

You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.

GORDON

(yelling after him)

And shave.  You better look nice and

believable for the jury.

GORDON

(to another agent)

It's like having another wife.

GORDON

Who is it?

SOMEBODY ELSE (V.O.)

(though the door)

Breakfast.

SOMEBODY ELSE

Hurry up.  It's getting cold.

MAN WITH TRAY

I'm on your side.  God, you're jumpy.

GORDON

Call an ambulance.  Hurry.

GORDON

(yelling)

Call the ambulance.

(to Ruiz)

Don't die on me.  You will not die

on me.  Do you hear me?  Don't you

die on me.

CUT TO:

PROSECUTOR

Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of

the jury...  Because of the sudden

death of Eduardo Ruiz, the people

have decided that at this point we

cannot continue our case against

Carl Ayala.

CUT TO:

CHIEF OF STAFF

Yeah, hi --

(waves Robert to a

chair)

So I've got a copy of your speech

here...

(glances down, still

reading)

It's fantastic... So, Robert, my

genuine thanks.  You're my choice

and you're gonna be great.  The

President is sorry he hasn't been

able to spend more time with you.

After the press conference he wants

to really sit down.

(an afterthought)

Oh, I got to the Post, too.  Don't

worry about that thing with your

daughter, it's not news; they're

willing to treat it as a family

matter, a personal matter.

(off Robert's stare)

Look, even if it came out, we'd turn

it into a qualification, I've been

in the trenches of this Drug War, I

have seen the face of the enemy,

etcetera.

CUT TO:

JAVIER

(to the press)

This seizure is one of the largest

seizures in Mexican history...  It

represents the first bilateral effort

of the American DEA and the Mexican

I.N.C.D.

JAVIER (V.O. CONT'D)

Today I'm very proud to announce

that Mexico, with the help of our

American partners, is finally winning

the war against narcotics trafficking.

CUT TO:

ROBERT

The cocaine brand, 911, is an East

Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand,

and you must know it usually comes

through into El Paso?

JAVIER

I'm aware of that.

ROBERT

So what's it doing in Tijuana?

ROBERT

Let me ask you a hypothetical

question: if Salazar worked for

Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and

he went out of power, would it mean

the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?

JAVIER

It could mean that, yes.

ROBERT

That would probably mean the Tijuana

Cartel is gaining power?

JAVIER

It's possible.

ROBERT

Is it possible to have a Drug Czar

in Mexico who isn't connected in

some war to one of the cartels?

JAVIER

Yeah, it's possible... if you're

prepared to die.

CUT TO:

CARLOS (V.O.)

It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too

hard.

ARNIE

Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming

right now --

CARLOS

Don't bother.

ARNIE (V.O.)

What?

CARLOS

So Arnie, when were you going to

tell me about the 3 million dollars

we got in from San Francisco two

days after I got arrested?

ARNIE (V.O.)

I was just waiting for the right

time.

CARLOS

And you didn't feel like you could

trust my wife with this news?

ARNIE (V.O.)

I just didn't want to take a chance.

I didn't want to risk it.  It could

have been frozen along with everything

else.

CARLOS

You had it all figured out.  You

move into my house.  You raise my

kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It

was a good plan, Arnie.

ARNIE (V.O.)

Carl, that's insane.

CARLOS

So my wife is lying?

ARNIE (V.O.)

Carl, think about it, if I was trying

to rip you off, I would have left

town after Ruiz was killed.  I

wouldn't sit next to you in court

listening to the dismissal.

CARLOS

Arnie, do think there's a difference

between a reason and an excuse,

because I don't think there is.

ARNIE (V.O.)

Carl --

CARLOS

Goodbye Arnie.

HELENA

Who was that?

CARLOS

Arnie.  He's not going to be able to

make the barbecue.

HELENA

Come downstairs.  Everyone is waiting.

GORDON

Hello, Helena.  What a great party.

CARLOS

Who are you?

GORDON

Nobody.  I'm a nobody who arrested

you, but your wife is a murderer.

SECURITY OFFICER

Hey, you can't be in here.

GORDON

I'm a cop.

SECURITY OFFICER

I don't care.

HELENA

(to the guards)

Throw him out of here.

GORDON

(calling out)

You didn't win, Helena.  You lost

everything.  Tell your children a

nice bedtime story...  How you killed

my partner.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PRESS SECRETARY

...a sterling reputation and close

friend of the President, recently

confirmed into The Office of National

Drug Control Policy... our new Drug

Czar, Robert Hudson Wakefield.

ROBERT

(reading his prepared

speech)

The War on Drugs is a war on our

nation's most precious resource...

our children.  Sixty-eight million

children have been targeted by those

who perpetrate this war and protecting

those children must be priority number

one.

(beat)

There has been progress and there

have been failures, but where we

have fallen short I see not a problem

but an opportunity.

ROBERT

An opportunity to correct the mistakes

of the past while laying a solid

foundation for the future.

(a long, uncomfortable

beat)

This takes not only new ideas, but

perseverance.  This takes not only

resources, but courage.  This takes

not only government, but families.

ROBERT

I've... I've outlined a ten-point

plan, representing a new bilateral

effort...

ROBERT

I can't do this.

(beat)

If there is a War on Drugs then our

own families have become the enemy.

How can you wage war on your own

family?

CAROLINE

On the good days I feel like I get

it, like it all makes sense.  I can

stay in the moment.  I don't have to

control everything in the future.

And I believe everything is going to

work out fine.

(beat)

On the bad days, I just want to grab

the phone and start dialing numbers.

I want to pull my hair and run through

the streets screaming.

(beat)

But, thanks to the people I've met

in these rooms, people like Margaret

and Jim and Sarah, people who've

taught me how to listen, I'm pretty

sure I'll make it through today.

VOICE (O.S.)

Would you like to share?

ROBERT

My name is Robert.  This is my wife,

Barbara.  We're Caroline's parents.

We're just hear to listen.

CUT TO:

CARLOS (V.O.)

(over a listening

device)

We're back up and running.

Completely untouchable.  Completely.
