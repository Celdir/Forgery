THE PROGRAM

SHOOTING DRAFT

SPORTSCASTER'S VOICE (V.O.)

Allright, bowl bid ridin' here for

E.S.U. Fourth down on the Georgia

Tech 18. 4 ticks left. Kane sets 'em

down.

INSTANT CUT TO:

REPORTER #1 (V.O.)

Coach, this is the second year in a

row you've failed to go to a bowl

game. Do you feel your program's in

decline?

WINTERS

(keeping his cool)

No, we're just a young team on the

verge. We'll be back in a major bowl

next year.

ALVIN

Good throw, Joe. It was there.

JOE

So was half their team.

(trailing off)

Shit, another Christmas at home.

ALVIN

Next year, man. Next year we sell

out. Next year we dominate.

REPORTER #2

You still need a deep threat or a

breakaway back to go with Joe Kane.

What are you gonna do to address

this need?

COACH WINTERS

(a little edgy)

Stop wastin' my time talkin' to you

guys for a start.

WILSON (V.O.)

I'm not gonna lead you into the fog

here, Sam...

CHANCELLOR WILSON

I'm concerned about our Program.

It's always been a source of pride

to our students and alumni, but two

straight so-so seasons are having a

damaging effect on our fund-raising,

both public and private.

WINTERS

(half-joking)

Then stop raising the entrance

requirements on me. We never could

have gotten Alvin Mack in here under

the new guidelines.

CHANCELLOR WILSON

As Chancellor, my first responsibility

is to the academic interests of this

University.

WILSON

At a time when we're committed to a

400 million dollar building program,

alumni donations are down 15% the

last two years. Because they've also

voiced their displeasure to their

legislators, we can expect a

corresponding drop in state funds.

HOWARD

The Athletic Fund is suffering too.

Season tickets sales are off,

merchandising's slow...

WINTERS

You layin' all this at my door?

There's been a recession on.

CHANCELLOR WILSON

Yes, but the heaviest drop has been

from the big donors, the 100,000

dollar club. These people are

recession proof. They sit in my box

every game, and they're much more

generous when we're ranked and going

to bowl games. Two of them, as you

know, are on the Board of Regents,

including the Chairman.

WINTERS

What are you trying to say to me,

Grant? After 12 years, my job's in

jeopardy?

CHANCELLOR WILSON

I'm not prepared to discuss your job

right now; I just want you to be

aware of the situation. The alumni

and the legislature are unhappy and

they vote with their checkbooks. I

don't pretend to be an expert on

football, Sam, and I'll deny that

this conversation ever took place,

but I do know we need to win next

year.

CLAYTON

(ignoring the effigy)

Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary

and player profiles are in your

briefcase. We got a 9:00am tomorrow

in Philly with this kid Darnell

Jefferson.

WINTERS

Looks like I've lost weight.

CLAYTON

This kid's the gamebreaker we've

been lookin' for.

COACH CLAYTON (V.O.)

Had a 108 yard kickoff return against

Taft. Michigan's been down to see

him twice.

WINTERS

Darnell, you have the potential to

start for us as a freshman. That 108

yard kickoff return you made against

Taft? One of the greatest runs I've

ever seen a high school player make.

Now, Michigan is set at tailback for

two years. You won't play till you're

a junior. With Joe here gettin' you

the ball, runnin' 28 Thunder right,

you'll be All-American with us as a

Sophomore.

REVEREND WALLACE

Yes, but I'm really more concerned

with Darnell's education. He came

here late. He's got some catching up

to do.

WINTERS

Believe me, education is the first

priority in our program. That's why

all the players are smarter than me.

After all, a football coach is smart

enough to understand the game, but

dumb enough to think it's important.

ALVIN'S MOTHER

It's real pretty, Alvin.

ALVIN

When I turn pro, I'll get you the

house to go with it.

LOUANNE

(lying)

It's real nice, Dad.

WINTERS

I knew you'de like it, Lou. Merry

Christmas. Put some fresh flowers on

your Mom's grave for me. I'll be

home in a couple days.

FRANK

Have another Vitamin I, Joey. Didn't

think we'de see you here this

Christmas, little brother.

JOE

You won't next year.

JOE'S FATHER

(getting up)

Yeh, well we won't rent your place

on the couch.

DARNELL

You're from E.S.U?

GIRL'S VOICE

Yeh. I was just sittin' here by the

fire doin' my homework, and decided

to give you a call. See how you're

doin'.

AUTUMN

Coach Winters has been telling me

about you. I'm looking forward to

seeing you when you come to visit.

I'll be your guide. You are coming

to visit aren't you?

P.A. ANNOUNCER

Now for the starting line-up for the

E.S.U. Timber Wolves. At tailback,

number 20, Darnell Jefferson!!

DARNELL

You got that right.

DARNELL

Thanks for showin' me around, Autumn.

I don't meet too many females like

you. You got a lotta class. Real

efficacious. Maybe I'll check you

out in the fall.

AUTUMN

I hope so, Darnell.

AUTUMN

Good night.

DARNELL

Now you know where I'm going and

what we're indubitably going to be.

JOE

Hey, Darnell, Welcome to E.S.U.

DARNELL

(shaking hands)

Yeh, good to see you guys. What

happened to the band and the dancin'

honies?

JOE

Regular students don't come back for

two weeks yet. Not that they woulda

been here. Now that you've enrolled,

you're just another wormshit freshman.

JOE

Here's your room. If you need anything

call the hall manager.

JOE

See ya later. Freshman Placement

test tomorrow at nine. McKinnley

Hall.

BOBBY

Uh, oh, the Lead Dog is back. There

goes my cover of the media guide.

JOE

Hey, Bobby, Lats, how ya doin? This

is Darnell Jefferson, freshman

tailback.

DARNELL

How ya' doin'?

BOBBY

I was hopin' you'de have rolled your

bike or somethin'. Nothin' serious,

just enough to keep you out for the

season.

JOE

(pouring himself some

beer)

No such luck, Backup Man. But I'll

try to engineer a few blowouts. Get

you get some mop-up time.

(studying Lattimer)

Shit, Lats, you look buffed, man.

You put on some weight?

LATTIMER

35 lbs. Spent the summer in the gym.

I'm tired of watchin' you guys play.

I intend to start this year.

BUD

You get any bigger, you can play

offense.

LATTIMER

Yeh, but don't I have to get dumber

too?

BUD

You still seein' Louanne?

BOBBY

Yeh. Now and then, when the tide

rises. Don't want her to think this

is some kind've exclusive deal.

JOE

Coach finds out you're nailin' his

daughter, you'll be playin' dorm

ball.

BOBBY

I'll bail before that. Besides, this

is what he gets for not startin' me.

ALVIN

Hey, man, you seen this?

ALVIN

(ribbing Joe)

You must be some very bad-ass

motherfucker.

JOE

Jesus...

LATTIMER

What? You didn't know?

JOE

I knew there was gonna be an article.

I didn't know it was gonna be on the

cover.

ALVIN

Shit, we do all the work. You get

all the pub. Too bad we're not allowed

to hit you in practice. Be fun to

kick the shit out of a Heisman Trophy

Candidate.

JOE

I guess you'll have to wait till we

get to the pros.

ALVIN

(to Darnell)

Beer boy, get me some.

DARNELL

Are you serious?

ALVIN

Does it look like I'm serious?

LATTIMER

Listen to this. "E.S.U. has a solid

nucleus returning, but the

Timberwolves, coming off two

disappointing seasons, will only go

as far as the strong right arm of

Heisman Candidate Joe Kane will take

them." That right, Joe? You gonna

lead us to the promised land?

JOE

I'm gonna lead... but can you follow?

BUD

What are we doin', Joe?

JOE

(slightly slurred)

There's something I wanta try. Gotta

wake up our Mojo. Start settin' the

tone for the season.

BUD

This is not a good time to be settin'

anything. You're in no shape...

BUD

Joe, c'mon Joe, don't be an asshole.

Joe! God-damnit, why's he always

doin' shit like this? Coach'll fuckin'

kill me. Alvin, go get him, will ya?

ALVIN

Hell no, you go get his ass. Crazy

motherfucker.

BUD

Fuck this shit.

BUD

C'mon, Joe, that's enough. Let's get

the hell outa here. What if somebody

drifts or crosses the line to pass?

JOE

What's the matter, Bud? Can't you

follow?

BUD

(torn)

God-damnit, god-damnit. Shit.

ALVIN

Startin' to look like a loaf of Wonder

bread out there.

BOBBY

They're makin' us look like pussies,

ya know. Standin' here suckin' our

thumbs.

LATTIMER

(to Alvin)

Yeh, and there's nobody from the

Defense out there.

ALVIN

What are you lookin' at? You think

you're bad?

LOUANNE

(vaguely sexual)

Bobby, be careful, o.k? Please, be

careful.

DARNELL

This guy do this kinda shit a lot?

They never mentioned this in

recruiting.

DISSOLVE TO:

DARNELL

I don't know... I left a lot of 'em

blank.

JOE

Don't worry, you'll do all right.

Lotta people don't finish.

DARNELL

(not convinced)

Yeh.

JOE

What are you doin' with the trophy?

DARNELL

Coach Winters asked me to bring it

to the meeting. I don't know what

for.

DARNELL

I'll see ya at the meeting.

(handing him the trophy)

Take this for me, will ya?

DARNELL

Hey, Autumn, hold up! What're you

doing here? I thought students didn't

come back for two weeks.

AUTUMN

(rather coolly)

I came back early to see a friend.

DARNEL

You're looking fresh, Autumn. A

package of pulchritudiness. What

about getting together later tonight?

Maybe get a pizza? They got pizza in

this town don't they?

AUTUMN

I can't tonight.

DARNELL

How about tomorrow night?

AUTUMN

I don't think it's a real good idea

for us to see each other, Darnell.

DARNELL

What's the matter? I'm not good enough

for you all of a sudden? Too young,

is that it? I'm not, ya know. They

held me back a year.

AUTUMN

No, it's not that... I've got a

boyfriend.

DARNELL

Did you have this boyfriend when you

showed me around?

AUTUMN

(reluctant to admit

it)

Yes.

DARNELL

Yeah, well, it didn't seem to bother

you then. I'm willing to overlook it

now.

AUTUMN

I was mad at him.

DARNELL

For what?

AUTUMN

I caught him with another girl. A

white girl.

DARNELL

And you're still with this nigger?

AUTUMN

Look, I got to get going, Darnell.

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lead you

on. I'm glad you came here.

DARNELL

Wait a minute. I can at least walk

with you, can't I? Nothin' wrong

with that.

AUTUMN

I'm in a hurry.

DARNELL

I can keep up. I run the forty in

four-four.

RAY

Hey, Autumn --

AUTUMN

Hi, Ray. This is...

DARNELL

(cutting in, offering

his hand)

Darnell Jefferson.

(pointedly)

Tailback.

RAY

(shaking Darnell's

hand)

Ray Griffen.

(just as pointedly)

Starting tailback.

DARNELL

I know. That's why they recruited

me.

RAY

The two guys they recruited before

you are handing out Gatorade now.

(making the jerkoff

motion)

Better start strengthening your wrist.

DARNELL

We'll see.

(departing, to Ray)

Give my best to Miss Lilly.

RAY

(to himself)

What the hell is that supposed to

mean?

WINTERS

Good to see you again, gentlemen.

(catching sight of

Darnell)

Jefferson, either take off the earring

or put on a dress.

WINTERS

I wanna talk a little about what

we're trying to do here. There are

many highly respected people who

feel football is about preparation

for life.

WINTERS

These people are full of shit. You

see, football is not like life.

(pause)

It's better. More exciting, more

intense, more fun. In life, people

are always wondering how they measure

up; whether they're getting ahead or

fallin' behind. In football, you

know. Every week you get a chance to

show what you're made of, a chance

to demonstrate the physical and

personal qualities that all those

poor bastards who can't play this

game are left to agonize about.

WINTERS

Last year we didn't make enough of

those chances. Last year everyone

felt we let the school down. Fuck

the school. We let ourselves down.

(pointing to the Wall

of Honor)

We let down a great tradition, a 120-

year-old Line of Champions.

WINTERS

Any football program worth the name

is a special brotherhood, an elite

corps of warriors, a select group of

knights. That first time our starting

unit takes the field, the first time

we huddle up; that's our inner circle,

that's our Round Table. If I were an

upperclassman, I'd be real nervous

about my seat, cause we got some

very talented new-comers this year.

Guys who want a place at the Table.

(producing Darnell's

trophy from behind

the podium)

This is the trophy one of our

freshman, Darnell Jefferson, won as

a Pennsylvania State High School

First Team All-American. You know

what this says to me?

WINTERS

Not a god-damn thing.

WINTERS

(to the freshmen)

Everybody here was a high school All-

American.

(to all the players)

Whatever any of you have done before

is out the window. We're startin'

over. Ground zero. The Table is empty.

Are you ready?

SMASH CUT TO:

COACH CLAYTON

(to Winters)

He's too pumped up. Tryin' to win

the damn Heisman on every throw. I'm

not sure he's ready for all this

hype.

COACH HUMES

Little late to be worryin' about

that. If we don't follow up the Sports

Illustrated cover with something,

it'll look like we didn't believe in

our own player.

WINTERS

Don't worry, Joe's a tough kid. He'll

be allright.

GRIFFEN

Hey, nice writhing, Jefferson. You

got all the moves.

WINTERS

(shouting to the team)

Allright, move it up. Let's go, 15

yards, run the next play.

WINTERS

Cut the necktie tackle horseshit.

You think you're in some kinda

highlight reel? He left you huggin'

air. Target his guts. Drive right

through his abdomen. I wanta see

snot bubbles in his nose. I wanta

see shit in his underwear.

WINTERS

You injured, Jefferson, or just hurt?

DARNELL

(gasping)

What do you mean?

WINTERS

If you're hurt, you can still play.

If you're injured you can't. Are you

hurt or are you injured?

DARNELL

I think I'm just hurt.

WINTERS

O.k., then get up.

WINTERS

Nice run. Think what it coulda done

for us if we still had the ball.

(handing him the ball)

This is a football. I want you to

carry it with you wherever you go.

Never let it out of your sight.

(to the rest of the

team)

Any of you see him on campus, take a

swipe at the ball. Try to knock it

out of his hands. Recover it.

(to Darnell again)

If anybody, but you, returns this

ball to me, you'll wish you'de never

been born.

WINTERS (V.O.)

This isn't gonna get it, goddamnit.

WINTERS

I see tackling, but I don't see

hitting. I see effort, but I don't

see ferocity. What do you think,

they're gonna motivate themselves?

Football's just a game to most of

these kids. This is our program, our

livelihood. It's our job to make

them care as much about it as we do.

Make them hate me if you have to.

It'll bring them together, give them

a focus. So get off your butts and

put the fear of God in these guys.

CLAYTON

Shit, Lattimer's an animal all of a

sudden. Benchin' 450. He's gotta be

on somethin'.

HUMES

What, steroids? Why do you always

think my guys are juicin'?

CLAYTON

I don't know... he's on the punt

team for three years, then gains 35

pounds of rip in one summer and an

attitude to go with it.

WINTERS

We're not doctors, gentlemen. The

NCAA has testing programs for this.

Let's let them worry about it.

(to Clayton)

Besides, it's not that hard to put

on 35 pounds in a summer, if you

really hit the gym.

BUD

What you got tonight?

CAFETERIA WORKER

Choice of three entrees. Shrimp,

lasagna, T-bone steak.

BUD

Tough choice. I'll take all three.

CAFETERIA WORKER

What a surprise.

DARNELL

When do they give ya the scores on

that Placement Test?

LATTIMER

Who cares? I flunked it three times,

before I got in.

ALVIN

Long as you're in the program, they'll

get you through. Maybe not with a

degree, but they'll keep you eligible.

Just don't do nothin' embarrassing

they can't cover you for.

LATTIMER

Hell, they even give Alvin copies of

his tests in advance. He sells 'em

for a hundred bucks a pop to people

in his class. 'Course he's gotta

have somebody read 'em to him.

ALVIN

Fuck you, doughboy. I can read. See

that shoe?

(points to his shoes)

That says Nike.

DARNELL

I still don't wanna flunk that test.

I wanta get a degree.

ALVIN

What do you think, nigger? You're

gonna be on the Supreme Court? All

you need to know is how to sign an

N.F.L. contract.

WINTERS

What's the matter with you guys?

You're supposed to be a team. Winning

depends on thinking and acting and

going to war together. But you don't

even eat like a team. You eat like

two teams. A white one and a black

one. What do I have to do? Make out

a seating chart? Now get up. Move

around. Mix it up. Now!

DARNELL

(mock introduction)

Hi there. Darnell Jefferson. I'm a

young black man.

JOE

Hey, glad to meet ya. Joe Kane,

Caucasian. So what doya think a that

new Garth Brooks album?

DARNELL

I love that motherfucker.

WINTERS

That's more like it.

JOE

How ya' doin'?

CAMILLE

Fine.

JOE

Little late to be workin' out, isn't

it?

CAMILLE

(with a little edge)

Only time I could get in here when

the football team wasn't usin' it.

JOE

(trying to get a rise

out of her)

Well, if it wasn't for the football

team, might not be a weight room to

use. You tryin' to firm up a little,

or what?

CAMILLE

(unfazed)

Don't need to firm up. I'm

strengthening my knee. Had

arthroscopic surgery.

JOE

Had my knee scoped once too. When

you're finished here, maybe we could

get a yogurt, compare scars.

CAMILLE

Sorry, I don't date football players.

They're all full of themselves. I

saw you on the cover of Sports

Illustrated, so you're probably worse

than most.

JOE

That's real open minded of you. So

you won't consider doin' anything

with me?

CAMILLE

No.

JOE

Well at least tell me what happened

to your knee. What'd you do? Fall

outa your convertible?

CAMILLE

You know, there's maybe one thing

I'd do with you.

JOE

What's that?

CAMILLE

Tennis. I'll play tennis with you.

JOE

Tennis. You mean now? It's raining.

SMASH CUT TO:

CAMILLE

Thanks for the game, Heisman. You

took it really well.

JOE

What's this Heisman crap?

JOE

I didn't say anything about being a

Heisman candidate. I don't go around

strokin' myself about it. So what's

this shit you're givin' me?

CAMILLE

I... I'm sorry... I just figured you

were probably kissin' yourself in

the mirror every morning.

JOE

You figured wrong.

CAMILLE

So what do you want, an apology? I

just gave you one.

JOE

I want a rematch.

CAMILLE

A rematch?

JOE

Some other sport. I took my beating.

You owe me one. Either that or we go

out.

CAMILLE

I'll think about it.

BOBBY

Real good date, Joe. Remind me to

take her out.

FADE OUT:

ADVISOR SMITH

Darnell, I've reviewed your placement

test and I'm afraid you failed to

meet our entrance requirements in

two areas.

DARNELL

What does that mean? I can't play

football?

ADVISOR SMITH

No. It means you're going to have to

take some remedial classes, what we

call "zero level" courses.

Specifically Math 0 and English 0.

ADVISOR SMITH

You won't get college credit for

them, but they will help you prepare

to take the Placement Test again at

the end of the quarter. If you pass

at that time you'll be able to

officially enter the university and

take college level courses. You'll

still be able to take an American

History survey course, but it won't

count on your record until you pass

the Placement Test. But first things

first. To start, I'm approving a

tutor for you.

DARNELL

A tutor? I don't need no tutor.

ADVISOR SMITH

Any tutor. And yes you do.

HOWARD

I think both Joe and the university

are best served by a straightforward

Heisman campaign. Nothing too

gimmicky.

BRAVER

We've compiled a mailing list of

around 1300 opinion makers;

newspapers, football writers, and

sports anchors. First we send them a

packet on Joe and his achievements.

Bio, stats, plus human interest stuff;

commitment to academics, charity

work, etc. Then we update it each

week with a postcard. Heisman voters

hate opening envelopes.

JOE

I haven't really done any charity

work...

BRAVER

You're gonna start. We've got some

things lined up.

NICHOLS

Unfortunately, because we weren't in

the top 20 last year, we only have

one network T.V. game to give Joe

national exposure. Although it's a

good one; Michigan. But we'll also

be taping all our other games and

buying satellite time. That way we

can produce our own highlight package

and interview pieces and send them

out to T.V. stations all over the

country for their sportscasts.

WINTERS

Any questions, Joe?

JOE

Ah, no... I just... you really think

I got a shot to win this?

WINTERS

Hell, yes. Plus it's a good thing

for the program. Publicizes the

school, gives a boost to recruiting,

and it's a great thing for you. Jumps

up your draft position, the size of

your first contract, everything.

It's a hell of an opportunity.

NICHOLS

All you gotta do is back it up on

the field, and we have no doubts

about that, cause we know "Kane is

Able."

CAMILLE

Hello...

JOE

This is Joe Kane. What did you decide?

CAMILLE

(still drowsy)

What?

(looking at the clock)

It's 3:00 in the morning.

JOE

I wanta know what you decided.

CAMILLE

I don't know... I couldn't think of

any other sports I could beat you

at.

JOE

Then I'll pick you up tonight at

6:00.

CAMILLE

What?

DARNELL

Hey, Autumn.

AUTUMN

Hi, Darnell. What are you doin here?

DARNELL

My advisor says I need a tutor. Ya

know, just to get me over a couple

rough spots.

(showing her a paper)

I saw your name on this list. I

figured if you couldn't keep my

attention, nobody could.

AUTUMN

I'm sorry, Darnell, but I've already

been assigned. You're gonna have to

find somebody else. I'm tutoring

Scott Sherman.

DARNELL

Not anymore. I asked Coach Winters

to switch us.

AUTUMN

Coach Winters wouldn't do that.

DARNELL

Yeh he would. I'm a bigger prospect

than Sherman.

(pointing across the

way)

He's a lineman on the scout team.

DARNELL

C'mon Autumn, you could teach me

some real erudition.

AUTUMN

(trying to whisper,

pissed)

Will you stop using those big words.

It sounds ridiculous.

DARNELL

(serious about this)

What doya mean? I'm improvin' myself.

I learn a new word out of the

dictionary every day. Mendacious,

pejorative, antithetical,

commensurate...

AUTUMN

And you don't ever use them right.

Pretending to be smart is not the

same as being educated. Or erudite.

It's just a con. And it makes you

sound stupid, no matter how big a

prospect you are.

DARNELL

O.K... even more reason for you to

be my tutor. You already taught me

something.

CAMILLE

We goin' on that?

JOE

Yeh. I thought we might take a ride.

CAMILLE

I promised my dad I'd never get on

one of those.

JOE

What are you, one of these trust-

fund princesses? It's fine for me to

play a game I don't know, but I ask

you to try somethin' different and

you hide behind your daddy.

CAMILLE

(snatching the helmet)

All right. But we go slow. No cowboy

stuff.

JOE

This speed, o.k.?

CAMILLE

Yeh, fine.

JOE

Good.

CAMILLE

Slow down, damnit. Joe... Joe!

CAMILLE

(freaked)

Joe, look out!!!

CUT TO:

CAMILLE

How could you do that, you stupid

punk? It isn't funny, god-dammit,

you coulda killed us! You're crazy,

you know that...

JOE

Take it easy. I've done that a hundred

times. No big deal.

CAMILLE

Oh, yeh? Then why are you shaking?

JOE

(embarrassed)

I don't know... I guess cause I've

never done it with someone else on

the bike.

CAMILLE

You just wanted to scare me. Are you

happy now?

JOE

Yeh, pretty much. And the scream was

even better than I thought it'd be.

Every dog within hearing distance

wants to mate with you now.

CAMILLE

You come here a lot?

JOE

Now and then. Why?

CAMILLE

It's not exactly a campus favorite.

This is almost like hidin' out.

JOE

I like places where nobody knows me.

This too low-rent for you?

CAMILLE

No, my dad owned a place like this.

JOE

Your dad? You mean he owned a chain

of these?

CAMILLE

Not everybody with a Southern accent

has their own plantation. My dad

could never afford to send me here.

I learned to play tennis on public

courts. Mighta been able to play pro

someday, if I hadn't hurt my knee.

JOE

So you're just a scholarship jock

like me.

CAMILLE

Yeh. You disappointed?

JOE

No, I've just never been out with a

jock before.

CAMILLE

Is that what we're doin' here? Goin'

out?

JOE

I don't know. What doya think?

CAMILLE

I think you're crazy for jeopardizing

your scholarship and a pro future by

jumping motorcycles off of highways.

JOE

Just tryin' to keep my edge, Camille.

The other guys look to me cause they

think I'll do anything. I lose that,

I'm just another guy, and we all get

our ass kicked.

CAMILLE

I don't know, Joe. You scare me.

WINTERS

The keys.

WINTERS

I told you, as long as you're in

this program, you don't take

unnecessary risks off the field. A

man in contention for the Heisman

Trophy should be able to remember

that.

AUTUMN

O.K., using the things we worked on

yesterday, I want you to write a two

or three page essay on some aspect

of your life. Something other than

football.

DARNELL

Like what?

AUTUMN

Your father, maybe. You could write

about your dad.

DARNELL

Don't know that much about him. He

was off in Detroit workin' in a car

plant when I was born. Got laid off,

tried to rob a jewelry store to get

us some money. He died in prison.

Some kinda heart problem.

AUTUMN

How about your mother?

DARNELL

She was always workin'. Usually two

jobs. Comin' home one night she

stopped to get us some root beer.

Got caught in a gang crossfire. Shot

three times... died on the way to

the hospital. You want me to write

about that?

AUTUMN

(blown away)

No...

DARNELL

Good, 'cause none of it's true.

AUTUMN

(raising her voice)

Jesus Christ, Darnell what a terrible

thing to do to somebody. That's not

funny. That's sick.

DARNELL

Had ya goin', didn't I?

AUTUMN

(soft library voice)

No you didn't. You just... How could

you make up somethin' like that?

DARNELL

(contrite now)

Sounded more interesting than the

truth. My mom took a vacation to

Chicago when I was 12. Never came

back. Don't know who my dad was.

AUTUMN

Who took care of you?

DARNELL

I started hangin' with the J.B.M.,

gang-bangin'... Did some time in the

Hall. Reverand Wallace saw me playin'

football on a juvenile probation

team. Took me in, got me into high

school. Only reason they accepted me

was 'cause I could play football.

Sorta like here. Football saved my

life. I'd be nowhere without football.

AUTUMN

Well, then... maybe you could write

about football this once.

DARNELL

Yeh, o.k... thanks.

(pause)

I've seen a lotta shitty things in

my life, Autumn. That's why I know

when I see somethin' good.

TUTOR

Let's review the chapter I read you

yesterday. Which two city states

fought in the Punic Wars?

ALVIN

I dunno. Detroit and Buffalo.

TUTOR

C'mon, Alvin. You're gonna be tested

on this.

WINTERS

Okay, Alvin, this is Mississippi

State's offensive set. 2nd and 2 on

our 24. What defense are you in?

ALVIN

Eagle. Zipper. Hero. Unless the set

back shifts into the I.

WINTERS

Good.

(slide changes)

How about here? 3rd and 7.

ALVIN

Okie. Thunder. Lion.

WINTERS

What's your assignment?

ALVIN

Kill the Quarterback.

(slide changes)

Hit the tight end so hard his

girlfriend dies.

(slide changes)

Kill everybody.

DARNELL

Sorry... I lost my football.

LATTIMER

Yes!! Starting defense. Place at the

table. Whooo!! Yes!!

WINTERS

N.C.A.A. is gonna test half the team

before the game Saturday. Make sure

Lattimer knows about it.

WINTERS

As the veteran players know, we have

Pride Night every year before our

opening game. It's a chance to get

to know each other better, share

some thoughts, and bring us closer

together as a team. So to start off,

I'd like each player to tell the

others in his group what he likes

best about football and then what

he's most proud of off the field.

I've asked some of the seniors to

lead it off. Gentlemen.

LATTIMER

I don't know... It's the battle. The

goin' to war with the other guys.

Hangin' together.

LATTIMER (V.O.)

Bein' different from everybody else.

Havin' our own dorm, stayin' in hotels

the night before games. Settin'

ourselves apart.

LATTIMER (V.O.)

Havin' a chance to be somebody. To

do somethin' that people look up to

you for. Your strength and your

courage. Not everybody can play

football. We're the lucky ones.

DARNELL

The thing I'm most proud of myself

for?

DARNELL (V.O.)

Just that I'm here. That I'm not

dead or in jail.

JOE

The great thing about football is

you can lose yourself in it.

JOE (V.O.)

There's no time to think, to worry,

to have doubts. Everything else fades

away. You just move and react.

ALVIN

The best thing is when you dominate.

That feeling when you hit a guy real

good, really stick him, and you hear

that little moan.

ALVIN (V.O.)

You know it's killin' him, but you

feel great. It's just him and you,

and he's the one that's hurtin'.

SMASH CUT TO:

HARVEY

Welcome everybody to the Wolf Den

where the E.S.U. Timberwolves, led

by Heisman candidate Joe Kane, open

their season against the tough

Mississippi State Bulldogs under

head coach Jackie Sherrill.

ALVIN

All right, let's get evil. 60 minutes,

balls out. Let's open a can of kick-

ass. Kill 'em all. Let the paramedics

sort 'em out.

ALVIN

Hey, 23, don't think I don't recognize

you, you little fuck.

ALVIN

Hey, pay attention when I'm talkin'

to you, nigger. You're the guy that

shot my mother aren't you?

TAILBACK

What?

ALVIN

You were tryin' to steal her fuckin'

car weren't you, cocksucker.

TAILBACK

Shut up. I never heard of your mother.

DARNELL

(to Joe)

What's Alvin saying to that guy?

JOE

Just gettin' himself pumped up.

DARNELL

He wasn't pumped up already?

ALVIN

(to tailback)

Thought I'd never find you didn't

ya? But I got you now nigger, and

I'm gonna kill you motherfucker. I'm

gonna bust your guts open and watch

you die.

WINTERS

Atta baby, Alvin, heads up. Big pop,

Steve, way to stick 'em.

(turning to Joe)

O.K. Joe, let's go up top. Take it

to 'em right away.

JOE

(in huddle)

O.K. let's put the women and children

to bed, and go lookin' for dinner.

Don't let em up. 51 Strike, Orange

left. On 4.

BUD LITE

Bali Hi, will call you, anytime, any

day. Here am I, your special island...

BLACK TACKLE

Shut up, snowflake. You think you're

in the school play?

BUD LITE

No, Bali Hi, the endzone is calling.

And the highway runs right over your

ass.

BLACK TACKLE

Bullshit, you're gonna be my bitch,

baby. You gonna be my punk bitch.

BUD LITE

(singing again)

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen,

good night, I hate to go and leave

this pretty sight.

FADE THROUGH TO:

WINTERS

Jefferson! In for Griffen.

HARVEY (V.O.)

2:05 left. Kane hands to Jefferson...

REFEREE

Excuse me, son, but we're gonna need

that football for another couple

minutes.

WINTERS

Guess we'll be on the payroll for

another week.

BUD LITE

Good game, man. Really enjoyed it.

BLACK TACKLE

Yeh, you're a strong motherfucker.

Shitty singer though.

ALUMNUS

Good to see ya in there, Darnell.

Way to hold on to that pigskin.

DARNELL

Hey, some guy just gave me a 50 dollar

bill.

ALVIN

Don't worry, you'll get 5 or 6 hundred

once you're startin', depending on

how you play.

DARNELL

But we're not supposed to get any

are we?

ALVIN

Hey, man, you can't live on $500 a

month scholarship money. And the NC

double assholes won't let us have

jobs, so you take your money where

you can get it.

(taking Darnell's

envelope)

I'll keep it for you, till you see

the light. Shit, they oughta be payin'

us anyway. Athletic Department gets

3 million just for goin' to a bowl

game.

REPORTER (V.O.)

This performance today -- two

touchdown passes, another you ran

in. Where do you think this puts you

in the Heisman race?

JOE

(uncomfortable)

I really have no idea. That's up to

you guys.

BERMAN

Now let's turn to our Heisman watch.

(does the pose while

remaining seated)

We begin with Sports Illustrated

cover boy Joe Kane of E.S.U. who led

his team to an impressive victory

this afternoon. Well, if Joe continues

to raise Kane, he may well be Able

to dust off a large space on his

trophy shelf. Although the real test

will come in four weeks against

Michigan and their Heisman hopeful,

Tim Waymen.

BERMAN (V.O.)

Michigan also won big today. Timothy,

"He Could Go All The Way Men", will

be looking to do so against the

Timberwolves. And of course the able

Kane will be looking to also. I can't

wait.

BUD LITE

I don't know, I never seem to make

out at things like this.

BOBBY

You don't make out anywhere. Or did

you finally break the snatch barrier

this summer?

BUD LITE

Fuck you, Bobby.

(realizing Louanne's

there)

Excuse me, Louanne.

ALVIN

Forget it, nigger. No chance for you

there.

DARNELL

Why not?

ALVIN

Griffin's goin' to medical school.

She likes that light-skinned

respectable shit. You're just her

ghetto toy.

DARNELL

(to Autumn)

Can I have this one?

RAY

I don't think so.

DARNELL

What are you so worried about? You

haven't lost your starting job yet.

AUTUMN

(turning to Ray)

Just one.

AUTUMN

(whispering)

Take it easy, Darnell. This isn't a

good time to push things. You're

putting me in an awkward position.

DARNELL

Yeh, well, I got a little

encouragement along the way.

AUTUMN

That kiss... it was just... a kiss.

DARNELL

Bullshit. You meant it. I wouldn't

be standing here now, everybody

thinkin' I'm a stupid asshole, if I

didn't know you meant it. I wanna

see you, Autumn. Not in study hall.

Not like your student. Like somebody

to be taken seriously.

AUTUMN

I do take you seriously, Darnell,

but I'm still with Ray. I can't just

go paradin' around town.

DARNELL

I don't need to go paradin'. We'll

go someplace different. Someplace

nobody'll see us.

AUTUMN

God, why am I even considering this?

RAY

(to Darnell)

All caught up on your arithmetic?

DARNELL

Yeh, you only gained 37 yards on 12

carries.

JOE

(to Bud Lite)

Just what we need, a little team

unity.

RAY

I'm gettin' a little sick of this

asshole, Autumn. I don't like you

hangin' out with him. It's

embarrassing.

AUTUMN

I don't hang out with him. I tutor

him.

RAY

Then have him get another tutor.

AUTUMN

I can't do that. I made a commitment

to help him pass his qualifying exam.

I can't bail out on him now.

RAY

What the hell difference does it

makes? They'll grease him through no

matter what he does. Nobody's ever

gonna see his graduation. Don't tell

me you're falling for this guy. He's

just another gang-banger with speed.

AUTUMN

I just said I wanted to help him.

What are you more afraid of, losing

your girl or your position?

RAY

Maybe you oughta think about what

you're in danger of losing.

AUTUMN

Maybe I will.

VOICE (V.O.)

So where you wanna go?

JOE

Maybe she's out with some guy.

BUD

Who? Camille? I don't think she's

the type to screw around on ya. Shoot

ya, maybe...

JOE

It wouldn't be screwing around. It's

not like we're going together.

AUTUMN

You're right, nobody would ever see

us here.

DARNELL

Yes, I figure the key is to go places

only white people go. Next time we'll

go bowling.

DARNELL

Plus I saw this in Rocky. I never

believed a guy who was supposed to

be an athlete would skate that bad,

but now I know.

AUTUMN

Thanks, that was fun, sort of.

DARNELL

You were pretty good for the first

time.

AUTUMN

Well, it's not really my first time.

My dad took me skating once.

DARNELL

He used to play ball for E.S.U.,

didn't he?

AUTUMN

Yeah, how'd you know that?

DARNELL

I saw his picture on the Wall of

Fame. You got his eyes. Luckily, you

didn't get his thighs.

DARNELL

Make sure you mean it this time.

JOE

What are you doin' here?

CAMILLE

Couldn't sleep.

JOE

I was just sweatin' out some of the

beer.

JOE

I didn't go home with her. I thought

about it... but I didn't.

CAMILLE

You drink too much.

JOE

Yeh.

CAMILLE

Why didn't you?

JOE

Why didn't I what?

CAMILLE

Go home with her?

JOE

I don't know... I guess I figured

maybe there was somethin' goin' on

between you and me.

CAMILLE

Then why'd you pick her up in the

first place?

JOE

I was drunk... I needed some company.

CAMILLE

(angry)

Company? Yeh, I can see you havin' a

real far-ranging discussion with

Sheri.

JOE

I mean, ya know, physical company...

I was... I just needed to pounce on

somebody I guess.

CAMILLE

Why can't you pounce on me? Aren't I

good enough to pounce on?

JOE

Well, you're more conservative...

classier... you're not that kinda

girl...

CAMILLE

(insulted)

How do you know? You've never slept

with me.

CAMILLE

What makes you think she's such a

great ride?

(climbing up on top

of him)

I'm prettier, my legs are longer...

(pulling down her

leotard)

I've got better tits.

(exasperated)

Why would you go to her, when you

have me?

JOE

I didn't know I had you.

CAMILLE

(softer, leaning close)

Well you do.

CAMILLE

(between kisses)

You shoulda looked for me at the

library, or don't you ever go there?

JOE

(rolling back on top)

I go there. I got a 3.2 in Political

Science. I just don't go there on

Saturday nights.

CAMILLE

(rolling back on top

again)

I have a paper due Monday. What'de

she do? Sit on your lap or just give

you the nail-me stare?

JOE

Shut up, Camille.

T.A.

What's your name?

LOUANNE

Bobby Collins.

T.A.

Can I see your I.D.?

CLAYTON

Coach, we, ah... got a problem with

Bobby Collins.

WINTERS

Yeh...

CLAYTON

He talked... a friend... into taking

a test for him and got caught. They

had a new T.A. in there...

WINTERS

What's the penalty?

CLAYTON

Well, the rules say automatic

expulsion for both of them.

WINTERS

Fortunately, we've got friends on

the Board of Regents. I think we can

beat this if we really go to bat for

him. We got Mack off when he turned

in that other guys term paper.

(shaking his head)

But what kinda idiot would do

something like that?

CLAYTON

Well, I guess Bobby figured he was

gonna flunk...

WINTERS

I don't mean Bobby. I mean what kinda

guy would be dumb enough to take a

test for him?

CLAYTON

Uh, well... it wasn't a guy.

WINTERS

A girl? Typical Collins. He must

have banged her until she couldn't

think straight. Who was it?

CLAYTON

(barely able to get

it out)

It was... Louanne.

WINTERS

Jesus, Louanne, how could you be so

stupid?

LOUANNE

I... he was behind, he needed help.

I'm sorry. I just...

WINTERS

Sorry! You're sorry! You've destroyed

my credibility at the University, my

authority with the players... Christ,

it looks like I'm running a dirty

program. And Collins of all people!

What the hell's the matter with you,

Louanne?

LOUANNE

(crying)

I don't know... I thought he... loved

me...

WINTERS

Loved you? He loves anything that

winks back, the little rat bastard.

And what are you gonna do for school

now? I use my influence to get you

back in, it'll stink to high hell.

The press'll crucify me.

LOUANNE

I'll get in someplace.

WINTERS

God, Louanne, I told you to stay

away from my players. That was my

cardinal rule, stay away from the

damn players...

LOUANNE

They've always been good enough for

you. Good enough to devote your life

to. Why aren't they good enough for

me? Or are they too good?

WINTERS

You're changing the subject, Louanne.

We're talkin' about you breakin' the

rules.

LOUANNE

Didn't you ever break the rules just

a little? Didn't you tell me once

that 90 per cent of the schools obey

the NCAA rules, and the other 10 per

cent go to bowl games? Was that just

a joke?

AUTUMN

You seen this? You got a D on your

math test.

DARNELL

Yeh, I kinda figured that. I had

some trouble on this last part...

AUTUMN

We went over that last week, Darnell.

What is this time we spend in here?

Just a joke to you? I don't even

think you've been listening to me.

DARNELL

I've been listening to you, baby...

AUTUMN

Don't call me baby. I thought you

wanted to learn. But if all you wanta

do is fake your way through, then

get another tutor to waste time with.

DARNELL

C'mon, Autumn, we just had a good

time, and now you're gettin' all

nuts behind this. It's just one test.

AUTUMN

So far, it's the only test. I want

you to study this whole chapter. By

yourself, without me here. When I

come back, we'll discuss it. Be ready

to do problems based on it.

DARNELL

Whatever you say, Teach.

(big grin)

I don't wish to be cast in a

pejorative light, so I'm dedicating

myself to achieving on a level more

commensurate with my abilities.

BUD LITE

Coach'd probably shoot ya lower.

WINTERS

You all played a fine game on

Saturday. Take the day off.

WINTERS

C'mon in, Collins.

BOBBY

Listen, Coach, I just want you to

know I'm really sorry about this

whole thing with Louanne. I was real

glad to hear she's gonna be goin' to

junior college here...

WINTERS

(cutting him off)

Shut up.

WINTERS

I could easily take your case to the

Board of Regents. You've had no prior

infractions and I could argue that

you were under abnormal pressure.

(pause)

But I won't. You embarrassed me, you

embarrassed my family, you embarrassed

the program. As of now, you are no

longer a member of this university

or it's football team. Clean out

your locker.

SWANN

(to his cameraman)

We ready, Jerry? O.K., let's mark

it.

SWANN

Joe, this game is being billed as a

potential "Heisman Shootout". Did

you feel any added pressure this

week...

SWANN (V.O.)

...knowing that you're going head to

head with Heisman rival, Tim Waymen?

JOE

Well, ya know, you try to block it

out, but it's basically impossible...

Everybody seems to be talkin' about

it, all the newspapers, the

interviews...

JOE (V.O.)

The hype on T.V., tryin' to get

somethin' goin...

BRAVER

Hold it! Hold it!

SWANN

What?! What's the problem?

BRAVER

What you're saying is true, of course,

but I don't think it's the message

you want to send.

BRAVER (V.O.)

It makes you seem a little nervous.

Like the pressure might be getting

to you.

BRAVER

This game is nationally televised,

so most Heisman voters will be

watching. I think a more casual

approach is better. Modest,

controlled, casual.

SWANN

(to Braver, irritated)

We all set now?

(gets a nod)

Let's mark it.

(the take is marked)

Joe, this game is being billed as a

potential "Heisman Shootout."

SWANN (V.O.)

Did you feel any added pressure this

week, knowing that you're going head

to head with Heisman rival, Tim

Waymen?

JOE

No, I don't really think too much

about that kinda thing.

CAMILLE

Your parents comin' to the game

tomorrow?

JOE

My mom's dead. My dad has never seen

me play.

CAMILLE

Why not?

JOE

Guess he's not that interested in

football.

CAMILLE

But you're one of the best players

in the country.

JOE

(snapping)

He's just not into it, o.k.?

CAMILLE

(chastised)

O.k.

(silence)

What's goin' on, Joe? You ask me out

here, like you wanta talk about

somethin', then you don't say

anything. You worried about tomorrow?

JOE

No... I'm worried about the days

after that. I just. I don't know...

I feel like tomorrow's gonna be my

last game. I want to stay up, make

the time go slow.

CAMILLE

Why would it be your last game? You

afraid of getting hurt?

JOE

No, that'd be a relief. Then, at

least, I wouldn't be a failure.

CAMILLE

Joe, why are you thinking like this?

Why would you be a failure? You're

having a great year, you're a Heisman

Trophy candidate, you got millions

of dollars waiting for you in the

pros.

JOE

(testy)

How do you know what's waiting for

me? You don't know me at all.

CAMILLE

(hurt)

I don't know you? How can you say

that?

JOE

Because you wouldn't be here now if

you did. You only know the guy that's

supposed to make millions in the

pros.

CAMILLE

Is that what you think? That I'm

with you for the money?

JOE

Why else?

CAMILLE

Fuck you, Joe.

(starting to cry)

I don't give a shit about your money.

I don't even give a shit about

football. And you know what? Maybe

you're right, maybe I don't know

you.

CAMILLE

Joe! Joe! My god, Joe, what are you

doing? No! No!

CAMILLE

God Joe, oh god, are you allright?

JOE

(drained)

Yeh, just got some dirt in my teeth.

Guess you've really seen the dark

side now, huh? You should've gotten

out while you had the chance. Before

it all goes to hell.

CAMILLE

I don't wanta get out, damnit. What's

wrong Joe? Why would it all go to

hell?

JOE

I'm a Kane, Camille. That's all it

takes. We're cut out to be drunks

and fuck-ups. We never live up to

expectations. It's in our blood. My

dad, brothers, uncles -- we all drink

and sooner or later we all fuck up.

My dad went the longest. Waited till

he was playin' triple A ball, before

he hit the wall. Sometimes I feel

like I'm just waiting for my turn.

The better I do, the closer it gets.

CAMILLE

You're not like them, you can beat

all that. You can stop drinking, you

can break the chain.

JOE

If I gave up that, I wouldn't be

much of a football player. And if I

wasn't a football player, what would

I be?

CAMILLE

You'de still be Joe. And I'd still

love you.

JOE

Just don't say I never warned you.

ZABRISKIE

4:29 to go and it's been a great

one. Two undefeated teams goin' after

each other. Michigan up by four, 24-

20, but the lead has changed hands

three times, and you get the feeling

that whoever has the ball last is

gonna win it.

SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)

Well, it was billed as a Heisman

shootout, and it's been all of that.

Both Waymen and Kane moving their

teams up and down the field, having

big days.

ZABRISKIE (V.O.)

Kane back to pass, can't find anybody,

gonna run it himself, ten, five, hit

at the goal-line... Touchdown E.S.U.!!

Great run by Kane!

SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)

He's still down. Looks like he's

hurt.

DOCTOR

How many fingers am I holding up?

JOE

Four.

ALVIN

Hey, powderpuff. You're the white

boy that ratted my brother out. Sent

him to jail, cocksucker. Ran off

with the fuckin' money. Left the

blood to do the time, huh?

ALVIN

Yeh, you're the little bastard.

Account of you, my bros' datin' his

cell mate. You hear me, powderpuff?

Gonna make you pay. You gonna be my

cellmate now. You gonna have 250

lbs. of pissed-off nigger up your

ass.

ZABRISKIE (V.O.)

E.S.U. in an eight-man line looking

for the run on third and short.

ZABRISKIE (V.O.)

Waymen fakes to Simms, Mack on the

blitz, Waymen is goin for it all!

Hit as he throws.

ZABRISKIE (V.O.)

Hunt has got a step. He's got it!

Touchdown!

SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)

Great clutch throw under pressure.

Can't do it much better than that.

DOCTOR

You're vision's back to normal.

WINTERS

You think you can go?

JOE

Yeh, I'm fine. Just a little headache.

(getting up, shouting

to his teamates)

O.K. Offense, let's get it back.

ALVIN

Damn tough to scare that little white

boy. Either his momma dropped him on

his head, or the motherfucker is

deaf.

WINTERS

Jefferson, in for Griffen.

ZABRISKIE (V.O.)

Ball on the Michigan 47, 1:02 to go,

Kane brings 'em to the line of

scrimmage.

ZABRISKIE (V.O.)

Great run by Jefferson, the highly-

touted Freshman, the longest of the

day for the Wolves. And this one is

turning out to be everything we

thought it would be.

JOE

O.K., time to put the women and

children to bed, and go looking for

dinner.

JOE

82 Strike, Eagle, Crown, on 2.

ZABRISKIE (V.O.)

Kane looking for Jefferson. It's...

Intercepted! Intercepted by Freeman!

And that should do it.

ZABRISKIE

Well, it was everything we expected

it to be. Fine performances on both

sides of the field.

ZABRISKIE (V.O.)

The edge in the much ballyhooed battle

of the quarterbacks would probably

have to go to Michigan's Tim Waymen

who threw for 2 touchdowns, and ran

for another. Joe Kane accounted for

three E.S.U. touchdowns, but had

that crucial interception in the

waning moments. And that proved to

be the difference.

DARNELL

Hey, Autumn.

AUTUMN

Hi, Darnell.

DARNELL

Is this your dad?

AUTUMN

Yes...

DARNELL

How do you do, Mr. Haley. I'm Darnell

Jefferson.

MR. HALEY

Jefferson? Nice run you made on that

screen pass. Another block and you

might have scored.

DARNELL

Thank you. We'll get 'em next year.

MR. HALEY

How do you and Autumn know each other?

You a friend of Ray's?

AUTUMN

(filling the void)

Ah, I tutor him...

MR. HALEY

Oh really? In what?

DARNELL

Math and English.

MR. HALEY

Ah.

MR. HALEY

Well, stay on top of that, Darnell.

I'd have been in real trouble if I

hadn't gotten my degree. I played

ball once. Hurt my knee.

DARNELL

Yeh, I know...

MR. HALEY

I used to put a copy of my report

card inside the webbing of my helmet

to remind me that college was more

important than football.

DARNELL

(forcing enthusiasm)

Good idea. Well, I gotta get goin'.

Nice to meet you Mr. Haley.

MR. HALEY

Nice to meet you, Darnell.

DARNELL

See you around, Autumn.

RAY

Hey, Mr. Haley. Good to see you.

MR. HALEY

Hey, Ray. You still havin' dinner

with us tonight?

BUD LITE

(to Alvin)

Anybody seen Joe?

ALVIN

Not yet. Probably out with Camille.

Haven't seen Darnell either.

LESLIE

I think we better get back downstairs.

LATTIMER

No, Leslie, we're just getting to

know each other.

LESLIE

(starting to get up)

No, I think...

LATTIMER

C'mon Leslie, you didn't come up

here to stop now.

LATTIMER

What were you doin'? Leadin' me on?

LATTIMER

(throwing Leslie on

the bed again)

Get outa here!

BUD

This is it, man. No more 'roids.

This shit has gotta stop.

WINTERS

Hello, yeh... What?!

CLAYTON

It looks like this will blow over.

The girl's father is a big booster,

contributed a lotta money. So he

said they won't go to the press.

WINTERS

He said that? The father?

CLAYTON

Yeh, he's not exactly happy about

all this, but he doesn't wanta hurt

the program.

WINTERS

We're still gonna have to suspend

Lattimer.

HUMES

What for? There aren't any charges.

Nobody outside the program knows

about this.

WINTERS

He's outa control, Lyle. We can't

ignore this anymore. I don't know

what pisses me off more -- that he's

juicin' or that he's doin' such a

shitty job of hidin' it.

HUMES

He's never tested positive. If we

suspend him without proof, he could

sue us for jeopardizing his draft

status, his pro career.

WINTERS

Yeh, but we can't sit and wait till

he kills somebody. I hate to lose

him as much as you do, but we gotta

clean him up before he does somethin'

that lands the whole program on

probation. Plus, we have to take

some action or the girl's dad is

gonna start havin' second thoughts.

I don't care how many checks he's

written.

CLAYTON

So what do we do?

WINTERS

Bring him down here.

LATTIMER

Three games? Why so many?

WINTERS

You oughta be grateful I didn't

suspend you for the whole year.

LATTIMER

What are you gonna give as the reason?

WINTERS

We'll say you've got a hamstring

pull.

LATTIMER

(relieved)

Thank you, Coach.

WINTERS

Don't thank me. During those three

weeks, you better kick the roids,

cause when you come back I'm gonna

personally test you before every

game. No N.C.A.A. shit either. I'm

gonna watch the piss go into the

bottle. You got that?

LATTIMER

(barely audible, shamed)

Yes, sir.

WINTERS

Start practicing your limp.

JOE

Coupla real college heroes, huh?

Tearin' up the town.

DARNELL

First time I ever lost a girl and a

game on the same day. Guess I never

really had the girl.

BOYFRIEND

You know that guy?

DEBBI

Not really...

BOYFRIEND

Then why you smilin' at him?

DEBBI

I don't know... he looks like that

E.S.U. quarterback guy. Joe, what's

his name?

BOYFRIEND

So what? So you go and smile at him?

BOYFRIEND

You been lookin' at my girlfriend?

JOE

(a little drunk himself)

I don't know. Which one is she?

BOYFRIEND

Wise guy, huh? Mr. bigtime

quarterback. The one who choked his

ass off today. You got nothin' better

to do then look at my girlfriend?

BOYFRIEND

Hey, Heisman, I'm talkin' to you.

You too good to talk to me?

JOE

I'm not even interested in talkin'

to you.

BOYFRIEND

You think you're a bad ass? You think

my girl's hot for you? Take your

pads off, you're just another pussy.

DARNELL

(grabbing him)

C'mon we gotta get outa here.

JOE

Oh shit...

WINTERS

What is it now?... Oh Jesus...

JOE

The guy went for me first. What was

I supposed to do?

WINTERS

Doesn't make any difference. It made

the papers, all the wire services.

The guy had to go to the hospital.

Worst of all they got you on drunk

driving. You had a blood alcohol

level .50 above the legal limit. We

can't smooth that over, Joe. It'd

look like we were sprayin' Pledge on

bird shit. We had to agree to send

you to Rehab.

JOE

Rehab? I'll be a god-damn joke. You

can't do this to me.

WINTERS

It was the only way we could get

them to drop the assault and D.W.I.

You go to trial on those, we lose

you for a year, and risk NCAA

investigation. C'mon, lotsa athletes

have been through Rehab.

JOE

Not in the middle of the season. Not

in the middle of a Heisman campaign.

WINTERS

You'll only miss four games. You'll

be back in time for the last one,

Georgia Tech, and a Bowl if we get

there. Plus, you've still got your

senior year.

JOE

Yeh, but what will I come back as?

What kinda player?

WINTERS

Don't worry, you'll still be the

Man. You'll still be the leader of

this team.

JOE

I'm sorry, Coach.

WINTERS

These things happen.

WINTERS

Fuckin' kids.

AUTUMN

Darnell, wait. C'mon Darnell, I wanta

talk to you.

AUTUMN

Where you been, I been callin' you?

DARNELL

Been busy.

AUTUMN

Darnell, I'm sorry about Saturday.

It was an awkward situation.

DARNELL

It wasn't awkward. It was educational.

I realized how you see me. I'm good

enough to tutor, to go places with,

but not to tell your father about.

AUTUMN

That's not it. It's just that my

father expects me to be with somebody

like Ray. He wouldn't understand us.

DARNELL

(stopping)

Why not?

AUTUMN

I don't know... he likes Ray cause...

DARNELL

He's a good student, he acts right...

he doesn't need football. He's class

and I'm not, right?

AUTUMN

I didn't say that.

DARNELL

You don't have to, Autumn. I'm

everything your dad used to be and

don't want you fallin' back into.

AUTUMN

Darnell...

DARNELL

You were right before, Autumn. I

should have another tutor. Thanks

for everything you did for me.

ALVIN (V.O.)

Four fuckin' weeks?

ALVIN

Shit, the defense is gonna have to

pitch shutouts now...

(to Lattimer)

and you're gone for 3. What the hell

did you take that shit for?

LATTIMER

Nobody seemed to mind when I was

knockin' people's dicks in the dirt.

ALVIN

I bust chops too. I don't have to

get all fucked up.

LATTIMER

Not everybody has the ability you

do, Alvin. You do what you have to

do to play.

ALVIN

Well, you're not playin' much now

are you? Shit, whole fuckin' season

down the drain.

HOWARD

I been talkin' to Chancellor Wilson...

WINTERS

What's he wanta do now, cut practice

down to once a week?

HOWARD

No, he's happy with the way the

season's gone so far. The Alumni

have pretty much stayed off his back,

but with Joe out now, it could all

be up for grabs again.

WINTERS

He thinks he's gonna have trouble

marchin' the ball down the old fund-

raisin' board, huh?

HOWARD

The facts are, all we have left are

freshman quarterbacks, and nothin' I

saw at practice today, convinced me

that any of them are ready to step

in.

WINTERS

What are you sayin?

HOWARD

We gotta get Bobby Collins back.

WINTERS

Wilson say that?

HOWARD

He didn't have to.

WINTERS

Forget it, Galen, Collins is no All-

Star either.

HOWARD

Yeh, but he's good enough to get us

a split of the next four games.

WINTERS

Look, just because you're Wilson's

boy all of a sudden, doesn't mean

I'm gonna let him make me look like

a fuckin' whore.

HOWARD

Don't give me that high and mighty

shit. There's a lotta people on the

bubble here. Four straight loses and

we're out of bowl contention. How's

that gonna make you look? If you're

too stupid to consider your own

situation, then maybe you oughta

think about your assistant coaches.

They've got families to feed too.

FOWLER

Therefore, I respectfully submit

that Bobby Collins should not be

given special treatment just because

he's a football player. Would a

regular student get a reinstatement

hearing if they'de been caught

cheating? Nobody's talking about

letting the girl who took the test

back in.

LEARNIHAN

I think it's also instructive to

look at some of the courses this

young man has taken. Beginning Golf,

Voice and Speech Improvement...

SHANE

I'd like to point out that Mr. Collins

was still on schedule to get his

degree.

LEARNIHAN

(pointing to Collin's

transcript)

In what, Swimming Pool Management?

CHAIRMAN

Would you like to respond, Coach

Winters?

WINTERS

I don't know much about all this

other stuff, but I do know the

punishment should fit the crime.

Cheating's bad, but I don't think it

deserves a life sentence. Here's one

of those athletes who takes college

level courses, who wants to graduate.

I think Bobby Collins made a big

mistake, but he's already been

suspended for several weeks. He's

served his time. I think he deserves

a second chance.

LEARNIHAN

Like Alvin Mack? We gave him a second

chance and since he's had 5

incompletes, 4 withdrawals and still

reads at a fourth grade level. You're

using his body to make money for the

Athletic Department -- you, yourself,

are making three times what the

Chancellor is -- but obviously no

one is making an effort to see that

this kid gets an education.

WINTERS

He's helpin' to pay for your physics

lab too. If you're willin' to go

without a new office, maybe I could

hold him out a few games. Save his

body.

CHAIRMAN

Gentlemen...

SHANE

Alvin was way behind in school when

he got here. You can't make up for,

in four years, what it took 18 to

create.

LEARNIHAN

Then he should never have been

admitted in the first place. It's

not fair to other students who worked

hard to get here.

HOWARD

Is it fair to exclude kids who come

from inferior schools? You hold

everybody to the same standards,

you're discriminating against the

poor kids.

WINTERS

Most of my players are farm boys,

inner-city kids. Football is their

deliverance.

LEARNIHAN

Deliverance from what? A valid

education?

WINTERS

You throw Bobby Collins and Alvin

out, you take away their futures. In

Alvin's case you probably cost him a

couple million dollars in the pros.

LEARNIHAN

But this is not a football vocational

school. It's an Institute of Higher

Learning.

WINTERS

Yeh, but when was the last time 80,000

people showed up to watch a kid do a

chemistry experiment?

CHAIRMAN

Gentlemen, please, let's get back to

the business at hand, Bobby Collins.

As you know, I played football here.

And I remember how hard it was to

practice and then study when you're

dead tired. So I have some sympathy

for this young man. But I never

cheated, so the real question is his

character. Since you know him better

than anyone else in this room; and

having talked to him and observed

him over the last several weeks, do

you feel he's learned his lesson? In

other words, can you vouch for his

character?

WINTERS

(it's killing him)

Yes, sir, I can.

LEARNIHAN

Another case like this, I'll take it

all the way up to the Governor.

WINTERS

Don't mess with me, Learnihan. I'll

have you teachin' Study Hall.

CAMILLE

Hello, my name is Camille Schaeffer.

I'd like to speak to Joe Kane.

NURSE

You've got a phone call. A Camille

Schaeffer.

NURSE

She says she's your girlfriend

JOE

I don't want to talk to her.

NURSE

You sure?

JOE

Yeh.

NURSE (V.O.)

I'm sorry, he doesn't wish to speak

to you right now.

BUD

Hey, Louanne, how ya' doin?

LOUANNE

Fine, Bud, ya know. Goin to J.C.,

hopin' to get back in here next year.

Just came by to give Bobby some

laundry I did for him.

BUD

You two seein' each other again?

LOUANNE

Yeh, he was even talking about us

gettin' a place off campus together,

until he got reinstated. I don't

know how I woulda told my dad.

BUD

Ah, Louanne...

(pained to say it)

I wouldn't go in there right now.

LOUANNE

Why not?

LOUANNE

Ah. Guess I'm pretty stupid when it

comes to men. I never learn, do I?

BUD

I think maybe men are just stupid

when it comes to you. If you ever

feel like, ya know, just talkin'

sometime, gettin' a beer -- let me

know. My schedule's pretty open.

LOUANNE

Thanks, Bud

(handing him the

clothes)

Give him these, will ya?

WINTERS

Get up. I wanta talk to you.

WINTERS

Don't sit up. Stand up. If you can.

WINTERS

What's the matter, Joe? You won't

shake hands with me.

(Joe is silent)

You don't want me to see your hand,

do you?

(more silence)

So I guess what I heard was true,

huh? You been poundin' the walls

with your passin' hand, right?

(silence)

I tell you what, Joe, you want to

hit somethin', hit me.

WINTERS

I said hit me. I'm the one who put

you in here. Don't hit the damn wall.

It ain't the wall's fault. Hit me!

Go on, hit me right now!

WINTERS

Who else you wanta hit, huh? you're

daddy maybe? Cause he's a no-show

prick? Well, I'm a daddy, too, and

not a very good one at that. So just

hit me instead! I'll take your daddy's

beatin' for him. Go on, you want to.

Hit me, damnit!

WINTERS

(pushes Joe in the

chest)

Hit me! I'm not gonna leave you alone

until you hit me.

(shakes Joe by

shoulders)

The guys'll thank you. They've always

wanted to do it. So do it now, damnit!

Do it!

WINTERS

O.K., Joe, it's o.k. I guess I need

it more than you do.

(pause)

You gotta quit beatin' up on yourself.

Let me see that hand.

WINTERS

It's o.k.

(playfully)

You can still throw with it, you

fuckin' mook.

(pause)

Look, the nurses say this is the

toughest time for you right now. I

thought I'd stick around a little,

case you wanta play some cards, pick

a fight with the wall again,

whatever...

JOE

You don't have to.

WINTERS

Yes I do.

DISSOLVE TO:

PATIENT

Hey, Joe, don't you wanta watch the

game? It's on cable.

JOE

No thanks.

PERRY

E.S.U. on the strength of a 62 yard

touchdown run by freshman Darnell

Jefferson, squeaked by the North

Carolina Tarheels today, 14 to 13,

keeping their bowl hopes alive.

HARVEY (V.O.)

E.S.U. hoping to get past a tough

Iowa Hawkeyes team in their last

game before the return of star

quarterback, Joe Kane.

ALVIN

I know you, motherfucker. You're the

prick who got my little sister

pregnant. We ain't seen you around

lately. Where you been, huh? Answer

me, motherfucker, or I'm gonna peel

your cap.

WINTERS

Shit, Lattimer...

WINTERS

Oh, no...

HARVEY (V.O.)

Oh, boy, this does not look good,

Harmon. They're bringing the

stretchers out...

ALVIN

(wailing in pain)

Oh, shit, oh shit, I'll kill that

motherfucker. I'll... Oh shit...

HARVEY (V.O.)

Twelve seconds left, Iowa driving

for the winning touchdown. Fourth

and goal at the one. E.S.U. trying

to hold on without their star middle

linebacker, Alvin Mack.

REPORTER (V.O.)

Coach, you've lost two of your last

four.

REPORTER

Why do your teams seem to nose dive

at the end of the last couple seasons?

COACH WINTERS

This was a tough loss, but this ain't

any nose dive. We've had some key

players out, but if we win next week,

we'll still win the conference and

go to a major bowl on New Year's

Day. I mean, I know you guys can't

write, but I thought you could at

least count.

WINTERS

You look good, Alvin.

ALVIN

Yeh, I feel o.k.

WINTERS

Any of the guys been down yet?

ALVIN

They called.

WINTERS

Hell, you know how football players

are about hospitals and injuries.

ALVIN

Yeh.

ALVIN

I'm never gonna play again, am I?

WINTERS

Doctors aren't always right, Alvin...

but I just want you to know... you're

the best defensive football player I

ever coached.

WINTERS (V.O.)

Congratulations. I'm proud of you,

Joe.

WINTERS

I know you had a difficult time.

Michigan is easy, right? Bourbon is

tough.

JOE

Scotch.

WINTERS

I got somethin' for ya. Coupla round

trip tickets. Go see your dad. Get

it cleaned up.

LATTIMER

(on the phone)

I'm gonna have to take a test with

the coach right there. You sure you

got somethin' better than blockers?

DEALER (V.O.)

Much better. This guy is foolproof.

See ya Saturday.

WINTERS

I wanta do something different for

this game. Try to maximize our speed,

but keep you both in the lineup at

the same time. Ray, I'm moving you

to fullback. Darnell, you're startin'

at tail.

WINTERS

Ray, you'll be carrying the ball

less and blocking more, but they'll

still have to respect your running

and pass-catching ability. Not

everybody can make a transition like

this. You think you can handle it?

RAY

(tight lipped)

Yes, sir.

WINTERS

Good. We can't afford any hang dogs.

JOE

Hello, Camille.

CAMILLE

(cool)

Hello, Joe. You allright now?

JOE

Yeh... yeh, I think so.

CAMILLE

Good, I'm happy for you.

JOE

Camille, hold on, O.K.? I'm sorry

that I didn't want... that I couldn't

see you.

CAMILLE

You couldn't even talk to me. What

happened to "there's somethin' goin'

on between you and me"?

JOE

C'mon, Camille, I was embarrassed. I

couldn't...

JOE

(shouting after her)

I couldn't understand why anybody

would wanta talk to me. Camille!

JOE

How ya doin', Dad?

DAD

(surprised to see him)

Joe! What's this? They throw you

out?

JOE

No.

JOE'S DAD

I heard about your little set-to.

They had it on the news here.

JOE

Yeh, they sent me to rehab.

JOE'S DAD

We know what that's worth. Your

brother's been through it three times.

JOE'S DAD

So what are you doin' here?

JOE

I've been thinking about some things,

Dad.

JOE'S DAD

That's what that damn rehab'll do.

Make you think about a lotta things

you can't do nothing' about.

JOE

I kinda been wonderin' why you never

came to any of my games. All those

years.

JOE'S DAD

Oh, I don't know. I guess I didn't

wanta make you nervous. You mighta

tried too hard and screwed up.

JOE

Or I mighta done real well. Which

woulda been harder on you, Dad?

JOE'S DAD

(sensing the anger)

What do you mean?

JOE

Mighta made you feel bad. Like maybe

it wasn't written someplace that we

all gotta go on our ass. Like maybe

you coulda done somethin' more, if

you'de tried a little harder.

JOE'S DAD

Or maybe I didn't wanta see you

gettin' all excited, all pumped up

with pride, when I knew one day it

would all come crashin' down. Just

like it did.

JOE

I think I spent the last couple years

hopin' I'd die before that day. But

you know what Dad? That day came and

I'm still here. And I got one more

game this year. I don't know how

well I'll play or even how much, but

I want you there.

JOE'S DAD

How would you feel introducing your

drunk dad to all your friends? You

think about that?

JOE

I could live with it, if you could.

(handing him a ticket)

Here's a ticket. Section 2, Row 6.

Fifty yard line. If you don't come,

I'll never ask you again.

JOE'S DAD

O.K., Joey. And good luck.

DARNELL

Hey, Autumn. How's Ray?

AUTUMN

Don't know. Haven't seen him since

the night I saw you. He'd been goin'

out.

DARNELL

Monica Lambert.

AUTUMN

You knew? Why didn't you tell me?

DARNELL

Didn't wanta win you over that way.

AUTUMN

I just wondered how your studying

was comin'. You ready for tomorrow?

DARNELL

The test? I hope so. I been workin'

pretty hard.

AUTUMN

Good...

(sitting down)

I talked to my dad last night.

DARNELL

Oh, yeah? How's he doin?

AUTUMN

Fine. We talked about you.

DARNELL

What did you say?

AUTUMN

(eyes brimming)

I told him I'd gone out with you...

I told him I wished I could still go

bowling.

CLAYTON

He's rusty. I doubt if we can start

him.

WINTERS

(simmering)

He's worse than that. He's outa shape.

(blowing his whistle)

All right, that's enough for today.

Practice is cancelled. Everybody off

the field, but Kane.

(the players hesitate)

C'mon what the hell are you standin'

around lookin' at? Get outa here.

WINTERS

Didn't do much while you were in

there, did ya?

JOE

Well, we didn't exactly have a team...

WINTERS

You could've worked out on your own.

JOE

I had some other things to worry

about...

WINTERS

Well, we're gonna make up for lost

time. We'll start by hoppin' the

steps.

JOE

Hoppin' the steps?! What, you're

gonna punish me now.

WINTERS

Don't talk back to me, Joe. I'll

kick your ass. I went easy on you,

'cause you had to get through detox,

but that's out to sea now. You let

this team down; you let this program

down. Start those steps. Right leg.

WINTERS

Now the left.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

WINTERS

70 guys. 70 guys who busted their

butts all year. Because of you they

might not win the conference. Because

of you they might not go to a bowl.

JOE

(barely able to stand)

I didn't wanna leave... I just screwed

up...

WINTERS

You dogged on them.

JOE

(stopping, exhausted)

No, no I never dogged. I worked my

ass off. I played hard...

WINTERS

(pushing him forward)

Then you shoulda stayed in shape.

Keep runnin', dammit.

JOE

(wobbling, starting

to break down)

I always played hard. I gave my

everything for you. When you came to

the Center, I thought you were really

worried about me. But you don't give

a shit. We're all just a buncha sled

dogs. If you had another guy who

could throw, you'da left me in the

fuckin' hospital.

(falling to his knees,

sobbing)

The only thing that matters is the

program, the god-damn program.

WINTERS

Nobody forced you to play football,

Joe. Not me, not the program, nobody.

But when you sign on, you commit

yourself to pay the price, to do

whatever it takes. Well, you haven't

paid the price yet. You still owe

this team. You owe this team big-

time.

(walking away)

Get a shower.

LATTIMER

What's this doin?

DEALER

Takin' doped urine outa your bladder

and puttin clean back in. Call it an

oil change.

WINTERS

Gotta get it done today, boys. Gotta

ring that bell. 60 minutes. 60 minutes

of mean. No prisoners. No mercy.

Nothin' but snot bubbles. Gotta ring

that bell, gotta ring that

Championship bell.

LATTIMER

(shouting)

Ding Motherfucking Dong!!

HARVEY (V.O.)

Wolves movin' left to right on your

radio dial. Looking to generate some

offense. They've been up and down

the last few weeks.

COLLINS

28 Thunder right. On go.

HARVEY (V.O.)

So the Wolves defense has held after

the fumble, and the Yellow Jackets

will opt for the field goal. Around

a 34 yarder. Ball is down, it's away,

it's long enough. And good! Georgia

Tech jumps out on top 3-0.

HARVEY (V.O.)

Collins back to pass, rushed, now

fires out in the flat. It's picked

off by Hill. Down the sideline. He's

gonna go in untouched. Touchdown,

Georgia Tech.

LATTIMER

C'mon guys, we're only down ten.

Let's get our fuckin' shit together.

DARNELL

You missed that block on purpose,

didn't you, asshole.

RAY

You're full of shit. You fumble, you

try to blame me.

DARNELL

It's Autumn isn't it? That's what

this is all about.

RAY

The hell with Autumn. You just can't

take a hit.

WINTERS

Don't tell me who started it. I don't

care. All I care about is this

football team. We win together. We

lose together. So whatever your

problem is, get over it. I don't

want any more of this shit.

Understand?

DARNELL AND RAY

Yes, sir.

WINTERS

As for the rest of you guys. Here's

what I think of the way you played.

WINTERS

(pointing toward the

Yellow Jackets' locker

room)

They're laughin' at you over there.

Makin' plans for the evening. They

never dreamed it'd be this easy. You

guys are nothin' but bugs splattered

on their windshield. You better stock

up on potato chips, 'cause you're

gonna be watching a lotta T.V. on

New Years Day.

WINTERS

Get warm, Joe. You're startin' the

second half.

WINTERS

By the way... don't let me see you

miss anymore blocks.

CLAYTON

Joe's too tentative, too cautious

out there. He seems flat. Maybe we

oughta give Collins another shot.

WINTERS

Joe just needs to get the feel back.

He'll be allright.

CLAYTON

Sam, we can't afford to wait...

WINTERS

(snapping)

I said he'll be allright.

HARVEY (V.O.)

5:51 to go. Georgia Tech up 10 to

nothing. The Wolves are gonna have

to find some offense in a hurry here.

Their defense has been keepin' them

in it.

WINTERS

Joe, I know that Rehab was good for

you. Got rid of a lotta bad habits.

But what about the rest of you? What

happened to the Joe Kane that used

to take command of this team, the

Joe Kane these guys i'd run through

a bulldozer for? They put him out

with the trash? What are you waitin'

for, somebody to feel sorry for you

cause you've had some problems? Nobody

in this stadium gives a shit. It's

time to step up, Joe. Time to sit at

the head of the Table.

JOE

All right, we've held these guys up

long enough. Give me time back here,

and I'll rip 'em apart. 16 shift,

green, bolt. First sound.

HARVEY (V.O.)

Nice bit of scrambling by Kane to

get it to the four, but it's gonna

bring up fourth and goal. No doubt

about it, with 3:45 they've gotta go

for it here, if they're gonna get

back in this game.

RAY

Give it to me up the gut, Coach.

They've been ignoring me. I know I

can score.

WINTERS

No, we're gonna go with the sweep.

JOE

28 Thunder right. On 2.

DARNELL

Shit!

DARNELL

Monster block, man. Monster

motherfuckin' block.

ALVIN

(softly to himself)

All right, defense. Let's get evil.

Kill 'em all, let the paramedics

sort 'em out.

HARVEY (V.O.)

1:11 and counting. Third and one.

The Wolves have got to stop them on

this play if they're gonna get the

ball back. A first down here and

it's all she wrote. E.S.U. is out of

timeouts.

WINTERS

Time for 2 plays. If it's not open

in the end zone, take the sideline.

As the offense runs onto the field,

Winters checks the scoreboard. 17

seconds left. Georgia Tech 10. E.S.U.

7.

HARVEY (V.O.)

Ball on the Yellow Jacket 35. 17

seconds left. Kane barking signals.

HARVEY (V.O.)

Field goal here ties it, but a tie

may not get the Wolves into a bowl.

Tough decision for Winters.

WINTERS

(to Joe)

You want me to send in the kicking

team or you think you can handle it?

JOE

Give me the ball.

WINTERS

O.K., let's do 24 inside slot, left

blue lightning.

JOE

(in huddle)

O.K., 24 inside slot, left blue

lightning. Let's put the women and

children to bed, and go lookin' for

fuckin' dinner. On 2.

JOE

This one's for you, Dad.

CHAIRMAN

Looks like the Timberwolves are back.

Probably brought the library with

them.

CHANCELLOR

Hope so.

(turning to Galen

Howard)

Give my sincere congratulations to

Coach Winters.

HOWARD

He'll be delighted.

FAT CAT ALUMNUS

15,10, touchdown!

AUTUMN

Daddy, you remember Darnell.

MR. HALEY

Yes, I do. Great catch, Darnell.

DARNELL

Thank you, sir. I got somethin' for

you.

DARNELL

My entrance exam. Got a 92. Coach

Winters said you got an 87. He looked

it up.

MR. HALEY

(laughing)

I'll kill him.

WINTERS

Hell of a throw, Joe. Good to see

you back.

WINTERS

And don't worry about the Heisman.

We'll gear up for it next year.

LOUANNE

You still feel like gettin' a beer?

LOUANNE

He's not a football player any more.

He's graduating this year.

WINTERS

He's still got a bowl game.

WINTERS

So make sure he doesn't violate

curfew.

HARVEY (V.O.)

An amazing conclusion to a great

season. We can see Steve Lattimer

down on the bench weeping tears of

joy as E.S.U. goes back to a bowl

for the first time in three years.

CAMILLE

What are you doin' here?

JOE

Waitin' for you. I figured you'de

have to come through here on your

way to dinner.

CAMILLE

Shouldn't you be out celebrating?

You played real well.

JOE

I need your help with somethin'. I

know I'm not your favorite guy right

now, but it's all startin' again.

The expectations, the pressure, the

talk about the Heisman next year. I

was wonderin' if you'de like to go

somewhere, maybe share a six-pack

with me?

JOE

I miss you, Camille. I don't like

bein' without you.

CAMILLE

I'll think about it.

HUMES

Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary

and player profiles in the briefcase.

We got a 9:00am tomorrow in Baltimore

with the kid from Park. Then we're

on to...

FADE OUT

THE END
