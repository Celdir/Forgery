Man on the Moon (1999)

by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski.

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)

Hallo.  I am Andy.  Welcoom to my

movie.

(beat; he gets upset)

I hoped the story of my life would

be nice...but it turned out

terrible!  It is all LIES!  Tings

are mixed up... real people I knew

play different people.  WHAT A MESS!

So I broke into Universal and cut

out the junk.  Now it's much

shorter.  In fact, this is the end

of the movie.  So tanks for comink!

Bye-bye!

ANDY (AS REGULAR VOICE)

Okay!  Just my friends are left.  I

wanted to get rid of those other

people... they would have laughed in

the wrong places.

(beat)

I was only kidding about the

movie... it's actually PRETTY GOOD!

It shows everything... from me as a

little boy until my death --

(his eyes pop; he

covers his mouth)

Oops!!  I wasn't supposed to talk

about that!  Oh.  Eh, uh, we better

just begin.  It starts back in Great

Neck, Long Island...

ANDY

Oh, yes.  I remember it well...

DISSOLVE TO:

STANLEY

That's my boy!  Good swingin',

kiddo.

(warm beat; then a

look)

Hey -- Michael... where's your

brother?

MICHAEL

He's inside.

STANLEY

Is he in his room?

JANICE

Of course he's in his room.

(aggravated)

All his "friends" are in there.

ANDY (O.S.)

(as WORRIED GIRL)

But professor, why are the monsters

growing so big?

(now as BRITISH

PROFESSOR)

It's something in the jungle water.

I need to crack the secret code.

ANDY

(as BRITISH

PROFESSOR)

Maybe I should talk to the natives.

(as dancing NATIVES)

Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo

ba --

STANLEY

Andy!

ANDY

(startled)

Oh!

STANLEY

Andy, this has to stop.  Our house

isn't a television station.  There

is not a camera in that wall.

STANLEY (cont'd)

(trying to cope)

Son... listen to me.  It isn't

healthy.  You should be outside,

playing sports.

ANDY

But I've got a sports show.

Championship wrestling, at five.

STANLEY

(he blows his top)

You know that's not what I meant!

Look, I'm gonna put my foot down!

No more playing alone.  You wanna

perform, you GOTTA have an audience!

ANDY

(he points at the

wall)

B-but I have them.

STANLEY

No!  That is NOT an audience!  That

is PLASTER!  An audience is people

made of flesh!  They -- live and

breathe!  Got it?!

CUT TO:

ANDY

(as KIDDIE SHOW

HOST)

And now, boys and girls!  It's time

for... TV Fun House!

(he makes an

APPLAUSE SOUND)

Hi, everybody!  Are you ready for a

singalong?  I'll say the animal, and

you make his sound!  Okay...?  Okay!

(he starts to SING)

"Oh, the cow goes........."

CAROL

Moo.

ANDY

(he smiles, pleased)

"And the dog goes......"

CAROL

WOOF!

ANDY

"And the cat says......"

DISSOLVE TO:

DRUNK AUDIENCE

MEOW!!

ANDY

"And the bird says..."

DRUNK AUDIENCE

TWEET!!

ANDY

"And the lion goes..."

DRUNK AUDIENCE

ROAR!!

ANDY

"And that's the way it goes!"

(he grins)

Thank you.  Goodbye!

MANAGER

The comedy stylings of Andy Kaufman,

Ladies and Gentlemen!

CUT TO:

ANDY

So, Mr. Besserman, same slot

tomorrow...?

MANAGER

(awkward)

Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm...

thinkin' of letting you go...

ANDY

You're firing me??

(beat)

You don't even pay me!

MANAGER

Look -- I don't wanna seem

insulting.  But... your act is like

amateur hour: Singalongs...

puppets... playing records...

ANDY

What do you want?  "Take my wife,

please"??

MANAGER

Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the

traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a

little blue material...

ANDY

I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what

everyone else does!

MANAGER

Well, everyone else gets this place

cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to

move the booze when you're singin'

"Pop Goes The Weasel."

MANAGER (cont'd)

I'm sorry.  You're finished here.

THUG #1

Give us your wallet.

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)

I -- doo not unterstand!!

THUG #1

Give us your money!

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)

What??  What mooney?  Abu daboo!  I

do not have mooney!

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)

Pleaze!  I just move to America

yezterday!  I do not know!

THUG #1

What's in the case?

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)

NO!  Eeet, eet is just perzonal

trifles from my homeland --

THUG #2

Shut up!  Gimme that thing!

THUG #1

Goddamn immigrants!

THUG #2

This guy's pathetic.  Let's go.

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)

Tank you veddy much...!

CUT TO:

WISEASS COMIC

So I'm getting my mother-in-law a

special Christmas present: A pre-

paid funeral!  The mortician asked

me if I wanted her buried, embalmed

or cremated.  I said, "Make it all

three!  I'm not takin' any chances!"

(the crowd LAUGHS)

Thank you.  Good night!

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)

Now?  Now...?

(looking around)

Tank you veddy much.  I am very

happy to be here.  I tink -- this is

a very beautiful place.  But one

ting I do not like is too much

traffic.  Tonight I had to come

from, eh, and the freeway, it was so

much traffic.  It took me an hour

and a half to get here!

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)

But -- talking about the terrible

things: My wife.  Take my wife,

please take her.

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)

No really, I am only foolink.  I

love my wife very much.  But she

don't know how to cook.  You know,

one time, she make a steak and

mashed potato.  Ehh, and the night

before, she make spaghetti and

meatballs.  Her cooking is so bad...

is terrible.

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)

Right now, I would like to do for

you some imitations.  So first, I

would like to imitate Archie Bunker.

(no change in his

voice)

"You stupid, everybody ees stupid!

Ehh, get, get out of my chair

Meathead... go in the, eh, Dingbat

get into the kitchen, making the

food!  Ehh, everybody ees stupid!  I

don't like nobody, ees so stupid!"

Tank you veddy much.

(pleased, he proudly

bows)

Now I would like to imitate Jimmy

Carter, the President of the United

States.

(no change in his

voice)

"Hello, I am Jimmy Carter, the

President of the United States."

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)

And now... I would like to imitate

the Elvis Presley.

ANDY (AS ELVIS)

Thank you very much.

ANDY (AS ELVIS) (cont'd)

(SINGING)

"Warden threw a party

In the county jail!

Prison band was there

And they BEGAN to WAIL!"

GEORGE

Pst.  What's the story with this

guy?

BUDD

I think he's Lithuanian.  None of us

can understand him.

GEORGE

He does a hell of an Elvis.

CUT TO:

GEORGE

Hey, I really enjoyed your set.

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)

Tank you veddy much.

GEORGE

So I understand you're from

Lithuania?

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)

No.  Caspiar.

GEORGE

Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)

It's a veddy small island in de

Caspian Sea.

(beat)

It sunk.

GEORGE

Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.

(beat)

Well, look, I'm probably out of my

mind -- but I think you're very

interesting.  If you ever need

representation... we should talk.

ANDY

Mr. Shapiro, it's an honor!!

GEORGE

Caspiar, huh?!

CUT TO:

ANDY

You see, I want to be the biggest

star in the world.

GEORGE

People love... comedians.

ANDY

I'm not a comedian.  I have no

talent.

(he shrugs)

I'm a song-and-dance man.

ANDY (cont'd)

Mmm!  I particularly recommend the

Lotus root.

GEORGE

You show a lot of promise... but...

my concern is I don't know where to

book you.  You're not a stand-up...

your act doesn't exactly translate

to films... help me... where do you

see yourself?

ANDY

(bright)

I've always wanted to play Carnegie

Hall.

GEORGE

Yeah, ha-ha.  That's funny.

ANDY

See, I don't want easy laughs.

ANDY (cont'd)

I want gut reactions!  I want that

audience to go through an

experience.  They love me!  They

hate me!  They walk out -- it's all

GREAT!

ANDY (cont'd)

After I'm famous, I can sell these

as "Worn by Andy Kaufman."

GEORGE

You're insane.

(then sincere)

But -- you might also be brilliant.

Alright, Andy... let's do it.

GEORGE

Sammy, opening for David Brenner is

a fine gig.  You'll be on the

road... get some exposure...

SECRETARY (O.S.)

Tony Clifton on the phone!

GEORGE

Who?

SECRETARY (O.S.)

He says he's an associate of Andy

Kaufman's.

GEORGE

Oh.

(back to the phone)

Sammy, think about it.  I gotta go.

(he punches a line)

Hello?  George Shapiro here.

TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)

Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?

GEORGE

(beat)

Er, yes.  Speaking.

TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)

"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking,

creaking... Freaking!

GEORGE

Can I help you with something?

TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)

Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy

Kaufman, if you know what's good for

you!

GEORGE

(stunned)

Who is this?

TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)

You -- you know damn straight who it

is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to

respect.  A name to fear.

(beat)

Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.

GEORGE

Look... I don't know what your

problem is...

TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)

Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you

sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!

LITTLE WENDY

Now, while continuing your deep

breathing, slowly open your eyes.

You should feel rested, relaxed, and

alert.

YOGI

Do any thoughts come...?

STUDENT #1

My mind is clear.  I feel great.

YOGI

Good...

STUDENT #2

All the tension is gone from my

body.

ANDY

I want to thank you, your Holiness.

My heart is radiating with pure

energy.

YOGI

You always had a good heart.  But

I'm proud of the progress you've

made in your discipline.

ANDY

Yes.  TM got me focused.  In fact,

my manager got me a TV gig!  It's

just some new show with no budget,

but I'm still excited.

YOGI

Are you at peace with your family?

ANDY

Um, yes.  I haven't fought with

them, since I started here.

YOGI

Goals are important.

ANDY

I stopped drinking.  I gave up

drugs.  And I'm meditating three

hours a day.  It's the center of my

life...

YOGI

We are all impressed.

LITTLE WENDY

Okay.  Anyone else --?

ANDY

Oh, wait!  I have a question.

(beat; working up

his nerve)

Is there... is there a secret to

being funny?

YOGI

Yes.  Silence.

CUT TO:

CAROL

I still can't believe my brother's

gonna be on TV...!

JANICE

I hope he doesn't get nervous.

STANLEY

What's the difference?  This thing's

on in the middle of the night -- no

one's even gonna see it.

HOST

Welcome back to Saturday Night Live!

And now, as a special treat on our

first show... musical guest ANDY

KAUFMAN!!!

LORNE MICHAELS

What's happening to him?

MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.)

"Although we are in danger,

We never despair,

Because we know where there is

danger

He is there!"

LORNE MICHAELS

Oh my God, he's doing nothing.  It's

dead air...!

MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.)

"We're not worrying at all.

We're just listening for his

call..."

MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.) (cont'd)

"Here I come to save the day!"

MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.) (cont'd)

"That means that Mighty Mouse is on

the way!"

CUT TO:

GEORGE

Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin'

out here!!

ANDY

The stewardess let me keep my

headphones.

GEORGE

That's... terrific!  But I got

something better.  This is BIG...

(giddy; milking the

moment)

You are getting a once-in-a-

lifetime, unbelievably lucrative

opportunity to star on... a

PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!

ANDY

Sitcom...?

GEORGE

And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the

guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore

and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes

place in a taxi stand!  And you're

gonna be the Fonzie!

ANDY

(confused)

I'm -- Fonzie?

GEORGE

NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout

character!  The guy that all the

kids impersonate and put on their

lunchboxes!

ANDY

(soft)

George, I hate sitcoms.

GEORGE

HANG ON, you ain't heard the best

part!  ABC has seen your foreign man

character, and they want to turn him

into --

(he checks his

notes)

"Latka," a lovable, goofy

mechanic!!!

ANDY

No.

GEORGE

"No"?  "No" to which part??

ANDY

No to the whole thing.  None of it

sounds good.

GEORGE

Andy... this is every comedian's

dream.

ANDY

I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And

sitcoms are the lowest form of

entertainment: Stupid jokes and

canned laughter.

GEORGE

(shocked)

B-but, this is classy... they did

Bob Newha--

ANDY

I'm not interested.  I want to

create my own material.

GEORGE

You have to do it.

ANDY

I refuse.

GEORGE

(he explodes)

LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've

been in this business for twenty

years!  I know!  If you walk away

from this opportunity, you will

never, NEVER see another one like it

again!!!!

ANDY

Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.

(beat)

But I have a few terms.

GEORGE

(relieved)

Of course!  That's what negotiations

are for.

GEORGE (cont'd)

What are you doing?

ANDY

Writing down my terms.

GEORGE

Are you makin' fun of me --?  This

is RIDICULOUS!

ANDY

(blas)

Those are my terms.

GEORGE

They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!

(he points at one

item)

I mean -- "two guaranteed guest

shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is

this TONY CLIFTON?!

ANDY

He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to

do impressions of him.  We sorta...

got in a fight over that.

GEORGE

This Clifton called me up.  He's a

loon!  He HATES you!

ANDY

Nah, he just talks tough.  But I owe

him one.

ANDY (cont'd)

If I'm the new Fonz... ABC's just

gonna have to give me what I want.

(a sarcastic FONZIE

IMPRESSION)

Heyyyyyy!

GEORGE

Mr. Kaufman will only appear in half

the episodes.

(beat)

Mr. Kaufman requires an undisturbed

90 minutes of meditation prior to

filming.

(beat)

Mr. Kaufman won't rehearse.

(beat)

Mr. Kaufman gets his own network

Special.

GEORGE (cont'd)

And Taxi must guarantee two guest

appearances to... Tony Clifton.

NETWORK GUYS

WHO???

GEORGE

Tony Clifton.

NETWORK GUY #1

Who is he?!

GEORGE

(solemn)

I don't know.

GEORGE (cont'd)

But Andy says he's fabulous.

(awkward)

He also says, these are the terms.

NETWORK GUY #2

Couldn't Kaufman ask for more money,

like everyone else?

MAYNARD (cont'd)

George, we don't book phantom

performers.  The deal's off.

GEORGE

Andy?

ANDY (O.S.)

Hi George!

GEORGE

Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony

Clifton... is he performing

anywhere?

ANDY (O.S.)

Of course.

(beat)

But only on Monday nights.

GEORGE

That's alright.  Where...?

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

And now, Mama Roma's is proud to

present International Singing

Sensation... a man who has sold more

records than Elvis and the Beatles

combined...

ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd)

Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr.

Entertainment... TONY CLIFTON!

ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd)

Ladies and Gentlemen, out of respect

for Mr. Clifton's vocal demands,

could everyone please extinguish

your cigarettes and cigars.

ANGRY GUY

Goddamn, I paid five dollars for

this.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

And now!  A man who needs no

introduction... TONY CLIFTON!

TONY CLIFTON

Heh-heh.  How ya all doin'?

ANGRY GUY

Fuck you!

TONY CLIFTON

(singing)

"Volare!

Whoa, whoa.

Cantare,

Whoa whoa whoa whoa."

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

(singing)

"I got the wings of your love,

I got the wings of a dove.

I got the... uh...

(forgetting the

words)

... the chicken wings from

Eh, Kentucky Fried..."

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

Oh.  Whoop do doo,

Whoop de di,

Stick a needle in your eye...

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

Eh, the hell with that song.

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

So how ya doin'!

(leering)

How ya doin' over here?  How ya

doin' over there?

(he approaches a

WOMAN)

How's that pasta carbonara?

WOMAN

Leave me alone.

TONY CLIFTON

Okay!

(he spins around)

So, you havin' a good time, sir?!

SAD SACK

Sure...

TONY CLIFTON

What's your name?

SAD SACK

Bob.

TONY CLIFTON

(he reacts as if

this is enormously

funny)

"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.

(beat)

Bob what?

SAD SACK

Bob Gorsky.

TONY CLIFTON

"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?

SAD SACK

(meek)

Yes.

TONY CLIFTON

Are you tryin' to do some of that

Polack humor?  Well if that's so,

you can just get the hell out of

this restaurant!

SAD SACK

(timid)

It's my name.

TONY CLIFTON

SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

I do a clean show!  Like, I wouldn't

do that one... oh, you know it...

"What do you call a pretty girl in

Poland"?

SAD SACK

(he giggles

stupidly)

A -- a tourist.

TONY CLIFTON

See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin'

about!

(enraged)

Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

And stay out, Fatso!

ANDY

And YOU.  I wanna see you backstage!

GEORGE

Alright, I'm here.  What do you

want?

ANDY

Are you hungry?

GEORGE

I... I-I don't understand this act.

ANDY

(in jolly spirits)

It's good old-fashioned

entertainment.  Everyone loves a

villain.

GEORGE

Yeah?  Well tell that to the poor

schlub who you humiliated!

ZMUDA

Hey Andy, good show.

ANDY

Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob

and I have been buddies for years.

ZMUDA

That was a really hot house!

GEORGE

So your name's not Gorsky.

ZMUDA

Don't believe everything you hear.

CUT TO:

GEORGE

This has to stay in the room... but

here's the thing: Andy is Tony.  And

Tony is Andy!  They'll deny it up

and down, but I swear to God,

they're the same person!

(with urgency)

It's smart business!  You'll get two

Andy Kaufmans for the price of one!

GEORGE

Andy!

ANDY

(still playing the

game)

What's up?

GEORGE

Andy... THEY SAID YES!  They agreed

to it all!  They thought your terms

were a shining example of your

"irreverent wit" -- and precisely

why they want you!

(beat)

You're getting EVERYTHING!

ANDY

Well thank you very much...!

CUT TO:

TONY DANZA

Man, this is bullshit!

(he marches up to

the PRODUCER)

Where's Kaufman?  Why isn't he

here??

ED

You'll see him on Friday when we

shoot.  Now run the lines with

Rodney.

JUDD HIRSCH

I'm taking bets we do the show with

the stand-in.

MARILU HENNER

No, I hear Andy arrived.  Rumor is

he's locked inside his dressing

room.

ANDY

I'm gonna quit.

ZMUDA

What?!?

ANDY

Each show is worse than the next.

ZMUDA

Are you nuts?!  40 million people

watch you every week!

ANDY

So?  What do they know?

ZMUDA

Absolutely nothing!  That's the

beauty!

(he lowers his

voice)

It's credibility.  You make them

love you... and then later, on your

special, you'll screw with their

heads!

CUT TO:

MAYNARD

I don't care!  Travolta signed a

contract, he's a Sweathog for

life!... Oh yeah?  Just try to sue

us.

ASSISTANT

Sir, they're having a problem down

on the Kaufman Special.  They say

he's not following the... technical

requirements.

MAYNARD

"Technical"???

ANDY

It's my show!  Now make it roll!

TECHNICIAN

NO!

MAYNARD

Andy, I hear fabulous things about

the Special...

(a delicate pause)

Eh, I understand we've hit a teeny

speedbump?

TECHNICIAN

(harried)

Yeah, Kid Genius told me to mess

with the horizontal hold!  He wants

the picture to roll!

MAYNARD

Show me.

ANDY (ON-SCREEN)

And now... in her television debut,

the incredible Chubby Rosalie!!

ANDY

(happy)

It'll be great.  The viewer will

think their TV is broken.  They'll

get out of their chair, they'll

twist the knobs, they'll hit the TV,

but they won't be able to fix it!

MAYNARD

Andy... we don't want the viewer to

get out of their chair.  They might

change the channel.

ANDY

But it's funny!  It's a practical

joke.  They'll get frustrated!

MAYNARD

Andy... uhh... this network has a

long-standing policy: The viewer

must be able to see the program.

ANDY

But it's only for thirty seconds!

MAYNARD

Five.

ANDY

Twenty!

MAYNARD

Ten.

ANDY

Deal.

STUDIO PAGE

Mr. Kaufman, do you want your mail?

ANDY

... Yes, it's Andy Kaufman!...

Really! ...I got your fan letter...

So you like the show?  Your letter

said I was silly.  Did you think I

was too silly?... Oh good.  I'm

glad.

ANDY (cont'd)

It was real nice of you to send your

picture, Mimi... 'Cause you knew

what I looked like... and now, I

know what you look like!

ANDY (cont'd)

So, um... San Bernardino...

(beat)

That's just a couple hours away,

isn't it...?

MIMI

... so after I finish junior

college, I'll go to work for my

dad's accounting firm.  Unless, I

decide to live with my friend

Valerie, but she wants to move to

Anaheim, and I don't want to do

that.

ANDY

Oh.

ANDY (cont'd)

So do you wanna wrestle?

MIMI

Excuse me -- ?

Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good

way of breaking the ice.

(pause)

That instant physical intimacy

really brings two people together.

MIMI

What are you talking about?!  We

just met an hour ago.

ANDY

(calm)

No no no, it's not sex!  I mean --

it can lead to sex... but really,

it's just wrestling.

MIMI

I don't wanna talk about it!

MIMI (cont'd)

The sunset is really beautiful.

ANDY

What do you mean?

MIMI

(a bit offput)

I mean -- uh -- the colors in the

sky are so vibrant.  I love this

time of day.

ANDY

(he shrugs dully)

I've never understood that.  It's

just... getting dark.

(pause)

But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we

fill the car with gas, drive to

Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???

MIMI

I think I wanna go home.

CUT TO:

ANDY (ON TV)

You know... I was once in your

gallery.  I was just sitting there

and I wanted to touch you.  I was

kind of depressed because I could

see what everyone was like, and I

was wondering if, now, maybe I

could... touch you.

ANDY (ON TV)

(cont'd)

(choked up,

nervous)

EXEC #2

This is NOT funny.

EXEC #3

(ominous)

"Artsy Fartsy shit"...

GEORGE

(worried at this

response)

No... eh, the Special

isn't all like this...

just wait... it will be

hysterical.

MAYNARD

Christ!  We're the Number One

Network -- can't we afford decent

TVs?!

GEORGE

No, um... it's part of the snow.

Tell Kaufman we will NEVER air this

program!!

BLUE COLLAR GUY 1

Excuse me, could I please have more

coffee?

ANDY

Yeah, yeah, in a sec'.

(he lugs the dishes

to the kitchen)

That was decaf, right?

BLUE COLLAR GUY 1

You know, you look just like Andy

Kaufman.

ANDY

Yeah, I get that all the time.

BLUE COLLAR GUY 2

I'm telling you, it's him.

BLUE COLLAR GUY 1

You wanna bet??  If that was him, he

wouldn't be workin' here, pouring my

coffee!

GEORGE

Hey!  Could you clear this table and

bring me a piece of poundcake?

GEORGE (cont'd)

Andy, this is ridiculous.  Take off

that apron.

ANDY

(infuriated)

NO!  I'd rather work here, than at

ABC.  There's no lying in a

restaurant.  They don't promise you

a job as a cashier, then suddenly

make you a frycook!

GEORGE

Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes!

But we work in a creative business.

You can't predict what people are

gonna like --

ANDY

The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I

could have my own Special!

GEORGE

(trying to calm him)

Tell you what.  I'll book you on

some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll

show the Special around... see if

somebody wants to buy it --

ANDY

(bitter)

Yeah, we can have a garage sale.

"Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a

network TV Special for only fifty

cents!"

ANDY (cont'd)

How long is left on my Taxi

contract?

GEORGE

You signed for five years --

(awkward)

So four years, seven months.

ANDY

(he looks up)

Okay... I'll go back.  But just let

them know, first they ain't gettin'

Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!

CUT TO:

ANDY

Thank you.  It's great to be here.

We're going to have a very nice

time.  We'll sing some songs --

SORORITY GIRL

DO LATKA!!

ANDY

Uh, we'll play with puppets --

DRUNKS IN UNISON

LATKA!  LATTTTKAAAA!!!

ANDY

Excuse me one moment.

ANDY

Give me the book.

ZMUDA

(startled)

No!  Andy, don't do it --

ANDY

They're asking for it.

ANDY

Since you're such a special

audience... I'm going to reveal, for

the first time ever, the real me.

(he goes into a

CLIPPED BRITISH

ACCENT)

I'm actually British.  I was raised

in London and educated at Oxford.

And though I dabble in clowning, I

do find it so boorish.  So...

American.

(beat)

I prefer the fine arts.  Henceforth,

tonight,  I'd like to grace you with

a reading of the greatest novel ever

written!

(he holds up the

book)

"The Great Gatsby", by F. Scott

Fitzgerald!!

ANDY (BRITISH)

(he cracks open the

book)

Chapter One.

(he starts READING)

"In my younger and more vulnerable

years, my father gave me some advice

that I've been turning over in my

mind ever since.  'Whenever you feel

like criticizing anyone,' he told

me, 'just remember that all the

people in this world haven't had the

advantages you've had.'"

ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)

"He didn't say any more, but we've

always been unusually communicative

in a reserved way, and I understood

that he meant a great deal more than

that..."

FRAT BOY IN AUDIENCE

LATKA!!!

ANDY (AS LATKA)

Tank you veddy much!!!!

ANDY (BRITISH)

"When I came back from the East last

autumn, I felt that I wanted the

world to be in uniform and at a sort

of moral attention forever; I wanted

no more riotous excursions with

privileged glimpses into the human

heart..."

ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)

Please, let's keep it down.  We have

a long way to go.

(he resumes reading)

"Only Gatsby, the man who gives his

name to this book, was exempt from

my reaction - Gatsby, who

represented everything for which I

have an unaffected scorn..."

ANDY (BRITISH)

Chapter Two.

PROMOTER

Is he ever going to stop?

ZMUDA

(dour)

Sure.  When he reaches "The End."

ANDY (BRITISH)

"Tom was evidently perturbed at

Daisy's running around alone, for on

the following Saturday night he came

with her to Gatsby's party.  Perhaps

his presence gave the evening its

peculiar quality of

oppressiveness..."

WEAK VOICE

Do Latka.

ANDY (BRITISH)

Look!  I don't have to tolerate this

impoliteness!  Forget it -- I'm

gonna stop the show.  GOODBYE!

ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)

No, no, I'm only fooling.

ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)

I'll tell you what.  Would you

rather have me continue reading or

would you like to hear the

phonograph record?

ANDY (BRITISH-FROM THE RECORD)

"His presence gave the evening its

peculiar quality of oppressiveness -

it stands out in my memory from

Gatsby's other parties that

summer..."

DISSOLVE TO:

ANDY (BRITISH)

"Tomorrow we will run faster,

stretch out our arms farther... And

one fine morning - So we beat on,

boats against the current borne back

ceaselessly into the past."

ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)

The End.

ZMUDA

Nobody likes anarchy more than me...

but this is science fiction!

ANDY

Let's get some breakfast.

CUT TO:

GEORGE

What kind of show was this??!

(angrily reading off

a LIST)

There were three-hundred walkouts!

The promoter wants a refund!

ANDY

I'm sorry, George...

GEORGE

You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!

(turning on Zmuda)

And you -- you're the road manager!

You should be watchin' out for him!

ZMUDA

(a guilty sigh)

We might have lost our focus...

GEORGE

When you play the Midwest and South,

you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE!

It's not postmodern -- it's rude.

(beat)

If you wanna perform in Texas, you

give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em

Elvis!!

ANDY

But George, I like to push the

boundaries...

GEORGE

And that's great.  But do it in LA

and New York!  There you experiment!

Show up with a sleeping bag and take

a nap on stage!  I don't care!

ANDY

How long would they let me sleep?

GEORGE

I don't know!

(he composes himself

and lowers his voice

to a hush)

Andy... you need to look inside: Who

are you trying to entertain?  The

audience... or yourself?

CUT TO:

GEORGE

I'm worried about Andy.  His stress

level is affecting his work.

ZMUDA

(he thinks)

Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi

soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.

GEORGE

Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if

you can get him away from all this.

Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find

something special.  Something

nice...

CUT TO:

ANDY

I dunno about this...

(worried)

What will my mother think?

ZMUDA

She'll say, "Now my son is a man."

ANDY

It's so dirty.

ZMUDA

Nah.  The girls sponge off between

johns.

ANDY

Okay.

ZMUDA

Which one?

ANDY (GERMAN)

I vill haf both!  I vill haf dat

fraulein... unt... the vun vith the

big strudels!

ZMUDA

This is a big day.  It's my friend's

first time with a prostitute.

MADAM

(mocking)

What're you talking about?  Andy

comes here almost every weekend.

ZMUDA

You're talking about... Andy?

MADAM

Oh, he doesn't always call himself

that.  Sometimes he's Tony, and

wears a tux.

ANDY

You let me win.

HOOKER

(she giggles sexily)

What if we did...?!

ANDY

Hey.  If I give you three-hundred

dollars, will you come to LA and

help me destroy a TV show?

CUT TO:

TONY DANZA

Where is he?

ED

He just arrived.

CAROL KANE

He's an hour late.

ED

Look, I'm told this Clifton guy is a

little eccentric.  You're all just

gonna have to roll with the punches

this week.

TONY CLIFTON

Taxi!  Laxy!  Just the factsy,

Maxie!  Them's all the words that

rhyme with taxi!... Right, girls?

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

Eh, why the blue faces?  You musta

read the script!

(he chuckles)

Well, don't worry!  Your pal Tony

stayed up all night, writin' some

fixes on it.

(he pulls out some

SCRIBBLED PAGES)

I added me a musical number, cut out

Judd Hirsch, and changed the

location to Mardi Gras!

CUT TO:

TONY CLIFTON

And now, the new theme song!

(he starts SINGING)

"Oh yes, we drive a taxi,

And we're havin' fun.

Yeah, we work together,

And we get the freakin' job done."

ED

George, we've lost two days.

Filming is on Friday.  We HAVE to

let him go!

GEORGE

(worried)

I'm not sure how Andy's gonna take

this...

ED

So we'll go downstairs and tell him!

GEORGE

But that's Tony down there.  That's

not Andy.  Trust me, it's like

"Sybil" -- Andy's nowhere on the

premises!

ED

Well whoever the fuck that is, I'm

firing him!

GEORGE

(he sighs)

Okay.  But we'll have to warn Andy

first.  I think he's up in San

Francisco, doing a concert.

CUT TO:

GEORGE (INTO PHONE)

Hi, Diane, this is George.  I'm

trying to reach Andy up in San

Francisco.

(a stilted pause)

Yeah, I'll wait.

ANDY (V.O.)

Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!

GEORGE

Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up

there?

ANDY (V.O.)

Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always

foggy!

GEORGE

I'm here with Ed over at Taxi.

There's been some trouble with Tony.

ANDY (V.O.)

Oh no!  Did he get hurt?

ED

No, no, Andy, nothing like that.

(nervous beat)

But... Tony's not fitting in.  His

style of performance is too...

burlesque.

INTERCUT:

TONY CLIFTON (AS ANDY)

"Burlesque"?

BACK TO:

ED

Andy, I'm calling you up like this

because I have the utmost respect

for your artistry.  But -- I need

your permission to fire him.

ANDY (V.O.)

Oh dear!

(upset)

George, this is gonna kill Tony.

He's waited his whole life for this

break.

GEORGE

There'll be other shots.

ED

Andy, I have to do it.  He's a

terrible actor.

ANDY (V.O.)

I guess I understand.  But Ed --

please... let him down gentle.

ED

Yes, Andy, I will.

ED (cont'd)

Thank you.

CUT TO:

TONY CLIFTON

FUCK YOU!  I AIN'T GOIN'!!

ED

We had a deal!!

TONY CLIFTON

I don't know what yer talkin' about.

You musta talked to someone else --

ED

Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!

TONY CLIFTON

I don't know nothin' about no

Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my

coattails, smearing my reputation.

Been usin' my good name, to get

places.

ED

Get off my stage!  You're fired!

TONY CLIFTON

I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take

you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!

ED

Who're YOU?!

REPORTER

I'm from the LA Times.  We're doing

a little puff piece on Mr. Clifton.

(beat)

Mr. Kaufman arranged it.

ED

Security!  Escort this man off the

lot!!

TONY CLIFTON

Stop!  GETCHER HANDS OFF ME!

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

LEMME GO!  I'M A BIG STAR!

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

You'll be SORRY!  One day I'm gonna

OWN this town!!

ED

I don't want those pictures getting

out.

SECURITY GUARD

(to the reporter)

This is a closed set.  You'll have

to give me the film in that camera.

ZMUDA

I'll take care of this.

ED

Wait -- he's one of THEM!

TONY CLIFTON

Stop!  HELP!  You wouldn't do this

to Wayne Newton --

TONY CLIFTON

Hey.  Good hustlin'.

ED

That asshole!  That FUCKING

BASTARD!!

(he SLAMS the door

behind him)

We had a fuckin' deal, and THAT

COCKSUCKER SHAFTED ME!!

SECRETARY

Um, Ed... you have a phone call --

ED

I'M NOT IN!

SECRETARY

Well, um... it's Andy Kaufman...

ED

Yeah???

ANDY (V.O.)

You were brilliant.

ED

Huh?

ANDY (V.O.)

You were in the moment.  You became

a producer losing his mind.

(sincerely joyful)

It was the best improv I've ever

seen.

ED

Well -- thank you.

ANDY (V.O.)

Okay.  See you next week.

CUT TO:

ANDY

This is great!  It makes Tony REAL -

- three-dimensional!  It's very good

for his career.

ZMUDA

"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman?

And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy

Kaufman crazy?"

ANDY

(he chortles)

Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm

only acting crazy!

ANDY (cont'd)

Boy, this is tasty.

(he shouts to a

WAITER)

Hey, can I please have some more

seaweed?!

CUT TO:

BOOKER

Mr. Shapiro, this is Gene Knight, up

at Harrah's Tahoe.  We'd like to

book Andy Kaufman for our showroom.

INTERCUT:

GEORGE

Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like

playing casinos.  The audiences

don't work well for him.

BOOKER (O.S.)

Oh.

BOOKER (O.S.) (cont'd)

What about Tony Clifton?

GEORGE

(startled)

Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to

headline Harrah's Tahoe??

BOOKER (O.S.)

(being tricky)

Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand

our audience base -- and I know the

college kids really love Andy

Kaufman.

GEORGE

Look -- I gotta be clear with you.

Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.

BOOKER (O.S.)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!

(he LAUGHS merrily)

Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!

GEORGE

(frustrated)

No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony,

do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.

BOOKER (O.S.)

(LAUGHING harder)

I'll take my chances!!

GEORGE

Fine, be my guest!  Book him.

CUT TO:

GEORGE

Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're

not getting BOTH of them!

(upset)

It's physically impossible!

BOOKER (O.S.)

Why's that?  You said over and over

and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy

Kaufman --

GEORGE

Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But --

trust me, it's not gonna happen!

BOOKER (O.S.)

Sure it is.  Tony called me himself.

He yelled at me, insisting that his

dressing room be bigger than Andy's.

They're both going on tonight,

believe me!

CUT TO:

PUSHY MAN

You're not listenin'!  It's a VERY

simple concept.

WIFE OF PUSHY MAN

You're making no sense.  How can

they be the same person --?

PUSHY MAN

Trust me!  You'll never see them on

stage at the same time!

TONY CLIFTON

SHUT UP!!!!!!

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

THAT APPLIES TO YOU, TOO,

PENGUINS!!!

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

Yeah!  Yeah!  YOU!  I'm talkin' to

YOU!!  And you better freeze, or

I'll get your asses fired!!!

PUSHY MAN

He's never gonna start!  Kaufman

thinks this is funny!

(beat)

We've paid forty bucks for a show

that's never gonna start!

WIFE OF PUSHY MAN

You see!  I told you!  They're not

the same person!

TONY CLIFTON

Thank you!  Thank you!  I wrote this

tune for my friend Frank Sinatra.

He had a nice little success with

it... but forgot to thank me on the

album.

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

"Whether I'm right

Or whether I'm wrong

Whether I find a place in this

world

Or never belong!

I gotta be me!  I gotta be me!

What else can I be, but what I am?"

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

Let's bring it on home --

(he hits his

screeching CLIMAX)

"I GOTTA BE MEEEEEE!"

CUT TO:

GEORGE

You're so proud.  You're like some

retarded kid comin' home from

school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"

ANDY

But wasn't it funny?

GEORGE

"Funny"?  I dunno.  But

"intriguing"... "mindboggling"...

perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.

(softening)

Like, that moment, when you both

came onstage...

ANDY

Uh-huh!  See, with all these

articles, people think they're

insiders.  They see Tony Clifton,

and they say, "Ah, that's really

Andy Kaufman."  But that spoils it.

So NOW, Tony denying being me is the

truth!  Tony's not me!  But maybe he

is!  The audience will never know...

(giddy)

They'll think they're laughin' at me

-- but actually I'll be laughin' at

them, because they're wrong and I'm

right!

GEORGE

So you've got this big elaborate

joke, which is really only funny to

two people in the universe.

(dry)

You... and you.

ZMUDA

Sure!  But WE think it's kickass!

Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump

the glass of water on someone else's

head!

GEORGE

(he turns serious)

But what's the POINT?  How will any

of this make you the biggest star in

the world?

ANDY

George... I'm at a stage where the

audience expects me to constantly

shock them.  But short of faking my

death, or setting the theater on

fire, I don't know what else to do.

(thoughtful)

'Cause I've always got to be one

step ahead of them.

GEORGE

But I feel you're extending this

philosophy to real life.  It's

obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the

level anymore.

ANDY

George, it never was.

(pause)

Didn't you know that?

CUT TO:

ANDY

Look at this!  An evil Russian!

Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes

to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil

Japanese guy!

ZMUDA

What is this, World War Two...?

ANDY

You know, I always wanted to be a

bad-guy wrestler...

ZMUDA

No offense, pal, but I just don't

think you're built for it.  These he-

men'll kick your ass!!  They're

huge!

ANDY

Maybe I'll pick on someone smaller

than me...!

ANDY

... And I vow to continue wrestling

until I am BEA TEN, in a three-

minute match, with my shoulders

pinned to the mat!!

MERV

(nonplussed)

By a woman.

ANDY

Yes!  BY A WOMAN!

(emphatic)

I'm doing this because I feel that a

woman cannot beat a man in

wrestling.  Even if they train with

weights... it requires a certain

mental ability --

(a clumsy pause)

And, uh -- I just don't feel they

have that...

ANDY (cont'd)

No no!  Women are superior in many

ways.  When it comes to cooking and

cleaning, washing the potatoes,

scrubbing the carrots, raising the

babies, mopping the floors, they

have it all over men.  I believe

that!

ANDY (cont'd)

But when it comes to wrestling,

forget it!  If there's a woman that

can prove me wrong, come up here.

I'll shut my mouth and pay her 500

dollars.

MERV

Any... volunteers...?

LYNNE

I wanna kill that jerk.

CUT TO:

ZMUDA (AS REFEREE)

Will you please shake hands, go to

your corners, and come out

wrestling.

ANDY

I'm the winner!  I've got the

BRAINS!

(he points at his

head)

Now baby, don't fight nature!  Get

back in the kitchen where you

belong!!!

GUEST COORDINATOR

Here's your complimentary photo with

Merv.  Here's your Turtle Wax --

LYNNE

I don't need Turtle Wax.

GUEST COORDINATOR

Every guest of Merv gets it.  And

here's your dinner-for-two voucher

at Red Lobster.

ANDY

Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those

goodies!

LYNNE

Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody

else.

ANDY

Hey, I hope you didn't take that

stuff I said seriously.  It was just

part of the show!

(eager to impress)

It's like the old days, when a

carnival barker would try to rile up

the crowd.

LYNNE

Oh.  So you were just pretending to

be an asshole.

ANDY

It's what I'm good at!

CUT TO:

GEORGE

Merv Griffin has received 2000

pieces of hate mail.  Andy, Merv

Griffin doesn't GET hate mail.

ANDY

That means it was a success.  I woke

up the audience -- like punk rock!

(he hands him a

BARBELL)

Here, take this.

GEORGE

No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I

take it I'll break my back.

GEORGE (cont'd)

Buddyboy, they detest you!  Next

time you make an appearance, women

are gonna picket.

ANDY

They're having a laugh...

GEORGE

WRONG!  You haven't given them any

clues that it's a parody!

ANDY

That's because they've only seen it

once.  But I'll do it again, and

again, and AGAIN...

(a maniacal grin)

They'll catch on!

CUT TO:

ANDY

I am the Intergender Wrestling

Champion of the World!!!

CUT TO:

ANDY

Two, please.

ANDY

Hi...

LYNNE

Hi... am I late?

ANDY

No, I'm sure we'll be fine.

ANDY

Popcorn?

LYNNE

No thanks.

ANDY

I really want one.

(at the counter)

One large tub of popcorn, please,

extra butter.

ANDY (cont'd)

Okay.  Let's go.

LYNNE

Andy, the theater's that way!

ANDY

Hey, I love movie theater popcorn...

but that doesn't mean I have to sit

through "On Golden Pond."

ANDY (cont'd)

C'mon.  We'll go for a walk.

LYNNE

(beat; then she

laughs)

Fine.

LYNNE

Why did you call me?  The last

person I ever expected to get a call

from was you.

ANDY

Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so

impressed with your wrestling moves.

ANDY

Hi...

LYNNE

Hi... am I late?

ANDY

No, I'm sure we'll be fine.

ANDY

Popcorn?

LYNNE

No thanks.

ANDY

I really want one.

(at the counter)

One large tub of popcorn, please,

extra butter.

ANDY (cont'd)

Okay.  Let's go.

LYNNE

Andy, the theater's that way!

ANDY

Hey, I love movie theater popcorn...

but that doesn't mean I have to sit

through "On Golden Pond."

ANDY (cont'd)

C'mon.  We'll go for a walk.

LYNNE

(beat; then she

laughs)

Fine.

LYNNE

Why did you call me?  The last

person I ever expected to get a call

from was you.

ANDY

Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so

impressed with your wrestling moves.

LYNNE

You were impressed with something.

It's pretty odd when a man sports a

hard-on that large on national

television.

ANDY

Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.

LYNNE

I'm here, ain't I?

ANDY

Do you wanna to go to Memphis and

get married?

LYNNE

(incredulous)

Do I wanna go to Memphis and get

married?

ANDY

Yes.

LYNNE

Why Memphis?

ANDY

(he SPEAKS VERY

FAST)

Because Memphis is the wrestling

capital of the world!  I'll go in

the ring, and I'll announce that I

will shave my head and marry any

woman who beats me!  Then you'll

come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let

you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and

we'll get married on Letterman, like

Tiny Tim did on Carson... right

there on the show!  What do you

say???

LYNNE

And all this will be for real?

ANDY

(a soft smile)

If you want...

CUT TO:

ANDY

(screaming)

SHUT UP!

(more BOOS)

SHUT UP!  Show some respect!  I want

SILENCE when I speak!

ANDY (cont'd)

If any woman can defeat me, I will

pay her 1000 dollars!  Then I'll

shave my head bald!  And then as a

bonus -- that lucky lady will get to

marry me!!

LYNNE

Look here, Andy Kaufman!  I'll take

you on -- SISSY!

ANDY

Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well

I say -- get back in the kitchen!

LYNNE

("outraged")

No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm

gonna make you dry my dishes!

MAN

STOP IT!  This woman's a FAKE!

She's nothing but Kaufman's

girlfriend!

ANDY

T-that's not true --

MAN

It's a set-up!  And I won't allow

our great sport to be degraded by a

fix!!

LYNNE

Andy... who is that...?

LAWLER

I'm Jerry Lawler, the KING of

Memphis wrestling!!

(this gets HUGE

CHEERS)

So if Kaufman wants to tangle, I've

brought a real wrestler!  She's

trained and she's READY!!  Kaufman,

do you think you can handle... FOXY

JACKSON???!!!

CUT TO:

TATTOOED GUY

Are you scared???

LAWLER

Alright, you won.  GET OFF HER!

ANGRY VOICES

Jerry, help her!  Get in there!  Do

something!

ANDY

W-what are you DOING?  I don't fight

men!

ANDY (cont'd)

I'm gonna SUE YOU!

(he starts RANTING

berserkly)

Let me tell you something, Lawler!

I am not a hick -- I'm a national TV

star!  And I DON'T like a dumb

cracker pushing me around in the

ring!  I never agreed to wrestle

you!  So you know what I'm gonna

do???

(seething)

I'm gonna hire a lawyer to sue you

for every cent you've got!  This was

assault and battery!  In a court of

law, I'm gonna kick your Southern-

fried rump!!!

LAWLER

YEAH?!  Well I got news for you,

Andy Kaufman!  Wrestling is a

serious sport to me!  I don't like

anyone makin' fun of it, and I hate

anyone insultin' the South!  So we

can settle this two ways: We can go

to court... or you can get in the

ring with a man, and wrestle for

REAL!

ANDY

He -- can't get away with this.

(to Lawler)

YOU!  You think I'm CHICKEN?!

ANDY (cont'd)

(sarcastic SOUTHERN

ACCENT)

You wanna "wraaastle" me?!  You

wanna "WRAAASTLE" me???  Okay,

Lawler -- let's rumble!  Yeah, I've

only wrestled women, but they were

bigger than you!  In fact, they're

probably smarter than you, 'cause

you're from "Maaamphis, Taaanassee!"

(back to his regular

voice, he points at

his head)

I'm from Hollywood.  I have the

brains.  That's how I win.  And Mr.

Lawler, I'm gonna make you cry

"Mama!"

LYNNE

Is this an act -- or are you

addicted to causing trouble??

ANDY

(he jokingly

impersonates a

drunk)

I can shtop whenever I want...

LYNNE

Then stop treating me like a fucking

prop.

ANDY

(he drops the act)

I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the

action...!

LYNNE

I'm warning you, Kaufman:  One

morning you're gonna wake up... and

your head's gonna be shaved.

CUT TO:

GEORGE

Andy, do you realize you don't do

comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet

guy who used to do

(he SINGS Mighty

Mouse)

"Here I come to save the day!"?

(long beat)

Please, enough with the wrestling!

You've lost touch with reality!

ANDY

(ingenuous)

What, you don't think I can beat

him?

GEORGE

He is the Southern Heavyweight

Champion.  He'll kill you.

(very disapproving)

First, you piss-off women.  Then you

piss-off the South.  Then you get

killed!

(dry)

And I did the bookings.

GEORGE (cont'd)

Andy, look... there's a job I want

you to take -- guest-hosting the TV

show "Fridays."  It's not so hot...

but this is a great opportunity for

you.  The show's live, they'll give

you carte blanche, and you can get

back to the business of making

people laugh.

ANDY

You said -- live?

ANDY

I'm not comfortable with the last

sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!

JACK BURNS

Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what

we're known for!

(playing "stoned")

"Maui?  "Wowie!"

ANDY

(losing his temper)

You're not listening to me --

JACK BURNS

Don't worry!  The kids will love it

--

ANDY

(he BLOWS up)

But I don't do drugs!  And I don't

enjoy making light of them!

(YELLING)

I was promised creative control!

ACTOR

What a prick!

STANLEY

It's on!  JANICE, IT'S ON!

NARRATOR

In this next sketch, two married

couples are out to dinner.  Now...

everybody has secretly brought along

a joint --

(crowd WHOOPS, he

grins)

So, when each person leaves the

table, they sneak into the restroom

to get a little high...

CUT TO:

JANICE

I saw Michael!

STANLEY

Where?

JANICE

(points to the set)

There!

CUT TO:

MICHAEL

Afterwards, I'll take you backstage.

You can meet my brother.

MARY

"Gee, restaurants are amazing,

aren't they?  All these strangers

sitting around... stuffing dead

animals in their faces!  It's just

incredible!"

MELANIE

"If you say so."

ACTOR

"Excuse me, I'll be right back."

CUT TO:

JANICE

Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy

much to do.

STANLEY

He said he's coming back!

CUT TO:

ANDY

"Gee, that bathroom is so colorf--"

MELANIE

You okay, honey?  Something wrong,

Carl?

ANDY

I can't, um...

ANDY (cont'd)

I can't play stoned.

TECH DIRECTOR

Shit...!  What's he doing??

MAYNARD

It's okay.  Stay with it.

RICHARDS

(whispering to Andy)

Just read the cue cards!

ANDY

(he shakes his head)

I can't play stoned.  I feel really

stupid.

MELANIE

You feel stupid?  What about us?!

ANDY

You didn't have to do that!

RICHARDS

Hey!  CUT IT OUT!

MELANIE

You JERK!

JACK BURNS

Go to commercial, man!

(he turns to Andy)

Get off the stage!

ANDY

I said I didn't want to do the

sketch.

JACK BURNS

(he JABS him)

GET OFF!

ANDY

DON'T TOUCH ME!

TECH DIRECTOR

Go to three!  Eh, go to four!

CUT TO:

STANLEY

I shoulda made him play outdoors.

FLOOR DIRECTOR

We've gone to commercial!  I said,

WE'VE GONE TO COMMERCIAL!!

MELANIE

Oh my God --!

MELANIE (cont'd)

He's a fuckin' psycho!

MARY

Why didn't someone tell us???

MAYNARD

Excuse me!... I have an announcement

to make!  You've all just

participated in a "happening."  To

make it real, some of you knew, and

some of you didn't.

MAYNARD (cont'd)

But we don't want to upset the folks

at home.  So now Andy is now going

to apologize and explain that it was

all a prank.  Right, Andy?

ANDY

(very quiet)

Right...

MAYNARD

Okay, great!  So let's reset!

MICHAEL

Andy...!

CUT TO:

JANICE

Why is Andy doing this?  Why?...

Why?

ANDY (ON TV)

During the commercial, the people at

ABC asked me to apologize... and to

tell you the truth.  They wanted me

to explain that this whole fighting

episode was staged...

ANDY

And... um...

(choking up)

I can't do this.

(beat)

I-I can't say it.

(upset)

It's a lie!  A cover-up!

ANDY (cont'd)

Why are you laughing?  I'm not

trying to be funny!  They threatened

to fire me from Taxi, unless I gave

in to their demands!

(shaken)

But... I won't!  Because what you

saw was REAL!!

MAYNARD

Cue the commercial!

ANDY (ON TV)

These kinds of things go on everyday

at the networks, only you never see

it, because they cut to commercials.

(he talks extremely

fast, to get in as

much information

before he's cut off)

Now for sure they're gonna fire me,

so if you want to see me again,

you'll have to come to Memphis...

MAYNARD

I'm gonna STRANGLE George Shapiro!

JANICE

What's in Memphis?

STANLEY

Who knows?!  That kid is totally

meshuga.

CUT TO:

ANNOUNCER

And now!  The MAIN EVENT of the

evening!  The match you've been

waiting for: The King Jerry Lawler,

versus Hollywood Andy Kaufman!

UPSET VOICE (O.S.)

C'MON, KAUFMAN!  Christ, you're ON!

ANDY

Before we begin this event, I just

wanna say a few things to you foul

people.

(beat)

This city is filthy!  You

Southerners live like pigs!  So I'm

going to teach you some lessons in

hygiene... bring you out of your

squalor.

ANDY (cont'd)

Are you listening?

(audience BOOS)

OKAY!!!

JANICE

Why is he saying these things?!

STANLEY

They're gonna lynch him!

ZMUDA

(he shakes his head)

Nah.  He's just engaging a passive

audience.

ANDY

People, this is a bar of soap.  Does

it look familiar to you?  If you wet

it, it'll clean your hands.

ANDY (cont'd)

And now, for your next lesson: This

-- is toilet paper.

LAWLER

Kaufman, we've had enough!!  Let's

you and me do what we came here for

-- WRESTLING!

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

And Kaufman's left the ring!

Lawler's waiting for him to return.

LYNNE

(to Zmuda)

Is this a strategy?

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

And Kaufman's left the ring again!

He doesn't seem interested in

actually making contact with his

opponent.

JANICE

Andy, please.  Let's go home!

ANDY

Don't worry, Mom.  I'll make you

proud...!

LAWLER

Hey!  Did you come down here to

wrestle, or to act like an ass?

LAWLER (cont'd)

Look... if you get in here, I'll

give you a free headlock.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

It's a side suplex!!

REFEREE

(frantically

gesturing)

NO!  NO!

JANICE

JESUS CHRIST!!!!!

STANLEY

Why isn't he MOVING??

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Lawler has committed a PILEDRIVER,

which is an AUTOMATIC

DISQUALIFICATION!  Match goes to

Kaufman by disqualification, after

two minutes, twelve seconds!

LYNNE

ANDY!!!

(frantic)

Somebody get a DOCTOR!

ZMUDA

(yelling)

WE NEED A STRETCHER!!

JANICE

Andy!!  Are you okay?!?

ANDY

I'm fine, Mom, you can calm down.

STANLEY

B-but... we saw... your neck...

ANDY

Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked

the whole thing.

(beat)

It didn't hurt at all.  It was just

a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.

STANLEY

Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we

knew, you were DYING!  Look at your

mother -- she's still shaking!

LYNNE

ANDY!!!

(frantic)

Somebody get a DOCTOR!

ZMUDA

(yelling)

WE NEED A STRETCHER!!

JANICE

Andy!!  Are you okay?!?

ANDY

I'm fine, Mom, you can calm down.

STANLEY

B-but... we saw... your neck...

ANDY

Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked

the whole thing.

(beat)

It didn't hurt at all.  It was just

a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.

STANLEY

Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we

knew, you were DYING!  Look at your

mother -- she's still shaking!

ANDY

But that's it.  I needed you to

believe!  Our family will be in the

newspapers.  People will look, and

they'll be touched.  Because your

emotions were honest!

JANICE

Andy, I love you!  I love you,

whatever you do...!

ANDY

Geez, I'm sorry.  Maybe I shouldn't

have put you through all that...

(quiet)

Well, from now on, you'll always

know the rule of thumb: Anything

that happens to me... IS NOT REAL.

OLD DOCTOR

I don't see any injury to your neck,

Mr. Kaufman.

ANDY

Are you sure?

OLD DOCTOR

Positive.

ANDY

But my neck hurts... and I have a

slight cough...

OLD DOCTOR

It's probably just a strained

muscle.

ANDY

(intent)

Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.

OLD DOCTOR

If it makes you happy...

ZMUDA

(reading aloud)

"... has been rushed to a nearby

hospital, where doctors are checking

him for possible paralysis.  His

parents are at his bedside.  Fans

will best remember Kaufman as

lovable Latka on television's

Taxi"...

ANDY

It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my

death, they'll really miss me.

ZMUDA

It's working for Elvis.

GEORGE

(sarcastic)

Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin'

for his comeback.

(he sees an article

and winces)

God, listen to this!  "It was

morally wrong to take advantage of

such an unstable individual..."

ZMUDA

Wow, you can't BUY this kind of

publicity!

ANDY

George, let's not drop the ball on

this.  I've made some kind of cosmic

career move.

GEORGE

Thanks for seeing me on such short

notice.

(he takes a careful

beat)

I... I wanted to talk to you about

booking Andy on "Saturday Night

Live."

LORNE MICHAELS

George -- I don't know if Andy works

for our show anymore.  That

wrestling stuff... is such a

turnoff.

GEORGE

We agree completely.

(tactfully begging)

Andy has to reconnect with his core

audience.  So I got him on Letterman

tonight.  He's gonna apologize to

Jerry Lawler, then repent for all

his bad guy shenanigans.

LORNE MICHAELS

That's smart.

GEORGE

He's very sincere.

(quietly emphatic)

And he needs your show...

LORNE MICHAELS

Okay.  It'd be good to have the old

Andy back.

CUT TO:

ANDY

I apologize for all the wrestling

I've ever done.  I'm sorry for all

the abuse I've ever given...

(soft)

I was just playing bad guy wrestler.

That's not me... it's just a role.

But Jerry took it personally.

LETTERMAN

You said some pretty inflammatory

things.

LAWLER

He thinks everything's a joke -- but

it's not.

(to Andy)

Did you laugh when you were layin'

in the hospital??

ANDY

T-there wasn't a reason to purposely

hurt me --

LAWLER

You're a wimp.

ANDY

(upset)

My father said I should've gotten a

lawyer --!

LAWLER

Then your father's a wimp.

ANDY

(losing it)

And you're just poor white trash!

ANDY (cont'd)

I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS SHIT!

ANDY (cont'd)

YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT, Lawler!  I

WILL SUE YOUR ASS!  YOU'RE A FUCKING

ASSHOLE!

(he POUNDS the desk)

FUCK YOU!  FUCK YOU!  I WILL GET YOU

FOR THIS!!!

LETTERMAN

You said some pretty inflammatory

things.

LAWLER

He thinks everything's a joke -- but

it's not.

(to Andy)

Did you laugh when you were layin'

in the hospital??

ANDY

T-there wasn't a reason to purposely

hurt me --

LAWLER

You're a wimp.

ANDY

(upset)

My father said I should've gotten a

lawyer --!

LAWLER

Then your father's a wimp.

ANDY

(losing it)

And you're just poor white trash!

ANDY (cont'd)

I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS SHIT!

ANDY (cont'd)

YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT, Lawler!  I

WILL SUE YOUR ASS!  YOU'RE A FUCKING

ASSHOLE!

(he POUNDS the desk)

FUCK YOU!  FUCK YOU!  I WILL GET YOU

FOR THIS!!!

ANDY (cont'd)

I am sorry.  I am sorry to use those

words on television.  I apologize!

I'm sorry!

(demented)

But YOU -- you're a MOTHERFUCKING

ASSHOLE!!!!

INTERCUT:

LORNE MICHAELS

Jesus Christ.

CUT TO:

SMUG COMIC

Hi.  Um, we were supposed to have

Andy Kaufman on our show this week -

- but now our producers aren't sure

if it's such a good idea.

(beat)

Some of us at Saturday Night Live

think Kaufman's a comic genius.  But

others disagree... they say he's

just not funny anymore.

(beat)

So we're putting the decision up to

you.  Please call up and vote.  To

keep Andy, call 1-900-244-7618.  To

DUMP him, call...

ANDY

This is bad... I only got 28

percent!  I'm like McGovern in

'72...

GEORGE

And this wasn't "Merv."  This was

the hippest audience on television.

(grim)

They've turned on you.

GEORGE (cont'd)

It's like you two guys wanted to

destroy Andy's career!  Upsetting

all those people... putting out that

toxic venom...

(helpless)

What did you THINK would happen?!

ANDY

(guilty)

We were just trying to push the

envelope --

GEORGE

You're BLIND!  There is no envelope

anymore!!

(beat)

It hurts me to say this... but

there's only one solution --

(pained)

I don't want you two to ever work

together again.

JERRY LAWLER

I'm sorry.  We thought it was

funny...

ANDY

Jer', it's not your fault.  You were

terrific.

(sad)

But maybe George is right...

JERRY LAWLER

That's fine.  But I wouldn't have

traded it for anything...

(poignant)

Because for one brief, shining

moment... the world thought that

wrestling was real.

ANDY

We'll stay in touch.  Next time I'm

in Memphis, I'll stop by the house,

and Noreen can make me her double

chocolate cake.

JERRY LAWLER

Alright, buddy...

(choked up)

Stay good.

ANDY

Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I

can go back on the show, and say it

was rigged.  Demand a recount...

GEORGE

Andy!  You don't get it!

(somber)

They don't want you back.

ANDY

Open your eyes... close your eyes...

open your eyes... close your eyes...

open your eyes... close your eyes...

YOGI

Excuse me, Andy...

ANDY

Yes, your Holiness?

YOGI

This is very difficult for me to

say... but -- perhaps it would be

best if you didn't attend the

retreat.

ANDY

(surprised)

Why??  I... I attend every year.

YOGI

Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion

to TM.  But we feel that perhaps...

you and the program have grown apart

philosophically.

ANDY

"Philosophically"?

YOGI

(he sighs)

The wrestling... the sexist

remarks... the foul language...

these things are not becoming of an

enlightened individual.

(beat)

It seems you have no respect for

anything.

ANDY

Of course I do...

ANDY

Please!  You've GOT to let me take

the classes!  It's how I keep myself

BALANCED!!

YOGI

It is apparently not working.

ANDY

So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is

MEDITATE!!

YOGI

(pained)

Andy, don't raise your voice.  We

don't wish your presence here.

CUT TO:

ANDY

Go away.

LYNNE (O.S.)

It's me.

ANDY

Oh, it's open.

LYNNE

I brought you Haagen Dazs.

Chocolate.

ANDY

(mournful)

I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a

horrible person.

LYNNE

Andy, you're not horrible.  You're

just... complicated.

ANDY

You don't know the real me.

LYNNE

Andy... there is no real you.

ANDY

You're probably right.

ANDY

Do you wanna move in together?

CUT TO:

ANDY

Hey!  Our first phone call!

(he scrambles for

the phone)

Hello?

GEORGE (V.O.)

Andy... it's me.  I've got some

crummy news.

(long beat)

Taxi's been canceled.

GEORGE (V.O.) (cont'd)

Do you want me to come over?  Talk

about it?

ANDY

Um... no.  Uh, I'm sorta busy right

now.  Thanks.  We'll get together

next week.

ANDY (cont'd)

Yuck!

BUDD

And now we have a treat for you late-

night diehards.  The star of Taxi --

here in person, Andy Kaufman!

ANDY

Actually, Budd, you're wrong.  I

found out today that Taxi's been

canceled.

ANDY (cont'd)

Yeah, that's how I felt too...

though I don't know why.  'Cause for

years, all I wanted to do was get

off that show.

(quiet, very

confessional)

But now that nobody will hire me,

and nobody thinks I'm funny... I

guess it was probably a pretty good

job.

ANDY (cont'd)

Not to mention that my wife has left

me.  And she took the kids.

(he sighs)

I don't know what I'm gonna do with

myself.  My options are sorta

limited...

(beat)

This morning, I noticed I've got a

cyst, or some kind of boil, on the

back of my neck.  It's really

disgusting.  Look.

ANDY (cont'd)

So I was thinking, since I'm sort of

a quasi-celebrity, that I could

charge people to touch it.

(candid)

Does anybody want to pay a buck to

touch my cyst?

ANDY (cont'd)

I'm serious.

ANDY (cont'd)

No, no, you gotta pay first.

CUT TO:

ANDY

I made six bucks.  That's good

money.

BUDD

This is a comedy club -- not a

medical sideshow.

(trying to be kind)

If you wanna perform here, take a

shower, get some sleep, and pull

yourself together.  Come back and do

the material that people love: Do

the Mighty Mouse, the Foreign guy!

Andy, you gotta snap out of this

funk!  If you can -- I'll give you

the headline spot tomorrow.

CUT TO:

GEORGE

Hey, what's going on here?

BUDD

George, you won't believe it... I

got Andy to do all the old material!

(grinning)

And he's killin' them!

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)

... but one ting I do not like is

too much traffic.  Tonight I had to

come on de freeway, and it was so

much traffic...

(giggling)

It took me an hour and a half to get

here!

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)

But talking about the terrible

things: My wife.  Take my --

INTERRUPTING JERK

"Take my wife, please take her."

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)

T-take my wife, please take her...

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)

No really, I am only foolink.  I

love my wife very much.  But she

don't know how to cook --

INTERRUPTING JERK

"Her cooking is so bad, is

terrible."

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)

H-her cooking...

(Andy stumbles

uncomfortably)

Uh, cooking is so bad, is terrible.

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)

But right now --

ZMUDA (AS JERK)

"But right now I would like to do

for you some imitations.  First, the

Archie Bunker."

ANDY

Sir, do you have a problem?

ZMUDA (AS JERK)

Yeah, my problem is you're tired.

ANDY

I, I was asked to do this material -

-

ZMUDA (AS JERK)

Sure, because your new stuff's a

bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are

sick of you.  The wrestling... the

hoaxes...

ANDY

(defensive)

Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in

the papers --

ZMUDA (AS JERK)

Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!

GEORGE

(to himself)

Why...?  Andy, why...?

ZMUDA

I used to think you were original.

ANDY

I was very original!

ZMUDA

Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now,

you're creatively bankrupt.

(he gleams cruelly)

In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me

to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant.

It's just a fresh coat of paint on

an old broken-down routine.

(back to Andy)

Isn't that true???

ANDY

The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks.

So I was just giving 'em what they

want...

GEORGE

(sadly)

Andy, they don't think you suck.

They've just... lost a reason to

love you.

GEORGE (cont'd)

You've gotta make the public embrace

you again.  You have to win back

their sympathy...

ANDY

I'll come up with something.

CUT TO:

LYNNE

Andy!!... Where are you?  I've been

worried sick... NOW??... Where do

you want to meet?... Okay, I'll call

them...

ZMUDA

Look at that Grand Slam!  Two eggs,

two bacon, two sausage, two pancakes

-- $2.99!  How do they do it?

LYNNE

They get you on the coffee.

GEORGE

(irritable)

Excuse me -- but could Andy tell us

why we're here???

ANDY

I have cancer.

ZMUDA

Hey, that's good!  We can make that

play.

(spitballing)

And we'll really drag it out.  You

get better, you get worse... you

die...

GEORGE

FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste!

I want nothing to do with this.

LYNNE

Andy, are you serious?

ZMUDA

(grinning)

Serious like a heart attack!  Hey,

maybe I can push you around in some

goofy wheelchair!

ANDY

No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.

GEORGE

That's ridiculous.  You don't even

smoke.

ANDY

(emphatic)

I -- I got some freaky rare kind.

It's called large-celled carcinoma.

LYNNE

Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?

ANDY

They don't know... they've gotta run

more tests.

LYNNE

(starting to cry)

Have you told your family?

ANDY

No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad --

I've jerked 'em around so many

times.

GEORGE

Andy... you look me in the eye, and

tell me this is true.

ANDY

George -- it's true.

GEORGE

If I find out you're behind this,

I'll kill you.

ZMUDA

What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was

the one saying I didn't believe it!

GEORGE

Exactly.  That's the sort of thing

you guys would work out to fuck me

up.

LYNNE

How can you be so casual??!

ANDY

(he shrugs)

Even if I'm dying -- I still need

clean socks.

LYNNE

You're NOT DYING!

ANDY

Okay.  You're probably right.

LYNNE

God, you're so detached!!

TIMMY (ON TV)

Thank you, girl.  You're my best

friend.

ANDY

(on phone)

Dad...?

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

The cancer started in Andy's left

arm and spread to his lungs.  We've

initiated an aggressive radiation

program... see if we can eradicate

the affected cells.

(his BEEPER goes

off)

Excuse me.  I'll be right back.

CAROL

What a crock.

STANLEY

(angered)

How dare you make light of this!

CAROL

Dad, I cried when he broke his neck.

He's not gettin' me again --

STANLEY

(impassioned)

Jesus!  He's got lung cancer!

CAROL

See, that's exactly it!  He picked

lung cancer, because he doesn't

smoke.  That makes it weird!  If

he'd picked leukemia, it'd be

totally believable, and we'd all be

going, "Poor Andy, he's really

sick."  So he chose lung cancer,

because he WANTS us to be scratching

our heads, saying, "Is this real?"

JANICE

(trying to convince

herself)

Of course it's real.  We're in a

hospital...

MICHAEL

Mom, it's Cedars-Sinai!  It's a

showbiz hospital!  Andy's studio

friends probably run this place!

CAROL

He plans these things out.  He takes

over, hires actors...

(beat)

Personally, I didn't think that

"doctor" was very convincing.

MICHAEL

Did you notice his costume had the

wrong shoes?

CAROL

(excited)

Yeah!  He didn't have doctor shoes!

MICHAEL

We all know he's talked about faking

his own death...

STANLEY

Sure -- but what if he isn't?

(sad; poignant)

My son could be dying... and we're

actin' like we're on Candid Camera.

CUT TO:

WILD-HAIRED MAN

I want you to visualize.  Visualize

big, healthy white cells in your

body.  Now visualize little cancer

cells.  Now those big white cells

are attacking the cancer cells...

ANDY

I see them... I see the white

cells...

CUT TO:

GEORGE

What was that all about?

ANDY

It's visualization therapy.  He's

helping me turn inward and fight the

disease.

GEORGE

He's an actor.  I remember him in

"The In-Laws."

ANDY

Uh, yes... that's true.  But he's

also ordained in holistic medicine.

ANDY (cont'd)

George, what am I supposed to do?!

I'm sick, and I'm tryin' to get

better... but everyone's lookin' at

me funny!  Even you come to my home

and act like I'm puttin' on a skit!

GEORGE

You must take a little pleasure in

it.

ANDY

Of course!

(beat)

But that doesn't mean I don't need

everyone's support!  I can't be

surrounded by negative energy.

GEORGE

Andy, you're surrounded by what you

create.  You are the KING of

negative energy.

ANDY

(thrown)

Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop!

Because if these bad vibes get

out... then everyone will be talkin'

about how sick I am, and it becomes

a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then

-- I'm dead.

GEORGE

So how can I help you...?

ANDY

I wanna go back to work and put on a

happy show.

(bright-eyed)

The best show anybody's ever seen!

GEORGE

Do you wanna tour the clubs?

ANDY

No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!

(beat)

Carnegie Hall...!

CUT TO:

REPORTER #1

I'm working on a great cover story:

I've got a guy in the lab at Cedars.

He says Andy Kaufman is dying of

lung cancer.

EDITOR

What bullshit!  No.  No more Kaufman

stories!  He's burned us too many

times!

REPORTER #2

Yeah, he's definitely not dying.

He's playing Carnegie Hall next

month!

REPORTER #1

Jesus.  Only Kaufman would use

cancer as a publicity stunt.

COWBOYS AND COWGIRLS

"I've got spurs

That jingle-jangle jingle..."

ANDY

This is great.  The crowd's gonna

love this!

(giddy; thinking)

Hey... do you still think any of

those cowgirls are still alive?

ZMUDA

I dunno.  If they were, they'd be

pushin' 80.

ANDY

Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get

one on the show.

(excited)

I want the evening to build and

build.  It's gonna have the most

incredible ending: Singers, dancers,

the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the

sky opens, and Santa Claus comes

flying down!

ZMUDA

And you say, "Santa, what am I

gettin' for Christmas?"  And he

says, "Cancer!"

ANDY

No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I

want this show to be positive!

GEORGE

That's great... but this show's

gonna cost a fortune.  Even if it

sells out, you'll still lose eighty

grand.

ANDY

I don't care about the money.  I

just want the show to deliver.

GEORGE

So who's gonna pay for it?

ANDY

Tony Clifton.

GEORGE

(beat)

You know Tony doesn't have that kind

of money.

ANDY

Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony

better than you do.  Even if he has

to work another ten years to pay it

off, he'll do it!

GEORGE

Okay, Andy.  Will do.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANDY

Abbu daba, abi abbu daba!  Abbu

(to the crowd)

Abbu dabbu da ba do...!

AUDIENCE

ABBU DABBU DA BA DO!!

ANDY

Ladies and Gentlemen!  I'm pleased

to announce that we have with us the

one surviving cowgirl from that 1931

film, Eleanor "Cody" Gould!!

ANDY (cont'd)

It's such an honor to have you here.

ELEANOR

(squinting into the

lights)

Andy... this is so overwhelming...

ANDY

Well, it's gettin' even better!

'Cause we found one of the original

hobby horses!  Do you -- do you

think you could treat us to a few

steps from "Jingle Jangle Jingle"?

ZMUDA

Is there a doctor in the house??!

ANDY

Ladies and Gentlemen, she's alive!

CHOIR (O.S.)

HALLELUJAH!  HALLELUJAH!

ANDY

Ladies and Gentlemen, the Mormon

Tabernacle Choir!!!

ANDY (cont'd)

Oh my gosh, it's the Rockettes!

ANDY (cont'd)

Girls and Boys, it's Santa Claus!!

ANDY (cont'd)

And it's not over yet!!  'Cause I'm

taking you all out to Milk and

Cookies!!

ANDY (cont'd)

I'm serious!!!!!!!

ANDY

Single file!  Don't rush!  There's

enough cookies for everyone!!

ANDY

I don't want this to ever end...

HEALER

Now we'll place a blue crystal.

Very high vibrations.  It's

wonderful for it's healing powers.

ANDY

(spellbound)

Okay.  Let's try two of those... and

one of the pink ones.

ADMINISTRATOR

Your friend is doing four crystal

sessions a day, but it's just not

helping.

ZMUDA

I know...

(beat)

The cancer's terminal.

ADMINISTRATOR

Yes.  That wasn't made particularly

clear to us when he checked in...

ZMUDA

(irked)

Look, personally, I think rubbing

rocks on people is a load of

horseshit.  But if it makes Andy

happy, that's all that matters.

ADMINISTRATOR

I'm sorry to sound crass -- but we

don't want to be "that health resort

in New Mexico where Andy Kaufman

died."

(beat)

I'm going to have to ask you to

leave.

ANDY

It's okay, Bob.  It wasn't really

working.

(a gentle smile)

We'll find something better.

LITTLE WENDY

What is this stuff?

LYNNE

It's all macrobiotic.  Millet,

burdock root, kelp... Andy says

it'll purify him.

TONY CLIFTON (O.S.)

What is that crap?  Looks like

somethin' my dog would puke up!!

TONY CLIFTON

How 'bout me and you dolls go get

some REAL food:  French fries and a

Porterhouse steak!

LYNNE

(not sure what to

say)

...Andy...?

TONY CLIFTON

I ain't Andy!  I'm Tony!  Andy's

sick -- pick, chick, kick, lick!

The doctor says he's a goner.

(rousing himself)

But Tony's built like a mule!  Andy

asked me to be his pallbearer!  I'll

do it for him!  I'm getting stronger

and stronger!  Here, watch this!

LYNNE

Stop it!  C'mon, put that down.

TONY CLIFTON

Yeah, you're right.  We better get

movin'.  We don't wanna miss Happy

Hour at Kelbos -- all the Mai Tai's

you can drink for $4.99.

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

Let's go!

(he starts SINGING

"New York, New

York")

"These vagabond blues,

Are washin' away.

I'll make a brand new start of

it..."

LYNNE AND LITTLE WENDY

Andy!!

TONY CLIFTON

Dammit...

CUT TO:

ANDY

I can't move my arm.

GEORGE

(awkwardly)

You've got good days and bad days.

ANDY

My hair is coming out.

GEORGE

(whispers)

Yeah...

ANDY

I've got an idea for a new TV show

for me to star in.  It's called

"Uncle Andy's Fun House" -- it'll be

a Saturday morning thing where I can

goof off with the kids.  You know,

puppets, magic tricks...

GEORGE

(long pause)

I think we can sell that.

ANDY

Hey... thanks for always backin' me.

GEORGE

Did your -- doctor say it's okay for

you to go back to work?

ANDY

Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he

had his way, I'd be stuck in the

hospital, running tests all day.

(beat)

And anyway, I've found a new guy

who's gonna be able to instantly

remove the cancer.

GEORGE

(startled)

Really?

ANDY

Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the

Philippines, and he's amazing!  He

rubs you and sucks the disease right

out!

GEORGE

The Philippines?  I dunno... Andy...

he sounds like one of your

characters.

ANDY

No... this guy's special.

(very sincere)

He performs miracles.

ANDY (cont'd)

He's my last chance.

CUT TO:

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

ANDY (ON FILM)

Well... My show is over.  I did my

best, and I just want to say, until

we meet again... please remember:

(he begins to SING)

"In this friendly, friendly world...

With each day so full of joy.

Why should any heart be lonely."

ANDY (ON FILM) (cont'd)

So everybody!  Put your arm around

the person next to you, even if you

don't like that person.  Come on!

(he resumes SINGING)

"The world is such a wonderful

place,

To wander through,

When you've got someone to love,

To wander along with you.

With the sky so full of stars,

And the river so full of songs,

Every heart should be so thankful,

Thankful for this friendly, friendly

world..."

GEORGE

It's a perfect Kaufman audience.

ZMUDA

Yeah.  They don't know whether to be

sad, or angry.

CAROL KANE

Why are people leaving?  The

curtain's gonna open.  Andy's gonna

come out... I know it!

TONY DANZA

Sure, the body was just made of

wax...!

(a very long beat)

Wasn't it......?

FADE OUT.

DUDE #2

Oh my GOD.

(stupefied)

That's the freakiest thing I've ever

seen!!  Look!

DUDE #1

Man, we were right!  He's not dead!

DUDE #2

He's just been lyin' low for a year!

WE GOTTA GO!

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Ladies and Gentlemen!  Please put

your hands together for... Tony

Clifton!

TONY CLIFTON

How ya doin'?

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

How you doin' back there?!

(to the front rows)

How you doin' up here?!

VOICE

Andy!

TONY CLIFTON

Don't know nothin' about no Andy.

Just some dead guy tryin' to ride my

coattails.

(to the BAND)

Let's HIT IT, boys!  One, two, anda

one two three four!

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

"First I was afraid

I was petrified.

Kept thinkin' I could never live

Without you at my side."

(he wipes away a

pretend tear)

"Were you the one that tried to

Hurt me with goodbye?

Did you think I'd crumble?

Did you think I'd lay down and

Die...?"

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

"Oh no not I!

I WILL SURVIVE!

As long as I know how to love,

I know I'll simply stay alive!"

TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)

"I've got all my life to live

I've got all my life to give.

I will survive..."

(he hits his big

finish)

"I -- WILL -- SURVIVE!!!"

FADE OUT.
