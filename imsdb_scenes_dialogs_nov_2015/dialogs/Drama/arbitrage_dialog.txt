MARIA (O.S.)

...but you took a huge bet on the

housing crisis in the middle of the

biggest boom anybody'd ever seen. Why?

ROBERT (O.S.)

I'm a child of the 50's. My father

welded steel for the Navy. And my

mother worked at the VA.

ROBERT

They lived through the Depression,

Pearl Harbor, and the Bomb. And they

didn't think bad things might

happen; they knew they would happen.

MARIA

Is that what's happening now?

ROBERT

When I was a kid my favorite

teacher was Mr. James. Mr. James

said that world events always

revolve around five things:

(extending his fingers one-

BY-ONE)

ROBERT

M-O-N-E-Y.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 2.

MARIA

(LAUGHING)

Was this freshman econ?

ROBERT

This was fifth-grade econ.

(smiles, off her laugh)

But this is something we've seen

over and over again, time and time

again, that competition for this--

limited amount of dollars out

there, can make even the best of us

manic. So it's not surprising that

we see these asset bubbles, but

when reality sets in of course,

they burst.

"ARBITRAGE"

BACK TO

ROBERT

GAVIN

(handing him the coffee)

Here you go...

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 3.

GAVIN (CONT'D)

(SITTING)

You're disappointed.

ROBERT

Quants? Derivatives structures?

What was that about?

GAVIN

It makes no sense.

ROBERT

That's what you said last week.

Why'd we go down there?

GAVIN

To sign.

ROBERT

And did we sign?

GAVIN

No.

ROBERT

No. We did not. Instead I fly two

thousand miles for a marketing

meeting... And where was Mayfield?

What was this "emergency"? What was

that about?

GAVIN

(after a beat)

Did you speak to the auditors?

ROBERT

Why?

GAVIN

What if... we don't don't close this

week...

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 4.

ELLEN

(LIGHTING UP)

Look, your grandfather's here!

ROBERT

Hi, guys!

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 5.

GRANDCHILD

Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?

BROOKE

It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.

You're spoiling them rotten.

ROBERT

(GRINNING)

It's my job! It's my job. You guys

turned out fine!

BROOKE

(HALF-SMILE)

Debatable.

ROBERT

(to Peter, as they hug and

SMILE)

How you doin', son? Good?

ELLEN

We had to eat. The kids were

starving...

ROBERT

(hugging her, happy)

No, no that's okay. Where's my

drink, is this mine, here?

ALL

HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!

ROBERT

Thank you, thank you, thank you all

very much, it's such a surprise, I

didn't even know it was my birthday!

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 6.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

What did Mark Twain say about? He

said-- old age... is clearly a case

of mind over matter. If you don't

mind, it doesn't matter.

(MORE LAUGHTER)

I've done a lot of things in my life,

worked very hard, but being here,

looking around-- at all these shining,

radiant faces, I know that my best

work is right here in this room, right

now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.

That's the best gift your mother and I

could have hoped for,

(KISSES ELLEN)

so, thank you...

PETER

(CALLING OUT)

...and to have sold the company

to Standard this morning!

ROBERT

(SMILES)

That, too, Peter, but- no business

tonight-- no business!

ELLEN

Oh, here we go!

ROBERT

Although your one-track mind assures

me you've got not only your mother's

genes, but you've got mine, too!

ROBERT (CONT'D)

Now, I'm aware that may seem

uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me

sixty years to realize what's truly

important -- and it's you guys so thank

you all very much.

ALL

(as they applaud)

Hear, hear!

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 7.

ROBERT

Kids are wild.

BROOKE

(LAUGHING)

I don't know about me as a mom.

ROBERT

No, no no, you should have-- I want

more "you's" around.

BROOKE

(LAUGHS)

It's all about you, isn't it.

(POINTS)

Four... and nineteen.

ROBERT

Yeah, yeah yeah...

BROOKE

So what was that all about?

ROBERT

What?

BROOKE

The last time you made a speech like that

we lost the Firestone bid.

ROBERT

(LAUGHS)

Yeah, well... I just... wanted it

to be about the family tonight.

BROOKE

You see this?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 8.

ROBERT

(shakes his head)

Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel

about that. Trash can.

BROOKE

Peter's got a copy pinned up in the

conference room.

ROBERT

(sits back, takes a drink)

Well, you gonna keep skirting around it?

BROOKE

Why sell our company? We make a

great return, we give money to the

causes we believe in...

ROBERT

My darling, you are still in your 20's.

I am 60. That's a big difference in

point of view.

BROOKE

Dad, you're not that old.

ROBERT

(LAUGHS)

It catches up alright. And maybe

there's some other things I'd like to

do. Maybe I would like to spend a

little more time with you guys...

outside the office.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

(GROWING IMPATIENT)

What?

BROOKE

(LAUGHS)

I'm just trying to imagine what we

would do.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 9.

ELLEN

Where are you going?

ROBERT

Office.

ELLEN

Now?

ROBERT

Yeah I gotta finish up that thing.

ELLEN

(SMILES)

But, I haven't given you your

birthday present yet...

ROBERT

(SMILING BACK)

I'll be back as soon as I can.

ROBERT

(into his phone)

Yeah, Gavin, it's me, uhh... When

you get this -- I want you to call

Chris Vogler at Fremaut, tell him I

need to see him right away, okay?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 10.

JULIE

(standing in frustration)

Okay...

ROBERT

Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm

late. I'm always late-- you know

that-- and I'm sorry. And I'm

always saying I'm sorry about being

late.

(crosses to her)

It doesn't mean I wouldn't rather

be here with you.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

The show's gonna be beautiful.

JULIE

(FINALLY--)

You gonna be there?

ROBERT

(slight beat, then

DEFINITIVE)

I will be there.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

(LAUGHING)

Oh wow, that's great.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 11.

JULIE

I made this for you.

ROBERT

You made this? This is amazing. One

candle, thank you very...

JEFFREY

Thank you, Diane.

JEFFREY (CONT'D)

So?

ROBERT

I'm here.

JEFFREY

Guess what's not?

ROBERT

Jeffrey, I told you, I'm...

JEFFREY

"...working on it," yeah. Well, while

you're doing that, lemme tell you what's

not working...

ROBERT

(LEANING FORWARD)

Jeffrey...

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 12.

JEFFREY

(LOUDER)

...what's not working is my four

hundred twelve million dollars that's

sitting in your account so you can

pass your audit, the four hundred

twelve million that you needed, you

said, for two weeks, and which has

been languishing now for

(looks down at paper)

thirty-two days, while it could be

elsewhere invested, earning an actual

return, instead of couching the absurd

lie that you're spinning.

ROBERT

What do you want me to say?

JEFFREY

That you're gonna get a signature

from Mayfield, and that my hostage

money and my fee are going to be sent

to me promptly, say... by tomorrow?

ROBERT

I am solving the problem. I am getting

you your money and your fee. You will

have them very shortly.

JEFFREY

When?

ROBERT

As soon as they sign the contract.

JEFFREY

(BEAT)

You know, I'm not the one with the

liability, pal. I just made a loan.

You're looking at jail for a

thousand years for fraudulent

conveyance and...

ROBERT

...Stop it! You don't have to talk

to me like that!...

JEFFREY

I didn't get you into this mess!

ROBERT

You were a friend of mine!...

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 13.

JEFFREY

...remember when you asked me if it

was a good idea to divert half your

liquid assets into a fucking copper

mine? What did I tell you?

ROBERT

(stands, heading to door

WITH COAT)

Are we done here? I think we're

done here.

JEFFREY

(MATTER-OF-FACT)

Friday morning I take my money back.

ROBERT

(SHAKES HEAD)

You can't do that...

JEFFREY

...the fuck I can't, it's in an escrow bill

with one-day call rights...

ROBERT

...I need the money there until they

sign, Jeffrey. What if they check again?

JEFFREY

That's really not my problem, is it?

ROBERT

(stares, fumes)

Not your fuckin problem...

ROBERT

(TO RAMON)

Let's go.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 14.

CNBC ANNOUNCER

The DOW continues its uptick this

morning on new housing starts to

rise 132 points. Asian markets fared

less well, especially in Russia,

where further nationalization plans

caused foreign investment to

sputter, leading to various...

ROBERT

(BARKS)

What?

GAVIN (O.S.)

Seven-thirty tonight at the Four Seasons.

We'll get it straight with Mayfield then.

ROBERT

(calming a little)

Good. Very good.

ROBERT

Is this too blue?

ELLEN

It's the third one you've tried.

ROBERT

Ay, yay yay. I look old.

ELLEN

You look regal, and wise, and granted

a little worried. What is going on?

Are you afraid of this meeting?

ROBERT

They haven't signed the papers.

ELLEN

I thought that's why you flew down there.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 15.

ROBERT

(rubbing his eyes)

So did I, but for some reason

they're stalling. I didn't get any

sleep on the plane and...

ELLEN

Now come on. It will all work out.

Just follow the plan.

ROBERT

What plan is that?

ELLEN

"Confidence equals contract."

ROBERT

(LAUGHS)

You sound like a fortune cookie.

ELLEN

They're your words, actually.

ROBERT

Then you married an idiot.

ELLEN

(BEAT)

Okay, but I was thinking, idiot,

that, after the deal is done, which

it definitely will be, why don't we

just take off? Pete's in the best

place he's ever been, your daughter

is always as brilliant, right? So,

I wanna have some fun. I wanna have

fun with you!

ELLEN (CONT'D)

Let's go to Ravello- the house there.

We haven't been there forever..

ROBERT

(GROWING UNCOMFORTABLE)

There hasn't been time.

ELLEN

We have to make time. We go for a

year. Let's take a year and get fat

and have fun and go on an adventure. I

mean-- seriously-- how much money do

we need?. Do you wanna be the richest

guy in the cemetery?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 16.

ROBERT

I don't wanna be in the cemetery!

ELLEN

Oh, by the way, Mary called from St.

Victor's Hospital, again, she said they

still haven't gotten the check yet...

ROBERT

I'm taking care of it.

ELLEN

The gala is Friday. Should I be

selling my ring? What's going on?

ROBERT

I've had to move some things around

for the merger.

ELLEN

It's only two million.

ROBERT

(walks up to her, laughs)

Only two million?

ELLEN

(SMILES)

Yeah!

ROBERT

You remember-- Riccio's? Full meals...

two bucks... all you can eat... three

bucks...

ELLEN

I do remember. But I do not

remember you being so sentimental

unless you were trying to change

the subject.

ROBERT

(as he heads out, smiling)

I don't know what you're talking

about...

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 17.

MAITRE'D

Mr. Miller, good to see you, sir.

Your party has already arrived.

ROBERT

(sotto, to Gavin)

Where the hell is Mayfield?

BARNES

(as they sit)

Mr. Miller, thank you for coming.

We were just getting acquainted

with Brooke and Peter here.

ROBERT

(SMILING)

I hope they didn't beat you up

too much.

AIMES

They've been terrific.

PETER

Dad, we've been talking about operations.

Tim thinks once we consolidate we can save

about fifty percent on our back-office.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 18.

ROBERT

I'd love to hear about that, but...

(A BEAT)

I had thought Mr. Mayfield planned to

join us tonight.

AIMES

(NODS)

Jim should be here in twenty minutes; he

suggested we get right into details.

BARNES

I was just telling Brooke: now that

we can market your quants' track

records, we have access to a host of

new capital that...

DISSOLVE TO:

BARNES

...assuming we shed debt through some

small liquidations, I'd say...

ROBERT

I'm sorry, gentlemen, we've been here

nearly two hours now. Where is Mr.

Mayfield?

AIMES

He just texted me. He's very sorry,

but he's been detained.

ROBERT

Detained where?

ROBERT (CONT'D)

(RISING)

Alright, I think I can leave you with

my family?

BARNES

Of course. Again, Mr. Miller, a privilege.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 19.

ROBERT

Yeah, yeah yeah.

BROOKE

(INDICATING)

Dad...

GAVIN

(TO AIMES)

This is the bullshit way you try to

close a deal?

AIMES

Port? Would you like to have some port?

BROOKE

Did you get my message?

ROBERT

No. What's up?

BROOKE

We need to sit down.

ROBERT

What is it?

BROOKE

I don't want to talk about it here.

ROBERT

(SHARP)

BROOKE--

BROOKE

I found some strange entries in the

"Old Hill" books.

ROBERT

What kind of entries?

BROOKE

I'm not sure yet, but there's

definitely something off.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 20.

ROBERT

Alright, come by about eleven

tomorrow and we'll look at it then.

And Brooke?

BROOKE

Yeah.

ROBERT

See if you can find out what

happened to Mayfield.

EXT. JULIE COTE GALLERY - A LITTLE LATER

Robert exits his MAYBACH in front of a big scene in progress:

trendy FOLKS overflowing into the street, cameras FLASHING...

INT. GALLERY - CONTINUOUS

The space is cavernous, modern luxe -- a Liagre design with

thirty-foot columns and slab granite. The ART COLLECTION on

display is indeed beautiful- photo-realist paintings -- and

each one tells a strange story.

Robert enters and scans the room. No Julie. He approaches the

gallery ASSISTANT.

ROBERT

How're they doing?

ASSISTANT

Great. Everyone loves them.

ROBERT

Yeah, but how are they doing?

ASSISTANT

So-so.

He scans the party further. No Julie.

ROBERT

Where's Julie?

ASSISTANT

She's in the back.

INT. GALLERY - OFFICE IN BACK - CONTINUOUS

We pick up on Julie bumping two rails of COCAINE.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 21.

ROBERT

Hey, Julie.

JULIE

Oh...

(to the group)

This is Robert Miller, one of our

collectors. This Katrina Stanton, and

Alex Stanton and their daughter Ava,

who is a talented young artist.

ROBERT

Oh, really? Painter?

AVA

Drawings.

ROBERT

(LOOKING AROUND)

Yeah, that's great.

(as he notices Julie

leave, to the group)

(MORE)

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 22.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

I like the size of the paintings, I wanna talk

to you about them in a second.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

What? Why are you doing this?

JULIE

Go -- away.

ROBERT

I will take

(POINTING)

those two. And the Rubik's cube on

the back wall.

ASSISTANT

(pointing to list)

Right there, number seven.

ROBERT

Don't tell her it was me.

(off her nod)

I mean it.

ASSISTANT

You got it.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 23.

PAINTER

...fucking Dalwood wouldn't know a Van

Gogh from a Van Eyck. And they call it

a "State of Contemporism..."

JULIE

(INTO PHONE)

Who's this?

ROBERT (O.S.)

It's me.

JULIE

What do you want?

ROBERT (O.S.)

I'm here.

JULIE

Where?

ROBERT

I'm in your bedroom. Can you get

those people out of here?

JULIE

Are you serious?

ROBERT

Look down the hall. Do you see me?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 24.

JULIE

(LOOKING)

I see you.

ROBERT

Okay, so I'm serious.

JULIE

You just come in and out whenever

you want?

ROBERT

I thought we should talk...

JULIE

(laughs, then in a rage)

One damn night in a month I told

you was important to me, et tu es

meme pas capable d'etre la...

ROBERT

...I was working, do you

understand? I'm under enormous

pressure, I have obligations...

JULIE

...I don't want to hear about your

obligations. If you cared -- YOU

WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!

ROBERT

I was there! I was there! I was

late, but I was there. And I'm

here now.

JULIE

No, no, no. You're here when it's

convenient for you to be here.

C'est pas ca l'amour. Love means

YOU FUCKING SHOW UP!

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 25.

LIVING ROOM

ROBERT

I'm sorry.

JULIE

Why did you buy those paintings?

ROBERT

Because I liked them.

JULIE

Okay, thank you for helping me get

started. But if I'm gonna fail--

then let me fail!

ROBERT

Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why

would you fail?

ROBERT (CONT'D)

You know, I'm not the kinda guy who

wants to throw money away but if

you wanna start a business, you

have to project a certain image.

JULIE

What image?

ROBERT

Success.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

The market's a disaster right now;

nobody's moving anything. That's

why you gotta show sales. People

look at you then and they say

"Whoah, how'd she do that?" -- and

that's what they remember. Always.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 26.

JULIE

(QUIETLY)

You're never gonna leave her.

CUT TO:

BEDROOM

ROBERT

Come away with me. Let's just take

your car and go...

JULIE

...Where?...

ROBERT

There's a place upstate. Very

beautiful, on the water. We can

wake up there together- just you

and me. I'd like that.

JULIE

Me, too.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 27.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 28.

ROBERT

(INTO PHONE)

Yes, I wanna make it collect...

OPERATOR

Your name, sir?

ROBERT

Lawrence Grant.

JIMMY (O.S.)

Who the fuck is this?

ROBERT

Jimmy, it's me.

JIMMY (O.S.)

Robert?

ROBERT

I want you to listen to me very

closely...

BRYER

You gotta be fucking kidding me.

MILLS

Catching detective wants us to rule

before he calls it.

BRYER

We've been having the same fuckin'

argument for twenty years.

(MORE)

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 29.

BRYER (CONT'D)

They can't handle one drunk

motorist kills herself?

MILLS

I'm not so sure about this...

MILLS (CONT'D)

Car roll had multiple impacts, but

she was here

(POINTS)

and her feet

(POINTS)

were down there.

BRYER

... So who kicked out the door?

ROBERT

Let's go.

JIMMY

You gonna tell me what this is?

ROBERT

It's better you don't ask.

JIMMY

So all you're sayin' is, you need a

ride somewhere.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 30.

ROBERT

JIMMY

ROBERT

JIMMY

JIMMY

ROBERT

JIMMY

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 31.

ROBERT

What'd you say?

JIMMY

I told her I had to run out a minute.

ROBERT

Do you trust her?

JIMMY

Is this the kinda shit you used to

do to my dad?

ROBERT

Do you trust her?

JIMMY

Yes, I fucking trust her!

ROBERT

Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

home. My wife gets up at five am for

Pilates -- I will be there next to

her, where I've been all night. And

you'll do the same with yours.

JIMMY

This is some pretty fucked up shit.

ROBERT

Jimmy...

JIMMY

No, man, come on, I don't hear from

you since the fuckin' funeral, you

call me up out of the blue, using

my father's name, ask me...

ROBERT

...what do you want, you want

money? I will give you five

thousand dollars! I will give you

ten thousand dollars! I'll give you

whatever you fuckin'...

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 32.

JIMMY

You wanna talk to me like that you

can get the fuck outta my car and

you can walk! You want that?! You

wanna fuckin' walk home?!

ROBERT

(after a beat)

Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not

myself. I need your help.

JIMMY

You alright?

JIMMY (CONT'D)

Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.

ROBERT

No, I just... have to get home...

I'll deal with it in a couple of

hours.

JIMMY

What if you don't make it a couple

of hours?

ROBERT

Then I don't make it.

JIMMY

(through the window)

Call me, alright, and let me know

it's okay.

ROBERT

(as he exits)

Better we don't talk for a while.

JIMMY

(can't believe it--

through the window)

So what you get in a bind and just

call up the only nigger you know?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 33.

ROBERT

I'm sorry, Jimmy. I really am. Just

go home.

JIMMY

Yeah, alright, man. Take care of that.

SERVANT

Everything okay, sir?

ROBERT

I'm fine, Glen. Go back to bed.

ELLEN

(HALF-ASLEEP)

Where did you go?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 34.

ROBERT

What?

ELLEN

(DREAMY)

I woke up for a minute, you weren't

here...

ROBERT

I just went to... eat some ice cream.

ELLEN

Was it good?

ROBERT

(pained, shifting his body)

Yes...

ELLEN

Good. Don't forget to take your Lipitor in

the morning...

ROBERT

Ellen...

ELLEN

What?

ROBERT

Do you still love me?

ELLEN

Of course I do...

SYD

Hypothetically, the situation

you're describing would be

involuntary manslaughter.

ROBERT

And such a person...

SYD

...would be in a lot of trouble,

especially if that person was closing

a merger with a large public bank

where any publicity or arrest could

delay or derail the transaction.

(MORE)

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 35.

SYD (CONT'D)

But that's only if there was some

evidence that could link him to

the crime.

ROBERT

Fingerprints, DNA?

SYD

Very hard to collect after an explosion.

The real world's different from television.

ROBERT

What about cell phone records?

SYD

Did this person make any calls from the area?

ROBERT

Not from a cell phone, no.

SYD

Then they won't be able to place him there.

ROBERT

What would you advise such a person

to do?

SYD

To confess immediately.

ROBERT

Failing which?

SYD

To put as much distance between himself

and the event as possible, if possible.

But let me tell you something, and I'm

speaking to you as a friend now: there

are about fifty things that person

wouldn't have thought of. And the more

time that passes, the more lies that

are told, the worse it gets for him.

SYD (CONT'D)

(FRENCH ACCENT)

Robert...

ROBERT

Yeah.

SYD

They're going to come to you.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 36.

ROBERT

I know.

SYD

An accident's not the worst

trouble. If we talk to them now we

can probably work it out.

ROBERT

You tell me what happens if the

Standard deal does not close, and I

gotta tell my investors about our

real losses?

SYD

Nothing good.

ROBERT

And what'd you say about the Justice

Department? Depending on what they

decide to arrest me on-- fraud

conviction gets me twenty years?

SYD

I did.

ROBERT

(laughs in pain)

What choice do I really have?

CHRIS

You're aware Congress plans to

extend the audit requirements for

private funds.

ROBERT

Of course I am aware. I gave

testimony to the committee.

(ZEROING IN)

You know this.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 37.

CHRIS

Well, Standard wants to prepare for

it now. So I was asked to go through

every one of your trading books and

reconfirm their assets.

ROBERT

No. Absolutely not. That's impossible.

CHRIS

Don't worry. I put the team on

different books and I left "Old

Hill" for myself.

(SMILES)

Anyway, I'm here to tell you-- I

cleared it.

ROBERT

The audit's cleared?

CHRIS

The report will be issued today.

Actually, I'm calling it my "swan song."

ROBERT

You're leaving?

CHRIS

Yeah, on Friday, it's a five-year clock.

ROBERT

(EXACERBATED)

And why?

CHRIS

Uhh.. To prevent exactly what we're

doing. But honestly, there's nothing

left to worry about. It's -- great.

ROBERT

(TO CHRIS)

Get out.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

(INTO PHONE)

What?

GAVIN (O.S.)

How was it?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 38.

ROBERT

What?

GAVIN (O.S.)

The show.

ROBERT

What the fuck are you talking about?

GAVIN (O.S.)

The show, Julie's show?

ROBERT

Oh... Oh, it was fine...

GAVIN (O.S.)

Mayfield's here.

ROBERT

He's here? Where?

GAVIN (O.S.)

Sherry Netherland. Checked in about an

hour ago.

ROBERT

He called?

GAVIN (O.S.)

No, Brooke has a friend on the

executive committee who said he's

taking meetings in his room...

(NO RESPONSE)

Maybe he's settling in.

ROBERT

You think we're dealing with a

fucking idiot?

GAVIN (O.S.)

(BEAT)

I spoke to legal. They said Standard will

sign once they get the audit report.

ROBERT

That's being issued now.

GAVIN (O.S.)

How do you know that?

ROBERT

Never mind that, just find out why

Mayfield hasn't called us.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 39.

GAVIN (O.S.)

How am I...?

ROBERT

Do I have to do every Goddamn thing

myself? JUST FIND OUT! WILL YOU

PLEASE...? THANK YOU!

BROOKE

I cannot reconcile it...

ROBERT

Reconcile what?

BROOKE

The "Old Hill" Fund. Dad, are you

listening to me?

ROBERT

Of course I'm listening.

(SITS FORWARD)

Okay, those trades are in the special

book. They don't get audited on the

same balance sheet.

BROOKE

Yeah, but look at the sheet! It

can't be right. There's a four

hundred million dollar hole here. I

mean that can't be right.

RECEPTIONIST

May I help you?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 40.

BRYER

Detective Bryer. I was hoping to

see Mr. Miller.

CINDY

Is he expecting you?

BRYER

Possibly.

BROOKE

...the way that this sheet reads, half

of the fund's assets are missing.

ROBERT

(LAUGHS)

That's ridiculous. That can't be right.

BROOKE

I know, it's ridiculous, and yet...

ROBERT

Okay, I'll look into it. I promise

you I'll look into it.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

(INTO PHONE)

Yeah.

CINDY (O.S.)

There's a detective Bryer here to

see you?

ROBERT

(stiffens, then into phone)

Give me two minutes, then send him in...

BROOKE

Everything alright?

ROBERT

Yes, my other meeting just got here

early. We'll have to pick this up later.

BROOKE

Okay. And Mom wants to know about

the hospital check?

ROBERT

Brooke, we'll pick it up later, alright?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 41.

BROOKE

Okay.

CINDY (O.S.)

Detective Bryer, hi, I'm Cindy, Mr.

Miller's personal assistant, right

this way.

ROBERT

Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you

waiting. You can sit there. We just

heard about it. Really terrible.

BRYER

Okay, so you were an investor in

her gallery?

ROBERT

Correct.

BRYER

How'd you meet her?

ROBERT

Through... I think it was a charity

function. My wife and I have a foundation.

BRYER

Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?

ROBERT

Last night, at the gallery.

BRYER

Did you stay till the doors closed?

ROBERT

No, I think I left about ten.

BRYER

Where'd you go?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 42.

ROBERT

Home.

BRYER

You go straight home?

ROBERT

Yeah.

BRYER

You stay home?

ROBERT

Yeah.

BRYER

(SMILES)

Your wife home?

ROBERT

(SMILES BACK)

Yes.

BRYER

Okay. Okay, so now, back to the

gallery. Did you see her with anyone?

ROBERT

See her with anyone-- what do you

mean?

BRYER

You know like a boyfriend, someone

she might've left with?

ROBERT

Not that I noticed. No. No, no.

BRYER

Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

located the driver.

ROBERT

The driver?

BRYER

Yeah, someone else was driving.

(BEAT)

Sometimes, the driver, will go for

help-- and he'll die tryin', you

know...

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 43.

STANDS)

Well that seems to make sense.

(BEAT)

So we're all good with the

apartment, then?

ROBERT

Sure.

BRYER

Thanks.

BRYER (CONT'D)

What happened to your head?

ROBERT

What?

BRYER

That's a nasty cut; I've been

looking at that for the last five

minutes. Does it hurt you?

ROBERT

(touching the cut)

Oh, no, I just hit it on the

medicine cabinet.

BRYER

Last night?

ROBERT

This morning.

BRYER

Hate when that happens.

ROBERT

Yeah. Me, too.

BRYER

Well, thanks for the chat.

ROBERT

No problem.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 46.

MAE

(INTO PHONE)

Ellen Miller's office...

ELLEN

(INTO PHONE)

And it, it transformed them, seriously.

MAE

(SOFTLY)

There's a Detective Bryer in the lobby.

ELLEN

(INTO PHONE)

And thanks again for your

generosity. Alright, we'll see you

then. Thank you, bye.

(hanging up, to Mae)

I'm sorry, what?

MAE

Detective Bryer.

ELLEN

What does he want?

MAE

I don't know.

ELLEN

(heading to the door)

Well, I'm late so-- I just can't

deal with it right now.

MAE

Okay, what about these?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 47.

ELLEN

Send them a thank you note, Zappos has

been so generous-- Thanks, bye guys.

BRYER

(calling after her)

Mrs. Miller?

ELLEN

(STARTLED)

Yes?

BRYER

(shows his badge)

Detective Bryer.

ELLEN

Did you just call my office?

BRYER

Yeah, I was hoping to talk to you.

ELLEN

Well, I don't have time right now,

sorry..

BRYER

(turning on the charm)

Just take a couple a seconds. It's

about your husband.

ELLEN

Well, fine, but, make an appointment.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 48.

MILLS

How'd it go?

BRYER

Well, the wife blew me off-- which

was interesting. And he didn't

admit to the affair, but then he

wouldn't, would he?

MILLS

Why didn't you pick him up?

BRYER

He's a very rich man. What happened

with the pay phones?

MILLS

Got about fifteen calls in a three-

mile. Two of `em look a little

strange: got an incoming-- that's

probably a local drug deal...

BRYER

And the one we care about?

MILLS

Collect call. About a minute and a

half. Made from the Chevron station

on West Lake Road.

BRYER

Who'd he call?

MILLS

Cellphone in Harlem. Still waiting

on the address.

BRYER

(thinks, gets up and

PACES)

So, you're at the crash site.

Alright, and... you make it outta

the car. Now... You're smart

enough not to use your own

cellphone. So you get to the pay

phone...

(MORE)

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 49.

BRYER (CONT'D)

and you're a billionaire, right?

You're a billionaire-- so whaddya

do...?

(Mills shrugs for the

PUNCHLINE)

You call someone in Harlem?

GAVIN

(out of breath)

Robert, I just heard about Julie...

I'm so sorry. Her Gallery called.

Her mom's flying in today.

ROBERT

(managing a nod)

Her Mom...? Service here?

GAVIN

Tomorrow at nine am.

ROBERT

Well we should pick up the expenses

for that. Whatever she wants.

You'll take care of that

personally, for me?

GAVIN

(NODDING)

Of course... Are you okay?

ROBERT

You reach Mayfield?

GAVIN

Not yet, but we'll get him...

(STARES)

Robert, I...

ROBERT

Thanks. Appreciate your concern.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 50.

MILLS

Let's flash him.

MILLS

Mr. Grant?

JIMMY

Yes?

MILLS

NYPD Homicide, would you mind

stepping into the car?

JIMMY

What's this about?

BRYER

(through the window)

Just get in the car, Jimmy.

JIMMY

Am I under arrest?

BRYER

(through the window)

You wanna be?

BRYER

So let's do this again.

JIMMY

Man, for what? My answers ain't

gonna change.

BRYER

You were asleep.

JIMMY

Right.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 51.

BRYER

And your phone rings.

JIMMY

Right.

BRYER

And it's a wrong number.

BRYER (CONT'D)

Why do you accept the charges on a

collect call from a wrong number?

JIMMY

I don't think I wanna answer any

more questions.

BRYER

And you stay on the phone a minute and

a half on a wrong number? What the

fuck do you talk about, area codes?

JIMMY

I want to talk to my lawyer.

MILLS

Listen, kid, we know you went out

there. We ID'd your photo with your

neighbor who saw you getting into

your truck ten minutes after this

call was made.

JIMMY

Well if you got all that, what the

fuck you need me for, officer?

BRYER

I don't think you understand the

gravity of the situation here,

Jimmy. This is a homicide.

JIMMY

Lawyer.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 52.

ROBERT

You're gonna sign him out?

SYD

I called in Earl Monroe.

ROBERT

The basketball player?

SYD

Civil rights attorney. You remember

Crown Heights?

ROBERT

He's the best?

SYD

He's the best above 96th Street- and

that doesn't make him any cheaper.

ROBERT

You've gotta get Jimmy out of this.

SYD

It might not be that easy. If he

doesn't cooperate they're likely to

indict him on obstruction.

ROBERT

What would he be looking at?

SYD

Hard to say. With his prior... Five

years, maybe ten.

BRYER

(TO JIMMY)

This is not going to go away.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 53.

EARL

I'll call you tomorrow if there's any

news. Don't worry about anything. And

don't talk to anyone else. You take care.

ROBERT

Come on, get in.

JIMMY

All you said was you wanted a

fucking ride! You didn't tell me

you killed that girl!

ROBERT

Jimmy...

JIMMY

I'm trying to put my life back

together. Okay, I appreciate you

helped us, but now you're pushing

it too far.

ROBERT

It's gonna be okay.

JIMMY

Like it was your ass sitting in

there? Like you know a fucking

thing about how it's gonna be?

ROBERT

We've got you the best criminal lawyer--

JIMMY

--Don't you got your own son for this?

Why the hell you didn't call him?

ROBERT

Cause he woulda fucked it up, okay?

JIMMY

Well I'm sorry your son's a fuckin'

idiot, but that ain't my fault.

SYD

This isn't productive.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 54.

JIMMY

Oh, okay. So tell us then, Syd,

what happens now?

SYD

We meet with Earl and we go from

there. I understand that right now

they don't have enough to charge

you with anything.

ROBERT

Your under suspicion.

JIMMY

Under suspicion? Motherfucker, I'm Black!

ROBERT

I am aware of that.

JIMMY

And what exactly would you like me

to do about it?

SYD

(BUZZING the driver)

Gentlemen, my driver will take you

where you wanna go, but I cannot be

a party to this conversation, so

this is where I get out...

JIMMY

Why couldn't you have just stayed?

ROBERT

I couldn't.

JIMMY

Why not?

ROBERT

Because I have responsibilities.

And if I stayed there, a lot of

people would've been hurt.

JIMMY

Somebody was hurt.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 55.

ROBERT

Other people, Jimmy. I've got business

troubles, you understand...? People

rely on me.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

Listen... I want to talk to you a second.

Come here. I wanna show you something.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

Now, you know, your father asked me

to look after you.

JIMMY

Yeah.

ROBERT

Yeah, I know I messed up, alright?

I'm sorry. But I do want to help

you, you know that.

(handing Jimmy the folder)

So I've been able to set up a

situation for you.

JIMMY

What's that?

ROBERT

It's a trust. In your name, assets

of $2 Million dollars. Take a look

at that.

JIMMY

(ASTOUNDED)

Are you serious? You think money's

gonna fix this?

ROBERT

What else is there?

JIMMY

(to the driver)

Yo, yo man, pull over.

ROBERT

(stares at him)

What are you gonna do?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 56.

JIMMY

I look like a fucking snitch to you?

ROBERT

I don't know, Jimmy. I don't know.

Are you?

ROBERT (CONT'D)

Wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Just--

read it. Just take it home and read

it. It's not gonna hurt you.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

(AGITATED)

What?

CINDY (O.S.)

I've got Chris Vogler from Fremaut

accounting, you asked me to

interrupt you.

ROBERT

Yeah, put him through...

(he hears Chris come on)

Chris...

CHRIS (O.S.)

Robert, I've run into some problems.

We're doing a "non-recommend."

ROBERT

(BEWILDERED)

What...?

CHRIS (O.S.)

They got compliance involved. I'm sorry.

ROBERT

Chris...

CHRIS (O.S.)

I've gotta go.

ROBERT

Chris? CHRIS! Goddamnit, Chris!

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 57.

BROOKE

(INTO PHONE)

Peter...? I'm looking at some

statements right now... How much

did you book last quarter?... No,

I'm not... No, Peter, I'm really

just asking you...

BROOKE (CONT'D)

(INTO PHONE)

Thirty-five million. For your

entire group, right?... It wasn't

sixty-eight?... Of course it's a

big number... No, I'm not... Oh,

Peter I'll talk to you later .

BEN

What are you doing in my office?

BEN (CONT'D)

Hello?

BROOKE

(holding up pages)

Can you explain these?

BEN

Explain what?

BROOKE

Old Hill. All the numbers you've falsified.

BEN

(BEAT)

You don't know what you're saying.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 58.

Brooke nods, heads to the door. Ben put his arm on her

shoulder to stop her.

BROOKE

Get out of my way.

BEN

Brooke...

BROOKE

You're hurting my arm.

BEN

Can't you just leave it alone?

She stares at him. He drops his arm. She exits and turns.

BROOKE

You're fired, Ben.

BEN

You can't fire me.

BROOKE

I just did.

BEN

Who do you think asked me to make

those changes?

She stares, then approaches him.

BROOKE

INT. POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Bryer and Mills sit with Flores as he stares at a SHEET.

MILLS

He was doing a little dealing a while

back, but it looks like he stopped.

FLORES

Any family?

BRYER

Nah, they're all dead.

FLORES

(READING)

So he's a good student, magnet

school, whatever.

(MORE)

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 59.

FLORES (CONT'D)

Then his mom dies and he gets

popped for gun possession. Even so,

how come he got probation?

BRYER

Well, he had an excellent lawyer.

FLORES

(READING CLOSER)

How the fuck does this kid afford

Felder and Chausse...?

BRYER

We pulled his parents' tax returns.

Guess where his father worked for

twenty years?

FLORES

(READING)

Miller Capital?

(READING)

He was the fucking driver?!

(LAUGHS)

Wow, this guy's good...

FLORES (CONT'D)

Where are you at with the kid?

MILLS

So far he won't budge.

FLORES

Well he's a convicted felon. Go get

a warrant, put him in front of a

grand jury. Let's see how long he

holds out when he realizes he's

looking at ten years off the prior.

SECRETARY

I'm sorry, Mr. Miller, as I

explained from downstairs, he's on

a call right now, and he said...

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 60.

SECRETARY (CONT'D)

Mr. Miller!

CHRIS

What the fuck...?

ROBERT

Tell me what is going on.

CHRIS

I can't.

ROBERT

Tell me what's going on!

CHRIS

I can't!

ROBERT

Why not?!

CHRIS

It's not me!

ROBERT

What do you mean it's not...?

CHRIS

THE AUDIT PASSED!

ROBERT

(slackening his grip)

The audit passed? What do you mean

the audit passed?

CHRIS

It passed! It passed a week ago!

Like I said. Everything's fine! We

confirmed the money, it's all

straight and done.

ROBERT

(BEYOND CONFUSED)

Then... why did you tell me that

it didn't?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 61.

CHRIS

Because they asked me to hold it.

ROBERT

They? Who's they?

(thrashes him again)

Who is they?!

CHRIS

Mayfield.

ROBERT

(TO HIMSELF)

Mayfield?

CHRIS

What?

ROBERT

They're negotiating. He wants a

better price.

ROBERT

(INTO PHONE)

Sherry Netherland...? Yes, James

Mayfield, please...

(as he enters his car)

Mr. Mayfield... I think it's time

we had a talk.

DEFERLITO

...cause it's not gonna hold.

BRYER

The warrant doesn't need to hold.

It just needs to scare him into

giving up Miller.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 62.

DEFERLITO

What is it, Mike, you're stalled-

out mid-career so you're reaching

for a high-note? Who gives a fuck?

BRYER

This is about Judge Rittenband, isn't

it? It's cause he's running again?

DEFERLITO

You wanna cost the Judge his seat on a

profiling claim? Against Earl Monroe?

BRYER

(SWITCHING TACKS)

I'm getting a piece of new evidence

that'll seal it a hundred percent.

DEFERLITO

Good, then come back when you got it.

BRYER

I'll have it before you go in the

jury room... Look, Ray. We like

this kid. I don't wanna lose him.

Think about it: if we flip him, you

get Robert Miller. What's that

worth to Rittenband, and to you for

that matter...?

(HARD)

Twenty years, Ray. Twenty fucking

years, we watch these guys- they

out-lawyer us, they out-buy us. I'm

fucking sick of it. Where's the

consequence? The guy did it. He

does not get to walk just cause

he's on CNBC.

DEFERLITO

You better not fuck me.

BRYER

(INTO PHONE)

Yeah... I need a serious fuckin'

favor...

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 63.

CINDY

Brooke's waiting for you...

ROBERT

Did we have a meeting?

CINDY

No, but she looked upset.

ROBERT

(APPROACHING HER)

Sweetie, you okay? What's wrong?

ROBERT

You wanna sit?

BROOKE

I'll stand.

(as he sits)

Didn't you think I'd find out?

ROBERT

I did.

BROOKE

Then why didn't you tell me?

Everybody wins?

ROBERT

Yes.

BROOKE

If the company sells. If I lie for you.

ROBERT

You don't have to lie. You didn't

know about it.

BROOKE

(INCREDULOUS)

I'm the Chief Investment Officer of

this company. What do you think

they'll say at the depositions?

"She didn't know?" They'll take away

my brokerage license- failure to

supervise you -- my name in every

paper and blog while I visit your ass

in jail!

ROBERT

What did you want me to do? Did you

want me to let our investors go

bankrupt? Is that what you wanted?

For people to get really hurt?

BROOKE

What... gives you the audacity to

think you can make those decisions?

ROBERT

(STANDS)

Because it's my job!

BROOKE

No, it's illegal. It's illegal. And

I am your partner.

ROBERT

You are not my partner! You work for me!

(off her bewildered stare)

That's right. You work for me!

(SITS)

Everybody works for me!

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 67.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

Brooke. Brooke. Come here. Please?

Please. Just, just come here. Just

for a second and sit down.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

(DEEP SIGH)

There's something I wanna tell you.

And whatever you decide I won't

blame you...

(she turns to look at him)

I'm on my own path. It's up to you

to move with it or against it. But

I'm the patriarch; that's my role.

And I have to play it.

BROOKE

(stares a while, then)

For a moment I thought you were

gonna say you were sorry.

ROBERT

(SOTTO)

I'm sorry.

JIMMY

(SEEING BRYER)

Oh, man, what?

BRYER

Jimmy, take a ride with me.

JIMMY

Where? Back to the station?

BRYER

No man, just get in the car.

JIMMY

What if I say no?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 68.

BRYER

I'm not threatening you. I'm just

asking you -- take a ride with me.

JIMMY

Alright, man, what?

BRYER

Look, it's pretty fuckin' simple. I

know you went to pick him up.

JIMMY

This is what you wanna talk about? I told

you I ain't makin' no more statements.

BRYER

And I know why.

JIMMY

Somebody cares?

BRYER

Take a look at this.

(hands him a case folder)

I've got his phone calls, I got his text

messages. I've got the relationship with

the girl. And they were fucking, by the

way.

(BEAT)

And then I've got you. I've got the time

log from the pay phone. I've a got a

fucking tollbooth photograph of you

driving your car through the Triborough.

JIMMY

Where you got that...? That's

bullshit, cause I didn't do it.

That's impossible.

BRYER

Really?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 69.

BRYER (CONT'D)

You lied to me. You lied to the

police. You obstructed justice.

JIMMY

Talk to Earl, Detective.

BRYER

Fuck Earl! You see this?

(holds up the grand jury

DOCKET)

This means that tomorrow, grand

jury hears your case in court. And

tomorrow in court I'm gonna ask for

a felony obstruction indictment,

and with with your prior, you are

going to prison for fifteen fucking

years... You might get out in ten.

You'll be what then? Thirty-three,

with no job, no girl, no life.

BRYER (CONT'D)

Look: I know you think Miller's

your friend.

JIMMY

Who's Miller?

BRYER

I know about your father.

JIMMY

(beat, then hard)

You don't know a Goddamn thing

about my father.

BRYER

I know Miller paid his bills while

he was dying. I know he got Syd

Felder to get you out of trouble on

your gun charge. That doesn't add

up to this.

JIMMY

You done?

BRYER

Okay, he's driving, he crashes- he

runs away- who does he call? Calls

you. Why do you think that is?

(SHORT BEAT)

(MORE)

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 70.

BRYER (CONT'D)

`Cause you're disposable- you're

the one person he could call that

just doesn't fuckin' matter. You're

a- you're a throwaway. You're just

another part of his transaction.

JIMMY

(tries to open the locked door)

Will you open the door?

BRYER

So what, what? You're his new

nigger now?

JIMMY

Open-- OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!

BRYER

You didn't kill that girl. He did.

JIMMY

(containing his rage)

Will you -- open -- the door?

BRYER

He's using you. I know it - you

know it. Do the right thing. Now

get outta my fuckin' car.

SYD

He's gonna walk.

ROBERT

You're certain?

SYD

Courts aren't for certainty, but he

says he was at home, why shouldn't

he be? A phone call doesn't make

him a liar.

(off Robert's nod)

But what's baffling to me, though,

despite your sentimental history

together, is why you would put your

family's future in this kid's hands.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 71.

ROBERT

(BEAT)

He's not like us.

SYD

Is that a good thing?

ROBERT

(laughs, plays with his

SCOTCH GLASS)

I don't know.

SYD

How's Ellen?

ROBERT

She's good. Fine.

(stops packing, looks up)

Why?

SYD

I heard something...

ROBERT

Yes...?

SYD

She met with Gil Deuchman.

ROBERT

The estate lawyer?

SYD

Yeah. Has she mentioned anything?

ROBERT

Not to me.

DEFERLITO

That was the early morning of April 11th.

JIMMY

Yes.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 72.

DEFERLITO

You received a phone call?

JIMMY

Yes.

DEFERLITO

Who called you?

JIMMY

It was a wrong number.

DEFERLITO

That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant?

JIMMY

No.

DEFERLITO

You stayed on the phone one-and-a-

half minutes... Mr. Grant, isn't it

the case that you know exactly who

called you and exactly why? Why are

you lying to this court?

JIMMY

I'm not lying.

DEFERLITO

I'm going to introduce into evidence

People's A. This is a toll booth

photograph taken in the northbound ninth

lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant,

directing your attention to the

photograph, would you please read the

date and time stamp indicated on the

lower right hand corner?

JIMMY

This is crazy.

EARL

(whispers in Jimmy's ear)

You're gonna have to answer that.

DEFERLITO

Mr. Grant, please answer the question.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 73.

JIMMY

April 11th, two thirty-three am.

DEFERLITO

Mr. Grant, directing your attention

to the same photograph, would you

please read the license plate

number of the vehicle passing

through the toll?

JIMMY

D D G five five four two.

DEFERLITO

(handing in another sheet)

This is People's B, a printout from

the Department of Motor Vehicles

plate registry... Mr. Grant,

directing your attention to that

printout, are those numbers on the

toll photograph the same ones that

are on your own license plate?

DEFERLITO (CONT'D)

Mr. Grant?

JIMMY

Yes.

DEFERLITO

Yes, the numbers are the same?

JIMMY

Yes.

DEFERLITO

How do you explain that?

JIMMY

I can't.

DEFERLITO

But that is your car in this

photograph, isn't it?

JIMMY

No.

DEFERLITO

No, that is not your car?

(off his silence)

Answer the question, Mr. Grant.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 74.

JIMMY

This is not my car in this picture.

I don't know how you all did that,

but this is not my car.

DEFERLITO

You expect this grand jury to

believe that that is not your car

when there is a printout from the

department of motor vehicles...

EARL

That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito.

DEFERLITO

Mr. Monroe, you are aware that you're

not permitted to go on record.

EARL

Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?

JIMMY

They're lying!

EARL

Okay, now here's what...

BRYER

I can halt the decision.

EARL

We need a minute, Detective.

BRYER

What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?

BRYER (CONT'D)

Cause if you do we could...

JIMMY

You can get the fuck outta my face.

How `bout that?.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 75.

BRYER

So you wanna keep playing games? Or

you ready to tell me something?

EARL

Detective, I need to talk to my client.

Now if you would just please...

JIMMY

How you- How you all just gonna lie

like that? Huh? How you all just

gonna lie?!

BRYER

We didn't lie. You lied.

JIMMY

That wasn't my car.

EARL

...Jimmy, don't say anything else.

BRYER

Sure it wasn't. And it was a

telemarketer called you from the pay

phone? He stopped at the Chevron to

make a late night sale?

JIMMY

That picture was some bullshit...

EARL

...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's

going on?

BRYER

Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.

Tell him. See how the boss'll like

this one.

BRYER (CONT'D)

Last chance.

EARL

(rising, to Jimmy)

Wait here.

CLOSE ON:

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 76.

ASSISTANT

Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce

you to Julie's mom, Sandrine.

ROBERT

I am so, so sorry.

SANDRINE

(nods, then)

I just wanted to thank you for what

you did for my daughter.

ROBERT

(shaking his head softly)

No...

SANDRINE

You believed in her, and you gave

her a chance. She was happy. I know

she was happy.

ROBERT

It's just...

(EMOTIONAL)

not fair, is it?

ROBERT (CONT'D)

(WHISPERS)

This shouldn't have happened.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 77.

ELLEN

...she's rail thin. She's a blond.

I would not have known who she was

if she hadn't come up and

introduced herself to me. She

looked totally different... and...

(notices Brooke increasing

the machine's resistance)

You're going straight to level six

don't you think you better pace

yourself a little bit?

BROOKE

(fakes a smile)

I'm good. I wanna run.

ELLEN

Everything okay with you and Tom?

BROOKE

We're fine.

ELLEN

Are you worried about the deal closing?

BROOKE

(STRIDES FASTER)

No.

ELLEN

You want me to guess?

(NO RESPONSE)

Brookie, come on, don't be silly,

tell me what's...

BROOKE

(heading to pick up her

BELONGINGS)

You know, I can't stay for

breakfast I have to just... I have

to get in to work, I don't know

what I was thinking.

ELLEN

(A BEAT)

Did you uh, finish the deal with

the hospital?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 78.

BROOKE

No.

ELLEN

Did he write the check?

BROOKE

No.

ELLEN

Why not?

BROOKE

Issues related to the closing.

ELLEN

We don't lie to each other, Brooke.

BROOKE

I'm not lying to you. It's

complicated; you wouldn't understand.

ELLEN

(A BEAT)

Uh, I know that a policeman showed

up at the office? Do you know what

that's about?

BROOKE

I honestly have no idea.

ELLEN

What about your father's head-

where he cut his head and the pain

that he's hiding in his stomach

and, now

(starts to tear)

For some reason that's way to

complicated for me to understand,

there's no money for a routine

gift? Does that seem a little

strange to you?

BROOKE

Of course it's strange.

ELLEN

So tell me what's happening.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 79.

BROOKE

(A BEAT)

What do you want me to say? He's my

dad. I have to trust him.

ELLEN

No. You have to do what's right for

you. Not him, not me, not anyone.

This is your life.

BROOKE

(WHISPERS)

I love you.

(HEADING OUT)

I gotta go.

ELLEN

(SOTTO)

Fuck.

ROBERT

You keep sending people to my

office to "do business."

MAYFIELD

They're just getting acquainted.

ROBERT

With the intricacies of my

operation so that you can... not

buy it?

(to a waitress as he sits)

Just coffee, please.

MAYFIELD

You remember what it was like on

our side of the fence. Everything

just moves... a little slower. Plus

this whole audit mess doesn't help.

You know, clearing that all up...

ROBERT

Fuck you.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 80.

MAYFIELD

ROBERT

MAYFIELD

ROBERT

(sotto from the waitress

pouring his coffee)

(returns to volume)

MAYFIELD

ROBERT

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 81.

MAYFIELD

Your price is too high.

ROBERT

You have a nice day, James.

MAYFIELD

(QUICKLY)

Four hundred.

ROBERT

Five-fifty.

MAYFIELD

Four-fifty.

ROBERT

Five twenty-five. That's it. Yes or no?

(SHORT BEAT)

And if it's no, send any further

communication right to my trash can.

MAYFIELD

(extending his hand)

It's a deal.

ROBERT

(GRASPING IT)

One other thing -- six months and I'm

gonna be gone. I'm outta here. My

daughter's gonna take it over. You

know her, you trust her.

MAYFIELD

Alright.

ROBERT

And you're gonna have to make my

son a VP.

MAYFIELD

(LAUGHS)

Robert...

ROBERT

No, no. He doesn't have to do

anything, he just gets the salary,

he gets the office. Both of `em on

five-year employment contracts, and

my lawyers draft them. Yes or no?

MAYFIELD

Yes.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 82.

MAYFIELD (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

ROBERT

I'm writing the deal.

MAYFIELD

Are you serious?

ROBERT

(ripping off the tablecloth)

I'm serious. I'm very serious. Sign it.

MAYFIELD

I'll send over a draft of the press release.

MAYFIELD (CONT'D)

Are you all right?

ROBERT

I'm fine... Before I go -- how much

would you have paid...?

MAYFIELD

Six hundred. And you would've taken...?

ROBERT

Four seventy-five.

MAYFIELD

So we made a good deal.

ROBERT

(as he heads away)

Yeah.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

Actually, I lied. I would've taken four.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 83.

ROBERT

...Anyway I will be seeing most of

you at the gala tomorrow night. But

as the sale's official as of this

afternoon, you are now free to talk

about it. Any questions?

PETER

(JOVIAL)

Will we get new business cards?

ROBERT

(NODS)

Yes, everyone but you.

(HEADING OUT)

Alright, it's a great day. Your

hard work made it happen

GAVIN

(SOTTO)

So how'd you make Mayfield come around?

ROBERT

I met his price. I just took it out of

your share.

GAVIN

Robert?

ROBERT

Yeah.

GAVIN

Good work.

ROBERT

Well, thank you. Now go get me that

fucking hospital check.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

(INTO PHONE)

Yeah.

SYD (O.S.)

It's not good...

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 84.

ROBERT (PRE-LAP)

Hello.

JIMMY

You want something to drink?

ROBERT

What you got?

JIMMY

Not much.

ROBERT

You got any milk?

JIMMY

No.

ROBERT

I'll take a water.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

Where are you going?

JIMMY

What?

ROBERT

The boxes.

JIMMY

I was planning on Virginia, but it

looks like I'm not going anymore.

JIMMY (CONT'D)

You waiting for me to say something?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 85.

ROBERT

JIMMY

ROBERT

JIMMY

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 86.

JIMMY (CONT'D)

ROBERT

JIMMY

ROBERT

(SITS)

JIMMY

ROBERT

JIMMY

(off his silence)

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 87.

ROBERT

(SOTTO)

It was an accident.

JIMMY

And yeah, I know, all the people

counting on you, whatever, but --

you told me Earl was gonna make

this right. Now you know I care

about you, all the things you did

for us, and for my father, but Earl

said they're offering me a deal, no

charges at all. I walk away. They

just want to know who I went to

pick up.

(BEAT)

Why are you putting me in this

position, man? Why are you putting

me in this situation?

ROBERT

(LEANS FORWARD)

Can you just hang tight? Just a

little longer?

JIMMY

Alright, man, but Earl said the deal's

on the table for twenty-four hours.

After that, they're filing the case,

and Earl says we're gonna lose.

ROBERT

(nods, stands)

Alright I hear you. I'll be back

with you as soon as I can. Just

hang with me a little bit.

REINA

You gotta give him up.

JIMMY

You said take the money.

REINA

That was to keep quiet, not to go away.

(BEAT)

What's he offering you now?

JIMMY

What can he offer me?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 88.

SYD (O.S.)

We went to the toll authority. They

said they gave the tape to the cops.

I've requested our investigator go

examine it at the evidence room, but

honestly what's the point?

ROBERT

He says he didn't take the toll.

SYD (O.S.)

And you believe him?

ROBERT

(after a beat)

Does Standard have clawback?

SYD (O.S.)

What? What do you mean?

ROBERT

Let's just say I decide to go in...

SYD (O.S.)

Have you lost your mind?

ROBERT

No, just listen, listen to me. If I

were to surrender, now, could they roll

back the deal?

SYD (O.S.)

(after a beat)

No, what's done is done. There's no

intent to defraud. You haven't warranted

any behavior. So it's just money.

ROBERT

Four years, you think?

SYD (O.S.)

At this point- I dunno, they're not

gonna make it easy.... I really suggest

you think about this.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 89.

ROBERT

(BEAT)

Call the DA, get it started.

ROBERT

(INTO PHONE)

Yeah, Glen. Did Mrs. Miller say where

she was going tonight...? Aha... No,

I'm sure... I'll try her cell.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

(INTO PHONE)

Syd...? Yeah- Did you make that call

to the DA yet...? Thank God. No, no,

no. No. Listen to me, call Earl, tell

him to get his car, tell him to meet

us at my house in twenty minutes...

And, Syd...? Bring a notary.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 90.

He opens a LAPTOP on the passenger seat, typing numbers from

the toll receipt into a little box on the screen. A portable

PRINTER spits out pages. Earl stamps them with a NOTARY.

INT. TOLL AUTHORITY - NIGHT

Earl waits at the front desk of the drab government office.

BRENT, a balding man in his 30's, approaches.

BRENT

Hi I'm Brent Owens, the night

supervisor. How can I help you?

EARL

(handing him some papers)

Hello, Brent. I'm Earl Monroe. I'm

executing a criminal evidence request.

I need to get a look at one of your

lane tapes.

Brent looks over the papers, confused.

BRENT

I don't understand. This says you

want to look at a tape made ten

minutes ago...?

INT. ROBERT'S LIMO - CONTINUOUS

Robert and Syd stare ahead, silently. Syd tries to say something.

ROBERT

(holding up his hand)

Wait. Wait. Just wait.

A RAPPING noise on the window startles Syd, who rolls it

down, sees Earl, and opens the door.

Earl climbs inside, removing a FOLIO from his breast pocket

as he talks.

EARL

Okay, they won't release tapes

without a court order, but they did

give me a print out, the same kind

they used at Jimmy's indictment.

Earl reaches inside the folio and removes the PHOTOGRAPH he

got from the toll authority. He lays it on the counter.

It's from a toll camera, showing his car and license plate.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 91.

ROBERT

(TO EARL)

The Lexus- that's your car, your plate?

ROBERT (CONT'D)

(TO SYD)

You got Jimmy's?

CLOSE-UP:

ROBERT (CONT'D)

Son of a bitch.

CUT TO:

RITTENBAND

Well they look a little different to me,

too... Is there a reason you haven't

allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to

conduct his own analysis?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 92.

DEFERLITO

We've had some issues regarding

chain-of-custody...

RITTENBAND

...You don't have them anymore.

You're to meet him with the evidence

in the next hour.

DEFERLITO

I'm afraid that's not possible.

RITTENBAND

Where's the tape?

(ANOTHER BEAT)

Am I not speaking loud enough?

BRYER

Your honor...

RITTENBAND

Yes?

DEFERLITO

It seems there's been...

RITTENBAND

...Let him tell me.

BRYER

We don't know where it is.

RITTENBAND

Come again?

BRYER

It's not in the evidence locker.

RITTENBAND

Where is it?

BRYER

We don't know.

RITTENBAND

I'll ask you one last time,

detective. Where is the tape?

BRYER

(after a beat)

We lost it.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 93.

RITTENBAND

Hmmm... In light of these

developments, and I would think you

should be very happy to hear this,

with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going

to offer Mr. Deferlito the

opportunity to voluntarily dismiss

the indictment to save us all a

bunch of embarrassment.

DEFERLITO

I don't feel comfortable with that,

your honor.

RITTENBAND

Further I'm going to put all charges

against Mr. Grant under seal.

(Bryer starts heading to

THE DOOR)

This case is dismissed with prejudice

and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,

Detective.

(Bryer stops.)

If you have another suspect in the

automobile death then you are to present

him, but Mr. Grant is free from any

further inquiry in this matter. This is

over. Do I have your understanding?

EARL

Thank you.

RITTENBAND

Close the door, detective,

please...

RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

(BEAT)

You finessed these, didn't you...?

BRYER

I'm sorry?

RITTENBAND

...You finessed it. I know it, and

you know it.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 94.

RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

I know who you're after. I saw all the

evidence, not just the toll photo. You

gotta get him the right way.

BRYER

Oh, okay.

(approaches the judge)

So let me get this straight: What

you're telling me is I'm supposed to

sit around with my thumb up my ass

and my fingers crossed hoping that

one of these fucking days, somewhere

down the line, one of these rich

assholes is gonna say the wrong thing

LOUD enough so that we can't choose

to ignore it anymore?

RITTENBAND

(BEAT)

Get the fuck outta of my office.

BRYER

Yes, your honor.

BRYER

(on the phone)

Well when do you expect her...? When

do you expect her? Okay, well so I

don't have to call a ninth time, will

you take down what I'm sayin', word

for word...? Okay, you got a pencil?

You ready? Okay, here goes: "Mrs.

Miller- Exactly how fuckin' stupid do

you really think I am?"

ROBERT

You didn't hurt anybody. You helped

a lot of people.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 95.

JIMMY

And this piece of paper makes

everything okay?

ROBERT

No, it makes it easier.

JIMMY

(BEAT)

You worried I'm gonna say something?

ROBERT

No.

JIMMY

Robert, look: you asked me to come

meet you and I'm here, but I came

because I wanted to get something

straight between us: we're even.

ROBERT

Okay, we're even. But just for the

record though, what you did...

(picks up the trust document)

Was way beyond the money.

JIMMY

(LAUGHS)

Nothing's beyond money for you.

ROBERT

(LAUGHS BACK)

Thanks a lot.

JIMMY

(pointing to the document)

And if I take this, then what does

that say about me?

JIMMY (CONT'D)

Fuck it. I'm gonna take your money

and do something good with it.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 96.

ROBERT

Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna

get there...? I don't wanna get

there too soon...

ROBERT (CONT'D)

(tying his tie)

You okay? What is it?

ELLEN

You spoke to Brooke?

ROBERT

Did she tell you that?

ELLEN

No. She didn't have to.

ROBERT

Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...

ELLEN

...you explained, did you?

(A BEAT)

Did you tell her everything?

ROBERT

Yes.

ELLEN

Everything?

(off his silence)

Lift up your shirt.

ROBERT

What?

ELLEN

Lift up -- your shirt.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 97.

ELLEN (CONT'D)

ROBERT

(LONG BEAT)

ELLEN

ROBERT

ELLEN

ROBERT

ELLEN

ROBERT

ELLEN

ROBERT

ELLEN

ROBERT

(he's had enough)

ELLEN

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 98.

ROBERT

What about me? What about the

complaints? The unhappiness? The

drinking? The shopping? The

trainers? Everything! But yes, the

charities, the wonderful sainted

charities, you know, all the

wonderful works that you do. How do

you think I've paid for them?

ELLEN

I didn't ask you because I didn't

want you to lie.

ROBERT

(WALKS OFF)

It's cause you didn't want to give

`em up!

ELLEN

But I thought that we had an

understanding. And you broke that

understanding when you brought

Brooke into it.

ROBERT

No, I kept her out.

ELLEN

When you made Brooke complicit-- when

you risked her future-- and I'm done.

ROBERT

What is this?

ELLEN

Read it.

ROBERT

"All ownership and voting rights

transfer to the Miller Charitable

Foundation, to be administered by

Brooke Miller?" Did you really

expect me to sign this thing?

ELLEN

You're not following.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 99.

ROBERT

Apparently not, no. No.

ELLEN

(like talking to a child)

Okay, uhm, the police have been

trying to talk me. I assume they

want to know where you were that

night. And you know what? I'm not

gonna lie for you anymore. Not

unless you sign that.

ROBERT

Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.

ELLEN

I think you'll find a way to

manage. I'm sure you have all kinds

of things offshore for a rainy day.

ROBERT

(SHAKES HEAD)

This is fuckin' crazy.

ELLEN

(FAST)

No, if you sign, then I'll tell your

lie. I'll say you were at home with

me that night, all night, together,

here, and you'll be free and clear.

And the people who need our money

will get it. That's my price.

ROBERT

You're out of your mind. I am not

signing that. I will not sign that!

ELLEN

Well then... I'll have to tell them

that you came home at four-thirty

bruised and bleeding...

ROBERT

(LAUGHS)

That's fucking ridiculous! What...

(crosses close to her)

Are you trying to blackmail me?

ELLEN

I think we call it negotiating.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 100.

ROBERT

You're not gonna win that one.

There's no fucking way.

ELLEN

You know what, it'll cause just

enough trouble- the kind of trouble

that you don't want-- In fact,

according to my lawyer

ROBERT

(PACES)

Fucking lawyer...

ELLEN

It's enough to give them probable

cause and then they can subpoena

your cell phone, GPS, DNA,

ROBERT

Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!

ELLEN

And whatever else they can think of.

So really Robert what you have is a

choice: you can spend the next three

years in court and in the tabloids

or-- you can be at your business.

ROBERT

(SHAKES HEAD)

You won't do it. You won't do this.

You won't do it to the kids.

ELLEN

Just try me.

ELLEN (CONT'D)

(FINALLY CRIES)

You broke -- our little girl's heart.

ROBERT

It's how it all works, Ellen. You

know that.

ELLEN

I do, but she didn't.

ROBERT

She'll be better for it. The world is cold.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 101.

ELLEN

(turns and heads out)

Then you're gonna need a warm coat.

AIMES

There's just one more thing... And

I hate to mention it now, but I

just received it...

MAYFIELD

Speak, John.

AIMES

I had Stern Marling run a secondary

audit on the Miller financials.

MAYFIELD

Who authorized this?

AIMES

I did.

MAYFIELD

(after a beat)

And what did you conclude?

AIMES

It's in front of you.

MAYFIELD

(LAUGHS)

I didn't ask you what the paper said,

John. I asked you what you thought.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 102.

AIMES

(after a beat, carefully)

Well... what do you think?

MAYFIELD

I think... I think... that I don't

see anything wrong here.

BROOKE

...and to receive this prestigious

award, I invite now to the stage

the man who led this generous

effort, and whose financial trading

firm, Miller Capital, has just this

morning been acquired by Standard

Bank and Trust, a dedicated

businessman, family man, scholar,

philanthropist and all-around

humanitarian, a man I am lucky to

call -- my mentor, my friend -- and

my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...

FADE TO BLACK.
