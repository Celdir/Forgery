TITLES BEGIN over the SOUNDS of city traffic.

FADE UP:

The sidewalks are filled with theater-goers heading for

their shows. Cabs line the streets.

SIDE ALLEY

A cab quickly turns into the alley, coming to a

screeching halt. A Man in a Grey Suit jumps out and

rushes to the side entrance of a theater.

In the background we see that the title of the play,

"Anonymous", is written on the theatre's marquee...

We follow the Man in the Grey Suit as he rushes through

narrow backstage hallways, passing several ACTORS

dressing in Elizabethan costumes, applying their make-

up, etc...

TITLES CONTINUE.

The curtains are still closed, and the sound of the

audience excitedly MURMURING behind them is heard. .

Stagehands are moving stage lights as--

A STAGE MANAGER

takes a nervous peek through the curtains to check the

audience-- it's a full house. He holds a prop umbrella

in one hand, anxiously checks his watch in the other.

He looks on both wings of the stage-- and then relief

floods his face as he sees The Man in the Grey Suit

hurrying over to him. The Stage Manager wordlessly

hands him the umbrella and signals to a stagehand in

the background.

The curtains start to OPEN and the MURMUR of the

audience dies down.

1

pg. 2

The man with the umbrella stands on the empty stage, a

single light on him. He is "PROLOGUE". (We will see

the same actor later as the "Prologue" of Henry V).

"Prologue" regards his audience for a   beat before:

PROLOGUE

Soul of the Age!

The applause, delight, the wonder of

our stage!

Our Shakespeare, rise...

(beat, repeating)

Our Shakespeare... For he is all of

ours, is he not? The most performed

playwright of all time! The author of

37 plays, 154 sonnets, and several

epic poems that are collectively known

as the ultimate expressions of

humanity in the English language. And

yet... And yet...

(beat)

Not a single manuscript of any kind

has ever been found written in

Shakespeare's own hand. In four

hundred years, not one document-- be

it poem, play, diary or even a simple

letter.

(beat)

He was born the son of a glove-maker,

and at some unknown time, armed with

but an elementary school education, he

went to London where, the story goes,

he became an actor and eventually a

playwright.

OFF STAGE

A stagehand takes a wooden hammer and beats against a

flat metal pate, creating the SOUNDS of THUNDER.

Another stagehand starts to lift shutters in front of a

stage light back and forth to create LIGHTNING STRIKES.

ON STAGE

"Prologue" opens his umbrella.

PROLOGUE (CONT'D)

He died at the age of 56, and was

survived by his wife and two daughters

who were, like Shakespeare's own

father, irrefutably illiterate.

2

pg. 3

PROLOGUE (O.C.) (CONT'D)

His will famously left his second best

bed to his widow. But it made no

mention of a single book or

manuscript.

PROLOGUE (CONT'D)

Is it possible Shakespeare owned no

books at his death because... he could

not read? That he wrote no letters

because he, like his father before him

and his children after him, could not

write?

(lets that sink in, then)

Our Shakespeare is a cypher, a ghost;

his biography made not by history...

but by conjecture. His story not

written with facts, but with...

imagination.

PROLOGUE (CONT'D)

(more energetic)

So! Let me offer you a different

story. A darker story... Of quills

and swords. Of power and betrayal.

Of a stage conquered, and a throne

lost!

pg. 4

Jonson-- carrying the manuscript-- runs up the street

toward a large circular theater.

He frantically opens the wooden door to the theater--

--and he quickly bolts it behind him, turns, and

desperately looks for a place to hide. He runs towards

the stage as--

About a dozen uniformed guards reach the door. They

are led by Sir Richard POLE (40), Captain of the Guard.

POLE

Break it down!

And several of the guards charge the door with their

pikes, HITTING it hard.

POLE (CONT'D)

Again!

Jonson hurries backstage, and disappears from our view

just as--

--the guards SMASH the door open.    Pole is the first

in.

POLE

Jonson!   Jonson!!    Show yourself!

The soldiers immediately spread out into different

parts of the theater. Jonson's gone. Because--

JONSON

has moved under the stage silently scurrying like a rat

trying to find a place to hide among the stacks of

props and costumes (swords, masks, flags and banners,

shields, barrels, canons, etc.) But Jonson freezes

when he sees--

4

pg. 5

POLE (CONT'D)

Out with you! Jonson! We'll smoke

you out like a rat if we have to!

(beat)

Jonson?! Jonson!!

POLE (CONT'D)

(to a soldier)

Torch it.

POLE (CONT'D)

Torch it!   All of you!

5

pg. 6

Jonson, his hands tied behind him, is pushed through

the door, Pole following.

A small crowd of actors, whores, etc., watch the

theater burn. The guards have to push their way

through them.

INSERT

The fire reaches the fireworks below the theater's

stage, and--

BACK TO SCENE

-- the SOUND of fireworks EXPLODING makes Jonson turn

and see:

THE THEATER

Timbers CRASH and fireworks EXPLODE over the theater.

A longboat carrying Jonson, Pole and the guards makes

its way towards the Tower Of London.

Jonson is thrown into a chair, a guard on either side

of him. It's dark-- the only light coming from a few

torches in the walls, and a large fire pit at the far

side of the room.

An INTERROGATOR (30's) faces him.   Dressed all in

black, he is wispy thin.

INTERROGATOR

You are Benjamin Jonson, playwright?

Son of William Jonson, glass-blower,

son of James Jonson brick-layer?

Jonson nods.

INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)

And have you ever been arrested

before, Mr. Jonson?

JONSON

I'm a writer, aren't I?   Of course

I've bloody well been--

6

pg. 7

FIGURE

Ask him about the plays.

JONSON

(to the Interrogator)

Plays?

(to the Figure)

Which would you prefer, my lord? A

pastoral? An historical? An

historical-pastoral, or an hysterical

historical pastoral--

INTERROGATOR

We are not interested in your plays,

Jonson. We are interested in the

plays given to you by Edward de Vere,

Earl of Oxford.

JONSON

I'm sorry my lord, but I am not sure I

know whereof you speak. I have had

the honor of meeting his lordship--

FLASH CUT TO:

7

pg. 8

The skin has broken on his forehead.     The Interrogator

leans into the bloody Jonson.

INTERROGATOR

Where are the plays?

Before Jonson even has a chance to answer-- SMACK!

CUT TO:

MORE FACES

Laughing.    We are:

And it is nine years earlier. The faces come from an

audience watching a play. They find the performance

hysterical.

The Rose towers above the nearby buildings "Bankside"

(the part of London that houses the theaters,

whorehouses, etc.).

The Rose towers above the nearby buildings "Bankside"

(the part of London that houses the theaters,

whorehouses, etc.).

SOUTHAMPTON (O.S.)

Well?

TWO MEN

walk towards the theater. Edward de Vere (47), the

Earl of OXFORD, an intensely handsome man. His clothes

have seen better days.

His companion is Henry Wriothesley, Earl of SOUTHAMPTON

(22). Blonde, attractive, a bit of a pretty boy-- and

extremely enthusiastic.

SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)

Wonderful, isn't it?

OXFORD

(frowning slightly)

Well, it's certainly... big.

8

pg. 9

SOUTHAMPTON

I promise you, Edward, you've seen

nothing like it before! Nothing!

OXFORD

Bricklayers and whores watching

Aristophones?   You're quite right,

Henry, not only have I never witnessed

it, I'm not sure I care to.

SOUTHAMPTON

(teasing)

You're an elitist, you know that,

Edward?

OXFORD

There won't be puppets, will there?

USHER

My lords...

SOUTHAMPTON

The stage-craft is quite spectacular.

Far more elaborate than anything I've

seen at court. I've witnessed be-

headings that god as my witness look

as real as at the Tower, cannons fired

in battle...

SELLING-MAID

Ale?   Mutton, mi' lord?

9

pg. 10

SOUTHAMPTON

...and last week, they had some sort

of a device to hoist cherubs into the

air and fly over the entire audience!

OXFORD

An apo mekhanes theos. Deus ex

machina. Machine of the Gods.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

Whenever the Greeks wrote their heroes

into a situation from which they

couldn't write their way out--

OXFORD (CONT'D)

--Out came the apo mekhanes theos...

As when Hippolytus is saved by

Artemis, or Medea flown to Athens...

Always good for an apo mekhanes theos

was Euripides

10

pg. 11

SHAKESPEARE

And whither were you riding now,

signior?

"FASTIDIOUS"

Who, I? What a silly jest's that!

Whither should I ride but to the

court?

SHAKESPEARE

O, pardon me, sir, twenty places more;

your hot-house, your pig-house, or

your whore-house!

NASHE

(takes a swig of ale)

His second play, and almost a full

house.

(burps)

He's got a wit, does Jonson.

MARLOWE

That might be so, but like a grain of

wheat hid in a bushel of chaff: you

shall seek all day ere you find it,

and when you have it, it's not worth

the search!

11

pg. 12

WOMAN

Ale!   Ale!!

DEKKER

Marlowe-- spot me a few pence, will

you? Henslowe still owes me for

"Shoemaker's Holiday".

MARLOWE

(retrieving coins)

That would be because no one saw

"Shoemaker's Holiday".

DEKKER

Ale here!

NASHE

Kit... Isn't that one of your

unrequited loves in the box over

there?

MARLOWE

(frowns)

But with whom? Tell me not he prefers

the company of such old grey men as

that!

NASHE

I think-- yes, by the beard, that's

the Earl of Oxford. Old Tom Hooker

used to play for him. Had his own

acting troupe for private Court

performances and the like.

DEKKER

I wonder if he needs any material?

MARLOWE

Certainly not any of yours.

NASHE

No, no-- that was years ago. Had a

falling out with the Queen, I heard.

He's more of a recluse than a patron

these days.

12

pg. 13

SHAKESPEARE

Who, he, the noble there? Why, he's a

gull, a fool, no salt in him i' the

earth; man, he looks like a fresh

salmon kept in a tub!

SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)

He sleeps with a musk-cat every night,

and walks all day hang'd in perfumed

chains for penance.

A GROUNDLING

Oi!   So that's what I been smelling!

SHAKESPEARE

He has his skin tann'd in civet, to

make his complexion strong, and the

sweetness of his youth lasting in the

sense of his sweet lady. And, sadly,

the poor man's brain is lighter than

his feather...

13

pg. 14

SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)

He is a good and empty puff, but he

loves you well, signior. I wish you

well with him.

SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)

Jonson! Wonderful dialogue!

Wonderful. I hope your next--

HENSLOWE (O.C.)

Will!   Will Shakespeare!

HENSLOWE (CONT'D)

That's not ale in that goblet is it?

SHAKESPEARE

Ale? Me? Drink during a performance?

I am a professional sir!

(burps)

A complete and--

14

pg. 15

POLE

This play has been declared seditious

and illegal by Lord William Cecil!

POLE (CONT'D)

All are herewith ordered to disperse

immediately!

A GROUNDLING

Why don't you disperse William Cecil's

arse!

POLE

Arrest that man!

SOUTHAMPTON

Damn it all.    Well! Off to Essex's

then?

SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)

Edward?

JONSON

(to Pole)

Seditious? Seditious?! It's a comedy

for god's sake! There's nothing

seditious about--

POLE

Oi, is that right, is it?    And you

know this because?

JONSON

Because I wrote the bloody thing!      And-

-

POLE

Arrest him as well!

15

pg. 16

Jonson is THROWN into the cell, the door SLAMMED behind

him.

JONSON

(to the door)

A pox on you!

(beat)

And your carbuncled father!

Jonson looks around-- the cell is filled with a dozen

or so other prisoners.

ESSEX (O.S.)

People taxed to the point of

starvation, Spain running the New

World, open revolt in Ireland,

Catholic plots everywhere you turn...

CUT TO:

Robert, Earl of ESSEX (28), is playing tennis against

Southampton. He's handsome, red-headed, and, we will

learn, very ambitious.

ESSEX

...and how do the Cecils spend their

time and energy? Shutting a theater!

A theater, for god's sake? It's

madness! No wonder the mob hates them

so!

The court is inside, and slightly different from

today's game: the back walls are playable, somewhat

like racquet-ball.

Oxford sits on a bench, watching.   Essex SLAMS a shot,

but it goes--

OXFORD

Out!

Essex looks furious, but holds his tongue.   Southampton

prepares to serve.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

(to Southampton)

Henry, how many people were at that

play?

16

pg. 17

Southampton pauses before serving.

SOUTHAMPTON

Hmm? I'm not sure, two thousand,

maybe more.

Southampton SERVES.   Essex returns, and another heated

rally begins.

OXFORD

And how many performances are there of

a play like that?

SOUTHAMPTON

Five or six I suppose.

He HITS the ball again, and this time Essex misses it.

ESSEX

By the--!

OXFORD

(to Essex)

So! Ten thousand souls. All

listening to the writings of one man--

the ideas of one man. That's power,

Robert. And if there is one thing the

Cecils understand, it's power.

ESSEX

(snorts)

And when did words ever win a kingdom?

I think I'll keep my sword, thank you

very much.

Southampton SERVES as Oxford smiles at Essex's naivete.

Southampton and Essex are dressing out of their tennis

clothes and into their normal clothes, assisted by two

valets.

ESSEX

(to the valets)

Leave us.

(they exit)

Henry... Some of my men have...

intercepted... some of William Cecil's

recent correspondence with King James

of Scotland...

17

pg. 18

ESSEX (CONT'D)

Cecil's all but promising him the

throne...

SOUTHAMPTON

To James?   Elizabeth would never agree

to-

ESSEX

Elizabeth is old. Ill. Not of her

old mind. Sometimes she doesn't even

recognize me. And yet, still she

refuses to name an heir.

SOUTHAMPTON

But a Scotsman? On the Tudor throne?

ESSEX

You are not in the Privy Council.

Elizabeth does everything the Cecils

wish of her. Everything!

ESSEX (CONT'D)

Think, Henry, if James owes Cecil his

throne, Cecil will have more influence

in the next reign than he does in this

one. And after William Cecil, his

hunch-backed son will take his

place...

(careful)

That is why we must do everything in

our power to ensure that the right man

succeeds her.

(beat)

A man deserving of the Tudor crown.

ESSEX (CONT'D)

I ask you for the support of you and

your men, Henry.... if it comes to a

fight.

18

pg. 19

Southampton looks at Essex hard.

SOUTHAMPTON

You know you need not ask. I stand

with you, as I always have.

Essex smiles at him warmly. They both HEAR something

shuffle behind them. They turn, and see:

WHERE OXFORD WAS STANDING

Nothing.   He is gone.

BACK TO SOUTHAMPTON AND ESSEX

They exchange a slightly worried look.

CUT TO:

Moments later, Oxford and Southampton are exiting the

elaborate building that serves as Essex's London

residence.

OXFORD

Essex played rather poorly, didn't he?

Southampton just nods, distracted.   Oxford reaches out

to him, and touches his shoulder.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

(warning)

Henry... The Cecils brook no rivals.

Southampton pauses, confused for an instant, then--

SOUTHAMPTON

(re: his discussion with

Essex)

You heard?

Oxford nods.

SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)

Always concerned for me, aren't you

Edward?

They keep walking towards Southampton's men.

SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)

And what would you have me do?

19

pg. 20

OXFORD

I would have you deny him.

SOUTHAMPTON

The son of the Queen?

OXFORD

That is rumor only, Henry--

SOUTHAMPTON

Rumor? My god, all you have to do is

look at Essex to see the Queen's

reflection. Everyone thinks he's her

son, everyone! And I for one would

rather bow to a Tudor, bastard though

he may be, than a Scotsman!

OXFORD

I desire nothing more than to see the

next king be the rightful king. But

what Essex contemplates will surely

lead to Civil War.

(beat)

No. If this is to be done, it must be

done carefully, skillfully.

SOUTHAMPTON

As I heard it, Elizabeth exiled you

from her presence for the last twenty

years because of your "skill" at Court

politics.

OXFORD

I only have your interests in mind,

Henry. For as you so rightly point

out, my interests are already lost.

SOUTHAMPTON

I know. Forgive me. You know how I

feel about you. You have been a great

friend to me ever since my father

died. I promise you that I will do

nothing rash without consulting you

first.

20

pg. 21

OXFORD

Henry! Will you do me one thing more?

Deliver a gift for me? A rather...

elaborate gift?

The stone house is nothing like a stereotypical Tudor

house; it's enormous, and very ornate and intricate in

design.

It faces the river, and has an elaborate docking area

which is now filled with all sorts of longboats letting

the noblemen off for a week-end get away.

Most of England's nobility is assembled in small

groups, talking. It's a dour, quiet affair. Some

music, no life. Quite Puritan.

Southampton is there, but Essex and Oxford are nowhere

to be seen.

A HUNCH-BACKED MAN

--makes his way through the room, causing conversations

to cease as he walks by. Even the most senior of the

nobles bow their heads slightly in greeting him. This

is Sir ROBERT CECIL (mid 30's).

He pauses near Southampton.

SOUTHAMPTON

Sir Robert.

ROBERT CECIL

My lord of Southampton.

(looking around)

Have you seen Essex?

SOUTHAMPTON

I believe he is still in the viewing

chamber with her majesty...

ROBERT CECIL

(sharp, annoyed)

Alone?

21

pg. 22

SOUTHAMPTON

(smiles)

With your father in London dealing

with all the troubles in Ireland, who

else should the Queen turn to but

Essex?

FOOTMAN

By the grace of god, her majesty,

Elizabeth, Queen of England, Wales and

Ireland!

ESSEX

(to Elizabeth)

Ah-- Majesty, I've been told my lord

of Southampton has a gift for you.

ELIZABETH

(eyes sparkle)

A gift?

SOUTHAMPTON

Yes, your grace, though not from me.

22

pg. 23

ELIZABETH

Are you this gift, my precious little

man?

DWARF

No, no, my most majestic majesty. I

am a free man. My gift is a play,

majesty.

ELIZABETH

A play?

ROBERT CECIL

(to the Dwarf)

Plays are the work of the devil, born

from a cesspool of plague, whoredom,

thievery, fornication, and heresy.

You may tell your master that her

majesty--

ESSEX

(interrupting)

--Will gladly accept your gift.

ESSEX (CONT'D)

(to Elizabeth)

Of course that is if you so desire,

majesty.

(to Robert Cecil)

The choice is her majesty's to make,

not yours. Is that not so Sir Robert?

ELIZABETH

(to the dwarf)

Comedy? Or tragedy?

DWARF

Comedy, majesty.

ELIZABETH

(delighted)

A comedy!

(MORE)

23

pg. 24

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

(beat)

By whom?

DWARF

By... Anonymous, your majesty...

ELIZABETH

Anonymous...?

(then)

Oh, but I do so admire his verse...

Elizabeth lets go of Essex, and offers her hand to the

Dwarf, who smiles brightly.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

Lead us to this gift.

And the Dwarf leads Elizabeth towards the door. Essex

follows, and Southampton locks into step next to him.

They exchange a knowing look as--

Robert Cecil steps in line far after the Queen, not

happy with this turn of events as we hear--

"QUINCE" (O.S.)

Bless thee, Bottom! Bless thee!      Thou

art translated!

CUT TO:

Sheer magic. Candles everywhere: in stakes, in the

ground, in the trees. They light a make-shift "stage"

surrounded by huge oak trees on three sides.

"BOTTOM"

I see their knavery: this is to make

an ass of me; to fright me, if they

could. But I will not stir from this

place, do what they can.

Chairs have been brought out and put in rows in the

grass. Elizabeth is watching center front row (of

course). She loves it, SQUEALING in delight like a

young woman. Essex is next to her.

24

pg. 25

"BOTTOM" (CONT'D)

I will walk up and down here, and I

will sing, that they shall hear I am

not afraid.

"BOTTOM" (CONT'D)

(sings)

The ousel cock so black of hue,

With orange-tawny bill,

The throstle with his note so true,

The wren with little quill--

"TITANIA"

What angel wakes me from my flow'ry

bed?

25

pg. 26

Thirty-eight years earlier. And YOUNG ELIZABETH watches

an earlier, slightly less sophisticated staging of "A

Midsummer Night's Dream" (the costumes and sets are a

bit more thrown together).

All the actors are children from 7-12 years old or so.

FROM BACKSTAGE

A boy watches in the exact same position as we just saw

Oxford. This is BOY OXFORD-- now only 10 years old.

But he is made up and wears a winged costume for the

character of "Puck".

"OBERON" (O.S.)

...and the owner of it blest ever

shall in safety rest. Trip away; make

no stay;

meet me all by break of day.

And the characters of "Oberon" and "Titania" exit.     Boy

Oxford hurries--

ON STAGE

"PUCK"

If we shadows have offended, think but

this, and all is mended, that you have

but slumber'd here while these visions

did appear...

Next to Young Elizabeth, JOHN DE VERE, Oxford's father,

also watches, his face beaming with pride.

"PUCK" (CONT'D)

...And this weak and idle theme, No

more yielding but a dream, gentles, do

not reprehend; if you pardon, we will

mend.

A STERN LOOKING MAN

is watching a few seats   away from Young Elizabeth.   He

is WILLIAM CECIL (40's,   Robert's father). He is a

Puritan, dressed all in   black (with a white lace

collar), and has a long   beard. He is frowning,

loathing the play.

26

pg. 27

ON STAGE

"PUCK" (CONT'D)

So, good night unto you all. Give me

your hands, if we be friends, and

Robin shall restore amends.

The play now over, Young Elizabeth applauds with

delight, as do the small group of courtiers all around

her.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

Lovely.    Lovely!

CUT TO:

A make-shift "back-stage" where all the young "actors"

are removing their costumes and make-up, including Boy

Oxford, who sits in front of a make-shift, leaning

mirror.

Much excited talking and commotion, until Boy Oxford

notices everyone has gone silent. He turns-- his winged

costume still on-- just as--

YOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.)

Ah!    There he is.

Young Elizabeth and her senior Court, including William

Cecil and John De Vere, have entered.

Boy Oxford bows deeply.

YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

(to Boy Oxford)

Your father tells me you wrote this

evening's play yourself.

Boy Oxford glances at his father-- should he answer

directly? His father NODS.

BOY OXFORD

I did indeed, your majesty.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

You sport with me.

(smiling)

Compose something.

BOY OXFORD

Now?

27

pg. 28

YOUNG ELIZABETH

Yes.   Now.

BOY OXFORD

On what subject, your grace?

YOUNG ELIZABETH

(smiles)

Truth...

BOY OXFORD

(thinks, then--)

For... Truth... is Truth...

Though... never so old...

and time cannot make that false,

which once was true.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

(to John de Vere)

My lord of Oxford. It seems you have

added a poet to your family's long

line of warriors.

BOY OXFORD

Madam, I am as accomplished with the

sword and the musket as I am with

verse.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

(amused)

Are you indeed?

BOY OXFORD

(nods seriously)

It is my only desire to one day be

your majesty's most trusted servant in

matters both of war and state, if you

will but have me.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

(charmed)

Why, Lord Cecil, it seems we may very

well have found your replacement.

WILLIAM CECIL

We hope not too soon, majesty, we hope

not too soon.

28

pg. 29

YOUNG ELIZABETH

(teasing)

And how liked you our young lord's

play, William?

William Cecil stiffens in discomfort.

YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

(to Boy Oxford,

conspiratorially)

Our Lord Cecil is our most religious

of subjects, and no doubt thinks your

little masque will deliver your soul

straight into the arms of Lucifer

himself. Don't you, William?

The Boy Oxford looks at William Cecil, perplexed by

such a thing.

WILLIAM CECIL

That is God's decision, your majesty.

Not mine.

William Cecil looks directly at John de Vere resulting

in an uncomfortable silence.

Elizabeth notices.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

Well, if plays are indeed such a sin,

I pray I do not find my salvation

until very late in life.

Boy Oxford smiles.   He might very well be in love.

CUT TO:

Thirty-eight years later. The door SWEEPS open and a

snoring, sleeping Jonson is awakened by--

GUARD (O.S.)

Jonson!    Ben Jonson!

The other prisoners make way as the guard approaches

Jonson. The guard tosses a wax-sealed piece of

parchment onto Jonson's lap.

GUARD (CONT'D)

You've been released.

Jonson looks at it, confused.

29

pg. 30

GUARD (CONT'D)

Got powerful friends, now, don't you?

Jonson is in a nobleman's longboat (for the first time

in his life). Across from him sits FRANCESCO--

Italian, 60's-- wearing a doublet with the Oxford coat

of arms on its chest.

The City of London is far in the distance.

Jonson looks around uncomfortably at the luxurious boat

for a moment before--

JONSON

And who are you?

Francesco just stares back.

JONSON (CONT'D)

And where are we going?

Francesco is silent.

WIDER

The boat approaches a large stone house, Oxford Stone.

CUT TO:

A RED ROSE

as it is cut from its bush by ink-stained hands.       We

are:

Oxford smells the rose, inhaling its essence. Then he

turns and sees Francesco escorting Ben Jonson towards

him.

Before they reach him he glances at his wife ANNE De

Vere (40's) who sits in the distance knitting with one

of their daughter's, BRIDGET (17).

Jonson is quite uncomfortable to be at such a grand

place. Jonson CLEARS his throat.

JONSON

My lord...

30

pg. 31

OXFORD

The Tudor rose. The most beautiful of

flowers, don't you think?

JONSON

It looks to me to have quite a number

of thorns, my lord.

OXFORD

So it does.   So it does.

JONSON

I am told, my lord, that I owe my

freedom to you.

OXFORD

That is true. And it was quite hard

to come by. One does not cross my

father-in-law lightly.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

Lord William Cecil. I have the

questionable distinction of being

married to his only daughter.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

It did, however, serve as helpful when

I wrote to your jailers to release you

in my father-in-law's name.

JONSON

(in a panicked whisper)

My lord-- I'm sorry, does that mean my

release is not officially sanctioned?

OXFORD

Don't be an idiot Jonson, of course it

wasn't.

(beat)

But you are free, are you not?

31

pg. 32

Oxford turns to Jonson.

OXFORD

I enjoyed your little comedy last

week, Jonson. You have potential,

great potential.

JONSON

Thank you, my lord.

OXFORD

But it's politics did seem to have

quite an effect on the Tower. My

father-in-law's men felt it quite

seditious.

JONSON

Politics? My play had nothing to do

with politics! It was just a simple

comedy--

OXFORD

That showed your betters as fools who

go through life barely managing to get

food from plate to mouth, were it not

for the cleverness of their servants.

(beat)

All art is political, Jonson.

Otherwise it would just be decoration.

And all artists have something to say,

otherwise... they'd make shoes. And

you're not a cobbler, are you, Jonson?

As they enter the center of the maze, Oxford turns to

his servant.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

(nods)

Francesco.

Francesco steps forward and hands Jonson a leather

bound manuscript. Jonson looks at it confused and

opens it.

JONSON

A play, my lord?

OXFORD

One you shall stage Bankside.

JONSON

Stage?

32

pg. 33

OXFORD

Under your name.

JONSON

My name, my lord?

OXFORD

I can't very well use my name, can I?

I'm the seventeenth Earl of Oxford.

The Lord Great Chamberlain of England,

Viscount Bolebec, Lord Escales,

Sandford and Badlesmere, etc, etc.

No. I have a... reputation to

protect. In my world, one does not

write plays, Jonson. People like you

do.

JONSON

Yes. My lord. You wrote an entire

play, my lord. I know how difficult--

OXFORD

Not a play, Jonson, I've written many.

No doubt, many more than you yourself.

A good number performed at Court years

ago, others never seen by a living

soul.

JONSON

And you want... me to apply my name to

this play?

OXFORD

No. I mean you to put your name to

all of them.

JONSON

All of them?

OXFORD

Well don't look like I just gutted

your pet dog, Jonson. I mean to make

you the most popular-- and therefore

the most monetarily successful--

playwright in all of London.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

I wish you god speed and good morrow.

33

pg. 34

JONSON

My lord-- I really--

He looks up, but Oxford is gone, having left the maze

without so much as a good-bye.

JONSON (CONT'D)

My lord?

But before he can follow, Francesco tosses a leather

pouch of coins at his feet.

FRANCESCO

That is for your trouble, Signor

Jonson. And your silence. If I hear

you break that silence, then... not so

good for Signor Jonson.

And Francesco follows after his master as Jonson picks

up the pouch, examining its contents.

And then Jonson realizes he doesn't know how to get out

of the maze. He chases after them.

JONSON

Hello?   My lord?! I--

And he's lost. He looks this way and that, then picks

a path (the wrong one).

Robert Cecil is standing at the opulent river   entrance

to Cecil House, waiting for an enormous barge   docking.

William Cecil (now 75) is at the front of the   barge,

waiting to disembark. He constantly holds an    ornately

carved white cane.

WILLIAM CECIL

So! I am gone for three days, and you

somehow manage to let her spend all of

them solely in the company of the Earl

of Essex...

Robert Cecil looks at him sharply.   How did he know.

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

Don't think because I was in London, I

didn't know exactly what went on here

in my absence.

34

pg. 35

ROBERT CECIL

He is an Earl, father. I cannot deny

him--

WILLIAM CECIL

Of course not! You don't deny him

anything. You find excuses. She is

unwell, she is reading, she is seeing

the Ambassador from Russia. For God's

sake, use your imagination, Robert.

Whatever will you do when I am gone?

(beat)

We will have to deal with Essex soon.

His ambitions are becoming a nuisance.

William Cecil enters an impressive hallway and turns to

his son.

WILLIAM CECIL

Now tell me about the play.

Robert Cecil looks surprised for an instant that he

knows about that as well.

ROBERT CECIL

It-- it was an anonymous gift. Essex

insisted it be performed, just to

spite me in front of Court...

WILLIAM CECIL

Of course he did.

(concerned)

But what was it about?

ROBERT CECIL

About? Some nonsense about fairies

and cherubs.

WILLIAM CECIL

...And dancing asses?

Robert looks surprised at his father who has stopped

suddenly.

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

(realizing, to himself)

Edward...

(to Robert Cecil)

Have you any idea what you have-- No,

how could you...

35

pg. 36

And he starts back up the stairs.

ROBERT CECIL

Father...    It was just a play...

WILLIAM CECIL

And do you know how long it took me to

banish them from her presence? She

adores them! Adores them! And Edward

knows it.

(beat)

Mark my words, Robert, he has done

this for a purpose.

ROBERT CECIL

Purpose?    What purpose?

WILLIAM CECIL

(thinking, to himself)

What purpose indeed?

(to Robert)

But through your carelessness I must

now deal not only with Essex, but

Edward as well. For whether in shadow

or in person, Edward has returned to

Court!

And with that he slams the door shut.

Robert Cecil walks over to a nearby window. Visibly

upset he starts to stare out of the window and

remembers...

CUT TO:

THROUGH A THIRD STORY WINDOW

We see servants carrying big trunks. There are at least

120 men on horses. They all wear the Oxford's crest.

WILLIAM CECIL (O.S)

Robert.

And it is thirty years earlier.

BOY ROBERT CECIL (now 9) is staring out of the window.

His back must have been deformed either in utero or at

birth, because even now he is hunchbacked.

36

pg. 37

WILLIAM CECIL(O.S.)

(more commanding)

Robert! Come here.

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

(to Young Oxford)

I am sorry, my lord. But my son

Robert prefers the company... of

himself...

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

May I present my wife, Lady Cecil, and

my daughter, Anne.

YOUNG ANNE

I am sorry for your loss, my lord.

The realm lost a great lord with your

father's death. We hope you will be

happy in our house--

BOY ROBERT CECIL (O.S.)

Are you going to live here forever?

YOUNG OXFORD

(smiles)

No.    Only until I reach my maturity.

BOY ROBERT CECIL

Why?

WILLIAM CECIL

Because the Queen has bade it so.

(to Young Oxford)

My lord, when we first met, you said

you wished to become a great man of

State. Both the Queen and I hope to

make that so.

(MORE)

37

pg. 38

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

To that end, I have the honor of

introducing you to your tutors.

(indicates one of them)

Seven to eight you shall be tutored in

French by Mister Crane--

YOUNG OXFORD

Monsieur. Ca me fait plaisir de vous

connaitre.

WILLIAM CECIL

Nine to ten is Greek with Mister

Simmons.

YOUNG OXFORD

(in Greek)

Dalon, an d'ego, hoti mathamata ge

esti ha trafo psychas.

BOY ROBERT CECIL

Is that Homer?

YOUNG OXFORD

(sharp)

No.   Plato.

WILLIAM CECIL

(slight frown, then)

And you know your uncle, Mister

Golding, who has petitioned me to

allow you to assist him in his

translations of ancient Latin texts

into English.

YOUNG OXFORD

(in Latin)

Continetne, ut spero, Ovidii

Metamorphose? Mihi honori erit,

patrue

WILLIAM CECIL

Then cosmography with Doctor Richards.

Two to three is geography and history,

and four to five fencing.

38

pg. 39

YOUNG OXFORD

(to William Cecil)

And composition? Poetry?

WILLIAM CECIL

This is a Puritan home, your grace.

We believe such activities to be the

worship of false idols, and therefore

a sin before the eyes of God.

YOUNG OXFORD

A sin? But surely there must be room

for beauty and art in life, my lord.

WILLIAM CECIL

Not in this household.

Young Oxford is fencing with a tutor. He's quite good.

In fact, he's better than the tutor, who is twice his

age.

Boy Robert Cecil casually watches as he plays chess

against himself.

Young Oxford, with a fierce, beautifully executed

attack, disarms his tutor. The tutor's sword FLIES

into the air, and hits--

THE CHESS BOARD

making the pieces scatter.

WIDER

Boy Robert Cecil looks up, his face furious, to see

Young Oxford coming over to him.

YOUNG OXFORD

You were losing anyway.

BOY ROBERT CECIL

I was also winning.

Young Oxford picks up the sword, throws it to his

tutor, who catches it.

BOY ROBERT CECIL

(CONT'D)

You know I am going to one day succeed

my father at the Queen's side. Not

you.

39

pg. 40

Young Oxford motions to go, then picks up the black

king, and tosses it to Boy Robert Cecil, who can't

catch it because of his deformity. It CLANGS on the

floor.

YOUNG OXFORD

Really?

Moments later, the Young Oxford heads down the hall

alone, heading for his rooms, his sword still in his

hand.

CUT TO:

POEMS

neatly written on parchment.   We are:

And a SERVANT is looking at the poems, then quickly

stuffing them into a bag.

But then he HEARS footsteps coming. Panicked, he looks

for someplace to hide-- a tapestry half covers a door--

he runs to it-- the door is locked!

So he hides behind the tapestry just as the door opens,

and Young Oxford enters.

After a few steps, Young Oxford senses something amiss.

Looks at his--

WRITING DESK

where the parchments are scattered.

YOUNG OXFORD

goes to his desk, picks up one of the pieces of

parchment. It has poetry on it. His poetry. He goes

through some other pages. And realizes other pages are

missing. He becomes infuriated. He sees--

UNDER THE TAPESTRY

Two feet.

40

pg. 41

WIDER

Young Oxford CHARGES the tapestry, sword in hand.     He

THRUSTS the sword THROUGH the tapestry.

The man screams in agony as he falls. He doesn't just

die, but screams and screams and screams.

Young Oxford steps back-- half in horror... half in

triumph. The SOUND of APPLAUSE takes us to:

Thirty-three years later.

Shakespeare is on stage, taking a bow. The audience is

APPLAUDING and SCREAMING their approval of a

performance that has just ended. He steps backwards--

BACKSTAGE

--where Jonson stands holding the manuscript Oxford

gave him.

SHAKESPEARE

Is it any good?

JONSON

How in blazes should I know?

SHAKESPEARE

You haven't even read it?

And Shakespeare is drawn back--

ON STAGE

--where he bows again, then steps--

BACKSTAGE

--so Jonson can answer him.

JONSON

I read a line or two-- I promised

Henslowe I'd finish "Eastward Ho" by

Saturday.

SHAKESPEARE

And you say he's a nobleman?

Jonson doesn't answer.

41

pg. 42

SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)

Powerful?   Rich??

Jonson still doesn't answer, which is answer enough.

SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)

Ohhhh, you have to do it then, don't

you?

And Shakespeare goes back on stage.

Jonson and Shakespeare are walking along Bankside,

still mid-conversation. They pass all sorts of vendors

selling fish, fresh water, food, etc...

JONSON

I tell you Will-- I came to London to

become a great poet, to, to, be the

conscience of our times, the soul of

our age! To change the world, not to

become someone else's--

SHAKESPEARE

(amused)

Change the world? With rhyme?

JONSON

Yes, why not? Why can't a man change

the world with words?

Shakespeare laughs at him.

JONSON (CONT'D)

(mimicking Oxford)

"I can make you the most popular and

the richest playwright in all of

London."

(takes a swig)

Ballocks! I can do that myself, thank

you very much.

Shakespeare is perusing the manuscript.   Some of the

actors from the Rose are in the BG.

SHAKESPEARE

You know, it's actually not half

bad...

42

pg. 43

Jonson takes a swig of ale, then--

JONSON

Not half--?! You're an actor, what in

God's name do you know about writing?!

He's an amateur, Will, a complete and

utter amateur. Last week gardening,

this week playwrighting, next week

hawking.

(takes another swig)

No. I won't do it. It would be an

affront against the Muses...

SHAKESPEARE

(smiles)

Well we musn't offend the muses,

whatever we do.

(thinks, then)

How much money did you say he gave

you?

JONSON

What, you think my name can be bought,

if the number's great enough, do you?

Shakespeare smiles enigmatically.

SHAKESPEARE

No, not at all... I think we should

keep your good name quite intact,

thank you very much.

Jonson frowns, confused as we--

CUT TO:

A RED WIG

as it is placed on the head of Elizabeth.   We are:

Elizabeth is behind an elaborately painted screen.

Several ladies-in-waiting attend her, helping her get

ready for the day. It's an intricate process. Make-

up, multiple articles of clothing, jewelry...

WILLIAM CECIL (O.S.)

King Philip of Spain sees the current

Catholic revolt in Ireland as a

weakness of ours. A weakness to be

exploited....

43

pg. 44

ELIZABETH

Ireland?

WILLIAM CECIL

There are rumors of his sending

financial aid, and even troops. We

must act quickly.

(beat)

We must replace the Lord Lieutenant of

Ireland, and send additional troops

immediately, majesty.

ELIZABETH

Replace?   With whom?

WILLIAM CECIL

I would recommend the Earl of Essex,

your majesty.

ELIZABETH

Essex?  To Ireland?

(frowns)

For how long?

WILLIAM CECIL

As long as the present crisis

warrants, majesty.

ELIZABETH

Impossible. He cannot be spared. We

feel his counsel is of greater import

with each passing day.

WILLIAM CECIL

I only recommend we send your most

able subjects where they are most

needed, majesty.

(beat, a last-ditch

effort)

Philip of Spain dreams still of taking

your kingdom from you.

(MORE)

44

pg. 45

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

Of burning you at the stake as a

heretic. Give him a foot-hold in

Ireland, and--

ELIZABETH

But Essex?

WILLIAM CECIL

Essex's martial abilities are, in my

opinion, the only antidote to the

plague of Philip.

(clears his throat)

Though, Essex would not,

unfortunately, be able to remain in

the Privy Council if he is in

Ireland...

ELIZABETH

And who would you advise to replace

him?

WILLIAM CECIL

Sir Robert Cecil.

ELIZABETH

Your son?

WILLIAM CECIL

He is my own advisor first, my son

second, majesty. His counsel has been

invaluable to me, and no doubt will be

to you as well.

ELIZABETH

Yes, yes, yes. We will send Essex to

Ireland and place Robert on my Privy

Council.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

I saw a play this last weekend,

William. It made me think of... days

long past. Of memories... long past.

Long past. I should like to see more

of them...

Has Edward been happy, William? With

your daughter?

45

pg. 46

William Cecil doesn't answer. Instead he thinks,

remembers, as we hear his younger voice...

WILLIAM CECIL (O.S.)

Murdered!

CUT TO:

Thirty years earlier.

William Cecil is standing in front of an enormous

fireplace, pacing in a pique of anger.

WILLIAM CECIL

By your own hand!

YOUNG OXFORD

He was stealing my poems.

WILLIAM CECIL

He was doing my bidding!

YOUNG OXFORD

Yours?

WILLIAM CECIL

Of course. As soon as Robert informed

me that you were disobeying my

express--

YOUNG OXFORD

Robert?   Robert told--

William Cecil SLAMS his fists on a table.

WILLIAM CECIL

Enough! Thou shalt not worship false

idols in my household! Your

everlasting soul hangs in the balance.

Not poems. Your soul!

YOUNG OXFORD

My poems are my soul!

William Cecil turns away in frustration as much as

disgust.

WILLIAM CECIL

You have placed me in a grave

position, Edward.

(MORE)

46

pg. 47

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

I cannot have my reputation soiled by

this regrettable lack of control on

your part... No. I will not have it.

We can claim self-defense, he drew

sword first.

(beat)

But... I wish something in return.

Young Oxford looks worried.

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

My daughter is young, impressionable.

She has feelings for you, Edward. It

is to be expected, living in such

close quarters...

YOUNG OXFORD

Sir. For the last three years you

have managed to seize much of my

inheritance--

WILLIAM CECIL

Hold your tongue, Edward, before you

make a claim you cannot retract! I

have been legally reimbursed for your

education and living expenses.

YOUNG OXFORD

And now you suggest you be

"reimbursed" the rest of my once

considerable estates through your

daughter's bed?

William Cecil studies Young Oxford's face.

WILLIAM CECIL

No. This is how I suggest you keep

your noble head from the executioner's

block.

YOUNG OXFORD

stares at him.   The SOUND of CHURCH BELLS RINGING takes

us to:

And Young Oxford and Anne are being married by a

bishop.

47

pg. 48

BISHOP

...and in the fear of god, duly

considering the causes for which

matrimony was ordained. One was the

procreation of children...

WILLIAM CECIL

appears triumphant.   He looks beaming over to...

BISHOP (CONT'D)

...to be brought up in the fear and

nurture of the Lord and praise of God.

Secondly, it was ordained for a remedy

against sin.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

Who presides over the whole affair. The first time we

see a dress on her which makes her truly regal.

BISHOP (CONT'D)

Thirdly, for the mutual society, help

and comfort, that the one ought to

have of the other, both in prosperity

and adversity, into the which holiest

state these two persons present come

now to be joined.

AT THE ALTAR

Young Anne looks at her young husband, lovingly. Young

Oxford is a bit overwhelmed and unsure of it all. And

then we HEAR a trumpet BLARING, which takes us to:

Thirty-two years later.

Vendors hawk food and drink as they walk through the

audience.

IN OXFORD'S BOX

Oxford sits, Francesco behind him, exhilarated by the

scene below him.

IN THE GALLERIES

Marlowe, Dekker and Nashe are looking at their single-

sheet programs.

48

pg. 49

NASHE

"Henry V" by... No one?

MARLOWE

And why would any of you admit to

trying to better me in a historical

drama? Comedy, yes, tragedy, perhaps.

But never will one of you best me in

historicals.

MARLOWE (CONT'D)

Or will we be seeing a most hysterical

historical?

MARLOWE (CONT'D)

Hmm? Ben? Waiting to see how it's

received before you lay claim??

"PROLOGUE"

Oh, for a muse of fire, that would

ascend the brightest heaven of

invention. A kingdom for a stage,

princes to act, and monarchs to behold

the swelling scene! Then should

warlike Harry, like himself, assume

the port of Mars, and at his heels

should famine, sword, and fire crouch

for his employment. Can this cockpit

hold the vasty fields of France?

CUT TO:

49

pg. 50

And Southampton is riding his horse at full gallop

through the countryside. About two dozen retainers

follow, the first few with Southampton's coat-of-arms

on flags.

It is later in the play.

On stage, about 15 actors are in full battle armor.

They include: "HENRY V", played by the actor called

Spencer, "WESTMORELAND", "EXETER", "SALISBURY". All

the men on stage now wear battle armor.

"HENRY V"

This day is called the feast of

Crispian: he that outlives this day,

and comes safe home, will stand a tip-

toe when this day is named, and rouse

him at the name of Crispian.

IN THE GALLERIES

Marlowe, Dekker, Nashe and Jonson all watch, obviously

impressed. Nashe takes a swig of Ale.

IN OXFORD'S BOX

Oxford watches, loving the stagecraft involved in the

production.

"HENRY V" (CONT'D)

He that shall see this day and live

t'old age, will yearly on the vigil

feast his neighbors, and say 'To-

morrow is Saint Crispian.

ON STAGE

"Henry V" speaks to his men.

"HENRY V" (CONT'D)

Then will he strip his sleeve and show

his scars.

The actor playing "Henry" kneels at the front of the

stage. He speaks to the groundlings as though they are

his troops.

50

pg. 51

"HENRY V" (CONT'D)

And say 'These wounds I had on

Crispin's day.' Old men forget: yet

all shall be forgot, but he'll

remember with advantages what feats he

did that day. This story shall the

good man teach his son.

"HENRY V" (CONT'D)

And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go

by, from this day to the ending of the

world, but we in it shall be

remembered; we few, we happy few, we

band of brothers; for he to-day that

sheds his blood with me shall be my

brother; be he ne'er so vile, this day

shall gentle his condition: and

gentlemen in England now a-bed shall

think themselves accursed they were

not here, and hold their man-hoods

cheap whiles any speaks that fought

with us upon Saint Crispin's day!

"SALISBURY"

My sovereign lord, bestow yourself

with speed. The French are bravely in

their battles set and will with all

expedience charge on us.

"HENRY V"

All things are ready, if our minds be

so.

"WESTMORELAND"

Perish the man whose mind is backward

now!

51

pg. 52

"HENRY V"

You know your places: God be with you

all!

THE "HUT"

which is a round tower on top of the stage, contains

several small cannons manned by stagehands. They shoot

BLANK CANNON SHOTS.

Southampton and his retainers gallop through a City

gate. Above the gate, the severed heads of murderers

sit on pikes.

Actors portraying French soldiers STORM the stage,

swords brandished. "Henry" and his men begin fighting

them, their swordplay elaborate and impressive.

Southampton and his entourage gallop over London

Bridge.

The battle rages on stage.

One hardy audience member starts to actually ATTACK one

of the French "soldiers" himself. He's quickly joined

by a few comrades-- and it quickly becomes a madhouse;

half play, half real fight, as more audience members

join the "battle". The play quickly degenerates into a

bloody brawl between actors and audience.

Southampton arrives at the theater.   He jumps   off his

horse, and hurries--

INTO THE STAIRWELL

jumping two steps at a time. We HEAR the sound of

APPLAUSE. The play is now over. Southampton hurries

into--

52

pg. 53

SOUTHAMPTON

William Cecil's convinced the Queen

that only Essex can save Ireland from

the Revolt.

SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)

I've pledged to go with him, Edward.

We sail in an hour.

OXFORD

Henry--

SOUTHAMPTON

I ask for your blessing, Edward.

OXFORD

I can't give it to you.

NASHE

I for one wish to see this anonymous

colleague of ours.

(stands)

Playwright! Playwright!!

SOUTHAMPTON

If he is to be my king, then it is my

sacred duty to be with him in battle.

53

pg. 54

Oxford tries to understand Southampton, but then

notices Shakespeare on stage. His mouth opens in

shock, and he turns to look across the theater at--

JONSON

who guiltily looks away.   Marlowe's mouth is open, his

hands stop applauding.

IN OXFORD'S BOX

Southampton is angered by Oxford's distraction.

SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)

I am sorry to have disturbed your

entertainment.

And he exits.

OXFORD

Henry-- Henry!!

But the younger man is gone.

ON STAGE

Shakespeare bows, then--

SHAKESPEARE

I, I... It's been... I, I, want

to... thank my actors, whose great

acting brought... my words... to life

due to their most finest acting.

Ah... Thank you.

OXFORD (O.S.)

An actor?!!

CUT TO:

The multi-arched ceiling is painted blue with gold

stars. Globes-- both terrestrial and astral-- abound.

Jonson stands in front of a very angry Oxford.

OXFORD

An actor for god's sake?

JONSON

My lord, I thought that--

54

pg. 55

OXFORD

You presumed to think? On my behalf?

Whatever made you believe you had that

prerogative?

A beat.   Jonson is a bit afraid.

JONSON

My lord, your voice is completely

different than mine. My, my, my

characters are--

OXFORD

Voice? You have no voice! That's why

I chose you!

(beat, softer)

You at least kept my name from him?

Jonson NODS.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

And will continue to do so?

Oxford studies him, believes him.   Then he opens a

cabinet.

In it, manuscript after manuscript are stacked.     Jonson

looks behind him, stunned by the number.

Oxford looks up and down the cabinet. He pulls one

out, decides no, and puts it back, looking for just the

right one... He pulls another out, then hands it to

Jonson.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

A romantic tragedy. In iambic

pentameter.

JONSON

(amazed)

All, my lord? Is that possible?

OXFORD

Of course it is!

Jonson exits Oxford's study, still amazed at the

manuscript as he walks.

He passes ANNE, Oxford's wife (now 40's), who is on her

way to the study with their eldest daughter, BRIDGET

(17).

55

pg. 56

She watches him go by and immediately realizes that she

has seen him before. But she stays silent.

Oxford is writing at a desk as Anne enters.

ANNE

Who was that man?    I've seen him

before.

Oxford holds up a finger to prevent her from speaking

while he finishes writing a thought. It's a long

thought. Anne is obviously annoyed, and interrupts

him.

ANNE (CONT'D)

Edward-- we must discuss our Bridget's

dowry.

OXFORD

(looking up - confused)

Dowry?

He remembers when he spies his daughter.

ANNE

She cannot go into marriage without a

dowry that is becoming to the daughter

of the Earl Oxford.

OXFORD

I can give her Brooke House and a

hundred pounds.

BRIDGET

A hundred pounds? Father?     Mother!

OXFORD

That is all we have to give at the

moment.

The matter over, Oxford goes back to his writing.

ANNE

(furious)

Edward. Edward! Speak to me! Our

family is in financial ruins, and, and

you, you play the flute while Rome

burns!

Oxford turns.

56

pg. 57

OXFORD

Nero fiddled whilst Rome burned.

ANNE

For god's sake, who cares Edward?

When your own daughter can't even have

a suitable dowry?

ANNE (CONT'D)

My god, you're writing again, aren't

you? After you agreed-- after my

father expressly forbade it!

OXFORD

Anne-- If you could have seen them--

the mob... They, they didn't just sit

there like the reptilia of court,

faces motionless, fangs momentarily

retracted. No! They, they jumped on

stage, they fought the French! A

butcher-- he actually broke his arm!

He was so--

ANNE

Stop!   Stop it at once!!

ANNE (CONT'D)

Why!? Why must you write?! Why must

you continue to humiliate this family?

OXFORD

The voices, Anne... The voices. I, I

can't stop them... They, they come

when I sleep, when I wake, when I sup,

when I, I, I walk down a hall! The

sweet longings of a maiden, the, the

surging ambitions of a courtier, the

foul designs of a murderer, the

wretched pleas of his victims.    Only-

- only when I put their words-- their

voices-- to parchment are they cast

loose, freed... Only then is my

mind... quieted... at peace.

pg. 58

Anne steps back, frightened of him.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

I... would go mad if I didn't write

down the voices.

She stares at him, horrified.

ANNE

Art thou possessed?

He stares back at her.   A long beat

OXFORD

I... don't know.

SHAKESPEARE (O.S.)

"Two households, both alike in

dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay

our scene"

Shakespeare and Jonson are walking along London Bridge--

the only bridge that spanned the Thames at the time, it

is a street lined with multi-storied buildings-- almost

like a mall.

Shakespeare caries and reads from a manuscript of

"Romeo and Juliet"

SHAKESPEARE

"From ancient grudge break to new

mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil

hands unclean."

(no longer reading)

Incredible!! The whole bloody thing

in verse?!

JONSON

(nonchalant)

It's really not that difficult, if you

try.

SHAKESPEARE

And have you ever tried?

Jonson gives him a sharp look, and pauses to pick some

onions from a stand.

Shakespeare notices a BUXOM BLONDE women selling apples

at the next stand.

58

pg. 59

SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)

(performing for the

Blonde)

"But soft, what light through yonder

window breaks?

It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious

moon,

Who is already sick and pale with

grief, That thou her maid art far more

fair than she."

SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)

(to Jonson)

I'll have little trouble parting the

legs of barmaids after that

performance!

JONSON

You can't play Romeo.

SHAKESPEARE

(to Jonson)

Why not? I won't let that oaf Spencer

have another go at one of my roles.

No-- only Will Shakespeare can pump

the life into Romeo's veins.

(grins at another passing

girl)

And his cod piece!

(beat, desperate)

Ben-- Ben! I'm an actor, every inch

of me, down to my very toes... I want-

- no, I need, crave-- to act. I can't

just idle the day by with--

JONSON

So bloody well act like a writer! And

for God's sake, keep off the stage.

Writers don't have time to act.

DISSOLVE TO:

59

pg. 60

A performance of "Romeo and Juliet". About a dozen

actors are dancing. It is Act 1, Scene 5. "ROMEO",

played by Spencer, is staring longingly at "Juliet".

"Romeo" turns to his servant.

"ROMEO"

What lady's that, which doth enrich

the hand of yonder knight?

"SERVANT"

I know not, sir.

"ROMEO"

O, she doth teach the torches to burn

bright! It seems she hangs upon the

cheek of night like a rich jewel in an

Ethiop's ear; beauty too rich for use,

for earth too dear!

The actor playing Romeo plays to the women in the

audience. And

THE WOMEN

respond, eye lashes twittering.

THE WITS

Watch in awe!   Now they're all taking swigs of ale.

BACKSTAGE

Shakespeare mouthing silently the lines of "Romeo".

IN OXFORD'S BOX

Oxford watches the dance carefully.

"ROMEO" (CONT'D)

Did my heart love till now? Forswear

it, sight! For I ne'er saw true

beauty till this night.

DISSOLVE TO:

Twenty-eight years earlier. A dance is taking place.

YOUNG OXFORD-- now 20 is dancing with Young Anne.     But

his eyes are on:

60

pg. 61

YOUNG ELIZABETH

My lord of Oxford.

YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

We liked your play tonight very much.

Your young King Henry reminded us of

you.

OXFORD

Did he?

YOUNG ELIZABETH

Rash, yet brave. A boy-- and yet a

man. Fair on the eyes, fairer to the

ear...

YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

We are glad of your return from the

continent. Two years is far too long

to be without such excellent

amusements.

61

pg. 62

YOUNG OXFORD

If I had known my absence would cause

your grace so much... longing, I would

have returned much-- much-- sooner.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

Your wife must be much pleased by your

presence once more at her side...

YOUNG OXFORD

If she is, it is but a small comfort

to me. I am returned only under my

father-in-law's insistence.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

(surprised)

Cecil had told me your match was one

of love.

YOUNG OXFORD

And so he would wish.

(long beat)

But how could one ever love the moon,

after having first seen the sun?

DISSOLVE TO:

62

pg. 63

Three Ladies-in-waiting run onto the balcony to join

Bessie, who is looking across the palace grounds,

watching--

Young Elizabeth and Young Oxford, both on horseback,

unaccompanied, trot over a small bridge.

The Ladies-in-waiting giggle, but are interrupted by--

WILLIAM CECIL (O.S.)

Where is her majesty?

Bessie turns to William Cecil.

BESSIE

My lord. Her majesty went riding with

the Earl of Oxford.

The Ladies-in-waiting share knowing smiles.

Young Elizabeth and Young Oxford share flirty glances,

and then Young Elizabeth spurs her horse to a gallop,

and dashes into the fog. Young Oxford immediately

follows.

CUT TO:

A servant places a silver plate filled with shucked

oysters onto a table filled with quail, venison, wine,

etc...

Young Elizabeth sits across from Young Oxford.   It's

just the two of them dining.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

And which country did you like the

most on your travels, my lord?

YOUNG OXFORD

I think Italy, your grace.

63

pg. 64

YOUNG ELIZABETH

And why is that? The weather?       The

food?

YOUNG OXFORD

No their theater, which they call la

Commedia dell'arte. And, of course,

the women.

She raises an eyebrow.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

The women?

YOUNG OXFORD

They were more... clear with their

desires than our English ladies. When

they want something, they take it.

They do not wait to be taken...

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

A door SLAMS open, and Young Elizabeth and Young Oxford

dash in, ripping each others clothes off in the

fireplace-lit room.

Young Elizabeth gently pushes Young Oxford towards her

throne... She kisses him. Then begin to make love.

On the throne.

DISSOLVE TO:

LATER

Postcoital, the fire still lit. Young Elizabeth is

half asleep, half awake, nestled in furs in front of

the fireplace... much like Titania in "Midsummer

Night's Dream"...

Young Oxford watches her as she stirs and wakes.      She

smiles at him.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

I can't decide. Are you Prince

Hal...? Or Romeo? No. Benedick,

maybe...?

No--

--Puck

YOUNG OXFORD

(smiles)

Puck?

YOUNG ELIZABETH

Yes, Puck!

YOUNG OXFORD

Ah, but Puck would never fight for you

in the Netherlands...

YOUNG ELIZABETH

(surprised, smiles)

The Netherlands?

YOUNG OXFORD

Well, why not? It's an open secret on

the continent that you support the

rebels against Spain-- and that you

are commissioning Englishmen to help

their cause. Spain's loss is

England's gain, is it not?

YOUNG ELIZABETH

Is this why you bedded me? For a

commission?

YOUNG OXFORD

No.   No-- of course not--    I--

YOUNG ELIZABETH

Leave me.    Leave at once!

YOUNG OXFORD

Bess--

YOUNG ELIZABETH

How dare you! How dare you!! I

command you to leave my presence.

65

pg. 66

YOUNG OXFORD

O Mistress mine, where are you

roaming?

O stay and hear... your true-love's

coming,

That can--

(looks up and down her

body)

--kiss both high and low...

YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)

Trip no further, pretty sweeting....

YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)

Journeys end in lovers' meeting--

Every wise man's son doth know.

YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)

What is love? 'tis not hereafter;

Present mirth hath present laughter;

What's to come is still unsure:

YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)

In delay there lies no plenty--

Then come kiss me, Sweet-and-twenty,

Youth's a stuff will not endure.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

(passionately)

You will stay in England... And in...

my chambers...

66

pg. 67

The flash of disappointment on Young Oxford's face

about that last bit is tempered by Young Elizabeth's

sheet falling to the floor. They begin to make love

passionately once more.

NASHE (O.S.)

I could do it if I wanted to...

Twenty-seven years later. Jonson, Marlowe, Dekker and

Nashe sit silently at a table, mugs of ale in hand.

Having just returned from "Romeo and Juliet", all are a

bit in shock. The actors from the perfomance are there

as well in the BG.

MARLOWE

(to Nashe)

Do what?

NASHE

(a little drunk)

A play in iambic, in iambic pen...in-

bic-pentameter. It's not that hard.

JONSON

Think you so? Have you ever tried?

NASHE

Of course not. But I could if I

wanted...

DEKKER

It wasn't all in verse.

NASHE

Ha!   See!   Even easier!

Shakespeare enters and makes a bee line for them.

SHAKESPEARE

(excited)

Henslowe wants "Romeo" to run a

fortnight.

(unbelievable news)

A fortnight! Innkeeper! A round for

everybody! Inkeeper!!

(no response)

Billy!!!

And Shakespeare goes over to the bar.

67

pg. 68

NASHE

A fortnight?

DEKKER

The maids love the romantic tragedies.

MARLOWE

Precisely why I avoid them.

NASHE

Aw, well. No worries. A one-trick

pony. He'll never be able to do it

again.

A MONTAGE of various plays:

"TWELFTH NIGHT"

Viola and Sebastian are reunited...

"CAESAR"

Caesar is attacked by Brutus, Cinna, Cassius, etc...

"MACBETH"

The witches are on stage.

These three performances are INTER-CUT with:

PLAYBILLS

outside the Rose, announcing each play's title.      At

first, Shakespeare's name is small, with each

succeeding play his name gets bigger. And--

AFTER EACH PERFORMANCE

Shakespeare bows to the ever-increasing applause of his

audience. He looks up to see the Mermaid's Wits all

watching him with stony silence.

And as each play is seen, Jonson and the rest of the

Wits seem more and more depressed.

And after each performance, Shakespeare seems to be

greeted with more and more adulation.

The MONTAGE ends with...

68

pg. 69

A PLAYBILL

in front of the theater announcing "William

Shakespeare's Hamlet". Shakespeare's name is now above

the title. We HEAR the audience howl with LAUGHTER as--

An actor playing "POLONIUS" does an obvious caricature

of William Cecil, dressed in black with an exaggerated

rendition of Cecil's beard.

"POLONIUS"

(over-acting)

...Beware of entrance to a quarrel,

but being in, bear it that the opposed

may beware of thee. Give every man

thy ear, but few thy voice, take each

man's censure, but reserve thy

judgment....

Elizabeth watches the same play at a court performance.

We see Elizabeth smiling amused as "Polinous" continues

his rant...

"POLINOUS"

....Costly thy habit as thy purse can

buy, but not expressed in fancy, rich,

nor gaudy, for the apparel oft

proclaims the man. This above all, to

thine own self be true.

Elizabeth absent mindedly starts to scratch her chest,

irritated by some sort of itch, but still focused on

the play.

Jonson watches tight lipped...

The character of GERTRUDE", the Queen, is joined by

"HAMLET". "Polonius" is behind a curtain, listening

in, and is seen by the audience. "Hamlet" appears

enraged.

"GERTRUDE"

What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not

murder me? Help, ho!

69

pg. 70

"POLONIUS"

(behind curtain)

What ho, help!

"Hamlet" draws his sword.

"HAMLET"

How now?   A rat? Dead, for a ducat,

dead!

"Hamlet" stabs "Polonius" through the curtain.

"POLONIUS"

O, I am slain.

"Polonius" emerges from behind the curtain, covered in

pig's blood, and dies an anguished death.

There is stunned silence in the audience. And then one

lone Groundling CLAPS, then another, then the whole

audience.

GROUNDLING

Not a day too soon for old Cecil!!

Elizabeth is still scratching her chest, but more

vigorously as some of the members of court give

uncomfortable glances at each other over the death of

William Cecil-- er "Polonius" onstage.

"GERTRUDE"

O me, what hast thou done?

"HAMLET"

Nay, I know not. Is it the King?

"HAMLET" (CONT'D)

Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool,

farewell! I took thee for thy better:

take thy fortune; Thou find'st to be

too busy is some danger. Leave

wringing of your hands: peace! sit you

down, And let me wring your heart; for

so I shall, If it be made of

penetrable stuff,

If damned custom have not brass'd it

so

That it is proof and bulwark against

sense.

70

pg. 71

Elizabeth can't take the itching anymore. She RIPS

open her bodice and violently scratches some sort of

rash on her chest.

Oxford is in his usual box, but completely alone.   He

has a smile of satisfaction on his lips while...

JONSON

Looks over to Oxford with astonishment... While on

stage the world sees for the first time "Hamlet"

contemplating suicide.

"HAMLET"

To be, or not to be: that is the

question: whether `tis nobler in the

mind to suffer the slings and arrows

of outrageous fortune, or to take arms

against a sea of troubles, and by

opposing end them...

Loud thunder and...

RAIN STARTS TO FALL

And as only the stage and the galleries are covered,

the groundlings are pelted with the cold drops of

water. But they stay. They stay. They cover

themselves up, and silently watch on.

"HAMLET'

...To die, to sleep- no more- and by a

sleep to say we end the heartache, and

the thousand natural shocks that flesh

is heir to...

The audience-- soaked, pelted with rain-- watches

immobile.

And then a again a loud thunder clap takes us to the

end of the play...

SHAKESPEARE

Bows to the thunderous applause. It is still raining,

but nobody wants to leave. While-

THE MERMAID'S WITS

watch in the crowd, a complex range of emotions, but

jealousy and loathing at the top of the list.

71

pg. 72

ON STAGE

some of the audience members grab Shakespeare, and pull

him on their shoulders, carrying him triumphantly out

of the theater.

CUT TO:

Marlowe walks towards the Tower of London.

Silence....Marlowe is waiting patiently...

He is sitting across from Pole, the Captain of the

Guard, who is reading his report....

POLE

(looks up)

Are you certain of this?

(almost confused)

William Cecil was murdered?

MARLOWE

Not literally, of course. He was a

character, a fictional character. But

the metaphor was clear for anyone to

see. And see, they did.

Pole reads more from the parchment.

MARLOWE (CONT'D)

Will you shut it down?

Pole continues to read.

POLE

That is not for me to decide...

He brings out a pouch of coins, and tosses it across

the table.

POLE (CONT'D)

Your service to his lordship is once

again greatly appreciated.

Marlowe takes the pouch of money.

pg. 73

ROBERT CECIL (O.S.)

He butchered you!

Robert Cecil is furious, pacing back and forth in front

of William Cecil, who sits behind a large wooden desk.

William Cecil is pale and sweaty-- he is deathly ill,

and sits in a wooden chair with small spoked wheels

attached to the legs-- sort of an Elizabethan

wheelchair.

ROBERT CECIL

Not only in front of Court! But the

entire City as well! We must arrest

this Shakespeare and-

WILLIAM CECIL

No, Robert, think. If he is really as

popular as you say, we would only

anger the mob. No. We must strike at

Edward directly.

William Cecil slowly-- and shakily-- bends down from

his chair as--

ROBERT CECIL

But we cannot maintain our authority

if the mob thinks us laughing stocks--

WILLIAM CECIL

(angry)

Our authority comes from Elizabeth and

from God! Elizabeth! Elizabeth is

the key to all.

Robert Cecil looks hurt by his father's anger.

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

(gentler)

Robert... You must think deeper. You

must compensate. Compensate for

your... malformations... with the

gifts God did grant you... With

cunning. With ruthlessness.

William Ceci pushes a hidden button on the side of his

desk-- a spring loaded secret drawer POPS open. Robert

Cecil has never seen it before.

Cecil produces a folded piece of parchment from the

drawer, offers it to Robert Cecil.

73

pg. 74

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

From King James of Scotland.

Robert Cecil looks surprised.

Robert Cecil is pushing William Cecil in his

wheelchair. They are completely alone.

WILLIAM CECIL

James knows of the Queen's affection

for Essex... and the rumors of his

birth. He is justly concerned.

(beat)

You will reply to him.

ROBERT CECIL

I will reply to him?

WILLIAM CECIL

I am dying, Robert--

(before Robert can

protest)

We both know this to be true. And I

will not witness the next coronation.

LATER

Robert Cecil wheels his father in.

WILLIAM CECIL

Help me to my bed, my son.

(Robert Cecil does so)

If we are to secure your place at the

side of the next king, you must get

that king his throne, not I.

A beat as this registers on Robert Cecil.

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

You will write to James that I am

gravely ill, but that all is in hand.

Much of the Privy Council has already

secretly agreed to his ascension to

the English throne due to your

tireless, but secret, entreaties on

his behalf.

(beat)

And then tell him Essex will not

return from Ireland alive.

74

pg. 75

Robert Cecil looks surprised.

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

This is how kings are made, Robert.

So it was with Elizabeth, and so it

shall ever be. There were many rival

claims to her throne, but none

survived to make their claim. James

must know that you will do the same

for him, and he will reward you for

it.

(beat)

But we must do one thing more...

William Cecil has a coughing fit-- reaches for a glass

vial of medicine at his bedside-- takes it.

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

Like Essex, Edward must be removed.

ROBERT CECIL

(confused)

Edward?

William Cecil is slowly falling asleep...

WILLIAM CECIL

He uses the tools at his disposal, as

we use the tools at ours. But ours

will win... as they always have.

ROBERT CECIL

(more confused)

I-- I don't understand, father.    What

does Edward--

WILLIAM CECIL

Edward seeks what we seek.   To choose

the next King.

Off Robert Cecil's surprised face we hear:

YOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.)

I am with child...

CUT TO:

Twenty seven years earlier. Young Elizabeth is pacing,

terribly agitated. Bessie, the lady-in-waiting we have

seen constantly at her side is the only other person

present.

75

pg. 76

WILLIAM CECIL

Are you certain?

BESSIE

Two cycles have passed, my lord.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

I wish to marry him...

WILLIAM CECIL

Marry him, your grace? He is already

married.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

I can do what I will.

WILLIAM CECIL

Can you?

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

Most of the Catholic princes of Europe

wish to topple you and end your

Protestant reign... The only things

that stop them are the channel, and

the hope that they might marry you,

and thereby achieve your realm through

other means.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

I love him...

WILLIAM CECIL

Would you risk your throne for him?

Would you risk England for him?

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

We must do as we have done before...

You must go on Progress, somewhere

isolated, accompanied by only those

whom you most trust.

(MORE)

76

pg. 77

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

After the birth, I will find a

suitable house for the child to be

reared in.

Young Elizabeth is uncertain.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

And Edward?

WILLIAM CECIL

He must never know.

A simple, cold space, like William Cecil himself.

William Cecil is alone in prayer. A few beats, then he

senses he is not alone. He turns and sees Young Oxford

(still 20).

YOUNG OXFORD

What have you done?

WILLIAM CECIL

I am praying.

YOUNG OXFORD

(ignoring him)

She won't see me! I've gone to her

chambers three times, and she will not

receive me. And now she's gone!

William Cecil regards Young Oxford for a beat, then

stands.

WILLIAM CECIL

She's on Progress.

With this he leaves the chapel.

Young Oxford runs after him.

YOUNG OXFORD

Where?   Where did she go?

William Cecil is silent.

YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)

What did you say to her? Tell me!

77

pg. 78

WILLIAM CECIL

The Queen does not ask for my advice

about matters of the heart, Edward.

If she had, she hardly would have

chosen you for her pleasure.

He has a point.

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

You must have known her eye would move

elsewhere, Edward. It always has.

You are neither the first, nor the

last, of her lovers.

Young Oxford looks up at him like a bucket of cold

water has hit him.

William Cecil stops. He looks at Oxford with a stern

face.

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

Go back to my daughter, Edward. She

will accept you with open arms, as she

always has. Behave as your great

title demands you behave. Tend to

your estates, your investments.

(a beat)

And make me a grandson, an heir!

Off Young Oxford's pained expression.

CUT TO:

Twenty-seven years later. Jonson is alone, trying to

write at a small table, though it's obvious from his

fits and starts and crossing outs that he is having

difficulty.

MARLOWE (O.S.)

It's difficult to write, isn't it?

After watching something like

"Hamlet"...

Jonson looks up. Marlowe sits, uninvited.    Jonson

looks annoyed at the interruption.

MARLOWE (CONT'D)

I've seen you watch him. Will.

During a performance. It eats at

you... at your soul...

78

pg. 79

MARLOWE (CONT'D)

Why do you think Will hasn't been

arrested? You or I make the slightest

joke about a nobleman of no

consequence, and we find ourselves in

a cell quicker than a fart spreads in

the trade winds. Will-- he murders a

caricature of old William Cecil

himself, and still whores all the way

to Westminster and back.

JONSON

(shrugs)

Perhaps they haven't noticed..

MARLOWE

I made sure they did...

JONSON

You informed on one of your own?   To

the Tower?

MARLOWE

Watch who you judge, Ben, for as God

is my witness, you may well find

yourself doing the same before you

meet your maker. We do what we have

to, to survive, and survive well, in

this life. All of us. And Will is

definitely not one of us. You know

he's illiterate, don't you?

MARLOWE (CONT'D)

No? Oh, he can read well enough-- how

else could he learn his lines? But

the man never actually learned to form

his letters.

JONSON

Why are you here, Kit?

MARLOWE

(smiles)

So who did write it? You?   No.    You'd

take credit for it. No...

(MORE)

79

pg. 80

MARLOWE (CONT'D)

It must be someone who wants their

anonymity protected. Someone who

might even pay to have it protected.

Jonson is getting nervous.

MARLOWE (CONT'D)

A nobleman.

Jonson looks up.   Marlowe smiles, knowing he is closer

to the truth.

MARLOWE (CONT'D)

But which?    You know, don't you, Ben?

JONSON

You've had too much to drink, Kit.

You're beginning to sound like one of

your plays.

Jonson stands and hurries out of the Tavern.

Jonson heads down the street, Marlowe chasing after

him.

MARLOWE

Ben! Tell me. We can go to him

together. Guarantee his anonymity...

for a price.

JONSON

You reported on me as well, didn't

you, Kit? Last year. That's why I

was arrested, wasn't it? Because you

went to the Tower?

MARLOWE

(lying)

Ben, Ben... I had nothing to do with

that.

Jonson studies Marlowe for a beat and then walks away.

MARLOWE (CONT'D)

Ben-- I'll just go to Will! He'll

tell me because he has so much more to

lose than you. Fame. Fortune. And

you'll profit nothing from it.

Nothing!

But Jonson is gone.

80

pg. 81

A military encampment with dozens of tents on a cliff

by the Irish seaside.

CLOSER

Essex's tent is larger, and guarded. An OLD SERVANT

carrying a tray with a silver pitcher approaches. A

guard opens the tent for him to enter.

INT. ESSEX'S TENT - CONTINUOUS

Essex is having a Council of War with his generals and

senior officers, including Southampton. They all stand

around a table, consulting a map of Ireland.

ESSEX

(pointing)

If the Rebels have stripped the

northern borders... Then we must

march south... and take Cahir

Castle...

The SERVANT stays in the background as he pours wine

into various goblets. Southampton notices him-- the

servant's hand shakes as he pours the wine.

GENERAL

(clears throat,

uncomfortable)

My lord. `Tis a well-defended

fortress.    Two thousand men at

least. We cannot--

Southampton notices the Servant's shaking hand slipping

into a pocket as--

ESSEX

So what would you have me do? Spend

the entire spring encamped? I am sent

to Ireland to end this infernal

rebellion, not idle my days with--

SOUTHAMPTON

Robert!

In an instant Southampton draws a silver engraved

pistol and SHOOTS the servant!

Everyone is shocked-- but then we see:

81

pg. 82

THE SERVANT

had drawn his own, small wooden pistol.

ESSEX

shares a look with Southampton.

To Establish. A foggy day. In the Foreground we see

the maze. Oxford and his fencing master, BEAULIEU

(20's) are in the center of the maze dueling with

rapiers for exercise.

CLOSER

They wear outfits that are slightly more protective

than ornamental.

They duel for a few moments, and then Oxford TOUCHES

Beaulieu's shoulder. The speak entirely in French.

BEAULIEU

Point!

Oxford backs off, as does the fencing master.

OXFORD

(in French)

Bien. Faisons du travail... le Coup

droit d'autorite?

BEAULIE

Mais oui, mon seigneur.

OXFORD

Bien.    En garde!

And they once again begin to duel. But we quickly

surmise something is amiss. Beaulieu is much more

aggressive than he was before. Oxford realizes it, but

is an expert swordsman, and defends himself well.

And then Beaulieu aggressively moves forward, and STABS

Oxford in the leg.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

Qu'est ce que vous faites?

But Oxford has little chance to react, because Beaulieu

continues his attack.

82

pg. 83

OXFORD (CONT'D)

Beaulieu?    Beaulieu?!

This has become an assassination attempt, not an

exercise.

ENTRANCE OF THE MAZE

Francesco is entering the maze with a silver tray

carrying a pitcher and two goblets.

CENTER OF THE MAZE

Though wounded, Oxford is a superior swordsman. And he

begins his own attack-- with a ferocity that surprises

Beaulieu.

IN THE MAZE

Francesco heads for the center as--

IN THE CENTER OF THE MAZE

Oxford PIERCES Beaulieu's heart with his rapier, and

Beaulieu SCREAMS--

IN THE MAZE

Francesco hears the scream, and starts to run.

FRANCESCO

Signor?    Signor?!

IN THE CENTER OF THE MAZE

Oxford collapses as Francesco rushes in.

FRANCESCO (CONT'D)

Signor? Mio dio! Signor! What has

happened--

Oxford checks his leg wound, and glances at the dead

Beaulieu. He tries to wave off Franceso's aid, but to

no avail as--

OXFORD

Beaulieu-- he, he tried to kill me...

Jonson, slightly drunk, walks down a street, a whore

under his arm, and notices a commotion up ahead: people

talking by an alley near the Mermaid's tavern.

83

pg. 84

JONSON

(to a passer-by)

What's all that, then?

MAN

A body...

Jonson peers over and sees:

A BODY

on its back in the alley. Someone turns it over.    It's

MARLOWE, a dried stab-wound in his eye.

JONSON

is stunned.

MAN (CONT'D)

Must have been a cut-purse. Nowhere's

bloody safe anymore, I'll tell you

that...

CUT TO:

A small, open air theater where a chained bear is being

led around the theater. A set of mastiffs are being

led on the opposite side of the theater.

The spectators are unruly, loudly making bets for the

mauling to come.

Jonson is among them, taking a look at the bear, deciding

whether to bet on it or not.

BEAR BAITER

Sampson! Sired by the great Arthur

himself! No dog's yet been bred that can

take him down!

Shakespeare suddenly sits next Jonson hardly notices.

SHAKESPEARE

I need more money.

JONSON

More--? You already make more than any

playwright Bankside.

84

pg. 85

BEAR BAITER

But then here, good friends, I bring you

a pack of dogs so fierce, so dangerous,

that Medusa herself would shrink in fear!

SHAKESPEARE

I'm going to build my own theater, Ben,

one that fits the scale of my work--

JONSON

Your work?

BEAR BAITER

Not a one has had a morsel of food in a

week! Bred by the great John Sinclow!

A MAN

Fourpence on three dogs!

SHAKESPEARE

They insist only a gentleman can own the

land.

ANOTHER MAN

A shilling on four!

SHAKESPEARE

The bribes are outrageous, but I found

some one who will make me a coat-of-arms,

and change the Stratford lists for me.

JONSON

Impossible.

ANOTHER MAN

Eight shillings on six dogs!   Eight

shillings on six dogs!

JONSON

I'll take that bet!!   Eight shillings on

the bear, six dogs!

ANOTHER MAN

Done!

SHAKESPEARE

Bad bet, that.

JONSON

(to Shakespeare)

You'll have to make do with what

you've got. I won't be your beggar.

85

pg. 86

SHAKESPEARE

This isn't a request, Ben.   I'll have

more money.

JONSON

Or what? You'll slit my throat like

you did Kit's?

MAN

Release the dogs!   Release the dogs!

JONSON

I know he went to see you last night,

Will. And I know he was planning to

expose you if you didn't agree to his

terms.

SHAKESPEARE

(dead serious)

You're mad, Ben. Kit was my friend.

JONSON

Be careful, Will. You kill me off

too, and you won't have any good plays

to act in after this is all done.

SHAKESPEARE

I'll have my guineas, Ben. One way or

another, I'll have my guineas.

CUT TO:

86

pg. 87

SHAKESPEARE

Wears a beard and fake nose. He tries to stay hidden so

Jonson doesn't see him. We are:

Jonson is waiting not far from him by a stand and

drinks an ale.

Then Oxford's servant, Francesco, appears.

After the two men have exchanged couple of words,

Francesco gives Jonson a leather folder containing a

manuscript and a purse jingling with coin. Jonson

takes them and leaves.

Jonson safely gone, Shakespeare starts to follow

Francesco who heads back over the bridge.

Shakespeare is in a small boat following Francesco, who

is in Oxford's boat. They head towards Oxford Stone.

EXT. OXFORD STONE - DUSK

Shakespeare watches as Francesco enters Oxford Stone.

CUT TO:

Shakespeare is waiting, clearly uncomfortable. It's

not the kind of room he's used to being in. He holds

his wig and his nose.

A door opens, and Oxford enters, walking on a stick

because of his leg injury. He is followed by his

servant, Francesco.

OXFORD

So! You are the famous Shakespeare

whose labors I have enjoyed so much.

I am at your service, sir.

87

pg. 88

SHAKESPEARE

My lord-- I- I need more money.

OXFORD

(sharp)

I beg your pardon?

SHAKESPEARE

My expenses have, ah, aggrandized...

since this all began.

OXFORD

"Aggrandized"?

SHAKESPEARE

And if, if your lordship doesn't agree

to an increase in my, ah, fee, I shall

be forced to make certain... facts

public.

FRANCESCO

Have you any idea to whom you are

speaking?

SHAKESPEARE

I am addressing the writer of

Hamlet... of Juliet and her Romeo.   Am

I not?

FRANCESCO

Out. Get out! How dare you insult my

master in--

OXFORD

Wait!

(beat)

How much?

SHAKESPEARE

Four hundred pounds. A year.

FRANCESCO

A year?

OXFORD

Pay him.

88

pg. 89

Francesco is shocked.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

(impatient, in Italian)

Pagalo!

Shakespeare smiles.

Shakespeare exits, tossing a leather pouch filled with

coins. He smiles.

Oxford watches Shakespeare walk down the road through a

window.

FRANCESCO

Forgive me for speaking of things

above my place or understanding,

signor. But... Is this wise? They

have already tried to kill you once.

OXFORD

Wisdom, Francesco, is a quality I have

unfortunately never possessed...

Francesco stares at Oxford who is deep in thought.

The sound of heated love making takes us to...

Twenty-five years earlier. Young Oxford (now 25 and

with a beard) is making love to someone. We can't tell

who at first, and assume it is Elizabeth. And then we

see, it's BESSIE, Young Elizabeth's lady-in-waiting.

DISSOLVE TO:

An hour later, post-coital. A fire is burning, and

Bessie is finishing dressing herself.

BESSIE

Edward... You know she would be

furious if she found out about this...

89

pg. 90

Young Oxford doesn't answer. He is deep in thought.

BESSIE (CONT'D)

She still loves you.

YOUNG OXFORD

No.   She abandoned me.

BESSIE

You don't know, do you?

He looks at her quizzically.

BESSIE (CONT'D)

The Queen.   She had your child.

A carriage drives towards the house.

Young Anne de Vere holds her sleeping daughter in her

arms.

Bessie carefully closes Oxford's bedroom door and

suddenly freezes.

She turns and sees Young Oxford's wife with her little

daughter at her side standing in the hallway staring at

her.

For a moment nobody dares to move, then Bessie rushes

off...

WILLIAM CECIL

I cannot be certain, majesty, when

the... relationship began.

CUT TO:

Young Elizabeth looks out a window, obviously

distressed. William Cecil is across from her, his face

tense.

90

pg. 91

WILLIAM CECIL

But sometime soon after your return to

Court.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

You're sure?

WILLIAM CECIL

They-- they haven't been very

discreet, majesty. I presume he

wanted you to know. To... to hurt

you.

She is crushed.

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

Majesty, there is more. The lady is

pregnant.

Young Elizabeth freezes, stunned.   Then--

YOUNG ELIZABETH

Arrest them.    Arrest them both!

William Cecil bows and exits.

Now alone, Young Elizabeth lets her emotions out.   She

picks up a vase and THROWS it into a wall.

From high above, we see a carriage arrive.    It stops,

and William Cecil gets out.

Young Oxford (now 26) is looking out a window at the

river beyond. He has been imprisoned for some months.

His beard has become ragged, his clothes have seen

better days.

William Cecil enters.

WILLIAM CECIL

Your whore gave birth last week.

Young Oxford turns to William Cecil. The stare at each

other for a beat.

91

pg. 92

WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

The Queen has decided to release you.

It seems time does indeed heal all

wounds.

(beat)

These are her conditions for your

release. One. You will not

acknowledge the child. Two. You will

never see the mother again. Three.

You will avoid Court at all costs.

Her majesty would prefer not to be

reminded of you in any way ever again.

YOUNG OXFORD

Banished...?

WILLIAM CECIL

No. You have the freedom of the

kingdom. Just not of the Court.

(beat)

Those are her terms. Here are mine.

You will go back to my daughter. You

will make some effort to make her

happy and you will finally act

according to your station in life, and

accept the responsibilities of your

great title.

YOUNG OXFORD

My lord!     I, too, have a condition.

YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)

I will go back to your daughter if...

You tell me the name of the child.

WILLIAM CECIL

I don't know if the whore has even

delivered the--

YOUNG OXFORD

No.   The other one.

WILLIAM CECIL

The other one?

(realizing)

Who told you?

92

pg. 93

Cecil is obviously annoyed by this development.

YOUNG OXFORD

I will go back to your daughter. I

will make you as many grandchildren as

she can bare...

William Cecil thinks.

YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)

Or I can remain here...

William Cecil decides.

WILLIAM CECIL

There is no record of his true birth,

no trail that leads to you, or the...

mother. His foster parents never knew

the truth, and both are now dead...

YOUNG OXFORD

The name?

WILLIAM CECIL

Make even a hint of this to the child,

or anyone else, and this agreement is

void, and I'll see your head on the

block within a fortnight. And the

boy's as well.

YOUNG OXFORD

(excited)

It's a boy...?

Young Oxford (cleaned up) is watching a BOY about five

years old dueling with a tutor. The boy is quite good.

The boy notices Young Oxford, and stops duelling.

BOY

Hello...

YOUNG OXFORD

Hello.

Young Oxford smiles at the boy.

YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)

I'm Edward, the Earl of Oxford.

93

pg. 94

BOY

My lord...

The Boy bows, a serious expression on his face.

YOUNG OXFORD

They tell me one day you're to be an

Earl as well.

BOY

I shall be the Earl of Southampton.

YOUNG OXFORD

(smiling)

Well then, we shall be Earls together,

shan't we?

CUT TO:

Twenty-five years later. William Cecil's body is in

state, in his coffin, in the center of the apse.

ELIZABETH

looking completely stricken, approaches the coffin,

holding Cecil's white cane. She places it at his side.

In the background we hear the Archbishop of Canterbury

reading from the bible.

ARCHBISHOP (O.S.)

... In the sweat of thy face shalt

thou eat bread, till thou return to

the earth: for out of it wast thou

taken, because thou art dust, and to

dust shalt thou return...

ROBERT CECIL

scans the room, to see how it is all playing out.

OXFORD

watches stoically, his wife and children at his side.

94

pg. 95

The funeral over, Elizabeth exits the portal of

Westminster Abbey and heads to her carriage. A huge

crowd of mourners has assembled.

Robert Cecil steps into place right behind her.

ELIZABETH

We wish to recall Essex from

Ireland...

Robert Cecil is instantly concerned, but hides it well.

They continue to walk.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

We feel a terrible void, now that your

father is no longer at our side...

Robert Cecil bows his head as he walks.

ROBERT CECIL

A wise decision, your majesty. If

nothing else, it will give him an

opportunity to respond to all these

rumors.

Still walking, she turns to him sharply.

ELIZABETH

Rumors?

ROBERT CECIL

I'm sorry, majesty, I thought you'd

heard.

ELIZABETH

Heard what?

ROBERT CECIL

Essex is in negotiations with Philip

of Spain...

ELIZABETH

Peace is at hand. We know this.

ROBERT CECIL

Majesty-- it is said that Essex has

promised Phillip all of Catholic

Ireland in return for...

He hesitates.

95

pg. 96

ELIZABETH

In return for what?

ROBERT CECIL

Spain's support of Essex's claim to

the throne of England...

They have arrived at her carriage.

ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)

(beat)

It is, as of yet, just rumor.

ELIZABETH

Bring him to me, William.   Bring him

to me at once!

ROBERT CECIL

(correcting)

Robert, majesty.

Elizabeth stares at him for an instant, then gets into

her carriage, unsure of herself.

ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)

My father's death has been a great

loss for us all...

She ignores him, trying to collect herself. Robert

Cecil turns to the driver, NODS, and the carriage takes

off.

As soon as it is away, Robert Cecil turns and some in

the crowd of commoners begin to BOO at him.

CUT TO:

HORSE HOOVES

as they gallop over emerald green grasses.   We are:

A group of horsemen gallop into Essex's camp. A

MESSENGER jumps off his horse and heads for Essex's

tent.

Where Essex and Southampton are having dinner as the

messenger enters. He bows.

96

pg. 97

MESSENGER

My lord...

He hands him a sealed envelope. Essex takes it, begins

to read. Frowns, SLAMS the parchment down. He looks

into the distance, trying to process what he's just

read.

Southampton picks up the parchment and begins reading.

SOUTHAMPTON

She can't believe this...

ESSEX

Oh, can't she?

SOUTHAMPTON

It's Robert Cecil. He failed to kill

you, now he tries to kill your name.

Essex heads for the flap of the tent.

ESSEX

We leave with the tide!

CUT TO:

Shakespeare enters the tavern carrying a rolled up

parchment. He passes various actors drinking, then

hurries over to Jonson, Nashe and Dekker, who are deep

in drink.

SHAKESPEARE

Well, I've got it!

Shakespeare unravels the parchment.   He puts it on the

table with a flourish.

It shows a coat-of-arms containing a spear and a

falcon. The colors are numerous, and garish.

SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)

The herald just finished it not an

hour ago.

(smiles)

Well?

Everyone is confused by it.

NASHE

It's quite... colorful.

97

pg. 98

DEKKER

What in blazes is it?

SHAKESPEARE

My coat-of-arms! It cost a bloody

fortune, but, by god, you can call me

gentleman now!

DEKKER

I can't quite make out the motto...

Non sanz... Non...

SHAKESPEARE

"Non sanz droict".

NASHE

Not without--

JONSON

Right!? Not without right?

(beat)

You went to him, didn't you? You

lying knave-- you went to him!

SHAKESPEARE

(smiles)

Ben.   Ben! Let me buy you a--

JONSON

What? You've already killed off one

competitor. Now you want another dead

as well?

SHAKESPEARE

I don't know what you mean.   Ben, we

should really--

JONSON

I swore to him I wouldn't tell you his

name. Swore it! Do you have any idea

what he might do to me? Do you?

(to Nashe)

(MORE)

98

pg. 99

JONSON (CONT'D)

He's not even a writer you know. He

can't even--

SHAKESPEARE

Ben-- you've had too much to drink.

Shakespeare grabs Jonson.

JONSON

Unhand me!

Shakespeare backs off. Jonson pulls out a piece of

parchment from his shirt.

JONSON (CONT'D)

Here!

(looks around)

A quill! A quill!

Nashe and Dekker look at each other, slightly

embarrassed. Jonson finds a quill deep in his pants.

He thrusts it at Will, who ignores it.

JONSON (CONT'D)

(re: the parchment)

Go on, Will. Write something for us.

Now. Go on! Amaze us with your

verse. Your wit! No? Try astounding

us with the letter "E". Or an "I"--

it's just a straight line!

Shakespeare stares at him.

SHAKESPEARE

You haven't got any ink.

And he exits.

CUT TO:

Southampton and Essex are on horseback, followed by

several dozen armed retainers, GALLOPING towards the

city of London.

The party rides into the first gate. The palace is the

city residence of the Queen, and is at the edge of the

City.

99

pg. 100

Essex and Southampton jump off their horses.

Essex and Southampton walk quickly down the long

hallway, opening door after door. Servants scurry

behind them, terrified of the intrusion, trying to stop

them. They open the doors into--

The ladies-in-waiting scream in fear when they see the

two men in battle gear.

ESSEX

(to Southampton)

Wait for me.

And he continues on into--

CONTINUOUS

--where Elizabeth is still dressing, putting on make-

up, etc. She is NOT wearing her wig, and is only

wearing her undergarments. She looks quite ugly.

She turns to see Essex, shocked at his intrusion.

Essex FREEZES.   He knows he has just made an enormous

faux-pas.

ESSEX

Majesty, I, I...

She stares at him, horrified to be seen in such a

manner. The she regains her composure and--

ELIZABETH

Get out!   Out!!!

He steps back in horror-- not at her appearance, but

what he has just done. The doors SLAM in front of him

as we--

ELIZABETH (O.S.)

(CONT'D)

The insolence!

100

pg. 101

Elizabeth, now dressed and wearing her wig on her

throne, is raging at Robert Cecil.

ELIZABETH

Who in God's name does he think he is?

Abandoning his post without my leave!

She begins to absent-mindedly unbutton the top of her

bodice.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

Coming into our presence in such a

manner, neither announced nor invited,

half his army in my courtyard. He's

gone mad... mad!

ROBERT CECIL

No. Unfortunately for us, your

majesty, he is quite sane. He simply

believes he is your royal equal.

She turns to him sharply, furious at the thought.

It looks like an armed camp, with part of Essex's army

encamped in the front courtyard. The soldiers are all

tense.

Oxford, followed only by Francesco, rides into the

courtyard. He is immediately surrounded by armed men,

their muskets pointed at him. Oxford raises his hands.

OXFORD

I am Edward, Earl of Oxford.

SOUTHAMPTON

Edward!   Edward! Thank god you're

here.

Southampton comes towards him.

SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)

Elizabeth has revoked all of his royal

licenses! She believes every lie

Cecil tells about him.

(seeing Oxford's wound)

Edward? What happened to your leg?

101

pg. 102

OXFORD

(shrugs)

Nothing.

Oxford continues towards the door. Southampton

follows, his concern for Oxford's wound noticeable.

Oxford, Southampton and Essex are alone. Oxford is

sitting in a chair, while Essex paces impatiently,

Southampton standing between them.

ESSEX

She won't accept my letters. I cannot

get to her. Cecil plans to arrest me

any day. I know it.

(beat and more determined)

But that won't be as easy as he

thinks.

OXFORD

Fight him in London, and you only

validate every rumor and lie Cecil has

ever told about you.

ESSEX

Then what do you suggest I do? Let

myself be arrested so I can be tried

and executed for crimes I did not

commit?

OXFORD

No. I will go to Elizabeth, myself,

alone--

ESSEX

How? Cecil won't let her see a letter

without reading it first.

OXFORD

I won't send her a letter.   I will

send her a book.

Essex looks confused, but Oxford ignores it.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

She will call for me. And while I am

with her, you will come-- not with an

army, not with swords, but with her

loyal subjects. The cobblers, the

tinkers, the bricklayers of London.

(MORE)

102

pg. 103

OXFORD (CONT'D)

All, all calling for Robert Cecil's

banishment from Court. Words, Robert,

words, will prevail with her, not

swords.

Essex looks unsure.

ESSEX

And the mob?    How will I--

OXFORD

Leave that to me.

Oxford is in his rooms, writing feverishly by

candlelight.

He completes a thought... closes the manuscript...

writes down the title with a flourish:

The Tragedie of Richard III

A room for the whores to take their tricks.    Small,

with nothing much beyond a straw bed.

Shakespeare is bedding a buxom young lady.

And then the door OPENS. Francesco enters, and Oxford

follows, holding a manuscript. Shakespeare looks

shocked. She starts to SCREAM and yell as she pulls a

sheet to cover herself.

FRANCESCO

(to the whore)

Hold your tongue, whore, and get out!

She does so as Oxford walks over to Shakespeare. He

tosses the manuscript to him. Shakespeare starts to

look at it. The whore is partially dressed, so--

FRANCESCO (CONT'D)

(to the whore)

Out, woman!

WHORE

Oi.   `Oo's going to pay me then?

103

pg. 104

Shakespeare gives a look to Oxford-- he certainly isn't

going to pay for it.

Oxford nods to Francesco, who gives the whore a few

coins. She smiles, and leaves.

OXFORD

You shall begin rehearsals

immediately. But it is not to be

performed until I tell you. And you

may only have a day's notice.

Shakespeare looks confused.

SHAKESPEARE

That will be expensive-- keeping all

the actors ready. Having the props

made but not--

Oxford tosses a very large pouch of coins at him, and

then begins to leave.

OXFORD

Oh, and congratulations. You've had

an epic poem published today.

SHAKESPEARE

(confused)

Published? You mean like in a book?

Renaissance MUSIC BEGINS as we--

CUT TO:

A PIECE OF PAPER

as a printer presses down the press onto it. The title

page is printed in front of us. It's called "Venus and

Adonis". A MONTAGE BEGINS.

And the printer brings the page out from the press and

checks it for proper alignment.

SHAKESPEARE (V.O.)

`The boar!' quoth she; whereat a

sudden pale,

Like lawn being spread upon the

blushing rose...

Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his

tale,

(MORE)

104

pg. 105

SHAKESPEARE (V.O.)

And on his neck her yoking arms she

throws:

The printer nods his approval...   The poem continues

with:

Shakespeare exits the Print Shop, continuing to read

the book, now out-loud.

SHAKESPEARE (V.O.)

She sinketh down, still hanging by his

neck,

He on her belly falls, she on her

back.

(not quoting)

Oh, I like this...

DISSOLVE TO:

A COVER OF "VENUS AND ADONIS"

that is held by a woman.

LADY IN WAITING (O.S.)

'Fondling,' she saith,

I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my

deer;

Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or

in dale:

We are:

A LADY-IN-WAITING is reading out loud to other Ladies.

They listen giggling now and then. We only see them

from the back.

LADY IN WAITING

Graze on my lips; and if those hills

be dry,

Stray lower, where the pleasant

fountains lie.

105

pg. 106

SECOND LADY IN WAITING

(continuing)

Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty

breedeth beauty;

Thou wast begot; to beget is thy duty.

By law of nature thou art bound to

breed...

They look up and see--

ELIZABETH

standing across the room.   How much has she heard?

WIDER

They all stand abruptly, worried. The women who was

reading the book puts it down on a table.

Elizabeth silently walks over to them, and picks up the

book. She opens it as we--

CUT TO:

Robert Cecil walks down the long hall, heading for an

audience with the queen. Two guards open a door,

letting him into--

Elizabeth is looking out the window. It's raining

outside. She is NOT wearing her wig, not much make-up,

and looks quite... odd.

Robert Cecil enters.

ELIZABETH

(turns)

You find me disgusting, don't you?

Repugnant. Wrinkled?

ROBERT CECIL

You, you are the sun, majesty.   The

glory of--

ELIZABETH

Liar!

Robert Cecil shuts his mouth.

106

pg. 107

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

Is it so hard to believe that once I

was young? That I was... beautiful?

Your father knew me as such...

(beat)

You have read the book?

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

He writes to me. To remind me of that

beauty. That love. How I... took

him. How I... adored him...

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

(throaty, sexually)

Graze on my lips; and if those hills

be dry,

Stray lower, where the pleasant

fountains lie...

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

I've been foolish. Proud. Yes. Too

proud. Gloriana... The Virgin

Queen... A statue. Bloodless.

(beat)

"Thou wast begot; to beget is thy

duty.

By law of nature thou art bound to

breed, That thine may live when thou

thyself art dead"...

(beat)

Your father told you of the child?

ROBERT CECIL

(hint of a smile)

Which one, your majesty?

ELIZABETH

His.   Mine.   He still lives?

107

pg. 108

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

He was well placed? A nobleman?

ROBERT CECIL

(hesitates)

Yes... your majesty.

ELIZABETH

Who?

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

I am your Queen! Now who is my son!!?

ROBERT CECIL

His grace, the Earl of... Southampton,

your majesty.

CECIL

Majesty... You are not having doubts

about James of Scotland succeeding

you, are you?

ELIZABETH

James?! He is the son of Mary! She

plotted and schemed to steal the

throne from under me! No son of hers

will rule while a yet Tudor lives!

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

I will decide what is best for my

kingdom! Not you! Not you!!

(calmer)

I have bid Edward to come to me on my

return to London on Monday next. It

is decided.

108

pg. 109

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

(sotto)

And so, in spite of death, I shall

survive,

In that, my likeness still is left

alive.

CUT TO:

Ben Jonson walks with a manuscript in his hands. He

stops for a moment when he sees the new Globe theater.

Workers are still painting the walls.

He pauses when he sees a poster in front advertising a

performance of "Richard III" on Monday next.

Jonson sticks his head in and takes in the glorious new

theater Shakespeare and Burbage have built.

The actor Condell is on stage, rehearsing the character

of "Gloucester". He walks on stage with a limp, and

has a large hump on his back. He is a caricature of

Robert Cecil.

"GLOUCESTER"

(in character)

But I, that am not shaped for sportive

tricks, nor made to court an amorous

looking-glass...

Richard BURBAGE, the theater's stage manager, is

watching his performance with Spencer and a group of

actors.

Jonson stops and watches the rehearsal for a beat.

"GLOUCESTER" (CONT'D)

(in character)

I, that am curtail'd of this fair

proportion, deformed, unfinish'd, sent

before my time into this breathing

world...

SPENCER

Good part, that...

109

pg. 110

"GLOUCESTER"

...and that so lamely and

unfashionable that dogs bark at me as

I halt by them.

(out of character)

Is this wise?

BURBAGE

It's only the one performance.   Go on!

"GLOUCESTER"

I need a drink...

JONSON

(to Burbage)

Burbage. Wonderful theater. Wonderful!

The best Bankside! But only one

performance? Is it that bad?

BURBAGE

Hardly, it's Will's new play. Richard

the Third. We've been hired to

perform it free to the public.

JONSON

Free?

BURBAGE

Aye. Some anonymous nobleman paid for

everything. God knows Will never

would.   Been rehearsing all week,

just found out this morning, we go up

next Monday.

JONSON

(grins)

My best so far. I guarantee more than

one performance. Though I'll not pay

for the tickets myself.

(winks)

No need to.

BURBAGE

Sorry, Ben...

110

pg. 111

BURBAGE (CONT'D)

Will... He's part owner... I'm sorry

Ben, but I had to agree no Jonson

plays at the Globe... Ever.

Jonson is in shock.

CUT TO:

Jonson is deep in drink, by himself.   He listens as

patrons of the bar say:

MAN

(to a woman)

You doin' tomorrow?

WOMAN

You askin?

MAN

Managed to get two tickets to

Shakespeare's latest. Cost me a

fortune.

PASSING MAN

Ballocks, did it! They're giving them

away free.

Some of the actors from the rehearsal enter, all jolly

and excited. They head for the bar. They are: The

ACTOR WHO PLAYED "GLOUCESTER", Spencer, Pope, Heminge,

etc...

SPENCER

Best villain in the history of

theater, Richard the Third. No doubt.

HEMINGE

Come on.    Better than Mephistopheles?

SPENCER

No doubt! Your Marlowe-- god rest his

soul-- is fine for your everyday

scalawag, and your Jonson won't even

try the hard drama. No, this is

Shakespeare, for god's sake! The man

knows drama. I tell you, not even the

Greeks compare!

(toasting)

To Shakespeare! And villainy!

111

pg. 112

ALL

To Shakespeare! And villainy!

Jonson gets up, furious, and exits, quite drunk.     The

actors don't even notice him.

Jonson stumbles down the streets, alone, deep in his

own private hell. It's raining.

WHORE

Fancy a tumble? Only sixpence!

Jonson waves her off.     He looks up and sees:

FROM HIS POV:

The Tower of London. He makes a decision.

Jonson sits in the same spot where Marlowe was sitting

earlier. And he hates himself for it. Rain drips down

the windows.

Pole looks up from some papers.

POLE

I haven't got all day, man.

JONSON

I... There is a-- there is a play to

be performed... on Monday.

POLE

There's many plays to be performed

next Monday, isn't there?

JONSON

Yes, my lord, but this one is to be

performed one performance, and one

performance only. On Monday. All

Bankside is talking of it.

(beat)

The History of King Richard the Third.

By William Shakespeare.

Pole is confused.   So?

112

pg. 113

JONSON (CONT'D)

He kills his brother the king, and

half the royal family to get the

throne for himself--

POLE

I know who Richard the Third was.

JONSON

Yes. Of course you do. But in

William Shakespeare's version, he is

played as a hunch-back.

Pole realizes this is significant.

Robert Cecil has prayed all night. His lips silently

move in a prayer for a miracle.

When Pole appears he doesn't stop his prayer. Only

after Pole whispers in his ear does he stop and look

slowly up to the simple cross and close his eyes in

relief.

From high, high above a city of 200,000 souls. It's a

beautiful sunny day, but black storm clouds are on the

horizon.

All of London is on its feet. They all are on their way

to Bankside.

The London Bridge is crammed one way. The River Thames

is full of many small boats of theatergoers.

We see that a huge crowd has formed in front of the

Globe.

Everyone is busy, preparing for the performance;

actors, stage-hands, etc...

Shakespeare adjusts an actor's costume when Burbage

walks up besides him.

113

pg. 114

BURBAGE

We have to turn `em away by the

hundreds! Look! Never seen anything

quite like it!

And both men look out the curtains to the crowd

outside.

The theater is full to the last seat. The people are

crammed together like sardines.

Oxford is being dressed in front of a mirror...    His

finest clothes... Powder to face...

Francesco assists him.

Jonson is leaning against the edge of the balustrade,

watching the Groundlings fill in. He bites his nails

nervous.

Nashe joins him as--

NASHE

So! I heard the Earl of Essex paid for

this whole performance! Man's never even

been to the theater, and still he's heard

of Will--

Dekker also joins them.

DEKKER

Essex!? Impossible. My cousin's one of

his men-at-arms. Hasn't been paid in

weeks. They're all just sitting there,

waiting.

JONSON

Waiting?     Waiting for what?

DEKKER

Wants to have an audience with the Queen.

As if Cecil would ever let Essex near her

now.

NASHE

By the mass, Cecil in favor, Essex out!

Who can keep up with it all!?

(takes a swig)

(MORE)

114

pg. 115

NASHE (CONT'D)

Zounds, I tire of politics, politics,

politics.

Oxford is in a long-boat, headed for Whitehall Palace.

The oars of the boat cut neatly and silently into the

water.

Elizabeth is doing her toilette. She seems excited like

a school girl before her first date. Her Ladies in

waiting are attending to her.

The audience HUSHES as--

ON STAGE

"GLOUCESTER", the future Richard III, enters. He is

hunch-backed, and looks as much like Robert Cecil as

possible in terms of beard and costume. First the

people are in stunned silence, but then like magic the

hissing starts. It is followed by more hissing and the

first boos.

The actor playing Gloucester nervously looks around...

IN THE GALLERIES

Dekker seems surprised at the similarity to Robert Cecil.

DEKKER

(to Nashe)

Tired of politics are you? Seems you

picked the wrong day to come to the

theater, then...

Jonson gives Dekker a sharp look.   What's going on here?

ON STAGE

"Gloucester" addresses the audience.

"GLOUCESTER"

Now is the winter of our discontent

made glorious summer by this son of

York. Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd

his wrinkled front....

115

pg. 116

The hissing and booing has swelled so strong that the

actor stops for a moment. But then he finds the courage

again to continue.

Jonson looks down at the Groundling's reaction, and

spots--

FRANCESCO

in the audience. But among the Groundlings, not in

Oxford's usual box seat.

JONSON

looks over to Oxford's box.   It's empty.

"GLOUCESTER"

...and now instead of mounting barded

steeds to fright the souls of fearful

adversaries, he capers nimbly in a

lady's chamber to the lascivious

pleasing of a lute. But I, that am

not shaped for sportive tricks, nor

made to court an amorous looking-

glass...

Robert Cecil watches himself in a mirror as armor is

placed on him by servants.

"GLOUCESTER" (O.S.)

I, that am curtail'd of this fair

proportion, deformed, unfinish'd, sent

before my time into this breathing

world,....

The huge crowd has stayed in front of the Globe. It

seems they are waiting for something. We hear hissing

and booing from the crowd inside the theater.

"GLOUCESTER"

...and that so lamely and

unfashionable that dogs bark at me as

I halt by them.

116

pg. 117

On stage, "Gloucester: continues despite the concert of

hissing and booing...

"GLOUCESTER"

And therefore, since I cannot prove a

lover, I am determined to prove a

villain and hate the idle pleasures of

these days...

Essex mounts his horse, Southampton at his side. Their

sixty or so men behind them ready for the march to

Elizabeth.

ESSEX

Edward knows what he is doing...      Does

he not?

SOUTHAMPTON

He promised us a mob. They'll be

here.

Essex looks concerned, but says no more.

The servant tightens the last strap of Robert Cecil's

armor. He smiles at himself in the mirror.

"GLOUCESTER" (O.S.)

Plots have I laid!

CANNONS DRAWN BY HORSES

as they roll down a cobbled street.   We are:

Soldiers move people and carts off the street. Others

put CANNONS into place and then cover them with canvas

tarps.

"GLOUCESTER" (O.S.)

Inductions dangerous, by drunken

prophecies, libels and dreams, to set

my brother Clarence and the king in

deadly hate the one against the other.

117

pg. 118

Shakespeare watches from backstage, getting more and

more nervous by the audience's reaction.

AN AUDIENCE MEMBER

(to the actor playing

"Gloucester")

A pox on you!

FRANCESCO

A pox on Cecil!

MORE AUDIENCE MEMBERS

A pox on Cecil! A pox on Cecil!

The actors are getting nervous.      People start throwing

lettuce and tomatoes at them.

NASHE

Why is Oxford's man with the Groundlings?

BACKSTAGE

Shakespeare and Burbage exchange a worried glance.

The BELLS of St. James' Cathedral mark the hour as five

o'clock. Essex looks to Southampton nervously.

The play continues. "Gloucester" is plotting yet

another death on his way to the throne.

"GLOUCESTER"

Hath she forgot already that brave

prince,

Edward, her lord, whom I, some three

months since,

Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?

A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-

Fram'd in the prodigality of

nature,     Young, valiant, wise, and

no doubt right royal-

FRANCESCO

Down with Cecil!

The actor playing "Gloucester" hesitates.     The audience

is getting unruly.

118

pg. 119

FRANCESCO (CONT'D)

Up with Essex! To Essex House!     To

Essex House!!

JONSON

This is what Essex is waiting for--

(realizing)

Oxford is bringing him a mob.

NASHE

Why would Oxford--

JONSON

I don't know, I don't know! But, the

Tower-- Cecil, he already knows. He

knows!

(looks at Francesco)

I-- I have to warn them!

VARIOUS GROUNDLINGS

Up with Essex! Essex! Death to

Cecil!

SHAKESPEARE

We must close the play. Now!!

BURBAGE

Close the...? Are you off your head?

"GLOUCESTER"

(repeating)

Fram'd... in the prodigality of

nature, Young, valiant, wise, and no

doubt right royal-

119

pg. 120

"Ess-ex, Ess-ex, Ess-ex"

ON THE GROUND

Jonson pushes his way through the crowd, trying to head

for Francesco. But they're separated by a sea of people.

FRANCESCO

To Essex House! To Essex House!

Death to Cecil! Traitor!

A moment as the whole audience thinks on this. And

then these chants are repeated by hundreds in the

audience as they are pushing towards exits.

And Jonson-- still struggling to reach Francesco-- is

carried along with the mob.

The mob pours out of the doors.

Storm clouds are gathering.   A RUMBLE of thunder sounds

in the distance.

Oxford is waiting for his audience, looking out a

window, nervously.

The crowd pours through Bankside, growing in numbers as

more people come out of taverns, whore-houses, etc...

A shop-owner comes out of his store, confused.   Another

MAN grabs him.

MAN

To Essex!   And then to the Queen!

(joins in the chanting)

Ess-ex! Ess-ex!

The shop-owner begins to get the spirit of the mob.

If anything, the crowd is twice the size it was moments

ago. They head down the shop-lined bridge, full of

bravado.

120

pg. 121

JONSON

is in the middle of the uncontrolled mob.   He spots

Francesco nearby.

WIDER

The mob has to slow down on the bridge. There is not

much room. And then it happens!

We are at the front of the mob, when the first soldiers

appear and pull down the tarps revealing the cannons.

People scream as an Officer appears and--

OFFICER

Fire!

And then the cannon FIRES. There is PANIC all around,

and-

JONSON

runs with the crowd, trying to escape.

Essex and Southampton look tense.   They expected a mob

here by now.

SOUTHAMPTON

They should be here by now...

Essex frowns.

ESSEX

We go as we are! Now!!

And he spurs his horse, and GALLOPS down the street.

ESSEX (CONT'D)

To the Queen!

Southampton has no choice, and follows.   So do the 60

or so men behind them.

Oxford hears a cannon shot. But it could also be the

sound of thunder. He goes to the window, sees the rain

clouds, and dismisses the sound. A LADY IN WAITING

enters.

121

pg. 122

LADY-IN-WAITING

My lord.    Her majesty will be with you

shortly.

The mob is in panic.      And--

JONSON

is in the middle of it.

FRANCESCO

Signor Jonson! We are betrayed!    Run!

Run!

Jonson looks on in horror as Francesco is KILLED by a

soldier wielding a pike.

Essex and his men ROAR past the token guards at the

front gate, and gallop into the--

MAIN COURTYARD

Essex rears his horse, looks around at the many windows

that surround them from above.

ESSEX

To the Queen! To the Queen!

His men repeat his plea.      And then, once again, another

trap springs.

THE GATE

SLAMS closed.    And--

GUARDS ARMED WITH MUSKETS

line up in a colonnade in the story above.      Pole is in

command.

POLE

Take your aim!

SOUTHAMPTON

realizes--

122

pg. 123

SOUTHAMPTON

It's a trap!

ESSEX

Spread out!

But before his men can obey--

IN THE COLONNADE

Pole orders--

POLE

Fire!!

IN THE COURTYARD

AND a hundred shots FIRE down into Essex and his men!

Oxford HEARS the SHOTS fired.    Confused, he goes to a

window, looks out and sees:

FROM HIS POV:

Men fall all around Essex and Southampton.

Pole walks down the colonnade.

POLE

Re-load!

Elizabeth heads for the window just as a door behind

her SLAMS open, and Robert Cecil hurries in with a

dozen guards.

ROBERT CECIL

Majesty! You must away! Essex is in

armed revolt! He's come to usurp you!

ELIZABETH

(confused)

Essex? I-- Edward is--

She seems like a confused old woman.

123

pg. 124

ROBERT CECIL

You must flee! Quickly! Majesty! He

means to kill you and take your throne

for himself!

It takes only an instant for that to sink in. She

looks enraged. And then she turns with a flurry, and

heads back the way she came. The guards that were with

Robert Cecil follow her.

Another fusillade is SHOT, and more of Essex's men go

down.

And then doors OPEN on the ground floor, and guards

RUSH out to take down the survivors.

Essex and Southampton valiantly fight, but there's just

too many.

They're soon surrounded... And Essex, knowing all is

lost, raises his sword in defeat.

Southampton sees this, and does the same.

Oxford watches all of this through the window.

ROBERT CECIL (O.S.)

She won't forgive him this, Edward.

Oxford turns, devastated.

ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)

Essex will be convicted and executed

for treason.

(beat)

As will your son.

Oxford looks shocked.

ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)

(smiles)

What? Didn't you think I knew? Of

course I knew, Edward. My father told

me all his secrets. All of them.

(smiling)

Though the most fascinating was not

made known to me until after his

death.

(MORE)

124

pg. 125

ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)

He hated you, Edward, how he hated

you. And yet he married his only

daughter to you. I never knew why,

until I read his last letter to me.

OXFORD

He wanted his grandson to be an Earl.

ROBERT CECIL

No, Edward.   He wanted his grandson to

be a king.

ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)

Elizabeth had several children,

Edward, not just yours. She was

sixteen for the first. Bloody Mary

was still Queen, and our future

Gloriana was out of favor. No one

thought her very important at all.

Except my father, of course. And when

her first child was born, a male, my

father took it, and hid it. The

grandson of Henry VIII, the foundling

of course had to be reared a nobleman.

John De Vere, the previous Earl of

Oxford, agreed to accept the task.

OXFORD

You lie...

ROBERT CECIL

Do I?

(beat)

Why do you think he worked so hard to

become your guardian after your father

died? He had it all planned years in

advance. He would teach you

everything he knew about statecraft,

marry his daughter, and, after

Elizabeth's death, proclaim you heir.

His own grandchild to follow you on

the throne. But he couldn't possibly

predict what kind of failure you would

become. How you would fail in

politics, ignore your estates to the

point of bankruptcy, all to write...

(sneers)

Poetry.

(beat)

Or that you would commit incest.

(MORE)

125

pg. 126

ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)

(beat)

Delicious isn't it? Right out of a

Greek tragedy.

OXFORD

Elizabeth would never have--

ROBERT CECIL

What?  Slept with her son?

(beat)

I don't think she ever knew, to tell

you the truth. Though you never know

with the Tudors. They all have had

such strange tastes in bed-fellows.

(beat)

You could have been a king, Edward.

And your son after you. Except for

the fact that... you were you.

It's raining, hard.

Oxford almost stumbles out of the building onto the now

empty courtyard. The remains of the battle are still

visible. Wounded, screaming horses struggle to

stand...

Oxford's a shell-- devoid of emotion. Broken. Hardly

alive at all. He drops to his knees, the rain pouring

down on him.

We see the silhouette of a man watching through a

window from the second story above. It's--

--Robert Cecil, a slight smile on his face.

Pole approaches him from behind. Robert Cecil doesn't

turn or acknowledge Pole, but speaks to him as he

stares at Oxford.

ROBERT CECIL

I want a fair trial for Southampton...

Evidence, witnesses, no false

confessions. It must be above

reproach. Though with a guilty

verdict of course. Oh, and Pole--

(turns)

If there is any mention of that play--

(looks back at Oxford)

(MORE)

126

pg. 127

ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)

--Make certain the secretaries refer

to it as Richard the Second. There

will be no mention of hunchbacks in

the official record...

CUT TO:

Oxford is sitting in a chair, watching the river

Thames, alone. Snow is falling and Oxford is covered

in a thick blanket. He looks ill.

Anne walks up behind him.

ANNE

Sentence has been passed.

Oxford looks over at her.   Anne smiles.   This news

gives her great pleasure.

ANNE (CONT'D)

They are to be be-headed.

(with venom)

Both of them. Essex tomorrow,

Southampton in a week.

(beat)

Your son is going to be killed,

Edward. By his own mother. Put that

in one of your plays!

And she leaves him with that.

Essex-- dressed in black, but with a bright red

waistcoat-- is led up a scaffold by guards, his hands

bound behind him.

Snow covers the courtyard. There are only a few

witnesses, as befitting Essex's rank.

ESSEX

stands, looking at life one last time. The Executioner

approaches with an axe. Essex turns, realizing it is

time.

ESSEX

Strike true.

He kneels, resting his head on a wooden bench.

127

pg. 128

ESSEX (CONT'D)

God save the Queen!

And BAM!   Just as the axe lands we--

CUT TO:

FROM A WINDOW

we see the body of Essex fall onto the scaffolding, his

head into a basket. We are:

Southampton, a prisoner, is watching his future fate

from a room high in a tower.

DISSOLVE TO:

BOOTS

as they walk, limping along tiled floors.      We are:

Doors fly open and Oxford appears before Elizabeth, who

is on her throne, regal and all in white, surrounded

by courtiers, including Robert Cecil. But she looks

very old, very ill.

Everyone goes silent as Oxford approaches Elizabeth.

Oxford makes no notice of them. He bows deeply in

front of her.

ELIZABETH

Leave us.    All of you.

People start to exit.     But not Robert Cecil.

ROBERT CECIL

Majesty, I--

ELIZABETH

Leave us!

Cecil exits, obviously worried.       When they are alone:

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

You look old...

Oxford smiles sadly.

128

pg. 129

OXFORD

I thank your majesty for seeing me.

ELIZABETH

You cannot have him.

OXFORD

He is our son.

ELIZABETH

Who did commit High Treason!

OXFORD

They only wished for a place in

government equal to their station.

Equal to their birth.

ELIZABETH

You caused this! Your play, your

words, caused my people to mob against

me! Do you think I wasn't aware of

your plot with this man Shakespeare,

that I wouldn't recognize your voice?

It should be your head on the block

next week, not Southampton's!

OXFORD

Then take my head. In our son's

stead.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

Neither they nor I ever conspired

against you. Cecil alone was our aim.

He has corrupted your--

ELIZABETH

Cecil?  He has kept me my throne!

(beat)

Mary, Queen of Scots... Philip, King

of Spain... Four French Louis's...

Eight Popes-- they all wanted my head.

My throne. All of them!

(beat)

Yet here I remain... Because of the

Cecils.

OXFORD

We would have protected you--

129

pg. 130

ELIZABETH

You would have protected me? You? My

"loyal" Earls?

(snarls)

You think Essex and Southampton were

the first to conspire against me, to

try to take my throne? No!

(beat)

Only the Cecils could I trust!

Commoners! They could never claim my

throne. Never! Their wealth, their

power, their survival, all depended on

me. Me and no other!

OXFORD

Let our child live...

ELIZABETH

(furious)

All Englishmen are my children!

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

Does he know?

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

And if I give him to you?

OXFORD

He will never learn of it from me.

ELIZABETH

He must never know... Never.

(beat)

Take him.

OXFORD

But only after my death! Only then!

When all is complete. After James is

crowned king, his crown safe, only

then can you claim your son... our

son.

(beat)

This Island will be whole.

(MORE)

130

pg. 131

OXFORD (CONT'D)

One Island, one kingdom, one King.

(with disgust)

Scotsman though he be.

(beat)

That, that will be my final gift to my

people.

(beat)

And I shall remain pure... Un-taken!

Elizabeth again looks out a window.

ELIZABETH

Treason... that is all that has come

from you... your son... Your plays...

None will be claimed by you. None.

And she leaves the throne chamber. Oxford looks after

her as the SOUNDS of BELLS slowly begin GONGING as we-

DISSOLVE TO:

The bell-ringing comes from St. Paul's Cathedral, the

largest church in the City.

CUT TO:

On the frozen river Thames we see the funeral

procession for the greatest Queen England has ever

seen. Everybody follows the carriage with the casket

of the queen.

All the lords and ladies of the land.   All wear

elaborate black clothing.

First is Robert Cecil.   Proudly.   Not far walks Oxford.

He is a statue. Devoid of emotion. And then joyous

CHORAL MUSIC replaces the CHURCH GONGS as we--

CUT TO:

A GOLD CROWN

as it is placed on a head.    We are:

131

pg. 132

JAMES I (late 30's) is being crowned by the Archbishop.

All the lords and ladies of the land are standing in

attendance.

ROBERT CECIL

is watching James. His face betrays his proud

feelings. All of Robert Cecil's desires have come true.

Oxford's wife Anne is there, but Oxford is nowhere to

be seen.

ARCHBISHOP (O.S.)

God save the King!

EVERYONE IN THE ABBEY

God save the King!

CUT TO:

It's foggy. Oxford stands next to a carriage, waiting

as the gates open, and Southampton-- scruffy and a bit

worse for wear-- is escorted out.

Southampton smiles weakly when he sees Oxford waiting

for him. The two men walk towards each other and

embrace.

Both men have tears in their eyes.

SHAKESPEARE (O.S.)

No, no, no, no.

CUT TO:

Shakespeare is on stage, supervising a rehearsal of

"Much Ado About Nothing". He doesn't look pleased.

SHAKESPEARE

The line won't get a laugh that way.

You must accent the word sirrah--

JONSON (O.S.)

Will!   Will Shakespeare!

132

pg. 133

Shakespeare turns and sees Jonson heading his way.

Jonson is completely drunk, waving a sword in one hand,

a tankard in another.

JONSON (CONT'D)

So!    Off to the palace are you?

Shakespeare immediately sees Jonson's condition.

SHAKESPEARE

Ben!

JONSON

A command performance for our new

king! Even in bloody Scotland they've

heard of bloody Will Shakespeare, have

they? Fraud. Charlatan.

Counterfeiter of wit! Murderer!

The actors on stage are all watching, nervous.

SHAKESPEARE

Ben, please...

But Jonson CHARGES Shakespeare. Shakespeare easily

dodges the drunk Jonson. Jonson ROARS and attacks

again.

Shakespeare dodges again, turns, and manages to grab

Jonson by the throat. They are face to face.

SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)

You came to me, Ben. You came to me!

They stare at each other and then Shakespeare SHOVES

him off. Jonson falls to the ground.

CUT TO:

Jonson-- only semi conscious-- is carried by the actors

and dumped into the street. They leave him there. He

wallows in the mud for a beat. Then--

SERVANT (O.C.)

Master Jonson?

Jonson looks up to see one of Oxford's servants

standing above him.

133

pg. 134

The servant guides Jonson towards Oxford's bedroom just

as Anne and a DOCTOR emerge from it. She recognizes

him.

ANNE

(to servant)

What is this man doing in my house?

The servant doesn't know what to say.

ANNE (CONT'D)

(to Jonson)

You will leave at once. My husband is

quite ill--

JONSON

It was your husband who sent for me,

madam.

ANNE

And I am dismissing you--

A SECOND DOCTOR exits the sick man's room.

SECOND DOCTOR

Are you Jonson?

Jonson nods.

SECOND DOCTOR (CONT'D)

He's asking for you.

JONSON

Excuse me, your grace.

CUT TO:

Oxford, in bed, looks quite ill, sweat covering his

brow.

He furiously writes on a small tablet on his lap. He

holds up his hand for silence as Jonson enters, the

doctor following behind him.

OXFORD

Thank you, doctor.

The doctor exits.

134

pg. 135

OXFORD (CONT'D)

Come over here, Jonson...

OXFORD (CONT'D)

Did you know, Jonson, that my family

can trace its peerage farther back

than any family in the kingdom?   We

fought at Crecy. At Bosworth Field.

At Agincourt.

(beat)

I inherited my Earldom as one of the

wealthiest men ever to breathe English

air... and at last breath, I shall be

one of the poorest.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

Never a voice in government. Never a

sword raised in glorious battle. No

immortal deeds for my heirs to know me

by.

(beat)

Words, merely words, are to be my

legacy...

(beat)

You alone watch my plays and know them

as mine. When I hear the applause,

the cheering, of the audience, all

those hands clapping, they are

celebrating... another man. But in

that cacophony of sounds, I strained

to hear the sound of two hands only.

Yours.

(beat)

But heard them, I never did.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

Death takes away all pretense and

demands honesty from its target. You,

you have never told me... never told

me what you thought of my work...

135

pg. 136

JONSON

(almost a whisper)

I find... your words... the most

wondrous ever heard on our stage.    On

any stage... Ever.

JONSON (CONT'D)

(sotto)

You are the soul of the age...

OXFORD

Promise me... promise me, Jonson, that

you will keep our secret safe. That

you won't expose Shakespeare...

JONSON

My lord?

OXFORD

I have seen it in your face... He

vexes you. How could he not? But he

is not your burden. He is mine.

OXFORD (CONT'D)

All my writings. The plays, the

sonnets... Keep them safe. Keep them

from my family. From the Cecil's.

Wait a few years, and then, publish

them.

JONSON

I am not worthy of this charge, my

lord. I... I betrayed you... I told

them of your--

OXFORD

I have made it my life to know the

character of men, Jonson. I know you.

You may have betrayed me, but you will

never betray my words...

FRONT PAGE

Which reads "DEDICATION", then more words, starting

with:

"To the Earl of Southampton"

Jonson leaves Oxford's room, visibly shaken.    The

manuscripts are under his arm.

Anne, Oxford's wife is still there, surround by

doctors.

Then she sees Jonson leaving.

ANNE

Get out! You, your friends, your

blasphemous theaters, have brought

nothing but ruin and dishonor to this

family.

JONSON

Ruin? Dishonor? Madam. You, your

family, me, even Elizabeth herself

shall be remembered solely because we

had the honor to live whilst your

husband put ink to paper.

He turns and exits.

CUT TO:

Jonson exits the building and walks away. He reads the

dedication on the first page of the manuscript as he

walks.

JONSON (V.O.)

To the Earl of Southampton. The love

I dedicate to your lordship is without

end; whereof this pamphlet, without

beginning, is but a superfluous

moiety.

Jonson freezes, and looks back at Oxford's house,

realizing there is another whole layer to all this;

exactly what he can only guess.

A few hours later. Oxford has died in his bed. Anne

watches as a doctor covers his face with a sheet.

JONSON (V.O.)

What I have done is yours; what I have

to do is yours; being part in all I

have, devoted, yours.

A casket is being interred into the family mausoleum.

Anne is there, as are Oxford's children. So is Robert

Cecil.

JONSON (V.O.)

Were my worth greater, my duty would

show greater; meantime, as it is, it

is bound to your lordship, to whom I

wish long life... still lengthened

with all happiness.

Southampton is there as well.   Watching. Tears roll

down his cheeks.

CUT TO:

Where we began.

A bucket of water is DUMPED on Jonson. He regains

consciousness and looks around. Somewhat confused he

sees:

Robert Cecil limping out of the dark towards him.

Robert Cecil leans down, and very close to his ear,

whispers:

CECIL

I can make all this go away, Jonson...

To be but a dream. Like one of your

plays... Or, I can bring you so much

pain-- pain that were you given a

thousand years, and a thousand quills,

you could never justly describe...

Cecil steps back.

pg. 139

CECIL (CONT'D)

I know you have them. All his

manuscripts. My sister saw you leave

Oxford Stone with them under your arm.

JONSON

They were destroyed...   burned...   by

your own men...

INTERROGATOR

He's lying...

JONSON

My lord? Why would I lie? Is there a

man alive who has reason to hate him

more than I?

JONSON (CONT'D)

He was something I could never be. An

undeniable perfection... that plagued

my soul... And to him I was...

nothing. A messenger. Nothing more.

CECIL

Let him go!   He tells the truth.

CECIL (CONT'D)

And Jonson-- better him, won't you?

Wipe his memory for all time. For

you. And for me.

JONSON

(sotto)

I am afraid that this is not possible,

my lord.

Jonson is getting released. He walks away....a lonely

figure.

Wide from above...Still smoking from the fire....All

the sudden we make out Jonson searching through the

rubble.

Set for a Court performance of a play. Courtiers bow

as King James I enters the chamber, Robert Cecil two

steps behind him. James takes his seat right in front

of the stage, as Elizabeth used to.

Jonson's eyes search the ground.   And, eventually, he

finds it--

THE METAL BOX

that seems to somehow have survived the conflagration.

JONSON

opens the box.

INSIDE THE BOX

Are the manuscripts Oxford gave him. Jonson smiles,

relieved. They are singed at the edges, but they are

there. We hear--

PROLOGUE (O.S.)

O-- for a muse of fire... that would

ascend the brightest heaven of

invention...

DISSOLVE TO:

AN ACTOR

playing Prologue. He is the same actor who introduced

the "play" at the beginning of the film. But now he

wears Elizabethan clothing-- but again, all

monochromatic and grey.

140

pg. 141

PROLOGUE (CONT'D)

A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,

and monarchs to behold the swelling

scene!

And he is standing on the stage.

PROLOGUE

Let us, ciphers to this great accompt,

on your imaginary forces work.

King James' watches enthusiastically, Robert Cecil

right next to him.

JAMES I

We had seen some of this Shakespeare's

plays in Edinburgh, Sir Robert. I

must tell you, we enjoyed them

immensely, and look forward to seeing

many more, now that we are in

London... I presume you are as avid a

theater man as myself?

Robert Cecil's smile remains frozen.

ROBERT CECIL

Of course, your majesty...

The CAMERA moves away from them and we realize we are

on the theater stage where we started.

"Prologue" turns and addresses his audience (and us) in

the modern theater.

PROLOGUE

Robert Cecil remained the most powerful

man in the Court of King James, though he

could not prevent the public theaters

from becoming ever more popular. William

Shakespeare, however, spent the remaining

years of his life not in the playhouses

of London, but in the small town of his

birth, Stratford upon Avon, as a

businessman and grain merchant.

PROLOGUE (CONT'D)

Ben Jonson succeeded in his desire to be

the most celebrated playwright of his

time, becoming England's first Poet

Laureate. And in 1623, he wrote the

dedication to the collected works of the

man we call William Shakespeare.

(beat)

And so... though our story is finished,

our poet's is not. For his monument is

ever-living, made not of stone but of

verse, and it shall be remembered... as

long as words are made of breath and

breath of life.

FADE OUT.
