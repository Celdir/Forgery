MATCH CUT TO:

HELEN (O.S.)

Mark, get off your father!

KENNY

Hi, hon.

HELEN

Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk

to you this afternoon about Kevin.  You

need to do something about this.

KENNY

Kids are supposed to get detention.

SMASH CUT TO:

SMASH CUT TO:

KENNY

Secretary of Defense...

KEVIN

Dean Rusk!

KENNY

Wrong, and you get to wax my car.

KENNY JR.

Rusk is State, moron.  Robert McNamara.

HELEN

Got time for pancakes?

KENNY

Nope.  Attorney General?

KIDS

(chorus)

Too easy!  Bobby, Bobby Kennedy!

KENNY

All right, wise guys, Assistant

Secretary of State for Latin America...

SMASH CUT TO:

SMASH CUT TO:

SMASH CUT TO:

SMASH CUT TO:

KENNY

Morning, Floyd.

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

Good morning, Mr. O'Donnell.

KENNY

Top o' the morning, Mr. President.

THE PRESIDENT

Morning, Kenny.  You see this goddamn

Capehart stuff?

KENNY

Bayh's going to lose, but it's good

groundwork for us for '64.

THE PRESIDENT

I was eating that.

KENNY

No you weren't.

THE PRESIDENT

(scanning the paper)

I was, you bastard.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

So what've we got today?

KENNY

Today, for your information, is Pulaski

Day.  We're going to Buffalo...

SMASH CUT TO:

POL #1

We're putting up Potowski next time.

Will you guys come out for him?

KENNY

Who else you got?

POL #2

There's Richardson.  Good kid.

KENNY

Got the touch?

POL #2

Yeah.  Still moldable, too.

KENNY

Everyone likes a good kid...

CROWD

MR. PRESIDENT!  PRESIDENT KENNEDY!

RESTON

How's my favorite President?

KENNY

Busy.  But you've got his heart.

RESTON

I want an hour with him.

KENNY

I said his heart, not his attention.

RESTON

Three weeks before midterm elections?

You need me.

KENNY

Well.  There is a new civil rights

initiative he wants to talk about.

RESTON

I'm doing a piece on Skybolt.  I hear

Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.

KENNY

We're giving the Brits Polaris instead.

But a story'll just aggravate things.

KENNY (CONT'D)

Not today.  He's got tight schedule.

RESTON

Pretending there isn't a problem won't

fix it.  He can clear the air on Anglo

American relations.

KENNY

Forget it, Scotty.

RESTON

Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan

look good, I print it, the British

public likes it, Macmillan owes you.

KENNY

All right, you're in.  Half hour.

SMASH CUT TO:

KENNY

Hey, Mac.  You're up bright and early.

BUNDY

No, Ken.  I need to see him now...

KENNY

Morning, Floyd.

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

Good morning, Mr. O'Donnell.  Mr. Bundy.

KENNY

What's it about?

BUNDY

Cuba.

KENNY

Just Cuba?  Okay, I got work to do, see

you guys downstairs.

KENNY

(to phone, scary calm)

Listen to me, you worthless piece of

disloyal shit.  You will pull Daly's man

on the circuit.  You owe your goddamn

job to this administration.

(beat, listening)

There is a word you need to learn.  It

is the only word in politics.  Loyalty.

LOYALTY you motherfucking piece of shit!

KENNY (CONT'D)

What're you looking at?  This isn't the

blessed order of St. Mary the Meek.

KENNY (CONT'D)

Excuse us.

THE PRESIDENT

I think you should come in here.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

Still think Cuba isn't important?

KENNY

Not as far as the election goes.

THE PRESIDENT

You used to look down a bomb sight for a

living, Ken.  What do you see?

KENNY

We hit a Nazi buzz bomb field in '45.

(beat, incredulous)

It looks like a rocket base...

BUNDY

On Sunday morning, one of our U-2s took

these pictures.  The Soviets are putting

medium range ballistic missiles into

Cuba.

LUNDAHL

They appear to be the SS-4: range of a

thousand miles, three-megaton nuclear

warhead.

KENNY

Jesus Christ in Heaven...

VARIOUS OPERATORS

Please hold for the White House...Mr.

O'Donnell for Secretary McNamara...

White House Operator... please hold...

KENNY

The principals are assembling in an

hour.  See you then.

THE PRESIDENT

Where's Bobby?

KENNY

Should be here any minute.

THE PRESIDENT

Good.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

Good.

BOBBY (O.S.)

Where the hell are you?

THE PRESIDENT

In here!

BOBBY

Jesus Christ, guys.  What the hell's

Khruschev thinking?

THE PRESIDENT

Did you have any indication of this from

Georgi?  Any possible warning or sense

of motivation?

BOBBY

(shaking his head)

Complete snowjob.  And then we went out

and told the country they weren't

putting missiles into Cuba.

(beat)

By the way, you realize we just lost the

midterms.

KENNY

Who gives a shit about the midterms now?

The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons

ninety miles away from us.

BOBBY

You mean there's something more

important than votes?  Didn't think I'd

live to see the day, Ken.

KENNY

Jesus.  I feel like we've caught the Jap

carriers steaming for Pearl Harbor.

GROUP

Good morning, Mr. President.

THE PRESIDENT

Good morning, gentlemen.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

Dean, good morning.

RUSK

Mr. President.

THE PRESIDENT

Bob.  Bet you had a late night.

MCNAMARA

Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.

KENNY

Lyndon.  Adlai.

THE PRESIDENT

Max.

GENERAL TAYLOR

McCone's been notified and is coming

back from the West coast.  Carter's

here, though.

KENNY

Ted.

SORENSEN

Kenny.

THE PRESIDENT

Okay.  Let's have it.

GENERAL CARTER

Arthur Lundahl heads our photographic

interpretation division at CIA.  I'll

let him and his boys take you through

what we've got.  Arthur?

LUNDAHL

Gentlemen, as most of you now know a U-2

over Cuba on Sunday morning took a

series of disturbing photographs.

LUNDAHL (V.O.)

Our analysis at NPIC indicates the

Soviet Union has followed its

conventional weapons build-up in Cuba

with the introduction of surface-to

surface medium-range ballistic missiles,

or MRBMs.  Our official estimate at this

time is that this missile system is the

SS-4 Sandal.  We do not believe these

missiles are as yet operational.

LUNDAHL

IRONBARK reports the SS-4 can deliver a

3-megaton nuclear weapon 1000 miles.  So

far we have identified 32 missiles

served by around 3400 men, undoubtedly

all Soviet personnel.  Our cities and

military installations in the Southeast,

as far north as Washington, are in range

of these weapons, and in the event of a

launch, would only have five minutes of

warning.

GENERAL CARTER

Five minutes, gentlemen.  Five minutes.

GENERAL TAYLOR

In those five minutes they could kill 80

million Americans and destroy a

significant number of our bomber bases,

degrading our retaliatory options.  The

Joint Chiefs' consensus is that this is

a massively destabilizing move,

upsetting the nuclear balance.

THE PRESIDENT

Arthur.  Are. You. Sure?

LUNDAHL

Yes, Mr. President.  These are nuclear

missiles.

BOBBY

How long until they're operational?

LUNDAHL

General Taylor can answer that question

better than I can.

GENERAL TAYLOR (V.O.)

GMAIC estimates ten to fourteen days.

However, a crash program to ready the

missiles could cut that time.

GENERAL TAYLOR

I have to stress that there may be more

missiles that we don't know about.  We

need more U-2 coverage.

THE PRESIDENT

Is there any indication - anything at

all - that suggests they intend to use

these missiles in some sort of first

strike?

GENERAL CARTER

Not at present, sir.  But I think the

prudent answer is we don't know.

THE PRESIDENT

Do we have any sort of intelligence from

CIA on what Khruschev is thinking?

GENERAL CARTER

No, Mr. President.  We don't.  We just

don't know what's happening inside the

Kremlin at that level.

BOBBY

They lied to us.  Two weeks ago Dobrynin

told me to my face Khurschev had no

intention of putting missiles into Cuba.

They said themselves, this is our

backyard.

THE PRESIDENT

Gentlemen, I want first reactions.

Assuming for a moment Khruschev has not

gone off the deep end and intends to

start World War Three, what are we

looking at?

RUSK

Mr. President, I believe my team is in

agreement.  If we permit the

introduction of nuclear missiles to a

Soviet satellite nation in our

hemisphere, the diplomatic consequences

will be too terrible to contemplate.

The Russians are trying to show the

world they can do whatever they want,

wherever they want, and we're powerless

to stop them.  If they succeed...

BOBBY

It will be Munich all over again.

RUSK

Appeasement only makes the aggressor

more aggressive.  Confidence in our

security commitments around the world

will falter, allies will become unsure

in the face of Soviet pressure, and the

Soviets will be emboldened to push us

even harder.  We must remove the

missiles one way or another.  It seems

to me the options are either to build up

the crisis 'til they give in, or we hit

them.  An air strike.

THE PRESIDENT

Bob?

MCNAMARA

We've worked up several military

scenarios.  Before I ask General Taylor

to lead us through the various options,

I'd like for us to adopt a rule.

If we are going to strike, we must agree

now that we will do it before the

missiles become operational.  Because

once they are, I don't think we can

guarantee getting them all before at

least some are launched.

BUNDY

Sir.  We need to consider... if we

decide to act, there's a good chance

we'll end up in a general war.

THE PRESIDENT

It's clear we cannot permit Soviet

nuclear missiles in Cuba.  We must get

those missiles out.

THE PRESIDENT

I don't think it's going to matter what

Khruschev's intentions are.  I tell you,

right now... I don't see any way around

hitting them.

KENNY

If we hit 'em, kill a lot of Russians,

they'll move against Berlin.  They

attack Berlin, that's NATO... and we're

at war.

BOBBY

Damned if we do, but if we don't, we're

in a war for sure somewhere else in six

months.

THE PRESIDENT

No choice.  This is going to cost lives

any way we go.  Do nothing, and it could

be 80 million  of ours.  We have to get

rid of those missiles.

KENNY

There've got to be alternatives to just

going out and bombing them.

BOBBY

He's right, Jack.  Taylor is saying we

may have some time.  We've got to use

it.

THE PRESIDENT

So if there are alternatives that make

sense - and I'm not saying there are -

we need 'em.  Need 'em fast.

BOBBY

What about the allies?  Congress?  I

think we may need to start letting key

people know.  And they're all scattered

across the country for the campaign.

We're going to need to get the U.N.

staff in and warmed up.  Jesus... I

don't even know if we've got secure

communications with half our embassies

since that the Soviets got that

cryptographer of ours.

THE PRESIDENT

We can't worry about everything right

now.  We've got to figure out what we're

going to do before we worry about how we

do it.

KENNY

The other thing is...

BOBBY

... I know.  CIA and the military fucked

us on the Bay of Pigs.

KENNY

They're going to be pressing for a

military solution soon.  We can't afford

to let them ram their agenda down our

throats.  We need to come with options

other than air strikes so we have some

sort of choice here.

BOBBY

We got a bunch of smart guys.  We lock

'em up together in there, kick 'em in

the ass til they come up with options.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I'll do it.

KENNY

(to the President)

It's too politicized with you in there,

anyway.  They need to be able to stick

their necks out.

BOBBY

It'll be the principals, a couple of the

key guys from each department: the

Executive Committee of the National

Security Council.  We'll call it EXCOM.

KENNY

EXCOM.  Has a ring to it.  Like F-Troop.

THE PRESIDENT

Okay.  Kenny and I only show for the

meetings you call us into.  Impress us.

And do it fast.

(to Kenny)

You're in charge of keeping this quiet.

If word gets out before we know what

we're going to do, there'll be panic.

And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if

we decide to hit them.

KENNY

Then we need to do a few things right

away.  No Pierre.  He knows, the press

knows.

You're going to have to keep up your

schedule - your movements are followed

too closely.  And we need to get these

guys out of the White House.  George

Ball's got a conference room at State.

(to Bobby)

Reconvene over there this afternoon,

come back here tonight.

BOBBY

I think we should bring in Dean Acheson.

He was fighting Soviets while we were

still working the wards in Boston.

THE PRESIDENT

Find him, Kenny.  We're going to need

all the help we can get.

RESTON

Hey, Kenny!  Who died?

KENNY

Way it's going, the Democratic Party.

DNC strategy session.  If you can call

it that.

ASSISTANT

Sir?

RESTON

It's Tuesday.  You said to call.  When

do I get my 45 minutes?

KENNY

Tell you what.  We're in Connecticut

tomorrow for Ribicoff.  I'll get you up

front with him during the flight.

RESTON

Deal.

ASSISTANT

Sir.

KENNY

What is it?

ASSISTANT

The number you asked for.

KENNY

I ask for a lot of 'em.  Whose is it?

ASSISTANT

Dean Acheson's, sir.

KENNY

Gotta go, Scotty.  See you tomorrow.

BOBBY

Screw secrecy.  You try having that fat

ass sit on your lap all the way from

Foggy Bottom.

MCNAMARA

You were excited.  I say no more.

BOBBY

Everybody agrees the diplomatic route is

out.  It's too slow, and they'll have

the missiles finished.

GENERAL SWEENEY

We have 850 planes assembling at

Homestead, Eglin, Opa Locka, MacDill,

Patrick, Pensacola and Key West.

SMASH CUT TO:

GENERAL SWEENEY (V.O.)

Due to the tropical foliage, the OPLAN

calls for high-explosive and napalm

loadouts for our ground attack sorties.

ADLAI

I still think there are diplomatic

approaches we haven't considered yet.

GENERAL TAYLOR

We have high confidence in the expanded

air strike option.

(beat)

The problem, Mr. President, is that it's

a short-term solution.  Khruschev can

send more missiles next month.  The

Chiefs and I believe we should follow up

the air strikes with the full version of

OPLAN 316.

THE PRESIDENT

An invasion...

GENERAL TAYLOR

Yes, sir.  We can be sure we get all the

missiles, and we remove Castro so this

can never happen again.

THE PRESIDENT

Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?

GENERAL TAYLOR

Yes, sir.  Our best option is to

commence the strikes before the missiles

are operational.  The invasion happens

eight days later.

THE PRESIDENT

Dean.  What do you think?

ACHESON

Mr. President, you have rightly

dismissed the diplomatic option.  The

Soviet will only tie you down in

negotiation, and leave us short of our

goal, the removal of the missiles.

Negotiating will do nothing more than

give them time to make the missiles

operational, complicating the necessary

military task we have at hand.

ACHESON (CONT'D)

For the last fifteen years, I have

fought here at this table along side

your predecessors in the struggle

against the Soviet.  Gentlemen, I do not

wish to seem melodramatic, but I do wish

to impress upon you one observation with

all conceivable sincerity.  A lesson I

have learned with bitter tears and great

sacrifice.

(beat)

The Soviet understands only one

language: action.  It respects only one

word: force.

ACHESON (CONT'D)

I concur with General Taylor.  I

recommend, sir, air strikes followed by

invasion, perhaps preceded by an

ultimatum to dismantle the missiles if

military necessity permits.

THE PRESIDENT

Then it appears we have three options.

Number one.  A surgical air strike

against the missiles themselves.  Two, a

larger air strike against their air

defenses along with the missiles.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

And three, invasion.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

We're certainly going to do number one;

we're going to take out these missiles,

so it seems to me we don't have to wait

very long.  We ought to at least be

making those preparations.

GENERAL TAYLOR

Yes, sir, we're preparing to implement

all three options, though I must stress

again, sir, there are risks to the

strikes without the follow-on invasion.

BUNDY

You want to be clear, Mr. President,

that we have definitely decided against

a political track.

THE PRESIDENT

Dean, how does this play out?

ACHESON

Your first step, sir, will be to demand

that the Soviet withdraw the missiles

within 12 to 24 hours.  They will

refuse.  When they do, you will order

the strikes, followed by the invasion.

They will resist, but will be overrun.

They will retaliate against a target

somewhere else in the world, most likely

Berlin.  We will honor our treaty

commitments and resist them there,

defeating them per our plans.

THE PRESIDENT

Those plans call for the use of nuclear

weapons.

(beat)

And what is the next step?

ACHESON

Hopefully cooler heads will prevail

before we reach the next step.

GENERAL TAYLOR

If McNamara'd get off the fence...

BUNDY

We have time.

GENERAL CARTER

Goddamn it, it's obvious.  It's the only

option.  That asshole, Stevenson.  We

can't let this drag out or we lose our

shot.

BUNDY

Bombing them...

ACHESON

Remember that the Kennedys' father was

one of the architects of Munich.  The

General is right.  There is only one

responsible choice here.

ACHESON (CONT'D)

Let's pray appeasement doesn't run in

families.  I fear weakness does.

KENNY

Jesus Christ Almighty...

KENNY (CONT'D)

Call me Irish, but I don't believe in

cooler heads prevailing.

THE PRESIDENT

Acheson's scenario is unacceptable.  And

he has more experience than anyone.

KENNY

There is no expert on this subject, no

wise old man.

THE PRESIDENT

The thing is, Acheson's right.  Talk

alone won't accomplish anything.

KENNY

Then let's bomb the shit out of them.

Everyone wants to, even you, even me.

(there's a point)

It sure would feel good.

BOBBY

Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but

a sneak attack is just wrong.

KENNY

He's right.  And things are happening

too fast.  It smells like the Bay of

Pigs all over again.

BOBBY

As if dealing with the Russians wasn't

hard enough, we gotta worry about our

own house.

THE PRESIDENT

Tonight, listening to Taylor and

Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles

telling me all I had to do was sign on

the dotted line.  The invasion would

succeed.  Castro would be gone.  Just

like that.  Easy.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

There's something...immoral about

abandoning your own judgement.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

We can't let things get ahead of

themselves.  We've got to control what

happens.

We're going to do what we have to make

this come out right.  EXCOM is our first

weapon.

(beat)

We'll resort to others as we need 'em.

THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)

Doesn't anybody in Connecticut have to

work today?

RESTON

Kenny!  What happened?  They didn't let

me up front, said the President was on

the phone the whole time.

KENNY

He was.

RESTON

Yeah?  Who was he talking to?  Acheson?

Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering

what's going on.  What's Acheson doing

in town?  And don't give me some

bullshit about DNC think tanks.

Acheson's Mr. Cold War.

KENNY

Why don't you ask him yourself?  You can

have him on the way home.

RESTON

I'm giving you a chance here: talk to

me.  You can influence how this thing

unfolds.

EXT. STAIRS TO AIR FORCE ONE - DAY

THE PRESIDENT

Let's get out of here.

KENNY

Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire

White House Press Corps for a day.

BOBBY

No.  No.  No.  There is more than one

option here.  If one isn't occurring to

us, it's because we haven't thought hard

enough.

MCCONE

Sometimes there is only one right

choice, and you thank God when it's

clear.

BOBBY

You're talking about a sneak attack!

How'll that make us look?  Big country

blasting a little one into the stone

age.  We'll be real favorites around the

world.

ACHESON

Bobby, that's naive.  This is the real

world, you know that better than

anybody.  Your argument is ridiculous.

MCCONE

You weren't so ethically particular when

we were talking about options for

removing Castro over at CIA.

BOBBY

I can't let my brother go down in

History like a villain, like a Tojo,

ordering another Pearl Harbor.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Bob.  If we go ahead with these air

strikes...

(beat)

There's got to be something else.  Give

it to me.  I don't care how crazy,

inadequate or stupid it sounds.

(beat, pleading)

Give it to me.

MCNAMARA

Six months ago we gamed out a scenario.

It's slow.  It doesn't get rid of the

missiles.  There are a lot of drawbacks.

(beat)

The scenario was for a blockade of Cuba.

GENERAL TAYLOR

The situation is worse than we thought.

We count 40 missiles now, longer range

IRBMs.  They can hit every city in the

continental U.S.

LEMAY

Mr. President, as of this moment my

planes are ready to carry out the air

strikes.  All you have to do is give me

the word, sir, and my boys will get

those Red bastards.

THE PRESIDENT

How long until the army is ready?

GENERAL TAYLOR

We've just begun the mobilization under

cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir.

We're looking at another week and a

half, Mr. President.

LEMAY

But you can begin the strikes, now.  The

plans call for an eight-day air

campaign.  It'd light a fire under the

army's ass to get in place.

THE PRESIDENT

General LeMay, do you truly believe

that's our best course of action?

LEMAY

Mr. President, I believe it is the only

course of action.  American is in

danger.  Those missiles are a threat to

our bomber bases and the safety of our

nuclear deterrent.  Without our

deterrent, there's nothing to keep the

enemy from choosing general nuclear war.

It's our duty, our responsibility to the

American people to take out those

missiles and return stability to the

strategic situation.  The Big Red Dog is

digging in our back yard, and we're

justified in shooting him.

GENERAL TAYLOR

Sir, we have a rapidly closing window of

opportunity where we can prevent those

missiles from ever becoming operational.

The other options...

GENERAL TAYLOR (CONT'D)

...do not guarantee the end result we

can guarantee.  However, the more time

that goes by, the less reliable the

choice we can offer you becomes.

LEMAY

Mr. President, the motto I chose for SAC

is 'Peace is our Profession.'  God

forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear

exchange.  But if launched, those

missiles in Cuba would kill a lot of

Americans.  That's why I'm being such a

pain in the ass about destroying them.

Destroying them immediately.  Hell, even

Mac agrees.

THE PRESIDENT

General, what will the Soviets do when

we attack?

LEMAY

Nothing.

THE PRESIDENT

Nothing?

LEMAY

Nothing.  Because the only alternative

open to them is one they can't choose.

THE PRESIDENT

Those aren't just missiles we'll be

destroying.  We kill Soviet soldiers,

and they will respond.  How would we

respond if they killed ours?  No, they

will do something, General, I promise

you that.  And I believe it'll be

Berlin.

LEMAY

Those goddamn Kennedys are going to

destroy this country if we don't do

something about this.

KENNY

I was hoping LeMay pushed you.  I

wouldn't mind going a few rounds with

him.

THE PRESIDENT

We knew it was coming.  I tell you,

Kenny, these brass hats have one big

advantage.  We do what they want us to,

none of us will be alive to tell 'em

they were wrong.

SORENSEN

Mr. President, Gromyko should be on his

way by now.

RUSK

We need to go over what you're going to

say.

BOBBY

There's still no sign they know that we

know about the missiles.  Been a lot of

cloud cover; probably think we aren't

getting any good product.

THE PRESIDENT

We keep 'em in the dark as long as we

can.  But I sure as hell am going to

test him.

SALINGER

Kenny, I'm getting funny questions from

the guys in the press office.  As Press

Secretary, I need to know.  What's going

on?

KENNY

They're planning to shave you bald next

time you fall asleep on the bus.

(off Pierre's get-serious look)

Sorry, Pierre, Gromyko just arrived.

RESTON

Are they going to discuss the military

exercises going on in Florida?

KENNY

Come on, Scotty.  This meeting's been on

the books for months.  It's just a

friendly talk on U.S.-Soviet relations.

THE PRESIDENT

So that there should be no

misunderstanding, the position of the

United States, which has been made clear

by the Attorney General to Ambassador

Dobrynin here, I shall read a sentence

from my own statement to the press dated

September 13th.

(beat, reading)

Should missiles or offensive weapons be

placed in Cuba, it would present the

gravest threat to U.S. national

security.

GROMYKO

Mr. President, this will never be done.

You need not be concerned.

THE PRESIDENT

So I do not misunderstand you: there are

no offensive weapons in Cuba.

GROMYKO

No, Mr. President.  We have sent

defensive weapons only to Cuba.

BOBBY

What happened?

THE PRESIDENT

Lying bastard.  Lied to my face.

BOBBY

We're split down the middle.  If I held

a vote I think airstrike would beat

blockade by a vote or two.

THE PRESIDENT

I want a consensus, Bobby.  Consensus.

Either air strike or blockade.

Something everyone'll stand by even if

they don't like it.  I need it by

Saturday.  Make it happen.

BOBBY

What if I can't?

KENNY

We go into this split, the Russians will

know it.  And they'll use it against us.

THE PRESIDENT

Have you cancelled Chicago and the rest

of the weekend yet?

KENNY

You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll

know there's something going on.

THE PRESIDENT

I don't care.  Cancel it.

KENNY

No way.

KENNY (CONT'D)

I'm not calling and cancelling on Daly.

You call and cancel on Daly.

THE PRESIDENT

You're scared to cancel on Daly.

KENNY

Damn right I'm scared.

THE PRESIDENT

Well, I'm not.

BOBBY

Then you'll call, right?

SALINGER

Kenny, all right.  What's going on here?

There's rumors going around an exercise

in the southeast is related to Cuba.

I'm the Press Secretary.  I can't do my

job if I don't know what's going on.  So

what's going on?

KENNY

What are you telling them?

SALINGER

The truth: I don't know.

KENNY

(deadly serious)

Tell 'em you've looked into it, and all

it is is an exercise.  And Pierre --

(beat, loaded)

The President may have a cold tomorrow.

SALINGER

Damn it, Kenny.  Goddamn it!

RESTON

There are major rail disruptions in the

South, two airborne divisions are on

alert.  That exercise is an invasion.

KENNY

Well, you know how Bobby has it in for

the State of Mississippi.

RESTON

This is about Cuba.

KENNY

Cuba?  You're fucking crazy.  We are not

invading Cuba.  Nobody gives a rat's ass

about Cuba.  Not now, not ever.

If you print something like that, all

you're going to do is inflame the

situation.  Nobody talks to assholes who

inflame situations.  Assholes like that

can find themselves cut out of the loop.

RESTON

You've never threatened me before.

RESTON (CONT'D)

All right.  I'm not going to print

anything until I have another source.

But I promise you, I'll get one.

KENNY

(to Assistant)

Tell Pierre I need to talk to him.

(to phone)

Bobby?

BOBBY

Bring him back.

SALINGER

The President has a cold.  He is

cancelling the remainder of this trip

and is returning to Washington on the

advice of his doctor.

RUSK

Mr. President, our deliberations have

led us to the conclusion that, for the

moment, a blockade of offensive weapons

to Cuba is our best option.  But we'll

still need a strong showing of support

from the Organization of American States

to give us an umbrella of legitimacy.

MCNAMARA

A blockade is technically an act of war,

therefore we recommend calling the

action a quarantine.

MCNAMARA (V.O.)

There are between 20 and 30 Soviet ships

underway to Cuba at this time.

MCNAMARA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

800 miles out, the navy will stop them,

board, and any vessels containing

weapons will be turned back.

CUT TO:

MCNAMARA

A quarantine prevents more missiles from

reaching Cuba, but it doesn't remove the

ones already there.  It gives the

Soviets a chance to pull back without

war.  If they refuse to remove the

missiles before they're operational, we

retain the option to strike or invade.

BOBBY

We believe that a surprise attack would

be counter to what the United States

stands for.  We believe that an attack

leaves us no room for maneuver, and the

inevitable Soviet response will force us

into a war we do not want.  A war that,

this time, will really end all war.

MCCONE

Mr. President, there are still those of

us who believe we should proceed with

the strikes.  With the blockade, we lose

strategic surprise and we run the risk

of a first strike if the Soviets decide

they have to use the missiles or lose

them.

THE PRESIDENT

Quarantine or air strike.

ADLAI

There is a third option.  With either

course we undertake the risk of nuclear

war.  It seems to me maybe one of us in

here should be a coward.

ADLAI (CONT'D)

So I guess I'll be.  Our third choice is

to cut a deal.  We trade Guantanamo and

our missiles in Turkey, get them to pull

their missiles out.  We employ a back

channel, attribute the idea to U Thant.

U Thant then raises it at the U.N.

THE PRESIDENT

I don't think that's possible, Adlai.

(beat, to the room)

I will be asking the networks for air

time Monday night.  I have not yet made

my final decision.  We will announce our

course of action then.  I want to thank

you all for your advice, gentlemen.

BOBBY

Goddman Stevenson.  Jesus.  Peace at any

price.  You'd think nobody learned

anything from World War Two.

THE PRESIDENT

Somebody had to say it.  I respect Adlai

for having the guts to risk looking like

an appeaser.

BOBBY

We have to pull him.  He's not going to

be able to handle the Soviets in front

of the U.N.  Zorin will eat him alive.

THE PRESIDENT

We've got bigger problems right now.

KENNY

We have to try the blockades.  It

probably won't work.  It may just be

delaying the inevitable.  But we can't

just go to war without trying not to.

THE PRESIDENT

I don't know.  I don't know.

ADLAI

Just can't get away from you guys.

Escaping for a night on the town, eh?

KENNY

As the town's most popular playboy, the

President felt my presence would be

sorely missed.  So in the interests of

National Security...

ADLAI

Gotta keep up appearances.  Of course, I

don't care anymore.  I'm a political

dead man.  You ever seen a man cut his

own throat like I did today?

ADLAI (CONT'D)

Well, it's all right.

(beat)

I came to tell you, just talked to a

friend.  Reston and Frankel have the

story.  It's going to run tomorrow.

KENNY

We're not going to make it to Monday.

I'll try to lean on Reston, but you're

going to have to call Orville Dryfoos.

This is the sort of decision the

publisher makes himself.

INT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

DRYFOOS

Yes, sir, I understand.  But we held on

Bay of Pigs and it was the biggest

mistake of my life.  What makes this any

different?

THE PRESIDENT

I'm asking you to hold the story until I

can present our course of action on

Monday night.

DRYFOOS

All right.  But I need a reason to give

my boys.  They're going to be screaming

for my head on a plate.

THE PRESIDENT

Orville.  I want you to tell them this:

they'll be saving lives.  Maybe even

including their own.

DRYFOOS

Yes, Mr. President.

KENNY

Acheson called, DeGaulle's with us;

haven't heard from anyone else yet.

BOBBY

He wants to talk to LeMay again.

THE PRESIDENT

Cam, can you guarantee me you'll get all

the missiles?

GENERAL SWEENEY

Sir, I can guarantee we'll get all the

missiles we know about.

LEMAY

Mr. President, we can get better than

ninety percent of them.

THE PRESIDENT

As of seven o'clock Monday night, all

United States armed forces world wide

will stand up to DEFCON 3.

KENNY

You'd worry that something was wrong if

Congress offered you unconditional

support.

THE PRESIDENT

They want this fucking job, they can

have it.  It's no great joy to me.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

The elected representatives of the

people have spoken...

(beat; determined)

Now let's tell the people...

THE PRESIDENT

Good evening, my fellow citizens.  This

Government, as promised, has maintained

the closest surveillance of the Soviet

military build-up on the island of

Cuba...

THE PRESIDENT (V.O.)

...unmistakable evidence has now

established the fact that a series of

missile sites is in preparation on that

imprisoned island.  The purpose of these

bases can be none other than to proved a

nuclear strike capability against the

Western Hemisphere...

THE PRESIDENT (V.O.)

Therefore, in the defense of our own

security and under the authority of the

Constitution, I have directed that the

following initial steps be taken.

First, to halt this offensive build-up,

a strict quarantine --

THE PRESIDENT (V.O.)

-- on all offensive military equipment

under shipment to Cuba is being

initiated.  All ships of any kind bound

for Cuba, if found to contain cargoes of

offensive weapons, will be turned back.

Second: I have directed the continued

and increased close surveillance of Cuba

and its military build-up.  Should these

offensive military preparations

continue, further action will be

justified --

THE PRESIDENT (V.O.)

-- I have directed the Armed Forces to

prepare for any eventualities.

THE PRESIDENT

And third: it shall be the policy of

this nation to regard any nuclear

missile launched from Cuba against any

nation in the Western Hemisphere as an

attack by the Soviet Union on the United

States, requiring a full retaliatory

response upon the Soviet Union...

BOBBY

We're getting the Soviet response.

KENNY

This is all rhetoric.

(realizing)

They don't know how to respond yet.

THE PRESIDENT

So now you're Khurschev.  What do you

do?

KENNY

-- run the blockade.  They'll run the

blockade.

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

Which is exactly what they appear to be

preparing to do, Mr. President.  We're

tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba.

There's no sign they're changing course.

The closest ships, the Gagarin and the

Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line

by this time tomorrow.

MCNAMARA

We're concerned about the possibility of

an incident with an innocent cargo

carrier.  If it turns ugly, the Russians

could use an ugly incident and bad world

opinion as leverage to force us to

remove the quarantine.

MCCONE

Or they could use it as an excuse to

escalate.

BOBBY

Admiral Anderson, if the ships do not

stop, what exactly are our rules of

engagement?

ADMIRAL ANDERSON (V.O.)

Russian-speakers have been transferred

to all of our ships.  Once the

quarantine takes effect in the morning,

our ships will attempt to make radio

contact with the approaching vessels.

They will be ordered to reduce speed and

prepare for inspection.

ADMIRAL ANDERSON (V.O.)

An inspection party will then board and

search the ship.  If weapons are found,

the ship will be ordered to leave the

quarantine area or be towed into port

upon refusal.

BOBBY

What happens if the ship doesn't stop

for inspection or want to be towed?

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

A warning shot will be fired across its

bow.

BOBBY

And what happens if the ship ignores the

warning shot?

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

Then we fire at its rudder, disable it,

and carry out the inspection.

THE PRESIDENT

There will be no shooting without my

explicit orders.  Is that understood?

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

Yes, sir.

THE PRESIDENT

Well, Admiral, it looks like it's up to

the Navy.

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

The Navy won't let you down, sir.

THE PRESIDENT

General, have we developed any more

information on the missiles?

GENERAL TAYLOR

They are continuing to proceed with the

development.  We're commencing low-level

photography runs this morning.

MCCONE

The pictures will be used to firm up our

estimates of the missiles' readiness and

develop target packages for strikes

should you order them.

GENERAL TAYLOR

Our guy running this show is the best.

Commander Bill Ecker of the Navy's VFP

62, the Fightin' Photo.  Something of a

character, but the highest efficiency

ratings we've ever had.

ECKER

75 millimeter, I'm listening.  On the

big screen there's nothing like it.

GENERAL TAYLOR (V.O.)

To protect our pilots, we're prepared to

retaliate against any SAM site or anti

aircraft battery that opens fire.

WILHEMY

Watch out, Hollywood.  There's a new

epic director in town!

GENERAL TAYLOR

We have a flight of Thunderchiefs able

to respond within minutes of an attack

on our planes.

KENNY

I don't like what's happening.

THE PRESIDENT

In the morning I'm taking charge of the

blockade from the situation room.

McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot

at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things

there.

KENNY

All right.  'Cause you get armed

boarders climbing into Soviet ships,

shots being fired across bows...

THE PRESIDENT

I know, I know...

KENNY

What about these low-level flights?

They're starting in what?  An hour?  Do

you realize what you're letting yourself

in for?

THE PRESIDENT

We need those flights.  We have to know

when those missiles become operational,

because when they do, we need to destroy

them.

KENNY

Fair enough.  But Castro's on alert and

we're flying attack planes over their

sites, on the deck.  There's no way for

them to know they're carrying cameras,

not bombs.  They're going to be shot at,

plain and simple.

KENNY (CONT'D)

I'm your political advisor, and I'm

giving you political analysis here.

This is a setup.  The Chiefs want to go

in.  It's the only way they can redeem

themselves for the Bay of Pigs.  They

have to go in, and they have to do it

right.  It's that simple.

THE PRESIDENT

I'm gonna protect those pilots.

KENNY

They're boxing us in with these rules of

engagement.  If you agree to 'em, and

one of our planes gets knocked down or

one of the ships won't stop for

inspection, the Chiefs will have us by

the balls and will force us to start

shooting.  They want a war, and they're

arranging things to get one.  If you

don't want one, we have to do something

about it.

THE PRESIDENT

How does a man get to a place where he

can say, 'throw those lives away,' so

easily?

KENNY

Maybe it's harder for them to say it

than they let on.

At the very least, they believe it's in

our best interest.  And at the end of

the day, they may end up being right.

THE PRESIDENT

Triple check everything the Chiefs say

to us with the guys who actually have to

do it.  No one's to know about this but

Bobby.  I need redundant control over

what happens out there.  And if things

aren't as advertised, you're going to

make sure they come out the way I want

them to come out, starting with this low

level flight thing.

KENNY

That's going to be tough.  You know how

these guys are about their chains of

command...

THE PRESIDENT

Any problems, you remind them those

chains of commands end at one place.

Me.

RUSK

Mr. President. The OAS meeting starts in

an hour.  I haven't prepared at all.  We

can't expect --

THE PRESIDENT

-- we need this one, Dean.  The

quarantine's legal if we get a mandate,

otherwise it's an act of war in the eyes

of the world.  Get me that vote.  Make

it unanimous.

RUSK

Mr. President, The Organization of

American States hasn't had a unanimous

vote since --

THE PRESIDENT

-- unanimous, Dean.

MARGARET

White House Operator.  Yes sir.

(beat, harsh, booming)

Speaker McCormack, hold for the Vice

President.

KENNY

Ma'am, would you mind helping me out

with a few special calls?

ECKER

Orson Welles is a hack.  Now you want to

talk about a director, you talk about

David Lean...

WILHEMY

Welles is a G-d.  Lean's the hack.

ECKER

Bullshit, Bruce, nobody but Lean is

making decent movies these days.

(to Young Pilot)

Get that fixed yet?

YOUNG PILOT

Uhhh... yup.  Think so.

DUTY SERGEANT

Sir...telephone, sir.

ECKER

VFP-62, Fightin' Photo, here.  But what

we really want to do is direct.

INTERCUT CALL TO:

MARGARET

This is the White House Operator.  Hold

for the President.

ECKER

Oh shit.

MARGARET

Honey, you don't know what shit is.

KENNY

Commander, my name is Ken O'Donnell.

Special Assistant to the President.

INTERCUT CALL TO:

ECKER

Yes, sir.

KENNY (O.S.)

The President has instructed me to pass

along an order to you.

(beat)

You are not to get shot down.

ECKER

Uh... we'll do our best, sir.

KENNY

I don't think you understand me

correctly.  You are not to get shot down

under any circumstances.  Whatever

happens up there, you were not shot at.

Mechanical failures are fine; crashing

into mountains, fine.  But you and your

men are not to be shot at, fired at,

launched upon.

ECKER

Excuse me, sir, what's going on here?

KENNY

Commander, if you are fired upon, the

President will be forced to attack the

sites that fire on you.  He doesn't want

to have to do that.  It's very important

that he doesn't, or things could go very

badly out of control.

ECKER

I think I understand.  What about my

men?  If it comes up hot and heavy, and

we don't have anyone to protect us...

I'm going to be writing letters to

parents.  I hate writing letters to

parents.

KENNY

If the President protects you,

Commander, he may have to do it with the

Bomb.

KENNY (V.O.)

I've known the man for fifteen years.

The problem is, he will protect you.  So

I'm asking: don't make him protect you.

Don't get shot at.

ECKER

Okay, Mr. O'Donnell.  We'll do what we

can.

ECKER

Get that fuel assayed?

WILHEMY

Yeah.  It sucks.  Ain't for high

performance babies like ours.  Shoulda

brought some from home, but what can you

do?  Last-second deployments...

INT. ECKER'S CRUSADER - DAY

ECKER

Okay, time to play Spin the Bottle with

our bearded buddy.  Nobody gets out

ahead.  Remember, just sitting here

we're only ten minutes from target.

ECKER

Go to military throttle on my mark.

Three...two...one... mark.

PILOT #1 (O.S.)

Flameout flameout!

PILOT #2 (O.S.)

Shit!  Me too!

ECKER

Get some altitude!

PILOT #1 (O.S.)

Oh, God damn.  Got it restarted.

PILOT #2 (O.S.)

Yeah.  Yeah.  Me too.  Goddamn fuel.

PILOT #1 (O.S.)

Sir, I don't think she's gonna hold up

for the run.

ECKER

Affirmative.  You two get out of here.

ECKER

Start your camera checks.

PILOT #3 (O.S.)

Failure.  All cameras.  Sonofabitch.

Film must not have fed.

PILOT #4 (O.S.)

Jesus!  Shit!  Oh shit!  I just shot it

all, boss.  Activator jammed open, its

exposing everything now.

WILHEMY (O.S.)

That's alright, Lenny, it happens to

most men at some time --

ECKER

-- Scrub, you two.  Get out of here.

Still with me, Bruce?

WILHEMY (O.S.)

That's affirm.

ECKER (O.S.)

Warm 'em up.  We're here.

WILHEMY

Holy shit!

ECKER

Lights.

ECKER (CONT'D)

Camera.

ECKER (CONT'D)

Action.

GROUND CREW CHIEF

Lookit what daddy done brung home.

WILHEMY

You shoulda seen it, Chief, they --

ECKER

-- damn sparrows.  Must've been

migrating.  Guess I hit a couple

hundred.

(to Wilhemy, stern)

How many did you hit, Bruce?

WILHEMY

A few.  I guess.

GROUND CREW CHIEF

Was them 20 or 40 million sparrows?

ECKER

Those are bird strikes.  Sparrows to be

precise.  Got a problem with that?

WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.)

Massive military preparations are

underway throughout the southeast in

what Pentagon officials are confirming

is the largest mobilization since Korea.

The railways have been nationalized to

assist in the deployment, here

transporting elements of the U.S. 1st

Armored Division from Ft. Hood, Texas.

KENNY

Yeah?

BALL

Kenny.  The vote just came down.

RUSK

Unanimous.  One abstenation.

THE PRESIDENT

About time something went our way.

ASSISTANT

Telephone, Mr. O'Donnell.

KENNY

Hello?

INTERCUT CALL TO:

ECKER

Mr. O'Donnell, I've been ordered to

deliver the film to the Pentagon

personally.  What's going on?

KENNY

The Chiefs must want to talk to you.

(beat)

Listen to me, Commander, they'll want to

know if you were fired on.  Were you?

ECKER (O.S.)

You could say that, sir.

KENNY

Commander.  Do not, under any

circumstances, tell the Chiefs.

ECKER

Commander William B. Ecker reporting as

ordered!

LEMAY

Son , I want to know just one thing.

Those bastards shoot so much as a BB gun

at you?

ECKER

Sir, it was a milk run, sir.

GENERAL TAYLOR

It appears our low-level flights are

getting back okay.  Some unconfirmed

reports of small-arms fire from some of

the missions, but that's it.

THE PRESIDENT

Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few

patriotic farmers.  And the ships?

GENERAL TAYLOR

Still heading for Cuba.

THE PRESIDENT

All right.  Then I guess it's time.

THE PRESIDENT

In accordance with this afternoon's vote

at the OAS, the quarantine shall hereby

be effective as of ten o'clock tomorrow

morning.

THE PRESIDENT

Last summer I read a book.  The Guns of

August.  I wish every man on that

blockade line had read that book.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

World War One.  Thirteen million killed

all because the militaries of both

alliances were so highly attuned to each

other's movements and dispositions,

afraid of letting the other guy have a

theoretical advantage.  And your man in

the field, his family at home, couldn't

even tell you the reasons why their

lives were being sacrificed.

(beat)

Why couldn't they stop it?

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

And here we are, fifty years later.  One

of their ships resists the inspection.

We shoot out its rudder and board.  They

shoot down our planes in response.  We

bomb their anti-aircraft sites in

response to that.  They attack Berlin.

We invade Cuba.  They fire their

missiles.  We fire ours.

HELEN (O.S.)

When are you going to be home?

KENNY

I don't know, Helen.  I want you to keep

the kids close tomorrow.  Leave the T.V.

on, sleep with it on in the bedroom

until I tell you you can turn it off.

HELEN (O.S.)

What's happened?

KENNY

Nothing.  Nothing you don't know about.

Tomorrow's the big day.  Just have the

car ready to go if I call or if the

Civil Defense Warning comes on.

HELEN (O.S.)

What happens to you?  I'm not leaving

without you.

KENNY

I'll be evacuated with the President.

HELEN (O.S.)

Great.  So while you're under a rock

somewhere with the President, what am I

supposed to do with your five children?

KENNY

I'll find you.  But we're not going to

let it come to that.  I promise.

KENNY

Helen just asked me what sort of

arrangements we have for the families.

BUNDY

I just checked myself.

(beat)

They're being issued identity cards.

Call comes, and evacuation officers meet

them at pre-arranged departure areas.

They go by helicopter to Mount Weather.

We meet them there.

BOBBY

Course that's for morale.  The missiles

only take five minutes to get here.

POLICE OFFICER

Would you like me to call a car, Mr.

O'Donnell.

KENNY

How long will it take to get someone up?

POLICE OFFICER

Fifteen minutes, maybe.  To your house,

sir?

KENNY

No.  No, I'll let her sleep.  Let 'em

sleep.

THE PRESIDENT

Okay, Bob, I'm putting you on intercom.

MCNAMARA (O.S.)

Hey, guys, can you hear me?

SMASH CUT TO:

MCNAMARA

I have one minute til ten here --

MCNAMARA (CONT'D)

-- and no sign of them stopping.

THE PRESIDENT

Bob, the quarantine is now in effect.

MCNAMARA

Then it looks like our first customers

are the Gagarin and Kimovsk.

CAPTAIN

Helm, shape heading for intercept, zero

one zero.  All ahead full --

OFFICER (O.S.)

-- new contact!  New contact!

CHIEF SONARMAN

Submerged contact, designation Sierra

one at 6000 yards bearing 030.

CAPTAIN

A submarine...

GENERAL TAYLOR

It's protecting the freighters.

THE PRESIDENT

Bob, is there any way we can avoid

stopping a submarine first?

MCNAMARA (O.S.)

I'm afraid not, Mr. President.  The sub

has positioned itself between the Pierce

and the Soviet ships.  Admiral Anderson

insists it's too much of a risk to

proceed with stopping the freighters.

The Pierce would be a sitting duck for

the sub.

THE PRESIDENT

Put me through to the Pierce.

CAPTAIN

Mr. President?

THE PRESIDENT

Captain, can you force that submarine to

the surface for inspection without

damaging it yourself?

CAPTAIN

I can bring it up, Mr. President.  But

whether it's damaged or not is up to the

sub.

MCCONE

Even if they force it up, that sub will

be inspected over the crews' dead

bodies.  They'd be executed for allowing

it when they got home.

THE PRESIDENT

Captain, force the sub to the surface

for inspection.

MCNAMARA (O.S.)

Mr. President!  We're receiving reports

that the ships are stopping!

THE PRESIDENT

(to phone)

Captain, belay that order!

(to McNamara)

Bob, where's that coming from!

MCNAMARA (O.S.)

Just a second, Mr. President.

THE PRESIDENT

Will somebody find out what's going on?!

RUSK

Are they stopping?

MCNAMARA (O.S.)

Mr. President?

MCNAMARA

-- we've got reports coming from all

over!  The ships are stopping!  Some...

are turning around!

RUSK

We were eyeball to eyeball and I think

the other fellow just blinked.

MCCONE

Mr. President.

MCCONE (CONT'D)

Mr. President!

MCCONE (CONT'D)

Sir, we have the tally from NSA.  We

have twenty ships stopping and or

turning around.  Six, however, appear to

be continuing for the line.  Including

the Gagarin and Kimovsk.

THE PRESIDENT

Captain, have the ships you're observing

changed course?

CAPTAIN (O.S.)

No, Mr. President.  They've just crossed

the quarantine line.

BOBBY

It's an accident.  They must not have

gotten their orders yet.  Let 'em go.

GENERAL TAYLOR

Unlikely, Mr. President.  We've been

monitoring transmissions from both the

Gagarin and Kimovsk.  Their radios are

working fine.

MCCONE

One ship, an accident maybe.  Six: this

is intentional.

KENNY

They're right.  This is intentional.

KENNY (CONT'D)

Khruschev's stopped the 20 ships which

are carrying contraband, and he's

letting the ones which aren't go

through, hoping for an incident.  I

think we should let them go.

MCCONE

If we do, it erodes the credibility of

the quarantine.  He'll just send more

through tomorrow.

KENNY

Then we deal with it tomorrow.  But

today he's stopped most of them.  He's

done something smart here.  We gave him

an ultimatum, and he's agreed to most of

it, preserving just enough room to save

face.  We need to do something just as

smart now.

INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

MCNAMARA

Mr. President, I agree.  Let them go.

Four of the six continuing ships are

still a day away from the line.  They've

stopped all the ones we suspect have

weapons aboard.

It would look bad shooting up a

freighter full of baby food.

THE PRESIDENT

Captain, I want you to maintain contact

with those ships.  Do nothing until I

order otherwise.  Is that clear?

CAPTAIN (O.S.)

Yes, Mr. President.  Contact only.

THE PRESIDENT

I hope you're right.

BOBBY

What happened to speak when spoken to?

KENNY

Give it a rest.  You were thinking the

same thing, just didn't have the guts to

take the heat.

THE PRESIDENT

We can horsetrade with Khruschev on

ships.  But it doesn't get us any closer

to removing those missiles.

KENNY

Have to hope it's a signal that he'll

back down on the real issue too.

BOBBY

We're going to have to stop a ship

eventually, show the quarantine's got

teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.

THE PRESIDENT

McNamara's on his way back here now.  We

need to pick the right ship.  No subs.

No armed boarding parties either.  We

need a little more time to figure this

one out.

KENNY

Then let's move the quarantine line.

MCNAMARA

Mr. President.  Bobby.  Kenny.  The

Essex battle group has the Gagarin,

Kimovsk and the sub escort under their

thumb.  We've got a few hours now before

we need to worry about any more

flashpoints on the line.

(beat)

We could use a few more hours.  I think

we should consider moving the quarantine

line back to 500 miles.

KENNY

Moving the line.  Stroke of genius.

MCNAMARA

(snappish)

Of course it is.  But the President

needs to realize we're going to have to

stop a ship eventually.

KENNY

The Chiefs are looking for a provocation

out there.  The President's going to

come under enormous pressure.  You have

to keep 'em on a short leash, Bob.

MCNAMARA

You must think I'm blind and stupid.

I've already gotten the birds and bees

from Bobby.  The President doesn't have

to double-barrel me.

KENNY

Listen to me, goddamn it.  We're talking

about a possible nuclear war.  You

dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --

MCNAMARA

-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't

drop --

KENNY

You were in the room.  It was your

purview.  It was your job to make sure

Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you

didn't do it.  You've got the most

important job in the world right now.

You're the smartest guy the President

has.

(beat)

Besides me.

MCNAMARA

Anybody ever tell you you're an

egomaniac and a prick, O'Donnell?

KENNY

You need to be the best you've ever

been.

WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.)

-- well, it appears the world has just

received a reprieve.  Defense Secretary

Robert McNamara has announced that the

quarantine zone has been moved from 800

to 500 miles.

KENNY

Find out how close our exercises are

coming to their cruise missiles.  I'm

calling you back in five, and you will

have an answer for me or I will come

down there and beat the shit out of you.

(beat)

Then you can press charges, and I'll get

a Presidential pardon.

THE PRESIDENT

-- how the goddamn hell did this happen?

I'm going to have Power's head on a

platter next to LeMay's!

(noticing Kenny)

Hey, Kenny, did you hear me give the

order to go to DEFCON 2?  I remember

giving the order to go to DEFCON 3, but

I must be suffering from amnesia because

I've just been informed our nuclear

forces are DEFCON 2!

SMASH CUT TO:

GENERAL TAYLOR (V.O.)

Mr. President, the orders were limited

to our strategic forces in the

continental U.S.

GENERAL TAYLOR

Technically, General LeMay is correct

that SAC has the statutory authority --

THE PRESIDENT

-- I have the authority.  I am the

commander-in-chief of the United States,

and I say when we go to war!

GENERAL TAYLOR

We are not at war, sir, not until we're

at DEFCON 1.

THE PRESIDENT

General, the Joint Chiefs have just

signalled our intent to escalate to the

Soviets.  You have signalled an

escalation which I had no wish to

signal, and which I did not approve.

BOBBY

LeMay... he's history.

THE PRESIDENT

Get out of here, Max.

KENNY

Jesus...

BOBBY

Rescind the order.  Can all the Chiefs.

Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the

Undersecretaries in charge.

KENNY

We can't do that, Bobby.

THE PRESIDENT

He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2.

The Soviets will think we've gotten

sweet on them.

KENNY

And we can't purge the Chiefs.  Our

invasion talk will look like a bluff.

Or even that there's been an attempted

coup.

BOBBY

McNamara won't be able to handle them.

It's too much for one man...

(knowing look to Kenny)

...with all due respect to our heroic

fifth column.

KENNY

We've got Khruschev's attention with the

blockade.  If we want a political

solution.  I think it's time to turn up

the diplomatic heat.  Cause if we let

this go on too long, we're going to find

ourselves in a war.

THE PRESIDENT

I've been considering a variation on one

of Stevenson's ideas.  We're going to

send up a trial balloon through Lippman.

The Jupiter missiles.

BUNDY

What did you think of Lippman's column

this morning?

KENNY

I think it's a bad idea.

BUNDY

Thank God.  Look, everyone is furious

about it.  We trade away our missiles in

Turkey and we're fucked politically.

BUNDY (CONT'D)

You gotta stop 'em.  We know it's Jack

and Bobby's idea - they leaked it to

Lippman.  The military guys are going

ape, and they're not alone.

KENNY

Then they should speak up.

BUNDY

Christ, Ken, you know it's not that

easy.

KENNY

Yes it is.

BUNDY

No it isn't.  They don't trust the

people that feel this way.  But these

people are right.  And the Kennedys are

wrong.

(beat)

We need you to tell 'em, Kenny.  They'll

listen to you.

BUNDY (CONT'D)

Jack and Bobby are good men.  But it

takes a certain character, moral

toughness to stand up to --

KENNY

-- You listen to me.  Nobody, nobody,

talks about my friends that way.  You're

fucking here right now because of the

Kennedys.  They may be wrong.  They make

mistakes.  But they're not weak.

The weak ones are these 'people' who

can't speak their own minds.

BUNDY

You know I don't mean they're weak.

KENNY

No, they just lack 'moral toughness.'

And you think I'll play your Judas.  You

WASPS and blue-bloods never understood

us, thinking we want into your club.

Well we got our own club now.

(beat)

And you guys don't realize fighting with

each other is our way.  Nobody plays us

off each other.  And nobody ever gets

between us...

THE PRESIDENT

What's that?

KENNY

Oh, just a bunch of crap about

withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in

Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in

Cuba.

THE PRESIDENT

I don't want to listen to this again.

KENNY

If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to

extortion, and NATO would never trust us

again.  We'll get clobbered in world

opinion.

THE PRESIDENT

It's a goddman trial balloon.  Trial is

the operative word, here.

KENNY

Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.

THE PRESIDENT

Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one

saying we need to move forward on a

political solution.

KENNY

Yeah, a good political solution.

TRANSLATOR FOR ZORIN (O.S.)

We call on the world to condemn the

piratical actions of America...

THE PRESIDENT

You want to turn up the heat?  You call

Adlai.  Tell him to stick it to Zorin.

BOBBY

Adlai's too weak!  We have to convince

Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.

KENNY

You can't take him out this late in the

game.

BOBBY

Zorin will eat him alive!

KENNY

Then talk to your brother, goddamn it.

The two of you don't need any advice to

get into trouble.

BOBBY

What's gotten into you?

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Oh, still sore about this.

KENNY

Something your father would've come up

with.

BOBBY

My father --

KENNY

-- I'm just trying to make a point.

This idea is that fucking bad.

KENNY (CONT'D)

Adlai can handle Zorin.  He knows the

inning and the score.

BOBBY

He better.  Because nobody thinks he's

up to this.  Nobody.

ADLAI

Yes?

KENNY

Adlai, it's Kenny.  How're you doing?

ADLAI

Busy, Ken. What do you need?

KENNY

The President told me to pass the word

to you: stick it to them.

KENNY

Adlai.  The world has to know we're

right.  If we're going to have a chance

at a political solution, we need

international pressure.  You got to be

tough, Adlai.  You need to find it, old

friend.

ADLAI

I hear you.  I'm glad it's you calling.

I thought it would be Bobby.  If they're

still sticking to their stonewall

strategy, I'll get 'em.

(beat)

Thanks, Ken.

ADLAI (CONT'D)

I'm an old political cat, Jimmy.

(beat)

But I've got one life left.

ADLAI

Wait here.

ROMANIAN DELEGATE

(through translator)

...we call upon the world to condemn

this purely American provocation...

ROMANIAN DELEGATE (CONT'D)

We, the people of Romania, stand in

solidarity with the people of Cuba and

their revolution in the face of this

American threat to world peace.  Thank

you, Mr. Chairman.

ZORIN

(through translator)

We are glad you could join us, Mr.

Stevenson.

ZORIN (CONT'D)

For the last couple of hours I have

heard nothing but questions from the

world here.  The United States has led

us to the brink of calamity.  The

peoples of the world want to know why.

We are told again and again of this so

called incontrovertible evidence of

offensive weapons in Cuba.  Yet we are

not allowed to see this evidence.  Are

your spy planes so secret you cannot

share this evidence with us?  Some

planes?!

ZORIN (CONT'D)

Or perhaps there is no such evidence.

Perhaps the United States is mistaken.

BOBBY

I make the call, and Adlai is out.

McCloy goes in.

THE PRESIDENT

Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

ZORIN

The United States has no facts in hand.

Falsity is what America has in its hands

- false evidence.

ZORIN (CONT'D)

The chair recognizes the representative

from the United States.

ADLAI

Well, let me say something to you, Mr.

Ambassador, we do have the evidence.  We

have it, and it is clear and

incontrovertible.

ADLAI (CONT'D)

And let me say something else.  Those

weapons must be taken out of Cuba.  You,

the Soviet Union, have created this new

danger, not the United States.

BUNDY

Come on, Adlai!

ADLAI

Mr. Zorin, I remind you that the other

day you did not deny the existence of

these weapons.  But today, again, if I

heard you correctly, you now say they do

not exist.

RUSK

Come on, Adlai, don't let him off!

BOBBY

John?  It's Bobby.  Get ready to send

your staffer in.  He's going to be

coming out.

ADLAI

All right, sir.  Let me ask you one

simple question.  Do you, Ambassador

Zorin, deny that the U.S.S.R. has placed

and is placing medium and intermediate

range missiles and sites in Cuba?  Yes

or no - don't wait for the translation -

yes or no?

KENNY

Yeah.  Yeah.

ZORIN

I am not in an American courtroom, sir,

and therefore I do not wish to answer a

question that is put to me in the

fashion in which a prosecutor puts

questions.  In due course, sir, you will

have your answer.

ADLAI

You are in the courtroom of world

opinion right now, and you can answer

yes or no.  You have denied they exist,

and I want to know if I have understood

you correctly.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

BOBBY

John, I'll get back to you.

ADLAI

And I'm prepared to present the evidence

in this room, proving that the Soviet

Union has lied to the world.

ZORIN

If you do not choose to continue your

statement, the Chair recognizes the

representative from Chile.

CHILEAN DELEGATE

I yield my time and the floor to the

representative to the United States.

ADLAI

Well then, ladies and gentlemen, since

it appears we might be here for a while,

shall we have a look at what the Soviets

are doing in Cuba?

THE PRESIDENT

Didn't know Adlai had it in him.  Too

bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.

KENNY

Zorin must not have gotten instructions.

Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's

blown it big-time.

BUNDY

Mr. President...

MCNAMARA

...the ship is called Groznyy.

MCNAMARA (V.O.)

We lost track of it yesterday at

nightfall.  We thought we gave it plenty

of room when we moved the quarantine

line back.  We just reacquired it.

MCNAMARA

It crossed the line hours ago.

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

Hail them again.

THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)

Keep us posted, Bob.

MCNAMARA

We're kidding ourselves...

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

Very well.  Load your guns.

MCNAMARA

What was that, Admiral?

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

We've been hailing the Groznyy for the

last hour, Mr. Secretary.  The Groznyy

refuses to stop.

MCNAMARA

What are you doing?

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary.

If you don't mind, we're very busy right

now.  We need to be able to do our jobs.

MCNAMARA

Admiral, I asked you a question.

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

We're going to follow the Rules of

Engagement.  The Rules of Engagement

which the President has approved and

signed in his order of October 23rd.

ADMIRAL ANDERSON (CONT'D)

Yes, Captain, you may proceed.  Clear

your guns.

MCNAMARA

What --

MCNAMARA

GODDAMNIT, STOP THAT FIRING!

MCNAMARA (CONT'D)

Jesus Christ, God help us.

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

That ship was firing starshells.

Starshells.  Flares, Mr. Secretary.

ADMIRAL ANDERSON (CONT'D)

Goddammitt, I've got a job to do.

You've been camped out up there since

Monday night.  You're exhausted and

you're making mistakes.  Interfere with

me, you will get some of killed.  I will

not allow that.

MCNAMARA

Starshells.

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary.  The

navy has been running blockades since

the days of John Paul Jones.

MCNAMARA

I believe the President made it clear

that there would be no firing on ships

without his express permission.

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we

were not firing on the ship.  Firing on

a ship means attacking the ship.  We

were not attacking the ship.  We were

firing over it.

MCNAMARA

This was not the President's intention

when he gave that order.  What if the

Soviets don't see the distention?  What

if they make the same mistake I just

did?

(beat)

There will be no firing anything near

ANY Soviet ships without my express

permission, is that understood, Admiral?

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

Yes, sir.

MCNAMARA

And I will only issue such instructions

when ordered to by the President.

(beat)

John Paul Jones... you don't understand

a thing, do you, Admiral?

MCNAMARA (CONT'D)

This isn't a blockade.

MCNAMARA (CONT'D)

This, all this, is language, a new

vocabulary the likes of which the world

has never seen.

This is President Kennedy communicating

with Secretary Khruschev.

WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.)

At 7:29 this morning, the U.S.S. Joseph

Kennedy stopped and boarded the Soviet

charter vessel Marcula.

WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

After a 3-hour inspection, the Kennedy

signaled no contraband found.  Cleared

to continue.  Pentagon spokesmen expect

the next encounter.

RUSK

Kenny, we need to see the President.

Something's happened.

SCALI

I have lunch with him maybe once a

month.  Way he talks, he acts like he

knows Khruschev personally, but he's

never elaborated.  I've used him as a

source in a couple of stories.

RUSK

The FBI has identified this Alexander

Fomin as the Soviet Resident, the KGB

equivalent of one of our station chiefs.

He's their highest ranking spy in this

country.  And he knows John's a friend

of mine.

BUNDY

All the trademarks of a back-channel

overture.

THE PRESIDENT

So they'll remove the missiles, and

we'll pledge not to invade Cuba,

destabilize Castro or assist anyone who

plans in doing so...

BOBBY

I think... this may be our first real

message from Khruschev.

MCCONE

The alternative, Mr. President, is that

this could be a trap.

KENNY

Dangle a settlement, tie us down in

negotiations, we come up short...

MCCONE

Why else would they approach us in this

way?  It's deniable.  The Soviets have

done nothing but lie to us.  This could

be more of the same.

KENNY

That may be why Khruschev's introducing

this guy.  We've been burned by his

usual players in the formal channels, so

he brings in an honest broker.

MCCONE

That may be what they want us to think.

RUSK

The truth is, Mr. President, we don't

even really know whom Fomin speaks for.

It could be Khruschev. It could be some

faction in the Politburo or the KGB

itself.  We just don't know.

BOBBY

By the way, Scali, your activities now

fall under the secrecy codicils of the

National Security Act.  Sorry, no

Pulitzer.

SCALI

Mr. President, we don't have much time.

I'm supposed to meet with him again in

three and a half hours.

THE PRESIDENT

Well, it seems the question of the day

is -- is the offer legitimate?

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

If it is... if it is, then we can't

afford to ignore it.

(beat, to Scali)

John, we'll have instructions for you in

a couple of hours.

GENERAL TAYLOR

Mr. President, I'm afraid we have some

bad news.  We're getting GMAIC estimates

from our latest low-level overflights.

It appears the missiles are two to three

days away from operational status.

MCCONE

So we don't have much time to play out

back-channel communiques.

GENERAL TAYLOR

The quarantine, sir, is not producing

results.  The Chiefs feel it's time you

take another look at our options.

THE PRESIDENT

Kenny, get over to your old stomping

grounds.  Go through everything the FBI

has on Fomin.  I need your best call: is

this guy legit and is he speaking for

Khruschev?  And I need you to tell me by

the time I call you, because right after

I call you, I'm calling Scali with his

instructions.

SHERIDAN

Okay.  So, what we've got is this guy

Alexander Feklisov, aka Alexander Fomin,

declared Consul to the Soviet Embassy,

but in reality the KGB Papa Spy.  An

illustrious tour of duty during the

Great Patriotic War gets him on the

Party fast track, various tours of duty

in KGB, American postings.  He's an

expert on us, and... that's all we've

got on Papa Spy.

KENNY

Who's he talking for?  Is it Khruschev,

or is this more bullshit?

KENNY (CONT'D)

How do you become the KGB top spy in the

United States?

SHERIDAN

Gotta know someone.

KENNY

Politics is politics.  Walter.

(whirling on Agents)

Khruschev is the Moscow Party Boss under

Stalin.  Give me their career

chronologies!

KENNY (CONT'D)

Every time Khruschev moves up, Fomin

does within a year...

(tracing up the list)

Khruschev was the administrator in

charge of preparing Moscow's defenses

during the war.  And Fomin... was here

in the U.S.

YOUNG FBI AGENT

Not at first.

YOUNG FBI AGENT (CONT'D)

He was an engineer stationed outside

Moscow in '42.  Specialized in tank

traps.

KENNY

They know each other.  They're war

buddies.

SHERIDAN

It's thin.  But real life usually is.

KENNY

Hello?

THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)

I've got to move.  What do you have,

Kenny?

KENNY

They know each other!  Khruschev and

Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!

THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)

You're sure...

KENNY

Don't take it to court, but we've got

good circumstantial evidence...

(off Walter's nod)

Walter agrees.  My gut's telling me

Khruschev's turning to a trusted old

friend to carry his message.

THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)

Okay, Ken.  We're going.

SCALI

I am instructed to tell you that the

American Government would respond

favorably to an offer along the lines

you have discussed.  If this solution

were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador

Zorin, he would find a favorable reply

from Ambassador Stevenson.

FOMIN

So I understand you correctly.  If the

missiles in Cuba were dismantled,

returned to the Soviet Union, and a

guarantee was made not to reintroduce

them, the United States would be

prepared to guarantee that it would

never invade Cuba?

SCALI

That is correct.

FOMIN

This is from the Highest Authority?

SCALI

Yes.  From the Highest Authority.  There

are two conditions.  The U.N.

must be allowed to inspect the removal

of the missiles.

FOMIN

And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed

to observe the redeployment of forces

from the American Southeast.

FOMIN (CONT'D)

And the second condition?

SCALI

Time is of the essence.

FOMIN

John.  How much time?

SCALI

48 hours.  In 48 hours there can be no

deals.

SCALI

He left right away.  Got the feeling he

meant business.

RUSK

Mr. President, we're receiving a letter

from Khruschev over at State.

TRANSLATOR

...two...of...us...pull...on...the...

knot...of...war...

KENNY

It's ten pages of sentimental fluff, but

he's saying right here.  He'll remove

the missiles in return for a no-invasion

pledge.  It looks like Fomin's overture

was genuine.

MCCONE

Our early analysis says this was

probably written by Khruschev himself.

It's a first draft, and shows no signs

of being polished by the foreign

ministry.  In fact, it probably hasn't

been approved by the Politburo.  They

wouldn't have let the emotionalism go

by.  The analysts say it was written by

someone under considerable stress.

THE PRESIDENT

Glad to hear we're not alone.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

Well, gentlemen, I wasn't planning on

invading Cuba anyway.  I think we can

live with the terms of this deal.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

Ted, I want you to draft our acceptance.

KENNY

Hi.

HELEN

Hi, O'Donnell.  You look old.

HELEN (CONT'D)

This job's going to kill you.  If I

don't first.

HELEN (CONT'D)

If you're home it means either Jack and

Bobby have finally figured out what a

con man you are and fired you, or --

KENNY

-- we got a back channel communication

from Khruschev this evening feeling us

out about a deal.  He confirmed it just

a little while ago in a letter to the

President.  I think we've won.

HELEN

A thing like this... who could even

think of winning?

BOBBY

Where've you been?  We've been trying to

find you all morning.

KENNY

Helen and I went out for breakfast.

EXCOM's not supposed to convene til

eight.

BOBBY

We just got a second letter from

Khruschev.  The deal's off.

INT. HALL OUTSIDE CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

BOBBY

We're getting everyone together as fast

as we can.

KENNY

What does the letter say?

BOBBY

They want us to take our missiles out of

Turkey along with the no invasion

pledge.  It looks like Fomin was a ploy

after all, and they were just stalling

for time.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

It gets worse.

MCCONE

My specialists are in agreement: this

morning's letter is not Khruschev.  Last

night's letter was.

(beat)

The evidence supports only one

conclusion: there has been a coup, and

Khruschev was replaced overnight.

KENNY

Jesus Christ...

THE PRESIDENT

Dean?

RUSK

It doesn't necessarily mean there's been

a coup.  Khruschev's name is signed to

the letter.

MCNAMARA

Aw, come on, Dean!

RUSK

But at the very least... It does suggest

he's been co-opted by hard line

elements.

MCNAMARA

Which at the end of the day is the same

thing as a coup.  A puppet Khruschev,

and a hard-line Soviet government

pulling the strings.  No deal.  And the

missiles are almost operational.

THE PRESIDENT

You know, the problem we have is that

this is latest offer of theirs will seem

reasonable to everyone.  We remove our

missiles, they remove theirs.

Our Jupiters were scheduled for removal

anyway.  They're obsolete, after all.

RUSK

Mr. President, agreeing to such a trade

would be tantamount to paying ransom.

They'll put a gun to our head again, and

expect us to pay again.

KENNY

We can't sell out one of our friends for

our own safety.  NATO wouldn't trust us

anymore, and they'd be right not to.

THE PRESIDENT

So which one of you geniuses can tell me

how to explain ourselves to the world?

How do we work with them if there's been

a hard-line coup?

GENERAL TAYLOR

Mr. President, there is another

possibility we haven't considered.  This

may not be a coup at all.

GENERAL TAYLOR (CONT'D)

It's possible that the back-channel

overture, last night's letter, and this

letter today, along with everything the

Soviets have said all along, is nothing

more than a lie -- disinformation.

MCNAMARA

Designed to keep us from taking action.

MCNAMARA (CONT'D)

I hate to say it, but if I had to bet,

I'd bet Max is right.  What if they have

no intention of honoring this deal,

either?

Then tomorrow they add another

condition.  Meanwhile, the quarantine

isn't working and they're continuing to

work on the missile sites.

(beat)

I think we have to consider issuing

warning orders for our forces.

LUNDAHL

Mr. President...

LUNDAHL (CONT'D)

This morning's photography is in.  It

appears the Soviets have commenced a

crash program to ready the missiles.

SMASH CUT TO:

LUNDAHL (V.O.)

The first missiles became operational

last night.

LUNDAHL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

We expect they'll all be operational in

36 hours: Monday morning.

SMASH CUT TO:

MCNAMARA

Then we're out of time.  We have to go

in.

LUNDAHL

That may not be as easy as we thought

either.  We've gotten confirmation that

the Soviets have also deployed

battlefield nuclear weapons to Cuba.

LEMAY

FROGS, we call 'em.  Short range

tactical nukes.  It's possible they've

delegated release authority to their

local commanders for use against our

invasion troops.  It'd be standard

doctrine.

(beat)

Our capability to get all the missiles

has eroded during our delay with the

quarantine.  The good news is that for

the moment we know where the FROGS are,

and we can target them, too.  But the

longer we wait, the hard it's going to

get.

THE PRESIDENT

Then we have no choice.

(to  Taylor)

General, issue the warning orders to our

forces.  They will be prepared to

execute the air strikes Monday morning

and the follow-on invasion according to

the schedule thereafter.  I'll need the

official release orders on my desk

Sunday night.

GENERAL TAYLOR

Understood, sir.  We need to step up the

overflights, finalize our pilots' target

folders in order to be able to carry out

the strikes.

THE PRESIDENT

Permission granted.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

Gentlemen, if anybody's got any great

ideas, now's the time...

MAJOR ANDERSON

This is Major Anderson.

INTERCUT CALL TO:

MAJOR ANDERSON (O.S.)

Hello?  Anyone there?

KENNY

Major, my name is Kenneth O'Donnell.

Special Assistant to the President.

KENNY (CONT'D)

Major, a few days ago the President

ordered me to help him keep control of

what's going on out there.  I've been

browbeating pilots, navy guys left and

right to make sure you don't get us here

in Washington into trouble.  But you

know what?  We're pretty damn good at

getting ourselves into trouble.  So

instead of riding your ass, I'm just

going to tell you what's going on, and

let you figure out how best to help us

out up here.

MAJOR ANDERSON

Go ahead, sir.

KENNY

Last night, we looked like we were going

to cut a deal to get us all out of this

mess.  Today, the Soviets are reneging.

We're going to try to salvage the

situation, but a lot of things are going

wrong today.  It's making everyone

nervous, and it will be very hard to

avoid going to war.  Don't get shot

down, Major.  Beyond that, whatever else

you can do to help us, I'd really

appreciate it.

MAJOR ANDERSON

When you're up there at 72,000 feet,

there's a million things that can go

wrong.  Is your oxygen mix right?  Will

your cameras freeze up?  Are you leaving

contrail...

(beat)

Those million things are beyond your

control, mostly... But you know, when

you realize that, there's a kind of

peace.  You don't need to be in control.

You never were in control in the first

place.  If you're a good man, and your

ground crew are good men, it's all you

can ask for.  And with the grace of G-d,

it'll get you through.

MAJOR ANDERSON (CONT'D)

You sound like a good man.  You'll be

all right, Mr. O'Donnell.  We believe in

you guys down here.

(beat)

Thanks for the call.

KENNY

Thank you, Major.

MAJOR ANDERSON

This is flight G3132, requesting

permission for take-off.

TOWER VOICE (O.S.)

G3132, you've got runway one, you are

cleared to proceed to Angels 72.

MAJOR ANDERSON

Roger that.

SMASH CUT TO:

BUNDY (O.S.)

Kenny!

THE PRESIDENT

Does this attack on our plane represent

a definitive, intentional escalation on

the part of the Soviets?

GENERAL TAYLOR

The Soviets are in control of the SAMs.

It's hard to believe with their

centralized command structure that it

could be an accidental launch.

MCCONE

Mr. President, taken with the events of

the past few hours, I believe this

confirms our worst fears.  We're now

dealing with a hard-line Soviet

government, perhaps with Khruschev as a

puppet head, perhaps not.

KENNY

It could be a mistake.

KENNY (CONT'D)

We need to be positive before we react.

BUNDY

A U-2 on a routine air-sampling mission

over Siberia got lost and penetrated

Soviet airspace.  The Soviets scrambled

MIGs in pursuit, thinking it was a

bomber.  It got out okay.  Somebody

forgot to cancel the mission.

THE PRESIDENT

Goddammitt.  There's always some

sonofabitch who doesn't get the word.

All we need is the Soviets thinking

we're bombing them.

(facetious)

Anybody else?

GENERAL TAYLOR

Mr. President, our pilots are in danger.

We must order punitive airstrikes

against the SAM site that shot down

Major Anderson per our rules of

engagement.

THE PRESIDENT

No.  I want confirmation there wasn't

some sort of accident first.

LEMAY

I think that's a good idea, Mr.

President.  It'll be safer for my boys

to get those SAMs on Monday when we get

the rest of the bastards.  I can wait a

day and a half.

THE PRESIDENT

Very well, then.

KEVIN

Hey!  Dad!

KENNY

Hey, sport.  You winning?

KEVIN

Yeah.

KEVIN (CONT'D)

Is everything going to be okay, Dad?

KENNY

Yeah, Kev.  Everything's gonna be fine.

KEVIN

I guess you won't be coming home

tonight.

KENNY

I, uh...

BOBBY

Kenny!  We need to talk.

KENNY

Get back out there, kid.  Remember to

hit 'em hard.

KEVIN

What about you?  Where are you going?

KENNY

Back to work.

KENNY

If we're going to make a deal, we're

going to have to do it fast.  This is

only getting out of control.  The only

reason we're not at war this very minute

is he's been able to stretch, bend and

break his own rules.  He won't be able

to keep it up forever.

BOBBY

And?

KENNY

And Jack wants to trade the missiles in

Turkey.

BOBBY

The Jupiters are obsolete.  They were

supposed to have been dismantled last

summer anyway --

KENNY

-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  I told you

how stupid it was to float the Lippman

article!  But you wouldn't listen to me.

What if there hasn't been a coup at all?

What if it's you two who invited that

second letter by raising the possibility

of a trade?

KENNY (CONT'D)

And if the two of you are thinking this

trade is your ace in the hole, you're so

wrong.  It's a deuce.

KENNY (CONT'D)

And it's not just me who thinks that.

Everyone on this so-called EXCOM is

telling you exactly the same thing: make

the trade, and they're going to force us

into trade after trade until finally

they demand something we won't trade

like Berlin, and we do end up in a war.

(beat)

Not to mention, that long before that

happens, this government will be

politically dead.

BOBBY

All right, so maybe we overestimated how

reasonable this trade would look.  Okay?

You happy?  So now what?

KENNY

So now you've got to talk him out of it.

And then we've got to figure out an

acceptable political solution.

BOBBY

And if there has been a coup and there

is no acceptable political solution?

RUSK

Whatever response we send, it will take

several hours for the wire to be

received by our embassy and delivered to

the Kremlin.  So we're looking at early

tomorrow morning at the earliest before

Khruschev could respond.

BOBBY

He gets it, but he's pissed.

THE PRESIDENT

That's all well and good, but what do we

say to 'em?

SORENSEN

It depends on if we really believe

there's been a coup.

KENNY

I agree.  If there has been a coup, and

there's a hard-line government in power

now, then it doesn't matter what we say.

The end of the day we'll either agree to

their terms, they'll agree to ours, or

we'll go to war.  But what if there

hasn't been a coup?  What if... what if

what is happening is a series of

accidents?

SORENSEN

The second letter is an accident?

KENNY

No.  The letter is an intentional, but

it's having an effect far greater than

its authors intended.

(beat)

What if our Jupiter missiles are just a

last minute haggle to salvage something?

Maybe a bone Khruschev is throwing to

the hard line, not really caring if we

reject it or not?

(beat)

And then these accidents have happened.

BOBBY

Making the second letter and the overall

picture look worse than it really is.

SORENSEN

The Guns of August.

KENNY

Exactly.

(beat)

If they're sane and human like we are,

then maybe we just refuse, and they'll

let it slide, like we've been letting

things slide.

SORENSEN

So we reject the second letter.

KENNY

No.  We don't reject it...

BOBBY

... We accept the first letter and

pretend the second doesn't exist.

INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT

MCCONE

It won't work --

MCCONE (CONT'D)

-- because it's wishful thinking!  It's

the same wishful thinking that blinded

us all these months while the Soviets

were sneaking those missiles in under

our noses!

MCNAMARA

Ignore the second letter, agree to the

conditions of the first...

GENERAL TAYLOR

There's no reason to believe the Soviets

will let it go.

RUSK

Max is right.  Why will they accept it?

MCNAMARA

It can work.  If, IF they believe we'll

hit them.

MCNAMARA (CONT'D)

We've only got time for one more round

of diplomacy.  The first airstrikes

start in less than 36 hours.

RUSK

But we have to make them agree to it.

So how do we do that?

THE PRESIDENT

We give them something.  We tell them

we'll remove the missiles from Turkey

say, six months from now so that there

appears to be no linkage.  We also tell

them if they go public about it, we deny

it and the deal is off.

KENNY

And we do it under the table so we can

disavow any knowledge of it.

MCCONE

It's transparent.  The press'll be all

over it.

KENNY

Six months from now, I'm not going to

care.  Are you?  We'll deal with it.

MCNAMARA

At least it will expose whether

Khruschev has been overthrown.  We'll

know what we're dealing with.

KENNY

And if this is a move to appease the

hard line, then it may just be the bone

he needs to regain control of his own

house.

RUSK

Whoever carries the message has to hit

the nail on the head.  Come across as

too soft, they'll push us.  Too hard,

they'll be cornered and even more

dangerous.

MCCONE

They could pre-empt.

THE PRESIDENT

Bobby.  You know Dobrynin best.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

Ted, you get working on the draft.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

And make sure he knows we have to have

an answer tomorrow.

(beat, final)

Because on Monday we begin military

action against Cuba.

BOBBY

What do you want?  A good-bye kiss?

LIMO DRIVER

Hey, Kenny.

KENNY

Hey, Joe.  Listen, I'll take care of

him.  Go ahead in, grab some coffee.

We'll be back pretty quick.

LIMO DRIVER

You sure?

KENNY

What's the matter with you?  Forget how

to open a car door?

KENNY

Jesus, you rich people.

BOBBY

I don't know if I can do this.

KENNY

There's nobody else I'd rather have

going in there.

KENNY (CONT'D)

Nobody else I'd trust Helen and the

kids' lives to.

BOBBY

Take a left.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

We gave so much to get here.  I don't

know.  Sometimes I think what the hell

did we do it for?

KENNY

Because we knew we could do a better job

than everyone else.

BOBBY

You know... I hate being called the

brilliant one.  The ruthless one.  They

guy who does the dirty work.  The one

everybody's afraid of.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I hate it.  I'm not smart, you know.

And I'm not so ruthless.

KENNY

You're right about the smart part, but

ruthless, well...

BOBBY

Slow down.  Smell that?

KENNY

Smoke.

BOBBY

Just wanted to see for myself.

(beat)

They're burning their documents.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

They think we're going to war.  G-d help

us, Ken.

STAFFER #1

Sir, Ambassador Dobrynin is already

here.  We have him waiting in your

office.

KENNY

I'll whistle up some luck for you.

THE WOMAN

Who are you?

KENNY

The friend.

BOBBY

Ambassador Dobrynin, we are aware that

at this moment your missiles in Cuba are

at the brink of operational readiness...

SMASH CUT TO:

BOBBY (V.O.)

They are a vital threat to my country.

If launched, they would kill 80 million

Americans.

SMASH CUT TO:

BOBBY

My brother, my friends, my countrymen

and I cannot and will not permit those

missiles to become operational.

(beat)

I promise you that.

DOBRYNIN

Then I fear our two nations will go to

war.  And I fear where war will lead us.

BOBBY

If the missiles do not become

operational, if you remove the missiles,

then there will be no war.

(beat)

At this moment, the President is

accepting the terms of Secretary

Khruschev's letter of Friday night.  If

the Soviet Union halts construction

immediately, removes the missiles, and

submits to U.N. inspection, the United

States will pledge to never invade Cuba

or aid others in that enterprise.

DOBRYNIN

If your Jupiter missiles in Turkey were

removed also, such an accommodation

could be reached.

BOBBY

(tired sounding)

The United States cannot agree to such

terms under threat.  Any belief to the

contrary --

(beat)

-- was in error.

DOBRYNIN

You want war...

BOBBY

However, while there can be no quid pro

quo on this issue, the United States can

offer a private assurance.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Our Jupiter missiles in Turkey are

obsolete, and have been scheduled for

withdrawal for some time.  This

withdrawal should be completed within,

say, six months.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Of course, any public disclosure of this

assurance would negate the deal and

produce the most stringent denials from

our government.

DOBRYNIN

This private assurance represents the

word of the Highest Authority?

BOBBY

Yes.

DOBRYNIN

And it can be relayed beyond Comrade

Khruschev's ears to the top circles of

my government

BOBBY

Of course.  Our pledge can be relayed to

any government official Secretary

Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

With the caveat that it is not made

public in any way, shape or form.

(beat)

And we must have an answer tomorrow at

the latest.  I cannot stress this point

enough.

DOBRYNIN

Tomorrow...

BOBBY

Tomorrow...

DOBRYNIN

Then you must excuse me and permit me to

relay the substance of our discussion to

my superiors.

DOBRYNIN (CONT'D)

We have heard stories that some among

your military men wish for war.

(beat)

You are a good man.  Your brother is a

good man.  I assure you there are other

good men.  Let us hope the will of good

men is enough to counter the terrible

strength of this thing which has been

put in motion.

BOBBY (O.S.)

We're out here.

THE PRESIDENT

We were just debating who had it worse,

us or George Washington and his guys.

BOBBY

He didn't have to worry about nuclear

weapons.

THE PRESIDENT

Yeah, but the country didn't even exist

as a country yet.  It was a mess, and he

didn't have a leg to stand on.

KENNY

All he had was his character.

BOBBY

How does a guy get a rep like that?

THE PRESIDENT

Doesn't matter to me.  If I went down in

history like Adams, I'd die happy.  All

they say about him today is --

KENNY

-- he kept the peace.

THE PRESIDENT

You know, we never did control it.  Not

really.  Not like we think.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

But we did our best.  Now it's up to

them.

HELEN

I saw you out there.  You want him to

call you back, need you.

KENNY

No.  I'm glad I'm home.

HELEN

How long do we have?

KENNY

If the sun rises in the morning, it is

only because of men of goodwill.

(beat)

And that's all there is between us and

the Devil.

KENNY

Yeah?

BOBBY (O.S.)

Kenny.  It's over.

RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.)

This is Radio Moscow.  Moscow calling.

RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

The following statement is the text of a

letter from General Secretary Khruschev

to President Kennedy.

RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

...I regard with respect and trust the

statement you made in your message of 27

October 1962 that there would be no

attack, no invasion of Cuba, and not

only the part of the United States, but

also on the part of the Western

Hemisphere, as you said in your same

message.  Then the motives which induced

us to render assistance of such a kind

to Cuba disappear...

RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

...it is for this reason that we have

instructed our officers - these

missiles, as I already informed you are

in the hands of Soviet officers to take

appropriate measures to discontinue

construction, dismantle them, and return

them to the Soviet Union.

THE PRESIDENT

Hey!  Hey.  Okay, that's enough.

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

I don't want any gloating.  This is not

a victory over the Soviets.  It's a

victory with the Soviets.

(beat)

I want everyone to remember that.

BUNDY

We've been talking.  We can play this

big in '64.  It's the foreign policy

trophy we've been waiting.

BUNDY (CONT'D)

I think we can ride it all the way home

next election.  Bet you're way ahead of

us, eh?

MCCONE

We've ordered crash reassessment of our

major geopolitical hotspots.  We've got

a lot of new clout, and we can run the

table on the Soviets.  Middle East,

Southeast Asia...

MCNAMARA

What's wrong, O'Donnell?

KENNY

Don't you understand?

BUNDY

Understand what?

KENNY

The sun came up today.

BUNDY

Yeah.

KENNY

It shouldn't have.  But it did.

MCCONE

We were lucky we were able to keep it

under control.

KENNY

Every day the sun comes up... says

something about us.

BUNDY

Says what, Kenny?

KENNY

Something... amazing.

MCNAMARA

Sure, Ken.  I understand.  Feels good to

win, doesn't it?

BUNDY

See you later, Kenny.

INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY

THE PRESIDENT

Kenny...

THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

...never mind.  See you around, Kenny.

KENNY

You know...

KENNY (CONT'D)

...this was what we're here for.
