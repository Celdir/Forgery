SECOND VOICE

You'll be in my custody! I promise!

WASHINGTON (CONT'D)

Nurse passes)

Mornin', Miss Ratched...

BIG NURSE

Good morning, boys.

MISS PILBOW

Good morning, Miss Ratched. It's a

beautiful day, isn't it?

BIG NURSE

Mean old Monday, Miss Pilbow, mean

(she flips on the

intercom)

Good morning, boys. Rise and shine.

Rise and shine.

BIG NURSE (V.O.)

(through loudspeaker)

Time to get up! Come on now, it's a

beautiful day! Let's not straggle!

Everybody up, up, up!

BIG NURSE

Good morning, Mister Sefelt... Good

love... Good morning, Mister

Harding... Good morning, Mister

Cheswick. Mister Scanlon...

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Oh, Mister Bromden...

(calling out)

Mister Washington!

WASHINGTON

Yes, Miss Ratched?

BIG NURSE

Mister Washington, why don't we get

a good head start on the day by

shaving Mister Bromden and see if

we can't avoid a disturbance.

WASHINGTON

(taking Bromden by the

hand)

Yes, Miss Ratched...

WASHINGTON

(calling as he goes)

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DEPUTY SHERIFF

(to an unseen occupant)

Okay, let's go.

DEPUTY SHERIFF (CONT'D)

Let's move it...

SECOND DEPUTY

Okay, this is it!

SECOND DEPUTY (CONT'D)

(squirming out of

McMurphy's grasp)

Jesus, you're crazy, McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

Yeah, ain't that the truth.

DEPUTY SHERIFF

(to Miss Pilbow)

He's all yours, Miss.

MISS PILBOW

Thank you, Officer...

MCMURPHY

So long, fellas...

MCMURPHY (CONT'D)

Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall

day...

MISS PILBOW

This way, Mister McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

Yes, ma'am...

CUT TO:

MCMURPHY

(as he peels the Band-Aid

off, revealing a scar)

I tell ya, these goons showered me

at the courthouse this morning,

last night at the jail, and I swear

they'd have swabbed my ears out on

the way over if they could've found

the facilities...

MCMURPHY (CONT'D)

(to Nurse Itsu)

Hey, how ya doin', cutie?

NURSE ITSU

Okay. How you doing?

MCMURPHY

Just great!

(calling after her)

See ya around!

MCMURPHY (CONT'D)

(to Nurse Pilbow)

Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my

stay here.

MISS PILBOW

I'm sure you will.

MCMURPHY

(to Nurse Pilbow)

Ya know, I ain't never been in an

institution of psychology before.

MISS PILBOW

Oh...

MCMURPHY

Yeah, I'm here on a ninety-day

observation period. Short-timer,

like they say...

MISS PILBOW

Of course.

(indicating door)

Mister McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

After you, ma'am.

MISS PILBOW

Thank you.

MCMURPHY

(to Washington and Warren

as they step into ward)

Man, there sure is an awful lot of

poontang around here.

SPIVEY

(calling)

Hold it!

SPIVEY (CONT'D)

Good morning, boys.

WASHINGTON AND WARREN

(simultaneously as Spivey

passes into the ward)

Mornin', Doctor Spivey.

SPIVEY

Great day for fishing.

WASHINGTON AND WARREN

(simultaneously)

Yes, sir!

MCMURPHY (O.S.)

Yeah, I was just thinking the same

thing, Doc...

CUT TO:

SPIVEY

(to McMurphy)

Oh, what's that?

MCMURPHY

Why, I'll betcha there must be a

million albacore and tuna running

of the coast right this minute.

SPIVEY

Oh, do you do much fishing?

MCMURPHY

Fish! Hell, Doc, I'd like to have a

nickel for every fish I landed

between Point Conception and the

Alaska coast...

SPIVEY

(to McMurphy)

Is that so?

MCMURPHY

Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay

for just about every season since I

was able to haul my own weight.

SPIVEY

My, my... Ah, who are you?

MCMURPHY

McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.

NURSE PILBOW

Mister McMurphy is a new admission.

SPIVEY

Ah, yes. Well, we must talk soon,

Mister McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

You bet, Doc.

SPIVEY

Good morning, Jim. How are you

feeling?

SEFELT

(approaching and pointing

to his mouth)

Doc, my gungs hurt me.

NURSE PILBOW

This way, Mister McMurphy.

SPIVEY (O.S.)

Have you been taking your Dilantin,

Jim?

SEFELT (O.S.)

Uh-huh...

SPIVEY (O.S.)

Well, we'll send you over to the

dentist and see what he can do.

Okay?

SEFELT (O.S.)

Okay, Doc!

MISS PILBOW

Make yourself at home, Mister

McMurphy...

MCMURPHY

Thank you, ma'am,

MCMURPHY (CONT'D)

Hi.

SEFELT

Hi.

MCMURPHY

How ya doin', buddy?

PATIENT

Poorly, thank you.

MCMURPHY

Oh, yeah? What's ailing ya?

PATIENT

I got the fever.

MCMURPHY

Well, that's too bad...

MCMURPHY (CONT'D)

Yeah, buddy?

TABER

Are you a doctor?

MCMURPHY

No, 'fraid not...

MCMURPHY (CONT'D)

Yeah, buddy?

MARTINI

Can you borrow me a dime?

MCMURPHY

Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta

change...

SCANLON

Got a cigarette?

MCMURPHY

Sure...

MARTINI

Me too! Me too!

MCMURPHY

Hey, how's it look up there, big

boy?

SCANLON

He can't hear you. He's just a deaf

and dumb Indian!

MCMURPHY

That right?

HARDING (O.S.)

Martini, it's your turn!

HARDING (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Martini!

MCMURPHY

(to Martini)

Your buddy is callin' ya.

MCMURPHY

What's troubling ya, buddy?

TABER

I want you to write me a letter to

my brother for a hundred dollars to

bury me.

MCMURPHY

You look pretty healthy to me.

TABER (CONT'D)

I'm the next one.

MCMURPHY

How do ya know that?

TABER (CONT'D)

Because I quit breathing.

MCMURPHY

You're breathin' right now.

MCMURPHY

(crossing to him)

What's that, Pop?

MCMURPHY

(leaning in close)

Can't hear ya, old-timer.

OLD VEGETABLE

Ain't this a pisser?

MCMURPHY

Hell, compared to where I just come

from, this is a country club.

MCMURPHY

Whatcha boys playin'?

BILLY

H-H-Hearts.

MCMURPHY

Shoot! No wonder you don't care

nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.

MCMURPHY

What's your name, buddy?

BILLY

B-B-Billy.

MCMURPHY

Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my

name's McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

What I wanna know is who's the top

loony around here?

BILLY (CONT'D)

Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president

of the P-P-Patients C-Council?

MCMURPHY

Yeah, that'll do for openers!

BILLY (CONT'D)

(to Harding)

H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to

t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr

pr...

HARDING

Does he have an appointment?

CHESWICK

Yeah, do you have an appointment?

MCMURPHY

What for?

CHESWICK

(to Harding)

What for?

HARDING

I'm a busy man!

CHESWICK

(to McMurphy)

He's a busy man!

MCMURPHY

I can wait...

HARDING

(to McMurphy)

What are you doing?

MCMURPHY

I'm seeing what a busy man does.

HARDING

Your turn, Martini!

HARDING (CONT'D)

Martini, throw a card!

HARDING (CONT'D)

No, throw a club!

CHESWICK

Yeah, throw a club!

HARDING

Don't you have any clubs?

MARTINI

No!

HARDING

Let me see your hand!

MARTINI

No!

HARDING

(slamming his cards)

Well, if you gentlemen will excuse

me, I have some pressing matters to

attend to.

MCMURPHY

Yessir, that's why I came to this

establishment for, to bring you

birds fun and entertainment 'round

the gamin' table...

MCMURPHY

Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got

lots of games ahead of us...

BIG NURSE (O.S.)

Mister McMurphy!

MCMURPHY

Yes, ma'am...

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

(handing him his bag)

Will you come with me, please.

MCMURPHY

(rising)

Hold the fort down, will ya,

fellas!

BILLY

Sure, Mack!

BIG NURSE

My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the

head nurse here. You've already met

Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington

and Warren.

MCMURPHY

Yes, ma'am.

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Mister Miller, this is Mister

McMurphy, who'll be staying with

us.

BIG NURSE

We do appreciate the way you have

taken it upon yourself to meet the

other patients.

MCMURPHY

Thank you, ma'am...

BIG NURSE

This is your bed. You may leave

your things in that cabinet.

MCMURPHY

Yes, ma'am...

BIG NURSE

Please use your time to familiarize

yourself with your new home and if

there is anything you need to know,

don't hesitate to ask us.

MCMURPHY

Now that you mention it, I sure

would like to call my aunt up in

Portland and tell 'er where I am so

she can come visit me.

BIG NURSE

All in good time, Mister McMurphy.

All in good time.

MCMURPHY

Yes, ma'am.

BIG NURSE

Good. Now if you'll just go along

with Mister Washington, he'll see

that you're properly oriented.

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Is there anything else?

MCMURPHY

Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss

Ratched. I really am.

BIG NURSE

Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.

MCMURPHY

Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking

for a head nurse.

BIG NURSE

Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy.

Go along.

MCMURPHY

Yes, ma'am.

(to Washington)

Lead the way, Sam.

SPIVEY (V.O.)

What other work have you done?

MCMURPHY

Hell, Doc, I've been everything

from a hoopla man with a two-bit

carny show to a top mechanic and

bull goose catskinner for every

gypo loggin' operation in the

Northwest till the Army taught me

what my natural bent was.

SPIVEY

Oh, what was that?

MCMURPHY

Poker!

SPIVEY

I see.

MCMURPHY

Yeah, but you know how society

persecutes a dedicated man.

SPIVEY (CONT'D)

In what way?

MCMURPHY

They say I'm a habitual hassler.

Like I fight some. Sheeut. They

didn't mind so much when I was a

dumb logger and got into a hassle.

That's a hardworkin' feller blowing

off steam, they say. But if you're

a gambler, all you have to do is

spit slantwise and you're a

goddamned criminal.

SPIVEY

I see...

MCMURPHY

To tell the truth, ever since I

found my natural callin' I done

time in so many small-time jails I

could write a brochure...

SPIVEY

Yes... Ah, do you know why you're

here?

MCMURPHY

Well, ya know, Doc...

(indicating his papers)

Doesn't it say so there?

SPIVEY

(looking over papers)

Well, according to the Warden at

Pendleton, you were a disturbing

influence on others. 'It appears

that there is a potential in him

for instigating a revolt among the

other inmates.'

(looking up at McMurphy)

What do you think of that report?

MCMURPHY

I don't, Doc...

SPIVEY

(goes back to papers)

Arrested on an assault charge five

times...

MCMURPHY

That's correct, Doc ...

SPIVEY

(reading from folder)

The doctor at the prison states:

'Don't overlook the possibility

that this man may be faking

psychosis to escape the drudgery of

the work farm...' What do you say

to that?

MCMURPHY

Doc, what can I tell ya?

SPIVEY

Ah, it seems you have no other

psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?

MCMURPHY

No, this is my first trip, Doc.

SPIVEY

(closes folder and sits

back)

Well, you're here for a ninety-day

observation period, Mister

McMurphy. I'd like you to

understand you are here on a court

order and we are responsible to the

state. So, I'd like your

cooperation!

MCMURPHY

You bet, Doc!

SPIVEY

Good. Good.

BANCINI

I'm tired. Whew. O Lord. Oh, I'm

awful tired...

BIG NURSE

(busy with her papers)

Somebody please see to Mister

Bancini, so we can start the

meeting.

BILLY

T-t-t-take it e-e-easy, P-P-P

Pete...

BANCINI

Awful tired...

BIG NURSE

At the close of Friday's meeting,

we were discussing Mister Harding's

problem, concerning his wife...

(reading from logbook)

Mister Harding stated that his wife

made him uneasy because she drew

stares from men on the street. Is

that correct, Mister Harding?

HARDING

Yes, that's perfectly correct.

BIG NURSE

(reading)

He also thinks he may have given

her reason to seek sexual attention

elsewhere, but he didn't say how.

He has been heard to say to his

wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever

want to see you again. You've

betrayed me.'

(she closes book)

So. Does anyone care to touch upon

this further?

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Mister McMurphy, this ward is a

democratic community run by the

patients and their votes, so you

should feel at ease in your new

surroundings to the extent you can

freely discuss emotional problems

in front of the patients and staff.

However, the cardinal rule, and I

must emphasize this: Everyone keeps

their seat during the meeting!

MCMURPHY

Yeah, well, it just pains me

somethin' awful to see a full

growed man sloshing around in his

own water...

BIG NURSE

Yes... We were discussing Mister

Harding's problem with his wife.

Now, who will start?

(no response)

Billy.

BILLY

M-m-m-ma'am?

BIG NURSE

Would you like to start?

BILLY

N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.

BIG NURSE

Mister Sefelt?

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Mister Fredrickson?

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Mister Taber?

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Mister Martini?

MARTINI

No!

BIG NURSE

Mister Scanlon?

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Mister Cheswick?

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Am I to take it that there isn't a

man among you who has an opinion

concerning this matter?

(no response; she focuses

in on Harding)

Mister Harding, you've stated on

more than one occasion that you

suspected your wife of seeing other

men.

HARDING

Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.

BIG NURSE

But you have no proof.

HARDING

No, Miss Ratched...

BIG NURSE

And yet you suspect her.

HARDING

Yes, that is correct.

BIG NURSE

Why?

HARDING

I can only speculate as to the

reasons why.

BIG NURSE

Have you ever speculated, Mister

Harding, that you are impatient

with your wife because she does not

meet your mental requirements?

HARDING

Miss Ratched. Given all the

conditions of that sublime

relationship, coupled with the

subsequent annihilation of all that

I held to be sacred, mentally,

physically and emotionally, the

only thing that I can speculate on,

at this late date, is how I will

justify the very existence of my

life, with or without my dear wife.

SEFELT

What's he talkin' about?

TABER

Yeah, Harding, why don't you

knockoff the bullshit and get to

the point.

HARDING

The point is, I will carry on until

I fully understand what the

function of that relationship is

regardless of form or content.

BIG NURSE

Yes, Billy?

BILLY

I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how

anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man

who t-t-t-talks the way he does.

TABER

Yeah, Harding, you're so fuckin'

dumb I can't believe it.

HARDING

That's a matter of opinion.

SEFELT

Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe

anyway?

FREDRICKSON

Through the ass.

HARDING

(smarting)

Is that your sense of humor or are

you trying to say something?

FREDRICKSON

(innocence itself)

Now what would I be trying to say?

HARDING

I don't know. I don't know, but it

makes me feel very peculiar when

you throw in something like that.

FREDRICKSON

Peculiar?

SEFELT

Why?

TABER

Yeah, why?

SCANLON

Yeah, tell us why.

HARDING

I hesitate to go on.

BIG NURSE

No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's

get it all out in the open...

HARDING

I mean, the other day you made an

allusion to my wife and the

possible sexual problems we might

be having. I know that to be the

case, but the way in which you

broached it, if that's your idea of

teaching me something...

HARDING (CONT'D)

(his voice rising as he

goes on)

... or making me aware of a

condition in my life, then I say,

categorically speaking, the hell

with you, Taber!

I don't have to justify the

condition of my life to you or any

of you. No matter what I will carry

on until I fully understand what

that function is regardless of the

form or content. Regardless of the

fact we must try to understand the

function of our capacity to obtain,

to personify the condition, the

condition of our existence, our

existence...

TABER

You know what, Harding? I think

you're some kind of morbid asshole

or something. You've been talking

about your wife evere since I can

remember. You know, she's on your

mind and blah, blah, blah and on

and on and when are you going to

wise up and turn her loose!

FREDRICKSON

Yeah, wise up, Harding.

SEFELT

Yeah, turn her loose!

ACUTES

(start pouring it on)

Yeah, who do you think you are

anyway?... He thinks he's God

Almighty... He's a snob... He's a

schmuck... Dumbbell... Creep...

Cretin... Idiot... Get rid of

him... Ship him upstairs...

RUCKLY

(chiming in)

Ffffffuck da wife...

BANCINI

(wagging his head)

Tired... Awful tired...

ACUTES

(not letting up)

Zap him... Give 'im lobotomy... Cut

his nuts off... He doesn't have

any... Fag... Pervert.

BANCINI

(in a strong angry voice)

I'm tired!

BIG NURSE

Somebody see to Mister Bancini.

BANCINI

Tired. Tired. Oh God, I'm tired...

WASHINGTON

You a good boy, Mistah Bancini...

BANCINI

You see... it's a lotta baloney...

It's all a lotta baloney...

NURSE PILBOW

Yes, yes, Mister Bancini, now if

you'll just be calm...

BANCINI

That's all it is, just a lotta

baloney. Ya see, I can't help it,

can't...

NURSE PILBOW

(working her way around

Bancini)

Yes, I know, I know...

BANCINI

... don't ya see. I was born dead.

Not you. You wasn't born dead.

Ahhh, it's been so hard...

(starts going over,

slowly; sighing and

crying)

Tired... I'm tired... aw-ful

tired...

MARTINI

(as he throws ball)

Catch it! Catch it!

WASHINGTON

Martini, there ain't nobody there,

ya dumb goon! Go get the ball!

MARTINI

No!

MARTINI (CONT'D)

I get it! I get it!

MCMURPHY

Well, say, buddy, is that the usual

pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py

shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a

peckin' party?

HARDING

A pecking party?

MCMURPHY

That's right, buddy. And you want

to know who pecks the first peck?

HARDING AND CHESWICK

Who? Who?

MCMURPHY

Ah, come off it! It's that Big

Nurse, that's who...

HARDING

It's as simple as that. You've been

on our ward six hours and have

already simplified the work of

Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in

one grand analogy: it's a pecking

party.

MCMURPHY

I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or

Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm

talkin' about is that crummy

meeting and what that nurse did to

you!

HARDING

Did to me?

MCMURPHY

Did to you and all the rest of you

guys.

BILLY

Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh

wh-what she c-c-can do to us!

MCMURPHY

What did I see 'cept a grown man

gettin' whipped so bad he can't

laugh anymore.

FREDRICKSON

It's the questions she asks.

MCMURPHY

Tell 'er to go straight to hell!

HARDING

Miss Ratched is a competent

psychiatric nurse, not some, some

kind of monster pecking out our

eyes!

MCMURPHY

(as calm as blue waters)

She ain't peckin' at your eyes,

buddy.

MCMURPHY

She's peckin' at your balls, buddy,

at your ever-lovin' balls.

SEFELT

That kind of behavior will get you

a P.A. rating, my friend.

MCMURPHY

P.A. What the hell is that?

SEFELT

Potential assaultive.

FREDRICKSON

Which gets you shipped up to

Disturbed for a nice little zap

job.

MCMURPHY

Huh?

HARDING

Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend.

Five cents' worth of electricity

and you are out of everybody's

hair.

MCMURPHY

Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!

HARDING (CONT'D)

And if you persist in your ways,

they can always ship you over to

Medical Surgery.

MCMURPHY

What for?

HARDING (CONT'D)

Lobotomy!

MCMURPHY

Lobotomy?

HARDING (CONT'D)

(pointing to lobotomy

case)

That!

MCMURPHY

(to Harding)

Is that your sense of humor or are

you tryin' to say somethin'?

HARDING

Now, what would I be trying to say?

SCANLON

Gimme the ball!

MARTINI

No. Me! Me!

WASHINGTON (O.S.)

Pass the ball, McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

(turning to Martini)

Pass it to me, Martini.

MCMURPHY

C'mon, I'll give it back!

MCMURPHY

Atta boy, Martini.

MCMURPHY

(encouraging them)

Back and forth, that's it. Shoot,

man, we'll be takin' on the New

York Knicks before we're through...

MCMURPHY (V.O)

Hey-ya, hey-ya, come on, come on,

I'm waitin' on you suckers, you hit

or you sit...

SEFELT

Hit me!

MCMURPHY

Hit, you say? Well well well and

with a king up, the boy wants a

hit. Whadaya know.

So comin' at you and too bad, a

little lady for the lad and he's

over the wall and down the road, up

the hill and dropped his load.

SEFELT

Boogered!

MCMURPHY

'Kay, place your bets.

MARTINI

(holding up a cigarette)

What's this?

MCMURPHY

That's a dime, Martini.

MARTINI (CONT'D)

Bet a nickel!

MCMURPHY

(to Cheswick)

Whadaya bet, Cheswick?

CHESWICK

She won't give me any more

cigarettes!

MCMURPHY

That okay. I'll take your marker.

How many ya want?

CHESWICK (CONT'D)

Lend me twenty.

MCMURPHY

(checking the board)

'Kay, all bets are down, let's

wheel 'em an' deal 'em.

MCMURPHY

Big king... little deuce... another

king... a lovely lady... big ten...

and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya

say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?

MARTINI

Hit me.

MCMURPHY

(hits with a picture)

That's twenty up, Martini.

(turning to TV, he shouts

across room)

Hey, Taber, who's pitching the

opening game?

MARTINI (CONT'D)

Hit me!

MCMURPHY

Wait a minute, Martini, I can't

hear a thing.

(turning back to Taber)

What?

TABER

(shouting back)

Koufax against Ford!

MISS PILBOW (V.O.)

(over loudspeaker)

Medication time! Medication time!

Medication!

MARTINI

(simultaneously with

Pilbow)

Hit me!

MCMURPHY

Pardon me miss, but would you mind

turning...

NURSE PILBOW

(scared out of her wits)

Stay back! Patients aren't allowed

to enter the... Oh, stay back!

MCMURPHY

All I'm askin' is...

NURSE PILBOW (CONT'D)

Oh, stay back, I'm a Catholic!

BIG NURSE

Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't

allowed in here.

MCMURPHY

Sorry, ma'am.

MCMURPHY

(to Big Nurse)

Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you

somethin'?

BIG NURSE

(politely)

Yes, Mister McMurphy?

MCMURPHY

How 'bout turning off that music

for a while so a man can hear

himself think?

BIG NURSE

(pleasantly)

That music is for everyone, Mister

McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

(confidentially)

Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down

a bit so a man don't have to shout!

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

(aware of his physical

proximity)

Mister McMurphy, there are old men

here who couldn't hear the music at

all if it were lower. That music is

all they have, and I wish you

wouldn't lean against the glass

there, your hands are staining the

window.

MCMURPHY

Sorry, ma'am... Sorry 'bout that...

MCMURPHY

Sorry to have bothered you.

BIG NURSE

Not at all, Mister McMurphy...

NURSE PILBOW

Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

(turning back, he examines

the contents of the cup)

What's the horse pill for, honey?

NURSE PILBOW

It's just medication, Mister

McMurphy, good for you. Now down it

goes...

MCMURPHY

Look, miss, I don't like swallowing

something without knowing what it

is!

NURSE PILBOW

(stepping back a little)

Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...

MCMURPHY

I'm not upset. All I wanna know,

for the lovva Jesus...

BIG NURSE

That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if

Mister McMurphy does not wish to

take his medication orally, he

may...

MCMURPHY

No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it

goes.

HARDING

Why didn't you tell her to go to

hell, lover boy?

TABER

Yeah, whattsa matter, Mack, she too

much for ya?

MCMURPHY

You boys seem to think you've got a

champ in there, huh?

HARDING

I don't see you scoring any points,

buddy. And you're just the man for

the job, right?

MCMURPHY

Hell, I couldn't get it up over old

hatchet-face if ya paid me!

HARDING (CONT'D)

She's not all that homely, Mister

McMurphy. In fact, she must have

been a rather beautiful young lady.

MCMURPHY (V.O.)

(through intercom)

Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's

just an icy-hearted over-the-hump

gal who never got enough of the old

wham-bam to straighten 'er out...

Okay, who wants a card?

MARTINI (V.O.)

(through intercom)

Me. Hit me!

TURKLE

Le's get back to bed, Mistah

Bromden...

MCMURPHY

(whispering)

Chief? I wanna ask ya somethin'.

(sings)

Oh, does the spearmint lose its

flavor on the bedpost overnight?

When you chew it in the morning,

will it be too hard to bite? This

question's got me goin', won't

somebody set me right; does the

spearmint lose its flavor on the

bedpost overnight?

MCMURPHY

Here ya go, Chief...

BIG NURSE (V.O.)

(through loudspeaker)

Good morning, boys. Rise and shine.

Rise and shine.

BIG NURSE (V.O.)

(through loudspeaker)

Time to got up! Come on now, it's a

beautiful day! Let's not straggle!

Everybody up, up, up!

WASHINGTON

Le's go, Chief. Le's go get

ourselves all nice and clean...

(to McMurphy)

You too, Mistah Mack-Murphy!

MCMURPHY

(looking in the drawer)

What the...

(looking around)

Who the fuck stole my cigarettes!

BIG NURSE

Good morning, Mister Sefelt, are

your teeth any better?... Good

morning, Mister Fredrickson... Good

morning, Mister Harding;

my, my, you've been biting your

fingernails again...

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Mister McMurphy, patients are not

permitted to run around in towels.

MCMURPHY

I wanna report a robbery!

BIG NURSE

On this ward?

MCMURPHY

Yeah, some creep stole my

cigarettes!

BIG NURSE

Oh, I had them removed.

MCMURPHY

What for?

BIG NURSE

Patients are rationed to one pack

of cigarettes a day.

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

(calling out)

Mister Washington!

WASHINGTON

Yes, Miss Ratched?

BIG NURSE

Please see to Mister Bromden.

WASHINGTON

(taking Bromden by the

hand)

Yes, Miss Ratched...

BIG NURSE

Now you boys hurry along and wash

up for breakfast...

(to McMurphy)

You too, Mister McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

Well, say. How 'bout springing a

pack of cigarettes loose?

BIG NURSE

After breakfast, Mister McMurphy,

after breakfast.

MCMURPHY

You sure run a tight-assed ship

'round here, don't ya!

BIG NURSE

Yes. Now run along like a good boy

and see that you wash up properly.

MCMURPHY

'Kay, let's go brush our teeth,

fellas...

MCMURPHY

Oh, Lulu had a baby,

His name was Sunny Jim,

She put 'im in a piss pot,

To teach 'im how to swim.

Oh, he swam to the bottom,

He swam to the top,

Lulu got excited,

An' pulled 'im by his...

Cock-tail ginger-ale,

Five cents a glass,

An' if ya don't like it

Ya can shove it up your...

Ask me no more questions,

I'll tell ya no more lies.

MCMURPHY (O.S.)

What's wrong with you guys?

MCMURPHY

Why, if I'd have known how soft

this place was gonna be, I'd have

arranged for my transfer sooner...

(holding up his orange

juice)

Look at this here, real orange

juice!

(slugging it down)

Hooee, that's good. Why, you

couldn't pay me to leave this

place!

(slaps his belly)

All this place lacks is a couple of

sweet gals to liven things up...

MCMURPHY

Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.

WASHINGTON

Nobody leaves here till seven

thirty.

MCMURPHY

Don't know if I can hold it that

long, Sam.

WASHINGTON (CONT'D)

Tha's your problem.

MCMURPHY

(confidentially)

Who do you like in the opening

game, Sam?

WASHINGTON (CONT'D)

Huh?

MCMURPHY

(turning away)

Asshole.

CHESWICK (V.O.)

I wanna know about my cigarettes!

BIG NURSE

Sit down, Mister Cheswick.

CHESWTCK

(not sitting)

No, I ain't no kid to have my

cigarettes keep from me like

cookies! Ain't that right, Mack!

(McMurphy doesn't respond)

Mack???

BIG NURSE

Sit down, Mister Cheswick!

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

(to Cheswick)

You should have thought about that

before you gambled all your

cigarettes away. Is that clear?

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Mister Cheswick, is that clear!

CHESWICK

Yeah...

BIG NURSE

Good...

(opens her book)

Now, as I recall, we were making

quite a bit of headway, last time,

with Mister Harding's problem. So,

does anyone care to begin?

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Yes, Mister McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

Right... I've been givin' some

serious consideration to what you

told me about the democratic

something of this therapeutic

community of ours, an' I got a few

things I wanna get off my chest,

before we get back to Harding's

problem.

BIG NURSE

Certainly, Mister McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

Right!

MCMURPHY

'Kay... Item one... I've been

thinkin' 'bout the age problem we

got on this ward. You know, the

young an' old livin' together, an'

I was thinkin' what a great thing

it would be if the music was turned

up louder. Louder so the old fellas

could hear better...

MCMURPHY

But then I got to thinkin', the

music is so loud already, it makes

it difficult for the young fellas

to hold a decent conversation...

MCMURPHY

Well, I was turnin' this dilemma

over in my head, when I happened to

hit on that old tub room out there,

an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I

said, that place would make a great

second day room. A sort of game

room for the young fellas. Whadaya

think, Doc?

SPIVEY

It is worth considering... Miss

Ratched?

BIG NURSE

The point is well taken, Doctor,

but do we have the necessary

personnel to cover a second day

room?

SPIVEY

Well, since it will be largely the

Chronics who remain here, one aide

and one nurse should easily be able

to handle any situation that might

occur.

(he turns to the patients)

What do you think, men, is it

workable?

CHESWICK

Right, Doc. It's workable.

SPIVEY

Fine!

BIG NURSE

Good. Good. Yes, yes, I think we

should give it a trial period. So!

May we get back to Mister Harding's

problem...

(she sees McMurphy's hand

up)

Yes, Mister McMurphy?

MCMURPHY

I'm not finished yet.

BIG NURSE

Go on...

MCMURPHY

(looking at his list)

'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and

listen carefully to me, you ding-a

lings. Tomorrow is the opening game

of the World Series an' what I want

is to take a vote on switchin' the

group meetin' to later on in the

day, so we can watch the ballgame.

BIG NURSE

Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!

MCMURPHY

Yeah?

BIG NURSE

Please understand, the schedule has

been set up for a delicately

balanced reason that would be

thrown into turmoil by a switch of

routines.

MCMURPHY

The hell with the schedule, you can

get back to the schedule next week

when the series is over. What I

want is a vote on it right now!

CHESWICK

I second the motion!

MCMURPHY

Atta boy, Cheswick!

BIG NURSE

Very well! All those in favor,

please raise your hands.

MCMURPHY

(raising his hand)

Okay, raise your hands.

MCMURPHY

Come on', what is this crap? Who

wants to watch the World Series?

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

(politely)

I count only two, including you,

Mister McMurphy. Certainly not

enough to change ward policy.

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Yes. Now was there anything else

you wanted to discuss, Mister

McMurphy?

MCMURPHY

No way.

CHESWICK

No way.

BIG NURSE

(checking her watch)

Then I suggest we turn our

attention back to Mister Harding's

problem. Would anybody care to

begin?

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Yes, Mister Harding?

HARDING

Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since

our last meeting I have been

reflecting, quite seriously, on the

nature of my problem. Naturally,

I'm referring to the capacity to

obtain the necessary results in

order to obtain... No, no. To

personify the very existence of

that relationship regardless of the

function...

(he stops, chews his lip,

then continues)

Regardless of the function, we will

confront the question of... Yes.

Yes. The question of...

Existence... Relationship...

Function... Confront... Yes,

confronting us in the moment of

deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis

of our souls. Of our souls, which I

am trying to fully understand the

problem... the problem. Not to shut

ourselves off, but somehow...

Somehow to understand fully our

capacity... to obtain... to

personify... the question...

existence depends... depends on the

question... to reflect... to

reflect...

HARDING (CONT'D)

To reflect...

MARTINI (V.O.)

Hold it a minute. What's a man need

to buy thum hotels?

MCMURPHY

You need four houses on every lot

of the same color, Martini. Now

let's go, for Christsakes.

MARTINI

Hold it a minute.

CHESWICK

Let's go, for Christsakes...

MCMURPHY

It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.

MCMURPHY

Snake eyes! Hoooeee, that puts you

on my Marvin Gardens, which means

you owe me three hundred and fifty

dollars.

MARTINI

What's thum other things? Hold it a

minute. What's thum other things

all over the board?

CHESWICK

(to Martini)

How can a man concentrate with you

sitting there hallucinating a mile

a minute...

MCMURPHY

You just come on with that three

fifty and Martini will take care of

himself... Your dice, Scanlon.

SCANLON

Gimme those dice. I'll blow this

board to pieces. Here we go...

(throws the dice)

Lebenty leben, count me over

eleven, Martini...

SCANLON (CONT'D)

Not that one, you crazy bastard,

that's my house...

MCMURPHY

Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I

got enough troubles without you

guys messin' around... can't depend

on nobody.

BILLY

(from the next table)

Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here

a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b

b-be here long after this Wo-Wo

World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh,

what's the use anyway...

MCMURPHY

What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you

birds some good just to get a

little exercise lifting your arms

to vote!

HARDING

A baseball game isn't worth the

risk, my friend.

MCMURPHY

It is to me! An' if I hafta bust

way outta this place to see it, I

will!

CHESWICK

Right!

FREDRICKSON

Oh, yeah?

MCMURPHY

Yeah!

SEFELT

Big man!

MCMURPHY

Yeah, how much you wanna bet?

SEFELT

On what?

MCMURPHY

That me an' my buddy, Cheswick,

we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin'

the ballgame while you suckers are

sittin' around this goddamn

nursery!

HARDING

And how do you propose to

accomplish that little feat, my

friend?

MCMURPHY

That's between me an' myself. So

why don't you boys just shove off.

I got some planning to do.

SEFELT

Maybe he'll just show Miss Ratched

his big thing an' she'll open the

door for him.

MCMURPHY

Maybe I'll just use that thick

skull of yours as a batterin' ram,

Sefelt.

SEFELT (CONT'D)

Why, my head would just squash like

an eggplant, McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

You think it's funny, huh?

TABER

Yeah, you don't know how to get

outta this place!

MCMURPHY

Put your money where your mouth is,

Taber.

TABER (CONT'D)

Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony,

McMurphy!

MCMURPHY

(rising and turning on the

others, who back off)

You want me to show ya! You want me

to show ya how!

TABER (CONT'D)

Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!

MCMURPHY

All right!

MCMURPHY

With this thing! I'm gonna put this

thing right through the window,

that's how!

HARDING

You mean you're going to try to

pick that thing up and shove it

through the window?

MCMURPHY

You're fuckin' A-right, I am!

HARDING (CONT'D)

With your own two hands?

MCMURPHY

You heard me the first time!

TABER

I'll bet a buck you don't do it!

MCMURPHY

You're on!

BILLY

M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l

lift that thing!

MCMURPHY

Stand aside, son. Any more takers?

SEFELT

I'll bet a dollar.

FREDRICKSON

Me, too...

MCMURPHY

Right!

MARTINI

A nickel.

SCANLON

A dime.

MCMURPHY

Okay. Who else?

HARDING

Twenty-five dollars.

MCMURPHY

(knows he's taking a bad

bet)

Okay, Harding, you're on.

HARDING

Okay, sucker.

MCMURPHY

Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you

guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!

HARDING

Giving up?

MCMURPHY

Just warmin' up.

MCMURPHY

But I tried. Goddammit, I sure as

hell did that much. Didn't I?

BILLY

M-M-Mack...

BILLY (CONT'D)

M-M-Mack, I-I-I'm sorry!

HARDING

Leave him alone, he's pouting.

BILLY

Y-Y-Y-You leave him alone!

MCMURPHY

That's okay, kid...

BILLY

Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m

mad?

MCMURPHY

No, kid, it was my own stupidity,

that's what pissed me off.

BILLY

O-o-o-oh...

MCMURPHY

What we're gonna have to do is pull

this ballclub together for our next

play. 'Kay!

BILLY

'K-k-kay, Mack!

WASHINGTON'S POV

Way down the hall, the Group

Meeting is SEEN in progress.

BIG NURSE

Try, Billy, try...

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Was it your idea to visit her on

Sunday?

BILLY

Y-y-y-yes...

BIG NURSE

Tell us about it...

BILLY

I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S

Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch

church and br-br-brought her s-s

some flowers, and I s-s-said, I

said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh

muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl

broke out l-l-laughing.

BIG NURSE

What was it about her that

disturbed you so, Billy?

BILLY

(rubbing scars on his

wrist)

I was in luh-love with her.

BIG NURSE

Billy, were you afraid of her, or

of her love?

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

That was the first time you

attempted to commit suicide, wasn't

it?

(no response)

You must try to talk about it,

Billy.

MCMURPHY

Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want

to talk, so get off his back an'

let's get on to some new business.

BIG NURSE

Mister McMurphy, the purpose of

this meeting is therapy. Group

therapy.

MCMURPHY

Yeah, yeah, the hell with that

crap! The World Series is goin' on

right' now an' that's therapy also!

BIG NURSE

Let me pose a question to the

group: do any of you feel that

Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing

his personal desires on you too

much?

MCMURPHY

What the hell does that have to do

with it? This is an important event

and I want a vote on it!

CHESWICK

Yeah, let's vote on it!

BIG NURSE

Will one more vote satisfy you?

MCMURPHY

Yeah, it'll satisfy me.

BIG NURSE

Very well. What is it you're

proposing, Mister McMurphy?

MCMURPHY

I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin'

the ballgame!

BIG NURSE

(to the patients)

A vote is before the group.

MCMURPHY

Okay, I wanna see the hands. I

wanna see which of you birds has

any guts.

BIG NURSE

Everyone in favor of changing the

schedule raise his hand.

MCMURPHY

That's it! We made it!

BIG NURSE

I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count

only eight.

MCMURPHY

So do I!

BIG NURSE

But there are eighteen patients on

the ward, Mister McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

(the light dawning)

You mean to tell me you're gonna

count those old birds over there?

BIG NURSE

I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you

must have a majority to change ward

policy.

MCMURPHY

Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...

BILLY

B-But, M-M-Miss R-Ratched, y-you n

never c-c-counted th-their votes

before!

BIG NURSE

(losing ground)

You mean you don't want their votes

to count, Billy!

BILLY

I-I-I...

MCMURPHY

Well, screw that noise!

BIG NURSE

Sit down, Mister McMurphy!

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

I want you to turn the television

off and return to your place!

MCMURPHY

Hoo-wee! Man, all I need me now is

a can of beer and a red-hot.

BIG NURSE

Sit down, Mister Cheswick.

CHESWICK

Mack...

BIG NURSE (V.O.)

(over loudspeaker)

I want you men to return to your

proper places. The group meeting is

not over!

MCMURPHY

(jumping up and shouting

at the blank TV screen)

A hit! It's a hit! He's rounding

first, heading for second. Here

comes the throw. He's sliding...

and... he's safe! He's safe!

(McMurphy whistles and

claps his hands)

Hoo-wee! Whatta game! Whatta game!

Come on, Koufax! Strike 'em out!

BIG NURSE (V.O.)

(over loudspeaker)

Mister McMurphy, you are

deliberately violating the

rules!...

MCMURPHY

He's into his wind-up. Here comes

the pitch. Strike on the inside

corner!

BIG NURSE (V.O.)

(over loudspeaker)

You men remain seated!

MCMURPHY

(focusing in on TV screen)

He's into his wind-up. Here's the

next pitch... and it's a hit! It's

a hit!

MARTINI

(jumping up and down)

I saw thum! I saw thum!

SCANLON

Me, too! Me, too!

SEFELT

Yes, I see it! I see it!

MCMURPHY

(on his feet, shouting)

Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!

ACUTES

Ya-hoo!

It's a hit!

A triple!

It's a home run!

A double!

He's out!

Whadaya blind?

He's safe by a mile!

(AD LIB)

BIG NURSE (V.O.)

(over loudspeaker)

You boys, stop this and go to your

assignments! Mister McMurphy, I

want you to set an example...

MCMURPHY

'Kay, it's two outs, bases loaded

as Koufax steps up to the mound...

Checks the runners... goes into his

wind-up... Here comes the three-two

pitch... And it's a fly ball into

deep center. Mantle is going back.

He's going back! Back! His back is

up against the wall... and... he

catches it! He catches it!

BIG NURSE'S VOICE

(over loudspeaker)

You men stop this! Mister

Washington! Miller! Warren!

SPIVEY

How are you feeling?

MCMURPHY

Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think

I might've put on a couple of

pounds since I got here.

SPIVEY

Good, good, and how are you getting

along on the ward?

MCMURPHY

Come on, Doc, you know as well as I

do what's been comin' down in that

loony bin.

SPIVEY

Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that

you're a disturbing influence on

the other patients.

MCMURPHY

Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm

disturbing is that old nurse and

her fixed ways. That's all.

SPIVEY

Yes, that may be so, but in making

a careful study of your past

record, along with your behavior

since you arrived here, my feeling

is that you are not mentally ill

and it is going to be my

recommendation that you be returned

to Pendleton where they are better

equipped to handle your case.

MCMURPHY

Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.

SPIVEY

I'm afraid not.

MCMURPHY

Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my

ass in a sling, don't she!

SPIVEY

No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that

we cannot offer you the guidance

and assistance that you would

receive at Pendleton.

MCMURPHY

Guidance and assistance! That's

insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.

SPIVEY

I'm sorry, but I can't keep you

here.

MCMURPHY

When?

SPIVEY

We'll let you know.

MCMURPHY

(with great physical and

vocal emphasis throughout

entire scene)

Okay, Chief. This is your spot! I

don't want you to move from this

spot! Never!... 'Kay, now, take the

ball! Raise your hands, like

this...

MCMURPHY

That's good! That's a good boy,

Chief! Now jump and put it in!

HARDING

He can't hear you!

MCMURPHY

I know, goddammit! You don't have

ta tell me that!

HARDING

So why are you talking to him?

MCMURPHY

I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin'

to myself! It helps me think!

HARDING

It doesn't help him.

MCMURPHY

Well, it doesn't hurt him either!

(turning to Bromden)

Does it, Chief!

(no response)

See, it doesn't hurt him.

(to Bromden)

Jump! An' put it in!

HARDING

Well, I think you're just confusing

him...

MCMURPHY

Ha! Did ya see that!

(calling to Cheswick on

the sidelines)

Hey, Cheswick!

CHESWICK

Yeah, Mack?

MCMURPHY

Come here!

CHESWICK

Yeah, Mack?

MCMURPHY

Let me get on your shoulders.

CHESWICK

Sure, Mack...

MCMURPHY

'Kay, wheel me around to the

basket... 'Kay, easy, easy. Hold

it! 'Kay, now.

(he sees Bromden has

walked away)

Hey, Chief, come back!

MCMURPHY

Cheswick, go get 'im!

MCMURPHY

Now, wheel me to the basket.

MCMURPHY

(pointing to the floor)

Wait here, Chief.

(more to himself as he

starts down hall)

Heh, heh, I'll show 'em who's

crazy.

MCMURPHY

Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!

CHESWICK

(waking up)

Yeah, Mack, what is it?

MCMURPHY

I'm leaving. Goodbye!

CHESWICK

(sitting up)

Where ya goin', Mac?

MCMURPHY

Shhh...

MCMURPHY

(waking Billy)

Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and

say goodbye to your ol' buddy.

BILLY

(waking up)

W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?

MCMURPHY

BILLY

Wh-wh-wh-wh...

MCMURPHY

Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!

MARTINI

(waking up)

Yeah, Mac?

MCMURPHY

Bye-bye.

MCMURPHY

Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!

SCANLON

(waking up)

Yeah, what's up?

MCMURPHY

Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.

FREDRICKSON

(waking up)

What? What?

MCMURPHY

So long, Freddy. Don't take any

wooden nickles.

FREDRICKSON

(sitting up)

What?

MCMURPHY

Shhh...

MCMURPHY

Bye-bye, pussy cat.

MCMURPHY

(waking Taber)

Up an' at 'em, Taber.

TABER

(waking up)

What's going on?

MCMURPHY

Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.

MCMURPHY

Hey, Hard-on. Wake up, Dumbo.

MCMURPHY (CONT'D)

Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.

HARDING

What for?

MCMURPHY

I'm busting outta this place.

HARDING

That's nice. Send me a post card.

MCMURPHY

(turning to the others who

have gathered around)

So long suckers.

BILLY

Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?

CHESWICK

How ya gettin' out, Mac?

MCMURPHY

Shhh... That's for me to know an'

you to find out.

TABER

Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!

MCMURPHY

Oh, yeah?

TABER

Yeah!

MCMURPHY

How much ya wanna bet?

TABER (CONT'D)

Ten bucks.

MCMURPHY

You're on.

(to the others)

Let's go! An' keep it quiet.

BILLY

Wh-wh-what's d-d-down th-there, M-M

Mac?

TABER

Where's it go?

MCMURPHY

Out. It's the way out. So just keep

it in your minds if ya ever wanna

make use of it.

TABER

I don't believe it...

FREDRICKSON

Neither do I...

SEFELT

Me too...

MARTINI

I wanna see it...

SCANLON

Me too! Me too!

BILLY

Y-y-yeah, p-p-prove it, M-M-Mac!

CHESWICK

DISSOLVE TO:

MCMURPHY

bus)

This is it!

MCMURPHY

Come on in an' warm up. You can put

some of that gear on to keep warm.

An' there's beer an' Coke in the

cooler an' some food over here...

MCMURPHY

Come on, don't be shy now, you're

among friends.

MCMURPHY

Why don't one of you boys help ol'

Chief there get warmed up?

CHESWICK

MCMURPHY

(looking out the window)

Come here a minute, Cheswick. You,

too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys,

come over here, I wanna show you

somethin'.

MARTINI

Oh, look at the pretty boat.

MCMURPHY (V.O.)

Yeah, did you ever see a boat like

that? Why, I'll bet you could go

all the way to Hawaii in that boat!

Tahiti... the Philippines...

Tibet...

DISSOLVE TO:

BILLY

H-H-Help!

MCMURPHY

Ease up on the star drag, keep the

tie up, up and work hell outta that

fella.

SCANLON

My turn.

MARTINI

(hanging onto the pole)

No.

MCMURPHY

Up, I told you! Keep that tip up...

up! You had you one big silver

there.

SEFELT (O.S.)

Oh, my God! I see something!

SCANLON

Jesus God...

MARTINI

What is it?

FREDRICKSON

We'll never get that on the boat.

BILLY

(calling)

M-M-Mack! M-M-Mack!

MCMURPHY

What is it, kid?

BILLY

C-C-Come here and l-look at th

this!

MCMURPHY

He's a big flounder. Could weigh

two, three hundred. You got to lift

him in with a winch.

FREDRICKSON

Does that mean we have to cut him

loose?

MCMURPHY

Like hell we will! We got the

muscle standing right here. All we

need is a couple gaffin' hooks and

some rope.

BILLY

I-I-I'll get them.

MARTINI

Me, too.

SCANLON

Me, too.

MCMURPHY

Steady does it, Sefelt!

DISSOLVE TO:

VOICE

(over bull horn)

All right! Stand to! Stand to!

SPIVEY

(to Big Nurse)

Here they are, Miss Ratched. Safe

and sound!

BIG NURSE

Good. Well, boys, did you enjoy

yourselves?

FREDRICKSON

(to Sefelt)

Show her the one you caught, Jim.

BIG NURSE

My, my...

MCMURPHY

Yeah, ya should've come along with

us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a

little sun on your cheeks and maybe

caught a fish or two.

BIG NURSE

Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to

take these men out with you!

MCMURPHY

(loudly)

Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't

it!

BIG NURSE

No, it was irresponsible!

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

(respectfully)

That's quite a catch, Jim. Whaat

are you going to do with it?

MARTINI

(crossing to McMurphy)

Gimme a cigarette!

SEFELT

I thought I might donate it to the

mess hall.

MCMURPHY

(reaches in his pocket; he

has none)

I don't have any.

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

That's an excellent idea. Now, why

don't you boys place your fish on

the gurney and we'll see to it that

everyone enjoys a fresh fish

dinner.

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Thank you, boys. Now if you'll just

go along with Mister Washington to

the showers, supper is in half an

hour.

MARTINI

(to Harding)

Gimme a cigarette!

HARDING

No!

MARTINI

Why not?

HARDING

I'm not running a charity ward...

MARTINI

(holding his hands up;

empty)

All gone! All gone! Don't hit!

Don't hit!

MCMURPHY

I'm sure sorry, ma'am. Gawd, but I

am. That window glass was so clean

I didn't even see it...

MCMURPHY

You guys want cigarettes! Here's

the goddamn cigarettes!

WASHINGTON

Warren! Miller!

AIDE

(pointing to a bench)

Wait over there...

AIDE (CONT'D)

gently)

Come on, Joey... this isn't going

to hurt you... good for you... make

you feel better...

BROMDEN

Thank you.

MCMURPHY

Say it again.

BROMDEN

Thank you.

MCMURPHY

Say... God Bless America!

BROMDEN

God Bless America.

MCMURPHY

(slapping his thigh)

Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch!

Does anybody else know?

BROMDEN

No.

MCMURPHY

Shit! This is too much!

(his mind going a mile a

minute)

Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust

outta this place an' make it all

the way to Canada before they know

what bit 'em.

BROMDEN

Ca-na-da...

MCMURPHY

Ya like that, Chief, huh?

BROMDEN

Yeah...

MCMURPHY

Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time

the rest of the world got a gander

at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down

the boulevard, stopping just long

enough for virgins... Oh, man, I

tell you, I tell you, you'll have

women trippin' you and beating you

to the floor...

BROMDEN

Ca-na-da...

MCMURPHY

Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never

talk! Remember, this is just

between you an' me. Do ya

understand?

NURSE ITSU (O.S.)

Mister McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

(recognizing a long-lost

friend)

Hey, how ya doin'?

NURSE ITSU

Fine, thank you.

(offering pills)

Here, please take these.

MCMURPHY

What are they?

NURSE ITSU

To help you relax... please...

NURSE ITSU (CONT'D)

Please take off your shoes.

NURSE ITSU (CONT'D)

Please follow me.

MCMURPHY

(rising, thumbs up)

You an' me, Chief.

MCMURPHY

(to Itsu)

You know, I never got your name.

NURSE ITSU

(stopping at the door)

Miss Itsu.

(indicating the room)

In here, please.

MCMURPHY

You comin' in to hold my hand?

NURSE ITSU

No...

MCMURPHY

Yeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu.

MCMURPHY

Yeah...

MCMURPHY

(as he enters)

Hi...

MCMURPHY

You boys can take a cigarette break

now...

DOCTOR

That's all right, Mister McMurphy,

just climb on the bed and lie

down...

MCMURPHY

Whatever you say, Doc...

DOCTOR

(to McMurphy)

This won't hurt you at all...

MCMURPHY

Uh, uh...

MCMURPHY

What's that for?

NURSE

Conductant.

MCMURPHY

(smiling up at her)

Surely, goodness and mercy will

follow this, eh, honey?

DOCTOR

(holding a mouthpiece)

Please, put this in your mouth...

SLOW FADE OUT

TO:

BIG NURSE

(to Sefelt)

It's been brought to my attention

that you're giving Mister

Fredrickson your medication, aren't

you, Mister Sefelt?

SEFELT

It's the Dilantin that makes my

gums soft!

BIG NURSE

Now, Jim, you must be honest with

yourself.

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Yes, Mister Fredrickson?

FREDRICKSON

I wanna know why the dorm has to be

locked in the daytime and on

weekends?

TABER

Yeah, why can't a fellow even have

the weekends to himself?

CHESWICK

(standing up)

Yeah, whadabout our cigarettes?

BIG NURSE

Sit down, Mister Cheswick, and wait

your turn!

BIG NURSE (CONT'D)

If the dorms were left open, you

would just return to bed after

breakfast...

FREDRICKSON

So what? Is it a mortal sin? I

mean, normal people get to sleep

late on weekends...

BIG NURSE

With few exceptions, time spent in

the company of others is

therapeutic, while every minute

spent brooding alone only increases

separation.

CHESWICK

(jumping up as he sees

McMurphy)

Mack!

McMURPHY

Hey, hey, you ding-a-lings, you

creeps, you goons...

MCMURPHY

I got ten thousand watts and hot to

trot. First woman takes me on is

gonna light up like a pinball

machine an' pay off in silver

dollars...

BILLY

H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?

MCMURPHY

Just fine, Billy boy, just fine.

Full of piss an' vinegar! They

checked my plugs and cleaned my

points...

BIG NURSE

Mister McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

(turning)

Yes, ma'am?

BIG NURSE

Welcome back.

MCMURPHY

Thank you, ma'am.

BIG NURSE

I hope everything is settled.

MCMURPHY

Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy

dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar

out of an aide for two weeks! Hi

ya, Doc!

BIG NURSE

Good. Why don't you join us?

MCMURPHY

Why, thank you, ma'am...

(he gets a seat and sits

heavily)

Whew. Man, I tell you, that place

up there is somethin' else!

(pulling it together)

Well, ya boys been practicin' up

(no response)

I figured as much...

BILLY

W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never

BILLY

HARDING

MCMURPHY

(coming out of it)

Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan...

Yeah...

PHOTOGRAPHER

(wrapping it up)

Thank you, boys.

MCMURPHY

Miss Ratched, would you please save

a space for my aunt? She's comin'

down from Portland.

BIG NURSE

Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with

pleasure.

MCMURPHY

Thank you, ma'am...

MCMURPHY

Gotta go now, ma'am...

BIG NURSE

Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.

MCMURPHY

Thank you, ma'am.

MCMURPHY

SPIVEY

MCMURPHY

(taking the ball out)

Come on, wake up, you ding-a-lings.

The game is on.

MCMURPHY

Pass the ball, Harding...

(no pass)

Don't hang onto it...

(no response)

Pass it, goddammit!

MCMURPHY

Harding, here, over here!

MCMURPHY

(to Harding)

HARDING

Time out!

CANDY

his arms)

Terrific, baby, terrific!

(to Rose)

Hi ya doin', Rose?

ROSE

Okay, Mack!

(looking around)

Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an

insane asylum or ain't we?

MCMURPHY

(to Candy)

How's your ass been holdin' up,

honey?

MCMURPHY

Come on, girls, we're holding up

the game!

MCMURPHY

Miss Ratched, this is my Aunt Candy

and her friend Rose...

MCMURPHY

Miss Ratched was kind enough to

save you ladies a seat...

MCMURPHY

Talk to ya at half time!

CANDY

(calling after him)

Sock it to 'em, kid!

ROSE

(taking in the players)

Are they all crazies?

BIG NURSE

No.

ROSE

Oh, just those guys dressed in

white?

BIG NURSE

No, miss, it's the other way

around.

ROSE

Well, you could've fooled me.

MCMURPHY

Whadaya doin', there's no one

MARTINI

I saw 'em! I saw 'em.

HARDING (O.S.)

(shouting)

Mack, get back here!

MARTINI

Gimme the ball!

(holding the ball)

Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you

MCMURPHY

(sees Harding still on

court)

Hold it! Time out!

(to Harding)

I said Harding out!

HARDING

MCMURPHY

I said out!

HARDING

(casting a quick look at

his wife)

No!

MCMURPHY

I'm the coach!

HARDING

I just started!

MCMURPHY

You can come back later!

HARDING

MCMURPHY

(looking for another victim)

SCANLON

MCMURPHY

MARTINI

BILLY

I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...

MCMURPHY

Good boy, thank you, Billy.

HARDING

(off to the side of

McMurphy)

McMurphy, pass the ball!

MCMURPHY

(as he cuts past Harding)

Harding, pass the ball!

CANDY

(at the top of her lungs)

Atta boy, Mack!

(to Big Nurse)

What's he in for?

BIG NURSE

Who?

CANDY

Mack!

BIG NURSE

Miss, it's a complicated case. It

would take too long to explain.

CANDY

Yeah, well, he looks like hell!

BIG NURSE

(to Billy)

Billy, it's not polite to stare!

BILLY

(to Candy)

Miss!

BILLY (CONT'D)

Hi!

CANDY

(giving him a big smile)

Hi...

MCMURPHY

MCMURPHY

Run, Chief, run!

SPIVEY

line up at the foul line)

We got your black ass now,

WASHINGTON

TURKLE

(approaching)

What you boys doin' up at this

ungodly time o' the night?

MCMURPHY

Prayin', brother. Prayin'.

TURKLE

Well, you boys finish it up an'

climb back into your beds. 'Kay?

MCMURPHY

'Kay...

MCMURPHY

There they are, Chief!

MCMURPHY

Where are they goin'?

TURKLE

I thought I told you boys to go to

bed!

MCMURPHY

(flagging the girls)

Our prayers have been answered,

Turkle! Our prayers have been

answered!

TURKLE

Oh yeah...

MCMURPHY

I tell ya, there's an angel of

mercy standing out there, Turkle.

TURKLE

Hallelujah, brother, now get back

in bed!

MCMURPHY

Come an' see.

TURKLE

(crossing to McMurphy)

That angel of mercy, he ain't a

she, is he?

MCMURPHY

You's better believe it, brother!

TURKLE

Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe

ya!

MCMURPHY

(taking Turkle aside;

holds up $20 bill)

Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty

bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece

of that angel cake?

TURKLE

(taking the $20 and

reaching for his keys)

Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on

my knees.

CANDY AND ROSE

(both slightly tipsy)

Hiya, Mack.

MCMURPHY

Hiya, girls...

TURKLE

Shhh...

CANDY

Whew! Made it!

MCMURPHY

(embracing Candy)

Man, you look good 'nough to eat!

CANDY

Yeah, well you look like hell

ROSE (O.S.)

Hey, pssst! Whadda 'bout me?

TURKLE

Hey, Mac! Gimme a hand, will ya!

ROSE

(giggling; loud)

Whew! Hiya, boys!

TURKLE

Shhh... let's move it away from the

window...

MCMURPHY

(arms open)

Come here, sugar...

TURKLE

What happened?

ROSE

(backing into Turkle)

What's that?

TURKLE

(mystified)

What?

ROSE

(pointing at Bromden)

That!

TURKLE

Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be

afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief

Bromden. That's all...

ROSE

Is he one of the loonies?

MCMURPHY

He's a patient, Rose...

ROSE

Oh, yeah...

MCMURPHY

Yeah...

ROSE

(approaching Bromden

tentatively)

Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'?

Like it in here?

MCMURPHY

He can't hear you, Rose. He's just

a big deaf an' dumb indian...

CANDY

Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!

ROSE

(looking around)

What? Where?

CANDY

In there.

ROSE

Wow! They're so quiet.

TURKLE

They're sleeping, Miss. They're

sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down

so we don't disturb their sleep.

ROSE

Are they dangerous when they're

awake?

TURKLE

Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies.

These are nice guys. Nice guys.

CANDY

What's that smell?

TURKLE

What smell?

CANDY

Smells weird. Smells like

pneumonia.

TURKLE

Ammonia, Miss...

ROSE

Smells like piss. Is this real,

Candy? Is this really real? I mean

we are in an insane asylum, an' I

wanna know how we got ourselves

into this scene.

TURKLE

Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...

ROSE

(to McMurphy)

Who is he?

MCMURPHY

(passing the bottle to

Turkle)

He's in charge.

ROSE

Are you a doctor?

TURKLE

(passing the bottle to

Rose)

Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.

ROSE

(drinking and passing the

bottle to Candy)

Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'.

I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this

boyfriend, Chuck.

(to McMurphy)

Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember,

Chuck.

MCMURPHY

Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.

ROSE

Well, listen to this. He got mad at

me one day. Boy, did he get mad at

me. He took the light bulb, ya

know. I thought he was going to

cram it right up me, ya know. But

he ate it. He ate the whole fucking

light bulb.

(to Turkle)

Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me!

Is he crazy?

TURKLE

Well, Miss... I would say... I

would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.

ROSE

I thought so.

TURKLE

Is he in an asylum?

ROSE

He's dead.

TURKLE

Oh, I see. He was a very sick man.

Very sick.

ROSE

That's what I told his mother. And

she said I was crazy. Her son ate

the whole fucking light bulb and

she said I was crazy.

TURKLE

I don't know anything about that,

Miss. I would have to examine you

first...

ROSE

You ol' fucker!

TURKLE

Well, I'm running a risk by letting

you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin'

a risk of gettin' my black ass

fired. If you understand what I

mean...

MCMURPHY

Sure, she understands what you

mean. She's not dumb. Why do you

think Rose came to visit us? Rose

is very interested in hospitals and

hospital facilities. Aren't you,

Rose?

ROSE

What?

TURKLE

I'll be very glad to show you

around, Miss...

MCMURPHY

Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle.

Why don't ya take Rose on a little

tour of our facilities...

ROSE

Wait a minute...

CANDY

It's okay, Rose. You can go with

him.

ROSE

Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind,

I'll decide on my own date!

CANDY

Shit, Rose! What's there to decide?

There's only four of us.

ROSE

Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at

least twenty guys in there. Let's

wake 'em up and get this party on

the road.

TURKLE

Now, Miss. What do you want with

twenty zombies when you got a

twenty gun salute looking you right

in the face.

ROSE

Oh, yeah...

TURKLE

You better believe it, you sweet

little thing. You better believe

it...

ROSE

Don't you sweet talk me you ol'

spook, you!

TURKLE

Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now,

let's just you an' me trip on down

that hall.

CANDY

Go with him, Rose. Go with him.

ROSE

Well, okay, but I just want to look

at the facilities. That's all.

TURKLE

That's all I'm going to show you.

MCMURPHY

'Kay, lets get under way.

MCMURPHY

Down the ol' hatch, Chief.

MCMURPHY (V.O.)

(through loudspeaker; very

low, ominous, drawn out)

Who knows what evil lurks in the

hearts of men...
