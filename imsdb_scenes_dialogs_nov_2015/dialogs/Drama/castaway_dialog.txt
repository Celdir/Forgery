CAST AWAY

by

William Broyles

THIRD DRAFT

March 13, 1998

MARFA, TEXAS, 1993.

RUSSIAN WOMAN (O.S.)

(accented English)

It's pretty.  Who is it from?

AMERICAN MAN (O.S.)

My wife.

CHUCK

My guess is we're talking fuel filters

here, Fernando.  The gas is dirty, these

jitneys get in the mountains, their

engines cut out.

FERNANDO

That could lose us half an hour.

CHUCK

Easy.  Each way.

CHUCK

So it finally turned up...

CHUCK

I'll catch the sweep tonight.

CHUCK

It took this test package thirty-two

hours to get from Seattle to St.

Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand

miles.  And then it took forty-one hours

to get from our warehouse in St.

Petersburg to here, a distance of,

what --

ALEKSEI

Six kilometers.  Four miles.

CHUCK

So how are we going to get this place

shaped up?

CHUCK

There's only one way.  We have to work

together.  Every one of us depends on

everyone else.  If one package is late,

we are all late.  If one truck misses the

deadline, we all miss the deadline.

Let's start by taking a look around.

CHUCK

Here, this table is too far from the

wall.  Packages can slip down...like...

(pulls out a package from

behind a table)

...this.

CHUCK

What could be in here?  Let's say one of

you sent it.  Could be the closing papers

on your dacha, could be a toy for your

grandson's birthday, could be a kidney to

keep your mother alive.  I don't think

you want your mother's kidney to end up

behind a table.

TRANSLATOR

He says they have been very busy.  It is

hard to get good employees.  He is sure

you understand.

ALEKSEI

Phone call.  Malaysia.

CHUCK

Kamal?  Right.  I'm getting them.

CHUCK

I'm looking at the blueprints of K.L.

right now.  The belts are too small for

the sorters.  Yeah, sometimes you never

see what's right in front of your face.

Look, it's --

CHUCK

(to a loader)

Hold it!  Hazardous material needs its

own container!

(back on the phone)

-- three in the afternoon there, right?

That gives you five hours until the sweep

comes through.  Do the sort by hand

tonight, then put in a new feeder belt,

say a twenty-four incher.  Yes, overtime

is authorized.

CHUCK

I'm going out on every route, I'm going

to work every job here, until I know

enough to help you.  That's it.

ALEKSEI

It's bad.

CHUCK

Worse than Warsaw.

ALEKSEI

Nobody remembers that.

CHUCK

The failures they remember.  It's the

successes they forget.

CHUCK

You sorted your packages before you left.

None of the other drivers did.

TRANSLATOR

He says he wants to be organized.  Do

packages in order.

CHUCK

So how come the other drivers haven't

left yet?

TRANSLATOR

He says -- he is a very rude fellow --

CHUCK

Tell me exactly what he said.

TRANSLATOR

He says why don't his farts smell sweet?

TRANSLATOR

He says that's just the way it is.

CHUCK

Lev -- it's Lev, right?  Listen, this is

FedEx.  We don't have to accept the way

it is.

CHUCK

No, keep trying.  A circuit's bound to

open up.

CHUCK

(to himself)

Those damn Northern Lights.

CHUCK

Hello?  Great.  Try it.

KELLY (V.O.)

This is Kelly, leave me a message and

I'll call you back soon as I can.

CHUCK

Kelly, damn, look, this is Chuck.  I'm

going to be a little late.  Well, more

than a little.  I had to go to Russia.

Couldn't be helped.  Could you call and

cancel the trip?  Look, we'll sail the

Keys in March.  It's better then anyway.

I'll be back before Christmas.  I

promise.  I think.  I mean, I will.  I,

uh --

CHUCK

I miss you.

LEV

We've never got all the trucks in on

time.  Never.

CHUCK

Only one still left?

LEV

Route six.

ALEKSEI

If we don't send it now we may miss the

connection in Paris.

CHUCK

(to Aleksei)

Give it five minutes.

CHUCK

Let's go.

CHUCK

That's Bermuda.  Bermuda is in the

Memphis thru container.  No, Azores is

Europe.

CHUCK

The Paris container.  Africa too.  Japan

goes to Memphis.

LEV

We did it.  All of them.

CHUCK

Great job, everyone.  Remember, work

together.  We are like a hand...

LEV

One finger, weak.  All fingers working

together, strong.

CHUCK

You got it.

CHUCK

I absolutely, positively, have to get to

Memphis overnight.

JACK

Can't help you.  Try UPS.

CHUCK

Jack -- gotta be something wrong with our

physicals, you keep getting certified to

fly.  Gwen, aren't you worried?

GWEN

Terrified.

CHUCK

We're on time, right?

JACK

On time, Chuck.

CHUCK

Little present from the emerging

republics.

CHUCK

What connects the world?  What makes it

one?

(they ignore him)

We do.  FedEx.

GWEN

You are such a lifer.

STAN

What do you expect, from the guy who

stole a kid's bicycle when his truck

broke down?

CHUCK

Borrowed.  I borrowed it.

STAN

How'd it go?

CHUCK

Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one

for a change.

STAN

I had to bump your plane last night.

CHUCK

You what?

STAN

It was fifteen minutes late.

CHUCK

I checked the weather, you had the jet

stream, you could have made it up.

STAN

But I might not have.

CHUCK

Jesus.  I got it working... You have no

idea how hard it was... They're finally a

team...

STAN

I'm touched.

CHUCK

You fucked us over.

STAN

The point of FedEx, as I understand it,

is to make the damn connection.

CHUCK

I was making a point.

STAN

What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let

Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody

down the line clean up your mess?

CHUCK

Every person counts, every package

counts, that's my point.

STAN

You know what your problem is?  You just

see the packages in front of you.  You

don't see the big picture.

CHUCK

Baloney.  I do see the damn "big

picture."

STAN

I didn't know we had sailboats.

CHUCK

It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.

STAN

For all those vacation days you got

coming.

CHUCK

And never take.

STAN

Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I

couldn't risk being late into Memphis.

CHUCK

Forget it.

STAN

You know General McLelland, he wouldn't

attack unless he had everything just

right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him

and said, General, if you're not going to

use my army, could I borrow it for a

while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant

just said, let's go.

CHUCK

I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with

Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay

attention.

STAN

We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've

got to be bold.  You always want all your

ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100

percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49.

Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the

dice.

CHUCK

That's why you're a gambling man.

STAN

That's why I'm running foreign and you're

not.  That's why you're not married and I

am.

CHUCK

For the third time.

STAN

Take the plunge, admit your mistakes,

move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx,

that's women, that's life.

CHUCK

You are one sick fucker.

STAN

I'm trying to help you here.  There's

Warsaw, there's this --

CHUCK

This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the

truck then minutes, it's not that big a

deal.

STAN

Look, that kids' bike, that's a guy

who'll do what it takes to get there on

time.  Live up to your legend, that's all

I'm saying.

CHUCK

A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95

percent in a month.

STAN

Ninety five percent?  Just give me the

money now.

CHUCK

Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?

STAN

We're on.

CHUCK

Let's go off-line.

CHUCK

Two Valium...

STAN

And the Stones.  Got to be.

STAN

Chuck.  Wake up Chuck.

STAN

You gotta do your own delivery from here.

CHUCK

Damn thing.

CHUCK

Sorry, I'm really sorry.

CHUCK

You seen Kelly Frears?

GUY

Xerox machine.

KELLY

Sonofabitch!

CHUCK

Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.

KELLY

Chuck!  You're back!

KELLY

Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium

again?

CHUCK

You smell like formaldehyde.

KELLY

My last chapter's in there, and the damn

machine's jammed.

CHUCK

Let's take a look.

KELLY

How was Russia?

CHUCK

Cold.

KELLY

Don't overwhelm me with details, you know

how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?

CHUCK

I thought I did.

CHUCK

Got to follow the paper path here.

KELLY

Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia

didn't turn out well?

CHUCK

Used to you could fix these yourself.

KELLY

Chuck.

CHUCK

What do you want me to say?  That I

thought I'd done a great job but it all

turned to shit?  That I might as well

have gone sailing for all the good I did?

KELLY

Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.

KELLY

You don't even know what time it is.

What day it is.

CHUCK

And I can't fix this damn machine.

KELLY

Come on.

KELLY

We're on the deck of the ketch, the air's

soft, the water's clear as crystal...

CHUCK

That's carcinogenic.

KELLY

We're covered with suntan lotion and

sweat.  Our skin is so hot, it's

glowing...

KELLY

We could take a swim.

CHUCK

On the other hand we could not take a

swim...

BECCA

So why was Milan late, Colin?

COLIN

One of the race horses coming from

Ireland got colic and had to be off-

loaded in Brussels.  That put the Jumbo

15, six hours late into Charles De

Gaulle.  Customs had difficulty locating

the dutiable items...

BECCA

Stan, can we get P&A down to work with

Milan customs?

STAN

We're already on it.

BECCA

Good.  And let's look at our live animal

policy.  I don't think the income stream

justifies delaying IP product, especially

at Christmas.

BECCA

Stand by, Benson, we're still wrapping up

foreign.

BECCA

Chuck, thanks for joining us.  Status?

CHUCK

Becca, as you know St. Petersburg was

consistently running late by six to ten

hours -- sometimes a full day or more.  I

replaced the station manager.  We

identified inefficiencies and worked out

a quality improvement plan I believe can

be met.

MAYNARD

You replaced the station manager with a

driver.  A local with no knowledge of our

systems.

BECCA

Shouldn't you have brought in someone

from Memphis?  Russia is priority one.

MAYNARD

James Pottinger is available.

STAN

He's a numbers cruncher.  Chuck's done

all the right things here...

CHUCK

Jim's a terrific financial man, no

question.  But we can't always parachute

in from Memphis.  We've got to build up

our local staff.

MAYNARD

We've got to improve foreign on-time,

that's what we've got to do.  If this new

guy's so good, how come the very first

plane he sent missed the connection in

Paris?

CHUCK

We're building a new team here.  We got

every package on the truck for the first

time ever.  Success is the best teacher.

MAYNARD

I don't call missing the plane a success.

KELLY

Merry Christmas eve.

CHUCK

Not if you work for FedEx.

KELLY

You break four million packages last

night?

CHUCK

Four four.  A record.

KELLY

You don't seem too happy about it.

CHUCK

Ah, the staff meeting could have gone

better.

KELLY

Let me guess, Russia came up?

CHUCK

One of those packages just moved.

KELLY

Merry Christmas.

CHUCK

Hey, look at you.

KELLY

I figure, if we could take care of a

puppy, we could, you know, take care

of --

CHUCK

He is a cute thing.

KELLY

He's your cute thing.

CHUCK

I can't even keep fish alive.

KELLY

A puppy's got a little more personality

than a fish.

CHUCK

And for you --

KELLY

So do good things come in large packages?

CHUCK

You know, for when you travel.

KELLY

For when I travel?

KELLY

You should have got me something that

shows you want us to be together, not

apart.

CHUCK

I wasn't sending a message.  I though

you'd like it.

KELLY

You should have got me a ring.

CHUCK

I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow

down at the Hub.

KELLY

A ring.  I wanted a ring.

CHUCK

You did?

CHUCK

Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But

I have to go.

KELLY

You can't go now.

CHUCK

I have to.

KELLY

You want to.

CHUCK

What should we call him?  Or is it her?

How about Jango?

KELLY

This isn't working out.

CHUCK

We're a little emotional here.  It's

Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.

KELLY

"We're" not over-reacting.

CHUCK

Could you watch Jango?

KELLY

No.

CHUCK

I can't take him to work.

CHUCK

We'll talk about it when I come back.

It'll all be fine.  Really.

CHUCK

Kelly?  Kelly?

CHUCK

There.  There.  Easy now.

CHUCK

Kelly?

MOM

What happened to your pants?

CHUCK

Mom, meet Jango.

AMANDA

Dinner's ready.

MOM

Chuck?

CHUCK

Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts,

which we are about to receive, from thou

bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.

ROGER

Let's eat.

MARY

How's Kelly?

CHUCK

Great.

ROGER

Thought you were going to bring her.

CHUCK

So did I.

MOM

It seemed like she had such a good time

last time.

CHUCK

It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.

MARY

Jennifer's still down at the post office.

And she's still got that crush on you.

ROGER

And she's still got those --

MARY

Roger.

ROGER

You should have stuck around.

CHUCK

Look, I help take care of the place.  You

got my check, didn't you Mom?

MOM

That new roof, that's your doing.

ROGER

You're just allergic to farming, that's

what dad said.  Can't stand to be alone.

Can't stand to be in one place.  Can't

stand the sight of...blood.

MARY

Roger's going to put chickens in here.

CHUCK

Come on Roger, this is dad all over

again.  You already did beefalo,

chinchillas, and what was that, ostrich?

They chased Mom around the yard, sprained

her hip.

MOM

It wasn't that bad, dear.

MARY

You can't make a living out of this

place.  We tried.

CHUCK

But chickens?

ROGER

Sixty three pounds consumed per capita,

up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to

pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No

religious taboos.  You don't see your

Hindus and your Muslims boycotting

poultry.

CHUCK

True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere,

so far as I know.

MOM

Roger's working at Tyson's now.

CHUCK

Really?

ROGER

Come on down to the plant.  It's state of

the art.  We're doing for chickens what

FedEx did for the delivery business.

CHUCK

Just don't count 'em before they hatch.

ROGER

I'll try to remember that.

MOM

Dessert.

MOM

Speaking of hatching, I could sure use

some more grandchildren.

CHUCK

Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real

strawberries growing outside, we've got

real cream.

MOM

Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring

out the store bought.

CHUCK

Maybe I should take a few days off.

Roger's working now, you could use some

help around here...

MOM

Don't you even think about it.

CHUCK

The place is falling apart.

MOM

I'm doing fine.

CHUCK

Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.

MOM

There's settled folks, and there's

nomads.  You're just not a settled folk.

You never belonged here.

CHUCK

Come on inside, Mom.  You've had a long

day.

CHUCK

I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.

LESLIE

And how was your Christmas?

CHUCK

Terrific.  Yours?

CHUCK

And get me in to the dentist.  My tooth's

acting up.

STAN

Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten

in operations.

CHUCK

Right.

(to Leslie)

Get me everything on Indonesia, New

Guinea, all the way to Australia.

CHUCK

Kamal?  Kamal?  Can you hear us?

DICK

Can't we get this working?

TECHNICIAN

Trying.

CHUCK

Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear

us?

VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)

Kamal is not here.

CHUCK

Who is this?  Where is Kamal?

VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)

It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.

CHUCK

What's going on down there?

VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)

Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.

CHUCK

Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?

STAN

We got Telex, e-mail?

TECHNICIAN

Sure.  Just not getting any answers.

CHUCK

When's the next Jumbo?

LESLIE

The regular flight is scheduled for oh

three hundred tomorrow.

CHUCK

Anything else?

LESLIE

There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an

hour, goes through Sydney.

STAN

Maybe you should get your ducks lined up

first.

CHUCK

Call Operations.  Get me on it.

KELLY

That's your dog.

CHUCK

It's our dog.  It belongs to us.

KELLY

There isn't any us.

CHUCK

Yes there is.

KELLY

I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a

little carried away.

CHUCK

No, it was great.  Maybe a little

overkill --

KELLY

I burned the Christmas tree.

KELLY

Why didn't you come over, get mad at me,

tell me what a stupid bitch I was.

CHUCK

I guess I hadn't thought through how I

felt.

KELLY

What, you were going to come over the

next day all calm and say, Kelly that

really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're

mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.

CHUCK

Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get

back.

KELLY

Don't even start.

KELLY

Get back?  From where?

CHUCK

Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.

KELLY

Give him to me.

KELLY

Chuck, you're breaking my heart.

CHUCK

A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?

KELLY

Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango

to the frogs.

CHUCK

Al -- gotta be something wrong with our

physicals, you keep getting certified to

fly.  John, aren't you worried?

JOHN

I disconnected his controls.  He only

thinks he's flying.

CHUCK

You're on your way home, Al?

AL

Right.  Down home, down under.

CHUCK

We're on time, right?

AL

On time, Chuck.

DISSOLVE TO:

CONTROLLER

Jumbo 14 is overdue in Sector K.

SUPERVISOR

Where are they?

CONTROLLER 2

Somewhere east of Port Moresby.  Guam is

getting a signal but no location.  Maybe

the GPS is out.

CONTROLLER

Guam, I need a fix on Jumbo 14.

CHUCK

All right, guys.  I'm here.  Check the

GPS, get moving.

CHUCK

Where the fuck are you?

CHUCK

Sonofabitch.

CHUCK

That was smart, really smart.

CHUCK

Ahhh.

CHUCK

Maybe the GPS malfunctioned.  That Korean

airliner did.

CHUCK

Okay, do the math.  Maybe they know where

you are within, say 500 miles.  That's a

circle with an area of, uh, pi r squared.

So, uh, 250,000 times three point one

four, that's about 800,000 square miles.

Three times the size of Texas.

CHUCK

They could use a satellite.

CHUCK

Say each satellite photo is 30 feet

square, that's uh...fuck it...billions

and billions of photos.

CHUCK

Aw, someone will come.

CHUCK

What the hell?

CHUCK

Oh Jesus.

CHUCK

I'm so sorry, Al.  So sorry.

CHUCK

Got to cover Al up.

CHUCK

Got to cover Al up.

CHUCK

We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow

submarine...

CHUCK

Yellow submarine.  We all live in a

yellow submarine...

CHUCK

Bad idea.  Should have saved some.

CHUCK

Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did

you enjoy the play?

CHUCK

Shit!

CHUCK

Got to get there.  Got to see.  C'mon...

c'mon.  Don't be such a wuss.  Be bold.

CHUCK

No way on.  No way off.

CHUCK

This is bad.  Really, really bad.

CHUCK

Come on.  Crawl if you have to.

CHUCK

Got to drink.  Got to drink something.

CHUCK

They don't belong to you.

CHUCK

Got to have shade.  Got to have a hat.

CHUCK

Oh, God.  Thank you.

CHUCK

You deserve a break today...

CHUCK

Damn fish!

CHUCK

Wait a minute.  Wait just a minute.

CHUCK

Don't leave home without it.

CHUCK

Yuck.

CHUCK

Yumm.

CHUCK

Got to get this fixed.

CHUCK

Water, water, everywhere, water, water

everywhere...

CHUCK

Where's the water on this fucking island?

CHUCK

Just rest a minute.

CHUCK

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

CHUCK

Let's see, I waited two days.

(makes marks)

Then I buried Al.

(slowly makes another mark)

Al.  You never made it home, buddy.  Then

American Express got me those clam

things...

(makes another mark)

I dug all those damn holes, the clouds

over the moon...

(makes more marks)

And today, the historic discovery of H,

Two, Oh.

(makes a tenth mark and

underlines it)

Ten days.  Shit.

CHUCK

A crab, it's a crab.

CHUCK

Dammit!

CHUCK

I did it.  I did it!

CHUCK

Jesus.

CHUCK

Stupid fucking thing!

CHUCK

I don't know what I did, God, but

whatever is was, I am really, really

sorry.  You hear me?  Really sorry.

CHUCK

Don't have a choice, do I?

CHUCK

Okay.  Okay now.

CHUCK

You're not getting it hot enough.  Got to

hold the heat.  Got to hold the heat.

CHUCK

Sonofabitch!

CHUCK

Come on.  Come on.

CHUCK

No.  No.  No.

CHUCK

That's the big dipper...Orion...or is

that the Southern Cross...?  Kelly would

know.

CHUCK

Dammit!

CHUCK

Careful now, careful...

CHUCK

Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

CHUCK

If I ever forgot to thank you God, and I

am sure I did, thank you now.

CHUCK

Damn tooth!

CHUCK

Beautiful.  So beautiful.

CHUCK

A star.  It's a star.

CHUCK

It's a ship.

CHUCK

Timberrr!

CHUCK

I heard that...

CHUCK

No more waiting.  Take action.

CHUCK

That's right.  Take action.

CHUCK

How could I be so stupid?

CHUCK

Stupid, stupid, stupid.

CHUCK

You're too low in the water.  Too damn

low.

CHUCK

Dust thou art -- that's for damned sure

-- and unto dust shalt thou return.

CHUCK

Shit!

CHUCK

Please...please...please...

CHUCK

Firewood.  I need firewood.

CHUCK

What the fuck are you doing?

CHUCK

Hang on.  Just hang on.

CHUCK

Shit.  Shit.  Shit.

CHUCK

Whoo, pig.  Sooey!

CHUCK

No pain, no gain.

"1000 DAYS LATER"

CHUCK

Chips?  Dip?

CHUCK

No?

CHUCK

Another fucking day in paradise.

CHUCK

Help me, Wilson...

CHUCK

No!  Wait!  Come back!

CHUCK

Wait!  Wait!

CHUCK

You old airhead, you need a makeover.

CHUCK

Wilson, you bad!

CHUCK

What do you think?

CHUCK

You don't share much, do you?

CHUCK

I guess I know how Kelly felt.

CHUCK

You said our life was a prison.  Dull.

Boring.  Empty.  I can't begin to tell

you how much that hurt.  I don't want to

lose you.  I'm enclosing some salsa, the

verde you like.  Use it on your sticky

rice and think of home.  Then come home

-- to me.  We'll find the spice in our

lives again.  Together.  I love you.

Always.  Bettina.

CHUCK

He never got it.

CHUCK

She's probably found someone else.  I

would have.

CHUCK

Hello.

CHUCK

What the hell are you waiting for?

CHUCK

Canteens.  Sea anchor.  Got to weave

rope.  Spears.  A sail.

CHUCK

Now I'm hoping that if this is airtight

I'll get condensation down here, a cup or

so a day.  If I'm careful it should be

enough.

CHUCK

If I never return, know that here lived

Chuck Noland for four years.  I drew

these paintings.  I made these marks.

And then I took my fate in my own hands

and set forth to save myself, God

willing.

CHUCK

Wilson, my main man.  Time to go.

CHUCK

Wonder what odds Stan would give me on

this.  I'd say 90-10.  Against.

CHUCK

Wilson, we're out of here.

DISSOLVE TO:

CHUCK

Slow down, damn you!

CHUCK

Catch it catch it catch it --

GOODCHUCK

Save some for tomorrow.

BADCHUCK

Catch another fish tomorrow.

BADCHUCK

Shit!  Shit!  Shit!

GOODCHUCK

Stay calm, identify the problem.

Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix

rope.

BADCHUCK

With what?  There's nothing to fix it

with.  This rope comes undone, you're

going to drown.

GOOD CHUCK

Just get up and fix it.

BADCHUCK

Too tired.

GOODCHUCK

Get up.

BADCHUCK

Feels so good to lie here.

GOODCHUCK

Get up, damn you.

BADCHUCK

Can't.  Need water.

GOODCHUCK

You've had today's water.

BADCHUCK

Thirsty.

GOODCHUCK

Come on, shape up, get going, you can do

it.

BADCHUCK

No water, no work.

GOODCHUCK

Okay look, I know you're tired, I know

you're thirsty, but give it one more

shot, you've just got to do a little

more.

BADCHUCK

Do too much, I'll die.

GOODCHUCK

Do too little you'll die.

BADCHUCK

Going to die anyway.

GOODCHUCK

Okay, look have an extra swallow.

BADCHUCK

No more water, you said.

GOODCHUCK

Take it.

BADCHUCK

No.

GOODCHUCK

Take it, damn it.

BADCHUCK

No.

GOODCHUCK

Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the

damn water.

GOODCHUCK

Stop.  Enough.

GOODCHUCK

Think.  Got to use something else.

BADCHUCK

If they can't see you, what's the point?

GOODCHUCK

Survive today, that's the point.

GOODCHUCK

Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too

far south.

BADCHUCK

You don't know where you are.  You missed

the shipping lanes.

GOODCHUCK

Moon's too bright.

BADCHUCK

You're putting off the inevitable.

GOODCHUCK

I'm putting it off.

BADCHUCK

That's what's happening to you.

BADCHUCK

You're rotting away.

BADCHUCK

Get water!

GOODCHUCK

Fix raft first.

BADCHUCK

Water water water --

GOODCHUCK

You like that?

GOODCHUCK

Lost your mate?

GOODCHUCK

You're beautiful.  Marry me.

BADCHUCK

You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the

raft.

GOODCHUCK

No, don't go.  Look, I've got fish.

GOODCHUCK

Please don't dive.  Please.

BADCHUCK

Look what you've done.

BADCHUCK

What are you doing?

GOODCHUCK

Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't

kill my friends anymore.

BADCHUCK

You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or

you die.

GOODCHUCK

Why do they have to die for me?

BADCHUCK

They'd eat you if they could.  They're

laughing at you.  Listen.

GOODCHUCK

Got to eat.

GOODCHUCK

I am so sorry.

CHUCK

I'm an angel.

CHUCK

Here!  Here!

CHUCK

No...no...no...

CHUCK

Sea anchor!  Let out the sea anchor!

CHUCK

Stop!

CHUCK

You fucking murderers!

CHUCK

I know you're talking about me!

CHUCK

(very softly)

Take me with you.

CHUCK

Why me?  Why me, God?

BADCHUCK

Listen to this, Wilson.

(deep voice: God)

Because you piss me off.

BADCHUCK

You're falling apart.

BADCHUCK

First you eat your fat, then you eat your

muscle.

BADCHUCK

Then you eat your mind.

GOODCHUCK

Roll on you deep and dark blue ocean

roll.

GOODCHUCK

I'm late, I'm late, for a very important

date.

BADCHUCK

I'm lost.  Goodbye.

GOODCHUCK

No!

BADCHUCK

Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean

would feel so good, the water's so soft

and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.

GOODCHUCK

You quitter you quitter you quitter.

BADCHUCK

The sea is lovely, dark and deep.

GOODCHUCK

But I have promises to keep.

(rolls over)

And miles to go before I sleep.

(props himself up)

And miles to go before I sleep.

(purpose now)

Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.

BADCHUCK

Use the sail for a sea anchor and you

won't move.

GOODCHUCK

If I don't have a sea anchor I'll

capsize.

BADCHUCK

Die tomorrow or die today.

BADCHUCK

That's death knocking, knocking on your

door.  Crazy little woman come knocking,

knocking at my front door...

GOODCHUCK

Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other

people get through a lot worse.

BADCHUCK

Yeah, sure, what?

BADCHUCK

I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink...

GOODCHUCK

What?  Are you sacrificing yourself for

me?

GOODCHUCK

Damn it!  I had to do it!

GOODCHUCK

I'm sorry!

GOODCHUCK

I know there's a moral here, God, but

right now I'm just going to eat.

GOODCHUCK

Forgot to say grace.  Sorry Mom.

GOODCHUCK

Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts and

Christ and the bounty about to receive,

or something...amen.

GOODCHUCK

Please don't leak.  Please.

GOODCHUCK

Don't look at me.  It was that Dorado.

GOODCHUCK

You know, Wilson, every now and then we

should say thank you.  Thank you God.

BADCHUCK

Thank you for fucking up my life.

GOODCHUCK

Not again.

BADCHUCK

He's going to get you, going to get

you...

GOODCHUCK

Get away from me!

GOODCHUCK

Get him get him get him.

GOODCHUCK

Where are you?  Where are you?

GOODCHUCK

Stop!  You're using energy.  Move slowly.

Be patient.

BADCHUCK

What are you smiling about?  They'll be

back.

GOODCHUCK

I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody

Hotel.  With Kelly.

GOODCHUCK

The music ends.  We go back to the table.

The waiters have brought dinner.  New

York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce.

Mushrooms in brown gravy.  Roasted

potatoes with garlic and rosemary.  Green

Beans with almonds.  Fresh biscuits and

cornbread, dripping with butter.  A nice

salad with ranch dressing.  A jumbo

shrimp cocktail.

GOODCHUCK

No shrimp.

(then)

We eat.

GOODCHUCK

(as the waiter)

For dessert, we have pecan pie a la mode,

we have a double chocolate cake with

creme anglaise, we have a nice pear

torte, fresh key lime pie, or perhaps if

you care to wait a few minutes, a grand

marnier souffle?

GOODCHUCK

Why, bring them all, bring them all.

GOODCHUCK

Here!  Over here!

CHUCK

Oh, shiiiittt!

CHUCK

Permission to come aboard, sir.

CHUCK/CAPTAIN

Permission granted.

CHUCK

May I ask, where are you bound?

CHUCK/CAPTAIN

San Francisco.  And you?

CHUCK

As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco

myself.

CHUCK/CAPTAIN

Would you do us the honor of joining us?

We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork

chops and gravy, cranberries, baked

potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh-

baked bread, apple pie...

CHUCK

No please, join me.  Some sundried fish

strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to

munch on.

BADCHUCK

They're never going to see you.  You're

just another piece of trash in the ocean.

GOODCHUCK

They're on autopilot.

BADCHUCK

They're always on autopilot.  Or else

it's night, or you're in the sun, or

you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll

never see you.

GOODCHUCK

Damn it!  Don't be so negative!

GOODCHUCK

Wilson, what's your story?

BADCHUCK

I float.  You sink.  End of story.

GOODCHUCK

I'm serious.  I'm always going on about

me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.

BADCHUCK

It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.

GOODCHUCK

Shut up.

GOODCHUCK

Don't shirk, don't procrastinate, don't

be lazy.  We're okay today.  We're okay

today.

GOODCHUCK

Shut up.

GOODCHUCK

Shut the fuck up!  I mean it.

GOODCHUCK

What's so damn funny?

BADCHUCK

You are.

GOODCHUCK

Jesus.

BADCHUCK

Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.

GOODCHUCK

It's real.

BADCHUCK

Nothing out there but ocean.

GOODCHUCK

Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson?

What do you see?

CHUCK

Chuck Noland.  Born October 8, 1958.

Died -- pick a date -- July 11, 1998.

And now the epitaph.  Met deadlines.

Kept appointments.  Lost without a trace.

BADCHUCK

What did it matter if FedEx was five

minutes late one day?  The next day we

just start over again.

GOODCHUCK

It matters.  We do the best we can,

that's all we have.

BADCHUCK

Then we've just got shit.

CHUCK

I am writing this to remind myself to

live a better life.  If I am lost,

perhaps you who find this will be

instructed to live a better live

yourself.  Live each day.  Love your

children.  Don't take anyone for granted.

BADCHUCK

Is that it?  Life is a fucking Disney

movie?

BADCHUCK

You can't make it.

GOODCHUCK

Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.

CHUCK

Please, no sharks.

CHUCK

Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.

CHUCK

Shit!  Wilson!

CHUCK

Wilson!

CHUCK

Thank you.  Oh thank you.

CHUCK

My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?

DOCTOR

Under the circumstances your overall

health is good.  Those salt water boils

you picked up on the raft are ulcerated,

but they're healing nicely.

DOCTOR

Hemoglobin's 10.8 -- you're anemic,

that's why we're giving you iron.

Potassium's low -- we're giving you an

electrolyte solution with your IV.

Sodium's over 150, way too high.  You may

experience swelling in your extremities

as you rehydrate and discharge the salt.

In spite of your dietary deficiencies

there's no sign of mental deterioration.

DOCTOR

What's so funny.

CHUCK

Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still

ache?

DOCTOR

Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency.

Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the

above.

CHUCK

All I ate was fish.  That's solid

protein.

DOCTOR

Protein digestion is very costly in water

usage.

CHUCK

Which I didn't have.

DOCTOR

And fish are very low in fat, which is

energy inefficient.  So you're going to

burn up your own cells no matter how much

you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and

pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C,

so you didn't get scurvy.

CHUCK

I am one lucky guy.

DOCTOR

Your body chemistry and your exposure to

the elements would normally lead to

irritability, depression, anxiety,

periods of self-reproach.  It's almost

like schizophrenia.  Different sides of

your personality might come to life,

speak out, act out.

CHUCK

But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.

DOCTOR

If you say you are.

CHUCK

I most definitely say I am.

DOCTOR

Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the

Vietnam POW syndrome with you.

CHUCK

Yes, yes he did.

DOCTOR

You are aware of the potential

disruptiveness on your loved ones when

you return to your old life?

CHUCK

Not to mention on me.

DOCTOR

You sure you don't want some counseling?

CHUCK

Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on

the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be

back, I can't tell you.  I just want out

of here.

DOCTOR

Well, when that IV runs out, you're

through with us.  Just the dentist

tomorrow.

KELLY (V.O.)

Hello.

KELLY (V.O.)

Hello?  Hello?

STAN (V.O.)

Hello?

CHUCK

Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...

STAN (V.O.)

Whoever you are, you are one sick fucker.

CHUCK

Two Valium and the Rolling Stones.  That

ring a bell?

STAN (V.O.)

God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!

CHUCK

It's me.

STAN (V.O.)

You're fucking dead!

CHUCK

I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I

recall, you're the sick fucker.

TECHNICIAN

You sure you don't want to have the

implant done here?  We do quite good

work.

TECHNICIAN

Hmmm, you do have such a lot of tarter

behind these front incisors.  A little

wider, please.

TECHNICIAN

Anyway, so the second prosthetic foot

worked better, but he still couldn't

drive his new Cortina, it being a

standard shift, if you follow me.

TECHNICIAN

But would he hear of me driving him

around?  Not on your bloody life.  Rinse

please.

STAN

Chuck!  God damn!

STAN

God damn.  God damn.  God damn.

STAN

You're alive, you're fucking alive!

CHUCK

I beat the odds!

STAN

You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!

TECHNICIAN

I still need to floss you.

STAN

Hello.

CHUCK

This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his

foot in a shark attack.

TECHNICIAN

Ex-boyfriend.

STAN

Really.

STAN

Uh, there's somebody out here who wants

to see you.

STAN

She thought you were dead.  We all did.

KELLY

I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

CHUCK

Hey...hey...it's okay!

KELLY

You're so thin.  Am I hurting you?

CHUCK

No...no...feels good...

KELLY

Right back, you said you'd be right back.

CHUCK

A few things came up.  Or went down.

CHUCK

You look...wonderful.  I like your hair.

KELLY

I got married.

CHUCK

I thought you might have.

KELLY

I would never --

CHUCK

I know.

KELLY

If I'd known you were alive --

CHUCK

I would have done the same thing.

KELLY

I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One

day Gary was there.  He took care of

everything.  He took care of me.  I was a

mess.

CHUCK

You have any children?

CHUCK

Got a picture?

KELLY

Her name's Hannah.

CHUCK

Is that Jango?

KELLY

No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS

truck.  Can you believe it?

CHUCK

Life's just one big joke after another.

STAN

How about we go somewhere else?

CHUCK

Want to see my raft?

STAN

This stinks really bad.

CHUCK

You should have smelled me.

STAN

Cool ropes.

CHUCK

I braided them.

STAN

Must have taken a hell of a long time.

CHUCK

Time I had lots of.

KELLY

What's that?

CHUCK

That's my sea anchor.  My second one.

Made it out of part of the sail.  It

keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In

theory.

(picks up his still)

And this, this I used to collect water.

About half a cup a day.

STAN

You were how long on this?

CHUCK

Forty-three days.

KELLY

All that time I waited to go on a cruise,

and you went without me.

CHUCK

Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.

KELLY

What's that, written on the sail?

CHUCK

My epitaph.

CHUCK

Bad body chemistry.  Made me a little

morbid.  But I'm all over that now.

STAN

I'll be at the car.

(to Kelly)

Take you to the airport.

KELLY

I buried you, Chuck.  They had to pry my

fingers off your coffin.

CHUCK

There was a coffin?

KELLY

Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.

CHUCK

What was inside?

KELLY

Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo

pig sooey hat, some pictures of that

ketch you wanted.

CHUCK

That about sums it up.

KELLY

Maybe now's when you tell me about it.

CHUCK

The plane went down.  My friends died.  I

washed up on an island.  Then I found

these barrels, built the raft, and here I

am.

KELLY

Yeah?

CHUCK

The tide came in, the tide went out.  I

survived.  That's the headline.  I

survived.

KELLY

Don't overwhelm me with the details.

(she smiles remembering)

You know how I hate that.

KELLY

(gently)

Come on.  Try.

CHUCK

Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for

granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff.

Live each day like it's your last.

KELLY

So simple to say, so hard to do.

CHUCK

Not when you have no choice.

KELLY

You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand

it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged

into something.

CHUCK

I didn't know what really being alone

was.  No one back here does.

CHUCK

We're not meant to be alone.  Not like

that.  Share life, that's what came to me

out there.  Be with someone.

KELLY

This is so unfair.

CHUCK

That's what I told the fish I caught.

But I ate them anyway.

KELLY

You okay?

CHUCK

Great.  Really.

KELLY

What will you do?

CHUCK

I don't know.  I really don't know.

KELLY

I've got to get back to Memphis.

Hannah's babysitter has finals.

CHUCK

It means a lot...that you came.

KELLY

I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.

KELLY

I love you, Chuck.

CHUCK

You too.

KELLY

I'm so glad you're alive.

CHUCK

You too.

STAN

When I first showed up, I thought you'd

lost your fucking marbles.

CHUCK

I never thought it would end.  Then it

did.  It was so great to be saved, I

couldn't stop laughing.

STAN

You need a drink.

CHUCK

For years my only drinking buddy was a

soccer ball.  Wilson.

STAN

To Wilson.

CHUCK

To Wilson.

STAN

So, what's it all about?

STAN

You've been over the line and you came

back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!

CHUCK

Hallelujah.

STAN

I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big

picture, the words in neon...

CHUCK

What's it all about?  It's about being so

thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to

suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what

it's about.

STAN

Do what it takes.  That's what I always

told you.

STAN

To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a

joke.

CHUCK

To life.

STAN

That's all there is.

CHUCK

Believe me I know.

CHUCK

But it's not being bold or being in the

game or rolling the dice.

CHUCK

When I was going crazy, on the raft, I'd

argue with myself about everything.

Because everything had a price.  To get

anything -- a sip of water, a little

corner of shade, an hour's sleep -- I had

to let go of something else.  And then I

could never get it back.

CHUCK

You don't win or lose.  You win and lose.

CHUCK

You win and lose.

STAN

Smile.

STAN

Wave.

MARY

Oh Chuck --

CHUCK

Where's Mom?

ROGER

Waiting for you.  At the farm.  This was

too much --

CHUCK

Tell me about it.

ROGER

Glad you made it, big brother.

CHUCK

Wow.  Thank you.  Great.  Thank you.

Hey, Rasheed, how you doing?  Thank you

all.

STEELE

Welcome home.

STEELE

This is an extraordinary moment.  And it

should be marked in an extraordinary way.

With something we have never done since

this company was founded.

(pause)

Stop the line!

STEELE

Four years ago we placed this plaque in

honor of Charles Noland, and two just

like it in honor of Al Morris and John

Durham, the two brave pilots who went

down with him.

STEELE

Chuck endured years of hardship and

loneliness.  Like Lazarus, Chuck has come

back from the dead.  Chuck, this is your

family, all of us.  So it gives me great

pleasure...to take this plaque...and to

present it to our long lost son.  Welcome

home.

CHUCK

Thank you.  Thank you very much...

CHUCK

Give me a minute.  I've spent four years

looking out at an empty ocean.

CHUCK

It's all so -- big.  You never think

you'll miss -- all this.  But I did.  I

really, really did.  And I missed all of

you.

CHUCK

You've added some new belts, and what's

that?

STAN

Digital laser readers.

CHUCK

Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.

CHUCK

I've never heard it this quiet.

Shouldn't you all be getting back to

work?

CHUCK

Take your time.

STAN

What?

CHUCK

That's what it's about.

STAN

Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get

it.

CHUCK

Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it.

Live it.

STAN

Deep, real deep.

STAN

So where to?  The office?  The hotel?

The beach?

STAN

What, then?

CHUCK

Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.

STAN

(re: the package)

You want that delivered, we'll deliver

it.  That's what we do.

CHUCK

I need to do it.

STAN

Finish what you started.  You haven't

changed, Chuck.  It's still you.

CHUCK

You want to help, help me find the woman

who sent this.

TECHNICIAN

Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts

to tape storage, which is okay because we

access it through the CPC.  Here it is.

(gestures at computer map)

Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku.

Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a

real road warrior.  This package was

Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account

after this package.  No forwarding

addresses after K.L.

CHUCK

What about the sender?

TECHNICIAN

Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas.

Let's run a current check.

TECHNICIAN

Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville,

North Carolina, then...canceled her

account.

CHUCK

Can you find her?

TECHNICIAN

You're looking at a Level III search.

For your Level III, you gotta have E-4

authorization.  I don't have it.

STAN

I do.

TECHNICIAN

Okay, let's let it rip.

CHUCK

Thanks.  For everything.

STAN

No sweat.

ANNOUNCER

And here's more from Dingo Dodd, our

Australian correspondent, on the

extraordinary story of Chuck Noland, the

modern Robinson Crusoe.

DINGO DODD

Shark infested waters!  A deserted

island!  Surrounded by reefs!  Accessible

only by helicopter!  For four years Chuck

Noland survived here alone, eating fish,

coconuts and clams, his only companion a

soccer ball.

DINGO DODD

I'm now in Chuck's cave where he passed

the lonely nights, painting on the walls

like some prehistoric caveman.  What did

Chuck feel?  These paintings tell the

story, but only Chuck knows what they

mean.  And he's not talking.

CHUCK

Check, please.

WAITRESS

No charge, honey.  But could you just

sign that place mat for me?

CHUCK

When'd you start working here?

MOM

Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing

anything, and -- but you're back, you're

really back.  I would have come to

Memphis, but --

CHUCK

I wanted to come here.

MOM

Have some more potato salad.

CHUCK

That was great, Mom, just great.

CHUCK

I've got all this back pay coming.  Why

don't you let me get you a place in town?

MOM

This is my home.  I'm part of the

wallpaper.

MOM

You miss it, don't you?  You miss that

island.

CHUCK

Miss that island?  Mom, come on.

MOM

What a journey you've had.  It seems more

than a person should have to bear.

CHUCK

The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it.

I'm just wondering where it will take me

next.

MOM

Remember the family motto.  In time.  It

will come to you, in time.

CHUCK

FedEx for Bettina Peterson.

BETTINA

Where did you get that?

CHUCK

Charles Noland.  FedEx Special Projects.

BETTINA

You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so

late.

CHUCK

There was an unavoidable delay.

BETTINA

Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You

never gave up.

CHUCK

No.

BETTINA

You know what happened to this?

CHUCK

As much as anybody.

BETTINA

Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.

CHUCK

Okay.  Sure.

BETTINA

I've got some coffee on.  Would you like

some?

CHUCK

(takes a sip)

It's good.

BETTINA

Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten

wet.

CHUCK

Possible.  So you did those wings?

BETTINA

Yeah.  A long time ago.

CHUCK

They're harder to do than they look.

BETTINA

Oh?  You've tried?

CHUCK

Well, I do a little drawing --

CHUCK

Our apologies that it never made it to

the recipient.

BETTINA

He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry

I ever married him.

BETTINA

You look familiar.

BETTINA

I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They

are... You're a gifted artist.  You're

into something very powerful.  Primal.

Truly.

CHUCK

Well, not really, I --

BETTINA

You are.  Yes you are.

(so many things she wants to

say)

What gave you the idea to paint on that

cave?

CHUCK

To tell you the truth -- you did.

BETTINA

Do you...have any more packages to

deliver?

CHUCK

No.  that was the last one.

BETTINA

Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.

MAN

Hey.

CHUCK

Hey.

BETTINA (O.S.)

In here!

MAN

Come back anytime.  Coffee's always on.

Don't even have to bring us a package.

CHUCK

That was my last one.

BETTINA

The list of paints and brushes I did for

you.

BETTINA

Keep painting.  Promise me.

CHUCK

Sure.

CHUCK

Need some help?

DRIVER

You bet I do.  High tide comes right up

to this road.

DRIVER

Hey, thanks.  I'd never have got that out

by myself.

DRIVER

You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?

CHUCK

No.

CHUCK

I used to drive one of those.  A long

time ago.

DRIVER

Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You

want a lift?  I've just got one more

pickup.

CHUCK

Sure.

DRIVER

You're Chuck Noland.

CHUCK

Yeah.

DRIVER/ERICA

I knew it!  You're a legend!  Mr.

Robinson Crusoe.

CHUCK

Well --

ERICA

I knew I recognized you.  My name's

Erica.

ERICA

Did you really steal a crippled kid's

bicycle to make your deliveries, or is

that just some bullshit story?

CHUCK

I didn't steal it, and he wasn't

crippled.

ERICA

Otherwise it's completely true.

CHUCK

Yeah, completely.

ERICA

What brings you out to the sticks?

CHUCK

Had a package to deliver.

ERICA

You?  Personally?

CHUCK

I had it on the island with me.

ERICA

Must be a story there.

CHUCK (V.O.)

Yeah, a long one.

ERICA (V.O.)

I've got lots of time.

CHUCK (V.O.)

So do I.

CHUCK (V.O.)

So do I.
