I've been up since the crack 'a

dawn. What check? Tuition? How

much does it cost to go there?

WHIP (CONT'D)

NO! NO! NO! You decided he needed

private school...lemme talk to

Knuckles. He's not? Tell'em the

phone works both ways. Oh he's my

son because you need a tuition

check...that's great Deana. I'm

glad you tracked me down in Orlando

at 7 in the fucking morning to

shake me down for money. Does he

even like the fucking school? No

I've never seen it. Yeah I wonder

why not too. I gotta 9 o'clock

flight, sit tight 'till I get back

to Atlanta. How am I a liar?

What? No, I'll call you.

YOUNG WOMAN

Was that your wife?

WHIP

That was my ex-wife. But you

Trina, you could be my second or

third wife if you'd just C'mere.

TRINA

Whip, don't even joke about that.

Our flight's at 9, let's hit it.

WHIP

Superstar 27th Baptist King Church?

MARGARET

That's right, Christ the King First

Baptist Church on Hazel and 9th

One of these nights, Margaret, I'm

NAKED GIRL IN HELMET

Othello you bastard!

KIP (O.S.)

8.

NICOLE

KIP-

KIP

Nicole, this is Tiki Pot. He's my

partner in this new series, he

knows a lot about porn.

NICOLE

Kip I need 2 grams of "h."

KIP

Tiki and I are trying to put the

narrative back in porn. Our

Desdemona hasn't shown yet.

(a great idea hatches...)

You should play Desdemona. FUCK

YEAH! You got that fair skin.

NICOLE

Desdemona? What the fuck?

TIKI POT

She do anal, two thousand, one

hour.

NICOLE

I don't do porn, Kip. Just lemme

see the "h."

KIP

Just listen, we're doing an Othello

theme where the Moor finds you in

bed with your nurse and-

NICOLE

He fucks me in the ass?

9.

KIP

Well...yeah. We're giving a whole

new meaning to the "beast with two

backs." That's actually a title

we're toying with...'beast with two

backs' or Hole-thelo or Butt Hole-

thelo...would you be up for it?

TIKI POT

College kid, very clean...BRETT?!

TIKI POT (CONT'D)

Show her the pipe-

NICOLE

Fuck you Tiki, you put that in your

ass and call me in the morning.

Kip, have I ever done that shit for

KIP

baby girl. Hey, c'mon you wanna

stay and shoot some stills for me,

(she begins to cry)

Sweetheart, don't cry.

NICOLE

I just need a little to smoke.

(flashes the cash)

I've got 100.

KIP

No, keep your money, okay? But,

Nicole, this is the Taliban baby,

very big time. It will take you

down.

NICOLE

I can handle it.

10.

KIP (CONT'D)

Don't shoot this shit, it is way

too heavy.

NICOLE

I'm just gonna smoke it. I haven't

done needles in weeks.

KIP

Okay, no needles and take a little

coke and if you start going down

just whiff a little. Okay? I

wanna see you...

CUT TO:

WHIP

Thanks junior.

EVANS

Looks pretty ugly, sir.

WHIP

A little rain never hurt anybody.

We're not made of sugar. What's

the RVR?

EVANS

Half a mile. Right at minimums.

Wind's gusting to 29. 30 is our

crosswind max.

WHIP

I know what our crosswind max is.

Tellem were good to go at the end.

11.

WHIP looks right at EVANS. EVANS keys the radio.

EVANS

Orlando ground. SouthJet 227 will

WHIP stares forward, not looking at EVANS.

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY

Nervous passengers stare out the windows as the JR-88 lumbers

along the tarmac, headed for the runway.

We follow TRINA whose ass looks as good in a tight navy skirt

as it does split bare with orange fluorescence. MARGARET

speaks into the PA mic.

MARGARET

Ladies and gentlemen, the captain

has turned on the seat-belt sign.

Please be sure your seat-belts are

securely fastened, and all carry-on

items are safely stored in the over-

head bin, or under the seat in

front of you. Also, all personal

electronic devices must be switched

off, at this time. Today's flight

time to Atlanta should be 52

minutes. Flight attendants please

take your seats.

INT. COCKPIT -- MORNING -- POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

Heavy rain lashes the nose of the plane. Lightning FLASHES.

We watch the plane steer on to the GLOWING center-line.

INT. COCKPIT

EVANS

Cleared for take off, SouthJet 227.

WHIP

It's like a video game, right?

EVANS

Airspeed's alive, both sides...

Engine instruments are in the

green...100 knots crosscheck...

WHIP

Yep, nothing like a little 30 knot

cross wind to exercise that

sphincter muscle.

13.

EVANS

That's wind shear! A micro burst!

EVANS (CONT'D)

Less than a thousand feet to go!

WHIP

Just watch my airspeed!

EVANS

V1...and...

EVANS (CONT'D)

EVANS (CONT'D)

That's wind shear for sure!

WHIP

Yeehaw! Ride `em cowboy.

ATC

(ON RADIO)

What's your ride like, SouthJet

WHIP

Ah, Departure, we've got some rough

chop here. I'd say moderate to...

WHIP (CONT'D)

No, severe. Definitely severe

turbulence. No meal service today.

TRINA

belts fastened. Thank you.

WHIP

(SINGING)

Feelin' alright -

Not feelin' too good myself -

Feelin' alright -

Not feelin' too good myself...

ATC

(ON RADIO)

SouthJet 227...Be advised there is

a large convective cell four miles

at your 11 o'clock. And another

cell, 2 o'clock, 10 miles. Both

moving rapidly.

EVANS

Copy, Center.

(TO WHIP)

Did you get that?

WHIP

Gottit Skippy. I'm just tryin' to

get birdie here outta this wind

bowl...What did they clear us to?

EVANS

We're cleared to Flight Level one-

eight-thousand.

16.

WHIP

Goddamnit! Enough of this shit!

EVANS

What are you doing!?

WHIP

Leveling off.

EVANS

What!?

WHIP

See that sliver of blue sitting

between those two ugly bastards?

WHIP (CONT'D)

That's a little pocket of smooth

air squatting right over Lake

Kissimmee...

WHIP (CONT'D)

And we're gonna thread that fucking

needle. Turn me thirty degrees

right!

EVANS

(into his mic)

Center. This is SouthJet 227, We

need to divert 30 degrees right...

WHIP

For weather.

EVANS

(into his mic)

...for weather.

17.

ATC

SouthJet 227, this is Jacksonville

Center. 30 Degrees, right,

approved. Report back on course.

EVANS

Report back on course.

EVANS (CONT'D)

Oh, Lord!

WHIP

He can't help you now, brother.

EVANS

Why are you leveling off, sir?

WHIP

I'd like to spend less time in this

shitty air, Kenny. Is that alright

with you?

EVANS

We're approaching maximum airspeed!

18.

WHIP

Fucking right! I'm gonna need some

speed to punch through this crap.

EVANS

You're over-speeding!

WHIP

Not yet!!

ATC

(ON RADIO)

Uh, SouthJet 227, this is

Jacksonville Center. Say altitude.

WHIP

Tell `em we're climbing.

EVANS

(scared and lying badly)

Center...uh...SouthJet 227 is

leaving niner thousand...for Flight

Level 180.

ATC

(ON RADIO)

SouthJet 227, this is Center. You

need to check your Mode-C. Your

transponder indicates you're

descending.

WHIP

You're useless Evans, shit!

(keys the radio)

19.

Center. This is SouthJet 227, we've

encountered some bad air here. Some

pretty severe downdrafts. We're in

our climb now.

ATC

(ON RADIO)

Roger.

EVANS

(TERRIFIED)

Look at your airspeed! You're too

fast for this rough air!

WHIP

I'm right on the line Kenny. Right

on the line.

WHIP (CONT'D)

C'mon sweetheart, show me the sun.

WHIP (cont'd) (CONT'D)

Finally, daylight.

20.

EVANS

Glad that's over.

WHIP

How tall are we?

EVANS

16 thousand. That was incredible

sir...

WHIP

Ken, turn us north and take us

home. Your plane.

EVANS

My plane.

WHIP

(picks up the phone)

Margaret, I'm coming out.

21.

FRAN

Where you been Nicole?

NICOLE

Fuck! Fran...get out.

FRAN

You're like a little ghost. I

never know when you're here.

NICOLE

Get the fuck out Fran!

FRAN

As the building manager I have a

legal right to enter an apartment

if I believe the occupant is

unwell. Especially if said

occupant is not current on her

rent.

NICOLE

Fran, please just gimme a minute.

Get out. I have the rent. I will

bring it down to you. Just let me

shower.

FRAN

You could just bring the check down

now, use my shower. I got good

water pressure. You know that...

NICOLE

You're in the perfect light Fran.

(he smiles, preening)

Back up a little...little more.

22.

FRAN (O.S.)

Tricky tricky, girl. Alright, so

you shower up and come down. For

real. We don't gotta talk about

the check. Hang out a lil bit...

NICOLE

(SOTTO)

In your fucking dreams.

WHIP

Folks, this is Captain Whitaker.

If you look up, I'm here in the

galley. I will wave to you.

WHIP (CONT'D)

Good Morning. I apologize for the

bumps, but Florida just doesn't

seem to like us Georgians. Must be

the beatin' the Bulldogs put on the

Gators last fall.

WHIP (CONT'D)

Stretch out and relax. The air

might stay a little cranky so I'm

gonna ask that you sit tight if you

can, with your seat belts fastened.

23.

WHIP (CONT'D)

We won't have beverage service but

the girls will walk through with

water and snacks and I'll have you

in Atlanta in about 40 minutes.

Thank you.

24.

NICOLE

Oh man...

NICOLE (cont'd) (CONT'D)

Oh no, oh no, oh no...

FRAN (O.S.)

Open up, Nicole! I can smell that

shit cooking! Open Up! Nicole.

Nicole!

MARGARET

How long has Sleeping Beauty been

out?

EVANS

(looks at his watch)

26 minutes. We're going to start

descending any second now.

MARGARET

Well, I guess you'll need to

wake...

25.

ATC

SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center.

Descend and maintain Flight Level

30 thousand.

EVANS

Descend and maintain 30 thousand.

WHIP

The fuck was that?

EVANS

The stabilizer feels really stiff.

WHIP

Don't force it.

MARGARET

(referring to the noise)

That came from the back!

EVANS

I have very little trim control

sir.

WHIP

Margaret, get everybody strapped in

tight.

EVANS

It's pulling right. Hard!

WHIP

Shit! It's locked up, ease up on

the trim don't...

26.

EVANS

(PANIC)

I have no trim at all!

WHIP

We lost our hydraulics!

WHIP (CONT'D)

Center, this is SouthJet 227, we've

lost our hydraulics...and, ah shit!

(TO EVANS)

Power. Pull back the power!

WHIP (CONT'D)

(into his mic)

...we lost hydraulics and looks

like...also our horizontal

stabilizer.

ATC

SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center.

Understand you've lost hydraulics

and stabilizer?

WHIP

(TO EVANS)

Turn on the back-up pumps!

WHIP (CONT'D)

(INTO MIC)

descent, an uncontrolled...

WHOOOAAAAA!!!!

ATC

SouthJet 227, do you wish to

declare an emergency!?

WHIP

Get belted in, everyone belt in.

Brace position!

WHIP (CONT'D)

I've got some control on my side!

My plane!

EVANS

Your plane.

EVANS (CONT'D)

It's stiff as hell. We're pitching

up. Slowing a bit.

ATC

SouthJet 227, say your condition.

WHIP

We need drag. Throw out everything

we've got. Speed brakes. Gear...

(keys his mic)

Uh, Center we're in a dive...lost

vertical control.

ATC

SouthJet 227, Roger.

WHIP

(TO EVANS)

...there enough hydraulics to drop

the gear?

28.

EVANS

Gear's down. I don't think

hydraulics is the problem.

WHIP

Throw out the flaps.

EVANS

Too fast for flaps.

WHIP

We need to start dumping fuel.

WHIP (CONT'D)

Do it!

ATC

(ON RADIO)

SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center. How

do you hear?

WHIP

(keys his mic)

Atlanta. This is SouthJet 227. We

are in an uncontrolled dive,

descending out of...shit I don't

know...

EVANS

(calls to Whip)

21 thousand!

WHIP

(into his mic)

...21 thousand. We are declaring an

emergency! We are dumping fuel! We

have a jammed stabilizer...or

something. We need a block of

altitude to work the problem...and

a heading to the nearest airport!

(YELLS to Evans)

I'm starting to lose it!

29.

ATC

SouthJet 227. Hartsfield-Jackson

International is 10 O'clock and 20

miles from your present position.

Maintain block altitude, Flight

Level 10 thousand through Flight

Level 20 thousand. Turn left

WHIP

(KEYS MIC)

(TO EVANS)

It's getting away from me! I can't

hold...dump the flaps!

EVANS

We're still fast.

WHIP

DO IT! 30 percent!

WHIP (CONT'D)

That bought us a little time. We

need to revert to manual control.

Your side first, pul...

ATC

(ON RADIO)

Thank you.

WHIP (CONT'D)

WHIP

Pull it up, turn it clockwise, push

EVANS

Nothing! No control!

WHIP

Goddamn it!!

WHIP (CONT'D)

I can't let go! Can you reach mine?

EVANS

I can't reach it.

WHIP

No! Don't! Stay strapped in!

(calls over his shoulder)

Margaret! Margaret!

MARGARET

Oh God, Whip. What's happening?!

WHIP

Get strapped into the jump-seat. I

need your help.

WHIP (CONT'D)

Margaret, see that red lever on the

floor next to my chair? The one

that says, Manual Control?

MARGARET

Yes.

31.

WHIP

On the count of three you pull it

up, turn it clockwise, then push it

back down. OK? You ready?

WHIP (CONT'D)

Here we go. One, two...

WHIP (CONT'D)

...three!

WHIP (CONT'D)

Ok. OK. We got something. It's

still stiff as hell. Evans, put in

some power!

WHIP (CONT'D)

I don't know. It feels like the son

of a bitch wants to nose over.

WHIP (CONT'D)

SHIT! POWER BACK!

(he pulls back the power)

I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE THIS!

EVANS

OH NO!

Not good. You got anything closer?

We're in a rapid dive here...

ATC

Roger, SouthJet 227. Uh...Clayton

County is 2 miles at your 4

o'clock.

WHIP

pitch for glide. We have no

stabilizer control.

ATC

EVANS

Oh Lord, we're descending at 4,700

feet per minute, out of 7,000. I

SEE NOTHING BUT HOUSES!

WHIP

OK! Here's what we're going to do!

(TO EVANS)

When I say, you retract the gear,

retract the flaps and trim both

ailerons. But every things gonna be

opposite, so be sure to trim down.

Margaret...

EVANS

Trim down?! What are you gonna do?!

WHIP

When I ask for power, push both of

these forward. Got it?

(MARGARET NODS)

WHIP

Say "I love you Trevor."

EVANS

You mean trim up?! Right? You

MARGARET

I love you Trevor. Be a good boy.

Mommy loves you.

EVANS

What are we doing?! Why would I

trim down?!

WHIP

We're gonna roll it. Ready? Here we

go. I've got control.

EVANS

(TERRIFIED)

WHAT! WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ROLL IT?!!

WHIP

Charlie Anderson.

CHARLIE

How you feelin' Whip? Initial

reports look like you pulled some

move up there, kid. You saved a

lot of lives.

WHIP

How many?

CHARLIE

102 souls on board including the

flight crew, and 96 of them

survived the crash. Six people

died. 2 crew, 4 passengers.

WHIP

4 passengers. Are the rest badly

hurt? Who'd we lose on the crew?

42.

CHARLIE

Listen, protocol is the NTSB has to

make the first contact with you and

the agent is here. Let me go get

him.

NTSB OFFICER #1

Captain William Whitaker? Nod if

you can hear me and understand me.

(WHIP NODS)

I'm Craig Matson from the NTSB and

I'm required as the lead on the Go

Team to make an initial contact

with you after a major incident

like the one you had today.

NTSB OFFICER #1 (CONT'D)

You are in a hospital in South

Atlanta. Are you aware that you

were piloting a plane that went

down?

(WHIP NODS)

I have a doctor here who can

explain your medical situation.

DOCTOR

I'm Doctor Kenan and the good news

is that you are in good condition.

You did suffer a concussion which

is the reason you have a bit of

blurred vision and a headache. You

have numerous lacerations around

your left eye. We're going to leave

the patch on for a few days as a

precaution. But it seems your eye

is OK. MRI's show strained tendons

in your left knee and ankle but you

didn't break any bones.

43.

You have some deep bruising in your

left thigh and you have a few torn

ligaments in your left wrist.

Nothing serious. So as soon as we

clear you from the concussion, and

you feel well enough -- you can go

home. That could be a day, could

be 3 days. Okay?

NTSB OFFICER #1

I won't ask too much of you

tonight, but as I said, the NTSB is

required to make initial contact.

How much do you remember about the

flight?

WHIP

I remember everything until the

crash.

NTSB OFFICER #1

Okay Mr. Whitaker, that's fine. I

am required to inform you that this

incident did result in the loss of

life.

(checks an index card)

The most current information states

that of the 102 souls on board we

lost 6. 2 crew members and 4

passengers. 59 people were treated

and released. 37 people remain in

the hospital and 3 of those cases

are listed as critical.

WHIP

Who on the crew died?

NTSB OFFICER #1

Two flight attendants;

(checks a note card)

Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez

44.

NTSB OFFCIER #1

The rep from your Pilot's Union,

Mr. Anderson, will act as our

contact for you. It's important to

follow your Union's guidance on

press and media. The pilot's union

works closely with the NTSB. So,

I'm gonna head out. Good luck Mr.

Whitaker.

WHIP

I knew Trina Marquez. We spent

some time together.

CHARLIE

Apparently she wasn't strapped in.

A survivor reported that she was

assisting a kid.

WHIP

How's Margaret Thomason?

CHARLIE

(checks his notes)

Broken collar bone, cuts, banged

up, but she's okay. She's here

too. Ken Evans your copilot took a

bad shot to the head. They're

keepin' him in a coma to let the

brain swelling go down. He's

listed as critical, but we feel

good about him. He's gonna be

okay.

WHIP

Charlie, why are you here?

CHARLIE

I'm flying a desk now. I'm a

regional rep for the IAP.

WHIP

You're the rep for the pilots'

union?

45.

CHARLIE

I'm one of a few union reps for the

southeast. When your plane went

down all the reps got a page and

since I know you I shot my hand up

and said I wanted to come and be

the first face you'd see.

WHIP

I'm glad it's you.

CHARLIE

It's good to see you too, Cowboy.

You're gonna be okay. We're gonna

take care of you. That's my job.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

The union will put out a statement

on your behalf. Condolences to the

families who lost loved ones and

gratitude to the brave men and

women on the flight crew.

(WHIP NODS)

And I know you and Deana have been

divorced for a while but maybe she

and your son...?

WHIP

Yeah, Knuckles.

CHARLIE

Yeah, how old's he now?

WHIP

15.

CHARLIE

Wow, you weren't even married when

we flew for Delta. We're

dinosaurs, Whip. Do you want me to

reach out to Deana and see if she

and Will want to come? Any family

you want here, we'll get them here,

stat.

WHIP

No, I'll call her.

46.

CHARLIE

Speaking of which, I have your

phone and some of your personal

effects from the plane.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

Your clothes are toast. Do you

need me to get you some stuff?

WHIP

No, I'm okay. I'll take care of

it.

CHARLIE

I'm gonna head out, let you get

some rest. I'm coming back.

You'll see plenty of me.

WHIP

Thanks Charlie, I really...

(Whip begins to crack)

It means a lot to me that you came.

CHARLIE

Okay. Get some rest now.

WHIP

Charlie, that plane was fucked.

CHARLIE

I know. The way you landed that

plane was nothing short of a

miracle.

WHIP

Harling...Harling...yeah, it's

Whip. I'm in a hospital in South

Atlanta...what? You know where I

am? Okay well fuck...yeah, I'm

okay. What? Well, I'm looking to

get outta here...hopefully

tomorrow. Yeah. But, listen, I

need you to bring me something to

wear.

47.

I don't know -- clothes -- and

smokes, I really need smokes. Tee

shirt, sweat pants....Harling?

I'll put you on the visiting list.

Yeah...and smokes. Just be low

key, no fucking around, Harling.

Cigarettes. Okay? I need

cigarettes. Yeah. Good.

WHIP (CONT'D)

Goddamn it...

HARLING MAYS

I'm on the list baby girl. Check

the list for Mr. Mays. Harling.

HARLING MAYS (O.C.)

If this is gonna turn into a sponge

bath, I'll come back.

NURSE

SIR-

48.

WHIP

It's okay, Harling.

HARLING MAYS

That's right honey, I'm on the

list. Harling Mays. Some say they

Harling knew me.

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

Honey can you hustle us a couple of

daiquiris and a cocktail weenie?

On second thought just bring the

booze. I brought my own weenie.

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

She's offended, and she should be.

I'm a pig. And I hate me. That's

what we have in common Nurse

Ratched...we both hate me.

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

Whip? What the fuck my man?

They're sayin', "Sweet Jesus, what

a fuckin' stud that pilot is."

You're a hero, no shit. You will

never pay for another drink in this

life time. There is crazy news

people all over, look at this shit--

49.

HARLING MAYS

Classic hero worship, you're a rock

star man. You gotta see the video

I've got -- I'm making a doc about

you, well us, y'know?

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

This is outside your condo...

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

Look that's me, and that`s Mark

Mellon...you know that douchey

talking haircut from local Atlanta

channel 3? I said a few words.

Just straight talk, y'know?

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

You okay Captain Whitaker? Easy...

WHIP

The meds they're giving me are

fucking me up -- I'm all shaky and

dried out. I can't sleep good.

HARLING MAYS

Aprazolam? That's generic Xanax and

this Hydrocodone is generic

Vicodin. It's shit, prolly

Canadian.

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

We want the premium stuff. Blue

label...not the fucking well shit.

Where's the dihydromorphinone?

50.

Or just some fucking Palladone

would suffice. What is this?

Fucking amateur hour over here?

Get that goddamned doctor in here.

You just saved a 100 people from

death, they should get your fuckin'

meds right.

(calls to the door)

YO! ROOM SERVICE!

WHIP

Listen Harling, leave it alone.

(HARLING CHILLS)

So you got my message and decided

not to call me back? Did you bring

me smokes?

HARLING MAYS

I decided to come by instead. And

yes I got your fucking message and

yes I brought you smokes.

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

Here is a fresh carton, enjoy. You

fucking earned it -- you smoke your

nuts off, champion. If I were you

I'd fire up right here in the God

damn room. Fuck'em, you're

immortal, you're a fucking God man.

WHIP

Harling...

HARLING MAYS

Sorry Whip. It's just...this is

big time, man. You're a hero in a

time when we really need heroes.

WHIP

Shut the fuck up, Harling...Six

people died.

HARLING MAYS

96 people lived! When are you

gonna take yes for an answer? Pick

up the phone, man. Fuck.

51.

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

Here's a pint of Smirnoff and a few

Red Bulls. You know what I'm

sayin'? I know my customer.

WHIP

Harling, take the vodka with you.

HARLING MAYS

What?! Take the vodka? Dude, are

you insane? I'm gonna just tuck it

in the bottom of your-

WHIP

Take the fucking vodka!

HARLING MAYS

Okay man. Check it out.

WHIP

Look, I'm tired man.

HARLING MAYS

I'm out. You rest up.

WHIP

You gotta come and get me,

tomorrow.

WHIP (CONT'D)

Here are my keys. Go to the condo

and bring me some nice clothes I

can wear, my phone charger and grab

the veal outta my fridge. It's

marked.

HARLING MAYS

The veal?

52.

WHIP

Yeah, the veal that's in my

freezer.

HARLING MAYS

Done and done. What time you need

me here?

WHIP

Tomorrow. I'll call you.

HARLING MAYS

Send the mayday and you're outta

here in 7 minutes.

(A SMILE)

I got you a few stroke mags too.

I've been in hospitals. I know

what you need. JUGS, HOT MILFS in

heat. ASSMASTERS. You should just

stroke it all day. You're a hero --

know what I'm saying? If I was in

here I'd be jerkin' it all day

long. See, there's a smile.

53.

WHIP

Thank you.

WHIP (CONT'D)

I didn't think anyone would have

the same devious thought about

using the fire stairs to have a

smoke...

WHIP (CONT'D)

Don't go. I'll be quiet.

WHIP (CONT'D)

We don't have to talk. Be nice to

just smoke with someone.

NICOLE

Were you on the plane?

WHIP

Yeah, I was. Were you?

NICOLE

Where were you sitting?

54.

WHIP

Up near the front.

VOICE (O.S.)

Tobacco's but an Indian weed,

Grows green in the morn, cut down

at eve; It shows our decay, We are

but clay;...I love the smell of

Nicotina in the morning. Smells

like...victory.

VOICE (CONT'D)

Don't flee dear comrades! Really,

wait for me, please.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN

Can I bum a smoke?

GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)

I should quit, my cancer might get

cancer.

(SILENCE)

Joke. You guys in the plane crash?

NICOLE

He was.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN

(it hits him)

You're the fucking pilot.

55.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)

I saw you on TV. Holy shit, man.

Tough deal, but you walked away or

it looks like you limped away.

WHIP

Yeah, I'm lucky. Goin' home

tomorrow.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN

Home. Home for me is the basement,

they keep cancer treatment in the

basement. I'm livin' here.

WHIP

You're living here?

GAUNT YOUNG MAN

No. I'm dying here.

WHIP

What kind of cancer?

GAUNT YOUNG MAN

Fibro-mixzoid sarcoma, soft tissue

sarcoma. Very rare, God chose me.

WHIP

God chose you? You believe in God?

GAUNT YOUNG MAN

Fuck yeah bitch. You're a stupid

fucker if you don't believe in God.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)

As soon as you realize that the

random events in your life are

God...you will live a much better

life. You spend your life

believing that you have all the

control over what happens.

Bullshit. The plane you're flying

goes down? Out of your control.

God gives you cancer. I have no

control over that. Did God give me

cancer? You bet your ass God gave

me cancer. You think if I begged

for cancer God would have given it

to me?

56.

No...because I assure you I have

begged for God to take it away -

and guess what? I have no control

over that.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)

Can I get another smoke? What's

wrong with you honey? You're

beautiful, do you know that? Do I

scare you? People either have to

pretend they don't see me or

they're drawn to me. It's funny

because people see me as being

close to the other side -- they

feel like I have power or wisdom.

They think I have the answers. Who

knows? Maybe I do. Death gives

you perspective. I lived my life

so indecisive, in a haze. But now

that I'm dying everything is so

clear. It all makes sense somehow.

I'm sorry but I can't get over how

beautiful you are? Look at your

arm, you an addict?

GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)

What's your name?

NICOLE

Nicole.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN

What do you do in the world Nicole?

NICOLE

Not much. I was a photographer and

then I was a masseuse and I wash

hair at a salon sometimes.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN

Where is it? I'll come by, I'm

easy, you can wash my head.

(SHE SMILES)

Do you think you're gonna die?

57.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)

You're not. You're not gonna die.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)

Don't you love her?

WHIP

I don't know her.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN

Bullshit, I do. Random act of God?

Don't think so. Survive a plane

crash to meet a gorgeous girl in a

stairwell. Fuck you man.

(he reflects, then...)

I'm sure they're looking for me.

My family just showed up from Utah.

You know it's bad when they start

flying in. Every morning is

special now, I'm so grateful. It's

a trip, wish I could bottle this

feeling I have...about how

beautiful every breath of life is..

GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)

Can I get a smoke for the road?

WHIP

Here's a pack.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN

Thank you, I'll pass them out in

the cancer ward. Take care Nicole,

you're gonna be okay.

NICOLE

Chemo brain. Chemo makes you

pretty foggy.

WHIP

Yeah?

58.

NICOLE

They call it chemo brain, my mom

used to slur her words and get all

chatty.

WHIP

Your mom had cancer.

NICOLE

Breast cancer, she was only 54.

WHIP

But why'd that guy ask you if you

were gonna die?

NICOLE

I dunno. I flat-lined twice in the

ambulance. Heroin addicts who use

needles tend to die. Especially

women for some reason.

WHIP

Is that right?

NICOLE

I have a pamphlet to prove it. A

girl from AA just came to see me --

(IT'S QUIET)

That guy was a trip. He made it

feel like, I dunno...we were the

last people left on the planet..

(drops her smoke)

...and together we should save the

world.

WHIP

Well, where should we live? If

we're gonna save the world, where

should we do that?

WHIP (CONT'D)

What?

NICOLE

You don't want me.

59.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

What?

WHIP

You don't want me either.

WHIP (CONT'D)

Where do you live?

NICOLE

Why you wanna come visit? It's

luxurious.

(silence between them)

I live in Bankhead, it's south

Atlanta, near the bus station.

WHIP

The luxurious bus station?

NICOLE

Yeah.

WHIP

I'll come visit you.

NICOLE

You're sweet.

WHIP

I will. What's your address?

NICOLE

I live at the Georgian Gardens on

Taylor street.

WHIP

Georgian Gardens?

NICOLE

Yeah.

WHIP

How long are you staying here?

NICOLE

Trying to stay as long as I can but

I don't have insurance to cover

rehab. I'll prolly be out

tomorrow.

60.

WHIP

Oh. Okay. And you're a masseuse?

NICOLE

Yeah.

WHIP

What kind of masseuse?

NICOLE

I've been every kind of masseuse

there is.

WHIP

Good luck Nicole.

NICOLE

You too.

WHIP

Thanks Mike.

HARLING MAYS

Yeah, thanks Mike.

(Harling tips him)

Here's 20 American.

ORDERLY MIKE

Thanks. Good luck, sir.

61.

HARLING MAYS

This is how they get the Stones out

of Madison Square Garden, man. 4

smoked black limos fly outta the

VIP driveway and the fans jump on

the limos...mayhem. Those limos?

Empty. Meanwhile, Mick and the boys

go out the service exit into

delivery vans -- casual, rock star

type shit.

HARLING helps him into the front seat and they pull away.

The Stones, "Gimme Shelter" starts to play...

the hospital. Trucks with towers, cameramen, stringers and

newscasters add to catering trucks and coffee stands as the

vultures wait for the carrion of sound bytes and footage of

survivors.

INT. HARLING'S CADDY -- DAY

Whip watches through the rear window -- the "Media Circus"

disappears as the Caddy rounds a corner. The back seat is

piled with Whip's clothes, most of them still on hangers.

HARLING lights a cigarette and hands one to WHIP who takes

it.

HARLING MAYS

I couldn't find any suitcases so I

just put your shit in grocery bags.

HARLING pulls a cold Becks from a cooler on the floor of the

back seat and uses a bottle opener that's been screwed to the

dash of his car next to the radio to open the beer. He

offers the beer to WHIP who waves it off. HARLING gladly

keeps it for himself... "Gimme Shelter" continues to play...

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

So you're stayin' with me down on

University, right? It's nice. A

lotta young people...good vibe.

Harling tosses Whip a freezer bag marked:"VEAL" -- Whip

begins to open it.

WHIP

No. I'm gonna go to the farm.

HARLING MAYS

The fucking farm?

62.

WHIP

My dad's place. I can't stay at my

condo.

HARLING MAYS

I thought you sold that fucking

place.

WHIP

Not yet.

HARLING MAYS

I'm not sure I wanna stay at the

farm.

WHIP

You're not. Just take me to the

airport to get my car.

Whip finishes opening the freezer bag -- it's full of cash.

HARLING starts to laugh...

HARLING MAYS

first place every two-bit thief

looks is in the freezer?

EXT. ATLANTA RURAL SUBURBAN ROAD - WHIP'S FARM - DAY

WHIP's BUICK turns off the blacktop past a small weathered

billboard: WHITAKER CROP DUSTING. Also a real estate "FOR

SALE" sign is posted in front.

EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- DRIVEWAY -- DAY

Whip pulls into a long, dirt driveway that approaches a one-

story farm house. He gets out of the car. With his cane in

one hand, he uses his free hand to toss the grocery bags

close to the steps and heads inside.

INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

WHIP ambles in and we see the interior of the house bears the

fading patina of a proud American Family. We see PHOTOS --

WHIP in his NAVAL FLYER UNIFORM. A GROUP MILITARY PHOTO -- a

SQUADRON of NAVAL FLIERS on a carrier. WHIP's PARENTS next

to the farm house. WHIP's FATHER stands next to WHIP who is

holding his infant son.

63.

CELL PHONE

You have 127 messages.

(A BEEP)

Message one..."Captain Whitaker,

this is Jim Court I'm with CNN.

We'd like to schedule an

interview..."

(he deletes that message)

Message two..."This is NBC

affiliate KGAT in Athens we're

looking to contact William J.

Whitaker for..."

(he deletes and moves on)

Message three..."Captain Whitaker,

this is Karen James, media

relations with the pilots'

union..."

64.

65.

A series of pictures feature the PLANE in flight and SHOTS

TAKEN FROM THE PLANE, aerials of the farm, etc.

WHIP holds the framed shot of he and his dad as he walks back

to the plane, resting his arm on the wing.

WHIP pulls himself from the wall of photos and stares at his

stuff. We recognize what must be the stuff he took from his

house after his divorce. We see bikes, weights and fishing

gear.

Whip rummages through a box of things packed from his home

office. Trophies, sports memorabilia, citations -- A PHOTO OF

HE AND HIS WIFE from happier times. THEIR WEDDING PHOTO.

Now Whip comes upon A FRAMED BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO of he and

Charlie in their younger, Navy days -- wearing flight suits

and standing on a carrier flight deck in front of an F-14

Tomcat. Big smiles, full of hotshot pilot swagger.

WHIP puts the photo back and spots his golf bag. He roots

out a pint of cheap vodka from the inner pocket.

Next he finds a fifth of bourbon in his bicycle saddle bag.

He goes to the workbench and removes a couple of bottles from

the paint shelf.

EXT. BARN -- DAY

to the house.

EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- NIGHT

65

empty liquor bottles to his garbage cans. He tosses the bag

of empties in a can. His work done, WHIP lights a smoke and

stares at the empty fields that run forever as does the

landscape of his mind. He quietly tries to grasp the horror

he endured and the reality of his survival.

INT. KITCHEN TABLE -- LATER THAT NIGHT

We hear the microwave beep and WHIP retrieves a frozen

dinner.

66.

PHONE RINGS

WHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE

You've reached the Whitaker Crop

Dusting Company, flying lessons and

plane rides. Please leave a message

and it will be returned. Thank

you.

VOICE MAIL

...I think that was the beep. Hey

Cowboy, it's Charlie again.

CHARLIE

(speaking to voicemail)

I'm back in town and I stopped by

the hospital tonight but they said

you went home...so I guess you're

feelin' pretty good, but um we went

out to your condo and the manager

said you had not returned.

VOICE MAIL

So...you may be with relatives,

which I understand. I was really

hoping to see you for breakfast.

I'm at the St. Regis downtown.

67.

There's an executive buffet on the

16th floor - 10 o'clock, okay? If

you get this, please come. Some

important stuff to cover. Be good.

CHARLIE

Whip, hey buddy. Glad you got my

message. Grab a seat.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

Whip this is Hugh Lang; he's an

attorney from Chicago.

HUGH

Nice to meet you Captain Whitaker.

CHARLIE

Siddown. Coffee?

(Whip nods, sits)

Miss, can we get some fresh coffee?

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

We were just talking about your

copilot's wife. She told a

newspaper that "God landed that

plane."

68.

WHIP

God landed the plane?

CHARLIE

I too believe that God landed that

plane. The same way I believe that

God should hit the buffet, the

turkey sausage is excellent.

WHIP

I'm good with coffee.

CHARLIE

Len Caldwell was really trying to

get here this morning.

(Whip seems lost)

Len is the president of the pilots'

union and he wanted to be here with

us and meet with you but they

wanted him at the crash site. So..

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

Whip, as you know, when a plane

crashes, the NTSB sends a "go team"

to the crash site immediately.

WHIP

They find the flight data

recorders?

CHARLIE

Yes they found them, perfectly

intact.

WHIP

Great. That solves everything.

The recorders will tell the story.

Why do we need a lawyer from

Chicago?

CHARLIE

Hugh's an attorney who specializes

in criminal negligence-

WHIP

Criminal negligence?

69.

HUGH

WHIP

CHARLIE

HUGH

WHIP

HUGH

WHIP

HUGH LANG

WHIP

CHARLIE

HUGH

PUBLIC HEARINGS-

70.

WHIP

Charlie, what do I need to know?

I'm already tired of this guy.

HUGH

The NTSB `go team' collects blood,

skin and hair from the flight crew

for a toxicology report.

WHIP

When did they do that?

HUGH

In the hospital. It's the first

thing they do. Do you remember

having your blood drawn on the

night of the crash?

WHIP

Do they have the results of these

blood tests?

HUGH

Yeah, they do.

WAITRESS

Anything else for you gentlemen?

WHIP

Did I just see warm cinnamon rolls

come out?

WAITRESS

Yes sir.

WHIP

Bring me one wouldya? Actually

bring me two, okay sweetie?

WAITRESS

Comin' up.

HUGH

An initial report shows alcohol in

your bloodstream at a level of .24.

In the U.S.

71.

-- one of the most lenient drunk

driving countries in the world --

you go to jail for driving with a

number over .08. And by driving, I

mean a car.

WHIP

What does that mean? I had a beer

the night before I flew. And

what...That made the tail of the

plane explode?

CHARLIE

Separate issues Whip-

WHIP

I need a lawyer.

CHARLIE

Hugh is your lawyer.

WHIP

I need a bigger lawyer. A lawyer

who understands that I flew a

broken plane and without me at that

stick there'd be 102 funerals, not

6.

HUGH

We're talking about prison not

funerals. Somebody has-

WHIP

To write checks, well it's not me I

promise you that. And as long as

they're writing checks, write me

one because someone put me in a

broken plane. I'd love a check.

CHARLIE

EASY WHIP-

HUGH

This tox report states that you

were drunk and high on cocaine,

felonies punishable by 24 years in

jail. And if your intoxication is

proven to have caused the death of

the 4 passengers you'll get 4

counts of manslaughter. That could

be life in prison.

72.

Can I now do my job on your behalf

and kill this tox report?

WHIP is listening. CHARLIE tries to reign it in.

CHARLIE

He'll get it done, Whip. It's what

his entire life is about. Trust

me, trust him.

(Whip stares at Hugh)

Don't worry Whip, you're gonna walk

away the hero you deserve to be.

WHIP

I'm not worried, Charlie. I promise

you that. No one could have landed

that plane like I did, no one.

INT. ST. REGIS HOTEL -- LOUNGE -- DAY

Close on TV -- A SPLIT SCREEN -- CNN's PIERS MORGAN on one

side of the screen asking questions of JIM TILMON, an

aviation expert.

WE NOW SEE A PHOTO OF WHIP IN HIS SOUTHJET AIRLINE UNIFORM.

PIERS MORGAN

Captain Tilmon, we wanna play a

portion of the black box that all

of the news outlets have grabbed

hold of...

WHIP

(ON TELEVISION)

When I ask for power, push both of

these forward. Got it? What's your

son's name?

WIDER...WHIP STEPS UP TO THE BAR, GLANCING AROUND.

The BARTENDER steps up to serve WHIP...

BARTENDER

What'll you have?

WHIP

Can I get an orange juice?

The BARTENDER leaves to grab the orange juice.

73.

MARGARET (O.S.)

Trevor.

WHIP (O.S.)

Say "I love you Trevor."

MARGARET (O.S.)

Why?

WHIP (O.S.)

The black box.

MARGARET (O.S.)

I love you Trevor. Be a good boy.

Mommy loves you.

BARTENDER

That's it?

WHIP

And a double shot of Stoli.

PIERS MORGAN

(ON TELEVISION)

Wow. That audio paints a strong

picture. Captain Whitaker is

surely a hero in my opinion.

JIM TILMON

(ON TELEVISION)

Absolutely. However, every

incident is different. The actions

of the pilots on SouthJet 227 will

be heavily scrutinized. It's

protocol for any investigation.

74.

CRASH SITE REPORTER #1

Kevin, it's still chaotic here at

the site. Apparently a small

ministry was conducting services

near to where the plane came down.

So the scene here is a mix of

survivors and first responders, I

was able to catch up with an actual

passenger moments ago...

PASSENGER 1

We were in a nose dive and people

were screaming and yelling and then

the plane turned upside down and we

had to hold on to our seat belts to

keep from falling out of our chairs

-- I saw one kid fall to the floor

and this flight attendant picked

him up and handed him to his

dad...I didn't see her again.

CRASH SITE REPORTER #1

More details and more reports of

the casualties are continuing to

fly around. I can tell you that

there appears to be many, many

survivors. That's all I have for

now. Kevin?

CRASH SITE REPORTER #2

Rebecca, surviving passengers are

being put in ambulances, police

cruisers and even first responder

vehicles and they are being taken

to local hospitals for treatment.

Some of the injured appear serious

and it's safe to assume at this

point that there are at least a few

fatalities. Let's roll the tape of

the passenger I caught up with

earlier.

75.

PASSENGER 2

We turned like a corkscrew and all

I could think was, "this is really

happening, I'm going to die" and

then all of a sudden the plane was

upside down but steady and the

pilot must have known how to fly it

that way. He flipped it back over

and landed it hard.

CRASH SITE REPORTER #2

Obviously a harrowing ordeal for

those on the troubled plane. This

is Callie J Kenner for News 5.

CRASH SITE REPORTER #3

Folks in the houses that border

this field came running from their

houses...

NEIGHBOR

I thought it was thunder at first.

But it shook the ground hard.

Thunder don't do like that. I ran

outside and I could hear people

yelling and I could see a small

fire at first. I just took the

dogs and headed down there. Then I

saw the plane crumpled on the

ground. I never seen nothing like

that in my life.

CRASH SITE REPORTER #3

Just like that plane, this

community is shattered. Folks here

remain on edge as media trucks

continue to line their small road

and crowd the field where the plane

still lies. Back to you, Tom.

76.

CRASH SITE REPORTER #4

We're gonna take another look at

the cell phone footage that

captured the last moments of

SouthJet's Flight 227.

WE SEE THE GRAINY CELL PHONE FOOTAGE OF THE PLANE

After the PLANE levels off and smacks down in the field, we

return to REPORTER #4 in the crash field.

CRASH SITE REPORTER #4 (CONT'D)

Many hours have passed since the

footage you just watched but the

crash site remains active as

investigators work through the

night. Using flood lights and

miners' caps, teams continue to

comb the crash field looking for

the answers to the hard questions

as to what brought down SouthJet's

flight 227. Those answers remain

in darkness as do the broken pieces

of the aircraft. Hopefully

sunlight will bring answers. For

now this is Kent Johnson reporting.

INT./EXT. WHIP'S BUICK -- QWIK STOP LIQUOR STORE -- DAY

A 12-pack of beer hits the passenger seat as Whip climbs

behind the wheel. Whip cracks open a "handle" (half-gallon)

of vodka and takes a liberal pull. Whip's shoulders relax as

the alcohol kicks in.

another huge slug of vodka -- and pulls out.

INT. WHIP'S BUICK -- ATLANTA STREET -- DAY

Whip is at the wheel. A cigarette in one hand, an open beer

in the other. He cruises slowly -- searching street signs

with his beer-buzzed eyes.

WHIP

(TO HIMSELF)

Taylor street, Taylor st...ah, here

we are.

Whip rolls the Buick to a stop and scans the street.

77.

P.O.V. THROUGH DRIVER SIDE WINDOW

WHIP spots a SIGN: "Georgian Gardens Apartments" Suddenly,

NICOLE flies into frame and tosses a box into the back of her

Toyota. She hustles off leaving the hatchback open.

EXT. THREE STORY APARTMENT BUILDING -- ATLANTA -- DAY

WHIP parks his car at a fire hydrant right in front of

NICOLE's building and gets out with his cane. He pops a fresh

beer and looks at the building, looking for a proper

entrance. He notices Fran walking quickly along the second

story balcony -- carrying a baseball bat.

Whip thinks nothing of it and begins casually poking through

the stuff in Nicole's car -- a random collection of junk

including clothes and photographs -- mostly of rock bands

performing.

Now, WHIP HEARS an argument escalating between Fran and

NICOLE.

FRAN (O.S.)

The guy in Unit 1 just told me you

stayed here last night?!

NICOLE (O.S.)

Franny relax, I'm just getting my

shit outta here, okay?

FRAN (O.S.)

What about the rent! YOU OWE ME

MONEY!

He heads off...

EXT. THREE STORY APARTMENT BUILDING -- STAIRCASE -- DAY

WHIP does a decent job of making his way up the exterior

staircase. That beer is making his leg feel a little better.

WHIP moves more aggressively up the stairs as the ARGUMENT

GROWS LOUDER...

FRAN (O.S.)

Who do you think broke down this

fucking door to let the paramedics

in there? Huh?! -- You gotta pay

for all this.

78.

NICOLE (O.S.)

I'm sorry. Just let me get my shit

and get outta here. I will pay you

when I can.

FRAN (O.S.)

I know, just take a shower with me.

How hard is that? C'mon.

NICOLE (O.S.)

No. I'm not doin' that.

FRAN (O.S.)

If I had a bag a dope you'd be on

your knees in my shower right now,

right? Come on...

NICOLE (O.S.)

DON'T TOUCH ME!

FRAN (O.S.)

Gimme the camera, for collateral.

What's it worth?

NICOLE (O.S.)

No fucking way! I will kill you if

you touch this camera! I will pay

for all of this! I will pay, okay!

WHIP

The fuck are you doin'!?

79.

FRAN

(gives Whip a puzzled

LOOK)

Hey, don't I know you?

WHIP

Keep your fucking hands off her!

WHIP (CONT'D)

You okay?

(SHE NODS)

Is this all the stuff you want from

here?

NICOLE

(nods again, recovering)

Just this stuff.

WHIP

Okay, start taking that stuff down.

FRAN

She owes me 1100 bucks! Plus

damages!

WHIP

You wanna spend a thousand bucks

suing her and get jack shit? Or do

you want to make a cash deal with

me?

FRAN

Give me 700 in cash.

WHIP

You're a creep...with your baseball

bat bullshit...

80.

WHIP (CONT'D)

(sorts through his cash)

I'll give you 400 in cash.

WHIP (CONT'D)

Good boy. Now help her get that

box in her car.

NICOLE

Ah...my car doesn't run. It won't

start. I'm taking this with me.

WHIP

Your car doesn't run? What were you

gonna do?

NICOLE

I don't...I...I was...

I don't know what I was gonna do.

WHIP

(with deliberate malice)

Then put the fucking box in my car.

NICOLE

What's your name?

WHIP

Whip.

81.

NICOLE

Thank you, Captain Whip.

INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' "You Really Got a Hold on

Me" plays as WHIP eases himself into a recliner using his

cane. On the small table next to him rests his beer and an

unopened bottle of bourbon with a glass of ice. WHIP cracks

the seal on the bourbon bottle and pours a drink. He takes a

sip and chases it with his beer.

WHIP now starts to remove the brace that we clearly see under

his basketball shorts. As he takes it off he tries to

massage his aching leg.

NICOLE enters the living room, fresh from a shower. WHIP

studies her -- she's beautiful and innocent.

WHIP

You okay?

NICOLE

I was gonna lay down, get some

rest.

WHIP

Okay.

WHIP takes another sip before returning to massaging his leg.

NICOLE

Is it really okay that I stay here?

WHIP

Yea. I want you to stay.

NICOLE walks over to WHIP and kneels down and gently takes

over massaging his leg. WHIP exhales.

WHIP (CONT'D)

That feels better.

NICOLE

It's throbbing because the blood is

having a hard time getting back to

your heart.

NICOLE stands and takes the drink out of WHIP's hand and sets

it down. She now bends down and kisses him softly. She now

stands and takes his hand, leading him in to the bedroom.

82.

INT. WHITAKER FARM -- WHIP'S BEDROOM -- DAY

WHIP's been awake for hours as he sits at the foot of the

bed. Whip's wearing a long sleeve tee shirt and sweat pants

and no shoes. He looks at NICOLE -- sleeping angelically on

her side of the bed. Whip watches her sleep for a long

moment, until...

80

car pulling up the driveway.

INT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN DOOR -- DAY

WHIP opens the door to find HUGH in his driveway.

WHIP casts a strange figure with his bare chest, boxers and

brandishing a shotgun. They stare at each other.

HUGH

Do you wanna shoot me or can I come

inside?

WHIP

C'mon in. I'll shoot you inside.

HUGH walks closer to the porch. WHIP questions him.

WHIP (CONT'D)

You just decided to drop by?

HUGH

Your voice mail is full and you

never answer your cell phone. I

called your cell 10 times.

WHIP

I turned it off.

HUGH nods as the explanation lands.

HUGH

I thought we'd take a ride.

WHIP measures HUGH's intention...

WHIP

Okay, gimme a minute. Wait here.

dressed.

83.

HUGH

You can see the initial impact

sheared the right wing clean off.

If only the left wing had come off

at impact, I think everyone would

have walked off that plane.

WHIP

The left wing partially pulled away-

HUGH

It snapped but stayed connected to

the airframe. So it whipped back

towards the plane, hit the fuselage

in front of the tail. If you were

sitting in the last 6 or 7 rows on

the left side, it was like being

hit by a train.

WHIP

I drank a lot the night before that

flight. I drank that morning too

and I used coke to straighten up.

HUGH

I know, it's in the toxicology

report.

WHIP

But that's not the reason this

happened.

HUGH

I know.

HUGH (CONT'D)

The John the Baptist Pentecostal

Mission.

84.

MINISTER

"He will wipe away every tear from

their eyes, and death shall be no

more, neither shall there be

mourning, nor crying, nor pain

anymore, for the former things have

passed away." -- Revelation 21:4

HUGH

They helped pull survivors out of

the wreckage. Now they come out

here every day and have a mass 30

minutes prior to the crash. And

then they sit in silent prayer for

10 minutes at 9:42...which is when

you went down.

NTSB INVESTIGATORS

HUGH (CONT'D)

Ellen Block, she's the head of the

investigation for the NTSB. She's

the one that's gonna ask the tough

questions.

WHIP

Why'd you bring me here?

HUGH

I needed you to see this.

WHIP

You trying to scare me?

HUGH

I need to know that you can handle

all this.

85.

HUGH (CONT'D)

Listen clearly. There was a

mechanical issue with the plane,

but what you and I know? Is that

this was an act of God. I'm gonna

fight to get the NTSB to place "act

of God" on the probable causes

list.

WHIP

Who's God would do this?

HUGH

So here's the deal. Avington Carr,

the owner of the airline, is on our

side...and he's got big friends in

Washington. He wants to sit down

with us. 10 O'clock tomorrow

morning.

HUGH (CONT'D)

You can't drink. You're under the

microscope. You can't be out

buying liquor. No bars, no drugs.

WHIP

I'll stop. I can stop.

(Hugh stays quiet)

I told you I can stop. I won't

drink.

HUGH

10 O'clock tomorrow morning with

Mr. Carr, the owner of the airline.

MR. CARR

I never wanted that fuckin'

airline. Neither did my brother.

86.

MR. CARR (CONT'D)

It was my father that wanted it. I

like baseball.

HUGH LANG

I like baseball.

LEN CALDWELL

Everyone in Georgia likes baseball.

MR. CARR

Yeah...so what's the deal Lenny?

Is your union gonna survive this

one? More importantly? How big a

check you think I'm gonna have to

write?

LEN CALDWELL

There were 6 fatalities on the

PLANE-

HUGH LANG

The 2 crew members don't get

settlements like the passengers.

That's a workman's comp claim, part

of the union contract -- they do a

dangerous job and they know it.

MR. CARR

You're the lawyer for the pilots'

union?

LEN CALDWELL

No, this is Hugh Lang, the attorney

we brought in to handle the

criminal side of Captain Whitaker's

situation.

MR. CARR

Yes, and what is Mr. Whitaker's

situation? NTSB is up my ass with

a flashlight. We had to give them

access to everything.

87.

(shakes his head)

And everyone is curious about

Captain Whitaker.

CHARLIE

I flew with him. He's a great

pilot.

MR. CARR

Is he a drunk?

CHARLIE

He's a heavy drinker. Should I

bring him in?

MR. CARR

In a minute. Alright, so let's get

down to it, Lenny. What does the

union plan to do about this blood

test that says Whitaker was high on

booze and coke? This guy's a real

peach.

HUGH

I'm gonna kill the toxicology

report.

(feels eyes of disbelief)

It was done incompetently. The

last time the toxicology equipment

they used was calibrated was in

June of 2009, which is 18 months

past code. Their log that should

clearly state who labeled the blood

vials and when, is very incomplete.

And they aren't sure who stored

them. They used a preservative in

the vials that has in some cases

caused blood to ferment and

register higher in an alcohol test.

That's what I've done so far. I

can handle this.

MR. CARR

I like this guy Lenny. He makes me

wanna go out and sniff a few lines

and fly a jet.

88.

LEN CALDWELL

Mr. Carr, we're gonna fight to push

all the fault on Jackson

Ridgefield, the manufacturer.

MR. CARR

Oh and you think they're gonna just

open their check book and buy us

all lunch? Good fucking luck.

What's my exposure Jim?

CARR'S BUSINESS GUY

The awards to the families could

kill the airline.

MR. CARR

Fuck the airline. The insurance

companies can have the goddamm

airline. I just don't want them to

come sniffing in my other pockets.

LEN CALDWELL

Speaking for the pilots' union? We

don't want your airline to go away.

We enjoy your contract with us and

we will protect Captain Whitaker

and in turn protect your airline.

MR. CARR

That's sweet Mr. Caldwell, but if

the NTSB leaks that toxicology

report showing my pilot was flying

that plane drunk? We're all

fucked.

CHARLIE

So far we've been lucky.

MR. CARR

Lucky?! Are you that goddammed

dumb?! You think they're waiting

for a light news day to splash the

headline, "Drunk, coke-addled pilot

crashes a plane?!"

MR. CARR (CONT'D)

My brother's in DC on his knees at

the foot of the throne begging for

forgiveness. And so far it's

working.

89.

They've got their boot on the neck

of this girl Ellen Block runnin'

the show for the NTSB and she is

pissed. Can you handle that?

HUGH LANG

Trust me, I'm gonna kill the

toxicology report. That's my job.

CARR'S ATTORNEY

I wish you luck, but we're still

sorting out the best way to go

forward legally. We might split

from you and go it alone.

HUGH LANG

To go it alone? Without us? That

would be what the French call "a

big fucking mistake."

MR. CARR

Does Whitaker know he's going to

jail?

HUGH LANG

I haven't had a client go to jail

yet.

MR. CARR

He's going to jail. He belongs in

jail. You bet your ass he's going

to jail, the question is...is he

gonna die in jail?

HUGH LANG

You're wrong, Mr. Carr.

CARR'S ATTORNEY

Last time I checked, 6 counts of

manslaughter is life in prison.

MR. CARR

Life in prison, what we in Georgia

call "all day long."

90.

INT. CARR'S OFFICE -- WAITING ROOM -- DAY

WHIP stands up as the meeting spills into the waiting room.

Handshakes are exchanged as CARR walks to WHIP and offers his

hand to shake.

MR. CARR

They tell me you're some kind of

pilot.

quickly puts a hand on WHIP's back and leads him away like a

heavyweight being returned to his corner after pre-fight

instructions.

THE TELEVISION IN WHIP'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

We are now in WHIP's living room watching HOME MOVIES...

WHIP'S VOICE

Get up! What? You can't get up?!

(Whip is laughing...)

C'mon, Knuckles Whitaker drags

himself up and goes long...go.

We watch an 8 year-old WILL WHITAKER run long as the ball

flies to him. He catches it and on-screen WHIP hollers.

WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Touchdown Whitaker! Atta boy!

C'mon back. What? Come back and

do it again. Tired? Junior, you

don't know tired. I'm not going

out. You go out. Keep running.

We pull away from the screen to find WHIP who sits on the

couch. A large bottle of vodka appears empty amidst many

dead beers and an ashtray that overflows.

WHIP moves in drunken slow motion as he attempts to free a

cigarette from the pack and light it. He freezes at one

point and places his hands straight out in front of himself,

a strange, involuntary, drunken reset. His stare is a 1000

miles offshore; he is anywhere but on this planet. Oblivion.

The light from the HEADLIGHTS of a car in the driveway wash

across the walls of the living room. We hear a car door open

and women exchange good byes.

SHEILA (O.S.)

Keep coming back, Nicole. One day

at a time.

91.

NICOLE (O.S.)

I know, one day at a time.

INT. WHITAKER FARM -- DOOR -- NIGHT

The door pushes open and NICOLE comes in with the Big Book of

AA in her hand.

NICOLE

Hey. Sorry I'm a little late, but

we went for coffee after the

meeting...

(Whip doesn't look)

Whip?

NICOLE goes close to see WHIP look at her with a non-focused

stare. She sees the table and reads the situation.

NICOLE watches as WHIP stands up. In his oblivion he tries

to focus.

WHIP

Don't, don't, don't! I'll get him.

Knuckles, junior. See him. Yeah.

I'm not calling again. Fuck him.

He didn't call. Not back. Not

calling back.

NICOLE backs away as she watches the blacked-out ballet play

itself out in slow, tragic fashion. WHIP motions to his lips

as if he is smoking. He freezes and then steps forward and

trips in to the coffee table. Whip falls to the ground.

NICOLE checks WHIP's face to see his eyes partially opened

but passed out. NICOLE goes to the bedroom and returns with

a blanket that she covers WHIP with. She also places a

pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled to

the side so he doesn't choke.

NICOLE looks around the room. She begins to collect the

bottles and straighten up.

INT. WHITAKER FARM -- BEDROOM -- MORNING

CLOSE ON WHIP's FACE as he struggles with a thick hangover.

He rubs his face and smacks his lips, he's dry as a bone.

WHIP shakes his head as he tries to focus his look through

the bedroom window. He looks out to see NICOLE sitting on a

chair enjoying the landscape. WHIP rubs his head before

walking to the kitchen.

92.

WHIP

Morning.

NICOLE

Are you okay? You were in bad

shape when I got home.

WHIP

Tired. Guess I drank a bit.

NICOLE

A bit?

WHIP

You wanna count the fuckin' beers?

They're still in the garbage.

Vodka too, is that okay with you?

NICOLE

It's more than okay, Whip.

WHIP

Good.

NICOLE

I've been watching the sky change

as the sun rises. Beautiful.

(holds up the camera)

Perfect light, I went out and took

some great shots.

93.

WHIP

Lemme see that camera.

NICOLE

My mom got it for me. Towards the

end, when she knew she wasn't gonna

recover. She maxed out her credit

card to buy me that camera and a

lighting kit.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

It's just so beautiful here. Did

you grow up here?

WHIP

It was my grandfather's farm, my

dad grew up here. He was a pilot

in World War II, flew with the

332nd. See the landing strip out

there? He built that. He ran a

crop duster outta here until the

EPA put an end to that.

(she nods, listening)

He traded the crop duster for a

used Cessna. He flew that damn

thing all over. It's still in the

barn. I was gonna sell this place

after my dad died. Then I got

divorced...

NICOLE

And your mom?

WHIP

Dead...she's dead. Your dad still

alive?

NICOLE

I'm pretty sure my father lives in

Colorado.

WHIP

You got no relationship with him.

NICOLE

He drank. It was my mom that

raised me. She was incredible.

94.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

She held it together for so long, I

couldn't tell how sick she was.

Even through chemo she looked

beautiful.

NICOLE leans over and blows out the candle.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

They gave her very heavy meds for

pain. Dilauded, morphine,

oxycontin. I started taking them

with her. We would get all

medicated and sit in our back yard

and talk and talk and watch the sun

go down. We'd be so stoned that we

couldn't get up to go inside when

it got dark.

(laughs, fights the pain)

I know it sounds crazy to get

hooked on dope with your mom, but

she was dying and we spent her last

seven months together like

teenagers, trading stories about

boys and whatever. She loved me.

WHIP lifts the camera and points it at NICOLE. She contorts

her face into a sly smile. WHIP snaps it...she laughs.

The blue sky is the perfect backdrop as we reveal...

INT. ST. THOMAS AQUINAS CATHOLIC CHURCH -- DAY

WHIP in a dark suit walks amidst mourners who file out of the

church. The center of attention is a large, distraught woman

in her 60's being consoled by what appears to be her son and

his wife. The WOMAN wears a pin that holds a photo of TRINA.

WHIP stands at the bottom of the steps, watching folks,

looking for someone. Suddenly, a 9 year-old BOY stands in

front of him. The BOY locks eyes with him.

BOY

I'm Trevor. You saved my mom.

WHIP looks up to see MARGARET THOMASON walking towards him.

She has her left arm in a sling underneath her jacket. We

can see a bandage along her hairline. WHIP smiles, obviously

uncomfortable. MARGARET hugs him.

95.

MARGARET

It's great to see you, Whip.

WHIP

You too Margaret. Broken collar

bone?

MARGARET

Yeah, and some stitches but I'm

fine. I really am.

(she goes quiet)

It was a nice service. I mean,

look at all these people that

wanted to say goodbye. She looked

beautiful in there.

(Whip is blank)

Didn't you think so, Whip? Like

she was gonna wake up and smile.

WHIP

I didn't go in. I couldn't.

MARGARET

Trevor, find Dad. He's by Mr.

Benton, there.

(TREVOR LEAVES)

Are you okay? You should come to

the counseling group. The union

has great people for us to talk to.

WHIP

No. I can't, really. I will, but

just not now.

MARGARET

Take care Whip, okay?

WHIP

Yeah...y'know...I'm in the middle

of this investigation. The NTSB is

investigating the crash-

MARGARET

I know. I'm going in to see them

next week.

96.

WHIP

I'm nervous because I was out the

night before the crash at dinner-

MARGARET

With Trina...

WHIP

Yeah and I had two glasses of wine.

And they might ask you about my

condition that morning and if you

thought I had anything to drink.

WHIP (CONT'D)

What?

MARGARET

I've known you 11 years and you're

gonna stand here and tell me you

and Trina went to dinner and you

drank two glasses of wine? Sounds

like a nice restaurant Whip, which

one was it?

WHIP

You have to tell them it was an

ordinary day. I mean it was an

ordinary day. You know I was in

shape to fly. You have a problem

with saying that?

MARGARET

It's a lie. Whip, it's a lie.

Trina told me you two hadn't been

to sleep.

WHIP

My lack of sleep made the plane

fall apart, huh Margaret? I'm just

trying to get it straight. You

think that another pilot would have

been able to land that plane and

save more lives?

MARGARET

I didn't say that Whip. I can't

imagine another pilot doing-

97.

WHIP

Well can you imagine Trevor at this

same church looking at you in that

box in there? Or my son having to

come and see me in prison?

MARGARET

Please Whip, enough. Don't you

think we've all had enough.

(Whip is quiet)

What do you want me to say?

WHIP

It was an ordinary day. The storm

right after we took off was very

severe, but as far as the flight

crew was concerned it was a

perfectly ordinary day.

NICOLE

Are you okay? How was it?

WHIP

It was okay, okay. How're you

doin'?

NICOLE

Well, I got through my first day.

They haven't fired me.

WHIP

That's good. Cause for a

celebration.

NICOLE

They needed someone to work the

night shift. They asked me and

it's time and a half so...

98.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

I gotta vest and here's my name

tag. Oh oh oh....I got you

something..

(hands him a nice lighter)

It's a P-51 mustang on there...

(flies her arms like

WINGS)

You're dad flew a P-51, right?

WHIP

(stares at the lighter)

He did. So should we get some

dinner?

NICOLE

I promised Sheila I would be at the

meeting tonight. She's the one

that's been helping me, my sponsor.

Can we do it tomorrow night? And

Please, Whip don't make me choose

between dinner with you and the

meeting.

WHIP

No, it's okay. You should go.

NICOLE

Why don't you come with me? We'll

eat after. It's an open meeting.

WHIP

Open meeting?

NICOLE

That means anybody can come.

Anybody.

WHIP

Even me?

99.

A.A. SPEAKER # 1

The cop is shining his flashlight

on me. I'm standing there behind

the dumpster, wearing nothing but

my girlfriend's panties, vomit on

my chest and I say to the

cop...about two beers.

A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D)

That's why they call me "Two-Beer"

Barry.

A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D)

Don't worry Ed, I got the format

right here. I'm sorry, Ed's giving

me the stink eye. Let me get back

to the format...

(reads from the format)

I'm Barry. I'm an alcoholic.

THE ASSEMBLY

(IN UNISON)

Hi Barry.

A.A. SPEAKER # 1

Are there any other alcoholics

present?

A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D)

I like meetings that have us all

identify. Because it makes me tell

the truth about who I am. It

reminds that I never ever told the

truth. I lied about everything.

My whole life had been a lie. And

I was told that I would never get

sober if I kept lying.

A.A. SPEAKER #1

I mean, lying's what I'm good at.

If I know anything in this life

it's how to lie, especially about

my drinking.

100.

We pan the faces and everyone seems immediately connected.

Except WHIP who leans over to NICOLE.

WHIP

I gotta go. Okay?

(NICOLE NODS)

Can uh...

(points to Sheila)

NICOLE

Yeah, Sheila. She can take me back

to work.

SHEILA

(extends her hand)

I'm Sheila.

WHIP shakes her hand before quickly escaping as if from a

fire. We stay close on WHIP's face as he walks out. BARRY

continues his pitch.

A.A. SPEAKER #1

Like I said, I would lie about

everything. It didn't matter what

it was. My whole life had been a

lie. A series of lies strung

together by me. And when I drank?

It was worse. What I came to

understand was that, my lies were

killing me. And that remains the

great fact for me...My lies will

kill me.

INT. ROUND TABLE RESTAURANT -- BAR -- MINUTES LATER

WHIP enters the bar and we hear off camera a voice coming

from the TV above the bar.

PIERS MORGAN (O.S.)

The NTSB is focusing their

investigation on the flight crew,

specifically Captain Whitaker.

KEN EVANS (O.S.)

Sir, I am not at liberty to discuss

Captain Whitaker or any of the

flight crew.

WHIP looks up to the TV.

101.

KEN EVANS

(ON TELEVISION)

And in truth, I don't have much to

say about him.

PIERS MORGAN

(on a split screen)

So, safe to say that he remains a

mystery.

KEN EVANS

(ON TELEVISION)

Sir, those are your words not mine.

PIERS MORGAN

(ON TELEVISION)

I've been speaking to some people

who are very close to the NTSB

investigation and they are very

confident that they will be able to

determine exactly what brought this

plane down.

KEN EVANS

(ON TELEVISION)

I'm sure they will sir.

PIERS MORGAN

(ON TELEVISION)

Thank you, Ken and Vicki Evans.

KEN EVANS

(ON TELEVISION)

Thank you, and God bless.

102.

WHIP

How're you feeling, Ken?

EVANS

Happy to be alive.

VICKI EVANS

Blessed to be alive.

WHIP

I'm Captain Whitaker, I was flying-

VICKI EVANS

I know who you are.

EVANS

Ma'am can you give us some privacy?

Thank you.

(TO WHIP)

Come on in sir. Shut the door.

WHIP

Listen, how long have you been...

EVANS

Outta the coma? Two days.

WHIP

I didn't mean to disrupt your whole

day. I know they been swamping you

with interviews. You were great on

CNN...

EVANS

Both my legs were crushed and my

pelvis snapped. I'll probably

never walk again, least not without

a walker or braces. I'll certainly

never fly again.

WHIP

I'm sorry Ken.

103.

EVANS

That plane was doomed the second

you sat in the chair. You reeked

like gin or somethin'. I called

Vicki from the plane before we took

off. That's when the rain kicked

up.

WHIP

I don't know how much you remember,

but the plane started to fall

apart.

EVANS

I remember everything until we

crashed. I know what went on.

WHIP

What are we talking about?

EVANS

I don't know Captain Whitaker, what

are we talking about?

WHIP

I just wanted to get a sense from

you what you thought caused the

crash.

EVANS

Was it the fact that you got on the

plane drunk from the night before?

EVANS (CONT'D)

The NTSB is coming back tomorrow to

finish taking a deposition from me

about the events on the flight.

WHIP

You think you'd be alive without me

on that plane?

EVANS

No, we'd all be dead. But are you

gonna argue that your physical

state was tip top?

WHIP

I'm not gonna argue anything with

you.

104.

EVANS

Sit, please sit.

(WHIP SITS)

I never shared my opinion about

your physical state the morning of

the flight. I've never said word.

EVANS (CONT'D)

The flight was pre-ordained. I've

prayed on it Captain. Vicki and I

have prayed on it. There's only

one judge --

VICKI EVANS

Praise Jesus.

EVANS

And he has a higher plan for you

sir. This event although tragic in

its loss of life is also a

celebration of life.

EVANS (CONT'D)

Nothing happens in the Kingdom of

the Lord by mistake.

VICKI EVANS

Praise Jesus.

EVANS

Captain, will you pray with me?

EVANS (CONT'D)

Jesus our Lord and savior we thank

you for blessing Captain Whitaker

with courage and wisdom. For

guiding his hand on that fateful

morning. In his divine light we

were saved. Praise Jesus.

105.

VICKI EVANS

Praise Jesus.

It is quiet for an extended beat. Finally...

WHIP

Praise Jesus.

reverence.

EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT

A small pickup truck rambles to a stop in the driveway. We

hear music and laughter as NICOLE gets out.

NICOLE

Thanks for the ride guys. I'll see

you tomorrow.

COWORKER

Keep it up Nicole, you could be

employee of the year.

They all laugh; Nicole waves as they drive off. She walks

towards the house which is dark. She hears music and looks

towards the barn to see bright light escaping through the

sagging doors and split wood walls.

EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT

NICOLE slowly approaches the almost glowing barn door. Her

curiosity compels her to pull it open.

INT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT

The door swings open to find the plane pointed towards the

driveway with an aged patina but revitalized shine. Lenny

Kravitz, "Fly Away" blares from the stereo...

WHIP emerges from the cockpit. He's still in his suit but

with his jacket off and sleeves rolled up. He's energized

like an excited kid. He runs up and kisses her.

NICOLE notes the cloud of smoke hanging in the air and the

burning cigarette in the ashtray, empty beers.

WHIP

Looks great right?

106.

NICOLE

It's kind of...beautiful.

WHIP

It's a Cessna 172, it was my dad's.

He kept it perfect.

NICOLE

Does it work...

WHIP

Yeah, he flew this plane a few

months before he died. I learned

to fly in this plane. You can land

it anywhere.

WHIP (CONT'D)

My friend Harling and I flew it to

Jamaica.

NICOLE

Jamaica? In this?

WHIP

We set off for an overnight fishing

trip two hours south of here. We

ended up in Bethel, Jamaica.

NICOLE

You're insane.

WHIP

It was like a picture on a post

card. The white sand and sky blue

water. Most beautiful place I've

ever been.

NICOLE

Was the water warm?

WHIP

Yeah, really warm.

NICOLE

That's my kind of place.

WHIP

Let's go.

107.

NICOLE

Sure, why not.

WHIP

Let's go tomorrow.

NICOLE

You're serious?

WHIP

We'll leave in the morning...we'll

just go. Start over.

NICOLE

Whip, we can't.

WHIP

It's a beautiful beach, it's

paradise.

NICOLE

I'm worried about you.

WHIP

(laughs a bit lit)

I'm fine thanks.

NICOLE

No you're not, you're really not.

You need help, Whip. I think you

need rehab.

WHIP

You go to a couple of AA meetings

and all of a sudden you think

you're Jesus Christ? Worry about

yourself.

NICOLE

We're the same Whip, you and me,

we're the same-

WHIP

WE'RE NOT-

NICOLE

WE ARE-

108.

WHIP

I didn't suck dick to get high.

And don't give me a whole...

NICOLE

Never Whip, I never in my life-

WHIP

Your mom died and dad drank and

bullshit, bullshit, bullshit --

NICOLE

Stop. Please stop.

WHIP

Is that why you shot dope?

NICOLE

That's not fair-

WHIP

Well there's a lot of people out

there who lost their mom who've

never had a drink in their life.

NICOLE

You're sick, Whip.

WHIP

I choose to drink.

NICOLE

Do you? You choose it? I don't

see a lot of choice goin' on.

WHIP

I choose to drink! And I blame it

on me. I'm happy to. I've got an

ex-wife and a son I don't see.

Why? Because I choose to drink!

109.

WHIP

Alright look, I was loaded when I

crashed that plane. With this

investigation going on, I don't

know what's gonna happen. Come to

Jamaica with me.

NICOLE

Whip. I'm afraid I'll use again.

WHIP

Come with me. I need help, I do.

NICOLE

I'd love for you to get help, Whip.

WHIP

When we get to Jamaica we can go to

the local hospital. I'll do it for

you. Anything you want.

NICOLE

I don't wanna use again. I can't.

I won't make it back.

WHIP

I'll be sober. I won't force you

to stay. I promise if you don't

like it or if I don't clean up?

You can leave.

WHIP (CONT'D)

It's so beautiful there. We'll

leave before noon. I'm a great

pilot. You'll get to see so much.

110.

WHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE

You've reached the Whitaker Crop

Dusting Company, flying lessons and

plane rides. Please leave a message

and it will be returned. Thank

you.

CHARLIE

(speaking to voice mail)

Hey Whip, if you're there

pickup...I got some good news...

111.

WHIP

Yeah, I'm here. What's goin' on?

EXT. NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAY

WHIP sits in his car. Rain pounds the windshield as we watch

him expertly add vodka to a half-full bottle of orange juice.

WHIP gives the bottle a shake before taking a long drink.

WHIP takes another drink before re-capping the bottle and

stowing it in the glove box. WHIP gets out and we watch him

walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar. A SECURITY

GUARD meets him and takes him inside.

INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY

WHIP is now alone in the huge, brightly lit hangar. He sees

the plane.

The JR-88 has all of its pieces laying as close together as

possible. Like the skeleton of a T-Rex in a museum. The

sight is awesome, breathtaking. WHIP walks closer to the

twisted wreck and stops. WHIP is overwhelmed by the sight

and as he is about to leave...

CHARLIE steps out of the passenger door and calls down to

WHIP.

CHARLIE

Here's our guy. C'mon.

WHIP walks towards a ramp that leads up to the hole in the

plane where the door used to be. CHARLIE stands at the top

of the ramp. Suddenly HUGH steps out of the plane...

HUGH

Captain Whitaker, we've won.

WHIP doesn't move as HUGH starts down the ramp.

HUGH (CONT'D)

This is what we call in my

profession a "walk over."

CHARLIE

They've scheduled the hearing. It's

in 10 days.

CHARLIE and HUGH reach the bottom of the ramp.

112.

HUGH

But these hearings can be tough.

You just need to stay sharp and on

course and answer the questions

correctly. It's no longer a

question of your condition but the

condition of the plane.

HUGH (CONT'D)

I've had an "Act of God"

successfully added to the list of

probable causes.

WHIP

Look, it's simple. I flew a broken

plane.

CHARLIE

You got it. That's right.

WHIP

And what about my toxicology

report?

HUGH

(trying to stay calm)

I killed it. They have no physical

proof that you were intoxicated on

that plane. And no eye witness

claims. But there's a problem.

HUGH (CONT'D)

Because of the turbulence at the

beginning of the flight and then

the crash, there was never any

drink service on the flight. But,

they found two little vodka bottles

in the galley trash bin. There was

no physical evidence found on the

bottles, no DNA, no finger prints.

But both the bottles were uncapped

and empty. The only people who had

access to those bottles and could

have drank them were the flight

crew. Margaret, Evans and Camelia

Satou all had clean tox reports.

That leaves you and Trina Marquez.

113.

WHIP

Okay. I see...where this is going.

That's funny that they found two

bottles.

HUGH

Why?

WHIP

Because I drank three. One's

missing.

HUGH LANG

When I met you I couldn't believe

what a flip, drunk, arrogant

scumbag you were.

WHIP

Fuck you too, Hugh.

HUGH LANG

But I did the research and heard

the analysis from the experts. I'm

in awe of what you did.

WHIP

Can I go now?

HUGH LANG

THE NTSB AND THE FAA TOOK 10

EXPERIENCED PILOTS AND PLACED THEM

IN SIMULATORS. THEY RECREATED ALL

OF THE EVENTS THAT LED TO THIS

PLANE FALLING OUT OF THE SKY!

HUGH LANG (CONT'D)

Do you know how many were able to

safely land these broken planes?

HUGH LANG (CONT'D)

Not one. Every pilot crashed and

killed everyone on board.

114.

WHIP

Yeah. So?

HUGH

You have no capacity to accept the

responsibility for the miracle you

performed and the lives you saved.

WHIP

Great. I'm going home.

HUGH LANG

Do you want to go to prison? I'm

trying to save your life!

WHIP

What fucking life?! Don't kill

yourself on my account, Hugh.

HUGH

Okay, I'm done here. I'm running

out a faith that this guy's gonna

make it, Charlie.

WHIP

(turns on Hugh)

You wanna talk about me like I'm

not here? Like I'm fucking dead?

HUGH

(to Whip now)

This NTSB hearing is a Federal

Agency Hearing. Do you understand

that? It's in 10 days and if I

show up with you like this?!

HUGH (CONT'D)

Everything we've done? Everything

I've done? Goes out the window.

That's not on me. I did my job.

It's your job, Charlie, to get him

straight and get him to the church

on time.

115.

WHIP

Yeah Charlie just get him home.

Sober him up long enough to save

the union's contract and that fat

fuck's airline. Fuck you. I

shoulda died on that plane.

shiny floor of the hangar and into the growing rain storm.

EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE THE WHITAKER FARM -- DAY

The rain has subsided as WHIP pulls up to his driveway.

Whip turns into the driveway and spots a NEWS VAN in front of

his house. He makes a U-turn and speeds away.

EXT. NICE MODEST SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- DAY

The rain has completely stopped but everything remains wet as

WHIP bangs his front tire in to the curb as he attempts to

park in front of a well-maintained house.

INT. WHIP'S BUICK -- PARKED - SAME TIME

large orange juice bottle.

EXT. NICE MODERN SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- MOMENTS LATER

WHIP gets out of his car and makes his way across the street

and towards the house. We notice...

The DRIVER OF A BLACK PRIUS that has been parked farther down

the street gets out of his car, talking on a cell phone.

EXT. FRONT DOOR -- NICE SUBURBAN HOME -- SAME TIME

WHIP walks up the steps and knocks on the door. He waits a

beat and knocks again. Finally, it opens -- DEANA, an

attractive, well-dressed woman in her 40's, stands there

staring.

DEANA

What are you doing here?

WHIP

It's lovely to see you too Deana.

May I come in?

116.

WHIP

Thought I`d come see you and Will.

(calls out, loudly)

KNUCKLES! YOU HERE?

(it's very quiet)

We haven't talked at all since this

whole thing happened and I just

thought we should talk.

DEANA

You know that I prefer that you

call us.

WHIP

Call you? Like anyone in this

house has called me in the last

three years to say anything other

than "Where's the money?"

DEANA

Have you been drinking?

WHIP

Well that took...what? 17 seconds?

(fake checks his watch)

It took 17 seconds for you-

DEANA

I'm gonna ask you to step outside

of the house, please.

WHIP

(has continued to rant)

LADIES and GENTLEMEN it took

EXACTLY 17 SECONDS FOR DEANA

COLEMAN to ask me if I have been

drinking! A NEW WORLD RECORD!

DEANA

I'm calling the police.

WHIP

You're asking me to leave the house

I bought for you?! Very good.

WILL (O.S.)

I'm telling you to leave.

117.

WHIP

William Whitaker, junior. The man

of the house. Nice of you to call

me back.

WILL

I'm telling you to leave.

WHIP

You are? Are you the man of the

house?

WILL

You upset my mother. You gotta go.

WHIP

I'm your father, tough guy.

WILL

You're a drunk. Now get the fuck

out!

WHIP

You don't know who the fuck I am!

WILL

(pulling open the door)

I sure don't.

WHIP

What did you say?

WILL

I said, "I sure don't." Why don't

you tell me? Who the fuck are

you?! Who are you? Huh? WHO ARE

YOU?!

WHIP

I'm outta here. I'm outta here. I

know where I'm not wanted.

118.

DEANA'S PORCH REPORTER #1

How come you won't talk to the

press?

DEANA'S PORCH REPORTER #2

A lot of people are going out of

their way to keep you out of the

media, are you hiding something?

DEANA'S PORCH REPORTER #3

Do you still live here, Captain

Whitaker?

DEANA'S PORCH REPORTER #1

How well did you know Katerina

Marquez, the flight attendant that

died?

WHIP

Folks, please give us some room.

(gets down the stairs)

At the appropriate time I will tell

my story. Now is a time for

grieving and taking care of those

injured. Thank you. I appreciate

your interest in me but I ask that

you leave my family in peace.

119.

The POLICE begin to disperse the NEWS RATS. WHIP pulls an

officer aside.

WHIP

I'm Captain Whitaker, I was-

YOUNG COP

Yes sir, I know who you are.

WHIP

Can you get me to my car?

YOUNG COP

(STUDIES HIM)

Anything you need, sir.

WHIP walks with the YOUNG COP who shields him from the fray.

INT. WHIP'S BUICK -- DEANA'S STREET -- MINUTES LATER

We can see the YOUNG COP standing in front of the driver side

door, shielding WHIP from the press who stay away.

116

drunk but controlled. He looks at his hands. They are

shaking.

INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE -- OFFICE - CLOSE ON TELEVISION - NIGHT

We see WHIP on the TV repeating the speech he gave reporters

on DEANA's front lawn...

WHIP

Now is a time for grieving and

taking care of those injured.

Thank you. I appreciate your

interest in me but I ask that you

leave my family in peace.

A REPORTER now wraps up the piece...

TELEVISION

A reasonable request from a quiet,

heroic man who's been through so

much. This is Tilda Banden

reporting from Devonwood.

Now a DESK ANCHOR changes stories...

120.

DESK ANCHOR

In a related story, tonight at 10

Cale Rawson talks with aviation

experts to see if the tragedy of

flight 227 could have been avoided.

WHIP

Hey, Charlie. Thank you. Amanda

was so nice to let me in. It's

just...I couldn't find a safe

place.

CHARLIE

What the hell is wrong with you? I

spoke to Hugh, he told me that you

went to your ex-wife's house?

Drunk as a skunk and the news crews

showed up?

(Whip just stares)

And the police escorted you out?

WHIP

I think it's okay. I've been

watching and I think it's okay.

CHARLIE

Hugh checked every media outlet

that covered it and it looks like

we're good. You come off fine.

WHIP

Okay. Good then. Listen Charlie,

here's the deal-

CHARLIE

No Whip. No deals. Look at you.

I have no idea what you're gonna do

or say, ever. You're all over the

place. I was the one guy in your

court. I was your apologist, your

defender. But not anymore.

121.

WHIP

No. I can do this.

CHARLIE

You're about to be questioned by a

Federal Agency about piloting an

airliner drunk...an airliner that

crashed. And you continue to drink

and stumble around. What kind of

crazy do you have to be to do that?

I'm scared of you.

WHIP

Let's just stick to the plan.

CHARLIE

You can't stick to anything.

WHIP

This whole thing has just been so

heavy, it's killing me. Tell Hugh,

I can do it. Look, I really wanna

fly again, get back to my life and

be done with all this shit.

CHARLIE

This hearing is 10 days away. Hugh

busted his ass to try to get you

excused, but there's no way. You

have to appear.

WHIP

Let me stay here. They have my

houses all staked out now. Let me

stay here until the hearing,

Charlie. I won't leave the house.

CHARLIE takes a long look at his old, troubled friend.

CHARLIE

You can't drink here, Whip. You

can't drink in my house. Can you

do that?

WHIP

I won't drink.

122.

HUGH

You look great, Whip. I mean that.

WHIP

Thank you. I feel really good.

HUGH

I heard you haven't had a drink in

8 days.

WHIP

9 days...

(checks his watch)

Two hours and 26 minutes...but

who's counting?

CHARLIE

Officer Edmonds?

OFFICER EDMONDS

Yes sir.

CHARLIE

Whip, Officer Edmonds will be

staying here tonight. Any problems

he'll handle it.

HUGH

Well, Whip we just wanted to make

this as easy for you as possible.

123.

CHARLIE

Just get a good night's rest.

Relax, order up a steak, get a

movie.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

Okay, cowboy, I'm out. The hearing

starts at 10, so we should plan on

9 for breakfast here in the room.

WHIP

Wait, Charlie, thanks for letting

me stay with you. I needed it.

CHARLIE

You did great cowboy.

WHIP

You've got a beautiful family.

CHARLIE

I'm very blessed.

HUGH LANG

I made you a copy of my entire file

on you and the investigation. I

also tried to anticipate what you

might be asked under oath and I

wrote out some non-damaging

responses. It's all in there;

photos, testimony, interviews...I

called Ellen Block let her know

that you're here and all tucked in.

WHIP

So does she have the knife out for

me?

HUGH LANG

Remember she's limited in what she

can ask you. You're not on trial

but you are under oath. She's

probably not happy that I killed

the tox report, but you'll be fine.

124.

HUGH LANG (CONT'D)

I'll see you in the morning.

125.

WHIP

Hello? Anyone?

126.

CHARLIE

Good morning, how's our man?

127.

OFFICER EDMONDS

Not a peep.

CHARLIE

I think your pilot overslept.

HUGH

You didn't let any girls in there

last night did you?

OFFICER EDMONDS

No sir, not a soul. No one came in

or out.

OFFICER EDMONDS (CONT'D)

I have a room key.

HUGH LANG

Did he disappear?

CHARLIE

Whip? Hello?

128.

HUGH

Where is he?

CHARLIE

Whip? WHIP!

CHARLIE

WHIP?!!! WHIP!!!

HUGH

Is he dead?

CHARLIE

I DON'T KNOW!!!

HUGH

IS HE DEAD?!

WHIP

Yes!!! I'm dead!!!

OFFICER EDMONDS

Should I get an ambulance?

CHARLIE

Yes!

HUGH

Wait!...just wait, Charlie...let's

think about this.

CHARLIE

Get him to the bed...

(to the Officer)

129.

Can you wait outside and don't let

anyone in here? Thank you.

HUGH

Son of a bitch! You worthless

motherfucker, what a waste! I

cleared the decks for you...you

piece of shit. You just fucked it

all up like the piss drunk you are!

CHARLIE

WOAH!!! WOAH!!! WOAH!!! Enough!

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

What time is it?

HUGH

9:14, the hearing is in 46 minutes.

CHARLIE

How much grace do you think we got?

WHIP

Amazing grace...how sweet the

sound...that saved a wretch like me-

HUGH

Shut the fuck up you drunk...

WHIP

I once was lost and now I'm found

was blind but...now...well I'm

still kinda blind.

CHARLIE

We probably have an hour before we

really need to get him to the

hearing and it's just downstairs.

HUGH

We need a wheel chair.

WHIP

Call Harling Mays.

130.

CHARLIE

Harling's got a wheel chair?

WHIP

Harling's got cocaine.

HUGH

Cocaine? Cocaine?!

HUGH and CHARLIE exchange a desperate look...

CHARLIE

WHAT'S HIS NUMBER!?

HUGH

This is fucking insane. And

criminal.

WHIP

609-237-1184. We're in 609 so

just...

CHARLIE

(DIALING)

237...1184...

WHIP

INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- MORNING

CHARLIE prays for a voice on the other end...it appears...

CHARLIE

Harling? Harling this is Charlie.

I'm a friend of Whip's...yeah. We

need you to do a very early, very

discreet...uhm...Whip needs bananas

and you need to bring them to The

St. Jerome Hotel downtown...how

many bunches of bananas?

(Whip holds up 3 fingers)

3 is the answer I'm getting -- you

will be well compensated...the The

St. Jerome Hotel room 1027...

CHARLIE hangs up and looks at WHIP who is mostly passed out

again. CHARLIE looks to HUGH.

131.

HARLING MAYS

(SINGING)

Come mista tally man tally me

banana...Whip, what's the deal man

you look like you're hurtin' for

certain...shut the door, interior

lock!

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE MERCH

MOTHERFUCKER!!!

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

Everyone except Whip and myself

take three steps away from the

table.

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

I need three things.

(focuses on Charlie)

Two glasses of water, a credit card

and a hundred dollar bill.

CHARLIE

All I have is a twenty.

HARLING MAYS

(takes the card and bill)

That'll do. And I need to make a

coco puff.

132.

CHARLIE

A what?

HUGH

Millions of dollars hang in the

balance.

CHARLIE

They hang on the consumption of a

300 dollar bag of cocaine.

HARLING MAYS

Okay Whip, just two small whiffs

first...one on each side...just a

primer.

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

Atta boy, head back now. Swallow.

Water, chief, you! Water.

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

(snaps his fingers)

Coco puff...

133.

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

Little coco puff buddy. C'mon

banana man. Who's the banana man?

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

Good man, focus up big dog. Here's

the train comin' to you.

HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)

(still holding the smoke)

Keep it down big dog, banana boat's

comin' tell me the banana boat's

comin'...

WHIP

The banana boat is here.

HARLING MAYS

Nothing can keep you down dog.

Nothing keeps the big dog down.

CHARLIE

Okay, we gotta go.

HARLING MAYS

You guys are up.

HUGH

No, I'm good. Charlie?

CHARLIE

Are you fucking crazy?

WHIP

Thanks brother, I'm back.

134.

HARLING gathers his things, stands and hugs WHIP.

HARLING MAYS

I love you man.

WHIP

I love you too.

HUGH and CHARLIE are quiet as they watch the strange but

sincere drug-fueled emotion pass between two old friends.

HARLING eyes CHARLIE before handing him a baggie.

HARLING MAYS

There's a gram in here, you paid

for it and he might need it. My

work here is done. See you all on

the dark side of the moon.

HARLING leaves and our TRIO exchange looks, "Did that just

happen?"

EXT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- GUEST HALLWAY -- DAY

just before we see WHIP step out of the hotel room and begin

a relatively steady strut down the hallway. Deja Vu.

Sunglasses on, WHIP is backed by HUGH and CHARLIE who flank

him from a few steps behind. Further back we can see that

OFFICER EDWARDS also exits the room wearing latex gloves,

carrying a large plastic garbage bag that obviously holds any

evidence of the debauched night or the morning's

resurrection.

INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- ELEVATOR -- DAY

WHIP, HUGH and CHARLIE ride the elevator. WHIP is buttoning

his shirt and fixing his tie. It is miraculous how the coke

has revived him. A MOM and her 8 year old DAUGHTER get on

the elevator.

CHARLIE

Morning.

We watch as a small trickle of blood escapes from WHIP's left

nostril. HUGH pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, hands it

to WHIP.

HUGH

Your nose...

WHIP accepts the handkerchief and wipes his nose. WHIP sees

blood on the cloth and tilts his head back.

135.

HUGH

I'm gonna head in and tell Ellen

Block that we're here.

CHARLIE

You're gonna make it. Remember, if

they ask about your drinking, it's

totally acceptable to say, "I don't

recall."

WHIP

Do not tell me how to lie about my

drinking. I've been lying about my

drinking my whole life.

ELLEN BLOCK

Those are difficult images to

watch. For the record, I'm Ellen

Block, Hearing Officer for this

hearing. Captain Whitaker, good

morning.

136.

WHIP

Morning.

ELLEN BLOCK

What was captured on that video is

that the aircraft was in a

relatively stable glide just prior

to the moment of impact.

However, according to the data we

retrieved from the cockpit data

recorders, at exactly 9:34, after

flying 27 minutes without incident,

the transponder recorded a loss in

altitude in excess of 4800 feet per

minute in what is considered a

"full pitch nose down" attitude.

Then at 9:42, according to the data

recorders, a decision was made to

invert the aircraft. The NTSB has

created animated simulation that I

would like to play at this point.

ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)

That audio is tragic and

compelling. I chose to play that

part of the cockpit recording to

highlight a key moment aboard

flight 227, wherein you say "We're

gonna roll it, here we go, I've got

control." You made a very

conscious decision to invert the

airplane, to roll the plane upside

down. Is that correct?

137.

WHIP

I'm not sure it was conscious. It

was more of an instinct.

ELLEN BLOCK

What led to that decision?

WHIP

I don't recall.

ELLEN BLOCK

Let me quote from an investigative

summary..."From 9:34 until 9:42 the

events on the aircraft are"...again

I quote, "bold and remarkable"...

"By inverting the plane, Captain

Whitaker arrested the descent and

allowed the aircraft to level off

enabling him to glide the aircraft

away from any populated areas and

allowing him to execute a forced

landing in an open field.

WHIP

I heard a metallic bang. We

pitched nose down. No control.

ELLEN BLOCK

You had no idea what was wrong with

the aircraft?

WHIP

There was a lot of things wrong

with that aircraft.

ELLEN BLOCK

As I said before you can add any

details you like to any comments I

make. Do you remember any thing

else that was out of the ordinary?

Did you feel the flight crew was in

their best shape?

138.

WHIP

Yes.

ELLEN BLOCK

It was raining very hard the

morning you took off, wasn't it?

WHIP

There was some convective activity

in the area. However, my first

officer and I discussed the

conditions on the field and

determined that we were safely

within our visibility and crosswind

minimums.

ELLEN BLOCK

Yes, first officer Evans' testimony

confirms the same.

ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)

I want to show you something.

ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)

Nothing's happening.

ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)

This remote is not working.

Apologies. I can do it manually.

ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)

This is the jackscrew on the tail

assembly which articulates the

horizontal stabilizer--also known

as the elevator. As you can see,

the threads on this screw are

almost entirely gone. "

139.

Substandard thread life" is how we

reported it. This part was

suggested as a maintenance

replacement in January of 2010. It

was never replaced.

This had 1200 additional hours of

flight on it. It finally failed.

ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)

Our investigators have concluded

that the jackscrew snapped and the

elevator was frozen in a fixed

position, locking the elevator in a

down position which forced the

plane into a dive. The loss of the

elevator was, and I quote our

report, a "catastrophic event, from

which recovery was improbable and

stable flight impossible."

ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)

Again I quote..."From 9:34 until

9:42 the piloting decisions made by

Captain Whitaker were bold and

remarkable. The fact that Captain

Whitaker commanded that the

aircraft stay inverted while

descending to an extremely low

altitude shows a miraculous

intuition that in this instance

saved 96 lives."

WHIP

I appreciate that.

140.

ELLEN BLOCK

Mr. Whitaker, I want to talk about

the days leading and hours leading

up to the accident. But before I

do, I want to remind you that you

are under oath and any testimony

that you give here today will be

considered admissable in any

subsequent hearings or criminal

proceedings, do you understand what

that means?

ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)

Captain Whitaker, for the record I

need you to verbalize your answer.

WHIP

Yes, I understand.

ELLEN BLOCK

On the three days leading up to the

day of the accident -- Tuesday,

October 11th, Wednesday, October

12th or Thursday, October 13th of

2011 -- did you consume any alcohol

or other intoxicating elements?

WHIP

No. I did not.

ELLEN BLOCK

On the morning of the accident,

Friday, October 14th, did you

consume any alcohol or ingest any

chemicals or drugs that may have

impaired your ability to perform

your job?

141.

WHIP

No. I did not.

ELLEN BLOCK

Mr. Whitaker, do you now or have

you ever had a problem with alcohol

dependency, alcoholism or drug

addiction?

WHIP

No.

ELLEN BLOCK

Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about

done.

(She refers to her notes)

Due to the severe turbulence during

the early part of the flight, you

asked the flight crew to suspend

the beverage service on the plane.

Is that correct?

WHIP

Yes. I suspended the drink

service.

ELLEN BLOCK

Are you aware that our

investigators found two single-

service Vodka bottles in the galley

trash bin?

WHIP

Yes.

ELLEN BLOCK

There were 5 crew members on board

the flight who would have had

access to the beverage trolley.

Less than an hour after the

accident, blood was taken from each

of the crew members. Yourself...

142.

ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)

First Officer Evans, flight

attendant Margaret Thomason and

posthumously from Camelia Satou and

Katerina Marquez.

ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)

A toxicology analysis was performed

and three of these tests came back

negative, one was disqualified for

technical reasons...

ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)

And one tested positive for

alcohol. It registered a .17 blood

alcohol level. Are you aware of

that?

WHIP

I am now.

ELLEN BLOCK

Miss Marquez was not only a

colleague, but you knew her outside

of work? Correct?

WHIP

Outside of work? Not really.

ELLEN BLOCK

Did you know Miss Marquez had a

drinking problem?

WHIP

No. I did not.

ELLEN BLOCK

Did you ever see her drink to

excess?

WHIP

No. I did not.

143.

ELLEN BLOCK

Did you know that she was twice

treated for alcohol addiction? The

last time was 16 months ago and

paid for by SouthJet Airlines?

WHIP

No. I did not.

ELLEN BLOCK

Is it your opinion that Katerina

Marquez drank the vodka on the

plane?

WHIP

Can you repeat the question?

ELLEN BLOCK

Your opinion Captain. Is it your

opinion that Katerina Marquez drank

on that flight?

WHIP

I'm sorry. My what...

ELLEN BLOCK

Since her toxicology report is the

only toxicology report that is

admissable in this hearing, and she

in fact tested positive for

alcohol, is it your opinion that

Katerina Marquez drank those 2

bottles of vodka on the flight?

ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)

I'm sorry Mr. Whitaker, I couldn't

hear you. What did you say?

WHIP

I SAID...God help me...

144.

ELLEN BLOCK

Yes, well. However, is it your

opinion...

WHIP

(EXCESSIVELY LOUD)

IT'S MY OPINION...

(lowers his voice)

It's my opinion...

Trina DID NOT...drink the vodka.

ELLEN BLOCK

Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker...

WHIP

(softly, to himself)

She saved that boy's life...

ELLEN BLOCK

Captain Whitaker can you speak

LOUDER-

WHIP

(LOUD AGAIN)

I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SHE DID NOT

DRINK THAT VODKA...

WHIP (CONT'D)

...because I did. I drank the

vodka.

CHARLIE

OBJECTION!!!

NTSB OFFICER #2

Please be seated sir. This is not a

court room.

145.

WHIP

I drank the vodka bottles on the

plane.

ELLEN BLOCK

Mr. Whitaker, in light of that

remark, would you like to

readdress...

WHIP

You don't have to readdress

anything. I DRANK THE VODKA!

ELLEN BLOCK

On the three nights before the

accident, October 11th-

WHIP

On October 11th, 12th and 13th and

14th I was intoxicated. I drank

alcohol on all of those days. I

drank to excess.

ELLEN BLOCK

Mr. Whitaker, on the morning of

OCTOBER-

WHIP

I was drunk. I'm drunk right now,

Miss Block...I'm drunk right...

(Whip finally breaks down)

I'm drunk now, because...

Because I'm an alcoholic.

WHIP (V.O.)

That was it...I was done. It's as

if I'd hit my life long limit for

lies.

146.

WHIP

I could not tell one more lie. And

maybe I'm a sucker. Because if I

had just told one more lie? I could

have walked away from that whole

mess and kept my wings and my false

sense of pride and most importantly

I would have avoided being locked

up here with all of you nice folks

for the last 13 months.

WHIP (CONT'D)

It looks like I will serve every

day of the remaining 4 plus years

of my sentence. And that's fair.

I betrayed the public trust. I

did. That's what the judge

explained to me. I had betrayed

the public trust. The FAA took my

license. And that's fair. The

chances of me flying again are slim

to none. And I accept that.

WHIP

I've had time to think about all of

it. Doing a lot of writing. I've

written letters to each of the

families that lost loved ones on my

flight. Some were able to hear my

apology, some never will.

I've also apologized to all the

people who tried to help me along

the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't

listen, like my wife, I mean my ex

wife...

(he gets emotional)

...and my son. Again, some were

able to forgive me...some never

will.

(COLLECTS HIMSELF)

But at least I'm sober, and I'm

grateful for that.

147.

WHIP (CONT'D)

And this is gonna sound really

stupid coming from a man who's in

prison...but for the first time in

my life...I'm free.

GUARD

Whitaker, you got a visitor.

GUARD

You have 40 minutes.

WHIP

Knuckles, you're looking good.

(BEAT)

I sent you something for your

birthday.

WILL

Yeah. I got it.

148.

WHIP

This is a real surprise; a great

surprise. I haven't seen you-

WILL

College counselor thought I should

come and interview you.

WHIP

Great. An interview. Okay.

WILL

I'm writing essays for college

applications.

WHIP

Listen Will, it means everything to

me that you came here. You are an

amazing kid and you deserve great

things...

WILL

So can you help me with this essay?

WHIP

Yeah. Of course.

WILL

This essay. I have to do an essay

called, "the most fascinating

person I've never met."

WHIP

And that's me?

WILL

Can we pick up where we left off?

149.

WHIP

Okay.

WILL

Who are you?

WHIP

Good question.
