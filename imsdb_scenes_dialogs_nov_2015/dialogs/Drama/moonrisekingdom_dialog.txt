RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)

In order to show you how a big symphony

orchestra is put together, Benjamin

Britten has written a big piece of music,

which is made up of smaller pieces that

show you all the separate parts of the

orchestra.

NARRATOR

This is the island of New Penzance.

Sixteen miles long. Forested with old-

growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by

shallow tidal creeks. An important

seabird habitat. There are no paved roads

but instead many miles of intersecting

foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry

that runs twice daily from Stone Cove.

The year is 1965. We are on the far edge

of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the

ferocious and well-documented storm which

will strike from the east on the fifth of

September -- in three day's time.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Morning, Gadge.

GADGE

Morning, sir.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Deluca. Latrine inspection.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Good.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Roosevelt. How's that lanyard coming?

ROOSEVELT

(FRUSTRATED)

I don't know. I think I skipped a stitch.

INSERT:

4.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Skotak. What's all this lumber for?

SKOTAK

(CHEERILY)

We're building a tree house.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

That's not a safe altitude.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Why's it up so high? If somebody falls --

it's a guaranteed death.

SKOTAK

Well, where would you've built it?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

(PAUSE)

Lower!

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Nickleby. Spot check.

5.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Your socks are down. Your shirt-tails are

untucked. Your trousers are not properly

pressed. You are reported for uniform

violation!

SCOUT MASTER WARD

How many rockets you up to, Panagle?

PANAGLE

Sixteen and a half.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

(TO GADGE)

That enough for the Jubilee?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Izod, go fetch another pint of gun-powder

from the armory shed.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Redford! Halt!

REDFORD

Safety-test, sir.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

(BRISTLING)

Come again?

REDFORD

The vehicle appears to be in good working

order. I'm just checking if --

6.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

(ANGRILY)

Reckless cycling. Second warning. Next

time, I take away the keys.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Morning, Chef.

INSERT:

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Who's missing?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Shakusky! Breakfast!

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Lazy-Eye.

7.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Shakusky? You in there?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

It's zipped from the inside.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Sam?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Jiminy Cricket. He flew the coop.

8.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Watch my line, Edgar.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Hello? This is Captain Sharp. Over.

SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)

Captain Sharp, this is Randall Ward over

at Camp Ivanhoe. Over.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Morning, Randy. What can I do for you?

Over.

SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)

I'm not sure, exactly. I've got an

escaped Khaki Scout. Over.

CAPTAIN SHARP

What does that mean? Over.

SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)

One of my boys seems to have stolen a dug-

out and some fishing tackle, ten pounds

(MORE)

9.

SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.) (cont'd)

of sundries, two bedrolls, plus an air

rifle -- and disappeared. Over.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Any idea why? Over.

SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)

No. He left me a letter of resignation.

Over.

INSERT:

PENCILED SCRAWL:

Dear Scout Master Ward, I am very sad

to inform you I can no longer be involved

with the Khaki Scouts of North America.

The rest of the troop will probably be

glad to hear this. It is not your fault.

Best wishes, Sam Shakusky.

CAPTAIN SHARP

I guess we better notify his folks. Over.

SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)

OK. Over and out.

BECKY

Hello, Diane.

10.

OPERATOR (V.O.)

Becky, I have your person-to-person from

Chesterfield.

BECKY

Hold the line, please.

BECKY

Go ahead, Chesterfield.

TELEPHONE:

MR. BILLINGSLEY

Hello?

CAPTAIN SHARP

Hello, sir. This is Captain Sharp.

MR. BILLINGSLEY

Yes, sir. I received your message. Thank

you very much. In fact, we've come to a

decision, as a family, because this is

only the most recent incident involving

Sam's troubles, and it's just not fair to

the others, so, unfortunately -- we can't

invite him back, at this time.

CAPTAIN SHARP

There's no cause for alarm, sir. We'll

find him. We're just notifying you as a

matter of protocol and so on.

MR. BILLINGSLEY

I understand that. I'm notifying you of

the situation on my end.

CAPTAIN SHARP

I'm confused by that statement. You can't

invite him back?

11.

MR. BILLINGSLEY

I'm afraid not. He's a good boy, he's got

a good heart, but it's just not fair to

the others, you see? He's emotionally

disturbed.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Am I speaking to Sam's father?

MR. BILLINGSLEY

No, sir. Sam's parents passed away a

number of years ago. We're Mr. and Mrs.

Billingsley. We're foster parents. Sam's

been with us since last June.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Excuse me, sir. This is Scout Master Ward

speaking. Are you implying Sam's an

orphan?

MR. BILLINGSLEY

Well, it's a known fact. Of course, he

is.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Why the hell doesn't it say that in the

register? Excuse my language.

MR. BILLINGSLEY

I don't know. What register?

INSERT:

MR. BILLINGSLEY

We sent him a letter. It should reach you

presently.

12.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Mr. Billingsley, I've got an escaped

Khaki Scout. We're notifying you as a

matter of protocol. You say you can't

invite him back? You say he's an orphan?

Well, I don't understand how that works.

(TOTALLY CONFUSED)

What am I supposed to do with him?

MR. BILLINGSLEY

That's up to Social Services. They'll be

in touch with you. They'll look after

Sam. Good luck to you.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

You have your orders. Use the

orienteering and path-finding skills

you've been practicing all summer. Let's

find our man and bring him safely back to

camp. Remember: this isn't just a search

party, it's a chance to do some first-

class scouting. Any questions?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Lazy-Eye.

LAZY-EYE

What's your real job, sir?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

(CAUGHT OFF-GUARD)

I'm a math teacher.

13.

LAZY-EYE

What grade?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

(STIFFENING)

Eighth. Why?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

You know, we're, actually, kind of, in

the middle of something, if you didn't

notice. This is a crisis. Anybody else?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Redford.

REDFORD

What if he resists?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

(HESITATES)

Who?

REDFORD

Shakusky. Are we allowed to use force on

him?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

(IRRITATED)

No, you're not. This is a non-violent

rescue effort. Your instructions are to

find him, not to hurt him. Under any

circumstances. Do I make myself

understood?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Good.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

I'm going to change my answer, in fact.

This is my real job. Scout Master, Troop

55. That's us. I'm proud of that.

14.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Be leery out there. OK, let's get

started. Where's Snoopy?

SKOTAK

Right here.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Give him the scent.

CUT TO:

LAZY-EYE

I heard he ran away because his family

died.

GADGE

I heard he never had any family in the

first place.

DELUCA

That's probably why he's crazy.

REDFORD

I'll tell you one thing: if we find him,

I'm not going to be the one who forgot to

bring a weapon.

NICKLEBY

Me, neither.

MONTAGE:

15.

MR. BISHOP

Camp Ivanhoe? That's all the way across

the other side of the island. You really

think a twelve-year-old boy could row

this far in a canoe?

CAPTAIN SHARP

Most likely not.

MRS. BISHOP

(with a shrug)

It's possible, Counsellor.

MR. BISHOP

(SLIGHTLY IRRITATED)

I disagree, Counsellor. It'd take him

three days, at least.

MRS. BISHOP

I don't think so. Two days, maximum.

MR. BISHOP

Well, I'm not going to argue about it.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Be that as it may, will you let me know

if you see anything unusual?

CUT TO:

16.

INSERT:

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Scout Master's log. September second.

First day of search party for Sam

Shakusky. Morale is extremely low, in

part, I suppose, because Sam is,

unfortunately, the least popular scout in

the troop, by a significant margin. I'm

worried, and I'm confused. Please, let us

find him tomorrow. Please, don't let him

fall off a cliff or drown in the goddamn

lake or something. A terrible day at Camp

Ivanhoe. Let's hope tomorrow's better. In

fact, I'm going to say a prayer.

What kind of bird are you?

BOSSY GIRL

I'm a sparrow, she's a dove, and --

SAM

No, I said, "What kind of bird are you?"

SUZY

I'm a raven.

20.

BOSSY GIRL

Boy's aren't allowed in here.

SAM

I'll be leaving soon.

SAM

What happened to your hand?

SUZY

(PAUSE)

I got hit in the mirror.

SAM

(TAKEN ABACK)

Really. How'd that happen?

SUZY

(SHRUGS)

I lost my temper at myself.

SUZY

What's your name?

SAM

Sam. What's yours?

SUZY

I'm Suzy.

BOSSY GIRL

It's not polite to stare.

MRS. LYNN

Birds! Ready?

Who are you? Where'd you come from? Go

He likes you.

SUZY

(LOOKING AROUND)

I doubt it.

SAM

Good.

SAM

Did you bring a cat?

SAM

Can you read a map?

SUZY

Uh-huh.

SAM

I do cartography.

SAM

I feel we should go halfway today and

halfway tomorrow, since you're a less

experienced hiker, and you're wearing

Sunday-school shoes.

SUZY

OK.

SAM

(pointing on the map)

Here's where we are right now. I'd like

to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred

(which means four o'clock). How does that

sound?

SUZY

Fine.

SAM

You want some beef jerky?

SUZY

OK.

23.

SAM

Let's go.

MONTAGE:

SAM

Are you thirsty?

SUZY

No.

SAM

Well, if your throat gets parched, stick

a pebble in your mouth and suck on it.

You can quench your thirst with the spit,

supposedly.

SAM

Sometimes I stick leaves under my hat. It

cools your head down.

SUZY

That's a good idea. It might help also if

you didn't wear fur.

SAM

(HESITATES)

True, but this adds camouflage.

SAM

Here's a trick. Throw grass in the air,

and you can see which direction the

wind's blowing.

SUZY

Which way?

SAM

Unknown. I guess it doesn't really

matter, as long as we cover our tracks.

24.

SAM

These might be poisonous.

SUZY

(STUDYING THEM)

No, they're huckleberries, in fact. Try

one.

SAM

Not bad. Anyway, they're good for

survival.

SUZY

He knows someone's watching him.

SAM

I agree. Why do you say that?

SUZY

(SQUINTING)

I don't know. I just think he can feel

us.

SAM

You smell like perfume.

SUZY

It's my mother's.

SAM

I brought water, too.

25.

SAM

Should we catch him?

SUZY

(HESITATES)

What for?

SAM

Trout bait. We need worms.

SUZY

(SHARPLY)

No.

SAM

You're right. We'll let him live. Maybe

I've got a licorice whip.

SAM

How strong of a swimmer are you?

SUZY

Pretty good. I broke our school record

for the back-stroke.

SAM

(MILDLY SURPRISED)

OK. Well, I'm not that strong of a

swimmer, so I wear a life-preserver. I

think it's a good policy to get in the

habit, anyway.

SUZY

OK.

INSERT:

CUT TO:

26.

SAM

Watch out for turtles. They'll bite you,

if you put your fingers in their mouths.

Let me see if I can catch this one.

SAM

Somebody wrote on him.

SUZY

The stick's moving!

SAM

(ALERTED)

You got one!

SAM

Fish on hook!

(TO SUZY)

Reel him in! Slowly.

SUZY

Sit down!

GENTLY ENCOURAGING:

SAM

You're doing good.

SAM

This is for fishing.

27.

ENTHUSIASTICALLY:

SUZY

Very good. You know a lot about camping,

don't you?

SAM

(STIFFENING)

I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained

for.

SAM

Anyway, I used to be.

SAM

We can feed your cat the guts and

eyeballs.

SUZY

That's OK. He only eats cat food.

SAM

What else did you bring? We should make

an inventory.

SUZY

OK.

SAM

Go ahead.

28.

SUZY

This is my record player. It works with

batteries. Actually, it belongs to my

little brother Lionel. I left him a note.

Do you like music?

SUZY

This is my favorite record album. My

godmother gave it to me for my birthday.

She lives in France.

SUZY

These are my books. I like stories with

magic powers in them. Either in kingdoms

on earth or on foreign planets. Also,

time-travel, if they make it realistic.

Usually, I prefer a girl hero, but not

always. I couldn't bring all of them

because it got too heavy. You can borrow

any you want.

ITEMS:

SUZY

I also brought my lefty scissors because

I'm left-handed, my toothbrush, some

rubber bands, extra batteries, and my

binoculars, as you know. I forgot my

comb.

SAM

That's it? No mess-kit? No flashlight? No

canteen? No waterproof matches? Didn't

you get the packing list I sent you in my

last letter?

29.

SUZY

(FROWNS)

I thought that's what you're supposed to

bring. I don't own a canteen.

SAM

That's OK. We can share.

SAM

These are all library books. In my school

you're only allowed to check-out one at a

time. Some of these are going to be

overdue.

BLUNTLY:

SAM

Do you steal?

SAM

Why? You're not poor.

SUZY

I might turn some of them back in one

day. I haven't decided yet. I know it's

bad. I think I just took them to have a

secret to keep. Anyway, for some reason,

it makes me feel in a better mood

sometimes.

SAYS SERIOUSLY:

SAM

Are you depressed?

SAM

How come?

30.

SUZY

Well, I can show you an example, if you

want -- but it doesn't make me feel very

good. I found this on top of our

refrigerator.

INSERT:

SAM

Does that mean you?

SUZY

It's not funny.

SAM

To me, it is.

SUZY

You really know how to make friends.

SAM

I'm sorry.

SUZY

That's OK.

SAM

I'm on your side.

31.

SUZY

I know.

SAM

Which one's the best?

CUT TO:

SUZY

His eyes downcast, his kingdom in ruins,

Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the

rippling surface of the cool shallows and

down to its stone floor. "My people once

were lead by a great and noble beast --

and I no longer see his face in this

reflection."

SUZY

Meanwhile, on the Plains of Tabitha,

Francine rested. There would be another

time for war.

ROOM:

MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)

Suzy! Dinner! I'm not going to say it

again!

32.

MRS. BISHOP

Where's your sister?

LIONEL

I don't know, but she borrowed my record

player for ten days without asking.

MRS. BISHOP

(CONFUSED)

What does that mean?

INSERT:

Dear Lionel, I need to use your

record player. I will give it back in

ten days or less. Do not tell Mom.

(Or Dad.) I will replace the batteries

when I return. Signed, Suzy Bishop

BOOMS AGAIN:

MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)

Walt! Where the hell are you?

OUTSIDE:

MR. BISHOP (O.S.)

Right here! Why are you cursing at me?

CUT TO:

MEGAPHONE:

MRS. BISHOP

Does it concern you that your daughter's

just run away from home?

MR. BISHOP

(PAUSE)

That's a loaded question.

33.

MRS. BISHOP

Come down and read this.

BECKY (V.O.)

Scout Master Ward confirms they've had no

luck. They're going home for the --

MR. BISHOP

Who's there?

CAPTAIN SHARP

Good evening. Sorry to startle you. I was

JUST --

MR. BISHOP

(ANGRILY)

What are you doing here? Nobody called

the police.

CAPTAIN SHARP

I know, that's what I'm saying. The

search party's not over yet. In other

WORDS --

MRS. BISHOP

Suzy's missing, too! Go find her.

CAPTAIN SHARP

(HESITATES)

OK. Where'd she --

MR. BISHOP

Wait for me.

34.

HIMSELF:

MR. BISHOP

How can we help her? She's got so many

problems. It's getting worse.

MR. BISHOP

Whose fault is it?

CAPTAIN SHARP

(HESITATES)

I don't know, but just for the record:

ninety-five percent of all runaways

return home within six hours. That

doesn't do you any good right now. It's

just a statistic -- but in all likelihood

Suzy's probably hiding in the closet at

her best friend's house playing Chinese

Checkers at this very moment, as we

speak.

MR. BISHOP

She doesn't have any friends.

CAPTAIN SHARP

(LONG PAUSE)

How's Laura?

MR. BISHOP

(IRRITATED)

How's Laura?

CAPTAIN SHARP

Mrs. Bishop, I mean.

MR. BISHOP

I don't understand.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Is she upset?

CAPTAIN SHARP

I got to get this spot-light fixed.

35.

MRS. BISHOP

She has a pen pal! It's very intimate!

They planned this together!

CAPTAIN SHARP

Sam Shakusky. That's my escaped Khaki

Scout. His family died.

MR. BISHOP

Holy Christ. What am I looking at?

INSERT:

MRS. BISHOP

He does watercolors! Mostly landscapes,

but a few nudes!

SUZY (V.O.)

Dear Sam, Thank you very much. I got

replaced as the raven because I yelled at

Mrs. Lynn. After that I was only a blue

jay, but --

SAM (V.O.)

Dear Suzy, I am sorry your brothers are

so selfish. Maybe they will grow out of

it. Sometimes people do things without

knowing the reasons for --

SUZY (V.O.)

Dear Sam, You are an excellent painter,

especially trees and telephone poles. Is

the girl in the water supposed to be me?

My favorite color is --

SAM (V.O.)

Dear Suzy, I accidentally built a fire

while I was sleep-walking. I have no

memory of this, but my foster parents

think I am lying. Unfortunately, it is --

37.

SUZY (V.O.)

Dear Sam, I am in trouble again because I

threw a rock through the window. My mother

still has glass in her hair. Also --

SAM (V.O.)

Dear Suzy, I have been trying very hard

to make friends, but I feel people do not

like my personality. In fact, I can

understand why they might --

SUZY (V.O.)

Dear Sam, Now I am getting suspended

because I got in a fight with Molly. She

says I go berserk. Our principal is

against me. Why do --

SAM (V.O.)

Dear Suzy, I know your parents hurt your

feelings, but they still love you. That

is more important. If they --

SUZY (V.O.)

Dear Sam, I do think you should think of

their faces every day, even if it makes

you sad. It is too bad they did not leave

you more pictures of themselves. Can you --

SCOUT MASTER WARD

What happened to him?

BECKY

I'm not sure. I think he went searching

in the dark.

MR. BISHOP

She stole the batteries out of my

flashlight.

CAPTAIN SHARP

I think he's onto us.

MRS. BISHOP

(INSTANTLY)

Of course, he is.

BACK:

CAPTAIN SHARP

Of course, he is?

MRS. BISHOP

Of course, he is.

CAPTAIN SHARP

(CONFUSED)

Why aren't we worried about that, then?

MRS. BISHOP

I am.

CAPTAIN SHARP

(ASTONISHED)

Well, I didn't know. Or, anyway, I

thought I was wrong. Did you hit him?

MRS. BISHOP

No. He fell in a ditch.

40.

NICKLEBY

Cat food! I think it's a clue.

BLANKLY:

MR. BISHOP

That's her.

UNEASY:

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Where's he going?

MRS. BISHOP

I don't know.

CAPTAIN SHARP

All right. We know they're together. We

know they're within a certain radius of

this spot. I'm declaring the case with

the county right now. Until help arrives:

CAPTAIN SHARP

I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny

one, and the kid with the curly hair to

come with me in the station wagon. Randy,

you drop-in and head up-river with the

rest of your troop, then split-up on

foot. Becky, call Jed and tell him to

circle over this end of the island and

fly low.

CUT TO:

41.

OMINOUSLY:

SUZY

They found the canoe.

SAM

(angry at himself)

Rats! I should've put more pine needles

on it. Let's go. We're almost there.

SAM

What do you creeps want?

REDFORD

We're looking for you.

SAM

Why?

REDFORD

Because you're a fugitive.

SAM

No, I'm not. Didn't you get my letter of

resignation? I quit the Khaki Scouts.

42.

REDFORD

You're still in uniform.

REDFORD

Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. You

don't have that authority. We've been

deputized. Now are you going to come

along peacefully or not?

SAM

Listen to some reason: I don't like you.

You don't like me. Why don't you stupid

idiots just let us disappear?

REDFORD

(PAUSE)

It's tempting, but I can't allow it.

DELUCA

You shouldn't be friends with him.

SUZY

(OFFENDED)

Why not?

DELUCA

Because he's crazy.

SUZY

(COLDLY)

Maybe you just don't know him.

REDFORD

We know him a lot better than you. He's

emotionally disturbed because his family

died. Nickleby, tie him up.

SAM

Do not cross this stick.

43.

REDFORD

You're doomed, Shakusky.

It was him or us.

SUZY

Oh, no.

They got Snoopy through the neck.

SHE SAYS:

SUZY

He needs a doctor.

SAYS SADLY:

SAM

No, he doesn't. He needs a morgue.

44.

SUZY

(trying to catch her breath)

He's losing blood. Hurry. Where do we go?

MELODRAMA:

SAM

Suzy. Look at me. Snoopy's not going to

make it.

SUZY

(starting to cry)

Don't say that.

SAM

They're after us. We got to move.

SUZY

(raising her voice)

He's dying! We can't just leave him!

SAM

(SHOUTING)

It's too late! He's already gone!

SUZY

(SCREAMING)

Stop yelling at me!

SAM

I'm sorry I had to do that, but you're

panicking. The first rule in any

emergency is you never --

SUZY

Don't ever do that again. No one's

allowed to slap me.

SUZY

You're right. He's dead.

45.

SUZY

Was he a good dog?

SAM

Who's to say -- but he didn't deserve to

die.

POLICE RADIO:

LAZY-EYE

She stabbed Redford in the back with

lefty scissors!

JED (V.O.)

Repeat that, please? Over.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Puncture wound. Lower lumbar. Make room

for a stretcher in the cockpit!

SCOUT MASTER WARD

You're going to be OK. Thank goodness,

she missed the artery. Bite on this.

NICKLEBY

I tried to chop him, but he dodged my

tomahawk.

PANAGLE

Who else got hit?

46.

IZOD

Not me. I ran away when the girl went

berserk.

SKOTAK

He's got great marksmanship. He shot

Deluca in both arms.

SAYS SUDDENLY:

GADGE

Where's Snoopy?

MR. BISHOP

What happened? Who's that? Why's he

bleeding?

CAPTAIN SHARP

Clear the dock, Edgar!

MRS. BISHOP

Is Suzy with you?

GADGE

No, she's in the woods with Shakusky.

JED

Where'm I going?

CAPTAIN SHARP

The infirmary at Fort Lebanon. We'll be

right behind you.

47.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Warm up the motor. I'll be right back.

MR. BISHOP

Hold it right there. You're not leaving

this island. Our daughter's been abducted

by one these beige lunatics.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Walt, it's very clear: the two of them

conspired in this together.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Don't worry, Mr. Bishop. She'll be safe.

Sam's got excellent wilderness skills.

MR. BISHOP

Why can't you control your scouts?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

I'm trying.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Stop.

MRS. BISHOP

Stop it, Walt!

CAPTAIN SHARP

I do blame him --

(pointing to Scout Master Ward)

-- but I also blame myself and both of

you. With all due respect: you can't let

your children stab people.

MRS. BISHOP

(HESITATES)

What are you talking about?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

She's violent, Mrs. Bishop. Look.

MRS. BISHOP

I don't get it. Were there witnesses?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Of course. It's assault.

MRS. BISHOP

I beg your pardon. Are you a lawyer?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

No, ma'am, but --

MRS. BISHOP

(FURIOUS)

Well, I am!

CAPTAIN SHARP

Easy does it. Calm down, Laura.

MR. BISHOP

Stay away from my wife.

NARRATOR (O.S.)

Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me, Captain

Sharp?

NARRATOR

As some of you know, I taught Sam for the

cartography Accomplishment Patch. He's a

smart boy, and he expressed a keen

interest in the history of the island's

indigenous peoples. In particular, I

recall his fascination with the idea of

retracing the original path of the old

Chickchaw harvest migration.

NARRATOR

What I'm getting at is this: I think I

know where they're going.

RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)

Onto the bird-house, where every kind of

bird imaginable is whirling and wheeling

around. This is a real acrobatic act for

our gifted young flute player, Paula

Robeson.

SMILING:

SUZY

This is weird.

SAM

I know!

SAM

On three!

CUT TO:

SUZY

I like it here, but I don't like the

name.

SAM

Me, neither.

51.

SUZY

Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. It's got no ring

to it.

SAM

Let's change it. What should it be?

SUZY

Let me think for a minute.

CUT TO:

SAM

I made you some jewelry.

SAM

Are your ears pierced?

CUT TO:

SUZY

It's pretty. Do the other one.

CUT TO:

SUZY

It feels hard.

52.

SAM

(EMBARRASSED)

Do you mind?

SUZY

I like it.

SAM

(PAUSE)

Tilt your head sideways.

SUZY

You can touch my chest.

SUZY

They're going to grow more.

CUT TO:

SAM

Why do you always use binoculars?

SUZY

It helps me see things closer. Even if

they're not very far away. I pretend it's

my magic power.

SAM

(IMPRESSED)

That sounds like poetry. Poems don't

always have to rhyme, you know. They're

just supposed to be creative.

SAM

What do you want to be? When you grow up.

53.

SUZY

I don't know. I want to go on adventures,

I think. Not get stuck in one place. How

about you?

SAM

(PAUSE)

Go on adventures, too. Not get stuck,

too. I guess that sounds almost like I'm

just repeating what you just said, but I

couldn't think of anything as good as it.

On the other hand, maybe we'll get blown

up by an atom bomb. You can't predict the

exact future.

SUZY

That's true.

SAM

It's possible I may wet the bed, by the

way. Later, I mean.

SUZY

(SURPRISED)

OK.

SAM

(RELUCTANTLY)

I wish I didn't have to mention it, but

just in case. I don't want to make you be

offended.

SUZY

(SOFTLY)

Of course, I won't.

SAM

Some people frown on these problems.

SUZY

What's that one for?

SAM

It's not an accomplishment. I inherited

it from my mother. It's actually not

meant for a male to wear -- but I don't

give a damn.

54.

SUZY

Are your foster parents still mad at you?

For getting in trouble so much.

SAM

I don't think so. We're getting to know

each other better. I feel like I'm in a

family now. Not like yours, but similar

to one.

SUZY

I always wished I was an orphan. Most of

my favorite characters are. I think your

lives are more special.

SAM

I love you, but you don't know what

you're talking about.

SUZY

I love you, too.

CUT TO:

SUZY

The flashlight's beam drew a moon through

the black across the attic and settled on

a gap in the base-board. A mouse-hole, no

bigger than a pocket-watch. Eric crouched

on his flat feet and placed his hand in

front of the tiny opening. "It's windy,"

he said. "Like someone in there's blowing

on my fingers." Christy rolled her eyes

and sighed a sigh. He's right again, she

thought. Little brothers drive people

crazy.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Strike this camp.

SKOTAK

How long were you planning to stay there?

SAM

I don't know.

MURRAY

You said ten days or less.

SUZY

That was a lie.

GADGE

Didn't you ever think about what would

happen next?

SAM

Not to my recollection.

LIONEL

You're a traitor to our family.

SUZY

Good. I want to be.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

What do I do about this?

CAPTAIN SHARP

Give him his mail.

SUZY

What does it say?

57.

SAM

(PUZZLED)

They can't invite me back.

SUZY

(OUTRAGED)

Why not?

SAM

(UPSET)

I gave them too much aggravation.

SUZY

Let me read it.

SUZY

That's child abuse.

MR. BISHOP

Be advised: the two of you will never see

each other again. Those were your last

words. Do you understand?

SUZY

(DARKLY)

I'd be careful if I were you. One of

these days somebody's going to be pushed

too far, and who knows what they're

capable of.

MR. BISHOP

(HESITATES)

Is that a threat?

SUZY

(SIMPLY)

It's a warning.

58.

SUZY

I wish I knew what makes you tick.

MR. BISHOP

(HESITATES)

I beg your pardon?

MRS. BISHOP

Please, terminate this conversation.

MR. BISHOP

(TO LIONEL)

She's saying that to me?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

I'm sorry about this. I didn't know your

situation. It's not on the register.

How'd you lose your parents? I shouldn't

ask that. Never mind. I wish we had time

for an inspection back there. On the

beach. I would've given you a

"commendable". That was one of the best-

pitched camp-sites I've ever seen.

Honestly.

VOICE:

SCOUT MASTER WARD

You don't want to be a Khaki Scout

anymore?

Hello, Becky.

BECKY

Judy, I have your person-to-person from

New Penzance.

OPERATOR (V.O.)

Go ahead, New Penzance.

CUT TO:

CAPTAIN SHARP

Hello? This is Captain Sharp.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Hello, Captain Sharp. This is Social

Services. I'm calling in reference to Sam

Shakusky, Ward of the State. I understand

he's in your custody.

CAPTAIN SHARP

That's correct.

SOCIAL SERVICES

What's his condition? Has he suffered any

injury or trauma of any kind?

CAPTAIN SHARP

He's OK.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Very good. How do I get to you?

CAPTAIN SHARP

The fastest way is by seaplane. Jed can

bring you in with the mail.

SOCIAL SERVICES

I'll come tomorrow morning, if that's

acceptable to you. Is someone able to

(MORE)

60.

SOCIAL SERVICES (cont'd)

provide reasonable care and nourishment

for the boy until that time?

CAPTAIN SHARP

Uh-huh.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Is that a yes?

CAPTAIN SHARP

Uh-huh.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Very good. I'll contact you again before

the end of the day.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Wait a second.

SOCIAL SERVICES

(HESITATES)

Yes?

CAPTAIN SHARP

Social Services?

SOCIAL SERVICES

(EVENLY)

Captain Sharp.

CAPTAIN SHARP

(ANXIOUS)

What's going to happen to him?

SOCIAL SERVICES

Well, normally, we'd try to place him in

another foster home, but that option is

no longer available to us, in my opinion,

with his case history -- which means

he'll go to Juvenile Refuge.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

What's that? An orphanage?

61.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Who's speaking?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

This is Scout Master Ward.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Right. An orphanage -- but the first step

is the admissions panel requires a

psychological evaluation to determine

whether or not the boy's a candidate for

institutional treatment or electroshock

therapy. Beyond that --

CAPTAIN SHARP

(INTERRUPTING)

Excuse me. Shock therapy? Why would that

be necessary? He's not violent.

SOCIAL SERVICES

The report describes an assault with

scissors.

CAPTAIN SHARP

(OBJECTING)

That was the girl! Who did that.

SOCIAL SERVICES

(PAUSE)

Well, maybe she needs help, too -- but

that's not our job. OK?

CAPTAIN SHARP

(LONG PAUSE)

OK.

62.

MR. BISHOP

I'll be out back.

MR. BISHOP

I'm going to find a tree to chop down.

MRS. BISHOP

I do know what you're feeling, Suzy-bean.

I've had moments myself where I say: what

am I doing here? Who made this decision?

How could I allow myself to do something

so stupid --

(WITH FEELING)

-- and why is it still happening? We

women are more emotional. You have to

REMEMBER --

SUZY

I hate you.

MRS. BISHOP

(HESITATES)

Don't say "hate".

SUZY

Why not? I mean it.

MRS. BISHOP

You think you mean it. In this moment.

You're trying to hurt me.

63.

SUZY

Exactly.

(PAUSE)

I know what you do with that sad, dumb

police man. You go to bed with him.

MRS. BISHOP

He's not dumb, but I guess he is kind of

sad. Anyway, we shouldn't discuss that.

It's not appropriate for me to even

acknowledge what I already just said.

MRS. BISHOP

Poor Suzy. Why is everything so hard for

you?

SHE SAYS:

SUZY

We're in love. We just want to be

together. What's wrong with that?

MRS. BISHOP

Oh, my God. How are we going to get these

fish-hooks out?

SAM

I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That

part's true. We knew people would be

worried, and we still ran away, anyway --

but something also happened which we

didn't do on purpose. When we first met

each other. Something happened to us.

64.

SERIOUSLY:

CAPTAIN SHARP

I agree with you. That's eloquent. I

can't argue against anything you're

saying -- but I don't have to, because

you're twelve years old.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Look, let's face it, you're probably a

much more intelligent person than I am.

In fact, I guarantee it -- but even smart

kids sometimes stick their fingers in

electrical sockets, if you see what I

mean. It takes time to figure things out.

It's been proven by history: all mankind

makes mistakes. It's our job to try to

protect you from the dangerous ones. If

we can.

CAPTAIN SHARP

You want a slug?

CAPTAIN SHARP

What's the rush? You've got your whole

life in front of yourself. Ahead of you,

I mean.

SAM

(SHRUGS)

Maybe so. Anyway, you're a bachelor.

CAPTAIN SHARP

(DEFENSIVE)

What does that have to do with it? So are

you.

SAM

(SADLY)

That's true. Did you love someone ever?

65.

CAPTAIN SHARP

(PAUSE)

Yes, I did.

SAM

What happened?

CAPTAIN SHARP

She didn't love me back.

SAM

Ah.

CAPTAIN SHARP

I'm sorry for your loss. Anyway, that's

what people say.

SAM

Thanks.

CAPTAIN SHARP

What happened?

SAM

A drunk truck driver smashed into them.

CAPTAIN SHARP

(PAINED)

Good grief.

Z's!

GADGE

I heard he's going to reform school.

DELUCA

I heard they're going to take out a piece

of his brain and send him to an insane

asylum.

ROOSEVELT

I like his girl.

PANAGLE

She's too scruffy for me.

NICKLEBY

Supposedly, they got to third base.

LAZY-EYE

That's not true. He just felt her up.

ROOSEVELT

(DEEPLY INTRIGUED)

Over-shirt or under-shirt?

ANGRILY:

SKOTAK

Damn us.

SKOTAK

This troop has been very shabby to Field

Mate Sam Shakusky. In fact, we've been a

bunch of mean jerks. Why's he so

unpopular? I admit, supposedly, he's

(MORE)

67.

SKOTAK (CONT'D)

emotionally disturbed -- but he's also a

disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?

HE ASKS:

SKOTAK

Nickleby? Deluca? Lazy-Eye?

(from the heart)

Gadge?

WITH FEELING:

SKOTAK

He's a fellow Khaki Scout, and he needs

our help. Are we man enough to give that?

So part of his brain doesn't get removed

out of him.

SKOTAK

They were prepared to die for each other

out there.

DELUCA

What do you need?

SKOTAK

(EXCITED)

For starters? Three yards of chicken

wire, some ripped-up newspapers, and a

bucket of wheatpaste.

68.

CAPTAIN SHARP

In other words, it's over.

MRS. BISHOP

I guess so. For the moment.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Until further notice.

MRS. BISHOP

That's right.

CAPTAIN SHARP

I understand.

MRS. BISHOP

I've got to do better. For everybody.

CAPTAIN SHARP

Except me.

MRS. BISHOP

Except you.

CAPTAIN SHARP

(SINCERELY)

Well, I hope you can. I think you will.

You're doing the right thing.

MRS. BISHOP

Who know what's going to happen, Duffy?

I'll probably see you tomorrow.

CAPTAIN SHARP

(CALMLY)

No, you won't.

69.

CAPTAIN SHARP

I admire them, you know? There's a purity

to it. I only feel bad because they both

seem like such unhappy, lonely, miserable

people -- but maybe that's romantic.

MRS. BISHOP

(PUZZLED)

I don't see it that way.

WHISPERS SHARPLY:

SAM

Get out of my chimney.

SKOTAK

Listen to me. We're here for friendship.

We're going to get you off this island.

No, thanks.

SKOTAK

Yes, thanks. This is an emergency rescue.

SAM

It's worthless to me. There's no point.

Not without Suzy.

SAM

How'd you get here?

SUZY

They snuck me down the laundry chute and

left a paper-mache dummy in my bed.

SAM

(IMPRESSED)

Diversion tactics. Good thinking.

CUT TO:

SAM (V.O.)

Where we going?

SKOTAK (V.O.)

Fort Lebanon. My cousin Ben runs the

Supply and Resources outpost for the

Jubilee. He's a Falcon Scout,

Legionnaire. Cousin Ben'll know what to

do.

SAM (V.O.)

Can we trust him?

SKOTAK (V.O.)

Normally, I'd say no.

SAM

Did you leave another note for Lionel?

SUZY

Not this time. He can't keep his trap

shut. Besides, I'll probably never see

him again.

SAM

That's true.

for leniency? Rogers vs. Yentob.

MRS. BISHOP

He granted it.

MR. BISHOP

Great.

MRS. BISHOP

I'm sorry, Walt.

MR. BISHOP

It's not your fault. Which injuries are

you apologizing for? Specifically.

MRS. BISHOP

Specifically? Whichever ones still hurt.

MR. BISHOP

(WISTFULLY)

Half of those were self-inflicted.

MR. BISHOP

I hope the roof flies off, and I get

sucked up into space. You'll be better

off without me.

MRS. BISHOP

Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

MR. BISHOP

Why?

MRS. BISHOP

We're all they've got, Walt.

DAWNING REALIZATION:

MR. BISHOP

It's not enough.

SUZY

"-- but I'm not going," said Barnaby

Jack. "I'm running away tonight for good,

and this time I won't get caught."

Annabelle whispered: "I'm coming with

you." Her yellow hair, now brown at the

roots, caught up in the wind and danced.

Barnaby Jack took Annabelle's hand and

pressed something into it the size of a

jellybean. "Hide this in your socks, and

be ready at midnight."

SUZY

He leapt out the window and landed in the

fresh-fallen snow.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

COUSIN BEN

Is this him?

SAM

Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55,

COUSIN BEN

He's hot. Almost too hot. What's in the

SKOTAK

Seventy-six dollars -- but it's mostly in

nickels.

COUSIN BEN

Give it to me.

77.

COUSIN BEN

You badge in seamanship?

SAM

Yes, sir.

COUSIN BEN

Good. There's cold-water crabber moored

off Broken Rock. The skipper owes me an

I.O.U. We'll see if he can take you on as

a claw cracker. It won't be an easy life,

but it's better than shock therapy.

SAM

Thank you, sir. By the way, where's the

chapel tent?

COUSIN BEN

Back there, but the padre's home with the

mumps. Why do you ask?

SAM

I want to bring my wife.

BEHIND HIM:

SUZY

But we're not married yet.

COUSIN BEN

You his girl?

COUSIN BEN

Technically, I'm a civil-law scrivener.

I'm authorized to declare births, deaths,

and marriages. You're kind of young. You

got a license?

78.

COUSIN BEN

I can't offer you a legally binding

union. It won't hold up in the state, the

county, or, frankly, any courtroom in the

world due to your age, lack of a license,

and failure to get parental consent --

but the ritual does carry a very

important moral weight within yourselves.

You can't enter into this lightly. Do you

love each other?

COUSIN BEN

Are you sure you're ready for this?

COUSIN BEN

Let me rephrase it.

SUZY

(INTERRUPTING)

We're in a hurry.

COUSIN BEN

(SNAPPING)

Spit out the gum, sister. In fact,

everybody.

SAYS STERNLY:

COUSIN BEN

I don't like the snappy attitude. This is

the most important decision you've made

in your lives. Now go over by that

trampoline and talk it through before you

give me another quick answer.

I guess we better try to pretend we're

struggling over our decision for a minute

before we go back over there and tell him --

SUZY

Maybe he's right. It could be a mistake.

What? Why? How?

SUZY

Being married. Sometimes it seems sad to

me. It might be better to just go steady

permanently.

QUIETLY:

SAM

I don't know what to say.

COUSIN BEN

I guess they're probably just trying to

SCOUT MASTER WARD

We're going back out. I need volunteers.

92.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

You, you, you, you --

SCOUT MASTER WARD

-- and you?

BECKY

Are you all right?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

(WARMLY)

Of course, I am. Come on.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Where's the boy?

CAPTAIN SHARP

We don't know yet.

SOCIAL SERVICES

That's not acceptable.

CAPTAIN SHARP

(pretending to be irritated)

What do you want me to say, lady?

(to no one in particular)

Somebody get Jed a cup of coffee.

93.

SOCIAL SERVICES

You're Captain Sharp?

CAPTAIN SHARP

That's right.

SOCIAL SERVICES

I'm Social Services. I remanded the boy

to your personal custody. You're

responsible for his safety. I'm told he

was just struck by lightning.

SKEPTICALLY:

CAPTAIN SHARP

That's the first I heard of it.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

(UNFORTUNATELY)

It's true.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Scout Master Ward, I presume?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Yes, ma'am.

SOCIAL SERVICES

(BITINGLY)

Your reputation precedes you.

SOCIAL SERVICES

You two are the most appallingly

incompetent custodial guardians Social

Services has ever had the misfortune to

ENCOUNTER --

(SHOUTING)

-- in a twenty-seven year career!

SOCIAL SERVICES

What do you have to say for yourselves?

94.

CAPTAIN SHARP

You can't do this. They'll eat him alive

in there.

SOCIAL SERVICES

(HESITATES)

Where?

CAPTAIN SHARP

(aside, to Scout Master Ward)

What's the name of the place again?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

(HESITATES)

Juvenile refuge?

CAPTAIN SHARP

(HORRIFIED)

Juvenile refuge. That sounds like jail.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Just find the boy -- and deliver him --

(motioning to herself)

-- to Social Services. Nothing else is in

your power.

MR. BISHOP

(SHARPLY)

I'm sorry.

MR. BISHOP

Can we get back to the rescue now?

MRS. BISHOP

(URGENTLY)

Suzy's still out there.

SOCIAL SERVICES

(FROWNING)

Who are you?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Walt and Laura Bishop. Their daughter's

the missing girl.

SOCIAL SERVICES

The parents of the stabber?

95.

MRS. BISHOP

I object to that description. She was

attacked.

COMMANDER PIERCE

I want the details. Where's the scout she

knifed?

SECRETARY MCINTIRE

Right here.

REDFORD

Field Mate Redford, sir.

COMMANDER PIERCE

(through the oxygen mask)

What's his condition?

SECRETARY MCINTIRE

He may suffer some limited chronic kidney

insufficiency. Here's the report.

MRS. BISHOP

We don't have time for this!

SCOUT MASTER WARD

She's right!

SOCIAL SERVICES

Let's go!

CAPTAIN SHARP

Nobody's going anywhere.

CAPTAIN SHARP

He's not getting shock therapy.

96.

SOCIAL SERVICES

That's it! I'm citing you for gross

misconduct! You are hereby summoned to

appear before the board of --

CAPTAIN SHARP

I'm writing you up back! Be notified that

you stand accused of the mistreatment and

IMPROPER --

SOCIAL SERVICES

(SCREAMING)

What are you talking about?

CAPTAIN SHARP

(SCREAMING)

I won't let you do it!

REDFORD

(SCREAMING)

Look!

CAPTAIN SHARP

They're gone.

MR. BISHOP

(CONFUSED)

Who?

MRS. BISHOP

(UNCERTAIN)

Suzy?

97.

CAPTAIN SHARP

(YELLING)

Sam?

SCOUT MASTER WARD

(SHOUTING)

Gadge! Lazy-eye! Skotak!

SOCIAL SERVICES

(REALIZING)

They're here?

CAPTAIN SHARP

Where'd they go? Answer me!

HOLLERS:

CAPTAIN SHARP

Halt! Stop!

CAPTAIN SHARP

Stay there!

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Take this!

98.

CUT TO:

STRAINS:

CAPTAIN SHARP

Where you going? What are you doing? Come

down!

CAPTAIN SHARP

Social Services? Do you read me? Over!

CUT TO:

SUZY

We might have to swim for it.

SAM

How deep is it? I didn't bring my life

jacket.

SUZY

I don't know, but if it's too shallow,

we'll break our necks, anyway. Hang onto

me.

SAM

OK.

99.

CUT TO:

SOCIAL SERVICES (V.O.)

Application denied! I'm sorry! Over!

CAPTAIN SHARP

(FRUSTRATED)

Counsellors? What's the legal

perspective? Over!

CUT TO:

MR. BISHOP

In this state? I would litigate with

extreme confidence.

MRS. BISHOP

(ABSOLUTELY)

I concur.

MRS. BISHOP

(INSPIRED)

Open with article fifteen of the Codes of

Civic Jurisdiction.

MR. BISHOP

(FROM MEMORY)

No party, under any circumstance, shall

be denied due and proper consideration...

Wait. Just in case this is a suicide, or

they capture us, and we never see each

other again anymore -- thank you for

marrying me. I'm glad I got to know you,

Suzy.

SUZY

I think you've still got lightning in

you.

SAM

Let's jump.

CAPTAIN SHARP (O.S.)

No!

CAPTAIN SHARP

Goddammit!

CAPTAIN SHARP

Tell him! Over!

SOCIAL SERVICES (V.O.)

Captain Sharp is offering to assume the

responsibility of foster parenthood!

CUT TO:

SCOUT MASTER WARD

He wants you to live with him!

CUT TO:

101.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky?

CUT TO:

CAPTAIN SHARP

What do you think, pal?

CAPTAIN SHARP

We're coming down! Over and out.

CUT TO:

CAPTAIN SHARP

Don't let go.

CUT TO:

NARRATOR

The Black Beacon storm was considered by

the U.S. Department of Inclement Weather

meteorological event of the second half

of the twentieth century.

NARRATOR

It lingered through six high-tides and

inundated the islands with punishing

winds and extreme high waters.

NARRATOR

On St. Jack Wood, powerful surges broke

the arcade boardwalk and demolished the

village bandstand and casino.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Scout Master's log. October tenth.

Reconstruction continues increasingly

ahead of schedule, which I attribute to a

particularly robust esprit de corps among

the troop. The latrine, however,

continues to present --

SCOUT MASTER WARD

Is this the new recruit?

SKOTAK

Yes, sir.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

What's his rank?

SKOTAK

He doesn't have one.

SCOUT MASTER WARD

(ENTHUSIASTICALLY)

Pigeon Scout! Let's get you a patch.

CONTINUES:

NARRATOR

The coastal areas of New Penzance were

battered and changed forever.

INSERT:

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet was erased from the

NARRATOR

But harvest yields the following autumn

far exceeded any previously recorded, and

the quality of the crops was said to be

extraordinary.

RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)

So you see, the composer Benjamin Britten

has taken the whole orchestra apart. Now

he puts it back together again in a

fugue.

Suzy? Lionel, Murray, Rudy! Dinner!

MR. BISHOP (O.S.)

Don't make us ask twice!

See you tomorrow.
