Andrew Marlow

STRIKE FORCE LEADER

(into headset/in

Russian)

GO!

SOLDIER

(in Russian)

Get up, now!  Up!

VOICE (V.0. RADIO)

Roger, Restitution.  We are standing

by for delivery.

FADE TO BLACK

The SOUNDS of a dinner banquet.

Forks clanking against plates and

the din of a hundred conversations,

broken by...

PETROV

(in Russian)

Thank you for joining us this evening.

TRANSLATOR (V.0.)

Tonight we are honored to have with

us a man of remarkable courage, who,

despite strong international

criticism...

TRANSLATOR

(V.0. earpiece)

Has chosen to join our fight against

tyranny in forging a new world

community.  Ladies and gentlemen, I

give you the President of the United

States of America...

DOHERTY

Maybe we should consider running him

for re-election instead of the U.S.

MARSHALL

(in Russian with

subtitles)

Good evening and thank you.  First I

would ask you to join me in a moment

of silence for the victims of the

Turkmenistan massacres.

MARSHALL

As you know, three weeks ago American

Special Forces, in cooperation with

the Russian Republican Army, secured

the arrest of Turkmenistan's self-

proclaimed dictator, General Ivan

Stravanavitch, whose brutal sadistic

reign had given new meaning to the

word horror.  I am proud to say our

operation was a success.

MARSHALL

And now, yesterday's biggest threat

to world peace... today awaits trial

for crimes against humanity.

MARSHALL

What we did here was important.  We

finally pulled our heads out of the

sand, we finally stood up to the

brutality and said "We've had enough.

Every time we ignore these atrocities--

the rapes, the death squads, the

genocides- every time we negotiate

with these, these thugs to keep them

out of gig country and away from gig

families, every time we do thiS.E.

we legitimize terror.

AIR FORCE ONE

The President's own Boeing 747-200,

dubbed "the flying White House".

The distinctive royal blue stripe

over a thin gold line tapers to a

tail adorned with the American flag

and the Presidential Seal Secret

Service agents and Marines stand

guard at the aircraft's perimeter.

GIBBS

Gentlemen, welcome to Air Force One.

KORSHUNOV

We've already been inspected.

GIBBS

Sir, this plane carries the President

of the United States.

KORSHUNOV

Of course.  I'm sorry.

GIBBS

Please place your thumbs on the ID

pad.

SHEPHERD

*                     CBS said they'll

give us four minutes.  They thought

the Russian was a nice touch.

MARSHALL

I always wondered if my freshman

Russian class would come in handy.

DOHERTY

Sir, you threw out page two.

MARSHALL

Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a

tough-as-nails speech and you gave

me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the

point in having a speech if I have

to ad-lib?

DOHERTY

It was a good ad-lib, sir.

MARSHALL

Thanks.  Wrote it last night.

WALTERS

Equipment checks out.

GIBBS

Gentlemen, this is Maria Mitchell.

KORSHUNOV

Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally

meet you in person.

MITCHELL

The President and I were delighted

that we could accommodate you.  Now

if you're all cleared?

(Gibbs nods)

You can follow me then.

MITCHELL

*                    I'll be giving

you a brief tour, then during the

flight, two members of your crew

will be allowed out of the press

area at a time for filming.  You

will have exactly ten minutes with

the President and twenty with the

crew...

SHEPHERD

You wanna knock of f?

MARSHALL

No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the

Speaker say?

SHEPHERD

He and the NRA don't like the wording.

DOHERTY

Apparently taking uzis away from

sixth graders isn't as popular as we

thought it'd be.  Representative

Taylor is working on a compromise.

MARSHALL

Put together a score sheet.  I'll

make some calls.

SHEPHERD

With all due respect, sir, maybe you

should give them this one.  Your

numbers are still pretty low and you

called in a lot of chips to nail

Stravanavitch.

MARSHALL

I might still have a few chips left.

SHEPHERD

*                     We could always

put you in a duck blind with a twelve

gauge.  The second amendment types'll

love that.

MARSHALL

This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing

a couple ducks won't get it through

committee.  Besides, Shep, I told

you...  I don't shoot babies and I

don't kiss guns.

SHEPHERD

Other way around, sir.

MARSHALL

(realizing what he

said)

Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a

favor and keep me away from the press.

LARRY KING (T.V.)

... and your reaction to the

President's trip to Moscow.  Good or

bad?

SHEPHERD

This is the part I wanted you to

see.

REP. DANFORTH (T.V.)

Criminal.  One of our boys died in

Marshall's little publicity stunt

and for what?  So we could claim

victory over another country's

problems instead of our own?  And

now he's got the nerve to prance

around Moscow gloating, while that

poor boy's family is left to bury

him.  If I were Marshall, I'd be

ashamed of myself.

LARRY KING

There you have it.  Harsh words for

the President from Michael Danforth,

the Speaker of the House.

SHEPHERD

*                     My opinion.

We can't let him get away with that

kind of language.

MARSHALL

It's bait.  Don't take it.

SHEPHERD

Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked

this administration on national

television.  You can't afford to

leave that hanging.

MARSHALL

(ignoring Shepherd)

Did we tape the Duke game?

AIDE

It's waiting on the plane.  The ending

was pretty...

MARSHALL

(interrupting)

Please don't tell me.  Just for once,

*                     let me be

surprised.

MITCHELL

Up on the upper deck is the cockpit

and the Mission Communication Center.

The MCC, as we call it, can place

clear and secure phone calls to

anywhere on earth.  We're linked to

a network of military and civilian

satellites and ground stations.  We

could run the country or run a war

from there if we had to.

KORSHUNOV

This is a remarkable aircraft.

MITCHELL

You don't know the half of it.  Did

you know this entire plane is shielded

from radiation?  We could fly through

a mushroom cloud completely unharmed

if necessary.

KORSHUNOV

A dubious distinction, no?

MITCHELL

I guess it depends on your

perspective.

KORSHUNOV

And all these rooms here?

MITCHELL

Conference rooms, though some have

other functions.  The one up front

doubles as an emergency medical

center.

MITCHELL

As you can see, back here's more

like a regular plane.  Security and

Secret Service take this cabin.

You'll be in the rear with the press

pool.

MITCHELL

Here's a press kit.  I'll let you

guys get comfortable and once we're

airborne I'll be able to schedule

the interviews.

KORSHUNOV

Thank you.

REPORTER

You fellas win some sort of fly-with-

POTUS contest?

KORSHUNOV

Potus?  What is Potus?

REPORTER

P.O.T.U.S. President Of The United

States.

KORSHUNOV

Ah, no.  We won nothing.  We are

ITAR-TASS news service.

REPORTER

Right.  Listen, this here... This is

my row.  You'll have to sit over

there.

COL. AXELROD

Welcome aboard, Mr. President.

MARSHALL

(returns salute)

Hey Danny.  How's it look tonight?

COL. AXELROD

Glassy, sir.  Care to take the wheel?

MARSHALL

You keep offering, one of these days

I'll take you up on it.

(to no one in

particular)

Rose and Alice back yet?

AIDE

No, Mr. President.  The ballet ran

late.  Their ETA is seventeen minutes.

SHEPHERD

Mr. President?

MARSHALL

Thirty seconds.

MARSHALL

Yes.

SHEPHERD

Can I at least issue a press release

objecting to the Speaker's choice of

wording?

MARSHALL

I said it's not worth the fight.

(into phone)

Steward, please.

SHEPHERD

We'll just say it was in bad taste.

SHEPHERD

You give me ulcers.

MARSHALL

That's my job.

STEWARD

Mr. President?

MARSHALL

Hey Mike.  Could you get me a

Heineken?

SHEPHERD

No, wait.  Get him one of the Russian

beers.

SHEPHERD

We've got those Russian news guys on

board and it'll look good in the

papers.

MARSHALL

C'mon Shep.  I've been eating borscht

and drinking vodka for days.  Isn't

that enough?

(off paper)

New home starts are down.

MARSHALL

Fill this with Heineken.

STEWARD

Yes, Mr. President.

MARSHALL

I don't believe this.  I'm playing

politics with a bottle of beer.  A

goddamn bottle of beer.  I've been

in office too long.

SHEPHERD

Look on the bright side... if the

polls don't change, you won't have

that problem, sir.

MARSHALL

Yeah.  Put the Duke game on in my

room.

AIR FORCE SPECIALIST

Yes, Mr. President.

MARSHALL

(to Shepherd)

Defense and State Department in the

conference room in one hour.  I want

to review the Iraq situation.

SHEPHERD

Yes, sir.

MARSHALL

Get me the Housing Secretary...

ROSE

C'mon Alice, we're 20 minutes late.

ALICE

It's not like he hasn't made us wait

a few times.

ROSE

Well, you aren't the President, dear.

ALICE

Yeah, no duh.

ROSE

Why don't you go say hi?

ROSE

What is wrong with you tonight?

Come here.

ROSE

You don't want to say hi to your

father?

ALICE

I'm sure he's busy.

ROSE

Don't you even want to ask?

ALICE

If I go over there to say hi to daddy

President, Mike's going to tell me

he's in a meeting and can't be

disturbed.  Then when the plane starts

to taxi, he'll come out and say "Hey,

are you guys back?  Did you enjoy

the ballet?"  But he'll be on his

way to another meeting and won't

wait for an answer.  Then you'll get

pissed at him and he'll get pissed

at you.  It's like you guys rehearse

or something.

ALICE

Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double

whip cream.

ROSE

Alice...

ALICE

Mom, just this once, give it a rest.

ROSE

You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about

this back...

ALICE

Back at The Fishbowl?

ROSE

We'll talk at home.

(beat)

You know, most girls aren't as lucky

as you.  For most girls seeing the

Bolshoi ballet would be the experience

of a lifetime.

ALICE

I know, Mom.

(sees the hurt in her

mom's eyes and softens)

It was great... really.

ALICE

He's in a meeting.  He can't be

disturbed.

ROSE

I'm sorry, honey.

ALICE

No, it's okay.  After all, he is the

President, right?

ALICE

When I write my memoirs I think I'll

devote an entire chapter to the cocoa

aboard Air Force One.

ROSE

Your father never means to be so...

ALICE

I know...

(beat)

But lotsa times I feel like it's me

versus the world.  Some kid at school

teases me and the same day a plague

breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it

doesn't take a genius to figure which

is more important.

ROSE

Some kids were teasing you?

ALICE

That's not really the point.

ROSE

You're right and I'll tell you a

secret.  I know exactly how you feel.

ALICE

Big secret.  You said the same thing

to Newsweek.

ALICE

We're taxiing.  Ready.  And... five...

four... three.. two... one... Cue

Daddy.

ALICE

Oooooh, I'm good.

MARSHALL

Hey, you guys back already?

MARSHALL

How was...

(thinks, then remembers)

...the ballet?

ALICE

(theatrically)

It was the experience of a lifetime.

MARSHALL

How `bout a hug for the old man.

SHEPHERD

Mr. President... they're ready for

you in the conference room.

MARSHALL

Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me

all about it later, right?

ALICE

Sure.

ROSE

May I speak to you for a moment?

MARSHALL

Can't it wait?

ROSE

No, Mr. President.  It can't.

ROSE

Don't.  I know spin control when I

feel it.

MARSHALL

Rose, I don't have time for this.

ROSE

For godsakes, Jim, slow down and

stop acting like the little dutch

boy.  Not even you can plug all the

world's leaks.  Don't you think it's

a sign you're pushing too hard when

your daughter sees more of you on

MTV news than in person.

MARSHALL

She's a big girl.  She understands.

ROSE

How do you know she understands?

You haven't spent more than five

minutes with her, or me, in weeks.

MARSHALL

And when have I had five minutes?

When I wake up in the morning and

I'm already three hours behind

Schedule.  What do you want me to

do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off

because I'm a family man?

(BEAT)

I'm sorry. That wasn't fair.

ROSE

No. It wasn't.

MARSHALL

You know what?

ROSE

What?

MARSHALL

I miss you. And I miss her.

ROSE

But that's the point, Jim. We're

right here.

MARSHALL

I wish it were that easy...

MARSHALL

I'll make it up to you, I promise.

ROSE

I should trust that promise? Because

you know the voters are still waiting

for that middle class tax cut.

MARSHALL

This promise isn't subject to

Congressional approval.

ROSE

How did your speech go?

MARSHALL

Well, they aren't burning me in

effigy. That's always a good sign.

SHEPHERD (0.5.)

Mr. President.

MARSHALL

Look on the bright side, hon. Shep

here thinks I'll be a one termer.

ROSE

Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to

schedule your daughter in?

SHEPHERD

She is scheduled. Her school play's

Tuesday night.

MARSHALL

The First Lady was making a joke,

Shep. I'll make some time, Rose. I

promise.

(THICK ACCENT)

United States Air Force One, this is

tower. It's an honor to clear you

for immediate take-off on runway

three.

COL. AXELROD

Roger, Tower. And thank you for the

hospitality.

CNN REPORTER (T.V.)

In an unusually aggressive speech,

the President characterized the

Stravanavitch regime as thugs whose

brutality will no longer be tolerated.

Meanwhile, in Turkmenistan,

Stravanavitch's ouster has sent the

country into turmoil.  Tens of

thousands of refugees continue to

huddle in U.N. safe havens, as rival

Stravanavitch loyalists fight among

themselves for control. But at least

for the time being, the ethnic

cleansing has been stopped.

MAJOR CALDWELL

Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100

hours. What you see here is the

mobilization of two mechanized

brigades.

MARSHALL

They've gotta be joking.

DOHERTY

The Iraqi ambassador is claiming

it's just an exercise.

MARSHALL

An exercise in futility. Send the

Nimitz back in.

MAJOR CALDWELL

The northern border's gotten a bit

hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag

with our Tomcats and our boys are

just itching to engage.

MARSHALL

Tell our boys to cool their jets. I

don't need `em creating policy for

me.

GIBBS

Hey Walters, you and Johnson come

here a second. Reykjavik just sent

the advance team report.

BAZYLEV

UP! GET UP NOW!

BAZYLEV

Walk in front of us. Go! Go! Go!

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

SHOTS FIRED! SECURE BOY SCOUT!

into his lapel mike)

SHOTS FIRED! SHOTS FIRED!

GIBBS

Come on! Quickly.

GIBBS

The Secret Service believes in being

prepared for any eventuality.

SECRET SERVICE AGENT (V.0.)

We have a code red, I repeat, code

red. Shots fired onboard.

LT. CCL. INGRAHAMS

Warsaw tower this is Air Force One.

Declaring Emergency.

COL. AXELROD

Ranstein Air Base, this is Air Force

RAMSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLER

Fuck me. GO WAKE THE GENERAL. NOW!

RAMSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLER

Air Force One Heavy, acknowledged.

You are on our scope. Please state

fuel remaining and souls onboard.

COL. AXELROD (RADIO)

Sixty seven souls onboard, we're

okay with fuel. Request secure

military escort with emergency medical

standing by.

RAMSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLER

Air Force One Heavy, acknowledged.

We are scrambling our fighters.

RAMSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLLR

Call Berlin Tower. Not a plane lands

or takes off within two hundred miles!

Understood?

A.F. SPECIALIST #2

General Greely? No sir, Interrupt her. This is       this

MARSHALL

What's going on?

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

We're under attack.

MARSHALL

Where's my family?

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

We're handling it, sir.

MARSHALL

The launch codes! Who's protecting

the football?

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

Don't open the door!

ZEDECK

Down! Everybody down.

ZEDECK

STAY DOWN, PLACE YOUR HANDS BEHIND

YOUR HEAD AND YOU WILL NOT BE SHOT!

LT. COL. INGRAHAMS

Warsaw Tower has cleared local

airspace.

COL. AXELROD

Changing course heading to 276 point

five. Dropping to twenty thousand

feet.

COL. AXELROD

Ingrahams, make sure that door's

locked.

LT. COL. INGRAHAMS

Yes sir.

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

Get back! Get back!

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

We have Boy Scout, traveling forward.

VOICE (OVER MIKE)

Negative... negative... they're up

here too.

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

Roger. We're going to the chute.

MARSHALL

ROSE! ALICE!

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

Come on, sir.

MARSHALL (O.S.)

Alice!

ALICE

Daddy...

SERGE

Down! Everyone down!

COT. CARLTON (RADIO)

Air Force One, this is Squadron

Commander Canton. You are now under

escort. All airspace has been cleared.

COL. AXELROD

This is Air Force One Heavy. I'm

coming in full throttle. ETA to

Ranstein eight minutes. We've got a

war here, sir.

COT. AXELROD (V.0.)

Roger that.

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

Get in!

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

Get in, sir.

MARSHALL

What about my family?

SECRET SERVICE AGENT #

I have a family, too, sir. Now get

in the fucking pod.

SECRET SERVICE AGENT #

Mr. President... MR. PRESIDENT! You

have to do this! The pod, on three.

Ready?

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

One.

MARSHALL

But...

SECRET SERVICE AGENT

(cutting him off)

Two... THREE. GO!

COT. AXELROD

(into mike)

Ramstein/Air Force One: Emergency

pod has been deployed. I repeat,

emergency pod has been deployed.

RANSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLER

This is Ramstein. Acknowledged. We

are picking up the homing beacon and

deploying search and rescue.

COT. AXELROD

Copy Ramstein. We are dropping to

five thousand feet, beginning final

approach.

ALICE (O.S.)

Daddy? Dad?

NEVSKY

Your father has left you behind.

ROSE

NO!

ZEDECK

Open! Now!

COT. AXELROD

Ramatein, we are fifteen miles away

on final approach. I'm coming in

fast and will need every inch of

runway.

COT. AXELROD

Let's get this crate on the ground.

COL. AXELROD

Almost there.

BAZYLEV

Keep moving!

GIBBS

Throttle up. Throttle up!

RAMSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLER

Aw Fuck. We're losing it!

A C-141 STARLIFTER

in his path. A monstrous plane, every

bit as big as Air Force One. Gibbs

eases back on the wheel and the 747

sluggishly responds, its nose creeping

upward.

GIBBS

Come on.

GIBBS

Okay, 30,000 feet. Give me my heading.

ZEDECK

Bearing 110 point eight two.

GIBBS

Call me if something changes.

ZEDECK

That's it?

GIBBS

To fly a 747 you need to know three

things. How to take of f, how to

land, and how to engage the autopilot.

KORSHUNOV

The rest of the secret service?

GIBBS

Dead.

KORSHUNOV

How many others killed?

GIBBS

Nine.

KORSHUNOV

Any of us?

GIBBS

No damages.

ROSE

Where's my daughter?

GIBBS

She's alive, ma'am, for the time

being.

ROSE

And my husband?

GIBBS

The secret service did their job,

ma'am. The President is safely off

the plane.

(to Korshunov)

But that still leaves us plenty to

bargain with.

ROSE

Mr. Gibbs. You, of all people...

GIBBS

Follow me, ma'am.

V.P. CHANDLER

We should have the President secure

within minutes. Do we know who these

terrorists are or where they're going?

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

General Greely says it looks like

the Middle East.

V.P. CHANDLER

Does your office have anything to

add, Mr. Dean?

DEAN

The garners believe that, given the

scenario, there's an 86% chance that

V.P. CHANDLER

If we're dealing with an airborne

hostage situation what's our

procedure?

LEE

Our only policy assumes the plane is

on the ground. Our hands are

completely tied while they're in the

air.

V.P. CHANDLER

Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action

until we confirm that the president

is off the plane... Lee, go huddle

with the D.O.D. I want an options

paper on this in 20 minutes.

LEE

Twenty minutes?

V.P. CHANDLER

You heard me.

(points to an aide)

You. Congress and cabinet heads.

AIR FORCE COLONEL

Madame Vice-President?

V.P. CHANDLER

Yes?

AIR FORCE COLONEL

National Command Authority. All

previous launch codes have been

cancelled. You're carrying the ball

now.

V.P. CHANDLER

Thank you, Colonel. Have a seat.

FIGHTER PILOT #1

No sir. I just wish...

COL. CARLTON

Roger. We all wish... Now shut the

fuck up and escort.

NEVSKY

Every weapon and every person is

accounted for.

KORSHUNOV

Fear will keep you alive. Any one

who is not afraid is bound to do

something foolish, and bound to die.

ROSE

What do you want with us?

KORSHUNOV

Cooperation. If you try to escape,

you will be met with automatic gunfire

and a barricade of your comrade's

bodies will prevent you from exiting.

Good day.

DOHERTY

This can't be happening. You just

don't pull this shit with the United

States. You just don't.

MAJOR CALDWELL

Keep your heads.

SHEPHERD

Mrs. Marshall, are you okay?

ROSE

We're alive.

SHEPHERD

That's all that matters. Thank god

the President got of f the plane.

ROSE

Yes... thank God.

(to caldwell)

You there... Caidwell, right? What's

on your mind?  caldwell takes a beat,

then crosses to Rose and Shepherd.

MAJOR CALDWELL

(hushed)

I don't want to get anybody here

excited, but if we can get out of

this room, I can get us to safety.

SHEPHERD

We're thirty five thousand feet up.

MAJOR CALDWELL

Yes, sir, that's a problem, but if

we can somehow get to a lower

altitude, the rear loading ramp on

the baggage deck is equipped with

parachutes in case of an engine

failure. Now we can either wait for

a political resolution, or try to

resolve this thing ourselves.

DOHERTY

You're goddamn right we can resolve

this ourselves. We'll negotiate.

SHEPHERD

You know the President's policy.

DOHERTY

The President isn't here.

ROSE

Right now we are an enormous liability

to the United States. We can't just

sit and do nothing.

VIAD

Standing guard, facing the opposite

direction.

KORSHUNOV

Proceed.

KORSHUNOV (SPEAKER)

...the Chief of Staff, the First

Lady, and the First Daughter.  Our

demands are simple. Arrange the

release of Ivan Stravanvitch.  Once

our leader is returned to Turkuenistan

soil, Air Force One and it's occupants

will be allowed safe passage to

Switzerland. You have one hour before

we start killing hostages.

V.P. CHANDLER

Find that voice for me, I want to

know who we're dealing with. And get

President Petrov on the phone.

GENERAL GREELY

Madame Vice-President, we just got

word from Ramstein... The nod was

UntiL Chandler stands.

V.P. CHANDLER

Empty?

GENERAL GREELY

The President... he must still be

onboard.

V.P. CHANDLER

Play back that call.

TECHNICAL OFFICER

Yes, sir.

KORSHUNOV (V.0. TAPE)

The plane is under our command, and

those we did not kill we hold as

hostages, including the Chief of

Staff, the First Lady, and the First

Daughter.

V.P. CHANDLER

but not the President. Not the

President.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

He's dead then. They must have killed

him.

DEAN

We don't know that.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

Holding the president hostage is not

something that slips your mind when

you're making demands.

V.P. CHANDLER

And if he's dead? Do you really think

they'd risk telling us?

DEAN

There is a possibility we're

overlooking.

DEAN

When I ran Specops in `Nam, I ordered

the destruction of a V.C.  munitions

dump. During insertion, the plane

was shot down and the entire team

was killed, or so we thought. Two

days later the dump

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

Walter, if you have a point, make

it.

DEAN

That kid's name was Jim Marshall.

V.P. CHANDLER

So what are you saying?

DEAN

Maybe he's alive on that plane and

those bastards don't even know it.

V.P. CHANDLER

Mr. Dean, may I remind you that the

President is not 19 anymore.

MARSHALL

Goddamnit.

MAJOR CALDWELL

This is a dead end.

VLAD

Get on the floor, now!

VIAD

(wonderment)

The President.

MARSHALL

That's right, asshole.

MARSHALL

I don't think so.

MARSHALL

Clear.

NEVSKY

Viad?

NEVSKY (O.S.)

Vlad? Vlad?

MARSHALL

Where are th*y? fly tamily, the

crew.... where are they?

MARSHALL

o'11 unlocli the door for me or I'll

kill you.

NEVSKY

KORSKUNOV!

SHIT1

INT. CORRIDOR.

KORSHUNOV

Go after him.

SERGE

I know you're in there. Come on out.

(a few beats)

Okay. Have it your way.

KORSHUNOV (O.S.)

(calling down)

Serge?

MARSHALL

The NRA'll love this.

PETROV

I understand your dilemma, Vice

President Chandler. But unless you

can confirm that your President is

indeed a hostage, I cannot release

Stravanavitch. If Marshall is dead,

no good will come of meeting this

demand. We both know he would agree.

PETROV

*.. is not a First Lady if her

husband's been killed. Then she's a

civilian. And I can't release him

for a civilian. Do you see my point?

LEE

Madame Vice president. We have an

options paper.  chandler takes the

options paper, waves off Lee, and

reads it as she talks.

V.P. CHANDLER

Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.

PETROV (V.0.)

But I will deploy forces to a staging

area near the Turkmenistan border.

When you have more information, we

can decide how to proceed.

V.P. CHANDLER

By then I'll be President.

V.P. CHANDLER

(of f options paper)

I don't like any of these. from, did

you brief General Northwood?

V.P. CHANDLER

Can we do that?

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

We've got four hours before they

make it into Turkienistan airspace.

V.P. CHANDLER

But they start executing hostages in

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll

sacrifice pawns before kings. It may

take them some time to kill their

way up to senior staff.

V.P. CHANDLER

Okay. Also, I want you to put our

bases in Turkey on alert, and have

the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory

air strike.

V.P. CHANDLER

I've not discounted your theory Hr.

DEAN

No... I got the new numbers from our

gamers. They believe that there's

only an eight percent chance that

the President is still alive.

V.P. CHANDLER

Eight percent is better than zero.

GENERAL GREELY

That's trouble.

V.P. CHANDLER

Would someone get the Press Secretary!

AIDE

He's been holding on line four.

KORSHUNOV

Who did this?

GIBBS

We checked the manifest. Everyone

was accounted for.

KORSHUNOV

A secret service agent. It must be.

KORSHUNOV

The conference room is no longer

secure. We'll take the First Lady

and the girl up top where we can

keep a closer eye on them.

MAJOR CAL DWELL

We're not getting out that way.

KORSHUNOV

Admirable, but you're wasting your

time.

(beat)

Mrs. Marshall, would you and your

daughter please come here.

KORSHUNOV

Now, or he dies, please.

ROSE

Come on, Alice.

ALICE

I'm scared.

DOHERTY

You've got the better part of the

White House locked in this room, you

know. If you want to negotiate, we're

the ones to do it with.

KORSHUNOV

Mrs. Marshall. Alice. If you please.

ROSE

It's okay. Do what you're told. It's

okay. We'll be okay.

MARSHALL

Goddamnit.

VOICE (O.S. PHONE)

Information. How can I assist you?

MARSHALL

Washington D.C.?

VOICE

Yes, sir. Can I help you?

MARSHALL

Yes, the number for the White House.

ALICE

I don't drink coffee.

KORSHUNOV

You must be tired. It'll wake you

up.

ALICE

No, thank you. The gunfire did that.

ROSE

Leave my daughter alone.

KORSHUNOV

Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?

(beat, he chuckles)

But I admire your courage. Your

husband, on the other hand...

ROSE

What do you know of my husband?

KORSHUNOV

I know he left you behind.

ROSE

My husband is a very courageous man.

KORSHUNOV

Your husband is a coward. He sends

soldiers half-way around the world

to steal a man from his home in the

middle of the night.

ALICE

You're one of Stravanavitch's men.

KORSHUNOV

So, you study world events, little

one. That's good for a girl your

age.

ALICE

Yeah, I study world events. Five

thousand Turkienistan Muslims were

slaughtered in Stravanvitch's

cleansings... along with 15 American

school kids. You know hQw I studied

that. I went to their funerals with

my dad. I met their parents.

KORSHUNOV

Smart for your age, eh? Top of your

class? Tell me, do you know what the

word "propaganda" means?

ALICE

Yeah. Do you know what the word

"asshole" means.

ROSE

Alice!

KORSHUNOV

Yes, I have heard that word.

KORSHUNOV

Yes, I am an asshole.

KORSHUNOV

Your father is a reasonable man.

SWITCHBOARD

White House switchboard. How may I

direct your call.

MARSHALL

(hushed urgency)

Okay listen, listen carefully. This

is an emergency call from Air Force

One. Who's there? Is the Vice-

President there?

SWITCHBOARD

who can I say is calling?

MARSHALL (0.S. PHONE)

This is the President.

SWITCHBOARD

Yeah, right.

MARSHALL

Don't cut me off. This is an

emergency.

SWITCHBOARD

Sir, the President does not call

this particular number. So whoever

you are get a life, before I have

this call traced.

MARSHALL

You don't understand. This is an

emergency. Let me talk to anyone.

SWITCHBOARD

Okay... if you're the President,

when's your wife's birthday?

MARSHALL

Look lady, I don't have time for

games. Just put the....

SWITCHBOARD

Thank you for calling the white

House...

MARSHALL

No. no. no. Wait. Wait.

MARSHALL

I should know this.

MARSHALL (V.0.)

It's June.

SWITCHBOARD

Sir? Are you there? Sir? Sir?

BAZ YLEV

Hands away from your weapon.

BAZYLEV

Come now. You don't want to die.

BAZYLEV

On your knees...

PHONE (O.S.)

Hello. Is anyone there?

BAZYUV

What's that in your shirt? Open it.

BAZYLEV

Take it off. Now.

V.P. CHANDLER

My intention is not to escalate the

situation, but it's a contigency

that must be considered. Hang on...

(to Aide)

What?

AIDE

The switchboard says that someone

called in claiming to be the

President, then she heard gunfire.

DEAN

Could be some crank watching CNN.

AIDE

No sir. Trace confirms the call is

Coming from a White House staff

cellular account.

V.P. CHANDLER

Put it through down here.

(into phone)

Hang on, Toni.

V.P. CHANDLER

What's going on in the background?

DEAN

Max, get me Willis.

WILLIS

Tracking... Intercepting call... Got

it. Ten seconds, Mr. Dean.

BAZYLEV (V.0.)

Hands... hands behind your head, Mr.

V.P. CHANDLER

It's him. He is alive.

BAZYLEV

I'm going to take your weapon now,

and then I'm going to take you

Upstairs to join the others.

DEAN

Christ, they have him.

BAZYLEV

And if you make any sudden moves, I

will not hesitate to shoot.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

Maybe they don't have him yet.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

And maybe we aren't so helpless.

GENERAL NORTPNOOD

General Greely, Air Force One has

automatic countermeasures, right?

GENERAL GREELY

Everything we own is in that plane.

GENERAL NORTINOOD

So a single missile launched from a

distance should be a mere distraction.

GENERAL GREELY

Theoretically.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

(into phone)

Ramutein Tower Control, please.

GENERAL GREELY

(getting it)

But the effect could be jarring.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

Exactly. Ramstein? General

Northwood... Patch me through to

your fighters. Madame Vice

President... with your permission?

V.P. CHANDLER

Do it.

BAZ YLEV

So you're the President. Somehow, I

thought you'd be smaller.

BAZYLEV

Not so powerful now, eh? No aides to

advise you, no secret service to

protect you, no armies to command.

BAZYLEV

You'll suffer for what you've done.

MARSHALL

*                    So will you.

BAZYLEV

Up. Get up now!

BAZYLEV

You will walk ahead... slowly. Do

you understand?

(no response)

Do you understand!

MARSHALL

Do you know what's going to happen

to you because of this? Do you know

what the world will do?

BAZYLEV

Nothing. The world will do nothing.

COL. CARLTON (V.0.)

You want me to what?

GENERAL NORTPNOOD (V.0.)

You heard the order. And do not, I

repeat, do not take your best shot.

COL. CARLTON

Roger, sir. Okay boys, clear the

deck. I have been ordered to engage

Air Force One.

COL. CARLTON

Assuming attack posture. Targeting

computer is on.

COL. CARLTON

Target is acquired. I have good tone

CLOSE ON: The flight stick. Carlton's

finger over the firing button. He

hesitates.

COL. CARLTON

They're gonna court martial me for

this.

ZEDECK

What is this?

ZEDECK

Gibbs! Gibbs! Get in here.

BAZYLEV

Don't move!

GIBBS

What the hell's going on?

ZEDECK

The Americans fired at us.

GIBBS

Why would they fire on us?

"Missile Closing:

ZEDECK

Do something.

GIBBS

I'm not a combat pilot.

ZEDECK

Shit!

"Missile Neutralized"

GIBBS

We're okay.

KORSHUNOV

Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.

GIBBS

why did they do that?

KORSHUNOV

Psychology. They're trying to unnerve

us.

GIBBS

Well it worked.

KORSHUNOV

Relax, my friend. Apparently they

cannot harm us. Even if they wanted

to.  rNT. FRONT GALLEY.

BAZYLEV

(disgust)

The leader of the free world.

ALICE

Mom?

ROSE

Yes dear?

ALICE

I'm sorry I was so mean to you

earlier.

ROSE

I know, sweetie. I know.

(beat)

You're being very brave.

SERGE

(to Zedeck)

He's not up here. I'm going down

below.

MARSHALL

Did they say anything about my family?

V.P. CHANDLER

They're still alive, but the loyalists

plan to start killing hostages in

forty minutes.

MARSHALL

Then tell me there's a rescue

operation underway.

V.P. CHANDLER

and if that means negotiating...

MARSHALL

You know my policy. We don't negotiate

with terrorists. If we start now,

all of America becomes a target.

V.P. CHANDLER

But this is different, sir. You're

the President.

V.P. CHANDLER

Please, Mr. President. You're going

to get yourself killed. Is that your

solution?

MARSHALL

Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get

tens of thousands killed. I can't

live with that.

(somewhat resigned)

I'm not royalty. I'm an elected

official and the integrity of the

office of the President is infinitely

more important than the man who holds

that office.

(beat)

We don't negotitate. Not as long as

I'm President. Is that understood?

MARSHALL

flow, is there a rescue operation

under way or not?

LEE

He's not on a secure line.

DEAN

I'm here, Mr. President.

MARSHALL

Where's the cavalry?

DEAN

We can't do anything until that plane

lands. And when it does land, sir,

it's going to be in hostile *

territory. To be perfectly honest,

we don't know what the hell to do.

MARSHALL

I'll see what I can do.

SERGE

Bazylev is dead.

SERGE

Trapped On the baggage deck. Let me

go finish him.

KORSHUNOV

No. He has the advantage down there.

SERGE

You. Come with me.

MARSHALL

What the hell...

MARSHALL

(murmuring)

Out of fuel.

MARSHALL

Come on, where are you...

KORSHUNOV

Ms. Mitchell. Hello again.

ROSE

Maria.

KORSHUNOV

*                     Please tell me

your name.

MITCHELL

(frightened)

Maria... Maria Mitchell.

KORSHUNOV

And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.

MITCHELL (V.0.)

I'm responsible for Press Relations

for the Flight Office.

KORSHUNOV (V.0.)

How are your fellow hostages feeling,

Ms. Mitchell?

MITCHELL

Scared. We're scared.

KORSHUNOV

And why are you scared?

MITCHEL*L

Because... because I don't want to

die.

KORSHUNOV

And what am I doing at this very

moment.

MITCHELL

You're pointing a gun at me.

KORSHUNOV

Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.

KORSHUNOV

Now, to the secret service agent in

the baggage deck. I'm giving you ten

seconds to surrender, or this women

will die.

Aw, Jesus.

KORSFL3NOV (V.0.)

I'll give you a few minutes to think

about that one and then we'll try

again. Perhaps soon I will choose

somebody important.

MARSHALL

(to himself)

She was important.

ROSE

Do you have to be so brutal?

KORSHUNOV

Yes

ROSE

Why? Do you enjoy it?

KORSHUNOV

I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do

what is necessary.

ROSE

How can you? I mean they're people.

KORSHUNOV

But they are not ny people. You look

at me as if I am a monster, but answer

me this -- when your planes bombed

the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry

for those dark skinned men whose

names you do not know and who's faces

You will never see? Did You cry for

their wives and children. They were

people too, yes... but they were not

your people.

ROSE

That was war.

KORSHUNOV

So is this.

(beat)

Come now, you're upsetting the little

one.

ALICE

The woman you shot. She was my friend.

KORSHUNOV

That's the way of the world, little

one. Didn't they teach you that in

school?

VOICE

(through static)

Chief Mechanic, 87th Air. How can I

help you?

MARSHALL

You can talk me through an emergency

fuel dump.

MAJOR CALDWELL

Led off to slaughter one at a time.

SHEPHERD

They can shoot enough of us.

MAJOR CALDWELL

If we don't act, they'll kill US all

eventually Who's with me?

CHIEF MECHANIC

Do you see the maintenance panel?

MARSHALL

Got it.

CHIEF MECHANIC

Pop it open. There should be a red

switch, toggle it up.

MARSHALL

Okay, it's on. We've got some

indicator lights here.

CHIEF MECHANIC

Okay, you're aerated. To dump the

fuel you have to close the circuit

for the pump. There's no switch in

Avionics so you'll have to cross the

wires. There should be five wires,

just to your left. Do you see them?

MARSHALL

Got `en.

CHIEF MECHANIC

Okay, hang on. Let me double check

MARSHALL

I'll wait.

CHIEF MECHANIC

First... cut... green wire.

MARSHALL

It's cut.

CHIEF MECHANIC

cross it...  The static overwhelms

the voice, then cuts out.

MARSHALR'

Hello? Hello? Goddamnit.

MARSHALL

An emergency landing in friendly

territory... there's your goddamn

miracle.

GIBBS

Goddamnit it. We're losing fuel.

KORSHUNOV

How?

GIBBS

Avionics compartment! It's the only

place. You better get Zedeck down

there fast Unless, of course, you'd

rather be a martyr than a savior.

KORSHUNOV

(to Zedeck)

Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.

ZEDECK

He's down here. I can feel it.

SERGE

Shut up and do your job.

ZEDECK (O.S.)

The valve is shut. This guy sure

knew what he was doing.

ZEDECK

You see him?

SERGE

Erring on the side of caution.

ZEDECK

I'm going to deactivate the by-pass

pump. It'll take a minute.

GIBBS

We've stopped dumping... but we've

only got about twenty minutes of

fuel left.

KORSHUNOV

We're not going to make it.

GIBBS

Not even close. Hell, we can't even

make Syria or Iraq.

KORSHUNOV

Where are we now?

GIBBS

Over the Black Sea. I can probably

get us to Turkey or Georgia.

KORSHUNOV

No! If we land this plane anywhere

else, we will end up another Entebe.

(beat)

The Americans built a super plane

that flies through mushroom cloud,

evades missiles and...

(holding up Maria

Mitchell's press kit)

refuels in mid-air. Call the White

House.

AIDE

It's him again.

KORSHUNOV

Gentlemen, forgive me for diverting

you from your little wargames, but

I've just added another demand to my

very short list. I assure you it's

quite reasonable.

KORSHUNOV (V.0. PHONE)

We need fuel, gentlemen. And we need

it right now.

LEE

Finally, we can bargain.

V.P. CHANDLER

I'm sure we can strike some sort of

arrangement. Land the plane and we'll

trade you hostages for fuel.

KORSHUNOV

No. The plane lands when I say, or

it will crash. The hostages are

released when I say, or they will

die.

KORSHUNOV

Tell me what I want to hear or I

will execute a member of the senior

staff, and will continue killing one

hostage every minute until we crash

or until a refueling plane arrives.

KORSHUNOV

Shall I begin by executing the

President's daughter? She's right

here.

ROSE

No.

KORSHUNOV

Say something dear.

ALICE

Fuck off, you stupid asshole.

KORSHUNOV

It would be a pity to squander such

a strong personality.

KORSHUNOV

Well? What do you say?

KORSHUNOV

We trained for months. Everything

should've gone like clockwork.

ZEDECK

We have the hostages, we're getting

more fuel.

KORSHUNOV

He's already killed three of us, and

we haven't even seen him. He's also

shown that he can hurt us. I need to

think.

(looks at Serge)

What the hell are you doing up here?

MARSHALL

Don't make the same mistake your

friend did earlier... Show me your

hands.

MARSHALL

Open the door.

MARSHALL

It's me goddamnit. Let me go.

SHEPHERD

Mr. President, how the hell did you

get on board?

MARSHALL

I never left. Where's my wife and

daughter?

MAJOR CALDWELL

They took `em out. They're probably

on the upper deck.

SHEPHERD

Mr. President, Major Caldwell here

has a plan to get these hostages of

f the plane.

MARSHALL

I dumped most of the fuel. They'll

land soon and Delta will take its

shot.

SERGE

A refueling plane is already on it's

way so we won't be landing until we

reach Turkmenistan. Your best course

of action is to release me. I will

be merciful.

MARSHALL

Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few

miles away. How do you propose getting

us from here to there?

MAJOR CALDWELL

Gravity.

DEAN

Of the three dozen airports in

Turkmenistan, only five have

sufficient runways for a 747. Of

those five, only these three have

shown any activity.

GENERAL NORTPNOOD

But this one here, see this. It's a

satellite dish and it wasn't there

two weeks ago. Basic communications

uplink, which suggests extensive

communicatins ability. I'd say this

was the one.

V.P. CHANDLER

Are you confident you can take the

facility?

GENERAL NORTIWOOD

It's night there for a few more hours.

That's a real plus. But I won't lie.

As far as special ops go, this one's

a bear, but I think we squeeze it

out.

V.P. CHANDLER

Let's get it going.

AIDE

The Press Secretary's about to go

on.

MAJOR CALDWELL

If we can get to a lower altitude,

we can use parachutes, but at this

altitude, we'll pass out from Oxygen

deprivation.

MARSHALL

We've already played our cards, Major.

There's no turning back.

MAJOR CALDWELL

We can't jump from here or at this

speed. But if we could get a message

out - tell the refueling plane...

MARSHALL

They've cut communication, and I

spent a good bit of time looking for

alternatives. My only solution ran

out of batteries.

SECRETARY

The fax machines.

MARSHALL

Excuse me?

SECRETARY

The fax machines.

MARSHALL

(dismissive)

No good. I said they disabled the

communications system.

SECRETARY

No. I thought about this, Mr.

MARSHALL

(to Caldwell)

Get `em ready.

(to secretary)

You... come with me.

MAJOR CALDWELL

Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two

hundred knots... otherwise it's

suicide.

MARSHALL

Got it.

PRESS SECRETARY

Please. Quiet please... First let

me... Please... I have a prepared

statement... The White House confirms

that the President's aircraft, Air

Force One, has been hijacked and is

currently controlled by foreign

nationals.

REPORTERS

Is the President onboard?/ What about

the First Family?/ What are their

demands?

PRESS SECRETARY

Please... please... For security

reasons I can not comment on any

specifics except to say that the

Vice-President is doing everything

within her power to resolve the

situation.

PULL BACK

We're in the...

KORSHUNOV

And you are almost out of time.

SECRETARY

Here sir.

SECRETARY

Where are we sending it?

MARSHALL

White House Situation room.

MARSHALL

Someone should give you a raise.

SECRETARY

Actually, sir, you could be that

someone.

MARSHALL

It's yours.

ZEDECK

Still no movement on Stravanavitch.

ROSE

Nor will there be. My husband does

not negotiate with terrorists.

KORSHUNOV

You will be the first to pay for

that mistake.

MAJOR CALDWELL

These chutes are designed for a safe

slow descent. They'll deploy off the

line automatically as you step from

the plane.

(turns to another

group, mostly younger

men)

You guys'll have to pull your own

rip cords. Wait until you're clear

from the plane, but not any longer.

(he checks packs and

straps)

Once I check you, go stand behind

the yellow line. You're good. You're

good. You're good.

MAJOR CALDWELL

Mr. president?  pwtsHALL The fax

went through. We can only wait.

MAJOR CAWWELL

Your chute.

MARSHALL

I'll not going without my family.

MAJOR CALDWELL

Yes, sir.

MAJOR CALDWELL

Sir, we stay with the President.

MARSHALL

That isn't necessary.

take a moment.

MARSHALL

Hey, by the way... who won the Duke

game?

AIDE

Find out for yourself, sir. I'll

have it waiting at the White House.

MAJOR CALDWELL

Here we go.

KORSHUNOV

What's that?

COL. CARLTON

Here they come.

COL. CMLTON (V.0.)

We got... okay... so far ten chutes

deploying of f the line. Dropping

signal flares for search and rescue.

GIBBS

She's bucking. I can't hold her!

KC-135 PILOT

LOOK OUT!

GIBBS

Holy Shiti Gibbs pushes the stick

down and Air Force One begins to

dive to safety.

COL. CARLTON

Everybody break. Now! Now! Now!

ZEDECK

Don't move.

MAJOR CALDWELL

Let me save him.

ZEDECK

That man, he is the president, no?

SHEPHERD

Yes. Yes he is.

KORSHUNOV

Fuel?

GIBBS

More than enough to get us home.

V.P. CHANDLER

They still have the President, it's

past their deadline and they haven't

called. What do you think it means?

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

Like any good poker player, they're

checking over their hand seeing which

cards to play and which to discard.

ALICE

(to Korshunov)

He didn't leave us.

KORSHUNOV

You are a resilient man, Mr.

KORSHUNQV

You must forgive the tape, but we

were starting to feel outnumbered...

MARSHALL

Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do

this?

GIBBS

Yes, Mr. President.

MARSHALL

Why?

GIBBS

Because it is my duty.

MARSHALL

You're duty to what? The country you

served doesn't exist anymore.

GIBBS

My loyalty was never to my country.

KORSHUNOV

You don't think the leaders of the

KGB would allow peristroika to ruin

years of infiltration? No, when the

Soviet Union collapsed, we took our

sleepers with us.

KORSHUNOV

Now since we've had very little luck

getting Washington or Moscow to

cooperate, I wondered if you would

be so kind.

MARSHALL

Over my dead body.

KORSHUNOV

No. But since I only have a few of

your staff left to kill, perhaps I

will start with your family instead...

Gibbs.

KORSHUNOV

The world is such a dangerous place

and we can't always protect our

children.

ROSE

Please. You can kill me but leave my

daughter alone.

MARSHALL

She isn't a part of this. This is

between you and me.

KORSHUNOV

Call up Petrov and order

Stravanavitch' S release.

MARSHALL

This administration does not negotiate

with terrorists.

KORSHUNOV

Pity. Mr. Gibbs.

KORSHUNOV

Perhaps a President does not

negotiate, but does a father?

(beat)

An interesting choice. Your daughter

versus your world vision. The implicit

trust of a family against your oath

of office.

ALICE

Daddy...

MARSHALL

Alice... I...

KORSHUNOV

And once the trigger is pulled, she

is gone forever. Then, I wonder, how

do you live, knowing you could've

saved her?

KORSHUNOV

And could you ever forget the look

on her face as she ceases to exist...

Late at night, when you think about

her, will Stravanavitch really matter

anymore?

ALICE

Daddy. Daddy, please...

ROSE

Jim... for godsake!

KORSHUNOV

Look inside your heart. No one will

think you weak. Five...

KORSHUNOV

KORSHUNOV

MARSHALL

NO!

MARSHALL

Stop.

KORSHUNOV

You'll do it?

MARSHALL

Yes, I'll do it.

(broken)

Just leave my family alone.

KORSHUNOV

Good. Good.

KORSHUNOV

Bring him the phone...

MARSHALL

Someday, you'll regret my nature.

KORSHUNOV

You don't like seeing people get

hurt. Now in morality, that is a

virtue. In politics, however, that

is weakness.

(beat)

You were a hostage to everyone else

*                    long before you

were a hostage to

AIDE

Sir, the President of the United

States wishes to speak with you.

PETROV

Mr. President.

GUARD

Stravanavitch.

ROSE

Can my husband sit next to me?

ROSE

I don't know why you stayed.

MARSHALL

Please... don't start with me.

ROSE

There's something I need to tell

you... and God knows if I'll ever

get another chance.

ROSE

No matter what happens, you have

been and always will be my hero.

MARSHALL

And you have always been my guardian

angel.

ROSE

I will never regret my life with

you.

SERGE

It's confirmed. Stravanavitch is on

his way out. Our men are waiting

outside.

ROSE

You got what you wanted. You going

to release us now?

KORSHUNOV

You're very valuable. And our nation

needs so many things.

MARSHALL

Could I... Could I have some water?

KORSHUNOV

The taste of defeat is bitter, no?

MARSHALL

One thing I've learned as

KORSHUNOV

e                    Very poetic.

MARSHALL

And there's one thing I've learned

from being a sports fan.

KORSHUNOV

And that is?

MARSHALL

It ain't over, til it's over.

MAJOR CALDWELL

Mr. President.

KORSHUNOV

Don't be hasty.

KORSHUNOV

You love your daughter, Mr.

MARSHALL

Shepherd.

SHEPHERD

Sir...

MARSHALL

Call Petrov...

(to Rose)

I'll be back.

ROSE

Both of you.

PETROV

Petrov.

GUARD

Halt! Halt!

PETROV

What is it?

AIDE

It's about Stravanvaitch.

PETROV

What about him?

AIDE

He's dead, sir. Shot while trying to

escape.

PETROV

So be it. The world will sleep easier.

COL. CARLTON

They've changed their bearing.

(into headset)

Air Force One. Air Force One.

FIGHTER PILOT #1

Sir, this new bearing. We're headed

for Iraq, sir.

ROSE

Easy, Major. Easy.

MAJOR CALDWELL

The President?

ROSE

You saved his life.

MARSHALL

It's over, Korshunov. You won. Now

let her go.

MARSHALL (O.S.)

There's nowhere to go.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

They aren't answering their hails.

DEAN

This doesn't make sense.

V.P. CHANDLER

How close are they?

LEE

The Iraqi Ambassador won't take our

calls. We're trying to get through

to their Central Command.

DEAN

To tell them what? The great infidel

himself is flying overhead, Go get

him? This is a man they burn in effigy

daily.

V.P. CHANDLER

If challenged, our fighters are to

state that they are on a rescue

mission.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're

already in on this or they'll think

we're spying.

V.P. CHANDLER

If fired upon, tell our fighters

that they are ordered to engage.

ALICE

Dad, look out.

MARSHALL

How you doing, sweetie?

ALICE

Been better, Dad... You?

COL. CARLTON

Air Force one... please respond. Air

Force One, you are entering hostile

air space. Air Force one...

FIGHTER PILOT #1

Halo one, acknowledged.

FIGHTER PILOT #2

Halo two, acknowledged.

KORSHUNOV

Stay where you are.

KORSHUNOV

There goes your ride.

MARSHALL

Let my daughter go or I'll take you

out!

KORSHUNOV

If you put down the gun, I promise

not to drop her on the way down.

MARSHALL

Let her go now! Or I will kill you.

KORSHUNOV

No you won't. You'll compromise...

like always.

MARSHALL

Hold on, Alice.

ALICE

NO!

ALICE

Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...

MARSHALL

It's okay, honey. I got you. I got

you. You're okay.

MARSHALL

Gone. They're all gone.

IRAQI SOLDIER

The Americans say they are escorting

a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm

they are surrounding a 747.

CERALLOS

Did we warn them off?

IRAQI SOLDIER

Yes. They refused to alter course

and the 747 would not answer our

hails.

CERALLOS

It's some kind of trick... a

preliminary airstrike in response to

our troop movement.

IRAQI SOLDIER

They are in our airspace. We would

be within our rights.

CERALLOS

The world would not look on us kindly

if we shot down a civilian airliner.

IRAQI SOLDIER

The pilot says it is does not have

the markings of a commercial jet.

CERALLOS

Warn then again. If they don't

respond... shoot them down. We will

not be intimidated.

MARSHALL

What is that sound?

MARSHALL

My god. I think that was a MiG.

SHEPHERD

A MiG? Where the hell are we?

MARSHALL

They're flying a protection formation.

(beat)

Call D.C. Find out what's going on.

MIS PILOT (V.0.)

This is your last warning. You are

violating our airspace. Leave

immediately.

COL. CARLTON

I said back off and hold your fire.

COL. CARLTON

Halo Team, this is group leader.

COL. CARLTON

This is the real thing boys. Let's

fly and fry.

AIDE

It's the Chief of Staff calling...

from Air Force One. They've retaken

control of the aircraft.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

Then tell him to get the fuck out of

Iraq.

SHEPHERD

Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.

MARSHALL

Iraq? Shep, you're fired.

MARSHALL

Shit.

SHEPHERD

How long's it been since you flew,

sir?

MARSHALL

Twenty-five years.

MIG PILOT

(arabic/subtitle)

I have radar lock on the 747.

"Dis-Engaging Auto-pilot"

MIG PILOT

It's evading. Can I take the shot?

MIG LEADER (V.0.)

Take the shot.

ROSE

What are you doing?

MARSHALL

Flying the plane.

ROSE

You haven't even driven a car since

you took office.

MARSHALL

I'm sure it's like riding a bicycle...

downhill with no brakes and somebody

shooting at you.

COL. CARLTON

We got two on the loose. Someone get

on them.

FIGHTER PILOT #2

Halo Two... I can't get there in

time.

COL. CARLTON

Bullshit. Do it.

MARSHALL

We got two coming at us!

"Heat Seekers"

"Launching Flares"

MARSHALL

U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.

COL. CARLTON

Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the

party.

MARSILALL

Can you... can you drop in front of

me? I'll follow you out.

COL. CARLTON

Hang tough, I'm on my way.

FIGHTER PILOT 11

I'm tight on one, the other's loose.

MARSHALL

We're hit. We've got an engine on

fire.

COT. CAALTON (V.0.)

Shut it down. Shut it down.

MARSHALL

This is President Marshall. I know

you guys are busy, but we need some

help here.

COL. CARLTON

Mr. President, it's an honor. Now

with your permission can we lead you

the fuck out of here.

MARSHALL

You read my mind.

COL. CARLTON

Put your pilot on.

MARSHALL

He's busy being dead.

COL. CARLTON

Who's flying the fucking plane?

MARSHALL

I'm doing what I can.

COL. CAELTON

Can you, can you change your heading

to Zero Four One point six?

MARSHALL

Negative. We've lost navagition. I

don't know where that is.

COL. CARLTON

Oh shit. Hang on. Somebody help me

out. I got one up my ass.

COL. CARLTON

Two and three are heading toward the

Boeing.

COL. CARLTON

Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to

the right. Got it?

MARSHALL

Got it.

COL. CARLTON

Stay cool.

MARSHALL

How we doing, Colonel?

COL. CARLTON

We still got three MiGs running around

and six more on the way.

MARSHALL

We're at full throttle.

MARSHALL

Well get `em off me, goddamnit.

FIGHTER PILOT #1

I can't get a lock. Break right.

ALICE

Daddy, look. It says...

MARSHALL

Not now, pumpkin.

FIGHTER PILOT #1

I can't get good tone.

COL. CARLTON

Take the shot.

FIGHTER PILOT #2

Boss, they got one off.

"Missile Locked"

ALICE

Nothing!

MARSHALL

Oh shit. It's got us.

FIGHTER PILOT 11

YAAAAAAAAH!

COL. CARLTON

We got six more bogeys, closing fast

from the south.

COL. CARLTON

Roger that. Kick ass, Navy.

MARSHALL

Uh, we got a problem here.

COL. CARLTON

Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take

you all the way in.

MARSHALL

No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's

not responding.

COL. CARLTON

Lemme take a look.

COL. CARLTON

Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad

out here, sir. Do you have any

elevater control.

MARSHALL

Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.

COL. CARLTON

Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.

COL. CARLTON

I'm sorry, sir.

MARSHALL

Thanks for your help, Colonel.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

They've got no chutes. They can't

control the plane, their engines are

failing and they're losing fuel.

DEAN

I prefered the terrorists.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

That's game, set, and match. There's

nothing to do, except call the Chief

Justice.

V.P. CHANDLER

The Chief Justice? What on earth

for?

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

To swear you in as President.

GENERAL GREELY

Where's your strike team, General?

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

On their way back to Turkey. Why?

GENERAL GREELY

I just had the craziest idea.

MARSHALL

(into header)

Is it our only option? - Then do it.

MARSHALL

We're now over the Black Sea, so

even if they could get us chutes

we'd drown or die of hypothermia

REPORTER

incredible, yet unconfirmed reports,

parachuting from the plane while the

President himself battled these

terrorists.

REPORTER (TELEVISION)

Yet now, in a bizarre twist of events,

CNN has learned that Air Force One

has been severly crippled and is

virtually unlandable and our sources

report that the First Family is

trapped onboard.  A daring mid-air

rescue operation is said to be

underway.

MARSHALL

How long's it been?

SHEPHERD

Twenty five minutes. They should be

here any moment.

MARSHALL

They better. Fuel's almost gone.

ALICE

There they are!

MARSHALL

Okay, I'm slowing us down.

SHEPHERD

IT'S OPEN!

MARSHALL

DO YOU SEE TEEM?

ROSE (O.S.)

CAN YOU SEE THEM?

SHEPHERD

HERE THEY COME!

SHEPHERD

WE'RE HOOKED!

MARSHALL

We're hooked. Hove into position.

KC-LO PILOT (RADIO)

Romeo Tango Zulu, acknowledged. We

are assuming position.

MARSHALL

Get going. We don't have much time

left.

ROSE

I love you. I just wanted you to

know that.

MARSHALL

I love you too.

(beat)

We're going to make it.

ALICE

My school play's Tuesday night.

MARSHALL

I promise.

KC-L0 PILOT
