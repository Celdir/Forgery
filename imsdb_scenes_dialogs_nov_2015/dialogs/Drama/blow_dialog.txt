REGISTRATION WOMAN

Next.

GEORGE (V.O.)

I was standing there, and it was like

the outside of me and the inside of me

didn't match, you know?  And then I

looked around the room and it hit me.  I

saw my whole life.  Where I was gonna

live, what type of car I'd drive, who my

neighbors would be.  I saw it all and I

didn't want it.  Not that life.

GEORGE

There's something out there for me, Dad.

Something different.  Something free

form, you know?  Something for me, and

college just isn't it.

FRED

That's too bad.  You would have been the

first one in the family.

GEORGE

I know.

FRED

Alright.  You want me to get your old

job back?  Because I could, you know, I

could put in that word.

GEORGE

No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I

just don't want...

FRED

What are you going to do?

GEORGE

I'm going to California.

GIRLS

You guys need some help?

TUNA

I don't know about you, but I think

we're gonna like it here.

GEORGE (V.O.)

California was like nothing I'd ever

experienced.  The people were liberated

and independent and full of new ideas.

GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

They used words like "right on,"

"groovy," and "solid."  The women are

all beautiful and seemed to share the

same occupation.

WOMAN #1

I'm a flight attendant.

WOMAN #2

I'm a flight attendant.

WOMAN #3

I'm a flight attendant.

TUNA

Hey, wake up.  Come on, you two

lovebirds.  Hurry, I want to show you

something.

TUNA (CONT'D)

Figured it out.

GEORGE

Figured what out?

TUNA

You know how we were wondering what we

were going to do for money?  Being how

we don't want to get jobs and whatnot?

Well, check this out.

BARBARA

Tuna, this is crap.

TUNA

I know it's not the greatest.  It's

commercial.

BARBARA

It's garbage.

GEORGE

It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal.

What are you gonna do with all this?

TUNA

We sell it.  I got it all figured out.

We make three finger lids and sell them

on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've

made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a

lot of weed for our head.  What do you

think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies

and everything.

BARBARA

You can't sell this to your friends.

TUNA

Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great

idea and you guys have to be all

skeptical.

BARBARA

Look, if you really wanna score some

dope, I got the guy.

GEORGE

Are you sure this guy is cool?

BARBARA

You'll see for yourself.

TUNA

A beauty parlor for men?  Sounds pretty

queer.

GEORGE

Nothing like this back home.

BARBARA

Derek!

DEREK

Barbie!

DEREK (CONT'D)

So, this is the new man, huh?  He's

cute!

GEORGE

George.

TUNA

Tuna.

DEREK

Tuna, oh my.  Enchante, George.  Barbie,

he's yummy.  He looks like a Ken doll.

Oooh, Ken and Barbie.  It's perfect.

Alright, girls, give me five minutes.

DEREK (CONT'D)

Everyone, shoo!  You, too, Barbie.  I

want to talk to the boys alone.

DEREK (CONT'D)

What can I do for you guys?

GEORGE

We want some grass.

DEREK

I know what you want.  But, first of

all, are you cops?

GEORGE

No.

DEREK

Because if you are, you have to tell me.

If not, it's entrapment.

GEORGE

We're not cops.  We're from

Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look

like a cop?

DEREK

I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're

very lucky you're friends of Barbie's.

If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

GEORGE

What the fuck is that?

DEREK

It's your grass.

TUNA

Wow.  That's more than we had in mind.

DEREK

I don't nickel and dime.  You want it or

not?

GEORGE

We'll take it.

GEORGE

This is it for me.

BARBARA

What is?

GEORGE

Just everything.  You.  California.  The

beach.  This spot right here.  I feel

like I belong here, you know?  It just

feels right.

BARBARA

You happy, baby?

GEORGE

Yeah.  I am.

EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY

GEORGE

This is it for me.

BARBARA

What is?

GEORGE

Just everything.  You.  California.  The

beach.  This spot right here.  I feel

like I belong here, you know?  It just

feels right.

BARBARA

You happy, baby?

GEORGE

Yeah.  I am.

TUNA

Look what the cat dragged in.

GEORGE

Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you

doing here?

KEVIN

Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down

the beach, minding my business, when who

did I see but this fucking guy.  I

didn't know you guys were living in

California.

GEORGE

Yeah, but what are you doing out here?

KEVIN

I'm on vacation.  On my way back to

school.

GEORGE

This calls for a joint.  You want to do

the honors?

KEVIN

No, man.  I'm too fucked up.

TUNA

Nice weed, huh?

KEVIN

Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like

it.  I'm fucking wasted.

GEORGE

Right on.

KEVIN

G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm

really...

GEORGE

Stoned?

KEVIN

I wish there was shit like this back

home.

GEORGE

Yeah?

KEVIN

Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money

I could make if I had this stuff back

east?

TUNA

No shit, Kevin?

KEVIN

That's right.

GEORGE

Yeah?

KEVIN

When there's something to move, it's too

easy not to.  Do you know how many

colleges are in a twenty mile radius?

U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....

TUNA

Smith.  Hampshire....

KEVIN

Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a

hundred thousand rich kids with their

parents' money to spend, but there's

never anything available.  Nothing good,

anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars

for shit.

GEORGE

The way we figure it, Barbara flies to

Boston twice a week.  Two bags per

flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.

DEREK

You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred

pounds a week.

GEORGE

Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.

BARBARA

We're gonna call it California

sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.

GEORGE

I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.

DEREK

I don't know...

GEORGE

Here's the best part.  We can charge

five-hundred a pound.

DEREK

Come on, George, no one is going to pay

that.

GEORGE

It's already been negotiated.  It's

done.  The money is there waiting.

DEREK

Goodness.

GEORGE

Goodness is right.  If you do the math,

that's over thirty grand a week profit.

I want you to be my partner on this,

Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen

thousand a week for you, my friend.  In

your pocket, free and clear.

DEREK

And I only deal with you?

GEORGE

Barbara and me.  No one else.

BARBARA

It's gonna work, Derek.

DEREK

I don't know.  East coast.  Airplanes.

It all sounds pretty risky.

GEORGE

She's a flight attendant.  They don't

check her bags.

BARBARA

Any message?

KEVIN

Keep it coming.

KEVIN

More.

KEVIN

I need more.

BARBARA

What do you want me to do?  I can only

take two bags, and I can't fly back here

everyday.

KEVIN

I know, but I've got a feeding frenzy on

my hands.  Tell George this is small

potatoes.  We're missing out on some

serious cash.  You tell George.  He'll

think of something.

KEVIN

Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine.

Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a

thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A

hundred and twenty-eight thousand

dollars.

TUNA

Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just

looking at it.

KEVIN

What's the matter, George?  Something

wrong?  You look like you just fucked

your mother.

TUNA

Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours.

We're fucking rich.

GEORGE

It's not enough.

KEVIN

What?

TUNA

What the fuck are you talking about,

man?

GEORGE

The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all

the legwork, and at the end of the day,

we're still paying retail.  We're

getting middled.

KEVIN

So?

GEORGE

So, we need to get to the source.

TUNA

Source?  What about Derek?

GEORGE

He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's

our partner.  What's good for us is good

for him.

KEVIN

Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we

start?

GEORGE

Who speaks Spanish?

TUNA

This is bullshit, George.  We're never

going to find anything down there.

KEVIN

You know, he's got a point.  We're

fucking Americans.  We stick out like

sore thumbs.

DEREK

I don't think so.

GEORGE

You guys are such babies.  You want to

go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop

until I find the fucking motherlode.

RADA

Georgie, we're gonna get busted if we

keep this up.

GEORGE

We're not gonna get busted.

KEVIN

George, we'll wind up in a Mexican

prison getting fucked up the ass by one

of Maria's relatives.

MARIA

Hey, fuck you, Dulli.  I'm not Mexican.

I'm Italian.

BARBARA

You're Italian?

KEVIN

Yeah, right.  Gonzales.  What is that,

Sicilian?

TUNA

As far as I'm concerned, we're on

fucking vacation.

SANTIAGO

Ramon tells me you are looking for some

mota.

GEORGE

Yes, I am.

SANTIAGO

For instance, something like this?

GEORGE

Very nice.  I'll take it.

SANTIAGO

Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how

much will you be needing?

GEORGE

All of it.  As much as you've got.  A

couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back

in a week with a plane.

SANTIAGO

Listen, Americano, it is very nice to

meet you, but maybe we are going too

fast.  You take a little and then come

back.

GEORGE

I don't need a little.  I need a lot.

SANTIAGO

Marijuana is illegal in my country, and

I believe in yours, as well.  We must be

careful.

GEORGE

What if I brought you, let's say, fifty

thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate

some of your concerns?

SANTIAGO

Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand

dollars, and I have no more concerns.

TUNA

I can't believe we're stealing a plane.

KEVIN

Don't be such a pussy.

GEORGE

It's fine.  We're not stealing it.

We're borrowing it.  And try to look

natural.  We've got company.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Be cool.

TUNA

You guys are fucking insane.

GEORGE

Alright, pull back the throttle...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Not that far, only halfway.  You sure

you know what you're doing?

KEVIN

Relax.  I've flown with my old man a

million times.  And he always told me,

the taking off part is easy, it's the

landing you've got to worry about.

AMIGOS

Hola, George!  Bienvenido!

SANTIAGO

Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man

of your word.

GEORGE

Actually, I've got some news.  That

fifty thousand I promised you, I

couldn't get it.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

So I brought you sixty.

GEORGE

Are you sure you want to do this in

front of everyone?

DEREK

Don't be ridiculous, these are my

babies.

DEREK (CONT'D)

George, you're a genius.  We're rich.

Come, children.

DEREK (CONT'D)

George, get my camera.

DEREK (CONT'D)

Take a picture of me, George.  Take a

picture of me with my new friends.

It'll be a fabulous Christmas card.

GEORGE

Should we buy it?

BARBARA

Are you kidding?

GEORGE

We'll take it.

MEXICAN BOY

Picture?

ERMINE

I just can't get over the size of that

ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at

it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.

FRED

I'm just happy that George has found

someone he cares for.

ERMINE

Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about

that ring.  It's something else.  Let me

tell you.

BARBARA

George has exquisite taste.

ERMINE

What is that, two carats?  That's got to

be two carats.

BARBARA

I don't know.

ERMINE

Yes.  It's at least two carats, darling.

Treasure it.

FRED

Hard to imagine being able to afford a

ring like that on a construction salary.

GEORGE

Well, you know.  It's um...

ERMINE

Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat

mouth.  You don't buy it all at once.

It's called layaway.

FRED

Layaway shmayaway.

ERMINE

That's right.  Layaway.  Something you

wouldn't know anything about, you

cheapskate.

FRED

Who's the cheapskate?

ERMINE

You, you big old tightwad.  He still has

his communion money.  Tell him, George.

Tell your father about layaway.

GEORGE

Yeah, layaway.

ERMINE

The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a

killjoy.

FRED

Killjoy?

GEORGE

Honey, your nose!

BARBARA

Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.

ERMINE

Barbara, here, take my napkin.

BARBARA

Thanks.  I'll be okay.

GEORGE

You wanna split?

BARBARA

Yeah, I don't feel so well.

GEORGE

Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's

get the check.

GEORGE

Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.

BARBARA

I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging

nosebleeds.

GEORGE

I'm taking you to the doctor when we get

home, and I don't want to hear any

arguments.

BARBARA

Would you be bummed out if I didn't go

to Chicago with you?

GEORGE

No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right.

You fly home and get some rest.

BARBARA

Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in

front of your parents.

GEORGE

Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they?

I wanted to shoot myself.

BARBARA

Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they

were kind of cute.

GEORGE

Promise me that we'll never be like

them.  I don't want to wind up like

that.

BARBARA

Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up

like us.

GEORGE (V.O.)

I had a little problem in Chicago.

Something about trying to sell a

truckload of dope to an undercover

officer.  So I applied the three rules

of the game under if and when arrested.

GEORGE (V.O.)

Rule one: don't fight.  A trial will

cost you a fortune in lawyer's fees and

the jury will chop off your balls and

hand them to you on a platter.

JUDGE

George Jung, you have been accused of

possession of six-hundred and sixty

pounds of marijuana with intent to

distribute.  How do you plead?

GEORGE (V.O.)

Rule two: plead not guilty and get

bailed out of jail.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Your honor, I'd like to say a few words

to the court.

JUDGE

By all means.

GEORGE

In all honesty, I don't feel like what

I've done is a crime and I think it's

illogical and irresponsible for you to

sentence me to prison.  None of the real

criminals of the world ever end up

behind bars.  I mean, when you think

about it, what did I really do?  Cross

an imaginary line with a bunch of

plants?  You say that I'm an outlaw, you

say that I'm a thief, but where's the

Christmas dinner for the people on

relief?

JUDGE

Those are very interesting concepts you

have, Mr. Jung.

Unfortunately for you, the imaginary

line you crossed is real, the plants you

brought with you are illegal, and what

you did constitutes a crime.

JUDGE (CONT'D)

Bail is set at twenty-thousand dollars.

BARBARA

Surprise.

GEORGE

Baby, you didn't have to come.

BARBARA

What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not

a chance.  So, what's the verdict?

GEORGE

Lawyer says he can plead it down to five

years.  I'll serve two.

BARBARA

Two years.  George, I can't wait that

long.

GEORGE

What?  You're not going to wait for me?

BARBARA

George, I went to the doctor.  I don't

have two years.

GEORGE (V.O.)

Which brings me to rule number three:

which says, fuck rules one and two, skip

bail and take off.

GEORGE (V.O.)

Time is such a funny thing.  I look at

where I am now, and in here, time inches

along.  So slow, it hardly seems like it

moves.  But back then, time went fast.

GEORGE

It went too fast.

GEORGE

Hi, Mom.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Surprised to see me?

ERMINE

Take your boots off.  You're tan.

GEORGE

Mexico.

ERMINE

Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want

you to know I'm deeply sorry about your

girlfriend.

GEORGE

Barbara.

ERMINE

Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.

GEORGE

Thank you.  Have you been getting the

money I sent you?

ERMINE

You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.

ERMINE (CONT'D)

G-d, son.

GEORGE

Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?

GEORGE

May the wind always be at your back and

the sun always upon your face...

FRED

...and the winds of destiny carry you

aloft...

BOTH

...to dance with the stars.

FRED

You alright?

GEORGE

Just low.

FRED

You loved her, didn't you?  You really

loved her.

GEORGE

Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I

gonna do?

FRED

Tough spot.

GEORGE

You mad at me?

FRED

Not mad.

GEORGE

Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way

you look at me.

FRED

I just don't know what you're thinking.

I don't understand your choices.  You

know, the police are looking for you.

GEORGE

I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I

mean, I'm really great.

FRED

Let me tell you something, son.  You

would have been great at anything.

FRED (CONT'D)

Where are you going?

ERMINE

George!

TROUT

George Jung, you are under arrest.

FRED

Open the door, son.

ERMINE

I had no choice.

ERMINE (CONT'D)

Don't look at me like that.  What was I

supposed to do?  You're in our house.

What, was I supposed to be an

accomplice?

ERMINE (CONT'D)

You don't think people know you're a

drug dealer?  Everyone knows.  It's no

secret.  How do you think that reflects

on me?  Every time I go out, I'm

humiliated.  I see the stares.  I hear

the whispers.  How do you think that

makes me feel?  Did you ever once stop

and think of me?

ERMINE (CONT'D)

So you go to jail.  It's for your own

good.  You need to straighten your life

out.

GUARD

Prisoner in.

GUARD (CONT'D)

Prisoner in.

DIEGO DELGADO

My name is Diego Delgado.  How do you

do?

DIEGO

If you don't mind me asking, what is the

reason you are in this place?

GEORGE

What?

DIEGO

Your offense?  Why are you here?

GEORGE

I don't want to talk about it.

DIEGO

Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to

know my crime?

GEORGE

Not really, no.

DIEGO

No?

GEORGE

I don't like a lot of conversation,

Diego.

DIEGO

Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah,

blah is no good.  But we are roommates,

okay?  And we must talk to each other.

I am arrested for stealing cars.  For

the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it

is your turn.  Now you will tell me,

okay?  You will tell me why you are

here?

DIEGO (CONT'D)

Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be

friends, we must trust each other.

GEORGE

Murder.

DIEGO

Ah, yes.  The murder.

GEORGE

What do you got there, Diego?

DIEGO

Nothing.  Just a little project.

GEORGE

What kind of project?

DIEGO

Never mind.  Not for you to worry.

GEORGE

I thought you said we were roommates.

That we should talk about everything.

DIEGO

You have your intrigues.  I have mine.

This is a happy day for me, George.

Nine months from today, I will be in

Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine

months, I am free.  How much time do you

have?

GEORGE

Twenty-six months.

DIEGO

Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must

be your lawyer.

GEORGE

I've got to get out of here, Diego.

DIEGO

Only two ways I know to leave here

early.  One is to escape.

GEORGE

What's the other one?

GEORGE

Alright, let's open our books.

INMATE #1

Man, fuck you.

INMATE #2

We ain't opening shit.

INMATE #1

You just the warden's boy.  We on to

you.  You just trying to knock some time

off, asskissing motherfucker.

GEORGE

Alright.  You're right.  I want to get

out of this shithole as fast as I can.

And I don't want to do this any more

than you do.  But for me to walk early,

some of you have to graduate.  You,

forget about it.  You're hopeless, go to

sleep.

INMATE #3

Damn, homeboy, you got ruined.

GEORGE

But the rest of you could get diplomas

and get jobs when you're on the outside.

INMATE #1

Shit, I'm in for life.

INMATE #2

I'm a criminal.  I ain't getting no

motherfucking job.

GEORGE

We can learn some criminal shit, too.

Alright, I'll make you a deal.  What if

half the time, we learn about George

Washington, and the other half, I'll

teach you how to smuggle drugs?

INMATE #2

Man, you don't know dick about smuggling

no drugs.

GEORGE

I was arrested in Chicago with six

hundred and sixty pounds of grass.  I

think that qualifies me.

INMATE #1

How did you get a hold of six-hundred

and sixty pounds of dope?

GEORGE

Flew it in from Mexico on a single

engine Cessna.  Now, do we have a deal

or not?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Alright, the first thing you need to

know about smuggling drugs is that it's

easy.  The DEA are a bunch of losers.

They couldn't find their dicks in a

whorehouse.  They don't know what the

fuck they're doing...

DIEGO

George?  Hey, George?  I listen to what

you say to the class today about the

smuggling.  You are a magico, ah?

DIEGO (CONT'D)

I never believed you were a murderer.  I

knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have

seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.

GEORGE

I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.

DIEGO

You like to make the boundaries

disappear.  It's not only the money, is

it, George?  The adventure is part of

the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?

GEORGE

Good night.

DIEGO

In my country, I am a magico.  A man

with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To

take nothing and make it something,

okay?  I have failed my dream, but I

will accomplish.  That is why I am in

your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom.

But they do not take my dream.  Do you

have a dream, George?

GEORGE

I would if I could get some sleep.

DIEGO

Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you

accomplish your dream.  But yet you

failed.  Why?

GEORGE

Because I got caught.

DIEGO

No, my brother.

GEORGE

Because they caught me?

DIEGO

You failed because you had the wrong

dream.

DIEGO (CONT'D)

George?  What do you know about cocaine?

GEORGE

I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good

thing going already.  Everybody smokes

pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich

man's drug.  It's too expensive.

DIEGO

No, no.  That is where you are wrong.

For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we

buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN

Miami, we sell for sixty.

GEORGE

That's over fifty-thousand dollars

profit per kilo.

DIEGO

And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few

times and retail, you're looking at two,

three-hundred thousand.

GEORGE

Oh my G-d.

DIEGO

Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than

a kilo of your precious marijuana.

Everything is the same, George, except

instead of thousands, you are making

millions.

GEORGE

Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.

DIEGO

Now do you see what I am saying?

GEORGE

Getting it here is no problem.  Trust

me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to.

What about supply?  How much can we get?

DIEGO

Don't worry.  We will talk of

everything.  We have the time.  You

arrive here with a Bachelor of

Marijuana, but you will leave with a

Doctorate of Cocaine.

DIEGO

What type of planes do you have?

GEORGE

Four passenger, single engine Cessna.

DIEGO

How many kilos can we fit in these

planes?

GEORGE

I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and

fifty.  How many miles is it from

Colombia to Miami?

DIEGO

Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop

somewhere to refuel.

GEORGE

We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know

someone there.

DIEGO

Great.  I love the Bahamas.

GEORGE

Diego Delgado, please?

DIEGO

Allo?

GEORGE

Diego?  It's George.

DIEGO

George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah?

Are you out?

GEORGE

Yeah, I'm out.

DIEGO

Congratulations, brother.  I've been

waiting for you.

GEORGE

How are we doing?

DIEGO

Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything

is fine down here.  Everything is all

set up.

GEORGE

Do we need a plane?  How does this work?

When do I see you?

DIEGO

Slow down, George.  Slow down.

DIEGO (CONT'D)

You need to come down here, everybody

meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha.

We do one for good faith and then we

talk about airplanes.

GEORGE

I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on

parole.  I can't leave the state.

DIEGO

But you must.  It's the only way.

GEORGE

I just got released five minutes ago.

DIEGO

George, are we gonna do this or not?

GEORGE

Good to see you, Diego.

DIEGO

Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The

water.  The women.  It's better than

Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some

friends I would like you to meet.

DIEGO

Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each

suitcase.  You receive a hundred

thousand dollars upon delivery.

GEORGE

Okay.

CESAR

Not so fast.  I would like to go over

the details.

GEORGE

What details?  I put the coke in the

false bottoms and take it through

customs.

CESAR

Tell me about the suitcases.  What is

the make and the color?

DIEGO

Samsonites.  Red.  No tags.

CESAR

Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in

the suitcase?

GEORGE

What?  Yeah, sure.

CESAR

Whose cloths?  Your clothes?

GEORGE

My clothes, your clothes.  What does it

matter?

CESAR

I would like to know the contents.

Every detail is important.

GEORGE

What are we doing here, Diego?  This

guy's a clown.  He's talking about

clothes.

CESAR

I demand to know everything.  I do not

trust six-hundred thousand dollars of

coca to someone I don't know.

GEORGE

It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss

fifteen kilos.

CESAR

The coca is my responsibility!

GEORGE

You're a fucking amateur!

DIEGO

Gentlemen, please.  There is no need to

be impolite.  Cesar, this will be fine.

You have my word.  George, Cesar is just

being thorough.  That's all.

CESAR

Very well.  But just remember, Mr. Jung.

I will be with you the whole way.  And I

will be watching.

GEORGE (V.O.)

When you're carrying drugs across the

border, the idea is to remain calm.  The

way I do it is to think of something

pleasant, a fun party, a moment of

triumph.  A sexual encounter.  I

actually project myself to that place.

Anything to keep your mind off the fact

that you're going to jail for a very

long time if they find the fifteen kilos

of cocaine in your suitcases.

CUSTOMS AGENT

On vacation?

GEORGE

Yes.

CUSTOMS AGENT

On vacation for only one day?

GEORGE

(weak smile)

My brother's wedding.  Imagine that,

huh?

CUSTOMS AGENT

Open your bags, please.

CUSTOMS AGENT (CONT'D)

Whose clothes are these?

GEORGE

Mine.

CUSTOMS AGENT

And this?

GEORGE

What can I tell you?  Different strokes.

CUSTOMS AGENT

Alright, go ahead.

DIEGO

Three-hundred kilos it is, then.

DIEGO (CONT'D)

Has everyone met Inez?  This is George.

I've told you about him.  And this is

friend, Jack Stevens.

DIEGO (CONT'D)

Try to be more respectful, darling.  My

apologies.  But she is mistrustful of

Americans.  Shall we proceed?  Let's

hear it again, Mr. Stevens.

STEVENS

I'll fly down on a Friday, refuel in the

Bahamas, and then to Medellin.

INEZ

Friday?

DIEGO

Please, continue.

GEORGE

We make the pick-up, refuel once more in

the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with

the mom and pop traffic.

CESAR

Why are you speaking?

GEORGE

Excuse me?

CESAR

You.  Your responsibility is over.  You

do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You

are not a distributor.  You introduced

us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his

airplane.  That is all.  You make a

percentage.  A generous one.  And you're

lucky to get that.

GEORGE

I see.  How much?

CESAR

Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo.

For everyone.  For you, and you, and

you.

CESAR (CONT'D)

There is no negotiation.  Three-million

dollars.  That is all.

STEVENS

I want two.

GEORGE

Gee, Jack, a million each had such a

nice ring to it.

STEVENS

No way.  I'm doing all the work.  Taking

all the risk, and it's my plane.

STEVENS (CONT'D)

Hey, you guys don't have to do shit.

Just sit back and collect your money.

GEORGE

You good with this?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Alright.

DIEGO

You will watch what you say.  Especially

around George.  He is my brother and he

speaks as good Spanish as you.

DIEGO (CONT'D)

Okay.  That's enough.

INEZ

Get your hands off me.

CESAR

Do you have pictures of your kids?

STEVENS

What?

CESAR

I'll need to see them.  Also need their

names and the names of their schools.

We are trusting you with ninety million

dollars worth of coca, Mr. Stevens.

Without your children, there is no deal.

STEVENS

Fine.  So if that's all, I'll be leaving

now.

CESAR

Don't forget the pictures.

DIEGO (O.S.)

George.  George, come in here.

DIEGO

What's the matter, George?

GEORGE

What's the matter?  We're moving three

hundred fucking kilos and we're making

dogshit.

DIEGO

A million dollars for our first run is

not bad, George.

GEORGE

It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might

as well be hauling suitcases across the

border.  We're getting screwed.

DIEGO

I know.

GEORGE

And what happens when these guys stop

paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are

going to cut us out.  Then where are we?

DIEGO

That's my George, always thinking.

DIEGO (CONT'D)

This is only part of the business,

George.  A very small part.  Don't

worry, there is so much more to do.

Which reminds me, I need a favor from

you.  I must go to Colombia.

GEORGE

What is it, George?  Because I have to

get home.  I've got a parole officer

waiting for me.

DIEGO

I need you to go to Miami.

GEORGE

I'm George.  Friend of Diego's?

ALESSANDRO

QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?

GEORGE

I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.

ALESSANDRO

Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains

everything.  Open your mouth, George.

ALESSANDRO (CONT'D)

Now, you listen to me.  Are you hearing

me?

ALESSANDRO (CONT'D)

You see this?

ALESSANDRO (CONT'D)

I've been holding this shit for him for

three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't

appreciate it.  You tell him I want my

money by Friday.  Can you do that?

GEORGE

Um-hmm.

ERMINE

You have a phone call.

DIEGO (O.S.)

George.

GEORGE

Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you?

It's been eleven days and these guys

want their fucking money.

DIEGO (O.S.)

Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.

GEORGE

Well, you better get here fast.  I'm

sitting on...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Hi, Mom.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I'm sitting on fifty fucking keys.  Get

your ass up here.

DIEGO

It's a little hard to get away right

now.  I'm afraid you're on your own.

MR. T

What we're doing is measuring the

purity.  Pure coke melts out a hundred

and eighty-five, a hundred and ninety

degrees.  Cutting agents melt much

lower.  About a hundred degrees.

Quality product starts melting at a

hundred and forty degrees.  That's what

I'm hoping for.

MR. T (CONT'D)

Good.

MR. T (CONT'D)

Jesus Christ.

MR. T (CONT'D)

Holy fucking Mary!  Jesus, fuck me

running!  Where did you get this shit!

MR. T (CONT'D)

Damn!  Can I do a fucking line?!

GEORGE

What did I tell you?

DEREK

It's great and everything, but what am I

going to do with all this?

GEORGE

Sell it?

DIEGO

Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in

two years, and you show up at my door

with a hundred and ten pounds of

cocaine?

GEORGE

Just sell it, Derek.

DEREK

Alright, but it's gonna take me a year.

DIEGO

Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it.

Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.

GEORGE

I think it's fair to say you

underestimated the market there, Derek.

DIEGO

Touche.

GEORGE

But to the victor belong the spoils.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Half a million for you.  Half a million

for me.  One-point-three five for the

Colombians.

DEREK

Nice doing business with you, George.

GEORGE

Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?

ALESSANDRO

Greetings, Mr. George.

GEORGE

Where do you guys want to count?

ALESSANDRO

On the plane.

GEORGE

What plane?  We going someplace?  Where

we headed?  You have your money.  It's

all there.  What the fuck is going on?

DIEGO

George, good to see you, my brother.

GEORGE

What the fuck is going on?  When did you

get out of jail?

DIEGO

Pablo used his influence.  Now, George,

watch what you say.  Everybody hears

everything.  A lot of things get said

and done that, well, let's just say this

isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you

know?  No offense, but you know what I'm

saying?

GEORGE

Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do

the talking.

DIEGO

Right.  Now who is the person in

California?  The connection?

GEORGE

Just a friend.

DIEGO

Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind.

We'll talk about it later.

GEORGE

Yeah.  You do the talking.

LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN

He will see you now.

(to Diego)

Not you.

DIEGO

There must be some kind of mistake.

LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN

No mistake.  Mr. Escobar will see Mr.

Jung alone.  You are to wait here.

DIEGO

It's alright, George.  You go.

LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN

This way, please.

ESCOBAR

So, this is the man who takes fifty

kilos and makes them disappear in one

day?

GEORGE

Actually, it was three.

ESCOBAR

The man who gives us the airplanes.  The

man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago.

Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to

open for us the gates of Hollywood,

George?

GEORGE

It would be my pleasure.

ESCOBAR

Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend.

Welcome to my country.

ESCOBAR (CONT'D)

The man in the garden.  He was full of

courage.

GEORGE

Un sapo?

ESCOBAR

Un rata - no good.  But he could have

run, fled the country.  Gone to the

policia.  But then his wife, his

children, his parents, his friends, many

people would die.

GEORGE

Yes.

ESCOBAR

But, never mind.  I am thinking we can

do much together.  This problem with

Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very

silly business.  To release him from the

carcel, it causes me much inconvenience.

The fifty kilos could have been a big

problem.  And I don't like problems.

GEORGE

With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my

partner.  I do not do business without

him.

ESCOBAR

I like you, George.  You are loyal.

That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe

crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You

are like me.  I look at you and I see

myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?

GEORGE

Yes, it is.

ESCOBAR

So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine

for me in your country, George?

GEORGE

Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.

ESCOBAR

As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very

good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let

us drive.  We have much to talk about.

ESCOBAR

I like to come up here.  To make the

decisions.  To be one with nature.

GEORGE

It's beautiful.

ESCOBAR

People tell me that I am crazy.  That my

business will never work in your

country.  What do you think, George?

GEORGE

What do I think?  I don't want my answer

to be influenced by what I want, so I'm

going to have to say I don't know.

ESCOBAR

Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do

you want, George?

GEORGE

I want money.

ESCOBAR

Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?

GEORGE

Freedom.

ESCOBAR

Power?

GEORGE

Yeah, maybe.

ESCOBAR

Family.

GEORGE

Sure.

ESCOBAR

Beautiful girls?

GEORGE

Keep them coming.

ESCOBAR

Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You

are right.  But money.

GEORGE

Money.

ESCOBAR

And Diego?

GEORGE

Diego is my brother.

ESCOBAR

Good.  Take care of him, George.  I'm

fond of him, but he is sometimes like a

baby.  Keep an eye on him, okay?

DIEGO

Padrino.

ESCOBAR

Diego, mijo.  I've made a decision.  We

are going into business and I would like

to start right away.

GEORGE

Three million.  I counted it twice.

DIEGO

It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.

GEORGE

I'm calling it three.

DIEGO

We're half a million off.

GEORGE

Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.

DIEGO

Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's

three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point

five.

GEORGE

I don't give a shit.  Close enough.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Where do I put this!?

DIEGO

Try the back bedroom.

GEORGE

There's no room.

DIEGO

Try the closet.

GEORGE

We've got to do something about this.

GEORGE

Are you comfortable with this?

DIEGO

George, we've got sixty-one million

dollars.  It's either here or someplace

else.  We've got to put it somewhere.

Unless you want to launder it.

GEORGE

And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.

DIEGO

Then relax.  It's a federal bank.

Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor

Noriega has very lenient banking

principles.  No questions.  No problems.

All the pesados keep their money here.

Even El Padrino.  What do you worry?

Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who

is going to fuck with us?

GEORGE

I love it.

BANK PRESIDENT

I'm sorry.

GEORGE

I give you thirty-million dollars and

you give me this little book.

DIEGO

I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't

believe it.  Can you believe I'm

married, George?

GEORGE

You're a lucky man, Diego.

DIEGO

I love you, my brother, do you know

that?

GEORGE

I love you too, man.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I'll be right back, Diego.

INEZ

Look, honey, a power boat.

DIEGO

Great, baby, great!

GEORGE

Hello.

MIRTHA

Hello.

GEORGE

Do I know you?

MIRTHA

I don't think so.

GEORGE

Why are you smiling?

MIRTHA

Why are you smiling?

GEORGE

I don't know.  My name is George.

MIRTHA

I know who you are, El Americano.

Mister George.

GEORGE

What is your name?

CESAR

Mr. Jung, I see you've met my fiancee,

Mirtha.

GEORGE

Mirtha.

CESAR

Diego needs to see you right away,

please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.

AUGUSTO

Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I

am Augusto Oliveras.

GEORGE

My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me

much about you.

RAMON OCHOA

Congratulations on your conquest of the

West Coast.   How much bigger can we

get?

GEORGE

Sky's the limit.  We're just beginning

to tap the market.  If it's accepted by

actors and musicians, the rest will

follow.

AUGUSTO

We are talking about George's West Coast

operation.

DIEGO

Ah, George's mystery man.

RAFAEL OJEDA

Yes, where is this man?  When do we meet

him?

DIEGO

You don't meet him.  George keeps this a

secret.  He's here meeting everyone,

goes to Colombia and meets Pablo, but

still keeps his secrets.  Even from his

brother.

JUAN CARLOS "THE GUAPO"

Come on, George, we're all in this

together.

EMILIO OCHOA

Yes, George, there's enough for

everybody.

GEORGE

I think Padroni is happy with the

current situation.  Will you please

excuse me?

MIRTHA

You better know what you're doing,

George.  You're playing with fire.

GEORGE

I like fire.

MIRTHA

I do.

MIRTHA (CONT'D)

I need a fucking drink.

GEORGE

Jesus Christ.

MIRTHA

Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite.

I quit smoking, didn't I?

GEORGE

Put that shit away, they're here.

ERMINE

It's all so beautiful.

MIRTHA

What do you think, Dad?

FRED

Yeah.  Nice.

ERMINE

Look at this credenza.  If you don't

mind me asking, how much is something

like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.

GEORGE

(quickly)

It's a family heirloom.

ERMINE

I've seen those in magazines.  They're

not cheap.

GEORGE

Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.

ERMINE

Oh, I see.

MIRTHA

Come on.  I'll show you the rest of the

house.

GEORGE

So, business is going good.  I've got

this import/export thing going on in

Miami that's been very profitable.  With

my investments...

FRED

Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see

you very much, I don't want to waste the

time.

FRED (CONT'D)

You come from my body, remember?  You're

my baby boy.  The same kid who would

jump off a mountain if someone told him

he couldn't do it.  You haven't changed

much.  I know the things you do.  Not

everything.  But I get the picture and I

don't care.  I don't like it.  It's not

what I would have chosen for you, but

it's your life.  It doesn't have

anything to do with me.

FRED (CONT'D)

You're like your mother.  You love

money.

GEORGE

Dad.

FRED

No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's

good if it makes you happy.  It's nice

to have nice things.  Are you happy,

son?

GEORGE

Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.

DIEGO

Three years.  How long have we been in

business?  Three years.  Does she get to

meet your connection?  Was she good

enough?

GEORGE

Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be

here any minute.  I'm trying to

concentrate.

DIEGO

I'm very angry with you, George.  Very

angry.  You don't take me to California,

but you take your bitch wife?  A woman?

I understand you love her, but it was

you and me who started this.  You and

me.

GEORGE

What do you need my connection for,

Diego?  What are you going to do with

it?

DIEGO

What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's

for peace of mind.  It's for the

principle.

GEORGE

Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't

telling you.  It's just business.  Now,

shut up.  You're driving me crazy.

DIEGO

I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're

driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What

happened to our dream?

TONY

Algun problema?

GEORGE

No no no... no problema, amigo.  El

dinero esta todo aqui.

Lleves las "llaves" y mas tarde lo

contaremos.  Okay?  No problem.

TONY

Que problema?  Nosotros esperamos.

DIEGO

(English)

You embarrassed me, George.  You make me

look very bad.

BENNY

Que esta diciendo?

GEORGE

Nothing.  Todo esta bien.

DIEGO

(English)

Everything is not alright.  I bring you

in, and you slap my fucking face!

GEORGE

This is not the time, Diego.

TONY

Hay algun problema?  Hablame!

DIEGO

(English)

You fucked me in front of my whole

family!

GEORGE

Fuck you...I didn't fuck you.

BENNY

Maldita sea, que diablos esta diciendo?

GEORGE

Esta todo aqui, amigo...take the keys.

Take 'em and go.

TONY

Que esta pasando aqui, jefe?

DIEGO

Sientese ye no se meta en lo que no le

importa.

GEORGE

Take it easy!  Everything's okay!

DIEGO

Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas

campesinos?

GEORGE

Take the fucking keys!

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is

alright.  There's no problem.  Okay?

This never happened.  No one has to know

anything about this.  Diego, I want you

to calmly tell them where the fucking

coke is.  Do it now.

DIEGO

Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.

GEORGE

No problem, gentlemen.  Goodbye.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Derek Foreal.

DIEGO

What?

GEORGE

Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek

fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to

all your dreams.  Are you happy now?

FRED

Hello, hello.

AUGUSTO

I'm so glad you two could make it.

Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You

look like you're about to burst.

MIRTHA

Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?

AUGUSTO

I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the

bar.  And if you find her, tell her to

come, it's almost midnight.

AUGUSTO (CONT'D)

It's good you came down, George.  We

need to discuss a few things.

DIEGO

Where's Diego?

AUGUSTO

He's not here, George.

GEORGE

Yeah, well where is he?  And who is this

Norman K. guy?  That's all anyone is

talking about.  Norman K.  Norman K.  Do

I know him?

AUGUSTO

Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an

island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From

what they say, it is free and it's

Diego's new home.

GEORGE

What?

AUGUSTO

Let us walk.  From what I understand,

Diego has bought a hundred and sixty

acres, a marina, a hotel, and an

airstrip.

GEORGE

Motherfucker works fast.

AUGUSTO

The word is that soon he is to be king

of the middle empire.  He is doing

multiple runs right now and using the

island as a jump-off point.

GEORGE

He what?

AUGUSTO

Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very

busy man.  Along with many others.  You

shouldn't stay away so long.

GEORGE

That's impossible.  We can't be up and

running.  Who's distributing?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Oh, no.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Hello, Derek?  This is George.  Am I

wearing lipstick?

I said, am I wearing lipstick?  Because

when I'm getting fucked, I want to make

sure my face is pretty.  You're buying

directly from Diego, aren't you, you son

of a bitch?

DEREK

I don't want to get caught in the middle

of this.  That's between you and Diego.

DEREK (CONT'D)

It's nothing personal, George.  Just

business.

GEORGE

Yeah.  I understand.  Just business.

Right.  Fuck you.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I bring you in, and this is how you

repay me?  You little homo!  Hey, Derek?

Derek?

MIRTHA

Que va hacer?

AUGUSTO

Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va

hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.

MARIA

Alguna cosa tiene que hacer.

FAMILY MEMBER #2

De otra manera, es un marica.

FAMILY MEMBER #2

Mira, vos sos responsable por el exito

de Diego.

FAMILY MEMBER #3

El se esta burlando de vos.  Debes hacer

algo, hombre.

MARIA

No Puedes hacer ni un culo.

AUGUSTO

El no va hacer nada.  Hay un problema.

Aqui, hubo un error y nosotros lo vamos

ha arreglar.

BLANCA

No le escusches a mi yerno.  A el solo

le importa la plata.

BLANCA (CONT'D)

Vos lo tenes que matar, ahorita mismo.

De lo contrario vas a quedar como un

marica sin horror.

FAMILY MEMBER #3

Mejor dicho vos sos un aculillado.

FAMILY MEMBER #1

Maricon.

BLANCA

Sabes que, vos no tenes pantalones.

Nadie te va a respetar.  Usa esto.  Deja

solo un huequito tan pequeno, que ni

sangre le va a salir a ese malparido del

Diego.

AUGUSTO

Blanca, por favor.

MIRTHA

Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va

a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su

tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta.

El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar,

le va a hechar un hijueputa carro

encima.

AUGUSTO

Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan!

Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George,

debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica

manera, mano.

GEORGE

No, no, no, no yo puedo arregarlo solo.

CESAR

Good to see you, George.  It's been a

long time.

DIEGO

George, I am happy to see you.  How are

you, my brother?

GEORGE

No more brothers, Diego.

DIEGO

Of course we are brothers.  Why do you

say that?   You hurt me, George.

GEORGE

You fucked me, Diego.

DIEGO

I did not.

GEORGE

You went behind my back and you cut me

out.

DIEGO

No, I never.  I would not do that,

George.  Never.

GEORGE

I talked to Foreal, Diego.

DIEGO

Maybe you are right.  I did betray you a

little bit.

DIEGO (CONT'D)

Oh, boo hoo, boo hoo.  So sad, George.

I stole your California connection.  So

what?  Who introduced you to Pablo

Escobar?  Me.  Who introduced you to

your fucking Colombian wife?  Me.  Who

protected you when my friend Cesar Roza

wanted to slice your fucking throat,

huh?  Who mad you millions and millions

of dollars?  Me.  And what do I get in

return?  This?  Accusations?  I have

always given you everything, George, but

that is over now.  This is my operation.

My dream.  So go home, George.  Go back

to your stupid little life.  You can

sell half grams to your fucking

relatives for all I care.  Because you

are out!

GEORGE

You'd better kill me now, Diego, because

you're a dead man.

DIEGO

George, don't be so emotional.  This is

business.  Besides, I can't kill you,

you are my brother.

CESAR

Say "hi" to your pretty wife for me.

ESCOBAR

George, you look terrible.

GEORGE

Yeah, well...

ESCOBAR

Diego?

GEORGE

Yeah.

ESCOBAR

Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some

scotch.

GEORGE

I didn't come here to drink scotch.

ESCOBAR

I see.  I'm sorry about this, George.

I'm not happy about this situation.

It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus

is.

GEORGE

You know why I'm here.  You know what I

have to do.  I came here for permission.

Out of respect, Pablo.  This is

bullshit, he's making me look like a

punk.

ESCOBAR

It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a

lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the

money.  You were an excellent teacher,

George.  When the student has learned

well, the teacher is no longer

necessary.  We must remember we have

wives, friends, familia.  Even familia

that has not been born.  But sometimes,

we must forget as well.  I am like you.

I must teach the lesson.  We want to

teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We

must remember that life is the teacher.

GEORGE

You're saying life will take care of

Diego?

ESCOBAR

Life will take care of everybody.

Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.

GEORGE

I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo.

You know the DEA knows about Norman's

Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships

Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's

fucked up!

ESCOBAR

I'm sorry, George.

GEORGE

Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You

and me, Pablo?  Are we good?

ESCOBAR

Of course, George.  We are beautiful.

We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not

like Diego.  We started this, George.

ESCOBAR (CONT'D)

And, George?  The vengance?  It is best

served cold.

MIRTHA

George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look

at you.

GEORGE

Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright.

It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm

out.

MIRTHA

Pablo said no?

GEORGE

Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm

never going back.  I have you.  We have

the baby.  And there's nothing else.

It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep

now.

ERMINE

George, it's time!  George!  George!

GEORGE

Coming!

GEORGE (V.O.)

Watching my baby girl born did something

to me.

They talk about religious experiences, I

didn't believe in religion.  But when

Kristina Sunshine Jung came into this

world, something in me changed.  I

looked at her and I knew right then that

I could never love anything but my

daughter ever again.  It sounds sappy,

but it was like, click, I knew what I

was put on this planet for.  It was the

greatest feeling I ever had followed by

the worst feeling I ever had.

NURSE

He fainted.

MIRTHA

George!

DR. BAY

He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart

is racing.  Have you been using drugs?

GEORGE

Coke.

DR. BAY

Cocaine?  How much?

GEORGE

I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.

DR. BAY

In how long?  A week?

GEORGE

Today.

DR. BAY

Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and

start an i.v. stat!  This man is having

a heart attack.

DR. BAY

I've reviewed your toxicology report

three times, George.  I've never seen

anything like it.  Eighteen grams.

The lethal dose is a gram and a half.

You should be in the Guiness Book.

DR. BAY (CONT'D)

It's not funny, George.  You should be

dead right now.  Absolutely.  I cannot

come up with one logical explanation for

why you're still breathing.  I'm not

here to give you lectures, I've got no

moral interest in what you do.  But,

take it easy, George.  Stay with us a

while.  You've got a daughter now.

GEORGE

Come on.  Come on, honey.  You can do

it.  Come to Daddy.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Good girl!

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.

MIRTHA

She did that before.

GEORGE

No.  These are her first steps.  Watch

her.

MIRTHA

Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.

GEORGE

But this is...

MIRTHA

I said, I've seen it before.

GEORGE

Alright.

MIRTHA

Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.

GEORGE

Where are you going?

MIRTHA

Out.

DEREK

Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited

me.

GEORGE

Yeah.  She told me.

DEREK

Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I

feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I

did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me.

Cut me out, too.

GEORGE

I heard.

DEREK

I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who

my friends were.

GEORGE

It's in the past.  I'm out of the

business now, so forget about it.  No

hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And

besides, I'm sorry, too.

DEREK

You?

GEORGE

For calling you a homo.

DEREK

That was out of line.

GEORGE

Good to see you, Derek.

MIRTHA

Now let's fucking party, motherfuckers!

Let's have some fucking fun.

DEREK

Jesus, is that Mirtha!?

DEREK (CONT'D)

Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a

cheeseburger or something.  What does

she weight, eighty pounds?

GEORGE

I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's

going to blow an O-ring.

MIRTHA

Happy birthday, baby.  Do a line.

GEORGE

No, that's alright.

MIRTHA

Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down

for once.  It's your fucking birthday,

for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking

pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this

big time drug dealer and wound up with

the maid.

GEORGE

No honey, I'm alright.

AUGUSTO

A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I

95, north and south.  My brother-in-law.

Happy birthday!

EVERYONE

To George!

PARTY GUEST

Cops!  They're all over the place.

BARTENDER

Freeze!

WAITER

Massachusetts State Police Department!

Everybody on the floor!

GEORGE

What's this?

DETECTIVE #2

It's your statement.  How it was all

yours, the pound of coke was for

personal use and none of the guests had

any idea it was there, yeah, right.

GEORGE

I want my kid out of protective custody.

Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my

kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when

they call me safe and sound.

DETECTIVE #1

No fucking way.

GEORGE

Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.

DETECTIVE #2

Do it.

DETECTIVE #1

George?  You better get yourself a good

lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your

ass to the wall on this one.

GEORGE

Oh hey, one more thing?

DETECTIVE #1

What's that?

GEORGE

Get me a six pack.

GEORGE

Fuck.

GEORGE

Hi.

FRED

I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.

ERMINE (O.S.)

Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell

him he's not welcome here.

GEORGE

Mom.

ERMINE

Don't you dare step one foot in this

house.  You're not my son, you hear me?

I don't have a son anymore.

FRED

She's angry.  It's all over the news.

GEORGE

Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going

away for awhile.

FRED

You're not going to trial?

GEORGE

No.

FRED

Good.

GEORGE

Give this to Mom, will you?

FRED

Money.  You and your mother.  All the

time chasing it.  I never understood it.

GEORGE

Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her

happy.

FRED

Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?

GEORGE

Tell Mom, you know...

FRED

I'll tell her.

FRED (CONT'D)

Take care of yourself.

GEORGE

I'd like to make a withdrawal.

BANK EMPLOYEE

Excuse me, please.

BANK PRESIDENT

I'm afraid there is a problem, Mr. Jung.

The banks have gone through a change, a

nationalization.  I'm afraid your funds

have been appropriated by the Panamanian

Government...

MIRTHA

What are we going to do?!  What are we

going to use for money?!

GEORGE

Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for

Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight.

I'll do something.

MIRTHA

Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer

the question.  What do I spend?  What?

How will we live?

GEORGE

Not in front of the kid.

MIRTHA

Don't give me that shit.  You just

better do something.

GEORGE

Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

Don't be upset.

KRISTINA

What's happening to us?

GEORGE

I don't know.

KRISTINA

Are we gonna split up?

GEORGE

No, never.  Don't even think about that,

it's impossible.  I love your mother.

And you are my heart.  Could I live

without my heart?  Could I?

GEORGE

There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha.

Be cool, will ya.

MIRTHA

Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.

GEORGE

Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing

cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your

fucking problem?

MIRTHA

My problem?  We're broke, that's my

fucking problem.  And you're a fucking

spy.

GEORGE

What?

MIRTHA

That's right.  Always spying, always

judging.  Everyone's laughing at you,

you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck

you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking

faggot.  You must be fucking Diego

because you're not fucking me.

GEORGE

Those are my nuts!

MIRTHA

He's a fugitive and a fucking cocaine

dealer!  There's a kilo in his trunk

right now!  Take this sorry motherfucker

to jail!

MIRTHA

I'm divorcing you, George.  I'm getting

custody of Kristina.  And when you get

out next week, you're going to pay

support and that's the end of it.

Alright?  There's someone else.  I'm

sorry.

MIRTHA (CONT'D)

You should have taken better care of me,

you know?  You've been away a long time.

Four years.  Say something.

GEORGE

What do you want me to say?  I'm in

prison.  You should know.  You put me

here.

MIRTHA

Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say

something like that.  Always thinking

about yourself.

GEORGE

My baby.  She's so big.

KRISTINA

I thought you couldn't live without your

heart.

GEORGE

Hello, Derek?  It's George.  Yeah.

Yeah, I am.  I'm in Miami.  I'm looking

to do something.  I want to put together

a crew.  Do you know anybody?  Leon?  I

don't know him.  What's his last name?

Alright.  Give me the number.

KRISTINA

What are you doing here?

GEORGE

Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I

was out.  I just wanted to see you.

KRISTINA

Well, here I am.  See?

GEORGE

How are you doing?

KRISTINA

George, you just can't show up, tell me

you love me, and have everything be

okay.

GEORGE

Dad.

KRISTINA

What?

GEORGE

You can call me Dad if you want.

KRISTINA

I don't want, alright?  It's not funny.

I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew

it, now leave me alone.

GEORGE

Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going

to make this right.  I've got a few

things going on...

KRISTINA

What do you want from me?

GEORGE

Just to walk with you.  I want to be

your dad again.

KRISTINA

Do what you want, it's a free country.

LEON

It's a four-man operation.  Two on the

ground.  Two in the air.

GEORGE

Who's the co-pilot?

LEON

You're looking at him.  We provide the

plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing

spot, and take it to wherever you want

it to go.  You provide the pick up point

in South America, and are responsible

for payment.  You assume all the bust

risks.  We take sixty-five percent of

all transportation fees, ten percent of

the gross, plus our expenses.

This is not a negotiation, so if this is

okay with you, we can talk further.  If

not, we can forget we had this

conversation.

GEORGE

Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet

everybody.

LEON

They're over at the booth.

LEON (CONT'D)

Gentlemen, this is George.  George, this

is Ben, G.G. and...

GEORGE

Holy shit, Dulli!

KEVIN

Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!

GEORGE (V.O.)

That was it.  Seeing Dulli after

fourteen years sealed the deal for me.

The rest was just details.  My end was

roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina

and I could have a good life for five

hundred grand.  Start over somewhere.

One final score.  That's all I needed.

AUGUSTO

Three-hundred kilos is a very big load,

Georgie.  Why don't we start small?

GEORGE

No.  I have the space.  I figured it

out.  This is what I want to do.

AUGUSTO

Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's

for you.  I don't think there will be a

problem.

GEORGE

Five-thousand per kilo.

AUGUSTO

Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those

days are over.  The rate is one-thousand

dollars.  Inflation, you know?

GEORGE

This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One

and I'm out.  Give me a good price for

old time's sake.  What do you think?

GEORGE

Let me ask you something.  If you could

go anywhere in the world, anywhere,

where would you want to go?

KRISTINA

You mean, like a trip?

GEORGE

Yeah, sure, whatever.

KRISTINA

I don't know.  Maybe California.

GEORGE

California?  You can go anywhere in the

world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia.

Paris.  And you choose California?

KRISTINA

Yeah.

GEORGE

What is it?  A Disneyland thing?

KRISTINA

No.  I just kind of like the sound of

it.

GEORGE

California, huh?

KRISTINA

California.

GEORGE

Go on inside now.  I want to talk to

your mom alone.

KRISTINA

Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?

GEORGE

I'll be here.

MIRTHA

What do you want?

GEORGE

You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?

MIRTHA

Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to

school.

GEORGE

Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love

her, y'know?  I kind of want to have

her.  I've been away for so long.  Make

up for the missed time, you know?

MIRTHA

I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You

haven't paid me one cent in child

support, alimony.

GEORGE

Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've

got something going.

MIRTHA

Yeah?  I better see some money out of

it.

GEORGE

Yeah, you will.  Of course.

MIRTHA

Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows

what will happen.  You're a good father,

George.  I always gave you that.  But

you've got to talk to her.

GEORGE

Yeah.

MIRTHA

She's getting big.  Getting her own

ideas.

GEORGE

I know.  Well, that's all I really

wanted to say.  So, okay, then.

MIRTHA

Hey, George.  You okay?

GEORGE

Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.

KEVIN

We take off from Lauderdale, Sunday,

refuel, and be in Medellin by Monday.

LEON

Overnight, refuel, and back Wednesday

night.

GEORGE

Where are you coming in?

BEN

Vero Beach.

G.G.

It's good.  It's small.

LEON

Then we drive it to the Lauderdale house

where it stays until pick up and payment

the next morning.  You want to go over

it again?

GEORGE

No.  All set.  Piece of cake.

GEORGE

I'm thinking about getting out of town

this week.  You want to come with me?

KRISTINA

Where are you going?

GEORGE

I don't know.  Maybe California.

KRISTINA

You swear?

GEORGE

Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see

what it's like.  I've got some stuff to

do this week, but I'm thinking maybe

Thursday.  Thursday after school.

KRISTINA

You know I can't.  Mom will never let me

go.

GEORGE

You let me take care of your mother.

You just pack your bags.

KRISTINA

But I've got school.

GEORGE

There's schools in California.

KRISTINA

You swear?

GEORGE

That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday.

At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a

date.

KRISTINA

I don't believe you.

GEORGE

I swear.  On my life.

KRISTINA

Swear on my life.

GEORGE

I swear on your life.

KEVIN

Are we good?

GEORGE

Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're

beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A

grade, one-hundred percent pure

Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen.

Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow.

Good riddance.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never

fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone

just got a raise.  Instead of ten

percent, you get fifteen.

LEON

Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's

an extra two-hundred large.

GEORGE

I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have

a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out.

Starting over.  Cheers.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Yeah!  Unbelievable.  Dulli, pour us

another round.  I gotta hit the head.

LEON

What?

G.G.

I feel bad.

BEN

Me too.  He's not such a bad guy.

KEVIN

Fuck you guys.  All of you.  I've known

him for thirty fucking years.  Fucking

George.

LEON

Yeah, I like him, too.  But what's done

is done.  So let's not get all

sentimental about it, okay?

GEORGE

(laughing)

Dulli, I was just thinking about that

time we landed in Mexico.  You've gotten

a lot better since then, huh pal?

Remember that fucking landing strip?

Huh?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Hey, what's wrong fellas?  Why the long

faces?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

(defeated)

No.  C'mon, Dulli.

GEORGE

Oh, no.

GEORGE (V.O.)

I was busted.  Set up by the FBI and the

DEA.  That didn't bother me.  Set up by

Kevin Dulli and Derek Foreal to save

their own asses.  That didn't bother me.

Sentenced to sixty years at Otisville.

That didn't bother me.

GEORGE (V.O.)

I had broken a promise.  Everything I

loved in my life goes away.

ZIGMOND

Here's the deal, George.  You're not

getting out.  I tried to get you

furloughed, but your mother squashed it.

Said it would only upset him.  I'm

sorry.

GEORGE

How's he doing?

ZIGMOND

Well, he's out of the hospital, but

there's not much anyone can do for him.

It's just a matter of time.  Listen, I

brought a tape recorder in case you

wanted to say something to him.  That

way he could hear your voice.

GEORGE

Right.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Hello, Dad...

GEORGE (V.O.)

You know, I remember a lifetime ago, I

was about three-and-a-half feet tall,

weighing all of sixty-pounds, every inch

your son...

GEORGE (V.O.)

...those Saturday mornings going to work

with my Dad.  We'd climb into that big

yellow truck.  I used to think it was

the biggest truck in the world.

GEORGE (V.O.)

I remember how important the job we did

was.

How if it weren't for us, people would

freeze to death.  I thought you were the

strongest man in the world.

GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Remember those home movies when Mom

would dress up like Loretta Young?  And

the ice creams and the football games?

Waino, the Tuna, and the day I left for

California only to come home with the

FBI chasing me?

GEORGE (V.O.)

And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had

to get on his knees to put my boots on?

You said...

FRED

That's where you belong...

FRED

...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's

boots.

GEORGE (V.O.)

That was a good one, Dad.  That was

really something.  Remember that?

GEORGE (V.O.)

And that time you told me that money

wasn't real?  Well, old man, I'm forty

two years old.  I finally learned what

you tried to tell me so many years ago.

GEORGE (V.O.)

I finally understand.  You're the best,

Dad.  I just wish I could have done more

for you.  I wish we had more time.

GEORGE

I guess I kind of lost sight of things.

"May the wind always be at your back and

the sun always upon your face, and the

winds of destiny carry you aloft to

dance with the stars."  Love, George.

FRED

That was a beautiful message.

GEORGE

I meant every word of it.

FRED

Did you know I died two weeks after you

sent me that tape?

GEORGE

Yeah, Dad.  I knew that.

GARCIA

How are you doing, George?

GEORGE

What do you guys want?

GARCIA

You hear about your old friend, Diego?

GEORGE

What about him?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?

GARCIA

He's going down, George.  It's election

year.  We're not making any deals.

FBI GUY #1

He's never getting out.  Orders from the

top.

GARCIA

So, how would you like to help us put

him away?

FBI GUY #2

We've done our homework.  We know you

hate this motherfucker.

GEORGE

I don't think so.

GARCIA

Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him.

We've got him dead to rights.  But like

I said, this is top priority so we're

handing out free passes on this one.

And the first one's got your name on it.

Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.

GEORGE

No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong

fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.

GEORGE

Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything

okay with Kristina?

MIRTHA

Kristina's fine.

GEORGE

Is she here?  Is she coming?

MIRTHA

Is she here?  George, Kristina hates

you.  You fucked her over one too many

times.  And I'm not here to socialize.

Did you hear about Diego?

GEORGE

Yeah.

MIRTHA

Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said

this thing with Diego is a disaster.

He's giving up lab locations, names,

bank accounts, he was very pissed off.

Pablo said to take him down.  His exact

words were "Fuck Diego."

GEORGE

He wants me to testify?  Is that what

he's asking me to do?

MIRTHA

George, he wasn't asking.

GEORGE

Mirtha, how are you doing?

MIRTHA

Better than you.

GEORGE

Hey, Arch, you think the judge will let

us get a cocktail after this is all

over?

ZIGMOND

I'll see what I can do, George.

GEORGE

Thanks, Arch.

CLERK

Sir, please state your name.

GEORGE

I'm George Jung.  Spelled J-U-N-G.

CLERK

Thank you.

PROSECUTOR

Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?

GEORGE

Yes, I do.

PROSECUTOR

Do you see him here in the courtroom?

GEORGE

Yes, he's sitting right there at the end

of the table.

PROSECUTOR

Let the record state the witness has

identified, Diego Delgado.

PROSECUTOR (CONT'D)

Mr. Jung, can you describe the

circumstances of how you began talking

about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?

GEORGE

Shortly after I arrived at Danbury

Federal Correctional Institute I related

to Diego that the crime I was in for was

smuggling marijuana.

Diego told me he had high level

connections in Colombia and they needed

to find someone to help them transport

cocaine into America...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

The first run was fifteen kilos, which

we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard

shelled suitcases.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen

cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way

if there were any dogs in customs...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack

Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of

cocaine per week into the United States

via twin-engine Cessnas.  Jack would fly

into North Carolina, we'd meet him there

and drive it down to different

distribution points...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I never met Pablo Escobar.  Diego

Delgado was my only connection to

cocaine from Colombia...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Diego convinced me to keep most of my

money in a Panamanian bank.  Diego had a

close relationship with Manuel Noriega.

In exchange for allowing us to keep our

money there, we paid him a percentage.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

There was an 85% chance that if you

snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it

was ours. Initially with my LA

connections, we invented the

marketplace.  In 1977, there was no

other real competition.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

The first year we made about 100 million

dollars between us.  It was an expensive

operation.  Eventually we built up to

three different pilots doing multiple

runs per week, connections on both

coasts, everything was running smooth.

We were like a corporation...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

he was very anti-government.  He talked

about revolution, forming his own

country or island, he was looking for

power as well as money.  I was just

looking for money.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

He disliked the United States, thought

it was a police state.  He hoped that by

flooding the country with cocaine, it

would disrupt the political system and

tear down the morality of the country.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my

connection, I met him back in 1968 when

I first moved to Manhattan Beach.  It

was Foreal's marijuana connections that

kicked off our cocaine market.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos

to Los Angeles.  When Diego finally got

Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only

a matter of months before he'd cut me

out.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I'm not sure how my relationship with my

daughter and ex-wife have anything to do

with this trial.  I mean we're here to

talk about Diego Delgado, aren't we?

CALIBANOS

Yes, we are Mr. Jung.

CALIBANOS (CONT'D)

Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon,

correct?

GEORGE

Yes, I am.

CALIBANOS

Do you have any agreement or

understanding whatsoever with the United

States government in regards to your

testimony?

GEORGE

No, I cam here out of my own volition.

CALIBANOS

Excuse me?

GEORGE

Something about vengance being best

served cold.

CALIBANOS

Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?

GEORGE

Excuse me?

CALIBANOS

Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or

understanding with the United States

Government in connection with your

testimony in this case?

GEORGE

I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no

chance of parole.  Even if they cut my

sentence in half I'll be seventy-three

years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I

don't know if the parole board, the

judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself

can get me out of here.  I have a really

bad record, I'm not sure what's going to

happen.

CALIBANOS

So you do have an agreement with the

United States Government, Mr. Jung,

correct?

CALIBANOS (CONT'D)

I thought so.  No more questions.

GEORGE

You shouldn't have taken the 30 million,

Diego, I was out.

CLERK

The court calls Mr. Jack Stevens.

KRISTINA

I'm here to see my father.

ADMISSIONS OFFICER

GUARD

Hey, George, five more minutes, buddy.

ADMISSIONS OFFICER

ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D)

Belongings in here.

ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D)

Feet on the blue line.

ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D)

Miss?

ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D)

Miss?  Something wrong?

GUARD

George?  George, come on.  You've got a

visitor.

GEORGE

I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.

KRISTINA

It's alright, Dad.

GEORGE

I didn't mean to...

KRISTINA

I know, Dad.  I know...

GEORGE

I fucked up.

KRISTINA

Shhhh.

GEORGE

I love you.  I love you so much.  You've

got to know that.  You've got to know.

KRISTINA

I know, Dad.  I love you too.

GEORGE

After everything.  After everything, the

only thing left out of my whole life is

you.

GUARD

George?  George, come on.  It's getting

dark.

GEORGE

But I have a visitor.

GUS

Not today, George.  Time to go back.

GEORGE

But I want to put her name on the list

for tomorrow.  My daughter.

GUS

Okay, George.

GEORGE

Because she's visiting me.

GUS

We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's

lockdown time.
