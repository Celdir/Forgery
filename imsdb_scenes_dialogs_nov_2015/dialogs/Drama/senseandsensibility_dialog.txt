"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY"

Screenplay by

Emma Thompson

Based on the novel by

Jane Austen

MR DASHWOOD

(urgent)

Is John not yet arrived?

MRS DASHWOOD

We expect him at any moment, dearest.

MR DASHWOOD

The girls--I have left so little.

MRS DASHWOOD

Shh, hush, Henry.

MR DASHWOOD

Elinor will try to look after you

all, but make sure she finds a good

husband. The men are such noodles

hereabouts, little wonder none has

pleased her.

MRS DASHWOOD

But Marianne is sure to find her

storybook hero.

MR DASHWOOD

A romantic poet with flashing eyes

and empty pockets?

MRS DASHWOOD

As long as she loves him, whoever he

is.

MR DASHWOOD

Margaret will go to sea and become a

pirate so we need not concern

ourselves with her.

THOMAS

Your son is arrived from London,

sir.

MR DASHWOOD

Let me speak to John alone.

MR DASHWOOD

Ah, my dear. How happy you have made

me.

JOHN

Father...

MR DASHWOOD

John you will find out soon enough

from my will that the estate of

Norland was left to me in such a way

as prevents me from dividing it

between my families.

JOHN

Calm yourself, Father. This is not

good for you.

MR DASHWOOD

Norland in its entirety is therefore

yours by law and I am happy for you

and Fanny.

MR DASHWOOD

But your stepmother my wife and

daughters are left with only five

hundred pounds a year, barely enough

to live on and nothing for the girls'

dowries. You must help them.

JOHN

Of course

MR DASHWOOD

You must promise to do this.

JOHN

I promise, Father, I promise.

JOHN

Come! Come quickly!

MR DASHWOOD

Help them.

FANNY (V.O.)

'Help them?'

FANNY

What do you mean, 'help them'?

JOHN

Dearest, I mean to give them three

thousand pounds.

JOHN

The interest will provide them with

a little extra income. Such a gift

will certainly discharge my promise

to my father.

FANNY

Oh, without question! More than

amply...

JOHN

One had rather, on such occasions,

do too much than too little.

JOHN

Of course, he did not stipulate a

particular sum.

MRS DASHWOOD

To be reduced to the condition of

visitor in my own home! It is not to

be borne, Elinor!

ELINOR

Consider, Mamma! We have nowhere to

go.

MRS DASHWOOD

John and Fanny will descend from

London at any moment, followed no

doubt by cartloads of relatives ready

to turn us out of our rooms one by

one do you expect me to be here to

welcome them? Vultures!

ELINOR

I shall start making inquiries for a

new house at once. Until then we

must try to bear their coming.

JOHN

Fifteen hundred then. What say you

to fifteen hundred?

FANNY

What brother on earth would do half

so much for his real sisters--let

alone half-blood?

JOHN

They can hardly expect more.

FANNY

There is no knowing what they expect.

The question is, what can you afford?

ELINOR

Marianne, cannot you play something

else? Mamma has been weeping since

breakfast.

ELINOR

I meant something less mournful,

dearest.

JOHN

A hundred pounds a year to their

mother while she lives. Would that

be more advisable? It is better than

parting with the fifteen hundred all

at once.

FANNY

But if she should live longer than

fifteen years we would be completely

taken in. People always live forever

when there is an annuity to be paid

them.

ELINOR

Margaret, are you there? Please come

down. John and Fanny will be here

soon.

MARGARET (V.O.)

Why are they coming to live at

Norland? They already have a house

in London.

ELINOR

Because houses go from father to

son, dearest not from father to

daughter. It is the law.

ELINOR

If you come inside, we could play

with your atlas.

MARGARET (V.O.)

It's not my atlas any more. It's

their atlas.

JOHN

Twenty pounds now and then will amply

discharge my promise, you are quite

right.

FANNY

Indeed. Although to say the truth, I

am convinced within myself that your

father had no idea of your giving

them money.

JOHN

They will have five hundred a year

amongst them as it is--

FANNY

--and what on earth can four women

want for more than that? Their

housekeeping will be nothing at all

they will have no carriage, no horses,

hardly any servants and will keep no

company. Only conceive how comfortable

they will be!

ELINOR

As you know, we are looking for a

new home. When we leave we shall be

able to retain only Thomas and Betsy.

ELINOR

We are very sorry to have to leave

you all. But we are certain you will

find the new Mrs Dashwood a fair and

generous mistress.

FANNY (V.O.)

They will be much more able to give

you something.

JOHN

So we are agreed. No money but the

occasional gift of game and fish in

season will be very welcome.

FANNY

Your father would be proud of you.

ELINOR

How is Mrs Ferrars?

FANNY

My mother is always in excellent

health, thank you. My brother Robert

is in town with her this season and

quite the most popular bachelor in

London! He has his own barouche.

ELINOR

You have two brothers, have you not?

FANNY

Indeed, yes. Edward is the eldest

Mamma quite depends upon him. He is

traveling up from Plymouth shortly

and will break his journey here.

JOHN

(to MRS DASHWOOD)

If that is agreeable to you, of

course.

MRS DASHWOOD

My dear John this is your home now.

MARIANNE

Fanny wishes to know where the key

for the silver cabinet is kept.

ELINOR

Betsy has it, I think. What does

Fanny want with the silver?

MARIANNE

I can only presume she wants to count

it. What are you doing?

ELINOR

Presents for the servants. Have you

seen Margaret? I am worried about

her. She has taken to hiding in the

oddest places.

MARIANNE

Fortunate girl. At least she can

escape Fanny, which is more than any

of us is able.

ELINOR

You do your best. You have not said

a word to her for a week.

MARIANNE

(truculently)

I have! I have said 'yes' and 'no'.

MARIANNE

(very polite)

Good morning, Fanny.

FANNY

Good morning, Marianne.

MARIANNE

(to Fanny)

How did you find the silver? Is it

all genuine?

ELINOR

Pray, when may we expect the pleasure

of your brother's company?

FANNY

Edward is due tomorrow. And my dear

Mrs Dashwood, in view of the fact

that he will not be with us for long,

I wondered if Miss Margaret would

mind giving up her room to him the

view is quite incomparable from her

windows and I should so much like

Edward to see Norland at its best.

MARIANNE

Intolerable woman!

ELINOR

There is but one consolation if Edward

is anything like Fanny, we shall be

only too happy to leave.

FANNY

But where is Miss Margaret? I declare,

Mrs Dashwood, I am beginning to doubt

of her existence! She must run

positively wild!

MRS DASHWOOD

Forgive us, Mr Ferrars. My youngest

is not to be found this morning. She

is a little shy of strangers at

present.

EDWARD

Naturally. I am also shy of strangers

and I have nothing like her excuse.

MARIANNE

(dangerous)

How do you like your view, Mr Ferrars?

EDWARD

Very much. Your stables are very

handsome and beautifully kept, Mrs

Dashwood.

FANNY

Stables! Edward--your windows overlook

the lake.

EDWARD

An oversight, Fanny, led me to the

wrong room. I have rectified the

situation and am happily settled in

the guest quarters.

FANNY

They are all exceedingly spoilt, I

find. Miss Margaret spends all her

time up trees and under furniture

and I have barely had a civil word

from Marianne.

EDWARD

My dear Fanny, they have just lost

their father their lives will never

be the same again.

FANNY

That is no excuse.

FANNY

I have never liked the smell of books.

EDWARD

Oh? No. The dust, perhaps.

EDWARD

I hear you have great plans for the

walnut grove.

FANNY

Oh yes! I shall have it pulled down

to make room for a Grecian temple.

EDWARD

How picturesque. Will you show me

the site?

ELINOR

Too expensive. We do not need four

bedrooms, we can share.

MARIANNE

This one, then?

ELINOR

Marianne, we have only five hundred

pounds a year. I will send out more

inquiries today.

EDWARD

Pardon my intrusion, but I believe I

have found what you are looking for.

ELINOR (V.O.)

Won't you come out, dearest? We

haven't seen you all day. Mamma is

very concerned.

EDWARD

Oh, Miss Dashwood! Excuse me I was

wondering do you by any chance have

such a thing as a reliable atlas?

ELINOR

I believe so.

EDWARD

Excellent. I wish to check the

position of the Nile.

EDWARD

My sister says it is in South America.

ELINOR

Oh! No, no indeed. She is quite wrong.

For I believe it is in--in Belgium.

EDWARD

Belgium? Surely not. You must be

thinking of the Volga.

MARGARET

(from under the table)

The Volga?

ELINOR

Of course. The Volga, which, as you

know, starts in...

EDWARD

Vladivostok, and ends in...

ELINOR

St Albans.

EDWARD

Indeed. Where the coffee beans come

from.

MARGARET

The source of the Nile is in

Abyssinia.

EDWARD

Is it? Good heavens. How do you do.

Edward Ferrars.

MARGARET

Margaret Dashwood.

ELINOR

(apologetic)

That was my father's favourite.

ELINOR

Thank you so much for your help with

Margaret, Mr Ferrars. She is a changed

girl since your arrival.

EDWARD

Not at all. I enjoy her company.

ELINOR

Has she shown you her tree-house?

EDWARD

Not yet. Would you do me the honour,

Miss Dashwood? It is very fine out.

ELINOR

With pleasure.

ELINOR

Margaret has always wanted to travel.

EDWARD

I know. She is heading an expedition

to China shortly. I am to go as her

servant but only on the understanding

that I will be very badly treated.

ELINOR

What will your duties be?

EDWARD

Sword-fighting, administering rum

and swabbing.

ELINOR

Ah.

EDWARD

All I want--all I have ever wanted

is the quiet of a private life but

my mother is determined to see me

distinguished.

ELINOR

As?

EDWARD

She hardly knows. Any fine figure

will suit a great orator, a leading

politician, even a barrister would

serve, but only on the condition

that I drive my own barouche and

dine in the first circles.

ELINOR

And what do you wish for?

EDWARD

I always preferred the church, but

that is not smart enough for my mother

she prefers the army, but that is a

great deal too smart for me.

ELINOR

Would you stay in London?

EDWARD

I hate London. No peace. A country

living is my ideal a small parish

where I might do some good, keep

chickens and give very short sermons.

ELINOR

You talk of feeling idle and useless

imagine how that is compounded when

one has no choice and no hope

whatsoever of any occupation.

EDWARD

Our circumstances are therefore

precisely the same.

ELINOR

Except that you will inherit your

fortune.

ELINOR

We cannot even earn ours.

EDWARD

Perhaps Margaret is right.

ELINOR

Right?

EDWARD

Piracy is our only option.

EDWARD

What is swabbing exactly?

EDWARD

No voice divine the storm allayed No

light propitious shone, When snatched

from all effectual aid, We perished

each alone: But I beneath a rougher

sea, And whelmed in deeper gulfs

than he.

MARIANNE

No, Edward! Listen.

MARIANNE

Can you not feel his despair? Try

again.

MARIANNE

Mamma, look. This has just arrived.

MRS DASHWOOD

(reading from the

letter)

'I should be pleased to offer you a

home at Barton Cottage as soon as

ever you have need of it' why, it is

from my cousin, Sir John Middleton!

MARIANNE

Even Elinor must approve the rent.

MRS DASHWOOD

Has Elinor not yet seen this?

MARIANNE

No I will fetch her.

MRS DASHWOOD

Wait. No. Let us delay.

MARIANNE

Why?

MRS DASHWOOD

I think--I believe that Edward and

Elinor have formed an attachment.

MRS DASHWOOD

It would be cruel to take her away

so soon and Devonshire is so far.

MRS DASHWOOD

Why so grave? Do you disapprove her

choice?

MARIANNE

By no means. Edward is very amiable.

MRS DASHWOOD

Amiable but?

MARIANNE

But there is something wanting. He

is too sedate his reading last night.

MRS DASHWOOD

Elinor has not your feelings, his

reserve suits her.

MARIANNE

Can he love her? Can the ardour of

the soul really be satisfied with

such polite, concealed affections?

To love is to burn to be on fire,

all made of passion, of adoration,

of sacrifice! Like Juliet, or

Guinevere or Heloise.

MRS DASHWOOD

They made rather pathetic ends, dear.

MARIANNE

Pathetic! To die for love? How can

you say so? What could be more

glorious?

MRS DASHWOOD

I think that may be taking your

romantic sensibilities a little far.

MARIANNE

The more I know of the world, the

more I am convinced that I shall

never see a man whom I can truly

love.

MRS DASHWOOD

You require so much!

MARIANNE

I do not! I require only what any

young woman of taste should a man

who sings well, dances admirably,

rides bravely, reads with passion

and whose tastes agree in every point

with my own.

MARIANNE

Is love a fancy, or a feeling? No It

is immortal as immaculate truth 'Tis

not a blossom shed as soon as Youth

Drops from the stem of life for it

will grow In barren regions, where

no waters flow Nor ray of promise

cheats the pensive gloom--

MARIANNE

What a pity it is that Edward has no

passion for reading.

ELINOR

It was you who asked him to read and

then you made him nervous.

MARIANNE

Me?

ELINOR

But your behaviour to him in all

other respects is perfectly cordial

so I must assume that you like him

in spite of his deficiencies.

MARIANNE

(trying hard)

I think him everything that is amiable

and worthy.

ELINOR

Praise indeed!

MARIANNE

But he shall have my unanswering

devotion when you tell me he is to

be my brother.

MARIANNE

How shall I do without you?

ELINOR

Do without me?

MARIANNE

I am sure you will be very happy.

But you must promise not to live too

far away.

ELINOR

Marianne, there is no question of

that is, there is no under standing

between...

MARIANNE

Do you love him?

ELINOR

I do not attempt to deny that I think

very highly of him that I greatly

esteem that I like him.

MARIANNE

Esteem him! Like him! Use those

insipid words again and I shall leave

the room this instant!

ELINOR

Very well. Forgive me. Believe my

feelings to be stronger than I have

declared but further than that you

must not believe.

MARIANNE

'Is love a fancy or a feeling?' Or a

Ferrars?

ELINOR

Go to bed!

MARIANNE

(imitating Elinor)

'I do not attempt to deny that I

think highly of him greatly esteem

him! Like him!'

MRS DASHWOOD

We are all so happy that you chose

to invite Edward to Norland. He is a

dear boy and we are all very fond of

him.

FANNY

We have great hopes for him. Much is

expected of him by our mother with

regard to his profession

MRS DASHWOOD

Naturally.

FANNY

And in marriage. She is determined

that both he and Robert will marry

well.

MRS DASHWOOD

Of course. But I hope she desires

them to marry for love, first and

foremost? I have always felt that,

contrary to common wisdom, true

affection is by far the most valuable

dowry.

FANNY

Love is all very well, but

unfortunately we cannot always rely

on the heart to lead us in the most

suitable directions.

FANNY

You see, my dear Mrs Dashwood, Edward

is entirely the kind of compassionate

person upon whom penniless women can

prey--and having entered into any

kind of understanding, he would never

go back on his word. He is quite

simply incapable of doing so. But it

would lead to his ruin. I worry for

him so, Mrs Dashwood. My mother has

always made it perfectly plain that

she will withdraw all financial

support from Edward, should he choose

to plant his affections in less...

exalted ground than he deserves.

MRS DASHWOOD

I understand you perfectly.

EDWARD

Devonshire!

MRS DASHWOOD

My cousin Sir John Middleton has

offered us a small house on his

estate.

JOHN

Sir John Middleton? What is his

situation? He must be a man of

property.

MRS DASHWOOD

He is a widower. He lives with his

mother-in-law at Barton Park and it

is Barton Cottage that he offers us.

FANNY

Oh, a cottage! How charming. A little

cottage is always very snug.

EDWARD

But you will not leave before the

summer?

MRS DASHWOOD

Oh, my dear Edward, we can no longer

trespass upon your sister's good

will. We must leave as soon as

possible.

MARGARET

You will come and stay with us,

Edward!

EDWARD

I should like that very much.

FANNY

Edward has long been expected in

town by our mother.

MRS DASHWOOD

Come as soon as you can, Edward.

Remember that you are always welcome.

EDWARD

Cannot you take him with you?

ELINOR

We cannot possibly afford him.

EDWARD

Perhaps he could make himself useful

in the kitchen?

EDWARD

Miss Dashwood--Elinor. I must talk

to you.

EDWARD

There is something of great importance

I need... to tell you--

EDWARD

--about--about my education.

ELINOR

(after a beat)

Your education?

EDWARD

Yes. It was less... successful than

it might have been.

EDWARD

It was conducted in Plymouth--oddly

enough.

ELINOR

Indeed?

EDWARD

Yes. Do you know it?

ELINOR

Plymouth?

EDWARD

Yes.

ELINOR

No.

EDWARD

Oh--well--I spent four years there--

at a school run by a--a Mr Pratt--

ELINOR

Pratt?

EDWARD

Precisely--Mr Pratt--and there, I--

that is to say, he has a--

FANNY

Edward! Edward!

FANNY

I have been all over for you! You

are needed in London this instant!

EDWARD

Fanny, I am leaving this afternoon

as it is--

FANNY

No, no, that will not do. Family

affairs are in chaos owing to your

absence. Mother is quite adamant

that you should leave at once.

EDWARD

Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.

MARGARET

Edward promised he would bring the

atlas to Barton for me.

MARIANNE

Did he? Well, I will wager he will

do so in less than a fortnight!

MARGARET (V.O.)

Are we there yet?

MRS DASHWOOD

Sir John!

SIR JOHN

Dear ladies, dear ladies, upon my

word, here you are, here you are,

here you are!

MRS DASHWOOD

Sir John, your extraordinary kindness--

SIR JOHN

Oh, none of that, hush, please, none

of that, but here is my dear mamma-

in-law Mrs Jennings.

MRS JENNINGS

Was the journey tolerable, you poor

souls?

SIR JOHN

Why did you not come up to the Park

first and take your ease? We saw you

pass--Like many people who live rather

lonely lives together.

MRS JENNINGS

--but I would not wait for you to

come to us, I made John call for the

carriage--

SIR JOHN

She would not wait, you know.

MRS JENNINGS

--as we get so little company.

MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)

But I feel as if I know you already--

delightful creatures!

SIR JOHN (V.O.)

Delightful! And you know you are to

dine at Barton Park every day.

MRS DASHWOOD (V.O.)

Oh, but dear Sir John, we cannot--

SIR JOHN (V.O.)

Oh, no no no no no no no, I shall

not brook refusals. I am quite deaf

to 'em, you know--

MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)

--deaf--

SIR JOHN (V.O.)

But I insist!

ELINOR (V.O.)

Let us only settle in for a few days,

Sir John, and thank you--

SIR JOHN (V.O.)

Oh, no thankings, no, please, can't

bear 'em, embarrassing, you know--

SIR JOHN (V.O.)

We will send game and fruit as a

matter of course--

MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)

--fruit and game--

SIR JOHN (V.O.)

--and the carriage is at your beck

and call--

MRS JENNINGS

--call--and here is Miss Marianne!

SIR JOHN

Where did you disappear to?

MRS JENNINGS

I declare you are the loveliest girl

I ever set eyes on! Cannot you get

them married, Mrs Dashwood? You must

not leave it too long!

SIR JOHN

But, alas, there are no smart young

men hereabouts to woo them--

MRS JENNINGS

--not a beau for miles!

SIR JOHN

Come, Mother, let us leave them in

peace.

MRS JENNINGS

But there is Colonel Brandon!

SIR JOHN

Excellent fellow! We served in the

East India Regiment together.

MRS JENNINGS

Just wait till he sees you! If we

can persuade him out to meet you!

SIR JOHN

Reclusive individual. But you are

fatigued. I can see that you are

fatigued.

MRS JENNINGS

Of course she is fatigued!

SIR JOHN

Come along, Mother, we really must

leave them to themselves.

MRS JENNINGS

You must get your maidservant to

make you up some camphor--it is the

best tonic for the staggers!

SIR JOHN

Send Thomas to us for the carriage

when you are ready!

MARGARET

I like them.

MRS DASHWOOD

(weakly)

What generosity.

ELINOR

Indeed. I am surprised they did not

offer us their clothing.

BETSY

Sugar is five shilling a pound these

parts, Miss Dashwood.

ELINOR

(lightly)

No more sugar then.

MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)

Not a beau for miles.

SIR JOHN (V.O.)

Where can Brandon be, poor fellow? I

hope he has not lamed his horse.

MRS JENNINGS

Colonel Brandon is the most eligible

bachelor in the county--he is bound

to do for one of you. Mind, he is a

better age for Miss Dashwood--but I

dare say she left her heart behind

in Sussex, eh?

MRS JENNINGS

Aha! I see you, Miss Marianne! I

think I have unearthed a secret!

SIR JOHN

Oho! Have you sniffed one out already,

Mother? You are worse than my best

pointer, Flossie!

MRS JENNINGS

What sort of man is he, Miss Dashwood?

Is he butcher, baker, candlestick-

maker? I shall winkle it out of you

somehow, you know!

SIR JOHN

She's horribly good at winkling.

MRS JENNINGS

You are in lonely country now, Miss

Dashwood, none of us has any secrets

here--

SIR JOHN

--or if we do, we do not keep them

for long!

MRS JENNINGS

He is curate of the parish, I dare

say!

SIR JOHN

Or a handsome lieutenant!

MRS JENNINGS

Give us a clue, Miss Dashwood--is he

in uniform?

MARGARET

He has no profession!

SIR JOHN

No profession! A gentleman, then!

MARIANNE

(with daggers)

Margaret, you know perfectly well

there is no such person.

MARGARET

There is! There is! And his name

begins with an F!

MRS DASHWOOD

Margaret!

SIR JOHN

F indeed! A very promising letter.

Let me--F, F, Fo, Fa... Upon my word,

but I cannot think of a single name

beginning with F--

MRS JENNINGS

Forrest? Foster? Frost? Foggarty?

MARIANNE

(controlled fury)

Sir John, might I play your

pianoforte?

SIR JOHN

Of course, yes--my goodness. We do

not stand on ceremony here, my dear.

SIR JOHN

Brandon! Where have you been? Come,

come and meet our beautiful new

neighbours!

MRS JENNINGS

What a pity you are late, Colonel!

You have missed the most delightful

singing!

COLONEL BRANDON

A great pity, indeed.

SIR JOHN

Mrs Dashwood, may I present my dear

friend Colonel Brandon? We served

together in the East Indies and I

assure you there is no better fellow

on earth--

MARGARET

Have you really been to the East

Indies, Colonel?

COLONEL BRANDON

I have.

MARGARET

What is it like?

SIR JOHN

Like? Hot.

COLONEL BRANDON

(mysteriously)

The air is full of spices.

SIR JOHN

Come, Miss Dashwood--it is your turn

to entertain us!

ELINOR

Oh no, Sir John, I do not--

SIR JOHN

--and I think we can all guess what

key you will sing in!

SIR JOHN/MRS JENNINGS

F major!

MARIANNE

(to Margaret)

As for you, you have no right, no

right at all, to parade your ignorant

assumptions--

MARGARET

They are not assumptions. You told

me.

MARIANNE

I told you nothing--

MARGARET

They'll meet him when he comes,

anyway.

MARIANNE

That is not the point. You do not

speak of such things before strangers--

MARGARET

But everyone else was--

MARIANNE

Mrs Jennings is not everyone.

MARGARET

I like her! She talks about things.

We never talk about things.

MRS DASHWOOD

Hush, please, now that is enough,

Margaret. If you cannot think of

anything appropriate to say, you

will please restrict your remarks to

the weather.

MARGARET

I like Colonel Brandon too. He's

been to places.

SIR JOHN

You know what they're saying, of

course...

SIR JOHN

The word is that you have developed

a taste for--certain company.

SIR JOHN

And why not, say I. A man like you--

in his prime--she'd be a most

fortunate young lady--

COLONEL BRANDON

Marianne Dashwood would no more think

of me than she would of you, John.

SIR JOHN

Brandon, my boy, do not think of

yourself so meanly--

COLONEL BRANDON

And all the better for her.

MRS JENNINGS

(stage whisper)

Besotted! Excellent match, for he is

rich and she is handsome.

ELINOR

How long have you known the Colonel?

MRS JENNINGS

Oh, Lord bless you, as long as ever

I have been here, and I came fifteen

years back. His estate at Delaford

is but four miles hence and he and

John are very thick. He has no wife

or children of his own, for--

MRS JENNINGS

--he has a tragic history. He loved

a girl once--twenty years ago now--a

ward to his family, but they were

not permitted to marry...

ELINOR

On what grounds?

MRS JENNINGS

Money. Eliza was poor. When the father

discovered their amour, she was flung

out of the house and he packed off

into the army. I believe he would

have done himself a harm if not for

John...

ELINOR

What became of the lady?

MRS JENNINGS

Oh, she was passed from man to man--

disappeared from all good society.

When Brandon got back from India he

searched for heaven knows how long,

only to find her dying in a poor

house. You have seen how it has

affected him. Once I thought my

daughter Charlotte might have cheered

him up, but she is much better off

where she is.

MRS JENNINGS

Look at him now, though. So attentive.

I shall try an experiment on him.

ELINOR

Oh no, please, dear Mrs Jennings,

leave the poor Colonel alone.

MRS JENNINGS

No, no, it is just the thing--all

suitors need a little help, my dear

MRS JENNINGS

(trillingly)

Colonel Brandon!

MRS JENNINGS

We have not heard you play for us of

late!

COLONEL BRANDON

For the simple reason that you have

a far superior musician here.

MRS JENNINGS

Perhaps you did not know, Miss

Marianne, that our dear Brandon shares

your passion for music and plays the

piano forte very well.

MRS JENNINGS

Play us a duet!

MRS JENNINGS

I'll trow you know quite as many

melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne!

MRS JENNINGS

Come! Let us see you both side by

side!

MARIANNE

I do not know any duets. Forgive me,

Colonel.

MARIANNE

Oh! Are we never to have a moment's

peace? The rent here may be low but

I think we have it on very hard terms.

ELINOR

Mrs Jennings is a wealthy woman with

a married daughter--she has nothing

to do but marry off everyone else's.

BETSY

There's a parcel arrived for you,

Miss Dashwood!

MARGARET

A parcel!

MARIANNE

It is too ridiculous! When is a man

to be safe from such wit if age and

infirmity do not protect him?

ELINOR

Infirmity!

MRS DASHWOOD

If Colonel Brandon is infirm, then I

am at death's door.

ELINOR

It is a miracle your life has extended

this far...

MARIANNE

Did you not hear him complain of a

rheumatism in his shoulder?

ELINOR

A slight ache' I believe was his

phrase...

MARGARET

But Edward said he would bring it

himself.

MRS DASHWOOD

'Dear Mrs Dashwood, Miss Dashwood,

Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret--

it gives me great pleasure to restore

this atlas to its rightful owner.

Alas, business in London does not

permit me to accompany it, although

this is likely to hurt me far more

than it hurts you. For the present

my memories of your kindness must be

enough to sustain me, and I remain

your devoted servant always. E. C.

Ferrars.'

MARGARET

But why hasn't he come?

MRS DASHWOOD

He says he is busy, dear.

MARGARET

He said he'd come.

MARGARET

Why hasn't he come?

MARIANNE

I am taking you for a walk.

MARGARET

No! I've been a walk.

MARIANNE

You need another.

MARGARET

It is going to rain.

MARIANNE

It is not going to rain.

MARGARET

You always say that and then it always

does.

MRS DASHWOOD

I fear Mrs Jennings is a bad

influence.

MRS DASHWOOD

You must miss him, Elinor.

ELINOR

We are not engaged, Mamma.

MRS DASHWOOD

But he loves you, dearest, of that I

am certain.

ELINOR

I am by no means assured of his regard

for me.

MRS DASHWOOD

Oh, Elinor!

ELINOR

But even were he to feel such a...

preference, I think we should be

foolish to assume that there would

not be many obstacles to his choosing

a woman of no rank who cannot afford

to buy sugar...

MRS DASHWOOD

But Elinor--your heart must tell you--

ELINOR

In such a situation, Mamma, it is

perhaps better to use one's head.

MARIANNE

Is there any felicity in the world

superior to this?

MARGARET

I told you it would rain.

MARIANNE

Look! There is some blue sky! Let us

chase it!

MARGARET

I'm not supposed to run.

MARGARET

Marianne!

MARIANNE

Help me!

MARIANNE

Margaret, run home and fetch help.

MARGARET

I think it is this way. I will run

as fast as I can, Marianne.

THE STRANGER

Are you hurt?

MARIANNE

(transfixed)

Only my ankle.

THE STRANGER

May I have your permission to--

THE STRANGER

--ascertain if there are any breaks?

THE STRANGER

It is not broken. Now, can you put

your arm about my neck?

THE STRANGER

Allow me to escort you home.

MRS DASHWOOD

Marianne was sure it would not rain.

ELINOR

Which invariably means it will.

MRS DASHWOOD

At last!

MARGARET

She fell over! She fell down--and

he's carrying her!

MRS DASHWOOD

Marianne!

ELINOR

In here, sir--this way. Margaret,

open the door wider. Please, sir,

lay her here. Marianne, are you in

pain?

THE STRANGER

It is a twisted ankle.

MARIANNE

Do not be alarmed, Mamma.

THE STRANGER

I can assure you it is not serious.

I took the liberty of feeling the

bone and it is perfectly sound.

MRS DASHWOOD

Sir, I cannot even begin to thank

you.

THE STRANGER

Please do not think of it. I'm

honoured of be of service.

MRS DASHWOOD

Will you not be seated?

THE STRANGER

Pray excuse me--I have no desire to

leave a water mark! But permit me to

call tomorrow afternoon and inquire

after the patient?

MRS DASHWOOD

We shall look forward to it!

MARIANNE

(hissing)

His name! His name!

MRS DASHWOOD

Please tell us to whom we are so

much obliged?

THE STRANGER

John Willoughby of Allenham--your

servant, ma'am!

MARIANNE

Mr John Willoughby of Allenham!

MRS DASHWOOD

What an impressive gentleman!

MARIANNE

He lifted me as if I weighed no more

than a dried leaf!

ELINOR

Is he human?

MRS DASHWOOD

Tell me if I hurt you.

ELINOR

(regarding Marianne's

ecstatic expression)

She feels no pain, Mamma. Margaret,

ask Betsy to make up a cold compress,

please.

MARGARET

(leaving reluctantly)

Did you see him? He expressed himself

well, did he not?

MRS DASHWOOD

With great decorum and honour.

MARIANNE

And spirit and wit and feeling.

ELINOR

And economy--ten words at most.

MARIANNE

And he is to come tomorrow!

ELINOR

You must change, Marianne--you will

catch a cold.

MARIANNE

What care I for colds when there is

such a man?

ELINOR

You will care very much when your

nose swells up.

MARIANNE

You are right. Help me, Elinor.

MARGARET

What has happened?

ELINOR

We have decided to give you to the

Gypsies.

MARGARET

Will they be married before Edward

and Elinor, do you think, Mamma?

MRS DASHWOOD

Margaret, you are worse than Mrs

Jennings.

SIR JOHN (V.O.)

Mr Willoughby is well worth catching,

Miss Dashwood--Miss Marianne must

not expect to have all the men to

herself!

MARIANNE

But what do you know of Mr Willoughby,

Sir John?

SIR JOHN

Decent shot--and there is not a bolder

rider in all England.

MARIANNE

But what is he like?

SIR JOHN

Like?

MARIANNE

What are his tastes? His passions?

His pursuits?

SIR JOHN

(mystified)

Well, he has the nicest little bitch

of a pointer--was she out with him

yesterday?

MRS DASHWOOD

Where is Allenham, Sir John?

SIR JOHN

Nice little estate three miles east.

He is to inherit it from an elderly

relative--Lady Allen is her name.

MARGARET

It is Colonel Brandon. I shall go

outside and keep watch.

SIR JOHN

You are all on the lookout for

Willoughby, eh? Dear me, poor Brandon.

You will none of you think of him

now.

COLONEL BRANDON

How is the invalid?

MARIANNE

Thank you so much, Colonel.

SIR JOHN

Miss Marianne, I cannot see why you

should set your cap at Mr Willoughby

when you have already made such a

splendid conquest!

MARIANNE

I have no intention of 'setting my

cap' at anyone, Sir John!

COLONEL BRANDON

Mr Willoughby--Lady Allen's nephew?

SIR JOHN

Aye, he visits every year for he is

to inherit Allenham--and he has a

very pretty estate of his own, Miss

Dashwood, Combe Magna in Somerset.

If I were you, I would not give him

up to my younger sister in spite of

all this tumbling down hills.

SIR JOHN

Here is the man himself. Come, Brandon--

we know when we are not wanted. Let

us leave him to the ladies!

ELINOR

Marianne! Sir John and the Colonel

are leaving.

MARIANNE

Goodbye, Colonel. Thank you for the

flowers.

WILLOUGHBY

How do you do, Colonel?

SIR JOHN

How does he do? How do you do, more

like. Go on in, they're waiting for

you!

MRS DASHWOOD

Mr Willoughby! What a pleasure to

see you again!

WILLOUGHBY

The pleasure is all mine, I can

asstire you. I trust Miss Marianne

has not caught cold?

MARIANNE

You have found out my name!

WILLOUGHBY

Of course. The neighbourhood is

crawling with my spies.

WILLOUGHBY

And since you cannot venture out to

nature, nature must be brought to

you!

MARIANNE

How beautiful. These are not from

the hothouse.

WILLOUGHBY

Ah! I see mine is not the first

offering, nor the most elegant. I am

afraid I obtained these from an

obliging field.

MARIANNE

But I have always preferred wild

flowers!

WILLOUGHBY

I suspected as much.

ELINOR

I will put these in water.

MRS DASHWOOD

Our gratitude, Mr Willoughby, is

beyond expression--

WILLOUGHBY

But it is I who am grateful. I have

often passed this cottage and grieved

for its lonely state--and then the

first news I had from Lady Allen

when I arrived was that it was taken.

I felt a peculiar interest in the

event which nothing can account for

but my present delight in meeting

you.

MRS DASHWOOD

Pray sit down, Mr Willoughby.

WILLOUGHBY

Who is reading Shakespeare's sonnets?

MARIANNE/ELINOR/MRS DASHWOOD

I am. / We all are. / Marianne.

MRS DASHWOOD

Marianne has been reading them out

to us.

WILLOUGHBY

Which are your favourites?

MARIANNE

Without a doubt, mine is 116.

WILLOUGHBY

Let me not to the marriage of true

minds Admit impediments. Love is not

love Which alters when it alteration

finds, Or bends with the remover to

remove--then how does it go?

MARIANNE

'0, no! it is an ever-fixed mark.'

WILLOUGHBY

'That looks on storms'--or is it

tempests? Let me find it.

WILLOUGHBY

It is strange you should be reading

them--for, look, I carry this with

me always.

WILLOUGHBY

Till tomorrow! And my pocket sonnets

are yours, Miss Marianne! A talisman

against further injury!

MARIANNE

Goodbye! Thank you!

ELINOR

Good work, Marianne! You have covered

all forms of poetry; another meeting

will ascertain his views on nature

and romantic attachments and then

you will have nothing left to talk

about and the acquaintanceship will

be over.

MARIANNE

I suppose I have erred against

decorum. I should have been dull and

spiritless and talked only of the

weather, or the state of the roads.

ELINOR

No, but Mr Willoughby can be in no

doubt of your enthusiasm for him.

MARIANNE

Why should he doubt it? Why should I

hide my regard?

ELINOR

No particular reason, Marianne, only

that we know so little of him--

MARIANNE

But time alone does not determine

intimacy. Seven years would be

insufficient to make some people

acquainted with each other and seven

days are more than enough for others.

ELINOR

Or seven hours in this case.

MARIANNE

I feel I know Mr Willoughby well

already. If I had weaker, more shallow

feelings perhaps I could conceal

them, as you do--

MRS DASHWOOD

Marianne, that is not fair--

MARIANNE

I am sorry, Elinor, I did not mean

ELINOR

I know. Do not trouble yourself,

Marianne.

MARIANNE

I do not understand her, Mamma. Why

does she never mention Edward? I

have never even seen her cry about

him, or about Norland.

MRS DASHWOOD

Nor I. But Elinor is not like you or

I, dear. She does not like to be

swayed by her emotions.

MRS DASHWOOD

Surely you are not going to deny us

beef as well as sugar?

ELINOR

There is nothing under tenpence a

pound. We have to economise.

MRS DASHWOOD

Do you want us to starve?

ELINOR

No. Just not to eat beef.

MARIANNE

If there was any true impropriety in

my behaviour, I should be sensible

of it, Elinor--

ELINOR

But as it has already exposed you to

some very impertinent remarks, do

you not begin to doubt your own

discretion?

MARIANNE

If the impertinent remarks of such

as Mrs Jennings are proof of

impropriety, then we are all offending

every moment of our lives--

COLONEL BRANDON

(dismounting)

Miss Dashwood! Miss Marianne!

ELINOR

Good morning, Colonel!

COLONEL BRANDON

I come to issue an invitation. A

picnic on my estate at Delaford--if

you would care to join us on Thursday

next. Mrs Jennings's daughter and

her husband are traveling up

especially.

ELINOR

Thank you, Colonel, we shall be

delighted.

COLONEL BRANDON

(to Marianne)

I will of course be including Mr

Willoughby in the party.

MARIANNE

I should be delighted to join you,

Colonel!

WILLOUGHBY

Good morning, Miss Dashwood; good

morning, Colonel.

MARIANNE

The Colonel has invited us to

Delaford, Willoughby!

WILLOUGHBY

Excellent. I understand you have a

particularly fine pianoforte, Colonel.

COLONEL BRANDON

A Broadwood Grand.

MARIANNE

A Broadwood Grand! Then I shall really

be able to play for you!

WILLOUGHBY

We shall look forward to it!

COLONEL BRANDON

Your sister seems very happy.

ELINOR

Yes. Marianne does not approve of

hiding her emotions. In fact, her

romantic prejudices have the

unfortunate tendency to set propriety

at naught.

COLONEL BRANDON

She is wholly unspoilt.

ELINOR

Rather too unspoilt, in my view. The

sooner she becomes acquainted with

the ways of the world, the better.

COLONEL BRANDON

I knew a lady like your sister--the

same impulsive sweetness of temper--

who was forced into, as you put it,

a better acquaintance with the world.

The result was only ruination and

despair.

COLONEL BRANDON

Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood.

MRS JENNINGS

Imagine my surprise, Mrs Dashwood,

when Charlotte and her lord and master

appeared with our cousin Lucy! The

last person I expected to see! 'Where

did you pop out from, Miss?' says I.

I was never so surprised to see anyone

in all my life!

MRS JENNINGS

She probably came on purpose to share

the fun, for there are no funds for

such luxuries at home, poor thing.

LUCY

I had not seen you for so long, dear

Mrs Jennings, I could not resist the

opportunity.

CHARLOTTE

Oh, you sly thing! It was the Misses

Dashwood she wanted to see, not

Delaford, Mamma! I have heard nothing

but 'Miss Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood

that' for I don't know how long! And

what do you think of them now you do

see them, Lucy? My mother has talked

of nothing else in her letters since

you came to Barton, Mrs Dashwood. Mr

Palmer--are they not the very

creatures she describes?

MR PALMER

Nothing like.

CHARLOTTE

(laughing gaily)

Why, Mr Palmer! Do you know you are

quite rude today? He is to be an MP,

you know, Mrs Dashwood, and it is

very fatiguing for him for he is

forced to make everybody like him--

he says it is quite shocking--

MRS PALMER

I never said anything so irrational.

Don't palm all your abuses of the

language upon me.

MRS JENNINGS

(to Mrs Dashwood)

Mr Palmer is so droll--he is always

out of humour.

MRS JENNINGS

Here he is! Now you shall see,

Charlotte.

MRS JENNINGS

How now, Mr Willoughby! You must

greet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr

Palmer--

WILLOUGHBY

How do you do?

MRS JENNINGS

And my little cousin, Miss Lucy

Steele.

WILLOUGHBY

Welcome to our party, Miss Steele!

CHARLOTTE

I know Mr Willoughby extremely well--

not that I ever spoke to him but I

have seen him forever in town. Your

sister is monstrous lucky to get

him. Mamma says Colonel Brandon is

in love with her as well, which is a

very great compliment for he hardly

ever falls in love with anyone.

LUCY

May I beg a seat beside you, Miss

Dashwood? I have so longed to make

your better acquaintance! I have

heard nothing but the highest praise

for you.

ELINOR

I would be delighted. But Sir John

and Mrs Jennings are too excessive

in their compliments. I am sure to

disappoint.

LUCY

No, for it was from quite another

source that I heard you praised and

one not at all inclined to

exaggeration.

SIR JOHN

What can this be?

COLONEL BRANDON

My horse! Quickly!

SIR JOHN

What is the matter, Brandon?

COLONEL BRANDON

I must away to London.

SIR JOHN

No! Impossible!

COLONEL BRANDON

Imperative.

SIR JOHN

But Brandon, we are all assembled.

We cannot picnic at Delaford without

our host! Go up to town tomorrow.

WILLOUGHBY

Or wait till we return and start

then--you would not be six hours

later.

COLONEL BRANDON

I cannot afford to lose one minute.

LUCY

Oh, Miss Dashwood, I cannot bear it!

Just when I was to have the

opportunity of speaking with you.

WILLOUGHBY

Frailty, thy name is Brandon!

MARIANNE

There are some people who cannot

bear a party of pleasure. I think he

wrote the letter himself as a trick

for getting out of it.

MRS DASHWOOD

(indulgently)

You are a very wicked pair, Colonel

Brandon will be sadly missed.

WILLOUGHBY

Why? When he is the kind of man that

everyone speaks well of and no one

wants to talk to.

MARIANNE

Exactly!

ELINOR

Nonsense.

MRS DASHWOOD

Colonel Brandon is very highly

esteemed at the Park.

WILLOUGHBY

Which is enough censure in itself.

ELINOR

(half laughing)

Really, Willoughby!

WILLOUGHBY

(imitating Mrs Jennings

perfectly)

Come, come, Mr Impudence--I know you

and your wicked ways--oh!

WILLOUGHBY

Come, Miss Dashwood, reveal your

beau, reveal him, I say! Let's have

no secrets between friends! Let me

winkle them out of you!

WILLOUGHBY

(as Mrs Jennings)

I declare, Miss Marianne, if I do

not have you married to the Colonel

by teatime, I shall swallow my own

bonnet.

WILLOUGHBY

As if you could marry such a

character.

ELINOR

Why should you dislike him?

WILLOUGHBY

Because he has threatened me with

rain when I wanted it fine, he has

found fault with the balance of my

curricle and I cannot persuade him

to buy my brown mare. If it will be

of any satisfaction to you, however,

to be told I believe his character

to be in all other respects

irreproachable, I am ready to confess

it. And in return for an

acknowledgement that must give me

some pain.

(he is slowing down)

You cannot deny me the privilege...

(slower still)

of disliking him...

(and stopping)

as much as I adore...

WILLOUGHBY

--this cottage!

MRS DASHWOOD

I have great plans for improvements

to it, you know, Mr Willoughby.

WILLOUGHBY

Now that I will never consent to.

Not a stone must be added to its

walls. Were I rich enough, I would

instantly pull down Combe Magna and

build it up again in the exact image

of that cottage!

ELINOR

With dark, narrow stairs, a poky

hall and a fire that smokes?

WILLOUGHBY

Especially the fire that smokes!

Then I might be as happy at Combe

Magna as I have been at Barton.

WILLOUGHBY

But this place has one claim on my

affection which no other can possibly

share.

WILLOUGHBY

Promise me you will never change it.

MRS DASHWOOD

I do not have the heart.

ELINOR

Or the money.

WILLOUGHBY

Miss Marianne, will you--will you do

me the honour of granting me an

interview tomorrow--alone?

MARIANNE

Willoughby, we are always alone!

WILLOUGHBY

But there is something very particular

I should like to ask you.

MARIANNE

Of course. I shall ask Mamma if I

may stay behind from church.

WILLOUGHBY

Thank you. Until tomorrow then--Miss

Marianne.

MARGARET

Do you think he will kneel down when

he asks her?

ELINOR

Shhh!

MARGARET

(with satisfaction)

They always kneel down.

MRS DASHWOOD

What is wrong, my dearest?

MRS DASHWOOD

Willoughby! What is the matter?

WILLOUGHBY

I--forgive me, Mrs Dashwood. I am

sent--that is to say, Lady Allen has

exercised the privilege of riches

upon a dependent cousin and is sending

me to London.

MRS DASHWOOD

When--this morning?

WILLOUGHBY

Almost this moment.

MRS DASHWOOD

How very disappointing! But your

business will not detain you from us

for long, I hope?

WILLOUGHBY

You are very kind--but I have no

idea of returning immediately to

Devonshire. I am seldom invited to

Allenham more than once a year.

MRS DASHWOOD

For shame, Willoughby! Can you wait

for an invitation from Barton Cottage?

WILLOUGHBY

My engagements at present are of

such a nature--that is--I dare not

flatter myself--

WILLOUGHBY

It is folly to linger in this manner.

I will not torment myself further.

MARGARET

Willoughby, come back!

ELINOR

Meg, dearest, please ask Betsy to

make a cup of hot tea for Marianne.

MRS DASHWOOD

What is wrong, my love?

MARIANNE

Nothing! Please do not ask me

questions!

MARIANNE

Please let me be!

ELINOR

They must have quarreled.

MRS DASHWOOD

That is unlikely. Perhaps this--Lady

Allen--disapproves of his regard for

Marianne and has invented an excuse

to send him away?

ELINOR

Then why did he not say as much? It

is not like Willoughby to be

secretive. Did he think Marianne was

richer than she is?

MRS DASHWOOD

How could he?

MRS DASHWOOD

What is it you suspect him of?

ELINOR

I can hardly tell you. But why was

his manner so guilty?

MRS DASHWOOD

What are you saying, Elinor? That he

has been acting a part to your sister

for all this time?

ELINOR

No, he loves her, I am sure.

MRS DASHWOOD

Of course he loves her!

ELINOR

But has he left her with any assurance

of his return? Cannot you ask her if

he has proposed?

MRS DASHWOOD

Certainly not. I cannot force a

confidence from Marianne and nor

must you. We must trust her to confide

in us in her own time.

ELINOR

(shaking her head)

There was something so underhand in

the manner of his leaving.

MRS DASHWOOD

You are resolved, then, to think the

worst of him.

ELINOR

Not resolved--

MRS DASHWOOD

(cold)

I prefer to give him the benefit of

my good opinion. He deserves no less.

From all of us.

ELINOR

Mamma, I am very fond of Willoughby--

MARGARET

She would not let me in.

MARIANNE

How like a winter hath my absence

been from thee, the pleasure of the

fleeting year! What freezings have I

felt, what dark days seen! What old

December's bareness everywhere!

CHARLOTTE

Oh! If only this rain would stop!

MR PALMER

(from behind the paper)

If only you would stop.

MRS JENNINGS

'Twas you took her off my hands, Mr

Palmer, and a very good bargain you

made of it too, but now I have the

whip hand over you for you cannot

give her back!

MRS JENNINGS

Miss Marianne, come and play a round

with us! Looking out at the weather

will not bring him back.

CHARLOTTE

(sotto voce)

She ate nothing at dinner.

MRS JENNINGS

Mind, we are all a little forlorn

these days. London has swallowed all

our company.

LUCY

(low)

Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now we

might have our--discussion.

ELINOR

Our discussion?

LUCY

There is a particular question I

have long wanted to ask you, but

perhaps you will think me impertinent?

ELINOR

I cannot imagine so.

LUCY

But it is an odd question. Forgive

me, I have no wish to trouble you--

ELINOR

My dear Miss Steele--

CHARLOTTE

(interrupting)

Miss Dashwood, if only Mr Willoughby

had gone home to Combe Magna, we

could have taken Miss Marianne to

see him! For we live but half a mile

away.

MR PALMER

Five and a half.

CHARLOTTE

No, I cannot believe it is that far,

for you can see the place from the

top of our hill. Is it really five

and a half miles? No! I cannot believe

it.

MR PALMER

Try.

ELINOR

You have my permission to ask any

manner of question, if that is of

any help.

LUCY

Thank you. I wonder, are you at all

acquainted with your sister-in-law's

mother? Mrs Ferrars?

ELINOR

With Fanny's mother? No, I have never

met her.

LUCY

I am sure you think me strange for

inquiring--if I dared tell--

MRS JENNINGS

(shouting over)

If she tells you aught of the famous

'Mr F', Lucy, you are to pass it on.

LUCY

Will you take a turn with me, Miss

Dashwood?

ELINOR

I had no idea at all that you were

connected with that family.

LUCY

Oh! I am certainly nothing to Mrs

Ferrars at present--but the time may

come when we may be very intimately

connected.

ELINOR

(low)

What do you mean? Do you have an

understanding with Fanny's brother

Robert?

LUCY

The youngest? No, I never saw him in

my life. No, with Edward.

ELINOR

Edward?

ELINOR

Edward Ferrars?

LUCY

Edward and I have been secretly

engaged these five years.

LUCY

You may well be surprised. I should

never have mentioned it, had I not

known I could entirely trust you to

keep our secret. Edward cannot mind

me telling you for he looks on you

quite as his own sister.

ELINOR

I am sorry, but we surely--we cannot

mean the same Mr Ferrars?

LUCY

The very same--he was four years

under the tutelage of my uncle Mr

Pratt, down in Plymouth. Has he never

spoken of it?

ELINOR

(awareness dawning)

Mr Pratt! Yes, I believe he has.

LUCY

I was very unwilling to enter into

it without his mother's approval but

we loved each other with too great a

passion for prudence. Though you do

nor know him so well as I, Miss

Dashwood, you must have seen how

capable he is of making a woman

sincerely attached to him. I cannot

pretend it has not been very hard on

us both. We can hardly meet above

twice a year.

LUCY

You seem out of sorts, Miss Dashwood--

are you quite well?

ELINOR

Perfectly well, thank you.

LUCY

I have not offended you?

ELINOR

On the contrary.

MRS JENNINGS

I can stand it no longer, I must

know what you are saying, Lucy! Miss

Dashwood is quite engrossed!

LUCY

Oh, Miss Dashwood, if anyone finds

out, it will ruin him--you must not

tell a soul! Edward says you would

not break your word to save your

life! Promise me!

ELINOR

I give you my word.

MRS JENNINGS

Well, what can have fascinated you

to such an extent, Miss Dashwood?

CHARLOTTE

Tell us all!

LUCY

We were talking of London, ma'am,

and all its--diversions.

MRS JENNINGS

Do you hear, Charlotte?

MRS JENNINGS

While you were so busy whispering,

Charlotte and I have concocted a

plan!

CHARLOTTE

It is the best plan in the world.

MRS JENNINGS

I make for London shortly and I invite

you, Lucy, and both the Misses

Dashwood to join me!

MARIANNE

London!

MARGARET

Oh, can I go! Can I go?

MRS DASHWOOD

You know perfectly well you are too

young, dearest.

MRS JENNINGS

I shall convey you all to my house

in Berkeley Street and we shall taste

all the delights of the season--what

say you?

MARGARET

Oh, please can I go? I'm twelve soon.

CHARLOTTE

Mr Palmer, do you not long to have

the Misses Dashwood come to London?

MR PALMER

I came into Devonshire with no other

view.

ELINOR

Mrs Jennings, you are very kind, but

we cannot possibly leave our mother...

LUCY

Indeed, the loss would be too great.

MRS JENNINGS

Your mother can spare you very well.

MRS DASHWOOD

Of course I can!

CHARLOTTE

Of course she can!

SIR JOHN

And look at Miss Marianne--it would

break her heart to deny her!

MRS JENNINGS

I will brook no refusal, Miss

Dashwood!

MRS JENNINGS

Let you and me strike hands upon the

bargain--and if I do not have the

three of you married by Christmas,

it will not be my fault!

MARIANNE

I was never so grateful in all my

life as I am to Mrs Jennings. What a

kind woman she is! I like her more

than I can say. Oh, Elinor! I shall

see Willoughby. Think how surprised

he will be! And you will see Edward!

MARIANNE

Are you asleep?

ELINOR

With you in the room?

MARIANNE

I do not believe you feel as calm as

you look, not even you, Elinor. I

will never sleep tonight! Oh, what

were you and Miss Steele whispering

about so long?

ELINOR

Nothing of significance.

LUCY

I have written to Edward, Miss

Dashwood, and yet I do not know how

much I may see of him. Secrecy is

vital--he will never be able to call.

ELINOR

I should imagine not.

LUCY

It is so hard. I believe my only

comfort has been the constancy of

his affection.

ELINOR

You are fortunate, over such a lengthy

engagement, never to have had any

doubts on that score.

LUCY

Oh! I am of rather a jealous nature

and if he had talked more of one

young lady than any other... but he

has never given a moment's alarm on

that count.

LUCY

Imagine how glad he will be to learn

that we are friends!

MRS JENNINGS

To be sure, my dear, you must just

hand it to Pigeon there. He will

take care of it.

MRS JENNINGS

Lord above, you do not waste any

time, Miss Marianne!

LUCY

A letter! So they are definitely

engaged! Mrs Jennings says your sister

will buy her wedding clothes here in

town.

ELINOR

Indeed Miss Steele, I know of no

such plan.

ELINOR

John and Fanny are in town. I think

we shall be forced to see them.

ELINOR

I think it was for next door.

MARIANNE

Yes, you are right.

MARIANNE

Oh, Elinor! It is Willoughby, indeed

it is!

MARIANNE

Oh! Excuse me, Colonel--

ELINOR

Colonel Brandon, what a pleasure to

see you! Have you been in London all

this while?

COLONEL BRANDON

I have. How is your dear mother?

ELINOR

Very well, thank you.

ELINOR

Colonel, is there anything--

COLONEL BRANDON

Forgive me, Miss Dashwood, but I

have heard reports through town...

is it impossible to--but I could

have no chance of succeeding--indeed

I hardly know what to do. Tell me

once and for all, is everything

finally resolved between your sister

and Mr Willoughby?

ELINOR

Colonel, though neither one has

informed me of their under standing,

I have no doubt of their mutual

affection.

COLONEL BRANDON

Thank you, Miss Dashwood. To your

sister I wish all imaginable

happiness. To Mr Willoughby, that

he... may endeavour to deserve her.

ELINOR

What do you mean?

COLONEL BRANDON

Forgive me, I--forgive me.

MARIANNE

Where is dear Edward, John? We expect

to see him daily.

MRS JENNINGS

And who is 'dear Edward'?

CHARLOTTE

Who indeed?

FANNY

My brother, Mrs Jennings--Edward

Ferrars.

MRS JENNINGS

Indeed! Is that Ferrars with an F?

MARIANNE

Are there any messages, Pigeon?

PIGEON

No, ma'am.

MARIANNE

No message at all? No cards?

PIGEON

(affronted)

None, ma am.

MRS JENNINGS

I note you do not inquire for your

messages, Miss Dashwood!

ELINOR

No, for I do not expect any, Mrs

Jennings. I have very little

acquaintance in town.

MRS JENNINGS

She is as sly as you, Lucy!

ELINOR

Marianne, is anything wrong?

MARIANNE

Nothing at all. Go back to sleep.

PIGEON

No messages, ma am.

MRS JENNINGS

Do not fret, my dear. I am told that

this good weather is keeping many

sportsmen in the country at present,

but the frost will drive them back

to town very soon, depend upon it.

MARIANNE

Of course! I had not thought of--

thank you, Mrs Jennings!

MRS JENNINGS

And Miss Dashwood may set her heart

at rest, for I overheard your sister-

in-law say that she was to bring the

elusive Mr F to the ball tonight!

CHARLOTTE

(screeching)

This is very merry!

MRS JENNINGS

There you are! Goodness, how hot it

is, Mrs Dashwood. You are not alone,

I trust?

FANNY

Indeed not. John is just gone to

fetch my brother--he has been eating

ices.

MRS JENNINGS

Your brother! I declare, that is

good news indeed. At long last!

LUCY

(whispering)

Miss Dashwood, I declare I shall

faint clean away.

JOHN

Mrs Jennings, may I present my brother-

in-law?

JOHN

Mr Robert Ferrars!

ROBERT

My dear ladies--we meet at last!

MRS JENNINGS

So you must be the younger brother?

Is Mr Edward not here? Miss Dashwood

here was counting on him!

ROBERT

Oh! He is far too busy for such

gatherings--and has no special

acquaintance here to make his

attendance worthwhile.

MRS JENNINGS

Well, I declare, I do not know what

the young men are about these days--

are they all in hiding?

MRS JENNINGS

Come, Mr Robert, in the absence of

your brother, you must dance with

our lovely Miss Dashwood!

ROBERT

(not best pleased)

It would be my honour.

ROBERT

And perhaps Miss Steele might consider

reserving the allemande?

ROBERT

You reside in Devonshire, I b'lieve,

Miss Dashwood?

ELINOR

We do.

ROBERT

In a cottage?

ELINOR

Yes.

ROBERT

I am excessively fond of a cottage.

If I had any money to spare, I should

build one myself.

WILLOUGHBY

(stiff)

How do you do, Miss Dashwood?

ELINOR

I am well, thank you, Mr Willoughby.

WILLOUGHBY

How is your--family?

ELINOR

(cold)

We are all extremely well, Mr

Willoughby--thank you for your kind

inquiry.

MARIANNE

Willoughby!

MARIANNE

Good God, Willoughby! Will you nor

shake hands with me?

WILLOUGHBY

(strangled)

How do you do, Miss Marianne?

MARIANNE

Willoughby, what is the matter? Why

have you not come to see me? Were

you not in London? Have you nor

received my letters?

WILLOUGHBY

Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving

the information which you were so

good as to send me.

MARIANNE

(piteously)

For heaven's sake, Willoughby, tell

me what is wrong!

WILLOUGHBY

Thank you--I am most obliged. If you

will excuse me, I must return to my

party.

MARIANNE

Willoughby!

ELINOR

Marianne! Come away!

MARIANNE

Go to him, Elinor--force him to come

to me.

ELINOR

Dearest, do not betray what you feel

to everyone present! This is not the

place for explanations--

MRS JENNINGS

Come along, dear.

MRS JENNINGS

Will you come, Lucy?

LUCY

Oh, are we leaving so soon?

ROBERT

If I might be so bold, Mrs Jennings,

it would be our pleasure to escort

your young charge home.

LUCY

How very kind!

MRS JENNINGS

That is very handsome--

ROBERT

She actually sent him messages during

the night?

ELINOR

Marianne, please tell me--

MARIANNE

Do not ask me questions!

ELINOR

You have no confidence in me.

MARIANNE

This reproach from you! You, who

confide in no one.

ELINOR

I have nothing to tell.

MARIANNE

Nor I. We have neither of us anything

to tell. I because I conceal nothing

and you because you communicate

nothing.

MRS JENNINGS

There now! Lovers' quarrels are swift

to heal! That letter will do the

trick, mark my word.

MRS JENNINGS

I must be off. I hope he won't keep

her waiting much longer, Miss

Dashwood. It hurts to see her looking

so forlorn.

LUCY

What a welcome I had from Edward's

family, Miss Dashwood--I am surprised

you never told me what an agreeable

woman your sister-in-law is! And Mr

Robert--all so affable!

ELINOR

It is perhaps fortunate that none of

them knows of your engagement. Excuse

me.

MARIANNE

'My dear Madam--I am quite at a loss

to discover in what point I could be

so unfortunate as to offend you. My

esteem for your family is very sincere

but if I have given rise to a belief

of more than I felt or meant to

express, I shall reproach myself for

not having been more guarded. My

affections have long been engaged

elsewhere and it is with great regret

that I return your letters and the

lock of hair which you so obligingly

bestowed upon me. I am etc. John

Willoughby.'

ELINOR

Oh, Marianne.

ELINOR

Marianne, oh, Marianne--it is better

to know at once what his intentions

are. Dearest, think of what you would

have felt if your engagement had

carried on for months and months

before he chose to put an end to it.

MARIANNE

We are not engaged.

ELINOR

But you wrote to him! I thought then

that he must have left you with some

kind of understanding?

MARIANNE

No--he is not so unworthy as you

think him.

ELINOR

Not so unworthy! Did he tell you

that he loved you?

MARIANNE

Yes. No--never absolutely. It was

every day implied, but never declared.

Sometimes I thought it had been, but

it never was. He has broken no vow.

ELINOR

He has broken faith with all of us,

he made us all believe he loved you.

MARIANNE

He did! He did--he loved me as I

loved him.

MRS JENNINGS

I had to come straight up--how are

you, Miss Marianne?

MRS JENNINGS

Poor thing! She looks very bad. No

wonder, Miss Dashwood, for it is but

too true. I was told here in the

street by Miss Morton, who is a great

friend: he is to be married at the

end of the month--to a Miss Grey

with fifty thousand pounds. Well,

said I, if 'tis true, then he is a

good-for-nothing who has used my

young friend abominably ill, and I

wish with all my soul that his wife

may plague his heart out!

MRS JENNINGS

But he is not the only young man

worth having, my dear, and with your

pretty face you will never want for

admirers.

MRS JENNINGS

Ah, me! She had better have her cry

out and have done with it. I will go

and look out something to tempt her--

does she care for olives?

ELINOR

I cannot tell you.

MARIANNE

I cannot believe his nature capable

of such cruelty!

ELINOR

Marianne, there is no excuse for him--

this is his hand--

MARIANNE

But it cannot be his heart! Oh, Mamma!

I want Mamma! Elinor, please take me

home! Cannot we go tomorrow?

ELINOR

There is no one to take us.

MARIANNE

Cannot we hire a carriage?

ELINOR

We have no money--and indeed we owe

Mrs Jennings more courtesy.

MARIANNE

All she wants is gossip and she only

likes me because I supply it! Oh,

God! I cannot endure to stay.

ELINOR

I will find a way. I promise.

ROBERT

Apparently they never were engaged.

FANNY

Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds.

Marianne is virtually penniless.

JOHN

She cannot have expected him to go

through with it. But I feel for

Marianne--she will lose her bloom

and end a spinster like Elinor. I

think, my dear, we might consider

having them to stay with us for a

few days--we are, after all, family,

and my father.

FANNY

My love, I would ask them with all

my heart, but I have already asked

Miss Steele for a visit and we cannot

deprive Mrs Jennings of all her

company at once. We can invite your

sisters some other year, you know,

and Miss Steele will profit far more

from your generosity--poor girl!

JOHN

That is very thoughtful, Fanny. We

shall ask Elinor and Marianne next

year, then... Certainly!

ELINOR

Thank you for coming, Colonel.

COLONEL BRANDON

How does your sister?

ELINOR

I must get her home as quickly as

possible. The Palmers can take us as

far as Cleveland, which is but a day

from Barton--

COLONEL BRANDON

Then permit me to accompany you and

take you straight on from Cleveland

to Barton myself.

ELINOR

I confess that is precisely what I

had hoped for. Marianne suffers

cruelly, and what pains me most is

how hard she tries to justify Mr

Willoughby. But you know her

disposition.

COLONEL BRANDON

Perhaps I--my regard for you all--

Miss Dashwood, will you allow me to

prove it by relating some

circumstances which nothing but an

earnest desire of being useful--

ELINOR

You have something to tell me of Mr

Willoughby.

COLONEL BRANDON

(nods)

When I quitted Barton last--but I

must go further back. A short account

of myself will be necessary. No

doubt... no doubt Mrs Jennings has

apprised you of certain events in my

past--the sad outcome of my connection

with a young woman named Eliza.

COLONEL BRANDON

What is not commonly known is that

twenty years ago, Eliza bore an

illegitimate child. The father,

whoever he was, abandoned them.

COLONEL BRANDON

As she lay dying, she begged me to

look after the child. Eliza died in

my arms, broken, wasted away--ah!

Miss Dashwood, such a subject--

untouched for so many years--it is

dangerous...

COLONEL BRANDON

I had failed Eliza in every other

way--I could not refuse her now. I

took the child--Beth is her name--

and placed her with a family where I

could be sure she would be well looked

after. I saw her whenever I could. I

saw that she was headstrong like her

mother--and, God forgive me, I

indulged her, I allowed her too much

freedom. Almost a year ago, she

disappeared.

ELINOR

Disappeared!

COLONEL BRANDON

I instigated a search but for eight

months I was left to imagine the

worst. At last, on the day of the

Delaford picnic, I received the first

news her. She was with child... and

the blackguard who had--

ELINOR

Good God. Do you mean--Willoughby?

COLONEL BRANDON

Before I could return to confront

him, Lady Allen learned of his

behaviour and turned him from the

house. He beat a hasty retreat to

London--

ELINOR

Yes! He left us that morning, without

any explanation!

COLONEL BRANDON

Lady Allen had annulled his legacy.

He was left with next to nothing,

and in danger of losing all that

remained to his debtors--

ELINOR

--and so abandoned Marianne for Miss

Grey and her fifty thousand pounds.

ELINOR

Have you seen Mr Willoughby since

you learned...?

BRANDON

(nodding)

We met by appointment, he to defend,

I to punish his conduct.

BRANDON

We returned unwounded, so the meeting

never got abroad.

ELINOR

Is Beth still in town?

COLONEL BRANDON

She has chosen to go into the country

for her confinement. Such has been

the unhappy resemblance between the

fate of mother and daughter, and so

imperfectly have I discharged my

trust.

COLONEL BRANDON

I would not have burdened you, Miss

Dashwood, had I not from my heart

believed it might, in time, lessen

your sister's regrets.

COLONEL BRANDON

I have described Mr Willoughby as

the worst of libertines--but I have

since learned from Lady Allen that

he did mean to propose that day.

Therefore I cannot deny that his

intentions towards Marianne were

honourable, and I feel certain he

would have married her, had it not

been for--for the money.

ELINOR

Dearest, was I right to tell you?

MARIANNE

Of course.

ELINOR

Whatever his past actions, whatever

his present course, at least you may

be certain that he loved you.

MARIANNE

But not enough. Not enough.

MRS JENNINGS

Here is someone to cheer you up,

Miss Dashwood!

LUCY

How is your dear sister, Miss

Dashwood? Poor thing! I must say, I

do not know what I should do if a

man treated me with so little respect.

ELINOR

I hope you are enjoying your stay

with John and Fanny, Miss Steele?

LUCY

I was never so happy in my entire

life, Miss Dashwood! I do believe

your sister-in-law has taken quite a

fancy to me. I had to come and tell

you--for you cannot imagine what has

happened!

ELINOR

No, I cannot.

LUCY

Yesterday I was introduced to Edward's

mother!

ELINOR

Indeed?

LUCY

And she was a vast deal more than

civil. I have not yet seen Edward

but now I feel sure to very soon--

MAID

There's a Mr Edward Ferrars to see

you, Miss Dashwood.

ELINOR

Do ask him to come up.

EDWARD

Miss Dashwood, how can I--

ELINOR

Mr Ferrars, what a pleasure to see

you. You... know Miss Steele, of

course.

EDWARD

How do you do, Miss Steele.

LUCY

I am well, thank you, Mr Ferrars.

ELINOR

Do sit down, Mr Ferrars.

LUCY

You must be surprised to find me

here, Mr Ferrars! I expect you thought

I was at your sister's house.

ELINOR

Let me call Marianne, Mr Ferrars.

She would be most disappointed to

miss you.

MARIANNE

Edward! I heard your voice! At last

you have found us!

EDWARD

Forgive me, Marianne, my visit is

shamefully overdue. You are pale. I

hope you have not been unwell?

MARIANNE

Oh, don't think of me--Elinor is

well, you see, that must be enough

for both of us!

EDWARD

How do you like London, Marianne?

MARIANNE

Not at all. The sight of you is all

the pleasure it has afforded, is

that not so, Elinor?

MARIANNE

Why have you taken so long to come

and see us?

EDWARD

I have been much engaged elsewhere.

MARIANNE

Engaged elsewhere! But what was that

when there were such friends to be

met?

LUCY

Perhaps, Miss Marianne, you think

young men never honour their

engagements, little or great.

MARIANNE

No, indeed--for Edward is the most

fearful of giving pain and the most

incapable of being selfish of anyone

I ever saw.

MARIANNE

Edward, will you not sit? Elinor,

help me to persuade him.

EDWARD

Forgive me but I must take my leave--

MARIANNE

But you are only just arrived!

EDWARD

You must excuse me, I have a

commission to attend to for Fanny--

LUCY

In that case perhaps you might escort

me back to your sister's house, Mr

Ferrars?

EDWARD

I would be honoured. Goodbye, Miss

Dashwood, Miss Marianne.

MARIANNE

Why did you not urge him to stay?

ELINOR

He must have had his reasons for

going.

MARIANNE

His reason was no doubt your coldness.

If I were Edward I would assume you

did not care for me at all.

LUCY

Poor Miss Marianne looked very badly

t'other day. When I think of her,

deserted and abandoned, it frightens

me to think I shall never marry.

FANNY

Nonsense. You will marry far better

than either of the Dashwood girls.

LUCY

How can that possibly be?

FANNY

You have ten times their sense and

looks.

LUCY

But I have no dowry.

FANNY

There are qualities which will always

make up for that, and you have them

in abundance. It would not surprise

me if you were to marry far and away

beyond your expectations.

LUCY

I wish it might be so. There is a

young man--

FANNY

Ah ha! I am glad to hear of it. Is

he of good breeding and fortune?

LUCY

Oh both--but his family would

certainly oppose the match.

FANNY

Tush! They will allow it as soon as

they see you, my dear.

LUCY

It is a very great secret. I have

told no one in the world for fear of

discovery.

FANNY

My dear, I am the soul of discretion.

LUCY

If I dared tell...

FANNY

I can assure you I am as silent as

the grave.

FANNY (V.O.)

Viper in my bosom!

MRS JENNINGS

Oh, my dears! What a commotion! Mr

Edward Ferrars--the very one I used

to joke you about, Miss Dashwood--

has been engaged these five years to

Lucy Steele!

MRS JENNINGS

Poor Mr Ferrars! His mother, who by

all accounts is very proud, demanded

that he break the engagement on pain

of disinheritance. But he has refused

to break his promise to Lucy. He has

stood by her, good man, and is cut

off without a penny! She has settled

it all irrevocably upon Mr Robert.

But I cannot stop, I must go to Lucy.

Your sister-in-law scolded her like

any fury--drove her to hysterics.

MARIANNE

How long have you known?

ELINOR

Since the evening Mrs Jennings offered

to take us to London.

MARIANNE

Why did you not tell me?

ELINOR

Lucy told me in the strictest

confidence.

ELINOR

I could not break my word.

MARIANNE

But Edward loves you.

ELINOR

He made me no promises. He tried to

tell me about Lucy.

MARIANNE

He cannot marry her.

ELINOR

Would you have him treat her even

worse than Willoughby has treated

you?

MARIANNE

No--but nor would I have him marry

where he does not love.

ELINOR

Edward made his promise a long time

ago, long before he met me. Though

he may... harbour some regret, I

believe he will be happy--in the

knowledge that he did his duty and

kept his word. After all--after all

that is bewitching in the idea of

one's happiness depending entirely

on one person, it is not always

possible. We must accept. Edward

will marry Lucy--and you and I will

go home.

MARIANNE

Always resignation and acceptance!

Always prudence and honour and duty!

Elinor, where is your heart?

ELINOR

What do you know of my heart? What

do you know of anything but your own

suffering? For weeks, Marianne, I

have had this pressing on me without

being at liberty to speak of it to a

single creature. It was forced upon

me by the very person whose prior

claims ruined all my hopes. I have

had to endure her exultation again

and again while knowing myself to be

divided from Edward forever. Believe

me, Marianne, had I not been bound

to silence I could have produced

proof enough of a broken heart even

for you.

MARIANNE

Oh, Elinor!

COLONEL BRANDON (V.O.)

I have heard that your friend Mr

Ferrars has been entirely cast off

by his family for persevering in his

engagement to Miss Steele.

COLONEL BRANDON

Have I been rightly informed? Is it

so?

ELINOR

It is indeed so. Are you acquainted

with Mr Ferrars?

COLONEL BRANDON

No, we have never met. But I know

only too well the cruelty--the

impolitic cruelty of dividing two

young people long attached to one

another. Mrs Ferrars does not know

what she may drive her son to--

COLONEL BRANDON

I have a proposal to make that should

enable him to marry Miss Steele

immediately. Since the gentleman is

so close a friend to your family,

perhaps you will be good enough to

mention it to him?

ELINOR

Colonel, I am sure he would be only

too delighted to hear it from your

own lips.

COLONEL BRANDON

I think not. His behaviour has proved

him proud--in the best sense. I feel

certain this is the right course.

ELINOR

Mr Ferrars.

EDWARD

Miss Dashwood.

ELINOR

Thank you for responding so promptly

to my message.

EDWARD

I was most grateful to receive it. I--

Miss Dashwood, God knows what you

must think of me...

ELINOR

Mr Ferrars--

EDWARD

I have no right to speak, I know--

ELINOR

Mr Ferrars, I have good news. I think

you know of our friend Colonel

Brandon?

EDWARD

Yes, I have heard his name.

ELINOR

Colonel Brandon desires me to say

that, understanding you wish to join

the clergy, he has great pleasure in

offering you the parish on his estate

at Delaford, now just vacant, in the

hope that it may enable you--and

Miss Steele--to marry.

EDWARD

Colonel Brandon?

ELINOR

Yes. He means it as testimony of his

concern for--for the cruel situation

in which you find yourselves.

EDWARD

Colonel Brandon give me a parish?

Can it be possible?

ELINOR

The unkindness of your family has

made you astonished to find friendship

elsewhere.

EDWARD

No. Not to find it in you. I cannot

be ignorant that to you--to your

goodness--I owe it all. I feel it. I

would express it if I could, but, as

you know, I am no orator.

ELINOR

You are very much mistaken. I assure

you that you owe it almost entirely

to your own merit--I have had no

hand in it.

EDWARD

Colonel Brandon must be a man of

great worth and respect ability.

ELINOR

He is the kindest and best of men.

EDWARD

May I enquire why the Colonel did

not tell me himself?

ELINOR

I think he felt it would be better

coming from... a friend.

EDWARD

Your friendship has been the most

important of my life.

ELINOR

You will always have it.

EDWARD

Forgive me.

ELINOR

Mr Ferrars, you honour your promises--

that is more important than anything

else. I wish you--both--very happy.

EDWARD

Goodbye, Miss Dashwood.

CHARLOTTE

What a stroke of luck for Lucy and

Edward to find a parish so close to

Barton! You will all be able to meet

very often. That will cheer you up,

Miss Marianne. I do declare I have

never disliked a person so much as I

do Mr Willoughby, for your sake.

Insufferable man! To think we can

see his insufferable house from the

top of our hill!

CHARLOTTE

I shall ask Jackson to plant some

very tall trees.

MR PALMER

(from behind the paper)

You will do nothing of the sort.

CHARLOTTE (V.O.)

I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown was

everything of the finest--made in

Paris, no less. I should have liked

to see it, although I dare say it

was a sorry affair, scalloped with

ruffles--but what do the French know

about fashion?

CHARLOTTE (V.O.)

I am resolved never to mention Mr

Willoughby's name again, and

furthermore I shall tell everyone I

meet what a good-for nothing he is.

MR PALMER (V.O.)

Be quiet.

ELINOR

(sotto voce)

I do not think she drew breath from

the moment we left London. It is my

fault--I should have found some other

way of getting home.

MARIANNE

There was no other way you said so

yourself.

ELINOR

We shall be home soon enough. Mamma

will comfort you, dearest.

MARIANNE

I am stiff from sitting so long.

Will you tell Charlotte that I am

going for a stroll? ELINOR glances

at the sky in concern.

ELINOR

I think it is going to rain.

MARIANNE

No, no, it will not rain.

ELINOR

You always say that and then it always

does.

MARIANNE

I will keep to the garden, near the

house.

CHARLOTTE

We are very proud of our little

Thomas, Colonel--and his papa has

such a way with him...

CHARLOTTE

There you are, Miss Dashwood! Mr

Palmer and the Colonel have locked

themselves up in the billiard room.

Come and meet little Thomas. Where

is Miss Marianne?

ELINOR

She is taking a little air in the

garden.

CHARLOTTE

Oh, very good. That is the great

advantage of the countryside--all

the fresh air and... and all the

fresh air...

CHARLOTTE

(yelling)

He is the best child in the world--

he never cries unless he wants to

and then, Lord, there is no stopping

him.

ELINOR

I cannot see Marianne.

CHARLOTTE

She has probably taken shelter in

one of the greenhouses!

MARIANNE

Love is not love Which alters when

it alteration finds Or bends with

the remover to remove: 0, no! it is

an ever-fixed mark That looks on

tempests and is never shaken...

COLONEL BRANDON

Marianne!

MARIANNE

Willoughby... Willoughby...

CHARLOTTE

One thing is certain--she will be

wet through when she returns.

MR PALMER

Thank you for pointing that out, my

dear. Do not worry, Miss Dashwood--

Brandon will find her. I think we

can all guess where she went.

COLONEL BRANDON

She is not hurt--but we must get her

warm!

ELINOR

I think Marianne may need a doctor.

CHARLOTTE

You'll wear yourself out, Colonel!

Do not worry! A day or two in bed

will soon set her to rights!

MR PALMER

You can rely upon Harris, Colonel. I

have never found a better physician.

COLONEL BRANDON

(urgent)

What is your diagnosis?

DR HARRIS

It is an infectious fever that has

taken far more serious hold than I

would have expected in one so young.

I would recommend the hasty removal

of your child, Mr Palmer--

CHARLOTTE

Mrs Bunting! Mrs Bunting!

MR PALMER

My dear Miss Dashwood, I am more

sorry than I can say. If you would

prefer me to stay I am at your

service.

ELINOR

Mr Palmer, that is very kind. But

Colonel Brandon and Dr Harris will

look after us. Thank you for

everything you have done.

DR HARRIS

She is not doing as well as I would

like.

COLONEL BRANDON

What can I do?

ELINOR

Colonel, you have done so much

already.

COLONEL BRANDON

Give me an occupation, Miss Dashwood,

or I shall run mad. He is dangerously

quiet.

ELINOR

She would be easier if her mother

were here.

COLONEL BRANDON

Of course. Barton is but eight hours

away. If I make no stop, you may see

us early tomorrow morning.

COLONEL BRANDON

In your hands I know she will be

safe.

DR HARRIS

Double the number of drops and I

will return as soon as I can.

MARIANNE

Who is that?

MARIANNE

Look, look, Elinor.

ELINOR

There is no one there, dearest.

MARIANNE

It is Papa. Papa has come.

MARIANNE

Dearest Papa!

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE:

DR HARRIS

I must fetch more laudanum. I cannot

pretend, Miss Dashwood, that your

sister's condition is not very

serious. You must prepare yourself.

I will return very shortly.

DISSOLVE:

ELINOR

Marianne, Marianne, please try--

ELINOR

Marianne, please try--I cannot--I

cannot do without you. Oh, please, I

have tried to bear everything else--

I will try--but please, dearest,

beloved Marianne, do not leave me

alone.

DISSOLVE:

MARIANNE (V.O.)

Elinor?

ELINOR

My mother!

ELINOR

Mamma! She is out of danger!

MRS DASHWOOD

There, there, my love, my Marianne.

MARIANNE

Where is Elinor?

ELINOR

I am here, dearest, I am here.

MARIANNE

Colonel Brandon.

MARIANNE

Thank you.

COLONEL BRANDON (V.O.)

What though the sea with waves

continuall Doe eate the earth, it is

no more at all.

COLONEL BRANDON

Nor is the earth the lesse, or loseth

aught. For whatsoever from one place

doth fall, Is with the tide unto

another brought...

MRS. DASHWOOD

He certainly is nor so dashing as

Willoughby but he has a far more

pleasing countenance. There was always

a something, if you remember, in

Willoughby's eyes at times which I

did not like.

COLONEL BRANDON

'For there is nothing lost, but may

be found, if sought...

MARIANNE

Shall we continue tomorrow?

COLONEL BRANDON

No--for I must away.

MARIANNE

Away? Where?

COLONEL BRANDON

(teasing)

That I cannot tell you. It is a

secret.

MARIANNE

(impulsive)

But you will not stay away long?

MARIANNE

There.

MARIANNE

There I fell, and there I first saw

Willoughby.

ELINOR

Poor Willoughby. He will always regret

you.

MARIANNE

But does it follow that, had he chosen

me, he would have been content?

MARIANNE

He would have had a wife he loved

but no money--and might soon have

learned to rank the demands of his

pocket-book far above the demands of

his heart.

MARIANNE

If his present regrets are half as

painful as mine, he will suffer

enough.

ELINOR

Do you compare your conduct with

his?

MARIANNE

No. I compare it with what it ought

to have been. I compare it with yours.

ELINOR

Our situations were very different.

MARIANNE

My illness has made me consider the

past. I saw in my own behaviour

nothing but imprudence--and worse. I

was insolent and unjust to everyone--

MARIANNE

--but you--you I wronged above all.

Only I knew your heart and its sorrows

but even then I was never a grain

more compassionate. I brought my

illness upon myself--I wanted to

destroy myself. And had I succeeded,

what misery should I have caused

you?

MARIANNE

I shall mend my ways! I shall no

longer worry others nor torture

myself. I am determined to enter on

a course of serious study---Colonel

Brandon has promised me the run of

his library and I shall read at least

six hours a day. By the end of the

year I expect to have improved my

learning a very great deal.

MARGARET

You'll go blind if you're not careful.

MRS DASHWOOD

Is Thomas back from Exeter, Betsy?

BETSY

Yes, ma'am--he brung back two lovely

fillets for you.

MRS DASHWOOD

Beef is far less expensive in Exeter,

and anyway they are for Marianne.

BETSY

Sixpence a piece, Miss Dashwood. Oh,

and he says Mr Ferrars is married,

but I suppose you know that, ma'am.

MRS DASHWOOD

Fetch Thomas to us, Betsy.

THOMAS

Beg pardon, Miss Dashwood, but they

was the cheapest in the market--

MRS DASHWOOD

It was a very good price, Thomas,

well done. Would you be so kind as

to build up the fire a little?

THOMAS

(relieved)

Yes, ma'am.

MRS DASHWOOD

Who told you that Mr Ferrars was

married, Thomas?

THOMAS

I seen him myself, ma'am, and his

lady too, Miss Lucy Steele as was--

they were stopping in a chaise at

the New London Inn. I happened to

look up as I passed the chaise and I

see it was Miss Steele. So I took

off my hat and she inquired after

you, ma'am, and all the young ladies,

especially Miss Dashwood, and bid me

I should give you her and Mr Ferrars's

best compliments and service and how

they'd be sure to send you a piece

of the cake.

MRS DASHWOOD

Was Mr Ferrars in the carriage with

her?

THOMAS

Yes, ma'am--I just seen him leaning

back in it, but he did not look up.

ELINOR

Did--

MARIANNE

Did Mrs Ferrars seem well?

THOMAS

Yes, Miss Marianne--she said how she

was vastly contented and, since she

was always a very affable young lady,

I made free to wish her joy.

MRS DASHWOOD

Thank you, Thomas.

MRS DASHWOOD

Your father once told me not to allow

you to neglect yourself. Now I find

that it is I who have neglected you

most.

ELINOR

No, Mamma.

MRS DASHWOOD

Yes, I have. We all have. Marianne

is right.

ELINOR

I am very good at hiding.

MRS DASHWOOD

Then we must observe you more closely.

ELINOR

Mamma?

MRS DASHWOOD

Yes, my darling?

ELINOR

There is a painful difference between

the expectation of an unpleasant

event and its final certainty.

MRS DASHWOOD (V.O.)

Marianne! Marianne! Come and see

what is coming!

MRS DASHWOOD

'At last I have found a small enough

instrument to fir the parlour. I

expect to follow it in a day or two,

by which time I expect you to have

learned the enclosed. Your devoted

friend, Christopher Brandon.'

MARGARET

He must like you very much, Marianne.

MARIANNE

It is not just for me! It is for all

of us.

MRS DASHWOOD

Here is Colonel Brandon! Marianne!

ELINOR

I do not think it is the Colonel.

MRS DASHWOOD

It must be. He said he would arrive

today. You must play him the new

song, Marianne.

MARGARET

Edward!

MARGARET

It is Edward!

MRS DASHWOOD

Calm. We must be calm.

BETSY

Mr Ferrars for you, ma'am.

MRS DASHWOOD

(rising)

Edward! What a pleasure to see you.

EDWARD

Mrs Dashwood. Miss Marianne. Margaret.

Miss Dashwood. I hope I find you all

well.

MARIANNE

Thank you, Edward, we are all very

well.

MARGARET

We have been enjoying very fine

weather.

MARGARET

Well, we have.

EDWARD

I am glad of it. The... the roads

were very dry.

MRS DASHWOOD

(giving him her hand)

May I wish you great joy, Edward.

MARIANNE

I hope you have left Mrs Ferrars

well?

EDWARD

Tolerably, thank you.

EDWARD

I--But EDWARD cannot seem to find

any words.

MRS DASHWOOD

Is Mrs Ferrars at the new parish?

EDWARD

No--my mother is in town.

MRS DASHWOOD

I meant to enquire after Mrs Edward

Ferrars.

EDWARD

Then you have not heard--the news--I

think you mean my brother--you mean

Mrs Robert Ferrars.

MRS DASHWOOD

Mrs Robert Ferrars?

EDWARD

Yes. I received a letter from Miss

Steele--or Mrs Ferrars, I should say--

communicating the... the transfer of

her affections to my brother Robert.

They were much thrown together in

London, I believe, and... and in

view of the change in my

circumstances, I felt it only fair

that Miss Steele be released from

our engagement. At any rate, they

were married last week and are now

in Plymouth.

ELINOR

Then you--are not married.

EDWARD

No.

EDWARD

Elinor! I met Lucy when I was very

young. Had I had an active profession,

I should never have felt such an

idle, foolish inclination. At Norland

my behaviour was very wrong. But I

convinced myself you felt only

friendship for me and it was my heart

alone that I was risking. I have

come with no expectations. Only to

profess, now that I am at liberty to

do so, that my heart is and always

will be yours.

MARGARET

He's sitting next to her!

MRS DASHWOOD/MARIANNE

Margaret, come down!/Is he?

MRS DASHWOOD

(scolding)

Margaret! Will you stop--

MARIANNE

What's happening now?

MRS DASHWOOD

Marianne!

MARGARET (V.O.)

He's kneeling down!

MRS DASHWOOD

Oh! Is he? Oh!

ELINOR

Your mother, I suppose, will hardly

be less angry with Robert for marrying

Lucy.

EDWARD

The more so since she settled the

money upon him so irrevocably--

ELINOR

--no doubt because she had run out

of sons to disinherit.

EDWARD

Her family fluctuates at an alarming

rate. Then, in London, when you told

me of the Colonel's offer, I became

convinced that you wanted me to marry

Lucy and that--well, that you and

Colonel Brandon...

ELINOR

Me and Colonel Brandon!

EDWARD

I shall not forget attempting to

thank him for making it possible for

me to marry the woman I did not love

while convinced he had designs upon

the woman I did--do--love.

EDWARD

Would you--can you--excuse me--

THE END
