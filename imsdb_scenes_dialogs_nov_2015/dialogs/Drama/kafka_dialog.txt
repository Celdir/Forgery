BURGEL

Kafka.

BURGEL

The keeper of the files is still

waiting for your final summation

of the Erlanger claim.

KAFKA

I gave it to him yesterday.

BURGEL

(doesn't understand)

You didn't give it to

me

.

KAFKA

No, I left it in his office.

BURGEL

Did you see him?

KAFKA

I've never seen him.  I don't

believe there is a keeper of the

files.

BURGEL

He's usually in the storage room

sorting things out.  He can't

close the file on a case until he

has the concluding report.

KAFKA

He has it, he just hasn't noticed

it yet, all right?

BURGEL

Who's to say he ever will?  He's

a timid old man and quite careful

not to tread on anyone's toes --

In fact, I'm the only one he trusts

and he wouldn't even look at a

document if it didn't first come

through me.

BURGEL

In an organization as efficient as

ours, if a document once in a great

while gets lost it might never be

found at all.

KAFKA

(tiring of this)

Burgel, I thought it would be

easier, as long as I was passing --

BURGEL

But

I'm

the messenger.  An error

like this damages my credibility.

KAFKA

Your credibility -- yes, it's well

known.

BURGEL

(flushed)

When I deliver a message the very

act of delivering it, you might say,

gives it an official stamp, and only

in this way are both the sender and

the receiver satisfied that it was

delivered at all.

KAFKA

I'll commit that to memory.

BURGEL

Your position in this firm is not

unassailable.

CUT:

BIZARRE VOICE

Yes?

KAFKA

I'm sorry to disturb you -- I

wonder if you know where my

friend Eduard is?

BIZARRE VOICE

I can't hear you! -- You'd better

come in.

KAFKA

-- I didn't want to bother you.

CONCIERGE

Well, you have.  What do you

want?

KAFKA

(pointing upstairs)

My friend Eduard, I wonder if you've

seen him?  He hasn't been in to

work, I thought he might be ill.

CUT:

KAFKA

You didn't have to get out of

bed -- I could have taken the key.

CONCIERGE

Yes, I'm sure you could.

KAFKA

Well, he's not here.

KAFKA

Do you think you ought to do

that?

CONCIERGE

The manners of a tramp!  It's my

house, isn't it?

CUT:

KAFKA

Miss Rossmann?

KAFKA

I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in

Accident --

GABRIELA

I know.

KAFKA

You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.

GABRIELA

Why would you suppose so?

KAFKA

Oh -- well, I thought he once

mentioned --

GABRIELA

(shuts file cabinet)

One of you must be mistaken.

KAFKA

I'm sorry, but I just wondered --

GABRIELA

(brushing past him)

Excuse me, I have to copy this for

Central Docketing by 2:30.

BURGEL

You're late -- I knew it would

happen one day.

mentioned -- then sees the two men

CUT:

MARGARETE

-- This is our friend Anna who

works with us on the magazine.

KAFKA

Hello.

ANNA

I've been hearing all about you.

ERNST

Don't worry, Kafka -- I championed

your virtues.

KAFKA

I'd like to hear them.

JULIUS

Anna's new to the city -- we

wouldn't frighten her needlessly.

KAFKA

I've lived all my life in this city

-- it frightens me.  As it draws me

closer into its web.

STELLA

-- This is an ancient lament.

KAFKA

No, but do you realize why? -- it

has no

present

.

ANNA

-- I'm hoping to live in the Old

Quarter.

KAFKA

Even the so-called New Town isn't

so new.  Only the people.  People

of the future living in buildings

of the past.

(abruptly)

Has anyone seen Eduard?

MARGARETE

Who?

My friend Eduard from the office --

I've brought him here lots of times

-- you used to marvel at his travel

stories.

JULIUS

Oh, him.

KAFKA

What d'you mean, oh him?  He's

a perfectly nice person, he's never

missed a day before.

ERNST

Perhaps he's taken up with those

traveling players you two were

so fond of.

KAFKA

No, it's me who always wanted to

run away with them -- except that

that life would be far too hectic

for me.  I'm worried about him, no

one's seen him.

STELLA

Haven't you ever called in sick

and gone roaming about, free of

responsibility to anyone, if only

for a day?

KAFKA

When you work for a medical firm

you can't call in sick.  They know

malingerers like a dog knows fleas.

ANNA

You work in the insurance department?

KAFKA

You have been hearing the sordid

side then.

MARGARETE

Be pleased -- you constantly inspire

people to take an interest in your

life.

ANNA

I should think it's very interesting

work.

KAFKA

My father always said I had

no ambition.

CUT:

STELLA

The cabaret will be packed this

time of night -- we'll never get in.

JULIUS

Well, it has to be the cabaret

because there's nowhere else to go.

MARGARET

Home, I think.

JULIUS

Home

?

MARGARET

(head on Ernst's shoulder)

You know I can't stay up late.

VOICE

Home is the last resort --

ERNST

(introducing him)

-- Do you know Bizzlebek --

the gravedigger?

BIZZLEBEK

Stonecutter

, if you please.

MARGARETE

Sculptor

, if only he'd admit it.

BIZZLEBEK

No one should admit being an artist

unless they're paid for it.  If

you go to the cabaret mention my

name -- they'll find a table for you.

ERNST

Bizzlebek has ways and means denied

lesser mortals.  It comes from working

in the cemetery all day -- he's able

to transcent the physical world.

BIZZLEBEK

No -- it only makes me view people

dispassionately as so many ... slabs.

BIZZLEBEK

Quartz ... slate ... gravel ...

granite ... flint ...

(and then)

Marble.

JULIUS

My God, look, he's marching forward

willingly to make human contact.

GABRIELA

(as Kafka comes over)

Hello again.

KAFKA

I've never seen you here before.

GABRIELA

Have you looked?

KAFKA

Well -- nice to know life exists

outside the office.

GABRIELA

(ironic)

Yes.

CUT:

KAFKA

No, really, I have to go home too.

MARGARETE

We're keeping him from his true

vocation.

JULIUS

I know, he

consists

of writing.

We wouldn't be his friends if we

didn't threaten his solitude!

ANNA

Where do you live?

KAFKA

Up there.

ANNA

I tried finding a place on Castle

Hill when I arrived.  I wanted to

share the majesty.

KAFKA

It's only majestic from here.

When you get closer you see it

for what it really is.

ANNA

What is it really?

KAFKA

A glorified office block.  They

keep all the old records there --

the final resting place for facts

and figures that have ceased to

matter in the world of the living.

ANNA

Well, as long as I admire it from

afar it shouldn't worry me if it's

hollow.

tempts

him -- but would suffocate

KAFKA

It's more than hollow.  It's

stillborn.  For all its size it

serves no purpose.  It's just

there -- like death -- hovering

over a breathing city.

MARGARETE

Don't worry about your friend --

I'm sure he'll turn up.

ERNST

(a parting word)

What are you working on, Kafka?

KAFKA

I'm writing a story about a man

who wakes up one morning to find

himself transformed into a giant

insect.

BIZZLEBEK

I've read your stories.  They're

fantastic.

KAFKA

(not sure if he

believes him)

I don't know what you could have

read.

BIZZLEBEK

Just what you've published.

KAFKA

-- In magazines nobody reads.

BIZZLEBEK

I read the one about the penal

colony.

KAFKA

(cautious)

Did you?

BIZZLEBEK

The needles inscribing the

judgement into the flesh of the

man.

(looks impressed)

Very good.

BIZZLEBEK

If I could sculpt as well as that,

I'd be quite proud of myself.

KAFKA

"As Gregor Samsa awoke one

morning from disturbing dreams

he ... from unsettling dreams ...

uneasy dreams ... Gregor Samsa ...

Gregor ...?"

(wondering)

Carl.  George.  Rudolf ...

CUT:

SECOND MAN

(still behind Kafka

at the door)

You know him?

KAFKA

... Yes.

FIRST MAN

His name is Eduard Raban?

KAFKA

... Yes.

MAN

(with an introductory

nod)

Inspector Grubach.

CUT:

INSPECTOR

Kafka -- is that your real name?

KAFKA

Yes.  Yes, of course -- why

wouldn't it be?

INSPECTOR

When was the last time you saw

Mr. Raban?

KAFKA

Wednesday.  We left the office

together.

INSPECTOR

Did you go anywhere afterwards --

to have a drink perhaps?

KAFKA

No, we said goodbye outside the

building.  He went off, as usual,

toward his house.

INSPECTOR

(consulting papers)

Your office is the Workmen's --

KAFKA

-- Accident and Compensation

Association.

INSPECTOR

Where you've been employed for

seven years.

KAFKA

Eight -- and seven months.

INSPECTOR

Engaged in the manufacture and

distribution of ... pills and so

forth.

KAFKA

Well -- other departments are, yes.

INSPECTOR

Would you describe your relationship

with the dead man as close?

KAFKA

Yes.  Since he came to the office,

almost three years ago, we've

been quite good friends.

(pause)

How was Eduard ...

INSPECTOR

He was found in the River.  Could

he swim?

KAFKA

I don't know.

INSPECTOR

Was he depressed?

KAFKA

No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do

you think he drowned himself?

INSPECTOR

Grown men don't normally fall

into the river, do they?

KAFKA

No, I suppose not.

INSPECTOR

(closing the file)

He might have had a drink or two,

despite what you think.

KAFKA

(as the interview

seems to be over)

Can I ask -- how you found me?

INSPECTOR

His landlady knew of no other

friends to refer us to.

KAFKA

I don't think he really had any.

He had no family either.

INSPECTOR

We know that.

KAFKA

He wasn't a lonely man, though.

INSPECTOR

What makes you think so?

KAFKA

... Just a perception.

CUT:

INSPECTOR

I don't usually involve myself

with you people in the Old Quarter

-- but the River runs its own course.

It won't be the last time it

deposits its unwanted debris on my

doorstep.

KAFKA

Probably not.

INSPECTOR

Anyway, I'd like you to reflect

that in me you have -- I won't say

a friend, because we're complete

fencers, of course -- from

distinctly incompatible social

classes -- but to some extent, shall

we say, an interested third party.

KAFKA

I'll bear that in mind.

INSPECTOR

(hands Kafka his card)

-- Should you happen upon anything

that might be relevant.

CUT:

KAFKA

You wanted to see me, sir.

CHIEF CLERK

(indicates a chair)

Sit down, Kafka.

CHIEF CLERK

You've been with the firm for

nearly nine years.  You've done

your work diligently, there are no

complaints on that score.  But

there's more to the job than the

work -- there are other people to

consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we

eel your social situation could

bear improving.

KAFKA

... My ... social situation?

CHIEF CLERK

You keep too much to yourself --

you're a lone wolf.  It makes me

uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy

I can't imagine the impression you

make on lesser employees.

KAFKA

To do my work well, I have little

time for --

CHIEF CLERK

You must make the time.  Where

do you go off to in the lunch

hour?

KAFKA

I usually take lunch by the River.

CHIEF CLERK

It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for

you and not for your workmates.  At

the annual dinner this month you

again failed to make an appearance.

KAFKA

I did not realize it was obligatory.

CHIEF CLERK

Have you never wondered -- and I

mention this only in passing --

(as he paces past and

Kafka turns his head)

why other clerks have advanced to

more responsible positions while you,

who have been here longer, have not?

KAFKA

No, sir.

CHIEF CLERK

Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter

how well you do your work -- you

still see it as something to be

gotten on with rather than something

to take an active interest in.

KAFKA

(leans forward in

rebuttal)

Well, I --

CHIEF CLERK

(keeps pacing)

Oh, I know you got along with that

poor fellow -- what was his name?

KAFKA

-- Eduard --

CHIEF CLERK

-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too

much like you -- even more so

perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as

you, so I didn't know him as well --

but I could see the influence he was

having.  I simply want you to be

aware of this because you'll be

happier for it.

CHIEF CLERK

In any case -- don't ask me why --

the word has come down you're to

be promoted.

CHIEF CLERK

Your colleague's death has helped

precipitate the need, though I can

tell you it's been under

consideration for some time.  You're

to be given two assistants and a

commensurate rise in salary.

(sits back behind

desk)

That's all.

CHIEF CLERK

Kafka.

CHIEF CLERK

I understand you fancy yourself an

author.

KAFKA

(almost visibly

cringes)

In a small way.

CHIEF CLERK

You might find a more athletic

hobby -- put some color in your

cheeks.

BURGEL

Good morning --

(she ignores him)

Or should I say good afternoon?

GABRIELA

Say what you like -- no one pays

the least attention.

BURGEL

(walking quickly

alongside her)

Oh, don't they?  I think you

underestimate my station in this

office and overrate your own.

GABRIELA

Not today, Burgel.  Send one of

your memos, write up one of your

communiques, but for God's sake

don't bother me today.

BURGEL

It's my place to offer advice, not

yours -- and by advising the Chief

Clerk of your unpunctuality it's

certainly not my situation that's

compromised, if that's what you're

implying.

GABRIELA

(stops to glare at

him)

You're just doing your job.

BURGEL

It's what I'm paid to do.

GABRIELA

You're detestable.

BURGEL

And you're late!

CUT:

KAFKA

My assistants, I presume.

ASSISTANTS

Yes -- that's us.

KAFKA

(offers his hand)

I'm Kafka.

LUDWIG

(shaking hands)

Ludwig.

OSKAR

(now it's his turn)

Oskar.

KAFKA

You look like brothers.

ASSISTANTS

Yes -- we do.

KAFKA

Have you worked here long?

ASSISTANTS

No, no, no -- quite a long time,

yes.

KAFKA

Well, we'd better move things

from my old desk.

CUT:

GABRIELA

Eduard and I had lunch together

one day ... and you saw us.

KAFKA

On the Embankment.

CUT:

GABRIELA

I was having an affair with

Eduard.

(notes Kafka's reaction)

He didn't tell you?

KAFKA

No.

GABRIELA

He would have.  You were his best

friend.  A better friend than me.

KAFKA

I suspected that he -- well.

GABRIELA

What?

KAFKA

That he was -- satisfied in that

regard.  I didn't want to pry.

GABRIELA

(throws her hair

back proudly)

It's not that we wanted to deceive

anyone -- but you know how these

things are looked upon at the office.

GABRIELA

What's funny?

KAFKA

This morning it was suggested to

me that my own sense of office

fellowship could bear improving.

GABRIELA

As long as it's on their terms.

If your work and your private

life don't correspond to their

specifications you're labelled a

dangerous agitator -- with no

recourse whatsoever.

KAFKA

How long were you and Eduard --

GABRIELA

Two or three months, that's all.

(adds)

-- I seduced him.

GABRIELA

You know as well as I do that he

didn't commit suicide.

KAFKA

No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone

is able to bear life with any

assurance at all.

GABRIELA

Eduard didn't see it as something

that needed bearing.

KAFKA

The police would know the

difference, wouldn't they?

GABRIELA

Do you think people in the New

Town care what happens over here?

(nodding across the

water)

This will always be the ghetto.

KAFKA

He wasn't robbed.  He was

identified by his wallet.

GABRIELA

And you believe everything the

authorities tell you.

KAFKA

When I have no reason to doubt.

GABRIELA

The very fact that they're

authorities should give you reason.

People will do anything to protect

their own interests.  For all you

know he was killed at the

hands

of

the police.

KAFKA

-- What could he have done to

warrant that?

GABRIELA

Are you free tonight?

KAFKA

Tonight?

GABRIELA

There are some people I'd like you

to meet.  Can you come to the

Musil district at eight o'clock?

KAFKA

... All right.

GABRIELA

You almost married recently,

didn't you?

KAFKA

Last year.  I -- it was broken

off.

GABRIELA

Eduard wanted to marry me.

KAFKA

And you ...?

GABRIELA

I'm suspicious of men who want

to marry.  I believe they think

it's the only thing that will

make them equal to their fathers.

KAFKA

(then follows

behind her)

-- I don't know the Musil

district.

GABRIELA

(without turning)

You won't have any trouble finding

it.

CUT:

MAN IN BLACK

(hoarse voice)

Long live anarchy!

CUT:

VOICE FROM BEHIND

Please sit down.

BEARDED ANARCHIST

We'll save the introductions.

(takes his seat)

We don't know yet if you're friend

or foe.

KAFKA

Strangers make better foes than

friends.  Will you tell me who you

are altogether, if not individually?

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

Heralds of a new age -- does that

sound immodest?

BEARDED ANARCHIST

You could say we represent the

un

official view of a well-ordered

society.

KAFKA

(to Gabriela)

Ah -- we're back to the "authorities"

you spoke of.

GABRIELA

They're ubiquitous.  What we try to

do ... is make them a little less so.

BEARDED ANARCHIST

Quite a disturbance tonight, yes?

And perhaps you recall last month --

the explosion at the Municipal

Courthouse that sent one of the

examining magistrates to join the

heavenly choir.

KAFKA

(disbelieving)

... Was Eduard one of you?

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST

The last to join us, the first to

leave us.

KAFKA

... Why take me into your confidence?

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

That's obvious, isn't it?  We

have an opening for a new member.

GABRIELA

I nominated you as a possible

candidate.  You were Eduard's good

friend.  He read me some of your

work.

KAFKA

I've hardly published enough for

anyone to draw conclusions from.

GABRIELA

You strike me as a man with a

defined notion of injustice -- a

high concern for the lot of your

fellow men.  And yet you're able to

remain an outsider.  With the

concomitant air of ... superiority?

BEARDED ANARCHIST

In short, a higher man.  It's what

we want.  It's what we need.

KAFKA

The distance to my fellow man is

for me quite a journey.  As for

being an outsider, it's never been

a matter of choice.

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST

(as Kafka starts to

leave)

-- They may have instituted proceedings

against you.

KAFKA

(turns)

What proceedings?

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

Preliminary investigations may already

be underway.

BEARDED ANARCHIST

You were his friend.  One link is

all they need.

GABRIELA

The day he died, Eduard was called

up to the Castle.  Did you know that?

KAFKA

(shakes his head)

What of it?

GABRIELA

He was summoned to help correct a

minor discrepancy of some sort in

the Medical Records Division.

Apparently one of his claims was

relevant.

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

-- Merely in the interests of order,

you understand.  The officials at

the Castle like to cover their tracks.

GABRIELA

He was never seen alive again.

KAFKA

And you still maintain -- what?

That he was murdered.

GABRIELA

He was murdered.

BEARDED ANARCHIST

As you can imagine, a pass into

the Castle -- hardly ever granted --

was an opportunity we couldn't

ignore.

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST

The Castle represents every

anachronism that needs to be destroyed

if progress is to be made.

BEARDED ANARCHIST

As you know, it's not the most

accessible location.  Far from being

depressed, Eduard was particularly

excited when he brought us the news

of this chance invitation. He set off

that evening carrying one of our

custom-made briefcases instead of

his own.

GABRIELA

(gauging Kafka's reaction)

You're shocked at the thought of

Eduard tossing a bomb through a

window.

KAFKA

I have no right to be, I know.  My

experience with real life  is

practically nil.

GABRIELA

When you only see someone sitting at

a desk all day, it's liable to

create a false impression.

KAFKA

People must think the same of me --

a quiet, dependable person.

BEARDED ANARCHIST

You don't have to accept everything

as true, my friend.  You need only

accept it as necessary.

GABRIELA

As the bomb never went off, we can

only assume he was caught with it --

and summarily executed.

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

-- Merely in the interests of order.

BEARDED ANARCHIST

The formality of a trial would be too

costly for them.  They're beginning

to understand that it's the ensuing

news of our actions that incites

support.

KAFKA

Propaganda of the dead?

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST

The Castle will deny he was there

any longer than his business required.

They're just file clerks up there.  No

doubt he was handed over to the police

with the utmost discretion.

BEARDED ANARCHIST

In any event, we've felt no

repercussions as yet.  Eduard must not

have talked.  You're the one they

contacted.

KAFKA

So that's who my foes are -- policemen

and file clerks.  Law and order, you

might say.

GABRIELA

You think what we're doing is so

wrong?  And what are you doing?

Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To

answer to some supreme tribunal?

KAFKA

My only concern is the human

tribunal.  Isn't it yours?

GABRIELA

Yes -- which is why "quiet,

dependable people" have to take

charge of their own lives.

KAFKA

At the cost of others?  You accuse

people of murder without trial --

apparently without irony.  Did you

go to the Castle with Eduard?

(apparently not)

Then you have no idea what really

might have happened that night at

all -- even before or after he got

there.

GABRIELA

Your human tribunal will betray

you.  Just as its members will be

betrayed when they find no supreme

one

GABRIELA

Join us, Kafka.

GABRIELA

It's sheer folly for anyone to

try to pull through alone.

CUT:

KAFKA

How was your evening?

ASSISTANTS

Fine -- terrible.

KAFKA

(uncovering his

typewriter)

What was the matter with it?

OSKAR

(indicating Ludwig)

He can't sit still.  Just when we

arrive at a nightclub he wants to

go to another one.

LUDWIG

(to Kafka)

You look tired.

OSKAR

(interrupting)

Gabriela Rossman was here looking

for you.  Do you know her?

KAFKA

(looking up)

Do you?

OSKAR

We saw her naked once -- didn't we.

LUDWIG

Women are all you have on your

mind!

OSKAR

She went to the roof to sunbathe

one lunch hour -- we watched her

changing.

KAFKA

I didn't realize you'd been here

that long.

OSKAR

You mean because it's been a while

since there was a sunny day?  What

a good detective you are.

LUDWIG

They keep switching us from

department to department.  He

doesn't mind because he can't sit

still.

OSKAR

We used to be in the supply section,

carrying boxes of medicine about

but we dropped too many of them.

LUDWIG

It's not too bad working here.

KAFKA

You don't think it's a horrible

double life from which there is

probably no escape but insanity?

LUDWIG

No.

KAFKA

I'm glad for you.

OSKAR

(calling after him)

You should be content, you know!

CUT:

BURGEL

Are you looking for Gabriela

Rossmann?

KAFKA

Yes.

CUT:

GABRIELA

(hardly glancing at

him)

I'm collecting Eduard's things.

If there's anything you want, take

it or I'll give it to charity.

KAFKA

(taking her note

from his pocket)

Burgel gave me this -- what does

it mean?

GABRIELA

(now looks up)

Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with

him.

KAFKA

(going closer)

Why were you given notice?

GABRIELA

They're not obliged to tell.

KAFKA

It couldn't be for that incident

with Burgel the other day.

GABRIELA

Of course it could -- Burgel's

been trying to get me thrown out

as long as I can remember.

He

could've killed Eduard.

KAFKA

You don't believe that.

GABRIELA

I wouldn't put it past him.

KAFKA

It seems I knew Eduard a little

bit, after all.

CONCIERGE

Lodgers!  Not one of them thinks

to spare me such spectacles!

GABRIELA

You might think -- I thought so

myself at first -- that Burgel's

too insignificant to be dangerous.

But that's the very reason to beware!

It's the small men to watch out for

-- the ones who substitute method

for character.

KAFKA

(sighs at her

relentlessness)

Now you've fallen into his trap.

When he goes to bed at night

Burgel dreams of inspiring as much

fear in others as they inspire in

him.

GABRIELA

It's still easier for you to

understand suicide, isn't it.

KAFKA

That street down there -- I

always used to call it the approach

road for suicides.  It leads

straight down to the bridge and

the River.

GABRIELA

Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm

sure he knew about us -- and I'm

sure it drove him mad.

KAFKA

Burgel doesn't like anybody!

GABRIELA

He used to like me -- very much

more than I liked him.

KAFKA

He's jealous, yes, but

that

jealous?  He's too cautious.

GABRIELA

Of course he is -- the Castle

precincts are not the safest part

of the city after dark.  People

disappear up there regularly.   If

you want to lie in wait for someone,

that's the place to do it.

KAFKA

Now you're saying Eduard was lured

there?

GABRIELA

(puts away the last

few books)

How often does one of our clerks

have business in the house of records?

KAFKA

I've heard of it happening.

GABRIELA

And Burgel is the bringer of

messages, isn't he?

KAFKA

Usually.

GABRIELA

Or what if there really

was

an

error? -- I don't know what kind --

any kind that needed correcting --

and what if Burgel was responsible

for it?  One mistake -- even a small

one in a firm like ours -- it could

cost him a promotion.

KAFKA

First these nameless authorities

were the root of all evil, now it's

insignificant Burgel.  If indeed

there was a mistake -- and a minor

one at that -- you're suggesting

someone went to a lot of trouble

over something so trivial as to

not matter at all.

GABRIELA

What seems important to these

people is not determined by the

amount of work it entails -- you're

far from understanding the

authorities if you believe that.

KAFKA

Now Burgel's one of the authorities?

GABRIELA

For all his big talk he is.  Does

he really have access to the Directors

of the firm as he always claims?  --

or only the Deputy Managers -- people

of no importance whatsoever.  Someone

ought to follow

him

for a change.

KAFKA

You won't make any sense of it

while you're upset.

GABRIELA

Burgel is only there for one

purpose -- to spy on the employees

and report any and all indiscretions,

real or imagined.  If he didn't

send Eduard to the Castle, you can

be damn sure he's in league with

whoever greeted him there.

(very upset now)

All those bastards are in league

with each other -- why can't you

see that!

KAFKA

... I don't see anything.  I see

a message on its way to me -- with

all the right answers.  Only it

never arrives -- it's always just

on its way.

GABRIELA

Eduard ...

GABRIELA

Your ignorance of the way things

are here is so appalling that it

makes my head spin to listen to

you and compare what you say and

have in mind with the real situation!

CUT:

INSPECTOR

You said she was extremely upset.

People who are extremely upset --

Kafka -- are given to disappearing

in a hurry.  They go and calm down

for a day or so and then they come

back.

KAFKA

But that's just my point -- she was

more than upset, she was livid.

She slammed every door on her way

downstairs -- except that one.

(points at front door)

I was just behind her and I didn't

even hear that one

shut

-- not at

all.

INSPECTOR

That's not what I call conclusive

evidence of an abduction.

KAFKA

If someone was waiting here in the

hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't

they have shut the door as quietly

as possible?

CUT:

INSPECTOR

Why would someone want to kidnap

this woman -- the name is Rossmann?

KAFKA

You told me to contact you if

anything relevant came up --

Gabriela is relevant.  When I

spoke to you before I didn't know

she'd been seeing Eduard.

INSPECTOR

That's been noted.  But where

does it lead us?  Unless you have

something more to add.

KAFKA

She's missing.  I went to her house

and she hadn't returned there.

INSPECTOR

She lost her job today.  Just

between you and me, I'd probably

go away and brood a bit myself.

KAFKA

(manages to blurt out)

Maybe it's true then what she said.

INSPECTOR

(pauses)

What did she say?

KAFKA

That the police may have allegiance

to something other than truth.

KAFKA

-- She didn't think Eduard

committed suicide.

(then)

Any more than I do.

(then)

She was convinced of it.

INSPECTOR

I'm going to say something, and

I hope it's quite clear because

I won't be repeating it.

INSPECTOR

We don't have to hunt for criminals.

We're drawn towards them.  The

guilty show us the way.

CUT:

BIZZLEBEK

Where are your friends?

KAFKA

Good question.

Who

are my friends ...

would also be of interest.

CUT:

KAFKA

(staring into steaming

coffee cup)

Gabriela was right -- it's

easier for me to understand suicide.

I'm a practicing suicide.

BIZZLEBEK

(slightly mocking

as ever)

-- In what sense?

KAFKA

Bachelorhood is just the slow

form.  The bachelor doesn't sew

seeds.  Only the moment matters.

The space he occupies grows

smaller and smaller -- until the

only space right for him is his

coffin.

BIZZLEBEK

These strange stories you write --

they come naturally, do they?

KAFKA

Naturally? -- that's not the word

I would have chosen.

BIZZLEBEK

(seriously)

Where do you get your ideas?

(quickly)

Only joking -- I'm just joking.

(laughing)

Let's go to a brothel then,

Kafka, come on.

KAFKA

I haven't got the energy.  I

mean, I have to conserve my energy.

BIZZLEBEK

Why do you work in that hideous

insurance office?  -- dealing with

people who fall off ladders.  Now

take me -- I make my living as a

stone mason.  It's not my art --

but it's the

tools

of my art.  You

could be -- a journalist.

KAFKA

That would be even worse -- it would

be a compromise.

BIZZLEBEK

Success or nothing?

KAFKA

No -- not even success.  My writing

is not for making a living -- it's

for living.  Not for other people,

it's for me.

KAFKA

... I'm the exile.  Gabriela was

right about that too.

CUT:

BEARDED ANARCHIST

We have another theory.

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

We may have attached too little

importance to the reason Eduard

was summoned to the Castle to begin

with.

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST

-- To correct a small discrepancy,

you may recall.

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

-- Ah, but what if it

wasn't

?

BEARDED ANARCHIST

-- Small.

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST

-- What if it was a

large

discrepancy?

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

Yours is a very powerful and important

firm -- it has a lot at stake.

BEARDED ANARCHIST

Perhaps Eduard was closer than he

knew to discovering it and so had to

be silenced.

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST

-- Or he was even more an innocent

victim than that -- he was

chosen

to

bear the blame if the crime was

uncovered by anyone else.

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

-- The crime so scandalous that the

poor young clerk committed suicide

rather than own up to it.

KAFKA

That's

mad

.

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

-- Oh, yes, it's mad.

KAFKA

-- You said so yourself the firm

is large and powerful.  If the

discrepancy really was something

big, Eduard's responsibility would

still have to be small.  No poor

young

clerk

could find himself in

such a fix.

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

(sarcastic grunt)

When a scapegoat is needed, my

friend ...

BEARDED ANARCHIST

We have to know what he was working

on at the time of his death.

KAFKA

He worked on routine claims.  His

visit to the Castle was probably as

minor a mission as he said it was.

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

Why are you so aggressively

unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer

the only casualty.

KAFKA

Then why haven't I been --

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST

-- Kidnapped or murdered?  Because

your

connection with Eduard was

obvious

and above board -- not as

easily misconstrued.

BEARDED ANARCHIST

-- Not secretive, therefore not

suspicious.

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had

made an enemy of this man Burgel.

KAFKA

(head turning, exasperated)

Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an

affair with Eduard.  They were both

members of

this group

.  If any

crime's been discovered and people

are paying for it, I'd look to

yourselves

!

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST

The loyal civil servant.  I suppose

you'll deny that shortchanging the

workers to whom compensation is due

is standard company policy.

BEARDED ANARCHIST

It wouldn't surprise us if the

discrepancy was between medicines

sent and medicines received.

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST

-- People die for such discrepancies.

KAFKA

He's the clerk who died last week.

From the insurance department

KAFKA

(follows anxiously)

What's the matter?

KEEPER

Why would we keep files on

dead

employees?  All old files are sent

up to the Castle.  Do you think we

have room for two hundred years worth

personnel records?

KAFKA

(dodges another

paper landslide)

It's gone out so quickly?

KEEPER

Whenever an employee departs, shall

we say, it's up to the head of his

department to requisition his file,

reassign any outstanding claims,

and send it off.

KAFKA

-- You mean my Chief has it.

CUT:

KAFKA

Excuse me, sir -- I understand

you have Eduard Raban's file.

CHIEF CLERK

I do.

KAFKA

I wonder if I might look to see

if there's an address for family

-- I thought I'd like to write

to them.

CHIEF CLERK

No -- just as I thought -- no

entry for family.

CHIEF CLERK

Was there something else?

KAFKA

No -- I just -- I feel a sense of

obligation.  He was my friend --

if I can be of any help -- closing

his affairs.

CHIEF CLERK

(putting file away

again)

No, there's only one report to

complete.  I'll be doing it myself

and submitting it to the Castle

today or tomorrow.

KAFKA

(as ingenuously as

possible)

I see -- it's just the Erlanger

claim then.

Orlac

claim.

KAFKA

Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you,

sir.

CHIEF CLERK

Kafka.

CHIEF CLERK

You're too sensitive.  Let your

friend rest in peace.

I've known suicides.  Such a song-

and-dance about nothing.

KAFKA

Yes, sir.

CHIEF CLERK

Give it up.

CUT:

KEEPER

If it was Accounts you wanted

why did you ask for Employees?

KAFKA

Orlac is an account?

KEEPER

It's a factory in the northern

mountains.  One of our best

customers.

(as they disappear

around a corner)

Without a proper request I'm not

obliged to do this, you understand

-- but I'll make an exception on

this one occasion.

KEEPER

At least the account is current

even if the employee isn't.

KEEPER

(coming down ladder)

That place has so many accidents,

it's a good thing the type of

peasants who live up there don't

seem to have any trouble propagating

their race.

KAFKA

(leafing through pages)

All these in the last year?

KEEPER

You must have read about it in the

papers -- there was a terrible

cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so

bad, but even the Medical Officer

for the district was killed!

KAFKA

I did read that.  They gave him

a posthumous medal.

KEEPER

(nods)

Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men.

He spent an entire career in those

backwaters with no regard for

personal gain.  A great loss.

KAFKA

(a particular document)

This is the cross-reference of

clerks who've worked on Orlac

claims?

KEEPER

(nods)

Is your friend's name among

them?

(Kafka shakes his

head)

Then he only worked on the one

case.

(taking file back

again)

Your Chief will send me the final

summation when he's finished with

it.

KAFKA

Once a file's been sent to the

Caste, is it possible to recall

it for review?

KEEPER

(going back up

ladder)

Of course not.  Only by a Director

of the firm.  Who'd want to let in

all kinds of riff-raff off the

streets?

KAFKA

What good are records if they're

not open for public inspection?

KEEPER

(stuffing file back

in place)

These laws have been with us for

centuries -- how can you doubt

them?

KAFKA

What if I petitioned one of the

Directors?

KEEPER

(coming back down)

You do not summon them -- they

summon you -- and this, of course,

hardly ever happens, if at all.

The Directors are an eccentric lot

and by nature cautious.

KAFKA

Where do our records go to in the

Castle?

KEEPER

(starting to walk

away)

We're a medical firm, aren't we?

They go to the Medical Records

Section.

KAFKA

I could always apply there.

KAFKA

I don't want any favors from

We answer directly to Ekman, the

Senior Partner -- he practically

runs the Castle.  In a case like

this you're better off dealing with

the highest authority -- even

though it's equally futile.

Close only by virtue of antithesis.

It's all right to be sarcastic in

private to us -- because we have a

sense of humor -- but when we're up

at the Castle we suggest you don't

make a fuss.  It would spoil the

not unfavorable impression you make

in other respects.

LUDWIG

Frankly, we don't understand why

you've even bothered pursuing this

business.

KAFKA

It would be more accurate to say

that it has pursued me.

But your goal is so hard to reach.

Do you think the official network

would surrender to one man?  We

would never think of attempting

What it amounts to is simply this ...

MURNAU

A piece of paper was delivered to

Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only

Through a very unfortunate -- and

I might add extremely rare --

uses too -- that's why speed is

essential.  Living tissue, even

if its owner has passed on, is

our most valuable acquisition.

MURNAU

We've tried transfusions on

our ... volunteers.  Unfortunately,

far from infusing superior

characteristics it's tended to

make them insane -- murderous

even -- a condition we've had

occasion to make use of.

MURNAU

-- And the new patients they

bring me aren't usually as

dexterous as you've been in

evading us.  Not perfect

specimens by any means, but

not the type of person who'll

be missed either.

KAFKA

What have you done with

Gabriela Rossmann?

MURNAU

As a matter of fact you've

caught us in a state of

considerable excitement.  Our

latest preparation we believe

-- we pray -- is perfected.

It should take years off her.

MURNAU

And if not -- well, there are

always what I call my caprices

of vivisection.

MURNAU

Actually, if it weren't for

the aberrant dilemma posed by

someone like yourself --

continually asking for out-of-date

files -- I'd probably give up my

revisionist policies altogether.

I'm sure what we have to do is

start instead at the very

inception -- with the embryo --

from a single cell even.

(leers at Kafka)

The lure of the Golem -- the

man-made man.  You appreciate

that, I know.

MURNAU

To corrupt the image of man

and then offer redemption ... This

is the dawn, Kafka.  A new man is

being born here.  A more resilient

man ... A superman.

MURNAU

To a new world -- of Gods

and monsters.

KAFKA

Gabriela! -- you did get away.

GABRIELA

I knew you walked this way to

work.  I wanted to find you

before they did.

KAFKA

-- I've just come from the

Castle.  It's over.

GABRIELA

(her eye glancing

far away)

Over?  It's only over when

you can crawl to a clean little

spot on earth where the sun

sometimes shines and you can warm

yourself a bit.

KAFKA

Gabriela ...?

GABRIELA

Should I tell you why I joined

our late lamented nihilists?

Why I became a murderer?

Because murder ... is bliss.

(looks at him)

It's easier than you might

think to absorb and assimilate

Evil -- once you've adopted its

procedure.

GABRIELA

Have you ever watched a person

deteriorate?  Day by day.  I

don't mean in a spiritual sense.

GABRIELA

Only two steps back?  Even the

man they left to guard me

retreated further than that.

KAFKA

I -- I found your jailer.

GABRIELA

This is the result of their

elixir of youth.  They were

to come and check on it during

the night.  I contrived to

miss the appointment.

KAFKA

They're dead now.  We can

get help.

GABRIELA

I know how they reward failure.

If they saw this I'd be rotting

in the quarries by the afternoon

-- with all the others.

KAFKA

There's a new potion -- he

said it was perfected.

GABRIELA

I know there is.  And you're

what I have to bargain with.

For now you're the last one

in their way.

KAFKA

I told you, they're

dead

.  It's

finished.

GABRIELA

Why should I believe a man who

never believed me?  They're

absolutely right, you know --

guilt should never be doubted.

It's easier that way.

GABRIELA

I think you've just escaped for

the moment.  Just as I did.  As

Eduard did.  As they let us do.

But only for the moment.

KAFKA

No -- not this time.

GABRIELA

I know better than you what

people will say when they have

to.  When they brought me in

for questioning I informed on my

friends the very first day.

KAFKA

-- Listen to me --

GABRIELA

I do.  Always.  You understand

the world better than any of

us, Kafka.  And what it's

becoming.

(pause)

I've always held you in the

highest regard.

KAFKA'S VOICE

Naturally things cannot in

reality fit together the way

the evidence does in my letter

-- life is more than a Chinese

puzzle.  But in my opinion

something has been achieved

which so closely approximates

the truth that it might reassure

us both a little and make our

living and our dying easier.

LUDWIG

We could go back to the office.

Explain ourselves to the Chief

Clerk.

OSKAR

They'd drive us away.  That

Kafka's made things very hot

for us.

I understand he was wounded

in the lung.

OSKAR

(sulky)

It doesn't matter.  It's too

late for all of us.

LUDWIG

(looks at O.)

What's to become of us now?

OSKAR

(looks at L.)

Amerika.  That's the place to go.

LUDWIG

Everyone in Amerika has a

toaster in their building!

OSKAR

Then that's the place for us!

LUDWIG

Amerika for us!

Amerika!
