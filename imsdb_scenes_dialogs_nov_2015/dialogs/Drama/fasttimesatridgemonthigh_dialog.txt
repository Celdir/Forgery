WAITRESS #1

I think he looks like Richard Gere.

WAITRESS #1 (CONT'D)

I think he looks like... Richard

Gere. (Bruce Springsteen)

LINDA

Did you see his cute little butt?

WAITRESS #2

Let's talk about C-19.

WAITRESS #1 AND LINDA

We were!

WAITRESS #2

I think I'll drop over and change

the shakers.

LINDA

No, be cool, that's Stacy's

section.

WAITRESS #1

He's too old for Stacy, she hasn't

even started high school yet.

LINDA

How's it going.

STACY

Do you think that guy's cute?

WAITRESS #1

In a blow-dryed kind of way.

STACY

Does anyone else want to take his

table?

LINDA

Don't you like him?

STACY

Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take

it. Really.

LINDA

Come on, Stacy, it's your section

and your man.

STACY

What should I do?

LINDA

Just take his order, look him in

the eye and if he says anything

remotely funny, laugh a lot.

RON

So you working hard or hardly

working?

RON (CONT'D)

You look like you could still be in

high school.

STACY

I know, everyone says that.

STACY (CONT'D)

What can I get for you tonight.

RON

How about your phone number?

THE RAT

Do you ever look at those girls who

work at Swenson's? They're

beautiful. And I have to stand out

here and watch them six nights a

week.

DAMONE

You should work for yourself.

DAMONE (CONT'D)

What can I do for you, gentlemen?

JUNIOR HIGH KID #1

You the guy with the Van Halen

tickets?

DAMONE

I could be.

JUNIOR HIGH KID #2

What do you want for something in

the first ten rows?

DAMONE

Twenty bucks apiece.

JUNIOR HIGH KID #1

Those tickets were only twelve

fifty!

DAMONE

So don't buy 'em.

JUNIOR HIGH KID #2

(to friend)

All the other scalpers are sold

out, Arnold.

DAMONE

Scalper? You call me a scalper? I

perform a service, my friends. The

service costs money. Now do you

want the tickets or not?

JUNIOR HIGH KID #1

Are you sure you can't go any

lower.

DAMONE

These are my special back-to-school

prices.

JUNIOR HIGH KID #2

We'll take 'em.

CUSTOMER

Hey Brad! I waited till you came

on! I wanted your fries.

BRAD

We need fifteen Superstars, David!

FELLOW EMPLOYEE #1

Okay, Brad!

BRAD

I'll take care of the fry orders!

Just get me the Superstars!

FELLOW EMPLOYEE #2

Fish sandwiches!

BRAD

Hey you guys! You had shirts on

when you came in here.

SPICOLI

Something happened to them, mon.

BRAD

Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you

just put your shirts back on? See

the sign?

DENNIS

Any problems?

BRAD

No, just a couple of surfers with

no shirts on. I took care of it,

Dennis.

DENNIS

Did you throw away those fries,

Hamilton?

BRAD

They were left over from the last

shift.

DENNIS

Those were perfectly good fries,

Hamilton.

(glares at Brad)

Perfectly good.

BRAD

But they weren't mine.

STACY

He gave me his card.

(lovingly)

'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'

LINDA

(amused)

Should we buy a frame for that?

STACY

Come on, Linda, I haven't had a

boyfriend all summer. You promised

when I started working at the mall

that my life would change... Do you

think he'll call this week?

LINDA

Listen, Stace, you want to know

about guys? I'll tell you. They're

mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I

chased after every guy I thought

was cute. I thought if I gave out a

vibe they'd get the message and

call me up. Well, guess what? They

don't call.

STACY

So what did you do?

LINDA

I called them. If I was sitting

next to a guy and I wanted to sit

closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted

to kiss him, I'd just do it. You

want Ron Johnson? Grab him.

STACY

I can't do that.

LINDA

Face it. With some guys you have to

make the first move. A lot of guys

are just... wussies.

STACY

Really?

LINDA

Stacy, what are you waiting for?

You're fifteen. I did it when I was

thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's

just sex. If you don't, one of the

other girls will.

STACY

(cute)

He was hot, wasn't he?

LINDA

If I didn't have a fiance in

Chicago, I'd go for it.

GIRL

(breathless)

Are you Linda Barrett?

LINDA

Yes.

GIRL

I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us.

Judy Hinton from May Company told

me I could ask you something.

GIRL (CONT'D)

I have this situation with my

boyfriend, and I wanted to...

(looks at Stacy, then

whispers in Linda's ear)

LINDA

Okay, are you over sixteen?

LINDA (CONT'D)

All right, what you want to do is

go to the Free Clinic and tell the

doctor that you have sex regularly

- several times a week -- and that

you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.

GIRL

And they don't call my parents?

LINDA

Not if you're over sixteen.

GIRL

Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.

LINDA

And don't let them talk you into a

diaphragm either.

STACY

I can't believe I start high school

tomorrow.

LINDA

Believe it.

BUDDY #1

Hamilton!

BUDDY #2

The cruising vessel! Hey -- Yooooo!

BRAD

Six more payments, gentlemen.

DAMONE

See that Mustang? U.C.L.A. gave

Charles Jefferson that car when he

was a sophomore.

DAMONE (CONT'D)

How ya doing! That car looks great,

Charles!

JEFFERSON

Don't... fuck... with... it.

DAMONE

Shit, that's my man.

ARNOLD

Brad, can I talk to you a minute?

BRAD

Arnold. What's happening?

ARNOLD

Brad, I really fuckin' hate

McDonald's, man. Ever since they

started in with the chicken,

everything went downhill.

BRAD

You want to work at Carl's?

ARNOLD

Oh, man, if you could swing

something there, I'd do anything

for you. I want to work with you

guys.

BRAD

I can probably get you in there.

Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.

ARNOLD

All right!!

STACY

Hi, Brad.

BRAD

Sis.

BRAD'S BUDDIES

Hey, Stacy.

STACY

Hi... Where's Lisa?

BRAD

Everyone wants to know where Lisa

is. How should I know where Lisa

is?

(to buddies)

What am I gonna do? Now my little

sister goes to the same high

school. The party's over.

(to Stacy)

So who do you have first period?

STACY

U.S. History. Mr. Hand.

BRAD

Hey-yo.

DAVID

Hey-yoooooooooo.

STACY

(concerned)

What's wrong with Mr. Hand?

BRAD

Nothing... if you like 'Hawaii Five

O.' You better get in class, Stacy.

That's not the one to be late to.

RICH

(as soon as she is gone)

Your sister is really turning into

a fox.

BRAD

You should see her in the morning.

BRAD'S BUDDIES

Hey-yooooooooooo.

MR. HAND

Aloha. My name is Mr. Hand.

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

(almost sweetly)

I have but one question for you on

our first morning 'together.'

(pause)

Can you attend my class? Pakalo?...

Understand?... History has proven

us one basic fact. Man does not do

anything that is not for his own

good. It is for your own good that

you attend my class. And if you

can't make it... I can make you.

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

We have a twenty-question quiz

every Friday. It will cover all the

material we've dealt with during

the week. There will be no make-up

exams. It's important that you all

have your Land of Truth and Liberty

textbooks by Wednesday. At the

latest.

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

Your grade is the average of all

your quizzes, plus the midterm and

final, which counts for one-third.

Got it?

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

Also. There will be no eating in

this class. You get used to doing

your own business on your own time.

That's one demand I make. I don't

like staying after class with you

on detention. That's my time. I

don't like wasting it. Just like

you wouldn't want me to come to

your house some evening and discuss

U.S. History on your time. Pakalo?

STUDENT

That guy has been stoned since the

third grade.

MR. HAND

Yes?

SPICOLI

Yeah. I'm registered for this

class.

MR. HAND

What class?

SPICOLI

This is U.S. History, right? I saw

the globe in the window.

MR. HAND

(appears enthralled)

Really?

SPICOLI

Can I come in?

MR. HAND

(swinging door open)

Oh, please. I get so lonely when

that third attendance bell rings

and I don't see all my kids here.

SPICOLI

Sorry I'm late. This new schedule

is totally confusing.

MR. HAND

Mr. Spicoli?

SPICOLI

That's the name they gave me.

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

You just ripped my card in two!

MR. HAND

Yes.

SPICOLI

Hey, bud. What's your problem?

MR. HAND

No problem at all. I think you know

where the front office is.

SPICOLI

You... dick.

MR. HAND

I've taken the time to print up a

complete schedule of class quizzes,

and the chapters they cover. Please

pass them back to the desks behind

you...

BRAD

You hear about the surfer in Mr.

Hand's class?

BRAD (CONT'D)

Told Hand to fuck off.

BRAD'S BUDDIES

Whoa!_

BRAD

Thompson!

BRAD (CONT'D)

I hear Thompson got canned at Bob's

this summer.

BUDDY #1

Yeah. They hacked his hours, so he

quit.

BRAD

Where is he now?

BUDDY #1

Making two eighty at Seven-Eleven.

BRAD

Man.

(pause)

They make you wear a fuckin' candy

stripe suit over there.

BUDDY #2

Poor guy.

BRAD

Poor guy.

STONER BUDDY #1

It was so bitchin', mon. Everybody

is talking about it.

STONER BUDDY #2

Totally.

SPICOLI

The motherfucker pissed me off.

STONER BUDDY #2

Totally. You don't have to take

that shit.

SPICOLI

I didn't take that shit.

STONER BUDDY #1

Tell us again. What happened after

he ripped up your ad card?

SPICOLI

I called him a dick. And then I

reached for his class notes, and I

ripped 'em up. I said, 'Hey bud.

Two can play this game.'

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

I'll tell you this. If he hassles

me again, I can't be responsible

for what happens... you know why?

STONER BUDDY #1

Because he's a fuckin' dick!

SPICOLI

You got it.

(pause)

Gimme a dollar.

LINDA

I hear some surfer pulled a knife

on Mr. Hand this morning.

STACY

No way! He just called him a dick.

LINDA

God. People exaggerate so much at

this school.

CINDY

Hi, Linda. God, you look so great.

LINDA

Hi, you guys. This is Stacy. Stacy,

this is Gregg Adams and Cindy Carr.

GREGG AND CINDY

Hi, Stacy.

LINDA

If there's one thing that never

changes... it's a cheerleader.

STACY

Linda. That girl looks just like

Pat Benatar.

LINDA

I know.

LINDA (CONT'D)

Actually, there are three girls at

Ridgemont who have cultivated the

Pat Benatar look.

LINDA (CONT'D)

None of them talk to each other.

STACY

Do you think guys find that

attractive?

LINDA

Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're

much prettier than them.

STACY

Yeah but they look more

sophisticated. You'd probably think

they'd be better in bed.

LINDA

What do you mean 'better in bed.'

You either do it or you don't.

STACY

No there are variables that, like,

I might not be good at.

LINDA

What variables?

STACY

(shyly)

Like, you know, giving blow jobs.

LINDA

What's the big deal?

STACY

Well I never did it.

LINDA

There's nothing to it.

LINDA (CONT'D)

You just have to practice a little

first.

(feels her throat)

Relax these muscles. Think of your

throat as an open tunnel.

STACY

What happens... don't laugh at me,

but when a guy has an orgasm... you

know, like, how much comes out.

LINDA

Just kidding. About 10cc.

STACY

(enlightened)

Oh! That's where that group got its

name from.

GIRL STUDENT

I'll tell you right now. I'm not

going. I'll get sick or something.

I'm not going into a room with a

bunch of dead guys.

ARNOLD

You'll go. It's part of the final.

GIRL STUDENT

(a Pat Benatar)

Have you heard what they do? I'm

serious. Have you heard?

BOY STUDENT

What?

ARNOLD

The bodies are dissected, Mike, and

Mr. Vargas pulls out parts of the

dead body and holds them up. Okay?

BOY STUDENT

You mean he reaches in and pulls

this stuff out?

GIRL STUDENT

Yes.

BOY STUDENT

Like a heart?

GIRL STUDENT

Hearts, lungs, guts...

MR. VARGAS

Good day, everyone! I just switched

to Sanka. I'm running a little slow

today, so have a heart.

DISSOLVE

TO:

MOTHER

Sleep tight, Stacy.

STACY

Good night, Mom.

STACY

(a little nervous)

Thanks for picking me up.

RON

No problem.

RON (CONT'D)

'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine

Columbian.'

(eyes Stacy)

You look nice tonight.

STACY

Thanks. So do you.

RON

Where do you feel like going?

STACY

I don't know. Wherever you want.

RON

How about the point?

STACY

(nervously)

The point sounds fine.

RON

(looks at her knowingly)

All right, the point it is.

STACY

That's a nice shirt.

RON

Thanks. Thanks a lot.

RON (CONT'D)

It's very warm out tonight.

STACY

It is. It's very warm. I wonder how

long it will last?

RON

Are you really nineteen?

STACY

Yes... I am really nineteen.

RON

I think I better take you home.

STACY

What about those other guys you

live with?

RON

No. I mean back to your home.

RON (CONT'D)

(whispers)

Is this your first time?

STACY

Yes.

Surf Nazis

DISSOLVE

TO:

LINDA

Was it great?

STACY

It was okay.

I LINDA

You'll always remember your first

time.

STACY

It was nice.

LINDA

So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it

serious?

STACY

Come on, Linda. It's just sex.

LINDA

Hey! That's my line!

BRAD

Mom says to clean up the pool.

STACY

Why can't you do it?

BRAD

Your friends use the pool. Your

friends messed it up.

STACY

Your friends use the pool too.

BRAD

I take out the garbage.

STACY

Don't strain yourself.

STACY

Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?

BRAD

They're not home yet.

STACY

Brad, what would you say if I asked

you to just put these flowers in

the trunk of the Cruising Vessel

and get rid of them at work?

BRAD

I'd say... who the hell is Ron

Johnson?

STACY

I'll explain everything later.

DAMONE

See that moustache coming in, Rat?

DAMONE (CONT'D)

See? You can almost press it out.

THE RAT

I am in love.

DAMONE

You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part

pussy.

THE RAT

What do you mean -- wuss? This girl

is my exact type. It's her.

Definitely her.

DAMONE

(distracted)

It's definitely your mama.

THE RAT

Damone, you gotta listen to me.

DAMONE

All right... where did you see her?

THE RAT

She's in my biology class.

DAMONE

Did you get her number?

THE RAT

No.

DAMONE

Did you get her name?

THE RAT

No. It's too soon.

DAMONE

It's never too soon! Girls decide

how far to let you go in the first

five minutes.

THE RAT

Well, what do you want me to do? Go

up to this strange girl in my

biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd

like you to take your clothes off

and jump on me?'

DAMONE

(thoughtfully)

I would. Yeah.

THE RAT

Really?

DAMONE

I can see it all now. This is going

to be just like the girl you fell

in love with at Fotomat this

summer. You bought forty bucks of

fuckin' film and you never even

talked to her.

THE RAT

(woeful)

You tell me, Mike. What do I do?

DAMONE

Okay. Okay.

(sighs, but loves it)

Here's what you do.

DAMONE (CONT'D)

You start from the second you walk

into biology. Don't just walk...

move across the room.

DAMONE (CONT'D)

Don't talk to her. Let her know.

Use your face. Use your body. Use

everything. This is what I do. I

just sent out the vibe and I have

personally found that... girls do

respond. Something happens.

THE RAT

Of course something happens. You

put the vibe out to thirty million

chicks, you know something's gonna

happen.

DAMONE

That's the idea, Rat. That's The

Attitude.

THE RAT

The Attitude? The Attitude dictates

that you don't care if she comes,

stays, lays or prays. Whatever

happens, your toes are still

tappin'.

When you are the cruelest and the

coolest... then you have The

Attitude.

DISSOLVE

TO:

LISA

Were those flowers really for me,

Brad?

BRAD

Of course.

LISA

How much did they cost?

BRAD

Don't worry about it.

BRAD (CONT'D)

Let's go to the Point tonight.

LISA

What's there to do at the Point?

BRAD

What's there to do at the Point?

God, Lisa, we've been going

together almost two years, and...

LISA

Brad. I don't want to have to use

sex as a tool.

BRAD

Tool? Tool for what? We've been

going together almost two years!

LISA

I don't want to talk about it here,

Brad.

TAYLOR

Hamilton! You have fifteen double

cheese to box!

BRAD

Come on in.

STACY

Thanks for getting rid of those

flowers.

BRAD

Don't worry about it. Who sent the

flowers?

STACY

It's just some guy I met at

Swenson's. You don't know him.

BRAD

I don't care it you tell me or not.

I got problems of my own.

STACY

Is everything okay at work?

BRAD

Are you kidding? Work is great. I

kill at work. I don't even mind Mom

and Dad making me pay rent.

STACY

You're going to break up with Lisa,

aren't you?

BRAD

I've been doing some thinking. It's

my last school year. I'm a single,

successful guy. I think I want my

freedom.

STACY

Why? Because she won't sleep with

you?

BRAD

Where did you hear that?

STACY

I'm just guessing.

BRAD

Well... it's true.

STACY

Maybe you just need to give her

some time. She's so nice, Brad.

Everybody loves Lisa.

BRAD

Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody

loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't

have to be her boyfriend.

STACY

Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?

BRAD

Why?

STACY

I don't know. I was just curious.

BRAD

Maybe yes. Maybe no.

STACY

You are a virgin!

BRAD

I didn't say that.

STACY

But your face did!

BRAD

Are you still a virgin?

STACY

Maybe yes. Maybe no.

BRAD

Don't give me that shit! I know

you're still a virgin!

STACY

There... There's his car. I know

he's at work tonight. He hasn't

come into Swenson's since he called

my house. My mother told him I was

still at high school, after I told

him I was nineteen. I guess I

should tell him I'm fifteen.

LINDA

Don't you dare, you'll never hear

from him again.

STACY

Does Doug care that you're

seventeen?

LINDA

Doug sees beyond that stuff to what

the person inside is like. That's

why I'm marrying him.

STACY

If he ever calls again I'll say I'm

eighteen.

LINDA

Boy I am so glad to be through with

all these games.

MR. HAND

C... D... F... F... F... three

weeks we've been talking about the

Platt Amendment. What are you

people? On dope? A piece of

legislation was introduced into

Congress by Senator John Platt. It

was passed in 1906. This amendment

to our Constitution has a profound

impact upon all of our daily

liv....

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

Where is Jeff Spicoli?

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

I saw him earlier today near the

200 Building bathrooms. Is he still

on campus?

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

Anyone?

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

Yes, Desmond?

DESMOND

I saw him by the food machines.

MR. HAND

How long ago?

DESMOND

Just before class, sir...

MR. HAND

Okay. Bring him in.

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

What is this fascination with

truancy? What is it that gets

inside your heads?

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

There are other teachers in this

school who look the other way at

truants.

(points to attendance clip

on the doorway)

It's a little game that you both

play. They pretend they don't see

you, you pretend you don't ditch.

Who pays the price later? You.

SPICOLI

Hey! Wait a minute! There's no

birthday party for me here!

MR. HAND

Thank you, Desmond.

(to Spicoli)

What's the reason for your truancy?

SPICOLI

I couldn't make it in time.

MR. HAND

(in top form)

You mean, you couldn't? Or you

wouldn't?

SPICOLI

I don't know, mon. The food lines

took forever.

MR. HAND

Food will be eaten on your time!

(pause)

Why are you continuously late for

this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you

shamelessly waste my time like

this?

SPICOLI

I don't know.

MR. HAND

I like that.

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

Don't you like that, Miss Hamilton?

STACY

Yes, sir.

MR. HAND

I really like that too. 'I don't

know'... that's nice. 'Mr. Hand,

will I pass this class?' 'Gee, Mr.

Spicoli, I don't know'. I like

that.

I think I'm going to leave your

words on this board for all my

classes to enjoy. Giving you full

credit, of course, Mr. Spicoli.

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

You can go now.

LINDA

You've got to get used to working

Christmas. People are always

screaming and yelling... then they

get home and they're all

Christmasy.

STACY

I think Christmas brings out the

worst in people.

LINDA

I guess Ron hasn't called yet.

STACY

Not since November.

LINDA

Stacy, it doesn't look good for the

relationship.

STACY

(sighs)

Don't you think it meant anything

to him. Even if I am fifteen?

LINDA

Stacy. What does it matter? He's a

stereo salesman. You want to marry

him? You want to have kids with

him? You want this guy to come

home, fifty years old, and he's

still got that little Pacific

Stereo badge on? Come on.

STACY

I should quit this job. I'm going

to get so fat working here...

nobody will ever take me out.

LINDA

Stacy. How many times do I have to

tell you? You are really going to

be beautiful... someday.

STACY

Thanks a lot.

LINDA

Hey -- Ron Johnson? It's his loss.

DAMONE

The business is changing, Rat. I'll

tell you, these kids today... they

don't even listen to Aerosmith.

THE RAT

I hear they all dress like that at

Lincoln now.

DAMONE

There used to be three or four of

those guys. Now we see 'em every

time we come to the mall.

CUSTOMER #1

Got any Blue Oyster Cult tickets?

DAMONE

No Cult. I ate twenty-four pairs of

Blue Oyster Cult tickets last time

around. I was this close to working

at 7-11. No Cult.

JEFFERSON

(after long look)

When is Earth, Wind and Fire

coming?

DAMONE

(respectfully)

I'm really not sure. I haven't

heard anything yet, but I'll let

you know the second there is the

slightest news, sir.

JEFFERSON

I'm taking my little brother.

DAMONE

Excellent. So that will be two

tickets... All right. Fine, sir.

CUSTOMER #2

Wow. He really lives here. I

thought he just flew in for the

football games.

DAMONE

(gaining composure)

Shit, he's my man. He knows where

to come for tickets.

DAMONE (CONT'D)

Well, Rat. Are you ready for the

moment of truth?

THE RAT

She is immune to my charms.

DAMONE

Hey, Rat.

THE RAT

Yeah?

DAMONE

Ace the jacket.

STACY

Hi. May I help you?

THE RAT

Yes. I have two questions. I was

curious...

THE RAT (CONT'D)

What do you do with the jackets

people leave here?

STACY

(smiling)

We keep them.

THE RAT

You keep them.

STACY

We keep them, in case the people

come back.

STACY (CONT'D)

Here they are. You can look through

it, if you want.

THE RAT

It's cool. It would take too much

time to go through all that stuff.

I'll just pick up a new one.

STACY

What's your other question?

THE RAT

My other question is... can-I-have

your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you

out-sometime?

STACY

Do you have a pen? This one's out

of ink.

THE RAT

Oh... yes.

THE RAT (CONT'D)

Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy. My

name is Mark Ratner.

BRAD

(talking to mirror)

Lisa? I have something to tell you.

Look, I'm a senior now.

I'm a single, successful guy and

I've got to be fair to myself.

Lisa... I think I need my freedom.

BRAD (CONT'D)

Aw, don't do that... don't take it

personally, okay? Please? I knew

you'd understand, because...

ARNOLD

Brad! I know you're on your break,

but would you cover me on register

three?

DENNIS

Come on. Clean that counter off

Brad. Let's go. Play ball.

BRAD

Okay, Dennis.

BRAD (CONT'D)

(nervously)

May I help you?

BUSINESSMAN

Yes. This is not the best breakfast

I ever ate.

BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)

And I want my money back.

BRAD

Well, I believe you have to fill

out a form. There's a pad right

around here.

BUSINESSMAN

No. I want my money back right now.

BRAD

Well, that's not the way it works,

really. And you ate most of your

food already, too...

BUSINESSMAN

See that sign? It says 100% Money

Back Guarantee. Do you know the

meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do

they teach you that here? Give me

my money back.

BRAD

I can't do that. But if you wait a

minute...

BUSINESSMAN

(as if talking to a

kindergartner)

Look. Just put your little hand

back in the cash register and give

me my $2.75 back. Okay?

(looks at name tag)

Please, Brad?

BRAD

I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find

the forms here.

BUSINESSMAN

I am so tired. I am so tired of

dealing with morons. How hard is it

to...

BRAD

Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm

gonna kick 100% of your ass.

BUSINESSMAN

Manager!!

DENNIS

Can I help you, sir? Is there a

problem?

BUSINESSMAN

You bet there's a problem! Your

employee used profanity and

threatened me with violence! I'm

shocked, frankly. I've eaten here

many times and I've always enjoyed

the service -- until today!

BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)

All I wanted was my money back for

this breakfast. It was a little

undercooked. And this young man

threatened me. Now I plan to write

a letter! I plan to...

DENNIS

Did you threaten this man or use

profanity in any way?

BRAD

He insulted me first. He called me

a moron.

DENNIS

Did you threaten this customer or

use profanity in any way?

BRAD

Yes, sir.

DENNIS

You're fired.

DENNIS (CONT'D)

(to Businessman)

I'm very sorry this happened to

you, sir.

BUSINESSMAN

Thank you very much.

BRAD

I hope you had a hell of a piss,

Arnold.

MERV GRIFFIN (O.S.)

Will you please give a warm welcome

to... Jeff Spicoli!

SPICOLI

(singing)

'Layin' ladies!

Drinkin' wine!

You gotta dollar --

You're a friend of mine!

Gettin' loose!

Feelin' fine!

You and me -- It's get down time!

We're on the Highway to Hell!

The Highway to Hell!'

GRIFFIN

How've you been?

SPICOLI

Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here.

I feel great.

GRIFFIN

I was going to say... your eyes

look a little red.

SPICOLI

I've been swimming, Merv.

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

Seriously, Merv, everything is

great.

I was thinking about picking up

some hash this weekend, maybe going

up to the mountains.

GRIFFIN

(concerned)

I wanted to talk a little bit about

school, if I could...

SPICOLI

School.

(sighs)

School is no problem. All you have

to do is go to get the grades. And

if you know something, all you have

to do is go about half the time.

GRIFFIN

How often do you go?

SPICOLI

I don't go at all.

GRIFFIN

I hear you brought a film clip with

you. Do you want to set it up for

us?

SPICOLI

Well, it pretty much speaks for

itself. Peter, you want to run with

it?

SPICOLI (V.O.)

Merv, this is the action down at

Sunset Cliffs at about six in the

morning.

GRIFFIN (V.O.)

Fascinating.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)

Who's that?

SPICOLI

That's me, Merv.

GRIFFIN (V.O.)

Are you going to ride that wave?

SPICOLI

Totally.

GRIFFIN

What's going through your mind

right here, Jeff? The danger of it

all?

SPICOLI

Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got

about four good hours of surfing

left before these little clowns

from junior high start showing up

with their boogie boards.

CURTIS

Dad says you have to get up!

SPICOLI

Ugh.

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

Leave me alone!

CURTIS

Dad says you're late again, you

butthole!

SPICOLI

Leave me alone.

CURTIS

Dad says!

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Daaaaaaaad! Jeff threw a snorkel at

me!!!!!!

CINDY

I just want to say that we are not

'Spirit Bunnies' anymore. We always

hated that name. It bugged the heck

out of Dina and me...

DINA

It's just such a put down.

CINDY

They don't call the Chess Club

'Checker Champs' or anything like

that. We're going to go to

everything this year, you guys.

We're going to go to soccer,

wrestling, basketball...

everything. We know you've got a

lot of spirit! Everybody --

riiiiiight? And we're gonna destroy

Lincoln next week? Riiiiiiight?

BRAD

Man, I don't even want to see those

guys from Carl's again.

LISA

If you'd apologize I think Dennis

would take you back.

BRAD

Apologize to that wimp? No way.

Fuck Dennis Taylor.

BRAD (CONT'D)

I'm just glad we're still together,

Lisa, because I need you this year.

LISA

(sighs)

Look, Brad, I've been trying to

think of a way to tell you this.

We're almost out of high school,

this is our last year. I think we

owe it to ourselves to be free, and

meet some new people. Then, if we

get back together, we'll know it's

the right thing.

LISA (O.S.) (CONT'D)

But I still want to be friends.

CINDY

We're going to be going to every

game this year. We just want the

crowd to participate and we want

spirit from every little person in

this entire school. Allll-Riiiight?

CONNORS

Well, thank you, girls. People,

don't forget, the big game is one

week away. We'll see everybody back

here on Monday and have a good

weekend.

Mark Ratner.

LINDA

Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?

STACY

Sixteen.

LINDA

Just watch out if he pulls up in a

van, and then puts on a Led

Zeppelin tape.

ARNAZ

The driver here has had jus' two

drinks. Two drinks at the home of a

STUDENT #1

He's fucked-up, Ricky!

STUDENT #2

They guys a drunk, Ricky!

ARNAZ

And although this driver thinks he

ees drivin' well, he may be 'doing

okay, but he forgets to per-ceive

what ees real goin' on...

SPICOLI

Be noble. Be aggressive. The thing

about Missile Command is to

decimate before you can be

decimated. Just like in real life.

DAMONE

Check it out, Rat. The Surf

Nazis... out for a Sunday stroll.

THE RAT

What do I say after she gets in the

car?

DAMONE

No problem, Rat. What you need is

my special Five Point Plan.

THE RAT

Knock it off, Damone. I need real

help.

DAMONE

What do you mean? Men have died

trying to obtain this information.

I will give it to you for free.

THE RAT

Okay. Tell me. What's the Five

Point Plan?

DAMONE

All right. Pay attention.

DAMONE (CONT'D)

First of all, Rat... never let on

how much you like a girl.

DAMONE (CONT'D)

(disinterested)

Oh. Hi.

(turns back to The Rat) )

Two. Always call the shots.

DAMONE (CONT'D)

Kiss me.

(to The Rat)

Three. Act like wherever you are,

that's the place to be.

(to Debbie Harry;

debonair) )

Isn't this great?

(to The Rat)

Four. When ordering food, find out

what she wants and then order for

both of you... it's a classy move.

(to Debbie Harry; Cary

Grant)

And the lady will have...

(to The Rat)

Five. And this is most important.

When you get down to making out,

whenever possible, put on the first

side of Led Zeppelin IV.

(to Debbie Harry;

seductive)

Why don't you put this tape on? It

sounds great in the back of my

van... why don't we listen from

there?

DAMONE (CONT'D)

And that is how you talk to a girl,

Rat. Voila. You can't miss.

THE RAT

I think I've got it. Once I get

going, I'll be okay. But... how do

I get started? I mean, I hardly

know her.

DAMONE

You wuss. It's no problem. One

person says something to the other

and that's how it starts...

CUT TO:

STACY

Thanks for coming to get me.

THE RAT

Sure thing.

STACY

This is a nice car.

THE RAT

Yeah. It's my sister's.

STACY

Do you have Mrs. George for

English?

THE RAT

Yeah. She is pretty good.

STACY

Yeah. She is pretty good.

THE RAT

Joey at Cinema Four said this is a

pretty good restaurant.

STACY

I've heard that, too.

THE RAT

Do you know what you want?

STACY

I think I'll have the Seafood Salad

Special.

THE RAT

Excellent.

STACY

Are you all right?

THE RAT

(weakly)

Oh yeah.

THE RAT (CONT'D)

Do you mind if I excuse myself for

a moment?

STACY

Not at all.

WAITRESS

Are you ready to order here?

THE RAT

Well... sure.

(settles back down)

She will have the Seafood Salad

Special. And I will have... the

same.

WAITRESS

Anything to drink?

THE RAT

Two Cokes.

WAITRESS

Okay. Thanks.

DAMONE

Yo.

THE RAT (V.O.)

Damone. It's Mark.

DAMONE

Mark. What happened to your date?

THE RAT

It's happening right now. I'm here

at the Atlantis. Everything's fine

except... I left my wallet at home.

DAMONE

Did you go home and get it?

THE RAT

No. It's too late. The food is

coming and everything. Damone, I've

got to ask you this favor, and I'll

never ask you for anything again in

this lifetime or any other. Will

you please borrow your mom's car,

go by my house, get my wallet, and

meet me back here?

THE RAT (CONT'D)

Damone, are you there?

DAMONE

(world-weary sigh)

I'm really pretty busy...

DAMONE (CONT'D)

You owe me for this one.

DISSOLVE

WAITRESS

Are you sure there's nothing else I

can bring you?

I'll have one more Coke... Do you

want another Coke, Stacy?

STACY

(quizzical) )

Sure. I'll... have another Coke.

THE RAT

Two more Cokes.

WAITRESS

(sarcastic)

Two... more... Cokes.

DAMONE

Hey, Mark. Is that you?

THE RAT

Damone! You come here?

DAMONE

I come for the seafood. It's great!

Hey... you know what, Mark? I found

your wallet the other day. You want

it back?

THE RAT

Wow. I've been looking for that

thing! Hey, Damone, have you met

Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike

Damone.

DAMONE

Well, I've gotta be running.

THE RAT

Okay. See ya.

DAMONE

Nice to meet you, Stacy.

STACY

Nice to meet you.

THE RAT

I had a really nice time tonight.

STACY

Me, too. I'm real sorry someone

broke in and stole your tape deck.

THE RAT

I never thought it would happen at

The Atlantis. Jeez.

STACY

Do you want to come inside?

THE RAT

Aren't your parents asleep?

STACY

No, they're away for the weekend.

Brad and I are watching the house.

THE RAT

Okay. Sure. I'll come in.

THE RAT

Where's your brother?

STACY

I don't know. Probably out. Want

something to drink?

THE RAT

No. That's okay.

STACY

Well, I'm going to change real

quick. I hope you don't mind.

THE RAT

Naw. I don't mind.

STACY

Will you unzip me?

STACY (CONT'D)

Thanks!

STACY (CONT'D)

You can come in, if you want!

THE RAT

So... pretty nice house you've got

here.

STACY

Thanks. So...

(puts hands on hips)

What do you want to do?

THE RAT

I don't know.

STACY

Do you want to see some pictures? I

kept a lot of scrapbooks and

pictures and stuff from junior

high. How stupid, right?

THE RAT

Sure.

STACY

This is me in the eighth grade. Did

you have Mr. Deegan?

THE RAT

(looking pained)

Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.

THE RAT (CONT'D)

Look, Stacy, I want you to know

that...

THE RAT (CONT'D)

... I've got to go home.

STACY

Do you really have to go?

THE RAT

Well... it's getting kind of late.

STACY

I guess it is getting late, Mark.

THE RAT

You blew it, asshole.

L.C.

Hey, slow down. This is my

brother's car.

SPICOLI

I thought he was out of town.

L.C.

He is.

SPICOLI

Then don't hassle it.

L.C.

Seen the new Playboy?

SPICOLI

Naw. Any good?

L.C.

Suzanne Somers' tits.

SPICOLI

All right.

L.C.

I like sex.

SPICOLI

Hold your beer down, L.C., I think

it's a cop.

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

This is a cop. He's definitely

cruising me at busting distance.

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

What the fuck is this guy doing?

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

What the fuck is this guy doing?

L.C.

This ain't no cop.

L.C. (CONT'D)

Hey! He's gonna scratch my

brother's car!

SPICOLI

It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!

L.C.

They're fuckin' with us.

L.C. (CONT'D)

My brother's car!

SPICOLI

All right. Die, Granada Jocks!

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

Would you roll your window up,

L.C.? It's messing my hair.

L.C.

We just missed the turnoff to the

party.

SPICOLI

You know the thing I love about

Mustangs? The steering wheel.

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

With a genuine Mustang steering

wheel, you can negotiate a hairpin

turn with ease, my man.

SPICOLI

Are you okay?

GRANADA JOCKS

Fuck youuuuuuuuuu!

L.C.

My brother is going to kill us.

He's gonna kill you and then he's

gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.

SPICOLI

Just be glad you're all right.

L.C.

My brother is gonna shit.

SPICOLI

Make up your mind. Is he gonna

shit, or is he gonna kill us?

L.C.

First he's gonna shit. And then

he's gonna kill us..

SPICOLI

Will you just relax, mon? He's not

gonna kill us. My father is a

television repairman. He's got all

kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.

L.C.

You can't fix this car, Spicoli.

SPICOLI

I can fix it.

DISSOLVE

Fish and chips place.

Which one?

BRAD

Just a fish and chips place.

STUDENTS

We'll be seeing you, Brad!

BRAD

(sullen)

Later.

SPICOLI

I think we may have gotten away

clean.

LINDA

I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll

be so glad when he gets out here.

STACY

(engrossed in book)

You really ought to look at this,

Linda. There's a drawing on every

page... and all these quizzes. It's

like school.

LINDA

Why don't you put your mother's

secret book back?

STACY

Listen to this... 'What are your

mate's three most erogenous zones?'

LINDA

(automatic)

Okay, penis, that's one, balls...

STACY

Wouldn't penis and balls be the

same category?

LINDA

You're right. Probably penis, mouth

and neck.

STACY

All right! Here's another one. 'The

most satisfactory lovemaking occurs

when your mate climaxes first, you

climax first, you and your mate

climax together?'

LINDA

Climax together.

STACY

Does that ever happen?

LINDA

No. But it's a nice idea.

STACY

Listen to this ... it says 'Most

women derive pleasure from sex, but

they don't have real orgasms.'

LINDA

Well... they obviously don't know

about Doug.

STACY

How long does Doug take?

LINDA

I don't know. Thirty to forty

minutes.

STACY

(pause)

What's Doug do in Chicago?

LINDA

He works for the airline. He'll be

out here. You'll meet him.

LINDA (CONT'D)

(wistful)

He's no high school boy.

DAMONE

Hey! We came over to help you with

Math homework!

STACY

Oh, really?

THE RAT

Really. We figured you needed the

help. On such a hot day.

STACY

What do you think?

LINDA

I think they're both virgins.

STACY

I didn't ask for any help. Did you,

Linda?

LINDA

No.

DAMONE

Well, that's exactly why I brought

some Wisk for the jacuzzi.

STACY

O-kay, you guys can come swimming.

But you have to leave as soon as my

Mom gets home. Okay?

DAMONE

Hey, Linda! I'll judge your dive.

I'm a champion diver myself.

BRAD

Does Mom know you have company?

STACY

It's just Linda. And Mark from

school.

BRAD

Hi, Linda.

LINDA

Hi, Brad.

BRAD

Well, you guys, keep it down. I've

got some work to do upstairs.

LINDA

God, he hardly even talks anymore.

STACY

I know. He hates to have to wear

uniforms.

DAMONE

Poor guy.

THE RAT

Really.

THE RAT

Why don't you get up and do a dive,

Mike?

LINDA

Go ahead.

DAMONE

No. I don't think so. Not right

now.

Do you have any Q-Tips?

STACY

God, I don't think so. Better look

Hey, Brad! Do you have any Q-Ti...

Wait just a... minute.

LINDA

Sorry. I didn't know anybody was in

BRAD

Doesn't anybody fuckin' knock

CUT TO:

MR. HAND

Now in 1898, Spain owned Cuba.

Outright. Think about it. Cuba,

owned by a disorganized parliament

4,000 miles away. Cubans were in a

constant state of revolt.

In 1904, the United States decided

to throw a little weight around,

PIZZA MAN

Okay, who had the double cheese

sausage and bologna?

SPICOLI

That's me.

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

MR. HAND

Am I hallucinating here? Just what

in the hell do you think you're

doing?

SPICOLI

Learning about Cuba. Having some

food.

MR. HAND

Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous

ground here. You're causing a major

disturbance in my class and on my

time.

SPICOLI

(cool and urbane)

I've been thinking about this, Mr.

Hand. If I'm here... and you're

here... doesn't that make it our

time?

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

So I thought I'd order us a pizza.

Just leave me a lot of bologna...

STONER #1

There's the pizza.

STONER #2

afternoon this week.

CUSTOMER

Why aren't you in school, son?

BRAD

I go to school in the mornings. I

afternoon.

BRAD

$8.46, please.

CUSTOMER

Here you go. I have it exactly.

(sets money down)

Good luck!

BRAD

Thank you, and thanks for coming to

Captain Kidd.

HAROLD

Hamilton! I'll take over the fryer.

Those boys at IBM need some Catch

of-the-Day boxes, and I told them

you would personally deliver them

within the hour. I'll reimburse you

for gas.

BRAD

Just write me out a bill.

HAROLD

Hamilton, come over here. What is

that you've got on?

BRAD

This is how I dress all the time.

HAROLD

But you took off your Captain Kidd

uniform.

BRAD

I thought I'd take it off for the

drive over to IBM. It's kind of

uncomfortable.

HAROLD

Come on, Hamilton. You're going

over there to represent Captain

Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores

all over Southern California. Part

of our image, part of our appeal is

in our uniforms. You know that!

BRAD

You really want me to put all this

stuff back on?

HAROLD

Yes. I think so. Show some pride,

Hamilton.

BRAD

I don't believe you're asking me to

do this, but okay.

the mornings, and then drives to

school himself.

DAMONE

What a guy.

DAMONE (CONT'D)

You know Mark Ratner really likes

you. You like him?

STACY

Mark is a really nice boy...

STACY (CONT'D)

But I think I like you.

STACY

Do you want to come in for a

second?

DAMONE

Do you have any ice tea?

STACY

Sure. Come on in.

STACY

I guess the annuals are coming in

pretty soon. Are you going to get

one?

DAMONE

I don't know.

STACY

Aren't you curious to see how your

class picture turned out?

DAMONE

I know what I look like.

STACY

Do you want to take a quick swim?

DAMONE

Well...

STACY

Brad probably has some trunks you

can borrow... I'm going to my room

to change!

DAMONE

This is great ice tea!

STACY

(from other room)

You don't have to shout! You can

come back here to my room!

STACY

Come with me! I know there's a suit

in the changing room!

STACY

Pick a suit.

DAMONE

I don't know. It's getting pretty

late...

STACY

Are you really a virgin?

DAMONE

Come on...

STACY

It's okay if it's your first time.

DAMONE

Listen. I feel pretty strange here.

Because Mark really likes you, and

he's my friend.

STACY

He's my friend, too.

DAMONE

You're a really good kisser.

STACY

So are you.

(pause)

Are you shaking?

DAMONE

(shaking)

No. Are you crazy?

STACY

(whispers)

Why don't you take off your

clothes, Mike?

DAMONE

You first.

STACY

How about both of us at the same

time?

STACY

I want you to know that it's your

final decision if we should

continue or not.

DAMONE

Let's continue.

STACY

(whispers)

Hey, Mike?

DAMONE

What? Are you all right?

STACY

I think we're making a lot of

noise.

DAMONE

I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

STACY

What's wrong?

DAMONE

I think I came. Didn't you feel it?

STACY

I guess I did.

DAMONE

I've got to get home. I've really

got to go, Stacy.

DISSOLVE

THE RAT

Today's April 16th. Damone never

STACY

What's April 16th?

THE RAT

It's John Bonham's birthday.

STACY

John Bonham?

THE RAT

John Bonham. The drummer for Led

Zeppelin. He died a couple years

ago. Every birthday he stays home

and plays everything John Bonham

ever recorded. It's like his own

holiday.

STACY

Oh. I see.

MRS. O'ROURKE

Have a seat, Brad... Brad have you

got your list of college

applications?

BRAD

Well, to tell you the truth Mrs.

O'Rourke, I've kind of been putting

it off. I'm not sure what I want to

do yet.

MRS. O'ROURKE

(by rote)

All right Brad. Let me ask you like

this. If I were queen of the world,

and I could make you whatever you

wanted to be, what would it be?

BRAD

I don't know... Burt Reynolds.

MRS. O'ROURKE

I realize it's important to have

fun in your senior year, with your

friends, but there comes a time

when you have to get serious about

your future, think about college,

and put aside all this fun.

BRAD

You know what, Mrs. O'Rourke? I

broke up with my girlfriend this

year. I lost my job at Carl's, and

two other places. I wake up at 5:30

to work at 7-11, then I go to

school, then I go back to 7-11. I

have to pay rent, you know. My

grades haven't been that bad, and

now you're telling me that the fun

is over. Well, I'm still waiting

for the fun to start.

MRS. O'ROURKE

Brad, I'll see you when I'm through

with the rest of the seniors. If

you want to visit the career

office, go right ahead. I'll talk

to you when you're more prepared.

This is part of your third quarter

exam, and I'd advise you to take

careful notes on what we're about

to see.

MR. VARGAS

May I just ask you one last time to

conduct yourselves with the utmost

maturity...

MR. VARGAS

As you know, all the bodies in this

room are recently deceased human

bio-structures.

MR. VARGAS

Yes, Randy?

RANDY

Who are these guys?

MR. VARGAS

Most of them were derelicts, Randy.

They sold the right for medical

examination of their bodies for

money. Something like thirty

dollars, I believe. Isn't that

right, Doctor Miller?

DR. MILLER

Twenty-five dollars.

SPICOLI

Twenty-five bucks is pretty good.

MR. VARGAS

Now this gentleman here is named

Arthur. Arthur died from heart

failure last week and we are

fortunate enough to view his body

in its pristine state.

MR. VARGAS (CONT'D)

This incision allows us to pull

aside the skin covering of the

chest cavity and really observe the

human organs as they exist in their

natural state.

MR. VARGAS (CONT'D)

I want all of you to take a look at

the chest cavity for just a moment.

MR. VARGAS (CONT'D)

Here we have the human lungs and

heart, which you can see is

actually located in the center of

your chest.

SPICOLI

Bitchin'.

STACY

I made a fool of myself.

THE RAT

Nobody noticed. Don't worry about

it. We'll just stay out here until

everyone comes out, we'll blend

back in.

STACY

What about the notes?

THE RAT

I'll get you the notes.

MONTALBAN

You see, Tatoo, what this man

doesn't realize is that he must one

day leave Fantasy Island. And he

must continue his life as an

incurable leper.

LINDA

Hello.

LINDA (CONT'D)

Yeah... you're kidding... What did

he say... What did you say... How

much did it cost? Look, tell him he

can have a relationship with you or

a 'more open' relationship with

someone else... Listen, Debbie, can

I call you later. I'm waiting for

Doug to call.

LINDA (CONT'D)

I'll bet he forgets to call again.

LINDA (CONT'D)

God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's

just David Soul and Ricardo

Montalban.

STACY

I don't know, I'm just so

depressed. Everything is just so...

depressing.

LINDA

You have been acting very strange

the last few weeks.

STACY

I don't know... I just don't feel

right.

LINDA

What do you think it is?

STACY

What do you think it is?

LINDA

It couldn't be.

STACY

It could be. I had a pregnancy test

at the clinic. I'll find out

Monday. I guess it was Damone.

LINDA

Of course it was Damone. If it was

Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!

STACY

I'm not going to tell him. He's an

asshole. I hate him.

LINDA

But it costs money to have an

abortion. Even at the Free Clinic.

You tell Damone to pay for it. It's

the least he can do. It's the guy's

responsibility too.

STACY

You know, there's one thing you

didn't tell me about guys.

LINDA

What?

STACY

You didn't tell me that they can be

so nice, so great... but then you

sleep with them and they start

acting like they're five years old.

LINDA

You're right. I didn't tell you

that.

DAMONE

What's going on?

STACY

Mike, there's something that's been

on my mind and I have to tell you

about it.

DAMONE

What? Now?

DAMONE (CONT'D)

Why don't you call me up tonight?

STACY

Mike. I want you to know that I'm

pregnant.

DAMONE

How do you know it's mine? We only

did it once.

STACY

I know it's yours.

DAMONE

You made me do it! You locked the

door. You made me do it! You wanted

it more than me!

STACY

Take that back.

DAMONE

All right, I take it back.

DAMONE (CONT'D)

There's only one thing we can do.

We've got to get rid of it. We've

got to get an abortion.

STACY

We've got to get an abortion?

DAMONE

Yeah. My brother Art got his

girlfriend one once.

STACY

It's already planned, Mike. It's

going to cost $150 at the Free

Clinic.

DAMONE

Doesn't sound free to me.

(pause)

So you want me to pay for it?

STACY

Half. Okay?

(bites back tears)

Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to

the clinic.

DAMONE

Seventy-five dollars, and a ride.

Okay.

DISSOLVE

TO:

FEMALE VOICE

Hello?

STACY

Hello... is Mike there?

FEMALE VOICE

Hold on.

FEMALE VOICE (CONT'D)

He says he's helping his father in

the garage and he'll call you back.

FEMALE VOICE (CONT'D)

Hello?

MRS. BARRETT (V.O.)

Hello?

STACY

Hi, Mrs. Barrett. Is Linda there?

MRS. BARRETT (V.O.)

She went off to the beach. She'll

be back later, though.

STACY

Okay. Thanks.

STACY (CONT'D)

Brad! Hey, wait a second!

STACY

Yeah. This is it. I have some

shopping to do.

BRAD

See you later.

STACY

Thanks a lot, Brad. I really

appreciate it.

NURSE

This is going to prick a little.

NURSE (CONT'D)

Now scoot over here.

DOCTOR

Hello, Stacy, I'm Doctor Bartell.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

Any questions before we begin?

STACY

This is going to hurt, isn't it?

DOCTOR

We'll use a local but you'll feel

some pressure. It doesn't last that

long.

STACY

Does it hurt more to have a baby?

DOCTOR

Yes... but I think you mind it

less.

NURSE

How are we doing in here? Debbie,

ready to leave?

NURSE (CONT'D)

Right through here. Stacy, I can't

let you go unless you have a ride

home.

STACY

Uh, my boyfriend said held be

waiting downstairs.

STACY

Brad!

BRAD

Since when do you shop at the Flea

Market anyway?

STACY

Brad. Please don't tell Mom and

Dad...

BRAD

Who did it?

BRAD (CONT'D)

You're not going to tell me, are

you?

STACY

No.

BRAD

All right, then. It's your secret.

STACY

I really thought he would show up.

I waited... and waited... and

waited...

LINDA

That little prick.

STACY

Then I called his house, and his

mother told me he was in the garage

helping his father.

LINDA

That little prick.

STACY

I paid for it and everything.

LINDA

There goes your stereo for another

year. Mike Damone is a no-brain

little prick. I'm not letting him

get away with this.

STACY

Don't do anything, Linda. I'd

rather just forget about it. I

don't even like the guy.

LINDA

Stacy, he's not a guy.

(loud)

He's a little prick!

DAMONE

Shhhhhhhhhit.

GIRL #1

Hi, Mike!

GIRL #2

Hi, mike!

DAMONE

Hi... girls.

THE RAT

Damone? What happened between you

and Stacy?

DAMONE

Let me tell you something, Rat.

Sometimes girls just go haywire. It

was a month ago, I've been trying

to think of a way to tell you ever

since. We started messing around

and...

(shrugs)

... something happened. It's all

over with. It's no big deal. I

never called her again.

DAMONE (CONT'D)

If you ask me, she's pretty

aggressive. You understand what I'm

saying?

THE RAT

No Damone. I don't understand.

DAMONE

She wasn't really your girlfriend

anyway.

THE RAT

Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot

of girls out there and you mess

around with Stacy. What have you

got to prove?

DAMONE

Jesus. I'm sorry.

THE RAT

I always stick up for you. Whenever

people say 'Aw, that Damone is a

loudmouth' -- and they say that a

lot -- I say 'You just don't know

Damone.' When someone says you're

an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not

an idiot. You just don't know him.'

Well, you know, Damone, maybe they

do know you pretty good. And I'm

just finding out.

DAMONE

Fine. Get lost.

DAMONE (CONT'D)

All right, Rat. You want to do

something about it?

DAMONE (CONT'D)

Well come on.

THE RAT

You come on.

DAMONE

No. You come on, you wuss.

SEXTON

Hey! Knock this crap off!!

DISSOLVE

TO:

SPICOLI

Hey, mon, can I use the bathroom?

BRAD

Go ahead. Just make it quick.

SPICOLI

Totally.

BRAD

It's the first door on your left.

SPICOLI (O.S.)

I can't find it, mon!

BRAD

It's the first door on your left!

SPICOLI (O.S.)

On the ledge?

BRAD

First door on your left!

SPICOLI (O.S.)

There it is!

ROBBER

I want money. And I want it all --

now.

BRAD

They empty and close the big safe

here at midnight.

ROBBER

(getting tougher)

I know this store. I know where the

safe is.

ROBBER (CONT'D)

Over there behind the donut case.

Now move!

BRAD

I'm instructed to tell you that we

are on a video alarm system and

there are other hidden cameras in

the store ...

ROBBER

Just give me the money. Move it.

BRAD

Okay.

(legs are shaking)

I just started here, and they just

taught me the procedure. I'll give

you the money, just let me figure

this out.

ROBBER

(very menacing)

Move it. Move it.

ROBBER (CONT'D)

(more menacing)

Let's go, stupid.

BRAD

You motherfucker. Get off my

fuckin' case.

SPICOLI

No towels, mon...

ROBBER

Aaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr!!!

BRAD

There goes your ride home.

SPICOLI

Awesome. Totally awesome.

STACY

Another summer of working at

Swenson's.

LINDA

Come on. There's lots of men around

here. Keep your eyes open.

STACY

You know, Linda. I've finally

figured it out. It's not sex I

want. Anyone can have sex.

LINDA

What do you want?

STACY

I want romance.

LINDA

Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even

get cable TV.

STACY

Mike! You have a mess on C-9!

DAMONE

All right. All right. I just

cleaned B-8. Give me a break.

STACY

Get going.

SPICOLI

I... am... so... wasted, mon. What

is in this shit?

(pause)

Doesn't that stuff cause brain

damage?

(pause)

Bitchin'.

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

Hey, mon, I am going to Mexico as

soon as school is out. Two more

weeks, bud. Week from Wednesday.

(pause)

I am gonna take both boards, my

duck feet, many cases of beer, and

just jam.

(pause)

No, mon, from school. I'm leaving

as soon as school gets out. I'll be

at Sunset Cliffs by nighttime.

(pause)

Totally.

(pause)

Later.

CURTIS

Jeff you have company!

SPICOLI

Go away, Curtis. If you can't

knock, I can't hear you.

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

That's better. Come in.

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

Mr... Mr. Hand.

MR. HAND

That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come

in?

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

(calling downstairs)

Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Spicoli.

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

Were you going somewhere tonight,

Jeff?

SPICOLI

Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr.

Hand. It's the last school event of

the year.

MR. HAND

I'm afraid we've got some things to

discuss here, Jeff.

SPICOLI

Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?

MR. HAND

Do you want to sit there, Jeff?

SPICOLI

I don't know. I guess so.

MR. HAND

Fine. You sit right here on your

bed. I'll use the chair here.

(pause)

As I explained to your parents just

a moment ago, and to you many times

since the very beginning of the

school year -- I don't like to

spend my time waiting for late

students, or detention cases. I'd

rather be preparing the lesson.

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

According to my calculations, Mr.

Spicoli, you wasted a total of

eight hours of my time this year.

And rest assured that is a kind

estimate.

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare

moment for me. Now I have the

unique pleasure of squaring our

account. Tonight, you and I are

going to talk in great detail about

the Davis Agreement, all the

associated treaties, and the

American Revolution in particular.

Now if you can just turn to Chapter

47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.

SPICOLI

Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.

MR. HAND

Well, then, I'm glad I remembered

to bring an extra copy just for

you.

DISSOLVE

TO:

SPICOLI

... so, like, when Jefferson went

before the people what he was

saying was 'Hey, we left this place

in England because it was bogus,

and if we don't come up with some

cool rules ourself, we'll be bogus,

too!' Right?

MR. HAND

Very close, Jeff.

MR. HAND (CONT'D)

I think I've made my point with you

tonight.

SPICOLI

Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a

question?

MR. HAND

What's that?

SPICOLI

Do you have a guy like me every

year? A guy to... I don't know,

make a show of. Teach other kids

lessons and stuff?

MR. HAND

Well, you'll find out next year.

SPICOLI

(smiling)

No way, mon. When I graduate U.S.

history I ain't even coming over to

your side of the building.

MR. HAND

If you graduate.

SPICOLI

(panicked)

You're gonna flunk me?!

MR. HAND

Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll

probably squeak by.

SPICOLI

All right! Oh, yeah!

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

Aloha, Mr. Hand!

MR. HAND

Aloha, Spicoli.

STACY

Where's Doug?

LINDA

He's not coming.

STACY

Not coming? What happened?

LINDA

He says he's got to stay in

Chicago.

(sighs)

He says I should visit him

sometimes.

STACY

Sometime?

LINDA

Yeah, like maybe never.

STACY

But what are you going to do?

LINDA

Well I might go to Dartmouth.

STACY

Dartmouth?!

LINDA

I didn't tell anyone I applied

cause I never thought I'd make it.

STACY

I can't believe it! But what about

Doug?

LINDA (STOIC)

There's a world of guys out there.

I just wish I didn't have to date

any of them.

STACY

Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his

loss.

DAMONE

Sign my annual, honey.

THE RAT

You're losing it, Damone.

DAMONE

You're crazy. Those girls love me.

SPICOLI

Hey, mon. Sign my annual.

TODD

Hey, mon, good thing we're going to

Mexico this summer. 'Cause you're

gonna get kicked out of your house

when your parents read your annual.

LISA

I saw your picture in the paper.

You had the greatest look on your

face!

ANOTHER STUDENT

Front of the Metro Section. I'm

telling my parents, 'I know this

guy, I know this guy.'

LISA

Will you sign my annual, Brad?

BUDDY #1

Fuckin' manager of 7-11!

BUDDY #2

Get us jobs over there, Brad! You

can do it!

BRAD

Since when do you guys want to work

at 7-11?

BUDDY #2

Come on, Brad! It would be great!

All of us together!

BRAD

Well, 7-11 is a tremendous

operation. It's really changed,

man. They've got great food, great

magazines, videogames... it's

class. Total class.

BUDDY #3

As soon as you can get us in there,

we're gone from Carl's, Brad.

BUDDY #2

Yeah, man, all the little punks

from junior high have taken over

the place.

BRAD

Hey, Thompson! Wendell! Get a job!

SPICOLI (O.S.)

Hamilton!

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

Awesome.

SPICOLI (CONT'D)

Easy, mon.

BRAD

STACY

Hey Mark! Turn around!

STACY (CONT'D)

Come over here!

THE RAT

You. Sit.

STACY

Hi, Mark.

THE RAT

Hi, Stacy. How are you?

STACY

I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you

came over here because I want you

to know something. I just thought I

would tell you that I really

enjoyed getting to know you this

year.

THE RAT

Yeah? About fifty people I didn't

know wrote that in my annual.

STACY

I know everybody says it, but I

really mean it.

THE RAT

Really?

STACY

Yeah. I want you to have this

picture, so you won't forget what I

look like. And so you'll remember

to call me over the summer.

THE RAT

Well, I don't know, I may be doing

some traveling this summer. I don't

know how much I'll be around...

(breaks down, takes

picture)

But I'll give you a call sometime.

STACY

I'd like that.

DAMONE

She wants it, Rat.

DAMONE (CONT'D)

I saw you. You had pure Attitude.

THE RAT

The Attitude, Damone, is only good

until you meet the right girl.

DAMONE

Whatever you say, Rat.

THE RAT

And... you can only tell it's the

right girl if you're sensitive.

DAMONE

Sensitive -- what is that?

THE RAT

Sensitive is when you can tell how

people feel without asking.

DAMONE

So what makes you so sensitive?

THE RAT

Well, for one, I read. I don't

watch as much television as you.

I'm trying to feel things more. I'm

learning a lot about people.

DAMONE

What do you read? What's the last

book you read?

THE RAT

Lust For Life. It's the story of

Vincent Van Gough.

DAMONE

(scoffs)

Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That

must mean I'm sensitive too.

THE RAT

It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I

put it out, and I have personally

found that girls do respond.
