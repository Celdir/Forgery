KANE'S OLD OLD VOICE

Rosebud...

FADE OUT:

"MAIN TITLE"

"CREDITS"

FADE OUT:

NEWS DIGEST NARRATOR

Legendary was the Xanadu where

Kubla Kahn decreed his stately

pleasure dome -

(with quotes in his

voice)

"Where twice five miles of fertile

ground, with walls and towers were

girdled 'round."

(DROPPING THE QUOTES)

Today, almost as legendary is

Florida's XANADU - world's largest

private pleasure ground.  Here, on

the deserts of the Gulf Coast, a

private mountain was commissioned,

successfully built for its landlord.

Here in a private valley, as in

the Coleridge poem, "blossoms many

an incense-bearing tree."  Verily,

"a miracle of rare device."

DISSOLVE:

NARRATOR

(dropping the quotes)

Here, for Xanadu's landlord, will

be held 1940's biggest, strangest

funeral; here this week is laid to

rest a potent figure of our Century -

America's Kubla Kahn - Charles

Foster Kane.  In journalism's

history, other names are honored

more than Charles Foster Kane's,

more justly revered.  Among

publishers, second only to James

Gordon Bennet the First: his

dashing, expatriate son; England's

Northcliffe and Beaverbrook;

Chicago's Patterson and McCormick;

DISSOLVE:

NARRATOR

Denver's Bonfils and Sommes; New

York's late, great Joseph Pulitzer;

America's emperor of the news

syndicate, another editorialist

and landlord, the still mighty and

once mightier Hearst.  Great names

all of them - but none of them so

loved, hated, feared, so often

spoken - as Charles Foster Kane.

The San Francisco earthquake.

First with the news were the Kane

papers.  First with Relief of the

Sufferers, First with the news of

their Relief of the Sufferers.

Kane papers scoop the world on the

Armistice - publish, eight hours

before competitors, complete details

of the Armistice teams granted the

Germans by Marshall Foch from his

railroad car in the Forest of

Compeigne.  For forty years appeared

in Kane newsprint no public issue

on which Kane papers took no stand.

No public man whom Kane himself

did not support or denounce - often

support, then denounce.  Its humble

beginnings, a dying dailey -

DISSOLVE:

NARRATOR

Kane's empire, in its glory, held

dominion over thirty-seven

newpapers, thirteen magazines, a

radio network.  An empire upon an

empire.  The first of grocery

stores, paper mills, apartment

buildings, factories, forests,

ocean-liners - An empire through

which for fifty years flowed, in

an unending stream, the wealth of

the earth's third richest gold

mine...  Famed in American legend

is the origin of the Kane fortune...

How, to boarding housekeeper Mary

Kane, by a defaulting boarder, in

1868 was left the supposedly

worthless deed to an abandoned

mine shaft: The Colorado Lode.

The magnificent Enquirer Building

of today.

DISSOLVE:

NARRATOR

Fifty-seven years later, before a

Congressional Investigation, Walter

P.  Thatcher, grand old man of

Wall Street, for years chief target

of Kane papers' attack on "trusts,"

recalls a journey he made as a

youth...

THATCHER

...  because of that trivial

incident...

INVESTIGATOR

It is a fact, however, is it not,

that in 1870, you did go to

Colorado?

THATCHER

I did.

INVESTIGATOR

In connection with the Kane affairs?

THATCHER

Yes.  My firm had been appointed

trustees by Mrs. Kane for the

fortune, which she had recently

acquired.  It was her wish that I

should take charge of this boy,

Charles Foster Kane.

NARRATOR

That same month in Union Square -

INVESTIGATOR

Is it not a fact that on that

occasion, the boy personally

attacked you after striking you in

the stomach with a sled?

THATCHER

Mr. Chairman, I will read to this

committee a prepared statement I

have brought with me - and I will

then refuse to answer any further

questions.  Mr.  Johnson, please!

THATCHER

(reading it)

"With full awareness of the meaning

of my words and the responsibility

of what I am about to say, it is

my considered belief that Mr.

Charles Foster Kane, in every

essence of his social beliefs and

by the dangerous manner in which

he has persistently attacked the

American traditions of private

property, initiative and opportunity

for advancement, is - in fact -

nothing more or less than a

Communist."

SPEAKER

(fading in on

soundtrack)

- till the words "Charles Foster

Kane" are a menace to every working

man in this land.  He is today

what he has always been and always

will be - A FASCIST!

NARRATOR

And yet another opinion - Kane's

own.

NARRATOR

Twice married, twice divorced -

first to a president's niece, Emily

Norton - today, by her second

marriage, chatelaine of the oldest

of England's stately homes.  Sixteen

years after that - two weeks after

his divorce from Emily Norton -

Kane married Susan Alexander,

singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton,

New Jersey.

DISSOLVE:

NARRATOR

For wife two, one-time opera singing

Susan Alexander, Kane built

Chicago's Municipal Opera House.

Cost: three million dollars.

Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane,

half-finished before she divorced

him, the still unfinished Xanadu.

Cost: no man can say.

DISSOLVE:

NARRATOR

One hundred thousand trees, twenty

thousand tons of marble, are the

ingredients of Xanadu's mountain.

Xanadu's livestock: the fowl of

the air, the fish of the sea, the

beast of the field and jungle -

two of each; the biggest private

zoo since Noah.  Contents of Kane's

palace: paintings, pictures,

statues, the very stones of many

another palace, shipped to Florida

from every corner of the earth,

from other Kane houses, warehouses,

where they mouldered for years.

Enough for ten museums - the loot

of the world.

NARRATOR

Kane urged his country's entry

into one war, opposed participation

in another.  Swung the election to

one American President at least,

was called another's assassin.

Thus, Kane's papers might never

have survived - had not the

President.

NARRATOR

Kane, molder of mass opinion though

he was, in all his life was never

granted elective office by the

voters of his country.  Few U.S.

news publishers have been.

Few, like one-time Congressman

Hearst, have ever run for any office -

most know better - conclude with

other political observers that one

man's press has power enough for

himself.  But Kane papers were

once strong indeed, and once the

prize seemed almost his.  In 1910,

as Independent Candidate for

governor, the best elements of the

state behind him - the White House

seemingly the next easy step in a

lightning political career -

FADE OUT:

NARRATOR

Then, suddenly - less than one

week before election - defeat!

Shameful, ignominious - defeat

that set back for twenty years the

cause of reform in the U.S., forever

cancelled political chances for

Charles Foster Kane.  Then, in the

third year of the Great

Depression...  As to all publishers,

it sometimes must - to Bennett, to

Munsey and Hearst it did - a paper

closes!  For Kane, in four short

years: collapse!

Eleven Kane papers, four Kane

magazines merged, more sold,

scrapped -

NARRATOR

Then four long years more - alone

in his never-finished, already

decaying, pleasure palace, aloof,

seldom visited, never photographed,

Charles Foster Kane continued to

direct his falling empire ... vainly

attempting to sway, as he once

did, the destinies of a nation

that has ceased to listen to him

... ceased to trust him...

NARRATOR

Last week, death came to sit upon

the throne of America's Kubla Khan -

last week, as it must to all men,

death came to Charles Foster Kane.

DISSOLVE:

THIRD MAN

(at phone)

Stand by.  I'll tell you if we

want to run it again.

(hangs up)

THOMPSON'S VOICE

Well?

A MAN'S VOICE

It's a tough thing to do in a

newsreel.  Seventy years of a man's

life -

A VOICE

See what Arthur Ellis wrote about

him in the American review?

THIRD MAN

I read it.

THE VOICE

(its owner is already

leaning across the

table, holding a

piece of paper

under the desk

light and reading

from it)

Listen:  Kane is dead.  He

contributed to the journalism of

his day - the talent of a

mountebank, the morals of a

bootlegger, and the manners of a

pasha.  He and his kind have almost

succeeded in transforming a once

noble profession into a seven

percent security - no longer secure.

ANOTHER VOICE

That's what Arthur Ellis is writing

now.  Thirty years ago, when Kane

gave him his chance to clean up

Detroit and Chicago and St. Louis,

Kane was the greatest guy in the

world.  If you ask me -

ANOTHER VOICE

Charles Foster Kane was a...

RAWLSTON'S VOICE

Just a minute!

RAWLSTON

What were Kane's last words?

RAWLSTON

What were the last words he said

on earth?  Thompson, you've made

us a good short, but it needs

character -

SOMEBODY'S VOICE

Motivation -

RAWLSTON

That's it - motivation.  What made

Kane what he was?  And, for that

matter, what was he?  What we've

just seen are the outlines of a

career - what's behind the career?

What's the man?  Was he good or

bad?  Strong or foolish?  Tragic

or silly?  Why did he do all those

things?  What was he after?

(then, appreciating

his point)

Maybe he told us on his death bed.

THOMPSON

Yes, and maybe he didn't.

RAWLSTON

Ask the question anyway, Thompson!

Build the picture around the

question, even if you can't answer

it.

THOMPSON

I know, but -

RAWLSTON

(riding over him

like any other

producer)

All we saw on that screen was a

big American -

A VOICE

One of the biggest.

RAWLSTON

(without pausing

for this)

But how is he different from Ford?

Or Hearst for that matter?  Or

Rockefeller - or John Doe?

A VOICE

I know people worked for Kane will

tell you - not only in the newspaper

business - look how he raised

salaries.  You don't want to forget -

ANOTHER VOICE

You take his labor record alone,

they ought to hang him up like a

dog.

RAWLSTON

I tell you, Thompson - a man's

dying words -

SOMEBODY'S VOICE

What were they?

SOMEBODY'S VOICE

(hesitant)

Yes, Mr. Rawlston, what were Kane's

dying words?

RAWLSTON

(with disgust)

Rosebud!

RAWLSTON

That's right.

A VOICE

Tough guy, huh?

(derisively)

Dies calling for Rosebud!

RAWLSTON

Here's a man who might have been

President.  He's been loved and

hated and talked about as much as

any man in our time - but when he

comes to die, he's got something

on his mind called "Rosebud."

What does that mean?

ANOTHER VOICE

A racehorse he bet on once,

probably, that didn't come in -

Rosebud!

RAWLSTON

All right.  But what was the race?

RAWLSTON

Thompson!

THOMPSON

Yes, sir.

RAWLSTON

Hold this thing up for a week.

Two weeks if you have to...

THOMPSON

(feebly)

But don't you think if we release

it now - he's only been dead four

days it might be better than if -

RAWLSTON

(decisively)

Nothing is ever better than finding

out what makes people tick.  Go

after the people that knew Kane

well.  That manager of his - the

little guy, Bernstein, those two

wives, all the people who knew

him, had worked for him, who loved

him, who hated his guts -

(pauses)

I don't mean go through the City

Directory, of course -

THOMPSON

I'll get to it right away, Mr.

Rawlston.

RAWLSTON

(rising)

Good!

RAWLSTON'S VOICE

It'll probably turn out to be a

very simple thing...

FADE OUT:

DISSOLVE:

THE CAPTAIN

(a Greek)

This is Mr. Thompson, Miss

Alexander.

SUSAN

(to the Captain)

I want another drink, John.

THE CAPTAIN

(seeing his chance)

Right away.  Will you have

something, Mr. Thompson?

THOMPSON

(staring to sit

down)

I'll have a highball.

SUSAN

(so insistently as

to make Thompson

change his mind

and stand up again)

Who told you you could sit down

here?

THOMPSON

Oh!  I thought maybe we could have

a drink together?

SUSAN

Think again!

SUSAN

Why don't you people let me alone?

I'm minding my own business.  You

mind yours.

THOMPSON

If you'd just let me talk to you

for a little while, Miss Alexander.

All I want to ask you...

SUSAN

Get out of here!

(almost hysterical)

Get out!  Get out!

THOMPSON

I'm sorry.  Maybe some other time -

THE CAPTAIN

She's just not talking to anybody

from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.

THOMPSON

I'm not from a newspaper exactly,

I -

THE CAPTAIN

(to the waiter)

Get her another highball.

THE WAITER

Another double?

THE CAPTAIN

(after a moment,

pityingly)

Yes.

THOMPSON

She's plastered, isn't she?

THE CAPTAIN

She'll snap out of it.  Why, until

he died, she'd just as soon talk

about Mr. Kane as about anybody.

Sooner.

THOMPSON

I'll come down in a week or so and

see her again.  Say, you might be

able to help me.  When she used to

talk about Kane - did she ever

happen to say anything - about

Rosebud?

THE CAPTAIN

Rosebud?

THE CAPTAIN

Thank you, sir.  As a matter of

fact, yesterday afternoon, when it

was in all the papers - I asked

her.  She never heard of Rosebud.

FADE OUT:

BERTHA

(into phone)

Yes.  I'll take him in now.

(hangs up and looks

at Thompson)

The directors of the Thatcher

Library have asked me to remind

you again of the condition under

which you may inspect certain

portions of Mr. Thatcher's

unpublished memoirs.  Under no

circumstances are direct quotations

from his manuscript to be used by

you.

THOMPSON

That's all right.

BERTHA

You may come with me.

DISSOLVE OUT:

BERTHA

(to the guard)

Pages eighty-three to one hundred

and forty-two, Jennings.

GUARD

Yes, Miss Anderson.

BERTHA

(to Thompson)

You will confine yourself, it is

our understanding, to the chapter

dealing with Mr. Kane.

THOMPSON

That's all I'm interested in.

BERTHA

You will be required to leave this

room at four-thirty promptly.

DISSOLVES INTO:

MRS. KANE

(calling out)

Be careful, Charles!

THATCHER'S VOICE

Mrs. Kane -

MRS. KANE

(Calling out the

window almost on

top of this)

Pull your muffler around your neck,

Charles -

THATCHER'S VOICE

think we'll have to tell him now -

MRS. KANE

I'll sign those papers -

KANE SR.

You people seem to forget that I'm

the boy's father.

MRS. KANE

It's going to be done exactly the

way I've told Mr. Thatcher -

KANE SR.

If I want to, I can go to court.

father has a right to -

THATCHER

(annoyed)

Mr. Kane, the certificates that

Mr.  Graves left here are made out

to Mrs.  Kane, in her name.  Hers

to do with as she pleases -

KANE SR.

Well, I don't hold with signing my

boy away to any bank as guardian

just because -

MRS. KANE

(quietly)

I want you to stop all this

nonsense, Jim.

THATCHER

The Bank's decision in all matters

concerning his education, his place

of residence and similar subjects

will be final.

(clears his throat)

KANE SR.

The idea of a bank being the

guardian -

MRS. KANE

(even more quietly)

I want you to stop all this

nonsense, Jim.

THATCHER

We will assume full management of

the Colorado Lode - of which you,

Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.

MRS. KANE

(has been reading

past Thatcher's

shoulder as he

talked)

Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?

THATCHER

Right here, Mrs. Kane.

KANE SR.

(sulkily)

Don't say I didn't warn you.

KANE SR.

Mary, I'm asking you for the last

time - anyon'd think I hadn't been

a good husband and a -

THATCHER

The sum of fifty thousand dollars

a year is to be paid to yourself

and Mr. Kane as long as you both

live, and thereafter the survivor -

KANE SR.

Well, let's hope it's all for the

best.

MRS. KANE

It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -

KANE

If the rebels want a fight boys,

let's give it to 'em!

KANE

The terms are underconditional

surrender.  Up and at 'em!  The

Union forever!

THATCHER

(over the boy's

voice)

Everything else - the principal as

well as all monies earned - is to

be administered by the bank in

trust for your son, Charles Foster

Kane, until his twenty-fifth

birthday, at which time he is to

come into complete possession.

MRS. KANE

Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

KANE

You can't lick Andy Jackson!  Old

Hickory, that's me!

THATCHER'S VOICE

It's nearly five, Mrs. Kane, don't

you think I'd better meet the boy -

MRS. KANE

I've got his trunk all packed -

(she chokes a little)

I've it packed for a couple of

weeks -

THATCHER

I've arranged for a tutor to meet

us in Chicago.  I'd have brought

him along with me, but you were so

anxious to keep everything secret -

KANE

H'ya, Mom.

KANE

(gesturing at the

snowman)

See, Mom?  I took the pipe out of

his mouth.  If it keeps on snowin',

maybe I'll make some teeth and -

MRS. KANE

You better come inside, son.  You

and I have got to get you all ready

for - for -

THATCHER

Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -

MRS. KANE

This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

THATCHER

How do you do, Charles?

KANE SR.

He comes from the east.

KANE

Hello.  Hello, Pop.

KANE SR.

Hello, Charlie!

MRS. KANE

Mr. Thatcher is going to take you

on a trip with him tonight, Charles.

You'll be leaving on Number Ten.

KANE SR.

That's the train with all the

lights.

KANE

You goin', Mom?

THATCHER

Your mother won't be going right

away, Charles -

KANE

Where'm I going?

KANE SR.

You're going to see Chicago and

New York - and Washington, maybe...

Isn't he, Mr. Thatcher?

THATCHER

(heartily)

He certainly is.  I wish I were a

little boy and going to make a

trip like that for the first time.

KANE

Why aren't you comin' with us,

Mom?

MRS. KANE

We have to stay here, Charles.

KANE SR.

You're going to live with Mr.

Thatcher from now on, Charlie!

You're going to be rich.  Your Ma

figures - that is, re - she and I

have decided that this isn't the

place for you to grow up in.

You'll probably be the richest man

in America someday and you ought

to -

MRS. KANE

You won't be lonely, Charles...

THATCHER

We're going to have a lot of good

times together, Charles...  Really

we are.

THATCHER

Come on, Charles.  Let's shake

hands.

(extends his hand.

Charles continues

to look at him)

Now, now!  I'm not as frightening

as all that!  Let's shake, what do

you say?

THATCHER

(with a sickly grin)

You almost hurt me, Charles.

(moves towards him)

Sleds aren't to hit people with.

Sleds are to - to sleigh on.  When

we get to New York, Charles, we'll

get you a sled that will -

MRS. KANE

Charles!

KANE

(frightened)

Mom!  Mom!

MRS. KANE

It's all right, Charles, it's all

right.

KANE SR.

Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid

needs is a good thrashing!

MRS. KANE

That's what you think, is it, Jim?

KANE SR.

Yes.

MRS. KANE

(slowly)

That's why he's going to be brought

up where you can't get at him.

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE:

KANE

Mom!  Mom!

DISSOLVE OUT:

THATCHER

(coldly)

Is that really your idea of how to

run a newspaper?

KANE

I don't know how to run a newspaper,

Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything

I can think of.

THATCHER

(reading headline

of paper he is

still holding)

"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."

You know you haven't the slightest

proof that this - this armada - is

off the Jersey Coast.

KANE

Can you prove it isn't?

KANE

Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -

BERNSTEIN

How are you, Mr. Thatcher?

THATCHER

How do you do? -

BERNSTEIN

We just had a wire from Cuba, Mr.

Kane -

(stops, embarrassed)

KANE

That's all right.  We have no

secrets from our readers.  Mr.

Thatcher is one of our most devoted

readers, Mr.  Bernstein.  He knows

what's wrong with every issue since

I've taken charge.  What's the

cable?

BERNSTEIN

(reading)

The food is marvelous in Cuba the

senoritas are beautiful stop I

could send you prose poems of palm

trees and sunrises and tropical

colors blending in far off

landscapes but don't feel right in

spending your money for this stop

there's no war in Cuba regards

Wheeler.

THATCHER

You see!  There hasn't been a true

word -

KANE

I think we'll have to send our

friend Wheeler a cable, Mr.

Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have

to make it shorter than his, because

he's working on an expense account

and we're not.  Let me see -

(snaps his fingers)

Mike!

MIKE

(a fairly tough

customer prepares

to take dictation,

his mouth still

full of food)

Go ahead, Mr. Kane.

KANE

Dear Wheeler -

(pauses a moment)

You provide the prose poems - I'll

provide the war.

BERNSTEIN

That's fine, Mr. Kane.

KANE

I rather like it myself.  Send it

right away.

MIKE

Right away.

BERNSTEIN

Right away.

THATCHER

I came to see you, Charles, about

your - about the Enquirer's campaign

against the Metropolitan Transfer

Company.

KANE

Won't you step into my office, Mr.

Thatcher?

THATCHER

I think I should remind you,

Charles, of a fact you seem to

have forgotten.  You are yourself

one of the largest individual

stockholders.

KANE

Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything

I've been saying in the Enquirer

about the traction trust absolutely

true?

THATCHER

(angrily)

They're all part of your general

attack - your senseless attack -

on everything and everybody who's

got more than ten cents in his

pocket.  They're -

KANE

The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you

don't realize you're talking to

two people.

KANE

As Charles Foster Kane, who has

eighty-two thousand, six hundred

and thirty-one shares of

Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I

do have a rough idea of my holdings -

I sympathize with you.  Charles

Foster Kane is a dangerous

scoundrel, his paper should be run

out of town and a committee should

be formed to boycott him.  You

may, if you can form such a

committee, put me down for a

contribution of one thousand

dollars.

THATCHER

(angrily)

Charles, my time is too valuable

for me -

KANE

On the other hand -

(his manner becomes

serious)

I am the publisher of the Enquirer.

As such, it is my duty - I'll let

you in on a little secret, it is

also my pleasure - to see to it

that decent, hard-working people

of this city are not robbed blind

by a group of money - mad pirates

because, God help them, they have

no one to look after their

interests!  I'll let you in on

another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.

I think I'm the man to do it.  You

see, I have money and property -

KANE

If I don't defend the interests of

the underprivileged, somebody else

will - maybe somebody without any

money or any property and that

would be too bad.

KANE

Do you know how to tap, Mr.

Thatcher?  You ought to learn -

(humming quietly,

he continues to

dance)

THATCHER

I happened to see your consolidated

statement yesterday, Charles.

Could I not suggest to you that it

is unwise for you to continue this

philanthropic enterprise -

(sneeringly)

this Enquirer - that is costing

you one million dollars a year?

KANE

You're right.  We did lose a million

dollars last year.

KANE

We expect to lost a million next

year, too.  You know, Mr. Thatcher -

(starts tapping

quietly)

at the rate of a million a year -

we'll have to close this place in

sixty years.

DISSOLVE:

MISS ANDERSON

You have enjoyed a very rare

privilege, young man.  Did you

find what you were looking for?

THOMPSON

No.  Tell me something, Miss

Anderson.  You're not Rosebud, are

you?

MISS ANDERSON

What?

THOMPSON

I didn't think you were.  Well,

thanks for the use of the hall.

FADE OUT:

BERNSTEIN

(wryly)

Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman

of the Board.  I got nothing but

time ...  What do you want to know?

THOMPSON

(still explaining)

Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with

Mr.  Kane from the very beginning -

BERNSTEIN

From before the beginning, young

fellow.  And now it's after the

end.

(turns to Thompson)

Anything you want to know about

him - about the paper -

THOMPSON

-  We thought maybe, if we can

find out what he meant by that

last word - as he was dying -

BERNSTEIN

That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?

There were a lot of them back in

the early days, and -

THOMPSON

Not some girl he knew casually and

then remembered after fifty years,

on his death bed -

BERNSTEIN

You're pretty young, Mr. -

(remembers the name)

Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will

remember things you wouldn't think

he'd remember.  You take me.  One

day, back in 1896, I was crossing

over to Jersey on a ferry and as

we pulled out, there was another

ferry pulling in -

(slowly)

- and on it, there was a girl

waiting to get off.  A white dress

she had on - and she was carrying

a white pastrol - and I only saw

her for one second and she didn't

see me at all - but I'll bet a

month hasn't gone by since that I

haven't thought of that girl.

(triumphantly)

See what I mean?

(smiles)

Well, so what are you doing about

this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.

THOMPSON

I'm calling on people who knew Mr.

Kane.  I'm calling on you.

BERNSTEIN

Who else you been to see?

THOMPSON

Well, I went down to Atlantic City -

BERNSTEIN

Susie?  I called her myself the

day after he died.  I thought maybe

somebody ought to...

(sadly)

She couldn't even come to the

'phone.

THOMPSON

You know why?  She was so -

BERNSTEIN

Sure, sure.

THOMPSON

I'm going back there.

BERNSTEIN

Who else did you see?

THOMPSON

Nobody else, but I've been through

that stuff of Walter Thatcher's.

That journal of his -

BERNSTEIN

Thatcher!  That man was the biggest

darn fool I ever met -

THOMPSON

He made an awful lot of money.

BERNSTEIN

It's not trick to make an awful

lot of money if all you want is to

make a lot of money.

(his eyes get

reflective)

Thatcher!

BERNSTEIN

He never knew there was anything

in the world but money.  That kind

of fellow you can fool every day

in the week - and twice on Sundays!

(reflectively)

The time he came to Rome for Mr.

Kane's twenty-fifth birthday...

You know, when Mr. Kane got control

of his own

money...  Such a fool like Thatcher -

I tell you, nobody's business!

DISSOLVE OUT:

BERNSTEIN

He knew what he wanted, Mr. Kane

did, and he got it!  Thatcher never

did figure him out.  He was hard

to figure sometimes, even for me.

Mr. Kane was a genius like he said.

He had that funny sense of humor.

Sometimes even I didn't get the

joke.  Like that night the opera

house of his opened in Chicago...

You know, the opera house he built

for Susie, she should be an opera

singer...

(indicates with a

little wave of his

hand what he thinks

of that; sighing)

That was years later, of course -

1914 it was.  Mrs. Kane took the

leading part in the opera, and she

was terrible.  But nobody had the

nerve to say so - not even the

critics.  Mr. Kane was a big man

in those days.  But this one fellow,

this friend of his, Branford Leland -

DISSOLVE:

CITY EDITOR

(turns to a young

hireling; quietly)

What about Branford Leland?  Has

he got in his copy?

HIRELING

Not yet.

BERNSTEIN

Go in and ask him to hurry.

CITY EDITOR

Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein?

You know Mr. Leland.

BERNSTEIN

(looks at him for a

moment; then slowly)

I might make him nervous.

CITY EDITOR

(after a pause)

You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you

were great friends back in the old

days, I understand.

BERNSTEIN

(with a smile)

That's right.  They called us the

"Three Musketeers."

CITY EDITOR

He's a great guy - Leland.

(another little

pause)

Why'd he ever leave New York?

BERNSTEIN

(he isn't saying)

That's a long story.

ANOTHER HIRELING

(a tactless one)

Wasn't there some sort of quarrel

between -

BERNSTEIN

(quickly)

I had nothing to do with it.

(then, somberly)

It was Leland and Mr. Kane, and

you couldn't call it a quarrel

exactly.  Better we should forget

such things -

(turning to City

Editor)

Leland is writing it up from the

dramatic angle?

CITY EDITOR

Yes.  I thought it was a good idea.

We've covered it from the news

end, of course.

BERNSTEIN

And the social.  How about the

music notice?  You got that in?

CITY EDITOR

Oh, yes, it's already made up.

Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.

BERNSTEIN

Enthusiastic?

CITY EDITOR

Yes, very!

(quietly)

Naturally.

BERNSTEIN

Well, well - isn't that nice?

KANE'S VOICE

Mr. Bernstein -

BERNSTEIN

Hello, Mr. Kane.

CITY EDITOR

Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!

KANE

We've got a nice plant here.

KANE

Was the show covered by every

department?

CITY EDITOR

Exactly according to your

instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got

two spreads of pictures.

KANE

(very, very casually)

And the notice?

CITY EDITOR

Yes - Mr. Kane.

KANE

(quietly)

Is it good?

CITY EDITOR

Yes, Mr. kane.

CITY EDITOR

But there's another one still to

come - the dramatic notice.

KANE

(sharply)

It isn't finished?

CITY EDITOR

No, Mr. Kane.

KANE

That's Leland, isn't it?

CITY EDITOR

Yes, Mr. Kane.

KANE

Has he said when he'll finish?

CITY EDITOR

We haven't heard from him.

KANE

He used to work fast - didn't he,

Mr. Bernstein?

BERNSTEIN

He sure did, Mr. Kane.

KANE

Where is he?

ANOTHER HIRELING

Right in there, Mr. Kane.

BERNSTEIN

(helpless, but very

concerned)

MR. KANE -

KANE

That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.

BERNSTEIN

Leland and Mr. Kane - they haven't

spoke together for ten years.

(long pause; finally)

Excuse me.

(starts toward the

door)

BERNSTEIN

Hey, Brad!  Brad!

(he straightens,

looks at Kane;

pause)

He ain't been drinking before, Mr.

Kane.  Never.  We would have heard.

KANE

(finally; after a

pause)

What does it say there?

KANE

What's he written?

BERNSTEIN

(reading)

"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty

but hopelessly incompetent amateur -

(he waits for a

minute to catch

his breath; he

doesn't like it)

- last night opened the new Chicago

Opera House in a performance of -

of -"

(looks up miserably)

I can't pronounce that name, Mr.

Kane.

KANE

Thais.

BERNSTEIN

(reading again)

"Her singing, happily, is no concern

of this department.  Of her acting,

it is absolutely impossible to..."

(he continues to

stare at the page)

KANE

(after a short

silence)

Go on!

BERNSTEIN

(without looking up)

That's all there is.

KANE

Of her acting, it is absolutely

impossible to say anything except

that it represents a new low...

(then sharply)

Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein?

In the opinion of this reviewer -

BERNSTEIN

(miserably)

I didn't see that.

KANE

It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm

dictating it.

BERNSTEIN

(looks at him)

I can't take shorthand.

KANE

Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish

the notice.

QUICK DISSOLVE OUT:

QUICK DISSOLVE:

BERNSTEIN

He finished it.  He wrote the worst

notice I ever read about the girl

he loved.  We ran it in every paper.

THOMPSON

(after a pause)

I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so

well of Susie's art anyway.

BERNSTEIN

(looks at him very

soberly)

He thought she was great, Mr.

Thompson.  He really believed that.

He put all his ambition on that

girl.  After she came along, he

never really cared for himself

like he used to.  Oh, I don't

blame Susie -

THOMPSON

Well, then, how could he write

that roast?  The notices in the

Kane papers were always very kind

to her.

BERNSTEIN

Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell

you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard

man to figure out.  He had that

funny sense of humor.  And then,

too, maybe he thought by finishing

that piece he could show Leland he

was an honest man.  You see, Leland

didn't think so.  I guess he showed

him all right.  He's a nice fellow,

but he's a dreamer.  They were

always together in those early

days when we just started the

Enquirer.

DISSOLVE:

CARTER

Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the

"Enquirer."  I am Herbert Carter.

KANE

Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr.

Leland.

CARTER

(bowing)

How do you do, Mr. Leland?

KANE

(pointing to the

standing reporters)

Are they standing for me?

CARTER

I thought it would be a nice gesture

the new publisher -

KANE

(grinning)

Ask them to sit down.

CARTER

You may resume your work, gentlemen.

(to Kane)

I didn't know your plans and so I

was unable to make any preparations.

KANE

I don't my plans myself.

KANE

As a matter of fact, I haven't got

any.  Except to get out a newspaper.

KANE

Oh, Mr. Bernstein!

KANE

If you would come here a moment,

please, Mr. Bernstein?

KANE

Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.

Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.

CARTER

(frigidly)

How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?

KANE

You've got a private office here,

haven't you?

CARTER

(indicating open

door to left of

platform)

My little sanctum is at your

disposal.  But I don't think I

understand -

KANE

I'm going to live right here.

(reflectively)

As long as I have to.

CARTER

But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane.

After all, we're practically closed

twelve hours a day - except for

the business offices -

KANE

That's one of the things I think

must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The

news goes on for twenty-four hours

a day.

DISSOLVE:

KANE

I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter,

but here's what I mean.  There's a

front page story in the "Chronicle,"

(points to it)

and a picture - of a woman in

Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably

murdered.

(looks to make sure

of the name)

A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why

didn't the "Enquirer" have that

this morning?

CARTER

(stiffly)

Because we're running a newspaper,

Mr.  Kane, not a scandal sheet.

KANE

I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go

to Rector's and get something

decent.

(pointing to the

"Chronicle" before

him)

The "Chronicle" has a two-column

headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't

we?

CARTER

There is no news big enough.

KANE

If the headline is big enough, it

makes the new big enough.  The

murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -

CARTER

(hotly)

As a matter of fact, we sent a man

to the Silverstone home yesterday

afternoon.

(triumphantly)

Our man even arrived before the

"Chronicle" reporter.  And there's

no proof that the woman was murdered -

or even that she's dead.

KANE

(smiling a bit)

The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's

murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the

neighbors are getting suspicious.

CARTER

(stiffly)

It's not our function to report

the gossip of housewives.  If we

were interested in that kind of

thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the

paper twice over daily -

KANE

(gently)

That's the kind of thing we are

going to be interested in from now

on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish

you'd send your best man up to see

Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell

Mr.  Silverstone if he doesn't

produce his wife at once, the

"Enquirer" will have him arrested.

(he gets an idea)

Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's

a detective from the Central Office.

If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his

badge, your man is to get indignant

and call Mr. Silverstone an

anarchist.

CARTER

Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the

function of a respectable newspaper -

KANE

Oh, Mr. Bernstein!

KANE

I've just made a shocking discovery.

The "Enquirer" is without a

telephone.  Have two installed at

once!

BERNSTEIN

I ordered six already this morning!

Got a discount!

CARTER

But, Mr. Kane -

KANE

That'll be all today, Mr. Carter.

You've been most understanding.

Good day, Mr. Carter!

LELAND

Poor Mr. Carter!

KANE

(shakes his head)

What makes those fellows think

that a newspaper is something rigid,

something inflexible, that people

are supposed to pay two cents for -

BERNSTEIN

(without looking up)

Three cents.

KANE

(calmly)

Two cents.

BERNSTEIN

(tapping on the

paper)

This is all figured at three cents

a copy.

KANE

Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at

two cents.

BERNSTEIN

(sighs and puts

papers in his pocket)

All right, but I'll keep these

figures, too, just in case.

KANE

Ready for dinner, Brad?

BERNSTEIN

Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should

decide to drop the price to one

cent, or maybe even he should make

up his mind to give the paper away

with a half-pound of tea - you'll

just hold him until I get back,

won't you?

LELAND

I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr.

Bernstein.  You people work too

fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!

BERNSTEIN

Who said anything about brooms?

KANE

It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A

new broom sweeps clean.

BERNSTEIN

Oh!

DISSOLVE:

SMATHERS

But it's impossible, Mr. Kane.  We

can't remake these pages.

KANE

These pages aren't made up as I

want them, Mr. Smathers.  We go to

press in five minutes.

CARTER

(about to crack up)

The "Enquirer" has an old and

honored tradition, Mr. Kane...

The "Enquirer" is not in competition

with those other rags.

BERNSTEIN

We should be publishing such rags,

that's all I wish.  Why, the

"Enquirer" - I wouldn't wrap up

the liver for the cat in the

"Enquirer" -

CARTER

(enraged)

Mr. Kane, I must ask you to see to

it that this - this person learns

to control his tongue.

CARTER

I've been a newspaperman my whole

life and I don't intend -

(he starts to sputter)

- if it's your intention that I

should continue to be harassed by

this - this -

(he's really sore)

I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go

against my grain to desert you

when you need me so badly - but I

would feel obliged to ask that my

resignation be accepted.

KANE

It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with

assurances of my deepest regard.

CARTER

But Mr. Kane, I meant -

KANE

(quietly)

Let's remake these pages, Mr.

Smathers.  We'll have to publish a

half hour late, that's all.

SMATHERS

(as though Kane

were talking Greek)

We can't remake them, Mr. Kane.

We go to press in five minutes.

KANE

You can remake them now, can't

you, Mr. Smathers?

KANE

After the types 've been reset and

the pages have been remade according

to the way I told you before, Mr.

Smathers, kindly have proofs pulled

and bring them to me.  Then, if I

can't find any way to improve them

again -

(almost as if

reluctantly)

- I suppose we'll have to go to

press.

BERNSTEIN

(to Smathers)

In case you don't understand, Mr.

Smathers - he's a new broom.

DISSOLVE OUT:

NEWSBOYS' VOICES

CHRONICLE!  CHRONICLE!  H'YA - THE

CHRONICLE - GET YA!  CHRONICLE!

LELAND

We'll be on the street soon, Charlie -

another ten minutes.

BERNSTEIN

(looking at his

watch)

It's three hours and fifty minutes

late - but we did it -

KANE

Tired?

LELAND

It's been a tough day.

KANE

A wasted day.

BERNSTEIN

(looking up)

Wasted?

LELAND

(incredulously)

Charlie?!

BERNSTEIN

You just made the paper over four

times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -

KANE

I've changed the front page a

little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not

enough - There's something I've

got to get into this paper besides

pictures and print -  I've got to

make the "New York Enquirer" as

important to New York as the gas

in that light.

LELAND

(quietly)

What're you going to do, Charlie?

KANE

My Declaration of Principles -

(he says it with

quotes around it)

Don't smile, Brad -

(getting the idea)

Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -

BERNSTEIN

Can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -

KANE

I'll write it myself.

BERNSTEIN

(looking over his

shoulder)

You don't wanta make any promises,

Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.

KANE

(as he writes)

These'll be kept.

(stops for a minute

and reads what he

has written; reading)

I'll provide the people of this

city with a daily paper that will

tell all the news honestly.

(starts to write

again; reading as

he writes)

will also provide them -

LELAND

That's the second sentence you've

started with "I" -

KANE

(looking up)

People are going to know who's

responsible.  And they're going to

get the news - the true news -

quickly and simply and

entertainingly.

(he speaks with

real conviction)

And no special interests will be

allowed to interfere with the truth

of that news.

DISSOLVE:

BERNSTEIN

(looking up at the

sign - happily)

Sixty-two thousand -

LELAND

That looks pretty nice.

KANE

(indicating the

Chronicle Building)

Let's hope they like it there.

BERNSTEIN

From the Chronicle Building that

sign is the biggest thing you can

see - every floor guaranteed -

let's hope it bothers them - it

cost us enough.

KANE

(pointing to the

sign over the

photograph in the

window)

Look at that.

LELAND

The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.

KANE

It's a good idea for a newspaper.

(reading the figures)

Four hundred sixy thousand.

BERNSTEIN

Say, with them fellows -

(referring to the

photo)

- it's no trick to get circulation.

KANE

You're right, Mr. Bernstein.

BERNSTEIN

(sighs)

You know how long it took the

"Chronicle" to get that staff

together?  Twenty years.

KANE

I know.

DISSOLVE:

PHOTOGRAPHER

That's all.  Thank you.

KANE

(a sudden thought)

Make up an extra copy and mail it

to the "Chronicle."

KANE

Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This

has, I think, been a fitting welcome

to those distinguished journalists -

(indicates the eight

men)

Mr. Reilly in particular - who are

the latest additions to our ranks.

It will make them happy to learn

that the "Enquirer's" circulation

this morning passed the two hundred

thousand mark.

BERNSTEIN

Two hundred and one thousand, six

hundred and forty-seven.

KANE

All of you - new and old -  You're

all getting the best salaries in

town.  Not one of you has been

hired because of his loyalty.

It's your talent I'm interested

in.  That talent that's going to

make the "Enquirer" the kind of

paper I want - the best newspaper

in the world!

KANE

However, I think you'll agree we've

heard enough about newspapers and

the newspaper business for one

night.  There are other subjects

But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy

I promise not to bring any more

Goodbye, gents!

Hey!

You don't expect me to keep any of

So then, tonight, we go over

Especially the new papers -

KANE

We certainly do.  Vacation's over -

starting right after dinner.  But

right now - that lady over there -

(he indicates a

woman at the desk)

- that's the new society editor, I

take it?  You think I could

interrupt her a moment, Mr.

Bernstein?

BERNSTEIN

Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been

away so long I forgot about your

joking -

BERNSTEIN

Miss Townsend -

MISS TOWNSEND

Good afternoon, Mr. Bernstein.

BERNSTEIN

This is Mr. Kane, Miss Townsend.

KANE

(very hesitatingly

and very softly)

Miss Townsend -

KANE

I've been away for several months,

and I don't know exactly how these

things are handled now.  But one

thing I wanted to be sure of is

that you won't treat this little

announcement any differently than

you would any other similar

announcement.

KANE

(gently)

Read it, Miss Townsend.  And

remember - just the regular

treatment!  See you at nine o'clock,

Mr. Bernstein!

MISS TOWNSEND

(reading)

Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton

announce the engagement of their

daughter, Emily Monroe Norton, to

Mr.  Charles Foster Kane.

BERNSTEIN

(starts to read it)

Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton

announce -

MISS TOWNSEND

(fluttering - on

top of him)

She's - she's the niece of - of

the President of the United States -

BERNSTEIN

(nodding proudly)

know.  Come on, Miss Townsend -

From the window, maybe we can get

a look.

BERNSTEIN

A girl like that, believe me, she's

lucky!  Presiden't niece, huh!

Say, before he's through, she'll

be a Presiden't wife.

DISSOLVE:

BERNSTEIN

The way things turned out, I don't

was no rosebud!

THOMPSON

It didn't end very well, did it?

BERNSTEIN

(shaking his head)

It ended -

(a slight pause)

Then there was Susie - that ended,

too.

(shrugs, a pause;

then looking up

into Thompson's

eyes)

guess he didn't make her very happy -

(A PAUSE)

You know, I was thinking - that

Rosebud you're trying to find out

about -

THOMPSON

Yes -

BERNSTEIN

Maybe that was something he lost.

Mr. Kane was a man that lost -

almost everything he had -

(a pause)

You ought to talk to Bradford

Leland.  He could tell you a lot.

I wish I could tell you where Leland

is, but I don't know myself.  He

may be out of town somewhere - he

may be dead.

THOMPSON

In case you'd like to know, Mr.

Bernstein, he's at the Huntington

Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.

BERNSTEIN

You don't say!  Why I had no idea -

THOMPSON

Nothing particular the matter with

him, they tell me.  Just -

(controls himself)

BERNSTEIN

Just old age.

(smiles sadly)

It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson,

you don't look forward to being

cured of.

(pauses)

You ought to see Mr. Leland.

There's a whole lot of things he

could tell you - if he wanted to.

FADE OUT:

LELAND'S VOICE

When you get to my age, young man,

you don't miss anything.  Unless

maybe it's a good drink of bourbon.

Even that doesn't make much

difference, if you remember there

hasn't been any good bourbon in

this country for twenty years.

THOMPSON

Mr. Leland, you were -

LELAND

You don't happen to have a cigar,

do you?  I've got a young physician -

must remember to ask to see his

license - the odds are a hundred

to one he hasn't got one - who

thinks I'm going to stop smoking...

I changed the subject, didn't I?

Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable

old man I've become.  You want to

know what I think of Charlie Kane?

Well - I suppose he has some private

sort of greatness.  But he kept it

to himself.

(grinning)

He never - gave himself away -  He

never gave anything away.  He just -

left you a tip.  He had a generous

mind.  I don't suppose anybody

ever had so many opinions.  That

was because he had the power to

express them, and Charlie lived on

power and the excitement of using

it -  But he didn't believe in

anything except Charlie Kane.  He

never had a conviction in his life.

I guess he died without one -

That must have been pretty

unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of

us check out with no special

conviction about death.  But we do

know what we're leaving ... we

believe in something.

(looks sharply at

Thompson)

You're absolutely sure you haven't

got a cigar?

THOMPSON

Sorry, Mr. Leland.

LELAND

Never mind -  Bernstein told you

about the first days at the office,

didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a

bad newspaper man even then.  He

entertained his readers, but he

never told them the truth.

THOMPSON

Maybe you could remember something

that -

LELAND

I can remember everything.  That's

my curse, young man.  It's the

greatest curse that's ever been

inflicted on the human race.  Memory -

I was his oldest friend.

(slowly)

As far as I was concerned, he

behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt'

his friend.  If I wasn't, he never

had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays

you call a stooge -

DISSOLVE OUT:

KANE'S VOICE

Not one of you has been hired

because of his loyalty.  It's your

world!

BERNSTEIN

Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!

LELAND

Yes.

KANE'S VOICE

However, I think you'll agree we've

heard enough about newspapers and

the newspaper business for one

night.

BERNSTEIN

(to Leland)

What's the matter?

LELAND

Mr. Bernstein, these men who are

now with the "Enquirer" - who were

with the "Chronicle" until yesterday -

weren't they just as devoted to

the "Chronicle" kind of paper as

they are now to - our kind of paper?

BERNSTEIN

Sure.  They're like anybody else.

They got work to do.  They do it.

(proudly)

Only they happen to be the best

men in the business.

KANE

(finishing his speech)

There are other subjects in the

world -

LELAND

(after a minute)

Do we stand for the same things

that the "Chronicle" stands for,

Mr. Bernstein?

BERNSTEIN

(indignantly)

Certainly not.  So what's that got

to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll

have them changed to his kind of

newspapermen in a week.

LELAND

Probably.  There's always a chance,

of course, that they'll change Mr.

Kane - without his knowing it.

KANE

Well, gentlemen, are we going to

war?

LELAND

Our readers are, anyway, I don't

know about the rest of the country.

KANE

(enthusiastically)

It'll be our first foreign war in

fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it

the way the "Hickville Gazette"

covers the church social!  The

names of everybody there; what

they wore; what they ate; who won

the prizes; who gave the prizes -

(gets excited)

I tell you, Brad, I envy you.

I'm almost tempted -

LELAND

But there is no Front, Charlie.

There's a very doubtful civil war.

Besides, I don't want the job.

KANE

All right, Brad, all right - you

don't have to be a war correspondent

unless you want to - I'd want to.

(looking up)

Hello, Georgie.

GEORGIE

Is everything the way you want it,

dear?

KANE

(looking around)

If everybody's having fun, that's

the way I want it.

GEORGIE

I've got some other little girls

coming over -

LELAND

(interrupting)

Charles, I tell you there is no

war!  There's a condition that

should be remedied - but between

that and a -

KANE

(seriously)

How would the "Enquirer" look with

no news about this non-existent

war - with Benton, Pulitzer and

Heart devoting twenty columns a

day to it?

LELAND

They do it only because you do!

KANE

(grins)

And I do it because they do it,

and they do it - it's a vicious

circle, isn't it?

(rises)

I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad -

you know, Georgie, don't you?

GEORGIE

(over Kane's next

lines)

Glad to meet you, Brad.

KANE

I told you about Brad, Georgie.

He needs to relax.

KANE

Some ships with wonderful wines

have managed to slip through the

enemy fleet that's blockading New

York harbor -

(grins)

Georgie knows a young lady whom

I'm sure you'd adore - wouldn't

he, Georgie?  Why only the other

evening I said to myself, if Brad

were only here to adore this young

lady - this -

(snaps his fingers)

What's her name again?

DISSOLVE OUT:

GEORGIE

(right on cue from

preceding scene)

Ethel - this gentlemen has been

very anxious to meet you -  This

is Ethel.

ETHEL

Hello, Mr. Leland.

ONE OF THE GIRLS

Charlie!  Play the song about you.

ANOTHER GIRL

Is there a song about Charlie?

KANE

Say, Brad.

(draws him slightly

aside)

I've got an idea.

LELAND

Yes?

KANE

I mean I've got a job for you.

LELAND

Good.

KANE

You don't want to be a war

correspondent - how about being a

dramatic critic?

LELAND

(sincerely, but not

gushing; seriously)

I'd like that.

KANE

You start tomorrow night.  Richard

Carl in "The Spring Chicken."

(or supply show)

I'll get us some girls.  You get

tickets.  A drama critic gets them

free, you know.

(grins)

Rector's at seven?

LELAND

Charlie -

KANE

Yes?

LELAND

(still smiling)

It doesn't make any difference

about me, but one of these days

you're going to find out that all

this charm of yours won't be enough -

KANE

(has stopped dancing)

You're wrong.  It does make a

difference to you -  Rector's,

Brad?

(starts to dance

again)

Come to think of it, I don't blame

you for not wanting to be a war

correspondent.  You won't miss

anything.  It isn't much of a war.

Besides, they tell me there isn't

a decent restaurant on the whole

island.

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE:

KANE

You don't expect me to keep any of

those promises, do you?

BERNSTEIN

(turns to Leland)

Do you, Mr. Leland?

LELAND

(smiling)

Certainly not.

BERNSTEIN

Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to

Europe with him?  He wanted you

to.  He said to me just yesterday -

LELAND

I wanted him to have fun - and

with me along -

LELAND

Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me

ask you a few questions, and answer

me truthfully.

BERNSTEIN

Don't I always?  Most of the time?

LELAND

Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?

Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am

I a New England school-marm?

BERNSTEIN

Yes.

BERNSTEIN

If you thought I'd answer different

from what Mr. Kane tells you -

well, I wouldn't.

LELAND

(good naturedly)

You're in a conspiracy against me,

you two.  You always have been.

BERNSTEIN

Against me there should be such a

conspiracy some time!

BERNSTEIN

(with a hopeful

look in his eyes)

Well, he'll be coming back in

September.  The Majestic.  I got

the reservations.  It gets in on

the ninth.

LELAND

September the ninth?

DISSOLVE:

LELAND

I used to go to dancing school

with her.

LELAND

What's this?

THOMPSON

It's a letter from her lawyers.

LELAND

(reading aloud from

the letter)

David, Grobleski & Davis -  My

dear Rawlston -

(looks up)

THOMPSON

Rawlston is my boss.

LELAND

Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.

THOMPSON

He knows the first Mrs. Kane

socially -  That's the answer we

got.

LELAND

(reading)

I am in receipt of your favor of

yesterday.  I beg you to do me the

courtesy of accepting my assurance

that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be

induced to contribute any more

information on the career of Charles

Foster Kane.

LELAND

Brief marriage!  Ten years!

(sighs)

THOMPSON

Was he in love?

LELAND

He married for love -

(a little laugh)

That's why he did everything.

That's why he went into politics.

It seems we weren't enough.  He

wanted all the voters to love him,

too.  All he really wanted out of

life was love.  That's Charlie's

story - it's the story of how he

lost it.  You see, he just didn't

have any to give.  He loved Charlie

Kane, of course, very dearly - and

his mother, I guess he always loved

her.  As for Emily - well, all I

can tell you is Emily's story as

she told it to me, which probably

isn't fair - there's supposed to

be two sides to every story - and

I guess there are.  I guess there's

more than two sides -

DISSOLVE OUT:

THE PRESIDENT

It is the unanimous opinion of my

Cabinent - in which I concur -

that the proposed leases are in

the best interests of the

Governement and the people.

(pauses)

You are not, I hope, suggesting

that these interests are not

indentical?

KANE

I'm not suggesting anything, Mr.

President!  I've come here to tell

you that, unless some action is

taken promptly - and you are the

only one who can take it - the oil

that is the property of the people

of this country will be turned

over for a song to a gang of high-

pressure crooks!

THE PRESIDENT

(calmly)

I must refuse to allow you to

continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.

KANE

(screaming)

It's the only vein I know.  I tell

the facts the way I see them.  And

any man that knows that facts -

THE PRESIDENT

I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I

happen to have the incredible

insolence to differ with you as to

what they mean.

(pause)

You're a man of great talents, Mr.

Kane.

KANE

Thanks.

THE PRESIDENT

I understand that you have political

ambitions.  Unfortunately, you

seem incapable of allowing any

other opinion but your own -

KANE

(building to a frenzy)

I'm much obliged, Mr. President,

for your concern about me.  However,

I happen to be concerned at this

moment with the matter of extensive

oil lands belonging to the people

of the United States, and I say

that if this lease goes through,

the property of the people of the

United States goes into the hands

of -

THE PRESIDENT

(interrupting)

You've made your point perfectly

clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.

KANE

Mr. President.

DISSOLVE:

FOREMAN

How about it, Mr. Kane?

KANE

All right.  Let her slide!

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE:

REILLY

Looks bad for us, Mr. Kane.  How

shall we handle it?

DISSOLVE OUT:

KANE

It's a news story!  Get it on the

street!

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE:

KANE

(to Reilly)

Take dictation -  Front page

editorial -  "This afternoon a

great man was assassinated.  He

was the President of the United

States -"

LELAND

Charlie -

KANE

Yes?

LELAND

Do you think you're the one who

should call him a great man?

KANE

Why not?

LELAND

Why not?  Well - nobody's a great

man in your estimation until he's

dead.

REILLY

(quickly)

Maybe we'd better wait for more

word on the President's condition.

KANE

(still looking at

Leland)

What do you mean by that?

LELAND

(quietly)

Competition.

REILLY

He may recover -

KANE

(still holding on

Leland)

What do you mean by that?

LELAND

(steadily)

Yesterday morning you called the

President a traitor.  What do you

think that crowd is doing down

there?  They think you murdered

him.

KANE

Because the crackpot who did it

had a copy of the "Enquirer" in

his pocket?

LELAND

- and that copy of the "Enquirer"

said the President should be killed.

KANE

I said treason was a capital offense

punishable by death -

LELAND

You've said a lot of things about

the President in the last few

months.

KANE

They're true!  Everything I said!

Witholding that veto was treason!

LELAND

(interrupting)

Charlie!

KANE

(riding over him)

Oil belonging to the people of the

United States was leased out for a

song to a gang of high-pressure

crooks -  Nobody can blame me

because -

LELAND

Look out that window.

LELAND

There are the people of the United

States, and they are blaming you -

Oh, I know it doesn't make any

sense, but at least you can learn

a lesson from it.

KANE

(snarling)

What lesson?  Not to expose fraud

when I see it?  Not to fight for

the right of the people to own

their own property?

(he turns to Reilly)

Run it the way I said, Reilly -

"This afternoon a great man was

assassinated -"

LELAND

Charlie!  Now you're not making

sense.

KANE

(sharply)

I don't have to.  I run a newspaper

with half a million readers and

they're getting a martyred president

this morning with their breakfast.

I can't help that.  Besides, they

all know I'm married to his niece.

I've got to think of her.

LELAND

What?

KANE

I've got to think of Emily -

LELAND

(after a silence)

I'd like to talk to you about that.

KANE

Go ahead.

LELAND

Finish your editorial.

LELAND

(worried)

What's happened?

BERNSTEIN

(smiling)

I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only

there was some fellows out front

that thought they ought to take

things up with me.  I learned 'em!

Didn't I, officer?

THE COP

(grinning)

You sure did -  Say, the

Commissioner said I was to stand

by and protect Mr. Kane until

further orders, no matter how he

felt about it.  Where is he?

LELAND

(finishing his drink)

In there.

BERNSTEIN

If you hadn't come along and

protected me when you did, I'd

have killed them fellows.

LELAND

(pouring himself

another drink)

Go and get yourself washed up, Mr.

Bernstein.

(he looks his face

over thoroughly)

There doesn't seem to be an serious

injury.

BERNSTEIN

Not to me.  But you will let that

cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't

you?

LELAND

Yes, Mr. Bernstein.

DISSOLVE:

REILLY

(as they go)

Goodnight, Mr. Kane.

LELAND

First of all -

(he can't go on)

KANE

(not cruelly -

genuinely kind)

What's wrong, Brad?

LELAND

I'm drunk.

KANE

I'll get you some coffee.

LELAND

First of all, I will not write a

good review of a play because

somebody paid a thousand dollars

for an advertisement in the

"Enquirer."

KANE

(gently - opening

the door)

That's just a little promotion

scheme.  Nobody expects you -

(calling)

Mike, will you try and get Mr.

Leland some coffee?

MIKE'S VOICE

Sure thing, Mr. Kane.

LELAND

Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't

agree anymore.  I wish you'd let

me go to Chicago.

KANE

Why, Brad?

LELAND

I want to be transferred to the

new paper.  You've been saying

yourself you wish you had somebody

to -

(he is heartsick,

inarticulate)

That's not what I wanted to talk

about.

KANE

I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad -

I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll

help.

LELAND

No, that won't help.  Besides, you

never get drunk.  I wanted to talk

about you and Emily.

KANE

(quietly)

All right.

LELAND

(without looking at

him)

She's going to leave you -

KANE

I don't think so, Brad.  We've

just had word that the President

is out of danger.

(ruefully)

It seems I didn't kill him after

all.

LELAND

(takes his eye)

She was going to leave you anyway -

LELAND

Emily's going south next week with

the child.  As far as anybody's to

know, it's a holiday.  When they

get back -

KANE

(sharply)

Brad, you are drunk.

LELAND

Sure I am.  She wants full custody

of the child no matter what happens.

If you won't agree to that, she'll

apply for a divorce regardless of

the President's wishes.  I can't

tell her she's wrong, because she

isn't wrong -

KANE

Why is she leaving me?

LELAND

(it's very hard for

him to say all

this)

She hasn't any friends left sine

you started this oil business, and

she never sees you.

KANE

Do you think the "Enquirer"

shouldn't have campaigned against

the oil leases?

LELAND

(hesitating)

You might have made the whole thing

less personal!

LELAND

It isn't just that the President

was her uncle - everyone she knows,

all the people she's been brought

up with, everything she's ever

been taught to believe is important -

LELAND

There's no reason why this - this

savage personal note -

KANE

The personal note is all there is

to it.  It's all there ever is to

it.  It's all there every is to

anything!  Stupidity in our

government, complacency and self-

satisfaction and unwillingness to

believe that anything done by a

certain class of people can be

wrong - you can't fight those things

impersonally.  They're not

impersonal crimes against people.

They're being done by actual persons -

with actual names and positions

and - the right of the American

people to own their own country is

not an academic issue, Brad, that

you debate - and then the judges

retire to return a verdict and the

winners give a dinner for the

losers.

LELAND

You almost convince me.

(rising)

I'm just drunk enough to tell you

the truth.  I have to be a little

drunk for that because I'm a coward.

You know that.  That's why you

keep me around.

(smiles)

You only associate with your

inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's

why you ran away from Emily.

Because you can't stand the company

of your equals.  You don't like to

admit they exist - the other big

people in your world are dead.

I told you that.

LELAND

You talk about the people of the

United States as though they

belonged to you.  When you find

out they don't think they are,

you'll lose interest.  You talk

about giving them their rights as

though you could make a present of

liberty.  Remember the working

man?  You used to defend him quite

a good deal.  Well, he's turning

into something called organized

labor and you don't like that at

all.  And listen, when your precious

underprivileged really get together -

that's going to add up to something

bigger than - than your privilege

and then I don't know what you'll

do - sail away to a desert island,

probably, and lord it over the

monkeys.

KANE

Are you finished?

LELAND

Yes.

(looking down)

Now, will you let me go to Chicago?

KANE

(with a little smile)

You're not going to like it in

Chicago.  They wind comes howling

in from the lake.  And there's

practically no opera season at all -

and the Lord only knows whether

they've ever heard of Lobster

Newburg -

LELAND

That's all right.

(he won't be charmed

out of his duty)

What are you going to do about

Emily?

KANE

(his face hardning

a little)

Nothing - if she dosen't love me -

LELAND

You want love on your own terms,

don't you, Charlie -

(he stops - his

back turned to

Kane)

Love according to your own rules.

And if anything goes wrong and

you're hurt - then the game stops,

and you've got to be soothed and

nursed, no matter what else is

happening - and no matter who else

is hurt!

KANE

It's simpler than that, Brad.  A

society girl can't stand the gaff,

that's all.  Other things are

important to her - social position,

what they're saying on the front

porches at Southampton, is it going

to be embarrassing to meet somebody

or the other at dinner -

KANE

She can leave me.  As a matter of

fact, I've already left her.  Don't

worry, Brad - I'll live.

LELAND

I know you will.

KANE

(with all his charm)

Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an

awful lot tonight - let's have

another brandy.

KANE

To love on my terms.  Those are

the only terms anybody knows ...

his own.

DISSOLVE:

A VOICE FROM THE CROWD

You moiderer!

KANE

Are you hurt?

LELAND

No.  I wish you'd go home to Emily.

She'll be pretty upset by all this -

She still loves you -

KANE

You still want to be transferred

to the other paper?

LELAND

Yes.

KANE

(leaning out of the

hansom cab)

Well, you've been getting a pretty

low salary here in New York.  It

seems to me that the new dramatic

critic of our Chicago paper should

get what he's worth.

(almost as a question)

LELAND

(with handkerchief

still attached to

his face)

I couldn't possibly live on as

little as that, Charlie.  We'll

let the salary stay where it is.

DISSOLVE OUT:

KANE

(to the nurse)

Excuse us a moment, please.

KANE

(peremptorily)

I said, excuse us a moment.

KANE

I've been talking to Leland.  Emily -

You can't leave me now - not now -

KANE

It isn't what it would do to my

changes in politics, Emily -  That

isn't it -  They were talking of

running me for governor, but now,

of course, we'll have to wait -

It isn't that, Emily -  It's just -

the president is your uncle and

they're saying I killed him.

KANE

That story about the murderer having

a copy of the "Enquirer" in his

pocket - the "Chronicle" made that

up out of whole cloth -  Emily,

please - He's going to be all right,

you know, he's going to recover -

(bitterly)

If it will make you any happier,

we had nine pages of advertising

cancelled in the first mail this

morning.  Bernstein is afraid to

open any more letters.  He -

KANE

(exasperated)

What do you expect me to do?  What

in the world -

EMILY

(weakly)

Charles.

EMILY

Do you really think -

(she can't continue)

Those threatening letters, can

they really -

KANE

(uncomfortably)

They won't do anything to Junior,

darling.

(contemptuously)

Anonymous letter writers -   I've

got guards in front of the house,

and I'm going to arrange -

EMILY

(turning her face

toward him)

Please don't talk any more, Charles.

EMILY

Have they heard from father yet?

Has he seen -

KANE

I've tried to tell you, Emily.

The President's going to be all

right.  He had a comfortable night.

There's no danger of any kind.

EMILY

(murmuring)

Here I am, darling...  Darling!...

Darling, it's all right...  Mother's

here.

KANE

Emily - you musn't leave me now -

you can't do that to me.

EMILY

They won't hurt you, darling.

Mother's with you!  Mother's looking

after you!

DISSOLVE OUT:

KANE

We'll withdraw support completely.

Anything else?

REILLY

Mr. Leland sent back that check.

KANE

What check?

REILLY

You made it out to him last week

after he left for Chicago.

KANE

Oh, yes, the bonus.

REILLY

It was for twenty-five thousand

dollars.

REILLY

He sent it back torn up - all torn

up into little bits, and he enclosed

something else -  I can't make it

out.

REILLY

It says here, "A Declaration of

Principles" -

(he still reads)

"I will provide the people of this

city with a daily paper that will

tell all the news honestly" -

DISSOLVE:

KANE

It is no secret that I entered

upon this campaign with no thought

that I could be elected Governor

of this state!  It is now no secret

that every straw vote, every

independent pole, shows that I

will be elected.  And I repeat to

you - my first official act as

Governor will be to appoint a

special District Attorney to arrange

for the indictment, prosecution

and conviction of Boss Edward G.

Rogers!

DISSOLVE OUT:

FIRST CIVIC LEADER

Great speech, Mr. Kane.

SECOND LEADER

(pompous)

One of the most notable public

utterances ever made by a candidate

in this state -

KANE

Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you.

REILLY

A wonderful speech, Mr. Kane.

REILLY

I just got word from Buffalo, Mr.

Kane.  They're going to throw you

the organization vote - and take a

chance maybe you'll give them a

break -

REILLY

On an independent ticket there's

never been anything like it!  If

the election were held today, you'd

be elected by a hundred thousand

votes - and every day between now

and November 7th is just going to

add to your majority.

KANE

It does seem too good to be true,

doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?

REILLY

Rogers isn't even pretending.  He

isn't just scared anymore.  He's

sick.  Frank Norris told me last

night he hasn't known Rogers to be

that worried in twenty-five years.

KANE

I think it's beginning to dawn on

Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say.

With Mr. Rogers out of the way,

Reilly, I think we may really begin

to hope for a good government in

this state.

(stopping)

Well, Mr. Bernstein?

BERNSTEIN

(clearly not meaning

it)

It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.

Wonderful.  Wonderful.

KANE

You don't really think so?

BERNSTEIN

I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're

running for Governor - and you

want to be elected -  I think it's

wonderful you're going to be

elected.  Only -

(interrupts himself)

-  Can I say something?

KANE

Please, Mr. Bernstein.

BERNSTEIN

Well, the way I look at it -

(comes out with it)

-  You want to know what I really

think would be wonderful?

BERNSTEIN

Well, you're running for Governor

and going to be elected - my idea

is how wonderful it would be if

you don't run at all and don't get

elected.

DISSOLVE:

JUNIOR

Is Pop Governor yet, Mom?

KANE

Hello, Butch!  Did you like your

old man's speech?

JUNIOR

Hello, Pop!  I was in a box.  I

could hear every word.

KANE

I saw you!

(he has his arm

around Junior's

shoulder)

Good night, gentlemen.

EMILY

I'm sending Junior home in the

car, Charles - with Oliver -

KANE

But I'd arranged to go home with

you myself.

EMILY

There's a call I want you to make

with me, Charles.

KANE

It can wait.

EMILY

No, it can't.

(she bends down and

kisses Junior)

Good night, darling.

JUNIOR

Good night, Mom.

KANE

(as car starts to

drive off)

What's this all about, Emily?

I've had a very tiring day and -

EMILY

It may not be about anything at

all.

THE DRIVER

Cab?

EMILY

I intend to find out.

KANE

I insist on being told exactly

what you have in mind.

EMILY

I'm going to -

(she looks at a

slip of paper in

her hand)

- 185 West 74th Street.

EMILY

If you wish, you can come with

me...

KANE

I'll go with you.

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE:

KANE

I had no idea you had this flair

for melodrama, Emiliy.

THE MAID

Come in, Mr. Kane, come in.

SUSAN

It wasn't my fault, Charlie.  He

made me send your wife a note.

He said I'd - oh, he's been saying

the most terrible things, I didn't

know what to do...  I -

(she catches sight

of Emily)

ROGERS

Good evening, Mr. Kane.

(he rises)

I don't suppose anybody would

introduce us.  Mrs. Kane, I am

Edward Rogers.

EMILY

How do you do?

(pauses)

I came here - and I made Mr. Kane

come with me...

(she consults the

note in her hand

without reading it

again)

because I recieved this note -

ROGERS

I made Miss - Miss Alexander send

you the note.  She was a little

unwilling at first -

(he smiles grimly)

but she did it.

SUSAN

I can't tell you the things he

said, Charlie.  You haven't got

any idea -

KANE

(turning on Rogers)

Rogers, I don't think I will

postpone doing something about you

until I'm elected.

(he starts toward

him)

To start with, I'll break your

neck.

ROGERS

(not giving way an

inch)

Maybe you can do it and maybe you

can't, Mr. Kane.

EMILY

Charles!

(he stops to look

at her)

Your - your breaking this man's

neck -

(she is clearly

disgusted)

would scarcely explain this note -

(glancing at the

note)

Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -

(slowly)

for myself, and for my son.  What

does this note mean, Miss -

SUSAN

(stiffly)

I'm Susan Alexander.

(pauses)

I know what you think, Mrs. Kane,

but -

EMILY

(ignoring this)

What does this note mean, Miss

Alexander?

ROGERS

She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She

just sent it - because I made her

see it wouldn't be smart for her

not to send it.

KANE

In case you don't know, Emily,

this - this gentleman -

(he puts a world of

scorn into the

word)

is -

ROGERS

I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane,

and your husband is just trying to

be funny calling me one.  I don't

even know what a gentleman is.

(tensely, with all

the hatred and

venom in the world)

You see, my idea of a gentleman,

Mrs.  Kane - well, if I owned a

newspaper and if I didn't like the

way somebody else was doing things -

some politican, say - I'd fight

them with everything I had.  Only

I wouldn't show him in a convict

suit, with stripes - so his children

could see the picture in the paper.

Or his mother.

(he has to control

himself from hurling

himself at Kane)

It's pretty clear - I'm not a

gentleman.

EMILY

Oh!!

KANE

You're a cheap, crooked grafter -

and your concern for your children

and your mother -

ROGERS

Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only

we're talking now about what you

are.  That's what the note is about,

Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay

all my cards on the table.  I'm

fighting for my life.  Not just my

political life.  My life.  If your

husband is elected governor -

KANE

I'm going to be elected governor.

And the first thing I'm going to

do -

EMILY

Let him finish, Charles.

ROGERS

I'm protecting myself every way I

know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last

week, I finally found out how I

can stop your husband from being

elected.  If the people of this

state learn what I found out this

week, he wouldn't have a chance to -

he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.

Well, what I'm interested in is

seeing that he's not elected.  I

don't care whether they know what

I know about him.  Let him keep

right on being the Great, Noble,

Moral -

(he stresses the

world)

Champeen of the people.  Just as

long as -

EMILY

I think I understand, Mr. Rogers,

but wonder if -

(she leaves her

sentence unfinished)

KANE

You can't blackmail me, Rogers,

you can't -

SUSAN

(excitedly)

Charlie, he said, unless you

withdrew your name -

ROGERS

That's the chance I'm willing to

give you, Mr. Kane.  More of a

chance than you'd give me.  Unless

you make up your mind by tomorrow

that you're so sick that you've

got to go away for a year or two -

Monday morning every paper in this

State will carry the story I'm

going to give them.

EMILY

What story, Mr. Rogers?

ROGERS

The story about him and Miss

Alexander, Mrs. Kane.

SUSAN

There is no story.  It's all lies.

Mr. Kane is just -

ROGERS

(to Susan)

Shut up!

(to Kane)

I've had a dozen men doing nothing

but run this thing down - we've

got evidence enough to - well, the

evidence would stand up in any

court of law.  You want me to give

you the evidence, Mr. Kane?

KANE

You do anything you want to do.

The people of this state can decide

which one of us to trust.  If you

want to know, they've already

decided.  The election Tuesday'll

be only -

ROGERS

Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to

believe me.  I'd like to show you -

EMILY

You don't have to show me anything,

Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.

ROGERS

I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without

having to get the story published.

Not that I care about him.  But

I'd be better off that way -

(he pauses)

- and so would you, Mrs. Kane.

SUSAN

What about me?

(to Kane)

He said my name'd be dragged through

the mud.  He said everywhere I'd

go from now on -

EMILY

There seems to be only one decision

you can make, Charles.  I'd say

that it has been made for you.

(pauses)

I suppose the details can be

arranged tomorrow, Mr. Rogers.

About the statements by the doctors -

KANE

Have you gone completely mad, Emily?

KANE

You don't think I'm going to let

this blackmailer intimidate me, do

you?

EMILY

I don't see what else you can do,

Charles.  If he's right - and the

papers publish this story he has -

KANE

Oh, they'll publish it all right.

But that's not going to stop me -

EMILY

Charles, this - this story - doesn't

concern only you.  I'll be in it,

too, won't I?

(quickly)

And Junior?

KANE

(squirming a bit)

I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid

of the story.  You can't tell me

that the voters of this state -

EMILY

I'm not interested in the voters

of this state right now.  I am

interested in - well, Junior, for

one thing.

SUSAN

Charlie!  If they publish this

story -

EMILY

They won't.  Goodnight, Mr. Rogers.

(she starts out)

There's nothing more to be said,

Charles.

KANE

Oh yes, there is.

EMILY

I don't think so.  Are you coming,

Charles?

KANE

No.

KANE

There's only one person in the

world to decide what I'm going to

do - and that's me.  And if

you think - if any of you think -

EMILY

You decided what you were going to

do, Charles - some time ago.

(she looks at Susan)

You can't always have it your own

way, regardless of anything else

that may have happened.

(she sighs)

Come on, Charles.

KANE

Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this

thing all alone!

ROGERS

You're making a bigger fool of

yourself than I thought you would,

Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why

don't you -

KANE

(turning on him)

Get out!  I've got nothing to talk

to you about.  If you want to see

me, have the Warden write me a

letter.

ROGERS

I see!

(he starts toward

the door)

SUSAN

(starting to cry)

Charlie, you're just excited.  You

don't realize -

KANE

I know exactly what I'm doing.

(he is screaming)

Get out!

EMILY

(quietly)

Charles, if you don't listen to

reason, it may be too late -

KANE

Too late for what?  Too late for

you and this -

(he can't find the

adjective)

this public thief to take the love

of the people of this state away

from me?  Well, you won't do it, I

tell you.  You won't do it!

SUSAN

Charlie, there are other things to

think of.

(a sly look comes

into her eyes)

Your son - you don't want him to

read in the papers -

EMILY

It is too late now, Charles.

KANE

(rushes to the door

and opens it)

Get out, both of you!

SUSAN

(rushes to him)

Charlie, please don't -

KANE

What are you waiting here for?

Why don't you go?

EMILY

Goodnight, Charles.

ROGERS

You're the greatest fool I've ever

known, Kane.  If it was anybody

else, I'd say what's going to happen

to you would be a lesson to you.

Only you're going to need more

than one lesson.  And you're going

to get more than one lesson.

(he walks past Kane)

KANE

Don't you worry about me.  I'm

Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap,

crooked politician, trying to save

himself from the consequences of

his crimes -

KANE

(screams louder)

I'm going to send you to Sing Sing,

Rogers.  Sing Sing!

Hello, Brad -

LELAND

Emily -

EMILY

I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad -

didn't -

LELAND

Chicago is pretty close to New

York nowadays - only twenty hours -

LELAND

I'm glad to see you.

EMILY

Are all the returns in?

EMILY

Let me see it.

LELAND

(after a pause)

Almost two to one -

EMILY

I'm surprised he got the votes he

did.

LELAND

Emily!

EMILY

Why should anyone vote for him?

He's made it quite clear to the

people what he thinks of them.

Children - to be told one thing

one day, something else the next,

as the whim seizes him.  And they're

supposed to be grateful and love

and adore him - because he sees to

it that they get cheap ice and

only pay a nickel in the street

cars.

LELAND

Emily, you're being - a little

unfair -  You know what I think of

Charles' behavior - about your

personal lives -

EMILY

There aren't any personal lives

for people like us.  He made that

very clear to me nine years ago -

If I'd thought of my life with

Charles as a personal life, I'd

have left him then -

LELAND

know that, Emily -

EMILY

(on top of Leland)

Maybe I should have - the first

time he showed me what a mad dog

he really was.

LELAND

(on the cue "dog")

Emily, you -

EMILY

Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman

yet -

LELAND

It's - all over -

EMILY

(after a pause)

Know it is, Brad -

LELAND

He's paying for it, Emily.  Those

returns tonight - he's finished.

Politically -

(he thinks)

- socially, everywhere, I guess.

don't know about the papers, but -

EMILY

If you're asking me to sympathize

with him, Brad, you're wasting

your time.

There's only one person I'm sorry

Where is it - where's my notice?

I've got to finish it!

BERNSTEIN

Mr. Kane is finishing it.

LELAND

Kane?  Charlie?

(painfully, he rises

to his feet)

Where is he?

LELAND

I suppose he's fixing it up - I

know I'd never get that through.

BERNSTEIN

(moving to his side)

Mr. Kane is finishing your piece

the way you started it.

BERNSTEIN

He's writing a roast like you wanted

it to be -

(then suddnely -

with a kind of

quiet passion rather

than a triumph)

- I guess that'll show you.

KANE

Hello, Brad.

LELAND

Hello, Charlie -

(ANOTHER PAUSE)

I didn't know we were speaking.

KANE

Sure, we're speaking, Brad -

you're fired.

DISSOLVE OUT:

LELAND

Well, that's about all there is -

and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!

(pause)

Five years ago, he wrote from that

place of his down South -

(as if trying to

think)

- you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?

(pauses)

Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of

that place?  You know...  All right.

Xanadu.  I knew what it was all

the time.  You caught on, didn't

you?

THOMPSON

Yes.

LELAND

I guess maybe I'm not as hard to

see through as I think.  Anyway, I

never even answered his letter.

Maybe I should have.  I guess he

was pretty lonely down there those

last years.  He hadn't finished it

when she left him - he never

finished it - he never finished

anything.  Of course, he built it

for her -

THOMPSON

That must have been love.

LELAND

I don't know.  He was disappointed

in the world.  So he built one of

his own -  An absolute monarchy -

It was something bigger than an

opera house anyway -

(calls)

Nurse!

(lowers his voice)

Say, I'll tell you one thing you

can do for me, young fellow.

THOMPSON

Sure.

LELAND

On your way out, stop at a cigar

store, will you, and send me up a

couple of cigars?

THOMPSON

Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad

to.

LELAND

Hey, Nurse!

NURSE

Hello, Mr. Leland.

LELAND

I'm ready to go in now.  You know

when I was a young man, there was

an impression around that nurses

were pretty.  It was no truer then

than it is now.

NURSE

Here, let me take your arm, Mr.

Leland.

LELAND

(testily)

All right, all right.

(he has begun to

move forward on

the Nurse's arm;

turning to Thompson)

You won't forget, will you, about

the cigars?  And tell them to wrap

them up to look like toothpaste,

or something, or they'll stop them

at the desk.  That young doctor I

was telling you about, he's got an

idea he wants to keep me alive.

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE:

SUSAN

How do you want to handle the whole

thing - ask questions?

THOMPSON

I'd rather you just talked.

Anything that comes into your mind -

about yourself and Mr. Kane.

SUSAN

You wouldn't want to hear a lot of

what comes into my mind about myself

and Mr. Charlie Kane.

THOMPSON

How did you meet him?

SUSAN

I had a toothache.

SUSAN

That was thiry years ago - and I

still remember that toothache.

Boy!  That toothache was just

driving me crazy...

DISSOLVE OUT:

KANE

(hopping up and

down and rubbing

his knee)

Ow!

KANE

It's not funny.

SUSAN

I'm sorry, mister - but you do

look awful funny.

SUSAN

Ow!

KANE

What's the matter with you?

SUSAN

Toothache.

KANE

Hmm!

SUSAN

You've got some on your face.

KANE

If these sidewalks were kept in

condition - instead of the money

going to some cheap grafter -

KANE

What's funny now?

SUSAN

You are.  You look like you've

been making mud pies.

SUSAN

Oh!

KANE

You're no Venus de Milo.

SUSAN

(points to the

downstair window)

If you want to come in and wash

your face -  I can get you some

hot water to get that dirt off

your trousers -

KANE

Thanks.

DISSOLVE:

SUSAN

(by way of

explanation)

My landlady prefers me to keep

this door open when I have a

gentleman caller.

(starts to put the

basin down)

She's a very decent woman.

(making a face)

Ow!

SUSAN

Hey, you should be more careful.

That's my ma and pa.

KANE

I'm sorry.  They live here, too?

SUSAN

No.  They've passed on.

KANE

Where's the soap?

SUSAN

In the water.

KANE

(starting to wash

his hands)

You're very easily amused.

SUSAN

I always like to see the funny

side of things.  No sense crying

when you don't have to.  And you're

so funny.  Looking at you, I forget

all about my toothache.

SUSAN

Oh!

KANE

I can't stay here all night chasing

your pain away.

SUSAN

(laughs)

I know...  But you do look so silly.

KANE

Where's the towel?

SUSAN

On the chiffonier.  Here.

KANE

(rubs his face dry)

Thanks.

SUSAN

(on her way to closet)

I've got a brush in the closet.

As soon as the mud on your trousers

is all dry - you just brush it

off.

KANE

I'll get these streets fixed, if

it's the last thing I do.

KANE

(takes the brush)

You are in pain, aren't you, you

poor kid?

KANE

(brushing himself)

Wish there was something I could -

KANE

I've got an idea, young lady.

(there is no response)

Turn around and look at me.

(there is still no

response)

I said, turn around and look at

me, young lady.

KANE

Did you ever see anybody wiggle

both his ears at the same time?

KANE

Watch closely!

(he wiggles his

ears)

It took me two solid years at the

finest boys' school in the world

to learn that trick.  The fellow

who taught me is President of

Venezuela now.

KANE

That's it!  Smile!

DISSOLVE:

SUSAN

(hesitatingly)

A chicken?

KANE

No.  But you're close.

SUSAN

A rooster?

KANE

You're getting farther away all

the time.  It's a duck.

SUSAN

Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this

takes a lot of nerve, but - who

are you?  I mean - I'm pretty

ignorant, guess you caught on to

that -

KANE

(looks squarely at

her)

You really don't know who I am?

SUSAN

No.  That is, I bet it turns out

I've heard your name a million

times, only you know how it is -

KANE

But you like me, don't you?  Even

though you don't know who I am?

SUSAN

You've been wonderful!  I can't

tell you how glad I am you're here,

I don't know many people and -

(she stops)

KANE

And I know too many people.

Obviously, we're both lonely.

(he smiles)

Would you like to know where I was

going tonight - when you ran into

me and ruined my Sunday clothes?

SUSAN

I didn't run into you and I bet

they're not your Sunday clothes.

You've probably got a lot of

clothes.

KANE

(as if defending

himself from a

terrible onslaught)

I was only joking!

(pauses)

This evening I was on my way to

the Western Manhattan Warehouses -

in search of my youth.

KANE

You see, my mother died, too - a

long time ago.  Her things were

put into storage out west because

I had no place to put them then.

I still haven't.  But now I've

sent for them just the same.  And

tonight I'd planned to make a sort

of sentimental journey -

(slowly)

- to the scenes of my youth - my

childhood, I suppose - to look

again at -

(he changes mood

slightly)

and now -

KANE

Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles

Foster Kane was born in New Salem,

Colorado in eighteen six -

(he stops on the

word "sixty" -

obviously a little

embarrassed)

I run a couple of newspapers.  How

about you?

SUSAN

Oh, me -

KANE

How old did you say you were?

SUSAN

(very bright)

I didn't say.

KANE

I didn't think you did.  If you

had, I wouldn't have asked you

again, because I'd have remembered.

How old?

SUSAN

Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in

August.

KANE

(looks at her

silently for a

moment)

That's a ripe old age -  What do

you do?

SUSAN

I work at Seligman's.

KANE

Is that what you want to do?

SUSAN

I want to be a singer.

(she thinks for a

moment)

I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for

me.

KANE

(sympathetically)

What happened to the singing?

You're not in a show, are you?

SUSAN

Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother

always thought - she used to talk

about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine!

An American girl, for one thing -

and then my voice isn't really

that kind anyway, it's just that

Mother - you know what mothers are

like.

KANE

Yes -

SUSAN

As a matter of fact, I do sing a

little.

KANE

(points to the piano)

Would you sing for me?

SUSAN

(bashful)

Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me

sing.

KANE

Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.

SUSAN

Well, I -

KANE

Don't tell me your toothache is

bothering you again?

SUSAN

Oh, no, that's all gone.

KANE

Then you have no alibi at all.

Please sing.

DISSOLVE:

SUSAN

I did a lot of singing after that.

I sang for Charlie -  I sang for

teachers at a hundred bucks an

hour - the teachers got that, I

didn't -

THOMPSON

What did you get?

SUSAN

(glares at him

balefully)

What do you mean?

SUSAN

I didn't get a thing.  Just the

music lessons.  That's all there

was to it.

THOMPSON

He married you, didn't he?

SUSAN

He was in love with me.  But he

never told me so until after it

all came out in the papers about

us - and he lost the election and

that Norton woman divorced him.

THOMPSON

What about that apartment?

SUSAN

He wanted me to be comfortable -

Oh, why should I bother?  You don't

believe me, but it's true.  It

just happens to be true.  He was

really interested in my voice.

(sharply)

What are you smiling for?  What do

you think he built that opera house

for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't

want to sing.  It was his idea -

everything was his idea - except

my leaving him.

DISSOLVE:

MATISTI

Impossible!  Impossible!

KANE

Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane

your opinion of her talents.

You're supposed to train her voice.

Nothing more.

MATISTI

(sweating)

But, it is impossible.  I will be

the laughingstock of the musical

world!  People will say -

KANE

If you're interested in what people

say, Signor Matisti, I may be able

to enlighten you a bit.  The

newspapers, for instance.  I'm an

authority on what the papers will

say, Signor Matisti, because I own

eight of them between here and San

Francisco...  It's all right, dear.

Signor Matisti is going to listen

to reason.  Aren't you, maestro?

(he looks him square

in the eyes)

MATISTI

Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -

KANE

You can't.

KANE

I knew you'd see it my way.

DISSOLVE:

THE VOICE

- really pathetic.

DISSOLVE:

SUSAN

You don't propose to have yourself

made ridiculous?  What about me?

I'm the one that has to do the

singing.  I'm the one that gets

the razzberries.

(pauses)

Last week, when I was shopping,

one of the salesgirls did an

imitation of me for another girl.

She thought I didn't see her, but -

Charlie, you might as well make up

your mind to it.  This is one thing

you're not going to have your own

way about.  I can't sing and you

know it -  Why can't you just -

KANE

My reasons satisfy me, Susan.  You

seem unable to understand them.  I

will not tell them to you again.

(he is very close

to her)

You will continue with your singing.

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE:

KANE'S VOICE

Let's have your keys, Raymond.

RAYMOND'S VOICE

Yes, sir.

KANE'S VOICE

The key must be in the other side.

We'll knock the door down, Raymond.

RAYMOND'S VOICE

(calling)

Mrs. Kane -

KANE'S VOICE

Do what I say.

KANE

Get Dr. Corey.

RAYMOND

Yes, sir.

DISSOLVE:

DR. COREY

She'll be perfectly all right in a

day or two, Mr. Kane.

DR. COREY

The nurse has complete instructions,

but if you care to talk to me at

any time, I should be only too

glad -  I shall be here in the

morning.

KANE

Thank you.  I can't imagine how

Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly

mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner

gave her is in a somewhat larger

bottle -  I suppose the strain of

preparing for her trip has excited

and confused her.

DR. COREY

I'm sure that's it.

(he starts out)

KANE

There are no objections to my

staying here with her, are there?

DR. COREY

Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to

be here, too.

KANE

Of course.

DISSOLVE:

SUSAN

(in a voice that

comes from far

away)

I couldn't make you see how I felt,

Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I

couldn't go threw with singing

again.  You don't know what it

means to feel - to know that people -

that an audience don't want you.

That if you haven't got what they

want - a real voice -

they just don't care about you.

Even when they're polite - and

they don't laugh or get restless

or - you know...  They don't want

you.  They just -

KANE

(angrily)

That's when you've got to fight

them.  That's when you've got to

make them.  That's -

KANE

I'm sorry.

(he leans over to

pat her hand)

You won't have to fight them

anymore.

(he smiles a little)

It's their loss.

DISSOLVE:

SUSAN

(with a sigh)

What time is it?

SUSAN

Charlie!  I said, what time is it?

KANE

(looks up - consults

his watch)

Half past eleven.

SUSAN

I mean in New York.

KANE

Half past eleven.

SUSAN

At night?

KANE

Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to

press.

SUSAN

(sarcastically)

Hurray for the bulldog!

(sighs)

Half past eleven!  The shows have

just let out.  People are going to

night clubs and restaurants.  Of

course, we're different.  We live

in a palace - at the end of the

world.

KANE

You always said you wanted to live

in a palace.

SUSAN

Can't we go back, Charlie?

SUSAN

Charlie -

SUSAN

If I promise to be a good girl!

Not to drink - and to entertain

all the governors and the senators

with dignity -

(she puts a slur

into the word)

Charlie -

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE:

KANE

One thing I've never been able to

understand, Susan.  How do you

know you haven't done them before?

SUSAN

It makes a whole lot more sense

than collecting Venuses.

KANE

You may be right -  I sometimes

wonder - but you get into the

habit -

SUSAN

(snapping)

It's not a habit.  I do it because

I like it.

KANE

I was referring to myself.

(pauses)

I thought we might have a picnic

tomorrow - it might be a nice change

after the Wild West party tonight.

Invite everybody to go to the

Everglades -

SUSAN

(throws down a piece

of the jigsaw puzzle

and rises)

Invite everybody!  Order everybody,

you mean, and make them sleep in

tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents

when they have a nice room of their

own - with their own bath, where

they know where everything is?

KANE

I thought we might invite everybody

to go on a picnic tomorrow.  Stay

at Everglades overnight.

(he pats her lightly

on the shoulder)

Please see that the arrangements

are made, Susan.

KANE

You remember my son, Mr. Bernstein.

Oh, yes.  How do you do, Mr. Kane?

Oh, I know I always say I mean it,

so don't do what I say I'm going

to - but -

KANE

(interrupting)

You're in a tent, darling.  You're

not at home.  And I can hear you

very well if you just talk in a

normal tone of voice.

SUSAN

I'm not going to have my guests

insulted, just because you think -

(in a rage)

- if people want to bring a drink

or two along on a picnic, that's

their business.  You've got no

right -

KANE

(quickly)

I've got more than a right as far

as you're concerned, Susan.

SUSAN

Oh, I'm sick and tired of you

telling me what I must and what I

musn't do!

KANE

(gently)

You're my wife, Susan, and -

SUSAN

I'm not just your wife, I'm a person

all by myself - or I ought to be.

I was once.  Sometimes you get me

to believing I never was.

KANE

We can discuss all this some other

time, Susan.  Right now -

SUSAN

I'll discuss what's on my mind

when I want to.  You're not going

to keep on running my life the way

you want it.

KANE

As far as you're concerned, Susan,

I've never wanted anything -  I

don't want anything now - except

what you want.

SUSAN

What you want me to want, you mean.

What you've decided I ought to

have - what you'd want if you were

me.  But you've never given me

anything that -

KANE

Susan, I really think -

SUSAN

Oh, I don't mean the things you've

given me - that don't mean anything

to you.  What's the difference

between giving me a bracelet or

giving somebody else a hundred

thousand dollars for a statue you're

going to keep crated up and never

look at?  It's only money.  It

doesn't mean anything.  You're not

really giving anything that belongs

to you, that you care about.

KANE

(he has risen)

Susan, I want you to stop this.

And right now!

SUSAN

Well, I'm not going to stop it.

I'm going to say exactly what I

think.

(she screams)

You've never given me anything.

You've tried to buy me into giving

you something.  You're -

(a sudden notion)

- it's like you were bribing me!

That's what it's been from the

first moment I met you.  No matter

how much it cost you - your time,

your money - that's what you've

done with everybody you've ever

known.  Tried to bribe them!

KANE

Susan!

KANE

You're talking an incredible amount

of nonsense, Susan.

(quietly)

Whatever I do -  I do - because I

love you.

SUSAN

Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me

or anybody else!  You want to be

loved - that's all you want!  I'm

Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you

want - just name it and it's yours!

Only love me!  Don't expect me to

love you -

SUSAN

You - you hit me.

SUSAN

You'll never have another chance

to hit me again.

(pauses)

Never knew till this minute -

KANE

Susan, it seems to me -

SUSAN

Don't tell me you're sorry.

KANE

I'm not sorry.

SUSAN

I'm going to leave you.

KANE

No, you're not.

SUSAN

(nods)

Yes.

DISSOLVE:

RAYMOND

Mrs. Kane would like to see you,

Mr. Kane.

KANE

All right.

KANE

Is Mrs. Kane -

(he can't finish)

RAYMOND

Marie has been packing since

morning, Mr. Kane.

SUSAN

Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.  He

can get the bags.

MARIE

Yes, Mrs. Kane.

KANE

Have you gone completely crazy?

KANE

Don't you realize that everybody

here is going to know about this?

That you've packed your bags and

ordered the car and -

SUSAN

- And left?  Of course they'll

hear.  I'm not saying goodbye -

except to you - but I never imagined

that people wouldn't know.

KANE

I won't let you go.

SUSAN

You can't stop me.

SUSAN

Goodbye, Charlie.

KANE

(suddenly)

Don't go, Susan.

SUSAN

Let's not start all over again,

Charlie.  We've said everything

that can be said.

KANE

Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!

KANE

You mustn't go, Susan.

Everything'll be exactly the way

you want it.  Not the way I think

you want it - by your way.  Please,

Susan - Susan!

KANE

Don't go, Susan!  You mustn't go!

(almost blubbering)

You - you can't do this to me,

Susan -

SUSAN

I see - it's you that this is being

done to!  It's not me at all.  Not

how I feel.  Not what it means to

me.

(she laughs)

I can't do this to you!

(she looks at him)

Oh, yes I can.

DISSOLVE OUT:

SUSAN

In case you've never heard of how

I lost all my money - and it was

plenty, believe me -

THOMPSON

The last ten years have been tough

on a lot of people.

SUSAN

They haven't been tough on me.  I

just lost my money.  But when I

compare these last ten years with

the twenty I spent with him -

THOMPSON

I feel kind of sorry for him, all

the same -

SUSAN

(harshly)

Don't you think I do?

(pause)

You say you're going down to Xanadu?

THOMPSON

Monday, with some of the boys from

the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants

the whole place photographed

carefully - all that art stuff.

We run a picture magazine, you

know -

SUSAN

I know.  If you're smart, you'll

talk to Raymond.  That's the butler.

You can learn a lot from him.  He

knows where the bodies are buried.

SUSAN

Well, what do you know?  It's

morning already.

(looks at him)

You must come around and tell me

the story of your life sometime.

FADE OUT:

RAYMOND

Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to

handle the old man.  He was kind

of queer, but I knew how to handle

him.

THOMPSON

Queer?

RAYMOND

Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy

those last years - he didn't have

much reason to be -

DISSOLVE:

RAYMOND

(reading)

Mr. Charles Foster Kane announced

today that Mrs. Charles Foster

Kane has left Xanadu, his Florida

home, under the terms of a peaceful

and friendly agreement with the

intention of filing suit for divorce

at an early date.  Mrs. Kane said

that she does not intend to return

to the operatic career which she

gave up a few years after her

marriage, at Mr.  Kane's request.

Signed, Charles Foster Kane.

RAYMOND

Exclusive for immediate

transmission.  Urgent priority all

Kane papers.

FRED

Okay.

KATHERINE

Yes ... yes...  Mrs. Tinsdall -

Very well.

(turns to Raymond)

It's the housekeeper.

RAYMOND

Yes?

KATHERINE

She says there's some sort of

disturbance up in Mrs. Alexander's

room.  She's afraid to go in.

DISSOLVE:

KANE

(without turning)

Close the door, Raymond.

RAYMOND

Yes, sir.

(he closes it)

KANE

Lock it - and keep it locked.

KANE

Raymond -

(he is almost in a

trance)

RAYMOND

Yes, sir -

KANE

Keep it locked.

DISSOLVE:

ONE OF THE WORKMEN

Sorry, Mr. Kane, we won't be able

to cement it till tommorrow.  We -

RAYMOND

Okay.

KANE

Do you like poetry, Raymond?

RAYMOND

Can't say, sir.

KANE

Mrs. Kane liked poetry -

RAYMOND

Yes, Mr. Kane.

KANE

Not my wife - not either of them.

RAYMOND

(catching on)

Oh, yes, sir.

KANE

(looking back up at

the wall)

Do you know what that is?

RAYMOND

(more his keeper

than his butler

now)

It's a wall you bought in China,

Mr. Kane.

KANE

Persia.  It belonged to a king.

RAYMOND

How did you get him to part with

it, Mr. Kane?

KANE

He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do

you know what it means?

RAYMOND

No, I don't, Mr. Kane.

KANE

I didn't used to be afraid of it.

KANE

The drunkeness of youth has passed

like a fever, And yet I saw many

things, Seeing my glory in the

days of my glory, I thought my

power eternal And the days of my

life Fixed surely in the years But

a whisper came to me From Him who

dies not.  I called my tributary

kings together And those who were

proud rulers under me, I opened

the boxes of my treasure to them,

saying: "Take hills of gold,

moutains of silver, And give me

only one more day upon the earth."

But they stood silent, Looking

upon the ground; So that I died

And Death came to sit upon my

throne.  O sons of men You see a

stranger upon the road, You call

to him and he does not step.  He

is your life Walking towards time,

Hurrying to meet the kings of India

and China.

(quoting)

O sons of men You are caught in

the web of the world And the spider

Nothing waits behind it.  Where

are the men with towering hopes?

They have changed places with owls,

Owls who have lived in tombs And

now inhabit a palace.

DISSOLVE OUT:

RAYMOND

(callously)

That's the whole works, right up

to date.

THOMPSON

Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

RAYMOND

Yes and no.

THOMPSON

(getting to his

feet)

Well, thanks a lot.

RAYMOND

See what I mean?  He was a little

gone in the head - the last couple

of years, anyway - but I knew how

to handle him.

(rises)

That "Rosebud" - that don't mean

anything.  I heard him say it.

He just said "Rosebud" and then he

dropped that glass ball and it

broke on the floor.  He didn't say

anything about that, so I knew he

was dead - He said all kind of

things I couldn't make out.  But I

knew how to take care of him.

RAYMOND

You can go on asking questions if

you want to.

THOMPSON

(coldly)

We're leaving tonight.  As soon as

they're through photographing

the stuff -

RAYMOND

Allow yourself plenty of time.

The train stops at the Junction On

signal - but they don't like to

wait.  Not now.  I can remember

when they'd wait all day ... if

Mr. Kane said so.

ASSISTANT

NO. 9182

ASSISTANT

"Nativity" - attributed to

Donatello, acquired Florence 1921,

cost 45,000 lira.  Got that?

THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN

Yeah.

PHOTOGRAPHER

All right!  Next!  Better get that

statue over there.

ASSISTANT

Okay.

RAYMOND

What do you think all that is worth,

Mr. Thompson?

THOMPSON

Millions - if anybody wants it.

RAYMOND

The banks are out of luck, eh?

THOMPSON

Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear

all right.

ASSISTANT

"Venus," Fourth Century.  Acquired

1911.  Cost twenty-three thousand.

Got it?

THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN

Okay.

ASSISTANT

(patting the statue

on the fanny)

That's a lot of money to pay for a

dame without a head.

SECOND ASSISTANT

(reading a label)

No. 483.  One desk from the estate

of Mary Kane, Little Salem,

Colorado.  Value $6.00.

THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN

Okay.

SECOND ASSISTANT

We're all set to get everything.

The junk as well as the art.

THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN

What's that?

RAYMOND

It's a jigsaw puzzle.

THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN

We got a lot of those.  There's a

Burmese Temple and three Spanish

ceilings down the hall.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Yeah, all in crates.

THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN

There's a part of a Scotch castle

over there, but we haven't bothered

to unwrap it.

PHOTOGRAPHER

I wonder how they put all those

pieces together?

ASSISTANT

(reading a label)

Iron stove.  Estate of Mary Kane.

Value $2.00.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Put it over by that statue.  It'll

make a good setup.

GIRL

(calling out)

Who is she anyway?

SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN

Venus.  She always is.

THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN

He sure liked to collect things,

didn't he?

RAYMOND

He went right on buying - right up

to the end.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Anything and everything - he was a

regular crow.

THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN

wonder -  You put all this together -

the palaces and the paintings and

the toys and everything - what

would it spell?

THOMPSON

Charles Foster Kane.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?

THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN

(to the dancers)

Turn that thing off, will you?

It's driving me nuts!  What's

Rosebud?

PHOTOGRAPHER

Kane's last words, aren't they,

Jerry?

(to the Third

Newspaperman)

That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it,

Jerry?  Did you ever find out what

it means, Jerry?

THOMPSON

No, I didn't.

SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN

Say, what did you find out about

him, anyway, Jerry?

THOMPSON

Not much.

SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN

Well, what have you been doing?

THOMPSON

Playing with a jigsaw puzzle -   I

talked to a lot of people who knew

him.

GIRL

What do they say?

THOMPSON

Well - it's become a very clear

picture.  He was the most honest

man who ever lived, with a streak

of crookedness a yard wide.  He

was a liberal and a reactionary;

he was tolerant - "Live and Let

Live" - that was his motto.  But

he had no use for anybody who

disagreed with him on any point,

no matter how small it was.  He

was a loving husband and a good

father - and both his wives left

him and his son got himself killed

about as shabbily as you can do

it.  He had a gift for friendship

such as few men have - he broke

his oldest friend's heart like

you'd throw away a cigarette

you were through with.  Outside of

that -

THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN

Okay, okay.

GIRL

What about Rosebud?  Don't you

think that explains anything?

THOMPSON

No, I don't.  Not much anway.

Charles Foster Kane was a man who

got everything he wanted, and then

lost it.  Maybe Rosebud was

something he couldn't get or lost.

No, I don't think it explains

anything.  I don't think any word

explains a man's life.  No -  I

guess Rosebud is just a piece in a

jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece.

THOMPSON

We'd better get along.  We'll miss

the train.

DISSOLVE:

RAYMOND

Throw that junk in, too.

FADE OUT:

THE END
