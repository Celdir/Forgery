Insomnia

HAP (O.S.)

Jesus.  Just look at all that.

HAP (cont'd)

I thought we had a population problem.

Everyone should just move up here.

(taps window)

Just look at it, Will.

WILL

I don't need to look at it.

HAP

Nothing wrong with smelling the roses.

WILL

Tell that to her, partner.

PILOT (O.S.)

Detective?

PILOT (cont'd)

Better check your belts.  We'll be

landing in about fifteen minutes.

OLD MAN (O.S.)

Eleanor?

ELLIE

Hey, Mr. Angstrom!

MR. ANGSTROM

What're you doing here?

ELLIE

Police business.

MR. ANGSTROM

Police business?

MR. ANGSTROM (cont'd)

Didn't you used to baby-sit for us?

ELLIE

I don't babysit any more, Mr. Angstrom.

Just made detective three weeks ago.

MR. ANGSTROM

Boy, Charlie must be short-handed down at

the station.

WILL

"Halibut fishing capital of the world."

HAP

This ought to be interesting.

ELLIE

(over the engine)

Detective Dormer!

ELLIE (cont'd)

It's a huge honor to meet you!  Ellie

Burr.  I'm here to take you to the

station!

WILL

My partner...

ELLIE

Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to

Nightmute!

ELLIE

I just want to say how incredible it is

to have you working with us, Detective

Dormer.  I've followed all your cases.

Theodore Dineli, Frank and Casey

Prud'homme, the Port Angeles shootings...

ELLIE (cont'd)

...And especially the Leland Street

Murders.  That was my case study at the

Academy.

PILOT

Tell your dad the game's gonna start late

this week, Ellie.

ELLIE

Sure thing, Spence.

ELLIE (cont'd)

That's where Ronald Langley cut you in

the basement of his father's house on 325

Leland, isn't it?

WILL

You did your homework, Officer.

ELLIE

Actually...

ELLIE

I just made detective three weeks ago.

CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)

Will Dormer!

CHIEF NYBACK

I'll be damned!

WILL

(warmly)

How you doing, Charlie?

HAP

Hey, Charlie.

CHIEF NYBACK

Christ.  I haven't seen you boys since...

WILL

Just after Leland Street.

CHIEF NYBACK

What's that, then?

HAP

Eight years.

WILL

Seven years.

CHIEF NYBACK

Seven years?  Where does it all go?  That

was some amazing time, though, wasn't it?

CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)

You haven't changed a bit, Will.

WILL

You have, Chief.

CHIEF NYBACK

I knew that was coming.  I deserve it.

CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)

Pay attention to this man, Ellie.  He'll

teach you how to be a great cop.

ELLIE

Yes, sir.

CHIEF NYBACK

That's all, for now.

ELLIE

Oh.  Right.  Okay.

WILL

Nice kid.

CHIEF NYBACK

(sits with a SIGH)

Got a love affair with police work.

Drives me crazy with it.

WILL

Keeping you busy up here, Charlie?

HAP

"2nd prize Great Kodiak Salmon Catch."

CHIEF NYBACK

I told you seven years ago this was a

stepping stone to retirement.

CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)

Looks like it's a good time for you to

get up here, too.  With all the bad

business going on down at Special Branch.

CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)

Just five bad apples so far?

WILL

So far.

CHIEF NYBACK

What's the D.A. got them on?

WILL

Four unwarranted shootings, witness

intimidation, and cocaine theft.

CHIEF NYBACK

How about you?  How you faring?

HAP

They're all over us, Charlie.

WILL

They're all over everybody.

HAP

I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption

Task Force."  Can you believe that?

Trying to root out any mistakes or

"oversights" any other Detectives may

have made over the years.  They're

turning it into a witch hunt.  Something

on the news about it practically every

night.

CHIEF NYBACK

Got a bunch of messages here from some

guy named Warfield.

WILL

That's I.A.'s pit bull.

CHIEF NYBACK

Wants me to keep him posted on all your

movements up here.

CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)

I'm just glad Buck could spare you a

couple of weeks.  Take you out of the

frenzy.  I gotta tell you, though, I sure

don't miss big city police work.  Not

that I was ever a great detective.  But

up here there's no Bureaucracy.  No

Public Relations.  No blurred lines.

Just good guys and bad guys.  Simple.

CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)

Except for this.

CHIEF NYBACK

Couldn't get a thing from the body.  Not

a trace.  Town's never dealt with

anything like this before.

CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)

I've briefed everybody about your coming.

They know to follow your lead.

CHIEF NYBACK

This is Detective Dormer and his partner

Detective Eckhart.  On loan from Buck

Lundgard, Seattle Robbery and Homicide

Special Branch.  They'll be helping with

the Connell case.

FRED

Helping?

CHIEF NYBACK

(ignoring him)

Anything they need to see, you show them;

anywhere they want to go, you take them.

(nods to Fred)

This is Detective Fred Duggar.  He's been

leading the investigation up to now.

WILL

Detective...

FRED

Suppose you want to see the body.

FRED

We can walk from here.

WILL

Guess that's what they call Alaskan

hospitality.

ELLIE (O.S.)

Don't worry about him...

ELLIE (cont'd)

He's just mad 'cause you're taking over.

FRED

Ellie!  Go type something!

CORONER (O.S.)

Did a fundascopic examination and found

papilledema and petechiae of the retina.

CORONER (cont'd)

Clear cause of death was herniation of

the brain stem due to intracerebral

hemorrhage.

HAP

Beaten to death.

CORONER

Beaten to death.

WILL

What about these contusions?

CORONER

Superficial.

WILL

Any signs of rape?

CORONER

None.

CORONER (cont'd)

She was a nice girl.  Played flute with

my granddaughter.

WILL

Wait.

WILL (cont'd)

He washed her hair.

WILL (cont'd)

Combed it.

WILL (cont'd)

Cleaned under her fingernails.  Clipped

them.

WILL (cont'd)

Toes, too.

(to Fred)

You found nothing on the body?

FRED

No.

WILL

No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...

FRED

Like I said, no.  We know about those

things up here.

WILL

He knew exactly what we'd be looking for.

Made sure to cover up all his tracks.

HAP

Even the best make mistakes.

RACHEL (O.S.)

Lower forty-eight.

HAP

Lower forty-eight?

RACHEL

You're not from here.  I can tell by your

walk.

HAP

Oh?  And how's that?

RACHEL

Unsure.

WILL

Detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart.

There should be a reservation for us.

RACHEL

(to Hap)

Your friend's all business.

WILL

I'm always all business.

WILL (cont'd)

Is it really 9:30?

RACHEL

(nods)

Alaskan summers.  Hope you're an easy

sleeper.  It'll be like this all night.

RACHEL (cont'd)

Sign here.

HAP (O.S.)

Me.

WILL

Come on in.

HAP

See you have the same decor as my room.

HAP (cont'd)

Same view, too.

(looks out)

I've been watching that tugboat for the

last half hour.  So small, pulling all

that weight.

(beat)

We have to talk, Will.

WILL

What do you want to talk about?

HAP

You know what about.

WILL

We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.

HAP

When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...

(heads over to him)

We have to figure out a plan of action

now.

WILL

You know my plan of action.

HAP

To do nothing.

WILL

That's right.

HAP

Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up

in his office again for five hours

yesterday.  Five hours.  Asking all kinds

of questions...

WILL

He's asking everybody questions.

HAP

But he's zeroing in on me.  On us.

Everyone's talking about it.

WILL

He's just rattling your cage.

HAP

Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife,

three kids, and a pension plan in the

balance, it's rattling hard.

WILL

We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as

that.

HAP

(lowers voice)

Look.  We've tampered with evidence.

We've pushed witnesses.  We've planted

shit.  And they're sniffing around like

dogs.  Especially on the Dobbs case...

WILL

Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy

and left him hanging in the basement like

a piece of meat.  You remember that?

HAP

You know I remember that.

WILL

One word to I.A. and he walks.

HAP

Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...

WILL

No way.

HAP

Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's

what Flynn's doing...

WILL

Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are

nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we

needed to do to make sure that son-of-

bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And

every bastard like him.  We say one word

about it and every case we ever brought

in is going to blow wide open and they'll

all walk.  Every last one.  And I am not

going to let that happen.  No deals.  No

compromises.  No discussions.

HAP

Goddammit, Will.  You grab on to

something and you don't let it go.

HAP

I don't know if it's because you think

it's the right thing to do or because

your pride won't let you do anything

else.  I can't tell any more.

(steps back)

But I can tell you one thing.  I'm

getting too old for this cowboy cop

stuff.  Breaking the rules.  Cleaning up

messes.  We're a dying breed, Will.

You're a dying breed.  I.A., the D.A.,

all those reporters - they don't care

what you did at Leland Street seven years

ago.  They don't care that you've made

this your life.  They don't care about

getting the bad guy...

WILL

I care.

HAP (cont'd)

They're watching us, Will.  Like it or

not.  They're watching us.

WILL

You got to be kidding me.

ELLIE

Fred wants us to meet him at the

Connell's.

ELLIE

Brought you a bear claw.  Just in case

you were hungry.

ELLIE (cont'd)

Local delicacy.

WILL

Think I'll pass.

WILL (cont'd)

What kind of calls you get around here?

ELLIE

Oh.  You know.  Small-time stuff.

Nothing like what you must get.  Mostly

drinking-related problems.  Domestic

abuse.  Barroom fights.  Stuff like that.

ELLIE (cont'd)

In the summer months it's pretty quiet.

That's when there's work out on the

boats.  The rest of the year, though...

ELLIE (cont'd)

Hey, there, Joe!

ELLIE (cont'd)

That's Joe Willy.  Took his family

hostage in November.  That was the most

exciting thing that happened last year.

I wasn't there, though.

(grinds gear)

Chief barely lets me handle anything

above a misdemeanor.

WILL

Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.

ELLIE

But they're so boring.  All small stuff.

WILL

It's all about the small stuff.  Small

lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights.

People give themselves away in a traffic

violation just as much as they do in a

murder case.  It's human nature.

WILL (cont'd)

Aren't you going to write that down?

ELLIE

Let me just...

MRS. CONNELL (O.S.)

I haven't tidied up, since Fred told me

not to touch anything.

MRS. CONNELL

I don't believe in keeping a child's room

like a shrine.

WILL

Typical seventeen year-old.

(beat)

She went to a party Friday night?

ELLIE

Down at a local dive the kids like to

hang out in.

WILL

No diary.

FRED

She left the party early.  Friends said

she had a fight with her boyfriend and

stormed out.

WILL

What time was that?

FRED

Around twelve-thirty.

WILL

Who was the last one to see her alive?

FRED

Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've

questioned him, searched his place.

Didn't find anything.

WILL

These are designer.  Expensive.

(looks up)

Could Randy Stetz afford these?

ELLIE

He fixes boat engines.

WILL

Well her mother didn't buy them for her.

HAP

What are we thinking?

WILL

Kay Connell had an admirer.

WILL (cont'd)

I want to talk to the boyfriend.

WILL

You don't seem all that sad.

RANDY

I haven't had a chance!  You fuckers been

all over my back since Monday!

HAP

You know smoking stunts your growth.

RANDY

Yeah, okay, fat-ass.

HAP

(smiles at Will)

More Alaskan hospitality.

WILL

Did you love her?

RANDY

Huh?

WILL

Kay Connell.  Did you love her?

RANDY

Sure.  She was nice.

WILL

"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all

soft inside.  Ever occur to you she

didn't love you back?

RANDY

Huh?

WILL

You heard me that time.

RANDY

She loved me.  She wanted to see me every

night.

WILL

But she was seeing someone else on the

side.

RANDY

I don't know what you're fucking talking

about.

WILL

Friday night, at the party - what'd you

fight about?

RANDY

Stuff.

WILL

What kind of stuff?

RANDY

Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.

WILL

The other guy?

RANDY

I told you I don't remember.

WILL

After that she left the party to go to

him.

RANDY

How should I know?...

WILL

Ran like hell to go to him...

RANDY

Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your

fucking cop questions...

WILL

Now you listen to me, you little shit.

This fuck-the-world-Metallica-t-shirt

crap may work with your mamma, but it

doesn't work with me.  You got mad at

your girlfriend because she was seeing

someone else.  You want to be the last

person who saw her alive or are you going

to tell me who that is?

RANDY

I don't know.

WILL

You don't know.

RANDY

She didn't tell me.

ELLIE

He's a little surly, isn't he?

WILL

Just a little.

WILL

I want you to check this out, Ellie.

ELLIE

We already did.

WILL

Do it again.

ELLIE

But there wasn't any...

WILL

The small things - remember?  The second

you're about to dismiss something - look

at it again.

ELLIE

You want me to write that down?

WILL

Who's that?

ELLIE

The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there

Friday night.

WILL

Good.  He's up next.

WILL

(reading)

Halibut Calabrese.  Halibut Olympia.

Halibut Cajun Style.  Halibut fish and

chips...

WILL (cont'd)

Can't wait to see what's for dessert.

HAP

At least there's variety.

WILL

Looks like the natives are restless.

HAP

Will?

HAP (cont'd)

I think, I think I'm gonna talk to Buck

when we get back to Seattle.

HAP

I wish I could stick it out like you.  I

just, with Trish and the kids...

WILL

Don't do this, Hap...

HAP

I'm thinking I could get off with

probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's

all I want.

WILL

(hisses)

Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're

doing...

HAP

You don't have to be involved, Will.

WILL

You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I

like it or not...

RACHEL (O.S.)

Ready to order?

HAP

Hey - you do everything around here?

RACHEL

Just about.

WILL

I'll just have another Scotch in my room.

(turns to Rachel)

If you don't mind.

WILL

Where is it?

ELLIE

Over here.

WILL

We're sure it's hers?

FRED

Has her books in it.

HAP

What about prints?

WILL

Biology and Algebra.

WILL (cont'd)

Find out who she studied with.

WILL (cont'd)

Make-up.

WILL (cont'd)

Find out where she bought it.

WILL (cont'd)

Lab.

WILL (cont'd)

(reading titles)

Otherwise Engaged, Murder at Sunset.

WILL (cont'd)

Who here reads this kind of crap?

FARRELL

I read that kind of crap.

WILL

Read them.  Tell me anything that strikes

you.

WILL (cont'd)

Lab.

WILL (cont'd)

That's it.

FRED

I'll stick it in the evidence locker...

WILL

No.

WILL (cont'd)

We put it back where we found it.

WILL (cont'd)

You said it was a fishing cabin.

FARRELL

Uh, right.  About two miles outside of

town.

ELLIE

On the beach.

FRED

Why are we taking it back?

WILL

This murder was in the papers, right?

ELLIE

Yeah.  All over.

WILL

Call all of them from here to Anchorage.

Tell them we now know that Kay Connell

left the party with a dark blue knapsack,

but we haven't recovered it yet.

(checks watch)

We can get it in by the morning editions.

WILL (cont'd)

Fill this with random books.  Make it

look heavy.

WILL (cont'd)

It'll eat this guy alive if he thinks he

overlooked a detail.

HAP (O.S.)

Nice.  Lighter than I remembered.

FARRELL

Glock 40.  All plastic save the barrel

and firing pin.  Never rusts.  What do

you carry down in Seattle?

HAP

Smith and Wesson 45.

FARRELL

Excellent!

ELLIE (O.S.)

Brought some coffee...

FRED

What are you doing here?

WILL

(answering for her)

I told her to come.

ELLIE

Anything yet?

WILL                    FRED

Nothing.                Nothing.

FARRELL

Maybe this guy doesn't read the papers.

HAP

Or goes straight to the Sports Section.

HAP (cont'd)

Who gets first dibs?

(looks up at Will)

Will?

FRED

(looking through binoculars)

I see someone!

WILL (O.S.)

That's him.

WILL (cont'd)

Fan out.

WILL (cont'd)

Stay here, Ellie.

ELLIE

But...

FRED

He's bolting!

WILL

Go!  Go!  Go!

WILL

Police!

WILL (cont'd)

Goddammit!

WILL (cont'd)

You!  Head back up to base...

(to Fred)

You!  Go right and follow along the

water...

(to Hap)

Hap!  You go left...

WILL (cont'd)

Go!

FARRELL

Sorry about...

WILL

Where is he?

WILL (cont'd)

(impatient)

Where'd the shot come from?

FARRELL

Over there.

WILL

Freeze!

VOICE (O.S.)

Dammit, Ellie!...

FRED (cont'd)

Put that thing away!  Farrell's down!...

VOICE (O.S.)

Hap!

WILL

Hap!

WILL (cont'd)

Hap!

FRED

Dormer...

FRED (cont'd)

Dormer!  He's gone.

CHIEF NYBACK

And then you lost him.

WILL

And then I lost him.  In the fog.

CHIEF NYBACK

About how long 'til you heard the

suspect's second shot?

WILL

Twenty, thirty seconds.  I followed the

sound down to the water.  That's where...

WILL (cont'd)

That's where I found Hap.

CHIEF NYBACK

I think you need a glass of this.

WILL

(yells)

Why didn't I know about that goddamn

tunnel, Charlie?

CHIEF NYBACK

There's a bunch of those tunnels out

there, Will.  From bunkers over sixty

years old.  I don't even know half of

them myself, and I grew up here.

WILL

I had him, Charlie.  Right in front of

me.  Not two feet.  I could smell the son-

of-a-bitch.  Playing with me.  And I

missed the shot.  He was right there and

I missed the shot!  Then my goddamned gun

jammed...

CHIEF NYBACK

Will, you can't blame yourself.

WILL

I had him!

CHIEF NYBACK

It's only gonna make you crazy.

ELLIE

You wanted to see me?

CHIEF NYBACK

Right, Ellie.

CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)

I want you to take care of the

investigation into Detective Eckhart's

shooting.

ELLIE

But what about the Connell case?  I'm on

the Connell case.

CHIEF NYBACK

We need paperwork, Ellie.  You know that.

Just write up a quick report.

WILL

I'm going to check on the roadblocks...

CHIEF NYBACK

You're no good right now, Will.  Go back

to the Lodge.  Try to get some rest.

RADIO

...earlier this evening after an aborted

attempt to apprehend a suspect.  He was

forty-five...

RACHEL

I'm sorry about your partner.

RACHEL (cont'd)

It's been on the radio for the last two

hours.  Nothing but that.  Like when they

found Kay Connell's body.

(sympathetic smile)

We're not used to this sort of thing up

here.

RACHEL (cont'd)

He was standing right there just a couple

of days ago.  Your partner.  Exactly

where you are now.

(beat)

I hope I was nice to him.

WILL

You were nice to him.  He liked you.

RACHEL

(answering)

Pioneer Lodge?...

(listens)

Hold on a second.  He's right here.

RACHEL (cont'd)

John Warfield.  He's called a couple of

times.

RACHEL (cont'd)

Want me to lie?

WILL

(into phone)

Dormer.

WARFIELD'S VOICE

Detective Dormer.  I've been trying to

reach you.  I was very sorry to hear

about your partner, Detective Eckhart.

It must have been a terrible shock, what

happened this morning.

WILL

(into phone)

That's not exactly how I'd put it.

WARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd)

No, no.  I suppose not.  But I look

forward to reading the report.  Very

sad.  Very sad.  Funny...

WILL

(into phone)

What do you mean, "Funny?"

WARFIELD'S VOICE

Oh, nothing.  Just that I felt Detective

Eckhart and I, Hap and I, were starting

to make a real connection before you

left.  I sensed that he was ready to get

some things off his chest.  Did you

sense anything like that, Detective?  I

mean, as his partner?...

WARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd)

...You were his partner for, what, about

ten years?...

WILL

(into phone)

You know why everyone hates you,

Warfield?  It's not your questions, it's

not your press conferences, it's not even

your cheap suits; everyone hates you

'cause day after day you suck the marrow

out of real cops when you never had the

balls to become one yourself.  Well I got

to tell you, it's a shame you're not up

here with me because I'd love to show you

right now just what a real cop is capable

of.  You just remember that when you're

sitting at your bullshit desk reading

your bullshit report on my dead partner!

WILL (cont'd)

Next time.  Go ahead and lie.

WILL

Goddammit!

WILL (cont'd)

Goddamned...thing!

HAP

They're watching us, Will...

WILL

Hap!

CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)

...We're going to bring down a couple of

guys from Ridgemount, but I want us to

step up the investigation here...

CHIEF NYBACK

...Nightmute hasn't lost an officer in

thirty-seven years, and even though

Detective Eckhart wasn't from here, he

was as good as one of us on this case.  I

had the honor of working with him down in

Seattle for a number of years.  He was a

fine detective and an even better man.

CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)

Fred, you'll be working with Detective

Dormer directly from now on.

CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)

Will?  Anything you'd like to add?

CHIEF NYBACK

Okay.  Then let's get to it.

ELLIE (O.S.)

Detective Dormer?

ELLIE (cont'd)

I'm sorry to bother you, but I was asked

to write the report on...

(lowers eyes)

...you know what I was asked to write the

report on...

(looks back up)

...Could you, just to be accurate, for

the report, could you just point out

where you were when you saw Detective

Eckhart yesterday?

WILL

It's good to be accurate, Ellie.  You're

doing your job.

ELLIE

I'm so sorry about what happened.  I know

you did everything you could...

WILL

I was here.

FRED

Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that

went through Farrell.

WILL

I'm going to the hospital to talk to him

now.

(looks at his watch)

You get the search party together.  No

fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you

in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't

waste any time.

FRED

Partner or no partner.  That guy's a

prick.

ELLIE

He has to be a prick, Fred.  He's a great

detective.

FARRELL

Detective Dormer!

Will stands by his bed.  Farrell puts down the book.  Picks

up the Snickers.

FARRELL (cont'd)

You don't seem like the bring-an-

underling-who's-in-the-hospital-a-

Snickers-bar kind of guy.

WILL

I'm not.

WILL (cont'd)

How's the book?

FARRELL

Oh, a real tear-jerker.  Brody, the good

guy, just got shot.

FARRELL (cont'd)

Oh.  I'm sorry.  About Hap.  Detective

Eckhart.

WILL

Thanks.

FARRELL

I wish I'd had the chance to get to know

him better.  Take him fishing or

something.

WILL

He would have liked that.

FARRELL

We just gotta catch the bastard, right?

WILL

That's why I'm here.  I need to know

exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.

FARRELL

What I saw?

WILL

Anything.  It's important.

FARRELL

Pretty much nothing.  That fog was so

thick.  The bullet seemed to come out of

nowhere.  I don't even remember seeing

any shapes.  Then I saw you.  But only

when you came up close.  Then you

disappeared again.

(shrugs)

I guess I heard more than I saw.

FARRELL (cont'd)

Sorry.

WILL

No.  No.  Don't be sorry.  It's not your

fault.

NURSE

Time for your meds.

FARRELL

Lonnie and I went to high school

together.

LONNIE

Just take the pills, Farrell.

WILL

How's the leg?

FARRELL

Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much.

Bullet went right through.

WILL

Right.  Got lost in the rocks.

FARRELL

We'll get the other one, though.

FARRELL (cont'd)

After the autopsy.

ELLIE (O.S.)

...and it was at this point that Detective

Dormer headed towards the noise...

ELLIE (cont'd)

Remember, Kepp, shoot everything...

(back to the tape recorder)

...wherein he discovered the wounded

Detective Farrell Brooks, having been

shot in the vastus externus of the upper

left thigh...

ELLIE (cont'd)

Francis!

FRANCIS

What?

ELLIE

You're supposed to be Farrell.  Shot in

the thigh and writhing in pain.

FRANCIS

C'mon, Ellie.  What's it matter?

ELLIE

Accuracy.  That's what.

(points to the ground)

Now get down.

FRANCIS

Ow.

ELLIE

(into tape recorder)

...shortly after hearing the second shot,

Detective Dormer continued through the

water until he spotted the body, lying

approximately fifteen feet away.

Looks back up.  Fog.  Clicks off the recorder.  Calls out.

ELLIE (cont'd)

You there, Rich?

VOICE (O.S.)

Yeah.  And I'm freezing my nads off!

FRANCIS

Ellie!  Think I found something!

WILL (O.S.)

...Anything catches your eye, you put it

in a bag.  Anything looks strange, you

put it in a bag...

WILL (cont'd)

...Anything he may have dropped, moved,

kicked, or stepped on, you put in a bag.

Cigarette butts, gum wrappers, paper

clips, coins, buttons - nine times out of

ten a suspect leaves something behind...

VOICE (O.S.)

Detective?

BURLY GUY #1

Where do you want us?

WILL

The woods.  One group heading south, the

other heading north.

FRED

Make sure they're set to channel 6...

OFFICER #1

We did the interviews with all the nearby

houses like you asked.

WILL

Anything?

OFFICER #1

(shakes his head)

Here's a list of who we talked to.

WILL

Alright.  Go back and set up some follow-

ups for this afternoon.

FRED

You don't think they should start further

back?

WILL

He had to have exited here.  Over those

boulders.  I saw him move, he's nimble.

Would have taken the hardest way out.

FRED

(into phone)

Duggar...

FRED (cont'd)

(into phone)

Where was it?

FRED (cont'd)

(into phone)

Okay.

(slaps phone closed)

That was Ellie.

FRED (cont'd)

They found Farrell's bullet.  Says it

looks like a 357.  After the autopsy Rich

can drive 'em both to the lab in

Anchorage.  Have a murder weapon by

morning.

FRED (cont'd)

That is, if it's alright with you.

RACHEL

Here.  It's on the house.

WILL

Thanks.

RACHEL

I got it.

(smiles)

Don't know why I bother.  It's been

broken for two years.

WILL

Habit.

RACHEL (cont'd)

Oh.  A man came by to see you earlier.

Said he was your new partner.

WILL

Fred Duggar?

RACHEL

No.  He didn't say what his name was.

Only that you were expecting him.

WILL

I'm not expecting anyone.

RACHEL

That's not what he thinks.

WILL

What did he look like?

RACHEL

Short.  Dark hair.  Not that memorable.

WILL

I need to borrow something.

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

ELLIE (cont'd)

Detective Dormer!  What are you doing

here?

(looks at watch)

It's two-thirty in the morning.

Shouldn't you be asleep?

WILL

I could say the same thing about you.

ELLIE

Oh.  We always have play-offs in the

middle of the night.  It's the best time.

WILL

Who's playing?

ELLIE

The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in

extra innings.  The Hawks have a really

good line-up this year.

ELLIE

That's my sister.

ELLIE (cont'd)

(calling out)

That's okay, Lib!

(to Will)

Usually she's better.

WILL

She your only sibling?

ELLIE

(nods)

Twelve years younger.

ELLIE (cont'd)

What about you?  You have any siblings?

WILL

No.

(rubs his eyes)

Well.  I had a brother.  He died when I

was eleven.

ELLIE

Oh, I shouldn't have...

WILL

It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He

was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.

ELLIE

That must have been awful for you.

WILL

Not really.

(slight smile)

I remember I was more embarrassed that he

had died.  Embarrassed that it made me

different.  So I didn't tell the other kids

at school what had happened.  They'd ask

me where he was, where he'd gone.  And I'd

make up stories.  He was visiting an aunt up

north, he'd broken his leg, he was in a

Swiss boarding school.  Stuff like that.

(shakes his head)

Nice kid, huh?  Just kept making up more

and more lies...

ELLIE

You okay?

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

WILL

I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie.

Still need to go through some of Kay

Connell's school records.

ELLIE

(unsure)

Okay.

ELLIE (cont'd)

Try to get some sleep!

WILL

(calls out window)

Officer!...

WILL

I'll pick it up.  You head back to the

station.

WILL

(into phone)

Duggar - I'm at the coroner's now.  I'll

be back in about twenty minutes...

CORONER

Detective.  Thought you were sending one

of your lackeys.

WILL

I thought it was better if I came.  Under

the circumstances.

CORONER

It's different when you know them, isn't

it?

(nods to clipboard)

Just sign over there and she's all yours.

CORONER (O.S.)

Your partner didn't suffer much...

CORONER (cont'd)

Maybe for a minute or two.

CORONER (cont'd)

Just enough time to reflect.

WILL

Thanks, Doc.

CORONER

You're looking a little green, Detective.

WILL (O.S.)

So where's the other bullets?

WILL

What's with all the moose antlers around

here?

FRED

Lots of moose.

WILL

When's Rich coming?

FRED

I'll call him now.

WILL

First I need a copy of the key.

FRED

This isn't Seattle, Detective.  We don't

have copies.

(holds up key)

This is the only one.

SECRETARY

Detective Dormer?  Telephone.

SECRETARY

This came for you earlier.

WILL

(into phone)

Dormer.

WILL (cont'd)

Goddammit, Warfield, if you're gonna

check up on me every...

MAN'S VOICE

I bet you haven't been getting much

sleep.

WILL

(into phone)

What?

MAN'S VOICE

You lower-48s.  You think the white

nights are kind of neat.  Then you can't

sleep for days.  I've seen it happen

about a million times.  But you can't

sleep for a different reason.

WILL

(into phone)

Who is this?

WILL

(into phone)

I said, who is this?

MAN'S VOICE

I saw what really happened, Will...

MAN'S VOICE

I saw you kill your partner.  With your

back-up weapon.  Out there on the beach.

I saw you shoot him dead...

WILL

(sotto, into phone)

Now you listen to me...

MAN'S VOICE

Don't worry.  I won't tell anyone.  Oh,

and I saw you take my gun.  My uncle's

old 357.  I dropped it in the rocks.

But you can go ahead and keep that.

MAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

...I mean...

(beat)

...Now that we're partners.

ELLIE (O.S.)

Detective Dormer!

ELLIE

You look like you're in a hurry.  I just

wanted to ask you about these pictures.

ELLIE (cont'd)

I know they're not great quality, but

this is where you said you were when you

first saw Detective Eckhart, right?

WILL

Right.

ELLIE

But here's the thing.  I retraced your

exact steps according to your statement.

You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart

from there.  I mean, not in that fog.

WILL

Then change it.

ELLIE

How much closer would you say you were?

WILL

I don't remember.

ELLIE

Five feet?  Seven feet?

WILL

Listen, Ellie.  I don't have time for

this shit.  Five feet, seven feet, twenty

feet.  Put down whatever you want in your

report, alright?

FRED (O.S.)

Dormer...

WILL

These should have gone out two hours ago.

YOUNG GIRL

...And that's how I think Kay would want

us to remember her...

YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)

...Swimming, reading, hiking through the

Kebaughs...

YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)

...playing her flute, meeting at Darrow's

after school...

YOUNG GIRL

...And always, always with a smile on her

face.

VOICE (O.S.)

Want one?

FRED

We should go say hello to Mrs. Connell.

WILL

You go ahead.  I'll be there in a second.

WILL (O.S.)

Why don't I give her a ride?

RANDY

Thought I smelled something.

WILL

Good to see you, too, Randy.

TANYA

Who're you?

RANDY

Fuckin' cop.

RANDY

You coming or not?

TANYA

I never met anyone from Seattle before.

WILL

You're not missing much.

TANYA

What are you doing in this shit-hole

town?

WILL

You were good friends with Kay Connell,

weren't you?

TANYA

I was her best friend.

WILL

Best friend?

TANYA

Since grade school.

WILL

That's a long time.

TANYA

We were like sisters.  Knew everything

about each other.

WILL

Must be tough for you.  What happened.

TANYA

Everybody says I'm holding up great,

considering.  Don't even care if I go to

school.  They're all worried I haven't

cried yet.

TANYA (cont'd)

But there's no law against not crying,

right?

WILL

What about Kay's other friends?

TANYA

Do we have to talk about Kay?  I don't

want to talk about her right now.  Let's

just drive.  Go somewhere.

WILL

You want me to take you somewhere?

TANYA

Long as it's fun.

TANYA (cont'd)

Young, impressionable girl left alone

with older, Seattle detective.  Who knows

what we could get up to.

WILL

How about this.  You like this?

TANYA

Hey...

WILL

Thought you wanted something fun...

TANYA

Move over!

TANYA (cont'd)

(screaming)

Move over, you crazy fuck!

TANYA

You crazy son-of-a-bitch!  You could have

killed us!

TANYA (cont'd)

Ow!  You're hurting me!

TANYA (cont'd)

You want to tell me what the fuck this is

all about?

WILL

You and Kay were like sisters?

TANYA

That's what I said.

WILL

Told each other everything.

(heads down the hill)

That why your picture's torn up in the

top drawer of her bureau?

WILL (cont'd)

Why her boyfriend's hand was clamped on

your ass at her funeral?

WILL (cont'd)

You like games, little girl?  Well how

about this one - you're standing right

where her naked body was found wrapped up

in a garbage bag.

TANYA

No...

WILL

Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?

WILL (cont'd)

Who gave her those dresses?

WILL (cont'd)

I need a name.

TANYA

I don't know.

WILL

You don't know.

TANYA

She wouldn't tell me!

WILL

But you were such good friends...

TANYA

It was like some big fucking secret!

WILL

What was?

TANYA

She kept saying she was gonna get out of

here.  Leave us all behind.  That he was

going to take her!

WILL

Who?

TANYA

My arm!

WILL

Who?

TANYA

She used some stupid code name.

WILL

What was it?

TANYA

Brody...I don't know...

(crying)

...Something Brody!

TANYA (cont'd)

You happy now, you fucking bastard?

WILL

Lucy.  Desi.

WALTER'S VOICE

Now you're mad at me.

WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd)

...I spotted your car around the corner.

You must have been in a hurry.  Put some

pieces together.  Don't worry, I would

have done the same thing...

WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd)

Anyway...

(blows nose)

...I'm not coming home.  So you

shouldn't wait there all day.  I mean,

they'll wonder about you at the station.

You should be careful about following

procedure, Will, especially now that...

WILL

Goddammit!

FRED

Forget your pager?

WILL

What?

FRED

I beeped you over two hours ago.

FRED (cont'd)

Got a fax from the lab.  Murder weapon

was a 357 Ruger.

WILL

Good.

FRED

And something else that might interest

you.

FRED (cont'd)

Remember this?

WILL

No.

FRED

One of the paperbacks we found in Kay

Connell's knapsack.

WILL

That's right.

FRED

Mrs. Connell found this copy in the

house.

(opens it up)

It's signed.  Personally.

WILL

So?

FRED

This is a local writer.  Kay had all his

books.  I think we should check it out.

WILL

I don't think it'll lead anywhere.

WILL (cont'd)

Well.  If he's local.  Give him a call.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Are you alright?  You popped out from

nowhere!

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

He okay?

OLD LADY

I don't think you should move.

OLD LADY

You sure you're okay?

WILL

I'm fine.

OLD LADY

Careful not to bleed on my interior.

WILL

Walter Byrd.

WALTER

When I was seven my mother and

grandmother took me to Vancouver.  We

were walking along the street one day

when these two men ran past and snatched

my grandmother's purse right from under

her arm.  Right from under her arm.  That

night a police officer came to our hotel

room to ask us questions.  Stood the

whole time.

WALTER (cont'd)

His uniform looked brand new.  His shoes

and badge were polished, his billy club,

his belt buckle.  All perfect.  He was

like a soldier, but better.

WALTER (cont'd)

Made a huge impression on me.  His

goodness.  Gave me an instant respect for

the police.  I tried to become a cop when

I left high school, but...

WALTER (cont'd)

Congenital problem.

WALTER (cont'd)

Oh.  We're here.

WALTER

You know this glacier moves a quarter of

an inch every day?

WALTER (cont'd)

And on a clear day you can see all the

way over to Newtok.  There's a beautiful

aviary over there.  We can go sometime.

WALTER (cont'd)

It's actually cool for this time of year.

Normally the temperature runs about...

WILL

You think this is a nice meeting we're

having here?  Friendly?  Two people

getting acquainted?

(jerks him harder)

You sick, coward, fuck.  I get up every

morning of my life just to bring someone

like you down.  Beating a seventeen year-

old girl to death.  Washing her

afterwards, cleaning her.  Make you feel

like a real man?

(tightens his grip)

Huh?

WILL (cont'd)

I outta end this right now.  Take a rock

and smash your fucking skull in...

WALTER

I stood right behind you...I saw you look

right into his eyes and shoot him...

WALTER (cont'd)

...Seattle's great hero.  Shooting his

own partner.  I saw it all...

WILL

That was an accident!  You hear me?  I

didn't know it was him!

(shakes him hard)

I didn't know it was him!

WALTER

Then why lie about it?

WALTER (cont'd)

I mean, I'm all for bending the truth.

That's what I do in my novels.  It's my

trade you might say.  But why cover it

up?

WALTER (cont'd)

You don't have to tell me if you don't

want to.  I'm sure you have some reason.

Something noble.  I have faith in that.

WALTER (cont'd)

They should be bundled up better.

WILL

What's your game, Byrd?

WALTER

No game.

WILL

The phone call.  The knapsack.

WALTER

I figured we're partners on this one.  I

mean, after what I saw...

WILL

Let's get one thing straight, Byrd.  We are

partners on nothing.

WALTER

I research my novels.  I know the

procedures.  You'd have cuffed me back at

the ferry.  You'd have called for back-

up, read me my rights, and gotten a

search warrant for my apartment.  You're

a well-respected detective.  There's

no reason for you to be talking to me

right now...

WALTER (cont'd)

...except that we could help each other.

WALTER (cont'd)

So.  We're at an impasse.

WILL

(sotto)

You're going to get a phone call.

WALTER

I'm sorry?

WILL

I said you're going to get a phone call.

WALTER

(perks up)

Oh?

WILL

Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of

your books.

WALTER

Thought you might find that.

WILL

You're going to be brought in for

questioning.

WALTER

Down at the station?

WILL

(hisses)

Yes down at the station.

WALTER

Okay.  Okay.  Brought in for questioning.

Good.  I can write this.

WALTER (cont'd)

Ferry's leaving.

WALTER (cont'd)

Something to divert...

WALTER (cont'd)

My gun.  You still have my gun, right?

WALTER (cont'd)

Then that's the wild card.  Every

detective story has a wild card.

WILL

What do you mean, "wild card?"

WALTER

Next ferry's in forty-five minutes.

WILL

What do you mean "wild card?"

WALTER

You'll know.  At the questioning.

TICKET TAKER

(to Will)

Full up.

WILL

I have a cold.

ELLIE

Which way are you walking?

WILL

Back to the Lodge.

ELLIE

I needed to get your signature on

something.

ELLIE (cont'd)

The report on Detective Eckhart.  Chief

made me finish it this morning.  Said it

was taking too long.

ELLIE (cont'd)

Aren't you going to read it?

WILL

I trust you.

ELLIE (cont'd)

Now I can help you with the Connell case.

That writer's coming in tomorrow.  Walter

Byrd.

WILL

Duggar called him?

ELLIE

About an hour ago.  Said he was more than

happy to cooperate.

ELLIE (cont'd)

You haven't been sleeping much, have you,

Detective Dormer?

WILL

Not really.

ELLIE

Isn't that the difference between a good

cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't

sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's

missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause

his conscience won't let him.

(smiles)

You said that once, remember?

WILL

No.  But it sounds like something I

would've said.

WILL (cont'd)

See you tomorrow, Ellie.

ELLIE

Oh!  I forgot to tell you.  The Puffins

won.

ELLIE (cont'd)

The baseball game.  Our team...

ELLIE (cont'd)

...We won.

WILL

(grabbing it)

Listen to me, you son-of-a-bitch...

RECORDED VOICE

...I saw you look right into his eyes

and shoot him...

RECORDED VOICE (cont'd)

...Seattle's great hero.  Shooting his

own partner.  I saw it all...

RECORDED VOICE (cont'd)

That was an accident!...

WILL

Goddammit, Byrd!

WALTER

You'd have done the same thing, Will.  I

know you would...

WILL

I didn't know!

HAP

You sure about that, buddy?

WILL

Fuck!

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

RACHEL (O.S.)

Detective Dormer?

RACHEL

(startled by his appearance)

Will...I...

WILL

What is it?

RACHEL

There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining

about the noise.

(beat)

Says he can't sleep.

RACHEL

Are you alright?

WILL

I'm fine.

RACHEL

Did something happen?

WILL

No.

RACHEL

Will...

WILL

The light.  It keeps coming in...

RACHEL

Will.

RACHEL (cont'd)

What happened?

WILL

There was this guy named Weston Dobbs.

Twenty-four.  Worked as a part-time stock

boy in a copy store.  Every morning he'd

sit at the only window in his apartment

and watch an eight year-old boy get

picked up by his carpool across the

street.  And every afternoon he'd watch

the boy get dropped off again.  He did

this for about six months.  Until one day

he got up the nerve to cross the street

and grab the boy before his carpool came.

Kept him in his apartment for three days.

Tortured him.  Raped him.  Made him do

things...

WILL (cont'd)

When he was done, he got a rope and a

kitchen stool and hanged the boy in the

basement of the apartment building.  But

he didn't do a good enough job.  The

little boy's neck didn't break and he

died from shock.  The landlord found him

five days later.

RACHEL

One of your cases?

WILL

Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I

knew the second I met Dobbs that he was

guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had

circumstantial evidence, but nothing to

tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went

over every inch of that apartment.

RACHEL

What happened?

WILL

We took some blood samples from the boy's

body and planted them in his apartment.

(beat)

Arrested him the next day.

RACHEL

Will.

WILL

There've been other cases.  Where we've

changed results.  Pushed witnesses.

Manipulated evidence.

(rubs his face)

But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than

anything.

RACHEL

What if someone finds out?

WILL

We're under investigation now.  Back in

Seattle.

(beat)

Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got

back.  Thought he could work out some

kind of deal.

RACHEL

Well, that's not going to happen now.

WILL

Do you think it was wrong?  What we did?

RACHEL

There are two kinds of people in Alaska.

Those who were born here and those who've

come here to escape something in their

lives.

(beat)

I wasn't born here, Will.  I'm in no

position to judge anyone.  I'm not about

that any more.

RACHEL (cont'd)

It's all about what you're willing to

live with.

FRED (O.S.)

You were acquainted with the deceased,

Kay Connell?

WALTER (O.S.)

Yes I was.

FRED

In what manner?

WALTER

She was, not quite a "fan."  More an avid

reader of my detective novels.

ELLIE

When did you first meet her?

WALTER

A year ago.  At one of my signings.

FRED

Where you signed this?

WALTER

That's right.

FRED

What happened at that signing?

WALTER

She flattered me about my writing.  Asked

if she could visit me.  To talk about my

books.

FRED

Did she?

WALTER

Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then

she became more comfortable.  Started

visiting me every week...

WILL

What was the nature of your relationship?

WALTER

What do you mean, Detective Dormer?

WILL

She was an attractive girl.  Did you have

sex with her?

WALTER

She was only seventeen.

WILL

But she was an attractive girl.

WALTER

I suppose.

WILL

Did you have sex with her?

WALTER

No.

WILL

But you wanted to.

WALTER

I was a mentor to her.

WILL

You gave her gifts.

WALTER

Yes.

WILL

Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.

WALTER

Yes.

WILL

Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.

WALTER

I gave her things she didn't have.

Couldn't have.

WALTER (cont'd)

Her family lives on Mr. Connell's

disability.  It isn't much.

FRED

We understand, Mr. Byrd.

(to Will)

You want to sit down, Detective?

WALTER

She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk

to.

FRED

How do you mean?

WALTER

That boyfriend.  Randy.

FRED

Randy Stetz?

WALTER

That's right.

WILL

What about him?

WALTER

He.  Well, he...

WALTER (cont'd)

I don't want to talk out of school.  Kay

told me things in the strictest of

confidence.  As a friend.

FRED

Mr. Byrd.  Anything you can tell us could

help out with this case.

WALTER

Well.  He hit her.

FRED

Are you sure about that?

WALTER

She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle

of the night.  Bruises all over her back,

her upper arms.  I pled with her to let

me call the police, but she wouldn't hear

it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.

ELLIE

Randy Stetz beat Kay Connell?

FRED

(angry)

Ellie.

WALTER

He has a terrible rage.  Kay even said he

carried a handgun around with him.

FRED

Margaret!  Get Judge Biggs on the phone!

(to Will)

I'll get another warrant for Stetz's

place.

WALTER

Could I have some more coffee, Detective

Burr?

RANDY (O.S.)

You can't fucking do this!

RANDY (O.S.)

Hey!  I'm working on that!

OFFICER (O.S.)

Found something.

RANDY (O.S.)

What the fuck is that!

FRED (O.S.)

That's it.  Let's bag it.

RANDY (O.S.)

That's not mine, man!  That's not mine!

FRED (O.S.)

Randy...

RANDY (O.S.)

No way, man!

RANDY (cont'd)

That ain't mine!

FRED

C'mon, Randy.

RANDY

I swear to God.  I didn't kill her.  I

swear to God...

FRED

You look like shit, cowboy.

WILL

That's an understatement.

FRED

Looks like we can wrap this one up.

FRED (cont'd)

We're getting together for a couple of

beers later on.  Might not be the Seattle

thing to do.  But you're welcome to come.

FARRELL (O.S.)

I can't believe it.  Randy Stetz.

RICH

What do you mean, you can't believe it?

FRANCIS

He was an asshole.

FARRELL

That doesn't mean anything.

FRED

Didn't you grow up with him?

FARRELL

Our dads were on the same boat.

(to Will)

We used to wait for them together.

FRANCIS

He used to pick fights at the gas

station.

RICH

And remember when he did all those donut

holes that one summer?

FRED

Just a bad seed.

FARRELL

How do you like our beer?

WILL

I like it fine.

FRED

What Detective Dormer needs is a little

shut-eye.

RICH

The white nights been hard on you?

WILL

They haven't been easy.

FRANCIS

They don't have titanium shades over at

the Pioneer.

RICH

Well no wonder.

FRANCIS

You lose all sense of time.

FARRELL

Better than Fred's home town.

FRED

My people are from Barrow.  Way up north.

RICH

In the winter there's no sunlight for

five straight months.

FRED

Like being swallowed up in a black hole.

ELLIE (O.S.)

Hi, guys.

FRED

Nancy Drew!  Pull up a seat!

FRANCIS

You hear what happened, Ellie?

ELLIE

Yeah.

RICH

Pretty cool.

FARRELL

Rich found the gun.

ELLIE

I know.  I heard.

FRED

Something's on Nancy's mind.

ELLIE

I found this out on the beach.

FARRELL

What is it?

ELLIE

Shell casing.  9mm.

FRANCIS

Let it go, Ell.  We got the bad guy.

ELLIE

None of us carries a 9mm duty weapon.

And the murder weapon was a 357.

RICH

Get a hobby, will ya?

ELLIE

It's a legitimate point, isn't it,

Detective Dormer?

WILL

It's legitimate.

ELLIE

Worth pursuing?

WILL

The case is closed, Ellie.

(gets up)

I got the next round.

ELLIE

Me, Pop!

ELLIE'S DAD

Ellie?  You okay?

ELLIE

Where's all my academy stuff?

WALTER

(smiles)

Hi, Will...

WILL

What the hell are you doing calling me at

the station?

WALTER

I figured we should touch base.  Compare

notes.  I think it went well.  What did

you think?

WILL

Randy Stetz is in jail.

WALTER

Told you I could write an ending.

WILL

Congratulations.

WILL (cont'd)

The tape.

WALTER

I thought maybe we could talk some more.

WILL

There's nothing more to talk about.

WALTER

But we work so well together...

WILL

We do nothing well together.

(SLAMS him again)

Nothing!  You understand me?

WALTER

You run on two settings, Will.  I've

noticed that...

WALTER (cont'd)

You jump from calm to rage in the blink

of an eye.  That's okay.  I do that too.

WALTER (cont'd)

You're not sleeping, are you?

WILL

What the hell do you know?

WALTER

Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know.

Tells me things.  About you.  About me.

WALTER (cont'd)

Does Detective Eckhart come to you?

WALTER (cont'd)

Does he ask you why you shot him?

WILL

I told you that was an accident!

WALTER

Then so was mine...

WILL

Don't you pull that shit with me.

WALTER

I didn't want to kill her, Will.

WALTER (cont'd)

When she called me that night from the

party, she'd had a fight with Randy.

Wanted to talk.  I told her to meet me at

our special place.  The cabin at the

beach...

WALTER (cont'd)

...When she came she was barefoot.  And

there was liquor on her breath.  I only

wanted to comfort her.  To touch her.

She could have at least let me do that.

Her skin...it was like everything I'd

ever written about.

WILL

Couldn't get it up, Walter?

WALTER

It was when I went to kiss her.  She

started laughing.  I got angry.  After

all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with

her.  I just wanted to make her stop.

That's all.

WALTER (cont'd)

From calm to rage in the blink of an eye.

WALTER (cont'd)

Remember?

WILL

Like this?

WALTER

Yes.  Like that.

WILL

This an accident, Walter?

WALTER

If you want it to be...

WILL

It took ten minutes to beat Kay Connell

to death.  Ten minutes.

WILL (cont'd)

Get the fuck out of town, Byrd.  Leave

and never come back.

WALTER

I have a summer house up by Kgun Lake.

I'm going to write my next novel there.

It's about a famous detective who goes

bad.

WALTER (cont'd)

Just kidding.

WALTER (cont'd)

The never coming back part, though.  I'm

not sure.  To tell you the truth this has

been kind of fun.  Going to the station,

meeting all those nice people.  Talking

with you.

WALTER (cont'd)

I might miss it.

WALTER (cont'd)

I especially like that new detective.

WALTER (cont'd)

Detective Burr.

(smiles)

I liked her very much.  Has a real

vitality.

CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)

I was hoping not to send you back with so

much paperwork, Will.

CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)

When are you taking off?

WILL

Six-thirty.

FRED

If Spencer's not too drunk to fly.

CHIEF NYBACK

Can't talk you into staying for a couple of

days?  Do some fishing?  Show you what

normally goes on around here.

WILL

I have to get back.

CHIEF NYBACK

Too bad...

CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)

...Brought some real class to the place.

But, Seattle needs its hero back.

(stands)

Couldn't have done it without you, Will.

WILL

Had a lot of help from Nightmute's

finest.

ELLIE

Didn't want to miss anything.

CHIEF NYBACK

Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few

hours.

ELLIE

Good.

CHIEF NYBACK

Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.

ELLIE

Sure.

ELLIE (cont'd)

I thought what you did on this case was

amazing.

ELLIE (cont'd)

We're really going to miss you around

here.

RACHEL

I found a new friend.

RACHEL (cont'd)

Will.  What is it?

ELLIE

Very funny, Farrell...

ELLIE

Hi, Rachel.

RACHEL

I would have seen if he came back.

ELLIE

Detective Dormer?

RACHEL

What is all this?

WALTER (O.S.)

Here to visit me?

WILL

No.

WILL (cont'd)

I'm here to end this.

WALTER

Where's your back-up?

WILL

No back-up.

WALTER

You're not following procedure.

WILL

Procedure went out the window a long time

ago.

WALTER

We're on the same side, Will.  You know

that.  After what we've been through

together.  We're partners.  Bound by a

secret.

WILL

That's where you're wrong, Walter.

WILL (cont'd)

There is no secret.  Because the biggest

difference between you and me is what we

will or will not live with...

WALTER

Will...

WALTER

You give the police a bad name, Will.

ELLIE

Shit!

WILL

(softly)

Walter?

WILL (cont'd)

Walter!

WALTER

Wild card.

WILL

Drop the gun, Walter.

WALTER

That jammed the last time, remember?

WILL

Another J. Brody mystery.

ELLIE (O.S.)

Detective Dormer!

WILL

God, you're a pain in the ass.

ELLIE

You're shot.

WILL

You, too.

ELLIE

I'm going to make a tourniquet.

WILL

Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her

things are in the house.

ELLIE

I know.

WILL

Byrd's dead.

ELLIE

You shot Detective Eckhart, didn't you?

WILL

Yes.

ELLIE

Did you mean to?

WILL

No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.

ELLIE

Why?

WILL

Because I just couldn't be wrong.

(looks at her)

Don't ever get that way, Ellie.  Don't

ever lose your way.  It blurs the line.

ELLIE

This one looks worse.

WILL

(whispers)

Just let me sleep, Ellie...

WILL (cont'd)

Let me sleep.

ELLIE

No!

ELLIE (cont'd)

I will not let you sleep.  If you've lost

your way then you have to make it right.

That's the only way.  That's what you'd

tell me.  I've been a detective for four

weeks and I say you're coming with me.

ELLIE (cont'd)

C'mon...

WILL

What about your shoulder?

ELLIE

Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.

FADE OUT.
