JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Feels like nothin'. Nah, it feels

BOBBY GREEN

That's them there. In the corner.

Lookit `em--two peas in a pod.

ROSARIO DIAZ

Yeah--I see `em! They don't look

that bad though, you know? For

cops?

(re: Michael, Jack)

Who're those other guys?

BOBBY GREEN

[My] Father's friends--they were

all in Korea together.

(with a laugh)

Biggest bunch of fuckin' stiffs...

(moves closer)

Look, don't talk to nobody, we'll

get out quicker.

ROSARIO DIAZ

(beat; darkening)

I ain't gonna embarrass you.

BOBBY GREEN

This's my brother. And my father.

BURT GRUSINSKY

We gotta talk to you. Alone.

MICHAEL SOLO

In a house of God, no less? C'mon,

MICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D)

Hello, Bobby. Nice suit you got on.

(CONTINUED)

11.

BURT GRUSINSKY

Your hair's long.

BOBBY GREEN

I know. I like it this way.

(no response, so:)

That why you got me up here?    [To]

tell me my hair's too long?

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Bobby, I asked Pop to bring you

here.

BOBBY GREEN

Whatsamatter?

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Well... I'm gonna be heading up a

new narcotics team, starting this

week. A Russian unit, outta PSA 2

in Brighton.

BOBBY GREEN

(lights a cigarette)

That's a good hook for you.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Yeah, they need me over there.

There's only eleven guys in the

whole department that even know the

language right now, so...

BOBBY GREEN

You ever talk?

JACK SHAPIRO

I'm old-fashioned. I listen first.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Bobby, we need you to do us a

favor.

BOBBY GREEN

(SMIRKING)

A favor? Oh, he needs a favor!

(to Burt, needling)

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

12.

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

You cut me off financially, and now

you need the favor? `S interesting.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

PUDGE--

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)

We're looking at this guy Vadim

Nezhinski.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (O.C.) (CONT'D)

Served time in the Soviet Union for

black market activity, come over

around 1979.

BOBBY GREEN

`S good lookin' boy!

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

He's dealing H, cocaine, angel

dust... Operates out of that club

you manage. The El Caribe.

BOBBY GREEN

I don't know nothing about that.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

No, we know that. We checked up

and down the rest of management,

too--his uncle, the owner--

BOBBY GREEN

The old man?! What, you been

watching us?!?

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Everybody come up clean. It's just

Nezhinski we're lookin' at.

BOBBY GREEN

(back to Burt)

What the fuck is this?

(CONTINUED)

13.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

We need to track how he's bringin'

in the product and...we were just

hopin' you'd keep your eyes and

ears open a little.

BOBBY GREEN

You kidding me? Inform for you?!?

That's what you wanted me here for?

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

No, we would never ask you to do

that. Just observe, that's all.

It's a closed community and you're

our only way in right now--

BOBBY GREEN

Yeah well, find another way. I got

a lot invested in that club and I

can't let it get fucked up.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Nothing's gonna get fucked up,

Bobby. All it takes is one thing,

you know that! One guy to flip, we

crack the whole thing!

MICHAEL SOLO

Bobby, it's important. These ain't

dumb guys we're talking about. We

don't stop `em up front, coupla

years from now, it'll be chaos out

there.

(BEAT)

We'd be wishing the Italians'd come

back.

BOBBY GREEN

[You] Fuckin' broadsided me...

Everything's about the goddamned

job with you.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Whole city's falling apart, Bobby--

don't you got any sense of

responsibility at all?

(CONTINUED)

14.

BOBBY GREEN

C'mon... Get off your fuckin' high

horse and bust somebody else's

balls.

BURT GRUSINSKY

(finally, to Joseph)

All right, go downstairs. Lemme

talk to him.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Thanks for coming.

BOBBY GREEN

You're welcome.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Just be careful out there next

coupla weeks.

BOBBY GREEN

'S that supposed to mean?!?

BURT GRUSINSKY

Joseph!

BOBBY GREEN

Congratulations. You got me up

here.

BURT GRUSINSKY

I knew you wouldn't help us. I

told your brother, I said, `no

point even bringing him down here.'

BOBBY GREEN

Good.   Then now you know.

BURT GRUSINSKY

Hold on a second--lemme ask you a

question. That girl of yours

downstairs--she Puerto Rican?

BOBBY GREEN

Yeah.   I like the dark meat.

(CONTINUED)

15.

BURT GRUSINSKY

She hooking you up?

BOBBY GREEN

(lets out a chuckle)

Why, you want some?

BURT GRUSINSKY

Yeah, keep laughing--your mother,

rest in peace, I think she was too

easy on you.

BOBBY GREEN

I gotta go, Pop. I'll see you

`round.

SPIRO GIAVANNIS

Everyone?   Everyone!

ROSARIO DIAZ

You take a picture, it'll last

longer.

BOBBY GREEN

C'mon, let's get outta here,

[we'll] go party with Jumbo.

ROSARIO DIAZ

We could stay if you want, baby.

They don't like me, I don't care--

you're better than them anyway--

BOBBY GREEN

(waves her off)

We're goin'. C'mon.

(CONTINUED)

16.

SPIRO GIAVANNIS

I'm Deputy Commissioner Spiro

GIAVANNIS--

SPIRO GIAVANNIS (CONT'D)

You know, we look around in these

troubled times, and in moments like

this we need leaders, men and women

who can bring order back to our

great communities. We're here this

holiday season to give thanks for

one of these men, our Russian

brother, Joseph Grusinsky.

SPIRO GIAVANNIS (CONT'D)

...Joseph, many of us've known your

father, Deputy Chief Burt

Grusinsky, for many years, and I

know he wants to say a little

something. Chief?

BURT GRUSINSKY

Thank you. You know, I used to

tell my kids, "work first, play

later," and my son Joseph really

took it to heart. He's been a real

fighter over the years... He

overcome his mother's passing, and

the dyslexia--eventually wound up

graduating John Jay as salutatorian

and distinguished himself many

times.

(turns to Joseph)

Anyway, you've shown yourself to be

very brave and selfless, and I'm

just, I'm very proud here tonight.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Thank you everybody for coming--

happy Thanksgiving. Before I say

anything else... We got some bad

news this morning.

(CONTINUED)

17.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)

One of our Irish brothers was

killed in the line of duty last

night--detective Edward Conlon was

gunned down serving a warrant on

Northern Boulevard. The clock's

about to strike ten, so I thought

we might give a moment of silence

to remember.

ROSARIO DIAZ

I'm gonna be like Madonna. You

think I'm like Madonna...?

ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D)

We're both Leos, you know.

BOBBY GREEN

You're just like her, baby...

(CONTINUED)

18.

ROSARIO DIAZ

I talked to my mother yesterday.

She said she'd be okay by herself,

so I could move in if I want...

BOBBY GREEN

That's cool.

ROSARIO DIAZ

(without self-pity)

Your family ain't gonna be too

happy, though. I saw how they

looked at me.

BOBBY GREEN

It's all right--they don't like

nobody outside their own little

world.

ROSARIO DIAZ

Yeah...you know, cops're fucked up.

In my neighborhood, if they ain't

taking money, they're beating on

you for no reason...

BOBBY GREEN

My brother and my father ain't like

that. It's just--the whole thing

ain't for me, that's all.

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

You know how gorgeous you are?

ROSARIO DIAZ

WAIT--

(CONTINUED)

19.

ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D)

I got you something.

BOBBY GREEN

What is it?

ROSARIO DIAZ

Open it up!

BOBBY GREEN

...it's beautiful...

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

...you're so good to me...

ROSARIO DIAZ

I love you... And someday we're

gonna get a big house together, in

New Jersey, with a lotta kids...

BOBBY GREEN

Only if you behave yourself...

BOBBY GREEN

Uh oh--[The] party's really gonna

get started now!

LOUIS FALSETTI

Yeah--let's all play Spin my

Pickle!

FREDDIE

Hey Falsetti!    You get what we

wanted?

(CONTINUED)

20.

LOUIS FALSETTI

(GRINNING)

Indeed I did, my friend!

(quieter, to Bobby)

See, I woulda been here sooner,

`cept I hadda go across town, lose

all the cops--

HAZEL

There weren't no cops following us!

LOUIS FALSETTI

Shut your mouth! You wouldn't

recognize `em--they were, they were

all undercover.

LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)

Anyway, I got a little of what

everybody asked for here. I got

uppers, downers, hash, mescaline,

some blow-

BOBBY GREEN

Any Spanish Fly in there for you?

LOUIS FALSETTI

Yeah, you need that, not me!

LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)

And what's with the suit anyway?

You look like a monkey in the

circus!

BOBBY GREEN

I'm goin' up to see Buzhayev

tonight. I think he's gonna ask me

to buy into the club.

LOUIS FALSETTI

Yeah? Well, you know what you

should do, you should turn it into

a fag joint and then maybe they'll

let ya in!

(CONTINUED)

21.

BOBBY GREEN

I'll show you a fuckin' faggot!

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

Everybody, I gotta be at El Caribe

in an hour, so get ready!

MICHAEL SOLO

The spot's got one main entrance,

two rear fire exits. All of `em'll

be covered.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Good. I just wanna make sure we

take it easy in there. We don't

want no panic.

JACK SHAPIRO

What if your brother's inside?

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

It's his day off. He ain't gonna

be there.

MICHAEL SOLO

What if he is?    We still go?

MICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D)

What's it gonna be?

22.

KALINA BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE)

Bobby! Our daughter and her

husband Eli come by for dinner.

You want something, some tea?

BOBBY GREEN

No no, I'm all right... Hi

everybody...

BOBBY GREEN

Everything's really rockin'

tonight. Line's halfway `round the

block.

MARAT BUZHAYEV

Yes, it's good...

BOBBY GREEN

You wanted to talk to me?

MARAT BUZHAYEV

You know, maybe we open another

spot next year. Across from

Brighton.

(CONTINUED)

23.

BOBBY GREEN

'S a good move.

MARAT BUZHAYEV

We need someone in charge here full-

time, then. And we think you do a

great job.

BOBBY GREEN

I appreciate that. You know, I

been thinking `bout it--I'd like to

become a partner here too--buy in

with you.

(BEAT)

I mean, I got a lot of ideas.

KALINA BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE)

(EXCITED)

Already! He's got so many ideas!

BOBBY GREEN

Well, I just think we could do

more. Maybe expand into Sheepshead

Bay. I know a good spot--we add a

restaurant there, get the spill-

over. Like what your brother did,

in Miami.

ELI MIRICHENKO

That's gonna take a lot of money,

Papa. Your fur business can

support that right now?

MARAT BUZHAYEV

My son-in-law, he worries people

take advantage of me.

BOBBY GREEN

I can understand that. But I got

money to invest--we could make it

something real special over there.

Do what I did downstairs--you know,

bring in name DJs on different

nights?

(BEAT)

What do you think?

(CONTINUED)

24.

MARAT BUZHAYEV

Yes. Together we do it. You come

to our Thanksgiving again, on

Thursday?

BOBBY GREEN

Yeah, sure.   I'll come.

MARAT BUZHAYEV

Good--we talk more, at the dinner.

MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D)

Give him, for tonight!

BOBBY GREEN

Nah nah, no thank you...

LOUIS FALSETTI

My brother! How'd it go?

(Bobby smiles, winks)

Ho, well! I'm guessing it went

pretty good then!

BOBBY GREEN

Listen--I get this done, I want you

to be a host. In one of our spots.

LOUIS FALSETTI

That's my specialty. I'm whaddaya

call, a people person!

BOBBY GREEN

Well, just make sure you get your

old co-workers from the Health

Department to give us a pass on the

kitchen.

(CONTINUED)

25.

LOUIS FALSETTI

Yeah, no problem--half of `em got

rats as pets anyway.

BOBBY GREEN

Where's Rosario?

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

Goddamnit... [She's] With that

fuckin' animal again.

LOUIS FALSETTI

She's a player, Bob. You know how

it goes.

BOBBY GREEN

Look at him... I'll tell you,

[when] this is my place, we'll kick

his fuckin' ass right outta here--

LOUIS FALSETTI

(FLUSTERED)

Bob! You gotta watch your mouth!

I mean, he don't scare me, but uh,

but trust me, I know.

BOBBY GREEN

Yeah, you know a lot.

LOUIS FALSETTI

I do, I'm serious!

(moves closer)

Last year, one of his guys was

gonna flip? Jesus Christ, what I

saw...

CUT TO:

26.

LOUIS FALSETTI

Nezhinski dragged him into the

toilet. They stood him up against

the wall and held him--

LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)

They fuckin' pulled down his pants,

and I swear to God, Nezhinski just

cut it off.

LOUIS FALSETTI

Worst thing I ever seen in my life,

Bob.

(BEAT)

Anyway, cops found his head in the

middle of Brighton Avenue the next

day--fuckin' dick was in his mouth.

BOBBY GREEN

You sure it wasn't your dick?

LOUIS FALSETTI

Yeah, that's funny.

(BEAT)

You sure it wasn't your mouth?

BOBBY GREEN

Shit... I'll be right back.

(CONTINUED)

27.

ROSARIO DIAZ

Hi, honey!

VADIM NEZHINSKI

Bobby--c'mon, join us! I wanna

talk to you!

VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)

This is the fuckin' guy right here.

Practically owns the place.

VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)

Everything all right with you?

BOBBY GREEN

(nods; then, coolly:)

Things're goin' good.

VADIM NEZHINSKI

That's real good... `Cause you

gotta be happy, you know? All my

guys, I tell `em, the mind and the

body, they're connected. That's

how you stay sharp.

PAVEL LUBYARSKY

This's "Kid Quick" you're talking

to, dude. Best fuckin'

middleweight in the Ukraine.

BOBBY GREEN

He don't look like a middleweight

no more.

(CONTINUED)

28.

VADIM NEZHINSKI

You know Bobby, my uncle upstairs,

he, he likes you a lot. Practically

thinks you're one of his kids.

BOBBY GREEN

Your uncle's a great man. Smart

man.

VADIM NEZHINSKI

Yeah... Smart smart stupid. Got

his head buried in books all day,

`stead of the real world...

VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)

Listen uh, I come to you, I tell

you I got some friends bringin' a

load in here, maybe something big--

I'm just talking now--they bring it

in, how do you feel about that?

BOBBY GREEN

Your uncle loses his license, he

ain't gonna be too happy.

VADIM NEZHINSKI

Well, upstairs don't gotta know

everything, am I right? Place gets

packed every night, everybody wins.

VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)

You know, you should think about

comin' in with us. You're popular--

you could help us...expand a

little. A lotta money in it.

BOBBY GREEN

Yeah...I'll think about that.

Rosario--I wanna talk to you.

VADIM NEZHINSKI

Go ahead.   We'll talk.

(CONTINUED)

29.

ROSARIO DIAZ

It go good upstairs, baby?

BOBBY GREEN

You gotta stop dealing. You hear

what I'm telling you?

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

You hear what I said?

ROSARIO DIAZ

Yeah, I heard. But I need the

money right now, Bobby. And I'm

not gonna rely on you for

EVERYTHING--

BOBBY GREEN

Just hold off then, for a little

while. Okay? I got my reasons.

ROSARIO DIAZ

I love you...

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Everybody! Get your hands on your

head and don't fuckin' move!

Turn off that music. Right now!

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Give everybody a toss. G.Q.--

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)

Too much pizza, right there.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)

Turn around...    Turn around!

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)

What is this?

(BEAT)

Want me to double your money? Huh?

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)

Okay.   It's doubled now, how's

32.

LOUIS FALSETTI

Jesus, that cop's crazy!

UNIFORMED COP

Hey! Fat Albert! Shut your

fuckin' mouth!

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (SUBTITLE)

You got a cross AND a Jewish star

on you?

VADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE)

The cross is for good luck.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

What's the star for?

VADIM NEZHINSKI

That one's for God.

MICHAEL SOLO

Coupla dimes on `em--cocaine, a

little PCP.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Okay, let's go. You. And you--

(to the Young Man)

You're under arrest, possession and

sale of narcotics--

33.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)

Your boy's gonna turn. And then

we'll come back for you.

PORTLY COP

UNIFORMED COP

BURT GRUSINSKY

Where you going? I was the one who

got you outta there!

(CONTINUED)

34.

BOBBY GREEN

Thanks a lot.    I appreciate it.

BURT GRUSINSKY

You're a real big shot, aren't you!

You see what happened in there last

night? Hey--I'm talking to you!

BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)

You know, you and your

girlfriend're only getting off

`cause of your brother. Up to me,

you'd sit in there another couple

days.

BOBBY GREEN

Okay, I'll go thank him too then.

He comes in, raids the fuckin'

place--now I gotta go beg `em not

to fire me--

BURT GRUSINSKY

Fire you?! From what? Probably

the best thing that ever happened

to you!

BOBBY GREEN

Fuck you, Pop.    Fuck the both of

you's.

BURT GRUSINSKY

Don't EVER speak to me like that

again. You hear me? I'll rap you

right in the mouth!

fuckin' touch me?!?

MARAT BUZHAYEV

No no--it's okay. Say hello...

MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D)

Now--we go this week to the field,

okay? To ride the horses? Go to

Mama.

BOBBY GREEN

Mr. Buzhayev... I'm real sorry

about what happened the other

night.

(BEAT)

[If] I was working, maybe I

would've been able to do something,

but... Anyway, I'm sorry.

MARAT BUZHAYEV

It's not your fault...

MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D)

You can't always control everyone

in your family...

(BEAT)

My nephew, he don't come back to

the club anymore.

(CONTINUED)

36.

BOBBY GREEN

You don't mind my saying, I think

that's probably the right thing to

do.

(BEAT)

Things get back to normal, I'm

hoping we could get started on what

we talked about.

MARAT BUZHAYEV

(shakes his head)

We need time for the bad publicity

to go away.

BOBBY GREEN

Mr. Buzhayev, my getting arrested

ain't gonna be a problem. I don't

got a record--

MARAT BUZHAYEV

I know.   I don't worry about any of

that.

MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D)

I used to teach chemistry before I

come over here, and now I have the

fur store, and this. One thing I

learned here, you can always start

over. So don't worry--someday, we

do it. Okay? Someday.

BOBBY GREEN

Yeah...   All right...

KALINA BUZHAYEV (O.C.; SUBTITLE)

Food is ready!

MARAT BUZHAYEV

You take some time off, everything

We had to go--I'm sorry.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Nezhinski was seen there, Bobby!

What am I supposed to do--announce

it in advance, compromise the whole

thing?

(BEAT)

C'mon.

BOBBY GREEN

I had plans down there.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Yeah, well, I tried. What do you

want from me, anyway? You know,

you're standing there feeling sorry

for yourself, but you wouldn't be

in this shit if you didn't fuck

around in the first place.

BOBBY GREEN

You got real balls saying that to

me. I made something for myself,

and you come in and fuck it up?

Just `cause I'm not trying to be

like you? And Pop--

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)

Hello, your honor. Commissioner.

Thank you for coming.

MAYOR

Chief Grusinsky, an attack on an

Whoever did this, in a clean

MICHAEL SOLO

Listen, I ain't judging you--I

called you `cause I thought you had

be doing after the trial?

(CONTINUED)

78.

BOBBY GREEN

I'm not sure yet... We been

Miami. Guy I used to work for, his

brother's got a place down there.

SPIRO GIAVANNIS

Gee, that's great. Well listen,

SANDRA GRUSINSKY

Everyone, let's, let's move inside--

BURT GRUSINSKY

Joseph--we got some things we need

chance.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

We could do it now if you want,

Pop. In the den.

ROSARIO DIAZ

Bobby, I'm gonna go back to the

motel.

BOBBY GREEN

What're you talking about? They

got a lot of food over there--why

don't you go eat something?

ROSARIO DIAZ

N--I'm gonna go back.

BOBBY GREEN

You fucked up?

BURT GRUSINSKY

Bobby--you should hear this too,

for the trial.

BOBBY GREEN

We gotta straighten this out later.

81.

MICHAEL SOLO

Nezhinski's cache was huge, about

40 keys--yayo, some angel dust too.

BURT GRUSINSKY

We're gonna try and turn him, get

him to tell us how they're bringing

it in. But don't worry--we'll make

sure he does plenty of time.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

He ain't gonna be reliable, Pop.

BURT GRUSINSKY

Well, you marry an ape, you don't

complain about the stench of

bananas.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Where is he?

JACK SHAPIRO

He's at Rikers. Tucked in, nice

and comfy. We're taking him to the

A.D.A. next week, for a meeting.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

I wanna go with you on that. See

his fuckin' face.

MICHAEL SOLO

I'll tell you, though--streets're

dead. Junkies're waitin' out there

for something big, no question.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

That's `cause we got their number

one. Dried it up at the source.

BOBBY GREEN

That don't mean nothing.

(CONTINUED)

BURT GRUSINSKY

What's that, Bobby?

BOBBY GREEN

There's a whole network full of

suppliers. The organization goes

deep.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Bobby--you done a lot for us

already. You don't gotta get

involved in this anymore. Okay?

BURT GRUSINSKY

I asked him to come in, Joe. If

he's gonna have to testify, he

should know all this.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

This's police business, Pop--you

gonna make him an honorary member

of the Force now?

BOBBY GREEN

I'll be outside if you need me.

BURT GRUSINSKY

BOBBY--

(SOTTO)

What was said in there, he--he

didn't mean it.

BOBBY GREEN

Well, why's he goin' back to work

so soon, anyway? He ain't ready.

BURT GRUSINSKY

And I think maybe...considering the

alternatives...

(BEAT)

BOBBY GREEN

POP--

BURT GRUSINSKY

I could pull some strings, get you

LEAVE--

BOBBY GREEN

No, come on! I don't want that!

Sure, Bobkes. I mean, she come

ROSARIO DIAZ

Wait!   Lemme get my coat at least!

LOUIS FALSETTI

You know Bob, everyone's been

surprised to hear about your family-

-I mean, your father's like J.

Edgar Hoover--

BOBBY GREEN

Yeah--we'll talk later, buddy--I'll

call you. But right now I need to

get her outta here.

BOBBY GREEN

You gotta put everything in

jeopardy? Huh?

ROSARIO DIAZ

No! I was just dancing! I didn't

BOBBY GREEN

You know, I don't think you realize

how serious this is?

86.

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

We gotta ride this out, `til this

ROSARIO DIAZ

Bobby, what do you want from me? I

can't go out, I can't do nothing--

it's like I'm in a jail--

BOBBY GREEN

I know. But I'm workin' on it, I

am.

(looks around; then)

Soon as the trial's over and I get

my money back outta impound--

everything'll get better, you'll

see.

ROSARIO DIAZ

It's just, I feel...I feel like

it's just you and all those cops

all the time. And they look at me

like I'm a piece of shit.

BOBBY GREEN

Rosario--once this's done, we'll go

down to Miami... [It'll] be a new

thing for us--a lotta

opportunities...

(BEAT)

I'll talk to Mr. Buzhayev about

working for his brother down there.

We'll get your mother to come too--

FADE OUT.

JACK SHAPIRO

You got it...

MARAT BUZHAYEV (O.S.)

We heard all about you in the news.

We were all very sorry about your

brother.

BOBBY GREEN

Thank you... You know Mr.

Buzhayev, I come to see you today

`cause...with everything that's

gone on, I don't think it's a good

idea for me to stay in New York

anymore. I was hoping maybe you

could ask your brother if I could

work with him, down in Miami. On

his restaurant.

MARAT BUZHAYEV

I could talk to him. I think he

would like you very much.

(CONTINUED)

88.

BOBBY GREEN

I'd appreciate it.

MARAT BUZHAYEV

We're going to be very sad if

you're going. Having you here in

this house meant a lot to us. You

know, my wife and me, we have only

daughters.

BOBBY GREEN

You always been very important to

me too.

(checks his watch)

I should probably go now.

MARAT BUZHAYEV

Bobby--you'll always be welcome

back here.

VADIM NEZHINSKI

They did good.    On his face.

JACK SHAPIRO

Shut your fuckin' mouth.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

He makes a deal today, maybe my

brother don't gotta take the

stand... Least that's something...

JACK SHAPIRO

Give me that lighter.

BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)

Jesus! Listen to me--you and Jack

get someplace safe. Let ESU take

care of it--I'm gonna go get your

brother.

ROSARIO DIAZ

You know, my Aunt's in Miami. We

probably could stay with her for a

little bit `til we get settled.

BOBBY GREEN

Yeah, maybe. Why don't we give `em

all these bags to throw out--it's

becoming a mess.

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

What's goin' on?

BURT GRUSINSKY

Nezhinski's out.

BOBBY GREEN

What--?

BURT GRUSINSKY

Your brother was taking him to the

A.D.A. and they got ambushed. They

hit three of our guys.

BOBBY GREEN

Jesus...   What about--

BURT GRUSINSKY

Your brother's fine. We gotta get

BOBBY GREEN

You see something out there?

BURT GRUSINSKY

Nah, we're good. It's just, I just

realized--I know this neighborhood.

I used to come with my father, to

work on the plumbing, for the

Anyway, it's all changed now.

closer together someday.

BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)

Once this is over, you and your

brother, you'll talk, you'll work

things out.

BOBBY GREEN

Yeah, maybe.   But you know the way

he is.

BURT GRUSINSKY

Bobby--your brother, I think he

probably feels a little guilty,

with everything you did, with you

in protection now... But he

appreciates what you've done--I

know he does.

BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)

Look, I'm just trying to keep us

together here, that's all. That's

all I want.

BOBBY GREEN

(relents a bit; nods)

I know, Pop.

BURT GRUSINSKY

everything yourself. That's what

I'm trying to tell you.

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

Joe, what's wrong? Come on, you

can tell me.

(BEAT)

A deal this big, something's gonna

come up. You'll see--someone'll

fold.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

a little responsible.

BOBBY GREEN

Nah, you didn't do nothing. It's

meant to be. You can't fuckin'

control it...

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

(slight laugh)

You know, I remember when Pop was

mad at you, he always used to say

you didn't believe in our family.

And Mom, she'd protect you. She'd

give you those little caramels...

Anyway, I knew he was wrong too,

LOUIS FALSETTI

Florida?

(BEAT)

Well, she probably just needed a

little time for herself. She'll be

back.

BOBBY GREEN

Yeah...

(more interior)

You know, I was just thinking `bout

when I first met her here...

Working back there...

LOUIS FALSETTI

Ah, don't worry, Bob. I have no

doubt she'll be back.

LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)

I mean, between you and me, that

place they had you in was drivin'

her crazy. The Kew Motor Inn--we

used to call that the SCREW Motor

Inn, with all the hookers...

BOBBY GREEN

How'd you know where I was staying?

LOUIS FALSETTI

Huh?

BOBBY GREEN

How'd you know where I was staying?

LOUIS FALSETTI

(CAUGHT)

It was, it was in the papers...

BOBBY GREEN

It wasn't in no papers, Louis.

Don't make me embarrass you. Let's

go outside, right now.

BOBBY GREEN

Where's Nezhinski?

LOUIS FALSETTI

I don't know--

BOBBY GREEN

Don't play games with me, Louis.

LOUIS FALSETTI

BOBBY GREEN

You don't mean nothing to me now--

that part of my life is dead.

(beat; for himself)

Today it ended for good...

LOUIS FALSETTI

Bobby I swear--I don't know

nothing!

BOBBY GREEN

You know my father is dead because

of you?

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

You know I'm on the Force now? And

I could do anything to you?

LOUIS FALSETTI

No, wait! Bob, please!

(beat; weakening)

Don't do this to me...

(even softer)

Don't do this to me Bob, please...

BOBBY GREEN

You tell me what you know right now

or I swear to Christ I will make

you disappear.

LOUIS FALSETTI

Bobby, I... I told `em where you

were--but, but it ain't what you

think! I was makin' a buy and

these guys in hoods, they held a

gun to my head--so I tried to give

`em the wrong information!

(CONTINUED)

119.

LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)

No, wait, listen! It's true!

Rosario tol' me you moved every

couple days, she said you was gonna

move--I thought you'd be gone by

then! It's the truth, Bobby! I

would never try and hurt you!

Never, swear to God!

BOBBY GREEN

You tell me, right now--

(BEAT)

Where's your fuckin' spot?!?

AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN

I got your money man, but my shit's

AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN

Yeah?   When's that gonna be?

MAN'S VOICE

ELI MIRICHENKO

After tomorrow, everybody's gonna

get well.

COP'S VOICE (O.S.)

We got your boy Eli completely

covered, Bobby.

TOUGH-LOOKING COP

He just turned in for the night.

(BEAT)

Can't move an inch without us up

his ass.

BOBBY GREEN

Well, he said tomorrow and that's

what matters.

TOUGH-LOOKING COP

And we'll be right there with him--

you can be sure of that.

MICHAEL SOLO

They're movin' serious weight, we

might be talkin' major league

firepower. Maybe we call in the

Feds.

JACK SHAPIRO

The Feds?

MICHAEL SOLO

Each one of `em's got 25 years on

the job with this kinda thing,

Pudge.

BOBBY GREEN

They got one year of experience,

repeated 25 times.

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

Pop would never bring `em in, Joe.

We gotta see this through

ourselves...

JACK SHAPIRO

Bobby's right.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Yeah, definitely... We'll get the

TAC plan together...

Arright, guys.    That's it for now.

JACK SHAPIRO

JOE--

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Yeah?

JACK SHAPIRO

You know, they're laughin' at us,

out there on the street. Now when

we get there, it'll be up to you

what we do. But I hope you think

about droppin' the hammer on `em.

(CONTINUED)

122.

JACK SHAPIRO (CONT'D)

I mean--after your father and

everything? These people're like

fuckin' lice.

(BEAT)

Just think about what I'm saying to

you.

BOBBY GREEN

All right, c'mon. Enough...

(CONTINUED)

123.

BOBBY GREEN

We're gonna get all of `em today.

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

Lookit the two of them...they're so

fuckin' close...

MICHAEL SOLO

Okay--when they complete the sale,

that's when we move. ESU'll grab

the kids.

MARAT BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE)

for so long. My nephew has stayed

just to see this through.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

124.

MARAT BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE)

When this is done, we'll control

almost the whole market.

(motions to Man)

Each load is completely

untraceable. It's my own method.

VADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE)

The rest of the product is in the

van--total weight, 75 kilos.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

The deal's closing--let's go!

Come out now, with your hands on

your heads!

clearing.

MAN'S VOICE

Bobby?   What're you doin'--

BOBBY GREEN

VADIM NEZHINSKI

Don't...don't let me die in here...

MARAT BUZHAYEV

Bobby--I, I didn't know it would be

your family--

BOBBY GREEN

Get down!   On the ground!

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

Put him in the fuckin' van...

Don't touch him...

RANDOM OFFICERS

Bobby! Hey! Lookit you--six

months in the Academy and already

you look like a chief!

BOBBY GREEN

Hey everybody...

MICHAEL SOLO

I just saw the commissioner. A

lotta people're gonna wanna talk to

you--important people. About maybe

settin' you up with your own unit.

BOBBY GREEN

All right.   We'll talk about that

after.

BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

They're getting started--we should

probably go in now.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

You know, I think Pop would be real

happy to see you like this.

BOBBY GREEN

(slight ironic laugh)

I don't think he'd believe it...

But I guess things don't always go

the way you think they will.

(CONTINUED)

131.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Ah, the Force'll treat you good.

I'm sure you do very well.

BOBBY GREEN

You definitely gonna leave? Ain't

no way you change your mind?

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

It's the right thing. It's over

for me--I'm out.

BOBBY GREEN

Listen, we'll spend some more time

together from now on. Okay? I'll

come over next week.

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

Arright, yeah.    Sounds good.

BOBBY GREEN

Chaplain? I'd like you to

introduce me this way. If you

don't mind.

begin today's ceremony with the

traditional invocation, moving then

to the valedictorian address to be

given by...Robert Grusinsky. Son

POLICE CHAPLAIN (CONT'D)

You know, as I look at this fine

young man seated here, I can't help

but think about all the young

members of our department. I get

filled with such pride.

Men like him are the great future

of our Force...
