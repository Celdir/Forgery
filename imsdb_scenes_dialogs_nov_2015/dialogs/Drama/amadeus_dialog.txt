AMADEUS

"AMADEUS"

by

Peter Shaffer

Final Draft

OLD SALIERI

Mozart! Mozart! Mozart. Forgive me!

Forgive your assassin! Mozart!

OLD SALIERI

Show some mercy! I beg you. I beg

you! Show mercy to a guilty man!

VALET

Open the door, Signore! Please! Be

good now! We've brought you something

special. Something you're going to

love.

VALET

Signore Salieri! Open the door. Come

now. Be good!

OLD SALIERI

Mozart! Mozart! I confess it! Listen!

I confess!

OLD SALIERI

Mozart! Mozart! I cannot bear it any

longer! I confess! I confess what I

did! I'm guilty! I killed you! Sir

I confess! I killed you!

OLD SALIERI

Mozart, perdonami! Forgive your

assassin! Piet! Piet! Forgive your

assassin! Forgive me! Forgive!

Forgive!

VALET

(looking up to the

window)

That's all right, Signore! He heard

you! He forgave you! He wants you to

go inside now and shut the window!

VALET

Come on, Signore! Look what I have

for you! I can't give it to you from

down here, can I?

BYSTANDER

Who is that?

VALET

No one, sir. He'll be all right.

Poor man. He's a little unhappy, you

know.

CUT TO:

VALET

Did he open?

VALET

Here I am, Signore. Now open the

door.

VALET

Mmmm - this is good! This is the

most delicious thing I ever ate,

believe me! Signore, you don't know

what you're missing! Mmmm!

VALET

Now that's enough, Signore! Open!

VALET

If you don't open this door, we're

going to eat everything. There'll be

nothing left for you. And I'm not

going to bring you anything more.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR GULDEN

He's going to live. It's much harder

to cut your throat than most people

imagine.

DOCTOR GULDEN

Here we are. Do you wish me to come

in with you?

VOGLER

No, Doctor. Thank you.

VOGLER

Herr Salieri?

OLD SALIERI

What do you want?

VOGLER

I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain

here. I thought you might like to

talk to someone.

OLD SALIERI

About what?

VOGLER

You tried to take your life. You do

remember that, don't you?

OLD SALIERI

So?

VOGLER

In the sight of God that is a sin.

OLD SALIERI

What do you want?

VOGLER

Do you understand that you have

sinned? Gravely.

OLD SALIERI

Leave me alone.

VOGLER

I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

OLD SALIERI

Do you know who I am? You never heard

of me, did you?

VOGLER

That makes no difference. All men

are equal in God's eyes.

OLD SALIERI

Are they?

VOGLER

Offer me your confession. I can offer

you God's forgiveness.

OLD SALIERI

I do not seek forgiveness.

VOGLER

My son, there is something dreadful

on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm

here only for you. Please talk to

me.

OLD SALIERI

How well are you trained in music?

VOGLER

I know a little. I studied it in my

youth.

OLD SALIERI

Where?

VOGLER

Here in Vienna.

OLD SALIERI

Then you must know this.

VOGLER

I can't say I do. What is it?

OLD SALIERI

I'm surprised you don't know. It was

a very popular tune in its day. I

wrote it. How about this?

OLD SALIERI

This one brought down the house when

we played it first.

CUT TO:

OLD SALIERI

(taking his hands off

the keys)

Well?

VOGLER

I regret it is not too familiar.

OLD SALIERI

Can you recall no melody of mine? I

was the most famous composer in Europe

when you were still a boy. I wrote

forty operas alone. What about this

little thing?

VOGLER

Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I

didn't know you wrote that.

OLD SALIERI

I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang

Amadeus Mozart. You know who that

is?

VOGLER

Of course. The man you accuse yourself

of killing.

OLD SALIERI

Ah - you've heard that?

VOGLER

All Vienna has heard that.

OLD SALIERI

( eagerly)

And do they believe it?

VOGLER

Is it true?

OLD SALIERI

Do you believe it?

VOGLER

Should I?

VOGLER

For God's sake, my son, if you have

anything to confess, do it now!

Give yourself some peace!

VOGLER

Do you hear me?

OLD SALIERI

He was murdered, Father! Mozart!

Cruelly murdered.

VOGLER

(almost whispering)

Yes? Did you do it?

OLD SALIERI

He was my idol! I can't remember a

time when I didn't know his name!

When I was only fourteen he was

already famous. Even in Legnago -

the tiniest town in Italy - I knew

of him.

CUT TO:

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

I was still playing childish games

when he was playing music for kings

and emperors. Even the Pope in Rome!

CUT TO:

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

I admit I was jealous when I heard

the tales they told about him. Not

of the brilliant little prodigy

himself, but of his father, who had

taught him everything.

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

My father did not care for music. He

wanted me only to be a merchant,

like himself. As anonymous as he

was. When I told how I wished I could

be like Mozart, he would say, Why?

Do you want to be a trained monkey?

Would you like me to drag you around

Europe doing tricks like a circus

freak? How could I tell him what

music meant to me?

CUT TO:

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

Even then a spray of sounded notes

could make me dizzy, almost to

falling.

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

Whilst my father prayed earnestly to

God to protect commerce, I would

offer up secretly the proudest prayer

a boy could think of. Lord, make me

a great composer! Let me celebrate

your glory through music - and be

celebrated myself! Make me famous

through the world, dear God! Make me

immortal! After I die let people

speak my name forever with love for

what I wrote! In return I vow I will

give you my chastity - my industry,

my deepest humility, every hour of

my life. And I will help my fellow

man all I can. Amen and amen!

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

And do you know what happened? A

miracle!

OLD SALIERI

Suddenly he was dead. Just like that!

And my life changed forever. My mother

said, Go. Study music if you really

want to. Off with you! And off I

went as quick as I could and never

saw Italy again. Of course, I knew

God had arranged it all; that was

obvious. One moment I was a frustrated

boy in an obscure little town. The

next I was here, in Vienna, city of

musicians, sixteen years old and

studying under Gluck! Gluck, Father.

Do you know who he was? The greatest

composer of his time. And he loved

me! That was the wonder. He taught

me everything he knew. And when I

was ready, introduced me personally

to the Emperor! Emperor Joseph - the

musical king!  Within a few years I

was his court composer. Wasn't that

incredible? Imperial Composer to His

Majesty! Actually the man had no ear

at all, but what did it matter? He

adored my music, that was enough.

Night after night I sat right next

to the Emperor of Austria, playing

duets with him, correcting the royal

sight-reading. Tell me, if you had

been me, wouldn't you have thought

God had accepted your vow? And believe

me, I honoured it. I was a model of

virtue. I kept my hands off women,

worked hours every day teaching

students, many of them for free,

sitting on endless committees to

help poor musicians - work and work

and work, that was all my life. And

it was wonderful! Everybody liked

me. I liked myself. I was the most

successful musician in Vienna. And

the happiest. Till he came. Mozart.

CUT TO:

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

One day he came to Vienna to play

some of his music at the residence

of his employer, the Prince-Archbishop

of Salzburg. Eagerly I went there to

seek him out. That night changed my

life.

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

As I went through the salon, I played

a game with myself. This man had

written his first concerto at the

age of four; his first symphony at

seven; a full-scale opera at twelve.

Did it show? Is talent like that

written on the face?

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

Which one of them could he be?

CUT TO:

ARCO

Mozart is not here.

COLLOREDO

Where is he?

ARCO

They're looking for him, Your Grace.

CUT TO:

COLLOREDO

(to Arco)

We'll start without him.

MOZART

Miaouw! Miaouw! Mouse-wouse? It's

Puss-wuss, fangs-wangs. Paws-claws.

Pounce-bounce!

CONSTANZE

Stop it. Stop it!

CONSTANZE

Stop it!

MOZART

I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly.

You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we

are going back.

CONSTANZE

No! No! No!

MOZART

Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you

know where you are?

CONSTANZE

Where?

MOZART

We are in the Residence of the

Fartsbishop of Salzburg.

CONSTANZE

Fartsbishop!

CONSTANZE

Your Grace, I've got something to

tell you. I want to complain about

this man.

MOZART

Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all.

They won't understand you anyway.

CONSTANZE

Why not?

MOZART

Because here everything goes

backwards. People walk backwards,

dance backwards, sing backwards, and

talk backwards.

CONSTANZE

That's stupid.

MOZART

Why? People fart backwards.

CONSTANZE

Do you think that's funny?

MOZART

Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've

been doing it for years.

CONSTANZE

Oh, ha, ha, ha.

MOZART

Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!

CONSTANZE

Yes, you are. You're very sick.

MOZART

No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit.

Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!

CONSTANZE

(working it out)

Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my

Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!

MOZART

Em iram! Em iram!

CONSTANZE

No, I'm not playing this game.

MOZART

No, this is serious. Say it backwards.

CONSTANZE

No!

MOZART

Just say it - you'll see. It's very

serious. Em iram!  Em iram!

CONSTANZE

Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no!

You're a fiend. I'm not going to

marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.

MOZART

Ui-vol-i-tub!

CONSTANZE

Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love

but I love ui - You. I love you!

MOZART

Tish-I'm tee. What's that?

CONSTANZE

What?

MOZART

Tish-I'm-tee.

CONSTANZE

Eat

MOZART

Yes.

CONSTANZE

Eat my - ah!

MOZART

My music! They've started! They've

started without me!

CUT TO:

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

So that was he! That giggling, dirty-

minded creature I'd just seen crawling

on the floor. Mozart. The phenomenon

whose legend had haunted my youth.

Impossible.

ARCO

Follow me, please. The Archbishop

would like a word.

MOZART

Certainly!

MOZART

Well, I think that went off remarkably

well, don't you?

ARCO

Indeed.

MOZART

These Viennese certainly know good

music when they hear it.

ARCO

His Grace is very angry with you.

MOZART

What do you mean?

ARCO

You are to come in here and ask his

pardon.

ARCO

Your Grace.

COLLOREDO

Ah, Mozart. Why?

MOZART

Why what, sir?

COLLOREDO

Why do I have to be humiliated in

front of my guests by one of my own

servants?

MOZART

Humiliated?

COLLOREDO

How much provocation am I to endure

from you? The more license I allow

you, the more you take.

MOZART

If His Grace is not satisfied with

me, he can dismiss me.

COLLOREDO

I wish you to return immediately to

Salzburg. Your father is waiting for

you there patiently. I will speak to

you further when I come.

MOZART

No, Your Grace! I mean with all

humility, no. I would rather you

dismissed me. It's obvious I don't

satisfy.

COLLOREDO

Then try harder, Mozart. I have no

intention of dismissing you. You

will remain in my service and learn

your place. Go now.

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

Extraordinary! On the page it looked

nothing. The beginning simple, almost

comic. Just a pulse - bassoons and

basset horns - like a rusty

squeezebox. Then suddenly - high

above it - an oboe, a single note,

hanging there unwavering, till a

clarinet took over and sweetened it

into a phrase of such delight! This

was no composition by a performing

monkey! This was a music I'd never

heard. Filled with such longing,

such unfulfillable longing, it had

me trembling. It seemed to me that I

was hearing a voice of God.

MOZART

Excuse me!

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

But why?

OLD SALIERI

Why?  Would God choose an obscene

child to be His instrument? It was

not to be believed! This piece had

to be an accident. It had to be!

JOSEPH

How good is he, this Mozart?

VON SWIETEN

He's remarkable, Majesty. I heard an

extraordinary serious opera of his

last month. Idomeneo, King of Crete.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

That? A most tiresome piece. I heard

it, too.

VON SWIETEN

Tiresome?

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

A young man trying to impress beyond

his abilities. Too much spice. Too

many notes.

VON SWIETEN

Majesty, I thought it the most

promising work I've heard in years.

JOSEPH

Ah-ha. Well then, we should make

some effort to acquire him. We could

use a good German composer in Vienna,

surely?

VON STRACK

I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid

it's not possible. The young man is

still in the pay of the Archbishop.

JOSEPH

Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure

he could be tempted with the right

offer. Say, an opera in German for

our National Theatre.

VON SWIETEN

Excellent, sire!

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

But not German, I beg your Majesty!

Italian is the proper language for

opera. All educated people agree on

that.

JOSEPH

Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?

VON STRACK

In my opinion, it is time we had a

piece in our own language, sir. Plain

German. For plain people.

JOSEPH

Ah-ha. Kapellmeister?

BONNO

(Italian accent)

Majesty, I must agree with Herr

Dirretore. Opera is an Italian art,

solamente. German is - scusate - too

bruta for singing, too rough.

JOSEPH

Ah-ha. Court Composer, what do you

say?

SALIERI

I think it is an interesting notion

to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty.

It should really infuriate the

Archbishop beyond measure - if that

is your Majesty's intention.

JOSEPH

You are cattivo, Court Composer.

(briskly, to Von Strack)

I want to meet this young man.

Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant

welcome for him.

VON STRACK

Yes, sir.

JOSEPH

Well. There it is.

SALIERI

Si.

SALIERI

Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl,

good morning.

LORL

Good morning, sir.

SALIERI

What have you got for me today? Let

me see.

SALIERI

Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my

favourites. Give my best thanks to

the baker.

LORL

I will, sir.

SALIERI

Thank you. Are you well today,

Fraulein Lorl?

LORL

Yes, thank you, sir.

SALIERI

Bene! Bene!

SALIERI

Grazie, Signore.

MOZART

And the other one?

MOZART

And the other one?

MOZART

Oh, they're both so beautiful, I

can't decide. Why don't I have two

heads?

JOSEPH

Good, good, good.

JOSEPH

Good morning, gentlemen.

JOSEPH

(to Von Strack)

Well, what do you have for me today?

VON STRACK

Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -

JOSEPH

Yes, what about him?

VON STRACK

He's here.

JOSEPH

Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.

SALIERI

Majesty, I hope you won't think it

improper, but I have written a little

March of Welcome in his honour.

JOSEPH

What a charming idea. May I see?

SALIERI

(handing it over)

It's just a trifle, of course.

JOSEPH

May I try it?

SALIERI

Majesty.

JOSEPH

Delightful, Court Composer. Would

you permit me to play it as he comes

in?

SALIERI

You do me too much honour, Sire.

JOSEPH

Let's have some fun.

(to the waiting

Majordomo)

Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But

slowly, slowly. I need a minute to

practice.

SALIERI

A-flat, Majesty.

JOSEPH

Ah-ha!

MAJORDOMO

Herr Mozart.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Bravo, Your Majesty!

VON STRACK

Well done, Sire!

JOSEPH

Gentlemen, gentlemen, a little less

enthusiasm, I beg you. Ah, Mozart.

MOZART

Your Majesty!

JOSEPH

No, no, please! It is not a holy

relic.

(raising Mozart up)

You know we have met already? In

this very room. Perhaps you won't

remember it, you were only six years

old.

(to the others)

He was giving the most brilliant

little concert here. As he got off

the stool, he slipped and fell. My

sister Antoinette helped him up

herself, and do you know what he

did? Jumped straight into her arms

and said, Will you marry me, yes or

no?

JOSEPH

You know all these gentlemen, I'm

sure.

JOSEPH

The Baron Von Swieten.

VON SWIETEN

I'm a great admirer of yours, young

man. Welcome.

MOZART

Oh, thank you.

JOSEPH

The Director of our Opera. Count

Orsini-Rosenberg.

MOZART

(bowing excitedly)

Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine.

Absolutely.

JOSEPH

And here is our illustrious Court

Composer, Herr Salieri.

SALIERI

(taking his hand)

Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto

straordinario!

MOZART

I know your work well, Signore. Do

you know I actually composed some

variations on a melody of yours?

SALIERI

Really?

MOZART

Mio caro Adone.

SALIERI

Ah!

MOZART

A funny little tune, but it yielded

some good things.

JOSEPH

And now he has returned the

compliment. Herr Salieri composed

that March of Welcome for you.

MOZART

(speaking expertly)

Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono

commosso! E un onore per mo

eccezionale. Compositore brilliante

e famossissimo!

SALIERI

My pleasure.

JOSEPH

Well, there it is. Now to business.

Young man, we are going to commission

an opera from you. What do you say?

MOZART

Majesty!

JOSEPH

(to the courtiers)

Did we vote in the end for German or

Italian?

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Well, actually, Sire, if you remember,

we did finally incline to Italian.

VON STRACK

Did we?

VON SWIETEN

I don't think it was really decided,

Director.

MOZART

Oh, German! German! Please let it be

German.

JOSEPH

Why so?

MOZART

Because I've already found the most

wonderful libretto!

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Oh? Have I seen it?

MOZART

I - I don't think you have, Herr

Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite

n - Of course, I'll show it to you

immediately.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

I think you'd better.

JOSEPH

Well, what is it about? Tell us the

story.

MOZART

It's actually quite amusing, Majesty.

It's set - the  whole thing is set

in a - in a -

JOSEPH

Yes, where?

MOZART

In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A

Seraglio.

JOSEPH

Ah-ha.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

You mean in Turkey?

MOZART

Exactly.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Then why especially does it have to

be in German?

MOZART

Well not especially. It can be in

Turkish, if you really want. I don't

care.

VON SWIETEN

(kindly)

My dear fellow, the language is not

finally the point. Do you really

think that subject is quite

appropriate for a national theatre?

MOZART

Why not? It's charming. I mean, I

don't actually show concubines

exposing their! their! It's not

indecent!

(to Joseph)

It's highly moral, Majesty. It's

full of proper German virtues. I

swear it. Absolutely!

JOSEPH

Well, I'm glad to hear that.

SALIERI

Excuse me, Sire, but what do you

think these could be? Being a

foreigner, I would love to learn.

JOSEPH

Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well,

tell him, Mozart. Name us a German

virtue.

MOZART

Love, Sire!

SALIERI

Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we

know nothing about that.

MOZART

No, I don't think you do. I mean

watching Italian opera, all those

male sopranos screeching. Stupid fat

couples rolling their eyes about!

That's not love - it's just rubbish.

MOZART

Majesty, you choose the language. It

will be my task to set it to the

finest music ever offered a monarch.

JOSEPH

Well, there it is. Let it be German.

JOSEPH

Ah, this is yours.

MOZART

Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is

already here in my head.

JOSEPH

What? On one hearing only?

MOZART

I think so, Sire, yes.

JOSEPH

Show me.

MOZART

(to Salieri)

The rest is just the same, isn't it?

MOZART

That really doesn't work, does it?

MOZART

Did you try this? Wouldn't it be

just a little more -?

MOZART

Or this - yes, this! Better.

SALIERI

Grazie, Signore.

SALIERI

Yes?

LORL

Madame Cavalieri is here for her

lesson, sir.

SALIERI

Bene.

CAVALIERI

(curtseying to him)

Maestro.

SALIERI

Good morning.

CAVALIERI

(posing, in her turban)

Well? How do you like it? It's

Turkish. My hairdresser tells me

everything's going to be Turkish

this year!

SALIERI

Really? What else did he tell you

today? Give me some gossip.

CAVALIERI

Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.

SALIERI

Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.

CAVALIERI

And he's been commissioned to write

an opera. Is it true?

SALIERI

Yes.

CAVALIERI

Is there a part for me?

SALIERI

No.

CAVALIERI

How do you know?

SALIERI

Well even if there is, I don't think

you want to get involved with this

one.

CAVALIERI

Why not?

SALIERI

Well, do you know where it's set, my

dear?

CAVALIERI

Where?

SALIERI

In a harem.

CAVALIERI

What's that?

SALIERI

A brothel.

CAVALIERI

Oh!

SALIERI

A Turkish brothel.

CAVALIERI

Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's

different. I want to be in it.

SALIERI

My dear, it will hardly enhance your

reputation to be celebrated throughout

Vienna as a singing prostitute for a

Turk.

CAVALIERI

Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce

us anyway.

SALIERI

Perhaps.

CAVALIERI

What does he look like?

SALIERI

You might be disappointed.

CAVALIERI

Why?

SALIERI

Looks and talent don't always go

together, Katherina.

CAVALIERI

(airily)

Looks don't concern me, Maestro.

Only talent interests a woman of

taste.

CAVALIERI

Since you are determined, Since you

are determined, Calmly, with no

ferment, Welcome - every pain and

woe. Bind me then - compel me! Bind

me then - compel me! Hurt me. Break

me! Kill me! At last I shall be freed

by death!

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

There she was. I had no idea where

they met - or how - yet there she

stood on stage for all to see. Showing

off like the greedy songbird she

was. Ten minutes of ghastly scales

and arpeggios, whizzing up and down

like fireworks at a fairground.

CAVALIERI

(singing)

Be freed at last by death! Be freed

at last by death! At last I shall be

freed By! Death!

OLD SALIERI

Understand, I was in love with the

girl. Or at least in lust. I wasn't

a saint. It took me the most

tremendous effort to be faithful to

my vow. I swear to you I never laid

a finger on her. All the same, I

couldn't bear to think of anyone

else touching her - least of all the

Creature.

CUT BACK TO:

CAST OF SERAGLIO

(singing)

Pasha Selim May he Live forever!

Ever, ever, ever, ever! Honour to

his regal name! Honour to his regal

name! May his noble brow emblazon

Glory, fortune, joy and fame! Honour

be to Pasha Selim Honour to his regal

name! Honour to his regal name!

JOSEPH

Bravo, Madame. You are an ornament

to our stage.

CAVALIERI

Majesty.

JOSEPH

(to Salieri)

And to you, Court Composer. Your

pupil has done you great credit.

MADAME WEBER

Let us pass, please! Let us pass at

once! We're with the Emperor.

FLUNKY

I am sorry, Madame. It is not

permitted.

MADAME WEBER

Do you know who I am?

(pointing to Constanze)

This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber.

We are favoured guests!

FLUNKY

I am sorry, Madame, but I have my

orders.

MADAME WEBER

Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart

immediately! This is insupportable!

CONSTANZE

Mother, please!

MADAME WEBER

Go ahead, Constanze. Just ignore

this fellow.

(pushing her)

Go ahead, dear!

FLUNKY

(barring the way)

I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot

let anyone pass.

MADAME WEBER

Young man, I am no stranger to

theatres. I'm no stranger to

insolence!

CUT BACK TO:

JOSEPH

Well, Herr Mozart! A good effort.

Decidedly that. An excellent effort!

You've shown us something quite new

today.

MOZART

It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?

JOSEPH

Yes, indeed.

MOZART

And German?

JOSEPH

Oh, yes. Absolutely. German.

Unquestionably!

MOZART

So then you like it? You really like

it, Your Majesty?

JOSEPH

Of course I do. It's very good. Of

course now and then - just now and

then - it gets a touch elaborate.

MOZART

What do you mean, Sire?

JOSEPH

Well, I mean occasionally it seems

to have, how shall one say?

(he stops in

difficulty; to Orsini-

Rosenberg)

How shall one say, Director?

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Too many notes, Your Majesty?

JOSEPH

Exactly. Very well put. Too many

notes.

MOZART

I don't understand. There are just

as many notes, Majesty, as are

required. Neither more nor less.

JOSEPH

My dear fellow, there are in fact

only so many notes the ear can hear

in the course of an evening. I think

I'm right in saying that, aren't I,

Court Composer?

SALIERI

Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes,

Majesty.

MOZART

(to Salieri)

But this is absurd!

JOSEPH

My dear, young man, don't take it

too hard. Your work is ingenious.

It's quality work. And there are

simply too many notes, that's all.

Cut a few and it will be perfect.

MOZART

Which few did you have in mind,

Majesty?

JOSEPH

Well. There it is.

MADAME WEBER

Wolfi! Wolfi, my dear!

MADAME WEBER

Oh!

MOZART

Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She

is my landlady.

JOSEPH

Enchanted, Madame.

MADAME WEBER

Oh, Sire! such an honour! And, and,

and these are my dear daughters.

This is Constanze. She is the fiancee

of Herr Mozart.

JOSEPH

Really? How delightful. May I ask

when you marry?

MOZART

Well - Well we haven't quite received

my father's consent, Your Majesty.

Not entirely. Not altogether.

JOSEPH

Excuse me, but how old are you?

MOZART

Twenty-six.

JOSEPH

Well, my advice is to marry this

charming young lady and stay with us

in Vienna.

MADAME WEBER

You see? You see? I've told him that,

Your Majesty, but he won't listen to

me.

MADAME WEBER

Oh, Your Majesty, you give such

wonderful - such impeccable - such

royal advice. I - I - May I?

JOSEPH

Well. There it is. Strack.

CONSTANZE

(to Mozart)

Get some water!

MOZART

Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm

going to do. I'm going to write

another aria for you. Something even

more amazing for the second act. I

have to get some water. Her mother

is lying on the stage.

CAVALIERI

Don't bother!

MOZART

What?

CAVALIERI

Don't bother.

MOZART

I'll be right back.

CONSTANZE

Are you all right?

MADAME WEBER

Ah, what an evening! What a wise man

we have for an Emperor. Oh, my

children!

(with sudden, hard

briskness)

Now I want you to write your father

exactly what His Majesty said.

MOZART

You should really go home now, Frau

Weber. Your carriage must be waiting.

MADAME WEBER

But aren't you taking us?

MOZART

I have to talk to the singers.

MADAME WEBER

That's all right; we'll wait for

you. Just don't take all night.

CAVALIERI

Did you know? Had you heard?

SALIERI

What?

CAVALIERI

The marriage!

SALIERI

Well, what does it matter to you?

CAVALIERI

Nothing! He can marry who he pleases.

I don't give a damn.

CAVALIERI

How was I? Tell me honestly.

SALIERI

You were sublime.

CAVALIERI

What did you think of the music?

SALIERI

Extremely clever.

CAVALIERI

Meaning you didn't like it.

MOZART

Oh - excuse me!

CAVALIERI

Is her mother still lying on the

floor?

MOZART

No, she's fine.

CAVALIERI

I'm so relieved.

SALIERI

Dear Mozart, my sincere

congratulations.

MOZART

Did you like it, then?

SALIERI

How could I not?

MOZART

It really is the best music one can

hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?

CAVALIERI

Is she a good fuck?

MOZART

What??

CAVALIERI

I assume she's the virtuoso in that

department. There can't be any other

reason you'd marry someone like that.

CAVALIERI

Come in!

CONSTANZE

Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling

very well. Can we leave now?

MOZART

Of course.

CAVALIERI

No, no, no, no. You can't take him

away now. This is his night. Won't

you introduce us, Wolfgang?

MOZART

Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night,

Signore.

CAVALIERI

You really are full of surprises,

aren't you? You are quite

extraordinary, you little shit!

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

At that moment I knew beyond any

doubt. He'd had her. The Creature

had had my darling girl.

OLD SALIERI

It was incomprehensible. What was

God up to? Here I was denying all my

natural lust in order to deserve

God's gift and there was Mozart

indulging his in all directions -

even though engaged to be married! -

and no rebuke at all! Was it possible

I was being tested? Was God expecting

me to offer forgiveness in the face

of every offense, no matter how

painful? That was very possible. All

the same, why him? Why use Mozart to

teach me lessons in humility? My

heart was filling up with such hatred

for that little man. For the first

time in my life I began to know really

violent thoughts. I couldn't stop

them.

VOGLER

Did you try?

OLD SALIERI

Every day. Sometimes for hours I

would pray!

SALIERI

Please! Please! Send him away, back

to Salzburg. For his sake as well as

mine.

CUT BACK TO:

COLLOREDO

No! I won't have him back.

LEOPOLD

But he needs to be here in Salzburg,

Your Grace. He needs me and he needs

you. Your protection, your

understanding.

COLLOREDO

Hardly.

LEOPOLD

Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the

worst mistake of his life. Some little

Viennese slut is trying to trick him

into marriage. I know my son. He is

too simple to see the trap - and

there is no one there who really

cares for him.

COLLOREDO

I'm not surprised. Money seems to be

more important to him than loyalty

or friendship. He has sold himself

to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for

him.

LEOPOLD

Sir -

COLLOREDO

Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled,

conceited brat.

LEOPOLD

Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't

blame him. The fault is mine. I was

too indulgent with him. But not again.

Never again, I promise! I implore

you - let me bring him back here.

I'll make him give his word to serve

you faithfully.

COLLOREDO

And how will you make him keep it?

LEOPOLD

Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in

anything. Please, Your Grace, give

him one more chance.

COLLOREDO

You have leave to try.

LEOPOLD

Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace!

I thank you!

LEOPOLD (V.O.)

My dear son.

LEOPOLD (V.O.)

I write to you with urgent news. I

am coming to Vienna. Take no further

steps toward marriage until we meet.

You are too gullible to see your own

danger. As you honour the father who

has devoted his entire life to yours,

do as I bid, and await my coming.

MOZART

I will.

PRIEST

And will you, Constanze Weber, take

this man, Wolfgang to be your lawful

husband?

CONSTANZE

I will.

PRIEST

I now pronounce you man and wife.

MOZART (V.O.)

Most beloved father, it is done. Do

not blame me that I did not wait to

see your dear face. I knew you would

have tried to dissuade me from my

truest happiness and I could not

have borne it. Your every word is

precious to me. Remember how you

have always told me Vienna is the

City of Musicians. To conquer here

is to conquer Europe! With my wife I

can do it.  I vow I will become

regular in my habits and productive

as never before. She is wonderful,

Papa, and I know that you will love

her. And one day soon when I am a

wealthy man, you will come and live

with us, and we will be so happy. I

long for that day, best of Papas,

and kiss your hand a hundred thousand

times.

JOSEPH

Good morning, Court Composer. This

is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.

SALIERI

Your Highness.

JOSEPH

She has asked me to advise her on a

suitable musical instructor. I think

I've come up with an excellent idea.

SALIERI

Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a

tremendous honour!

JOSEPH

I'm thinking about Herr Mozart.

What is your view?

SALIERI

An interesting idea, Majesty. But -

JOSEPH

Yes?

SALIERI

You already commissioned an opera

from Mozart.

JOSEPH

And the result satisfies.

SALIERI

Yes, of course. My concern is to

protect you from any suspicion of

favouritism.

JOSEPH

Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want

Mozart.

SALIERI

I'm sure there is a way, Majesty.

Some kind of a little contest. I

could perhaps put together a small

Committee, and I could see to it

naturally that it will select

according to Your Majesty's wishes.

JOSEPH

You please me, Court Composer. A

very clever idea.

SALIERI

(bowing)

Sire.

JOSEPH

Well. There it is.

CUT TO:

MOZART

What is this, Herr Chamberlain?

VON STRACK

What is what?

MOZART

Why do I have to submit samples of

my work to some stupid committee?

Just to teach a sixteen-year-old

girl.

VON STRACK

Because His Majesty wishes it.

MOZART

Is the Emperor angry with me?

VON STRACK

On the contrary.

MOZART

Then why doesn't he simply appoint

me to the post?

VON STRACK

Mozart, you are not the only composer

in Vienna.

MOZART

No, but I'm the best.

VON STRACK

A little modesty would suit you

better.

MOZART

Who is on this committee?

VON STRACK

Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini-

Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.

MOZART

Naturally, the Italians! Of course!

Always the Italians!

VON STRACK

Mozart -

MOZART

They hate my music. It terrifies

them. The only sound Italians

understand is banality. Tonic and

dominant, tonic and dominant, from

here to Resurrection!

(singing angrily)

Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything

else is morbid.

VON STRACK

Mozart -

MOZART

Show them one interesting modulation

and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza!

Morbidezza! Italians are musical

idiots and you want them to judge my

music!

VON STRACK

Look, young man, the issue is simple.

If you want this post, you must submit

your stuff in the same way as all

your colleagues.

MOZART

Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you

straight: I will not!

CUT TO:

CONSTANZE

I think you're mad! You're really

mad!

MOZART

Oh, leave me alone.

CONSTANZE

One royal pupil and the whole of

Vienna will come flocking. We'd be

set up for life!

MOZART

They'll come anyway. They love me

here.

CONSTANZE

No, they will not. I know how things

work in this city.

MOZART

Oh yes? You always know everything.

CONSTANZE

Well, I'm not borrowing any more

money from my mother, and that's

that!

MOZART

You borrowed money from your mother?

CONSTANZE

Yes!

MOZART

Well, don't do that again!

CONSTANZE

How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do

you want me to go into the streets

and beg?

MOZART

Don't be stupid.

CONSTANZE

All they want to see is your work.

What's wrong with that?

MOZART

Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need

them.

CONSTANZE

This isn't pride. It's sheer

stupidity!

CUT TO:

SALIERI

Yes.

SERVANT

Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who

insists on talking to you.

SALIERI

Who is she?

SERVANT

She didn't say. But she says it's

urgent.

SALIERI

(to the pupil)

Excuse me, my dear.

CUT TO:

CONSTANZE

Excellency!

SALIERI

Madame. How can I help you?

SALIERI

Frau Mozart?

CONSTANZE

That's right, Your Excellency. I've

come on behalf of my hus band. I'm -

I'm bringing some samples of his

work so he can be considered for the

royal appointment.

SALIERI

How charming.  But why did he not

come himself?

CONSTANZE

He's terribly busy, sir.

SALIERI

I understand.

SALIERI

I will look at them, of course, the

moment I can. It will be an honour.

Please give him my warmest.

CONSTANZE

Would it be too much trouble, sir,

to ask you to look at them now?

While I wait.

SALIERI

I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this

very moment. Just leave them with

me. I assure you they will be quite

safe.

CONSTANZE

I - I really cannot do that, Your

Excellency. You see, he doesn't know

I'm here.

SALIERI

Really?

CONSTANZE

My husband is a proud man, sir. He

would be furious if he knew I'd come.

SALIERI

Then he didn't send you?

CONSTANZE

No, sir. This is my own idea.

SALIERI

I see.

CONSTANZE

Sir, we really need this job. We're

desperate. My husband spends far

more than he can ever earn. I don't

mean he's lazy - he's not at all -

he works all day long. It's just!

he's not practical. Money simply

slips through his fingers, it's really

ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know

you help musicians. You're famous

for it. Give him just this one post.

We'd be forever indebted!

SALIERI

Let me offer you some refreshment.

Do you know what these are?

SALIERI

Cappezzoli di Venere. Nipples of

Venus. Roman chestnuts in brandied

sugar. Won't you try one? They're

quite surprising.

CONSTANZE

Oh! They're wonderful.

CONSTANZE

Thank you very much, Your Excellency.

SALIERI

Don't keep calling me that. It puts

me at such a distance. I was not

born a Court Composer, you know.

I'm from a small town, just like

your husband.

SALIERI

Are you sure you can't leave that

music, and come back again? I have

other things you might like.

CONSTANZE

That's very tempting, but it's

impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would

be frantic if he found those were

missing. You see, they're all

originals.

SALIERI

Originals?

CONSTANZE

Yes.

SALIERI

These are originals?

CONSTANZE

Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

CUT TO:

OLD SALIERI

Astounding! It was actually beyond

belief. These were first and only

drafts of music yet they showed no

corrections of any kind. Not one.

Do you realize what that meant?

OLD SALIERI

He'd simply put down music already

finished in his head. Page after

page of it, as if he was just taking

dictation. And music finished as no

music is ever finished.

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

Displace one note and there would be

diminishment. Displace one phrase,

and the structure would fall. It was

clear to me. That sound I had heard

in the Archbishop's palace had been

no accident. Here again was the very

voice of God! I was staring through

the cage of those meticulous ink-

strokes at an absolute, inimitable

beauty.

CONSTANZE

Is it no good?

SALIERI

It is miraculous.

CONSTANZE

Oh yes. He's really proud of his

work.

CONSTANZE

So, will you help him?

SALIERI

Tomorrow night I dine with the

Emperor. One word from me and the

post is his.

CONSTANZE

Oh, thank you, sir!

SALIERI

Come back tonight.

CONSTANZE

Tonight?

SALIERI

Alone.

CONSTANZE

What for?

SALIERI

Some service deserves service in

return. No?

CONSTANZE

What do you mean?

SALIERI

Isn't it obvious?

SALIERI

It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you

want it for your husband, come

tonight.

CONSTANZE

But! I'm a married woman!

SALIERI

Then don't. It's up to you. Not to

be vague, that is the price.

SALIERI

Yes.

CUT TO:

OLD SALIERI

Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow

of chastity. What did it matter?

Good, patient, hard-working, chaste -

what did it matter? Had goodness

made me a good composer? I realized

it absolutely then - that moment:

goodness is nothing in the furnace

of art. And I was nothing to God.

VOGLER

(crying out)

You cannot say that!

OLD SALIERI

No? Was Mozart a good man?

VOGLER

God's ways are not yours. And you

are not here to question Him. Offer

him the salt of penitence. He will

give you back the bread of eternal

life. He is all merciful. That is

all you need to know.

OLD SALIERI

All I ever wanted was to sing to

Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He

gave me that longing - then made me

mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't

want me to serve Him with music, why

implant the desire, like a lust in

my body, then deny me the talent? Go

on, tell me! Speak for Him!

VOGLER

My son, no one can speak for God.

OLD SALIERI

Oh? I thought you did so every day.

So speak now. Answer me!

VOGLER

I do not claim to unravel the

mysteries. I treasure them. As you

should.

OLD SALIERI

(impatiently)

Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always

the same stale answers!

(intimately to the

priest)

There is no God of Mercy, Father.

Just a God of torture.

CUT TO:

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

Evening came to that room. I sat

there not knowing whether the girl

would return or not. I prayed as I'd

never prayed before.

SALIERI

Dear God, enter me now. Fill me with

one piece of true music. One piece

with your breath in it, so I know

that you love me. Please. Just one.

Show me one sign of your favour, and

I will show mine to Mozart and his

wife. I will get him the royal

position, and if she comes, I'll

receive her with all respect and

send her home in joy. Enter me! Enter

me! Please! Te imploro.

SERVANT

That lady is back, sir.

SALIERI

Show her in. Then go to bed.

CONSTANZE

Well, I'm here. My husband has gone

to a concert. He didn't think I would

enjoy it.

CONSTANZE

I do apologize for this afternoon.

I behaved like a silly girl. Where

shall we go?

SALIERI

What?

CONSTANZE

Should we stay here? It's a charming

room. I love these candlesticks.

Were they here earlier? I didn't

notice them I suppose I was too

nervous.

CONSTANZE

Wolfgang was given some candlesticks

by King George in England, but they

were only wood. Oh, excuse me. Let's

not talk about him. What do you think

of this? It's real lace. Brussels.

CONSTANZE

Well, it's much too good for every

day. I keep saying to Wolfi, don't

be so extravagant. Presents are

lovely, but we can't afford them.

It doesn't do any good. The more I

tell him, the more he spends. Oh,

excuse me! There I go again.

CONSTANZE

Do you still want to look at this?

Or don't we need to bother anymore?

I imagine we don't, really.

SALIERI

Go! Go! Go!

SALIERI

Show this woman out!

CONSTANZE

You shit! You shit! You rotten shit!

CONSTANZE

What are you staring at?

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

From now on, we are enemies, You and

I!

CUT TO:

OLD SALIERI

Because You will not enter me, with

all my need for you; because You

scorn my attempts at virtue; because

You choose for Your instrument a

boastful, lustful, smutty infantile

boy and give me for reward only the

ability to recognize the Incarnation;

because You are unjust, unfair,

unkind, I will block You! I swear

it! I will hinder and harm Your

creature on earth as far as I am

able. I will ruin Your Incarnation.

CUT BACK TO:

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

What use after all is Man, if not to

teach God His lessons?

CUT TO:

MOZART

Stanzi! Stanzi! Stanzi-Manzi!

MOZART

Sssh!

SCHIKANEDER

(imitating Mozart)

Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!

MOZART

Sssh! Stay here.

SCHIKANEDER

(to the girls, very

tipsy)

Sssh! You're dishgrashful!

MOZART

(playfully)

Stanzi? How's my mouse? Mouse-wouse?

I'm back - puss-wuss is back!

MOZART

Stanzi!

MOZART

What's the matter? What is it?

Stanzi!

MOZART

Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought

some friends to meet you. They're

next door waiting. Do we have anything

to eat? They're all starving.

CONSTANZE

Tell them to go away. I don't want

to see anybody.

MOZART

What's the matter with you?

CONSTANZE

Tell them to go!

MOZART

Sssh. What is it? Tell me.

CONSTANZE

No!

MOZART

Yes!

CONSTANZE

I love you! I love you!

CONSTANZE

I love you. Please stay with me. I'm

frightened.

JOSEPH

I don't think you understand me,

Court Composer.

SALIERI

Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a

most agonizing. decision. But finally,

I simply could not recommend Herr

Mozart.

JOSEPH

Why not?

SALIERI

Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in

a routine way. I was curious to know

why he had so few pupils. It is rather

alarming.

JOSEPH

Oh?

SALIERI

Majesty, I don't like to talk against

a fellow musician.

JOSEPH

Of course not.

SALIERI

I have to tell you, Mozart is not

entirely to be trusted alone with

young ladies.

JOSEPH

Really?

SALIERI

As a matter of fact, one of my own

pupils - a very young singer - told

me she was - er - well!

JOSEPH

Yes?

SALIERI

Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the

course of the same lesson.

JOSEPH

Ah-ha. Well. There it is.

SERVANT

Sir, there is a Herr Mozart waiting

for you in the salon.

SALIERI

What does he want?

SERVANT

He didn't say, sir. I told him I

didn't know when you would be back,

but he insisted on waiting.

SALIERI

Come with me. And stay in the room.

SALIERI

Herr Mozart, what brings you here?

MOZART

Your Excellency, you requested some

specimens of my work. Here they are.

I don't have to tell you how much I

need your help. I truly appreciate

your looking at these. I have

pressures on me - financial pressures.

As you know, I'm a married man now.

SALIERI

So you are. How is your pretty wife?

MOZART

She is well. She is - well, actually,

I'm about to become a father! She

only told me last night. You are the

first to know.

SALIERI

I'm flattered. And congratulations

to you, of course.

MOZART

So you see, this post is very

important to me right now.

SALIERI

Why didn't you come to me yesterday,

Mozart? This is a most painful

situation. Yesterday I could have

helped you. Today, I can't.

MOZART

Why? Here is the music. It's here.

I am submitting it humbly. Isn't

that what you wanted?

SALIERI

I have just come from the palace.

The post has been filled.

MOZART

Filled? That's impossible! They

haven't even seen my work. I need

this post. Please, can't you help

me? Please!

SALIERI

My dear Mozart, there is no one in

the world I would rather help, but

now it is too late.

MOZART

Whom did they choose?

SALIERI

Herr Sommer.

MOZART

Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a

fool! He's a total mediocrity.

SALIERI

No, no, no: he has yet to achieve

mediocrity.

MOZART

But I can't lose this post, I simply

can't! Excellency, please. Let's go

to the palace, and you can explain

to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is

an awful choice. He could actually

do musical harm to the Princess!

SALIERI

An implausible idea. Between you and

me, no one in the world could do

musical harm to the Princess

Elizabeth.

MOZART

Look, I must have pupils. Without

pupils I can't manage.

SALIERI

You don't mean to tell me you are

living in poverty?

MOZART

No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke.

I don't know why.

SALIERI

It has been said, my friend, that

you are inclined to live somewhat

above your means.

MOZART

How can anyone say that? We have no

cook, no maid. We have no footman.

Nothing at all!

SALIERI

How is that possible? You give

concerts, don't you? I hear they are

quite successful.

MOZART

They're stupendously successful.

You can't get a seat. The only problem

is none will hire me. They all want

to hear me play, but they won't let

me teach their daughters. As if I

was some kind of fiend. I'm not a

fiend!

SALIERI

Of course not.

MOZART

Do you have a daughter?

SALIERI

I'm afraid not.

MOZART

Well, could you lend me some money

till you have one? Then I'll teach

her for free. That's a promise. Oh,

I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's

right - I should put a padlock on my

mouth. Seriously, is there any chance

you could manage a loan? Only for

six months, eight at most. After

that I'll be the richest man in

Vienna. I'll pay you back double.

Anything. Name your terms. I'm not

joking. I'm working on something

that's going to explode like a bomb

all over Europe!

SALIERI

Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.

MOZART

I'd better not. It's a bit of a

secret.

SALIERI

Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested.

Truly.

MOZART

Actually, it's a big secret. Oh,

this is delicious! What is it?

SALIERI

Cream cheese mixed with granulated

sugar and suffused with rum. Crema

al Mascarpone.

MOZART

Ah. Italian?

SALIERI

Forgive me. We all have patriotic

feelings of some kind.

MOZART

Two thousand, two hundred florins is

all I need A hundred? Fifty?

SALIERI

What exactly are you working on?

MOZART

I can't say. Really

SALIERI

I don't think you should become known

in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.

However, I know a very distinguished

gentleman I could recommend to you.

And he has a daughter. Will that do?

SCHLUMBERG

Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there,

damn you.

(to Mozart)

Welcome to you. Pay no attention,

they're impossible. Stop it, you

willful things! Come this way. Just

ignore them. They're perfectly

harmless, just willful. I treat them

just like my own children.

MOZART

And which one of them do you want me

to teach?

SCHLUMBERG

What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like

it. Which one, eh? You're a funny

fellow.

(shouting)

Hannah! Come this way.

SCHLUMBERG

Hannah!

SCHLUMBERG

(to Mozart)

You won't be teaching this one either.

She's my wife.

MOZART

(bowing)

Madame.

SCHLUMBERG

This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The

young man Herr Salieri recommended

to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?

FRAU SCHLUMBERG

Upstairs.

SCHLUMBERG

Gertrude!

FRAU SCHLUMBERG

You can't be Herr Mozart!

MOZART

I'm afraid I am.

SCHLUMBERG

Of course, it's him. Who do you think

it is?

FRAU SCHLUMBERG

I've heard about you for ages! I

thought you must be an old man.

SCHLUMBERG

Gertrude!

FRAU SCHLUMBERG

It's such an honour for us to have

you here, Herr Mozart. And for

Gertrude.

SCHLUMBERG

People who know say the girl's got

talent. You must judge for yourself.

If you think she stinks, say so.

FRAU SCHLUMBERG

Michael, please! I'm sure you will

find her most willing, Herr Mozart.

She's really very excited. She's

been preparing all morning.

MOZART

Really?

FRAU SCHLUMBERG

Ah, now! Here she comes.

MOZART

Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.

SCHLUMBERG

Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say

good morning.

FRAU SCHLUMBERG

(to Mozart)

Perhaps a little refreshment first?

A little coffee, or a little

chocolate?

MOZART

I'd like a little wine, if you have

it.

FRAU SCHLUMBERG

Wine?

SCHLUMBERG

Quite right. He's going to need it.

(calling and clapping

his hands)

Klaus! A bottle of wine. Prestissimo!

Now let's go to it. I've been waiting

all day for this.

SCHLUMBERG

(To the dogs)

Now sit down all of you and behave.

Zeman, Mandi, absolutely quiet!

(to a young beagle)

Especially you, Dudelsachs - not one

sound from you.

SCHLUMBERG

Come on, then. Up and at it!

MOZART

Now, please play me something. Just

to give me an idea. Anything will

do.

GERTRUDE

(to parents)

I don't want you to stay.

FRAU SCHLUMBERG

That's all right, dear. Just go ahead,

as if we weren't here.

GERTRUDE

But you are here.

SCHLUMBERG

Never mind, Strudel. It's part of

music, getting used to an audience.

Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?

MOZART

Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.

(to Gertrude)

How long have you been playing,

Fraulein?

FRAU SCHLUMBERG

Just one year.

MOZART

Who was your teacher?

FRAU SCHLUMBERG

I was. But she quite outgrew the

little I could show her.

MOZART

Thank you, Madame.

(to Gertrude)

Come on now - courage. Play me

something you know.

MOZART

Perhaps it would be better if we

were left alone. I think we're both

a little shy.

SCHLUMBERG

Nonsense. Strudel's not shy. She's

just willful! You give into her now,

you'll be sorry later. Strudel -

play.

SCHLUMBERG

I said play!

FRAU SCHLUMBERG

Michael!

MOZART

Perhaps if I were to play a little

first, it might encourage the

Fraulein.

(to the girl)

Why don't you let me try the

instrument? All right?

SCHLUMBERG

Stop that, Dudelsachs! Stop it at

once!

(to Mozart)

Don't let him disturb you. He'll be

all right. He's just a little willful

too. Please, please - play. I beg

you.

SCHLUMBERG

Stop it! STOP!

SCHLUMBERG

No, not you. I was talking to the

dog. You keep playing. It's most

important. He always howls when he

hears music. We've got to break them

of the habit. Play, please. Please!

SCHLUMBERG

That's it. Now keep going, just keep

going.

(to the beagle)

Now you stop that noise, Dudelsachs,

you stop it this instant! This

instant, do you hear me? Keep going,

Herr Mozart, that's it. Go on, go

on!

SCHLUMBERG

Good, good, good! Very good dog!

Very, very good Dudelsachs.

(to his wife, snapping

his fingers)

Quick, quick, dear, bring his biscuit.

SCHLUMBERG

Now guess who's going to get a nice

reward? Clever, clever Dudi.

SCHLUMBERG

It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!

MOZART

(barely controlling

himself)

Well, I'm a good teacher. The next

time you wish me to instruct another

of your dogs, please let me know.

Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame!

goodbye, Sir!

FRAU SCHLUMBERG

What a strange young man.

SCHLUMBERG

Yes. He is a little strange.

MOZART

Papa! PAPA!

MOZART

Why are you here?

LEOPOLD

Am I not welcome?

MOZART

Of course, welcome! Welcome ten

thousand times. Papa! my Papa!

LEOPOLD

You're very thin. Does she not feed

you, this wife of yours?

MOZART

Feed? Well, of course she feeds me.

She stuffs me like a goose all day

long. She's the best cook in the

world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait,

you'll see.

LEOPOLD

Is she not here?

MOZART

I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!

LEOPOLD

Do you always live like this?

MOZART

Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly

like this. I mean today - just today,

Stanzi - I remember now. She had to

go - yes! She had to help her mother.

Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a

very sweet woman, you'll see.

MOZART

Oh! I didn't know you were home.

Stanzi, this is my father.

MOZART

We'll wait, we'll wait. Why don't

you get up now, darling?

MOZART

She's very tired, poor creature.

You know me: I'm a real pig. It's

not so easy cleaning up after me.

LEOPOLD

Don't you have a maid?

MOZART

Oh we could, if we wanted to, but

Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants

to do everything herself.

LEOPOLD

How is your financial situation?

MOZART

It couldn't be better.

LEOPOLD

That's not what I hear.

MOZART

What do you mean? It's wonderful.

Really, it's - it's marvelous! People

love me here.

LEOPOLD

They say you're in debt.

MOZART

Who? Who says that? Now that's a

malicious lie!

LEOPOLD

How many pupils do you have?

MOZART

Pupils?

LEOPOLD

Yes.

MOZART

Yes.

LEOPOLD

How many?

MOZART

I don't know. It's not important. I

mean, I don't want pupils. They get

in the way. I've got to have time

for composition.

LEOPOLD

Composition doesn't pay. You know

that.

MOZART

This one will.

LEOPOLD

What's that?

MOZART

Oh, let's not talk about it.

LEOPOLD

Why not?

MOZART

It's a secret.

LEOPOLD

You don't have secrets from me.

MOZART

It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're

going to love it. Ah, there she is!

MOZART

My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she

beautiful? Come on now, confess,

Papa. Could you want a prettier girl

for a daughter?

CONSTANZE

Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful.

Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.

MOZART

He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.

LEOPOLD

I see that you're expecting.

CONSTANZE

Oh, yes.

LEOPOLD

When, may I ask?

CONSTANZE

In three months! Papa.

MOZART

Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.

LEOPOLD

Why didn't you mention it in your

letters?

MOZART

Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure

I did.

CONSTANZE

May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?

MOZART

Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out!

This calls for a feast. You don't

want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing.

Papa loves parties, don't you?

CONSTANZE

Wolfi!

MOZART

What? How can you be so boring?

Tea!

CONSTANZE

Wolfi, I think your father's tired.

I'll cook us something here.

LEOPOLD

Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't

spend any money on me.

MOZART

Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better

way could I spend it than on you? My

kissable, missable, suddenly visible

Papa!

CUT STRAIGHT TO:

CUT TO:

SCHIKANEDER

No, no! You both lost. You both lost.

You both have to forfeit. And the

penalty is you must exchange your

wigs.

LEOPOLD

No, please! This is ridiculous! No,

please!

LEOPOLD

No, really!

MOZART

(calling to him)

This is just a game, Papa.

CONSTANZE

This is just a game, Papa!

BYSTANDERS

This is just a game, Papa!

MOZART

Oh no, Papa, please! Don't spoil the

fun. Come on. Here, take mine.

SCHIKANEDER

Herr Mozart, why don't you name your

son's penalty?

MOZART

Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do

anything you say!

LEOPOLD

I want you to come back with me to

Salzburg, my son.

SCHIKANEDER

What did he say? What did he say?

MOZART

Papa, the rule is you can only give

penalties that can be performed in

the room.

LEOPOLD

I'm tired of this game. Please play

without me.

MOZART

But my penalty. I've got to have a

penalty.

SCHIKANEDER

I've got a good one. I've got the

perfect one for you. Come over here.

SCHIKANEDER

Now, I want you to play our tune -

sitting backwards.

MOZART

Oh, that's really too easy. Any child

can do that.

SCHIKANEDER

And a fugue in the manner of Sebastian

Bach.

GUESTS

Another! Do another! Someone else.

MOZART

Give me a name. Who shall I do?

Give me a name.

GUESTS

Gluck! Haydn! Frederic Handel!

CONSTANZE

Salieri! Do Salieri!

MOZART

Now that's hard. That's very hard.

For Salieri one has to face the right

way around.

OLD SALIERI

Go on. Mock me. Laugh, laugh!

CUT BACK TO:

CUT TO:

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

That was not Mozart laughing, Father.

That was God. That was God! God

laughing at me through that obscene

giggle. Go on, Signore. Laugh. Rub

my nose in it. Show my mediocrity

for all to see. You wait! I will

laugh at You! Before I leave this

earth, I will laugh at You! Amen!

CONSTANZE

(outside the door)

Wolfi! Wolfgang!

MOZART

What is it?

CONSTANZE

There's a young girl to see you.

MOZART

What does she want?

CONSTANZE

I don't know.

MOZART

Well, ask her!

CONSTANZE

She won't talk to me. She says she

has to speak to you.

MOZART

Oh, damn!

MOZART

Yes?

LORL

Are you Herr Mozart?

MOZART

That's right.

LORL

My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a

maidservant. I was asked to come

here and offer my services to you.

MOZART

What?

LORL

They'll be paid for by a great admirer

or yours who wishes to remain anon -

anonymous.

CONSTANZE

What do you mean? What admirer?

LORL

I can't tell you that, ma'am.

MOZART

Are you saying that someone is paying

you to be our maid and doesn't want

us to know who he is?

LORL

Yes. I can live in or out just as

you wish.

MOZART

Papa, is this your idea?

LEOPOLD

Mine?

MOZART

Are you playing a trick on me?

LEOPOLD

I never saw this girl in my life.

(to Lorl)

Is this a kind of joke?

LORL

Not at all, sir. And I was told to

wait for an answer.

LEOPOLD

Young woman, this won't do at all.

My son can't possibly accept such an

offer, no matter how generous, unless

he knows who is behind it.

LORL

But I really can't tell you, sir.

LEOPOLD

Oh, this is ridiculous.

CONSTANZE

What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many

admirers in Vienna. They love him

here. People send us gifts all the

time.

LEOPOLD

But you can't take her without

reference. It's unheard of!

CONSTANZE

Well, this is none of your business.

(to Lorl)

Whoever sent you is going to pay,

no?

LORL

That's right, ma'am.

LEOPOLD

So now we are going to let a perfect

stranger into the house?

CONSTANZE

Who is we? Who is letting who?

(to Lorl)

Could you please wait outside?

LORL

Yes, ma'am.

CONSTANZE

Look, old man, you stay out of this.

We spend a fortune on you, more than

we can possibly afford, and all you

do is criticize, morning to night.

And then you think you can -

MOZART

Stanzi!

CONSTANZE

No, it's right he should hear. I'm

sick to death of it. We can't do

anything right for you, can we?

LEOPOLD

Never mind. You won't have to do

anything for me ever again. I'm

leaving!

MOZART

Papa!

LEOPOLD

Don't worry, I'm not staying here to

be a burden.

MOZART

No one calls you that.

LEOPOLD

She does. She says I sleep all day.

CONSTANZE

And so you do! The only time you

come out is to eat.

LEOPOLD

And what do you expect? Who wants to

walk out into a mess like this every

day?

CONSTANZE

Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!

LEOPOLD

So you are! The place is a pigsty

all the time.

CONSTANZE

(to Mozart)

Do you hear him? Do you?

CONSTANZE

(to Lorl)

When can you start?

LORL

Right away, ma'am.

CONSTANZE

Good! Come in. You'll start with

that room there.

(indicating Leopold's

room)

It's filthy!

LEOPOLD

Sorry, sorry! I'm sorry I spoke!

I'm just a provincial from Salzburg.

What do I know about smart Vienna?

Parties all night, every night.

Dancing and drinking like idiot

children!

LEOPOLD (O.S.)

Dinner at eight! Dinner at ten! Dinner

when anyone feels like it! If anyone

feels like it!

LORL

They're out every night, sir. Till

all hours.

LORL

(taking one)

Oh, thank you, sir.

SALIERI

Do any pupils come to the house?

LORL

Not that I've seen.

SALIERI

Then how does he pay for all this?

Does he work at all?

LORL

Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never

leaves the house until evening. He

just sits there, writing and writing.

He doesn't even eat.

SALIERI

Really? What is it he's writing?

LORL

Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.

SALIERI

Of course not. You're a good girl.

You're very kind to do this. Next

time you're sure they'll be out of

the house, let me know, will you?

LORL

Oh, thank you, sir!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LORL

I think I've found out about the

money, sir.

SALIERI

Yes what?

LORL

He kept seven snuff boxes in here.

I could swear they were all gold.

And now look there's only one left.

And inside, sir, look - I counted

them - tickets from the pawnshop.

Six of them.

SALIERI

Where does he work?

LORL

In there, sir.

CUT TO:

JOSEPH

Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes,

indeed. Clever man.

MOZART

Thank you, Sire!

VON SWIETEN

Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.

MOZART

Baron!

MOZART

Majesty, may I ask you to do me the

greatest favour?

JOSEPH

What is it?

MOZART

May I introduce my father? He is on

a short visit here and returning

very soon to Salzburg. He would so

much like to kiss your hand. It would

make his whole stay so memorable for

him.

JOSEPH

Ah! By all means.

LEOPOLD

Your Majesty.

JOSEPH

Good evening.

(to Leopold)

We have met before, Herr Mozart.

LEOPOLD

That's right, Your Majesty. Twenty

years ago. No, twenty-two! twenty-

three! And I remember word for word

what you said to me. You said - you

said --

JOSEPH

Bravo?

LEOPOLD

No! Yes, 'bravo,' of course 'bravo'!

Everybody always says 'bravo' when

Wolfi plays. Like the King of England.

When we played for the King of

England, he got up at the end and

said, 'Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!' three

times. Three bravo's. And the Pope

four! Four bravo's from the Holy

Father, and one 'bellissimo.'

MOZART

Father -

LEOPOLD

Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty.

Your Majesty, I wish to express only

one thing - that you who are the

Father of us all, could teach our

children the gratitude they owe to

fathers. It is not for nothing that

the Fifth Commandment tells us:

'Honour your Father and Mother, that

your days may be long upon the earth.'

JOSEPH

Ah-ha. Well. There it is.

CUT TO:

SALIERI

I've just learned something that

might be of interest to you, Herr

Director.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Yes?

SALIERI

Mozart is writing a new opera. An

Italian opera.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Italian?

BONNO

Aie!

SALIERI

And that's not all. He has chosen

for his subject, Figaro. The Marriage

of Figaro.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

You mean that play?

SALIERI

Exactly.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

He's setting that play to music?

SALIERI

Yes.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

You must be mad.

BONNO

What is this Marriage of Figaro?

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

It's a French play, Kapellmeister.

It has been banned by the Emperor.

BONNO

Hah!

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Are you absolutely sure?

SALIERI

I've seen the manuscript.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Where?

SALIERI

Never mind.

CUT TO:

VON STRACK

I know we banned this play, but

frankly I can't remember why. Can

you refresh my memory, Herr Director?

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain,

that it was banned in France.

VON STRACK

Oh yes, yes. And that was?

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Well, the play makes a hero out of a

valet. He outwits his noble master

and exposes him as a lecher. Do you

see the implications? This would be,

in a grander situation, as if a

Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.

VON STRACK

Ah.

CUT TO:

LACKEY

Herr Mozart.

JOSEPH

Sit down, gentlemen, please.

JOSEPH

Mozart, are you aware I have declared

the French play of Figaro unsuitable

for our theatre?

MOZART

Yes, Sire.

JOSEPH

Yet we hear you are making an opera

from it. Is this true?

MOZART

Who told you this, Majesty?

JOSEPH

It is not your place to ask questions.

Is it true?

MOZART

Well, yes, I admit it is.

JOSEPH

Would you tell me why?

MOZART

Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

What you think, Mozart, is scarcely

the point. It is what His Majesty

thinks that counts.

MOZART

But, Your Majesty -

JOSEPH

(motioning him to be

silent)

Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do

not censor things lightly. When I

do, I have good reason. Figaro is a

bad play. It stirs up hatred between

the classes. In France it has caused

nothing but bitterness. My own dear

sister Antoinette writes me that she

is beginning to be frightened of her

own people. I do not wish to see the

same fears starting here.

MOZART

Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's

nothing like that in the story. I

have taken out everything that could

give offense. I hate politics.

JOSEPH

I think you are rather innocent, my

friend. In these dangerous times I

cannot afford to provoke our nobles

or our people simply over a theatre

piece.

MOZART

But, Majesty, this is just a frolic.

It's a piece about love.

JOSEPH

Ah, love again.

MOZART

But it's new, it's entirely new.

It's so new, people will go mad for

it. For example, I have a scene in

the second act - it starts as a duet,

just a man and wife quarreling.

Suddenly the wife's scheming little

maid comes in unexpectedly - a very

funny situation. Duet turns into

trio. Then the husband's equally

screaming valet comes in. Trio turns

into quartet. Then a stupid old

gardener - quartet becomes quintet,

and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet,

octet! How long do you think I can

sustain that?

JOSEPH

I have no idea.

MOZART

Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the

longest time such a thing could last,

then double it.

JOSEPH

Well, six or seven minutes! maybe

eight!

MOZART

Twenty, sire! How about twenty?

Twenty minutes of continuous music.

No recitatives.

VON SWIETEN

Mozart -

MOZART

(ignoring him)

Sire, only opera can do this. In a

play, if more than one person speaks

at the same time, it's just noise.

No one can understand a word. But

with music, with music you can have

twenty individuals all talking at

once, and it's not noise - it's a

perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?

VON SWIETEN

Mozart, music is not the issue here.

No one doubts your talent. It is

your judgment of literature that's

in question. Even with the politics

taken out, this thing would still

remain a vulgar farce. Why waste

your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely

you can choose more elevated themes?

MOZART

Elevated? What does that mean?

Elevated! The only thing a man should

elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the

teeth with elevated things! Old dead

legends! How can we go on forever

writing about gods and legends?

VON SWIETEN

(aroused)

Because they do. They go on forever -

at least what they represent. The

eternal in us, not the ephemeral.

Opera is here to ennoble us. You and

me, just as much as His Majesty.

BONNO

Bello! Bello, Barone. Veramente.

MOZART

Oh, bello, bello, bello! Come on

now, be honest. Wouldn't you all

rather listen to your hairdressers

than Hercules? Or Horatius? Or

Orpheus? All those old bores! people

so lofty they sound as if they shit

marble!

VON SWIETEN

What?

VON STRACK

Govern your tongue, sir! How dare

you?

MOZART

Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar

man. But I assure you, my music is

not.

JOSEPH

You are passionate, Mozart! But you

do not persuade.

MOZART

Sire, the whole opera is finished.

Do you know how much work went into

it?

BONNO

His Majesty has been more than

patient, Signore.

MOZART

How can I persuade you if you won't

let me show it?

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

That will do, Herr Mozart!

MOZART

Just let me tell you how it begins.

VON STRACK

Herr Mozart -

MOZART

May I just do that, Majesty? Show

you how it begins? Just that?

JOSEPH

Please.

MOZART

Look! There's a servant, down on his

knees. Do you know why? Not from any

oppression. No, he's simply measuring

a space. Do you know what for? His

bed. His wedding bed to see if it

will fit.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.

SALIERI

Incredible.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

The Emperor has given him permission.

BONNO

Si, si! Veramente.

SALIERI

Well, gentlemen, so be it. In that

case I think we should help Mozart

all we can and do our best to protect

him against the Emperor's anger.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

What anger?

SALIERI

About the ballet.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Ballet? What ballet?

SALIERI

Excuse me - didn't His Majesty

specifically forbid ballet in his

opera?

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet

in Figaro?

SALIERI

Yes, in the third act.

CUT TO:

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a

word with you please. Right away.

MOZART

Certainly, Herr Director.

MOZART

Five minutes, please!

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Did you not know that His Majesty

has expressly forbidden ballet in

his operas?

MOZART

Yes, but this is not a ballet. This

is a dance at Figaro's wedding.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Exactly. A dance.

MOZART

But surely the Emperor didn't mean

to prohibit dancing when it's part

of the story.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

It is dangerous for you to interpret

His Majesty's edicts. Give me your

score, please.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Thank you.

MOZART

What are you doing?

MOZART

What are you doing, Herr Director?

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Taking out what you should never

have put in.

CUT TO:

SERVANT

Herr Mozart.

MOZART

Please! Please. I've no one else to

turn to. Please!

SALIERI

Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per

favore. What's the matter?

MOZART

It's unbelievable! The Director has

actually ripped out a huge section

of my music. Pages of it.

SALIERI

Really? Why?

MOZART

I don't know. They say I've got to

re-write the opera, but it's perfect

as it is. I can't rewrite what's

perfect. Can't you talk to him?

SALIERI

Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg?

He's obviously no friend of yours.

MOZART

Oh, I could kill him! I mean really

kill him. I actually threw the entire

opera on the fire, he made me so

angry!

SALIERI

You burned the score?

MOZART

Oh no! My wife took it out in time.

SALIERI

How fortunate.

MOZART

It's not fair that a man like that

has power over our work.

SALIERI

But there are those who have power

over him. I think I'll take this up

with the Emperor.

MOZART

Oh, Excellency, would you?

SALIERI

With all my heart, Mozart.

MOZART

Thank you! Oh, thank you.

SALIERI

(withdrawing it;

imitating the Emperor)

No, no, no, Herr Mozart, please.

It's not a holy relic.

OLD SALIERI

I'm sure I don't need to tell you I

said nothing whatever to the Emperor.

I went to the theatre ready to tell

Mozart that His Majesty had flown

into a rage when I mentioned the

ballet, when suddenly, to my

astonishment, in the middle of the

third act, the Emperor - who never

attended rehearsals - suddenly

appeared.

JOSEPH

What is this? I don't understand.

Is it modern?

BONNO

Majesty, the Herr Director, he has

removed a balleto that would have

occurred at this place.

JOSEPH

Why?

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

It is your regulation, Sire. No ballet

in your opera.

JOSEPH

Do you like this, Salieri?

SALIERI

It is not a question of liking, Your

Majesty. Your own law decrees it,

I'm afraid.

JOSEPH

Well, look at them.

JOSEPH

No, no, no! This is nonsense. Let me

hear the scene with the music.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

But, Sire -

JOSEPH

Oblige me.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Yes, Majesty.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Can we see the scene with the music

back, please?

MOZART

Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr

Director!

MOZART

Ladies and gentlemen, we're going

from where we stopped. The Count:

Anches so. Right away, please!

JOSEPH

(to Orsini-Rosenberg)

What I hoped by that edict, Director,

was simply to prevent hours of dancing

like in French opera. There it is

endless, as you know.

ORSINI-ROSENBERG

Quite so, Majesty.

CUT TO:

OLD SALIERI

(to Vogler)

So Figaro was produced in spite of

me. And in spite of me, a wonder was

revealed. One of the true wonders of

art. The restored third act was bold

and brilliant. The fourth was a

miracle.

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

I saw a woman disguised in her maid's

clothes hear her husband speak the

first tender words he has offered

her in years, only because he thinks

she is someone else. I heard the

music of true forgiveness filling

the theatre, conferring on all who

sat there a perfect absolution. God

was singing through this little man

to all the world - unstoppable -

making my defeat more bitter with

each passing bar.

OLD SALIERI

And then suddenly - a miracle!

CUT BACK TO:

CUT BACK TO:

OLD SALIERI

Father, did you know what that meant?

With that yawn I saw my defeat turn

into a victory. And Mozart was lucky

the Emperor only yawned once. Three

yawns and the opera would fail the

same night; two yawns, within a week

at most. With one yawn the composer

could still get -

CUT TO:

MOZART

Nine performances! Nine! That's all

it's had - and withdrawn.

SALIERI

I know; it's outrageous. Still, if

the public doesn't like one's work

one has to accept the fact gracefully.

MOZART

But what is it they don't like?

SALIERI

Well, I can speak for the Emperor.

You made too many demands on the

royal ear. The poor man can't

concentrate for more than an hour

and you gave him four.

MOZART

What did you think of it yourself?

Did you like it at all?

SALIERI

I think it's marvelous. Truly.

MOZART

It's the best opera yet written. I

know it! Why didn't they come?

SALIERI

I think you overestimate our dear

Viennese, my friend. Do you know you

didn't even give them a good bang at

the end of songs so they knew when

to clap?

MOZART

I know, I know. Perhaps you should

give me some lessons in that.

SALIERI

(fuming)

I wouldn't presume. All the same, if

it wouldn't be imposing, I would

like you to see my new piece. It

would be a tremendous honour for me.

MOZART

Oh no, the honour would be all mine.

SALIERI

(bowing)

Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!

MOZART

Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!

CUT TO:

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

What was this? I never saw him excited

before by any music but his own.

Could he mean it?

OLD SALIERI

(to Vogler)

Would he actually tell me my music

had moved him? Was I really going to

hear that from his own lips? I found

myself actually hurrying the tempo

of the finale.

CUT BACK TO:

MOZART

(to Schikaneder)

Well?

SCHIKANEDER

(mock moved)

Sublime! Utterly sublime!

MOZART

That kind of music should be

punishable by death.

CUT TO:

JOSEPH

I believe that is the best opera yet

written, my friends. Salieri, you

are the brightest star in the musical

firmament. You do honour to Vienna

and to me.

SALIERI

Mozart. It was good of you to come.

MOZART

How could I not?

SALIERI

Did my work please you?

MOZART

How could it not, Excellency?

SALIERI

Yes?

MOZART

I never knew that music like that

was possible.

SALIERI

You flatter me.

MOZART

Oh no! One hears such sounds and

what can one say, but - Salieri!

CUT TO:

MOZART

Oh. Everybody's here! We've got

guests. Good. I've brought some more.

MOZART

We'll have a little party. Come in.

Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?

(to a girl)

This is! a very nice girl.

CONSTANZE

(standing up)

Wolfi.

MOZART

Yes, my love?

CONSTANZE

These gentlemen are from Salzburg.

MOZART

Salzburg.  We were just talking about

Salzburg.

(to the two men,

jubilantly)

If you've come from my friend the

Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just

the right moment. Because I've got

good news for him. I'm done with

Vienna. It's over, finished, done

with! Done with! Done with!

CONSTANZE

Wolfi! Your father is dead.

MOZART

What?

CONSTANZE

Your father is dead.

THE COMMENDATORE

(singing)

Don Giovanni!

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

So rose the dreadful ghost in his

next and blackest opera. There on

the stage stood the figure of a dead

commander calling out 'Repent!

Repent!'

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

And I knew - only I understood -

that the horrifying apparition was

Leopold, raised from the dead.

Wolfgang had actually summoned up

his own father to accuse his son

before all the world. It was

terrifying and wonderful to watch.

OLD SALIERI

Now a madness began in me. The madness

of a man splitting in half. Through

my influence I saw to it Don Giovanni

was played only five times in Vienna.

But in secret I went to every one of

those five - all alone - unable to

help myself, worshipping sound I

alone seemed to hear.

OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

And hour after hour, as I stood there,

understanding even more clearly how

that bitter old man was still

possessing his poor son from beyond

the grave, I began to see a way - a

terrible way - I could finally triumph

over God, my torturer.

(indicating his baby

He liked the monkey, didn't you?

SCHIKANEDER

Yes, well, it's all good fun.

MOZART

I liked the horse.

SCHIKANEDER

Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a

bundle, that horse, but he's worth

it. I tell you, if you'd played Don

Giovanni here it would have been a

great success. I'm not joking. These

people aren't fools. You could do

something marvelous for them.

MOZART

I'd like to try them someday. I'm

not sure I'd be much good at it.

SCHIKANEDER

'Course you would. You belong here,

my boy, not the snobby Court. You

could do anything you felt like here -

the more fantastic the better! That's

what people want, you know: fantasy.

You do a big production, fill it

with beautiful magic tricks and you'll

be absolutely free to do anything

you want. Of course, you'd have to

put a fire in it, because I've got

the best fire machine in the city

and a big flood - I can do you the

finest water effects you ever saw in

your life. Oh, and a few trick

animals. You'd have to use those.

MOZART

Animals?

SCHIKANEDER

I tell you I picked up a snake in

Dresden last week - twelve foot long  -

folds up to six inches, just like a

paper fan. It's a miracle.

SCHIKANEDER

I'm serious. You write a proper part

for me with a couple of catchy songs,

I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph-

de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be

in German.

MOZART

German!

SCHIKANEDER

Of course! What else do you think

they speak here?

MOZART

No, no, I love that. I'd want it to

be in German. I haven't done anything

in German since Seraglio.

SCHIKANEDER

So there you are. What do you say?

CONSTANZE

How much will you pay him?

SCHIKANEDER

Ah. Well. Ah,

(to Mozart)

I see you've got your manager with

you. Well, Madame, how about half

the receipts?

MOZART

Half the receipts! Stanzi!

CONSTANZE

I'm talking about now. How much will

you give him now? Down payment?

SCHIKANEDER

Down payment? Who do you think I am?

The Emperor? Whoops, I have to go.

SCHIKANEDER

Stay where you are. You're going to

like this next one. We'll speak again.

Triumph-de-luxe, my boy!

CONSTANZE

You're not going to do this?

MOZART

Why not? Half the house!

CONSTANZE

When? We need money now. Either he

pays now, or you don't do it.

MOZART

Oh, Stanzi.

CONSTANZE

I don't trust this man. And I didn't

like what he did with your opera.

It was common.

MOZART

(to Karl)

Well, you liked it, didn't you?

Monkey-flunki-punki.

CONSTANZE

Half the house! You'll never see a

penny. I want it here, in my hand.

MOZART

(dirty)

Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your

hand!

CONSTANZE

Shut up! I'll not let you put anything

in my hand until I see some money.

CUT TO:

SCHLUMBERG

Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What

can I do for you?

MOZART

Is my pupil still anxious to learn

the art of music?

SCHLUMBERG

Well, your pupil is married and living

in Mannheim, young man.

MOZART

Really? Perhaps your dear wife might

care to profit from my instruction?

SCHLUMBERG

What is this, Mozart? What's the

matter with you?

MOZART

Well. Since it appears nobody is

eager to hire my services, could you

favour me with a little money instead?

SCHLUMBERG

What for?

MOZART

If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.

SCHLUMBERG

Well, this is hardly the way to go

about it.

MOZART

No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with

talent, and you with money. If I

offer mine, you should offer yours.

SCHLUMBERG

I'm sorry. No.

MOZART

Please. I'll give it back, I promise.

Please, sir.

SCHLUMBERG

My answer is no, Mozart.

MOZART

Please. Please. Please. Please.

Please. Please.

CUT TO:

VON SWIETEN

(keeping his voice

down)

This is embarrassing, you know. You

introduced Mozart to some of my

friends and he's begging from

practically all of them. It has to

stop.

SALIERI

I agree, Baron.

VON SWIETEN

Can't you think of anyone who might

commission some work from him? I've

done my best. I got him to arrange

some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He

got a fee - what I could afford.

Can't you think of anyone who might

do something for him?

SALIERI

No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is

a lost cause. He has managed to

alienate practically the whole of

Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He

never pays his debts. I can't think

of one person to whom I dare recommend

him.

VON SWIETEN

How sad. It's tragic, isn't it?

Such a talent.

SALIERI

Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter

of fact I think I do know someone

who could commission a work from

him. A very appropriate person to do

so. Yes.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SALIERI

Herr Mozart?

SALIERI

I have come to commission work from

you.

MOZART

What work?

SALIERI

A Mass for the dead.

MOZART

What dead? Who is dead?

SALIERI

A man who deserved a Requiem Mass

and never got one.

MOZART

Who are you?

SALIERI

I am only a messenger. Do you accept?

You will be paid well.

MOZART

How much?

SALIERI

Fifty ducats. Another fifty when I

have the Mass. Do you accept?

MOZART

How long will you give me?

SALIERI

Work fast. And be sure to tell no

one what you do. You will see me

again soon.

CONSTANZE

Wolfi? Wolfi!

CONSTANZE

Who was that?

MOZART

No one.

CONSTANZE

I heard voices.

CONSTANZE

What's the matter?

CONSTANZE

What's that? Oh!

(pouncing on it)

Who gave you this? How much is it?

Wolfi, who gave you this?

MOZART

I'm not telling you.

CONSTANZE

Why not?

MOZART

You'd think I was mad.

OLD SALIERI

My plan was so simple, it terrified

me. First I must get the Death Mass

and then achieve the death.

VOGLER

What?

OLD SALIERI

His funeral - imagine it! The

Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there.

His coffin, Mozart's little coffin

in the middle. And suddenly in that

silence, music. A divine music bursts

out over them all, a great Mass of

Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang

Mozart, composed by his devoted friend

Antonio Salieri. What sublimity!

What depth! What passion in the music!

Salieri has been touched by God at

last. And God, forced to listen.

Powerless - powerless to stop it. I

at the end, for once, laughing at

Him. Do you understand? Do you?

VOGLER

Yes.

OLD SALIERI

The only thing that worried me was

the actual killing. How does one do

that? How does one kill a man? It's

one thing to dream about it. It's

very different when you have to do

it, with your own hands.

CUT TO:

CONSTANZE

Wolfi. Wolfi!

MOZART

No. Don't answer it!

CONSTANZE

Why?

MOZART

Tell him I'm not here. Tell him I'm

working on it. Come back later.

SCHIKANEDER

Am I interrupting something?

CONSTANZE

Not at all.

SCHIKANEDER

(peering into he room)

Where's our friend?

CONSTANZE

He's not in. But he's working on it.

He said to tell you.

SCHIKANEDER

I hope so. I need it immediately.

SCHIKANEDER

Is he happy with it?

SCHIKANEDER

Is this it?

SCHIKANEDER

What the devil is this? Requiem Mass?

Does he think I'm in the funeral

business?

MOZART

Leave that alone!

SCHIKANEDER

Wolfi!

MOZART

Put it down!

SCHIKANEDER

What is this?

MOZART

Put it down, I said! It's nothing

for you.

SCHIKANEDER

Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have

you got for me? Is it finished?

MOZART

What?

SCHIKANEDER

What? The vaudeville, what'd you

think?

MOZART

Yes.

SCHIKANEDER

Can I see it?

MOZART

No.

SCHIKANEDER

Why not?

MOZART

Because there's nothing to see.

SCHIKANEDER

Look, I asked you if we could start

rehearsal next week and you said

yes.

MOZART

Well, we can.

SCHIKANEDER

So let me see it. Where is it?

MOZART

Here. It's all right here, in my

noodle. The rest is just scribbling.

Scribbling and bibbling. Bibbling

and scribbling. Would you like a

drink?

SCHIKANEDER

Look, you little clown, do you know

how many people I've hired for you?

Do you know how many people are

waiting?

CONSTANZE

Leave him alone!

SCHIKANEDER

I'm paying these people. Do you

realize that?

CONSTANZE

He's doing his best.

SCHIKANEDER

I'm paying people just to wait for

you. It's ridiculous!

CONSTANZE

You know what's ridiculous? Your

libretto, that's what's ridiculous.

Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to

work on that stuff!

SCHIKANEDER

Oh yes? And what's so intelligent

about writing a Requiem?

CONSTANZE

Money! Money!

SCHIKANEDER

You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.

CONSTANZE

Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked

for Kings. For the Emperor.

(shouting)

Who are you?

SCHIKANEDER

Listen, Wolfi. Write it. Please.

Just write it down. On paper. It's

no good to anyone in your head. And

fuck the Death Mass.

SALIERI

Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the

matter with you?

LORL

I'm leaving. I'm not working there

anymore. I'm scared!

SALIERI

Why? What has happened?

LORL

You don't know what it's like. Herr

Mozart frightens me. He drinks all

day, then takes all that medicine

and it makes him worse.

SALIERI

What medicine?

LORL

I don't know. He has pains.

SALIERI

Where?

LORL

Here, in his stomach. They bend him

right over.

SALIERI

Is he working?

LORL

I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he

speaks, he doesn't make any sense.

You know he said he saw - he said he

saw his father. And his father's

dead.

SALIERI

Is he working?

LORL

I suppose so. He sits there all he

time, doing some silly opera.

SALIERI

(startled)

Opera? Opera!

LORL

Please don't ask me to go back again.

I'm frightened! I'm very, very

frightened.

SALIERI

(insistently)

Are you sure it's an opera?

MOZART

I don't have it yet. It's not

finished. I'm sorry, but I need more

time.

SALIERI

Are you neglecting my request?

MOZART

No, no! I promise you, I'll give you

a wonderful piece - the best I ever

can!

MOZART

This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been

sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't

I?

CONSTANZE

Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And

he's working on it very hard.

MOZART

Give me two more weeks. Please.

SALIERI

The sooner you finish, the better

your reward. Work!

CONSTANZE

Wolfi, I think you really are going

mad. You work like a slave for that

idiot actor who won't give you a

penny and here. This is not a ghost!

This is a real man who puts down

real money. Why on earth don't you

finish it?

CONSTANZE

Give me one reason I can understand.

MOZART

I can't write it!

CONSTANZE

Why not?

MOZART

It's killing me.

CONSTANZE

No, this is really awful. You're

drunk, aren't you? Be honest - tell

me - you've been drinking. And I'm

so stupid I stay here and listen to

you!

CONSTANZE

It's not fair! I worry about you all

the time. I try to help you all I

can and you just drink and talk

nonsense and - and frighten me! It's

not fair!

MOZART

Go back to bed.

CONSTANZE

Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay

here with you. I promise I won't say

all word. I'll just be here, so you

know no one's going to hurt you.

Please, please!

FRAU WEBER

She's not coming back, you know.

She's gone for good. I did it and

I'm proud of it. 'Leave,' I said.

'Right away! Take he child and go,

just go. Here's the money! Go to the

Spa and get your health back - that's

if you can.' I was shocked. Shocked

to my foundation. Is that my girl?

Can that be my Stanzi? The happy

little moppet I brought up, that

poor trembling thing? Oh, you monster!

No one exists but you, do they? You

and your music! Do you know how often

she's sat in that very chair, weeping

her eyes out of her head because of

you? I warned her. 'Choose a man,

not a baby,' I said. But would she

listen? Who listens? 'He's just a

silly boy,' she says. Silly, my arse.

Selfish - that's all you are. Selfish!

Selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish,

selfish.

fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a

ghost I must fade!

ANDANTE

(encore)

A sweetheart or a pretty little wife

is Papageno's wish. A willing,

billing, lovey dovey Would be My

most tasty little dish.

ALLEGRO

At present the girls only peck me.

Their cruelty surely will wreck me.

But one little beak in my own, And

I'll up to heaven be flown! At present

the girls only peck me. But one little

beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven

be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up

to heaven be flown!

CUT TO:

SALIERI

I'll take care of him.

SALIERI

I have a carriage. Excuse me.

UGLY OLD WOMAN

Here I am, my angel.

PAPAGENO

(appalled)

What? Who the devil are you?

UGLY OLD WOMAN

I've taken pity on you, my angel. I

heard your wish.

PAPAGENO

Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful.

Some people get all the luck.

UGLY OLD WOMAN

Now you've got to promise me

faithfully you'll remain true to me

forever. Then you'll see how tenderly

your little birdie will love you.

PAPAGENO

(nervous)

I can't wait.

UGLY OLD WOMAN

Well, promise then.

PAPAGENO

What do you mean - now?

UGLY OLD WOMAN

Of course now. Right away, before I

get any older.

PAPAGENO

Well, I don't know! I mean you're a

delicious, delightful, delectable

little bird, but don't you think you

might be just a little tough?

UGLY OLD WOMAN

(amorously)

Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my

boy. I'm tender enough for you.

MOZART

What happened? Is it over?

SALIERI

I'm taking you home. You're not well.

MOZART

No, no. I have to get back. I have -

SALIERI

(handing the porter

the lantern)

Thank you. Go.

MOZART

(vaguely singing)

Papa! Papa!

SALIERI

Come now.

SALIERI

Where is your wife?

MOZART

Not here! She's not well, either.

She went to the Spa.

SALIERI

You mean she's not coming back?

MOZART

You're so good to me. Truly. Thank

you.

SALIERI

No, please.

MOZART

I mean to come to my opera. You are

the only colleague who did.

SALIERI

I would never miss anything that you

had written. You must know that.

MOZART

This is only a vaudeville.

SALIERI

Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The

grandest operone. I tell you, you

are the greatest composer known to

me.

MOZART

Do you mean that?

SALIERI

I do.

MOZART

I have bad fancies. I don't sleep

well anymore. Then I drink too much,

and think stupid things.

SALIERI

Are you ill?

MOZART

The doctor thinks I am. But -

SALIERI

What?

MOZART

I'm too young to be so sick.

SALIERI

Shall I answer it?

MOZART

No! No, it's him!

SALIERI

Who?

MOZART

The man. He's here.

SALIERI

What man?

MOZART

Tell him to go away. Tell him I'm

still working on it. Don't let him

in!

MOZART

Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some

money now. Tell him if he would,

that would help me finish it.

SALIERI

Finish what?

MOZART

He knows. He knows!

SCHIKANEDER

Herr Salieri.

SALIERI

Yes, I am looking after him.

SCHIKANEDER

Can we come in?

SALIERI

Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.

SCHIKANEDER

But he's all right?

SALIERI

Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He

became dizzy, that's all. We should

let him rest.

SCHIKANEDER

Well, tell him we were here, won't

you?

SALIERI

Of course.

SCHIKANEDER

And say everything went wonderfully.

A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell

him the audience shouted his name a

hundred times.

SALIERI

Bene.

SCHIKANEDER

I'll call tomorrow.

SALIERI

Yes.

(to the actresses)

And congratulations to all of you.

It was superb.

ACTRESSES

Thank you! Thank you, Excellency!

SCHIKANEDER

Oh, by the way, give him this. This

is his share. That should cheer him

up, eh?

SALIERI

Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all

now. It was perfection - truly!

ACTRESSES

(delighted)

Goodnight, Your Excellency.

Goodnight!

MOZART

What happened?

SALIERI

He said to give you this. And if you

finish the work by tomorrow night,

he will pay you another hundred

ducats.

MOZART

Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow

night? It's impossible! Did he say a

hundred?

SALIERI

Yes. Can I - could I help you, in

any way?

MOZART

Would you? Actually, you could.

SALIERI

My dear friend, it would be my

greatest pleasure.

MOZART

But you'd have to swear not to tell

a soul. I'm not allowed.

SALIERI

Of course.

MOZART

You know, it's all here in my head.

It's just ready to be set down. But

when I'm dizzy like this my eyes

won't focus. I can't write.

SALIERI

Then, let us try together. I'd regard

it as such an honour. Tell me, what

is this work?

MOZART

A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.

CUT TO:

OFFICER

What is it?

CONSTANZE

I want to go!

OFFICER

Where?

CONSTANZE

I want to go back to Vienna.

OFFICER

Now?

CONSTANZE

Yes!

OFFICER

Why?

CONSTANZE

I feel wrong. I feel wrong being

here.

OFFICER

(laying a hand on her

arm)

What are you talking about?

CUT TO:

MOZART

Where did I stop?

SALIERI

(consulting the

manuscript)

The end of the Recordare - Statuens

in parte dextra.

MOZART

So now the Confutatis. Confutatis

Maledictis. When the wicked are

confounded. Flammis acribus addictis.

How would you translate that?

SALIERI

Consigned to flames of woe.

MOZART

Do you believe in it?

SALIERI

What?

MOZART

A fire which never dies. Burning one

forever?

SALIERI

Oh, yes.

MOZART

Strange!

SALIERI

Come. Let's begin.

SALIERI

Confutatis Maledictis.

MOZART

We ended in F Major?

SALIERI

Yes.

MOZART

So now - A minor. Suddenly.

MOZART

The Fire.

SALIERI

What time?

MOZART

Common time.

MOZART

Start with the voices. Basses first.

Second beat of the first measure -

A.

(singing the note)

Con-fu-ta-tis.

(speaking)

Second measure, second beat.

(singing)

Ma-le-dic-tis.

(speaking)

G-sharp, of course.

SALIERI

Yes.

MOZART

Third measure, second beat starting

on E.

(singing)

Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.

(speaking)

And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.

(singing)

Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-

dic-tis.

(speaking)

Do you have that?

SALIERI

I think so.

MOZART

Sing it back.

MOZART

Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of

the first measure - C.

(singing)

Con-fu-ta-tis.

(speaking)

Second measure, fourth beat on D.

(singing)

Ma-le-dic-tis.

(speaking)

All right?

SALIERI

Yes.

MOZART

Fourth measure, second beat - F.

(singing)

Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam-

mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.

MOZART

Now the orchestra. Second bassoon

and bass trombone with the basses.

Identical notes and rhythm.

(He hurriedly hums

the opening notes of

the bass vocal line)

The first bassoon and tenor trombone -

SALIERI

(labouring to keep up)

Please! Just one moment.

MOZART

It couldn't be simpler.

SALIERI

(finishing)

First bassoon and tenor trombone -

what?

MOZART

With the tenors.

SALIERI

Also identical?

MOZART

Exactly. The instruments to go with

the voices. Trumpets and timpani,

tonic and dominant.

SALIERI

And that's all?

MOZART

Oh no. Now for the Fire.

(he smiles)

Strings in unison - ostinato on all -

like this.

MOZART

(speaking)

Second measure on B.

MOZART

(speaking)

Do you have me?

SALIERI

I think so.

MOZART

Show me.

MOZART

(excitedly)

Good, good - yes! Put it down. And

the next measures exactly the same,

rising and rising - C to D to E, up

to the dominant chord. Do you see?

SALIERI

That's wonderful!

MOZART

Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me.

Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down:

sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum

benedictis. Call me among the blessed.

MOZART

C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds.

Altos on C. Sopranos above.

(singing the alto

part)

Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne-

dic-tis.

SALIERI

Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?

MOZART

Yes, and on 'dictis'.

SALIERI

Yes!

MOZART

And underneath, just violins -

arpeggio.

MOZART

(speaking)

The descending scale in eighth notes,

and then back suddenly to the fire

again.

MOZART

(speaking)

And that's it. Do you have it?

SALIERI

You go fast!

MOZART

(urgently)

Do you have it?

SALIERI

Yes.

MOZART

Then let me hear it. All of it. The

whole thing from the beginning -

now!

MOZART

Do you want to rest a bit?

SALIERI

Oh no. I'm not tired at all.

MOZART

We'll stop for just a moment. Then

we'll do the Lacrimosa.

SALIERI

I can keep going, I assure you.

Shall we try?

MOZART

Would you stay with me while I sleep

a little?

SALIERI

I'm not leaving you.

MOZART

I am so ashamed.

SALIERI

What for?

MOZART

I was foolish. I thought you did not

care for my work - or me. Forgive

me. Forgive me!

CONSTANZE

What are you doing here?

SALIERI

Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took

sick. I brought him home.

CONSTANZE

Why you?

SALIERI

I was at hand.

CONSTANZE

Well, thank you very much. You can

go now.

SALIERI

He needs me, ma'am.

CONSTANZE

No, he doesn't. And I don't want you

here. Just go, please.

SALIERI

He asked me to stay.

CONSTANZE

And I'm asking you -

CONSTANZE

Wolfi, I'm back. I'm still very angry

with you, but I missed you so much.

CONSTANZE

I'll never leave you again. If you'll

just try a little harder to be nice

to me. And I'll try to do better,

too. We must. We must! This was just

silly and stupid.

CONSTANZE

What is this?

CONSTANZE

Oh no, not this. Not this, Wolfi!

You're not to work on this ever again!

I've decided.

CONSTANZE

(to Salieri)

This is not his handwriting.

SALIERI

No. I was assisting him. He asked

me.

CONSTANZE

He's not going to work on this

anymore. It is making him ill. Please.

CONSTANZE

(hard)

Please.

CONSTANZE

Thank you.

SALIERI

But - but - but -

CONSTANZE

Good night.

CONSTANZE

I regret we have no servants to show

you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my

wish and go.

SALIERI

Madame, I will respect his. He asked

me to stay here.

CONSTANZE

Wolfi?

(louder)

Wolfi?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VOGLER

Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery

by confessing to murder? You didn't

kill him.

OLD SALIERI

I did.

VOGLER

No, you didn't!

OLD SALIERI

I poisoned his life.

VOGLER

But not his body.

OLD SALIERI

What difference does that make?

VOGLER

My son, why should you want all Vienna

to believe you a murderer? Is that

your penance? Is it?

OLD SALIERI

No, Father. From now on no one will

be able to speak of Mozart without

thinking of me. Whenever they say

Mozart with love, they'll have to

say Salieri with loathing. And that's

my immortality - at last! Our names

will  be tied together for eternity -

his in fame and mine in infamy. At

least it's better than the total

oblivion he'd planned for me, your

merciful God!

VOGLER

Oh my son, my poor son!

OLD SALIERI

Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You

serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart,

not I. Took him, snatched him away,

without pity. He destroyed His beloved

rather than let a mediocrity like me

get the smallest share in his glory.

He doesn't care. Understand that.

God cares nothing for the man He

denies and nothing either for the

man He uses. He broke Mozart in half

when He'd finished with him, and

threw him away. Like an old, worn

out flute.

LOCAL PRIEST

The Lord giveth. The Lord taketh

away. Blessed be the name of the

Lord.

CUT BACK TO:

OLD SALIERI

Why did He do it? Why didn't He kill

me? I had no value. What was the

use, keeping me alive for thirty-two

years of torture? Thirty-two years

of honours and awards.

OLD SALIERI

Being bowed to and saluted, called

'distinguished - distinguished

Salieri' - by men incapable of

distinguishing! Thirty-two years of

meaningless fame to end up alone in

my room, watching myself become

extinct. My music growing fainter,

all the time fainter, until no one

plays it at all. And his growing

louder, filling the world with wonder.

And everyone who loves my sacred art

crying, Mozart! Bless you, Mozart.

ATTENDANT

Good morning, Professor! Time for

the water closet. And then we've got

your favourite breakfast for you -

sugar-rolls.

(to Vogler)

He loves those. Fresh sugar-rolls.

OLD SALIERI

Goodbye, Father. I'll speak for you.

I speak for all mediocrities in the

world. I am their champion. I am

their patron saint. On their behalf

I deny Him, your God of no mercy.

Your God who tortures men with

longings they can never fulfill. He

may forgive me: I shall never forgive

Him.

OLD SALIERI

Mediocrities everywhere, now and to

come: I absolve you all! Amen! Amen!

Amen!

FADE OUT:

THE END
