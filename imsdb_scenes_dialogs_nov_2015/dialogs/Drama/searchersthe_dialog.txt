"THE SEARCHERS"

Revised Final Screenplay by

Frank Nugent

AARON

(incredulous)

Ethan?

ETHAN

Hello, Aaron...

ETHAN

Martha...

MARTHA

(a bit shakily)

Hello, Ethan.

AARON

How's California?

ETHAN

How should I know?

AARON

But Mose Harper said...

ETHAN

That old goat still creakin'

around?... Whyn't someone bury him?

ETHAN

Ben, ain't you?

ETHAN

(frowning at Debbie)

Lucy, you ain't much bigger than

when I saw you last.

DEBBIE

I'm Deborah!

(pointing)

She's Lucy.

MARTHA

Lucy's going on seventeen now...

BEN

An' she's got a beau! Kisses him,

too!

MARTHA

That's enough... Go on inside and

help Lucy set the table... You, too,

Deborah!

ETHAN

(wheeling on him)

MOMENTO!

MARTHA

(contritely)

Martin!... Here we've been standing...

Ethan, you haven't forgotten Martin?

ETHAN

Oh... Mistook you for a half-breed.

MARTIN

(levelly)

Not quite... Quarter Cherokee. The

rest is Welsh... So they tell me.

ETHAN

You've done a lot of growin'...

AARON

It was Ethan found you squallin' in

a sage clump after your folks was

massacred...

ETHAN

(bluntly)

It just happened to be me... No need

to make any more of it...

MARTIN

I'll take care of your horse for

you, Uncle Ethan.

ETHAN

Hold on!

ETHAN

I'll take this...

MARTHA

Supper'll be ready by the time you

wash up... Let me take your coat for

you, Ethan.

MARTHA

(smiling faintly)

And... welcome home.

DISSOLVE TO:

ETHAN

Good.

AARON

Ben! Deborah! Bed!

DEBBIE

But I've got to help with the dishes.

MARTHA

Not tonight... Ben, put that sword

back.

BEN

It's not a sword, ma... it's a saber!

(moving to Ethan)

Did you kill many damYankees with

this sabre, Uncle Ethan?

ETHAN

(matter-of-factly)

Some...

BEN

How many damYankees, Uncle Ethan?

MARTHA

Ben!... Martin, he'll sleep in the

bunkhouse with you tonight.

MARTIN

Good night, Aunt Martha... Uncle

Aaron...

(he hesitates)

Good night, Uncle Ethan.

ETHAN

Night.

BEN

Will you tell me tomorrow about the

war?

AARON

The war ended three years ago, boy!

BEN

It did?... Then whyn't you come home

before now?

MARTHA

BEN!... Go 'long with Martin. MARCH!

DEBBIE

Lucy's wearing the gold locket you

gave her when she was a little girl...

ETHAN

Oh?

DEBBIE

She don't wear it much account of it

makes her neck green.

LUCY

(aghast)

Deborah!

DEBBIE

(defensively)

Well, it does... But I wouldn't care

if you gave me a gold locket if it

made my neck green or not.

ETHAN

'Fraid I...

(then he remembers

something, rises)

Wait.

ETHAN

How about this?

DEBBIE

Oh! LOOK! My gold locket!

MARTHA

It's solid gold... Ethan, I don't

think she's old enough...

ETHAN

Let her keep it... Just something I

picked up in Mexico.

DEBBIE

Oh, thank you, Uncle Ethan...

LUCY

(to Debbie)

Come along...

ETHAN

Passed the Todd place comin' in...

What happened to 'em?

AARON

They gave up... went back to the

cotton rows... So'd the Jamisons...

Without Martha, I don't know... She

wouldn't let a man quit.

AARON

(change of tone)

Ethan, I could see it in you before

the war...

(Ethan looks at him)

You wanted to clear out!

AARON

And you stayed out beyond all need

to... WHY?

ETHAN

(hard)

You askin' me to clear out now?

AARON

(straightening --

with grave dignity)

You're my brother... You're welcome

to stay as long as you got a mind

to... Ain't that so, Martha?

MARTHA

(almost a whisper)

Of course he is.

ETHAN

I expect to pay my own way...

ETHAN

There's sixty double eagles in

there... twelve-hundred dollars.

ETHAN

An' twice that in here.

ETHAN

...only these got the late Emperor

Maximilian's picture on 'em.

AARON

Mint fresh... not a mark on 'em.

ETHAN

So?

ETHAN

Cut yourself?

ETHAN

(softly)

You were always hurting about your

hands.

AARON

Time for bed...

AARON

Night, Ethan... Come 'long, Martha.

DISSOLVE TO:

SAM'S VOICE

Aaron! Open up!... Sam Clayton!

AARON

Reverend... Come in!

CLAYTON

Sorry to get you out of bed so

early...

(as Martha enters,

tightening her wrapper)

Mornin', Sister Edwards.

MARTHA

What is it, Reverend?

CLAYTON

Lars Jorgensen claims someone bust

into his corral last night and run

off his best cows...

AARON

You mean those pure breds he just

bought?

JORGENSEN

Next time I raise pigs, by golly!

You never hear of anyone running off

pigs, I bet you.

MOSE

Injuns has 'em... Caddoes or Kiowas...

Kiowas or Caddoes.

CLAYTON

(irritably)

Caddoes!

MOSE

Respects to a charmin' lady, ma'am.

...Respects, respects...

NESBY

Mornin'...

MARTHA

Coffee's made if you...

CLAYTON

Coffee'd be fine, sister...

MOSE

(an old man's whimper)

My bones is cold...

JORGENSEN

Or bumble bees, by golly... I show

them dirty rustlers!

MOSE

(crooning)

Lookit me, old Mose Harper, rockin'

in a rockin' chair... I'm a-goin' to

set 'n rock, 'n rock, 'n rock, 'n

rock...

CLAYTON

Over here, Martin... Aaron...

CLAYTON

Raise your right hands.

CLAYTON

You are hereby volunteer privates in

Company A of the Texas Rangers and

will faithfully discharge the duties

of same without recompense or monetary

compensation -- meaning no pay!...

Amen and get your shirt on, will

you, Aaron.

AARON

(stubbornly)

Ain't goin' volunteerin' after

rustlers without my morning coffee,

Reverend... Drink your own!

CLAYTON

(sternly -- as he

reaches for his cup)

From now on, call me 'Captain'!

ETHAN

(mockingly)

Captain the Reverend Samuel Johnson

Clayton!... Mighty impressive.

CLAYTON

(dourly)

Well... the prodigal brother...

When'd you get back?

CLAYTON

Haven't seen you since the surrender.

(a pause)

Come to think of it, I didn't see

you at the surrender.

ETHAN

I don't believe in surrenderin'... I

still got my sabre, Reverend... never

turned it into any ploughshare

neither!

JORGENSEN

Is no time for kaffee-klatch while a

man's beef is been run off.

MOSE

Injuns, Ethan...

(taps his nose)

Caddoes or Kiowas... Mose Harper,

drinkin' coffee in a rockin' chair.

...ay-eh!

AARON

Ethan, countin' on you to look after

things while I'm gone.

ETHAN

You ain't goin'...

CLAYTON

He sure is goin'... He's sworn in.

ETHAN

(angrily)

Well, swear him out again!... I'll

go with you.

AARON

Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...

ETHAN

Don't argue!... And stay close...

Maybe they're rustlers... and maybe

this dodderin' old idiot ain't so

far wrong...

MOSE

Thankin' ye, Ethan... thankin' ye.

Kind words...

CLAYTON

(grudgingly)

All right... I'll swear you in...

ETHAN

You can forget that...

(as Sam stares)

Wouldn't be legal anyway.

CLAYTON

Why?

(a pause -- then

shrewdly)

You wanted for a crime, Ethan?

ETHAN

You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain,

Sam?

CLAYTON

I'm askin' as a Ranger of the

sovereign state of Texas.

ETHAN

Got a warrant?

CLAYTON

You fit a lot of descriptions.

ETHAN

(levelly)

I figger a man's only good for one

oath at a time... I took mine to the

Confederate States of America...

(he pauses -- then)

So did you, Reverend...

ETHAN

Stick close, Aaron...

JORGENSEN

Brad!... Is no time for lolly-

gagging...

CLAYTON

Looks like I'll be reading the lines

over that pair before long, sister

Edwards.

JORGENSEN

Is no time for talking weddings...

Better say prayers for those dirty

thieves, by golly... running off a

man's beef...

MOSE

Grateful to the hospitality of yore

rockin' chair, ma'am...

CLAYTON

Let's get on with it...

DEBBIE

WAIT!

DEBBIE

Martin! Ride me as far as the well!

MARTIN

Grab hold!...

AARON'S VOICE

(calling)

DEBORAH!

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

MARTIN

(calling)

Uncle Ethan!

MARTIN

Somethin' mighty fishy about this

trail, Uncle Ethan...

ETHAN

Stop callin' me 'uncle'... I ain't

your uncle.

MARTIN

Yes, sir.

ETHAN

Don't have to call me 'sir' neither...

Nor grampaw neither... Nor Methuselah

neither... I can whup you to a

frazzle.

MARTIN

What you want me to call you?

ETHAN

Name's Ethan... Now what's so mighty

fishy about this trail?

MARTIN

Well, fust off...

JORGENSEN

Look! Look!

JORGENSEN'S VOICE

(excitedly)

Brad! He's found them... Come on!

ETHAN

Call that young fool back!

ETHAN

(angrily)

Caddo or Kiowa, huh?... Ain't but

one tribe uses a lance like that!

MOSE

(almost a whisper)

Ay-he... Comanch!

BRAD

Killed every one -- an' not for food

either... Why'd they do a thing like

that?

ETHAN

Stealing the cattle was just to pull

us out... This here's a murder raid...

(facing Jorgensen)

It shapes up to scald out either

your place... or my brother's.

JORGENSEN

Mama!... Oh please... please no...

BRAD!

CLAYTON

Jorgensen's place is closest... If

they're not there, we'll come straight

on!

MARTIN

Well, come on!

ETHAN

Easy!

(he starts toward his

horse)

It's forty miles, sonny... Horses

can do with some grain and a little

rest.

MOSE

Comanch generally hits at moonrise.

MARTIN

Moonrise!... It'll be midnight

before... I ain't waitin'...!

MOSE

Wisht it was Caddoes... or Kiowas...

(shakes his head)

Comanche...

WIPE TO:

AARON

Think I'll see if I can pick off a

sage-hen or two, Martha...

MARTHA

You do that, Aaron...

AARON

(still pleased with

himself)

Won't go far...

LUCY'S VOICE

My, the days are getting shorter!

MARTHA

(sharply)

Lucy!... We don't need the lamp yet...

MARTHA

(easily)

Let's enjoy the dusk a while.

ON PORCH

Aaron is slowly scanning the terrain.

AARON

(to Ben)

Mind you sweep up them shavin's.

BEN

Yes, Pa...

(undertone -- man to

man)

An' if you see any sage-hens, I'm

ready.

BEN

(quietly)

It's all right, ma... I been

watchin'...  Only I wish...

MARTHA

(quietly)

What, Ben?

BEN

I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't

you, ma?

LUCY

Mother, I can't see what I'm doing!...

MARTHA

NOT YET, LUCY!...

AARON

In the house, boy... and...

AARON

Ben, close the shutters.

LUCY

Pa?

MARTHA

(sudden fear)

Where's Deborah?...

(calling it)

DEBORAH!

DEBBIE

I only took one, ma... Topsy was

hungry.

WIPE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

AARON

LUCY!

LUCY

I'm sorry... I couldn't find the

shawl...

AARON

Hurry, Martha... Moon's fixin' to

rise...

MARTHA

(softly to the child)

We're going to play the sleep-out

game... Remember?... Where you hide

out with grandma?

DEBBIE

Where's she buried?

MARTHA

And you'll go along the ditch --

very quietly -- like a...

(her voice breaks)

DEBBIE

Like a little mouse.

AARON

Now!

MARTHA

There!... And you won't come back or

make a sound... no matter what you

hear? Promise!... No matter what?

DEBBIE

I promise... Wait!

AARON

Child, child!

DEBBIE

Can't I have Topsy to keep me company?

AARON

There's no time...

MARTHA

Here she is, baby... Baby...

AARON

Down low -- go!

AARON

(hoarse whisper)

Here dog... here!

AARON

She reached the ditch...

AARON

She'll be all right, mother... she'll

be all right.

DISSOLVE TO:

MARTIN

(shouting)

Ethan!... Ethan!

MARTIN

(waving)

Uncle Ethan... it's me... Martin!

ETHAN

Out of my way!

MARTIN

(desperately)

Mose! Wait!...

MARTIN

Ethan!... Mose!...

ETHAN (O.S.)

Lucy?... Deborah? Lucy?

ETHAN

(harshly)

You stay out!

ETHAN

Nothing for you to see.

MARTIN

Leggo...

ETHAN

Don't let him go in there, Mose...

ETHAN

(calling)

Lucy -- Lucy!

HERE LIES

MARY JANE EDWARDS

KILLED BY COMANCHES

MAY 12, 1852

a good WIFE & MOTHER In her 41st year

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

CLAYTON

...and to Your keeping we commend

the souls of Aaron... Martha... and

Benjamin Edwards...

CLAYTON

Man that is born of woman is of few

days and full of trouble...

CLAYTON

He cometh forth like a...

ETHAN

(harshly)

Amen!... Put an 'amen' to it!

CLAYTON

...like a flower and is cut down...

Amen!

ETHAN ET AL.

Amen!

CLAYTON

Charlie--you and Brad ride point!

...Don't get too far ahead...

MRS. JORGENSEN

Ethan...

(he turns impatiently)

Those girls mean as much to me as

though they were my own... Maybe you

don't know my Brad's been sittin' up

with Lucy... and my Laurie's real

fond of Martin...

ETHAN

(impatiently)

I'd be obliged if you'd get to the

point, ma'am.

MRS. JORGENSEN

I am... I am... It's just that I

know Martha'd want you to think of

her boys as well as her girls... And

if the girls are... dead... Ethan,

don't let the boys waste their lives

in vengeance!

MRS. JORGENSEN

Promise me, Ethan!

ETHAN

(harshly)

Come on, if you're comin'...

MRS. JORGENSEN

(a heartbroken murmur)

Oh, Martin... Martin...

MARTIN

We'll find them, Mrs. Jorgensen...

We'll find them...

MRS. JORGENSEN

(slowly)

I almost hope they don't find them!

CUT TO:

WIPE TO:

CLAYTON

Another one, eh?

CHARLIE

This 'un come a long way 'fore he

died.

CLAYTON

Well, that's seven we can score up

to your brother, Ethan.

NESBY

I don't like it.

CLAYTON

What don't you like?

NESBY

Injun's on a raid generly hides their

dead so you won't know how many

they've lost... If they don't care

about us knowin', it only spells one

thing... they ain't afraid of us

followin' -- or of us catchin' up

with 'em either.

ETHAN

You can back out any time, Nesby.

NESBY

Didn't say that...

(angrily indicating

Brad)

What's he doin' that for...

CHARLIE

He wants to be sure...

BRAD

(grim)

Let's get along...

ETHAN

(to Brad)

Why don't you finish the job?

CLAYTON

(gravely)

What good does that do?

ETHAN

By what you preach... none!

ETHAN

But by what the Comanche believe --

now he can't enter the spirit land,

but has got to wander forever between

the winds... because I took his mangy

scalp!

DISSOLVE TO:

BRAD

(a whisper)

If only she's alive... I'll make it

up to her... No matter what's

happened... I'll make her forget...

She's just got to be alive...

ETHAN

Get some rest!

DISSOLVE TO:

MOSE

Could be a buffler...

BRAD

It's horses, I tell ya...

ETHAN

It's them all right...

ETHAN

They're camped by the river -- 'bout

twenty miles from here.  Soon's it

gets dark we'll circle out so's to

jump 'em before daybreak.

CLAYTON

(slowly)

You're right sure you want to jump

'em, Ethan?

ETHAN

(touch of defiance)

It's what we're here for, ain't it?

CLAYTON

I thought we were trying to get the

girls back -- alive... We jump those

Comanches, they'll kill 'em... You

know that!

BRAD

(bewildered, angry)

But... but what are we doin' then?...

What are we supposed to do?

CLAYTON

What I had in mind was runnin' off

their hoss herd... A Comanche on

foot is more apt to be willin' to

listen...

NESBY

That makes sense to me.

MARTIN

Yeah...

ETHAN

(angrily)

What do you know about it?... What's

a quarter-breed Cherokee know about

the Comanche trick of sleeping with

his best pony tied right beside him...

You got as much chance of stampedin'

their herd as...

CLAYTON

...as you have of findin' those girls

alive by ridin' into 'em...  I say

we do it my way, Ethan... and that's

an order!

ETHAN

Yes, sir... But if you're wrong,

Captain Clayton, don't ever give me

another!

DISSOLVE TO:

MOSE

Ay-he... They was here...

ETHAN

(to Sam)

SURE!... They WERE here... Now they're

out there... an' waitin' to jump

us!...

ETHAN

You got any more orders, Captain?

CLAYTON

(quietly)

Just keep goin'...

MOSE

(in soft apology)

Jus' bein' sociable, Cap'n...

CLAYTON

(softly)

Keep goin'...

BRAD

(tensely)

Look!

CLAYTON

Easy!

ETHAN

(to Clayton)

If you were tryin' to surround 'em,

you sure succeeded.

CLAYTON

How far's the river from here, Mose?

MOSE

I been baptized, Reverend... yes

suh, been baptized, thank ye...

CLAYTON

Well, you better brace yourself for

another one... Ya-HEE!

CLAYTON

YA-HEE!

CLAYTON

(shouting his orders)

This is as good as any... Charlie,

you and Ed take the horses...

MOSE

(chattily)

Minds me o' the time Joe Powers an'

me fit us some Kiowas...

MARTIN

You think they mean to charge us,

Uncle Ethan...?

MOSE

...We found us an ole buffler

wallow...

BRAD

(staring across river)

Criminy!

ETHAN

Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want

to miss... It makes them think their

medicine's stronger than yours...

MOSE

Ay-he... That's jest what I tole Joe

Powers... That un's gettin' kinda

sassy, ain't he, Ethan?

ETHAN

(grimly)

Real sassy.

CLAYTON

(angrily)

I didn't give any order to fire!

ETHAN

That's all right, Captain... I don't

need any formal invitation to kill a

Comanch...

CLAYTON

(grimly)

You got one now!

ETHAN

Slack your shoulders... Slack 'em...

Your hands'll take care of

themselves...

MOSE

(cackling)

There goes yer scalp, Ethan!...

ETHAN

I still got one out there.

CLAYTON'S VOICE

(quietly)

No, Ethan.

CLAYTON

Let them bury their dead...

ETHAN

That tears it, Reverend... From now

on, you keep out...

(mad now -- facing

the others)

All of you!... I don't want you with

me... I don't need you... for what I

got to do!

CHARLIE

(quietly)

No need to shout, mister.

CHARLIE

Reckon we got to go back -- Ed's

shoulder is smashed -- bad!

NESBY

I can make it... just get me on a

horse...

CLAYTON

No good, Ed... And Ethan's right...

This is a job for a company of

Rangers... or it's a job for one or

two men... Right now we're too many...

an' not enough...

BRAD

(facing Ethan)

Only one way you can stop me lookin'

for Lucy, mister... An' that's kill

me...

MARTIN

That's how I feel, Uncle Ethan...

(correcting the slip)

Ethan, sir.

ETHAN

All right... but I'm givin' the

orders... You take 'em or we split

up here and now...

MARTIN

(quickly)

Why, sure, Ethan... There's just the

one thing we're after... finding

Deborah and Lucy...

ETHAN

(grimly -- turning

away)

If they're still alive...

CLAYTON

You boys got enough shells?

MARTIN

Yeah...

CLAYTON

Vaya con dios.

DISSOLVE TO:

WIPE TO:

BRAD

(shrill)

They got to stop sometime... if

they're human at all, they got to

stop!

ETHAN

Naw... a human man rides a horse

till it dies... then he goes on

afoot... A Comanche comes along...

gets that horse up... and rides it

twenty more miles... Then he eats

it.

ETHAN

(angrily)

Easy on that!

MARTIN

Sorry... We don't even know if Debbie

'n Lucy are with this bunch... Maybe

they split up...

ETHAN

They're with 'em -- if they're still

alive.

BRAD

You've said that enough!... Maybe

Lucy's dead... maybe they're both

dead... but if I hear it from you

again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!

ETHAN

(an aside)

That'll be the day!... Let's ride.

WIPE TO:

MARTIN

Four of 'em cut out here... Why?

ETHAN

I'll take a look... You keep after

the others...

MARTIN

(eagerly)

You want us to fire a shot if...

ETHAN

(disgustedly)

No... nor build bonfires... nor beat

drums neither. I'll meet you on the

far side.

WIPE TO:

ETHAN

Oh... it's you.

ETHAN

(a vague gesture)

I... uh... here's where they met up

again...

ETHAN

(pointing)

Trail leads off there...

BRAD

Why'd they break off?

(no answer)

Was there water in that canyon?

ETHAN

Huh...?  No... no water.

MARTIN

You all right, Ethan?

ETHAN

Huh...?

(more like his usual

gruff self)

Sure I'm all right...

MARTIN

Say!... What happened to your blanket?

Lose it?

ETHAN

Must've... Anyway, I ain't goin'

back to look for it...

DISSOLVE TO:

BRAD

(shouting it)

I saw her!... I saw Lucy!

BRAD

(continuing)

They're camped 'bout two miles over...

I was just swingin' back when I saw

their smoke... I bellied up a ridge

an' they was right below me...

MARTIN

Did you see Debbie?

BRAD

No, but I saw Lucy all right... She

was wearin' that blue dress... an'

she was walkin' along...

ETHAN

(voice flat)

What you saw wasn't Lucy.

BRAD

It was, I tell you!

ETHAN

What you saw was a buck wearin'

Lucy's dress...

(they stare at him)

I found Lucy back there in that

canyon... I wrapped her in my blanket

an' buried her with m'own hands... I

thought it best to keep it from you --

long as I could.

BRAD

Did they...? Was she...?

ETHAN

(blazing)

What've I got to do -- draw you a

picture?... Spell it out?... Don't

ever ask me!... Long as you live

don't ever ask me more!

MARTIN

(frantically)

BRAD!...

CUT TO:

ETHAN

Let's just hope he took some with

him...

MARTIN

What you goin' to do?

ETHAN

Get some sleep... Tomorrow's another

day...

DISSOLVE TO:

WIPE TO:

WIPE TO:

MARTIN

(bitterly)

Say it. We're beat!

ETHAN

(slowly)

No... our turnin' back don't change

anything... not in the long run. If

she's alive, she's safe... for a

while... They'll keep her to raise

as one of their own, 'til she's of

an age to...

MARTIN

And you think we got a chance to

find her?

ETHAN

An Injun will chase a thing til he

thinks he's chased it enough... Then

he quits... Same when he runs...

Seems he never learns there's such a

thing as a critter that might just

keep comin' on... So we'll find them

in the end, I promise you that...

We'll find them just as sure as the

turning of the earth.

FADE OUT

ETHAN

(to Jorgensen)

You got my letter about your son,

Brad?

JORGENSEN

Yah... Just about this time a year

ago...

MRS. JORGENSEN

It came the day before his...

birthday.

JORGENSEN

The Lord giveth--the Lord taketh

away...

MARTIN

I ain't fit to go indoors, miz

Jorgensen... These clothes is...

LAURIE

Martie!

MRS. JORGENSEN

(teasing)

And him probably forgettin' all about

you!... Probably can't even call

your name to mind.

MARTIN

(smiling)

Laurie.

MARTIN

(continuing)

But I fairly forgot just how pretty

you was...

MRS. JORGENSEN

The little one?... Debbie?

DISSOLVE TO:

MARTIN

Hey... What you doin'...?

MARTIN

(a yelp)

Don't go takin' that stuff...

LAURIE

Ain't worth the mendin'...

LAURIE

What you gettin' red-in-the-face

for?... I have brothers, haven't I?

MARTIN

Well I ain't one of 'em!

LAURIE

I'm a woman, Martie...

(he tries to say

something but she

goes right on)

We wash and mend your dirty clothes

all our lives... When you're little

we even wash you... How a man can

ever make out to get bashful in front

of a woman I'll never know...

MARTIN

You talk like a feller might just as

leave run around nekkid...

LAURIE

Wouldn't bother me...

(she heads for the

door)

I wouldn't try it in front of pa,

though, was I you...

ETHAN

...an' then it snowed and we lost

the trail... No need to tell ya all

the places we went... Fort Richardson,

Fort Wingate an' Cobb... the Anadarko

Agency... Trouble is we don't even

know which band that war party

belonged to...

MRS. JORGENSEN

Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.

ETHAN

I got your boy killed.

MRS. JORGENSEN

(gently)

Don't go blamin' yourself...

JORGENSEN

(angrily)

It's this country killed my boy!...

Yes, by golly!

MRS. JORGENSEN

Now Lars!... It so happens we be

Texicans... We took a reachin' hold,

way far out, past where any man has

right or reason to hold on... Or if

we didn't, our folks did... So we

can't leave off without makin' them

out to be fools, wastin' their lives

'n wasted in the way they died... A

Texican's nothin' but a human man

out on a limb... This year an' next

and maybe for a hundred more.  But I

don't think it'll be forever.  Someday

this country will be a fine good

place to be... Maybe it needs our

bones in the ground before that time

can come...

LAURIE

Ma!... Martie's drawers is a sight!

Ain't fit for rags!... Would it be

all right if we gave him some of

Brad's things?

MRS. JORGENSEN

Why...'course it would! They're in

the chest...

JORGENSEN

(rising excitedly)

By golly, the letter... In the chest,

mama... It came for you, Ethan...

last winter...

JORGENSEN

(continuing)

Joab Wilkes of the Rangers brought

it...

ETHAN

(quietly)

Mrs. Jorgensen...

ETHAN

Will you look at this?

MRS. JORGENSEN

Why it's just a snip of calico...

ETHAN

You ever see it before... like mebbe

on a dress Debbie wore?

MRS. JORGENSEN

Yes!... Yes, I remember!... Have

they found her, Ethan?

ETHAN

No... not yet...

ETHAN

(continuing)

...not yet...

MARTIN

Might at least have left me my pants!

LAURIE

Shush!... Time for bed anyway...

(putting clothes near

him)

Likely these'll need some takin'

in... Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted!

...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner

tomorrow and...

JORGENSEN'S VOICE

(calling)

Laurie!... Come... come!

LAURIE

Yes, Pa!... Good night, Martie...

good night, Mr. Edwards...

MARTIN

Good night... Laurie...

ETHAN

Good night...

ETHAN

Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle

with my own...

MARTIN

(staring)

YOUR cattle?... DEBBIE'S cattle!

ETHAN

He's agreed to take you on and share

the increase from my herd while I'm

gone... I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...

MARTIN

I ain't stayin'... I set out lookin'

for Debbie... I aim to keep on...

ETHAN

Why?

MARTIN

Because she's my... my...

ETHAN

She's your nothin'... She's no kin

to you at all!

MARTIN

I always felt like she was... Her

folks takin' me in, raisin' me like

one of their own...

ETHAN

That don't make 'em kin...

MARTIN

All right... I ain't got no kin...

I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's

all.

ETHAN

How? You got any horses, or money to

buy 'em... You ain't even got money

to buy cartridges... Jorgensen's

offering you a good livin' here...

ETHAN

Martin... I want you to know

somethin'...

MARTIN

(turning -- mad as

hell)

Yeah... you want me to know I ain't

got no kin -- no money -- no horses --

nothing but a dead man's clothes to

wear!... You tole me that already...

Now shut your head!

ETHAN

Good night.

DISSOLVE TO:

LAURIE

(quietly)

Ethan rode on... an hour ago.

LAURIE

I don't know what you can do about

finding Debbie that he can't...

LAURIE

He'll find her now, Martie... Please

believe me... I know.

MARTIN

That's what scares me -- him findin'

her.

MARTIN

Laurie, I've seen his eyes when he

so much as hears the word 'Comanche'

...I've seen him take his knife an'

...never mind... But he's a man can

go crazy wild... It might come on

him when it was the worst thing could

be... What I counted on, I hoped to

be there to stop him, if such thing

come.

LAURIE

(slowly)

I hoped I could hold you here... But

I guess I knew... So I stole this

for you...

MARTIN

'I bought a small size dress off a

Injun... If this here is a piece of

yr chiles dress bring reward. I know

where they gone... Jerem Futterman.'

MARTIN

(excited)

Futterman!... He's got a little

tradin' post on the South Fork o'

the Brazos... Laurie, I just got to

get me a good horse! Think yer pa

would...

LAURIE

Finish your breakfast...

MARTIN

I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!

LAURIE

(almost in tears --

but angry)

Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin'

the Fort Worth stud... an' you can

take the light gelding with the

blaze...

MARTIN

But that's Sweet-face -- your own

good horse.

LAURIE

(hysterically)

Take it and welcome... but don't

count on finding me here when you

get back... I've been dallying around

this god-forsaken wind-scour almost

two long years waitin' for you... I

ain't cut out to be an old maid!

MARTIN

(miserably)

I can't help it, Laurie... I just

gotta catch up with Ethan...

'JEREM. FUTTERMAN, TRADER'

MAN

Andale! Andale!

FUTTERMAN

Drink?

ETHAN

(harshly)

How'd you come by this?

FUTTERMAN

You said there'd be a thousand dollar

reward.

ETHAN

That's what I said.

FUTTERMAN

You got it with you?

ETHAN

Reward'll be paid when I find her --

an' if she's alive...

FUTTERMAN

Man's got a right to expect some

kind o' payment... I laid out for

the dress an' sendin' you the

writin'...

ETHAN

Twenty Yankee dollars.

FUTTERMAN

...an' a man's time is worth

somethin'...

ETHAN

Talk!

FUTTERMAN

A young buck fetched it in late last

summer...

(Ethan eases the grip)

Said it belonged to a captive chile

of Chief Scar...

ETHAN

Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.

FUTTERMAN

Me neither... But this buck claimed

he was a big war chief with the

Nawyecky Comanches.

ETHAN

Keep talking.

FUTTERMAN

Scar's band was headin' north... to

winter in at Fort Wingate... eatin'

agency beef. That's what this buck

said... Maybe he lied.

ETHAN

And maybe you lie...

FUTTERMAN

In that case you won't find her --

and I won't get my thousand dollars.

FUTTERMAN

(too casually)

Stay the night if you want...

(Ethan shakes his

head)

Cards?... A jug?... If you'd like

some company, we got a few squaws on

the place...

ETHAN

No thanks.

FUTTERMAN

Don't forget to come back with my

thousand dollars.

ETHAN

Ain't yours yet.

FUTTERMAN

(slight smile)

Bad manners... He shoulda said 'good-

bye.'

DISSOLVE TO:

MARTIN'S VOICE

Acts like somethin's out there.

ETHAN

(heading toward

campfire)

Smells a change in the weather...

ETHAN

Wouldn't surprise me if we didn't

have a frost 'fore mornin'... Here...

(he picks up a saddle

and puts it close to

fire)

Whyn't you bed down closer to the

fire, boy?

MARTIN

Hey! What's the idea...?

ETHAN

Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper --

my bones is cold tonight...

MARTIN

Funny... When we passed through Fort

Wingate last winter, we didn't hear

mention of any Nawyecky Comanche

there...

ETHAN

Not so funny... if you recollect

what 'Nawyecka' means...

MARTIN

What's that?

ETHAN

Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a

man says he's goin' one place when

he means to go just the reverse...

MARTIN

(drowsily)

Oh...

ETHAN

You all settled an' comfortable now?

CUT TO:

ETHAN

Thanks... you did just fine...

MARTIN

(dazed)

Futterman?

ETHAN

He just couldn't wait...

MARTIN

(watching him go

through pockets)

Whatchu doin'?...

ETHAN

Even got my twenty dollars back...

We did all right.

MARTIN

WE?... You just used me for bait --

staked me out like a... buildin' up

the fire... fixin' it so's... I coulda

had my brains blowed out!

MARTIN

(explosively)

Suppose you'd missed!

ETHAN

Never occurred to me...

DISSOLVE TO:

CHARLIE

(calling it)

Howdy, Mister Jorgensen...

JORGENSEN

Charlie...

CHARLIE

Got a letter here...

JORGENSEN

By golly! A letter?

CHARLIE

For Miss Laurie...

MRS. JORGENSEN

Come in, Charlie, come in...

(calling inside)

LAURIE!... My land!... Two letters

in the one year!...

MRS. JORGENSEN

(to Laurie)

A letter for you, Laurie...

CHARLIE

Yes'm... Figgered it might be the

news you been waitin' for... so...

MRS. JORGENSEN

Real good o' you to ride all the way

over, Charlie... Might at least say

your thank you's, Laurie... Declare!

CHARLIE

No need to...

MRS. JORGENSEN

Well?

JORGENSEN

(expectantly)

Yah?

MRS. JORGENSEN

Laurie! Don't keep a body just

standin'!

LAURIE

(impatiently)

I was just readin' to see if...

Anyway, it's MY letter!

MRS. JORGENSEN

(agreeably)

'Course it is. Now let's all get

comfortable an' set so's we can listen

while Laurie reads her letter...

CHARLIE

(turning as if to go)

Maybe I'd better be goin'...

JORGENSEN

You stay, Charlie... After all,

Charlie brought the letter, Laurie...

He got a right to listen too!

LAURIE

(surrendering)

Oh, all right!  Well... Martin says...

JORGENSEN

From the beginning...

LAURIE

'Dear Miss Laury'... He spells it

with a Y instead of an I... E...

Wouldn't you think he'd know...

JORGENSEN

Who cares what he spells it? Read

the letter.

LAURIE

Dear Miss Laury... I take pen in

hand to let you know Ethan and me

still are trying to catch up with

them Comanches the late Mister

Futterman told us about...

LAURIE

The late Mister Futterman?

JORGENSEN

That means Mister Futterman is dead,

by golly.

MRS. JORGENSEN

Wonder what happened to the poor

man.  Go on, Laurie.

LAURIE

(resuming the letter)

We cut north through Indian territory

and...

(her voice fades)

DISSOLVE TO:

MARTIN'S VOICE

Soon we was meeting up with Kiowas

an' Wichitas an' even some Comanches

camped by one of the agencies...

WIPE TO:

MARTIN'S VOICE

But none of them was Nawyecky's nor

claimed to know a war chief named

Scar... He's the one the late Mister

Futterman said had Debbie...

WIPE TO:

MARTIN'S VOICE

At one o' the agencies we outfitted

with all kind an' manner of trade

goods... figgerin' that'd make it

easier for us to come an' go... You'd

laugh if I told you what was our

biggest seller...

WIPE TO:

FIRST AWARD

WIPE TO:

LAURIE

'There is one other thing I got to

tell you before you hear it from

Ethan... How I got myself a wife'...

LAURIE

A WIFE?

CHARLIE

(delightedly)

He did?

JORGENSEN

(smacking his knee --

very happy indeed)

Good! A young man should get married

early in life. Right, mama?

JORGENSEN

Every young man should at least

once...Go on, Laurie! Read!

LAURIE

(haltingly)

A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!

MRS. JORGENSEN

(aghast)

Laurie!

JORGENSEN

(sternly)

Is no way to treat a letter, Laurie

...Mama maybe you better read it...

(to Charlie, proudly)

My wife was a school teacher, Charlie

...She reads good.

LAURIE

I'll read it...

CHARLIE

(smugly)

So he married a Comanche squaw...

Haw haw haw!

WIPE TO:

ETHAN

(quietly)

Let's go... I think I stumbled onto

somethin'...

MARTIN

(eagerly)

Scar?

ETHAN

(angrily)

When are you goin' to learn to keep

your mouth shut! Come on.  Let's get

out of here.

MARTIN

But I just bought a good blanket.

ETHAN

(curtly)

Forget it...

ETHAN

What I heard back there was that a

band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through

this way less'n two weeks ago...

MARTIN

(excitedly)

Think it might be...?

ETHAN

What's she followin' for?

MARTIN

Look, I changed my mind... You can

keep your blanket.

MARTIN

Go on back...

MARTIN

Look... you don't understand...

(he waves her away)

I don't want it.

ETHAN

(explosively)

YOU don't understand, ya chunkhead!

You didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought

her!

MARTIN

(aghast)

What?

ETHAN

You got yourself a wife, sonny!

MARTIN

(a wail)

Oh no! Tell her she's got to go

back...

ETHAN

And have her whole family after our

scalps for floutin' one o' their

women?... No sir! Come on, Mrs.

Pauley...

MARTIN

Mrs... Pauley?

ETHAN

(singing)

I got another gal purtier'n you.  I

got another gal purtier'n you.  I

got another gal purtier'n you.  Skip

to my Lou, my darlin'.

DISSOLVE TO:

MARTIN

Water!...

(in Comanche)

Pah!

ETHAN

That's the way to train 'em. Looks

like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you

a fine beautiful wife...

MARTIN

Cut it out, will ya...

MARTIN

Look... I wish I could explain to

you.

LOOK

Look?...

LOOK

Nay tzare T'sala-ta-komal-ta-name...

unt kang-yah Look.

(which means)

(My father calls me Wild Goose Flying

in the Night Sky... but you call me

'Look').

ETHAN

Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in

the Night Sky... but she'll answer

to Look since it pleases ya...

MARTIN

(blankly)

Look?

MARTIN

(hotly)

I don't think it's so funny... If

you want to do some good, whyn't you

ask her where Scar is?

ETHAN

(grimly)

She heard ya-all right... An' she

knows...

ETHAN

Unt osupanet cah-nay Scar?

(meaning)

(You know where Scar

is?)

ETHAN

You ask her!

MARTIN

Look!

(she faces him)

Scar?...

(sign talk)

Do you know where he went? And if he

has a girl with him... a white girl --

nai-bist pabo taibo...

LOOK

Mah nee-koo-ur?

(meaning)

(Your woman?)

MARTIN

(shaking head)

No... not my wife... My...

(to Ethan)

How do you say sister?

ETHAN

(in Comanche)

Nami.

DISSOLVE TO:

MARTIN

Beats me how she could get that pony

out o' camp without neither of us

hearin' a thing...

ETHAN

She ain't goin' back to her family,

that's certain... not if she took

off where the arrow points.

MARTIN

Think she means for us to follow?

ETHAN

How should I know... She's YOUR wife!

MARTIN

I think maybe we oughta...

ETHAN

(hiding a grin)

Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say

that... Bein' a new husband and all...

DISSOLVE TO:

LAURIE

Maybe she left other signs for us to

follow but we'll never know -- 'cause

it snowed all day and all the next

week... We were heading north, through

the buffalo country when something

happened that I ain't got straight

in my own mind yet...

(her voice fades)

MARTIN'S VOICE

Ethan's always been throwing it up

to me that I'm a quarter-breed... I

never figgered it made much

difference...

MARTIN'S VOICE

But this day we came on a small herd.

We needed some meat so we circled

'round...

MARTIN'S VOICE

...and came up on 'em afoot...  They

hadn't been hunted, so it was no

trick workin' in close.

MARTIN'S VOICE

Ethan got a nice one on his first

shot, but then he began killing one

after another -- cows as well as

bulls -- fast as he could fire and

load... It was just a slaughter...

no sense to it...

MARTIN

Ethan, quit it!

ETHAN

(firing again)

Nine...

(another shot)

Ten!

MARTIN

What's the sense in it!

ETHAN

(in a fury)

Hunger! -- Empty bellies! That's the

sense in it, you Cherokee!...

ETHAN

Least, THEY won't feed any Comanches

this winter... Killin' buffalo's as

good as killin' Injuns in this

country.

MARTIN

Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo,

too....

ETHAN

Ain't that too bad... If you feel

that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm

surprised you didn't take up with

that squaw wife of yours...

MARTIN

ETHAN!

MARTIN

Listen!... Hear it?... There! Ain't

that a bugle... and firing?

ETHAN

(grimly)

Just hope we ain't too late...

DISSOLVE TO:

MARTIN'S VOICE

(as narrator)

It was all over long before we got

there and the soldiers was high-

tailin' it back to the agency with

their prisoners -- squaws mostly --

by the time Ethan and me reached the

camp...

MARTIN'S VOICE

It was the Nawyecky Comanches all

right -- the ones we'd been looking

for all this time...

MARTIN'S VOICE

Trouble of it was that the soldiers

had hit when most of the fightin'

men was away -- huntin' maybe... So

most of the dead was old men and

women an' kids... And it was in one

of the tepees Ethan found her -- the

little squaw who wanted me to call

her Look...

ETHAN

Well, you're a widower now...

MARTIN

(angrily)

What'd the soldiers have to kill her

for!...

MARTIN

Ethan!

MARTIN

Look! It's hers, Debbie's...

MARTIN'S VOICE

So we knew Debbie had been in the

village... What Look was doing there --

whether she'd come to warn them, or

maybe to find Debbie for me... there's

no way of knowing...

MARTIN

We gotta catch up with them yellow

legs... Maybe they got her with them.

ETHAN

(harshly)

And maybe they got Scar!

DISSOLVE TO:

OFFICER

(inquiringly)

Yes?

ETHAN

We're looking for a girl -- a white

girl...

MARTIN

She'd be about thirteen now...

OFFICER

We got two around that age...

MARTIN

(eagerly)

Where?

OFFICER

You'll have to wait until we reach

the agency... Fall in behind the

column...

MARTIN

(protestingly)

But couldn't you...?

OFFICER

Sorry...

(shouting it)

Keep the column moving!... Close

ranks there!

WIPE TO:

GENERAL

And it was clear to me the hostiles

outnumbered us four to one... with

all the advantage of terrain...

CORRESPONDENT

Four to one! What did you do, general?

GENERAL

(impressively)

Sir -- we charged!... Gentlemen --

and I hope you will quote me -- I

cannot say too much for the courage

of the men who followed me into that

Cheyenne camp...

ETHAN

(blurting it)

Cheyenne! What Cheyenne?

GENERAL

(turning and staring)

I beg your pardon?

ETHAN

That camp you hit was Nawyecka

Comanche... Chief Scar's bunch...

CORRESPONDENT

(fascinated)

Scar? What a wonderful name!...

GENERAL

(to his aide)

Are you getting this, Keefer?

CORRESPONDENT

(to Ethan)

How do you spell that word --

Nawyecka?

ETHAN

My name's Edwards... I'm looking for

my niece... she was in that camp

when you attacked...

GENERAL

(uncertain)

Well... I know there were some

captives recovered...

MARTIN

(bitterly)

Four of 'em dead... so we were told...

GENERAL

(uncomfortably)

Unfortunately, the hostiles murdered

them as we developed the village...

ETHAN

Are you sure they didn't die of

carbine shots fired by a bunch o'

Yank bluebellies so scared they

couldn't tell the difference between

a Cheyenne and a Comanche?

GENERAL

Keefer!... Put this man under arrest!

ETHAN

That'll be the day...

(scornfully)

'As we developed the village'...

Next time you develop a village, hit

it where the fightin' men are...

You won't get any headlines for

killin' squaws.

KEEFER

Shall I show him the captives, sir?

GENERAL

Just get him out of here!

KEEFER

Yes sir...

(he crosses to Ethan)

This way...

MARTIN

Debbie?... DEBBIE?

MARTIN

Don't be scared, ma'am...

KEEFER

Just don't pay any attention to her...

MARTIN

(softly)

Debbie?

GIRL

Pabo-taibo!

(White man!)

The other girl has risen almost in

the same instant -- but more out of

fear. She is younger, but painted

like the other. She moves to stand

behind the savage one.

MARTIN

(slowly)

No... She's not...

ETHAN

I ain't sure... Where's that doll?

KEEFER

Was your niece about their age?

ETHAN

Not far from it...

KEEFER

Hard to realize they're white, isn't

it...

ETHAN

(grimly)

They're not white any more -- they're

Comanche!... Let's see the bodies...

ETHAN

I don't need you...

KEEFER

(the dispassionate

pro)

I'd like you to see them all... It

might help us identify them... Shot

in the head -- flash-burn range...

The boy got his skull cracked...

Here's the girl...

ETHAN

No...

ETHAN

Well, we only got the one lead --

Scar... And where we begin to look,

I don't know...

KEEFER

There's one thing. We recovered a

bushel of trinkets in that camp...

cheap stuff... trade goods... Couldn't

help noticing that most of it was

Mexican... Maybe if you could talk

to some of those Mexican traders

along the border... What do they

call themselves?

ETHAN

Comancheros...

KEEFER

That's the breed... Course it might

take time.

ETHAN

Time's running out... But I'm obliged

to you.

CUT TO:

LAURIE

...so we're setting out for New Mexico

Territory in the morning... I am

And you knittin' that muffler...

LAURIE

(impatiently)

What's the difference!

MRS. JORGENSEN

Well, I just thought it would be a

sin and a shame not to let SOMEONE

get some good of it...

LAURIE

(peering closely)

There's a word crossed out... It

looks like 'I wish' or 'I will'...

(she gives up)

Anyway... 'I set pen aside in the

hope you are enjoying good health

respectfully...

(forlornly)

yours truly, Martin Paulie.'

JORGENSEN

They never find that girl.

LAURIE

I don't care if he never comes back!

MRS. JORGENSEN

without conviction)

Now, Laurie!...

MRS. JORGENSEN

Charlie, you'll stay for supper?...

Now I won't take no for an answer.

Suit yourself... While you're enjoyin'

your little conversation, I'll be

ridin' out with Senor Fernandez

here...  The Comanch' medicine country

ain't far... there's one camp with a

chief named Cicatriz.

MARTIN

Never heard of him...

Cicatriz is Mex for Scar... an' he

EMILIO

Buena suerte, Estrella... Hasta la

Senores! This is Cicatriz!

Pabbo-tie-bo kim te-moo-er.

(The gringos want to

trade.)

ETHAN

That's right... We come to trade...

Only not out here...

(with sign language

accompaniment)

I don't stand talkin' in the wind.

EMILIO

(sharply)

Miguel... caballo -- aca!

EMILIO

Co-bay tabitz-chat.

(meaning)

(Very fine horse.)

ETHAN

(to Martin)

Stay out here.

MARTIN

Not likely.

SCAR

Pie-kay! (Clear out!)

(then he turns to the

white men)

IH-CARD!

(Sit!)

EMILIO'S VOICE

His sons are dead... So his wives

sit on the honor side of his lodge.

ETHAN

(glancing at them)

Are those his wives too?

SCAR

Two sons -- killed by white men...

For each son, I take many scalps...

(in Comanche)

Mayah-kay zee-eh!...

(Bring the lance!)

SCAR

(louder)

MAYAH-KAY ZEE-EH!

SCAR

(in Comanche)

Pie-kay!

(Go!)

ETHAN

(his voice controlled)

I've seen scalps before...

SCAR

This before?

ETHAN

(to Emilio)

I came to trade, not to admire his

collection... Tell him we're going

to pitch camp across the crick...

Maybe we can talk trade tomorrow.

SCAR

(in Comanche)

Ee-sap! Pabbo-tie-bo ee-sap!

(He lies! The gringo

lies!)

EMILIO

(placatingly)

Tomorrow -- manana -- 'puetze.'

SCAR

Puetze!

EMILIO

(urgently)

Walk with dignity!

(after a moment; lips

hardly moving)

If you gringo heretics have any

prayers, say them...

MARTIN

(transfigured)

She's alive... Can you believe it,

she's alive... alive... An' we found

her...

EMILIO

(fervently)

Please!... I, too, am alive... I

wish to stay that way.

EMILIO

(to his men)

Vamanos!

WIPE TO:

EMILIO

You understand, senores... It is not

that I am cobarde... cowardly...

ETHAN

Don't apologize... You did your job...

EMILIO

He knows you -- who you are -- and

why you are here... This I did not

understand... or I would not... even

for gold, senores... have led you

here.

EMILIO

Take it. I do not want blood money.

Vaya con Dios!

MARTIN

You figger Scar means to kill us?

ETHAN

He's got to... All these years,

runnin', dodgin', knowin' we were

after him... Now we caught up...

It's him or us.

MARTIN

Why didn't he make his move back

there?

ETHAN

I don't know... Somethin' tied his

hands... maybe hospitality...

MARTIN

(barely breathing the

name)

Debbie...?

DEBBIE

(in Comanche)

Unnt-meah!

(Go away!)

Both men move closer. She takes a

frightened step back, as if to run.

MARTIN

Debbie... Don't you remember me? I'm

Martin.

DEBBIE

(in Comanche)

Unnt-meah!

MARTIN

(softly)

We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without

you, Debbie... Ethan, get the

horses... I'll try to keep her

talkin'...

ETHAN

(harshly)

How? She's even forgot her own

language!

MARTIN

Debbie, you're comin' with us!  Hear

me?

DEBBIE

No... not now... not ever.

MARTIN

I don't care what they've done to

you... what happened...

DEBBIE

(angrily)

They have done... nothing... They

are my people...

ETHAN

Your people? They murdered your

family!

DEBBIE

(reverting to Comanche)

Ee-sap!

(furiously)

White men killed them - to steal

cows! I was... little... I ran away...

They find me... take care of me.

MARTIN

No Debbie! That ain't what happened!

They been lyin' to you...

DEBBIE

You lie! All white men lie... and

kill...

MARTIN

Debbie, think back! I'm Martin...

remember? Remember how I used to let

you ride my horse? Tell you stories?

Don't you remember me, Debbie?

DEBBIE

I remember... from always... At first

I prayed to you... come and get me...

take me home... You didn't come...

MARTIN

I've come now...

DEBBIE

These are my people...

(in Comanche)

Unnt-meah! Go! Go! Please!

ETHAN

(grimly)

Stand aside, boy...

MARTIN

Ethan -- NO!

MARTIN

Debbie! WAIT!

ETHAN

(angrily)

Never mind her! MOVE!

ETHAN

(angrily)

Go on! Get out of here while you

can...

MARTIN

(pointing to the cave)

Over there!

ETHAN

They'll be back...

MARTIN

We won't be here... Come on!

DISSOLVE TO:

ETHAN

Martha... Martha!

MARTIN

I gotta open that leg and let the

poison out...

ETHAN

Wait...

ETHAN

Just in case... Read it.

MARTIN

'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound

mind and without any blood kin, do

hereby bequeath all my property of

any kind to Martin Pauley...'

(he stares, then)

I don't want your property.... 'Sides,

what do you mean no 'blood kin?'

Debbie's your blood kin...

ETHAN

Not no more.

MARTIN

(angrily)

You can keep your will!

(he thrusts it back

into Ethan's shirt)

I ain't forgettin' you was all set

to shoot her yourself... What kind

o' man are you, anyway.

ETHAN

(sitting up -- eyes

blazing)

She's been with the bucks! She's

nothin' now but a...

MARTIN

(a shout)

Shut your dirty mouth!

MARTIN

(slowly)

I hope you die!

DISSOLVE TO:

FADE OUT

JORGENSEN

(shouting)

They're here, mama... Come in, come

in...

CLAYTON

Here he is, Lars... Combed, curried

'n washed behind the ears!

MRS. JORGENSEN

Why, Charlie, you look real handsome!

CHARLIE

(grinning)

Yes'm... scarcely reck'nize myself...

Where's Laurie?

MRS. JORGENSEN

You'll see her soon enough...

CLAYTON

(nodding to the music)

Say, that music sounds so good it

must be sinful...

MRS. JORGENSEN

Grab a partner, reverend!

CLAYTON

Well, now, a man of my age just can't

haul off and dance in cold blood...

but if there's any of that wild cherry

brandy of yours, Lars...

JORGENSEN

(suddenly sober)

Nooo...

(change of heart)

Yah, by golly... One jug left... I

get it!

MRS. JORGENSEN

Last winter that man swore up and

down there wasn't a drop left -- and

me with pneumoney!... Reverend, you'd

better start clergyin' again!

JORGENSEN

(hailing them)

Hi!... You're late... hurry...

JORGENSEN

(staring)

Ethan... Martie... No, don't get

down! ...You can't come in!

JORGENSEN

The Rangers are here!

ETHAN

What's that got to do with us?

MARTIN

(eyeing the house)

What's goin' on?

JORGENSEN

(who's forgotten they

wouldn't know)

Why, my Laurie's getting married...

JORGENSEN

Wait! Don't you hear me! The

Rangers...

MARTIN

So what?

JORGENSEN

You been posted for murder... both

of you... That trader fella, the

late Mister Futterman...

MARTIN

I gotta see Laurie!

JORGENSEN

(desperately)

Go around the side... the

grandmother's room... I'll tell her...

PLEASE!

MARTIN

You better!

JORGENSEN

Quick... hide in the barn, Ethan...

ETHAN

Hide? Why would I?

JORGENSEN

Look everybody... Look who's...

ETHAN

(to all)

Evenin'... evenin' Reverend... or do

I call you 'Captain'...?

CLAYTON

Came here for a wedding, Ethan...

Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend'

will do...

MRS. JORGENSEN

(coming forward)

And news of our little girl, Ethan?

ETHAN

She's not a little girl any more.

MRS. JORGENSEN

(eyes wide)

You've seen her!... She's alive?

ETHAN

I've seen her... and she's alive.

CUT TO:

LAURIE

(quietly)

Hello, Martie....

MARTIN

I... I wrote you a letter... Reckon

you didn't get it...

LAURIE

(setting the lamp

down)

One letter in five years... I read

it till the paper dried up and the

writing faded out...

MARTIN

It wasn't much of a letter...

LAURIE

No, it wasn't... You mighta said you

loved me... You mighta asked me to

wait... At least that'd have been

something...

MARTIN

But I allus loved you... You know

that, without my sayin' it... I

couldn't bring myself to ask you to

wait... the little I had... not

knowin' how much longer until we

found Debbie...

LAURIE

(breaking)

It isn't fair...

LAURIE

(sobbing)

It isn't fair, Martin Pauley, and

you know it!

MARTIN

Don't cry, Laurie... I understand

how it is... I'll just go 'way...

LAURIE

(spinning on him)

You do and I'll die, Martie... I

will! I'll just die!

CHARLIE

I'll thank you to leave the room,

Laurie.

MARTIN

(incredulous)

Charlie MacCorry!... You weren't

fixin' to marry HIM??

CHARLIE

She sure is!... An' don't think your

comin' back is goin' to change it!

MARTIN

As to that, I don't know, Charlie...

We hadn't got around to talkin'

marriage...

CHARLIE

What right you got to be talkin'

marriage to any decent woman...

MARTIN

(angrily)

If you're talkin' about that crazy

murder charge...

CHARLIE

AND other things... Mebbe you thought

you was gettin' away with being

comical about that Indian wife you

took... I bet she wasn't the first

squaw you...

LAURIE

Stop it! Both of you... I won't have

any fighting in this house.

MARTIN

It's all right... Charlie, let's

move outside.

CHARLIE

I ain't wearing no gun.

CLAYTON

(yelling)

Sergeant MacCorry!

CLAYTON

Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?

CHARLIE

(regaining his balance)

No sir... pleasure.

CLAYTON

In that case, give the boys room...

CLAYTON

Fight fair, son... Use your fists!

ETHAN

(drily)

Comanches don't use their fists,

reverend... Let 'em alone...

MARTIN

Could scalp him... but I'll just

count coup!

CLAYTON

You all right, sergeant?

CHARLIE

Dunno... Seems so.

CLAYTON

Well, go get cleaned up and we'll

proceed with the weddin'...

CHARLIE

Ain't goin' to be any weddin' -- not

till we get a few things cleared up

'round here...

WIPE TO:

NESBY

(a grin)

Well... it was a nice weddin' party...

considerin' no one got married...

'Night.

JORGENSEN

Good night, Ed...

JORGENSEN

Now, mamma!...

CLAYTON

I got to ask you and Martin to ride

to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.

ETHAN

This an invite to a necktie party,

Reverend?

CLAYTON

Captain... Nope, wouldn't say that...

Likely you had your reasons for

killin' Futterman... Probably needed

killin'... I'm speaking as a ranger

now, not as a reverend... Fact that

all three was shot in the back is

the only thing that's raised some

question -- that and a missin' gold

piece known to have been on him just

prior to his demise.

ETHAN

(casually)

That so?

MARTIN

I ain't goin' to Austin, Reverend.

CHARLIE

You're goin' if the captain says

you're goin'...

CLAYTON

Now, now... let's not grow

disputatious...

CLAYTON

(turning)

What's that? More company?

CLAYTON

Kinda late getting here, aren't they?

LIEUTENANT'S VOICE

Hello there! Captain Clayton?

LIEUTENANT

Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?

CLAYTON

I'm Clayton.

LIEUTENANT

(doubtfully)

You're Captain Clayton?...

LIEUTENANT

(recovering, he salutes)

Colonel Greenhill's compliments,

sir.

CLAYTON

Hold on, son... Who's this Colonel

Greenhill you're talking about?

LIEUTENANT

Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel

Greenhill, sir... Commanding Officer,

Fifth U.S. Cavalry... I'm Lieutenant

Greenhill, sir.

CLAYTON

Oh... Now what's this your pa wants

to know?

LIEUTENANT

My pa wants to know... Colonel

Greenhill wants to know how soon you

could put a company of your Rangers

in the field, fully armed and

equipped, for joint punitive action

against the Comanches.

CLAYTON

JOINT action?

LIEUTENANT

Yes sir... We've received information

about a band of Comanches under a

chief named Scar...

ETHAN

What information?

LIEUTENANT

That maybe he's not far from here --

holed up somewhere, waiting his chance

to get back over the border... He

raided north about a month ago...

ran into more army than he bargained

for... Now he's running for cover,

for keeps this time...

CLAYTON

And what makes you think he's in

this territory?

LIEUTENANT

Yesterday, one of our patrols picked

up a man claims he was a prisoner

with Scar till only two days ago...

He talks crazy but I brought him

along... Says he lives here... keeps

mentioning a rocking chair.

ETHAN

(half to himself)

Mose...

ETHAN

MOSE!

MOSE'S VOICE

Ay-he?... Ay-eh?...

MOSE

Come f'r my rockin' chai'... ole

Mose.

ETHAN

(shouting it)

Where's Scar, Mose... SCAR?

MARTIN

Ask him about Debbie!... Is she all

right, Mose?

MOSE

My rockin' chai'...

MRS. JORGENSEN

(bustling over)

Leave the poor man be! Can't you see

he's out of his mind...

ETHAN

Mose... try to remember!... You were

in Scar's camp...

MOSE

Ay-he... Made out I was crazy...

(he giggles foolishly)

Ate dirt... chewed grass... I fooled

'em, Ethan!... an' I got away...

ETHAN

Scar! Where's he holed in?

MOSE

Seven Fingers... ay-he... Seven...

MRS. JORGENSEN

Now that's enough!  Here... by the

fire... What you need's a good bowl

of soup...

ETHAN

(blankly)

Seven Fingers?

LIEUTENANT

That's what he told us... but there's

no such place on the maps.

MARTIN

Wait a minute! Isn't that the Caddo

name for where all those canyons

branch on the Malapai?

MOSE

(from his rocker)

Caddo or Kiowa... ay-he... ay-eh...

CLAYTON

You tell your pa a company of Rangers --

all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed

an' equipped will be in the field by

daylight... headin' for the south

end of the Malapai. If he can catch

up with us, well an' good...

LIEUTENANT

But... but captain, we can't possibly

take the field tomorrow... for your

own protection...

CLAYTON

Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers,

complete with Texican scalps an'

white girl captive... You want to

protect us, you just get out of our

way... Now skedaddle!

CLAYTON

Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby

appointed civilian scouts -- without

pay... Charlie, hightail it to

headquarters an' spread the word...

CHARLIE

Yes sir...

MARTIN

My guns...

LAURIE

Martie... don't go! Not this time.

MARTIN

(staring)

You crazy?

LAURIE

It's too late... She's a woman grown

now...

MARTIN

I got to fetch her home...

LAURIE

Fetch what home?... The leavin's of

Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again

to the highest bidder?... With savage

brats of her own, most like?...

MARTIN

(shouting it)

Laurie! Shut your mouth!

LAURIE

Do you know what Ethan will do if he

has a chance?... He'll put a bullet

in her brain! And I tell you Martha

would want him to!

MARTIN

Only if I'm dead!

CLAYTON

You ready?

MARTIN

(eyes never leaving

Ethan's face)

I'm ready.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

ETHAN

We can get within 500 yards... there's

a hogback to the south.

CLAYTON

How many, would you say?

ETHAN

(drily)

Enough to go around... I'd say about

a dozen apiece... Mount 'em up!

MARTIN

Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll

kill her... and you know it.

ETHAN

(calmly)

It's what I'm countin' on.

MARTIN

I know you are... Only it ain't goin'

to be that way... she's alive...

ETHAN

Livin' with Comanches ain't bein'

alive...

MARTIN

(same tone)

She's alive... Better she's alive

and livin' with Comanches than her

brains bashed out...

CLAYTON

Now son, it's a bitter thing to say,

but there's more than your sister at

stake here.

ETHAN

There sure is! I'm going to tell you

somethin'... I wasn't going to speak

of it... But I'll tell you now.  Did

you notice them scalps strung on

Scar's lance?

(MARTIN NODS)

Did you see the third scalp from the

point of the lance? Long... wavy

hair...

MARTIN

I saw it... And don't try to tell me

it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...

ETHAN

You don't remember it, but I remember.

That was your mother's scalp!

ETHAN

I didn't want to tell you... but

maybe it's your right to know.

CLAYTON

(quietly)

Now mount up, son...

MARTIN

It don't change it... All I'm askin'

is a chance to sneak in there... an'

try to get her out before you come

chargin' in.

CLAYTON

What if you're caught?

MARTIN

It won't tell 'em anything, will it!

Just a man alone...

ETHAN

I say NO!

CLAYTON

Go ahead, son... But at the first

alarm, we're comin' in -- and we

ain't goin' to have time to pick and

choose our targets when we do...

ETHAN

It's your funeral...

CHARLIE

Here... you fight like a Comanch...

Maybe this'll help ya pass as one.

CLAYTON

What in...?

GREENHILL

(calling -- still

distant)

Captain Clayton... Captain!

CLAYTON

(exploding)

Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler

sound the charge while you're at

it??

GREENHILL

(blankly)

Sir?

CLAYTON

Never mind... Your pa know you're

out here?

GREENHILL

Yes, sir... Troop's about ten miles

back... The Colonel sent me looking

for you...

CLAYTON

(dismissing him)

Well you found me... Good work, son...

Good work.

GREENHILL

If there's anything I can do, sir...

CLAYTON

(under his breath)

God forbid... No, son, you flog on

back and tell your pa where we're

at... and where he's at...

GREENHILL

But he knows THAT, sir... Can't I

stay, sir?

CLAYTON

(reluctantly)

All right... But keep your eye on

me, boy... I'm the hard case you're

up against here -- not these childish

savages... If you don't hear me first

time I holler, you better read my

mind... I don't aim to raise no two

hollers on any subject at hand...

GREENHILL

Yes, sir...

CLAYTON

Watch that knife, boy!

COMANCHE

Tahbo.

(A rabbit.)

CLAYTON

The State of Texas is payin' you

boys $12 a month. Here's your chance

to earn it... Now I don't want any

foolin' around after scalps. We ain't

got the time... Yankee cavalry's on

its way here to set those Comanches

free... We gotta beat 'em to it --

our way... Now mount an' guide center

on young Greenhill here. Son, you

just follow me... And WATCH THAT

KNIFE!

MARTIN

(a hoarse whisper)

Debbie... don't!

MARTIN

(grimly)

I'm takin' you whether you want to

or not...

DEBBIE

(a scream)

MARTIN!

CLAYTON

For these Thy gifts which we are

about to receive...

(donning his hat, he

turns to the bugler)

Sound that horn, son, and Leave Us

Go Amongst Them...YA-HEE!

MARTIN

No, Ethan! NO!

ETHAN

(quietly)

I'm sorry, girl... Shut your eyes...

ETHAN

(softly)

You sure favor your mother...

WIPE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

COLONEL

Clayton, if you were in my command

I'd have you courtmartialed for this!

CLAYTON

(angrily, to MacCorry)

Hurry it up!

COLONEL

What's the matter, sir... You wounded?

What is it, Sergeant -- a bullet or

an arrow?

FADE OUT
