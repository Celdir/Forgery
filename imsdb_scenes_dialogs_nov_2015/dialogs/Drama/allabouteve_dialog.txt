ADDISON'S VOICE

The Sarah Siddons Award for

Distinguished Achievement is

perhaps unknown to you. It has been

spared the sensational and

commercial publicity that attends

such questionable "honors" as the

Pulitzer Prize and those awards

presented annually by the film

society...

ADDISON'S VOICE

The distinguished looking gentleman

is an extremely old actor. Being an

actor - he will go on speaking for

some time. It is not important what

you hear what he says.

ADDISON'S VOICE

However it is important that you

know where you are, and why you are

here. This is the dining room of

the Sarah Siddons Society.

The occasion is its annual banquet

and presentation of the highest

honor our Theater knows - the Sarah

Siddons Award for Distinguished

Achievement.

ADDISON'S VOICE

These hollowed walls, indeed many

of these faces, have looked upon

Modjeska, Ada Rehan and Minnie

Fiske; Mansfield's voice filled the

room, Booth breathed this air. It

is unlikely that the windows have

been opened since his death.

ADDISON'S VOICE

The minor awards, as you can see,

have already been presented. Minor

awards are for such as the writer

and director - since their function

is merely to construct a tower so

that the world can applaud a light

which flashes on top of it and no

brighter light has ever dazzled the

eye than Eve Harrington. Eve... but

more of Eve, later. All about Eve,

in fact.

ADDISON'S VOICE

To those of you who do not read,

attend the Theater, listen to

uncensored radio programs or know

anything of the world in which we

live - it is perhaps necessary to

introduce myself. My name is

Addison deWitt.

My native habitat is the Theater -

in it I toil not, neither do I

spin. I am a critic and

commentator. I am essential to the

Theater - as ants are to a picnic,

as the ball weevil to a cotton

field...

ADDISON'S VOICE

This is Karen Richards. She is the

wife of a playwright, therefore of

the Theater by marriage. Nothing in

her background or breeding should

have brought her any closer the

stage than row E, center...

ADDISON'S VOICE

... however, during her senior year

in Radcliffe, Lloyd Richards

lectured on drama. The following

year Karen became Mrs. Lloyd

Richards. Lloyd is the author of

'Footsteps on the Ceiling' - the

play which has won for Eve

Harrington the Sarah Siddons

Award...

ADDISON'S VOICE

There are two types of theatrical

producers. One has a great many

wealthy friends who will risk a tax

deductible loss. This type is

interested in Art.

ADDISON'S VOICE

The other is one to whom each

production mean potential ruin or

fortune. This type is out to make a

buck. Meet Max Fabian. He is the

producer of the play which has won

Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons

Award...

ADDISON'S VOICE

Margo Channing is the Star of the

Theater. She made her first stage

appearance, at the age of four, in

'Midsummer Night's Dream'. She

played a fairy and entered - quite

unexpectedly - stark naked. She has

been a Star ever since.

ADDISON'S VOICE

Margo is a great Star. A true Star.

She never was or will be anything

less or anything less...

(slight pause)

... the part for which Eve

Harrington is receiving the Sarah

Siddons Award was intended

originally for Margo Channing...

ADDISON'S VOICE

Having covered in tedious detail

not only the history of the Sarah

Siddons Society, but also the

history of acting since Thespis

first stepped out of the chorus

line - our distinguished chairman

has finally arrived at our reason

for being here...

AGED ACTOR

I have been proud and privileged to

have spent my life in the Theater -

"a poor player ... that struts and

frets his hour upon the stage" -

and I have been honored to be, for

forty years, Chief Promoter of the

Sarah Siddons Society...

(he lifts the Sarah

Siddons Award from its

altar)

Thirty-nine times have I placed in

deserving hands this highest honor

the Theater knows...

(he grows a bit arch, he

uses his eyebrows)

Surely no actor is older than I - I

have earned my place out of the

sun...

(indulgent laughter)

... and never before has this Award

gone to anyone younger than its

recipient tonight. How fitting that

it should pass from my hands to

hers...

AGED ACTOR

Such young hands. Such a young

lady. Young in years, but whose

heart is as old as the Theater...

AGED ACTOR

Some of us a privileged to know

her. We have seen beyond the beauty

and artistry-

AGED ACTOR

-that have made her name resound

through the nation. We know her

humility. Her devotion, her loyalty

to her art.

AGED ACTOR

Her love, her deep and abiding love

for us-

AGED ACTOR

-for what we are and what we do.

The Theater. She has had one wish,

one prayer, one dream. To belong to

us.

(he's nearing his curtain

line)

Tonight her dream has come true.

And henceforth we shall dream the

same of her.

(a slight pause)

Honored members, ladies and

gentlemen - for distinguished

achievement in the Theater - the

Sarah Siddons Award to Miss Eve

Harrington.

ADDISON'S VOICE

Eve. Eve, the Golden Girl. The

cover girl, the girl next door, the

girl on the moon... Time has been

good to Eve, Life goes where she

goes - she's been profiled,

covered, revealed, reported, what

she eats and when and where, whom

she knows and where she was and

when and where she's going...

ADDISON'S VOICE

... Eve. You all know all about

Eve... what can there be to know

that you don't know...?

KAREN'S VOICE

When was it? How long? It seems a

lifetime ago. Lloyd always said

that in the Theater a lifetime was

a season, and a season a lifetime.

It's June now. That was - early

October... only last October. It

was a drizzly night, I remember I

asked the taxi to wait...

DISSOLVE TO:

KAREN'S VOICE

Where was she? Strange... I had

become so accustomed to seeing her

there night after night - I found

myself looking for a girl I'd never

spoken to, wondering where she

was...

EVE'S VOICE

(softly)

Mrs. Richards...

KAREN

So there you are. It seemed odd,

suddenly, your not being there...

EVE

Why should you think I wouldn't be?

KAREN

Why should you be? After all, six

nights a week - for weeks - of

watching even Margo Channing enter

and leave a theater-

EVE

I hope you don't mind my speaking

to you...

KAREN

Not at all.

EVE

I've seen you so often - it took

every bit of courage I could raise-

KAREN

(smiles)

To speak to just a playwright's

wife? I'm the lowest form of

celebrity...

EVE

You're Margo Channing's best

friend. You and your husband are

always with her - and Mr.

Sampson... what's he like?

KAREN

(grins)

Bill Sampson? He's - he's a

director.

EVE

He's the best.

KAREN

He'll agree with you. Tell me, what

do you between the time Margo goes

in and comes out? Just huddle in

that doorway and wait?

EVE

Oh, no. I see the play.

KAREN

(incredulous)

You see the play? You've seen the

play every performance?

(Eve nods)

But, don't you find it - I mean

apart from everything else - don't

you find it expensive?

EVE

Standing room doesn't cost much. I

manage.

KAREN

I'm going to take you to Margo...

EVE

(hanging back)

Oh, no...

KAREN

She's got to meet you-

EVE

No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be

just another tongue-tied gushing

fan...

KAREN

(insisting)

There isn't another like you, there

couldn't be-

EVE

But if I'd known... maybe some

other time... I mean, looking like

this.

KAREN

You look just fine...

(they're at the stage

door)

... by the way. What's your name?

EVE

Eve. Eve Harrington.

EVE

You can breathe it - can't you?

Like some magic perfume...

KAREN

(whispers)

You wait a minute...

(smiles)

... now don't run away-

MARGO'S VOICE

(loudly; through the door)

"Honey chile," I said, "if the

South had won the war, you could

write the same plays about the

North!"

KAREN

Hi.

(she goes to kiss Lloyd)

Hello, darling-

MARGO

Hi.

(she goes right on - in a

think "Suth'n" accent)

"Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't

think you can rightly say we lost

the wah, we was mo' stahved out,

you might say - an' that's what ah

don' unnerstand about all these

plays about love-stahved Suth'n

women - love is one thing we was

nevah stahved for the South!"

LLOYD

How was the concert?

KAREN

Loud.

BIRDIE

Lemme fix you a drink.

KAREN

No thanks, Birdie.

LLOYD

Margo's interview with a lady

reporter from the South-

BIRDIE

The minute it gets printed they're

gonna fire on Gettysburg all over

again...

MARGO

It was Fort Sumter they fired on-

BIRDIE

I never played Fort Sumter.

MARGO

Honey chili had a point. You know,

I can remember plays about women -

even from the South - where it

never even occurred to them whether

they wanted to marry their fathers

more than their brothers...

LLOYD

That was way back...

MARGO

Within your time, buster. Lloyd,

honey, be a playwright with guts.

Write me one about a nice, normal

woman who shoots her husband.

BIRDIE

You need new girdles.

MARGO

Buy some.

BIRDIE

The same size?

MARGO

Of course!

BIRDIE

Well. I guess a real tight girdle

help when you're playin' a lunatic.

KAREN

(firmly)

Margo does not play a lunatic,

Birdie.

BIRDIE

I know. She just keeps hearin' her

dead father play the banjo.

MARGO

It's the tight girdle that does it.

KAREN

I find these wisecracks

increasingly less funny! 'Aged in

Wood' happens to be a fine and

distinguished play-

LLOYD

- 'at's my loyal little woman.

KAREN

The critics thought so, the

audiences certainly think so -

packed houses, tickets for months

in advance - I can't see that

either of Lloyd's last two plays

have hurt you any!

LLOYD

Easy, now...

MARGO

(grins)

Relax, kid. It's only me and my big

mouth...

KAREN

(mollified)

It's just that you get me so mad

sometimes... of all the women in

the world with nothing to complain

about-

MARGO

(dryly)

Ain't it the truth?

KAREN

Yes, it is! You're talented,

famous, wealthy - people waiting

around night after night just to

see you, even in the wind and

rain...

MARGO

Autograph fiends! They're not

people - those little beast who run

in packs like coyotes-

KAREN

They're your fans, your audience-

MARGO

They're nobody's fans! They're

juvenile delinquents, mental

detectives, they're nobody's

audience, they never see a play or

a movie, even - they're never

indoors long enough!

KAREN

Well... there's one indoors now.

I've brought her back to see you.

MARGO

You've what?

KAREN

(in a whisper)

She's just outside the door.

MARGO

(to Birdie; also a

whisper)

The heave-ho.

KAREN

You can't put her out, I

promised... Margo, you've got to

see her, she worships you, it's

like something out of a book-

LLOYD

That book is out of print, Karen,

those days are gone.

Fans no longer pull the carriage

through the streets - they tear off

clothes and steal wrist watches...

KAREN

If you'd only see her, you're her

whole life - you must have spotted

her by now, she's always there...

MARGO

Kind of mousy trench coat and funny

hat?

(Karen nods)

How could I miss her? Every night

and matinee - well...

BIRDIE

Once George Jessel played my

hometown. For a girl, gettin' in to

see him was easy. Gettin' out was

the problem...

EVE

(simply)

I thought you'd forgotten about me.

KAREN

Not at all.

(her arm through Eve's)

Margo, this is Eve Harrington.

MARGO

(musically)

How do you do, my dear.

BIRDIE

(mutters)

Oh, brother.

EVE

Hello, Miss Channing.

KAREN

My husband...

LLOYD

(nicely)

Hello, Miss Harrington.

EVE

How do you do, Mr. Richards.

MARGO

(graciously)

And this is my good friend and

companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.

BIRDIE

Oh, brother.

MARGO

Miss Coonan...

LLOYD

(to Birdie)

Oh brother what?

BIRDIE

When she gets like this... all of a

sudden she's playin' Hamlet's

mother...

MARGO

(quiet menace)

I'm sure you must have things to do

in the bathroom, Birdie dear.

BIRDIE

If I haven't, I'll find something

till you're normal.

MARGO

Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down,

Miss Worthington?

KAREN

Harrington.

MARGO

I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't

you sit down?

EVE

Thank you.

MARGO

Would you like a drink? It's right

beside you...

KAREN

I was telling Margo and Lloyd about

how often you'd seen the play...

EVE

(to Margo)

No, thank you.

(to Lloyd)

Yes. I've seen every performance.

LLOYD

(delighted)

Every performance? Then - am I safe

in assuming you like it?

EVE

I'd like anything Miss Channing

played...

MARGO

(beams)

Would you, really? How sweet-

LLOYD

(flatly)

I doubt very much that you'd like

her in 'The Hairy Ape'.

EVE

Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr.

Richards. I think that part of Miss

Channing's greatness lies in her

ability to choose the best plays...

your new play is for Miss Channing,

isn't it, Mr. Richards?

MARGO

Of course it is.

LLOYD

How'd hear about it?

EVE

There was an item in the Times. i

like the title. 'Footsteps on the

Ceiling'.

LLOYD

Let's get back to this one. Have

you really seen every performance?

(Eve nods)

Why? I'm curious...

EVE

Well. If I didn't come to see the

play, I wouldn't have anywhere else

to go.

MARGO

There are other plays...

EVE

Not with you in them. Not by Mr.

Richards...

LLOYD

But you must have friends, a

family, a home-

KAREN

Tell us about it - Eve...

EVE

If I only knew how...

KAREN

Try...

EVE

Well...

EVE

Well... it started with the play

before this one...

LLOYD

'Remembrance'.

MARGO

Did you see it here in New York?

EVE

San Francisco. It was the last

week. I went one night... the most

important night in my life - until

this one. Anyway... I found myself

going the next night - and the next

and the next. Every performance.

Then, when the show went East - I

went East.

BIRDIE

I'll never forget that blizzard the

night we played Cheyenne. A cold

night. First time I ever saw a

brassiere break like a piece of

matzos...

KAREN

Eve... why don't you start at the

beginning?

EVE

It couldn't possibly interest you.

MARGO

Please...

EVE

I guess it started back home.

Wisconsin, that is. There was just

mum, and dad - and me. I was the

only child, and I made believe a

lot when I was a kid - I acted out

all sorts of things... what they

were isn't important. But somehow

acting and make-believe began to

fill up my life more and more, it

got so that I couldn't tell the

real from the unreal except that

the unreal seemed more real to

me... I'm talking a lot of

gibberish, aren't I?

LLOYD

Not at all...

EVE

Farmers were poor in those days,

that's what dad was - a farmer. I

had to help out. So I quit school

and I went to Milwaukee. I became a

secretary. In a brewery.

(she smiles)

When you're a secretary in a

brewery - it's pretty hard to make

believe you're anything else.

Everything is beer. It wasn't much

fun, but it helped at home -  and

there was a Little Theater Group...

like a drop of rain in the desert.

That's where I met Eddie. He was a

radio technician. We played

'Liliom' for three performances, I

was awful - then the war came, and

we got married. Eddie was in the

air force - and they sent him to

the South Pacific. You were with

the O.W.I., weren't you Mr.

Richards?

(Lloyd nods)

That's what 'Who's Who' says...

well, with Eddie gone, my life went

back to beer. Except for a letter a

week. One week Eddie wrote he had a

leave coming up. I'd saved my money

and vacation time. I went to San

Francisco to meet him.

(a slight pause)

Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded

the telegram from Milwaukee - the

one that came from Washington to

say that Eddie wasn't coming at

all. That Eddie was dead...

(Karen puts her hand on

Lloyd's)

... so I figured I'd stay in San

Francisco. i was alone, but

couldn't go back without Eddie. I

found a job. And his insurance

helped... and there were theaters

in San Francisco. And one night

Margo Channing came to play in

'Remembrance'... and I went to see

it. And - well - here I am...

BIRDIE

(finally)

What a story. Everything but the

bloodhounds snappin' at her rear

end...

MARGO

There are some human experiences,

Birdie, that do not take place in a

vaudeville house - and that even a

fifth-rate vaudevillian should

understand and respect!

(to Eve)

I want to apologize for Birdie's-

BIRDIE

(snaps in)

You don't have to apologize for me!

(to Eve)

I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

It's just my way of talkin'...

EVE

(nicely)

You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss

Coonan...

BIRDIE

Call me Birdie.

(to Margo)

As for bein' fifth-rate - i closed

the first half for eleven years an'

you know it!

BILL

Forty-five minutes from now my

plane takes off and how do I find

you? Not ready yet, looking like a

junk yard-

MARGO

Thank you so much.

BILL

Is it sabotage, does my career mean

nothing to you? Have you no human

consideration?

MARGO

Show me a human and I might have!

KAREN

(conscious of Eve)

Bill...

BILL

The air lines have clocks, even if

you haven't! I start shooting a

week from Monday - Zanuck is

impatient, he wants me, he needs

me!

KAREN

(louder)

Bill-

MARGO

Zanuck, Zanuck, Zanuck! What are

you two - lovers?

BILL

(smiling)

Only in some ways. You're

prettier...

MARGO

I'm a junk yard.

KAREN

(yells)

Bill!

BILL

(vaguely; to Karen)

Huh?

KAREN

This is Eve Harrington.

BILL

Hi.

(to Margo)

My wonderful junk yard. The mystery

and dreams you find in a junk yard-

MARGO

(kisses him)

Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.

BILL

Hello, what's your name?

EVE

Eve. Eve Harrington.

KAREN

You've already met.

BILL

Where?

KAREN

Right here. A minute ago.

BILL

That's nice.

MARGO

She, too, is a great admirer of

yours.

BIRDIE

Imagine. All this admiration in

just one room.

BILL

Take your mistress into the

bathroom and dress her.

(Birdie opens her mouth)

Without comment.

KAREN

You're not going, are you?

EVE

I think I'd better. It's been -

well, I can hardly find the words

to say how it's been...

MARGO

(rises)

No, don't go...

EVE

The four of you must have so much

to say to each other - with Mr.

Sampson leaving...

MARGO

Stick around. Please. Tell you what

- we'll put Stanislavsky on his

plane, you and I, then go somewhere

and talk.

EVE

Well - if I'm not in the way...

MARGO

I won't be a minute.

KAREN

Lloyd, we've got to go-

KAREN

Margo, good night! I'll call you

tomorrow!

KAREN

Good luck, genius...

BILL

Geniuses don't need good luck.

(he grins)

I do.

LLOYD

I'm not worried about you.

BILL

Keep the thought.

KAREN

Good night, Eve. I hope I see you

again soon-

EVE

I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow

matinee-

KAREN

Not just that way. As a friend...

EVE

I'd like that.

LLOYD

It's been a real pleasure, Eve.

EVE

I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good

night...

EVE

Mrs. Richards.

(Karen and Lloyd look

back)

... I'll never forget this night as

long as I live. And I'll never

forget you for making it possible.

KAREN'S VOICE

- and I'll never forget you, Eve.

Where were we going that night,

Lloyd and I? Funny the things you

remember - and the things you

don't...

EVE

You said forty-seven minutes.

You'll never make it.

BILL

(grins)

I told you a lie. We'll make it

easily. Margo's got no more

conception of time than a halibut.

BILL

She's been carrying that letter

around for weeks. I've read it

three times...

MARGO'S VOICE

You're supposed to zip the zipper -

not me.

BIRDIE'S VOICE

Like tryin' to zip a pretzel -

stand still!

BILL

What a documentary those two would

make... like the mongoose and the

cobra-

EVE

(finally)

So you're going to Hollywood.

BILL

Why?

EVE

I just wondered.

BILL

Just wondered what?

EVE

Why.

BILL

Why what?

EVE

Why you have to go out there.

BILL

I don't have to. I want to.

EVE

Is it the money?

BILL

Eighty percent of it will go for

taxes.

EVE

Then why? Why, if you're the best

and most successful young director

in the Theater-

BILL

The Theatuh, the Theatuh-

(he sits up)

- what book of rules says the

Theater exists only within some

ugly buildings crowded into one

square mile of New York City? Or

London, Paris or Vienna?

(he gets up)

Listen, junior. And learn. Want to

know what the Theater is? A flea

circus. Also opera. Also rodeos,

carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal

dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man

band - all Theater. Wherever

there's magic and make-believe and

an audience - there's Theater.

Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone

Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles

Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty

Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora

Duse. You don't understand them

all, you don't like them all, why

should you? The Theater's for

everybody - you included, but not

exclusively - so don't approve or

disapprove. It may not be your

Theater, but it's Theater of

somebody, somewhere.

EVE

I just asked a simple question.

BILL

(grins)

And I shot my mouth off. Nothing

personal, junior, no offense...

(he sits back down)

... it's just that there's so much

bushwah in this Ivory Green Room

they call the Theatuh - sometimes

it gets up around my chin...

EVE

But Hollywood. You mustn't stay

there.

BILL

(he closes his eyes)

It's only one picture deal.

EVE

So few come back...

BILL

Yeah. They keep you under drugs out

there with armed guards...

EVE

I read George Jean Nathan every

week.

BILL

Also Addison deWitt.

EVE

Every day.

BILL

You didn't have to tell me.

MARGO

(en route)

I understand it's the latest thing -

just one earring. If it isn't, it's

going to be - I can't find the

other...

BILL

Throw that dreary thing away, it

bores me-

EVE

(concerned)

Where do you suppose it could be?

BIRDIE

It'll show up.

MARGO

(gives up)

Oh well...

(to Birdie)

... look through the wigs, maybe it

got caught-

BILL

Real diamonds in a wig. The world

we live in...

MARGO

(she's been looking)

Where's my coat?

BIRDIE

Right where you left it...

BILL

(to Margo)

The seams.

MARGO

(to Eve)

Can't keep his eyes off my legs.

BILL

Like a nylon lemon peel-

MARGO

(straightens up)

Byron couldn't have said it more

graciously... here we go-

BILL

Got any messages? What do you want

me to tell Tyrone Power?

BIRDIE

Just give him my phone number, I'll

tell him myself.

BIRDIE

Kill the people.

(to Margo)

Got your key?

MARGO

(nods)

See you home...

MARGO

They have to time it so everybody

gets on at the last minute. So they

can close the doors and let you

sit.

BILL

Ah...

EVE

I have a suggestion.

(they look at her)

There's really not much time left -

I mean, you haven't had a minute

alone yet, and - well, I could take

care of everything here and meet

you at the gate with the ticket...

if you'd like.

BILL

I think we'd like very much. Sure

you won't mind?

EVE

Of course not.

BILL

She's quite a girl, that what's-her

name...

MARGO

Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that

way...

BILL

The lack of pretense, that sort of

strange directness and

understanding-

MARGO

Did she tell you about the Theater

and what it meant?

BILL

(grins)

I told her. I sounded off.

MARGO

All the religions in the world

rolled into one, and we're Gods and

Goddesses... isn't it silly,

suddenly I've developed a big

protective feeling for her - a lamb

loose in our big stone jungle...

MARGO

Take care of yourself out there...

BILL

I understand they've got the

Indians pretty well in hand...

MARGO

Bill...

BILL

Huh?

MARGO

Don't get stuck on some glamour

puss-

BILL

I'll try.

MARGO

You're not such a bargain, you

know, conceited and thoughtless and

messy-

BILL

Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.

MARGO

- you're a setup for some gorgeous

wide-eyed young babe.

BILL

How childish are you going to get

before you quit it?

MARGO

I don't want to be childish, I'd

settle for just a few years-

BILL

(firmly)

And cut that out right now.

MARGO

Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?

BILL

As of this moment you're six years

old...

EVE

All ready.

BILL

Thanks for your help... good luck.

EVE

Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.

BILL

Knit me a muffler.

MARGO

Call me when you get in...

BILL

Hey - junior...

BILL

Keep your eyes on her. Don't let

her get lonely. She's a loose lamb

in a jungle...

EVE

Don't worry...

MARGO'S VOICE

That same night we sent for Eve's

things, her few pitiful

possessions... she moved into the

little guest room on the top

floor...

MARGO'S VOICE

... she cried when she saw it - it

was so like her little room back

home in Wisconsin.

MARGO'S VOICE

... the next three weeks were out

of a fairy tale - and I was

Cinderella in the last act. Eve

became my sister, lawyer, mother,

friend, psychiatrist and cop - the

honeymoon was on...

STAGE MANAGER

One more?

MARGO

(shakes her head)

From now on it's not applause -

just something to do till the

aisles get less crowded...

MARGO

What - again?

EVE

I could watch you play that last

scene a thousand times and cry

every time-

MARGO

(grins)

Performance number one thousand of

this one - if I play it that long -

will take place in a well-padded

booby hatch...

EVE

I must say you can certainly tell

Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.

MARGO

You certainly can. Especially if

you're me between now and tomorrow

morning...

EVE

I mean the performance. Except for

you, you'd think he'd never even

directed it - it's disgraceful the

way they change everything

around...

MARGO

(smiles)

Well, teacher's away and actors

will be actors...

EVE

During your second act scene with

your father, Roger Ferraday's

supposed to stay way upstage at the

arch. He's been coming closer down

every night...

MARGO

When he gets too close, I'll spit

in his eye.

MARGO

(entering)

You bought the new girdles a size

smaller. I can feel it.

BIRDIE

Something maybe grew a size bigger.

MARGO

When we get home you're going to

get into one of those girdles and

act for two and half hours.

BIRDIE

I couldn't get into the girdle in

two an' a half hours...

EVE

You haven't noticed my latest bit

of interior decorating...

MARGO

(turns, looks)

Well, you've done so much... what's

new?

EVE

The curtains. I made them myself.

MARGO

They are lovely. Aren't they

lovely, Birdie?

BIRDIE

Adorable. We now got everything a

dressing room needs except a

basketball hoop.

MARGO

Just because you can't even work a

zipper. It was very thoughtful,

Eve, and I appreciate it-

EVE

While you're cleaning up, I'll take

this to the wardrobe mistress-

MARGO

Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be

along for it in a minute.

EVE

No trouble at all.

BIRDIE

If I may so bold as to say

something - did you ever hear the

word "union"?

MARGO

Behind in your dues? How much?

BIRDIE

I haven't got a union. I'm slave

labor.

MARGO

Well?

BIRDIE

But the wardrobe women have got

one. And next to a tenor, a

wardrobe woman is the touchiest

thing in show business-

MARGO

(catching on)

Oh-oh.

BIRDIE

She's got two things to do - carry

clothes an' press 'em wrong - an'

just let anybody else muscle in...

MARGO

(calling)

Eve-

MARGO

(quietly)

I think we'd better let Mrs. Brown

pick up the wardrobe...

MARGO

Hello..

OPERATOR'S VOICE

We are ready with your call to

Beverly Hills...

MARGO

Call, what call?

OPERATOR'S VOICE

It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo

Channing?

MARGO

That's right, but I don't

understand-

OPERATOR'S VOICE

We are ready with the call you

placed for 12 midnight, California

time, to Mr. William Sampson in

Beverly Hills...

MARGO

I placed...?

OPERATOR'S VOICE

Go ahead, please...

BILL'S VOICE

(a loud, happy squawk)

Margo! What a wonderful surprise!

BILL

(continuing)

What a thoughtful, ever-lovin'

thing to do-

MARGO

(dazed)

Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?

BILL

You're my girl, aren't you?

MARGO

That I am...

BILL

Then you're crazy.

MARGO

(nods in agreement)

When - when are you coming back?

BILL

I leave in a week - the picture's

all wrapped up, we previewed last

night... those previews. Like

opening out of town, but

terrifying. There's nothing you can

do, you're trapped, you're in a tin

can-

MARGO

- in a tin can, cellophane or

wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want

you home...

BILL

You in a hurry?

MARGO

A big hurry, be quick about it - so

good night, darling, and sleep

tight...

BILL

Wait a minute! You can't hang up,

you haven't even said it-

MARGO

Bill, you know how much I do - but

over the phone, now really, that's

kid stuff...

BILL

Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen

every day, I want to heat it - and

if you won't say it, you can sing

it...

MARGO

(convinced she's gone mad)

Sing it?

BILL

Sure! Like the Western Union boys

used to do...

MARGO

Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.

BILL

And who remembered it? Who was

there on the dot, at twelve

midnight...?

MARGO

(miserably)

Happy birthday, darling...

BILL

The reading could have been better,

but you said it - now "many happy

returns of the day..."

MARGO

(the same)

Many happy returns of the day...

BILL

I get a party, don't I?

MARGO

Of course, birthday and welcome

home... who'll I ask?

BILL

(laughs)

It's no secret, I know all about

the party - Eve wrote me...

MARGO

She did...?

BILL

She hasn't missed a week since I

left - but you know all that, you

probably tell her what to write...

anyway, I sent her a list of people

to ask - check with her.

MARGO

Yeah... I will.

BILL

How is Eve? Okay?

MARGO

Okay.

BILL

I love you...

MARGO

(mutters)

I'll check with Eve...

BILL

What?

MARGO

I love you too. Good night, darling-

BILL

See you...

MARGO

Birdie-

BIRDIE

Hmm?

MARGO

You don't like Eve, do you?

BIRDIE

Do you want an argument or an

answer?

MARGO

An answer.

BIRDIE

No.

MARGO

Why not?

BIRDIE

Now you want an argument.

MARGO

She works hard.

BIRDIE

Night an' day.

MARGO

She's loyal and efficient-

BIRDIE

Like an agent with one client.

MARGO

She thinks only for me...

(no answer from Birdie)

... doesn't she?

BIRDIE

(finally)

Well... let's say she thinks only

about you, anyway...

MARGO

How do you mean that?

BIRDIE

I'll tell you how. Like - let's see

- like she was studyin' you, like

you were a play or a book or a set

of blueprints. How you walk, talk,

think, eat, sleep-

MARGO

(breaks in; sharply)

I'm sure that's very flattering,

Birdie, and I'm sure there's

nothing wrong with that!

EVE

Good morning!

EVE

Well - what do you think of my

elegant new suit?

MARGO

Very becoming. It looks better on

you than it did on me.

EVE

(scoffs)

I can imagine... you know, all it

needed was some taking in here and

letting out there - are you sure

you won't want it yourself?

MARGO

Quite sure. I find it just a bit

too - too "Seventeenish" for me...

EVE

(laughs)

Oh, come now, as though you were an

old lady... I'm on my way. Is there

anything more you've thought of-?

MARGO

There's the script to go back to

the Guild-

EVE

I've got it.

MARGO

- and those checks or whatever it

is for the income tax man.

EVE

Right here.

MARGO

It seems I can't think of a thing

you haven't thought of...

EVE

(smile)

That's my job.

(she turns to go)

See you at tea time...

MARGO

Eve...

(Eve turns at the door)

... by any chance, did you place a

call from me to Bill for midnight

California time?

EVE

(gasps)

Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-

MARGO

Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.

EVE

Well, I was sure you'd want to, of

course, being his birthday, and

you've been so busy these past few

days, and last night I meant to

tell you before you went out with

the Richards - and I guess I was

asleep when you got home...

MARGO

Yes, I guess you were. It - it was

very thoughtful of you, Eve.

EVE

Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly

wouldn't forget that. You'd never

forgive me.

(she smiles shyly)

As a matter of fact, I sent him a

telegram myself...

KAREN'S VOICE

I saw Eve quite often after our

first meeting, but we never really

talked again - until the party

Margo gave for Bill when he

returned from Hollywood...

KAREN'S VOICE

It's always convenient at a party

to know the hostess well enough to

use her bedroom rather than go

where all the others have to go...

KAREN

Now who's show up at this hour?

It's time people went home - hold

that coat up...

(Eve holds it up; Karen

whistles)

... whose is it?

EVE

Some Hollywood movie star, her

plane got in late.

KAREN

Discouraging, isn't it? Women with

furs like that where it never gets

cold...

EVE

Hollywood.

KAREN

Tell me, Eve - how are things with

you? Happy?

EVE

There should be a new word for

happiness. Being here with Miss

Channing has been - I just can't

say, she's been so wonderful, done

so much for me-

KAREN

(smiles)

Lloyd says Margo compensates for

underplaying on the stage by

overplaying reality...

(she gets up, gets her

coat)

... next to that sable, my new mink

seems like an old bedjacket...

(throws it over her

shoulder)

... you've done your share, Eve.

You've worked wonders with Margo...

EVE

(hesitantly)

Mrs. Richards.

KAREN

(pauses, smiles)

Karen.

EVE

Karen...

(she picks at the

coverlet)

... isn't it awful, I'm about to

ask you for another favor - after

all you've already done.

KAREN

(crosses to her)

Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've

got to stop thinking of yourself as

one of the Hundred Neediest

Cases... what is it?

EVE

Well... Miss Channing's affairs are

in such good shape... there isn't

enough to keep me as busy as I

should be, really - not that I've

ever considered anything that would

take me away from her... but the

other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian

tell Miss Channing that her

understudy was going to have a

baby, and they'd have to replace

her...

KAREN

... you want to be Margo's new

understudy.

EVE

I don't let myself think about it,

even-

(she looks up, rises as

she speaks)

- but I do know the part so well,

and every bit of the staging,

there'd be no need to break in a

new girl-

(suddenly afraid, she

sits)

- but suppose I had to go on one

night? To an audience that came to

see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't

possibly...

KAREN

(laughs)

Don't worry too much about that.

Margo just doesn't miss

performances. If she can walk,

crawl or roll - she plays.

EVE

(nods proudly)

The show must go on.

KAREN

No, dear. Margo must go on.

(she sits beside Eve)

As a matter of fact, I see no

reason why you shouldn't be Margo's

understudy...

EVE

Do you think Miss Channing would

approve?

KAREN

I think she would cheer.

EVE

But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-

KAREN

They'll do as they're told.

EVE

Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian

about it?

KAREN

Of course.

EVE

You won't forget it?

KAREN

I won't forget.

EVE

I seem to be forever thanking you

for something, don't I?

BIRDIE

The bed looks like a dead animal

act. Which one is sables?

KAREN

(pointing)

But she just got here...

BIRDIE

She's on her way. With half the men

in the joint.

(she hold up the coat)

It's only a fur coat...

KAREN

What did you expect - live sables?

BIRDIE

A diamond collar, gold sleeves -

you know, picture people...

KAREN

Bill says actors out there eat just

as infrequently as here-

BIRDIE

They can always grab oranges off

trees. This you can't do in Times

Square...

ADDISON

Every now and then, some elder

statesman of the Theater or cinema

assures the public that actors and

actresses are just plain folk.

Ignoring the fact that their

greatest attraction to the public

is their complete lack of

resemblance to normal human beings.

MISS CASWELL

(as Birdie and the sables

pass)

Now there's something a girl could

make sacrifices for.

BILL'S VOICE

And probably has.

MISS CASWELL

Sable.

MAX

(to Miss Caswell)

Did you say sable - or Gable?

MISS CASWELL

Either one.

ADDISON

It is senseless to insist that

theatrical folk in New York,

Hollywood and London are no

different from the good people of

Des Moines, Chillicothe and

Liverpool. By and large, we are

concentrated gatherings of

neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional

misfits, and precocious children-

MAX

(to Bill)

Gable. Why a feller like that don't

come East to do a play...

BILL

(nods)

He must be miserable, the life he

lives out there-

ADDISON

These so-called abnormalities -

they're our stock in trade, they

make us actors, writers, directors,

et cetera in the first place-

MAX

Answer me this. What makes a man

become a producer?

ADDISON

What makes a man walk into a lion

cage with nothing but a chair?

MAX

This answer satisfies me a hundred

percent.

ADDISON

We all have abnormality in common.

We are a breed apart from the rest

of the humanity, we Theater folk.

We are the original displaced

personalities...

BILL

(laughs; to Eve)

You don't have to read his column

tomorrow - you just heard it. I

don't agree, Addison...

ADDISON

That happens to be your particular

abnormality.

BILL

Oh, I admit there's a screwball

element in the Theater. It sticks

out, it's got spotlights on it and

a brass band. But it isn't basic,

it isn't standard - if it were, the

Theater couldn't survive...

MISS CASWELL

(to a passing butler)

Oh, waiter...

ADDISON

That isn't a waiter, my dear.

That's a butler.

MISS CASWELL

Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler,"

can I? Maybe somebody's name is

Butler...

ADDISON

You have a point. An idiotic one,

but a point.

MISS CASWELL

I don't want to make trouble. All I

want is a drink.

MAX

(getting up)

Leave me get you one...

MISS CASWELL

(pitching)

Oh, thank you, Mr. Fabian.

ADDISON

Well done. I see your career rising

in the East like the sun...

(to Bill)

... you were saying?

BILL

I was saying that the Theater is

nine-tenths hard work. Work done

the hard way - by sweat,

application and craftsmanship. I'll

agree to this - that to be a good

actor, actress, or anything else in

the Theater, means wanting to be

that more than anything else in the

world...

EVE

(abruptly)

Yes. Yes, it does.

BILL

(goes on)

It means concentration of ambition,

desire, and sacrifice such as no

other profession demands... And

I'll agree that the man or woman

who accepts those terms can't be

ordinary, can't be - just someone.

To give so much for almost always

so little...

EVE

So little. So little, did you say?

Why, if there's nothing else -

there's applause. It's like - like

waves of love coming over the

footlights and wrapping you up.

Imagine...

To know, every night, that

different hundreds of people love

you... they smile, their eyes shine

- you've pleased them, they want

you, you belong. Just that alone is

worth anything...

MARGO

Don't get up. And please stop

acting as if I were the queen

mother.

EVE

(hurt)

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

BILL

(sharply)

Outside of a beehive, Margo, your

behavior would hardly be considered

either queenly or motherly!

MARGO

You're in a beehive, pal, didn't

you know? We're all busy little

bees, full of stings, making honey

day and night-

(to Eve)

- aren't we, honey?

KAREN

Margo, really...

MARGO

Please don't play governess, Karen,

I haven't your unyielding good

taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe

too but father wouldn't hear of it -

he needed help at the notions

counter...

(to Addison)

I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR

should I say "ain't I"?

ADDISON

You're maudlin and full of self

pity. You're magnificent.

LLOYD

How about calling it a night?

MARGO

And you pose as a playwright. A

situation pregnant with

possibilities - and all you can

think of is everybody to go to

sleep...

BILL

It's a good thought.

MARGO

It won't play.

KAREN

As a nonprofessional, I think it's

an excellent idea. Undramatic, but

practical...

MARGO

Happy little housewife...

BILL

Cut it out.

MARGO

This is my house, not a theater! In

my house you're a guest, not a

director-!

KAREN

Then stop being a star - start

treating your guests as your

supporting cast!

ADDISON

Hear, hear...

LLOYD

Now let's not get into a big hassle-

KAREN

It's about time we did! It's about

time Margo realized that what's

attractive on stage need not

necessarily be attractive off.

MARGO

(suddenly)

All right! I'm going to bed.

(to Bill)

You be the host. It's your party.

Happy Birthday, welcome home, and

we-who-are-about-to-die-salute-you.

BILL

Need any help?

MARGO

(pauses, smiles)

To put me to bed? Take my clothes

off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn

off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve

would. Wouldn't you, Eve?

EVE

If you'd like.

MARGO

I wouldn't like.

MAX

I forgot I had it.

MISS CASWELL

I didn't.

ADDISON

Too bad! We'll miss the third act.

They're going to play it off stage.

LLOYD

Coming?

KAREN

In a minute...

KAREN

You mustn't mind Margo too much,

even if I do...

EVE

But there must be some reason,

something I've done without

knowing...

KAREN

The reason is Margo and don't try

to figure it out. Einstein

couldn't.

EVE

If I thought I'd offended her, of

all people-

KAREN

Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I

know Margo. And every now and then

there is nothing I want to do so

much as to kick her right square in

the pants.

EVE

(smiles)

Well - if she's got to pick on

someone, I'd just as soon it was

me.

LLOYD

Max is going to drop us...

ADDISON

I've often wondered, Max, why you

bother with a chauffeur and

limousine in New York City.

MAX

In my case it's necessary. Too many

taxi drivers write plays.

ADDISON

And too many of them are produced.

MISS CASWELL

Let's go sit by the piano.

ADDISON

You have me confused with Dan

Dailey. You go sit by the piano.

(to Eve)

And you come sit by me.

(to the others)

Good night.

EVE

Karen...

(Karen pauses)

... you won't forget, will you?

What we talked about before?

KAREN

(smiles)

No, Eve, I won't forget...

MARGO'S VOICE

Bill's welcoming-home-birthday

party... a night to go down in

history. Like the Chicago Fire - or

the Massacre of the Huguenots. Even

before the party started, I could

smell disaster in the air...

MARGO'S VOICE

I knew it, I sensed it even as I

finished dressing for that blasted

party...

BIRDIE

You all put together?

MARGO

My back's open.

(Birdie goes to work on

it)

Did the extra help get here?

BIRDIE

There's some loose characters

dressed like maids and butlers.

Who'd you call - the William Morris

Agency?

MARGO

You're not being funny, I could get

actors for less. What about the

food?

BIRDIE

The caterer had to back for hors

d'oeuvres-

(she zips Margo)

Voila.

MARGO

(laughs)

That French ventriloquist taught

you a lot, didn't he?

BIRDIE

There was nothing he didn't know.

(she starts tidying the

room)

There's a message from the

bartender. Does Miss Channing know

we ordered domestic gin by mistake?

MARGO

The only thing I ordered by mistake

is the guests.

(Birdie cackles)

They're domestic, too, and they

don't care what they drink as long

as it burns... where's Bill? He's

late.

BIRDIE

Late for what?

MARGO

Don't be dense. The party.

BIRDIE

I ain't dense. And he's been here

twenty minutes.

MARGO

Well, I certainly think it's odd he

hasn't even come up...

BILL

"Don't let it worry you," said the

cameraman, "Even DeMille couldn't

see anything looking through the

wrong end-"

(Eve chuckles)

So that was the first and last time-

MARGO

Don't let me kill the point. Or

isn't it a story for grownups?

BILL

You've heard it. About when I

looked through the wrong end of a

camera finder.

MARGO

(to Eve)

Remind me to tell you about when I

looked into the heart of an

artichoke.

EVE

I'd like to hear it.

MARGO

Some snowy night in front of the

fire... in the meantime, while

we're on the subject, will you

check about the hors d'oeuvres? The

caterer forgot them, the varnish

wasn't dry or something...

EVE

Of course.

BILL

Looks like I'm going to have a very

fancy party...

MARGO

I thought you were going to be late-

BILL

When I'm guest of honor?

MARGO

I had no idea you were even here.

BILL

I ran into Eve on my way upstairs;

she told me you were dressing.

MARGO

That never stopped you before.

BILL

Well, we started talking, she

wanted to know all about Hollywood,

she seemed so interested...

MARGO

She's a girl of so many interests.

BILL

It's a pretty rare quality these

days.

MARGO

She's a girl of so many rare

qualities.

BILL

So she seems.

MARGO

(the steel begins to

flash)

So you've pointed out, so often. So

many qualities, so often. Her

loyalty, efficiency, devotion,

warmth, affection - and so young.

So young and so fair...

BILL

I can't believe you're making this

up - it sounds like something out

of an old Clyde Fitch play...

MARGO

Clyde Fitch, thought you may not

think so, was well before my time!

BILL

(laughs)

I've always denied the legend that

you were in 'Our American Cousin'

the night Lincoln was shot...

MARGO

I don't think that's funny!

BILL

Of course it's funny - this is all

too laughable to be anything else.

You know what I think about this -

this age obsession of yours - and

now this ridiculous attempt to whip

yourself up into a jealous froth

because I spent ten minutes with a

stage-struck kid-

MARGO

Twenty minutes!

BILL

Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What

of it?

MARGO

Stage-struck kid... she's a young

lady - of qualities. And I'll have

you know I'm fed up with both the

young lady and her qualities!

Studying me as if - as if I were a

play or a set of blueprints! How I

walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!

BILL

Now how can you take offense at a

kid trying in every way to be as

much like her ideal as possible!

MARGO

Stop calling her a kid! It so

happens there are particular

aspects of my life to which I would

like to maintain sole and exclusive

rights and privileges!

BILL

For instance what?

MARGO

For instance - you!

BILL

This is my cue to take you in my

arms and reassure you - but I'm not

going to. I'm too mad-

MARGO

- guilty.

BILL

Mad! Darling, there are certain

characteristics for which you are

famous - on stage and off. I love

you for some of them - and in spite

of others. I haven't let those

become too important to me. They're

part of your equipment for getting

along in what is laughably called

out environment - you've got to

keep your teeth sharp. All right.

But you will not sharpen them on me

- or on Eve...

MARGO

What about her teeth? What about

her fangs?

BILL

She hasn't cut them yet, and you

know it! So when you start judging

an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by

the barroom, Benzedrine standards

of this megalomaniac society - I

won't have it! Eve Harrington has

never by word, look, thought or

suggestion indicated anything to me

but her adoration for you and her

happiness at our being in love! And

to intimate anything else doesn't

spell jealousy to me - it spells a

paranoic insecurity that you should

be ashamed of!

MARGO

Cut! Print it! What happens in the

next reel? Do I get dragged off

screaming to the snake pit?

EVE'S VOICE

(quietly)

Miss Channing?

EVE

The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is

there anything else I can do?

MARGO

Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini -

very dry.

BILL

I'll get it.

(he crosses to Eve)

What'll you have?

MARGO

A milkshake?

EVE

A Martini. Very dry, please...

EVE

(to Karen)

May I have your coat?

KAREN

Don't bother, I can take it up

myself...

EVE

Please...

LLOYD

I like that girl. That quality of

quiet graciousness...

MARGO

... Among so many quiet qualities.

KAREN

Margo, nothing you've ever done has

made me as happy as your taking Eve

in...

MARGO

I'm so happy you're happy.

MAX

Look, you haven't been running a

settlement house exactly - the

kid's earned her way. You had a

pretty mixed-up inventory when she

took over - merchandise laying all

over the shop...

LLOYD

You've got Margo mixed up with a

five-and-ten-cent store...

MARGO

Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now

everything is on its proper shelf,

eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons.

I could die right now and nobody'd

be confused. How about you, Max?

MAX

How about me what?

MARGO

Supposed you dropped dead. What

about your inventory?

MAX

I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.

KAREN

This is the most ghoulish

conversation...

MARGO

(it drips ice)

Thank you.

BILL

Nothing, really...

MARGO

The kid - junior, that is - will be

right down. Unless you'd like to

take her drink up to her...

BILL

(smiles)

I can always get a fresh one. Karen

- you're a Gibson girl...

LLOYD

The general atmosphere is very

Macbethish. What has or is about to

happen?

MARGO

(to Bill)

What is he talking about?

BILL

Macbeth.

KAREN

(to Margo)

We know you, we've seen you before

like this. Is it over - or just

beginning?

MARGO

Fasten your seat belts. It's going

to be a bumpy night.

WOMAN #1

Margo, darling!

WOMAN #2

Darling!

MARGO

(passing)

Darlings...

MARGO

(to Addison)

I distinctly remember striking your

name from the guest list. What are

you doing here?

ADDISON

Dear Margo. You were an

unforgettable Peter Pan - you must

play it again, soon. You remember

Miss Caswell?

MARGO

I do not. How do you do?

MISS CASWELL

We never met. That's why.

ADDISON

Miss Caswell is an actress. A

graduate of Copacabana School of

Dramatic Arts.

(his glance is attracted

by Eve coming downstairs)

Ah... Eve.

EVE

(deferentially)

Good evening, Mr. deWitt.

MARGO

I had no idea you knew each other.

ADDISON

This must be, at long last, our

formal introduction. Until now we

have met only in passing...

MISS CASWELL

That's how you met me. In passing.

MARGO

(smiles)

Eve, this is an old friend of Mr.

deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell,

Miss Harrington...

(the two girls say hello)

Addison, I've been wanting you to

meet Eve for the longest time-

ADDISON

(murmurs)

It could only have been your

natural timidity that kept you from

mentioning it...

MARGO

You've heard of her great interest

in the Theater-

ADDISON

We have that in common.

MARGO

Then you two must have a long talk-

EVE

I'm afraid Mr. deWitt would find me

boring before too long.

MISS CASWELL

You won't bore him, honey. You

won't even get to talk.

ADDISON

(icily)

Claudia dear, come closer.

(she does, and he points)

This is Max Fabian. He is a

producer. Go do yourself some good.

MISS CASWELL

(sighs)

Why do they always look like

unhappy rabbits?

ADDISON

Because that is what they are. Go

make him happy.

ADDISON

(to Margo)

You mustn't worry about your little

charge. She is in safe hands.

MARGO

Amen.

MARGO

(quietly)

"Liebestraum."

PIANIST

I just played it.

MARGO

Play it again.

PIANIST

But that was the fourth straight

time.

MARGO

Then this will be five. I suppose

you think I'm too drunk to count.

PIANIST

No. You're just crazy about

"Liebestraum."

MARGO

"Liebestraum."

PIANIST

Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of

depressing. If you don't mind my

saying so, everybody's kind of

dying on the vine...

MARGO

My dear Horowitz. In the first

place, I'm paying you union scale.

Second, it's my piano. Third, if

everybody doesn't like kind of

dying on the vine, they can get off

the vine and go home.

"Liebestraum."

BILL

(whispers)

Many of your guests have been

wondering when they may be

permitted to view the body. Where

has it been laid out?

MARGO

(somberly)

It hasn't been laid out, we haven't

finished with the embalming. As a

matter of fact, you're looking at

it. The remains of Margo Channing.

Sitting up. It is my last wish to

be buried sitting up.

BILL

(trying to kid her out of

it)

Wouldn't you feel more natural

taking a bow?

MARGO

You know nothing about feelings,

natural or unnatural.

BILL

Then without feeling, your guests

were also wondering whether the

music couldn't be a shade more on

the - shall we say, happier side?

MARGO

If my guests do not like it here, I

suggest they accompany you to the

nursery where I'm sure you will all

feel more at home.

MAX

Margo. You by any chance got

bicarbonate of soda in the house?

MARGO

(sympathetic)

Poor Max. Heartburn?

(Max nods)

It's that Miss Caswell. I don't

know why she doesn't give Addison

heartburn.

BILL

No heart to burn.

MARGO

Everybody has a heart - except some

people.

(she finishes her drink,

stands up)

Of course I've got bicarb. There's

a box in the pantry. We'll put your

name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say

there. Always. Just for you.

MAX

(touched)

Let the rest of the world beat

their brains out for a buck. It's

friends that count. And I got

friends.

MARGO

I love you, Max. I really mean it.

I love you. Come to the pantry.

MAX

She loves me like a father. Also,

she's loaded.

MARGO

Here you are, Maxie dear. One good

burp and you'll be rid of that Miss

Caswell...

MAX

The situation I'm in ain't the kind

you can belch your way out. I made

a promise...

MARGO

Miss Caswell?

(Max nods)

What?

MAX

An audition for the part we're

replacing. What's-her-name, your

sister...

MARGO

Well, if she can act, she might not

be bad. She looks like she might

burn down a plantation...

MAX

(mixing)

I feel right now like there's one

burning in me.

MARGO

When's the audition?

MAX

A couple of weeks.

MARGO

I tell you what. Why don't I read

with her?

MAX

Would you?

MARGO

Anything to help you out, Max.

MAX

This is real cooperation. I

appreciate it.

MARGO

Not at all. And you could do me a

big favor, if you would-

MAX

All you got to do is name it.

MARGO

Give Eve Harrington job in you

office.

MARGO

You get quick action, don't you?

MAX

Margo, I wouldn't think of taking

that girl away from you...

MARGO

You said yourself my inventory was

in good shape - all of my

merchandise put away. To keep her

here with nothing to do - I'd be

standing in her way... and you need

her, Max.

MAX

But what could she do?

MARGO

She'd be a great help - read

scripts, interview people you have

to see, get rid of the ones you

don't have to... you'd be a man of

leisure-

MAX

Well...

MARGO

Think of your health, Max - more

time to relax out in the fresh air

at a race track...

MAX

I don't know if this would be a

wise move...

MARGO

Promise.

MAX

I promise.

MARGO

(happily)

That's my Max.

LLOYD

There you are, both of you. Max,

Karen has decided it's time to go.

MARGO

Where is she?

LLOYD

Up in the room.

MAX

If you'll excuse me-

(to Margo)

I'll tell Miss Caswell...

MARGO

Who's left out there?

LLOYD

Too many. And you've got a new

guest. A movie star from Hollywood.

MARGO

Shucks. And my autograph book is at

the cleaners.

MARGO

You disapprove of me when I'm like

this, don't you?

LLOYD

Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I

wish I understood you better.

MARGO

When you do, let me in on it.

LLOYD

I will.

MARGO

How's the new one coming?

LLOYD

The play? All right, I guess...

MARGO

"Cora." She's - still a girl of

twenty?

LLOYD

Twentyish. It isn't important.

MARGO

Don't you think it's about time it

became important?

LLOYD

How do you mean?

MARGO

Don't be evasive.

LLOYD

Margo, you haven't got any age.

MARGO

Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken

like a press agent.

LLOYD

I know what I'm talking about,

after all they're my plays...

MARGO

Spoken like an author.

(abruptly)

Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not

thirtyish. Three months ago, I was

forty years old. Forty. Four oh.

(smiles)

That slipped out, I hadn't quite

made up my mind to admit it. Now I

feel as if I'd suddenly taken all

my clothes off...

LLOYD

Week after week, to thousands of

people, you're as young as you

want...

MARGO

... as young as they want, you

mean. And I'm not interested in

whether thousands of people think

I'm six or six hundred-

LLOYD

Just one person. Isn't that so?

(Margo doesn't answer)

You know what this is all about,

don't you? It has very little to do

with whether you should play "Cora"

- it has everything to do with the

fact that you've had another fight

with Bill.

MARGO

Bill's thirty-two. He looks thirty

two. He looked it five years ago,

he'll look it twenty years from

now. I hate men.

(she puts the box down)

Don't worry, Lloyd. I'll play your

play. I'll wear rompers and come in

rolling a hoop if you like... let's

go say good night.

EVE

(in the b.g.)

Imagine... to know, every night,

that different hundreds of people

love you... They smile, their eyes

shine - you've pleased them, they

want you, you belong. Anything's

worth that.

MARGO

Don't get up. And please stop

acting as if I were the queen

mother.

MARGO'S VOICE

What was it the wise man said -

"This, too, will pass away"? Two

weeks later - the day of the

audition - all was well with Bill

and me, the world and me-

MARGO

Why so remote, Addison? I should

think you'd be at the side of your

protegee, lending her moral

support...

ADDISON

Miss Caswell, at the moment, is

where I can lend no support - moral

or otherwise.

MARGO

The ladies' - shall we say -

lounge?

ADDISON

Being violently ill to her tummy.

MARGO

It's good luck before an audition.

She'll be all right once it starts.

ADDISON

Miss Caswell got lucky too late.

The audition is over.

MARGO

(stops)

Over? It can't be. I've come to

read with her. I promised Max.

ADDISON

The audition was called for 2:30.

It is now nearly four.

MARGO

(lightly)

Is it really? I must start wearing

a watch, I never do, you know...

who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?

(he shakes his head)

Lloyd?

(he shakes his head)

Well, it couldn't have been Max!

Who?

ADDISON

Naturally enough, your understudy.

MARGO

I consider it highly unnatural to

allow a girl in an advanced state

of pregnancy-

ADDISON

I refer to your new and unpregnant

understudy. Eve Harrington.

MARGO

Eve! My understudy...

ADDISON

(keenly)

Didn't you know?

MARGO

(quickly)

Of course I knew.

ADDISON

It just slipped your mind.

MARGO

How... how was Miss Caswell?

ADDISON

Frankly, I don't remember.

MARGO

Just slipped your mind.

ADDISON

Completely. Nor, I am sure, could

anyone else present tell you how

Miss Caswell read or whether Miss

Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.

MARGO

Was she that bad?

ADDISON

Margo, as you know, i have lived in

the Theater as a Trappist monk

lives in his faith. I have no other

world, no other life - and once in

a great while I experience that

moment of Revelation for which all

true believers wait and pray. You

were one. Jeanne Eagels another...

Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are

others, three or four. Eve

Harrington will be among them...

MARGO

(flatly)

I take it she read well.

ADDISON

It wasn't reading, it was a

performance. Brilliant, vivid,

something made of music and fire...

MARGO

How nice.

ADDISON

In time she'll be what you are.

MARGO

A mass of music and fire. That's

me. An old kazoo and some sparkles.

Tell me - was Bill swept away, too,

or were you too full of Revelation

to notice?

ADDISON

Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was

beside himself. He listened to his

play as if someone else had written

it, he said, it sounded so fresh,

so new, so full of meaning...

MARGO

How nice for Lloyd. And how nice

for Eve. How nice for everybody.

ADDISON

Eve was incredibly modest. She

insisted that no credit was due

her, that Lloyd felt as he did only

because she read lines exactly as

he had written them.

MARGO

The implication being that I have

not been reading them as written.

ADDISON

To the best of my recollection,

neither your name nor your

performance entered the

conversation.

ADDISON

Feeling better, my dear?

MISS CASWELL

Like I just swam the English

Channel. Now what?

ADDISON

You next move, it seems to me,

should be toward television.

MISS CASWELL

Tell me this. Do they have

auditions for television?

ADDISON

That's all television is, my dear.

Nothing but auditions.

MARGO

(cheerily)

Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was

long and I couldn't find a cab -

where's Miss Caswell, shall we

start? Oh, hello, Eve...

EVE

Hello, Miss Channing.

MARGO

How are you making out in Mr.

Fabian's office?

(over the footlights to

Max)

I don't want you working the child

too hard, Max - just because you

promised. As you see, I kept my

promise, too...

BILL

It's all over.

MARGO

What's all over?

BILL

The audition.

MARGO

(pleased astonishment)

Eve?

(she turns to her)

How enchanting...

(to Lloyd and Bill)

Wherever did you get the idea of

having Eve read with Miss Caswell?

LLOYD

She's your understudy.

MARGO

Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had

no idea...

LLOYD

I thought you knew... She was put

on over a week ago-

MARGO

It seems almost inconceivable that

I haven't seen her backstage, but

with so many people loitering

around... well, well. So Eve is not

working for Max after all-

(out to Max again)

- Max you sly puss.

EVE

Miss Channing, I can't tell you how

glad I am that you arrived so late.

MARGO

Really, Eve? Why?

EVE

Well, if you'd been here to begin

with, I wouldn't have dared to read

at all...

MARGO

Why not?

EVE

... and if you'd come in the

middle, I'd have stopped, I

couldn't have gone on-

MARGO

(murmurs)

What a pity, all that fire and

music being turned off...

BILL

What fire and music?

MARGO

You wouldn't understand.

(to Lloyd)

How was Miss Caswell?

LLOYD

Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo,

let me tell you about Eve-

EVE

(breaking in)

I was dreadful, Miss Channing,

believe me - I have no right to be

anyone's understudy, much less

yours...

MARGO

I'm sure you underestimate

yourself, Eve. You always do.

(to Lloyd)

You were about to tell me about

Eve...

LLOYD

You'd have been proud of her.

MARGO

I'm sure.

LLOYD

She was a revelation...

MARGO

To you, too?

LLOYD

What do you mean?

MARGO

(the ice begins to form)

I mean, among other things, that it

must have been a revelation to have

your twenty-four-year-old character

played by twenty-four-year-old

actress...

LLOYD

That's beside the point.

MARGO

It's right to the point. Also that

it must have sounded so new and

fresh to you - so exciting to have

the lines read as you wrote them!

BILL

Addison-!

MARGO

So full of meaning, fire and music!

LLOYD

You've been talking to that

venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-

MARGO

- in this case, apparently, as

trustworthy as the World Almanac!

LLOYD

You knew when you came in that the

audition was over, that Eve was

your understudy! Playing that

childish game of cat and mouse...

MARGO

Not mouse, never mouse! If anything

- rat!

LLOYD

You have a genius for making

barroom brawl out of a perfectly

innocent misunderstanding at most!

MARGO

Perfectly innocent! Man have been

hanged for less! I'm lied to,

attacked behind my back, accused of

reading your silly dialogue

inaccurately - as if it were Holy

Gospel!

LLOYD

I never said it was!

MARGO

Then you listened as if someone

else had written you play - whom

did you have in mind? Sherwood?

Arthur Miller? Beaumont and

Fletcher?

MAX

(from below)

May I say a word?

LLOYD

No!

(to Margo)

What makes you think that either

Miller or Sherwood would stand for

the nonsense I take from you -

you'd better stick to Beaumont and

Fletcher! They've been dead for

three hundred years!

MARGO

And they're getting better

performances today than they ever

got! All playwrights should be dead

for three hundred years!

LLOYD

That would solve none of their

problems - because actresses never

die! The stars never die and never

change!

MARGO

You can change this star any time

you want! For a new, fresh,

exciting one fully equipped with

fire and music! Any time you want -

starting with tonight's

performance!

MAX

This is for lawyers to talk about,

this concerns a run-of-the-play

contract, and this you can't

rewrite or ad lib!

MARGO

(from the stage)

Are you threatening me with legal

action, Mr. Fabian?

MAX

Are you breaking the contract?

MARGO

Answer my question!

MAX

Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying

man.

MARGO

I didn't hear you.

MAX

(yelling)

I said I'm a dying man!

MARGO

Not until the last drugstore has

sold its last pill!

LLOYD

(from the top of the

aisle)

I shall never understand the weird

process by which a body with a

voice suddenly fancies itself a

mind! Just when exactly does an

actress decide they're her words

she's saying and her thoughts she's

expressing?

MARGO

Usually at the point when she's got

to rewrite and rethink them to keep

the audience from leaving the

theater!

LLOYD

It's about time the piano realized

it has not written the concerto!

MARGO

(quiet menace)

And you, I take it, are the

Paderewski who plays his concerto

on me, the piano?

(Bill waves his cigarette;

he's noncommittal)

Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?

BILL

Who?

MARGO

The kid. Junior.

BILL

(looks lazily)

Gone.

MARGO

I must have frightened her away.

BILL

I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes

you frighten me.

MARGO

(paces up and down)

Poor little flower. Just dropped

her petals and folded her tent...

BILL

Don't mix your metaphors.

MARGO

I mix what I like.

BILL

Okay. Mix.

MARGO

I'm nothing but a body with a

voice. No mind.

BILL

What a body, what a voice.

MARGO

The ex-ship news' reporter. No

body, no voice, all mind!

BILL

The gong rang. The fight's over.

Calm down.

MARGO

I will not calm down!

BILL

Don't calm down.

MARGO

You're being terribly tolerant,

aren't you?

BILL

I'm trying terribly hard.

MARGO

Well, you needn't. I will not be

tolerated. And I will not be

plotted against!

BILL

Here we go...

MARGO

Such nonsense, what do you all take

me for - little Nell from the

country? Been my understudy for

over a week without my knowing,

carefully hidden no doubt-

BILL

(sits up)

Now don't get carried away-

MARGO

(going right on)

- shows up for an audition when

everyone knew I'd be here... and

gives a performance! Out of nowhere

- gives a performance!

BILL

You've been all through that with

Lloyd-

MARGO

The playwright doesn't make the

performance - and it doesn't just

happen! And this one didn't - full

of fire and music and whatnot, it

was carefully rehearsed I have no

doubt, over and over, full of those

Bill Sampson touches!

BILL

I am sick and tired of these

paranoiac outbursts!

MARGO

Paranoiac!

BILL

I didn't know Eve Harrington was

your understudy until half past two

this afternoon!

MARGO

Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with

the rest of it...

BILL

No, I'll tell it to you! For the

last time, I'll tell it to you.

Because you've got to stop hurting

yourself, and me, and the two of us

by these paranoiac tantrums!

MARGO

(struggling)

That word again! I don't even know

what it means...

BILL

(firmly)

It's time you found out. I love

you.

(Margo says "Ha!")

I love you. You're a beautiful and

intelligent woman-

(Margo says "A body with a

voice")

- a beautiful and intelligent woman

and a great actress-

(he waits; Margo says

nothing)

- at the peak of her career. You

have every reason for happiness-

(Margo says "Except

happiness")

- every reason, but due to some

strange, uncontrollable,

unconscious drive you permit the

slightest action of a kid-

(Margo sneers "Kid!")

- kid like Eve to turn you into a

hysterical, screaming harpy! Now

once and for all, stop it!

MARGO

It's obvious you're not a woman.

BILL

I've been aware of that for some

time.

MARGO

Well, I am.

BILL

I'll say.

MARGO

Don't be condescending.

BILL

Come on, get up. I'll buy you a

drink.

MARGO

(with dignity)

I admit I may have seen better

days, but I am still not to be had

for the price of a cocktail - like

a salted peanut.

BILL

(laughs)

Margo, let's make peace.

MARGO

The terms are too high.

Unconditional surrender.

BILL

Just being happy? Just stopping all

this nonsense about Eve - and Eve

and me?

MARGO

It's not nonsense.

BILL

But if I tell you it is - as I just

did. Were you listening to me?

(Margo nods)

Isn't that enough?

MARGO

I wish it were.

BILL

Then what would be enough?

(Margo doesn't answer)

If we were married?

MARGO

I wouldn't want you to marry me

just to prove something.

BILL

You've had so many reasons for not

wanting to marry me... Margo, tell

me what's behind all this.

MARGO

I - I don't know, Bill. Just a

feeling, I don't know...

BILL

I think you do know but you won't

or can't tell me.

(Margo doesn't say)

I said before it was going to be my

last try, and I meant it. I can't

think of anything else to do. I

wish I could.

(a pause)

We usually wind up screaming and

throwing things as the curtain

comes down. Then it comes up again

and everything's fine. But not this

time.

(he takes a breath)

You know there isn't a playwright

in the world who could make me

believe this would happen between

two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.

MARGO

Bill...

(he stops)

... where are you going? To find

Eve?

BILL

(smiles grimly)

That suddenly makes the whole thing

believable.

KAREN'S VOICE

On the day of the audition, my

biggest worry was to keep a banana

looking part of an eggplant... then

Lloyd came home.

(in the b.g., Lloyd lets

himself in)

It was right after his brawl with

Margo...

KAREN

Lloyd, what happened...?

LLOYD

Up to here! That's where I've got

it - up to here! Of all the star

ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-

KAREN

Margo, again...

LLOYD

And again and again! Two hours late

for the audition, to begin with-

KAREN

That's on time for Margo.

LLOYD

Then a childish, heavy-handed

routine about not knowing Eve was

her understudy-

KAREN

It's just possible she didn't...

LLOYD

Of course she knew! For one thing,

Addison told her how superbly Eve

had read the part-!

(suddenly softening)

Karen, let me tell you about Eve.

She's got everything - a born

actress. Sensitive, understanding,

young, exciting, vibrant-

KAREN

- don't run out of adjectives,

dear.

LLOYD

- everything a playwright first

thinks of wanting to write about...

until his play becomes a vehicle

for Miss Channing...

KAREN

Margo hasn't done badly by it.

LLOYD

Margo. Margo's great. She knows it.

That's the trouble.

She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she

wants, and who's to stop her? Who's

to give her that boot in the rear

she needs and deserves?

KAREN

(murmurs)

It's going to be a cozy weekend.

LLOYD

(pauses)

What is?

KAREN

We're driving out to the country

tomorrow night. Just the four of

us. Bill, Margo, you and I...

LLOYD

Well. We've spent weekends before

with nobody talking...

(continues up stairs)

... just be sure to lock up all

blunt instruments and throwable

objects...

KAREN'S VOICE

Newton - they say, thought of

gravity by getting hit on the head

by an apple. And the man who

invented the steam engine, he was

watching a tea-kettle... but not

me. My Big Idea came to me just

sitting on a couch...

KAREN'S VOICE

That boot in the rear to Margo.

Heaven knows she had one coming.

From me, from Lloyd, from Eve,

Bill, Max, and so on - we'd all

felt those size fives of hers often

enough... but how? The answer was

buzzing around me like a fly...

KAREN'S VOICE

I had it. But I let it go.

Screaming and calling names is one

thing - but this could mean...

KAREN'S VOICE

Why not? Why, I said to myself,

not? It would all seem perfectly

legitimate. And there were only two

people in the world who would know.

Also, the boot would land where it

would do the most good for all

concerned-

KAREN'S VOICE

And after all, it was not more than

a perfectly harmless joke which

Margo, herself, would be the first

to enjoy...

KAREN'S VOICE

... and no reason why she shouldn't

be told about it - in time.

KAREN

(into phone)

Hello... will you call Miss Eve

Harrington to the phone, please?

Not at all... thank you.

DISSOLVE TO:

KAREN'S VOICE

It was a cold weekend - outside and

in. Bill didn't come at all.

Margo didn't know where he was and

didn't care - she kept saying.

Somehow we staggered through Sunday

- and by the time we drive Margo to

the station late Monday afternoon,

she and Lloyd had thawed out to the

extent of being civil to each

other...

KAREN

What time is it?

LLOYD

When you asked a minute ago it was

five-forty-two. It is now five

forty-three. When you ask a minute

from no, it will be-

KAREN

I just don't want Margo to miss her

train. As it is, she'll barely make

the theater...

LLOYD

Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the

station in plenty of time...

MARGO

That little place just two hours

form New York. It's on my list of

things-I'll-never-understand. Like

collecting shrunken Indian heads...

KAREN

Of all people you should know what

it means to want some peace and

quiet-

MARGO

Peace and quit is for libraries.

KAREN

Lloyd, be careful...

LLOYD

Just a little skid, that's all.

This road's like glass.

MARGO

Karen and I just don't want an

accident-

LLOYD

I have no intention of having an

accident!

MARGO

It's not important whether you do.

We are wearing long underwear.

LLOYD

Now what's this...?

LLOYD

But it can't be! We can't be out of

gas! I filled it myself yesterday!

(to Karen)

Wasn't it full when you drove to

Brewster this morning?

KAREN

(very low)

I guess I didn't look. You know I

don't pay attention to those

things...

LLOYD

Incredible.

MARGO

(crisply)

How much time have we?

KAREN

Roughly ten minutes.

MARGO

How far to the station?

KAREN

Three or four miles...

MARGO

Any houses or farms around where we

can borrow gas?

KAREN

(looking)

None in sight, there aren't many

along this back road...

MARGO

Not many car either, not much

chance of a lift...

LLOYD

Well. No sense my just sitting

here. I'm going to walk up about

half a mile, just in case.

KAREN

You'll break your neck on that ice.

LLOYD

(grins)

What a way to die - trying to get

an actress to the theater in time.

Tell Max I want to be buried with

royalties...

KAREN

Don't joke about such things.

MARGO

(quietly)

How fortunate that I have an

understudy so ready, so willing and

so able to go on.

LLOYD

The audience will want its money

refunded, believe me.

MARGO

Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.

KAREN

He always looks so pathetic

whenever he does anything physical-

MARGO

It seems to me that walking, for

most people, is not very dangerous.

KAREN

(smiles)

I just never think of Lloyd as

anywhere but indoors and anything

but sitting down.

MARGO

Be brave. He'll come back - with or

without gas.

MARGO

Do you want it on?

KAREN

It doesn't matter.

MARGO

I detest cheap sentiment.

MARGO

Karen.

(Karen says "hm?")

I haven't been pleasant this

weekend.

KAREN

We've all seemed a little tense

lately...

MARGO

Come to think of it, I haven't been

very pleasant for weeks. For that,

I'm truly sorry. More than any two

people I know, I don't want you and

Lloyd to be angry with me...

KAREN

We're never deeply angry, we just

get sore. The way you do. We know

you too well...

MARGO

So many people - know me. I wish I

did. I wish someone would tell be

about me...

KAREN

You're Margo. Just - Margo.

MARGO

And what is that? Besides something

spelled out in light bulbs, I mean.

Besides something called

temperament, which consists mostly

of swooping about on a broomstick

creaming at the top of my voice...

infants behave the way I do, you

know. They carry on and misbehave -

they'd get drunk if they knew how -

when they can't have what they

want. When they feel unwanted and

insecure - or unloved.

KAREN

What about Bill?

MARGO

What about Bill?

KAREN

He's in love with you.

MARGO

More than anything in this world, I

love Bill. And I want Bill. I want

him to want me. But me. Not Margo

Channing. And if I can't tell they

apart - how can he?

KAREN

Why should he - and why should you?

MARGO

Bill's in love with Margo Channing.

He's fought with her, worked with

her, loved her... but ten years

from now - Margo Channing will have

ceased to exist. And what's left

will be... what?

KAREN

Margo. Bill is all of eight years

younger than you.

MARGO

Those years stretch as the years go

on. I've seen it happen too often.

KAREN

Not to you. Not to Bill.

MARGO

Isn't that what they always say?

MARGO

I don't suppose the heater runs

when the motor doesn't?

KAREN

Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd

fix it so people could just sit in

a car and keep warm...

MARGO

About Eve. I've acted pretty

disgracefully toward her, too.

KAREN

Well...

MARGO

Let's not fumble for excuses, not

here and now with my hair down. At

best, let's say I've been

oversensitive to... well, to the

fact that she's so young - so

feminine and helpless. To so many

things I want to be for Bill...

funny business, a woman's career.

The things you drop on your way up

the ladder, so you can move faster.

You forget you'll need them again

when you go back to being a woman.

That's one career all females have

in common - whether we like it or

not - being a woman.

Sooner or later we've all got to

work at it, no matter what other

careers we've had or wanted... and,

in the last analysis, nothing is

any good unless you can look up

just before dinner or turns around

in bed - and there he is. Without

that, you're not woman. You're

something with a French provincial

office or a book full of clippings -

but you're not a woman...

(she smiles at Karen)

... slow curtain. The end.

KAREN

Margo.

(she hesitates)

Margo, I want you to know how sorry

I am about this...

MARGO

About what?

KAREN

(indicating their

predicament)

This. I can't tell you how sorry I

am!

MARGO

Don't give it another thought, one

of destiny's many pranks. After

all, you didn't personally drain

the gasoline out of the tank...

ADDISON'S VOICE

Eve, of course, was superb. Many of

the audience understandably

preferred to return another time to

see Margo.

But those who remained cheered

loudly, lustily and long for Eve...

how thoughtful of her to call and

invite me - that afternoon...

ADDISON'S VOICE

... and what a happy coincidence

that several representatives of

other newspapers happened to be

present. All of us - invited that

afternoon to attend an understudy's

performance...

ADDISON'S VOICE

... about which the management knew

nothing until they were forced to

ring up the curtain at nine

o'clock. Coincidence. Also every

indication of intrigue, skulduggery

and fraud...

BILL

(from within)

... you were better than all right,

kid, you gave a performance, you

rang a bell-

BILL

(continuing)

- little things here and there, it

doesn't matter. You can be proud of

yourself, you've got a right to be.

EVE

(quietly)

Are you proud of me, Bill?

BILL

I'll admit I was worried when Max

called. I had my doubts.

EVE

You shouldn't have had any doubts.

BILL

- after all, the other day was one

scene, the woods are full of one

scene sensations. But you did it.

With work and patience, you'll be a

fine actress. If that's what you

want to be.

EVE

Is that what you want me to be?

BILL

I'm talking about you. And what you

want.

EVE

So am I.

BILL

What have I got to do with it?

EVE

Everything.

BILL

(lightly)

The names I've been called. But

never Svengali.

(he pats her shoulder)

Good luck.

EVE

Don't run away, Bill.

BILL

(stops)

From what would I be running?

EVE

You're always after truth - on the

stage. What about off?

BILL

(curiously)

I'm for it.

EVE

Then face it. I have. Since that

first night - here - in the

dressing room.

BILL

(smiles)

When I told you what every young

actress should know.

EVE

When you told me that whatever I

became, it would be because of you-

BILL

Your make-up's a little heavy.

EVE

- and for you.

BILL

(slowly)

You're quite a girl.

EVE

You think?

BILL

I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you

heard?

EVE

You hear all kinds of things.

BILL

I'm only human, rumors to the

contrary. And I'm as curious as the

next man...

EVE

Find out.

BILL

(deliberately)

Only thing, what I go after, I want

to go after. I don't want it to

come after me.

BILL

Don't cry. Just score it as an

incomplete forward pass.

ADDISON

May I come in?

EVE

Certainly, Mr. deWitt...

ADDISON

(entering)

I expected to find this little room

overcrowded, with a theater full of

people at your feet...

EVE

I consider myself lucky they didn't

throw things.

ADDISON

Of course your performance was no

surprise to me. After the other day

I regarded it as no more than - a

promised fulfilled.

EVE

You're more than kind. But it's

still Miss Channing's performance.

I'm just a carbon copy you read

when you can't find the original...

ADDISON

You're more than modest.

EVE

It's not modesty. I just don't try

to kid myself.

ADDISON

A revolutionary approach to the

Theater. However, if I may a

suggestion...

EVE

Please do.

ADDISON

I think the time has come for you

to shed some of your humility. It

is just as false not to blow your

horn at all as it is to blow it too

loudly...

EVE

I don't think I've done anything to

sound off about.

ADDISON

We all come into this world with

our little egos equipped with

individual horns. If we don't blow

them - who will?

EVE

Even so. One isolated pretty good

performance by an understudy. It'll

be forgotten tomorrow.

ADDISON

It needn't be.

EVE

Even if I wanted to - as you say -

be less humble, blow my own horn...

how would I do it? I'm less than

nobody.

ADDISON

I am somebody.

EVE

You certainly are.

ADDISON

Leave the door open a bit, so we

can talk.

ADDISON

After you change, if you're not

busy elsewhere, we can have supper.

EVE

(from the bathroom)

I'd love to! Or should I pretend

I'm busy?

ADDISON

(smiling)

Let's have a minimum of pretending.

I'll want to do a column about you-

EVE

I'm not enough for a paragraph.

ADDISON

- perhaps more than one. There's so

much I want to know. I've heard

your story in bits and pieces...

your home in Wisconsin, your tragic

marriage, your financial attachment

to Margo - it started in San

Francisco, didn't it?

(no answer; Addison

smiles)

I say - your idolatry of Margo

started in San Francisco, didn't

it?

EVE

That's right.

ADDISON

San Francisco. An oasis of

civilization in the California

desert. Tell me, do you share my

high opinion of San Francisco?

EVE

Yes. I do.

ADDISON

And that memorable night when Margo

first dazzled you from the stage -

which theater was it in San

Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?

EVE

(a slight pause)

Yes. The Shubert.

ADDISON

(grins happily)

A fine old theater, the Shubert.

Full of tradition, untouched by the

earthquake - so sorry - fire... by

the way, what was your husband's

name?

EVE

Eddie...

ADDISON

Eddie what?

EVE

I'm about to go into the shower, I

won't be able to hear you...

ADDISON

I can wait. Where would you like to

go? We'll make this a special

night...

EVE

(trustingly)

You take charge.

ADDISON

I believe I will.

KAREN'S VOICE

Some of the morning papers carried

a little squib about Eve's

performance. Not much, but full

praise...

I couldn't imagine how they found

out about it - but Lloyd said Max's

publicity man probably sent out the

story...

KAREN'S VOICE

... at any rate, I feel terribly

guilty and ashamed of myself - and

wanted nothing so much as to forget

the whole thing. Margo and I were

having lunch at "21" - just like

girlfriends - with hats on...

KAREN

Has Miss Channing come in?

DOORMAN

Not yet, Mrs. Richards...

KAREN

Eve. I've heard the most wonderful

things about your performance-

EVE

Mostly relief that I managed to

stagger through it at all...

ADDISON

She was magnificent.

KAREN

(pleased)

Then you've heard too.

ADDISON

I was there. An eyewitness.

KAREN

(staggered)

You were there? At the play - last

night?

ADDISON

(smiles)

A happy coincidence.

EVE

(quickly)

We're having lunch with a movie

talent scout.

KAREN

They certainly don't waste much

time.

EVE

Nothing definite yet - it's just to

have lunch.

ADDISON

They'll be wasting this much of

their time at any rate. Eve has no

intention of going to Hollywood.

ADDISON

From the smartness of your dress, I

take it your luncheon companion is

a lady?

KAREN

(smiles)

Margo.

ADDISON

Margo? Lunching in public?

KAREN

It's new Margo. But she's just as

late as the old one.

ADDISON

She may be later than you think...

ADDISON

(handing it to her)

Why not read my column to pass the

time? The minutes will fly like

hours...

(he takes Eve's arm)

... and now we must join our

sunburned eager beaver.

MARGO

(declaiming)

"... my hat which has, lo, these

many seasons become more firmly

rooted about my ears, is lifted to

Miss Harrington. I am once more

available for dancing in the

streets and shouting from the

housetops." ... I thought that one

went out with Woollcott...

(she skips part of the

column)

Down here... here, listen to this-

"... Miss Harrington had much to

tell - and these columns shall

report her faithfully - about the

lamentable practice in our Theater

of permitting, shall we say -

mature - actresses to continue

playing roles requiring a youth and

vigor of which they retain but a

dim memory-"

KAREN

I just can't believe it.

MARGO

It get better! "- About the

understandable reluctance on the

part of our entrenched First Ladies

of the Stage to encourage, shall we

say - younger - actresses; about

Miss Harrington's own long and

unsupported struggle for

opportunity-"

KAREN

I can't believe Eve said those

things!

MARGO

(pacing)

In this rat race, everybody's

guilty till they're proved

innocent! One of the differences

between the Theater and

civilization...

(she hurls the paper away)

... what gets me is how all of

those papers in town happened to

catch that particular performance!

KAREN

(weakly)

Lloyd says it's a publicity

release...

MARGO

The little witch must have had

Indians runners out snatching

critics out of bars, steam rooms

and museums or wherever they hole

up... well, she won't get away with

it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his

poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer

can't or won't do anything about

it, I will personally stuff that

pathetic little lost lamb down Mr.

deWitt's ugly throat...

BILL

(quietly)

I came as soon as I read that piece

of filth. I ran all the way...

BILL

Bill's here, baby. Everything's all

right, now...

KAREN

I guess at this point I'm what the

French call 'de trop'...

BILL

(smiles)

Maybe just a little around the

edges.

LLOYD

(is saying)

- it's Addison, from start to

finish, it drips with his brand of

venom... taking advantage of a kid

like that, twisting her words,

making her say what he wanted her

to say-

KAREN

Where'd you get all that

information?

LLOYD

(put out his cigarette)

Eve.

KAREN

Eve?

LLOYD

She's been to see me, as a matter

of fact she left just before you

came in - you just missed her...

KAREN

That was a pity...

LLOYD

(gets up)

She wanted to explain about her

interview, wanted to apologize to

someone - and didn't dare face

Margo...

KAREN

I wonder why.

LLOYD

She started to tell me all about it

- and she couldn't finish, she

cried so...

LLOYD

(finally)

You know, I've been going over our

financial condition - if you'll

pardon the expression...

KAREN

That's quite a change of subject.

LLOYD

(walks again)

What with taxes coming up - and

since I'm a playwright and not an

oil well operator - well, I've been

thinking...

KAREN

I'm trying hard to follow you.

LLOYD

If - instead of waiting until next

season to do 'Footsteps on the

Ceiling', which is in pretty good

shape - and if Margo can be talked

into going on tour with 'Aged in

Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...'

into production right away...

KAREN

I'm beginning to catch up.

LLOYD

If we could cast it properly, that

is...

KAREN

(carefully)

Maybe get some younger actress for

the part? Someone who'd look the

part as well as play it?

LLOYD

(smiles)

You've got to admit it would be a

novelty.

KAREN

Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.

LLOYD

Eve did mention the play, you know.

But just in passing - she's never

ask to play a part like "Cora,"

she'd never have the nerve...

KAREN

Eve would ask Abbott to give her

Costello.

LLOYD

No, I got the idea myself - while

she was talking to me...

KAREN

With gestures, of course.

LLOYD

(wistfully)

For once, to write something and

have it realized completely. For

once, not to compromise-

KAREN

Lloyd Richards, you are not to

consider giving that contemptible

little worm the part of "Cora."

LLOYD

Now just a minute-

KAREN

Margo Channing has not been exactly

a compromise all these years, half

the playwrights in the world would

give their shirts for that

particular compromise!

LLOYD

(angry)

Now just a minute!

KAREN

It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty

and ingratitude must be contagious!

LLOYD

All this fuss and hysteria because

an impulsive kid got carried away

by excitement and the conniving of

a professional manure slinger named

deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?

KAREN

On her knees, I have no doubt! Very

touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic

Arts!

LLOYD

That bitter cynicism of yours is

something you've acquired since you

left Radcliffe!

KAREN

The cynicism you refer to, I

acquired the day I discovered I was

different from little boys!

LLOYD

Hello!

(he quiets down)

... hi, Margo... no, not at all,

Karen and I were just chatting...

hmm?... why - why, yes, I'm sure we

can and I'm sure we'd love to...

right... 11:45ish. See you then...

LLOYD

Margo - and Bill - want us to meet

them at the Cub Room tonight, after

theater. For a bottle of wine.

KAREN

(smiles)

Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't

be more surprised if she'd said

Grant's Tomb.

LLOYD

I'm glad Bill's back.

KAREN

They'd die without each other.

LLOYD

Darling, I didn't promise Eve

anything. Just said I thought she'd

be fine for the part, but there

were some practical difficulties...

KAREN

Such as?

LLOYD

(grins)

You - for one. I told her you were

set on Margo playing the part - and

I certainly wouldn't make a change

without your approval.

KAREN

That's fine. Fine and dandy. I'd

enjoy nothing more. Just refer all

of Miss Harrington's future

requests to me...

BILL

The so-called art of acting is not

one for which I have a particularly

high regard...

MARGO

Hear, hear...

BILL

But you may quote me as follows.

Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing

gave a performance in your

cockamamie play, the like of which

I have never seen before and expect

rarely to see again. Unquote.

MARGO

He does not exaggerate. I was good.

BILL

You were great.

LLOYD

It's been quite a night. I

understand that your understudy -

Miss Harrington - has given her

notice.

MARGO

(eyes still on Bill)

Too bad.

BILL

(eyes still on Margo)

I'm broken up about it...

LLOYD

For some reason you can't just pick

up champagne and drink it.

Somebody's got to be very witty

about a toast.

(he lifts his glass)

For instance...

BILL

(abruptly)

I'm going to propose the toast.

Without wit. With all my heart.

BILL

To Margo. To my bride-to-be.

MARGO

Glory Hallelujah.

LLOYD

Well of all-

KAREN

Margo!

BILL

Drink.

KAREN

When? When are you going to do it?

BILL

Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at

ten-

(to Margo)

- and you're going to be on time.

MARGO

Yes, sir.

LLOYD

City Hall, that's for prize

fighters, and reporters - I see a

cathedral, a bishop, banks of

flowers...

BILL

It's only for the license. There's

a three-day wait - blood tests,

things like that...

MARGO

I'll marry you if it turns out you

have no blood at all.

LLOYD

Three days, that's for the

bourgeois - I see a midnight

elopement, waking up a village

person...

KAREN

(to Margo)

What are you going to wear?

MARGO

Something simple. A fur coat over a

nightgown...

BILL

The point is - in the cathedral, a

ball park or a penny arcade - we

want to have you two beside us our

nearest and dearest friends.

LLOYD

There are very few moments in life

as good as this. Let's remember it.

(he lifts his glass)

To each of us and all of us...

never have we been more close - may

we never be farther apart.

WAITER

Mrs. Richards?

KAREN

Yes?

WAITER

For you.

LLOYD

Very discreet. A note right out in

the open like that. Next time tell

your lover to blow smoke rings - or

tap a glass...

MARGO

Lloyd, I want you to be big about

this... the world is full of love

tonight, no woman is safe...

KAREN

(angrily)

This beats all world's records for

running, standing and jumping gall!

MARGO

(reading)

"Please forgive me for butting into

what seems such a happy occasion -

but it's most important that I

speak with you. Please" - it's

underlined - "meet me in the

Ladies' Room. Eve."

BILL

I understand she is now the

understudy in there.

MARGO

(looking about)

Pass me the empty bottle. I may

find her... why, look. There's

Rasputin.

MARGO

Encore du champagne.

CAPTAIN

More champagne, Miss Channing?

MARGO

That's what I said, bub.

LLOYD

(to Karen)

After all, maybe she just wants to

apologize...

KAREN

I have no possible interest in

anything she'd have to say.

BILL

But what could she say? That's what

fascinates me...

LLOYD

Go on - find out...

MARGO

Karen, in all the years of our

friendship, I have never let you go

to the Ladies' Room alone. But now

I must. I am busting to know what

goes on in that feverish little

brain waiting there...

KAREN

Well... all right.

ADDISON

Karen! How nice...

BILL

Very effective. But why take it out

on me?

EVE

I was wondering whether you'd come

at all..

KAREN

Don't get up.

(she smiles grimly)

And don't act as if I were the

queen mother.

EVE

I don't expect you to be pleasant.

KAREN

I don't intend to be.

EVE

Can't we sit down? Just for a

minute...

EVE

I've got a lot to say. And none of

it is easy.

KAREN

There can't be very much-

EVE

Oh, but there is-

KAREN

- and easy or not, I won't believe

a word.

EVE

Why shouldn't you?

(a pause)

Please sit down.

EVE

You know, I've always considered

myself a very clever girl. Smart.

Good head on my shoulders, that

sort of thing, never the wrong word

at the wrong time... but then, I'd

never met Addison deWitt.

(another pause)

I remember once I had a tooth

pulled. They gave me some

anaesthetic - I don't remember the

name - and it affected me in a

strange way. I heard myself saying

things I wasn't even thinking... as

if my mind were someplace outside

of my body, and couldn't control

what I did or said-

KAREN

(leading her on)

- and you felt just like that

talking to Addison.

EVE

(nods)

In a way. You find yourself trying

to say what you mean, but somehow

the words change - and they become

his words - and suddenly you're not

saying what you mean, but what he

means-

KAREN

(sharply)

Do you expect me to believe that

you didn't say any of those things -

that they were all Addison?

EVE

No! I don't expect you to believe

anything. Except that the

responsibility is mine. And the

disgrace.

KAREN

Let's not get over-dramatic.

EVE

(smiles grimly)

You've really got a low opinion of

me, haven't you? We'll I'll give

you some pleasant news. I've been

told off in no uncertain terms all

over town. Miss Channing should be

happy to hear that. To know how

loyal her friends are - how much

more loyal they are than she had a

right to expect me to be...

KAREN

Eve... don't cry.

EVE

(turned away)

I'm not crying.

KAREN

Tell me. How did your lunch turn

out - with the man from Hollywood?

EVE

Some vague promises of a test,

that's all - if a particular part

should come along, one of those

things-

KAREN

But the raves about your

performance-

EVE

- an understudy's performance.

KAREN

Well. I think you're painting the

picture a little darker than it is,

really. If nothing else - and don't

underestimate him - you have a

powerful friend in Addison.

EVE

He's not my friend. You were my

friends...

KAREN

He can help you.

EVE

I wish I'd never met him, I'd like

him to be dead... I want my friends

back.

KAREN

Eve. I - I don't think you meant to

cause unhappiness. But you did.

More to yourself, perhaps - as it

turned out - than to anyone else...

EVE

I'll never get over it.

KAREN

(smiles)

Yes, you will. You Theater people

always do. Nothing is forever in

the Theater. Love or hate, success

or failure - whatever it is, it's

here, it flares up and burns hot -

and then it's gone.

EVE

I wish I could believe that.

KAREN

Give yourself time. Don't worry too

much about what people think,

you're very young and very

talented...

(she gets up, her hand

still on Eve's shoulder)

... and, believe it or not, if

there's anything I can do-

EVE

There is something.

KAREN

I think I know...

EVE

Something most important you can

do.

KAREN

You want to play "Cora." You want

me to tell Lloyd I think you should

play it.

EVE

If you told him so, he'd give me

the part. He said he would.

KAREN

After all you've said... don't you

know the part was written for

Margo?

EVE

It could have been - fifteen years

ago. It's my part now.

KAREN

You talk just as Addison said you

did.

EVE

"Cora" is my part. You've got to

tell Lloyd it's for me.

KAREN

I don't think anything in the world

could make me say that.

EVE

Addison wants me to play it.

KAREN

Over my dead body...

EVE

(cold, relentless)

That won't be necessary. Addison

knows how Margo happen to miss that

performance - how I happened to

know she'd miss it in time to call

him and notify every paper in

town...

(Karen stops struggling)

... it's quite a story.

Addison could make quite a thing of

it - imagine how snide and vicious

he could get and still write

nothing but the truth. I had a time

persuading him...

(she smiles, now)

... you'd better sit down. You look

a bit wobbly.

(Karen sits)

If I play "Cora," Addison will

never tell what happened - in or

out of print. A simple exchange of

favors. And I'm so happy I can do

something for you - at long last...

(Karen covers her face

with her hands)

Your friendship with Margo - your

deep, close friendship - what would

happen to it, do you think, if she

knew the chap trick you'd played on

her - for my benefit? And you and

Lloyd - how long, even in the

Theater, before people forgot what

happened - and trusted you again?

(now Eve gets up)

No... it would be so much easier on

everyone concerned, if I were to

play "Cora." And so much better

theater, too...

KAREN

A part in a play. You'd do all that

- just for a part in a play.

EVE

(smiles)

I'd do much more - for a part that

good.

ADDISON

Hungry?

EVE

Just some coffee.

ADDISON

(pours)

I'm not surprised. After all that

humble pie...

EVE

Nothing of the kind. Karen and I

had a nice talk.

ADDISON

Heart to heart? Woman to woman?

Including a casual reference to the

part of "Cora" - and your hopes of

playing it.

EVE

I discussed it very openly. I told

her that I had spoken to Lloyd -

and that he was interested.

ADDISON

She mentioned, of course, that

Margo expects to play the part?

EVE

Oddly enough - she didn't say a

word about Margo. Just that she'll

be happy to do what she can to see

that I play the part.

ADDISON

Just like that, eh?

EVE

Just like that.

ADDISON

(thoughtfully)

Do you know, Eve - sometimes I

think you keep things from me.

EVE

I don't think that's funny.

ADDISON

It wasn't meant to be.

EVE

I confide in you and rely on you

more than anyone I've ever known!

To say a thing like that now -

without any reason - when I need

you more than ever...

ADDISON

(breaks in)

I hope you mean what you say, Eve.

I intend to hold you to it.

ADDISON

We have a great deal in common, it

seems to me...

LLOYD

- well? What happened?

KAREN

Nothing much. She apologized.

MARGO

With tears?

KAREN

With tears.

MARGO

But not right away? First the

business of fighting them off, chin

up, stout fella...

KAREN

Check.

MARGO

Very classy stuff, lots of

technique-

LLOYD

You mean - all this time - she'd

done nothing but apologize? What'd

you say?

KAREN

Not much.

MARGO

Groom-

(Bill says "huh?")

- may I have a wedding present?

BILL

What would you like? Texas?

MARGO

I want everybody to shut up about

Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's

all I want. Give Karen more wine...

(blissfully)

... never have I been so happy.

Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub

Room. What a lovely, clever name.

Where the elite meet. Never have I

seen so much elite - and all with

their eyes on me. Waiting for me to

crack that little gnome over the

noggin with a bottle. But not

tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve...

there they go.

MARGO

There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little

Miss Evil. But the evil that men do

- how does it go, groom? Something

about the good they leave behind -

I played it once in rep in Wilkes

Barre...

BILL

You've got it backwards. Even for

Wilkes-Barre.

MARGO

You know why I forgive Eve? Because

she's left good behind - the four

of us, together like this, it's

Eve's fault - I forgive her...

MARGO

... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve

did that, too.

LLOYD

You know, she probably means well,

after all...

MARGO

She is a louse.

BILL

(to Lloyd)

Never try to outguess Margo.

MARGO

Groom.

BILL

Yes, dear.

MARGO

You know what I'm going to be?

BILL

A cowboy.

MARGO

A married lady.

BILL

With the paper to prove it.

MARGO

I'm going to have a home. Not just

a house I'm afraid to stay in...

and a man to go with it. I'll look

up at six o'clock - and there he'll

be... remember, Karen?

KAREN

(quietly)

I remember.

MARGO

(to Bill)

You'll be there, won't you.

BILL

(grins)

Often enough to keep the franchise.

MARGO

A foursquare, upright, downright,

forthright married lady... that's

for me. And no more make believe!

Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.

(Lloyd nods)

I mean it, now. Grown-up women

only, I might even play a mother -

only one child, of course, not over

eight...

(they all smile)

Lloyd, will you promise not to be

angry with me?

LLOYD

(smiles)

That depends.

MARGO

I mean really, deeply angry...

LLOYD

I don't think I could be.

MARGO

Well. I don't want to play "Cora."

KAREN

(explodes)

What?

MARGO

(hastily)

Now wait a minute, you're always so

touchy about his plays, it isn't

the part - it's a great part. And a

fine play. But not for me anymore -

not a foursquare, upright,

downright, forthright married lady.

LLOYD

What's your being married got to do

with it?

MARGO

It means I've finally got a life to

live! I don't have to play parts

I'm too old for - just because I've

got nothing to do with my nights!

(then quietly)

I know you've made plans. I'll make

it up to you, believe me. I'll tour

a year with this one, anything -

only you do understand - don't you,

Lloyd?

LLOYD

What's so funny?

KAREN

Nothing...

BILL

Nothing?

KAREN

Everything... everything's so

funny...

KAREN'S VOICE

Lloyd never got around, somehow -

to asking me whether it was all

right with me for Eve to play

"Cora"... Bill, oddly enough,

refused to direct the play at first

- with Eve in it. Lloyd and Max

finally won him over... Margo never

came to a rehearsal, too much to do

around the house, she said. I'd

never known Bill and Lloyd to fight

as bitterly and as often... and

always over some business for Eve,

or a move or the way she read a

speech... but then I'd never known

Lloyd to meddle as much with Bill's

directing - as far as it affected

Eve, that is... somehow, Eve kept

them going. Bill stuck it out - and

Lloyd seemed happy - and I thought

it might be best if I skipped

rehearsals from then on...

KAREN'S VOICE

It seemed to me I had known always

that it would happen - and here it

was.

It felt helpless, that helplessness

you feel when you have no talent to

offer - outside of loving your

husband. How could I compete?

Everything Lloyd loved about me, he

had gotten used to long ago...

KAREN

Hello... who?... who's calling Mr.

Richards?

GIRL

My name wouldn't mean anything. I

room across the hall from Eve

Harrington, and she isn't well.

She's been crying all night and

hysterical, and she doesn't want a

doctor...

LLOYD

Who is it? What's it all about?

KAREN

(into phone)

Did Miss Harrington tell you to

call Mr. Richards?

GIRL

No, Eve didn't say to call him, but

I remembered I saw Mr. Richards

with her a couple of times - and I

thought they being such good

friends...

LLOYD

(into phone)

Hello...hello, this is Lloyd

Richards. Where is Eve? Let me talk

to her-

GIRL

She's up in her room, Mr. Richards.

I really hate to bother you like

this, but the way Eve's been

feeling - I'm just worried sick

what with her leaving for New Haven

tomorrow, and everything...

LLOYD

Tell her not to worry - tell her

I'll be right over.

GIRL

I'll tell her, Mr. Richards.

KAREN

(finally)

Aren't you... broadening the duties

of a playwright just a bit? Rushing

off in the middle of the night

like a country doctor?

KAREN

What would you do if, instead of

Eve, the leading man had called up

to say her was hysterical?

KAREN

Lloyd, I don't want you to go!

LLOYD

I didn't think you would! It seems

to me, Karen, that for some tine,

now, you've been developing a deep

unconcern for the feeling of human

being in general-

KAREN

I'm a human being, I've got some!

LLOYD

(goes right on)

- and for my feelings in

particular! For my play, my career -

and now for a frightened,

hysterical girl on the eve of her

first night in the Theater!

KAREN

Have you forgotten about Eve? What

she is, what she's done?

LLOYD

Old wives' tales, born of envy and

jealousy! And a phobia against

truth!

KAREN

Then tell me this isn't true! That

your concern for your play and

career is one thing - and that poor

frightened hysterical girl another -

and that your concern for her has

nothing to do with either your play

or your career!

KAREN

That first, last, and foremost -

your reason for going now is that

you want to be with Eve! Three in

the morning or high noon - play or

no play - wife or no wife!

(Lloyd stops at the door)

Isn't it true, Lloyd?

ADDISON'S VOICE

To the Theater world - New Haven,

Connecticut, is a short stretch of

sidewalk between the Shubert

Theater and the Taft Hotel,

surrounded by what looks very much

like a small city. It is here that

managers have what are called out

of-town openings - which are

openings for New Yorkers who want

to go out of town...

EVE

What a day - what a heavenly day...

ADDISON

D-day.

EVE

Just like it.

ADDISON

And tomorrow morning you will have

won your beachhead on the shores of

Immortality...

EVE

(grins)

Stop rehearsing your column...

Isn't it strange, Addison?

I thought I'd be panic-stricken,

want to run away or something.

Instead, I can't wait for tonight

to come. To come and go...

ADDISON

Are you that sure of tomorrow?

EVE

Aren't you?

ADDISON

Frankly - yes.

EVE

It'll be a night to remember. It'll

bring to me everything I've ever

wanted. The end of an old road -

and the beginning of a new one...

ADDISON

All paved with diamonds and gold?

EVE

You know me better than that.

ADDISON

Paved with what, then?

EVE

Stars.

EVE

What time?

ADDISON

Almost four.

EVE

Plenty of time for a nice long nap -

we rehearsed most of last night...

ADDISON

You could sleep, too, couldn't you?

EVE

Why not?

ADDISON

The mark of a true killer.

(he holds out his hand)

Sleep tight, rest easy - and come

out fighting...

EVE

Why'd call me a killer?

ADDISON

Did I say killer? I meant champion.

I get my boxing terms mixed.

EVE

(calling)

Addison-

(he pauses)

- come on in for just a minute,

won't you? There's... I've got

something to tell you.

ADDISON

Suites are for expense accounts.

Aren't you being extravagant?

EVE

Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd

had a terrific row but Lloyd

insisted... well. Can I fix you a

drink?

ADDISON

Also with the reluctant compliments

of Max Fabian.

EVE

Lloyd. I never have any, and he

likes a couple of drinks after we

finish - so he sent it up...

ADDISON

Some plain soda.

(Eve starts to fix it)

Lloyd must be expecting a record

run in New Haven...

EVE

That's for tonight. You're invited.

We're having everyone up after the

performance.

ADDISON

We're?

EVE

Lloyd and I.

ADDISON

I find it odd that Karen isn't here

for the opening, don't you?

EVE

Addison...

ADDISON

(blandly)

She's always been so fantastically

devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine

that only death or destruction

could keep her-

EVE

(breaks in)

Addison, just a few minutes ago.

When I told you this would be a

night to remember - that it would

bring me everything I wanted-

ADDISON

(nods)

- something about an old road

ending and a new one starting -

paved with stars...

EVE

I didn't mean just the Theater.

ADDISON

What else?

EVE

(her back to him)

Lloyd Richards. He's going to leave

Karen. We're going to be married.

ADDISON

So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the

Theater, after all...

EVE

(turns; shocked)

It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd

loves me, I love him!

ADDISON

I know nothing about Lloyd and his

loves - I leave those to Louisa May

Alcott. But I do know you.

EVE

I'm in love with Lloyd!

ADDISON

Lloyd Richards is commercially the

most successful playwright in

America-

EVE

You have no right to say such

things!

ADDISON

- and artistically, the most

promising! Eve dear, this is

Addison.

EVE

Addison, won't it be just perfect?

Lloyd and I - there's no telling

how far we can go... he'll write

great plays for me, I'll make them

be great!

(as she sits)

You're the only one I've told, the

only one that knows except Lloyd

and me...

ADDISON

... and Karen.

EVE

She doesn't know.

KAREN

She knows enough not to be here.

EVE

But not all of it - not that Lloyd

and I are going to be married.

ADDISON

(thoughtfully)

I see. And when was this unholy

alliance joined?

EVE

We decided the night before last,

before we came up here...

ADDISON

(increasingly tense)

Was the setting properly romantic -

the lights on dimmers, gypsy

violins off stage?

EVE

The setting wasn't romantic, but

Lloyd was. He woke me up at three

in the morning, banging on my door -

he couldn't sleep, he told me -

he's left Karen, he couldn't go on

with the play or anything else

until I promised to marry him... we

sat and talked until it was light.

He never went home...

ADDISON

You sat and talked until it was

light...

EVE

(meaningly)

We sat and talked, Addison. I want

a run of the play contract.

ADDISON

(quietly)

There never was, there'll never be

another like you.

EVE

(happily)

Well, say something - anything!

Congratulations, skol - good work,

Eve!

ADDISON

What do you take me for?

EVE

(cautiously)

I don't know what I take you for

anything...

ADDISON

(moving away)

It is possible - even conceivable -

that you've confused me with that

gang of backward children you've

been playing tricks on - that you

have the same contempt for me that

you have for them?

EVE

I'm sure you mean something by

that, Addison, but I don't know

what...

ADDISON

Look closely, Eve, it's time you

did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm

nobody's fool. Least of all -

yours.

EVE

I never intended you to be.

ADDISON

Yes, you did. You still do.

EVE

I still don't know what you're

getting at. Right now I want to

take my nap. It's important that I-

ADDISON

(breaks in)

- it's important right now that we

talk. Killer to killer.

EVE

(wisely)

Champion to champion.

ADDISON

Not with me, you're no champion.

You're stepping way up in class.

EVE

Addison, will you please say what

you have to say plainly and

distinctly - and then get out so I

can take my nap!

ADDISON

Very well, plainly and distinctly.

Although I consider it unnecessary -

because you know as well as I, what

I am about to say.

(they are now facing each

other)

Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will

not leave Karen for you.

EVE

What do you mean by that?

ADDISON

More plainly and more distinctly? I

Have not come to New Haven to see

the play, discuss your dreams, or

to pull the ivy from the walls of

Yale! I have come to tell you that

you will not marry Lloyd - or

anyone else - because I will not

permit it.

EVE

What have you got to do with it?

ADDISON

Everything. Because after tonight,

you will belong to me.

EVE

I can't believe my ears...

ADDISON

A dull cliche.

EVE

Belong - to you? That sound

medieval - something out of an old

melodrama...

ADDISON

So does the history of the world

for the past twenty years. I don't

enjoy putting it as bluntly as

this, frankly I had hoped that you

would, somehow, have known - have

taken it for granted that you and

I...

EVE

... taken it for granted? That you

and I...

ADDISON

(quietly)

Remember as long as you live, never

to laugh at me. At anything or

anyone else - but never at me.

EVE

Get out!

ADDISON

You're too short for that gesture.

Besides, it went out with Mrs.

Fiske.

EVE

Then if you won't get out, I'll

have you thrown out.

ADDISON

Don't pick it up! Don't even put

your hand on it...

ADDISON

Something told you to do as I say,

didn't it? That instinct is worth

millions, you can't buy it, cherish

it, Eve. When that alarm goes off,

go to your battle stations...

ADDISON

Your name is not Eve Harrington. It

is Gertrude Slescynski.

EVE

What of it?

ADDISON

It is true that your parents were

poor. They still are. And they

would like to know how you are -

and where. They haven't heard from

you for three years...

EVE

(curtly)

What of it?

ADDISON

A matter of opinion. Granted. It is

also true that you worked in a

brewery. But life in the brewery

was apparently not as dull as you

pictured it. As a matter of fact,

it got less and less dull - until

you boss's wife had your boss

followed by detectives!

EVE

(whirls on him)

She never proved anything, not a

thing!

ADDISON

But the $500 you got to get out of

town brought you straight to New

York - didn't it?

ADDISON

That $500 brought you straight to

New York - didn't it?

EVE

She was a liar, she was a liar!

ADDISON

Answer my question! Weren't you

paid to get out of town?

ADDISON

Fourth. There was no Eddie - no

pilot - and you've never been

married! That was not only a lie,

but an insult to dead heroes and to

the women who loved them...

(Eve, sobbing, puts her

hands over her ears;

Addison, closer, pulls

them away)

... Fifth. San Francisco has no

Shubert Theater and North Shore,

you've never been to San Francisco!

That was a stupid lie, easy to

expose, not worthy of you...

EVE

I had to get in, to meet Margo! I

had to say something, be somebody,

make her like me!

ADDISON

She did like you, she helped and

trusted you! You paid her back by

trying to take Bill away!

EVE

That's not true!

ADDISON

I was there, I saw you and heard

you through the dressing room door!

ADDISON

You used my name and my column to

blackmail Karen into getting you

the part of "Cora" - and you lied

to me about it!

EVE

(into the bed)

No-no-no...

ADDISON

I had lunch with Karen not three

hours ago. As always with women who

want to find out things, she told

more than she learned...

(he lets go of her hands)

... do you want to change your

story about Lloyd beating at your

door the other night?

EVE

Please... please...

ADDISON

That I should want you at all

suddenly strikes me as the height

of improbability. But that, in

itself, is probably the reason.

You're an improbable person, Eve,

and so am I. We have that in

common. Also a contempt for

humanity, an inability to love or

be loved, insatiable ambition - and

talent. We deserve each other. Are

you listening to me?

ADDISON

Then say so.

EVE

Yes, Addison.

ADDISON

And you realize - you agree how

completely you belong to me?

EVE

Yes, Addison.

ADDISON

Take your nap, now. And good luck

for tonight.

EVE

(tonelessly)

I won't play tonight.

(Addison pauses)

I couldn't. Not possibly. I

couldn't go on...

ADDISON

(smiles)

Couldn't go on? You'll give the

performance of your life.

ADDISON'S VOICE

And she gave the performance of her

life. And it was a night to

remember, that night...

EVE

Honored members of Sarah Siddons

Society, distinguished guests,

ladies and gentlemen: What is there

for me to say? Everything wise and

witty has long since been said - by

minds more mature and talents far

greater than mine. For me to thank

you as equals would be presumptuous

- I am an apprentice in the Theater

and have much to learn from you

all. I can say only that I am proud

and happy and that I regard this

great honor not so much as an award

for what I have achieved, but as a

standard to hold against what I

have yet to accomplish.

(applause)

And further, I regard it as

bestowed upon me only in part. The

larger share belongs to my friends

in the Theater - and to the Theater

itself, which has given me all I

have. In good conscience, I must

give credit where credit is due. To

Max Fabian-

EVE'S VOICE

- dear Max. Dear, sentimental,

generous, courageous Max Fabian -

who took a chance on an unknown,

untried, amateur...

EVE

And to my first friend in the

Theater - whose kindness and

graciousness I shall never

forget... Karen - Mrs. Lloyd

Richards...

EVE'S VOICE

... and it was Karen who first

brought me to one whom I had always

idolized - and who was to become my

benefactor and champion. A great

actress and a great woman - Margo

Channing.

EVE

My director - who demanded always a

little more than my talent could

provide-

EVE

- but who taught me patiently and

well... Bill Sampson.

EVE'S VOICE

And one, without whose great play

and faith in me, this night would

never have been. How can I repay

Lloyd Richards?

EVE

Hoe can I repay the many others? So

many, that I couldn't possibly name

them all...

EVE'S VOICE

... whose help, guidance and advice

have made this, the happiest night

of my life, possible.

EVE

Although I am going to Hollywood

next week to make a film - do not

think for a moment that I am

leaving you. How could I? For my

heart is here in the Theater - and

three thousand miles are too far to

be away from one's heart.

I'll be back to claim it - and

soon. That is, if you want me back.

AGED ACTOR

A good night to all - and to all a

good night!

LLOYD

For services rendered - beyond the

whatever-it-is-of-duty, darling.

MAX

Come on! I'm the host, I gotta get

home before the guests start

stealing the liquor...

KAREN

Congratulations, Eve.

EVE

Thank you, Karen.

MAX

(to Addison)

I'm giving her a very high-class

party. It ain't like a rehearsal,

she don't have to be late.

ADDISON

As soon as the peasants stop pawing

her.

MARGO

... nice speech, Eve. But I

wouldn't worry too much about your

heart. You can always put that

award where your heart ought to be.

EVE

I don't suppose there's a drink

left...

ADDISON

You can have one at Max's.

EVE

(sits)

I don't think I'm going.

ADDISON

(sighs)

Why not?

EVE

Because I don't want to.

ADDISON

(patiently)

Max has gone to a great deal of

trouble, it's going to be an

elaborate party, and it's for you.

EVE

No, it's not.

(she holds up the award)

It's for this.

ADDISON

It's the same thing, isn't it?

EVE

Exactly.

(she gives him the award)

Here. Take it to the party instead

of me.

ADDISON

You're being childish.

EVE

I'm tired. I want to go home.

ADDISON

(curtly)

Very well. I shall drop you and go

on to the party. I have no

intention of missing it...

EVE

Who are you?

GIRL

Miss Harrington...

EVE

What are you doing here?

GIRL

I - I guess I fell asleep.

GIRL

Please don't have me arrested,

please! I didn't steal anything -

you can search me!

EVE

(pauses)

How did you get in here?

GIRL

I hid outside in the hall till the

maid came to turn down your bed.

She must've forgot something and

when she went to get it, she left

the door open. I sneaked in and hid

till she finished. Then I just

looked around - and pretty soon I

was afraid somebody'd notice the

lights were on so I turned them off

- and then I guess, I fell asleep.

EVE

You were just looking around...

GIRL

That's all.

EVE

What for?

GIRL

You probably won't believe me.

EVE

Probably not.

GIRL

It was for my report.

EVE

What report? To whom?

GIRL

About how you live, what kind of

clothes you wear - what kind of

perfume and books - things like

that. You know the Eve Harrington

clubs - that they've got in most of

the girls' high schools?

EVE

I've heard of them.

GIRL

Ours was one of the first. Erasmus

Hall. I'm the president.

EVE

Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn,

isn't it?

GIRL

Lots of actresses come from

Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan

Hayward - of course, they're just

movie stars.

GIRL

You're going to Hollywood - aren't

you?

(Eve murmurs "uh-huh")

From the trunks you're packing, you

must be going to stay a long time.

EVE

I might.

GIRL

That spilled drink is going to ruin

your carper.

EVE

The maid'll fix it in the morning.

GIRL

I'll just pick up the broken glass.

EVE

Don't bother.

EVE

How'd you get all the way up here

from Brooklyn?

GIRL

Subway.

EVE

How long does it take?

GIRL

With changing and everything, a

little over an hour.

EVE

It's after one now. You won't get

home till all hours.

GIRL

(smiles)

I don't care if I never get home.

EVE

That's the door.

GIRL

You rest. I'll get it...

ADDISON

Hello, there. Who are you?

GIRL

(shyly)

Miss Harrington's resting, Mr.

deWitt. She asked me to see who it

is...

ADDISON

We won't disturb her rest. It seems

she left her award in the taxicab.

Will you give it to her?

ADDISON

How do you know my name?

GIRL

It's a very famous name, Mr.

deWitt.

ADDISON

And what is your name?

GIRL

Phoebe.

ADDISON

Phoebe?

GIRL

(stubbornly)

I call myself Phoebe.

ADDISON

Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you

want some day to have an award like

that of your own?

PHOEBE

More than anything else in the

world.

ADDISON

Then you must Miss Harrington how

to get one. Miss Harrington knows

all about it...

EVE'S VOICE

(sleepy; from the living

room)

Who was it?

PHOEBE

Just a taxi driver, Miss

Harrington. You left the award in

his cab and he brought it back...

EVE'S VOICE

Oh. Put it on one of the trunks,

will you? I want to pack it...

PHOEBE

Sure, Miss Harrington...

FADE OUT.
