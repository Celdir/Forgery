2.

DOUGLAS

Last delivery's finally here.

ARMORED TRUCK GUARD

Party?

DOUGLAS

Introducing a new line of jewelry.

ARMORED TRUCK GUARD

Wife wants me to buy her a ruby ring.

Told her to spend a little time with

the family jewels first.

ARMORED TRUCK GUARD

Keep it real.

3.

FAIT

Watch yourself.

4.

FAIT

Keep it tight.

FAIT

Bull's-eye.

5.

CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)

Yes?

FAIT (V.O.)

We're in position.

CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)

Delivery confirmed. The stones are

there.

FAIT (V.O.)

Not for long.

6.

SU (0.S.)

Where are the stones?

CHRISTOPHE

(French accent)

Who the fuck are you?

SU

Who's getting them for you?

CHRISTOPHE

Fuck off.

CHRISTOPHE

I'll tell you.

SU

I know.

FAIT

Daria.

7.

DARIA

I'm here for the reception.

DOUGLAS

Name, please?

DARIA

Angie Rawlins.

DOUGLAS

Thank you. You can go on up.       Front

elevator, to the mezzanine.

DARIA

... I hate these things.      Don't you

hate these things?

DOUGLAS

I'm just here to do my job.

DARIA

Then again, you never know who you're

going to meet...

DARIA

8.

I'll bet you're a lot more fun than

any of those boring people upstairs.

DOUGLAS

Really, ma'am.   I have a job to do.

DARIA

Well, I suppose I should go up and

see what they're selling.

DARIA

Tommy...

DARIA

Change of plans. He's gay.

TOMMY

No way.

DARIA

Yeah way.

FAIT

Tommy.    Your turn.

9.

TOMMY

Uh-uh.

FAIT

This isn't a conversation.    Do it.

TOMMY

Shit.

DARIA

Key-card.

DARIA

Why don't you keep my purse?     I

shouldn't be too long.

TOMMY

... Aloha.

thru 28.)

DOUGLAS

Hi.

TOMMY

I hope you don't take offense at

this... but I just have such a

weakness for a man in uniform.

DOUGLAS

If that's your thing...

TOMMY

Uniform's definitely my thing. I

mean, I see a sailor, I'm thinking,

mmm, seafood. Y'know?

DOUGLAS

I'm not actually supposed to be

10.

talking on duty.

TOMMY

Who's talking? Honey, this is a

flirting... But you're probably just

another good-looking man wasting it

all on women. World's full of fools.

TOMMY

Yahtzee!... Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have-

A-Hard-Nightstick. Put away the

pictures of those underfed, white

males and let's broaden your

horizons.

TOMMY (CONT'D)

I like sunsets and puppy dogs, and

I'm big in the pants. Just hope I'm

not too cute for you. And don't tell

me it's a color thing, hon, or I'll

come over there and slap a little

discrimination right upside your

yummy little cheeks.

DOUGLAS

I'm hooked up.

TOMMY

Another big, hot, cuddly, black love-

Jesus got there first. That bitch.

Taking you. From me.

DOUGLAS

Sorry.

TOMMY

Hey... This day and age, sweetie, I

can appreciate the monogamy. Saving

it for your number one is keeping the

world safe, and it's okay by me.

Even if you are just breaking my

heart... Guess I'll just have to come

in here someday, let you catch me

shoplifting and resist arrest -- just

to have you wrestle me down and cuff

me.

DOUGLAS

I can be pretty rough.

TOMMY

Don't you get me all excited now.   I

was just learning to accept my

disappointment.

11.

TOMMY

Tommy.     But you can call me Rachel.

DOUGLAS

Douglas. And, man, I really gotta

get back to what I'm supposed to be

doing, okay?

TOMMY

I'll leave you alone. But is it okay

if I just stand here and stare at the

muscles I'll be missing for the rest

of my

life?

12.

13.

FAIT

Out.

SU

... I want to report a crime in

progress.

FAIT

Faith.

MILES

Faith.

DARIA

Faith.

TOMMY

Earthquake.

14.

TOMMY

Bet you know how to hit a ten on the

Richter scale...

DARIA

Holy shit...

FAIT

This will trigger the silent alarm.

Let's go. We got eleven minutes.

FAIT

... I love colored stones... Look at

this...

FAIT

Two-point-seven million.

MILES

Whose shit we stealing, anyway?

FAIT

Drug dealers and money launderers.

DARIA

Works for me.

FAIT

This I can use.

15.

DARIA

T.

FAIT

Pow.

FAIT

Go.

SU

Your employer betrayed you. The

police are on the way. Leave the

black stones.

FAIT

Who is this?

SU

You know the ones I mean.

FAIT

Don't think I'll do that.

TOMMY

Shit.  Five-0 at the do'.

(then, aloud to

Douglas)

Better move my car.

16.

FAIT

Go time.     Leave the rest.

SWAT COP

Move it out.

FAIT

Stopped the trains.

(then)

We're in the rabbit hole, they're

sending down the snakes.

(then)

Daria comes with me.

(to Miles)

I got no idea where you should go,

but you know where to end up.

FAIT

Faith.

MILES

Faith.

17.

SWAT COP #2

All clear.

SWAT COP #3

Hold it.

18.

SWAT COP #3

(radios)

Train's clear.

DRIVER

Okay to go?

SWAT COP #4

Just hang tight.

FAIT

Nice.

RADIO (V.O.)

All clear.

SWAT COP #4

(to Driver)

Okay.    Get this train outta here.

19.

SU

The stones.

MILES

You'll have to come and get 'em.

20.

LING

Enjoying California?

CHARLES

Hope we're not here long.    I hate

sunshine.

SONA

We may have a problem.

LING

The stones?

SONA

The exchange was just robbed.

LING

... Let's hope that was part of the

plan.

SU

21.

Who's in charge?

COP

Who wants to know?

COP

Follow me.

FAIT

You know it's past your bedtime.

VANESSA

Just a little longer.

FAIT

(imitating sweetly)

'Just a little longer'... School

tomorrow, baby. Let's go.

FAIT

'Exit.' 'Quit.' 'Do not save.'

'Special.' 'Shut down.' Sleepy-

time.

FAIT

You bag some Z's now, you hear?

VANESSA

Okay.

FAIT

... Wait a second.

VANESSA

What?

FAIT

I think there's something behind your

22.

ear.

VANESSA

Oh, please, that is so lame.     It's in

your hand.

VANESSA

How'd you do that?

FAIT

Good night.

FAIT

Angels east, angels west, north and

south, do your best. Guard her,

watch her, while she rests.

FAIT

She'll stay down now.

TONITA

She won't listen to me lately.     Only

you.

FAIT

I'll have a talk with her about it

tomorrow.

FAIT

I got some work to do in the office.

You can go on to bed.

23.

TONITA

I'm watching TV, if you need me.

TOMMY

What the hell happened?

TOMMY

Should we be considering a

long vacation in a warm,

foreign climate where there's

no extradition?

FAIT

The guy who called was only

interested in the black stones...

DARIA

Christophe sold us out.

FAIT

Or something.

DARIA

You made it.

MILES

By the skin of my ass. Some

Chinese dude kicked me around

the motherfuckin' block. Busted

my ear piece.

MILES

Snagged my loot, too... Maybe time to

24.

rethink the no-gun policy.

TOMMY

Little ass-whuppin's nothing. 'Least

you didn't have to play all foxy with

the rent-a-cop.

FAIT

Means this is all we got.

DARIA

So what do we do?

FAIT

You all wait to hear from me.

TOMMY

Where're you going?

FAIT

To get some answers.

MILES

I got your back.

FAIT

No. I got us into this.     I'll call

you if I need you.

DARIA

Be careful.

25.

LING

So this is Mr. Christophe?

SONA

Yes. Only the handcuffs and fish

tank are a new look.

LING

Apparently we're not his first

visitors today.

CHRISTOPHE

Please, Monsieur Ling --

LING

Whatever you're going to say... Make

it the truth.

VOICE (O.S.)

Bang.

ARCHIE

Like it?

FAIT

It's cool.

ARCHIE

Want it? Give you a good deal. Ammo

included... Reactive armor, twin M240

machine guns, 120mm smoothbore

cannon. Guaranteed to get you

through the rougher areas of the city

and keep the neighbors in line.

FAIT

Pass.

26.

ARCHIE

How about a Marine Corps assault

hovercraft?

FAIT

I got other business.

MAN UNLOADING HOT TVS

We're outta room over here, Arch.

ARCHIE

Stack 'em in the office, if you have

to.

ARCHIE

... You weren't downtown tonight by

any chance, were you, Tony?

FAIT

Don't know what you're talking about.

ARCHIE

Me either.

FAIT

Ever see black diamonds before?

ARCHIE

White, blue, yellow, pink. Neil

Diamond. Lou Diamond Phillips.

Black diamonds? Solid rocks? No.

ARCHIE

You got me.

FAIT

Find out how much they're worth.

ARCHIE

There a timetable on this, or --

FAIT

Yesterday.

ARCHIE

That's what I figured.

27.

FAIT

I'll be back. I gotta go fuck over a

guy who fucked me over.

SU (O.S.)

Looks dead to me.

FAIT

Guess you got to him first.

SU

Not me.     Someone else.

FAIT

... You're the one who called me.

The one who took on my guy... Who the

fuck are you, man?

SU

My name is Su.

FAIT

Cool.     I'm Sally.

SU

I want the black stones.

28.

FAIT

Yeah?   Make me an offer.

SU

You can walk out of here.

FAIT

... No deal.

CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)

Christophe here. Leave a message.

LING (V.O.)

I know you're there, Mr. Fait.

FAIT

Who's this?

LING

The man for   whom Mr. Christophe

arranged to   have the black stones

brought into   the country and

deposited at   the jewelry exchange.

The man who   wants them back. Now.

FAIT

Fine.   How much?

LING

Maybe you didn't understand me.    The

stones are already mine.

FAIT

I got 'em, I'm selling 'em. So get

your bid in or go fuck yourself.

29.

LING

I don't have time for this.

FAIT

That your final offer?

LING

I can be a very dangerous man, Mr.

Fait.

FAIT

Everybody think I'm the fucking

Goodwill or something...? Look, I've

had a shitty night, and so far, I got

zip for all my troubles. So I don't

know who the fuck you are, and I

don't care. But hear this: you can

beat my ass around the block all

night --

Brother, it ain't gonna get you those

stones.

FAIT

Oh, man...

30.

LING THUG #1

Give us the stones.

FAIT

Man, how many times I gotta tell

people: I'm a business man. Make me

a motherfucking offer.

LING THUG #2

Here's your offer.

FAIT

That shit ain't gonna do it, biggie.

'Cause I ain't scared of guns, and I

ain't got the stones.

LING THUG #1

Then you're gonna tell us where they

are.

31.

SU

Over here.

FAIT

Man, what the hell's up with these

fucking stones?

(into phone)

Go.

32.

ARCHIE

It's Archie.    Bad news.   We got a

problem.

ARCHIE (O.S.)

... I did what you said, right? Put

it out on the street, trying to get

info on the stones. Next thing I

know, the Jackson Five here show

up... Now, there are three

significant elements to notice here.

One, I'm outnumbered. Two, they're

heavily armed. Three, they're gonna

beat me like a bongo drum...

ARCHIE

... I mean, hey, I coulda resisted,

sure -- and they coulda beat me into

a coma or killed me or whatever --

but then, see, I'm thinking: How

would I be able to tell Tony what

happened to the stones? Right? What

good am I dead or on life-support.

So I threw in the towel.

Reluctantly, of course. For your

sake.

FAIT

Okay. You saved yourself to tell me.

So tell me.

ARCHIE

What?

33.

FAIT

ARCHIE

FAIT

ARCHIE

FAIT

ARCHIE

FAIT

SU

ARCHIE

FAIT

ARCHIE

(re: footage)

FAIT

ARCHIE

FAIT

SU

34.

FAIT

Runs the biggest outfit in town.

What warlords are to Afghanistan,

Chambers is to L.A... And you want to

take him on, you're on your own.

Game over for me.

(beat; then)

And now that I'm truly fucked -- what

the hell are you, anyway? You got

some I.D.?

FAIT

Doesn't mean shit to me.

ARCHIE

Let me see that.

ARCHIE

Taiwan. Central Security Bureau.

Taiwanese intelligence.

FAIT

You read Chinese?

ARCHIE

No. But I know 'cop' in every

language.

FAIT

What, you some kinda Asian James

Bond?

SU

The stones belong to my government.

FAIT

Yeah, well, they're Chambers' now.

And even governments don't go to war

with him.

FAIT

I'm starting to hate this phone.

(answers)

What now?

35.

LING

I hope you've reconsidered.

FAIT

Hey, it's Mr. Dangerous.   'Sup,

'homie'?

LING

You've made this difficult, Mr. Fait.

Let me make it easy.

FAIT

Can't wait to hear.

LING

I have your daughter.

LING

She's very pretty in her pink

pajamas. Aren't you, Vanessa?

VANESSA

Daddy!

FAIT

Vanessa!

LING

I want my stones, Mr. Fait.

FAIT

Motherfucker...

LING

You think about it a moment. Let me

talk to the Chinese gentleman who's

with you.

FAIT

Don't you hurt her.

LING

That's up to you... The Chinese

36.

gentleman, please?

FAIT

He has my daughter.

ARCHIE

Oh, Jesus...

FAIT

He wants to talk to you.

SU

Hello.

LING

I thought I killed you.

SU

I have the stones.      No negotiations.

Let the girl go.

LING

Do you really want one more person to

die?

SU

No negotiations.

FAIT

What'd you just do?     What happened?

SU

I said I have the stones and won't

negotiate for your daughter.

FAIT

You what?

ARCHIE

Oh, Jesus...

SU

It will confuse him.     Buy us time and

keep her alive.

FAIT

37.

What the fuck're you talking about?

That asshole has my daughter.

SU

Look -- I know him.

(then)

I want the stones, you want your

daughter. We'll get them both back.

We'll work together.

FAIT

... I gotta work with you?

SU

You have no choice.

FAIT

... Shit... We gotta go see

Chambers...

(beat, then)

Oh, god... Vanessa...

LING

Find a place to put her.

VANESSA

My daddy's gonna come and kick your

butts.

LING

Su says he has the stones... But why

cut me off? Why not negotiate for

the girl? It doesn't make sense.

SONA

38.

The buyers fly in tomorrow.   Should

we stop them?

LING

We'll never regain their confidence.

(beat)

We need information. Find the right

people. Pay whatever it costs.

Something's not right. Something's

happening with the stones.

SONA

What about the girl?

LING

We'll need her... She stays alive.

For now.

FAIT

I'm on the way to Chambers... Yeah, I

know, but I got no other choice.

Just get the word into his pipeline

that I'm coming and want permission

to visit... I'll get back to you...

Faith...

(hangs up)

Maybe Chambers'll have a heart and

give the stones back.

(then)

Yeah, right -- and maybe he'll join

the Peace Corps.

SU

I'm sorry about your daughter... How

old is she?

FAIT

This ain't the Biography Channel.

Let's just get there.

FAIT

Eight.   She'll be nine in September.

SU

39.

Mine is fifteen... Boyfriends...

FAIT

Never happen.    I'll just kill

'em.

SU

I wish it were that easy.

FAIT

About time I got the 4-1-1.

SU

4-1-1?

FAIT

What's this all about?

SU

The stones aren't what you think they

are.

FAIT

No shit.

(then)

How about the guy who has Vanessa?

SU

He's exactly what you think he is --

a thief and a killer.

FAIT

Great...

CHARLES

Where'd you get that piece of shit?

LING THUG #1

Let's just say Grandma and Grandpa

have a long walk back from the

40.

campground.

CHARLES

You're sure you cleaned it out?

LING THUG #1

Everything except the denture cream

and adult diapers.

CHARLES

I'm sick of her already.

CHARLES

Shut up!

VANESSA

You shut up!

CHARLES

Go to sleep!

FAIT

Angels east, angels west, north and

south, do your best. Guard her,

watch her, while she rests.

41.

CHAMBERS

Metz.

CHAMBERS

D.V.D.'s broke.

METZ

Get you a new one straight away, Mr.

Chambers.

CHAMBERS

Thanks for your patience.   Man needs

his nightly rest.

(then)

Who's the gook?

42.

FAIT

... Chinese guy.

CHAMBERS

... No shoes in my crib.

CHAMBERS

In.

FAIT

How you doing, Jump?

CHAMBERS

Don't waste my precious time.

FAIT

... I got a problem.

CHAMBERS

How's Daria?

FAIT

... Good.

CHAMBERS

Always was good. From the moment I

found her till the moment you took

her away from me. Problem, you say?

FAIT

... The black stones.

CHAMBERS

Bitch brought it in. Made me a lotta

money. But that all stopped. You

stopped that. You decided it was

okay to put an end to that. Black

stones. Go on.

FAIT

I need 'em back.

CHAMBERS

Only smart thing was not pimping her

yourself, 'cause then I'da been real

sore-angry, and you'da both been real

cold-dead...

CHAMBERS (CONT'D)

But you don't pimp, do you? Just a

43.

thief in the night. Stealing what

don't belong to you.

CHAMBERS

You like tall white women?

CHAMBERS

He can't talk?

SU

I don't speak Korean.

CHAMBERS

Bought myself this Korean club

downtown. Packing in the Seoul

brothers 24-7-365... Black man

gouging Koreans, ain't that a

switch... Motherfuckers got faces

like walls, but they love to drink

liquor and look at naked girls...

Place is no shitbox, either. Got me

an office looks like a kabuki love

palace. My own little sanctuary --

CHAMBERS

-- just waiting for when I parole

out... Stop by sometime, eyeball the

poon.

FAIT

... Jump, my daughter's mixed up in

this. I gotta have the stones, or

she's dead.

FAIT

If you need something more than that,

here it is...

(this is hard)

I'm begging you, Jump.

CHAMBERS

Big heist. Risky heist. Breaking

news. I'm watching it wondering why.

44.

What's worth that kind of trouble,

that kind of heat? Gotta be

something good. Gotta be something

expensive.

FAIT

She's my little girl.

CHAMBERS

Make another one... Lotta offspring

running around. Big scores're rare

in a lifetime.

CHAMBERS

Slope's no dope.

CHICKENS

Let me cut one of these

motherfuckers.

CHAMBERS

Your choice.

CHAMBERS

Say hey to Daria. And don't forget

your shoes.

FAIT

I used to look up to that guy.      All I

wanted was to be like him.

45.

SU

In Taiwan, I could force him to talk.

FAIT

This ain't Taiwan.

(then)

Only thing we can do now is find out

where the stones are and go take 'em.

SU

You make it sound easy.

FAIT

It won't be.

FAIT

... They're at his club.

SU

How do you know?

FAIT

I know. I can feel it.      That ever

happen to you?

SU

No.

FAIT

I thought Chinese people were all

mystical and shit.

SU

We like to gamble.     Not guess.

FAIT

It's no guess... But I could be

wrong... We'll hit the club. You

gotta see Archie.

SU

Archie?

FAIT

He's gotta remember something about

the guys who took down his place.

SU

What if he can't?

FAIT

Pretend it's Taiwan.    Make him

remember.

46.

RUSSELL

Hey!    Get away from there!

RUSSELL

What are you doing?!

CHARLES

Whoa. Take it easy. Just seeing if

I could help with something.

RUSSELL

You can't! It's very delicate

equipment! Stay away! Just stay

away from my truck!

CHARLES

What?

RUSSELL

Stay away from my truck!

CHARLES

What?

RUSSELL

Stay away from my truck!

CHARLES

What?

SONA

Stop it.

VANESSA (O.S.)

I want my daddy!

47.

CHARLES

I'm backing away... I'm backing

away...

VANESSA (O.S.)

I want my daddy! I want my daddy!

CHARLES

Someone give the geek his Ritalin.

SONA

At least he's doing his job. Which

is more than I can say for some

people.

VANESSA (O.S.)

I want my daddy! I want my daddy!

SONA

Tape her up and gag her.

VANESSA

I want my daddy! I want my daddy!    I

want my daddy!

CHARLES

Get the hell off me.

CHARLES

... Waste of time... I can think of a

better way of shutting you

up --

48.

CHARLES

Shit.

(yells to Sona)

She got the key!

49.

ODION

Delicious Daria.

DARIA

'Sup, Odion?

ODION

Long time no see.

ODION

Like cognac. Just getting better.

(then)

So what brings you around?

DARIA

... Sometimes you need an old friend,

y'know?

ODION

Got trouble?

DARIA

... With a capital 'T.'

ODION

Tony Fait? Thought you and him were

tight. Bonnie and Clyde.

DARIA

Used to be that way. Not treating me

right these days. The kid's all he

cares about.

ODION

... What do you want me to do?

DARIA

... Man, I don't know. Probably

nothing you can do. I just

50.

thought...

(then)

Hey, y'know, this is crazy. I don't

know what I was thinking. I

shouldn't even be here like this.

Sorry, Odion.

ODION

Nah, hey, hold up. It's okay.

DARIA

Back in the day... Just always seemed

like you and I had something special

between us.

ODION

Didn't know you thought so.

DARIA

I always cared for you, Odion.

That's why I'm here.

ODION

... You looking for a job?

DARIA

I need something.

ODION

... So maybe you could work here.

DARIA

Here?... Oh, man, I don't know.

ODION

You were the best. Not many girls

pulling in two g's a night.

DARIA

Yeah, but it's been a while for

that... Might not remember how.

ODION

Just like a bicycle, baby.     You don't

forget that stuff.

DARIA

Don't know how Jump'd feel about it.

Having me back.

ODION

Hey, you let me worry about Jump,

51.

okay?

(then)

Meantime, why don't you come on in,

and you and me can, y'know, talk some

more about it.

DARIA

... Just talk?

ODION

... No.

SU

They have boxing matches in the day?

ARCHIE

Not exactly boxing. More dangerous.

No gloves. No rules. Big money.

Very illegal... Started holding 'em

during the daytime to fool the cops.

SU

The man you remembered -- how do you

know he will be here?

ARCHIE

I don't. But Chambers owns the

operation, so I figure it's a good

place to start.

(then)

This is it.

52.

SU

How will you recognize him?

ARCHIE

I didn't see his face.   But I'll know

his pinkie ring when I  see it. Ten

carats. Round cut with   square mount.

Good color and clarity.   I remember

thinking what it would  do to my face

if he hit me.

SU

How do we get in?

ARCHIE

Leave that to me.

ARCHIE

Hey, man, how you doing? Got a

fighter here I want to enter.

ARCHIE

My man's gonna put the rest of these

bums to beddy-bye. He'll go in there

and get all Chinese on 'em -- the

teeth are gonna fly, the blood's

gonna run... Gonna be fun.

GUARD

Whatever... You're number twelve,

Bruce.

SU

I didn't come here to fight.

ARCHIE

You won't have to. That was just to

get us in.

53.

ARCHIE

Good day, over a million dollars'll

pass hands in here.

SU

Find the ring.

ARCHIE

Yeah.    Okay.

ARCHIE

Could take a little while.

DARIA

Sit down.

DARIA

Put on some music.

DARIA

Nah.    Something slower.

DARIA

That's good... Now just relax... And

watch...

54.

FAIT

Tommy.

TOMMY

Here come da bug man.

TOMMY

Hey.    Howzit?

DOORMAN

What the hell you doing?

TOMMY

Pest control. Don't tell me you

didn't get your notice.

DOORMAN

What notice?

TOMMY

See, that burns my ass right to the

bone. I mean, hey, I'm here doing my

job... Anyway, putting that aside, if

you had gotten your notice, you'd

know there's a new city ordinance

saying all businesses catering to

foreigners gotta be sprayed.

DOORMAN

Yeah?    How come?

TOMMY

'Cause foreign people're bringing all

55.

their scary-assed foreign bugs over

here. Y'know, in their luggage and

shit. And then the bugs're getting

loose and fucking everything up --

eating all the trees and everything,

y'know, making people sick... Anyway,

city says we gotta spray to prevent

any infestation and possible spread.

DOORMAN

We're doing business inside. Can't

let you just start hosing the place

with bug spray.

TOMMY

Yeah, well, maybe you should at least

ask the manager about it.

DOORMAN

Manager's busy.

TOMMY

... Okay. Your call. Just know the

city quarantine people'll be here

first thing tomorrow.

DOORMAN

Quarantine people?

TOMMY

They'll be shutting you down for non-

compliance... Peace out.

DOORMAN

Wait, wait, wait.

DOORMAN

City's really gonna come and close us

up?

TOMMY

Quicker'n a Zip-loc.

DOORMAN

... You sure you're not fucking with

me?

TOMMY

I'm a licensed exterminator.   Why

would I be fucking with you?

56.

TOMMY

Look. Let's do this. You let me

start with a couple small rooms,

y'know, offices or something,

someplace you don't have customers.

Upstairs, so the fumes don't bother

anybody. I'll pop off a couple bug

bombs, and then we'll do the rest

later. How's that?

DOORMAN

... Yeah, okay. Get the bombs, and

come on.

TOMMY

... Look.   At.   This.

DOORMAN

Just do your thing and go,

bro.

TOMMY

Roger that.

TOMMY

Just keep the door closed and be sure

to give this shit a full hour before

anyone comes in.

57.

FAIT

Safe.

FAIT

Take it down.

MILES

Even with the music, they're gonna

hear it when I fire this tank buster.

FAIT

Daria.   Get ready to move.

(then)

58.

Do it.

ODION

What was that?

ODION

'Sometimes you need an old friend'...

CHAMBERS MAN

It came from the office.

ODION

Watch her.   Don't let her leave.

MILES

Not here?

FAIT

They're here.    Somewhere else.

MILES

What're you talking about?

59.

FAIT

I'm telling you, they're here.

MILES

What're we gonna do?

FAIT

Everyone out.

MILES

What about you?

FAIT

I gotta save Vanessa.     I gotta find

'em.

MILES

I'm not leaving you.

FAIT

Yes, you are.    Go.   Now.

MILES

T. Come on, man. They're outside.

Give it up.

FAIT

Shut up and get the fuck outta here!

That's an order!

CHAMBERS MAN

... Y'know, I got the big one...

DARIA

Keep it in your pants.

60.

CHAMBERS

... If you're willing to pay five,

you're willing to pay ten.

CHAMBERS (CONT'D)

You're    willing to pay ten, you're

willing    to pay twenty. Twenty,

forty.     Forty, eighty... I'm not

selling    till I know exactly where the

ceiling    is.

CHAMBERS

You like foreplay?

LING

How much money do you want for the

stones?

CHAMBERS

I hate foreplay. Fuck the warm-up

drills -- girl's gotta get in there

and be ready to score points. Bring

it straight to the motherfucking

hoop. You understand?

(beat)

So, instead of us going back and

forth doing warm-ups, my idea's for

you to think of a number. A very

high number. A very final number. A

number so high and final it'll get me

off good, bam, right when I hear it.

61.

CHAMBERS

Okay, okay...

CHAMBERS

Ain't worth my life... I'll take the

five and call it a game.

LING

Mr. Chambers is resting.   He says not

to bother him.

ARCHIE

... By the way, when we do find him,

what then?

SU

I'll handle it.

62.

RING ANNOUNCER

Seven advances, eleven's out...

Next up, eight versus twelve. Eight

versus twelve. Fighters report to

the cage.

ARCHIE

You're after the stones, too, huh?

ARCHIE

... I did some more checking around

to see what anyone knows about 'em...

Guess who get back to me? My Defense

Department connection. Now, I think

he's calling me about this surplus F-

14 Tomcat I'm trying to get my hands

on. But no. Turns out he's calling

to tell me about a rumor outta Taiwan

about black stones --

RING ANNOUNCER

Number twelve!

ARCHIE

(to Su)

-- only they're not jewels --

RING ANNOUNCER

Number twelve!

ARCHIE

They're --

FIGHT CLUB FAN

Twelve's right here!

FIGHT CLUB FAN

I'd be scared of him, too.

63.

BRUISER

Let's go, chickenshit!

SU

Not today...

ARCHIE

I know it    wasn't the plan. But if

you don't    fight, they're gonna toss

us out on    our asses. We might never

find the    guy.

COP #1

He's pretty beat up.

ODION

Yeah. Fell down the stairs... Enjoy

the jail sex, Fait.

COP #2

Better have the E.M.T.s look at his

head.

DARIA

We're still here to help you, T.

MILES

Anything you want us to do?

FAIT

64.

Not yet.

PARAMEDIC

What?

FAIT

Nothing.

65.

SU

You win.

RING ANNOUNCER

No quitting.    Get back in there.

MOTO-RIDER #1

Looking good.

MOTO-RIDER #2

Nice rack.

MOTO-RIDER #1

Like the upstairs, like the basement,

66.

too.

DARIA

Shut up, assholes...

PARAMEDIC

He's all patched up.

COP #1

Let's go.

FAIT

Get ready to move.

FAIT

Get the car.     Stay close.

67.

MOTO-RIDER #1

Hey!

MOTO-RIDER #1

Don't let that fucker get away!

TV ANCHOR (V.O.)

... We go now to this breaking

story...

TV ANCHOR (V.O.)

... You're watching a man on an all-

terrain vehicle leading police in a

high-speed chase through downtown Los

Angeles. An L.A.P.D. spokesman says

the man, Anthony Fait --

TV ANCHOR (V.O.)

-- commandeered the A.T.V. after

escaping from police officers while

being treated at a local hospital for

injuries resulting from his earlier

arrest for robbery... And this is

certainly one of the wildest chases

we've witnessed here in L.A...

68.

69.

FAIT

Yo.

DARIA

Here.

FAIT

Above ground parking garage in

Chinatown?

MILES

Know it.

FAIT

Get there.

70.

TV ANCHOR (V.O.)

... And it looks like this chase will

end here, as police seal off the

building...

SU

Where is he?

ARCHIE

Decided to leave early.

SU

Where'd he go?

ARCHIE

Right here.

ARCHIE

Good thing I brought my stunner.

ARCHIE

Okay, bud, wanna start the Q and A?

71.

TV ANCHOR (V.O.)

... Here's a car coming down the exit

ramp...

TV ANCHOR (V.O.)

... The police apparently talking to

the driver...

TV ANCHOR (V.O.)

... Now letting this car drive on as

the search inside continues...

FAIT

I knew the stones were in there.

TOMMY

Question is, how do we get 'em out?

Place is slamming nonstop.

SU

Something isn't right.

72.

FAIT

Yeah.   That's what I'm getting.

SU

The doorman.

FAIT

... Where the hell is he?

(then)

Everyone stay put.

FAIT

No Chambers' guys.     I don't get it.

FAIT

I get it now.

FAIT

Are they there?

FAIT

No. This can't fucking happen.      They

gotta be there.

73.

FAIT

... What?     That's it?

SU

The rest are gone.

FAIT

... What the hell happened?        Who got

'em?

SU

... Ling.

FAIT

How do you know?

SU

I know.

FAIT

... How'd he get here before us?

SU

He's good.

FAIT

Vanessa...

(then, trying)

He has the stones. There's      no reason

to keep her. Hell, she's a      little

girl, she's eight years old     -- she

can't hurt him. He can let      her go...

He can just fucking let her     go...

FAIT

... What the hell am I gonna do?

SU

... We need to go.

74.

SU

Come on.

LING

We're back in business.

CHARLES

Good. I don't have to baby-sit much

longer.

SONA

I hate kids.

LING

Is everything else ready?

SONA

We just have to test the device.

RUSSELL

Dye master oscillator. And not test,

calibrate. Which I'm now ready to

do... Goggles.

75.

SU

... I lost the stones. Ling has

them... I don't know where he is... I

have no way to find him... What do

you want me to do?

VANESSA

... Answer, Daddy, answer...

MILES

Want me to get that?

MILES

Hello.

76.

VANESSA

Daddy?

FAIT

Vanessa!

VANESSA

Come get me!   Please!   I want to go

home!

FAIT

Okay, baby, okay. Just calm down.

SU

I'll call you back.

FAIT

(continuing, to

Vanessa)

Where are you?

VANESSA

I don't know. I'm in a van inside a

big building. They painted the

windows. I can't look out.

FAIT

Try.   Try to see something.

77.

VANESSA

I see chairs.    And there's green

light.

FAIT

You see chairs and green light?

Where's the light coming from?

VANESSA

I can't tell.

SU

Is it bright?

FAIT

The green light, baby -- is it

bright?

VANESSA

Yeah.   Really, really bright.

FAIT

(to Su)

It's real bright.

VANESSA

Daddy, hurry!    I'm scared!

FAIT

I know, baby.    Just hang in there

VANESSA

... Daddy?!   Daddy?!...

FAIT

... Vanessa?... Vanessa!... Shit!

SU

... He's doing it here.    Tonight.

78.

TOMMY

What?

SU

Selling the stones... A dye laser

emits green light. He needs it to

activate them.

MILES

What the hell you talking about?

DARIA

What are these stones?

ARCHIE

Doomsday in disguise.

ARCHIE

They're some kinda new synthetic

plutonium. Small and portable, but

mega-powerful.

TOMMY

This fucker's making bombs?

SU

Not making them.

ARCHIE

Yeah, he'd need a big operation for

that. Why bother? Just demonstrate

the stones work and sell 'em to

whichever international scumbag

offers the highest bid. He makes

millions, they make the bombs,

then... 'look out, world.'

FAIT

... Okay, so we know what he's up to.

How's it get us to Vanessa?

SU

The buyers will want to arrive and

leave quickly... Somewhere private...

Accessible by aircraft.

FAIT

Vanessa said she's inside a big

building. Could be a hangar.

79.

MILES

Man, there's dozens of little

airports around here. We'd never get

to 'em all.

SU

... Flight plans.

ARCHIE

Hey, yeah. Flight plans show

destinations. All aircraft file 'em

with the Aviation Administration. If

we could get a list, we could maybe

figure out where the sale's going

down.

FAIT

... Daria, call the aviation people.

Use our L.A.P.D. credentials. We

need flight plan info for all private

aircraft in this area tonight...

Everyone else get ready to move...

Miles, the no-gun policy's revoked.

You break out the heat... Tommy, you

gotta get us a diversion.

ARCHIE

I can help with that.

FAIT

... Do it all fast.

RUSSELL

We're operational.

SONA

The buyers arrive in less then an

hour.

LING

... So small. So deadly... We're

selling conscience for money...

80.

LING

... But it's a lot of money...

LING

Be ready to kill the girl and go as

soon as the sale's over.

FAIT (O.S.)

Wick Airfield...

FAIT

... Five private choppers arriving

tonight within minutes of each other.

DARIA

Sounds like our best shot.

FAIT

.. It better be, or my baby's dead.

FAIT

Let's go.

81.

FAIT (V.O.)

So tell me... How the hell's Taiwan

fit into all this?

SU (V.O.)

One of our scientists made the

stones. Tried to go into business

for himself. We stopped him.

Recovered the stones... Ling betrayed

us. He took them.

FAIT (V.O.)

Ling?   He was one of you?

SU (V.O.)

We were partners. Six of us. He

killed the others. He thought he

killed me, too.

FAIT (V.O.)

(beat)

So what're you really after -- the

stones or the payback?

SU

82.

Both.

FAIT (V.O.)

... Yeah... Let's get it all.

LING

You're the world's foremost arms

dealers. You all know that weaponry

equals power. And in the world of

weaponry, nukes rule.

(MORE)

LING (CONT'D)

But nuclear material is hard to

obtain and difficult to handle... But

what if it weren't?... That's the

question that brought you here

tonight... And here's the answer.

LING

In its present state, it's completely

inert. Zero radiation, zero

volatility...

RUSSELL

Goggles on.

RUSSELL

... Firecracker... .44 magnum...

R.P.G... Sidewinder... SCUD...

Tomahawk... Daisy Cutter...

Hiroshima... two Hiroshimas...

83.

RUSSELL

... New World Order.

RUSSELL

Goggles off.

LING

One small    fragment. Transformed into

a source    of immense energy. More

powerful    than weapons-grade plutonium

a hundred    times its size.

SONA

The purpose of today's sale is to

begin trading a new commodity on the

black market and establish its

value... There are fifty stones

available in the first sale. The

opening price is one million per

stone... Bids, please?

RUSSIAN BUYER

Five at one million.

AFRICAN BUYER

Five at one-point-two.

PAKISTANI BUYER

SONA

84.

We'll take that.

FRENCH BUYER

EGYPTIAN BUYER

FAIT

Miles, what do you see?

MILES (V.O.)

Two sentries my side.

MILES (V.O.)

Sale's at this end... There's a

camper with painted windows. Middle

of the hangar.

FAIT

Vanessa said she was in a van.

That's gotta be it.

(to Daria)

When we get her, you move her outta

85.

there fast.

DARIA

I'll keep her safe.

camper. Punch it.

PAKISTANI BUYER

Five at five million.

RUSSIAN BUYER

Six at five.

FRENCH BUYER

Seven at five.

AFRICAN BUYER

Ten at five.

EGYPTIAN BUYER

Ten at five-one.

FRENCH BUYER

Five-two.

TOMMY

Freeze, motherfuckers!

87.

RUSSELL

I knew it!   I knew it!

MILES (V.O.)

Vanessa's out of the camper.   Running

this way.

FAIT

Stay.

88.

MILES (V.O.)

She's out.

MILES (V.O.)

There's a guy after her.

TOMMY

Just be cool!

89.

TOMMY

I said don't move, motherfucker!

RUSSELL

Fucking amateurs!

TOMMY

Shit!   What do we do?

ARCHIE

Shoot back!

TOMMY

How?

ARCHIE

Twin .50's some major firepower.

How'd that little shit get one?

TOMMY

Motherfucker.    Couldn't fucking

listen.

90.

SU

Don't let him get away!

DARIA

Get him.

91.

MILES

Lost 'em behind the gas truck.

CHARLES

Time to end this my way.

FAIT (O.S.)

Drop the girl.

92.

FAIT

Put her down.

VANESSA

Daddy!

MILES

No shot.

93.

FAIT

Don't move.

FAIT

Wrong kid.    Wrong dad.

LING

Go!

94.

LING

Retract the gear!

SU

Shoot it down!   Now!

TOMMY

Can you hit it?

ARCHIE

No problem.   Absolutely... Load.

95.

TOMMY

Shot him right in the ass.

ARCHIE

I did it.   I can't believe it.

TOMMY

Thought you said it was no problem.

ARCHIE

What do I know?

LING

96.

You were lucky last time.   You

Won't be lucky again.

LING

I'll kill you fast.    You won't

Feel a thing.

SU

... I won't.    You will

SU

This is for our friends.

97.

FAIT

We got it all.

(then)

What happens to the stones?

SU

They'll be destroyed.

FAIT

Looks like I'll be doing some jail

time.

TOMMY

Jail? Man, you just helped save the

planet. Law's gotta allow for that.

SU

I'll do what I can.

ARCHIE

That's good, 'cause I mean, we make a

helluva team, y'know?

(to Su)

Well, not you, 'cause you're law

enforcement. But the rest of us

-- look, a white guy comes in handy

now and then. Y'know, if you're

pulling a job in Beverly Hills or

ripping off a country club or

whatever... What kind of percentage

are we talking?

98.

FAIT

We're not.

FAIT

Time I got real.

FAIT

Time we all did.

ARCHIE

Get real?    What's that mean?

TOMMY

... Means we're through with that

life.

DARIA

I'm with you, T.

MILES

Whatever you say, man.

SU

... Good luck.

FAIT

... Faith.

ARCHIE

What, you're all gonna go straight,

just like that?

TOMMY

Maybe oughta try it yourself.

ARCHIE

Me? Are you kidding? I've had

straight jobs. You ever had a

99.

straight job?

TOMMY

I had plenty of straight jobs.

ARCHIE

Name one.

TOMMY

I sold Avon door-to-door.

ARCHIE

... You were an Avon lady?

TOMMY

I was an Avon man. You got a problem

with that?

ARCHIE

No, it's just, well, uh...

TOMMY

Nah, I'm just fucking with you.

(then)

But my momma did it, and don't you

dare start disrespecting my momma...

FADE OUT:

THE END
