Hey, you peeping...

DISSOLVE TO:

SMALL MAN

What paper are you from?

MARK

I beg your pardon?

SMALL MAN

What paper are you from?

MARK

The Observer.

DISSOLVE TO:

MR. PETERS

You're late!

MARK

Sorry, sir.

MR. PETERS

(quietly)

Hold on, Mark.

MR. PETERS

Mark... I've a question for you.

MR. PETERS

Which magazines sell the most

copies?

MARK

Those with girls on the front covers -

and no front covers on the girls.

MR. PETERS

Exactly!... And it's just the same

with the work you do for me.

MR. PETERS

Look busy.

ELDERLY GENTLEMAN

The Times, please.

MR. PETERS

Certainly, sir.

ELDERLY GENTLEMAN

And The Telegraph.

MR. PETERS

Certainly, sir - anything else?

ELDERLY GENTLEMAN

I... er... have been told by a

friend that you... er... have some

views for sale?

MR. PETERS

What sort of views, sir?

ELDERLY GENTLEMAN

Well, er...

MR. PETERS

This sort, sir?

ELDERLY GENTLEMAN

I, er... how much each?

MR. PETERS

Five shillings, sir.

ELDERLY GENTLEMAN

I'll take this one... and, er...

this one... and, er... how much

would the lot be?

MR. PETERS

To you - five pounds, sir...

MR. PETERS

Tell you what, sir. Four pounds

ten - and I'll throw in The Times

and Telegraph... how's that?

ELDERLY GENTLEMAN

Well, er... thank you very much.

MR. PETERS

Let me wrap it for you, sir.

MR. PETERS

Shall I put you on our mailing

list?

ELDERLY GENTLEMAN

Oh no! But I'll look in again...

MR. PETERS

By all means, sir.

MR. PETERS

He won't be doing the crossword

tonight!

MR. PETERS

(counting out money

from wallet)

Those pictures he chose... were

all yours!

(handing notes)

This is yours!

MR. PETERS

(in a very different

tone)

And this is yours too...

MR. PETERS

And that's what I want to talk to

you about. It's a clever picture -

because you're a clever lad...

but, Mark...

(pathetically)

It's all face.

MR. PETERS

I don't want to hurt your feelings,

son - but if people want the Mona

Lisa they go to the National

Gallery.

MARK

The Louvre.

MR. PETERS

Well, wherever they go, they don't

come here... so no more of this

fancy stuff...

MR. PETERS

... now get upstairs - the girls

are waiting... and so is a bonus

if you give me what I want.

MARK

Thank you, sir.

MR. PETERS

(amused)

What do you do with all your money?

MARK

Buy cameras.

MILLY

Well look who's here! Cecil Beaton!

MILLY

Come on, sonny... make us famous.

MILLY (O.S.)

Did you read about that girl who

was murdered last night?

MILLY (O.S.)

The same thing nearly happened to

me!

LORRAINE (O.S.)

When?

MILLY (O.S.)

Last night! I went out with my

boyfriend... We're getting married

next month... trouble was my fiance

MILLY

show?

MILLY

Well, can you?

MARK

...think so, Milly.

MILLY

Then be quick about it, sonny! I'm

freezing.

MILLY

There he goes again! What have you

got under there? A girlfriend?

MILLY

I suppose you have a girlfriend?

MARK

No, Milly.

MILLY

Hear that, Lorraine? He's available.

MARK

Raise your head, please - and look

at the sea.

MILLY (O.S.)

What sea?

MILLY

What sea?

MARK

I just wanted that puzzled look.

MILLY (O.S.)

Oh, did you? Well if you want it

again, I'll think of you!

MILLY

You're a puzzle and a half.

MILLY

This is a spare time job for you,

isn't it?

MARK

Yes, Milly.

MILLY

Well, what do you do for a living?

MARK

Take pictures.

MILLY

This sort?

MARK

No, Milly.

MILLY

Don't you like this sort?

MARK

No, Milly.

MILLY

Well what sort do you like?

MARK

I may show you - one day.

MILLY

That'll be a treat, I'm sure.

MARK

That's all, Milly.

MILLY

Oh no, sonny! Now take one I can

show my mother.

MARK

Think of her then.

MR. PETERS

On the house.

MILLY

Some house! Hope it falls on his

ruddy earhole!

MILLY

It's your turn now, love...

MILLY (O.S.)

(in a whisper)

... it's her first time.

MILLY

Come on, love. Don't be shy.

LORRAINE

He said... you needn't photograph

my face!

MARK

I want to.

LORRAINE

I suppose you'll fix my bruises

too?

MARK

I want to...

MILLY

What about the customers?

MARK

You needn't be shy... of me...

it's my first time too.

LORRAINE

Yours?

MARK

In front of eyes... like...

YOUNG MAN

Look!

TONY (O.S.)

It's that chap from upstairs.

HELEN

I'll ask him in...

HELEN (O.S.)

Excuse me!

I don't know how many times we've

passed each other on the stairs?

HELEN

... but tonight I'm determined at

least to say hello to you! So hello!

HELEN

I'm Helen Stephens.

HELEN

I'm having a party - and the other

tenants are there...  And a few

friends. We'd like you to join us.

MARK

Mark...

HELEN

Pardon?

MARK

I'm Mark...

HELEN

Hallo, Mark.

HELEN

Please come in... you'll meet the

others who live here, and...

MARK

Thank you, but... work.

HELEN

Oh...

HELEN

Well, I hope to keep it going for

hours yet... so when you've finished

why not look in?

HELEN

...Mark?

TONY

Darling, your cake - everyone's

waiting.

MARK

Thank you.

MARK

Happy Birthday.

FADE OUT:

MARK (O.S.)

...minute...

HELEN

I hope I'm not disturbing you?

HELEN

I knew you wouldn't come down...

so I've brought you this.

MARK

Thank you...

MARK

... very much...

HELEN

I mustn't keep you from your work

MARK

I'd like to offer you a drink.

HELEN

Thank you, Mark.

MARK

I haven't one.

HELEN

I'd adore some water.

HELEN

a hostess can't drink water at her

own party, it looks like a hint to

the guests.

MARK

Will you... would you... like to

come in?

HELEN

Yes, Mark...

MARK (O.S.)

There's milk... if you'd like some?

HELEN

Very much... if you can spare it?

MARK (O.S.)

Yes.

HELEN

Thank you, Mark...

HELEN

This is a pleasant room... and

you've another inside?

MARK

Yes.

HELEN

How long have you lived here?

MARK

All my life.

MARK

I was born in this house Oh?

MARK

It's my father's.

HELEN

Do you mean I've at last found out

who our landlord is? Your father?

MARK

Well - no... he's dead!

MARK

I'm the landlord.

HELEN

YOU?

MARK

Yes.

HELEN

But you walk about as if you haven't

paid the rent.

MARK

I haven't.

HELEN

I meant...

MARK

I know.

MARK

It's his house - and I'll never

sell it... but I can't afford the

upkeep, so I let rooms.

MARK

... if I charge too much, tell me

and I'll tell the agents.

HELEN

The rent's very reasonable, but

don't say anything to the others

or you'll have no peace.

MARK

Peace...?

HELEN

Mark, what do you do?

MARK

(slowly)

Most of the time, I work in a film

studio.

HELEN

On the photographic side, I'll

bet.

MARK

I hope to be a film director...

very soon.

HELEN

How exciting.

MARK

I have some spare time jobs... as

well.

HELEN

To do with photography?

MARK

More milk?

HELEN

No thank you... to do with

photography?

MARK

Yes... to do with photography...

HELEN

When I came in were you looking at

some films?

MARK

Yes.

HELEN

Of yours?

MARK

Yes.

HELEN

I'd like to see them...

HELEN

Know I'm being rude... but I really

would like to see them...

(she smiles.)

...it would be a birthday present...

from you to me.

MARK

Would it?

HELEN

Yes, Mark.

MARK

Oh...

HELEN

But I suppose you're too busy?

MARK

Will you... would you... like to

see them now?

HELEN

Thank you...

MARK

I'll... go first.

HELEN

This is so... well - so many

things... but above all - it's

so...

HELEN

...completely unexpected!

HELEN

Is all of it yours?

MARK

Yes.

HELEN

I mean... is it designed by you?

Furnished by you? Tell me about

this room.

MARK

It belonged to my father

HELEN

What was he?

MARK

Scientist...

HELEN

Then this equipment was his?

MARK

No...

MARK

Sold his to buy it...

HELEN

But it seems to be so... technical.

HELEN

If this is where you work, I can't

wait to see what you work at.

MARK

Don't know what to show you?

HELEN

Well... what were you looking at

when I interrupted you?

MARK

All right!

MARK

This is the first... twenty-first

birthday present... I'll ever have

given.

HELEN

It's the first I've ever asked

for...

HELEN

Mark, what a beautiful child.

HELEN

Who is he?

MARK

Me

HELEN

Of course it is!  Then who took

this film?

MARK

(quietly)

My Father.

HELEN

What a wonderful idea...

HELEN

You'll be able to show it to your

own chi...

HELEN

You must have had a bad dream...

HELEN

...but what was that light?  ...The

camera, I suppose?

HELEN

Whatever are you after?

HELEN

Naughty boy I hope you were spanked!

HELEN

... but, Mark... what a strange

thing for your father to photograph.

MARK

Switch off?

HELEN

No.

HELEN

No.

DISSOLVE TO:

MRS. STEPHENS

Tony!

TONY

Me, Mrs. Stephens?

MRS. STEPHENS

I want a word with you.

DISSOLVE TO:

HELEN

I hate people who chatter in films -

but there's so much I want to ask.

HELEN

(in a whisper)

Again?

HELEN

Mark, this isn't some kind of jo...

MARK

(in a whisper)

No, Helen.

HELEN

Mark, whatever is that?

HELEN

What are you...

MARK

wanted to photograph you...

watching...

HELEN

No, Mark!

HELEN

No!

HELEN

help me to understand this... this

nightmare...

MAN'S DEEP VOICE (O.S.)

That'll do Mark... dry your eyes

and stop being silly.

HELEN

All right... now look... Mark -

what was all that about?

HELEN

... that was a lizard, wasn't it?

Or a...

MARK

Liz...

HELEN

Well how did it get there?... How

did it get there Mark?...  Was it

a pet?

MARK

Not mine...

HELEN

Won't you try to explain?

MARK

You'd better go!

HELEN

I like to understand what I'm shown!

HELEN

What was your father trying to

do?... Photographing you at nigh...

MARK

better go...

HELEN

Mark... what is this?

MARK

I am saying... goodbye... my

mother...

HELEN

(in a whisper)

He... photographed... that...?

MARK

Yes.

MARK

...and this!

MARK

...her funeral!

MARK

...and this!

MARK

...her burial!

MARK

...and this!

HELEN

Mark, who is that?

MARK

Her successor.

HELEN

Suc-?

MARK

He married her... six weeks after...

the previous sequence.

MARK

She filmed... what comes now.

HELEN

Is that your father?

MARK

The morning that he left for his

honeymoon.

HELEN

What is he doing?

MARK

Giving me a present...

HELEN

What was it?

MARK

Can't you guess?

MARK (O.S.)

A camera...

HELEN

Switch it off!

HELEN

Switch it off, Mark!

HELEN

So he was a scientist?

HELEN

What kind of scientist, Mark?

MARK

Biologist.

HELEN

What was he trying to do to you?

HELEN

Mark!...

HELEN

What was he trying to do to you?

MARK

Watch me... grow up...

MARK

He wanted a record of a growing

child... complete in every detail -

if such a thing were possible -

and he tried to make it possible

by training a camera on me... at

all times...

MARK

I never knew... the whole of my

childhood... one moment's privacy...

HELEN

And those lights in your eyes?...

and that - thing?

MARK

He was interested ... in the

reactions of the nervous system...

to fear...  Fear?

HELEN

Fear?

MARK

Fear.

MARK (O.S.)

Especially fear in children - and

how they react to it.

MARK

I think he learned a lot... from

me... I'd wake up... screaming...

sometimes... and he'd be there...

taking notes... and pictures...

and I'm sure good came of it...

for some people... He was brilliant.

HELEN

A scientist drops a lizard onto a

child's bed - and good comes of

it?

MARK

I don't know... if he did... but

if he did... he'll have learned

something of value...

HELEN

If only about lizards!  Mark - it

sounds to me as if your father

was...

MARK

He founded clinics.

HELEN

He sounds completely...

MARK

He was famous! Professor A. N.

Lewis... three clinics.

HELEN

Why do you still live in his

house... and watch his films?

MARK

They helped make me... what I am.

HELEN

A photographer? It's no wonder, is

it? But you still haven't shown me

anything you've photographed!

HELEN

Will you?

MARK

One day...

TONY

Excuse me, but...

TONY

Oh, there you are, Helen.

TONY

The party looks like breaking up,

and we were wondering if...

HELEN

I'm coming.

HELEN

I wish you'd join us.

MARK

Thanks... work.

HELEN

I hope that you...

HELEN

... have a sweet tooth!

HELEN

Thank you... for my present.

TONY

Good night, old boy.

DISSOLVE TO:

VIVIAN

Mark?

MARK

Hallo...

VIVIAN

Were you spotted?

MARK

Don't think so.

VIVIAN

(switches off music)

Is it tonight?

MARK

Yes.

VIVIAN

Mark...

MARK

Yes?

VIVIAN

You're sure we won't be caught?

MARK

Not if you do as I tell you.

VIVIAN

I will, I promise.

MARK

You haven't... said anything... to

anyone?

VIVIAN

Of course not.

MARK

Good... like some cake?

VIVIAN

Thank you.

VIVIAN

Mark... I want to be quite clear

about this...

VIVIAN

Tonight, when the studio's empty...

I'm to come back-and you're going

to give me a film test... right?

MARK

Right.

VIVIAN

You'll then print the film - so I

can show it to my agent and anyone

else who matters - right?

MARK

Right.

VIVIAN

Mark...

VIVIAN

I've been offered film tests

before... but I haven't liked the

terms.

MARK

There aren't any.

VIVIAN

Then why are you doing this? Risking

your job and...

MARK

Not just for you... Viv... I have

an agent too - and I want to show

him what I can do... I want to

direct...

VIVIAN

(switching on music

again)

There's someone coming.

EXTRA

Hallo - lousy morning's work, wasn't

it?

VIVIAN

Yes.

EXTRA

Thought I saw you talking to

somebody...

VIVIAN

I was learning my lines.

EXTRA

Didn't know you had any...

EXTRA

Want a drink? Dutch?

VIVIAN

Later... perhaps.

EXTRA

Be seeing you

VIVIAN

Mark...

MARK

Yes?

VIVIAN

(switching off music

again)

You didn't mind me asking?

MARK

No, more cake?

VIVIAN

No... you want to direct... more

badly than anything don't you?

VIVIAN

Don't you, Mark?

MARK

I want... to photograph... the

impossible...

VIVIAN

What is impossible?

MARK

Something... that has never been

photographed before.

VIVIAN

What?

MARK

You really want to know...?

VIVIAN

Very much, especially if there's a

part for me.

MARK

I want... to photograph a murder...

while it's being committed.

VIVIAN

No part for me then.

MARK

But that... isn't enough.

VIVIAN

Is this a new script?

MARK

I want... to frighten... someone...

to death... and photograph... their

expression of fear...

VIVIAN

Mark! What's this story called?

MARK

That is something... he never

photographed...

VIVIAN

Who?

VIVIAN

Who is he, Mark?

MARK

Anyone.

VIVIAN

No one could... they'd be caught!

MARK

I wouldn't care... if I had my

picture.

VIVIAN

Besides, how would you frighten

anyone to death?

MARK

There's a way.

VIVIAN

Well, what?

MARK

There's a way.

VIVIAN

You'd better not tell me! I'll be

scared to death tonight as it is!

VIVIAN

Back on the set - shall I go first?

MARK

Please.

VIVIAN

What are you doing?

MARK

Getting into practice.

VIVIAN

See you tonight!

MARK

See you tonight!

DISSOLVE TO:

BADEN

Would you enquire if our leading

lady is ready to start leading.

ASSISTANT (O.S.)

Miss Diane Ashley, please!...

Hallo, Diane...

Hallo, Diane...

DIANE

How are you, Phil?... Mark?

MARK

Hallo, Miss Ashley.

DIANE

(to a figure high

in the scaffolding)

How are you, Pete...?

VOICE

Hi, Di!

BADEN

Darling, you've only been playing

this part for three weeks, so in

case you haven't yet had a chance

to read the script...

BADEN

... may I remind you that you're a

girl with an irresistible impulse!

BADEN

a kleptomaniac! Who cannot help

stealing... Get inside her,

Diane!... What - in all the world -

do you most want to steal?

DIANE

The limelight!

BADEN

We'll run the scene where you catch

sight of the store detective and

faint... Where's the girl who plays

the bystander?

BADEN

How are you?

VIVIAN

Hallo, Diane...

1ST ASSISTANT

Positions, everyone!

BADEN

Hit that floor with a thud!

BADEN (O.S.)

D.J. insists on realism!

VOICE (O.S. FILTERED)

...it's a wonderful subject, D.J....

Paramount wants it, M.G.M. wants

it, Columbia wants it.

JARVIS

But is it commercial?

VOICE (O.S. FILTERED)

Danny Angel wants it!

JARVIS

Are those budgets ready? Well bring

'em in.

VOICE (O.S. FILTERED)

Send me a memo - we'll discuss it

next week.

JARVIS

There's an error!  The total should

be a hundred and fifty thousand

pounds fourteen shillings and

sixpence - not thirteen and

ninepence... That could mean the

difference between profit and loss

on a first feature!

MISS SIMPSON

Sorry, D.J.

JARVIS

Any units working late tonight?

MISS SIMPSON

Only one, sir. Night exteriors on

the lot. The Elephant with two...

JARVIS

That animal needs a stick of

dynamite!

JARVIS

Remind me to pay them a visit

tonight.

MISS SIMPSON

Yes, D.J.

JARVIS

Now, Miss Simpson... take a memo

to all department heads...

JARVIS (O.S.)

In light of the new economy drive...

DISSOLVE TO:

BADEN

Again, please... and, darling...

BADEN

please make an effort to forget

that you're stunning, and try to

look as if you're stunned...?

DIANE

Say one kind word - and I would

be!

ASSISTANT

Positions, everyone!

DISSOLVE TO:

DIANE

If I have to faint once more I

shall faint!

DISSOLVE TO:

Cut! How was that?...

with one exception)

Mark?

BADEN

Print it!

ASSISTANT

That's it, boys and girls . . .

wrap it up! Night-night everyone!

Baden puts his arm round Diane's

shoulder.

BADEN

How are you, darling?

CLAPPER BOY

Catching the bus?

MARK

Not tonight... meeting someone...

for a drink.

CLAPPER BOY

Wanted to discuss the film at the

Everyman... Tomorrow then?

MARK

I hope so.

CLAPPER BOY

Good night, Mark.

MARK

Good night.

DISSOLVE TO:

Greetings... lousy afternoon's

work, wasn't it? Who wants a lift

1ST GIRL

In what?

EXTRA

colleague's car... there's room

pinch.

1ST GIRL

Which is what we'd get.

2ND GIRL

You, Viv?

VIVIAN

No, thanks... I've a date... at

the Local.

1ST GIRL

Us two then?

2ND GIRL

I'm game... might as well get

pinched in a car as squeezed in a

tube.

MISS SIMPSON

I'm to remind you to pay a surprise

visit tonight to The Elephant

VIVIAN

Listen... we must...

VIVIAN

Where are you?

MARK (O.S.)

Here, Viv...

VIVIAN

You frightened me!

VIVIAN

Now listen... they're working late

on the lot.

MARK

I know. They're branched off this

stage - I'm using their juice.

VIVIAN

We must call it off... someone's

bound to see us.

MARK

They might...

(rising slowly)

... but they won't interrupt us

while we're filming... I've put

the red light on.

VIVIAN

You've what?...

MARK

Put the...

VIVIAN

Then they'll know someone's here.

MARK

They won't come in.

VIVIAN

They'll wait outside... what's the

difference?

MARK

The difference is... a perfect

film...

MARK

... have waited... a long time...

for this... and so have you ... no

one... must interrupt it.

VIVIAN

We'll be caught.

MARK

What does that matter?

VIVIAN

Matter!

MARK

You stand to lose... a job as an

extra... I stand to lose... nothing.

MARK

...the results must be so perfect...

that the risks don't count...

MARK

So perfect... that even he ...

(he hesitates)

... even he... would say...

VIVIAN

Who Don Jarvis!?

VIVIAN

Oh! He'd say:

(imitating the great

man's voice)

Sign on the dotted line, kiddies!

You can use my pen, but bring your

own ink!

(her excitement is

growing)

Mark... if you're sure it's worth

it?

MARK

It's time to find out, Viv...

VIVIAN

Come on! Get hot!

(she accents the

rhythm)

MARK

You belong there...

VIVIAN

I do feel alone in front of it...

(she hesitates)

I suppose stars never do?

MARK

They feel alone without it...

(he looks in the

eyepiece)

MARK

... and the great ones... feel

alone... all the time...

VIVIAN

Then I'm great, boy! What is it

you want me to act?

(she strikes an

attitude a, la

Rabbins)

VIVIAN

Being frightened to death?

MARK

You remembered?

VIVIAN

Yes - and I'll have a go!

VIVIAN

I've been wondering all the

afternoon how you'd do it!  I'll

bet you've thought of a wonderful

twist!

(she does a wonderful

twist)

VIVIAN

What are you doing?

MARK

Building us a set.

VIVIAN

Why not pull the studio down while

you're about it? They can only

hang you once.

MARK

Exactly.

VIVIAN

If only Don Jarvis could see me

now!

VIVIAN

If only I could see Don Jarvis

now!

VIVIAN

I warn you, Mark - I'm hysterical...

I'd rather act dying of laughter,

if it's all the same to you...

DISSOLVE TO:

1ST ELECTRICIAN

So he did it again! Now you tell

one.

2ND ELECTRICIAN

Half a mo...

1ST ELECTRICIAN (O.S.)

One lump or two?

2ND ELECTRICIAN

As the starlet said to the casting

director...

DISSOLVE TO:

VIVIAN

(to Mark, over her

shoulder)

What are you doing?

MARK

Be patient, Viv... it's going to

be worth it.

VIVIAN

Oh well! I've stood alone in front

of a studio camera! That's more

than most have.

MARK

Ever stood... behind one?

VIVIAN

No.

MARK

Help yourself.

VIVIAN

(accenting the rhythm)

I can see you, Mark... perfectly!

MARK

Good...

VIVIAN

Yes, sir! I'll bet I'm the best

camerawoman in the business! . . .

(beating time with

her feet)

VIVIAN (O.S.)

I've lost you!

MARK

I'll be back.

VIVIAN

Welcome, stranger!

VIVIAN

What are you doing?

MARK

Photographing you photographing

me...

VIVIAN

(in mock awe)

Mark, you're brilliant...

VIVIAN

Lost you again!

MARK (O.S.)

Never mind.

MARK

I'm ready now, Viv...

MARK

Go and stand on that cross, will

you?

VIVIAN

(solemnly)

Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.

DISSOLVE TO:

1ST ELECTRICIAN (O.S.)

...and here's one of the wife and

nipper...

DISSOLVE TO:

VIVIAN

Am I supposed to imagine someone

is going to put me in there?

MARK

Yes, Viv...

VIVIAN

Mark - I hope I won't let you

down... I know you're trying to

create atmosphere for me - but...

I just don't feel frightened!

Wouldn't it be better if I just

did my number?

MARK

(shaking head)

Later.

VIVIAN

Oh all right! I could do anything -

I feel so relaxed - and that's due

to you... You're so at home with

that camera you make me feel at

home too... you have it in you,

boy!

MARK

Ready, Viv?

MARK VIVIAN

(great effort)

Well-I'll try -

MARK VIVIAN

But what... would... frighten me

to death?

(looking appealingly

into camera)

Set the mood for me, Mark...

MARK

Well...

MARK

Imagine someone... coming towards

you... who's going to kill you -

regardless of consequences...

VIVIAN

A madman?

MARK

Yes - but he knows it... and you

don't... and just to kill you...

isn't enough for him.

VIVIAN

But how would he frighten me to?

MARK

Stay there, Viv... you're... just

right.

VIVIAN

I can't imagine what you've thought

of!

MARK (O.S.)

Suppose this... were one of his

weapons...

JARVIS

Smoking on duty!

JARVIS

Come with me!

VIVIAN

That..?

VIVIAN

Yes... that would be frightening!

MARK

But... there's something else...

VIVIAN

Well? What is it?

VIVIAN

(in a whisper)

That...?

VIVIAN

(in a whisper)

Mark... take it...

VIVIAN

... away!

VIVIAN

MARK - YOU!

HELEN'S VOICE (O.S.)

And that, darling, is the end of

the news! Unless you want the

football results?

MRS. STEPHENS

No thank you.

HELEN

What else can I read you?

MRS. STEPHENS

The label on this whisky bottle!

Are you sure it says seventy per

cent proof?

HELEN

Certain.

MRS. STEPHENS

They're bigger liars than the press!

HELEN

Is that your last tonight?

MRS. STEPHENS

I doubt it.

HELEN

Your last but one?

MRS. STEPHENS

Don't haggle.

HELEN

(producing a coin)

Toss me double or nothing?

MRS. STEPHENS

Done!

MRS. STEPHENS

Heads.

HELEN

Bad luck, darling.

MRS. STEPHENS

Huh.

MRS. STEPHENS

What are you looking at?

HELEN

The ceiling!

MRS. STEPHENS

Wondering if that young man is

home?

HELEN

Yes.

MRS. STEPHENS

Well he is... I heard him come

in... four paragraphs ago.

MRS. STEPHENS

Do you like him?

HELEN

Yes, darling.

MRS. STEPHENS

Why?

HELEN

He has a quality...

MRS. STEPHENS

(sipping her glass)

Wish this had.

HELEN

... and I think he could help me.

MRS. STEPHENS

With your photographs?

HELEN

Yes...

MRS. STEPHENS

Helen...

HELEN

Yes?

MRS. STEPHENS

(abruptly)

It doesn't matter.

HELEN

(quickly)

Mummy, what's worrying you?

MRS. STEPHENS

The price of whisky.

HELEN

What else?

MRS. STEPHENS

What else matters?

HELEN

Don't you like Mark?

MRS. STEPHENS

Haven't met him.

HELEN

You don't like him! Now why not?

MRS. STEPHENS

I distrust a man who walks quietly.

HELEN

He's shy!

MRS. STEPHENS

His footsteps aren't! They're

stealthy...

HELEN

Now darling.

MRS. STEPHENS

Are you going up to him?

HELEN

May I?

MRS. STEPHENS

We both have the key of the door...

Mine needs oiling - and yours needs

exercise... Off you go.

HELEN

Thank you.

HELEN

remember that you lost the toss.

MRS. STEPHENS

Helen...

HELEN

Yes, darling?

MRS. STEPHENS

If you're back in five minutes...

I won't even finish this.

HELEN

Done!

MARK

Who is it?

HELEN (O.S.)

Helen...

MARK

(calling)

Come in, Helen!

MARK (O.S.)

Would you... please... wait in

there?... Developing.

HELEN

Mother heard you come in - so I

guessed you wouldn't be in bed ...

HELEN

Are you sure this is conven...

MARK (O.S.)

Won't be long!

MARK (O.S.)

Hallo.

HELEN

Hallo, Mark...

HELEN

I hope you don't mind - is it a

tape-recorder?

MARK

Yes.

HELEN

I'm sure I'm being a nuisance...

but, Mark, I very much want to...

MARK

Happy birthday.

HELEN

Mark! That's very sweet of you -

but really.

MARK

It isn't much... I don't know

anything about... presents for

twenty-one... but I saw it this

morning... so... please.

HELEN

(gently)

Thank you...

HELEN

It's beautiful...

MARK

I like the design... More milk?

HELEN

More?... No, thank you, Mark...

and I really appreciate this...

I'm going to put it on now.

HELEN

There?... Or there?...

MARK

The first place...

HELEN

I think so too!...

HELEN

I am keeping you.

MARK

No... I promise.

HELEN

Mark, I'm here for some advice.

MARK

From me?  Please...

HELEN

... I work in a public library -

in the children's section... I'm

telling you that to postpone

admitting what always embarrasses

me...

HELEN

In my spare time... I write.

MARK

What's embar...

HELEN

I write stories for children...

but so did Grimm... Hans Andersen...

Lewis Carroll...

MARK

Had any published?

HELEN

Some short stories.

MARK

I'd like to read...

HELEN

I learned today... that my first

book... has been accepted! ... For

publication in the spring...

MARK

But that's wonderful... what's it

about?

HELEN

A magic camera - and what it

photographs...

MARK

Whatever made you... think of that?

HELEN

I'll tell you one day - I promise...

MARK

Well what does it photograph?

HELEN

I'll tell you that too - but,

Mark... this is the problem... The

children who read the book will

want to see the pictures the camera

takes - but the publishers say

they're impossible to photograph,

and suggest drawings... but I don't

agree.

MARK

No - nothing's impossible.

HELEN

was hoping you'd say that! There

must be photographs - however

difficult to take - and I was

wondering, Mark - if you'd...

MARK

Oh yes.

HELEN

discuss it with me.

MARK

take them.

HELEN

Mark - I can't ask you to do that...

HELEN

I mean... the publisher's mightn't

agree.

MARK

I'd take them... for you.

HELEN

Yes but... the money.

MARK

There are some things... which I

photograph... for nothing.

HELEN

I didn't mean to offend you.

MARK

Offend?

MARK

Helen... if you knew what it

meant... for something to happen

to me... that I don't have to make

happen... it's like... you've given

me a twenty-first birthday...

MARK

What does your camera photograph?

HELEN

Mark - I must go... I just wanted

to know... if you'd talk it over

with me.

MARK

When please?

HELEN

That's up to you.

MARK

Helen ... I don't know much about...

dinner out... but would you come

with me?

HELEN

Thank you.

MARK

Thank you.

HELEN

When?

MARK

Oh...

HELEN

What's the matter?

MARK

It had better be soon...

HELEN

Are you going away?

MARK

Almost for certain! ...

HELEN

Oh... well you suggest when.

MARK

Are you free... tomorrow night?

HELEN

Yes.

MARK

I hope I am!

HELEN

I'll understand if you're not.

MARK

I'll try to be - I'll try my hardest

to be.

HELEN

Thank you for listening... and for

my present.

MARK

and for mine.

HELEN

Good night, Mark...

(turning to the

door)

MARK

Good night... Helen...

MAN'S VOICE

Looking for a trunk?

DIANE (O.S.)

I'd like to see that one.

BADEN

No - no - no - we must get some

comedy into this...!

BADEN

We'll retake it this morning...

DIANE

(she pockets a small

item)

I'll take it.

DISSOLVE TO:

BADEN

I want some comedy in this scene...

BADEN

Instead of taking the first trunk

you see, I want you, darling... to

ask for a blue trunk - and when he

brings it to you, to ask for a red

one - and when he brings that, to

ask for a white one...

(turns to the

Assistant)

And you, Michael... get the trunks

one by one - growing more and more

fed up - and we'll end on a gag

which I'll think of in a minute -

all right?

DIANE

I don't feel it!

BADEN

Don't feel it! Do it!

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

(hastily)

Positions, everyone!

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

Anyone seen Vivian?

BADEN

Who?

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

The red-headed bystander - Viv.

BADEN

(impatiently)

Never mind - I'm cutting her out

of this scene... Let's run it.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

(shouting)

Quiet, everyone!

ASSISTANT

Can I interest you in a trunk?

DIANE

Thank you...

(pointing)

I'd like to see that one...

ASSISTANT

Certainly, madam...

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

It's beautifully fitted -

(he opens it)

DIANE

I'd like to see one in red.

ASSISTANT

Certainly, madam.

DIANE

... do you have one in white?

ASSISTANT

Certainly, madam.

DIANE (O.S.)

Do you have one in blue?

ASSISTANT (O.S.)

Certainly, madam...

BADEN

The silly bitch! She's fainted in

the wrong scene...

FADE OUT:

HEAD OF PUBLICITY

is this a gag?... A girl in a

trunk!... Who is she?... Well,

which unit?... The walls are closing

in?... What a break for them!... I

mean what a heartbreak!

(he is already

speaking into

another telephone)

call a press conference.

(he turns to the

original telephone)

I'm on my way down!

SERGEANT MILLER

Excuse me, Chief.

CHIEF INSPECTOR

Mm?

SERGEANT MILLER

We pass my house when we reach the

bypass. Would you mind if I drop

off for a minute?

CHIEF INSPECTOR

(without raising

his eyes)

To collect your kid's autograph

book?

SERGEANT MILLER

Yes, Chief!... If the nipper hears

where I've been...

CHIEF INSPECTOR

(turns to the driver)

All right, Dawson - anything to

help the Sergeant...

(stares down at the

folder)

... and it's about time the Sergeant

helped me - we're getting nowhere

with this.

SERGEANT

What about that man the landlady

passed?

CHIEF INSPECTOR

She couldn't describe him - except

to say that he was carrying

something that she couldn't see.

SERGEANT

That's a help.

CHIEF INSPECTOR

Sergeant, I've been on the force

thirty odd years... and I have

never seen such fear on anyone's

face as on this girl's...

(almost to himself)

What was it she saw?

SERGEANT

Surely, Chief... a man coming at

her - with a sharp weapon.

CHIEF INSPECTOR

I'm familiar with that kind of

terror. This is something new to

me... but what?

CHIEF INSPECTOR

...now take a look at how we found

her.

DISSOLVE TO:

GIRL (O.S.)

How much longer must we wait in

here?

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

Till the police arrive... D.J.'s

orders.

ASSISTANT

and when she opened that trunk...

and I saw what was inside... my

dears - I nearly fainted with her -

(he runs a delicate

hand across a

delicate forehead)

and do you know what horrified me

most?

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

D.J. says not to discuss it.

ASSISTANT

Any more sauce from D.J. and I

shall refuse to sign for seven

years! My dears... that poor girl's

expression.

DISSOLVE TO:

SERGEANT

(in a whisper)

Chief, it's exactly the...

INSPECTOR

I know...

(he closes the trunk

quickly. Quietly)

... don't say anything.

(he faces Don Jarvis)

Well, sir... we shall probably

have to interview everyone at the

studio, so we'd better plan a

campaign that won't interfere too

much with your productions.

JARVIS

(warming to him at

once)

Thank you, Chief Inspector... if

you knew what even a single day's

delay could cost.

INSPECTOR

Oh, we do sir.

(his eyes are on

the trunk)

DISSOLVE TO:

JARVIS (O.S.)

If I may have your attention,

please.

JARVIS

The police wish to interview each

of you individually... after which

you will be at liberty to leave.

JARVIS

There will, of course, be no

shooting today... but work will be

resumed, as usual, tomorrow...

with, I hope, all of you present.

JARVIS

I look to you to give the police

your fullest cooperation.

(he turns abruptly

and leaves')

SERGEANT MILLER

Well now... let's get ourselves

organized...

(taking a piece of

paper from his

pocket)

We don't want to keep you cooped

up in here, so we've worked out a

timetable... We'll talk to the

artists first, then the technicians

in this order...

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

EXTRA

...she said she didn't want a lift -

because she had a call to make

locally.

CHIEF INSPECTOR

Did she say where?

EXTRA

No, sir... and when I left, she

was still in the dressing room.

CHIEF INSPECTOR

I see... let's have a look at this

dressing room, shall we?

EXTRA

Yes, sir ...

GIRL

Hallo, Mark...

MARK (O.S.)

Hallo.

SERGEANT

Hey, I don't think you ought to do

that!

MARK

Sorry, sir.

INSPECTOR

(turning round)

Do what?

SERGEANT

Make me famous. Some chap was giving

me a screen test

EXTRA (O.S.)

That's where she sat.  Inspector.

DISSOLVE TO:

VOICE

And whoever did it must be...

CHIEF CAMERAMAN

You're next.

CLAPPER BOY

I've been watching you...

MARK

Oh?

CLAPPER BOY

Have you been filming those

policemen?

MARK

Yes, I've a few quite interesting

shots of them - it's a chance I

never expected!

CLAPPER BOY

A chance for what?

MARK

To photograph... an investigation...

or as much of it as I can.

CLAPPER BOY

What on earth for?

MARK

It will complete a documentary I'm

making.

CLAPPER BOY

documentary?

CLAPPER BOY

What's it about?

MARK

I'd rather not tell you till it's

finished. And it soon will be ...

CLAPPER BOY

But suppose they catch you?

MARK

Oh they will - they look very

efficient.

CLAPPER BOY

Don't you mind?

MARK

No.

CLAPPER BOY

But they might confiscate your

camera.

MARK

I'm afraid they will! But by then...

I'll have finished with it.

CLAPPER BOY

I don't...

CREW-MEMBER

You, Mark?

MARK

Thanks...

CLAPPER BOY

Mark, hadn't you better leave that

with me?

MARK

No, John.

CLAPPER BOY

I'd look after it.

MARK

I'm sure of that - but I'd like to

photograph them while they're

questioning me.

MARK

I don't suppose they'll let me.

CLAPPER BOY

Mark, are you potty?

MARK

Yes, do you think they'll notice?

CLAPPER BOY

Don't get into any trouble for

heaven's sake  I want to discuss

that film at the Everyman...

MARK

Yes... I'd like that...

SERGEANT

Mark Lewis - focus-puller...

Whatever that may be?

SERGEANT

Come in.

INSPECTOR

Mr. Lewis?

MARK

Yes, sir...

INSPECTOR

I'm Chief Inspector Gregg and this

is Sergeant Miller. Grab a chair.

SERGEANT

Ah! My photographer.

MARK

I've brought the camera in case

you want to take the film away.

INSPECTOR

That's all right, Mr. Lewis - as

long as we don't appear at the

Odeon next week in place of the

cartoon.

MARK

Thank you, sir.

INSPECTOR

Well now; have you anything to

tell us?

MARK

Don't think so, sir.

INSPECTOR

Did you know the girl?

MARK

Yes, sir...

INSPECTOR

How well?

MARK

Mainly by sight.

INSPECTOR

When did you see her last?

MARK

Yesterday afternoon - when we

broke...

INSPECTOR

Speak to her?

MARK

Called out good night - don't know

if she heard?

INSPECTOR

What did you do then?

MARK

Took sqme shots, sir - for a film

I'm making.

INSPECTOR

Oh... where?

MARK

All over the place, sir... it's a

documentary.

INSPECTOR

Anyone with you?

MARK

No, sir. Just my camera.

INSPECTOR

What time did you arrive home, Mr.

Lewis?

MARK

About ten... ten-thirty...

INSPECTOR

Anyone see you?

MARK

Yes... the people downstairs.

INSPECTOR

I see.

SERGEANT

Sergeant Miller - Right, I'll tell

him...

SERGEANT

The doctor's finished his examin...

SERGEANT

...wants to see you -

INSPECTOR

Right.

(he glances at Mark)

That'll be all for the moment, Mr.

Lewis - thank you.

MARK

(he turns to the

door)

Thank you, sir ...

INSPECTOR

Wait a minute.

INSPECTOR

direct me to that set of yours,

will you? I'd probably end on

location.

MARK

I'll take you there, sir.

(he opens the door)

INSPECTOR

Thanks.

(he glances at the

Sergeant)

Carry on with the interviews,

Sergeant.

SERGEANT

Yes, sir.

CLAPPER BOY

(staring after them)

I warned him to be careful!

DISSOLVE TO:

INSPECTOR

I think I can find my way now...

INSPECTOR

...thanks for the escort

DISSOLVE TO:

DOCTOR (O.S.)

No doubt at all... wounds were

caused by the same instrument...

DOCTOR (O.S.)

... both women... subjected to the

most violent shock...

INSPECTOR (O.S.)

What sort of shock?

DOCTOR

...still cannot determine - but

look!

INSPECTOR

Quiet, everyone.  Please...

DETECTIVE

I thought I heard a putty cat!

INSPECTOR

I don't want to spoil anyone's

fun, but we do have a maniac on

our hands, and if we don't get him

quickly there'll be a third unsolved

murder to report to the

Commissioner. So let's hurry things

up, shall we?

DETECTIVE

Sorry, Chief!

HELEN

she was appearing in Arthur Baden's

new film The Walls Are Closing In,

starring Diane Ashley.

HELEN

a spokesman at the studio said

that her performance in the film

showed such promise, that her role

was to have been built up... All

work at the studio ceased today as

a tribute to her memory!

MRS. STEPHENS

Mark is in films, isn't he?

HELEN

Yes, darling... It is reliably...

MRS. STEPHENS

I wonder if he knew her?

HELEN

I'll ask him tonight...

MRS. STEPHENS

Is he taking you out?

HELEN

If he's free.

MRS. STEPHENS

That's very chivalrous of him.

Where's he taking you?

HELEN

I've no idea - and I don't suppose

he has...

MRS. STEPHENS

Which studio does he work at?

HELEN

I'll ask him.

MRS. STEPHENS

If he's free.

HELEN

I'll bring him in and introduce

you if...

MRS. STEPHENS

I feel I know him.

HELEN

Now how can you?

MRS. STEPHENS

He's here.

MRS. STEPHENS

Why don't we make him a present of

the window? He practically lives

there!

HELEN

How did you know where he was

standing?

MRS. STEPHENS

The back of my neck told me... the

part that I talk out of!

HELEN

Hallo...

MARK

Free?

HELEN

Yes.

MARK

Good! So am I...

HELEN

I'd like you to come in for a moment -

and meet my mother.

MARK

Yes, please...

HELEN (O.S.)

Darling, this is Mark... Mark, my

mother.

MARK (O.S.)

How do you do... Mrs. Stephens...

MRS. STEPHENS (O.S.)

Hallo, Mark.

MRS. STEPHENS

Have you been running, young man?

MARK

Yes...

(he hesitates)

... didn't want to be late for

Helen.

HELEN

Thank you, Mark - You deserve a

drink for that! What would you

like?

MARK

Nothing - thank you... very much...

HELEN

Darling, I've left your supper in

the...

MRS. STEPHENS

Tell me young man... Which studio

do you work at?

MARK (O.S.)

Chipperfield Studio . . .

MRS. STEPHENS

And that poor girl... where did

she work?

HELEN (O.S.)

At Brookwood.

MRS. STEPHENS

We were wondering if you knew her?

MARK

No - No, I didn't...

MRS. STEPHENS

A pity. I do like first-hand

information.

MRS. STEPHENS

Oh, well - I mustn't keep you

gossiping after you've run all the

way from - Where?

MARK

The station.

FADE OUT:

HELEN

Darling, may I tell you about your

supper?

MRS. STEPHENS

No... go and be told about yours!

(she takes Mark's

hand)

Goodbye, Mark... I expect we shall

meet again.

MARK

I hope so - Goodbye...

(He turns to the

door)

HELEN

Darling, we forgot to toss.

HELEN

Supper's laid out in the kitchen.

MRS. STEPHENS

If you're not back early, you'll

find me laid out with it!

HELEN

We'll be early! Good night, darling.

MRS. STEPHENS

Good night...

HELEN

Mark...

MARK

Yes, Helen?

HELEN

I want to ask you something rather

personal...

HELEN

How long is it since you've gone

out without that?

MARK

Without what?

HELEN

Your camera...

MARK

Oh...

MARK

I... don't think I know?

HELEN

Exactly. I've never seen you without

it... but are you going to need it

tonight?

HELEN

Well are you? And if so... shall I

bring some work with me too?

MARK

I'm not going to need it tonight!

HELEN

Good - then give it to me!

HELEN

...It'll be quite safe - I'll put

it away for you.

MARK

(in a whisper)

No!

HELEN

Then take it upstairs - if you

can't trust me with it...

MARK

I trust you.

HELEN

Then look...

HELEN

...let's put it in here.

HELEN

Come in - and see for yourself.

HELEN

We'll put it in here - and lock

it.

MARK

This... was my mother's room.

HELEN

Was it, Mark?...

HELEN

I am being tactless, aren't I?

... It's just that... I thought it

was growing into an extra limb,

and - but you bring it with you if

you want to.

HELEN

Thank you...

MARK

You...

HELEN

Thank you.

MARK

I feel...

HELEN

Yes?

MARK

Can't describe it! Could only

photograph it -

HELEN

Shall I tell you what I feel?

MARK

Yes.

HELEN

Famished!

MARK

Good!

DISSOLVE TO:

MARK

There's a small place round the

corner... It's awfully good on

Christmas Day.

HELEN

Is it?

MARK

Yes... there aren't too many open

then.

HELEN

No - it sounds fun.

MARK

This way.

HELEN

I adore new restaurants...

HELEN

Where is this restaurant?

MARK

Round the corner...

MRS. STEPHENS

Know much about films?

HELEN

Come on then...

MARK

Thank you.

DISSOLVE TO:

MRS. STEPHENS

Sorry, young man, Helen's out.

TONY

Oh!

MRS. STEPHENS

With Mark - from upstairs.

TONY

Oh!

MRS. STEPHENS

You can stay and talk to me - if

you like?

TONY

Well I...

MRS. STEPHENS

Know much about films?

TONY

Well...

MRS. STEPHENS

Or film studios?

TONY

No, I...

MRS. STEPHENS

Where's Chipperfield Studios?

TONY

Chipperfield, I suppose...

MRS. STEPHENS

There's a phone book outside...

Look up the number, will you? And

see if you can get it.

TONY

Certainly... and then I must go to

my room.

MRS. STEPHENS

Granted.

DISSOLVE TO:

HELEN

I like this place! And this dinner!

HELEN

...thank you, Mark...

MARK

Are you ready to talk about your

book?

HELEN

I'm ready to talk about you...

HELEN

It won't take a second - and it's

best to have it said.

HELEN

Carrying a camera is only one of

your habits, isn't it, Mark?

HELEN

... when you stared at that couple,

you were like the little boy on

that film you showed me... looking

over the wall at something he

shouldn't see. But Mark - you're

strong enough now to lift that

child off the wall... aren't you?

HELEN

... aren't you?

MARK

I'll try to be.

HELEN

Will you, Mark?... Will you really?

MARK

Yes...

HELEN

Lecture finished...

MARK

When your book's published - will

you go on working in a library?

HELEN

Yes, Mark... in case, one day, a

child comes in and asks for it!

MARK

I'll come in.

HELEN

I'm not popular with my customers!

They ask me for horror comics -

and I take their sticky hands and

drag them to where there are books!

HELEN

... and do you know, Mark, waiting

for them to come in next time and

ask for books... is as exciting...

as a horror comic...

MARK

What does your magic camera

photograph?

HELEN

People...

MARK

Yes?...

HELEN

It's owned by a little boy who is

terrified of grown-ups... but when

he looks in his magic camera he

sees grown-ups as they were when

they were children... and he isn't

frightened any longer.

HELEN

... and one day he gives his camera

away to a little boy who is even

more frightened of grown-ups than

he was - and do you know what he

finds?

HELEN

... that when he looks at grown-

ups without his camera he can still

see them as they were when they

were children!  And that means

that he's grown up himself...

MARK

What made you think of this story?

HELEN

You did!

HELEN

... I looked out of my window -

and saw you going off to work

carrying that camera like a little

boy with a satchel... and an idea

came... so thank you...

MARK

I'd like to think... I was

responsible... in some way...

HELEN

Now what do I do about the

photographs?

MARK

Take 'em!

MARK

Oh!

MARK

There isn't a single face that

doesn't look like a child's - not

a single one - if you catch it at

the right moment.

MARK

It would be a challenge!... Unlike

anything I've photographed!

HELEN

What have you photographed, Mark?

MARK

Everything. But nothing I'd want

children to see.

MARK

But this would belong to them -

and they'd know if it wasn't

right... Oh, Helen... I would like

to find those faces for you...

with you...

HELEN

Very well! Let's try!

MARK

You made a promise to your mother -

HELEN

(gently)

Yes, Mark...

MARK

You'd better keep it.

HELEN

Thank you...

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

HELEN

Mother must have gone to bed.

(she turns to find

him looking at her)

Mark, it was a wonderful evening...

MARK

That's what I was going to say...

a wonderful evening...

HELEN

(gently)

And you made it wonderful... without

your camera.

HELEN

(gently)

I'll get it for you.

HELEN

wonder how this sees grown-ups?

(she turns the camera

round)

...me, for instance... now that I

am one.

(she looks at herself in the lens)

MARK

Not you!

(he takes the camera

from her)

HELEN

Mark.

MARK

It never will... see you!

HELEN

Why not?

MARK

Whatever I photograph -

HELEN

Yes?

MARK

I always - lose...

HELEN

I don't understand.

HELEN

He'll wake Mother!

HELEN

... thank you, again, for my

evening.

(she is standing

very close to him,

smiling up into

his face)

Will you go to bed now - and not

stop up watching those films?

MARK

Well... I've a little work to do...

then I'll go to bed... and think

of how to find faces for you...

MARK

...faces which - are faces which...

HELEN

Good night, Mark...

MRS. STEPHENS

Good evening, Mark...

MARK

...how did you?

MRS. STEPHENS

The young man bathing himself

brought me to your door... I managed

the rest of the adventure alone...

MRS. STEPHENS

This is one room I expected to

find locked.

MARK

I was never allowed a key..., can't

get used to them.

MARK

I brought her home early.

MRS. STEPHENS

Thank you...

MARK

Is there something you...

MRS. STEPHENS

... a talk.

MARK

Next door would be more...

MRS. STEPHENS

I'm at home here... I visit this

room every night.

MARK

Visit?

MRS. STEPHENS

The blind always live in the rooms

they live under...

MRS. STEPHENS

Every night you pace for hours

above my head! Why?

MARK

I've no one to talk to... in the

rooms I live over...

MRS. STEPHENS

I'm told that you stare too much...

so do I.

MRS. STEPHENS

Cloth... with something hard inside

it...

MARK

It's a changing bag... we put films

in it - so that the light won't

spoil them...

MRS. STEPHENS

How odd - that the light can spoil

anything...

MRS. STEPHENS

Every night you switch on that

film machine.

MRS. STEPHENS

What are these films you can't

wait to look at?

MARK (O.S.)

Like a chair?

MRS. STEPHENS (O.S.)

What is the film you're showing

now?

MRS. STEPHENS

Why don't you lie to me? I'd never

know...

MARK

You'd know at once -

MRS. STEPHENS

Take me to your cinema.

MARK

Yes.

MRS. STEPHENS

What am I seeing, Mark?

MRS. STEPHENS

Why don't you answer?

MARK

(staring at the

screen)

It's no good - I was afraid it

wouldn't be.

MRS. STEPHENS

What?

MARK

The lights failed too soon.

MRS. STEPHENS

(pause)

They always do.

MARK

I'll have to try again.

MRS. STEPHENS

I've yet to meet an artist who

could judge his own work...

MRS. STEPHENS

What do you think you've spoiled?

MARK

An opportunity... now I must find

another.

MRS. STEPHENS

Why are you putting those lights

on my face?

MRS. STEPHENS (O.S.)

Mark...

MARK (O.S.)

It's almost over...

MARK

Please let me finish! It's for

Helen!

MRS. STEPHENS

What do you mean? It's for Helen?

MARK

She wants to see something I've

photographed!

He returns excitedly to his camera.

MRS. STEPHENS

My daughter sees enough of my face

without photographs...

MARK (O.S.)

Please... don't be frightened.

MRS. STEPHENS

Not frightened! Hot!

MRS. STEPHENS

So put that camera away...

MARK

Yes!

MRS. STEPHENS

In rather a hurry, aren't you?

MARK

It's late.

MARK

You must be tired...

MRS. STEPHENS

You're anxious to get rid of me

all of a sudden.

MRS. STEPHENS

I won't be selfish... You can take

some more pictures - if you want

to...

MARK

No... thank you.

MRS. STEPHENS

(quietly)

Why not, Mark?

MARK

Run out of film.

MRS. STEPHENS

Can't you find some - to please

Helen?

MRS. STEPHENS

You don't trust yourself to take

any more, do you?

MRS. STEPHENS

Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't

it Mark? A pity it can't be

photographed.

MRS. STEPHENS

if I'd listened to it years ago, I

might have kept my sight.

(she approaches the

door)

I wouldn't have let a man operate

I had no faith in... so I'm

listening to it now...

(she puts her face

close to him)

It says all this filming isn't

healthy - and that you need help...

MRS. STEPHENS

... get it, Mark... get it

quickly... and until you've got

it... I don't want you and Helen

to see each...

MARK

I'll never photograph her... I

promise you that.

MRS. STEPHENS

I'd rather you don't have the

chance.

MRS. STEPHENS

I mean it, Mark. And if you don't

listen to me... one of us will

move from this house - which would

be a pity, because we'd never find

a cheaper...

MARK

You'll never have to move... because

of me... I promise you.

MRS. STEPHENS

Good boy.

(she takes his hand)

The stairs are the difficult part...

MRS. STEPHENS

Far enough, Mark...

MARK

taking my picture?

MRS. STEPHENS

Yes ...

MARK

It's been a long time... since

anyone did...

MRS. STEPHENS

Mark... what's troubling you?

MARK

Good night, Mrs. Stephens.

MRS. STEPHENS

...you'll have to!

JARVIS

Have you any suspicions, Chief

Inspector?

INSPECTOR

It could be any of them...

SERGEANT

That's the trouble with film people -

they're all peculiar...

(hastily)

... present company excepted.

PUBLICITY MAN

Speaking of peculiar people.

PUBLICITY MAN

We've a psychiatrist coming down

today. Dr Rosen -

INSPECTOR

I know him.

PUBLICITY MAN

It's pure publicity - and I promise

he won't do any work.

INSPECTOR

What will he do?

PUBLICITY MAN

Get himself photographed... We're

telling the press he's here to

help the case - and to see if he

can spot the murderer.

SERGEANT

And the best of luck!

JARVIS

Do you object. Chief Inspector?

INSPECTOR

No...

INSPECTOR

I'll be frank. I'd welcome anyone's

help... I don't know how this maniac

kills - or why he kills - or who

he'll kill next, but if he isn't

caught quickly...

(he shrugs')

BADEN

Inspector, have you convinced

yourself he's a member of my unit?

INSPECTOR

No, sir ... but a few things seem

to point to it... No one outside

your unit admits to knowing the

girl... There was a trunk all ready

for her... and with the risks he

was running, I think he'd have to

use surroundings he was familiar

with... Where is your unit now?

BADEN

Waiting for me on the set.

INSPECTOR

I'd like to watch them at their

jobs, sir. It may tell me more

than a hundred interviews.

BADEN

But, Inspector, the strain on them

is already...

JARVIS

Come now, Arthur, if that's what

the Inspector wants.

INSPECTOR

I'm afraid it is, sir... now where

could I get the best view?

BADEN

(sulkily)

On the dolly... the camera... You

can watch everyone and everything

from there... including me!

INSPECTOR

Very well, sir ... I'll become a

member of your camera crew...

BADEN

(to Don Jarvis)

... if the unions don't object!

VOICE 1

I hear they're making an arrest

DRIVER

We're there, Doctor.

DOCTOR

(to Sergeant on

gate)

Dr Rosen!  What a pity.

DISSOLVE TO:

BADEN

Try it, darling... We'll all be

with you.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

(shouting)

Quiet, everyone. Let's run it!

DOCTOR

Terribly sorry.

ASSISTANT CAMERAMAN

That sneezer geezer's a

psychiatrist!... Heard it on the

grapevine.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

(shouting)

All right, everyone - let's run

it...

DIANE

I'd like to see... that one...

DIANE

... have you it... in red...?

ASSISTANT

Certainly, madam.

DIANE

... in... red

(suddenly she covers

her face in her

hands')

I can't! I can't, Arthur!

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

Ten minutes break, everyone!

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

Can you suggest anything, Doctor?

DOCTOR

No. It looked jolly interesting to

me.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

I mean to help her

psychologically...

DOCTOR

Yes. Give the girl a proper rest...

Ten minutes is useless!

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

(hastily)

Thank you, Doctor.

DOCTOR

What's your job?

MARK

I'm a focus-puller...

DOCTOR

Oh... so am I, in a way.

MARK

I was wondering if you knew my

father - Professor Lewis...

DOCTOR

Professor... but of course I knew

him. He lectured to me.

DOCTOR

He was an extraordinary man - quite

brilliant!

MARK

You know what he was interested in

before he died?

DOCTOR

No? Tell me...

MARK

I don't remember what he called

it... It was something to do with

what causes people to be... peeping

Toms...

DOCTOR

Scoptophilia!... That would interest

him! A most fertile mind.

MARK

Scopto...?

DOCTOR

philia... The morbid urge to gaze...

Coined since his day... Have you

any manuscripts of his which I

could...?

MARK

He thought... it could be cured...

DOCTOR

Usually. Now about his manuscripts -

MARK

Quickly?

DOCTOR

The cure? Very quick... A couple

of years analysis - three times a

week - an hour a time - and it's

soon up-rooted...

DOCTOR

... if you've any of his papers on

the subject?

MARK

Yes, Doctor...

DOCTOR

I'd like to see them - I'll give

you my address, young man.

SERGEANT

Wonder what all that's about?

INSPECTOR

We'll find out afterwards... Now,

listen... I want you to watch who

brings their own lunches... Someone

ate homemade cakes and sandwiches

by the side of those bushes - and

we may get a lead.

SERGEANT

Right, sir.

DISSOLVE TO:

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

We're stopping at four today - so

have a quick lunch, everyone! Back

at two sharp!

VOICE

Hey, Mark!

CLAPPER BOY

Can't wait to show you this!

(bringing out a

small postcard)

I ought to charge you!

CLAPPER BOY (O.S.)

You don't get that in Sight and

Sound - Isn't she terrific?  Got

some more - if you're interested?

MARK

You've given me... an idea...

CLAPPER BOY

I'll bet I have!

CLAPPER BOY

Hey! Where are you going?

MARK

Phone - may be my last chance -

and... thanks.

CLAPPER BOY

But your lunch?

MARK

You have it!

CLAPPER BOY

... some photograph! Well lit too!

CUT TO:

MARK

Can't manage Saturday, sir, but

they're letting us off early today!

This afternoon - after work - may

be my last chance!

CROSS CUT TO:

MR. PETERS

... be here at six o'clock. Milly'll

be waiting.

MARK

Six o'clock...

MR. PETERS

On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.

MARK

I'll be there, sir.

MR. PETERS

You'd better be!

MARK

Hallo? Is that the Public Library?

... You have a Miss Helen Stephens

employed there?  Yes... can you

tell me if her name is spelt with

a V or a PH, I want to send her a

tic-PH? ... Thank you.

CLAPPER BOY

They're waiting!

CUT TO:

DOCTOR ROSEN

He asked if I knew his father...

which I did... a brilliant man!

INSPECTOR

Is that all he wanted?

DOCTOR

think so... we had a little chat

about scoptophilia - and he's going

to show me...

INSPECTOR

About what?

DOCTOR

Voyeurism.

INSPECTOR

Eh?

DOCTOR

What makes people into Peeping

Toms, one of his father's subjects,

apparently.

INSPECTOR

(slowly)

Peeping Toms...

DOCTOR

An interesting boy... he has his

father's eyes... you don't suspect

him, do you?

INSPECTOR

I suspect 'em all - what about

you?

DOCTOR

I'm interested in that chap with

the bald head and hatchet face...

there's something on his mind!

INSPECTOR

No wonder... he's the director!

DISSOLVE TO:

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

All right, everyone. This is the

last shot... Make it a good one!

INSPECTOR

(quietly)

Got your list, Sergeant?

SERGEANT

(he produces if)

YES, SIR.

INSPECTOR

I want to see how some of them

spend their spare time...

SERGEANT

Which ones, sir?

INSPECTOR

Exactly, Sergeant...

(he looks round

thoughtfully)

... which ones?

DISSOLVE TO:

MR. PETERS

Don't make a habit of this!

MARK

I won't, sir.

MR. PETERS

Milly's upstairs.

MARK

Right, sir.

MR. PETERS

I've got to go out... If you finish

before I'm back, lock up and put

this through the letter-box...

(he holds out a key)

MR. PETERS

What's the matter? Haven't you

ever seen a key before?

MR. PETERS

The till will be empty - if that's

what you're smiling about.

MR. PETERS

You know what I want now! No fancy

stuff...

DISSOLVE TO:

MILLY

You've spoiled my whole evening,

you have!

MARK

Sorry, Milly.

MILLY

What's the idea?

MARK

I shan't be here tomorrow.

(he hurries to the

window)

MILLY

Why? Going on manoeuvres with the

boy scouts?

MARK

I thought so!

MILLY

Have you gone absolutely...

MARK

I'm just... completing a

documentary.

MILLY

You're a document and a half, you

are. Is it safe to be alone with

you?

MILLY

wasn't...

You haven't much time for me these

days.

HELEN

Tony...

TONY

It's all right - I'll be here - if

you want me.

(he turns to his

room)

... by the way... your mother was

yelling out something before you

came in... about Mark photographing

her.

HELEN

Photographing Mother? You must be

mistaken!

TONY

Of course. See you sometime.

HELEN

Mark...?

HELEN

Mark?  No answer. She looks

thoughtfully at the envelope in

her hand - then goes in to the

dark-room.

DETECTIVE

... don't know what to make of it,

sir ... He went to a library, a

solicitor's office, and a

newsagent's shop - private

photography there, if you ask me.

Shall I hang around outside the

house, sir? Don't think so,

either... All right, sir, I'll

give you the details when I get

back... Bye, sir.

receiver)

Don't let me see you...

frightened...

wide open...)

Leave!

then looks quickly

away)

Hurry, Helen!

HELEN

Not...

MARK

Leave!

HELEN

Not...

(she turns away

from him and forces

the words out)

... till I know...

MARK

Now!

HELEN

That film...

HELEN

That film...

HELEN

... is ... just a film...

HELEN

... isn't it?

HELEN

... horrible ... horrible... but...

just a film... isn't it?

MARK

No...

(he walks towards

the door)

I killed them...

(he locks the door

with a hint of

sadness)

And now that you know... I want

you with me... a while.

MARK

You'll be safe - as long as I can't

see you frightened - so stand in

the shadows, Helen... please...

MARK

... please...

HELEN

She's right... your mother... must

tell someone everything... sorry...

has to be you!

HELEN

This was his laboratory... and you

know some of what he did... but

not all.

MARK

... aged five...

MARK

... aged seven...

MARK

All the rooms were wired for

sound... and... still are.

MARK

Your room.

MARK

Your mother's .

MARK

Tony's.

TONY (O.S.)

No one will come in... honestly,

darling...

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

I don't care!

TONY

But darling...

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

Stop it, Tony!

HELEN

(quietly)

Turn it off!

HELEN

Look at me, Mark!

MARK

Not if you're frightened...

HELEN

Look at me!

HELEN

What did you do... to those girls?

MARK

No.

HELEN

What did you do, Mark...?

HELEN

If you want to torment me... for

the rest of my life... then make

me imagine!

HELEN

What did you do ... to those girls?

MARK

Can't...

HELEN

Show me, Mark...

MARK

But if you're frightened...

HELEN

Show me - or I'll remain

frightened... for the rest of my

life.  Show me!

MARK (O.S.)

Do you know... what the most

frightening thing in the world

is?...

MARK

It's fear.

MARK

So I did something... very simple...

MARK

Very simple.

MARK

When they felt the spike... touching

their throats... and knew I was

going to kill them...

MARK

... I made them - watch their own

deaths!

MARK

Made them see their own terror as

the spike went in... and if death

has a face, they saw that too!

MARK

Not you! Not you! I'll never

photograph you! I promised - I

promised - Not you!

HELEN

... frightened ... for you...

SERGEANT

Look out!

HELEN

Mark! Mark! Give yourself up!

MARK

I've been ready for this... for

such a long time...

HELEN

What are you...

MARK

It'll be all right.

MARK

I can beat that!

HELEN

Give yourself up... Mark!

MARK

Watch them, Helen... Watch them

say goodbye - one by one -

(he presses a master

switch on the wait)

I've timed this... so often...

HELEN

No - No!

MARK

I wish... I could have found your

faces for you...

MARK

Helen - I'm afraid!

MARK

I'm glad I'm afraid!
