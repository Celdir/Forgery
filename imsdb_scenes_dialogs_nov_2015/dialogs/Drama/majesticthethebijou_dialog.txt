THE BIJOU

Michael Sloane

REVISED DRAFT

October 14, 1997

"... the magic is all around you.

All the time.  Everywhere.

In every thing.

The trick... is to see it."

"GREETINGS FROM HOLLYWOOD!"

"I'M MEETING THE STARS AT HOLLYWOOD & VINE!"

CUT TO:

PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)

Of course, it's not like the

postcards say it is.  This is what

it's like.  I'm Pete Appleton, and

this is my town.

PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)

Born and raised here, thank you

very much.  Sometimes, it seems

like everyone here is from

somewhere else.  But everyone loves

the movies, so Hollywood is

everyone's town, and they come here

by the busload.  To them, Grauman's

Chinese Theater is just about the

most exciting place on the planet.

To me, it's the theater that's

playing "The African Queen."

DOORMAN

Newsreel's just starting, folks.

PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)

That's me and my girlfriend.  Her

name is Sandra Sinclair, and this

is her town, too -- she's from

Cleveland.  She came out here to be

an actress, and that's just what

she's doing.  The first picture I

ever wrote, a little potboiler

called "Sand Pirates of the

Sahara."  Okay, it ain't "Citizen

Kane," but you gotta start

somewhere.

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER

Bringing the news of the world to

you!

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER

Four years ago, in one of

filmland's darkest hours, ten men,

the so-called "Hollywood Ten," were

called to testify before the House

Committee of Un-American

Activities, investigating the

proliferation of the dreaded Red

Menace in Hollywood.

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER

Refusing to answer the lawmaker's

questions, cowering behind the

Fifth Amendment's protection

against self-incrimination, the ten

motion picture writers dared

Congress to come after them.  Well,

come after them they did!  And

after years of court wrangling,

it's now time to pay the piper!

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER

And so, it's off to jail, the

charge: Contempt of Congress!  This

should give you fellas something to

write about now!  A new round of

investigations begins this fall,

the mandate: Get the reds out of

Hollywood!

SANDRA

Pete, there's time before the

picture starts, you want to get

some popcorn?

PETE

You bet, honey.

PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)

We were young, we were in love, and

we were working in pictures.

Life... was good.

DISSOLVE TO:

PETE

(very chipper)

Mornin', Ray.  Whaddya know whaddya

say?  Me and Sandra caught "The

African Queen" at the Chinese last

night.  Great picture, great

picture.

RAY

Mr. Appleton.

PETE

What's with this "Mr. Appleton"

crap?  Your boss hiding in there?

RAY

You're clear to go in.

PETE

What's that mean?

RAY

Have a pleasant day.

PETE

Louise... what gives?

LOUISE

Oh Pete... they, uh, they gave

everybody the day off... while they

sort things out.

PETE

Sort what out?  Are my pages done?

LOUISE

They took 'em.

PETE

They took 'em?  Who took 'em?

Louise, what's going on...

LOUISE

Pete, I'm not even supposed to be

talking to you...

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Good morning, Peter.

PETE

Leo... what's going on?

CUT TO:

LEO

Peter, their hands are tied.  You

see that, don't you?

PETE

I... I don't believe this.

LEO

Are you saying it's a mistake, that

you didn't go to any meetings?

They say you did.

PETE

Who the hell is this "they?"

LEO

Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it

don't matter who the hell "they"

is.  "They" know who "they" are,

that's all that matters.

(deliberately)

Now, did you go to any meetings?

PETE

(on the spot)

No.  Yeah... I... I don't know.

Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before

Pearl Harbor.  I was in college.

It was a bunch of kids, and I was

just one of 'em.  I didn't believe

in what they were saying.  Hell, I

didn't even know what they were

saying!

LEO

So, you're saying that it's true.

You went to a meeting of a known

communist organization.

PETE

Leo, I was trying to impress a

skirt.  You know me, I'm non-

political.  Republican, Democrat,

Communist, there's not a dime's

worth of difference between 'em

anyway.

LEO

You should watch what you say.

PETE

I don't know who fingered me, but

I'm not a communist!

LEO

Kid, that cuts no ice with them.

PETE

(frustrated)

What?  That I'm accused of being a

communist when I don't happen to be

one?

LEO

They know you were at that meeting,

Peter.  They've been told, and they

know.

PETE

Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them"

to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do

anything wrong.  I fought in the

war, for crissakes!

LEO

Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the

PX at Fort Dix.

PETE

I was decorated.

LEO

I know.  A Purple Heart.

PETE

Exactly.

LEO

You broke your arm.  You were

coming out of a bar.  You were

drunk.

PETE

At least I was on our side!  Look,

they want me to testify?  I'll

testify.  I'll tell 'em anything

they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo,

this is my career!

LEO

You can't testify.

PETE

Why not?

LEO

Don't take this personally, kid.

If it were up to me, I'd have you

testify wearing your uniform and

your medal, wrapped in a flag with

one hand on your heart and the

other hand on a bible.  What can I

say?  I like you.

LEO

They don't want you to testify

because you're not a big enough

fish for them.  They just don't

want you writing pictures for now.

That's all.

PETE

(under his breath)

Yeah, well, that's enough.

LEO

Peter, I believe in you.  More to

the point, I read your new

script... um...

PETE

"Ashes To Ashes?"

LEO

That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes."

I think it's great.  But it'll

never get made with this communist

business hanging over your head.

You can't work until you're cleared

-- and believe me, starting right

now, I'm gonna do everything I can

to make that happen.

PETE

So, it is a blacklist.

LEO

(defensive)

Don't say that.  There is no such

thing as a blacklist.

(calm)

Now, are you gonna play ball?

PETE

(sullenly)

Yes.

(then, pissed)

Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!

LEO

(hand on Pete's shoulder)

Kid, this is the United States

Government we're talkin' about.

Fair ain't the point.

"ASHES TO ASHES"

By Peter Appleton

PETE

(musing)

Huh.  Red...

SANDRA (O.S.)

Pete?  Pete...?

SANDRA

Oh, Pete...

SANDRA

What happened?

PETE

What exactly did you hear?

SANDRA

That you got let go.

PETE

I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie

Ruskin directing the picture you're

in?

SANDRA

He was, but he got sick.  We got a

new director today.  Why?

PETE

Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's

catching.

SANDRA

You mean, he was... let go, too?

PETE

(sotto, an appeal)

They're saying I'm a communist,

Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that.

I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna

win, but I'll need your help.

PETE

A lot of good people are being

accused of things they didn't do.

Hell, even if I was a communist,

this is America, goddammit, a

person should be able to be

whatever they want to be!  Right?

SANDRA

(nervously)

Of course, but I... I don't know

how I... how much help I can be to

you.  This is the sort of thing...

someone saying you're a

communist... it can ruin your

career.

PETE

Will you help me, Sandy?

SANDRA

I'll have to think about this.  I

have to get back... I should go...

PETE

So nice to be a pariah.

CUT TO:

JERRY

Pete.  You think maybe you've had

enough?

PETE

Bought the bottle, didn't I?

(raises the shot)

To the United States of America.

Long my she wave.

PETE

(trying to light a smoke)

Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.

JERRY

What.

PETE

You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?

JERRY

(helps Pete light his

cigarette)

The G-man?

PETE

(thickly)

Zackly.

JERRY

Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in

here wearing a dress, I wouldn't

know him.

PETE

Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.

JERRY

(glancing around)

You should watch what you say.  You

don't know who's listening.

PETE

You know I'm not a communist, don't

you, Jer?

JERRY

Sure, I suppose.  That why you're

on a bender?

PETE

This is not a bender yet.  This is

the start of a bender.  But I can

see how you were confused, they

look a lot alike.

JERRY

Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll

call that girlfriend of yours,

what's her name... Sandy?

PETE

(laughs)

Sandra Sinclair.

JERRY

Gimmee her number, I'll have her

pick you up.

PETE

Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her

real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No

one's who they really are, Jer.

Everyone's someone else.  Even you.

Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter

Appleton, the communist who's not

really a communist.

JERRY

I wanna close up soon.  C'mon,

let's call her.

PETE

Nope.  Can't.  We're through.

JERRY

Then I'll call you a cab.

PETE

I'll save you the trouble.

(beat)

I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.

PETE

'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll

be seein' ya, Jer.

JERRY

Pete...

PETE

(mumbling)

Drive.  Drive.  Bad idea.  Too

drunk to drive.

PETE

One-thirty.  Huh!  Early.  Can't go

home yet.

PETE

Oops.

DISSOLVE TO:

PETE

Huh?  Whatsa...

PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)

I had no idea how I got to Santa

Monica, but it certainly was a good

idea.  I don't think I could've

faced the headache I had alone in

my apartment.  At least I had the

ocean air.

PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)

Three forty-five.  I had only been

there for a couple of hours at

most.  Truth be told, I was still

fairly drunk.

PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)

I'd head north until the sun came

up or I ran out of gas, whichever

came first.

DISSOLVE TO:

PETE

Shit.

PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)

Guess which came first.

CUT TO:

PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)

I should've known better than to

think that a service station in the

sticks would be open at this hour,

but it wasn't like I had a lot of

choices.

PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)

What the hell.  At least there'd be

a diner opening in a couple of

hours.  I'd get some pie and

coffee, and then I could worry

about the gas.

SLOW!

NARROW BRIDGE - SINGLE LANE - NO GUARDRAIL

USE CAUTION!

PETE

(gasping)

Oh my god!  I don't believe... oh

my god...

CUT TO BLACK.

OLD MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Maggie, whatcha got there?  Huh,

girl?  Whatcha find?

OLD MAN

Mister, who are ya?  my dog likes

you, but that don't mean much, she

likes skunks, too.  Sweet n'stupid,

that's why I keep her.

OLD MAN

Mister, you okay?  You look wet.

You in an accident or somethin'?

PETE

I... I don't know.

OLD MAN

You best come with me.  Can ya

walk?

PETE

I... yes, I think so.

OLD MAN

Come on, we'll have the Doc look

you over.

PETE

My head hurts.

OLD MAN

I shouldn't be surprises.  You

smell like that was quite a night

before you had there.

(to the dog)

Maggie!  Let's go now!

WELCOME TO

LAWSON, CALIFORNIA

EST. 1869

ELEV. 275    POP. 1755

THE TOWN

THAT GAVE ITS ALL

OLD MAN (STANTON)

Name's Stanton Lawson.  My

ancestors founded this town.

PETE

Ancestors?

STANTON

Actually, my grandpap.  But

"ancestors" sounds better, don't

it?

(hands Pete a

handkerchief)

Here.

PETE

I suppose.  Thanks.

STANTON

You look familiar, fella.  What's

your name?

PETE

I'm... I... I honestly don't know.

CUT TO:

PETE

They all know you?

STANTON

'Course they all know me.  And I

know all them.  Town's got my name,

don't it?

STANTON

Ernie Cole here just got himself

elected mayor.  Lost both his boys

in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and

Willie at Normandy.

PETE

(thinking)

The war...

STANTON

(points across the street)

Mabel over there at the diner lost

her husband Max.  Okinawa, I

believe.

STANTON

All told, this little town gave

sixty-two of its finest to the war.

Seventeen of 'em at Normandy alone.

More'n its share, I should say.

Got us a letter from President

Truman.  City council commissioned

a war memorial.  Been sittin' in

the basement of city hall these six

years.  Town never had the heart to

put it up.  Place just hasn't been

the same since the war.

STANTON

You hungry, son?

PETE

Yes.  Very.

STANTON

Got any money?

STANTON

Six bits.  More'n enough to buy

some breakfast.  C'mon.

CUT TO:

PETE

(mouth full)

Pie's... good.

MABEL

(wryly)

Like you could tell.

(to Stanton)

Where'd you find him?

STANTON

Down by the wash.

MABEL

We gotta put a rail on that thing

before someone else gets killed.

(to Pete)

Three people have died there,

Mister.  You're lucky to be alive.

PETE

(draining the coffee cup)

Thanks.  More coffee?

MABEL

You know, you look familiar.  You

ever been in here before?

STANTON

He don't remember who he is, Mabel.

Gonna take him to the Doc, as soon

as he gets in.

MABEL

(distractedly)

Doc should be in for his coffee and

bear claw any minute...

(to Pete)

You sure you never been in here?

PETE

I'd remember this pie.

MABEL

(patting his hand)

I'll just get you another piece.

LARDNER

'Mornin' Harry.  Fine day, isn't

it?

HARRY

Morning, Doc.  Yes, yes it looks

just fine.

LARDNER

Plenty to do today?

HARRY

(vaguely)

Oh, yes, plenty.  Plenty.

LARDNER

After you.

LARDNER

Mornin' Mabel, Stan.

MABEL

Mornin' Doc.  Got some new business

for you today.

LARDNER

Hello, son.  How'd that happen?

STANTON

He don't know.  And he don't know

his name, neither.  Found him down

by the wash.

LARDNER

You'd better come with me, son.

(to Mabel, indicating the

coffee and danish)

On my tab?

MABEL

You bet.

PETE

Thanks.  Great pie.

MABEL

(blushing)

You're welcome.  Come again.

HARRY

(wide eyed)

Sweet Jesus...

CUT TO:

LARDNER'S VOICE

Follow my finger.  Just use your

eyes.  That's it.  Good.

STANTON

He was passed out cold.  Maggie

woke 'im.

LARDNER

Uh-huh.  He looks familiar.

(to Pete)

Open your mouth.  Say "ah."

STANTON

Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't

place him, though.  To look at him,

you'd think the cheese slid off his

cracker.

(looks at his watch)

Well, morning's half-over.  I'm

off.

PETE

Thank you, Mr. Lawson.

STANTON

Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.

LARDNER

Any idea how you got here, son?

PETE

No, sir.

LARDNER

Been drinkin' a bit, have we?

PETE

I don't remember.  I guess so.

Smells like it.

(smacks his lips and

frowns)

Tastes like it.

LARDNER

Well, you've been wet to the skin.

You must've fallen in.

PETE

I guess I did.

LARDNER

Lucky you got out, that water's got

quite a pull, and it empties

straight into the ocean.

LARDNER

Here, one of mine.

PETE

Thanks.

LARDNER

Do you remember if you were driving

a car?  Maybe you went over the

bridge.  No guard rail there, it's

easy to do.  It's happened before.

PETE

It's possible.  I just don't

remember.

LARDNER

And you don't know your name or who

you are, that right?

PETE

(frustrated)

I... no, I... I just can't...

LARDNER

(gently)

It's okay, son.  We just need to

call you something.  That's all.

LARDNER

What is it?

PETE

Call me... Ishmael?

LARDNER

Well, at least you remember "Moby

Dick."

CUT TO:

LARDNER

(into phone)

Stanton found him by the wash.  Not

hurt too bad, but he took a nasty

bump on the head and he can't

remember who he is.  We both think

he looks familiar, but we can't

place him.  You bet.  He'll be

here.

LARDNER

That's me and my daughter Adele.

My pride and joy.  Charms the fish

right out of the lake, she does.

PETE

She's very pretty.

LARDNER

Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way

over, and maybe we can get to the

bottom of who you are...

LARDNER

... sorry 'bout that, but you do

look familiar to me.

PETE

Wish I could say the same thing.

CUT TO:

HARRY

(excited)

Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man

in there...

ELDRIDGE

(startled)

Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna

give me a heart attack right in

front of the doctor's office?

HARRY

Listen to me!  The young man in

there...

ELDRIDGE

(interrupting)

Stan Lawson found him unconscious

by the wash this morning, and I'm

here to investigate, and if we find

anything interesting, it'll be in

the paper, so why don't you just...

HARRY

Cecil, listen to me!

HARRY

(breathless)

It's Luke.

CUT TO:

ELDRIDGE

No wallet, huh?

LARDNER

No identification at all.

(beat)

What're you thinkin', Cecil?

ELDRIDGE

What I'm thinkin' is we got us one

a'two things here.  A mystery or a

damn miracle.  And by god I can't

tell which.

(to Pete)

Boy, you say you have no idea who

you are?  That right?

PETE

Yes.

ELDRIDGE

You ever been in this town before,

to your knowledge?

PETE

No.  But...

ELDRIDGE

But what?

PETE

Well, this place sorta reminds me

of something.

ELDRIDGE

What's that?

PETE

"It's a Wonderful Life."

ELDRIDGE

The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I

remember that one.  Saw it over at

the Bijou.  So, you remember that,

huh?

PETE

"It's a Wonderful Life?"

ELDRIDGE

Or the Bijou.  Either one.

PETE

I remember the picture... but I

don't remember where I saw it.

ELDRIDGE

Doc, with your permission, I want

to bring someone in here.  Maybe

it'll jar this young man's memory.

LARDNER

By all means.

ELDRIDGE

(to someone offscreen)

Harry, why don't you come on in

here.

LARDNER

(softly, to Eldridge)

Are you saying that he's...

ELDRIDGE

(smiling broadly)

Shhhhhh.

HARRY

I knew all along.  I knew you were

alive!  Oh, Luke...

LARDNER

(mouth agape in disbelief)

Mother o'god...

ELDRIDGE

(to Pete)

Give the man a hug, boy!  That's

your father!

PETE

My father...?

CUT TO:

ELDRIDGE

C'mon, I'll give you two a lift

back to the Bijou.

PETE

The Bijou?

LARDNER

That's where you live.

PETE

We live in a theater?

HARRY

Only one in town.

(he opens the car door for

Pete)

Get in, son.

ELDRIDGE

(sotto, to Lardner)

Ben, when's Delly due back?

LARDNER

(sotto)

Tomorrow afternoon...

(seized by a thought)

... oh my god...

ELDRIDGE

(sotto)

Exactly.  Break it to her gently.

LARDNER

Get plenty of rest, Luke.  You took

a pretty big wallop there.

LARDNER

Good to have you back.

CUT TO:

LUKE

Excuse me... what's your, um, your

name?

HARRY

Harry, son.  Harry.

LUKE

And... what's my name again?

HARRY

Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've

been "Luke" since you were a baby.

LUKE

Ah.

(taking it for a spin)

Luke.  Luke.  I like it.

LUKE

How long have I been gone?

LUKE

How long?

HARRY

(gently)

You never came back from the war.

We were told you were missing and

presumed dead.

LUKE

When did I leave?

HARRY

You joined up one month to the day

after Pearl Harbor.  January

seventh... nineteen forty-two.

HARRY

Nine and-a-half years ago.

LUKE

Nine and-a-half years...

ELDRIDGE

Comin' up on the Bijou, gents.

ELDRIDGE

Here we are.

HARRY

Well, son, you're home!

" HE B J U"

HARRY

Thanks for the lift, Cecil.

ELDRIDGE

Don't mention it.  Welcome home,

Luke.

LUKE

(faint smile)

Thanks.

HARRY

Wait'll you see the inside!

LUKE

(deadpan)

Can't wait.

CUT TO:

HARRY

We've been closed for a while.

LUKE

(smiling wanly)

Ah.

LUKE

(turning to Harry)

Exactly how long has the Bijou been

closed?

HARRY

Hmmmm... after you left, it was

difficult, and then Lily -- that's

your mother -- she took ill and

died... we haven't shown a picture

since forty-eight.

LUKE

Why?

HARRY

(deep breath)

Well, after the war, with so many

of the town's boys killed, people

around here didn't much feel like

going to the movies, I guess.  Some

of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles,

Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't

much to keep 'em here, I expect.

And now with this "television"

thing -- people just aren't going

out as much as they used to.

LUKE

Didn't you have any help?

HARRY

Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but

they really couldn't help much.

Broke their hearts when we closed

up.  Broke mine, too.

(brightening)

But now that you're back, well,

things will be different around

here, that's for sure.

(rises, grabs Luke's arm)

C'mon, I'll show you where we live.

CUT TO:

HARRY

The day you shipped out.  That was

a proud day for your mother and me.

Last time you saw her.  Last time I

saw you.

HARRY

Till today.

HARRY

That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her

soul.

LUKE

(repeating)

Mother.

(to Harry)

She's beautiful.

HARRY

(coming over)

Well, yes, that she was.  She

certainly made this place a home.

HARRY

(brightly)

Can I get you anything?  I can put

some coffee on or some...

CUT TO:

HARRY

(softly)

When I woke up this morning, my son

was dead.  Now, I have my boy

again.

(closes his eyes)

I have my boy again.

FADE TO BLACK.

HARRY

(smiling)

'Morning, Son.

ELDERLY WOMAN

(smiling)

Good morning, Luke.

ELDERLY BLACK MAN

(no expression)

'Mornin'.

HARRY

Sleep well?

HARRY

They couldn't wait to see you.

LUKE

Who... are they?

HARRY

This is the staff of the Bijou.

LUKE

Oh.  What... what time is it?

HARRY

Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an

early start.

HARRY

Oh, I'm sorry, they know you, but

you don't... you need to be re-

introduced.  Luke, this is Mrs.

Irene Terwilliger.

MRS. TERWILLIGER

Head cashier and refreshments

clerk.  So glad to have you back,

my boy!

(to Harry)

Much more handsome than I remember

him.

HARRY

And this fine fellow is our head

usher, resident fix-it man and

custodian.  Luke, meet Old Tim.

(to Old Tim)

You remember Luke, don't you?

LUKE

Is there a young Tim?

OLD TIM

No.

LUKE

Well, then, why do they call you

"Old Tim?"

OLD TIM

I'm old.

HARRY

Well, lots to do, so we'd better

get a move on...

CUT TO:

HARRY

'Fraid this has seen better days.

Well, I was meaning to get a new

screen, anyway.

OLD TIM

I n-need me a new uniform.

HARRY

(to Luke)

I promised him a new uniform when

we re-opened.

(to Old Tim)

And you'll get one, too.

LUKE

You know, I hate to bring this up,

but screens and uniforms and paint

and repairs are going to take

money, which I'm willing to bet

none of us has.

LUKE

I thought so.

HARRY

Anyone want to see the projector?

CUT TO:

HARRY

Beautiful.  Bright and even from

edge to edge.  See for yourself.

HARRY

She's always been a bit tricky.

CUT TO:

OLD TIM

Bless.

MRS. TERWILLIGER

Thank you, Timothy.

MRS. TERWILLIGER

(sotto)

What do you suppose they're talking

about?

OLD TIM

Dunno.  Boy's smart.

MRS. TERWILLIGER

(brightly)

Yes, he seems to be.

OLD TIM

Bad for us.

LUKE

Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the

books here?

HARRY

No, your mother did, then I did

after she passed.

LUKE

Well, I'm the first one to admit

that I don't know anything about

bookkeeping, but there are some

very interesting things in here.

LUKE

(reading)

"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball

of Fire.'"

HARRY

(appreciatively)

Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck.

Yowsa.

LUKE

(reading)

"Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six

admissions, receipts including

concessions, $84.75... plus one

fryer and two-dozen eggs."

HARRY

Yes?

LUKE

"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"

HARRY

Forty-two was a lean year around

here.  The war had just started...

you were gone less than a month...

and we were coming off a bit of a

drought as I recall.  Not everyone

could ante up the price of a

ticket, and a chicken's as good as

money if you ask me.  At that time,

it meant a lot to the folks around

here to be able to come to the

pictures.

LUKE

Yeah, I know, but poultry...?

HARRY

(rhapsodically)

I know it's hard to believe, son,

but this place, this little place

this wasn't a theater then, this

was a palace!  Any man, woman,

child, you, me, it didn't matter,

you bought your ticket and you

walked in and you...

HARRY

... you were in a palace.  It was

like a dream.  It was like heaven,

like you died and went to a palace

in heaven, that's what it was like.

And spotless, too.

HARRY

Come with me!

HARRY

(smiling)

Maybe you had problems and worries

out there, but once you came

through that door, they didn't

matter anymore.  In here, you were

safe.  Maybe it was just an escape

from reality, but... oh, god... it

was beautiful.

HARRY

(exuberant)

Charlie Chaplin.  Keaton and Lloyd.

Swanson.  And later on, Clark Gable

and Claudette Colbert and Jimmy

Stewart and James Cagney and Bogart

and Becall and Judy and Mickey...

and Fred and Ginger.

HARRY

(emphatically)

They... were... like... gods!

HARRY

And that... was the altar.  Would

you remember if I told you, we felt

lucky to be here, to have the

privilege of watching them?

(sadly)

This television thing.  Why would

you want to sit at home and watch a

little box with a little screen?

Because it's convenient?  Because

you don't have to get dressed and

put on a coat and a tie and a hat?

Because you can just... sit there?

How can you call that

"entertainment," all alone in your

living room?  Where are the other

people?  Where's the audience?

HARRY

(emphatically)

Where's the magic?

HARRY

I'll tell you.  In a place like

this, the magic is all around you.

All the time.  Everywhere.  In

every thing.

HARRY

The trick... is to see it.

LUKE

But I...

HARRY

Son, I think you loved the Bijou

even more than I did.  You've got

to remember that.  You've got to.

DISSOLVE TO:

ADELE

Dad?

LARDNER

Delly?  In here.

LARDNER

How'd it go?

ADELE

Not as bad as I thought it would.

I think I passed.

LARDNER

(kisses her forehead)

That's my girl!

(he hugs her again)

Did you...?

ADELE

No hiccups, which was good.  Who

wants an attorney who gets the

hiccups when she gets nervous?

("serious" lawyer voice)

"Your (hic!) honor, I (hic!)

object!"

LARDNER

I always told you, baby...

(taps her head)

... it's all up here.

ADELE

Dad?  What is it?

LARDNER

Well, it's...

ADELE

(extreme concern)

Oh my god... who died?

CUT TO:

LARDNER

Drink slowly.

LARDNER

From the other side of the glass.

ADELE

I think (hic!) it's worse (hic!)

now.

LARDNER

That always used to work.

ADELE

Yeah, well it's not everyday you

get (hic!) news like this.  You're

sure he's (hic!) okay?  Other than

the (hic!) bump on the head?

LARDNER

(hedging)

Well...

ADELE

(hic!) Dad... (hic!)

LARDNER

He doesn't remember anything,

Delly.  Doesn't know how he got

here, doesn't remember his father,

the town, the Bijou, anyone...

ADELE

... including me.  Right?  (hic!)

LARDNER

I'm afraid not.  He looked right at

your picture without batting an

eye.  But it's probably temporary.

He got all the way to Lawson, so he

clearly knew who he was and what he

was doing until he hit his head.

I'm sure it'll all come back to

him.  It just takes a catalyst.

ADELE

You mean, (hic!) me?

LARDNER

It's possible.

CUT TO:

HARRY

I take breakfast and supper at

Mabel's every day except Sunday.

Have for years, since Lily died.

If it weren't for Mabel, I'd

probably starve to death.

ERNIE

Harry!  Hold on a second!

HARRY

It's really him, Ernie.

ERNIE

(agape)

Well, I'll be...

ERNIE

By god, Luke, if it isn't good to

see you again.

LUKE

(uncertain)

Uh, thanks.  Good to see you again,

too, uh...

HARRY

Ernie.

LUKE

... Ernie.

ERNIE

(still at a lose)

Well, I'll be...

HARRY

We were just gonna get some supper.

Would you like to join us?

ERNIE

Would I ever!

WOMAN'S VOICE

Is that Luke Trumbo?

KATIE

Oh, Luke, it's so good to have you

back!

HARRY

Katie, would you like to join us

for dinner?  The more, the merrier.

CUT TO:

CARL

(eagerly)

Hey, Luke, remember the time you

and me, we was playing with

firecrackers and the one you was

lighting blew up too soon and

singed all the hair offa my head?

LUKE

Uh, no.  What happened?

CARL

(deflated)

Well... um, all the hair got singed

offa my head.  It was pretty funny.

LUKE

Oh.

CARL

Even my eyebrows.  But they grew

back.

HARRY

Carl.  Friend of yours from high

school.  Everybody calls him

"Cueball."

LUKE

(sincerely)

Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.

CARL

(brightening)

Oh, heck, that's all right.  It's

just good to have you back.  Isn't

that right, Bob?  Hey, Luke, you

remember my brother Bob?  You two

joined up the same day.

LUKE

(quietly)

Hey, Bob.  Good to meet you.

ERNIE

Luke, I know there's a question

that's on everybody's mind.

LUKE

What's that?

ERNIE

Well, now that you're back, what're

your plans?

HARRY

Gonna re-open the Bijou, that's

what.

STANTON

That true?

LUKE

(on the spot)

Well... we're gonna try.

ERNIE

That's a lot of work, son.  Place's

been closed, what, three, four

years now.  Gonna be tough.

HARRY

If it's tough, that means it's

worth doing.

ERNIE

Hey, where's Spencer Wyatt?

SPENCER'S VOICE

Uh, back here, Mr. Mayor.

ERNIE

Well, come on out here so's we can

see you.

SPENCER

Hey, Luke.

LUKE

Hi, Spencer.

ERNIE

Spence, that band of yours -- you

think they're ready to play?

(to Luke)

Spencer and his pals went ahead and

got together a good ol' big band.

SPENCER

We've been practicing... uh, sure,

I guess.

ERNIE

Well, how about tomorrow night,

eight p.m., in city hall square?

What I'm proposin' is a "Welcome

Home Luke" celebration.

ADELE

Do you... remember me?

LUKE

I've seen you before.  Your

picture...

MABEL

(sotto)

Look!

LUKE

... but I don't think I remember

you.

LUKE

But I'll sure try.

CUT TO:

LUKE

What.

ADELE

No, I... I just wondering where

you've been all this time.

LUKE

Me too.

ADELE

You look... different.

LUKE

I do?

ADELE

Yeah, a little.  I think you grew

an inch or so.  And you've lost

weight.

LUKE

I did?  Huh!

ADELE

(to the group)

You can all go home, now.  He's not

going anywhere.

LUKE

Go on home, folks.  And thanks for

the welcome.

LUKE

I'll be home in a little while,

Harry.  Don't wait up.

HARRY

You two have a lot of catching up

to do, I guess.

LUKE

You bet.

HARRY

Goodnight, son.

(tips his hat)

'Night, Delly.

LUKE

There.  We're alone.

ADELE

Then why do I feel like we're still

being shadowed?

LUKE

Well... where can we go?

ADELE

I know a place.  Come on!

LUKE

City hall?

ADELE

You must not remember anything.

Come on.

ADELE

You first.

LUKE

Why me?

ADELE

Be a gentleman.  You have to help

me down.

CUT TO:

ADELE (O.S.)

When we were kids, my Dad was

mayor, and you and me and a bunch

of others used to come down here

all the time.

ADELE

Of course, there was a lot more

room before they stuck the memorial

down here.

LUKE

(looks at the door)

How'd they get it inside?

ADELE

Through the door.  It comes apart.

ADELE

Your name's on here.  See?

ADELE

Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo."

And all the others.  I knew them

all.  So did you.  We went to

school with most of them.

LUKE

It doesn't seem right, this being

down here.  It ought to be where

people can see it.

ADELE

After they commissioned it, no one

could ever agree on where to put

it.  The Methodists wanted it in

front of the Methodist Church, the

Presbyterians wanted it in front of

the Presbyterian Church, the city

council wanted it in the lobby of

City Hall.  Everyone finally got

tired of the fighting.  So they

stuck it down here.

LUKE

So, you're really gonna be a

lawyer?

ADELE

(suddenly defensive)

And why not?

LUKE

Whoa.

ADELE

(smiling)

Sorry.  You don't know how many

times I've heard that.  "A lady

lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a

woman couldn't be as good a lawyer

as a man.  Or better, in fact.

LUKE

Have you always wanted to be a

lawyer?

ADELE

You... don't remember, but yes,

ever since I was a little girl.

LUKE

What did... what did I want to be?

ADELE

(gently)

Oh, well... I guess you... in high

school, you were a pretty good

first baseman.  And we were on the

debate team together.  But... I

think you were gonna run the Bijou.

You were brought up there, and you

loved it so much.  And I think you

knew how much the town needed a

place like that.

LUKE

I just wish I could remember some

of this.

LUKE

You don't have a boyfriend or

anyone... you know... like that?

ADELE

Actually, I was married.  For four

years.  But... well, we didn't fit

together.  I'm divorced now.

LUKE

I'm sorry.

ADELE

No, it's okay.  See, when two

people belong together, the other

person should be the... the key

that unlocks the rest of you... I'm

not making sense, am I?

LUKE

(moving toward her)

No, you are.  I know exactly what

you mean.  It's not that you're

missing something.  It's that the

other person gives something to

you... that you had all the time.

You just didn't see it until they

came along.

ADELE

(smiling)

Yeah...

LUKE

We were in love... weren't we?

ADELE

(quietly)

Yes.

(then:)

Hic!

LUKE

What was that?

ADELE

Nothing.  (hic!)

LUKE

Do you have the...

ADELE

I'm (hic!) fine.  Really.  (hic!)

LUKE

Were we going to get married?

ADELE

Eventually.  We were going to be

(hic!) engaged... when you came

back from (hic!) overseas...

ADELE

(breathless)

... but you had to go... serve

(hic!) your country...

ADELE

Hey... it worked.

DISSOLVE TO:

LUKE

Hey, fella.  So you live here, too,

huh?  How come Harry didn't mention

that?

LUKE

Um, Old Tim?  Sorry, it's late.

It's Luke.  Can I come in?

OLD TIM

Found me.

LUKE

Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I

didn't know anyone lived here...

well, besides Harry.  And me.

OLD TIM

Not used to visitors.

(gesturing)

Sit.

LUKE

So I guess this fellow belongs to

you.  What's his name?

OLD TIM

Cat.

LUKE

Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.

(pets Cat)

Hi, Cat.

OLD TIM

(sudden change-of-subject)

We thought you was dead, you know.

(another new thought)

It's okay that I live here?

LUKE

Of course.

OLD TIM

Do you think I'll get me a new u-u

uniform?

LUKE

I'll do everything I can.

OLD TIM

T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I

always... I always wanted to wear

my uniform from the Great War, but

your daddy, he always said no,

that's not an usher's u-u-uniform,

that's an army uniform and the

Bijou, she's not the army.  They

give me a medal, but I lost it in

the h-h-hospital.  I forget things

sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.

LUKE

Yeah... me too.

CUT TO:

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?  You

in there?  This is the Super, I

have the master key and I'm coming

in!

LEO

You smell gas?

SUPER

Don't smell nothin'.  He must not

be dead in here.

LEO

Jesus.

SUPER

Hey, it's the best way to tell.

SUPER

You think he's drunk somewhere?

LEO

(under his breath)

Wouldn't blame him if he was.

SUPER

Well, his rent's past due and he

said to call you in case of an

emergency.  He lose his job or

somethin'?

LEO

(holding out his folding

money)

What's his rent?

SUPER

Thirty a month.

LEO

Here's three months rent, and a ten

spot for no more questions and to

keep an eye on his place.  Now, I

need a moment alone.

SUPER

(examining the bill)

Huh?

LEO

Take a hike.  Am-scray.

SUPER

Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door

shut when you leave.

LEO

(into phone)

Police department.  I want to

report a missing person.

CUT TO:

CLYDE

(into phone)

You say you know nothing about it.

You say this, yet you offer no

proof.  How am I supposed to

believe you?

SECRETARY

Mr. Clyde?  Agents Saunders and

Brett need to see you.

CLYDE

(covering the phone)

You do see that I'm busy, do you

not?

SECRETARY

It's about Appleton.

CLYDE

Tell them to come in.

(into phone)

I'll have to call you back.  I love

you too, Mother.

SAUNDERS

We've got a situation developing...

CLYDE

(interrupting)

Will you take those goddamn hats

off?

SAUNDERS

We've got a situation developing

out on the coast.  Appleton's just

been reported missing.

CLYDE

This is good.  This is very good.

BRETT

Los Angeles Police Department

investigated.  His car's missing.

No signs of forced entry or

struggle at his apartment.

CLYDE

You two are on this as of now.

Tell the LAPD their investigation

has been federalized on my order.

You find me this Appleton.

(leans back, smiling)

I want to see what this one has to

say.

CUT TO:

MRS. TERWILLIGER

(sings)

"The object of my affection, Can

change my complexion, From white to

rosy red..."

LUKE

Well...

HARRY

Yes?

LUKE

Between a new screen, paint,

plumbing for the concession stand,

and about a hundred other repairs

around the theater... it's going to

cost at least nine hundred dollars

to get the Bijou into shape to open

up.

MRS. TERWILLIGER

Oh, my.

HARRY

(taken aback)

Nine hundred...

LUKE

And you have sixty-eight dollars

and thirty-seven cents in the bank.

Your only source of income are my

veteran's death benefit of forty

dollars a month, to which you're no

longer entitled since I'm alive,

and these ten dollar a month cash

deposits you make.  What are those?

HARRY

(glances at Old Tim)

They're...

OLD TIM

That's my r-r-rent.

LUKE

Oh.

HARRY

It's all my fault.  I was

neglectful and this is the price of

that.

MRS. TERWILLIGER

Don't say that.

HARRY

Well, it's true.  Wanting to open

this place back up.  It's folly,

Irene, pure and simple.  Might as

well just call it what it is.

CUT TO:

ADELE (O.S.)

Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him

in?  I'll be right down.

LARDNER

Honey, I... I can't... it's the...

LARDNER

(giving in)

Oh, hell...

LARDNER

Evening, Luke.

LUKE

Evening, Doctor Lardner.

LUKE

What's wrong?

LARDNER

(shaken from his reverie)

Uh, no... just seeing you standing

there, it reminded me... there's a

word for it...

LUKE

Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept

all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but

it's a little big.

ADELE

Oh...

LUKE

I shouldn't have worn the suit.

ADELE

No... you were wearing that suit

the last time we went out before...

LUKE

Oh...

ADELE

... and It's just... well, deja vu.

LARDNER

That's it.  Deja vu.

LARDNER

You kids off to the dance?

LUKE

Aren't you coming?

LARDNER

No, I'm not much of a dancer.

ADELE

(chidingly)

Besides, Daddy's still trying to

figure out how to get his new

television set working.

LARDNER

I had it, a minute ago...

LARDNER

... ooooh, It's back.

(encouraging them toward

the door)

Well, you kids have fun now...

LARDNER

Aw, crap.

ADELE

This is strange.  Do you feel it?

LUKE

What?

ADELE

We've done this before, so many

times.  The last time was so long

ago, but it feels like yesterday.

LUKE

Oh.

ADELE

You know, everyone's so excited

about the Bijou re-opening...

LUKE

(interrupting)

It's gonna cost over nine hundred

dollars to open the place, Delly.

ADELE

(shocked)

Nine hundred...

LUKE

Yeah, and needless to say, none of

us has that kind of money lying

around.

ADELE

What about a loan?  You could go to

the bank...?

LUKE

A loan to a man who ran his

business into the ground and his

son who can't account for the last

nine-and-a-half years of his life?

Not likely.

ADELE

Well, there's got to be a way...

LUKE

(suddenly)

Have you got a cigarette?

ADELE

When did you start smoking?

LUKE

I don't smoke?

ADELE

You tried to once.  It was pretty

pitiful.

LUKE

Oh.

CUT TO:

LUKE

(nodding toward the band)

They're not bad.

ADELE

No, they're not.  I'd say your

investment was paying dividends.

LUKE

My what?

ADELE

Back in '37, you heard Benny

Goodman play for the first time, so

you went out and got a used

clarinet.  You wanted nothing more

than to be able to play like him.

You tried hard, but it wasn't long

before it was clear that Benny

Goodman would never be looking over

his shoulder.  So you gave the

clarinet to Spencer.

LUKE

Huh.  That was nice of me.

ADELE

You had a hidden agenda, though.

See, when he was five or six,

little Spence used to follow you

around like a puppy.  Bothered the

hell out of you.  But as soon as

you gave him the clarinet...

LUKE

... he started practicing, and he

left me alone from then on.

ADELE

Exactly.  And he got good.

LUKE

No kidding.

ADELE

Now, did you remember that, or...

LUKE

Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.

ADELE

Oh.  Okay.

CUT TO:

ALEX

You're the luckiest guy in town,

Luke.  Delly's 'bout the prettiest

thing ever come outta Lawson.

LUKE

(to Alex)

Thanks, Charlie.

ALEX

I'm Alex.  He's Charlie.

CHARLIE

I'm Charlie.

ALEX

Yessir, 'bout the prettiest thing

we ever seen, ain't that right,

Charlie?

CHARLIE

You bet.

ADELE

(ala Mae West)

Thanks boys, ya flatter me no end.

CHARLIE

Hey, she's doin' that movie star,

what's her name...?

ALEX

(ignoring his brother)

Hey, Delly, what was that test you

was outta town takin'?

ADELE

It's called the State Bar Exam.

CHARLIE

Shoot!

ALEX

Imagine that, Charlie!  A lady

bartender!

CUT TO:

LUKE

How do you tell those two apart,

anyway?

ADELE

Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is

the smarter one.

LUKE

That's... pretty frightening.

ADELE

Your dancing's very good.

LUKE

Thanks.

ADELE

It never used to be.  You were two

left feet on the dance floor.  Like

pulling teeth to get you to do a

little box step.

LUKE

Guess I must've learned.

SPENCER

(nervously)

Thanks, folks.  Gee, can you tell

we never played in front of people

before?

SPENCER

Well, this is our first time, and

it's really all because of Luke.  I

mean, it's because of Luke coming

back that we're here tonight -- but

I'm talking about this.

SPENCER

(to Luke)

When you didn't come back, I

learned how to play this so I could

remember you.  And now that you're

back, well, I'll never forget you.

(to the crowd)

Luke gave me this clarinet, but he

gave this night to all of us.

SPENCER

Okay folks, here's Mayor Cole!

ERNIE

Pretty proud of your boy, Avery?

ERNIE

Looks like you might have to find

someone else to mix paint at the

store, 'cause I think Spencer's got

a big career ahead of him.

ERNIE

You know folks, here in Lawson, we

gave a lot for our country.  A lot.

And we never complained and we

never faltered.  And we never

forgot.

ERNIE

We never forgot.  And so when one

of our own came back to us, I gotta

tell you folks, it was like a

miracle.  Luke, seein' you walking

down the street, it was... well, it

was kinda like seein' one of my

boys alive again.  I think I speak

for everyone here when I say that

not a day goes by when we don't

keep our boys' memories alive.  But

Luke, having you back among us...

well, it helps us keep their

spirits alive, too.  God bless you,

son.

ERNIE

All right, enough a'that.  This is

a celebration, so let's have us a

good time -- but not too good a

time, 'cause I see just about every

member of the city council here

tonight, and we have an eight a.m.

council meeting tomorrow morning,

and I expect y'all to be there!

All right, take it away, Spencer!

DISSOLVE TO:

LUKE

Why don't you two get out there and

dance?

HARRY

Oh, no, I...

MRS. TERWILLIGER

I haven't danced with another man

since Mr. Terwilliger passed.

LUKE

When was that?

MRS. TERWILLIGER

Nineteen-oh-nine.

HARRY

Son, we're gonna go.  You two kids

have a lovely time.

ALEX

Delly, can I have a dance?

ADELE

Sure.

FITTS

Luke, you probably don't remember

me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer

here in town.

LUKE

(shakes his hand)

Good to meet you.  Again.

FITTS

Like Ernie said, we're all glad to

have you back.

LUKE

Thanks.

FITTS

And I hear you and Harry are

planning on re-opening the Bijou.

LUKE

We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot

of work.

FITTS

I can only imagine.  You know, I

spoke with your Dad last year about

maybe taking the Bijou off his

hands.  I don't think he gave it

very much thought.

LUKE

Well, he loves the place.  It's his

home.

FITTS

Luke, I'm hopping you can help him

see the reality of the situation.

I'll come to the point.  I want to

buy the property, and I'm prepared

to offer six-thousand dollars for

it.  And that's just for the

property, mind you.  If you want,

I'll leave it to you and your

father to dismantle and liquidate

the building for whatever salvage

value it has, and you keep those

proceeds.  I just want the land.

LUKE

(taken aback)

That's... well, that's very

generous, but if you've already got

a store...?

FITTS

The days of the storefront grocery

are numbered.  I plan on putting up

a free-standing supermarket.

LUKE

(it's an alien word)

A super market.  Huh.

FITTS

You think it over.  No reason to

risk financial ruin for the sake of

a crumbling old building.

FITTS

Good to have you back, Luke.

Last dance, folks!

CUT TO:

HARRY

Beautiful, wasn't it?

LUKE

(softly)

Yes.

HARRY

Well, son, I wish I could've shown

you more, but this is all that's

left.  Just this one reel that

never got sent back from a picture

we showed here a long time ago.

Nineteen twenty-five, to be

exact...

LUKE

Dad, I...

HARRY

(a tiny laugh)

Ha!

LUKE

... what?

HARRY

You know, since you've been back,

that's the first time you've called

me "Dad."

FADE TO BLACK.

LUKE'S VOICE

Harry.  Dad, wake up.  Wake up.

HARRY

(bleary)

Luke... what time is it?

LUKE

Six-thirty.

(smiles)

I thought we'd get an early start.

CUT TO:

VERA

Finally, Roscoe Fitts moved, and

Red Curtis seconded, that the

council form a committee to

investigate the adoption of a new

property taxation structure.

Motion carried, nine to two, one

abstention.

ERNIE

Thanks, Vera.

ERNIE

Well, the chair notes the presence

this morning of Luke and Harry

Trumbo and the rest of the Bijou

staff.  Frankly, the chair notes

the presence of just about anyone

who ever finds their way into one

of these meetings.  G'moring,

folks.

LUKE & THE TRIO

Good morning.

ERNIE

I'm just guessing, but I bet it's

not a sudden interest in Lawson

politics that brings you all here.

LUKE

Well, no...

(clears his throat)

I wanted to thank you all for

giving me such a nice welcome, and

making me feel at home.  But I...

we're... actually here on business

of a sort...

DALEY

Point of order, Mr. Mayor, this

comes under the heading "New

Business," and this is not the

time...

ERNIE

I think we can make an exception

here, Daley.

DALEY

It'll need to be moved and

seconded.

ERNIE

All right, motion to hear the

speaker out of order.

WYATT

Seconded.

ERNIE

Motion on the floor, discussion

open, discussion closed, all those

in favor signify by saying "aye."

ALL

Aye.

ERNIE

Opposed?  Hearing no opposition,

the motion is carried.

ERNIE

Go ahead, son.

LUKE

Thanks.  Well, I'll make this short

and sweet.  The Bijou needs a lot

of repairs, and the truth of the

matter is, Harry, um, that is, Dad

and me, Mrs. Terwilliger and Old

Tim, we can't possible afford them

all.  So, I'd like to ask your help

to... well, to scrounge around a

bit, and see if you have anything

that might help us out.

WYATT

What kinds of things are you

talking about?

LUKE

Oh, paint, brushes, plaster, light

bulbs, yardage, and if you can't

come up with any of that, we can

use some old-fashioned elbow

grease.

FITTS

So... you do intend to fix the

place up after all?

LUKE

Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I

think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit

more than it needs a super market.

And I think Lawson deserves the

Bijou.  There's not a lot that can

be done to help us get past the

pain we've all felt...

LUKE

... but I think a good dose of

magic is as good a place as any to

start.

WYATT

(eagerly)

Motion to encourage the citizenry

of Lawson to help out the Bijou in

any way they can...

DALEY

(a subtle reminder)

... short of the allocation of city

funds...

WYATT

(agreeing)

... short of allocation of city

funds.

DALEY

(enthusiastically)

Seconded!

ERNIE

(brightly)

Motion on the floor, discussion

open, discussion closed, all those

in favor signify by saying "aye."

ALL

AYE!

ERNIE

Hearing no opposition, the motion

is carried!  Congratulations, Luke,

you got yourself a town to help you

out!

CUT TO:

ERNIE

(slowly)

You know, this really ought to be

out where people can see it.

CUT TO:

LUKE

That was beautiful.

MRS. TERWILLIGER

I taught you that.

LUKE

I can play the piano?

MRS. TERWILLIGER

(all fluttery)

Oh dear, yes.  You were an

excellent student, before all that

clarinet nonsense.  You loved

Chopin.  You used to call it

"heaven music."  "Teach me some

heaven music," you used to say.

MRS. TERWILLIGER

Sit.  Play with me.

LUKE

No, I...

MRS. TERWILLIGER

Some of it might come back to you.

MRS. TERWILLIGER

That's good... that's good...

MRS. TERWILLIGER

Really, Luke!  That's no way to

treat Mr. Chopin!

OLD TIM

I taught him that.

LUKE

Get Doc Lardner.

CUT TO:

LARDNER

It's a pretty massive heart attack.

His lungs have filled with fluid,

and, well... it seems as though his

body is just... shutting down.

LUKE

Can we get him to the hospital?

LARDNER

Even if we could, and the move

didn't kill him, there'd be very

little we could do there that we

can't do here.

(puts his hand on Luke's

I'm sorry.

HARRY

(weakly)

Did you... did you...

LUKE

I'm here.

HARRY

Did you... did you...

LUKE

Did I what?

HARRY

(irritated)

Did you fix the damn film?  It

broke in the last reel.

LUKE

I know.  Everyone went home.  We

offered them refunds.

HARRY

Anybody take it?

LUKE

A few.

HARRY

(closes his eyes)

HARRY

I'm not happy about this, mind you,

LUKE

You're not going anywhere, Harry.

Don't tell me, I know about these

I'm not Luke.

ADELE

Oh...

ADELE

(crying)

Oh, god, I knew!  I knew!  I knew

from the start!  I wanted you to be

Luke!  I wanted you to be alive!

You're so much like him, you have

accepted you!  You don't know what

you -- what Luke meant to this

town, suddenly being alive!  You

don't know what this town lost!

You just don't know...

ADELE

I knew you weren't Luke!  And I

tried not to fall in love with you!

And... I don't even know your name!

Oh, god...

LUKE

I fell in love with you, too,

Delly.  Only now I don't know how I

I only think I know how Luke would

No... I can't... I have to... I

DISSOLVE TO:

SAUNDERS

Are you the sheriff?

ELDRIDGE

And I got the uniform to prove it.

SAUNDERS

I'm Special Agent Walter Saunders,

this is Special Agent Steven Brett,

FBI.  May we have a word with you?

ELDRIDGE

(gesturing)

Please, sit.

SAUNDERS

A couple of days ago, a county

flood control maintenance crew

pulled a car out of the Lawson Wash

ocean outlet.  They checked its

registration, and when the owner

was identified, they notified us.

ELDRIDGE

(smiling)

Well, that'd be Luke Trumbo.  Looks

like you boys've solved a little

mystery we've had going on for a

few months.

BRETT

Sir, that's a photo of man named

Peter Appleton.  He's been missing

from Los Angeles for close to three

months now.

ELDRIDGE

What?  No, there's got to be a...

SAUNDERS

Sheriff -- this man is a suspected

communist.

CUT TO:

PETE

Am I under arrest?

ELDRIDGE

Well, no, but these gentlemen would

like to get some answers...

PETE

I don't know what else to tell you.

I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head

and I didn't remember anything

until a few days ago.

SAUNDERS

Now that you remember who you are,

were you planning on telling anyone

your true identity?

PETE

I already have.

SAUNDERS

Who?

PETE

My girlfriend.  If she still is...

SAUNDERS

(checking his notebook)

Would that be Miss Sinclair?

PETE

(ironic smile)

No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm

talking about Adele Lardner.

ELDRIDGE

The doctor's daughter.  She was

Luke Trumbo's sweetheart.

SAUNDERS

Mr. Appleton, I have reason to

believe you're holding something

back, and that just rubs me the

wrong way.

(pause)

Sir, are you a communist?

PETE

(firmly)

No.  Absolutely not.

SAUNDERS

All right.  All right.  We'll see.

Who's that?

ADELE'S VOICE

It's me.

ADELE

Hi.

PETE

Hi.

ADELE

I'm sure a lot of people down in

L.A. are worried sick about you.

PETE

Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people

down in L.A. want a piece of me.

PETE

This Luke was a pretty good guy,

wasn't he?

ADELE

(wistful smile)

Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.

PETE

Well... let me tell you, I'm not

Luke.  I know who I am now, and you

don't.  And... I don't like me very

much.

ADELE

(changing the subject)

You know, it's going to take me a

while to get used to calling you

Pete.

(she takes it for a spin)

Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.

PETE

Thanks, I like it.  I think.

PETE

Delly, I want to do the right

thing.

ADELE

I believe you.

PETE

The truth is, I'm a lot of things,

but communist isn't one of them.

ADELE

But if you only went to one

meeting, why does anyone care?

Besides, why should it even matter

if you were a communist?

PETE

Come on, Delly, look at the country

today.  We're fighting communists

in Korea, we're paranoid about the

Russians, we've got this thing with

the Rosenbergs and the atomic

bomb...

(bitterly)

You think they want "suspected

communists" entertaining the

American public with party

propaganda like, gosh I don't know,

"Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"

ADELE

Forget about all that.  You want to

do the right thing?  Then defend

your name.  If someone says

something about you that's untrue,

you have to stand up and say so.  I

know the law, and the law's on

your side.

PETE

What about you, Delly?

ADELE

I am, too.

PETE

You'll stand by me?

ADELE

Whatever happens.

CUT TO:

REPORTER

I'm here with Mabel Lanier, the

owner of the diner here on Commerce

Street where Appleton often took

meals.  Mrs. Lanier, tell me, what

are your thoughts about having such

a celebrated suspected communist in

your midst all this time?

MABEL

Well, its kinds hard to believe,

'cause Luke -- I mean Peter -- is

such a... I mean, since he's been

back, I've never seen the town so

happy and all.  It's like he gave

us some... I don't know... some

hope, I guess.

REPORTER

What she's referring to folks, is

yet another bizarre twist in this

story.  Not only is Appleton alive,

but he's been suffering from

amnesia and living here in Lawson,

where, due to a startling

resemblance, everyone in town for

the last three months has taken him

for one of Lawson's dead war

heroes, Albert Trumbo...

MABEL

(a catch in her voice)

Luke.  We always called him Luke.

CUT TO:

LEO

The FBI can't arrest you, because

you haven't done anything wrong.

PETE

Well, that's a relief.  I

understand they usually don't let

that stop them.

LEO

However... you're gonna be

subpoenaed to testify before the

Un-American Activities Committee

when they open hearings in Los

Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and

tell them what they want to hear,

they'll clear you.

PETE

And I won't be a communist anymore.

LEO

Exactly.

PETE

So it doesn't make any difference

that I'm not one now, and have

never been one.

LEO

Kid, don't get philosophical with

me.  This is a game, but it's not

your game.  You play by their

rules, or they'll ruin you.  And

they have the power to do it.

ADELE

Doesn't it bother anyone that this

is a perversion of democracy?

LEO

Darling, don't kid yourself.  We

don't have a "democracy" in this

country.  The Declaration of

Independence?  The Constitution?

These are pieces of paper with

signatures on 'em.  And you know

what a piece of paper with a

signature is?  It's a contract.

And you know what a contract is?

Something that can be re-negotiated

at any time.  It just so happens

that the House Un-American

Activities Committee is re-

negotiating the contract this time

around.

LEO

Next time, it might be the FBI.

The time after that, it might be

the President.  But it'll always be

someone.  Count on it.

PETE

That's not the country Luke fought

for.

LEO

Lest we forget, Peter, your own

military career was somewhat less

illustrious than Luke's.

PETE

It's wrong, Leo.

LEO

Peter, don't let that stop you all

of a sudden.

LEO

Here.  When you're called, read

this to them.  Just tell the

bastards what they want to hear,

and we can all get on with our

lives.

THE MAN

Peter Appleton?

PETE

(standing)

You found him.

Peter Appleton, you are hereby

subpoenaed to appear as a witness

House Committee on Un-American

Activities.  You are to appear in

Los Angeles, California, at the

time specified herein.

treasure this always.  Thank you.

OLD TIM

Oh.

PETE

It's about me.

OLD TIM

Oh.

PETE

I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead.

He died in the war.  He's not

coming back, and I'm not him.  I

don't even belong here.  This whole

thing started out as an accident,

and that's all it is.  An accident.

OLD TIM

Oh...

PETE

My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter.

Peter Appleton.

OLD TIM

Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know

that?

PETE

(taken aback)

I thought you...

OLD TIM

I know more than you give me c-c-

credit, that's for sure.  Don't you

see, it don't m-m-matter who you

are?  All that matters is what you

g-g-gave us.  And you can't take

that away now.  You're wrong, Peter

Appleton.  You do belong here.

law on your side.  Don't forget

that.

PETE

I wish you were coming with me.

ADELE

And who's gonna run the projector

PETE

Damn...

Besides, there's something in there

to get very far, it's near the

beginning.

PETE

(clearly touched)

Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll

take good care of this.

ADELE

Just remember two things.  First,

the law is a living thing.  It made

us free and it keeps us free.

Sometimes it gets twisted around by

people for their own purposes.

Sometimes it makes mistakes,

sometimes big mistakes.  But in the

end, the law prevails for the just.

Sometimes, it takes a while.

PETE

Okay.  What's the second thing?

ADELE

I'll be here... if you come back.

LARDNER

This television's a grand little

invention, isn't it?

DOYLE

The agenda for this morning's

special session of the House

Committee on Un-American Activities

shows a number of witnesses, and

I'd like to admonish those that are

here to view the testimony of our

first witness to keep order at all

times, or this chamber will be

closed.  I'm referring especially

to the ladies and gentlemen of the

press.  I hope that's clear.

DOYLE

Call Peter Appleton.

DOYLE

The witness will please stand and

raise his right hand.

DOYLE

Do you swear that the testimony you

are about to give before this

committee of the United States

House of Representatives will be

the truth, the whole truth, and

nothing but the truth, so help you

god?

PETE

I do.

DOYLE

Be seated and state your full name

and place of residence for the

record.

PETE

Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood,

California.

DOYLE

The chair notes that you are

appearing without the benefit of

counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We

certainly hope this means that you

intend to be fully forthcoming with

this committee?

PETE

(faint smile)

I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.

DOYLE

Now, we're informed that you have a

statement you'd like to read, is

that correct?

PETE

(innocently)

A statement?

DOYLE

Yes.  A prepared statement.

PETE

Um... no.  I don't have a statement

at this time.

MRS. TERWILLIGER

I think he's doing very well, so

far.

ADELE

They haven't called out the dogs

yet.

DOYLE (ON TV)

Very well then, the questions will

be asked by the Majority Counsel,

Mr. Clyde.

ADELE

I spoke too soon.

CLYDE (ON TV)

Thank you Mr. Chairman, and thank

you Mr. Appleton, for appearing

today.

CLYDE

Mr. Appleton, you mention that your

home is Hollywood, California.  But

isn't it true that for the last

several months, you've made your

home in a town called Lawson,

California?

PETE

Sir, that is true.

CLYDE

Mr. Appleton, do you know an

"Albert Lucas Trumbo?"

PETE

Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But

I'd like to think I know him.

CLYDE

Is that because you were

masquerading as Luke Trumbo while

you were in Lawson?

PETE

Mr. Clyde you're twisting things

around.  I wasn't masquerading.

Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man

who gave his life for his country.

I just... happen to look a little

bit like him.  That's all.

CLYDE

(referring to notes)

Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was

reported missing in action and is

presumed dead.  I also see that you

were posted stateside during the

war.  Fort Dix?

PETE

Yes, sir.

CLYDE

Well, I'm sure we're all glad to

see you came through it all right.

CLYDE (ON RADIO)

Now, I see that you've been running

a movie theater in Lawson called

"The Bijou," is that also true?

PETE (ON RADIO)

Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson

to run The Bijou, that was... that

was something that just happened.

You see, I was involved in an

accident in Lawson, and I spent

some time recovering there.

CLYDE

Anyone who reads the newspaper is

quite familiar with your...

"accident," Mr. Appleton.  An

accident which, conveniently, came

hard upon your dismissal from

United Pictures.  Tell us, this

"accident" of yours, are we given

to understand that it affected your

memory?

PETE

Yes.

CLYDE

And what is the state of your

memory now?

PETE

I'm sorry, what was the question?

CLYDE

We... appreciate... your little

note of levity, Mr. Appleton, but

this is a very serious matter, and

it merits your fullest attention.

(back to business)

That state of your memory now, Mr.

Appleton?

PETE (ON RADIO)

Sir, are you referring to the fact

that I was suffering from amnesia,

and I've since recovered my memory?

CLYDE

(impatient)

I'm interested in knowing if you

remember things you did in your

past, or if they've been

conveniently "blotted out" as a

result of your "accident."

PETE

(smiling)

Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.

CLYDE

Good.  Good.

(holds up a piece of

paper)

Now, I hold in my hand a

photostatic copy of the attendance

roster for the "Bread Instead of

Bullets Club" of the University of

California, Los Angeles, dated

October 11, 1935.  A copy of this

paper is before you, Mr. Appleton.

Do you recognize it?

PETE

Yes... yes, I do.

CLYDE

Referring to line thirty-seven of

the document, does your printed

name and signature appear there?

PETE

Yes it does.

CLYDE

Mr. Appleton, please tell this

committee what was the nature and

purpose of the "Bread Instead of

Bullets Club?"

PETE

Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what

I knew then, or do you want to know

what I know now?  They're two

different things?

CLYDE

Start with what you knew then.

PETE

Well, I'd direct the attention of

counsel and committee to line

thirty-six of the document, and the

name printed and signed there.

CLYDE

We see it.  For the record, it

reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's

the point of this?

PETE

Well, that's what I knew then.  Or

who I knew, I should say.  You see,

I was trying to court Miss

Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to

impress her.

CLYDE

(grinning)

Are you asking this committee to

believe that you attended a meeting

of a communist party front

organization in order to impress a

girl?

PETE

(slyly)

Well, if you'd seen Miss

Angstrom...

PETE

You asked for the truth.  That's

the truth.  I had no idea what the

meeting was about.  I just sat

through it so I could be near her.

I'm sure even a Majority Counsel

like yourself is familiar with the

concept of impressing a girl.

DOYLE

Chamber will come to order.

CLYDE

All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was

what you knew then.  What do you

know now?

PETE

(takes a deep breath)

Well, I know that I lost my job

because of one meeting I went to

when I was a kid in college.  I

know that I've been branded a

communist, which I'm not, but even

if I was, it shouldn't matter, or

what do we have a Bill Of Rights

for?

CLYDE

Mr. Chairman, the witness is being

non-responsive...

PETE

(passionately)

I know that a lot of good, honest,

decent people, people that I

consider my true friends, feel

betrayed by me, not because of who

and what I am, but because of what

you say I am!  I know that I...

DOYLE

(emphatically)

Mr. Appleton, you will respond to

the questions of this committee

without elaboration or

speechmaking, or the chair will

find you in Contempt Of Congress.

You will not be warned again, is

that clear?

(he lets this sink in,

then)

Continue, Mr. Clyde.

CLYDE

(looking down at his desk)

Mr. Appleton...

CLYDE

Are you now, or have you ever been,

a member of the communist party?

PETE

No, sir.

CLYDE

(holding up the roster)

Are you refuting this evidence and

your previous testimony?

PETE

I'm not refuting anything.

CLYDE

Yet you're contradicting yourself.

You earlier testified that you

attended a meeting of a communist

party-run organization, yet you

just said, under oath, that you

were not now -- nor ever -- a

member of the communist party.

PETE

That's not a contradiction at all,

sir.  I went to the meeting, but I

didn't go as a member.

CLYDE

Well, then, as what did you go?

PETE

I'm a little hesitant to say.

DOYLE

The witness need not be hesitant to

say anything before this committee,

as long as it's the truth.

PETE

Well, I went as... a horny young

man.

ELDRIDGE

Damn, he don't wanna spar with

these boys.  They'll eat him alive.

DOYLE

(angry)

Mr. Appleton, you are making light

of a legally constituted committee

of the United States Congress.

Believe you me, you do not want to

incur our wrath.

PETE

(matter-of-factly)

I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention

of making light of this committee.

And I have no intention of

incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman.

I have a few friends who have

already incurred your wrath.

They've sent me letters from jail.

CLYDE

(interrupting)

Mr. Chairman!  Mr. Chairman, the

witness is making another speech.

I would ask that Mr. Appleton be

admonished...

DOYLE

(indifferent)

Mr. Appleton, there is no question

before you at this time, but I'm

sure Mr. Clyde has plenty more

prepared, and if you'd like to

either answer them or plead the

Fifth Amendment, we can at least

get on with the business of this

committee.

ADELE

Tell them Pete.  Tell them...

PETE (ON TV)

(wrestling with this)

Mr. Chairman, as I understand it,

the Fifth Amendment pertains to

self-incrimination, and I can't

incriminate myself because I've

done nothing wrong.  Besides,

incrimination is why you have Mr.

Clyde working for you.

CLYDE (ON TV)

Mr. Chairman...

DOYLE

Well then, Mr. Appleton, just what

is your intention?

PETE (ON TV)

I... Mr. Chairman, I have a

prepared statement I'd like to

read...

ADELE

Oh, Pete.  No...

DOYLE

Go ahead, Mr. Appleton.

PETE

(slowly reading)

"I, Peter Appleton, do hereby..."

DOYLE

Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?

PETE

I... I need a drink of water.

DOYLE

Go ahead, son.

PETE

Mr. Chairman... there's... another

Amendment... that I'd like to

invoke at this time, but it's not

the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if

you're familiar with it.

DOYLE

Mr. Appleton, you will...

PETE

"Congress shall make no law

respecting an establishment of

religion, or prohibiting the free

exercise thereof; or abridging the

freedom of speech, or of the press;

or the right of the people

peaceably to assemble, and to

petition the Government for a

redress of grievances."

PETE

That's the First Amendment, Mr.

Chairman.  It's the backbone of

this nation.  It's everything that

gives us the potential to be right

and good and just -- if only we'd

live up to that potential.  It's

what gives me the right to sit in

this chair and say my piece before

this committee without fear.  It's

the most important part of the

contract that every citizen has

with this country.  And even though

this contract...

(he holds up the book)

... the Constitution and the Bill

of Rights -- even though they're

just pieces of paper with

signatures on them -- they're the

only contracts we have that are

most definitely not subject to

renegotiation.  Not by you, Mr.

Chairman, not by you, Mr. Clyde,

not by any member of this committee

-- or anyone else -- ever.

PETE

And when you get right down to it,

that's really all I have to say to

this committee.  Good morning.

DOYLE

The witness will resume his seat!

Did you hear me?!  You are not

excused, Mr. Appleton!

CLYDE

Mr. Chairman!  Mr. Chairman...!

DISSOLVE TO:

FIRST REPORTER

(seeing Pete)

There he is!

SECOND REPORTER

Pete!  Are you going back to

writing pictures?

PETE

I don't know...

THIRD REPORTER

You a commie, Pete?

PETE

No, of course not...

SECOND REPORTER

What about the girl, Pete?  You

gonna marry her?  Is she coming to

Hollywood, or are you...

PETE

Look, fellas, I don't have anything

to say...

LEO

Come on, kid.

LEO

That was quite a show you gave them

today.  We shoulda sold tickets.

PETE

I'm not sorry for what I said.

LEO

No, of course not, why should you

be sorry?  You're the new Peter

Appleton.  You exercised your

rights as a solid citizen, first

amendment, freedom of speech, all

that.  Very noble.

LEO

Cigarette?

PETE

No thanks.

LEO

When'd you quit smoking?

PETE

Luke didn't smoke.

LEO

Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke.

You're Peter Appleton, the picture

writer.

PETE

(laughs)

Not any more.

LEO

Why not?

PETE

Leo, you were in there, you saw

what I did.  You think they're

gonna let me write pictures?  Hell,

they're probably gonna throw my ass

in jail.

LEO

(with a smile)

Not at all.

PETE

Besides, I don't even know if I

want to write anymore.

LEO

(snickering)

What, you're going to go back to

that hick town and run the

projector and marry the doctor's

daughter?

LEO

Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches

and get deals made for guys like

you.  That's what I do.  You're a

writer.  You write pictures.

That's what you do.  And trust me,

you'll be back doing it again

tomorrow morning.

PETE

What do you mean?

LEO

Kid, you gave them what they

wanted.  This committee, it feeds

on names.  The more names, the

better.  But for some high-profile

witnesses, like yourself, any name

will do.

PETE

Leo, I didn't give them the names.

I wouldn't do that.

LEO

What, all of a sudden, "Lucille

Angstrom" isn't a name?

PETE

(warily)

Her name was right there in front

of them.  They gave it to me, I

didn't give it to them.

LEO

Well, that's not what they think.

PETE

Leo, she was... she was a girl I

knew in college...

LEO

You should keep track of your old

school chums.  Turns out she

eventually joined the communist

party.

(takes a puff)

On top of which, she's Lucy

Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she

happens to be a writer for "Studio

One" on CBS.

PETE

(realization dawning)

Oh god, oh, god, no, I...

LEO

So, our lawyers had a talk with the

Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin

Clyde fella won't be too happy

about it, but we cut a deal.

They cleared you -- and they're

gonna thank you publicly for your

testimony purging yourself.

PETE

Thank me publicly?  For what?  For

ruining this woman's life?

LEO

(dismissive)

Climb down off your cross.  They

already knew about her.

(off his look)

She was subpoenaed six months ago!

Who the hell do you think named

you?

LEO

(he couldn't be happier)

All of which means... "Ashes To

Ashes" is gonna be made, and you've

got your job back.

(takes a puff)

Congratulations, kid.

LEO

Peter!  Your hat!

LEO

I was lookin' out for you all the

time, kid.  You did good.  I'm real

proud of you.

(to the driver)

Okay, let's go.

(to Pete)

Get some rest, kid!

CUT TO:

SUPER

(handing him a key)

Here's a new key for ya.  That Mr.

Kubelsky, he's got you paid up

through this month.  You got one

swell friend there.

SUPER

Good to have you back, Pete.

PETE

Thanks...

TO DELLY,

THE GIRL WITH ALL THE ANSWERS.

LOVE, LUKE

PETE

Western Union, please.

PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)

Dear Adele, on my way back to

Lawson STOP.  That is, if they'll

have me STOP.  Train arrives four

p.m. STOP.  Hope you can be there

STOP.  Pete.

DISSOLVE TO:

WELCOME HOME PETE!

LAWSON'S FAVORITE SON

BOB

Luke... um, I mean, Pete, if it

weren't for you, I wouldn't have

had the nerve to ask this fine

woman to marry me.

PETE

Bob, congratulations!  When'd you

ask her?

MABEL

Holy moley!  Just now!

(to Bob)

Yes, Bob!  Yes!

PETE

I see you got the telegram.

ADELE

Pete, I'm so sorry about what they

did to you.  I didn't think you'd

come back, I thought you'd want to

write again...

PETE

Dell, I can't write unless I'm

happy, and I can't be happy unless

I'm here -- and with you.

(grabs her shoulders)

This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton.

And I love you!

ADELE

(tears in her eyes)

And (hic!) I love you, Pete!

PETE

(smiling)

C'mon, Dell, we gotta go.  Showtime

in fifteen minutes.

PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)

"Happily ever after" is a relative

term, folks.  My world is much

smaller now, and my dreams are very

different than they were.  But I

have something now that I never had

before: I have the magic.  And

it's for sale at the Bijou, every

day of the year.  All you need is

the price of a ticket.

THE END

CUT TO BLACK.
