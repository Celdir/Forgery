FADE IN:

SAM COOKE'S AUDIENCE (O.S.)

Oh, yeah!

2.

LSG BOARD MEMBER

(reading)

"...the successor trustee shall be

fully authorized to pay or disperse

such sums from the income or

principal as may be required."

(beat)

Do you understand so far, Mr. Clay?

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

Uh, yes, I do.

LSG BOARD MEMBER

Are you sure, sir?

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

Yeah.   I follow you.

3.

LSG BOARD MEMBER

Okay. 'Cause I'd be happy to

explain any of these terms.

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

No, thank you.

LSG BOARD MEMBER

Thank you, sir.

SONNY LISTON

(whispers; low)

Gonna fuck you up. Gonna beat you

like I's your daddy...

4.

ANGELO DUNDEE

TIME!

5.

MALCOLM X (O.S.)

...and those of you who think you

came here to hear us tell you, like

these Negro leaders do, that times

will get better and we shall

overcome someday, I tell you: you

came to the wrong place.

MALCOLM X (CONT'D)

'Cause your times will never get

better until yo make them better.

And any of you who think you came

here to hear us tell you to turn

the other cheek to the brutality of

the white man and the established

system of injustice in this country,

to beg for your place at their

lunch counter, I say again! You

came to the wrong place.

MALCOLM X (CONT'D)

(beat)

'Cause we don't teach you to turn

the other cheek. We don't teach

you to turn the other cheek in the

South. We don't teach you to turn

the other cheek in the North. The

Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches

you, instead, to obey the law. To

carry yourselves in a respectable

way. And a proud Afro-American way.

But at the same time...we teach

you...that anyone who puts his hand

on you? Do your BEST...to see he

doesn't PUT HIS HAND on

any...body...else...AGAIN.

6.

ANGELO DUNDEE

(approving; past newspaper)

Yeah. Like that, Daddy. Don't

jump in one place. Bad for the

heart. That's the most important

thing.

(without looking)

TIME!

ANGELO DUNDEE

TIME!!!

7.

CASSIUS/BUNDINI

(shout)

Float like a butterfly! Sting like

a bee! Rumble, young man, rumble.

Aaaaaaargh!

CASSIUS

Sonny Liston: you ain't no champ!

You a chump!

(beat)

You want to lose your money, bet on

Sonny. He know I'm great. He will

go in eight!

CASSIUS (CONT'D)

What you lookin' at, you ugly bear?!

8.

CASSIUS (CONT'D)

C'mon, bum. I whup you right here!

A MAN

(reading)

...210... Cassius Clay weighs 210

pounds.

CASSIUS

(changes down)

You sure you got that right...?

THE MAN

218. Sonny Liston...the heavyweight

champion of the world weighs 218

pounds...

BUNDINI

Pounds of what?!

CASSIUS

Pounds of ugly! He so ugly, sweat

run backwards off his forehead to

get away from his face! C'mon,

bear! I turn you into a rug!!

Rumble right now, man!

SONNY LISTON

(low)

Keep talkin', punk-ass faggot!

I'll fuck you up like I's your daddy...

CASSIUS

You whup me, I'll crawl out of the

ring on my knees and catch the next

jet plane out of the country.

JIMMY CANNON

(older reporter)

That a promise?

9.

CASSIUS

(to Jimmy Cannon)

...you be the first eatin' his words!

THE DOCTOR

(alarmed, to Pacheco)

210 over 110?! I can't let him in

the ring in this condition!

REPORTERS

(shout)

Liston says he'll talk with his

fists. "Lip from Louisville."

(laughter)

...odds 7:1 against you. Big bet's

whether he'll knock you out in the

first round or third round or kill

you altogether. You scared of him?

CASSIUS

I'm scared of no man. I give Sonny

Liston talking lessons, boxing

lessons and falling down lessons.

CANNON/OTHERS

Yeah, sure. Are you a Black Muslim?

Pat Putnam in the Miami Herald said...

CASSIUS

"Black Muslim"'s a press word...

ANGELO DUNDEE

Man's religion's his own business.

What kinda question's that?

REPORTERS/HOWARD COSELL

Does he hate white people? Malcolm

X was in town. Then he left. Was

that so he wouldn't embarrass you?

Liston cannot stand you...

ANGELO DUNDEE

(sees)

Howard!

10.

HOWARD COSELL

...cannot stand you, Cassius.   He

really wants to kill you...

CASSIUS

Howard Cosell, you are an instigator!

(Cosell smiles)

How you get that way? When I'm

done with Liston, I'm comin' for you!

DOCTOR

(to Pacheco)

It doesn't come down, I cancel this

fight. You call me in an hour with

his blood pressure.

BUNDINI

(entering)

I'm called Bundini, rhymes with

Houdini. He was a Jew, too...some

other people call me Fastblack...or

Daddy Mac...

11.

BUNDINI (CONT'D)

(motions at lounge

chair)

Shorty sent me to Sugar Ray

Robinson. I gave my power to Sugar

Ray for seven years, gave him my

voodoo, my magic. Now Shorty sent

me to you.

CASSIUS

Who Shorty?

BUNDINI

I call him Shorty 'cause he like

'em circumcised. Original people.

Like Moses. And I was a babe in a

basket, too. I was born on a

doorstep with a note 'cross my

chest that read, "Do the best you

can for him, world." I had to suck

the first nipple come along. I

didn't run away from home...I been

runnin' to home.

BUNDINI (CONT'D)

(beat, and his raison d'etre)

Now, I gotta ask you. You fixin'

them fights? Else no way you could

tell great Archie Moore what round

you droppin' him in...all of them

predictions you make, comin' true.

Never heard of nobody predictin'

the round like you. You either a

phony or Shorty's in your corner.

Tell me the truth, young man...

CASSIUS

...I study every fight. 'Til I got

a plan. Wear him down two through

four. Drop him in the fifth round.

So the p'diction ain't a p'diction.

It's a plan. And 'cause of all the

poppin' off I do, I know I gotta

win! That's the truth. And why

I'm tellin' you?

12.

BUNDINI

'Cause I'm gonna be your Inspiration.

Your motivator. In your corner.

Can I be in your corner, young man?

CASSIUS

(thinks, then)

Yeah...

BUNDINI

(inexplicably moved,

covers)

Ain't spent much time in Miami.

Where the water?

PACHECO

120 over 80?

(re: his blood

pressure)

You should be asleep...

CASSIUS

When you get back?

MALCOLM X

Just now.    I'm front row, seat 7.

RUDY

I'm gonna find Mom and Dad.

13.

CASSIUS

You could have stayed. Nobody

gotta hide when they with me.

MALCOLM X

Nothing wrong with being cool, my

brother. You been working toward

this moment for four years.

ANGELO DUNDEE

(while tying)

He's right.

MALCOLM X

It's a crusade in modern times.

And television is beaming if off

Telstar to the whole world. So

Allah has brought this about for a

reason...

(time to leave)

Salaam alaikum, my brother...

14.

15.

CASSIUS

He was supposed to kill me.   Well,

I'm still alive.

16.

ANNOUNCER

(at ringside, on radio)

He's opened a cut on Liston.

Liston's never been cut!

CASSIUS

(to Dundee)

He's nothin' to me...

CASSIUS (CONT'D)

And he knows it...

17.

CASSIUS

...my eyes!

CASSIUS

(shouting)

My eyes! I can't see...somethin'

in my eyes!

CASSIUS

(his gloves)

Cut 'em off! Cut 'em!   I'm blind.

ANGELO DUNDEE

No. You quit, it's over! Get out

there. Be a yardstick. This is

the big one, daddy. Get out there

and run!

18.

HOWARD COSELL

(doing color radio

commentary with Les

Kelter's blow-by-blow)

...Clay, a round ago, looked like

he'd about had it, but in round six...

HOWARD COSELL (CONT'D)

(realizing, screaming)

Sonny Liston is not coming out!

Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

Sonny Liston is not coming out!

19.

HOWARD COSELL (CONT'D)

The winner...and the new heavyweight

champion of the world is Cassius Clay!

CASSIUS

I upset the world! I am the

greatest! I am the greatest!

CASSIUS (CONT'D)

(to press)

Eat your words! Eat your words!

HOWARD COSELL

What made him so easy for you?

CASSIUS

I told you. Didn't I tell you?

HOWARD COSELL

Was there any single point you knew

you had him?

CASSIUS

I had him in the first round.

'Cause I'm the greatest!

(and seeing at ringside,

calling him up)

Sam... Hey, Sam! Let him up.

CASSIUS (CONT'D)

I am the greatest! And he the

greatest rock 'n' roll singer. Sam

Cooke! I want everybody to bear

witness.

(they embrace)

I shook up the world! Don't have a

mark on me! I was burning. I was

blind. I'm the prettiest thing

that ever lived. I shook up the

world! I shook up the world!

20.

GORDON DAVIDSON

...I don't care what should have

been ordered! We need a victory

party right now.

(pause)

I got national press, the family,

the champ, all kinds of folks...

(beat)

250 to 300. Yes.

21.

GIRL

Why's he so scared?

MALCOLM X

Man, look at that guy run!

CASSIUS

The Mummy! "I can't get away from

the mummy!" Yeah, but that mummy

too slow to catch anybody.

SAM COOKE

Hey!   The mummy always gets his man...

CASSIUS

No, he don't!

(to kid)

Now, don't believe that stuff on

television...

22.

A REPORTER

The people look to you. Do you

plan on being a people's champ,

like Joe Louis?

CASSIUS

(tentative)

Yeah. I going to be a people's

champ...

(beat)

But not like Joe Louis, exactly...

A REPORTER

(starts)

Mr. Clay...?

CASSIUS

And I'm not Clay. Clay's the name

of the people who owned by

ancestors. I don't want to be

called after that slave name no

more. So I'm "X." Cassius X. And

I'm a member of the Nation of Islam.

The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is my

spiritual guide. Malcolm X is my

mentor.

REPORTERS

(all at once)

You a card-carrying member?    Aren't

Black Muslims a hate group?

23.

CASSIUS

(droll)

"Card-carrying"...? Don't need no

"card." You got a Christian card?

750 million people believe in Islam.

I'm one of them.

ANOTHER REPORTER (O.S.)

Minister Malcolm...what about the

reports of a split between you and

Elijah Muhammad?

MALCOLM X

This is the champ's time. And I'm

here as a friend to celebrate his

victory. So I got nothing you want...

CASSIUS

I'm going to be a people's champion.

But I don't have to be the way you

want me to be. I'm gonna be what I

want. And I'm free to think any

way I want...

MALCOLM X

I was leaving, saw the light

on...how come you're up?

CASSIUS

(mumbles, half-asleep)

...watchin' a show on

termites...they knockin' down this

house, here.

24.

MALCOLM X

I been invited to speak at Ibadan

University in Nigeria. C'mon with me?

CASSIUS

Six million in your house and you

don't know it. Where?

MALCOLM X

Africa.   You been there?

CASSIUS

Africa? No. Only Rome.      Yeah, man,

let's go!

MALCOLM X

Nkrumah stayed with me when he was

a student in New York, so we'll

stop in Ghana...

CASSIUS

When we leaving?

MALCOLM X

Next Thursday.

CASSIUS

(sees)

What is it?

MALCOLM X

You ever been so angry...have you

ever been so angry that you'd explode?

CASSIUS

(after a beat)

Tore out a picture of Emmett Till

when I was little. Couldn't take

my eyes to it...couldn't look at it.

Barb-wire around his neck to a 75-

pound cotton-gin fan. Took out his

eye. The cruelty to it...I

couldn't look at it...couldn't

throw it away.

MALCOLM X

What else?

25.

CASSIUS

I thought, "What I do wrong to be

so low that people could do that to

people like me?" It made me feel

ashamed. And that makes no sense.

But that's what it was.

MALCOLM X

...when I heard about the four

girls bombed in the 16th Street

Church in Birmingham?

(beat)

The prohibitions of the Honorable

Elijah Muhammad prevented me from

speaking my voice in action.

Because Birmingham was part of the

civil rights movement, begging for

a place at the white man's table...

But dead children...are dead

children. So the anger I felt, I

had to contain. I locked that down!

So tight my muscles seized. I lost

control over the right side of my

body. Leg didn't work...right arm

didn't work. "I'm having a stroke,"

I thought. I had to hold it in

'cause I wanted, all I wanted was

to BREAK SOMETHING! Break a

part...any part of this system.

Because you are so provoked as a

human being. In your spirit. In

your heart... At the death of

children. But I COULD DO...nothing.

MALCOLM X (CONT'D)

(putting his glasses

back on)

Everyone knows... Now I'm

advocating more direct political

action involvement with the

international struggle... So

Elijah Muhammad has suspended me as

a Minister in the Nation of Islam

for 90 days.

CASSIUS

You can fix that...

MALCOLM X

I don't know. I will try when we

get back. Until then I will live

each day as if I am already dead.

26.

ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

Only after long service and high

merit in the spiritual and physical

rebirth of Afro-American people...is

one granted an original name. But

you are special. A world champion.

So there is a gift I wish to give

you. From this day forward you

will be known as Muhammad

Ali...which means "one worthy of

praise," and Ali means "most high."

CASSIUS

(a beat, sounding it)

Muhammad Ali.

(humble)

"Worthy of praise..." Thank you!

ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

(cautioning)

Be very careful what you say...your

words reflect on the nation of

Islam, now.

CASSIUS

Yes, sir.

ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

(after a beat)

Up until now, I have entrusted your

spiritual development to Brother

Malcolm.

(beat)

I do not feel this is a wise course

anymore.

27.

ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (CONT'D)

Malcolm has gone off into the

secular world and does not measure

his words. I have decided to give

you, as your guide, my very own son,

Herbert Muhammad.

ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (CONT'D)

Herbert will supervise all of your

spiritual and material needs.

CASSIUS

(not a thought)

This is a great honor, Messenger...

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

Why you want to change?

A NEIGHBOR (V.O.)

(to Ali)

Could we get a picture with you?

(to Cassius, Sr.)

You mind, Mr. Clay?

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

What's wrong with the lawyers and

managers you got?

28.

A NEIGHBOR

One more.

(click)

Thank you.

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

Yeah, yeah...

CASSIUS CLAY, SR. (CONT'D)

You got...I got you the best white

men I could find. Right here in

L'ville...

ALI

When the contract run out. I want

black lawyers and managers.

Chauncey Eskridge on North La Salle

Street...

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

(angrily)

They saved you from the gangsters,

from the jackals and the hyenas of

boxing. Never cheated you.

Protected you with a trust fund...

ALI

I don't need no "protectin'" from

myself. Why I need protecting from

myself by them...?

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

And now I got to go tell them,

"Piss off. Cassius don't want you

around no more."

ALI

I ain't one of their thoroughbreds!

Or their charity things. "Let's do

somethin' for that well-behaved

colored boy, Cassius." I ain't

well-behaved nothing! I am a man.

ALI (CONT'D)

And I am not Cassius. I changed my

name. I am Muhammad Ali, now.

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

You what?

29.

ALI

That's right.

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

(stunned)

What? What's wrong with...our name,

my name...? We're...we made you.

We...

ALI

No one "made me"...

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

No bow-tie-wearin', Arab-talkin'

nigger gonna change that...

ALI

(anybody's son)

I made me.

(adamant)

No one's in that ring but me!

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

You don't know who you are...

ALI

I know who I'm not...I'm not

drinkin'! Goin' back on my wife!

I am not prayin' to no blue-eyed,

blonde-haired Jesus. I ain't...

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

Paintin' blue-eyed, blonde-haired

Jesuses and signs on cars is what

put steak and vegetables in you,

clothes on you...

ODESSA CLAY

...dinner!

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

(cold)

Go ahead!

CASSIUS CLAY, SR. (CONT'D)

Go ahead.

30.

ODESSA CLAY

You didn't get it from me...your

words, your sense of humor, what

makes you angry, what makes you a

fighter. You got that from your

daddy...

ALI

You saying I'm just like him?

ODESSA CLAY

I'm saying, if he was your age

today, he'd do the same as you.

And he knows that.

ONE OF HIS CHILDREN (OVER)

Daddy...    For you...

JOSEPH 13X (V.O.)

Brother Malcolm...

MALCOLM X

What is it, Joseph?

JOSEPH 13X (V.O.)

The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has

given the Muslim name, Muhammad Ali,

to Cassius X. Herbert Muhammad's

been placed in charge of his

training, instead of you.

(and ultimately)

Muhammad Ali will not be traveling

with you to Africa.

JOSEPH 13X (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has

asked me to inform you your

suspension has been extended

indefinitely.

31.

BETTY SHABAZZ

(concerned for her husband)

Malcolm?

MALCOLM X

(after a beat, disconsolate)

Cassius won't be coming to

Africa...not with me.

BETTY SHABAZZ

Go anyway. Don't put it off.      It's

not safe here.

ONE OF HIS CHILDREN (OVER)

(calling)

Mommy...the bath's ready...

CUT TO:

ALI

(joking)

Hey, man, where they put the real

pilot? What you doin' up here?

PILOT

(not understanding;

British accent)

I am...the pilot. He's the

copilot...

(moves map case)

Here, Mr. Clay, sit down...

ALI

No, man, I meant...in L'ville, when

I growed up, they barely let black

folks drive buses.

32.

THE PILOT

Here we are. Cote d'Ivoire...Africa.

CUT TO:

BETTY SHABAZZ (V.O.)

We should think of a name, Malcolm...

MALCOLM X (V.O.)

How about Gamilah or Khalilah?

MARLIN THOMAS

(eating)

Anything?

THE MAN

...on the phone with his wife.

She's having a hard time

sleeping...baby's kicking a lot...

MARLIN THOMAS

Motor Pool, here, have a Chevy

parts catalogue...?

CUT TO:

33.

CUT TO:

MALCOLM X

(shouts)

Brother Muhammad...

ALI

Hey, man!!!

ALI (CONT'D)

How you doin'? What's up, brother?

I knew you were here...didn't think

you were still here...

MALCOLM X

And I heard you were coming.

34.

ALI

We just got here now...

(words rush out)

And, maaan, the brothers were flyin'

a DC 8. Flippin' switches,

navigatin', filing flight plans,

talkin' French...

ALI (CONT'D)

Where you goin'?

MALCOLM X

When...uh, Liberia.   When you

fighting Liston?

ALI

November.

MALCOLM X

This is Maya Angelou and Ambassador

Huang Ha. Amando Gonzalez is from

Cuba. Taher Kaid is the Ambassador

from Algeria.

ALI

Man, where should I go?   We're

planning on Egypt.

MALCOLM X

Algeria. See Ben Bella...

(beat)

Go to Mecca, Medina. I just came

back. Made my seven circuits

around the Kaaba, prayed at

sunrise... There were two million

people...pilgrims from all over.

Dressed all the same, high and low,

the same. Blonde-haired, blue-eyed

Muslims. Arabs.

(off Ali's look of

surprise)

Blacks. Yeah. All of them,

Muslims praying together.

35.

BRADLEY (V.O.)

Hello...?

MALCOLM X

It's Marlin. You'll never guess

who Malcolm ran into...

CUT TO:

BRADLEY

(in French; into phone)

Un moment...

BRADLEY (CONT'D)

(English translation;

into phone)

Hold on a second...

MOBUTU'S MILITARY AIDE

(in French)

Le Ministere de Defense vous remercie.

MOBUTU'S MILITARY AIDE (CONT'D)

(English translation)

The Defense Minister thanks you.

BRADLEY

(in French)

Il n'y a pas de quoi. Cela m'a

fait grand plaisir. Faites-lui mes

compliments.

BRADLEY (CONT'D)

(English translation)

It's nothing. Give him my compliments.

36.

MARLIN THOMAS

Malcolm bumped into Cassius Clay.

Muhammad Ali...whatever he calls

himself...

BRADLEY

I thought that was all over. Is

Clay going to support Malcolm's U.N.

resolution?

MARLIN THOMAS

I don't know.

BRADLEY

Find out. We'll pick up on Malcolm

in Liberia ourselves.

MALCOLM X

Drank from the well of Zem-Zem...

And you should visit Cairo. I have

friends there in...

ALI

(his thoughts)

...shouldn't have quarreled with

the Honorable Elijah...

37.

ALI (CONT'D)

(to himself)

You shouldn't have...

(vocalized)

...quarreled with the honorable

Elijah Muhammad...

MALCOLM X

What?

ALI

You shouldn't have quarreled with

Elijah Muhammad.

MALCOLM X

Brother Muhammad...

MALCOLM X (CONT'D)

Brother Muhammad...!

ALI

Sonji...Sonji Roi...

SONJI

(laughs)

What you keep sayin' my name for?

ALI

'Cause I love it, girl. How long

you been workin' for Herbert?

SONJI

'Bout a year. I sell "Muhammad

Speaks" over the phone...

ALI

What kind of name is that?

38.

SONJI

ALI

SONJI

ALI

SONJI

ALI

SONJI

SONJI

ALI

SONJI

SONJI

What he say?

ALI

He said, "Champ. The more real you

SONJI

Wow...

ALI

Let's go...

SONJI

Yeah...

ALI

(crossing out)

Where you live?

SONJI

I'm takin' you there...

ALI

I think I gonna keep you around

forever, girl.

SONJI

(laughs)

Well, I'm not too busy right now,

so...I'll think on it.

ALI

Herbert said you weren't a Muslim.

SONJI

Cover my hair? No make-up?     Long

dresses? Honey, please.

(beat)

Were you a virgin?

40.

ALI

Why?

SONJI

(laughs)

'Cause you so "gone" off a little

good time.

ALI

I'm no virgin...but I may as well

be.

(beat)

I ain't jokin'! I always know when

I know. See this face? I mean,

you got a pretty face for a girl's

face, but you ever seen somethin'

as pretty as me? Now, you about

five-foot-three...that's too small.

But I overlook that, too, 'cause...

SONJI

(sarcastic)

Thank you so much.

ALI

...'cause of your spirit!

SONJI

My "spirit"...?

ALI

Yeah.   'Cause you too much fun!

SONJI

You serious?

ALI

But you gotta be a Muslim.

SONJI

Huh? How you do that? Step over a

broom...shazaam...you a Muslim?

ALI

Maaan, I ain't never been with a

girl like you.

41.

SONJI

Baby, maybe you ain't ever gonna be

with any other.

HERBERT

What?

ALI

That's right.   I wanna marry her.

HERBERT

You can't marry that girl! She was

a date! Have some fun! She's not

your wife! You don't marry this

girl.

(puts contracts in

front of him)

Sign there. Management papers. My

father will kill me.

BUNDINI

True love!

BINGHAM

Watch what you signing, Ali.

HERBERT

(to Bingham; sharp)

Nothing to do with you.

BINGHAM

You talkin' to me, or someone walk

inna room, fat boy? Anything's do

to with me I think's to d-d-do with

me...I'm st-st-still a Christian.

ALI

(signs anyway)

And get me a kosher cook...lady who

cooks at Malcolm's temple. Put my

brother on the payroll. 50g a year

for drivin' and jivin'.

HERBERT

Lana Shabazz...

42.

ALI

Yeah. How 'bout it, Howard. You be

my official full-time photographer.

BINGHAM

I ain't goin' on your payroll. I

like it freelance. Emphasis on "free."

HERBERT

Muhammad. She's not...for you.

When I met her, she was working at

a cocktail lounge with a bunny tail

on her backside.

BUNDINI

What were you doin' down at a

cocktail lounge, Herbert? Sellin'

"Muhammad Peeks"?

HERBERT

(to Bundini)

Sober up and say something to this

man, Bundini. You supposed to be

his "inspiration."

BUNDINI

(looks at Ali; to

Ali, serious)

I got to know about Sonji, Muhammad.

She got a sister?

(as Ali laughs)

BINGHAM

You been s-s-saving it up, training,

Champ. You can't unleash it on

this girl all sudden. You may kill

her! Maybe you should spread it

around more before you tie it down.

ALI

No. Marriage is the cornerstone of

Muslim life.

HERBERT

Sonji Roi is not a Muslim!

ALI

She gonna be a Muslim, now!

(flashes)

So fix it up, Herbert.

43.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

(mid-statement)

I fear if this bill is not passed...

(beat)

...our nation is in for a dark

night of social disruption.

JOSEPH 13X

Why we meeting?

JOE SMILEY

The idea was...to...make...Malcolm

smaller, you know? Diminished;

obscure? Not to turn him into a

messiah.

(the paper)

What I got, now, is Malcolm

shoulder to shoulder with Martin

Luther King.

(beat)

And Malcolm running all over the

world getting Ben Bella and Nasser

to denounce racism in the U.S.

while we're competing over there

with the Soviets.

(MORE)

44.

JOE SMILEY (CONT'D)

(droll)

Not...a resounding success. We

were better off before, with

Malcolm INSIDE the Nation.

(beat)

So... We want you...to get Elijah

Muhammad...to take Malcolm back.

JOE SMILEY (CONT'D)

That's a joke. I'm kidding! Don't

you ever smile?

JOE SMILEY (CONT'D)

We're on a timetable. Malcolm's

pal, Quaison from Ghana, is

introducing Malcolm's resolution to

the General Assembly in Washington.

That's in five weeks.

JOSEPH 13X

You got bad breath, man.

JOE SMILEY

Thyroid. I got a stab wound in

1961. They took it out. We gotta

talk about this guy, too.

JOSEPH 13X

When do I get my expenses

reimbursed...dry cleaning lots of

suits isn't free...

45.

ALI

(to Bundini)

What you drinkin'?

BUNDINI

What am I drinkin'? Water's what

I'm drinkin', champ! I'm a natural

man...

ALI

What's goin' on?     We're late.

SONJI (V.O.)

I'm changing my damn clothes! You

didn't like what I was wearin'!

BUNDINI

Come on in...!

(sees)

What's that?

ROOM SERVICE

(with large glass)

What you wanted, isn't it...a water

glass with vodka...?

BUNDINI

That was before...

ROOM SERVICE

Before what?

BUNDINI

Before you showed up...

SONJI

I fine runnin' around in all these

cute short things for you. I

submissive to you. But I ain't

gonna be submissive to the Brother

X's and what they think. They

askin' me questions alla time anyway.

46.

ALI

What questions?!

SONJI (V.O.)

About you and us and I ain't tellin'

'em shit.

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

(drunk)

Tell it like it is, sugar! They

took my boy's name...and what they

give him back? Bad style.

SONJI

I don't drink. I don't smoke. I

converted to Islam for you and...

SONJI

All except the dress! I ain't

puttin' no bleached-out, double-

ugly bedsheets on this body, honey!

I'm normal!

DADDIO

(on radio)

Hey there, old, aware ones. And

you, too, my fair ones...This is

"Daddio's Jazz Patio." ON KBCA

this fine day, which is A-okay...

47.

MALCOLM X

As-Salaam Alaikum...

THE GATHERED

Wa-Alaikum-Salaam...

A YOUNG MAN

(shouts)

What you doin' in my pockets, man?

Get your hand outta my pocket!

MALCOLM X

Hold it, hold it, brothers!

(pleading)

Let's be cool.

48.

CRAZY MAN

Ambushed!

CRAZY MAN (CONT'D)

From the bullet holes, black eagles

flew! They screaming through the

streets...

ALI

What?

CRAZY MAN

(dazed)

They killed Malcolm...they shot

Malcolm.

49.

ALI

(his thoughts)

You were the first...you walked me

forward, my brother...you were the

first...

SAM COOKE

(sings)

"Been a long, long time comin', but

a change gonna come, yes it is..."

HOWARD COSELL

...the arena is surrounded by FBI,

the stands are only half full, the

promoter has taken out a million-

dollar insurance policy due to

Cassius Clay's membership in the

militant and radical Black Muslims

because of death threats. Oh, and

by the way...Sonny Liston is here, too.

HOWARD COSELL (CONT'D)

Liston is down! Scarcely a minute

into the first round, I can't

believe it!

50.

ALI

Get up, sucker! Get up and fight!

No one gonna believe this!

HOWARD COSELL

It's over; it's over!

SONJI

You okay?

(he's cold)

What's wrong?

ALI

Why you done up like that?

SONJI

I'm dyin' and...'cause this is how

I dress! I dyin' for you out of

worry...

ALI

"Worry"...?

SONJI

Yeah. And all you care about is if

I look dull enough?

ALI

The world looks at me, girl! What

if I straightened my hair, live in

the white suburbs? How I am says

something!

SONJI

(quiet; tough)

Well, sorry you don't like how I am...

51.

ALI

(to Bundini)

Where's Herbert?

ALI

What do I do...?

HERBERT

If you want, have no contact with

her for ninety days. Then you make

a public statement of divorce in

the mosque, and Islamic law will be

satisfied.

BUNDINI

"Satisfied?"...satisfaction is not

makin' it with the woman who send

you to the moon?

BUNDINI (CONT'D)

Man, I'm the only normal person

left around here and I'm a black

Jew who can't read and is half drunk.

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

I gotta talk to you.

ALI

Please stay, Brother Herbert.

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

He ain't your brother! Your

brother taking your wife back to

Chicago. She's crying like a widow.

ALI

I ain't dead!

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

You might as well be. You don't

remember your name or who you are.

52.

COSMETOLOGIST

You got the prettiest eyes...

ALI

Yeah?

BUNDINI

He so pretty, when you look up

"pretty" in the dictionary, he too

pretty to be there.

A.D.

(re: newspaper,

to Ali)

...you gonna try for Germany?

ALI

Huh?

A.D.

You gonna try to get stationed in

Germany?

ALI

What you talking about?

BUNDINI

Champ.   It's Eskridge...

53.

A.D.

(Ali didn't know)

They changed your classification.

(turns page)

It's in the paper...You're 1-A.

You're gonna get drafted into the

Army...

ALI

(takes phone)

You know about this?

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE (V.O.)

Yes. But I think the government's

looking to negotiate a deal...

A.D.

(hears on headset)

Here we go...!

ALI

...I flunk their draft board test.

Now, without testing if I am "wiser"

or "worser," they decide I can go

into the Army.

HOWARD COSELL

Cassius, it is my opinion you...

ALI

(cuts in)

And I'm not Cassius Clay. That's a

slave name. I'm a free man. I'm

Muhammad Ali.

HOWARD COSELL

(stops, realizing)

You know, I apologize to you. On

the air. Your name is Muhammad Ali.

You have the right to be called

whatever you want.

ALI

(stays angry)

You make a lot of mistakes for a

so-called educated man. You really

go to law school?

54.

HOWARD COSELL

Yes, Muhammad. And to think I gave

up a lucrative practice for the

likes of you.

ALI

I'm the best thing that ever

happened to you, Howard Cosell.

Without me you be a tall white man

with a microphone in his mouth.

HOWARD COSELL

(fast)

And without me...you'd be a mouth.

HOWARD COSELL (CONT'D)

(into camera)

We'll be right back.

HOWARD COSELL

(sarcastic)

Have a little coffee with your

sugar...?

ALI

Keep talking. You were saying

something half-smart...

HOWARD COSELL

They want to make an example out of

you.

ALI

Why? I'm no Stokely Carmichael, H.

Rap Brown...

HOWARD COSELL

All they are is political. They

tell people how they ought to be.

But you are the HEAVYWEIGHT

CHAMPION of the WORLD. You're

important. And they don't like

your militancy, your politics. So,

they'll make an example out of you.

55.

ALI

...of a good "Ne-gro," who do what

he told?

HOWARD COSELL

Yes. Or, to demonstrate here is

what happens to your ass if you

don't...

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE

(quietly)

You do six weeks basic...you go

into the Reserves...you don't go to

Vietnam...you get to box...you even

get to keep the money...

HERBERT

(lets him know)

The Messenger would not object if

you joined under these terms.

ALI

I stay out of jail and I get to fight.

HERBERT

(nods)

All you have to do is accept the

induction. And life goes on.

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE

They call your name. You say yes.

56.

LT. JEROME CLARIDGE

...and you will take one step

forward as your name and service

are called, and such a step will

constitute your induction into the

Armed Force indicated.

LT. JEROME CLARIDGE (CONT'D)

Cassius Marcellus Clay.

LT. JEROME CLARIDGE (CONT'D)

Mr. Clay, I am required to inform

you that refusal to accept a lawful

induction order constitutes a

felony under the Universal Military

Training and Service Act, punishable

by up to five years' imprisonment

and a five-thousand-dollar fine.

Do you understand?

ALI

(nods)

Yes.

LT. JEROME CLARIDGE

(repeats)

Cassius Marcellus Clay.

LT. JEROME CLARIDGE (CONT'D)

(a third time)

Cassius Marcellus Clay.

A MAN

(presenting badge)

Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Mr. Clay, you're under arrest for

refusing induction...

57.

ALI

(listens; to cam.)

Ask Chauncey Eskridge in Chicago.

He's my lawyer. No. I'm out on

bail.

(goes onto balcony

[rear shot])

Yeah, I fight. I fight clean. I'm

an athlete. Army's there to kill,

kill, kill. My religion forbids

that. No. I never shot anything

in my life.

(turns)

Do I know where Vietnam is?

(wry; playing to

Bingham)

Yeah. It's on TV...

(beat)

In southeast Asia? It there, too?

(beat)

That's a joke, man...!

ALI (CONT'D)

(frustrated)

What do I think about who?      Vietcong?

58.

ALI (CONT'D)

Man, I ain't got no quarrel with

them Vietcong.

ALI (CONT'D)

No Vietcong ever called me nigger.

BINGHAM

You know what you j-j-just said...?

LIPSYTE

From Europe to China...every home

in America...the world's gonna know

what the heavyweight champion of

the world said about the U.S. war...

ALI

So what?

(beat)

I ain't gonna be what anybody else

want me to be. I'm not afraid to

be what I want. And think how I want.

LIPSYTE

(reading)

Nixon, the Republicans, Boxing

Commission in New York, Cleveland

and L.A.

(a foregone conclusion)

But you're also getting attacked as

unpatriotic by the NAACP, Roy

Wilkins, Jackie Robinson, the New

York Times and Joe Louis...

59.

ALI

(to Arum)

People are following me...

BOB ARUM

I got almost nowhere I can promote

a fight for you. Plus, I think

they're going to vacate you from

the crown.

ALI

What?

BOB ARUM

Yeah.   If you're convicted.

ALI

They gonna take away what no

fighter in the world can?

BOB ARUM

And New York may revoke your boxing

license.

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE

You sure you want to do all this?

(politics)

Your next three to four years are

every heavyweight's prime. And

there are few of those years...

ALI

What 'bout Terrell?

BOB ARUM

We'll know if we can fight Terrell

in Illinois this afternoon.

Terrell's running his mouth. He

said if you're called, you should

serve...

60.

ALI

(angrily)

Motherfucker. He got a deferment

for bein' too tall, or havin' flat

feet. Why don't he serve for me?

Tellin' me what I should do...

BOB ARUM

(to Ali + Eskridge)

I got to get you some fights.    Fast.

COMMISSIONER

You understand we could take away

your license to fight Terrell in

Illinois?

ALI

Yes.

COMMISSIONER

Are you prepared to apologize?

About your unpatriotic remarks that

you made?

ALI

Apologize? No.

COMMISSIONER

You said that you were the people's

champion.

ALI

(angry)

Yes, sir!

COMMISSIONER

Do you think you're acting like the

people's champion...?!

ALI

Yes, sir. I am not going to

apologize to you. This isn't a

courtroom. And I don't have to sit

here and answer your questions.

61.

ALI

I ain't draft dodgin'! I ain't

goin' to Canada. I ain't burnin'

my draft card. I ain't burnin' the

flag. I'm stayin' right here. And

you want to throw me in jail? Go

ahead. I'll do my time. I been in

jail four hundred years. I'll be

in jail four, five more. But I

ain't goin' ten thousand miles to

help murder and kill poor people

for you. 'Cause if I'm gonna die,

I'll die now, right here, fighting

you. If I wanna die. You my enemy,

not Vietcong or Chinese or Japanese.

You my opposer when I want freedom.

You my opposer when I want justice.

You my opposer when I want equality.

You want me to go somewhere for you,

but you won't even stand up for me

in America, for my rights and

beliefs, you won't even stand up

for me here at home.

ERNIE TERRELL

(getting on scale)

Tell Clay he can get on after me.

ALI

What...?

ERNIE TERRELL

Get on the scale after...

ALI

(cuts in)

What you call me...?

62.

ERNIE TERRELL

Only thing I knows you as:   Cassius

Clay!

ALI

(infuriated)

Announce it right here or from flat

on your back!

ALI (CONT'D)

What's my name?!?

ALI

What's my name, motherfucker?!

ALI (CONT'D)

What's my name?

ALI (CONT'D)

WHAT'S MY NAME?!

63.

ALI (CONT'D)

(shouted)

My name?! WHAT'S MY NAME?!

ALI

(to Judge)

If the court would give me my

sentence right now instead of

waiting and stalling.

JUDGE INGRAHAM

(obliges)

My pleasure. The jury has found

you guilty of refusing induction

into the United States armed forces.

I sentence you to the maximum

sentence allowable...five years'

imprisonment and a fine of ten

thousand dollars.

(pause)

Fast enough? Your attorney will

lodge an appeal. While you're out

on bond, I order your passport

surrendered. I'll not have you

benefitting yourself by fighting

abroad...

64.

ALI

Watch now...

ALI (CONT'D)

(offering)

Blow on it...

ALI (CONT'D)

This spooky! Don't get scared...

BELINDA

(laughs)

See, you don't need to fight no more...

65.

ALI

So what's fresh, girl?

BELINDA

(smiles)

Everything fresh!

ALI

(smiles)

What's the freshest of the freshest?

BELINDA

(smiles)

Doughnuts just came out...

ALI

(holds up the

doughnut)

Feed me those things, I gotta come

back as a wrassler.

(a ring announcer)

645 pounds. I'd still be

pretty...but I be fat pretty...

BELINDA

You don't remember when you met me

once before...long ago...

ALI

(joking)

I remember something...   Wha's your

name?

BELINDA

You know my name! You came to my

school, right before you win the

title. Interviewed you for the

school paper. I was eleven.

ALI

You had a long braid...

BELINDA

Yeah! You called me little Indian

girl, then.

ALI

That was you?

BELINDA

I loved you then, like all those

kids. I never stopped. I still do.

66.

ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S VOICE (OVER)

(finishes)

ALI

You see the Ellis-Quarry fight?

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE

Yes... We'll be in front of the

U.S. Court of Appeals next month.

We'll lose. Then we appeal to the

Supreme Court.

ALI

Ellis the champ? Man. I beatin'

on him since we was sixteen. They

give Ellis to Joe Frazier?

Frazier'll kill him. Then they out

of juice. Where's the gate? So

they gotta let me fight. I fight

Ellis in a phone booth...middle of

Times Square...you think that draw

a crowd?

67.

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE

Draw a crowd or not draw a crowd,

Muhammad, is NOT going to make a

difference with your boxing

licenses. They don't want you to

fight.

(so much for speculation)

ACLU's handling your case against

the New York Boxing Commission.

They discovered New York's got

actual ex-murderers and ex-rapists

currently licensed to fight. But

revoked yours...?

ALI

Tijuana?

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE

No. State Department refused

permission for the one-hour visa.

No fight in Tijuana. Look...

ALI

Can't fight here. Can't fight

outside the country...

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE

I know people in the restaurant

business...want to start up a chain.

Muhammad Ali's "Champ

Burger"..."Muhammad Malts," "Fist

Full of Fries"...all of that.

ALI

Why I want to be in the restaurant

business?!

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE

'Cause you need the money.

ALI

How much all this gonna cost?

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE

Too much.    They do that to you, too,

you know.

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE (CONT'D)

Where you goin'?

68.

ALI

(to customers)

Look out!

CUSTOMER

Hey, champ!

ALI

Not then...

BELINDA

First time? 1961...Sister Khalilah

introduced you at assembly. You

said you would be heavyweight

champion of the world by the time

you were twenty-one!

ALI

I always tell the truth...

BELINDA

I was eleven. I interviewed you

for the student paper. You called

me "little Indian girl," 'cause I

wore my hair real long, in a

braid...I told you..."Man, you

scribble! You can't even write!

You ought to go back to school

until you do it better..."

69.

JIMI HENDRIX

(from "All Along the

Watchtower")

"There must be some kind of

way outta here,

said the joker to the thief..."

JIMI HENDRIX (CONT'D)

"There's too much confusion,

I can't get no relief.

Business men, they drink my wine,

plowmen dig my earth,

None of them along the line,

know what any of it is worth."

JIMI HENDRIX

"No reason to get excited,

the thief, he kindly spoke.

There are many here among us,

who feel that life is but a joke."

70.

JIMI HENDRIX

"But you and I, we've been

through that,

and this is not our fate.

So let us not talk falsely now,

the hour it's getting late..."

JIMI HENDRIX (CONT'D)

"All along the watchtower,

princes kept the view,

while all the women came and went,

barefoot servants, too."

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE

...struck out at the appellate

level in New Orleans. So we're

heading back to the Supreme Court...

INTERCUT WITH:

ALI

Thought we already got turned down

there.

71.

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE

I'm petitioning on a conscientious

objection basis. Religious belief.

We'll petition that your sincere

religious belief prohibits you from

shooting people. I believe they'll

hear that...

ALI

Where the money come from, Chauncey?

Herbert tell me I'm runnin' on

empty. Put aside "how do that

happen"? Licenses all revoked. No

passport. I can't fight here.

Can't fight abroad.

(beat)

And what happen if I lose the

Supreme Court?

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE

It's all over. You go to jail for

five years.

72.

JIMI HENDRIX

"Outside in the cold distance,

a wild cat did growl,

two riders were approaching,

and the wind began to HOWL!"

BINGHAM

Ellis doesn't belong in there.

ALI

(curt)

Man give him a shot, he took a shot.

BINGHAM

I saw Bundini in New York.

ALI

How's he?

BINGHAM

...bad shape. You better get your

belt b-b-back...

BELINDA (O.S.)

She's got to be done with that bottle.

BINGHAM

You call your parents, Ali?

BELINDA

No, he didn't. I told them about

the one on the way...myself.

(moves to the kitchen)

BINGHAM

You p-p-p-promised you'd call them.

73.

ALI

I'll call 'em, I'll call 'em...

(re: the baby)

May-may! It go in one end and come

out the other.

BELINDA

You wanna try changing her, for the

experience?

ALI

You so much better at it, mama.

ALI (CONT'D)

(to Maryum)

Maaan...Joe Frazier can't talk,

can't up the gate, can't fill the

arena. They gotta let me fight.

BELINDA

That happen, you promise me you put

some new people around you.

ALI

I need Angelo, Rudy, Ferdie --

BINGHAM

Ali, she's talkin' about "Brother"

Herbert.

BELINDA

Where are they when we need them?

You got Gene Kilroy droppin' off

groceries like charity. Borrowin'

money from my folks. So...?

HOWARD COSELL (V.O.)

What are your feelings about up-

and-coming Ken Norton?

74.

FRAZIER

(still sweating)

Norton's big and strong, but...

HOWARD COSELL

(interrupting)

Hold on one second...we have a

caller. Go ahead.

ALI (V.O.)

(into phone)

Cosell? This Muhammad Ali.

ALI (CONT'D)

Go to Georgia or Alabama or Sweden.

Everybody know I'm the champ. The

crown is a lie. I know it's a lie.

Joe Frazier know it's a lie. It

time for everybody to stop lying

and tell the truth.

HOWARD COSELL

Let's tell it like it is. With

your court and boxing problems,

Muhammad, can you get a fight promoted?

ALI

I ain't interested in the paycheck,

I'd fight Joe Frazier for free in a

phone booth in Times Square, if I

wasn't broke. I still will.

HOWARD COSELL

Did you say you were broke?   How

can you be broke?

75.

HOWARD COSELL

You've made more money than all

previous heavyweight champions

combined. What about your

management? Surely they have

provided for you...

ALI

I'm saying it's time for everybody

to quit lying! Muhammad Ali is the

champ! I have to, I'll get the

fight on myself.

(beat)

And if they offer me money, I ain't

gonna turn it down.

ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

Get me my son, Herbert, on the

telephone!

ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

Mr. Muhammad Ali desires to do that

which the Holy Qur'an teaches him

against. I am, therefore,

suspending Mr. Ali from the

practice of Islam. He may no

longer appear in temple, pray or

teach, or have any conversation

with any Muslim whatsoever.

Furthermore...he may no longer use

the name of Muhammad Ali.

Henceforward, he will revert to his

old slave name, Cassius Clay.

76.

BELINDA

Muhammad...?

ALI

You can't call me that no more.

BELINDA

Hell, I can't. I'm defying them by

talking to you. And being with you.

ALI

Whyn't you call an ambulance or a

doctor?

LANDLADY

(following behind)

Wouldn't let me. Said he knew

you...and to call you, Mr. Ali...

He's not been out for three days...

BINGHAM

Bundini!

BUNDINI

(opens his eyes; half

sits)

Watchu' doin' here? Gimme that

short dog!

77.

ALI

What's wrong with you, man?!

BUNDINI

Nothin' wrong with me!

BUNDINI (CONT'D)

What that?!!!

BINGHAM

A mystery...d-d-d-daylight...

BUNDINI

(shielding his eyes)

Leave me alone!

ALI

I leave you alone.   You called me!

BUNDINI

That were a week ago...

ALI

What you shame yourself like this

for, maaan...?! Why you shame

yourself?!

BUNDINI

Lemme alone!

(shouts)

I'm flyin'! The Sky Chief talk

through me. I know the word!

ALI

You know "low." You so low, the

curb look like up!

BUNDINI

(demonstrates)

Yeah? The king gotta go home to

his throne! From the root to the

fruit...!

78.

ALI

Those rhymes is old.    Forget 'em.

BUNDINI

(demonstrates more)

God don't care about you! Don't

care about me! In all of everything,

we mean nothin'. He don't know us.

We be. And that's the onliest

thing he did. And that's good

'cause that's why we free. But

free ain't easy. Free is real.

And realness is a motherfucker...

(low; almost spooky)

It eats raw meat.

(beat)

It walk in its own shoes.

(beat)

It does not waver...

(pause)

Yeah...

BUNDINI (CONT'D)

I sold your belt for five hundred

dollars to a barber on Lenox Avenue.

That's how low I did you. I'm

filled with weakness and got a

crazy mind. That belt say you the

Heavyweight Champion of the World.

Five hundred dollars and I put it

into my arm. That's what I called

to tell you...

BUNDINI (CONT'D)

...heard 'bout the Nation, all that

court stuff.

ALI

(absent)

Yeah.

BUNDINI

Forgive me, Muhammad.    Take me back...

ALI

No. There's no "back" to take you

to...

79.

ALI

(to himself)

...you can't do what you do best in

the world. And how you feed your

family? From prison? Who take

care of your kids? And is Allah,

is God with me?

ALI (O.S.)

A thousand dollars to the man who

brings me Howard Cosell's toupee!

Dead or alive!

80.

HOWARD COSELL

(loud)

Don't bother me. I'm a world-

famous broadcaster and you're an

ex-champion with diminished skills.

I can't be seen you, it would be

calamitous to my reputation.

ALI

Put me on, Howard.

HOWARD COSELL

Muhammad, I'd do anything for you.

But I got bosses who only give a

damn about Nielsen ratings.

ALI

I guarantee...it will be a

historical and momentous night!

ALI

...what Heavyweight Champion of the

World? I'm not the champ. I am

retired, finished, out of the game.

And I ain't gonna let myself grieve

and suffer none. But I know I will

not fight again...

HOWARD COSELL

I thought you were resolute in your

resolve to regain your crown...

ALI

If tomorrow they say: "We want you

to fight Joe Frazier. Madison

Square Garden. Millions and

millionses of dollars. Here's your

license back." I will tell them:

"I am sorry, but I am done."

HOWARD COSELL

What about Frazier?

81.

ALI

You'll have to wonder...what me and

Smokin' Joe would have looked like.

HOWARD COSELL

You surprise me, Muhammad...

ALI

Howard, you losing your hearing

along with your hair? Don't put

questions to it!

(beat)

I am through fighting. 'Cause I

got a bigger and more important

match comin' up. The U.S.

government. A heavier contender.

HOWARD COSELL

Do you think you're going to jail?

ALI

I don't know, but it's going to be

a shocking and terrible fight. In

fact, they might wish they let me

stay in boxing.

HOWARD COSELL

Joe Frazier told me on this show he

would knock you out.

ALI

There you go, agitatin'.

(beat)

You ask Smokin' Joe what he been

smokin'?! Joe Frazier even dream

he can whup me? He better wake up

and apologize...

(pause)

But, if I WAS to jump in the ring

with Joe, here's what you might

see...

(recites)

Ali comes out to meet Frazier,

but Frazier starts to retreat;

If Frazier goes back an inch farther,

he'll wind up in a ringside seat;

Ali swings with a left, Ali swings

with a right.

Frazier keeps backin', but there's

not enough room.

It a matter of time before Ali

lowers the boom;

Now Ali lands with a right, what

(MORE)

82.

ALI (CONT'D)

a beautiful swing,

But the punch lifts Frazier clean

out of the ring.

Frazier's still risin', but the

referee wears a frown,

'Cause he can't start countin' 'til

Frazier come down.

And Frazier's disappeared from

view. And the crowd is getting

frantic.

Then our radar stations pick

him up. He's somewhere over

the Atlantic.

Who would have thought when

they came to this fight,

That they would witness the

launching of a black satellite?

ALI (CONT'D)

But don't wait for they fight.

'Cause it ain't never gonna happen.

You only can wonder and imagine...

ALI (V.O.)

You want me to buy you a drink?

CASSIUS CLAY, SR.

I don't drink no more.

(squints at him)

You wanna fight?

ALI

I don't wanna fight no more.   Not

with you...

83.

ALI

Who dress you, Joe?   You look like

Dale Evans.

FRAZIER

Shut up.    Get in.

FRAZIER (CONT'D)

What the hell you in Philly for?

Philly my town.

ALI

To be closer to you, honey.

FRAZIER

Fuck you.

ALI

There be two undefeated heavyweight

champions! And they ain't fighting!

FRAZIER

I wanna fight you! Said it a

hundred times. The Man won't let

you fight no more. What you

complainin' to me for?

ALI

'Cause you gotta get behind this

and we gotta do this.

FRAZIER

We..."gotta" do nothin'!!!

ALI

You wanna get this on, Joe?     You

and me? Or not?!

FRAZIER

What about your license?

84.

ALI

I can fight in Atlanta.

FRAZIER

How's that? What about the Boxing

Commission?

ALI

Georgia ain't got no state boxing

commission. And Atlanta got a

black city council; a liberal

Jewish mayor, Sam something. It

all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta

with Jerry Quarry. But we got to

get the steamroller movin' now.

FRAZIER

What I got to do?

ALI

You announce that if I beat Quarry

you give me the title shot.

(puts it to him)

So what you say...maaan?

FRAZIER

My daddy was a sharecropper. I

worked in a slaughterhouse...right

on that corner. I came up from

nothing.

(raises fist)

What I got, I got with this. And I

already got the title. So I got

nothing to win and everything to lose.

ALI

But you know you ain't the champ yet.

FRAZIER

(looks at him)

Yeah..."yet."

(beat)

All right. You beat Quarry, I'll

get inna ring and fuck you up...

FRAZIER (CONT'D)

(quieter)

You need any money or anything to

tide you by...?

85.

ALI

(turns away)

I'm fine. Thanks.

ANGELO DUNDEE

TIME!!

ANGELO DUNDEE (CONT'D)

Weight's comin' down. 222.

ALI

What you want?

BUNDINI

Take me back, boss.

ALI

You want me to take you back?

BUNDINI

I'm clean.

(beat)

And you a resurrection. This is

God's act. Anybody love poor

people and little people and

fucked-up people gotta be a prophet.

(MORE)

86.

BUNDINI (CONT'D)

And the prophet is going home. You

the sun. Let me live in the light.

(pause)

Take me with, boss.

(beat)

...I'll do anything.

ALI

(quietly)

You can't hit what you can't see.

BUNDINI

(quietly)

Float like a butterfly, sting like

a bee.

ALI/BUNDINI

(quietly)

Rumble, young man, rumble!

87.

BUNDINI

You the man! You Superman! Ain't

no kryptonite in this ring tonight!

88.

BELINDA

(low)

...you don't need their management...

HERBERT

As-Saalam Alaikum...Brother Muhammad...

ALI

All praise to Allah...

(a beat, and

softly...)

...Alaikum Salaam...

HERBERT

(beaming)

The Messenger has lifted the

suspension, Muhammad. Congratulations.

ALI

You saying I can be a Muslim again,

Herbert?

HERBERT

Yes.

ALI

(cold)

I never stopped. Like I never

stopped being champ.

HERBERT

I begged my father to reinstate you.

ALI

When? After I promoted Quarry

fight? After I won it?

HERBERT

We can get you Frazier.

ALI

I already got Frazier.

HERBERT

We can get you five million dollars

for Frazier.

89.

ALI

Are we talking management, talking

money or talking religion?

HERBERT

When you...

ALI

(interrupts)

When I got leery and talked up how

come I'm broke, then came the

suspension. Now, you explain that

to me, my brother...?

HERBERT

It's my father...

ALI

(puts a hand on

his shoulder)

I love the Nation, Herbert. I love

Elijah Muhammad. But it don't own me.

ALI (CONT'D)

Now, you go on out. And you make

the Frazier deal.

HERBERT

My brother!

ALI

Yeah...

BINGHAM

You b-b-becoming a Christian?

Forgive and forget?

90.

INTERCUT WITH:

HOWARD COSELL

Muhammad, you T.K.O.'ed 'em...

ALI

What are you talking about, Howard?

Quarry?

HOWARD COSELL

(reads)

No. "The Supreme Court ruled today

in the case of the United States vs.

Cassius Clay, a.k.a. Muhammad

Ali..."

(looks up)

You won an 8-0 unanimous decision.

You're free.

ALI

I'm free.

ANGELO DUNDEE

What are you talking about?

ALI

Supreme Court set me free.

BUNDINI

That's 'cause they know the king is

gonna go home to his throne. And

they know everybody's with you, now.

And they wanna be on the RIGHT side!

91.

ANNOUNCER

Ladies and gentlemen, fifteen

rounds of boxing for the heavyweight

championship of the world...

ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

...the contender and former

heavyweight champion of the world,

seeking to regain his title, from

Louisville, Kentucky, Muhammad Ali!!!

ANNOUNCER

And in the opposite corner, the

current heavyweight champion of the

world, Smokin' Joe Frazier...!

DISSOLVE TO:

92.

ALI

(to himself)

Hook's comin'. Lean back, man!

Move back! WORK LEGS...!

93.

HOWARD COSELL (V.O.)

Ali was out! He was out on his

feet. Joe almost had him. Frazier

must have thought Ali was playing

possum. 'Cause Ali's a clown.

Others have come in on Ali when

he's playing possum and gotten

knocked out.

ANGELO DUNDEE

Hell of a fight, champ...

HANGERS-ON

They stole it from you! (etc.)

94.

ALI

Shut up! I lost.

(louder)

Get outta here...

RUDY

Go on!   Everybody out!

ANGELO DUNDEE

(to Pacheco)

Ferdie, take a look at this...

(to Ali)

It was still a hell of a fight.

ALI

Where's Belinda?

PACHECO

She fainted... They took her to

the aid station. She's okay.

ALI

My hands was in sand, Angie.     My

feet in water...

ANGELO DUNDEE

Maybe we shoulda had more time

between Blin and this, you

know...to get back into...

ALI

Woulda, shoulda, coulda...

(pause)

After three-and-a-half years,

this...from how far back...comeback is.

95.

PRESS

Were you robbed?

ALI

I lost. You lose, you don't shoot

yourself. The world goes on.

ANOTHER REPORTER

Joe said he didn't think you wanted

to fight him again...

ALI

(stops)

Oh, how wrong he is.

BELINDA

My God.    They killed you!

PACHECO

Get away from her.     What is that?

ALI

I ain't dead, baby!     C'mon.

96.

ALI

I can move my jaw with my tongue.

He got me...

PACHECO

(concerned)

It's broke. I think...I think your

jaw's broke.

ALI

Ain't stoppin' nothin'...!

(glares at them)

Nothin' stoppin'...!

BURN OUT TO WHITE:

97.

HERBERT

Now that Smokin' Joe's run out of

tomato cans to beat up, I finally

got Yank to commit to a rematch

with you in about six months.

Frazier said he'd be happy with

three mil...

(beat)

HERBERT (CONT'D)

I'll fly to Jamaica and get Yank to

sign right after Joe beats this big

stiff.

(to TV)

ALI

(through still-wired-

together jaw)

Foreman call me one time after he

won the Olympics...

98.

HOWARD COSELL

(shouting)

DOWN GOES FRAZIER! DOWN GOES FRAZIER!

BINGHAM

(wry)

B-b-be easy gettin' a Frazier fight

now. He ain't the champ of

anything except getting knocked down.

ALI

So.

99.

ANGELO DUNDEE

So we only eked this one out. And

George Foreman makes Frazier look

like a sissy.

PACHECO

You see their fight?

HOWARD BINGHAM

You mean the Joe Frazier falling-

down lesson?

PACHECO

And Foreman is 24. You are 32

years old. I don't want to see

your head get turned into someone's

bull's-eye.

ANGELO DUNDEE

...but, you go? We're the corner,

same as always. But it ain't gonna

be easy.

ALI

(to Angelo)

You think I still got the tools?

ANGELO DUNDEE

You got the tools, Daddy.     But they

different.

ALI

(thinks; decides:

go)

Well, you better sharpen 'em up.

'Cause we goin' to Africa.

BUNDINI

The motherland. From the root to

the fruit. We gonna rumble...in

the jungle.

ALI

It's time to be heavyweight

champion of the world again.

BUNDINI

Yeah, man!

DON KING

"Rumble in the Jungle!"     That's the

name I given it.

100.

DON KING (CONT'D)

A historical happening. This event

will show that the black man has

arrived on the world stage.

Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in

Kinshasa, Zaire.

REPORTERS

Don. Zaire? Why not Antarctica?

What's wrong with New York City?

DON KING

Because you miss the significance.

I dream, as Martin Luther King once

dreamt, that a man could be judged

by the content of his mind. This

is about black men helping black

men, overcoming four hundred years

of racial depression to the dawn of

a new day of liberation...financial

and otherwise.

DON KING (CONT'D)

It will raise up the spirit of our

inner cities. It will rise up and

fill with hope the souls, the

unrequited needs of the black

proletariat, that is, the

discouraged, dispirited, denigrated,

denizens of the demimonde, that is

called...the ghetto.

ALI

Man, you crazy.

101.

DON KING

Ten million dollars. With one

stroke of the pen, you split the

world's biggest emolumation of the

history of sports!

DON KING (CONT'D)

The "Rumble in the Jungle"!

102.

ALI

(to Zairian Official;

shouts)

What are they saying, man?!!!    Why

they saying that?

ZAIRIAN OFFICIAL #1

They say, "Ali, boma ye. Ali, boma

ye."

ALI

What's that mean?!   I don't understand!

ZAIRIAN OFFICIAL #1

It mean...!

ALI

(can't hear)

What?!

ZAIRIAN OFFICIAL #1

(has to shout)

It mean..."Ali, kill him! Ali,

kill him!"

ALI

Ali, boma ye!

ALI (CONT'D)

Ali, boma ye!

103.

104.

ALI

(to himself)

Fast. Six left jabs flash from his

chest and shoulder, followed by a

right hook and left and right

uppercuts.

ALI (CONT'D)

(to himself)

Back up, maaan...

(weaves suddenly;

another voice)

...you fast!

KIDS

Ali, boma ye!

ALI

(repeating)

Ali, boma ye George Foreman!

ALI (CONT'D)

You out, sucker!

105.

TEENAGER

(broken English)

You beat them, Ali!

ALI

Foreman?   I kill him!

106.

ALI (CONT'D)

Shazaam!!!

ALI

(to himself)

...even if I die here. If it kill

me, no matter what...I gotta win.

CUT TO:

ALI

Howard! How many you ugly

sportswriters in there got me over

Foreman? Don't lie.

HOWARD COSELL

(beat)

Some of us...Norman, me...are

worried. How you gonna dance

against George?? He's sparring

with a middleweight, training to

cut you off. He gets you against

the ropes, he can knock you out

with either hand.

ALI

(drops facade)

What's the odds?

107.

HOWARD COSELL

Two-and-a-half-to-one. Against.

We're worried you're going to get hurt.

ALI

This'll be the biggest upset since

Sonny Liston. I want all of you to

write it down! This fight is no

contest!

ALI (CONT'D)

George Foreman is a big mummy.

I've officially named him "The Mummy."

ALI (CONT'D)

George punches are like "Look out,

here come the left." Whomp!

(stiff-armed swing)

Here come the right! Whomp! Like

a Mummy. But "The Mummy" can't hit

what it can't see. I'm fast!

Gonna dance. Be all over George.

George is gonna feel he surrounded.

(beat)

And I done somethin' new for this

fight; I done rassled with an

alligator.

ALI (CONT'D)

That's right!

(laughter again;

Ali almost loses it)

I have rassled with an alligator.

I done tussled with a whale. I

done handcuffed lightning, thrown

thunder in jail. That's bad! Only

last week I murdered a rock.

Injured a stone. Hospitalized a

brick. I'm so mean, I make

medicine sick.

108.

HOWARD COSELL

Muhammad, I'm sorry. I have to ask.

(he hesitates; he's

sorry, but)

Are you really fast enough, anymore?

To beat George Foreman? Many

people believe you don't have the

same skills, that you are not the

same man you used to be ten years ago.

ALI

Howard. I didn't want to talk

about this, especially in front of

everybody. But I talked to your

wife! And she told me you're not

the man you used to be...two years ago!

109.

CUT TO:

ALI

Salaam Alaikum, brothers!

(raises one arm)

The champ is here!

BELINDA

Here's your water.

ALI

Bottled water. Frozen steaks.

Brought all this stuff like

Africans don't have steaks...

BELINDA

You could pick up parasites...

110.

ALI

BELINDA

ALI

BELINDA

ALI

(pause)

BELINDA

(she doesn't get it)

ALI

BELINDA

(on a roll)

ALI

BELINDA

(running on)

ALI

111.

BELINDA

Don King talks black, lives white

and thinks green! Why you

defending him and "brother" Herbert?

(against me)

ALI

'Cause clean-cut Muslims parading

on the South Side of Chicago don't

get this done! I got to put

honkeys with connections and bad-

ass niggers to it, too.

BELINDA

(not hearing)

And now they got you up against

George Foreman. Do they give a

damn you could get killed?

ALI

That what this is? Think I gonna

lose? Puttin' doubt on me?

BELINDA

(tears flow)

I think: why is my Muslim husband

letting himself get strung up on a

cross...? It means, "tell me."

BELINDA (CONT'D)

Maryum is sick. Maybe I oughta go

back to Chicago and look after her.

ALI

Sure.

BELINDA

I'll be back before the fight.

(sarcastic)

If that's all right, my husband...

CUT TO:

112.

CUT TO:

DON KING

(over the drumming)

Champ! Champ! George had an accident.

ANGELO DUNDEE

(suspicious)

What are you talking about?

DON KING

Got cut. Right above his right eye.

His sparring partner's elbow.

Split it open, so...

ANGELO DUNDEE

Can he fight?

DON KING

Not for six weeks.

DON KING (CONT'D)

This is not a humorous situation,

my champion. This postponement

could be long, especially if George

leaves.

113.

ANGELO DUNDEE

Are you tryin' to pull something,

Don? Ali wants his title. And he

wants it back in Zaire. George

leaves, he ain't comin' back.

George don't like it here.

DON KING

How right you are, my suspicious

and short Italian brother. And my

fiduciary responsibility to this

first all-black promotion is like a

garden in the African sun. It must

grow! It must bloom! It cannot

flower in the gloom and shade of

postponement to some dome. Like

the Astrodome, the Super-dome, any

dome outta Zaire, where it be

deprived of light and bled of water.

'Cause what gonna bleed...is money.

A hemorrhage of cash.

(sees it all)

...blood on the floor. Double

hotel costs. Double travel costs.

Airplanes. Food and beverage...

ANGELO DUNDEE

(rhetorical)

What do you expect us to do, Don?

DON KING

(moves close to Ali)

Muhammad. Find a way to get George

to stay. Be Moses in reverse: do

NOT let my people go! Stay the

fuck right here, in Egypt, if

you'll pardon my Swahili.

BINGHAM

L-l-l-lingala.

DON KING

What?

BINGHAM

Lingala.   They s-s-s-speak Lingala.

DON KING

Who cares?

114.

ANGELO DUNDEE

(pissed, dissed big)

If George goes? You forfeit five

million. You crawl back to

Cincinnati. You ain't promotin' a

charity raffle...

DON KING

(irrepressible)

If George goes? George goes, my

champion, I will get you Joe

Frazier. Ali-Frazier III...the

fight everybody want to see.

ALI

(interrupts)

Truth is...George knocked hisself out.

ALI (CONT'D)

That's right. He did three rounds.

Knew he was gonna lose to Muhammad

Ali and knocked hisself out. And I

predict that whenever the fight is

set, he might not show up!

DON KING

(double entendre)

You bad!

ALI

I'm a bad man!

DON KING

Ain't no doubt about it.

ALI

And you tell the same thing to George.

ALI (CONT'D)

(to King)

I been watchin' you! I heard you.

I know he's your man. I know you

got him picked. But the man's in

trouble.

(MORE)

115.

ALI (CONT'D)

The whole world was gonna know.

But, now, he ain't gonna show.

That's why he knocked hisself out

when he was training.

DON KING

(laughs to dismiss

Ali)

We will reschedule the fight, and

to ensure George is ready, we are

thinking of postponing from

September 24th to October 30th.

REPORTER

What about the concert, Don?

DON KING

That would go off as planned on

September 22nd and 23rd.

ALI

(skeptical)

Uh-huh. I want all helicopters

guarded! Private boats. Private

jets. I want the airport -- I'm

serious -- I want President Mobutu

and all his paratroopers. Mobutu

and all his paratroopers. I want

all of you "Zaireans" to be on

guard! Watch all strange boats

tryin' to slip away! They might be

takin' him out.

ANGELO DUNDEE

The bus station.

ALI

Yeah. Watch the bus station.

Watch everything! Elephant

caravans. He might sneak out by

elephant.

ANGELO DUNDEE

What you say?

DON KING

I ain't talkin' to you!

116.

ALI

(to King)

Hey!!!

ALI (CONT'D)

Don't talk to Angelo like that!

Don't you talk to him like that

ever again!!!

ALI (CONT'D)

You think you're callin' these

shots, Don? You're not.

ALI (CONT'D)

(to King)

They know!

(segues into a

routine)

All those ladies out there know.

ALI (CONT'D)

(mock demagoguery)

They know I'm ready! I see fear in

the eyes of his followers! I see

fear! This is the fight that

Muhammad Ali was supposed to be

ended. The myth of Muhammad was

supposed to fall!

(hits the table with

his fist; glares at

King)

Supposed to be my destruction!

(French voices and

laughter, understated)

They miscalculated. They misjudged.

They got it...wrong.

117.

ALI (V.O.)

Say, girl...!

ALI (CONT'D)

C'mere.   I know you?

VERONICA

I don't think so.

ALI

What's your name?

VERONICA

Veronica Porche.

ALI

Like the sports car.

VERONICA

(laughs)

Yes.

ALI

But with a little something extra.

(beat)

Veronica, I know you now. C'mere,

sit down.

ALI (CONT'D)

You with Don?

118.

VERONICA

Don brought me here, but I'm not

"with"...anybody.

ALI

Where you from?

VERONICA

L.A. But my people are from

Louisiana. We're Creole. So I'm

African, French, Spanish, my

mother's grandfather was Jewish.

ALI

(looking at her

admiringly)

Well...they all came together real

nice.

VERONICA

You know...

(hesitating; low)

...I'm glad you said what you did.

You made sure this fight stays here.

ALI

All them writers in there think

Foreman gonna...kill me!

(eyes go wide)

What you think?

VERONICA

Ali, boma ye.

119.

PLIMPTON TYPE

...she's an African "succubus."

Means witch doctor.

BUNDINI

Succubus? Suck my dick. They

ain't room in Africa for more than

one witch doctor. And that's B'dini.

ALI

You been to Hong Kong?   Taiwan?

Thailand?

VERONICA

No.

ALI

I can't go there. All the ladies

out there from Indonesia, Japan,

Hawaii, India...

(high-pitched voice,

imitating female fans)

"Ali-i-i-e-e-e! Ali-e-e-e! Oh,

Muhammad Al-i-i-i!"

(speaks in faux foreign

language, imitating

female fans; to Bingham)

You seen those people from Thailand?

I was in Bangkok -- I couldn't walk.

(laughter; hangs his

head)

I couldn't...I just couldn't do

nothin'. "Get me outta this

country!"

(laughter)

The women were so pretty...

BINGHAM

'B-b-b-bout Hong Kong, man?!   You

know what I heard?

ALI

(interrupts)

Ladies in Thailand, their hair

comes down to their knees...and

they about Veronica's

complexion...and they bad!

(MORE)

120.

ALI (CONT'D)

But they ain't nothin' like the

"sisters."

(holds Veronica's

hands, looks deep

into her eyes)

Ain't NOTHIN' like the sisters!

NEWS CAMERAMAN

Champ...

ALI

(to Veronica)

Let's go for a ride.

ALI

So why you glad we still here?

121.

VERONICA

Holdin' this in Africa make people

proud. All over the world.

They're proud of you. Anybody can

fight in Vegas.

ALI

That's one job.    I got two...

ALI (CONT'D)

(melodramatic)

...gotta whup George!

VERONICA

Islamic faith help you to that?

ALI

Listen, girl, as a Muslim, I am

busted out and failed in the eyes

of God. I shoulda discovered Islam

at 50! 'Cause I am weak on women.

They take my eyes and my heart

follow...causing me to be a lovin'

husband and a terrible husband...!

(looks down at her,

intensely)

...green eyes and cocoa skin...?

(feigns wobbly legs)

...okay, rest of me, let's go!!

ALI

(to himself)

Faster! Faster!

DUNDEE

(shouts)

TIME!

122.

HOLMES

You can't lead a right hand.   Not

at him!

ALI

Why not?

HOLMES

Too long...to get it there. Man, I

mean, to think you could hit him

with a right lead...it's insulting...

Nobody would lead a right...

BUNDINI

I got him! Lock him up.

SADLER

(laughs)

Hey, hold up, chump!   Make this

chump turn me loose.

SADLER (CONT'D)

This is my wife, Irene...

123.

ALI

Hey! Look! Look at George

Foreman's trainer, feelin' me up on

purpose! On the side, to see if

I'm in shape!

IRENE

Can I have your autograph?

ALI

We'll, you ain't gonna find no fat!

Watch out!!

SADLER

(lunges for wife's

note pad)

Give me that thing!

BINGHAM

(breaking through)

Muhammad. Give her an Ali button!

SADLER

No, you ain't.

(concedes)

All right, give my wife an Ali button.

ALI

She's gotta put it on.

SADLER

Give my wife one.

BINGHAM

Bo'dini, you got Ali buttons?

ALI

"George" buttons is all I got. In

my bedroom! All over the bed!

Everywhere! To remind me...of all

of ya'. All of ya'! Reminds me of

all ya'!

ORTF INTERVIEWER

(English translation)

Excuse me. You are from the U.S.

Embassy? Do you have a prediction?

BRADLEY

(in French)

(caught; smiles)

Je suis avec l'Agence americane

d'informations. Il ne m'est pas

permis d'exprimer mes preferences

entre deux citoyens des Etats-Unis.

BRADLEY

(English translation)

(caught; smiles)

I'm with the U.S. Information

Agency. I'm not allowed to take

favorites among two United States

citizens...

ANGELO DUNDEE

(meaning Sadler)

He gone?

ALI

Yeah.

125.

BELINDA

Hello, Muhammad. Bingham.    Mr. Cosell.

HOWARD COSELL

(tight)

Hi...Mrs. Ali.

ALI

When did you get in?

BELINDA

Just now. Muhammad, may I have a

word with you, please?

BELINDA

What is going on?

ALI

You know what's going on.

(it's not the

first time)

BELINDA

But I don't have to have it thrown

in my face. I don't have to read

about it and have people call me up

on the phone about it...

ALI

I didn't mean for it to come out...

BELINDA

Oh, hell, Muhammad, you got no

discretion. You never did. You

humiliate me!

BELINDA (CONT'D)

I clean for you. I cook for you.

I feel every punch you take.

126.

ALI

I know that.

BELINDA

Then why you got to be visible with

women?

ALI

I didn't mean for it to be...

BELINDA

I live with the casual ones.

(gestures to Veronica's

clothing)

But this, this...I can't hold it

together anymore.

ALI

I don't want to hurt you. It's

wrong. You're a good wife to me.

BELINDA

Then why do you disrespect me this

way?!

ALI

I respect you.   I always respect you.

BELINDA

Do you love her?

BELINDA (CONT'D)

Do you want to marry her?

ALI

I follow my heart.

BELINDA

"You're following your heart"?

(sarcasm falls away)

That's what you do. No matter what

anybody says. Or thinks. Or what

it does...

(pause)

And what happens now?

ALI

I fight George.

(after a beat)

I didn't come this far to quit.

127.

BELINDA

Neither of us did.

BINGHAM

Belinda?

BINGHAM (CONT'D)

You can't beat him. You can't beat

him, 'cause you can't not love him.

ALI

eyeballing George)

You never should have come to Africa.

hook lands)

BUNDINI

DUNDEE

Get off the ropes!   What are you

there for you.

141.

ALI (CONT'D)

(talking to George in

his head)

Want the title...wear the

heavyweight crown?

(to himself)

Jaw broke? Nose smashed? Face

busted? You ready to die? Is that

you?

(towards George)

'Cause you gonna meet a man who

will die before he let you win.
