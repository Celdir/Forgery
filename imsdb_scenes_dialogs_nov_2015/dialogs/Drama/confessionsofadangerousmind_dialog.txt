a screenplay by

Charlie Kaufman

based on

CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND

an unauthorized biography by

Chuck Barris

third draft (revised)

May 5, 1998

This film is a reenactment of actual

events. It is based on Mr. Barris's

private journals, public records, and

hundreds of hours of taped interviews.

PERFORMER

Why'd they do that? I wasn't done.

BARRIS (AGE 50)

I don't understand. Juice, why'd you

gong this nice man?

JAYE P. MORGAN

Not to be.     That is the answer.

2.

BARRIS

We'll be right back with more stuff.

BARRIS

(mumbly)

Fuck. Shit. Piss.

(CONTINUED)

3.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

(weakly)

More stuff?

BELLHOP

Yes sir, Mr. Barris. Everything you

requested. Except I couldn't find a...

(consults list)

... DH-10 directional fragmentation mine.

BARRIS

Well, it's late.

(mumbling and bowing)

But thank you. Thank you for trying.

You are a scholar and a...

BARRIS (CONT'D)

Keep it. It's okay. Keep it.    You are a

scholar and a...

BELLHOP

(eyes averted)

Thank you, sir.

BARRIS

Why are you not looking at me like that?

Do I look ugly to you?

(runs to the mirror)

It's the not sleeping. I'm not sleeping,

see. I have a lot on my...

BELLHOP

(re: exploded tv)

Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir?

(CONTINUED)

4.

BARRIS

(conspiratorially)

You know what I'd do? -- And don't tell

anybody -- I'd rub... I'd rub Alpo brand

dog food on my dick so the dogs would

stick their noses into my... dick.

Guaranteed big laugh, right? That was my

trick, my great contribution to the

world. How wouldn't I degrade myself, I

ask you.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

(screaming)

I ask you!

BELLHOP

I... I... I don't know, sir.

BELLHOP (CONT'D)

Mr. Barris, maybe if you just don't watch

the show every night, you wouldn't have

to --

BARRIS

I always pay for the damn tv's, don't I?

(turning to face him)

Don't I?!

BELLHOP

It's -- Yes, you do, sir, and we

appreciate that -- It's just that

there've been complaints from some of the

other guests, and Mr. Andrews, the

assistant manager, requested that I --

BARRIS

Still? Complaints? I specifically used

the silencer this time! Specifically!

BELLHOP

Well, the people in 917 found a bullet

lodged in their wall. And while we want

to accommodate you -- we certainly value

your patronage -- there is an issue of

customer safety.

(CONTINUED)

5.

BARRIS

Yes, of course.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

My apologies. Buy -- 917, is it? -- buy

them a magnum of your finest champagne.

And... and your finest spackle. Oh, and

get me a bag of plastic army men while

you're out. I forgot to tell you before.

BELLHOP

Thank you for your understanding, sir.

BARRIS

(calling after)

And some black socks!   Seven black socks,

you rascule!

BARRIS (CONT'D)

Bellhop Johnson was clearly repulsed by

the sight of me. And why not? I'm

wrinkled...

(searches for simile, then

proudly)

... like a prune. Covered in liver

spots...

(searches for simile)

... like an old guy. My hair is falling

out in clumps, leaving exposed patches of

white, sickly scalp. A flabby inner-tube

of fat hangs from my waist, practically

obscuring my bedraggled prick -- dark and

shriveled and dead. Still leaking urine

even though I left the toilet ages ago.

My asshole itches. Hemorrhoids abound.

George Orwell said every man has the face

he deserves by fifty. Does every man

have the asshole he deserves by fifty, as

well? Does every fifty year old asshole

have the asshole he deserves?

6.

ACTUAL BARRIS

It was 1981. I had holed myself up in

this New York hotel. Parker Hotel.

Terrified of everything. Ashamed of my

life.

INTERVIEWER (O.C.)

Ashamed?   What do you mean?

ACTUAL BARRIS

When you're young, your potential is

infinite. You might do anything, really.

You might be great. You might be

Einstein. You might be Goethe. Then you

get to an age where what you might be

gives way to what you have been. You

weren't Einstein. You weren't anything.

That's a bad moment. But I remembered

something Carlyle wrote: "... there is no

life of a man, faithfully recorded, but

is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or

unrhymed." I realized my salvation might

be in recording my wasted life,

unflinchingly. Maybe it would serve as a

cautionary tale. Maybe it would help me

understand why.

BARRIS (V.O.)

My name is Charles Prescott Barris. I

have written pop songs, I have been a

television producer. I am responsible

for polluting the airwaves with mind-

numbing, puerile entertainment. In

addition, I have murdered thirty-three

human beings. I am damned to hell.

DISSOLVE TO:

7.

BARRIS (V.O.)

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in

1931, my early childhood remains

accessible to me only as a series of

elliptical, enigmatic memories.

BARRIS (V.O.)

The taste of bologna fresh from the

butcher.

BARRIS (V.O.)

The sickly sweet smell of a burning

babydoll on a crisp autumn day.

BARRIS (V.O.)

Velvet brushing against my tender young

skin, as my mother dressed me.

BARRIS (V.O.)

A constant, inarticulate rage leading to

fist fight after fist fight.

(CONTINUED)

8.

BARRIS (V.O.)

The calm I felt watching dust suspended

in the early morning sunlight.

BARRIS (V.O.)

I remember fear.

BARRIS (V.O.)

Love.

MOTHER

You like the way mommy looks, Chuckie?

BARRIS (AGE 4)

Yes.

MOTHER

I bet you would like to be a mommy some

day, wouldn't you?

BARRIS

Yes, mommy. Please.

MOTHER

C'mere, you.

BARRIS (V.O.)

Rejection.

(CONTINUED)

9.

BARRIS (V.O.)

Expulsion.

DISSOLVE TO:

BARRIS (V.O.)

When I was sixteen I had an experience

with my little sister's friend Tuvia that

left an indelible impression.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

Phoebe's no Walter Page, huh, Tuvia?

TUVIA

I don't know who that is.

BARRIS

Of course you don't.

(beat)

Why are you waiting around anyway,

listening to this cacophonous cacophony,

when you could be in your own abode

disrupting the lives of your own

siblings?

TUVIA

I don't know what anything you say means.

BARRIS

No.    You wouldn't, would you.

(CONTINUED)

10.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

Hey.

TUVIA

(not looking)

What?

BARRIS

Hey, Tuvia.

TUVIA

(turning)

Wha-at?!

BARRIS

You wanna lick it?

TUVIA

No.    Why should I?

BARRIS

Well, for one thing it tastes like

strawberry. My sister tells me you love

strawberries.

TUVIA

Yeah, well... I hate strawberries.

BARRIS

Honestly, a man's penis tastes exactly

like a strawberry lollipop.

TUVIA

Look, I know that's not true, so --

BARRIS

It is true. It's weird but it's true.    I

just read a research paper on it.

11.

BARRIS

(sadly wistful)

My first love.

TUVIA

Uchh. Yech. It doesn't taste anything

like strawberry, you creep.

BARRIS

(curious)

Well, what does it taste like?

TUVIA

Y'know, I'm gonna tell your mother what

you just did.

BARRIS

If you do, I'll tell your mother you made

our dog lick your crack.

TUVIA

I did not!

BARRIS

(shrugging)

So what?

BARRIS (V.O.)

Perhaps my whole life turned at that

point. The repulsiveness of my sex

confirmed by the tastebuds of a ripening

pubescent girl.

12.

BARRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And so I found myself in a downward

spiral of debauchery. Endlessly chasing

pussy. My only focus in life: to get

laid, to get blown, trying to fool myself

into believing that given the right

combination of circumstances and

deception, maybe the Tuvias of the world

could desire me the way I desired them.

I only wanted to be loved.

BARRIS (V.O.)

A constant, inarticulate rage led to bar

fight after bar fight.

BARRIS (V.O.)

As much as I tried, I couldn't understand

my past and my present was miserable, so,

at twenty-four, I decided what I needed

was a future...

13.

BARRIS (V.O.)

... I had heard that television was an

industry with a future.

BARRIS

Next, we'll have a look at the studio

where they produce the Today Show.

GIRLFRIEND

That fella Raymond in payroll is kinda

cute, huh?

GEORGIA

Cute's all well and good, Mary Ann, but

what you want is a man who's goin'

places. A go-getter on the management

fast-track.

BARRIS

Management trainee application, please.

(CONTINUED)

14.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

How many people applying for this so far?

CLERK

(calculating)

Let's see, including you... about two

thousand.

BARRIS

For how many positions?

CLERK

(looking up and smiling)

Five.

GEORGIA

Tell me again.

BARRIS

Head of network sales at thirty.   Head of

the entire network at forty.

GEORGIA

And?

BARRIS

(rote)

Dead of a heart attack by fifty with all

my millions left to you.

GEORGIA

You're wonderful. I love you, Mr. Chuck

Barris, management trainee.

BARRIS (V.O.)

Life was sweet. For a minute.

15.

GEORGIA

Baby doll!

BARRIS

I got fired.

GEORGIA

Fired?

BARRIS

Fired.   F-I-R...

GEORGIA

Fired?   What the fuck did you get fired

for?!

BARRIS

I don't know, efficiency cutback. Some

bullshit... Look, it's gonna be...

GEORGIA

Well, I'm pregnant, you fuck!

BARRIS

Pregnant?

GEORGIA

Yeah, pregnant!

BARRIS

What the fuck did you get pregnant for?!

GEORGIA

What do you mean, what the fuck did I get

pregnant for? You got me fucking

pregnant, you fuck!

BARRIS

Well, fuck you.

(CONTINUED)

16.

BARRIS

So I figured I'd skip town. I intend to

be important, y'know, I can't be saddled

with this.. But then I remembered

something Carlyle said: "Do the duty

which lies nearest thee."

BAR FLY

Who's Carlyle?

BARRIS

Dear God, why do I even bother?

BAR FLY

Hey, fuck you, you condescending prick.

BARRIS

Hey, fuck you.

BAR FLY

Hey, fuck you.

BARRIS

Hey, fuck you.

GEORGIA

(pissy)

Looks like I was just late.

ACTUAL GEORGIA

I woke up and he was gone. No note. No

nothing. I never saw him again. Until

that stupid tv show he did.

(CONTINUED)

17.

JEWISH-LOOKING MAN

The Gong Show.

ACTUAL GEORGIA

I know what it's called, jerk.

BARRIS (V.O.)

In '61 I was thirty. I had become a

minor suit at ABC. It was during the

music payola scandal...

BARRIS (V.O.)

...so my job was to commute to Philly

every day to the American Bandstand

tapings, and keep an eye on Dick Clark.

DICK CLARK

Chuck Barris? He spooked me. I tried to

keep on his good side becuase he was sort

of... spooky.

INTERVIEWER (O.C.)

How so?

DICK CLARK

I dunno, there was something in his eyes.

Something dark, like unbridled ambition,

maybe. Or an inarticulate rage.

(CONTINUED)

18.

BARRIS (V.O.)

On weekends I used to hang around

amusement parks. Because that's where

the young girls were.

BARRIS (V.O.)

I wrote a song about my experience.

FREDDIE CANNON

Last night I took a walk after dark/to

see a place called Palisades Park/to have

some fun and see what I could see/that's

where the girls are

DISSOLVE TO:

BARRIS (V.O.)

I got it to Freddie "Boom Boom" Cannon

through my friendship with Dick Clark.

Dick really wanted to help me out.

FREDDIE CANNON

I took a ride on the shoop de shoop/that

girl I sat beside was awful cute/and when

we stopped she was holding hands with

me/my heart was flying/up like a rocket

ship/down like a roller coaster/fast like

a loop de loop/round like a merry go

'round...

BARRIS

Hi.

DEBBIE

What?

(CONTINUED)

19.

BARRIS

Hi!

DEBBIE

Oh.

BARRIS

I wrote this song.

DEBBIE

Oh.    Uh-huh.

BARRIS

It's number three on the pop charts.

DEBBIE

Huh.

BARRIS

See, I believe there's a great future in

television.

DEBBIE

Uh-huh.

BARRIS

So I'm going to take my royalties and

create a pilot. A pilot is what they

call a test tv show.

DEBBIE

I work in tv.

BARRIS

Yeah. It's gonna be a game show. I

believe there's a great future in game

shows.

DEBBIE

That's good.

BARRIS

Everyone loves game shows, right?

DEBBIE

I don't know.

(CONTINUED)

20.

BARRIS

Well, they do.

DEBBIE

That's great then.

BARRIS

I'm on my way!

PENNY

Hello.

BARRIS

Hi.   Don't be alarmed    I'm with Debbie.

PENNY

Yeah, I figured.

PENNY (CONT'D)

You hungry?

BARRIS

Um, no thanks.

PENNY

Thirsty?

BARRIS

If you have a beer.

(CONTINUED)

21.

PENNY

So how was sex with Debbie?   I've always

wondered.

BARRIS

(a little taken aback)

It was good. Fine. Thanks for asking.

PENNY

No problem. I just got fucked by this

drummer cat. A really righteous Negro

hipster.

BARRIS

Huh.   Interesting.

PENNY

See, I believe in the brotherhood of man.

Last week I got fucked by an Oriental.

(beat, studies him)

What are you?

BARRIS

Jew.

PENNY

That's what I thought. I had a Jew, but

he was Sephardic. You look Ashkenazi

(pronounced Ashkuh-Natzee), I'm guessing.

BARRIS

Ashkenazi.

PENNY

Right. Ashkenazi... I haven't balled one

of them.

BARRIS

You're a romantic.

PENNY

Eh, I just don't get into all the

bullshit between cats and chicks.

BARRIS

I know what you mean.

PENNY

(not hearing him)

You know what I mean?

BARRIS

I know what you mean.

(CONTINUED)

22.

PENNY

Besides, you fall in love with a cat, you

only get hurt. Right?

BARRIS

Don't I know it.

PENNY

(beat)

We could ball if you want.     I seem to

like you pretty well.

BARRIS

Well, that would be good. But, you know,

I'm kind of here with Debbie. It doesn't

seem right.

PENNY

Yeah. That's true. I didn't think of

that.

(getting up)

Well, I'm going to bed. Nice meeting

you.

BARRIS

What's your name?

PENNY

Penny.

BARRIS

I'm Chuck.

PENNY

Oh, you're the one who wrote that

Palisades song. I love that song.     It's

such sentimental bullshit.

(CONTINUED)

23.

PENNY

(animatedly)

... so this ape and I were looking at

each other. It was, like, across time

and evolution. Then he began to talk,

but it was a language I didn't

understand, maybe Swiss. Then he turned

into Perry Como, real square and...

what's wrong with you?

BARRIS

Nothing.

PENNY

Just because we fucked, doesn't mean

there are strings now. It's okay.

BARRIS

Okay.

PENNY

Okay? I only wanted to tell you my dream

is all. Nothing more complicated than

that. Don't panic.

BARRIS

I'm just used to all this dating

bullshit, y'know. Now we're a couple.

Now I'm obliged to give a shit what you

say.

PENNY

Don't worry about it, I'm not into those

games either. So, anyway, this monkey

turns into Perry Como and I say --

BARRIS

Holy fuck!

PENNY

What?

BARRIS

Holy holy fuck!

(runs over, kisses her)

You just gave me an idea.

(starts pacing

For a show! Fuck!

PENNY

A show about monkeys?

(CONTINUED)

24.

BARRIS

In a way. About the craziest monkey of

all: Monkius Humanius! Don't you see?

About people! About sex. About romance.

About the bullshit of dating!

BARRIS

I call it The Dating Game, Mr. Goldberg.

And that's what it's about. A pretty

girl asks three handsome guys, who she

can't see, silly questions. And based on

their answers, she picks one to date.

And we pay for the date. That's it!

That's the show! It's got everything!

PENNY

No?

BARRIS

(lighting up)

They bought it!

BARRIS (CONT'D)

They bought it they bought it they bought

it...

BARRIS (CONT'D)

They're giving me seventy-five hundred

fucking dollars to make a pilot!

PENNY

Oh my God!     Oh my God! We gotta go

celebrate!     Let's go roller skating!

(CONTINUED)

25.

BARRIS

I can't, Pen. I got a date.

PENNY

Okay.     That's cool.    Call me after.

BARRIS

Yeha, okay. I will.

ACTUAL BARRIS (V.O.)

I figured I was in. All I had to do was

get the pilot made and I'd be a

millionaire. Everyone would love me.

ACTUAL BARRIS

(staring off)

Was anyone ever so young?

PHOEBE

Chuck...

BARRIS

Albert's dead.

PHOEBE

Well, he led an amazingly long life.

BARRIS

Still, it's hard to go on.

(CONTINUED)

26.

PHOEBE

Y'know, you've been staring out this

window for six months now.

BARRIS

I'm trying to come up with new tv shows,

if you must know. Okay? That's what I'm

doing. I believe there's a real future

in tv.

(holds up notebook, shakes it)

Look. Ideas. Okay?

PHOEBE

You're thirty-two years old, and you have

no career and no prospects.

BARRIS

Thanks for the status report, Phoebe.

Look, I just gotta come up with the right

concept. Then, boom.

(holds up notebook again)

Which, by the way, I've almost got.

PHOEBE

You're breaking mom's heart.     You know

that, don't you?

BARRIS

Somehow, and don't ask me why, Phoebe, my

being born broke mom's heart.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

Hey Phoebe, you ever see what's-her-name,

Tuvia, anymore?

PHOEBE

Who?

BARRIS

Tuvia.   Your friend.   Tuvia.   The girl.

PHOEBE

Oh. No. I heard something. I think she

got divorced recently or something.

BARRIS

Oh, yeah?

27.

OLDER TUVIA

Yes?

(registers)

Well, if it isn't Strawberry-dick Barris.

BARRIS

Hi, Tuvia.

OLDER TUVIA

What do you want?

BARRIS

I came by to apologize.

OLDER TUVIA

Okay then.

OLDER TUVIA (CONT'D)

Well, if it isn't Strawberry-dick Barris.

Now what do you want?

BARRIS

So I'm back in town. For a while.      I

thought maybe you and I could --

OLDER TUVIA

Jesus, you've got to be kidding.

28.

BYRD

You're a pretty angry young fella, aren't

you? Can't fight worth a damn though.

BARRIS

Screw off, fag. Don't think I haven't

seen you watching me in that bar for a

week now.

BYRD

Kind of a loner, I'd say. Fairly bright.

A tad anti-social. Mad at the world.

Can I buy you lunch?

BARRIS

Look, there's a schoolyard half a block

down. Why don't you go trolling there?

BYRD

I could teach you at least thirty

different ways to kill a man with a

single blow, Mr. Barris.

BYRD (CONT'D)

Might help you in future bar fights.

Just a thought.

BYRD (CONT'D)

Oh, and there's money in it.    Good money.

29.

BARRIS

(mouth full)

... and I figure if I can keep afloat

until I come up with my next game show

idea, then all will be copacetic.

BYRD

That sounds great, Chuck. Y'know, I've

never known a television producer before.

I'm impressed.

BARRIS

Yeah, yeah. So what's this money deal

you were talking about?

BYRD

Well, I work for a government agency, and

I can always use good, enthusiastic men

to help me carry out my directives.

BARRIS

What kind of work?   What government

agency?

BYRD

(matter-of-fact)

Problem solving work.   For the Office of

Diplomatic Security.

BARRIS

Office of what? Never heard of it.     Is

that the fucking CIA or something?

BYRD

Please be discreet, Mr. Barris.

BARRIS

(whispering)

Jesus, it is the fucking CIA! Hell, I'll

be a spy! Where do I sign up? Are you

fucking with me? You're fucking with me,

aren't you?

BYRD

Hardly. And you wouldn't be with the

company. You'd be a contract agent.

Independent. No official tie to any

agency. Is that understood?

(CONTINUED)

30.

BARRIS

(beat)

Why me?

BYRD

As you know, I've been watching you. For

years, actually. I've only let you know

about it for the last week.

BARRIS

Jesus.

BYRD

I'm happy to report you fit our profile,

Mr. Barris. Are you interested in this

work?

BARRIS

Well, what's the profile?

BYRD

Are you interested in this work, Mr.

Barris?

BARRIS

Yeah, sure, I wanna be a secret agent.

Contract agent. Whatever. Get to fuck

beautiful Eastern European women. Wear a

trenchcoat. Sounds like a kick.

BYRD

The work we do is very serious. It's

essential in quelling the rise of

communism and allowing democracy to gain

its rightful foothold around the globe.

BARRIS

Sure.    Yeah. Okay.   That's good.

(CONTINUED)

31.

INSTRUCTOR #1

There are several efficient methods of

killing a man, were you to find yourself

without a weapon. The edge of your hand

against the adversary's Adam's apple.

(demonstrates on mannequin)

This will crush the windpipe causing

strangulation and death.

INSTRUCTOR #1 (CONT'D)

Boxing your adversary's ears with proper

force will cause his ear drums to burst

and possibly result in bleeding in the

brain. And death.

BARRIS

You're training me to be a killer.

BYRD

See, Chuck, I knew you were fairly

bright.

BARRIS

I can't kill people.    My future is in

television.

BYRD

Listen, you're thirty-two years old and

you've achieved nothing. Jesus Christ

was dead and alive again by thirty-three.

Better get cracking.

BARRIS

I have ideas for shows.

BYRD

Oh, good. Why don't you spend another

six months developing 'em while staring

out the window at mommy's house next to

poor dead Albert the dog.

BARRIS

How do you know all that?

(CONTINUED)

32.

BYRD

I know everything about you, Chuck. For

fuck's sake, I know which hand you jerk

off with.

BYRD (CONT'D)

Right. Leave in the morning, if you

want. But I'm here to tell you this is

honest work for good pay. You'd be

helping to make the world safer. And

your country would be grateful.

BYRD (CONT'D)

It'll toughen you up.

(CONTINUED)

33.

INSTRUCTOR #1

Glycerin is, of course, the best-known

nitrating agent. Now keep in mind,

nitroglycerin is extremely unstable. A

slight tap, a one degree change in

temperature and it'll blow up in your

hands. Yee-haa, let's mix us up a batch!

INSTRUCTOR #1 (CONT'D)

Everybody take your 75 ml beaker and fill

it to the 13 ml level with fuming red

nitric acid, 98% concentration.

(CONTINUED)

34.

BYRD

Salvador Panagra Renda, gentlemen.

BENITEZ

Si.   In the flesh.

BYRD

What have you got for me, Manny?

BENITEZ

(re: map)

Renda leaves his apartment every day at

8:30, alone, walks east two blocks to

this news kiosk, buys a paper and heads

south four blocks to the plaza of the

Museum Nacional to read it.

BYRD

Okay. Chuck, you're here at 8:25. Dress

like a tourist. Start walking north.

You should pass Renda here. Stop him and

ask him in bad Spanish where the museum

is. Make sure he doesn't understand what

you're asking.

BARRIS

Okay.

BYRD

(to Brazioni and Benitez)

You'll be parked here. Brazioni, you're

behind the wheel. Benitez, you're on the

street leaning into the car chatting with

Benitez. When Chuck stops Renda, you

turn to help with the directions, stick a

gun into Renda's ribs, and direct him

into the back seat. Chuck, you get in

first. Renda's between you and Benitez.

Brazioni, whaddaya got?

BYRD (CONT'D)

Nice. You got suppresers with those, I'm

assuming.

BRAZIONI

I am not an imbecile.

BYRD

(smiling)

Glad to hear it.       Wasn't sure.

(CONTINUED)

35.

BARRIS

(to Byrd)

Where are you going to be, Jim?

BYRD

Poolside, Chuck.

BYRD

(not looking up)

Hola, Chuckito. Que pasa?

YOUNG BARRIS

So what'd this guy Renda do anyway?

BYRD

It's your job to follow directives, not

question their validity.

BARRIS

It's just...

BYRD

He's a bad guy, Chuck.   He's one of the

bad guys. Okay?

BARRIS

Bad for the U.S., right, Jim? Not bad in

an absolute sense, just bad for the U.S.

BYRD

Don't fuckin' dance with me, Barris.

Renda's bad for the Tea and Biscuit Co.

He's bad for me personally. You work for

me, and Renda's bad for me. You're now

officially a patriotic citizen of the

United States of Jim Byrd.

YOUNG BARRIS

Look, this is --

BYRD

There's no backing out now, Chuck. We've

let you in on everything. So you don't

play, you don't leave Mexico. Comprende?

(CONTINUED)

36.

YOUNG BARRIS

I was just --

BYRD

(softening)

I like you. I really do. And you're

gonna do fine tomorrow. And we're gonna

become great friends. And you're gonna

have a very nice little career. But

you've got to grow up. There's a war on.

YOUNG BARRIS

What war?

BYRD

(walking away)

That's not your concern.

BARRIS

Excusa me, por favor, Senor.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

Donde es-bla ra-ba-blala los bloteros?

RENDA

No comprende.

BARRIS

Ra-bla-bla-mamos las minjares?

BENITEZ

May I be of some assistance here?

BRAZIONI

Day of the dead.

RENDA

Por favor. No me mates, senor.   Tengo

tres bebes.

BARRIS

Again.

RENDA

Que?

BARRIS

Repitolo.

Again.

RENDA

No me mates. Tengo tres bebes.

(CONTINUED)

38.

BARRIS

Oh Christ.     Oh crap.

BYRD

Beautiful country, isn't it?

YOUNG BARRIS

Yeah.

BYRD

You did us proud, Chuck.

BYRD (CONT'D)

Renda was a bad guy. He really was.

BARRIS

Yeah.

BARRIS (V.O.)

I had changed. I could see it in my

eyes. Something dark.

RENDA

No me mates. Yo tengo tres bebes.

39.

BARRIS

"Don't kill me. I am three babies." I

am three babies? What the fuck does that

mean?

(studies dictionary)

Oh. "I have three babies." Oh, God.

PENNY (O.C.)

(groggily)

Chuck, is that you throwing up?

BARRIS

Jesus Christ, Penny. You scared the shit

out of me. What are you doing here?

PENNY

Sorry. I just been crashing here for a

few days. Waiting for you. Where you

been, man, where you been?

BARRIS

Mexico.   Just on a little vaca...

PENNY

You drank the water, didn't you?

BARRIS

Yeah.

PENNY

You're not supposed to. Montessori's

Revenge. You're not even allowed to open

your mouth or your eyes when you take a

shower. It's crazy. How come our water

is so good and their water is poison?

It's the same ocean.

(CONTINUED)

40.

BARRIS

I don't know.

PENNY

It's weird, huh?

(beat, then proudly)

So I'm a hippy now. Look.

PENNY (CONT'D)

I've been in San Francisco, and it's

amazing. Everybody loves everybody and

there's lots of colors. We're gonna

change the world, Chuck. Come back with

me and be my old man, okay? Not that

old! Ha ha ha.

BARRIS

Penny, I'm a little tired now, so...

PENNY

Oh!   You gotta hear this song!

PENNY (CONT'D)

(singing)

"Cause I made my mind up, you're going to

be mine..."

BARRIS

Penny, what did you do to my wall?

PENNY

(looking)

Oh, it's a guy who called a couple a days

ago. Gold-Bird. Isn't it pretty?

BARRIS

Leonard Goldberg?! You're kidding?

(dials phone anxiously)

Hello, this is Chuck Barris returning for

Leonard Goldberg.

(CONTINUED)

41.

GOLDBERG (PHONE VOICE)

Hi, Chuck!

BARRIS

Mr. Goldberg! I'm so sorry I didn't get

back to you right away. I was out of

town. Vacationing in Mexico.

GOLDBERG

Good for you. Listen, Chuck. We've

ended up with a damn hole in our daytime

schedule. I've been reviewing some

options, and it occurred to me there

might be a place here for you and your

baby.

BARRIS

My baby, Mr. Goldberg?

GOLDBERG

The Dating Game.

(joshingly)

That is your baby, isn't it, Chuck?

BARRIS

Yes sir, it is.

GOLDBERG

Are you still interested?

BARRIS

Yes sir.   Very interested.    Sir.

GOLDBERG

Good man. We'll need to start airing in

about six weeks. Is that do-able for you

and your people?

BARRIS

My people?     Six weeks?   Sure.   Yes sir.

GOLDBERG

Great.   Keep me posted.

PENNY

Damn Mexicans and their water.

BLONDE BACHELORETTE

Bachelor number two, what would I like

most about you?

BEANPOLE BACHELOR

I am very romantic and I would send you

flowers every day.

BLONDE BACHELORETTE

Aww. That's sweet. Bachelor number

three, what would I like most about you?

FRIZZY-HAIRED BACHELOR

My big cock.

BRUNETTE BACHELORETTE

Bachelor number one, what nationality are

you?

HANDSOME BACHELOR

Well, my father is Welsh and my mother is

Hungarian, so I guess that makes me Well-

Hung.

BLACK BACHELORETTE

Bachelor number three, I play the

trombone. If I blew you, what would you

sound like?

43.

GOLDBERG

Chuck, quite frankly these episodes are

unairable.

BARRIS

Look, Len, the show's spontaneous, it's

unscripted. That's it's charm. I can't

control what people say.

EXECUTIVE

Be that as it may, Mr. Barris, we can't

have black men getting blow jobs on

national television!

GOLDBERG

The point isn't that he's black, Hank.

EXECUTIVE

(beat)

Well, I know that. That's not what I

meant.

BARRIS

Look, Len, nobody is indifferent to these

shows. Right? And that's good. Show

business must avoid indifference at all

costs.

EXECUTIVE

Even when taste is involved?

BARRIS

Taste is just a word.

EXECUTIVE

You don't fuck with taste, my friend!

BARRIS

(uncomprehending)

What does that even mean?   I don't even

under --

(CONTINUED)

44.

GOLDBERG

Chuck, we cannot air this stuff. That's

it. If you can't figure out how to

retain your spontaneity without the

contestants being lewd, we're going to

have to pull the show.

BARRIS

Hi, folks. Before we begin taping today,

I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Peter

Jenks of the Federal Communications

Commission.

INSTRUCTOR #1

(increasingly psychotic)

Thank you, Mr. Barris. I don't know if

any of you are aware of this, but it's a

federal offense to make licentious

remarks on a network television

broadcoast. The penalty for this

disgusting, un-American behavior is one

year in prison or a ten thousand dollar

fine or both. Anyone making a sick,

subversive remark tonight will be

arrested immediately. I will then

personally escort the offender to federal

prison for booking under edict number 364

of the Broadcast Act of 1963. And it's a

long drive to that prison. Just you and

me. No other witnesses --

BARRIS

(jumping in)

Any questions?

(CONTINUED)

45.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

Okay.   Have fun, everybody!'

ACTUAL BARRIS

Sometimes as a younger man I stretched

the truth to get what I wanted. "Through

all the lying days of my youth/I swayed

my leaves and flowers in the sun;/Now I

may whither into the truth." Yeats. You

heard of him?

INTERVIEWER (O.C.)

Yeah.   Of course.

ACTUAL BARRIS

Sure you have.

(beat)

Anyway, my little lie worked. We aired

and become a big hit. A phenomenon,

really.

BARRIS

(into phone)

Terrific, Rod! Yeah, I'll get back to

you on Monday. Great. Thanks. Bye.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

(yelling)

Ice! Ice! Ice! Ice! Ice!

LORETTA

Jesus, Barris, take a Darvon.

BARRIS

Hey, baby.

LORETTA

Asshole.

BARRIS

I know.    Sit. Talk to me.

LORETTA

I'm busy. We're in the middle of a

bachelorette crisis out there.

BARRIS

I just got a call from the network.

Drink?

LORETTA

You got any weed?

BARRIS

I wish.

LORETTA

Then I'll have a drink.   Bad news?

BARRIS

The Tammy Grimes Show is being pulled

from Saturday night.

LORETTA

(mock concern)

Oh my God!

(drily)

So?

(CONTINUED)

47.

BARRIS

They want to put a prime-time version of

the Dating Game on in its place.

LORETTA

Shit! You're kidding!     That's fucking

great!

BARRIS

But they say the day-time version's not

hot enough. They want me to make it more

exciting for night-time. I got forty-

eight hours.

LORETTA

What do you have so far?

BARRIS

Nothing. Bupkis. I mean, the show is

what it is. I don't have a clue. This

could be my big break, Loretta.

LORETTA

Yeah, I know. Don't blow it.

BARRIS

Thank you for your help.

LORETTA

(not looking back)

Hey, I brought the ice.

BYRD

Boy, didn't I teach you anything?

(CONTINUED)

48.

BARRIS

You son of a bitch!

BYRD

You're so rusty, it's embarrassing.

BARRIS

You're a stupid fucking turd, you know

that?

BYRD

Can I buy you lunch?

BYRD

Ah, lighten up, hombre.

BARRIS

My fucking neck hurts.    Okay?

BYRD

Poor baby. Look, I've been put in charge

of a fairly large wet operation and I

could use your help.

BARRIS

Have you noticed, Jim, I've got a tv show

on the air? I don't need to kill people

for hire anymore.

BYRD

I know you don't need to.    But you'd like

to.

BARRIS

That's insane.

BYRD

Think of it as a hobby. An avocation.

Something you do to relax. You can be an

assassination enthusiast, a murder bug.

(CONTINUED)

49.

BARRIS

I've got important things to think about

here. I don't have time to fuck around

with you.

BYRD

Okay, I'll help you out with your little

show. Tit for tat. That's the kinda guy

I am. I've seen this Dating Game of

yours, Chuck. And I have a thought.

BARRIS

What, now you're a television producer?

BYRD

Hey, I'm CIA operative John Q. Public

when it comes to tv and that should make

my opinion of interest to you.

BARRIS

Let's hear it then.

BYRD

Well, what do you have now? The couple

gets sent to some stupid second-rate

Hollywood shitcan restaurant, right?

Sets you back fifty bucks? That's not

too exciting a prize to us vicarious-

living boobs out in TV-land.

BARRIS

Yeah, what's your point?

BYRD

Up the stakes, Chuckles. Send 'em to

some exotic locale. Europe, Southeast

Asia, for example.

BARRIS

The network's not going to let me send

two unmarried kids on vacation together.

BYRD

(shrugs)

Send 'em with a chaperone. Some

respectable old lady with a sewn closed

snatch.

BARRIS

(considering)

Y'know, that's not half bad.

(CONTINUED)

50.

BYRD

I'm telling ya. And... And sometimes you

can be the chaperone, Chuckie. Let's say

we have a job for you in Austria. You, a

successful tv producer, above suspicion,

chaperones the young couple, and while

you're there, blam! you take care of some

Company business. It's the perfect

cover. TV producer by day, CIA operative

by night.

BARRIS

I told you, I don't have to kill people

for money anymore.

BYRD

Chuck, when I said you fit our profile,

very little of that had to do with you

needing the money. Some of it, but very

little. You liked it with Renda, Chuck.

I saw it in your eyes. You liked it but

you botched it. Don't you want to get

really good at something, Chuck?

DIRECTOR

(rapidly)

Ready one, take one. Ready three, take

three. Ready one, take one.

BLONDE BACHELORETTE

Number one, can you please tell me what a

girl is like who hasn't been on a date

before and how you can tell she hasn't

been on a date before?

DIRECTOR

Ready two, take two.   This guy has never

been on a date.

(CONTINUED)

51.

FAT BACHELOR

Well...

BARRIS

Jesus, she's gotta pick this guy.   This

is just too good.

FAT BACHELOR

... I'll ask her what she likes to do and

--

DIRECTOR

Ready one, take one.   Ready two, take

two.

FAT BACHELOR

And if she doesn't know what she likes to

do --

DIRECTOR

Ready three, take three. The only date

he's ever had is with his right hand.

FAT BACHELOR

... then I'll know she hasn't done it

yet.

BARRIS

Excuse me, is this seat taken?

WOMAN

By you.

(CONTINUED)

52.

BARRIS

London is wonderful this time of year,

isn't it.

WOMAN

Yes it is.

BARRIS

(beat)

Oh. Sorry.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

Excuse me, is this seat taken?

PATRICIA

By you.

BARRIS

London is wonderful this time of year,

isn't it?

PATRICIA

Especially the fog. It affords one

solitude, even in a city full of people.

BARRIS

I'm Chuck.

PATRICIA

Yes, I gathered.

BARRIS

And you are?

PATRICIA

(smiles)

Here you go, Chuck.

BARRIS

At least give me a made-up name.

Something for me to cry out during those

dark nights of the soul.

(CONTINUED)

53.

PATRICIA

Cry out, "Olivia!"

BARRIS

That's Twelfth Night.

PATRICIA

Very good, Chuck. I'm pleasantly

surprised. You're not like the other

murderers.

FAT BACHELOR

I thinks he's really pretty and I want to

be her boyfriend.

ENGLISHMAN

(loud whisper)

Here.

BARRIS

Do you have it?

ENGLISHMAN

Do you have it?

BARRIS

Sorry.     Yeah.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

Don't worry, we're not gonna cheat you.

ENGLISHMAN

Just the same.

(CONTINUED)

54.

BARRIS

Thank you.     Oh, one more thing.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

Sorry about your teeth.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

It's Ronnie, isn't it?

BARRIS (CONT'D)

C'mere, Ronnie. I want to show you

something neat. It's okay.

ACTUAL BARRIS

I felt bad about Ronnie. But really I

did that ugly, fat, stupid kid a favor.

He was ugly and fat and stupid. More

life wouldn't have changed that for him.

No woman would ever have loved him.

That's just the brutal truth, y'know?

(CONTINUED)

55.

BARRIS

Olivia?

PATRICIA

It's Patricia, actually.

DISSOLVE TO:

PATRICIA

... and so then I spent a year in

Operation Chaos, inside the anti-war

movement as an agent provocateur, nudging

it toward violence in order to discred

it. That was fun. I got to wear granny

glasses.

BARRIS

Sounds fun. So tell me, Patricia, why'd

you come up here tonight?

PATRICIA

I don't know. You're sort of cute in a

homely way. And it's always lonely when

that civilian you're fucking calls out

the name off your fake passport.

BARRIS

"All the information I have about myself

is from forged documents."

PATRICIA

Nabokov.

BARRIS

Actually, I just gotta go into the

bathroom and take care of something.

(CONTINUED)

56.

PATRICIA

No, baby.    Leave the microfilm in.

BYRD

Hey, buddy. This is Simon Oliver.

BARRIS

Hey.

BYRD

Everything go okay?    You don't look too

good.

OLIVER

Mr. Barris, do not ever again jeopardize

one of my missions by killing a game show

contestant. Is that understood?

BARRIS

You're welcome, pal.

OLIVER

Do I make myself clear?

BARRIS

Fuck you!    They're my contestants.

OLIVER

Amateur.

57.

BARRIS

Faggot.

BYRD

Chuck --

OLIVER

Lovely. Tell me, Mr. Barris, are you in

possession of my microfilm?

BARRIS

Yeah, I got it.

OLIVER

Let's have it then.

BARRIS

It's up my ass, Oliver. Why don't you

reach on up there and get it.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

I just feel I deserve some appreciation

for my efforts.

OLIVER

What do you think Patricia Watson was?

BARRIS

Prick.

LORETTA

Well, if isn't the hitman.

BARRIS

(turning, wild-eyed)

What?

OFFICE WORKERS

Hitman!    Hitman! Hitman!   Hitman!

(CONTINUED)

58.

LORETTA

I said, well, if it isn't the hitman.

Just heard through the grapevine that ABC

is going to pick up The Newlywed Game.

BARRIS

You're kidding me.

LORETTA

Not kidding you. Day-time and prime-

time.

BARRIS

Oh, fuck, Loretta.     That's sensational!

OFFICE WORKERS

Hitman!    Hitman! Hitman!

ACTUAL BARRIS

The Newlywed Game was based on my theory

that almost any American would sell out

their spouse for a washer-drier or a

lawnmower you can ride on. Such was my

respect for that most holy of unions. I

must've been on to something, because the

show aired for thirteen years.

PENNY

Great wheels, man.

BARRIS

Yeah, I decided to start treating myself

right. You spend so much time denying

yourself things. Life's too short.

PENNY

Yeah, I really gork what you're saying,

man.

(CONTINUED)

59.

BARRIS

You really grok what I'm saying, man.

Not gork.

PENNY

Oh.

Really?

PENNY

(looking around)

Outa sight! Buy this one.

REAL ESTATE AGENT

Hi. Welcome, folks. If you wouldn't

mind signing-in on our sheet over th --

BARRIS

I'll take it.

REAL ESTATE AGENT

I'm sorry?

BARRIS

I'll take the house.

PENNY

Yay!

REAL ESTATE AGENT

(beat)

Very good, sir.

PENNY

So, man, are you seeing anyone?

BARRIS

Nobody serious. You?

(CONTINUED)

60.

PENNY

No.   I think we should get married.

BARRIS

Aw, Pen, don't start --

PENNY

No, listen, it makes sense. You and I

feel exactly the same about marriage,

right? How much bullshit it is, right?

And the odds of us finding someone else

with the exact same view on it are small.

So, it makes sense.

BARRIS (V.O.)

I liked Penny. I even loved her in my

way. But the idea of tying myself down

for the rest of my life... I remember my

parents' marriage.

DISSOLVE TO:

MOTHER

We need a new ice box.

ANNOUNCER

A brand new Amana refrigerator-freezer

with automatic ice maker!

61.

BARRIS

Beautiful. Did you see that? How much

they loved each other just then? That's

what it's all about, kiddies.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

Okay, guys, new business. We're winning

our slots every week.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

But that means we need you Bandits to get

on the contestant mill. Our supply of

dumbfucks is lagging behind our demand

for dumbfucks. And I'm gonna be

introducing three new shows in the coming

months: The Parent Game, The Game Game,

and the Dollar Ninety-Eight Beauty

Pageant, so we're gonna really need you

guys to carry your weight. Nuff said.

Any other business?

EMPLOYEE #1

Yeah. Rick took four slices of pizza at

lunch yesterday. Everyone else only got

two.

BARRIS

Oooh.    Is that true, Rick?    Where are

you?

RICK

Here.    No, it's not true.

BARRIS

Any other witnesses to this alleged

infraction?

EMPLOYEE #2

I saw it.    He took four.    I only got one.

BARRIS

Rick, you're dead meat, buddy.

(shoots Rick with finger)

I sentence you to... dance for us in

today's post-meeting version of "Out of

Limits" featuring the musical stylings of

the CBP Stompers.

RICK

Aw, Chuck.

BARRIS

Get up here, you rascule, you.

JIM LANGE

Sometimes Chuck would just disappear for

weeks. I remember once we had a conflict

on the set over the right way to throw

that kiss at the end of the show,

y'know...

(demonstrates kiss)

... and Chuck was just not reachable to

resolve it.

INTERVIEWER (O.C.)

What was the conflict?

JIM LANGE

Look, it's water under the bridge.     I'm

not gonna talk about it.

63.

BARRIS

The word's interpret.

PENNY

Interpet.

BARRIS

Interpret.

PENNY

Well, do you have an extra "r" then I

could borrow?

BARRIS

I'm not going to give you a letter.

You're lucky I don't make you forfeit a

turn.

PENNY

Oh.   Okay.

BARRIS

I'll run to the store and get some more.

PENNY

All right.

BARRIS

Don't cheat.

PENNY

You neither.

64.

PENNY

Intrepet's a word, right?

BARRIS

Intrepid.

PENNY

Shit fuck piss.

(concentrating)

Okay okay okay...

BARRIS

Pen, we should call it a night.     I'm

kinda tired.

PENNY

You're tired.

BARRIS

I got a date.

PENNY

Since when?

BARRIS

I just met this girl.

PENNY

Like, just now ?

You mean just now?

BARRIS

Yeah.    Kinda.

PENNY

Well, that's rude.

Yes, I have.

ACTUAL BARRIS

God, she had the softest, fleeciest clam

I ever experienced. It took a little

more work than usual, but I got in there,

baby.

(smacks lips, then stares off

into space)

It was some clam. Oh Lordy. You get

old, y'know, but the taste for soft clam,

it just doesn't go away. This is the

great tragedy of getting old.

Getting married to Alan is the best thing

I've ever done. It's just so wonderful

knowing that you've got someone by your

But you're sure, right?

MONICA

I hate you so much right now.

BARRIS

Look, we'll take care of it.

MONICA

How?    Are you gonna marry me?

BARRIS

(carefully)

Well, no. Not at this point.

MONICA

I'm not murdering my baby!

I can't... do that. Please...

I can't I can't I can't I can't...

BARRIS

It's okay.     It'll be okay.

PENNY

What a waste.

BARRIS

Tell me about it. I figure over the

years I must've spent close to twenty

grand on these abortions: airfare,

hotels, doctors, gifts.

PENNY

That's not what I meant.

BARRIS

And I don't even know how many of these

fetuses were mine. That's what really

kills me.

WOMAN #1

It was his.

WOMAN #2

Yeah.   It was his.

WOMAN #3

It wasn't his. I lied.

WOMAN #4

Yes, it was his baby.

WOMAN #5

Yeah.

WOMAN #7

I was screwing a lot of guys at the time.

It coulda been his.

WOMAN #8

Uh-uh. I just needed someone to pay for

it. He was a wallet with legs.

WOMAN #9

Yeah, I was just a kid.   It ruined my

life.

ACTUAL BARRIS

I don't really want to talk about this.

PENNY

So I'm assuming this means Monica is out

of the picture.

BARRIS

Yeah, I got baptized for nothing.

PENNY

Chuck, I was thinking... I have this

plan now, now that you're free --

BARRIS

God, you look cute today.

PENNY

I always look cute. Don't distract me.

What was I going to say?

BARRIS

I don't know.

PENNY

You do know.

(enthusiastically charged)

Chuck, why don't we get married? We've

known each other forever. We've fucked

each other forever. You think I'm cute,

you just said. You always come to me

when you're in trouble. And you're

almost forty, Chuck.

BARRIS

I know how old I almost am! That's it.

Don't ever ask me to marry you again!

PENNY

I won't.

I'm sorry I yelled at you today, Pen.

PENNY

I'm not crying because you yelled at me.

This is it, isn't it? This is us.

Shit piss fuck, send him in.

FLEXNER

Chuck!    Great to see you.

BARRIS

What's up, Rod?

FLEXNER

Well, the thing is, Chuck, some of your

shows aren't doing too well in the old

ratings war. The Family Game, for one.

BARRIS

Okay.

FLEXNER

And How's Your Mother-in-Law is, quite

frankly, in the toilet, Chuck.

72.

FLEXNER

Now, as you know, Dream Girl is flailing

terribly.

FLEXNER

And The Game Game has no life in it at

all.

FLEXNER

So I've been put in the unfortunate

position of having to inform you that the

network is canceling all four of these

shows. Now don't shoot me, Chuck, I'm

just the messenger.

BARRIS

(to bartender)

They killed my babies. Just like that.

I pushed them into the world through the

birth canal of my imagination. Lovingly.

Tenderly. Where's the humanity of these

people?

BARTENDER

The fucking bastards.

BARRIS

Hey there, can I buy you a drink?

LARGE MAN

What are you blind, asshole?   This lady's

BARRIS

(screaming)

Fuck you!

BARRIS (CONT'D)

Let's see, if I remember correctly, the

next move breaks your neck, which kills

you instantly or paralyzes you.

Depending on your luck.

LARGE MAN

Please.

BARRIS

(lets go)

Get out of here, you pussy faggot piece

of shit dog-shit shithead.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

(to the woman)

Hi. I'm Chuck Barris, tv producer.   Have

you ever done any acting?

PENNY

Hey, I was just in the --

PENNY (CONT'D)

What is she doing here, man?

BARRIS

She's --

(CONTINUED)

74.

PENNY

This is our house, man. Our house! It's

one thing to go elsewhere for your pussy

needs. But this is our house!

BARRIS

This is not our house, it's my house.

PENNY

It's our house! I found it with you. I

decorated it for you! I spent six months

sitting on that fucking couch she's

fucking you on, fucking waiting for the

fucking plumbers to come! God, you are

such an asshole!

WOMAN

I should go. This doesn't feel right.

Dear Chuck,

I'm dead now. I hope you're happy.

The door's open.

Love always,

Penny

(CONTINUED)

75.

PENNY

(face down)

Wanna see a stupid girl vomit?

PENNY

Why were you with that girl in our living

room?

BARRIS

It's not our living room, Pen.

PENNY

That's your defense?   You know what it

feels like to see you with someone else?

In any living room.

BARRIS

You know who I am, Penny.    I don't force

you to hang around.

PENNY

(incredulous)

You don't force me?   Fuck. So you're

saying you have no interest in this, one

way or the other?

BARRIS

No, I'm not saying that.

PENNY

Well, then, what are you saying, Chuck?

Do you want me around or not? Do you

even like me?

BARRIS

Of course I like you.

PENNY

How much?

BARRIS

What?

PENNY

I need to know how much you like me.

(CONTINUED)

76.

BARRIS

(beat)

I don't even know what that means, "how

much?" How can I rate a person in that

way? That's ridiculous.

PENNY

You could if you felt it. If you felt

it, it would be easy to rate me. You

could spread your arms as wide as they

would go and say, "This much, Penny."

BARRIS

Everything's complicated, Pen.    Nothing's

black and white like that.

PENNY

Do you want me around or not? If you

don't, just say so, so I know. Okay?

BARRIS

I love you, Pen, in my way. Maybe not in

that crazy, head-over-heels thing, but

what is that, anyway? Romantic love.

Isn't that just an illusion?

PENNY

(beat)

But you just said you love me, right?

BYRD (O.S.)

Over here, Strawberry-dick.

BARRIS

Jesus, how do you know these things?

BYRD

We even know what she actually thought it

tasted like.

(CONTINUED)

77.

BARRIS

Really? I could never find that out.

What did she think?

BYRD

It's a "need to know", my friend.   So

tell me, what can I do you for?

BARRIS

I could really use an assignment, Jim.

To straighten my head.

BYRD

I got something for your head.

JIM LANGE

... and we're the sending the two of you

for three days and three nights to

beautiful... West Berlin!

BARRIS

Treesh.

PATRICIA

Leibchen.

(kisses him, sits)

So, here's what we got.   Name's Hans

Colbert.

Other side of the wall.   We don't like

him very much.

(CONTINUED)

78.

BARRIS

(singing Toot-toot-tootsie)

Bye-bye, Colbert, bye-bye.

PATRICIA

You'll work with a kraut named Keeler.

He's been trailing Colbert for a month

now. Knows the routine. Keeler's a

drunk, so you stay sober and take charge.

BARRIS

(collecting photos)

Done and done. See you after?

PATRICIA

Prove how much you love me, baby.   Kill

for me. Then I'm all yours.

BARRIS

What you writing, Sig?

KEELER

I am keeping track of all the goings on

BARRIS

(falsetto)

Who is it?

HOUSEKEEPER (O.S.)

Housekeeping, Mr. Barris.

BARRIS

Good morning, Mrs. Reynolds.

HOUSEKEEPER

(looking around)

Another rough night, huh?

BARRIS

(tapping his head)

The human psyche is a wondrous thing.

HOUSEKEEPER

(smiling maternally)

Yes, I know it is.

(taking gun)

We don't need this now, do we?    Why don't

we just put this away?

BARRIS

Mrs. Reynolds, may I rest my head on your

bosom for a little while?

HOUSEKEEPER

Oh, that doesn't really seem like a very

good idea, Mr. Barris.

BARRIS

I'm sorry. You're right. I just... I'm

just without... comfort of any sort, and

I... please forgive me.

(CONTINUED)

81.

HOUSEKEEPER

(smiles at him)

No harm done.

BARRIS

(bowing)

Thank you. Thank you.      Thank you.   You

are a scholar and...

HOUSEKEEPER

It's fine, sir.

BARRIS

Mrs. Reynolds, what do you suppose God

thinks of someone like me?

HOUSEKEEPER

God?

BARRIS

Yes, God.

HOUSEKEEPER

Well, Mr. Barris, your television shows

have brought laughter and joy to millions

of people. That's a very important

thing, I think, in these difficult times.

I would imagine God likes you very much.

BARRIS

Thank you, that's very kind.

(glances at her ample bosom)

So... I should get back to...

HOUSEKEEPER

Yes, of course, sir. Don't mind me.

(CONTINUED)

82.

BARRIS

I'm really, really fucked.

PICARD

Get in.

BARRIS

What?       Who the hell are you?

PICARD

No time.      Get in or die.

PICARD

Merde. KGB. They know who you are,

Monsieur Barris. It is their intention

to kill you very much in East Berlin.

BARRIS

Merde!   MERDE!

PICARD

Not to worry, my friend.

PICARD (CONT'D)

I am Paul Picard, by the way. Nice to

meet you. Do not worry, I am not KGB.            I

do not want to kill you, I want you to

live a long happy life and have many

dancing grandchildren to admire.

83.

BARRIS

What the hell is that?

PICARD

Your ride, Monsieur Barris.

BARRIS

No fucking way.

PICARD

It's quite reliable and easy to operate.

It will get you over the wall. Or you

can stay here. In the German Democratic

Republic. I will arrange for you to get

a good factory job. No, you must fly,

like Daedalus before you, to the freedom

of the west.

BARRIS

Christ.   What about you?

PICARD

They do not catch me, monsieur. This is

my talent, to get away always. In

guerre. In amour. This is my talent,

and perhaps this is my curse.

BYRD

(chuckling)

So, did you have a nice flight?

(CONTINUED)

84.

BARRIS

Fuck you, Jim. It was terrifying.

BYRD

Seems the KGB knew exactly what you were

up to. You were there to kill Colbert,

they were there to kill you. I'm

thinking we got a mole. So much hate in

the world, Chuck.

BARRIS

Am I in danger still?

BYRD

Jesus, yes. KGB didn't go out of

business since yesterday, so far as I

know. You're fucked, Chuck. But our main

concern should be: if they know who you

are, they know who I am.

BARRIS

Fuck off.     What do we do?

BYRD

Bow out. Lay low. That's what I'm gonna

do. You're lucky you have another career

to immerse yourself in.

BARRIS

Thank you.     Thanks.   That was great.

EXECUTIVE WOMAN

I don't know, Chuck. It's looking bleak.

BARRIS

There's gotta be somebody in America with

some talent. Ted Mack got bookings every

week.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

Bring in the next thing.

DISSOLVE TO:

BARRIS

(ushering out)

Thank you. Thank you. We'll be in

touch. That was wonderful.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

We've been going about this all wrong.

Rather than killing ourselves trying to

find good acts, we just book bad ones and

kill them.

EXECUTIVE #2

Chuck, it's torture to sit through even

one of these people --

BARRIS

We kill 'em before they're through. As

soon as it gets unbearable, we kill 'em.

Dead.

EXECUTIVE WOMAN

For God's sake, what are you talking

about?

(CONTINUED)

86.

BARRIS

Celebrity judges ring a bell to end the

act... to kill 'em. And when you kill

something, it stops. This I know to be

true.

HOST

Why'd you do that, Jamie? This is

someone's grandmother. She was really

trying.

JAMIE FARR

This is The Gong Show, not the Van

Cliburn eliminations.

HOST

This is a human being with aspirations.

BARRIS

(muttering)

Oh, fuck me. This guy sucks.     He's

bringing everyone down.

EXECUTIVE WOMAN

None of the hosts are getting it, Chuck.

But we have a thought.

BARRIS

What?

EXECUTIVE WOMAN

You host.

EXECUTIVE WOMAN (CONT'D)

You get it. And we believe your awkward,

non-professional, mumbling persona is

exactly right for the show.

BARRIS

I don't want to be on tv.

Listen, we can't sit through anymore of

these test shows. Do it, Chuck, or we

Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to The Gong

Ucchhh.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

And now, here's the host and star of our

Welcome to The Gong Show. Here's an

esoteric act if there ever was one.

Ephemeral. It's an ephemeral act.

Why?   Why?     Why?

BARRIS

I don't know. I don't understand.

BARRIS

I lack confidence?

EXECUTIVE WOMAN

But we'll take care of that. We'll get

Confidence powder?

Nose candy, Chuck. Blow. Snow.        Flake.

Blow, snow, flake?

Oh.   Coke.     Okay.   Does that work?

ACTUAL JAYE P. MORGAN

Chuck was real different on stage and

off. Very tense. He was always looking

over his shoulder. Even when we were

fucking. Sort of an enigma.

GENE GENE

Oh yeah, a real Jekyll and Hyde.

Sometimes nice as you please. Give you

the shirt off his back. Other times he'd

rant like a crazy man. I remember once

he screamed at me that I didn't know

anything about dancing. "Nijinsky," he

yelled, "now there was a dancer!"

BLACK COMEDIAN (CONT'D)

My mother-in-law...

JAMIE FARR

Chuck used to love to discuss philosophy.

I think he was very saddened that the

public saw him as this sort of spastic

moron. I remember at the time I was

reading Wittgenstein. And Chuck was just

thrilled to have someone else in addition

to Rex Reed to talk about that stuff

with.

BARRIS

Look, Jamie, you know as well as I that

language does not exist without an

outward criteria.

JAMIE FARR (TELEPHONE VOICE)

Certainly.  Wittgenstein said as much in

Investigations. But if you read Ryle

carefully --

PATRICIA

Chuck...

BARRIS

Can we pick up tomorrow?

(CONTINUED)

92.

JAMIE FARR

Yeah. But consider my thinking on

elementary propositions. I'm serious.

BARRIS

Will do.   Love ya.

JAMIE FARR

Right back at ya, amigo.

PATRICIA

I'm concerned about you. I think you

need to get back into the life. Our sex

was always amazing after you killed.

Truth is you're not that great after your

discussions with Jamie Farr.

PATRICIA (CONT'D)

Oh, c'mon.

BARRIS

(picks up)

Jamie, I can't talk anymore tonight --

KEELER (O.S.)

(telephone voice)

This is Siegfried Keeler.     I need to see

you.

BARRIS (V.O.)

Assassins do not fraternize. That Keeler

was calling me could mean it was my turn

to get hit.

KEELER (O.S.)

(phone voice)

I am in town on business, Chuck. And I

desire nothing more than your company for

dinner. I consider you one of my closest

friends.

BARRIS

Sure. Dinner sounds good. There's a

place called La Scala. See you there at

eight.

PATRICIA

(eyes closed)

Dinner sounds good with whom?

BARRIS

Keeler.

KEELER

A very fancy place.

BARRIS

Only the best for my friend.

KEELER

The friendships one develops during

wartime are remarkably strong.

BARRIS

Yes.

KEELER

So how is the business of television?

BARRIS

Well, it's hit and miss. I've got a new

show called "Operation Entertainment"

which I believe is going to kill. It's

sort of a Bob Hope visiting the troops

thing, but it's weekly and...

(CONTINUED)

94.

KEELER

Why do you do what you do, Chuck?

BARRIS

Well, I like to think that I bring joy

and laughter to millions of people. I'm

not saying that my shows are as good as

they could be. Yet. But --

KEELER

Why do you kill?

BARRIS

Oh.

KEELER

During the second world war, I had the

pleasure of killing. Yes, pleasure. I

found it exhilirating. Afterwards, I

could find nothing else to fill me so

much with life. So I became what I am

today. I wanted the exhiliration

again... of death.

WAITER

Are you gentlemen ready to order?

KEELER

I'll have the shrimp scampi and a green

salad.

WAITER

And for you, sir.

KEELER

Um, Just give me a steak.    Rare.

WAITER

Thank you.

KEELER

with thy whole might. Work while it is

called, for the night cometh wherein no

man can work."

95.

BARRIS

That's Carlyle!

KEELER

Yes.

BARRIS

It's amazing you should quote him.   He's

my hero.

KEELER

I read in a book recently that killing

your first man is like making love to

your first woman. Every smell, every

nuance, you remember with a special

allure, as if the acts had occured

outside civilization, outside time. And

when the allure is gone, you are

condemned.

BARRIS

Condemned?

KEELER

I am condemned to live the rest of my

life outside civilization. You will be

too, my good friend.

ACTUAL BARRIS

The next day I heard Keeler offed

himself.

ACTUAL BARRIS (V.O.)

You never really know in the world of

espionage if something labeled a suicide

actually is a suicide. But he was dead.

That I knew.

PENNY

When you called, I wasn't gonna come.

BARRIS

I'm glad you did, Pen.

PENNY

I said to myself, enough.      Enough of this

jerk already. Enough.

BARRIS

I could see how you would feel that way.

PENNY

But I've come upon something interesting

through my delvings into human

psychology. It's called TA, Transactual

Analysis.

BARRIS

Transactional Analysis.

PENNY

Now see, by correcting me you're

responding as "Parent" to my "Child."

(authoritative voice)

"Here's the proper way to say this word,

Penny." But that's okay. As long as we

both understand that's what you're doing.

Y'know, I'm okay, you're okay. So what's

wrong, Chuck? Are you okay?

BARRIS

A guy I knew killed himself last night.

PENNY

My God. Everyone you know kills

themselves. Or tries. Who is it this

time?

BARRIS

You don't know him.   A stagehand.

PENNY

Why'd he do it?

BARRIS

He didn't like his work anymore.

Is being a stagehand really bad or

something?

Um, Penny, this is Patricia.

How did you find me?

PATRICIA

Are you serious? That's what I do for a

living.

Who's Patricia? What does she mean,

that's what she does for a living?

You're dead in my book, Strawberry-dick.

How dare you subject the rest of the

BARRIS

I don't think it's that loathsome.

PRETTY WOMAN

What is it then? To mock some poor,

lonely people who just crave a little

attention in their lives. To destroy

them. So everybody's not brilliantly

talented. They're still people. They

Look, what do you want, Oliver? I don't

work for you anymore. I have things

to...

OLIVER

I'd like you to come back for one last

assignment, Chuck.

BARRIS

No.     Now get... Good-bye

OLIVER

I think you might be interested when I

tell you it's the mole who fingered your

friends Jim Byrd and Paul Picard... and

Seigfried Keeler.

BARRIS

Keeler committed suicide.

OLIVER

Yes, of course he did. He threw himself

from a twentieth floor window after he

strangled himself to death with an

electrical cord.

BARRIS

(beat)

I'm not interested, Oliver.

OLIVER

As long as the mole's alive, you don't

have a chance in hell of remaining so.

Besides, killing is in your blood, old

man. You fit the profile.

BARRIS

That fucking profile again! What's the

fuck is it?! What the fuck do you

bastards know about me, that I don't?!

OLIVER

Indeed.   Where to begin.   First, let go

of me.

(CONTINUED)

111.

OLIVER (CONT'D)

Let's see. Well, you had a twin sister,

stillborn, strangled by your umbilical

cord. Your first hit, Chuck. Your

mother always wanted a daughter. She

blamed you for your sister's death. And,

so, until your sister Phoebe was born,

she raised you as a girl.

BARRIS

That's not true.

OLIVER

Oh, and your father the dentist? Not

really your father. Your biological

father was a man named Edmund James

Windsor. A serial killer. A fact your

mother didn't know when she had an affair

with him in 1930. If you want to look

him up, he was also known as the

Tarrytown Troll, because he had been

described by witnesses as short and ugly.

Windsor died in the electrical chair at

Ossining in 1939. We believed your self-

loathing tendencies coupled with that

extra Y chromosome and whatever else you

inherited from your father would serve us

well.

BARRIS

You're lying.

OLIVER

I'm trying to think what more I can tell

you. I'm sure there's more. But you have

me at a disadvantage here, Barris. I

don't have your files in front of me.

BARRIS

Just leave me the hell alone!

OLIVER

Your mother always loved the game shows,

and you so wanted to please her. We

never expected the game show business to

work out for you. But that it did,

turned out to be in our favor. I guess

your need to be a good daughter drove you

more than we anticipated.

(CONTINUED)

112.

DISSOLVE TO:

BARRIS

Huh?     What?

PENNY (O.S.)

Chuck?    It's Pen.

PENNY (CONT'D)

Oh, Chuck.

BARRIS

Jesus, how'd you find me? Am I listed in

some guidebook or something?

PENNY

You sent me your last letter on hotel

stationary.

BARRIS

Oh. Well, it's great to see you, Pen.

You look beautiful.

PENNY

I don't really. But I appreciate the

lie. I know how you hate lying.

(looking around)

Boy, this place is scary looking.

BARRIS

Yeah.

(taps his head)

The human psyche.

(CONTINUED)

113.

PENNY

I came to take you back to California

with me. It's a lonely state without

you.

BARRIS

I don't know, Redhead.

PENNY

I can't wait forever for you to ask me to

marry you, you know. Well, apparently I

can. But I really don't want to. Chuck.

BARRIS

Pen.

PENNY

(crying)

I love you so much. You don't

understand. I don't even know why.

You're such a schmuck.

BARRIS

You don't know the half of it.

PENNY

You're not gonna marry me, are you?

BARRIS

I don't know if I can.

PATRICIA

I can't believe you finally left your two-

hundred-dollar-a-night cave to see me.

I'm honored.

BARRIS

Y'know, I got a visit this morning from

Penny. She's wanted to marry me forever.

But she doesn't know who I am, what I've,

what I'm capable of.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

114.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

And she can't ever know. So what does

she really love? A lie. And I started

thinking, Treesh, you are the only woman

in the world who truly knows me. I know

I've screwed you over in the past, and

I'm really sorry. I just want you to

know that you're the one I want to be

with. I love you, Treesh.

BARRIS

I hate myself for how I've lived, Treesh.

PATRICIA

Neitzsche said, "Whoever despises oneself

still respects oneself as one who

despises."

BARRIS

I never thought of that. Jesus, I can't

even despise myself with any insight.

PATRICIA

Insane asylums are filled with people who

think they're Jesus or Satan. Very few

have delusions of being the guy down the

block who works at an insurance company.

Wonder what that means.

BARRIS

Y'know, I wanted to be a writer once. I

wanted to write something that someday

some lesser person would quote. But I

never did. I'm the lesser person,

Treesh. I never said anything meaningful

that wasn't said by somebody else first.

I am disposable. I disposed of people

and I am disposable.

(beat)

You look cold.

PATRICIA

Chuck, what's gotten into you? You're

actually acting like a gentleman.

(CONTINUED)

115.

PATRICIA (CONT'D)

Well, it's late. I should get going.

BARRIS

I suppose you still won't tell me where

you're staying.

PATRICIA

No.   But I'll show you.

PATRICIA

Drink?

BARRIS

Sure.    Bourbon.

PATRICIA

I've been thinking a lot about you

lately, Chuck.

BARRIS

Yeah?

PATRICIA

I've missed you.

BARRIS

You could've fooled me.

PATRICIA

Well, I've mellowed.

PATRICIA (CONT'D)

Look. Boston's a beautiful city. We

could start over here. A normal person's

life. Together. Selling insurance.

(CONTINUED)

116.

BARRIS

That sounds right.

PATRICIA

To life.

BARRIS

To life.

BARRIS (CONT'D)

(bitterly)

L'Chaim.

BARRIS

It's done and I'm done.   Agreed?

OLIVER

Agreed.   But if you get antsy... and you

will.

BARRIS

Hey, Redhead?

JUSTICE OF THE PEACE

Penny Pacino and Chuck Barris.

PENNY

You said that already.

BARRIS

Okay.

(beat)

Okay, but what you don't know is that

I've brutally murdered thirty-three

people for the CIA.

ACTUAL BARRIS

Y'know, I came up with a new game show

idea recently. It's called The Old Game.

You got three old guys with loaded guns

on stage They look back at their lives,

see who they were, what they

accomplished, how close they came to

realizing their dreams. The winner is

the one who doesn't blow his brains out.

He gets a refrigerator.

BLACK.
