V.O. NARRATION

"The economic explosion following

the Civil War created an

unprecedented nation-wide market

for beef.  Previously worthless

cattle running wild throughout

Texas were gathered into herds

And driven north to the railheads

In Kansas.  Fortunes were made as

Cowtowns sprang up on the

Prairies, wide-open centers of

Commerce and vice, their streets

Choked with heavily-armed young

Men fresh from the cattle drives.

In those days the correct term

For a cowhand was 'drover'.

'Cowboy', like 'cowpoke', was

originally an insult implying

deviant sexuality and was rarely

used.  But these invading drovers

were a wild breed for soon

shootings and wholesale drunken

riots became so frequent that

ordinary citizens literally could

not walk down the street.  In fact

at their height the cowtowns had

higher murder rates than modern

New York or Los Angeles and there

Was no law but that of the gun."

V.O. NARRATION

"Straight-up at 75 yards or eye-

to-eye at point-blank range, the

greatest gunman of all time was

an Illinois abolitionist farm boy

named James Butler Hickok, better

known as Wild Bill, the Prince of

Pistoleers.  But Wild Bill worked

His trade on the side of justice

And as marshal of cowtowns like

Hays City and Abilene he became a

Legend, the one man who stood

Between law and chaos."

V.O. NARRATION

"Wild Bill's fame spread nation-

wide but his end came quietly in

the spring of '76 when a strange

cross-eyed little drifter put a

bullet through the back of his

head, apparently for no other

reason than he wanted to kill a

celebrity."

V.O. NARRATION

"In Dodge City meanwhile, Wyatt

Earp and Bat Masterson were

Becoming known as fast-guns.  But

Their fame had nothing to do with

Shooting."

V.O. NARRATION

"Earp and Masterson operated more

like modern policemen, using

teamwork and persuasion to keep

order.  Still, sometimes things

got out of hand."

V.O. NARRATION

"But Wyatt had a guardian angel."

V.O. NARRATION

"John Henry 'Doc' Holliday was

the son of an aristocratic,

highly cultured southern family.

Trained in Philadelphia, he had

Embarked on a career as a society

Dentist when he contracted

Tuberculosis.  Advised to practice

In the west where it was thought

The climate and clean air would

Prolong his life, Doc soon

Realized it was all only a matter

Of time and gave up dentistry to

Become a professional gambler and

Gunman..."

V.O. NARRATION

"Others headed east.  Bent on

becoming an actress.  Josephine

Marcus defied her wealthy and

Very proper San Francisco Jewish

Family to run away with a

Traveling theatrical company,

Braving the perils of the

Frontier on her own.  Dangerous as

This might seem, it was another

Age and women were so rare, their

Presence so cherished that they

Could travel virtually anywhere

In the west in perfect safety."

V.O. NARRATION

"At about this time the Texas

Rangers, having eliminated the

Commanche threat, turned their

Attention to the outlaw gangs

Marauding along the Rio Grande,

Cleaning up the border strip in 4

Years of hard riding.  Those they

Could not indict or convict the

Rangers put down in their Black

Book, letting it be known that

They could either leave Texas or

Face summary execution.  This

Resulted in the mass migration of

The absolute dregs of the Texas

Underworld to the most dangerous,

Uncivilized part of the entire

Country, the southeast corner of

The Arizona Territory."

V.O. NARRATION

"Harsh and inhospitable, savaged

in turn by the Apache and Mexican

bandits, this had always been an

accursed place, a virtual hell on

earth where it was thought life

itself could never prosper, much

V.O. NARRATION (cont.)

less civilization.  Then in 1879,

a prospector named Ed Schiefflin

set off alone into the Dragoon

Mountains.  Friends told him he

Was crazy, that the only thing

He'd find in this Godforsaken

Place would be his tombstone.

Instead he found silver, lots of

It, and overnight the town of

Tombstone sprang up.  Mining

Taking out millions in ore.  Land

Value shot sky-high and

Speculators and gamblers and

Opportunists of all nations

Scrambled in by the thousands to

Make Tombstone queen of the

Boomtowns, so rich that the

Latest Paris fashions, hard to

Find even in the biggest cities,

Were sold there by the wagonload

From the makeshift storefronts."

V.O. NARRATION

"Meanwhile, the exile Texans had

banded together to form the

nucleaus of an organized gang.

Seizing controp of the

Surrounding countryside they

Robbed stagecoaches at will while

The big absentee business

Interests employed them as tax

Collectors and strongarm men.  But

The backbone of their trade

Remained border rustling,

Periodic raids into Mexico to

Steal cattle while engaging in

What was described as a virtual

Orgy of murder and violence.  The

Raids became so frequent and so

Bloody that the Mexican

Government formally protested to

U.S. President Chester A. Arthur,

Prompting heated debate in

Congress.  General Sherman

Declared that the only possible

Way of bringing order was to send

In the army but in the wake of

Civil War Reconstruction federal

Intervention in civilian affairs

Was politically impossible."

V.O. NARRATION

"With only some 100 members, the

gang was an elite body of gunmen,

known by the red silk sashes they

wore around their waists.

Fiercely proud of their

Terrifying reputation and

Answerable to no one, they were a

Law unto themselves, finally

Emerging as one of the earliest

Examples in American history of

Full-scale organized crime."

V.O. NARRATION

"They called themselves the

Cowboys."

CAPTAIN

It's them, only an hour north.

YOUNG RURALE

But this is the border.

CAPTAIN

You saw what those animals did at

That rancho.  You think a border

Is going to stop me?  No, I'm

Going to see them suffer for what

They did!  I swear it on my soul!

CAPTAIN

Turn around!  Fast!  Now!

OLD MAN CLANTON

Tell 'em to get on their knees.

FLORENTINO

He will not kneel.  He is proud.

CURLY BILL

So how'd you like our little

Carry-on over at that rancho?

Kinda hit the spot didn't it?

CAPTAIN

Animals!  Butchers!

OLD MAN CLANTON

Hey, somebody get that stick on

His knees.

CURLY BILL

Gracias.

OLD MAN CLANTON

They call me Old Man Clanton.  I'm

What you might call the founder

Of the feast.  Now maybe you ain't

Heard, but we skylark through

Your dingy little country just

About any time we damn well

Please and big-hat, crummy-

Lookin' free-holes stumblin'

Around in the dark ain't allowed.

Messican po-lice, huh?  Think

You're bad medicine, don't you?

Hell, I've let stronger stuff run

Down my leg.  So next time we come

Better step aside.  Get in our

Hair again, we'll saw your prods

Off with butter knives and stuff

CURLY BILL

Hold up, jefe.  Got a joke I wanna

Tell you.

FLORENTINO

He say he know you killing him.

CURLY BILL

Now how'd he figure that out?

FLORENTINO

He say he is no' afraid, someone

Will revenge for him.  A sick

Horse.

CURLY BILL

A sick horse?  What the hell...

FLORENTINO

Something, I don't know, he talk

Fancy, you know, like a priest.

Is like, "a sick horse who sits---"

RINGO

That's not what he said, you

Ignorant wretch.  Your spanish is

Worse than your English.  Come on,

Let's get it over with.

RURALE CAPTAIN

You go to hell!

RINGO

You first.

TOM

Looks like you had a party!

CURLY BILL

Oh, we had a big time!

The Old Man, Curly Bill, and Ringo rein up and look out at the

sun rising magnificently from the desert floor.  The Old man

stretches his legs in the stirrups, taking out a whiskey

flask.

OLD MAN CLANTON

Ain't that sweet?  That's why I

Stay out here.  Thank you, God.

CURLY BILL

What'd the Messican mean, a sick

Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make

No sense.

RINGO

He was quoting the bible,

Revelations: "Behold a pale horse

And the one that sat on him was

Death and Hell followed with him."

CURLY BILL

Well now that's a little more

Like it.

DAKE

"Dear Governor Gosper-in re

yours directing action against

Cowboys, stop.  Beg to inform have

Twice sent deputies to serve

Warrants on Cowboy suspects,

Stop.  Nothing to show for it but

2 dead deputies, stop.  Short of

deputizing U.S. Army am at loss-

DEPUTY

The tall man over there, Marshal.

I'm not sure but I think that's

Wyatt Earp.

DAKE

Duty, now I'd like to get on with

My life.  That is if you don't

Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.

DAKE

Huh.  All right, fine, wish you

Luck.  Tell you this though, never

Was a rich man yet didn't wind up

With a guilty conscience.

WYATT

In the saddle.

MATTIE

Oh, he can go all right.

ALLIE

MATTIE

Rather ride than eat.

VIRGIL

MORGAN

Give him some good exercise?  Sure

Some stud.  Some string in fact.

WYATT

Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.

LOUISA

Bottle right here.  Just be

MATTIE

You're a lifesaver!  Don't worry,

VIRGIL

Found her.  Same place we found

Ours probably

WYATT

Come up to the fire, honey.

MATTIE

I think I'll just lie down awhile

MATTIE

Long as I live I'll never

Get used to that sound.

WYATT

They're just lonely is all.  Hell,

I howl myself sometimes.

MATTIE

You get lonely?

MORGAN

Come up, Lou.  Come up here, girl.

LOUISA

WYATT

Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new

Money Ward, too.  33 years old

Watch.  'Bout time I started

Lookin' out for myself.

VIRGIL

Well here we are a family again.

Been so long plain forgot how

Good it feels.  Want to thank you

For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.

WYATT

We're gonna do it, boys.  Gonna

Get ours.  Feel it in my bones.

All we have to do is keep our

Eyes on that brass ring.

MORGAN

(lies back)

Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet

You can see every star there is.

Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes

You think, you know?  I mean you

Look up and you think God made

All that but he still remembered

To make a little speck like me.

Kinda flattering really.  Hey,

Wyatt, you believe in God?  No,

Come on, really, do you?

WYATT

Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.

MORGAN

Well what do you think happens

When you die?

WYATT

Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I

Don't know.

MORGAN

I read this book, book on

Spiritualism...

VIRGIL

Oh, God, here he goes...

MORGAN

...said a lot of people, when

they're dyin', they see this

light, like in a tunnel.  They say

it's the light leading you to

heaven.

WYATT

Really?  What about hell?  They got

A sign or what?

MORGAN

Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!

WYATT

Well that's your problem.  Hey

Virge, see anything of Doc while

You were in Prescott?

VIRGIL

Hit a streak when we left.  Him

And Kate.

ALLIE

(from the stream)

Uh, that woman.

WYATT

I miss Doc.  I miss that ol' rip.

VIRGIL

I don't

ALLIE

Neither do I.

WYATT

He makes me laugh.

BAILEY

I said that's 500 to you,

Holliday.  In or out?

DOC

500? Sly boots, must be a peach

of a hand.

KATE

Here, Doc.

DOC

Bless you, darling

(puts arm around her)

Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not

Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!

BAILEY

Oh, for Christ's sake!

DOC

Ed Bailey, you look like you're

Just ready to burst.  Well call me

A fool but I guess I'll just have

To call.  Cover your ears, darling.

BAILEY

God damn son of a...

DOC

Isn't that a daisy?

BAILEY

Just pick up your money and go.

Sick of listening to you simper.

DOC

Now Ed, are we cross?

BAILEY

Skinny lunger, your guns don't

Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns

You'd be nothin'.

DOC

Why Ed, what an ugly thing to

Say!  Does this mean you're not my

Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if

I thought you weren't my friend I

Don't think I could bear it.

DOC

There, now we can be friends

Again.  But remember, Ed,

Friendship is trust-so please

Don't hurt me.

KATE

Touch that gun, I burn you down!

BAILEY

Oh, my God...

DOC

Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.

DOC

Well, good evening then.

1ST GAMBLER

Judas...

DOC

I calculate that's the end of

This town.  And let's don't bother

About the luggage, darling.

KATE

I been having the boy at the

Hotel pack us up every night

Since your streak started

DOC

My sweet clever Magyar, so that's

Why you're not wearing a bustle.

STILLWELL

What're you lookin' at?

BEHAN

Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan,

I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just

Hit town?

WYATT

Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp,

These're my brothers-

BEHAN

Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?

WYATT

Gave all that up.  Going into business.

BEHAN

Well I'm the man to see.  Besides

Sheriff I'm also tax collector,

Captain of the Fire Brigade, and

Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti-

Chinese league.  A man of many

Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I

Also sit on the Townlot

Commission.  Got a couple of

Lovely cottages coming up for

Rent.  Here, let me show you...

BEHAN

The one next door and the one

Across the street are vacant too.

Same rent and I'll throw in a

Good cleaning.  Believe me, you

Won't find a better deal within

Town limits.

WYATT

Guess we'll take all three.

WYATT

...and easy on the grain, I don't

want 'em too fidgety.

MORGAN

Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.

WYATT

Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.

WHITE

Who, Behan?  He ain't no law, only

Real law here's the Cowboys.

VIRGIL

The Cowboys, yeah.  I heard of 'em.

WHITE

Nobody does nothin' without 'em.

They're it.  Hell, even the

Apache're scared of 'em.  There's

A couple right there: Sherman

McMasters and Pony Deal.  Can

Always spot a Cowboy, they all

Wear those red sashes.

VIRGIL

Look pretty rough.

WYATT

Just like any other hard cases.

Gotta know how to handle 'em.

WHITE

Well I'm no Wild Bill.  Way I

Handle 'em's just mainly live and

Let live.  That usually answers

But even so, gets kinda spooky

Sometimes.  Still somebody's gotta

Do it, I mean how the hell else

You gonna walk down the street?

VIRGIL

Doesn't anybody raise a stink?

The hell kinda town is this?

WHITE

Boomtown.  Wide open.  People

Grabbin' with both hands ain't

Got time for any law and order.

In fact the less law the more

Opportunities there are for

Makin' money.  Plain fact is the

Cowboys're good for business.

WYATT

What about all these saloons?

WHITE

Ah, now that's the real mother-

Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down

Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours

A day, liquor, hostesses,

Gamblin', makin' money hand over

Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On

Account of the element.  Have a

Man for breakfast in there most

Days.  Regular slaughter house.

High-rollers won't go near it.

Too bad, nice place.

JOYCE

What can I get you?

WYATT

Let me have one of those cigars.

(lights up, looks around)

Kinda nice in here.  You run it?

JOYCE

Milt Joyce, owner-operator.

WYATT

Well, excuse me for askin', Milt,

But isn't it kinda dead in here?

JOYCE

You see that bird at the faro

Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He

Barged in here one day, said he

Was takin' over the game, started

Slappin' customer, wavin' his

Gun around, scarin' off all the

High-class play.  Only trade comes

In here now's just bummers and

Drovers, just the dregs.

WYATT

Why don't you get rid of him and

Get yourself straight dealer?

JOYCE

Well sure, neighbor, easy to say.

TYLER

You back that Queen again, you

Son of a bitch, I'll blow you

Right out of that chair!

(looks up, sees Wyatt)

Somethin' on your mind?

WYATT

Just wanted to let you know

You're sitting in my chair.

TYLER

That a fact?

WYATT

Yeah.  It's a fact.

TYLER

For a man that don't go heeled

You run your mouth kinda reckless.

WYATT

Don't need to go heeled to get

The bulge on a dub like you.

TYLER

That a fact?

WYATT

Yeah.  It's a fact.

TYLER

Well I'm real scared.

WYATT

Damn right you're scared.  I can

See it in your eyes.

WYATT

Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that

Smoke wagon and see what happens.

TYLER

Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-

WYATT

I'm getting tired of your gas.

Jerk that pistol and go to work.

WYATT

I said throw down, boy.

WYATT

You gonna do something or just

Stand there and bleed?

WYATT

No, I didn't think so.  Here,

Milt.  Keepsake, hang it over the

Bar.  All right, youngster.  Out

You go...

WYATT

And don't come back.  Ever.

WYATT

See how easy that was?

WYATT

Well we're off and running.  Just

Acquired us a quarter-interest in

The game at the Oriental.

VIRGIL

Acquired?

WYATT

So to speak.

O.S. VOICE

Why Johnny Tyler, you madcap,

Where are you going with that

Shotgun?

TYLER

Doc.  I didn't know you were in town.

WYATT

Doc!  How the hell are you?

DOC

Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.

TYLER

Wyatt?  Wyatt Earp?

MORGAN

Going into business for

Ourselves.  Wyatt just got us a

Faro game.

DOC

Since when is faro a business?

WYATT

Didn't you always say gambling's

An honest trade?

DOC

I said poker's an honest trade.

Only suckers buck the tiger.  The

Odds are all with the house.

WYATT

Depends how you look at it.  I

Mean it's not like anybody's

Holding a gun to their heads.

DOC

That's what I love about Wyatt.

He can talk himself into anything.

DOC

Oh sorry, Johnny, I forgot all

About you.  You can go now.  Just

Leave the shotgun.

TYLER

Thank you.

WYATT

Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.

DOC

Forgive me if I don't shake hands.

BEHAN

So how's Tombstone treating you?

WYATT

Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin',

You know what this town really

Needs is a race track.

BEHAN

Actually, you know, that's not a

Bad idea, send a signal we're

Growing up.

DOC

Little ahead of yourselves,

Aren't you?  This is just a mining

Camp.

BEHAN

See how everyone dresses?  Awfully

Toney for a mining camp.  No, the

Die's cast, we're growing, be as

Big as San Francisco in a few

Years.  And just as sophisticated.

DOC

I can hardly wait.

DRUNK

You son of a bitch!

JOHNSON

That's right, keep comin', keep comin'...

DOC

(turns to Behan)

Very cosmopolitan.

WYATT

I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.

VERMILLION

Easy, gents. Private affair...

(spots Wyatt)

Wyatt! Doc! Hey!

WYATT

Jack...

DRUNK

You bastard!

JOHNSON

Yeah, good.  Right about there.

JOHNSON

Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!

WYATT

What was that all about?

VERMILLION

Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called

Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.

DOC

(turns to Behan)

Sheriff, may I present a pair of

Fellow sophisticates, Turkey

Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack

Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.

WHITE

'Fraid I'll have to have those guns.

JOHNSON

Fair fight.  We were legal.

WHITE

Sorry, boys.  Gotta take you

Before Judge Spicer.

VERMILLION

Well law and order every time,

That's us.

VIRGIL

What kinda town is this?

VERMILLION

Nice scenery.

BEHAN

That must be the theatrical

Troupe.  There's a show tonight at

Schieffelin Hall.

JOHNSON

Hey, Wyatt, you goin' to the

Show?  Maybe we'll see you there.

(turns to White)

Won't we.

WHITE

Yeah, probably.

DOC

Well, an enchanted moment

JOSEPHINE

Interesting little scene.  I

Wonder who that tall man was.

1ST ACTRESS

Typical frontier type.  Long and

Lean.  And those gray eyes.  Like a

Wild hawk.  You see quite a few of

His type out here.

JOSEPHINE

Oh, I want one.

HUNT

Hey, Sister Boy!

CURLY BILL

Shut up, Zwing.  Sit here, Billy.

ALLIE

This is so much fun!  We haven't

Been to a show since years.

MATTIE

I hope they're good.

STILLWELL

(shouting from below)

Lady, they better be good.

DOC

Kate, you know the Earps.

WHITE

Wyatt, this is Mayor Clum and his wife.

CLUM

Your reputation precedes you.  I wonder -

WYATT

Not a prayer.  Nice meetin' you.

WHITE

Well everybody's here except the

Old Man.  Got the blade, Billy

Grounds, Zwing Hunt, Billy

Claiborne, Wes Fuller, Tom and

Frank McLaury, Billy Clanton's

The youngest.  Wild one.  Then the

Breeds, Hank Swilling, Pony Deal.

Florentino's Mex-breed.  They all

Hate Mex, but he hates 'em

Special.  Johnny Barnes, Frank

Stillwell.  That's Behan's little

Deputy, Billy Breakenridge.

Follows the Cowboys around like a

Puppy.  And the big boys: Curly

Bill Brocius, he's the Old Man's

Rimrod; the one looks like an

Actor, that's Johnny Ringo.  Best

Gun alive they say.  He's kinda

Different.  Curly Bill's the only

One he talks to.  I mean they're

All rough boys, but Ringo... I

Don't know.  I really don't

BARNES

Professor Gilllman?  Oh hell, I

Seen him in Bisbee.  He catches stuff.

STILLWELL

Hey profesor!  Catch this!

GILLMAN

They shot me!  I don't believe it!

1ST ACTRESS

My God, they're shooting at us!

They're actually shooting at us!

What'll we do?

FABIAN

Only thing we can do, dear-be

Good.  In any event, at least we

Won't have to wait for our

Notices.  Exciting, isn't it?  Now

This is theater!

CURLY BILL

Prettiest man I ever saw

STILLWELL

How come he ain't wearin' no pants?

BARNES

(points to whores)

That's how come.

FABIAN

Ladies and gentlemen, the St

Crispin's Day Speech from Henry V.

To set the Scene, England is

Now at war with France.

Everything rests upon the battle

About to begin.  Henry, the young

King of England, addresses his men

Thusly: "My cousin Westmorland?

No, my fair cousin-"

FABIAN

"If we are marked to die, we are

enow/ To do our country loss; and

if to live./ The fewer me, the

greater the share of honour..."

BARNES

He's got nerve, I'll say that.

What do you think, Billy?

BREAKENRIDGE

Oh, he wonderful!

GROUNDS

Uh-oh, looks like somebody's in love.

CURLY BILL

Let him alone.

FABIAN

"We few, we happy few, we band of

brothers;/ For he today that

sheds his blood with me/ Shall be

my brother; be he ne'er so vile./

This day shall gentle his

Condition;/ And gentlemen in

England now a-bed/ Shall think

Themselves accurs'd they were no

Here./ And hold their manhood

Cheap whiles any speaks/ That

Fought with us upon Saint

Crispin's day!"

CURLY BILL

That's great!  That's our kinda stuff!

STILLWELL

He's gonna some up short on that one.

CURLY BILL

Know what I'd do?  I'd take the

Deal then crawfish and drill that

Ol' Devil in the ass.  How 'bout

You, Johnny?  What would you do?

RINGO

I already did it.

DOC

Very instructive

WYATT

But who was the Devil?

MORGAN

It's that woman from the coach!

WYATT

I'll be damned...

DOC

You may indeed.  If you get lucky.

WYATT

Comin' to the Oriental, Virge?

ALLIE

Not tonight! Tonight me and my

Old man're gonna have some fun.

Get moving, old man!

VIRGIL

Her maiden name was Sullivan.

WYATT

(kisses Mattie)

Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's

Where I leave you.

MATTIE

(grabs his hand)

No, stay.  Please stay with me.

WYATT

Honey, I gotta start makin' money.

MATTIE

Oh, all right.

WYATT

Well I guess I don't have to go

Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.

MATTIE

No, no, I don't want to keep you.

WYATT

No really, I can stay a while.

MATTIE

Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt,

Really.  Work well.

WYATT

All right, well, good night.

HIGH ROLLER

All right, I'm on fire!  Black

Seven, seven stickin' spades.

Let's go!

WYATT

I'm your man...

(deals card)

You win again.  Well played, sir.

You are on fire.

HIGH ROLLER

Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm

Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven

Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five

Thousand!  Let's go!

WYATT

Awful lot of money.

HIGH ROLLER

Can't take the heat, get outta

The kitchen.

WYATT

You're the doctor.

(deals card)

sad news, friend.

HIGH ROLLER

Damn!  All right, wait a minute...

WYATT

So now we're in the mining

Business.  Turning into regular

Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the

Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a

Kick out of that, it's her maiden

Name.

DOC

And what a maiden, pure as the

Driven snow, I'm sure.

MORGAN

Hey Doc!  Come on now.

WYATT

Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't

Mean anything.

DOC

So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious.

Do you actually consider youself

A married man?  Forsaking all

Others?

WYATT

Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I

Was no angel when we met but

People change Doc.  I mean sooner

Or later you gotta grow up.

DOC

I see.  And what would you do if

"she" walked in her right now?

WYATT

"She"?

DOC

You know damn well who I mean.

That dusky-hued lady Satan.

WYATT

I don't know.  Probably ignore her.

DOC

Ignore her?

WYATT

I'd ignore her.  People can

Change, Doc.

DOC

I'll remember you said that.

WYATT

Oh, hell...

WYATT

Satisfied?

DOC

I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're

An oak.

WHITE

Since when'd you start servin'

Ladies in here?

JOYCE

Actresses.  It's different.

BREAKENRIDGE

Here, Mr Fabian, have this table.

FABIAN

Oh, thank you.  You're very kind.

BREAKENRIDGE

Mr. Fabian, I've got to tell you,

That's the most wonderful thing I

Ever saw.  What was that?

FABIAN

Henry's all right but he's no

Match for the Melancholy Dane.

(sees his confusion)

Hamlet, dear friend, the supreme

Role of any actor worth his salt.

DOC

(leans in, points to Wyatt)

Here's a man you should meet, Mr.

Fabian.  Excellent character study

For you, the real-life actual

Melancholy Dane.

FABIAN

Indeed, sir?  How so?

DOC

Well he hems, he haws, he talks

Out of both sides of his

Mouth-but all on a very high

Plane, just like Hamlet.

WYATT

Getting drunk, Doc.

CURLY BILL

Wyatt Earp, huh?  I heard of you.

IKE

Listen, Mr. Kansas Law-dog.  Law

Don't go around her.  Savvy?

WYATT

I'm retired.

CURLY BILL

Good.  That's real good.

IKE

Yeah, that's good, Mr. Law-dog,

'cause law don't go around here.

WYATT

I heard you the first time.

CURLY BILL

Shut up, Ike.

RINGO

(steps up to Doc)

And you must be Doc Holliday.

DOC

That's the rumor.

RINGO

You retired, too?

DOC

Not me.  I'm in my prime.

RINGO

Yeah, you look it.

DOC

And you must be Ringo.  Look,

Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The

Deadliest pistoleer since Wild

Bill, they say.  What do you

Think, darling?  Should I hate him?

KATE

You don't even know him.

DOC

Yes, but there's just something

About him.  Something around

The eyes, I don't know, reminds me

Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I

Hate him.

WYATT

(to Ringo)

He's drunk.

DOC

In vino veritas.

RINGO

Age quod agis.

DOC

Credat Judaeus Apella.

RINGO

(pats gun)

Ecentus stultorum magister.

DOC

(Cheshire cat smile)

In pace requiescat.

WHITE

(enters, appeasing)

Come on now.  We don't want any

Trouble in here.  Not in any language.

DOC

Evidently Mr. Ringo's an educated

Man.  Now I really hate him.

WHITE

See what I mean about it getting

Spooky?

WYATT

Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that

Other idiot?

WHITE

Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest

Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff,

Makes him miserable.

WYATT

Yeah, and dangerous.

JOSEPHINE

The man dealing faro.  Who is he?

BEHAN

That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a

Name for himself as a peace

Officer in Kansas.

JOSEPHINE

A peace officer... Impressive man

BEHAN

Yes, very.  And very married.

JOSEPHINE

Oh, so that's it...

CURLY BILL

I feel like doin' somethin'.

Getting woolly.

(looks up)

Hey, Chinky!  Come here a minute...

KATE

That's my lovin' man.  Just can't

Get enough.

DOC

Enough?  Never.

HIGH ROLLER

Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"?

Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".

DOC

What?

HIGH ROLLER

You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh,

Susanna".  "Camptown Races",

Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!

DOC

I see, well this happens to be a

Nocturne.

HIGH ROLLER

A which?

DOC

You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.

MORGAN

Now that wounds me.  Little tin

Swain walkin' off with that black

Beauty.  I mean I'm a married man

And all but still, it ain't right.

CURLY BILL

Boy, I feel great!  Full of that

Hop I got from Chinky.  I feel

Just capitol!  You boys go ahead.

I'm gonna stick around awhile,

Howl at the moon.

WHITE

Curly Bill.  He's over across the

Street shootin' out the lights.

CLUM

This is great, this is just great.

BEHAN

Have you been out in the street?

Somebody's got to do something.

CLUM

You're the Sheriff.

BEHAN

It's not County business, it's a

Town matter.

WYATT

Why don't you just leave it alone?

WHITE

No, I gotta do something.  I don't

Suppose you'd card-

WYATT

None of my business, Fred.

WHITE

Hey, Curly?  Come on now, boy...

CURLY BILL

Well, howdy, Fred!

WYATT

Maybe I ought to go out there.

DOC

You will or you won't.  Don't look

To me.  I'm going to sleep.

WYATT

Go wake up Virgil.

(turns to Joyce)

Hey Milt, lend me a sidearm, will you?

WHITE

Hand that over.  Come on now.

CURLY BILL

Why sure, dad.  I'm only in fun.

Here she is.

WYATT

Put his clothes out.

IKE

Turn loose of him.

WYATT

He just killed a man.

BILLY

He said to turn loose of him.

WYATT

Well I'm not so go home.

IKE

Swear to God, Mister, step aside

Or we'll tear you apart.

WYATT

You.  Come here a second.

WYATT

You die first, get it?  The others

Might get me in a rush but before

That I'm gonna make your head

Into a canoe.  Understand?

BILLY

He's bluffin'!  Let's rush him!

O.S. VOICE

And you, you simpleton, you're next.

BILLY

Hell, he can't hit nothin'.  He's

So drunk he's probably seein'

Double.

DOC

I have two guns.  One for each of you.

VIRGIL

All right, look out!  Break it up.

Go home, all of you, go home now...

WYATT

Come on, you...

CURLY BILL

Crack me back of the head like

Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you

Ain't no fightin' man, you're

Just a cop.

WYATT

There.  He'll keep till morning

VIRGIL

Keep your eye on that brass ring.

Don't let anything side-track you.

WYATT

I know, I need a keeper.

BEHAN

Well I guess you can see, never a

Dull moment.  Maybe you should

Stay around to see what happens

Next.  Who know?  You might find a

Future here.

JOSEPHINE

Maybe even my destiny.

WYATT

...but he says did I actually see

it happen and I said, no, when I

arrived Fred'd already been shot.

So the judge said, can't have a

Murder without a witness-case

Dismissed.  Can you beat it?  After

All that.  Oh hell, who cares,

None of my business anyways.

MORGAN

Boy, I love this game.  When we're

Finally set we gotta each have a

Billiard room in our houses.

CLUM

Excuse me, Wyatt, just a moment,

Please, I wanted to try and

Reason with you.  We still haven't

Found a Marshal and-

VIRGIL

Come on Mayor, he already told

You no.

CLUM

What about you?  You were a lawman.

VIRGIL

I'm busy.  We're all busy.  Sorry,

Mayor, but you're really barkin'

Up the wrong tree.

WYATT

You tell 'em, Virge.

WYATT

You know, I was thinkin', maybe

We ought to open our own place.

That's the real money.  Build it

Up, milk it for all it's worth,

Then sell it off for a bundle and

Breeze out of this burg with more

Money than Croesus and ready to

Live like kings.  Let's you and me

Take a walk around town, Virge,

See if we can scout us out a

Couple of nice lots.

VIRGIL

I can't hardly believe it.  It's

Working out just like you said,

Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg

Six ways through Sunday.

WYATT

Pretty fun too, isn't it?

VIRGIL

Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.

VIRGIL

What're you up to today, son?

WYATT

Cat got your tongue?

WYATT

Wait a minute, Virgil!  Where you goin'?

VIRGIL

I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I

Looked at that woman and it was

Just like somebody slapping me in

The face.  I mean these people're

Afraid to even walk down the

Street and I'm trying to make

Money off it like some kind of

God damn vulture.  That's not me,

That's somebody I don't even know.

WYATT

Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.

VIRGIL

It's got nothin' to do with you,

Wyatt.  It's-

WYATT

Nothing to do with me?  I'm your

Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I

Don't believe this.

(turns to Morgan)

Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.

(no answer, pauses)

Oh no, don't tell me...

MORGAN

Like you said, Wyatt.  We're

Brothers.  Gotta back your

Brother's play.  Just did like I

Figured you would.

WYATT

Listen to me, both of you.  This

Is no good.  This is trouble we

Don't need.  For the first time in

Our lives we got a chance to stop

Wandering and finally be a

Family.  Do this and you throw it

All away.  You saw what happened

To Fred White.

MORGAN

Come on, we're not about pickin'

Fights.  Just gonna keep a little

Order, that's all.

WYATT

Yeah?

MORGAN

Like you said, just gotta know

How to handle 'em.  Old Fred

Wasn't up to it.  We know that

We're doin', Wyatt.

WYATT

All right, say you're right, say

You don't get yourself killed.

There's something else.

(turns to Morgan)

It's too late for Virge, he

Already rolled his bone.  But it's

Not too late for you, Morg.

MORGAN

What're you talkin' about?

WYATT

All the years I worked the

Cowtowns, I was only ever mixed

Up in one shooting.  Just one.  A

Man got killed.  Wasn't my fault,

Just doin' my job.  I don't even

Know if it was my bullet that

Dropped him, but... I don't kno,

It's sort of hard to explain.  At

First I just felt funny, you

Know, kind of clammy inside.  But

When it finally sunk in what I'd

Done... Believe me, boy, you

Don't ever want to feel that way.

Not ever.

(pauses)

Didn't even make a dent, did I?

(stands, exits)

You're both makin' a big mistake.

WYATT

This Hooker's ranch?

HOOKER

That's right.  And I'm Hooker.

WYATT

You seen anything of a man on

Horseback leading a black

Stallion?

WYATT

Well you must've seen somethin',

The trail runs right by your

Waterhole.

(no answer)

Oh, I see.  So it must've been a

Cowboy, right?  Really got you

People treed, don't they?

HOOKER

Look, Mister, it's fine for you

Boomers to court trouble, you're

Just passin' through.  Us

Cattlemen gotta live here.  Best I

Can do's point you up to the cut.

That's their roost.

MCMASTERS

Run for your lives, boys!  It's

That great two-gun dog-catcher

From Kansas!

WYATT

McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you

Seen a black stallion with-

MCMASTERS

Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk

To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.

WYATT

I'm not a lawman, I'm just a

Private citizen getting' my

Property back

MCMASTERS

Well in that case, I saw your

Horse.  Billy Clanton was takin'

Him up to the Cut to show him

Off.  The boys're all up there

Right now, branding.  And in a

Mood.  Still want your property

Back, Mr. Private Citizen?

WYATT

So what about you Cowboys anyway?

MCMASTERS

If I had to explain it you

Wouldn't understand.  Just say

We're brothers to the bone.

WYATT

Yeah, but some of the things they

Say your brothers've done...

MCMASTERS

There's all kinds of horses,

Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys.

What they do's their affair.  I

Don't preach and I don't judge.  I

Ain't no dog-catcher.

MCMASTERS

You seem like a nice fella.  Like

To've know you better.  Had you lived.

IKE

Hey, law-dog.  The hell you doin' here?

SWILLING

How 'bout I just drag you off

That horse and eat you blood raw?

WYATT

Where'd you get that horse?

BILLY

Beauty, ain't he?

WYATT

I asked where you got him.

BILLY

Where do you think?  I stole him.

WYATT

Look, I don't want any trouble

With you but that's my horse and

I mean to have him back.  One way

Or another.

BILLY

Come and get him.

WYATT

Look kid, I know what it's like,

I was a kid, too.  Even stole a

Horse once.  But you can't--

IKE

Don't sweet-talk him, make a move.

SWILLING

Yeah, go ahead, Mister.  Make a move.

CURLY BILL

Give him his horse, Billy.

IKE

Come on, Curly!  Don't let him-

CURLY BILL

Shut up.

Give him his horse, Billy.

CURLY BILL

Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just

Can't hold back when I'm feelin'

Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad.

But now we're square.  Anyway no

Use for holdin' a grudge.  I

Deserved a rap in the head.

WYATT

Make you a deal.  My brother took

Over the Marshal's office in

Tombstone.  Got it in his head

He's gonna make the place safe

For widows and orphans.  You and

Your boys stay out of his way,

I'll make sure he stays out of yours.

CURLY BILL

Fair enough.  You know I got to

Admit, you got a lot of bark on

You comin' up here like this.

WYATT

They were all gonna jump me back

There.  What ever happened to one

Against one?

CURLY BILL

Ain't our way.  We go all on one,

One on all.  Fight one of us, you

Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.

WYATT

And how come you call yourselves

Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.

CURLY BILL

Oh, we ride for a brand all right.

(gives Wyatt the finger)

This brand.  How 'bout you?

WYATT

(points thumb at self)

This brand.

CURLY BILL

We're gonna get along just fine.

CLUM

I can't thank you enough.  Since

You took over there hasn't been a

Single problem.  We're finally

Becoming a civilized town.

VIRGIL

Nothin' to it.

WYATT

Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe

Those Cowboys aren't near as bad

As they're painted.  You know I

Was thinkin', there's a lot of

Money in the cattle business...

VIRGIL

Wait a minute, you thinkin' of

Getting in bed with the Cowboys?

WYATT

Business is business.  Don't have

To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not

If there's money in it.

VIRGIL

You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.

YOUNG RURALE

The old one you kill.  This was my father.

OLD MAN CLANTON

(sits up suddenly)

What, and I'm supposed to

Tremble?  Kiss my ass, Messican.

STILLWELL

Old Man Clanton's dead!  Ambushed

In Guadaloupe Canyon.  Messican's

Got him.

CURLY BILL

All right, first thing's first:

It's my outfit now, I'm runnin'

The show.  Ringo's number two man.

IKE

Your outfit?  I'm next in line.

CURLY BILL

You ain't got enough in your

Britches.  Think you can prove

Otherwise, go ahead.

CURLY BILL

Anybody else?

CURLY BILL

All right.  Billy, go after Ike

And cool him off then go find the

McLaurys, tell 'em what happened

And keep an eye on things.  Wes

Fuller and Bill Claiborne, too.

Rest of you come with me.  We're

Goin' to Mexico.

WYATT

Oh, hell...

JOSEPHINE

Well, hello.

WYATT

We've never actually met.  My

Name's-

JOSEPHINE

Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was

Beginning to think we'd never

Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That

Means lucky.

WYATT

I know what it means.

JOSEPHINE

What is it?

WYATT

Easy now... That mare's in season.

JOSEPHINE

Oh...

(calms her horse)

Now she's starting.  How do they know?

WYATT

They know.  It's the scent.  We

Better split 'em up.

JOSEPHINE

I have a better idea, let's run

It out of them!

WYATT

Yeah, I'm an oak all right.

WYATT

You're not that crazy, are you?

JOSPEHINE

Oh, yes I am!

JOSEPHINE

That was lovely!

WYATT

You know you almost got us both

Killed back there?

JOSEPHINE

Fun though, wasn't it?

WYATT

You'd die for fun?

JOSEPHINE

Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I

Was sure you never laughed.

WYATT

I laugh sometimes

JOSEPHINE

Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are

You happy?

WYATT

Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy

As the next man, I guess.  I don't

Laugh all day long like an idiot,

If that's what you mean.

JOSEPHINE

You're a little touchy about it.

WYATT

I'm not touchy, I just, it's a

Silly question, that's all.  Am I

Happy?  Are you happy?

JOSEPHINE

Of course, I'm always happy.

Unless I'm bored.  That blonde

Woman, is that your wife?

WYATT

What about her?

JOSEPHINE

Nothing... Tell me, what do you

Want out of life?

WYATT

Where do you get these questions?

JOSEPHINE

Just answer.

WYATT

I don't know, make some money,

Have some kids, you know.

JOSEPHINE

Doesn't suit you.

WYATT

How would you know?

JOSEPHINE

Just doesn't, that's all.

WYATT

Well I ought to know my own mind

And I'm tellin' you what suits me

Is a family and kids.  That suits

Me right down to the ground.  In

Fact, that's my idea of heaven.

(pauses)

All right, what's your idea of heaven?

JOSEPHINE

Room service.

JOSEPHINE

See?  You're laughing again.  But

That's what I want.  Go places and

Move and never look back and just

Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea

Of heaven.  Need someone to share

It with, though.

WYATT

You mean Behan?

(sees her shrug)

Then why are you with him?

JOSEPHINE

Well he's handsome and he's

Charming.  He's all right.  For

Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm

Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've

Tried to be good but it's too

Boring.

WYATT

The way you talk.  Never heard a

Woman talk like that.

JOSEPHINE

Oh look, I haven't got time to be

Proper, I want to live.  I'm a

woman, I like men.  If that's

Unladylike then I guess I'm not a

Lady.  At least I'm honest.

WYATT

Well you're different, no arguing

That.  But you're a lady all right.

I'll take my oath on it.

JOSEPHINE

What's wrong?

WYATT

I don't know, doesn't make any

Sense.  I almost can't look at

You.  Like it hurts.

JOSEPHINE

I know, me too.  What should we do

About it?

WYATT

God...

JOSEPHINE

You know this is adultery.  You

Burn in hell for that.

WYATT

Then let's make sure we get our

Money's worth

JOSEPHINE

I must say this certainly has

Been an unexpected little

Windfall.

WYATT

Fortuitous even.

JOSEPHINE

And I don't even know your full name.

WYATT

Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.

JOSEPHINE

And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus.

My friends call me Josie.

WYATT

Josie... No, I'm gonna call you

Sadie.

JOSEPHINE

I hate Sadie.

WYATT

Well you'll always be Sadie to me.

JOSEPHINE

Always?

WYATT

Getting late.  We better get back.

JOSEPHINE

So I assume we're regarding this

As just a kind of interlude.

WYATT

Look, it's too much of a tangle.

I already cast my lot.  I can't go

Back and I can't sneak, feel back

Enough as it is.

JOSEPHINE

You feel bad about this?  About me?

WYATT

I didn't mean it that way.

JOSEPHINE

You know you don't have to sneak.

You could stay with me.  I know

Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I

Could make you so happy.

WYATT

I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.

FLY

What mood would you like for this

Picture, Miss Marcus?  Any

Particular occasion you're

Commemorating?

JOSEPHINE O.S.

I want to remember exactly how I

Looked on this day so I want you

To take a picture of me...

JOSEPHINE

...all of me.

JOSEPHINE

Because I'm wonderful.

WYATT

That the bottle Lou gave you?

Better go easy on that stuff.

MATTIE

I know what I'm doing.  Where have

You been?

WYATT

Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?

MATTIE

I don't know.  I'm all right.

WYATT

Really?  You sure?

MATTIE

Sure I'm sure.  What is this?

WYATT

Well, I was thinking, we've

Already made a pile of money.

Maybe we should just pull up

Stakes and move on.  And we could

Stay on the move, you know?  Just

Keep going, see the world.  Live

On room service the rest of our

Lives.  How'd that be?

MATTIE

Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?

WYATT

Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it.

JOYCE

New singer.  Ain't she somehin'?

MORGAN

Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours.

Clanton came in an hour ago, they

Switched over to poker.  Tried to

Get him to bed but he just won't

Let go.

WYATT

I know.  And nobody can make him.

DOC

Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.

WYATT

Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.

DOC

Nonsense, I have not yet begun to

Defile myself.

WYATT

(touches his shoulder)

But Doc-

DOC

I won't be pawed at, thank you

Very much

WYATT

Sorry, sorry...

KATE

(puts arm around Doc)

That's right.  Doc can go all day

And all night and then some.

Doc's my man.  Doc's my lovin'

Man.  Have another one, lovin' man.

BEHAN

What d'you think of the singer?

WYATT

Nice voice.

BEHAN

That's not what I meant.

IKE

Son of a bitch!  That's twelve

Straight hands!  Nobody's that lucky.

DOC

Why, Ike, whatever do you mean?

VIRGIL

Come on, boys, take it easy.

DOC

Maybe poker's not your game, Ike.

I know, let's have a spelling

Contest!

IKE

(stands)

I'll wring your scrawny neck for you!

VIRGIL

(grabs him)

That's enough, Clanton.

IKE

You takin' his part?  I'm the one

Was cheated. God damn pimps,

You're all in it together.

VIRGIL

Nobody's in anything, Clanton,

You're drunk.  Go home and sleep

It off.

IKE

Get your God damn hands off me!

Don't you ever put your hands on

One of us!  Don't you ever try to

Man-handle a Cowboy!  We'll out

Your God damn pimp's heart out!

Understand, pimp?

VIRGIL

Don't you threaten me, you

Little-

WYATT

Virgil, don't!  Take it easy!  Ike,

Just go home and forget it, will you?

IKE

I ain't forgettin' nothin.

BEHAN

I saw that look on your face just now.

What's between you and Wyatt?

JOSEPHINE

Absolutely nothing.

DOC

Well that certainly was a bust.  I

Want my money back.  Come,

Darling, let's seek our

Entertainment elsewhere.

KATE

What's wrong, Doc?

DOC

Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right

As the mail.

WYATT

Get a doctor!  Virgil, give me a hand.

IKE

What's wrong with him?

JOYCE

Lunger.

DR. GOODFELLOW

Your condition is quite advanced.

I'd say you've lost some 60 percent

Of your lung tissue.  Maybe more.

DOC

So what does that mean?

DR. GOODFELLOW

Two years, two days, hard to say.

If you have any chance, it's to

Stop now-smoking, drinking,

Gambling, night-life.  You must

Have a healthy diet and most

Importantly, you must have

Complete rest-meaning you must

Attempt to deny your marital impulse.

DOC

Well, that sounds inviting.

DR. GOODFELLOW

Sorry but I'm afraid you've no choice.

KATE

How you feeling, Doc?

DOC

Better.

KATE

That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.

DOC

We must talk, darling.  It appears

We have to... redefine the nature

Of our association.

KATE

What's that mean, Doc?  You know I

Don't understand when you talk up

High like that.  You mean you

Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?

DOC

Not exactly...

KATE

I'm a good woman to you, Doc.

Don't I always take care of you?

Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm

A good woman.

DOC

Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.

DOC

Then again, you may be the

Antichrist.

IKE

Bastards think they can cheat me?

JOYCE

Nobody cheated you, Ike.  Go home.

IKE

And I don't take no mouth from

Any bartenders neither.  There,

See?  Give somebody a rap on the

beezer, get some God damn respect

Around here.  Now you tell the

Earps and Doc Holliday if I see

'em on the street, I'm gonna send

'em all to hell on a shutter.  You

tell 'em that.

WYATT

What the hell's going on?

IKE

I want to send a telegram.

VIRGIL

Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and

Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six

Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.

WYATT

Just stay calm, use your head.

It'll be all right.  Just the

Same, though...

(pauses, sighs)

Guess you better swear me in.

MATTIE

Thought you swore you'd never

Carry that thing again.

WYATT

Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.

BEHAN

I'm terribly afraid this looks

Like the end of the Earp brothers.

VIRGIL

Here they are again.  Look at 'em.

WYATT

Easy, Virge, they're just tryin'

To egg us on.

MORGAN

What're you doin' out of bed, Doc?

DOC

What the hell's going on?  I've

Had five people walk up to me

Saying the Clantons and McLaurys

Are gunning for me.

FRANK

Like to teach those bastards a lesson.

BILLY

Probably already scared them to death.

TOM

You call it, Ike.  What're we gonna do?

IKE

(grabs bottle)

Gimme that.

JOYCE

Those Cowboys're tellin'

Everybody in town they're gonna

Clean you out.  They're down in

That lot right now behind the OK

Corral.

WYATT

Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem.

You don't have to mix up in this.

DOC

That's a hell of a thing for you

To say to me.

VIRGIL

What the hell're we gonna do?

WYATT

Wait till the liquor wears off.

Once they start getting headaches

They'll lose interest.

VIRGIL

Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.

WYATT

You'll never make that stick.

VIRGIL

They're carrying guns in town.

WYATT

Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You

Go down there to arrest 'em,

Something goes wrong, maybe this

Time somebody gets his head

Broke, suddenly it's a mess and

It won't end there, you'll have

Cowboys comin' around lookin' for

Trouble from here to Christmas.

You gonna risk all that over a

Misdemeanor?

VIRGIL

(pauses, thinking)

No, damn it, it's wrong, they're

Breakin' the law.

WYATT

(pauses)

All right, Virge, your call.  But

Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be

Less apt to get nervy if they see

Him on the street howitzer.

WYATT

Well... Come on, boys.

BEHAN

They're on their way over here.

JOHNSON

There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.

VERMILLION

Yeah.  Or undertakers.

WYATT

Virge, you're makin' the arrest.

You make contact, I'll back you

Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll

Keep an eye out for trouble.  And

Keep your hands on your guns.

They even look like they're gonna

Start something, buffalo 'em.

Right over the head.

VIRGIL

Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.

WYATT

(sees onlookers)

Look at 'em all.  They love it.

How in the hell'd we get

Ourselves into this?

BEHAN

You don't have to worry about a

Thing.  I just went down there and

Disarmed them.

VIRGIL

You did?  Great, thanks.  Come on, boys.

WYATT

Oh, great.  Disarmed my ass...

VIRGIL

We've come to arrest you.  Throw

Up your arms!

VIRGIL

Hold!  I don't want that!

WYATT

Oh, my God...

IKE

No, no, please!  I don't have a gun!

WYATT

This fight's commenced.  Get to

Fightin' or get away!

MORGAN

I'm hit.

WYATT

Behind us!

BEHAN

Come on!

FRANK

I got you now, you son of a bitch!

DOC

You're a daisy if you do!

BILLY

More cartridges!  Somebody load my gun...

BEHAN

All right.  You're all under

Arrest.

WYATT

I don't think I'll let you arrest

Us today, Behan.  Maybe tomorrow.

DOC

You call that shooting?

FLY

(comes up to Wyatt)

The McLaurys are both dead.  Billy

Clanton's just about gone.

WYATT

Guess we did our good deed for today.

WYATT

I'm sorry.  If there was any other-

CURLY BILL

I know.  Just did what you had to.

That banner and stuff, that's

Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.

CURLY BILL

Don't worry about a thing

WYATT

How you doin', boy?

MORGAN

Fine.  Better.

MORGAN

You were right.  It's nothin' like

I thought.  I almost wish...

WYATT

I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.

CURLY BILL

Here's to the memory of Billy

Clanton and Tom and Frank

McLaury.  They went out real

Cowboys, dead game right up to

Their last kick.  They won their

Places at the big table with Davy

Crockett and Wild Bill and Old

Man Clanton.  They're up there

Right now tradin' shots with 'em.

And they'll never be forgot.  Not

Ever.  Hundred years from now

There'll be men settin' around a

Campfire, passin' a bottle,

Tellin' stories about those boys.

They're what you call immortal.

And I say God bless 'em.

CURLY BILL

All right, first we hang back,

Just bide away till everybody

Thinks this's blown over.  Then...

WYATT

Mattie.  What about this?

MATTIE

(looks up, keeps ironing)

I need it.

WYATT

'Least you admit it.

MATTIE

Admit what, I'm an opium fiend?

No, Wyatt, I just said I need it.

I need something to keep me warm

At night.

WYATT

Look, Mattie, I know you're-

MATTIE

You know nothing.  What you don't

Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I

Feel like it's when you're around

I need it most.  You're never

Yourself, you never relax.  Never.

Everything's so stiff and dead.

You always have to keep a rein on

Everything, ever yourself.  Oh,

You smile sometimes, I've even

Seen you laugh.  But there's no

Light in your smile for me,

Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm.

And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.

(pauses)

What's between you and that Jew woman?

WYATT

All right, look.  I can make it

Right, I can make this up to you,

Mattie.  I can, I swear.

MATTIE

Will you go to her and tell her

Right in front of me she's

Nothing to you?  Right out loud so

I can hear?  Tell her she's

Nothing, tell her she's nobody,

Just dirt?  Will you do that?

MATTIE

Until you can do that we've got

Nothing to talk about, Wyatt.

Nothing.  Now leave me alone.

BEHAN

Listen, I want to talk to you.

JOSEPHINE

Not now.  I don't have time.

BEHAN

(grabs her)

I saw that look pass between you

And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to

Me!  You're mine!  Understand?

You're my woman and I'm your man.

JOSEPHINE

My man?  You told Wyatt you'd

Disarmed those men.  Do you

Actually believe after that I

Could see you as my man?  You're

Just a dirty little fixer.

BEHAN

You whore!  You filthy whore!

MORGAN

You don't talk that way to a

Female human being!  Not ever!

BEHAN

Look, I don't want to take

Advantage of an injured man but

You better-

CURLY BILL

So she's Wyatt's slice now.  Looks

Like we got another name for the

Tally book.

MORGAN

Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry

If I made a worse mess for you.

WYATT

I'm the one made a mess.  Made a

Right fair mess of the whole thing.

VIRGIL

Getting warmer.  Guess spring's comin'.

MORGAN

Hello, Billy.  I say hello, Deputy.

BREAKENRIDGE

(turns to them)

I don't want to talk to you.  Those

Men you killed were my friends.

I'm just a nothing, but if I

Wasn't I'd fight you, I'd fight

You right now.  So I don't wanna

Talk to you.

WYATT

All they ever did was make fun of him.

O.S. VOICE

Sister Boy should've stuck around.

VIRGIL

What d'you want, Ringo?

RINGO

I want your blood and I want you

Souls and I want them both right now.

WYATT

Don't want any more trouble, Ringo.

RINGO

(steps up to Wyatt)

Well you got trouble and it

Starts with you.

WYATT

I'm not gonna fight you, there's

No money in it.  Sober up.  Come

On, boys.

RINGO

Wretched slugs, don't any of you

Have the guts to play for blood?

O.S. VOICE

I'm your huckleberry.

DOC

That's just my game.

RINGO

All right, lunger.  Have at it.

DOC

On three?  You call it.

RINGO

Here it come: one-two-

CURLY BILL

Johnny, don't, Jesus!  Come on,

Son...

(turns to Earps)

Never mind.  He's drunk.

RINGO

I want them spitting blood!

CURLY BILL

Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.

(turns to others)

I tell you, boys, even I'm

Worried what'll happen once Ringo

Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!

RINGO

There's no God, there's no devil,

I hate the God damn world!  I want

To die!

CURLY BILL

Easy, son.  You just need to get

Your feet back under you, that's

All.  Come on, boy, let's kick

South.  Down to the old playground.

CURLY BILL

See son, there is a God after all!

VIRGIL

Gonna be one of those nights.

CURLY BILL

All right, boys.  Now's the time

To get woolly.

BEHAN

Easy.  I just wanted to tell you

Things're about to start changing

Around here.  Lots of so-called

Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger

Around this town but none of

'em's got a clue about the real

play.  None of 'em.

JOSEPHINE

I don't understand.

BEHAN

You will after tonight.  Bet on it.

ALLIE

God, it's a cold night.  Come up

To the fire, Mattie.

LOUISA

It looks like a woman.

JOSEPHINE

Please, I know it's awful me

Coming here, but listen, I can't

Say why, but I think something is-

ALLIE

Now who in... It's another woman.

JOSEPHINE

No!  Look out!

MAN'S VOICE

Everybody dies!

VIRGIL

Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.

WYATT

Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.

MORGAN

That thunder's sure somethin'.

WYATT

That didn't sound like thunder.

WYATT

Virgil?

VIRGIL

Wyatt...

VIRGIL

Wyatt!

DR. GOODFELLOW

I'm afraid your husband's been

Very badly hurt.  I had to remove

The entire left elbow joint.  What

That means is, well I'm afraid-

ALLIE

Oh, no, no, no, NO!

VIRGIL

No, no, don't worry, honey.  I

Still got one arm left to hug you with.

WYATT

It's all my fault.  If I hadn't been

So damn smart, if I'd just... Oh

God, Virge, I'm so sorry.

ALLIE

Look, Wyatt, I don't want to talk

Right now.

WYATT

Virgil, what am I going to do?

VIRGIL

For God's sake, just leave me alone.

ALLIE

He doesn't want to talk now.

MCMASTERS

No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin'

I say'll fix things but I want

You to know it wasn't me.

WYATT

No?  Brothers to the bone, right?

MCMASTERS

Not anymore, not after this.

MORGAN

Get down, boy.

WYATT

Morgan, are you crazy?  They're

Out gunning for us!  What the

Hell're you doin'?

MORGAN

What's it look like?  They want a

Piece of me they can come and get

It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.

WYATT

Morg, use your head.

MORGAN

I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been

Wonderin' how the hell we got in

This tangle.  You know they hit

Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife.

His wife.  Who ever heard of

That?  Men sneakin' around in the

Dark, back-shootin', scarin'

Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You

Know all your smart talk about

Live and let live?  Ain't no live

And let live with bugs.

WYATT

I know, I was wrong.  But Morg,

Look, we got to get out.

MORGAN

Listen to yourself, Wyatt.  Lie

Down and crawl or you might get

Hurt?  What kinda talk is that?

That's Virgil lyin' over there,

Wyatt.  Our own brother.  Ruined

For life.  No sir, I ain't going

No place.  You want to go, fine.

I'm stayin' right here and have

It out with those bastards.

MORGAN

How much you wanna bet?

WYATT

I just got it fixed.

MORGAN

You're on.

WYATT

No, no!  Get the doctor!  Jesus Christ!

DR. GOODFELLOW

Hold him.

WYATT

Oh, no, get her out of her!  Jesus!

DR. GOODFELLOW

I said hold him, God damn it!

WYATT

Somebody shut that dog up!

MORGAN

You were right, Wyatt.  They got

Me good.  Don't let 'em get you

Too.

WYATT

Will somebody get the damn dog out-

MORGAN

Remember about the light you're

Supposed to see when you're dyin'?

WYATT

Easy Morg, don't think about that now.

MORGAN

Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.

WYATT

Morgan?  Morgan!

WYATT

No, no, get away, get away from me...

JOSEPHINE

Wyatt...

WYATT

Whore!  Filthy whore!  Get away

From me!

DOC

Can't you see why he did it?

CURLY BILL

Naw, she's nobody.  Wyatt junked her.

DOC

And so she walked out of our

Lives forever.

WYATT

I want you to know it's over.

We're leaving and we're not

Coming back.

CURLY BILL

Well... 'bye.

RINGO

(sniffs)

Hey, you smell that?  Smells like

Something died.

CURLY BILL

(stifling a laugh)

Oh, Jesus, Johnny...

CURLY BILL

Take Frank and finish it.

STILLWELL

That's Virgil with the women.  But

Where the hell's Wyatt?

O.S. VOICE

Right behind you, Stillwell.

WAGONMASTER

Rest of us're 3 months out of

Independece but we're from

Carthage, Illinois originally.

WYATT

Carthage, really?  I'm from Monmouth.

WAGONMASTER

Another Illinois man!  Practical

Neighbors!  Step down, Marshal.

Have a feed.

WAGONMASTER

Ain't got law, ain't got nothin'.

Only thing between us and the

Animals.  Always the way it goes,

Though.  Only way to down an

Illinois man's from behind, the

Dogs don't dare face 'em.  Mr.

Lincoln, Wild Bill, now your

Brothers:  Illinois men all and

All downed from behind by dirty

Dogs and Democrats.  Guess an

Ordinary man'd be out for

Vengeance but I don't figure

That'll answer here.  It's a

Reckoning you're after.

WYATT

If the Lord is my friend.

WAGONMASTER

Let not your heart be faint, let

Your arm be steel-that's all you

Need of the Lord.

WYATT

Know why you're here?

VERMILLION

Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want

Us to help you get Ike Clanton

And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows

They're the ones to blame for

Your brothers.

WYATT

They're nothing.  They're nobody.

I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I

Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em

Out of the territory.

JOHNSON

Are you out of your mind?  What on

Earth'd make us-

WYATT

(takes out wad of bills)

I'll pay you 500 each in advance

And I'll mount you on those.

WYATT

Got a sheaf of federal warrants.

Being in the Territories it's up

To our discretion how they're

Served.  That means we got the

Cowboys without quarter.  The

Black flag, brother.  No

Prisoners, no mercy, amen.

VERMILLION

(to Johnson)

500... Year's wages.  And I never

even saw a horse like that.

JOHNSON

You crazy?  It can't be done.

MCMASTERS

It might be done.  If we hit the

Waterholes through the southern

Dragoons, the Whetstones and

Huachucas, we could take 'em on

In pieces, run off their herds.

(faces Wyatt)

Keep your money, I'll show you

Where those waterholes are.  Just

Promise me you'll finish it.  No

Matter what happens you'll see it

Through to the end.  I'll have

Your hand on that.

VERMILLION

We come through this in one

Piece, can we keep the horses?

JOHNSON

Crapped out.  Okay, we're in.

WYATT

The minute we start we'll be

Going against local and county

Law.  If we fail the U.S.

Government won't be able to lift

A finger to help us.  Nevertheless

I want you to understand we carry

The full force and authority of

The law of this land.

WYATT

Raise your right hands.  Do you

Solemnly swear to uphold the laws

And constitution of the United

States of America and to protect

her citizens to the best of your

Ability, even at the cost of your

Own life?

DOC

Oh... All right.

DOC

You know why I'm here.  My

Hypocrisy only goes so far.

LUCINDA

Wait!

LUCINDA

Your colors.

WAGONMASTER

Good luck, boys.  And give 'em hell!

LUCINDA'S SON

Wyatt Earp, the two-gun man,

Whistling death and bloody

Murder!  Wyatt the widow-maker,

Avenging and bright, purple

Poison on horseback with

Lightning in his eye and thunder

In his heart!  Wyatt and his he-

Devils, holy terrors and true,

Five black centaurs blowin' fire

And quicksilver!  Ride out and

Charge and shoot and strike and

Cleave and hack and thrust home!

Don't let up and give no rest and

Never call retreat till the last

One's smashed and smote and

Runnin' for cover.  Best 'em all

And break 'em up and bang their

Heads together in a bunch and

Give no quarter though they be

Ten times ten thousand!

ILLINOIS MOTHER

What're you doing?

ILLINOIS FATHER

Someday he'll be able to say he

Was there when Wyatt Earp rode

Out to bring the law.

WYATT

All right, let's wring 'em out!

JOHNSON

Like flyin', son.  Just like flyin'.

PONY DEAL

Maybe they smell a wolf.

(turns to other Cowboy)

Go up there and take a look.

PONY DEAL

Look!

BARNES

Look out!

WYATT

United States Marshals!  Reach!

DOC

Say something witty.

BARNES

Hey, you can't come-

WYATT

One more word and I'll blind you.

Get over there!

PONY DEAL

(to McMasters)

Hey brother, what're you doin'-

MCMASTERS

I ain't your brother, I ain't

None of your damn brothers.  Move!

WYATT

All right, run 'em off.

SWILLING

Bastard!  Stinkin' bastard!  Like

To eat you blood raw!

WYATT

All right, breed.  Dig in.

DOC

It appears he missed an excellent

Chance to keep his mouth shut.

WYATT

(faces Cowboys)

Felt his liver go on that last

One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll

Be dead in a couple hours.

MCMASTERS

Florentino!  He's getting away!

WYATT

Drop his horse.

FLORENTINO

I don't kill your brother!  I

Don't even know him.  I was only

Lookout.  It was money, they give

Me twelve dollars!  It was money!

WYATT

A human life.  Twelve dollars.

FLORENTINO

No!

WYATT

Look at him.  That's how you'll

All end up if you don't get it

Through your head: it's over,

The Cowboys're finished.  Forever.

So tell the others and get out of

The Territory 'cause next time I

Leave no one alive.  Understand?

No one.  You been warned.

(to his men)

All right, burn it!  Everything!

WYATT

Leave that trash where it lays.

VERMILLION

You know, we might just pull this off.

JOHNSON

Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me

It gets harder from here in.

(pauses)

Should've held out for more money.

WYATT

I know that cut.  You mean there's

A waterhole near there?

MCMASTERS

But this time they'll be ready.

WYATT

We'll see about that.

PONY DEAL

Keep your eyes open for Earp's

Bunch.  Swear to God, ain't gonna

Get the drop on us this time.

1ST COWBOY

Riders up ahead!  ...four, five.

It's them all right!

DOC

They saw us.  Here they come.

WYATT

Wait... wait... steady...

WYATT

Now!

WYATT

Lay on!

PONY DEAL

Run!

WYATT

Come on!

MCMASTERS

What'd you do that for?

WYATT

So he can tell the story.

1ST COWBOY

Didn't make any sense.  One minute

We're chasin' 'em, next they're

Right on top of us.  We couldn't

Stop 'em, they got everybody.

Just everybody!

CURLY BILL

Easy now, it's only five men.

Been havin' it their way 'cause

They been surprising you.  Hittin'

The waterholes and that Judas

McMasters is showin' 'em right

Where they are.  Pretty damn cute.

But nobody's cute as me.

(points to dirt map)

Next up's Black Draw.  But that

Smart Wyatt'll say no, that's

Where they'll expect us to hit,

We'll hit the one after.  Iron

Springs.  That's where they show

Next.  Only I'm gonna be there

First.  And throw a little party.

DOC

Don't touch me!

VERMILLION

Sorry...

VERMILLION

You really look awful.

DOC

Not half as bad as I feel.

VERMILLION

Then why in hell're you doin'

This?  You ought to be in bed.

DOC

Wyatt Earp is my friend.

VERMILLION

Hell, I got lot's of friends.

DOC

(turns, glares at him)

I don't.

JOHNSON

Maybe you ought to have a talk

With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if

He's gonna make it.

WYATT

There's no reasoning with him.

MCMASTERS

(points to map)

Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We

Could be there by mid-morning.

WYATT

They're wise by now.  Which is

Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's

Try there, Iron Springs.

MCMASTERS

There they are.  No herd though.

WYATT

We'll go around that way, come up on foot.

MCMASTERS

Ambush!  Get down!

JOHNSON

Christ!

CURLY BILL

Hey, Wyatt!  How the hell are you?

DOC

Look!

CURLY BILL

Got some boys workin' around

Those rocks behind you.  Another

Minute or two, gonna have you in

A crossfire!  How do you like that?

MCMASTERS

He's right.  They get set up in

Them rocks it's the end for us.

CURLY BILL

'Course you could give yourselves

up and we could have a party!

Then what larks!

VERMILLION

Ain't takin' me alive, damn it!

MCMASTERS

Think of somethin' fast or we're cooked.

WYATT

No.

JOHNSON

What?

WYATT

No.

DOC

Wyatt!

WYATT

No...

CURLY BILL

Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get

Some, boy!

WYATT

No...

CURLY BILL

Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you

Bastard...

WYATT

No...

CURLY BILL

Die!  Son of a bitch!  Die!

WYATT

No!

BARNES

Jesus Christ!

WYATT

No!

DOC

Come on!

WYATT

No...

DOC

Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!

WYATT

No...

VERMILLION

Yeah, better run, you bastards!

JOHNSON

(turn to Doc)

How is he?

DOC

(looks up, amazed)

I don't believe it.  He's clean!

VERMILLION

What?  But I saw 'em-

DOC

I'm telling you, there isn't a

Mark on him.

DOC

I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I

Literally don't care if I live or

Die.  But even I can't fight human

Instinct.  Somebody suddenly

Starts shooting at me, I duck.

But you... what on earth were

You thinking about?

WYATT

I don't know.  It all happened so

Fast.  If I'd had a chance to

Think about it I guess I probably

Would've been scared but... Swear

To God, Doc, I just don't know.

VERMILLION

Hey Creek, you ever see anything

Like that before?

JOHNSON

Never even heard of anything like it.

VERMILLION

I just thought of somethin' I

Never thought about before.

(pauses, looks at him)

I don't want to go to hell.

VERMILLION

Talked it over.  We decided we

Don't need the money.  Took out 13

Dollars each, though.  Federal

Posseman's fee.  That all right?

WYATT

Sure...

JOHNSON

One thing.  We come through this

Alive, can we keep the badges?

MCMASTERS

Where's Wyatt?

DOC

Down at the creek.  Walking on water.

1ST COWBOY

We hit him half a dozen times but

He just kept comin', walked right

Up to Curly Bill with that 10

Gauge and blew him up!

RINGO

Curly Bill?  He killed Curly Bill?

2ND COWBOY

He didn't just kill him, he

Burned him down!  Blew him in

Half!  I mean all the way in half,

Like a melon!  Then he turned

Around with that big Colt and

Killed Johnny Barnes, shot up a

Couple more 'fore we got out of

there.  But it was his face, you

should've seen his face.

RINGO

He's just a man.

1ST COWBOY

You didn't see his face

RINGO

You see my face, don't you?

RINGO

Everybody get this through their

Heads.  Wyatt Earp dies.  I'm

Running the show now and I'm

Telling you, Earp dies.  His men

Too.  They all die.  Understand?

We're gonna kill 'em.  For what

They did to Curly Bill we're

Gonna ride 'em into the ground

And slaughter 'em like rabbits.

'Cause this is my time, children.

This is where I get woolly.

GROUNDS

What d'you think?  I didn't think

Curly Bill could be killed.  I'm

Tellin' you, this whole thing's

Gone sour.  We got hands droppin'

Like flies and Ringo's flat out

Of his mind.  I mean, hell

Brother, you feel like ridin'

Against Wyatt Earp?

HUNT

Hell no, brother.

GROUNDS

Then brother let's you and me cut out.

HUNT

Right with you, brother.

BEHAN

Are you crazy?  It's front page

News all over the country.  It's

Getting out of hand, Ringo.  If

Things don't settle down soon-

RINGO

You heard me, Behan.

BEHAN

Ringo, you don't understand-

RINGO

No, you don't understand.

3RD COWBOY

Billy Grounds and Zwing Hunt ran

Out.  Four, five others, too.

RINGO

Who cares?  Separate the wheat

From the chaff.

BEHAN

What're you doing here, Billy?

BREAKENRIDGE

Curly Bill was my friend.  I'd

Like to come with you.

RINGO

Sure, why not?

RINGO

I told you it was time to get

Woolly.  Now gather 'round,

Children, gather 'round.  And

Raise your right hands.

MCMASTERS

That's Ringo out front.  And

There's Behan.  Must be 30 of 'em.

What the hell... they're wearin'

Badges.

WYATT

Mounts're getting jaded.  We're

Gonna have to find a place to

Rest 'em up.

WYATT

Doc...

DOC

Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just

Don't touch me!  Come on...

WYATT

Grab him.

WYATT

Horse're pretty well fagged and

We got a sick man with us.

HOOKER

You can put up at my ranch if you want.

HOOKER

I'm no doctor but he looks pretty bad.

HUNT

What's it gonna be, brother?

GROUNDS

I don't care.  Colorado, New

Mexico, 'long as we're out of the

Territory.

HUNT

Just what we need.  Travelin' money.

BEHAN

Robbery.  2 men stuck 'em up and

Killed a passenger.  One of 'em

Rode a Mexican saddle, the other

Had a Mother Hubbard.  Billy

Grounds and Zwing Hunt.

BREAKENRIDGE

Oh, no...

JOSEPHINE

We're headed for a booking in

Denver.  They tried to take my

Watch.  He cursed them for cowards

And they shot him.  He may've been

Vain and an actor but he was

Better than all of you.  And

Gentler and braver.  I don't

Understand any of this, I only

Know it's ugly.  You're all ugly

And he was beautiful, he tried to

Put something fine into your ugly

World and you killed him for it.

Anyway the ones who did it are

headed north.  Not that you care.

BEHAN

Where're you going?  Get back here!

BILLY

I'm sorry, sir, but we got to

Have some law.

RINGO

Let him go.  Who cares?

HOOKER

Had a holdup.  Came her to water

Their horses before pushin' on.

WYATT

Sorry about your friend.

(pauses)

And I'm sorry about...

JOSEPHINE

I forgave you the moment you said it.

WYATT

You did.  Well... thank you.

JOSEPHINE

I have to go.

WYATT

Wait!

WYATT

Goodbye.

WYATT

Damn... Damn!

WYATT

See how she breezed out of here.

Like she had wings.  Funny thing

But I can't really remember how

She looked.  I can remember parts

Of her clear as crystal, her

Mouth, her walk, how she shut her

Eyes when she laughed, little

Bits and pieces, but not the

Whole package.  Can't put it

Together for some reason.

JOHNSON

Good God, you're really-

WYATT

Cards in spades.  I'm in love with

Every second of her life.  Hell,

I'll probably love her when I'm dust.

HUNT

No fire tonight, son.  Too many

Riders out.

HUNT

Who's that?

BREAKENRIDGE

It's Deputy Breakenridge.

HUNT

Sister Boy!  Thank God, we was afraid-

BREAKENRIDGE

You shouldn't've killed Mr.

Fabian.  You shouldn't've done

That.  It was wrong.  I'm takin'

You both in for it.

HUNT

What?  You gotta be kiddin'.  Look,

Just go home 'fore you get hurt.

BREAKENRIDGE

Don't want to kill you but I will

If I have to.  I'm warning you.

GROUNDS

No, I'm warning you, Sister Boy!

BREAKENRIDGE

Don't try it!

GROUNDS

Sister Boy, just go to hell!

BREAKENRIDGE

Sorry.

HOOKER

...brought 'em in draped over

their saddles.  Little Billy

Breakenridge.  Sister Boy.  He done

It.  So I guess the law's finally

Arrived in southeast Arizona.

RINGO

Hooker's got around 15 or 16

Hands.  We could take 'em right

Enough but it might be a mess.

Keep the place bottled up for

Now, see if we can figure a way

To flush 'em.

BEHAN

It's too much!  It's completely

Out of hand!  Governor Gosper's

Talking about asking the

President to send in the Army!

Listen Ringo, you've got to get

This over with and you've got to

Do it now.  One way or another.

WYATT

We should get moving.

VERMILLION

Doc's just in no kinda shape.

HOOKER

Don't have to bother about that.

Took a vote.  Cowboys or not, you

Can stay here as long as you want.

Anyway maybe you done enough.  I

Mean you whittled 'em down

Considerable, now there's talk of

Sendin' the Army in here.  Ask me,

You done enough.

RANCH HAND

(rides up, points)

Rider comin' in under a white flag

3RD COWBOY

Got a message.  Ringo wants

McMaster to come over to our

Camp for a parley.

MCMASTERS

He didn't figure on all the stink

This is causin'.  Might be he's

lookin' to strike a bargain.  If

So, he probably figures he needs

Somebody like me who talks his

Language.  Could be we got him.

WYATT

I don't like it.

MCMASTERS

Might as well hear him out.

Anyways, what choice we got?

(Mounts horse, whispers)

But no matter what happens, see

It through to the end.  If you

don't I'll curse the day I ever

laid eyes on you.

RINGO

Well hello, Sherm.

MCMASTERS

You wanted to talk?

RINGO

Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if

you'd join back up with us.

MCMASTERS

That what you got me up here for?

RINGO

You're a Cowboy, you're a

Brother.  Come back, no hard

Feelings.

MCMASTERS

Forget it, Ringo.

RINGO

Isn't there anything I can say

That'll change your mind?  You're

Gonna stay with your new friends?

MCMASTERS

'Least they don't scare women.

RINGO

You're the boss.  One thing, though.

RINGO

How you gonna get back to 'em?

VERMILLION

Why couldn't they've jus killed him?

3RD COWBOY

(shouts)

Ringo wanted to be sure he got

Your attention, Marshal.  He wants

A straight-up fight, just you and

Him, settle this thing once and

For all.  You win, we quit the

Territory; Ringo wins, your

Deputies get safe conduct to the

Colorado line.  Sundown today in

The oak grove at the mouth of

Sulphur Springs Canyon.  Ride out

With your escort, we'll meet you.

WYATT

You tell Ringo... just tell him

I'll be there.

JOHNSON

Wyatt, are you crazy?

WYATT

I made a promise.

VERMILLION

Wyatt, listen, you can't beat

Him.  You're good and God knows

You got the courage, but you

Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell,

He's the best that's ever been.

'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.

JOHNSON

He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could

Put five into you before you

Could even get one into him.

WYATT

But I'd do it, I'd get that one

Into him.  So help me God, I would.

JOHNSON

All right Wyatt, maybe you can.

But you gotta die to do it.

Understand?  You gotta die!

WYATT

What makes a man like Ringo, Doc?

What makes him do the things he does?

DOC

A man like Ringo's got a great

Empty hole right through the

Middle of him and no matter what

He does he can't ever fill it.  He

Can't kill enough or steal enough

Or inflict enough pain to ever

Fill it.  And it drives him mad.

Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.

WYATT

So what does he want?

DOC

What does he want?  He wants revenge.

WYATT

Revenge?  For what?

DOC

Being born.

WYATT

Remember how I said it all

Happened so fast with Curly Bill

I didn't have time to think about it?

Well I've had plenty of time

To think about this.  I spent most

Of my life since I was born not

Knowing what I want out of life,

Just chasin' my tail.  But now,

For the first time I know exactly

What I want.  And who.  And that's

The damnable misery of it.

(pauses, looks at Doc)

I can't beat him, can I?

DOC

No, wait, I'll go with you...

DOC

I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God,

I'm so sorry.

WYATT

That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.

DOC

Never got to wear one of those.

HOOKER

Don't worry.  They want him

They'll have to go over us first.

RINGO

Only three.  They left somebody

Behind.  Let's go take a look.

HOOKER

What're you doin' here?

RINGO

Who's in there?

HOOKER

It's Holliday.  He's sick.  Imagine

He's dyin'.

RINGO

Drag him out here, let's have a look.

HOOKER

I looked the other way when you

Did a lot of foul things but I

Ain't lettin' you torment a dyin'

Man.  Not as long as he's under my

Roof.  I draw the line there.

RINGO

All right, Hooker.  I'll be back

In about an hour.  We'll see how

Brave you are then.

HOOKER

I'll be here.

RINGO

Soon as I'm through with Wyatt,

Swarm down with the whole bunch

And finish off Creek Johnson and

Texas Jack.

3RD COWBOY

He's waitin' for you by the big

Oak, quarter mile up that trail.

IKE

Get ready.  Soon as Ringo's done

We're gonna take care of the others.

BEHAN

Aren't we giving them safe conduct?

IKE

Sure we are.  All the way to hell.

WYATT

They're not givin' you any safe

Conduct.  Soon as the shooting

Starts kick east for the New

Mexico line.  Well...

JOHNSON

Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.

WYATT

I know.  Me neither.

WYATT

Dear God, this is the last

Battle.  I worked it out in my

Head every which way and I know

There's no way I'm comin' through

This alive.  You've preserved me

This far so I only ask one more

Favor: just let me live long

Enough to kill that man.  Thy will

Be done and there's an amen to it.

RINGO

Well, didn't think you had it in you.

(smiles, sets himself)

Shall we?

DARK SILHOUETTE

I'm your huckleberry.

DOC

Why Johnny Ringo, you look like

Somebody just walked over your grave.

(sees his shock)

Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I

Made out.

RINGO

My fight's not with you, Holliday.

DOC

I beg to differ.  We started a

Fight we never got to finish.

Play for blood, remember?

RINGO

I was kidding about that.

DOC

I wasn't.

(pins on Wyatt's badge)

And this time it's legal.

RINGO

All right, lunger.  Let's do it.

DOC

Say when.

DOC

Come on!  Come on!

DOC

Oh Johnny.  You're no daisy, no

Daisy at all.

WYATT

What happened?

DOC

Poor soul, he was so high-strung.

Afraid the strain was more than

He could bear.

DOC

Let's go!  My horse is over here.

VERMILLION

Praise Jesus!

JOHNSON

I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.

IKE

All right, get ready...

WYATT

All right, what's it to be?  New

Mexico's that way.

JOHNSON

Colorado's closer

WYATT

So're the Cowboys.  They're up

That road right now, waiting to

Jump us.

VERMILLION

We're the law, ain't we?  Well the

Law don't ride around vermin-

JOHNSON

It rides right at 'em.  Like

McMasters said, see it through to

The end.

DOC

I just wanted to see what it felt

Like.  Here...

4TH COWBOY

Riders comin'.

BEHAN

Well I guess Ringo did it.

3RD COWBOY

Ringo's dead

BEHAN

What?

4TH COWBOY

That's Wyatt Earp's bunch!

3RD COWBOY

They're comin' right at us!

4TH COWBOY

Here they come!  Get ready...

BEHAN

Oh, no...

4TH COWBOY

What d'you think?

3RD COWBOY

I think it's time to start

Workin' for a livin'.

BEHAN

Me too!

IKE

Kill 'em!  Kill 'em!  It's only

Four men!  Why don't you kill 'em?

4TH COWBOY

Why don't you?

DOC

Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want

You to meet Father Feeney.  Father

Feeney's just been initiating me

Into the mysteries of the great

And ancient Church of Rome.  You

See, it appears my hypocrisy

Knows no bounds.

WYATT

How you feelin', Doc?

DOC

Rather an obvious question under

The circumstances, don't you

Agree?  A better one might be how

Do you feel?

WYATT

(sits down, sighs)

Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.

DOC

I imagine it would, yes.  So now

We can add self-pity to your list

Of frailties.

WYATT

All right, Doc...

DOC

You think I'm kidding.  You're the

Most fallible, wrong-headed, self-

Deluding, just generally

Benighted jackass I've ever

Known.  Yet, withal, even at your

Worst, you're the only human

Being in my entire life who ever

Gave me hope.

WYATT

All I ever wanted was to live a

Normal life.

DOC

When will you wake up?  You

Wouldn't know a normal life if it

Bit you in the ass.

WYATT

That's great coming from you.

DOC

I played the cards I was dealt,

Wyatt.  Your problem is you're

Always trying to play someone

Else's.  Allow me to tell you the

Truth and thus set you free:

There is no happiness, Wyatt

There is no normal life.  There's

Only life, that's all.  Just life.

The rest is relative.

WYATT

Then what do I do?

DOC

First you can grab that black-

Haired woman and make her your own.

WYATT

All right.  Then what?

DOC

Run.  Take that girl and start

Running.  Run and don't look back.

All your life you been running

And looking back and just barely

Existing and calling it getting

By.  This time run and don't look

Back and call it living.  Live

Every second, live it right up to

The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...

(pauses, takes his hand)

Live for me.

DOC

Wyatt, please, if you were ever

My friend, if you ever had even

The smallest feeling for me,

Leave.  Leave now.  Please.

DOC

Never mind, Wyatt.  I know.  Just go.

DOC

Now let's see, Father.  What was

That monkey show you were talking about?

FATHER FEENEY

You mean Extreme Unction?

DOC

That's it.  Better start that ball rolling.

DOC

I'll be damned...

(looks at Feeney)

This is funny.

1ST ACTRESS

I can't get used to this thin air

Here in Denver.  I thought I was

Going to faint on that last buck-

And-wing.

JOSEPHINE

I know, it's-

JOSEPHINE

Wyatt!  My God...

WYATT

Did you ever see the sun come up

Over the Rockies?  It hits all of

A sudden and below there's

California and you swear you're

Looking at heaven.

WYATT

I have nothing left.  I have

Nothing to give you.  I have no

Pride, no dignity, no money.  I

Don't even know how we'll make a

Living.  But I promise I'll love

You every second of your life.

JOSEPHINE

Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.

1ST REPORTER

Mr Earp!  One minute, please!  You

And your four men have just

Accomplished in one week what it

Took the Texas Rangers four years

To do.  Please, do you have any comment?

WYATT

There.  It'll come up over that ridge.

1ST REPORTER

Don't you know?  That's Wyatt

Earp, the Lion of Tombstone, and

His lady fair.

WYATT

Get ready, here it comes!  Here it comes!

FADE OUT:

Flush, in 47 years they never

Left each other's side."
