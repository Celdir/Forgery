FADE IN

VOICE

January, 1961 - President Dwight D.

Eisenhower's Farewell Address to the

Nation -

EISENHOWER

The conjunction of an immense military

establishment and a large arms

industry is new in the American

experience.  The total influence -

economic, political, even spiritual -

is felt in every city, every

statehouse, every office of the

Federal Government... In the councils

of government we must guard against

the acquisition of unwarranted

influence, whether sought or unsought,

by the military industrial complex.

The potential for the disastrous

rise of misplaced power exists and

will persist... We must never let

the weight of this combination

endanger our liberties or democratic

processes.  We should take nothing

for granted...

VOICE 2

November, 1960 - Senator John F.

Kennedy of Massachusetts wins one of

the narrowest election victories in

American history over the Vice-

President Richard Nixon by a little

more than 100,000 votes.  Rumors

abound that he stole the election in

Illinois through the Democratic

political machine of Mayor Daley...

(inauguration shots)

At his inauguration, at a time when

American males all wore hats, he let

his hair blow free in the wind.

Alongside his beautiful and elegant

wife of French origin, Jacqueline

Bouvier, J.F.K. is the symbol of the

new freedom of the 1960's, signifying

change and upheaval to the American

public, scaring many and hated

passionately by some.  To win the

election and to appease their fears,

Kennedy at first takes a tough Cold

War stance.

VOICE 3

He inherits a secret war against the

Communist Castro dictatorship in

Cuba, a war run by the CIA and angry

Cuban exiles out of bases in the

Southern United States, Panama,

Nicaragua and Guatemala.  Castro is

a successful revolutionary frightening

to American business interests in

Latin America - companies like Cabot's

United Fruit, Continental Can, and

Rockefeller's Standard Oil.  This

war culminates in the disastrous Bay

of Pigs invasion in April 1961, when

Kennedy refuses to provide air cover

for the exile brigade.  Of the 1600

men who invade, 114 are killed, 1200

are captured.  The Cuban exiles and

the CIA are furious at Kennedy's

irresolution... Kennedy, taking public

responsibility for the failure,

privately claims the CIA lied to him

and tried to manipulate him into

ordering an all-out American invasion

of Cuba.  He vows to splinter the

CIA into a thousand pieces and fires

Director Allen Dulles, Deputies

Charles Cabell and Richard Bissell,

the top leadership of the Agency.

VOICE 4

The CIA, however, continues it's

secret war on Castro with dozens of

sabotage and assassination attempts

under it's ZR/RIFLE and MONGOOSE

programs - The Agency collaborates

with organized crime elements such

as John Roselli, Sam Giancana, and

Santos Trafficante of Tampa, whose

casino operations in Cuba, worth

more than a hundred million dollars

a year in income, Castro has shut

down.

VOICE 5

In October 1962, the world comes to

the brink of nuclear war when Kennedy

quarantines Cuba after announcing

the presence of offensive Soviet

nuclear missiles 90 miles off American

shores.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff

and the CIA call for an invasion.

Kennedy refuses.  Soviet ships with

more missiles sail towards the island,

but at the last moment turn back.

The world breathes with relief but

backstage in Washington, rumors abound

that J.F.K. has cut a secret deal

with Russian Premier Khrushchev not

to invade Cuba in return for a Russian

withdrawal of missiles.  Suspicions

abound that Kennedy is "soft on

Communism."

VOICE 6

In the ensuing months, Kennedy clamps

down on Cuban exile activities,

closing training camps, restricting

covert operations, prohibiting

shipment of weapons out of the

country.  The covert arm of the CIA

nevertheless continues its plan to

assassinate Castor... In March '63,

Kennedy announces drastic cuts in

the defense budget.  In November

1963, he orders the withdrawal by

Christmas of the first 1000 troops

of the 16,000 stationed in Vietnam.

He tells several of his intimates

that he will withdraw all Vietnam

troops after the '64 election, saying

to the Assistant Secretary of State,

Roger Hilsman, "The Bay of Pigs has

taught me one, not to trust generals

or the CIA, and two, that if the

American people do not want to use

American troops to remove a Communist

regime 90 miles from our coast, how

can I ask them to use troops to remove

a Communist regime 9,000 miles

away?"... Finally, in August 1963,

over the objections of the Joint

Chiefs of Staff, the United States,

Great Britain and the Soviet Union

sign a treaty banning nuclear bomb

tests in the atmosphere, underwater

and in space...  Early that fateful

summer, Kennedy speaks of his new

vision at American University in

Washington.

JFK

What kind of peace do we seek?  Not

a pax Americana enforced on the world

by American weapons of war... We

must re-examine our own attitudes

towards the Soviet Union... If we

cannot now end our differences at

least we can help make the world

safe for diversity.  For, in the

final analysis, our most basic link

is that we all inhabit this small

planet.  We all breathe the same

air.  We all cherish our children's

future.  And we are all mortal...

ROSE

They're going up to Dallas... to

whack Kennedy.  Friday the 22nd,

that's when they're going to do it.

In Dealey Plaza.  They're gonna whack

him!  You gotta call somebody, these

are serious fuckin' guys.

DOCTOR

(to the police officer)

Higher'n a kite on something.  Been

like this since she came in.

VOICE 7

More rumors emerge of J.F.K.'s

backdoor efforts outside usual State

Department and CIA channels to

establish dialogue with Fidel Castro

through contacts at the United Nations

in New York.  Kennedy is seeking

change on all fronts.  Bitter battles

are fought with Southern

segregationists to get James Meredith

into the University of Mississippi.

Three months after Kennedy submits a

sweeping civil rights bill to

Congress, Martin Luther King leads

250,000 in a march on Washington.

Robert Kennedy, as Attorney General,

for the first time ever vigorously

prosecutes the Mafia in American

life, bringing and winning a record

number of cases - 288 convictions of

organized crime figures including 13

grand juries against Jimmy Hoffa and

his Teamsters Union.  The President

also takes on Big Business, forcing

back steel prices, winning 45 of 46

antitrust cases during 1963 and he

wants to help everyday taxpayers by

ending age- old business privileges

like the oil depletion allowance and

the fees paid to the Federal Reserve

Bank for printing America's currency.

Revolutionary changes are foreseen

after J.F.K.'s assumed re-election

in 1964.  Foremost in the political

consciousness of the country is the

possibility of a Kennedy dynasty.

Robert Kennedy in '68, Teddy Kennedy

in '76.  In November, 1963 John

Kennedy travels to Texas, his

popularity sagging to 59% largely

due to his civil rights stand for

which he is particularly hated in

the South.  Texas is a crucial state

for him to carry in '64.  With him

is Vice-President, Lyndon Johnson

and Texas Governor John Connally.

On November 21, they visit Houston

and San Antonio.  On the morning of

November 22, he speaks in Fort Worth,

then flies 15 minutes to Love Field

in Dallas, where he takes a motorcade

through downtown Dallas on his way

to speak at 12:30 at the International

Trade Mart.  Later, the motorcade

takes him through Dealey Plaza at

12:30...

AMBULANCE VOICE

We are en route to Parkland.

VOICE

We'll be there in about five minutes.

JACKIE KENNEDY

(voice restaged)

And in the motorcade, you know I

usually would be waving mostly to

the left side and he was waving mostly

to the right, which is one reason

you're not looking at each other

very much.  And it was terribly hot.

Just blinding all of us... We could

see a tunnel in front of us.

Everything was really slow then.

And I remember thinking it would be

so cool under that tunnel.

MRS. CONNALLY (V.O.)

Mr. President, you can't say that

Dallas doesn't love you.

JFK (V.O.)

No, you certainly can't.

CBS BULLETIN

(full screen)

We interrupt this program to bring

you this flash bulletin.  A burst of

gunfire!  Three bursts of gunfire,

apparently from automatic weapons,

were fired at President Kennedy's

motorcade in downtown Dallas.

VOICES

OH NO!  MY GOD THEY'RE GOING TO KILL

US ALL!  Be still.  You're going to

be all right.  LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

WE'RE HIT!  LAWSON, THIS IS KELLERMAN.

WE ARE HIT.  GET US TO THE HOSPITAL

IMMEDIATELY.  PULL OUT OF THE

MOTORCADE.  TAKE US TO THE NEAREST

HOSPITAL.

JACKIE KENNEDY VOICE

Oh, no, they've shot Jack... I love

you, Jack... Jack... they've killed

my husband...

CBS BULLETIN (V.O.)

The first reports say that President

Kennedy has been seriously wounded

by the shooting.  More details just

arrived.  United Press say the wounds

to President Kennedy perhaps could

be fatal.  Repeating: President

Kennedy has been shot by a would-be

assassin in Dallas.  Three bursts of

gunfire, apparently from automatic

weapons...

VOICES

(blending under)

IT CAME FROM THERE.  SECURE THAT

AREA BEHIND THE FENCE.  IT'S THAT

BUILDING UP THERE.

JIM

What's wrong, Lou?

LOU

Boss, the President's been shot.  In

Dallas.  Five minutes ago.

JIM

Oh no!... How bad?

LOU

No word yet.  But they think it's in

the head.

JIM

Come on.  Napoleon's has a TV set.

NEWSMAN 1

Apparently three bullets were found.

Governor Connally also appeared to

be hit.  The President was rushed by

the Secret Service to Parkland

Memorial Hospital four miles from

Dealey Plaza.

JIM

There's still a chance, dammit!

Come on, Jack - pull through.

MANAGER

(Italian, distracted)

I don't believe it.  I don't believe

it.  Here, in this country.

WALTER CRONKITE

From Dallas, Texas - the flash

apparently official, President Kennedy

died at 1 p.m.  Central Standard

Time, 2 o'clock Eastern Standard

Time, some 38 minutes ago.

(choked pause)

Vice-President Johnson has left the

hospital in Dallas, but we do not

know to where he has proceeded.

Presumably, he will be taking the

oath of office shortly, and become

the 36th President of the United

States.

JIM

I didn't always agree with him - too

liberal for my tastes - but I

respected him.  He had style... God,

I'm ashamed to be an American today.

NEWSMAN 2

Many arrests have been made here

today.  Anyone looking even remotely

suspicious is being detained.  Most

of the crowd has gone home but there

are still many stunned people

wandering around in Dealey Plaza

unable to comprehend what happened

here earlier today.

BLACK WOMAN

(crying)

It's all so terrible.  I jes' can't

stop crying.  He did so much for

this country, for colored people.

Why?

MAN

(Bill Newman, with

wife and kids)

I grabbed my kids and wife and hit

the ground.  The bullets were coming

over our heads - from that fence

back on the knoll - I was just so

shaken.  I saw his face when it hit...

he just, his ear flew off, he turned

just real white and then went stiff

like a board and flopped over on his

stomach, with his foot sticking out.

WOMAN 2

I thought... it came from up there,

that building.

MAN 2

I heard shots from over there.

NEWSMAN 2

How many shots?

WOMAN 3

About 3 to 4... I don't know.

MAN 3

I never thought it could happen in

America.

BANISTER

All this blubbering over that

sonofabitch!  They're grieving like

they knew the man.  It makes me want

to puke.

MARTIN

God's sake, chief.  The President

was shot.

BANISTER

A bullshit President!  I don't see

any weeping for all the thousands of

Cubans that bastard condemned to

death and torture at the Bay of Pigs.

Where are all the tears for the

Russians and Hungarians and Chinese

living like slaves in prison camps

run by Kennedy's communist buddies -

All these damned peace treaties!

I'm telling ya Jack, that's what

happens when you let the niggers

vote.  They get together with the

Jews and the Catholics and elect an

Irish bleeding heart.

MARTIN

Chief, maybe you had a little too

much to drink.

BANISTER

Bullshit!

(yells across the

room)

Bartender, another round...

(finishes drink)

Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot

in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.

NEWSMAN 3

This is the rifle, it is a Mannlicher -

Carcano Italian rifle, a powerful

World War II military gun used by

infantry and highly accurate at

distances of 100 yards.

NEWSMAN 3

The assassin apparently fired from

this perch... but so far no word,

much confusion and...

NEWSMAN 4

A flash bulletin... the Dallas Police

have just announced they have a

suspect in the killing of a Dallas

police officer, J.D. Tippit, who was

shot at 1:15 in Oak Cliff, a suburb

of Dallas.

NEWSMAN 4

The suspect, identified as Lee Harvey

Oswald, was arrested by more than a

dozen police officers after a short

scuffle at the Texas movie theatre

in Oak Cliff, several blocks from

where Officer Tippit was killed,

apparently with a .38 revolver found

on Oswald.  There is apparently at

least one eyewitness.

TV OSWALD

No, I don't know what I'm charged

with... I don't know what dispatches

you people have been given, but I

emphatically deny these charges.

VOICE FROM THE BAR

They oughta just shoot the bastard.

LOU

One little guy with a cheap rifle -

look what he can do.

JIM

Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw

too much stuff like this in the war.

BANISTER

Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?

(Martin says nothing,

looks troubled)

I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just

did this crazy thing before anyone

could stop him, right?

MARTIN

I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I

gotta get home.

BANISTER

(strong-arms Martin)

Get home my ass.  We're going to the

office, have another drink.  I want

some company tonight.

BANISTER

(repetitive)

Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald

kid would pull off a stunt like an

assassination?

(Martin waits)

Just goes to show, you can never

know about some people.  Am I right,

Jack?

(Martin, frightened

now, doesn't reply)

Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are

as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't

tell me we have another bleeding

heart here.  Hell, all these years I

thought you were on my side.

MARTIN

Chief, sometimes I don't know whether

you're kidding or not.

BANISTER

I couldn't be more serious, Jack.

Those big red eyes have me wondering

about your loyalty.

BANISTER

Who the hell opened my files!  You've

been looking through my private files,

haven't you, you weasel?

MARTIN

You may not like this, chief, but

you're beginning to act paranoid.  I

mean, you really are.

BANISTER

You found out about Dave Ferrie going

to Texas today and you went through

all my files to see what was going

on.  You're a goddamn spy.

MARTIN

(angry)

Goddammit chief, why would I ever

need to look in your files?  I saw

enough here this summer to write a

book.

BANISTER

I always lock my files.  And you

were the only one here today...

(stops as he hears

Martin)

What do you mean, you son of a bitch?

MARTIN

You know what I mean.  I saw a lot

of strange things going on in this

office this summer.  And a lotta

strange people.

BANISTER

You didn't see a goddamn thing, you

little weasel.  Do you get it?  You

didn't see a goddamn thing.

NEWSMAN 5

(over the din)

Did you shoot the President?

TV OSWALD

I didn't shoot anybody, no sir.  I'm

just a patsy.

LIZ

My god, he sure looks like a creep.

What's he talkin' 'bout... a patsy?

TV OSWALD

Well, I was questioned by a judge.

However, I protested at the time

that I was not allowed legal

representation during that very short

and sweet hearing.  Uh, I really

don't know what the situation is

about.  Nobody has told me anything

except that I am accused of, uh,

murdering a policeman.  I know nothing

more than that and I do request that

someone come forward to give me, uh,

legal assistance.

NEWSMAN 5

Did you kill the President?

TV OSWALD

No.  I have not been charged with

that.  In fact nobody has said that

to me yet.  The first thing I heard

about it was when the newspaper

reporters in the hall, uh, asked me

that question.

NEWSMAN 6

You have been charged.

TV OSWALD

Sir?

NEWSMAN 6

You have been charged.

NEWSMAN 5

Were you ever in the Free Cuba

Movement or whatever the...

RUBY

(a voice in the back)

It was the Fair Play for Cuba

Committee.

NEWSMAN 6

What did you do in Russia?  What

happened to your eye?

TV OSWALD

A policeman hit me.

GARRISON

He seems pretty cool to me for a man

under pressure like that.

LIZ

Icy, you mean.

(shudders)

He gives me the willies... come on

sugarplums, it's past your bedtimes...

(to Jim)

Come on, let's go upstairs.

(rises)

Mattie - get ahold of yourself.

MATTIE

Why, Mr. Jim?  He was a great man,

Mr. Jim, a great man...

TV WADE

There is no one else but him.  He

has been charged in the Supreme Court

with murder with malice.  We're gonna

ask for the death penalty.

FRANK

(Newsman 7)

So several hours after the

assassination, a disturbed portrait

is emerging of Lee Harvey Oswald.

Described as shy and introverted, he

spent much of his childhood in New

Orleans, Louisiana and went to high

school there.  After a stint in the

Marines, he apparently became

fascinated by Communism and in 1959

defected to the Soviet Union.

BOB

(Newsman 8)

He married a Russian woman there,

Frank, had a child, and then returned

to the United States after 30 months.

But he is still believed to be a

dedicated Marxist and a fanatical

supporter of Fidel Castro and ultra

left wing causes.  He spent last

summer in New Orleans and was arrested

in a brawl with anti-Castro Cuban

exiles.

FRANK

(Newsman 7)

And apparently, Bob, Oswald had been

passing out pro-Castro pamphlets for

an organization called Fair Play for

Cuba, a Communist front he reportedly

belongs to.

BOB

(Newsman 8)

And we have Marina Oswald, his Russian-

born wife, who has identified the

rifle found in the Book Depository

as belonging to her husband.  And we

have...

JIM

(on the phone)

Lou, I'm sorry to disturb you this

late...  yeah, matter of routine but

we better get on this New Orleans

connection of Oswald's right away.

Check out his record, find any friends

or associates from last summer.

Let's meet with the senior assistants

and investigators day after tomorrow,

Sunday, yeah, at 11... Thanks Lou.

MARINA OSWALD

(on TV)

Lee good man... he not shoot anyone.

LOU

As far as Oswald's associates, boss,

the one name that keeps popping up

is David Ferrie.

JIM

I know David - a strange character.

LOU

He's been in trouble before.  Used

to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern

Airlines, but he got canned after an

alleged homosexual incident with a

14-year old boy.

BILL

(on phone, excited)

Get Kohlman... he told somebody the

Texas trip... yesterday mentioned to

somebody about Ferrie... find it

out.

NEWSMAN 1

These backyard photos were found

yesterday among Oswald's possessions

in the garage of Janet William's

home in Riving, Texas, where Marina

Oswald and her children are living.

The picture apparently was taken

earlier this year.  Police say the

rifle, a cheap World War II Italian-

made Mannlicher-Carcano, was ordered

from a Chicago mailing house and

shipped to Oswald's alias A. Hidell

at a post office box in March, 1963.

This is the same rifle that was used

to assassinate the President.

COX

That ties it up...

NUMA

Another nut.  Jesus, anybody can get

a rifle in Texas.

BILL

(hangs up)

So it seems that Dave Ferrie drove

off on a Friday afternoon for Texas -

a source told Kohlman he might have

been a getaway pilot for Oswald.

JIM

Hold your horses.  What kinda source?

BILL

(grins)

The anonymous kind, Chief.

OSER

I think I remember this guy Ferrie

speaking at a meeting of some

veteran's group.  Ranting against

Castro.  Extreme stuff.

NEWSMAN 1

We go back now to the basement of

police headquarters where they're

about to transfer Oswald to County

Prison...

ANNOUNCER

He's been shot!  Oswald's been shot!

VARIOUS VOICES

Goddamn!  Look at that... Look at

that... I don't believe this... Right

on TV!  What is going on?  Who is

this guy... oh Jesus.

LOU

Seventy cops in that basement.  What

the hell were they doing?

NEWSMAN 1

Jack Ruby... Who is Jack Ruby?  Oswald

is hurt.

LOU

Well, no trial now.  Looks like

somebody saved the Dallas D.A. a

pile of work.

JIM

(quietly)

Well, let's get Ferrie in here anyway.

LOU

Chief... David Ferrie.

JIM

(shakes hands)

Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make

yourself comfortable.  Coffee?

FERRIE

Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I

met you on Carondolet Street right

after your election.  I congratulated

you, remember?

JIM

How could I forget?  You make quite

a first impression.

(on intercom)

Sharon, could you please bring us

some coffee?

(Ferrie laughs; pause)

I've heard over the years you're

quite a first-rate pilot, Dave.

Legend has it you can get in and out

of any field, no matter how small...

(Jim points to the

pictures on his wall)

I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you

know.  Flew grasshoppers for the

field artillery in the war.

FERRIE

Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?

JIM

(holds up his pipe)

How could I?  Dave, as you know,

President Kennedy was assassinated

on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey

Oswald was arrested as a suspect and

then was murdered yesterday by a man

named Jack Ruby.

(on each name, watching

Ferrie's reaction)

We've heard reports that Oswald spent

the summer in New Orleans and we've

been advised you knew Oswald pretty

well.

FERRIE

That's not true.  I never met anybody

named Oswald.  Anybody who told you

that has to be crazy.

JIM

But you are aware, he served in your

Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a

teenager.

FERRIE

No... if he did, I don't remember

him.  There were lots of kids in and

out... y'know.

JIM

(hands him a current

newspaper)

I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps

you knew this man under another name?

FERRIE

No, I never saw him before in my

life.

JIM

Well that must've been mistaken

information we got.  Thanks for

straightening it out for us.

(puffs on pipe, Ferrie

looks relieved; images

of the funeral

continue on the TV)

There is one other matter that's

come up, Dave.  We were told you

took a trip to Texas shortly after

the assassination of Friday.

FERRIE

Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to

Houston.

JIM

What was so appealing about Houston?

FERRIE

I hadn't been there ice skating in

many years, and I had a couple of

young friends with me, and we decided

we wanted to go ice skating.

JIM

Dave, may I ask why the urge to go

ice skating in Texas happened to

strike you during one of the most

violent thunderstorms in recent

memory?

FERRIE

Oh, it was just a spur of the moment

thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.

JIM

I see.  And where did you drive?

FERRIE

We went straight to Houston, and

then Saturday night we drove to

Galveston and stayed over there.

JIM

Why Galveston?

FERRIE

No particular reason.  Just to go

somewhere.

JIM

And then Sunday?

FERRIE

In the morning we went goose hunting.

Then headed home, but I dropped the

boys off to see some relatives and I

stayed in Hammond.

JIM

Did you bag any geese on this trip?

FERRIE

I believe the boys got a couple.

JIM

But the boys told us they didn't get

any.

FERRIE

(fidgeting, lighting

another cigarette)

Oh yes, well, come to think of it,

they're right.  We got to where the

geese were and there were thousands

of them.  But you couldn't approach

them.  They were a wise bunch of

birds.

JIM

Your young friends also told us you

had no weapons in the car.  Dave,

isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for

geese without a shotgun?

FERRIE

Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison.

I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got

out there near the geese and it was

only then we realized we'd forgotten

our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of

course we didn't get any geese.

JIM

I see.

(stands up)

Dave thank you for your time.  I'm

sorry it has to end inconveniently

for you, but I'm going to have you

detained for further questioning by

the FBI.

FERRIE

(shaken)

Why?  What's wrong?

JIM

Dave, I find your story simply not

believable.

FBI SPOKESMAN

Gentlemen, this afternoon the FBI

released David W. Ferrie of New

Orleans.  After extensive questioning

and a thorough background check, the

Bureau found no evidence that...

FBI SPOKESMAN

(on TV)

...Mr. Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald

or that he has had any connection

with the assassination of President

Kennedy.  The Special Agent in Charge

would like to make clear that Mr.

Ferrie was brought in for questioning

by the District Attorney of Orleans

parish, not by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation.  The Bureau regrets

any trouble this may have caused Mr.

Ferrie...

NEWSMAN 9

In national news, President Johnson

has announced the creation of a blue

ribbon presidential commission to

probe the events in Dallas.

LOU

Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought

we were on the same side.  What the

hell business is it of theirs to say

that?

BILL

Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way

they let him go.

JIM

They must know something we don't.

(dismisses it)

So, let's get on with our lives,

gentlemen... we got plenty of home

grown crimes to prosecute.

NEWSMAN 9

The Commission will be headed by

Chief Justice of the United States

Supreme Court, Earl Warren, and is

expected to head off several

Congressional and Texas inquiries

into the assassination.  On the panel

are Allen Dulles, ex-chief of the

CIA, Representative Gerald Ford,

John J. McCloy, former head of Chase

Manhattan Bank...

SENATOR RUSSELL LONG

(looking out the window)

That's a mess down there, Jim.  We've

bitten off more "Vietnam" that we

can possibly chew.

LONG

(continuing)

Sad thing is the way it's screwing

up this country, all these hippies

running around on drugs, the way

young people look you can't tell a

boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a

girl the other day, she was pregnant -

you could see her whole belly, and

you know what she painted on it?

"Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa

control.  Values've gone to hell,

Jim... Course it figures when you

got somebody like that polecat Johnson

in the White House.

JIM

I sometimes feel things've gone

downhill since John Kennedy was

killed, Senator.

LONG

Don't get me started on that.  Those

Warren Commission fellows were pickin'

gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's

gonna tell me that kid did the

shooting job he did from that damned

bookstore.

STEWARDESS

Here you go, Senator Long.

JIM

(surprised)

I thought the FBI test-fired the

rifle to make sure it could be done?

LONG

Sure, three experts and not one of

them could do it!  They're telling

us Oswald got off three shots with

world-class precision from a manual

bolt action rifle in less than six

seconds - and accordin' to his Marine

buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he

wasn't any good.  Average man would

be lucky to get two shots off, and I

tell ya the first shot would always

be the best.  Here, the third shot's

perfect.  Don't make sense.  And

then they got that crazy bullet

zigzagging all over the place so it

hits Kennedy and Connally seven times.

One "pristine" bullet?  That dog

don't hunt.

JIM

You know, something always bothered

me about that from day one, and I

can't put my finger on it.

LONG

If I were investigatin', I'd round

up the 100 best riflemen in the world

and find out which ones were in Dallas

that day.  You been duck hunting?  I

think Oswald was a good old-fashioned

decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a

patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes

y'ask me.

JIM

You think there were other men

involved, Russell?

LONG

Hell, you're the District Attorney.

You read the Warren Report - and

then you tell me you're satisfied

Lee Oswald shot the President all by

his lonesome.

JIM

Russell, honestly you sound like one

of those kooky critics spreading

paranoia like prairie fire.  I just

can't believe the Chief Justice of

the United States would put his name

on something that wasn't true.

LONG

(to the stewardess)

Honey, another one of these.  This

one's as weak as cricket pee-pee.

Yessir, you mark my words, Jim,

Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and

it's gonna put that other varmint

Nixon in - then watch your hide,

'cause there ain't no offramps on a

freeway to Hell!

LIZ

Jim, dinner's just about ready...

I've got a surprise for you... tried

something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.

JIM

(lost in thought)

Mmmmm... sure smells good... but

Egghead, do you realize Oswald was

interrogated for twelve hours after

the assassination, with no lawyer

present, and nobody recorded a word

of it?  I can't believe it.  A police

captain with 30 years experience and

a crowd of Federal agents just had

to know that with no record anything

that Oswald said would be inadmissible

in court.

LIZ

Come on now, we'll talk about it at

the table, dinner's getting cold.

(to Jasper)

What are you doing in here?

JASPER

Daddy said it was all right if I was

real quiet.

JIM

(rising to dinner)

Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever

handled a minor felon like that,

it'd be all over the papers.  I'd

catch hell.  And this is the alleged

murderer of the President?

JIM

Again and again they ignore credible

testimony, leads are never followed

up, its conclusions are selective,

there's no index, it's one of the

sloppiest, most disorganized

investigations I've ever seen.  Dozens

and dozens of witnesses in Dealey

Plaza that day are saying they heard

shots coming from the Grassy Knoll

area in front of Kennedy and not the

Book Depository behind him, but it's

all broken down and spread around

and you read it and the point gets

lost.

MATTIE

I never did believe it either!

LIZ

(politely listening)

Uh huh... Mattie, I'll do the dishes,

you take Be up now.  And Elizabeth,

too, your bedtime, honey.

ELIZABETH JR.

Nahhhh!  I don't wanna go to bed!

LIZ

Honey, that was three years ago - we

all tried so hard to put that out of

our minds, why are you digging it up

again?  You're the D.A. of New

Orleans.  Isn't the Kennedy

assassination a bit outside your

domain?  I mean all those important

people already studied it.

JIM

I can't believe a man as intelligent

as Earl Warren ever read what's in

those volumes.

LIZ

Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll

give you one hour to solve the case...

until the kids are in bed.

(rising, she puts her

arms around him from

behind and kisses

his ear)

Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can

wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody

say goodnight to Daddy.

JASPER

(showing his drawing)

Dad, look what I drew.

JIM

(rising)

That's something, Jasper.  What is

it?

JASPER

A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another

hour?

JIM

(dancing)

Pickle and Snapper, my two favorite

dancing partners.

JIM

Goodnight, my doodle bugs.

KIDS

Goodnight, Daddy.

LIZ

One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday

night date you are.

(sighs)

Mama warned me this would happen if

I married such a serious man.

JIM

Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up

I'll show you how Saturday night got

invented.

BOWERS

I sealed off the area, and I held

off the trains until they could be

examined, and there was some

transients taken on at least one

train.

ATTORNEY

Mr. Bowers... is there anything else

you told me I haven't asked you about

that you can think of?

BOWERS

Nothing that I can recall.

ATTORNEY

Witness is excused.

SGT. HARKNESS

Well we got a long freight that was

in there, and we pulled some people

off of there and took them to the

station.

ATTORNEY (V.O.)

You mean some transients?

SGT. HARKNESS (V.O.)

Tramps and hoboes.

ATTORNEY (V.O.)

Were all those questioned?

SGT. HARKNESS (V.O.)

Yes, sir, they were taken to the

station and questioned.

JIM

(astounded)

And?

(writes "incomplete")

ATTORNEY (V.O.)

(switching subjects)

I want to go back to this Amos Euins.

(voices dribble off)

BOWERS (V.O.)

Yes sir, traffic had been cut off

into the area since about 10, but

there were three cars came in during

this time from around noon till the

time of the shooting... the cars

circled the parking lot, and left

like they were checking the area,

one of the drivers seemed to have

something he was holding to his

mouth... the last car came in about

7 to 10 minutes before the shooting,

a white Chevrolet, 4-door Impala,

muddy up to the windows.

BOWERS

Towards the underpass, I saw two men

standing behind a picket fence...

they were looking up towards Main

and Houston and following the caravan

as it came down.  One of them was

middle-aged, heavyset.  The other

man was younger, wearing a plaid

shirt and jacket.

BOWERS

There were two other men on the

eastern end of the parking lot.

Each of 'me had uniforms.

BOWERS

At the time of the shooting there

seemed to be some commotion... I

just am unable to describe - a flash

of light or smoke or something which

caused me to feel that something out

of the ordinary had occurred there

on the embankment...

HOLLAND (V.O.)

Four shots... a puff of smoke came

from the trees... behind that picket

fence... close to the little plaza -

There's no doubt whatever in my mind.

JIM

NO!

LIZ

Honey, you all right?

(looks at watch)

JIM

It's incredible, honey - the whole

thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies

that Lee Oswald was given a Russian

language exam as part of his Marine

training only a few months before he

defects to the Soviet Union.  A

Russian exam!

LIZ

(sitting up, angered)

I cannot believe this.  It's four-

thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five

children are gonna be awake in another

hour and ...

JIM

Honey, in all my years in the service

I never knew a single man who was

given a Russian test.  Oswald was a

radar operator.  He'd have about as

much use for Russian as a cat has

for pajamas.

LIZ

These books are getting to your mind,

Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop

readin' them.

JIM

And then this Colonel tries to make

it sound like nothing.  Oswald did

badly on the test, he says.  "He

only had two more Russian words right

than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me

saying Touchdown here...

(points to the dog)

...is not very intelligent because I

beat him three games out of five the

last time we played chess.

LIZ

(gives up)

Jim, what is going on, for heaven's

sake!  You going to stay up all night

every night?  For what?  So you'll

be the only man in America who read

the entire 26 volumes of the Warren

Report?

JIM

Liz, do I have to spell it out for

you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary

soldier.  That was no accident he

was in Russia.  He was probably in

military intelligence.  That's why

he was trained in Russian.

LIZ

(with a quizzical

look)

Honey, go back to sleep, please!

JIM

Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three

years!

LIZ

Will you stop rattling on about

Kennedy for a few minutes, honey...

come on.

JIM

Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking

tour?

BILL

At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not

exactly fresh blood we're sniffing

here, boss.

JIM

(points)

Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.

JIM

Remember whose office this was back

in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.

LOU

Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He

died couple years ago.

JIM (V.O.)

Headed the Chicago office.  When he

retired he became a private eye here.

I used to have lunch with him.  John

Birch Society, Minutemen, slightly

to the right of Attila the Hun.

Used to recruit college students to

infiltrate radical organizations on

campus.  All out of this office.

Now come around here, take a look at

this...

JIM

544 Camp Street.  Same building as

531 Lafayette, right... but different

address and different entrances both

going to the same place - the offices

on the second and third floors.

JIM

Guess who used this address?

BANISTER

(under)

See this?  What the hell is this

doing on this piece of paper?

(he moves away)

Asshole.

LOU (V.O.)

My God!  Lee Harvey Oswald.

JIM (V.O.)

Bull's-eye.  How do we know he was

here?  Cause this office address was

stamped on the pro-Casto leaflets he

was handing out in the summer of '63

down on Canal street.  They were the

same leaflets that were found in his

garage in Dallas.

JIM

He was arrested that day for fighting

with some anti-Castro Cubans... but

actually he had contacted them a few

days earlier as an ex-Marine trying

to join the anti-Castro crusade.

When they heard he was now pro-Castro,

they paid him a visit.

CARLOS

(haranguing passerby)

He's a traitor, this man!  Don't

believe a word he tells you!

(to Oswald)

You sonofabitch, you liar, you're a

Communist, go back to Moscow.

OSWALD

Okay, Carlos, if you want to hit me,

hit me.

JIM (V.O.)

There was no real fight and the

arresting Lieutenant later said he

felt it was a staged incident.  In

jail, Oswald asked to talk to Special

Agent John Quigley of the FBI who

showed up immediately.  They have a

private session.  Oswald is released

and Quigley destroys his notes from

the interview.

JIM

But the arrest gets him a lot of

publicity and as a result Oswald

appears on a local TV debate that

established his credentials as a

Communist.

BRINGUIER

But you're a Communist, are you not,

and you defected to Russia.

OSWALD

No, I am not a Communist.  But I am

a Marxist-Leninist.

BRINGUIER

What did you do when you were in

Russia?

OSWALD

(defensive)

I worked while I was there.  I was

always under the protection of...

that is to say, I was not under the

protection of the U.S. Government.

BILL

What the hell's a Communist like Lee

Oswald doing working out of

Banister's?

JIM

Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill?

I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was

ever a Communist... after the arrest,

544 Camp Street never appeared on

the pamphlets again.  Now here's

another one for you:  What would you

say if I told you Lee Oswald had

been trained in the Russian language

when he was a Marine?

LOU

I'd say he was probably getting

intelligence training.

JIM

Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who

would be running that training?

LOU

The Office of Naval Intelligence.

JIM

Take a look across the street.

LOU

Post Office.

JIM

Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office

of Naval Intelligence - And just by

coincidence, Banister, before he was

FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?

LOU

"Once ONI, always ONI"?

BILL

Well, he likes to work near his old

pals.

JIM

Bill, Lou, we're standing in the

heart of the United States

Government's intelligence community

in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there,

the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't

this seem to you a rather strange

place for a Communist to spend his

spare time?

LOU

What are you driving at, boss?

JIM

We're going back into the case, Lou -

the murder of the President.  I want

you to take some money from the Fees

and Fines Account and go to Dallas -

talk to some people.  Bill, I want

you to get Oser on the medical, the

autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby

histories, tax records...

BILL

Lord, wake me, please.  I must be

dreaming.

JIM

No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead

serious.  And we're going to start

by tracking down your anonymous source

from three years ago.  How did you

find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas

that day?

JIM

You're not under cross-examination

here, Jack.

JIM

Here's my problem, Jack.  You told

me you and Guy were good friends for

a long time?

MARTIN

More than ten years.

JIM

And he never hit you before?

MARTIN

Never touched me.

JIM

Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day

of the President's murder - our police

report says he pistol-whipped you

with a .357 Magnum.

(Martin's eyes are

fixed on Jim)

But the police report says you had

an argument over the phone bill.

Here, take a look at it.

(Martin looks at the

report)

Now, does a simple argument over

phone bills sound like a believable

explanation to you?

MARTIN

(shaking his head

slowly, dreamily)

No, it involved more than that.

JIM

How much more?

MARTIN

(waits)

I don't know if I should talk about

this.

JIM

Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly,

you know - heart attack, wasn't it?

MARTIN

If you buy what you read in the paper.

JIM

You have other information?

MARTIN

I didn't say that.  All I know is he

died suddenly just before the Warren

Report came out.

JIM

Why did Guy beat you, Jack?

MARTIN

Well, I guess now that Guy's dead,

it don't really matter... it was

about the people hanging around the

office that summer.  I wasn't really

part of the operation, you know.  I

was handling the private-eye work

for Guy when that came in - not much

did - but that's why I was there...

it was a nuthouse.  There were all

these Cubans coming and going.  They

all looked alike to me.

MARTIN

Dave Ferrie - you know about him?

JIM (V.O.)

Was he there often?

MARTIN (V.O.)

Often?  He practically lived there.

It was real cloak and dagger stuff.

They called it Operation Mongoose.

The idea was to train all these Cuban

exiles for another invasion of Cuba.

Banister's office was part of a supply

line that ran from Dallas, through

New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling

arms and explosives.

JIM (V.O.)

All this right under the noses of

the intelligence community in

Lafayette Square?

MARTIN (V.O.)

Sure.  Everybody knew everybody.  It

was a network.  They were working

for the CIA - pilots, black operations

guys, civilians, military - everybody

in those days was running guns

somewhere... Fort Jefferson, Bayou

Bluff, Morgan City... McAllen, Texas

was a big gun-running operation.

JIM (V.O.)

Where is Banister in all this?

MARTIN (V.O.)

Banister was running his camp north

of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled

a lot of the training.  There was a

shooting range and a lot of tropical

terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans

got trained, too.  Nazi types.

Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the

craziest.

MARTIN

Anyway, late summer the party ended.

Kennedy didn't want another Bay of

Pigs mess, so he ordered the FBI to

shut down the camps and confiscate

the napalm and the C-4.  There were

a buncha Cubans and a couple Americans

arrested, only you didn't read about

it in the papers.  Just the weapons

got mentioned... 'cause the first

ones behind bars would've been

Banister and Ferrie, but I think the

G-men were just going through the

motions for Washington.  Their hearts

were with their old FBI buddy

Banister.

MARTIN

Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.

JIM

And Oswald?

MARTIN

(finally)

Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes

he'd be meeting with Banister with

the door shut.  Other times he'd be

shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But

he was there all right.

JIM

Anything more specific, Jack?  It's

important.

MARTIN (V.O.)

Yeah, one time the secretary got

upset, I remember...

SECRETARY

I can't believe it, Mr. Banister.

Lee Oswald is down on Canal Street

giving out Communist leaflets

supporting Castro!

BANISTER

It's okay, Delphine, he's with us.

JIM

Anyone else involved at Banister's

level?

MARTIN

(shrugs)

There was one guy, I don't know, big

guy, business guy, white hair - I

saw him come into the office once.

He looked out of place, y'know -

like a society guy.  Can't remember

his name.

(thinking)

Oswald was with him.

MARTIN

He had something to do with money.

I remember him cause Guy, who didn't

kiss anybody's ass, sure kissed his.

MARTIN

Clay something, that was his name -

Clay.

JIM

Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?

MARTIN

Yeah!  That's it.

(pause, paranoid)

I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I

gotta go.

JIM

(to Bill)

Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren

Report.  He tried to get Oswald a

lawyer.

(to Martin)

Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?

MARTIN

Sure.  'Course they hated the

sonofabitch, but...

JIM

The assassination, Jack?

MARTIN

(tightens)

Never.  Not with me sir, never...

Listen, I think I'd better go.  I

said enough.  I said all I'm going

to say.

(rises suddenly)

JIM

Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?

MARTIN

What's the problem?  What's the

problem?  Do I need to spell it out

for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.

JIM

Nobody knows what we're talking about,

Jack.

MARTIN

You're so naive, mister.

BILL

Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief,

but the man's an obvious alcoholic

with a reputation lower than crocodile

piss.

JIM

Does that bother you, Bill?  I always

wondered in court why it is because

a woman is a prostitute, she has to

have bad eyesight.

BILL

He'll never sign a statement, boss,

let alone get on a witness stand.

JIM

When something's rotten in the land,

Bill, it generally isn't just one

fish, we'll get corroboration...

find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were

a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1

it's an alias.  Start checking around

the Quarter.

BILL

And the six of us, with almost no

budget and in secret, are going to

solve the case that the Warren

Commission with dozens of support

staff and millions of dollars couldn't

solve.  We can't keep up with the

crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.

JIM

The murder of a President, Bill, is

a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I

didn't pick you because of your legal

skill, you know.

BILL

Gee, thanks boss.

JIM

But because you're a fighter.  I

like a man who isn't scared of bad

odds.

BLACK WOMAN

How ya doing, Mr. Garrison?  Remember

me - from the piano bar at the Royal

Orleans?

JIM

I sure do.  We sang "You're the Cream

in My Coffee."

JIM

(to Numa)

Make sure we come back here, now.

MAITRE D'

Mr. Garrison, we have not seen enough

of you lately.

JIM

Been too busy, Paul - an elected man

can't have as much fun as he used

to.

(seeing Lou and Al)

Welcome back, Lou.  Find out anything

on those hobos?

LOU

They took 'em to the Sheriff's office,

not the police station, and they let

'em go.  No record of them ever being

questioned.

JIM

I can't say that comes as a surprise

anymore.

LOU

A photographer from The Dallas Times

Herald got some great shots of them

never published...

LOU

...take a good look, chief, do any

of 'em look like the hoboes you

remember?

JIM

Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep

in their clothes - these two look

pretty young.

LOU

...not a single frayed collar or

cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves,

clean hands - new shoe leather.

Look at the ear of the cop... That's

a wire.  What's a cop wearing a

headset for?  I think they're actors,

chief; they're not cops.

JIM

Who the hell are they, then!  Hi,

Susie, sit down.

(to Lou)

This could be it.  Let's start looking

for 'em.

LOU

Graveyard dead.  August this year.

(Jim curses quietly)

A single car accident on an empty

road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor

said he was in some kind of strange

shock when he died.

(pause)

JIM

(shares the look)

We need to find more witnesses, Lou.

LOU

There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore.

Two Cubans threw her out of a car on

the way to Dallas.

JIM

Can we find her?

LOU

Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas

in '65.  Two in the morning on some

highway.  A hit and run.

BILL

Why not go right to the horse's mouth,

chief?

JIM

If we go to him our investigation'll

hit the front pages by sunrise.

Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was

just given a new trial.  If he has

something to say, it'll be there.

Susie, what did you find out on

Oswald?

SUSIE

Negative on his tax records.

Classified.  First time I know a

D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put

together a list of all the CIA files

on Oswald that were part of the Warren

Report and asked for them.  There

are about 1200 documents...

(gives it to Jim who

reads)

Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City,

Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel

file, a memo from the Director on

Oswald, travel and activities - can't

get one of them.  All classified as

secret on the grounds of national

security.  It's real strange.

BILL

Maybe there's more to this, Susie.

The CIA's keeping something from our

enemies.

SUSIE

Yes, but we're talking about a dead

warehouse employee of no political

significance.  Three years later and

he's still classified?  They gave us

his grammar school records, a study

of his pubic hairs... Put it in

context, Bill, of what we know about

Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father,

unstable childhood, high school

dropout - wants to grow up and be a

spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He

learns Russian, he acts overtly

Marxist with two other marines, but

he's stationed at a top secret base

in Japan where U2 spy flights over

Russia originate.  He's discharged

from the Marines supposedly because

his mother's sick.  He stays home 3

days, then with a $1500 ticket from

a $203 bank account, he goes to

Moscow...

OSWALD

(voice stilted)

I want to renounce my citizenship

and become a Soviet citizen.  I'm

going to make known to them all

information I have concerning the

Marine Corps and my specialty therein,

radar operation...

SUSIE (V.O.)

One of the consuls, John McVickar,

says Oswald's performance was not

spontaneous - it seemed coached.

Oswald gives an interview to a

journalist.

OSWALD

I will never return to the United

States for any reason.  It is a

capitalist country, an exploitive,

racist country.  I am a Marxist since

I was 15.  I've seen poor niggers

and that was a real lesson.  People

hate because they're told to hate,

like school kids.  It's the fashion

to hate people in the U.S.

SUSIE (V.O.)

The Russians are skeptical - want to

send him back.  Maybe they suspect

he's a spy.  He supposedly slashes

his wrists in a suicide attempt so

that they're forced to keep him, and

he disappears for six weeks,

presumably with the KGB.

SUSIE

Finally they shuttle him to a radio

factory in Minks where he lives as

high on the hog as he ever has -

he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy

apartment with a balcony, has affairs

with local girls.

JIM

Makes sense - he's a spokesman.

SUSIE

But he never writes, speaks, or does

any propaganda for the Russians.  He

meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel

in Soviet intelligence, at a trade

union dance; she thinks he's Russian

the way he speaks, six weeks later

they marry, have a daughter.

NUMA

Didn't someone say he didn't speak

good Russian?

JIM

It's a contradiction, Numa, get used

to them.  The only explanation for

the royal treatment is he did give

them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.

SUSIE (V.O.)

I don't know if it's coincidence,

but Oswald had a top security

clearance and knew about the U2

program from his days at Atsugi Air

Base in Japan.  Six months after he

arrives in Russia, Francis Gary

Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in

Russia.  That plane was untouchable.

Powers hinted that Oswald could've

given the Russians enough data to

hit it.  As a direct result, the

peace summit between Khrushchev and

Eisenhower failed.  I can't help

thinking of that book Seven Days In

May, maybe someone in our military

didn't want the Peace Conference to

happen, maybe Oswald was part of

that.  It gets weirder.

BILL

Susie, you're an assistant D.A.,

remember.  Stick to what you can

prove in court.

SUSIE

You want facts, Bill?  Okay.  From

1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers

defect to Russia.  From '59 to '60,

seven defect, six return, one of

them another Marine a month before

Oswald.  All of them young men made

to seem poor, disenchanted.

JIM

Don't get sidetracked!  How does he

get back to the States?  That's the

point.  Does he have any problems?

SUSIE

None!  The State Department issues

him a new passport in 48 hours and

loans him the money to travel.  He's

never investigated or charged by the

Navy for revealing classified

information or, as far as we know,

debriefed by the CIA.

JIM

This is a man whose secrets cause us

to change our radar patterns in the

Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted

as a traitor!

SUSIE

The FBI finally gets around to talking

to him in Dallas and runs a file on

him as a miscreant Communist type.

JIM

But who meets him when he gets off

the boat in New York in June '62?

SUSIE (V.O.)

Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of

an anti-Communist group.

JIM (V.O.)

And Marina?  Does she have a problem

getting out?

SUSIE (V.O.)

None either.  It's bizarre.  It's

next to impossible to get Russian

sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have

any problem getting a new passport

when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia

in '63.  A man who has defected once

already.  It's crazy.

JIM

Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary

people get blacklisted for leftist

affiliations!  The State Department

did everything short of dispatching

a destroyer to Minks to insure

Oswald's return.  Only intelligence

people can come and go like that.

SUSIE (V.O.)

The next thing we know he's living

in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62

working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles-

Stovall, a photographic firm that

contracts to make maps for the U.S.

Army... He starts work only days

before the government reveals Russian

missiles in Cuba and the crisis

explodes.  Oswald may have had access

to missile site footage obtained by

the U2 planes and works alongside a

young man who'd been in the Army

Security Agency.

JIM

Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming

back to George Washington's cabinet.

SUSIE

Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming

chummy with the White Russian

community of Dallas - all rabid anti-

Communists.

SUSIE

His closest friend is an oilman named

George de Mohrenschildt who's about

35 years older than Oswald, who's

only 23 and supposedly broke.  De

Mohrenschildt is a member of the

Dallas Petroleum Club, speaks five

languages and was in French Vichy

Intelligence during the War.  Also

rumoured to have been a Nazi

sympathizer and member of the

"Solidarists", an international anti-

Communist organization with many

Eastern Europeans and ex-Nazis, many

of them brought here by the CIA after

the war, many of them involved in

oil and munitions interests in Dallas

and the Southwest.  You figure it.

AL

Where'd you get all this Nazi stuff?

SUSIE

(hands him a file)

Read it.  They called it "Project

Paperclip."

JIM (V.O.)

This is the guy that keeps turning

up in colonial countries and each

time something strange happens.

Coup d'etats, presidents overthrown.

He shows up on a "walking tour" of

Guatemala's Cuban invasion camps

just before the Bay of Pigs invasion.

If we don't know he's CIA, let's

circle him very probable - Oswald's

handler.

OSWALD

I think he's made some mistakes on

Cuba, but he's doing a pretty good

job.  If he succeeds, in my opinion,

he'll be a great President.  And a

really attractive one too - open

features, great head of hair...

(laughs)

SUSIE (V.O.)

De Mohrenschildt draws a picture of

Oswald as an intellectual, well read,

speaks excellent Russian, a man who

adored J.F.K.

JIM

That's scenery.  Don't get

sidetracked.  This is the man, bottom

line, who nailed Oswald to the Warren

Commission as a potentially violent

man, and linked him to the rifle.

GEORGE

So, Lee, what are you taking a potshot

at this week - rabbits or fascists?

SUSIE

The only Russian that suspects Oswald

of still being a Communist is Anna

Meller.  But her Russian friend tells

her "he's checked" with the local

FBI and was told Oswald is all right.

SUSIE

The Oswalds are introduced by George

de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill

Williams.  It's through Janet Williams

in October '63 that Lee gets the

warehouse job, right smack on Elm

Street at the Book Depository, which

is owned by another oilman with ties

to defense and military intelligence.

JIM (V.O.)

Presumably so he can now exercise

his intellect stacking school texts

at $1.25 an hour.

SUSIE (V.O.)

All I can find out about the Williams'

is their tax returns are classified

and that Bill Williams, a descendant

of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has

links through his family and United

Fruit to the CIA and does classified

work for Bell Helicopter which

requires a security clearance - so

what is Oswald, a defector, doing

visiting his wife in his house?

Williams has a relationship at Bell

with General Walter Dornberger,

another one of the Nazis we brought

in after the War for our missile

program.  He used slave labor to

build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler

before Bell needed him.

JIM

I wonder about the Williams'.  Just

where did the first description of

Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one

knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's,

but his description came after 1

P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's

been tapping the Williams' and picks

up a call between Bell Helicopter

and Janet's phone, an unidentified

voice saying "We both know who's

responsible."  Who called?  Why's

the Bureau been tapping them?

SUSIE (V.O.)

His wife, Janet Williams, studied

Russian in college and her father

worked for the Agency for

International Development, which

works hand in hand with the CIA.

She suddenly becomes Marina's best

friend.  Marina fights often with

Lee about many things - his secrecy,

the lack of money.  She says Lee is

not sexually adequate.  Lee hits her

on several occasions.  Bill Williams'

convenient separation from Janet

allows Janet to invite Marina to

move into her house in Irving.  There

Marina and Lee have a second daughter -

while Lee, now 24, stores his

belongings in Janet's garage and

rents a small room in Dallas under

an alias of "O.H. Lee".

SUSIE

When he's arrested, Marina buries

him with the public.  Her description

of him is that of a psychotic and

violent man.

MARINA

I do not want to believe, but I have

too much facts.. tell me that Lee

shot Kennedy.

JIM (V.O.)

Yeah, after, they take her to Six

Flags Inn in Arlington, prepare her

for the interviews, teach her how

she should answer - and after two

months and 46 interviews, she has a

nervous breakdown.

(flashback)

Oswald was no angel, that's clear,

but who was he?

BILL

I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying

here?

JIM

We're saying that when Oswald went

to Russia, he was not a real defector,

that he was an intelligence agent on

some kind of mission for our

government and he remained one till

the day he died, that's what we're

saying.

BILL

And therefore because Oswald pulled

the trigger, the intelligence

community murdered their own commander

in chief.  That's what you're saying!

JIM

I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald

didn't even pull the trigger, Bill.

The nitrate test indicates he didn't

even fire a rifle on November 22nd.

And on top of that, they didn't even

bother to check if the rifle had

been fired that day.

BILL

He had his palm print on the weapon.

JIM

It went to the goddamn FBI and they

didn't find a goddamn thing.  It

comes back a week later and one guy

in the Dallas police department

suddenly finds a palm print which

for all I know he could've taken off

Oswald at the morgue.  There's no

chain of evidence, Bill.  And what

about the tow guns actually seen in

the Depository?  One an Enfield

photographed by a newsman and the

other a Mauser, described by Deputy

Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee

Oswald was exactly what he said he

was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at

face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going

with my gut here.  He's got an alias

of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H.

Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's

in a name, right?  In intelligence,

they're assumed to be fake.  A name

is sort of like a postbox number, a

code - several different people can

use the same name, right?  Then why

can't somebody be using Oswald's

name?

BILL

But why?

JIM

To frame him, obviously.  You got to

get in your minds how the hell spooks

think, Bill!  They're not ordinary

crooks.

LOU

I never could figure out why this

guy orders a traceable weapon to

that post office box when you can go

into any store in Texas, give a phony

name and walk out with a cheap rifle

which can never be traced.

JIM

Unless he or someone else wants him

to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered

the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did.

It was picked up at the post office

early morning when Oswald's time

sheet shows him clocked in at his

job.  Lou, come alive.  These things

are not adding up.

BILL

I still have to question what the

legal basis is that supports this,

boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful,

but...

JIM

Let's start making some assumptions

about the man.  Why would he leave a

path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's?

This is not a thin trail, gentlemen,

it is a very wide one.  Who found

the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou,

Bill, Susie, I want you to go back

and check all the sightings of Oswald

in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in

the summer and fall of '63 - see if

it's the same guy.

AL

Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds

like James Bond now.

JIM

Al, you can't tell a mink from a

coonskin unless you see the fur up

close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't

start reading between the lines here!

Y'all gotta start thinking on a

different level - like the CIA does.

We're through the looking glass.

Here white is black and black is

white.

BILL

What do you think, Lou?

LOU

I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I

leave the theories to you lawyers.

BILL

You, Numa?

NUMA

A week ago I would've said this is

nuts, but now ...

(shakes his head)

There's a lot of smoke there, but

there's some fire.

BILL

Now you guys, come on.  You're talking

about the United States Government

here!

JIM

We're talking about a crime, Bill.

No one is above the law.  Reduce it.

A crime was committed.  Let's get to

work.

RUBY

Christ, what the hell kinda needle

is that?  I just got a cold for

Chrissake.  I don't want any shot!

DOCTOR

Please relax, Mr. Ruby.  This'll

calm you down and clear this up.

RUBY

Doc, I'm telling you, I don't need

any shots.

DOCTOR

Mr. Ruby, I don't want to involve

the guards.  It'll just take a few

seconds.

RUBY

Then do you understand that I cannot

tell the truth here?  In Dallas.

That there are people here who do

not want me to tell the truth...

who do not want me to have a retrial?

OFFICIAL

Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you

can't tell us now.

RUBY

When are you going back to Washington,

sir?

OFFICIAL

(looks at watch)

I am going back very shortly after

we finish this hearing - I am going

to have some lunch.

RUBY

Can I make a statement?  If you

request me to go back to Washington

with you right now, that is if you

want to hear further testimony from

me, can you do that?  Can you take

me with you?

OFFICIAL

No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby.

There are a good many things involved

in that.

RUBY

What are they?

OFFICIAL

Well, the public attention it would

attract.  And we have no place for

you there to be safe, we're not law

enforcement officials, and many things

are at stake in this affair, Mr.

Ruby.

RUBY

But if I am eliminated there won't

be any way of knowing.  Consequently

a whole new form of government is

going to take over this country, and

I know I won't live to see you another

time.  My life is in danger here.

Do I sound screwy?

OFFICIAL

Well I don't know what can be done,

Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what

you anticipate we will encounter.

RUBY

Then you don't stand a chance, Mr.

Chief Justice, you have a lost cause.

All I want is a lie detector test,

and you refuse to give it to me.

Because as it stands now - and the

truth serum - how do you pronounce

it - Pentothal - whatever it is.

They will not give it to me, because

I want to tell the truth... And then

I want to leave this world.

ANDREWS

Why you keep dancing on my head for,

my man?  We been thicker'n molasses

pie since law school.

JIM

Because you keep conning me, Dean.

I read your testimony to the Warren

Commission and...

ANDREWS

There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two

sides to every coin.

JIM

You tell them the day after the

assassination you were called on the

phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and

asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee

Oswald's layer.

ANDREWS

Right.

JIM

Now that's pretty important, Dean.

You also told the FBI when you met

him, he was six foot two.  Then you

tell the Commission he was five foot

eight.  How the hell did the man

shrink like that, Dean?

ANDREWS

They put the heat on, my man, just

like you're doing.  I gave'em anything

that popped into my cabeza.  Truth

is, I never met the dude.

ANDREWS

I don't know what the cat looks like

and furthermore I don't know where

he's at.  All I know is sometimes he

sends me cases.  So one day he's on

the phone talkin' to me about going

to Dallas and repping Oswald...

(notices a woman, in

present)

Hey, pipe the bimbo in red.  What

ever happened to that little gal you

was dating in the Quarter - from

Opelousas, y'know, elevator didn't

go to the top floor but tits could

smother gumbo with.

JIM

(remembering)

Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but

not half as cute as you, Deano.  You

shoulda tried a legitimate line of

business.

ANDREWS

(chuckles)

You can't ever say crime don't pay

in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good

as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't

it?

JIM

When did you first do business with

this Bertrand?

ANDREWS

(bored)

Oh, I first heard these street cats

jiving about him back in '56, '57

when I lived down in the Quarter.

JIM

Street cats?

ANDREWS

Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young

fags, you know.  They'd come into my

bureau needing help, no bread, and

I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller,

who gonna back you up?  These

cornmuffins go to the phone and

dial...

ANDREWS

The dude on the other end says...

CLAY BERTRAND

I'm Clay Bertrand.  Whatever they

owe, I guarantee.

ANDREWS

Hey, suits me fine, Daddy Warbucks -

how do I get in touch with you?

CLAY BERTRAND

I'm around.

ANDREWS (V.O.)

And that's how I first heard of Clay

Bertrand.

JIM (V.O.)

What was his voice like?

ANDREWS

You knew you weren't talking to some

low life fag, you know.  He had

command of the king's English.

JIM

Did he pay?

ANDREWS

Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish

I had a million of those bimbettes.

JIM

And Oswald?

ANDREWS

(just a slight

hesitation)

Like I told to the Washington boys,

Bertrand called that summer and asked

me to help the kid upgrade his Marine

discharge...

JIM

So you saw Oswald how many times?

ANDREWS

Three, four.  He came in with a few

Cubano swishes one time I remember...

JIM (V.O.)

Recall any names?

ANDREWS

(in present)

Mario, Jose - they wear names like

you and I wear clothes.  Today the

name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie.

I wish I could help you, Jim.

JIM

Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?

ANDREWS

(knee-jerk reaction)

Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat

right off, this isn't my scene, man.

I deal with muni court, I'm a hack

in nigger town, that kid needs a hot

dog.

JIM

Then how the hell did you get in the

Warren Commission, Dean?  Except

through the phone records in the

Dallas jail?

ANDREWS

(nervous moment)

There were no phone records.

JIM

Of course there weren't. 'Cause they

disappeared.  And yet the Commission

found you, Dean.

ANDREWS

I don't know how they got to me.

Maybe cause I repped him here.  The

Feebees run background checks.  On

my mama's breasts, man, that's all I

got.

(pauses, adjusts)

There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If

there were, why the hell didn't Bobby

Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney

General, he was his brother for

Chrissake.  How the fuck three people

could keep a secret like that, I

don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was

a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated

this country.

JIM

Dean, I think we're having a

communication problem.  I know you

know who Clay Bertrand is.  Now stop

eating that damn crabmeat for a minute

and listen.

(gets Dean's attention)

I'm aware of our long friendship,

but I want you to know I'm going to

call you in front of a grand jury.

I took nine judges on, Deano, right

here in New Orleans, and I beat 'em

all.  If you lie to the grand jury

as you've been lying to me, I'm going

to charge you with perjury.  Now, am

I communicating with you?

ANDREWS

Is this off the record, Daddy-o?

(Jim nods)

In that case, let me sum it up for

you real quick.  If I answer that

question you keep asking me, if I

give you the name of the "Big

Enchilada", y'know, then it's bon

voyage, Deano - I mean like permanent.

I mean like a bullet in my head.

You dig?  Does that help you see my

problem a little better?  You're a

mouse fighting a gorilla.  Kennedy's

dead as that crab meat.  The

government's still breathing.  You

want to line up with a dead man?

JIM

Read my lips, Deano.  Either you

dance into the Grand Jury with the

real identity of Clay Bertrand or

your fat behind is going to the

slammer.  Do you dig me?

ANDREWS

You're just as crazy as your mama.

Goes to show it's in the genes!  Do

you have any idea what you're getting

into, my man?  You think Jack Ruby

just up and died of cancer in four

weeks after he gets a retrial?  That's

some kinda new cancer - I'd say that's

a "going out of business cancer".

You got the right ta-ta, but the

wrong ho-ho.  The government's gonna

jump all over your head, Jimbo, and

go "cock-a-doodledoo!"

VOICE (V.O.)

District Attorney Garrison to see

Prisoner 5388, Ward Block 237B.

GUARD'S VOICE (V.O.)

Send him on in.

GUARD

(with evident pride)

...we don't need no gates out there,

sir, we got the "swamp".  Many of

'em gone in there but none come out...

Hey, Willie!

GUARD

You got some company, wants to talk

wid you.  You behave now, boy, y'hear.

JIM

I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe,

for this time.

O'KEEFE

Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin'

but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes,

hours, days, years of'em.  Time just

stands still here like a snake sunnin'

itself in the road...

BILL

Clay Bertrand, Willie?

O'KEEFE

Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in

June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar.

Dave Ferrie took me there, for the

express reason to meet him.

JIM

For sexual purposes?

O'KEEFE

Well... yeah.

BILL (V.O.)

Did he pay you for this?

O'KEEFE (V.O.)

Twenty dollars each time.  Hell,

it's no secret.  That's what I'm

here for.

JIM (V.O.)

Anything else unusual about him you'd

be able to describe in a court of

law, Willie?

O'KEEFE (V.O.)

I remember he had some kinda thing

wrong with his left leg.  He limped.

Don't get me wrong, he's not one of

those, you know, limp wrists.  He's

a butch John.  You'd meet him on the

street, you'd never snap.  You could

go fishing with him, play poker with

him, you'd never snap in a million

years.  So one night we were over at

Ferrie's place.  Having a party.

Sometime in the late summer of '63.

O'KEEFE

...there were about nine or ten

people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing

some stuff in the bush with him.

Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a

mess,

(laughs)

Y'know he had all those mice cages

around cause he's working on this

cure for cancer... Dave's smart -

real smart - speaks five languages,

knows philosophy, medicine, military

history, politics.  He wanted to be

a priest but they defrocked him 'cause

he was queer...

BILL (V.O.)

And that's where you met Oswald for

the first time?

O'KEEFE (V.O.)

Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced

him as...

FERRIE

Willie, say hello to Leon Oswald.

O'KEEFE

(over the racket)

How ya doing?

OSWALD

(sullen, to Ferrie)

What the fuck's he doing here?

O'KEEFE

Fuck you, man.

FERRIE

(to O'Keefe)

Leon's in a bad mood, don't get

excited, he's all right.

JIM (V.O.)

Would you say this "Leon" was actually

Lee Harvey Oswald?

O'KEEFE

(in present)

Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in

jail.  I got no reason to lie to

you.  I ain't no nigger.

BILL

Go on, Willie.

O'KEEFE

(present merging to

past)

...well the party got crazier and

crazier, one of those, y'know

"beatnik" type things.

FERRIE

(to O'Keefe)

We're having a little meeting here.

(indicates the second

player)

That's Castro.  Sounds like Hitler

doesn't he?  Sonofabitch is going to

go.  Real soon.

CUBANS

Muerte a Fidel!  Muerte!

BERTRAND

(irritated at the

noise)

Oh, stop it already!  What are all

these people doing here anyway?  I

can't bear all this infernal noise.

FERRIE

Clara, don't be so sensitive.

BERTRAND

I didn't come here for a pep rally.

Get all this riffraff out of here.

FERRIE

Okay, okay.

O'KEEFE (V.O.)

...finally they got out of there and

I found myself alone with Dave and

this Leon, two of the Cubans, and

this guy Bertrand.  Dave pulled out

his clippings which he was always

carrying around.  He'd been obsessed

with Castro and Kennedy for months

and he started in again...

FERRIE

(waving a clipping,

drunk)

Kennedy fucked us in '61, '62, and

he's fuckin' us now!  And that fuckin'

zealot Bobby Kennedy is the fuckee!

The nerve of that little asswipe

closing the camps.  Took all our C-

4!  Took ten thousand rounds, 3,000

pounds of gunpowder, all our weapons.

Next we'll be living in a world where

only the cocksucking Reds will have

all the weapons and we'll be

surrounded.  If we want a free Cuba,

we gotta whack out the fucking beard.

CUBAN

That faggot Kennedy won't let us.

Our hands are empty - how can we

kill him?

BERTRAND

(moving with a drink,

walks with a slight

limp)

It's a real problem getting at him.

Castro's got informers on every block.

FERRIE

(pointing to a map of

Cuba on the wall)

Bullshit!  There's all kinds of new

stuff.  I heard about rockets in an

umbrella - they're tested at Fort

Detrick?  I can show you a dozen

poisons.  Stick it in his food, he'll

die in three days, no trace.  We can

put something in his beard, make it

fall out, he'll look fuckin'

ridiculous without his beard.

CUBAN

(drunk)

Why don't we just take care of the

main problem?  Which is that piece

of shit Kennedy.  He's doing all

kinds of deals!  Kissing Khrushchev's

ass.  I wouldn't even call him

President Kennedy.

O'KEEFE (V.O.)

...then the Cubans left and the

bullshitting was going on, Dave was

drunk, really drunk and he starts in

with Kennedy again.

FERRIE

See, what Kennedy done, with him you

should take a knife and stab and

kill the fucker where he is now.  I

mean it.  This is true.  But I tell

you something.  I hope I get a week's

notice.  I'll kill.  Right in the

fuckin' White House.  Somebody's got

to get rid of this fucker.

O'KEEFE

Oh, c'mon, Dave, you're never gonna

get that sonofabitch.

FERRIE

No?  It won't be long, mark my words.

That fucker'll get what's coming to

him.  And it can be blamed on Castro.

Then the whole country'll want to

invade Cuba.  All we got to do is

get Kennedy in the open.

BERTRAND

David, David, always some harebrained

scheme or another... Oh?  What do I

see here?  Oooooh, let's have some

more champagne, shall we!

O'KEEFE

(interested in Ferrie's

proposal)

What about the Secret Service, the

cops?

FERRIE

(pacing, hyper)

No problem if it's planned right.

Look how close they got with de

Gaulle.  Eisenhower was always riding

around in an open top.  I know

somebody who actually went up and

touched Eisenhower once.  We need to

have three mechanics at three

different locations.  An office

building with a high-powered rifle.

Triangulation of crossfire is the

key.  You get the diversionary shot

gets the Secret Service looking one

way - Boom!  You get the kill shot.

The crucial thing is one man has to

be sacrificed, then in the commotion

of the crowd the job gets done and

the others fly out of the country to

someplace with no extradition.  I

could do that myself.  I could fly

to Mexico, and then Brazil.

BERTRAND

Why don't we drop this subject...

it's one thing to engage in badinage

with these youngsters, but this sort

of thing could be so easily

misunderstood.

(he squeezes Ferrie)

FERRIE

Ouch!

O'KEEFE (V.O.)

I didn't think much about it at the

time.  Just bullshit, y'know,

everybody likes to make themselves

out to be something more than they

are.  Specially in the homosexual

underworld.  But then when they got

him

(merging to the present)

I got real scared, y'know.  Real

scared.  And that's when I got popped.

JIM

Willie, are you willing to repeat

your statements under sodium

pentothal?  Under the supervision of

a doctor?

O'KEEFE

Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you

can tell'em all I told you so.

JIM

You realize the things you're saying,

Willie, are going to be attacked by

a lot of different people.

O'KEEFE

Bring on all the motherfuckers!

Bring their college degrees in here!

I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't

buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't

even need the parole.  This is about

the truth coming out.  You're a

goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you

don't know shit, cause you never

been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is

here now, Facism is...

JIM

No one's trying to buy you, Willie.

It's important to know why you're

telling us this.

O'KEEFE

(pauses)

You wanna know why?  'Cause that

mother fucker Kennedy stole that

fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon

was gonna be one of the great

Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this

fuckin' country.  Got niggers all

over the fuckin' place asking for

their rights, where do you think we

got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause

Kennedy promised 'em too damned much.

Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming

back.  I tell ya this - the day that

Communist sumbitch died was a great

day for this country.  I jes' hate

to think they're blaming it on some

silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know

shit anyway.  People should know why

that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he

was a Communist.  Put me on the stand,

go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn

story, I'm proud of it, don't matter

fuck all to me, things don't change.

SUSIE

Your hunch was right, boss, but it's

even spookier than we thought.

Starting in September '63 on, two

months before the assassination,

there are sightings of Oswald all

over Dallas, buying ammunition,

getting a telescopic sight fixed,

going to rifle ranges... Early

November, a Dallas downtown Lincoln-

Mercury dealership where he tells

the salesman Albert Bogard...

"OSWALD"

"OSWALD"

(SENSING BOGARD'S HESITANCY)

Hey, I got a lotta money coming in

the next two weeks.

SUSIE (V.O.)

...despite the fact he has no license

and from what marina says, does not

know how to drive, he hits the curves

like Mario Andretti at the Indy 500.

Bogard later told his boss he drove

"like a madman."

BOGARD

Three hundred bucks down, Mr. Oswald,

you can drive outta here with it.

"OSWALD"

Who you kidding!  For this heap?

Forget it...  No honest working man

can afford a car anymore in the

goddamn country!  Maybe I'll have to

go back to Russia to buy a car...

SUSIE (V.O.)

... really dumb dialogue like he's

trying to draw attention to himself.

A real moron.  He walks out.  The

salesman remembers him as about 5'7",

but we know from his draft card he

was about 5'11"...

LOU

...several witnesses see him on

several separate days at different

firing ranges.

LOU

...one time, November 9, he decides

he needs to practice on the target

of the guy next to him.  Says

something really dumb to the guy,

who says Oswald was a great shot.

MAN

Hey, watcha doing, boy... that's my

target.

"OSWALD"

Hey, sorry, buddy.  I just thought

it was that sonofabitch Kennedy,

y'know.  I couldn't help myself.

(laughs)

JIM

(in present)

...about as subtle as a cockroach

crawling across a white rug.

SUSIE

I'll go you one better, Lou.  He

shows up at Silvia Odio's, a Cuban

lady in Dallas working in the anti-

Castro underground - remember that

name, a solid witness.  The two Cubans

introduce him as "Leon Oswald".

SUSIE

...the Cubans want Silvia, whose

parents are political prisoners in

Cuba, to help them raise money to

assassinate Castro.  Something about

the men bothers her.  She tells them

she doesn't want anything to do with

violence... about 48 hours later one

of the Cubans calls her back...

THE BULL

(on the phone, in

Spanish)

This guy Leon Oswald's great, he's

kinda nut...  he told us we don't

any guts, us Cubans, cause Kennedy

should've been whacked after the Bay

of Pigs, and some Cubans should've

done that, it's easy to do, he says -

you know he's a Marine, an expert

shooter...

SUSIE

It's like he's giving her information

she doesn't even ask for.  She's

scared, doesn't see them again till

she sees Oswald's picture in the

paper.  But the Warren Commission

says she has bad eyesight because

they have Oswald in Mexico at this

time, trying to get back into Cuba.

The Cubans think he's a double agent

so they won't take him.  The CIA has

a camera outside the Cuban Embassy

and says this is Oswald in Mexico.

(hands over a picture)

You figure it.

AL

If this is Oswald, it must be our

third Oswald.

JIM

The interesting thing is the extent

to which the Warren Commission went

to make him a Communist.  They got

almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of

the report on this Mexico trip and

the picture doesn't even match.  I'm

beginning to think the point of the

Mexican episode was to lay the blame

at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or

someone purporting to be Oswald, had

gotten into Cuba, come back, then

killed the President, the American

public once again would've screamed

for a Cuban invasion...

SUSIE

I even have doubts about this photo,

boss.  It pretty much convicted Oswald

in the public mind.  Well, according

to Captain Fritz, Oswald told him

during his interrogation the photo

was fake.

OSWALD

That's not me.

FRITZ

It came from Janet William's garage.

OSWALD

Well, I never saw that picture.  It

is my face, but my face has been

super-imposed - the rest of the

picture is not me at all.  I've done

a lot of photographic work, and that

picture was made by someone else.

FRITZ

So who the hell are you?  Alex Hidell

or Oswald?

OSWALD

Well, you're the policeman, you work

it out.

SUSIE

(in the present)

Oswald, who worked for Jaggars-Chiles-

Stovall, did know spy photography

pretty well.  I took this picture to

two experts.  Look at the way the

shadows on the nose fall in a straight

line like it's high noon.  But the

shadow here on the ground reads like

late afternoon or early morning.

It's not the same time.  Also look

at the crop marks across the chin.

It seems like his head is pasted on

somebody else's body implicating him

with this rifle and gun.

SUSIE

And of the two newspapers in his

hands, one is Leninist, the other

Trotskyite.  Any genuine Socialist

would know they hate each other's

politics!

MOBSTER

Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He

comes around the Quarter.

BILL

Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every

bar, no one wants to talk.

MOBSTER

I told your uncle I never met a lawman

who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill,

even if you're family.  He's a big

shot businessman.  I seen him on the

TV news a lot with all the other big

shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by

another name down here.

BILL

(excited)

What's the other name?

MOBSTER

Shaw.  Clay Shaw.

BILL

(stunned)

Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy

who used to run the International

Trade Mart?

MOBSTER

Yeah, what's the big mystery?

Everybody down here knows the guy.

BILL

So why does he call himself Bertrand?

MOBSTER

Who gives a shit what he calls

himself?

SUSIE

...now it gets positively spooky.

In January, 1961 - in New Orleans,

at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when

the Oswald we know is in Russia -

there is a man using the name "Oswald"

to buy trucks for the Friends of

Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never

saw him again, but guess who's on

the articles of incorporation of the

Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy

Banister.

(reactions from the

others)

Banister has someone using the name

"Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover,

at the FBI, writes a memo dated June,

1960, that there could be someone

using Oswald's passport and identity.

JIM

Goddamn!  They put Oswald together

from Day One!  Like some dummy

corporation in the Bahamas - you

just move him around a board.  Sent

him to Russia, in and out, no passport

problems.  You got the word

"microdots" in his notebook, you got

the Minox camera and the electronic

devices they find in his possessions,

the sealed DIZ201 personnel file.

For all we know, there could be a

dozen Oswalds in different cities,

countries - all of them leaving a

trail of incriminating evidence that

could easily be traced to a scapegoat

after the assassination.  Does the

real Oswald know he's been put

together?  Who knows.  It doesn't

matter, does it?  He's a low level

spy, he doesn't know who he really

works for...

(PAUSE)

Let's call it a night.

(to Lou)

Anything new on Ruby?

LOU

Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with

the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief.

I just need 10 more men and some

more dollars.

JIM

I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three

more lectures this month.  You're

all doing an incredible job, Sue,

Al, Numa.  But this is one where if

you don't nail the other guy, you're

dead.

(he pulls a book from

the bookcase for Lou)

How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of

what?  Cancer, right?  A history of

Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying

viral cancers as a weapon in the

30's.  We learned a lot more than

you think from the Nazis.  Read this.

Our biological warfare lab is in

Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to

where the National Cancer Institute

is located.  Think about it.  Think

the unthinkable - question everything.

NUMA

Even my own wife, chief,

(looking at his watch)

Who's wondering where I am?

JIM

(looking at Liz)

Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of

you want to quit, do me a favor...

put us out of our misery.

BILL

I fould Clay Bertrand.

SUSIE

Who?

BILL

Grab your socks and pull... Clay

Bertrand is Clay Shaw...

SUSIE

(stunned)

No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade

Mart?  This is incredible.

NUMA

Pillar of the community by day, gay

bars at night.

JIM

Can you get some sworn statements?

BILL

That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's

talking.

JIM

I think we should have him in for a

little talk.

LIZ

Do you have any evidence against

him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much

for the city with all that restoration

in the Quarter.  He's well connected,

all his friends, the money, people,

be careful, Jim.

JIM

It'll be off the record, honey.

I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A

quiet little chat between gentlemen.

NEWSMAN 10

(announcer)

In heavy fighting in Vietnam today,

seven more American soldiers died

and 23 were wounded.  The body count

for this week now stands at 67

Americans and 626 enemy soldiers

killed in action.

LIZ

Jim, come on, honey, get down on

your hands and knees and hunt for

Jasper's Easter egg.

JIM

You know I don't like these tribal

rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm

interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.

NEWSMAN 10

(as TV cuts to

President Johnson)

President Johnson, meanwhile at an

informal press conference, said he

regretted that there is no end in

sight to the war in Vietnam, where

500,000 American troops are now

fighting.  "We face more cost, more

loss, and more agony."  In his

proposal to raise taxes, Johnson...

LIZ

(surprised)

But Jim, we're going to Antoine's

with the kids - like we do every

year.

JIM

No.  I told you I was going to talk

to Shaw.

LIZ

But why in the Lord's name would you

do it in the middle of Easter Sunday

when you knew we were...

JIM

(annoyed with her

look)

Because when I scheduled it I didn't

realize it was a holiday.  You were

there, why didn't you say something?

LIZ

Look at the calendar, for Christ's

sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter

Sunday.

JIM

I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay

Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.

LIZ

You're missing most of your life,

Jim, and you don't even know it.

The kids are missing out too.

(harder)

It's not just you making the sacrifice

here, honey.

JIM

Look, I'll rush and be there by two,

I promise.  Go ahead without me.

CLAY SHAW

Mr. Garrison - what can I do for you

on Easter Sunday?

JIM

I'm sorry, Mr. Shaw, to interrupt

this holiday, but I feel this is a

conversation we might better have

out of the everyday bustle in this

office...

SHAW

(sitting)

I'm not sure I understand.

JIM

(bringing some papers

forward)

Well... in an investigation we're

conducting your name has come up a

number of times.

SHAW

I wouldn't imagine where.

JIM

We recently talked to a number of

men who claim to know you.  Are you

acquainted with a David Logan?

SHAW

No.  Never heard of him.

JIM

A Perry Russo?

SHAW

No.

JIM

A Willie O'Keefe?

SHAW

No, I don't believe I know anyone by

that name.

JIM

Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at

the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter

and several evenings later you had

him over for dinner at your apartment

on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall

that?

SHAW (V.O.)

(in present)

Of course not.  I don't know this

man.  Obviously then, I wouldn't

have him to dinner.  Incidentally, I

do not live in an apartment.  It's

an 1860's house built by Gallier.

I've restored it faithfully.  You

know I am quite an advocate of

restoration.

JIM (V.O.)

Perhaps a few more details about the

evening will refresh your memory.

Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served

by a uniformed waiter - a colored

man.  He particularly remembers that

you sat at one end and he at the

other - which he found rather unusual

because the table was so long.  Does

that bring back memories of Willie

O'Keefe?

SHAW

(in present)

Not at all.  But on the other hand,

I do have a lovely Chippendale dining

table and I often have a friend over

sitting at one end while I sit at

the other.  That is precisely the

point of a long dining table.  The

splendor of the meal adds to the

enjoyment of it.

JIM

I would imagine a uniformed waiter

helps.

SHAW

It adds a taste of elegance for which

I must confess a weakness for now

and then.  I call him Smedley.  His

real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I

could hardly imagine anything more

uncouth during dinner than my turning

toward the kitchen and hollering

"Frankie!" .. Where is this leading

to, Mr. Garrison?

JIM (V.O.)

After dinner you paid him to have

sex with you.

SHAW (V.O.)

(laughing)

Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The

Quarter is filled with vivid

imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison -

grimy young hoodlums who'll say and

do anything.  As you well know.

JIM (V.O.)

...in the course of that night, Mr.

O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie

stopped by the house... along with

another young man...

SHAW (V.O.)

Who?

JIM (V.O.)

David Ferrie.

SHAW (V.O.)

No.  I have never known anyone by

that name.  Of course never having

met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have

met Mr. Ferrie...

JIM (V.O.)

...and that the four of you partied

early into the morning hours...

FERRIE

(to Shaw)

You're mine, Mary.  Go get the fucking

tools out, bitch.  Now!  I want some

ass.

FERRIE

(to Shaw)

Come here, bitch.

(Ferrie grabs Shaw by

the hair)

You want this?  The only way you get

this is do what I say.

(Ferrie whacks Shaw)

I'm the man.  Don't ever forget it.

(Shaw begs and whines)

You want it?  You want it?

(Ferrie spits on Shaw)

Fuck you and your rich friends.

You're nothing but a rich whore!

You're my woman!  Get the cat!

(to young man)

Strip!  Now, woman.  I want to see

skin.

JIM

(in present)

Let me show you his picture.

(he hands Shaw a

general photo of

Ferrie)

SHAW

(in present)

No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone

of such a bizarre appearance.

JIM

Does the name Clay Bertrand mean

anything to you?

SHAW

Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I

believe there was a man with a name

similar to that who worked at the

Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the

man you had in mind?

JIM

No, it was not.  Do you know an

attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?

SHAW

One meets so many attorneys in my

business.  No, I don't believe I

know Dean Andrews.

SNAPPER

I'm hungry!  When're we gonna eat!

LIZ

We're going to start without him and

he'll be here for dessert.  Snapper,

you put that back!

VIRGINIA

I want a Shirley Temple!

SNAPPER

Me, too.

JASPER

(disappointed)

When's Daddy coming, Mama?

LIZ

Soon.  He's real sorry he can't start

with us but he's promised to be here.

JIM

(handing a photo to

Shaw)

Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?

SHAW

Naturally.

(he looks up)

Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that

Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?

JIM

(humorless)

Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey

Oswald?

SHAW

You really have me consorting with a

cast of sordid characters, don't

you, Mr. Garrison.

JIM

Please answer the question.

SHAW

Of course not!  Such a pity, that

assassination.  In fact, I admired

President Kennedy.  A man with true

panache, and a wife with impeccable

taste.

JIM

Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper

article saying you were a member of

the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale

in Italy, that this company was a

creature of the CIA for the transfer

of funds in Italy for illegal

political-espionage activities.  It

says that this company was expelled

from Italy for those activities.

SHAW

I'm well aware of this asinine

article.  And I am thinking very

seriously of suing this rag of a

newspaper.

JIM

It says that this company has heavily

Fascist ties to the French secret

army organization that tried to

assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.

SHAW

Nonsense.  What next?

JIM

...and that this company is linked

to the Schlumber tool company here

in Houma, Louisiana - which is where

their arms may have come from to

David Ferrie and his Cubans...

SHAW

Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am

an international businessman.  The

Trade Mart which I founded is

America's commercial pipeline to

Latin America.  I trade everywhere.

I am accused, as are all businessmen,

of all things.  I somehow go about

my business, make money, help society

the best I can and try to promote

free trade in this world.

JIM

Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a

contract agent with the Central

Intelligence Agency?

SHAW

(with powerful contempt)

And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you

think I would be here today... talking

to somebody like you?

JIM

No, people like you don't have to, I

guess - people like you walk between

the raindrops.

SHAW

(rising)

May I go?  Regardless of what you

may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am

a patriot first and foremost.

JIM

I've spent half my life in the United

States military serving and defending

this great country, Mr. Shaw, and

you're the first person I ever met

who considered it an act of patriotism

to kill his own president.

SHAW

Now just a minute, sir!  You're way

out of line!

BILL

Come on, chief.

(as he shows Shaw to

the door)

I'm sorry, Mr. Shaw, it's getting

late.  That's all the questions we

have.  Thank you for your honesty

and for coming in today.

SHAW

I enjoyed meeting with you gentlemen,

and you, Miss Cox.  It was most

pleasant.  I wish to extend to each

of you - and to each of your families -

my best wishes for a happy Easter.

(he exits.)

JIM

(beat, excited)

"One may smile and smile and be a

villain."  Goddammit!  We got one of

'em!

JASPER

Daddy!  Where have you been?

JIM

(kisses Liz)

Hi, Freckle Face.

LIZ

(seething)

Hi.

JIM

Tough day.

LIZ

My sympathies.

JIM

Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting

went much longer than expected.

LIZ

We waited for you... hours, Jim.

You could have telephoned, for God's

sake.  It's Easter!  You promised,

Jim.

JIM

I don't know what to say except I'm

sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on

my mind.

LIZ

I think you care more about John

Kennedy than your family!  All day

long the kids are asking, "Where's

Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell

your kids, Jim!

JIM

I don't know what to tell them.  How

'bout the truth - I'm doing my job

to make sure they can grow up in a

country where justice won't be an

arcane, vanished idea they read about

in history books, like the dinosaurs

or the lost continent of Atlantis.

LIZ

That sounds dandy, but it doesn't

replace a father and a husband on

Easter Day.

JIM

(angry, turns away)

It's going to get worse, honey.

LOU

Congratulations, Boss - you're page

one!

JIM

(striding into his

office reading the

paper)

Goddamn Sam!

LOU

And it ain't pretty

(reading the copy)

..."the AD has spent more than $8,000

on unexplained travel and

investigative expenses since November,

1966.

NUMA

They went to the public records and

got the vouchers we requested for

withdrawals.

SUSIE

Shaw must've gotten them on our tail.

AL

Could be Ferrie, Martin, Andrews,

any of 'em.

BILL

We didn't talk to Ruby 'cause of

them and they're on our asses for a

measly $8,000!

JIM

They hunted down the news, it's their

business.  Getting angry doesn't

accomplish a damned thing, but this

changes everything.  We either pull

out now or we go through some heavy

flack together.

JIM

Bear in mind, each of you, this may

affect the rest of your careers,

your lives...

(pause)

...if any of you pull out, I assure

you I will bear no ill feelings

towards that person and will reassign

you to regular duties.

JIM

There it is then.  Thank you.  It

means very much to me.  I'm giving

this office $6,000 from my National

Guard savings so we can continue.  I

will make speeches where I can to

pick up additional money.  Some local

businessmen are putting together a

fund for us and...

SHARON

(coming in)

Mr. Garrison, what shall I tell them?

They're piling up outside the door.

They want a statement, the phones

are going crazier than bugs on a

cake.

JIM

Neither confirm, deny, nor discuss,

Sharon.  Goodbye, ladies, gentlemen,

I'm going home where I can get a

decent day's work done.

NEWSMAN 11

(editorial)

Mr. Garrison's own silence on the

subject has raised some interesting

questions.  With taxpayer money has

he uncovered some valuable new

evidence or is he merely saving the

information which will gain for him

exposure on a national level?  Mr.

Garrison it seems, should have some

explanation.

LOU

Yeah?

DAVE FERRIE (V.O.)

(very agitated)

Did your office plant that garbage

in the fucking paper?

LOU

Who is this?

FERRIE (V.O.)

You know damn well who it is.

LOU

Dave?

FERRIE (V.O.)

Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the

only straight shooter in that fuckin'

office, I'd like an answer from you.

Did you plant it?

LOU

Dave, do you think we're out of our

minds?  The whole building's been a

zoo since that broke.  We can't get

a thing done.  Reporters crawling

everywhere.  You think we want that?

FERRIE

(yelling)

Somebody planted that fucking story!

And somebody tipped off the press

I'm one of Garrison's fucking

suspects.  I can't go home.

I'm out on the street.  The maggots

are everywhere!  Do you know what

you've done to me?  It's all over

the national news now.  You know

what you've done to me?

LOU

Calm down, Dave, what?

FERRIE

I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe

me, I'm a dead man.

LOU

What are you talking about, Dave?

You weren't mentioned in the story.

Don't jump to conclusions.

FERRIE

You think your investigation's been

all that secret?  You know, when you

talk to people, they talk to other

people.

LOU

What did they...

FERRIE

You still questioning any Cubans?

LOU

Dave, you know that's where this

road leads.

FERRIE

It leads farther than that.

LOU

Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in

the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20

minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved

for you under an assumed name.

FERRIE

(unsure)

The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?

LOU

(hopeful)

Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our

side.  I guarantee you the boss'll

protect you...

(there's a long silence

as Ferrie, torn,

agonizes)

Dave?

FERRIE

(dreamy)

...give me protection?

LOU

Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He

likes you.  Your mind.

FERRIE

I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet

you in 20 minutes.

KING

(on TV)

President Kennedy said on one

occasion, "Mankind must put an end

to war, or war will put an end to

mankind."  I pray God that America

will hear this before it's too late,

because today we're fighting a war

I'm convinced is one of the most

unjust wars that has ever been fought

in the history of the world.

LIZ

(on the phone

meanwhile, testy)

No, he's not here now.  And he would

not take calls here if he were!  So

please call the office number.  Thank

you.

(hangs up)

Two of them even had the gall to

come to the door this afternoon, one

all the way from England.

JIM

Did they live?

LIZ

It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.

JIM

Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about,

honey, I been through four years of

war - this is nothing.

KING

(on TV)

...sending them 8,000 miles away to

guarantee liberties in Southeast

Asia which they have not found in

Southwest Georgia or East Harlem.

So we have been repeatedly faced

with the cruel irony of watching

Negro and white boys on TV screens

as they kill and die for a nation

that has been unable to seat them

together in the same school.

LIZ

I haven't, Jim.

JIM

Nothing is going to happen to you.

I won't let it.

LIZ

Leave us ALONE for God's sake!

(recognizes the voice)

...Oh, it's Lou.

FERRIE

I'm caught in the middle.  They're

after me.  It's almost over.

LOU

Listen, Dave, why don't we order

some room service, have a bite, relax.

I'll stay as long as you want.

FERRIE

I don't know who to trust anymore.

Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot

coffee and a few packs of Camels.

You got anything new in the

investigation?

JIM

You mean about the Cubans getting

trained north of the lake?

FERRIE

(incoherent)

Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet

project.  Getting paid by the

government to work against the

government.  Beautiful.  What a mind

he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all

those files.

JIM

Who was paying you, Dave?

FERRIE

You think I was a getaway pilot for

the assassination, don't you?

JIM

I don't know.  Were you?

(Dave laughs)

Who you scared of, Dave?

FERRIE

Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob.

The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans.

Check them out.  Here, in Dallas,

Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio

del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew

missions into Cuba - he's somewhere

in Miami.  You're on the right track.

FERRIE

Hold it!  Hold it!  I'm not

cooperating with anyone.  There's a

death warrant for me, don't you get

it?  Wait a minute.  You're not

bugged, are you?

LOU

Dave, I always play square.  No bugs.

I'd love you to go on the record,

but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're

ready.

FERRIE

(checking the room)

I don't have much time.  They don't

even need bugs anymore.  They got

these fuckin' satellite waves.  They

put a bug in a friend of mine when

he was born, right up his nostrils,

subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He

was one of those products of a

crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi

rocket scientist father and a Commie

spy mother.  You'd never believe

half the shit the Agency does.

(holding his neck)

I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept

since that shit article came out.

Why'd you guys have to go and get me

involved with this?

LOU

Did we involve you, Dave, or did

Clay Shaw?

FERRIE

That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got

me by the balls.

LOU

What do you mean?

FERRIE

Photographs - compromising stuff.

And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays

for keeps...

(checks the room for

bugs)

I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil

Air Patrol unit.  I taught him

everything.  A "wanna be," y'know,

nobody really liked him cause he was

a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd

talk about his kid, y'know, really

wanted her to grow up with a chance,

but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency

fucked him.  Just like they're gonna

fuck me.

JIM

Let me get this straight, now.  Clay

Shaw is blackmailing you?

FERRIE

Fuckin' A.  How do you think the

Agency gets people to do their

bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got

on Oswald!

FERRIE

Who is it?

BELLHOP (V.O.)

Room service.

JIM

Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that

was in Dallas, or was it an

impersonator.

FERRIE

Same one.  I didn't know no

impersonator.

JIM

Did you take a good look at the TV

when they had Oswald?

FERRIE

(shrugs, can't be

bothered)

Black, black - just give it to me.

(takes the fresh coffee

from Lou, lights a

Camel)

Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is

killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had

it for years.  I been working with

mice, y'know, trying to come up with

a cure.

JIM

Dave, can I just ask you this

directly?  Did you ever work for the

CIA?

FERRIE

(laughs)

You make it sound like some remote

fuckin' experience in ancient history.

Man, you never leave the Agency.

Once they got you, you're in for

life.

JIM

And Shaw?

FERRIE

Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest

clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans -

all Agency.

JIM

What about Ruby?

FERRIE

Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in

Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run

guns to Castro when he was still on

our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood.

Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then

we tried to whack him.  Everybody's

flipping sides all the time.  It's

fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.

LOU

What about the mob, Dave?  How do

they figure in this?

FERRIE

They're Agency, too.  Don't you get

it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying

to whack out the Beard.  Mutual

interests.  They been doing it for

years.  There's more to this than

you dream.  FBI fucking hates the

CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something

to do with it too.  Check out "Alan

Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood.

Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The

shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop -

the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard

he shot his own partner.  Got that?

Check out the rich fucks in Dallas.

H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all

I know.  But the Agency always runs

the show.  Check out something called

"Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose.

Government, Pentagon stuff, they're

in charge, but who the fuck pulls

whose chain who the fuck knows, fun

'n' games man - check out Southeast

Asia - that's the next big number -

the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly

web we weave when we practice to

deceive."

JIM

Then who killed the President?

FERRIE

Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is

too fuckin' big for you!  Who did

Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in

a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the

shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't

you get it yet?  I can't be talking

like this.  They're gonna kill me.

I'm gonna die!

(he sits down,

cracking, sobbing)

I don't know what happened.  All I

wanted in the world was to be a

Catholic priest - live in a monastery,

study ancient Latin manuscripts,

pray, serve God.  But I had this one

terrible, fatal weakness.  They

defrocked me.  And then I started to

lose everything.

FERRIE

Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin'

rug today.  You know, at one time I

even had a full head of hair like

everyone else.  And then I lost that.

That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the

bastard.  All I got left is in his

rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the

newspapers - I know it.  That's how

the Agency works.  They use people,

chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now

it's my turn.

JIM

(empathetic)

Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just

talk to us on the record and we'll

protect you.  I guarantee it.

FERRIE

They'll get to you, too - they'll

destroy you... They're untouchable,

man...

(then)

I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see

straight.

JIM

Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel

better in the morning.  We'll talk

then.

FERRIE

Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for

awhile.  I got to make some calls.

LOU

Whatever you say, Dave.  I'll be

home.  Okay?

Coming through, out of the way.

RECEPTIONIST

You know who killed the President?

Mr. Garrison is busy but his

assistant...

BILL BROUSSARD'S OFFICE

A man with the demeanor of Julius

Caesar walks into Bill's office.

CAESAR

(raising arm)

Hail!  Et tu, Brutus?

BILL

And you, too, my friend.

JIM GARRISON'S OFFICE

Numa joins Jim with a stack of new

mail.

NUMA

Love a duck!  It takes twenty minutes

to get into this office these days.

Are we famous or what?

JIM

Notorious is more like it.  "Jim

Garrison is right.  There has been a

conspiracy in New Orleans - but it's

a plot of Garrison's own making"...

and this - "one of the D.A.'s

investigators offered an unwilling

witness $3000 if only he would fill

in the facts of the alleged meeting

to plot the death of the President"...

How can they write that?  Where did

they come up with this? ...

(sorting through others)

"A charlatan," "power-mad," a "hulking

D.A."

(New York Post)

"Morbid Frolic in New Orleans."

BILL

The crazies have taken over the

asylum!  It's a zoo out there.

NUMA

Sensational garbage sells newspapers,

Jim.  What else is new?  Look at the

thousands of letters you're getting.

That's where the heart of the country

is.

(reads from one)

"Dear Mr. Garrison, God bless you

for having the courage to go after

the murderers of President Kennedy.

Please don't stop till they're behind

bars.  I am a beautician here in

Hannibal, Missouri, and my husband

is a janitor in the local high school.

We have four kids and not an extra

lot of money but we enclose a

contribution to help with your work.

We are praying for you.  God bless,

Judith Hardy, Hannibal, Missouri."

NUMA

That's what it's about, boss.  For

every lousy article in the press

there's a hundred of these.

BILL

That's fine, Numa, but what about

all the people who aren't writing

letters.  They're sitting home reading

all these lies.  I just heard NBC

crew's in town to do a "White Paper" -

not on the Kennedy killing, but on

us.  One of their top guys, Harry

Stoner, is talking to everybody he

can find about you, boss...

JIM

Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he

call me?

NUMA

(to Bill)

What do you want to do, Bill - fold

up and close the store?  You sound

like it.

BILL

Look, this is bigger than all of us.

We can't try a case in this

atmosphere.

SHARON

Mr. Miller's been waiting.

JIM

(remembering)

Oh!  Send him in.

(to Numa)

Denver oilman wants to support the

investigation.

(specifically to Bill)

Bill, I know what you're thinking,

but sometimes when it makes no sense

that's exactly when you just gotta

stick to it, head down.

JIM

Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison.

Would you care for some coffee?

MILLER

Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your

coffee's almost Turkish down here

but I could get used to it.

MILLER

I'm glad you could find time to see

me.  I flew down from Denver this

morning on my private jet.

JIM

Yes, your letter indicated you were

in he oil business up there.

MILLER

I've done quite well in Denver, Mr.

Garrison, but I have to admire someone

like you - and I have the means to

back up what I say.

JIM

We can use all the support we can

get.  I think these might interest

you.

JIM

They've been enlarged and show a lot

of detail...

MILLER

Splendid, love to see them.

MILLER

Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?

JIM

Germany.

MILLER

You were lucky.  I spent three years

in the Pacific.

(he looks out the

blinds at Tulane

Avenue)

I've never seen an avenue with such

a profusion of bail-bonding companies.

Why is that?

JIM

(nettled by Miller's

moving around)

I imagine because this is the Criminal

District Court Building

(showing a photo)

This is an enlargement of a potential

shooter standing behind the picket

fence.  We...

MILLER

I know about that shot.  A terrible

tragedy.

(Puts the photo back

on the desk)

How much do you have for carrying on

your investigation?

JIM

If you must know, virtually nothing.

MILLER

How many men are working with you on

this?

JIM

Less than you would guess.  Most

days two to three assistant D.A.'s.

A handful of police investigators.

MILLER

That's all you've had all this time?

JIM

That's it.

MILLER

I admire you, Mr. Garrison.  How did

you manage to make your way into Guy

Banister's operation?

JIM

That was never in he newspapers, Mr.

Miller.

MILLER

I'm going to be very frank with you.

You've done a great job, an astounding

job considering the limited resources

available to you.  But the best you

can ever hope for is to stir up a

lot of confusion.  You're not going

to do this country any good, and

you're not going to do yourself any

good.

(he sits back down

and looks directly

at Jim)

You don't belong here.  On this Mickey

Mouse street with that cheap strip

of bail bond shops.

JIM

The job manages to keep me pretty

busy.

MILLER

Nonsense.  You should be in a job

where you can make decisions that

have impact, affect the world.  Here

you're trying to climb up the steep

side of Mount Everest.

MILLER

I propose you accept an appointment

to the bench in Federal District

Court and move into a job worthy of

your talent.

(he leans back and

pauses)

Do you have any idea, do you have

any conception of how easily such an

appointment can be arranged?

JIM

And what would I have to do?

MILLER

Stop your investigation... it was a

magnificent effort but it's over and

done with.  The press is already on

your behind and that's only the

beginning, my boy, only the beginning.

JIM

How long do you think it would take

me to be appointed?

MILLER

(smiling, thinking

Jim is hooked)

Well, ordinarily these things take a

long time.  But in your case, with

your record it can be expedited -

easily.  I guarantee it.

JIM

Who are you, Mr. Miller?

(no answer - just the

sound of the overhead

fan)

You see that helmet over there?

(the Nazi helmet with

a bullet hole on his

desk)

I picked that up at the Dachau

concentration camp when we liberated

it in 1945.  It was the most

horrifying sight I've ever seen, Mr.

Miller.  Pyramids of decaying,

stinking bones and skin one on top

of the other.  I don't enjoy looking

at that swastika every day, Mr.

Miller, but I keep it there to remind

me of what can happen when a country

turns from free democratic principles

to Fascism, when a few madmen turn

human beings into digits and millions

sit in silence and do nothing about

it.

JIM

Mr. Miller, you and I have met under

a great misunderstanding.  I haven't

the remotest interest in becoming a

Federal Judge.  And nothing is going

to keep me from going ahead with my

investigation of John Kennedy's

murder.

JIM

Bill, Mr. Miller and I have finished

our conversation.  Would you show

him out?

JIM

Those bastards!  That's proof enough

right there of what we're up against.

The whole goddamn Federal Government,

Bill!

BILL

Well, they offered you the carrot,

and you turned it down... you know

what's coming next, don't you, boss?

LOU

Boss, I tell you something or somebody

is putting tremendous heat on David

Ferrie.  If we sit on our behinds

any longer, I don't think the guy's

going to hold on.

SUSIE

(raps the newspaper)

Look at this bullshit!  He keeps

changing what he says.  We can't

possibly call him to a Grand Jury.

JIM

Susie, watch the language, would you

please.

AL

My instinct is that Ferrie is going

to keep on deteriorating, and we'll

end up getting more out of him when

he finally cracks.  If we call him

now, he might freeze up and we could

lose the best shot we've ever had.

LOU

You don't get it, guys - he can't go

down any further.  We got to protect

him full time.

JIM

(rises, looks at his

watch)

I have a plane to catch... going to

Washington.  An interesting lead,

says he's closely connected to these

events, but he won't come down here...

I know what you're going through

with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk

tomorrow.

LOU

I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster,

Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta

get him in, boss.  I need more men -

I can't even pull the teams to watch

Ferrie... This is our case!

NUMA

HOLD IT, CHIEF...

JIM

(to Lou)

You just need some sleep, Lou.  It

won't look so bad when...

GARRISON'S MAIN OFFICE

The staff comes out into the office

with Him, disturbed.

JIM

What the hell is...

NUMA

Williams found this in your office...

We think the conference room is also

bugged.  And maybe the phones.  The

whole place needs debugging.

JIM

I don't believe it!

SUSIE

Bugging the District Attorney's office

of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!

SHARON

It's urgent for you, Mr. Ivon.

NUMA

Well, believe what you want, boss,

but we got to be more careful.  All

these new volunteers, any one of

them could be...

JIM

Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't

have time for this nonsense.

(to the hidden mikes

loudly)

We've obviously got the bastards

worried now.  I'm going to Washington.

LOU

Dave Ferrie's dead.  The body was

found at his apartment two hours

ago.

JIM

(to chief police

officer)

This case is in our jurisdiction.  I

don't want anyone from a Federal

agency in here without an explicit

Federal court order.  You got that,

Hank?

(Hank looks at him

weirdly)

NEWSMAN 10

Was Ferrie murdered, Mr. Garrison?

Do you have any leads?

JIM

What's it look like, Nick?

CORONER

I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart

attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks

like natural causes.

BILL

It's addressed to no one and no

signature.  "To leave this life is,

for me, a sweet prospect.  I find

nothing in it that is desirable and

on the other hand, everything that

is loathsome."

LOU

Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.

FERRIE'S BEDROOM

Jim hands Lou the medicine bottle.

LOU

Proloid?

JIM

I took it once for a low thyroid

condition...

(he walks away)

It raises the metabolism, Lou.

(pause)

Did David Ferrie strike you as the

kind of person who had a low

metabolism?

LOU

I'd say the opposite - hypertension.

JIM

Ferrie was the only one to express

some kind of remorse about this whole

thing.  I think it got him killed.

SUSIE

Boss, we just got bad news from Miami.

They found Ferrie's Cuban friend -

Eladio del Valle - this morning,

hacked to death with a machete in

his car.  He was tortured, shot in

the heart at point-blank range and

his skull was split open with an

axe...

LOU

Jesus - if that ain't the Devil's

piss!  Those bastards!

BILL

Found another note, same thing, no

name, no signature.  "When you receive

this, I will be quite dead, so no

answer will be possible.  I offered

you love.  All I got in return in

the end was a kick in the teeth."

JIM

Jesus, they must've been hard pressed

to come up with that one.

JIM

(gives the coroner

the empty bottle)

Nick, what would happen if a man

suffering from hypertension were to

take an entire bottle of Proloid?

CORONER

He'd die pretty quick, either a heart

storm or a ruptured blood vessel in

the brain.

JIM

Can you ascertain if there's Proloid

in his system?

CORONER

Not in a routine autopsy, but if we

looked at the spinal fluid, there

might be a high level of iodine, but

it's difficult to know.  Whatcha

thinkin', Jim?

JIM

Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick -

he was afraid of dying, then he kills

himself in a way that leaves no trace,

but he leaves two unsigned suicide

notes.

CORONER

(shrugs, skeptical)

If it's a suicide, I seen weirder,

Jim.

(exits)

BILL

The fact is he's gone, chief, and

so's our case.

LOU

Not unless we go for Shaw now.

BILL

With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe?

A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A

drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend.

Shaw's got respect, the newspaper

editors, the American Bar Association -

they're not...

SUSIE

I'm afraid I'm with Bill on this

one.  We haven't got the goods yet.

LOU

We wait, Shaw's gonna get whacked.

Oswald, Ruby, Ferrie, del Valle,

Banister, Bowers...  how many corpses

you lawyers gotta see to figure out

what's going on?

JIM

All right, all right.  Break it up.

BILL

Where you going, boss?

JIM

I don't know, Bill, I just don't

know.

FRANK

Bill.

BILL

Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're

wasting your time here.  Big Jim

gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.

FRANK

It's you I want to talk to, Bill.

BILL

(laughs)

Boss would fry me in hog fat if he

knew...

(motions to car)

FRANK

(getting in the car)

Your boss got a serious problem,

Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's

been going on at your office

BILL

(smiles)

Yeah, I guess you do.

FRANK

You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking

as a friend now.  You're riding on

the Titanic.  Time to jump off before

you get destroyed along with Garrison.

BILL

Frank, I don't want to hear it.

FRANK

Senator Long set your boss up, my

friend.

FRANK

Who do you think fed him that

information?  Garrison's going down.

We're talking your career here, Bill,

your life.  You're a young guy... we

know you're working that Castro thing.

BILL

No, I'm not...

FRANK

Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald

didn't pull that trigger.  Castro

did.  But if that comes out, there's

gonna be a war, boy - millions of

people are gonna die.  That's a hell

of a lot more important than Jim

Garrison.

(suddenly)

Goddammit, look at me when I talk to

you!  You're too goddamn self-

opinionated, now shut up.  If you

got a brain in that thick skull of

yours, listen to me.  Listen real

hard.

X

Jim Garrison?

JIM

Yes.

X

(shakes hands)

I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about

the precautions.

JIM

Well, I just hope it was worth my

while, Mr...

X

I could give you a false name, but I

won't.  Just call me X.

JIM

I've already been warned by the

Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is

another type of threat, I don't...

X

I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison,

and I assume if you've come this

far, what I have to say interests

you.  But I'm not going to name names,

or tell you who or what I represent.

Except to say - you're close, you're

closer than you think...

X

Everything I'm going to tell you is

classified top secret...

(significant look)

I was a soldier, Mr. Garrison.  Two

wars.  I was one of those secret

guys in the Pentagon that supplies

the military hardware - the planes,

bullets, rifles - for what we call

"black operations" - "black ops",

assassinations, coup d'etats, rigging

elections, propoganda, psych warfare

and so forth.  World War II - Rumania,

Greece, Yugoslavia, I helped take

the Nazi intelligence apparatus out

to help us fight the Communists.

Italy '48 stealing elections, France

'49 breaking strikes - we overthrew

Quirino in the Philippines, Arbenz

in Guatemala, Mossadegh in Iran.

Vietnam in '54, Indonesia '58, Tibet

'59 we got the Dalai Lama out - we

were good, very good.  Then we got

into the Cuban thing.  Not so good.

Set up all the bases for the invasion

supposed to take place in October

'62.  Khrushchev sent the missiles

to resist the invasion, Kennedy

refused to invade and we were standing

out there with our dicks in the wind.

Lot of pissed-off people, Mr.

Garrison, you understand?  I'll come

to that later... I spent much of

September '63 working on the Kennedy

plan for getting all U.S.  personnel

out of Vietnam by the end of '65.

This plan was one of the strongest

and most important papers issued

from the Kennedy White House.  Our

first 1,000 troops were ordered home

for Christmas.  Tensions were high.

In November '63, one week after the

murder of Vietnamese President Diem

in Saigon, and two weeks before the

assassination of our President...

X

...a strange thing happened.  I was

sent by my superior officer, call

him Y, to the South Pole as the

military escort for a group of

international VIP's.  This trip had

nothing to do with my nine years of

work in Special Operations.  It was

sort of a "paid vacation".

X

It wasn't until I was on my way back

in New Zealand that I read of the

President's murder.  That was 2 in

the afternoon the next day New Zealand

time, but already the papers had the

entire history of an unknown 24-year-

old man, Oswald - a studio picture,

detailed biographical data, Russian

information - and were pretty sure

of the fact he'd killed the President

alone, although it took them four

more hours to charge him with the

murder in Texas.  It felt as if,

well, a cover story was being put

out like we would in a black op.

X

Anyway, after I came back I asked

myself why was I, the chief of special

ops, selected to travel to the South

Pole at that time to do a job that

any number of others could have done?

One of my routine duties if I had

been in Washington would've been to

arrange for additional security in

Texas.  The Secret Service is

relatively small, and by custom the

military will augment them.  I checked

it out when I got back and sure

enough, I found out someone had told

the 112th Military Intelligence Group

at 4th Army Headquarters at Fort Sam

Houston to "stand down" that day,

over the protests of the unit

Commander, a Colonel Reich...

X

Now this is significant, because it

is standard operating procedure,

especially in a known hostile city

like Dallas, to supplement the Secret

Service.  Even if we had not allowed

the bubbletop to be removed from the

limousine, we'd've put at least 100

to 200 agents on the sidewalks,

without question!  There'd already

been several attempts on de Gaulle's

life in France.  Only a month before

in Dallas UN Ambassador Adlai

Stevenson had been spit on and hit.

We'd have arrived days ahead of time,

studied the route, checked all the

buildings...

We never would've allowed all those

wide-open empty windows overlooking

Dealey... never...  We would have

had our own snipers covering the

area.  The moment a window went up

they'd have been on the radio.  We

would've been watching the crowds -

packages, rolled up newspapers, a

coat over an arm, never would have

let a man open an umbrella along the

way - Never would've allowed that

limousine to slow down to 10 miles

per hour, much less take that unusual

curve at Houston and Elm.  You would

have felt an Army presence in the

streets that day, but none of this

happened.  It was a violation of the

most basic protection codes we have.

And it is the best indication of a

massive plot in Dallas.  Who could

have best done that?  People in my

business, Mr. Garrison.  People like

my superior officer could've told

Col. Reich, "Look - we have another

unit coming from so and so providing

security.  You'll stand down."  That

day, in fact, there were some

individual Army Intelligence people

in Dallas and I'm still trying to

figure out who and why.  But they

weren't protecting the client.  One

of them, by the way, was caught in

the Book Depository after police

sealed it off.

X

Army Intell had a "Harvey Lee Oswald"

on file, but all those files have

been destroyed.  Many strange things

were happening that day, and Lee

Harvey Oswald had nothing to do with

them.  We had the entire Cabinet on

a trip to the Far East.  We had a

third of a combat division returning

from Germany in the air above the

United States at the time of the

shooting, and at 12:34 P.M., the

entire telephone system went dead in

Washington for a solid hour, and on

the plane back to Washington, word

was radioed from the White House

Situation Room to Lyndon Johnson

that one individual performed the

assassination.  Does that sound like

a bunch of coincidences to you, Mr.

Garrison?  Not for one moment.  The

cabinet was out of the country to

get their perception out of the way.

The troops were in the air for

possible riot control.  The phones

didn't work to keep the wrong stories

from spreading if anything went wrong

with the plan.  Nothing was left to

chance.  I bet you there were even

backup teams and cars on the other

side of the underpass in the event

that Kennedy got through wounded.

They would have moved in with vehicles

like they did with de Gaulle.  He

could not be allowed to escape alive.

X

I never though things were the same

after that.  Vietnam started for

real.  There was an air of, I don't

know, make-believe in the Pentagon

and the CIA.  Those of us who'd been

in secret ops since the beginning

knew the Warren Commission was

fiction, but there was something...

deeper, uglier.  And I knew Allen

Dulles very well.  I briefed him

many a time in his house.  He was

also General Y's benefactor.  But

for the life of me I still can't

figure out why Dulles was appointed

to investigate Kennedy's death.  The

man who had fired him.  I got out in

'64.  I retired from the U.S. Air

Force.

JACKIE KENNEDY

I never realized Kennedy was so

dangerous to the establishment.  Is

that why?

X

(chuckles)

That's the real question, isn't it -

"Why?" - the "how" is just "scenery"

for the suckers...  Oswald, Ruby,

Cuba, Mafia, it keeps people guessing

like a parlor game, but it prevents

them from asking the most important

question - Why?  Why was Kennedy

killed?  Who benefitted?  Who has

the power to cover it up?... You

know in '61 right after the Bay of

Pigs - very few people know about

this - I participated in drawing up

National Security Action Memos 55,

56, and 57.  These are crucial

documents, classified top secret,

but basically in them Kennedy

instructs General Lemnitzer, Chairman

of the Joint Chiefs, that from here

on forward...

X

... the Joint Chiefs of Staff would

be wholly responsible for all covert

paramilitary action in peacetime.

This basically ended the reign of

the CIA - "splintered it", as J.F.K.

promised he would, into a "thousand

pieces", - and now was ordering the

military to help.  This was

unprecedented.  I can't tell you the

shock waves this sent along the

corridors of power in Washington.

This and, of course, firing Allen

Dulles, Richard Bissell, and General

Charles Cabell, all of them sacred

cows of Intell since World War II.

You got some very upset people here.

X

Kennedy's directives were never really

implemented, because of bureaucratic

resistance, but one of the results

was that the Cuban operation was

turned over to my department as

"Operation Mongoose", which meant

that people like my superior officer,

General Y, took over the Cuban

personnel that were being trained to

invade Cuba - and the bases like the

training camp at Pontchartrain in

your home state that were closed

down by Kennedy... and that's how

the "black ops" people, people like

General Y, ended up taking the rules

of covert warfare they'd used abroad

and brought'em into this country.

Now they had the people, the

equipment, bases and the motivation...

check out an old CIA man, Bill Harvey -

ran something called "Executive

Action", which carried out foreign

assassinations.  Harvey was also

involved with the fake defection

program that got Oswald into Russia.

Check out the Cabell brothers.

Interesting links to this case.

X

...don't underestimate the budget

cuts Kennedy called for in March of

'63 either - close to 52 military

installations in 25 states, 21

overseas bases, you're talking big

money.  You know how many helicopters

have been lost in Vietnam?  About

three thousand so far.  Who makes

them?  Bell Helicopter.  Who owns

Bell?  Bell was near bankruptcy when

the First National Bank of Boston

approached the CIA about developing

the helicopter for Indochina usage.

How 'bout the f-111 fighters?  General

Dynamics in Fort Worth.  Who owns

that?  Find out the defense budget

since the war began.  $75 going on a

hundred billion ... $200 billion'll

be spent before it ends.  In 1950 it

was $13 billion.  No war, no money.

Sometimes I think the organizing

principle of any society is for war.

The authority of the state over it's

people resides in it's war powers.

Even Eisenhower - military hero of

WWII - warned us about it: "beware

the military - industrial complex",

he said.  Kennedy wanted to end the

Cold War in his second term.  He

wanted to call of the moon race in

favor of cooperation with the Soviets.

He signed a treaty with the Soviets

to ban nuclear testing, he refused

to invade Cuba in '62, and he set

out to withdraw from Vietnam.  But

that all ended on November 22, 1963.

X

Only four days after J.F.K. was shot,

Lyndon Johnson signed National

Security Memo 273, which essentially

reversed Kennedy's new withdrawal

policy and gave the green light to

the covert operations against North

Vietnam that provoked the Gulf of

Tonkin incident.  In that document

lay the Vietnam War.

JIM

I don't... I can't believe it.  They

killed him because he wanted to change

things.  In our time - in our country?

X

(shrugging)

Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison.

Politics is power, nothing more.

But don't believe me.  Don't trust

me.  Do your own work, your own

thinking.

JIM

The size of this is... beyond me.

Testify?

X

No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison.

I'd be arrested and gagged, declared

insane and hospitalized... maybe

worse.  You, too.  I can only give

you background, you got to find the

foreground, the little things...

Keep digging.  Y'know you're the

only person to ever bring a trial in

the murder of John Kennedy.  That's

important - it's historic.

JIM

I haven't yet.  I don't have much of

a case.

X

(rising to leave)

But you don't have a choice anymore.

You've become a significant threat

to the national security structure.

They would've killed you already,

but you got a lot of light on you.

Instead, they're gonna destroy your

credibility; they already have in

many circles in this town.  You're

some kinda ego-crazed southern

caricature to many folks.  Be honest -

the best chance you got is come up

with a case, something, anything,

make arrests, stir the shitstorm.

You gotta hope to reach a point of

critical mass where other people

will come forward and the government

will crack.  Remember, fundamentally

people are suckers for the truth,

and the truth is on your side, 'bubba.

I hope you get a break...

LOU

Mr. Shaw, you're under arrest, charged

with conspiracy and entering into an

agreement with other persons for the

specific purpose of committing the

crime of murder of President John F.

Kennedy in violation of...

LOU

...we have a warrant to search the

premises.

INSIDE SHAW'S HOUSE

In the bedroom, Numa points out to

Jim the hooks screwed into the

ceiling.  Al pulls out five whips,

several lengths of chain, a black

hood and matching black cape.  Dried

blood is on one whip.

NUMA

It's either a Mardi Gras outfit, or

we got the Marquis de Sade here,

chief.

JIM

I don't care if he was doing it with

giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none

of our business.  Let's keep this

side of it quiet, shall we?

AL

When you're in a war, boss, you use

every weapon you got.

JIM

Not one word.  That's an order.

OFFICER

Name?  First, middle, last.

SHAW

Clay Lavergne Shaw.

OFFICER HABIGHORST

Address?

SHAW

1313 Dauphine, New Orleans.

OFFICER HABIGHORST

Ever use any aliases?

SHAW

Clay Bertrand.

OFFICER HABIGHORST

Next of kin?

NEWSMAN 12

Mr. Shaw - What do you have to say?

ATTORNEY GENERAL

Yes, Mr. Shaw was included in our

investigation and there was no

connection found at all between Shaw

and the President's assassin.

JIM

If Mr. Shaw had no connection to the

assassination, why did the FBI

investigate him?  And why, if they

did, is his name not mentioned once

in the entire 26 volumes of the Warren

Report, even it if is to clear his

name?  I doubt this Attorney General

would qualify for my staff.

CHIEF JUSTICE

No, I don't think so.  Mr. Garrison

has presented absolutely nothing

publicly to contradict our findings.

As yet I have not heard one fact to

refute the Commission determination

that Lee Oswald was the lone killer.

JIM

I congratulate Mr. Shaw.  Most

witnesses have to wait for trial

before they're allowed to produce

sacred cows like the Chief Justice

of the land as a character witness,

who is of course not under oath and

free from the laws of perjury.

NEWSMAN 13

Mr. Garrison, if what you say is

even partly true in this case, you

realize you are damaging the

credibility of our government,

possibly destroying it?

JIM

Let me ask you... is a government

worth preserving when it lies to the

people?  It has become a dangerous

country, sir, when you can't trust

anyone anymore, when you can't tell

the truth.  I say let justice be

done, though the heavens fall.

JIM

In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer,

it says you were at Dealey Plaza two

hours before the assassination but

that...

MERCER

Yes, it was about 11 in the morning.

I was driving west on Elm Street

toward the Triple Underpass, in a

rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll

never forget that day.

MERCER

...there was quite a bit of traffic

and I was stopped alongside a green

pickup truck.  It was very noticeable

because it was blocking traffic and

it was parked with two wheels on the

curb.  When I saw the gun, I thought -

the Secret Service is not very secret.

MERCER

The next morning, Saturday, I went

to the FBI office and the agents

showed me photographs...

MERCER

I picked out three pictures that

looked generally like the driver of

the truck and then...

MERCER

That's the man.

FBI AGENT

(to Second Agent)

Jack Ruby.

SECOND AGENT

What about these others?  You said

they might be him.

MERCER

They look a little like him.  But

no,

(holding up the Ruby

photo)

I'm sure this is the man.

JIM

You mean you identified him on

Saturday, the day before Ruby shot

Oswald?

MERCER

That's right.  When I saw him on TV,

I was shocked.  I said to my family,

"that was the man I saw in the truck."

JIM

(skeptical)

But you didn't seem nearly so sure

in your statement to the Warren

Commission.

MERCER

That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison.

You see, they've been altered.  My

statements...

MERCER

This says "Mercer could not identify

any of the photographs as being

identical with the person she had

observed slouched over the wheel of

a green Ford pickup truck."  That's

not true.  I recognized him and I

told them so... They also said it

was a dark green air conditioning

truck, which it was not.  And here...

(she goes to another

report)

...on the Dallas Sheriff's report.

This is really strange.  See that

notarized signature on the bottom of

each page?  That's not my signature.

And there never was any notary present

during any of my questioning.

(she hands the papers

back to Jim)

I guess that's all...

JIM

Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man,

it's difficult to accept this.

MERCER

I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is

just not doing their job.

HUSBAND

I'm a Republican, Mr. Garrison, and

I don't go in for this kind of

government bashing, but I must tell

you something's not right when they

don't even bother to call Julia in

front of the Warren Commission.

JIM

They didn't call a lot of people,

Mr. Mercer.  I think it's safe to

say the Warren Report is a work of

fiction.

LOU

Beverly, tell Mr. Garrison about the

Carousel club.

BEVERLY (V.O.)

Oh yes, I used to go over there a

lot to see Jack and especially my

friend Jada who danced there.  It

was the real swinging spot in town.

Everybody came.  Businessmen,

politicians from Austin, Lyndon

Johnson's friends... Dallas was a

slow town back then.  You chewed

toothpicks, played dominos, spit and

dated policemen.  But Jack's was

exciting.  There were always cops

there.  Jack liked 'em around, but

he used to throw the drunks out

himself, 'cause he was kinda a violent-

tempered man... it seemed everybody

in those days knew Jack was with the

Mob.  The cops were "bad" back then -

they'd shake you down for the money

in your pocket.  They put a lotta

people in the cemetery, especially

colored people.

LOU

Beverly, what about Lee?

BEVERLY (V.O.)

Oh, yeah.  One time I came in, Jack

introduces me to these two guys.  He

said, "Beverly, this is my friend

Lee..." and I didn't catch the other

guy's name.  He was a weird-looking

guy with those funny little eyebrows.

The other guy, Lee, didn't make much

of an impression either.  He wasn't

good-looking or nuthin', he didn't

look like he had any money, and he

was in a bad mood, so I didn't pay

him much mind.  Well, I might not

remember a name, but I always remember

a face.  When I saw him tow weeks

later on the television, I screamed,

"Oh, my God - that's him!  That's

Jack's friend!"  I knew right then

it had something to do with the

Mafia... Well, about a week later,

after she told the newspapers she'd

met this guy Lee with Jack, Jada

disappears off the face of the

Earth...

BEVERLY (V.O.)

Never knew what happened to her till

Herman offered to sell me her

wardrobe.  I said, "but Jada's coming

back," and I remember the way he

smiled... and I knew she was never

coming back.

JIM

Will you testify,  Beverly?

BEVERLY

I don't think so, sir.

LOU

I thought when we came here, we had

an agreement.

BEVERLY

I just don't want to become another

statistic like her.  If they can

kill the President, do you think

they're gonna think twice about a

two-bit showgirl like me?

LOU

We could call you in, Beverly.

JIM

I know the pressure you're under,

Beverly.  Don't think I don't.

(as he exits)

I understand.

PRICE (V.O.)

...yes, sir, right here on this spot.

The shots came from near that wooden

fence over there, near the overpass.

PRICE

I saw a man run from this spot and

go behind the Book Depository - 30

minutes later I gave this information

to the Sheriff.

HOLLAND

I made it very clear to the Warren

people one of the shots came from

behind that picket fence.  I heard

the report and saw the smoke come

out about 6 or 8 feet above the

ground, right out from under those

trees.  There is no doubt whatsoever

in my mind...

DODD

(pointing)

...we, all four of us, all railroad

men, standing here, seen about the

same thing.  The smoke came from

behind the hedge - and a motorcycle

policeman dropped his cycle in the

street and run up the embankment...

HOLLAND

...we came around here to look for

tracks.  It rained that morning and

we found a bunch of cigarette butts.

Someone'd been standing about here...

LOU

This is a good spot, chief, for the

head shot.

JEAN HILL

I was standing here next to my friend

Mary Mooman, who took the photograph

when he was killed...

JEAN HILL

I jumped out in the street and yelled,

"Hey Mr. President, look over here,

we wanna take your picture."  He

looked up and then shots rang out.

Mary fell to the ground right away,

shouting, "Get down, they're shooting,

get down, they're shooting." I knew

it but I was moving to get closer to

him.  The driver had stopped - I

don't know what was wrong with that

driver.  And then, out of the corner

of my eye, I saw this flash of light,

in the bushes and that last shot...

just ripped his head off, I mean,

blood, brains, just blew everything...

JEAN HILL

I looked up and saw smoke from the

Knoll.  And everything was frozen -

seemed like people wasn't even

breathing, like you're looking at a

picture - except this one guy.  I

saw this one guy running from the

Book Depository towards the railroad

tracks.  And that was the same man I

saw on TV two days later shooting

Oswald.  That was Jack Ruby.  No

question about it.

JEAN HILL

It was him I was chasing up the Grassy

Knoll, thinking our guys had shot

back and maybe we got one of them.

I don't know what I would have done

if I had caught him, but I knew

something terrible had happened and

somebody had to do something.

*JEAN HILL

I never did catch him.  All I saw in

that parking area were railroad

workers and Dallas' finest.

FIRST AGENT

Secret Service, ma'am.  You're coming

with us.

JEAN HILL

Oh no, I'm not.  I don't know you.

We gotta catch this shooter - don't

you realize?

SECOND AGENT

(grabbing her other

shoulder)

I said you're coming with us.  I

want the pictures in your pocket.

JEAN HILL (V.O.)

...he put a hurt on me but good.

JEAN HILL

I don't have any pictures!  I have

to go back and find my friend Mary.

Lemme alone!

FIRST AGENT

Hush!  Just smile and keep walking.

JEAN HILL (V.O.)

These new people never identified

themselves.  They musta been watching

the whole thing 'cause they knew

everything Mary and me had been doing

that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard

to find - wearing that red raincoat.

MAN

How many shots you say you heard?

JEAN HILL

Four to six.

MAN

That's impossible.  You heard echoes

...echoes.  We have three bullets

and three shots which came from the

Book Depository and that's all we're

willing to say.

JEAN HILL (V.O.)

...which is strange 'cause this is

less than 20 minutes after the

assassination.

JEAN HILL

No, I saw a guy shooting from over

there.  He was behind that fence.

What are you going to do about it?

MAN

We have that taken care of.  You

only heard three shots and you are

not to talk to anyone about this.

No one, you hear?

JEAN HILL (V.O.)

I was scared.  It was all kinda queer,

but it sure felt like two and two

was coming up three... and then they

took Mary's five snapshots from me,

sent them to Washington, and when

they returned them weeks later, two

of them had the backgrounds

mutilated... The only one we saved

was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want

to go to Washington when the Warren

Commission subpoenaed me... so the

lawyer come down here and interviewed

me at Parkland Hospital.

JEAN HILL

He asked me why I thought I was in

danger and I said:

JEAN HILL

Well if they can kill the President,

they can certainly get me.

LAWYER

That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill.

We have the man that killed the

President.

JEAN HILL

No, you don't!

JEAN HILL

He kept trying to get me to change

my story about the shots.  He was

getting hot under the collar, and

telling the woman not to write when

he wanted.

JEAN HILL

Look, do you want the truth, or just

what you want me to say?

LAWYER

I want the truth.

JEAN HILL

The truth is that I heard between

four and six shots.  I'm not going

to lie for you.

LAWYER

...you heard echoes.

JEAN HILL

No.  I had guns all my life.  I used

to go turtle shooting.

LAWYER

I realize you're under a great deal

of stress .. it's clouded your

judgement.

JEAN HILL (V.O.)

So off the record, he starts talking

about my family, and even mentioned

my marriage was in trouble like I

didn't know it or something.  He got

angrier and angrier and then:

LAWYER

Look, we can put you in a mental

institution.  We can make you look

crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and

everybody knows how crazy she is.

JEAN HILL (V.O.)

I knew something was crooked as a

dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is

just taking a deposition gets that

involved and angry... sure enough,

when I finally read my testimony as

published by the Warren Commission,

it was a fabrication from start to

finish.

JIM

Are you willing to testify, Mrs.

Hill?

JEAN HILL

(without hesitation)

Damned right I would.  Somebody's

got to tell the truth around here

'cause the Government sure ain't

doing it.

LOU

The Zapruder film establishes 3 shots

in 5.6 seconds.  Here.  I'm Oswald.

Time me.

JIM

Go!

LOU

Time?

JIM

Between six and seven seconds.

LOU

The key is the second and third shots

came right on top of each other, and

it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to

recycle this thing.

(he recycles the bolt

for firing)

The other problem is there was a

tree right there...

(he points)

Blocking the first two shots at the

time they occur in the Zapruder film.

JIM

Didn't Hoover say something about

that?  The leaves had fallen off in

November?

LOU

It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.

(he shakes his head)

It sheds it's leaves the first week

of March.  You try to hit a moving

target at 88 yards through heavy

foliage with this cheap 13-dollar

sucker, the world's worst shoulder

weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two

sets of tests and not one of their

sharpshooters could match Oswald's

performance.  Not one.  And Oswald

was at best a medium shot.  The scope

was defective on it, too.  I mean

this is the whole essence of the

case to me.  The guy couldn't do the

shooting.  Nobody could.  And they

sold this lemon to the American

public.

JIM

The Zapruder film is the proof they

didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get

our hands on it.

LOU

That means we gotta subpoena Time-

Life on it.

JIM

(looks out the window)

Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up

Houston?  There's plenty of time -

he's out in the open - a frontal

shot?

LOU

I asked myself the same thing.  Common

sense.  Even if you miss the first

shot, if he accelerates you still

got him for a second shot.  No...

the only reason for waiting to get

him on Elm is you got him in a

triangulated crossfire.  You got him

on a flat low trajectory from the

front at the fence there.

LOU

...you put a third team there - in

that building, on a low floor.

LOU

When Kennedy gets to the kill zone,

it's a turkey shoot.

JIM

(aiming)

How many men?

LOU

One shooter.  One spotter on a radio.

Maybe three teams.  I'd say these

were professional riflemen, chief,

serious people.  Hunters...  patient.

It takes skill to kill with a rifle,

that's why there's been no execution

of an executive with one in 200

years... "3-2-1...  green!"

(he taps Jim on the

shoulder)

Or else "Abort!  Abort!"

LOU

Main Street's over there - the

original parade route on the way to

the Trade Mart.  Too far right?

Impossible shot.

LOU

So they changed the route to bring

it this way.

JIM

Who do you think changed the parade

route?

LOU

Beats me.  City officials.  Secret

Service.  Dallas police.  They did a

dry run with Chief Curry a few days

before.  But they didn't bother

running through Dealey.  They stopped

right there, said something like,

"and afterwards there's only the

freeway," and went home.

JIM

You know who the mayor was?

LOU

No.

JIM

Earle Cabell.  And guess who his

brother is?

LOU

Who?

JIM

General Charles Cabell.  Deputy

Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy

in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs

fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon,

called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he

came to New Orleans to address the

Foreign Policy Association, you know

who introduced him?  Our friend Clay

Shaw.

LOU

The Warren Commission call him?

JIM

(shaking his head)

His boss was the one on the Warren

Commission who handled all the leads

to the intelligence community.

LOU

Allen Dulles?

JIM

(he nods)

Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy

fired them both.  Cabell was his

deputy for nine years.

(sickened)

Talk about the fox investigating the

chicken coop.  Now we'll have to

subpoena them, Lou.

LOU

They're gonna love you, chief.

JIM

Maybe we should just call it a day,

Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a

little behind.  We got two people

killed, maybe more we never thought

about.

LOU

You never got anyone killed, boss.

Their actions killed them years

before.  If we stopped now, it'd be

even more wrong.

JIM

(in present)

Subpoena them, Lou - Dulles, the

Cabells, Time-Life... the whole damned

lot of 'em!

AL

The U.S. Attorney in Washington

"declines" to serve our subpoena on

Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA

Director Richard Helms, or any FBI

agent we named.

JIM

Well, what do you expect from a pig

but a grunt.

AL

Without them, it's going to be near

impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's

connection to the CIA.  We got the

same problem with the governors.

All of them.  Reagan in California

won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses

Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha,

and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.

BILL

What the hell is going on?  Never

before has an extradition request

from this office been refused.

AL

We haven't tried to get Julia Anne

Mercer in?

JIM

No, she could get hurt.  If you

believe what's happening to these

other people.

NUMA

She's the best damn witness we have!

JIM

I just don't want to do it.  What

else?

NUMA

Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The

bad news is the IRS has just requested

an audit on your income from this

office.

JIM

(he snorts)

I expected that two months ago, and

they're wasting their time... The

bad news is the National Guard has

just asked me to resign after 18

years.

(we see his hurt)

Well, maybe that's good news - it

was never as good as combat, but

this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald

and Shaw?

BILL

Yeah.  They were seen together in

Clinton in early September.  The

Civil Rights Movement was running a

voter registration drive.

BILL

...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was

working on some arms deal to discredit

the civil rights movement.  No one

really knows what they were doing

there, but everyone sure saw 'em.

They stood out like cottonballs.  I

got whites and blacks saw 'em, but

last time I checked there was nothing

illegal with registering to vote.

We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon

Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall

near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's

tough, boss - no one wants to talk

about Shaw.  He's...

LOU

(back to present)

You know you keep saying that.

BILL

Keep saying what?

LOU

You're not digging.

JIM

I think Clinton is a breakthrough.

Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald.

Is that right?  It proves he's a

liar.  Keep on it, Bill.

(a look from Lou)

SUSIE

This is interesting - are you ready

for this?  Oswald went to see the

FBI two weeks before the

assassination.  It seems Special

Agent Hosty made three routine visits

to his house, supposedly to keep an

eye on Marina Oswald.

OSWALD

I want to see Special Agent Hosty.

RECEPTIONIST

I'm sorry, he's not in.  Can someone

else help you?

OSWALD

Can I use a pen?

SUSIE (V.O.)

He left a note.  Hosty told a Dallas

newspaperman it was a warning to him

to stop questioning Marina at their

home when Oswald was not present.

She was not a citizen, so possibly

he was threatening to deport her

back to Russia.

SUSIE

But what the note really said no one

knows because his boss Shanklin told

Hosty...

SHANKLIN

(reading the note)

Oswald's dead now.  There's no trial.

Get rid of it.  I don't even want

this in the office.  Get rid of it,

Hosty.

(he gives it back to

Hosty)

SUSIE (V.O.)

Hosty tore it up and flushed it down

the toilet.  Waggoner Carr, the

Attorney  General of Texas, says he

had evidence from the Dallas Sheriff's

office that Oswald had been employed

as an undercover informant for the

FBI at a salary of $200 a month,

beginning more than a year before

the murder.

JIM

(in present)

This is just speculation, people,

but what if the note was describing

the assassination attempt on J.F.K.?

(the staff seem

surprised by the

thought)

Come on guys, think - that's the

only reason to destroy it, because

if it was any kind of threat, like

Hosty said, they would've kept it

'cause it makes their case against

the "angry lone nut" stronger!

Remember the New Orleans meeting

with Agent Quigley the day he got

busted?

JIM

...there again Quigley destroyed the

notes of the meeting.  I think we

can raise the possibility that Oswald

not only was an informant but that

he may well have been the original

source for the telex we have dated

November 17 warning of the Kennedy

assassination in Dallas on November

22.

JIM

William Walter, the night clerk on

duty here in the FBI office, gave me

a copy of this.  It went all over

the country.  Nothing was done, and

the motorcade went ahead on schedule -

and this wasn't even mentioned in

the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.

AL (V.O.)

"Threat to assassinate President

Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November

22-23.  Information received by the

Bureau has determined that a militant

revolutionary group may attempt to

assassinate President Kennedy on his

proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc,

etc..."

JIM (V.O.)

...shortly after the assassination,

Walter says, the telex was removed

from all the files in all cities, as

an obvious embarrassment to the

Bureau.  I believe Oswald was sending

information through Hosty...

JIM

I have a hunch that from the get go,

Oswald had infiltrated this group,

probably Cubans or right-wing

extremists.  He was at the Book

Depository that day, told to be there

by their handlers, either to prevent

the assassination or to take part in

it.  They coulda told him anything,

either 1) they were going to close

down the plotters that day, or 2)

they were going to fake an attack on

Kennedy to whip up public opinion

against Russia or Cuba and reverse

his policies - it doesn't really

matter what they told him, 'cause he

was under orders, he was a foot

soldier.

OSWALD

(to the two young

Cubans)

I can get you in and up there.  This

is a shot out the southeast window

of the sixth floor.  That floor will

be unoccupied between noon and one.

BULL

What about the elevator?

OSWALD

I can close it off.  The only access

is a stairwell.

BULL

We get them in as an air-conditioning

unit.

RUBY

No.  A floor refurbishing group.

Got the van, the uniforms...

OSWALD

(his back to the screen)

...if we can get the motorcade to

turn from Main onto Houston, that'll

do the trick, 'cause it'll slow down

to make the turn here.  You can't

miss.

(to the two young

Cubans)

He's a dead duck.

BILL

I don't buy it, chief - why would

the FBI cover it up?  You're talking

the whole FBI here.  A telex that

disappears from every single FBI

office in the country?

JIM

There's a word - orders.

SUSIE

Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't

you have enough proof of the FBI's

complicity now?

BILL

(to Susie)

Maybe I have a little more respect

for this country's institutions than

you do, Susie.  You tell me how the

hell you can keep a conspiracy going

between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and

Army Intelligence and who knows what

else, when you know you can't even

keep a secret in this room between

12 people!  We got leaks everywhere!

We're going to trial here!  What the

hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby,

Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw -

maybe he's an agent, I don't know,

but as a covert operator in my book

he's wide open for blackmail 'cause

of his homosexuality.

JIM

Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't

know exactly what he is, where he

fits, and I don't care.  I do know

he's lying through his teeth and I'm

not gonna let go of him!

BILL

So for those reasons, you're going

to trial against Clay Shaw, chief?

Well, you're gonna lose!  We should

be investigating all our Mafia leads

here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello,

Santos Trafficante - I can buy that

a hell of a lot easier than the

Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows

Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa -

Trafficante - Marcello, they hire

some guns and they do Kennedy and

maybe the Government doesn't want to

open up a whole can o'worms there

because it used the Mob to get to

Castro.  Y'know, Castro being

assassinated sounds pretty wild to

John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the

book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to

me.

JIM

I don't doubt their involvement,

Bill, but at a low level.  Could the

Mob change the parade route, Bill,

or eliminate the protection for the

President?  Could the Mob send Oswald

to Russia and get him back?  Could

the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and

the Dallas Police to make a mess of

the investigation?  Could the Mob

appoint the Warren Commission to

cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck

the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence

the national media to go to sleep?

And since when has the Mob used

anything but .38's for hits, up close?

The Mob wouldn't have the guts or

the power for something of this

magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls,

orders, times, schedules.  This was

a military-style ambush from start

to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon

Johnson waiting in the wings.

BILL

Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson

was involved?  The President of the

United States?

JIM

I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson

got $1 billion for his Texas friends,

Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh

Bay for the military in Vietnam.

That's just for openers.

BILL

Boss, are you calling the President

a murderer?

JIM

If I'm so far from the truth, why is

the FBI bugging our offices?  Why

are our witnesses being bought off

and murdered?  Why are Federal

agencies blocking our extraditions

and subpoenas when we were never

blocked before?

BILL

Maybe 'cause there's some rogue

element in the Government!

JIM

With a full-blown conspiracy to cover

it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare,

Bill?

BILL

Yeah.

JIM

Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius,

they too are honorable men."  Who

killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five

Senators.  All it takes is one Judas,

Bill - a few people, on the inside,

Pentagon, CIA...

BILL

(he gets up)

This is Louisiana, chief.  How the

hell do you know who your daddy is?

'Cause your momma told you so...

You're way out there taking a crap

in the wind, boss, and I for one

ain't going along on this one.

(he exits)

Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one

of his best men.

LOU

Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill

for a long time.  He's fighting

everything.

JIM

We need him back.

AL

Bill wasted a goddamn month trying

to prove that mob boys like Barding

and Jack Ruby played ball in right

field with Hunt Oil.

LOU

I don't trust the guy.

JIM

(standing)

Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I

value Bill as much as anyone here.

(Lou reacts angrily)

We all need to make room for someone

else's ideas, Lou, especially me.

Maybe Oswald is what everyone says

he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.

AL

I've seen him copying files, leaving

here late at night.

LOU

I just plain don't trust him anymore.

JIM

(angry)

Maybe you didn't hear what I said.

I will not tolerate this infighting

among the staff, I warn you that...

LOU

(suddenly)

Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue

working with Bill.

JIM

(pause, then quietly)

Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?

LOU

Well, if that's what you want to

call it.  I didn't ever think it

would come to this.  I guess I am,

boss.

JIM

I will not have any damned ultimatums

put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your

resignation.

LOU

You sure got it.  You're one stubborn

and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're

making one hell of a mistake!

SUSIE

Aren't you being a little hard?

JIM

No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone

else?

MATTIE

My God!  My God!  What have they

done!

(angrily)

It's lynchin' time!

VIRGINIA

I'll get it.

(into phone)

Hello.

MALE VOICE

Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's

daughter?

VIRGINIA

Yes?

MALE VOICE

Virginia or Elizabeth?

VIRGINIA

Virginia.

MALE VOICE

Virginia, you're a lucky little girl.

Your daddy has entered you in a beauty

contest.  Would you like to be in a

beauty contest?

VIRGINIA

That sounds fun.

MALE VOICE

I need some information from you

then.  How old are you?

VIRGINIA

Six.

MALE VOICE

And how tall are you?

NEWSMAN 9

To repeat - 39-year-old Martin Luther

King, who preached non-violence and

won the Nobel Peace Prize, was cut

down earlier today by a sniper's

bullets while standing on the porch

of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis,

Tennessee.  He was surrounded by his

closest aides.  The police say they

have no suspects at this time.  Mr.

King...

MALE VOICE

And you get of from school at 3 every

day?

VIRGINIA

Yes.

MALE VOICE

Do you walk home?

VIRGINIA

Uh huh.

LIZ

(taking the phone)

Who are you talking to?

MALE VOICE

Okay, Virginia, that's all I need to

know.  I'll call you again when it's

time for the beauty contest.

LIZ

Who's this?... Hello?... Hello?

VIRGINIA

(excited)

Mama, I'm going to be in a beauty

contest!

LIZ

What did he ask you?

VIRGINIA

Well, he asked me everything.  He

asked me...

LIZ

Did you enter Virginia into a beauty

contest?

JIM

(absorbed in the TV)

What?

LIZ

(hysterical)

A man just called.  He asked her

everything!

JIM

(distracted)

Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther

King was killed in Memphis today!

LIZ

(screaming)

Your daughter's life was just

threatened!

JIM

Just a crank making phone calls.

Happens a dozen times a day at the

office.

LIZ

Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a

murderer, who knows!

JIM

Only cowards make crank calls,

sweetheart, nothing is going to

happen.

LIZ

How do you know?  How do you even

know what goes on in this house

anymore!  You're too busy making

speeches, stirring up every crazed

Klansman in Louisiana after us!

JIM

Get a hold of yourself.

LIZ

I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids

and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it

anymore.

JIM

Honey, come on.  The government wants

you to be scared.  They want everybody

to be scared to speak out.  They

count on it.  But there's nothing to

be scared of.

LIZ

You and your government!  What's the

matter with you?  Don't you have any

feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind

of man are you?

JIM

I'll take them up to my mother's if

it'll make you feel better.  Spend a

week.  I'll change the locks, the

phone lines, I'll even get a

bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth,

get a hold of yourself.

LIZ

Jim, before this Kennedy thing,

nothing mattered to you in this life

more than your children.  The other

night Jasper tried to show you a

drawing.  You didn't even notice he

was there.  He came to me bawling

his little eyes out.  Jim, he's

sensitive - he needs more from you.

JIM

I promise I'll make more time for

Jasper.

LIZ

Is it such a chore?  I don't

understand you.

JIM

Damn it, if I say I'll spend more

time with him, I'll spend more time

with him.  I can't fight you and the

world too, Liz.

LIZ

I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just

trying to reach you.  You've changed.

JIM

Of course, I've changed!  My eyes

have opened, and once they're open,

believe me, what used to look normal

seems insane!  And now King.  Don't

you think this has something to do

with that?  Can't you see?

LIZ

(she explodes)

I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm

tired.  I've had enough!  They say

you don't have anything anyway!

Everybody in town's talking.  You're

ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're

attacking him because he's homosexual!

Going ahead with this stupid "trial"!

Did you ever once stop and consider

what he's going through?

JIM

(astounded)

That's not why I'm attacking him!

You don't believe me - all this time

you never believed me.

LIZ

Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe

there was a conspiracy, but not the

government.  I just want to raise

our children and live a normal life!

I want my life back!

JIM

Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I!

I had a life too, y'know - I had a

life, too.  But you just can't bury

your head in the sand like some

ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's

not just about you - and your well-

being and your two cars and your

kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes

fine honey."  While our kids grow up

into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm

not "fine" about that, I'm angry.

My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours

is, too!  And if you don't want to

support me I can understand that but

don't you go start making threats of

taking the children away.

LIZ

You never talked to me this way

before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making

any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm

taking the kids to my mother's.  I

am - I am.

JIM

Go on then, get out!  Go hide

someplace.  Join the rest of them!

They'll tell you I'm crazy.  You got

plenty of people'll tell you Jim

Garrison's crazy.  You won't have a

problem filing your divorce papers

on me ...somebody's got to try,

goddammit, somebody!

JASPER

Are we going away, Daddy?

JIM

Well, it looks like it, Jasper.

JASPER

Because of Kennedy?

(a beat.  Jim doesn't

answer)

Are the same people gonna kill us,

Daddy?

JIM

No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.

VIRGINIA

Do you love us?

JIM

Yes, of course I do, honey.

VIRGINIA

No.  I mean like mommy loves us.

She really loves us.

JASPER

I'm scared.

JIM

(bending down)

There's nothing wrong with feeling a

little scared, Jasper, Virginia.

Telling the truth can be a scary

thing.  It scared President Kennedy,

but he was a brave man.  If you let

yourself be too scared, then you let

the bad guys take over the country,

don't you - and then everybody gets

scared.

JASPER/VIRGINIA

Stay with Mom, Daddy... please.

SIDEKICK

And now, Jerry, here's Big Jim

Garrison, District Attorney of New

Orleans, Louisiana.

JOHNSON

Welcome, District Attorney Garrison.

May I call you Jim?

JIM

I've been called everything under

the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever

you like.

JOHNSON

First we had your charge that the

Cuban exiles killed the President,

then the Mob, then you said the oil

billionaires did it, then you said

the Minutemen and the Ku Klux Klan

collaborated to do it, now your latest

theory seems to be that the CIA and

the FBI and the Pentagon and the

White House all combined in some

elaborate conspiracy to kill John

Kennedy.  Let me ask you, is there

anyone besides Lee Harvey Oswald who

you think did not conspire to kill

the President?

JIM

How many hours do I have to answer

that one?  Well let's just say this,

Jerry - I've stopped beating my wife.

(the audience laughs)

Or maybe you should ask Lyndon

Johnson.  We know he has some answers.

JOHNSON

There have been a number of reports

in reputable news media - Time,

Newsweek, our own NBC - that you

have gone way beyond the legal means

available to a prosecutor, that you've

intimidated and drugged witnesses,

bribed them, urged them to commit

perjury.  What is your response?

JIM

Your faith in the veracity of the

major media is touching, Jerry.  It

indicates that the Age of Innocence

is not yet over.  But seriously,

Jerry, people aren't interested in

Jim Garrison - they want the hard

evidence!  They want to know why he

was killed and what forces were

opposed to...

JOHNSON

(interrupting)

Some people would say you're paranoid.

JIM

Well, if I am, why is the Government

concealing evidence?

JOHNSON

Are they?  Why would they?

JIM

(pulling out his

briefcase)

That's exactly my question, Jerry.

Maybe I'd better show you some

pictures so you can begin to

understand what I am talking about.

JIM

These arrests were photographed

minutes after the assassination, and

were never shown to the American

public.  They show...

JOHNSON

(sharply)

Pictures like this don't show up on

television!

JIM

(holding the picture

up again)

Sure they do.  The camera can pick

this up.

JOHNSON

(yanking his arm down)

No, it can't!

JIM

(quickly realizes

he's about to be cut

off)

Those men you just saw were arrested

in Dallas minutes after the

assassination.  They were never seen

again.  No record of arrest, no

fingerprint, no mugshot, nothing.

They all got away.

JOHNSON

We'll be back after these messages.

AL

Jim, bad news.  Bill's turned, boss.

I think he's given everything we've

got to the Feds.

NUMA

We studied the memos - there was

nothing there, chief, nothing!  When

we went to confront him, the landlady

said that sonofabitch just took off,

left everything.

SUSIE

I'm sorry.

JIM

I know.

LIZ

(to Jim)

I'm sorry.

NUMA

Something sure scared him.

JIM

Bill doesn't scare that easy.

Somebody got to his thinking.  He

was never that good a thinker.

NEWSMAN 9

Much is at stake tonight in

California.  Public opinion polls

show Senator Robert Kennedy of New

York leading Senator Eugene McCarthy

of Minnesota.  Their anti-Vietnam

War message is obviously striking a

chord with the voters, and whoever

wins tonight will certainly emerge

as the favorite over Vice-President

Humphrey to win the nomination in

Chicago in August.  That man now

seems to be Senator Kennedy.

NUMA

Sure sounds like he's winning.

JIM

He'll never make it.  If he wins,

they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge

his brother.  He'll stop that war.

No, they'll kill him before they let

him become President.

AL

Boss, with Broussard they have

everything.  All our witnesses, our

strategy for the trial.  We'd have

to doublecheck all his work, there

could be false leads... we gotta

rethink this trial.

JIM

I don't think so, Al.  You remember

the Hemingway story, "The Old Man

and the Sea"?

(Al nods)

The old fisherman manages to catch

this great fish - a fish so huge he

has to tie it to the side of the

boat to get it back in.  But by the

time he reached shore, the fish had

long since been picked apart by sharks

and nothing was left but the skeleton.

NUMA

Then what are we going through all

this trouble for?

JIM

It's a means to an end.  This war

has two fronts - in the court of

law, we hope, against the odds, to

nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge.

In the court of public opinion, it

could take another 25 or 30 years

for the truth to come out, but at

least we're going to strike the first

blow.

LIZ

And if you're wrong?

JIM

(rising)

I never doubted for a second that I

was.

(softly)

Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?

LIZ

I don't think so, Jim...

NEWSMAN 1

With 53% of the precincts reporting,

Senator Kennedy continues to hold a

lead of 48% to 41% over Senator

McCarthy.  CBS News has projected

Senator Robert Kennedy the winner of

the crucial California primary.

ROBERT KENNEDY

(voice over on TV)

...and that is what has been going

on within the United States over the

last three years - the division, the

violence, the disenchantment, whether

it's between blacks and whites,

between poor and the more affluent,

or between age groups or the war in

Vietnam - we can start to work

together.  We are a great country,

an unselfish country and a

compassionate country.  I intend to

make that my basis for running.

NEWSMAN 1

(shaken)

SENATOR KENNEDY HAS BEEN SHOT!  WE

DO NOT KNOW HOW SERIOUS IT IS YET.

SENATOR KENNEDY HAS BEEN SHOT.

JIM

They killed him, honey.

LIZ

(groggily)

Huh?

JIM

(strangled)

He won... and they killed Robert

Kennedy.  They shot him down.

LIZ

(realizing, with terror)

Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I

can't believe it.  Both of them,

both brothers, oh my God!

LIZ

You're right, it hasn't ended, has

it?

JIM

(awkward)

I wish I could've loved you more...

I feel sometimes like I didn't ever..

love you or the children enough...

I'm sorry.

O'KEEFE

That's Clay Bertrand.  That's the

man I saw at David Ferrie's.

DYMOND

(words wafting)

That's who you say you saw... a

confessed homosexual, convicted of

solicitation, pandering... a man who

has lied about most everything, who...

BUNDY

It was that man there, yessir.  He

was at the Pontchartrain wall with

the man who shot the President.  I

remember him cause o' his limp there.

DYMOND

A heroin addict, injecting himself

at the wall, barely conscious...

COLLINS

(pointing at Shaw)

...that was the man there.  He dropped

Oswald off on the voter line.  I

remember 'cause they were the only

white strangers around that morning.

That big, black Cadillac of his made

me think they might be FBI.

TOWN MARSHALL

(looking at Shaw)

...said he was a representative of

one International Trade Mart in New

Orleans.

DYMOND

...more than five years ago, for two

minutes.  It's fair to say you could

be mistaken, isn't it?

ANDREWS

...figment of my imagination... The

cat's stewing me, the oyster's

shucking me I told him, you got the

right at-at but the wrong oh-oh...

Bertrand is not Shaw, scout's honor

and you can tell him I said so...

SUSIE

(counter-arguing)

Objection, your Honor.  This office

has won a conviction of perjury

against Dean Andrews on this matter.

DYMOND

Exception taken.  That case is on

appeal!

DYMOND

(relishing this)

Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David

Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a

vacation here from your accounting

business in New York, you had drinks

and, under the influence discussed

killing Kennedy, is that not so?

GOLDBERG

I did.

DYMOND

Why?

GOLDBERG

Well, I wanted to make sure she's

the same girl I sent.

DYMOND

I see... and why are you experiencing

this paranoia?

GOLDBERG

(launching into his

explanation)

Well, you see, I've been subject to

hypnosis and psychological warfare

ever since 1948, when I was in

Korea...

AL

He was one of Broussard's witnesses,

chief.  I'm sorry.  He was totally

sane when we took his affidavit.

SUSIE

But how does Dymond know what to

ask?  FUCK!  We're dead.

GOLDBERG

When someone tries to get your

attention - catch your eye - that's

a clue right off.

GARRISON

Your Honor, I call police officer

Aloysisus Habighorst to the stand.

JUDGE HAGGERTY

I'm going to have to ask the jury to

leave the courtroom.

GARRISON

What?

JUDGE HAGGERTY

I'm sorry, Jim, but the defendant

did not have his lawyer present when

asked.

HABIGHORST

Any alias?

SHAW

Clay Bertrand.

GARRISON (V.O.)

Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's

been standard booking procedure to

ask an alias.  You know that.  There's

no constitutional requirement that

says a lawyer has to be present for

routine questions.

JUDGE HAGGERTY

I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm

ruling it inadmissible.

GARRISON

That's our case!

JUDGE HAGGERTY

If that's your case, you didn't have

a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever

Habighorst said, anyway.

GARRISON

I can't believe you're saying this

in the courtroom.

JUDGE HAGGERTY

(feistier)

Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the

jury.

AL

We're filing for a writ to the

appellate court.

JUDGE HAGGERTY

You do that.

DYMOND

...Oswald?

SHAW

No, I did not.

DYMOND

...ever called Dean Andrews?

SHAW

No, I did not.

DYMOND

...and have you ever met David Ferrie?

SHAW

(with a smirk of

amusement)

No, I would not even know what he

looked like except for the pictures

I've been shown.

DYMOND

...did you ever use the alias Clay

Bertrand?

SHAW

No, I did not.

DYMOND

Thank you... Mr. Shaw.

JIM

Well, a very great actor has just

given us a great performance, Your

Honor, but we are nowhere closer to

the truth.  Let it be noted, my office

is charging Clay Shaw with outright

perjury on the fifteen answers he

has given, not one word of this...

JUDGE HAGGERTY

You're out of order, Jim Boy, now

sit down.  Strike those remarks!!

JIM

To prove their was a conspiracy

involving Clay Shaw we must prove

there was more than one man involved

in the assassination.  To do that,

we must look at the Zapruder film,

which my office has subpoenaed.  The

American public has not seen that

film because it has been kept locked

in a vault in the Time-Life Building

in New York City for the last five

years.  There is a reason for that.

Watch.

JIM

A picture speaks a thousand words.

Yet sometimes the truth is too simple

for some...  The Warren Commission

thought they had an open and shut

case: three bullets, one assassin -

but two things happened that made it

virtually impossible: 1)the Zapruder

film which you just saw, and 2)the

third wounded man, Jim Tague, who

was nicked by a fragment down by the

Triple Underpass.  The time frame of

5.6 seconds established by the

Zapruder film left no possibility of

a fourth shot from Oswald's rifle,

but the shot or fragment that left a

superficial wound on Tague's cheek

had to come from a bullet that missed

the car entirely.  Now they had two

bullets that hit, and we know one of

them was the fatal head shot.  So a

single bullet remained to account

for all seven wounds in Kennedy and

Connally.  But rather than admit to

a conspiracy or investigate further,

the Commission chose to endorse the

theory put forth by an ambitious

junior counsellor, Arlen Specter.

One of the grossest lies ever forced

on the American people, we've come

to know it as the "magic bullet"

theory.

JIM

The magic bullet enters the

President's back, headed downward at

an angle of 17 degrees.  It then

moves upward in order to leave

Kennedy's body from the front of his

neck - his neck wound number two -

where it waits 1.6 seconds, turns

right and continues into Connally's

body at the rear of his right armpit -

wound number three.  Then, the bullet

heads downward at an angle of 27

degrees, shattering Connally's fifth

rib and leaving from the right side

of his chest - wounds four and five.

The bullet continues downward and

then enters Connally's right wrist -

wound number six - shattering the

radius bone.  It then enters his

left thigh - wound number seven -

from which it later falls out and is

found in almost "pristine" condition

on a stretcher in a corridor of

Parkland Hospital.

(he shows a mock-up

of the "pristine"

bullet)

That's some bullet.  Anyone who's

been in combat can tell you never in

the history of gunfire has there

been a bullet like this.

(the court laughs)

The Army Wound Ballistics experts at

Edgewood Arsenal fired some comparison

bullets and not one of them looked

anything like this one.

(he shows mock-ups of

comparison bullets)

Take a look at CE 856, an identical

bullet fired through the wrist of a

human cadaver - just one of the bones

smashed by the magic bullet.  Yet

the government says it can prove

this with some fancy physics in a

nuclear laboratory.  Of course they

can.  Theoretical physics can prove

an elephant can hang from a cliff

with it's tail tied to a daisy, but

use your eyes - your common sense -

(he holds the bullet)

Seven wounds, skin, bone.  This single

bullet explanation is the foundation

of the Warren Commission's claim of

a lone assassin.  And once you

conclude the magic bullet could not

create all seven of those wounds,

you have to conclude there was a

fourth shot and a second rifleman.

And if there was a second rifleman,

there had to be a conspiracy, which

we believe involved the accused Clay

Shaw.  Fifty-one witnesses, gentlemen

of the jury, thought they heard shots

coming from the Grassy Knoll, which

is to the right and front of the

President.

JIM

Key witnesses that day - Charles

Brehm, a combat vet, right behind

Jean Hill and Mary Moorman, S.M.

Holland and Richard Dodd on the

overpass, J.C. Price overlooking the

whole Plaza, Randolph Carr, a

steelworker, who served in the Rangers

in North Africa, William Newman,

father of two children who hit the

deck on the north side of Elm, Abraham

Zapruder, James Simmons - each of

these witnesses has no doubt

whatsoever one or more shots came

from behind the picket fence!  Twenty

six trained medical personnel at

Parkland Hospital saw with their own

eyes the back of the President's

head blasted out.

PETERS

(describing the wound)

...a large 7 cm opening in the right

occipitoparietal area, a considerable

portion of the brain was missing

there.

(he gestures to his

head)

MCCLELLAND

...almost a fifth or perhaps a quarter

of the back of the head - this area

here...

(he indicates his

head)

...had been blasted out along with

the brain tissue there.  The exit

hole in the rear of his head was

about 120 mm. across.  There was

also a large piece of skull attached

to a flap of skin in the right

temporal area.

JIM (V.O.)

Not one of the civilian doctors who

examined the President at Parkland

Hospital regarded his throat wound

as anything but a wound of entry.

The doctors found no wounds of entry

in the back of the head.  But the

body was then illegally moved to

Washington for the autopsy.

MEDICAL EXAMINER

Texas Law, sir, requires the autopsy

be done here.  You're not taking him

with you!

KENNY O'DONNELL

Sonofabitch, you're not telling me

what to do!  Get the hell outta the

way!

JIM (V.O.)

Because when a coup d'etat has

occurred there's a big difference

between an autopsy performed by

civilian doctors and one by military

doctors working for the government.

JIM (V.O.)

The departure of Air Force One from

Love Field that Friday afternoon was

not so much a takeoff as it was a

getaway with the newly sworn in

President.

DYMOND (V.O.)

Objection, your honor.

JUDGE

Sustained.

JIM (V.O.)

On the plane, of course, Lee Harvey

Oswald's guilt was announced by the

White House Situation Room to the

passengers before any kind of

investigation had started.  The "lone

nut" solution is in place.

DYMOND (V.O.)

Objection!  Your Honor!

JUDGE

Sustained.  Mr. Garrison, would you

please bottle the acid.

JIM

The three Bethesda Naval Hospital

doctors picked by the Military left

something to be desired inasmuch as

none of them had experience with

combat gunfire wounds.  Through their

autopsy we have been able to justify

eight wounds - three to Kennedy,

five to Connally - from just two

bullets, one of these bullets the

"magic bullet".

JIM

Colonel Finck, are you saying someone

told you not to dissect the neck?

FINCK

I was told that the family wanted

examination of the head.

JIM

As a pathologist it was your

obligation to explore all possible

causes of death, was it not?

FINCK

I had the cause of death.

JIM

Your Honor, I would ask you to direct

the witness to answer my question.

Why did Colonel Finck not dissect

the track of the bullet wound in the

neck?

FINCK

Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that -

he said...

HUMES

Who's in charge here?

ARMY GENERAL

I am.

FINCK (V.O.)

I don't remember his name.  You must

understand it was quite crowded, and

when you are called in circumstances

like that to look at the wound of

the President who is dead, you don't

look around too much to ask people

for their names and who they are.

JIM (V.O.)

But you were a qualified pathologist.

Was this Army general a qualified

pathologist?

FINCK (V.O.)

No.

JIM (V.O.)

But you took his orders.  He was

directing the autopsy.

FINCK (V.O.)

No, because there were others.  There

were admirals.

JIM (V.O.)

There were admirals.

FINCK (V.O.)

Oh yes, there were admirals - and

when you are a lieutenant colonel in

the Army you just follow orders, and

at the end of the autopsy we were

specifically told - as I recall it

was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon

General of the Navy - we were

specifically told not to discuss the

case.

KENNEY

(in Bethesda scene)

Gentlemen, what you've seen in this

room is intensely private to the

Kennedy family and it is not our

business to...

JIM

In addition to which, 1) the chief

pathologist, Commander Humes, by his

own admission voluntarily burned his

autopsy notes, 2)never released the

autopsy photos to the public, 3)

President Johnson ordered the blood

soaked limousine filled with bullet

holes and clues to be immediately

washed and rebuilt, 4) sent John

Connally's bloody suit right to the

cleaners, and 5) when my office

finally got a court order to examine

President Kennedy's brain in the

National Archives in the hopes of

finding from what direction the

bullets came, we were told by the

government the President's brain had

disappeared!

JIM

So what really happened that day?

Let's just for a moment speculate,

shall we?  We have the epileptic

seizure around 12:15 P.M....

distracting the police, making it

easier for the shooters to move into

their places.  The epileptic later

vanished, never checking into the

hospital.  The A Team gets on the

6th floor of the Book Depository...

JIM (V.O.)

They were refurbishing the floors in

the Depository that week, which

allowed unknown workmen in and out

of the building.  The men move quickly

into position just minutes before

the shooting.

JIM (V.O.)

The second spotter is probably calling

all the shots on a radio to the two

other teams.  He as the best overall

view - "the God spot".

JIM (V.O.)

B Team - one rifleman and one spotter

with a headset, with access to the

building - moves into a low floor of

the Dal-Tex Building.

JIM (V.O.)

The third team, the C Team, moves in

behind the picket fence above the

Grassy Knoll, where the shooter and

the spotter are first seen by the

late Lee Bowers in the watchtower of

the railyard.  They have the best

position of all.  Kennedy is close

and on a flat low trajectory.

JIM (V.O.)

Probably two to three more men are

down in the crowd on Elm... ten to

twelve men... three teams, three

shooters.  The triangulation of fire

Clay Shaw and David Ferrie discussed

two months before.  They've walked

the Plaza, they know every inch.

They've calibrated their sights,

practiced on moving targets.  They're

ready.  It's going to be a turkey

shoot.  Kennedy's motorcade makes

the turn from Main onto Houston.

JIM (V.O.)

Six witnesses see two gunmen on the

sixth floor of the Depository moving

around.  Some of them think they're

policemen with rifles.

ARNOLD

(under)

...probably a security agent.

JIM (V.O.)

John Powell, a prisoner on the sixth

floor of the Dallas County Jail,

sees them.

POWELL

(under)

...quite a few of us saw them.

Everybody was hollering and yelling

and that.  We thought is was security

guys...

JIM (V.O.)

...they don't shoot him coming up

Houston, which is the easiest shot

for a single shooter in the Book

Depository, but they wait till he

gets to the killing zone between

three rifles.  Kennedy makes the

final turn from Houston onto Elm,

slowing down to some 11 miles per

hour.

JIM (V.O.)

The shooters across Dealey Plaza

tighten, taking their aim across

their sights...  waiting for the

radio to say "Green Green!" or "Abort

Abort!"

JIM (V.O.)

The first shot rings out.

JIM (V.O.)

Sounding like a backfire, it misses

completely... Frame 161, Kennedy

stops waving as he hears something.

Connally turns his head slightly to

the right.

JIM (V.O.)

Frame 193 - the second shot hits

Kennedy in the throat from the front.

Frame 225 - the President emerging

from the road sign.  He obviously

has been hit, raising his arms to

his throat.

JIM

Frame 232, the third shot - the

President has been hit in the back,

drawing him downward and forward.

Connally, you will notice, shows no

signs at all of being hit.  He is

visibly holding his Stetson which is

impossible if his wrist has been

shattered.

JIM (V.O.)

Connally's turning now here.  Frame

238... the fourth shot misses Kennedy

and takes Connally in the back.

This is the key shot that proves two

rifles from the rear.  This is 1.6

seconds after the third shot, and we

know no manual bolt action rifle can

be recycled in that time.  Connally

is hit, his mouth drops, he yells

out, "My God, they're going to kill

us all"... Here...

JIM (V.O.)

...the umbrella man is signalling

"He's not dead.  Keep shooting."

James Tague down at the underpass is

hit sometime now by another shot

that misses.

JIM (V.O.)

The car brakes.  The fifth and fatal

shot - frame 313 - takes Kennedy in

the head from the front...

JIM (V.O.)

This is the key shot.  Watch it again.

The President going back to his left.

Shot from the front and right.

Totally inconsistent with the shot

from the Depository.  Again -

(repeats)... back and two the left.

(he repeats it like a mantra)...

back and to the left...  back and to

the left.

JIM (V.O.)

What happens then?  Pandemonium.

The shooters quickly disassemble

their various weapons, all except

the Oswald rifle.

JIM (V.O.)

Patrolman Joe Smith rushed into the

parking lot behind the fence.  He

smelled gunpowder.

SMITH (V.O.)

...the character produces credentials

from his pocket which showed him to

be Secret Service.  So I accepted

that and let him go and continued

our search.  But I regretted it,

'cause this guy looked like an auto

mechanic.  He had on a sports shirt

and pants, but he had dirty

fingernails.  Afterwards it didn't

ring true, but at the time we were

so pressed for time.

JIM (V.O.)

Yet all Secret Servicemen in Dallas

that day are accounted for.  None

were on foot in Dealey Plaza before

or after the shooting, till Dallas

Secret Service Chief Forrest Sorrels

returned at 12:55.

JIM

(pausing for effect)

What else was going on in Dealey

Plaza that day?  At least 12 other

individuals were taken into custody

by Dallas police.  No records of

their arrests.  Men acting like hoboes

were being pulled off trains, marched

through Dealey Plaza, photographed,

and yet there is no records of their

arrests.

JIM (V.O.)

Men identifying themselves as Secret

Service Agents were all over the

place.  But who was impersonating

them?

JIM (V.O.)

And where was Lee Oswald?  Probably

in the second floor snack room.

Eddie Piper and William Shelly saw

Oswald eating lunch in the first

floor lunch room around twelve.

Around 12:15, on her way out of the

building to see the motorcade,

secretary Carolyn Arnold saw Oswald

in the second floor snack room, where

he said he went for a Coke...

CAROLYN ARNOLD (V.O.)

He was sitting in one of the booths

on the right hand side of the room.

He was alone as usual and appeared

to be having lunch.  I did not speak

to him but I recognized clearly.  I

remember it was 12:15 or later.  It

coulda been 12:25, five minutes before

the assassination, I don't exactly

remember.  I was pregnant and I had

a craving for a glass of water.

JIM

(VO)

At the same time, Bonnie Ray Williams

is supposedly eating his chicken

lunch on the sixth floor, at least

until 12:15, maybe 12:20 ... he sees

nobody.

JIM (V.O.)

Down on the street, Arnold Rowland

was seeing two men in the sixth floor

windows... presumably after Bonnie

Ray Williams finished his lunch and

left.

JIM (V.O.)

Kennedy was running five minutes

late for his appointment with death.

He was due at 12:25.  If Oswald was

the assassin, he was certainly pretty

non-chalant about getting himself

into position.  Later he told Dallas

police he was standing in the second

floor snackroom.  Probably told to

wait there for a phone call by his

handler.  The phones were in the

adjacent and empty second floor

offices, but the call never came.  A

maximum 90 seconds after Kennedy is

shot, patrolman Marrion Baker runs

into Oswald in that second story

lunchroom.

BAKER

Hey you!

(to Truly)

Do you know this man?  Is he an

employee?

TRULY

Yes he is.

(as Baker moves on)

The President's been shot!

JIM (V.O.)

...but what the Warren Report would

have us believe is that after firing

3 bolt action shots in 5.6 seconds,

Oswald then leaves three cartridges

neatly side by side in the firing

nest, wipes the rifle clear of

fingerprints, stashes the rifle on

the other side of the loft, sprints

down five flights of stairs, past

witnesses Victoria Adams and Sandra

Styles who never see him, and then

shows up cool and calm on the second

floor in front of Patrolman Baker -

all this within a maximum 90 seconds

of the shooting.  Is he out of breath?

According to Baker, absolutely not.

JIM (V.O.)

Assuming he is the sole assassin,

Oswald is now free to escape from

the building.  The longer he delays,

the more chance the building will be

sealed by the police.  Is he guilty?

Does he walk out the nearest

staircase?  No, he buys a Coke and

at a slow pace, spotted by Mrs. Reid

in the second floor office, he strolls

out the more distant front exit,

where the cops start to gather...

JIM (V.O.)

Oddly, considering three shots are

supposed to have come from there,

nobody seals the Depository for ten

more minutes.  Oswald slips out, as

do several other employees.  Of

course, when he realized something

had gone wrong and the President

really had been shot, he knew there

was a problem.  He may even have

known he was the patsy.  An intuition

maybe - the President killed in spite

of his warning.  The phone call that

never came.  Perhaps fear now came

to Lee Oswald.  He wasn't going to

stand around for roll call.

JIM

The story gets pretty confusing now -

more twists in it than a watersnake.

Richard Carr says he saw four men

take off from the Book Depository in

a Rambler that possibly belongs to

Janet Williams.  Deputy Roger Craig

says two men picked up Oswald in the

same Rambler a few minutes later.

Other people say Oswald took a bus

out of there, and then because he

was stuck in traffic, he hopped a

cab to his rooming house in Oak

Cliff...

JIM (V.O.)

...we must assume he wanted to get

back in touch with his intell team,

probably at a safehouse or at the

Texas Theatre, but how could he be

sure?  He didn't know who to trust

anymore...

ROBERTS

(watching TV)

My God, did you see that, Mr. Lee?

A man shot the President.

JIM (V.O.)

Oswald returns to this rooming house

around 1 P.M., half hour after the

assassination, puts on his jacket,

grabs his .38 revolver, leaves at

1:04... Earlene Roberts, the

housekeeper, says she heard two beeps

on a car horn and two uniformed cops

pulled up to the house while Oswald

was in his room, like it was a signal

or something... Officer Tippit is

shot between 1:10 and 1:15 about a

mile away.  Though no one actually

saw him walking or jogging, the

Government says Oswald covered that

distance.  Incidentally, that walk,

if he did it, is in a straight line

toward Jack Ruby's house.  Giving

the government the benefit of the

doubt, Oswald would have had to jog

a mile in six to eleven minutes and

commit the murder, then reverse

direction and walk 3/5 of a mile to

the Texas Theatre and arrive sometime

before 1:30.  That's some walking.

JIM (V.O.)

It's also a useful conclusion.  After

all, why else would Oswald kill

Officer Tippit, unless he just shot

the President and feared arrest?

Not one credible witness could

identify Oswald as Tippit's killer.

JIM (V.O.)

Domingo Benavides, the closest witness

to the shooting, refused to identify

Oswald as the killer and was never

taken to a lineup.

JIM (V.O.)

Acquilla Clemons saw the killer with

another man and says they went off

in separate directions.  Mrs. Clemons

was never taken to lineup or to the

Warren Commission.  Mr.  Frank Wright,

who saw the killer run away, stated

flatly that the killer was not Lee

Oswald.  Oswald is found with a .38

revolver.  Tippit is killed with a

.38 automatic.  At the scene of the

crime Officer J.M. Poe marks the

shells with his initials to record

the chain of evidence.

JIM (V.O.)

Those initials are not on the three

cartridge cases which the Warren

Commission presents to him.

JIM (V.O.)

Oswald is next seen by shoe salesman

Johnny Brewer lurking along Jefferson

Avenue.  Oswald is scared.  He begins

to realize the full implications of

this thing.  He goes into the Texas

Theatre, possibly his prearranged

meeting point, but though he has $14

in his pocket, he does not buy the

75-cent ticket.  Brewer has the

cashier call the police.

JIM (V.O.)

In response to the cashier's call,

at least thirty officers in a fleet

of patrol cars descend on the movie

theatre.  This has to be the most

remarkable example of police intuition

since the Reichstag fire.  I don't

buy it.  They knew - someone knew -

Oswald was going to be there.  In

fact, as early as 12:44, only 14

minutes after the assassination, the

police radio put out a description

matching Oswald's size and build.

Brewer says the man was wearing a

jacket, but the police say the man

who shot Tippit left his jacket

behind.  Butch Burroughs, theatre

manager, says Oswald bought some

popcorn from him at the time of the

Tippit slaying.  Burroughs and witness

Bernard Haire also said there was an

Oswald look - alike taken from the

theatre.  Perhaps it was he who

sneaked into the theatre just after

1:30.

JIM (V.O.)

In any case, Brewer helpfully leads

the cops into the theatre and from

the stage points Oswald out...

OSWALD

This is it!

POLICEMAN

Kill the President, will you?

JIM (V.O.)

The cops have their man!  It was

already been decided - in Washington.

CROWD

Kill him!  Kill him!

JIM (V.O.)

Dr. Best, Himmler's right hand man

in the Gestapo, once said "as long

as the police carries out the will

of the leadership, it is acting

legally."  That mindset allowed for

400 political murders in the Weimar

Republic of 1923 - 32, where the

courts were controlled and the guilty

acquitted.  Oswald must've felt like

Josef K in Kafka's "The Trial".  He

was never told the reason of his

arrest, he does not know the unseen

forces ranging against him, he cries

out his outrage in the police lineup

just like Josef K excoriates the

judge for not being told the charges

against him.  But the state is deaf.

The quarry is caught.  By the time

he is brought from the theatre, a

large crowd is waiting to scream at

him.  By the time he reaches police

headquarters, he is booked for

murdering Tippit...

JIM (V.O.)

No legal counsel is provided.  No

record made of the long questioning.

HIGH OFFICIAL VOICE

Howdy there, Cap'n.  Thanks for taking

care of us down in Dallas.  Lady

Bird and I will always be grateful.

FRITZ

Thank you, Mr. President.  We're

doing our best.

HIGH OFFICIAL VOICE

Cap'n, I know you're working like a

hound dog down there to get this

mess wrapped up, but I gotta tell

you there's too much confusion coming

out of Dallas now.  The TVs and the

papers are full of rumour 'bout

conspiracies.  Two gunmen, two rifles,

the Russkies done it, the Cubans

done it, that kinda loose talk, it's

carin' the shit outta people, bubba'.

This thing could lead us into a war

that could cost 40 million lives.

We got to show'em we got this thing

under control.  No question, no

doubts, for the good of our country...

you hear me?

FRITZ

Yes, sir.

HIGH OFFICIAL VOICE

Cap'n, you got your man, the

investigation's over, that's what

people want to hear.

OSWALD

Now everyone will know who I am.

JIM (V.O.)

By the time the sun rose the next

morning, he is booked for murdering

the President.  The whole country -

fueled by the media - assumes he's

guilty.

JIM (V.O.)

Under the guise of a patriotic

nightclub owner out to spare Jackie

Kennedy from having to testify at a

trial, Jack Ruby is shown into the

underground garage by one of his

inside men on the Dallas Police Force,

and when he's ready Oswald is brought

out like a sacrificial lamb and nicely

disposed of as an enemy of the people.

By early Sunday afternoon, the autopsy

has been completed on him.  Who

grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald?  Buried

in a cheap grave under the name

"Oswald"?  No one.

JIM (V.O.)

Within minutes false statements and

press leaks about Lee Oswald circulate

the globe.

JIM

The Official Legend is created and

the media takes it from there.  The

glitter of official lies and the

epic splendor of the thought-numbing

funeral of J.F.K. confuse the eye

and confound the understanding.

Hitler always said "the bigger the

lie, the more people will believe

it."  Lee Oswald - a crazed, lonely

man who wanted attention and got it

by killing a President, was only the

first in a long line of patsies.  In

later years Bobby Kennedy and Martin

Luther King, men whose commitment to

change and to peace would make them

dangerous to men who are committed

to war, would follow, also killed by

such "lonely, crazed men," who remove

our guilt by making murder a

meaningless act of a loner.  We have

all become Hamlets in our country -

children of a slain father - leader

whose killers still possess the

throne.  The ghost of John F. Kennedy

confronts us with the secret murder

at the heart of the American dream.

He forces on us the appalling

questions:  Of what is our

Constitution made?  What is our

citizenship, and more, our lives

worth?  What is the future of a

democracy where a President can be

assassinated under conspicuously

suspicious circumstances while the

machinery of legal action scarcely

trembles?  How many political murders,

disguised as heart attacks, cancer,

suicides, airplane and car crashes,

drug overdoses will occur before

they are exposed for what they are?

JIM

"Treason doth never prosper," wrote

an English poet, "What's the reason?

For if it prosper, none dare call it

treason."  The generals who sent

Dreyfus to Devils Island were among

the most honorable men in France,

the men who killed Caesar were among

the most honorable men in Rome.  And

the men who killed Kennedy, no doubt,

were honorable men.  I believe we

have reached a time in our country,

similar to what life must've been

like under Hitler in the 30's, except

we don't realize it because Fascism

in our country takes the benign

disguise of liberal democracy.  There

won't be such familiar signs as

swastikas.  We won't build Dachaus

and Auschwitzes.  We're not going to

wake up one morning and suddenly

find ourselves in gray uniforms goose -

stepping off to work ... "Fascism

will come," Huey Long once said. "in

the name of anti-fascism" - it will

come in the name of your security -

they call it "National Security," it

will come with the mass media

manipulating a clever concentration

camp of the mind.  The super state

will provide you tranquility above

the truth, the super state will make

you believe you are living in the

best of all possible worlds, and in

order to do so will rewrite history

as it sees fit.  George Orwell's

Ministry of Truth warned us, "Who

controls the past, controls the

future."

JIM

The American people have yet to see

the Zapruder film.  Why?  The American

people have yet to see the real

photographs and X - rays of the

autopsy.  Why?  There are hundreds

of documents that could help prove

this conspiracy.  Why have they been

withheld or burned by the Government?

Each time my office or you the people

have asked those questions, demanded

crucial evidence, the answer from on

high has been "national security."

What kind of "national security" do

we have when we have been robbed of

our leaders?  Who determines our

"national security"?  What "national

security" permits the removal of

fundamental power from the hands of

the American people and validates

the ascendancy of invisible government

in the United States?  That kind of

"national security," gentlemen of

the jury, is when it smells like it,

feels like it, and looks like it,

you call it what it is - it's Fascism!

I submit to you that what took place

on November 22, 1963 was a coup

d'etat.  Its most direct and tragic

result was a reversal of President

Kennedy's commitment to withdraw

from Vietnam.  War is the biggest

business in America worth $80 billion

a year.  The President was murdered

by a conspiracy planned in advance

at the highest levels of the United

States government and carried out by

fanatical and disciplined Cold

Warriors in the Pentagon and CIA's

covert operations apparatus - among

them Clay Shaw here before you.  It

was a public execution and it was

covered up by like - minded

individuals in the Dallas Police

Department, the Secret Service, the

FBI, and the White House - all the

way up to and including J. Edgar

Hoover and Lyndon Johnson, whom I

consider accomplices after the fact.

JIM (V.O.)

There is a very simple way to

determine if I am being paranoid

here.

(laughter)

Let's ask the two men who have

profited the most from the

assassination - your former President

Lyndon Baines Johnson and your new

President, Richard Nixon - to release

51 CIA documents pertaining to Lee

Oswald and Jack Ruby, or the secret

CIA memo on Oswald's activities in

Russia that was "destroyed" while

being photocopied.  All these

documents are yours - the people's

property - you pay for it, but because

the government considers you children

who might be too disturbed to face

this reality, because you might lynch

those involved, you cannot see these

documents for another 75 years.  I'm

in my 40's, so I'll have shuffled

off this mortal coil by then, but

I'm already telling my 8 year - old

son to keep himself physically fit

so that one glorious September morning

in 2038 he can walk into the National

Archives and find out what the CIA

and the FBI knew.  They may even

push it back then.  It may become a

generational affair, with questions

passed down from father to son, mother

to daughter, in the manner of the

ancient runic bards.  Someday

somewhere, someone might find out

the damned Truth.  Or we might just

build ourselves a new Government

like the Declaration of Independence

says we should do when the old one

ain't working - maybe a little farther

out West.

JIM

An American naturalist wrote, "a

patriot must always be ready to defend

his country against its government."

Well, I'd hate to be in your shoes

today.  You have a lot to think about.

Going back to when we were children,

I think most of us in this courtroom

thought that justice came into being

automatically, that virtue was its

own reward, that good would triumph

over evil.  But as we get older we

know that this just isn't true.

"The frontier is where a man faces a

fact."  Individual human beings have

to create justice and this is not

easy because truth often presents a

threat to power and we have to fight

power often at great risk to

ourselves.  People like Julia Ann

Mercer, S.M. Holland, Lee Bowers,

Jean Hill, and Willie O'Keefe have

come forward and taken that risk.

(he produces a stack

of letters)

I have here some $8000 in these

letters sent to my office from all

over the country - quarters, dimes,

dollar bills from housewives,

plumbers, car salesmen, teachers,

invalids ... These are the people

who cannot afford to send money but

do, these are the ones who drive the

cabs, who nurse in the hospitals,

who see their kids go to Vietnam.

Why?  Because they care, because

they want to know the truth - because

they want their country back, because

it belongs to us the people as long

as the people got the guts to fight

for what they believe in!  The truth

is the most important value we have

because if the truth does not endure,

if the Government murders truth, if

you cannot respect the hearts of

these people...

(shaking the letters)

...then this is no longer the country

in which we were born in and this is

not the country I want to die in...

And this was never more true than

for John F. Kennedy whose murder was

probably the most terrible moment in

the history of our country.  You the

people, you the jury system, in

sitting in judgement on Clay Shaw,

represent the hope of humanity against

Government power.  In discharging

your duty, in bringing the first

conviction in this house of cards

against Clay Shaw, "Ask not what

your country can do for you, but

what you can do for your country."

Do not forget your young President

who forfeited his life.  Show the

world this is still a government of

the people, for the people, and by

the people.  Nothing as long as you

live will ever be more important.

(he stares into the

camera)

It's up to you.

JURY FOREMAN

We find Clay Shaw... not guilty on

all counts.

FOREMAN

We believe there was a conspiracy,

but whether Clay Shaw was a part of

it is another kettle of fish.

ENGLISH REPORTER

Mr. Garrison, the American media is

reporting this as a full vindication

of the Warren Commission, do you...

JIM

I think all it proves is you cannot

run a trial even questioning the

intelligence operations of the

government in the light of day.

NEWSMAN 13

We understand that The Times -

Picayune will call for your

resignation - unfit to hold office.

You've ruined Clay Shaw's reputation -

are you going to resign?

JIM

Hell, no.  I'm gonna run again.  And

I'm gonna win.  Thank you very much.

If it takes me 30 years to nail every

one of the assassins, then I will

continue this investigation for 30

years.  I owe that not only to Jack

Kennedy, but to my country.

JIM

Well, thanks for coming.

X

You didn't get that break you needed,

but you went as far as any man could,

bubba.

(he sits next to Jim)

What can I do for you?

JIM

Just speculating, I guess.  How do

you think it started?

X

I think it started in the wind.

Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon

people, contractors, bankers,

politicians like L.B.J. were committed

to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early

as '61 they knew Kennedy was going

to change things... He was not going

to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows?

Probably some boardroom or lunchroom

somewhere - Houston, New York - hell,

maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows,

it's international now.

X (V.O.)

One worried sonofabitch with a few

million dollars turns to the others...

with a few million dollars... and

says something pretty direct like...

RICH MAN 1

The sonofabitch is gonna get re-

elected by a bigger vote than ever

in '64.  It's gonna be worse than

Roosevelt.  The country won't survive

as we know it.

RICH MAN 2

I agree, Bob, it can't go on.

(he looks to Man 3)

RICH MAN 3

...and Bobby in '68?  Something's

got to be done.

RICH MAN 1

He's gotta go, Lou.  The election's

gotta be stopped.

RICH MAN 1

I talk to a lot of people.  I know

I'm not the only one thinking this.

RICH MAN 2

What's the feeling in Washington,

Jack?

X (V.O.)

...so calls are made.  Down to

Washington.  All over the world.

They start talking about it.  A few

people here, there.  Just

conversations, nothing more...

X (V.O.)

Generals, Admirals, CIA people, and

probably some people on the inside

of Kennedy's staff - young, brilliant

Judases, ready to go to war in

Southeast Asia...

X (V.O.)

...and maybe a Vice-President getting

separate memos from Vietnam, eager

to get his backers the billions of

dollars in contracts for Southeast

Asia...

X (V.O.)

Kennedy, like Caesar, is surrounded

with enemies.  Something is underway

but it has no face.  Yet everyone in

the loop knows...

X (V.O.)

Money is at stake.  Big money.  A

hundred billion.  The Kennedy brothers

target voting districts for defense

dollars.  They give TFX fighter

contracts only to the counties that

are going to make a difference in

'64.  These people fight back.  Their

way.  One day another call is made...

X (V.O.)

...maybe to somebody like my superior

who's been running the "Mongoose"

program out of Florida and who has

no love for Kennedy.

VOICE ON PHONE

Bill, we're going.  We need your

help.

X (V.O.)

Everything's cellurized.  No one has

said "he must die," there's been no

vote, there's nothing on paper,

there's no one to blame.  It's as

old as the Crucifixion: the Mafia

firing squad, one blank, no one's

guilty because everyone in the Power

Structure who knows anything has a

plausible deniability.  There are no

compromising connections except at

the most secret point.  But what's

paramount is that it must succeed.

No matter how many die, how much it

costs, the perpetrators must be on

the winning side and never subject

to prosecution for anything by anyone.

That is a coup d'etat.

Y

(into phone)

When?

VOICE ON PHONE

In the fall.  Probably in the south.

We want you to come up with a plan...

X

He's done it before.  Other countries.

Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the

Dominican Republic, he's working on

Castro.  No big deal.  In September,

Kennedy announces the Texas trip.

At that moment, second Oswalds start

popping up all over Dallas where

they have the mayor and the cops in

their pocket.  Y flies in the

assassins, maybe from the special

camp we keep outside Athens, Greece -

pros, maybe some locals, Cubans,

Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it

really matter who shot from what

rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The

assassins by now are dead or well

paid and long gone...

JIM

Any chance of one of them confessing

someday?

X

...don't think so.  When they start

to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These

guys are proud of what they did.

They did Dealey Plaza!  They took

out the President of the United

States!  That's entertainment!  And

they served their country doing it.

JIM

(in present)

...and your General?

X

...got promoted to two stars, but he

was never military, you know, always

CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his

credibility when we got beat over

there, retired, lives in Virginia.

I say hello to him when I see him at

the supermarket...

JIM

Ever ask him?

X

You never ask a spook a question.

No point.  He'll never give you a

straight answer.  General Y still

thinks of himself of the handsome

young warrior who loved this country

but loved the concept of war more.

JIM

His name?

X

Does it matter?  Another technician.

But an interesting thing - he was

there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You

know how I know?

(Jim shakes his head)

That picture of yours.  The hoboes...

you never looked deep enough...

X (V.O.)

I knew the man 20 years.  That's

him.  The way he walked... arms at

his side, military, the stoop, the

haircut, the twisted left hand, the

large class ring.  What was he doing

there?  If anyone had asked him,

he'd probably say "protection" but

I'll tell you I think he was giving

some kind of "okay" signal to those

hoboes - they're about to get booked

and he's telling 'em it's gonna be

okay, they're covered.  And in fact

they were - you never heard of them

again.

JIM

...some story... the whole thing.

It's like it never happened.

X

It never did.

(he smiles tartly)

JIM

Just think... just think.  What

happened to our country .. to the

world...  because of that murder...

Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown

of law, drugs, thought control, guilt,

assassinations, secret government

fear of the frontier...

X

I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday

the 26th, the day after they buried

Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the

memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador

Lodge.

JOHNSON

Gentlemen, I want you to know I'm

not going to let Vietnam go the way

China did.  I'm personally committed.

I'm not going to take one soldier

out of there 'til they know we mean

business in Asia...

(he pauses)

You just get me elected, and I'll

give you your damned war.

X (V.O.)

...and that was the day Vietnam

started.
