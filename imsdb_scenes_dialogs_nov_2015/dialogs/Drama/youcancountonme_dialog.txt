SHOOTING DRAFT

2000

MRS. PRESCOTT

Why do they always put braces on

teenage girls at the exact moment

when they're the most self-conscious

about their appearance?

MR. PRESCOTT

I don't know.

MRS. PRESCOTT

Tom --

MR. PRESCOTT

I see him...

MRS. PRESCOTT

Tom!

MR. PRESCOTT

Jesus!

MRS. PRESCOTT

(Screams)

Tom!

CUT TO:

SHERIFF

Hello, Amy.

AMY

(Puzzled)

Hi, Darryl.

SHERIFF

(Thinking)

Amy, would you please tell the kids

you'll be right back, and then shut

the door and come outside to talk to

us for a minute?

AMY

OK.

(To kids)

Be right back, you guys!

SAMMY

You're not supposed to go out, Amy.

TERRY

She's going to smoke a cigarette.

DISSOLVE TO:

SAMMY

Rudy, come on! I'm really late!

SAMMY

How was school?

RUDY

Stupid.

SAMMY

Why do you say that?

RUDY

We're supposed to write a story for

English homework, but they didn't

tell us what it's supposed to be

about.

SAMMY

What do you mean?

RUDY

I mean they didn't tell us what it's

supposed to be about. They said do

whatever you want.

SAMMY

So what's wrong with that?

RUDY

Nothing. I just think it's

unstructured.

SAMMY

(Smiles)

Well, I'm sure you'll be able to

think of something. If you can't,

I'll help you.

SAMMY

Don't forget your backpack.

RUDY

It's not a backpack, it's a knapsack.

SAMMY

Don't forget your knapsack.

SAMMY

Give me a kiss.

MABEL

Guess who's been asking for you?

SAMMY

Oh no, really?

BRIAN

(Inside)

Yeah, come in!

SAMMY

Mr. Everett?

BRIAN

Yeah: Brian.

SAMMY

Brian. Hi. I'm Samantha Prescott --

I'm the lending officer?

BRIAN

Yeah, hi, how are you? Come on in.

Sit down.

SAMMY

I am so sorry I was late...

BRIAN

Yeah, we missed you before...

SAMMY

I got held up. Believe me, it is not

something I make a habit of...

BRIAN

I'm sure it's not. Actually -- could

you just, could you close that door

for me? Thanks.

SAMMY

-- so I always just run out at 3:15

to pick him up and then run him real

quick over to the sitter's house.

Anyway, Larry never minded about it

and I was just hoping it would be OK

with you too...

BRIAN

Well -- Samantha -- I realize that

Scottsville is not exactly a major

banking center...

SAMMY

No it's not...

BRIAN

No -- I know it's not... But it's

kind of a personal challenge to me

to see what we can do to bring local

service up to the same kinds of

standards we'd be trying to meet if

we were the biggest branch in the

state. And that means I don't want

anybody running out at 3:15 or 3:30,

or whenever the bus happens to come

in that day. Now is there anybody

else who can pick your son up after

school? Does your husband work in

the area? Do you --

SAMMY

Oh -- No -- Rudy Sr. isn't "on the

scene." So to speak.

BRIAN

Well, I can give you a couple of

days to make some other arrangement,

but...

SAMMY

Well -- Brian? I understand what

you're saying, and I think it's great.

I do. Because there's a lot of things

around here that could use some

attention. Believe me. But I've

honestly been meeting that bus every

day for four years now and it really

does take just fifteen minutes, and

if I take the time out of my lunch

hour...

BRIAN

I'd really prefer it if you would

make some other arrangement. OK?

SAMMY

(Brightly)

I'll do my best...!

BRIAN

How old's your son?

SAMMY

He's eight.

BRIAN

That's a terrific age.

RUDY

You got a letter from Uncle Terry.

SAMMY

What?!

RUDY

Whose room is he gonna stay in?

SAMMY

He can stay in the little room.

(Pause)

But you know what? He's not going to

live here. He's only gonna stay for

a little while... And it's OK if you

don't remember him, because you were

only six the last time he was here...

But it'll be nice if you got a chance

to get to know each other a little

bit. Don't you think?

SAMMY

Rudy? Would it distract you if I put

on some music?

RUDY

No.

SAMMY

Did you think of a story?

RUDY

Uh huh.

SAMMY

What's it about?

RUDY

My father.

SAMMY

What about your father?

RUDY

It's just a made-up story about him.

SAMMY

Can I read it when you're done?

RUDY

It's not very good.

SAMMY

Don't say that.

SAMMY

Anyway, Bob, it's sort of this

adventure story, and Rudy's father

is this secret agent or something,

working for the government... And it

just made me feel weird. You know?

Because I never really say much to

him about Rudy Sr., because I don't

know what to say. And I don't know

whether I should just let him imagine

whatever he wants to imagine, or

whether I should sit him down sometime

and tell him, you know, that his

father is not such a nice person.

You know?

BOB

Well... I don't know, Sammy. What

have you told him already?

SAMMY

Not much. He knows I don't have the

highest opinion of him. And he knows

I don't want to see him or know

anything about him, ever. But I tried

to keep it kind of neutral. Anyway...

I could go into a lot more detail,

believe me.

BOB

Well... It's an interesting problem.

But I don't really know what to tell

you... It's a little outside my

personal field of expertise...

SAMMY

All right.

BOB

I'd be glad to give it some thought...

SAMMY

OK.

SAMMY

What?

BOB

Nothing... I'm just glad to see you...

I'm glad you called me.

SAMMY

I bet you were surprised...!

BOB

Um -- a little.

SAMMY

I should get going...

BOB

Really?

SAMMY

Yeah... I've got the baby-sitter...

But... Thanks for a lovely evening.

BOB

Oh. Thank you.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHEILA

Hey, Terry.

TERRY

Hey.

SHEILA

Where'd you get the hat?

TERRY

Oh, I got it on the street for a

dollar.

SHEILA

It's nice.

TERRY

Well, you know, it's pretty much

your standard woolen hat.

SHEILA

Yeah, I had a very similar reaction

to it.

TERRY

Can I get that money from you?

SHEILA

Yeah. Sorry.

TERRY

Is that all you have?

SHEILA

Yeah.

TERRY

Can you borrow some cash from your

brother?

SHEILA

Um, yeah, but that would involve

speaking to him.

TERRY

Well, I'm definitely gonna be gone

for a couple of days at least, Sheila.

SHEILA

Why do you have to stay so long?

TERRY

Because my sister is not a bank, you

know? I can't just show up and ask

her for --

SHEILA

You seem to think my brother's a

bank!

TERRY

Oh Sheila can we just cut out the

puerile crap?! I'll be back just as

soon as I can. OK? I am not the kind

of man that everyone says I am.

SHEILA

I know you're not.

TERRY

I'll call you tonight.

SHEILA

Don't you wanna tell me you love me?

TERRY

I love you.

SHEILA

That was really convincing.

TERRY

Well... I think after this is over

you should seriously consider moving

back home.

SHEILA

(Short laugh)

Oh, yeah.

TERRY

(Gives up)

All right...

SHEILA

You gonna call tonight?

TERRY

Definitely.

SAMMY

(Into phone)

Hello?... TERRY!...

SHERIFF

Whoa there!

TERRY

Sorry.

SHERIFF

God damn! Terry Prescott! How you

doin'? Gimme a cuddle!

TERRY

How you doin', Darryl?

SHERIFF

Which way you headed?

TERRY

I'm just goin' to see Sammy at

Dawson's...

SHERIFF

Can I walk with you a little?

TERRY

Sure, yeah --

SHERIFF

So Sammy says you been out in

Alaska...?

TERRY

Yeah, I was workin' out there for a

little while...

SHERIFF

-- Sammy says she's gettin' postcards

from all across the country.

TERRY

Yeah, I've been all over the place...

SHERIFF

Well, it's good to have you back

here, I'll tell you that.

TERRY

Thanks, Darryl. Keep enforcing the

peace.

SHERIFF

Well, that'll be a little harder now

that you're home, but I'll do what I

can.

TERRY

No, man, I'm reformed.

SHERIFF

Oh, yeah. Good to see you, kid.

TERRY

Thanks, Darryl.

TERRY

Sorry about yesterday --

SAMMY

I don't care --

TERRY

I was studying the bus description...

and I just... I got on the wrong bus --

I mean I missed my stop --

SAMMY

I don't care, Terry. I'm just so

glad to see you...!

TERRY

I'm glad to see you too, Sammy. Um...

are you coming from work?

SAMMY

Um, no, it's Saturday...

TERRY

Yeah, no, it's just... you're dressed

so formally...

SAMMY

Oh. No. You know, I just thought I'd --

You know I thought it was a special

occasion... which it is...

TERRY

No, it's good. I thought I'd dress

up too.

SAMMY

That's OK. You look fine.

TERRY

(A strange,

unsuccessful joke)

Yeah, this is the haute cuisine of

garments.

SAMMY

What?

TERRY

Nothing, nothing... Um... So how are

you?

SAMMY

I'm fine.

TERRY

How's Rudy?

SAMMY

We're fine, Terry. How are you?

(Pause)

I mean --

TERRY

Yeah...

SAMMY

-- Where have you been lately, Terry?

TERRY

-- I know, I haven't been --

SAMMY

I got a postcard from you from

Alaska...?

TERRY

Yeah, I was up there for a while...

SAMMY

But that was in the Fall, Terry...

TERRY

Yeah, I know I've been out of touch...

SAMMY

I was a little worried.

(Pause)

I mean --

TERRY

Oh, I been a lotta different places...

Um... I went down to Florida for a

while... I was doing some work in

Orlando... I've been all over the

place.

SAMMY

Well... I just wish you would have

let me know you were OK...

TERRY

Yeah. I didn't realize it'd been so

long...

SAMMY

(Beaming again)

Are you gonna stay in town for a

while?

TERRY

Well, I don't know... I got all these

things I gotta do back in Worcester...

SAMMY

Oh...

TERRY

...Yeah, so I'm probably not gonna

be able to stay more than a day or

so...

SAMMY

Oh... Well... That's all right...!

TERRY

...I'm kind of trying to keep to a

schedule of sorts. It's a long and

worthy story but I won't trouble you

with it right now.

SAMMY

Are you expecting someone?

TERRY

Who would I be expecting here?

SAMMY

You just keep looking around, that's

all.

TERRY

No, I was just wondering if we could

get some more refreshments, actually.

TERRY

I've actually got to confess to you,

Sammy... that the reason you may not

have heard from me for a little while

is that I've been kind of unable to

write... on account of the fact that

I was in jail for a little while.

SAMMY

You were what?

TERRY

Well, I did a little time, I guess,

in Florida. For, uh, just for

bullshit...

SAMMY

What?!

TERRY

It was just bullshit...

SAMMY

What did you do?

TERRY

I didn't do anything. Does it occur

to you that maybe I was wronged?

SAMMY

No!

TERRY

Well, could I please --

SAMMY

Oh my God! --

TERRY

Would you please let me --

SAMMY

-- What happened?!

TERRY

I got into a fight in a bar down in

Florida. Which I was not the one who

instigated it, at all. But they worked

up all this bullshit against me and

they threw me in the pen for three

months. I didn't write you because I

didn't want you to get all upset

about it. I just figured you'd figure

I was on the road for a little while.

I know it was stupid and I'm sorry.

I really didn't mean to make you

worry. But you know what? I can't

run around all the time doin' stuff

or not doin' stuff because it's gonna

make you worry! Because then I come

back here, and I tell you about my

fuckin'... traumas, and I get this

wounded little "I've Let You Down"

bullshit, over and over again, and

it really just -- cramps me! Like I

just want to get out from under it!...

And here I am back in this fuckin'

hole explaining myself to you again!

SAMMY

OK -- Can you please stop cursing at

me?

TERRY

I mean, I realize I'm in no position

to, uh, basically say anything, ever --

But it's not like I'm down there in

some redneck bar in Florida having

an argument with some stripper's

boyfriend and I suddenly think, "Hey!

Maybe this'd be a good time to really

stick it to Sammy and get myself

locked up for a few months."

SAMMY

I'm sorry.

TERRY

Me too, man. I mean "welcome home."

SAMMY

Hey -- You don't write me for six

months, I have no idea where you are --

TERRY

I'm sorry --

SAMMY

-- I don't know if you're alive or

dead --

TERRY

I'm sorry --

SAMMY

-- and then you show up out of nowhere

and tell me you were in jail?

TERRY

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

Sammy, I'm really sorry...!

TERRY

Sammy...

SAMMY

What?

TERRY

Um... I'm in the midst of a slight

predicament...

SAMMY

What do you need? Money?

TERRY

Um... Yeah... I'm broke. I gotta get

back to Worcester tomorrow. I got

this girl there, and she's kind of

in a bad situation...? I just need

to borrow some money. Whatever you

can spare.

(Pause)

I'll pay you back... I'll pay you

back, man.

SAMMY

I really wish Mom was here.

TERRY

So do I, man.

SAMMY

Nobody knows what to do with you.

TERRY

I know how they feel, man.

SAMMY

Terry? Can I ask you something?

TERRY

Sure.

SAMMY

(With some difficulty)

Well -- I mean, do you ever go to

church anymore?

TERRY

Come on, Sammy, can we not talk about

that shit?

SAMMY

Do you?

TERRY

Um -- No, Sammy. I don't.

SAMMY

Can you tell me why not?

TERRY

Um, yeah. Because I think it's

ridiculous.

SAMMY

Well -- can you tell me without like,

denigrating what I believe in?

TERRY

Because I think it's primitive, OK?

I think it's a fairy tale.

SAMMY

Well -- I mean, have you ever

considered that maybe that's part of

what's making things so difficult

for you?

TERRY

No.

SAMMY

-- That you've lost hold of -- well,

not just your religious feeling, but

lost hold of any kind of anchor, any

kind of trust in anything... I mean

no wonder you drift around so much.

What could ever stop you? How would

you ever know if you had found the

right thing?

TERRY

Well, uh, I'm not really looking for

anything, man. I'm just, like, trying

to get on with it.

WAITRESS

Here we go...

TERRY

Thank you, Sammy... I'm really gonna

pay this back.

TERRY

Where we going?

SAMMY

To pick up Rudy.

TERRY

Well... do you not even want me to

visit now? 'Cause I can catch the

bus at five o'clock if that's what

you want.

SAMMY

Well, of course I want you to visit,

you idiot! I've been looking forward

to seeing you more than anything!

I've been telling everyone I know

that you were coming home! I cleaned

the whole fucking house so it would

look nice for you! I thought you

were gonna stay for at least a few

days! It didn't occur to me that you

were just broke again. I wish you

would have just sent me an invoice!

TERRY

(Into phone)

Hi, is that Malcolm?... Hi, this is

Terry Prescott?... I been trying to

get ahold of Sheila and there's no

answer, and I was just wondering if

she -- She what?...

TERRY

(Into phone)

When?... Well -- Is she all right?...

Well, could I talk to her?... Well,

could you give her a message that I --

TERRY

That girl I'm with tried to kill

herself.

SAMMY

What?

TERRY

She tried to kill herself.

SAMMY

Do you have everything you need?

TERRY

I think so.

SAMMY

What are you going to do?

TERRY

I don't know. Send the money I guess.

SAMMY

Maybe you should stay home for a

little while, Terry.

TERRY

Yeah, maybe that'd be a good idea.

SAMMY

I'm going to bed. Do you have

everything you need?

TERRY

Yeah. Thanks.

SAMMY

Good night.

TERRY

Good night.

SAMMY

Terry, I'm really glad you're home.

TERRY

Yeah, me too, Sammy.

SAMMY

OK. So we'll drop Rudy off at the

bus, then all you have to do is drop

me off at the bank, and just pick

Rudy up at 3:30 in front of town

hall, and drive him over to Carol's

house. And that's it. She's on Harvey

Lane, right past where the Dewitts

used to live.

TERRY

OK.

SAMMY

Rudy knows where she lives.

TERRY

OK.

SAMMY

God, Mabel, don't those colors hurt

your eyes?

MABEL

Oh no, they keep me fresh.

BRIAN

Yeah!

(Looks up)

Hi, Sammy. What can I do for you?

SAMMY

Um, Brian? Did you want us to turn

this time sheet in at the end of the

day, or do you want it at the end of

the week...?

BRIAN

Oh, yeah, end of the day'll be fine.

SAMMY

Seems like an awful lot of extra

paperwork...

BRIAN

I like paperwork.

RUDY

You showed up.

TERRY

Looks that way.

TERRY

Put on your seat belt.

RUDY

It pushes on my neck.

TERRY

What?

RUDY

It pushes on my neck. It's

uncomfortable.

TERRY

Well, when somebody slams into us

and you go sailin' through the

windshield, that's liable to be

uncomfortable too. So put on your

seat belt.

RUDY

Mom's parents died in a car accident.

TERRY

I know. They're my parents too.

RUDY

They are?

TERRY

Well, yeah. Your mom is my sister.

RUDY

Yeah, I know.

TERRY

So that means we have the same

parents.

RUDY

Oh yeah.

MABEL

Um -- Carol just called. She said

Terry and Rudy never showed up at

her house?

SAMMY

You've got to be kidding me.

BRIAN

Hey, Sammy?

TERRY

Hey. Look.

TERRY

You hold it further down, you're

gonna get a lot more power. You should

be able to put that nail down with

two or three hits. Look:

TERRY

Try it.

RUDY

That's not the way I hold it.

TERRY

Well, the way you hold it is wrong.

RUDY

Why can't I just do it my own way?

TERRY

(Shrugs)

You can.

SAMMY

Brian? Did you want to see me?

BRIAN

Yeah. I was kind of wondering what

happened to you today.

SAMMY

Oh -- Didn't Mabel -- I had a false

alarm about my son...

BRIAN

Yeah, I kind of thought you were

gonna work that out.

SAMMY

Well, I did work it out -- more or

less --

BRIAN

Then why're you running outta here

in the middle of the day without a

word of explanation to me, Sammy?

SAMMY

Brian, don't yell at me.

BRIAN

I'm -- I'm not yelling. I'm just

gettin' a little frustrated here.

SAMMY

Well Brian:

BRIAN

Sorry, could you close the door

please?

SAMMY

...And Eddy Dwyer lives in Buffalo,

with his wife and two sons, if you

can believe it.

TERRY

That is depressing.

SAMMY

Why?

TERRY

He just never struck me as the

marrying type, that's all.

RUDY

Who are you talking about?

TERRY

Wild kids we used to know.

RUDY

Were you a wild kid?

TERRY

Not compared to your Mom.

RUDY

Yeah, right.

TERRY

You don't believe me?

RUDY

No.

TERRY

Ask her.

RUDY

Mom, were you?

SAMMY

No comment.

RUDY (O.C.)

What are you doing?

TERRY

Oh -- Just readin' some of your

compositions.

RUDY

Why are you smoking?

TERRY

Um... Because it's bad. Don't ever

do it.

RUDY

I won't.

TERRY

You know this used to be my room?

RUDY

Yeah...

(Pause)

Do you want it back?

TERRY

No.

RUDY

Did you fight in Vietnam?

TERRY

No. I wasn't even born yet.

RUDY

Were you ever in the army?

TERRY

No.

RUDY

My father was in the army.

TERRY

I know. Unfortunately he didn't fight

in Vietnam either.

RUDY

Were you friends with him?

TERRY

Not really. We had some friends in

common, I guess... I didn't like him

very much.

RUDY

Why not?

TERRY

Well, he wasn't very likable.

RUDY

Why do you say that?

TERRY

I don't know. He was always -- He

always had to be better than you at

everything. You know. Like if you

were all playing basketball or

something, everybody's havin' like a

friendly game and he's like ready to

kill somebody if his team didn't

win. Or like if you told like a joke

or a story, he always had to tell a

better one? Kinda gets annoying after

a while. Plus it was pretty scummy

how he split on your mom and you...

He was a prick. Probably still a

prick. Fortunately for you though,

your mom is like, the greatest. So

you had some bad luck and you had

some good luck.

(Pause)

You mind if I ask you a personal

question?

RUDY

I don't know.

TERRY

Do you like it here? I mean, in

Scottsville?

RUDY

Yeah...?

TERRY

Why?

RUDY

I don't know. My friends are here...

I like the scenery... I don't know.

TERRY

I know, I know, but it's so... There's

nothing to do here.

RUDY

Yes there is.

TERRY

No there isn't, man! It's narrow.

It's dull. It's a dull, narrow town

full of dull, narrow people who don't

know anything except... what things

are like right around here. They

have no perspective whatsoever. No

scope. They might as well be living

in the nineteenth century because

they have no idea what's going on,

and if you try to tell 'em that,

they wanna fuckin' kill you.

RUDY

What are you talking about?

TERRY

I don't know...

TERRY

You're a good kid.

BRIAN

Yeah. This doesn't apply to you

directly, Sammy, but I've noticed

that some of the employees have their

PC monitors set with all kinds of

crazy colors... Purple and polka

dots or what have you. And it's not

a big deal, but really, this is a

bank. You know? It's not really

appropriate. So I'm just asking that

people stick to a more quote unquote

normal range of colors in future...

BRIAN

Like I say, it doesn't really apply

to you.

SAMMY

No, my computer palette's pretty

conservative.

BOB

(Into phone)

Bob Steegerson.

SAMMY

(On phone)

What are you wearing?

BOB

(Into phone)

Mom?

SAMMY

What's up?

TERRY

Do you know you have an enormous

leak from the upstairs hall?

SAMMY

Um, yeah, thanks, I did.

SAMMY

Are you guys sure you're gonna be

OK?

TERRY

Yes. Yes.

SAMMY

What is happening here?

TERRY

It's just -- The problem is that the

pipe is corroded all the way along

the length of the hall. So every

time I put in a new piece it starts

leaking further down.

SAMMY

Why don't I just call the plumber?

TERRY

Why? He's not gonna do anything

different than what I'm doing.

RUDY

(Happily)

Yeah. We're making it worse!

TERRY

No we're not. Shut up.

SAMMY

Thank you. Thank you both.

SAMMY

Now, call if there's any problem,

and if I'm not there, I'm either on

my way or on my way back home.

TERRY

OK.

SAMMY

(To TERRY)

So lights out at ten... and don't

spend the whole night watching TV.

TERRY

Nice to meet you, Bob.

BOB

You too.

TERRY

(To SAMMY)

What's your idea of the whole night?

SAMMY

Two hours tops.

TERRY

What's your feeling about Bob?

RUDY

I don't really know him that well.

TERRY

I have bad news for you.

RUDY

No...!

RUDY

Great. What are we supposed to do

now?

TERRY

Do you know how to play pool?

RUDY

I've played it.

RUDY

I don't think they let kids in there.

TERRY

Well, we're not allowed to watch any

more TV, so it's this or nothing...

But if we run into any trouble, let

me do the talking.

RUDY

OK.

TERRY

I got a hundred bucks here says me

and my nephew can beat anybody in

here. Only we gotta get the next

game 'cause he's gotta be in bed by

ten o'clock.

TERRY

Just hit it nice and soft... Nice

and soft.

RUDY

(To TERRY)

Sorry.

TERRY

God damn, Rudy. I thought you said

you could play.

TERRY

Boys, it's all over but the cryin'.

SAMMY

Bob... Are you serious?

BOB

Yeah.

SAMMY

I... I don't know what to say. I --

BOB

I mean, I know I haven't exactly

been the most... decisive... guy. In

the past... I don't know: I'm tired

of foolin' around. And I love you.

SAMMY

I... I'm totally... I don't know

what to say.

BOB

Well, you could always say "Yes."

(Pause)

Or you could think about it first.

SAMMY

That's it: I want to think about it.

BOB

OK... Fair enough.

TERRY

Ohhhh!

TERRY

It's all yours, baby.

TERRY

Just make sure to hit it really

gentle. But firm. And hit it a little

low so you get some backspin. Don't

even hit it. Just kiss it.

RUDY

What do you mean, kiss it?

TERRY

I mean tap it. Firm but very, very

softly. And don't shoot until you

know it's going in. OK?

RUDY

OK.

TERRY

That was great!

RUDY

We creamed those guys! We creamed

them!

TERRY

(Stopping suddenly)

Ssh...! Don't move.

TERRY

It's them!

TERRY

Go! Go! Go!

TERRY

Wait a minute, gimme your jacket!

TERRY

What are you doing?

RUDY

I can't get my sleeve out...!

SAMMY

What is going on in here?

TERRY

Um -- We were just out doing some

star-gazing, and, uh, Rudy lost track

of the time. Which I totally warned

him about.

(To Rudy)

You are a bad kid.

TERRY

(In a low voice)

Hey: I think it's OK. Just don't

tell her where we went, 'cause she'll

be really mad at me. OK?

RUDY

I won't.

TERRY

(Suddenly dark)

Hey -- I'm not kidding, Rudy.

RUDY

I won't!

SAMMY

Did you know my Mommy used to take

me and Uncle Terry out at night to

look at the constellations?

RUDY

Yeah.

SAMMY

Did you see that one, what's the one --

It looks like a big "W"? Cassiopeia?

RUDY

Yeah.

SAMMY

Ow! Shit!

SAMMY

I've got a great idea. Why don't you

let me call the plumber?

TERRY

Do whatever you want.

SAMMY

Oh, does that make you mad?

TERRY

No...

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

SAMMY

Brian, get off my ass!

BRIAN

Excuse me?

SAMMY

I didn't change the colors on your

stupid computer screen.

BRIAN

Well, that's all you gotta say!

SAMMY

(On "that's")

There is nothing wrong with the work

I do here. I have been doing just

fine, the whole time before you came

here -- And if you think that riding

people in this petty, ridiculous way

is the way to improve service in

this bank or anywhere else I think

you're out of your mind!

BRIAN

I didn't say there was. Could I please --

Could I please -- May I respond?

SAMMY

No, that's really all I have to --

BRIAN

May I respond?

(Beat)

First of all, I don't appreciate

being spoken to with that kind of

language. That's not the way I talk

to you, and I'd appreciate it if you

wouldn't talk that way to me --

SAMMY

Well --

BRIAN

Second of all, if you say you didn't

change the colors on my computer

screen, then of course I accept your

answer. But you and I are gonna have

to find a way to work together --

SAMMY

Brian --

BRIAN

But that's not gonna happen with the

attitude, it's not gonna happen with

the lateness, it's not gonna happen

by fighting me every step of the way --

OK, well not you, you're not late,

but too much of that stuff goes on

around here --

SAMMY

I am not late and I do not have an

attitude -- Well then don't tell me

I'm late if I'm not late!

BRIAN

I'd really like to finish!

SAMMY

They were where?

PLUMBER

OK, you're all set.

BRIAN

This is Chuck. Chuck, this is my

wife, Nancy.

CHUCK

Hello.

NANCY

Nice to meet you.

BRIAN

This is Mabel...

MABEL

Hi.

NANCY

Nice to meet you.

BRIAN

This is Sammy, our lending officer.

Sammy, this is my wife, Nancy.

SAMMY

(Friendly)

Hi. It's nice to meet you.

NANCY

Brian -- I gotta sit down.

BRIAN

Sure -- Let's go in my office.

NANCY

I'm fine...!

SAMMY

Brian...?

BRIAN

Yeah.

RUDY (O.C.)

Mom!

SAMMY

Rudy!

SAMMY

Look, I'm glad you guys are getting

along so well -- like, you have no

idea -- but if I can't rely on you

to remember to get him once a day...

TERRY

You can!

SAMMY

-- And what are you doing taking him

to play pool in the middle of the

night, and then telling him to lie

to me about it?

TERRY

I don't know.

TERRY

Get out of the car.

RUDY

What are we doing?

TERRY

You're going to Carol's house and

I'm going home.

RUDY

Why can't I come with you?

TERRY

Because if you're such a baby you

gotta tell your Mommy about us playin'

pool when I totally asked you not

to, and I gotta listen to her shit

all day, then you're goin' to the

baby-sitter's so you can stay at the

baby house.

RUDY

But I didn't tell her!

TERRY

You know what? Don't even fuckin'

talk to me.

RUDY

I didn't!

TERRY

Just get out of the car.

BRIAN

You're working late.

SAMMY

How did your wife like the bank?

BRIAN

Oh, fine. She wasn't feeling so great.

SAMMY

That's too bad.

BRIAN

No -- I don't mean -- She's not ill.

She's just... I don't know...

SAMMY

Pregnant?

BRIAN

That's it. She's pregnant.

SAMMY

It can make you kind of cranky.

BRIAN

Yeah...

BRIAN

Listen, I'm sorry we've been stepping

on each other's toes -- I -- I'm not

actually that bad a guy --

SAMMY

Yeah, I am too... I know you're not,

Brian, but you're driving everybody

crazy.

BRIAN

Well, I -- I'm just trying to do my

best here -- And I'm gettin' it from

all sides.

SAMMY

I know you are...

BRIAN

Anyway... We'll work it out...

SAMMY

Well... I could use a beer.

BRIAN

I could use a tranquilizer.

SAMMY

Last I heard, Rudy's Dad was living

over in Auburn. But that was last

year.

BRIAN

Must be so tough raising a kid on

your own... Although I'm beginning

to get the idea my wife wouldn't

mind a crack at it.

SAMMY

Oh... It's just the hormones.

BRIAN

Well, no, it isn't. But never mind.

BRIAN

Well, here's to improved employee-

management relations.

SAMMY

Amen.

SAMMY

You can't judge all of Scottsville

by the people in that bank, believe

me.

BRIAN

Well -- Let's -- Let's not talk about

the bank.

SAMMY

OK.

BRIAN

Let's just forget about the bank for

tonight.

SAMMY

Good idea.

BRIAN

Sammy?

SAMMY

Yeah?

BRIAN

I want you to tell me who changed

the colors on my computer screen.

SAMMY

I'll never tell.

TERRY (O.C.)

Where were you?

SAMMY

Nowhere. I had dinner with my boss.

TERRY

Kind of a late dinner, ain't it?

SAMMY

Yeah. How was Rudy?

TERRY

Fine.

SAMMY

Did the plumber come?

TERRY

Yes, the fucking plumber came.

SAMMY

Terry -- Give me a break!!!

TERRY

What's the matter with you?

SAMMY

Nothing. I'm just tired.

TERRY

You want to smoke some pot?

SAMMY

No I don't. Why, you got some?

SAMMY

So... Bob asked me to marry him.

TERRY

Wow.

(Pause)

Are you going to?

SAMMY

I don't know. If he'd've asked me

this time last year I would have

probably said yes. But the minute he

said it, I don't know, I felt like

somebody was trying to strangle me.

TERRY

Well... bad sign.

SAMMY

I know.

(Pause)

Plus, Terry...

(Whispers)

I fucked my boss...!

TERRY

What?

SAMMY

I know! And his wife is six months

pregnant.

TERRY

Jesus Christ, Sammy...!

SAMMY

I know, I know.

SAMMY

Terry, I'm sorry I got so mad before.

I just don't want him, you know --

terrified of "telling," if there's --

TERRY

Uh, well, that's not really his

problem, Sammy.

SAMMY

Oh really? What's his problem?

TERRY

His problem is that he's like totally

sheltered because you treat him like

he's three, instead of eight, so

that's how he behaves.

SAMMY

Oh yeah? And how do you think he

should behave?

TERRY

I think he shouldn't have to run and

tell his Mommy every time he does

something she might not like, for

one thing.

SAMMY

Uh huh. And what do you --

TERRY

(On "and")

I mean I took him to play pool! It

was a little clandestine thing we

did for fun! It wasn't like a big

secret, I mean who cares? I was

actually trying to be nice to him.

But he's so freaked out that he

disobeyed your orders that he has to

fuckin' squeal on me and I have to

listen to your fuckin' shit all day

when I didn't even fuckin' do

anything!

SAMMY

First of all, he didn't tell me

anything: Darryl did. OK? Second of

all, I don't really give a shit if

you took him to play pool: I was mad

at you because you left him standing

at the bus stop in the rain. But no,

I don't want you telling him not to

squeal, because I don't want him put

in that position!

TERRY

(Losing ground)

Well... that... is a perfect example

of what I'm talking about.

SAMMY

You are in idiot.

TERRY

Darryl told you?

SAMMY

Yes!

SAMMY

Morning.

BRIAN

Yeah, good morning. Could you get

the door?

SAMMY

Listen -- I just --

SAMMY

Brian, that's enough.

BRIAN

OK. Sorry.

BOB

You're awfully quiet.

SAMMY

I'm sorry.

BOB

Um... Have you thought at all about

what I said?

SAMMY

Of course I've been thinking about

it.

BOB

So... Any decisions? Or -- do you

still want to think about it some

more...?

SAMMY

Well -- I mean -- I don't know, Bob.

I mean, we haven't exactly been going

steady the last few months, if you

know what I mean --

BOB

Yeah, no, I know --

SAMMY

-- and then we see each other twice

and you suddenly say you want to get

married? I mean...

BOB

No, you're right, you're right --

SAMMY

What are you talking about?

BOB

I don't know... I... Maybe this is...

Last year I sort of thought you were

possibly interested in that... idea...

but I was the one who, you know,

wasn't "ready" at that point -- So

that's why I thought things kind of

slowed down with us...

SAMMY

Don't make me feel bad for you.

BOB

(Bristling)

I don't want you to feel bad for me.

SAMMY

(Into phone)

Hello?

BRIAN

(On phone)

It's Brian.

SAMMY

Brian. Where are you?

BRIAN

I'm buying milk. I just thought I'd

say hello.

BRIAN

Look, I know it's probably too late,

but is there any way you can come

out for a little while?

SAMMY

Brian, I think you're going crazy.

BRIAN

I know I am. Can you meet me?

SAMMY

Um, OK.

SAMMY

Um -- I have to go out for a minute.

Do you want anything?

TERRY

Like what?

SAMMY

I don't know.

RUDY

Where are you going?

TERRY

Yeah, where are you going?

SAMMY

I just have to go out for a little

while.

RUDY

Where?

TERRY

Yeah, where?

SAMMY

I just have to go to Mabel's house.

RUDY

Why?

SAMMY

You know what, Rudy? It's personal.

This is a personal matter that has

to do with Mabel. I just have to go

see her for a little while.

TERRY

Listen. Listen. I'm sorry I said you

squealed on me. I was totally out of

line, and I really owe you an apology.

(Pause)

Did you hear what I said?

RUDY

(Staring at the TV)

I don't care.

RON

(Gently)

What's on your mind, Sammy?

SAMMY

Well, a lot. But principally... I

was just wondering if you had an

opinion. If you know someone, in

your family, or just someone you

really care about, and they just

can't seem to get ahold of

themselves...

TERRY

You know who this is for?

RUDY

Me!

TERRY

That's right, my little friend.

(To the saleslady)

Hello. We're going fishing.

RUDY

I got a new rod and reel, five lures,

I got a hat, I got a knife and I got

a fish scaler.

SAMMY

That's great, honey.

TERRY

I'll get it.

TERRY

Well... I'm not really sure why you're

here, Ron. I mean, I realize I haven't

exactly been a model citizen since I

got here, but compared to how things

have been goin' for me lately, I

thought I was doing pretty well.

TERRY

And I also find it kind of

discouraging that you seem to think

I need some kind of spiritual

counseling or what have you, so much

so that you're willing to disregard

the fact that I don't believe in any

of this stuff at all --

SAMMY

Well... I didn't mean to discourage

you --

TERRY

I mean it's really kind of insulting.

RON

Can I say something here?

(Pause)

Sammy asked me to come and talk to

you, because it's her opinion that

you're not gonna find what you're

looking for the way you're looking

for it --

TERRY

How would she know?

RON

But I'm really not here to try to

get you to do anything, or to believe

anything. And I'll tell you the same

thing I told her, which is that as

far as I'm concerned the only way

she can help you is by her example --

by trying to be a model for you, by

the way she lives her life...

RON

And that doesn't mean she's supposed

to be a saint, either, if that's

what you're smiling about.

TERRY

I didn't realize I was smiling.

RON

You know, Terry, a lot of people

come to see me with all kinds of

problems. Drugs, alcohol, marital

problems, sexual problems, health

problems --

TERRY

Great job you got.

RON

Well... I like it. Because even in

this little town, I feel like what I

do is very connected with the real

center of people's lives. I'm not

saying I'm always Mr. Effective, but

I don't feel like my life is off to

the side of what's important. You

know? I don't feel my happiness and

comfort are based on closing my eyes

to trouble within myself or trouble

in other people. I don't feel like a

negligible little scrap, floating

around in some kind of empty void,

with no sense of connectedness to

anything around me except by virtue

of whatever little philosophies I

can scrape together on my own...

TERRY

Well --

RON

Can I ask you, Terry: Do you think

your life is important?

TERRY

You mean -- Like, me personally, my

individual life?

RON

Yeah.

TERRY

Well... I'm not sure -- What do you

mean? It's important to me. I guess.

And like, to my, you know, the people

who care about me...

RON

But do you think it's important?

TERRY

I --

RON

Do you think it's important in the

scheme of things? Not just because

it's yours, or because you're

somebody's brother. Because I don't

really get the impression that you

do.

TERRY

Well, I don't think... I don't

particularly think anybody's life

has any particular importance besides

whatever -- you know -- whatever we

arbitrarily give it. Which is fine.

I mean we might as well... I think

I'm as important as anybody else...

TERRY

I don't know: A lot of what you're

saying has a real appeal to me, Ron.

A lot of the stuff they told us when

we were kids... But I don't want to

believe something or not believe it

because I might feel bad. I want to

believe it because I think it's true

or not... I'd like to think that my

life is important... Or that it's

connected to something important...

RON

Well, isn't there any way for you to

believe that without calling it God,

or religion, or whatever term it is

you object to?

TERRY

Yes. I believe that.

TERRY

So Sammy, what example will you be

setting for us tonight?

RUDY

What time are we getting up to go

fishing?

TERRY

We're not going fishing.

SAMMY

What do you mean?

RUDY

Why not?

TERRY

I think you should go fishing with

Father Ron.

RUDY

I don't want to go fishing with Father

Ron.

TERRY

Well, I'm not takin' you.

SAMMY

I'll take you, sweetie.

SAMMY

I realize that you're mad at me --

TERRY

(Deadpan)

I'm not mad at you...

SAMMY

-- but he didn't do anything to you.

And you cannot promise a little boy

that you're gonna --

TERRY

(On "boy")

...I just, you know, after all that

religious conversation, I just

realized it's probably not so good

for him to be spending so much time

with someone like me who doesn't

believe his life is important in the

scheme of things --

SAMMY

Would you please...

TERRY

I'm serious.

SAMMY

(Practically choking)

Listen.

(Pause)

I am sure, if you put your mind to

it, you can think of some other way

of getting back at me besides this.

So would you please just give it

some thought, and take him fishing

tomorrow?

TERRY

I would, Sammy, I just don't think

it'd be good for him.

SAMMY

You suck.

NANCY

(Into the phone)

Hello?

BOB

(Into the phone)

Hello?

SAMMY

Anyway... I don't know what the

church's position is on adultery and

fornication these days, but I felt

really hypocritical not saying

anything to you about it before,

so... What is the official position

on that stuff these days?

RON

Well... it's a sin.

SAMMY

Good: I think it should be.

RON

...but we don't tend to focus on

that aspect of it, right off the bat --

SAMMY

Why not?

RON

Well --

SAMMY

I think you should.

RON

Well --

SAMMY

Maybe it was better when you came in

and they screamed at you for having

sex with your married boss, and were

really mean to you, and told you

what a terrible thing it was. Maybe

it'd be better if you told me how

I'm endangering my immortal soul,

and if I don't quit I'm going to

burn in hell. Don't you ever think

that?

RON

Um... No.

SAMMY

Well, it's a lot better than all

this "Why do you think you're in

this situation" psychological bullshit

you hear all the time.

RON

Well... Why do you think you're in

this situation?

SAMMY

With which one?

RON

All of them.

SAMMY

I feel sorry for them.

(Pause)

Isn't that ridiculous?

RUDY

I've never been so bored in my life.

TERRY

Yeah... We really shoulda been out

here around seven or eight A.M.

RUDY

What time is it now?

TERRY

Two-thirty.

RUDY

Was my father a good fisherman?

TERRY

Yeah, your father was good at all

that stuff. He knew everything about

the woods, everything about fishing,

everything about hunting and

everything about cars. If he wasn't

such a pain in the ass he would've

been a lot of fun to be around.

RUDY

Maybe he's nicer now.

TERRY

I doubt it.

RUDY

Well, I think he is.

TERRY

How would you know? Did you ever

meet him?

RUDY

No.

TERRY

Were you ever curious to meet him?

RUDY

I guess so.

TERRY

Well, he doesn't live very far from

here.

RUDY

I thought he lived in Alaska.

TERRY

No -- I lived in Alaska. Your dad

lives in Auburn. Far as I know.

(Pause)

We could look him up in the phone

book. Wanna try?

RUDY

All right.

TERRY

OK -- But -- I'm sure I don't have

to say this, but I'm not kidding,

man: Don't -- tell -- your -- mother.

BOB

Do you want to go for a walk, or a

drive? It's really nice out.

SAMMY

No. I'm not gonna stay long. Bob, I

don't want to get married.

BOB

OK.

SAMMY

I've really thought about it a lot,

and if you had asked me last year

I'm sure I would have said yes.

BOB

Oh. Thank you.

SAMMY

But I'm not sure it would have been

a good idea then either. I'm going

through a really hard time right now

and I just think that getting engaged

to you or anyone would be just about

the stupidest most self-destructive

thing I could possibly do.

BOB

OK.

SAMMY

And I really think you have to grow

up.

BOB

Well, how about we fix up my

personality some other time?

SAMMY

OK.

(Pause)

I really hope we can still be friends.

BOB

(Quietly sarcastic)

Oh, yes, me too.

SAMMY

Bob... This is so crazy... I mean...

I don't even understand why you... I

don't even get it.

BOB

What do you want me to say? Everything

you said about me was true, Sammy. I

was just a big chickenshit jerk, and

now I'm payin' the price.

SAMMY

Bob...!

BOB

What?

SAMMY

Well -- I don't know...

BOB

I don't know. Sammy, I love you. I

wish I could say it in a more

interesting way. I just -- I love

you.

SAMMY

Well -- I mean -- I love you too --

SAMMY

Oh shit.

BOB

What's the matter?

SAMMY

I gotta go. I'm sorry --

BOB

Where do you have to go?

SAMMY

(Off the top of her

head)

I'm supposed to -- I gotta get Mabel

back her car.

BOB

Well... I don't understand. How are

we leaving things?

SAMMY

Oh God, I don't know. Call me later.

SAMMY

Sorry I'm so late.

BRIAN

Yeah, I was just about to give up on

you.

SAMMY

Well -- maybe it would've been better

if you had...

SAMMY

I mean -- Look, I don't mean to be

unsympathetic about your domestic

situation, whatever it is, but I'm

just beginning to think that if people

tried a little harder to stick to

their commitments and started taking

a little responsibility for their

actions, they might end up having a

lot less trouble generally. That's

all.

BRIAN

Hey, that's what I've been trying to

tell you guys at the bank.

SAMMY

Well, I really don't think I can do

this anymore.

BRIAN

OK.

SAMMY

This is incredible.

BRIAN

Mmmm.

SAMMY

That is not what I mean.

RUDY

Maybe we should call first.

TERRY

Well -- We're right here.

TERRY

Come on.

TERRY

There he is.

RUDY

His last name is Kolinski?

TERRY

Yeah. Ring the bell.

JANIE

Yes?

TERRY

Hi. We're looking for Rudy?

JANIE

Who should I say is calling?

TERRY

An old friend.

RUDY SR. (O.C.)

Who is it?

JANIE

He says an old friend!

RUDY SR. (O.C.)

How old is he?

RUDY SR.

Hey!

TERRY

Hey, Rudy.

RUDY SR.

Hey.

TERRY

(To JANIE)

Hi, I'm Terry.

JANIE

Hello.

TERRY

And this is Rudy.

JANIE

You don't say.

TERRY

Rudy, meet Rudy.

JANIE

I'll just be in the kitchen.

TERRY

Nice to meet you.

TERRY

OK if we come in for a minute?

RUDY SR.

What the hell are you doin'?

TERRY

What do you mean what am I doin' --

RUDY SR.

Could you step away from the door

please?

TERRY

Well we just wanna --

RUDY SR.

Could you step away from the door

please?

TERRY

All right, all right.

RUDY SR.

What are you doin' here?

TERRY

I just wanted the kid to see you --

RUDY SR.

Well, now he saw me.

(He looks at Rudy)

Now you saw me. OK?

(To Terry)

Now would you mind?

TERRY

Man, you are really --

RUDY SR.

Look: I'm tryin' to be polite. So

would you just take off? It's OK:

Just take off.

TERRY

I just wanna --

RUDY SR.

Do you know what you're doin'? Just

get outta here!

TERRY

You know what, man? You're still a

fuckin' asshole.

RUDY SR.

I'm an asshole? Get outta here!

JANIE

Get your fuckin' hands off him...!

CUT TO:

1ST COP

And you're not the boy's legal

guardian?

RUDY SR.

I don't even know if that's my kid!

JANIE

They just showed up! We never seen

them before...

RUDY SR.

I used to know his sister --

TERRY

I just came down here to talk to the

guy and all of a sudden he starts

shovin' me!

2ND COP

Listen up. Listen up. You're gonna

have to step back and just calm down --

TERRY

(To RUDY SR.)

You're a lyin' fuckin' piece of shit.

2ND COP

(To TERRY)

You're gonna have to step back.

JANIE

We have a right to protect ourselves.

What else do you need to know?

2ND COP

Now give me your right hand...

TERRY

This is such bullshit. He started

the whole thing and you're arresting

me?

2ND COP

Listen up. Now -- Listen up! Stop

talkin'. Terry, stop talkin'.

CUT TO:

2ND COP

-- idea where we might be able to

contact his mother?

RUDY SR.

No, because he's not my Goddamn kid.

SAMMY

What time is it?

BRIAN

(Startled awake)

What's the matter?

SAMMY

Oh my gosh.

BRIAN

Hey, you know, Nancy's gonna be gone

for the rest of the week...

SAMMY

You know... Brian...

BRIAN

Yeah?

SAMMY

Well, I don't want to... I mean,

couldn't we just... I mean, could we

give it a rest?

BRIAN

Um -- Yeah. Sure. If you want to.

SAMMY

I mean... I just think... I don't

know: We had a great little fling.

You know? Let's not push it.

(Pause)

I mean, is that OK? I just --

BRIAN

Yeah. Sure. OK. You're right.

SAMMY

So are we still friends?

BRIAN

(Nods tersely)

Mm hm. Sure.

SAMMY

All right. Good...!

SAMMY

Around two o'clock this afternoon...

Yeah, a ninety three Toyota Tercel.

New York plates V127AC... Please.

SAMMY

Thanks for coming over. I just want

to have a car handy just in case.

BOB

No problem.

SAMMY

(Into the phone)

Well -- what about other towns?...

Yes! Yes! I called the highway patrol

four times... Well what am I supposed

to do all night?

SAMMY

(Into phone)

Hello?

BRIAN

Anyone hear from Sammy this morning?

MABEL

I didn't.

BRIAN

Uh huh. Well, if anyone ever hears

from her ever again, will you let me

know?

MABEL

Yes.

SHERIFF

It's gonna be all right... We got on

the phone and talked to Rudy Sr. a

little bit and he's calmed down,

just wants to forget about the whole

thing...

SAMMY

Darryl, I really appreciate this...

SAMMY

Hello?

BRIAN

Yeah, it's Brian.

SAMMY

Brian --

BRIAN

What the hell happened to you today,

lady?

SAMMY

Hello?

BRIAN

You're fired!

SAMMY

GOOD!

SAMMY

Rudy?

RUDY

Yeah?

SAMMY

Is there anything you want to ask

me, about your father?

RUDY

Oh, that wasn't my father.

SAMMY

What?

RUDY

That wasn't him. I heard him tell

the cops.

SAMMY

No -- Rudy -- that was him. But that

was him. I wish it wasn't, but it

was.

RUDY

(Very quiet)

No it wasn't.

SAMMY

Rudy. Yes it was. Your father's name

is Rudy Kolinski. He lives in

Auburn...

SAMMY

Could you turn that off for a minute

please?

TERRY

You don't have to say anything, Sammy.

SAMMY

I want you to leave.

TERRY

What do you mean?

SAMMY

I mean I don't think you should live

here anymore. I don't think you know

how to behave around an eight-year-

old and I don't know how to make you

stop, so I think you shouldn't live

here. I don't know what else to say.

TERRY

I don't know how to behave around an

eight-year-old?

SAMMY

That's right --

TERRY

I think you don't know how to behave

around an eight-year-old.

SAMMY

Are you out of your MIND!?!

SAMMY

Now you just listen to me. I may not

be the greatest mother in the world,

but I'm doing the best I know how.

And he doesn't need you to rub his

face in shit because you think it's

good for him. He's going to find out

the world is a horrible place and

that people suck soon enough, and

without any help from you. Believe

me!

SAMMY

I think you should get your own place.

I thought, if you want, you could --

I'll be glad to help you out

financially --

TERRY

What do you mean, Get my own place?

SAMMY

I mean I --

TERRY

You mean in Scottsville?

SAMMY

Yes.

TERRY

Why would I do that? Why don't I

just leave, period?

SAMMY

(Quietly)

Well... If that's what you want to

do, that's fine. But that's not what

I'm saying. You are a very important

person to Rudy, and you are the most

important person to me. But I'm saying

that I can't take any more of this --

TERRY

Well --

SAMMY

-- I thought -- maybe you could sell

your half of the house to me, and I

could pay you whatever it is over a

certain amount of time, and that way --

TERRY

No, you know what? I'll just go.

SAMMY

(Very quietly)

Well -- that's not what I'm saying.

RUDY

Where are you going?

TERRY

I don't know. I just want to get out

of this town. And if you've got any

sense when you get old enough you'll

get out of here too. Your Mom's gonna

live in this town for the rest of

her life, and you know why? Because

she thinks she has to. Don't ask me

why, but that's the truth. She thinks

there's all these things she has to

do, but you want to know one thing

about your Mom? She's a bigger fuck-

up than I ever was. I mean, I know I

messed up. You think I enjoy getting

thrown in jail because I wanted you

to face that prick your Dad like a

little man and see what kind of a

guy he is? I know I got a little

carried away, and I lost my temper

just a little bit -- which is not

the end of the world either, by the

way, just for future reference --And

now she's kickin' me out of my own

house because -- you know, because I

fucked up a little bit. Which I

totally admit. I was like -- totally

ready to admit that.

RUDY

I could go with you.

TERRY

Well, thanks, man. But I, uh, I can't

really take care of you.

SAMMY

Is that for you?

TERRY

Yeah, I'm just gonna stay at Ray's

till I take off.

SAMMY

You don't have to do that.

TERRY

Yeah. Well, that's what I wanna do,

so --

SAMMY

Well but -- Are you gonna come back

to say good-bye?

TERRY

No -- I'm just gonna take off. I'll

see you later.

SAMMY

Well --

SAMMY

Look. I know you're upset about Uncle

Terry leaving, and so am I. But he's

just not in control of himself, and

I don't want him hurting your feelings

anymore -- or mine. And you may not

like it, but that's how it's gotta

be. OK?

RUDY

I don't care.

SAMMY

You don't care. I don't care either.

BRIAN

Well... I'm sorry you're havin' all

this trouble...

SAMMY

Thank you.

BRIAN

But you made a pretty good speech to

me yesterday about people sticking

to their commitments...

SAMMY

Yeah...?

BRIAN

Well... you made a commitment to

this bank, Sammy. To this job.

SAMMY

I know I'd --

BRIAN

And to working things out with this

tough new son of a bitch boss of

yours. And whatever might have passed

between us after hours doesn't mean

you just walk away from that

commitment -- yeah, even when you

have a legitimate family emergency.

SAMMY

I'm really sorry I didn't --

BRIAN

Which is why I think in the calm

cold light of day, we should both

think real hard about whether or not

you really want to continue on here

at Merchants National Trust.

SAMMY

You're not serious.

BRIAN

...you're not happy, I'm not happy,

it's not good for you and it sure as

heck isn't good for the bank.

SAMMY

You know you're the worst manager

we've ever had?

BRIAN

Come on, Sammy...

SAMMY

By far the worst.

BRIAN

...I don't wanna trade insults with

you.

SAMMY

Well, I don't want to be fired, Brian.

I've been working here for seven

years.

BRIAN

Well --

SAMMY

And if I were you I'd be a little

nervous about firing an employee I

just had an affair with. OK?

BRIAN

That's -- Don't threaten me, Sammy:

I'm not threatening you. I -- It's

just an area I think we should

explore.

SAMMY

I'm not thr -- You explore it. I'm

going back to work.

SAMMY

Oh, and I have to pick up Rudy today

because there's no one else to do

it. But I'll find someone as soon as

I have time.

BRIAN

Yeah. Fine. Why don't you just take

over the whole bank?

SAMMY

Well, I called where Uncle Terry

said he was gonna stay, and there

was no answer, so I don't know if

he's still in town or not.

SAMMY

Rudy? Are you not speaking to me?

SAMMY

Well, I'm sorry you're so mad at me,

but I only did what I thought I had

to do, and I hope you don't stay mad

at me for the rest of your life.

SAMMY

Rudy, that's too much.

SAMMY

You gotta cut this out!

RUDY

What did I do?

SAMMY

You don't know what you're talking

about! There was nothing else I could

do! I can't explain it better than

that, but you can't go on like this

because you don't know anything about

it and you don't know what you're

doing!

RUDY

(Frightened)

OK, I'm sorry!

SAMMY

I don't want you to be sorry, I just

want you to STOP IT!

RUDY

I will! I will! I'm stopping, I'm

sorry.

RUDY

See? I'm stopping! I'm not doing it.

See? I'm not.

TERRY

(Into phone)

Ray's house.

SAMMY

Hi.

SAMMY

I didn't know if you left yet.

TERRY

No -- I'm leavin' tomorrow.

SAMMY

Well -- What time?

TERRY

There's a bus at nine.

SAMMY

Well -- Can I -- I'd like to see you

before you go. I mean, can I give

you a lift? Or do you want to have

breakfast or anything? And I think

Rudy would really like to say good-

bye.

TERRY

Yeah -- I don't know... I mean --

SAMMY

Terry, you can't just leave like

this. I --

TERRY

All right, all right. I'll come by

in the morning.

SAMMY

All right -- But just -- We have to

be out of the house by eight, so --

I don't want to tell Rudy you're

coming unless you really think you

can make it --

TERRY

Yeah -- No -- I'll be there.

SAMMY

All right.

TERRY

All right.

SAMMY

You should get your sneakers on.

SAMMY

Sweetie, I'm sorry, we have to go.

RUDY

Why can't I miss school one day?

RUDY

Hi!

TERRY

Hey, how's it goin', man?

TERRY

Sorry I'm late.

TERRY

So Rudy... If I write you a letter,

will you write me back?

RUDY

Yeah.

TERRY

OK, well, that's gonna be pretty

nice for you, because I write a pretty

Goddamn interesting letter.

RUDY

Yeah, we'll see.

TERRY

All right. Well, say good-bye.

RUDY

Bye.

SAMMY

Do you need some cash for the bus?

TERRY

No, I got a few bucks... Aren't you

gonna be late for work?

SAMMY

Oh -- Yeah. That's OK.

(Pause)

Terry, I don't even know where you're

going.

TERRY

Oh, well, I didn't really have a

concrete plan yet. I have to go back

to Worcester and get my stuff...

SAMMY

Oh, are you gonna try to see that

girl?

TERRY

Well... Yeah... You know... Thought

maybe I'd try to show my face... Let

her brother have a crack at me...

SAMMY

What?

TERRY

No...

SAMMY

...I don't want anyone to have a

crack at you.

TERRY

I'm just kidding. I just thought...

Just thought I'd check up on her...

(Pause)

Anyway, after that, I don't really

know. I've been thinking about Alaska

a lot. I still got some friends out

there. I don't really know. Anyway,

I'll write you.

SAMMY

You will?

TERRY

Sure, Sammy. Of course I will. You

know that.

SAMMY

What is gonna happen to you?

TERRY

Nothing too bad... But I gotta tell

you, I know things didn't work out

too well this time...

SAMMY

Well, Terry --

TERRY

...but it's always really good to

know that wherever I am, whatever

stupid shit I'm doing, you're back

at my home, rooting for me.

SAMMY

I do root for you.

TERRY

Come on, Sammy. Everything's gonna

be all right... Comparatively... And

I'll be back this way...

SAMMY

I feel like I'm never gonna see you

again...!

TERRY

Of course you will, Sammy. You never

have to worry about that.

SAMMY

Please don't go till you know where

you're going. Please...!

TERRY

I do know where I'm going. I'm going

to Worcester and I'm gonna try to

see that girl. And then depending on

what happens there, I thought I'd

try to see if there's any work for

me out West. And if there is, I'm

gonna head out there for the summer

and try to make some money. And if

there isn't, I'll figure something

else out. Maybe I'll stay around the

East. I don't know... I really liked

it in Alaska. It was really beautiful.

You just -- It made me feel good.

And before things got so messed up I

was doin' pretty well out there.

Seriously. But I couldn't stay here

long, Sammy: I don't want to live

here. But I'm gonna stay in touch.

And I'll be back. 'Cause I want to

see you and I want to see Rudy. I'll

come home for Christmas. How about

that? We'll have Christmas together.

(Pause)

Come on, Sammy. You can trust me...

TERRY

Come on, Sammy... Look at me... Look

at me...

TERRY

Hey, Sammy... Remember when we were

kids, remember what we always used

to say to each other . . .?

(Pause)

Remember when we were kids?

SAMMY

Of course I do...!

THE END
