KILLING ZOE

Written by

Roger Avary

ZED

Hotel Mondial.

CAB DRIVER

Le Mondial.  Tres bien.

CAB DRIVER

Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un

moment.  L'autoroute est ferme.  A cause

du 14 Juillet.

CAB DRIVER

[Do you mind the radio?]

CAB DRIVER

[Do you want me to turn the radio off?]

ZED

(realizing he's being asked a

question)

I don't speak French.

CAB DRIVER

(in broken English)

Ah.  American?

ZED

That's right.

CAB DRIVER

That's good because I speak a little

English.

CAB DRIVER

I asked if you mind the radio.  Music.

You know.

CAB DRIVER

(with a smile)

Super cool.

ZED

What time is it?

CAB DRIVER

Time, time, time.  I don't know.

Daytime.

CAB DRIVER

Are you in town for business?

ZED

Yes.

CAB DRIVER

It's a nice hotel.  Your hotel.  Very big

rooms.

CAB DRIVER

Do you know Paris?

ZED

I've been here once before.  When I was

younger.

CAB DRIVER

Those were the days.

CAB DRIVER

Married?

ZED

I beg your pardon?

CAB DRIVER

Do you have a wife?

ZED

No.

(then after thinking about it

for a while)

Why?

CAB DRIVER

Well, if you need a wife for the night...

(searching for the right words

in French)

Une escorte.  Pour vous faire visiter.

(then back to his broken

English)

For business.  I give you my number.

Very nice girl.  French.  Like when you

were young.

CAB DRIVER

Know what I mean?

CAB DRIVER

Speaks the language of love.  Take you to

heaven and back.  You just tell me and I

set it up.

CAB DRIVER

What you laughing at?  You let Moises set

it up.  She treat you right.  She treat

you fine.

DISSOLVE TO:

BELLBOY

(in broken English)

Your package...It arrived in the last

night of before last night.

BELLBOY

Ah...telephone, for the room service.

BELLBOY

The toilet.

BELLBOY

To hang the clothes.

BELLBOY

From here you can operate the television.

BELLBOY

(after getting what he wanted)

Merci.

ZED

Oh, wait.

ZED

What time is it?

BELLBOY

(confused)

What time is it?

ZED

(pointing at his watch)

Time.

BELLBOY

Ah.  Yes.  Il est presque huit heures

moins dix.

FADE TO BLACK:

ZOEY

Bonjour.

ZED

(a little awkwardly)

Bonjour.

ZOEY

Wow.  Vous avez une belle chambre.  Je ne

suis jamais venue dans cet hotel.

ZOEY

Ca sera 150 francs de l'heure.  Toute la

nuit pour 700.  D'avance.  Et faudra

porter un--

ZED

I...don't speak French.

ZOEY

It's okay.

ZOEY

It will be one thousand francs for all

night.  In advance.

ZOEY

We can do it now if you want.

ZED

Well, let me just dry up.

ZOEY

Okay, but it's not necessary.

ZED(O.S.)

(from the bathroom)

What's your name?

ZOEY

Zoe or Zoey.  Which ever you like.

ZED(O.S.)

My name's Zed.

ZOEY

(smiling at this)

That's funny.  We both have Z names.

ZED

What was that?

ZOEY

You can take those off.  The pants.

ZED

I'd rather watch you get undressed first.

ZOEY

(matter-of-factly)

Alright.

ZED

Slower.

ZOEY

Alright Mister America.  Zed.

ZOEY

Slow enough for you?

ZOEY

C'etait formidable.

ZOEY

I'm cold.

ZOEY

Zed?

ZED

Yes?

ZOEY

Moises told me you were in town for

business.

ZED

Yes.

ZOEY

What kind of business?

ZED

Why?

ZOEY

I don't know.  I'm just curious.

ZED

Do you ask all your clients questions?

ZOEY

No.  Just the ones I like.

ZED

So you like me?

ZOEY

Yes.

ZED

Why?

ZOEY

Because you're...a good person.  I run

into some real creeps.  You know.

ZED

How do you know I'm a good person?

ZOEY

Body language.  We fit together.

ZED

All men and women fit together.  Hell,

even some men fit together.

ZOEY

No, but you know, we clicked.  You made

me orgasm.  Do you know how often I

orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with?

ZED

No I don't.

ZOEY

Usually never.  They're almost always fat

like pigs.

ZOEY

And you make me feel safe.  That's

something more important than the orgasm.

An integral part maybe of the orgasm.

ZED

I never really thought of it like that.

ZOEY

Well, it's true.

ZOEY

Turn off the television.

ZOEY

So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like

you very much.

ZED

Well, I like you too Zoe.

ZOEY

Honest?

ZOEY

Why?  For the same reason?  Any man can

orgasm.  Even with his own hand.

ZED

Well, I like your honesty.  You're open.

Unlike most prostitutes I've been with.

ZOEY

I am not a prostitute!

ZED

Really?  Can I have my francs back then?

ZOEY

I'm a student.  And to pay for the

classes I became an escort.  It's my

choice to sleep with you.

ZED

I see.

ZOEY

What?  You don't understand.

ZED

No, I do.

ZOEY

Hey, it's not easy.

ZED

I didn't say it was.

ZOEY

I'm here because I want to.

ZED

Okay, okay relax.  What school do you go

to?

ZOEY

The Centre du Art, Paris.

ZED

That's really interesting.  What kind of

art do you study?

ZOEY

Not any of the old shit.

ZED

Oh.

ZOEY

I have a day job too.  Three times a

week.

ZOEY

But someday there will be only my art.

ZED

What kind of things do you paint?

ZOEY

I don't paint.  I make things.  Objects.

Not like sculpture.  Like life...but with

no narrative.  I want when someone looks

at one of my objects for there to be no

reference to the world.  Void of feeling,

emotion...void of destiny.  Those are

left for me.  They belong only to me.  If

someone else can see into it...then it is

no longer mine.  I have failed.  And I

would destroy it.  I don't care how much

cash they would offer me.  It would be

shit.  I can't tell you how many objects

of mine have been destroyed.  They told

too much about me.  And if someone wants

to know something about me...I'll tell

them myself.  The way I'm telling you.

ZOEY

What I do I do only for the objects.

ZED

I'd like to see one of these.

ZOEY

What?  So you could see the work of a

whore?

ZED

Zoey.  I'm sorry for calling you a

prostitute.  I didn't understand the

difference.

ZOEY

The difference is a prostitute would have

lied to you about her orgasm.

ZED

If these things you make are as true as

you are...I'm sure they're as

indescribable.  Perhaps, someday, you'll

make one...about me.

ZOEY

If I do...you'll never know which one it

is.  Because I'll be the only one who

understands.  I'll be the only one who

can look into it and see where in my life

it came from.

DISSOLVE TO:

ZOEY

(groggily)

What time is it?

ZED

I have no idea.  Night time.

ZOEY

I'm going to take a shower.

ERIC

(with a thick accent)

Hey you madman!

ZED

Eric.  Come in.

ERIC

What happened to you?  I thought you were

going to call.

ERIC

(smiling)

Oh I see.  You have been busy.

ZED

Sorry, I asked the hotel to give me a

wake up call.

ERIC

That's good, but now I am here.  So let's

go.  We have a lot to talk about.

ZED

What about the girl?

ERIC

Is she your girlfriend?

ZED

No.

ERIC

Fuck her.

ERIC

She's a dishrag whore.  Kick her out.

ZED

I'll let her stay here tonight.

ERIC

Don't be silly.  It's dangerous.

ERIC

(in French with English

subtitles)

[Okay.  Get out of the shower.  It's time

for you to leave.]

ZOEY

[Fuck you.]

ERIC

[No.  Come on you fucking slut!]

ZOEY

[Let go of me you shit!!]

ZED

Eric.

ERIC

(to Zed)

Don't worry about her.

(to Zoey in French)

[Why don't you just go back to your pimp

and suck his black dick!]

ERIC

God damn it!

ERIC

[Get the fuck out of here you fucking

whore!]

ZOEY

[Give me my clothes you asshole!]

ERIC

(looking at his hand wound)

God damn it.  Look at my hand.

ZED

(shocked at the whole incident)

Jesus Eric.

ZOEY(O.S.)

Ouvres!  Je veux mes habits!

ERIC

Oh shit.  Her clothes.

ZOEY

(almost too quick to

understand)

Tu te prends pour qui espece de connard!?

ERIC

La ferme!

ERIC

So tell me, what have you been up to?

ZOEY(O.S.)

Allez vous faire enculer tous le deux!

ZED

Eric, I liked that girl.

ERIC

Oh.  Well, then why didn't you stop me.

ZED

Because you were on a rampage.

ERIC

Look, your whole life you've done nothing

but fuck whores.  A girl like that will

give you AIDS.  Why don't you find a nice

girl in the suburbs?

ZED

Because when you need to get off you

don't want to have to date for months to

do it.

ERIC

Just use your hand like me.

ZED

Sometimes you just need honesty...and

security.

ERIC

I don't understand.  Anyway, it's too

late.  Get dressed, let's go out and meet

the boys.

ZED

Okay, let me take a shower.

ERIC

No, in Paris it's good to smell like

you've been fucking.  It will make them

respect you.

ZED

Oh.

ERIC

Just put on a shirt and a sport coat.

ERIC

I'm glad you came.  How long has it been?

ZED

Years.

ERIC

It's amazing, you know?  Here you are.

One day in America.  Now here.

ZED

Well, to be honest there really wasn't

much happening for me in the states.

ERIC

But in Paris your old friend Eric has a

job for you, so you came.  That's good.

ZED

How could I resist your invitation?

ERIC

You would have been stupid to.

ZED

So what have you been doing here?

ERIC

After school I spent some time in Algeria

studying African philosophy.  And then I

bummed around.  You know.  For fun.  For

a while I worked at Le Figaro.  The

newspaper.

ZED

Really?

ERIC

Yes.  With an assumed Masters degree.

And lately we have just been bombing

fascists here in Paris.  You know, like

terrorists.

ERIC

It's fun.

CUT TO:

ERIC

The people next door are on holiday.  We

took their phone.  If you want to make a

long distance call, go ahead.

ZED

Is that cat dead?

ERIC

I don't know.  I think it's asleep but

it's been there for days.

ERIC

I guess it is dead.

ERIC

Hello.

ERIC

(to Zed)

Okay.  This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean,

Oliver, and Claude.  Got it?

ZED

I will.

ERIC

They all know who you are.

(to the rest of them)

Ne soyez pa salauds.  Offrez une biere au

plus grand perceur de coffres.

OLIVER

(with an English accent)

Zed, would you like a beer?

ZED

Thanks.

OLIVER

Don't think of it.

CLAUDE

(to Zed)

Come.  Sit down.

CLAUDE

(to Zed)

Easy.  Don't scare him.  He just wants to

claim you.

CLAUDE

Let me introduce you properly.  This is

Enrique.

CLAUDE

He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we

don't always get what we like...do we?

CLAUDE

(to Enrique)

Tais-toi!

(then to Zed)

Do you like hash?

ERIC

(jokingly)

Don't sit next to that junkie.

CLAUDE

Ahhhhhh!

ERIC

(to Claude)

That little shit monkey of yours pissed

on my Billy Holiday albums.  Next time

he's out the door.

(to Zed)

Zed, come here.

OLIVER

Here you go mate.

ZED

Thanks.

ERIC

Don't ask me where we got this.

ZED

Okay.

ERIC

On Bastille Day, all the banks are

closed.

ERIC

But this one.  BIP.  The Banque

Internationale de Paris.  And for being

greedy capitalists perhaps they will

remain closed next Bastille day.  Yes?

ERIC

We will go in and shut the bank down.

Now, look at this.

ERIC

As you can see, only one person can start

the alarm.

(he hands it to Zed)

The concierge, at this desk.

(he points it out on the

blueprint)

We will take care of him.  Then we can

close the bank.  No one will know the

difference since every other bank will be

closed.

ZED

(turning the schematic around)

Are you sure he won't push the alarm?

ERIC

Ahhh!  He's right next to the door.  We'd

have to be totally incompetent not to

stop him.  Don't worry about that.

ERIC

Here.  This is where they keep the days

reserve cash.  Okay fuck that.

ERIC

There are many vaults downstairs, but

this is the vault we must get into.  This

is where the real prize is.

ZED

What kind of vault is that?

ERIC

Ah...Swiss made.  A Caliber.

ZED

Caliber?

(he thinks about it)

It'll take three hours.

ERIC

No, that's too long.

ZED

That's how long it'll take.

ERIC

Well shit.  It's too long.  We have to be

in and out.

(he snaps his fingers)

Like that.  Or there will be suspicion.

A little time is okay...but too long

and...

ZED

Well hold on a second.

(pointing to the blueprint)

What's this?

ERIC

Another vault.

ZED

No this.

ERIC

I don't know...it connects the two

vaults.

ZED

Well, what kind of vault is this other

one?

ERIC

(reading the blueprint)

Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.

ZED

Why would those two vaults be connected?

ERIC

I don't know.

ZED

Because I can get into this vault in half

an hour.  Maybe less.

ERIC

But this entry way is too small to get

the platen out.  We have a lot of

merchandise in there.

ZED

No, don't you see?  We get in through

this secondary vault and take this

passage to the other main vault.  From

the inside I could open the Caliber vault

in five minutes.

ERIC

You could open it in five minutes?

ZED

From the inside it's easy.

ERIC

(excited)

Hot damn.  That is our answer.

ZED

Okay.  When is Bastille day?

ERIC

Tomorrow.

ZED

Tomorrow!?  We're doing this tomorrow?

ERIC

But of course.

ZED

It's impossible.

ERIC

It's not impossible.  Everyone knows what

to do.

ZED

I don't know what to do.

ERIC

You don't need to know shit.  Just get

into the vault and we'll do the rest.

ZED

I haven't even seen the bank.

ERIC

Fuck the bank.  Before we do a job we

live life.  It's better that way.  Okay?

ZED

(unsure)

Okay.

ERIC

Good.  Now we do heroin!

CUT TO:

OLIVER

(so high he's wobbling)

You have to look at the Starship

Enterprise as a metaphor for the human

brain.

OLIVER

(continuing)

Spock is the right hemisphere of the

brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is

the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional.

And Kirk is the unseen observer.  He

drifts between the two.  Back and forth,

as it might be, caught between the two

thought processes.

ERIC

[Cotton.]

OLIVER

(continuing)

It's really quite brilliant you know.

That's why Star Trek is and always will

be a hit show.

ERIC

(to Oliver)

[Here, shut up and hold this.]

ERIC

[Don't want to get air bubbles in my

veins.]

JEAN

Do you want heroin?

ZED

No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.

JEAN

No.  A little bit of heroin, some hash, a

beer...and you're just right.

CLAUDE

Okay.

JEAN

(recovering from the snort)

That's good.

ERIC

(to Ricardo in French)

[Hold my arm.]

(then to Zed)

My vein is like a rock.

JEAN

(to Zed)

Try some.  It's called chasing the

dragon.  The Chinese have been doing it

for centuries.

ZED

I don't think so.

JEAN

Oh, but you must.  It will make you feel

as though the rest of the world is in a

bubble of glass and that you're rubbing

up against it like a bad windshield

wiper.

FOCUS DISSOLVE TO:

ERIC

There.  That's Notre Dame.

RICARDO

Do you like French cars?

ZED

(answering Enrique's question)

Yes.

RICARDO

I like the Cadillac.  Fifty-two to

seventy-five.  Very nice.

ERIC

Up here you can see the Eiffel tower.

ZED

Is tomorrow really Bastille day?

ERIC

Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in

French history.  And spend the rest of

our lives in Monte Carlo.

CLAUDE

[Faster, faster...go faster.  Let's beat

them!]

RICARDO

[Shit!  That bastard.]

ERIC

(to Ricardo)

Watch it!  Don't crash my car.

ERIC

Over here is where the male prostitutes

sell themselves.  Do you see?

OLIVER

(out the window)

Fucking fags!

ERIC

(also out the window)

Suce ma bite?!

RICARDO

Perverts d'homosexuels!

ERIC

(into Zed's ear)

This is good to have you here.  We could

not do this without you.

ERIC

Everyone has agreed to give you double

shares.  That's good.

ERIC

You know I have AIDS.  From the needle.

ZED

Really?

ERIC

Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe.

CUT TO:

OLIVER

So, how long have you known Eric?

ZED

Well, Eric's mother is American.

OLIVER

Yeah, and his dad's French.

ZED

They're divorced.  And she and his father

had some kind of six month split plan set

up.  So every six months he would come

back to the states.  We were best

friends.  Eventually he and his mother

had a falling out and he stayed here.

It's been...years.

OLIVER

Well, it's good to have you here.  Eric

speaks fairly highly of you.  Say, he

says you're a big fan of Viking films.

ZED

Well...I suppose.  I used to be, when I

was young.

OLIVER

Oh they're the best.  Helmets with horns

on them.  Shit.  That's fucking genius.

OLIVER

How 'bout Toy Jazz?  You like it?

ZED

Yeah...I guess.

OLIVER

I love it.  It's really good, you know?

Like real music.  It has a heart and

culture all it's own.  It's, like, jazz

for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen.

Total purity of essence.

ZED

Yeah.

OLIVER

Hungry cannibals'd like it.

CLAUDE

Here, you must drink some of this wine,

it's good.

OLIVER

(to Claude)

Non merci, c'est de la merde.

CLAUDE

(to Oliver)

La ferme.  C'est du bon vin.

(to Zed)

The fucking English.

OLIVER

Look at him.  He's crazy.

ERIC

I'm glad you came.  How long has it been?

ZED

Years.

as though the rest of the world is in a

bubble of glass and that you're rubbing

up against it like a bad windshield

wiper.

FOCUS DISSOLVE TO:

ERIC

There.  That's Notre Dame.

RICARDO

Do you like French cars?

ZED

(answering Enrique's question)

Yes.

RICARDO

I like the Cadillac.  Fifty-two to

seventy-five.  Very nice.

ERIC

Up here you can see the Eiffel tower.

ZED

Is tomorrow really Bastille day?

ERIC

Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in

French history.  And spend the rest of

our lives in Monte Carlo.

CLAUDE

[Faster, faster...go faster.  Let's beat

them!]

RICARDO

[Shit!  That bastard.]

ERIC

(to Ricardo)

Watch it!  Don't crash my car.

ERIC

Over here is where the male prostitutes

sell themselves.  Do you see?

OLIVER

(out the window)

Fucking fags!

ERIC

(also out the window)

Suce ma bite?!

RICARDO

Perverts d'homosexuels!

ERIC

(into Zed's ear)

This is good to have you here.  We could

not do this without you.

ERIC

Everyone has agreed to give you double

shares.  That's good.

ERIC

You know I have AIDS.  From the needle.

ZED

Really?

ERIC

Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe.

CUT TO:

OLIVER

So, how long have you known Eric?

ZED

Well, Eric's mother is American.

OLIVER

Yeah, and his dad's French.

ZED

They're divorced.  And she and his father

had some kind of six month split plan set

up.  So every six months he would come

back to the states.  We were best

friends.  Eventually he and his mother

had a falling out and he stayed here.

It's been...years.

OLIVER

Well, it's good to have you here.  Eric

speaks fairly highly of you.  Say, he

says you're a big fan of Viking films.

ZED

Well...I suppose.  I used to be, when I

was young.

OLIVER

Oh they're the best.  Helmets with horns

on them.  Shit.  That's fucking genius.

OLIVER

How 'bout Toy Jazz?  You like it?

ZED

Yeah...I guess.

OLIVER

I love it.  It's really good, you know?

Like real music.  It has a heart and

culture all it's own.  It's, like, jazz

for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen.

Total purity of essence.

ZED

Yeah.

OLIVER

Hungry cannibals'd like it.

CLAUDE

Here, you must drink some of this wine,

it's good.

OLIVER

(to Claude)

Non merci, c'est de la merde.

CLAUDE

(to Oliver)

La ferme.  C'est du bon vin.

(to Zed)

The fucking English.

OLIVER

Look at him.  He's crazy.

CUT TO:

SUB LOBBY TELLER

(to assistant)

[Do the phones work?]

SUB LOBBY ASSISTANT

[They went dead.]

SUB LOBBY TELLER

Merde!

ERIC

(to the guard)

[Drop the gun!]

ERIC

[Drop your gun now and nobody dies!]

ERIC

[Good boy.]

CUT TO:

CLAUDE

[I'm going to check things out

downstairs.]

RICARDO

(to the people)

[Now!  On the ground!  Face down!]

CUT TO:

CLAUDE

[All clear down here?]

ERIC

[Take these two upstairs.  And chain the

gate to the sub lobby shut.]

CLAUDE

[The phones and video are down!  We're

locked up tight!]

(then in English)

We fucking did it!

ERIC

[Any others I should worry about?]

BANK MANAGER

[No.]

ERIC

(to Oliver)

[Well, just to be sure--]

OLIVER

[Freeze motherfucker!]

ERIC

[Who the fuck are you?]

STODGY CUSTOMER

[Please don't shoot me!]

OLIVER

[On the ground!]

ERIC

(to the bank manager)

[Making a deposit I hope.]

(he smiles to Oliver)

[Bring him with us.]

BANK MANAGER

(to the sub lobby teller)

[Vault locked?]

SUB LOBBY TELLER

[Yes.]

ERIC

[Shut your fucking mouths!]

BANK MANAGER

(to Eric)

[The vault doors are shut and time

locked.  You won't be able to open them.]

ERIC

(to the bank manager)

[You think we're fucking amateurs?  You

think we're stupid?  I've got news for

you...we planned ahead my friend!]

ERIC

[Now save us a lot of time and just open

the vault.]

BANK MANAGER

[No.]

ERIC

[Okay.]

ERIC

[Open the vault.]

BANK MANAGER

[I cannot.]

ERIC

[Oh.]

(to the teller)

[Can you?]

BANK MANAGER

[No.  Once closed only I can open it.]

ERIC

[Then open it.]

BANK MANAGER

[I cannot.]

ERIC

[Do you understand that I'll kill her if

you don't open this fucking vault?]

BANK MANAGER

[Do you understand that this is an

international reserve bank?  Robbing it

is punishable by life imprisonment.]

ZED

Jesus fucking Christ!

ERIC

[Open the vault door or I'll kill this

man next.]

BANK MANAGER

[I still cannot open the vault.]

ERIC

[Come on.  It's only things in there.

This man is flesh and blood.]

BANK MANAGER

[I will not open the vault.]

ZED

Eric no!  I can open the vault!

ERIC

Shut the fuck up!

(then to the stodgy customer)

[You're a customer in this bank and this

is how they treat you.  Do you have a

family?]

ERIC

[Would you like to see them again?]

ERIC

(to the manager)

[This man has a family he would like to

have Bastille day dinner with tonight.

So save us some time and open the vault.]

BANK MANAGER

[No.]

ERIC

Fucking idiot.

(then to the stodgy customer)

[You seem like a nice man.  Tonight at

dinner think about how lucky you are and

how much you love your family.]

STODGY CUSTOMER

Oui.

ERIC

(to Oliver)

[Take him upstairs.]

ERIC

Don't you ever conflict with me during

work again!  Do you hear!?

ZED

You didn't have to shoot any of them!

ERIC

(patronizing)

Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you were

in charge now.  Nobody told me.

(his temper flares)

If he had opened the vault it would have

saved us a fucking hour.

ZED

Eric.  It's just that we've gone from

being thieves to murderers.

ERIC

Oh fuck it doesn't matter!  Here you get

the death penalty just for robbing a

federal bank.

ZED

I thought the death penalty was abolished

in 1980?

ERIC

Ohhhh!  That's what they tell you!  But

who cares?  I need to take a piss.

ERIC

(on his way into the bathroom)

Why don't you open the vault?

CUT TO:

FRANCOIS

[Looks clear.]

JEAN

[What do you mean you're not sure if the

alarm went off or not?]

RICARDO

[I mean I'm not sure.]

JEAN

[Well, either it did or it didn't.]

RICARDO

[And I'm not sure.]

JEAN

[Well, do you think it did?]

RICARDO

[I just fucking told you, I don't know.]

JEAN

[Take a guess.]

RICARDO

[It didn't.]

JEAN

[You're sure?]

RICARDO

[No.  It's just a guess.]

JEAN

[Well what kind of a fucking guess is

that?  You're saying it could have.]

RICARDO

[Yes.]

JEAN

[Well that's fucking great.  Why didn't

you just kill that asshole to begin with.

I knew I should have been the one to kill

him.  You're always so damn slow.]

RICARDO

[Shit these masks are really hot.]

CLAUDE

[I know, I've got fucking sweat stinging

my eyes.]

CUT TO:

JEAN

(in French to Ricardo)

[Do you know one?]

RICARDO

[Let's see.  Okay.  An unfortunate fellow

was locked up in prison doing five to ten

for armed robbery.  All he could think of

the whole time was eating pussy.]

RICARDO

[The day finally came for his release.

He walked out of the prison with a new

suit and fifty francs the officials had

given him, and made a bee-line for the

whorehouse in the nearest town.  Slamming

his fifty francs on the front desk, he

said, "I wanna eat some pussy."]

RICARDO

[I'm not done.  Listen.  "Where've you

been," said the greasy fellow behind the

desk, "fifty francs won't get you a close

look these days."]

RICARDO

["Listen buddy," said the ex-convict,

pulling him out of his chair by the shirt

collar, "I wanna eat some pussy, and I

want it now!"]

RICARDO

["Okay, okay," gasped the proprietor,

"I'll see what I can do."  So the ex-con

followed him through to the very back of

the warehouse through some stained,

tattered red curtains, and into a grimy

little room where a bedraggled looking

whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed.

"She's yours for fifty francs," said the

proprietor, and the fellow went at it.]

RICARDO

[After a little while, he came across a

piece of egg.  "That's funny," he thought

to himself, "I don't think I had egg for

breakfast."  But he spat it out and kept

eating away.  Next he found a piece of

chipped beef wedged between his front

teeth.  "I'm sure I haven't eaten chipped

beef this week," he thought, but kept on.

Then he came across the corn.  "What is

this?" he said, "I think I'm going to be

sick."]

RICARDO

["Ya know," says the whore, "that's what

the last guy said."]

CLAUDE

[No one fucking moves!]

JEAN

[Shit!  What happened!?]

CUT TO:

ERIC

What is it?  What's going on?

ZED

I don't know.

ERIC

No!  You stay here.

CUT TO:

JEAN

[Nobody fucking moves!  Nobody fucking

moves!]

CLAUDE

[The gun!  Somebody get it!]

OLIVER

[Don't fuck with me!  Don't fuck with

me!]

ERIC

[What the fuck is going on!?]

OLIVER

(pointing at the dead man)

[This crazy fuck shot Ricardo!]

JEAN

(quietly)

[Eric, your mask.]

ERIC

Oh shit.

OLIVER

Who gives a damn if they see us or not

anyway!  I can't see a fucking think in

this!

ERIC

[Is this what happens?  Is this what

happens when I walk away for five

minutes?]

CLAUDE

[He had a hidden gun.]

ERIC

(mimicking a little child)

[He had a hidden gun.]

(then back to normal)

[I don't care!]

MALE TOURIST

(holding up his passport)

This is insane!  I am a U.S. citizen!

You must let me go!

MALE TOURIST

I'm an American!  American!  I'm just

here exchanging dollars.  If it wasn't

for my country you'd all be speaking

German!

ERIC

(to the people)

[I have had enough of this nonsense!  The

next person that speaks will die!]

JEAN

[Eric, I'm sorry.  Things got out of

hand.  But we're in control now.]

ERIC

[Good.  Let's try to keep it that way.

God what a mess.]

CLAUDE

Eric

ERIC

[What the fuck is it now!?  You want me

to hold your hand as you take a piss?]

CLAUDE

[I have a question.]

ERIC

[What?]

CLAUDE

[Do we know if the alarm went off or

not?]

ERIC

[Yes.]

CLAUDE

[We do?]

ERIC

[Yes.  It didn't go off.  If it had the

police would be here and our whole plan

would be fucked.  But they're not here,

and our plan isn't fucked.  So if there

aren't any more fucking stupid questions

I'll go downstairs and see if we're in

yet.  Is that okay with you?]

ERIC

[I thought the phones were dead.]

OLIVER

The phones are dead.

ERIC

[Answer it!]

ERIC

[Answer it or you will die.]

WOMAN TELLER

(answering phone through tears)

Banque Internationale de Paris.

WOMAN TELLER

[It's for you.]

ERIC

(into phone)

[Hello.]

(pause)

[Who is this?]

OLIVER

Oh my God!  The police!

ERIC

(into phone)

[What do you want?]

ERIC

(into phone)

[We're all fine in here.]

ERIC

(into phone)

[No.  I'll tell you what, you go fuck

yourself you fucking pig.  You send

anyone near this building and I'll kill

the first person I lay my hands on.  I've

got plenty hostages here to kill so don't

even think of coming in.]

(pause)

[Just stay put.  We'll call you when

we're ready.  In the mean time, have a

nice day.]

CLAUDE

[The silent alarm must have gone off

after all!]

ERIC

[Shut the fuck up!  The alarm didn't do

shit.  For all we know your idiot

shooting brought them here.  Anyhow it

doesn't matter.  Nothing has changed.]

JEAN

[My God!  The police!  What are we going

to do?]

ERIC

[Nothing.  We don't have to do anything.

The plan stays the same, just slightly

different.]

ERIC

[If the police decide to come in...kill

them.  And if you don't mind, stack those

bodies somewhere else.  This place is a

fucking mess and it's bad for morale.]

CUT TO:

ZED

(turning to Eric)

What's going on?

ERIC

Nothing.  They were just scaring them.

ZED

Well, did you tell them to stay quiet?

ERIC

Yes.  They're assholes.  Just having fun.

ZED

Fucked up my drill bit.

ERIC

It's okay.  You can buy another one.

ZED

Cross your fingers.

ZED

Perfect.

ERIC

Excellent.  What next?

ZED

We find the fuse box.  It'll probably be

upstairs.

ERIC

It's okay.  I'll find it for you.

ZED

No.  I need to see it myself.

ERIC

I think it would be better if I looked

for you.  I could--

ZED

Hold on.  Here she is.

ZED

Let's see.

ZED

Okay, you throw this fuse switch off and

then back on when I call to you.  Any

other switch may set off the alarm.

ERIC

Oh, I wouldn't want to do that.

ZED

(serious)

Got it?

ERIC

(nodding)

Got it.

ZED

Come on sweetie don't fail me now.

ZED

(calling to Eric)

Ready?!

ERIC(O.S.)

(calling back)

Ready!

ZED

Now!

ZED

Open seasame.

ERIC

It worked!

ERIC

Oh my God it worked!

ZED

I can get through that lock in a minute.

ERIC

Then do it.  We don't have all day.

ZED

Dime store brand.  Three minutes max.

ERIC

Good.

ZED

Fuck!

ERIC

Merde!

ZED

Jesus Christ!

ZED

Another security guard?

ERIC

Must be.

ZED

I think I stained my pants.

ERIC

Me too.

OLIVER

What is it?!  I came down to see how

things were going and heard shots!

ERIC

Some asshole in the vault.

OLIVER

We've got guns.  Why don't we just storm

in and blast his fucking ass!  It's three

against one!  Let's give it the old--

ERIC

Quiet!

OLIVER

I'm just trying to be helpful.

ERIC

Just let me think.

OLIVER

You don't have to snap at me.

ERIC

(calling into the vault)

[Hey you.  Nice shooting.  Play time's

over.  Why don't you throw out your gun?]

VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)

(calling from main vault)

No!

ERIC

[Come on.  We don't want to kill you.]

VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)

[You'll have to!]

ERIC

(quietly to Zed)

What is this guys problem?

(then to the guard)

[Come on!  You're making me impatient.  I

don't have all day.]

VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)

[Look, don't take it personally.  This is

my job.]

ERIC

[Then take a paid vacation.  We won't

tell if you won't.]

ZED

(quietly)

What the Hell are you doing?  Have you

gone mad?

VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)

[Sorry.  I can't.]

ERIC

[Well, look, we're going to give you

fifteen minutes to change your mind.

Okay?]

VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)

[Okay.]

ZED

(holding his voice down)

That's too much.  It's dangerous.

ERIC

I like danger.

(then to the guard)

[Changed your mind yet?]

VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)

[No.  And I'm not going to.  Why don't

you just take the money from the other

vaults?--]

CUT TO:

FRANCOIS

[Should we see if they're okay?]

JEAN

[No.  They're just blasting the vault

open.]

CLAUDE

[What does it matter now?  We're fucking

surrounded by police.]

CUT TO:

ZED

You asshole!  You could have killed us

all.

ERIC

But I didn't!  Let's go check out the

damage.

ERIC

Zed look!

ERIC

I beat you!  I opened it in under three

minutes.

ZED

(to Oliver)

Go around and wait at the main vault

door.  When I tell you, open it up.

OLIVER

Right.  When you tell me, I'll open it

up.

ZED

Right.

OLIVER

Right.

OLIVER

I'll be at the other vault waiting for

you to call to me.

ERIC

Look at it!  We're all rich!

ERIC

We're rich!

ERIC

We're rich!

ZED

We're not out of here yet.

ERIC

Yes but we're rich!

ERIC

I'm going to show the others.

CUT TO:

CLAUDE

[What?  You think we may actually get out

of this?  You're fooling yourself.]

JEAN

[Why are you such a pessimist?]

CLAUDE

[Are you kidding me?  Look at this mess.]

CLAUDE

[This is nothing.  Imagine the police

outside.  We're dead men.]

ERIC

[Jean, Francois, Claude...look at this.]

JEAN

[You did it!  You got in!]

ERIC

[Zed is opening the vault now.  This is a

taste.]

ERIC

[Look at this and tell me I'm not

brilliant.]

WOMAN CUSTOMER

(crying)

[You're a monster!  And you'll never

leave this place alive!]

ERIC

(to the hostages)

[None of you are worth half of this

single bar.  Remember that.]

CLAUDE

[Eric...can I speak with you?]

ERIC

[Of course.]

CLAUDE

[In private.]

ERIC

[There's no need.  I have nothing to

hide.  What is it Claude?]

CLAUDE

[Well...we're surrounded by the police

and we have no way out.  What are we

going to do?]

ERIC

[What are you doing Claude?  Talking of

all this false doubt.  What do you think

we're going to do?]

CLAUDE

[I don't know...not the original plan.]

ERIC

[Obviously, since Ricardo fucked us up

and didn't kill the concierge fast

enough.  And killing all these assholes--

]

(motioning to all the

customers)

[--isn't going to do us a damn bit of

good now, is it?]

CLAUDE

No.

ERIC

[No.  Because we'll need them as hostages

when we get on the plane.]

CLAUDE

[We're going on a plane?]

ERIC

[Claude, you are a mental giant.  Leave

the plans up to me and just kill people

if they get out of line, okay?]

CLAUDE

[Okay.]

ERIC

[I'm going to see how things are going.]

ERIC

[They want to fuck with me!?  They want

to fuck with me!?]

ERIC

[You want to fuck with me!?  I'll show

you what happens to people who fuck with

me!]

ERIC

it would come.]

ZOEY

(screeching)

No!

ASSISTANT MANAGER

[No!  What ever it is you're going to do

have mercy!]

ERIC

[Have mercy?]

ASSISTANT MANAGER

[Yes.]

ERIC

[With her.]

ASSISTANT MANAGER

[Yes.]

ERIC

[That's sweet.]

(to Zoey)

[You have quite a reach my lovely.  Is he

one of your clients?]

ERIC

[It's a deal.]

ASSISTANT MANAGER

[Thank you.]

ERIC

[Don't mention it.]

CLAUDE

[Eric!  What are you doing?]

ERIC

[Clearing up the "how full of shit am I"

question the cops are asking themselves

right now.]

ERIC

(into phone)

[Hello.]

(pause)

[Yes.  I'll hold.]

(then to Claude)

[I'm holding.]

ERIC

(into phone)

[Hello.]

(pause)

[You don't know the fucking half of it.

So just shut the fuck up and listen.  Try

any more stunts and I'll fucking really

go crazy.]

(pause)

[Well that's good because if you faggot

cops even think of it I'll kill some more

people.  Hear?]

(pause)

[No.  None of that.  We won't trade.

That never works.  Not in the movies, not

in real life.  Understand?  We're going

to get into our van, with a couple of

people, go to the airport, and fly out of

this shit hole city.  And you're not

going to follow us.]

(pause)

[Who do you fucking think is going to

supply the plane?  Us?  No, you fucking

imbecile, the French taxpayers would be a

good second guess for you.  You're really

pissing me off.  You think I'm a fucking

amature?]

ZED

Open seasame.

Do you want to give me a hand?

OLIVER

Sure.

OLIVER

Holy mother.

ZED

Here, help me with this.

CUT TO:

ERIC

Merde!

ERIC

[That's what you get!]

CLAUDE

Eric.

ERIC

[The fucking police won't budge.  I kill

a man and they don't care.  They say they

don't make deals with terrorists.  It

really fucks up my plan.]

CLAUDE

[And what if we gave up?]

ERIC

(laughing)

[Claude, look around you.  We're not

talking prison here.  You know.  The cops

will give in.  You start killing

women...they give in.  They're all so

fucking much in love with women!]

ERIC

[What are you looking at you fucking

whore?]

ERIC

[Are you afraid I'll tell these people

that this is only a day job for you?]

ERIC

[What?  So they know that you're a--]

SUB LOBBY ASSISTANT

[Leave her alone.]

ERIC

[Shut up!]

ERIC

[My only mistake was not to make an

example of a woman to begin with.]

CUT TO:

OLIVER

This is unbelievable.  Look at all of

this.  It's wonderful to touch.

ZED

Just help me steer this out.

OLIVER

Do you think we should get some cash

also?

ZED

What for?

OLIVER

Well, you never know.

ZED

Money is too easily traceable.  You'd

never be able to spend it.  And forget

about exchanging it.

OLIVER

That's true.

ZED

No sir.  Your best bet is to get these

bars melted down in Tunisia or Korea.

OLIVER

Eric knows someone in Portugal.

ZED

Or Portugal.

CUT TO:

ERIC

(groaning)

[You fucking bitch!]

ERIC

[Bitch!]

CUT TO:

ZED

Do we have a covering of some kind?

OLIVER

A what?

ZED

You know.  Something to cover this with.

It'll look kind of conspicuous leaving

the bank with a platten of gold.

OLIVER

Oh, it won't matter.  The police know

what we're up too.

ZED

Police?!  What do you mean they know what

we're up too?

OLIVER

You don't know?  We've been discovered.

But Eric has them under control.

ZED

No I didn't know!  How many police?

OLIVER

The building is surrounded.

ERIC

Kill her!  Kill her!

ERIC

What the fuck are you doing!?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CLAUDE

[They're trying to smoke us out Eric!]

FRANCOIS

[What do we do!?]

ERIC

Do you really love your bitch whore

girlfriend that much?  She's really

fucked with your mind.

ZED

Eric...what are you talking about?

ERIC

Look at it.  It's all for us.  The smoke.

The attention.  They have no idea of who

they're dealing with.  They have no idea

what kind of men we are.

ZED

(thinking Eric is a madman)

What kind of men are we?

ERIC

You can no longer be in our club.  You

forfeit your cut of the pie.

ZED

What about our friendship?

ERIC

Shit Zed.  I haven't seen you in years.

You hardly know me.

ERIC

Never let a girl come between two men.

ERIC

Now let's try to get out of here.

FRANCOIS

[The police!  They're entering the

building!]

ERIC

(to himself)

[Smoother and more giving than the most

selfless human being.  You're beautiful.]

FRANCOIS

[Eric!]

ERIC

[Jesus, what now?]

FRANCOIS

[The police are coming in!  We're

doomed!]

ERIC

[Get a hostage.]

FRANCOIS

hostages!]

[Don't make me!]

CUT TO:

ZED

(almost delerious)

Zoe...

ZOE

(holding him)

My Zed.  They've hurt you.

ZOE

(trying to comfort him)

You're going to be okay.  In many

countries scars on the face are a symbol

of heroism.  To proudly display a flaw

like a badge...is to wear a badge of

truth.

ZED

Be serious Zoe...I can stick my tongue

through my cheek.

CUT TO:

FRANCOIS

Oliver!  Let's get a hostage!

OLIVER

This is the end!

CUT TO:

ZOE

Listen to me.  We're going to lock

ourselves into one of the air tight

vaults...if any of them are still open.

CUT TO:

OLIVER

Bastard!

CUT TO:

ZOE

Merde!  The vault has been closed.

ZED

What about the others?

ZOE

Listen...there's no gunfire.

OLIVER

(to police)

Motherfuckers!

OLIVER

You wanna fuck with me?  You wanna fuck

with me?  I'll show you who you're

fucking with!

ZOEY

C'mon, we'll be safer in here.

CUT TO:

What's your girlfriends name?

[Zoe, come here to me.]

ERIC

[Killing you would just be gravy, so

don't fuck with me.]

ZOEY

[Go ahead you slob.  Shave my ass!]

ERIC

Zed no.  I'll kill you.  It means nothing

to me, our friendship.

ZED

(starting out calm and then

building to a scream)

Eric...there's no fucking way out of

here!

ERIC

Oh but you're wrong.  This is my way out.

This dime store couge with her motor

driven ass.  You find your own.

ERIC

Come Zed...I'm going to cut you like a

sausage.

ZED

Zoey, get out of here!

ERIC

Did you see how she ran?  Did you see how

she ran?  She doesn't care about you.

Fucking pussy only cares about pussy.

Look out for number one.  What do you say

Zed?

ERIC

I will kill you.  And once I kill you

Zed, I'll get out of here.  I'll fuck

your bitch up the ass and give her

AIDS...if she doesn't already have it.

What do you say to that Zed?

ERIC

Fucking bitch!

OLIVER

Ox!  Where is thy yoke!?

ERIC

Fuck both of you.

ERIC

Au revoir.

ZOEY

No!

[My God.  What a Bastille Day.]

FRENCH POLICEMAN #3

(to French policeman #1)

I.D.]

ZOEY

The hospital?

ZED

No.

ZOEY

Come on.  I have a car.

DISSOLVE TO:

ZED

I'm so tired.

ZOEY

We'll go to my flat.  You can rest there.

Do you feel pain?

ZED

No...it was mostly his blood.

ZOEY

I have a shower.  You can clean up there.

ZED

Thank you Zoe.

ZOEY

My name is not Zoe.  Not any more.

ZOEY

You'll get well.  Then I'll show you the

real Paris.

THE END
