Frank's marriage.

to Jim, but has never learned how.

mother-in-law, mated with an ineffectual and joyless

man, she takes out her disappointment on him and on

her son.

filled with confusion about his role in life.  Because

of his "nowhere" father, he does not know how to be a

man.  Because of his wounding mother, he anticipates

destruction in all women.  And yet he wants to find a

girl who will be willing to receive his tenderness.

JUDY'S FAMILY

attractive and debonair.  Because he is frightened by

the adolescence of his daughter, Judy, his only

recourse is to criticize her.

is threatening her wifely position as the desirable

object of the husband's attentions.

love and suffering when it is denied.  This forces her

to invite the attention of other men in order to

punish him.

certain of the love of his father who feels comfortable

in giving it.

desertion. At fifteen he wants to find a substitute

family for himself so that he need no longer feel

cold, and especially a friend who will supply the fatherly

protection and warmth he needs and cannot find.

aggressively his idea of what a man should be in order

to hide his real sensitivities and needs.  He was

probably rejected by both parents and must constantly

court danger and must constantly court danger in order

to achieve any sense of prestige or personal worth.

THE KIDS

searching for recognition in the only way available

to them; all suffering from unfulfilled hungers at

home; all creating an outside world of chaos in order

to bear the chaos they feel inside.  They are

soldiers in search of an enemy.

BUZZ

(friendly, cool)

That was pretty what you were

whistling.  Whistle some more.

BUZZ

(continuing; suddenly)

You got a cigarette?

MAN

Oh, I think so--

MAN

(continuing)

Filter tips.

BUZZ

(smiling, encouraging)

You smoke it.  Smoke it, Dad.

BUZZ

(continuing)

I'll light it for you, Dad.

DISSOLVE TO:

SERGEANT

Mixed up in that beating on Twelfth

Street?

OFFICER

No.  Plain drunkenness.

SERGEANT

This says he was picked up there.

OFFICER

They had him on the carpet for an

hour at Headquarters.  He's clear.

Plain drunkenness.

SERGEANT

Young squirt.  All right--You want

to lean him against something?

Stand him over there.

GENE

You going to tell me your name now?

LITTLE BOY

(touching GENE's bald pate)

Where's your hair?

GENE

It's all gone.

LITTLE BOY

Did you get a haircut?

GENE

No--it just fell out!

LITTLE BOY

(sympathetically)

Aw--

RAY

What gang does he belong to?

GENE

Give him a couple of years.

RAY

Where's your mamma, honey?

LITTLE BOY

I don't know.

RAY

Judy--we're ready for you now.

JUDY

(a mumble)

He hates me.

RAY

What?

JUDY

He hates me.

RAY

What makes you think he hates you,

Judy?

JUDY

I don't think.  I know.  He looks

at me like I'm the ugliest thing in

the world.  He doesn't like my

friends--he--

JUDY

(continuing)

He doesn't like anything about me--

he calls me--he calls me--

RAY

He makes you feel pretty unhappy?

JUDY

(crying)

He calls me a dirty tramp--my own

father!

RAY

Do you think your father means that?

JUDY

Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe

he doesn't mean it but he acts like

he does.  We're altogether and

we're going to celebrate Easter and

catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So

I put on my new dress and I came

out and he--

RAY

That one?

JUDY

Yes--he started yelling for a

handkerchief--screaming.  He

grabbed my face and he rubbed all

my lipstick off--he rubbed till I

thought I wouldn't have any lips

left.  And all the time yelling at

me--that thing--the thing I told

you he called me.  Then I ran out

of the house.

RAY

Is that why you were wandering

around at one o'clock in the morning?

JUDY

I was just talking a walk.  I tried

to call the kids but everybody was

out and I couldn't find them.  I

hate my life.  I just hate it.

RAY

You weren't looking for company,

were you?

JUDY

No.

RAY

Did you stop to talk to anyone,

Judy?

(she is silent)

Do you enjoy that?

JUDY

No.  I don't even know why I do it.

RAY

Do you think you can get back at

your Dad that way?  I mean

sometimes if we can't get as close

to somebody as we'd like we have to

try making them jealous--so they'll

have to pay attention.  Did you

ever think of that?

JUDY

I'll never get close to anybody.

RAY

Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth

Street, Judy.

JUDY

You know where they picked me up!

Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near

there!

RAY

Would you like to go home if we can

arrange it?

(no answer; to WOMAN OFFICER)

Did you notify the parents?

WOMAN OFFICER

She wouldn't give me their number.

RAY

What's your number, Judy?  We'll

see if your Dad will come and get you.

RAY

Unless you really don't want to go

home.

(silence)

Would you rather stay here?

JUDY

Lexington 05549.

OFFICER

Hey!

OFFICER

(continuing)

Hey!  That's enough static out of you.

JIM

Want me to imitate a stupid cop?

OFFICER

Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.

JIM

Yes, ma'am.

NEGRO WOMAN

You shivering, John?  You cold?

JIM

Want my jacket?

JIM

(continuing)

You want my jacket?  It's warm.

RAY

Your mother will be down in a few

minutes, Judy--

JUDY

(clearing)

What?

RAY

Your mother will be down in a few

minutes.

JUDY

(startled)

My mother?

RAY

She's being called for.

JUDY

You said you'd call my father.

RAY

Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.

GENE

John Crawford?

NEGRO WOMAN

Yes, sir.

GENE

Come with me, John.

MOTHER (O.S.)

Jim!

JIM

Happy Easter.

MOTHER

Where were you tonight?  They

called us at the club and I got the

fright of my life!

FATHER

Where were you tonight, Jimbo?

JIM

You think I'm funny?

JIM

(continuing)

Why didn't you take my jacket?

GENE

Do you know why you shot those

puppies, John?

(silence)

Is that what they call you or do

you have a nickname?

PLATO

(a murmur)

Plato.

NEGRO WOMAN

You talk to the man nice now, hear?

He's going to help you.

PLATO

Nobody can help me.

GENE

Can you tell me why you killed the

puppies, Plato?

PLATO

No, sir.  I just went next door to

look at them like I always do.

They were nursing on their mother

and I did it.  I guess I'm just no

good?

GENE

What do you think's going to

happen, you do things like that?

PLATO

I don't know.  End up in the

electric chair?

GENE

Where did you get the gun?

PLATO

In my mother's drawer.

NEGRO WOMAN

She keep it to protect herself, sir.

She scared without a man in the house.

GENE

Where's your mother tonight, Plato?

PLATO

She's away.

NEGRO WOMAN

Seems like she's always going

somewhere.  She got a sister in

Chicago and she go for the holiday.

She says her sister is all the

family she has.

GENE

Where's your father?

NEGRO WOMAN

They not together, sir.  We don't

see him in a long time now.

GENE

Do you hear from him, son?

GENE

You know if the boy ever talked to

a psychiatrist?

PLATO

(smiling a bit)

Head-shrinker?

NEGRO WOMAN

(laughing)

Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in

them!

GENE

Well maybe she better start.

FATHER

I don't see what's so bad about

taking a little drink.

RAY

You don't?

FATHER

No.  I definitely don't.  I did the

sa--

RAY

He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it

looks to me like he had more than a

little drink.

FATHER

(chuckling)

Say, listen--

MOTHER

(to JIM: in intimate,

half-humorous disapproval)

Jim--don't hum.

FATHER

I guess I cut pretty loose in my

day too.

MOTHER

Really, Frank?  When was that?

FATHER

Listen--can't you wait till we get

home?

RAY

Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a

little upset but--

FATHER

Sorry.

RAY

What about you, Jim?  Got anything

to say for yourself?

RAY

Not interested, huh?

MOTHER

Can't you answer?  What's the

matter with you anyhow?

FATHER

He's just loaded, honey.

MOTHER

I was talking to Jim.

FATHER

(to RAY)

Let me just explain to you--we just

moved here, y'understand?  The kid

has no friends yet and--

JIM

Tell him why we moved here.

FATHER

Hold it, Jim.

JIM

You can't protect me.

FATHER

(to JIM)

You mind if I try?  You have to

slam the door in my face?

(to RAY)

I try to get to him--what happens?

(to JIM)

Don't I give you everything you

want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle.

A car--

JIM

You buy me many things.  Thank you.

FATHER

Not just buy!  You hear all this

talk about not lovely your kids

enough.  We give you love and

affection, don't we?

FATHER

Then what is it?  I can't even

touch you anymore but you pull away.

I want to understand you.  Why'd

you get drunk?  You must have had a

reason.

FATHER

Was it because we went to that

party?

(silence)

You know what kind of drunken

brawls those parties turn into--

it's no place for kids.

MOTHER

A minute ago you said you didn't

care if he drinks.

GRANDMA

He said a little drink.

JIM

(exploding)

You're tearing me apart!

MOTHER

What?

JIM

Stop tearing me apart!  You say one

thing and he says another and then

everybody changes back--

MOTHER

That's a fine way to behave!

GRANDMA

(smiling)

Well you know who he takes after!

RAY

Outside, Jim.  Come outside.

RAY

Excuse us a minute?

FATHER

(very overwrought)

Sure.  Sure.

JIM

Someone should put poison in her

epsom salts.

RAY

Grandma?

JIM

Get lost.

RAY

Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.

JIM

Wash up and go home.

RAY

Big tough character.  You don't kid

me, pal.  How come you're not

wearing your boots?

RAY

(continuing)

Too bad you didn't connect.  You

could have gone to Juvenile Hall.

That's what you want, isn't it?

JIM

No.

RAY

Sure it is.  You want to bug us

till we have to lock you up.  Why?

JIM

Leave me alone.

RAY

No.

JIM

I don't know why--!

RAY

Go on--don't give me that.  Someone

giving you hard looks?

JIM

I just get so--

(fighting tears)

Boy, sometimes the temperature goes

way up.

RAY

(suddenly gentle)

Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.

RAY

You feel like you want to blow your

wheels right now?

JIM

All the time!  I don't know what

gets into me--but I keep looking

for trouble and I always--I swear

you better lock me up.  I'm going

to smash somebody--I know it.

RAY

Try the desk.

RAY

That why you moved from the last

town? 'Cause you were in trouble?

You can talk about it if you want

to--I know about it anyway.

Routine check.

JIM

And they think they are protecting

my by moving.

RAY

You were getting a good start in

the wrong direction back there.

Why did you do it?

JIM

Mess that kid up?

JIM

(continuing)

He called me chicken.

RAY

And your folks didn't understand?

JIM

They never do.

RAY

So then you moved?

JIM

They think I'll make friends if we

move.  Just move and everything'll

be roses and sunshine.

RAY

But you don't think that's a solution.

RAY

(continuing)

Things pretty tough for you at home?

JIM

She eats him alive and he takes it.

JIM

What a zoo!

RAY

What?

JIM

A zoo.  He always wants to be my

pal, you know?  But how can I give

him anything when he's--I mean I

love him and I don't want to hurt

him--but I don't know what to do

anymore except maybe die.

RAY

Pretty mixed up?

JIM

If he could--

RAY

"If he could" what?  You mean your

father?

JIM

I mean if he had the guts to knock

Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy

and I bet she'd stop picking.  They

make mush out of him.  Just mush.

One thing I know is I never want to

be like him.

RAY

(interrupts)

Chicken?

JIM

I bet you see right through me,

don't you?

JIM

How can anyone grow up in this circus?

RAY

You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want

some water?

JIM

(as RAY gets a cup of

water from cooler)

Boy--if I had one day when I didn't

have to be all confused and ashamed

of everything--or I felt I belonged

some place.

RAY

(giving him water)

Here.  Look, will you do something

for me?  If the pot starts boiling

again, will you come and see me

before you get yourself in a jam?

Even if you just want to talk--come

in and shoot the breeze.  It's

easier sometimes than talking to

your folks.

JIM

Okay--

RAY

Any time--day or night.  You calmed

down enough to go back now?

JIM

(smiling)

You serious?

JIM

I'm sorry.

MOTHER

All right, darling.

GRANDMA

(to RAY)

This was all very unfortunate, but

he made a mistake and he's sorry--

so we're not going to have any more

trouble.  He's always been a lovely

boy--

JIM

Lovely!  Grandma--if you tell

another lie you're going to turn to

stone.

RAY

Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.

FATHER

(offering RAY three cigars)

Have some cigars.

RAY

No thanks, I don't smoke.

FATHER

Go on--Give 'em to your friends.

RAY

No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.

MOTHER

Frank--he doesn't want any.

FADE OUT.

JUDY

(yelling)

Beau!

JUDY

(yelling)

What are you trying to do, get

yourself killed?

BEAU

(laughing)

Yes!

MOTHER (O.S.)

Your eggs are on the table, dear.

MOTHER

(continuing)

Sit down and eat--you'll be late.

JIM

(approaching table)

It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm

nervous or something--

GRANDMA

It's a wonder we don't all have TB

or some other terrible disease

after living in all those smokey

cities!

MOTHER

Well, drink your milk anyhow.

GRANDMA

(muttering)

There aren't so many factories here.

FATHER

Mother--

JIM

(still standing; he drinks)

You make any sandwiches?

FATHER

My first day of school, mother'd

make me eat and by golly I could

never even swallow till recess--

MOTHER

(bringing bag of

lunch from buffet)

There's nothing to be nervous about.

Here's peanut butter and meat loaf--

GRANDMA

What did I tell you?  Peanut butter!

MOTHER

Well, there's a thermos of orange

juice and some apple-sauce cake in

the wax paper to wash it down.

GRANDMA

I baked that!

JIM

(kisses her cheek)

'Bye, Mom.

MOTHER

Goodbye, dear.

FATHER

(rising)

So long, young fella.  Knock 'em

dead, like your old man used to!

JIM

Sure--

(gets to door and turns)

You know something?  I have a

feeling we're going to stay here.

FATHER

And listen--watch out about the

pals you choose--Know what I mean?

Don't let them choose you--

JUDY (O.S.)

Come out of the alley, Beau!  This

is the last time I'm going to call

you.

JUDY

Beau!  All right--go to school alone!

JIM

(calling)

Hey!

JIM

(continuing)

Hey, didn't I see you before some

place?

JIM

Hi.  I saw you before.

JUDY

Bully for you.

JIM

You don't have to be unfriendly.

JUDY

Now that's true!

JIM

(smiling)

See?

JUDY

"Life is crushing in on me."

JIM

(smiling)

"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I

know where it was.

JUDY

Where what was.

JIM

Where I saw you.

(no answer)

Everything going okay now?

(no answer)

You live around here?

JUDY

(relieved)

Who lives?

JIM

See, I'm new.

JUDY

Won't mother be proud.

JIM

You're really flipped--aren't you.

JIM

(continuing)

Where's Dawson High School?

JUDY

You going there?

JIM

Yeah--why--

JUDY

Dig the square wardrobe!

JIM

(defensively)

Yeah.  So where's the high school?

JUDY

(softer)

University and 10th--Want to carry

my books?

JIM

I was just getting my car.  I could

take you.

JUDY

The kids take me.

JIM

Oh.

JUDY

I'll bet you're a real yo yo.

JIM

A what?

JUDY

(yelling over horn)

Goodbye!  See you!

JIM

(yelling)

I'm not so bad.

BUZZ

Stella-a-a-a!

JUDY

Steady Marlon!

BUZZ

Wanna make the colored lights go

around and around?

BUZZ

(looks after JIM then

at JUDY)

What's that?

JUDY

A new disease.

BUZZ

(a little suspicious)

Friend of yours?

JUDY

I'm glad they let you out.

BUZZ

Nobody chickened.

JUDY

I heard about it.  You're lucky he

lived.

BUZZ

They always live.

JIM

Where's University and 10th?

JUDY

(pointing right)

That way!

CHICK

(pointing left)

That way!

BUZZ

(pointing up)

That way!

DISSOLVE TO:

JIM

Hi--can you tell we where I go?

I'm just starting here.

MONITOR

(pointing at brassard)

Mr. Bassett's office--203.  He'll

tell you where your home room is--

JIM

Thanks a lot.

PLATO

(to himself)

Hi.

PLATO

(clearing his throat)

Hi.

JIM

Hi there.

PLATO

You remember me?

JIM

No.  I don't think so--

PLATO

I'm sorry--I made a mistake.

DISSOLVE TO:

LECTURER (O.S.)

For many days before the end of our

earth people will look into the

night sky and notice a star,

increasingly bright and increasingly

near.

LECTURER (O.S.)

As this star approaches us, the

weather will change.  The great

polar fields of the north and south

will rot and divide, and the seas

will turn warmer.

LECTURER

The last of us search the heavens

and stand amazed.  For the stars

will still be there, moving through

their ancient rhythms.

LECTURER (O.S.)

The familiar constellations that

illuminate our night will seem as

they have always seemed, eternal,

unchanged and little moved by the

shortness of time between our

planet's birth and its demise.

LECTURER (O.S.)

Orion, the Hunter.

JIM

Boy!

PLATO

(leaning forward)

What?

JIM

(surprised)

Once you been up there, you know

you been some place!

LECTURER (O.S.)

Gemini, the Twins.

LECTURER (O.S.)

(continuing)

Cancer, the Crab.

BUZZ

I'm a crab!

LECTURER (O.S.)

Taurus, the Bull.

JIM

(in good imitation)

Moo!

CRUNCH

(flat)

Yeah, moo.

BUZZ

Moo.  That's real cute.  Moo.

GOON

Hey, he's real rough--

CRUNCH

I bet he fights with cows.

BUZZ

Moo.

LECTURER (O.S.)

Sagittarius and Aries--all as they

have ever been.

PLATO

You shouldn't monkey with him.

JIM

What?

PLATO

He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard

to make friends with them.

JIM

I don't want to make friends.

LECTURER (O.S.)

And while the flash of our

beginning has not yet traveled the

light years into distance--

LECTURER (O.S.)

Has not yet been seen by planets

deep within the other galaxies, we

will disappear into the blackness

of the space from which we came.

LECTURER (O.S.)

Destroyed as we began in a burst of

gas and fire.

LECTURER (O.S.)

(continuing)

The heavens are still and cold once

more.  In all the complexity of our

universe and the galaxies beyond,

the Earth will not be missed.

LECTURER (O.S.)

Through the infinite reaches of

space, the problems of Man seem

trivial and naive indeed.  And Man,

existing alone, seems to be an

episode of little consequences.

LECTURER (O.S.)

That's all.  Thank you very much.

JIM

Hey, it's over.  The world ended.

PLATO

What does he know about Man alone?

TEACHER

(shrill)

May I have your attention?  May I

please have your attention?

Classes will meet at the busses

outside.  May I have your attention?

(to herself)

The heck with it.

PLATO

Excuse me.  Excuse me.

MALE TEACHER

John, where you going?

PLATO

I forgot something.  I'll get a hitch.

BUZZ

What you looking at?

PLATO

Nothing.

PLATO

(screaming as if he

were yelling "fire!")

What's your name!

JIM

Jim.  What's yours?

PLATO

(a little quieter)

Plato.  It's a nickname.

PLATO

Listen, I told you not to fool with

them.  Now they're waiting for you.

JIM

I know.  That's why I came back.

PLATO

You scared?

JIM

I just don't want trouble.

PLATO

He has a knife.

JIM

I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing

swing, will you?  Do you think it

never stops?

PLATO

No.  It's perpetual motion.

JIM

Oh, I bet some little guy comes in

here at night and pushes it.  Go-

go-go!

PLATO

Jim?

JIM

I'm here.

PLATO

(coming with him)

They're still there!

PLATO

Jim--Do you think when the end of

the world comes it'll be at night?

JIM

No.  In the morning.

JIM

I just have a feeling.

PLATO

If you don't want trouble, I know a

place we can go--

PLATO

It's a big mansion and we could

sneak around there and they

wouldn't even know.  You could be

safe--

PLATO

There it is.

PLATO

Should we go?

JIM

(quietly)

The shadows are getting long.

HELEN

(smiling)

Le soleil tombe dans la mer.

JIM

(wearily)

You know something?

BUZZ

What?

JIM

(reproachfully)

You watch too much television.

BUZZ

Hey, he's real abstract and different.

JIM

I'm cute, too.

JIM

Meaning me?

BUZZ

What?

JIM

Chicken?

JIM

You shouldn't call me that.

JIM

(softly to JUDY)

You always at ringside?  You always

travel in this rank company?

JIM

I thought only punks fought with

knives.

BUZZ

Who's fighting?  This is the test,

man.  It's a crazy game.

HELEN

Les jeux de courage!

CRUNCH

(wetting his lips)

Machismo.  Machismo.

JIM

Machismo?

BUZZ

Somebody find him a knife.

PLATO

Jim!

BUZZ

You know the action?  No cutting.

Just sticking--jab real cool.

BUZZ

(as he maneuvers)

What you waiting on, Toreador?  I

thought you wanted some action!

BUZZ

Big brave bull.  Hah!  Toro!  Hah!

Hah!

GOON

Moo!

BUZZ

Come on--Fascinate us.  Impress us.

What's happening?  Let's go!

JIM

I don't want trouble.

BUZZ

(furious suddenly)

You crud chicken!  You're wasting

our time!

BUZZ

Yeah--that's pretty close.  How

about a little closer, Toreador?

Cut off a button and you get to

join the club!

GUIDE

(turning)

Mr. Minton!  Mr. Minton!  Trouble!

GUIDE

Look.  There's your audience.

LECTURER

Oh, I don't think so.  From the

school?

GROUP

Ole!  Ole!

MIL

Buzzy!  Look out!  He's got a chain!

BUZZ

(smiling as he sees PLATO)

Hey!  Chicken Little!

JIM

All right--you want it, you got it!

CRUNCH

Honk.  Let's split.

BUZZ

Split for what?  Couple old poopheads?

JIM

You satisfied or you want more?

BUZZ

How 'bout you?  Say the word and

you're cold, Jack--you're dead.

JUDY

Buzzie--we better get out of here.

BUZZ

What's eating you, Judy?  You want

him alive?

JIM

Where can we meet?

BUZZ

Know the Millertown bluff?

COOKIE

The bluff, Buzz!  That's dangerous

up there.

BUZZ

Draw him a picture, Chicken Little.

Eight o'clock.  Cookie, you call

Moose and get a couple cars.  We're

going to have us some real kicks.

Little chickie-run.  You been on

chickie-runs before?

JIM

Sure--that's all I do.

GUIDE

All right--all of you--start moving!

JUDY

You mean l'il ol' us?  What's the

matter with the nice man?

GUIDE

Don't clown with me.

BUZZ

Why'nt you go suck on something sweet?

GUIDE

You think you're tough?  I got a

son twice your size and I can still

handle him.

LECTURER

Don't lose control, Mr. Jamison.  I

think if we just explain--

GUIDE

Explain to these?  They think they

own the world!

CRUNCH

The world is round!

MIL

The world is flat!

COOKIE

All the world's a stage!

KIDS

The world goes round the sun!

Goodbye proud world!

I got the world on a string!

The world's my oyster!

Hey!  A fish-eater!  Brain food.

LECTURER

(smiling wanly, to JIM)

Sometimes the world is too much

with us, isn't it, son?  What was

the disturbance?

JIM

Nothing.

LECTURER

You're bleeding.  Are you all right?

JIM

I scratched my mosquito bites.  I'm

fine.

JIM

I'm fine--thanks!

PLATO

Are you really going to meet them?

JIM

Who knows.  Plato?

PLATO

What?

JIM

What's a chickie-run?

DISSOLVE TO:

JIM

Mom?

FATHER

Hiya, Jimbo.

FATHER

You thought I was Mom?

JIM

Yeah!

FATHER

It's just this get-up.  The girl's

out and I was bringing Mom's supper.

JIM

(giggling)

And you dropped it?

FATHER

(laughing too)

Yeah!  Shh!

JIM

That's funny!

FATHER

I better clean this up before she

sees it.

JIM

Let her see.  What could happen.

JIM

Dad--

JIM

Dad--don't.  Don't.

ANNOUNCER

Time now for the seven o'clock news.

Friends, the next time you go

shopping.

JUDY'S FATHER (O.S.)

Judy.

JUDY'S FATHER

What are you wishing for, Judy?

JUDY

(softly)

I wasn't wishing.  I was looking at

the moon.

JUDY'S FATHER

(singing lightly)

"Man in the Moon, how came you

there--

Up in the sky where you are

shining--

Floating so high in the frosty

air--?

Oh, say--Man in the Moon!"--

JUDY

(astonished)

How did you know that?

JUDY'S FATHER

We used to sing it in school.

(smiles)

Don't look at me with such horror.

They had schools in those days.

JUDY

But the same song.  I think it's

fantastic!

JUDY'S FATHER

We were romantic then too--

JUDY

Are you and Mom home tonight?

JUDY'S FATHER

No.  Why?

JUDY

Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend

an evening together for a change.

JUDY'S FATHER

With us old creeps?  Come on, we

have to eat.

JUDY

(rising)

Daddy--

JUDY

Good evening.

JUDY'S FATHER

Hi.

JUDY

(quietly, afraid)

Didn't you forget something?

JUDY'S FATHER

What?

JUDY'S FATHER

(continuing; shocked)

What's the matter with you?

JUDY'S FATHER

(continuing)

You're too old for that kind of

stuff, kiddo.  I thought you

stopped doing that long ago.

JUDY

(very hurt)

I didn't want to stop.

JUDY'S MOTHER

Didn't want to stop what?

JUDY'S FATHER

Nothing.

JUDY

I was talking to Dad.

JUDY'S FATHER

I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.

JUDY'S MOTHER

(calling to kitchen)

Bertha!  You can serve the souffle!

(to FATHER)

Fish souffle.

(to JUDY)

You don't have to stand there,

darling.  Drink your tomato juice.

JUDY

I guess I just don't understand

anything.

JUDY'S FATHER

I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to

change the subject.

JUDY

Why?

JUDY'S FATHER

I'd like to, that's all.  Girls

your age don't do that.  You need

an explanation?

JUDY

(very low)

Girls don't love their father?

Since when?  Since I got to be

sixteen?

JUDY'S FATHER

Stop it now!  Sit down!

JUDY'S FATHER

(thickly)

Hi, rascal.

BEAU

(hushed)

Hi.

JUDY

May I please be excused?

JUDY'S FATHER

(softly)

Hey, hey, Glamorpuss.  I'm sorry.

JUDY'S FATHER

(continuing)

I don't know what to do.  All of a

sudden she's a problem.

JUDY'S MOTHER

She'll outgrow it, dear.  It's just

the age.

BEAU

(in a sudden burst)

The atomic age!

JUDY'S MOTHER

(kissing her

husband's hair)

It's the age when nothing fits.

FATHER

You awake?

JIM

Yes.

FATHER

Listen--I took a steak out of the

freezer.  I thought we could have a

real old-fashioned stag party--just

the two of us, what do you say?

JIM

I'm not hungry.

JIM

Hey--I want to ask you something.

FATHER

(happily)

Shoot, Jimbo.

JIM

Suppose you knew that you had to do

something very dangerous--where you

have to prove something you need to

know--a question of honor.  Would

you do it?

FATHER

(laughing)

Is there some kind of trick answer?

JIM

What would you do, Dad?

FATHER

(evading)

I wouldn't do anything hasty.

Let's get a little light on the

subject.

JIM

Blood.

FATHER

How'd that happen!  What kind of

trouble you in?

JIM

The kind we've been talking about.

Can you answer me now?

FATHER

Listen--nobody should make a snap

decision--This isn't something you

just--we ought to consider all the

pros and cons--

JIM

We don't have time.

FATHER

We'll make time.  Where's some

paper.  We'll make a list and if

we're still stuck then we ought to

get some advice--

JIM

What can you do when you have to be

a man?

FATHER

Well, now--

JIM

Just give me a direct answer!

(pause)

You going to stop me from going, Dad?

FATHER

You know I never stop you from

anything.  Believe me--you're at a

wonderful age.  In ten years you'll

look back on this and wish you were

a kid again.

JIM

Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an

answer now!

FATHER

I just want to show you how foolish

you are.  When you're older you'll

laugh at yourself for thinking this

is so important--

FATHER (O.S.)

Jim?  Will you listen?  You can't

go out till we--Jim!

FATHER

Jim?  Jim!

CRUNCH

Hey, Buzz!

BUZZ

COOKIE

JIM

How'd you get here?

PLATO

I hitched.

JIM

Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.

PLATO

My personality's showing again.

Should I leave?

JIM

No.  It's okay.

BUZZ

Come on.  Let's see what we're

driving.

BUZZ

Just him.

JIM

Stay there.

BUZZ

What you say your name was?

JIM

Jim Stark.

BUZZ

Buzz Gundersen.

JIM

Hi.

BUZZ

Glad to meet you.

MOOSE

Got some goodies for you, Buzzie-boy.

BUZZ

Flashlight?

BUZZ

Looks good.

MOOSE

Clean as a whistle.  They both got

plenty breeze.

BUZZ

Look good to you?

JIM

Sure.  It's fine.

BUZZ

Okay.

JUDY

Is he your friend?

PLATO

Yes.  My best friend.

JUDY

What's he like?

PLATO

Oh, I don't know.  You have to get

to know him.  He doesn't say much

but when he does you know he means

it.  He's sincere.

JUDY

Well, that's the main thing--don't

you think so?

PLATO

Maybe next summer he's going to

take me hunting with him--and

fishing.  I want him to teach me

how and I bet he won't get mad if I

goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really

James but he likes Jim more.

(laughing)

People he really likes--he lets

call him "Jamie."

JUDY

Want to finish my hamburger?  I

only took a bite.

PLATO

Okay.

BUZZ

Better try the doors.  Jump out.

BUZZ

No--quick, man!  You got to break

quick.

BUZZ

(quietly)

This is the edge, boy.  This is the

end.

JIM

Yeah.

BUZZ

I like you, you know?

JIM

Buzz?  What are we doing this for?

BUZZ

(still quiet)

We got to do something.  Don't we?

JUDY

Feel okay?

BUZZ

Give me some dirt.

BUZZ

Hey, Toreador!  She signals.  We

JUDY

Good luck, Buzz.

Thank you.

JIM

I got to go in.  You better get

Hey--what?

PLATO

Why don't you come home with me?  I

mean nobody's home at my house--and

I'm not tired, are you?  I don't

have many--people I can talk to.

JIM

Who has?

PLATO

If you want to come we could talk

and then in the morning we could

have breakfast like my dad used

to--

(pauses--then

excitedly as though

an idea had suddenly

struck him)

Gee...if you could only have been

my father...we could...

JIM

(interrupting)

Hey...you flipped--or something?

You better take off...

PLATO

(suddenly, pleasantly)

O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my

scooter.  See you tomorrow.

JIM

Yeah.

BEAU (O.S.)

(quietly)

Hello, little cute sister.

BEAU

Hello, darling, baby-pie, glamor-

puss, sweetie--

JUDY'S FATHER

(calling from his bed)

Beau!  You belong in bed!

MOTHER

He's home!  You're home!  You're

all right!

MOTHER

What happened, darling.  We were so

worried.  I was going to take a

sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till

I knew you were home.

JIM

I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I

have to talk to you both.  And Dad

this time you got to give me an

answer.

FATHER

Go ahead.

JIM

I'm in terrible trouble.--You know

that big high bluff near Miller-

town Junction?

FATHER

Sure--there was a bad accident

there.  They showed the pictures on

T.V.

JIM

I was in it.

MOTHER

How!

JIM

It doesn't matter how.  I was

driving a stolen car--

MOTHER

Do you enjoy doing this to me or

what--

JIM

Mom--I'm not--

MOTHER

And you wanted him to make a list!

FATHER

Will you let him tell it!

JIM

She never wants to hear.  She

doesn't care!

MOTHER

I guess when I nearly died giving

birth to you--that shows how much I

don't care!

FATHER

Just relax, please relax!

JIM

I told you Dad, it was a question

of honor.  They called me chicken--

you know, chicken!  I had to go or

I would never have been able to

face any of those kids again.  So I

got in one of these cars and a boy

called Buzz got in the other.  We

had to drive fast and jump before

the cars went over the edge of the

bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz

didn't.  He was killed.

MOTHER

Good Lord!

JIM

I can't keep it to myself anymore--

FATHER

Well, just get it off your chest, son.

JIM

That's not what I mean.  I've never

done anything right.  I've been

going around with my head in a

sling for years...I don't want to

drag you into this but I can't help

it.  I don't think I can prove

anything by going around pretending

I'm tough any more, so maybe you

look like one thing but you still

feel like another.

FATHER

You're absolutely right!

JIM

Are you listening to me?  You're

involved in this!  I want to go to

the police and tell them I was

mixed up in this thing tonight?

FATHER

You what?

MOTHER

No!

FATHER

Did anyone see you there?  I mean

did they get your license number or

anything?

JIM

I don't think so--

FATHER

Well--

MOTHER

What about the other boys--Do you

think they'll go to the police?

JIM

What's that got to do with it?

MOTHER

Why should you be the only one.

FATHER

Look Jim.  Far be it from me to

tell you what to do, but there's--

MOTHER

Are you going to preach now?  Are

we going to have a sermon?

FATHER

I'm just explaining what you mean!

You can't be an idealist all your

life!  Nobody thanks you for

sticking your neck out!

MOTHER

That's right!

JIM

Except yourself!

FATHER

Will you wait a minute?

JIM

You don't want me to go.

MOTHER

No!  I don't want you to go to the

police!  There were other people

and why should you be the only one

involved!

JIM

But I am involved!  We're all

involved, Mom!  A boy was killed!

I don't see how we can get out of

that by pretending it didn't happen!

FATHER

You know you did wrong.  That's the

main thing, isn't it?

JIM

No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing!

You always told me to tell the

truth.  You think you can just turn

that off?

MOTHER

He's not saying that!  He's saying

don't volunteer!

JIM

Just tell a little white lie?

FATHER

You'll learn as you get a little

older, Jim.

JIM

I don't want to learn that!

MOTHER

Well, it doesn't matter anyhow--

because we're moving.

JIM

No!  You're not tearing me loose

any more.

MOTHER

Do I have to spell it out?

JIM

You're not going to use me as an

excuse again, Mom.  Every time you

can't face yourself you want to

move and you say it's because of me

or the neighborhood or some other

phony excuse.  Now I want to do one

thing right and I'm not letting you

run away.

(silence)

Dad?

FATHER

Son--this is all happening so fast--

JIM

You better give me something, Dad.

You better give me something

(stops as he sees the

emptiness in them)

Mom?

MOTHER

Jimmy, you're very young--and a

foolish decision now could wreck

your whole life.

JIM

Dad--answer her--aren't you going

to stand up for me?

JIM

Dad?

MOTHER

Stop it!  You'll kill him!  Jim!

Do you want to kill your father?

You monsters start home.  We're

going to--

MOOSE

Yeah.  Yeah.

MOOSE'S FATHER

We're following you so better get

there.

CRUNCH

You see any cops?

MOOSE

No--

CRUNCH

He's going to cheese, I tell you.

Nobody arrested him!

MOOSE

I think I should go home.

CRUNCH

No.  We're going to bring him down.

Excuse me--but--You know where I

his last name--

SERGEANT

Look--can't you see I'm writing?

HOODLUM

Man, this cat never stops.  He just

keeps going like Big Jay at a session!

OFFICER

Shut up.

HOODLUM

He's writing a book about me--

SERGEANT

What I could write about you they

wouldn't print.

JIM

I think his first name's Ray--I

have to see him.  It's very important.

SERGEANT

What's the charge?

OFFICER

Assault with a deadly weapon.

JIM

Listen--

SERGEANT

(annoyed)

He's not here.  He's not at

Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where

he is.  He's out on a call and

he'll be out all night.  How old

are you?

JIM

My parents know I'm out.  They know

I'm here.

SERGEANT

Come back tomorrow.

JIM

I'll wait for him.

SERGEANT

Why don't you come back tomorrow,

Never heard of you.

They'll be looking for you.

JIM

They saw where I jumped!  I didn't

kill myself?

JUDY

It doesn't matter to them.

JIM

You were looking for me, weren't you?

JUDY

(a small voice)

No--I was just--maybe--

JIM

I tried to call you before.

JUDY

I thought so.

JIM

Want some milk?

JIM

That's all I can do when I'm

nervous.  Drink milk.  Here--have a

slug.

You still pretty upset?

JUDY

I'm numb.

JIM

You cold?

JUDY

Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold.

I guess just about everybody's cold.

I swear, sometimes, you just want

to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what

am I going to do?  I can't go home

again.

JUDY

Neither can I.

JIM

No?  Why not?

(no answer)

You know something?  Sometimes I

figure I'll never live to see my

next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?

JUDY

No.

JIM

Every day I look in the mirror and

say, "What?  You still here?" Man!

JIM

Hey!  You smiled!

JIM

Like even today.  I woke up this

morning, you know?  And the sun was

shining and everything was nice.

Then the first thing that happens

is I see you and I thought this is

going to be one terrific day so you

better live it up, boy, 'cause

tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.

JUDY

I'm sorry I treated you mean today.

You shouldn't believe what I say

when I'm with the kids.  Nobody

acts sincere.

JIM

Why'd you get mixed up with them?

You don't have to prove anything.

JUDY

If you knew me you wouldn't say that.

JIM

I don't think you trust anybody, do

you?

JUDY

Why?

JIM

I'm getting that way, too.

JUDY

(looks at him)

Have you ever gone with anyone who--

JIM

Sure.  Lots of times.

JUDY

So have I.  But I've never been in

love.  Isn't that awful?

JIM

(smiling)

Awful?  No.  It's just lonely.

It's the loneliest time.

JUDY

Why did you do that?

JIM

I felt like it.

JUDY

Your lips are soft when you kiss.

JIM

Where you going?

JUDY

I don't know, but we can't stay here.

JIM

Where can we go?  I can't go back

into that zoo.

JUDY

I'm never going back.

JIM

Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO

mansion near the planetarium

Hey where'd you go?

Wow!  Well now-there-then!

PLATO

Isn't it crazy?

JIM

Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for

the summer.

JUDY

Oh, Jim!

JIM

No--come on.  Should we rent or are

we in a buying mood, dear?

JUDY

(laughing)

You decide, darling.  Remember our

budget.

PLATO

Don't give it a thought.  Only

three million dollars a month!

JUDY

Oh, we can manage that!  I'll

scrimp and save and work my fingers

to the bone...

JIM

Why don't we just rent it for the

season?

JUDY

You see, we've just--oh, you tell

him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I

could die!

JIM

Well--we're newlyweds.

JUDY

There's just one thing.  What about--

PLATO

Children?  Well, we really don't

encourage them.  They're so noisy

and troublesome, don't you agree?

JUDY

Yes.  And so terribly annoying when

they cry.  I just don't know what

to do when they cry, do you dear?

JIM

Of course.  Drown them like puppies.

JUDY

See, we're very modern.

PLATO

Shall I show you the nursery?  It's

far away from the rest of the house.

If you have children--Oh I hate the

word!--or if you decide to adopt

one--they can carry on and you'll

never even notice.  In fact, if you

lock them in you never have to see

them again, much less talk to them.

JUDY

Talk to them!  Heavens!

JIM

Nobody talks to children!  They

just tell them one thing and mean

another.

PLATO

It's wonderful that you understand

so well--and so young too!  You

know the most wonderful feature

about the nursery?

What?

There's only one key.

PLATO

Haven't you noticed your personality

splitting?

JIM

Not lately.

JIM

How do you know so much about this

junk, Plato?

PLATO

I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I

only went twice though.  My mother

said it cost too much, so she went

to Hawaii instead.

JIM

No.  Seriously.  What's your trouble?

PLATO

I don't know but whatever it is,

it's gone now.  I mean I'm happy

now.  Here.

PLATO

I came here before.

JIM

When was that?

PLATO

When I was here?  When I ran away.

I used to run away a lot but they

always took me back.

JIM

Who?

PLATO

Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my

crib and I'd listen to them fight.

JIM

You remember that far back?  Boy, I

can't even remember yesterday.

JUDY

Plato, where's your father now?

PLATO

He's dead.  He was a hero in the

China Sea.

JIM

You told me he's a big wheel in New

York!

PLATO

I did?  Well, he might as well be

dead.  What's the difference?

JUDY

It's all right.

JIM

Sure.

JIM

(continuing)

You have a long life-line.

JUDY

So have you.

JIM

Ever been in a place like this before?

JUDY

Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.

JIM

How many rooms do you think there are?

JUDY

I don't know.

JIM

Should we explore?

DISSOLVE TO:

JIM

Hey!  Will you look at this room!

(looks behind him)

Judy?

JIM

(continuing)

Want to read any books?  Take your

pick!

(sits beside her)

Isn't this the craziest?

JUDY

Hi.

JIM

Hi.

JIM

(continuing)

What?

JUDY

Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.

(kisses it)

You're so funny.

JIM

Why?

JUDY

I don't know--you just are.

Leaving a light for Plato.  That

was nice.

JIM

Maybe he's scared of the dark.

JUDY

Are you?

JIM

(singing)

Here we are--

out of cigarettes--

Junior's in the nurs'ry--

See how late it gets--

JUDY

You don't need to do that.

JIM

There's something I should tell

you, Judy.

JUDY

I know already.  We don't have to

pretend now.

JIM

(laughing)

What a relief!

JUDY

Is this what it's like to love

somebody?

JIM

You disappointed?

JUDY

(mussing her hair)

Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and

you--this is silly.

JIM

What?

JUDY

You smell like baby powder.

JIM

So do you.

JUDY

I never felt so clean before.

JIM

It's not going to be lonely, Judy.

Not for you and not for me.

JUDY

I love somebody.  All the time I've

been looking for someone to love me

and now--I love somebody.  And it's

so easy.  Why is it easy now?

JIM

It is for me too.

JUDY

I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.

JIM

I mean it too.

GOON

What you stopping for?

CRUNCH

You scam a car up there?

MOTHER

So what?

CRUNCH

Nobody's lived in that hunk of junk

for five-six years.

CRUNCH

Well, what do you know!  I feel a

kick coming on!

OFFICER

This is Unit 17.  Unit 17.

RADIO

Come in, Unit 17.

OFFICER

We just zeroed three kids in a heap.

Crest Drive and Observatory.  Looks

like house-breaking.  Send us some

help.  They may be armed.  Over.

CRUNCH

Good morning.

CRUNCH

Moose!  Take the steps!  Goon!  The

other side.

CRUNCH

Come on!  Let's make it!

PLATO

Save me!

PLATO

(shrieks)

What you run out on me for!  What

you leave me alone for?

JIM

Plato!

PLATO

(with hate)

I don't want you for my father!

JIM

Your father!

JIM

(in rage)

You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!

PLATO

(screaming)

Get away from me!

JUDY

Jim!

OFFICER

(sharply)

Halt!

OFFICER

(continuing)

Come here.

JIM

Plato!

OFFICER (O.S.)

Come here, son.

PLATO

No!

JIM (O.S.)

Plato!

OFFICER (O.S.)

Just walk over here quietly now--

and there won't be any trouble.

JIM

Plato!

JUDY

Jim!  Watch out!

FIRST OFFICER

Take the house!  I'll head him off.

OFFICER (O.S.)

Halt!  Halt!

RADIO

--located at Summit Drive--the

Planetarium.

RAY

(snapping on mike)

The planetarium?  One kid inside--

five housebreaking in area.  Will

proceed.

(turning to JIM's parents)

There are some kids in trouble--

you'll have to go with me.

FATHER

Perfectly all right.

JIM

(yelling)

Plato!

JIM (O.S.)

(distant)

Plato!

JUDY

Did he hit you?

JIM

No!

JUDY

We have to go back!

JIM

No!  I got to find him.

JUDY

After he tried to shoot you?

JIM

He didn't mean it--we shouldn't

have left him.  He needed us.

JUDY

He needed you, maybe.  So do I.

JIM

He needs you too.  Come on.

JUDY

You should have heard him talk

about you tonight.  Like you were

the hero in the China Seas.

JIM

Sure.  He was trying to make us his

family.

JUDY

They're killing him!

OFFICER (O.S.)

Come out of there.

OFFICER

You're making it tough on yourself,

kid.  Come out quietly now.  You

didn't kill anybody yet.

OFFICER

(running)

Need a little help here!

CHIEF

We heard firing.  He get anybody?

You alone?

OFFICER

We got a cookaboo inside.  He

wounded some kid earlier.

CHIEF

How'd he get in?

OFFICER

Smashed the front door.

CHIEF

Any other entrance?

OFFICER

(leaving)

Down in back.

CHIEF

(loud on speaker)

Silence.  Please maintain silence.

Keep back and stay off the

pavements.  Keep back and stay off

the pavements.  There will be

emergency vehicles coming through.

This warning is for your own

protection.

NEGRO WOMAN

What's going on?

OFFICER

I don't know, lady.  Some kid's in

trouble.  Stand back, please.

NEGRO WOMAN

I got to know.  My boy run off

tonight.  He had a gun with him, too.

CHIEF

Hello, Ray--Know anything about this?

RAY

As much as you do--Loan me your

mike, will you?

CHIEF

(handing it to him)

Help yourself.

RAY

(into mike)

I am addressing the boy in the

planetarium.  I am speaking to the

boy inside.  This is Ray Framek

from the Juvenile Division--

RAY (O.S.)

(over speaker)

You are now surrounded.  You are

surrounded by many armed police.

Whoever you are, drop your weapon

and come outside.

RAY (O.S.)

(over speaker)

Come outside.  Clasp your hands

over your head and come outside

quietly--

MOTHER

Frank!

FATHER

Stay here.

(goes over to RAY)

That was my son!

RAY

You sure?

FATHER

I think I know my son.

RAY (O.S.)

(over speaker)

Jim Stark!  I'm addressing Jim

Stark.  Nobody will harm you or

your friends if you follow these

instructions.  We are here to

protect you.  Drop your guns and

come outside.  Nobody will hurt you

if you do as I say--

CHIEF

Officers!  Another boy and girl

just ran into the planetarium.  We

do not know if they are armed.

Hold your positions until further

instruction.

CHIEF (O.S.)

(over speaker)

Ambulance.  Ambulance is coming

through.  Clear a passage.  Will

you people make way there?

JIM

(softly)

Plato?

JIM

(continuing - calling softly)

Plato?  Plato, you in there?

(silence)

Hey, I'm going to open the door now.

You'll be able to see me and you

can shoot me if you want, but just

remember one thing, Plato--You're

my friend.  That means a lot to me.

JIM

Plato?

PLATO

I'm here.

JIM

Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a

match?  I'm going to break my neck

in here.  Where are you?

PLATO

I've got a gun.

JIM

I know.  Light a match, will you?

JIM

That's swell.  How are you?

PLATO

I'm fine.

PLATO

You think the end of the world will

come at nighttime, Jim?

JIM

No.  At dawn.

PLATO

Why?

JIM

I just have a feeling.  Where are you?

PLATO

Here.

JIM

Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I

can't talk to you if I don't see you.

JIM

Hey, look at the stars, Plato.

Stand up and look at the stars.

JIM

That's fine.

JIM

I'm not going to hurt you.

PLATO

Why did you run out on me?

JIM

We didn't run out.  We were coming

right back.

PLATO

You sure?

JIM

Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting.

You ready to come out now?

PLATO

No.

JIM

I promise nothing'll happen if you

do.

(silence)

You want my jacket?  It's warm.

PLATO

Can I keep it?

JIM

What do you think?

JIM

You want to give me your gun now,

Plato?

PLATO

My gun?

JIM

In your pocket.  Give it to me.

PLATO

I need it.

JIM

You trust me, don't you?  Just give

it to me for a second.

PLATO

You promised to give it back.

JIM

Friends never break promises, do

they?

(gives him back the gun)

Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There

are a lot of people outside and

they all want you to be safe.  You

understand that?  They said I could

come in and bring you out.

PLATO

Why?

JIM

They like you.  Okay?

PLATO

Come on!

JUDY

Hi, Plato!

PLATO

Hi.

PLATO

Who's that?

JIM

Just a guard.

PLATO

I shot at one of them.

JIM

But you didn't hurt anybody.

PLATO

Those aren't my friends.  Make them

go away.

JIM

(tense; calling past camera)

Ray!  Will you tell these guys to

move back?

JIM

(yelling)

Plato!  Don't be a fool!

MOTHER

It's Jim!

JIM

Plato!

PLATO

Keep away from me!  I don't believe

you anymore!

JIM

(screaming--wildly)

But I've got the bullets!  The gun

was empty!

JIM

Plato?

(crouches over PLATO)

Plato.  Hey, Jerkpot!

JIM

(quiet)

What did you have to do that for?

FATHER

Let him alone!  He's mine!  I'll

take care of him!

RAY

It's all right!  It's all right!

FATHER

For a minute...that jacket...I

thought...

(breaks off, then)

You couldn't help it, son.

(reaches out, gently,

but firmly)

You did everything a man could do.

FATHER

Stand up, Jim.  I'll stand up with

you.  Let me try to be as strong as

you want me to be.

JIM

He depended on me.

FATHER

And you can depend on me, son.

Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll

face it together, I swear.

NEGRO WOMAN

(as they lift PLATO

onto litter)

This poor baby got nobody.  Just

nobody.

JIM

(to JUDY, half to himself)

He was always cold.

JIM

Mom--Dad--this is my friend.  Her

name is Judy.

FADE OUT.

The end.
