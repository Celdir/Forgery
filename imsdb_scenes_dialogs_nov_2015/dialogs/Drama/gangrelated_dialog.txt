SHOOTING DRAFT

1997

DIVINCI

Says here they got slips in Honolulu.

325 a month. Utilities included.

That's not bad.

DIVINCI

But I gotta get at least a forty

footer. It'll handle rough water

better and I'll need the room if I'm

gonna live on it.

RODRIGUEZ

I don't know how you do it.

DIVINCI

What?

RODRIGUEZ

How you can think about Hawaii now?

DIVINCI

My heart's in Hawaii.

RODRIGUEZ

You never been there. How can your

heart be there.

DIVINCI

You're tellin' me there's no place

you'd rather be other than here?

RODRIGUEZ

No, I'm saying I just don't know how

you can think about Hawaii right

now.

DIVINCI

If I was in Hawaii right now, I

wouldn't be thinking about here. See

the difference?

RODRIGUEZ

No.

DIVINCI

Look, I'm not in Hawaii, I'm here.

But I don't want to be here, I want

to be in Hawaii. I can't be in Hawaii,

therefore I think about it so as to

not get depressed about being here.

RODRIGUEZ

But I'm here, I know I'm here, I

don't like being here, but I can't

be anyplace else because I look around

and I see all this shit. How do you

get around that?! That's what I'm

asking.

DIVINCI

Focus.

RODRIGUEZ

Focus.

RODRIGUEZ

It's time. No more Hawaii, okay?

Focus on this.

DIVINCI

(smiles)

Aloha.

RODRIGUEZ

(to himself)

Aloha my ass.

CUT TO:

CYNTHIA

Left at the corner.

DIVINCI

Hope you don't mind me checkin' you

for weapons.

HUDD

Hell yes I mind.

HUDD

I just don't want no man handlin'

me.

DIVINCI

Okay. Check him.

HUDD

Lotta good hidin' places on this

body. Check good.

HUDD

Careful. It's loaded.

CYNTHIA

He's got nothin'.

HUDD

Not bad, not bad. Any more where

this came from?

DIVINCI

Maybe.

HUDD

Then maybe we talk again.

DIVINCI

Maybe.

HUDD

Told you there was a lotta good hidin'

places on this body.

HUDD

Bet you gotta lotta nice hidin'

places, too.

RODRIGUEZ

Come on! Hurry up!

CUT TO:

CYNTHIA

Hey, Joe, wake up. Get outa the street

before you get run over. Joe, wake

up!

CYNTHIA

You're in the street, Joe. Get outa

the street.

CYNTHIA

Other way, Joe.

CYNTHIA

Forget it, Joe. Maybe you're better

off right there. I don't think you'd

even feel it.

CUT TO:

CYNTHIA

Who is it?

DIVINCI

Got your money.

CYNTHIA

Put it on the table.

DIVINCI

Tired?

CYNTHIA

Yes.

DIVINCI

I'm not.

CYNTHIA

Take a sleeping pill. There's some

in my purse.

DIVINCI

You want your money?

CYNTHIA

I already worked for that.

DIVINCI

This is a bonus.

CYNTHIA

For who?

DIVINCI

This ain't my fault. This is a failure

of our educational system. If you

hadn't fallen through the cracks and

dropped outa school, you wouldn't be

here now.

CYNTHIA

So what's your excuse?

DIVINCI

I'm in love.

CUT TO:

VIC

Keepin' some late hours.

RODRIGUEZ

What the hell you doin'? What're my

neighbors gonna think?

VIC

I apologize. I understand your

concerns. But you must understand

that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely

on a late fee as sufficient

encouragement to repay one's debts.

I am forced to employ the likes of

Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might

add, contributes significantly to my

overhead. I am the real loser here.

And I am concerned about your

sincerity in repaying the twenty-

seven thousand, nine hundred forty-

two dollar gambling debt that is one

week past due. What can you do to

reassure me of your good intentions?

RODRIGUEZ

I can make your life fuckin' miserable

that's what I can do.

VIC

Look at me. Do I have a wife and

three kids? Do I have a good job at

IBM? Am I a handsome guy? No, no and

no. I loan money at excessively high

interest rates to pricks like you

who can't control their urges to

lose big money playing cards and

then I am forced to stay up all night

trying to convince them that I have

needs, too. The point of which is, I

already have a fuckin' miserable

life. So don't threaten me you lousy

bag of cat shit.

VIC

All I'm askin' is that you be

responsible. Is that unreasonable?

RODRIGUEZ

Four thousand is all I got.

VIC

I am proportionally reassured. You

purchased yourself an extension.

RODRIGUEZ

Cutless Supreme, what kind of fuckin'

idiot name is that?

CUTLESS SUPREME

It was the car my daddy stole to

take my momma to the hospital, but

the cops stopped him and shot him

dead in an alley before he could

explain. I was born in the back seat.

CUT TO:

PATROLMAN MAHONEY

Another day, another body. Where you

wanna start?

FIRST MAN

A hit?

PATROLMAN MAHONEY

Looks like. Could be gang related.

PATROLMAN MAHONEY

Happened sometime last night, early

morning, two, three o'clock. African-

American male, looks like in his

thirties. But even that's a guess.

Half his head is on the upholstery.

RODRIGUEZ

Any witnesses?

PATROLMAN MAHONEY

Oh, sure, hundreds.

DIVINCI

Fuckin' Animals.

CUT TO:

FIRST DETECTIVE

...three shotgun shells, twelve gauge.

DESK OFFICER

Three shotgun shells, twelve gauge.

SECOND DETECTIVE (SGT. GARDNER)

Heard you got a gang related. Lucky

guy, Divinci. You get all the pretty

ones.

DIVINCI

One less drug store on the street.

DESK OFFICER

And the world is a safer place.

CUT TO:

RODRIGUEZ

(into phone)

-- a green car... you know what

make... Maybe a Ford, uh-huh. You

didn't see the license, did you?

RODRIGUEZ

(into phone)

Yeah, no, I understand, it was dark...

Uh-huh.

DIVINCI

Wanna go for a ride?

RODRIGUEZ

(into phone)

You think you could describe the

driver?

(covers phone; to

Divinci)

You bought it?

DIVINCI

As of last night, I've got the down.

Just picture me under swayin' palms

with a Mai Tai.

RODRIGUEZ

(into phone)

Uh-huh.

(covers phone)

You're gonna buy it, no shit. When?

DIVINCI

Just a phone call away.

RODRIGUEZ

That's really great, man.

RODRIGUEZ

(back to phone)

Uh-huh, okay... how tall was he?

CAPT. HENDERSON

You got primary on the drug related

this morning on 27th.

DIVINCI

I'm workin' it up now.

CAPT. HENDERSON

Who's your second?

(Divinci points at

Rodriguez)

In my office. Both of you.

DIVINCI

Why?

CAPT. HENDERSON

Now.

RODRIGUEZ

What the hell --

CAPT. HENDERSON

Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez,

this is Richard Simms. He's with the

D.E.A. He wants to ask you some

questions about your case.

DIVINCI

What's the occasion?

SIMMS

You get an i.d. on the victim?

RODRIGUEZ

We're waitin' for prints.

DIVINCI

Car was registered to --

SIMMS

-- Anchor Imports. 81 El Dorado.

Black.

DIVINCI

If you got all this, what d'you want

from us?

SIMMS

...The man in the car is Lionel Hudd.

RODRIGUEZ

(a little incensed)

How d'you know that?

(to Henderson)

What's goin' on here?

SIMMS

Hudd was DEA, undercover.

SIMMS (O.S.)

He was workin' a case on syndicate

distribution of drugs on the south

side. But every dealer we tagged

kept getting killed. He finally got

a lead on a girl -- Hudd was a friend

of mine... I'm gonna nail the

sonuvabitch who killed him.

DIVINCI

We'll do everything we can to help.

CUT TO:

RODRIGUEZ

SHIT, FUCK, SHIT, JESUS CHRIST!

DIVINCI

Calm down!

RODRIGUEZ

WE'RE DEAD, WE'RE FUCKING DEAD!

DIVINCI

SHUT UP!

RODRIGUEZ

FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!

DIVINCI

STOP IT! YOU HEAR ME, RIGHT NOW,

STOP IT!

RODRIGUEZ

GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT

OF CONTROL!

RODRIGUEZ

LET GO OF ME!

DIVINCI

Shut up and listen to me!

DIVINCI

They could be watchin' us right now

you asshole. So fuckin' shape up!

You got it?!

(nothing from Rodriguez)

I want you to nod!

DIVINCI

Get the fuck up!

DIVINCI

Get in the car!

DIVINCI

There's no fuckin' reason to panic.

RODRIGUEZ

No fuckin' reason to panic? Did you

say no fuckin' reason to panic!

DIVINCI

Stop being an idiot! We're the cops

on the case. It's our case. We are

going to find the fuckin' killers.

RODRIGUEZ

WE'RE THE FUCKIN' KILLERS!

DIVINCI

Since when does that matter?!

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

All they want is someone to go down

for the crime, right? Do we care who

goes down for the crime? Fuck no. As

long as someone goes down for the

crime. It's a slot that's gotta be

filled.

RODRIGUEZ

We killed a cop, doesn't that bother

you?

DIVINCI

Of course it bothers me. What d'you

want me to do, turn myself in? Well

I'm not. That's the risk we take

everyday, somebody might pop us,

especially undercover like that. So

he got popped. It happens.

RODRIGUEZ

Not by other cops!

DIVINCI

I patted him down! He wasn't wearin'

a wire, he had no badge, no gun, how

was I supposed to know?!

DIVINCI

Look, I feel just as bad as you do,

but we gotta start thinkin' about us

here. The important thing is we don't

lose control of the case. We can

never lose control of the case.

Whatever evidence there is goes

through us. We lay down the trail.

Make it nice and logical. We're the

teachers and two and two can add up

to five if it's our classroom.

RODRIGUEZ

What're you talkin' about, are you

sayin' we stick somebody with this?

DIVINCI

Evidence points wherever we want it

to point. Shit, we can provide so

much evidence, even the asshole we

pick will think he fuckin' killed

him.

RODRIGUEZ

You got some asshole in mind?

DIVINCI

Just don't worry. We'll find a killer.

There's lots of 'em out there.

CUT TO:

JAMES

What the hell'd I do now?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JAMES

Ain't my gun.

DIVINCI

Never is, is it.

JAMES

That ain't my fuckin' gun.

DIVINCI

Got your fuckin' prints on it.

RODRIGUEZ

Where were you Friday night?

JAMES

Friday night... last Friday night?

RODRIGUEZ

Where were you?

JAMES

Whatever you think I did went down

last Friday night?

DIVINCI

Better have a good alibi, James, or

it's good ali bye-bye.

JAMES

I was in jail you assholes. Check it

out.

(starts to laugh)

All night. What a couple a dickheads!

CUT TO:

DIVINCI AND RODRIGUEZ

NOBODY MOVE! HANDS IN THE AIR! NOW!

MOVE IT!

CORTEZ

Ain't my gun.

RODRIGUEZ

(smiles)

Got your prints on it.

CORTEZ

(stands; angry)

You fuck, I ain't never seen that

gun before!

RODRIGUEZ

Where were you last Friday night?

CORTEZ

Fuck you. I wanna talk to a lawyer!

RODRIGUEZ

Lawyer's not gonna help you, Cortez.

All the evidence we got points right

to you.

CORTEZ

Did you say last Friday night?

CORTEZ

Intensive Care, you pindejo fuckin'

gutter shits. And Thursday night,

and Saturday, too. I just fucking

got out this morning.

CUT TO:

DAVE

Alright, alright, alright... shit. I

ain't gonna fight you.

CUT TO:

DAVE

Ain't my gun.

RODRIGUEZ

That's what they all say.

DAVE

Wish it was. No better gun than Smitty

and Wes .44 mag with serial numbers

filed off.

(opens cylinder)

Got any bullets?

DAVE

Who did I kill?

DIVINCI

Where were you last Friday night?

DAVE

You mean, what's my alibi right?

DAVE

I was breakin' and entering. Jewelry

store on seventh and Front, about

nine o'clock. Not even close to your

jurisdiction. I got the rocks to

prove it.

DAVE

Sorry I can't help ya. But one to

five is better than ten to life.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

Montrose LaJolla...

RODRIGUEZ

We pulled him in last year for knifing

that dealer on 32nd.

DIVINCI

Yeah. Almost killed him, remember?

He'd be good.

(calls out to ANOTHER

DETECTIVE)

Anybody seen Montrose LaJolla?

ANOTHER DETECTIVE

He's dead. His life partner killed

him in a Domestic D about a month

ago.

RODRIGUEZ

Shit!

DIVINCI

Take it easy.

RODRIGUEZ

This isn't gonna work!

DIVINCI

Nobody said it was gonna be easy.

But let's not advertise our despair...

Okay?

DIVINCI

(into phone)

Divinci.

DIVINCI

This is our case! Not the goddamn

DEA's!

CAPT. HENDERSON

It's been three days.

DIVINCI

We're not fuckin' magicians! What

the hell is three days?! This is a

goddamn murder case! It takes a little

bit of goddamn time!

CAPT. HENDERSON

When a Federal Undercover Officer

goes down, it's never a fuckin' murder

case! I don't like the DEA on my ass

any better than you like 'em on yours.

But this is personal for them and

they want answers. Forget your other

cases and get something, anything

that I can give to them. The last

thing I want is the goddamn F.B.I.

on my back, too.

DIVINCI

We've got a couple leads. We need a

little more time.

CAPT. HENDERSON

I can't hold 'em off much longer.

RODRIGUEZ

This is no fuckin' way to run an

investigation.

CAPT. HENDERSON

Let me tell you both something, if

you don't solve this quick, they're

gonna start askin' why? And they'll

be lookin' to blame somebody in this

department. So my advise to you is,

get something fuckin' fast or turn

over what you've got and get outa

the way.

DIVINCI

How much time we got?

CAPT. HENDERSON

A couple days. The funeral's this

afternoon.

RODRIGUEZ

What funeral?

CAPT. HENDERSON

For Agent Hudd. Simms wants you there.

DIVINCI

What for? We didn't know him.

CAPT. HENDERSON

How the hell do I know?! It's DEA,

it's their thing. You're the cops on

the case, I suppose they want you to

know what a great guy Hudd was so

you'll work all that harder to find

his killer. Just go. It'll reassure

'em how much you care and keep 'em

off my ass.

CUT TO:

REVEREND

-- and it is too easy to say that he

was a good man in his job because he

gave more than most. And it's too

easy to say that he was a good man

in his community because he gave

more than others. And it's too easy

to say he was a good man at home

with his family because he was always

there when they needed him. Special

Agent Lionel Hudd was not just a

good man, he was an extraordinary

man. And his death shall not be in

vain.

DIVINCI

Don't Humpty Dumpty on me.

RODRIGUEZ

What's that mean?

DIVINCI

Your cracks are startin' to show.

RODRIGUEZ

(covering)

Bullshit.

DIVINCI

Get your balance. Here comes the

King.

SIMMS

Glad you came... Anything break?

DIVINCI

Nothin' to brag about. But we've got

a couple new leads we're followin'.

SIMMS

...Look, normally we'd be all over

this, but your Captain seems to think

you can do the job. It's your

territory. I guess you know it better

than anybody. And that can be worth

a lot. But you understand... we won't

wait forever.

DIVINCI

Just outa curiosity... What happened

to his backup? You guys use backup

on undercover don't you?

SIMMS

It was a new lead. Hudd was afraid

backup would blow his cover. He was

supposed to check in ten minutes

after the deal went down. He never

checked in.

RODRIGUEZ

We want this one as bad as you do. A

cop's a cop. We're in this together,

right?

SIMMS

That's why I asked you to come here.

Just so you knew that.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

He didn't have backup. You believe

that?! Jesus what a dick.

RODRIGUEZ

I don't think we should criticize

that particular decision of his.

DIVINCI

I don't care what the reasons are,

you don't play Lone Fuckin' Ranger

on a drug buy. You're just askin'

for it. That's all I'm sayin'.

RODRIGUEZ

I don't trust those bastards. They're

not waitin' for us. That's bullshit.

They're runnin' their own

investigation. I know it!

DIVINCI

Let 'em. The gun, the coke came from

evidence. The car came from impound.

So what's to find?

RODRIGUEZ

That's what I'm afraid of. There's

nothing for them to find. We were

too good.

DIVINCI

So what're you worried about?

RODRIGUEZ

Nobody is that fuckin' good.

DIVINCI

Except us.

CUT TO:

CYNTHIA

I think this is breaking and entering,

isn't it?

DIVINCI

I work homicide, I don't deal with

that shit.

CYNTHIA

(puts on robe)

Learn anything you didn't already

have on file?

DIVINCI

Yeah. You surprise me sometimes.

Here I think you're just a hard case

and I discover you've got a heart of

gold.

(holds up her drivers

license)

You're an organ donor. That's really

nice. The only problem is, they'll

never use your best parts.

CYNTHIA

I'll make sure you get them.

DIVINCI

Hey, don't get me wrong. I was just

surprised that we had something in

common... Besides what we have in

common.

CYNTHIA

Do everybody a favor, if you're gonna

donate your heart, make sure it goes

to science. Most people want one

that beats.

DIVINCI

Cynthia... pretty name. What do the

first three letters spell?

CYNTHIA

Don't get so clever. It's out of

character.

CUT TO:

CYNTHIA

What's so interesting up there?

DIVINCI

Nothing.

CYNTHIA

Then why's it got all your attention?

DIVINCI

I'm thinkin', that's all.

CYNTHIA

About us?

DIVINCI

No.

CYNTHIA

Good.

DIVINCI

What if I was thinkin' about us?

CYNTHIA

Don't waste your time.

DIVINCI

What if I was?

CYNTHIA

Where's it gonna get us?

DIVINCI

Maybe I got plans.

CYNTHIA

I don't wanna hear 'em. Plans just

make you think somethin's gonna get

better. I'm fine now. I don't need

to get screwed up waitin' for

something good to happen.

DIVINCI

I just want you to know, love is

important to me.

CYNTHIA

Me, too.

DIVINCI

But more important is loyalty. Nothing

is more important than that. Not

love, not anything. Because loyalty

is about respect. You can talk about

love all you want, but without respect

it's empty. I mean the first thing

that goes in a marriage is respect.

And once it's gone, forget the love.

So I am telling you, I am loyal to

you. Like I'm loyal to my partner.

We are closer than blood. And I trust

him with my life.

CYNTHIA

Why're you telling me this?

DIVINCI

When you asked if I was thinkin'

about us and I said I wasn't, I just

want you to know that I do.

CYNTHIA

Just don't ask me to marry you.

DIVINCI

(smiles)

Why aren't more women like you?

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

(lowers gun)

You fuckin' idiot.

DIVINCI

What've we got here?

DIVINCI

Where were you last Friday night?

CUT TO:

DIVINCI'S VOICE

What's your name?

DIVINCI

Your name, what's your name?

WILLIAM

...Joe...

DIVINCI

Where'd you get the gun, Joe?

DIVINCI

It was in your pocket, Joe, your

coat pocket. You must keep it for

protection, right?

WILLIAM

I don't know.

DIVINCI

Sure you do, Joe. Everybody needs

protection. Especially a guy like

you lives on the street, right?

DIVINCI

Put it back in your pocket, Joe. You

don't have to worry about me, I'm

not gonna hurt you.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

Wake up, Joe! I want you to look at

something. Out the window, Joe. Look

out the window.

DIVINCI

This is where it happened, Joe. I

want you to remember it. This is

where you killed him

DIVINCI

You remember it now? How you shot

him through the head? You remember

it?

WILLIAM

I... don't...

DIVINCI

(lets go of Joe)

You will.

CUT TO:

RODRIGUEZ

Who the hell is this?

DIVINCI

Is that any way to answer the phone?

RODRIGUEZ

Divinci, shit! It's quarter to six.

DIVINCI

I know what time it is, I'm not the

one in bed. I need the photos of the

scene.

RODRIGUEZ

Now?

DIVINCI

I got a suspect. But he can't remember

all the details. He needs a little

help. And I thought, since you're my

partner, you might jump at the

opportunity to lend me a fuckin'

hand.

RODRIGUEZ

He doesn't remember last Friday?

DIVINCI

He doesn't remember a lotta Fridays.

Bring the shots and pick up a fifth

of Vodka.

(glances at Joe)

Make it two.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

Time to get up, Joe.

DIVINCI

I want you to look at something.

DIVINCI

There's the guy and the street and

the car. You remember how you shot

him.

DIVINCI

You don't remember? That's not what

you told me last night.

DIVINCI

If you remember you can have a drink.

DIVINCI

But you gotta remember how you saw

him driving toward you and you were

in the street and you were afraid he

was going to hit you so you had to

shoot to protect yourself. You

remember now don't you?

DIVINCI

And where's your gun, Joe, where do

you keep your gun?

DISSOLVE TO:

RODRIGUEZ

Why'd you kill him?

WILLIAM

I... don't know...

RODRIGUEZ

It was your gun.

WILLIAM

...I don't have a gun.

DIVINCI

Yes you do. In your pocket.

WILLIAM

...I'm tired.

DIVINCI

I know, Joe, it's tough to remember

things you don't wanna remember.

What about your last name, Joe. You

got a last name?

RODRIGUEZ

Come on, Joe, everybody's got a last

name.

WILLIAM

I don't remember.

RODRIGUEZ

Don't fuck with us, Joe. We're trying

to help you. What's your last goddamn

name?

WILLIAM

I don't know.

DIVINCI

(to Joe; friendly)

Come on, we're all tired here, Joe.

Just give us your last name.

WILLIAM

I don't remember.

DIVINCI

...Okay, fine, what's in a name? But

you remember the gun, right, in your

pocket.

DIVINCI

And you remember that you told me

you thought he was going to hit you,

right? That's why you shot...

WILLIAM

...Yeah.

DIVINCI

How'd it happen, Joe, tell me how it

happened.

(prompting)

You saw him driving toward you --

WILLIAM

-- I saw him driving toward me --

CUT TO:

RODRIGUEZ

Then what did you do?

DIVINCI

You ran.

JOE'S VOICE

I didn't mean to...

WILLIAM

He was going to hit me... I was

scared... he was going to hit me.

DIVINCI

That's why you shot him.

WILLIAM

That's why I...

JOE'S VOICE

...shot him.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

Helluva nice shot, Joe.

CUT TO:

CYNTHIA

It's the middle of the day.

DIVINCI

Just talk.

CYNTHIA

Since when?

DIVINCI

I need you to do something.

CYNTHIA

Good, I need the money.

DIVINCI

This isn't a deal. Where you goin'?

CYNTHIA

I got perishables, okay?

DIVINCI

The guy we did the last deal with is

dead.

CYNTHIA

What?

DIVINCI

Somebody popped him that night,

probably when he tried to unload the

stuff. I don't know.

CYNTHIA

Jesus, does anybody --

DIVINCI

-- Don't worry, there's no connection.

We got the guy who did it.

CYNTHIA

You scared the hell outa me.

DIVINCI

We just need you to do one thing.

CYNTHIA

...What?

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

He'll be third from the left. Don't

fuck up. Third from the left.

CYNTHIA

What'm I supposed to say?

DIVINCI

Just look at 'em and then look at

the man the third from the left and

say, It's him.

RODRIGUEZ

And I'll say, Are you sure?

DIVINCI

And you say, Absolutely. No question.

CYNTHIA

This is all I need to do right?

DIVINCI

We have a signed confession. You

i.d. him, he's goin' straight into

the can.

CYNTHIA

Okay, okay. But this is it. I'm not

doin' anything more than this.

DIVINCI

Hey, it's a done deal.

CUT TO:

A VOICE

Stop and face front.

THE VOICE

Lift your heads, look straight.

DIVINCI

Take your time. Try and remember his

face.

CYNTHIA

I know him.

DIVINCI

If you can identify the man --

CYNTHIA

(whisper)

I know him.

DIVINCI

Just tell us which one.

CYNTHIA

No. I fucking know him.

RODRIGUEZ

What's the problem?

DIVINCI

There's no problem!

(to Cynthia; pointedly)

Do you see him up there?!

CYNTHIA

(aside)

You don't understand.

ONE OF THE MEN

Hey, come on, do it or don't!

THE VOICE

No talking.

DIVINCI

Pick the asshole out!

CYNTHIA

Third man from the left.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

You mind telling me what that was

all about?!

CYNTHIA

I know him. He hangs around my

building. He lives in the alley or

something.

DIVINCI

You don't think people that hang

around your neighborhood can kill

somebody. Well let me tell you

something. You don't live in a great

fuckin' neighborhood.

DIVINCI

Just sign the goddamn paper.

CYNTHIA

What paper?

RODRIGUEZ

You picked a man out of a lineup,

you have to sign that you did that

so they don't think we made it up.

CYNTHIA

Now why the hell would they think

something like that?

DIVINCI

Sign it.

CYNTHIA

You said all I had to do was pick

him out.

DIVINCI

This is part of it. Just sign it and

you're done.

CYNTHIA

How come you're so sure it was him?

RODRIGUEZ

Jesus Christ!

DIVINCI

He confessed.

CYNTHIA

Bullshit.

RODRIGUEZ

We got it in writing.

CYNTHIA

He didn't do it.

DIVINCI

How the hell d'you know that? Were

you with him at the time?! You have

a good goddamn alibi for him?!

RODRIGUEZ

Maybe she was blowing him!

CYNTHIA

Better him than you.

DIVINCI

Take it easy.

RODRIGUEZ

Fine, I got nothin' at stake here.

DIVINCI

This is what they call an open and

shut case. He did the kill and he's

going down. Don't make the mistake

of thinking you know the right thing

to do.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

SIMMS

Doe?

RODRIGUEZ

He wouldn't give us his last name.

SIMMS

He signed a confession but he wouldn't

give you his last name?

DIVINCI

He said he couldn't remember it.

(points to his head)

He's a head case.

AGENT HOOPER

You run prints?

RODRIGUEZ

No priors.

AGENT SARKASIAN

Ballistics match?

RODRIGUEZ

We're waiting. But a forty-four was

used in commission. He had a forty-

four on him.

AGENT HOOPER

It went down pretty quick.

DIVINCI

It's our street.

CAPT. HENDERSON

I think they did a helluva job.

SIMMS

Goddammit!

SIMMS

Some goddamn piece a shit blows him

away for NOTHING!

SIMMS

I'm sorry. Hudd was too good for

this to happen... I just didn't think

he'd go down this way.

SIMMS

Good work. Thanks.

CAPT. HENDERSON

Do me a favor. Make sure this one

sticks. I don't want the D.E.Assholes

back in here.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI'S VOICE (FILTERED)

Cynthia... pretty name. What do the

first three letters spell?

CUT TO:

GUARD

Word is he killed a DEA undercover...

(no response)

Word is he shot him in the face...

(no response)

Word is he signed a confession.

ELLIOT

Word is everyone's entitled to a

defense... no matter how guilty they

are.

ELLIOT

Oh shit.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

He's detoxing. I gave him something

to help him through it.

ELLIOT

Can I talk to him?

ELLIOT

Joe, can you hear me?

ELLIOT

I'm Elliot Goff. I'm your attorney...

Do you understand what I'm saying?

CUT TO:

HELEN

-- when the defendant, Clyde Dunner,

entered the house of George and Carol

Beaman on Friday night, a .44 caliber

pistol in his hand. He entered the

house with one thing in mind. To

kill George and Carol, the people he

blamed for the break up of his

marriage to Carol's sister, Paula.

HELEN

George and Carol were watching a

movie when he entered the living

room and opened fire. George was

killed instantly, hit in the face.

Carol died later of three bullet

wounds to her chest.

HELEN

Then the defendant, in his effort to

cover up the crime, doused them with

lighter fluid and set the house on

fire... Carol was still alive.

HELEN

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury we

will prove to you, beyond any

reasonable doubt, that the defendant,

Clyde David Dunner, is guilty of two

counts of murder in the first degree.

JUDGE WEINBERG

The defense may now proceed.

RICHARD STEIN

-- Jesus Christ!

YOUNG MAN

-- I don't know where?

RICHARD STEIN

Are you sure?

YOUNG MAN

They looked all over --

HELEN

What's wrong?

RICHARD STEIN

They can't find the murder weapon.

HELEN

What're you talking about?

RICHARD STEIN

Dunner's .44. They can't find the

goddamn gun!

YOUNG MAN

They lost it or something. Misplaced

it, I don't know. They can't find it

anywhere.

HELEN

(no whisper this time)

What?!

CUT TO:

HELEN

-- I don't have a goddamn case without

the goddamn gun. His fingerprints,

the ballistics, everything! I have

to have the fucking gun or he's gonna

walk. That murdering piece of filth

will go free without the .44. How

could they lose it?!

CUT TO:

RODRIGUEZ

The Dunner gun, you used the fucking

Dunner gun?!

DIVINCI

This is not my fuck up! Our shooting

was supposed to be gang-related and

unsolved! Only because we tagged a

goddamn undercover cop do we need

the fucking .44 for evidence!

Otherwise, we never woulda needed

it. So don't point your finger at

me!

RODRIGUEZ

Alright, alright... But how are we

supposed to explain how the same gun

was used in two murder cases by two

different killers when it was supposed

to be in police custody?!

DIVINCI

We don't explain it. It's not our

fault they lost the evidence.

Ballistics are already complete in

Dunner's case. All we need is another

gun.

CUT TO:

THE GUN SELLER

All my merchandise is in top

condition. Untraceable. The best

money can buy.

THE GUN SELLER

It's got good knock down, but it's

slow. Unless you have a preference

for revolvers, I suggest a nine

millimeter auto. They are more

expensive, but what they cost in

money, they save in time.

DIVINCI

The .44.

RODRIGUEZ

What?

THE GUN SELLER

You look like police.

THE GUN SELLER

No offense.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ELLIOT

Joe, I'm Elliot, we met the other...

well, you weren't in very good shape.

You look much better.

ELLIOT

Have a chair. We need to talk.

WILLIAM

About what I did.

ELLIOT

Yes.

ELLIOT

Joe, before we get into what happened

that night, I'd like to check a couple

of things first.

(looks at papers)

Joe is your first name, I assume

Joseph?

WILLIAM

Okay.

ELLIOT

What about Doe? Is that what you

told the officers your last name

was?

WILLIAM

I don't think so.

ELLIOT

What did you tell them your last

name was?

WILLIAM

I don't remember.

ELLIOT

Well, is Doe your last name?

WILLIAM

I'm not sure.

ELLIOT

Do you know what your last name is?

WILLIAM

I don't remember.

ELLIOT

Joe, I'm your attorney, I'm here to

help you. It doesn't matter if you

give the court your last name or

not, they will still put you on trial.

Do you understand?

WILLIAM

Yes.

ELLIOT

So there's no reason to try and hide

your identity.

(Joe nods)

What is your last name?

WILLIAM

I would tell you if I could remember.

ELLIOT

Joe Smith, Joe Jones, Joe DiMaggio...

WILLIAM

...I don't think so.

ELLIOT

Okay. Look, we'll move on. You

understand the charges against you.

They're serious. And if you are found

guilty, you could go to prison for a

very long time.

WILLIAM

Maybe I should.

ELLIOT

What?

WILLIAM

Go to prison. I killed him. I didn't

mean to. But he was going to hit me.

ELLIOT

Yes, I know, I read your confession.

Joe, if you really felt your life

was in danger, we might be able to

use self-defense as our argument.

But before we get into that... Do

you have any family, Joe? Any friends?

WILLIAM

I don't think so.

ELLIOT

Joe... do you know what a psychiatrist

is?

WILLIAM

Yes.

ELLIOT

Have you ever seen a psychiatrist?

WILLIAM

...I'm not sure.

ELLIOT

Joe, you don't remember much about

yourself.

WILLIAM

No.

ELLIOT

...but you remember the night you

shot the man in the car.

WILLIAM

Yes.

ELLIOT

Why?

WILLIAM

...because... I can... I'm sorry,

I'm not much help.

CUT TO:

HELEN

-- and when you approached the suspect

in his apartment, did you identify

yourself as a police officer?

DIVINCI

Yes.

HELEN

Did the suspect respond?

DIVINCI

Yes, he did?

HELEN

In what way?

DIVINCI

He started shooting through the door.

HELEN

The Defendant fired six times, until

his gun was empty. We would like to

show you the weapon he used.

HELEN

And we would like to enter it into

court records. It was the same Smith

and Wesson revolver he used to

viciously murder George and Carol

Beaman.

HELEN

The prosecution would like to call

Mr. Steven J. Allen to the stand.

BAILIFF

Steven J. Allen.

HELEN

Mr. Allen, would tell the court what

you do.

STEVEN J. ALLEN

I am a lab technician for the police

department. One of my duties is to

examine weapons used in violent

crimes.

STEVEN J. ALLEN

I tested the defendant's revolver

and matched the bullets fired to the

bullets removed from the deceased.

CLYDE

That ain't my gun.

JUDGE WEINBERG

I must remind the defendant that he

is not to speak out when --

CLYDE

That ain't my gun!

CLYDE

THAT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN!

CLYDE

YOU'RE TRYIN' TO FUCKIN' FRAME ME!

CLYDE

IT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN!

CUT TO:

RODRIGUEZ

We gotta put the right gun back.

DIVINCI

We can't put the right gun back!

Without that gun, they won't convict

Joe.

RODRIGUEZ

Without that gun they won't convict

Clyde!

DIVINCI

I'm not worried about Clyde, I'm

worried about us!

RODRIGUEZ

Look, Joe's never goin' to trial,

right. He signed a goddamn confession!

Like you said, this one is open and

shut. Clyde's the one we gotta worry

about. We can't let him go back on

the street! He's a fuckin' psychopath.

He'll kill somebody again.

DIVINCI

Shit. How the hell did that piece of

puke know it wasn't his fuckin' gun?!

I don't think he knows his own fuckin'

mother, but he knows his fuckin'

gun!

RODRIGUEZ

I don't think that's important right

now.

CUT TO:

DESK OFFICER

Sorry, Divinci, can't do it.

DIVINCI

What d'you mean you can't do it? I

gotta check something.

DESK OFFICER

You gotta get written permission

from the Chief.

RODRIGUEZ

Since when?!

DESK OFFICER

Since an hour ago when he came down

here and chewed me a new asshole

bigger than a three car garage.

DIVINCI

What's the problem?

DESK OFFICER

Something about missing evidence or

who the hell knows. I just wanna

transfer the hell outa here.

DIVINCI

What the hell're we supposed to do?!

DESK OFFICER

Ask the chief. Policy ain't my

department!

CUT TO:

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Whenever you're ready.

ELLIOT

We would like to plead not guilty to

the charge of murder at this time

for reason of Insanity.

WILLIAM

But I did it.

ELLIOT

Yes, Joe. Let me handle this.

WILLIAM

But I signed the confession.

ELLIOT

Yes, Joe. Don't worry about it. I'm

the attorney.

HELEN

Your honor, can we have a moment?

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Council may approach the bench.

HELEN

Your honor, my colleague's client

admits to the killing. I don't see

any reason to go through a trial

when it's obvious he would like to

plead guilty.

ELLIOT

I don't agree.

HELEN

If he wants to plead guilty, you

have to let him plead guilty.

ELLIOT

Not if he's not of sound mind.

HELEN

Come on, Elliot!

ELLIOT

I think he's crazy. I know you think

he's just putting it on, that's D.A.

standard procedure, but I don't think

he is. So, your honor, I'm standing

by the not guilty because I believe

he's incapable of making that

judgment.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Have you had a psychiatrist look at

him?

ELLIOT

Yes, your honor.

(hands him papers)

I think you'll see that my diagnosis

is not without warrant.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

I'll review the findings and make my

decision tomorrow.

ELLIOT

Thank you, your honor.

(to Helen)

Besides, I hear there's a good chance

of beating the charges for lack of

evidence.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

Nobody can connect us to the evidence

thing... we're clean there.

DIVINCI

The most important one is this DEA

mess anyway. Once that's finished,

we're completely in the clear.

RODRIGUEZ

You know we can't do it anymore.

DIVINCI

...yeah, I guess.

RODRIGUEZ

No, we're through. That's it.

DIVINCI

Good while it lasted though. A hundred

grand apiece. Not bad for a few nights

work.

RODRIGUEZ

I just wanna get through this.

DIVINCI

We're gonna get through it. No

evidence problems on this one.

RODRIGUEZ

I hope not... I don't know, Frank,

lately I been thinkin'... maybe what

we did wasn't such a good idea.

DIVINCI

Hey, we took out a few scumbags,

that's it. Nobody's ever gonna miss

those shitheels. They were all pieces

of garbage. Not one of 'em had a

sheet less than a mile long. Drugs,

extortion, assault. They were all

fuckin' guilty as hell and still on

the street, you know that.

RODRIGUEZ

Except the cop.

DIVINCI

Yeah, except the cop. That's part of

the job. Could just as easily have

happened to you or me.

RODRIGUEZ

But we're cops, you know? We fucked

up.

DIVINCI

We fucked up once. Once outa ten.

That's not bad.

(a beat)

I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. He was

in the wrong place at the wrong time,

what can I say. I'm not goin' down

for it.

RODRIGUEZ

I know.

DIVINCI

Look, if we got paid a decent salary

we wouldn't be tempted by this, right?

And what happens when we retire? You

think our pension's gonna take care

of us? Shit no. We are on our own. I

mean all I want in life is a goddamn

fishing boat, a beach, a couple drinks

and some Hawaiian fuckin' music.

That ain't much for twenty years

putting murdering assholes behind

bars. I mean, the dealers, the pimps,

the killers, they got no rules. We

got all the fuckin' rules. It ain't

fair. That's all I'm sayin', it ain't

fair... For awhile, we made it fair.

DIVINCI

Quit thinkin' you're a bad guy. You're

not a fuckin' bad guy. You made one

mistake. Let it go.

RODRIGUEZ

Do you think we're corrupt?

DIVINCI

Hey, I never took a fuckin' bribe in

my life.

RODRIGUEZ

Me either.

DIVINCI

Nobody ever bought me.

RODRIGUEZ

I know.

DIVINCI

No fuckin' way. Even the thought

makes me sick. And what we did has

nothing to do with being corrupt.

It's two completely different things.

Don't get 'em confused.

RODRIGUEZ

I guess you're right.

DIVINCI

I'm telling you. It's nothin' to do

with corrupt.

RODRIGUEZ

I'm worried, that's all.

DIVINCI

Hey, you gotta worry a little. It's

natural. Just don't lose your sense

of humor.

RODRIGUEZ

My sense of humor, right.

DIVINCI

The problem with people is, nobody

gives a shit about makin' the world

a better place. You and me, I don't

care what anybody says, we made the

world a better place. No matter what

happens. There are ten less drug

dealin' assholes on the street today

because of us. They're not plea

bargainin' their way back onto the

street, they're not clogging up the

courts, and they're not costing the

tax payers a fuckin' penny because

they're not in prison. They were

garbage. And there's nothin' wrong

with takin' out the garbage.

RODRIGUEZ

So, you think you'll get back with

Caroline?

DIVINCI

Shit. Nothin' I ever do is good

enough, you know?

RODRIGUEZ

Never is, never was, never will be.

DIVINCI

Guess I gotta make the effort. It's

gonna cost me if I don't.

RODRIGUEZ

Tell me about it. You know how much

I got left.

DIVINCI

You're gonna think I'm an idiot,

but... I like Cynthia. There's no

bullshit with her. I just fuckin'

like her.

RODRIGUEZ

I think you just like fuckin' her.

DIVINCI

Yeah, that, too.

CYNTHIA

What the hell, Joe, at least you

won't get run over.

CUT TO:

JUDGE WEINBERG

The defendant will stand and face

the jury.

JUDGE

What is your verdict?

JURY FOREMAN

We find the defendant, Clyde David

Dunner, not guilty.

CLYDE

Fuckin' A!

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

-- when was the last time you saw

him? -- Uh-huh -- And you haven't

seen him since then?

RODRIGUEZ

We gotta talk.

DIVINCI

(into phone)

Just a second.

(covers phone)

Calm down. I heard. Clyde walked.

RODRIGUEZ

No!

(leans in close)

They're takin' Joe to trial.

RODRIGUEZ

They found him mentally unable to

plead so his attorney pleaded not

guilty by reason of insanity.

DIVINCI

You gotta be kiddin' me.

RODRIGUEZ

Yeah, that's me, I love to make people

laugh. You hear the one about the

two cops who popped the undercover

DEA?

CUT TO:

CYNTHIA

Who the hell're you and what the

fuck are you doing in here?!

(calls down hall)

HEY, BOB, I GOT AN ASSHOLE IN THE

DRESSING ROOM.

(to the man)

I suggest you get out before Bob

gets here. He doesn't like assholes.

ASIAN MAN

You're Cynthia Webb.

CYNTHIA

(calls down hall)

BOB!

ASIAN MAN

But you are Cynthia Webb the famous

dancer, yes?

CYNTHIA

Yeah, yeah, nice try, get out.

ASIAN MAN

I liked your show very much.

CYNTHIA

What the hell's this?!

CYNTHIA

A subpoena?! For what?! I didn't do

anything!

CYNTHIA

Oh shit... oh shit. He served me! He

fuckin' served me!

MAN'S VOICE

Hello.

ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE

Detective Divinci?

DIVINCI

Yeah.

ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE

This is Sergeant Gardner down at the

station.

SERGEANT GARDNER

Sorry to call so late, but I got a

hysterical woman here says she needs

to talk to you about a murder.

SERGEANT GARDNER

I told her I couldn't call you at

home, but she said that it was very

important. A matter of, you know,

life and death.

DIVINCI

What's her name?

SERGEANT GARDNER

Cynthia.

DIVINCI

Tell her to wait, I'll be right down.

WOMAN

What the hell're you doing?

DIVINCI

I gotta go down to the station.

WOMAN

Now? What time is it?

DIVINCI

Go back to sleep.

WOMAN

Frank, this is no way to repair our

marriage, you know?

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

Hey!

CYNTHIA

Frank, I can't do this. He came to

the club. You gotta --

DIVINCI

Not here!

CYNTHIA

I thought you said all I had to do

was pick him out?! That's what you

said, that's all I had to do. I did

what you said. But that was supposed

to be all.

DIVINCI

SHUT UP!

DIVINCI

What're you talkin' about?

CYNTHIA

They want me in court.

CYNTHIA

You promised me I wasn't gonna have

to do anything! What the hell is

goin' on?!

CYNTHIA

I can't do this, Frank. I can't go

into court. I'm gettin' outa here!

DIVINCI

You are not getting outa here!

CYNTHIA

Well I can't go to court! THAT'S NOT

WHAT YOU SAID I'D HAVE TO DO!

DIVINCI

WELL THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN!

NOW JUST FUCKIN' CALM DOWN FOR A

SECOND AND LET ME THINK!

CYNTHIA

Fine. Think away.

DIVINCI

Look, you're a witness, that's all.

You got nothin' to worry about. You

saw something happen --

CYNTHIA

-- What?! What did I see?!

DIVINCI

I will tell you everything you gotta

know. You understand? Everything.

You will know exactly what to say.

CUT TO:

ELLIOT

Hi, Joe. You're looking much better.

WILLIAM

I guess jail's been good for me.

ELLIOT

Trial date's been set for Thursday.

WILLIAM

I've been thinking about what I did...

and I don't think it's right that I

try getting off.

ELLIOT

Excuse me?

WILLIAM

I want to plead guilty. I killed a

man and I should be punished.

ELLIOT

...I'm a little surprised.

WILLIAM

Why?

ELLIOT

Nobody ever wants to be punished for

what they've done. It's just a new

concept. But I still think our defense

is reasonable. I don't believe, under

the condition you were in, that you

were responsible for your actions.

WILLIAM

But why was I carrying a gun? I had

no right to carry a gun.

ELLIOT

If you hadn't been carrying the gun,

you might be dead.

WILLIAM

And he might be alive.

ELLIOT

I understand... Can I think about

this?

WILLIAM

No. I've made up my mind.

CUT TO:

RODRIGUEZ

What if she takes off?

DIVINCI

Then we got no goddamn witness puts

him at the scene.

RODRIGUEZ

And what happens if she testifies

and nobody fuckin' believes her?

DIVINCI

Perjury, maybe. But that's a fifty

fifty. They might believe her.

RODRIGUEZ

Shit, Frank, she's a goddamn stripper

for Chrissake, who's gonna believe

her. I don't believe her when she's

telling the truth!

DIVINCI

What?

OFFICER

Ahh, we got two bodies out here and

three more in the house.

DIVINCI

So?

OFFICER

I was just wondering if you were

gonna be the primary on this one,

that's all.

DIVINCI

Yeah, yeah, we're comin'. Just give

us some room.

RODRIGUEZ

She could blow the whole thing. She

could tie us in and that would be

it. We'd be fuckin' fried.

DIVINCI

If it looks like she's gonna crumble

we'll take steps.

RODRIGUEZ

What steps?

DIVINCI

One more chalk outline more or less

in this city who's gonna know?

RODRIGUEZ

Oh shit, Frank.

DIVINCI

Hey, hey, you think I like this?!

RODRIGUEZ

We just can't go around killin'

everybody!

DIVINCI

Just a second. Look around. Whatta

we got here? Two stiffs on the street,

shot to shit, three more inside.

That's five chalk lines in one night

in one deal in one neighborhood in

one city. Let me fill you in on some

statistics, we're not killin'

everybody.

(a beat, then --)

Look, this is strictly last resort.

Okay? But let's not kid ourselves.

If push comes to shove, somebody has

to go down. If you got another

candidate, I'm willin' to listen.

Ms Webb?

CYNTHIA

Yeah.

RICHARD STEIN

Any chance we could get together

today?

CYNTHIA

I'm ah... pretty busy.

RICHARD STEIN

It won't take long. Will you be home

Good, Arthur, thanks. Would you like

No, I'm fine.

WILLIAM

Well, this is all a bit of a mystery.

You certainly got my attention with

DIVINCI

Oh, yeah, sorry. I didn't expect --

what're you doing here?

RICHARD STEIN

I have to talk with Cynthia Webb. A

witness in -- well, wait, aren't you

and Detective Rodriguez on this one?

DIVINCI

(vamping)

Yeah, yeah, that's why I'm here. I

wanted to go over some of the details.

RICHARD STEIN

Me, too. Is she there?

DIVINCI

No.

RICHARD STEIN

I was supposed to meet her at two.

(looks at watch)

Do you know her?

DIVINCI

What d'you mean?

RICHARD STEIN

Well, I just mean, if she's not

here... you were...

(a little awkward)

...inside.

DIVINCI

(forces a smile)

Oh, yeah, the legal thing. Well,

she's a witness in a murder case.

And when they don't answer a knock

and the door's open, it's my

experience, you know. I like to make

sure there's no dead bodies layin'

around.

(pulls door shut)

Don't tell on me.

RICHARD STEIN

No, no, of course not... Well, maybe

I should wait. She might be stuck in

traffic or something.

DIVINCI

Yeah. If she shows up, let me know.

I'd like to talk to her, too.

RICHARD STEIN

Of course.

DIVINCI

See you in court.

RICHARD STEIN

Right.

Yeah.

Yes.

WILLIAM

...yes.

CUT TO:

HELEN

What are you telling me?!

HELEN

She missed the appointment? She forget

you were coming? What?!

RICHARD STEIN

If you want my best guess, I'd say

she split.

HELEN

She split, our witness split... Can't

we keep our evidence and witnesses

from disappearing around here? I

mean what do I have to do, lock them

in the trunk of my car? What the

fuck is going on?! I want that bitch

back here and on the stand or in

jail!

RICHARD STEIN

I'll get her.

CUT TO:

MANNY

-- yeah, uh-huh.

(takes notes)

Why you think he'd go there?

DIVINCI

We need to talk.

MANNY

(covers phone)

Just a second.

DIVINCI

Not just a second, now!

MANNY

(into phone)

I'll call you back.

(hangs up)

What d'you want, Divinci?

DIVINCI

I got a witness who took off. I gotta

get her back. I don't got a lotta

time.

MANNY

You're the fuckin' police. What're

you comin' to me for?!

DIVINCI

Don't ask fuckin' questions, you

just find her!

MANNY

Where've I seen her before?

DIVINCI

She dances.

MANNY

Yeah, right, okay. So what'd she

take off for?

DIVINCI

I said --

MANNY

-- I know what you fuckin' said, but

you want me to find her I gotta know

why the fuck she took off! So I know

where not to look! Okay?!

DIVINCI

...she's supposed to testify. She

got scared, thinks somebody might

kill her, so she's hidin'. That's

why I want you to find her. If

somebody is tryin' to pop her, I

don't want anyone knowin' where she

is. Manny eyes Divinci. He doesn't

believe anything anybody tells him.

Especially in his business.

MANNY

How long I got?

DIVINCI

Two days.

MANNY

Shit, two fuckin' days!

DIVINCI

Find her, puss head.

MANNY

Sure, Detective. Always like to help

out the police whenever possible!

CUT TO:

RICHARD STEIN

(to Helen)

Isn't that Arthur Baylor?

HELEN

Yes.

RICHARD STEIN

What's he doing here?

HELEN

What the hell?

BAILIFF

Hear ye, hear ye. All rise, face our

flag and recognize the principles

for which it stands. The Criminal

Court, Department G is now in session.

The Honorable Harold W. Pine

presiding.

BAILIFF

Please be seated and come to order.

BAILIFF

The People versus Joe Doe in case

number 95-24705.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Before we proceed, I'd like to ask

the Defense if there's anything this

court should be made aware of.

ARTHUR

Yes, your honor. I have joined the

defense in the representation of Mr.

William Dane McCall, otherwise known

to this court as Joe Doe.

ARTHUR

I have represented the McCall family

for several years before William

McCall's disappearance seven years

ago. It was assumed that he had died,

but since he has reappeared under

these tragic circumstances, I would

ask this court for a continuance to

allow the defense to prepare

adequately in light of his real

identity now being known.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

How long do you need.

ARTHUR

One week should be sufficient.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Any objection to a week's continuance

by the State?

HELEN

I don't... believe so, your honor.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Then I grant a one week continuance.

We will start the proceedings next

Monday morning.

CUT TO:

NEWSCASTER

-- when it was discovered that the

man who has confessed to killing an

undercover DEA agent, was actually

himself thought dead for seven years.

The man who signed the confession as

Joe Doe is actually William Dane

McCall, brother of Nathan McCall.

Both are sons of the founder of McCall

International, a corporation involved

in telecommunications, computer design

and development and other related

industries. The net worth of both

men is estimated at over a billion

dollars --

CUT TO:

RODRIGUEZ

-- but William McCall shunned the

business world and turned his life

to medicine, receiving his medical

degree from Harvard in 1969. Once

again he turned his back on the

established norm and spent several

years in Africa performing organ

transplants for the poor.

RODRIGUEZ

Jesus Christ, this is who you picked?

A goddamn surgeon who performs organ

transplants on poor Africans?!

DIVINCI

He was living in the fuckin' street!

How the hell was I supposed to know

he was a goddamn doctor?!

RODRIGUEZ

He's not a goddamn doctor! You picked

a fuckin' Saint to pin a fuckin'

murder on!

RODRIGUEZ

When we pick 'em, we really fuckin'

pick 'em. We shoulda just picked up

the fuckin' Pope.

DIVINCI

(reading)

-- he disappeared seven years ago on

September 19 two weeks after the

tragic death of his wife and two

young children in a multiple vehicle

accident. At the time it was assumed

that he had returned to Africa, but

that was never confirmed. What William

McCall has been doing for seven years

is now the mystery that the court

will try to help unravel.

DIVINCI

Alright, alright, let's think here.

What's the worse case scenario?

RODRIGUEZ

Are you asking me if I can think of

something worse than what we've done

that we can still do, or something

worse that might happen to us if

this all blows up and we are convicted

and sent to jail and die in the

electric chair and go to hell?

DIVINCI

Work with me here.

RODRIGUEZ

I'm sorry. I'm a little on edge.

Would you repeat the question?

DIVINCI

Even if the doc walks, there's no

evidence ties us to it. There's only

one person who can connect us to

Hudd.

RODRIGUEZ

Okay, fine, I don't wanna argue about

it anymore. Let's just fuckin' kill

her.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI'S VOICE

We need to talk.

MANNY

Are you fuckin' with me?

DIVINCI

No, I'm not fuckin' with you. Are

you fuckin' with me?!

MANNY

You don't know?

DIVINCI

Know what?

MANNY

Well this is a good one. You're a

cop and you don't know.

DIVINCI

Stop it.

MANNY

Cops got her. Ain't that a gas. Cops

got her, you're a cop, and you gotta

find out from me. It's a crazy world

we live in, don't you think?

DIVINCI

Cops?! What fuckin' cops?!

MANNY

I don't know what fuckin' cops. All

I know is, my people got to her

sister's place and she was already

gone. Her sister said some cops took

her. I thought it was you!

SECRETARY

What an asshole.

MANNY

You're a good judge of character.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

-- look, she's our witness, if she's

in custody, somebody better tell me!

DIVINCI

Anything?

RODRIGUEZ

Nothin'. Nobody knows nothin'. The

D.A. thinks she's gone. D.E.A. doesn't

know shit.

DIVINCI

If she was bein' held by police,

we'd know.

RODRIGUEZ

Unless she said somethin'.

DIVINCI

If she said something we wouldn't be

sittin' here.

(a beat, then --)

I think it's that lyin' piece of

shit.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

Don't ever lie to me again.

CUT TO:

DUNCAN

First trial, huh.

WILLIAM

Yes.

DUNCAN

I got one piece of advise. When you

break for lunch, don't get the

pastrami.

GUARD

Time to go.

THE BAILIFF'S VOICE

Hear ye, hear ye. All rise, face our

flag and recognize the principles

for which it stands.

BAILIFF'S VOICE

The Criminal Court, Department G is

now in session. The Honorable Harold

W. Pine presiding.

(We HEAR people rise)

Please be seated and come to order.

BAILIFF'S VOICE

The People versus William McCall in

case number 95-24705.

CUT TO:

HELEN

-- when he pulled this gun and fired

at the driver of the car. Killing

him instantly. Let the record show

that this is the weapon used in the

crime, a Smith and Wesson forty-four

caliber handgun.

RICHARD STEIN

All these goddamn guns are startin'

to look the same to me.

DISSOLVE TO:

HELEN

And when you arrested the defendant,

did he deny that he had killed Agent

Hudd.

DIVINCI

No.

HELEN

Can you describe the defendant's

condition at the time of his arrest.

DIVINCI

He was drunk. We could smell the

booze on him. But we drew blood. He

didn't object.

HELEN

We have the blood test report that

shows --

(picks up report)

-- that he had four times the legal

limit to drive. The people would

like to enter this into evidence.

CUT TO:

ELLIOT

-- and you arrested the defendant

four days after the killing. What

lead you to suspect Mr. McCall?

RODRIGUEZ

You ask questions. Work the

neighborhood. Find out who was on

the street that night.

ELLIOT

Yes, but specifically Mr. McCall? He

had no previous criminal record.

RODRIGUEZ

We found someone who'd seen him in

the area. So we picked him up for

questioning. We didn't expect it to

be him. But if someone saw him in

the area that night we would want to

talk to him. If he wasn't the killer,

he might've seen the killer. Just

routine really.

ELLIOT

Where did you find the defendant?

RODRIGUEZ

On the street. Corner of Third and

Madison.

ELLIOT

What was he doing?

RODRIGUEZ

He was passed out.

ELLIOT

But you knew it was the man you were

looking for.

RODRIGUEZ

Yes.

ELLIOT

Based on what?

RODRIGUEZ

His description.

ELLIOT

Who provided you with the description?

RODRIGUEZ

(hesitates a beat)

Cynthia something, I think.

ELLIOT

I believe her name is Cynthia Webb.

According to the statement filed the

night she picked him out of the line-

up. The name familiar?

RODRIGUEZ

Yes... that's her.

ELLIOT

Where did you find Ms Webb?

RODRIGUEZ

On the street. Same area.

ELLIOT

And she agreed to pick the defendant

out of a line up.

RODRIGUEZ

Yes.

ELLIOT

Where you aware that Ms Webb

disappeared after she was served

with a subpoena?

RODRIGUEZ

Yes, my partner and I tried to contact

her about the case and were

unsuccessful.

ELLIOT

Thank you, Detective, that's all the

questions I have.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

To justice in all its forms.

RODRIGUEZ

We're not home free yet.

DIVINCI

Without Ms Webb, there's no place

they can go. We still got the

confession, the gun, the ballistics...

And I don't give a shit about all

this African doctor crap... the man

is a drunk and he's been a drunk for

seven goddamn years. So lets have a

drink for drunks.

DIVINCI

That's the thing about life. You

control it or it controls you. Most

people don't understand that. They

try'n blame their fuck-ups on

something or somebody else. But it's

not like that. I don't wanna hear

why your life's a mess. It's a mess

cause you're a mess. That simple.

They're waitin' to live happily ever

after. But after what? After all the

shit happens? Well, I got a clue for

everybody, the shit never stops

happening. So you deal with it or

you get buried in it. I'm not talkin'

about you, you know what I'm sayin'

here.

RODRIGUEZ

Yeah.

DIVINCI

Life don't work in mysterious ways.

There ain't no mystery to it. You

just work it. And you don't take it

too serious. You can't take it too

serious otherwise you get fragile.

And you can't be fragile and have

any fuckin' fun.

RODRIGUEZ

You think I'm fragile?

DIVINCI

That's the first sign of trouble,

when you start askin' other people.

RODRIGUEZ

...I just wish I knew where the hell

she was.

CUT TO:

RICHARD STEIN

(referring to papers)

-- so I think we'll have to rely on

the confession for his description

of what happened. He'll never take

the stand, even if --

RICHARD STEIN

(into phone)

D.A.'s office... What?... When?...

Where will --

RICHARD STEIN

They found Cynthia Webb.

HELEN

Where?

RICHARD STEIN

I don't know.

HELEN

When?

RICHARD STEIN

I don't know.

HELEN

Well who the hell was that?

RICHARD STEIN

I don't know. They hung up.

HELEN

What the fuck is going on?!

CUT TO:

HELEN

Your honor, the people call Ms.

Cynthia Webb to the stand.

BAILIFF

Raise your right hand.

BAILIFF

You swear to tell the truth, the

whole truth and nothing but the truth

so help you God.

CYNTHIA

Sure.

BAILIFF

You may be seated.

WILLIAM

I know her.

ELLIOT

She's the woman who identified you.

WILLIAM

No. I mean I know her.

ARTHUR

...How?

WILLIAM

I'm not sure... I think I lived near

her.

HELEN

Please state your name for the court.

CYNTHIA

Cynthia Webb.

HELEN

Do you see the man that you identified

in a police line-up in this room.

CYNTHIA

Yes.

HELEN

Is it the defendant, Mr. McCall?

CYNTHIA

Yes.

HELEN

Please describe what you saw the

night of September 14th.

CYNTHIA

I was comin' out of an all night

minimart --

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

HELEN

And you're positive the man you saw

with the gun is the defendant.

CYNTHIA

Yeah.

HELEN

No further questions.

ARTHUR

Miss Webb... is it Miss?

CYNTHIA

Yes.

ARTHUR

Miss Webb, had you ever seen the

defendant before that night, the

night you described to us?

CYNTHIA

No.

ARTHUR

Do you know what perjury is?

CYNTHIA

When you lie.

ARTHUR

When you lie under oath in a court

of law. Do you know what the penalty

for that is?

CYNTHIA

You go to jail.

ARTHUR

Yes... Cynthia, have you ever seen

the defendant before that night?

HELEN

Objection. The witness has already

answered that question.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Sustained.

ARTHUR

I just want to give the witness the

opportunity to remember if she could

have seen Mr. McCall anyplace else

before the night in question.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Ms. Webb, do you understand the

consequences of perjury?

CYNTHIA

Yes.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Let's get on with it then.

ARTHUR

What did you buy the night you went

into the mini-mart?

CYNTHIA

What did I buy?

ARTHUR

You remembered seeing Mr. McCall

that night and hearing the gunshot

and a car crash. I just wondered if

you remembered what you bought in

the mini-mart.

CYNTHIA

...shampoo I think.

ARTHUR

That's all?

CYNTHIA

Yes.

ARTHUR

Where do you live?

CYNTHIA

4356 17th Street. Number 37.

ARTHUR

Is that close to where this mini-

mart is?

CYNTHIA

Close? Sort of.

ARTHUR

How far would you say?

CYNTHIA

I don't really know.

ARTHUR

Within walking distance?

CYNTHIA

No... I don't think so.

ARTHUR

Did you walk there that night or

drive?

CYNTHIA

I ahh... drove.

ARTHUR

You drove. But when you left the

mini-mart you stated that you walked

down the street.

CYNTHIA

Yeah.

ARTHUR

How far?

CYNTHIA

...to the corner.

HELEN

Objection. Your honor, I don't see a

point to this line of questioning.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Is there a point?

ARTHUR

Yes, your honor. Since this is the

only witness, I'm trying to establish

what the scene was like that night.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Try to get there as quickly as

possible.

ARTHUR

(to Cynthia)

And how far away from the corner was

the Mini-mart? For example was it in

the middle of the block, close to

the corner, where?

CYNTHIA

In the middle I think.

ARTHUR

So you walked all the way to the

corner. I assume then you were walking

back to your car, yes?

CYNTHIA

...yeah.

ARTHUR

Was there a reason you parked so far

away?

CYNTHIA

(getting nervous)

Um... there were lots of cars parked

on the street.

ARTHUR

Was there anyone else on the street

besides you?

CYNTHIA

No.

ARTHUR

Lots of cars, but no people. Any

traffic?

CYNTHIA

I don't remember.

ARTHUR

So you were the only person to see

Joe on the street that night?

CYNTHIA

I didn't see anybody else.

ARTHUR

So you heard a gunshot, a car crash

and a man running with a gun in his

hand.

CYNTHIA

Yes.

ARTHUR

What did you do then? Did you call

the police, 911?

CYNTHIA

I went home.

ARTHUR

You went home. Straight home?

CYNTHIA

Yes.

ARTHUR

And you're sure it was Joe you saw

that night?

CYNTHIA

Yes.

ARTHUR

When you went home.

CYNTHIA

Yes.

ARTHUR

When you went home you saw Joe?

CYNTHIA

No.

HELEN

Objection. Defense is trying to

confuse the witness.

ARTHUR

I'm not trying to confuse the witness,

it's the witness that's trying to

confuse the court. I have witnesses

who will refute her testimony.

Witnesses who were on that corner

the night of the shooting, who never

saw Ms. Webb, who never heard the

gunshot, who never saw Joe run past.

Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment

building that night because he lived

in the alley next to it. Isn't that

right, Ms Webb?

HELEN

Objection!

ARTHUR

When I referred to him as Joe, you

knew who I was talking about, didn't

you. This case is the People versus

Mr. William McCall. Not Joe. Joe has

never been mentioned in this trial.

How did you know who I was talking

about, Ms. Webb?

ARTHUR

Ms. Webb, how did you know that Joe

was the defendant?

CYNTHIA

He lived in the alley next to my

apartment building.

HELEN

(to herself)

Oh shit.

ARTHUR

Why did you lie to this court?

CYNTHIA

I don't know.

ARTHUR

Are you afraid of somebody?

CYNTHIA

I don't know.

ARTHUR

Are you protecting somebody?

CYNTHIA

I don't know.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Answer the questions, Ms. Webb or

I'll be forced to cite you for

contempt.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RODRIGUEZ

She didn't talk.

DIVINCI

Don't hold your breath.

RODRIGUEZ

You think she'll talk.

DIVINCI

I know she'll talk.

RODRIGUEZ

We'll make it look gang related.

DIVINCI

Problem is we're gonna need another

gun.

RODRIGUEZ

The problem?! Have you forgotten?

She's in fucking jail. That's the

goddamn problem.

DIVINCI

Since when is being in jail a guaranty

of a long life? You just get a fuckin'

gun.

CUT TO:

MANNY

Oh shit. I didn't do anything!

DIVINCI

Everything's fine, Manny. I just

came to apologize.

(looks at secretary)

We need some privacy...

DIVINCI

Just one more favor. I want you to

bail somebody out of jail.

MANNY

You're kiddin'.

DIVINCI

Bail's twenty-five thousand.

DIVINCI

I want her out tonight. And don't

tell her who. It's a surprise.

MANNY

And how'm I payin' for this? They

don't take American Express.

DIVINCI

I know you know how to exchange that.

It's worth a lot more than twenty-

five grand. You can keep the change.

(points to cocaine)

I want her back in two hours... Or

I'll nail you for possession.

MANNY

How'd you get to be such a prick?

DIVINCI

DNA.

MANNY

What a piece of shit.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DUNCAN

You don't have to say nothin', but...

you really a doctor?

WILLIAM

...I was... a surgeon.

DUNCAN

No shit, no shit, really. A surgeon.

I know I'm nobody to judge, but you

musta been a smart guy. What the

hell's a smart guy like you doin' in

here?

WILLIAM

...I had an affair with another

woman... a nurse at the hospital I

worked at. It was nothing... I can't

even remember much about her... Except

my wife found out. We had a fight.

She left the house, took the kids...

She was hysterical. I should've done

something... gone after them, I don't

know... they were killed in a car

accident about a mile from the

house... I've never told anybody

that... about why she left.

DUNCAN

Hey, doc, you can trust me. It won't

go no farther.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI

You get the gun?

RODRIGUEZ

I got it.

DIVINCI

Everything okay?

RODRIGUEZ

Are you kidding? We're going to kill

a goddamn witness who's in fucking

jail because we killed an undercover

DEA agent. I'm sorry, but this kinda

shit troubles me a little.

DIVINCI

Take off the dress and get back in

the game. We gotta do what we gotta

do.

RODRIGUEZ

Yeah. I know. Let's just get it over

with.

CUT TO:

CYNTHIA

I don't understand. Why can't you

tell me who put up the bond?

MANNY

Look, a guy comes in, says bail her

out, gives me the money, I do it.

That's how I make my living, I bail

fuckin' people outa jail. You wait

with me.

CYNTHIA

Was it a cop?

MANNY

Yeah, right. Cops bail people outa

jail all the time. Doesn't there

seem to be a dichotomy there for

you?

CYNTHIA

I don't like this.

MANNY

You wanna stay in jail, that's up to

you. Or you come with me.

CYNTHIA

What'd he look like?

MANNY

You're a stripper right? Lotta guys

fall in love with your type. But

they don't know how to get close,

know what I mean? Somebody wants you

to owe them something.

(shrugs)

Take it or leave it.

RODRIGUEZ

This is the last time, Frank. The

last time we kill somebody.

DIVINCI

Yeah, it's the last time.

RODRIGUEZ

This'll be eleven, Frank. Eleven is

enough.

DIVINCI

I get the picture.

RODRIGUEZ

It was all okay until you shot Hudd.

DIVINCI

What's goin' on here? You mad at me

or something?

RODRIGUEZ

It wasn't my idea to start killing

people, Frank. That's all I'm sayin'.

We're in this goddamn mess because

you started killing people.

DIVINCI

Drug dealers don't qualify as people.

Never did, never will. So what the

hell's wrong with you tonight? You

suddenly worried about where all the

money went?

RODRIGUEZ

I'm just sick of it, that's all.

CUT TO:

RODRIGUEZ

What're you doin'?

DIVINCI

I need some fresh air.

RODRIGUEZ

Frank --

DIVINCI

Talk to me, okay? Just fuckin' talk

to me.

RODRIGUEZ

I don't know... I owe some money. I

don't know how I'm gonna pay it...

DIVINCI

You gambling again?

RODRIGUEZ

Yeah, yeah... I just couldn't...

Frank... let's forget about this.

Let's just get the fuck outa here.

We got enough money, let's go. We'll

get outa the country or something.

RODRIGUEZ

What the hell're you doin'?!

DIVINCI

Take off your shirt.

RODRIGUEZ

What're you talkin' about?

DIVINCI

Just take off your shirt. If there's

nothin' to worry about, then I'll

apologize. But I'm not gonna argue.

Take off your fuckin' shirt now.

RODRIGUEZ

What is this, you piece of shit?!

You don't trust me?! Is that it?!

YOU DON'T FUCKIN' TRUST ME AFTER ALL

WE'VE BEEN THROUGH?!

DIVINCI

...Take off your shirt.

RODRIGUEZ

Fuck you, you don't trust me.

DIVINCI

I'm askin' you one more time.

RODRIGUEZ

You wanna shoot me? Shoot me.

DIVINCI

Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. I'm

fuckin' nervous. Like you. Forget

it. This thing... shit. Let's just

get it over with.

DIVINCI

I'll just feel a whole lot better

when she's dead. Then we're off the

hook.

RODRIGUEZ

Right.

DIVINCI

YOU FUCKIN' RAT!

RODRIGUEZ

Yeah... yeah... I am, I'm a fuckin'

rat... I traded you, Frank, I fuckin'

traded you... Simms knows everything.

RODRIGUEZ

Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the

fuck over with! I DESERVE IT! I

FUCKING DESERVE TO DIE!

DIVINCI

You're fuckin' right.

DIVINCI

...Get out.

RODRIGUEZ

Frank --

DIVINCI

(calm)

Get outa the car NOW!

DIVINCI

This is why you can never -- ever --

lose your sense of fuckin' humor.

CUT TO:

MAN'S VOICE (VIC)

I guess we caught you at a bad time.

VIC

But we all have problems.

VIC

Oh shit. You shot him, you fuckin'

shot him!

CUT TO:

AGENT SARKASIAN

Divinci musta figured it. I didn't

think he'd kill his own partner

though.

SIMMS

He's an animal.

AGENT HOOPER

Recorders busted up. But we might be

able to salvage some of the tape.

SIMMS

I want him. You understand me, I

don't care what it takes. I want

that sonuvabitch!

CUT TO:

MANNY

Shit! Who the fuck're you?!

AGENT SARKASIAN

Ms. Webb. We'd like you to come with

us.

CYNTHIA

This was the big secret? Shit. You're

an asshole.

CUT TO:

SIMMS

Who set it up?

CYNTHIA

I don't know.

AGENT HOOPER

It was Divinci wasn't it?

CYNTHIA

I don't know.

SIMMS

Which one pulled the trigger? Divinci

or Rodriguez?

CYNTHIA

I don't know.

SIMMS

Detective Rodriguez is dead. He was

shot in the head last night.

SIMMS

Rodriguez was wearing a recorder.

Divinci found it. You can do addition,

can't you.

CYNTHIA

You're full of shit.

AGENT SARKASIAN

Just tell us what you know.

CYNTHIA

Where's Divinci?

SIMMS

We don't know. But we're gonna find

him.

CYNTHIA

You're gonna find him?

(smiles sarcastically)

Right... I don't know a fuckin' thing.

SIMMS

Get a copy of the tape to Bailor.

But make sure it doesn't come from

us.

CUT TO:

GUARD

Your attorney's here.

CYNTHIA

What attorney?

ARTHUR

Hi, Cynthia. Please sit down.

CYNTHIA

I got nothin' to say.

So I'm told.

RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE

Fuck you, you don't trust me.

Right.

YOU FUCKIN' RAT!

RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE

Yeah... yeah... I am, I'm a fuckin'

rat... I traded you, Frank, I fuckin'

traded you... Simms knows everything.

Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the

fuck over with! I DESERVE IT! I

FUCKING DESERVE TO DIE!

DIVINCI'S VOICE

You're fuckin' right.

ARTHUR

I think you know my client is

innocent. That's all I care about,

my client. But I understand why you're

scared. You're already facing perjury

charges. My guess is, your involvement

is deeper than that. But I don't

really care, I'm not after you... I

get nothing if you go to jail. But I

think if I help you, I can help my

client.

CYNTHIA

...how?

ARTHUR

William -- Joe -- didn't do it, did

he?

ARTHUR

Why don't you sit down.

CUT TO:

SIMMS

No goddamn way! I'm not going to

grant that whore immunity. She lied

on the stand, she's protecting

somebody. And she's involved. I want

them all.

ARTHUR

Before I leave, let me remind you

that you have shit for a case. If

you really care about seeing justice

for your dead agent, don't blow this

deal. Immunity for her testimony is

a small price for a bad cop. It's

the only way she's going to talk.

ARTHUR

And William McCall walks, right now,

all charges dropped.

SIMMS

If what she says is any good, I'll

deal. If it isn't, then nobody goes

anywhere.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

REPORTERS

How does it feel to be a free man

again?

REPORTERS

Do you remember everything that

happened to you? What are your plans?

WILLIAM

I just want to go back to work.

REPORTERS

As a surgeon?

WILLIAM

Yes.

REPORTERS

What about the signed confession,

did the police coerce you into signing

it?

ARTHUR

I'm sorry, no more questions.

NATHAN

Good to have you back, Will.

WILLIAM

...I'd like to make one stop.

NATHAN

I know.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ELLIOT

-- you know, it just didn't make

sense, a man wanting to be punished

for a crime? How many times does

that happen? Once in a lifetime, I

can tell you.

ARTHUR

-- to tell the truth, I had no other

witnesses to refute her testimony.

But she didn't know that. All we

knew was that she was reluctant to

testify. You look for signs.

A MAN

My God, we thought you were dead,

you know. It's just incredible that

you're here.

A WOMAN

Life moves in such strange ways. Oh,

I just think what might've happened

to you had you not been arrested for

killing that poor policeman. You

still might be on the street.

ANOTHER WOMAN

Joe, you look wonderful. After what

you've been through... I just can't

imagine.

ANOTHER MAN (SINCLAIR)

When you're ready to come back to

work, let me know. I've already spoken

to the board, they're ready to re-

certify you anytime. I can put you

in the emergency sector until you

get warmed up. We all want you back.

We can't afford to waste someone of

your talent.

WILLIAM

...I'm ready.

CUT TO:

FOUR MONTHS LATER

CUT TO:

MAN'S VOICE (DIVINCI)

I guess you had no choice.

DIVINCI

You had to do the right thing.

CYNTHIA

What d'you want?

DIVINCI

What do I want?

DIVINCI

Why're you asking me that? You gonna

grant me three wishes? I don't know

where to start. Let's see... money

would be nice... love would be

better... but a little loyalty...

you can never get enough of that.

(moves up to her)

...But we'll start with... money.

CYNTHIA

This is all I've got.

CYNTHIA

They'll catch you.

DIVINCI

I don't think so.

CYNTHIA

You wanna bet?

DIVINCI

They don't have a clue, baby. And

you wanna know why? Because I am

following my heart.

DIVINCI

And they don't know where that is.

CYNTHIA

So tell me about your plans. I think

I'd like to hear 'em now.

DIVINCI

Loyalty is what it all comes down

to. Nothing holds together when it's

gone. And once it's gone, you don't

ever get it back... You shouldn't've

told 'em.

CYNTHIA

I shouldn't've done a lotta things

in my life. But that's not one of

'em.

DIVINCI

Let me tell you something... the

only difference between a liar and a

witness is that just one of 'em knows

what he's doing.

CUT TO:

DIVINCI'S VOICE

Shut the door and lock it.

MANNY

Jesus Christ!

MANNY

You scared the shit outa me.

DIVINCI

Lock the door.

DIVINCI

One more favor, Manny.

MANNY

Since when did I become such a good

guy?

DIVINCI

I'm takin' some time off. I want a

car, here tonight, and a driver. You

can do that for your old friend,

right?

MANNY

(disgusted)

Yeah, I can do that. But you are a

hot fuckin' potato. And drivers that

don't talk, don't come cheap.

DIVINCI

I got the money. Just put it together.

CUT TO:

VOICES

-- come on, hang in there, hold on.

OTHER SURGEON

Just like riding a bike.

CUT TO:

MANNY

Leather upholstery, moon roof, CD.

What more could you ask for?

DIVINCI

Better not be a set up.

MANNY

Want me to hold your hand?

DIVINCI

Just walk me to the door.

DIVINCI

I think I'll let you live.

MANNY

You are a real prince. Now how about

my money?

DIVINCI

You never saw me.

MANNY

Don't I wish that were true.

MANNY

Have a nice trip.

DIVINCI

Head south. Get on the interstate.

Don't break the speed limit.

DIVINCI

You know, the one thing about life...

you can never lose your sense of

humor. Without it, you got nothin'.

CLYDE

Fuckin' A.

CUT TO:

MAN'S VOICE

-- run the cardioplegia.

WILLIAM

She's fibrilating. Go on bypass.

SURGEON SINCLAIR

Forceps.

(A nurse hands him

forceps)

Just like old times.

WILLIAM

I wouldn't have done this without

you... I owe you.

SURGEON SINCLAIR

Lucky to have a donor. Never would've

survived the night. Have a suture

ready.

NURSE

(picks up suture)

I heard it was a cop's heart.

NURSE

He was shot in the head a couple

hours ago.

NURSE

They think it was gang related.

DISSOLVE TO:

FADE OUT:

THE END
