INT. SHOP. NR CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN.

The HUM of a large refrigerator just audible over the

sound of Indian music -

MARGARET, briefly glimpsed pondering cartons of milk.

The electronic PEEP of the cash til.

A man on a mobile phone pushes past MARGARET, who takes

her place second in the queue.

The female shopkeeper piles newspapers on the counter in

front of MARGARET. Distracted by images of the bombed

hotel on the TV, she hesitates for beat.

MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER

One forty-nine please.

MARGARET

How much is the milk?

MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER

Forty-nine pence.

(taking the change)

Thank you.

MARGARET turns to leave, jostled by a tall young man

wired into an ipod.

EXT. STREET. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN.

MARGARET heads down the busy street, shopping bag in

hand.

INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

MARGARET sits at breakfast with her husband DENIS,

sipping tea. DENIS butters his toast. MARGARET shakes her

head.

MARGARET

Too much. Much too much butter.

DENIS

I like butter.

MARGARET

Milk's gone up.

2

MARGARET (CONT'D)

49p a pint.

DENIS

Good grief! We'll have to

economise. I suppose we could

always sell the car.

(chuckles)

Or take in paying guests!

DENIS (CONT'D)

Watch out. She's on the prowl.

MARGARET

(to DENIS)

Eat your egg.

JUNE

Goodness! There you are.

MARGARET

Yes.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Here we are.

JUNE

I don't understand how it

happened, how could she possibly

have got out? It's very very

important -

3

JUNE (CONT'D)

Please just make it really clear.

Who's on after you?

POLICE GUARD

Dixon.

JUNE

Beautiful day. Oh, you've made a

start. Carol's coming soon, I'll

get some bags. Anything you want

to go to Mark, I'll bring up a

suitcase for it.

MARGARET

No no no no. The grey.

DENIS (O.S)

You sure?

MARGARET

Yes.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

...Definitely the grey.

4

DENIS (O.S)

Righty ho. Boss knows best.

DENIS (CONT'D)

Don't let her take my paper away.

MARGARET

Oh, I haven't had a chance to look

at that yet, dear.

JUNE

Sorry.

DENIS

Atta-girl.

DENIS (O.S) (CONT'D)

Damn.

MARGARET

Blot it...Blot it..

JUNE

Sorry ?

5

DENIS

Now look what you've done. Are

they to keep the loonies out or

you in?

DENIS (CONT'D)

I'll be off then.

MARGARET

Wear your scarf. There's a chill

out there.

SUSIE

Good morning Lady Thatcher. Are

you alright ?

(concerned)

How are you feeling ?

MARGARET

I'm fine, thank you Susie.

SUSIE

I've just been reading about the

bombings.

MARGARET

Yes. Frightful.

SUSIE

Sorry.

SUSIE (CONT'D)

These are the books for you to

sign. I brought as many as I could

find. Shall we go through your

appointments?

SUSIE (CONT'D)

We said we'd go through them

today.

6

MARGARET

Yes, of course, dear. Today.

SUSIE

The invitation has come from

Downing Street for the unveiling

of your portrait. I'll put it on

the mantelpiece, and there's an

invitation from Lord Armstrong for

lunch on the first Friday of next

month.

SUSIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

I said no because you've got a

concert that afternoon but if

you'd like to..?

SUSIE(O.S) (CONT'D)

....It looks like a very

interesting programme.

MARGARET

What are they playing?

SUSIE

I think they said Rogers and

Hammerstein.

7

MARGARET

Silly man.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

He hasn't got his scarf on.

ALFRED

Did someone cover the butter?

MARGARET

I'll go.

8

BEATRICE

Leave it.

ALFRED (CALLING AFTER)

Margaret-

ALFRED (CONT'D)

Good girl.

ALFRED (CONT'D)

Tomorrow, no matter what they do,

it'll be business as usual.

CUSTOMER (O.S.)

Two of the small beef, Mr.

Roberts.

ALFRED (O.S.)

What is the life blood of any

community? It's business....

9

ALFRED

Not just big business but small

businesses, like mine.

BEATRICE

(passing/hushed

aside)

Margaret!

BEATRICE (CONT'D)

CUPS!

ALFRED

We on this island are strong.

We're self-reliant. Sometimes

we're plain bloody minded.

ALFRED (CONT'D)

But we also believe in helping

each other. And I don't mean by

state hand-outs...

PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 1

Margaret, do you want to come to

the pictures?

10

PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 2

She can't come, she's got to

study.

PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 2 (CONT'D)

Miss Hoity Toity!

ALFRED (V.O.)

Never run with the crowd,

Margaret. Go your own way.

ALFRED OOV

(close to)

Open it then.

MARGARET

(looking up)

I've got a place at Oxford.

ALFRED

Don't let me down Margaret.

11

MARGARET

(calling out)

Mother?

BEATRICE

(shakes head)

My hands are still damp.

BEATRICE

(passing/hushed

aside)

Margaret!

BEATRICE (CONT'D)

CUPS!

12

DENIS

(without taking his

eyes of the job)

They're talking about you again.

MARGARET

What time is it?

DENIS

Sun's not quite over the yard arm.

Time for tea.

MARGARET

What have you got on your head?

DENIS

Found it in the cupboard and

thought bugger it, it's Friday,

why not fancy dress?

MARGARET

You look ridiculous.

DENIS

Bosslady no like?

MARGARET

(as if to a bad dog)

No, Denis, Bosslady no like.

JUNE (O.S)

It's taken Carol so long to get

her to agree to this. She's been

so reluctant to let his things go.

13

MARGARET

(without looking)

Feet.

JUNE (O.S)

You can never be sure she's taking

her medication...I think sometimes

she hides them..

DENIS VO

Oh, rumbled!

JUNE (O.S)

She's definitely more distracted

than usual today.

CAROL OOV

Can I suggest you remove the

sticker from the back of your car.

CAROL OOV (CONT'D)

Well then take the sticker off! I

call that false advertising! I

would say keep the change, but

there isn't any change.

CAROL OOV

Hello June, any news? I've brought

every bag I could find.

14

CAROL

Hello Ma. Bloody taxi driver.

Wouldn't take my card. I said

don't have a sticker saying you

take Visa and then insist on cash.

Can you believe it? I was

rummaging around the bottom of my

bag. He didn't get a tip.

MARGARET

I didn't know that you were

dropping by today, dear.

CAROL

(Dumping her stuff all over the

place)

Yes, you said yesterday...You

wanted to make a start on Dad's

things. The cupboards ? Then I can

help you dress.

CAROL (CONT'D)

You've got Michael and-

MARGARET

Jaqueline...

CAROL

Coming for dinner tonight.

MARGARET

Of course.

(turning up the TV)

We're having halibut.

CAROL

Oh God. Isn't it terrible?

CAROL (CONT'D)

They think it's Al Quaida -

15

MARGARET (V.O)

Denis!

DENIS

It'll be fine. Come on, get your

head down, it's ten to three, for

God's sake.

NEWS READER (V.O.)

At ten to three this morning an

explosion extensively damaged the

Grand Hotel in Brighton, scene of

the Conservative Party conference.

NEWS READER 2 (V.O.)

...Where the Prime Minister and a

number of her cabinet were

staying. They escaped unhurt -

NEWS READER 3 (V.O.)

Five people have died, many others

are injured, some critically. The

IRA have claimed responsibility.

16

MARGARET

(standing up)

We must release a statement,

offering our condolences.

CAROL

I'm sure they've already-

MARGARET

We must never, ever, ever give in

to terrorists.

CAROL

Now ma, are we going long or just

below the knee tonight?

MARGARET

Oh, below the knee I should think.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

No! Don't move those. I haven't

finished sorting them.

CAROL

I hear you went out today...You

mustn't go out on your own Mummy.

We've talked about that.

MARGARET

There was no milk.

CAROL

Call Robert he'll get it for you

if June's not up-

MARGARET

I am not for the knackers yet.

DENIS (O.S)

Now take it easy, Margaret.

17

CAROL

No one is saying that.

MARGARET

If I can't go out to buy a pint of

milk then what is the world coming

to. Really Carol, please don't

fuss about it. You've always been

like this, fuss fuss fuss. You

must find something better to do

with your time. It's most

unattractive in a woman. When I

was your age the last thing I

wanted to do was fuss around my

mother.

DENIS

Four down, 9 letters.

DENIS (CONT'D)

Something b something t something

n...something something

somthing...Refusal to change

course-

MARGARET

Obstinate.

CAROL

What?

MARGARET

Pearls. I'll wear the pearls.

18

MARGARET (CONT'D)

There they are. My little twins.

Thank you, dear.

CAROL

It's nearly all familiar faces,

William, Michael and his lovely

wife-

MARGARET

Jacqueline.

CAROL

And then there's Peter, James R

and James T and that very nice man-

MARGARET

Yes-

CAROL

- we met last year.

MARGARET

Yes I remember-

CAROL

I think he's bringing his new lady

friend just to mix it up a bit.

We're rather short on women - but

I'm sure we'll manage-

MARGARET

I've always preferred the company

of men-

CAROL

Ma?

19

GREY SUITED MAN

Ah, Miss Roberts. Hoping to be

chosen as our candidate for

parliament.

MARGARET

Well I don't like coalitions,

never have...

DENIS VO

Start on the outside...

DENIS VO

...and work your way in.

20

PORTLY HOST

...Attlee has his sights set on

the steel industry, you mark my

words.

GREY SUITED MAN

They'll be nationalizing the

bloody air next.

MALE GUEST

Yes, hold your breath, sir, that's

government property!

PORTLY HOST

So was your father a political

man, too, Miss Roberts?

MARGARET

Oh, yes, to his core. And Mayor of

Grantham.

PORTLY HOST

And a grocer as well!

MARGARET

Yes.

HOSTESS

And did you help, err, in

the...shop?

MARGARET

Oh, yes. It was a family business.

GREY SUITED MAN

A very good starting point for the

political life, I'm sure.

MARGARET

That and a degree from Oxford.

21

MARGARET

(hushed aside to

WAITER)

Whisky.

MARGARET

What I do think is that a man

should be encouraged to stand on

his own two feet. Yes we help

people of course we help people.

But for those that can do, they

must just get up and do. And if

something's wrong, they shouldn't

just whine about it, they should

get in there and DO something

about it, change things.

PORTLY HOST

With all due respect, Miss

Roberts, what may have served in

Grantham-

MARGARET

Can serve very well for the people

of Dartford too.

MALE GUEST

Really?

MARGARET

I know much more than those who

have never lived on a limited

income. Just like the man or woman

on the street, when I am short one

week, I have to make economies the

next.

GREY SUITED MAN

Nothing like a slice of fiscal

responsibility.

22

MARGARET

A man might call it fiscal

responsibility, a woman might call

it good housekeeping.

MALE GUEST

I'm not sure a home economics

lesson is quite what the Dartford

constituents need. They see

industry being nationalized, the

unions on the up, the pound on the

slide...whoever can sort that lot

out - he's my man.

MARGARET

Or woman?

HOSTESS

Ladies shall we ?

PORTLY HOST

Miss Roberts, do join the ladies.

PORTLY HOST (O.S.)

Well. That's told us!

MICHAEL

So, Margaret, how would you have

dealt with this if you'd been

Prime Minister?

23

MARGARET

Where?

CAROL

The bombings, mummy. Today?

CAROL (CONT'D)

We were just talking about them?

MARGARET

No, uhm, yes - we have always

lived alongside evil. But it has

never been so patient, so avid for

carnage, so eager to carry

innocents with it into oblivion.

MALE GUEST

So, would you -

MARGARET

Western civilization must root out

this evil, wherever it hides, or

she risks defeat at the hands of

global terror in a nuclear age.

Unimaginable!

PETER

The Prime Minister gave a very

good statement I thought.

MARGARET

Yes. Clever man. Quite a smoothie.

MARGARET

You don't mind if I sit down...

24

FEMALE GUEST

I heard you speak at conference in

1984 in Brighton just after the

IRA bombed the Grand Hotel. You

were remarkable. I hope you

appreciate what an inspiration you

have been for women like myself.

MARGARET

It used to be about trying to do

something. Now its about trying to

be someone.

FEMALE GUEST

Well anyway, I...thank you.

MARGARET

Good night to you.

CAROL (O.S.)

Great to see you, thank you very

much for coming.

MALE GUEST (O.S.)

Oh, thank you. It was lovely,

absolutely lovely. And I'm so

pleased to see your mother looking

so well.

CAROL

OK...hold on to me...that's right.

25

MARGARET

Can you do the clasp, I can't

quite -

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Thank you.

CAROL

You've got an eyelash.

CAROL (CONT'D)

Make a wish.

CAROL (CONT'D)

I spoke to Doctor Michael today-

CAROL (CONT'D)

He is very good and very expensive-

CAROL (CONT'D)

...I know you're not due to see

him for another month but I've

spoken to him and he can fit you

in tomorrow.

CAROL (CONT'D)

Just for a check up.

(silence)

Ma please-

MARGARET

What does Mark think about it?

CAROL

Mark?

26

MARGARET

Yes. Tell him to come up. I want

to talk to him about it.

CAROL

Mark's with Sarah and the

children.

MARGARET

Well tell him to come up and see

me after he's kissed them good

night, would you Carol darling?

CAROL

He's not here Mummy.

CAROL (CONT'D)

Mark lives in South Africa...

CAROL (CONT'D)

...you are not Prime Minister

anymore and Dad is...Dad is dead-

MARGARET

You look exhausted, dear. You

really must try to get some sleep.

Taxis'll be few and far between at

this hour...

CAROL

Righty-ho. Night night Ma. Sleep

well.

MARGARET

Good night, dear.

27

RADIO ANNOUNCER

Twenty-four-year-old Miss Margaret

Roberts lost her bid to win a seat

in Parliament today, but she has

put new life into the Dartford

Conservative Association. Winning

candidate Mr Dodds had better

watch out, this bright young woman

is on his tail.

DENIS

Eat!

MARGARET

Disaster.

DENIS

Hang on...Hang on...Hang on...

DENIS (CONT'D)

You shaved thousands off their

majority. You did splendidly.

MARGARET

Not splendidly enough.

28

DENIS

Ah I see. Self pity.

DENIS (CONT'D)

No one is saying you don't need a

safe seat. You deserve a safe

seat. But it does not come unless

you learn to play the game a

little.

MARGARET

What game?

DENIS

You are a grocer's daughter-

MARGARET

(fiercely)

-And proud of being-

DENIS

- in their eyes. A single grocer's

daughter. But if you were to

become the wife of a moderately

successful businessman-

DENIS (CONT'D)

You'd get to parliament, and I'd

get to be the happiest man in- in

wherever they select you.

(SILENCE)

Margaret, will you marry me?

DENIS (CONT'D)

Well ?

MARGARET

Yes. Yes!

DENIS

What ?

29

MARGARET

I love you so much but...I will

never be one of those women Denis -

who stays silent and pretty on the

arm of her husband. Or remote and

alone in the kitchen doing the

washing up for that matter.

DENIS

(trying to retain the

moment)

We'll get a help for that.

MARGARET

No - one's life must matter,

Denis. Beyond the cooking and the

cleaning and the children, one's

life must mean more than that - I

cannot die washing up a tea cup.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

I mean it Denis, say you

understand.

DENIS

That's why I want to marry you, my

dear.

DENIS (CONT'D)

Now eat.

30

MARGARET

There they are, my little twins.

Mark...

DENIS

Cornwall, wasn't it? Bloody

hell... Look at `em, little imps.

You never really got golf, did

you?

MARGARET

You look happy.

DENIS

Yes, I do, don't I? You're

drinking too much.

DENIS (CONT'D)

Whatcha doing?

31

DENIS (CONT'D)

Not like you. Looking back.

DENIS (CONT'D)

Don't want to dig around too deep,

M. Don't know what you might find.

DENIS (CONT'D)

You can rewind it, but you can't

change it.

MARGARET

They grow up so fast.

MARGARET

Mark.

SPEAKER VO

Mr Eric Deakins, Labour...

13,437...

30

MARGARET

There they are, my little twins.

Mark...

DENIS

Cornwall, wasn't it? Bloody

hell... Look at `em, little imps.

You never really got golf, did

you?

MARGARET

You look happy.

DENIS

Yes, I do, don't I? You're

drinking too much.

DENIS (CONT'D)

Whatcha doing?

33

AIREY NEAVE

Mrs Thatcher ! Airey Neave.

Welcome to the madhouse. Follow

me.

34

SPEAKER

The Right Honourable Lady the

Secretary of State for Education.

MARGARET

The right honourable gentleman

knows that we have no choice but

to shut down the schools!

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Because his union paymasters have

called a strike deliberately to

cripple our economy. Teachers

cannot teach when there is no

heating, no lighting in their

classrooms. And I ask the

honourable gentleman, whose fault

is that?

SHADOW MINISTER

Methinks the Right Honourable lady

doth screech to much. If she wants

us to take her seriously she must

learn to calm down!

MARGARET

If the right honorable gentleman

could perhaps attend more closely

to WHAT I am saying, rather than

HOW I am saying it, he may receive

a valuable education in spite of

himself!

SHADOW MINISTER

Why has this Conservative

government failed? Why has it

forced so many in the public

sector into taking strike action

to save their own jobs?

35

SHADOW MINISTER VO

Minister, the breakdown of

essential public services -

transport, electricity, sanitation

is not the fault of the trades

unions but of this Conservative

government in which you so

shamefully serve!

HEATH

So these power cuts will continue

unless we can reach a compromise.

HEATH (CONT'D)

The miners are asking for a 35%

increase in wages. Obviously we

can't go anywhere near that. The

unions are not our enemies and

never have been. We want - and

have always wanted - the broadest

consensus...

HEATH (CONT'D)

I'm sure we are all in agreement

that we must do nothing for the

moment that will further inflame

the current situation.

MINISTER 1

Hear hear, Prime Minister.

36

HEATH

- the fact of the matter is, it's

absolutely crucial that we are

seen by the public to be acting as

conciliators and not aggressors.

(Finally

acknowledging

Margaret)

Yes, Education Secretary.

MARGARET

Yes...

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Prime Minister, with the Miners'

leader calling today for the army

to mutiny in support of the

strikes, this seems the wrong time

for conciliation.

HEATH

Be patient. They'll come back on

in a minute.

HEATH (CONT'D)

Thank you, Margaret.

HEATH (CONT'D)

Your thoughts are duly noted.

ALFRED (O.S.)

We on this island are strong.

We're self-reliant. Napoleon

called us a nation of shopkeepers.

37

ALFRED

He meant it as an insult but to me

it's a compliment. That's why he

couldn't beat us, and that's why

Hitler can't beat us.

ALFRED (CONT'D)

We Conservatives believe in giving

people the freedom and opportunity

to fulfil their own potential,

especially the young. There's no

good in pretending we're all

equal, we're not all the same,

never have been, never will be. We

should encourage our children to

aspire to achieve more than we

have, for our children today will

be the leaders of tomorrow.

VOICE ON THE RADIO

It's 1974 and you'd think it was

WWII. Blackouts, no petrol. It's a

mess. Heath should resign now and

make way for someone who's not

afraid to tackle the unions.

CAROL

I swear, it's all gone completely

out of my head. My driving

instructor thinks I should pass

but I feel as if I've hardly had

any lessons. Ridiculous isn't it?

Maybe third time lucky.

MARGARET

Right. The only thing you should

remember is that everyone else is

either reckless or inept. And

often both.

38

MARGARET (CONT'D)

One must be brave if one is to

take the wheel-

CAROL

Right-o.

MARGARET

Move over... Move to your right a

little bit...

CAROL

But if I move to the right aren't

I on the wrong side of the road?

MARGARET

Carol!

CAROL

Well he's in the way!

MARGARET

To the right. Move to the right!

MARGARET (CONT'D)

So sorry! Terribly sorry!

CAROL

Hey, look at me, driving!

CAROL

Thanks Ma, that was terrific! I

really feel I've got a handle on

it now.

CAROL (CONT'D)

You should have seen us, Pa.

39

MARGARET

Have you been trying to make

breakfast? For Goodness sake,

Denis!

DENIS

I can boil a bloody egg.

CAROL

Mummy took me for a test drive -

We went absolutely everywhere. All

over the place -

MARGARET

(sudden/cutting in)

I've decided. I'm going to run.

DENIS

What for?

MARGARET

I'm going to run for Leader of the

Party.

CAROL

Silly me!

DENIS

(calling after)

Good luck!

CAROL (O.S.)

All the time I thought I was

having a driving lesson, it was

all about my mother, just for a

change!

MARGARET

What's she on about?

DENIS

It's her driving test this

morning!

40

MARGARET

Oh, right. Of course.

DENIS

Are you saying you want to be

Prime Minister?

MARGARET

(with false patience)

What I'm saying is that someone

must force the point, say the

unsayable. None of these men have

the guts.

DENIS

The Prime Minister has been very

loyal to you, MT.

MARGARET

But he's weak, and he's weakened

the party. One must know when to

go.

(glancing at him)

You're shaking.

DENIS

I can do it!

MARGARET

Goodness me! What is the matter

with everyone this morning?

DENIS

I've told you what the matter is.

The business is a bit rocky at the

moment and the Doctor thinks I

need a rest.

MARGARET

And do you need a rest?

41

MARGARET (CONT'D)

We both know that it's highly

unlikely that I would ever be

elected leader, I'll never be

elected leader. But I will run. I

will run. Just to nip at their

heels and make them reaffirm the

principles on which the

Conservative Party must stand.

There's so much to do.

DENIS

(sotto voce)

You're insufferable, Margaret, do

you know that?

MARGARET

Denis, you married someone who is

committed to public service, you

knew that. And it is my duty -

DENIS

(interrupts)

Don't call it duty. It's ambition

which has got you this far.

Ambition. And the rest of us, me,

the children, we can all go to

hell!

DENIS (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Don't worry about me, I'll be

fine!

MARGARET

Where did you go?

DENIS

South Africa.

MARGARET

Yes.

42

DENIS (V.O.)

How many days passed before you

realized I was gone? Probably had

to ask the cleaning woman where I

was.

MARGARET

When did I lose track of everyone?

DENIS

Too busy climbing the greasy pole

MT.

INTERVIEWER (O.S.)

Mrs Thatcher I understand you

recently visited the United States

of America.

INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)

What was it you took away from

that visit which may be of value

here in Great Britain?

MARGARET

Oh that's rather easy to answer,

actually. They are unafraid of

success.

43

MARGARET ON TELEVISION

We in Great Britain and in Europe

are formed mainly by our history.

They on the other hand are formed

by their philosophy. Not by what

has been, but by what can be. Oh,

we have a great deal that we can

learn from them, yes. Oh yes!

REECE

Well er...For a start, that hat

has got to go. And the pearls. In

fact I think all hats may have to

go. You look and sound like a

privileged Conservative wife and

we've already got her vote. You've

got lovely hair but we need to do

something with it - to make it

more-

AIREY NEAVE

Important.

REECE

Yes. Give it more impact. But the

main thing is your voice. Its too

high. It has no authority.

AIREY NEAVE

Methinks the Lady doth screech too

much

REECE

People don't want to be harangued

by a woman or hectored. Persuaded

yes. That `oh yes' at the end of

the interview, that's

authoritative, that's the voice of

a leader.

44

MARGARET

It's all very well to talk about

changing my voice, Mr Reece, but

for some of my colleagues to

imagine me as their leader would

be like imagining, I don't know,

being led into battle by their

chambermaid. It's my background,

and my sex. No matter how I've

tried, and I have tried, to fit

in, I will never be truly one of

them.

REECE

If I may say so - I think that's

your trump card. You're flying in

the face of everything the Tories

have been thus far. It's really

very exciting. One simply has to

maximise your appeal, bring out

all your qualities and make you

look, and sound, like the leader

that you could be.

NEAVE

You've got it in you to go the

whole distance.

REECE

Absolutely.

MARGARET

Prime Minister?! Oh no. Oh no no

no. In Britain? There will be no

female Prime Minister here, not in

my lifetime. No. And I told Airey,

I don't expect to win the

leadership, but I am going to run.

Just to shake up the party.

NEAVE

Respectfully, Margaret, I

disagree. If you want to change

this party, lead it. If you want

to change the country, lead it.

What we're talking about here

today is surface. What's crucial

is that you hold your course, and

stay true to who you are. Never be

anything other than yourself.

45

REECE

Leave us to do the rest.

MARGARET

Gentlemen, I am in your hands. I

may be persuaded to surrender the

hat. But the pearls were a gift

from my husband on the birth of

our twins and they are absolutely

non-negotiable.

THEATRICAL VOICE COACH

And...bring it down.

MARGARET

Maaaaaaaaaaaa.

THEATRICAL VOICE COACH

Good, I think we can loose the

handbag, Mrs Thatcher...Hands down

the sides...Because this isn't

really about the voice, it's about

belief...A nice deep breath.

THEATRICAL VOICE COACH (CONT'D)

If you're calling Mr Thatcher, how

would you do that?

MARGARET

(calls)

Denis.

THEATRICAL VOICE COACH

Yes, I want more authority, I want

conviction, I want -

46

MARGARET

(a little more

authority)

Denis.

THEATRICAL VOICE COACH

That's right, one more time, deep

breath -

MARGARET

Denis.

DENIS

Yes MT!

MARGARET

You are the backbone of our

nation! Small firms like Loveday's

Ice Cream. How are you? So nice to

meet you ladies.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

I'll just have a small one,

because I'm watching my figure.

(handing the cone

out)

That's for you young man!

MARGARET (V.O.)

I passionately believe it's the

growth of small businesses into

larger ones that is critical for

Britain's future.

47

MARGARET

It has to be something icy on a

stick for Denis.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

(returning to her subject)

That's the only way we will

produce jobs, real jobs, jobs that

sustain.

MARGARET

The Trade Union Movement was

founded to protect workers. Now it

persecutes them. It stops them

from working. It is killing jobs

and it is bringing this country to

its knees. I say enough. It's time

to get up. It's time to go to

work. It's time to put the Great

back into Great Britain!

Oh, thanks Airey. Goodnight.

socialism and restore to greatness

this country that we love so much.

And the only way is for the

This is it, steady the buffs old

MARGARET

I should just like to say that I

take very seriously the trust the

British people placed in me today,

and I will work hard every day to

live up to that responsibility.

And now, I should like to share

with you a prayer of St Francis of

Assisi: Where there is discord may

we bring harmony... Where there is

error may we bring truth... Where

there is doubt may we bring

faith... Where there is despair

may we bring hope..

MARGARET

Shoulders back, tummies in!

52

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Oh. Thank you, Michael.

MARGARET

I'm perfectly healthy. There's no

need for any of this.

DENIS

Just let them look under the

bonnet, MT. Check everything is

hunky dory.

MARGARET

Really it's becoming quite

tiresome.

DENIS

What is?

MARGARET

You.

(beat)

I was on my own for twenty four

years before I met you and I can

manage perfectly well without you

now. So will you please go away

and stop bothering me.

DOCTOR

Just look straight at me, straight

ahead, that's it.

53

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

Are you noticing night sweats?

MARGARET

No

DOCTOR

Hallucinations?

MARGARET

No.

DOCTOR

Sleep?

MARGARET

Yes, I sleep. Four, five hours a

night.

DOCTOR

So you wake early?

MARGARET

And I stay up late. I always have.

DOCTOR

We just want to keep abreast of

it.

MARGARET

Yes. Of course.

DOCTOR

Grief is a very natural state.

MARGARET

My husband has been gone for

years. Cancer.

DOCTOR

Carol says you've decided to let

his things go. Probably a good

thing.

MARGARET

Yes. It was my idea. To Oxfam.

Perfectly good stuff. People can

use these things.

54

DOCTOR

Still it must be a bit

disorientating. You are bound to

be feeling.

MARGARET

What? What am I `bound to be

feeling'?

MARGARET (CONT'D)

People don't `think' any more.

They `feel'. `How are you

feeling?' `Oh I don't feel

comfortable with that' `Oh, I'm so

sorry but we, the group were

feeling...' D'you know, one of the

great problems of our age is that

we are governed by people who care

more about feelings than thoughts

and ideas.

(beat)

Now thoughts and ideas. That

interests me.

(beat)

Ask me what I am thinking-

DOCTOR

What are you thinking, Margaret?

MARGARET

Watch your thoughts, for they

become words. Watch your words,

for they become actions. Watch

your actions, for they become

habits. Watch your habits, for

they become your character. And

watch your character, for it

becomes your destiny. What we

think, we become. My father always

said that.

(beat)

And I think I am fine.

(beat)

But I do so appreciate your kind

concern.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Oh, do please answer that.

What about that medicine man, eh?

Ah. Cold supper. Standards are

like the old days! Hallucinations

my eye!

DENIS (CONT'D)

How dare he?

DENIS (CONT'D)

But then you give us all the run

I know you can hear me,

Enough. Denis, enough!

DENIS

Dismissed!

DENIS (CONT'D)

I don't know why you're being so

scratchy.

DENIS (CONT'D)

It's not as if you've got anyone

else to talk to.

MARGARET (V.O.)

When the Himalayan peasant meets

the he-bear in his pride -

57

DENIS

You know, it's a marvel to me that

you can still quote huge chunks of

Kipling but try remembering the

name of that woman who's just made

you that godawful cold

collation... No? Come on... you

can do it... month of the year...

one syllable... rhymes with moon

MARGARET

(sudden/like a

lightbulb)

June.

DENIS

June! Bingo. Knew you'd get there

in the end. "When the Himalayan

peasant meets the he-bear in his

pride, He shouts to scare the

monster, who will often turn

aside, but the she-bear thus

accosted rends the peasant tooth

and nail. For the female of the

species is more deadly than the

male..."

MARGARET

If I can't hear you then I can't

see you. And if I can't see you

then you are not here.

58

MARGARET (CONT'D)

And if you are not here, I am not

going mad. I will not...I will not

go mad.

BBC VOICEOVER

Baroness Thatcher made an

apparently routine visit to her

doctor today. Although rarely

seen in public, Lady Thatcher, the

the twentieth century, remains a

controversial figure.

JUNE

Margaret-

BBC VOICE OVER

Almost lovingly dubbed by the

Soviets The Iron Lady, she's also

credited, with her friend Ronald

Reagan, with a decisive role in

the ending of the Cold War. Her

supporters claim she transformed

the country's post-war decline.

Her detractors blame her savage

public spending cuts and sweeping

privatization of -

DENIS (O.S.)

Am I out of the doghouse yet?

MARGARET

They're unveiling that portrait of

me at Number 10 next month. The

invitation's on the mantelpiece.

So there'll be Churchill, Lloyd

George and me. Just the three of

us.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

I said I didn't want any big fuss

but they insisted..

Lovely little article in The

Telegraph... The Woman Who Changed

the Face of History..

FOOT VO

Less than two years ago, the Prime

Minister quoted St. Francis and

talked about bringing faith, hope

Can the Right Honourable Lady

the highest level of unemployment

since 1934-

FOOT (CONT'D)

The biggest fall in total output

in steel and coal production in

one year since 1931. And the

HESELTINE

May we have a word, Prime

Minister?

MARGARET

Yes, but in order to arrive at the

palace on time, Geoffrey and I are

will be walking out of that door

in 15 minutes. As you can see -

HESELTINE

I know you're running late

Margaret, but we have to address

this situation in light of

tomorrow's blistering press

coverage. Blistering! The knives

are out. Your draft budget's been

leaked, Geoffrey, they are baying

for our blood!

HOWE

Michael we can't possibly buckle

at the first sign of difficulty.

HESELTINE

No one is saying we have to

buckle.

PRIOR

But is this really the time to

make these spending cuts in the

middle of one of the deepest

recessions this country has ever

experienced?

HESTLETINE

We need a plan of action,

Margaret.

PYM

Absolutely. A strategy.

62

GILMOUR

We must be armed.

PRIOR

Agreed.

PRIOR (CONT'D)

There's a perception, Margaret

rightly or wrongly, that we are

now completely out of touch with

the country.

MARGARET

Really.

(beat)

How much is a pack of Lurpak?

PYM

Lurpak?

MARGARET

Butter, Francis.

(silence)

Forty two pence. Anchor butter is

forty pence. Flora margarine,

still the cheapest, is thirty

eight pence. I can assure you I am

not out of touch.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

What - did you say?

GILMOUR

Nothing. Nothing, Prime Minister.

63

MARGARET

Don't try to hide you opinions.

Goodness me, I'd much rather you

were honest and straightforward

about them - instead of

continuously and damagingly

leaking them to the press. Well?

PYM

Well, people can't pay their

mortgages.

GILMOUR

The manufacturing industry is

practically on its knees.

PYM

Honest, hard-working, decent

people are losing their homes.

It's terribly shameful.

GILMOUR

The point is, Prime Minister, that

we must moderate the pace -

HESELTINE

- if we're even to have a hope of

winning the next election-

PYM

Quite right.

MARGARET

Ah. Worried about our careers, are

we?

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Gentlemen, if we don't cut

spending we will be bankrupt. Yes

the medicine is harsh but the

patient requires it in order to

live. Shall we withhold the

medicine? No! We are not wrong. We

did not seek election and win in

order to manage the decline of a

great nation.

(MORE)

64

MARGARET (CONT'D)

The people of this country chose

us because they believe we can

restore the health of the British

economy and we will do just that!

Barring a failure of nerve.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Anything else?

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Thank you. You saved the day once

again, Crawfie, you're an angel.

HOWE

You can't close down a discussion

because it's not what you wish to

hear.

MARGARET

I don't expect everyone just to

sit there and agree with me. But

what kind of leader am I if I

don't try to get my own way - to

do what I know to be right.

HOWE

Yes. But Margaret, one must be

careful of testing one's

colleagues' loyalty too far.

The Falkland islands, the British

as a spearhead to capture key

Gentlemen, the Argentinian Junta -

which is a fascist gang - has

invaded our sovereign territory.

This cannot be tolerated. May I

make plain my negotiating

position. I will not negotiate

with criminals or thugs. The

Falkland islands belong to

Britain, and I want them back.

Gentlemen, I need you to tell me

today if that is possible.

ADMIRAL LEACH

Possible... just, Prime Minister.

We can have a Task Force ready to

sail in forty-eight hours.

MARGARET

Forty-eight hours?

ADMIRAL LEACH

But -

MARGARET

But?

ADMIRAL LEACH

We have a very narrow weather

window. We can't fight in winter

down there. Nobody can. If we are

going, we have to go now.

MARGARET

Why were the islands left without

any naval protection?

JOHN NOTT

In the last round of Defence cuts

we judged the risk of invasion to

be small.

MARGARET

Did we?

JOHN NOTT

And if you remember, Prime

Minister, you agreed that we

should reduce the naval presence

in the area to an absolute

minimum.

71

HOWE

Margaret, the cost of sending

28,000 men and a hundred ships

twelve thousand miles, almost to

Argentina, will be absolutely

crippling.

MARGARET

I don't think we should be

worrying about money at this

point, Geoffrey.

GEOFFREY HOWE

We can't afford to go to war.

ADMIRAL LEACH (V.O.)

We have to go now.

MARGARET (V.O.)

The government has now decided

that a large task force will sail,

as soon as all preparations are

complete.

MP 1 (O.S.)

Prime Minister we do still have

three weeks before our ships reach

the islands.

MP 2 (O.S.)

All we're saying is that we

shouldn't give up on trying to

find a diplomatic solution.

72

MP 1

The U.S. Secretary of State has

arrived, Prime Minister.

GENERAL HAIG

So you are proposing to go to war

over these Islands. They're

thousands of miles away, a handful

of citizens, politically and

economically... insignificant, if

you'll excuse me -

MARGARET

Just like Hawaii, I imagine.

GENERAL HAIG

I'm sorry?

MARGARET

1941, when Japan attacked Pearl

Harbour. Did America go cap in

hand and ask Tojo for a peaceful

negotiation of terms? Did she turn

her back on her own citizens there

because the islands were thousands

of miles from mainland United

States? No, no, no! We will stand

on principle or we shall not stand

at all.

GENERAL HAIG

But Margaret with all due respect

when one has been to war....

MARGARET

With all due respect sir, I have

done battle every single day of my

life, and many men have

underestimated me before. This lot

seem bound to do the same but they

will rue the day.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Now, shall I be mother?

73

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Tea, Al, how do you take your tea?

Black or white?

NAVAL ATTACHE 1

The Argentinian ship the General

Belgrano and her escorts are

pursuing course 273 degrees toward

the Argentinian mainland. We are

tracking it with our submarine HMS

Conqueror.

MARGARET

Is this ship a threat?

ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE

Both of these ships are carrying

Exocet missiles, Prime Minister.

Just yesterday they launched- then

aborted- an attack inside the

exclusion zone. There is a risk

they could try it again.

FRANCIS PYM

The Belgrano is sailing directly

away from the islands. Can it

really be regarded as a threat ?

ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE

She's been changing course

continually. There's a strong

possibility that they're

attempting a pincer movement on

our carrier group.

(MORE)

74

ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE (CONT'D)

I advise that we engage them: hit

the Belgrano as a warning to the

others. Send them all back to

port.

FRANCIS PYM

It'll play badly internationally.

We'll be seen as aggressors.

JOHN NOTT

This will be an escalation, Prime

Minister.

LEACH

If there is to be an escalation,

it's better that we start it.

It is steaming away, Prime

Minister.

MARGARET

Sink it.

TV JOURNALIST V.O.

... HMS Sheffield, a Type 42

destroyer, was attacked and hit

they have enough missiles to

cripple most of our fleet.

JOHN NOTT

President Reagan and President

Bellaunde of Peru have some new

proposals for the peace plan -

MARGARET

(sharply)

The peace plan? There will be no

appeasement. This is a war. A war

they started and by God, we will

finish. Shall I tell you what I'm

going to write to every single one

of these families, these

heartbroken families? I am going

to tell them that no British

soldier will die in vain for the

Falklands.

Shortly after dark last night, our

streaming back into Port Stanley.

Our forces are moving forward to

exploit their success.

DENIS O/S

Well done, M.

78

MARGARET O/S

We congratulate the men and women

of the armed Forces for their

skill, bravery and loyalty to this

MARGARET

We were faced with an act of

unprovoked aggression and we

responded as we have responded in

times past: with unity, strength

and courage, sure in the knowledge

that though much is sacrificed, in

the end, right will prevail over

wrong.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

And I put it to the Honourable

Member opposite that this is not a

day for him to carp, find fault,

demand inquiries- they will happen

I can assure him of that for we

have nothing to hide- no, this is

a day to put difference aside,

hold one's head high and take

pride in being British.

DENIS

GOTCHA! Well that paid off old

girl! Your ratings soared! From

the most hated Prime Minister of

all time to the nation's

darling...The world was at your

feet, and Britain was back in

business!

the European single currency will

come up.

I don't think the country is ready

for it yet.

GEOFFREY HOWE

But we cannot bury our heads in

the sand...

NEWS JOURNALIST (V.O.)

A lot of Conservative MP's and

Ministers are saying -

NEWS JOURNALIST

- that there must be a change in

that style of management. That Mrs

Thatcher must listen more, and on

occasion, give in.

PYM (O.S.)

The point is, Prime Minister, I

don't think we can sell the idea

of a tax that asks everyone to pay

the same.

MARGARET (V.O.)

Our policies may be unpopular, but

they are the right policies.

MINISTER 1 (V.O.)

Prime Minister I just don't think

we can ask the poorest of the poor

to pay the same amount of tax as a

multi-millionaire.

MARGARET

There it is again! Why not?

81

MINISTER 1

Because -

MINISTER 2

Because people... on the whole...

think that the tax is manifestly

unfair.

MARGARET

Nonsense. Arrant nonsense. This

is a simple proposition. In order

to live in this country, you must

pay for the privilege- something,

anything! If you pay nothing, you

care nothing. What do you care

where you throw your rubbish? Your

council estate is a mess, your

town, graffiti, what do you care?

It's not your problem , it's

somebody else's problem- it's the

government's problem! YOUR problem

is, some of you, is that you

haven't got the courage for this

fight. You haven't had to fight

hard for anything. It's all been

given to you- and you feel guilty

about it! Well, may I say, on

behalf of all those who HAVE had

to fight their way up, (and who

don't feel guilty about it) we

resent those slackers who take,

take, take, and contribute nothing

to the community!

MARGARET (CONT'D)

And I see the same thing, the same

cowardice in our fight within the

European Union, to retain British

sovereignty of Britain, the

integrity of the pound! Some of

you want to make concessions. I

hear some of you agree with the

latest French proposals.

(beat)

Well, why don't you get on a boat

to Calais? Yes, why don't you put

on a beret, and pay 85% of your

income to the French government!

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Right. What can we realistically

hope to achieve by the end of

session, Lord President?

(MORE)

82

MARGARET (CONT'D)

And why have we not made more

progress to date? What is that? Is

that the timetable? I haven't seen

that. May I see it?

HOWE

Here it is, Prime Minister. Of

course.

MARGARET

The wording is sloppy here, and

here.

HOWE

If you say so.

MARGARET

I do say so.

HOWE

It's merely a first draft...

MARGARET

This is ridiculous. There are two

"T's" in "committee"!

MARGARET (CONT'D)

This is shameful. Shameful! I

can't even rely on you for a

simple timetable! Are you unwell?

Yes you are unwell. Give me the

pencil, give it to me!

MARGARET (CONT'D)

If this is the best you can do I

had better send you to hospital,

and I shall do your job as well as

my own and everyone else's.

Gentlemen.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

As the Lord President has come to

cabinet unprepared, I am obliged

to close this meeting.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Good morning!

ANGRY CROWD

(chanting)

Can't pay, won't pay! Can't pay,

won't pay! Can't pay, won't pay!

PROTESTORS

Out... Out... Out...

PROTESTORS

Maggie... Maggie... Maggie. Out...

out... out.

MARGARET

Geoffrey-

GEOFFREY

My letter of resignation.

GEOFFREY HOWE

Our differences, I'm afraid,

cannot be reconciled.

HOWE

I have done what I believe to be

right for my party and my country.

The time has come for others to

consider their own response to the

tragic conflict of loyalties with

which I have myself wrestled for

perhaps too long.

85

MINISTER 1 (O.S.)

Geoffrey's speech in the House of

Commons was devastating.

MINSTER 2 (O.S.)

- just couldn't take any more of

the bullying.

MINISTER 3 (O.S.)

He was almost inviting someone to

challenge her for leadership of

the party.

MINISTER 4 (O.S.)

She behaved appallingly. I

wouldn't have spoken to my

gamekeeper like that.

MINISTER 1 (O.S.)

I don't think she can survive

this.

HESELTINE ON TV

I'm here to announce my decision

to put my name forward as leader

of the Conservative party. I have

nothing but admiration for our

Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher,

but I believe our party and our

country need a new leader.

86

TV JOURNALIST

It's extraordinary. The rules of

the Conservative Party make it

possible for Conservative MP's to

depose a sitting Prime Minister.

MARGARET

I am the Prime Minister.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

(offering the packet)

Sweetie?

NEWS JOURNALIST (O.S.)

As Conservative MP's gather in

Westminster to discus who they

will back in the leadership

contest, the Prime Minister said

she would not be diverted from

critical international affairs

TREVOR MACDONALD

Tonight in Paris Mrs Thatcher is

among thirty four world leaders

who came together to celebrate the

end of the Cold War and herald the

start of a peaceful new age of

East/West cooperation.

87

NEWS JOURNALIST

There's a general feeling that Mrs

Thatcher is going to win on the

first ballot. We're going to put

it to bed tomorrow night, is how

one of her campaign staff puts it.

DENIS ON PHONE

M, I really think you should come

home and defend yourself old girl.

Heseltine is campaigning

ferociously.

MARGARET ON PHONE OOV

I do think my time is best spent

seeing an end to the Cold War,

don't you? After all this time

they know what I stand for.

TREVOR MACDONALD

Will she, or will she not, be in

the job tomorrow?

HEAD OF STATE 1

Margaret, they can't touch you.

NEWS READER (O.S.)

Mrs Thatcher has failed to win

enough votes to secure an outright

win in the leadership contest and

must now decide whether to put her

name forward for the second round.

NEWS READER 2

As Mrs Thatcher leaves Paris for

London to make a last ditch

attempt to pull together support

for her leadership, the ship may

have sailed.

88

MARGARET

Treachery!

MINISTER 1

We will never win another election

led by that woman.

MINISTER 2

We need a leader who listens.

MINISTER 3

This isn't about her, it's about

the party.

MINISTER 4

One must know when to go.

MINISTER 1

The question is, how does anyone

put it to her?

MINISTER

If you were to stand, I of course

would vote for you Prime Minister

-

MINISTER 2

- of course would vote for you

Prime Minister but I don't think

you can win. The loyalty of my

colleagues cannot be counted upon.

MARGARET

It was the people who put me here -

MINISTER 3

The loyalty of my colleagues

cannot be counted upon.

89

MARGARET

- it's up to them to tell me when

to go.

DENIS

Margaret, you can't let them do

this to you. Please, boss.

DENIS (CONT'D)

They'll destroy you.

DENIS (CONT'D)

Throw in the towel now, love.

Don't let those bastards see you

humiliated. You just won't win,

darling. Not this time.

MARGARET

Oh Denis.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

154                  I am the Prime Minister.                       154

SPEAKER (V.O.)

Order! Order!

MARGARET (V.O.)

The Right Honourable gentleman is

afraid!

NORTHERN VOICE (V.O.)

This is a naked strategy of

closing some coal mines and then

selling off -

90

MARGARET (V.O.)

They believe in striking, I

believe in working!

IRISH VOICE (V.O.)

This is the woman who's watched

ten men on hunger strike starve

themselves to death and never

flinched!

MARGARET (V.O.)

Despicable and cowardly -

MALE VOICE (V.O.)

Cynical Falklands war -

MINISTER (V.O.)

More homeowners, more

shareholders, more savings -

MARGARET (V.O.)

I offer my resignation after

eleven and a half extraordinary

years -

MARGARET

-proud to have left Britain in a

much better state than when we

took office.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

What's this then? A radio... How

useful.

91

DENIS

Steady, MT.

DENIS (O.S.)

The greatest Prime Minister since

Churchill deposed by a bunch of

spineless pygmies!

MARGARET VO

All those years of taking the

tough decisions, does any of it

matter now?

DENIS

It's all been turned to mush!

MARGARET

What?

DENIS

By these fools! These lily-livered

pinkos!

MARGARET

These inept placators.

DENIS

Very good! These vacillators.

MARGARET

Vacillators! Poll takers.

DENIS

Popularity seekers.

MARGARET

So busy taking the pulse of the

public!

DENIS

Weak -

92

MARGARET

(pulling down a rack of Denis's

black oxford shoes onto the floor)

These...weak...weak...weak...wea..

.weak...Men!

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Don't they know if you take the

tough decisions, yes people will

hate you today but they'll thank

you for generations.

DENIS

Or forget you entirely and chuck

you out with the rubbish!

MARGARET V/O

(seizing shirts and

jerseys and putting

them on the floor)

All I wanted was to make a

difference in the world.

DENIS

And you did, love, you did.

MARGARET V/O

All I wanted was for my children

to grow up well and be happy -

happier than I was certainly. And

I wanted you to be happy of

course. Were you happy, Denis?

Tell me the truth.

93

MARGARET

Denis? Denis?

MARGARET V/O

Here's your bag. You're all

packed, sorted.

MARGARET

(seeing he is walking away in his

socks)

Denis wait...Where are your shoes?

You can't go without shoes! Not

yet.

DENIS

Steady.

MARGARET

Yes...Steady...

DENIS

Steady the buffs -

MARGARET

Steady...Steady the buffs...

MARGARET (CONT'D)

154d                 NO...Not yet...Denis. Wait...I              154d

said I don't want you to go yet.

94

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Denis...Please...No...Not...Don't.

..NO...I don't...I don't want to

be on my own.

DENIS

You're going to be fine on your

own, love.

(beat)

You always have been.

MARGARET

(calling out)

Denis!!

CAROL OOV

Mummy-

CAROL

My God, Mum. Are you alright?

(opening the

curtains)

Mummy you should have called for

help, silly old sausage. Have you

not even been in your bed

properly? You've done all this?

MARGARET

Yes, all sorted. Finished.

CAROL

Yes well don't worry about all

this. June and I will crack on

with it.

MARGARET

I was just going to get dressed.

95

CAROL

...Shall I call someone, see if

anyone can come over and do your

hair?

MARGARET

Oh. No, you do it.

CAROL OOV

Right, I'm off June.

JUNE

OK. `Bye.

JUNE (O.S) (CONT'D)

Oh let me do that, Margaret.

MARGARET

No, dear, I'll do it.

JUNE

Carol said you might go to the

House of Lords today?

MARGARET

No no. I'm not going anywhere.
