a screenplay by

David Mamet

SCOTT

(quietly)

...you better catch her...

SCOTT

...your Dad's napping on the

sofa, your Mom's watching Let's

Make A Deal, and God is Dead.

What do you expect me to do...?

YOUNG MAN

(very weakly)

...I'm tired, Sir...Sir, there's

no way...

2.

SCOTT

There's always a way...Don't You

tell me there's no way...

SCOTT

How 'bout that? That's called

'Adrenaline'. You said you Wanted

In.

SCOTT

This is where you get in. The

mugger don't care. The shooter

don't care...get up...Or I will

beat you to death on this fucken

hill...Now: you better Catch her...

SCOTT

(responding to his look.

As if to say "That's right.")

There's nothing but the mission...

These are the precincts of pain.

A goddess lives here.

Her name is Victory.

3.

SCOTT

Well done.

YOUNG WOMAN (JACKIE BLACK)

A signal honor to work with you,

sir.

SCOTT

Thank you, Sergeant.

JACKIE BLACK

Sir: Day or Night. Black or White.

You reach out for me. "Black,

Jaqueline A. US 24191489."

SCOTT

I'll remember, Sergeant.

4.

SCOTT

(of the card)

What's this then?

ANTON

It was my father's, sir.

SCOTT

He carry it Over There?

ANTON

Yes, sir.

SCOTT

He come back?

ANTON

Yes, sir. He did.

SCOTT

(nods. Pause)

Well, so.

SCOTT

You carry that card, son. It

might save your life.

(Anton nods)

...You could use it to light a

fire, or something...

BLANE'S AIDE

The Candidate Cadre will fall in

on the White Line...

ANTON

I just wanted to say, sir...That,

to meet you...

5.

SCOTT

(rising, as he gives

the Ranger card back

to Anton)

You never met me. You've been up

for a week. You're seeing Snakes...

ANTON

(looking after the

departing, failed men)

...I can't imagine how they live

with it...

SCOTT

Make sure you can't imagine it,

cause, if you can, it's just one

step to doing it.

SCOTT

(pause)

...they'll be back where they

came from by Morning, and all

this is just a Bad Dream.

ANTON

My name is...

6.

SCOTT

Do I need to know?

(pause)

If I want Camaraderie, I'll join

the Masons.

(pause. Then, summing

it all up:)

There's just the mission.

BLANE'S AIDE

(as he glances down at

his clipboard)

Congratulations on completion of

this evolution. I know you would

probably like some sleep, but I

do not think you'd mind sparing

ten minutes for Induction.

BLANE

Thank you, Bobby.

SCOTT

Not at all, Sir...

BLANE

...You going home?

SCOTT

...weather permitting, Sir...

BLANE'S AIDE

(in the distance. As

camera tracks with

Blane and Scott)

...as I call your names:

(he consults his clipboard)

Grossler, Anton...

7.

BLANE

(over his shoulder, to

an Aide)

...would you bolt the door,

please...?

BLANE

(to the candidates)

...are you tired, Gentlemen?

(the two young men smile)

This is the completion of the

evolution:

(beat)

Only one of you may join the

unit. The first man through that

door will be inducted.

SCOTT

(to himself, quietly)

...yeah...you wanted to know the

'secret knowledge'...

8.

DRILL INSTRUCTOR

(to that man)

What the hell are you looking at?

There ain't nobody there...

YOUNG WORKER

(into phone)

...Frontgate...

10.

SCOTT

(of the photo, nodding

to himself, as he reads)

"...Betty Coed, has hair of red

for Harvard..."

AIDE

(of the top photo)

It's not current.

SCOTT

Why not...?

AIDE

It seems she got a makeover today.

We're working on it.

11.

SCOTT

(reads)

4PM. Cut n'Curl...

AIDE

Gave her a crewcut, dyed it

platinum blonde...

SCOTT

(glancing up at the

man in the chair)

Met with her boyfriend at ten.

Then...?

SCOTT

...he's on Post until he turned

her over to the Nightwatch...?

AIDE

He says he was...

SCOTT

Who else you got...?

AIDE

...we got the boyfriend, Michael

Blake.

SCOTT

...where is he...?

AIDE

Was not in his dorm last night,

we're shaking the trees...And...

(Scott is passed

another photo)

Professor Gerald Sloane, notably

chummy with his female students,

of which she was one. Weekend

home, Martha's Vineyard...

SCOTT

...for sure...?

12.

AIDE

Been there since Friday.

MILLER

I'm light. I'm light, people...I

need another team on the

Professor, I need an overwatch

on the boyfriend...

MILLER

You just come from the Cadre.

SCOTT

Yes sir.

MILLER

How long since you've slept?

SCOTT

Not significant.

MILLER

You take a team, and Bulldog.

Are you up for it?

SCOTT

(absently, as he looks

over the materials he

has been given)

Sir, "this Marine pisses av gas

and farts blackpowder, Sir."

MILLER

Thank you for coming, Bobby.

SCOTT

Are you kidding, sir...?

MILLER

I don't have the bodies. Call em

in...call em in...

13.

AIDE

(whispering)

His post was Harvard Yard.

Harvard Yard, Northeast Corner,

Lowell House, across from her

dorm. Nightwatch relieved him

there, Midnight...

INTERROGATOR

Once more:

GAINES

She, uh. She had lunch with her

father.

INTERROGATOR

Lunch with her father - you

seconded to that detail?

GAINES

No, sir. I just had her.

INTERROGATOR

"...you just had her..."

GAINES

I. Uh...uh. I had her all day.

Tucked her in. At Ten. And she...

14.

INTERROGATOR

...yeah, "she had a tiff with

her boyfriend..."

GAINES

Yes. I...

INTERROGATOR

Michael Blake -

(he holds up a photo

of a preppy fellow)

MILLER

What was it about?

GAINES

I think it was about her...her...

(he makes gestures of haircutting)

MILLER

Her haircut...

(Gaines nods)

So it wasn't a serious...?

GAINES

No, no.

(pause)

No.

(pause)

And then I,

(he covers his mouth

as he speaks)

I held the post until relieved...

(he gestures at his

notebook, as if to

support him)

MILLER

Well, then, we've got a little

problem.

GAINES

(shaking his head in denial)

I was there.

15.

MILLER

(reading)

23.12 Hours, 19 May. Harvard

Yard, Northeast Corner, Lowell

House, reveals no Secret Service

Presence, neither this post nor

adjacent...

(he looks through his notes)

...a second tour, 23.30, reveals,

similarly...

GAINES

I was there, Sir.

MILLER

(to Gaines)

Who's lying?

(pause)

You or him?

(pause. Gaines slightly

averts his head.)

SCOTT

You son of a bitch, I've got

fifteen years in, and three kids,

and you're gonna sit there, and

lie away my Pension...

GAINES

I...

SCOTT

...don't you tell me you were

there...

GAINES

I was On Post...

SCOTT

(as he moves towards

Gaines seriously)

...you lying swine...Don't you

tell me you were On Post!

16.

INTERROGATOR

Shall I tell you what's gonna

happen to you, when we find you out?

GAINES

...I...

(he gets up and walks,

wearily, toward the

windows, and turns)

I...Uh...

INTERROGATOR

Were you fucking her...?

(pause)

We're gonna find out...

GAINES

No, I...um...

INTERROGATOR

...Where Is She?

MILLER

We've got until her Monday

Morning Class, and then it's

Meet the Press; and "Where is

she...?"

(he shakes his head)

Who's got the Professor...? Where

is he...?

AN AGENT

Martha's Vineyard.

MILLER

Who's got him?

AN AGENT

Jones and Shannon.

17.

MILLER

(to the group)

Wake him up, shake him up. He

don't want to talk...

(he holds out his hand,

and an Aide puts some

papers into it)

Here's what we have him doing

with his Female Students, show

'em to his wife...The Photo...?

(one of the agents

brings in two photographs)

Here is the last known photo...of

the girl.

MILLER

The lab ran it up, based on the

testimony of the beauty shop. We

have not told Boston or Cambridge

PD, nor have we...

AN AGENT

The Professor...

MILLER

(to the associate)

You had him in his home...

AN AGENT

Sir, we were in Error, we...

MILLER

Where is he...?

18.

AN AGENT

Best guess puts him on his boat.

Last seen out of West Tisbury,

Martha's Vine...

MILLER

Find him. Put the guard on him.

Get me an overflight.

(generally)

I'm light, I'm light, people.

(he points to an associate)

Shake the Trees. I'm light,

here...I'm 25 men light. Get 'em

in. Who's got the

Coastguard...What's the name of

his boat? Professor Gerald Sloane...

AIDE

It's the boyfriend. He's moving...

SCOTT

I've got him...

MILLER

(coming over to Scott)

...I've got two days to run in.

Before the Press wakes up.

SCOTT

(as he responds to the

inherent request in

Miller's voice)

Whatever it takes, sir...

19.

SCOTT

Could I see your hands, son...?

SCOTT

L. Newton.

(pause)

You lose your mailbox key, Mr.

Newton...?

(pause)

BLAKE

Um.

SCOTT

You a student here?

BLAKE

Yes.

SCOTT

Could I see some identification,

please...? Mr. Newton?

(Scott takes out a

walkie and begins to

talk into it)

Ten-Twelve patrol, requesting...

BLAKE

No, please...please...

(pause)

Please, Oh, God.

SCOTT

Calm down, Son. It's gonna be

what it's gonna be...

20.

BLAKE

One minute, could I please talk

to you for one minute...Look

look look: I broke up with My

Girlfriend...

SCOTT

(of the letter)

Laura.

(he rereads the

nameplate on the mailbox)

Laura Newton?

(pause)

Laura Newton? Is that 'the' Laura

Newton...?

BLAKE

We broke up. Alright? Laura

Newton. They know who I am.

SCOTT

Who?

BLAKE

The Secret Service.

SCOTT

The Secret Service?

BLAKE

That's right, that's right. They

know who I am. You...They've

"cleared" me.

SCOTT

(gesturing to the

jimmied mailbox)

They didn't clear you for this.

BLAKE

You, you hear me out, and, if

you want to, Then...

(pause)

Okay? Okay???

(pause)

21.

SCOTT

I have to call it in.

BLAKE

Please...please. Five

minutes...That's all I want.

Please. Please...She

would...she...

(his face brightens at

the new idea)

Maybe she's in her room!

SCOTT

You tried the bell, you called

her...

BLAKE

(as it dawns on him)

Maybe she's ill...

SCOTT

...Mzz Newton...?

(pause)

Mz Newton...this is Campus

Security...

SCOTT

Mz Newton...?

(pause)

22.

YOUNG GIRL

Hey, Mike. Sprised to see you

there.

(smiles)

That was some Vicious Performance...

BLAKE

...I was just...trying to

retrieve the letter.

SCOTT

...this is not very nice language.

(pause, Blake looks away)

How old is this girl?

BLAKE

She's...just turned 18.

(Scott shakes his head,

sadly. pause)

I was mad.

SCOTT

(of the letter:)

..."everything that's going to

happen to her"...What was going

to happen to her?

(pause)

You hurt her...?

(pause)

Did y'hit her, son...?

BLAKE

Hit her? No. I...

(he gestures to the note)

I called her...I called her a

whore...I...

SCOTT

Why...?

23.

SCOTT

(as if realizing "This

is the question")

Where is she?

BLAKE

(as if the question

had not occurred to

him previously)

She must...she must...she must

have gone home...

SCOTT

Why...?

BLAKE

(gesturing around, quietly)

Because the Secret Service, isn't...

SCOTT

(of the sign on the

letter,the "Picasso"

sign, that is %-}. He

turns the sign

rightside up to show

it is a 'cockeyed smile')

What is this sign?

BLAKE

It's how she signs her letters.

(smiles)

Cause she looks at everything

cockeyed...Like Picasso - she

said they called her "Picasso".

(pause)

SCOTT

Who called her that...?

24.

BLAKE

You know, her, her...

(remembering)

He saw her yesterday! Maybe

she's...maybe she's with him!

SCOTT

Why'd you fight with her, Son...?

BLAKE

(pause)

She, uh, she got her hair

done...She cut it off. She dyed

it blonde. I said she looked

like a slut...and...

(pause)

SCOTT

Beautiful young girl like that.

We've all seen her pictures.

What'd you care how she dyed her

hair?

(pause)

What'd you care...? Why's that

make her a slut...?

(pause)

BLAKE

She...

(pause)

Uh...

SCOTT

She seeing another fella...?

(as he moves closer, confidingly)

...just between us. Off-the-

record, son...

SCOTT (V.O.)

...I was young once, too.

BLAKE (V.O.)

I...

25.

SCOTT

I know that nothing hurts worse

than that. She seeing another

guy...?

BLAKE

I...

(pause)

There's this, um...Teacher...I

shouldn't, I, I shouldn't tell

you this: She...

SCOTT

She sleeping with a teacher...?

BLAKE

She says she isn't. I said she

looked like a slut. She wants to

fuck old guys, she should go to

The Regency. Go all the Way.

SCOTT

The Regency, what's that?

BLAKE

(as if everyone knows

this place)

S'the Club, by the Fenway...it's

like a joke at school, it's like

a rumor: this or that girl, made

a thousand bucks, went with a

businessman for One Night...

Look: it's a Lover's Quarrel. I

said something I regret. I sent

her a note which I regret, and I

assure, you, Officer. If...

(pause)

If you would...

26.

AGENT

No morgue. No hospital. No note.

SCOTT

The parents?

AGENT

The mother,

(makes a "drinking" gesture)

You know where she is...He's

holding up...

(as an afterthought)

He was in town yesterday. To see

her.

SCOTT

(as he shakes his

head - to clear it)

He was?

AGENT

...we snuck him in, and out.

MILLER

(looking at a chart)

"The Colophon - 36-foot sloop".

Where is she...?

AIDE

...the Coast Guard has a watch

over this area:

(he points to the chart)

And they have scheduled the

Colophon first...

27.

GUARD

He copped to it.

SCOTT

He copped to what?

GUARD

(of Gaines)

Off-post - punched out early to

go boffing his girlfriend.

AGENT

Hope she was worth it...

SCOTT

Uh huh.

28.

AGENT

We ran it up from a description

of the colorist from the Beauty

Parlor...

SCOTT

Gimme your coat.

SCOTT

(to Miller)

I need five thousand dollars.

SCOTT

How long do we have? Sir?

MILLER

(shakes his head)

It hits the papers, and we're done.

SCOTT

No...note? No...

SCOTT

(nodding)

I've got it...

(to Miller)

Can I have some backup?

SCOTT

(to Anton)

We're scraping the bottom of the

barrel here, aren't we?

29.

ANTON

Yes. Sir.

YOUNG WOMAN

I need you to sign it.

SCOTT

You sign it.

(He scans the room

again, shrugs, and

motions to Anton)

Come on, Wallflower...

(Anton rises and walks

over to him)

SCOTT

Now: your mouth shut. Your eyes

open, and form on me...Here's

where we're going...

30.

SCOTT

Don't look at him. Don't look at

the Downed Man. He's dead...

(as he turns his back

on the scene)

Kick the fool overboard...

MILLER

...who is the girl he went to

see? Get her in...The girl he

was fucking...Who's got the

Coastguard...

SCOTT

I'd hate to be the Lucky Duck

who frisked him...

(beat)

ANTON

He was off-post when they

snatched the girl?

SCOTT

(as he looks at the

fallen agent)

Yeah. Well, apparently, he felt

bad about it...

31.

BARTENDER

Closing up...

(he points to his watch)

Can't sell you booze after 3 AM.

SCOTT

(laying money on the bar)

No, no. I just came buy to pay

you that money I owe you.

SCOTT

(as he drinks)

...how about them Sox, huh...?

BARTENDER

Yuh. Whaddaya gonna do...?

SCOTT

"Curse of the Bambino".

BARTENDER

...that's right.

(pause)

SCOTT

Nice place you got here.

BARTENDER

You from out of town...?

SCOTT

Yeah, you know, actually, I was

just looking for my Daughter...

BARTENDER

(as he smiles)

...that's what you're looking

for...?

SCOTT

...I. Uhh...

BARTENDER

...ask, because a lot of out-of-

town guys, come in, lookin,

32.

SCOTT

No, I...Oh, no...

BARTENDER

(smiling)

You sure...?

SCOTT

Abso, absolutely...

SCOTT

...girl like that been in

BARTENDER

...pretty girl...

SCOTT

None prettier.

SCOTT

Yeah...I'm looking for a girl

like that...

BARTENDER

...You're sure it was your

daughter...? B'cause, a lot of

guys, come in here, guys your

age, go home with some...some

rather 'younger' girl...

SCOTT

(as he leans forward)

Well, why would a, one of these

'younger girls'. What would they

want to do with me...?

33.

ZIMMER

'Howdy, Pard'.

SCOTT

Hello. I wonder if you could

help me...

ZIMMER

(as he yawns and looks

at his watch, as he

pushes past Scott)

I love you, Baby, but the

season's over...

SCOTT

(gestures at the Bartender)

...my friend says that

you're...you're sort of a

'matchmaker'...

ZIMMER

Izzat what he says...?

BOUNCER

(as he walks away, to

Zimmer, of Zimmer's car)

I put her back in your space...

SCOTT

I was looking for a girl...a

young girl...

34.

ZIMMER

Aren't we all.

SCOTT

My, my, my, my, my, my question

was: why would a young girl want

to go out with an older man like

me? And, if you could "answer"

that...

ZIMMER

Look, Bub...

SCOTT

Don't touch the piece, don't

touch the piece, don't touch the

piece, th'out your gloves on...

ZIMMER

...I think you broke my arm.

SCOTT

(as he shows the photo

to Zimmer)

You seen this girl before...

ZIMMER

(of his arm)

...I think it's broken...

35.

SCOTT

You seen her tonight...?

ZIMMER

...I think it's...

SCOTT

(to Anton)

Pull him up...

SCOTT

Now it's broken.

(of the picture)

What's her name...?

(pause. He strikes

Zimmer in the face)

WHAT'S HER NAME...

(to Anton)

Break his other arm...

ZIMMER

I DON'T KNOW HER NAME...

SCOTT

You don't know her name, then

who is she...?

ZIMMER

Some, some 'girl'...

SCOTT

Some 'girl', some 'pal' of yours?

Where is she Now...?

SCOTT

(to Zimmer)

Oh no...

(pause)

Oh no...this isn't Rohypnol...

(pause)

Is it...?

(pause)

Izziz Rohypnol? Is this "Rho"?

(pause)

IZZIZ A ONE-SIDED CONVERSATION...?

(to Anton)

Whatzisname?

36.

ANTON

(looking at his

driver's license)

Donny Zimmer.

SCOTT

Donny. Donny: where's the girl...?

(pause)

You dose her...?

(pause)

Where is she? Donny...?

SCOTT

...what is this? Ten, what is it,

Fifteen thou...? For what...?

ZIMMER

I never saw that girl...

SCOTT

Oh, alright, then we've got to

let you go...

SCOTT

Where'd you take the girl,

Donny...?

(pause. Silence. To Anton)

You touch his piece?

ANTON

No.

SCOTT

Good.

ZIMMER

THAT'S NOT THE GIRL...THAT'S NOT

THE GIRL!

37.

SCOTT

That's not what girl...?

(pause)

Where'd you take her...?

(Scott points to

Zimmer's pistol. To Anton)

Put your glove on. Pick up his

pistol. Two knees, the other

elbow,

(he points to the head)

Mozambique...

SCOTT

You bet your life.

ZIMMER

Wait...Wait...Wait...

SCOTT

...okay, then...

38.

SCOTT

...beautiful night...

BUSINESSMAN

(nods)

'Less you got hayfever...

(he gestures at the

flowering trees)

SCOTT

...you left something back inside.

BUSINESSMAN

...I left my case inside.

SCOTT

...they got some young girls up

there...?

39.

SCOTT

You see this girl...?

(pause)

ANTON

Did you See This Girl...?

TECH

...she was trying to scrub the

thing...

MADAM

...an escort service. There is

no impropriety, and there is no...

40.

MILLER

(calling back to one

of his techs, who

consults a computer)

...who is she?

TECH

...Nadya Tellich, Serb. Green

Card, in...

MILLER

Have you seen this girl...?

NADYA

We see a lot of girls. They apply.

For the job, as Hostesses...

MILLER

They show you proof of their age...

NADYA

Of course, of course, I...you

41.

SCOTT

(showing her the printout)

Where's Number Fourteen?

(pause)

NADYA

...I don't understand you.

SCOTT

...where's Number Fourteen?

(pause)

NADYA

(pause)

I want my Lawyer...

MILLER

...is this the Girl? Is this her?

Was she in here?

NADYA

I, wait, I no...I...I want to

MILLER

(of the platinum-haired

girl)

Izzat her? It's her, isn't it.

She was here. Is that her...?

BUSINESSMAN (ON TAPE)

...come over here, you little

bitch...That's right, get your

sweet ass over here...

SCOTT

(to an Agent)

Make him watch it.

42.

BUSINESSMAN

I...I...listen...listen: I'm a

wealthy man. I am, I am not-

without-friends in, in the

Administration...

(he takes out a

business card and hands

it to Scott)

...whatever it takes to...

SCOTT

This here, sir. This is a piece

of cardboard.

INTERROGATOR

(as the Businessman

starts to look away)

Don't you look away, you son of

a bitch...

(he forces him to watch

the video)

BUSINESSMAN

I...I...I...

SCOTT

(stepping in)

"I-I-I" - What are you, Carmen

Miranda...?

BUSINESSMAN

I...

(he draws Scott close,

turning from Anton to

the "good" cop)

Listen to me: I cannot. Be caught

here. You write an amount on a

sheet of paper...write it on my

card...

(MORE)

43.

BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)

(he takes out his

business card and hands

it to Scott)

SCOTT

No, Baby. Today we got the Barter

System. And you best pray to God

you got something to trade...

BUSINESSMAN

I...I...

(he takes out his wallet)

SCOTT

IT AIN'T MONEY. YOU SICK FATCAT

FOOL. WHERE IS THE GIRL...?

(he slaps the

Businessman, and Anton

pulls him off)

LEAVE ME ALONE, I'LL GET THE

TRUTH OUT OF HIM...

(he picks up the man's

business card)

Come in here, try to buy me off?

I've got Three Daughters...

ANTON

...maybe we'd...

SCOTT

(as he looks down at

the Businessman's card,

and shakes his head.

He moves back toward

the Businessman,

terrifying him)

...I thought when you wanted to

pet little girls, you picked on

your Daughter...Ain't that what

you rich people do...now you

step off the Reservation and you

want to buy me?

(MORE)

44.

SCOTT (CONT'D)

(he shows a photo of

the platinum-haired

Laura to the Businessman)

Where Is This Girl...

YOUNG WHORE

(looking at the photo

of Laura Newton)

I...She was sick...she was Not

Very Well. She came in

here...and...and...

FEMALE AGENT

...who was she...?

YOUNG WHORE

I dunno...some young girl. I

FEMALE AGENT

Who took her?

YOUNG WHORE

I think that was her.

FEMALE AGENT

Was she here?

YOUNG WHORE

I think that's the girl...they

(she draws the Female

Agent closer, frightened)

...they gave her a shot...

NADYA

I am entitled to my rights, and

I am entitled to a phonecall to

my lll...

45.

SCOTT

(brusquely)

Your lawyer ain't going to help

you...want to guess 'why'?

(he looks to Miller,

who nods, "Go ahead".

he takes the photo of

Laura with the red

hair, sharply, from

Miller and shows it to Nadya)

Y'understand the picture...

NADYA

...ohmigod...

SCOTT

He's with me...

MILLER

(as it dawns on him)

They don't know who they've

got...they just snatched "some

Young Girl". When they find out,

they're going to have to...

SCOTT

She was here. She was here, where

is she...? WHERE IS SHE?

(Scott thrusts the

Laura Newton photo at her)

She was here -

NADYA

...I...I don't know if this is

the...

SCOTT

She was here.

(pause)

46.

NADYA

(very softly, as she

looks around, broken,

for sympathy)

...they'll kill me.

SCOTT

Who did you call. How did they

know, to come get her?

NADYA

I...it's just a number, I...

MILLER

(softly. To phone)

...hello...

47.

BURCH

...where's the girl...?

MILLER

Sir, we believe she was abducted,

from this club...

(as Miller speaks he

passes pertinent sheets

of information to Burch)

That she was taken to...that she

was taken to a bordello...

BURCH

...here in Boston...

MILLER

Yessir, and, that...that...

BURCH

Come on, let's hear it:

MILLER

That she may have been...that

she may have been delivered -

for sale - that she may have

been sent down the pipeline and

overseas.

(pause)

BURCH

(pause)

"...just some girl..."

(pause)

BURCH

How certain are you she was the

girl in the whorehouse?

48.

MILLER

(shakes his head,

meaning "not positive")

...we...

BURCH

Was the girl in the whorehouse?

(pause)

What about your other

leads?...the Boyfriend,

the...Professor...?

MILLER

...sir.

STODDARD

The Professor, where's his boat?

MILLER

The Coast Guard is on the...

STODDARD

WHERE IS THE FUCKEN BOAT? IS SHE

ON THE BOAT...

SCOTT

...we just go where we're sent

and do what we're told when we

get there...

BURCH

You've got the fucken Service

Agent, shot himself...you're

you're telling me, your best bet,

some cocksuckers nabbed her,

took her, took her, they don't

know who she is. And they're

gonna sell her down the river...?

MILLER

Sir...

49.

BURCH

MILLER

BURCH

MILLER

(pause)

STODDARD

(as he holds up the

"Picasso" letter from

the Boyfriend, to read

it. He reads:)

(he holds up the

advertisement of the

Regency Club)

(he holds up the photo

of her hair)

(pause)

SCOTT

(under his breath, not

realizing he's speaking)

BURCH

(reacting, as if to

say, "That's the first

sensible thing I've heard")

(MORE)

50.

BURCH (CONT'D)

Now: Let's talk some commonsense:

(pause)

What can you do for me?

(to Miller)

...who is that...?

(Miller whispers to

Burch. To Scott)

...Get in here...

(Scott comes and stands

by Burch)

BURCH

(quietly)

...what can you do for me? What

can you do for me - I need it

now - I need it before the Press

gets it on Monday. Cause they

will kill her. The jackals start

a feeding frenzy, and she's red.

Help me.

MILLER

Sir: This is the number of a

public phone in Downtown Boston.

(Burch nods)

It's a cutout, between the

Bordello, and the abductors. A

call is placed when they have a

package to deliver.

BURCH

...you going to stake out the

phone...?

MILLER

(nods)

We have a watch on the phone.

More importantly: N.S.A. reports

calls placed to that phone.

Regularly.

BURCH

They can track calls to a payphone?

51.

MILLER

In this case they can.

BURCH

How?

MILLER

They were made from a Federal

Prison.

(he gestures to the

Aide, who shows to

Burch and the camera a

photo of a smiling man

in his forties, in an

expensive suit. Of photo:)

This is Eli Assani. He is a

Lebanese National, serving life

without, for kidnapping. He was

the head man in a white slavery

scheme.

BURCH

And where is he?

MILLER

He's in Lewisberg. We have a

Plan...

(pause)

I hesitate to...

BURCH

Give it to me...

MILLER

They've got some action on the

Payphone...

52.

SCOTT

...who's walking up on us...?

SCOTT

(as he loosens his

jacket, over his pistol)

...who is he?

ANTON

Boston. P.D.

SCOTT

...always a reflective surface...

(then, to himself, as

if reciting a litany)

"...in the city, always a

reflection. In the Woods. Always

a sound..."

ANTON

...and in the Desert?

SCOTT

You don't want to go into the

desert.

53.

ANTON

...they're moving...

SCOTT

(of the hand)

...what is this...?

ANTON

(as he looks down, and

then realizes the

nature of the question)

...it's a wedding ring.

SCOTT

...take it off.

(pause. While Anton

hesitates, not comprehending)

...the ring clicks against your

riflestock, some sonobitch hears

that noise, hundred yards out,

and you're gonna get me killed.

54.

SCOTT

...where's he going...?

AGENT

One Five Four Nine, Alpha Sierra,

Mass Reg. William Barak.

Somerville, Mass...

SCOTT

That's where he's going?

AGENT

Also, owner of Record, In Essex...

SCOTT

Izzey going toward Essex?

(Agent nods)

...what sort of place is it...?

AGENT

It...it'd be a Beach house...

SCOTT

Get me there.

(to the Driver)

Get on the net. Call 'em off.

Everyone off. Just me.

(of Anton)

Just me and him.

DRIVER

...sir...

SCOTT

Nobody out there...

(to Anton)

Just. Him.

(to the Driver)

You indicate that you heard me.

(beat. The Driver nods)

Put it out.

(the Driver begins to

speak softly, relaying

his instructions on

the radio. Scott turns

to Anton. Softly)

How you doing bright eyes...?

(Anton nods. Beat, as

Scott looks him over)

55.

SCOTT

...breathe through your nose.

SCOTT

It stills the heartrate.

(pause)

You got my back.

ANTON

Sir, Yes, Sir.

SCOTT

(to himself)

...alright, then...

ANTON

...you want me to Come Through

the Door...?

SCOTT

(as he checks his

weapons. He shakes his head.)

Don't you go through the door

without an Overwatch.

56.

57.

MAN FROM THE SEDAN

(as he sees Scott)

...what the fuck...?

SCOTT

...I heard the TV, so I came

in...

(pause)

SCOTT

...what the hell you got the TV

on for, there's nobody here...?

(the man puts up his hands)

I don't wanna hurt you. Why would

I hurt you? I just wanna know

why the TV's on.

SCOTT

...I just wannit to know, I just

came to ask you that question...

58.

SCOTT

I'm Coming Up...

SCOTT

(to Anton)

Call em in...

SCOTT

...where's the girl...? You're

dying, pal. Even it up. WHERE IS

THE GIRL... WHERE IS THE GIRL...

59.

SCOTT

You're dying. You're dying, man.

Where is the girl...

SCOTT

...well, you wanted to know...

(pause. Scott kicks

the dead man viciously)

SCOTT

(to himself)

Yeah, everybody wants to know

the Secret Knowledge...

ANTON

...I...

SCOTT

...tell it to the Chaplain.

60.

BRUNETTE TALKING HEAD

...apparently, had her hair

restyled, and cut today, our

Newsteam interviewed her stylist,

and has reconstructed...

SCOTT

Ah, shit...

BURCH

(looking at a TV in

the BG silently,

showing photos of Laura

as a brunette)

...here's the deal:

(pause. He holds up a

photo of Eli Assani,

the Businessman, both

in a suit, and in his

prison garb, with a

number in front of him.

His name, and

"Lewisberg Federal Penitentiary")

...this is the man.

(pause, to Scott)

...you're covered in blood.

SCOTT

Sir, it ain't mine.

(Burch looks at Anton.

Scott, seeing his glance)

On my team, sir.

BURCH

How deep is he?

SCOTT

(saying, in effect,

this sums it up)

...He's on the team.

61.

BURCH

Yeah, well. He may have to be a

little more than On the Team...

(pause. After considering)

I've been speaking to the father.

(pause)

BURCH

(pause)

What about if we had to go "off

the meter"?

SCOTT

...With the Mission, sir.

BURCH

(to himself)

...I'm out of time...

BURCH

...man to man.

SCOTT

The door's closed, Sir.

BURCH

I. Need. To Ask You. To do

something.

(he is hard-pressed to continue)

SCOTT

I am here to get the girl back.

62.

BURCH

This man...Placed a phonecall.

Yesterday. From the phonebank at

Lewisberg. To the Copley Payphone.

(pause)

Here's the cut-off-point...

(he looks meaningfully

at Scott. Pause)

...here it is: This man, Eli

Assani, is to be transported,

tomorrow, Wednesday, with another

convict. A Man on Death Row. For

their medical procedures...Now:

63.

SCOTT

Shut up.

HEAVYSET CONVICT

Yeah, two twelve sierra took all

the 20 he's gonna take...Oh, man,

you left him there...

HEAVYSET CONVICT (V.O.)

...yeah. You marked him Paid in

Full...

ASSANI (V.O.)

...you got to pull over, you got

to stop...I'm bleeding.

HEAVYSET CONVICT

Yeah, he done ate from the tree

of knowledge, our Sierra Two Twelve.

ASSANI

...help me...

64.

SCOTT

Shut up.

SCOTT

...drag him out...

(the man does so. Scott

motions for them to be quiet)

...got some business to do...

ASSANI

...help me...

HEAVYSET CONVICT

...yeah, I heard yah...

65.

HEAVYSET CONVICT

Yeah, Baby. Pass some my way...

SCOTT

Sorry, my man...traveling light...

ASSANI

Don't shoot me, don't shoot me,

I have what you want. I HAVE

WHAT YOU WANT. I CAN GET US OUT

OF THE COUNTRY TONIGHT. TONIGHT.

NO PASSPORT. FLY OUT.

TONIGHT...OH GOD, DON'T SHOOT ME!

I SWEAR ON MY MOTHER. LOOK AT ME:

AM I LYING TO YOU? A SEA PLANE.

TONIGHT. HELP ME. I SWEAR TO YOU.

SCOTT

Why in the world would I believe

a lying convict like you...

ASSANI

Oh, ah, ah, but you do believe

me...I see it...you do. I can

get us out. Help me. I SWEAR TO

YOU. HELP ME...and I will treat

you like a brother...I...

SCOTT

My brother used to beat me

(he raises the cop's

service revolver and

cocks the hammer)

Nice guess, though.

ASSANI

OH GOD NO!

66.

ASSANI

No, no. Listen to

me...listen...make one call. One

call - go in the house. Make One

Call. ONE CALL. An Aviation

Company. Tell...tell them...tell

them the word I say, and they

will say: THE PLANE WILL MEET

YOU AT...

(Scott hesitates for a

moment, and Assani

attempts to capitalize

on it)

Yes. Yes...

SCOTT

You a fag my friend?

ASSANI

No.

(pause)

I am not.

SCOTT

Then why the hell you looking at me?

ASSANI

I was thinking...how fucking

surprised you're going to be.

(pause)

Because, Baby, you just did that

fucken good turn, going to Make

You Rich, Fat, and Happy...

SCOTT

...just get me on that plane.

ASSANI

Didn't they tell you...?

67.

SCOTT

All I heard's a voice on the

phone...

ASSANI

...you like girls...?

SCOTT

Better question, where you've

been so long, do you like girls?

ASSANI

We have. You will have...the

most beautiful...

SCOTT

...most beautiful women, eh?

ASSANI

Not women, Baby. Girls. You got

to trust me, I'm the Doctor

here...All young. All blonde...

SCOTT

And this all takes place Where...?

ASSANI

In Dubai. In Yemen...

SCOTT

Well, that's a long way from

Tiperrary, pal...

ASSANI

...what do you have here...?

SCOTT

Yeah, but I'm not cut out, to

live in a fucken tent.

(Assani laughs)

ASSANI

If you think you can imagine

luxury...I am here to tell you,

my friend...

(he smiles broadly)

68.

SCOTT

Well, may it Just Be So...

ASSANI

When we get to Maskala...

SCOTT

And, now, what's Maskala...?

ASSANI

...when we get to Dubai, better...

SCOTT

What's Maskala...?

ASSANI

...that's where we clean them up.

We ship them Rough, we make them

Smooth, and everybody's happy.

SCOTT

Well, then, you're a

philosopher...huh...? How 'bout

making me happy tonight...

ASSANI

If there's a girl, in the

pipeline, tonight, you shall

have her, what do you say to that?

SCOTT

...I say you're a stone cold

whoremaster...

ASSANI

No, no baby. Take it to the    bank.

The Arabs, Man. All the oil    -

all the money in the world.    What

can't they have? Booze and    Pussy.

How do they get it...?

SCOTT

You the candy man? Is that it?

SCOTT

Ah. Hell...

69.

ASSANI

Yeah, no. I'm bleeding bad here,

friend...

SCOTT

(he looks over)

Yeah, we just, we got to get

some...yeah, you need, all we

need, some tailoring tools.

SCOTT

Yeah, in my wishlist, we had a

drugstore, get us some morphine,

some...

TV WOMAN

...America's Number One Redhead,

"She Sets the Style, She Brings

a Smile", she's Betty co-ed, in

College, and she's off for what

her father's office says is an

"extended sailing weekend".

(the screen shows a sailboat)

With "person or persons

unknown"...yo ho, yo Ho...she

"old" enough for that, our

"Little Red Riding-Hood", Cathy...?

70.

ANTON

(whispers)

...the helo just went down...

SCOTT

...don't whisper to me, Baby, it

draws heat. What helo?

ANTON

...the assault helicopter. You've

got no backup, at the house.

(beat. Scott nods)

You'll be in there, alone, the

first few minutes...

SCOTT

Well, there you go, then.

ANTON

You said "Never go in without an

overwatch".

SCOTT

That's all fine, lad, "But this

is the fleet".

ANTON

You know you deliver him in the

door, you know they're going to

waste you.

SCOTT

...gimme whatever nine mil you've

got...

SCOTT

...just gimme the mags...

(Anton does so)

...gimme your piece.

71.

SCOTT

Thank you...

ANTON

(calling)

Mister...mister: you forgot your

change...

ANTON

(sotto)

...you better take care of

yourself, because...

ANTON

A...I'm alright...I'm alright...

72.

MILLER

Your partner's going to be alright.

SCOTT

I do not look at the downed man,

Sir...

MILLER

Yeah, well...

SCOTT

...Sir...?

MILLER

(sits, acceding to

Scott's request)

...Air Force Assault is airborne,

five minutes out.

(pause, Scott shakes

his head sadly)

Standing down's a bitch.

SCOTT

I stand down when the girl's

back, sir.

MILLER

They'll get her out, if she's in

there...

(pause, as he looks at Scott)

You did your part, what the fuck

do you want, a Citation?

AIDE

...sir...

MILLER

Where are you going.

SCOTT

On the dustoff.

73.

MILLER

Forget it.

SCOTT

Sir...? Sir...?

MILLER

There's no room.

SCOTT

I'm pleading with you, sir...

MILLER

Let him hear the assault on the

Net...

SCOTT

I want to see the girl.

JIM (TALKING HEAD NEWSCASTER)

The death, just reported, the

death of Laura Newton. The... the...

TALKING HEAD WOMAN

...her father, on the eve of the

campaign...

(we switch to a video

shot of this man,

waving off reporters)

Jim, can there be any doubt...

74.

JIM

Tracey, the Secret Service, for

obvious reasons, their records,

the DNA, fingerprints... the...

and, she had just been in the

water a scant, less than four

hours, the...apparently the boat

swamped... she -

TRACEY

She was sailing with...?

JIM

With her professor, Professor...?

(the video shows the Professor)

TRACEY

...a Tragedy, such as this.

JIM

...particularly. Particularly,

Tracey, coming, right at the

start of his Campaign...

TRACEY

Will he delay the start of the

Campaign?

JIM

...his grief...

TRACEY

...he was very close to his

daughter, wasn't he?

75.

JIM

Well, indeed, he saw her, the

day...that would be, the day

before last. He was in Boston

for the Strategy Meeting, and

saw her then...

TRACEY

(sadly)

...and that would be the Last

time...that...

MILLER

Her boyfriend called her a slut.

She went off to prove it. Her

and the Professor. Coked up,

boat capsized...Both bodies

washed up naked. Coast Guard

dressed 'em up...full of Ecstasy...

SCOTT

...he killed her...

MILLER

(shrugs, meaning "who knows")

He was fucking her, they're

stoned...the boat capsized...

MILLER

(almost to himself)

...so much death.

SCOTT

(philosophically, as

if summing the whole

thing up)

...rock crushes scissors...

MILLER

I'm sorry about your man.

76.

SCOTT

He isn't my man, Sir. He's a

trainee.

ANTON

...what time is it?

SCOTT

What do you care...?

(pause. We see that

Anton is having

difficulty formulating

his thoughts)

ANTON

I fucked up.

SCOTT

...in what way was that?

ANTON

(groggily, as he tries

to move, to draw closer

to Scott)

...but I was trying to help.

(Scott reacts to

Anton's pain.)

SCOTT

What? Do you want some more Dope?

Whaddaya want, a Dr. Pepper...?

ANTON

...but I was trying to help.

77.

SCOTT

...yeah, well, that's when people

generally do fuck up. Wait for

that to kick in.

(Anton starts to lay

back, and then, as if

he is remembering

something, he draws

closer to Scott again.)

You're gonna take that fight to

bed for a while. You don't got

to do it all now.

ANTON

(sotto)

I saw the sign.

SCOTT

...uh huh...

ANTON

(drawing him back, as

if saying LISTEN:)

I saw the sign...at the Cape. In

the House.

SCOTT

You saw-the-sign. What sign?

ANTON

...when I dropped the guy. The

girl's Picasso sign...

(he draws the sign in

the condensation on

the plane's window)

She was there. At the Cape. The

girl was there.

SCOTT

The girl wasn't there. She was

on a boat. She fell off the boat.

She's dead.

(pause)

You did what you could. You did

what you were trained to do.

(pause)

You did what you could.

78.

ANTON

...I saw the sign...

SCOTT

(turning away)

...then you are Truly Blessed.

INTERROGATOR

...from the house, a house, a

holding facility, a compound?

called Maskala. The girls are

taken from Maskala, to the

...Royale Hotel, in Dubai.

(he closes the notes,

as if completing his presentation)

As time passes, you may remember

other aspects of...well,

(the Interrogator stands)

You've heard this speech before...

SCOTT

...would be most grateful, sir,

to be included on the mission.

"At Such Time..."

(pause)

BLANE

...on a mission to Dubai.

79.

SCOTT

Is it in contemplation, sir...?

(pause)

SCOTT

Yes, sir.

(pause)

If and When, Sir...

BLANE

You need a rest, Bobby.

(pause. as he extends

his hand)

Thank you, Bobby...

SCOTT

...please don't touch that.

(Scott picks up the

duffle and puts the

strap over his shoulder)

LECTURER

...pick it up.

80.

LECTURER

What are you studying here...?

I'm talking to you, son... What

are you studying?

TRAINEE

Sir, this Candidate is studying

knife fighting.

LECTURER

Hold your ground, son.

LECTURER

(pointing behind him)

...you, and your friend...

LECTURER

There are two ways to fight, you

can fight fair, or you can fight

to win.

SCOTT

Don't you study knife fighting,

son. You Learn to Kill. And then,

f'you meet some other fellow,

studied knife fighting, you send

him to hell.

LECTURER

Next man:

LECTURER

Now: I want to see some evil intent.

81.

GRACE

Hey, fuck it, Huh...?

SCOTT

I've always thought so.

GRACE

How'd the puppy like it out there?

He piss in the punchbowl?

SCOTT

He did okay.

GRACE

I heard he caught poison ivy.

SCOTT

He did okay. Why? You goin' out?

GRACE

What?

SCOTT

You recruiting?

GRACE

Why would I be recruiting?

SCOTT

You speak Arabic, huh...?

GRACE

That's what the Arabs tell me.

82.

SCOTT

You, reason I ask: you going in

the Sandbox...?

GRACE

Ain't you overdue for some Down

Time?

SCOTT

I'm just saying:

GRACE

Yeah. You Marines are a weepy

bunch of motherfuckers.

(Scott nods minutely

in acknowledgement.

And returns to watching

the television)

...you get a chance to bowl in

that tournament...?

SCOTT

(to himself)

...beautiful girl...

TRUCKER

...you say something, Mister...?

SCOTT

No, I was looking at the

television.

(pause)

I was talking to the television.

(he turns to look at

the girl)

That girl's too good-looking for

you anyway. What are you "rich"?

What do you, "own" something?

(MORE)

83.

SCOTT (CONT'D)

(pause)

Or are you "funny" or

something...?

(pause. Hold for a

beat, on the confused

face of the Trucker)

Siddown. Lemme buy you a drink.

SCOTT

You peel the apple?

SCOTT

(as he starts to come

down from the

adrenaline rush)

...well. You should wipe off the

blade.

(MORE)

84.

SCOTT (CONT'D)

(pause. Scott does so,

cleaning the blade on

a napkin)

Or   else...

(as if explaining the

simplest and most

perfect axiom of the universe)

Or   else, it "rusts"...

(a pause. He smiles at

her. Pause)

D'I   scare you...?

(he closes the blade

and sits on the bed,

shaking his head to

clear it)

I'm   sorry if I frightened you.

(pause)

GIRL

...it's an odd knife.

SCOTT

Yeah. I got it from a Russian

fellow.

GIRL

Was it a gift...?

SCOTT

No. As I remember, he seemed

rather reluctant to part with it.

(pause)

It's just a knife.

85.

PROPRIETOR

How you been, John...?

SCOTT

...workin hard...

PROPRIETOR

...bet you have...

SCOTT

How you, Billy...?

PROPRIETOR

...one gallon goin to do it...?

SCOTT

(pointing at him accusingly)

...you been lookin' at my house...?

PROPRIETOR

Nope, just trine a sell you some

paint...

(as he puts the cup

down in front of Scott.

Joking)

...but, now you mention it...

NEW FARMER

...John...

SCOTT

Mr. Reese, how are you...?

(Billy goes to take

care of the new

customer, and turns

back to deal with Scott,

who is waiting to ask

a question)

That new saw blade come in?

BILLY

(as if just remembering)

No, John. It did not. I beg your

pardon. I know that's your

baby...I'm gone call them up and

get Right On That.

86.

BILLY

(as an afterthought)

...'spected you back a few days

ago...

SCOTT

(looking out the window,

absently)

I took the Long Way Home.

SCOTT

Could I see your Right Hand,

please...?

ANTON

There's nothing in my right hand.

SCOTT

Could I see it, please...?

SCOTT

You put your wedding ring back on.

ANTON

(not understanding the

import of the question)

...yes...?

87.

SCOTT

Then I have to guess you're not

"on assignment".

(pause)

You're in the wrong place, baby.

(pause)

How did you find me...?

SCOTT

Well, I guess I'm not as smart

as I thought I was.

(pause)

ANTON

I need to talk to you.

ANTON

I saw the sign.

SCOTT

"You saw the sign". You were up

for a week, you coulda seen Jack

Ruby, you don't know what you

saw...your first-time-out.

ANTON

I saw the sign.

SCOTT

...then, you tell me: you saw

the sign, how is it, they found

the girl, the DNA...why would

they do that...? Her father? Her

father would do that to her?

ANTON

...maybe he doesn't know...

88.

SCOTT

Well. You're living in a

fairyland of your Own Devising.

You're seeing snakes.

(pause)

ANTON

Who's going to Dubai...?

(pause. Scott hesitates)

They've got a white slave ring,

in Dubai, with American girls

there - are they going in?

(pause)

Are they sending you in...?

(pause)

Ask them...

(pause)

SCOTT

You Got. To Leave it for your

Betters.

ANTON

Ask them.

SCOTT

Why would you want to know?

(pause)

Listen up, Pal. THEY don't go

through the door. WE don't ask

why. That's not a COST, it's a

Benefit. Because we Got to Travel

Light. You wanna lose sleep over

it, get over it, or get out.

(hold. pause)

You wanted to go Through the

Looking Glass. How was it? Was

it more fun than Miniature Golf...?

ANTON

I want a favor.

SCOTT

Why would I do you a favor?

OLD LADY

Morning, John, who's your friend...?

SCOTT

Fella wants to buy my car.

89.

ANTON

I saved your life.

SCOTT

Well what were they paying you

for...?

ANTON

Bobby, I saw the Sign...

SCOTT

My name ain't Bobby.

(pause)

ANTON

I saw the sign.

(he draws the Picasso

sign in the dust on

the window of the

country store)

I Saw it. At the beach house.

(pause)

I'm going back.

SCOTT

Back?

ANTON

To the beach house.

SCOTT

They took it apart with a

tweezers.

(Anton shakes his head)

ANTON

She was there. The Girl was There.

I'm going back.

(pause)

I want you to do something.

SCOTT

What would that be?

ANTON

The Secret Service Agent. Offed

himself.

SCOTT

...he was off boffing his girl.

90.

ANTON

He shot himself with a hide-out

pistol.

SCOTT

Yeah?

ANTON

Who frisked the sonofabitch?

(pause)

You ask them.

STODDARD

Number one, the girl's dead.

Number two, the hide-out gun the

Agent shot with's registered in

his 1020 for the past five years.

The man who tossed him has been

sacked. His name is none of your

concern. Now: what the fuck are

you doing here?

SCOTT

Sir, I am not here to question...

STODDARD

Well, then, what the fuck are

you doing here...?

MILLER

Sir, as he said, he is here to

apprise you of a security leak...

SCOTT

...and...

MILLER

To call your attention to what

may be a problem in discipline

with this...

91.

STODDARD

Granted. Granted.

(he stands)

Granted. Fine. Thank you.

SCOTT

And. Sir...If I may...

STODDARD

What is it?

SCOTT

When the operation is staged in

Dubai...

STODDARD

What is this...?

MILLER

He...

STODDARD

...what the fuck are you talking

about?

SCOTT

I am merely saying, when -

STODDARD

Forget it. Walk away.

SCOTT

I...

STODDARD

Yeah...you're a pit bull. I said

forget it. How do we contact Anton?

MILLER

...Anton...

STODDARD

Your partner...He's gone to

ground...

MILLER

Yes, sir...

92.

STODDARD

And, wait, wait, wait, wait,

what does this mean...?

(of Scott)

When and if, any operation is

staged which may require your

talents, I give you my word...

(Scott shakes his head,

saying "I don't believe

a word of it")

You impertinent motherfucker.

What the fuck is with you, you've

got on your "thinkingcap" all of

a sudden...?

SCOTT

I'd like to finish what I started.

STODDARD

And I'm telling you to Stand

Down. Where's the kid?

(pause)

SCOTT

Is there no operation in Dubai...?

PASTOR

...in the Service. In the Service

of his Country. No less than had

he died in Combat. George Gaines,

a man who gave his life to

service, to protecting those who...

93.

DRIVER

...sucker did the Dutch.

SCOTT

I heard it was a training accident.

DRIVER

Nope, he Ate the Gun. Didn't you

know?

SCOTT

I've been out of town.

DRIVER

Punched out early, off with the

girlfriend, his Principal wanders

off, winds up dead: hari-kari...

DRIVER

...rather you didn't smoke in here.

94.

BURCH

I put myself in your hands.

Didn't I...?

SCOTT

I do not follow you, sir.

BURCH

I reached out to you.

(pause)

I put my life into your hands. I

entered into a conspiracy with

you. To commit Murder. Because

it needed to be done.

(pause)

I trusted you with my life.

SCOTT

I would never betray you, sir.

BURCH

(waving his assurances away)

I trusted you with my life. And

yet you cannot trust me.

(pause)

There are things you have not

been told. That's right.

(pause)

And now you're all out-of-line,

"Play me or trade me..."

(pause)

BURCH

(almost as if against

his better nature)

There is an Arab World. To

penetrate it makes trying to

join the Mafia look like a walk

in the park. How would you do it,

Scott?

(pause)

We're dying. We're at war. And

we have no intelligence. How

Would you do it? How would you

infiltrate their clan structure?

Where is the interface?

(pause)

It's at the whorehouse. That's

where they go to get frisky, and

that's where we listen to them.

(MORE)

95.

BURCH (CONT'D)

For the few, priceless hints

that we get from that fucking

sandpile.

(pause)

Had the girl been there, we would

have moved heaven and earth -

you know we would, and, we would

have got her out. She was not

there. She got drugged up and

fell off a boat, and drowned.

She's dead.

(of the funeral)

That man,

(Burch gestures at the

photograph-on-the-

easel, of George Gaines,

the Secret Service man,

which stands by the

head of the grave)

That man a sworn office of the

Secret Service, went to get laid,

and she died. And you are risking

the lives of men and women in

the field, because you won't

take orders. How are you better

than him? Yes. You had best look

sheepish. What the fuck have you

got to say?

SCOTT

No excuse, sir.

BURCH

You're goddam right.

(pause)

Now: where's this new kid who

got you all bothered. Where's

your partner?

SCOTT

...I'll call him off.

BURCH

The fuck you will. You've got

nothing to say to him. He's gone

to the ground. Where is he...?

96.

SCOTT

(beat)

Terrible thing.

(the man nods)

Did you know him?

MAN

Did you know him...?

(Scott nods. Pause. Portentiously:)

Where did you know him from?

97.

SCOTT

(pause)

...you know.

MAN

(pause. Nods)

He wasn't in the accounting

office. You knew that...

SCOTT

Yes. I Did.

MAN

I didn't think, he told anyone

what he did. Because...because...

(he looks for sympathy)

I...

SCOTT

A few of us knew.

(pause)

MAN

And all he cared    about was doing

his duty...that's    all...that's

all... He used to    tell me...

(the man is    now overcome)

SCOTT

I'm so sorry.

MAN

He was supposed to see me that

night...After his

"shift"...We...His wife...

SCOTT

Did she know? His wife. Did she

know?

MAN

How could she? How could

she...she didn't know him...

(pause)

Oh, the poor children...

98.

MAN

...he was going to come to me

that night...after...

SCOTT

...after his shift.

MAN

...his shift - yes...

BURLY MAN

...excuse me...

MAN

...after, after he'd finished

driving him...

SCOTT

...him...?

BURLY MAN

(as he puts a hand on Scott)

I said...

SCOTT

(as he turns to the

man, who is backing

his way out of the bar)

...driving him..? Did you say

"him"?

(he reaches out to the

effeminate man)

BURLY MAN

Yeah. It's a man's world, pal -

but you're in the wrong bar.

99.

SECOND MAN

...what the fuck did you do to

my friend...?

SCOTT

...where are you...? No. Tell me

later. Look: LOOK: Forget the

boat house. Look:

(pause)

Yes, tell me in...tel...look:

tell me when...GET OUT OF THERE.

(MORE)

100.

SCOTT (CONT'D)

GET OUT OF THERE RIGHT NOW. TELL

ME WHEN YOU SEE ME. MEET ME

"WHERE...WHERE THE GUY MADE THE

PHONECALL" - ONE HALF-HOUR...

101.

SCOTT

...ohmigod...

102.

SCOTT

What the hell are you doing?

BELLBOY

(showing the package)

I...I brought you...

SCOTT

Why're you screwing with the

door...?

BELLBOY

I...I...

103.

SCOTT

Why're you screwing with the

door...?

BELLBOY

I took the...I took the sign

off...

(pause)

You had the sign on the door.

F'they saw me...f'they saw me,

knocking on a door, the sign

on...they'd...

(Scott relaxes somewhat.

The Bellboy proffers

the package)

An, I...I figured, you needed...

(he hands the package

to Scott, who takes

out a pint bottle of booze)

You told me you wanted this at

Ten...

SCOTT

...yeah. Thanks.

BELLBOY

(begins to calm down a bit)

...I don't know why you...

SCOTT

You're right, I'm wrong...I'm wrong.

SCOTT

There you go, Pal. Hold on...

BELLBOY

(pause)

Sure. I just...I just wanted to

help.

104.

SCOTT

It's been...quite a while since

my last confession. That...that

"transpired". On the rear face

of a hill, in a mortar attack.

(pause)

And I confessed that I was

frightened.

(pause)

And I have to confess, I'm

frightened now.

(pause. He smiles weakly)

'Nother "irregular Confession".

SCOTT

...I'm about as frightened as

I'm comfortable being.

(pause)

And that's why...I involved you.

(pause)

Which, I suppose, was shameful.

105.

JACKIE BLACK

Now: you did me the honor to

Call me. Now: you tell me how I

might help.

(pause)

There in't nobody here, but two

people in Green.

(pause)

SCOTT

(pointing at the paper)

...this girl's alive...

JACKIE BLACK

Then, you'd better go get her.

106.

WOMAN (V.O.)

...terrible thing, grief...

WOMAN

...you want to comfort them, but

you don't know how.

(pause)

I always think it's better to

Leave Them Alone...

SCOTT

(of Mrs. Newton, and

the woman, talking to her)

A relative?

WOMAN

A psychic.

(pause)

SCOTT

Well.

(pause)

Can we blame her...?

(he gestures, meaning,

we get comfort where

we can find it)

WOMAN

That's right.

107.

WOMAN

...who are you...?

SCOTT

(moving off)

United States Secret Service.

WOMAN

Guess again, 'cause I'm the

Secret Service, and you follow

my directions or I will shoot

you dead. Spread your hands to

your sides, please...

(Scott spreads his

hands to his sides)

Open them...

DONNY

(sotto, unable to stop

her invective)

...the motherfuckers pulled the

Detail off of her...He was in

town. Her father was in town,

they pulled the Secret Service

Detail off her, to take him

tomcatting. He's been doing it

for years. That's what they do.

They turn the Secret Service

into a bunch of pimps. He took

her protection, she got snatched...

SCOTT

He'd let her die?

FEMALE AGENT

...leaving the post...

108.

DONNY

(meaning, "this is my surmise")

The start of a campaign: Your

daughter got kidnapped because

you were out getting laid?

SCOTT

Her father would let her die...?

DONNY

Who knows if he knows. His

'people' would let her die in a

heartbeat.

SCOTT

...her mother...?

DONNY

(pause. She takes up

the earring and she

begins to weep. She

looks beseechingly at Scott)

I'm her mother...

SCOTT

I need some money.

(Donny looks up at him questioningly)

I'm going to get the girl back.

DONNY

What can I do?

SCOTT

I need money. I need a lot of money.

DONNY

(of Mrs. Newton)

I've been signing her checks for

years.

109.

SCOTT

Alright...

(he scribbles a figure

on a napkin)

Can you go this high, that's

what I need...

DONNY

(as   she looks down at

the   figure on the paper)

...I...I   don't...is there

anywhere   else you...

AVI

Didn't they tell you not to come?

SCOTT

Well, I guess I wasn't paying

attention.

(pause)

AVI

Five years ago they told me you

were dead.

SCOTT

You want to gossip, or you want

to do business...?

110.

AVI

Bobby; this is an American girl...?

SCOTT

If that were so?

AVI

If that were so, why don't your

people go and fetch her...?

AVI

...they send a hitter to

negotiate...?

(pause)

My question is: have you forgot

your catechism...?

SCOTT

And what's the answer?

AVI

The answer is Go Home.

SCOTT

Yeah, that's a good one.

AVI

...you're at the Big Table here.

SCOTT

I know where I am.

AVI

Well, then, you better talk to

me using the Decimal System.

SCOTT

Your intel. Two men. Infil, exfil,

hardware, and com.

AVI

And com to what? I cannot give you.

111.

SCOTT

Well, you could, when you where

in the Boy Scouts.

AVI

Yes, but I am not in the Boy

Scouts anymore. You heard the

private sector?

SCOTT

Yeah.

AVI

Well. That's where you found me.

And here's what it costs.

SCOTT

(looks at the paper)

...you're out of your mind.

AVI

No, you're out of your fucking

mind, and you're out of your

league, and my advice to

you:...before some mercantile

soul shops you.

(pause. In disgust, he

picks up the paper,

crosses out what we

wrote, and puts in a

new number)

...for this job, that's what it

costs...

SCOTT

...that's what it costs...?

AVI

That's what it costs you.

(pause)

Go home, Bobby.

112.

SCOTT

Remember me...?

SCOTT

...well, I guess you do have

friends in High Places...I mean

here you are home, n'all...

(he picks up now one,

now another piece of

exquisite statuary,

and smashes it to the ground)

And now we're gonna see if you

also got all that money that you

spoke of.

(he takes out a

videotape box)

This here's a Short Subject, if

you know what I mean. Of you in

Carnal Congress with an Underage

Girl. A PROSTITUE, A MINOR, AND

SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER...

(he holds up another videotape)

There's another...you know how

cheap it is to make a copy...?

BUSINESSMAN

...what do you want?

SCOTT

I want what you promised me...

113.

BUSINESSMAN

(as if reluctant to

impart the information)

...I've, I've already made a

deal with...

SCOTT

Yeah, but you haven't made a

deal with me...So, today is Your

Lucky Day, cause you get to Do,

what Most Men only Dream of: You

get to make Another Human Being

Happy.

SCOTT

(softly)

You had your fun, now pay for it,

Jim. Get your bank on the phone.

We're going to transfer some money.

SCOTT

(to himself)

..."how about that".

BUSINESSMAN

...do you know how much trouble

you're in...?

SCOTT

Yes. And that's the difference

between you and me.

114.

AVI

Maskala is a suburban villa, in

Dubai. The Friends of your Friend,

(he gestures at a photo

of Assani)

Operate there, if you will, a

"halfway house". For the young

women they have induced, coerced

or drugged into spending their

short lives. As the whores of

Arabian tourists. Of late the

girls have been, in the main,

from the former Sov-Bloc. Now

and again, a North American Girl,

if she is exceedingly

lovely,...blonde, usually

blonde...

(he passes the photos

of very beautiful young

girls across the table,

to Scott)

Will, unfortunately, find her

way to Dubai. They travel drugged,

they are -

(he searches for the word)

- "tidied up", and sold. For

some reason, most of them are

sold to Yemen.

(pause)

The girls are generally held, in

Dubai, until the end of the month.

(he checks his watch

and looks significantly

at it)

When the Merrymakers fly in to

examine them. And take their

purchases home.

SCOTT

...and then?

AVI

(shrugs)

That is "and then".

(pause)

This is a floor plan of the

building where the girls are

held, this is the security

arrangements, this is the watch

plan.

(MORE)

115.

AVI (CONT'D)

(he checks his watch

and raises his eyebrows)

The girls are taken from the

house in Maskala, to the Royale

Hotel, I presume you will hit

them in transit...?

SCOTT

(reads)

..."Jameson Construction"...They

know we're there...?

AVI

I hope not.

(he shows documents to Scott)

The conex container for the exfil,

also Jameson Construction.

(he gestures at the

materials on the table)

A passport for the Young Girl...

(he shrugs)

Between fifteen and twenty-five,

they all look alike.

SCOTT

(as he looks at the passport)

Is that your experience...?

AVI

Yes. It is. Nonetheless, we tried

to match it to a Current Photo...

AVI

...she was there twelve hours ago.

SCOTT

Who took the photo?

AVI

(shrugs)

How would I know...?

(pause)

116.

SCOTT

What does the bonus cost?

AVI

(shrugs)

A gesture of Friendship. But. We

thought: if you see some of the

Yemenins -

(he shows Scott candid

photos of several

middle-aged, bearded

middle-eastern looking men)

Any of these, in

particular...would you say Hello

to them?

SCOTT

Who else have you done a favor

for, Avi?

AVI

Bobby: the world runs on manners.

SCOTT

The last third on exfil, in

Geneva. Me and the Girl. As agreed.

AVI

That's not what I was going to say.

SCOTT

What were you going to say...?

(pause)

...the Last Third in Geneva...

(he exits)

117.

118.

SCOTT

...fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

SCOTT

It's good.

(to Jones)

It's very good.

(Jones nods his thanks)

The charge takes the car out...

(to Smith)

We got the flashbangs fore and

aft, You hit the driver, follow

down the driver's side, the car

ain't going nowhere, the muscle

gets out, I cap em, I go with

the girl.

(he points to Jones.

He points to the car.

Jones nods. To Smith)

You exfil on your own, we're on

to the airport.

SCOTT

At the airport. When we hit the

Conex. When you Seal Us In...you

walk away.

JONES

I understand.

119.

SCOTT

I cannot have heat on it. Now: I

know: that you want to protect

the package. But: you have to

walk away. And que sera, sera.

JONES

I won't look back.

SCOTT

(as he picks the seed

up, answering Smith's

unspoken question)

...it's an appleseed.

SMITH

(as he cleans his

firearms, generally,

as if speaking of the universe)

"Johnny Appleseed", eh?

SCOTT

...yeah, I'm just a Man of Peace...

120.

BODYGUARD

...stay in your room, and...

121.

LAURA

...who...?

SCOTT

Stay by me.

LAURA

...they said they were going to

take care of me...

SCOTT

I'm going to take care of you.

You hold on, now.

(as Scott drives he

reloads his weapons)

LAURA

(lazily)

Who are you?

SCOTT

...you remember, Baby, we went

to high school together...

(pause)

You dropped your earring.

122.

SCOTT

You're Picasso, right...? That's

who you are...

LAURA

...they're going to send me to a

Party.

SCOTT

No, Baby, you're going Home.

(pause)

You're just taking the long way

home.

SCOTT

...I told you to stay on the bed.

SCOTT

...you're going travelling.

LAURA

...what...?

SCOTT

...we're going to take a little

trip.

SCOTT

...put that away.

123.

LAURA

...I need a smoke.

SCOTT

Y'can't smoke it. American

tobacco. Smell. Carry. In the

desert air.

SCOTT

Put that on. Over your head.

LAURA

Whatsamatter, you don't like

Blondes...?

SCOTT

Whole world likes Blondes. That's

why you're here. Put the bandana on.

LAURA

(as she tries to light

the cigarette)

I need a smoke.

(He takes it away from

her, and crumbles it.)

...gimme the fucken smoke.

LAURA

I could make you give me the smoke.

SCOTT

Keep it together.

(he takes a small

hypodermic kit)

Keep it together, or I'm gonna

give you a shot and carry you out.

LAURA

Nobody Cares about me...

124.

SCOTT

...that's right...

LAURA

...I'm just a whore...They

wouldn't even come get me...

SCOTT

They sent me...

LAURA

Did my father send you?

SCOTT

(as he lights her cigarette)

...that's right.

LAURA

(derisively)

One man.

SCOTT

One riot, one Ranger, you ever

hear that?

125.

LAURA

Leonides, the King of Sparta,

when a neighboring state would

beg for Military Aid. Would send

One Man.

SCOTT

...well, there you go.

LAURA

...you ever hear that?

SCOTT

No. I think we went to different

schools.

SCOTT

...put the bandana on.

LAURA

(softly)

Did you hear the one about the

king who turned his daughter

into Gold?

SCOTT

Yeah - I heard that one.

LAURA

...I don't want to go home.

SCOTT

I didn't ask you.

126.

LAURA

I don't know where we are...

SCOTT

You just keep it together.

SCOTT

(of the coveralls)

You put this on.

LAURA

(groggily)

...what...?

SCOTT

You...

127.

SCOTT

A little walk-in-the-park.

(he points her to the

News jet)

See there...?

SECOND MAN

(giving his report)

...all of the passenger terminals,

and all access-points to the

Cargo and General Aviation...

LAURA

(groggily, as in a dream)

No, you know what my mistake was...?

SCOTT

(as he looks around)

...what was that...?

SCOTT

...what was your mistake...?

LAURA

(from a distance, as

she begins to laugh,

as at a great private

joke; she stops walking)

...you think we bring our

troubles on ourselves...?

128.

SCOTT

I'm certain of it.

SCOTT

No, no...come on baby...come on,

come on girl: just walk to the

plane: Just Get On the

Plane...WALK TO THE PLANE...

SCOTT

Shussh, baby... shussh...

shussh... it's going to be

alright...

SCOTT

This's going to make Everything

Allright...

LAURA

No!

129.

STODDARD

Leave her Alone.

(to his men)

Don't shoot him, don't shoot,

you'll blow the thing sky high...

SCOTT

Laura...

STODDARD

Thank God we Found you. You know

me. I work for Mister Burch.

I've met you...

LAURA

(drugged and groggy)

He said that he came to get me...

(she shakes her head

in disbelief. Then she

starts to walk a step

toward Scott, then

turns, and proceeds

toward Stoddard.)

STODDARD

That's right, Laura...Walk away

from him. Walk to the Plane...He

can't hurt you now. Walk to the

plane...

SCOTT

(screams)

No...

130.

STODDARD

DON'T SHOOT, DON'T SHOOT, DON'T

SHOOT HIM IN HERE...

STODDARD

Cuff 'im...

STODDARD

(to Scott)

Yes...well...

SCOTT

Let the girl go home.

(pause)

STODDARD

(to his henchmen)

...wait till she lifts off, take

him outside and shoot him.

SCOTT

(as he speaks he moves,

slightly, continuously,

to get a better view

of the girl)

...why can't the Girl Go Home?

STODDARD (CU)

Because she's dead.

(pause)

You had to know the Secret

Knowledge. Didn't you?

131.

SCOTT

What is the Secret Knowledge?

STODDARD

The Secret Knowledge is: There

Is No Secret Knowledge.

(turns over his

shoulder, to look at

Laura, walking toward

the plane)

You went Beyond What Was

Permitted. And the Gods Are Angry.

LAURA

...I'm so tired.

WOMAN

...I'm going to ask you to do

Just the One More Thing...

WOMAN

I'm going to ask you, now, to

walk away from this plane, and

come with me.

LAURA

No...leave me alone. No - I don't

know you...

132.

STODDARD

(to his men, as he,

Stoddard, casts a

glance outside, and

then back)

Alright, take him outside...

(the henchman hoists

Scott to his feet)

FEMALE REPORTER

Oh, my God...

STODDARD

(yells)

Wait...!

JACKIE BLACK

(to Laura)

Keep walking...

133.

HENCHMAN

(to Stoddard)

...do you want me to...?

FEMALE REPORTER

Gimme an uplink Gimme an uplink...

GET IT ON THE SAT. Now Now Now...

FEMALE REPORTER

(to the unseen cameraman)

On her. On her, get it on the

girl...Get us Out of Here...

SCOTT

The girl ain't dead, baby, you're

dead. You see: that's the

difference.

STODDARD

WAIT: WAIT. The girl's home. You

brought her home. Now, listen to

me, because I am going to tell

you...now, you wanted to be

"inside"...I am going to take

you as far inside as you can go:

Z'at what you want...? Is that

what you want?

134.

SCOTT

No, I just wanted to bring the

girl back.

JACKIE BLACK

...is she safe?

SCOTT

That's right, she's safe.

JACKIE BLACK

(weakly, almost whispering)

...well, then...

SCOTT

...that's right, Baby...

AUGUST 2002
