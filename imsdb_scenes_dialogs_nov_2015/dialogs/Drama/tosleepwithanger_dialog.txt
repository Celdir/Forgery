DISSOLVE TO:

SUZIE

Remember, especially you men, that

working together now will already

have formed a bond before the child

arrives. The woman is very

sensitive.

VOICE (O.S.)

Tell me about it.

GIDEON

Spoiling the little foxes that

spoil my vines.

GIDEON

My mind plays tricks on me. Is it

okay if I take a bath now?

SUZIE

Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the

bathroom.

GIDEON

I was looking through my trunk and

I can't find my toby.

RHONDA

What's that?

GIDEON

It is a charm that my great

grandmother made me.

SUZIE

It will show up.

RHONDA

If my daddy calls, tell him I

walked home.

SUZIE

You be careful and thank you for

looking after Sunny.

GIDEON

Babe Brother and his wife are

taking advantage of a situation. I

hate to be mean to people but

picking Sunny up when they feel

like it has to come to an end. Now

I'm going to ask him how come he

couldn't be at your birthday.

SUZIE

Don't bother the poor boy. It just

takes some people a little longer

to figure out who they are.

GIDEON

I don't know how two brothers can

be so different.

KIDS

Shut up! Go help your mama wash

dishes!

DAVIS

We have a complaint from one of

your neighbors about a rooster

crowing in the mornings.

SUZIE

The police are here to talk to you

about the chickens.

GIDEON

What can I do for you, Officer?

DAVIS

You know it is against the city

ordinance to keep chickens or live

stock.

GIDEON

I always had chickens, ducks and

whatnots.

DAVIS

Not anymore, not in the city.

GIDEON

We grow most of our own food. The

money I get from social security,

my pension and my wife's work,

keeps us living on the edge. What

choice do people like us have.

DAVIS

Well, you just have to move further

out.

GIDEON

Now how far would further out be?

DAVIS

I'm not here to argue, sir.

SCOTT

You guys don't make anything

illegal, do you?

GIDEON

Like what may I ask?

SCOTT

You might have a distillery pumping

out barrels of moonshine.

DAVIS

Look, just get rid of the chickens

and you all have a nice day.

GIDEON

I'll be damned if I get rid of my

chickens. I ought to get some hogs

and put them out there.

SUZIE

Who is it?

BABE BROTHER (V.O.)

Babe Brother.

BABE BROTHER

I was hoping you came to the door

instead of him. It gets cold at

night.

SUZIE

This doesn't make any sense; you

are going to drag that poor boy out

in the cold air.

BABE BROTHER

He will be alright.

BABE BROTHER

Thanks for taking care of him. I

will try not to be so long next

time.

GIDEON

What time is it? Do you think you

can just treat us like your slave?

It's after one.

BABE BROTHER

I tried to call to let you know I

was going to be late.

GIDEON

That's a lie.

SUZIE

Let us settle this tomorrow.

GIDEON

Look! Don't try to get ahead by

riding our backs.

BABE BROTHER

(shouts)

I pay my own way.

GIDEON

Since when?

SUZIE

Take Sunny home, please.

GIDEON

Your feet are cold.

SUZIE

Go back to sleep.

GIDEON

I asked you to wake me when Babe

Brother comes.

SUZIE

You all act like two roosters.

GIDEON

I'm not going to let him get away

with murder.

SUZIE

You and Babe Brother are so much

alike...

GIDEON

He ain't nothing like me. How come

a man has to have sons that are day

and night apart? You ought to stop

protecting him.

SUZIE

Hush.

GIDEON

You're always taking his side.

SUZIE

Hush.

GIDEON

I'm trying to make him a man but

you keep babying him.

SUZIE

You're going to find yourself on

the floor.

BABE BROTHER

I want you to be the richest man in

the world so I can be the richest

father in the world.

SUNNY

I don't want to be rich. I want to

work on the railroad like

grandfather.

BABE BROTHER

Son, if you are going to have a

family, you can't always choose a

job just because you like it.

(beat)

I don't want you to shine anybody's

shoes or be a porter. You let

somebody else carry your bags.

LINDA

NO.

BABE BROTHER

He wouldn't want any if you didn't

try to keep it away from him.

LINDA

Because you were spoiled, don't try

to spoil Sunny.

BABE BROTHER

My daddy never gave me anything

without my having to sweat for it.

Every summer, the way they kept me

and Junior out of trouble was to

send us to Big Daddy's farm. We

would get up with the chickens.

Every summer the fence had to be

repaired. The barn needed a coat of

paint. We had to pip all of Big

Mama's hundred laying hens and go

to church all day on Sunday. For

Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were

the mark of a man. Sunny will never

have to bust his knuckles like we

did.

LINDA

I want Sunny to have an advantage

that you and I never had, but he

needs discipline, and you are not

helping when I tell him to do

something and you allow him to get

out of it.

BABE BROTHER

What is a sip of coffee going to

do?

LINDA

Coffee is bad for anybody,

especially for a child.

BABE BROTHER

I don't see you crying about my

drinking it.

LINDA

How old are you?

GIDEON

Instead of standing here doing

nothing, I better give those

chickens some scratch before they

start cackling.

SUZIE

How are you?

OLD JOHN

Tolerably well. I brought you some

more rabbit manure for your roses.

SUZIE

It is so considerate of you.

GIDEON

Well, well, look who is taking up

all the sunshine. Brother John, how

are you doing?

OLD JOHN

I'm still here.

GIDEON

Tell me something. How do you get

energy to stay on the move all day?

OLD JOHN

You couldn't sit on your rump under

my daddy's roof. No sir. If you

couldn't outwork his mule, you

wasn't worth the salt you put in

greens. You had to wake up looking

for something to do. I was raised

as a mule and now I'm a rolling

stone.

OLD JOHN (CONT'D)

I didn't mean for you to pay me for

that.

SUZIE

I know you didn't but you have been

so thoughtful.

OLD JOHN

But when your sunflowers come up,

I'll pay you for them.

SUZIE

I planted a row just for you and

you don't owe me anything.

MOTHER

It hurts.

SUZIE

Don't push too fast! Breathe! The

hard part is over. You can see the

top of the head.

MOTHER

It hurts. The pain.

(scream)

It's tearing me.

SUZIE

Father, give her a hand.

FATHER

Hey, this is too much.

SUZIE

You do your part.

MOTHER

Can you tell what it is?

SUZIE

Almost there.

FATHER

It's a junior.

MOTHER

Ah, I wanted a girl.

JUNIOR

When are you going to find time to

help me fix the roof?

BABE BROTHER

You all don't believe me when I

tell you I'm afraid of heights.

JUNIOR

You used that excuse to get out of

the army.

BABE BROTHER

You always got something to say.

GIDEON

Your mother asked me not to mention

it but your mother's birthday was

last week.

BABE BROTHER

I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some

cloth but it didn't come in and I

felt so bad if I would have come to

her birthday without that, I just

stayed at home.

GIDEON

What did your wife get her?

BABE BROTHER

We got the same thing.

GIDEON

Boy, go tell your wife to come in.

BABE BROTHER

Why don't you come in for a while?

LINDA

I would like to finish reading

this. What would I talk about? I

haven't read this month's almanac.

I don't care to hear about how the

corn was this fall or how to get

rid of gophers by putting garlic in

their holes. They pride themselves

in making life hard and that's not

my cup of tea.

SUZIE

You know, Babe Brother's wife just

dumps greens in the pot without

washing them.

GIDEON

Babe Brother is a poor boy.

JUNIOR

You all should have been hard on

him like you were me and he

wouldn't be the way he is.

SUZIE

Everybody got the same. I breast

fed him like I breast fed you.

PAT

Junior, you are wrong.

BABE BROTHER

Just for a minute.

SKIP

I didn't mean to hit your car. I

was throwing at my birds.

GIDEON

I need about five pounds of laying

mash and you better give me about

the same of scratch.

GIDEON (CONT'D)

When are you going to have a sale

on weed killer?

CASHIER

You missed it. We had a two-day

sale last week.

GIDEON

What kind of a sale is a two-day

sale? I thought sales last a week

or two.

CASHIER

Every day we have something

different. Today's sale is hay. 25%

off. If you have a horse or cow,

you're in business.

GIDEON

All of the preachers were down in

the basement of the church

confessing their sins to one

another. They were way down in the

basement 'cause they figured no one

would hear them. One of the

preachers said, it makes me feel

too shame to tell how bad I have

been. You know them young gals that

sit up in the first row. I can look

at them and forget my text. I'm

just lost when it comes to women,

even them middle age sisters. Then

another preacher said, I don't

think I can tell you what my sin is

'cause it's bad. Another preacher

said, Brother, we all amongst

friends. Tell us what's troubling

your soul. Clear your conscience.

GIDEON (CONT'D)

So the preacher said, we all got a

bond 'cause we confessed to one

another. So let me tell you, my sin

is corn liquor. I just acts a fool

behind that spirit water. I loves

it more than preaching. Now ain't

that a sin, lord. So all the

preachers went on confessing, each

one worst than the last. Finally

they came to the last preacher who

had been very quiet and listening

to every word that fell. One of the

preachers said to him, it's your

turn. Confessing will lift you

burden, Brother. Bare us your soul.

We did. The last preacher said, no,

my sin is the worst among all of

you. One of the preachers said, ah

go on man and stop all this

suspense. So the last preacher

said, like I told you my sin is the

lowest.

(beat)

My sin is gossiping and I can't

wait to get out and tell what I

heard.

SUZIE

You oughtn't tell him stories like

that.

SUNNY

Tell me another story.

GIDEON

I'll you a story about the terrapin

and the rabbit. No, you tell me a

story. Come on.

SUNNY

Once upon a time, my mommy and

daddy lived in this big house that

I bought for them. I got them this

big car.

SUZIE

You stay back. You might cut your

fingers.

GIDEON

I looked everywhere for my toby.

DISSOLVE TO:

SUZIE

Harry, I can't believe it is you.

Gideon, look who is here.

GIDEON

Harry, good God Almighty, man! It's

been, what, thirty years or more.

Suzie, we haven't seen Harry since

we left home.

GIDEON (CONT'D)

This is my grandson, Sunny. He is

my youngest son's child.

HARRY

He kind of favors one of my boys

when he was about his age.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Boy, that is bad luck to touch a

fellow with a broom.

GIDEON

He knows better. Sunny, apologize

to Harry.

SUNNY

I'm sorry.

GIDEON

What are you doing in these parts?

HARRY

I came all the way from Detroit by

bus going to Oakland. The bus

stopped in Los Angeles. I had to

get off and take a rest. I'll catch

the last bus leaving at midnight.

I'm just too tired to go on.

GIDEON

Why didn't you catch a plane?

HARRY

My feet have never been on anything

that wasn't directly attached to

the ground.

GIDEON

Stay until you feel better? I would

like to hear all the news.

HARRY

I'm worn out but won't you feel

like you are taking in a stranger?

SUZIE

Stranger my foot, it was my

grandmother who helped you into

this world.

HARRY

Well, I don't want to put you out.

GIDEON

Man, put your boxes down and stay

as long as you like. We have empty

rooms since the boys got their own

families and moved out.

HARRY

Well if you're sure, I won't be a

bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no

spring mattress. I always make

myself a pallet on the floor.

SUZIE

Poor old Harry, he really must have

been worn out. He has been asleep

all day.

HARRY

Good evening. It must be all the

different time zones I crossed that

makes me feel this weary.

SUZIE

You should go back and rest.

HARRY

No, if I rest any longer, I won't

sleep tonight. May I use your

bathroom to wash up a bit?

GIDEON

Man, act like this is your home.

HARRY

That's awful generous of you. I

always ask to keep from wearing out

welcome.

SUZIE

One can tell you are from back

home. These people nowadays don't

know what manners are.

HARRY

Where we come from, you had to know

how to act right. You had to know

how to say yes sir and no sir. You

had to know your place.

GIDEON

You had to tread softly.

SUZIE

Those days you could always find

something redeeming about even the

worst person.

HARRY

You remember that boy who lost his

mind, Joe? You could hear him

pitching horseshoes at night in the

dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make

him mad and call yourself running

in the house to be safe. He would

pick up a brick and say "go on in

there brick and hit somebody" and

it would find its mark.

SUZIE

I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom

because of him.

HARRY

All those places that us coloreds

lived, that we used to call

Bottoms, have all been changed to

Drives and Heights. Everything is

in what you call it, not in what it

is.

GIDEON

Harry, I would like for you to meet

my oldest son, his wife and

daughter.

JUNIOR

Pleased to meet you. So you're from

back home, too.

PAT

This boy must be turning over. Oh,

he just kicked me again.

GIDEON

It's the boy next door throwing at

his birds. I'm just waiting on him

to hit a pane in the window

HARRY

I'm going to wash up now. You all

please excuse me.

HARRY

Good morning.

GIDEON

You ought to come hear our

preacher. Remember old Cat Iron?

Well, our preacher is just as

strong.

HARRY

Next time when I feel a little

better perhaps.

GIDEON

I was going to get up and get a hen

out there for dinner, but time got

away.

HARRY

Oh, I would feel much at home if

you let me get one for you. I

haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a

month of Sundays. You know, folks

would call my daddy to kill their

hogs. That used to be my trade from

time to time.

GIDEON

Well, I would appreciate that.

LINDA

You don't act like the rest of

Gideon's friends. They believe if

you are not hard at work, you are

hard at sin.

HARRY

Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I

don't believe in sin, though there

is good and evil.

(beat)

And evil is a thing you work at.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Not you mustn't touch. Your mama

might not like you handling knives.

LINDA

I think he wants to see your rabbit

foot.

HARRY

I let this rabbit foot do in place

of my toby that I lost years ago.

LINDA

What's a toby?

HARRY

You don't want to be at crossroads

without one. It's a charm that old

people teach you how to make. I had

one for a long time that belonged

to my grandmother who had it ever

since she was a child.

(beat)

In my travels I misplaced it. I

have been looking over my shoulder

ever since.

LINDA

I thought you weren't old

fashioned.

HARRY

In some things. When we were

children, there used to be an old

man that came around and would

snatch your soul if you didn't have

something on you that didn't make a

X.

HARRY

Did you have your child at home?

LINDA

No. No. No. No. I had my Child at

Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no

county hospital. You have to have

cash or check before you come in

the door.

HARRY

Some folks take that natural stuff

too far.

LINDA

Junior's wife kept her afterbirth'

in the refrigerator. That's why I

do not eat over there now.

HARRY

Country people got so many strange

ways,

BABE BROTHER

Did you ever have to use this

thing?

HARRY

That is called a crab apple switch.

It's for those bad acting monkeys

and just the thing for a mean dog.

Now I don't know if I actually did

what I did or got my life and story

mixed in with other folk's stories

but I seem to recall that I had to

use my crab apple on a boy from

back home. I was up in Memphis

working on the railroad, like your

daddy who had an easy job. He would

sing a song that had a cadence and

we would lay track. Anyway I was

coming down Beale Street and I

heard this music coming from a

saloon. Sure enough it was Emory.

My daddy taught both of us to play

but Emory was natural at it. Got in

a blues band and what not. He and

another boy had killed a boy named

Hocker sometime back and they

balled the Jack leaving town. Emory

had lost one eye and had a scar

running down his face. Bad luck I

would say. He got to drinking that

corn liquor. We went to his girl's

room and he wouldn't stop drinking.

He started talking about the old

days and he went mad. He pulled his

knife and I got to mine first. The

lights went out.

BABE BROTHER

Don't pick up the cards if you are

not in the game. Did he die?

HARRY

I don't know what happened to him.

He just ran out into the streets.

(beat)

I got some old records I want you

to hear. I like the blues sung

simply, man and a guitar. Or sung

by a woman who had bad luck all her

life. Don't ever let anyone tell

you his life's story if it is of a

weary life full of sadness. When I

was a boy, a man told me a story of

how he lost all of his sons and

I'll be damned if the same thing

didn't happen to me.

LINDA

How was church?

HARRY

How often is your wife called to

help delivery?

GIDEON

It was slow. Now it seems like

everyone is having births at home.

GIDEON (CONT'D)

What could have caused this? I just

changed this damn thing.

HARRY

Everything these days is made

overseas.

GIDEON

You and Babe Brother hit it off so

well.

HARRY

Course, it is your business, but I

feel obliged to tell you that maybe

you have not been fair with the

boy.

GIDEON

I tried to teach him right from

wrong just like I did his Junior.

HARRY

Everyone has to follow his own

plough. A man doesn't have to know

how to cut a wick and clean a

chimney nowadays. City people don't

give a hoot and a holler about the

shape of the moon nowadays. You

don't plant old ways...

(beat)

... but, at the end, you find

yourself doing what your father did

but you have to have the land in

you.

(beat)

It's when you want to give the

house or farm to the kids and they

don't want it. You sell it to a

stranger. You worked your whole

life, for what?

(beat)

I doubt if people nowadays have

knowledge of a victory garden or

seen an inch worm. All what we've

experienced has no meaning.

GIDEON

You're suppose to teach your

children what you know. Junior, I

don't have to worry about. Babe

Brother is a different story.

HARRY

You still call him boy. You call

Babe Brother boy in front of his

wife and son.

GIDEON

My daddy called me boy up to the

time he died. I was always boy to

him.

HARRY

'Course, you could be right. Your

sons are alive. All my sons are

dead.

LINDA

It has three bedrooms, one and a

half baths. Well, yes, that means

two toilets and one bath. Well...

Yes, by appointment... Call me back

if you decide.

LINDA

You would think people never lived

in a house if they have to ask what

does 1 1/2 baths mean.

BABE BROTHER

Will you still get the money from

your father?

LINDA

I told him we might not need it, if

you can talk your parents into

giving you your share of the

property.

BABE BROTHER

Pops put Big Daddy's farm in

Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed

it so no one can borrow on it.

LINDA

We could borrow on that land and

put the money to work.

BABE BROTHER

I preached to Mom and Dad about it

but they are stuck in their ways,

it's like talking to a brick. But

if there is a way...

JUNIOR

You want me to mortgage my house to

invest in a scheme of yours? You

know the last time we went into

something together Daddy had to go

in his savings to keep us from

ending on the street.

BABE BROTHER (O.S.)

Why are you always afraid to get

somewhere?

JUNIOR

This is not a good time to take

chances. Your best friend, Robert,

an accountant, lost his home and is

out on the street. We see him from

time to time. He comes down to

church for a free meal.

BABE BROTHER (O.S.)

This is what it is all about,

trying to keep from being out on

the street.

JUNIOR

Robert asks about you. When are you

going to do something to help him?

BABE BROTHER (O.S.)

Maybe I can get down there next

week.

JUNIOR

Babe Brother always acts like a

gambler who is in the biggest game

of his life and don't know about

playing cards.

HARRY

I can sit here and look at train

tracks all day. We laid enough of

them, didn't we? So many memories

are stretched along tracks like

these.

GIDEON

In weather like this, you cannot

walk around bare-headed.

HARRY

We'll go a little farther. The walk

will do us some good.

PAT

Did you do your homework?

RHONDA

Yes.

(beat)

Mama?

PAT

What?

RHONDA

Can I name the baby?

SUZIE

I have someone I want you to meet.

HARRY

I'll be right there.

HATTIE

I couldn't believe it when Suzie

called and said you were staying

here. How have you been?

HARRY

Girl, do you still sing and dance?

HATTIE

No, I'm a different person now,

Harry.

GIDEON

Haven't the years been good to

Hattie?

HARRY

It hasn't been the years; it's been

the men in her life.

HATTIE

Harry, that's not nice. I'm in

church now.

HARRY

Why run out and close the barn door

when the horse is gone? I remember

when you weren't saved. That was

way back yonder when the Natchez

Trace was just a dirt road.

HATTIE

Some people grow up and change

their ways.

HARRY

I know your mother ain't still

operating that house of hers.

HATTIE

My mother passed on years ago.

HATTIE

M.C., you still ain't house broken.

GIDEON

Good God Almighty, if it ain't like

a parade of people from out of the

past. M.C., where did you come

from?

M.C.

I live here.

M.C. (CONT'D)

That's old Herman.

HATTIE

Harry, what did you do, rob the

graveyard?

M.C.

Hattie, do you still dance?

HATTIE

I'm in church.

M.C.

What does that got to do with it?

HATTIE

Suzie, you still have Joe's number?

SUZIE

I will have to look for it.

M.C.

Who's Joe?

HATTIE

None of your business.

HARRY

That is a boy from home, Lulla's

brother.

SUZIE

Harry, you know everything.

HARRY

You got to know everything, do

everything, and be everything.

HERMAN

M.C., I'm worn out. You ready to

go?

M.C.

If you are tired, go sit in the

car.

HERMAN

Suzie, do you have any Swamp Root?

SUZIE

No, but I might have some Indian

Chief Tonic.

HATTIE

I haven't heard anyone mention

Swamp Root since button-up shoes

went out.

HARRY

You can certainly tell how old you

are, my dear.

HATTIE

You know the saying, "your heart is

in your left hand."

HARRY

Now I was trying to be nice, to

make conversation, since we go back

some.

HATTIE

I was quoting from the Bible. If

the shoe fits, wear it.

HARRY

"Out of weariness, I spoke to my

own heart; to leave it all and to

die. And I gave my heart to know

madness and folly."

M.C.

You ain't going to win playing the

dozens with Harry.

HERMAN

You all ought to get along.

HATTIE

Harry, you know you remind me of so

much that went wrong in my life.

When I heard you were here, I made

a special effort to come and see

you. I see you are still a pile of

wet chicken feathers.

HERMAN

Oh Lord.

HARRY

My sister, women can get away with

so much. I don't have any enemies

'cause I don't live in the past. As

Pushkin, you don't know him, said,

"In the hope of glory and good, I

look without fear ahead."

M.C.

Harry has got your number.

HATTIE

An empty wagon makes a lot of noise

and you, tappy head, you ain't

worth the salt you put in greens.

HARRY

Speaking of tappy heads, we ought

to have an old fashion fish fry.

HERMAN

I don't have too many fish fries

left.

HARRY

We can have it here next week.

HATTIE

Is this your house?

HARRY

Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you

say?

GIDEON

Well, it's up to Suzie.

SUZIE

It would be nice.

HATTIE

In the meantime Harry can slaughter

us a hog.

HARRY

I already have, my dear.

HERMAN

Please, M.C., take me home.

WILSON

No one in my family ever been to a

hospital to give birth. My sister

has four children and all were born

at home. My mother and her mother,

it just goes on and on.

HARRY

A woman in family way just reminds

of spring and my younger days.

PAT

That's nice.

HARRY

Well, you and your husband are

special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do

volunteer work to help feed the

poor.

HARRY

How many people do you all feed?

PAT

Last Saturday we handed out over

two hundred meals.

HARRY

Good God Almighty, bless your

bones.

(pause)

But the problem grows.

PAT

Week by week the crowds at the door

keeps getting larger. We can't feed

all the hungry.

HARRY

Of course not. Have you ever heard

of a man jumping in the river to

save five hundred drowning people?

No you ain't.

(pause)

You have to take just one and

fatten him up. When you spread help

too thin, you , you just nickel and

dime the situation. If you try to

save all, all die but if you save

one life, life goes on. You just

have to remember, medicine that

works leaves a bitter taste.

HARRY (CONT'D)

You just take one; you thaw out the

cold and hunger in his bones from

sleeping on the bare ground.

PAT

I don't know if we could take one

in with Rhonda and me at home alone

at times.

HARRY

Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at

you. Hey, you have to think of

yourself. A lot of them have all

kinds of diseases and will cut your

throat while you sleep. There are

too many bad people out there.

JUNIOR

I appreciate you lending me a hand.

That lazy ass brother of mine was

suppose to help me.

HARRY

Well some folks are still waiting

for their comeuppance. Don't take

me wrong but you can't judge people

by how you act. You're a caring

person.

JUNIOR

He should be caring. That is not

too much to ask.

HARRY

Ya, but you can't do the shuffle

with one leg. You and your wife, in

your spare time, work with the less

fortunate. Now I'm not talking

about you and what you do but some

folks that always run to help the

victim, deep down are attracted to

pain and suffering and love to be

near the dying.

JUNIOR

All the people working with us are

really doing it 'cause they hate to

see suffering.

HARRY

You never know what's in the heart

and just because you can cry

doesn't make you human.

JUNIOR

We can't really bring another

family in here with us.

PAT

Why not? Harry says that's the only

way to do good.

JUNIOR

When did you talk to Harry?

PAT

Don't shout!

GIDEON

I think we have enough. So now tell

me a story.

GIDEON

Be careful of the water.

DISSOLVE TO:

SUZIE

Are you feeling well?

LINDA

I've never been so tired in my

life. Where is Sunny?

SUZIE

He is getting his things together.

Babe Brother, you ought to take

your wife home so she can get some

rest.

BABE BROTHER

In a minute.

HARRY

Take your wife and child home, boy.

HARRY (CONT'D)

I got a surprise for you tonight.

HARRY (CONT'D)

This old buffalo has been in the

sun too long.

SUZIE

Fred Jenkins.

JENKINS

Suzie, you haven't changed and you,

Gideon, if you don't look like John

Henry. Oh, this is my wife, Esme.

My first wife Lulie died.

BABE BROTHER

What is that?

HARRY

Boy, that is the real South. That

is real corn liquor.

FLIM

What is in the bottle?

M.C.

It ain't Geritol.

HERMAN

There is a fight in every bottle.

GIDEON

You tappy heads better not tear

down my house.

HATTIE

Look, you better get out of my face

before I slap the living daylights

out of you.

HARRY

You folks excuse me but you know we

have a celebrity from out of the

past, our own nightingale. If you

had any good times in your life,

you remember Hattie. She use to

keep those juke joints steaming. If

Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith were the

stars, she was the sun. Let's get

Hattie to sing something from the

old days.

HATTIE

Harry always tries to be the king

fish. I told him I'm a new person.

I'm saved.

MARSH

Harry, you will not remember me but

we go back quite a ways. I'm glad

Hattie told me that you will be

here 'cause there is a matter that

has been troubling me all these

years that maybe you can help me

clear it up.

HARRY

Man, I can't talk to you now. I'm

filling in the gaps with these

folks.

YOUNGER WOMAN

How do you manage to keep in step

and move around so like one of them

young boys?

OLDER MAN

Get yourself a pace-maker like me.

PAT

These old folks can dance better

than I can. Get rid of that long

face. Get one of these old farts to

show you how to do the Black

Bottom.

OKRA

Don't be so stand-offish.

HARRY

Son, you haven't danced with your

wife all night.

MARSH

There is something that I always

wanted to know. Tell me, how did

those boys die?

HARRY

Now who are we talking about?

MARSH

Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start

with. The Johnson's Hocker was

another one...

HARRY

Wasn't Hocker lynched?

MARSH

You know as well as I do that it

was made to look like he was

lynched. Now who would hang someone

from a persimmon tree?

HARRY

What difference does it make if

it's persimmon, oak tree or

huckleberry bush?

GIDEON

Tell me, how come me and Suzie have

to be mother and father to your

child? You never take the boy to

the park, circus or anything. If we

did not take him to church, he

wouldn't have any sense of

religion.

LINDA

I think forcing him to go to church

when he really doesn't understand

is not saving his soul. When he

gets old enough to make up his own

mind about religion, that will be

better. It will be his intellectual

decision.

GIDEON

Is that the way your parents raised

you?

BABE BROTHER

Why, you don't want us to bring him

over?

GIDEON

No, it's that when do you have time

to be parents to him? You guys

don't pick him up until nine, ten

at night. You are into yourselves,

as the saying goes. Spend some time

trying to be parents. Take him to

the mountains, fishing. You ought

to let him get to know nature.

BABE BROTHER

Well, you are his grandfather. He

is supposed to spend some time with

you. You're supposed to show him

those woodsy things and this and

that.

GIDEON

Junior spends time with his child.

BABE BROTHER

Oh here we go with that.

WILLIAM

Hurry up and take this picture.

FRED

If it wasn't for the NRA, colored

people would have been the lost

tribe.

FLIM

Remember what they use to call the

NRA? Negro Raggedy-ass Army.

MARSH

Hocker's death almost caused a race

riot. A lot of innocent people

could have been hurt behind that.

HARRY

Strange as it may seem, it might

have cleared the waters. Sometimes

the right action comes from the

wrong reason.

SUZIE

Do you want your coat? It's cold

out here.

GIDEON

No, I'm too hot now.

SUZIE

You better be careful. You'll get a

stroke arguing.

GIDEON

I wouldn't care if I drop dead if

he learn something from it.

(beat)

Son, you make me wish I was dead.

SUZIE

Gideon, don't say things like that.

BABE BROTHER

Why does he always pick on me?

LINDA

He is just being like all parents,

concerned about the ones they love.

BABE BROTHER

I don't need that kind of love. And

I don't want to be reminded all the

time that Big Mama's grandmother

was born in slavery. If you really

care about me, just tell me how I

can make money.

SUZIE

Babe Brother, I'm going to take my

hand and hit you across your mouth.

LINDA

He doesn't mean what he says.

GIDEON

Let us go back in before the night

of celebration becomes a night of

me killing my son.

SUZIE

No. Before anyone moves, you two

shake hands and don't carry it any

further.

HATTIE

Don't make me say something nasty

now.

HARRY

I think if anybody had a hand in

killing Hocker, you ought to ask or

you should have asked Emory and

Chick.

MARSH

Chick was outright killed by a mob.

He killed a white man that owed him

some money and when they caught up

with him, they tied him behind a

car and dragged him from out of the

hills back to town.

HARRY

Those boys never did have good

luck.

MARSH

You damn right they didn't,

especially Emory, my cousin.

HARRY

Emory had made a lot of enemies. He

had a big mouth.

HARRY (CONT'D)

What's the problem here?

SUZIE

She has a fish bone caught in her

throat. Could all of you go in the

other room? Gideon, get some bread

and toast it quickly and find me

the cod liver oil.

LINDA

Are you going to work or sleep all

day?

LINDA

Remember, you promised to take

Sunny to Magic Mountain today.

GIDEON

I'm worn out.

SUZIE

Just stay in bed and rest.

GIDEON

I have to feed the chickens before

they wake everybody up.

SUZIE

You stay inside. I will see to

them.

GIDEON

I will appreciate that.

HARRY

How is everybody?

SUZIE

Tolerable well.

JUNIOR

How did you sleep last night?

HARRY

Ah, you young folks don't know how

it is. How is Gideon today?

SUZIE

He wasn't able to get out of bed

today.

HARRY

I hope that it's nothing serious.

SUZIE

He has never gotten rid of the

malaria. He is usually up and at it

the next day. I'm going to make him

fresh chicken broth.

HARRY

Let me earn my keep. I'll go out

and get a hen and have it picked

and ready for the pot. Try to make

him some cow tea next time.

SUZIE

Can you watch Gideon for a while?

One of the girls is going into

labor. Junior is going to drive me

over.

HARRY

You just run along. I'll fix him

his soup. He will be all right.

SUZIE

Oh my Lord!

OKRA

You think old Gideon is going to

live to see this month out?

HARRY

When I came upon the valley of

bones, the serpent said, "Make this

your home. Dry as my soul be,

heaven is lost to thee." We all got

to make way.

HARRY (CONT'D)

A chicken hates to see the preacher

coming to dinner.

OKRA

Herman, you will have to catch the

next one 'cause I'm out of breath.

HERMAN

If I have to chase after one, we

won't eat.

GIDEON

I don't want to stay here.

(beat)

Where is Babe Brother?

HARRY

Never play with someone's else's

cards. You always get a new deck.

Look at this card. See anything?

BABE BROTHER

It is just a regular card.

HARRY

Son, I can take everything you got

with that deck. It is marked. Now

I'm going to show you how to make

some money in case you get stuck

somewhere.

BABE BROTHER

Doesn't he look a whole of lot

better?

SUZIE

Well, you look better than you did

yesterday.

GIDEON

Next time, I don't care how sick

I'll be, don't take me back to the

Veteran's Hospital.

HARRY

Boy, I thought you were about to

cross the river.

GIDEON

I tell you, I feel like a ghost.

HARRY

Son, would you do me a favor and

see if you could turn off that tap

in the bathroom. My hand is too

weak. And would you do me another

favor? I don't like asking this but

would you clean the tub for me? I

have trouble bending over.

BABE BROTHER

Anytime you need someone to do

something for you, just let me

know.

HARRY

That smells like fresh coffee.

SUZIE

Let me get you a cup?

HARRY

Only if you can spare it.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Son, would you get me an old piece

of newspaper?

HARRY (CONT'D)

Lord if you ain't an angel.

HARRY (CONT'D)

I will leave you something in my

will.

BABE BROTHER

What in the hell...

GIDEON

It's good to be able to hear that.

SUZIE

You must have been really sick.

GIDEON

How is the garden doing?

SUZIE

I need to get out there and get

those weeds out.

GIDEON

How is that hen doing? I was

meaning to pip her before I fell

sick.

GIDEON (CONT'D)

I'm going to lie down. Take my,

hand and help me up, lest I fall.

GIDEON

Oh, I couldn't have last another

day in that hospital. You get weary

being in the old soldiers home, old

soldiers and war stories. They wait

to tell you their last story; the

next morning the nurse pulls a

sheet over their face.

PAT

He just leeches off your parents.

He is a master at wearing out

welcome.

JUNIOR

Harry is the kind of guy you would

love to take out in the woods and

leave under a rock.

PAT

Where does her get the power to

summon all his old raffish friends?

They all smell of moth balls.

HARRY

How old is that boy?

BABE BROTHER

Linda, how come you don't see that

Sunny puts his shoes on right?

LINDA

Why in the h...

HARRY

Let's give Dry Bones a call to see

if he is coming or not. Okra likes

to exaggerate, keep you waiting all

night.

LINDA

Why don't you wait?

DISSOLVE TO:

BABE BROTHER

You okay?

LINDA

I'm okay. Go back to your friends.

PREACHER

Sister, we've come to see how you

were doing. We came to ask if we

could pray over Gideon.

SUZIE

I put some Plummer Christian Leaves

under his feet to draw the fever

out.

PREACHER

What else have you been giving him?

SUZIE

I crossed his stomach with cold oil

and gave him some cow tea.

PREACHER

Suzie, I would think you would

depend on prayer rather than these

old fashion remedies. Let us read

from the Bible.

DISSOLVE TO:

PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)

What scene would you like in the

background?

LADY

Something pleasant.

PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)

We have plantations.

PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Natchez, cotton fields, Harlem,

sunflowers, the Mississippi River.

LADY

Put the river behind me.

SUZIE

I don't know where that music is

coming from.

SUNNY

I want my daddy.

JUNIOR

Boy, hush that noise and get in

this house. Make haste.

SUNNY

I want my daddy; I told you.

JUNIOR

Rhonda, drag him in here. If you be

nice, I will take you to

Disneyland.

PAT

Now you don't have to say anything

if you don't want to.

JUNIOR

I want to hear what happened. My

brother is a jackass and a damn

fool. The both of you have been as

scarce as hen's teeth.

PAT

Rhonda, take Sunny in the backyard.

Take a bowl so you can pick some

strawberries. Sunny will enjoy it.

PAT

You shouldn't talk about the boy's

father in front of him. This is

family business and we have to pull

together.

JUNIOR

Whether the boy hears it or not,

the man is still a jackass.

Everyone should have some mother

wit.

LINDA

Something just took control of him.

He stays out all night and comes

home with a pocket full of money.

PAT

It's probably Harry, but I hate to

mention his name, because every

time we say something about him

something bad happens.

HARRY

Let us walk awhile. I grow weary

when I sit still too long.

HARRY

Give me your arm lest you fall.

BABE BROTHER

I could swear I heard my son call

me.

HARRY

You probably heard the wind

stirring up those dead leaves over

there.

BABE BROTHER

I heard his voice as clear as day.

I better get back. Maybe something

is wrong.

LINDA

I told Babe Brother that if Harry

sets foot in our house again, I'm

taking Sunny and leaving. Just as I

said that, here come Harry and his

old resurrected friends, hobbling

up the steps.

JUNIOR

Is that how you got that black eye?

PAT

Don't ask that.

LINDA

No, this was an accident.

JUNIOR

Sure.

LINDA

It was unintentional.

JUNIOR

Babe Brother reminds me of the

story of the man who wanted to be

sizable. He wanted to be tall but

what he was really short on was

brains. There was a time when

people had moon fever were treated

with leeches.

JUNIOR (CONT'D)

It's that nut of yours.

LINDA

What do you want?

(beat)

No. Nothing happened to him.

MR. BAKER

What are you doing?

MRS. BAKER

Counting the gray hairs in your

head.

MR. BAKER

Counting the what? What does that

have to do with the price of

butter?

MRS. BAKER

I was just trying to make

conversation.

MR. BAKER

Where is Skip?

MRS. BAKER

He is in his pigeon cage.

MR. BAKER

I'm sorry he got those birds.

MRS. BAKER

You know the man next door is near

death.

MRS. BAKER (CONT'D)

He must have gotten rid of those

chickens. You don't hear them

crowing anymore... I kind of miss

it now.

MR. BAKER

Don't blow that thing in here. You

blow that thing when I'm at work.

JUNIOR

Why doesn't he just park his car

and come in and apologize?

JUNIOR

Roll down the window and let me

talk to you.

PAT

Stop it Junior!

RHONDA

Mama, come see what Sunny did.

HARRY

How is he doing?

SUZIE

As long as he keeps his throat

clear, he is able to get some rest.

HARRY

I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra

and I thought you need a rest. I'll

stand guard. Okra wants to talk to

you anyway.

OKRA

I brought you these greens and some

salt meat.

SUZIE

That is very thoughtful of you. I

haven't had time to tend to my

garden like I should.

OKRA

You know Gideon and I are lodge

brothers and it has always been a

policy to take care of the wives if

something happens to our brother.

SUZIE

You are very sweet, but Gideon has

already taken care of everything in

case something happens to him. He

has a policy.

OKRA

If you become a widow, you will

need someone around to fix the

whatnots. We like for the widow to

marry someone in the lodge. I know

Gideon ain't gone yet, but there

will be a lot of his old friends

coming around to get in line. I

just want you to consider this as a

kind of a conditional proposal, to

be first in line so to speak.

SUZIE

Excuse me. I have to go feed my

dog.

DISSOLVE TO:

HATTIE

You know Harry lied about how that

boy Hocker got kilt. And it was

Harry who saw Emory last before

they found him hanging over a levee

like someone would hang a hog.

SUZIE

I remember Harry always trying to

help someone. He got Lulla's

daughter out of trouble. He was

always running to the store for

someone who couldn't leave the

house.

HATTIE

Harry always shows his good side

and, like the moon, the other side

is black. Back home he always did

try to act like the colored

gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is

nothing but evil. I'm warning you --

you can't keep a wild animal as a

pet around children.

SUZIE

You know Okra asked me to marry him

the other evening.

HATTIE

Rush your mouth, girl. No, he

didn't. He cannot be that big of a

damn fool.

SUZIE

I asked Harry about it. He didn't

own up to it. He said he didn't

know what got into Okra.

HATTIE

He's just raffish. Harry put him up

to it. Before evening sun sets, I

would have his belongings back on

Route 55, that old fox.

SUZIE

I can't accuse him just dry long

80.

HATTIE

Everybody who have been associated

with Harry end up with pennies over

their eyes.

SUZIE

What must I do?

HATTIE

If it was left up to me, I would

poison him.

HARRY

Good afternoon, ladies.

SUZIE

Good afternoon to you.

HATTIE

I'm going to check on Gideon.

HARRY

As God is my witness, I have never

done anything to that woman.

SUZIE

You must have done something to

her.

HARRY

Since she has repented, all she

does is throw stones.

SUZIE

Hattie is a different person now.

HARRY

I don't make no bones about where

I'm going to spend eternity. I have

always been wild and you know that.

If you are made to feel half a man,

what do you think the other half

is?

SUZIE

I'm glad you brought that up as to

who you are. I have to know who is

in my house.

HARRY

You invited me.

SUZIE

Only if you are a good man, a

friend. Are you a friend?

HARRY

Like that boy next door playing

that his horn. If he was a friend,

he would stop irritating people,

but if he stops practicing, he

wouldn't be perfect in what he does

someday.

SUZIE

I want you to leave.

HARRY

Okra, M.C. and Herman want to go

back home with me.

(beat)

Suzie, I'm not a bad fellow; I just

like to have a good time.

(beat)

M.C. is coming by to pick me up

tonight. I'll come back to get my

things. Well, I hope Gideon

recovers. You know I have an extra

picture of one of my sons that I

would like for you to put with

those baby pictures over your

dresser. It's better than being in

my dusty wallet with addresses and

names of people who are no longer

on this earth.

HARRY (CONT'D)

I'll say my so-longs to Gideon

before I leave and I truly wish

that he will get well.

OKRA

Why did you buy so much toilet

paper?

M.C.

I got that on the job when I was a

janitor. They didn't pay me.

HARRY

Whose old piece of knife is this?

HERMAN

That was my brother's knife.

HARRY

I don't want to wear out welcome,

but you can stay in someone's heart

longer than you can stay in their

house. Come with us, boy. We are

going to have a good time.

BABE BROTHER

This would be a bad time for me to

leave.

HARRY

We are going where the action is.

Ain't that right, Okra?

(then back to Babe

Brother)

Let's play for a couple of bucks

unless you want to start off with

two bits and work our way up.

(beat)

What would you give to be rich?

BABE BROTHER

Had Moms and Pops given me my share

of what was mine, I could have been

rich by now. Linda and I had it all

worked out.

HARRY

I know your mind is on your wife

but you should never treat a woman

as an equal. You want to get your

wife back, get another woman, one

of those big hip women that will

ride you till you sweat.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Double the stakes?

HARRY (CONT'D)

M.C., you ever heard of a real man

having one woman?

M.C.

No, lord!

HARRY

When one woman puts you out, you

have another to take you in. You

don't drive around without a spare

tire, do you? The more mules you

have hitched, the easier it is to

plough.

HARRY

Herman, let me borrow a few bucks.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Bless you. Bless you.

HERMAN

In the ground there is a hole and

green grass growing around the

hole. Now in the hole there is tree

and green grass growing all around

the tree. Now there is a hole in

the ground, a tree in the hole and

green grass growing around the

hole.

HARRY

Let me share something with you.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Hattie is a snake. That woman broke

up so many homes and caused a lot

of misery and because she calls

herself getting religion everything

is put right.

OKRA

These damn things are unloaded,

ain't they?

HARRY

It's important to know the

difference between the incoming

fire and the outgoing fire. As Amos

and Andy might say, "We is the

outgoing fire." Come with us, son.

We'll show you some steaming hot

juke joints, steaming hot women.

M.C.

A pot full of chitlins and a good

time.

BABE BROTHER

Let me go by the house first.

HARRY

We will wait for you as long as we

can. I got to get my things from

your mother's house.

BABE BROTHER

I need to get my suitcase out of

the garage.

SUZIE

What for?

BABE BROTHER

I'm going back home with Harry.

SUZIE

I've heard some foolish things in

my life.

BABE BROTHER

Harry is coming to pick me up.

SUZIE

Have you lost your mind? Have you

thought about your wife and child,

not to mention your sick father?

And I need your help to move his

bed from under the leak in the

ceiling.

BABE BROTHER

I'm busy.

SUZIE

Don't make me raise my hand to you.

You have to see for yourself that

you are going in the wrong

direction.

BABE BROTHER

Can't I be myself without you

jumping in with your right and

wrong? The world is not black and

white. Show me one perfect person.

If you can't, don't ask me to be.

SUZIE

I do have a right to ask you to be

a little bit better than me and

your father because we gave you a

better head start. You have no

right to complain to us about your

not having enough.

(forcefully)

You sit right there with your no

manners self.

JUNIOR

Where is Babe Brother?

SUZIE

Brother is in the kitchen.

JUNIOR

How come you didn't ask Babe

Brother to help you?

SUZIE

He said he was busy. He is mad

'cause he wanted to get in the

garage to get his things so he

could go with Harry.

JUNIOR

So he is busy?

JUNIOR

Why in the hell didn't you help

mama?

BABE BROTHER

I told her I would if she would

give me time.

JUNIOR

I bet you if your master would have

told you to fix the hole in the

roof, you would have rebuilt the

whole damn house.

BABE BROTHER

You always got the best of it

around here and when Dad always

talks about my son, it is always

you, so you fix the roof.

JUNIOR

That is a damn lie and you know it.

Every time father asks you to do

something, you either half-ass do

it or run off and hide. Mama asked

you to turn the dirt in her garden

and you told her, with your smart

ass self, that you weren't a

farmer; get Junior to do it. Every

time someone asks you to do

something, you always say, tell

Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to

grow up.

BABE BROTHER

I told you about calling me boy. I

ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got

a bad habit of calling me boy. You

call me boy in front of my wife.

You think I'm going to fix the

roof? I hope the wind blows the

whole damn thing off and it pours

down rain.

JUNIOR

I ought to break your damn neck.

BABE BROTHER

I'm leaving and don't even call me

when the shoe falls 'cause all he

did for me was to try and run my

life. I'm tired of people saying

Babe Brother this, Babe Brother

that. What's my name?

JUNIOR

You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.

BABE BROTHER

My name is Sam. Samuel.

JUNIOR

Sit down!

PAT

Stop it! Stop it! Look what you are

doing!

JUNIOR

Someone get some lard out of the

ice box.

LINDA

You are going to need some

stitches. We better take her to the

emergency hospital.

BABE BROTHER

I'll drive her to the hospital.

JUNIOR

We will take her. You all stay here

and watch Dad.

LINDA

What about Pat?

PAT

I'm okay now.

NURSE

What sort of emergency are you here

for?

SUZIE

I cut my hand.

NURSE

Let me take a look at it.

NURSE (CONT'D)

Are you all together?

JUNIOR

Yes.

NURSE

The bleeding has stopped but it

will need stitches. You will have

to fill out this form. How will

this be covered, insurance, cash or

check?

JUNIOR

Don't worry about it. It will be

paid. Just let her see a doctor.

SUZIE

I have Medicare.

No, just my mother.

I can't believe what I heard took

place.

SUZIE

How is Gideon doing?

RHONDA

He is asleep now, but he was up all

night eating.

HARRY

I came to pick up my things.

LINDA

You ought to go see how your father

is doing and then wash that blood

off you and change shirts.

SUZIE

Gideon.

PAT

How long is Harry going to hang

around?

WHITE PARAMEDIC

There is nothing we can do for him.

JUNIOR

Well, aren't you going to take him

with you?

ASIAN PARAMEDIC

If he had died in our care, we

would be required to take him.

Since we found him dead, you will

have to wait for the county to pick

him up.

JUNIOR

How long will that take?

WHITE PARAMEDIC

That would depend on how busy it

is. I'm sorry.

DISSOLVE:

MARSH

What happened?

JUNIOR

He slipped on some marbles that

were on the floor. Then his heart

gave out.

LINDA

(to Sunny)

I told you to always put those

marbles up and not to leave them

just anywhere.

PAT

The poor thing is not to blame.

Rhonda, take Sunny for a walk.

MARSH

Here, go around to the store and

buy what you want.

HATTIE

Would anybody object if I take a

look at him?

HERMAN

I don't think Harry would like it.

HATTIE

I never noticed how big his eyes

were.

DISSOLVE:

BABE BROTHER

Mister... Mister... Excuse me for

cutting you off but we pay taxes

too. We should not have to pay you

to take a 24-hour lunch break.

BABE BROTHER (CONT'D)

The coroner said that he was out

here, and knocked on the door and

no one was here.

LINDA

He doesn't know when he will be out

this way again. Somebody downtown

is going to hear about this.

M.C.

They just do that in the colored

neighborhood. If he had been white,

they would had him on his feet and

out of here.

PAT

I got white meat and I got dark

meat. I know it sounds cruel but we

have to eat.

GIDEON

What, are you having another party?

SUZIE

You better come sit down. You are

still sick.

GIDEON

Gal, you're talking to John Henry.

When was I sick?

JUNIOR

You have been out for almost three

weeks.

PREACHER

We had long conversations with the

Lord about you. Didn't we, Sister

Suzie? I said we need him down

here, Lord.

OKRA

That's our friend Harry.

GIDEON

Not our Harry?

OKRA

I wish it wasn't.

GIDEON

What happened to him?

HATTIE

He dropped dead.

HERMAN

Hattie, you can be so mean.

GIDEON

How long has he been dead?

SUZIE

Since this morning.

GIDEON

What happened to your hand?

SUZIE

I cut it on an old rusty knife.

GIDEON

What did you put on it?

SUZIE

It's healing now.

GIDEON

I hope you will take care of your

mother better than that when I'm

gone.

GIDEON (CONT'D)

Babe Brother, is that my shirt that

you're wearing?

BABE BROTHER

Yes.

GIDEON

How come you're not wearing my

shoes?

BABE BROTHER

They're too big.

GIDEON

When is the undertaker coming?

LINDA

They can't say. I'll try calling

them again.

HATTIE

Why don't M.C. and you drag him to

your house?

MARSH

Harry didn't have any relatives

living, did he?

M.C.

Harry was in the world by himself.

MARSH

Somebody has to take responsibility

for him.

PAT

Why don't you look through his

things to see if you can find a

number?

LINDA

How do you like that? They hung up

in my face. I'll fix them. I'll

show them just how mean I can get.

LINDA (CONT'D)

This has been a nightmare.

MARSH

These are letters to his son.

HATTIE

I still don't know if I was right

about Harry.

BABE BROTHER

I have more sense than to give up

everything, my family, you and

Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the

real me inside my body. I'm glad

it's over. It's like a veil has

been lifted.

LINDA

Like a veil has been lifted?

BABE BROTHER

It's like I've been swimming in

muddy waters.

LINDA

Like muddy waters?

BABE BROTHER

It was like all those things old

country people try to tell you what

hell is like.

LINDA

You were in hell?

BABE BROTHER

I couldn't believe the things I was

doing. It was like an internal

struggle going on inside my body.

LINDA

Do you think you won?

BABE BROTHER

It was nip and tuck.

LINDA

And what lesson have we learned

from all of this, Babe Br... Sam...

I mean Samuel?

BABE BROTHER

I guess it proves you really care

about me. You hung in there.

GIDEON

When are you boys going to fix that

roof?

BABE BROTHER

Soon as I rest a bit.

(beat)

I meant as soon as we are back to

normal again, anytime.

GIDEON

Here I am thinking about myself

when poor Harry is resting on the

floor of the kitchen.

SUZIE

It feels like a storm has passed...

Hattie read some of Harry's letters

to a woman he had a child by. The

child had died and he was writing

to give her some comfort. Hattie

didn't know that deep down at the

bottom of Harry's hate, there was

some love.

GIDEON

Did I ever tell you the story about

the man who wanted to make his own

mind up about heaven and hell? He

didn't want nobody's opinion but

his own.

GIDEON (CONT'D)

He's going to check out heaven

first. He gets a round trip ticket

to heaven. He gets in heaven and

finds it just like back home.

People dripping with sweat, working

in the fields, hardly surviving. He

asked a man who was getting a drink

of water, "I thought the streets

were paved with gold." "They are

but you won't see them," he said.

"Boy, you got to work day and night

cause idleness is sinfulness." So

he takes the other half of his

ticket and takes the express to

hell. He sees people stretched out

on their backs kicking back,

picking their teeth. "Man, this is

a dream." He asked, "What's you'll

doing?" They all hollered back,

"Sinning." The devil was shaking

hands with everyone and came up to

him and said, "Please to meet you."

He asked, "I thought you'll was

supposed to be burning in fire."

Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire

down here except under that pot of

chitlins." The man was going go ask

the preacher back on earth...

SUZIE

I don't want to hear any joke about

colored people being in hell.

You're being irreverent.

GIDEON

I'm almost finished. I'm about to

come to the punch line.

SUZIE

I don't want to hear any tales

about colored people...

GIDEON

But these are white people,

anybody. The punch...

SUZIE

I don't care to hear any jokes

about people being in hell. This

cut on my hand reminds me that it

is nothing to laugh at.

GIDEON

It's only a tale.

M.C

Is that an earthquake?

HERMAN

It's something.

BABE BROTHER

I'm cold. I need to get out into

the sunlight.

JUNIOR

What is it, noontime?

PREACHER

I wonder how they going to bury

this man.

HATTIE

Plant him in Potter's Field. He

doesn't need a marked grave.

HERMAN

Hattie, your true colors are

unbearable. You got some mean ways.

Don't worry about the boy getting a

burial. He still has some friends

left on this earth.

HATTIE

His winter has come and gone and I

know right now he is answering for

a lot of things.

PREACHER

It is my job to pray for his soul

and I would like to do that.

MAN

Hey boy, you still got that dead

man in your house.

VIRGINIA

I know you all haven't had a chance

to cook or do anything with that

dead man in your kitchen. You must

be starved to death. Some of your

neighbors have got together and we

set up a picnic table in my

backyard with food and everything

to feed all you all.

SUZIE

Virginia, that is so wonderful of

you all!

MARSH

If the dead wagon comes, we ought

to leave a note telling them we'll

be down the street at a picnic.

PAT

I think we better be ready.

THE END
