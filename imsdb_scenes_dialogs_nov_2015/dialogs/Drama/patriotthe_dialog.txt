THE PATRIOT

by

Robert Rodat

October 9, 1998

SOUTH CAROLINA

April, 1776

THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A

TRUE STORY

MARION

Damnation!

MARION

Sorry.

NATHAN

Father, I saw a post rider at the

house.

MARION

Thank you.  Did you finish the upper

field?

SAMUEL

We got it all cut and we bundled

half of it.

MARION

Those swimming breaks cut into the

day, don't they?

GABRIEL

Father, a post rider came from

Charleston.  You have a letter

inside.

MARION

Thank you.  How's the spotted one's

milk?

THOMAS

Better.  She's near ready to calve.

ELIZABETH PUTNAM MARION   1738-1773

MARION

... and they bundled half... almost

no trace of the boys you knew...

MARION

... no, she still hasn't spoken...

Margaret was her age when you... I

remember the time at the river when

we couldn't find Catherine... you

couldn't stop crying... and she was

asleep in the wagon the entire

time...

MARION

Your children.

MARION

I smell turnips...

WILLIAM

Father, Samuel broke the blue

plate...

SAMUEL

I did not...

MARGARET

Dinner...

GABRIEL

News of Boston, father?

NATHAN

I hate turnips...

SAMUEL

William knocked it right out of my

hands...

GABRIEL

Father...?

MARION

Samuel, William, both of you clean

it up...

MARION

The Assembly has been reconvened,

I've been called to...

MARGARET

Charleston!

NATHAN

We're going to Charleston!

SAMUEL

When, father, when?

MARION

We'll leave tomorrow...

THE CHILDREN

Charleston!  We're going to

Charleston!

MARION

I love turnips...

MARGARET

... now count five finger lengths up

from the front two stars of the Big

Dipper, and that's the North Star,

that's her.

MARGARET

It helps her to know Mother's there.

GABRIEL

The New York and Rhode Island

assemblies have been dissolved...

MARION

The middle colonies?

GABRIEL

Rioting both sides of the bay, in

Chestertown they burned the Customs

House and tar-and-feathered the

Customs Agent.  He died of burns.

In Wilmington they killed a Royal

Magistrate and two Redcoats.

MARION

Anything about the convention in

Philadelphia?

GABRIEL

Poor Richard says they'll make a

Declaration of Independence by July.

GABRIEL

Scott Higgins joined the militia.

GABRIEL

He's seventeen.  A year younger than

I.

THE CHILDREN

Aunt Charlotte!  Aunt Charlotte!

CHARLOTTE

Welcome!  Welcome!  Margaret,

William, look at you...!

(to Marion)

They're huge.  What have you been

feeding them?

MARION

They're from good stock on their

mother's side.

CHARLOTTE

Thank you.

CHARLOTTE

Come, come, inside, wait until you

see what I have...

THE CHILDREN

(simultaneous)

Presents!  For me?  What do you

have?

CHARLOTTE

Inside, inside...

MARION

You look well, Charlotte.

CHARLOTTE

As do you.

MARION

Inside, all of you...

MARION

Very well.

THOMAS

Look!  There's Gabriel!

CHARLOTTE

Children, inside!  All of you!

Right now.

MARION

What news?

GABRIEL

The British army is barricaded in

Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from

Virginia, recruiting for a

Continental Army.

MARION

Is that why the Assembly was

convened?

GABRIEL

Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and

money.

MARION

And the Governor?

GABRIEL

He vowed that if the Assembly votes

a single shilling to Lee, he'll

dissolve the body.

MARION

Which would force our delegates in

Philadelphia to vote for

independence.

CHARLOTTE

And send us to war alongside

Massachusetts.

MARION

Our governor is a bigger fool than I

thought.

GABRIEL

Lee is counting on your vote and

expects you to be the first to

enlist.

SPEAKER

ORDER!  ORDER!

SPEAKER

Our first order of business...

SIMMS

And out last if we vote a levy...

SPEAKER

ORDER!  ORDER!  Mr. Simms, you do

not have the floor.

SPEAKER

Our first order of business is an

address by Colonel Harry Lee of the

Continental Army.

LEE

You all know why I am here.  I am

not an orator and I will not try to

convince you of the worthiness of

our cause.  I am a soldier and we

are at war and with the declaration

of independence we all expect from

Philadelphia, it will soon be a

formal state of war.  In preparation

for that, eight of the thirteen

colonies have levied money in

support of a Continental Army.  I

ask South Carolina to be the ninth.

SIMMS

Colonel Lee, Massachusetts may be at

war, along with New Hampshire and

Rhode Island and Virginia, but South

Carolina is not at war.

LEE

Massachusetts and New Hampshire are

not as far from South Carolina as

you might think and the war they're

fighting is not for independence of

one or two colonies.  It's for the

independence of a nation.

WITHINGTON

And what nation is that?

ROBINSON

An American nation.  Colonel Lee,

with your permission?

LEE

Please.

ROBINSON

Those of us who call ourselves

Patriots are not seeking to give

birth to an American nation, but to

protect one that already exists.  It

was born a hundred-and-seventy years

ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has

grown stronger and more mature with

every generation reared and with

every crop sown and harvested.  We

are a nation and our rights as

citizens of that nation are

threatened by a tyrant three

thousand miles away.

LEE

Thank you.  Were I an orator, those

are the exact words I would have

spoken.

MARION

Mister Robinson, tell me, why should

I trade one tyrant, three thousand

miles away, for three thousand

tyrants, one mile away?

ROBINSON

Sir?

MARION

An elected legislature can trample a

man's rights just as easily as a

King can.

LEE

Captain Marion, I understood you to

be a Patriot.

MARION

It's Mister Marion.

LEE

I understood him to be a Patriot as

well.

MARION

If you mean by a Patriot, am I angry

at the Townsend Acts and the Stamp

Act?  Then I'm a Patriot.  And what

of the Navigation Act?  Should I be

permitted to sell my tobacco to the

French traders on Martinique?  Yes,

and it's an intrusion into my

affairs that I can't... legally.

MARION

And what of the greedy, self-serving

bastards who sit as Magistrates on

the Admiralty Court and have fined

nearly every man in this room.

Should they be boxed about the ears

and thrown onto the first ship back

to England?  I'll do it myself.

(beat)

And do I believe that the American

colonies should stand as a separate,

independent nation, free from the

reins of King and Parliament?  I do,

and if that makes a Patriot, then

I'm a Patriot.

MARION

But if you're asking whether I'm

willing to go to war with England,

the answer is, no.  I've been to war

and I have no desire to do so again.

ROBINSON

This from the same Captain Francis

Marion whose anger was so famous

during the Wilderness Campaign.

MARION

I was intemperate in my youth.  My

departed wife, God bless her soul,

dampened that intemperance with the

mantle of responsibility.

ROBINSON

Temperance can be a convenient

disguise for fear.

LEE

Mister Robinson, I fought with

Captain Marion in the French and

Indian War, including the Wilderness

Campaign.  We served as scouts under

Washington and I have no doubts

about Captain Marion's courage or

competence on a battlefield.

There's not a man in this room, or

anywhere, for that matter, to whom I

would more willingly trust my life.

ROBINSON

I stand corrected.

LEE

Nonetheless, I would like to know,

Mister Marion, how... how... how...

LEE

Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name

do you expect to gain independence

without going to war?

MARION

Harry, Harry, Harry...

LEE

My hairy arse!  You live in a cave

if you think we'll get independence

without war...

SPEAKER

Gentlemen!  Please!  This is not a

tavern!

MARION

Wasn't it a Union Jack we fought

under?

LEE

A long time ago...

MARION

Thirteen years...

LEE

That's a damn long time...

SPEAKER

Gentlemen!  Please!

MARION

You were an Englishman then...

LEE

I was an American, I just didn't

know it yet...

MARION

We don't have to go to war to gain

independence...

LEE

Balderdash!

MARION

There are a thousand avenues, other

than war, at our disposal...

LEE

Name five hundred.

MARION

Royal petition, delegates to court,

judicial redress, economic boycott,

bribery...

LEE

That's five, keep going...

MARION

... time, royal succession,

regicide, bribery...

LEE

You said bribery twice...

MARION

We do not have to go to war to gain

independence.

LEE

Francis, I was at Bunker Hill.  It

was as bad as anything you and I saw

on the frontier.  Worse than the

slaughter at the Ashuelot River.

The British advanced three times and

we killed over seven hundred of them

at point blank range.  And still,

they advanced and they took the

ground.  That is the measure of

their resolve.  If your principles

dictate independence, then war is

the only way.  It has come to that.

MARION

I have seven children.  My wife is

dead.  Who's to care for them if I

go to war?

LEE

Wars are not fought only by

childless men.  A man must weigh his

personal responsibilities against

his principles.

MARION

That's what I'm doing.  I will not

fight and because I won't, I will

not cast a vote that will send

others to fight in my stead.

LEE

And your principles?

MARION

I'm a parent, I don't have the

luxury of principles.

ROBINSON

Mister Speaker, I call for a vote on

a levy to the Continental Army.

HAMILL

Second.

SPEAKER

So moved.

SPEAKER

Mr. Robinson.

ROBINSON

Yea.

SPEAKER

Mr. Hamill.

HAMILL

Yea.

SPEAKER

Mr. Johnson.

JOHNSON

Yea.

SPEAKER

Mr. Simms.

SIMMS

Nay.

SPEAKER

Mr. Marion.

SPEAKER

Mr. Marion.

MARION

Nay.

PAGE BOY

Twenty-eight to twelve, the levy

passed!

GABRIEL

Father, I've lost respect for you.

I thought you were a man of

principle.

MARION

When you have children, I hope

you'll understand.

GABRIEL

When I have children, I hope I don't

hide behind them.

MARION

Do you intend to enlist without my

permission?

GABRIEL

Yes.

LEE

One of yours?

MARION

Gabriel.

LEE

I recognize him now.  Is he as

imprudent as his father was at his

age?

MARION

No, thank the Lord.  He's more like

his mother.

LEE

I'll see to it that he serves under

me.

MARION

Thank you.

"TWO YEARS LATER"

MARION

Not yet, Thomas.

THOMAS

When?

MARION

Seventeen.

THOMAS

But it's already been two years and

that's two more years.  The war

could be over by then.

MARION

God willing.

THOMAS

Alright.  Seventeen.

WILLIAM

Is it going to rain?

THOMAS

That's not thunder.

NATHAN

Father?

MARION

Six-pounders.  Lots of them.

MARGARET

How far away?

MARION

Four, five miles.

SAMUEL

Waxhaus?

MARION

Just east of it.

MARGARET

Are we safe here?

MARION

Don't worry.

MARGARET

We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's

farm.  She's to the west.

MARION

No, there'll be skirmishers on the

roads.  We're safer here.

MARION

Put those away.

THOMAS

But father, they might come this

way.

MARION

Put them away.

MARION

Enough.  I'll be in the workshop.

Samuel, the cows.  Thomas, attend to

your studies here on the porch.

Nathan, on the back porch.  If you

see anyone, come get me.  Margaret,

please keep William close to you.

No one is to go past the yard wall.

MARION

Children.

MARGARET

Samuel...

MARGARET

Samuel, get up to the house.  You

heard father...

MARION

Up to the house, now.  All of you,

come on.  Now.

SAMUEL

They're going to come.

MARGARET

Quiet.

SAMUEL

We're going to have to fight them

off.

WILLIAM

Father will do that.

SAMUEL

They'll probably kill us men and do

Lord knows what to you women.

MARGARET

Samuel!

MARION

Gabriel!

MARGARET

You're hurt.

THOMAS

The battle, were you there?

MARION

Margaret, get bandages and water.

Thomas, the porch, eyes open.

GABRIEL

Have you seen any Redcoats?

MARION

Not yet.  What happened?

GABRIEL

It wasn't like Saratoga.  There, we

stayed in the trees, but this time

Gates marched us straight at the

Redcoats.  They fired two volleys

into us and we broke like straw.  I

was given these dispatches... I saw

Virginia Regulars surrender... as

they laid down their weapons the

British Green Dragoons rode into

them and hacked them to bits...

killed them all, over two hundred

men.

MARION

They had surrendered?

GABRIEL

I have to get these dispatches to

Hillsboro.

MARION

You're in no condition to ride.

GABRIEL

I have no choice, I...

MARION

Margaret, take William and Susan

down to the root cellar.  Thomas, go

to the back porch.  Nathan and

Samuel, the side windows.  Keep out

of sight.

MARION

He's dead...

MARION

Thomas, help me turn him over...

MARION

Thomas!

CONTINENTAL SERGEANT

Thank you.

MARION

Sergeant, there are seventeen

wounded men here.  Seven Redcoats

and ten Patriots, counting my son

inside.  That puts me in a difficult

position.

MARION

You three are the least severely

wounded.  I have to ask you to leave

and find care elsewhere.

SERGEANT

I understand.

SERGEANT

Come on, boys.

THOMAS

Father?

NATHAN

But they're wounded.

MARION

There are rules, even in war.

MARION

After the Battle of Ashuelot River,

against the French, I got this and

the one on my leg.  I couldn't walk.

Washington had to march north.  He

left me with other wounded men and a

like number of French prisoners.

Nine for nine.  When the French

found us, their surgeon gave me the

best of care.  We'll be safe this

way.

MARION

Your best chance is in Bennington,

seven miles east, along the river

road.

MARION

Thank you.

TARLETON

You're surrendering.

CONTINENTAL SERGEANT

Yes, sir.

TARLETON

What unit?

CONTINENTAL SERGEANT

First Virginia Regulars under

Colonel Hamilton.

TARLETON

Who cared for your wounds?

CONTINENTAL SERGEANT

We did.

TARLETON

With a lace table cloth?

TARLETON

Kill them.

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT

These men are of my regiment.  Thank

you.

REDCOAT

Rebel dispatches, sir.

GABRIEL

I carried those.  I was wounded,

these people gave me care, they have

nothing to do with the dispatches.

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT

I understand.

TARLETON

Lieutenant, have a detachment take

our wounded to our surgeons at

Camden crossing.  Use whatever

horses and wagons you can find here.

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT

Yes, sir.

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT

We found this, sir.

TARLETON

Who carried this?

GABRIEL

I did.

TARLETON

(to Lt. re: Gabriel)

Take this one to Camden, he's a spy.

He will be hung.

MARION

Colonel, he's a dispatch rider and

that's a marked dispatch case.

TARLETON

Fire the house and barns.

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT

Yes, sir.

MARION

Colonel...

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT

And the Rebel wounded?

TARLETON

Kill them.

MARION

A dispatch rider with a marked case

cannot be held for spying.

TARLETON

We're not going to hold him, we're

going to hang him.

MARION

But...

GABRIEL

Father...

TARLETON

Oh, he's your son.  You should have

taught him about loyalty.

MARION

Colonel, I beg you, please

reconsider.  By the rules of war, a

dispatch rider with a marked case...

TARLETON

Would you like a lesson in the rules

of war?

TARLETON

Perhaps your children would.

MARION

No lesson is necessary.

THOMAS

Father, do something.

THOMAS

Gabriel!  Run!

TARLETON

Major.

MARGARET

Thomas, please, Thomas...

MARION

Lieutenant, please...

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT

I have my orders.  Sergeant!

MARGARET

Papa, look what they did to

Thomas...

NATHAN

Father, they're going to take

Gabriel...

NATHAN

Father, you can't let them take

him...

MARION

Quiet.

MARION

Don't move.

MARION

Nathan, Samuel...

MARION

Margaret, take William and Susan to

the river shed.  Hide there.  If

we're not back by dawn, go up the

river to the Richardson's house.

They'll take you to your Aunt

Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel,

and I are going to get Gabriel.

MARGARET

But what about Thomas?

MARION

Leave him.  Take care of William and

Susan.

MARION

Nathan, there.  Samuel, there.

MARION

I'll fire first.  Then, Nathan, kill

whoever is standing closest to

Gabriel.  Samuel, kill the last man

in the line.

MARION

After that, Samuel, load for Nathan.

If something happens to me, put down

your weapons and run as fast as you

can, that way, downhill.  Hide in

the brush by the river, then make

your way home, get the others and go

to Aunt Charlotte's farm.

MARION

Boys... steady.

NATHAN & SAMUEL

Yes, father.

REDCOAT SERGEANT

FORM BY TWOS!  BACK-TO-BACK LINES...

REDCOAT CORPORAL

READY...

MARION

Samuel, reload.  Nathan, untie

Gabriel.

MARION

There, there... he's alright... he's

with your mother now...

MARION

Lord, we pray that You accept this

child, Thomas Marion and give him a

place at Your side with his mother.

We ask that You embrace him and help

us to understand the manner in which

Your mercy works.  This we ask, in

Your name.  Amen.

MARION'S CHILDREN

Amen.

GABRIEL

The Morgans, the Halseys, Williams,

Stantons...

GABRIEL

Father, it's safe.

MARION

Sleep, now.

NATHAN

Father... I killed those men...

MARION

Don't blame yourself, you did what I

told you to do.

NATHAN

I'm glad I killed them... I'm

glad...

MARION

Try to get some sleep.

CHARLOTTE

I'll stay with them.

GABRIEL

How are they?

GABRIEL

Gates is at Hillsboro with the

Continental Army.  I'll leave in the

morning to join him.

GABRIEL

I'll tend my horse.

CHARLOTTE

They're asleep.

MARION

How did this... how did I let this

happen?

CHARLOTTE

You couldn't have known.

MARION

I should have known... once I would

have... I used to be wary... and

today I watched my son killed before

my eyes... your sister civilized me

and I damn myself for having let

her...

CHARLOTTE

Thomas is dead but you've done

nothing for which you should be

ashamed.

MARION

I've done nothing and for that I am

ashamed.

CHARLOTTE

If you go, I'll care for them as if

they were my own.

MARION

I'll leave in the morning with

Gabriel.

WILLIAM

When will you be back?

MARION

I don't know, William.

WILLIAM

Tomorrow?

MARGARET

No, not tomorrow.

MARION

Goodbye?

MARION

Just one word?  Goodbye?  That's all

I want.

SUSAN

Goodbye.

MARION

No, it's too late.

MARION

Command posts... Patriot...

British...

MARION

Break for the trees... break for the

trees...

MARION

Send them to cover!  Goddamn you!

GABRIEL

Father, we have to do something...

GABRIEL

Father...

MARION

It's already over.

LEE

Damn you, Sergeant, don't move the

wounded twice, put them straight on

the wagons from the surgeons.

PATRIOT SERGEANT

Yes, sir.

LEE

Lieutenant, detail men for

outriders.  We move out as soon as

the wounded are ready.

LIEUTENANT

Yes, sir.

MARION

Green Dragoons came to my home,

killed my son, Thomas.  It was

Tarleton himself.

LEE

I'm sorry.

MARION

I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.

LEE

There's nothing you could have done,

Gates is a damned fool.

MARION

We saw.

LEE

I begged him to stay in the cover of

the trees but he insisted the only

way to break Cornwallis was muzzle-

to-muzzle.  He spent too many years

in the British army.

MARION

Where is he now?

LEE

Last anyone saw, riding hard,

northeast, his staff a hundred yards

behind, trying to catch up.

MARION

Who's in command?

LEE

I am, I think.

MARION

What are my orders?

LEE

If you want orders, I've got some

for you.

LEE

We're a breath away from losing this

war.  In the North, Washington is

reeling from Valley Forge, running

and hiding from Clinton and twelve

thousand Redcoats.

(pointing)

Here in the South, Cornwallis has

broken our back.  He captured over

five thousand of our troops when he

took Charleston and today he

destroyed the only army that stood

between him and New York.

MARION

So now Cornwallis will head north,

link up with Clinton and finish off

Washington.

LEE

And Patriots will start dying on the

gallows instead of the battlefield.

(beat)

Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the

South until the French arrive.  A

treaty was signed at Versailles

after our victory at Saratoga.  The

French are sending a fleet and ten

thousand troops.

MARION

When?

LEE

Fall, six months at the earliest.

MARION

Long time.

LEE

The bigger problem is where, not

when.  The French fleet won't sail

north of the Chesapeake for fear of

early storms.

MARION

So you're going to try to keep

Cornwallis in the South until then.

LEE

Not me, you.  I'm going north with

every Continental regular I can find

to reinforce Washington or he won't

last six weeks.

MARION

You expect Cornwallis to be held

here by militia?

LEE

Not held, just slowed down.

MARION

They're nothing but farmers and

you're asking them to try to keep a

tiger in their backyard.  They'd be

better off letting it move on.

LEE

They'd be better off, but the cause

wouldn't be.

MARION

How many men does Cornwallis have

under his command?

LEE

Four thousand infantry and around

six hundred cavalry...

(beat)

... including the Green Dragoons

under Tarleton.

MARION

I'll do what I can.

LEE

I'm giving you a field commission as

a colonel.

GABRIEL

Colonel Lee, I request a transfer to

Colonel Marion's command.

LEE

Granted.

LEE

Good luck.

GABRIEL

What now, sir?

MARION

We put out the word.  We'll start

along the south side of the

Santee...

GABRIEL

We'd cover more ground if we split

up.

MARION

It's safer if we stay together.

GABRIEL

Colonel, I didn't request this

transfer because you're my father.

I requested it because I believe in

this cause and this is where I can

do the most good.

MARION

Oh?

GABRIEL

I've been doing this for two years.

I'm the best scout in the

Continental Army, the best horseman,

the best shot, the best scavenger

and I know every deer path and swamp

trail between here and Charleston.

MARION

Is that so?

GABRIEL

Yes, sir.

(beat)

My father taught me.

MARION

Did your father teach you humility?

GABRIEL

He tried.  It didn't take.

MARION

Alright, Corporal, you take

Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and

the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll

take the north side of the river.

We'll meet at Snow's Island.

GABRIEL

Yes, sir.

MARION

And, Corporal...

(beat)

... be careful.

GABRIEL

Yes...

(beat)

... father.

MARION

I'm looking for John Billings.

BARTENDER

He's dead.

MARION

If he comes back from the dead, tell

him Francis Marion is looking for

him.

BARTENDER

I'll be sure to do that.

MARION

I'll wait.  Miracles happen.

BILLINGS

You expect to hold Cornwallis with

militia?

MARION

I expect to try.

BILLINGS

Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember

that damned overland you two thought

up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?

MARION

It worked.  How many men can you

raise?

BILLINGS

Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've

got their reasons; Rev. Oliver,

he believes in the cause; some of

the young bucks; a few like me with

nothing to lose...

(beat)

What about you?  You've got a lot to

lose.

MARION

You coming, or not?

GABRIEL

Father, this war is about more than

Thomas.

MARION

Is it?

GABRIEL

If you're here only for revenge,

you're doing a disservice to him as

well as yourself.

MARION

How old are you?

GABRIEL

You know how old I am.

MARION

God help us all when you're forty.

MARION

Reverend.

REV. OLIVER

I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.

MARION

Dalton.

MARION

You all have your own reasons for

being here.  I lost a son and I

intend to kill the man who killed

him...

MARION

... But I don't consider that man's

life adequate payment for the life

of my son, and killing him won't

keep the sons of other men from

dying...

MARION

Cornwallis has to move north.  We

have to keep him right here.  If

he's south of the Chesapeake when

the French arrive, if the French

arrive, we have a chance of winning

this war.

MARION

Eat, get some rest, we move out in

two hours.

CORNWALLIS

Gentlemen.

CORNWALLIS

Major, this is not an adequate map.

MAJOR HUNTINGTON

We have better coming on the

trailing supply convoy from

Charleston.

CORNWALLIS

A useful place for our maps.

MAJOR HUNTINGTON

I'm sorry, sir, it won't happen

again.

CORNWALLIS

My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.

TARLETON

Sir.

CORNWALLIS

Gentlemen, celebration is premature.

We have a difficult campaign ahead

of us.  We are in predominately

hostile country and we cannot rely

on forage.  As we move north, the

bulk of our supplies will reach us

by sea, through Charleston, which

will give us a long and vulnerable

supply line, one that can only be

secured if the locals are loyal to

the crown.

CORNWALLIS' OFFICERS

(multiple)

Yes, sir.

CORNWALLIS

Nonetheless, we must remember that

this is a civil war...

CORNWALLIS

These colonials are our brethren and

when this conflict is over, we will

be reestablishing commerce with

them.  Surrendering troops will be

given quarter and unwarranted

assaults on civilians will cease.

CORNWALLIS

I expect this war to be fought in a

vigorous but civilized manner.

CORNWALLIS

Have I made myself clear, gentlemen?

OFFICERS

(multiple)

Yes, sir.

TARLETON

Yes, sir.

WILKINS

I believe he was speaking to us,

Colonel.

TARLETON

Did you know that Lord Cornwallis'

father was a tenant on the estate of

my grandfather?

GABRIEL

Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons,

a company of Redcoat infantry,

horses at the rear.

MARION

Flanking riders?

GABRIEL

I didn't see any.

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT

Across the river!  Covering fire!

Double rank!

MARION

Epaulets first... Kill the officers.

MARION

THE WAGONS!

REV. OLIVER

... two-hundred-sixty-six Brown Bess

muskets, forty-one casks of powder,

balls, tamping...

BILLINGS

We have enough arms for an army.

Now all we need is an army.

SCOTT

Reamer, boring tool...

MARION

Swage, broach, etching tool...

FIELDING

A rolling gunsmith's shop...

SCOTT

We can rifle those musket barrels...

FIELDING

Get another hundred yards out of

'em...

MARION

We'll need a forge...

SCOTT

Easy enough...

MARION

We've got clay to make a chamber...

FIELDING

Oak to make charcoal...

SCOTT

Oil cloth and barrel staves to make

a bellows...

MARION

And we can yank a wagon wheel,

weight it, rig a piston and drive

shaft and we'll have a flywheel to

power the bellows...

SCOTT

(to Fielding)

That's why he's a colonel.

BILLINGS

Shoot them!  Shoot the damn things!

MARION

Put that pistol down!

SCOTT

They followed us from the bridge.

They won't let anyone near the

wagon.

MARION

Stay... stay... stay...

MARION

Don't you growl at me!

MARION

Now let's see what's in this wagon.

ABNER

Rum, French Champagne, Madeira,

Port...

BILLINGS

No wonder they were guarding it.

REV. OLIVER

My heavens, personal correspondence

of... Lord Cornwallis.

MARION

These four wagons must be his.

GABRIEL

And the dogs, too, I'll wager.

BILLINGS

I say we drink the wine, shoot the

dogs, and use the papers for musket

wadding.

MARION

His journals, letters, maps,

books...

ABNER

Colonel, we got a wagon full of

officer's uniforms and more powder

and muskets here.

MARION

Today was hard earned but a good

start.

MARION

In the future wounded British

soldiers will be given quarters.

DALTON

Like they gave quarter to my family?

My wife and three children were

hiding in our root cellar when they

came.  The Redcoats locked the door

and torched the house.

MARION

You have my sympathy... but the

order stands.

DALTON

And who are you to give an order

like that?  We all know what you did

after Fort Wilderness.

MARION

I'm your commanding officer.  This

is militia, not regular army.  I

can't hold you here, but as long as

you stay, you'll follow my orders.

REV. OLIVER

Thank you.

MARION

For what?

REV. OLIVER

For trying to impose some decency on

that sort.

MARION

Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one

of that sort.

BILLINGS

Am I one of that sort?

MARION

You're the worst of that sort.

You're the sort that gives that sort

a bad name.

MARION

I'm going to check the watch.

GABRIEL

He shouldn't make light.  That

Redcoat should not have been killed.

BILLINGS

He's not making light.

BILLINGS

You don't know him very well, do

you?

GABRIEL

He's my father.

GABRIEL

I know him well enough?

BILLINGS

Don't fault him for having grown up

on the frontier.  It was a harder

time and a harder place than you

know.

BILLINGS

Well?

MARION

I've just been inside the mind of a

genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more

about war than I could in a dozen

lifetimes.

BILLINGS

Cheerful news to greet the morn.

MARION

His victories at Charleston and

Camden were perfect, strategically,

tactically, logistically.  But he

has a weakness.

MARION

Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His

weakness is that he knows it.

GABRIEL

Father?

MARION

Pride is his weakness.

BILLINGS

Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.

MARION

Pride will do.

CORNWALLIS

Why am I here, Colonel Halbert?

MAJOR HALBERT

For the ball, sir?

CORNWALLIS

Why, after six weeks, are we still

here to attend a ball.  By now, we

should be attending balls in North

Carolina, not South Carolina.

MAJOR HALBERT

Our supply line, sir?

CORNWALLIS

Excellent guess, Major.

CORNWALLIS

And what, praytell, is this?

VALET

Uh... I borrowed it from Colonel

North.  I took it in at the back,

added wider epaulets, a court sash

and looped gold braiding on the

cuffs...

CORNWALLIS

It's a horse blanket.

(to Major Halbert)

First my personal baggage, then half

the bridges and ferries between here

and Charleston burned, a dozen

convoys attacked.  Colonel, if you

can't secure our supply line against

militia, how do you expect to do so

against Colonial regulars or the

French when they come?

COLONEL HALBERT

Sir, they're not like regulars, we

can't find them and we don't know

when or where they're going to

strike.

CORNWALLIS

How impolite.  And who leads these

clever, secretive fellows?

COLONEL HALBERT

We don't know, sir.  He's called,

the Commander by some, the Swamp Fox

by others.

CORNWALLIS

Colonel, I'm a civilized man but I'm

finding to difficult to remain

civil.  Secure my supply line.

COLONEL HALBERT

Yes, sir.

REDCOAT GUARD

Hey, what you got there?

BILLINGS

We got our own little party...

DALTON

To hell with the officers and their

fancy dress ball...

GUARD

Give us a nip, here.

MRS. TALBOT

No!  The beasts took your dogs, as

well?

CORNWALLIS

Fine animals, a gift from His

Majesty.  Dead now, for all I know.

MRS. TALBOT

Is there no decency?

MR. TALBOT

Among the rebels?  We know the

answer to that.

CORNWALLIS

Yes, we have learned.

MRS. TALBOT

You seem far away.

CORNWALLIS

It's the weight of command and the

lot of a widower -- memories,

loneliness...

(with a self-

deprecating laugh)

... and long gazes at the moon.

MRS. TALBOT

Oh, you poor man...

MAJOR HALBERT

Good God!

MR. TALBOT

These rebels seem to lack fear as

well as decency, eh, General?

CORNWALLIS

Colonel Tarleton, you deal with

these damned rebels.

TARLETON

Yes, sir.

GREEN

... four baskets of apples, salt

pork, sweet potatoes, jerky, hard

tack, salt and powder.  It's not

much, but I'll get you more.

MARION

We can't pay for this...

GREEN

I'll give you what I can, when I

can.  You pay me what you can.

GREEN

Francis, you remember my daughter,

Anne.

MARION

Nice to see you again, Anne.

ANNE

I know who you are, Gabriel Marion.

The last time I saw you, I was nine

and you put ink in my tea.

GABRIEL

I... uh... that wasn't me, it was

Samuel... I mean Nathan...

ANNE

It was you and it turned my teeth

black for a month.

GABRIEL

Uh... uh... I...

GREEN

He's sorry.  Come.

MARION

... and your terms of enlistment

will be month-to-month.  Every

thirty days you can re-enlist or

return to your families.

REED

I'm in.

MARION

Talk to Abner and Scott about

provisions, powder and mounts.

BILLINGS

Twenty men here, seventeen in New

Brighton, a dozen along the Black

River.  We'll pass three hundred by

week's end if this keeps up.

GABRIEL

If I'd known you were going to look

like this, I never would have put

ink in your tea.

ANNE

You call that a compliment?

GABRIEL

It's a start.

GABRIEL

They look nice.  As white as can be.

BILLINGS

He reminds me of you before you got

old and ugly.

MARION

(softly)

No, he takes after his mother...

MARION

... the younger ones barely remember

her but Gabriel spent more time with

Elizabeth... she taught him well,

guided him, she was his North Star

and mine... her father was a

minister, in Boston, did you know

that?

MARION

... Gabriel's already a better man

than I could ever hope to be...

MARION

What do you mean, old and ugly?

BILLINGS

You got me beat on both accounts.

MARION

The hell I do.

MARION

Gabriel?  Are you asleep?

GABRIEL

We're low on salt.  I should go to

Pembroke and get some.

BILLINGS

You got salt last week.

GABRIEL

Oh, right.

(beat)

Baking powder, we need baking

powder.

BILLINGS

We've got plenty of baking powder.

You went to Pembroke and got five

pounds two weeks ago.

REDCOAT SERGEANT

Halt.  Look alive, boys.

MARION

Sergeant, this road is closed.

Those wagons now belong to the

Continental Army.

REDCOAT SERGEANT

Ready arms!  By twos!

MARION

Sergeant, there's no reason for you

and your men to die.  Just leave the

wagons and go.

REDCOAT SERGEANT

Steady, boys...

REDCOAT SERGEANT

This is the King's highway and I

advise you and your men to make way.

(to his men)

Prepare to fire.

MARION

It's a trap...

REDCOAT SERGEANT

FIRE!

MARION

GO!

TARLETON

Which way?

GASKINS

This way... no this... I think...

TARLETON

HALT!

TARLETON

Enough of this.  There are other

ways to run down a fox.

GABRIEL

Father, no...

MARION

That's him.  Tarleton.

MARION

Damn you!  Let go!

GABRIEL

Father, please...

GABRIEL

Fourteen dead, eleven wounded,

eighteen captured.

MARION

I should have killed him when I had

the chance?

GABRIEL

When was that?  In the swamp at the

expense of your men?  Or when he

killed Thomas at the expense of your

family?

MARION

No...

GABRIEL

Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense

of our cause.

GABRIEL

There will be a time and a place for

revenge but killing Tarleton at the

expense of your duty serves no one

but yourself.

(beat)

Stay the course.

MARION

Stay the course... your mother used

to say that to me when I'd get drunk

or lose my temper.

GABRIEL

She'd say it to me when I picked on

Thomas or Nathan.

MARION

You learned her lessons better than

I.

GABRIEL

She got me at a more impressionable

age.

ANNE

Next time we'll bring more blankets.

GABRIEL

That would be nice.

ANNE

Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and

have just rain, no snow.

GABRIEL

That would be nice, too.

ANNE

Just because the French didn't come

this fall, doesn't mean they're

never going to come.

ROLLINS

They're to be hung!

GABRIEL

But they're prisoners-of-war!

REDCOAT SENTRY

Sir.

TARLETON

General, a message from the

commander of the rebel militia.

CORNWALLIS

It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have

a formal parley.

TARLETON

Are you going to meet with him?

CORNWALLIS

Most certainly.  Arrange it.

MAJOR HALBERT

Lord Cornwallis will be with you

presently.

MARION

Thank you.

MAJOR HALBERT

You may, of course, keep your

weapons, but I must warn you that...

MARION

(interrupting)

I'm familiar with appropriate

behavior at a military parley.

MAJOR HALBERT

Yes, quite, but you should know

that...

MARION

That will be all, Major.  I'll wait

for Lord Cornwallis.

MAJOR HALBERT

(coldly)

Yes... you will wait.

MARION

One other thing.

MARION

The proper form of address to a

superior officer, even one of an

opposing army, is "Yes, sir."

DISSOLVE TO:

CORNWALLIS

Jupiter!  Mars!

MARION

Go.

CORNWALLIS

My boys... my boys... you seem to

have been well fed.  Thank you for

that, Colonel.

MARION

My pleasure, sir.

CORNWALLIS

Please forgive me for keeping you

waiting.

MARION

Apology accepted.

CORNWALLIS

Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I

don't know your name.

MARION

Colonel will do.

CORNWALLIS

As you wish.

CORNWALLIS

Colonel... Colonel Banastre

Tarleton.

TARLETON

Colonel.

MARION

Shall we proceed?

CORNWALLIS

Let us.  Unless you object, I would

like to deem this meeting a formal

negotiation and, as such, there are

certain customary practices.

Perhaps I could explain them to

you...

MARION

I'm familiar with how a formal

negotiation is handled.

CORNWALLIS

Oh?

MARION

I served in His Majesty's army in

the French and Indian War.

CORNWALLIS

Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as

the initiating party, like to begin?

MARION

Unless you would like to claim

aggrieved status.

CORNWALLIS

You are familiar with how these

things are done.  In fact, I would

like to claim aggrieved status.

MARION

Very well, proceed, sir.

CORNWALLIS

First, you have in your possession

certain belongings of mine,

including clothing, private papers,

furniture and personal effects of a

non-military nature which I would

like to have returned to me.

MARION

I will do so as soon as possible.

CORNWALLIS

Thank you.

MARION

Please accept my apology for not

having done so sooner.

CORNWALLIS

Apology accepted.  Now, on the

matter of the specific targeting of

officers during engagements, this is

absolutely unacceptable.

MARION

That one is a bit more difficult.

CORNWALLIS

Certainly you must know that in

civilized warfare, officers in the

field must not be accorded

inappropriate levels of hostile

attention.

MARION

And what are inappropriate levels of

hostile attention?

CORNWALLIS

Colonel, imagine the utter chaos

that would result from un-led armies

having at each other.  There must be

gentlemen in command to lead and,

when appropriate, restrain their

men.

MARION

Restrain them from the targeting of

civilians, including women and

children?

CORNWALLIS

That is a separate issue.

MARION

I consider them linked.

CORNWALLIS

I beg to differ.  One is a command

decision on your part.  The other

represents nothing more than the

occasional over-exuberance of field

officers attempting to carry out

their duty in difficult

circumstances.

MARION

As long as your soldiers attack

civilians, I will order the shooting

of your officers at the outset of

every engagement.

(beat)

And my men are excellent marksmen.

CORNWALLIS

Very well, let us move on to...

MARION

Prisoner exchange.

CORNWALLIS

Sir?

MARION

You have eighteen of my men.  I want

them back.

CORNWALLIS

I do have eighteen criminals under

sentence of death, but I hold no

prisoners-of-war.

MARION

If that's your position, then

eighteen of your officers will die.

Nineteen, if you hang me with my

men.

CORNWALLIS

What officers?

MARION

In the clearing, just down from the

crest, to the left of the dark

pines...

CORNWALLIS

Their names, ranks and posts?

MARION

They refused to give me their names.

Their ranks are nine lieutenants,

five captains, three majors and one

fat colonel who called me a cheeky

fellow.  Their posts?  We picked

them up here-and-there last night.

CORNWALLIS

You are not a gentleman.

MARION

If your conduct is the measure of a

gentleman, I take that as a

compliment.

(coldly)

Get my men.

CORNWALLIS

Arrange the exchange.

MARION

Thank you, General.  I'm sure your

officers will thank you, as well.

MARION

You don't remember me, do you?

TARLETON

Ah, yes, that boy.

TARLETON

Ugly business, doing one's duty.

MARION

Yes, ugly business.

MARION

If you are alive when this war is

over, I'm going to kill you.

CORNWALLIS

Jupiter!  Mars!

TARLETON

Take a detachment and go get our

officers.

CORNWALLIS

This fox believes himself clever.

We shall see.

GASKINS

Nothing.

WILKINS

No one's been here for months.

TARLETON

But now we have a name for our

Colonel... Francis Marion.  And with

a name will come a family.

CAPTAIN MORROW

UPSTAIRS!

TARLETON

They can't be far.  Check the

outbuildings and the woods.

GABRIEL

It's all set.

CHARLOTTE

This will do fine.

CHARLOTTE

Thank you.

CHARLOTTE

So he's the one they talk about, the

Swamp Fox.

GABRIEL

Yes.

CHARLOTTE

I thought it might be him, the bits

and pieces we heard, a veteran,

fought in the French and Indian War,

knows the swamps.

GABRIEL

They won't stop looking for you and

the children.

CHARLOTTE

We'll be alright, here, for now.

(beat)

How is he?

GABRIEL

I don't know... I'm his son.

GABRIEL

These are for you and the children.

SUSAN

Why didn't father come?

CHARLOTTE

Speaking for months now.

SUSAN

Why didn't he come?

GABRIEL

He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't

leave his men.

SUSAN

He left us.

GABRIEL

I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll

come back as soon as he can.

GABRIEL

There are some letters here from

him.  Some are just to you.

SUSAN

I don't care.  I hate him.

GABRIEL

You don't hate him.

SUSAN

Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he

never comes back.

MARION

She spoke?  Susan spoke?

GABRIEL

Full sentences.  As if she had been

speaking all along.

MARION

I don't believe it... and I wasn't

there for it...

MARION

Tell me everything she said, word

for word.

GABRIEL

She said... she loves you and misses

you but she understands why you

can't be there with her.

MARION

She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said

that?

MARION

Isn't that something.

GABRIEL

Father, there's something else I

need to talk to you about.

MARION

What?

GABRIEL

Come with me.  I'll tell you when we

get there.

GABRIEL

Father, I'm looking for a best man.

MARION

I'd be honored.

REV. OLIVER

Dearly beloved, we are gathered here

in the sight of God to join this man

and this woman in holy matrimony...

GABRIEL

Sir, I'd like to request a furlough.

Two days?

MARION

Granted.  Where are you going?

GABRIEL

Cheraw Falls.

MARION

It's beautiful there.  Your mother

and I were there once, before you

were born.

GABRIEL

I know.

MARION

She would have been pleased.

ANNE

I'm sorry we didn't give you more

warning.

MARION

It's alright.  I'm very happy for

you.

MARION

It's a good measure of a woman that

she'll have her honeymoon under the

stars.

REV. OLIVER

For richer, for poorer, in sickness

and in health, 'til death do they

part.

CORNWALLIS

From General Clinton in New York...

(reading)

"... your request to move north is

denied until you have properly dealt

with your militia problem."

(aside)

He underlined, 'militia'.

(reading)

"You have spent over six months

dealing with a six-week problem.  It

is essential that you quell the

militia..."

(aside)

Underlined again.

(reading)

"... insurgency, particularly

because of the likely move south of

Washington and the inevitable

arrival of the French.  Militia, as

you have so often pointed out, is

not worth the attention of a

significant army, hence it is

mystifying why militia has bedeviled

you for so long..."

CORNWALLIS

(reading)

"... it is my fervent hope that the

vigor of your campaign comes to

match the vigor of your

correspondence with your

Parliamentary and Court patrons.

Only then might you share in the

victory, on the verge of which I now

stand."

(beat)

"Your guardedly respectful

Commander, General Sir George

Clinton."

CORNWALLIS

If I fail, you fail.

TARLETON

Perhaps.

CORNWALLIS

And if I triumph, you triumph.

TARLETON

Probably.

CORNWALLIS

How can we end this madness?

TARLETON

Difficult, sir.  This is, as you

pointed out, a civil war.

CORNWALLIS

Civility is a secondary virtue.  It

is superseded by duty.

TARLETON

I understand, sir.

TARLETON

I believe they are almost ready.

GASKINS

I'm sorry, sir.  He died.

TARLETON

Very well, get one of the others.

BILLINGS

Damn your eyes.  Do your worst.

TARLETON

I intend to.

DALTON

You still want me to give wounded

Redcoats quarter?

GABRIEL

Tarleton has a list of our men, most

are on it.  A regiment of dragoons

is going to the homes on the list,

burning them, killing whomever

resists, women and children, as

well.

MARION

Where?

GABRIEL

Seven homes along the Black River so

far...

REV. OLIVER

It's not time for vengeance, it's

time to mourn and...

MARION

Five day furlough for all men.

Abner, Dan, Reverend, spread the

word.  We'll reform at Acworth.  Any

man who doesn't come back won't be

thought a coward or uncommitted to

the cause.  Attend to your families.

MARGARET (O.S.)

It's him!  I told you it was him!

NATHAN

Father!

WILLIAM

Papa...

MARION

Thank you.

MARION

Susan...

MARGARET

I told you, things would get better.

MARION

The overlook, up there should be

where you post the watch.  Work out

a schedule.  Short watches,

especially at night.

(pointing)

If you can catch some of those

mockingbirds you can make cages and

put them along there for alarms.

(motioning for them

to follow)

Now let's find someplace to cache

extra weapons...

MARION

Good apple.

MARION

Very good.  Sweet.

ANNE

May I ask you a question?

MARION

Yes, of course.

ANNE

Do you think Frances with an "e" is

too manly a name for a girl?

MARION

No.

ANNE

Do you think Francis with an "i" is

too womanly a name for a boy?

MARION

No.

ANNE

Good.

MARION

When?

ANNE

Late summer.

MARION

Congratulations.

ANNE

Thank you.

CHARLOTTE

I'm not my sister.

MARION

Excuse me?

CHARLOTTE

I said, I'm not my sister.

MARION

I know that.

CHARLOTTE

Do you?

MARION

Of course, I do.

CHARLOTTE

(irritated)

Very well, then.

MARION

Just a little goodbye?  One word?

That's all I want to hear.

MARION

Goodbye, Charlotte.

CHARLOTTE

Goodbye.

SUSAN

Papa!

SUSAN

Papa, don't go, I'll say anything.

SUSAN

Please, Papa, I'll say anything you

want!

SUSAN

Just tell me what to say!  Tell me

what to say!

SUSAN

Please, Papa, please don't go.

SUSAN

... I'll talk to you, I'll say

anything you want, just tell me what

you want me to say, I'll say

anything, I promise, please, Papa,

just stay...

MARION

I'll come back... I promise...

MARION

How many came back?

REV. OLIVER

About a hundred and twenty.  Less

than a third.

REDCOAT SERGEANT

Excuse me, Ma'am, everyone has been

requested to gather at the church.

ANNE

Everyone?

REDCOAT SERGEANT

Colonel Tarleton wants to address,

the whole village.

REDCOAT

Into the church, please.

ANOTHER REDCOAT

Colonel Tarleton wishes to address

all of you.

VOICE

Open this door!

ANOTHER VOICE

By what right are we made prisoners?

WILKINS

Sir?

TARLETON

Yes, Major.

WILKINS

Sir, there is no honor in this.

TARLETON

The honor is found in the end, not

the means.  This will be forgotten.

(to Gaskins)

Proceed.

GABRIEL

Anne...?

MARION

Don't go in there.

GABRIEL

Is it her?  Is Anne in there?

MARION

She is.  Don't go in there.

GABRIEL

Father, tell me what happened at

Fort Wilderness?

MARION

You know what happened.

GABRIEL

No, I don't.

MARION

Everyone knows.  It's what made me a

hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I

got a medal.  Men bought me drinks.

They still do sometimes.  Everyone

knows what happened.

GABRIEL

Tell me what everyone doesn't know.

MARION

And what do they know?

GABRIEL

That the French and Cherokees

captured the fort and when you

retook it, you took revenge on them

for what they did during the

occupation.

MARION

That's right.

GABRIEL

That's not enough.  Tell me.

MARION

Your mother asked me the same

question around the time you were

born.  I was drunk and I was foolish

enough to answer her.

MARION

That's why it was four years between

you and Thomas.  It took me that

long to regain her respect.

GABRIEL

I'm not my mother.  I can't have the

respect without the knowing.

MARION

It was in '63.  It was a bad time.

The French and the Cherokee had

raided along the Blue Ridge.  All

the English settlers took refuge at

Fort Wilderness but the French

captured it.  We were sent in

relief.  Harry Lee, Billings, sixty

of us.  We already had something of

a reputation for being... harsh.

When we got there the fort was

abandoned.  Not a French soldier or

Cherokee anywhere.  They had left a

week earlier.  What we found was...

bad.

MARION

They had left the settlers there.

The men had been burned alive, the

women were in pieces and the

children were on stakes.

MARION

We buried them, then we went to

track.  It was a cold trail and they

were moving fast.  We went faster.

We caught up to them at Kentucky

Ford.

GABRIEL

Go on.

MARION

We took our time with them and gave

every one of them worse than they

had given at the fort.  It was two

weeks before they were all dead, all

except two.  We put the heads on a

pallet and had the two we let live

take it to the French at Fort

Ambercon.

(beat)

The eyes, fingers and tongues we put

in a basket and sent that down the

Asheulot to the Cherokee.

(beat)

The French stayed east of the Blue

Ridge after that and the Cherokee

broke their treaty with the French

and stayed out of the fight.

(beat)

That seemed to make a difference.

The war went another year, things

went better... and men bought us

drinks.

MARION

It was a different time, son.  And

you're a better man than that.

GABRIEL

I see, do as I say, not as I do.

MARION

Yes.

ABNER

THEY'RE HERE!  CONTINENTALS, THEY'RE

HERE!

MARION

If this war is about more than

Thomas, it's about more than Anne,

as well.  Stay the course.

GABRIEL

As you did at Fort Wilderness?

LEE

Look at you!  I knew you could do

it!

LEE

We have a chance!  Better than a

chance!  Cornwallis is running to

the Chesapeake, probably to meet his

fleet at Yorktown.  I wish I could

see his face when he sees a dozen

French ships floating there.  And

Washington should be a day or two

behind him.

(beat)

And on top of everything, I have a

son!  Born last month in Alexandria.

MARION

His wife was killed yesterday.  She

was with child.

LEE

I'm sorry, I didn't know.

DALTON

Gabriel and at least a dozen others.

They must have left right after the

watch change.

MARION

That means they have two hours on

us.

BROTHER JOSEPH

Fifty Green Dragoons, camped about a

quarter mile from here.  Sentries at

four points.

WILKINS

FIRE!

GABRIEL

I'm alright, I...

MARION

Let me help you...

DALTON

Colonel...

REV. OLIVER

May I help you try to find solace

with the word of God?

REV. OLIVER

Colonel, let us help his soul find

it's place with the Almighty and...

MARION

He looks as if he's sleeping,

doesn't he?

REV. OLIVER

Yes, he does.

LEE

You have to bury him.

LEE

I'll help you bury him.

MARION

Don't touch him.

LEE

How many men have we seen die?

MARION

Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.

LEE

They're gone.  And there is nothing

you or I can do to bring them back.

But there is something you can do to

help end all this.

MARION

It is ended.

LEE

No.  It's not over yet.  Two days

ride, Yorktown, Virginia.

Washington, the French, Cornwallis

and Tarleton.  It will end, one way

or another.

(beat)

Francis, nothing will replace your

sons but helping us will justify

their sacrifice.

RUNNER

You called for me, sir?

MARION

Take this to General Washington.

WASHINGTON

Did you bring me this?

RUNNER

Yes, sir.

WASHINGTON

Take this to Colonel Marion.

RUNNER

Yes, sir.

MARION

Colonel Francis Marion.

MARION

Gray.

WASHINGTON

Earned.

WASHINGTON

Come.  I have something I want to

show you.

WASHINGTON

Gentlemen.

WASHINGTON

I was sorry to hear about your son.

MARION

I lost another a year ago, Thomas.

He was only fifteen.

WASHINGTON

I've had no sons to lose, nor

daughters.

(beat)

I lose the sons of other men.

WASHINGTON

Life was easier when we only had

ourselves to get killed.

WASHINGTON

Gentlemen, what do we see?

HAMILTON

Mortars, center, with two lines of

enfilading trenches.

PINKNEY

More along the right flank and

behind the forward redoubts.

LAFAYETTE

A formidable defensive position.

Very formidable.

HAMILTON

They could hold out for weeks.

WASHINGTON

Francis, tell me about General

Cornwallis.

MARION

Remember Braddock?

WASHINGTON

That bad?

MARION

Worse.

WASHINGTON

Proud, priggish and competent.  A

very bad combination in an

adversary.

WASHINGTON

For those of you who don't know, we

intercepted a British dispatch this

morning.  General Clinton has sailed

from New York to relieve Cornwallis.

HAMILTON

How long before they arrive?

WASHINGTON

Less than a week.  Sixteen ships and

over nine thousand Redcoats.

LAFAYETTE

Sooner or later that message will

get through to Cornwallis.

PINKNEY

And when it does, he'll just wait us

out.

WASHINGTON

And when the British ships arrive,

the French ships will flee.  And

when the French ships flee, General

Rochambeau and the French troops

will flee as well.

MARION

Then you must let the message go

through.

WASHINGTON

If Cornwallis receives news that

Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold

tight and wait.  He'll fight a

purely defensive battle and he'll

win that.

MARION

No, he won't.  There are two things

you need to know about Cornwallis.

First, he is a very proud man, He

would rather risk defeat than share

a victory.

(beat)

If you give him what he thinks is an

out, he'll take it.

WASHINGTON

And what is the second thing?

MARION

I'll let him tell you himself...

(reading)

"... but it is this colonial militia

that is the most irksome.  Not

worthy of my attention, but

demanding it; not worthy of British

blood, but taking it; and not worthy

of a soldier's honor, but sullying

it.  Those nights of mine that are

not sleepless, are filled with

dreams of a cavalry charge on the

heels of fleeing farmers..."

MARION

He has no respect for citizen

soldiers.  That's your bait...

militia.

MAJOR HALBERT

Sir, a dispatch from General Clinton

made it through the rebel lines.

WILKINS

Sir?

CORNWALLIS

Call a general staff meeting.

AIDE

Yes, sir.

MARION

The British army believes in

officers.  I believe in soldiers.

After we engage, there will be no

more orders.  Every man here must

know what I'm about to tell you.

MARION

We are the bait in a trap.  We're

militia.  Cornwallis thinks we're

rabble, nothing more than a bunch of

undisciplined farmers.  And if he

thinks that's what we are, that's

what we're going to give him.

Listen up.

CORNWALLIS

Do you see that, Colonel?

TARLETON

Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see

irregulars at their center.

CORNWALLIS

Fix bayonets... dispatch the Green

Dragoons.

DALTON

COLONEL!  OUR LINE!

DALTON

OUR LINE IS FALTERING...

LEE

Goodbye, Francis.

MARION

Goodbye, Harry.

MARION

And congratulations on the birth of

your son.

LEE

Thank you.  Maybe all of this will

buy him some peace.

MARION

I hope so.

MARION

Your son, what did you name him?

LEE

Robert.  Robert E. Lee.

MARION

A good name for a farmer.

MARION

Two pounds, fourteen ounces.

CHARLOTTE

Lovely.

SUSAN

Wait for me...

MARION (O.S.)

Damnation!

FADE OUT.

THE END
