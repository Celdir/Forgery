FADE IN:

1   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                          1

It is 1957, and we are in the deserts of Utah. TONY

BENNETT sings "Rags to Riches" on the SOUNDTRACK.

Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a

highway.

The CAMERA MOVES to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors

up a hill. Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile-

per-hour pace. Two cars decide to ignore safety and

cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car.

2   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - PARALLEL TIME                        2

Two people are in the straining car -- a woman and her

son. The woman is CAROLINE WOLFF. Somewhere in her 30s,

she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works

at it. (Just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a

fading bruise on her right cheekbone.) She is bright and

energetic and lively. Even more important than these

qualities, though, is her humor. And most important of

all is a sensual quality she exudes. Her sensuality is

effortless -- as natural to her as the color of her eyes

and hair. Men turn on the street to stare at her.

The boy is TOBY WOLFF. A    pleasant-faced boy with won-

derful eyes, he is 13 --   teetering on the brink of

adolescence, so that one   moment he seems like a self-

assured teenager, and the   very next like a ten-year-old

kid.

Just now the ten-year-old kid has the upper hand: bored

and weary with the long trip, Toby has been arguing with

Caroline, who is ignoring him.

TOBY

... Well,  I mean it. I'm serious

-- I do.   You promise and promise,

and then  you change your mind,

just like  that.

CAROLINE

(totally oblivious)

... Uh-huh.

TOBY

You wait 'til you ask me for

something. Just wait. See if you

get it.

(CONTINUED)

CAROLINE

(as above)

Toby, hush. Let me just...

So concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish

her sentence, she nurses the car upward. Finally the car

crests the hill and starts down. Caroline sighs with

relief. She turns to Toby with a smile.

CAROLINE

What'd you say?

TOBY

I said -- for the twentieth time

-- if a person promises somebody

something, they can't just turn

around and take it back.

CAROLINE

Oh, honey, Jesus. Don't start

with that again.

TOBY

Why not?

CAROLINE

Because I'm the mother, and I

get to tell you what to do every

minute of your life 'til you're

eighteen. Seriously, we've got no

money. I can't buy you the

moccasins.

TOBY

I bet if you'd promised Roy some

moccasins he'd of got 'em.

CAROLINE

No talk about Roy, okay? And ditto

the moccasins. We, can't, afford,

them.

TOBY

Yeah, but you did promise...

CAROLINE

Sue me. Take me to court. Oh,

Toby, I know you're disappointed,

but...

TOBY

Jack.   Call me Jack.

(CONTINUED)

2   CONTINUED:   (2)                                            2

CAROLINE

You're going to drive me to an

early grave: I'm never going to

make Salt Lake City.

TOBY

Seriously. If a person can't get

a stinking miserable pair of

moccasins, at least he ought to be

able to choose his own name...

(loud)

... and I wanna be called Jack!

CAROLINE

Fine.  And you can call me...

(she thinks)

... Jeanette. Jeanette Marie.

TOBY

Oh, you're so stupid sometimes,

I...

The BAWLING of an AIRHORN interrupts him. Both of them

look through the back window and see a huge tractor-

trailer truck, out of control, bearing down on them.

Caroline brakes and steers a hard right, SKIDDING the

NASH safely onto the side of the road.

The truck, its HORN BLASTING steadily, shimmies and

slides past them, and then, hideously, fails to make the

next curve: it smashes through the guard rails and into

empty space, its HORN still BLARING.

Caroline and Toby look at each other, then scramble out

of the car.

3   EXT. BROKEN GUARD RAIL - DAY                                3

Other drivers have stopped to look: hundreds of feet

below, the truck lies on its back among boulders.

Caroline glances, then turns away. She pulls Toby

away, one arm around his shoulder.

4   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - MINUTES LATER                        4

Caroline fills the Nash's steaming radiator with a can of

water.

CAROLINE

(not much heat)

Goddamn thing.

(CONTINUED)

4.

4   CONTINUED:                                          4

She glances back to where a larger crowd of people stare

avidly down at the truck. She bites her lip.

CAROLINE

Oh, that poor man.

There is a pause.   Then Toby speaks:

TOBY

I hope to hell this isn't some

kind of omen.

Caroline turns to Toby, her face worried. Then she sees

the look in Toby's eyes -- he's ragging her. She grins

and gives his shoulder a light, affectionate shove.

5   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - NIGHT                               5

Toby (feet up on the dashboard wearing a brand-new pair

of Indian moccasins) and Caroline sing "Mood Indigo"

together. Toby holds  a complicated-looking, black con-

traption which looks something like an antique flashlight.

TOBY

How's this thing work, anyway?

CAROLINE

(not confident)

It makes a black light that, uh,

causes uranium traces to glow.

TOBY

And we just walk along the street

and find this glowing uranium?

CAROLINE

Well, it was everywhere in Moab,

they say -- just like gold in the

gold-rush days.

TOBY

But we were too late in Moab, and

that guy at the office said

nobody'd found any uranium in Salt

Lake City.

CAROLINE

Well, that means we'll have the

place pretty much to ourselves,

huh? Honey, this could be a big

break for us. If this works out,

oh, just think: we'll get us a

house, get rid of this damn Nash

Ambassador -- no money worries...

It'll be like heaven on a June day.

5.

6   INT. CAR - DAWN                                           6

We hear "MOOD INDIGO" on the car RADIO and see that a

weary Caroline has driven through the night and Toby is

slumped against the passenger door. Toby stirs, then

opens his eyes.

CAROLINE

Ask me how far we are from Salt

Lake City.

Toby is instantly awake, excited. Caroline points to a

small highway sign and both she and Toby yell out.

CAROLINE/TOBY

Forty-seven miles to go!

Both of them are laughing with excitement. Toby claps

his hands together once, very hard, and Caroline yells --

7   EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING                                    7

Well, hell. The Nash Ambassador sits by the side of the

road, its hood up, its radiator steaming. Caroline and

Toby sit in a patch of shade by the car.

CAROLINE

If I could have one wish right

now -- only one wish -- you know

what I'd like? I'd like to burn

this damn Nash Ambassador to a

crisp.

(as Toby laughs)

I'm serious. I hate it. I hate

the factory that produced it, and

I hate the man who invented it.

TOBY

It almost makes me want to see Roy

-- he was the only one could make

the thing stop overheating.

(a beat)

My God, he was boring. Boring and

mean: you sure got crappy taste in

boyfriends.

At the mention of Roy's name, Caroline lightly touches

the bruise on her right cheekbone. Not enjoying the talk

about Roy, she pours the water into the radiator, and

speaks directly to the car.

CAROLINE

I'd like to burn you to the ground.

(to Toby; big smile)

Let's go get rich in Salt Lake

City!

MAN

You're pulling my leg, right?

CAROLINE

No, I came here to look for

uranium.

MAN

My God, lady. If you're looking

for uranium, why didn't you go to

Moab?

CAROLINE

We went there, but everybody'd

beaten us there. We were too late.

MAN

So you came here just on the

chance you'd find uranium?

Listen, you mind me saying

something to you might sound rude?

Lady, you got more courage than

you got common sense.

12   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - TWENTY MINUTES LATER             12

TOBY

That mechanic in Colorado said it

needed points.

CAROLINE

I know. Don't tell me what I

already know. This thing's a

bottomless pit. I don't know what

to do. No matter how much money I

pour into it...

WOMAN

I'd rather be whipped with a belt

than have car trouble. 'Course

these days I don't have to worry

about that. My husband got laid

off at the mill, and they

repossessed the car, so wherever

I wanna go, I just have to hoof

it, you know?

CAROLINE

You don't have    a car?

(as the    Woman

shakes    her head)

You want this    one?

WOMAN

I... uh... I...

TOBY

You're gonna give our car away?

CAROLINE

(to the Woman)

Seriously. It needs points, and

it overheats constantly, but you

can have it if you want it,

because my hand to God, I can't

look at it one more minute.

WOMAN

Well, sure...

(CONTINUED)

12   CONTINUED:                                              12

CAROLINE

Get the bags out. Get the owner's

slip out of the glove compartment.

We're rid of this son-of-a-bitch

pink and white albatross. You

don't mind taking a car with a big

dent in the passenger door?

WOMAN

Hell, no.

(she looks)

There's no dent there...

CAROLINE

Oh, yes there is!

WOMAN

... you really just giving me this

car?

CAROLINE

It's done. It's yours. You got

yourself a Nash Ambassador!

(to Toby)

Let's go!

13   EXT. CITY STREET - DAY (FEW MINUTES LATER)                   13

CAROLINE

... find ourselves a cheap room

someplace, we'll get you into

school, I'll brush up on my typing

and get a job, and things'll start

looking up. I feel it: the good

times are coming. And at least

we're rid of that damn Nash

Ambassador!

TOBY

Yeah, and like Dad used to say,

'We may be broke, but we're never

poor.' And later, if we get a

house with a big yard, I could

get a collie, you know? One like

Lad or Grey Dawn. And someday

maybe a palomino. And I'm going

to try harder in school, too...

14   INT. VICE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY                            14

VICE PRINCIPAL

... like to give new boys the

benefit of the doubt, but this

is the second time in two weeks

that you've been in front of me,

and I don't like that.

(picks up a telephone)

Now I think you better just call

your mother and tell her to come

down here.

TOBY

She works.   She's working.

15   EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON                                       15

TOBY

It wasn't me broke their stupid

windows.

CAROLINE

Liar.

TOBY

Gee, thanks a lot, Mom -- believe

them instead of me.

CAROLINE

If you care anything about me at

all, you'll shut up.

(CONTINUED)

10.

15    CONTINUED:                                              15

TOBY

Yeah, well if you'd stayed married

to Dad none of this would've ever

happened.

CAROLINE

Look, don't you put that    on my

back: I can't make your     father

call you. I can't make     your

brother write you. They     dumped

you. Yes. But it's not      my fault.

16    INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S ROOM - AFTERNOON                     16

The place is pretty bleak: a room and a half, Murphy

beds, linoleum floors, and a bath down the hall.

Caroline and Toby enter. She pulls down the Murphy

bed and falls onto it fully dressed, saying:

CAROLINE

My head is killing me.

Toby heads for his room.

16A   SAME SCENE - DUSK                                       16A

Caroline wakes up with a start, then sees Toby sitting

in a chair, watching her.

CAROLINE

What time is it?

TOBY

Seven.    Almost.

CAROLINE

Why didn't you wake me?

TOBY

I started dinner. The potatoes

are frying, and I'm heating up the

hot dogs.

Caroline sees that he's trying to make it up to her, and

pats the bed for him to sit down next to her. He moves

to sit beside her.

CAROLINE

Hold your mother's hand.

(CONTINUED)

11.

16A   CONTINUED:                                            16A

TOBY

I'm sorry.

CAROLINE

I know you are, honey. Ah, well

-- it wasn't fire, and nobody

bled, so I guess we're okay.

The TELEPHONE RINGS and she answers it.   When she hears

the VOICE on the other end she once again  touches her

right cheekbone with a finger -- the spot  where the

bruise had been. She sags back against a   wall.

CAROLINE

Yes...

(listens)

Yes...

(listens)

Yes, I know...

(listens)

You're right...

(listens)

All right, yes... in an hour,

then.

Caroline hangs up.

TOBY

Who was that?

She closes her eyes.

TOBY

Who was that?

Caroline laughs aloud, then slides down the wall until

she's on the floor still laughing.

CAROLINE

We've got a guest for dinner:

it's Roy. He tracked us down.

Toby groans and falls full-length onto the sofa.

17    INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S KITCHEN - ONE HOUR LATER           17

Caroline, Toby and ROY are eating at the tiny table. Roy

is good-looking in a meaty, hairy-chested sort of way.

Though he is on his very best behavior just now, there is

a mean streak in him.

Toby, delighted, holds a Winchester .22 rifle across his

lap -- a peace-making gift from Roy.

(CONTINUED)

12.

17   CONTINUED:                                               17

ROY

... I found me a room, but it's

clear the hell and gone 'cross

town. And I think I got a job

lined up doin' tune-ups in a

Texaco station. How you like it

at Winstead's?

CAROLINE

How do you know where I work?

ROY

I been here almost a week.

CAROLINE

You followed me around?    For a

week? Watching?

CAROLINE

And how did you ever find me?

ROY

You like the rifle, Toby?    'Jack,'

I mean.

TOBY

It's the best present I ever got.

I just love it.

(to Caroline)

I'm going to pretend I'm shooting.

CAROLINE

Don't point that thing at anybody

or I won't teach you to shoot.

TOBY

It's not loaded!

CAROLINE

You heard me:    anybody or any

thing.

TOBY

It's got no bullets, for God's

sake.

CAROLINE

Don't make me speak to you again.

(CONTINUED)

I'll point it at the sky, then.

18   INT. LIVING ROOM - TWO HOURS LATER                           18

CAROLINE

Don't.   Toby's still up.

ROY

You are one sweet thing, baby:

just the sight of you makes my

dick hard.

ROY

Aw, he won't hear anything.

ROY

Shit, baby, I'm sorry. I didn't

mean that. I'm just so glad to

see you.

Hi.

TOBY

Hello.

WOMAN #1

My Lord, look at the eyes on

him -- won't he be a heartbreaker

in three, four years?

WOMAN #2

Bedroom eyes.

WOMAN #1

You live in the neighborhood,

sweetie?

TOBY

Over there.

(a beat)

I won't be here long, though,

'cause my dad's coming to get me.

WOMAN #1

Oh, yes?

TOBY

Yeah. I'm gonna live on his

ranch in Phoenix. The "Lazy B,"

it's called.

WOMAN #2

That sounds like fun.

TOBY

It is. I've got a palomino horse

and a collie, and Dad lets us go

on hunts all by ourselves. He

gave me this Winchester .22, and

last year I shot a mountain lion

with it. And Lad -- that's my

dog -- found a nest of rattlesnakes

one time, and killed all twelve

of them...

21   INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S ROOMS - AFTERNOON (SAME DAY)21

TOBY

What're you doing home so --

(as he sees

suitcases)

We going someplace?

CAROLINE

We sure are.

TOBY

Where?

CAROLINE

I don't know.    Got any suggestions?

TOBY

Phoenix.

CAROLINE

Good. I was thinking of Phoenix

or Seattle -- lots of opportunities

in both those places.

TOBY

What about your fabulous

boyfriends? What about the

fabulous, boring Roy? Is he

coming, too?

CAROLINE

Not if I can help it. I looked

out the window at work today, and

he was parked across the street,

watching.

TOBY

Roy's so uncool. So boring.

CAROLINE

You liked him well enough last

night.

(imitating Toby)

'Oh, Roy, I just love my rifle

so much! It's the bestest present

ever!'

TOBY

Oh, shut up.

TOBY

Now? We're going now?     What about

all the food?

CAROLINE

Leave it.

TOBY

Even the canned stuff?

CAROLINE

Leave it!

Leaves in nine minutes.

CAROLINE

... I've always had a good head

for figures, and if I could get

my C.P.A. license, I believe we

could make a real go of it in

Seattle. I'll advertise for

roommates, and I bet we find us

a real cute house to rent.

TOBY

If there's a big yard, can I get

a collie?

CAROLINE

Sure. Oh, honey, I feel a wind

at my back: I think this is

going to work out good.

TOBY

(as they board

bus)

Yeah -- like heaven on a June day.

CAROLINE (O.S.)

... and if you cut school again

I'll just wear you out -- do you

hear me? I'm tired of it!

TOBY (O.S.)

Yeah, yeah...

Toby exits the house.

But, Jesus, what a new Toby: he's turned cool. A few

months have passed.  He now wears T-shirts and jeans

which ride way low on his hips. As he walks along, he

combs his hair into a duck's ass in back, and forward

into a curl at the center of his forehead. He's 1957 hip

-- or thinks he is.  He strolls on, feeling cool.

24A   EXT. TRACT HOUSE/FURTHER DOWN STREET - AFTERNOON          24A

From one of the houses TERRY TAYLOR emerges, falling into

step with Toby. He's Toby's age, and is almost an exact

replica of him.

TOBY

Hey, Terry.

TERRY TAYLOR

Hey, Jack. What'd your mom say

about skipping school today?

TOBY

Who listens?

TERRY TAYLOR

You go over to Wanda's house last

night?

(as Toby nods)

You make out good?

(as Toby nods again)

How good?

TOBY

I fucked her 'til her nose bled.

TERRY TAYLOR

Sure you did!    Oh, Wolff, you're

rich.

for you.

TERRY TAYLOR

Man, look at her! Look at that

body-y-y-y.

TERRY SILVER

(continues licking

screen)

Um-m-m-m. M-M-M. Oh, Annette, I

want you. I want you so bad.

TOBY

Oh, babybabybabybabybaby...

You make my dick hard!

THREE OF THEM

Yum, yum, yum.

20.

27    CONTINUED:                                             27

Making wet kissing noises, or just rocking their heads

back and forth as if tempted beyond endurance. Then,

slowly, they shut up and lie back down.

27A   SAME SCENE - LATER                                           27A

And this is what they really wanted: absolutely silent,

all three boys stare fixedly at the screen. They are

totally absorbed, caught up in the sweetness and warmth

of the show.

Not one of these boys has ever touched a girl's breast;

all three are at least two years from their first shave;

all three are pre-pubescent, and their sexuality is all

bravado -- now we see them for what they are: three

skinny-armed 13-year-olds, fascinated by Superman.

28    INT. TOBY AND CAROLINE'S KITCHEN - DUSK                      28

Caroline pirouettes for her two roommates, KATHY, a

diffident, sweet-faced young woman, and MARIAN, a

heavyset, loud, red-faced woman who eats compulsively

from a package of oatmeal cookies. Both of the women ooh

and aah over Caroline's dress.

KATHY

That belt just makes it.

CAROLINE

It does pick up the green, doesn't

it?

MARIAN

And you say he's getting serious

already?

CAROLINE

Yes, I think. He keeps talking

about marriage, keeps saying he

wants to meet Toby.

MARIAN

Well, that's it -- three dates and

you got 'im good.

Don't want who?

KATHY

(about Toby)

Little pitchers...

MARIAN

Well, it's the tough guy who can't

be bothered to go to school.

CAROLINE

(to Toby)

Oh, it's nothing -- we were

talking about Dwight. I told you

about Dwight.

TOBY

He the one drives down from the

boondocks? The mechanic? Dwight.

What a stupid name.

(he draws the name

out)

Dwiiiight. Duhhhhwight.

Dwight-tah-h-h-h. Dwighttahhhhh.

CAROLINE

Would you like coffee before we

go? Or a Coke?

DWIGHT

You know, I believe I could stand

a cup of java.

DWIGHT

So you're Toby.

TOBY

No.

DWIGHT

You're not Toby?

TOBY

No.

CAROLINE

Oh, he wants to be called 'Jack.'

It's so silly... ever since he

read Jack London.

DWIGHT

Well, I'll call him anything he

wants.

(to Toby,

confidential)

I always say people can call me

anything they want, long as they

don't call me late for supper!

DWIGHT

So, Jack, you like school?

TOBY

No.

MARIAN

He might like it if he ever went

there and tried it.

TOBY

Oh, have another cookie, Marian --

keep your strength up.

MARIAN

I'd like to just yank that nasty

tongue of yours out by the roots.

CAROLINE

(to Dwight, light)

My son's decided to try to drive

me into an early grave. Truly.

You straighten up and be polite,

you hear me?

DWIGHT

Who made this?

CAROLINE

I did...

DWIGHT

Well, well, well, all I can say is

that you people are pretty lucky

to live in a house where -- oh.

KATHY

I hear you're invited up to

Dwight's next week for

Thanksgiving.

DWIGHT

Aw, you'll love it. Great air,

great water. For scenery, all you

have to do is step outside your

front door and open your eyes.

And there's a turkey shoot

Thanksgiving Day. Your mom said

you might like it, so I signed you

up.

TOBY

Really? I can shoot my Winchester?

Great! I bet I could be the one

to get the turkey.

Okay.

CAROLINE

Welcome to beautiful Concrete!

Please be nice.

DWIGHT (V.O.)

... air like wine at my place, and

I don't mind saying I wouldn't

live anywhere else, and that's the

God's honest truth. There's good

schools, honest people, and some

of the best fishing in the world.

Ted Williams -- you like baseball,

Toby? That is, Jack, I mean --

you like baseball? 'Cause Ted

Williams, whom I believe is one of

the all-time greats, is also a

world-class angler. Many's the

(a beat)

Hunting, too: there's game

everywhere you look. I don't

think I flatter myself by saying

that I'm something of a whiz with

a rifle, and Concrete gives me

every opportunity to prove it...

32    EXT. SMALL BRIDGE - DAY                                      32

The three stand by the edge of the bridge, looking down

into the water.

They see salmon fighting the last few yards of their

yearly battle to spawn. Against the rapid current, they

leap again and again. Long strips of flesh hang from

their bodies.

DWIGHT

They always show you salmon

fighting to get upstream, but they

never show you what they look like

when they get there.

Her face strained, Caroline leans over for a closer look.

The salmon swim in slow, stunned circles, some with an

eye missing or hanging by a membrane, a hideous sight.

CAROLINE

It's pitiful.     Awful.

DWIGHT

They'll spawn, and then they'll

die. They're dying now.

As Toby and Caroline move to the passenger side of the

car, Toby speaks so Dwight can't hear:

TOBY

I hope to hell it's not an omen.

Caroline has to fight back a smile.

A33   EXT. CONCRETE SILO - DAY                               A33

Concrete silo where "Welcome To Concrete" is painted in

huge faded letters.

DWIGHT

So here we go. Welcome to

Concrete. Dwight's home sweet

home. Finest people in the whole

state of Washington, you ask me.

Lots of churches, too. A neighbor

of mine says, "Looking for nice

churches, come to Concrete.

Looking for sin, go to hell." I

think that's funny...

Caroline and Toby are severely underimpressed with their

first impression of Concrete.

33    EXT. DWIGHT'S HOUSE - DAY                                   33

Dwight's Buick pulls to a stop; Dwight, Caroline, and

Toby get out. The scenery is as beautiful as Dwight said

it was.

DWIGHT

All the houses are converted Army

barracks, made into duplexes --

Three children exit the    house. SKIPPER, a pleasant boy

who is average in every    way, is 17. NORMA is 18, slow-

spoken and sensual, Toby    cannot take his eyes off her.

The third is PEARL, two    years younger than Toby. Pearl

has a bald spot the size    of a dollar, high on the side of

her head.

DWIGHT

Well. Let's see here. Kids, this

is my pretty friend, Caroline

Wolff, and her boy To...

Okay, so that was the living room;

over here is the kitchen -- I plan

on getting all new fixtures in

Fine.                          Yeah, it's fine.

NORMA

It's a little isolated, is all.

DWIGHT

Not that isolated.

NORMA

Well, maybe not that isolated.

Pretty isolated, though.

DWIGHT

Aw, there's plenty to do in

Concrete if you kids would take a

little initiative. When I was

growing up we didn't have T.V. --

we used our imaginations. We read

the classics. We played musical

instruments. You show me a bored

kid, I'll show you a lazy kid.

CAROLINE

I didn't know you played an

instrument, Dwight. What do you

play?

DWIGHT

Sax.   Tenor sax.

Chinook.

NORMA

Chinook High.

DWIGHT

It's a few miles downriver.

SKIPPER

Forty miles.

DWIGHT

Come off it -- it's not that far.

SKIPPER

Yeah, I clocked it: thirty-nine

Ah, you'd bellyache if the goddam

TOBY

No, it's just regulation paper

targets. It's a test of skill.

And, Jack, I just found out

yesterday that they won't let

kids shoot.

TOBY

But you said I could!

DWIGHT

I know, but they got it all

screwed up somehow and told me

wrong at first.

CAROLINE

Dwight, you did tell him.

Caroline, who is sleeping on the sofa bed, returns from

the bathroom. She sees that Toby's awake on his pallet

on the floor. She sits on the floor beside him. (The

whole conversation is conducted in whispers.)

CAROLINE

So what do you think?

TOBY

They're okay. What's that bald

spot on Pearl's head? Ugh.

CAROLINE

Some sort of infection.

TOBY

Norma's nice.

CAROLINE

They're all nice, but Dwight keeps

rushing me, keeps talking about

marriage. And I don't really want

to get married -- not now anyway.

TOBY

That's fine with me.

(a beat; new tone)

I wish you would've stayed married

to Dad.

CAROLINE

Oh, don't wish Duke back on me.

God.

TOBY

That woman he married?    Is she

really rich?

CAROLINE

Like King Midas. Okay, look,

we'll go back to Seattle and see

how things go. I've been thinking

about taking a course in

stenotyping. A court reporter's

pay is real high. Kathy got

engaged, so either I find us

another roommate or I've got to

make some more money. And this

stenotyping thing sounds just

right. This could turn out good,

honey.

TERRY TAYLOR

Wolff, you are so full of shit.

TOBY

Don't believe me -- see if I care.

All a .22 bullet would do is make

a hole in his head.

That's one obscene word.

Look, Mrs. Wolff, Jack's teachers,

like him but they think he's fallen

in with the wrong kind of friends.

(peers at Toby's

hand)

Is that nicotine stain on your

fingers?

(as Toby shakes his

head "no")

I hope not. Let me tell you a

story: I started smoking in

college. Two packs a day. I ate

'em.

(a beat)

One night I went to have a

cigarette and lo and behold, the

pack was empty. I went downstairs

and started to rummage through the

garbage cans. But as I reached

down -- I mean, right down into a

garbage can -- I suddenly thought,

'Whoa. Hold on right there,

Buster.' I went back to my room

and to this day I haven't smoked

another cigarette.

After that, every day I saved the

exact amount of money I would've

spent on cigarettes. In three

years, I put it all together, and

you know what I bought? I bought

myself...

... a Nash Ambassador.

Caroline gives a bark of laughter. She brings out a

handkerchief and coughs, as if she has a cold. Mr.

Shippy looks puzzled.

Late afternoon sun slants through the venetian blinds.

Toby sits exactly as he sat before. Then Caroline comes

out of the bedroom, ominously calm. She sits down.

CAROLINE

So what shall we do?

TOBY

What do you mean?

CAROLINE

Ever since Duke and I got divorced,

you're a different boy. I know

he never calls you and I could

kill him for it -- but that's how

Duke is. And Gregory's in

Princeton now, so I guess...

Yes, you do. You steal from

So, you tell me what to do.

TOBY

I can be better. I will be.

him)

And I hate the way I am anymore!

I don't know why I do it!

What about that stenotyping

thing you were gonna do?

With peculiar intensity, Caroline speaks in a soft,

odd voice:

CAROLINE

It won't happen. It won't happen.

It won't happen. Things aren't

going to turn out well, things

aren't going to start looking up,

and it's never going to be like

heaven on a June day. There is

no uranium. There is no

stenotyping. There is no C.P.A.

license. There isn't...

She stands for a few moments as if listening for a

far-off sound.

CAROLINE

... I talked to Dwight: after

Christmas, he wants you to come

up to Concrete and live with him

for a few months -- go to school

there.

TOBY

What are you going to do, just

give me away to him?

tree with bubble-lights glows in a corner.

Caroline shuts a suitcase and looks at Toby.

Okay.    I will.

face. You want me to do that?

TOBY

No.

DWIGHT

Then you must be the one's a liar,

right?

(as Toby nods)

And you're a performer?

TOBY

I guess.

DWIGHT

You guess? You guess? Let's see

your act. Go on. Do your act.

(when Toby is silent)

I'm waiting.

TOBY

I can't.

TOBY

No, sir.

DWIGHT

Do me.     I hear you do me.

DWIGHT

Yeah, I hear you're good at doing

me. Here. Do me with the lighter.

Go on. Take it.

DWIGHT

Hotshot. You pull that hotshot

stuff around me and I'll break

every bone in your body. You

understand me?

You're in for a change, mister.

You got that? Huh? You got that

You're in for a whole 'nother

I know you think you're better

than me. Caroline told me all

about your rich daddy and your

prep-school brother, but your

fancy days are over: you're a

Concrete boy now. I'm gonna give

you a big injection of Concrete.

That's right -- inoculate you.

Oh, my, yes. You're gonna find

out that in Concrete we have to

be able to do more than sing Fats

Domino songs, we work...

NORMA

You'll be in Miss Graham's class?

TOBY

Yeah, is she nice?

NORMA

She's okay.   She's pretty.

TOBY

I hate changing schools.

DWIGHT

Speaking of changing, I had a talk

with Jack on the way up here, and

he says he wants to be a better

boy. And that's good, 'cause

things weren't going well for him

in Seattle: the police actually

came to his house to talk to

Caroline about him. Uh-huh, the

police.

PEARL

Criminal.

DWIGHT

So here's what I think: I think

idle hands are the devil's

workshop, and so I found our Jack

a little something to do.

(to Toby)

I picked up two barrels of horse-

chestnuts in the park. You can

spend your evenings hulling 'em.

And I enrolled you in the Boy

Scouts, and you've got a paper

route, starting Monday, every

afternoon from three to six-thirty

-- pays fifty-five bucks a month.

What d'you say?

TOBY

I'll do it.

(means it)

I want to be... better.

DWIGHT

That's what I like to hear. Okay,

you guys get these dishes cleaned

up. Let's show Jack how we do it

in Concrete.

'Of course I prayed -- and did God

care? He cared as much as on the

air a bird had stamped her foot

is the tone of this short poem?

Is it religious?

MISS GRAHAM

No -- even though it talks about

God, I wouldn't say it was

religious.

It's sad.

crap, you know? I believe there

is such a thing as a bad boy --

bad clear through. And it's gonna

be my job to turn you around, to

kill or cure. Kill. Or. Cure.

Understand? And I'm up to the

job, oh yes, believe me, hotshot,

I am ready, willing and able to

take you on -- you and that

jibagoo music you like to sing.

I'm just the guy to knock that

music out of your head and put in

some respect and obedience.

(a pause)

Now your mother has just about

washed her hands of you -- that's

obvious, 'cause she's shipped you

off up here. I mean, she has had

it with you. She told me: she

said 'Dwight, I just can't handle

him anymore.' So don't go crying

to Mama, 'cause Mama won't listen.

Mama is sick to death of her baby

And your rich Daddy Warbucks and

your Princeton brother don't give

told me they haven't even written

in over two years. So it looks

like I'm all you got now -- it's

just you and me. Feels sort of

inevitable, doesn't it, hotshot?

It's like we were fated for each

other, like I'm the one guy on

Earth could set you straight.

And don't you ever think I won't

enjoy doing it, 'cause...

with papers slung over one shoulder which thuds

against his hip with every step making him tilt

to one side against the weight.

55   B)   (NIGHT) Toby   sits in a utility porch. The floor     55

around him is  two feet deep in horse chestnuts. With

a knife and a  pair of pliers he husks the chestnuts.

His hands are  covered with scrapes and cuts and the

chestnut hulls  bleed a juice that has dyed them a

bright yellow.

CAROLINE (V.O.)

Dear Toby, I sure do miss you,

honey -- the house is like a tomb

since you left. So quiet. My

only entertainment tonight was

watching Marian eat a whole pint

of ice cream. I hope you're

liking it up in Concrete. I just

know you'll try hard in school and

be good and mind Dwight. I worry

about you so much, and I hope this

will be just what you need.

55   C)   (DAY)   Toby rubs futilely at his yellow hands with      55

He sees Arthur Gayle coming toward him in the

tilts to one side. As he and Toby pass  one another,

he raises one arm and points at Toby.  The he walks

on.

TOBY (V.O.)

Dear Mom, Thanks for the birthday

present. It fit fine. You don't

have to worry so much. I'm okay

here. The weather is nice, and I

like Scouts a lot. Dwight took us

all to see Bridge on the River

Kwai. I liked it. So things are

all right with me, except for

stupid Pearl, who I hate. Don't

worry all the time...

55   E)   (NIGHT) Dwight introduces Toby at a Scout              55

uniforms.

55   F)   (DAY) Toby is on the utility porch  husking the 55

horse chestnuts. His hands are now  orange. Pearl

stands in the doorway watching him work. Norma

appears beside Pearl. Norma's face  turns

sympathetic.

NORMA

You remind me of that boy in the

fairy tale who had to spend twenty

years sifting sand to find a

golden needle. Remember that one?

Toby doesn't answer. The two girls move away.    Toby

sighs, and picks up another chestnut.

55   G)   (DAY) Toby, keeping an eye on the door to make 55

sure he's unobserved, reaches under the mattress

of Skipper's bed and pulls out several billfold-sized

black and white pornographic photographs. The hair

styles of the women in them are decades old.

Toby takes the photographs into the bathroom,

shutting the door behind him.

CAROLINE (V.O.)

Dear Toby, Just a note before

going to bed. Dwight tells me

that the two of you are getting

along like a house afire. I'm

so glad. I wanted this to work

out for you. You left your sock

cap here. Do you need it...?

He's miserable.

this morning, so I drove up to

This's private property, in case

you're interested.

(normal voice)

I turned around and there was this

Yechh! Ugliest woman I ever saw

Oh, Daddy!

Boy's Life?

DWIGHT

It's the official Scout magazine.

Tells about what it means to be a

Scout, what kind of boy you need

to be, and, oh, about merit badges

and stuff like that.

TOBY

'Suggested good turns a Scout can

do: assist a foreign  boy with

some English grammar.  Help put

out a burning field.  Give water

to a crippled dog.'  I could do

those.

TOBY

What's his name again?

OSCAR

Arthur Gayle.

JIMMY

What a homo.

TOBY

He sure walks like a girl.

JIMMY

And runs like one and talks like

one and throws like one. Probably

takes a pee like one too -- just

squats right down.

TOBY

He smarted off to me the other

day -- told me I was a bourgeois.

JIMMY

What the frig's a bourgeois?

(CONTINUED)

71   CONTINUED:                                          71

OSCAR

(to Toby)

Call him a sissy.

TOBY

Why?

OSCAR

Just see what he says.

JIMMY

Yeah, do it.

ARTHUR

Oh, my, my -- look at all that

yellow: Didn't your mama teach you

to wash your hands after you pee?

TOBY

Oh, shut up.

ARTHUR

(rolls his eyes;

heavily sarcastic)

Now that's what I like -- an

insult with some originality.

Did you just make that up? Just

now? So clever.

TOBY

Why don't you take a long walk

off a short pier?

ARTHUR

(though he's not

nearly close enough

to smell Toby's

breath)

Excuse me, but has anyone ever told

you your breath would gag a maggot?

TOBY

Well, at least I'm not a great

big sissy!

ARTHUR

GET UP! GET UP, YOU SON OF A

BITCHING MAGGOT GAGGER! I'LL

STOMP YOUR GUTS OUT! I'LL KILL

YOU!

ARTHUR

Take it back.

ARTHUR

Take it back.

TOBY

Okay.

ARTHUR

Say it.

TOBY

Okay.   I take it back.

ARTHUR

No, say 'You're not a sissy.'

TOBY

You're not a sissy.

72   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON         72

CAROLINE

I won't do it, you know. I won't

be a referee between the two of

you.

TOBY

Who asked you?

CAROLINE

You both do. You do. Just by

coming home like this you ask me

to take your side when he raises

hell.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)

Well, the answer's 'No.' I'm going

to make this marriage work. No

fights.

TOBY

Oh, the bride is calm.   Who the

hell cares?

CAROLINE

(to herself)

... seems like this place is so

ugly. Seems like everywhere I

look there's something... ugly.

73   INT. SKIPPER AND TOBY'S ROOM - EVENING                       73

DWIGHT

Who won?

TOBY

(surprised)

Uh, well, uh... he's the one can't

see out of one eye.

DWIGHT

Hot damn! You actually gave

little Lord Gayle a black eye?

TOBY

Well, it wasn't black yet.

DWIGHT

But it was all puffed up?

(as Toby nods)

Then it was a shiner.

(CONTINUED)

67.

73   CONTINUED:                                              73

DWIGHT

How'd it start?

TOBY

I called him a sissy.

DWIGHT

Well, he sure's hell can't sue you

for slander. That boy fights for

the pink team. Did you make him

cry?

TOBY

Well... he was just ready to. I

called him a big-assed, squat-

to-pee sissy.

(as Dwight slaps his

leg again)

I'd have won bigger except he hit

me when I wasn't looking.

DWIGHT

(suddenly serious)

He dry-gulched you. Now that's

your fault. You gotta keep your

guard up. There's no excuse for

getting dry-gulched. I'll show

you a couple moves after supper

that'll leave Miss Arthur Gayle

wondering what month it is.

74   INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING                                    74

DWIGHT

... so he says, 'You and who

else's army?' 'Just the three of

us,' I say. 'Me, myself and I.'

(a beat)

Well, after school he's waiting

for me and he yells something -- I

tell you, with people like that,

you got to hurt 'em, gotta inflict

pain, or they'll never leave you

alone.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)

(a beat)

So it was real hot out, okay? And

there were these horse turds laying

all over the place. I picked one up

and went up to him, but not acting

tough, okay? Acting more like, 'Oh

gee, I'm so scared, please don't

hurt me.' Sort of like this:

DWIGHT

So I say, 'Excuse me, but what's

the problem?' And he starts in on

me again, blah, blah, blah, and I

jam a horse turd right into that

big mouth. Then I give him a

sucker punch in the breadbasket,

and he goes down like a...

75   EXT. UTILITY PORCH - NIGHT                                   75

DWIGHT

No, no. From the shoulder.

Straight.

(demonstrates)

Like this. This. Otherwise you

leave yourself wide open.

(as Toby tries)

Yeah, better, better... and keep

those feet moving, shuffle,

shuffle, that's right... now try

for my face... good...

CAROLINE

... not good, to tell you the

truth not good at all.

(listens)

No, he's not mean to me...

(listens again)

No, he's good about that: comes

home right after work every night.

(listens again)

Oh, Marian, I don't know -- maybe

I just got my hopes too high,

although I don't think so. All I

want is a little...

(searches)

... a little son-of-a-bitching

sweetness. That's all.

(listens; laughs)

You think so, huh? You always did

have an eye for Dwight, didn't

you?

(leans back; watches

Dwight and Toby)

The thing is, he's out on the

porch teaching Jack to box right

now. I keep thinking if I can

hang on, things'll settle down.

If I can just hang on long enough,

it'll work out and my kid'll have

a father. You know?

77   EXT. UTILITY PORCH - LATER                                    77

TOBY

You said you'd show me how to

dry-gulch somebody.

DWIGHT

Okay. Now you can always  kick

somebody in the balls, but I like

this one better: What you  do is

hit 'em in the throat with the

side of your forearm. You  wait

'til -- hah!

(CONTINUED)

77   CONTINUED:                                              77

DWIGHT

Now that's dry-gulching. Hit 'em

in the throat, but do it before

they're expecting it. Now you try.

TOBY

I'm afraid I'll hurt you.

DWIGHT

You won't.

TOBY

But I might.

DWIGHT

Come onnn.   You're not trying.

DWIGHT

Well, don't go all shy and delicate

on me -- you're as sissy as little

Miss Arthur Gayle. Yeah -- I'll just

call you 'Little Miss Jackie Wolff.'

Ooh, my, yes -- Hello, Jackie.

DWIGHT

Aw, Jesus Christ, if you're gonna --

TOBY

You just about got dry-gulched, my

man.

CAROLINE

I know you may think this is

silly, Dwight, but it seems

like... I don't know, like an

emblem or something. I want to

be able to see your face when we

make love. How else can we be

cl --

The rest of the word is jerked out of her as Dwight turns

her onto her side, away from him, and proceeds to make

love again in his favorite manner.

DWIGHT

You just don't know what's good,

Sugar. You're too tense. You

just relax and Dwight'll take you

on a little trip. Okay? You'll

have a good time.

Caroline closes her eyes.

78A   SAME SCENE - HOURS LATER                            78A

Dwight leans back against the headboard of the bed.

Caroline sits between his legs, her back against his

chest. With one hand, Dwight strokes Caroline's hair.

The other hand is curled around her throat.

DWIGHT

... are the prettiest thing I've

ever seen. I mean it. You are.

The way your hair curls up right

there. So pretty. I just love

you so much. I don't know what

I'd do if you ever left me. I

couldn't take it.

(smiles)

Guy I knew in the Navy had a

saying: 'If you love her, here's

what to do: Let her go visit

places new. If she loves you,

she'll come back to you.   If

she don't come back... hunt the

bitch down and kill her.'

(laughs)

That's awful, I guess. I don't

feel that way, but close. My

pretty thing...

We see that Caroline realizes the enormity of her

mistake.

TOBY

... but ask him again, why don't

you? I hate it so much.

CAROLINE

(never stops sewing)

I asked him a week ago, I asked

him this morning -- he wants you

to keep the paper route.

TOBY

Then make him give me the money.

It's mine, I earned it. It's

$220.00 already.

CAROLINE

He won't. He says he'll keep it

for when you really need it.

TOBY

That's not fair. I ought to be

able to have my own money.

(as Caroline shrugs)

But it's mine.

82   CONTINUED:                                              82

CAROLINE

You remind me of a baby bird --

you know those frantic little

things with their mouths wide

open, wanting, wanting.

TOBY

Well, at least ask him about my

gym shoes again. I can practice

barefoot but for games I gotta

have shoes.

CAROLINE

I'm not a referee. I won't do

it.

TOBY

Oh, we know, we know: the bride

won't argue. The bride won't

raise her voice.

CAROLINE

Well, I'll tell you what    the bride

will do: the bride will     get up

and walk over there and    slap hell

out of the bride's son.     Now does

the bride's son want his    face

slapped?

TOBY

Oh, I hate it here! I wish we

could just get up and go.

CAROLINE

I don't have another 'get up and

go' left in me! You understand?

I'm telling you I've hit a god-

damn wall. I can't run anymore.

Now this whole thing isn't perfect

for me, either... let me impress

that on you real strong, okay? I

don't wake up singing every morning.

But I'm going to make this marriage

work -- I won't join in any fights,

you got that? I won't even raise

my voice!

CAROLINE

See those two roses? He picked

them for me on his way home last

night.

Big deal.

CAROLINE

I'm trying to concentrate on the

good stuff.

NORMA

What d'ya think? I think I look

like a fool.

Who cares? Six weeks to graduation,

TOBY

I'm telling you I didn't.

DWIGHT

And I know damn well you did.

TOBY

Well, you're wrong.

DWIGHT

About some things, yeah. Not

about this. You're a goddam hog,

and I proved it.

TOBY

How do you know Skipper didn't eat

it? Or Norma? Or Pearl?

DWIGHT

I told all three of them to stay

away from this candy for twenty-

four hours.

TOBY

Well, how do you know I even ate

any?

DWIGHT

(a triumphant smile)

I counted them. You hogged down

eleven chocolate covered cherries

since yesterday afternoon.

So what?

DWIGHT

So that makes you a hog. I just

wanted to establish that fact, and

now I have.

DWIGHT

(to Caroline and

Skipper)

Hey. Mr. Hotshot Hog and I've

just been establishing some facts,

and what we come up with is this:

One, he's a pig who gobbles down

everybody's candy; two, he lies

about it; three, he lays around

on his lazy ass day and night

reading, reading; and four, he's

not getting any ten-dollar gym

shoes. That's about what we've

come up with so far.

SKIPPER

Oh, Dad...

DWIGHT

(a high, mincing

voice)

Oh, Dad!

TOBY

(to Caroline)

Why don't you ever take up for me?

DWIGHT

(to Caroline)

Why don't you ever help me

straighten that boy out?

All he does is read or listen to

records or sing.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)

(he sings five seconds

of a grotesque

"Blue Monday")

I'm so sick of that shit! And

when he isn't singing, he's

watching T.V.

(to Toby)

And don't say you don't 'cause

when I come home I always put my

hand on top of it to see if it's

warm, and it always is. This is

the news, kid -- I'm wise to you.

TOBY

Oh, big, big deal, who cares, and

as long as we're passing out news

here, I don't want to do my paper

route anymore.

DWIGHT

I bet you don't -- big lazy candy

hog like you'd rather lay on his

ass and read, wouldn't you?

Let me tell you something: you're

gonna deliver those papers if I

have to walk behind you with a

horsewhip ever' step of the way.

TOBY

Then give me the money I earn!

DWIGHT

Hell, no. I'm putting that in the

bank for you for when you really

need it -- cuss me now, thank me

later.

TOBY

Mom,  won't you at least make him

let  me have the shoes for gym?

How  can I play basketball without

gym  shoes? I'm the only one who --

TOBY

It's not the shoes, is it? Or the

candy. It's me, isn't it? You

just can't stand the fact of me.

DWIGHT

I, well, no, it's not that -- I

just want you to be well-behaved.

Your rich daddy 'Duke' doesn't

care anything about you, and so

somebody's got to train you, and

one of the things you've gotta be

trained about is not to be a hog

and eat everybody's candy like a --

CAROLINE

Oh.

CAROLINE

Oh.

just go on to Scouts and let her

rest?

You lay down and rest awhile.

Father and son photographs are being taken. Dwight is

the only father who wears a complete uniform and cap.

When Dwight and Toby's turn comes, Dwight puts on a big

smile and throws an arm around Toby's shoulder.

DWIGHT

Check for the tongue tonight --

you forgot it last week.

Otherwise you won't get your

life-saving badge.

85A   SAME SCENE - LATER                                          85A

Six boys are lying on the floor pretending unconscious-

ness. Six other boys, Toby among them, are going through

several life-saving steps such as turning the bodies

over, checking for pulses, etc.

The BOY on whom Toby is working is a heavy, pimple-faced

lout.

Toby checks if the Boy's breathing is obstructed.

Gingerly, he tugs on the Boy's chin, starting to open the

Boy's mouth.

Suddenly the Boy opens his mouth wide, exposing a half-

chewed mass of cheese n' crackers. Toby gives the lout

a knee in the ribs.

TOBY

Bastard.   Swallow that.

BOY

(laughing)

Give my pud a big squeeze while

you're at it, why don't you?

Toby and the life-savers on either side of him laugh a

bit.

As Toby kneels down to tie his shoelace, a small black

dog runs up to him. Toby pets it. Arthur Gayle, his

black eye healed, stands ten feet away.

You like my dog?

Yeah, he's nice.

Sure -- I just about believe you.

ARTHUR

Hey, Pepper -- what's on a tree?

ARTHUR

Bark! Way to go, Pepper -- pretty

smart. Oh, I was wondering,

Pepper -- I wanted to ask you

something: how's the world

treating you?

ARTHUR

Rough!   Yeah, I know what you

mean.

TOBY

That's dumb. A little funny,

though. How come your dad never

comes to meetings with you?

ARTHUR

I don't have a dad. Never did. I

sprang full-blown from my mother's

forehead. You want to walk home

with me and Pepper?

TOBY

Sure -- compared to a ride home

with Dwight, it'll be like heaven

on a June day.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

My real parents would probably have

given me an elegant name, too.

I say 'real parents' because I

suspect I'm a foundling. Somebody

royal -- or at least very, very

beautiful had me and gave me to

my poor but honest mother.

(a beat)

Tell me more about you.

TOBY

(shrugs)

Every day of my life feels like

a mile on the Bataan Death March.

ARTHUR

(laughs)

I knew I'd like you.

TOBY

Why'd you point at me that day?

ARTHUR

Because you're an alien. You don't

belong in Concrete any more than I

do. This place would like to kill

us because we're different.

TOBY

Oh, come on, Arthur.   That's a

little dramatic.

ARTHUR

Think so? You know what chickens

do if one chicken's born with a

little difference? With a few

black feathers on its head, say?

They peck at the black spot 'til

the chicken's dead -- they can't

stand the fact that it's

different. Now we're both

different. Your difference is

something other than...

(husky-voiced

actress)

... my difference...

(normal tone)

But we're both aliens here.

TOBY

I don't exactly feel like an

alien. I've got friends here.

Yes, and they're fools. And you

act like a fool when you're around

them. A prediction: if you stay

in Concrete, you'll wind up working

at the A&P -- either that or you'll

go on a rampage with a hunting rifle.

TOBY

Yeah, and you'll wind up a recluse

that everybody says likes to dress

up in his mama's old clothes.

ARTHUR

Maybe, maybe, but no matter how

many times I have to repeat: my

primary goal's to get out of

Concrete.

The hell you aren't. You can just

make your own deals from now on.

CAROLINE

What's wrong?

TOBY

Dwight traded my rifle for a dog.

He says the dog's for me, but it's

some stupid dog he wanted.

CAROLINE

All right.    Okay, Dwight. You

stay here.    Don't come inside.

CAROLINE

(calm)

Get his rifle back.

DWIGHT

But that dog's a champion!

CAROLINE

Get his rifle back.

DWIGHT

Am I supposed to go clear to

Seattle just to get...

CAROLINE

Get his rifle back.

DWIGHT

Jesus Christ, woman, I don't even

know the guy's last name.

DWIGHT

All right, all right. The guy's

supposed to send the A.K.C. papers.

When he sends 'em, I'll know his

name and address, and I'll go get

the god-damn rifle back. Jesus.

96   EXT. HOUSE - EVENING                                          96

CAROLINE

Well, I did it -- and the bride

didn't even raise her voice: he

says he'll get the rifle back as

soon as the guy who sold him the

dog sends the papers.

(CONTINUED)

96   CONTINUED:                                              96

CAROLINE

'Course, having seen that dog, I

wouldn't suggest you hang by your

thumbs 'til those papers come. I

mean, that dog is ugly.

CAROLINE

That's nice -- I haven't seen a

real smile out of you in a month.

TOBY

Oh, Mom, can't we leave here? I

hate it so much. You don't like

it either -- all you do is stick

your head in a sewing machine

night and day. Let's just leave

and start over someplace else.

CAROLINE

'Start over.' Do you know how

many times I've started over,

sweetheart? I don't want to do

it anymore. This is as far as I

want to go. This place. I have

to make this work somehow. We do.

You're fourteen now -- you have

to help me.

TOBY

But if...

CAROLINE

But me no buts, honey. I told

you: I've hit a wall. And

besides, it's not so bad here,

if you just try to --

TOBY

If you say 'look for the good

stuff,' I'm gonna get Dwight's

30/30 and shoot myself!

CAROLINE

Seriously, though: give the place

a chance. Give him a chance.

TOBY

Great. Just great. What a life:

I gotta live with Dwight... I got

a sissy for a new best friend...

You got a dog.

DWIGHT (O.S.)

Heh Hotshot!

DWIGHT

If you can tear yourself away from

your pedicure, I want you to fetch

me some of that paint from the

attic.

TOBY

Yeah.

DWIGHT

Is now too soon.

TOBY

God!

99    INT. DWIGHT'S ATTIC                                           99

Dwight and Toby are looking for something. They both

shine flashlights around the dark attic, illuminating

old magazines, dolls, etc. Dwight says, "I know I put

'em up here somewhere." Then Toby's flashlight lands

on the unusual tub with the four blue stars which had

held the beaver. Forgotten all this time, the beaver

has transmogrified into a weird, two-foot high pile of

what looks like cotton candy. And, hideously enough,

the cloud-like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver.

Then Dwight says, "Shit -- the roof must've leaked on

'em." Toby turns to where Dwight shines his flashlight

on the ten boxes of chestnuts.

Also forgotten, the chestnuts are    covered with mold,

too -- but a different kind: this     is wet, slick-looking

stuff that rises off the chestnuts    like dough in a

breadpan. A spasm of rage crosses     Toby's face, and he

turns and bangs out of the attic.

100   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)        100

A drink in one hand, idly fondling Champ's ears with the

other, Dwight is watching the NEWS.

On the TELEVISION we see a distraught Lana Turner   and

her daughter, Cheryl Crane, as the teenaged girl   is

led into a tall building.  While we see this, and   then

a photograph of a stockily handsome Italian man,   we hear:

NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

... Cheryl Crane, daughter of Lana

Turner, was held for questioning

today in the stabbing death of

Johnny Stompanato, Miss Turner's

companion. A spokesman for Miss

Turner said today that the

stabbing was an accident, and that

Miss Turner's daughter will not

spend even one night in jail for

what the spokesman called a

'tragic accident.'

Suddenly aware of another presence in   the room, Dwight

turns and sees Toby, who is standing   in the doorway,

also listening to the NEWSCAST. Toby    is not watching

the television, though, he is staring   fixedly at

Dwight.

Dwight reacts then glances back at the set, where the

Stompanato murder story continues. He turns slowly back

to Toby, whose eyes are still locked onto his face. The

SOUND on the TV FADES.

89.

101   INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                                     101

A WHISTLE FADES UP.

Toby's basketball game against the Van Horn team is

starting. Alone among all the other players, Toby wears

his street shoes. Heavy squarish brogans, they CLOMP,

and THUD as Toby runs up and down the court.

The leather soles slip like skates on the highly-polished

floor, and Toby falls repeatedly. At first the crowd is

silent, collectively embarrassed at the boy wearing these

strange shoes. Then Toby takes a particularly hard fall,

and somebody laughs. The crowd in general takes it up,

and soon there is GENERAL LAUGHTER whenever Toby's shoes

SQUEAL particularly loudly, or whenever the shoes trip

him up or cause another boy to stumble.

Soon one WOMAN'S HIGH-PITCHED LAUGH DOMINATES the

gymnasium. The laugh is hideous, shrill and mindless,

like some ringer planted in the audience of a situation

comedy.

Toby sees Norma necking with some guy and is horrified.

Toby slips and slides, falls and rises. All the while

his expression is hard as stone: he will get through

this or die. And, like a mantra, he mutters one phrase

over and over: "gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get

out, gotta get out." Finally he makes a basket. One

VOICE from the audience YELLS out "Okay, kid -- way

to go!" and then two or three people APPLAUD. Instants

later, Toby catches a rebound and makes another basket.

The fickle crowd decides to love an underdog and APPLAUDS

heartily for the boy in the funny shoes. But Toby's

expression never changes.

102   INT. DWIGHT'S GARAGE - SAME NIGHT (VERY LATE)              102

The Buick, rolls silently down the driveway pushed by a

straining but cautious Toby. Champ runs into the street,

Toby tries to shoo him away. The DOG BARKS ONCE, and

Toby quickly opens the car door and lets him in, STARTING

the ENGINE.

103   INT. BUICK - LATE NIGHT                              103

Toby drives fast leaving Concrete behind. He turns the

RADIO ON, and a VOICE bawls out "Oh, Maybelline," Toby

turns the VOLUME UP, turns it UP AGAIN, so that the MUSIC

is DISTORTED. Toby begins to accelerate. The needle

creeps past ninety, and hovers close to one hundred.

(CONTINUED)

90.

103    CONTINUED:                                            103

Trees flash past in the headlights, occasional cars are

overtaken and passed in an instant. Toby starts laughing

hysterically and sings loudly along with the THROBBING

MUSIC.

The Buick begins to shudder and wobble -- Toby hits the

brakes but the Buick spins and goes sideways into the

ditch. SILENCE.

104    EXT. BUICK - LATE NIGHT                                     104

The car is caught so that two of the wheels are off the

ground, and can get no purchase. Toby starts walking

back toward Concrete.

105    EXT. ROAD - LATE NIGHT                                      105

Toby and Champ have been walking a long time.   A truck

comes from behind Toby, pulls over.

DRIVER

That your car in the ditch back

there?

(as Toby nods)

How'd you do that, anyway?

TOBY

It's hard to explain.

DRIVER

Get in.

106    EXT. BUICK - VERY LATE NIGHT                                106

The man is winching the Buick out of the ditch.

107    EXT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - DAWN                     107

Toby silently closes the garage door, the Buick

inside and heads for the house.

107A   SKIPPER AND TOBY'S ROOM - NOON                              107A

The clock shows noon. Toby is in bed reading Boy's Life,

holding a sandwich and trying to stay awake. Suddenly

Dwight appears. Dwight puts his hands into his pockets,

leans against the doorway.

(CONTINUED)

91.

107A   CONTINUED:                                                  107A

DWIGHT

Your mother said you were sick.

Feeling better?

TOBY

Yeah, I am.

DWIGHT

Good, good.    Get some sleep, did

you?

TOBY

Yeah, I slept about four hours.

DWIGHT

Must've needed it.

A pause:

DWIGHT

Oh, by the way, you didn't happen

to hear a funny pinging noise in

the engine, did you?

TOBY

What engine?

DWIGHT

I was downtown with Champ a few

minutes ago, and I met a guy who

recognized him. Said he'd seen

my dog this very morning. Told me

an interesting story of how he and

the dog happened to meet. What

d'you think about that?

TOBY

I don't know what you --

Suddenly Dwight is across the floor and onto the bed.

He straddles Toby and slaps him across the face with the

left hand then the right, again and again.

Toby holds a forearm protectively across his face.

Dwight holds both Toby's hands with one of his and, slaps

the boy's face again and again.

Finally Toby manages to get his right hand loose.      He

slams his forearm across Dwight's throat.

Dwight rears back, choking and gagging. Toby throws off

the covers and tries to run. Still choking, Dwight

grabs the back of Toby's hair and forces the boy's face

down against the mattress.

(CONTINUED)

92.

107A   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              107A

Then he doubles up his fist and slams it into the back

of Toby's neck. Toby goes rigid with pain. Dwight

stumbles up gasping for breath.

DWIGHT

Only me. On this whole earth, to

straighten you out. And I will do

it kill or cure. Now get your ass

up -- you're going to school.

108    EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - NOON                                        108

A BELL RINGS as Dwight's BUICK SCREECHES to a stop and

Toby gets out. As he heads toward the doors. Toby then

turns to stare at Dwight's car. They lock eyes, then

Dwight smirks and pulls away. Toby watches the car

disappear, then spins around and walks into the school.

FADE OUT.

FADE UP TO:

108A   SAME SCENE - AFTERNOON                                         108A

The CAMERA is in the EXACT SAME SPOT.

The school seems a bit seedier, and two newly-planted

saplings established in the previous scene are both eight

feet taller, with wide spreading branches.

Students pour out    the door. Among them Toby, taller and

a bit heavier, he    now wears black leather boots, and a

pack of cigarettes    rolled into the sleeve of his T-shirt.

His hair is still    pure Elvis.

Toby comes back out the door with four very different

friends. CHUCK BOLGER, the most reasonable-looking of

Toby's companions, is the son of a minister. A second

boy, known as PSYCHO, is a hulking boy with a tendency

toward sadism. JERRY HUFF is handsome in a pouty, heavy-

lidded way. His Elvis pompadour is even higher than

Toby's. ARCH COOK is an amiable simpleton who sometimes

talks to himself or laughs for no reason.

Toby and his four friends pile into Chuck Bolger's '53

CHEVY, and they PEEL OUT.

109    INT. CHUCK BOLGER'S CAR - NOON                                 109

As the car barrels through downtown Concrete, we see a

movie marquee reading...

109   CONTINUED:                                              109

... The Apartment, and a five foot poster that says,

"ELECT JOHN KENNEDY, 1960."

In the back seat, Psycho pours vodka into a half empty

can of Hawaiian punch, then takes a huge swig.

PSYCHO

(screams it)

Ag-Hhh! Gorilla blood.

JERRY

Oh, Psycho, shut up.

CHUCK

(pointing)

Oh, look -- there goes Carol

Baumgarten. Ain't she sweet?

She's hot for Wolff.

TOBY

I wish.

CHUCK

Won't do her any good, though --

Jack's saving himself for Rhea

Clark.

TOBY

Knock it off.

JERRY

You know what he said about Rhea?

Said even the inside of her arm

turned him on. You slay me,

Wolff. She is pretty though.

ARCH

(after a pause;

wistful)

I'd sure like to eat Rhea Clark's

pussy.

There is general laughter, mixed with groans.

JERRY         PSYCHO CHUCK

God, here we        Eatin' pussy        Jesus, give it

go again.           is all that         a rest, Arch.

man knows.

ARCH

No, I   mean it. I'd like to get

down   and really grovel on it.

Spend   about a week with my face

right   in it.

(CONTINUED)

94.

109   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              109

There is a pause while all the boys dwell on this thought.

It sounds good to them.

PSYCHO

Aghhh, pussy!

110   EXT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON             110

Chuck Bolger's CAR SCREECHES to a halt, and Toby exits,

followed by an empty Hawaiian Punch can which someone

tosses after him. Toby gives a wave, starts toward the

house, and the CAR LAYS RUBBER, while OVER that we hear

Psycho SCREAMING, "AGH-H-H!"

111   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON           111

Pearl is setting the table and singing the Everly

Brothers hit, "Bye, Bye, Love." The passage of two years

has improved Pearl. Her bald spot has grown back in, and

she has learned to fix her hair and use makeup. She smiles

and nods to Toby, never stopping her singing for a moment.

Toby stands next to her and sings harmony for a few notes.

It is clear that their relationship has improved. Toby

stops singing.

TOBY

Where's Mom?

Still singing, Pearl points to the living room.

112   INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING                              112

Caroline is watching a newscast of John Kennedy and Harry

Truman at a press conference outside Truman's Missouri

office. She hears Toby, turns to him.

We see that the last two years have marked her. She's

changed. Her expression is fixed, almost as if she were

wearing a mask. Even the words are cheerful, but some of

the old optimism is gone.

CAROLINE

Oh, honey, good news -- Truman's

going to campaign for him.

(lowers her voice)

I gave twenty-five dollars to his

campaign office today. I've been

thinking I'd like to work...

She is interrupted by Dwight's voice O.S.

(CONTINUED)

95.

112   CONTINUED:                                              112

DWIGHT (O.S.)

Here I am, you lucky people!

Toby and Caroline exchange a glance.     It speaks volumes.

113   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                          113

Dwight, Caroline, Toby and Pearl sit at the table, eat-

ing. Champ sits by Dwight's chair -- obviously his dog.

Dwight seems unchanged by the two years.

Just now, Dwight is in the middle of telling another of

his "Dwight Is The Best" stories. From the bored faces

around the table, this is another in a long series.

DWIGHT

... So the S.O.B. had been on my

back for a week at work, okay?

Sayin' I stole his wrench, an'

poured oil all over his tools, as

if! Anyway, he went just one step

too far with old Dwight, okay?

Spat on the floor as I walked by.

I turned around and walked back

to him, acting so dainty and

humble and scared, you know, all

innocent -- and the minute he took

his eyes off me, BLAM, I dry

gulched him! I shut his water off

good! Never gave me another

second's grief to this very day.

There is a pause.   One more story.   Nobody has much of a

reaction.

CAROLINE

I heard Kennedy on the news again

tonight -- I don't know: I hate

the Democrats and the Republicans,

but then once in a while somebody

comes along who doesn't seem

like...

(she searches)

... a liar.

DWIGHT

Kennedy -- the senator from Rome.

CAROLINE

He gives me hope.

DWIGHT

I know what he gives you, and it

sure as hell isn't hope.

(CONTINUED)

96.

113   CONTINUED:                                            113

CAROLINE

(laughs)

It's true he is attractive! And

it may just be those white teeth

that I respond to. But I don't

think so.

(a beat)

I'm going to work for his campaign.

DWIGHT

No. Too many Republicans   in this

town. They hear my wife's   working

for the Democrats, they'll  take

their cars someplace else  to be

fixed. Bad idea. No.

There is a brief silence. Suddenly Caroline leans across

the table and speaks to Dwight in a loud, exaggerated

disappointed whine:

CAROLINE

Oh, Rickyyy!

(louder; same whine)

Oh, Ricky-y-y! Please let me

come down and work at the club!

DWIGHT

What the hell are you doing?

CAROLINE

Well, you treat me like Lucy,

I'll act like her. I'll be

working for Kennedy's campaign.

114   INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME NIGHT (LATER)                       114

The four of them are watching "The Untouchables." We

watch as a frightened man speaks to Al Capone, who sits

behind a large desk.

FRIGHTENED MAN (V.O.)

(on T.V.)

... please, Mr. Capone, it'll never

happen again, I swear it. It was

an accident. I can promise you

faithfully it won't be repeated.

Finally Al Capone speaks.   He leans across his desk, bugs

out his eyes, and hisses:

97.

114   CONTINUED:                                               114

AL CAPONE (V.O.)

(on T.V.)

Why don't you take a little ride

with Frank?

The man's eyes bulge with fear, and he cries, "No!    No!"

as two men escort him out the door.

In the next shot we see a long black car parked on a

country road, and we hear a SHOT.

115   INT. BATHROOM - SAME NIGHT (LATER)                             115

Toby is brushing his teeth when Dwight enters.

TOBY

I'll be through in a minute.

Dwight looks around.

DWIGHT

You left the lid off the damn

toothpaste again.

TOBY

(not looking at him)

Oh, Dwight, is that the best you

can come up with?

Angered, but keeping his voice low.   He pushes Toby's

shoulder.

DWIGHT

This is my bathroom, and I say

about the toothpaste, got it?

(pushes again)

Huh? Have you? Huh? Now if you

lived with your daddy Duke and

his rich wife, maybe things'd be

different, but he's not here now,

is he?

(high, flutey voice)

Oh, Duke? Duke, are you here?

Dukie? Oh, how sad -- Duke's not

here. Oh, boo hoo!

(normal voice)

My bathroom. I get to say. Got

that?

Still Toby doesn't respond -- Dwight reaches out and

pinches the skin on Toby's waist, hard. Toby still

doesn't respond, when Dwight begins to twist it. Toby

spins around, eyes blazing.

(CONTINUED)

98.

115   CONTINUED:                                              115

DWIGHT

Come on. Oh, come on.     Give me

an excuse.

Toby hesitates, then leaves the bathroom, humiliated.

116   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                          116

Toby exits the bathroom, then sees Caroline in a doorway.

She's heard it all. They look intently at each other.

Toby nods and walks on down the hall.

117   INT. TOBY'S ROOM - INSTANTS LATER                             117

Furious, Toby throws himself onto the bed, and snaps on

a reading light.

(Behind him, the wall is now completely papered with

the front pages of the Scout magazine, so that we see

the words BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE

repeated one hundred and twenty times.) Then Toby takes

a slick brochure from under his pillow -- it's a bro-

chure of Princeton. Photographs of beautifully tended

lawns, and students on their way to class. Toby stares

at the photographs, smoothing the pages carefully, long-

ing in his face.

118   INT. SCHOOL BUS - NEXT MORNING                                118

Toby bangs onto the bus, throws himself into a seat

beside Arthur. He hands a grade card to Toby.

ARTHUR

You didn't pick this up yesterday

-- congratulations, you got

nothing higher than a C.

TOBY

Shut up.

He signs the grade card, saying, "Presto."

ARTHUR

You're gonna get caught some day.

(as Toby laughs a

moronic laugh)

You act more like those morons you

hang around with every day. Aghhh!

I'm psycho! I'm retarded!

(CONTINUED)

99.

118   CONTINUED:                                              118

It's a good imitation of Psycho, and Toby laughs.

TOBY

He hears you do that, you're

dead. Hey, lemme copy your math

homework.

ARTHUR

No, but I'll show you how to work

the problems.

TOBY

I tell you I'm thirsty, you offer

me a sandwich thank you and fuck

you.

ARTHUR

Oh, Jack.

TOBY

Oh, Jaaack!

ARTHUR

I take it back you don't act like

Psycho, you act like Dwight.

TOBY

(new tone)

I know it. He's winning. I do

act like him. I feel like him

sometimes. I've gotta get out of

this place or I'm a dead one.

ARTHUR

I know, but you've said that for

two years.

TOBY

I mean it. I may go live with my

brother Gregory in Princeton.

ARTHUR

You mean the brother Gregory in

Princeton who never calls you?

That brother Gregory?

TOBY

He wrote me.

ARTHUR

And he asked you to live with him?

(CONTINUED)

100.

118   CONTINUED:   (2)                                            118

TOBY

No. But I'm going. Or maybe I

could go to a prep school like

Gregory did. Like my dad did.

ARTHUR

What about your grades? And what

would you use for money?

TOBY

I don't know. Dwight owes me

over twelve hundred bucks! If I

hadn't let him keep my paper

route money, I'd be okay.

ARTHUR

If the dog hadn't stopped to pee,

he'd have caught the rabbit.

Suddenly Toby is angry.   He stands up, moves to another

seat.

TOBY

I think Dwight was right about

you I think you fight for the pink

team.

Toby falls into another seat, then, pulls his head back

and bangs it against the window. Then does it again,

harder.

119   EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON                   119

His mood even fouler, Toby toils at his paper route. He

throws the papers against the houses with all his might.

Suddenly Chuck Bolger's CAR SCREECHES to a stop next to

Toby. We hear Psycho's "Arghhh!" and Toby climbs into

the car.

120   EXT. DERELICT CRUSHER PLANT - NIGHT                         120

We see the Concrete silo dimly-lit in the distance. We

can read "Welcome To Concrete" on it. Toby is leaning

against a wall in a large derelict Concrete plant staring

at the silo. Behind him is a small campfire where the

other guys are slumped around talking. Toby takes a

long, angry pull on a bottle of whiskey, then turns

around and heads toward them.

ARCH

Nobody in your family ever even

been in a Corvette, let alone

owned one.

CHUCK

You wait and see if I don't get

one. I'm gonna move down to

Seattle, get a job at Bendix and

drive a 'Vette to work every day.

JERRY

My uncle can have any car he

wants. He makes big bucks as an

electrician.

ARCH

Yeah?   How big?

JERRY

Hundred seventy-five a week, take

home.

PSYCHO

Bullshitter!

JERRY

Fuck you, it's true.

CHUCK

Even the supervisors at Bendix

don't make that.

JERRY

So how are you ever gonna make

enough to drive a 'Vette then,

fuck-face?

The others all laugh at Chuck. Toby has reached the

group and stands on the lip of the large wooden platform

that they are on and listens while leaning on a large

hook.

PSYCHO

I'm gonna drive a T-bird, someday.

CHUCK

An' I'm gonna own a Corvette if I

have to hold up the Bendix payroll

to get it.

JERRY

Fuck you.

ARCH

Me. I want to eat a big

red-haired pussy.

The others all laugh at him.     Toby regards them with a

sneer.

TOBY

Losers.   What a bunch of losers.

CHUCK

Who you calling a loser,

fuck-face?

TOBY

All of you.

(to Chuck)

You're gonna drive a Fairlane

just like your daddy does.

(to Psycho)

How you ever going to drive a

Thunderbird when you're a janitor

like the rest of your family?

(to Jerry)

An' you can forget being an

electrician, you can't even pass

tenth grade math.

JERRY

Well fuck you.     Who died an' made

you King Shit?

PSYCHO

Yeah, you're no better than us.

TOBY

I know that, Psycho. That's my

point: Ha, ha, ha. You guys are

my buddies. You guys are my pals.

And my dear old dad's called

Dwight.

(he spreads his

arms wide)

Welcome to Concreeee...

Toby topples over and falls down a bank of rubble. The

other burst out laughing and hooting. The CAMERA MOVES

off them and CRANES DOWN to a spread-eagled Toby's face.

The LAUGHTER ECHOES around the building. Toby begins to

laugh, but it soon turns to bitter tears.

122   INT. KENNEDY CAMPAIGN OFFICE - DAY                         122

Toby enters the small office where Caroline is running

hundreds of flyers on a duplicating machine. Surprised

she sees Toby's expression.

CAROLINE

What is it?

TOBY

I called Gregory at Princeton.

(as Caroline reacts)

He's sending me applications for

prep schools. I need you to

take me to Seattle to take some

entrance exams.

CAROLINE

Would a prep school take you

with, uh, your school record?

TOBY

I've got to get out of here, Mom.

I've got to. I've got to get

away.

CAROLINE

When are the tests?

TOBY

Saturday.

CAROLINE

You'll be there.

TOBY

He won't let you have the Buick.

CAROLINE

You'll be there!

123   EXT. LAKESIDE SCHOOL IN SEATTLE - DAY                      123

Graceful buildings, green lawns, a CARILLON CHIMING.

Toby walks toward a large building.

124   INT./EXT. TESTING ROOM - DAY                               124

Twenty-three boys and Toby stand waiting restlessly for

the tests to begin. Toby looks very different from the

other intelligent looking, well-bred boys in his Elvis

hairdo.

103A.

124A   SAME SCENE - LATER                                   124A

All the boys are taking the test, working hard.

125    INT. DWIGHT'S BUICK - LATE AFTERNOON                 125

Caroline turns as Toby gets into the car.

CAROLINE

How was it?

TOBY

Hard. I think I did okay.    I'll

know Monday.

104.

126   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S KITCHEN - EVENING                126

Dwight sits at the table, a drink in his hand. Caroline

hurriedly prepares dinner. She tosses a milk carton into

a brimming waste basket, then speaks to Toby, who enters

the room.

CAROLINE

Take that trash out for me,

honey.

Toby grabs the trash and exits.

127   EXT. REAR OF DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - EVENING          127

Toby opens a metal trash can, dumps the trash, puts the

lid back on, and then hesitates. He lifts the lid again

and peers into the trash can, almost hidden, are the tips

of four white envelopes made of heavy, expensive paper.

He pulls them up and, though covered with tomato seeds,

are undamaged.

128   INT. KITCHEN - EVENING                                      128

Toby walks in, fans out the four envelopes, speaks to

Caroline.

TOBY

My application forms must've come

today, and he threw them away.

DWIGHT

Hey, I thought I was helping

him -- thought I'd save him some

trouble 'cause he's got no chance

of getting into some fancy prep

school.

CAROLINE

You've always got your nose

pressed up against the bake shop

window, don't you, Dwight?

DWIGHT

What?

CAROLINE

You feel like everybody else is

inside, and you're stuck on the

outside. It turns you mean. It

turns you ugly. And one day do

you hear me, Dwight? One day all

that ugliness is going to snap

back and hit you in the face.

Ooooooh, oh, I'm so scared.   Oooh.

129   INT. TOBY'S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT                             129

Toby has the applications open in front of him. We

see the words "Official Transcript Required" on one

application. On another we see spaces for the ap-

plicant to list "Community Services" and "Athletic

Achievements" and "Foreign Travel" and "Languages." Toby

looks despairingly at the forms.

130   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING                                130

Between classes, Toby and Arthur are at a row of lockers.

ARTHUR

I won't do it.

TOBY

But why? You work right in the

office -- nobody'll ever know.

ARTHUR

I'm surprised you'd want help from

anybody who fights for the pink

team.

TOBY

I'm asking you to help me, man.

I got word yesterday that I did

really well on those tests -- but

that's not enough. I've got to

cheat and lie -- but I don't care:

this is my one chance to get out

of here!

ARTHUR

No. Why should you get to be the

one? Why not me?

131   INT. SCHOOL WORKSHOP - DAY                                   131

Toby is working with a table saw. Suddenly a two-inch-

thick manilla envelope plops down beside him. He looks

up to see Arthur standing beside him. Glancing around to

see that he's unobserved, he checks the contents of the

envelope: we see school stationery, blank transcript

forms, and a stack of official envelopes. Toby closes

his eyes. He's saved.

(CONTINUED)

106.

131   CONTINUED:                                                  131

TOBY

You could leave too, you know.

ARTHUR

No, I've grown progressively fond

of Concrete. I think I'll stay

here all alone and dress up in my

mama's old clothes sometimes --

like you said.

Arthur turns and    swishes away. Toby pats   the manilla

envelope, turns    back to the saw. Suddenly   he jerks,

looks down, and    sees that the ring finger  of his left

hand is spurting    blood. Toby says a mild,   astonished

"Hey," and sinks    to his knees.

132   INT. TYPING LAB - SAME DAY (AFTERNOON)                            132

With his hand bandaged Toby sits at a typewriter with

a blank transcript. He carefully types "TOBIAS WOLFF."

Then, he begins to type the letter "A" in every slot for

grades.

133   EXT. STREET - EVENING                                             133

Toby mails five letters.

134   INT. TOBY'S BEDROOM - DAY                                         134

Toby lies in bed reading the paper. He still holds his

hand in the air (the white bandage is now dingy).

Caroline appears in the doorway.

CAROLINE

Come help me stuff envelopes.

TOBY

I'll do some this afternoon.

CAROLINE

No, I need to take them with me.

TOBY

I'll be in in a minute.    Let me

finish this article.

(CONTINUED)

107.

134   CONTINUED:                                              134

CAROLINE

Boy, you irritate me.

(new tone)

I think maybe you ought to...

Yeah -- I think maybe you should

just...

(hisses)

... TAKE A LITTLE RIDE WITH

DWIGHT.

Toby laughs, and gets up to help her.

135   EXT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING              135

Toby starts up the sideway, Pearl exits the house with

several letters in her hand.

PEARL

'You got letters from those

schools!'

Toby grabs them as if they were the very stuff of life.

Pearl stands expectantly. Toby notices her, then walks

off holding the letters to his chest.

136   EXT. FIELD - EARLY EVENING                                    136

Three letters lie crumpled on the ground. Toby sits with

his back against a tree trunk. Slowly Toby opens the

fourth letter. Another refusal. Toby tosses it onto

the ground with the others, leans his head back against

the tree trunk, and closes his eyes.

137   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                137

Dwight, Caroline and Toby read the papers.   Caroline

notices Toby's sad face.

CAROLINE

Maybe that last school will

come through.

DWIGHT

Yeah, or maybe he'll get a

contract in the mail asking him

to be a singing star on T.V.

(on Caroline's look)

Well, he's got about as much

chance of one as of the other.

Toby gets up and leaves.

108.

138    EXT. CONCRETE - SAME NIGHT                                  138

A beauty shop with a tired sign... "ARLENE'S GOLDEN COMB

BEAUTY SALON," a beer joint, a pool hall, a woman's

clothing store with headless mannequins.

Toby surveys the scene, with an expression of despair.

Toby catches his reflection in a store window.     He

stares at himself.

TOBY

A Concrete boy.

139    INT. A&P GROCERY STORE - EVENING                            139

Toby, wearing khakis, a shirt and a tie stands before

the store manager.

MANAGER

We only take boys who really want

to work hard. Is that you?

(as Toby nods)

I'd want you to start evenings

now, and I'd want you all summer

-- no vacations.

(as Toby nods)

Food service work isn't easy.

It's not something that comes to

you in a year or two. So. You

think you have what it takes to

be an A&P management trainee?

TOBY

(straight)

That's exactly what I've got.

139A   SAME SCENE - LATER                                          139A

Toby now wears a regulation black bow tie and an apron.

An employee is showing him how to price, stamp, and stack

canned goods. Toby's face is expressionless.

140    INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON     140

Dwight is listening to a PERRY COMO ALBUM.     Caroline and

Pearl work on a jigsaw puzzle. Toby enters     the kitchen,

coming from his paper route. He puts down     his paper sack

and immediately puts on his black bow tie,    preparing to

go to the A&P.

(CONTINUED)

140   CONTINUED:                                             140

PEARL

I can't find where this green piece

goes -- it's gotta be grass.

Dwight sighs with irritation at the interruption of his

listening pleasure, and turns UP the VOLUME on the record.

CAROLINE

(to Toby)

Don't go off without eating.

TOBY

I'll get a sandwich after work.

Exasperated that conversation is continuing when he's

trying to listen, Dwight reaches over, presses his hand

down on the arm of the record player, then SCRAPES it

back and forth on the record. It's a violent action, and

it makes a GROTESQUE SOUND. The NEEDLE BOUNCES around

on the scarred record. As the three of them stare at

him, Dwight speaks calmly:

DWIGHT

I was trying to listen to a

record.

Dwight rises, walks outside into the back yard. Then

the TELEPHONE RINGS. Pearl answers it, listens, then

says,

PEARL

"Yeah, he's here,"

She holds the receiver out to Toby, whispering, "Are

you Tobias?"

TOBY

Hello? All right.     Tomorrow, then.

Goodbye.

Toby hangs up, turns to Caroline, quietly:

TOBY

It's Hill School -- the last one

I applied to. They haven't

accepted me, but they're sending

somebody up to interview me.

Caroline upsets the puzzle getting up to hug Toby.

110.

141   INT. DRUGSTORE - AFTERNOON                                  141

Toby is sitting in a booth with MR. HOWARD, a man in his

late thirties.

Toby has made a real attempt to look good.    His hair is

modified, and he wears a tie and a suit.

TOBY

... Yeah, I enjoy my classes,

especially the ones that are

advanced, but I've been feeling

a little restless lately. It's

hard to explain.

MR. HOWARD

Well, you're probably bored. Not

being challenged. Your application

was very good, Toby, but we have

many boys who want to go to Hill.

Not everybody is comfortable at a

prep school.

TOBY

I think I would be. My father

and brother went to prep schools.

MR. HOWARD

Is that right?     Where?

TOBY

Deerfield and Choate.

Mr. Howard is impressed.

MR. HOWARD

I see. Well, maybe you'd like it.

Hill was difficult for me, though

-- classes were hard, and the boys

seemed cold -- interested in money

and social position.

(laughs)

And I hated those snowy

Pennsylvania winters! But then

in my last year, something changed.

The guys in my class grew close,

so close that I still think of

them as a second family.

TOBY

(honest)

I want that. I do, and --

(CONTINUED)

111.

141   CONTINUED:                                              141

He stops    talking as we hear, O.S., "AG-H-H-H!" Psycho and

Arch have    entered the drugstore. Toby's back is to the

door, and    he slouches deeper into the booth, praying that

he won't    be seen.

Arch and Psycho buy cigarettes.

ARCH

... so she said, 'No, I don't want

you to do that,' and I said 'Oh,

baby, let me get down and grovel

on it.' I mean, I ate her pussy

'til my tongue was calloused, and

then...

Arch moves toward the    back of the store toward the area

where Toby sits. Toby     inches down a bit farther into the

booth. Arch stops at     a sunglass rack five feet from Toby

and tries on a couple    of pairs.

ARCH

... so anyway, she went off like a

Roman candle -- I mean that woman

can scream. I said, 'You liked

that, didn't you, baby?' I said,

'You liked the old Arch Cook

special, didn't you?'

Arch decides to let the sunglasses go. He and Psycho

move toward the front of the store, he talks about pussy.

Toby exhales.

MR. HOWARD

Toby, boys at Hill talk roughly

sometimes too -- you'd have to

be ready for that. I can see

you've had sort of a sheltered

life.

Toby nods his head.

142   EXT. DRUGSTORE - AFTERNOON                                    142

Mr. Howard shakes Toby's hand.

MR. HOWARD

You seem like a fine boy, and

I'll give you a good report

tomorrow. But there are lots of

boys applying, and we'll just

have to wait and see whether --

From O.S., we hear Dwight's voice, and Toby goes rigid.

DWIGHT (O.S.)

Ohh, it's the Hotshot Boy.

Both Mr. Howard and Toby turn to see Dwight, wearing

his coveralls, ten feet away.

DWIGHT

Yeah, it's the guy who thinks he

knows everything. Thinks he's so

smart, but fella, what you don't

know would fill a book.

(glances at Mr.

Howard's new

Chevrolet; offhand)

General Motors makes shit cars.

Dwight turns and enters the drugstore.

TOBY

(weakly)

That's, uh, that's this guy...

he's a mechanic... did some bad

work on our car...

It's not much of an explanation, but Mr. Howard seems to

buy it. He says goodbye to Toby, gets into his car,

drives away. Toby stares after him.

DISSOLVE TO:

143   INT. A & P GROCERY STORE - NIGHT                              143

A few weeks have passed. Toby (his Elvis hairdo further

modified) again prices and stacks food. His face is

serious, his manner industrious.

144   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON                144

Toby walks in; his Elvis hair disappearing.    Pearl, who

is boiling hot dogs, turns:

PEARL

I know something'll make you feel

good: that man called -- you got

the scholarship.

Toby grits his teeth and clenches both fists victoriously.

He's won.

(CONTINUED)

113.

144   CONTINUED:                                              144

PEARL

He said they're gonna give you two

thousand three hundred dollars a

year and it costs two thousand

five hundred dollars... so you

gotta come up with the other two

hundred. Great, huh?

(sympathetic)

I'm making hot dogs -- I'll make

one for you. Can you put mustard

on some bread for us?

Toby gets a jar of mustard from a cupboard, but it's

empty, so he tosses it on top of the trash can, gets a

new jar and starts to open it.

Dwight enters.

PEARL

What're you doing home so earl...

Oh! Toby he got that scholarship

-- two thousand and three hundred

dollars!

Dwight makes himself a drink, takes two large swallows,

then turns to Toby.

DWIGHT

Hey, leopard. I say, 'Hey,

leopard.' I know you, leopard --

I can see those spots you can't

change.

(laughs)

Thinks he can go to some fancy

prep school and fool everybody.

Not a chance. I know a thing or

two about a thing or two.

Toby won't rise to the bait, and Dwight falls silent, he,

looks around and sees the jar of mustard on top of the

trash.

DWIGHT

Who threw that away?

TOBY

I did.

DWIGHT

Why?

TOBY

Because it was empty.

(CONTINUED)

114.

144   CONTINUED:   (2)                                           144

Dwight retrieves the bottle. There are a few streaks

of mustard under the neck of the bottle. He holds it

close to Toby's face.

DWIGHT

Empty?   That look empty to you?

PEARL

It looks empty to me.

TOBY

It looks empty to me, too.

Dwight pushes the jar against Toby's eye, leaving mustard

stains on the boy's face.

DWIGHT

Look again, hotshot.    Is it empty?

Toby jerks his head away, not answering. Dwight slams

down the jar of mustard, grabs Toby by the back of the

hair and forces his face down against the mustard jar.

PEARL

Dad!

DWIGHT

(to Toby)

Now. Now, Mr. Big-Time Prep-

School fucker, is it empty?

Toby struggles, but Dwight has the strength of anger:

trying always to protect his throbbing finger, Toby

pulls free and jumps up from the table. Dwight is too

quick for Toby, though: he grabs an even bigger handful

of hair and forces Toby's face down onto the mustard

jar again and again. And again. Each time he asks if

the jar is empty. Finally, Toby gives up.

TOBY

(muffled)

No, it wasn't empty.

DWIGHT

(lets him go)

All right -- clean it out.

His face smeared with mustard, Toby's expression is

murderous. He picks up a knife and scrapes at the mus-

tard, trying to get up under the neck. He manages to

get a few brown and yellow smudges on the knife, which

he transfers to the edge of a plate. Dwight watches.

(CONTINUED)

144   CONTINUED:   (3)                                           144

DWIGHT

Now.     Was it empty?

Slowly he stands up and faces Dwight.

TOBY

Yes!

Dwight slaps Toby across the mouth and the battle is on.

As Pearl stands frozen, Toby lunges at Dwight, they

grapple and stagger around the room. GLASS SHATTERS, the

kitchen table CRASHES over, and their feet STAMP and

SHUFFLE but Toby is a wild man. Even though he has

only one good hand. He lands a blow between Dwight's

eyes that bangs the man back against the wall.

Dwight grabs the pan with the hot water from the hotdogs,

flings it at Toby. Most of it misses. Again they

grapple. Toby manages to throw Dwight down, then grabs a

broom that has fallen to the floor, presses it against

Dwight's throat, using his good hand and one knee.

Dwight's mouth gapes wide, his eyes bulge, and he jerks

himself frantically trying to dislodge Toby, but Toby

hangs on like grim death. Desperate, Dwight grabs Toby's

bandaged hand, bringing it close to his own face, and

bites the stump of Toby's injured finger as hard as he

can.

Toby and Pearl scream simultaneously. Pearl in horror,

Toby in pain. Pearl runs into her bedroom. Toby reels

back in pain, holding his freshly-bleeding hand. Dwight

takes his chance, grabs Toby by the throat, forces him

down onto the floor and begins to choke the boy. Toby's

eyelids begin to flutter. He's losing consciousness.

WHAM!

From out of nowhere a baseball bat hits Dwight flat

across the shoulder blades, knocking the breath out  of

him, stunning him momentarily. As he looks up, we   see

Caroline, one of the baseball bats from the utility  porch

drawn back, aimed at Dwight's head, ready to strike  again.

CAROLINE

(level)

Get away from him or I will kill

you.

Toby manages to stand up, Caroline speaks to both of them.

CAROLINE

What is this?

TOBY

I got the scholarship and he went

nuts. He's crazy, and I'm leaving.

(screams it)

I'm leaving!

DWIGHT

Great.   Go!

TOBY

Give me my paper route money, and

you'll never have to see my face

again.

DWIGHT

(manages a smile)

That money is gone with the wind.

(as Toby stares)

That's right. I spent it as you

made it. It's gone. Poof.

Toby starts for Dwight again. Caroline grabs him, saying,

"No. No. No," over and over, literally dragging Toby

away from Dwight.

Caroline looks at Dwight.

CAROLINE

It's not so much that you're

disappointing -- it's that you're

consistently disappointing.

DWIGHT

Oh, fancy, fancy talk -- fancy

talk for a whore.    I know a thing

or two about a thing or two. I

got friends in this town that tell

me things, and I found out some man

down at that campaign headquarters

found you a job in Washington, D.C.

Gonna run off with him, aren't

you, Miss Whore?

CAROLINE

He's just a friend.

DWIGHT

Miss Liar.     Miss Whore Liar.

TOBY

I'm leaving, Mom. You can leave,

too. You don't have to stay here.

(CONTINUED)

117.

144   CONTINUED:   (5)                                            144

Caroline takes three full beats and then her face

changes. She speaks wonderingly:

CAROLINE

I don't, do I?

TOBY

No, you don't.

CAROLINE

I could leave with you, couldn't

I?

TOBY

Yes, you could!

DWIGHT

What about me?

CAROLINE

I could just walk right out that

door, couldn't I?

TOBY

Yes, you could!

Caroline takes a deep breath, a weight has been lifted.

CAROLINE

My God... the lightness.

DWIGHT

What about me?

CAROLINE

I'm leaving, too.

DWIGHT

No.

CAROLINE

Oh, Dwight, why do you want me to

stay? You don't even like me,

not really.

DWIGHT

You're not leaving!

CAROLINE

(gentle)

Look again, Dwight -- I'm already

gone.

(CONTINUED)

118.

144   CONTINUED:   (6)                                            144

Dwight makes a terrible noise of frustration and rage,

doubles his fists, and starts toward Caroline.

Immediately Toby grabs the baseball bat and holds it

out, ready to strike, as the two begin to back toward

the door.

DWIGHT

... you two've always sided in

against me, always thought you

were better than me. I tried. I

did the best I could. What about

me? Am I supposed to just crawl

off in a ditch someplace and die?

I've always been the nigger.

Everybody's nigger. Ever since I

was little.

Caroline and Toby are at the door, run across the yard

and down the street. Dwight stands in the doorway,

yelling:

DWIGHT

What about me? When is it ever

Dwight's turn for some

consideration? What about me?

I'll tell you one thing --

you'll remember me!

145   EXT. FIELD - MINUTES LATER                                  145

Caroline and Toby slow to a walk after running, laughing,

and catch their breaths.

CAROLINE

Man, oh man.

TOBY

Man, oh man, oh man.

CAROLINE

Well, we're out.

TOBY

Great, isn't it?

CAROLINE

Yes. It's great. And you got the

scholarship! Congratulations,

honey.

(CONTINUED)

119.

145   CONTINUED:                                             145

TOBY

Yeah, I'm out! I'm outta here!

Maybe I'll crash and burn, but

it's a chance, so I'm gone! I'm

history, Histoire. Nobody's

gonna tell me what to do now,

nobody. I'm free as a bird.

Sayonara nest.

(yells it; really

bawls it out)

Heaven on a June day!

Caroline's smile becomes fixed during Toby's speech and

she begins to regard him oddly.

CAROLINE

(weakly)

Yeah, heaven on a June day...

TOBY

What'd he say about you having a

job in D.C.?

CAROLINE

Oh, Helen found me something in a

real estate office, but...

TOBY

So now you can go! Oh. Oh! I am

so damn glad to get out of this

place! I'll be in 'fourth form.'

Doesn't that sound great? And if

you get a two-bedroom place in

D.C., I can come for vacations and

summers. I'm out. I'm out!

Caroline's eyes well up, and she lights a cigarette.

TOBY

(notices she's upset)

What? Oh, don't cry -- he's not

worth it.

As sad as she is, Caroline smiles...

TOBY

She holds Toby at arm's length and studies him.

CAROLINE

My you've grown, haven't you.

Then clutches him to her fiercely.   Smiling, the two

walk on through the sunny afternoon, singing softly to

each other.

120.

146   EXT. BUS STATION - DAY                                        146

Caroline and Toby stand next to a bus as the driver

STARTS the ENGINE. She is close to tears.

CAROLINE

Are you sure you'll be all right?

TOBY

(nice)

Get on the bus.

CAROLINE

(stuffing bills into

his pocket)

I borrowed money from everybody I

know -- it's the two hundred you

need for the tuition, and an extra

fifty. Buy yourself a blazer.

Oh, God. I'll miss you. I'll

write you. You sure your hand's

okay?

TOBY

Get on the bus, Mom.

Caroline puts her arms around Toby, kisses his cheek

hard, then whispers something into his ear. When Toby

speaks, his words are full of love:

TOBY

I know that, Mom. I've always

known that.

Caroline gets onto the bus, the DOORS CLOSE, WHOOSH and

the bus pulls away. We see Caroline's face at a window.

As the bus recedes, Toby turns and walks in another

direction. His face is shining, incandescent with

happiness. He breaks into a wide grin.

FADE OUT.

THE END
