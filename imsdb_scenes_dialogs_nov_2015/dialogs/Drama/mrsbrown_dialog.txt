Mrs.Brown

BROWN

God save the Queen!!

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

PONSONBY (V.O.)

I have sent for a Mr. John BROWN from

Balmoral.  Her majesty has mentioned

him, on one or two occasions, as being

a most devoted outdoor servant to

Prince Albert during his last days

there...

CUT TO:

PONSONBY (V.O.)

... The depths of the Queen's sorrow

remain impenetrable.  She has now

restricted herself to a regime of such

ferocious introspection that we are

all at our wits' end...

PONSONBY (V.O.)

... The Household continues, at her

instruction, to observe the rituals

now so familiar to her, in a vain

attempt to render vivid that which can

never be revived...

PONSONBY (V.O.)

... It will not surprise you to hear

that she continues steadfast in her

refusal to accept any public

engagements, however trivial...

PONSONBY (V.O.)

... Family and staff expend all their

efforts endeavouring to draw her out

of this state of unfettered morbidity,

but to no avail.  Indeed, Doctor

Jenner will not undertake to vouchsafe

her sanity, unless some remedy is

found...

PONSONBY (V.O.)

... We must hope, therefore, that this

Mr Brown will appeal to the Queen's

sentimental, though deeply-held, view

that all Highlanders are good for the

health.  If she can at least be

persuaded to take the air, the

prospect of further recovery may seem

less remote...

ASSISTANT DRESSER

(terrified)

Sorry, ma'am.

PONSONBY (V.O.)

... He is arriving by boat this

afternoon, by which time it is hoped

Her Majesty will be in a fit state to

consider riding out...

PONSONBY (V.O.)

... As to that decision, along with

all others, we remain, as ever,

prisoners of the Queen's grief.

(beat)

Ever your devoted husband, Henry.

PONSONBY (CONT'D)

Windsor.

CUT TO:

JENNER

Congratulations, Your Royal Highness!

BERTIE

Thank you, Doctor.

JENNER

A boy, I hear.  Excellent, excellent.

BERTIE

Yes.

(beat)

Albert Victor.  Eddie for short.  What

do you think?

PONSONBY

A fine choice, sir.

JENNER

Excellent!

DRIVER

Are you riding up front?

BROWN

I'll stay with the pony, thank you.

She's all the way from Deeside and

she's not sure she likes you yet.

VICTORIA

How many?

LADY ELY

The Royal Family and senior members of

the household, ma'am.

VICTORIA

Just them?

LADY ELY

Yes, ma'am.

JENNER

We're expecting Brown this afternoon,

ma'am.

VICTORIA

Whom?

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

That's a very pretty shawl you are

wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.

(beat)

But you are not eating enough.  One

must not let vanity overrule one's

appetite.

PRINCESS ALEXANDRA

Yes, ma'am.

BROWN

I was due at a quarter past one.

(beat)

You're late.

PONSONBY

(in low tones)

Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House

is not as you will remember it.  The

Household remains in full mourning and

no-one is permitted to raise their

voice under any circumstances

whatsoever.  As for the Queen's

routine, she breakfasts at nine

thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at

five thirty and dinner at eight forty

five.  No one is allowed to leave the

building while the Queen is at home.

On the rare occasions when she is out,

you may ask permission to leave, but

only with my consent.

You're to be ready to walk the pony at

any time after ten o'clock.  You'll

clean her outdoor things and do any

odd jobs as and when she requires.

BROWN

How will I know?

PONSONBY

(surprised to be interrupted)

I'm sorry?

BROWN

How will I know what she requires?

PONSONBY

You'll be sent a message.

BROWN

Who'll bring it to me?

PONSONBY

Her Highness' Equerry.

BROWN

I need a man who knows where I am.

PONSONBY

I'm sure it won't be difficult to find

you.

BROWN

That's not good enough.

PONSONBY

Then we'll have to see what can be

arranged.

BROWN

Aye, do.

PONSONBY

There is to be no communication with

other members of the household on

matters concerning the court except

through myself or one of the

Equerries.  No plans must be altered

unless you are given prior authority

by myself or a senior member of the

household.

BROWN

I came down at the Queen's request.

I'll take my orders from her.

PONSONBY

In matters concerning the Household, I

act on her behalf.

BROWN

Do you?

PONSONBY

Yes.

(beat)

I do.

BROWN

So, is passing wind out of the

question or do I need permission for

that?

PONSONBY

As I am sure you remember from

Balmoral, you do not talk while in Her

Majesty's presence unless Her Majesty

addresses you directly.

PONSONBY (O.S.)

Mr Brown, ma'am.

VICTORIA

Mr Brown.

BROWN

Ma'am.

VICTORIA

You are here safely.

BROWN

Aye, ma'am.

VICTORIA

You are well?

BROWN

I am.

VICTORIA

And the pony?

BROWN

She's well, too.

VICTORIA

Your family sent cards.  It was much

appreciated.

BROWN

I'm glad of it.

VICTORIA

My husband was always very

complimentary in speaking of you.  He

would have approved, I am sure, of my

calling on you in this way.

(beat)

I trust it does not inconvenience you

too much.

BROWN

I've no family, ma'am, apart from my

brothers and sisters.

VICTORIA

Yes.

(beat)

You have a brother in service here, do

you not?

(furrowing her brow)

I forget his name.

BROWN

Archie.

VICTORIA

Yes.

(beat)

That will be company for you.

BROWN

Yes, ma'am.

BROWN (CONT'D)

Honest to God, I never thought to see

you in such a state.  You must miss

him dreadfully.

VICTORIA

You do not - he ... get him out.

(beat)

Get him out.  Get him out!

ARCHIE

(telling it fast)

So the day they arrive, she greets the

Sultan and his family with barely a

word and then retires to her chamber.

The Sultan, not used to State

Occasions without a head of State, is

standing in the lobby waiting for

someone to tell him what to do.  But

the court is under strict instructions

not to talk in the corridors so nobody

speaks to him, not a living soul, for

the whole afternoon.  So now it's

dinner and everyone's standing round

the table -- still not a word --

waiting for Her Majesty to arrive.

One hour goes by, two, the Sultan's

getting a wee bit peckish to say the

least.  So finally, his wee laddy

breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a

slice in his mouth.  Well, the uproar

when she heard.  You'd have thought

someone had stolen the crown jewels.

BROWN

So?

ARCHIE

So, there are rules.  Things you do

and things you don't do.

BROWN

I was just telling the woman how I

feel, for God's sake.

ARCHIE

You don't tell Her Majesty how you

feel.

BROWN

I speak as I find, Archie.

ARCHIE

Not down south you don't.

ARCHIE (CONT'D)

So what did Ponsonby do when she

started shouting?

BROWN

I think he nearly ruptured his truss.

BROWN

How much?

ARCHIE

Seventy a year.

BROWN

Not bad, not bad.

ARCHIE

How about yourself?

BROWN

Sixty.

ARCHIE

(grinning)

That's pretty good for a ghillie.

BROWN

Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who

bleeds all day?  So what does his

valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?

ARCHIE

It's better than shovelling horse

shit.

BROWN

If you were looking for promotion, you

should have picked one of the

healthier ones.

ARCHIE

She's hardly a full hamper herself.

BROWN

(beat)

It's only grief makes her like she is.

ARCHIE

Three years, John.  Is that not a bit

long to be grieving?

BROWN

She loved him.

ARCHIE

Come on, man.  There's love and

there's ...

BROWN

What?

ARCHIE

You know what I mean.

BROWN

I'm not sure I do, Archie.

ARCHIE

There's love and there's behaving like

you do because there's nobody to tell

you not to.

BROWN

Which one of us is she flirting with?

ARCHIE

The good-looking one.

BROWN

Aye?  Then she's obviously not got

enough to do.

ARCHIE

You work the system right, you could

ask her yourself.  Just be thankful

you're not working for Household.  The

Queen never lets them out of her

sight.  But wee spats like us can slip

through the net, easy.

BROWN

I'm no wee spat, ARCHIE.

VICTORIA

(as if she had not seem him

earlier)

Who is that?

LADY ELY

It's Mr Brown, ma'am.

VICTORIA

What is he doing there?

LADY ELY

He appears to be ... standing by his

horse.

VICTORIA

I made no request to go out riding

today.

(beat)

How long has he been there?

LADY ELY

I don't know, ma'am.

(nervously)

He was observed earlier, I believe.

VICTORIA

Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the

courtyard.  I have no wish to go

riding.

PONSONBY

I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't

imagine -- he was certainly given no

instructions.

VICTORIA

Please make sure it does not happen

again.

PONSONBY

Of course, at once.

PONSONBY

What on earth did you think you were

doing?

BROWN

Awaiting my orders.

PONSONBY

You do not report for duty unless the

Queen requests it.  You know that very

well.

BROWN

I didn't come all this way to sit on

my arse.

PONSONBY

You will await your orders like

everyone else.  Unless you prefer a

repeat of yesterday's little

excitement.

BROWN

No.

PONSONBY

I beg your pardon?

PONSONBY

I thought I made myself perfectly

clear.  You do not leave your room

until Her Majesty requests it.

BROWN

(eyes straight ahead,

shouting back)

Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if

her husband was here now, he'd have

had her out of that house and getting

some air in her.  What the hell's the

point in me being here otherwise?!

PONSONBY

Go inside at once.

BROWN

Is that the Queen's request?

PONSONBY

Yes, it most certainly is!

VICTORIA

Mr Brown.

BROWN

Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA

You have been told repeatedly not to

stand in the courtyard unless

requested to do so.

BROWN

Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA

Then why do you persist in doing it?

BROWN

Because I think Her Majesty is wrong.

If ever there was a poor soul who

needed fresh air, it is her.

VICTORIA

The Queen will ride out if and when

she chooses.

BROWN

And I intend to be there when she's

ready.

VICTORIA

Prince Albert was going to build a

bench here.  He thought it one of the

best views in Osborne.

BROWN

It's a fine spot, ma'am.

VICTORIA

He thought so, yes.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

In everything I do and everything I

say, I try to think, as much as

possible, what he would do, or say, if

he were here now.  My Private

Secretary wishes me to return to

public duties--

BROWN

If Prince Albert were here today, he'd

tell him a thing or two.

VICTORIA

Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish

it.

(beat)

The same people who refused to grant

my husband the title of King because

he was deemed of insufficient rank--

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

It is a fine spot for a bench, is it

not?

BROWN

Aye, ma'am.

VICTORIA

Yes.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

I have some letters in the saddle bag.

I wish to read them.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

I cannot read them like that.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

You will hand them to me as I require.

BERTIE'S VALET

Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits

there.

BROWN

Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.

BERTIE'S VALET

By whose authority?

BROWN

My own.

BERTIE'S VALET

The order of seating at the Upper

Servant's table is arranged personally

by the Queen herself.

BROWN

That's a tautology lad.

(unable to stop himself

seriously explaining it)

If you say the Queen arranges

something, you've no need to say she's

done it personally.  That's

understood.

BROWN (CONT'D)

Are you dresser to Her Majesty?

ASSISTANT DRESSER

Assistant, sir, yes.

BROWN

What's your name?

ASSISTANT DRESSER

Mary Taylor, sir.

BROWN

Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?

ASSISTANT DRESSER

I hope to go up next year.

BROWN

You wouldn't happen to know what the

Queen's reading for recreation, would

you, Mary?

ASSISTANT DRESSER

Lord Tennyson, sir?

BROWN

Am I the only one eating?

PONSONBY

Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation,

at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve

by a picnic in the grounds to

celebrate Princess Alice's birthday.

Dispatches, as usual, at two.

(finishes, then coughs)

The Chancellor writes to say that, by

happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes

for the weekend.  He asks if Your

Majesty might grant him an audience.

VICTORIA

Why?

PONSONBY

He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty

might wish to be informed of the

latest developments in government.

VICTORIA

No.  I shall be out walking.

PONSONBY

Then perhaps Your Majesty might

consider it opportune if the Prince of

Wales were to meet him on your behalf?

VICTORIA

On no account.

BERTIE

Mama, I really do think it's time we

made ourselves a little more ...

available.

BERTIE (CONT'D)

I think we must accept our position in

the country is not entirely unrelated

to the continued absence of the

Monarchy from public life.

(silence)

I thought perhaps we might consider a

small gesture of some kind?

VICTORIA

Gesture?

BERTIE

I thought, a dinner for our

ambassadors perhaps?

VICTORIA

(cutting in firmly)

No dinners, Bertie.

(beat)

Why are you dressed for outdoors?

BERTIE

It's so infernally cold in here.

VICTORIA

Cold is good--

(calling across)

Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!

JENNER

I'm sorry, ma'am?

VICTORIA

Cold is good!

JENNER

Excellent, ma'am, excellent.

(trying his hand)

But perhaps if her Majesty were to

consider accompanying her new-found

physical vigor with the benefits of

mental activity...

VICTORIA

(becoming very agitated)

Why am I being lectured in this way?!

JENNER

Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way

did I wish to suggest--

VICTORIA

(cutting across him)

I will not tolerate anybody lecturing

me about the responsibility of the

monarchy....

BERTIE

Mother....

VICTORIA

... Least of all my son.  It was his

irresponsibility that drove my husband

to his grave.

BERTIE

If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty,

then perhaps she might consider

allowing the Prince of Wales to host--

VICTORIA

I do believe they send so many boxes

to taunt me.

Doctor Jenner writes to them to say

that my nerves are in an extremely

fragile state and yet they continue to

hound me with box after box after box

after box after box!

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

I wish to take the Princesses for a

swim.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

The turns I have been taking in the

grounds have proved most beneficial to

me, and Brown thinks that salt water

will do me good.

VICTORIA

Don't potter, children.  Swim.

BROWN

You could buy that lot for garden

ornaments and still see change from

ten guineas.

BROWN (CONT'D)

Lift your foot, woman.

DISRAELI (O.S.)

This nation is fortunate in so much as

it is not governed by force...

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

DISRAELI (O.S.)

... but by a chain of traditions that

have been cherished from generation to

generation, because in them -- in our

traditions -- are embodied all the

laws which have enabled us to create

the greatest empire of modern times...

DISRAELI (CONT'D)

... but, even though we have amassed

great capital and even though we have

established an industry with no

parallel in the world, yet all these

mighty creations are as nothing

compared to the invisible customs that

shape our lives.  To those honorable

gentlemen of the opposition who seek

to destroy the essential elements of

this country, I say let them remember:

England cannot begin again.

STANLEY

Have you seen this?

STANLEY

Should we take it seriously?

DISRAELI

The cartoon or Her Majesty's

absenteeism?

STANLEY

Well, both.

DISRAELI

The question is, do we need her?

STANLEY

Surely, you're not suggesting we

dispense--

DISRAELI

My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with

only a handful of friends must respect

public opinion.

DISRAELI (CONT'D)

Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was

right.  This country is not governed

by wisdom but by talk.

(beat)

Granted, it wouldn't take much to

winkle the old girl out of mourning,

but if public opinion is against her,

then it doesn't do to appear too

close.

STANLEY

So?

DISRAELI

We'll see which way the wind blows.

BROWN

My heart's in the Highlands, my heart

is not here!  My heart's in the

Highlands a-chasing the deer!  Chasing

the wild deer and following the roe!

My heart's in the Highlands wherever I

go!

BROWN

One box of biscuits, one box of drop

tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen

chocolate sponges.  It's the same

order every week, but does anybody

bother to check it?  Now she has to

travel all the way to Balmoral without

the few luxuries she actually enjoys.

ARCHIE

So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.

BROWN

Aye, but will they?

ARCHIE

John, it's not your problem what she

eats.

BROWN

The woman's surrounded by fools!

(beat)

She has to be packed and ready to

leave by seven thirty tomorrow

morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll

still be dressing her at eight.

ARCHIE

She's got an army of people to get her

up and out.

BROWN

But I'm the only one she trusts.

ARCHIE

She'll blow hot and cold on you, John,

she always does.  You want to be

careful.

BROWN

I'm on ninety pounds a year plus

seventy pounds for a pile of tartan

I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much

as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and

that job's only for toffs.

(raising his hip flask

triumphantly at the sea)

I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant!

Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping

me now.

PONSONBY

Oh God, not the pipes!

VICTORIA

What are those?

BROWN

What?

VICTORIA

Those, over there, there.

BROWN

(horse chestnut trees...)

Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.

VICTORIA

(beat)

Craobhan-geanmchno...

(bursts out laughing)

How can I possibly say that with a

straight face?!

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

I am thinking of publishing my

"Highland Journals."

BROWN

Are they worth reading?

VICTORIA

(beat)

I am told so.

BROWN

Who by?

VICTORIA

Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are

charming.

BROWN

What does he know about the Highlands?

VICTORIA

He has been attending at Balmoral for

many years.

BROWN

That doesn't make him an expert.

VICTORIA

His remarks were directed at the

quality of the writing, not its

subject.

BROWN

I don't groom a horse to have it

admired by others, I groom it because

it needs grooming.

VICTORIA

(curtly)

I do not do it for others.  But

Ponsonby thinks they are good.

BROWN

Just say what you have to say, woman.

What other people think shouldn't

matter to you.

VICTORIA

(snapping)

Of course I shall say what I have to

say.  I always do.

BROWN

Aye, well, if all you want is a good

opinion then he'd be sure to oblige

you.

VICTORIA

(riding alongside)

What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was

their literary merit, a skill not

intimately associated with the

knowledge of grooming.

(beat)

Literary appreciation does not begin

and end with Tennyson.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

(in a softer tone)

I mention you in them.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

In particular, the occasion when

Albert was alive; the Royal Carriage

overturned during a storm and you

demonstrated such loyal service in

returning the Queen and the Princesses

safely to Balmoral.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

For friendship.

BROWN

(briskly)

She'll be away on Friday between eight

o'clock and six in the evening to

visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's

to make the journey there and back in

the day she's to have no distractions

the night before.  She'll take a light

supper alone in her private drawing

room and retire early.

PONSONBY

She'll need to sign dispatches before

she retires.

BROWN

That can wait till the weekend.

PONSONBY

There are important papers from --

BROWN

It can wait.  Anything else?

JENNER

Are you sure Her Majesty is up to such

a long journey?  She has only just

recovered from a severe head cold.

BROWN

If I thought she wasn't up to it, I

wouldn't let her go, would I?

BERTIE

Surely it is for the gentlemen to

decide when to stop...

VICTORIA

It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It

should be discouraged.

BERTIE

Yes, but isn't midnight a little

excessive?

VICTORIA

It is quite late enough.

BERTIE

But mama, the room was built expressly

for that purpose.  It has been a

smoking-room by tradition ever since

father --

VICTORIA

(cutting in angrily)

Brown's responsibilities are onerous

enough already.  He has far too much

to do without having to stay up all

night waiting for you to go to bed.

The smoking-room will be closed and

the lights put out at twelve o'clock.

BERTIE

Mama...

VICTORIA

And that is my last word on the

matter.

BERTIE

Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think

it's too much that the gentlemen of

the house should be dictated to by a

servant.

BROWN

It's the Queen's decision.

BERTIE

I beg your pardon?

(to VICTORIA)

Mama...?

BROWN

I think you should go now.

(beat)

You've tired your mother enough.

BROWN

There's really no need for this.

MRS GRANT

I'll not have her seeing it like it

is!

(beat)

I know she means well, but I wish

she'd warn us she was coming.

BROWN

She thinks if she warned you, you'd go

pouring water on the fire and stuffing

the knitting under the sofa.

MR GRANT

Aye, well, you can't stop a wife being

house-proud.

MRS GRANT

All right.

(beat)

Show her in.

BROWN

They're ready now.

VICTORIA

I hope they didn't go to any trouble,

John.

BROWN

Ah, well...

VICTORIA

Mr Grant.  How good it is to see you.

MR GRANT

(bowing deeply)

Your Majesty.

VICTORIA

Mrs Grant.  How is your knee?  Has the

pain eased a little?

MRS GRANT

(bobbing in terror)

Oh not so bad, ma'am.

VICTORIA

Good.  Oh and here are Douglas and

John.  Haven't you grown?

MRS GRANT

(still bobbing away)

Growing all the time, ma'am.

MR GRANT

Will you sit, ma'am?

VICTORIA

I know that!  That's Cairn Lochan.  We

picnicked there once, did we not,

John?

DISRAELI

Ah, the greasy pole.

MARY ANNE

Don't be facetious, dear. Remember

your position.

DISRAELI

It's my position I'm thinking of.

STANLEY

I see the Prince of Wales is here.

DISRAELI

I hope he got his mother's permission.

DISRAELI (CONT'D)

Lord Salisbury!

SOCIETY LADY 1

(ridiculously pleased with

herself)

Why is the Queen penny-wise and pound

foolish?  Because she looks after the

Browns and lets the sovereigns take

care of themselves!

DISRAELI

And in your opinion?  Is she foolish?

SOCIETY LADY 1

Well I ... well, I mean to say, it's

hardly right, is it?

DISRAELI

What?

SOCIETY LADY 1

Well, the Queen and --

(appalled whisper)

Mr Brown.

DISRAELI

La superstition met le monde entier en

flammes.

SOCIETY LADY 2

(thick as shit)

I beg your pardon?

DISRAELI

(changing tack)

Has anybody seen this ... Mr Brown?

STANLEY

He is her personal servant, I believe.

SOCIETY LADY 1

(knowingly)

Follows her wherever she goes.

DISRAELI

He would hardly make a very good

personal assistant if he did not.

MRS GRANT

... it's not my best china.  I mean,

it is my best china now, but the

family set got stolen last summer.

VICTORIA

Oh, I'm so sorry ...

MRS GRANT

Of course it was no-one on the Estate.

More likely one of the lads from

Braemar.  Or further even.

(beat)

I'll fetch the salt.

BERTIE

Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.

DISRAELI

Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure

to see you here.

BERTIE

Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in

sugar...?

DISRAELI

I don't think I've had that pleasure.

BERTIE

No doubt you've heard the rumors.

DISRAELI

I take no account of gossip, Your

Highness.

BERTIE

My concern is for the reputation of

the Monarchy.

DISRAELI

Of course.

BERTIE

I fear the influence he has on her.

The man's word is not to be credited.

He is an arriviste of the very lowest

water.

(beat)

She's having a bust cast of him.  In

Nero Marquino marble.

DISRAELI

I see.

BERTIE

I would talk to her myself, but she

won't listen to me.  She must be

persuaded, by someone she respects, to

abandon this ridiculous favoritism

before a situation develops.

DISRAELI

A situation?

BERTIE

I don't imagine you frequent the

Republican Clubs.  But the fact that

neither you nor I are members should

not blind us to the significance of

their existence.

(beat)

The Tory Party has always been our

party.

DISRAELI

I'm flattered you think so.

BERTIE

I tell you, if we don't stick together

on this, you could find yourself First

President's Opposition.

(murdering it)

Du Royaum Uni.

DISRAELI

Quite.

BERTIE

I don't think we can overstate the

seriousness of this.

STANLEY

What did he want?

DISRAELI

To know when he'll be king.

BROWN

... so Grant here and myself are

riding over Lochnagar and the rain's

pouring down in sheets and all we're

thinking about is getting home for a

drink, when through the gloom Grant

spots a couple of poachers.  He gives

me a shout and we chase them down

towards the loch until Grant has your

men up against the stacks and he's

shouting and cursing at them, "Why are

you poaching on Royal land?!"  And one

of the little fellas looks up at him

and says, "coz we've come up in the

world."

JENNER

Your Majesty!  Thank goodness you're

safe!  I'll have a bath prepared

immediately.  I recommend Macdonald's

African Embrocation --

BROWN

(cutting in)

Ah, pipe down, man.  The woman's fine.

VICTORIA

We stayed a little longer than

expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It

was most agreeable.

PONSONBY

We were expecting you to return by

six.

VICTORIA

And now I am back.

BROWN

We took a nip of whiskey.

VICTORIA

To keep out the cold.

BROWN

Aye.

VICTORIA

Thank you, John.

JENNER

(under his breath)

She's drunk.

JENNER (CONT'D)

A distinct flushing around the cheeks.

She was drunk, I tell you.

PONSONBY

No, she wasn't.

JENNER

Surely not ...

PONSONBY

Don't even think about it.

JENNER

Pandora's Box ...

VICTORIA

What is it, John?

(beat)

John?

BROWN

I heard something.

BROWN (CONT'D)

I won't be long.

JOURNALIST 1

Where did he get to?  I've lost him?

JOURNALIST 2

I don't know if there's much worth

writing about.

JOURNALIST 1

Hard to tell.

BROWN

This close enough for you?  Go on!  On

your way!  You filthy scavengers!

BROWN (CONT'D)

You leave her alone, do you hear?!

BROWN

If I catch the miserable by-blow who

told those men where she'd be, then

I'll hang his balls to dry on Jock

Wemyss, so I will!!

BROWN (CONT'D)

What happens to John Brown is his

business, but the Queen's security

will never be compromised!

BERTIE'S VALET

We --

BROWN

You'll talk when I'm finished!

BROWN (CONT'D)

That kind of disloyalty will not be

tolerated in this house, is that

clear?

(beat, yelling)

I said, is that clear?!

JENNER

"Court Circular, Balmoral."

(beat)

"On Tuesday, Mr John Brown enjoyed a

display of sheep-dipping by local

farmers.  On Wednesday, he attended a

seance where he was pleased to listen

to a recital of Auld Lang Syne by Mr

Robert Burns himself ..."

JENNER (O.S.)

"... On Thursday, Mr John Brown walked

on the slopes, accompanied by family

and friend ..."

JENNER (O.S.)

Mr Brown retired early.

BROWN

If I find out that you had anything to

do with this, I will have you sacked.

PONSONBY

I believe that decision rests with Her

Majesty.

BROWN

Don't think I can't persuade her.

PONSONBY

I don't doubt that the Queen was

highly amused.  She has always had a

very healthy sense of humor.

BROWN

This is a slur on her good name.

PONSONBY

In as much as the article is about

yourself, I think you must now accept

that the public has a right to its

interest in you.

BROWN

Nobody has any rights over me.

PONSONBY

We are all of us subject to forces

beyond our control, Mr Brown, even

you.

BROWN

You'll regret saying that.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

SPEAKER (O.S.)

Order!  Order!  ORDER!

SPEAKER (CONT'D)

Result of the vote to the first

reading of the Bill to Disestablish

the Irish Church.

SPEAKER (CONT'D)

Order!

COUNTER

Ayes to the right, three hundred and

thirty, noes to the left, two hundred

and sixty-five...

DILKE

Mr Speaker, I table a motion in

furtherance of the Bill to

Disestablish the Monarchy!

SPEAKER

Order!  Order!!  ORDER!!!

DISRAELI

We're going to lose.

STANLEY

You can't know that for sure.

DISRAELI

Gladstone's got his party facing the

same way for the first time in years.

We need help.

(long beat)

Where is the old girl?

STANLEY

Who?

DISRAELI

Mrs Brown.

STANLEY

It's questionable whether there's any

advantage to be had from that

direction.  She's never been less

popular.

DISRAELI

In the press, perhaps.

(holding up Punch)

But she's sold more copies of her

Highland Journal in three months than

Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time

to wheel her out.

STANLEY

She's refusing to leave Balmoral.

DISRAELI

What's her excuse this time?

STANLEY

The Princess Louisa is too ill to

move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather

upset at the recent spate of bad

publicity.

(beat)

You're smiling.

DISRAELI

I was trying to imagine "rather

upset."

DEAN WELLSELLY

Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.

DISRAELI

Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to

spare the time.

DEAN WELLSELLY

I came as quickly as I could.

DISRAELI

You've seen the latest cartoon in

Punch, I take it?

DEAN WELLSELLY

(completely lost)

I beg your pardon?

DISRAELI

(as Wellselly reads)

One of our madder brethren in the

house was calling for disestablishment

of the monarchy.

DEAN WELLSELLY

Good Lord.

STANLEY

(playing the soft glove)

I'm sure it won't come to that.

DISRAELI

(the hard glove)

No.  But it has now become a matter

for our consciences.

(beat)

I was just telling Stanley how vital

it is that the nation should feel the

visible influence of the Sovereign.

As a reminder that Parliament, indeed

my own ministry, depends on the will

of the Queen.

DEAN WELLSELLY

I couldn't agree with you more, but I

am only Dean of Windsor.  I don't

understand what ...

DISRAELI

We hear from Balmoral that Mr Brown is

interesting Her Majesty in some of the

forms of worship associated with ...

low-church Presbyterian.

DEAN WELLSELLY

What can we do?

DISRAELI

Oh, several things.

VICTORIA

Read it.

PONSONBY

Again?

VICTORIA

Read it!

PONSONBY

"The Times wishes to join the rest of

Her Majesty's loyal subjects in

expressing its deep joy at the news

that the Queen is soon to come out of

her mourning."

VICTORIA

Who told them that?

PONSONBY

I have no idea.

VICTORIA

Why not?

PONSONBY

I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser

than yourself.

VICTORIA

No-one should think themselves wiser

than me!

(beat)

It is not for any of the Queen's

subjects to presume to tell Her

Majesty when and where She should come

out of mourning.  It is the Queen's

sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is

Her overwhelming amount of work and

responsibility, work which She feels

will soon wear her out entirely!

PONSONBY

Your Majesty --

VICTORIA

(cutting right through him)

Is it not enough that She is uncheered

and unguided that she should also have

to suffer these malicious rumors?!

(a pause, more quietly)

I am not a fool.

(beat)

I know there are those in the

establishment too afraid to attack me

and so they attack my dearest friends.

Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all

I have left of Albert.

(beat)

And now they attack Brown too.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

I will not give him up to them.

BERTIE

I wish to see my mother.

BROWN

She's busy.

BERTIE

Convey her a message.

BROWN

She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk

to her there.

BERTIE

Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to

speak with her urgently about matters

concerning the press.

BROWN

Are you deaf as well as stupid?

BERTIE

What did you say?

BROWN

I said, are you deaf as well as

stupid?

BERTIE

Do you know who you address, sir?

BROWN

Whom you address.

BERTIE

The future King!

BROWN

Well, everyone's entitled to their

opinion.

BERTIE

Out of my way!

BROWN

LEAVE US ALONE, WHY DON'T YOU!!

BROWN

You!  What's your business here?!

UNDER-PORTER

(jumping to)

Under-porter, sir.

BROWN

Well, don't stand where you shouldn't!

VICTORIA

Must they always follow us?

BROWN

I ordered it.  It's for your own

safety.

VICTORIA

Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch

what I eat next.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

Am I not safe enough with you, John?

BROWN

Aye.

(looking away)

But there are Fenians reported on the

mainland.

VICTORIA

(tutting irritably)

The threat from the Irish is greatly

exaggerated, I'm sure.

BROWN

(snapping back)

I'll decide when it's exaggerated.

VICTORIA

Is anything the matter, John?

(beat)

John?

BROWN

Nothing's the matter.

BROWN

Hey, Barney.

BARNEY

Mr Brown, sir --

BROWN

It's cold out there tonight, Barney.

BROWN (CONT'D)

Yeah, there's a good girl.

(to Barney)

Have you had a look at this hoof?  She

was limping badly.  I think there

might be a stone in it.

BARNEY

Yeah, yeah, I did.

BROWN

Good man.  And is she all right?

BARNEY

Yeah.

BROWN

Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you?

Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you

know the Queen's riding tomorrow?

BARNEY

Yeah.

BROWN

(beat)

Are you all right, Barney?

BROWN (CONT'D)

Oh, aye...

VICTORIA

Well?

LADY ELY

Mr Brown is unable to attend today.

VICTORIA

Why?

LADY ELY

I believe he is unwell, ma'am.

VICTORIA

Unwell?

LADY ELY

I understand he was in a fight.

VICTORIA

Has he been hurt?

LADY ELY

I believe not, ma'am.  I understand --

he'd had rather too much to drink.

VICTORIA

You may go.

BROWN

And she sent no word down?

ARCHIE

They said you were drunk.

(beat)

Why don't you tell her the truth?

BROWN

She'll think it's her fault for

keeping me.

ARCHIE

What are you doing?!

BROWN

I'm getting dressed.

ARCHIE

You've got three broken ribs, man!

BROWN

I've got my duties to attend to.

ARCHIE

Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit

state to go anywhere.

BROWN

She'll be worried about me.

ARCHIE

She'll get over it.

BROWN

I can't let her down now, Archie.

ARCHIE

And when was the last time she put

herself out for you?  Look, John,

whatever she says to you now, in the

end you're still a servant.

BROWN

Oh, I'm much more than that.

ARCHIE

Aye, she may say that to you, but the

woman can say what she wants.

BROWN

You watch your tongue.

ARCHIE

Come on, man, I'm telling you what you

already know.

BROWN

You know nothing about her!

ARCHIE

When are you gonna see it, John?  She

doesn't give a damn about you.

BROWN

From the Queen!

BROWN (CONT'D)

My lips may give a message better of

Christmas love than e'en this letter.

(beat)

To my best friend, J.B. from his best

friend, V.R.

(he thrusts it in his

brother's face)

Best friend!

ARCHIE

Aye.

BROWN

She means it.

ARCHIE

She'll drop you.  When she's done with

you, she'll drop you.

BROWN

Get out.

(beat)

Out!

BROWN (CONT'D)

OUT!!

PONSONBY

... to be followed by a visit from

Lady Bridport.  She is keen to secure

a place for her niece as Maid of

Honor.

VICTORIA

I am tired.

PONSONBY

There is one other matter.

VICTORIA

What is it?

PONSONBY

I have a letter, ma'am.

VICTORIA

From whom?

PONSONBY

From Princess Helena and other members

of your family.

VICTORIA

(stiffening defensively)

My family is quite capable of

communicating with the Queen in

person.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

What do they want?

PONSONBY

They are demanding the dismissal of

John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.

DEAN WELLSELLY

You wished to see me, ma'am?

VICTORIA

My husband tried always to make me

think more subtly.  Of course he

taught me so much and I can never

repay my debt to him, or the love I

feel, even now.  But, in truth, I

think I am someone who can only feel

things while they are alive to me.

For that reason, I know I do not have

a subtle mind.  I know that.  But I

work hard and I try to do my duty.

(she hesitates; she is

struggling now)

However, I have noticed of late that

my feelings of grief are not so strong

and -- that I find myself leaning more

upon the comfort of living friends.

(beat)

Friends close to me now.

DEAN WELLSELLY

Your Majesty, a settled resignation is

more lasting proof of affection than

active grief.  If the good Lord sees

fit to bring one into contact with

congenial fellow beings, one should

not analyze one's reaction too deeply.

To allow oneself to be comforted by

someone else need not imply any

disloyalty to the memory of the loved

one.

VICTORIA

Sir Henry.

PONSONBY

Ma'am?

VICTORIA

Please tell the Princess, and other

signatories to this letter, that the

Queen will not be dictated to, or made

to alter, in any way, what she has

found to answer for her comfort.

(beat)

Do I make myself clear?

PONSONBY

Ma'am.

VICTORIA

You may go.

VICTORIA

I would like to get down.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

John?

BROWN

Yes, ma'am?

VICTORIA

I was told you were in a fight.

BROWN

Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA

Has someone seen to those bruises?

BROWN

Yes, ma'am.

BROWN (CONT'D)

Ma'am?

VICTORIA

Yes?

BROWN

Having considered my position here at

court, I have come to the conclusion

that it is in the best interest of

Your Majesty that I should resign.

VICTORIA

I do not accept.

BROWN

I had foreseen that you would not.

But Your Majesty should understand --

that my mind will not be changed in

this.  I leave for Deeside --

VICTORIA

(cutting in)

The Queen forbids it.

(beat)

I cannot allow it because I cannot

live without you.  Without you, I

cannot find the strength to be who I

must be.  Please.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

Promise me you won't let them send me

back.

BROWN

I promise.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

DISRAELI (V.O.)

Yesterday, Gladstone talked for three

hours on the Irish Church Bill ... I

am as guilty as the rest of

underestimating his reforming zeal.

Tory days may be numbered, but I fancy

there yet remains one last hope of

deliverance.  Wheresoever the blame

lies, we must now close ranks and

defend Mrs Brown's England.  As for my

interminable journey to the land of

Calvin, oatcakes and sulphur ...

DISRAELI (O.S.)

... no Prime Minister made greater

sacrifice than attempting to run the

country six hundred miles north of

civilization.

VICTORIA

How dare the Irish break with the

Anglicans?

If Albert were alive today he would

never allow the Crown to give up

Church patronage.  No, the Irish must

be told, very firmly, to stay exactly

where they are.  It is the thin edge

of the wedge, Mr Disraeli.  Next, you

will be telling me that the Crown no

longer governs this nation.

DISRAELI

Your Majesty remains at the very

epicenter of governance.  As for your

people, look no further than the sales

of your Highland Journals to see in

what affection the nation holds their

Queen.

(beat)

You sell even more copies than Mr

Dickens.

VICTORIA

But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.

DISRAELI

Of course I understand your concern.

You miss your people.

(a pause)

And they miss you.

VICTORIA

Then they may read about me.

DISRAELI

Indeed, and for that they are

eternally grateful.

VICTORIA

Is that not enough?

DISRAELI

In so many ways ... and yet it is your

presence they crave.  A figurehead.

VICTORIA

I never thought to be bullied by you,

Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought,

understood a widow's grief.

DISRAELI

Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for

the nation, only for myself.  As Prime

Minister I confess I miss your

presence, but that is only an

expression of my own selfish desires

and I should not burden you with it.

VICTORIA

I stay here because I am happy.

(beat)

Is that such a terrible crime?

DISRAELI

No, ma'am.

BROWN

Time for your walk.

VICTORIA

This is my good John Brown.

DISRAELI

(taking him in)

Yes.

VICTORIA

I have asked him to show you a little

of Highland life while you are with us

at Balmoral.

BROWN

What brings you here?

DISRAELI

A man can refuse only so many

invitations from his Queen.  It was

remiss of me not to come earlier.

BROWN

What do you know about the Highlands?

DISRAELI

I am a blank sheet.

BROWN

Do you hunt?

DISRAELI

Occasionally.

BROWN

Dare say you can be taught.

DISRAELI

To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.

BROWN

If you hunt, you kill.

DISRAELI

Well then, I'll do my best.

BROWN

(demonstrating with his

rifle)

Always remember, you keep it tight to

your shoulder, you absorb the kick.

Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's

Gladstone.

DISRAELI

(smiling)

Quite.

BROWN

(ticking as he goes)

... Back doors, West Wing.

UPPER SERVANT 1

Checked and locked, sir.

BROWN

Side doors, East Wing.

ASSISTANT DRESSER

Checked and locked, sir.

BROWN

Louder, girl!

ASSISTANT DRESSER

(creasing up)

Checked and locked, sir.

BROWN

Kitchen and lower house.

BERTIE'S VALET

Checked and locked, sir.

BROWN

Back and upper corridors.

UPPER SERVANT 2

Checked and locked, sir.

BROWN

Front door.

(beat)

Checked and locked.

BERTIE'S VALET

(with a smug smile)

Did you see any Irish assassins today,

Mr Brown?

BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)

We heard the dogs were Fenian

sympathizers.

BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)

Or was it the stag ...?

BROWN

There's not a soul here cares about

that wee woman's safety except me!

She'd die in a ditch if I wasn't there

to look out for her --

ARCHIE

What's this?

BROWN

It's a diary.

ARCHIE

Be careful who sees it.

BROWN

What do you take me for?

ARCHIE

You should have someone look after

you.

BROWN

I'm all right.  I just need to rest up

a wee bit.

(feeling everything spin)

The room ... You don't have to stay.

ARCHIE

The place is a mess.

BROWN

I can't move to tidy.

ARCHIE

It's what the maids are for.

BROWN

I'm not having some prattler going

through my things.

ARCHIE

Won't you give yourself a rest, John?

She's other people to look out for

her.

BROWN

She needs me, Archie.  She canna do

without me, she said it to my face.

(his hands come up to cover

his eyes)

How can I stop now?

BROWN

You sent for me.

DISRAELI

I've been called back to London.  My

last day.  I thought I might take a

walk on Lochnagar.

DISRAELI

Princes and Lords are but the breath

of kings, An honest man's the noblest

work of God.

(beat)

You must miss such magnificent views.

BROWN

I don't think about it.

DISRAELI

Forgive me, I've called you out and

you should have been resting.

BROWN

I'm fine.

DISRAELI

You're injured.

BROWN

It's nothing.

DISRAELI

Still, someone must attend you.  Your

wife should not have let you out.

BROWN

I'm not married.

DISRAELI

(deadpan)

Oh.

BROWN

This is the top.

DISRAELI

I confess, I sometimes feel as if I am

not married myself, I see my wife so

little.  But I'm forgetting the

rewards.

DISRAELI (CONT'D)

The look on their faces when one walks

into the room.  Still gives one a

ridiculous thrill.

BROWN

I wouldn't know.

DISRAELI

Surely --

BROWN

(interrupts)

What I do, I do for my Queen.

DISRAELI

Was there never ambition?

BROWN

(beat)

Maybe, once.

DISRAELI

Then I envy yo.

BROWN

Why?

DISRAELI

To have achieved one's ambition, or to

have reconciled oneself to its limits,

is a lifetime's work.

BROWN

I do what I do.

DISRAELI

For Her Majesty.

BROWN

Aye.

DISRAELI

But yourself?

(beat)

What about John Brown?

BROWN

I said.

(beat)

I serve the Queen.

DISRAELI

No other aspiration?

BROWN

To see her safe.

DISRAELI

You will not be unaware of the threat

now posed by Republicanism.

BROWN

Why do you think I keep her here?

DISRAELI

Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It

is her very isolation that encourages

the malcontents.  The longer she is

away, the stronger they become; and

who, honestly, can promise security

against that?  However many doors you

lock, someone will always get in.

Even here.

BROWN

So...?

DISRAELI

The truth is, the Queen would be safer

doing her duty and returning south to

her public.  John Bull loves her and

John Bull is her best defense.

BROWN

Her mind is set.  She won't change

now.

DISRAELI

She trusts you, John.

BROWN

They don't see it.

DISRAELI

See what?

BROWN

The threat.

(beat)

I tell them, but they don't see it.

DISRAELI

They aren't as watchful as you.

BROWN

Too busy looking after themselves.

DISRAELI

The greasy pole.

BROWN

No loyalty.

DISRAELI

No love.

BROWN

I promised to protect her from people

like you.

DISRAELI

For once in my life, I am not the

issue.

BROWN

She'll never understand it.

DISRAELI

In time, she will.

BROWN

She'll think I betrayed her.

DISRAELI

But others will know that you acted

for the greater good.

VICTORIA

I received a letter today from Mr

Disraeli.  Parliament is calling for

my return to public duties.

(beat)

Why won't they let us be?

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

He insists that the country expects me

to preside over the opening of the new

session.  I refuse to offer sustenance

to enable his weakening grip.

Besides, you know how much I should

hate it.  It frightens me.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

John?

BROWN

We can't always have what we wish.

VICTORIA

Duty?!  You talk about duty?!

BROWN

If duty and safety are served by the

same end then, aye, I do.

VICTORIA

I cannot believe you are saying this?

You, who I have relied on all this

time --

BROWN

(cutting in)

Have I ever let you down before--?

VICTORIA

(as if he had not spoken)

-- You stand there and tell me it is

my duty ... after all you promised me!

BROWN

I'm breaking no promises!

VICTORIA

You are forcing me to do the very

thing you know I fear most!

BROWN

For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying

to keep you safe!

VICTORIA

I will not hear any more about my

safety!!  You made me a promise and

now you have broken it!

BROWN

-- When I took you out riding, come

rain or shine, because I knew it was

right for you, when I kept the bairns

off your back so you could have a bit

of peace, when I saw you safe from

home to home and you didn't even know

I was there...!  All I've ever thought

about is you!

VICTORIA

Then why send me back to them?!

BROWN

Because I have to!

(pause

Will you no listen to me, woman?

VICTORIA

Do not presume to talk to your Queen

in that manner.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

Doctor Jenner, I feel unwell.  I shall

retire to my chamber.  Please attend

me presently.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

PONSONBY

May I say, how glad I am to see Your

Majesty so much recovered.

VICTORIA

Where is my son?

PRINCESS ALEXANDRA

Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.

VICTORIA

Why is he not here?

PRINCESS ALEXANDRA

He is sick, ma'am.

VICTORIA

Then why are you not with him?

PRINCESS ALEXANDRA

You ordered all members of the Royal

Family to attend you at Balmoral.

VICTORIA

What is the matter with him?

PRINCESS ALEXANDRA

He has typhoid fever, ma'am.

VICTORIA

No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert,

my husband, had typhoid fever.  I

asked what was wrong with my son.

JENNER

The same, your Majesty.

VICTORIA

Why was I not informed?

JENNER

I did not consider it wise, in the

circumstances, to tax your nerves.

VICTORIA

How ill is he?

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

(to Alexandra)

Alex?

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

He is not well, ma'am.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

I must go to him.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

We must leave at once.

JENNER

Better.

VICTORIA

Should the good Lord see fit to spare

my son, I will order a mass to be

celebrated at St. George's.  The

people must share with their Queen,

her prayers and hopes for their future

King.

PONSONBY

(aside to BROWN)

The Queen will be riding to St.

George's on the fifth.

BROWN

(launching straight in)

I recommend Her Majesty uses the

covered carriage with a full Horse

Guard.  In the event of any

disturbance I will ensure --

VICTORIA

(cutting in)

I will ride to St. George's in an open

carriage.  It is time the Queen was

seen by her public.

DEAN WELLSELLY (O.S.)

... praise and magnify thy glorious

name for that thou has raised thy

servant Albert Edward, Prince of Wales

from the bed of sickness.

We pray thee to perfect the recovery

of thy servant and to crown him day by

day with more abundant blessings both

for body and soul, through Jesus

Christ our Lord ...

CONGREGATION (O.S.)

Amen.

BROWN

NO!!

BERTIE (O.S.)

So there he is, Arthur O'Conner...

BERTIE

(bristling with confidence)

... all seven stone of the man,

paddling madly towards us through a

sea of Horse Guards, waving something

that looks vaguely like a pen.  I

thought he must be one of the mother's

ardent readership in search of the

Royal indenture...

BERTIE (CONT'D)

I believe I saw him first and then

alerted Brown.  I'm not convinced that

he wasn't taking a snooze on top of

the box.  Anyway, we had our man

pinned down and I must say, Brown

acquitted himself admirably.  Of

course the gun was a fake, but all the

same, it was well done.

VICTORIA

I intend Brown to be rewarded with a

special medal cast in gold.  It will

be called The Devoted Service Medal.

BERTIE

A toast.  Victoria Regina!

EVERYONE

Victoria Regina!

DISRAELI (O.S.)

The people of England have expressed

in a manner which cannot be mistaken,

that they will uphold the ancient

monarchy of England ...

DISRAELI

... If the first great object of the

Tory Party is to maintain the

institutions of the country, the

second is, in my opinion, to maintain

the Empire of England ... the

hereditary, the traditionary policy of

the Tory Party.  Go to your homes,

teach them these truths, which will

soon be imprinted on the conscience of

the land ...

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

BROWN (V.O.)

We should not live in expectation of

contentment.  Fifteen years of

vigilance will not guarantee peace of

mind.  Yesterday, intruders were again

reported in the South Wing.  I believe

my prompt arrival may have averted any

crisis, but it was a timely reminder.

It is a great comfort to me that my

efforts in securing the Queen's safety

over the years have not been in vain.

Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word

that she's dissatisfied.  And I feel

sure that if she were unhappy she

would have found the occasion  to

speak to me in person, as she has so

often done in the past.

BROWN (CONT'D)

What is it?

PAGE

North woods, sir.

BROWN

God save the Queen!!

VICTORIA

(quietly)

How long has he been this sick?

LADY ELY

A few days, ma'am.

VICTORIA

Why was I not told earlier?

VICTORIA

You should never have gone out in such

foul weather.

BROWN

Someone has to look after you.

(pause)

It could've been someone.  It was

before.

VICTORIA

Yes.  Yes it was.

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

My Ministers are as impertinent as

ever.  Dispatches are now so numerous,

they come in a trunk.  Sometimes I do

believe they will never stop.  Endless

letters...

VICTORIA (CONT'D)

I know I have not always been the

loyal friend you deserved, John.  And

yet here I am now, even now, feeling

desperate at the thought of losing

you.

BROWN

Don't be silly, woman.

BROWN (CONT'D)

Not too near.

JENNER

Erysipelas.

PONSONBY

Not too protracted, I hope.

JENNER

(shakes his head)

A few days...

(beat)

When he heard, the Prince of Wales

threw the bust from the window of the

Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to

gather the fragments.

PONSONBY

The Queen wishes to publish an account

of him.

JENNER

Dear oh dear.

PONSONBY

We think she can be dissuaded.

(beat)

Have you had a glance at the diary?

JENNER

Yes.

PONSONBY

Quite.

(beat)

I think I'd best take it back.

JENNER

Of course.

JENNER (CONT'D)

Where did you find it by the way?

PONSONBY

Some young page was boasting about

having seen it.

(beat)

Lucky.

JENNER

Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.

PONSONBY

No, indeed.
