"KRAMER VS. KRAMER"

by

Robert Benton

TED

(predicting the worst)

They're not gonna call... I tell you

they're not gonna call. I blew it. I

don't know what I did wrong, but I

O'CONNOR

(not unfriendly)

Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's

not about to drop an account that

represents more than two million in

gross billing receipts in a small

agency like this, without making us

sweat. Now just relax, okay?

Everything's gonna be fine.

TED

(at this stage, nothing

will help)

I don't think so, Jim. Maybe I

shouldn't have

CUT TO:

JOANNA

(intense)

I love you, Billy...

BILLY

(drowsy)

I love you too, mommy... Good-night...

JOANNA

Sleep tight...

BILLY

Don't let the bedbugs bite...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

O'CONNOR

Here's to Ted Kramer.

O'CONNOR

(putting an arm around

Ted squeezing him

tight)

I wanna tell you something about

this little runt. He went out there

and sold the shit out of Revlon and

that's why we got the account. It

was his idea, it was his concept,

right down the line...

TED

(embarrassed, but

cannot stop grinning)

All I can say... All I can say is

this is maybe one of the five best

days of my whole life...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TED

(in the middle of a

story)

So anyway Jim and I are making the

pitch, right? And all of a sudden

this old guy starts to cough and I

keep on going and he keeps on coughing

and I keep on going and he keeps on

coughing and

MURRAY

(interrupting)

Congratulations, Ted. That was a

hell of a job.

TED

(surprised)

Where you goin' Murray, it's early?

MURRAY

Got to get home.

TED

(glancing at his watch)

Oh, Christ, I'm late... I gotta get

out of here.

(however, instead of

going, he settles

back and resumes his

story)

So anyway, I look over and this old

geezer is starting to turn blue and

I swear to God the only thing I can

think about is that this poor

sonofabitch is gonna die on me and

screw up the pitch.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

O'CONNOR

Hey, what's the rush? C'mon, walk me

a couple of blocks.

TED

Jim, I've got to go. I'm already

late

O'CONNOR

Listen, Ted... I just want to tell

you, when old man Schmidt retires

next year, I've got a pretty good

feeling they'll kick me upstairs...

O'CONNOR

...and when they do, I just want you

to know I'm takin' you along with

me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

O'CONNOR

(feeling no pain)

Y'know, Ted, I mean what I said back

there. You did a hell of a job on

this and I want you to know I'm

turning the whole show over to you.

TED

(thrilled)

Wow!

O'CONNOR

I mean it Ted, you're running this

one.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TED

I thought you might just like to

know that at five-fifteen this

afternoon we were officially handed

the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.

JOANNA

(she takes a deep

breath, then:)

Ted, I'm leaving you.

TED

That represents a gross billing in

excess of two million

(hearing her)

What?!

JOANNA

Here are my keys. I won't be needing

them any more.

TED

(sardonic)

I'm sorry I'm late, all right? I'm

sorry I didn't call  I was busy

making a living.

JOANNA

My American Express... My

Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My

check book

TED

(the martyr)

Okay, okay... What is it this time?

What did I do now?...

JOANNA

(ignoring this)

I took two thousand out of the savings

account. That was what I had in the

bank when we got married.

TED

Joanna, whatever it is, believe me,

I'm sorry.

JOANNA

Here are the slips for the laundry

and the cleaning. They'll be ready

on Saturday.

TED

(hard lining it)

Now listen, before you do something

you'll really regret you'd better

stop and think -

JOANNA

(not bothering to

look up)

I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and

the phone bill, so you don't have to

worry about them.

JOANNA

There, that's everything.

TED

(panic starting)

For God's sake, Joanna, would you at

least tell me what I did that's so

terrible! Would you do me that little

favor?

JOANNA

Look, it's not your fault, okay?

It's me. It's my fault  you just

married the wrong person.

TED

(placating her)

So we've got problems. Everybody's

got problems  that's normal

JOANNA

Ted, you're not listening to me.

It's over, finished.

TED

I'm listening, Joanna  believe me,

I'm listening. My wife is walking

out on me after eight years of

JOANNA

(bitter)

You just don't get it, do you?

(as though to a child)

I  am  really  and  truly

leaving  you.

TED

I heard you, Joanna. I promise I

heard you.

JOANNA

No you didn't.

(quietly)

You didn't even ask about Billy.

TED

(stiffening)

What about Billy?

JOANNA

I'm not taking him with me.

TED

What?

JOANNA

(tears start)

Ted, I can't... I tried... I really

tried but... I just can't hack it

anymore...

TED

C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.

You're a terrific mother

JOANNA

(from her gut)

I am not! I'm a terrible mother! I'm

an awful mother. I yell at him all

the time. I have no patience. No...

No. He's better off without me.

(unable to look at

Ted)

Ted, I've got to go... I've got to

go.

TED

(desperate)

Okay, I understand and I promise I

won't try and stop you, but you can't

just go... Look, come inside and

talk... Just for a few minutes.

JOANNA

(pleading)

NO!... Please... Please don't make

me stay... I swear... If you do,

sooner or later... maybe tomorrow,

maybe next week... maybe a year from

now...

(looking directly at

him)

I'll go right out the window.

TED

(quiet)

Where are you going?

JOANNA

I don't know...

TED

Do you want me to help you get a

cab?

TED

(calling out)

Joanna!?... Joanna?!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOMAN'S VOICE

(obviously asleep)

Huh... Hello?

TED

(righteous)

All right, Thelma... That's it. I've

had it. You can call your good friend

Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is

enough, okay? I mean, I don't know

what I did, but you can tell her

she's made her point.

WOMAN'S VOICE

Ted, what are you talking about?!

TED

Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.

You know perfectly well what's going

on.

WOMAN'S VOICE

(exasperated)

Ted, I don't understand a word you're

saying. Where's Joanna?

TED

Ha! You tell me.

CUT TO:

THELMA

(looking around,

suspiciously)

All right. What's going on?

TED

All right, Thelma, you want to know

what's going on? I'll tell you what's

going on. I'll tell you exactly what's

going on.

THELMA

Look, Ted, all I

TED

(starting to really

roll)

I came home tonight. We just got the

Fire and Ice account at the agency.

Do you know what that means?! Do you

understand what that means? It means

that it was maybe one of the five

best days in my whole life.

THELMA

Ted, all I wanted to know was where

TED

(not letting her get

a word in edgewise)

I walk in the house and before I can

say "How are you?", "Did you have a

nice day?" before I can say anything.

Pow she's out the door.

THELMA

OhmyGod. Didn't she say anything?

She must've said something.

TED

(sarcastic)

Yeah, she said it wasn't any use

talking anymore.

THELMA

Ted, don't be so hostile.

TED

Hostile?

(pow)

Me?

(whack)

Thelma, I'm not hostile.

(thud)

I am anything but hostile.

(sock)

But if you want to know what I am.

I'll tell you what I am. What I am

is, I am hurt. I am very hurt. And I

just want to know one thing, okay?

Just one thing... Why? That's all I

want to know... Why?

THELMA

(how to say this)

Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot

and... well, she told me a lot of...

ah, things about the two of you.

TED

(instantly nervous)

Things? What kind of things?

THELMA

(clearly she knows

more than she's

willing to say)

I mean... things. Ted, Joanna's very

unhappy and

TED

(flash of anger)

Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn

good life. She's got a husband that

loves her. She's got a terrific kid.

She's got a wonderful home

THELMA

(getting mad herself)

What d'you know about how Joanna

felt? You went off to an office every

morning and you'd come dragging home

at seven or eight every night and as

long as dinner was on the table you

thought everything was swell.

TED

Did it ever occur to you guys that

Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person

in the world to live with?! Did it?!

For one thing she's always thirty

minutes late. You can set your watch

by it

THELMA

(exasperated)

So she's late. What's the big deal.

That's just a way of saying, "Pay

attention to me."

TED

(not listening)

Two. She is getting to be a real

hermit or recluse or whatever it is

you call it. Thelma, do you know

where I could be in this business if

I had a wife that entertained or

went out socially

THELMA

Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the

most selfish human being I have ever

met. No wonder she said you came

first, then Billy, then, if there

was anything left over, she got the

scraps.

TED

Joanna said that?

TED

Then how come she never said anything

like that to me?

THELMA

Maybe she didn't feel like she should

have to. Maybe she felt like if you'd

been paying any real attention to

her to start with, maybe you would've

noticed.

TED

(stung)

Boy, you guys are really something,

y'know? I'd like to know one thing,

okay  just one little thing. Did

you tell Joanna she should leave me?

THELMA

(stiffly)

No.

TED

Y'know something Thelma  you are

the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean

it. Joanna and I never had any trouble

until you and Charley split up.

THELMA

Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I

know, I went through it. You've got

to believe I did everything I could

to get Joanna to stay.

(pause)

But I'll tell you something. You may

not want to hear it, but it took a

lot of courage for Joanna to do what

she just did.

TED

I'd like to know what the hell kind

of courage it takes to walk out on

your husband and your child?

THELMA

Joanna left Billy? She didn't take

him with her?

THELMA

(stunned, quiet)

Oh Shit.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BILLY

Where's mommy?

TED

Huh?... Oh God... What time is it?

BILLY

(suspicious)

The little hand is on the six and

the big hand is on the nine. Where

is mommy?

TED

(trying to pull himself

together)

Oh, Christ... Ah, yeah... you want

to know why mom's not here, right?

TED

(bullshit)

Okay, I'm going to tell you... It's

like this. Mommy and daddy had a

little argument and mommy decided

she wanted to go off by herself for

a little while. You know how sometimes

you get mad and want to go off and

be by yourself? Well, it's like that,

okay? Okay.

(subject closed)

Now how about some breakfast?

BILLY

When is mommy coming back?

TED

(lying)

Soon. Very soon.

TED

(the camp counselor)

I'll tell you what, kiddo  why don't

I fix us some French toast?

BILLY

(impressed)

Wow! French toast, really?

TED

(the camp counselor)

Sure. Didn't I ever tell you French

toast was my specialty? I'll bet I

never told you that. Now then, the

first thing we need is...

(trying desperately

to remember)

...eggs! Right?

TED

This is terrific... isn't this

terrific?

TED

(saying it will make

it so)

I'm having a good time... Are you

having a good time?

BILLY

You forgot the milk.

TED

(still the camp

counselor)

That's right. You're absolutely

right... It's been a long time since

I made French toast.

TED

Look at this, isn't this something?!

BILLY

What about my orange juice?

TED

(the counterman)

Right. One O.J. coming up.

BILLY

(scared)

Daddy!!!

TED

Don't worry... Everything's fine...

TED

Goddam! Son of a bitch!

TED

(to himself as much

as to Billy)

It's okay. It's gonna be okay...

CUT TO:

BILLY

When is mommy coming back?

TED

Soon. I told you before, very soon.

BILLY

(nervous)

Will she pick me up after school?

TED

No. If I'm not here, you go home

with Thelma and Kim.

BILLY

What if she forgets?

TED

(weary)

I'll call Thelma and remind her,

okay? Don't worry.

BILLY

But what happens if she's on her way

to school and she gets runned over

by a truck and killed? What happens

them?

CUT TO:

RECEPTIONIST

(cheerful)

Congratulations, Mr. Kramer.

YOUNG MAN

Terrific news, Ted.

O'CONNOR

Hey... Look who was out celebrating

last night.

TED

(trying to appear

nonchalant)

Uh, Jim... Can I talk to you?

CUT TO:

O'CONNOR

Jesus Christ. That's a real

blockbuster.

(shakes his head)

I always figured you guys had it

made.

TED

(morose)

You want to know the real kicker?

The real kicker is, for the first

time in my life  the first time  I

feel like a loser.

O'CONNOR

(stiff upper lip)

Listen, don't let it get you down.

(doesn't believe it

for a second)

You're going to be fine.

TED

(toujour gai)

Me? I've never been better. I mean

having my wife walk out on me after

seven years of marriage agrees with

me just fine.

O'CONNOR

Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on

the beat, okay? Three marriages, two

divorces... You're gonna be okay.

TED

(wishful thinking)

I'm going to be okay. The way I see

it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a

matter of time.

O'CONNOR

(emphatically)

She'll be back...

O'CONNOR

(trying to be tactful)

But... just in case... I mean, just

on the off chance she doesn't. What

are you going to do about the kid?

TED

(the wind goes out of

him)

I don't know, Jim. This whole thing

has happened so... Pow  like that.

O'CONNOR

(a friend having to

say something very

difficult)

Look, it's none of my business, so

you can tell me to butt out, okay?

But if you want my advice, you'll

send Billy away to stay with relatives

for a while. Just until you get

yourself straightened out.

TED

(doubtfully)

I don't know, Jim...

O'CONNOR

(the Dutch uncle)

Ted, this may sound a little rough,

but we've just landed the biggest

account in the history of this agency,

right? And now it's up to us  that's

you and me  to deliver the goods.

Ted, you're my main man, and if I

can't depend on you a hundred and

ten percent, twenty-four hours a

day, because you're worried about a

kid with a runny nose

TED

Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.

I mean it, but I really think Joanna's

coming back.

O'CONNOR

I hope you're right, Ted... I really

hope you're right.

CUT TO:

TED

Billy!

BILLY

(focused on T.V.)

Uh, huh...

TED

You got a letter from mom.

BILLY

(excited)

When is she coming home?!

TED

"My dear, sweet Billy: Mommy has

gone away. Sometimes in the world

daddies go away and mommies bring up

their little boys. But sometimes a

mommy can go away too, and you have

your daddy to bring you up."

TED

(raising his voice so

he can be heard)

"I have gone away because I must

find some interesting things to do

for myself in the world. Everybody

has to, and so do I. Being your mommy

was one thing, but there are other

things and this is what I have to

do. I did not get a chance to tell

you this, and that is why I am writing

you now."

TED

"I will always be your mommy and I

will always love you. I just won't

be your mommy in the house. But I

will be your mommy of the heart. And

I... "

(he looks up, about

to tell the child to

lower the volume)

Billy.

TED

(as he reaches across,

turns down the sound

on the T.V.)

It's okay... It's okay. We'll talk

about it some other time.

CUT TO:

THELMA

Oh, God... OhmyGod...

THELMA

What are you going to do?

TED

I don't know, Thel... This whole

thing has happened so... Pow, like

that.

THELMA

I mean, what are you going to do

about Billy?

TED

(stiff)

I'm gonna keep him, why?

THELMA

Look, this is nothing personal, but

I don't think you can do it.

TED

Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not

losing my child.

THELMA

(backing off)

All right... Okay... But let's get

something straight, right now. I

mean, I'm sorry about what happened

between you and Joanna, but it's not

my problem, understand?

THELMA

I'm not going to have you calling

every fifteen minutes just because

you can't find a hot water bottle,

understand?

THELMA

I've got enough trouble raising my

own kid. I don't need another one.

Got it?

TED

Got it.

THELMA

You're on your own, understand?

TED

I understand.

THELMA

You're sure?

TED

I'm sure.

THELMA

All right. Who's Billy's pediatrician?

THELMA

(machine-gun delivery)

Ed Davies. 230 East 76th Street. 472-

8227. Fifty bucks a house call, thirty

for an office visit. Write this down:

I'm not telling you twice. What's

the nearest hospital?

TED

Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

THELMA

(not waiting)

Lenox Hill. 77th Street between Park

and Lex. The emergency number is 327-

0800.

TED

Slow down... Slow down...

(jovial)

What's the big rush. C'mon in, put

your feet up, have a drink.

TED

Can't do it tonight. Gotta pick up

Billy. I'm late.

O'CONNOR

(paying no attention

to that)

Listen, I heard a terrific joke today.

There's this Polish skydiver

Mrs. Kline, I'm sorry I'm late, but

MRS. KLINE

That's all right, but I'm afraid

Billy was a little nervous...

BILLY

(to Ted, accusingly)

You're late.

TED

I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting

and

BILLY

(to Mrs. Kline anxious

to get away)

Goodbye.

MRS. KLINE

Goodbye, Bill. Thank you for coming.

(calling out to her

son in the next room)

Mark. Say goodbye to Bill.

MARK (O.S.)

(preoccupied)

Bye.

BILLY

Bye.

BILLY

(sullen)

I was waiting a long time.

TED

(this ain't exactly

the greeting he's

expected)

It wasn't so long, I'm only...

(checking his watch)

...twenty minutes late.

BILLY

All the other mothers got here a

long time ago...

CUT TO:

TED

(more of the camp

counselor)

How was school today?

BILLY

Okay... Same as usual...

TED

Billy, don't eat with your fingers.

BILLY

(morose)

Sorry.

TED

(like pulling teeth)

Well, I see the Yankees finally won

a game.

BILLY

Mom, I mean dad?

TED

Yeah?

BILLY

Can I be excused? I'm not hungry. I

think I'll go to bed.

TED

Sure. Too much birthday cake, right?

BILLY

(as he gets up from

the table)

I guess...

TED

Goodnight.

BILLY

(aloof)

'Night.

TED

Listen, pal, I'm sorry, okay?

TED

I know how you feel.

TED

Look, I remember one time when. I

was a couple of years younger than

you are now and... I was staying

with this cousin of mine and my

parents were supposed to come and

pick me up by three, but it got later

and later and they didn't and they

didn't show up and I remember I got

really scared that something had

happened to them and I remember when

they finally came instead of being

happy to see them I was very angry

and... Billy, I promise I'll never

do that to you again, okay?...

TED

Billy? Okay?

WOMAN

(looking around nervous)

It's very big... They didn't tell me

it was this big.

TED

(apologetically)

No... No, actually it's only two

bedrooms.

SECOND WOMAN

(sniffing)

Phew... This place is a real pig

sty.

TED

(defensively)

Look, my wife just walked out on me.

Okay? It's been a tough week.

THIRD WOMAN

Don't tell me your troubles, mister.

I got enough of my own.

FOURTH WOMAN

The first thing is, I don't do floors.

FOURTH WOMAN

Or windows. I come in at ten and I

get Wednesdays off.

You couldn't make that Saturday,

could you?

CUT TO:

MRS. WILLEWSKA

What kind of boy is your son?

TED

(taken aback)

Well, he's... ah, he's a good kid.

He's shy and... I think he's probably

very creative and...

MRS. WILLEWSKA

Could I see him?

TED

Sure. He's right in here.

CUT TO:

MRS. WILLEWSKA

Oh... He's very beautiful.

MRS. WILLEWSKA (O.S.)

Mr. Kramer, you are a very lucky

man.

TED

Mrs. Willewska, could you start on

Monday?

CUT TO:

BILLY

(worried)

Mom, I mean dad...

TED

(his mind elsewhere)

Uh huh...

BILLY

That's not the right soap. We use

the kind in the green and yellow

box.

TED

C'mon, there's not much difference

BILLY

(firmly)

We use the green and yellow.

BILLY

(shaking his head

again)

The pink stuff.

TED

Okay, what color cereal do we get?

CUT TO:

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain

and buy him an ice.

TED

(looking in the

direction of the

voice)

What?

SATURDAY FATHER

Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain,

buy him an ice. It'll kill twenty

minutes.

TED

I've got a lot more than twenty

minutes to kill.

SATURDAY FATHER

Tough...

(checking his watch)

...I get off duty at five-thirty.

(bored, anxious to

make conversation)

How long you been divorced?

TED

(surprised)

Three months. How can you tell?

SATURDAY FATHER

You've got that look. My lady and I

split two years ago in August and

I'm an old pro at this shit. First

thing, stay away from the Children's

Zoo. It's pure hell  if I never see

another chicken, I'll be happy.

(calling out to his

daughter OFF SCREEN)

I'm here, darling. Don't worry...

Mr. Kramer, I just wanted to tell

you what a wonderful boy your son

is.

TED

her)

I don't know... I've been worried...

(glancing around,

making sure Billy is

out of earshot)

I mean, with what he's been through

and everything. I

TEACHER

(solicitously)

No... No... Billy is doing just fine.

TED

points)

Well, you know it's not easy raising

a kid on your own and I thought if

we could get together and, uh, discuss

Barbara! Congratulations! When is

Oh, God. Not 'til August.

Mr. O'Connor called. There's a meeting

I know... I know.

SECRETARY

Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures

on the television buy until Monday.

TED

No. Uh, uh. Tell him I asked for it

Friday. I want it Friday. Period.

SECRETARY

Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to

meet on Friday.

TED

Fine.

And Mrs. Kelsey called to ask if

Billy can come to Stephanie's birthday

party on Tuesday.

CUT TO:

TED

(as he enters)

Yes. Remind me to pick up a "Crying

Chrissie" doll at lunch on Tuesday.

O'CONNOR

(sardonic)

If it's all right with you, Mother

Kramer, can we get down to work now?

CUT TO:

PHYLLIS

Hello, Kramer.

TED

Hiya, Phyllis. These are the Revlon

contracts. I thought you ought to

check them out.

PHYLLIS

Sure.

PHYLLIS

Yes.

TED

(baffled)

Yes, what?

PHYLLIS

(looks up, serious)

Yes, I'll have dinner with you.

CUT TO:

PHYLLIS

Kramer, I've got to go. I've got an

eight o'clock closing tomorrow down

on Centre Street.

TED

(half asleep)

Mmmmnph... I'll get you a cab...

PHYLLIS

(as she crosses the

hall on the way to

the bathroom)

That's okay. It's just that I've got

these clients that are

CUT TO:

PHYLLIS

(softly to herself)

Oh, God.

BILLY

(very serious)

Do you like fried chicken?

PHYLLIS

(hoping desperately

it is the right answer)

Ah... Yes.

BILLY

So do I...

CUT TO:

PHYLLIS

(eyes wide)

I just met your son.

TED

Like that?!

TED

And?

PHYLLIS

He wanted to know if I liked fried

chicken.

TED

Do you?

TED

(grinning)

So what's your problem?

CUT TO:

TED

You ever think about getting married

again?

THELMA

No, not really...

(she thinks for a

moment, then:)

I guess it's different if you don't

have children, but... I dunno, even

if Charley and I don't live together,

even if we're sleeping with other

people, even if Charley was to marry

again... He'd still be my husband.

That stuff about "Till death do you

part?" That's really true.

TED

(nodding toward a

cookbook that is

propped open nearby)

How many onions does it say to use?

THELMA

(without bothering to

look in the book)

Three. And add some basil.

TED

(as he does)

D'you think you and Charley'll ever

get back together again?

THELMA

No. I don't think so.

TED

C'mon, Thel. So Charley had a little

fling. So what? All in all he was a

pretty good husband.

THELMA

Look, I know this isn't gonna make

any sense, okay? I mean forget the

logic part... But I keep thinking if

Charley really loved me, he wouldn't

have let me divorce him.

CUT TO:

TED

Now look, you hold it like this...

(he places Billy's

hands on the bat

just so)

...and you swing like this...

(taking him through

the motions)

PHYLLIS

(impatient)

No, no, no, Kramer. That's not how

you do it. Look...

PHYLLIS

...you hold it like this...

(showing him her grip)

Farther down the bat. And you swing

like this...

(to Ted)

Throw me one.

CUT TO:

TED

Okay, Jim. Here's the report on...

TED

(surprised)

What the hell is this?

O'CONNOR

(innocent)

Murray had some ideas about the Fire

and Ice campaign and he had the art

department make up a few roughs...

(weakly)

I think they're kind of interesting.

TED

(bugged)

I don't. Jim, this isn't anything

like what we talked about. It's not

even close.

MURRAY

(oily)

Ted, basically it's still your

concept.

O'CONNOR

(chiming in)

Murray just added a few things, that's

all.

TED

Now hold it right there, I'm the one

that went in and sold Revlon on this

idea to start with, remember? You

said I was going to be

O'CONNOR

Yeah?

O'CONNOR

It's for you.

TED

(puzzled)

Yes?

TED

Look, Billy, I told you before, one

hour of T.V. a day, that's the rule...

No...

(clearly, Billy is

giving him an argument)

I don't care what the other mothers

do... Listen, I can't talk now, I'm

in a meeting...

(firm)

Billy, I'll talk to you later, good-

bye.

MURRAY

(smooth)

Ted, I appreciate what you're saying,

but I really think you're just too

close to it right now.

O'CONNOR

(quickly)

Murray's right.

(reassuring)

Look it's just some ideas, okay? I

mean nothing's locked in cement. I

promise you this is your show...

O'CONNOR

Trust me on this one, Ted...

CUT TO:

BILLY

(worried about

something)

Mom, I mean dad...

TED

(busy)

In a minute...

BILLY

What do you do when an elephant sits

on your fence?

BILLY

You get a new fence.

TED

(he hasn't heard a

word)

C'mon, Billy. I'm trying to work for

God's sake...

TED

Goddamnit, can't you watch what you're

doing!

BILLY

(quiet)

I'm sorry.

TED

Je-sus Christ! I catch all kind of

shit at the office because I'm not

pulling my weight because I'm busting

my butt trying to be a decent goddamn

father and

BILLY

I'm sorry.

TED

(sardonic)

That's terrific. That's really

terrific, but I notice I'm the one

that's cleaning up this

(noticing an important

paper covered with

grape juice)

Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one

over.

BILLY

(starting to help)

I'm sorry.

TED

Look, it's after your bedtime, okay?

Just do me a favor and go to bed,

okay?

TED

Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?

BILLY

(quiet)

That's okay.

TED

It's just... I've been catching a

lot of flack at the office...

BILLY

That's okay...

PHYLLIS

How about lunch, Kramer. I'm buying.

CUT TO:

WAITER

Perrier and lime...

(placing a drink in

front of Phyllis)

...and scotch with soda.

(putting Ted's drink

in front of him)

TED

Okay, Phyllis, what's up?

PHYLLIS

Kramer...

PHYLLIS

(in a rush)

O'Connor's out to get you. He's going

to take the Fire and Ice account

away from you.

TED

(stunned)

What?!?

TED

(angry)

I don't believe it! That's crazy!

Why would Jim do something like that?

PHYLLIS

(angry herself)

You want to know why? I'll tell you

why...

(signaling to the

waiter)

Another scotch and soda for the

gentleman.

(back to Ted)

I'll tell you exactly why. Because

you're not his buddy anymore. Because

he can't count on you to sit around

the office every night until eight

or nine and shoot the shit with him.

TED

I can't. I've got Billy to take care

of.

PHYLLIS

(exasperated)

You dope. O'Connor doesn't give a

damn about Billy. All he wants is

somebody that'll hang around with

him every night so he won't have to

go home.

TED

(stiff)

I don't believe you.

PHYLLIS

(taking a stiff drink)

All right. Okay. But tell me

something, Kramer. Who do you think

is palling around with O'Connor these

days?

TED

How should I know?

PHYLLIS

Murray.

TED

So... what's so terrible about that?

PHYLLIS

(would like to take

him by the shoulders

and shake him until

his teeth rattle)

Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have

got to be the world's most naive

human being.

(leaning forward)

Murray has gone in and changed every

single ad you've done on the entire

Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...

Every idea... Every single thing,

right down the line.

TED

No. No, I don't believe it. Jim

O'Connor would never let anything

like that happen. He gave me my shot

in this business. If it wasn't for

Jim O'Connor I'd be  I don't know

where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...

PHYLLIS

(apologetic for having

upset Ted)

Kramer, I'm sorry. All I was trying

to do was

TED

(cutting her off)

I don't want to hear another word

against him. Not another word. He's

a wonderful man... a wonderful man...

CUT TO:

SECRETARY

(as Ted brushes past

her)

I'm sorry, Mr. O'Connor is in

conference.

CUT TO:

TED

(furious)

All right, Jim. You said I was running

this show, right? You said no

decisions without my approval, right?

(brandishing the ad)

Well what the hell is this? What's

going on, Jim?

O'CONNOR

(embarrassed)

Well, ah... I thought it over and I

decided we're doing it Murray's way.

TED

Jim, this is garbage. This isn't

anything like what we talked to Revlon

about. None of it. You can't

O'CONNOR

(tough)

That's my decision, Ted and that's

final.

CUT TO:

BILLY

What is it?

TED

Salisbury steak.

BILLY

I hate it.

TED

You don't hate it. We had Salisbury

steak last week and you liked it

fine.

BILLY

(stubborn)

No I didn't. I hate the brown stuff.

It's gross.

TED

(strained patience)

All it is is onions and gravy.

BILLY

I'm allergic to onions.

TED

You are not allergic of onions. You've

had them lots of times.

BILLY

(sullen)

I want a pizza.

TED

(trying not to lose

patience)

No. This is fine. Just take a bite,

you'll like it fine.

BILLY

I think I'm going to throw up.

TED

(getting pissed off)

Oh, for God's sake... Here.

TED

There, okay? Now that's just plain

old hamburger.

BILLY

Some of the brown stuff is still

there.

TED

(through clenched

teeth)

Then eat around it.

BILLY

No.

TED

(anger building)

Now listen to me, young man. Do you

know what I had to go through to put

this goddamn food on the goddamn

table?

BILLY

(obstinate)

I don't care. I hate it. I want pizza.

TED

(blowing up)

Not on your life. That's it. I've

had it with crap around this house.

From now on, no more pizza! Get it?

Starting right now you can eat real

food like a normal human being!

BILLY

No!

TED

You want to know something?! You are

a spoiled selfish little brat! Now

eat

TED

(yelling)

Goddamnit! Go to your room!

BILLY

(at the top of his

voice)

Owwww... You're hurting me... You're

hurting me... I hate you... I hate

you...

TED

(seething)

You're no bargain either, pal.

BILLY

I want my mommy... I want my mommy..

BILLY

(sobbing)

I want my... mm... ommy... I want

mmmy... mommy...

TED

(at the door)

Tough shit. You're stuck with me.

CUT TO:

BILLY (O.S.)

(sobbing, fighting to

catch his breath)

I want my... mmmo... mmmy. I want

mmmy mmo... mmy...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BILLY

(tentatively)

Daddy?

TED

(all anger gone)

Yeah?

BILLY

I'm sorry...

TED

(kisses him)

That's okay, pal. Go back to sleep.

It's very late.

BILLY

Daddy?

TED

Uh huh?

BILLY

(very quiet)

Are you... gonna go... away?

TED

Of course I'm not going away. I love

you very much. I'll be right here.

BILLY

(it comes pouring out)

That's why mommy left... isn't it?

'Cause I was bad...

TED

(he puts his arm around

Billy and holds him

close)

Oh, Christ... Oh, Christ...

(he thinks for a

moment, then:)

No, pal. Your mom loves you very

much. The reason she left didn't

have anything to do with you.

(pause, this is very

painful)

Look, I don't know if this will make

any sense to you, okay? But I'll try

and explain. You see the reason your

mom left was because... Well, I guess

it was because I kept trying to make

her into a certain kind of person...

Make her be the way I thought a wife

was supposed to be. Only she wasn't

like that. She was...

(smiles to himself)

Well, she wasn't like that. And now,

when I think about it, I can see she

tried very hard to be like I wanted

very hard. And when she couldn't,

then she tried to tell me about it.

Only I wouldn't listen. I guess I

thought that if I was happy, that

meant she was happy too. Only she

wasn't. The truth is, the only reason

she didn't leave a lot sooner was

because she loves you so much. Joanna

stayed until she couldn't stand me

any longer and then she left... But

it wasn't you, pal. It wasn't you.

BILLY

Is mom ever coming back?

TED

You mean for good?

TED

I don't think so.

BILLY

(thoughtfully)

Oh...

TED

Now go to sleep. It's very late.

BILLY

Good night.

TED

Sleep tight.

BILLY

Don't let the bedbugs bite.

TED

See you in the morning light.

BILLY

Dad?

TED

Yes?

BILLY

I love you...

(a little too casual)

Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?

THELMA

(also with deliberate

nonchalance)

Not for a couple of months. The last

time I heard from her she was living

in San Francisco.

TED

(surprised)

California?

THELMA

(watching him)

Uh, huh... She said she had a good

job, was playing a lot of tennis.

She wanted to know all about Billy.

TED

(the real question)

She ever ask about me?

THELMA

(lying)

Uh, huh... Yeah...

TED

What d'you tell her?

THELMA

I told her you're doing a pretty

good job.

Fantastic Superjet!

Daddy!

(calm, reassuring)

That's good, Billy... That's a brave

boy... Now then, how's that? Now

we've cleaned it out...

SURGEON

There. That wasn't so bad, was it?

SURGEON

Now then, you just wait here, Billy.

I want to talk to your dad for a

minute.

SURGEON

(low voice, again

calm and reassuring)

Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.

One inch over and it would have caught

the eye.

SURGEON

But I'm going to have to take some

stitches.

TED

(flat)

How many?

SURGEON

Ten.

SURGEON

Because of the position of the wound

and your son's age, I don't think

there will be much of a scar.

Otherwise I'd call in a plastic

surgeon.

SURGEON

Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.

It'll be eas

TED

(like a shot)

No.

SURGEON

(reasonable)

Mr. Kramer, there's

real vehemence)

Fuck you. He's my son. I'm staying

with him.

(softly, as each stitch

is taken)

Ohhh... Ohhhh... Ohhhhh...

child)

It's okay, son... I'm here... Just a

little more to go... Don't worry,

son... I'm here...

THELMA

How is he?

TED

(nods)

He's okay... Thel, can I ask you a

favor?

THELMA

Sure.

TED

I don't mean a little favor. I mean

a big F favor.

TED

Thelma, if I die

THELMA

(aghast)

What?

TED

(quickly)

I didn't say I'm going to die, but

if I should

THELMA

(deeply upset)

Don't say that! I don't want to hear

you say that!

TED

(firmly)

Thel, listen to me. If, on the million

to one shot that I should

(correcting himself)

That anything should happen to me.

Would you take care of Billy?

THELMA

(amazed)

Me?! You want me to take care of

Billy?!

TED

I thought about it a lot and you're

the only person I know that I trust

with him. I mean, if anything happened

to me, he'd be okay with you. You're

a good mother.

TED

(hastily)

I know it's not an easy thing to

answer.

TED

Look, if it's too much responsibility

TED

You're sure?

TED

Thank you, Thel. Thank you very much.

Good evening, Mr. Kramer. We haven't

seen you for a long time. Mrs. Kramer,

she waits for you in the back.

TED

Thank you, John.

JOANNA

Hello, Ted. You look well.

TED

So do you.

WAITER

The usual, Mr. Kramer.

TED

(not taking his eyes

off Joanna)

Thanks, Gino.

JOANNA

How's the new job?

TED

Fine.

TED

Look at us, Joanna. Just like any

old married couple having dinner.

Who would believe it.

JOANNA

Yes... How's Billy?

TED

He's great... except...

(not looking at her)

...Except he had... he fell and he

cut his face. He... He has a scar,

Joanna, from about here to here.

(indicating where and

how big)

TED

(he has to say it to

someone)

I can't help but feel somehow...

it's my fault. I keep thinking I

could've done something  stopped

it...

JOANNA

You can't tell it from a distance,

Ted.

TED

What?

JOANNA

I've seen him.

TED

You have?

JOANNA

A few times. Sometimes I sit in that

coffee shop across the street and

watch when you take him to school.

JOANNA

He looks like a terrific kid.

TED

He is...

(he still can't get

over it)

You sat in that coffee shop across

from school

JOANNA

(completing the

sentence)

Watching my son... Ted, I've been

living in New York for the past two

months.

TED

(amazed)

You've been living here, in the city?

JOANNA

(a deep breath)

Ted... The reason I wanted to see

you... I want Billy back.

TED

You want what?!

JOANNA

(firm)

I want my son. I'm through sitting

in coffee shops looking at him from

across the street. I want my son.

TED

Are you out of your mind?! You're

the one that walked out on him,

remember?

JOANNA

(trying to explain)

Ted, listen to me... You and I, we

had a really crappy marriage

(hastily)

Look, don't get so defensive, okay?

It was probably as much my fault as

it was yours... Anyway when I left I

was really screwed up

TED

Joanna, I don't give a

JOANNA

(she will be heard)

Ted, all my life I'd either been

somebody's daughter or somebody's

wife, or somebody else's mother.

Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-

two-year-old, highly neurotic woman

who had just walked out on her husband

and child. I went to California

because that was about as far away

as I could get. Only... I guess it

wasn't far enough. So I started going

to a shrink.

(leaning forward,

very sincere)

Ted, I've had time to think. I've

been through some changes. I've

learned a lot about myself.

TED

(like a shot)

Such as?

TED

(boring in)

Come on, Joanna, what did you learn?

I'd really like to know.

TED

(relentless)

One thing, okay? Just tell me one

goddam thing you've learned.

JOANNA

(quiet, determined)

I've learned that I want my son.

TED

Joanna, go be a mother. Get married,

have kids. Don't get married, have

kids. Do whatever you want. I don't

give a damn. Just leave me out of it

and leave my baby out of it.

JOANNA

Ted, if you can't discuss this

rationally -

TED

(getting to his feet)

Joanna, go fuck yourself!

CUT TO:

TED

(leaning forward,

intense)

Look, she walked out on her own child,

right? That's desertion, right? Mr.

Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an

open and shut case.

SHAUNESSY

First, there's no such thing as an

open and shut case. Especially where

custody is involved. Got it?

SHAUNESSY

Second, the burden is on us to prove

your ex-wife is an unfit mother.

That means I'm going to have to play

rough and, if I play rough, you can

bet they will too. Can you take that,

Mr. Kramer?

SHAUNESSY

Third, it'll cost you five thousand

dollars.

SHAUNESSY

That's if we win. If we lose, you

could end up having to pay your wife's

court costs as well.

TED

(determined)

Fine.

SHAUNESSY

Good. You've hired yourself a hell

of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.

(down to business)

How old is the child?

TED

Six.

SHAUNESSY

That's tough. In most cases involving

a child that young, the court tends

to side with the mother.

TED

But she signed over custody. Here...

SHAUNESSY

(glancing at it)

I'm not saying we don't have a shot,

but it won't be easy...

(thinks for a moment)

Mr. Kramer, do me a favor. There is

something I find very helpful in

matters like this. I sit down and

make a list of all the pros and cons

on an issue. I actually write them

down and look at them. I want you to

do that, okay? Then, after that, if

you're really sure you want to retain

custody of your child  then we'll

go in there and whip their asses.

they did some marketing tests on our

Disappointing. It only pulled a

fourteen share and they were hoping

for a twenty five minimum, and...

ah... they're not very happy and...

Well, the guys have decided they

want to... ah, re-think the entire

concept and... Look, I don't like

having to do this, okay?... But... I

to have to... ah, let you go

heard right)

Are you firing me, Jim?

C'mon, Ted, don't get emotional.

Okay?

Look, this isn't exactly an easy

thing for me to do, y'know? I swear

Murray and I did everything we could,

TED

You bet your ass.

CUT TO:

TED (O.S.)

So, Mr. Ackerman, as you can see

from my resume, my experience in

setting up the leisure package concept

means that I've spent a lot of time

working along the same lines as your

multiple buys and your regional

advertising ideas. I know the

pitfalls, but  and this is more

important  I know the potential

revenue for the company inherent in

these programs.

ACKERMAN

Well, Mr. Kramer, I must say this

has been very impressive. I'd like

to think about it and get back to

you.

TED

(leaning forward)

Mr. Ackerman, is there anyone else

that I should see before you come to

a decision.

ACKERMAN

Mr. Spencer, our Advertising Director.

TED

(no time to waste)

Could I see him right away?

ACKERMAN

(taken aback)

I'm sorry, but he's leaving this

evening for a two-week vacation.

I'll set up something the moment he

gets back.

TED

I'd like to see him now  before he

leaves.

ACKERMAN

Mr. Kramer, I don't think

TED

(means it)

I want this position very much.

ACKERMAN

Wait here.

CUT TO:

ACKERMAN

(as they enter)

Mr. Spencer, Mr. Kramer.

SPENCER

(not wasting any time)

So you're the go-getter. All right,

you've got ten minutes.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

SPENCER

(sipping his drink)

That's very interesting, Mr. Kramer.

I must say, it's very interesting.

Let me think about it. I'll let

Jack...

(indicating Ackerman)

...know and he'll get in touch with

you.

TED

Excuse me, I believe you said I had

ten minutes.

SPENCER

Well?

TED

That means I've got two minutes left.

I understand you're paying twenty-

five.

TED

(a deep breath, then

a real huckster)

All right, I'll tell you what I'm

gonna do  I'll take the job at twenty-

two-five. Now, that's twenty-five

hundred less than you're offering.

The only thing is, you have to say

yes right now. Not tomorrow. Not

next week. Not after the holidays.

It's worth it to me for a yes right

now and I'll take twenty-five hundred

less.

TED

(watching them)

Today only. One day only. Twenty-two

five.

SPENCER

Mr. Kramer, can we talk privately

for a moment?

TED

Certainly.

CUT TO:

ACKERMAN

Mr. Kramer?

Welcome aboard, Mr. Kramer.

Well, gentlemen, I'm pleased to be

with you.

You're a terrific kid, Billy Kramer.

TED'S VOICE

Hello?

SHAUNESSY'S VOICE

Ted? John Shaunessy here. I just got

a call from your wife's lawyer. She

wants to see the kid.

CUT TO:

TED

What?! She wants what?!

SHAUNESSY'S VOICE

(he's been through

this a million times)

She's the mother. That means she's

within her legal rights.

TED

(agitated)

John, what if she kidnaps him. I've

heard all these

SHAUNESSY

(the patience of a

saint)

Look, Ted, I don't honestly think

she would go to the trouble of suing

you for custody of the child if she

was planning on kidnapping him.

TED

(doubtful)

I don't know, John... I mean, to be

brutally honest, I'm not so sure

what kind of mental shape Joanna's

in right now. Y'know she admitted

she was seeing a shrink.

SHAUNESSY'S VOICE

(a flicker of interest)

You ever see her talk to the walls?

TED

No, but

SHAUNESSY'S VOICE

Then you don't have a choice. Have

Billy at the Seventy-Fifth Street

entrance to Central Park, Saturday

at ten.

CUT TO:

BILLY

Mommy!

JOANNA

(somewhere between

laughter and tears)

Oh, Billy... Oh my Billy... Oh my

son...

at Billy)

I'll have him back at six.

(he has become an

armchair lawyer)

So, naturally, you assume that since

Joanna left, that would be a

compelling point against her, right?

PHYLLIS

(thoughtful)

Right.

TED

But it doesn't work that way. A major

decision was handed down by the

Appellate Court in 1969  in the

case of Haskins vs. Haskins.

PHYLLIS

Kramer

TED

Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court

ruled in favor of the mother, thus

establishing a precedent for awarding

the child to the mother even though

she previously abandoned the baby.

PHYLLIS

Kramer... There's something I ought

to tell you.

TED

Yeah?

PHYLLIS

I've been offered a job in Washington

with H.E.W.

TED

And?

PHYLLIS

(a deep breath)

I'm going to take it.

PHYLLIS

It's a very good job  too good to

pass up. I'll be handling funding

for the whole...

him on the bed)

Look, I...

(she means love)

..."like" me, okay? Maybe if it was

a year from now, maybe things would

be different...

TED

(quiet)

But it's not a year from now, is it?

PHYLLIS

I'll miss you, Kramer...

ALVAREZ

Mr. Kramer?

TED

Yes?

ALVAREZ

I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked

me to look in on your son and prepare

an evaluation sheet.

TED

Oh, yes. Won't you come in.

ALVAREZ

Where is the child?

TED

He's in his room, playing.

ALVAREZ

Good. I'll see him in there.

ALVAREZ

Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in

here with anyone?

TED

Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social

life discreetly. At the moment I am

seeing no one.

ALVAREZ

Does that distress you?

TED

Not particularly.

ALVAREZ

What does?

TED

The prospect of losing my child.

ALVAREZ

(makes some notes,

then:)

Very well, I'd like to see him if I

may.

TED

Billy. This is Dr. Alvarez. She would

like to talk to you.

BILLY

(looking up from his

toys)

Sure.

DR. ALVAREZ

(pointedly)

I'd like to talk to Billy privately.

TED

(embarrassed at being

caught)

Oh, yeah...

ALVAREZ (O.S.)

What do you have here, Billy?

BILLY (O.S.)

Detroit.

ALVAREZ (O.S.)

Have you ever been to Detroit?

BILLY (O.S.)

No. But I've been to Brooklyn.

ALVAREZ (O.S.)

I see you have people there. What

are their names?

BILLY (O.S.)

That's Kim... and this one's Thelma

and that's Mrs. Willewska and this

is daddy and that's Batman and over

there is Robin.

ALVAREZ (O.S.)

What about your mommy?

BILLY (O.S.)

Oh, sure. Here, this can be mommy.

ALVAREZ (O.S.)

Do you like to be with your mommy?

TED

(the defense attorney)

Objection. You're leading the witness.

BILLY (O.S.)

Sure.

ALVAREZ (O.S.)

What do you like best about her?

BILLY (O.S.)

Lunch in a restaurant.

ALVAREZ (O.S.)

What do you like best about your

daddy?

BILLY (O.S.)

Playing.

ALVAREZ (O.S.)

Tell me, does your daddy ever hit

you?

TED

Objection.

BILLY (O.S.)

Sure. Lots of times.

ALVAREZ (O.S.)

(interested)

When does he hit you?

BILLY (O.S.)

He hits me on the planet Kriptarium,

when I steal the buried treasure

from the famous peanut butter factory.

ALVAREZ (O.S.)

In real life when does he hit you?

BILLY (O.S.)

My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why

would my daddy hit me?

No, she never did.

CLERK

Oyez, oyez... The third Circuit Court

of the State of New York, Judge Atkins

presiding is now in session. All

rise...

GRESSEN

Your honor. As our first witness I

would like to call Joanna Kramer.

SHAUNESSY

(stage whisper)

Real direct. Motherhood... They're

going right for the throat.

GRESSEN

Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you

tell the court how long you were

married?

JOANNA

Six years.

GRESSEN

And would you describe those years

as happy?

JOANNA

The first couple, yes, but after

that it became increasingly difficult.

GRESSEN

Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a

job while you were married to your

ex-husband?

JOANNA

No, I did not.

GRESSEN

Did you wish to?

JOANNA

Yes. I tried to talk to Ted  my ex-

husband  about it, but he wouldn't

listen. He refuses to discuss it in

any serious way. I remember one time

he said I probably couldn't get a

job that would pay enough to hire a

baby-sitter for Billy.

GRESSEN

Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed

at the present time?

JOANNA

Yes, I work for Jantzen as a

sportswear designer.

GRESSEN

And what is your present salary?

JOANNA

I make thirty-one thousand dollars a

year.

GRESSEN

(switching tactics)

Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?

JOANNA

(emphatically)

Yes. Very much.

GRESSEN

And yet you chose to leave him?

JOANNA

(speaking carefully,

with great thought)

Yes... Look, during the last five

years we were married, I had... I

was getting more and more... unhappy,

more and more frustrated. I needed

to talk to somebody. I needed to

find out if it was me, if I was going

crazy or what. But every time I turned

to Ted  my ex-husband, he couldn't

handle it. He became very... I don't

know, very threatened. I mean,

whenever I would bring up anything

he would act like it was some kind

of personal attack. Anyway, we became

more and more separate... more and

more isolated from one another.

Finally, I had no other choice, I

had to leave. And because of my ex-

husband's attitude  his unwillingness

to deal with my feelings, I had come

to have almost no self-esteem...

(with feeling)

At the time I left, I sincerely

believed that there was something

wrong with me  that my son would be

better off without me. It was only

when I got to California and started

into therapy I began to realize I

wasn't a terrible person. And that

just because I needed some creative

and emotional outlet other than my

child, that didn't make me unfit to

be a mother.

GRESSEN

(to the judge)

Your honor, I would like to place in

evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's

therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore

Freedman of La Jolla, California.

GRESSEN

Mr. Kramer, why did you set up

residence in New York?

JOANNA

Because my son is here. And his father

is here. As a mother, I don't want

my child to be separated from his

father.

GRESSEN

Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court

why you are asking for custody?

JOANNA

Because he's my child... Because I

love him. I know I left my son, I

know that's a terrible thing to do.

Believe me, I have to live with that

every day of my life. But just because

I'm a woman, don't I have a right to

the same hopes and dreams as a man?

Don't I have a right to a life of my

own? Is that so awful? Is my pain

any less just because I'm a woman?

Are my feelings any cheaper? I left

my child  I know there is no excuse

for that. But since then, I have

gotten help. I have worked hard to

become a whole human being. I don't

think I should be punished for that.

I don't think my son should be

punished for that. Billy's only six.

He needs me. I'm not saying he doesn't

need his father, but he needs me

more. I'm his mother.

GRESSEN

Thank you, Mrs. Kramer. I have no

further questions.

SHAUNESSY

Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you

were married seven years. Is that

correct?

JOANNA

Yes.

SHAUNESSY

In all that time did your husband

ever strike you or abuse you

physically in any way.

JOANNA

No.

SHAUNESSY

Did your husband strike or physically

abuse his child in any way?

JOANNA

No.

SHAUNESSY

Would you describe your husband as

an alcoholic?

JOANNA

No.

SHAUNESSY

A heavy drinker?

JOANNA

No.

SHAUNESSY

Was he unfaithful?

JOANNA

No.

SHAUNESSY

Did he ever fail to provide for you?

JOANNA

No.

SHAUNESSY

(wry smile)

Well, I can certainly understand why

you left him.

GRESSEN

Objection.

SHAUNESSY

(switching his line

of questioning)

How long do you plan to live in New

York, Mrs. Kramer?

JOANNA

Permanently.

SHAUNESSY

Permanently?

(smiles, like a shark

smiles)

Mrs. Kramer, how many boy friends

have you had  permanently?

JOANNA

I don't recall.

SHAUNESSY

(boring in)

How many lovers have you had

permanently?

JOANNA

(looks toward Gressen

for help)

I don't recall.

SHAUNESSY

More than three, less than thirty-

three  permanently?

GRESSEN

Objection!

JUDGE

Overruled. The witness will answer,

please.

JOANNA

(almost a whisper)

Somewhere in between.

SHAUNESSY

Do you have a lover now?

GRESSEN

(furious)

Objection!

SHAUNESSY

(to the judge)

Your honor, I would request a direct

answer to a direct question. Does

she have a lover?

JUDGE

I'll allow that. The witness will

answer please.

JOANNA

(in a whisper)

Yes.

SHAUNESSY

Is that... permanent?

JOANNA

(by now she is becoming

thoroughly rattled)

I... I don't know...

SHAUNESSY

Then, we don't really know, do we,

when you say "permanently" if you're

planning to remain in New York, or

even to keep the child for that

matter, since you've never really

done anything in your life that was

continuing, stable, that could be

regarded as permanent.

GRESSEN

Objection! I must ask that the counsel

be prevented from harassing the

witness.

JUDGE

Sustained.

SHAUNESSY

(a new attack)

Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider

yourself a fit mother when you have

been a failure at virtually every

relationship you have undertaken as

an adult?

GRESSEN

(red in the face)

Objection!

JUDGE

Sustained.

SHAUNESSY

I'll ask it another way. What was

the longest personal relationship

you have had in your life  other

than parents and girlfriends?

JOANNA

(rattled)

Ah... I guess I'd have to say...

with my child.

SHAUNESSY

(wonder, irony)

Whom you've seen twice in a year?

Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't

he the longest personal relationship

in your life?

JOANNA

(reluctantly)

I suppose...

SHAUNESSY

Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I

couldn't hear you.

JOANNA

(louder)

Yes.

SHAUNESSY

How long was that?

JOANNA

We were married two years before the

baby. And then four very difficult

years.

SHAUNESSY

So, you were a failure at the longest,

most important relationship in your

life.

GRESSEN

Objection!

JUDGE

Overruled.

JOANNA

I was not a failure.

SHAUNESSY

(sarcastic)

Oh? What do you call it then  a

success? The marriage ended in

divorce.

JOANNA

(so angry she forgets

her cool)

I consider it less my failure than

his.

SHAUNESSY

(seizes on this)

Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You

have just rewritten matrimonial law.

You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.

GRESSEN

(on his feet)

Objection!

SHAUNESSY

(to the judge)

Your honor, I'd like to ask what

this model of stability and

respectability has ever succeeded

at?

(to Joanna)

Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at

the longest, most important personal

relationship in your life?

JUDGE

Please answer the question, Mrs.

Kramer.

JOANNA

(whisper)

It did not succeed.

SHAUNESSY

(suddenly fierce)

Not it... Not it, Mrs. Kramer  you.

Were you a failure at the most

important personal relationship of

your life?

SHAUNESSY

Were you?

JOANNA

(barely audible)

Yes.

SHAUNESSY

No further questions.

TED

(leaning over, in a

whisper)

Jesus Christ. Did you have to be so

rough on her?

SHAUNESSY

(tough)

Do you want the kid or don't you?

CUT TO:

GRESSEN

Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did

Ted Kramer work for you?

O'CONNOR

Eight, almost nine years.

GRESSEN

And did you have a close personal

relationship?

O'CONNOR

(in a whisper)

Yes...

GRESSEN

And how did you find his work?

O'CONNOR

It was good. He was a hard worker, a

lot of drive, a real hustler.

GRESSEN

And yet you fired him.

O'CONNOR

(looking down)

Ted was a good worker. But, ah...

after his wife left him and he was

taking care of the kid on his own,

things started to change. Look, I

know he had problems, I understand

that. I've got problems, everybody's

got problems. But I've got a shop to

run, I can't let that kind of thing

get in the way...

(quietly)

I guess I felt that Ted was letting

his duties at home interfere with

his responsibilities in the office.

GRESSEN

Thank you. I have no further

questions.

SHAUNESSY

Mr. O'Connor, does the agency still

have the Fire and Ice account?

O'CONNOR

(up tight)

No.

SHAUNESSY

Mr. O'Connor, can you tell me where

you are employed at the moment?

O'CONNOR

(stiff)

At the moment I am unemployed.

JUDGE

If the petitioner has no further

witnesses, we will hear the respondent

Uh, huh?

BILLY

his books)

you do.

BILLY

Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"

TED

(distracted)

Uh, uh... We didn't have television

then.

BILLY

You didn't have T.V.?

TED

Nope. It hadn't been invented yet.

BILLY

business)

Was there apple juice when you were

little?

TED

Yeah, there was apple juice.

BILLY

Was there Burger King?

TED

Uh, uh. There was no such a thing as

Burger King.

BILLY

What else wasn't there?

TED

Well, let's see... There wasn't

McDonald's. And there wasn't

astronauts... And there wasn't frozen

yogurt. And there wasn't...

FADE TO BLACK:

SHAUNESSY

Mrs. Phillips, how long have you

known Ted Kramer?

THELMA

Six years. Ever since Ted and Joanna

moved into the building.

SHAUNESSY

How often do you see Mr. Kramer and

his son?

THELMA

(to the judge, by way

of explanation)

Charley, my husband, and I are...

divorced and Kim, that's our daughter

is about Billy's age and the children

play together a lot. So, I guess we

see each three or four times a week.

SHAUNESSY

Can you describe the relationship

between Mr. Kramer and his son?

THELMA

It's beautiful. It's just beautiful.

They have a beautiful relationship.

GRESSEN

(patronizing)

Objection, your honor. The answer

is, to be generous, very vague.

SHAUNESSY

Can you recall any particular incident

that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of

his child?

THELMA

(fighting a losing

battle with her

emotions)

Ted  Mr. Kramer, spends a great

deal of time with his child. I don't

just mean hours, I mean good time,

involved time. He reads to Billy.

They play together. They talk all

the time...

(tears start)

He is a very... kind man... a very...

devoted father, and... and...

(she turns to Joanna)

And Joanna if you ever saw them

together... there wouldn't be a trial

at all...

(she breaks down,

weeping)

Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

SHAUNESSY

(gently)

No further questions. Thank you Mrs.

Phillips.

GRESSEN

(without looking up

from his notes)

No questions.

CUT TO:

SHAUNESSY

Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court

exactly why you want to retain custody

of your child.

TED

(speaking quietly)

When Joanna

(to the judge,

correcting himself)

my ex-wife  when she was talking

before about how unhappy she was

during our marriage... Well, I guess

most of what she said was probably

true. There were a lot of things I

didn't understand  a lot of things

I would do different if I could.

Just like I guess there are a lot of

things Joanna wishes she could

change... But we can't. Some things,

once they are done, can't be undone.

Joanna says she loves Billy. I believe

she does. So do I. But the way it

was explained to me, that's not the

issue. The only thing that's supposed

to matter here is what's best for

Billy... When Joanna said why

shouldn't a woman have the same

ambitions as a man, I suppose she's

right. But by the same token what

law is it that says a woman is a

better parent simply by virtue of

her sex? I guess I've had to think a

lot about whatever it is that makes

somebody a good parent: constancy,

patience, understanding... love.

Where is it written that a man has

any less of those qualities than a

woman? Billy has a home with me,

I've tried to make it the best I

could. It's not perfect. I'm not a

perfect parent.

(unconsciously echoing

something Joanna

said earlier)

I don't have enough patience.

Sometimes I forget he's just a little

kid... But I love him... More than

anything in this world I love him.

SHAUNESSY

Thank you, Mr. Kramer. No further

questions.

GRESSEN

(hard-lining it)

Mr. Kramer, by any chance have you

ever had a woman in your bed while

your child was asleep in the next

room?

TED

I suppose.

GRESSEN

(pointedly)

So do I.

SHAUNESSY

Objection!

JUDGE

Sustained.

GRESSEN

(switching to another

line of attack)

Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you

were fired from your last job not

more than six weeks ago?

TED

(not losing his cool)

Technically, the agency lost a big

account and seventy four people were

let go. I was one of them.

GRESSEN

(snotty)

You were fired, correct?

TED

Yes, but I'm with J. Walter Thompson

now. I don't think that will happen

again.

GRESSEN

(snide)

Give them time...

SHAUNESSY

Objection, your honor! Counsel is

harassing the witness.

GRESSEN

(to the judge, pettish)

Your honor, I'm only examining the

man's employment record. He pretends

to fitness when he cannot hold a

job.

JUDGE

Sustained.

GRESSEN

(very tough)

Mr. Kramer, did your child nearly

lose an eye when he was in your care?

GRESSEN

(boring in)

Mr. Kramer, did you, or did you not

tell the child's mother that you

were responsible for the injury that

permanently disfigured your child?

SHAUNESSY

(vehement)

Objection! Your honor, counsel is

raising a question that is not germane

to these proceedings.

GRESSEN

(to the judge)

While the child was in the care of

the witness, he cut his face badly

and is now scarred.

JUDGE

(to Gressen)

Are you introducing the question of

negligence here, counselor?

GRESSEN

Yes, your honor.

JUDGE

I see. Well, you'll have to do better

than that. Do you have any affidavits

to support negligence?

GRESSEN

I do not, your honor, however

JUDGE

This is an isolated incident,

counselor, unless you can prove

otherwise.

GRESSEN

(back to Ted)

Does the witness deny the injury

took place?

JUDGE

(before Ted can say

anything)

No, counselor, I'm going to over-

rule you on this line of questioning.

GRESSEN

Then I have concluded my questions.

CUT TO:

JOANNA (O.S.)

Ted.

JOANNA

I'm sorry... I just mentioned it in

passing. I never thought he'd use

it.

Yeah, well he did, didn't he.

JOANNA

Please, Ted. I never would have

brought it up if I thought

TED

I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.

getting back together.

You and Charley?

TED

Really?

TED

(conflicting emotions)

Hey, that's terrific.

THELMA

(hastily)

Maybe. I said maybe.

(apologizing for her

good fortune)

What I mean is, ah... I don't think

it'll really work out, but Charley

seems to want it, so...

THELMA

(can't help grinning)

Oh, God... Ted, I am really scared.

TED

(to Thelma, urgent)

C'mon.

(to Billy and Kim)

Billy, Kim. Let's go.

CUT TO:

TED

Well?

TED

Oh, Christ!

SHAUNESSY

The judge went for motherhood straight

down the line.

TED

I lost him? I lost him?

SHAUNESSY

I can't tell you how sorry I am.

TED

Oh, no..

SHAUNESSY

(reading from a piece

of paper)

Ordered, adjudged and decreed that

the petitioner be awarded custody of

the minor child, effective Monday

the 23rd of January. That the

respondent pay for the maintenance

and support of said child, four

hundred dollars each month. That the

father shall have the following rights

of visitation: every other weekend,

one night each week to be mutually

agreed upon and one half of the

child's vacation period.

(looks up at Ted)

That's it.

TED

(grim)

What if I fight it?

SHAUNESSY

(matter of factly)

We can appeal, but I can't guarantee

anything.

TED

(determined)

I'll take my chances.

SHAUNESSY

It's going to cost.

TED

(his mind is made up)

Don't worry. I'll get the money.

SHAUNESSY

I've got to tell you something, Ted.

This time it'll be Billy that pays.

This time I'll have to put him on

the stand.

TED

Oh, Christ no... I can't do that. I

just... can't...

(he looks up at the

lawyer in despair)

Excuse me... I'm sorry... I just...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

THELMA

(calling out)

Ted!... It's me... Ted?...

TED (O.S.)

(very quiet)

Please go away, Thel... I... I just

have to be by myself for a little

while...

THELMA

Ted, I just heard...

TED (O.S.)

Please, Thel...

THELMA

I'm so... sorry... Oh, Ted, I'm so

sorry...

FADE TO BLACK:

CUT TO:

BILLY

(excited)

Daddy! You're home early. Did you

get fired again?

TED

(laughing in spite of

himself)

No, son, I didn't get fired.

(fake cheerful)

I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?

How about if we go to a Burger King

and then we watch a little T.V. and

then we get packed to go to the

country tomorrow. Just you and me...

How 'bout that?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TED (V.O.)

Joanna... This is by way of

introducing William Kramer. He is a

sweet child, as you will see. He is

allergic to grape juice, but will

more than make up for the loss in

apple juice. He is also allergic to

peanut butter from the health food

store, but not from the supermarket.

Don't ask me why.

CUT TO:

TED (V.O.)

At times, in the night he will have

nightmares, one particular monster

is called The Face. The Face, as

best as I can determine, looks like

a circus clown without a body, and

from what the pediatrician says, and

what I have read, may be sexual fear

of losing his penis, or a fear of

his own anger, or just a circus clown

he saw once.

CUT TO:

TED (V.O.)

His doctor, by the way, is still Ed

Davies. The Sundafed is for colds,

one tablespoon every four hours. I

will pack it in the blue suitcase.

CUT TO:

TED (V.O.)

His best stories have been Babar and

Winnie the Pooh up to now, with Batman

moving up. His housekeeper has been

Etta Willewska and she is the main

reason for the note. She is a loving

woman, conscientious, very concerned

about Billy and more important, Billy

cares about her.

CUT TO:

TED (V.O.)

I urge you to retain her. Her number

is 722-8099, and I think she will

take the job if it is offered. I'm

sure other things will come up. Ask

me what you need to and I guess

eventually we'll talk...

CUT TO:

TED (V.O.)

That's all I can think of, except to

repeat what I said before, he's a

terrific kid. I'm grateful for the

time we've had together and I feel I

am a better man because of my son...

Ted.

CUT TO:

TED

Billy, sometimes when a mother and a

father are divorced, there's a

discussion about who the child should

live with, the mother or the father.

Now there is a man who is very wise.

He's called a judge. And a judge has

a lot of experience with divorces

and he decides who it would be best

for the child to live with.

BILLY

Why does he decide?

TED

Because... Well, that's what he does.

He's a very powerful man.

BILLY

Like a principal?

TED

Bigger than a principal. The judge

sits in robes in a big chair... The

judge has thought a lot about us,

about you and me and your mom, and

he has decided...

(a deep breath)

...he has decided that it would be

best for you to live with your mom

Joanna in her apartment.

(fake cheerful)

And I'm very lucky. Because even

though you'll live with your mom

Joanna I'll get to see you once a

week for dinner and a couple of

weekends a month.

BILLY

I don't understand, daddy.

TED

(trying very hard not

to cry)

What don't you understand, pal?

BILLY

Where will my bed be, where will I

sleep?

TED

At your mom's. She'll have a bed for

you in your own room.

BILLY

Where will my toys be?

TED

I'll send your toys there and I'm

sure you'll get some new ones.

BILLY

Who will read me my stories?

TED

Your mom.

BILLY

(worried)

Daddy, what if The Face comes when

I'm at mommy's?

TED

Your mom knows all about The Face,

okay? Don't worry, she'll tell The

Face to beat it.

BILLY

Will you come and say good-night to

me every night?

TED

Look, it's getting cold. Why don't

you go inside where it's warm. I'll

be along in a minute.

TED

Go on, scoot.

FADE TO BLACK:

CUT TO:

TED

(with false gaiety)

Hey? What's doin' with that bread?

Let's see a little hustle around

here.

CUT TO:

TED

This is it, pal.

CUT TO:

TED

Yes?

JOANNA'S VOICE

Ted, it's Joanna. Can you meet me in

the lobby?... Alone?

TED

(to Mrs. Willewska,

in the kitchen)

I'll be back in a minute.

CUT TO:

TED

(abrupt)

Okay, I'm here. Now why did you

JOANNA

Ted, do you love him?

TED

Goddamnit, Joanna. What the

JOANNA

(insistent)

Ted, do you love him?

JOANNA

I love him too... I don't think I

ever knew how much until now.

JOANNA

(a deep breath, then:)

Ted, when we got married it was

because I was twenty-seven years old

and I thought I should get married

and... when I had Billy it was because

I thought I should have a baby...

and I guess all I did was mess up my

life and your life and

TED

Joanna, what the hell is

JOANNA

(urgent)

Please... Please don't stop me. This

is the hardest thing I've ever had

to do..

JOANNA

After I left... when I was in

California, I began to think, what

kind of mother was I that I could

walk out on my own child. It got to

where I couldn't tell anybody about

Billy  I couldn't stand that look

in their faces when I said he wasn't

living with me. Finally it seemed

like the most important thing in the

world to come back here and prove to

Billy and to me and to the world how

much I loved him... And I did... And

I won. Only... it was just another

"should."

(she begins to break

down)

...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing

everything you did, everything you

went through... Something happened.

I guess it doesn't matter how much I

love him, or how much you love him.

I guess it's like you said, the only

thing that counts is what's best for

Billy. I don't know, maybe that's

all love is anyway... Ted, I think

Billy should stay with you...

TED

(stunned)

What?

JOANNA

(she reaches out,

takes his hand)

He's already got one mother, he

doesn't need two... He's yours...

(her last ounce of

reserve crumbles)

I won't fight you for him any more.

He's yours...

TED

Oh, God... Oh, my God...

JOANNA

Only can I still see him?

TED

No more waiting in Coffee Shops... I

promise.

JOANNA

(chin high)

Okay... I think I'll go talk to my

son now.

(wiping her eyes)

How do I look?

TED

Beautiful.
