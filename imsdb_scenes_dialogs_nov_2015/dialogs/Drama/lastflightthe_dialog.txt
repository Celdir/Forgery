THE LAST FLIGHT

Written by

John Monk Saunders

SHEP (o.s.)

Level off, Cary! Level off!

CARY

Shep! Shep, are you all right?

SHEP

Can't make it, Cary. Can't make it.

CARY

Here, give me your arm! I'll get

you out of here! Hang on there,

Shep! Get a hold - Just hold tight,

old fella.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CARY

Well, the old guerre is finie.

SHEP

That's right.

CARY

What are ya gonna do now, Shep?

SHEP

Get tight.

CARY

(turns to him)

And then what?

SHEP

Stay tight.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

Lieutenants Lambert and Lockwood.

(rises, joins them)

You two leaving us, eh? In a way,

I'm sorry to release you two. I have

no choice in the matter.

SHEP

What am I going to do, Major, about

my-- oh, this rotten business?

DOCTOR

Mm? Spasmodic twitching of the

muscles under the eye, eh,

Lieutenant?

SHEP

Mm hm.

DOCTOR

What the French call a tic. T-I-C,

tic. Little bothersome, isn't it?

SHEP

Yes, sir.

DOCTOR

I'm afraid time'll have to take care

of that. Time and normal living.

DOCTOR

You two are returning to the United

States, I presume?

CARY

Ah, we haven't decided.

DOCTOR

I'd take the first boat home. Well,

here you go.

DOCTOR

Oh, I forgot your burnt hands.

DOCTOR

Neither of you is fully hospitalized.

I'd undertake a systematic course of

finger exercises -- to, uh, stretch

them and loosen them up. In time,

you'll regain their full use.

CARY

Thank you, sir.

DOCTOR

Bye, Lieutenant.

DOCTOR

Bye, Lieutenant. Good luck.

DOCTOR

Well, there they go. Out to face

life.

(shakes his head)

And their whole training was in

preparation for death.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

AIDE

Why can't they go on with flying?

You know, the air mails or

something?

DOCTOR

I'm afraid they're unfit for further

service in that direction.

DOCTOR

They fell, you know -- six thousand

meters.

(shakes his head, sadly)

Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on

the pavement. Shattered both of them.

Their nervous systems are deranged,

disorganized, brittle.

AIDE

Spent bullets.

DOCTOR

Spent bullets. That's it.

(nods)

They're like projectiles, shaped

for war and hurled at the enemy.

(gestures with cigarette)

They've described a beautiful,

high-arching trajectory. And now

they've fallen back to earth.

Spent. Cooled off. Useless.

AIDE

Oh, well, if they take care of

themselves, they'll pull through

all right.

DOCTOR

Even if they do take care of

themselves, what good are they?

What can you expect of them?

(shakes his head)

I hate to think what may become

of them.

CUT TO:

BILL

(Texas accent)

Hello, Cary!

FRANCIS

Hi, Cary!

CARY

Hello, Bill! Hiya, Francis!

SHEP

Hello, Bill! Francis!

CARY

(friendly)

Well, I see you got yours.

BILL

(pleasantly)

Yup. We crashed.

BILL

(calls down, puzzled)

Hey! Where you going?

CARY

Paris!

BILL (o.s.)

Paris?!

BILL

See you in Paris!

FRANCIS

(waves his cigarette)

Yeah.

DISSOLVE TO:

PARIS -- 1919.

DISSOLVE TO:

CARY

How 'bout a cocktail?

SHEP

Not a bad idea at that.

BRIEF DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CARY

I beg your pardon. But, if I'm not

too inquisitive, would you mind

telling me what IS that you're

drinking?

NIKKI

Teeth.

CARY

Teeth?

CARY

Hey, it's teeth!

BILL (o.s.)

Teeth?!

SHEP

Teeth!

NIKKI

That's right.

BILL

(enthusiastic)

Yup. It's a full set -- upper and

lower.

CARY

(to Nikki)

It's a nice expression.

SHEP

Hey, how come you're with those

teeth?

NIKKI

I was just standing here. And a nice

gentleman came along and begged my

pardon and asked would I mind

holding his teeth for a minute.

CARY

Well, what did he want you to hold

his teeth for?

NIKKI

Said he wanted to biff somebody.

BILL

(excited)

Biff somebody?! Which way did he go?!

NIKKI

Just around to the right.

BILL

Come on, men! We're liable to see a

fight.

CARY

Would you like to come along?

NIKKI

(as if it were obvious)

Oh, no. I have to stay here and mind

the man's teeth.

CARY

Oh, of course.

BILL

Well. THAT'S all fixed.

CARY

Let's go back.

CARY

Oh, there she is.

BILL

Well, we missed it.

NIKKI

Did something happen?

BILL

Well, they carried a guy out.

(sees her empty glass)

Say! What's become of the teeth?

NIKKI

Oh, the man came and got his teeth.

CARY

Well, what did he say?

NIKKI

He said thank you for holding his

teeth.

CARY

What did he look like?

NIKKI

I think he fell in an airplane in

the war -- and got his teeth knocked

out.

CARY

Well, why do you think he was in the

war?

NIKKI

Oh, he had a kind of little striped

ribbon in his buttonhole.

CARY

What makes you think he was a flyer?

NIKKI

His eyes.

CARY

His eyes?

(dry, to the others)

You can tell a flyer better by his

ears.

SHEP

Well, what do you say we have a

drink?

BILL

Fine!

FRANCIS

Sure, here's some space.

SHEP

Hello, Jean!

JEAN

Bon soir, Monsieur Lambert.

Qu'est-ce que voulez-vous [?]

FRANCIS

Martini!

BILL

Martini!

CARY

Martini!

SHEP

Martiniiii!

NIKKI

Could I have a champagne cocktail?

JEAN

Certainment, Mademoiselle.

(calls off)

Quatre Martinis pour messieurs!

Champagne cocktail pour Mademoiselle

Nikki!

FRANCIS

Nikki?!

BILL

Nikki?!

CARY

Nikki?!

SHEP

Can you imagine that, fellas? Her

name is Nikki!

CARY

(considers the

situation)

Her name is Nikki. She holds men's

teeth. She sits at the bar and she

drinks champagne.

BILL

(significantly)

Boys, she's gonna be a lot of

trouble.

NIKKI

Oh, my, my!

SHEP

Poor sweet! She can't even hold her

glass!

NIKKI

(casually)

Oh, well, HE can't either. Besides,

he has to use two hands.

SHEP

Course he can't hold his glass. His

hands are burned.

NIKKI

Burned?

SHEP

You have no right to spill YOUR

drinks. He can't help himself.

NIKKI

Burned? How burned?

SHEP

He brought a plane down on fire.

NIKKI

An airplane? In the war?

SHEP

He held the stick. But his hands

began to slip. Then he held it

inside his arms. He was trying to

bring his rear gunner down alive.

NIKKI

Did he bring him down safe?

SHEP

Well...

SHEP

Brought him down.

NIKKI

Oh, so that's why--?

SHEP

Yes! That's why he can't hold a

glass.

NIKKI

Oh, I'm so ashamed.

SHEP

Now, Cary's had a pretty thin time.

His nerves are tricky. You should

never call attention to his hands.

FRINK

Hi, Cary.

CARY

(unhappily)

Oh, hello, Frink.

FRINK

Hello, Francis. Bill.

FRINK

Shep. Drunk again?

SHEP

Say, don't you know any OTHER

opening remarks? It's about all

we've heard from you for a year.

FRINK

(signals the bartender)

Hi! Jean!

FRINK

Un sidecar.

JEAN

Sidecar ... [?]

FRINK

Say, why don't you fellows go home

and go to work?

SHEP

Work? What kind of work?

FRINK

Oh, anything useful.

BILL

What could we do? Sell washing

machines? Drive a milk wagon? Mend

old furniture or somethin'? Heh!

FRINK

Go back to flying. Fly the air

mails.

BILL

Aw, we couldn't fly a kite.

FRANCIS

Maybe a small kite.

FRINK

Well, there must be something you

can do.

SHEP

We've got to tend to our drinking.

We don't get much opportunity.

FRINK

Lots of things going on outside.

Sun shining, trees growing, people

walking around.

BILL

Say! Is that STILL going on?

SHEP

(laughs)

Sounds pretty pre-war to me.

FRINK

Hey. Don't I rate an introduction?

Who's your swell friend?

SHEP

Oh, her? Just an old hussy we found

scattered around.

SHEP

(off Frink)

Pay no attention. Sometimes he goes

away.

NIKKI

Oh! He didn't go.

NIKKI

Oh, I'm so sorry. Your hands...

NIKKI

Oh, your poor hands! Your poor, poor

hands.

NIKKI

Oh!

SHEP

(more in disbelief

than anger)

If you aren't the WORST! First, you

insult his hands and make him mad.

Then you cry over them and make him

self-conscious. Come on back here.

Come on.

SHEP

Well, that's torn it. He'll never

come back now.

NIKKI

Then we'll have to find him.

SHEP

What for?

NIKKI

To explain how sorry I am.

SHEP

(amused at her

distress)

We-ell. You don't have to get so

emotional about it.

NIKKI

Who's getting emotional?

SHEP

You are. You're coming all apart.

(hands her a glass)

Here. Take a drink of this. Make

you laugh and play.

BILL

(to Shep)

Say, what's she crying about?

SHEP

She's crying on account of they

didn't wash her strawberries this

morning.

BILL

(to Nikki)

Didn't they wash your strawberries

this morning? Well, there ain't a

whole hell of a lot that we can do

about that now.

NIKKI

(agrees, sadly)

No.

SHEP

Let's go.

BILL

Hey! Where're you goin'?!

SHEP

Oh, out.

BILL

(rises)

Out where?!

SHEP (o.s.)

Out to get a drink.

BILL

Don't you suppose you could arrange

that here?!

SHEP

Nope. We gotta go somewheres else.

BILL

(without missing a beat)

Okay. Come on, Francis. We got to go

somewheres else to get a drink.

DISSOLVE TO:

BILL

Hey! There he is!

SHEP

Where?

BILL

Come on!

SHEP (o.s.)

Cary!

BILL

Say, what are you tryin' to do,

disown us?

CARY

(genuinely polite)

Hello. Won't you sit down?

BILL

Sure we'll sit down. What'd ya think

we'd do? Stand around?

BILL

(with a wave, to Frink)

Thank you.

SHEP

Hello, Cary.

CARY

Hello, Shep. Hello, Nikki. What will

you have to drink?

FRANCIS

Martini!

BILL

Martini!

SHEP

Martini!

FRINK

Martini!

WAITER

Quatre Martinis?

NIKKI

Uh, could I have champagne, please?

WAITER

Champagne? Oui.

BILL

Boys, she's goin' to be a problem.

NIKKI

(explains, to Bill)

That's what I started on.

(to Cary)

It upsets me if I change over to

anything else.

CARY

(to Bill)

There's a lot of things wrong with

this one.

(to Nikki)

What were you doing at the bar at

Claridge's anyway?

SHEP

Yes. Don't you know you're not

supposed to be there?

FRANCIS

There's a sign on the wall says

ladies must sit at the back.

NIKKI

Can't read signs.

SHEP

Well, we'll just have to take care

of her, that's all.

BILL

Do you think she's good-lookin'

enough?

NIKKI

Oh, I know I'm not very good-

looking but--

CARY

But what?

NIKKI

But when I was a little girl, my

mother always said I had the nicest

hair-ribbon.

BILL

Then there's her drinking.

NIKKI

What's the matter with my drinking?

BILL

You're a sissy drinker.

NIKKI

Well, maybe I can improve.

BILL

Then there's her teeth. Why, one of

'em is turned sideways.

NIKKI

(points)

You mean this one?

BILL

That's it.

CARY

Why don't you have it turned around?

NIKKI

I don't have it turned around on

account of it's a kind of help.

CARY

Well, in what respect does it kind

of help?

NIKKI

Well, you see, when anyone kisses me

too hard, it splits my lip. And you

could tell when anyone kissed me too

hard on account of my lip would

bleed. So now I don't let anyone

kiss me -- hard.

CARY

Well, we'll let that pass.

NIKKI

Where's he gone?

CARY

Shep went off to sharpen his skates.

BILL

Now, about your nose.

NIKKI

What about my nose?

BILL

It isn't straight. It kind of turns

up at the end.

NIKKI

Well, when I was a little girl, I

got bumped by a swing.

CARY

How'd you happen to get bumped?

NIKKI

I just walked through the gate. I

was only seven.

CARY

Oh, poor dear. Didn't you see it?

NIKKI

I can't see very far.

CARY

Did it hurt?

NIKKI

It made me dizzy all day.

CARY

Well, I guess we can't hold that

against her.

BILL

We all make mistakes.

CARY

That's right. Michelangelo painted

Adam with a navel.

NIKKI

All the same, he'd look funny the

other way -- even in a painting.

NIKKI

Where's he gone?

BILL

He went off to shave a horse.

CARY

Have you got a husband or anything?

NIKKI

No husband.

CARY

A mother?

NIKKI

Mother, yes. But we haven't met in

quite a long time.

CARY

Why not in a long time?

NIKKI

Well, on account of my mother's name

was Beulah. Now, you can't have a

mother named Beulah. So I changed it

to Jane. And that's how it all began.

BILL

He's goin' off to tame an alligator.

NIKKI

Who is he, anyway?

CARY

Francis used to fly with us in the

94th. The best shot in the squadron.

Brought down twelve planes. Used to

call him "Sudden Death." He lost

interest after his teammate got

killed. He's lonesome is all.

NIKKI

I like him.

CARY

He carries a chiming watch on

account of he's always falling

asleep in the daytime.

NIKKI

What kind of chimes?

CARY

Oh, Westminster, Canterbury, and

Whittington.

NIKKI

I'll take vanilla.

BILL

I think he's a washout.

SHEP

Well, just because you're a big

bombardier and an All-American--

NIKKI

(interrupts)

All-American what?

SHEP

Halfback.

FRINK

Where?

CARY

Oh, Montana State or somewhere.

Idaho or Nebraska or the Carlisle

Indians or something. Didn't you

never read about Bill? Bronko Bill

-- the Alabama Flash?

NIKKI

(skeptical)

I think it's a forgery.

BILL

Say! What do you want me to do?

Tackle a horse?

SHEP

Sure. Go ahead. Tackle a horse.

BILL

(with a dismissive wave)

All right, all right, I'll tackle a

horse.

SHEP

Here comes one now.

BILL

Look out, horse!

CARY

Hey, Bill! Bill! Come back here!

NIKKI

(distraught)

Oh, Bill!

CARY

Hey! What's the idea -- runnin'

down my friend like that? Here!

CARY

Never mind. Look where you're going

in the future now. You just watch out

where you're going!

CARY

(admonishes Bill)

Now listen, come on out here, you

old fool.

(to the shying horse)

Whoa, whoa.

BILL

Nice horsie.

CARY

(to Bill)

Now, listen, you ought to be ashamed

of yourself. You old fool! You know

what you'll do? You'll kill yourself

one of these days. Now, come on, get

out of here. Now, listen--

CARY

(to the driver)

You all right now, brother?

CARY

All right. Now, you just keep your

horse, see? You got your money.

CARY

Hey, listen, Bill, you're All-

American, see? You're TWO All-

Americans! The lady's convinced

you're the whole team. You don't

have to tackle any more horses.

How 'bout that? Drink your drink.

BILL

(pleased with himself)

Ahhh. Wasn't that a great spill?

SHEP

Hey! Where are you going?

NIKKI

Would you all excuse me for a

moment?

CARY

Well, where are you going?

NIKKI

(a grave announcement)

To take a Chinese singing lesson.

FRANCIS

Hooray!

MEN

Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

BILL

Hey. What kind of a girl do you

think Nikki is?

CARY

I think she's the kind that sits

down on phonograph records.

FRINK

Say, Nikki, let's ditch these

drunks and go off somewhere by

ourselves. These crazy fools are

liable to do anything.

NIKKI

(hopeful)

Do you think so?

FRINK

Since the war, they don't care what

happens.

NIKKI

And do you?

FRINK

I'll say so. I've got more

important things to think of.

NIKKI

What more important things?

FRINK

Well, my work.

NIKKI

What kind of work?

FRINK

I'm the foreign correspondent for a

New York newspaper syndicate.

NIKKI

(genuinely)

How nice for you!

FRANCIS

Nikki? Are you the kind of girl that

sits down on phonograph records?

NIKKI

(a bit defensively)

People shouldn't leave their records

lying about.

CARY

(to Francis)

What did I tell you?

NIKKI

(abruptly brightens)

Take me dancing?

BILL

What place you wanna go?

NIKKI

What places you got?

CARY

Well, we got Maxim's, only it's too

early. We've got Florida, Perroquet,

Pigalle, Le Rat Mort, Moulin Rouge,

Bal Tabarin.

NIKKI

I'll take vanilla.

BILL

Somebody pay for the drinks!

BILL

We're off in a "billizzard" of

horse-radish!

DISSOLVE TO:

NIKKI

My, my! Isn't this nice?!

BILL

Now, listen, men. I'll tell ya

something funny.

BILL

I was only four years old once.

FRANCIS

(to Cary)

What'd he say?

CARY

Said he was only four years old

once.

FRANCIS

Amazing.

BILL

And my aunt had a very low-neck

dress on.

FRANCIS

(to Cary)

What'd he say?

CARY

Said his aunt had on a very low-neck

dress.

FRANCIS

Can't believe it.

BILL

And she sat right across the table

in front of me. And I said, "Auntie

-- I can see your knees!"

CARY

(pointedly, after

an awkward pause)

I wonder what's doing in Portugal

tonight.

BILL

Maybe I'd better do my match trick.

NIKKI

If you do match tricks, I'll recite.

CARY

Recite what?

NIKKI

Poetry.

CARY

Whose poetry?

NIKKI

My poetry.

CARY

You write poetry?

NIKKI

I'll send you a photograph of my

poetry.

CARY

Say, I wonder if there's anything

intoxicating in that.

DISSOLVE TO:

NIKKI

Just what ARE your plans?

SHEP

You'll have to watch that lad, Nikki.

He's a member of the Wandering Hands

Society and he has a groping good

time.

CARY

Your behavior, sir, is unseemly,

unethical, indelicate and lousy.

Have I made myself clear?

FRINK

All right. My mistake. I'm sorry.

CARY

You'll have to watch out for him,

Nikki. He's just a licentious old

man.

NIKKI

It's getting pretty late, isn't it?

CARY

Do you want to go home, Nikki?

(rises)

I'll take you home. Where do you

live?

NIKKI

Hotel Carlton.

BILL

I'll take her home, too.

FRANCIS

So will I!

SHEP

We'll match to see who takes her

home!

BILL

Nothin' doing! We'll ALL take her

home.

CARY

I saw her first.

BILL

It makes no difference. She belongs

to us all now!

DISSOLVE TO:

BILL

(quietly, to Nikki)

Sh! Let him sleep. What's your

number?

NIKKI

(whispers)

Eighty-eight.

BILL

Here we are. Goin' up!

CARY

Who's gonna pilot this craft?

BILL

I'll take her off. Where's the

throttle?

CARY

Got your safety belts buckled?

SHEP & OTHERS

Mm hmm.

BILL

Here it is. Contact?

SHEP

Contact!

BILL

We're off!

FRANCIS

Shut her off!

CARY

Hold her nose! She's headed for the

hangar!

SHEP

(nervous)

Hey, stop it, will ya?

NIKKI

We've gone an' passed my floor.

BILL

Gone an' passed your floor? I'll fix

that.

SHEP

Put her tail down!

CARY

Bail out, boys! She's gonna crash!

FRANCIS

Wheeeee!

FRINK

(nervous)

Stop it! Stop it!

NIKKI

We've gone an' passed my floor

again.

BILL

Say! How do you stop this thing?

FRINK

That's right, laugh.

CARY

We should've brought our parachutes!

BILL

Get a good hold, Millie. We're off

again.

SHEP

Nothing doing! Let Cary take the

controls. You'll run us through the

roof.

BILL

All right, all right.

CARY

All set?

SHEP

Let her go!

NIKKI

Hurray!

SHEP & FRANCIS

Hurray!

CARY

There we are.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHEP

Say! That's a pilot for ya.

BILL

You deserve a medal.

BILL

All right, come on, men.

FRANCIS

I need a rest, I need a rest.

BILL

Come on, come on.

NIKKI

Right here.

CARY

Oh! Eighty-eight! Here we are!

SHEP

Wheeeee!

BILL

Well, for--! Well, I'll be a--!

Look! Nikki's got a whole apartment!

SHEP

And a gramophone!

CARY

(unimpressed)

Yeah! And chairs and tables and

floors and ceilings and everything.

FRANCIS

So THIS is where Nikki lives!

NIKKI

Yes, this is where Nikki lives.

SHEP

And she's got a book!

FRANCIS

Got all the comforts of home.

BILL

Hey! Look at all the bottles!

BILL

Hey! Come on in and look at Nikki's

bottles!

BILL

Ylang! Ylang!

CARY

Hey, don't be handlin' her things.

Put 'em down.

BILL

Chichi!

CARY

Leave 'em alone.

BILL

Salammbo! Chypre! Reve de Vestale!

Jinko!

SHEP

Hey, you big bombardier--

BILL

Chiki chiki!

FRANCIS

Say, I never saw so many shoes.

BILL

Look!

BILL

She never winds her clock!

(picks up the clock)

It says eleven and I've never been

anywheres at eleven.

CARY

(dry, to Bill)

What time are you anywhere?

BILL

(to Cary, ignoring Nikki)

Two o'clock. It's always two o'clock

in my life. Hey, listen. Besides

never having any matches and always

spilling her drinks, she never winds

her clock! Think I'll go in the

bathroom and see if she leaves the

cap off her tooth paste.

BILL

Is it all right?

NIKKI

Help yourself.

NIKKI

(friendly, sympathetic)

Hello.

CARY

(grins)

Hello, yourself.

BILL (o.s.)

(excited)

TURTLES!

CARY

Turtles?

SHEP (o.s.)

Turtles?

BILL

Turtles!

OTHERS

Turtles?!

SHEP

(thrilled)

It IS turtles!

FRANCIS

Hey! Look, Cary! It's turtles!

CARY

(with a nod)

Nice work, boys. It's turtles.

NIKKI

And now do you suppose you could

all excuse me?

NIKKI

On account of I'd like to go to bed.

CARY

Sure we'll excuse you. I'll clear

everybody out of here.

(to the others)

Come on, you fellas. Nikki wants to

go to bed.

BILL

Go to bed?

SHEP

Awww! Bed?

BILL

Yup, all right.

SHEP

(waves to the turtles)

So long, turtles.

BILL

Good night, turtles.

FRANCIS

Night, turtles.

BILL

Poor Nikki. Do you wanna go to

sleep?

NIKKI

(nods)

Mm hm.

SHEP

Sleep? You should NEVER go to sleep!

BILL

(with a wave, to Nikki)

Well, good night.

SHEP

(with a wave)

Nighty-night, Nikki.

FRINK

Good night, Nikki.

BILL

(satisfied)

Ah!

NIKKI

(dead serious)

Good night, Cary.

CARY

(playful)

Good night, Nikki.

BILL

Say! I like this place.

FRANCIS

Say, I like this place, too.

SHEP

I think it's swell.

FRINK (o.s.)

It suits me.

CARY

You fellas think you're gonna PARK

here?

BILL (o.s.)

Sure!

FRANCIS (o.s.)

Sure.

NIKKI

(innocently)

Will somebody please scrub my back?

BILL

Will somebody scrub your back?! Look

out, boys!

BILL

I got it, I got it, I got it.

BILL

(impressed)

Mmmmmm mm!

NIKKI

Scrub hard.

BILL

Did anyone ever see such a back in

their life?

BILL

Did anyone ever HEAR of such a

thing?

BILL (o.s.)

Just look at that back. Just look at

that thing, won't you?

NIKKI

Harder.

BILL

My, my!

BILL

I could go on doin' this a long time.

CARY

Nikki? Are you rich?

NIKKI

Well, practically. Beulah is rich.

CARY

Well, just how rich IS your mother?

NIKKI

Leave a lady a few secrets, can't

you?

NIKKI

Thank you, William. That was EVER so

cool and nice.

(takes bottle and

towels from him)

Good night.

BILL

Good night.

NIKKI

(to the others)

Good night.

THE MEN

Good night, Nikki.

BILL

Come on, fellas!

CARY

You're gonna stay here, huh?

BILL

(to Cary)

That's right! She might need some

more help!

FADE OUT

BARTENDER

Messieurs.

SHEP

Morning.

FRANCIS

Morning.

BILL

Um, prairie oyster.

SHEP

Prairie oyster.

FRANCIS

Prairie oyster.

BARTENDER

Prairie oyster for three.

SHEP

Say, we'd better get back to our

hotel.

FRANCIS

There's no Nikki at our hotel.

BILL

That's right.

SHEP

And the bar doesn't open so early.

BILL

Say! Why don't we move in here?

FRANCIS

Sure. Let's stay here.

BILL

But - what about Cary?

FRANCIS

(to Shep)

What about Cary?

SHEP

(to Francis)

What ABOUT Cary?

BILL

We can move him in, too.

SHEP

Not a bad idea!

BILL

(cheerfully)

Well, come on, men. Let's go.

FADE OUT

NIKKI

(wearily)

Entrez!

BILL

Hi, Nik!

SHEP

Hello, Nikki!

FRANCIS

(in mid-yawn)

Hello.

CARY

Good morning, Nikki.

NIKKI (o.s.)

Hello, Bill. Hello, Shep. Hello,

Cary. Hello, Francis.

FRANCIS

(from the sofa)

Morning, Nikki.

NIKKI

I didn't expect to see you all so

early.

BILL

We camped on your doorsteps last

night. And this morning we all moved

in.

CARY

Despite your practically innumerable

faults, we adore you. We've decided

to adopt you.

BILL

Well, for heaven's sakes! Look at

Nikki! What are you having done to

yourself, gal?

SHEP

Whatcha having your toes painted

for, Nikki?

NIKKI

I don't know.

(looks at Bill and Shep)

Seemed like a good idea at the time.

BILL

Why, look at Nikki's legs, would

you? That there is practically the

loveliest pair of legs I ever saw in

all my born days.

NIKKI

Like my legs?

SHEP

Look at those legs, Cary. My, they

nearly match.

SHEP

Did you ever see such a swell set of

legs?

CARY

Well, what do you want me to do

about it? Burst into tears?

SHEP

Would it embarrass you, Nikki, if

Cary were to burst into tears?

NIKKI

(looks at her legs)

On account of my legs? Oh!

(turns to Cary,

heartfelt)

I think that would be sweet.

SHEP

Oh, boy! Here come the drinks!

SHEP

Here, Nikki, drink this.

CARY

Make you laugh and play.

NIKKI

That's what I want to do, laugh and

play.

BILL

Here's to Nikki's dainty legs. As

smooth and hairless as an egg.

SHEP

Wheee!

CARY

Hurray!

NIKKI

'Ray!

CARY

Well! Here comes that licentious

old man. Who invited him?

FRINK

(sneering)

Still drinking?

CARY

(shakes his head

mockingly)

How can you tell?

FRINK

Morning, Nikki.

NIKKI

Oh, it's you.

(after a pause,

reluctantly polite)

Won't you sit down?

FRINK

Thank you.

SHEP

Say, I don't think Nikki likes you.

FRINK

Oh, no?

SHEP

No. What do you wanna hang around

for?

FRINK

Well, what do YOU hang around for?

SHEP

Me? Why, I came to bring Nikki some

posies. I'll bet you didn't bring

Nikki any posies.

FRINK

I-- Well--

BILL

Have a drink?

FRINK

No, thanks.

SHEP

Cure the shakes.

FRINK

I haven't got the shakes.

CARY

Let's see. Hold out your hands.

CARY

No, turn them over.

CARY

Say, that's pretty good.

CARY

Let's see if you can hold this.

CARY

Say, that's great.

CARY

Steady as a rock!

CARY

Well, I guess that'll keep his hands

out of mischief for a while.

FRINK

Hey. Take these off.

CARY

Now, let's see. Where were we before

we were so rudely interrupted?

BILL

We were talkin' about Nikki's legs.

CARY

That's right. We were talkin' about

Nikki's legs. And havin' a fine time,

too.

WOMAN

Finis.

SHEP

Let's inspect the job.

NIKKI

Oh, my poor toes. Don't look too

close.

CARY

Well, what's the matter with your

toes?

NIKKI

Well... when I was a little girl...

NIKKI

... my mother bought me a new pair

of shoes. ... And they were WAY too

short. ...

NIKKI

... And I had to walk all the way to

Sunday school and back. ... Down the

road. ... And it was hot and dusty.

BILL

(hand to his face)

Oh, take her away! She's breakin'

my heart!

(sobs)

NIKKI

And when I got home ...  my toes

were spoiled.

CARY

(on the verge of tears)

Oh, dear, oh, dear.

SHEP

That's such a sad story. Let's all

have a drink, quick!

NIKKI

And now would you all excuse me?

On account of I'm gonna put on a

dress.

CARY

Well, why not?

SHEP

My, my. What's HE getting so excited

about?

FRINK

You guys think you're so darn smart.

CARY

Well, cheerio, fellas. I'm off.

CARY

See ya later.

NIKKI (o.s.)

What are the plans for the day?

SHEP

Well, on account of it's raining and

everything, we thought we'd go over

to the Cluny and play billiards and

drink beer.

NIKKI (o.s.)

How about Cary?

SHEP

Went to get his hat and coat. He's

going to Pere Lachaise.

NIKKI (o.s.)

Pere Lachaise? What's Pere Lachaise?

SHEP

A cemetery. How 'bout you coming

with us?

NIKKI (o.s.)

No. I'm going with Cary.

SHEP

(concerned)

You've been invited?

NIKKI

Do you think Cary might object?

SHEP

Well, I have an idea he'd like to be

alone.

NIKKI

Why alone?

SHEP

Well, Cary likes to be alone. He's

as brittle as a breadstick. One

silly crack from you and he might

break up in sections.

NIKKI

(thinks about this)

Well, then, I don't think he should

be left alone.

(beat)

Tell me, what's Cary doing in Paris?

SHEP

What are we all doing in Paris?

NIKKI

I know. But why doesn't he go home?

SHEP

Well, he's not ready to go home.

What could he do if he went home?

Have people cry over his hands?

NIKKI

Well, it seems - a pity to go on

like this. He's such a sweet soul.

SHEP

One of the best.

NIKKI

Isn't he just sort of wasting

himself?

SHEP

On the contrary. He's trying awfully

hard to get hold of himself.

SHEP

Now, listen. If you tag along, for

heaven's sake, be careful what you

say. Don't start getting sorry for

him and don't cry over him.

(with a chuckle)

And, above all, don't make any

unfortunate remarks, hear?

NIKKI

(earnest)

Oh, I won't. Why, who ever heard of

such a thing?

NIKKI

Cary?! Cary? I'm coming with you.

NIKKI

Oooh!

(to Cary)

Ooh, wait for Nikki!

NIKKI

(calls back to Cary)

Wait for Nikki!

SHEP

What are you changing your shoes

for?

NIKKI

On account of I can walk faster in

red shoes.

FADE OUT

CARY

(to Nikki)

Perhaps we'd better stay here a

while till it clears up.

NIKKI

Could we sit down here, do you

suppose?

CARY

I think so. Would you like something

to drink?

NIKKI

What should I drink now, do you

suppose?

CARY

(to the waiter)

Deux picon citrons.

NIKKI

Picon citrons?

CARY

Very refreshing. Make you laugh and

play.

NIKKI

(amused)

That's what you always promise.

(suddenly serious)

Cary, why does Shep Lambert go on

drinking so desperately?

CARY

Don't we all?

NIKKI

Not like Shep.

CARY

Well, Shep has that tic under his

eye, you know. Takes a lot of drinks

to keep that quiet.

NIKKI

But isn't there some kind of

treatment or something?

CARY

Shep could never stand a long course

of treatment. Drinking's the only

corrective so far as he's concerned.

He's found out the tic doesn't work

when he's tight. So he stays tight.

NIKKI

Seems such a pity. How did he get

the tic?

CARY

In the war.

NIKKI

I know. But how?

CARY

Well, it's not very romantic.

NIKKI

Well, don't tell me if you don't

want to.

CARY

Well, you see, a tic is a nervous

habit.

NIKKI

Yes?

CARY

Lice under his bandages.

NIKKI

Oh.

CARY

He had the devil of a time. He

nearly lost his mind. So you'll have

to excuse him a little.

NIKKI

I'm so sorry for Shep.

CARY

Well, don't let him know it.

NIKKI

Well, isn't he going home? Not ever?

CARY

Not ever. Not in his dark glasses

anyway.

NIKKI

Can't something be done for him?

CARY

He'll have to be - reborn.

NIKKI

How's he going to end?

CARY

Well, how are you going to end? How

am I going to end? How is ANYONE

going to end? How's your picon

citron go?

NIKKI

It goes fine. But doesn't ANYTHING

make any difference to you?

CARY

Not now. A long time ago, perhaps,

when I was a little boy.

NIKKI

Tell me, where were you little?

CARY

In Minnesota. On a farm.

NIKKI

Were you happy then, Cary?

CARY

I think so.

NIKKI

Tell me, what WAS there to be happy

about on a farm in Minnesota?

CARY

(lost in thought)

Ohhh, thorn-apple trees in blossom.

The smell of burning leaves in the

fall. The sound of horses' hoofs on

the road.

(looks at Nikki)

Did you ever dig up an Indian mound

or uncover a nest of baby field

mice? Or explore old trunks in an

attic? Listen to the moaning of the

telephone wires in the winter wind?

See a gypsy caravan?

NIKKI

(enthralled)

So THAT'S why you were happy. On

account of apple blossoms and field

mice and telephone wires and gypsy

caravans and old trunks and things?

CARY

That's right.

NIKKI

But aren't you going back? Not ever?

CARY

Would you like another picon citron

before you go? The rain is lifting.

NIKKI

No. I'm ready now.

DISSOLVE TO:

NIKKI

Who all is buried here?

CARY

Oh, poets, painters, philosophers--

NIKKI

Cocoanut?

CARY

No cocoanut. Poets, painters,

philosophers, musicians.

CARY

There's Chopin.

NIKKI

Oh, I practiced him.

CARY

And there's Balzac. And there's

Heloise and Abelard.

NIKKI

Oh, tell me about Abelise and

Eloard.

CARY

No, Nikki. Not Abelise and Eloard.

Heloise and Abelard.

NIKKI

I'm sorry. I really didn't do it on

purpose. It was on account of the

picon citron. Tell me about Heloise

and Abelard.

CARY

Well, they're buried here in the

same sepulchre side by side.

NIKKI

Why are they buried side by side?

CARY

They were the world's most famous

lovers.

(looks off, points

with his cane)

There's the tomb.

NIKKI

Tell me about the world's most

famous lovers.

CARY

Well, Abelard was a scholastic

philosopher--

NIKKI

Whatever that is.

CARY

Whatever that is. He gained a

footing in a certain household as

tutor to a maiden called Heloise.

And employed his unlimited

opportunities for the purpose of--

Well, betrayal. Not, however,

unmixed with real love. He carried

her off to Brittany.

NIKKI

Tell me more.

CARY

Well, her uncle was furious. He

blamed Abelard for the whole thing.

He conceived a terrible revenge.

NIKKI

(uneasy)

I'm afraid for Abelard.

CARY

He broke into Abelard's apartment

one night and perpetrated upon him

the most brutal punishment.

NIKKI

Oh, dear.

CARY

The lovers were forced to live

their lives apart. But when they

died, they were buried here side by

side.

(peers down at

the ground)

There's a story that little heart-

shaped stones are supposed to grow

around the tomb.

NIKKI

Heart-shaped stones?

CARY

And lovers come and find them and

exchange them with each other.

(looks at Nikki)

And, so long as you keep the stone

from the tomb of Heloise and Abelard,

no harm can come to your true love.

NIKKI

How perfectly beautiful.

CARY

Isn't that a quaint legend?

NIKKI

Do you think I might find a heart-

shaped stone? You help me, Cary.

CARY

All right, Nikki. Only we have to

leave soon.

(looks off)

They close up the place.

NIKKI

Just as soon as we find our stones.

NIKKI

I found one! Where's yours?

NIKKI

And, now, you take mine. And I'll

take yours.

NIKKI

Isn't that the way the story goes?

CARY

That's right, Nikki.

NIKKI

And, now, no harm can come to our

true love.

CARY

(amused)

And, now, we'll have to go.

NIKKI

You were so nice to let me come

with you. I spoiled your whole day.

You were going to do something else,

weren't you?

CARY

(looks away)

Doesn't matter.

NIKKI

Well, what was it, Cary? Why did you

come here today?

CARY

(not looking at her)

To pay my respects to an old comrade.

NIKKI

Oh. And you wanted to be alone. I'm

sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry.

(begins to weep softly)

Don't pay any attention to me, Cary.

I can't help it. You MAKE me cry.

NIKKI

Oh, don't look so troubled, Cary.

I'm all right. I just want to cry

for a minute.

(puts a hand on

his shoulder)

On account of you're so nice. You're

so clean, Cary. And your teeth are

so white. You're so civilized. You

don't care about anything any more,

nor anybody. Nothing makes any

difference to you. Nothing can

touch you.

(realizes)

Why, you're lost. You're ALL lost.

You and Shep and the rest of you.

(takes his hand)

Oh, I want to do something for you.

I want to help you.

(looks at his wrist)

Let me wash your bracelet, Cary.

(points)

Why, see? The silver's all

tarnished. The silver's all

tarnished.

(removes his bracelet)

I'll take it with me and scrub it

when I get home. I'll polish it

with my nail-brush.

CARY

It's getting dark.

NIKKI

Well ...

(rises, cheerily)

Anyway, we found a name for my

turtles!

CARY

Heloise and Abelard? A name for

your turtles? So that's what you

were looking for. I might have

known how it would end.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHEP

Hi, Nik.

NIKKI

(sadly)

Hello.

SHEP

Cary's in a state. Says he's going

away. Can't stand it any longer and

all that sort of thing.

(sits on the bed)

What happened between you two,

anyway?

NIKKI

Cary seemed so sad and everything --

on account of I'd taken up his whole

afternoon.

(sighs)

So little Nikki said, all merry and

bright, "Well, anyway, we'd found a

name for my turtles."

SHEP

A name for the turtles?

SHEP

That's funny!

SHEP

Name for the turtles! That's so

funny, all right!

SHEP

Why do you always HAVE to be funny

at the wrong time? Didn't I tell you

Cary was brittle? How did he respond

to THAT line?

NIKKI

(morosely)

Pulled down the iron curtain.

NIKKI

Did he say he was going away?

SHEP

(through his laughter)

Yup. Gotta get away from it all.

NIKKI

Then, you've got to go to him right

now!

NIKKI

And explain that I didn't mean

it! Tell him how it was and

everything!

SHEP

Listen--

NIKKI

No, go on. You go right now before

it's too late!

SHEP

But Nikki--!

NIKKI

You go right straight to Cary.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHEP

Now, listen, Cary, you don't have to

behave like an old Easter egg.

You're breaking Nikki's heart. She

doesn't know any better.

CARY

She doesn't know any better? Well,

whether she does or not, I'm going

a long ways away from Nikki. Nikki

and her turtles.

SHEP

Whew! You sure are in an uproar.

What YOU need is a drink!

CARY

I need more than a drink. I need a

lot of geography between me and that

girl.

SHEP

Where do you want to go?

CARY

Anywheres. So long as it's a long

way from Nikki.

(pauses, looks at Shep)

You know -- that girl does things to

me.

(back to packing)

I've got to get away.

SHEP

Well, I wonder what's happening in

Portugal tonight.

CARY

Say ...

(thinks it over)

I wonder what IS happening in

Portugal tonight.

DISSOLVE TO:

BILL AND SHEP

Heave ho!

BILL

Ah! There you go.

NIKKI

If Cary's going to Portugal, why

can't we go to Portugal, too? Ain't

we got any rights?

BILL

Sure we got rights!

SHEP

Cary better not think he can screw

up in Portugal and leave old Shep

behind.

FRINK

Say, when's he leaving?

SHEP

Ten-thirty in the morning. Sud

Express.

NIKKI

Don't we have to have passports and

things?

SHEP

Sure we gotta have passports!

BILL

What kind passports you like?

NIKKI

What kind passports you got?

BILL

We have ebony, cocoanut,

thornberry passports.

NIKKI

(grandly)

I'll take vanilla.

FRINK

Good night, Nikki. I'll see you on

the train.

NIKKI

You're goin', too?

FRINK

Why not?

(with a sly smile)

I might, uh, pick up a couple of

features for my paper - in

Portugal.

SHEP

Nikki, do you want --?

NIKKI

Did you put all my shoes in?

BILL

You bet. There they are--

SHEP

I don't know how you're going to get

all these dresses in, Nikki.

DISSOLVE TO:

NIKKI

Don't we have to go like anything?

The train leaves in twenty minutes.

BILL

Are you SURE you have everything?

NIKKI

(misses the irony)

I - I think so.

FRANCIS

(dryly)

Hardly seems enough.

NIKKI

Oh, my turtles! My turtles!

BILL

Here you are, Francis! You're the

custodian of the turtles! Now don't

fall down on the job.

FRANCIS

Hey! I never tended turtles before.

NIKKI

Now, all you have to do -

NIKKI

- is to sprinkle 'em now and then, like

this.

FRANCIS

Oh, yeah. I see.

NIKKI

Well, we're off.

(to a bellhop,

about the trunk)

Be careful of that one.

BILL

Uh, come on, Francis! Take those

turtles!

FADE OUT

BILL

There she is, boys! The Sud Express!

SHEP

Can you imagine Cary tryin' to run

away and leave us behind?

NIKKI

Do you suppose he's really gonna

be here?

BILL

Sure he'll be here. He's never

missed a train in his life.

FRANCIS

Say, do you suppose the turtles'll

be all right with that porter?

BILL

Aw, sure they'll be all right. All

you got to do is -

(gestures with his hand)

- sprinkle 'em!

NIKKI

There he is!

BILL (o.s.)

Say, Cary!

NIKKI

Hello, Cary.

CARY

(surprised)

Well, hello. What are you all doing

down here?

BILL

We just came down to see you off is

all.

CARY

Well, that's darn decent of you.

FRANCIS

Ya got a nice seat?

CARY

Yeah, right by a window.

NIKKI

Oh, how nice for you!

BILL

(with childlike desire)

Come on! Show us your seat by the

window!

SHEP

(cheerful, insistent)

Yeah, come on, Cary! We wanna SEE

that seat by the window.

FRANCIS

Come on, Nikki.

BILL

My, my, what a swell train.

SHEP

Sud Express, Train de Luxe. Say,

I wonder if a chap can get a drink

on this train.

BILL

Sure! I don't see why not. Push the

button.

CARY

(flustered)

Well, I'm afraid you won't have time

for a drink. We're gonna start in a

minute. You'll have to get off.

BILL

Get off?! Gosh, no. We LIKE this

train!

FRANCIS

This is a Train de Luxe.

SHEP

Yes, we like trains de luxe, don't we,

Nikki?

NIKKI

Sure! Trains de luxe is what we like.

CARY

Hey! He's blowing the whistle.

(grabs Shep's shoulder)

Hey, we're gonna start.

SHEP

Well, let her start.

BILL

Let 'er go Gallagher. Who cares?!

FRANCIS

Who cares?!

SHEP

Who cares?!

NIKKI

Who cares?!

FRINK

Hello, everybody.

CARY

And you, too?

FRINK

That's right.

CARY

That's right. Who cares?

NIKKI

Goodbye! Goodbye! Don't forget to

write!

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

BILL

Hi, men! Look what I found.

SHEP

Come in.

FRANCIS

Sit down.

CARY

Have a drink.

GENTLEMAN

Ah, thank you, no, not I.

GENTLEMAN

I - I say, are you all going to

Portugal?

SHEP

Yup. We're going down there to

investigate conditions.

GENTLEMAN

Investigate conditions?

BILL

Drinking conditions, mostly.

SHEP

By the way, what ARE conditions?

GENTLEMAN

Don't you know what conditions are?

SHEP

No. Never saw one in my life.

BILL

The drinking conditions are pretty

bad right here.

GENTLEMAN

(chuckles skeptically,

glancing at the bottles)

Ahh, indeed.

BILL

My beer's full of cinders.

CARY

Good for ya. Make ya lay hard-shelled

eggs.

CARY

Nikki? The man says your

compartment's ready.

NIKKI

I'm glad -- on account of it's been

so hot and I'm so tired and I want

to go to bed.

SHEP

Going to bed? Who ever heard of such

a thing?

BILL

Can we help you undress?

NIKKI

No, thank you, William.

FRANCIS

Take off your shoes?

SHEP

Undo your hair?

BILL

Scrub your back or something?

NIKKI

No, I can manage quite well by

myself. Good night, everybody.

FRINK

Good night, Nikki.

CARY

Can you imagine that ungrateful old

trollop? She wouldn't let them help

her undress.

GENTLEMAN

Can't understand it at all.

CARY

You know, she's not very pretty. But

when she was a little girl, her

mother always said she had the nicest

hair-ribbons.

GENTLEMAN

Indeed?

CARY

She got one tooth turned around, she

can't see very far, and she's ALWAYS

speaking out of turn. Otherwise,

she's a mighty fine piece of

architecture.

GENTLEMAN

Mm, seems to need a few repairs.

SHEP

She's got eyes like an Assyrian

Queen's got eyes.

BILL

You ain't never seen no Assyrian

Queen! You're just a-makin' that up

outta yore own head!

SHEP

I did SO see an Assyrian Queen.

CARY

In whose green hat?

SHEP

In the Metropolitan Museum's green

hat, that's whose green hat.

CARY

Hold on there! Where you goin'?

SHEP

You're not going anywhere. You're on

a train.

FRANCIS

Sorry.

SHEP

You go back to your turtles, hear?

You've been neglecting your

assignment.

FRANCIS

I have to sprinkle the turtles, see?

GENTLEMAN

Sprinkle the turtles?

FRANCIS

Sure.

FRANCIS

Cool 'em off.

GENTLEMAN

Hm?

FRANCIS

Turtles get feverish on trains.

GENTLEMAN

Ahh! Uh huh.

NIKKI'S VOICE

Cary!

FRANCIS

What's that?

GENTLEMAN

Hm?

CARY

Nikki!

NIKKI'S VOICE

Cary! Bill! Shep!

NIKKI

Cary!

FRANCIS

Say!

FRINK

Get out of here!

CARY

Say, what's the idea?

FRINK

What's the idea? Well, what business

is that of yours?

CARY

Nikki, you all right? What is this

tough trying to do to you anyway?

NIKKI

Well, I was just going to bed and he

came in and flang himself all over

me.

CARY

Frink, you'd better get out of here

right away before something happens

to you.

FRINK

What right have you to tell me to

get out of here? This isn't your

compartment, is it?

CARY

Oh, I see. You wanna argue about it.

If you don't clear out of here right

now, you're liable to get hurt.

FRINK

All right. Suppose you put me out.

BILL

(savagely)

Put him out? I'll snap his spine and

throw him off the train!

CARY

Hold everything, Bill!

NIKKI

Oh, dear, does everybody have to act

like this?

FRINK

I'm not gonna let these silly drunks

tell ME where to get off.

SHEP

Silly drunks?!

CARY

Silly drunks, did you say?

FRINK

Yes. And that goes for the whole

bunch of you.

BILL

Let me have him.

CARY

(to Bill)

Wait a minute. I'll take care of

him.

FRINK

You will, eh?

SHEP

Socko!

NIKKI

Oh, dear!

BILL

Mm! Now, ain't that nice? Have you

ever seen anything so cute?

CARY

Will you be all right now, Nikki?

NIKKI

(unsure)

Uh huh.

CARY

(to Bill and Shep)

Grab hold of that fella and drag him

out of here.

BILL

Come to papa.

CUT TO:

CARY

Here, Francis. Do your stuff.

CARY

Frink, don't you know better than

to try a stunt like that?

FRINK

Oh, I - I lost my head over the

girl is all. I'm sorry. I apologize.

CARY

Well, you apologize to Nikki in the

morning. And don't you ever get out

CARY

Wake up, ya big sissy.

(pours a drink)

Here, drink this. It'll make you

laugh and play like any old thing.

SHEP

Say, Cary, what day is this?

CARY

It's Wednesday.

SHEP

Wednesday? Wednesday what?

CARY

The twentieth.

SHEP

What month, I mean?

CARY

You mean to say you don't know what

month this is?

SHEP

I knew once but I forgot.

CARY

Well, it's June. The merry month of

June.

SHEP

June? Say, maybe I better get up.

SHEP

What town are we in?

CARY

You're in Lisbon, Portugal.

SHEP

Lisbon. That's where I thought it

was. I just wanted to check up is

all.

CARY

(a little concerned)

Say, what's the matter with you,

Shep? Don't you really know where

you are or what day it is?

SHEP

I kind of lose track of things.

CARY

Say, this is getting serious.

SHEP

Serious? Is anything serious any

more?

CARY

Well, it's serious when you don't

know where you're at. What's gonna

become of you?

SHEP

Oh, I'll be all right when I've had

a couple of drinks. Say, what town

did you say this was?

CARY

I just told you, Lisbon. Come on,

now, pull yourself together, Shep.

We gotta get organized for the

bull-fight.

SHEP

(like a little kid)

Bull-fight? Are we going to a

bull-fight?

CARY

Sure. A Portuguese bull-fight.

SHEP

Is that guy Frink coming along?

CARY

'Fraid so.

SHEP

Gee, isn't there any way we can get

rid of that guy?

CARY

Somebody'll have to shoot him.

SHEP

Not a bad idea at that.

DISSOLVE TO:

BILL

Praca de Touros!

BILL

I wonder if there's a bar inside or

anything.

PEDRO

Sure, there IS a bar.

SHEP

Let's find the bar. We gotta get

organized for the bull-fight.

PEDRO

Right this way.

DISSOLVE TO

BILL

Oh, boy! Lookit that bar, would ya?

Isn't that a beautiful thing?

CARY

What are you all gonna have?

SHEP

Beer is what I want.

BILL

Beer.

FRINK

Beer.

FRANCIS

Beer.

PEDRO

(orders)

Cinco cervejas.

BARTENDER

Cinco cervejas.

NIKKI

I don't like beer.

CARY

Make you leap like a tuna.

NIKKI

Don't wanna leap like a tuna.

CARY

Make you bark like a fox.

NIKKI

Don't wanna bark like a fox.

CARY

Make you laugh and play.

NIKKI

That's what I wanna do! Laugh and

play!

CARY

(to the bartender)

Hey! Vermouth!

BILL

Well, men, fire and fall back!

BILL

Hey! What's the idea?

BILL

Well, I hope I don't catch a cold

in my left ear.

CARY

Hey, drink your drinks! We'll miss

the parade!

CUT TO:

BILL

Well! My old pal!

CARY

Nikki, here's a present for you.

NIKKI

Oh, a hat!

PEDRO

Oh, senor, no, no, no -- you must

not keep the hat. You must put a

little present in it and return it

to the matador after the fight.

CARY

What kind of present?

PEDRO

Well, eh - a little jewelry.

Something you have like the chain or

the watch or the - the - the

cigarette case or the cuff links or

- or the--

CARY

Vanilla?

PEDRO

Yes! Vanilla!

BILL

Look! Here he comes!

PEDRO

Nice work! Good work.

BILL

What's so good about it?

PEDRO

He works close to the bull.

BILL

Is that so dangerous?

PEDRO

Sure, it's dangerous. Bull-fighting

is very dangerous. It takes a lot of

courage to go into the bull ring.

CARY

Is it true the bull is blind when he

charges?

PEDRO

He sees only the cape -- perhaps.

BILL

Bet I could run that bull bow-legged.

You know, I should have BEEN a

bull-fighter.

PEDRO

You should have started at twelve

years of old.

BILL

I bet I could start right now.

CARY

(puts a hand on

Bill's shoulder)

Sit still and behave yourself.

PEDRO

Bull-fighting is not for Americans.

BILL

You think we haven't got the nerve

or something?

PEDRO

Why, listen, bull-fighting is just

for us, the Latins.

BILL

He thinks we're a-scared!

NIKKI

(helpfully)

He tackled a horse once.

PEDRO

(stares at Bill)

Tackle a horse?

PEDRO

(turns away; flatly)

Is not the same!

BILL

Nice work, Tony! Nice work, Joe!

CARY'S VOICE

Hey!

CARY

Bill! Come back here!

CARY

Bill!

CARY

Take it easy! Take it easy!

DISSOLVE TO:

BILL

Cary? I slipped.

CARY

Too bad. You were doing fine.

BILL

Wasn't I, though? Heh. It's a cinch.

Bull-fighting? Just as easy--

BILL

Hey, Doc?! Be careful. What are you

doing?

BILL

You know why I slipped, Cary?

CARY

No, Bill. Why?

BILL

On account of that beer in my shoe.

BILL

Hey, Doc!

BILL

Cary, that bull certainly was

hostile.

SHEP

You hurt, Bill?

NIKKI

You all right, Bill?

BILL

Sure. I'm all right. I was a big

success.

PEDRO

He wants that we should go right

away.

BILL

I'm sure glad that I - I wore my new

blue shorts. I'll be a big success

in the hospital.

NIKKI

I'll send you my turtles, Bill. And

THEN you'll be a big success.

SHEP

So long, Bill.

BILL

So long.

CARY

Goodbye, Bill.

BILL

See ya later - Cary.

CUT TO:

FRANCIS

How is he?

CARY

They've just put him to sleep.

CARY

Why, thank you, Nikki. There's

nothing you can do. You'd better go

back to the hotel.

(to Francis)

Put Nikki in a taxi. We'll wait here.

PEDRO

Senor, the reporters want to know

why your friend descend into the

bull ring.

CARY

Tell them -- that it seemed like a

good idea - at the time.

FADE OUT

CARY

Sounds like old times.

SHEP

Let's go and shoot.

CARY

Not a bad idea.

(to Nikki)

What say, Annie Oakley? Like to

fire off a gun at something?

NIKKI

No objection.

SHEP

(to their bartender)

We'll be right back. Hold

everything.

SHEP

First one to miss pays for the drinks.

CARY

What'll we shoot at?

NIKKI

Shoot one of those pussycats and see

what happens.

SHEP

All right. Look out, pussycat.

SHEP

Well, that's what I was aiming at,

a clay pipe.

(stares in amazement)

Whole thing's been misrepresented

to me.

NIKKI

Cary, let's see you shoot something.

CARY

Look out, ball!

NIKKI

What'd YOU aim at?

CARY

Well, let's see you shoot something.

CARY

Oh, no, no, no, Nikki.

NIKKI

How do you hold it still?

CARY

Listen, Nikki, on your right

shoulder. Now, put your hand out

there and hold up-- No, don't cover

up the site. No, no, no, that's

right. Now just hold it evenly--

CARY

You can do better than that. Show

him up.

FRINK

What are you waving at, Nikki?

CARY

(angry)

Look out! Why, you fool. Don't you

know better than that?

FRINK

What's the idea?

CARY

Pointing a loaded gun at Nikki?

FRINK

Take your hands off me.

CARY

Put down that gun!

FRINK

Let go of my wrist!

CARY

Put down that gun!

FRINK

Listen, you keep your hands off me!

I've had enough from you! You try

any more of your rough stuff on

me--!

CARY

Oh, so that's how it is. I thought

we taught you how to behave.

FRINK

You taught ME how to behave?! Listen,

you'd better behave now or you'll

get hurt!

CARY

(calmly)

I don't think so. I'll give you

three to put down that gun. It'll be

just too bad if you don't.

FRINK

Too bad for who?!

CARY

One ...

FRINK

Keep away from me! I'll shoot, I

tell ya! I'll shoot!

CARY

Two ...

FRINK

I'll shoot! I'll shoot!

CARY'S VOICE

Francis?

CARY

Francis?

FRANCIS

Goodbye, Cary.

FRANCIS

Shep. Nikki.

CARY

We've got to get out of here. Come

on, Shep. Come on.

CARY

That's the last of Francis, I'm

afraid. We'll never see him again.

NIKKI

Did you notice his eyes? That's the

first time I ever saw Francis really

happy. What'll happen to him, do you

suppose?

CARY

Don't worry about, Francis. He'll

take care of himself. Let's get out

of here. Let's walk.

SHEP

No. Don't want to walk. Let's take

a cab.

DISSOLVE TO

CARY

Did you see the way Francis poured

lead into that fellow?

SHEP

Fast work.

CARY

Fast? Chain lightning!

SHEP

Nice shooting.

CARY

Those slugs went right past my ear.

If I'd've moved an inch, I would've

caught one of them myself.

SHEP

"Sudden Death," all right.

CARY

What's the matter with you, Shep?

I've never known you so quiet

before.

SHEP

That's right. I am kind of quiet.

NIKKI

(holds her unlit

cigarette)

Not smoking?

SHEP

No.

NIKKI

Your lighter working?

SHEP

Good ol', Nikki -- never has any

matches.

NIKKI

No.

SHEP

Sure you want a light?

NIKKI

That's what I want, a light.

NIKKI

Shep. Shep!

CARY

What is it?

NIKKI

Shep's hurt!

SHEP

It's a forgery.

NIKKI

Do something for him, Cary! Oh,

Shepard!

CARY

He's been shot!

NIKKI

What can we do, Cary?! What can we

do?!

CARY

Shep, why didn't you say you were

hurt?

SHEP

Good old Cary. Sweet Nikki. You may

not believe it but this is the best

thing that ever happened to me.

CARY

Oh, Shep, Shep, don't say that.

You'll be all right. We'll get you

to a hospital.

SHEP

No, no, Cary. Don't rush me anywheres.

Let's sit here for a while. The--

Hurts, the jolting.

CARY

Stop! Stop!

SHEP

That's better. You know, Cary, I feel

- just like we're falling -- long

time ago. Do you remember? Spinning

... spinning ... spinning. Only you

brought me down safe. Oh, Cary. Good

old Cary.

(sighs)

Best flyer in the service.

NIKKI

Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.

CARY

(reassuring)

We're gonna make a safe landing

again, Shep.

SHEP

Not this time, Cary. Ol' Shep's

gonna crash.

(beat)

Say, but we're spinning fast. Level

off. Cary, level off.

NIKKI'S VOICE

Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.

CARY

Shep? - Shep?! - Shep!

FADE OUT

DISSOLVE TO

NIKKI

What are you writing, Cary?

CARY

A letter. A letter to Shep's mother.

NIKKI

Mind if I read it?

CARY

Certainly not.

NIKKI

Why, Cary. Cary, that's the most

beautiful letter I've ever read.

NIKKI

Please forgive me for crying, Cary.

I can't help it. You don't mind if I

cry just a minute, do you?

CARY

No, Nikki.

NIKKI

Can't you cry, Cary?

CARY

No.

NIKKI

But you have cried sometime in your

life, haven't you?

CARY

Long, long time ago. Before the war.

NIKKI

And you can't cry now? Not even for

Shep?

CARY

Shep Lambert spent his life in the

war. He had nothing more to give. He

had died once. And he was ready to

die again.

NIKKI

This time he was played out with

music. That was the way he wanted it.

CARY

And Bill Talbot was a big success in

the hospital in his new blue shorts.

Maybe he'll tackle the angel Gabriel

and - be a big success again.

NIKKI

And Francis?

CARY

Maybe Francis will forget to wind

his chiming watch one day and go on

sleeping. Till the end. It doesn't

matter now. Without them, nothing

matters. We only had each other.

Comradeship was all we had left.

And now that's gone, too.

NIKKI

And you, Cary? You? You're alone

now.

CARY

That's right. I'm alone now.

NIKKI

I don't want you to be alone, Cary.

Let me stay with you. Let me be with

you.

CARY

Why, Nikki. You're sweet.

CARY

Why, Nikki, you kept it. You didn't

forget.

NIKKI

No harm can come to our true love.

CARY

(amused, skeptical)

No harm can come to our true love?

(genuinely)

Oh, Nikki, you've become very dear

to me. I want to help you. Can't I

do something for you, too? What do

you want? What can I get you?

NIKKI

Well, I've always wanted a pair of

Spanish earrings.
