ATTENDANT

You can't smoke in here.

CHARLES

A Mercury is a good car and that's

what I was driving that day. I've

owned a lot of cars. Different

kinds. Lots of different kinds of

cars. She was standing, this girl,

on the side of the street where

there was a chicken stand; not the

Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless

a chicken stand, and I pulled the

Mercury over and rolled down the

window by electric power. She was

wearing a leather skirt and she had

a lot of hair on her arms. I like

that. I like it a lot. It means a

big bush. I like a big bush. She

said, "Are you dating?" I said,

"yes," and she got in the car. We

pulled to a remote location, one

that she and I both felt

comfortable with and she said, "How

much can you spend?" I said, "What

it takes to see your bush. I know

it's a big one." She said "twenty

five dollars," which to a working

man is not chicken feed. I produced

the money and she put it in her

shoe and pulled up her skirt. There

before me lay a thin, crooked,

uncircumcised penis. You can

imagine how badly I wanted my

twenty-five dollars back.

THERESA

I don't know why you're so weirded

out, this is not San Quentin, it's

just a nuthouse. Most of these

people don't even know where they

are, they're not gonna hurt you.

MARSHA

In a few minutes we're gonna be in

a room with a killer. That doesn't

bother you?

THERESA

Hey, you're the one that wanted to

major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't

the guy something like twelve or

thirteen when he did it, it was

twenty-five years ago, he probably

doesn't even remember it.

MARSHA

(wrinkling her nose)

Do you smell shit?

THERESA

Yeah.

GUARD

These are the people from that

newspaper deal.

WOOLRIDGE

Oh yeah, from the college?

MARSHA

Yes sir.

WOOLRIDGE

My name's Jerry Woolridge.

MARSHA

Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha

Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans.

She's here to take the pictures.

WOOLRIDGE

Y'all have a seat. Is this all of

you?

MARSHA

Yes sir.

WOOLRIDGE

I think there must have been a

little mix up. I told your sponsor

or teacher or whatever he is, there

couldn't be any pictures. It's

s'posed to be just a little story

or article or something, isn't that

right?

MARSHA

Well, yeah, it's for the school

newspaper. But it has pictures. I

mean it's a regular paper, you

know.

WOOLRIDGE

Karl's real sensitive about having

his picture made. He wouldn't even

be on the bulletin board for the

Easter Collage.

(to guard)

Melvin, would you get me a good hot

cup with two sugar substitutes? You

girls want some coffee?

MARSHA

No thank you.

WOOLRIDGE

The other thing is I told your boss

on the phone to send a man. Karl

won't talk to women.

CHARLES

There was a young man named John

Liggit Hunter who was in the

filling station business and a good

filling station business. He was

one of those young men that we run

across so often in life. I'm sure

you've run across them, that didn't

deserve the things he had. One of

those things was his beautiful

bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia

Peach. As a matter of fact she

looked more like the picture I've

had in my head than any woman I've

ever seen. I took it upon myself to

take her away from John Liggit

Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm

not sure if I mentioned that he was

a Frenchman who claimed to be an

Englishman. It took some very

strong nylon cord to take her away

from him. She was a fighter as well

as a Georgia Peach.

WOOLRIDGE

I don't know what to tell you. I'm

sorry. I made myself pretty clear I

thought. He probably got busy and

wasn't thinking. I know how that

is. I used to teach shop and eighth

grade science.

MARSHA

Well, what do we do? We drove all

the way out here.

THERESA

Let's just go, Marsha.

MARSHA

No, we have to get this story.

THERESA

I thought you'd be happy to leave.

MARSHA

Why won't he talk to women?

WOOLRIDGE

He has problems. You know. With all

that. He won't hardly talk to

anybody really. Just certain

people. He's very troubled.

CHARLES

(leaning in to Karl)

A shovel just makes too goddamn

much racket.

WOOLRIDGE

(takes a drink of coffee)

I don't think he's talked to a

woman in twenty-five or so years.

That I know of anyway. That's why I

said to send a man. At least maybe

he'd answer a question or two for a

man. I'm all for helping the

college out, believe me. It might

be a real good article or story.

MARSHA

Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk

him into it. I'm a real good

interviewer. Just get me in the

room with him.

WOOLRIDGE

(to guard)

Melvin, go get Karl and take him

down to the old classroom.

WOOLRIDGE

I'll talk to him and see what we

can do.

WOOLRIDGE

You see, Karl, growing up, only

knew that sex was wrong and that

people who did it should be killed

for it. He couldn't really read

but, well, neither could his

mother. But, his father made sure

that his mother knew what the Bible

said. And she made sure Karl knew.

You know he slept in a hole in the

ground under a toolshed, right?

MARSHA

I knew he slept in a toolshed.

WOOLRIDGE

His mother told him that he was

their punishment. Hers and his

father's; from God, for having sex--

MARSHA

Before they were married?

WOOLRIDGE

I don't think so. Just period, I

think. She told him... God gave

them the ugliest creation he could

think of. Karl has an entire book --

a notebook. On every page it says

"Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number

1." He wrote that a few years ago

after he'd learned to write. His

father's name was Franklin.

MARSHA

That's really strange. What does it

mean?

WOOLRIDGE

One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I

imagine. Y'all pull up a chair.

I'll go out and talk to him.

CHARLES

You have to make something explode

to truly understand it. You have to

examine the tiny particles while

they're on fire.

MELVIN

Karl, I gotta take you down to the

old classroom. Mr. Woolridge has

some people for you to see down

there. Come on. Let's go.

WOOLRIDGE

Karl, you know, do you remember

when I told you about those people

from that newspaper?

(pause)

They want to ask you some questions

about your release. They think it

would make an interesting story.

Will you talk to 'em? Get

interviewed.

(pause)

Now, they're women. I think it

might be good for you to. You're

gonna be seein' all kinds of people

when you go on the outside. This'll

help you I believe.

WOOLRIDGE

Well, it surprised the dickens out

of me. He said he'll talk to you.

WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)

But, here's the thing. He'll only

talk to you. He doesn't want you to

ask him anything. And you shouldn't

stare at him.

MARSHA

How am I going to conduct an

interview if I can't ask him any

questions?

WOOLRIDGE

It's the best you're gonna get. I'm

sorry.

MARSHA

Can I ask you a question? If he's

so troubled, why are you letting

him out? What if he does it again?

It happens all the time.

WOOLRIDGE

He's free. His time's up. That's

the rules. He's been treated and

reevaluated. He doesn't show any

signs any more.

MARSHA

Signs?

WOOLRIDGE

Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna

change the light in here for Karl.

I hope you can see to write.

WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)

You'll have to step outside.

WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)

Please.

THERESA

Can I just sneak in there? I won't

take any pictures, I promise. I

just want to listen.

MELVIN

No ma'am. I'm sorry you can't.

MELVIN (CONT'D)

You can't smoke in here. I'm sorry.

KARL

Well, I reckon what you're a

wanting to know is what I'm doing

in here. I reckon the reason I'm in

here is 'cause I killed somebody.

But I reckon what you was a wanting

to know is how come me to kill

somebody. Well, I reckon I'll start

at the front and tell you.

(pause, heavy breathing)

I lived most of my life out behind

my mother and father's house in a

little old shed and my daddy'd

built for me. They didn't too much

want me up there in the house with

the rest of 'em. I mostly just set

around out there in the shed all

the time a lookin' at the ground.

It didn't have no floor but I had

me a hole dug out to lay down in

and a quilt or tow that I put down

there.

(pause, more breathing)

My daddy was a hard workin' man

most of his life, not that I can

say the same fer myself. I most

just set around the shed and

tinkered around with a lawn mower

or two and went to school off and

on from time to time but the

children there made quite a bit of

sport of me, made fun of me quite a

bit. Some of 'em roughed me up

sometimes so mostly I stayed out

back there in the shed. My daddy

worked down at the sawmill there,

down there at the planer mill for

an old man named Dixon.

Old man Dixon was a very cruel

feller, he didn't treat his

employees very well, didn't pay 'em

much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy

much of a wage, just barely enough

to get by on. But I reckon he got

by all right, they come out one or

the other of 'em, usually my

mother, and fed me pretty regular.

At least I know he made enough for

me to have mustard and biscuits

three or four times a week. Old man

Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon.

Jesse was really more cruel than

his daddy. He made quite a bit of

sport of me and takened advantage

of the little girls around the

neighborhood quite a bit.

(pause)

He used to say my mother was a very

pretty woman. He said it quite a

bit from time to time, when I was

at the school house. Well, I reckon

you want me to get on and tell you

what happened so I reckon I'll tell

you. I was settin' out in the shed

one evenin' not doin' too much,

just kindly starin' at the wall and

a waitin' fer my mother to come out

and give me my Bible lesson and I

heared a commotion up in the house

there so I got up and run up on the

screened-in porch there to see what

was a goin' on, and I looked in the

kitchen window and I seen my mother

a layin' there on the floor without

any clothes on.

(pause, breathing)

And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on

top of her having his way with her.

(pause)

Well, I just seen red. I picked up

a kaiser blade that was a layin'

there by the screen door, some

folks calls it a sling blade, I

call it a kaiser blade. It's just a

long handle like a axe handle with

a long blade on it that's shaped

kind of like a banana. Sharp on one

edge and dull on the other. It's

what the highway boys use to cut

down weeds and whatnot.

I went in the kitchen there and I

hit Jesse Dixon up side the head

with it and knocked him off my

mother. I reckon that didn't quite

satisfy me so I hit him again in

the neck with the sharp edge and

just plumb near cut his head off.

Killed him. Well, my mother, she

jumped up from there and started

yellin', "What did you kill Jesse

fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?"

(pause, intense breathing)

Well, come to find out my mother

didn't really mind what Jesse was a

doin' to her. I reckon that made me

madder than what Jesse had made me.

I takened the kaiser blade, some

folks calls it a sling blade, I

call it a kaiser blade and hit my

mother up side the head with it an'

killed her.

(long pause, breathing)

Some folks has asked me if I had it

to do over again would I do the

same thing. I don't know, I reckon

I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to

put me in here and here I've been

for a great long while. I've

learned to read some; took me four

years to read the Bible. I reckon I

understand a good deal of it. It

wasn't what I expected in a lot of

places. I've slept in a good bed

for a great long while. They've

seen fit to put me out now. They

tell me they're a settin' me free

today. Anyhow, I reckon that's all

you need to know. If you want any

more details I reckon I can tell

'em to you. I don't know if that's

enough for your newspaper or not.

MARSHA

Will you ever kill anybody again,

Karl?

KARL

(slowly)

I don't reckon I got no reason to

kill nobody.

MARSHA

Is he leaving right this minute?

WOOLRIDGE

We've got some paperwork to take

care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry,

you won't run into him in the

parking lot.

MARSHA

I didn't mean that.

WOOLRIDGE

I hope the best for you, Miss

Dwiggins, with your school and your

paper and all.

MARSHA

Where will he go?

WOOLRIDGE

Wherever he wants to. I think he's

going back to Millsburg where he's

from. It's just about twenty miles

from here.

MARSHA

Will he be supervised?

WOOLRIDGE

As much as anybody else is, I

guess. Y'all have a good rest of

the day now.

KARL

(looking down)

Thank you.

MARSHA

(immediately extends her

hand)

Thank you.

KARL

I reckon I'm gonna have to get used

to looking at pretty people.

WOOLRIDGE

Yes, I guess you are.

KARL

I reckon I'm gonna have to get used

to them lookin' at me, too.

WOOLRIDGE

You better go get your things.

KARL

I ain't got nothing but them books.

WOOLRIDGE

You better go get 'em.

KARL

All right then.

BOY

Can I help you?

KARL

I was kindly wantin' somethin' or

'nother d'eat.

BOY

Well, what did you want?

KARL

You have any biscuits for sale?

BOY

Naw, we don't have biscuits.

BOY (CONT'D)

Did you decide, sir?

KARL

What you got that's good to eat?

BOY

Well, I guess it's all good.

KARL

What do you like to eat here?

BOY

French fries. I like to eat them

pretty good.

KARL

French-fried potaters.

BOY

Yeah.

KARL

How much you want fer 'em? I'll get

some of them I reckon.

BOY

Sixty for small and seventy-five

for large.

KARL

Give me the big'uns.

BOY

These dang things are heavy. Hard

to carry, too.

KARL

What you got in there, warshing?

BOY

Yeah.

KARL

Ain't you got no mama and daddy to

tend to it?

BOY

I got a mama, but she's at work

over at Ben's Dollar Store. My

daddy's dead.

(pause)

He got hit by a train.

KARL

How fer you going with them sacks

full of warsh?

BOY

About a half a mile I think it is.

KARL

I'll help you tote 'em if I don't

give out first.

BOY

Okay. You don't have to though.

BOY

My name is Frank Wheatley. What's

your name?

KARL

Karl's my name.

FRANK (BOY)

What's you last name?

KARL

Childers.

FRANK

What are all them books?

KARL

Different ones. One's the Bible.

One of 'ems a book on Christmas.

One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.

FRANK

How come you're carryin' them

around with you.

KARL

Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.

FRANK

Don't you live somewhere?

KARL

I did live there in the state

hospital.

FRANK

Why'd you live there?

KARL

I killed some folks quite awhile

back. They said I wadn't right in

the head and they put me in there

in the nervous hospital instead of

puttin' me in jail.

FRANK

They let you out?

KARL

Yeah.

FRANK

How come?

KARL

They told me I was well. They had

to turn me loose.

FRANK

Are you well?

KARL

I reckon I feel all right.

FRANK

You don't seem like you'd kill

nobody.

FRANK (CONT'D)

This is my house. You can just set

those bags on the porch.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Do you like to play football?

KARL

I never was much count at it. I

never did get picked out fer it.

FRANK

Me and the Burnett twins and some

boys plays down at the junior high

practice field all the time. If you

ever want to come by and play. We

ain't no good either. Well, I'll

see you later.

KARL

How does a feller go about gettin'

up to the state hospital?

MAN

You buy a ticket for fourteen

dollars and then set and wait for

the four-fifteen bus to Kelton.

KARL

All right then.

WOOLRIDGE

Karl, what in the world are you

doing here?

KARL

I want to come back and stay here.

WOOLRIDGE

Well, you can't do that. You're a

free man. You've been let out to do

as you please.

KARL

I reckon I don't care nothin' about

bein' a free man. I don't know how

to go about it.

WOOLRIDGE

Well, you have to learn. It'll take

some time. Don't you know anybody

down there to help you out?

KARL

Naw.

WOOLRIDGE

Your daddy's still livin' down

there from what you told me.

(pause)

I guess he wouldn't help you any,

would he? I wasn't thinking. You

don't know anybody?

KARL

Naw. Never did know too much of

nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.

WOOLRIDGE

(sighs)

Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't

know where they expect you to go or

what they expect you to do. If it

was up to me, I'd let you stay here

if that's what you wanted. I'm just

doin' my job.

(they sit in silence for a

moment)

You follow me?

(no answer)

Listen, I know an old boy that runs

a fix-it shop deal down in

Millsburg. He used to go to church

with me. You're good workin' on

small engines and things. If I put

my neck out for you with him, will

you work at it if he'll hire you?

KARL

I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn

mowers and whatnot.

WOOLRIDGE

I know, I've seen it myself. Would

you give that a try?

KARL

I reckon.

WOOLRIDGE

I can't promise he'll hire you.

I'll have to tell him about your

history.

KARL

I never was no good with history.

WOOLRIDGE

No, I mean your past. About why you

were in here.

(pause)

I'll take you first thing in the

mornin'. You have anyplace you can

stay tonight at all?

I just can't let you stay here.

It's the rules. If something

happened well, I'd be liable.

KARL

I reckon I can just walk around

till the mornin'. Or set and read

me a book somewhere.

MRS. WOOLRIDGE

Karl, would you like a muffin?

KARL

No thank ye.

MRS. WOOLRIDGE

I understand Jerry is going to take

you somewhere else tomorrow.

KARL

I don't reckon I know nobody name

Jerry.

WOOLRIDGE

She's talkin' about me, Karl.

That's my first name.

KARL

He's a-carryin' me to look fer work

in Millsburg where I was borned.

MRS. WOOLRIDGE

Would you like some coffee?

KARL

Coffee makes me a might nervous

when I drink it.

DAUGHTER

Daddy, can I be excused to go to

bed?

WOOLRIDGE

Sure, honey. You sleep with Mama

tonight. I'll sleep with your

brother and Karl can take your

room.

DAUGHTER

Why?

WOOLRIDGE

We have company. Now you go on.

WOOLRIDGE

Well, Karl, there's plenty of

blankets and things there.

Bathroom's right there in the hall.

We'll leave first thing tomorrow.

MRS. WOOLRIDGE

Jerry, why didn't you give him

Bubba's room? Sister's is kind of

girly, isn't it?

WOOLRIDGE

Yeah, I thought about that. No

sense in moving him now I guess.

BUBBA

Daddy, don't you think one of us

ought to stay up all night and kind

of - guard or somethin'?

WOOLRIDGE

Why, hell no, son. What's wrong

with you?

BUBBA

Well, he's crazy. He's a nut ain't

he?

MRS. WOOLRIDGE

'Isn't' he, Bubba. Don't say ain't.

WOOLRIDGE

Karl, you up?

KARL (O.S.)

Yes sir.

WOOLRIDGE

Didn't you go to sleep at all,

Karl? You been sittin' there like

that all night?

KARL

Yes sir.

WOOLRIDGE

Well, I guess we better hit the

road.

BILL

Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to

see you. Been a long time.

WOOLRIDGE

Good to see you, Bill. How's

everybody doin'?

BILL

Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin'

me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put

me in the poorhouse. Can't complain

other than that. Wouldn't do any

good if I did.

(laughs)

Do you know Scooter, Jerry?

WOOLRIDGE

No, don't guess I do.

(he shakes hands with

Scooter who sort of

smiles)

Scooter, good to meet you.

(Woolridge leans in and

gets confidential)

This is him, the one I talked to

you about on the phone. Now like I

said, I'll understand if you get

nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie

to you now, he did get in that

trouble but then he was real young.

BILL

I remember it real well. Cut them

folks to pieces. His mama one of

'em.

SCOOTER

And that ol' Dixon boy. Hell, I

always wanted to kill him myself.

Asshole's what he was. I remember

that ol' boy

(points to Karl)

too. Kind of retarded or somethin'

back in school.

WOOLRIDGE

Well, he seems pretty well-adjusted

these days. I don't think he'd ever

hurt anybody.

BILL

Don't look much like he could. You

say he can fix a small engine like

nobody's bidness.

WOOLRIDGE

He's a regular whiz at it. That's

all he did when he was a kid.

BILL

Well, I ain't scared of him workin'

here. You know me. I'm a church

goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your

time's up the Lord's gonna come git

you. You seared of him, Scooter?

SCOOTER

I don't guess. Can he talk?

WOOLRIDGE

Oh yeah. Listen I really appreciate

it. He needs the job. I don't know

what to do with him. He don't have

anybody really.

BILL

That old man of his still livin'

over there on Clark Street I

believe.

WOOLRIDGE

He won't have anything to do with

him. Now you say it's all right for

him to stay out here in the back?

BILL

Fine with me. If he steals

anything, I'll take it out of your

pocket anyway.

WOOLRIDGE

He won't steal. I'm tellin' you

he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps

to himself.

BILL

Well, I've got a roomful of work

for him to do. Can't get Scooter to

do any of it.

WOOLRIDGE

Karl, come over here. I want you to

meet your new boss.

(Karl obediently shuffles

over)

This is Bill Cox, runs this place.

Says you can work here and stay in

the back.

BILL

Good to know you, Karl.

KARL

Thank ye.

BILL

Now it's minimal wage and there

ain't nothin' but a army cot and a

toilet back there.

WOOLRIDGE

That'll be fine. Karl, I'll go to

the car and get your books.

BILL

They say you're a whiz on fixin'

lawn mowers and things.

KARL

I've tinkered around on 'em a

little bit.

BILL

We order from Dairy Queen at

noontime usually. We can buy your

lunch till you get on your feet a

little.

KARL

I like them french-fried potaters.

BILL

(long pause)

Yeah, me too.

SCOOTER

They make a good double meat

burger.

BILL

All right then, I'll see y'all

later. Karl you done a good day's

work. They right about you.

Scooter, he's gonna knock you out

of a job if you're not careful.

I'll see you tomorrow.

SCOOTER

Wait up, I'll leave with you and

lock up.

BILL

Karl, they's a blanket up in under

that cot and soap in the bathroom

to clean up with.

(pause)

Now there's one more thing. The way

we lock these doors at night, you

can't get out. You didn't want to

go anywhere, did you?

KARL

I don't reckon.

BILL

If it works out and all, maybe

we'll get you a key so you can get

out at night if you need to. See

you later.

BILL

Scooter, did I tell about the two

old boys pissin' off the bridge?

SCOOTER

I can't remember.

BILL

There was these two old boys hung

their peckers off of a bridge to

piss, one old boy from California

and one old boy from Arkansas.

Old boy from California says, "Boy

this water's cold." Old boy from

Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep

too."

(starts wheezing)

Get it? That's a goodun.

SCOOTER

(laughing)

Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe

you did tell me that one before.

I've heard that a bunch. Long time

ago.

BILL

Well, yeah it's a classic. You

know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about

it last night and it's just not

Christian of me to not let you have

a key. I mean you been in lockup so

long, you don't need me keepin' you

locked up. You need to come and go

as you please. Here, take this key,

it'll get you in and out that back

door.

(Karl takes the key and

keeps eating french

fries)

Them french fries good?

KARL

Yeah, they's good all right.

BILL

You got any money?

KARL

They give me fifty dollars when

they turned me loose. I spent up

some of it on ridin' the bus and

eatin' french-fried potaters.

BILL

Well, I'm gonna pay you today for

this comin' week, so you'll have

some walkin' around money. When you

get off this evenin' you better go

buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up

supplies to have back there. Some

hard candy and some magazines.

Somethin' to keep you busy at

night.

KARL

All right then.

BILL

I'll let you off while it's still

daylight.

FRANK

Hey there. I thought I heard

somebody on the porch. Wasn't your

name Karl?

KARL

Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.

FRANK

Yeah. What you doin' by here?

KARL

You told me to come by.

FRANK

Did you want to play ball with us?

KARL

I ain't no good at it. I just come

by.

FRANK

Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to

go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar

Store. She's workin' two till

eight.

KARL

All right then.

FRANK

Wait a minute. You want to go with

me? You can meet my mama.

KARL

I don't want to worry your mama

with company.

FRANK

Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's

real nice. She'll give us somethin'

if we ask her to. Candy or

somethin'.

KARL

I was kindly needin' to do some

tradin'. Reckon they sell

toothpaste?

FRANK

They sell some of everything. Come

on let's go. I won't tell her about

you bein' in the state hospital for

killin'.

FRANK

Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.

LINDA

Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?

VAUGHAN

Let me guess. You want a bunch of

candy and a pop.

FRANK

Yeah.

VAUGHAN

You're gonna rot your teeth that

way. But I bet I know what you

would like even better.

I put potted meat on special, four

cans for a dollar and they're not

moving very well. I'd sure let a

few cans go for free to the right

boy.

FRANK

I don't like potted meat. Daddy

used to say it was made out of lips

and peckers and intestints.

LINDA

Frank, don't talk that way. Who's

that strange lookin' man behind

you? Did he follow you in here?

VAUGHAN

Can I help you, sir?

FRANK

Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the

laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama.

And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager.

He lets mama off any time she feels

like it 'cause they're best

friends.

LINDA

Nice to meet you, Karl.

KARL

(keeping his distance)

Pleased to know y'all.

LINDA

Frank come back here with me for a

minute.

VAUGHAN

I don't think I've ever seen you

before.

KARL

Naw, I don't believe you have. I

don't reckon I never been in here.

This store didn't used to be here.

VAUGHAN

It's been here seventeen years. Did

you live here before or something?

KARL

I's horned and raised here up till

I's twelve year old.

VAUGHAN

What brings you back?

KARL

What's that you say?

VAUGHAN

Why are you here now?

KARL

They turned me loose from the state

hospital.

VAUGHAN

Is that right?

(pause)

Are you going to be staying here

long?

KARL

I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired

on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.

VAUGHAN

Do you have family here?

KARL

Not really to speak of.

FRANK

Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you

can stay with us. Out in the

garage. Our car won't fit in there

anyway. It's real neat.

LINDA

Frank told me about your situation.

And Frank loves company. You know,

especially after his daddy passed

and all. There ain't no sense in

you stayin' in that old greasy

shop.

(to Vaughan, hushed)

He's mentally retarded, poor thing.

VAUGHAN

(hushed)

He just got out of the state

hospital.

LINDA

(put out)

I know.

FRANK

Can we get some candy and pops?

VAUGHAN

Sure, go ahead.

VAUGHAN (CONT'D)

Are you sure it's safe to let him

around that guy?

LINDA

Frank's just crazy about him. He

likes the way he talks. He helped

him carry home the clean laundry.

VAUGHAN

He's been in the state hospital a

long time, something must be wrong

with him.

LINDA

He's retarded's all. You know he's

always after a father figure and

Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one

with his mean ass.

VAUGHAN

What about me?

LINDA

I don't think he sees you as a guy

guy.

VAUGHAN

(wrinkles his brow)

Karl is a guy guy?

FRANK

This is what I call my secret place

'cause I come out here when I feel

like bein' by myself. I used to

come here with Karen Cross. She's

kind of like my girlfriend, or used

to be. She says she likes Jerry

Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her

back 'cause I love her. We used to

come here and hold hands and talk

and read books to each other with a

flashlight. She didn't want to have

anything to do with me in front of

other people 'cause I don't have

any money. Well, mama and me, I

mean. She seemed to like me a whole

lot when we were out here though.

She said she loved me, too. Out

here. Settin' right on that stump

you're on. See, her daddy's a

dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry

Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice

plant. Was your folks well off?

KARL

Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough

to scrape by on, I reckon.

FRANK

They still around, your folks?

KARL

My mother's dead. My daddy's

s'posed to be around still. He

don't want to have nothin' to do

with me though.

FRANK

How do you know?

KARL

He never did want to. I figure he

ain't changed his mind much.

FRANK

How did your mama die?

KARL

(long pause)

You don't need to know all of that.

You're just a boy.

You need to think about good

thoughts while you're still a boy.

They'll be plenty of time for the

other.

FRANK

I've had a lot of bad thoughts

since my daddy died. Sometimes I

wish I was still real little and he

was still here. My mama's real

good, but I wish I had both of 'em.

(pause)

When we went to Memphis one time in

the car, it was rainin' so hard we

couldn't see the road. But I wadn't

scared because I thought as long as

daddy was drivin' nothin' could

happen to us. I feel that way about

mama now.

(he looks at the ground

for a moment)

Mama has a boyfriend now. His name

is Doyle Hargraves. He works

construction so he makes a pretty

good livin'. He still don't help

mama out with any money though. He

ain't no good. He's mean to her. He

don't like me at all. Mama says

it's because he's jealous I belong

to my daddy instead of him. He

stays with us all night sometimes,

but he's got his own house.

Somebody told me it's so he can

still have other girlfriends. I

like it on the nights when he ain't

at our house. I'm not so nervous

then.

KARL

How come her to keep bein'

girlfriends and all with him if

he's mean to her?

FRANK

She says it's for the times when

he's good to her. She's lonely

since daddy died. She said

sometimes she don't know why.

(pause)

He threatened to kill her if she

ever left him. My daddy would kill

him if he was here and somebody was

mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real

good to mama. Vaughan that you met.

But he's not able to do anything to

Doyle, he's funny you know. Not

funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes

to go with men instead of women.

That makes him not to be able to

fight too good. He sure is nice

though. He's from St. Louis. People

who are queer can get along better

in a big town. He got transferred

here to work. But mama said the

real reason he left is 'cause his

daddy hated him. For bein' the way

he is. I wish he liked to go with

women. I'd rather him be mama's

boyfriend than Doyle.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Karl.

(pause)

You know when I said daddy got hit

by a train.

KARL

Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me

that.

FRANK

It ain't the truth. He shot hisself

with a shotgun on purpose.

KARL

Why did he do that, reckon.

FRANK

'Cause he didn't have enough money

to take care of us the way he

wanted to. That's what the letter

said. He got laid off from work and

had to just work odd jobs. I

thought he took care of us fine.

(pause)

Karl, did you really kill somebody?

KARL

Yeah, I did.

FRANK

Who did you kill?

KARL

Two people.

FRANK

Were they bad people?

KARL

I thought they was.

FRANK

Maybe they needed it.

KARL

I growed up and got taught it ain't

right to kill nobody.

FRANK

It's okay if you're lookin' out for

yourself. If it's self-defense. Was

it self-defense?

FRANK (CONT'D)

My daddy was good. I think too many

good people die. It ain't right.

That's what I think.

BILL

Now, Karl, you sure you want to go

stay with these folks? You're

welcome to keep on stayin here.

It's workin' out real good.

KARL

That boy wants me to.

BILL

All right then. I'll see you bright

and early. How you comin' along on

that garden tiller?

KARL

I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty

good.

BILL

You done fixed it? I'll be damned.

Scooter told me it couldn't be

fixed.

'Course Scooter's about as shitless

as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be.

You done fixed it. I'll just be

damned. See you tomorrow.

DOYLE

Well, honey, I don't guess I give a

shit. I ain't here half the time

anyway. If you want a retard livin'

in the garage, I don't guess I

care. I've got a good tool box and

socket set out there I don't want

stol'd. I guess I could take it

home with me.

FRANK

He's real honest. He wouldn't steal

nothin'.

DOYLE

Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you,

was I?

(pause)

Was I?

FRANK

No sir.

DOYLE

No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your

mama. This is your mama's decision,

not yours. I'm lettin' it go on

because she asked me, not you.

(to Linda)

Now is this the kind of retard that

drools and rubs shit in his hair

and all that, 'cause I have trouble

eatin' around that kind of thing.

Just like I am about antique

furniture and midgets. I can't so

much as drink a glass of water

around a midget or a piece of

antique furniture. Same thing with

a droolin' retard.

LINDA

Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't

be that way.

DOYLE

I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just

tellin' the truth. What was he in

the nuthouse for?

LINDA

He's just mentally retarded, I

guess.

DOYLE

He had of went nuts and did

somethin'. They don't put you in

there for just bein' a retard.

They's retards all over the place

that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you

know, Frank?

FRANK

I ain't sure.

DOYLE

You might want to find out. He

might of hacked his family to

pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.

LINDA

Yeah, that's right, Frank, you

better ask him. I mean, don't hurt

his feelin's or anything, but it

would be good to know. I'm sure

it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.

DOYLE

You sure are hung up on people

bein' sweet.

(takes a long pull on his

beer)

Speakin' of which, where's your

girlfriend? I thought he was comin'

by here for something.

LINDA

He'll be here in a little while,

he's takin' me to get an ice cream.

DOYLE

Ain't that the sweetest thing. What

am I supposed to do about supper

with you traipsin' around with that

fag?

LINDA

You're not crippled. Get in there

and make somethin'.

DOYLE

Boy, ain't you somethin' else.

Talkin' back and everything. It

kinda makes me horny when you talk

back.

LINDA

Frank, why don't you go off and

play in your room if Doyle's gonna

talk nasty.

FRANK

I want to watch T.V.

DOYLE

Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V.

Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a

family till your retarded friend

and your homosexual friend gets

here.

VAUGHAN

Karl?

KARL

Yes sir.

VAUGHAN

So, you're really going to stay

here?

KARL

That boy wants me to.

VAUGHAN

Did you knock on the door yet?

KARL

Naw, I ain't.

VAUGHAN

How long have you been standing

here?

KARL

Quite a spell, I reckon.

VAUGHAN

Listen, before you get very used to

staying here, I think you and I

need to talk about a few things.

Can I take you to lunch?

KARL

I done et just a little bit ago.

VAUGHAN

I mean tomorrow or the next day.

KARL

I reckon I can stand to eat a

little somethin' or 'nother at

noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox

generally gets me a box of french

fried potaters. But I reckon he can

lay off doin' it tomorrow.

VAUGHAN

Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and

get you at noon.

FRANK

Hey. Y'all come on in.

LINDA

Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?

KARL

Tolerable, I reckon.

LINDA

(in a hurry to get out)

Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle.

Frank, why don't you and Karl go

out in the garage and fix him up a

place or play a game or somethin'.

Vaughan, you ready to go?

VAUGHAN

Sure, I guess.

DOYLE

Don't rush ever'body, honey.

LINDA

(to Frank)

Maybe you and Karl want to go with

us?

FRANK

Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl

got things we need to do.

DOYLE

Hey, Vaughan, you know what I

heard? I heard you been puttin' it

to Albert Sellers that works over

at the funeral home.

VAUGHAN

I know Albert. We're friends.

DOYLE

I heard you was more than friends.

I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all

all bowed up and goin' at it in the

same room with poor, little, old

Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a

doornail layed out on a gurney.

VAUGHAN

That's ridiculous. That's just a

total lie.

LINDA

Let's go, Vaughan.

(they start for the door)

Frank, we'll be back in a little

while. I'll bring you back

somethin'. You're food's in the

oven warmin' over.

DOYLE

See, you made him somethin'. Hey

Vaughan, I was just goin' on with

you, jokin' around, buddy.

VAUGHAN

(smiles a little)

Yeah, I knew that. You're a card

all right.

DOYLE

So, Karl, come have a seat, talk to

me.

FRANK

Come on, Karl, let's go out to the

garage.

DOYLE

Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man.

You set right there, Karl.

DOYLE (CONT'D)

What's in your bag?

KARL

This and that. Toothpaste and

whatnot.

DOYLE

What's all them books?

KARL

Different ones. The Bible's one of

'em.

DOYLE

You believe in the Bible?

KARL

A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't

understand all of it.

DOYLE

Well, I can't understand none of

it. This one begat this one and

that one begat this one and begat

and begat and begat and lo somebody

sayeth some shit or another. Just

how retarded are you?

FRANK

Stop it, Doyle!

DOYLE

You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'.

The adults are talkin'. Were you in

the lockup for cuttin' somebody up

with a hatchet?

KARL

I ain't never used no hatchet that

I remember.

DOYLE

You're just crazy in a retarded

kind of way then.

(pause)

It wouldn't matter to me if you did

do violence on somebody 'cause I

ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm

afraid for you to stay here. You're

just a humped over retard it looks

like to me. Not really, I'm just

jokin' with you. Welcome to our

humble home, buddy. Frank needs all

the friends he can get. Frank's a

real weak little kid. His daddy

taught him how to be a pussy.

FRANK

Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about

daddy, you hear me!

DOYLE

(mocking)

Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on

to the garage and let me be.

FRANK

Come on, Karl.

DOYLE

(yelling to Frank)

Don't tell your mama we had a

little spat. She don't need to be

worried with your ass.

FRANK

I'd like to kill that son of a

bitch. I hate him.

KARL

You ort not to talk that way.

You're just a boy.

FRANK

Well, I hate him.

KARL

He ort not to talk that away to you

neither. He ain't no count. He's

mean to you and your mama.

(pause)

Yore mama and that feller that's

carryin' me to get somethin'

d'eat's gonna be back here

directly.

FRANK

Will you stay here with us for a

long time?

KARL

I reckon if you want me to.

(pause)

I got some of that potted meat and

sodie crackers left over if you

want some.

FRANK

I don't see how you can eat that

stuff with all those insides it's

made out of.

KARL

I reckon it tastes pretty good to

me.

FRANK

I like the way you talk.

KARL

I like the way you talk.

DISSOLVE TO:

VAUGHAN

Okay, Karl, the reason I brought

you here was to talk to you about

something that is on my mind.

(pauses for a response,

instead Karl eats french

fries and stares at the

table)

I guess I'll put it right out on

the table. Where do I start. Linda

and Frank are very important to me.

They're like family. My own family

was never like family. They're

horrible people. As a matter of

fact I prayed every night for years

that my father would die. I finally

realized through a lot of therapy

that I was wasting my energy on

hating him. Now I just don't care.

(pause)

You see, you and I are a lot alike,

strange as that may seem. I mean

not physically or even mentally

really, just well, maybe

emotionally or actually the hand

we've been dealt in life. We're

different. People see us as being

different anyway. You're -- well

you have your affliction or

whatever and I, well mine's not as

easy to see. I'm just going to say

it. I'm gay.

(watts)

Does that surprise you?

(watts)

That I'm gay. You know what being

gay is, don't you?

KARL

I reckon not.

VAUGHAN

Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.

KARL

Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.

VAUGHAN

Well that's a very offensive way to

put it. You shouldn't say that. You

were taught that, weren't you?

KARL

I've heard it said that way.

VAUGHAN

Anyway, it's hard to live gay,

that's the right way to say it, in

a small town like this. I've wanted

to leave many times, but my love

for Linda and Frank and another

certain person that we won't go

into have kept me from it. Anyway,

I'm rambling. If you're going to

live in the Wheatly garage you need

to know that it won't be easy.

Doyle is a monster. Not just a

closed minded redneck, but a

monster. A dangerous person. I've

told Linda that one day that man is

going to really hurt her or that

boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I

see it in his eyes. I'm very in

tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle

will make your life hell. You're a

perfect target. When I first saw

you I was afraid of you. Not really

afraid, I guess, just taken aback.

But also, I felt a real sensitive

feeling from you. And for some

reason, Frank has adopted you. Much

like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I

didn't mean it like that. In a good

way. Anyway, I just want you to

know what you're in for. I have a

good feeling about you. You're good

for Frank. Maybe it's that he can

have an adult friend on a child's

level.

I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a

bad way.

(pause)

There's one more thing. It's none

of my business why you were in the

state hospital. Everyone has

something in their past, maybe you

tried suicide, maybe you did

something -- terrible. But what I

see before me is a gentle, simple

man. All I want you to promise me

is that you're capable of being

around Linda and Frank. You know.

You would never hurt them under any

circumstances, would you?

KARL

I wouldn't never hurt them.

VAUGHAN

That's what I thought. I hope I

haven't offended you in any way.

You seem like a thinker. You seem

to always be in deep thought. Tell

me something. What are you thinking

right now?

KARL

I was thinkin' I could use me

another helpin' of these potaters.

VAUGHAN

Oh. How about before that?

KARL

Before that I was thinkin' it'd be

good if I could get another three

or four cans of that potted meat if

you got any extry.

LINDA

How come Karl won't eat here with

us?

FRANK

I don't know. He just said he'd eat

out there.

DOYLE

Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.

LINDA

I just feel sorry for the poor

thing.

DOYLE

Who could eat with him settin'

there makin' that goddamn racket

with his throat.

LINDA

He does make some funny noises.

FRANK

I sure like the way he talks. It

sounds like a race car motor

idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.

LINDA

I'm glad of it, honey.

DOYLE

What have you got to be nervous

about? You're a damn kid. You ain't

got any bills to pay or bidness to

run or old lady to stay on your ass

all the time.

FRANK

I get nervous, that's all I know.

DOYLE

You know what, by God?

LINDA

What?

DOYLE

You know what we ought to do

tonight?

LINDA

Please Doyle, don't.

DOYLE

Have a damn party! Call Morris and

them and get the band together and

just party our asses off. I'd like

to show that fuckin' Karl to the

guys. They'd get a kick out of

that. Don't you know they would.

LINDA

Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not

up for it. They always stay till

mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.

DOYLE

You don't have to do anything but

pour some potato chips in a bowl

and bring beers out when we get

low.

FRANK

Last time you got mad and run

Morris and them off and said to

stay away from here.

DOYLE

That ain't none of your damn

bidness. Besides that's the way

friends do one another. Fuck it,

I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find

my guitar, I think it's out there

in the garage with that loony tune.

LINDA

Karl, now listen, there's gonna be

a party tonight here at the house.

Doyle's invited his music-playin'

buddies over to make a bunch of

racket out on the patio.

FRANK

They ain't even no good. The only

one can play is Randy

Horsefeathers. He claims he's an

Indian. His real name's Randy

Collins and he works at the feed

mill. He can at least play guitar.

LINDA

He's no more an Indian than I am

though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try

and tease you and be mean to you to

show off to his friends. Just like

he does to Frank and me sometimes.

You just ignore it. Or stay out

here away from 'em if he'll let

you. He's an okay guy till he gets

drunk but tonight he'll get drunk.

I guarantee it.

FRANK

He ain't ever okay to me.

DOYLE

Well, it's on! We're gonna rock.

Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to

get over here. I'd like him to be

here. I owe him a good time.

LINDA

No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to

come to a party with you.

DOYLE

Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done

called him. He'll be here.

(grins)

Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I

need you to help me ice down a tub

of beer, you and Frank.

DOYLE

Okay ladies and gentlemen

(points to Vaughan)

or both. It's come to the time in

our show when we like to introduce

the band. Over here on lead guitar

Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on

hit a hot lick, Randy.

(Randy plays a lick)

Well, come on, y'all are supposed

to clap now. Come on!

(they clap a little except

for Karl)

LINDA

Karl, you better clap your hands or

he'll just keep on.

DOYLE

On the bass, give it up for Terence

"One Ball" Atkins.

(more half-assed clapping)

On the tambourine and lyrics Morris

Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the

group.

(claps)

On drums "The Johnson."

(claps)

And last and most importantly,

Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar

and business affairs and the only

motherfucker with a truck big

enough to haul this outfit on the

next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a

big hand for these guys. They're

workin' their asses off here.

(pauses for a slug of

beer)

Okay I'd like to dedicate this next

one to some very special people in

our audience tonight. To my lovely

female companion Linda, her lovely

son Frank, our new boarder Karl -

what's your last name Karl?

KARL

Childers.

DOYLE

Karl Childers just in from the

state facility. Make one of them

gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it

is you do.

(nothing)

Oh well, Karl's a little retarded,

he don't know what the hell I'm

talkin' about. And to Vaughan who

fucks a mortician in the rear

entrance right in front of his

clients. Now that takes balls. Our

number one tune for the folks,

boys. Kick it off Johnson!

DOYLE (CONT'D)

You like that Vaughan?

VAUGHAN

Sure. It sounded like a number one

tune all right.

DOYLE

You enjoying yourself, Karl?

KARL

I reckon.

VOICE (O.S.)

I wished you all would lay off for

tonight. I can't hear myself think

for that racket. It's nighttime,

now let folks be! I'll call the

law!

DOYLE

(hollers back)

I told you already three times, the

laws on my side. I play cards with

J.D. Shelnutt, chief' of police.

Get fucked you old bastard!

(to the party)

Okay now, Linda, you and the kid

clean up and get a tarpaulin over

this instruments. Me and the boys

are goin' to the county line.

We're out of liquor and beer. Come

on Karl, you and Vaughan are goin'

with us.

VAUGHAN

I'd better go on home now, it's

late. I have to work tomorrow.

DOYLE

Come on, don't be a pussy.

Everybody has to work.

LINDA

He don't want to Doyle. Don't go

Vaughan if you don't want to.

You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.

DOYLE

(very sincere)

But honey, I'll be good. I promise.

I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin'

to help these two be part of

things.

VAUGHAN

Are you sure you can drive? You've

really had a lot of alcohol.

DOYLE

Shhhh! This is the national anthem.

DOYLE

(points to tape player)

Not that you afflicted sons of

bitches would know anything about

it, but this is art.

DOYLE (CONT'D)

Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I

seen your pitcher in the paper for

catchin' that big-ass bass.

FREDDY

Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't

drunk drivin' are you Doyle?

DOYLE

Yeah.

FREDDY

I figured that. Well you better be

careful with that cripple in the

back. You'll throw him out. Looks

like you got a wagonful.

DOYLE

We run outta somethin' to drink.

Goin' to the county line. You want

to race?

FREDDY

(laughing)

You know better than that. We're on

duty. Catch me in that Camaro next

week one night.

DOYLE

Catch you later Freddy!

DOYLE (CONT'D)

I bet you like sittin' between two

men in a dual wheel truck don't

you?

VAUGHAN

Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.

DOYLE

Sarcastic right?

(pause)

You know the boys in the band are

probably gonna stay over tonight.

We'd be glad to have you.

MORRIS

Anyhow I'm not sure if you follow

me on those particular points, but

it's not really important in the

smaller picture, which is where

most people dwell anyway. Not that

being manager of Ben's Dollar Store

is insignificant. Or that making it

through years of incarceration in a

state supported facility is any

small feat.

THE JOHNSON

Morris, he's the only one in the

band that went to college.

RANDY

I'm in junior college right now

over in Westfield.

THE JOHNSON

That ain't no college, that's trade

school. Auto repair ain't ever made

a genius out of nobody.

MORRIS

Holidays are for campers.

RANDY

What do you know about bein' a

genius, Johnson. You can't even

hardly keep a steady beat on that

high-price drum set.

TERENCE

I think y'all play really tight

together, Randy. Y'all shouldn't

throw off on one another.

MORRIS

Anything that has to be discussed

can't mean anything.

DOYLE

You got that shit right.

VAUGHAN

What exactly do you mean by that? I

don't understand.

MORRIS

Exactly the point, my young

levelheaded friend.

VAUGHAN

I don't get it.

MORRIS

I rest my case.

TERENCE

Morris is real smart with

philosophies and things. That's why

him and me are the songwriting team

of our group. I make up good tunes

or melodies as we call them and

Morris is the lyrics.

MORRIS

Not unlike Gary Brooker of the

Protocol Harum.

RANDY

We don't ever play any songs that

y'all wrote. I never even heard one

of 'em. Y'all just talk.

THE JOHNSON

We don't even play any songs with

words at all that I remember. We

ain't got no fuckin' microphone. Or

speaker set up.

TERENCE

We wrote one last night standin'

outside Mini-Mart. Morris called it

"Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car."

Then, you know, like on country

songs in parenthesis it says "There

is usually someone in the trunk." I

came up with a tune just humming.

DOYLE

See Vaughan, you shouldn't question

a genius. Morris is a modern day

poet like in the old days.

MORRIS

Our latest composition is as

follows: entitled:

"The Thrill" --

"I stand on the hill

Not for a thrill

but for a breath

of a fresh kill

Never mind the man

who contemplates

doing away with license plates

He stands alone anyway

Baking the cookies of discontent

By the heat of a laundrymat vent

Leaving his soul"

(Then like in poetry I have dot dot

dot then drop down to the next line

kind of off center.)

"Leaving his soul parting waters

Under the medulla oblongata

of (then dot dot dot again)

mankind."

TERENCE

I don't think that's right. I

believe dot dot dot come between

medulla and oblongata or something

like that.

(Morris stares at him)

Well it did. It wadn't before

mankind, I know that much.

MORRIS

The dots are where I say they are.

Melody and tune. That's your trade.

You're a tunesmith Terence.

VAUGHAN

I don't really understand the

meaning of the words.

DOYLE

If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go

out of my mind. And plus you're

liable to bust a spring in Karl's

head. He's already off balance.

TERENCE

That wadn't the way you made it up

before, Morris. That's all I know.

RANDY

We don't need fancy words, we need

to practice. We don't ever

rehearse.

THE JOHNSON

We need some payin' gigs instead of

just messin' around on first one

patio and then another'n.

RANDY

Morris, you should just be the

manager, you can't play nothin'

anyway.

DOYLE

We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all

just shut the fuck up! We don't

need no practicin' or managers

cause we ain't no fuckin' band!

Morris ain't no genius and the rest

of you are just losers. Am I the

only one sane human bein' around

here? Just get the hell out of my

house and don't come back!

VAUGHAN

It's not your house, Doyle, it's

Linda's.

DOYLE

I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot!

You mind your own business. Now get

out! Now, before I get too mad to

turn back.

TERENCE

What about our instruments?

DOYLE

Now!

THE JOHNSON

(turning back)

You ain't right Doyle. Somethin's

wrong with you. Nobody needs your

shit.

MORRIS

(stops at the door)

The dots just look good on paper.

You don't sing 'em anyway. You're

showing your true Aries colors now.

DOYLE

Get out of my goddamn face, you

fuckin' buzzard!

DOYLE (CONT'D)

I thought I told everybody to get

out of my house. That includes

cocksuckers and retards. Get off

your asses and go.

LINDA

This is not your house, Doyle. This

is my house and I'll say who stays

and goes. You've got a house, why

don't you go get one of your

girlfriends and go home to it.

DOYLE

You know better than to talk like

that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make

me knock the piss out of you.

VAUGHAN

Doyle, don't you lay one hand on

her.

DOYLE

That's funny.

(to Linda)

You go to bed and take snot nose

with you.

LINDA

You're not stayin' here tonight. Go

get sober before you come back. I'm

tired of my child seein' this. Now

you get yourself straight or I'll

lock your ass out of my life for

good.

DOYLE

You know what I told you, you even

think of leavin' me, I'll kill you

dead as a doornail.

LINDA

That might be better than this.

VAUGHAN

I'm a witness. I heard you threaten

her life.

DOYLE

I thought I told you to keep out!

LINDA

Leave.

DOYLE

Don't tell me what to do.

LINDA

Leave.

DOYLE

Don't tell me what to do.

LINDA

Leave.

DOYLE

Don't tell me what to do.

LINDA

Leave.

DOYLE

(an inch from her face)

Don't tell me what to do.

DOYLE (CONT'D)

Okay, I'll leave and sober up.

Everything's botherin' me, that's

all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.

FRANK

I hate you!

DOYLE

Well, I hate you, too. No I don't.

I love your mama. Nobody

understands what I go through. I'll

leave. You bunch of freaks have

fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey.

I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass,

really.

(to Frank)

You ever hit me again you little

bastard and I'll make you sorry

your daddy ever squirted your

little ass out.

FRANK

You all right, Mama?

LINDA

I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and

forget about tonight.

FRANK

We don't need to think bad

thoughts, do we Mama?

LINDA

No, honey, we don't.

(pause)

I'll make some coffee and start

cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you

want some coffee, huh?

KARL

No, ma'am. Coffee kindly makes me

nervous when I drink it.

DISSOLVE TO:

LINDA

What are you doin' up again, Frank?

You need to get a little sleep.

FRANK

Did Vaughan go home?

LINDA

Yeah, he has to go to work in a

little while. I do too.

FRANK

Did Karl go to bed?

LINDA

I guess. He went to the garage.

Poor thing, he's probably never

seen such a crazy mess. He probably

wants to go back and live in Mr.

Cox's shop.

FRANK

I bet he don't. Karl likes me.

LINDA

I know he does.

FRANK

Mama?

LINDA

Huh?

FRANK

Is everything gonna be all right

someday? I just stay nervous all

the time just about.

LINDA

Yeah, honey, someday everything's

gonna be all right.

FRANK

Doyle wouldn't really kill you,

would he?

LINDA

I promise we're gonna get away from

him. The time has to be right,

that's all. I'd rather him get

tired of me and leave me. Then he

wouldn't want to hurt me. He

wouldn't care then. We'll be fine.

I promise. You go to bed now.

(she hugs him)

I love you.

FRANK

I love you, too, Mama.

LINDA

You scared me.

KARL

I didn't aim to.

LINDA

Want to sit down? Did you need

somethin'?

KARL

No ma'am.

KARL (CONT'D)

Two fellers was on a bridge a

takin' a leak and one feller says

the water was cold and the other

said it was deep water. One of 'em

came from Arkansas, I believe.

LINDA

(puzzled)

I'll be dog.

KARL

Do you reckon you can make me some

biscuits?

LINDA

Right now?

KARL

Just whenever you take a notion to.

I don't aim to put you out.

LINDA

Well, it is nearly breakfast time

anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have

to be at work in three hours. You

know how it is when you just sleep

an hour or two, you feel worse than

if you hadn't slept at all?

KARL

Yes ma'am.

LINDA

Well, set down and I'll make some

biscuits and gravy.

KARL

Mustard's good on 'em to me.

LINDA

Okay.

KARL

Thank ye.

LINDA

It's all right.

(pause)

You know I was thinkin' there's

this girl that works with me. She's

real heavy, but she's cute in the

face. Well, you know, she's slow.

She's a little bit, I think. She's

not retarded, just -- it don't

matter, listen to me. I thought you

might like to meet her. Vaughan

wants to have a little supper over

at his house and we could invite

her. Would you like that?

KARL

I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.

LINDA

Vaughan's "friend" will be there,

too. He works at the funeral home.

And Frank. You know Frank likes you

a lot. He says you make him feel

calm.

KARL

I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me

and him's made friends.

KARL (CONT'D)

Hit ain't right for me to keep from

tellin' you how come me to be put

in the state hospital.

LINDA

That's okay. It's not really my

business. I have wondered though.

Why was it? Was it like a nervous

breakdown?

KARL

I killed my mother and a old boy

name Jesse Dixon. I thought they

was a-doin' wrong. I was about your

boy's age. They say I'm well now

from it.

LINDA

Was that you? I remember that. I

was only three or four, but I

always heard about it growin' up.

(pause)

They say you're well?

KARL

Yes ma'am.

(pause)

I like your garage.

(pause)

I wouldn't never hurt you or your

boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible

and say the same thing.

LINDA

I believe you. I really do.

BILL

How 'bout you, Jerry.

WOOLRIDGE

How are you, Bill?

BILL

Doin' pretty good. Got a sick

tiller here. What's got you down

this way?

WOOLRIDGE

Just thought I'd check on Karl and

see if everything's working out.

BILL

Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for

them rackets and breathin' things

he does. Ain't threatened me with a

killin' or anything.

(laughs)

But boy you couldn't of been more

right about him fixin' things. That

son of a bitch is a regular Eli

Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves

french fries. Eats four larges and

don't even so much as belch. I'm

proud to have him.

WOOLRIDGE

Is him stayin' here workin' out?

BILL

He's gone to stayin' over with that

Wheatley boy and his mama in their

garage. I think that little boy

adopted him damn near like a

mascot. But he's got a key here to

come and go as he pleases.

Everything's worked out good.

WOOLRIDGE

Can I see him?

BILL

Sure.

BILL (CONT'D)

Scooter! Run get Karl for me.

WOOLRIDGE

Are you sure you're okay staying

with that woman and boy?

KARL

Yes sir.

WOOLRIDGE

Do they know about you?

KARL

My history.

WOOLRIDGE

Yeah.

KARL

I told 'em about it. They know I'm

well. That Mizz Wheatley made me

some biscuits.

WOOLRIDGE

I'll be.

KARL

That boy, he's my friend. He likes

the way I talk and I like the way

he talks.

WOOLRIDGE

I knew you'd do all right. Well, I

just wanted to check on you. I'll

say bye to Bill and get on back.

BILL

Karl, see if you can figure out

what's wrong with this thing. It

won't crank up and ever'thing seems

to be put together right.

WOOLRIDGE

I'll see you, Bill.

BILL

Okay, stop back by. Don't worry

about your boy here, he's doin'

good.

KARL

Hit ain't got no gas in it.

BILL

See there. Thinks of the simplest

thing first.

ALBERT

So Karl, do you intend to stay in

the lawnmower business for a while

or do you have other plans?

KARL

I reckon.

VAUGHAN

I think Karl is going to be a

writer or a librarian eventually.

You should see all the books he

has. He must read constantly.

KARL

I ain't read 'em yet except two or

three of 'em. I can't understand a

lot of what I try to read. My mind,

hit wonders off to somethin' else

when I try to read.

ALBERT

I'm the same way. Of course, in my

line of work, I stay too busy to

read.

But at least I have job security.

People may stop doing a lot of

things, but one thing is for sure,

they won't stop dying.

LINDA

(looks at Frank)

Why don't we talk about something a

little more festive.

VAUGHAN

Does everyone like the food?

VAUGHAN (CONT'D)

Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm

a good cook.

LINDA

Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda

was voted employee of the month at

the Dollar Store last February.

Isn't that somethin'?

KARL

Yes ma'am, I reckon.

MELINDA

Well, when you like pricing items

as much as I do, I guess it's just

bound to happen sooner or later.

VAUGHAN

Karl, maybe you and Melinda might

want to take a walk or something

after dinner. It's a nice night.

LINDA

Vaughan, don't get pushy.

VAUGHAN

I'm sorry.

KARL

I like walkin' quite a bit from

time to time.

MELINDA

I stay on my feet all the time at

work. I just can't find shoes

that's comfortable.

ALBERT

Hospital shoes might be the answer.

Nurses' shoes.

VAUGHAN

Or the kind old ladies who work in

the school cafeteria wear.

ALBERT

Same difference.

MELINDA

I get real mean when my feet hurt.

It's the only time I don't like

checkin' out the customers, when my

feet hurt.

LINDA

Frank, you and Karl aren't talkin'

much, you boys must really like

that food.

FRANK

I just don't have anything to say

about shoes.

VAUGHAN

Listen everybody, I know this may

sound corny, I've had a few glasses

of wine and that kind of makes me a

little emotional, but I'm going to

say it anyway. It just came over me

in a rush. I want you all to know

that I care about each and every

one of you at this table.

LINDA

That's very sweet of you Vaughan.

We care about you, too. Don't we

y'all?

VAUGHAN

Also, Melinda, please don't tell

anybody at the store that Albert

was here tonight, okay.

MELINDA

Why?

VAUGHAN

Well, a lot of people in town talk

and spread cruel rumors.

Unfortunately, I have to keep

certain parts of my life private.

MELINDA

You mean about y'all bein' together

in "that" way?

VAUGHAN

Yes.

MELINDA

I think everybody at the store

knows that already. They always

talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter

told a awful story about why you

ain't allowed over at the First

Baptist Church no more.

LINDA

Karl, why don't you and Melinda go

take a walk. It's nice out.

KARL

All right then.

MELINDA

You walk fast, don't you?

KARL

I reckon.

MELINDA

These is the worst shoes I own for

walkin'. How far did you want to

go?

KARL

I ain't really thought about it too

much I don't reckon.

BILL

Hey Karl, they's somebody out here

to see you. Some gal holding a nice

bouquet.

(Karl doesn't move)

Come on now, she wants to talk to

you. Don't just set there.

MELINDA

Hi, Karl, I'm on lunch break. These

was on sale 'cause they're not

fresh. Two ninety-nine a bunch plus

my ten percent employee discount.

Since I didn't bring you anything

to our date last night, I thought

you'd like to have 'em.

KARL

Thank ye.

BILL

Scooter, let's me and you go over

to Dairy Queen and pick up a few

things for lunchtime.

SCOOTER

I can go. You don't have to. You

don't never go.

BILL

Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon

my language, ma'am.

MELINDA

Well, I just thought I'd give you

them. I liked walkin' with you. I

got a blister the size of a quarter

on one heel. Well, I'll see you

sometime, I guess.

KARL

A blister shore can hurt.

MELINDA

Yeah.

KARL

Flowers is pretty. I've always

thought that.

MELINDA

Me, too.

FRANK

Hey Karl, you off work?

KARL

Yeah.

FRANK

Where'd you get them flowers?

KARL

That gal that made employee of the

month give 'em to me for awalkin'

with her.

FRANK

I was goin' to the secret place. I

borried one of your books to take

down there. You ain't mad, are you?

KARL

Naw. You can look at all my books

you want to.

FRANK

It's name's A Christmas Carol.

KARL

That's than un on Christmas I was

tellin' you about.

FRANK

You want to go with me?

KARL

Yeah.

FRANK

I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a

while.

KARL

All right then.

FRANK

Boy, folks sure had it rough back a

long time ago, didn't they?

KARL

Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like

to tore me up when I read about

that pore little cripple boy.

FRANK

Yeah, me too.

(pause)

That was nice of that woman to give

you them flowers.

KARL

Hit was right thoughty of her.

FRANK

I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.

KARL

All right then.

FRANK

You know that girl I told you

about. The one I love.

KARL

Yeah, I recollect it.

FRANK

Would you go see her with me? I

kind of thought I might take her

some flowers like that woman done

you.

KARL

If you want me to.

FRANK

I ain't got no money to get 'em

with but I bet Vaughan will let me

have some of them flowers at the

store.

KARL

I bet he will. I got a little money

if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.

FRANK

I usually get run off by her mama

or daddy if they're home. Reckon

why they don't like me?

KARL

They ort to. You're a good boy.

FRANK

Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean

I don't love her.

KARL

Naw.

FRANK

And I don't try to touch her. You

know, in a bad way. Foolin' around,

sex and all.

KARL

That's real good. You ort not to if

ye ain't married to somebody. Bible

tells you that much. Hit tells some

things that don't seem right too, I

reckon. I guess a feller ort to

foller it close as he can, though.

(pause)

You don't touch yourself, do you?

FRANK

What do you mean?

KARL

Pull on your works. Your privates.

FRANK

Oh, jackin' off?

KARL

Yes sir. You ort not know that

language.

FRANK

I didn't know till here while back

a year or two ago when I spent the

night with Ronnie Smart one time.

He said just tug on your peter and

think about your mama. I tried it,

but I felt funny thinkin' about my

mama. So, I switched over to

thinkin' about his mama and then

what he told me would happen,

happened. It sure tingles, don't

it?

KARL

You ort not to pull on yourself

that away.

FRANK

I kind of like you tellin' me what

to do and not to do. Just like my

daddy. I didn't mind him tellin'

me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to

do. Mama said the only way to ever

get away from him is for him to get

away from us. That we can't leave

him or he'll try and hurt her.

KARL

He ain't no count.

FRANK

You don't seem like a daddy. You

seem like a brother.

(pause)

Wonder what makes you like somebody

right off when you don't even know

'em like what happened with me and

you.

KARL

I don't reckon I know.

FRANK

And then some people you don't like

right off. It's funny.

(pause)

You know why I want you to play

ball with me?

KARL

Naw.

FRANK

'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if

you ain't no good. It takes your

mind off of everything else while

you're doin' it. When you run real

fast tryin' to make a touchdown you

don't think about anything else. I

ain't no good, but my daddy always

said he was proud of me when I

threw a ball or ran with it. Did

you have any brothers and sisters

growin' up to play with?

KARL

I had one there for little bit. Hit

didn't get old enough to play with.

FRANK

Why not? It died?

KARL

Yeah.

FRANK

Why?

KARL

Hit was borned a little too early

on. My mother and father made hit

come too early some way or other. I

reckon they changed their mind

about havin' another'n. I was about

six or eight year old then and they

didn't care too much for me so I

reckon they didn't need somethin'

else to worry 'em with.

FRANK

So it died when it come out?

KARL

My daddy come to the shed out back

and got me and said throw this here

away and handed me a towel with

somethin' in it. I went for the

trash barrel there and opened up

the towel to see 'cause they was a

noise and somethin' movin' in it.

Hit was bloody-like around that

towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty

baby, no bigger than a squirrel.

FRANK

It was alive?

KARL

Yes sir. Right then it was.

FRANK

A boy or girl?

KARL

A little ol' boy.

FRANK

You threw it in a trash barrel?

KARL

I didn't feel right about doin'

that. I takened a shoe box from

there in the shed and emptied out

some screwdrivers and nuts and

warshers from it and put the little

feller in that and buried him in

the corner of the yard there. That

seemed more proper to me, I reckon.

FRANK

It was still alive when you buried

it?

KARL

I heared it cryin' a little through

that box.

FRANK

That don't seem right. It seems

like you should have kept him alive

and took care of him if he was your

brother.

KARL

I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon

I didn't know what to do. I didn't

know how to care for no baby. Mama

and Daddy didn't want him. They

learned me to do what they told me

to. These days I figure it might of

been best to give him right back to

the Good Lord right off the bat

anyhow.

FRANK

That makes me feel real sad.

Couldn't you have done somethin',

Karl? I would have. I wish I would

of had him. He'd be here right now.

Livin'.

KARL

Hits been hard thinkin' about it.

They ain't a day goes by I don't

think about it. I kindly have a

picture of it up in my head that I

see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have

bad thoughts on it. I wished they

was somethin' I could of did, too.

Shouldn't no bad things happen to

childern. All the ol' bad things

ort to be saved up for folks that's

growed up, the way I see it. I

shouldn't of told you about that. A

boy ort not hear about such things.

It just kindly come out.

FRANK

I didn't mean to say anything bad

about you. I know you're good. You

didn't mean no harm.

(pause)

Did you ever think about killin'

yourself on purpose like my daddy

did?

KARL

I've studied about it. The Bible

says not to or you end up goin' to

Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I

call it Hades.

FRANK

Bible says the same thing about

killin' others, too.

KARL

Yes sir, I reckon it does.

FRANK

I always get nervous when I hear

that doorbell. I'm okay just

walkin' over, but somethin' about

that dang doorbell. They have one

room where you can't walk on the

carpet or sit on the furniture. I

don't see much sense in havin' it.

HOUSEKEEPER

(eyes Karl)

Son, I don't know why you keep

comin' over here. You know these

folks don't want you here. They run

you off ever' time. Don't keep

doin' this to yourself. You a sweet

boy. Now go give them flowers to

somebody that'll enjoy 'em.

FRANK

Ma'am, I really want to give them

to Karen.

HOUSEKEEPER

(to Karl)

You his daddy?

KARL

No ma'am.

HOUSEKEEPER

Well, whoever you are, you ought to

talk some sense into him. That

little old girl is way too fast for

him and don't wanna see him no way.

FRANK

Will you get her for me. Please. I

really want to see her.

She'll want to see me, too, 'cause

we're not in public. Just don't

tell her folks I'm here.

HOUSEKEEPER

(sighs)

Okay.

KAREN

(put out)

Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming

over here. My parents really don't

want you to.

FRANK

I wanted to bring you some flowers.

They're pretty good ones.

KAREN

They're from the Dollar Store. I'm

not an idiot. Besides we have a

garden full of flowers.

FRANK

I wanted for you to meet Karl, too.

He's my new friend. But I feel like

I've always known him. I thought

you should meet him.

KAREN

Why? Hi, Karl.

FRANK

He's gonna be around a lot and I

hope you are too, so...

KAREN

Here give me the flowers, I'll do

something with them. Thank you. Now

you better go. Maybe I'll see you

down at the secret place one day in

a week or two or something. I have

a boyfriend now you know. And we're

pretty serious. He gave me a ring.

FRANK

Can you go there with us now? Me

and Karl. We could just hang out.

Karl has some cool books.

KAREN

Frank, I just like you as a friend.

Only at the secret place. Okay? I

can't go there now. I'll see you

later.

FRANK

But maybe just for awhile --

KAREN

I'm closing the door now. I told

you, I'll see you later.

FRANK

She said she'd see me later. That's

kinda good, right?

KARL

I reckon.

DOYLE

Well, I'll be damned, there's the

boys. I'm glad y'all came in. I

wanted to talk to y'all, too. I was

just tellin' Linda here -- Oh hell,

I'll just start over, set down you

boys.

DOYLE (CONT'D)

Well, what it is is, I just, well I

took off work early today and your

mama was good enough to do the same

so we could talk. I guess you'd say

I'm really here to apologize, which

ain't easy for me to do, about the

way I acted the other night. I was

just drunk and kinda got a little

too worked up and one thing led to

another. I care about y'all a lot,

I do. I don't mean to be so damned,

assholish I guess the word would

be. Now Karl, I don't believe I hit

you, did I? So no apology needed

there I guess, but Frank, I'm

sorry. I'm sorry I hit your mama.

I'm just jealous of her. I don't

like her life or the way she runs

it. I don't like homosexuals and

she buddies with one. I don't like

little wimpy ass kids or fuckin'

mental retards and she's got one of

each livin' with her.

(laughs)

I was just kiddin'. But really I

guess people need to get along even

if they have differences.

(pause)

You see, I work construction. I

build things. Do you realize how

important that is to the world. I

have a lot of pressure on me. The

upshot is, I'm gonna spend a lot

more time over here and we're gonna

get along. Like a family should.

(to Linda)

I may even surprise you one day and

pop the question.

(he gets up)

Well, I'm goin' back to work. I

just wanted to give y'all some

little piece of happiness today.

(kisses Linda)

See you tonight honey. Karl. Be a

good boy, Frank.

LINDA

Well, at least he's tryin'. But who

knows for how long.

FRANK

He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do

better.

LINDA

I know honey. Just remember what I

said, we'll bide our time. You just

steer clear of him as much as you

can. Doyle's had a real hard life.

It's just about run him crazy I

think.

FRANK

We've had a real hard life, too,

Mama.

LINDA

You're a hell of a boy, Frank.

Someday you're gonna get all the

good things you deserve. And Karl

here's gonna get some more biscuits

tonight. What do you think about

that?

KARL

I could shore use some. Thank ye.

BILL

Hey there Karl, can you come unload

a generator for me?

BILL

Karl, lift this thing down and

carry it to the back. It's on the

blink.

(to man as Karl unloads

it)

We'll have it for you in a day or

two, Walter.

WALTER

Y'ont us to he'p you there liftin'

that?

BILL

Oh no, that dang Karl can lift a

bulldozier. Fix anything, too.

(confidentially)

He's mentally retarded, but he's a

whiz on small engines. Lord works

in mysterious ways.

WALTER

Hell, he didn't just make the team,

Coach says he's probably gonna

start at end on defense. He's a

chip off the old block. Ain't you,

Steve?

STEVE

I guess so.

FRANK

What you readin'?

KARL

Readin' on this book on how to work

carpentry. I aim to learn how to

build things out of wood one of

these times. I've always been

partial to wood buildin's and

cabinets and whatnot. These

drawin's they got here don't make

no sense to me so far.

(he looks directly at

Frank, which he seldom

does)

You seem like yore tails a'draggin'

a might. You got somethin' wrong

with ye?

FRANK

Seems like Doyle's wormed his way

back in. Mama said he's stayin'

over tonight and he's talkin' about

movin' in for good. We ain't ever

gonna be happy. We'll always be

nervous, won't we Karl?

KARL

I don't reckon I know. I ain't

found no way yet and I'm three or

four times as old as you. Might be

that's just the way folks is.

FRANK

I feel sad about Karen Cross, too.

I just make like to myself she

loves me. I know better, though. It

just feels good to me when I

imagine it.

KARL

Make believin' always made me feel

good too from time to time.

KARL (CONT'D)

Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for

a Mister Turner tomorrow and a

closin' up shop early.

FRANK

Is that right?

KARL

I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if

neither one of us is no count it

won't make no difference.

FRANK

You will? For sure?

KARL

Yeah.

FRANK

We'll be on teams, me and you?

KARL

Yessir.

FRANK

Way to go, Karl. We got a

touchdown. That was a good lateral,

man. That was just like the

Wishbone.

KARL

I dern near had me a touchdown till

them boys got a-hold of me there so

I figured I better give it off to

you. I seen you over there

follerin' me.

FRANK

We're liable to win if we keep this

up. For somebody like you, you sure

run fast.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Come on, let's kick off to 'em.

FRANK

I know you could of scored them

three touchdowns by yourself

instead of throwing 'em over to me.

KARL

Them boys was tryin' to pull me

down pretty hard.

FRANK

You're strong though. You let me

make them touchdowns so I'd feel

good. My daddy used to do that kind

of thing.

FRANK (CONT'D)

It don't matter to me about us

losin' does it to you?

KARL

No sir.

FRANK

It was fun, anyhow.

KARL

I wadn't thinkin' about nothin'

else just like you told me I'd do.

FRANK

Can we play ever' Saturday?

KARL

If I ain't too stove up. I ain't

like you. I'm old and give out.

(pause)

I'm proud of ye.

KARL

I'm ye boy.

OLD MAN

I ain't got no boy.

KARL

I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.

OLD MAN

I ain't got no boy.

KARL

They turned me aloose from the

nervous hospital. Said I was well.

KARL (CONT'D)

I got hired to work for a Mr. Cox

fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot.

KARL (CONT'D)

That grass out in the yard's all

growed up. I figured I might cut it

fer ye.

OLD MAN

I told you, I ain't got no boy, now

get on out from here and let me be.

KARL

I learned to read some. I've read

on the Bible quite a bit. I don't

understand all of it, but I believe

I understand a good deal of it.

Them stories Mama and you told me

ain't in there. You ort not to of

done that to ye boy.

(pause)

I've studied on killin' you. But I

don't reckon they's no reason fer

it if all you're gonna do is set

there in that chair. You'll be dead

soon enough I reckon and the

world'll be shut of ye.

(Karl walks toward the

kitchen and turns back to

the old man)

You ort not to of killed my

brother. He ort to have had a

chance to grow up. Sometimes he

would of had fun.

KARL

Little feller.

DOYLE

What in the goddamn hell are you

doin'? It's the middle of the

night.

LINDA

What do you want, hun?

KARL

I want to be baptized.

DOYLE

Baptized? Well, get baptized then.

I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin'

preacher, goddamnit! I can't

baptize you.

LINDA

We'll go to church and get you

baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go

on back to bed.

DOYLE

What are you doin' with that damn

hammer?

KARL

I don't rightly know. I just kindly

woke up a-holdin' it.

DOYLE

How'd your baptizin' go?

LINDA

It went real good.

DOYLE

Well, that's good. It's about time

to eat and you know what I'm

cravin'? Some of that take out

chicken. Why don't you run get some

of it, honey, for lunch?

LINDA

(to Frank and Karl)

Would y'all like that?

FRANK

Yeah, I guess.

KARL

Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken

leg.

LINDA

All right, y'all gonna go with me?

DOYLE

Naw, hell, let them stay here with

me and do men things. There might

be some kind of ball game on we can

watch. You go on.

LINDA

I'll be back in a little bit then.

DOYLE

I really just wanted to git your

mama out of the house for a minute

so we can have a talk. Y'all set

down.

DOYLE

Now here's the deal. Now that I'm

gonna throw my entire life away

doin' what I want to come live here

with y'all, we have to get a few

things straight. See, Frank, me and

you mama wouldn't have any problems

if it wadn't for you. We'd never

have a bad word between us. But

since you do exist, if I'm gonna be

here as the head of the household,

we'll have to live by my rules.

And my rules are you don't speak

unless you're spoken to. Stay out

of my way and do what a regular kid

does. You're a weird little shit. I

don't get you. So wake up. Face

what they call reality. We're gonna

be a family now. And it's my

family. I'll be payin' the bills so

you got me. But I ain't your daddy.

You just treat me like I am. I'm

the boss, okay. And the other thing

is your friend Karl has to go. We

can't have a normal family with him

livin' in the garage and comin' in

the bedroom at four in the mornin'

with hammers and shit. See?

FRANK

Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama

said --

KARL

Don't hit that boy no more.

DOYLE

You shut up you, fuckin' retard.

Get your shit and get out of here.

(to Frank)

That was a wake-up slap, Frank.

Remember. Reality, like I said.

Don't forget any bit of what I said

to you and we'll be fine.

LINDA

Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't

you want some chicken and things?

KARL

No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.

LINDA

Well, okay. I got you some.

KARL

Frank, he went off, too. He ain't

gonna be in there when you get

indoors.

LINDA

Where'd he go? What's goin' on?

KARL

He wanted to go off and play, I

reckon.

(pause)

You go in there and you and that

Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have

to worry yourself none.

LINDA

All right then. Well, I'll see you

later. If you see Frank, tell him

to come on back home. I don't get

to see him all day except Sundays.

He can play tomorrow.

KARL

Ma'am?

LINDA

Yeah.

KARL

You're a good mama to that boy. You

care for him. You work hard fer him

to take care of him. You light him

up in his eyes, I've seen it. He

wouldn't know what to do without

ye.

LINDA

Well thank you, hun. That's real

good of you to say. I wouldn't know

what to do without him either.

KARL

You've been real good to me, too.

It ain't ever'body that'd make

biscuits in the middle of the

night. You and that boy has give me

a good feelin'.

LINDA

We sure like havin' you.

KARL

Thank ye.

(Karl walks away, then

turns)

I'm just getting around to tellin'

you, but I fixed your warshin'

machine.

FRANK

Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come

out here?

KARL

I knowed you'd be here.

(Karl sits on the stump)

What are you a-doin' digging with

that stob?

FRANK

Just diggin'.

(pause)

I ain't ever gonna be happy now.

Not with that son of a bitch movin'

in for good. I wish me and you and

Mama could just run away. But she

said he would find us wherever we

went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think

it would of been better if I wadn't

ever born.

KARL

I'm glad of it you was borned.

(pause)

I reckon I ain't gonna be there in

the garage no more.

FRANK

You have to Karl. You have to look

out for me. You don't let that son

of a bitch run you off.

KARL

You're just a boy. You ort not to

use that sort of language.

FRANK

Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin'

bad about you, but why don't you

stop Doyle when he gets that away?

You're older than him. You're

strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let

him do that to me and Mama.

KARL

That feller's a whole sight meaner

than me. He'd just whup the tar out

of me.

FRANK

Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired,

you know that. A kid my age

shouldn't be tired of things.

KARL

I'm tired, too, Frank.

(pause)

If I ain't around no more, it don't

mean I don't care fer ye. I care

for ye a good deal. I care for you

more than anybody they is. We made

friends right off the bat.

FRANK

I care for you, too. But you'll be

around, don't say that.

KARL

Hit don't make no difference where

I was to be. We'll always be

friends. There ain't no way to stop

that.

(pause)

I aim for you to have these books.

KARL

Maybe you can make more sense out

of them than I can.

I made you a little old book marker

and stuck it in that book on

Christmas.

FRANK

You don't want to give away all

your books.

KARL

I aim fer you to have 'em.

FRANK

Man. Thanks.

(pause)

You know when you get a feelin' and

you don't know why?

KARL

Yes sir.

FRANK

I've got a feelin' today.

KARL

Reckon what kind of a feelin'?

FRANK

Like something different. I don't

know.

(pause)

You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?

KARL

Will ye do somethin' for me if I

ast you to?

FRANK

You know I would. Whatever you

want.

KARL

Don't go home tonight and stay with

that Doyle. He's got it in for ye

tonight. I got me a feelin', too.

Feels like to me you ort not be

there in that house with him

liquored up and mean. Ye mama

neither. When you get up from here,

I want you to go to that feller's

house. Your mama's friend. I want

you to give me your word on it.

FRANK

Okay. I give you my word. Is

ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you

all right?

KARL

Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly

want to put my arm around ye for a

minute and then I'm gonna go on and

leave here.

FRANK

Okay.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Karl!

VAUGHAN

Karl, what are you doing here? Come

in.

KARL

I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast

you fer a favor.

VAUGHAN

Okay.

KARL

This evenin' I want you to go get

Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and

have them stay with you tonight.

VAUGHAN

What's wrong? Is everything okay?

KARL

That dern Doyle is in a bad way

again with that drinkin' and bein'

mean to folks. Will you give me

your word you'll do it?

VAUGHAN

Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt

them, has he?

KARL

Naw, not yet.

(hands the bag to Vaughan)

I want ye to give this to Mizz

Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe

there's a little somethin' to hep

out. Hits what I've earned fixin'

lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill

Cox.

VAUGHAN

What about you, Karl? Do you want

to stay here?

KARL

I don't reckon you have to go with

women to be a daddy to a boy.

(pause)

You've been real square dealin'

with me. The Bible says two men ort

not lay together. But I'll bet you

the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody

like you to Hades. Some folks calls

it Hell, I call it Hades.

(Karl starts away)

That boy lives inside of his own

heart. Hits an awful big place. You

take care of that boy.

DOYLE

Where's ever'body else? You seen

'em?

(no response)

I thought I told you to get the

hell moved out of here anyway.

KARL

How does a feller go about gettin'

ahold of the police?

DOYLE (CONT'D)

Pick up the fuckin' phone and call

'em, I guess.

KARL

What numbers do you punch?

DOYLE

I told you to get away from here,

didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and

look at TV.

(notices blade)

What are you doin' with that piece

of iron? I swear to God you're the

weirdest son of a bitch I ever

heard of.

KARL

I aim to kill you with it.

DOYLE

Yeah, okay. Well, to get the police

you push 911. You'll need to tell

'em to send an ambulance, too. Or a

hearse. You fuckin' idiot. You're

gonna kill me.

(laughs)

DOYLE (O.S.)

Oh God! Oh God!

KARL

(into phone)

Yes ma'am. I need the police over

here at the Wheatley house.

(pause)

I've killed somebody with a mower

blade.

(pause)

Yes ma'am, I'm right sure of it. I

hit him two good whacks. That

second time just plumb near cut his

head in two.

(pause)

Hits a little old yeller house

right on the corner of Marigold

Street and some other street.

They's a red pickup truck out front

says DOYLE HARGRAVES CONSTRUCTION

on it. I'll be a settin' here

waitin' on ye. Beside sendin' the

police, Doyle said you might want

to send a ambulance or a hearse.

Thank ye.

CUT TO:

CHARLES

... on the third day I washed her.

She wasn't very clean. I got all

the right spots. She was the first

one I ever kept for any length of

time, you see I get bored easily, I

have a short attention span. I

can't say she enjoyed her stay,

although the washcloth in her mouth

held in place by good duct tape

kept any complaints to a minimum. I

don't really like people who talk a

lot. I like to do the talking. I

guess that's why I'm so fond of

you. You're so easygoing, although

I do sense a little tension in you

sometimes. By the way, how was it

out there? Did you have any fun?

Make any new acquaintances? Tell me

what it was like.

KARL

They was a boy. We made friends.

CHARLES

I bet you did. I was never bent

that way. I'm bent the other way.

So, you liked it out there in the

world.

KARL

It's too big.

CHARLES

Well, it's not too big in here, is

it?

(pause)

I feel very generous today. I feel

like listening. I'm sure you have

plenty to tell me. And please bore

me with the details.

(long pause) )

Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was

it the boy?

KARL

Don't say nothin' about that boy.

KARL

Fact the bidness, don't you say

another word to me. I ain't

listenin' to you no more.

FADE OUT.

THE END
