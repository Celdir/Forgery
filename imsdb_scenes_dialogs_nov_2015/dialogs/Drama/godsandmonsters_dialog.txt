SHOOTING DRAFT

DAVID

I'd have more peace of mind if the

live-in nurse were still here.

HANNA

She was nothing but bother.  I not

like her, Mr. Jimmy not like her.

We do better if you live-in again,

Mr. David.

DAVID

You'll contact me if there's an

emergency?

HANNA

Yes, I call you at this number.

(calls out)

Mr. Jimmy?  More coffee?

WHALE

What?  Oh yes.  Why not?

WHALE

Isn't Hanna a peach?

DAVID

She tells me you haven't been

sleeping well.

WHALE

It's the ridiculous pills they

prescribe.  If I take them, I spend

the next day stupid as a stone.

If I don't, my mind seems to go off

in a hundred directions at once --

DAVID

Then take the pills.

WHALE

I wanted to be alert for your visit

today.  Especially since I saw so

little of you in the hospital.

DAVID

I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this

movie and two difficult stars --

WHALE

"The fault, dear David, is not in

ourselves but in our stars."

DAVID

(too anxious to laugh)

You remember how a production eats

up one's life.

WHALE

Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in

making you feel guilty.

(stands)

You better go, my boy.  You'll be

late for that aeroplane.

DAVID

By the way, I like the Renoir.

WHALE

Thank you.

DAVID

(calls out)

Goodbye, Hanna.

SARAH WHALE (O.S.)

Stop lagging behind, Jimmy.  We'll

be late for church.

YOUNG WHALE

Yes, Mum.

WILLIAM WHALE

Straighten up, son.

WHALE

Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?

HANNA

Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I

hire him while you were in the

hospital.  He came cheap.

WHALE

The bells of hell go ting-a-ling

For you but not for me.

Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling?

Grave where thy victory?

WHALE

Good morning.

CLAY

(not looking up)

Mornin'.

WHALE

My name is Whale.  This is my

house.

CLAY

Nice place.

WHALE

And your name is --?

CLAY

Boone.  Clayton Boone.

WHALE

I couldn't help but notice your

tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before

Dishonor.  What does it mean?

CLAY

Just that I was in the Marines.

WHALE

The Marines.  Good for you.  You

must have served in Korea.

WHALE

Getting to be a warm day.  A

scorcher, as you Yanks call it.

CLAY

Yeah.  I better get on with my

work.

WHALE

When you're through, Mr. Boone,

feel free to make use of the pool.

We're quite informal here.  You

don't have to worry about a suit.

CLAY

No thanks.  I got another job to

get to this afternoon.

WHALE

Some other time, perhaps?  Keep up

the fine work.

SARAH WHALE

Jimmy.  The privy needs cleaning.

WHALE

I have my class tonight.

SARAH WHALE

Don't get above yarself, Jimmy.

Leave the drawring to the artists.

WHALE

Quite so, mum.  To the privy.

SARAH WHALE

"Quite so."

(calls out)

Jimmy Whale.  Who are ya to put on

airs?

WHALE

There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber

sandwiches?

HANNA

Yes, Mr. Jimmy.

(smiles)

An interview.  After so many years.

Very exciting.

WHALE

Don't be daft.  It's just a student

from the university.

HANNA

Mr. Kay, sir.

WHALE

(feigning surprise)

Yes?

WHALE

Ah, Mr. Kay.  I'd almost forgotten.

My guest for tea.

KAY

Mr. Whale, this is such an honor.

You're one of my favorite all-time

directors.  I can't believe I'm

meeting you.

WHALE

(gently, teasing)

No.  I expect you can't.

KAY

And this is your house.  Wow.  The

house of Frankenstein.

(looks around)

I thought you'd live in a spooky

old mansion or villa.

WHALE

One likes to live simply.

KAY

I know.  People's movies aren't

their lives.

KAY

Love dead.  Hate living.

KAY

That's my favorite line in my

favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of

Frankenstein."

WHALE

Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll

take our tea down by the swimming

pool.

WHALE

Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?

KAY

Sure.

WHALE

(opens the back door)

After you then.

KAY

I love the great horror films.  And

yours are the best.  "The Old Dark

House."  "The Invisible Man."  They

look great and have style.  And

funny!

WHALE

This is the studio where I paint.

KAY

Nice.

(refusing to be

sidetracked)

And your lighting and camera

angles.  You're got to go back to

German silent movies to find

anything like it.

HANNA

Time for you to leave.

CLAY

I'm on my way.

WHALE

So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to

know?

KAY

Everything.  Start at the

beginning.

WHALE

I was born outside London, the only

son of a minister who was a master

at Harrow.  Grandfather was a

bishop.  Church of...Church of

Eng...

KAY

Mr. Whale?

WHALE

Yes?

KAY

Your father was a schoolmaster?

WHALE

Of course.  I attended Eton -- it

wouldn't do for a master's son to

attend where his father taught.  I

was to go up to Oxford but the war

broke out and I never made it.  The

Great War, you know.  You had a

Good War, but we had a great one.

WHALE

You can't imagine what life was

like after the Armistice.  The

twenties in London were one long

bank holiday, a break from

everything dour and respectable.  I

had a knack with pencil and paper,

so I was hired to design sets for

stage productions.

WHALE

Thank you, Hanna.  Very nice.

WHALE

You can go now.

WHALE

There was one play in particular, a

beautiful, grim study of war called

"Journey's End".  Every experienced

director turned it down, so I

offered myself, bullying and

begging for the job.  "Journey's

End" made the careers of everyone

associated with it.  It was only a

matter of time until Hollywood

beckoned.

KAY

How much longer before we get to

"Frankenstein"?

WHALE

Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay,

that it's not me you're interested

in, only my horror pictures?

KAY

Oh no, I want to hear everything.

You made twenty pictures in all --

WHALE

Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies

and dramas were much more to my

liking.  The horror pictures were

trifles.  Grand guignol for the

masses.

KAY

But it's the horror movies you'll

be remembered for.

WHALE

I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.

KAY

No.  I never said you were.  Or

will be soon.

KAY

So.  "Journey's End" brought you to

Hollywood --

WHALE

I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This

mode of questioning is getting old,

don't you think?

KAY

I don't mind.

WHALE

Let's make it more interesting.  I

will answer any question you ask.

But, for each answer, you must

remove one article of clothing.

KAY

That's funny, Mr. Whale.

WHALE

It is, isn't it?  My life as a game

of strip poker.  Shall we play?

KAY

You're serious.

WHALE

Quite.

KAY

Then the rumors are true?

WHALE

What rumors might those be?

KAY

That you were forced to retire

because, uh -- a sex scandal.

WHALE

A homosexual scandal, you mean?

For me to answer a question of that

magnitude, you'll have to remove

both your shoes and your socks.

KAY

You're a dirty old man.

WHALE

You are kind to indulge your elders

in their vices.  As I indulge the

young in theirs.

WHALE

No.  There was no scandal.

WHALE

My only other vice.  I suppose

you'd like a fuller answer to your

question.

WHALE

It will cost you your sweater.

KAY

Too warm for a sweater, anyway.

WHALE

You must understand how Hollywood

was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared

a tinker's cuss who slept with

whom, so long as you kept it out of

the papers.  Outside of Hollywood,

who knows who George Cukor is, much

less what he does with those boys

from the malt shops along Santa

Monica?

KAY

George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is

Born"?  I never guessed.

WHALE

Take off your vest and I'll tell

you a story.

WHALE

Don't be shy.  There's time to stop

before you go too far.

KAY

I guess.

WHALE

George is famous for his Saturday

dinner parties.  Great artists,

writers, society folk, all rubbing

elbows with Hollywood royalty.  But

how many of those oh-so-proper

people know about the Sunday

brunches that follow?  Gatherings

of trade eating leftovers, followed

by some strenuous fun and frolic in

the pool.

(flicks an ash)

If a goat like that can continue

about his business, my more

domestic arrangements could've

raised very few eyebrows.

KAY

Can we talk about the horror movies

now?

WHALE

Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there

anything in particular you want to

know?

KAY

Will you tell me everything you

remember about making

"Frankenstein"?

KAY

Can that count as one question?

WHALE

Of course.

KAY

I can't believe I'm doing this.

KAY

Just like going swimming, isn't it?

WHALE

Maybe you'd like a swim when we're

through.  I never swim myself, so

the pool tends to go to waste.

KAY

Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me

everything.

WHALE

Righto.  Let me see.

WHALE

Universal wanted me for another

story, and wanted me so baldly -- I

mean badly, not baldly.  I was

given the pick of stories being

developed, and I picked that one.

KAY

Who came up with the Monster's

makeup and look?

WHALE

My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches.

Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top

so they could take out the old

brain and put in the new, like

tinned beef.

KAY

He's one of the great images of the

twentieth century.  As important as

the Mona Lisa.

WHALE

You think so?  That's very kind --

KAY

Boris Karloff.  Where did you find

him?

KAY

Karloff, Mr. Whale.  How did you

cast him?

WHALE

Please.  Excuse me.  I must go

lie --

KAY

Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?

WHALE

I just need to -- lie down.

Studio.  Daybed in studio.

KAY

Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr.

Whale?  Is it your heart?

WHALE

Head.  Not heart.

WHALE

Forgive me.

HANNA

Water.  Glasses at the sink.

HANNA

Which ones?  I bring them all.

WHALE

Luminal.

WHALE

Mr. Kay.  You're not dressed.

KAY

I was going to take a swim.

WHALE

I'm sorry I spoiled it for you.

You should probably go home.

KAY

Right.

WHALE

You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.

HANNA

I do not think you anything

anymore.  Just back from the

hospital and already you are

chasing after boys.

WHALE

Oh shut up.  All we did was talk.

My attack had nothing to do with

him.

HANNA

Perhaps we should get you uphill

before the pills knock you cold.

WHALE

No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you.

DWIGHT (O.S.)

Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.

CLAY

Fuck off!

DWIGHT (O.S.)

You told me to get you up, asshole.

CLAY

I'm up.  Thanks.

DWIGHT

Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give

the jail bait a squeeze for me.

CLAY

Hey, um...Rose --

DAISY

Daisy.

CLAY

Huh?

DAISY

My name is Daisy.

CLAY

Time to go, Daisy.

DAISY

You know.  I could help you fix up

this place real nice.

CLAY

Don't you have to be somewhere?

Like high school maybe.

DAISY

I gave it up for Lent.

CLAY

Right.

(jumps up from the bed)

Time to hit the road, kid.

WHALE (O.S.)

(singing)

The bells of hell go ting-a-ling...

WHALE

Everything alright, Mr. Boone?

CLAY

Just got away from me.  Sorry to

disturb you.

WHALE

I was just about to ask Hanna to

bring down iced tea.  I'd like it

very much if you'd join me.

CLAY

I stink to high heaven right now.

WHALE

The honest sweat of one's brow.  I

assure you I won't be offended.

Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for

two.

WHALE

Or would you prefer a beer?

CLAY

No.  Iced tea's fine.

WHALE

Splendid.

WHALE

Come in, Mr. Boone.

WHALE

My workshop, my studio.  Hardly

somewhere in which a sweaty workman

should feel out of place.

CLAY

These are your paintings?

WHALE

What?  Oh yes.

CLAY

Excuse me, but -- are you famous?

WHALE

You know what they say.  If you

have to ask --

CLAY

I'm just a hick who cuts lawns.

But some of these look familiar.

WHALE

They were familiar when I painted

them.  That one's copied from a

Dutch still life done almost three

hundred years ago.  And that's a

Rembrandt.

CLAY

They're just copies then.  Gotcha.

WHALE

But before I retired, you might say

I had a brief time in the sun.

Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you

like motion pictures?

CLAY

Sure, everybody does.  When I was a

kid I'd go with my sister twice a

week.  Why?  Were you an actor

or something?

WHALE

In my youth, yes, but never in

Hollywood.  No, I was merely a

director here.

CLAY

Yeah?  What were some of your

movies?

WHALE

This and that.  The only ones you

maybe have heard of are the

"Frankenstein" pictures.

CLAY

Really?

CLAY

"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and

"Son of" and all the rest?

WHALE

I made only the first two.  The

others were done by hacks.

CLAY

Still.  You must be rich.  Making a

couple of famous movies like those.

WHALE

Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna

with our refreshments.  Can you get

the door?

HANNA

How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy?

How is your mind today?

WHALE

My mind's lovely.  And yours?

HANNA

You remember what the doctor tells

us.

WHALE

Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited

Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea.

We'll have a brief chat and he'll

finish the yard.

HANNA

I am not forgetting your last brief

chat.

WHALE

Just go.  We can manage without

you.

HANNA

He looks plenty big.  You won't

need my help if anything goes

flooey.

WHALE

Go.

WHALE

When they stay in your employ too

long, servants begin to think

they're married to you.

(smiles at Clay)

Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.

CLAY

What did she mean by going flooey?

WHALE

I returned recently from a stay in

hospital.

CLAY

What was wrong?

WHALE

Nothing serious.  A touch of

stroke.

WHALE

You must excuse me for staring, Mr.

Boone.  But you have a marvelous

head.

CLAY

Huh?

WHALE

To an artistic eye, you understand.

Have you ever modeled?

CLAY

You mean, like posed for pictures?

WHALE

Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.

CLAY

(with a laugh)

What's to sketch?

WHALE

You have the most architectural

skull.  And your nose.  Very

expressive.

CLAY

Broke is more like it.

WHALE

But expressively broken.  How did

it happen?

CLAY

Football in college.

WHALE

You went to university?

CLAY

Just a year.  I dropped out to join

the Marines.

WHALE

Yes.  You were a Marine.

WHALE

I apologize for going on like this.

It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of

course I can understand your

refusal.  It's a great deal to ask

of someone.

CLAY

You mean -- you really want to draw

me?

WHALE

Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege

of drawing your head.

CLAY

But why?

WHALE

Even an amateur artist needs a

subject to inspire him.

CLAY

And it's just my head you want?

Nothing else?

WHALE

What are you suggesting?  You'll

charge extra if I include a hand or

a bit of shoulder.

CLAY

You don't want to draw pictures of

me in my birthday suit, right?

WHALE

I have no interest in your body,

Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of

that.

CLAY

All right then.  Sure.  I could use

the extra dough.

WHALE

Excellent.  We'll have a most

interesting time.

DR. PAYNE

This is the area of infarction.  By

which we mean the portion of brain

affected by the stroke.

DR. PAYNE

You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale.

Whatever damage was done by your

stroke, it left your motor

abilities relatively unimpaired.

WHALE

Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the

neck up?  What's my story there?

DR. PAYNE

That's what I'm trying to explain.

DR. PAYNE

The central nervous system selects

items from a constant storm of

sensations.  Whatever was killed in

your stroke appears to have

short-circuited this mechanism.

Parts of your brain now seem to be

firing at random.

WHALE

You're saying there's an electrical

storm in my head?

DR. PAYNE

That's as good a way as any to

describe it.  I've seen far worse

cases.  You might even learn to

enjoy these walks down memory lane.

WHALE

But the rest of it?  The killing

headaches.  The phantom smells.  My

inability to close my eyes without

thinking a hundred things at once.

It's all nothing more than bad

electricity?

DR. PAYNE

In a manner of speaking.  I've

never encountered the olfactory

hallucinations, but I'm sure

they're related.

WHALE

So what do I do?

DR. PAYNE

Take the Luminal to sleep, or

whenever you feel an attack coming

on.

WHALE

You seem to be saying that this

isn't just a case of resting until

I'm better.  That my condition will

continue to deteriorate until the

end of my life.

CLAY

Don't worry, you already paid me.

I'm here because --

HANNA

The Master is waiting for you.

HANNA

He's down in his studio.  Here.

Take this with you.

CLAY

It's your job, lady, not mine.

(hands back the tray)

I'm here so he can draw my picture.

HANNA

I'm keeping away.  What you are

doing is no business of mine.

CLAY

What're you talking about?

HANNA

What kind of man are you?  Are you

a good man?

CLAY

Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something

make you think I'm not?

HANNA

You will not hurt him?

CLAY

Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on

my ass while he draws pictures.  Is

that going to hurt him?

HANNA

No.  No.

(closes her eyes)

I am sorry.  Forget everything I

say.  Here.  I will take the tray.

CLAY

You do that.

WHALE

Very good, Hanna.  Now goodbye.

WHALE

I'm sure you'd like something to

wet your whistle while I work.

WHALE

We'll go slowly today.  Since this

is your first time as a model.

CLAY

Did you see this?  They're showing

one of your movies tomorrow night.

WHALE

You don't say?  Which picture?

CLAY

"Bride of Frankenstein."

WHALE

Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or

"The Invisible Man."  Shall we

begin?

CLAY

Ready when you are.

WHALE

That shirt, Mr. Boone.

CLAY

It's new.

WHALE

I'm sorry.  It's too white, too

distracting.  Would it be asking

too much for you to take it off?

CLAY

I'm not wearing an undershirt.

WHALE

Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your

Aunt Tilly.

CLAY

But it's just my face you want to

draw.

WHALE

Oh if it's going to make you

uncomfortable...

(sighs)

Perhaps we can find something else

for you to wear.

WHALE

We could wrap this like a toga

around your shoulders.  Would that

help you overcome your schoolgirl

shyness?

CLAY

All right already.  I'll take it

off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.

WHALE

Yes.  Much better.

(steps forward)

Here.

WHALE

I think we'll have you sit slightly

sideways, so you can rest one arm

on the back of the chair.  Yes.

Just so.

CLAY

Take a picture, it lasts longer.

WHALE

That's exactly what I intend to do.

WHALE

You seem to have no idea how

handsome you are, Mr. Boone.  It

has to do with how snugly your face

fits your skull.

WHALE

Would you be more comfortable

barefoot?  Feel free to remove your

boots and socks.

CLAY

No.  I'm fine.

WHALE

It's a bit like being at the

doctor, isn't it?  You have to

remain perfectly still while I

examine and scrutinize you.

WHALE

(to himself)

Dripping?

(to Clay)

Do you ever eat dripping in this

country?  The fat from roasts and

such, congealed in jars.  Used like

butter on bread.

CLAY

Sounds like something you feed the

dog.

WHALE

It is.  Only the poorest families

ever ate it.  We kept ours in a

crockery jar.

CLAY

Your family ate dripping?

WHALE

(catching himself)

Of course not.  As I said, only

poor people --

WHALE

I'm sorry.  I've just realized how

terribly ironic it all is.

CLAY

What?

WHALE

I've spent most of my life

outrunning my past.  Now it's

flooding all over me.

WHALE

There's something about the

openness of your face that makes me

want to speak the truth.  Yes, my

family ate dripping.  Beef dripping

and four to a bed, and a privy out

back in the alley.  Are you also

from the slums, Mr. Boone?

CLAY

We weren't rich.  But we weren't

poor either.

WHALE

No, you were middle class, like all

Americans.

CLAY

I guess you'd say we lived on the

wrong side of the tracks.

WHALE

In Dudley there were more sides of

the tracks than any American can

imagine.  Every Englishman knows

his place.  And if you forget,

there's always someone to remind

you.  My family had no doubts about

who they were.  But I was an

aberration in that household a

freak of nature.  I had imagination,

cleverness, joy.  Where did I get

that?  Certainly not from them.

WHALE

They took me out of school when I

was fourteen and put me in a

factory.  They meant no harm.  They

were like a family of farmers

who've been given a giraffe, and

don't know what to do with the

creature except harness him to the

plow.

WHALE

Hatred was the only thing that kept

my soul alive in that soul-killing

place.  And among those men I hated

was my own poor, dumb father.  Who

put me in that hell to begin with.

CLAY (O.S.)

Mr. Whale?

WHALE

You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone.

Since my stroke, I am often

overcome with nostalgia.

CLAY

I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about

my old man either.

WHALE

Why don't we break for five

minutes?  You probably want to

stretch your legs.

DWIGHT (V.O.)

So you just sat there while this

old limey banged his gums?

CLAY

I liked it.  You learn stuff

listening to old-timers.

DWIGHT

(to Harry)

You ever hear of this Whale fellow?

HARRY

Can't say that I have.  Can't say

I've heard of a lot of people

though.

CLAY

If you don't believe me, let's

watch this movie.  See if his

name's on it.  How about it, Harry?

Can I watch my damn movie?

HARRY

I told you.  I don't turn on the TV

except for the fights.

BETTY

A spooky movie.  Just what this

place needs tonight.

DWIGHT

Couldn't make it any deader, doll.

Set me up.

BETTY

Sure.  Your friend want one?

DWIGHT

Yeah, one for what's-his-name here.

CLAY

Thanks, doll.

BETTY

(to Harry)

I say let loverboy watch his

movie.  And be grateful Boone's

not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.

CLAY

Why is everybody giving me crap

tonight?

DWIGHT

Jesus, Boone.  You come in here

proud as a peacock because some old

coot wants to paint your picture.

We're just bringing you back to

earth.

BETTY

Sounds screwy to me.  I can't

imagine a real artist wanting to

spend time looking at that kisser.

CLAY

This kisser wasn't so bad you

couldn't lay under it a few times.

DWIGHT

Ooooh.

BETTY

I bet this is just some fruit

pretending to be famous.  So he can

get in the big guy's pants.

DWIGHT

Ooooh.

CLAY

What makes you say that?

BETTY

Just thinking out loud.

CLAY

Yeah, well keep your filthy

thoughts to yourself.

BETTY

All right, then.  He's interested

in you for your conversation.  We

know what a great talker you are.

CLAY

Fuck you.

BETTY

Not anymore you don't.  Doll.

CLAY

(explodes)

We're watching the movie, Harry.

You got that!  We are watching my

fucking movie.

HARRY

Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down.

We'll watch it.

CLAY

Good.  Fine.

CLAY

Right there.  What did I tell you?

James Whale.

BETTY

This looks corny.

CLAY

Go wash glasses if you don't like

it.

DWIGHT

Not bad.  Two down and it's just

started.

WHALE

Wonderful old Una.  Gobbling like

an old turkey hen.

HANNA

Oh, that monster.  How could you be

working with him?

WHALE

Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very

proper actor.  And the dullest

fellow imaginable.

BETTY

These old movies are such a hoot.

They thought they were being scary,

but they're just funny.

CLAY

(defensively)

Maybe it's supposed to be funny.

BETTY

Funny is funny and scary is scary.

You don't mix them.

CLAY

Hey!  Some of us are watching a

movie!

SAYLOR

Go ahead.  Free country.

SAYLOR

You want me to turn it down?

SAYLOR

Hey, I didn't know.  It's your

favorite movie.  Sorry, okay?

HARRY

You're like a dog with a bone over

this movie, Clay.

CLAY

I just want to watch it, okay?

HANNA

He is not going to kill the old

man?

WHALE

No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that

black.

WHALE

The cigars were my own brand.  So

that I could have the leftovers.

HARRY

Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder

if they knew how sick they were.

CLAY

The Monster's lonely and he wants a

friend, a girlfriend, somebody.

What sick about that?

BETTY

All right!  You don't want

him

.

HANNA

She is horrible.

WHALE

She is beautiful.

HANNA

Ugh.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy, but

your movie is not my teacup.

Still, I am glad there is a happy

ending.  The bad people are dead

and the good people live.

BETTY

Weird movie.  Weird, weird, weird.

CLAY

So what did you think?

BETTY

Weird.

DWIGHT

I loved it.  I want a switch like

that in my trailer, so I can blow

us to kingdom come when things

don't go my way.

DWIGHT

Damn but it's getting drunk in

here.  Late too.  The bride of

Dwight is going to bite my head

off.

DWIGHT

You coming, Boone?

CLAY

I think I'll hang around.

HARRY

Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.

CLAY

I thought I'd give you a hand since

I kept you open.

HARRY

I'm next door if you need me.

CLAY

You know what?  I think you guys

are all jealous.

BETTY

(laughs)

What's to be jealous of?

CLAY

I've gotten to know someone who's

famous.

BETTY

Not so famous any of us have ever

heard of him.

CLAY

If he were that famous, he probably

wouldn't give me the time of day.

This way, he's like

my

famous

person.

(laughs at himself)

Yeah, my own personal famous

person.  Who treats me like I'm

somebody worth talking to.

CLAY

You want to go for a swim?

CLAY

What's that mean?

BETTY

It means it's too cold to go

swimming.  And I don't mean the

water.

CLAY

I wasn't going to try anything.

BETTY

Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke

another cigarette.

CLAY

Let's go for a walk at least.  Walk

and talk.  I really feel like

talking tonight.

CLAY

This old guy -- he's the kind of

person I expected to meet when I

moved out here.  Someone who's done

things with his life.

BETTY

Do you realize you're more

interested in this old goober than

you ever were in me?

CLAY

It's different.  He's a man.  And

by the way you have no business

calling him a homo.

BETTY

It never crossed your mind?

CLAY

He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too

old to think about sex.

BETTY

All the old men I know think about

nothing but sex.

CLAY

C'mon.  What's eating you tonight?

BETTY

You picked up that girl right in

front of me.

CLAY

Hey, no strings, right?  That's

what you always said.  Just good

pals who have the hots for each

other.

BETTY

It still hurt.  A lot.

CLAY

I didn't mean to...

BETTY

No, I'm actually kind of glad it

happened.  It made me wonder what

the hell I was doing with my life.

Letting you pull me into bed

whenever the spirit moved you.

CLAY

You liked it too.

BETTY

Sure.  I loved it.

CLAY

If you enjoy it, you should do it.

BETTY

You know, I just can't do that

anymore.  I still have time to get

things right.  Get married again --

CLAY

You mean us?

BETTY

The look on your face!  You're not

marriage material.  You're not even

boyfriend material.  You're a kid.

A big, fun, slightly irresponsible

kid.

CLAY

I'm not a kid.

BETTY

What are you then?  What will you

be ten years from now?  Still

cutting lawns?  Still banging horny

divorcees in your trailer?

CLAY

I like my life.  I'm a free man.

BETTY

Sure you're free, for now at least.

But how long before you're just

alone?  Pathetic and alone.

CLAY

So you don't want to fuck.  That's

what you're telling me?

BETTY

Is that all this conversation means

to you?  Am I going to put out or

not?

CLAY

Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing

games.

CLAY

Betty, look.  This is coming out

all wrong --

BETTY

From here on out, Boone, you're

just another tired old face on the

other side of the bar.

CLAY

It's all shit!  Shit on by women!

Shit on by the Marines.  Shit on by

the world!  Fuck!

CLAY

Fuuuck!

HANNA

You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?

WHALE

I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.

HANNA

Good night.

HANNA

Oh no, Mr. Jimmy.

ELSA LANCHESTER

You done yet, love?  I am

absolutely dying for a fag.

BORIS KARLOFF

(gurgles)

Goo' 'orning, 'ames.

WHALE

Good morning.  And a very good

morning to you.

ELSA LANCHESTER

Uh-oh.  The way you look at me,

James.  What have you done this

time?

WHALE

Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride

feast upon her visage.

ELSA LANCHESTER

Boris?  Do I look a fright?

JACK

(nasal New Yorkese)

Behold, the Bride of Frankenstein.

ELSA LANCHESTER

Oh, James.

ELSA LANCHESTER

And you said there'd be some of me

left.  Nobody's going to know me in

this getup.

WHALE

Nonsense, my dear.  You look

extraordinary.

(to an assistant)

Today's script.  Quick.  And a

pencil.

WHALE

Jack, I want to get on this right

away.  Sorry, Boris, we won't get

to you until this afternoon.

BORIS KARLOFF

I 'ish you 'old 'e 'ooner.

BORIS KARLOFF

I could have spent the morning

tending to my roses.

ERNEST THESIGER

My God.  Is the audience to presume

that Colin and I have done her

hair?  I thought we were mad

scientists, not hairdressers.

ELSA LANCHESTER

Only a mad scientist could do this

to a woman.

ERNEST THESIGER

Oh no, my dear.  You look

absolutely amazing.  There's no way

I can compete with you.  The scene

is yours.

ELSA LANCHESTER

In the sequel, James, two lady

scientists should make a monster.

And our monster would be Gary

Cooper.

ERNEST THESIGER

I would've thought Mr. Leslie

Howard would be more your line.

ELSA LANCHESTER

More your line.

ERNEST THESIGER

My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin

Tin.  Dogs are so much more

dependable than men.

WHALE

Colin?  Please.  It's time.

(softly, to Thesiger)

How is he today?

ERNEST THESIGER

Stiff as a board.

(calls out)

Yes, Colin.  Come see what they've

done to our Elsa.

COLIN CLIVE

I'm not at my best today, Jimmy.

A touch of flu, you know.

WHALE

Relax, my boy.  You could do this

scene in your sleep.

ERNEST THESIGER

I gather we not only did her hair

but dressed her.  What a couple of

queens we are, Colin.

WHALE

Yes, a couple of flaming queens.

And Pretorius is a little in love

with Dr. Frankenstein, you know.

WHALE

Yes.  I think it's coming together.

Shall we have a go?

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

Quiet on the set!

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

Lights!

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

Sound!

SOUND MAN

Okay for sound.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

Camera!

CAMERA ASSISTANT

Scene two-fifteen.  Take one.

WHALE

Action.

ERNEST THESIGER

The Bride of Frankenstein!

WHALE

Luminal.  Illumine all.

WHALE

Thank you.  Thank you so much.

WHALE

It isn't working.  The experiment

is a failure.

CLAY

Just go to sleep.

WHALE

I'm up, Hanna.

WHALE

What in God's name --

CLAY

(angrily)

I told you to sleep.

WHALE

Does the yardman come today?

HANNA

Of course.  This afternoon.

CLAY

Something I can do for you?

HANNA

The Master wants to know if you are

free for lunch.  I tell him you

will be having other plans, but he

insists I ask.

CLAY

Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm

free until then.

HANNA

Expect nothing fancy.

HANNA

The Master is dressing.  I am to

offer you a drink.  There is

whiskey and there is iced tea.

CLAY

Tea is fine.

HANNA

No.  You are a guest now.  You go

in the living room.

CLAY

That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more

comfortable in here.  It is Hanna,

isn't it?

CLAY

How long you worked for Mr. Whale?

HANNA

Long enough.  Fifteen years.

CLAY

I bet you've seen a lot of famous

people come and go?  Movie stars?

HANNA

No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and

I.  People come to play bridge.

And now and then, young men to

swim.  You have people, Boone?

CLAY

You mean family?  All in Joplin,

Missouri.

HANNA

Your wife?

CLAY

I'm not married.

HANNA

Why?

CLAY

Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl

in her right mind will have me?

HANNA

A man who is not married has

nothing.  He is a man of trouble.

You need a woman.

CLAY

You proposing what I think you're

proposing?  Don't you think I'm a

little young for you?

HANNA

Men.  Always pulling legs.

Everything is comedy.

(mimics an English

accent)

"How very amusing.  How marvelously

droll."

CLAY

You ever been married, Hanna?

HANNA

Of course.  I am married still.

CLAY

Yeah?  What's your husband do?

HANNA

He is dead now, twenty years.

CLAY

Then you're as single as I am.

HANNA

No.  I have children, grandchildren

too.  I visit when I can.  But now

that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very

long, I do not get away much.

(sighs)

Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good

in him, but he will suffer the

fires of hell.  Very sad.

CLAY

You're sure of that?

HANNA

This is what the priests tell me.

His sins of the flesh will keep him

from heaven.

CLAY

Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has

those.

HANNA

No.  His is the worse.

(worse)

The unspeakable.  The deed no man

can name without shame?

HANNA

What is the good English?  All I

know is bugger.  He is a bugger.

Men who bugger each other.

CLAY

A homo?

HANNA

Yes!  You know?

HANNA

That is why he must go to hell.  I

do not think it fair.  But God's

law is not for us to judge.

CLAY

You're telling me Mr. Whale is a

homo.

HANNA

You did not know?

CLAY

Well...no, not really --

HANNA

You and he are not doing things?

CLAY

No!

HANNA

Good.  That is what I hope.  I did

not think you a bugger too.  I fear

only that you might hurt him if he

tries.

CLAY

I'm not going to hurt anyone.

HANNA

Yes.  I trust you.

HANNA

You must go in.  Quickly.  He will

not like to think I have had you in

the kitchen.

WHALE

How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad

you are free for lunch.

CLAY

All right, I guess.

WHALE

I assume you worked up an appetite

with your labor.

WHALE

Forgive my rudeness.  At my age,

the post is the cream of the day.

WHALE

Do you mind?

CLAY

Go ahead.

WHALE

Hmmm?  Princess Margaret?

WHALE

Her Majesty's Loyal Subjects in the

Motion Picture Industry...

Cordially invited...Reception at

the home of...Mr. George Cukor!

WHALE

That pushy little -- horning in on

the Queen's sister, then offering

to share her with the whole damn

raj?  I live in this country to get

away from this rubbish!

WHALE

Is this David's doing?

CLAY

This David's a friend?

WHALE

Yes.  An old, useless friend.  You

must excuse me, Mr. Boone.  This is

a world I finished with long ago.

I pay them no mind and expect them

to return the compliment.

(a deep breath)

Lunch should be ready.  Shall we?

WHALE

Cheers.

WHALE

Smells lovely, Hanna.

CLAY

Saw your movie the other night.

Watched it with some friends.

WHALE

Did you now?

CLAY

I liked it.  We all did.

WHALE

Did anyone laugh?

CLAY

(covering)

No.

WHALE

Pity.  People are so earnest

nowadays.

CLAY

Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?

WHALE

Of course.  I had to make it

interesting for myself, you see.  A

comedy about death.  The trick is

not to ruin it for anyone who isn't

in on the joke.

(a sip of wine)

But the Monster never receives any

of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble

and misunderstood.

WHALE

In Korea, Mr. Boone?

WHALE

Did you kill anyone?

CLAY

I don't like to talk about that.

WHALE

It's nothing to be ashamed of, in

the service of one's country.

That's something to be proud of.

CLAY

Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can

kill someone.

WHALE

Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is

the true test.  Did you ever slay

anyone hand-to-hand?

CLAY

(defensive)

No.  I could have, though.

WHALE

Yes, I believe you could.

(a sip of wine)

How free is your schedule this

afternoon?

CLAY

Full up.  I got the hedges to do

here, then another lawn out by La

Cienega.

WHALE

What is we say phooey to the

hedges?  Could you spare an hour

after lunch?  To sit for me?

CLAY

Can't today.

WHALE

I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what

you'd get if you did the hedges.

CLAY

Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting

still today.

WHALE

All righty.  I understand.

WHALE

Use this.

WHALE

Just a trim.  And mine while you're

at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff

today.

CLAY

You ever been married, Mr. Whale?

WHALE

No.  At least not in the legal

sense.

CLAY

So you had a wife?

WHALE

Or a husband.  Depending on which

of us you asked.  My friend David.

He lived here for many years.

WHALE

Does that surprise you?

CLAY

No, I -- you're a homosexual.

WHALE

Oh dear.  If one must have a

clinical name.

CLAY

I'm not, you know.

WHALE

I never thought you were.

CLAY

You don't think of me that way, do

you?

WHALE

What way might that be?

CLAY

You know.  Look at me like -- like

I look at women.

WHALE

Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real

man like you would break my neck if

I so much as laid a hand on him.

Besides, you're not my type.

WHALE

So we understand each other?

CLAY

What you do is no business of mine.

Live and let live, I say.

WHALE

I hope this has nothing to do with

your refusing to sit for me today?

CLAY

No.  I --

WHALE

What are you afraid of, Mr. Boone?

Certainly not a frail old man like

me.

CLAY

Can I see what you did so far?

WHALE

It will only make you

self-conscious.  You'll have to

remove your shirt.

CLAY

Sorry.  Not today.

WHALE

But we have to match the other

sketch.

CLAY

I just feel more comfortable

keeping it on.  You just said you

didn't want me self-conscious.

WHALE

Perhaps if we open the shirt and

pull --

WHALE

Oh dear.  I

have

made you

nervous.

CLAY

I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it

on.

WHALE

Suppose we unbutton the top and

pull it down around your shoulders?

Two buttons.  Is that so much to

ask?  Just two little buttons.

CLAY

No!  Look.  What you told me at

lunch is still very weird for me.

So either you sketch me like I am

or I'll say forget it and go do

your hedges.

CLAY

I don't mean to be a prick, but

that's how I feel.

WHALE

Of course.  I don't want to scare

you off.  Not before I'm finished

with you.

WHALE

Tell me more about yourself, Mr.

Boone.  You have a steady

companion?

CLAY

Not at the moment.

WHALE

Why not?

CLAY

You know how it is.  You have to

kiss ass just to get a piece of it.

WHALE

Very well put.

CLAY

The world is just one kiss-ass game

after another.  A man has to make

up his own life, alone.

WHALE

Ah.  A philosopher.

CLAY

Thoreau with a lawnmower.

WHALE

(smiles)

I like that.  But take care, Mr.

Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much

like any other.  Too much can be a

very bad thing.

CLAY

Is that why you and your friend

split up?  Because you wanted to be

free?

WHALE

In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I

know it's why I stopped making

pictures.

WHALE

You might not think it to look at

me now, but there was a time when I

was at the very pinnacle of my

profession.  The horror movies were

behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat."

Major success.  Great box office.

Now I was to do something

important.  "The Road Back."  An

indictment of the Great War and

what it did to Germany.  It was to

be my masterpiece.

CLAY

What happened?

WHALE

The fucking studio butchered it.

It was 1937, Hitler's armies were

already massing -- and still the

New York bankers stood in line to

curry his favor.  Anything to avoid

losing the German market.  They cut

away the guts and brought in

another director to add slapstick.

The picture laid an egg, a great

expensive bomb.  For which I was

blamed.

WHALE

After that, I went out of fashion.

I was no longer able to command

the best projects, so I walked

away.  Why should I spend my time

working in such a dreadful business?

CLAY

Do you miss it?

WHALE

(dismissive)

It's so far in the past now.  Over

fifteen years --

WHALE

Making movies was the most

wonderful thing in the world.

Working with friends.

Entertaining people.  Yes, I

suppose I miss it.  More so now

that --

WHALE

I think we all want to feel we've

left our mark on the world.  Yes.

I wish I had done more work.

CLAY

You've done a helluva lot more

than most people.

WHALE

Better work.

WHALE

But I chose freedom.  David was

still in the thick of it, his life

full of anxiety and studio

intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending

my golden years as merely "the

friend."  The dirty little secret

of a nervous producer.

CLAY

How long were you...?

WHALE

Twenty years.  Too long.  We were

like a play whose run outlasted the

cast's ability to keep it fresh.

So I finally decided to close down

the show.

WHALE

When all fetters are loosened, a

certain hedonism creeps in, don't

you think?  There was a period when

this house was overrun with young

men.  Some even posed for me.

Right where you're sitting now.

WHALE

Of course, they weren't nearly as

bashful.  No, this room was once

filled with bare buttocks.  And

pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --

CLAY

Cut it out!

CLAY

Fuck it.  I can't do this anymore.

CLAY

Isn't it enough you told me you're

a fairy?  Do you have to rub my

nose in it?

WHALE

I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant

no --

CLAY

From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your

grass and that's it.  Understand?

YOUNG MAN

Come on, Jimmy.  Watch me dive.

WHALE

I think I'll just rest for a

moment.

WHALE

I think we're ready to go.

WHALE

You're up, Mr. Boone.

WHALE

The extras are in their places.

Now we need the star.  Wouldn't

you like to get in the pool?

CLAY

You first.

WHALE

Oh no.  I never swim.

WHALE

You'll have to remove that shirt.

CLAY

Do you mind turning on a light?

It's getting pretty soupy out here.

OWNER

Should have been here when you said

you would.  You whack off a tow,

don't think about taking me to

court.

CLAY

You're lucky I even squeezed you in

today.

OWNER

Don't take that tone with me, bub.

There's Japs in this town that work

cheaper and do flowers too.

CLAY

Will you just turn on the porch

light?  Sir?

CLAY

Where's Betty?

HARRY

She took the night off.  Heavy

date.  Some guy she's had her eye

on for a while.

CLAY

Thanks a lot, pal.

CLAY

Dwight!

DWIGHT

Hey, Boone.

CLAY

Have a drink?

The

New York Times

.  He glances at an article from

LIBRARIAN

Here are the trade newspapers you

wanted.

WHALE

Who was that at the door?

HANNA

A visitor.

WHALE

Thank you, Hanna.  That will be

all.

WHALE

Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut

the lawn until Wednesday.

CLAY

I'd like to sit for you again.  But

only if you ease up on the locker

room talk.  Okay?

WHALE

Scout's honor.

WHALE

I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What

convinced you to come back?

CLAY

I don't know.  I guess I like your

stories.

WHALE

Everybody has stories to tell.

CLAY

Not me.

WHALE

What about your stint in Korea?

I'm sure it was full of dramatic

episodes.

CLAY

I told you.  I don't like to talk

about that.

WHALE

And the fear you showed at our last

session?  How did you overcome

that?

CLAY

Not fear.  More like disgust.

WHALE

Same difference, Mr. Boone.

Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all

part of the great gulf that stands

between us.  Am I right in assuming

that you've had little experience

with men of my persuasion?

CLAY

There's no people like you in my

crowd.

WHALE

No teammates in football?  No

comrades in Korea?

CLAY

You must think the whole world is

queer.  Well it's not.  War sure

isn't.

WHALE

Oh, there may not be atheists in

the foxholes, but there are

occasionally lovers.

CLAY

You're talking through your hat

now.

WHALE

Not at all.  I was in the foxholes

myself.

CLAY

You were a soldier?

WHALE

I was an officer.

CLAY

This was World War I?

WHALE

No, my dear.  The Crimean War.

What do you think?  The Great War.

You had a Good War, while we had --

WHALE

-- a war without end.  There were

trenches when I arrived, and

trenches when I left, two years

later.  Just like in the movies.

Only the movies never get the

stench of them.  The world reduced

to mud and sandbags and a narrow

strip of rainy sky.

(a dry snort)

But we were discussing something

else.  Oh yes.  Love in the

trenches.

WHALE

Barnett.  Was that his name?

Leonard Barnett.  He came to the

front straight from Harrow.  And he

looked up to me.  Unlike the

others, he didn't care that I was a

workingman impersonating his

betters.  How strange, to be

admired so blindly.  I suppose he

loved me.  But chastely, like a

schoolboy.

CLAY

Something happened to him?

WHALE

I remember one morning in

particular.  A morning when the sun

came out.

WHALE (V.O.)

Odd, how even there one could have

days when the weather was enough to

make one happy.  He and I were

standing on the fire step and I

showed him the sights of no-man's

land, through the periscope.  It

was beautiful.  The barbed wire was

reddish gold, the water in the

shell holes green with algae, the

sky a clear quattrocento blue.  And

I stood shoulder to shoulder with a

tall apple-cheeked boy who loved

and trusted me.

WHALE

Don't do this to me again, Mr.

Boone.  I absolutely refuse.

WHALE

You will not set me on another walk

down memory lane.  Not this lane.

Not today.

CLAY

I didn't --

WHALE

Why do I tell you this?  I never

told David.  I never even

remembered it until you got me

going.

CLAY

You're the one who started it.

WHALE

You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You

just sit there and let me talk.

What a sorry old man, you're

thinking.  What a crazy old poof.

(comes closer)

Why are you here?  What do you want

from me?

CLAY

You asked me to model.  Remember?

WHALE

Of course I remember.  Do you think

I'm so senile --

CLAY

Mr. Whale?  Are you okay?

WHALE

Stupid.  Very stupid.  What have I

been thinking?

WHALE

Just go.  Please.  Why don't you

go?

CLAY

I don't get it.  First you creep me

out with homo shit.  Then you hit

me with war stories.  And now

you're upset because I listen?

What do you want?

WHALE

I want -- I want...

WHALE

I want a glass of water.

WHALE

A touch of headache.

WHALE

Thank you.

WHALE

My apologies.  I had no business

snapping at you.

CLAY

No harm done.

WHALE

It was foolishness to attempt this

portrait.  You cannot force what

will not flow.

CLAY

You don't want me to sit for you

anymore?

WHALE

How would you like to come to a

party with me?  A reception for

Princess Margaret.

CLAY

I thought you weren't going.

WHALE

If you don't mind driving, I'd like

to take you as my guest.  There

should be lots of pretty starlets

to keep you amused.

CLAY

I'm game.  Sure.

WHALE

Very good, Clayton.  May I call you

Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?

CLAY

Clayton is fine.

CLAY

Mom?  Yeah, it's me.

CLAY

No, I'm not in jail...I don't want

any money, no...

(louder, to be heard)

Look, is Sis there?  I want to tell

her about this movie person I met

out here.  She'll get a kick out of

it.

CLAY

No, I still...I'd give you my phone

number if I had a phone --

CLAY

How's the old man?

CLAY

Right.

CLAY

Time's up.  I better go.

HANNA

Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting

friend.

WHALE

I'd hardly call our yardman a

friend.

HANNA

No.  But someone you can talk to.

WHALE

Do you miss having someone to talk

to, Hanna?

HANNA

I have my family.  Also our Lord

Jesus Christ.

WHALE

Of course.  How is the old boy

these days?

WHALE

It needs a hat.  There was a

wide-brimmed cream fedora...

HANNA

It must be up in your old room.  I

will look.

WHALE

Gas masks on.  Gas masks on.

BARNETT

Don't mind me, Lieutenant.  Save

yourself.

HANNA

Oh, Mr. Jimmy.  You make a mess of

it.  Here.

HANNA

(stacking boxes)

That is my daughter.  She say she

and her husband are coming to town

this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr.

Jimmy.  I will make it short.

WHALE

I'll be out this afternoon,

remember?  Your family can visit as

long as they like.

HANNA

No.  I do not cook for them.  My

daughter's no-good husband will not

take one bite of our food.

WHALE

You can toss this one in the trash.

WHALE

Good afternoon, Clayton.

CLAY

Do I look okay?

WHALE

You look splendid, my boy.  Quite

splendid.

WHALE

I suppose you'd like the top down.

CLAY

If that's okay?

WHALE

Nothing would please me more.

WHALE

Stars, you know.  The suns of other

galaxies.

WHALE

Good old George.  He loves to put

on the dog.  Only his dogs tend to

have a bit of mutt.

WHALE

What did I tell you?  Listen.

CLAY

I don't hear anything.

WHALE

Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to

hire music.  There's nothing but

chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard

of English chin-wag.

WHALE

Slim pickings.  Well, it's early

yet.  Perhaps this is a good time

to pay our respects.

WHALE

Let's get this over with quickly.

PRINCESS MARGARET

I had no idea you'd be here.

PRINCESS MARGARET

How are you?

WHALE

(taken aback)

Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal

Highness?

PRINCESS MARGARET

Splendid.  Now that I know you're

around.

PRINCESS MARGARET

Can we get together while I'm in

town?  I so badly want to sit for

you again.

WHALE

Sit?

PRINCESS MARGARET

I've changed my hair, you see.

Since our last session.  Those old

snaps look rather dowdy now.

PRINCESS MARGARET

Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?

WHALE

Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James

Whale.

PRINCESS MARGARET

(laughs)

I am such a goose.  I mistook you

for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat.

You're wearing one of Cecil's hats,

you know.

WHALE

Hello, George.  James Whale.  David

Lewis's friend.  I once made

pictures myself, Ma'am.

GEORGE CUKOR

Yes.  Of course.  One can't throw a

rock in this town without hitting

one of us old movie directors.

WHALE

Ma'am, may I present Mr. Clayton

Boone?

WHALE

My gardener, who insisted I bring

him today.  He so wanted to meet

royalty.

CLAY

Pleased to meet you.

PRINCESS MARGARET

Quite.  I adore gardens.

WHALE

He's never met a princess.  Only

queens.

WHALE

George, Ma'am, this has been an

honor.  An occasion to remember for

the rest of my days.

CLAY

What was that about?

WHALE

Nothing of importance.  Just two

old men slapping each other with

lilies.  Shall we have a drink?

CLAY

Who's that?

WHALE

David.  The friend I thought was in

New York.

CLAY

No.  The girl.

WHALE

Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.

CLAY

Is that really her?

WHALE

David produced her last picture.

DAVID

What are you doing here?

WHALE

Just what I was about to ask you.

I thought you were in New York.

DAVID

I was, until last night.  Publicity

asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for

today's reception.

DAVID

David Lewis.

CLAY

Clay Boone.

WHALE

Our yardman.  Who was kind enough

to serve as my escort to George's

little do.

DAVID

Should you be drinking in your

condition?

WHALE

Oh, David, stop being a nanny.

CLAY

I think I'll go look at Elizabeth

Taylor.

WHALE

You should have seen Georgie's face

when he met Clayton.

DAVID

You didn't, Jimmy.

WHALE

I did.  But Princess Margaret was a

doll.  We're all equals in her

eyes.  As commoners, I presume.

DAVID

You only embarrass yourself.

WHALE

Oh dear.  I'll never work in this

town again?

DAVID

You know what I mean.  Your

reputation.

WHALE

But I have no reputation.  I'm as

free as the air.

DAVID

Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't

you remember that?

WHALE

No.  I never could.  You must

regret having had the invitation

sent.

DAVID

I didn't ask George to invite you.

WHALE

Then who did?

DAVID

Jimmy, there are people here I need

to speak to.  You'll be fine on

your own?

WHALE

Yes.  Perfectly.

DAVID

All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow

for breakfast.

KAY

Mr. Whale!

WHALE

Mr....Kay?

KAY

Bet you thought you'd never see me

again.  I didn't know if you'd be

well enough to come to this party.

WHALE

You didn't?

KAY

I'm the one who got you on Mr.

Cukor's guest list.

WHALE

You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know

George Cukor?

KAY

I interviewed him after I met you.

I'm his social secretary now.

Well, assistant to his secretary.

WHALE

I commend you.  If you're going to

pursue poofs, go after those who

can do favors for you.  You waste

everybody's time when you court

dinosaurs.

KAY

Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I

love your movies.  That's why I

wanted you to come to this.  So I

could see you with your monsters.

WHALE

My monsters?

KAY

Don't go away.

ELSA LANCHESTER

Jimmy.  How are you?

WHALE

Elsa?

ELSA LANCHESTER

I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago.

She said you'd been under the

weather.

WHALE

Oh, nothing out of the ordinary.

Growing old.

ELSA LANCHESTER

We're all getting a bit long in the

tooth.

WHALE

But you appear quite fresh, my

dear.

ELSA LANCHESTER

Please.  You shouldn't stand on my

account.

WHALE

Perfectly all right.  But if you'd

like to sit --

ELSA LANCHESTER

I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a

few minutes.

WHALE

Of course.

ELSA LANCHESTER

What's our pesky friend up to now?

ELSA LANCHESTER

Is that Boris?  Our little chum

appears to be arranging a reunion.

WHALE

Oh dear.

ELSA LANCHESTER

Boris, darling.  I didn't know you

were here.  These public revels are

hardly up your alley.

BORIS KARLOFF

I came for the sake of my visiting

niece.  Alice.  And Miranda, my

great-niece.

ELSA LANCHESTER

And what do you make of our royal

visitant?

BORIS KARLOFF

Perfectly charming.  A real lady.

ELSA LANCHESTER

Of course she's a lady.  What did

you expect?  A hussy in tennis

shoes?

KAY

Hey, you!  With the camera!  We got

a historical moment here.  Come get

a picture of it.

KAY

This is Mr. James Whale, who made

"Frankenstein" and "Bride of

Frankenstein."  and this is the

Monster and his Bride.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Oh, Karloff.  Right.

ELSA LANCHESTER

(through clenched teeth)

Don't you just love being famous?

ELSA LANCHESTER

Are you all right, Jimmy?

PHOTOGRAPHER

Let me get one with Frankenstein

holding the kid.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Got it!

BORIS KARLOFF

So good to see you again, James.

KAY

Catch you before you go, Mr. Whale.

I'll make sure everybody gets sent

a print.

ELSA LANCHESTER

We'll be in touch, Jimmy.

WHALE

Good-bye.  So nice to see you...

CLAY

You okay?

WHALE

Tired.  A bit tired.

WHALE

Are you enjoying yourself?

CLAY

Actually, no.  I feel a little out

of place.

WHALE

Neither of us really belongs here.

CLAY

Must have been funny for you.

Seeing your monsters again.

WHALE

Monsters?  The only monsters...

(closes his eyes)

...are here.

CLAY

Oh fuck.  And we left the top down.

You want to run for it?

WHALE

Run for what?

CLAY

Can't you see?  It's raining!

CLAY

Here.

CLAY (O.S.)

Mr. Whale?

WHALE

Let's get out of this funk hole

CLAY

You don't want to wait it out?

Rain should let up soon.

WHALE

We're not sugar.  We won't melt.

CLAY

I better get you home before you

catch your death from pneumonia.

WHALE

Catch my death.

CLAY

You all right, Mr. Whale?

WHALE

Jimmy.  Please.  Call me Jimmy.

WHALE

Hanna!  Bring us some towels.

We're drenched to the bone!

WHALE

Blast her.  If we soil her holy

floor, it's her own damn fault.

WHALE

I don't believe this.

WHALE

It's not like her.

CLAY

(reading)

Just a night out.  Sounds like she

can't say no to her daughter.

WHALE

Certainly you have better things to

do than babysit an old man?

CLAY

Good.  Let's get dry.

WHALE

What do you think?

CLAY

Mr. Whale?

CLAY

Where's those clothes you promised?

WHALE

He trusts me, you know.

CLAY

Mr. Whale?  Jimmy?

CLAY

Mr. Whale?

WHALE

Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You

finished your shower already?

CLAY

Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear

me calling?

WHALE

I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.

(stands)

I believe I promised you some

clothes.

WHALE

You're much wider than I am.  You

won't want to attempt to get into

my pants.

CLAY

No.  Definitely not.

WHALE

Very good, Clayton.

WHALE

I know.

WHALE

Absolutely swims on me, but should

take care of your upper half.

WHALE

That only leaves the rest.

CLAY

You don't have any baggy shorts?

Pajama bottoms?

WHALE

Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored.

Would it be too distressing to

continue with the towel?  No more

immodest than a kilt, you know.

CLAY

Do I have any other choice?

WHALE

Very sporting of you, Clayton.

CLAY

Is that --?

WHALE

(nods)

The only memento I ever kept.  My

original sketch for the Monster.

WHALE

Shall we?

WHALE

After dinner, if Hanna isn't back?

Can we try a few more sketches?

CLAY

I thought you'd given up on my

picture.

WHALE

I'd like to try again.  If you're

game.

CLAY

Why not?  Give us something to do

while we wait.

WHALE

Tell me something, Clayton.  Do

you believe in mercy killing?

CLAY

Never gave it much thought.

WHALE

Come now.  I'm sure you came across

such situations in Korea.  A

wounded comrade, or perhaps one of

the enemy?  Someone for whom death

would be a blessing.

CLAY

I never went.

CLAY

I never made it to Korea.

WHALE

But you said --

CLAY

-- that I was a Marine.  Which is

true.  You filled in the rest.

WHALE

I see.

CLAY

My old man was a Marine.  He

enlisted the day he turned

seventeen.

WHALE

The Great War?

CLAY

(nods)

By the time he was ready to ship

out, the fighting was over.  He

missed out.

WHALE

A very lucky thing indeed.

CLAY

That's not the way he saw it.  To

him, it was like his life never got

started.  Nothing else really

mattered.  Definitely not his

family.

CLAY

The morning after Pearl Harbor, he

drove down to St. Louis to

reenlist.  He was so damn excited.

World War II was going to be his

second chance.

(sighs)

They told him he was too old...fat

...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more

use to his country if he stayed

home and looked after his family.

WHALE

Is that why you joined the Marines?

For your father's sake?

CLAY

I figured he'd think, you know --

it was the next best thing.  Hey, I

loved it too.  A chance to be a

part of something important.

Something bigger than yourself.

WHALE

What happened?

CLAY

I didn't have the guts for it.

CLAY

I mean, literally.  My body

screwed me up.  Burst appendix.

They gave me a medical discharge.

All I thought about was, how am I

going to tell the old man.

CLAY

You know what he did when I called

him?  He laughed.  He laughed so

hard he practically burst a blood

vessel.  Said it was a good lesson

for me.  Not to try to fill his

shoes.

WHALE

I'm very sorry.

CLAY

Them's the breaks, right?  No war

stories for this pup.

WHALE

That's where you're wrong, Clayton.

You've just told one.  A very good

story indeed.

CLAY

Do you mind?

WHALE

Not at all.

CLAY

Storm's getting worse.

WHALE

"A perfect night for mystery and

horror.  The air itself is filled

with monsters."

CLAY

That's from your movie, right?

"The only monsters are here."

WHALE

I don't remember that one.

CLAY

James Whale.  This afternoon at the

party.

CLAY

I said it must be weird seeing your

monsters again, and you said, "The

only monsters are here."  I was

wondering which here you meant.

WHALE

I don't recall.  Memories of the

war, perhaps.

CLAY

But that was so long ago.  It can't

still bother you.

WHALE

Oh, but it does.  Especially in

light of the journey I'm about to

make.

CLAY

You're planning a trip?

WHALE

Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.

CLAY

Your friend?

WHALE

He caught his one night coming back

from the reconnoiter.  I wouldn't

take him out, but McGill did.  Just

to give the lad a taste.  They were

nearly home when a Maxim gun opened

fire.

WHALE

(through clenched teeth)

Come on.  Come on.

WHALE (V.O.)

Barnett's body fell in wire as

thick as briers.  It was hanging

there the next morning, a hundred

yards from the line, too far out

for anyone to fetch it.

WHALE

We saw him at morning stand-to and

evening stand-to.  "Good morning,

Barnett," we'd say each day.

"How's ole Barnett looking this

morning?"  "Seems a little peaky.

Looks a little plumper."  His

wounds faced the other way and his

hat shielded his eyes, so one could

imagine he was napping on

bedsprings.  He hung there until we

were relieved.  We introduced him

to the new unit before we marched

out, speaking highly of his

companionship.

WHALE

Oh, but we were a witty lot.

Laughing at our dead.  Telling

ourselves it was our death too.

But with each man who died, I

thought, "Better you than me, poor

sod."

(bitterly)

A whole generation was wiped out by

that war.  Millions and millions of

young men.

WHALE

Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling?

Grave where thy victory?

CLAY

You survived it.  It can't hurt you

now.  It's no good to dig it up.

WHALE

Oh no, my friend.  It's digging

itself up.  There is nothing in the

here and now to take my mind off

it.  All my diversions have

abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading.

Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone

to me now.

CLAY

You wanted to draw me like a Greek

statue.  All right, then.

CLAY

There.  Not so bad.

WHALE

So it is going to happen after all.

CLAY

What'd you say?

WHALE

No.  It won't do.

CLAY

What won't do?

WHALE

You are much too human.

CLAY

What did you expect?  Bronze?

WHALE

Don't move.

WHALE

I would like you to wear this?

CLAY

Why?

WHALE

For the artistic effect.  The

combination of your human body and

that inhuman mask.  It's quite

striking.

CLAY

I don't know.

WHALE

Please, Clayton.  Just for a

minute.  Long enough for me to see

the effect.

CLAY

It's from the first World War,

isn't it?

WHALE

(nods)

There are straps in back.

WHALE

Let me help you.

CLAY

Now what?

CLAY

All right.  Let's take it off now.

WHALE

What was that?

CLAY

It's too tight.

WHALE

Allow me.

WHALE

We don't want to tear the straps.

WHALE

Oh yes.  I am still here.

WHALE

What steely muscles, Clayton.

CLAY

Just take off the fucking mask!

WHALE

Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you.

I can't hear a word.

WHALE

What a solid brute you are.

WHALE

No?  Maybe this, then?

WHALE

Oh yes.  I have you now.

CLAY

Get the fuck off!

WHALE

What will you do to get yourself

back?

CLAY

I'm not that way.  Get it through

your fucking head.  I don't want to

mess with you.

WHALE

Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.

WHALE

That didn't even sting.  You're not

such a real man after all.  Are

you?

WHALE

Wait until I tell my friends I had

you naked in my arms.  Won't they

be surprised?

CLAY

I haven't done a damn thing with

you!

WHALE

Oh, but you have.  You undressed

for me.  I kissed you.  I even

touched your prick.  How will you

be able to live with yourself?

CLAY

What the hell do you want from me?!

WHALE

I want you to kill me

.

WHALE

Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It

would be oh so easy to wrap your

hands around my neck and choke the

life out of me.  Please, Clayton.

We've come this far.

CLAY

You're crazy.

WHALE

Exactly, I'm losing my mind.

Every day, another piece goes.

Soon there will be nothing left.

Look at the sketch I made of you.

CLAY

Look, if you want to die do it

yourself!

WHALE

No, I don't want to die alone.  But

to be killed by you -- that would

make death bearable.  They say you

never see the one with your name on

it.  But I want to see death coming

at me.  I want it to be sharp and

hard, with a human face.  Your

face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my

second Monster.  Almost as famous

as the first.  It would be the

great adventure you've yearned for.

A war story for both of us to

share.

WHALE

You'd be fully exonerated, I've

taken care of that.  I wrote a

note, I'll even leave you the

house, the car...

WHALE

Do it now, Clayton.  Make me

invisible.

CLAY

I am not your monster.

WHALE

What have I done?

(sits up)

Oh, selfish, selfish fool.  I

have

lost my mind.

WHALE

What was I thinking?

WHALE

You're a softhearted bloke.  A

bloody pussycat.

WHALE

My deepest apologies.  Can you ever

forgive me?

WHALE

I suppose not.

(a bone-crushing sigh)

Good God, I am tired.  I really

must go to bed.

CLAY

You okay?

WHALE

Oh Clayton.

CLAY

Did I hurt you?

WHALE

Nothing I didn't deserve.

CLAY

Need some help?

WHALE

Pray you, undo this button.

WHALE

I can never manage it when I'm

tired.

WHALE

Do you believe people come into our

lives for a reason?

WHALE

I can undress myself, thank you.

CLAY

(steps back)

All right.

WHALE

When you die...be sure your brain

is the last organ to fizzle --

CLAY

You'll feel better tomorrow.

WHALE

Tomorrow and tomorrow and

tomorrow...

WHALE

Goodnight, Clayton.

HANNA

Hello?  Oh, Mr. David!

HANNA

No, no, he did not tell me.  But no

problem.  I will make breakfast.

HANNA

Ten?  Very good, then.  Good-bye.

CLAY

It's not what you think.

HANNA

I have brought you your clothes.

All I ask is that you get dressed

and go.  We are having a guest for

breakfast.

CLAY

I need to talk to you about Mr.

Whale.

HANNA

There is nothing you can say that

will surprise me.

CLAY

Maybe.  But I still need to talk.

Do I have time for a cup of coffee

before I go?

HANNA

I blame my daughter for keeping me

out so late.  I only hope you did

not get him excited.  It could give

him a new stroke.

CLAY

Thanks.

(quickly)

Why do you do it?

HANNA

What do I do?

CLAY

Take care of Mr. Whale like he was

your flesh and blood.

HANNA

It is my job.  I did it when he was

happy and it was easy.  It is only

fair I do it now when he is ill.

(picks up the tray)

Enough talk.  I must wake up the

master.

HANNA (O.S.)

Mr. Jimmy?  Morning, Mr. Jimmy.

HANNA

What have you done with him?

CLAY

I put him to bed.  He's not there?

HANNA

Mr. Jimmy!  Mr. Jimmy!

HANNA

Look for him!

CLAY

No.

CLAY

Almost there.  Almost there.

CLAY

Son of a bitch.  You crazy son of a

bitch.

HANNA

Ohhh!

CLAY

I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.

HANNA

Oh, Mr. Jimmy.

CLAY

He wanted me to kill him, but I

didn't.  He did it himself.

HANNA

He says here good-bye.  I find it

in his room.  He is sorry, he says.

He has had a wonderful life.

HANNA

You poor, foolish man.  You

couldn't wait for God to take you

in his time?

HANNA

You must leave.  You were not here

this morning.

CLAY

But I didn't do this!

HANNA

The police will not know that.

They will want to investigate.

CLAY

We have his note.

HANNA

Do you want to be questioned about

you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please,

Clayton.  It will be better if I

find the body alone.

CLAY

But how're you going to explain

this?

(points at the body)

How did you get him out of the

pool?

HANNA

You are right.  Yes.  We must put

him back.

HANNA

Poor Mr. Jimmy.  We do not mean

disrespect.  You will keep better

in water.

BLIND MAN

Who is it?  You're welcome, my

friend, whoever you are.

BLIND MAN

I cannot see you.  I cannot see

anything.  You must please excuse

me.  But I am blind.

BLIND MAN

Come in, my poor friend.  No one

will hurt you here.  If you're in

trouble, perhaps I can help you.

BLIND MAN

Can you not speak?  It's strange.

Perhaps you're afflicted too.  I

cannot see and you cannot speak.

BLIND MAN (O.S.)

It's been a long time since any

human being came into this hut.  I

shall look after you.  And you will

comfort me.

BLIND MAN

We are friends, you and I.

Friends.

MONSTER

Friends.

BLIND MAN

Before you came, I was all alone.

It is bad to be alone.

MONSTER

Alone, bad.  Friend, good.

MONSTER

Friend, good.

CLAY

Time for bed, sport.

CLAY

What'd you think of the movie?

MICHAEL

Pretty cool.  Better than most

monster movies.

CLAY

I knew the guy who made it.

MICHAEL

Come on, Dad.  Is this another one

of your stories?

CLAY

Here.

CLAY

It's his original sketch of the

Monster.

MICHAEL

This is for real?

DANA

The trash, Clay.  Before it rains.

CLAY

Okay.

CLAY

Off to bed.
