HENRY GEIN (O.S.)

We're just lucky it didn't reach the

trees...

HENRY GEIN (CONT'D)

There's gonna be a lot more jobs at that

factory by Milwaukee come June. I could

put in a word.

ED GEIN

You can't leave us, Henry. She needs both

OF US--

HENRY GEIN

Can you stop being a momma's boy for one

second?

HENRY GEIN (CONT'D)

I'm not trying to hurt you but Jesus you

got to live your own life someday. That

woman can take care of her own goddamn --

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Good evening.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Brother has been slaying brother since

Cain and Abel, yet even I did not see

that coming. I was as blind-sided as poor

Henry over there.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Apparently the authorities shared my

naivete and believed the young man's tale

that Henry fell and hit his head on a

stone and died of smoke asphyxiation.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Of course if they hadn't believed him, Ed

never would have had the opportunity to

commit the heinous acts for which he

became famous... and we wouldn't have our

little movie. Instead, we'd have more

nice, safe, predictable ones like

these...

CUT TO:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Mere Technicolor baubles.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Ah. A bit of doom and gloom. Now, that's

more like it.

WE --

CUT TO :

LEW WASSERMAN

This thing is going to be gigantic. I

wish I had twenty percent of the take.

REPORTER ONE

Does tonight's incredible reaction

surprise you, Mr. Hitchcock?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

No, when I was planning North by

Northwest I could already hear the

screams and laughter.

(then, to a BEAUTIFUL

BLONDE FAN)

Any questions, my dear?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

A pity.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REPORTER TWO

Mr. Hitchcock, you've directed forty-six

motion pictures. You host a hit TV show

seen around the world. You're the most

famous director in the history of the

medium... but you're sixty years old.

Shouldn't you just quit while you're

ahead?

HITCHCOCK

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALMA

Muhammad had the eyes of peeping Toms

gouged out with arrows.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Talking of arrows, did you read Mr.

Weiler's review in the New York Times?

Apparently, he found "the climax" to be --

and I quote -- "overdrawn."

ALMA

I doubt whether Mr. Weiler has had a

climax in years.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

And how about this little grenade?

(READING)

North by Northwest reminds us of

Hitchcock's earlier, more youthfully

inventive spy thrillers."

(BEAT)

And just to drive the nail into the

coffin, there's a handy accompanying

guide to the new masters of suspense.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Why do they keep looking for new masters

of suspense when they still have the

original?

ALMA

Don't be maudlin, you know how much it

aggravates me.

ALMA (CONT'D)

Stop reading them. You've been reading

them for a week now.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Tell me, dear. Am I really too old?

ALMA

Yes. A true relic. And lest we forget, a

notably corpulent one.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

You always know precisely where to plunge

the dagger, don't you?

ALMA

Right between the shoulder blades. I

learned it from your pictures.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Where are you off to?

ALMA

I'm seeing Whit for brunch after I drop

you off at the studio. Why don't you join

us?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

We've just established that I'm too

corpulent to be seen in broad daylight.

ALMA

You'll feel better as soon as you find a

project. Hasn't Peggy unearthed any

decent books yet?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Sleeping pills with dust jackets.

ALMA

Well?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Very presentable.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)

ON ALMA

ALMA

Hurry up, darling. You're pruning.

FIRST GUARD

Mr. Hitchcock. Mrs. Hitchcock.

FIRST GUARD (CONT'D)

(to the dogs)

Sirs.

ALMA

There's a story out there waiting for you

somewhere, Hitch. I promise.

ALMA (CONT'D)

Don't forget your lunch.

OMITTED

PEGGY

Fox is offering you The Diary of Anne

Frank for the third time.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

The audience would spend the entire

picture waiting for Miss Frank to

discover the corpse I'd hidden in the

attic. Wouldn't you agree, Silvio?

SILVIO

Si.

PEGGY

MGM wants you for the Ian Fleming book,

Casino Royale, with Cary Grant.

Definitely your style.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

(again, turning to Silvio)

Doesn't she know I just made that movie?

It's called North by Northwest. And

"style" is merely self-plagiarism.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

I'm treading water, Peggy. I need

something fresh. Something different.

Without expensive stars like Cary Grant

or Miss Kim Novak to pretty it up.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

A nice, clean, nasty little piece of

work.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

PEGGY

I'll see what I can find.

WHITFIELD COOK

... Thank God I had a pocketful of

pretzels. I was hiding in that props

cupboard all night.

(THEN)

That'll teach me to use a bedroom set

instead of the real thing.

ALMA

Serves you right.

ALMA (CONT'D)

Hitch always said your private life was

in danger of being more entertaining than

any of your plots.

WHITFIELD COOK

I can't believe he let me have you all to

myself for a whole afternoon. Especially

looking this beautiful.

WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)

Tres chic.

ALMA

All this relentless sycophancy is giving

me indigestion.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALMA (CONT'D)

(A SMILE)

What are you after?

ALMA (CONT'D)

And how is your wife?

WHITFIELD COOK

Elizabeth?

(his eyes return to Alma)

Over the moon since I promised her the

dedication in my new novel. So what are

you working on these days?

ALMA

Hitch is going out of his mind looking

for his next project. You know how

unbearable he is when he doesn't have

something lined up.

WHITFIELD COOK

Almost as unbearable as when he does.

ALMA

(LAUGHING)

Almost.

WHITFIELD COOK

I meant you. What are you working on?

ALMA

I'm satisfied spending time in my garden.

WHITFIELD COOK

That is one lucky garden.

WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)

Actually, I was hoping you might be able

to apply your considerable pruning skills

to this.

ALMA

Ah. All is finally revealed.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

WHITFIELD COOK

The most fun I ever had was working with

you.

ALMA

I suppose I could give it a look.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Anything. Anything at all?

PEGGY

Nothing suitable. Is that water or do I

need to call Alma?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Gin. Mother's ruin.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Boucher says this "Psycho" book by Robert

Bloch is `fiendishly entertaining'.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

PEGGY

It sounds ghastly. Everyone in town's

already passed.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

And who is everyone?

PEGGY

The story department finished the

coverage this morning.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Is this the one based on Ed Gein, the

serial killer?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

"Graphic elements of brutal violence,

voyeurism, transvestitism and incest."

Certainly not your average run of the

mill nutcase, is he?

PEGGY

You're kidding.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Peggy. This is the boy who dug up his own

mother.

ON HITCH

ALMA

Hungry?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Famished.

ALMA (O.S.)

If you're good, maybe you can have a

grapefruit later.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALMA (CONT'D)

Whit gave me the galleys of his new book

yesterday at lunch. I've already got some

ideas on how you could adapt it.

ALMA (CONT'D)

It's elegant, sophisticated, full of

INTRIGUE --

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

The book or Mr. Whitfield Cook?

ALMA

This might be the one, Alfred.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Leave it on the night stand.

ALMA

There are calories in that, you know.

ED GEIN

Aren't you cold, ma?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ED GEIN (CONT'D)

Don't be afraid, ma... I'm here...

ALMA

Oh God.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Read the bit in the motel bathroom.

ALMA

Now?

ALMA (CONT'D)

"Mary started to scream, and then the

curtains parted further and a hand

appeared, holding a butcher's knife. It

was the knife that, a moment later, cut

off her scream... and her head."

(handing him back the book)

Charming. Doris Day should do it as a

musical.

ALMA (CONT'D)

This is nothing but low-budget horror

movie claptrap.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

But what if someone really good made a

horror movie?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Just think of the shock value. Killing

off your leading lady halfway through.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

You're intrigued. Admit it.

ALMA

Actually, I think it's a huge mistake.

ALMA (CONT'D)

You shouldn't wait till halfway

through... Kill her off after 30 minutes.

OMITTED (SCENE 17)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Peggy, I want you to summon your

minions...

PEGGY

Minions. Certainly. And who might they

be...?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Get them started buying copies of

"Psycho."

PEGGY

How many do you need?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

All of them. I want every copy,

nationwide.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Have them scour every book shop and

library. "Psycho" is my next picture, and

I don't want anyone to find out the

ending until they see it in the theater.

PEGGY

All that celery's affecting your brain.

PEGGY (CONT'D)

Are you sure about this? This is so

unlike you.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

That's exactly the point, my dear.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (PRE-LAP)

And when the Wisconsin Police department

raided his farmhouse in Plainview...

HITCHCOCK

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)

..they opened the door only to discover -

voila...

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

... Ten female heads with the tops sawn

off, a dozen masks of human skin, and a

pair of lips on a drawstring for a window

shade.

HEDDA HOPPER TYPE

Is this really going to be you're next

picture, Mr. Hitchcock?

HITCHCOCK

That is my intention, madam. Yes.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I only wish he looked more like William

Holden and less like Elmer Fudd.

HEDDA HOPPER TYPE

Am I the only one who finds this

offensive?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I was hoping everyone would. I mean life

is deeply offensive and disgusting, isn't

it?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Try the finger sandwiches -- they're real

fingers.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Peggy. I'm going to need some research

detailing a typical unmarried 30-year-old

secretary from Phoenix, Arizona.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Her monthly rent, what she wears, what

she reads, which scent or perfume she

prefers...

PEGGY

... How she deals with a demanding boss

when she's trying to relax on her

weekends off?

LEW WASSERMAN

(re: the faces of the

GOSSIP COLUMNISTS)

I told you, Hitch. This thing's strictly

for the drive-in crowd.

WHITFIELD COOK

Now, if this were a Hitchcock picture

what would two characters like us,

married to other people, be saying?

ALMA

You don't have to pretend you're not

upset he hasn't read it yet, you know.

WHITFIELD COOK

I'm a big boy. I can take it.

ALMA

Well, I loved it. What terrific fun it

must have been to research.

WHITFIELD COOK

Certainly more fun than reading those

reviews.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)

(THEN)

Do you think he really will read it?

WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)

Speak of the devil.

WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)

I have to admit, Hitch, I ran all over

town looking for a copy of "Psycho" but

couldn't find a single one.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I wonder how that could have happened.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Don't stop looking on my behalf.

LEW WASSERMAN

I've seen happier faces on a school bus

going over a cliff.

PEGGY

I told you it would be too much.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

But they can't stop looking, can they?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Audiences want to be shocked, Barney.

They want something different. And this

is it.

BARNEY BALABAN

The truth is, Hitch, every time you want

to do something "different" like The

Wrong Man or Vertigo, someone loses

money.

LEW WASSERMAN

So we should stop trying to give them

something new?

BARNEY BALABAN

You owe Paramount one last picture,

Hitch. Can't you do something like North

by Northwest but for us this time instead

of for MGM?

BARNEY BALABAN (CONT'D)

We've offered you dozens of perfectly

good properties.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

(IMPERIOUSLY)

"Psycho."

BARNEY BALABAN

No one respects the name Hitchcock more

than Paramount. But even a talented man

sometimes backs the wrong horse.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Are you telling me "no?"

BARNEY BALABAN

I think you know me better than that,

Hitch. I would never say "no" to you.

LEW WASSERMAN

What a putz. You know what his family did

before they built those movie palaces?

Ran a grocery store.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

My father ran a grocery store.

LEW WASSERMAN

Exactly. That's what I'm saying. He

should show some respect.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

They think I've lost my touch, Lew.

My association with television has

cheapened me.

LEW WASSERMAN

Are you referring to that deal I got you

where Bristol-Meyers pays you twenty-nine

grand an episode and you own the

negative? That's my kind of cheap.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

They just want the same thing over and

over. They've put me in a coffin and now

they're nailing down the lid.

LEW WASSERMAN

Hitch, I will never let that happen.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)

How much do you think you can make this

picture for?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Eight hundred thousand... Give or take.

LEW WASSERMAN

I have whisky in the car.

ALMA

You're back early.

ALMA (CONT'D)

I'm disappointed you didn't give Whit's

book a chance.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

What about him?

ALMA

He knows you well enough.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Enjoy the pool now. We might not have it

for that much longer.

ALMA

Why?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Paramount refuses to finance the movie.

Imagine -- The studio that brought you

Martin and Lewis and The Greatest Show On

Earth considers Psycho distasteful.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Lew can't find the money. Not quickly

enough at least.

ALMA

Why not wait?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

We're going to have to go it alone, old

girl.

(BEAT)

We'll finance the movie ourselves.

ALMA

Are we going to have to sell the entire

house or just the pool?

ALMA (CONT'D)

Tell me and I won't ever ask again. Why

this one, Hitch? It's not just because so

many people are telling you 'no,' is it?

ALMA (CONT'D)

Hitch?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Remember the fun we had when we started

out and there was so little money and

time? We took risks, we experimented. We

invented new ways of making pictures

because we had to.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

I want to feel that kind of freedom

again.

LEW WASSERMAN (PRE-LAP)

Barney, we're about to propose a

restructured deal for "Psycho"...

LEW WASSERMAN

We finance it. Independently. Paramount

only distributes it...in exchange for 40

percent of the profits.

BARNEY BALABAN

Interesting. But tell us, what exactly is

Paramount distributing? Is this still a

picture about a queer killing people in

his mother's dress?

LEW WASSERMAN

What this picture is about is the

reputation of Alfred Hitchcock.

BARNEY BALABAN

No-one's arguing that.

LEW WASSERMAN

Barney, it's very simple. This is Mr.

Hitchcock's next film. Are you in or are

you out?

BARNEY BALABAN

Well, obviously you have a lot of passion

for this project. Let me talk it over

with a few people internally and I'll get

back to you.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

LEW WASSERMAN

No. Now.

BARNEY BALABAN

Fine. We'll take that deal. If you can

get the money...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

We've already got it, Barney.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Who do I make it out to?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

If this picture fails, Alma, we'll be in

for a long, humiliating bout of crow-

eating.

ALMA

The movie will be splendid.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Are you sure?

ALMA

Of the movie? Not in the least. But of

you? Unquestionably.

JOSEPH STEFANO

Joe Stefano. Good to meet you.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

JOSEPH STEFANO (CONT'D)

Sorry I was late. My shrink session ran

overtime. I see him every day and it's

still not enough.

PEGGY

I thought only director's assistants

needed psychiatrists, not writers.

JOSEPH STEFANO

Do you see a shrink, Mr. Hitchcock?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

No.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

I must say it boggles the mind to imagine

what you and your "shrink" could possibly

talk about daily.

JOSEPH STEFANO

The usual: sex. Rage. My mother.

ACCOUNTANT

There's still the federal income tax

payments... the property taxes... Not to

mention the absence of any salary while

he's actually making the film...

ALMA

Stop waffling, Donald. Give it to me

straight.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ACCOUNTANT

Hitch wasn't exaggerating. If the film's

a flop, you're going to have to sell the

house.

ALMA

Where do you suggest we cut?

ACCOUNTANT

Anywhere you can.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I got Joe Stefano to write out the first

few scenes. Why don't you take a look?

ALMA

We're about to have dinner. You don't

need anything else.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Well?

ALMA

Hire him.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

The only thing worse than a visit to the

dentist is one to the censor.

ALMA

Whatever you do, Alfred, don't lose your

temper.

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK

The Code will absolutely not permit you

to show a knife penetrating a woman's

flesh.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I assure you, Geoffrey, my murders, are

always models of taste and discretion.

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK

Is there any improper suggestion of

nudity in this murder scene in the

shower?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

She won't be nude. She'll be wearing a

shower cap.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK

We might accept a shot from outside the

bathroom window with Marion in silhouette

above the shoulders -- provided the glass

is frosted.

G EOFFREY SHURLOCK

Then -- this scene with the toilet.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

It's completely necessary. Marion flushes

evidence later found by her sister. It's

a clue to the girl's disappearance.

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK

No American movie has ever found it

"necessary" to show a toilet, let alone

to flush it.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in

France and use a bidet instead?

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK

Mr. Hitchcock, if this office denies you

a seal, and we're certainly heading in

that direction, your movie will not be

released in a single theater in this

country. Will you be making jokes then?

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK (CONT'D)

Good. Now why don't we go all the way

back to page two...

ON HITCH

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Everyone in Hollywood resents me. I make

them millions... and yet every year I sit

at those dreadful award show dinners,

waiting for them to say, just once,

"You're good."

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

They take sadistic pleasure in denying me

that one little moment.

ANALYST'S VOICE

That must hurt.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Deeply.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

You'll have to excuse me, doctor. I'm not

used to this... process...

ANALYST'S VOICE

Take your time.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

It's just that, more and more lately,

I've been having these... impulses.

ANALYST'S VOICE

What kind of impulses?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Strong ones.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

DISSOLVES TO :

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Send them all back to Glendale.

PEGGY

The Lazar Office tells me he's crazy to

work with you.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Well, tell "Swifty" he shouldn't have

overexposed his client on television.

ALMA

Unlike certain people we could mention.

ALMA (CONT'D)

Think of the duality he could bring to

Norman. The rage lurking behind that

little-boy-lost grin. The winsome charm

he uses to keep from being found out.

PEGGY

Why, Alma, you're not suggesting that Mr.

Perkins is -- ?

ON HITCHCOCK

ANTHONY PERKINS

I can't count how many times I've seen

Strangers On a Train and Rope.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Well, Norman is the logical extension of

the boys in those movies. Appealing,

sensitive, suffering the terrible burden

of being forced to pretend to be

something he is not.

ANTHONY PERKINS

My only worry is that playing Norman

might cut too close to home.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

How so?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ANTHONY PERKINS

I was incredibly close to my mother. So

close I remember wishing my father would

drop dead. And then when I was five, he

did just that...He keeled over from a

heart attack.

(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

You see I've been guilty my whole life,

Mr. Hitchcock.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Try to remember this is all just make

believe.

ANTHONY PERKINS

Not to be prudish, but how far do you

plan to push Norman's relationship with

his mother?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Further than you can possibly imagine.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I'm getting blisters just looking at you.

ALMA

Stop grumbling. A bit of fresh air and

exercise is exactly what you need.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

If I could get Grace Kelly to play the

girl, they'd let me get away with

anything.

ALMA

Well you can't. She's a princess now

which makes her permanently unattainable.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

And all the more desirable.

ALMA

Lew suggested Deborah Kerr.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Too... Scottish.

ALMA

What about Janet Leigh? She's always the

`good girl' but she did awfully well in

Touch of Evil. Lew mentioned her name. Do

you remember how you always remarked on

her figure at the Wassermans' parties?

MATCH CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Of course the real secret of Mrs.

Simpson's appeal to the Duke of Windsor

was that she could make a toothpick feel

like a cigar.

JANET LEIGH

You know, I've been so immersed in

preparing to play Marion I'd almost

forgotten how to laugh.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Now, you must try the banana shortcake.

JANET LEIGH

Nothing for me, thank you. I'm watching

my figure.

ALMA

You're not the only one.

(to the waiter)

We're fine, thank you.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Bring her the banana shortcake, George.

In fact make it two large portions.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

So do tell me, how else have you've

prepared to play Marion?

JANET LEIGH

I've written a complete history for

her...It seems silly, but it helps me.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

It doesn't sound silly at all. Tell me

one of her deepest secrets.

JANET LEIGH

She leads a double life. For instance,

when she works at the Lowery office, she

wears Tweed perfume. But, when she and

Sam are together, she recklessly breaks

out her one expensive bottle -- "My Sin"

by Lanvin.

JANET LEIGH (CONT'D)

But...I do have a concern or two. I'm an

actress but I'm also a wife and mother

first, so I'm wondering just how you'll

do that shower scene.

ALMA

You and the Shurlock Office.

JANET LEIGH

It's just... I mean even if you shoot me

from here --

(she indicates a spot just

above her bosom)

-- well it's not as if my figure is

boyish.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Allow me to put your mind at rest.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

May I show you some of Mr. Saul Bass's

marvellous story boards?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

I plan to shoot quick bits of film from

various angles.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Cut together, this montage will suggest

nudity and violence but nothing will

actually be shown.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

And having you in the shower will make it

all the more tit-illating --

ALMA

If you'll excuse me.

ALMA

Oh, come off it, old girl.

STUDIO HEAD WIFE

Alma, dear, how lovely to see you.

ALMA

Hello Lillian.

STUDIO HEAD WIFE

You're looking a little pale. No wonder

with that thing your husband's working on

now. You can't possibly approve.

STUDIO HEAD WIFE (CONT'D)

Why are you letting him do something so

tasteless?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALMA

Don't upset yourself, darling. It's only

a bloody movie.

ALMA

I've made a list of places where we can

tighten our belt.

ALMA (CONT'D)

It wouldn't hurt for us all to learn the

art of self restraint.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

The gardeners only once a week and

weekends off for the driver? No.

Absolutely not. We'll find other places

to cut.

ALMA

There aren't any other places. And

furthermore, they'll be no more shipments

from Maxim's either. We can't afford it.

ALMA (CONT'D)

The foie gras at Chasen's is more than

adequate.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

But those geese are from Barstow not

Marseilles.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALMA

We all have to make our little sacrifices

for the greater good, don't we, Alfred?

ED GEIN

Stay here. I'm going to get the knives.

DEAD WOMAN

Help me.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Ed! Ed!

SMASH CUT TO:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Ed... Ed...?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Am I making a mistake?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

What if it's another Vertigo?

ALMA

Oh, shut up. Just get the first take

under your belt you'll be fine.

PEGGY

I still can't believe you cast Vera Miles

as the sister.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I've still got her under contract. I may

as well get something out of it.

PEGGY

Rather a thankless role, don't you think?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

For an utterly thankless girl.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

PEGGY

Shurlock's office called again. They want

to know when you'll be making the changes

to the script.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

The more we frustrate them the more their

interest will wane.

HITCH

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

VERA MILES

Break it to me gently. Am I playing a

lesbian librarian?

RITA RIGGS

(re: the fabric)

He chose it himself and had it imported

from Paris.

VERA MILES

If I wear that, I'm going to look like

George Washington.

RITA RIGGS

Wait until you see the undergarments he

picked out for you.

VERA MILES

I just have to keep telling myself, one

more picture and I'm free as a bird.

VERA MILES (CONT'D)

Is there a fan blowing somewhere?

VERA MILES (CONT'D)

Wow. The old man really is unhappy with

me, isn't he?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Are you decent my dear?

JANET LEIGH

Am I alright?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Perfect.

ANTHONY PERKINS

I want to thank you again for this

opportunity, Mr. Hitchcock.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

It's just "Hitch", Tony. Hold the cock.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Look at you two. America's favorite boy

and girl nextdoor...

JANET LEIGH

And we're about to move to a whole new

neighborhood.

VERA MILES

Morning Janet. Morning Tony.

VERA MILES (CONT'D)

"Thanks" for the wardrobe, Hitch.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

(already moving past her)

That's hand-woven imported camel hair

from Rodier. Don't you approve?

VERA MILES

You're the genius.

VERA MILES (CONT'D)

One thing, though. My script is missing

the last ten pages.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Everyone's is. Until Alma finishes the

revisions. Now hurry along, Vera. You're

just in time for the oath.

VERA MILES

The what?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I solemnly promise...

CREW

I solemnly promise...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

(ignoring Vera's sarcasm)

That I will not divulge the plot nor the

many secrets of Psycho...

CREW

That I will not divulge the plot nor the

many secrets of Psycho...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

To friends, relatives, trade reporters or

columnists -- not even to outgoing

President Dwight D. Eisenhower, God bless

him.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ANTHONY PERKINS

Now, Hitch, explain to me why I'm

watching Marion undress?

JANET LEIGH

I feel like I should take offense at

that.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I don't know...Perhaps as a boy, Norman

secretly watched his mother preparing for

her nightly bath.

JANET LEIGH

Maybe there was a transom over the

bathroom door?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Yes -- one he could access with a chair

so long as he was stealthy.

JANET LEIGH

Well, a boy's first glimpse of a naked

woman is usually his mother.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ANTHONY PERKINS

So...I'm reliving the past, repeating a

ritual with Marion?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

You're the actor. You figure it out.

JANET LEIGH

Hitch, I have a question. Why is the hole

much larger on this side?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

All the better to see you at the greatest

possible angle my dear...

JANET LEIGH

Wow. You really do your research, don't

you?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

It's just my Jesuit work ethic.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)

The truth is... I'm only happy when I'm

working...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

... and if I'm not working then I'm

nothing. I'm not even a person. I'm just

a collection of molecules. A useless

cylinder of ugly flesh.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ANALYST'S VOICE (O.S.)

What about your mother? Let's go back to

her.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

My mother? Yes.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

She was an extraordinary person. She

exposed me to Ibsen, Strindberg, Shaw.

She hoped I would go into engineering --

carry a lunch pail, gold watch at fifty.

ANALYST'S VOICE (O.S.)

She didn't approve of your career?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

To her, movie people were akin to thieves

and prostitutes.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

If I misbehaved, she'd make me stand at

the foot of her bed and discuss how I

planned to become a better boy.

ANALYST'S VOICE (O.S.)

Have you ever considered that your deep

desire to gain the approval of your

industry represents a textbook case of

transference?

(THEN)

The Oscar is your mother.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

You're a fine one to talk.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

You will be wearing a white bra like this

for the opening scene on the bed. And

then after you've stolen the money...

JANET LEIGH

I switch to one of these.

RITA RIGGS

Are you sure you don't want to look at

something a little more elegant?

HITCHCOCK

(SHARP)

No. They have to look like they were

bought at Sears and Roebuck. I want every

woman in the audience to look up at Janet

having sex with John Gavin and think,

`that could be me'.

JANET

This is the brand I wear.

HITCHCOCK

We're ready for a fitting.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O. PRE-LAP)

We travel across the rooftops of downtown

Phoenix and finally, through the heat,

pick out a certain hotel window...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

We go under the blinds and match dissolve

into the room itself...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.)

We pan over and discover John and Janet

on the bed.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

She'll be wearing only her undergarments

and a large glow of satisfaction...

ON HITCH

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Cut.

PEGGY

Good luck getting this one past the

censor.

WHITFIELD COOK

You girls go on ahead.

PEGGY

If you ask me, the credits should read

"Screenplay by Joseph Stefano and Alma

Reville."

ALMA

The people who matter know. That's all

that counts.

PEGGY

I'd hate to see Shurlock's face when he

reads this.

PEGGY (CONT'D)

Alma, you always know the answer. Is this

really going to work?

WHITFIELD COOK

Hello, stranger.

ALMA

Whit.

WHITFIELD COOK

Where have you been hiding yourself?

ALMA

I've been doing the revisions on...

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

WHITFIELD COOK

Psycho.

(THEN)

And how is the old boy?

ALMA

In a state of unbridled ecstacy now that

he's back on the set.

WHITFIELD COOK

And you? How are you?

ALMA

Not bad. I've got eight hundred words to

do for Reader's Digest on what it's like

to be married to a man obsessed by

murder.

WHITFIELD COOK

I've got a better idea.

WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)

Why don't we drive out to Santa Barbara?

We'll have Emilio fry up those juicy

steaks we like at El Encanto.

WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)

No shoptalk ... No silly magazine

articles...just a wonderful meal...

A.D. HILTON GREEN

We're ready for you on the set, Mr.

Hitchcock.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I'll be right there.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

A.D. HILTON GREEN

Mr. Hitchcock?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Was there a line at the market?

ALMA

No. Actually, I'm back sooner than I

expected.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Would you like a cocktail?

ALMA

No.

(he starts to head off)

And you shouldn't either.

ALMA (CONT'D)

Those haven't been washed yet.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

(CHEWING)

I don't care.

(THEN)

I was filming all day with John Gavin --

a good-looking chap but, really, plywood

is more expressive. His love scene with

Janet may be most horrifying thing in the

picture.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Even your friend Whitfield Cook would be

better in the scene.

ALMA

You should tell Whit that. He'd be

flattered.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Maybe I was too dismissive about your

friend Whitfield's book. Perhaps he and

Elizabeth could come over this weekend

and he can walk me through it.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Lovely woman, Elizabeth...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

I was hoping you could come by the set

tomorrow.

ALMA

I'll see how my day shapes up.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (PRE-LAP)

You think you can get away with it but

you can't...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

... You think they can't tell... but they

can. They know. It's all closing in on

you. The noose is tightening...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

You could return the money secretly, but

what would be the point?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

You, Marion Crane. The prim and proper

girl who's always been so tight and

respectable. So perfect and untouchable.

Well, they know all about your dirty

little secret, don't they? Your messy,

sticky lunchtime trysts. Yes, your boss

Mr. Lowery could even smell the sex on

YOU--

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Circle that.

VERA MILES

Have you talked to him much about your

personal life?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

JANET LEIGH

Not really...

VERA MILES

I'd keep it that way if I were you.

(Off Janet's look)

He starts by choosing your hairstyle and

clothes and then he wants to choose your

friends and decide how many children you

should have.

VERA MILES (CONT'D)

That poor, tortured soul Jimmy Stewart

played in Vertigo? That's Hitch, only

younger, slimmer and better-looking.

JANET LEIGH

Compared to Orson Welles, he's a

sweetheart.

VERA MILES

(WHISPERS)

See? He's always watching.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

What's the hold up?

PEGGY

It's still engaged.

VERA MILES

Hitch, I'm stuck on Lila's first scene. I

don't know how strongly I should confront

Sam and the detective and I --

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

(ACIDLY)

Fake it.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Does it really require two men to carry a

light stand?

A.D. HILTON GREEN

I'll take care of it right away, Mr.

Hitchcock.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

It's different when their pay is coming

out of your own pocket.

WHITFIELD COOK (ON PHONE)

Well, I think that sounds like a fabulous

idea. We'll have a late lunch. I'll make

the reservation for one thirty.

ALMA

What would I do without you?

WHITFIELD COOK

Till then, bye.

ALMA

(LAUGHING)

What did you forget now?

ALMA (ON PHONE)

Whit? Is that you?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

PR FLACK

Mr. Hitchcock, every press outlet is

driving us crazy for photos --

PEGGY

Are you okay? You've gone very pale.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Stop trailing me like a puppy dog and get

me something long, cool and wet.

PEGGY

It's not even three.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Give me the key!

BARNEY BALABAN

Hello, Hitch. How's the picture? I'm

hearing interesting things...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

It's a wonder you can hear anything over

the noise coming from the Shurlock

office.

BARNEY BALABAN

I shouldn't be in a position of just

hearing things, Hitch. It's time you

showed me some footage.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Why?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

BARNEY BALABAN

To see if you're making a picture

Paramount can actually release.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

As you well know, Barney, my contract

guarantees me final cut.

BARNEY BALABAN

Your contract also says Paramount isn't

required to distribute any film that

could cause us embarrassment.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Unlike the last five Martin and Lewis

pictures you're all so proud of.

BARNEY BALABAN (O.S.)

I demand to see some footage, Hitch.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Connect me to Maxim's of Paris.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

(ON PHONE)

Yes, it's Alfred Hitchcock in Hollywood,

California, Jean-Claude. I need three

pounds of foie gras sent on the next

flight out.

(THEN)

That's correct. Three.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

WHITFIELD COOK

Those steaks haven't changed at all, have

they?

ALMA

It's so nice not to have to take care of

someone, even if it's just for an hour or

two.

ALMA (CONT'D)

Whit, where are we going? You still

haven't told me.

WHITFIELD COOK

I have a little surprise.

ALMA

A surprise. How fun.

JANET LEIGH

What happened to your driver?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I've been asking myself the same thing.

JANET LEIGH

I can give you a ride if you want.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Did you know Adolf Hitler sketched the

design for this car on Ferdinand

Porsche's cocktail napkin in a Berlin

beer garden?

JANET LEIGH

I didn't.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

It's only now that I truly appreciate

just how diabolical Herr Hitler was.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

May I?

JANET LEIGH

Help yourself.

(letting him in on it)

I pinched them from Tony's dressing room.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

So this is what they eat at the drive-

ins...

JANET LEIGH

I thought you only ate Fauchon chocolate.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Needs must when the devil drives, my

dear.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALMA

I don't mind that he uses his obsession

to fuel his art. I just don't like it

when he uses it against me.

WHITFIELD COOK

He's like any great artist. Impossible to

live with but worth the effort.

(he throws a rock into the

SEA)

Van Gogh wasn't exactly a walk in the

park either.

ALMA

Did you know when we started out I was

his boss? He didn't even dare ask me out

until he'd worked his way up to assistant

director.

WHITFIELD COOK

What do you think of that place over

there?

ALMA

Looks nice. Terrific location. Why?

WHITFIELD COOK

It's mine.

ALMA

I just saw Elizabeth. Why on earth didn't

she tell me?

WHITFIELD COOK

She doesn't know about it.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

JANET LEIGH

So what did happen between you and Vera?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I was going to make her star. But she

chose the life of a housewife.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

I cast her as the lead in Vertigo. Then

two weeks before filming she told me was

pregnant.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Why do they do it? Why do they always

betray me?

ON JANET

WHITFIELD COOK

I'm just leasing it for the offseason. A

place to get away from the wife and kid

and write.

ALMA

Very Bohemian.

WHITFIELD COOK

You might find that room interesting.

ALMA

Whit. I hope you haven't got the wrong

idea.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

WHITFIELD COOK

If you were serious about helping me

adapt my book, I thought it would be the

perfect hideaway.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

So I read your finished treatment. "Taxi

to -- " Where was it?

ALMA

Dubrovnik.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

That's it. Dubrovnik. Care to hear my

opinion?

ALMA

Yes. Naturally.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

There's no other way of saying it. It's

stillborn. Dead in the water.

ALMA

How so?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

(with mock compassion)

The plot's a muddle. Some of the jokes

are awfully like things we already did

better hundreds of years ago in The Lady

Vanishes. And your villain is weak. But

the biggest failure is the relationship

between the hero and heroine.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

If you weren't so smitten with your

friend Whitfield cook you'd probably see

that.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Women never really care to face the truth

when their hearts are involved, do they?

ALMA

How would you know what really goes on

between a man and a woman?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Look at this mess.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Bloody belt-tightening.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALMA

HITCH

SET HAND

Tell the boss we're ready.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

What's the hold-up? Call time was two

hours ago.

JANET LEIGH

And you're sure this moleskin will stay

put?

RITA RIGGS

Mr. Hitchcock promised.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

JANET LEIGH

It better. I'm going to be taking a

shower all week.

ALMA

Forget what Hitch said. He's just feeling

his age. He'll come around.

WHITFIELD COOK

But he's right. It does need more

feeling.

ALMA

So why don't we put some in?

ALMA (CONT'D)

All we need is a better catalyst. Some

innocuous little trigger to release all

that underlying desire.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Good morning.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

As I explained earlier, this scene will

be made up of many shots from Mr. Bass's

boards. A series of looks - actions...

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Well, you're the professional. You'll

know how to do it.

FIRST A.D. HILTON GREEN

Tony's stunt double is ready.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Ah. There's our murderess.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

(TO JANET)

Are you ready for our little bloodbath?

JANET LEIGH

My mother always said, "Have confidence

in yourself and you can lick anything."

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

My mother used to say the same thing.

(THEN)

Let's go for a take. Quiet everyone.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Cut. More intensely. Let's go again.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

No. More angry. You are possessed with

unbridled homicidal rage.

(LEAPING UP)

Cut. Cut camera.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Does no one understand what I'm trying to

accomplish here? I'm older than anyone on

this stage and I'm still standing.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Give me the knife.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Props. Bring in more blood.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Roll camera.

CREW MEMBER

Ready, sir.

ON HITCH

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Not now, Ed. It's really not a good time.

ED GEIN

You just can't keep this stuff bottled

up.

PEGGY

Oh God...

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

A TELEPHONE

WHITFIELD COOK

What if Helen and Michael try and get

into the cab at the same time?

ALMA

Even better, what if they reached for the

cab door at exactly the same time?

ALMA (CONT'D)

That way, we could start close on the

hands...

(tracking the movement)

... and then tilt up to the eyes.

WHITFIELD COOK

That feels better already.

ALMA

Are you going to get that?

WHITFIELD COOK (O.S.)

Hullo?... Yes... Hold on.

WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)

It's for you.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

PEGGY

I know you told me only to call in an

emergency, but I'm not sure how else to

describe this.

FADE TO BLACK.

MARTIN BALSAM

It's official. The inmates are running

the asylum.

PEGGY

Hilton. I have Mr. Hitchcock for you.

HILTON GREEN

Hey there, Hitch. We're still working on

it.

(looking over at the

CONTINUING ARGUMENT)

Everyone misses you.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I've told Peggy and now I'm going to tell

you. You have to get this sequence shot

today. What's the hold up?

HILTON GREEN

We tried it ten different ways and it

looks terrible. Why don't we use inserts?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

No. It has to be a high angle. You'll tip

off the big surprise! Just get the

process shot.

ON HILTON

ALMA

No more phone calls. You're burning up.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Burning up our money. We're two days

behind and I'm stuck in bed.

ALMA

Where do you think you're going?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

To the set. We can't afford to lose any

more time. Two more days of this and the

whole production goes under.

ALMA

You stay in bed. I'll deal with it.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I'd hate to take you away from your

writing partner.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALMA

Under the blankets. Now.

ALMA

Don't stop work because of me. I'm only

here as one of the two people paying your

salaries.

ALMA (CONT'D)

Scene?

PEGGY

One seventy three.

ALMA

Storyboards?

ALMA (CONT'D)

Start with the overhead. We'll cut before

the fall. Then we'll put Martin in a

chair under the camera.

ALMA (CONT'D)

(to the cameraman)

And that lens should be a thirty-five.

ED GEIN (O.S.)

You forgot to look in the bathroom.

ED GEIN (CONT'D)

A man like you... Missing the vital clue

like that...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

What do you mean?

ED GEIN

My mother always said if you're going to

do a job, do it right.

ED GEIN

Check the floor.

ED GEIN (CONT'D)

Closer.

COLLECT --

ED GEIN (CONT'D)

You still think they're just writing

together?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ED GEIN (CONT'D)

So what are you going to do about it?

OMITTED

ALMA

Barney.

BARNEY BALABAN

Alma.

BARNEY

You know David Kirkpatrick. He's working

on Jerry Lewis' next picture.

BARNEY (CONT'D)

So he's free to help...

(a sly smile)

if you need it...

ALMA

That won't be necessary.

BARNEY

But you're nearly three days behind.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

BARNEY BALABAN

Alma. We both know what kind of film this

is.

(then, closer)

The smart thing to do would be to help

Hitch finish it.

ALMA

Thank you for your concern, Barney.

ALMA (CONT'D)

But on a Hitchcock picture, there is only

one director.

WOMAN'S VOICE

Mrs. Hitchcock?

JANET

I hope you don't mind. I heard Hitch was

sick so I got him a little something.

ALMA

That's kind of you.

JANET

Well, he's been very considerate with me.

(A BEAT)

I haven't always had that from my

directors.

ALMA

Janet, you've been very... professional.

It hasn't gone unappreciated.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALMA

May I turn that down?

ALMA (CONT'D)

You'll be pleased to know order has been

restored.

ALMA (CONT'D)

A thank you would be nice.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

We're still two days behind and sixty

thousand over budget.

ALMA

I already cancelled the wrap party.

That'll save us two thousand right there.

And you won't be tempted by any champagne

and cake.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Beware -- all men are potential

murderers.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

With good reason.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALMA

Alright, what's this about?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Spending a lot of time at the beach?

ALMA

That's where Whit and I are writing. He's

rented a place.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Hardly the ideal setting to avoid

distractions.

ALMA

Actually, it's very conducive to creative

collaboration.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I already told you -- that treatment is a

waste of time.

ALMA

Didn't everyone say the same thing about

"Psycho"?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Are you and Whit having an affair?

ALMA

Don't be absurd. He's working on

something new and needs a little help,

that's all.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

What a coincidence. I'm working on

something new and I could use a little

help too.

ALMA

What do you think I've been doing?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Then why are you spending all hours of

the day and night with some overage,

talentless mamma's boy?

ALMA

Because it's fun.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I am under extraordinary pressures on

this picture, the least you can do is

give me your full support.

ALMA

Full support? We've mortgaged our house.

My house.

ALMA (CONT'D)

Might I remind you that I have weighed-in

on every aspect of this film so far, as I

have done on every picture you've done in

the last three decades. And the first

time you show the film, it will be my

notes that you want. I celebrate with you

if the reviews are good and I cry for you

if they are not. I host your parties and

put up with those fantasy romances with

your leading ladies. And when you're out

promoting this film around the world, I

will stand beside or, rather, slightly

behind you, smiling endlessly for the

press even when I'm ready to drop, being

gracious to people who look through me as

if I were invisible because all they can

see is the grand and glorious "Alfred

Hitchcock."

ALMA (CONT'D)

Now, for the first time in years, I dare

to work on something that isn't "an

Alfred Hitchcock Production" and I'm met

with accusation and criticisms. This work

I'm doing with Whit gives me pleasure and

purpose.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)

ALMA (CONT'D)

And even though that takes absolutely

nothing away from you, please consider

this a reminder: I am your wife, Alma

Reville, not one of the contract blondes

you badger and torment with your oh-so-

specific direction.

Hello Hitch.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Well, Vera. You always make it look so

easy.

VERA MILES

Oh, it was nothing, Hitch. I just faked

it.

VERA MILES (CONT'D)

Well, I guess this is au revoir...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Why didn't you stay with me? I would have

made you as big a star as Grace Kelly.

VERA MILES

Unlike Grace Kelly, I can pick up my dry

cleaning. I've got a family, Hitch. A

home. That will always mean more to me

than all of this.

(THEN)

That blonde woman of mystery you're

after? She's a fantasy. She doesn't

exist.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

There was a time when I thought I

understood you so completely --

understood women....

ALMA'S CAR

WHITFIELD COOK

Alma, I thought you were coming later

tonight.

ALMA

I thought you rented this place so we

could write.

WHITFIELD COOK

I did. I swear -- this just happened.

WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)

You won't say anything, will you?

ALMA

Don't worry. I won't tell Elizabeth.

WHITFIELD COOK

I mean to Hitch.

WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)

We can't all be geniuses.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)

Alma -- you're incredibly talented. But,

after all... we want him to read the

script with an open mind.

ALMA

Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, Whit.

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK

You're going to have to cut all that

nudity.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

What nudity? It was suggested.

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK

I definitely saw that knife jabbing her.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

We did no such shot.

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK

I'd stake my reputation on it. I'm

recommending you cut the shower scene

entirely.

(CONTINUED)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I'll go over it frame by frame and set up

another screening.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

What's the verdict?

LEW WASSERMAN

Let's just say it was a four-letter

review and it wasn't `good'.

LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)

Screw him. It's too late for Paramount to

back out no matter what Balaban says.

LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)

The other route is to recut it as a two-

parter for the TV series. Because of the

budget and the Hitchcock name, we stand a

good chance of breaking even.

LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)

Look, I made Jimmy Stewart a millionaire

of Winchester 73 and that was a dog. At

least I could sit through your picture.

LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)

More importantly, what does Alma think?

ALMA

Is there anything else we can do?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ACCOUNTANT

We'll just have to wait and see how the

movie turns out.

ALMA

Well, it is only a house.

HITCH

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ED GEIN

This is my favorite place. I just shut

the doors and leave the world behind.

ED GEIN (CONT'D)

Pass me that bag, will you?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Don't you get lonely out here sometimes?

ED GEIN

I can always talk to my mother.

DOOR --

ED GEIN (CONT'D)

That's strange.

CAPTAIN SCHOEPHOERSTER (O.S.)

Jesus Christ.

CAPTAIN SCHOEPHOERSTER (CONT'D)

I think we found his hiding spot.

ED GEIN

(SOTTO VOCE)

They can't go in there. That's my

mother's room...

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

ED GEIN (CONT'D)

They can't go in there!

(CALLING OUT)

That's my mother's room!!

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

An odd little movie. Of course, Colbert

is wonderful.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

How was the beach?

ALMA

Cold and miserable.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Just like Barney Balaban's face.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Whit isn't worth a damn when he's not

working with you.

(PAUSE)

And neither am I.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

I didn't pull off the picture this time.

It just sits there, refusing to come to

life.

(THEN)

There's no other way to say it... It's

stillborn.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

I let you down, my love.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

You deserved better.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

I'll go and feed Geoffrey and Stanley,

shall I.

ALMA

I don't think I can stand both of us

being maudlin.

ALMA (CONT'D)

There is one solution to all this, you

know.

ALMA (CONT'D)

We could both get to work -- together.

ALMA (CONT'D)

That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation

I've been helping Whit finish is done.

ALMA (CONT'D)

So I suggest, for everyone's sake, we

start whipping Psycho into shape

tomorrow. You may not be the easiest man

to live with but you know how to cut a

picture better than anyone.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Except for you.

ALMA

You'll need to cut those six or seven

frames where she blinks after she's

supposed to be dead.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

We've seen the footage a thousand times.

She doesn't blink.

ALMA

(FIRST MOVIOLA)

Take thirty frames off the head...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

No, no, the second take, the light is

better on his hands.

ALMA

(NEXT MOVIOLA)

Only cut back to Janet once the car's

already moving.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Cut it tighter. The minute I lose one

person I've lost the whole audience.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALMA

You imp. You got nudity in there.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Her breasts are very large, dear. It was

a challenge not to show them.

GEORGE TOMASINI

I'll be damned. She did blink.

FLACK

How's it going in there with Mr.

Herrmann?

PEGGY

Swimmingly.

FLACK

Everyone's saying it's a dog with fleas.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (O.S.)

Absolutely not...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

...I don't want music in the shower

murder.

BERNARD HERRMANN

(FRUSTRATED)

But what Alma and I talked about is

really going to play.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

No. This isn't Vertigo, Bernie. This is

different. The images have to work on

their own.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALMA

You can't scare people just by going,

"Boo!" You have to tell them what's

coming, make them anticipate it --

OUTSIDE

FLACK

Thank God we've got Cinderfella for the

holidays.

OMITTED

GEORGE TOMASINI

What do you think?

PEGGY

I think I'm never going to take a shower

again.

GEORGE TOMASINI

Hitch?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

It's getting there.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK

I told you, I distinctly saw both the

stabbing and the nudity. We're denying

your seal, Mr. Hitchcock.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I take your opinion very seriously. But

what you think you're seeing is purely

informed by the power of suggestion. I

assure you that once you view the final

version with Mr. Herrmann's lovely,

lyrical score...

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK

A "lyrical score" won't change my

opinion. All that innuendo and half-naked

groping -- really, Hitch.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Would you mind if we had a word in

private, Geoffrey?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

I have a modest proposal to make. If

you're willing to leave the shower

sequence as it is, I will reshoot the

opening love scene to your exact

specifications.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

In fact, I'd welcome your personal

supervision on the set.

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK

My specifications?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

If only audiences could fully appreciate

how tirelessly you work to help us

entertain them while protecting them from

filth and indecency.

PEGGY

He's been harassing you since you

announced this project, you invite him to

the set, and he doesn't even show up?

What did you tell him?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

That I respected him. Deeply.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Ladies and gentleman, that is a wrap.

Thank you all.

JANET LEIGH

I thought we were reshooting the scene.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

No need. The charade is over.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

See, I wasn't that much of a monster to

work with, was I?

JANET LEIGH

Not at all.

JANET LEIGH (CONT'D)

I just hope I was sufficiently loyal to

the cause.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Worthy of a Purple Heart, my dear.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I hope you don't mind, I told Mrs. Bates

she could have your dressing room.

ON JANET

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

We have our seal from Shurlock's office.

(DEVILISHLY)

Now, we lead the lambs to the slaughter.

LEW WASSERMAN

The front office confirmed. They're only

opening the movie in two theatres, as we

suspected. And no premiere. If we don't

get word of mouth we're dead.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Then we'd better get started. Peggy, take

a memo...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

We're going to write a manual on exactly

how to sell Psycho.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.)

My first instruction to Theater Owners:

Hire Pinkerton guards to strictly enforce

our unique admission policies.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.)

Furthermore, because Psycho is so

terrifying and unique, the guards can

help you deal with customers who run

amok.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.)

Post our special lobby clocks to remind

audiences of the starting times for

Psycho.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.)

The manager of this fine motion picture

theater has been advised not to allow

anyone to enter the theater once Psycho

begins.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Should you be so foolish as to attempt to

slip in by a side entrance...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

... a fire escape or through a skylight,

you will be ejected by brute force.

ALMA

More playful, darling.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.)

"To further emphasize the sheer,

unrelenting shock and suspense of Psycho,

right after the closing title "THE END,"

we strongly recommend that you close your

house curtains over the screen for a full

thirty seconds."

ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S VOICE

"By doing so, the horror of Psycho will

be indelibly etched in the mind and heart

of your audience."

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

BARNEY BALABAN

"Absolutely never, ever will I allow

anything to follow Psycho -- no previews

of coming attractions, no newsreel, no

short subject and certainly no double-

feature. Sincerely, and, emphatically,

Alfred Hitchcock."

BARNEY BALABAN (CONT'D)

At the end of the day, it's a minor

Hitchcock movie. One week, and it'll be

gone...

BARNEY BALABAN (CONT'D)

Like a bad dream.

138 OMITTED

ALMA

Well, at least there are some people

here.

PEGGY

PEGGY

We can go through the side entrance.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

THEATER MANAGER

Right this way, Mr. and Mrs. Hitchcock.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Ready for the gallows?

LEW WASSERMAN

We've roped off some seats for you.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

You go on ahead.

ALMA

Are you sure?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I'll join you in a minute.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

I want to double check the print.

ALMA

Fine, darling. I'll save you a seat.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

(under his breath)

But they're laughing too much.

HITCH

HITCH

(CONTINUED)

WOMAN WAITING ON LINE

Mr. Hitchcock, how does it end?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

I promised Mother I wouldn't tell.

THEATER MANAGER

Mr. Hitchcock, what do I do now that my

wife won't take a shower after seeing

your movie?

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Have her dry-cleaned.

LEW WASSERMAN

I just got off the phone with Balaban. I

couldn't resist telling him we're sold

out for the next two weeks.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

What did he say?

LEW WASSERMAN

He said "Tell Hitch congratulations. A

well deserved triumph as we always knew."

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

"As we always knew..."

PEGGY

Does this mean I can take the weekend off

now?

THEATRE MANAGER

I'm sorry, Mr. Hithcock but there are

photographers outside. They heard you

were here.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

ALMA

This could be the biggest hit of your

career, Alfred.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Our career, Alma.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

I've realized I'll never be able to find

a Hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you.

ALMA

You do realize I've been waiting decades

to hear you say that.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

And that, madame, is why they call me

"The Master of Suspense"...

ORDERLY

(to the Attendant)

Guess what I'm doing this weekend?

ATTENDANT

What?

ORDERLY

Claudine and I are driving to Chicago

with her folks to see that Psycho movie.

CHET

I think you're the happiest guy I've ever

known, Ed. How you do it?

ED GEIN

I'll tell you. You live your life, and

it's unbearable sometimes but there's

this secret, Chet; a big secret no one

else knows or wants to tell...

(he leans a little closer)

... there is a God and he's so big and

powerful, he doesn't always remember

you're there...

ED GEIN (CONT'D)

... but if you can get his attention and

he sees you're suffering, he'll notice

and he'll take care of you. My mother

used to tell me -- she's passed, God

bless her -- the one thing God truly

loves and understands is suffering.

ED GEIN (CONT'D)

After all, he invented it.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

And so, gentle viewer, Psycho -- the

picture everyone predicted would bring me

to wrack and ruin -- was such a hit that

Alma and I got to... Well, let's just say

that we got to keep our house -- and the

swimming pool. And the same critics who

despised it went on to call it one of my

greatest achievements.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Of course for me, it was just another

"moo-vie."

ALFRED HITCHCOCK

But you know what they say in Hollywood:

"You're only as good as your last

picture." So, now, if you'll excuse me, I

must toddle off to begin the exhaustive

search for my next project.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Unfortunately I find myself once again

bereft of all inspiration. I do hope

something comes along soon...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

Good evening.
