1   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   1

Dark clouds passing overhead.

The bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains, (in

Germany), the past three days is on it's way out..

2   AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY                    2

A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares.

Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..

3   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   3

The first rays of sunshine break through. The voices of

international TV commentators in different languages.

COMMENTATORS

...in places the track is still

dangerously wet, but following a

drivers meeting the decision has been

taken. The race is going ahead...

4   INT. FERRARI - DAY                                                4

The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER

wearing a fireproof balaclava...

Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His

name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA.

NIKI (V/O)

My grandfather always said history is

cruel and reductive and no matter how

long we live, or how much we achieve -

we are remembered for very little. So

make sure it's the right things.

NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking.

Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision...

Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be

using slicks or wets?

5   EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                          5

We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major

Grand Prix. All around us...

(CONTINUED)

5   CONTINUED:                                                       5

Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An

OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One

Minute"...

Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.

NIKI

This is bullshit. We have no control

over our legacy. We cannot choose what

we are remembered for...

A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian

above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...

MECHANIC

Mass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare

anche tu?

(Mass is going on slicks. You

want to change?)

NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white

helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of

MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.

NIKI

Otherwise I wouldn't be remembered for

my rivalry with this asshole. And the

1976 season.

NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him.

Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...

NIKI

What about Hunt? Has he changed?

MECHANIC

No, he's going on wets.

The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews,

mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on..

The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but

HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1.

NIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's

glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava,

flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..

NIKI

I don't know why it became such a big

thing. We were just drivers. Busting

each other's balls. To me this is

perfectly normal. But other people saw

it differently.

NIKI (contid)

That whatever it was between us went

deeper. And changed us both somehow.

Forever.

NIKI stares, then...

NIKI

Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da

bagnato.

(Then we go on wets, too.)

The ten-second board is held up.

NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a

split-second, eyes staring...

NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the

engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000

RPM.

NIKI

Maybe that explains the state of mind

I was in. And why it happened. The

other thing I'm remembered for.

(a beat)

On August 1st, that same year...

CAPTION: "AUGUST 1st, 1976".

The STARTER waves the flag. NIKI's foot hits the floor - his

engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high-pitch

scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd.

NIKI's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin

leaving livid black scars on the asphalt..

NIKI gets away first. A good start! But within seconds there's

a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck.

His arch-rival. HUNT.

But as the McLaren roars past, NIKI sees a white helmet.

Number 12. It's not Hunt. It's MASS. On his bald, slick tyres.

NIKI curses under his breath. He screwed up. Made the wrong

decision. Should have gone on slicks. He urgently needs to

change tyres...

NIKI swerves angrily into the pits. Ferrari's pit is right at

one end...

4

6   INT. PITS - DAY                                                   6

Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the

crazy, panicked situation as all the DRIVERS come into the

pits to change to dry tyres.

It's chaos. A traffic jam of Formula 1 cars...

The Ferrari team frantically work. Changing NIKI's tyres. Four

men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks. The same

Italian MECHANIC appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car..

MECHANIC

Hair visto? Ti aveto detto di usare le

slicks!

(See? I told you to go on

slicks!!)

NIKI

Bullshit. Where's Hunt?

MECHANIC

There!

NIKI looks up to see the name JAMES HUNT written on the black

helmet roar out of the pits ahead, with new tyres on...

NIKI

C'mon...!!

NIKI screams at the MECHANICS, who are struggling. The airguns

make a high-pitched noise...something's not right.

NIKI

What's GOING ON???

"Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and

NIKI exit the pits in pursuit of HUNT. But the delay has cost

him dear...

7   EXT. NUBURGRING - DAY                                             7

Archive TV commentary from the world's race COMMENTATORS

stations informs us of the positions.

MASS leading, HUNT in 3rd, LAUDA in 20th...

8   INT. NIKI'S CAR - DAY                                             8

NIKI gives it everything he's got. Tearing through the gears,

trying to catch JAMES HUNT, breaking as late as he can, engine

screaming.

(CONTINUED)

8   CONTINUED:                                                       8

He flies over the take-off hump between Pflanzgarten and

Swallowtail - passes one car after another. Into 13th place

now. Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres.

NIKI's P.O.V: the world flies past in a blur. The steering

wheel shakes. The car is right on the edge. Cannot be driven

any harder.

NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of

the course...turns left at the Bergwerk corner. Crazy speed.

And tight. Too tight. A mistake...

"Thump", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the

inside. NIKI tries to counter-steer, but is travelling at 155

mph. The car jerks horribly to the right..

"Crunch", hits the embankment, then "Bang", hits the barrier,

and is thrown across the track..

Fire breaks out in the engine. NIKI's eyes widen in horror,

with another car bearing down upon him...

NIKI

No...!

The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car, "Crash", a

sickening, terrifying impact.

The car explodes. Seventy litres of burning high-octane

gasoline, with NIKI strapped inside, unable to undo his

seatbelt. Locked in a blast furnace.

NIKI screams as the flames engulf him. 800 degrees

temperature. Trapped inside his car.

Burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs...

Pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked TV

commentators helplessly describe what's happening..

NIKI's POV: he can just make out the barely recognizable

figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards NIKI..

Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully

to undo NIKI's seatbelt..

Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Dry powder extinguishers.

Covering NIKI's helmet. Blurring his vision, as he cries out

in agony, inhaling the powder..

Screaming voices. Panicked reactions. On the side of the car,

the painted name `Niki Lauda' blisters and melts.

8   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   8

Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.

FADE TO BLACK:

Over this: the sound of a ringing phone...

9   INT. HOSPITAL A&E UNIT - (ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY) - DAY           9

We're in a busy hospital A&E unit. Noise. Crowds. A regular

Saturday late afternoon. The phone continues to ring..

Finally, an attractive station NURSE in her 20's, run-off-her-

feet, breathlessly picks up the phone.

NURSE

Emergency...

She covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is

being said. Then her expression changes...

NURSE

Okay...standing by!

The NURSE hangs up...then calls out to her NURSE and DOCTOR

colleagues...

NURSE

That was the race-track..! There's

been an accident..! A driver's been

injured and is on his way in..!

Instantly the atmosphere changes. A hive of activity as

DOCTORS and NURSES prepare themselves for a major trauma...

All PATIENTS with minor injuries are cleared out of the way.

The NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and

consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by...

CAPTION: "EIGHTY-EIGHT RACES EARLIER"

Swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, BARE FEET walks

through and into the accident and emergency unit.

Camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing

overalls...to reveal a tall, good-looking driver, JAMES HUNT,

(mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair...

A man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to

describe an Englishman. SEXY.

Blood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and

the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no

mistake. He rocks. Drop-dead gorgeous..

JAMES

I think the racetrack telephoned ahead

that I was coming? Hunt? James Hunt..?

JAMES notices all the NURSES staring..

JAMES

What's the matter? No one seen a spot

of blood before?

NURSE

Are you all right?

JAMES

Absolutely fine.

10   INT. A&E UNIT - DAY                                              10

The attractive NURSE is examining JAMES, opening his overalls,

checking for wounds, cuts and bruises...

NURSE

We all thought you'd been in an

accident.

JAMES

I have. If you call a friendly

disagreement with another driver an

accident.

NURSE

What did you disagree about?

JAMES

None of your business. Ouch.

NURSE

Sorry.

JAMES

His wife.

NURSE

That's going to need a couple of

stitches. It's a nasty cut.

JAMES

It was a nasty blow. Done with a

bloody spanner.

NURSE

Why? What did you do?

(CONTINUED)

10   CONTINUED:                                                      10

JAMES

Nothing! Only what she begged me to

do.

The NURSE notices bruising on JAMES's chest...

NURSE

Which was..?

She examines him, testing his ribs for fractures, his chest..

JAMES looks up. Their eyes meet..

JAMES

Be happy to show you if you like.

11   INT. JAMES'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  11

`Crash', the door flies open as JAMES and the NURSE stumble

through, mid-embrace, tearing at one another's clothes...

The apartment is basic. Cramped. Messy. Like that of a poor

student. Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints. Empty beer

cans. A toaster. A kettle. A stereo. A cage containing two

budgerigars.

A mattress on the floor.

Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike, England's

crumbling economy, Rolls Royce being bailed out by the

government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition,

leaving behind its strong, imperial past.

JAMES and the NURSE stand against the wall, still half-

dressed, but already passionately making love...

JAMES (V/O)

I have a theory why women like racing

drivers. It's not because they respect

what we do...driving round and round

in circles. Mostly they think that's

pathetic. And they're probably right..

(a beat)

It's our closeness to death.

JAMES and the NURSE continue noisily, tirelessly making love

in the shower...

JAMES (V/O)

The closer you are to death, the more

alive you FEEL...the more alive you

ARE. And they can see that in you.

FEEL that in you. The way you live.

Willing to risk everything.

11   CONTINUED:                                                   11

JAMES (V/O) (contid)

With no thought for tomorrow...as if

each day is your last. It's a

wonderful way to live...and the ONLY

way to drive. The only way to get that

tenth of a second on everyone else...

The lovemaking becomes more intense...

JAMES (V/O)

To dare to be one step bolder...one

step faster...

JAMES is covered in perspiration, out on the edge...

JAMES (V/O)

Sure one step closer to death...

JAMES and the NURSE, both screaming as they approach orgasm...

JAMES (V/O)

But one step closer to victory, too...

JAMES and the NURSE both climax together...and collapse on the

bed. Exhausted.

12   EXT. CRYSTAL PALACE RACE TRACK - DAY                             12

A grotty old race track in South London.

JAMES and the NURSE arrive at Crystal Palace race track in his

battered old mini. They get out. She looks up, seeing the

mechanics, the racing teams, the cars..

NURSE

I've never been to a Grand Prix

before.

JAMES

You still haven't. This is Formula 3.

NURSE

What's that?

JAMES

A lower division. Where people like me

mess about in the hope of finding

sponsors or being talent-spotted to

race in Formula 1.

JAMES leads the NURSE into...

10

13   THE PADDOCK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY                               13

The pits where JAMES introduces her to his team...

JAMES

Everyone, this is Nursie.

NURSIE

(correcting)

Gemma...

JAMES

Nursie, this is Doc our designer...

DOC

How do you do?

JAMES

Bubbles, our chief mechanic.

BUBBLES

How do you do?

JAMES

Le Patron - Alexander, Lord Hesketh.

HESKETH

How do you do?

NURSE

Fine, thanks. Blimey...is everyone in

Formula 3 this posh?

HESKETH

Glass of champagne, Nursie?

NURSE

It's Gemma. No, thanks.

HESKETH

You sure? It's Krug. Clos de Mesnil.

NURSE

It's also ten in the morning.

HESKETH

Oh, dear. Superstar? You haven't

brought us a bore, have you?

JAMES strips off, changing into his racing overalls.

JAMES

Trust me. Nursie's anything BUT a

bore..

(CONTINUED)

11

13   CONTINUED:                                                     13

The NURSE, meanwhile, drifts over to look at the car where

BUBBLES is making last minute checks...

NURSE

That's the car?

BUBBLES

That's her. The Dastle Mk 9...with the

Lotus twin-cam sixteen hundred engine.

She's no beauty. But goes like the

clappers.

An odd-looking car. A bit like a giant Go-kart, blue with

yellow strips along the side and James's name in small

letters. It looks small, dangerously fragile.

JAMES

Uuuurrrrrkkkkkkggghghhhh.

The NURSE is shocked to hear a dreadful watery vomiting sound.

She sees JAMES bent over behind the truck...

HESKETH

Nothing to be worried about! Does it

before every race! Good sign,

actually. Means he's stoked!

14   EXT. PADDOCK - SAME TIME                                         14

JAMES continues vomiting...

JAMES (V/O)

There's a lie that all drivers tell

themselves. "Death is something that

happens to other people." That's how

you find the courage to get in the car

in the first place...

JAMES emerges, wiping his mouth...

HESKETH

All right, Superstar?

JAMES

Never better, Patron.

JAMES (V/O)

Because bad things only happen to

others, right?

HESKETH

Have a gargle with this.

(CONTINUED)

12

14   CONTINUED:                                                     14

JAMES takes a quick swig of the champagne...gargles, then

swallows, puts on his balaclava...

JAMES (V/O)

Problem is deep down you know that's a

lie. That it could happen to you at

any moment.

HESKETH

Quick toke of this...

HESKETH passes over a joint, which JAMES inhales, taking a

huge lungful from....

JAMES (V/O)

So how do you make that terror go

away? Well, booze is good for that.

And wacky baccy. But better than

everything else is...sex.

JAMES goes to the NURSE...and kisses her full on the lips,

then puts on his helmet, and athletically vaults into the car.

JAMES hits the ignition, and a deafening high-pitched SCREAM

as the engine starts...

HESKETH

Ahhhh! What music! They could never

have predicted it, those pioneers that

invented the automobile that it would

possess us like this, in our

imaginations, our dreams. Nursie, men

love women...but even more than that,

men love CARS...

15   EXT. PADDOCK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY                              15

JAMES notices another driver (NIKI LAUDA), his car already

unloaded, (number 35) and mechanics working on it..

JAMES

Who's that?

DOC

He's new. Some German.

BUBBLES

(corrects)

Austrian.

JAMES

Is there a difference?

(CONTINUED)

13

15   CONTINUED:                                                     15

JAMES looks over. On the side of the car, painted markings, in

the form of a signature, "Niki Lauda".

JAMES

All bloody Goosesteppers.

16   EXT. RACE TRACK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY                           16

JAMES is neck and neck with NIKI. They go into a corner.

NIKI gets there first. Up ahead though, approaching the second

bend...JAMES sees the tiniest, slimmest crack to overtake. No

right-minded driver would risk it. Only a suicidal maniac.

Which just happens to describe JAMES perfectly..

JAMES goes for it. Daringly. Brilliantly. And forces NIKI to

slam on his brakes to prevent a certain crash...

17   EXT. PITS - SAME TIME                                            17

HESKETH, BUBBLES, DOC and the NURSE watch from the

sidelines...

BUBBLES

That move was suicide!

HESKETH

It was also quite brilliant!! God he's

got balls!!

18   EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY                                            18

JAMES carries on driving. Flat out.

But on the flat, NIKI suddenly comes out of nowhere. As if his

car has 50 bhp more.

And overtakes JAMES. NIKI begins to pull away. And has the

Englishman beaten..

JAMES sees red mist...and in an act of do-or-die vengeful

madness, JAMES goes into a corner far too fast...

...yanks his steering wheel. And outrageously shunts NIKI's

car. An unforgivable act of unsportsmanlike vindictiveness.

NIKI and JAMES's cars both veer off...go into wild, lethal

spins..but luckily for JAMES he ends up facing the right

way...

(CONTINUED)

14

18   CONTINUED:                                                      18

...and despite being badly shaken, dizzy, JAMES is able to

change gears, and continue driving...

NIKI's car, by contrast, has stalled...and now ends up facing

THE WRONG WAY on the track...

NIKI's eyes look up to see all the cars coming over a brow,

like a herd of Wildebeest, heading towards him...

NIKI

Umgotteswillen...

NIKI rips open his seat-belt, is about to get out of his car,

when one car shoots straight over the nose of his car.

NIKI ducks, then bravely leaps for cover, as....

"SMASH", one of the oncoming cars shunts into his car, (it

would have killed him instantly).

"WHAM", another car narrowly misses him...

"CRASH", another car forces NIKI into an evasive dive...

Cars scream past him on all sides as the race continues...

NIKI, battered, shaken, has had an unbelievably close escape.

He rips off his helmet, furious...

And now we see NIKI LAUDA's face for the first time. Sharp-

featured. Intelligent eyes. Dark hair. Protruding teeth.

Something unmistakably rat-like about him.

19   EXT. CRYSTAL PALACE RACE TRACK - LATE AFTERNOON                 19

JAMES is on the podium, having won. He's with the NURSE, and

HESKETH and BUBBLES and his team, spraying them with

champagne..

NIKI walks past the podium, holding his blue helmet, and

shouts out, still incandescent...

NIKI

Hey...asshole! That was my line! I had

that corner...

JAMES

You mean the one you spun out of? And

finished facing the other way? I think

that corner had you.

Laughter.

(CONTINUED)

19   CONTINUED:                                                     19

NIKI

That move was total suicide. What if I

hadn't braked? We'd have crashed..!!

JAMES

But we didn't, did we? Thanks to your

impeccable `survival' instincts...

JAMES makes chicken noises...

NIKI

Fuck you! What's your name?

HESKETH

James Simon Wallis Hunt. Remember it,

my little Jerry friend. Because one

day he will be World Champion.

JAMES

Jawohl. Remember ze name. Very simple.

"Hunt". It rhymes with....

"BEEEEP", a car horn hoots nearby, blocking out JAMES's c-word

insult...

JAMES

...a word that happens to describe you

perfectly.

Laughter. NIKI gives JAMES the finger, "Screw you, asshole".

The NURSE watches NIKI go..

NURSE

Who was that?

JAMES

No one. Chippy little Kraut. Bad

loser. Forget him.

NIKI continues to walk off, middle finger raised..

20   EXT. VIENNA SKYLINE - DAY                                        20

To establish: the Austrian capital. OVER THIS: the sound of

NIKI's voice...

NIKI (V/O)

In my home town, Vienna, my family is

famous for one thing. Business. My

grandfather was a businessman, my

father, too...

16

21   INT. NIKI'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      21

NIKI is in front of a mirror, and dresses smartly in a jacket,

and open necked shirt, evidently a little nervous...

NIKI (V/O)

So when they heard I wanted to race

cars for a living, they had a few

things to say...

22   INT. LAUDA GRANDFATHER HOUSE - NIGHT                             22

A large, forbidding dining room. NIKI's FATHER and terrifying

GRANDFATHER, are eating supper. GRANDFATHER shakes his head,

clearly disapproves and barks in German...(we see subtitles)

GRANDFATHER

Never! Racing is for playboys and

dilettantes. Frivolous amateurs with

nothing in their heads. The name

`Lauda' appears on the front pages,

with politicians and economists, not

on the back pages with...

(gestures in contempt)

...footballers and skiers. If you want

my money, you do as I say and follow

me into my business..

NIKI stares at his GRANDFATHER..

NIKI (V/O)

It's in moments like this that you

discover who you really are..

...and in a move that he knows will rupture the family for

ever, NIKI gets to his feet..

NIKI

Fine. Keep your money. Don't invest in

me. But when I'm World Champion, and I

have the trophy, and my name is not

just on the back pages, but on the

front too, you will regret it.

NIKI walks out, the old man's insults ringing in his ears...

GRANDFATHER

You dare sit at my table and lecture

me on what I will or won't regret? Get

out! Impertinent wretch! Consider

yourself disowned!

17

23   INT. RAIFEISENKASSE - BANK - DAY                                23

NIKI is in a meeting with visibly concerned BANKERS and

LAWYERS. They speak in German...

BANKER

Another loan? Herr Lauda, you still

haven't repaid the other...

BANKER 2

Three..

BANKER

Totalling millions of Schillings. Plus

your Grandfather called to inform us

he will no longer be offering

security.

NIKI

I know. There is no room for failure.

I understand that.

NIKI (V/O)

But I was still a Lauda...

24   INT. NIKI'S CAR/ ROAD TO VIENNA AIRPORT - DAY                   24

NIKI is driving his car. Beside him, is the attache case on

his lap. His car passes under a motorway sign reading

"Flughafen". (Airport)...

NIKI (V/O)

...which meant I was still a

businessman above everything else.

25   EXT. VIENNA AIRPORT - DAY                                       25

A private jet. A balding, blazered Englishman in late middle-

age (LOUIS STANLEY), owner of BRM racing, disembarks onto the

tarmac...

NIKI (V/O)

It just so happens that the business I

deal in is speed.

26   INT. VIENNA AIRPORT - CAFE                                      26

NIKI sits with LOUIS STANLEY in an airport cafe.

Contracts are open on the table. NIKI is signing. LOUIS

STANLEY is counter-signing...

STANLEY

In return for your money you get a

car, mechanics and a place on the

team. Plus fifty per cent of starting

fees and bonuses for podium finishes.

NIKI

Who's the number one driver?

STANLEY

Clay Regazzoni and you will defer to

him at all times.

NIKI takes out his cheque book and pen. He looks up...

NIKI

Why would I defer to him if I am

paying his wages?

NIKI writes the cheque. STANLEY's smile fades..

STANLEY

Because he's a proven winner at the

highest level, a good guy, and someone

who quite frankly, could teach you a

thing or two.

NIKI ignores this, continues scrutinizing the contract...

NIKI

OK. There is one clause missing.

STANLEY

The one about mechanics' exclusivity?

Sorry. We have a cardinal rule at BRM.

All information is shared between ALL

our drivers..

NIKI

And I made it perfectly clear that my

mechanics work for me. No one else.

This is something I cannot sign.

NIKI takes back the cheque. STANLEY stares...

STANLEY

All right. I'll have the lawyers amend

it.

NIKI

While you're at it you can tell them

to amend the clause for podium

finishes. Podium is first THREE

places, not just wins.

NIKI puts the cheque in his attache case. Snaps it shut,

taking it with him..

NIKI

You'll get the money on signature, as

agreed. See you at winter testing.

NIKI gets to his feet, and leaves. STANLEY watches the attache

case disappear.

STANLEY

If that little git drives half as well

as he negotiates, we're going to be

fine.

28   INT. AWARD CEREMONY - NIGHT                                      28

An awards ceremony is in progress. The room is thick with

cigar and cigarette smoke. A presenter on stage, wearing black

tie...

PRESENTER

I'm delighted to say the winner of the

British Guild of Motoring Writers

award for the `Most Promising Driver

of the Year' is James Hunt...

A loud, boisterous cheer goes up at the Hesketh Racing table.

JAMES turns to a (new/different) girlfriend beside him, gives

her a lingering kiss on the lips, then gets to his feet,

shakes hands with HESKETH, and BUBBLES and skips up to the

podium...

JAMES

Thank you. My parents always wanted me

to be a doctor, or stockbroker, and

gave me a first class education...but

to no avail. My brothers are the

success stories. I get bored easily. I

have a hot head, an inability to

tolerate discipline. I fall out with

people left and right. I'm quick to

settle matters with my fists. The only

creatures I've ever loved and treated

well, are budgerigars. In any normal

area of life, I'd be...or AM...a total

liability. All I've got going for me

is I'm quick in a car.

A good-looking woman calls out..

WOMAN

That's not all!

Laughter.

JAMES

So thank you for acknowledging that.

And giving me this...

(indicating trophy)

I'm going to give it to my Dad, and

tell him to put it on the mantle-piece

and imagine it's a first class degree

in medicine.

29   INT. AWARDS CEREMONY - LATER                                    29

Afterwards: everyone is celebrating. Thanks to JAMES, every

pretty woman in the club is around. The trophy is perched

beside bottles of champagne...

HESKETH

Well done, Superstar. One more season

in F2 then I'll move you up. To the

big time.

JAMES

You don't think I'm ready now?

HESKETH

You are! I'm not! I've got to find you

a car first. And the money. The

economics of Formula 1 are terrifying.

BUBBLES

Hurry up. You don't want him to do

what Lauda did.

`Pop', HESKETH opens a bottle of champagne...

BUBBLES (contid)

The Goosestepper. Remember him?

JAMES makes the chicken noises again..

BUBBLES

Said he no longer wanted to risk his

life with "a bunch of crazy amateurs

and losers..."

JAMES

Is that what he called us?

(CONTINUED)

DOC

Charming!

HESKETH

Nothing wrong with being an amateur!

BUBBLES

Said if he was going to risk his life,

he would only do so on the big

roulette table. Formula 1. So he got

himself a drive with BRM.

JAMES

What? How? He never won a thing! Not a

single bloody race.

HESKETH

Amateurs are what made this country

great.

BUBBLES

Took out a loan, apparently. Paid for

it himself.

HESKETH

"In war, as in lovemaking, amateurs

are invariably better than

professionals." Napoleon Bonaparte.

BUBBLES

A hundred and fifty grand!

JAMES

A hundred and fifty grand?

JAMES stares. Already sick with envy.

JAMES

That's either an act of utter lunacy,

or the ballsiest thing I ever heard.

30   INT/EXT. RECEPTION PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - FRANCE - DAY           30

The PAUL RICARD circuit near Marseilles in the South of

France. Where all winter training and testing is done.

NIKI arrives. An attractive woman (AGNES) greets him...

NIKI

Niki Lauda. Here for pre-season

testing. BRM?

AGNES

Take a seat, please. I'll get someone

to come and collect you...

NIKI watches as she telephones the BRM workshops...

AGNES

Hi. There's someone here for you?

NIKI

(prompting)

Lauda.

AGNES

(misunderstanding, speaking

louder)

SOMEONE HERE TO SEE YOU.

She hangs up. NIKI decides against pointing out her mistake.

AGNES

They'll be right here.

NIKI

Thank you.

A silence. The RECEPTIONIST continues with her work. NIKI

watches her, unsure what to say, (small-talk not his forte)...

NIKI

Worked here long?

AGNES

Excuse me?

NIKI

Just wondered if you've worked here

long?

AGNES

Almost eight years.

NIKI

That long? And they didn't promote you

yet?

AGNES

Yes, several times. I am the AGNES.

Agnes Bonnet. If you're looking for

the receptionist, she's on her lunch.

NIKI is thrown. Feels humiliated. A total jerk. He is about to

say something when the door opens, and...

Two other F1 DRIVERS walk in..

30   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  30

Glamorous, long-haired, tanned, fashionable - like rock stars,

they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with AGNES.

What are you doing answering the phones? New haircut! Like it.

What have you done to the weather?

They make her laugh. And smile.

NIKI feels invisible. Embarrassed. Awkward. Inadequate. He

gets to his feet. And goes to the car that has come to collect

him.

As he goes, (unseen by NIKI), AGNES watches him. Ignoring the

other DRIVERS. Intrigued.

He's different. Interesting. Intense. Intelligent eyes.

31   EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - DAY                                         31

The car pulls up outside the workshops. NIKI gets out of the

car, and is greeted by LOUIS STANLEY, and the BRM team...

STANLEY

Niki, let me introduce you to our

number 1 driver, Clay Regazzoni..and

our number 2, Jean Pierre Beltoise..

The intimidating, muscular, moustachioed figure of CLAY

REGAZZONI, the Swiss driver. NIKI and CLAY shake hands.

STANLEY

And these are your mechanics,

reporting exclusively to you. As per

contract...

REGAZZONI, BELTOISE and STANLEY exchange looks as NIKI shakes

hands, ad-libbed greetings with his MECHANICS.

MECHANIC

You want to see the car?

32   INT/EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - DAY                                     32

NIKI is led into the workshop to see a red and white Marlboro

sponsored car, number 21, with a tall air-intake duct just

above the driver's helmet...

MECHANIC

There she is. The P160..

NIKI

Same as Regazzoni's?

(CONTINUED)

32   CONTINUED:                                                     32

MECHANIC

Identical in every detail.

NIKI scrutinizes the car...

NIKI

She looks heavy. How much does she

weigh?

MECHANIC

540 kilos.

NIKI

That's crazy. Why so heavy..?

MECHANIC

It's a 3 litre, V12 engine, that thing

weighs 190k alone.

NIKI

What horsepower are you getting out of

it?

MECHANIC

450.

NIKI

Not enough. Needs to be 500 and the

engine needs to be 20k lighter.

MECHANIC

We already tried...

NIKI

Did you use magnesium parts?

The MECHANICS look at one another skeptically...

33   INT. BRM WORKSHOPS - NIGHT                                      33

Shooting from above:

The entire car has been stripped to a thousand pieces. Now

spread all over the workshop floor.

NIKI's team of mechanics reluctantly work through the night

making the adjustments which NIKI is suggesting...

NIKI

Any solid plate, strip it out...

More disbelieving, skeptical looks. The car is in pieces on

the floor. NIKI brews coffee to keep people alert. Focused.

NIKI

And when we've done that, we need to

look at the aerodynamics. Front and

rear wing..

More mutinous looks. "Who is this asshole?"

34   EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - FIRST LIGHT                                 34

Daylight breaks over the race-track. The doors to the workshop

open, and the MECHANICS and NIKI emerge - their work done.

NIKI goes to shake hands with the MECHANICS...

NIKI

OK. Thank you. Good night..

But they're exhausted. Refuse to shake hands with this nut.

35   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                   35

LATER: one of the BRM cars screams round the race-track...

NIKI watches on the sidelines as CLAY REGAZZONI is time-

testing his car. He walks over to where LOUIS STANLEY and

several MECHANICS are doing the timings...

NIKI

What was his time?

STANLEY

Two minutes six seconds.

NIKI

OK. Now put him in my car, and he'll

go round under two minutes.

STANLEY

Six seconds faster? Impossible.

NIKI looks up to see AGNES, the attractive TRACK MANAGER again

on the other side of the track.

NIKI waves hi. AGNES waves back. Smiles. NIKI raises his

eyebrow. Surprised.

36   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                   36

REGAZZONI gets into NIKI's car.

REGAZZONI races round the track at full speed.

REGAZZONI roars past the finishing line in NIKI's car. LOUIS

STANLEY looks at the stop watch..

His expression changes.

38   INT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                 38

STANLEY comes into the workshop where NIKI and his MECHANICS

are in conversation, getting changed...

STANLEY

All right. What did you do to the car?

NIKI

That's information I will share with

you under certain conditions only.

STANLEY stares, bracing himself..

STANLEY

Go on...

NIKI

A guaranteed place in the team, and a

paid contract on equal terms with

Regazzoni for two years.

STANLEY

Are you crazy? Clay's a senior figure

in Formula One...you're a rookie. The

only reason we took you ON was because

you were paying us.

NIKI

Well, as of now, if you want me to

stay, we rip up the contract. I don't

pay you a cent.

STANLEY

It's outrageous.

NIKI

Was he quicker in my car? He was,

wasn't he?

STANLEY stares...

NIKI

Did he go under two minutes?

One fifty-six.

NIKI

So have a think, work out your

priorities, and get back to me.

NIKI turns, and goes. STANLEY stares...

STANLEY

Not even my WIFE speaks to me like

that.

39   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                   39

CLAY REGAZZONI emerges from testing his car. Still amazed by

the improved performance. Talking to his MECHANICS. In awe.

He removes his helmet, then stops.

In the distance he sees NIKI talking to AGNES the attractive

TRACK MANAGER. They are clearly hitting it off..

40   INT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - WORKSHOPS - LOCKER-ROOM - DAY         40

NIKI is in the showers, then getting changed for his date with

AGNES. He is about to go, when he stops, and sees...

CLAY REGAZZONI getting undressed, looking at NIKI. CLAY speaks

English with an Italian accent..

REGAZZONI

I know what you're going to say. That

it's none of my business...

NIKI

What?

REGAZZONI

If it's the Track Manager you're

taking on your date tonight?

NIKI immediately becomes defensive...

NIKI

It's none of your business.

REGAZZONI

Okay, but if you want my advice...I'd

let this one go. I'm not questioning

your taste. She's a great girl.

REGAZZONI (contid)

But Agnes's last boyfriend was a

British Formula 2 driver, who has a

reputation for two things. For being a

suicidal jerk on the track, and for

going all night, and all day

afterwards...and all night again in

bed. He's an OK driver, but an

IMMORTAL fuck, apparently. I don't

know about you, but that's not an act

I'd like to follow.

(shrugs)

But if that doesn't bother you...

NIKI

What's his name? The driver?

REGAZZONI

Hunt. James Hunt.

NIKI stares. Can hardly believe it.

REGAZZONI

See? You share information, I share

information.

CLAY slaps NIKI on his back, and goes into the showers..

REGAZZONI

That's what team-mates are for.

NIKI

(quiet/defeated)

Thanks.

HESKETH

Keep them closed...! Wait for it, wait

HESKETH removes JAMES's blindfold...

HESKETH

There! What do you say?

JAMES opens his eyes to see a gorgeous F1 racing car, plain

white, no stickers...

HESKETH

Isn't she a beauty? The March 731.

Converted by the brilliant Doc..!

DOC POSTLETHWAITE takes a modest bow. JAMES shakes hands with

everyone, including his brother, (and manager), PETER..

JAMES

She is a beauty. But...haven't you

made a mistake?

HESKETH

What?

JAMES

That's not a Formula 2 car. She's F1.

HESKETH

She is, Superstar. Why? Because I got

together with the beancounters, and it

turns out that the economics of F1 are

not so significantly different to the

economics of Formula 2...

So we thought if we were going to be

messing about losing money we might as

well be doing it with the big boys.

JAMES

Are you serious?

HESKETH

Never been more serious in my life!

JAMES embraces HESKETH in excitement, kisses him...

HESKETH

Actually, I got the idea after what

you said about the Austrian chap who

bought his way in rather than waste

his time in the lower divisions. I

thought, "Bloody hell, he's right!"

JAMES slips into the cockpit...

JAMES

Well done the Goosestepper!!

HESKETH

(indicates car)

No sponsorship, Superstar! I hope you

approve.

JAMES

I do, Patron.

HESKETH

No vulgar logos for cigarettes, or

condoms. Just plain white. With the

Union Jack. And racing overalls which

HESKETH indicates JAMES's hanging racing overalls...

HESKETH

"Sex. Breakfast of Champions." Unless

it's me, of course, in which case it's

A helicopter comes in to land.

The Hesketh Racing Team makes a grand entrance with a retinue

of BUTLERS, GIRLS, ROLLS' ROYCE's, oysters, champagne...

A famous ex-champion TV REPORTER is there (Stirling Moss)

providing skeptical commentary about Hesketh's debut...

STIRLING MOSS

...hard to tell whether Lord Hesketh

and his team of upper class

enthusiasts is bringing glamour to the

racing community, or just comedy...

They walk around in their own branded clothing. Alexander's

jacket reads, "Le Patron". He speaks to MOSS.

Rolled eyes among other racing teams who express surprise,

curiosity (and frequently disapproval) at these new arrivals..

STIRLING MOSS

It's certainly the first time I can

remember seeing a butler serving

caviar and oysters in the pits...

Suddenly pandemonium breaks out. Screams. Something has

happened. A bad accident on the track. During testing...

STIRLING MOSS

(holding ear-piece)

...reports are reaching me of a

serious accident that has just taken

place in qualifying....

All smiles fade. The party atmosphere changes in a flash.

Panic breaks out.

The sound of sirens. Ambulances rushing to the scene of the

accident. All the JOURNALISTS and TV CREWS rush off, too.

Mangled wreckage. A car has crashed into (badly installed)

Armco guard rails, splitting the railing in two...

The DRIVER has been decapitated. His helmeted HEAD lies

cleanly severed on the ground...

A goldfish-bowl of blood.

It's a horrific accident. People SCREAM and look away. Even

hardened medical professionals...

JAMES, HESKETH, BUBBLES arrive on the scene of the accident.

But they are kept away, at a distance...

STIRLING MOSS

...it seems the driver...just twenty-

six years old....was killed on

impact...and the death toll in Formula

1 shows no sign of slowing down...

47   INT. HESKETH PITS - SPANISH GRAND PRIX - DAY                     47

JAMES, dressed in his overalls, is violently retching. Sick

Formula 1 has lost Piers Courage, Jo

He made a mistake. Went into the

corner too fast.

NIKI

Fine. How's it at the back?

JAMES

Not planning on being there for long.

NIKI

Good. Look forward to you showing me

JAMES

`Be happy to. I'll have you inside lap

NIKI is on the podium, spraying champagne. He is wearing the

victor's garland...

Meanwhile: JAMES's car is embarrassingly being brought back by

a tow-truck. NIKI watches from the podium..

His eyes meet JAMES's..

60   INT. BAR - HOTEL - NIGHT                                         60

JAMES and BUBBLES and PETER HUNT (JAMES's blazer-wearing

manager and elder brother), sit together at a table in the

corner. It's late. A frank post-mortem. Drinking and talking..

JAMES

Niki humiliated me today. He lapped me

three times.

BUBBLES

He lapped Carlos Pace six times.

JAMES

That's supposed to console me? What do

I need to do?

PETER

Grow up.

JAMES

Shut up, Moneyman. `Didn't ask you..

BUBBLES

Your brother's right. You've got to

change your attitude. We all do. And

match it with a whole different mental

approach. Professionalism. Maturity.

Like Niki.

PETER

Bet he doesn't go out every night,

drink and screw himself stupid.

JAMES

So speaks the jealous married man..

PETER

No. So speaks the manager who's

wasting his time, making ten per cent

of absolutely nothing.

BUBBLES

You've just got to take it more

seriously. Yourself more seriously.

PETER

Something he's never done.

JAMES

Don`t patronize me, Pete...

BUBBLES

We need you to spend less time in bars

and nightclubs...

PETER

Make that NO time...

BUBBLES

And more time with the mechanics,

setting up the car. That's what Lauda

does. 24 hours a day.

JAMES rolls his eyes...

BUBBLES

God knows there's nothing wrong with

your talent. Or courage. It's purely a

character issue right now.

JAMES

And the good news is I've got Sigmund

Freud Horsely, failed driver par

excellence, and a washed-up accountant

to lecture me on it.

PETER

(closes eyes)

Jesus, James...

BUBBLES walks off. PETER HUNT walks off. JAMES calls out..

JAMES

Bubbles? I'm sorry..! I didn't mean

that! Come back..!

The grand Hesketh estate in the Northamptonshire countryside.

68   INT. HESKETH RACING WORKSHOPS - EASTON NESTON - DAY             68

JAMES is in the workshops, his hands and arms filthy, he's

been working on the car - but now his eyes are closed.

Memorizing tracks. Around him people are working on the car..

JAMES

....along the Beau Rivage, long left

into Massenet, into the short right of

Casino. Sharp right into Mirabeau,

then sharp left into Loews, mind the

guard rails...

VOICE

Is Alexander around..?

JAMES opens his eyes to see an endless pair of legs, a drop-

dead gorgeous figure, and the beautiful smiling face of SUZY

MILLER, the most successful model of the day.

JAMES

He was. Then went to the house to take

a call. He'll be back shortly.

SUZY

Only he wanted to show off his pride

and joy...

SUZY indicates the car...

SUZY

...rhymes with `boy' if you ask me.

And `toy'. I can't believe what I'm

seeing.

JAMES

Why?

SUZY

It's just so small! For something that

costs so much. And so flimsy. There's

no comfort. No protection. Nothing.

JAMES

No. Just a little coffin, surrounded

by high-octane fuel, being driven

round at 170 miles per hour..

JAMES (contid)

(becoming grave)

To all intents and purposes a bomb. On

wheels.

SUZY

Why don't they make it safer?

JAMES

No one wants it to be. It's like

saying why not make bullfighting

safer? It's a blood sport. The risk of

death turns people on. Without it, I

guess, it'd be half the fun. Which is

fine for the voyeurs, fine for TV,

fine for everyone..

(a beat)

...except us drivers.

SUZY looks JAMES up and down. Sees the bare feet, the rock

star good looks...

SUZY

You're James, aren't you?

JAMES

Yes.

SUZY

Thought so. You fit the description.

(shaking hands)

Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

JAMES

I know exactly.

In the background: one of the MECHANICS shows DOC a picture of

SUZY from a tabloid newspaper. She's clearly the most famous

model in Britain, and a star in her own right...

JAMES

What was the description?

SUZY

Mostly positive in terms of

appearance. Negative only in terms of

character. I've been told to avoid

you.

JAMES

By whom?

SUZY

Alex. He says you're a bad boy.

JAMES

Was. Not any more. New me very

professional. Early to bed. Early to

rise. All very dull.

SUZY

Really?

JAMES

Round-the-clock work, practise and

focus. Tedious, but apparently the

only way to vin against ze

Goosestepper..

SUZY

Is that what you were doing when you

came in?

JAMES

Visualization techniques. Memorizing

the circuit, in this case Monaco,

which is next up. Eyes closed, know

your way round in your sleep...

(a beat)

I know...I've always been a great

believer in getting there on the day,

putting the old foot down and playing

chicken with everyone else.

SUZY laughs..

JAMES

But they don't want me to do that

anymore...they want my body like a

temple. My mind like Monk.

SUZY

And your soul? Your heart?

JAMES

What does that mean?

SUZY

You can't be so disciplined in all

areas of your life, can you..?

JAMES

They want me to stop messing around,

get married and settle down with the

next nice girl I meet. They think it

would be good for me.

SUZY

What do you think?

SUZY laughs again...

JAMES

But since they're right about most

things, they're probably right about

that, too.

JAMES looks SUZY up and down...

JAMES

You don't fancy getting married, do

you?

69   EXT. BROMPTON ORATORY CHURCH - LONDON - DAY                      69

JAMES and SUZY, top hat and tails, flowing white wedding

dress, looking ravishing, emerge from the church.

JAMES and SUZY fall into a passionate, sexy embrace for the

paparazzi cameras. Loud cheers go up, led by HESKETH and

BUBBLES.

They make their way to the waiting convoy of cars...

On his way: JAMES spots a serious-faced HESKETH and DOC

POSTLETHWAITE in conversation with some Formula 1 types in the

crowd..

SUZY is pulled away for photos. Clearly a bigger star even

than JAMES. JAMES turns to BUBBLES, indicates HESKETH...

JAMES

BUBBLES

Nothing. I don't want to ruin your

day.

BUBBLES stares, then reluctantly...

Goosestepper might have to wait a

little longer than you'd hoped.

(a beat)

He's just been signed by Ferrari.

JAMES

WHAT??? But that's the best team in

the world. They could have ANYONE. Did

he pay his way in there, too?

BUBBLES

Apparently they took back Regazzoni

and he insisted they give Lauda a

trial. Thinks he's a genius. Setting

up the cars...

JAMES stares...then is pulled away to pose in photographs with

SUZY and her FAMILY.

ENZO FERRARI himself, the Commendatore, a formidable white-

haired patriarch in Onassis dark glasses, reads newspapers,

sitting by the race tracks, barely looking up as two red

Ferrari's roar round the track...

LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO, the young, dynamic, aristocratic manager

of the Scuderia, by contrast, watches eagle-eyed..

distribution is a disaster...

The MECHANIC gulps, then walks over to where the terrifying

COMMENDATORE and LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO are sitting, and passes

on the information...

MECHANIC

He says the car is magnificent, a

masterpiece, but he has suggestions

for one or two minor refinements...

You're friend and family to the

Commendatore as long as you win. The

minute you don't..

(mimes execution)

NIKI

I understand. It's business. I would

be the same.

REGAZZONI

But it isn't just business, is it?

What we do? It's passion. Love. Which

is why we're prepared to risk our

lives for it.

NIKI

Not me. If I thought I had more talent

and could earn better money doing

something else, I would.

REGAZZONI

But how do you know you will make

money here? You haven't yet.

NIKI

Not yet. But I will.

(smiles)

If you can, I can.

REGAZZONI shakes his head, can't help smiling...

REGAZZONI

You know, are you ever NOT an asshole?

NIKI laughs...

NIKI

Why am I an asshole? You know by now

I'm both quicker than you and better

at setting up the car. You can't deal

with that, then you're the asshole.

REGAZZONI

Screw you.

REGAZZONI pulls up outside the house...

REGAZZONI (contid)

I brought you along today because you

seem like a lonely kind of guy. I

thought if I introduce you to some

nice people, it'd be good for you.

Forget it. Make your own friends.

NIKI stares through the window. Inside: a very appealing

looking bunch - young, good-looking, cool, sexy GUESTS - all

having a good time..

By contrast: NIKI catches his own reflection in the glass

reflection. Pale. Intense. The outsider.

Inside: REGAZZONI is surrounded by friends, telling a story.

Everyone laughs.

NIKI watches. Then turns to walk away. As he goes, the front

door opens...

And a beautiful dark-haired woman (MARLENE) emerges loading

several BAGS into a car. Brunette, tan. Wearing a white dress.

NIKI

Are you leaving?

MARLENE

Yes.

NIKI

Can you give me a lift to the nearest

town? Anywhere with a train station.

MARLENE

Sure. Nearest town is half an hour's

drive. Get in.

accelerate?

MARLENE

No.

NIKI

Your drive belt is loose.

MARLENE

My what?

NIKI

Alternator. And when you brake, your

foot goes all the way down. Means

there's air in the system.

MARLENE

Anything else?

NIKI

No. Apart from the rear brakes are

imbalanced. The front right wheel is

flat, and it feels like a crack in the

engine block...which explains why

you're drifting so much.

MARLENE

How can you tell?

NIKI

My ass.

MARLENE

What?

NIKI

God gave me an OK mind, but a really

good ass, which can feel everything in

a car.

MARLENE

You don't know what you're talking

about. The car is fine. And it just

had a service a week ago.

NIKI

Not a good one.

MARLENE

A very good one. From a proper garage.

It cost a fortune. This car is good as

new. Relax.

79   EXT. MOTORWAY - HARD SHOULDER - DAY                             79

White smoke pours from the engine. The car has broken down.

Bonnet up. NIKI has tried fixing it, but to no avail.

NIKI has a fan belt in his hand, but it's all but

disintegrated under the heat of the over-worked engine.

NIKI's hands are covered in oil. He is pushing a pen into a

large crack in the engine, slick with oil and grease.

NIKI

Nothing I can do here. The car needs a

garage.

MARLENE

I'm sorry. You're not in a hurry, are

you?

NIKI

No. As long as I'm back in Maranello

by Monday morning.

NIKI walks out into the road. Sticks out his thumb...

MARLENE

So who are you anyway?

MARLENE breaks into GERMAN...(we see sub-titles)...

MARLENE

You're from Vienna, aren't you. We can

speak German. How do you know Curd?

NIKI

Who's Curd?

MARLENE

Curd Jurgens. The actor. It's his

house. He is, or was until yesterday,

my boyfriend. I must have been mad!

There is something very attractive

about an older man when they behave

like one. But when they behave like a

frightened child..

MARLENE gets to her feet...

MARLENE

C'mon, let me do this. Otherwise we'll

never get out of here. We're in Italy,

after all.

MARLENE indicates that NIKI should take a back seat, hitches

up her skirt, showing long, tanned legs..

Immediately a passing car screeches to a halt, then reverses

noisily to pull level. MARLENE smiles at NIKI...

MARLENE

Not bad, eh? Three seconds. Admit it,

you're impressed..!

MARLENE smiles flirtatiously at the handsome, young Italian

MEN driving the open-topped sports car..

MARLENE

Ciao, Regazzi...!

But the Italian MEN walk right past her, not seeing her, as if

she's invisible, and stare at NIKI...

ITALIAN MAN

Excuse me...are you Niki Lauda?

NIKI

Yes.

ITALIAN MAN

Oh, my God...!!! I told you it was

him..!!!

(blown away)

Do you need a ride?

NIKI

Yes, we do...

The ITALIAN MAN gestures to his car, as his friend loads

MARLENE's luggage inside...

ITALIAN MAN

An honour, please!!! But on one

condition..

The ITALIAN MAN whisper in NIKI's ear. MARLENE stares, not

understanding, as NIKI protests, but then slowly, reluctantly

gets into the car. He starts the engine.

MARLENE watches as the ITALIAN MEN strap themselves in with

the seat-belts, tightening them...giggling like schoolboys..

ITALIAN MAN

You don't know? He's a Formula I

MARLENE

Him? Never. Impossible!

ITALIAN MAN

Why?

MARLENE

Formula 1 drivers have long hair, are

sexy, have shirts open to here..

MARLENE indicates...

MARLENE

Anyway, look at the way he's driving!!

Like an old man!!

It's true. NIKI is driving in the slow lane. Like a pensioner.

NIKI

No need to drive fast. It only

increases the percentage of risk.

We're not in a hurry. No one is paying

me. Right now, with zero incentive or

reward, why would I drive fast?

MARLENE looks at him with her dark green eyes...

MARLENE

(in German)

Because I'm asking you to.

NIKI

(in German)

And do you always get what you want?

MARLENE

(in German)

Usually.

NIKI stares, trying to resist...but cannot. He does a

lightning double-declutch...

rev counter flies to the right...

MARLENE

Oh, my God...!!

The ITALIAN MEN scream in excitement, holding on for dear life

as NIKI, his heart not a beat over 60, takes the car to

breaking point, in a way it's never been driven before...

NIKI overtakes everyone on the motorway, fearlessly weaving

between cars at twice their speed..

We CLOSE on NIKI's eyes, remaining dead calm as his passengers

MARLENE watches on TV in the pits as NIKI is engaged in an

epic tussle with JAMES...

Commentators note the improvement in JAMES's technique,

maturity and performance. But then, "Puff", a plume of smoke

Immediately JAMES loses speed, and NIKI sails past, overtaking

the crowds, accepting everyone's congratulations..

He runs into JAMES, who's in bare feet as usual. MARLENE is

pulled away to talk to someone else..

JAMES

Congratulations.

NIKI

Thank you.

JAMES

Though with a car like that, the rest

of us never stood a chance...

NIKI

Maybe the fact the car is so good

might have something to do with me.

JAMES

You're still in a Ferrari. And I'm

still in a Hesketh. On equal terms,

the way it was in Formula 3, I'd beat

you, and you know it.

NIKI

Never. You might get lucky and win one

race. Maybe two. Because you're

aggressive. But in the long run, over

the course of a season, no chance.

JAMES

Why's that?

NIKI

Because you're not serious. You're

just a party guy. Which is why

everyone likes you.

JAMES

Now try saying that and tell me you're

not jealous.

NIKI

But all that affection, all those

smiles is also a sign of their

disrespect! They don't fear you.

Whereas compare that to me...

JAMES

Whom no one likes...

NIKI

Right..

JAMES

Not even his own team-mates..

NIKI

Right! Because I'm relentless. I don't

screw up. I go to bed early. I look

after myself, look after my car. And

then, soon as the race is finished, I

go home. You should go home more

often, too. I heard you got married.

JAMES

I did.

NIKI

So where is she?

JAMES

In New York. Working.

NIKI

You know I've never seen you with her,

once...

NIKI turns to MARLENE, "Let's go"..

84   EXT. EASTON NESTON - DAY                                        84

JAMES's Mini roars furiously up the long gravel driveway

towards Easton Neston. Screeches to a halt.

JAMES gets out of the car. Is greeted by staff, whom he

uncharacteristically ignores, storming past...

85   INT. EASTON NESTON - WORKSHOP - DAY                             85

JAMES walks into the workshops where BUBBLES HORSLEY is busy

doing something...

JAMES

Right, whatever it takes to beat

Lauda, just say it, your word is my

command. I'll do it. There are no

lengths to which I will not go. And I

mean it this time...

JAMES stops, noticing BUBBLES's expression...

JAMES

What's the matter?

Then JAMES notices what BUBBLES is doing. He's packing.

JAMES

What are you doing?

Then JAMES notices the lack of activity in the workshops. None

of the usual mechanics, or engineers..

JAMES

Where is everyone?

BUBBLES looks up. Unsure how to break it to him.

86   INT. DRAWING-ROOM - EASTON NESTON - DAY                          86

An old drawing-room. The open fire roars. But HESKETH is

uncharacteristically quiet. Defeated..

HESKETH

Do you know what the date is today?

JAMES

November 14th.

HESKETH

Do you have any idea of the

significance of that date?

JAMES

I'm assuming it refers to some animal

you are allowed or no longer allowed

to slaughter on your estate.

HESKETH

Actually it's the deadline for

securing sponsorship for the

forthcoming Formula 1 season.

(a beat)

Which elapsed at midnight last night.

And we didn't attract any.

JAMES

So? We aren't looking for sponsorship.

Condoms and cigarettes. Vulgar, right?

HESKETH

Right. Except we are. Or were. I've

made something of a miscalculation.

The economics. Formula 1. Reality

thereof. Turns out not like the lower

divisions at all.

JAMES

What are you saying?

HESKETH

I'm saying it's over, Superstar. The

banks have stepped in. Read me the

riot act. Started laying everyone off.

Probably have to sell this place. Fun

while it lasted, would do it all again

and all that...

(ashen)

I daren't tell you the actual figures.

JAMES stares at a devastated HESKETH...

JAMES

Christ.

87   INT. JAMES'S FLAT - LONDON - NIGHT                              87

JAMES is on the phone to his brother PETER, while playing

Scale-electrix cars on a track alone, barefoot...

JAMES

I need a drive, Pete. Need you to find

me a drive.

(listens)

What does that mean? "My reputation

precedes me?"

"Crash", the electric toy car crashes...

JAMES

(listens)

Really? Is that what they said?

(a beat)

Did they at least say a "Quick

arsehole?"

(listens)

Bollocks to Lotus. Find me someone

else. I'll go mad otherwise.

"Click", JAMES hangs up. SUZY walks in. Sees his mood..

SUZY

Don't worry. Something will turn up.

JAMES opens a bottle of Scotch, pours himself a drink...

SUZY

But I doubt that will help in the

meantime.

JAMES knocks back the drink...

SUZY

Why don't we go away for the week-end?

Before I leave again for New York?

JAMES carries on drinking..

SUZY

Talk to me, James. Don't make a

stranger of me.

JAMES doesn't react...

SUZY

I can't watch this.

SUZY picks up her coat, and bag..

JAMES

What were you hoping for? A well-

adjusted knight in shining armour?

SUZY

No danger of that....

JAMES

Let me give you some advice.

SUZY

I'm all ears...

JAMES

Don't go to men who are willing to

kill themselves driving in circles

looking for normality.

SUZY

Well, I certainly didn't get that...

JAMES

Should have gone for one of my

brothers.

SUZY

There goes that self-pity again.

How striking it is -

JAMES

What's that? Tell me..

SUZY

The gulf between appearance and

reality. Look at you, all sunshine

blonde beauty and smiles...yet the

reality is...a frightened, immature,

depressed, self-pitying child...

JAMES

At least there's SOMETHING behind the

facade.

SUZY

With a nasty temper..

JAMES

Fuck off to New York, dear. There must

be a moisturizer or eye shadow

somewhere that needs your vapid mush

to flog it.

SUZY

How quickly beauty can turn ugly.

JAMES

Agreed. Repellent.

SUZY stares...and goes. JAMES carries on drinking.

The following morning. The phone rings. Piercing the darkness.

JAMES, clearly the worse for wear, is talking to his beloved

A surprising vulnerability, and childlike innocence about

JAMES. He strokes the birds with real tenderness..

The phone continues ringing. JAMES picks it up...

Hello?

JAMES listens, then hears something on the phone that makes

him sit up...

JAMES (INTO PHONE)

Who? McLaren?

JAMES is waking rapidly now..

JAMES (INTO PHONE)

Just get me in a room with them, Pete.

Say anything. Today? Yes, I can do

today.

(checks watch)

I can be there in an hour.

JAMES starts scribbling down the address.

91   EXT. MCLAREN HQ - TO ESTABLISH                                   91

The headquarters of McLaren Racing in Colnbrook, Bucks.

A small, unassuming building on the Poyle Trading Estate. Bare

brickwork surrounds a brash yellow facade, with the words

`MCLAREN RACING' in large white letters.

92   INT. MCLAREN HQ - BOARDROOM - DAY                                92

A large boardroom. Team Director TEDDY MAYER (American, from

Pennsylvania, short, lawyerly, 50's - hair turning grey) sits

at the head of the table.

Next to him is Aussie Marlboro spokesman JOHN HOGAN and

McLaren Team Manager and chief mechanic ALASTAIR CALDWELL.

The atmosphere is tense, uncomfortable...

MAYER

I'll come straight to the point. Our

esteemed lead driver...

CALDWELL

Fitti-fucking-paldi..

MAYER

Has ditched us for another team at the

CALDWELL

MAYER

And we need a replacement. Asap.

Thankfully a few hands have already

gone up. Good people...

CALDWELL

Like Jackie Ickx.

JAMES

I'm quicker than Jackie.

MAYER

But he's consistent, dependable.

Sponsor friendly. He'll dress up nice.

Say the right things.

JAMES

What do you want? A driver or a

brushes salesman?

MAYER

We want to be successful.

JAMES

So do I. But I measure that in podium

finishes and beating Niki Lauda not

being a show pony for sponsors.

MAYER

I've heard about this thing with

Lauda.

CALDWELL

(rolls eyes)

Everyone has..

MAYER

You really think you can beat him?

He's World Champion.

JAMES

I beat him in Formula 3.

CALDWELL

This season alone he's had eight

podiums, five wins, you've had what?

HOGAN

One.

JAMES

Only because I've been in the wrong

car. I beat him when the playing field

was level. I'd beat him again in a

McLaren.

right thing. I promise.

He drives in an illegal car and he

calls ME the cheat? Let me tell you:

two weeks before that race in Spain,

we put 20-inch rims on the rear

wheels. We get an extra half second

speed on each lap!! But the Old Man

tells me we can't use those rims, they

make the car too wide. Against the

rules. So we go back to 19-inch rims

making the car slower again. Rules are

rules. For all of us. You're just a

bad loser who can't accept that.

place. You did it because you hoped it

might change you...settle you down...

help with the racing. Not because you

loved me. And who knows, if it had

been just the drinking, or the dope,

or the infidelity, or the moods...it

might even have worked...but when it's

all of them?

No, you're not terrible. You're

wants more.

situation, and how it looks. Having

raided your larder. Plundered your

...James, a few weeks ago, you were

out of the running for this season

completely, now you're right back in

it. What's changed...?

JAMES

A combination of factors, not all of

which I'm prepared to discuss here.

Justice being done re: the

disqualification in Spain helps, and

having my old car back of course...

Mathematically in theory it's now

possible for Hunt to catch you. Are

you worried?

NIKI

Not at all. For him to catch me, he'd

have to win all the remaining races,

and I'd have to lose them. And pigs

would have to fly.

NIKI

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a

private family matter to attend to.

NIKI

Thank you. I called this meeting

because as all drivers know the

Nurburgring is a race track from the

Stone Ages. The most stupid, barbaric,

outdated, dangerous, track in the

world. You've all seen the rain which

has been falling this morning. Those

of you with experience know the Ring

needs perfect conditions to be even

remotely acceptable in terms of risk.

As you can see today is anything BUT

perfect, so I called this meeting to

take a vote to cancel the race.

NIKI

There would be no change to the

situation as far as points is

concerned. The race would simply be

cancelled.

MAYER

This is bullshit...

EDWARDS

If the race is cancelled, none of us

get our race fees...

NIKI

It's true. You leave without your fee,

but you might leave with your LIFE.

VOICE

It also means you would effectively

win the championship.

JAMES

So I can see why this suits you just

fine.

NIKI

Why? There would be no points for me

either...

JAMES

But there would be one race less where

I, or anyone else, could catch you.

BRETT LUNGER

James is right! This is just tactics!

ARTURO MERZARIO

Ferrari's dirty tricks! We've seen it

before!

HARALD ERTL

Maybe it's just that he's frightened?

NIKI

Which asshole said this?

NIKI

Yes, I am frightened. Always a little

bit when I race. I accept every time I

get in my car there is 20% chance that

I could die. But not one per cent

more. And today, with the rain the

risk IS more. How dare you accuse me

of lack of courage? Let me remind you.

I have the track record here. I am the

only person in history to do the Ring

in under 7 minutes. So actually it's

to my ADVANTAGE to race here today.

Because I'm quicker than all of you.

JAMES

Fine. Then let's race!

JAMES

There's a hundred thousand fans out

there who would never forgive us if we

didn't.

MERZARIO

And some of us need our race fees!!

Sure. I had a skin graft operation

where they put half my right thigh in

my face. It doesn't look too good but

one unexpected advantage is it's

impossible to perspire through a skin

graft, so sweat will never run in my

eyes again - which is good for a

driver.

BRAZILIAN JOURNALIST

When they heard about your condition,

Ferrari immediately hired another

driver, Carlos Reutemann.

NIKI

Ja. Before even my first operation.

Is he your replacement now?

No. Just another team-mate. Keen to

going to be responsible for turning

the room again.

CALDWELL

But you have no option. You HAVE to

race, James. It's your only shot. If

you don't, Niki wins..

JAMES

I'm not voting against Niki

again....or forcing fellow drivers to

risk their lives. Sorry. World

Championship or not...

CALDWELL

To let the condensation out.

But it will also let the water in.

Not if you're leading.

Trust me. This race is all about the

start. Whoever's in front will see

everything. Whoever's second...

Good luck.

JAMES

I heard you were spending more and

more time in one of these...

NIKI

Do you fly?

JAMES

No.

NIKI

You should try it. If something goes

wrong up there, you're on the edge,

but have to stay within the rules.

Stick to regulations. Suppress the

ego. It's good discipline for the

racing.

JAMES

And there I was thinking you were

about to wax lyrical about the romance

of flight. I should have known better.

NIKI

What brings you here?

JAMES

A friend's wedding. At least I think

it was a wedding. Might have been a

birthday. All a bit of a blur. How

about you? Been at Fiorano?

NIKI

Pre-season testing.

JAMES

Already? In February? You're

relentless.

NIKI

Thank you.

JAMES

I'm not sure I meant it as a

compliment.

NIKI

But it is one. Relentlessness is good.

Means you're a fighter. That you never

give up. Behind my back I know some of

you guys call me `The Rat.' Because I

look like one. It's meant as an

insult. But I don't mind it. Rats are

ugly, sure. And no one likes them. But

they're intelligent. With a strong

survival instinct.

NIKI

So when do you start testing? Next

week?

JAMES

Are you mad? I didn't just win the

biggest thing of my life so I could

get right back to work.

NIKI

Why? You need to. To prove to all the

people who will always say you only

won it because...

JAMES

Because what...? Because of your

accident? Is that other people, Niki?

Or you? I won. On the all important

day when it came down to it, we raced

on equal terms in equally good cars.

JAMES (contid)

You bottled and I had the guts to see

it through.

NIKI

It's true. You won that race. And

believe me if I had to lose that title

to anyone, I'm happy it was you. But

that doesn't change the fact you have

to win again.

JAMES

Why?

NIKI

Because that's what it means to be a

winner, no? It's a permanent

condition. Never stops or goes away.

It stays with you always.

JAMES

That's winning? Sounds like losing to

me. Some of life needs to be for

pleasure, Niki. What's the use of

having a million cups and medals if

you never have any fun? How is that

winning?

NIKI

You're right. I could learn from you.

In hospital the toughest part of my

treatment was the vacuum. Pumping the

shit out of my lungs. It was agony.

While doing it, I was watching

television...you winning all those

races...and I was cursing you.. "That

bastard, Hunt", I would shout, "I hate

that guy." one day the doctor said,

"Mr. Lauda, may I offer one piece of

advice? Stop thinking of it as a curse

to have been given an enemy in life.

It can be a blessing, too." I said,

"Who are you, Confucius?" He said, "A

wise man gets more from his enemies

than a fool from his friends." And you

know, he's right. Look at us. We were

a pair of kids when we first met.

Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3. Headed

nowhere. Now we're both Champions of

the world. Not bad.

JAMES

No, not bad.

busting my balls. Get back to work.

myself first. And so should you. You

See you on race day, Champ.

NIKI

You will. Champ.
