SECOND DRAFT

"While stands the Colosseum, Rome shall stand.

When falls the Colosseum, Rome shall fall.

And when Rome falls -- the World."

Byron

COMMODUS

Do you think he's really dying?

LUCILLA

He's been dying for ten years.

COMMODUS

I think he's really dying this time.

COMMODUS

He has to be bled every night now.

LUCILLA

How do you know that?

COMMODUS

I've been so informed.

COMMODUS

If he weren't really dying he

wouldn't have sent for us.

LUCILLA

(a smile)

Maybe he just misses us.

COMMODUS

And the Senators.  He wouldn't have

summoned them if --

LUCILLA

Peace, Commodus.  After two weeks on

the road your incessant scheming is

hurting my head.

COMMODUS

The first thing I shall do is honor

him with games worthy of his

majesty.

LUCILLA

The first thing I shall do is have a

hot bath.

COMMODUS

Why have we stopped?

PRAETORIAN GUARD MEMBER

We're here, sir.

COMMODUS

(to Soldier #1)

Where is my father?

SOLDIER #1

He's at the front, sir.

COMMODUS

Is the battle won?

SOLDIER #1

Don't know, sir.  They've been gone

for eight days.

COMMODUS

(to Soldier #1)

My sister wants a bath, take her to

the camp.

(to Soldier #2)

Take me to my father.

LUCILLA

(dry)

Civilization at last.  Gods preserve

us.

TITUS

You would do as well to read the

mind of a rhinoceros.

QUINTUS

These barbarians would rather drown

in blood than yield an inch.  If I

didn't hate them so much I would

admire them.

TITUS

They simply will not surrender.

MAXIMUS

(quietly)

A people should know when they are

conquered.

MAXIMUS

At the first signal release the

catapults.  We'll use the cavalry to

cut off the retreat.

QUINTUS

General, I don't recommend that.

Our cavalry might be caught in the

flames.

MAXIMUS

I hope not, because I'm going to be

leading them.

MAXIMUS

Why don't they know they're already

dead?

QUINTUS

Now!

MAXIMUS

(to his men)

Hold steady... steady...

MAXIMUS

Steady...

MAXIMUS

Brothers -- I salute you!  For Rome!

MAXIMUS

Caesar.

MARCUS

Maximus, you prove your valor again.

Let us hope for the final time here.

MAXIMUS

I don't think there's anyone left to

fight.

MARCUS

There are always people left to

fight...

MARCUS

But this night, at least, Germania

is at last defeated... What will you

do now, my friend?

MAXIMUS

Should Caesar permit, I'll go home.

I've been away too long.  I've

forgotten my wife's face and I

barely know my son.

GERMAN PRISONER

THIS BLOOD MEANS NOTHING, CONQUEROR!

MARCUS

(to Soldier)

Stop...

(to Prisoner)

... You speak our language?

GERMAN PRISONER

You have been in my homeland for

twelve years.  Of course I speak

your language.  So did my son, who

you murdered.  So did my daughter,

who you raped.

MAXIMUS

(to Marcus)

Come, Caesar...

MARCUS

No.  Let him speak...

(to Prisoner)

... I am Rome, what would you say to

me?

GERMAN PRISONER

(points to sunset)

You are that sun, Rome, and your

time is over... You can slit a

thousand throats here, and you can

put a thousand babies to the sword,

but it will always be our home.

MARCUS

Now it is Rome.

GERMAN PRISONER

It will never be Rome.  Not as long

as one German breathes.

MARCUS

No... Release him.  Give him safe

passage.  Let him go to his family.

MARCUS

Tell me again, Maximus, why are we

here?

MAXIMUS

For the glory of the empire, sire.

MARCUS

(quietly)

Yes.  I remember.

MAXIMUS

They honor you, Caesar.

MARCUS

I don't think they're standing for

me, Maximus.  They honor you.

COMMODUS

Have I missed it?

COMMODUS

Have I missed the battle?

MARCUS

You've missed the war.  We're done

here.

COMMODUS

Father.  Congratulations.  I shall

sacrifice a thousand doves to honor

your triumph.

MARCUS

Spare the doves and honor Maximus,

he won the battle.

COMMODUS

General, Rome salutes you and I

embrace you as a brother.

MAXIMUS

Highness.

COMMODUS

Your Spaniards seem invincible.  May

the Gods favor the Felix Regiment

now and always...

(to his father)

Here, Father, take my arm.

MARCUS

(ignores this)

Where's your sister?

COMMODUS

She's at the camp.  She had no

desire to see the gore of the

battlefield.

MARCUS

(smiles)

Lucilla would eat every corpse here

if it brought her one step closer to

the throne.

MAXIMUS

(smiles)

Caesar, you do the lady injustice.

MARCUS

It's a foolish old cobra who doesn't

recognize his own off-spring...

(he suddenly stops,

not feeling well)

I think... I should ride now.

MARCUS

So much for the glory of Rome.

COMMODUS

(neutral)

He's dying.

COMMODUS

Poor old man.

MAXIMUS

(terse)

If you'll excuse me, Highness.

MAXIMUS

What, Gallus, losing your other

hand?

GALLUS

Aye, General, they're going to make

a bronze one for it.  Long fingers

this time.

MAXIMUS

And the women of your village will

crave your touch even more.

GALLUS

Ah, then you know the women of my

village.

MAXIMUS

What's your name, son?

VALERIUS

Valerius, General.

MAXIMUS

The name suits you.

VALERIUS

Why am I dying?

MAXIMUS

You're dying because you love Rome,

as I do.

VALERIUS

I've never been to Rome.

MAXIMUS

Neither have I.  Rome for us lives

here...

(he touches his

heart)

... it's a thing inside us that came

from our ancestors and that we give

to our children.

VALERIUS

It must be glorious, Rome.  I've

only seen pictures.  Is it a

glorious place?

MAXIMUS

Yes, it's a glorious place.

VALERIUS

It must be.

FALCO

Hail, Marcus Aurelius.

MARCUS

Stand up, Senators.  That unfamiliar

posture doesn't suit you.

GAIUS

We live in supplication to your

glory.

MARCUS

All the while conspiring with that

fat man in Rome.  How is the old

monster?

GAIUS

Senator Gracchus is hale, sire.

MARCUS

Still damning me to the four winds?

GAIUS

Still eager for your triumphant

return to Rome, Caesar.

MARCUS

I would have silenced him decades

ago -- but I just like him too much.

MAXIMUS

(to Titus)

If you want to stay on, I support

you.  So do the men.  I'll ask the

Emperor to appoint you in my place.

TITUS

It won't be the Felix Regiment

without you.

MAXIMUS

I'll return after a season at home.

Maybe two.

QUINTUS

That means after three or four more

babies.

TITUS

And you'll be too fat from Vibia's

cooking to get on your horse by

then.

MAXIMUS

Should the Gods so bless me.  I

would be thankful.

COMMODUS

Hail, warriors.  My congratulations.

TITUS AND QUINTUS

(bowing)

Highness.

COMMODUS

(to Maximus)

My old friend, my father tells me

you're returning to Spain?

MAXIMUS

Yes.

COMMODUS

A pity.  I'll need men like you in

my army...

COMMODUS

There are larger division that might

appeal to you.  Even the Praetorian

Guard.  You've never been to Rome.

Imagine arriving as head of the

Praetorians!  They have really

splendid uniforms.

MAXIMUS

(cold)

I'm going home.

GAIUS

(to Maximus)

... And why not apply for entry to

the Senate?

FALCO

A war hero with a handsome face and

a strong heart could go far.

COMMODUS

General Maximus, may I present

Senators Gaius and Falco.  Beware of

this Gaius, he'll pour a honeyed

potion in your ear and you'll wake

up one day and all you'll say is

"Republic, Republic, Republic..."

FALCO

Have you never considered Rome?

MAXIMUS

No.

COMMODUS

You've had my ear since we were

children.  You could be a valuable

ally in the Senate.

GAIUS

Are you a believer in Republicanism?

COMMODUS

(laughs)

There -- I warned you.

MAXIMUS

I'm a soldier, not a politician.

GAIUS

If your heart lies with the people,

I would back you for the Senate.

I'm sure Gracchus would as well.

COMMODUS

Not a word about that sodomite

bastard.

GAIUS

(smiles to Maximus)

The august Senator Gracchus has been

rather a gadfly on the flesh of the

imperial family.

FALCO

He's a damned provocateur.

GAIUS

He lives under the antiquated

assumption that the Senate should

represent the people with vigor.

COMMODUS

I won't tolerate it.  His incessant

criticism exhausts me.  The man can

speak for five hours without taking

a breath.

GAIUS

He serves Rome best when he serves

it with honesty.

COMMODUS

(sharply)

Enough... Maximus, I would like to

inspect the Felix Regiment at dawn.

Please arrange it.

MAXIMUS

I can't do that.

COMMODUS

Excuse me?

MAXIMUS

My men have been fighting for five

solid days.  They're too busy dying

to go on dress parade.

COMMODUS

(smiles)

Of course, how foolish of me.  Some

other time...

COMMODUS

Caesar retires early tonight.

MARCUS

If only you had been born a man...

LUCILLA

Father.

MARCUS

What a Caesar you would have made.

LUCILLA

You're right.

MARCUS

I think you would have been strong.

I wonder if you would have been

just?

LUCILLA

I would have been what you taught me

to be.

MARCUS

Well, pretend to be my loving

daughter tonight and walk with me to

my chamber.

MARCUS

This is a pleasant fiction, isn't

it?

MAXIMUS

(bows)

Caesar.

MARCUS

Read this.

MAXIMUS

I never acquired the art, sir.

MARCUS

Of course.  No matter.  In this

letter I denote my intention to

nominate you to stand for the

Emperorship after my death.

MARCUS

My son is not a moral man.  You have

known this since you were young.  He

cannot rule.

MAXIMUS

Caesar, I am honored but --

MARCUS

For twenty years I have been

spilling blood.  For twenty years I

have written philosophy and

ruminated and conquered.  Since I

became Caesar I have only had four

years without war.  Four years of

peace in twenty.  So perhaps I can

be... forgiven.

MARCUS

While I have been fighting, Rome has

grown mad and corpulent and

diseased.  I did this.  And now I

shall make it right.

MAXIMUS

Sire, you brought the light of the

Gods to barbarian darkness.  You

brought civilization and justice to

the farthest --

MARCUS

(fierce)

I have brought the sword -- nothing

more!  Rome is far away and we

shouldn't be here.  What matter is

it to the Gods if we subdue one more

tribe of Parthians or Gauls?  What

matter is it to Rome if a thousand

more barbarians bend to our lash?

MARCUS

Winter, Maximus.  It's winter now...

MARCUS

There was a dream that was Rome.  I

can only whisper of it now.

Anything more than a whisper and the

dream vanishes.  It's so... fragile.

The true glory of Rome is in a very

fragile idea.  Imagine a place

devoted to the rights of the

citizen.  Where every free man has a

voice.  That was the dream... And I

fear it will not survive the winter.

MARCUS

Let's just whisper here, you and I.

MAXIMUS

Yes, Caesar.

MARCUS

If the dream is ever to live again

the people must have a true voice.

The voice I took from them.  That

all the Caesars took from them, bit

by bit, conquest by conquest.  And

now that I am dying I am going to

give them that voice again.

MAXIMUS

You're not dying.

MARCUS

I am, Maximus.  It's strange... I

find as I near the end I think

little of the waning moments around

me... instead I think much of the

past... and of the future.  How will

the world speak my name in years to

come?  Will I be known as the

philosopher?  The warrior?  The

tyrant?  Or will there be a more

golden sounding to my name?  Will I

be the Emperor who gave Rome back

her freedom?

MARCUS

Before I die I will give the people

this final gift.  I will give them

the Senate reborn.  The voice of the

people empowered again, as it was

always meant to be.  It is my design

that they will elect the next

Emperor.  And I would put forward

your name with my backing.

MAXIMUS

Caesar, you do me honor -- but your

son has pride of place for

succession.

MARCUS

You are the son I should have had...

Although I fear in my deepest heart

that if you had truly been my son my

blood would have polluted you as it

did Commodus.  We're a cursed

bloodline.  We have lived so long in

power and depravity that we no

longer remember a life without it.

We can no longer even imagine a life

without it.

MARCUS

Look at me, son.

MARCUS

Son... I know that one grove of your

vineyard is worth more to you than

all the treasures of Rome.  I know

one loving word from your wife is

worth more than the accolades of an

Empire.  But... a fond old man, who

loves you more than he can say, begs

you to at least think about what he

has said tonight.

MAXIMUS

I shall, Caesar.

MARCUS

I'll keep this letter to myself.  I

hope that with the sunrise you will

agree.  And embrace me as a father.

MAXIMUS

You have always been my father.

LUCILLA'S VOICE

He always favored you...

LUCILLA

Even over his son.

MAXIMUS

(turning away)

That's not true.

LUCILLA

Maximus, stop...

(he stops)

Let me see your face.

LUCILLA

You've been crying.

MAXIMUS

I lost too many men.

LUCILLA

What does my father intend?

MAXIMUS

I don't know.

LUCILLA

You're lying.  I could tell when you

were lying even when we were

children.  You hate it.

MAXIMUS

I never acquired your comfort with

it.

LUCILLA

True.  But then you never had to.

Maximus, stop...

(he stops again)

... Is it really so terrible seeing

me again?

MAXIMUS

No.  I'm sorry.  I'm tired from the

battle.

LUCILLA

And you are hurt to see my father

dying.

LUCILLA

He will announce Commodus'

succession.  That's why he summoned

us.  Will you serve my brother as

you served his father?

MAXIMUS

I will always serve the ideals of

Rome.

LUCILLA

Do you know I still remember you in

my prayers...?  Oh yes, I pray...

Ever since that day you saved me

from drowning off Capri.  Do you

remember?

MAXIMUS

Yes.

LUCILLA

Commodus was so angry that a mere

peasant -- a Spaniard no less --

touched the royal person, do you

remember his anger?

MAXIMUS

Yes.

LUCILLA

Mark this, Maximus:  that is the man

who will be Emperor.

MAXIMUS

May I be permitted to go, Highness?

LUCILLA

There was a time when you didn't

call me "Highness."

MAXIMUS

And there was a time when you were

just a little girl drowning in the

sea.  All that was a different life.

LUCILLA

(quietly)

Very different... I wonder if it was

better?

MAXIMUS

It was more honest.

MAXIMUS

I thank you for your prayers.

MAXIMUS

Ancestors, true bloodline, I ask you

for your guidance.  Bring me your

solace and your wisdom.  Blessed

Mother, come to me in my dreams with

the Gods' desire for my future.

Blessed Father, watch over my wife

and my son with a ready sword.  Keep

them safe until my return.  Whisper

to them in their sleep that I live

only to hold them again and all else

is dust and air.  Ancestors, true

bloodline, I honor you and will try

to live with the dignity you have

taught me.

COMMODUS

(quietly)

I search the faces of the Gods for

ways to please you... to make you

proud... and I can never do it.  One

kind word -- one full hug where you

pressed me to your chest and held me

tight -- would have been like the

sun on my heart for a thousand

years... What is it in me you hate

so much?  My eyes are your eyes.  My

hands are your hands.  All I have

ever wanted was to live up to you.

Caesar.  Father.

COMMODUS

Why does Maximus deserve what I

could never have? -- Why do you love

his eyes over mine? -- I would

butcher the whole world -- if you

would only love me...

QUINTUS

General -- Maximus --

MAXIMUS

Quintus -- ?

QUINTUS

The Emperor needs you.  It's urgent.

MAXIMUS

What is it?  Is he ill?

QUINTUS

I don't know...

COMMODUS

Lament with me, brother, our great

father is dead.  I want --

COMMODUS

General, the Gods' have taken the

great man and left me alone.  My

first desire as Emperor is that you

take my hand in friendship.  I need

you at my side, Maximus, at this

moment above all others.  Stand with

me.

MAXIMUS

How did he die?

MAXIMUS

How did he die?

COMMODUS

The surgeons say it was his breath

that gave out.

COMMODUS

Take my hand, Maximus.  I only offer

it once.

MAXIMUS

How will the world speak your name

now, old man?

LUCILLA

Hail, Caesar.

MAXIMUS

What -- ?!

QUINTUS

(ashamed)

Please don't fight, Maximus --

MAXIMUS

Quintus --

QUINTUS

I'm sorry, General, Caesar has

spoken.

MAXIMUS

Quintus, what -- ?

QUINTUS

(anguish)

I have no choice --

MAXIMUS

(suddenly)

My family?!

MAXIMUS

What about my family, Quintus?

QUINTUS

(quietly)

They will greet you in the

afterlife.

QUINTUS

(quietly, to

assassins)

Take him as far as the sunrise and

then kill him.

ASSASSIN #1

All right, this is far enough.

ASSASSIN #1

You two take him down there where no

one will find him.

ASSASSIN #3

Come on, General...

MAXIMUS

Have you ever done this before?

ASSASSIN #3

What?

MAXIMUS

Killed a man with a sword?

ASSASSIN #3

Not like this, exactly... this is

good, you can stop.

MAXIMUS

It can be very messy -- you could

get blood all over your armor.  You

don't want to hack me up now.  You

want one clean stroke.

ASSASSIN #3

Would you kneel, General?

MAXIMUS

One good stroke -- you do know

where, don't you?

ASSASSIN #4

Be quiet.

MAXIMUS

If you miss the spot there'll be

blood everywhere.  Quite a spray.

ASSASSINS #3

All right, where?

MAXIMUS

Here -- you don't want to hit the

vein on the neck --

MAXIMUS

Put the point of your sword here...

you want one, good blow right at

this spot --

COMMODUS

Even as the Gods curse this dark day

with clouds, so too does the sun

begin to shine forth on a promised

tomorrow.  Even as we mourn the

passing of our father, so too do we

celebrate the coming of a bright,

new age for Rome.  At my side,

brothers, you shall pull fresh

glories from the heavens.  At my

side, brothers, you shall know the

adoration of the Gods.  Doubly-dark

is this day because my friend, your

noble commander Maximus Meridas, has

been called to Rome to deal with

urgent matters of state...

COMMODUS

Until his promised return I

appointed Quintus Domitian to serve

in his stead.  I salute you,

Legionnaires!

QUINTUS

(raising his sword)

Hail, Caesar!

FELIX REGIMENT

Hail, Caesar!

TITUS

Quintus, what is -- ?

QUINTUS

(firmly)

Don't speak of it.  Never speak of

it.

MAXIMUS' SON

MOTHER!  MOTHER!  FATHER'S HOME!

MAXIMUS

(weakly)

Am I in Hades?

JUBA

Yes.

JUBA

For your wound...

JUBA

(nods)

For your wound.

JUBA

If you die in the wagons they feed

you to the lions... The lions are

worth more than we are.  I think we

are worth more than the zebras

though.  So they don't feed us to

them.

JUBA

I'm not sure about the giraffe.

SLAVE TRADER

Proximo, my old friend, see what I

have for you today -- !

PROXIMO

Those giraffes you sold me won't

mate!  All they do is run around not

mating!  YOU SOLD ME EUNUCH

GIRAFFES!!

SLAVE TRADER

I will make it up to you, Master.

It's bargain day for you!  Look,

look, look -- I have two lions and a

panther -- hear how they roar for

you!  "Bring me home, Proximo!"

PROXIMO

How much for the lot?

SLAVE TRADER

For you -- 8,000 sesterces.

PROXIMO

For me -- 6,000 sesterces and I want

to see their balls first.  And you

throw in those two slaves.

SLAVE TRADER

(moves to Maximus)

What about this one?  Look at the

arms!

PROXIMO

Good teeth --

PROXIMO

Where did you get those scars?

PROXIMO

Are you a soldier?

PROXIMO

Do you speak? --

(he roars back to a

slave)

KEEP THOSE DAMN FLIES OFF ME!

(back to Maximus)

He's dying.

SLAVE TRADER

1,000 sesterces.

PROXIMO

My ass...

(moves to Juba)

You throw in this one and we'll make

it 7,000 sesterces for the whole

lot.

SLAVE TRADER

I have to eat, Master!  He's my

finest, I couldn't let him go as

part of the lot for less than 9,000

total...

(back to Maximus)

I tell you this one is prime.  He's

a Spaniard and killed fourteen of my

men before he could be subdued!

PROXIMO

(to trader)

All right, let's see.

PROXIMO

(to Slave Trader)

That's enough.

SLAVE TRADER

STOP!  STOP!

PROXIMO

I'll give you 500 sesterces.

SLAVE TRADER

No -- no -- 1,000!

PROXIMO

(laughs)

Come, don't quibble with your old

friend.  I'll take the lions, the

panther, the Numidian and this one

for 7,000.  And I'll buy you the

best whore in the town for two

nights.  She's an enormous mountain

of flesh who craves a stern hand.

SLAVE TRADER

How could I say no to my old friend

Proximo?

PROXIMO

COME ON, YOU FILTHY BEAST!

PROXIMO

Slaves.  I am Proximo, trainer of

gladiators.  You live and die at my

pleasure.  Fight well and you will

live.  Fight poorly and you will

die.  It is better to live.

PROXIMO

Here you will be trained in the art

of combat.  Here you will be given

the tools to survive.  Please my

patrons in the arena and all the

gifts of the world will be showered

upon you.  Imagine riches beyond

your paltry dreams of riches!

Imagine fame beyond your rude

understanding of the word!  All this

can belong to the select few who

prove their worth in the arena.

PROXIMO

If... on the other hand... you

disappoint me... you will be

dismembered and fed to my jackals

limb by limb.

PROXIMO

And my jackals are always hungry.

JUBA

Have you killed a man before?

JUBA

You should eat.  You'll need your

strength tomorrow.

JUBA

I've never killed a man.  But I

think you have.

JUBA

I almost killed once.  The Romans

destroyed my village.  I was with a

hunting party and when we

returned... I would have killed

every Roman in the world.

JUBA

If you don't eat you will die.

JUBA

In the village I come from there was

a man once.  He went fishing one day

and his boat was attacked by

crocodiles.  One of them ate his

leg.  He pulled himself to the shore

and a lion attacked him.  It ate one

of his arms.  He dragged himself

through the desert on the way home

and a scorpion stung his eye.  So he

only had one eye.  When he reached

the village I sat with him.  I said,

"You have lost a leg, an arm and one

eye.  You must have a mighty will to

live."  He said, "No, Lord, it's

just better than the alternative."

JUBA

Life is a gift from our fathers to

us.  Who are you to give it up for

lack of lifting a spoon?

SCRIBE

I know nothing of armaments and

warfare!  I'm a scribe -- I write

down words!  I can write down seven

languages --

VIBIUS

Be still.

SCRIBE

I don't -- how do you hold the

sword?!  I've never held a sword!

VIBIUS

You point the sharp end at your

opponent and you shove it in his

guts.

SCRIBE

I can't -- I --

VIBIUS

(calling to Proximo)

Proximo!  You insult me with this

carrion!  Chain him to someone else!

PROXIMO

(calling back)

Don't worry, noble Vibius, he won't

be bothering you for long.

CHILDREN

Dead guts!  Dead guts!  Dead guts!

PROXIMO

Some of you say you can't fight, you

won't fight... They all say that...

But one day you will pick up a sword

and thrust it into another man.  And

the crowd will cheer you and love

you.  And you will love them for it.

On that day... you will be a

gladiator.

PROXIMO

In this life, we all die.  All we

can choose is how we die.  And how

we are remembered.  Be remembered

proudly.

PROXIMO

No...

(he points to Juba)

... give the Spaniard to him.  Give

the Scribe to Vibius.

JUBA

(to Maximus)

Are we going to fight each other?

PROXIMO

Make it 600 sesterces for each

decapitation.

TRAINER #1

How many strokes?

PROXIMO

Two.

TRAINER #1

For the great Vibius, one stroke.

PROXIMO

Done.  400 sesterces for two

strokes.

TRAINER #1

(re: Vibius)

Who's he with?

PROXIMO

A Greek Scribe.

TRAINER #1

I'll raise the wager.

PROXIMO

(smiles)

Give me odds, friend.

GRACCHUS

We have plague in the Hebrew Quarter

and it is spreading... we have

looting at the granaries... we have

so much filth in the Tiber that the

water is undrinkable... we have

Praetorian Guard units that are

demanding protection payments from

the merchants at the exchange --

MARCELLUS

My City Guard units have tried to

curtail these excesses but no

constabulary can police the entire

city.  And the Praetorians outnumber

us two to one.

GRACCHUS

Rome dies as the Emperor plays at

beneficence.  At least Nero gave us

music!

GAIUS

Do you think he'll listen to us?

GRACCHUS

It is his duty to hear the will of

the Senate.

GRACCHUS

Not to mention the damn traffic!

CHILD

We honor Caesar with the laurel to

show our love and appreciation for

his benevolence.

COMMODUS

Caesar is honored to accept your

tribute, Citizen Scholar.

COMMODUS

(to all)

It is the most sacred duty of the

Emperor to oversee the education of

the young.  If I could leave no

other legacy than the scholarship of

all children my life would be

blessed.  Tutors, you hold the

future of Rome in your hands.  Teach

them well so that they will bring

honor to the Empire.  I salute you.

COMMODUS

Look at them, Senators... my truest

gift to Rome.

GRACCHUS

Darling children, to be sure, now if

I may proceed?

COMMODUS

(sighs)

Very well...

GRACCHUS

Caesar, your presence in Rome is an

invaluable opportunity to begin

correcting some of the ills that

have beset the city since your

father went to the wars.  We would

like to --

COMMODUS

Peace, good Gracchus, peace...

COMMODUS

My beloved father was a careless

shepherd to his flock.  I shall be a

good father to my children.  I shall

remain in Rome and show them how

they are loved.

GRACCHUS

With respect, sire, the people don't

need love -- they need law.  The

Senate has prepared a series of

protocols to begin addressing the

corruption in the city --

(Gaius hands him a

scroll)

-- starting with basic sanitation in

the Hebrew Quarter.  If Caesar could

study this and --

COMMODUS

You see that's the very problem,

isn't it, my old, old friend?  My

father spent all his time at study.

At books and learning and

philosophy...

COMMODUS

He spent his twilight hours reading

scrolls from the Senate.  All the

while, the people were forgotten.

GRACCHUS

The Senate is the people.

COMMODUS

I doubt many of the people eat so

well as you do, Senator Gracchus...

COMMODUS

I doubt many of the people have such

splendid armor, Captain Marcellus.

Or such fine mistresses, Senator

Gaius.  No... only their true father

knows what the people need.  I shall

show them they are loved.  I shall

hold them to my bosom and embrace

them tightly --

GRACCHUS

Have you ever embraced someone dying

of plague, sire?

COMMODUS

No.  But if you interrupt me one

more time I assure you that you

shall.  I will emulate the immortal

Caesars of the past.  I will give

the people what they truly want.

Starting this day I will draw all of

Rome to the Colosseum.  I will give

them bread.  And they will want

nothing more.

GRACCHUS

You want to hold games?

COMMODUS

Not just any games, Senator!  A

series of games that will make the

Gods envious and leave my children

happy!  I will subsidize the arena

from this day forth -- and I will

culminate this celebration in a

great spectacle the likes of which

the world has never seen!  A great

spectacle to honor my father!

Magnificent, unending weeks of

festivity all in the name of Marcus

Aurelius!

GRACCHUS

If I may, Caesar... how are you

going to pay for this?

COMMODUS

That is not your concern.

GRACCHUS

Respectfully, sire, taxation and

import duties are the exclusive

province of the Senate --

COMMODUS

MY FATHER DESERVES TO BE HONORED AND

I WILL HONOR HIM! -- AND THE PEOPLE

WILL LOVE ME! -- AND THE SENATE WILL

OBEY ME OR EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL

BURN!  BURN!  BURN! -- I WILL HAVE

ORDER!

LUCILLA

Gentlemen, in the future do not

concern my brother with these

matters.  Come to me.

MARCELLUS

Games?  He wants to hold games?

GAIUS

It's madness.

GRACCHUS

No... it's not...

GRACCHUS

He knows who Rome is.  Rome is the

mob.  He will conjure magic for them

and they will be distracted.  And he

will takes their lives.  And he will

take their freedom.  And still they

will roar.  The beating heart of

Rome isn't the marble of the Senate.

It's the sand of the Colosseum.  He

will give them death.  And they will

love him for it.

PROXIMO

(quickly)

I've wagered on you against the

Celts -- ignore the others and go

for them -- there are two axe-and-

net and two long spear.  Now the

Celts aren't used to the sun so you

have the advantage there...

PROXIMO

And keep them moving, their lungs

aren't strong, ground the spears as

soon as you can and then go for the

ax-men.  If you get all four there's

an extra bonus so don't be

distracted by the Spartans...

VIBIUS

MOVE ASIDE!  THIS IS A TABLE FOR

MEN!

PROXIMO

(holding up a plate)

Butterfly?

PROXIMO

Perhaps you'd like a woman?

PROXIMO

Boy?

PROXIMO

Gold?

PROXIMO

Well, I have nothing left to offer

you!  A man who turns down a

butterfly, a woman, a boy and gold

confuses me.  Personally, I'd grab

them all and then grab some more

because the Gods are fanciful and

take us at their whim.  Does the

Spaniard have any needs?

PROXIMO

You fight like a soldier.  You have

wounds like a soldier who has been

on long campaigns.  You eye the

world around you like an enemy.

What is your name, Roman soldier?

MAXIMUS

Gladiator.

PROXIMO

And nothing more?

MAXIMUS

Nothing more.

PROXIMO

In two days we leave for Rome.

PROXIMO

Ah... so it's Rome you want.  Well

you shall have her, Gladiator.  The

new Emperor has ordered a series of

matches to culminate in a grand

spectacle.  If you do well I shall

become very, very rich.  If you do

well enough I shall set you free.

Is it freedom you want?

PROXIMO

(quietly)

Not even that.

MAXIMUS

(barely controlled)

The Emperor -- will he be there?

PROXIMO

Oh yes.  He's apparently quite mad

about the games.  Spending a

fortune, which is, needless to say,

good for me again.  But what is good

for you, Gladiator?

MAXIMUS

Have you -- how does one meet the

Emperor?

PROXIMO

As a gladiator?

MAXIMUS

Yes.

PROXIMO

One doesn't.

PROXIMO

Except... If one has proven oneself

in battle.  If at the end of the

games you are the final man standing

-- the Emperor will present you with

a small wooden sword.  The sword is

your freedom.

MAXIMUS

He give it personally?

PROXIMO

He did to me...

(Maximus is surprised

at this)

Our great father Marcus Aurelius

looked into my eyes and touched me

on the shoulder.

MAXIMUS

You knew Marcus?

PROXIMO

I didn't know him.  He touched me on

the shoulder.  Just once.  But that

was enough.

PROXIMO

All right, Gladiator.  We shall go

to Rome together and have bloody

adventures.  The Great Whore will

suckle us until we are fat and happy

and can't suck another drop.  That

is Rome.

COMMODUS

All my desires are splitting my head

to pieces -- there's so much I want

to do -- but all my efforts to show

my children they are loved go

unappreciated by those dragons in

the Senate --

LUCILLA

(mixing tonic)

Quiet, brother...

LUCILLA

Leave the Senate to me.  Don't

trouble yourself.

COMMODUS

All I want is to be a good father to

my people.  Why don't they

understand that?

LUCILLA

Shhh.  The tonic will help...

LUCILLA

Yes, just drink this down.

COMMODUS

I must take a firmer hand with them.

They must know their father can be

firm.  As our father was firm with

us.

LUCILLA

Our father lost his way.  His

mistake was believing the old songs

of the "Republic."  We know better.

So let the Senate talk.  They have

no real power.

COMMODUS

Yes... yes... you always know the

way.  You were always so wise in

these matters...

(he takes her hand)

You know if I didn't have my duty to

Rome I think I should be an artist.

I should go away and paint pictures

of the sea and leave all the

politics to you...

COMMODUS

Will you stay with me?

LUCILLA

(smiles gently)

Still afraid of the dark, brother?

COMMODUS

Still.  Always.

COMMODUS

My dreams would terrify the world.

LUCILLA

I'll stay with you until you are

asleep.

COMMODUS

(falling asleep)

And after... just sit with me.  Keep

me safe...

LUCILLA

He's asleep.  Be quick.

GRACCHUS

We've taking a sounding, the Senate

is with us.

LUCILLA

Good.

GRACCHUS

But we are only words.  We are air.

We need steel.

MARCELLUS

The City Guard is faithful to the

Republic.  But we don't stand a

chance against the Praetorians.

LUCILLA

Can they be bought?

MARCELLUS

They are zealots -- totally

committed to your brother.

GRACCHUS

Well, can they at least be rented

for a day?

MARCELLUS

I doubt it.  He pays them exorbitant

salaries and lets them loot and

extort as they see fit.  The city

belongs to them.

LUCILLA

And they've started arresting

scholars now.  Anyone who dares

speak out -- even satirists and

chroniclers.

MARCELLUS

And mathematicians and Christians.

All to fill the arena.

GAIUS

And what pays for it?  These games

are costing a fortune and yet we

have no new taxes.

LUCILLA

The future.  The future pays for

it...

LUCILLA

He's started selling the grain

reserves.

GAIUS

No.

MARCELLUS

That can't be true...

LUCILLA

He's selling Rome's reserves of

grain.  The people will be starving

in two years.  I hope they are

enjoying the spectacles because soon

enough they will be dead because of

them.

MARCELLUS

Rome must know this.

LUCILLA

And who will tell them?!  You,

Marcellus?  You, Senator Gaius?

Will you make a speech on the Senate

floor denouncing my brother?  And

then see your family in the

Colosseum?  What town-crier would

dare?

LUCILLA

He must die.

GAIUS

The Praetorians would only seize

control themselves.

LUCILLA

No -- cut off the head and the snake

cannot strike.

GRACCHUS

Lucilla, Gaius is right.  Until the

City Guard can neutralize the

Praetorians we can accomplish

nothing.

MARCELLUS

And I haven't enough men.

LUCILLA

What about the army?

GAIUS

No Roman army has entered the

capital in a hundred years.

LUCILLA

So we do nothing?!

LUCIUS' VOICE

Mother...

LUCIUS

I heard voices...

LUCILLA

(going to him)

It's all right, darling, you --

LUCIUS

(running to Gracchus)

Senator!  What did you bring me?!

GRACCHUS

For you prince Lucius... a sea

monster!

GRACCHUS

Off the coast of Achaea they grow

twenty times this size, with

snapping teeth to devour any nasty

Praetorians they come across... now,

where is Achaea?

LUCIUS

Below Macedonia!

GRACCHUS

Show me on the map.

LUCILLA

Lucius, you go in now, I'll be in

shortly.

LUCIUS

(to Gracchus)

Thank you, Senator Mountain!

GRACCHUS

You're welcome, Prince Anthill!

LUCILLA

What are you going to do?

GRACCHUS

Peace child... One dark night the

Gods will light our path.  They will

give us the voice we need.  Have

faith in that.  Have faith.

VIBIUS

Not what you expected?

MAXIMUS

No.

VIBIUS

Rome is nothing but a slaughter

house.  And we are the meat.

VIBIUS

Tradition.  He watches over us.

VIBIUS

(to Maximus)

Oh go on, it won't kill you.

PROXIMO

(calling to them)

Stop that!  You'll get some

monstrous disease and then you'll be

worth nothing to me!

JUBA

Do you think it will be much

different?  Here in Rome?

MAXIMUS

Bigger arena.  Same killing.

JUBA

Are you scared for tomorrow?

MAXIMUS

No.

JUBA

Me too.

JUBA

I never though it would be so easy

to kill.

JUBA

So you're finally home.

MAXIMUS

This isn't my home.

JUBA

For all Romans... this is home.

JUBA

(quietly)

Among my people we honor the soil of

our home.  Our ancestors are in that

soil.  All their dreams live there.

I will never see my home again.  The

soil is dead and no one honors them,

so the dreams die.

MAXIMUS

Perhaps one day you'll return.

JUBA

How can I go back?  I am not what I

was.  When a man kills for no

reason, he has lost himself.

CASSIUS

... and the Emperor will have no

more animal battles today --

TRAINER #1

You promised me a bear match,

Cassius!

TRAINER #2

I have ten damned gorillas!  You

said gorillas yesterday!

CASSIUS

Talk to the man in the imperial box.

Who has the next slot...?

(he checks the

boards)

-- Lentulus, Gideon, Trebonius and

Proximo --

(to Proximo)

-- Nice to have you back, you

piratical bastard -- now listen, the

Emperor wants the Carthage

spectacle.

PROXIMO

No -- have pity, Cassius -- !

TRAINER #3

My men are too good for -- !

CASSIUS

You give us the Carthage match or

lose your spot on the rotation --

but don't worry -- gold is flowing

from the Emperor's fingers.

TRAINER #3

It'll cost you --

PROXIMO

I won't do it for less than 100,000

sesterces -- !

TRAINER #4

120,000!  All I have is my best

Thracians!

CASSIUS

(to Proximo)

And I want to see this famous

Spaniard of yours -- his reputation

soars from the provinces.  The

people are eager for him --

PROXIMO

I won't throw my Spaniard into a

spectacle!  Damn you and damn the

rotation!

CASSIUS

You will and the price will be

90,000 sesterces each --

(to all)

-- which you all know is exorbitant

-- AND IF YOU EXTORTING BLOOD-WHORES

TRY TO PAWN OFF LESSER FIGHTERS ON

ME I WILL SEE YOU DEAD IN THE ARENA

TOMORROW!

TRAINER #4

My Thracians are worth -- !

CASSIUS

Give me your best, brothers.  They

die before Caesar.

PROXIMO

I give you 30,000 my Spaniard will

kill at least one of your Thracians.

TRAINER #4

30,000?!  On a Spaniard?!  That

provincial sun has curdled your

brain!

PROXIMO

Then make the wager, you smug

bastard!

PROXIMO

All right -- there are three other

teams, four men each --

(to Maximus)

You know what a Thracian looks like?

MAXIMUS

Yes, but --

PROXIMO

Ignore the others -- go for the

Thracians.  The sun is to the east

-- over the gate -- keep your back

to the gate and you won't have the

sun.

MAXIMUS

What -- ?

PROXIMO

Hurry -- !

PROXIMO

Die well and we'll sing songs about

you for a generation.

CASSIUS

This day we reach back to hallowed

antiquity to bring you... THE FALL

OF MIGHTY CARTHAGE...!

(the crowd cheers)

... On the barren armies of the

barbarian Hannibal!  Ferocious

mercenaries and warriors of all

brute nations bent on merciless

conquest!  Your Emperor is pleased

to give you... THE BARBARIAN HORDE!

CASSIUS

But on that illustrious day the Gods

sent against them Rome's greatest

warriors...!  The very life-image of

nobility and glorious valor... who

would on this day, and on these same

arid Numidian deserts, decide THE

FATE OF THE EMPIRE... Your Emperor

is pleased to give you... THE

LEGIONNAIRES OF SCIPIO AFRICANUS!!

COMMODUS

Slave!  Who are you?

COMMODUS

SLAVE!  WHO ARE YOU?

COMMODUS

SLAVE!  WHO ARE YOU?!

MAXIMUS

I AM MAXIMUS MERIDAS, GENERAL OF THE

FELIX REGIMENT OF THE ROMAN ARMY AND

SERVANT TO THE EMPEROR MARCUS

AURELIUS!

MAXIMUS

I AM FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND

HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE AND

LANDLORD TO A MURDERED WORLD -- AND

I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE!

COMMODUS

Why is he still alive?

LUCILLA

I don't know.

COMMODUS

He shouldn't be alive.  That vexes

me.  I am terribly vexed...

COMMODUS

There, that's better.  Do you like

the platform here?

LUCILLA

Mmm.

COMMODUS

I do too.  Simple, elegant...

COMMODUS

Father would have wanted something

more ornate but he's dead now.

COMMODUS

Maximus Meridas haunts me.  I see

Father turning away from me and

gazing at him.  How many times did I

suffer that indignity, I wonder?

LUCILLA

What are you going to do?

COMMODUS

I'm going to kill him.

LUCILLA

Good.

COMMODUS

(glances at her)

Oh, you're too clever, Sister.

Don't tell me part of you won't weep

for him.

LUCILLA

When he defies my brother the

Emperor, he defies me.  But you

shouldn't send assassins.

COMMODUS

No?

LUCILLA

The people embraced him today.  They

will be expecting his next match...

(she kneels next to

him)

... let him die in the arena like

the slave he is.  Let the people see

what comes of defying Caesar.

COMMODUS

He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

Long ago.

COMMODUS

Nonetheless, your political acumen

is, as always, unerring.

JUBA

(also standing)

I will fight with you.

MAXIMUS

This isn't your battle.

JUBA

Better to die for a friend than to

die for gold.

PROXIMO

Enjoy yourself, Madame...

(he glances to

Maximus)

General, perform well and there will

be riches for you.

LUCILLA

Rich matrons pay well to be

pleasured by the bravest champions.

MAXIMUS

I knew your brother would send

assassins.  I didn't think he would

send his best.

LUCILLA

Maximus, listen to me --

MAXIMUS

My family were crucified and burnt

while they were still alive.

LUCILLA

I knew nothing of that.

MAXIMUS

(low)

Don't lie to me.

LUCILLA

I wept for them.

MAXIMUS

Don't.

LUCILLA

Do you know what it is to be the

daughter of the Emperor?  I learned

on the night my father had my

husband killed.  I loved my husband

very much.  Very... simply.  He was

a man who believed in the Republic.

He was a man who thought Marcus

should be tending to Rome and not

conquering the world.  One night my

father had him strangled for

conspiring with the Senate.  My

father never spoke of it.  I never

spoke of it.  That is what it is to

be the daughter of Rome.

LUCILLA

My son will live.  He will survive

this cursed bloodline.  Rome will

die and the jackals will pick her

clean -- but my son will survive.

Empires come and go.  Cities crumble

to dust.  Only family matters.

MAXIMUS

My son was innocent.

LUCILLA

So is mine.

MAXIMUS

I want your brother dead.

LUCILLA

So do I.

LUCILLA

My son will never be safe while he

lives.

MAXIMUS

How do you plan it?

LUCILLA

The Senate is with us, and the City

Guard.  We have growing power in the

streets.  But we need a leader.

Someone the people can --

MAXIMUS

So the crown passes to your son.

LUCILLA

No.  So that my son will be safe.

So that we may leave this charnel

house forever and never look back.

Look into my eyes, Maximus, and

believe what I say to you...

LUCILLA

By all the Gods, and in the name of

my father who loved you, and in the

name of the husband I loved... I

swear to stand by your side in this

now and always.

MAXIMUS

What is your son's name?

LUCILLA

Lucius Verus.  Like his father.

MAXIMUS

I weep for him.

LUCILLA

Commodus plans to kill you in your

next match in the arena.  He's

planning something.  I will pray for

you.  As I have always done.

CASSIUS

... in his majestic charity the

Emperor has deigned to this day

favor the people of Rome with an

historical final match.  Returning

to the Colosseum today... after five

years in retirement... Caesar is

pleased to bring you... THE ONLY

UNDEFEATED CHAMPION IN ROMAN

HISTORY...

(the crowd is going

mad)

... THE LEGENDARY... TIGER OF GAUL!!

PROXIMO

Gods!  That old Homicide!  The

Emperor must truly hate you.

MAXIMUS

What can you tell me?

PROXIMO

He cheats.

CASSIUS

(orating)

And from the rocky promontories and

martial bloodlines of Spain...

representing the training lyceum of

Proximo Antoninus... I give you...

THE WARRIOR MAXIMUS!

MAXIMUS AND TIGER

We who are about to die salute you.

LUCIUS' VOICE

Is it true you're a General...?

MAXIMUS

I was a General.

LUCIUS

I saw you fight.  The Carthage

battle too.  I've never seen so much

courage.

MAXIMUS

It doesn't take courage to kill.

LUCIUS

My father was killed.

MAXIMUS

I'm sorry.

LUCIUS

He still comes to me in my dreams.

Do you have a father?

MAXIMUS

I had a father.  He wasn't really my

father but I cared for him very much.

LUCIUS

I hope he comes to you in your

dreams.  My father and I ride horses

in mine.

LUCILLA

Lucius, run along now.  I need to

talk to the General.

MAXIMUS

Where is my army?

LUCILLA

... Maximus will summon his army

from Ostia and he will strike from

the inside as his army strikes from

the outside.  But he insists that

the Senate be present.

GAIUS

We've been ordered to attend.

LUCILLA

How many are with us?

GRACCHUS

About half.  But once the tyrant is

dead.  All.

GRACCHUS

I want to meet him.

LUCILLA

I'll arrange it.

GAIUS

And what of the Emperor?

LUCILLA

He has withdrawn.  He's not eating.

He doesn't go out.  He won't even

see me... I don't know what tempests

rage within him but...

GRACCHUS

We should fear for the blackest

storm.

LUCILLA

Yes.

GAIUS

One question... who is to be the

actual Regicide?

VIBIUS

You didn't kill him.

MAXIMUS

I will not kill another warrior.

There is no honor to it.

KIDS

Maximus the Merciful!  Maximus the

Merciful!

MAXIMUS

Tell him we will enter Rome on the

first day of Commodus' festival.

LUCILLA

And they will march on Rome for you?

MAXIMUS

Yes.  But this letter must go to the

lieutenant named Titus, no one else.

LUCILLA

Captain Marcellus will take it.  And

his City Guard will by with you when

you get to Rome.  Is that enough to

face the Praetorian Guard?

MAXIMUS

(looks to her)

The Felix Regiment will never be

defeated.

GRACCHUS

I only have one question for you,

General... Why?

GRACCHUS

You will lead an army of your

brothers on Rome.  Many will die.

Why?

MAXIMUS

I want Commodus dead.

GRACCHUS

That's not the reason.  Tell me the

truth.

MAXIMUS

Because one night an old man

whispered to me about a dream.  I

will die for that dream.

GRACCHUS

I knew the old man well.  And I

loved him very much.  In our youth

we would spend hours building that

dream together.  After he went to

the wars and lost his way... I was

very cruel.  I tormented him to

remember that dream we spoke of.

MAXIMUS

He did.

GRACCHUS

You can have no idea how much that

means to me.

GRACCHUS

Any man who will die for a whispered

dream deserves my respect.  I honor

you, General.

CENTURION

Madame, the Emperor would like to

see you.

LUCILLA

Caesar...

COMMODUS

I am sorry to have kept you away...

I needed this time to think...

LUCILLA

Of course...

COMMODUS

I limited my world to these four

walls so as to let my mind free...

again and again my mind settles on

but one question... What kind of

world are we making when the people

of Rome prefer a slave in the arena

to their father?

COMMODUS

It is my responsibility to make the

world as it should be.  How is it I

have made this world?

LUCILLA

Brother, do not be influenced by the

mob.  They are a great, faceless

beast --

COMMODUS

They are not "the mob," Lucilla,

they are the people.  They are my

children and all I want to do is

love them.

COMMODUS

Our father loved Maximus... and I

love him still... yet he defies me,

he tasks me in front of my children.

And they love him for it.  Just as

Marcus loved him for it.  Tell me

why, Lucilla.

LUCILLA

They see themselves in him.  They

throw in their own sad dreams

alongside his.  They think he fights

for them.

COMMODUS

And what do I do but fight for

them?!  I give them games to please

them.  I strangle dissent to give

them peace.  I empower the

Praetorians to give them order.

What more can I do?!

COMMODUS

Say I should fight him, in the

arena.  Let my children see who the

Gods truly favor.

LUCILLA

And what if he should win?

COMMODUS

A God is more powerful than a man...

LUCILLA

Caesar, you let this unduly worry

you.  At best he is a passing fancy

-- he is a name, an image on a

banner, ephemeral -- he will be

forgotten as the next fancy

appears --

COMMODUS

But I need to know -- why do they

love him?

LUCILLA

Mercy.

LUCILLA

He will not kill in the arena.  He

is merciful.  As they all wish they

were in their own hearts.

COMMODUS

And for that moment in the arena

they are merciful too.  For a

moment... they are Gods.  Offering

life.

COMMODUS

But who can be more merciful than

the Emperor of Rome?

COMMODUS

Brother... we've taken a sad path

since we were children at Capri,

have we not?

COMMODUS

For my own part... I am sorry it

came to this.  And to you alone of

all men, I acknowledge my errors.

And my regret.  I shall live with my

sin for all my days.

MAXIMUS

As will I, Commodus.  As will I.

COMMODUS

As the first act of my contrition I

offer you the wooden sword of

freedom.

COMMODUS

Take it, brother.  Stand at my side

as a free man worthy of your

ancestors.

MAXIMUS

I only have ancestors because of

you, brother.  You killed everything

that ever lived alongside me.

COMMODUS

Take it, Maximus.  Let us heal that

fatal wound together.

MAXIMUS

This is the new home you cursed me

to.  And I am safer here from your

treachery than I could ever be

outside.

COMMODUS

Will you always mistrust me?

MAXIMUS

Why don't you ask your father that?

MAXIMUS

I have more power as a slave in the

arena than I could ever have as a

free man.  As the Colosseum goes,

the people go.  As the people go,

the Empire goes.

COMMODUS

(tense)

You think this is power?  I could

show you power, slave --

MAXIMUS

No, Caesar... I will show you.

MAXIMUS

The Felix Regiment will come from

here.  We'll face the body of the

Praetorians outside -- here.  Once

inside, my archers will take up

position to counter opposition

inside the Colosseum.  I'll enter

and join you -- we'll attack here --

MAXIMUS

-- a covert assault from within.

VIBIUS

We'll be killed.

MAXIMUS

Probably.

MAXIMUS

But if we aren't... think of the

glory.  Do you remember glory,

Gladiator?

JUBA

And if we die that day -- we die

free men worthy of our ancestors.

VIBIUS

You didn't know my ancestors.  A

rotten bunch.

MAXIMUS

Then be worthy of him.  The old

Titan who would rather die bravely

in a just battle than slink off to

grow old and fat.

JUBA

And impotent.

VIBIUS

If I die, I want a hundred whores at

my funeral.

COMMODUS

Where is my sister?

HANDMAIDEN

She's out, sir...

COMMODUS

Where?

HANDMAIDEN

I... don't know, Caesar.

COMMODUS

Where is my sister?

MAXIMUS

Was it Centurion...?  General...?

PROXIMO

Captain.

PROXIMO

How did you know?

MAXIMUS

A soldier knows a soldier.

PROXIMO

All that was a long time ago.  Too

much wine and too many women.  And

too much money.

MAXIMUS

No --

PROXIMO

This is who I am...

(he pats his ample

belly)

You see?  There was a time I would

stand against ten men and never give

an inch, spitting into the jaws of

Hades all the while.  There was a

time my heart swelled to strap on

the armor of Rome.  But now...

PROXIMO

Now I am just an entertainer.

MAXIMUS

You said something to me once.  You

said in this life, we all die.  All

we can choose is how we die.  And

how we are remembered.  Do you

recall those words?

PROXIMO

Yes.

MAXIMUS

Then be remembered proudly.  This is

your time, Proximo.  Stand at my

side and be what you were.  What you

truly are.  One last time.

PROXIMO

(laughing)

You might have spared yourself the

speech, General.  The lady Lucilla

bought all my gladiators two hours

ago!

MAXIMUS

You pox-ridden bastard -- !

PROXIMO

I am the richest trainer in the

Empire!  And I will let my

gladiators do anything you like!

Conspire away, General!

PROXIMO

But I tell you -- if you survive

this madness I want you to go into

business with me.  I'll give you a

quarter of my holdings.

MAXIMUS

(standing)

A quarter?!

PROXIMO

A third.  And not a hair more.  And

you'll have to start in the

provinces!  Cleaning up the lion

shit!

MAXIMUS

You know, if you were half so awful

as you pretend, you'd be a

terrifying man.

MAXIMUS

Lucilla --

LUCILLA

Don't even say it.  I know it's

dangerous -- but I had to see you.

Captain Marcellus has gone to the

army with your message as you

instructed.

MAXIMUS

Good.

LUCILLA

He says the City Guard will be ready

at the south road at noon.  They can

only wait for an hour so --

MAXIMUS

You've told me this already.

LUCILLA

Did I?  All right then.  So

everything is prepared.  The Senate

will be in attendance and you have

your gladiators -- the usual cohort

of Praetorians will be inside the

arena --

MAXIMUS

Lucilla... why are you here?

LUCILLA

Tell me honestly... please... do you

think it will work?

MAXIMUS

No.

LUCILLA

Do you think we'll all die?

MAXIMUS

Yes.

LUCILLA

Will you swear something to me?

MAXIMUS

Yes.

LUCILLA

Will you swear it on the memory of

your son?

MAXIMUS

Yes.

LUCILLA

By all that you have ever loved...

swear that if you survive you will

take my son out of Rome.  Swear that

you will go far away and never

return.

MAXIMUS

(deeply)

I will.

MAXIMUS

And if I should not survive... swear

to me that you will honor my family

in your prayers always.

LUCILLA

I will.

LUCILLA

Had I not been the daughter of

Rome...

MAXIMUS

Shhh... my heart breaks enough.

COMMODUS

Sister... join us.  I've been

reading to dear Lucius.

LUCIUS

I've been reading too.

COMMODUS

Yes, he's a very smart little boy.

He'll make a grand Emperor one day.

COMMODUS

Join us, sister.

COMMODUS

We've been reading about the great

Julius and his adventures in Egypt.

LUCIUS

She killed herself with a snake!

COMMODUS

(to Lucius)

And just wait until you hear what

happened to some of our other

ancestors!  If you're very good,

tomorrow night I'll tell you the

story of Emperor Claudius.  He was

betrayed!  By those closest to

him...

(he glances up to

Lucilla)

... by his own blood... they

whispered in dark corners and went

out late at night and conspired and

conspired...

COMMODUS

But the Emperor Claudius knew that

they were up to something dire.  He

knew they were busy little bees.

And one night he sat down with one

of them and he looked at her and he

said:  "Tell me what you have been

doing, busy little bee, or I shall

strike down those dearest to you.

You shall watch as I bathe in their

blood."  And the bee knew he spoke

the truth, for the Emperor always

speaks the truth.  And what do you

think happened then, Lucius?

LUCIUS

(still pouring over

the scrolls)

I don't know, Uncle.

COMMODUS

(glaring at Lucilla)

The bee told him everything.

PROXIMO

Release them!  Release them all!

ARM THEM!

PROXIMO

Come --

MAXIMUS

But --

PROXIMO

If you want to live -- follow me --

VIBIUS

(calling to them)

Go, Spaniard!  We'll show these

Roman dogs how gladiators fight!

PROXIMO

All the old gladiator schools have

tunnels to the Colosseum -- most

have long since collapsed --

JUBA

How did they know?

MAXIMUS

We were betrayed.

JUBA

(stops)

I'll stay here.  In case they

follow.

JUBA

Go!  Bring us the army!

PROXIMO

Quickly --

PROXIMO

(points)

Down that corridor is the butchery

-- the blood sloughs lead to the

Tiber.  Gods watch over you.

MAXIMUS

You're not coming?

PROXIMO

They are killing my men!

PROXIMO

Gods... they're killing them all.

LUCIUS

What is that fire?

COMMODUS

Why that's a bonfire, Lucius.  I

arranged it just for you.

PRAETORIAN

Caesar...

COMMODUS

Oh... that's for my sister.

TITUS

By all the Gods...

MAXIMUS

Old friend...

TITUS

You're returned from Hades!  By all

the Gods!

MAXIMUS

Where is he?

MAXIMUS

I forgive you.

COMMODUS

(serene)

Rome... This is the day that was

foretold.  This is the day when your

father takes away all fear...

(he holds up his

hands)

With these hands I shall destroy

your enemies so that you may sleep

always and forever in peace.  From

this day forth let it be known that

I, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus,

have surmounted mortality.  That I,

Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus,

assume my destined place... at the

side of the Gods.

COMMODUS

And as a righteous God, I shall ever

protect you.  I shall cradle the

world on my benevolent hands and

clasp it to my heart.  So I have

spoken!  And let the heavens tremble

at my might!

COMMODUS

This day I reclaim Rome for her

people.  I shall give you the

rebirth of your Empire!  Reborn and

cleansed of her enemies!

COMMODUS

I will make a new Rome!  Founded as

it was at the beginning!  Archers --

GIVE US BLOOD!

MAXIMUS

Throw down your weapons or we will

kill you.

MAXIMUS

(he turns to his men)

FELIX REGIMENT!  DO HONOR TO YOUR

ANCESTORS!  I SALUTE YOU!

COMMODUS

As it was at the beginning so is it

now.  The great She-Wolf of Rome

will again suckle us, again ravage

our enemies -- AND BRING US A WORLD

REBORN!

COMMODUS

So it was for Romulus and Remus,

sons of Mars, so shall it be for us!

The great She-Wolf will --

LUCILLA

Remember your mother.

CENTURION BODY GUARD

Caesar -- we must go -- !

COMMODUS

GET THE BOY!

CENTURION BODY GUARD

THIS WAY, CAESAR!

MAXIMUS

Captain?

MAXIMUS

(re: Commodus and

the others)

Where are they going?!

PROXIMO

This way!

COMMODUS

KILL THE BOY!

MAXIMUS

For my wife!

MAXIMUS

For my son!

MAXIMUS

For my father!

MAXIMUS

We who are about to die salute you.

GRACCHUS

General, the purple is yours if you

so desire.  The Senate will support

you.

MAXIMUS

Rome... you are better than this.

Look inside yourselves.  I challenge

you to find your true voice.  Help

the Senate speak for you.  Make them

your champion... And dare to think

what could be.

MAXIMUS

I give you back the dream.

MAXIMUS

When everything has calmed down,

lead an orderly withdrawal.  Take

them home.

FADE TO:

MAXIMUS

It doesn't look it now... but soon

we'll have it growing again... Next

year there will be vines, and then

there will be grapes... It will be

alive.

FADE OUT.

THE END
