1492: CONQUEST OF PARADISE

1492: CONQUEST OF PARADISE

by

Roselyne Bosch

REVISED

September 23, 1991

CUT TO:

SANCHEZ

Your Majesty would wish to know the

true facts concerning the island of

Hispanola, our first settlement in

the New World, and the activities

there of your servant, Christopher

Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea,

Governor of that Island.  You will

remember with what hopes and

promises he beguiled us -- the truth

is that he now presides over a state

of chaos, degradation and madness

beyond imagining.

SANCHEZ

From the beginning, Columbus proved

himself incapable of managing the

affairs of the island.  He appointed

his brothers to important positions,

at once injuring the pride and

dignity of the nobles who had gone

with him.  He promised to build a

city, the City of Isabel, named

after Your Majesty.  What he

actually built was nothing but a

collection of huts, and that in the

wrong place, for all of it was

easily swept away by rain and mud.

Is that not so, Brother Buyl?

BROTHER BUYL

Yes, Your Honor.

SANCHEZ

He promised gold.  Not finding the

easy quantities he promised,

Columbus commanded each Indian to

pay an annual tribute.  Most being

unable to, they were barbarously

punished, against the express wish

of Your Christian Majesties...

SANCHEZ

Since provocation and injustice

never ceases, many of the Indians

have fled to the forests, or have

begun to slay the Christians.

ISABEL

Could it be so?

BROTHER BUYL

Yes, Your Majesty.

SANCHEZ

But there is worse.  From the

beginning, he forced the nobles to

undergo physical labor, treating

them equally with the Indians, all

of them reduced to slavery.  When

the nobleman Adrian de Moxica

protested against such treatment...

(he pauses)

... he was executed.

(pause)

Is that not true also, Brother

Buyl?

BROTHER BUYL

Yes, Your Honor.  It is all true.

All of it.  I saw it with my own

eyes.

SANCHEZ

He has lost control.  His great

arrogance has led him into

depravity.  He encourages our

soldiers to marry the native women.

He promised a paradise, but he has

made a hell full of all its horrors.

ISABEL

Is that the man I knew, Treasurer

Sanchez?

SANCHEZ

Yes, Your Majesty.

CUT TO:

FERNANDO (V.O.)

Of all the words my Father wrote and

there were many, I remember these

the most.  "Nothing that results

from human progress is achieved with

unanimous consent..."

FERNANDO (V.O.)

"And those who are enlightened

before the others are condemned to

purse that light in spite of

others..."

FERNANDO (V.O.)

There was a time when the New World

didn't exist...

DISSOLVE TO:

FERNANDO (V.O.)

... The sun set in the west on an

ocean where no man had dared to

venture.  And beyond that,

infinity...

FERNANDO (V.O.)

Once I asked my Father where he

wanted to go.  And he replied:  "I

want to travel all over the seas.  I

want to get behind the weather..."

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

Fernando!

FERNANDO

Diego!

COLUMBUS

Diego!  Aren't you going to kiss

your brother?

MARCHENA

Diego, take Fernando to the dining

hall.  He must be hungry.

DIEGO

Yes, Father.

MARCHENA

Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure

to teach -- but so serious...

Brothers should be raised together,

Colon.  Even brothers from different

mothers...

COLUMBUS

Father, I am doing what I think is

the best for him.  And he has the

teacher I would have chosen for

myself.

MARCHENA

Just be careful you don't lose him.

MARCHENA

(fumbles in a pocket

under his robe)

I have something for you.

MARCHENA

You will be heard at the University

of Salamanca...

COLUMBUS

God... That's in a week!

MARCHENA

That's what it says.

COLUMBUS

How did you manage it?

MARCHENA

(smiling)

With some difficulty.  I had to

promise them you were not a total

fool.

MARCHENA

Why do you wish to sail west?

COLUMBUS

To open a new route to Asia.  At the

moment there are only two ways of

reaching it...

COLUMBUS

By sea, sailing around the African

Continent -- the journey takes a

year...

COLUMBUS

Or by land...

COLUMBUS (O.S.)

... But the Turks have closed this

route to all Christians.  Trading

with the Orient has become arduous,

if not dangerous.

(he pauses)

There is a third way...

COLUMBUS

By sailing West across the Ocean

Sea.

MARCHENA

How can you be so certain?  The

Ocean is said to be infinite.

COLUMBUS

Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are

no more than 750 leagues west of the

Canary Islands.

MARCHENA

How can you be so certain?

COLUMBUS

The calculations of Toscanelli Marin

de Tyr, Esdras...

MARCHENA

(interrupting)

Esdras is a Jew.

COLUMBUS

So was Christ!

MARCHENA

Two minutes... and already you're a

dead man.  Don't let passion

overwhelm you, Colon.

COLUMBUS

(mockingly)

I'll try to remember that,

Marchena...

MARCHENA

Father Marchena!

COLUMBUS

(ignoring this)

Passion is something one cannot

control!

MARCHENA

(heatedly)

You get so carried away when you are

being contradicted!

COLUMBUS

I've been contradicted all my

life... Eternity!

MARCHENA

(amused)

Only God knows the meaning of such

words, my son.

COLUMBUS

Diego.

COLUMBUS

Would you like to come and stay with

us?

COLUMBUS

I'll do whatever makes you happy.

DIEGO

I am happy, Father.

FERNANDO

Look, Father!

COLUMBUS

Fernando!

COLUMBUS

Fernando!

COLUMBUS

Executions.  In the square.

COLUMBUS

They've agreed to see me in a week.

COLUMBUS

I could be gone for years.

BEATRIX

I know.

COLUMBUS

I haven't given you much of a life.

BEATRIX

(amused)

Well... that's true.  I have a child

by a man who won't marry me!  Who's

always leaving...

COLUMBUS

Are we going to argue?

BEATRIX

I'd love to argue with you

sometimes.  But you're never here!

COLUMBUS

Perhaps I was never meant to live

with a woman...

BEATRIX

(still kissing him)

I find that hard to believe.

DISSOLVE TO:

COLUMBUS

Fernando, don't you think we are

lucky to live with such a beautiful

woman?

MONK

(hesitant)

Christopher Columbus?

AROJAZ

You say Asia can be found by sailing

west?

COLUMBUS

Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage

should not take more than six or

seven weeks.

AROJAZ

Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is

precisely where our opinions

differ...

(pause)

Are you familiar with the work of

Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?

COLUMBUS

I am, Your Eminence

AROJAZ

Then you cannot ignore that

according to their calculations, the

circumference of the Earth is

approximately...

(he leans forward)

22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes

the ocean... uncrossable.

AROJAZ

But you may have found new evidence

proving that these men of knowledge

are totally mistaken!

COLUMBUS

Your Excellencies are aware of the

statements of Marin de Tyr?

HERNANDO DE TALAVERA

We are.

COLUMBUS

Then you are also aware that his

theories contradict Ptolemeus... De

Tyr believes the Ocean to be only

750 leagues...

COLUMBUS

The Florentine Toscanelli and the

French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both

think that Marin de Tyr is accurate

in his calculations.  And therefore,

that the ocean can be crossed.

DIEGO DE DEZA

Gentlemen, let us suppose Marin de

Tyr is right...

(the laughter

subsides)

Are we here to examine this proposal

or not?

DIEGO DE DEZA

(to Columbus)

In your opinion, how long would the

voyage be?

COLUMBUS

Seven weeks.  Six, during the summer

months.

AROJAZ

Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has

been corrected many times over the

centuries by the finest geographers.

Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a

year!

VICUNA

How would the crew survive without

being able to land for fresh water?

Water is undrinkable after six

weeks!  You'd never be able to turn

back!

COLUMBUS

We wouldn't have to turn back!  We

would find land at this point!

AROJAZ

Senor Colon, an experienced captain

such as yourself will understand our

concern with the crew.  I am not

willing to have on my conscience the

loss of men who would have relied

upon our judgment.

COLUMBUS

Excellency, you are right.

COLUMBUS

I am a seaman, not a scholar... But

as a simple man craving for

knowledge, I have read all the work

of these renowned geographers and

discovered that none of them could

agree on the exact width of this

ocean...

COLUMBUS

Therefore, as a modest man, I

wonder:  who is right?

COLUMBUS

Who is right?  This question remains

unanswered.

COLUMBUS

Your Eminence, there is only one way

to settle the matter.  And that is

to make the journey.

(to the assembly,

with passion)

I am ready to risk my life to prove

it possible.

AROJAZ

Your life, and that of others!

COLUMBUS

If they agree to follow me, yes.

SANCHEZ (O.S.)

Suppose you cross this ocean.

Suppose you reach Asia.  What would

Spain do there?

COLUMBUS

Trade, Your Excellency.  According

to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China

is one of the richest of the world.

Even the meanest buildings are

roofed with gold.

AROJAZ

(interrupting)

Is that all that interests you?

Gold?

COLUMBUS

No.  The Portuguese have already

discovered black-skinned people.  I,

too, will find other populations --

and bring them to the word of God.

AROJAZ

Christopher -- Christo Ferens -- the

Bearer of the Cross!

MONK

(ironic)

And Colon -- the one who populates!

AROJAZ

If God intended our proximity to

Asia, do you believe he would have

waited for you to show it to the

world?

COLUMBUS

Did He not choose a carpenter's son

to reveal Himself to the world?

AROJAZ

So you consider yourself the chosen

one?

AROJAZ

Don't you realize your words could

be considered heretical?

COLUMBUS

(calmly)

Blind faith is what I consider

heresy!

COLUMBUS

(quietly)

Asia can be found to the west -- and

I will prove it.

AROJAZ

IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!

AROJAZ

The Treasurer of Spain honors us

with his presence.

SANCHEZ

The State has some reason to be

interested in this man's

proposition, Your Eminence...

AROJAZ

The Judgment is ours!

SANCHEZ

Naturally.  But I would really

deplore the loss of such a potential

opportunity for Spain for a...

dispute over a point of geography.

AROJAZ

(interrupting)

He is a mercenary!  Did he not

already try to convince the King of

Portugal of his absurd notions?

SANCHEZ

Indeed.  The world is full of

mercenaries -- and states often make

use of them, when it benefits them.

(casually)

My only concern is the welfare and

prosperity of Spain.

AROJAZ

You would use your influence to

assist this... intriguer?

SANCHEZ

You know, Your Eminence, the

fascinating thing about power, is

that what can be given so

effortlessly...

SANCHEZ

... can so easily be taken away.

MARCHENA

... and therefore nothing could

justify the participation of Your

Highnesses in the venture that

relies upon such feeble assumptions,

and which any man of knowledge

would take to be impractical... if

not impossible.

COLUMBUS

They didn't listen.  They didn't

want to listen!

MARCHENA

You mustn't give way to despair.

You must wait.

COLUMBUS

Wait!  I've waited seven years

already!  How much longer do you

want me to wait?

MARCHENA

If God intends you to go, then you

will go.

COLUMBUS

(angrily)

Damn God!

MARCHENA

Colon!

COLUMBUS

Damn all of you!  You all set up

theories based on what?  You never

leave the safety of your studies!

Go out!  Find out what the world is

about and then tell me something I

can listen to!

COLUMBUS

These don't mean anything!  They're

full of assumptions!  Out of the

heads of old men who've never been

past the end of their gardens!

MARCHENA

No...!  My books...!

COLUMBUS

All of them!  Just lies!

MARCHENA

Colon!  Don't!

FERNANDO

Father?

DIEGO

Sssshhhh...!  One can't speak to a

man doing penance.

FERNANDO

What can you do?

DIEGO

Nothing.  That's the point,

Fernando.

PINZON (O.S.)

Senor Colon?

PINZON

Ah, thank God!  I've been looking

all over Seville for you!  Never

expected to find a sailor in a

monastery, eh?

PINZON

Name's Pinzon, by the way.  Martin

Alonzo Pinzon.  I'm a ship owner

from Palos...

PINZON

(indicating the

monk)

Is he a spy?

PINZON

What is it?  Are you a Trappist?

PINZON

Vow of silence...?  Penance?

PINZON

Jesus!  Just my luck!

PINZON

Listen.  I'll do the talking for

both of us.  You just nod.  Agreed?

Just as I do with the wife.

PINZON

I know that the Commission turned

you down, right?  What do you

expect?  You're a foreigner... But I

want to help you.

PINZON

You wonder why I believe in you?

Hey, I am a seaman.  And we don't

like to be told where to go, and

where not to go.

PINZON

I don't look like it, but I have

friends at the Court.  The Treasurer

of Aragon, for example.  He finances

me.  His name's Santangel.  Ever

heard of him?

PINZON

He can get you an audience with the

Queen!  You know why...?  She owes

him money.  That's how it is.  You

-- me -- the Queen -- the world and

his mistress -- agreed?

PINZON

So.  What do you say?

COLUMBUS

Where can I meet this man?

PINZON

(indicating with a

nod)

Immediately.

SANTANGEL

These people built Granada...

Centuries ago!  It is a great

victory over the Moors, Don Colon --

and yet what a tragedy it is!

COLUMBUS

Is this a good time to meet her?

SANTANGEL

It couldn't be better.  Victors

can't say no.

SANTANGEL

Your Excellency... truly grateful...

your help... as ever...

ISABEL

Rise...!  Come forward!

ISABEL

I should not even be listening to

you, since my council said no.  But

Santangel tells me you are a man of

honor and sincerity... And Sanchez,

that you are not a fool.

COLUMBUS

(bold)

No more than the woman who said she

would take Granada from the Moors.

ISABEL

The ocean is uncrossable?

COLUMBUS

What did they say about Granada

before today?

ISABEL

(a beat)

That she was impregnable.

ISABEL

I cannot ignore the verdict of my

council.

COLUMBUS

Surely you can do anything you want.

ISABEL

How little you know.

COLUMBUS

May I speak freely?

ISABEL

(with a smile)

You show no inclination to speak

otherwise!

COLUMBUS

I know what I see.  I see someone

who doesn't accept the world as it

is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a

women who thinks... "What if?"...

ISABEL

(amused at his

familiarity)

A woman?

COLUMBUS

Forgive me... but you're the only

Queen I know.

ISABEL

Then we are equal... since you are

the only sailor I know!

ISABEL

How old are you, Senor Colon?

COLUMBUS

Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And

you?

ISABEL

Thirty eight...

ISABEL

You will be informed of our

decision.

COLUMBUS

Actually, I thought you were younger

than me!

ADMINISTRATOR

... and he demands... he DEMANDS to

be made a Knight, with the right to

bear the Golden Spurs!  He will

receive the title of Don Cristobal

Colon -- which will be extended to

his descendants for ever more...

SANCHEZ

Go on!

ADMINISTRATOR

He will be named Great Admiral of

the Ocean Sea.  Viceroy of the West

Indies... Governor of all islands or

lands discovered or as will be

discovered with his help...

ADMINISTRATOR

The highest titles of nobility, Your

Excellency!  To an immigrant

sheltered by monks!

SANCHEZ

Furthermore he will receive one

eight of all wealth or monies,

precious gems, pearls, metals,

spices and other lucrative sources

conquered within the boundaries of

his admiralty...

SANCHEZ

It's very underdone.

ADMINISTRATOR

(exploding)

Underdone!  It's monstrous,

Excellency!

SANCHEZ

No, the pheasant.  It's almost raw.

SANCHEZ

You worry too much, Carvajal... The

man will have to lower his demands.

Believe me, he WILL!

COLUMBUS

I WON'T!

SANCHEZ

(calmly)

We have considered your -- demands

very carefully, Senor Colon... Your

expectations are... excessive, in

every way.

COLUMBUS

If I am right, my requests are fair!

SANCHEZ

We have prepared our own contract...

COLUMBUS

No...

SANCHEZ

No?

COLUMBUS

NO...!  I have waited too long,

fought too hard.  Now you expect me

to take all the risks while you take

the profit!  No... I will not be

your servant!

SANCHEZ

I remind you, Senor Colon, that you

are in no position to bargain with

me.

COLUMBUS

I'm not bargaining!

SANCHEZ

(steely)

Then you are too ambitious.

COLUMBUS

And were you never ambitious,

Excellency?  Or is ambition only a

virtue among the nobles, a fault for

the rest of us?

SANCHEZ

(abrupt)

If you won't accept our proposal,

we'll simply find someone who will.

COLUMBUS

If you can do that, Excellency --

I'll become a monk!

ISABEL

You were right, Don Sanchez... His

demands could never be granted.

SANCHEZ

Never, Your Majesty.  Although...

SANCHEZ

... Although one may always

renegotiate a contract.  Especially

signed by Royal Hands.

SANCHEZ

(quietly)

... Into a monk...

ISABEL

(with a smile)

Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't

it?

(turning to Sanchez)

Call him back!

COLUMBUS

YEEEEEEES!

COLUMBUS

She said yes.

BEATRIX

(moved)

Thank God...

COLUMBUS

If I ever come back, I swear I

will...

BEATRIX

(softly)

I'm not asking you to swear to

anything.

COLUMBUS

I don't want you to wait for me.

BEATRIX

(smiling)

That's something you can't decide.

FERNANDO (O.S.)

You can't go there!

COLUMBUS

Why not?

COLUMBUS

There aren't any monsters, Fernando.

The only monsters are in here...

(he taps his own

forehead)

Watch!

FERNANDO

I want to go with you!

COLUMBUS

There'll be a time.

FERNANDO

You promise?

(Columbus nods his

head)

Do you swear on St. Christopher...?

FERNANDO

Do you swear on all the Holy Saints

in heaven?

COLUMBUS

(laughing)

Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!

MARCHENA

In Nomine Patris et Filius, et

Spiritus Sancti.

COLUMBUS

Forgive me, Father.  For I have

sinned.

MARCHENA

I am listening, my son.

COLUMBUS

Father, I have betrayed my family.

I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed

you.

MARCHENA

What are you saying?

COLUMBUS

I lied.  The journey will be longer

than I said.

MARCHENA

How long?

COLUMBUS

I am not sure... It could be twice

the distance.

MARCHENA

May God forgive you...!  You must

tell them!  You must tell your men!

COLUMBUS

If I tell them, they won't follow

me.  You know that I am right,

Father.  You trust me...

MARCHENA

My son, my son...

(he shakes his head)

Your certitudes are sometimes

frightening...

(pause)

Christopher, you must speak to them.

And if you don't I will.

COLUMBUS

You are bound by an oath, Father.

MARCHENA

I believed in you...

COLUMBUS

Give me absolution.

COLUMBUS

Give me absolution, Father!

MARCHENA (O.S.)

Ispo Te Absoluto.  May God forgive

you and have mercy on your soul,

Christopher Columbus.  Go in peace.

DISSOLVE TO:

COLUMBUS

Be good to your mother, Fernando.

Do you promise?

BEATRIX

Speak to Diego.

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

Diego!  Here!

SANTANGEL

(casually)

Take care of my investment, wherever

you're going!

COLUMBUS

(ambiguous)

I have to tell you Santangel.  I

don't know where on earth I am

going!

SAILOR

Vaya con Dios!  (Go with God!)

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

(softly)

Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may

God be with us...

MENDEZ

God be with us admiral.

COLUMBUS

What is it Mendez?  Speak!

MENDEZ

Well... It's the men, Sir.  They

wonder how you know our position.

We've lost sight from land days

ago...

COLUMBUS

(still taking

readings)

And what do you think Mendez?

MENDEZ

Well, I surely know what a quadrant

is!  But I've never seen it used at

night before.

COLUMBUS

Come over here.

COLUMBUS

Now, find the North Star.  Do you

have it?

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS (O.S.)

Steady yourself...!  Keep the plumb

line vertical...

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

Don't move!  A mistake of one degree

and we'll be off 6,000 leagues!

COLUMBUS

What do you read?

MENDEZ

Twenty eight.

COLUMBUS

That's it.  The twenty eighth

parallel.  And we'll follow it until

we reach land.

ALONSO

How do you know land is on the

twenty eighth parallel?

ALONSO

Chicken-ass face!

ALONSO

Shit!

ALONSO

I never seen heat like this!  Not

even in Las Minas!

SAILOR

The water's going putrid in the

barrels.

ALONSO

You'll be drinking your own piss...

For the glory of Spain... and

Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!

ALONSO

What are you listening to, chicken

ass?

SAILOR

Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no

harm.

ALONSO

With a face like that?

(to boy)

I don't want you looking at me.  You

hear?

ALONSO

He's the devil's child...

SAILOR

We'll all go crazy...

SAILOR

Culo de galina es el hijo del

demonio... (Chicken ass mouth is the

devil's child... Born from the loins

of a stinky old goat etc...)

CUT TO:

ALONSO

We should have seen land.

SAILOR

We left three weeks ago, Alonso.

Can't be that near.

ALONSO

Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I

don't like the smell of the sea

around here.  Smells like a cunt.

Bad sign...

COOK

(shaking his head)

Of course it smells like it!  That's

why sailors take to the sea!

ALONSO

And why does this one take to the

sea?  Nobody knows.  Never says a

word...

MENDEZ

To your post!  At once!

SHIP'S BOY

Mark.  Twenty nine, Sir!

COLUMBUS

Six hundred and twenty nine.

CUT TO:

SHIP'S BOY

Six hundred and twenty nine!

OFFICER

Six hundred and twenty nine, Sir!

PINZON

I heard.

OFFICER

Captain, I don't understand.

PINZON

I think I do.

CUT TO:

MENDEZ

Continue rowing!

ALONSO

To where?

OFFICER

Captain Pinzon requests permission

to board.

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

Granted.

PINZON

You lied!  You cheated!  We're way

past 750 leagues!

COLUMBUS

(calmly)

Six days ago, yes.

PINZON

You must be mad...!

COLUMBUS

We have to keep the hopes of these

men alive!

PINZON

We're on the verge of a mutiny,

Colon!

COLUMBUS

You think I don't know that?

PINZON

We're lost!

COLUMBUS

The land is there.  I know it!

PINZON

You don't know anything!  Listen

Colon, these are my ships, right?

So I'm telling you we're turning

back!

COLUMBUS

And then what?  Half of the water

has gone, the rest is nearly putrid!

You know that!

PINZON

(apoplectic)

Jesus Maria!  I should have never

listened to you!

COLUMBUS

You never did.  You did all the

talking for both of us, remember?

PINZON

You bloody...

COLUMBUS

Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now

is go forward!  Think about that!

PINZON

You tell that to them!

COLUMBUS

You're right.  Let the men decide.

COLUMBUS

Who gave you the order to come on

board?

ALONSO

God doesn't want us to cross the

ocean...!  This voyage is cursed!

COLUMBUS

Cursed?

ALONSO

We set sail for greed.  God has

abandoned us.  The voyage is cursed.

There are signs...

COLUMBUS

This boy has the voice of an angel.

What comes out of his mouth is

blessed, Alonso.  What comes out of

your is evil.

COLUMBUS

Listen to me!  Every man is afraid

who does something for the first

time.  But those who overcome their

fears, will find their rewards.  I

do not know if it is God's will that

we cross this ocean -- but I am

certain it is the devil who puts

fears into our hearts...

COLUMBUS

This jacket to the first man who

sights land!  I want a man up that

mast day and night.

COLUMBUS

You start first.

MENDEZ

Alonso!  Jaime!  Don't let this wind

escape us.

PINZON

(murmuring)

You lucky bastard...

COLUMBUS

Pinzon, the more I sail, the luckier

I get.

MENDEZ

Shall I take my turn?

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

(murmuring)

Mendez!  Mendez!

COLUMBUS

Land...

CUT TO:

SHIP'S BOY

TIERRA...!  TIERRA!

COLUMBUS

By the... by the Grace of... God...

COLUMBUS

(pulling himself

together)

In the name of their Gracious

Majesties of Castille and Aragon,

and by all the powers vested in me,

I claim this island and name it San

Salvador.

MENDEZ

(whispering

urgently)

Arquebuses!

PINZON

(warningly)

Colon!

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

We have come here in peace, and we

will behave with honor.  They are

not savages and neither will you be.

Treat these people as you would your

own wives and your own children.

Neither are you free to take what

you will; for a seashell you give a

bandana.  You will respect their

beliefs.  Pillage will be punished

by the whip.  Rape by the sword.

PINZON

Gold...!  Gold!

COLUMBUS

(to Pinzon)

Give it to him!

PINZON

(irritated)

By God!  That's the worst trade of

my life!

COLUMBUS (V.O.)

October 21st, 1492.  I think we have

returned to Eden.  Surely this is

how the world once was, before the

beginning of time.  I believe no man

will ever see this land again as we

do, for the first time...

DISSOLVE TO:

OLD INDIAN

Cuba!  Cuba!

UTAPAN

Say not here!  Cuba!

COLUMBUS

What is it?  A tribe?  An island?

UTAPAN

Island.  Far.

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

Help him!

SAILOR

Do something!  Help him!

UTAPAN

He dead.

COLUMBUS

Utapan!  Wait!

PINZON

Well... You'll have to continue

without me...

COLUMBUS

No.  It's enough.  What would you

say to a drop of Jerez, Pinzon?

PINZON

And a nice slice of Santa Fe lamb!

I'd sell my soul for it.

(to his officer)

Help me up.  I've got to piss, gold.

UTAPAN

He cures.

UTAPAN

(to Columbus)

You come!  You speak first!

COLUMBUS

Tell the Chief we thank him.

UTAPAN

Chief knows.

COLUMBUS

Tell him his country is very

beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving

men here -- to build a fort.

COLUMBUS

Tell him we will return very soon.

Many of us.

UTAPAN

Chief says -- how many?

COLUMBUS

Thousands.

UTAPAN

Why?

COLUMBUS

To bring the word of God.

UTAPAN

Chief says -- he has a God.

COLUMBUS

(pursuing)

... and also to bring medicine.

UTAPAN

Chief says...

COLUMBUS

(interrupting)

He has medicine.

(pause)

Tell him we admire his people.

UTAPAN

Chief says he knows you like his...

(searches for the

word)

Women...

COLUMBUS

(with a little

smile)

That's a beginning...

COLUMBUS (V.O.)

March 1493... Thirty nine of my men

volunteered to stay behind.  God

willing we will be back in less than

a year...

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS (V.O.)

... Several men are ill.  We did not

find signs of civilization.  No

cities, no temples... Nothing that

resembles Marco Polo's descriptions.

My ships are not filled with the

spices and the gold that Spain was

hoping for.  But this land

intoxicates the senses like the

strongest of perfumes... And all I

can think of, is to return to these

untamed lands...

COLUMBUS

(screaming to the

sailors)

Get below!  All of you!  Go!

COLUMBUS

(to Mendez)

Stay with me!

COLUMBUS

We may have to cut it!

COLUMBUS

(screaming out)

I'll stay here -- to decide if we

cut it.  Help me!

COLUMBUS

(screaming)

Now go!

COLUMBUS

I said -- below deck, Mendez!

COLUMBUS

One... two... three... four...

COLUMBUS

Damn you!

COLUMBUS

One... two... three... four...

five...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

AROJAZ

It won't be easy to get rid of your

prophet now, Don Sanchez.

SANCHEZ

(whispering)

On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It

seems to me the man is preparing his

own cross.

COLUMBUS

You must not inhale, but simply

allow the palate to enjoy the flavor

of the Tobacco...

MOXICA

(deeply embarrassed)

And you say this is an Indian vice?

By God!  I don't see any kind of

pleasure that would make this a sin.

COLUMBUS

The Indians have no such word, Don

Moxica.

ISABEL

Do they have such thoughts?

COLUMBUS

They come and go as naked as the day

God created them...

COLUMBUS

They don't see sin in their

nakedness.  They live according to

nature, in a never ending summer.

The islands are covered with trees,

filled with blossoms and fruits.

And...

SANCHEZ

(interrupting)

Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what

about gold?

COLUMBUS

These are gifts for Your Majesty.

ISABEL

We are more than gratified.

MASTER

Si!  Si!  Muy bien!  Excellente!

(Yes!  Yes!  Good!  Excellent!)

SANCHEZ

You defend yourself admirably...

COLUMBUS

... for a commoner?

SANCHEZ

To your second expedition.

SANCHEZ

Don Colon -- Don Alonso de

Bobadilla.  A man who knows our

laws.

BOBADILLA

I understand that you will soon be

appointing Governors for the

islands?  Is it not so?

COLUMBUS

Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those

positions have already been taken.

BOBADILLA

(disappointed)

May I ask by whom?

COLUMBUS

Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.

BOBADILLA

I trust they are men of quality.

COLUMBUS

But we do have a lack of notaries.

You should contact my

administration.

SANCHEZ

(amused)

Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my

Dear Don Cristobal.

COLUMBUS

Good!  We are also in need of

judges.  Except there are no

thieves!

BOBADILLA

(to Sanchez)

I see I was mistaken.  Don Colon

has no need for my services...

SANCHEZ

(amused)

You seem to have a special talent

for making friends.

COLUMBUS

What...?  Do I have so many already?

SANCHEZ

(seriously)

To rise so high, in so short a time,

is a dangerous occupation.

(kindly)

A little hypocrisy goes a long way.

BARTOLOME

You might have given us a choice!

GIACOMO

Bartolome is stronger, more capable

than I will ever be...

COLUMBUS

I need both of you.  What are you

afraid of?  We are living what we

always dreamt of.

GIACOMO

You know I never shared those dreams

with you.

COLUMBUS

Are you saying you refuse to help?

BARTOLOME

(amused)

You bastard... you always had your

own way...

COLUMBUS

Let me show you something.

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

Of course... Of course... We'll see

to it... Yes... Thank you... Soon...

Soon...

COLUMBUS

(indicating the

applicants)

Now -- you tell me.  Who can I

trust?

(almost amused)

We're brothers!  We must be a House.

A bloodline!  In this country one

can't exist alone!  I need you...!

Both of you!

SOLDIER

Where is the Admiral?  Has anyone

seen the Admiral?

COLUMBUS

He is here!  What is it?

MAN

Admiral!  The horses have arrived.

COLUMBUS

I know.  I saw them!  Who did we

hire today?

ASSISTANT

Thirty blacksmiths, twenty eight

halberdiers, twenty carpenters, a

hundred farmers, twenty miners...

and Doctor Chanca, the royal

surgeon.

COLUMBUS

The royal surgeon?  Then we can

count on royal health!

COLUMBUS

(looking at his son)

He's growing up!

COLUMBUS

Beatrix, I want to ask you

something.

BEATRIX

(with a smile)

You don't usually ask.

COLUMBUS

(after a pause)

I can arrange for the Queen to take

Fernando and Diego into her service.

COLUMBUS

It is a great honor.  We could not

hope for anything better.

BEATRIX

For once I wish you weren't right.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

MOXICA

Is this your new world, Don Colon?

GUEVARA

These animals should be shown what

savagery can be!

NOBLEMAN

Three heads for every life taken.

No mercy before God!

GUEVARA

No mercy!  Let's find them.

COLUMBUS

No Guevara.  There will be no

revenge.

MOXICA

We lost cousins, friends.  We will

wash this in blood.

COLUMBUS

If you want to keep your head on

your shoulders, you'll do as I say.

COLUMBUS

Moxica, I lost friends too... Thirty

nine brave men who trusted me.

COLUMBUS

You want a war?  Fine.  We are a

thousand.  They outnumber us by ten!

Who will you kill?  Which tribe?

MOXICA

We don't need to know.

COLUMBUS

We came here to stay!  To build!

Not to start a crusade.  In this

forest, there is enough danger to

sweep us away in days!  So we will

be brave and swallow our grief.  And

in the name of those who died, we

will accomplish what we came for.

UTAPAN

They here.

COLUMBUS

Ask the Chief what happened to my

men?

UTAPAN

Another tribe made war on them...

came by sea... took them away...

BROTHER BUYL

God have mercy on their souls...

MOXICA

The monkey is lying.

MOXICA

We should kill them, Don Colon.

COLUMBUS

No...!  you'll do it my way.

(to Utapan)

Tell the Chief we will not harm his

people, even though we have the

power to do it.

COLUMBUS

We will work with his people.  We

want peace.  Ask the Chief if he

understands?

UTAPAN

He understands.

COLUMBUS

Ask him if he will help.

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

Don Moxica -- we need your horse.

COLUMBUS

We can't raise the wheel without it.

MOXICA

My horse doesn't work.

COLUMBUS

Don Moxica -- we all have to work.

MOXICA

You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not

my horse.

COLUMBUS

Forgive me, Don Moxica.  But it was

your horse I was talking about.

COLUMBUS

Thank you, Don Moxica.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MOXICA

To the Governor of the Mosquitoes!

MOXICA

Do you want her?

GUEVARA

To the new world, my friend!  To the

new world!

GIACOMO

(as Nima pours the

wine)

Nima's a good cook!

BARTOLOME

She's more than that!

GIACOMO

What is it?

COLUMBUS

Eat!  I'll tell you later.

GIACOMO

I'd like to know what I'm eating.

COLUMBUS

Iguana.

COLUMBUS

What wrong with it?  The Indians eat

it!

GIACOMO

I'm not an Indian.

BARTOLOME

He wishes he were back in the

seminary.  Priests always eat well.

(tasting his wine,

grimacing)

And they have very good cellars.

GIACOMO

Nothing grows here!  Everything rots

in the ground.  The wheat and vines

wither before we can harvest them.

COLUMBUS

We've got to learn to live like the

Indians.

(pause)

Eat your Iguana!

COLUMBUS

How much gold have we found?

BARTOLOME

Not enough to justify a single

shipment.

COLUMBUS

Perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere

but in my imagination.

BARTOLOME

Then let's hope not...

(pause)

What will happen if we can't find

enough gold?

COLUMBUS

(jokingly)

Then I'm Governor of the Mosquitoes.

CUT TO:

BROTHER BUYL

What kind of disease is this?

DOCTOR CHANCA

I don't know.  It seems almost as if

we have exchanged diseases with the

Indians.  They die of our most

common cold, and we of their plague.

BROTHER BUYL

God forgive us!

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

It seems to be caused by intimacy

with the native women, Your Majesty.

ISABEL

Will he survive?

DOCTOR

No, Your Majesty.  They go mad --

then they die.  There is nothing we

can do.

SANCHEZ

Every ship returns with a cargo of

sick and dying.  But with no gold!

The new world proves expensive, Your

Majesty.

ISABEL

We weren't expecting immediate

profits, were we?  We must have

faith.  We must give time for time.

TRANSLATOR

He says he has not found any!

MOXICA

He's lying!

MOXICA

Bring him here!

MOXICA

Tell him to put his hands on the

table.  Like this!

CUT TO:

CLERK

Don Giacomo, you'd better come at

once!

MOXICA

Tell them I want them to watch this!

CLERK

Don't Moxica!  You can't...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MOXICA

(to the clerk)

I can't?  I can't?

COLUMBUS

In one act of brutality, you have

created chaos.  Tribes who were

fighting each other are now joining

forces against us!  All that because

of your criminal savagery!

MOXICA

(casually)

Savagery is what monkeys understand.

COLUMBUS

You'll be held in detention,

deprived of your privileges and

possessions.  Until you are returned

to Spain where you will be judged.

Have you anything to say?

MOXICA

(with exquisite

insolence)

You will regret this.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SOLDIER

(without stopping)

You animals!  Can't you wait!

BARTOLOME

(aggressively)

Moxica is right.  Our ways don't

work!

BARTOLOME

(aggressively)

Can you find them?

COLUMBUS

You have to find them, Utapan.  Look

what they did!

UTAPAN

You did the same to your God!

COLUMBUS

We have to stop this war.

COLUMBUS

Do you know them?

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

Stop!  Stop this!

CUT TO:

GIACOMO

(through cracked

lips)

Moxica...

MOXICA

You know what they will say in Spain

about my death -- don't you?

MOXICA

You are nothing!  You bastards will

never inherit your titles.  We are

everything.  We are immortal!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BROTHER BUYL

I wish to go back with them, Don

Colon.  I have no desire to remain

in this godless place.

COLUMBUS

You may do as you please, Brother

Buyl -- though your departure will

not help me to make it more Godly.

BROTHER BUYL

You treat Christians equally with

heathen savages.  You execute

members of the nobility.  And what

do you offer in return?

COLUMBUS

(quietly)

A new world, Brother Buyl.

BROTHER BUYL

Nobody wants one...!  Only you!

COLUMBUS

Perhaps hope only exists in the

journey.  When it begins, everything

is still possible -- every

expectation; every dream...

COLUMBUS

This is not how I imagined it to be.

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

Utapan!

COLUMBUS

Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You

used to know how to speak to me.

UTAPAN

(sadly, in his own

language)

You never learned how to speak my

language.

INDIANS

Urracan... Urracan... Urracan...

Urracan...

(the wrath of God)

COLUMBUS

(screaming)

Let it go!  Let it go!

CUT TO:

SANCHEZ (V.O.)

He promised us gold but has failed

to find it.  He subjects the natives

to violence, provocation and

injustice.  He sent them to Spain

against the express wishes of Your

Majesty...

SANCHEZ

... But there is worse.  He ordered

the execution of five members of the

nobility...

ISABEL

Is this true, Brother Buyl?

BROTHER BUYL

Yes, Your Majesty.  It is all true.

I saw it with my own eyes.

ISABEL

Then, what do you suggest, Don

Sanchez?

SANCHEZ

He must be replaced.

ISABEL

And who would you think of, for such

a task?

CUT TO:

SANCHEZ (V.O.)

I am thinking of a man.  A devotee

to Your Majesties.  A man extremely

motivated...

DISSOLVE TO:

BOBADILLA

Don Alonso de Bobadilla.

COLUMBUS

Yes... I remember...

BOBADILLA

My letters of appointment.

COLUMBUS

Appointment to what?

BOBADILLA

Viceroy of the West Indies.

COLUMBUS

Congratulations.  Then I am free to

search for the mainland.

BOBADILLA

Didn't you learn?  The mainland was

discovered.  Weeks ago.  By another

Italian.  I forgot his name.

A MAN IN BLACK

Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency.

COLUMBUS

How far from here?

BOBADILLA

I am not a seaman.  But I heard it

is no more than a week at sea.  I

hope you are not too disappointed.

COLUMBUS

How could I be?  The mainland has

been found.  Exactly as I said it

would.

BOBADILLA

I am afraid this is not the worst

news.

CUT TO:

FERNANDO

(quietly)

Father?

COLUMBUS

Fernando...!  My God...!

COLUMBUS

A man!  Diego, how did this happen?

DIEGO

Santangel is going to see the Queen.

We are going to get you out of here.

COLUMBUS

Good!  I have to go back!

DIEGO

Go back?

COLUMBUS

I have to explore the mainland.

FERNANDO

This time with me!

DIEGO

In your present state it is madness,

Father!

FERNANDO

Nobody is forcing you to come with

us.

DIEGO

I can't go anyway.

FERNANDO

She's very beautiful!  The Queen has

very good taste.  Diego is getting

married.

COLUMBUS

I am happy for you, Diego.

SANTANGEL

Granted his faults.  Yes, a hundred

times!  But the man is still

remarkable.

SANTANGEL

All he asks is a chance to explore

this... mainland.

SANCHEZ

It does not belong to him.

SANTANGEL

(quietly)

In a way, it does, Don Sanchez.

(to the Queen)

I beg Your Majesty to receive him.

To hear him... He will make no more

demands.  He has changed.  He is

penitent.

SANCHEZ

Penitent...?  He is suing us for

breach of contract!

ISABEL

Is he?

ISABEL

Really?

ISABEL

Rise... Please...

COLUMBUS

Now I do look older than you.

ISABEL

We have decided to allow you to

undertake another voyage to the new

world...

ISABEL

But without your brothers.  Nor are

you to return to Santo Domingo or

any of the other colonies.  You may

explore the continent.

COLUMBUS

Thank you.

ISABEL

There is one thing I'd like to

understand... Why do you want to go

back, after all this?

COLUMBUS

Your Majesty -- some men are content

to read about things.  I must see

them with my own eyes.  I cannot be

other than I am.

ISABEL

I know, I should not tolerate his

impertinence.

SANCHEZ

Then why?

ISABEL

Because he is not afraid of me.

SANCHEZ

All I have to do is call the guards.

COLUMBUS

Call them.

SANCHEZ

I am not afraid of you.  You are

nothing but a dreamer.

COLUMBUS

Look out of that window.

COLUMBUS

What do you see?

SANCHEZ

Roofs... towers, palaces...

spires...

COLUMBUS

All of them created by people like

me.

COLUMBUS

No matter how long you live,

Sanchez, there's something that will

never change between us.  I did it!

You didn't!

COLUMBUS

God... you're so beautiful!  I can't

believe no other man has ever taken

you away from me...

BEATRIX

They tried... but I didn't let them.

BEATRIX

They took everything...

COLUMBUS

(looking at her)

Not everything... Do you think I

care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches

don't make a man rich, they only

make him busier...

COLUMBUS

God, how much I've missed you!

CUT TO:

SANTANGEL (O.S.)

One chair.  One table.  What more

can a man expect, when he tries to

sue the Crown?

COLUMBUS

I owe you everything, Santangel...

but as you see, I can't repay you.

SANTANGEL

On the contrary.  It is I who owe

you everything.  Through you, I have

been an adventurer, an explorer!

It's true I shall never see the new

world... but it's here...

(he points to his

head)

And here...

(pointing to his

heart)

SANTANGEL

What you are, Colon, is a sailor, a

discoverer, a man of imagination...

not a politician.  You weren't meant

to govern -- You cannot be all

things to all men.

SANTANGEL

I wish you could have compromised.

It would have made your life

easier...

COLUMBUS

But as least we haven't been bored,

have we?

SAILOR'S VOICE

West... southwest, Captain Mendez...

MENDEZ (O.S.)

Steady as she goes...

COLUMBUS

How are you feeling, Fernando?

FERNANDO

(in a strangled

voice)

Not bad.

COLUMBUS

(almost casually)

You know what I always used to do?

COLUMBUS

Swallow a piece of pork fat on a

string.  It always worked.

SAILOR (O.S.)

Tierra...!  Tierra!

COLUMBUS

The mainland...

MENDEZ

What's he doing?

COLUMBUS

He's drawing an isthmus... He's

saying we're on an isthmus.

MENDEZ

We can't be.

COLUMBUS

Tell me what he's saying.

TRANSLATOR

He says -- water on the other side.

COLUMBUS

Ask him if he means a lake.  A big

lake.

TRANSLATOR

No.  Says those are lakes.  Water on

other side big -- as wide as here.

Above and below, much land.

COLUMBUS

(stunned)

An ocean...?  He's says it's an

ocean?

FERNANDO

I don't understand.

COLUMBUS

Here is Europe... and over here, the

continent of Asia.  But there's

something in between!  Another

continent!  We've found... another

continent!

FERNANDO

Father...

COLUMBUS

There must be a passage to that

other ocean.

CUT TO:

TRANSLATOR

I help.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FERNANDO

Oh my God...

COLUMBUS

(approaching)

What is...?

SOLDIER

Oh Virgen Maria... Oh Madre de

Dios...

(Oh Virgin Mary... Oh Mother of

God...)

SOLDIER

Jesus, Maria, y todos los Santos...

(Jesus, Mary, and all the Saints...)

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

(urgently)

Out!  Get out!

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

(kindly)

Take it.  Come on.  Drink.

COLUMBUS

I... I have to see Mendez.

COLUMBUS

Your brother was right.  I should

have never taken you with me.  I'll

never forgive myself.  Never!

COLUMBUS

Will you ever forgive me?

COLUMBUS

Captain Mendez!

CUT TO:

COLUMBUS

I came to Your Highness with honest

purpose and sincere zeal.  I did not

undertake these voyages for honor or

wealth -- that is certain.  After

years of service to the Crown, I do

not have a roof to put over my

head... Your Majesty allowed me to

explore the continent, believed to

be Asia.  I now believe that it is

an new Land, of unknown proportions

and wealth... Life has more

imagination than we carry in our

dreams...

DISSOLVE TO:

DUENA

"I should be judged as a Seaman who

by Divine Will discovered a New

World, and thereby placed it under

the sovereignty of Your Majesties.

I humbly beseech Your Majesties that

if it pleases God to remove me

hence, you will help the name of

Columbus to be remembered with

honor... Weep for me, whoever has

charity, truth and justice."

AROJAZ (O.S.)

The sunset route to the new

continent is now well-established...

AROJAZ

... West by south west for 750

leagues to Santo Domingo.  From

there, west north west, leaving San

Juan to the north, reaching the

island of Hispanola on the northern

cape of San Raphael... Then onto the

mainland, at the Cape called Gracias

a Dios...

AROJAZ

Spain -- by Your Majesty's grace --

has confirmed for all humanity the

existence of an unknown continent...

Tierra Incognita...

AROJAZ

... This continent was first

discovered by a sailor commissioned

by your Majesty...

AROJAZ

His name... Amerigo Vespucci...

CUT TO:

AROJAZ

My God...!  I thought he was dead.

SANCHEZ

You can see for yourself.

AROJAZ

What a tragedy... what a waste of a

life...

SANCHEZ

A waste...?  Let me tell you

something, Arojaz.  If your name, or

mine, is ever remembered -- it will

only be because of his.

MARCHENA

I suppose we're both old men now.

COLUMBUS

You'll always be older than me,

Father.

COLUMBUS

Have you ever forgiven me?

MARCHENA

Yes.  I forgave you a long time ago.

You see, I was proud of you.  You

were like a willful child.  You

wouldn't accept what others told

you.  You had to find things out for

yourself, hurting yourself -- and

others -- in the process.

MARCHENA

Do you remember when you said that

people talk about the world, but

never leave their gardens.

MARCHENA

More than ever I wonder what it is

we do achieve by leaving our

gardens... The world changes -- and

yet it seems the same.  We find new

worlds, but fill them with the same

people...

COLUMBUS

I have to disagree.

MARCHENA

I knew you would.

COLUMBUS

New worlds create new people.

MARCHENA

Oh?  So you are a new man?

COLUMBUS

I don't know... I have the

impression that I didn't change that

much.  I still can't accept the

world as it is!

MARCHENA

God bless you, and those like you!

COLUMBUS

Can't you stay with us a little?

BEATRIX

I am busy inside.

BEATRIX

What is it, now?  Tell me...

COLUMBUS

I can't keep my eyes off you.  I

would like to catch up with all the

moments I didn't spend with you.

COLUMBUS

What are you listening to?

FERNANDO

I am not listening, Father.  But I

can't help hearing.

FERNANDO

It's Diego... He is at the Court,

with Santangel... He says they hope

to get your privileges restored...

And maybe the house.

COLUMBUS

But how is he?  And Dona Maria?

FERNANDO

Fine, it seems.  Diego is thinking

of starting a pearl trade, in Santo

Domingo... He says he received many

letters for you.  Some of your men,

mostly.

FERNANDO

This one is from Mendez!

COLUMBUS

What does he say?

FERNANDO

He asks when he can come to visit

you.  He left his address.

COLUMBUS

(smiling)

He never had one... except aboard my

ships!

FERNANDO

I want you to tell me everything you

remember, Father.  From the

beginning.  Everything.

COLUMBUS

Really?

(pause)

God... I wouldn't know where to

start... and yet...

FERNANDO

Tell me the first thing that comes

to your mind.

COLUMBUS

I remember...
