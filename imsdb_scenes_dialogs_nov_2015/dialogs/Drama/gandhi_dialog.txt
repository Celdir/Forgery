GANDHI

Written by

John Briley

Final Draft

HOUSE SERVANT'S VOICE

He will be saying prayers in the

garden -- just follow the others.

MANU

(gently)

Brother -- Bapu is already late for

prayers.

GANDHI

Oh, God... oh, God...

MURROW

(clipped, weighted)

...The object of this massive tribute

died as he had always lived -- a

private man without wealth, without

property, without official title or

office...

MURROW'S VOICE-OVER

Mahatma Gandhi was not a commander

of great armies nor ruler of vast

lands, he could boast no scientific

achievements, no artistic gift...

Yet men, governments and dignitaries

from all over the world have joined

hands today to pay homage to this

little brown man in the loincloth

who led his country to freedom...

MURROW'S VOICE-OVER

Pope Pius, the Archbishop of

Canterbury, President Truman, Chiang

Kai-shek, The Foreign Minister of

Russia, the President of France...

are among the millions here and abroad

who have lamented his passing. In

the words of General George C.

Marshall, the American Secretary of

State, "Mahatma Gandhi had become

the spokesman for the conscience of

mankind..."

MURROW'S VOICE-OVER

...a man who made humility and simple

truth more powerful than empires."

And Albert Einstein added,

"Generations to come will scarce

believe that such a one as this ever

in flesh and blood walked upon this

earth."

MURROW'S VOICE-OVER

... but perhaps to this man of peace,

to this fighter who fought without

malice or falsehood or hate, the

tribute he would value most has come

from General Douglas McArthur: "If

civilization is to survive," the

General said this morning, "all men

cannot fail to adopt Gandhi's belief

that the use of force to resolve

conflict is not only wrong but

contains within itself the germ of

our own self-destruction."...

MURROW'S VOICE-OVER

Perhaps for the rest of us, the most

satisfying comment on this tragedy

comes from the impudent New York PM

which today wrote, "There is still

hope for a world which reacts as

reverently as ours has to the death

of a man like Gandhi."...

GANDHI

Tell me -- do you think about hell?

PORTER

(stares at him blankly)

"Hell!"

GANDHI

(the eternal, earnest

sophomore)

No -- neither do I. But...

(he points abruptly

to the book)

but this man is a Christian and he

has written --

PORTER

Excuse me, baas, but how long have

you been in South Africa?

GANDHI

(puzzled)

A -- a week.

PORTER

Well, I don't know how you got a

ticket for --

CONDUCTOR

Here -- coolie, just what are you

doing in this car?

GANDHI

Why -- I -- I have a ticket. A First

Class ticket.

CONDUCTOR

How did you get hold of it?

GANDHI

I sent for it in the post. I'm an

attorney, and I didn't have time to --

EUROPEAN

There are no colored attorneys in

South Africa. Go and sit where you

belong.

PORTER

I'll take your luggage back, baas.

GANDHI

No, no -- just a moment, please.

GANDHI

You see, Mohandas K. Gandhi, Attorney

at Law. I am going to Pretoria to

conduct a case for an Indian trading

firm.

EUROPEAN

Didn't you hear me? There are no

colored attorneys in South Africa!

GANDHI

Sir, I was called to the bar in London

and enrolled in the High Court of

Chancery -- I am therefore an

attorney, and since I am -- in your

eyes -- colored -- I think we can

deduce that there is at least one

colored attorney in South Africa.

EUROPEAN

Smart bloody kaffir -- throw him

out!

CONDUCTOR

You move your damn sammy carcass

back to third class or I'll have you

thrown off at the next station.

GANDHI

(anger, a touch of

panic)

I always go First Class! I have

traveled all over England and I've

never...

GANDHI

But you're a rich man -- why do you

put up with it?

KHAN

(a shrug)

I'm rich -- but I'm Indian. I

therefore do not expect to travel

First Class.

GANDHI

In England, I was a poor student but

I --

KHAN

That was England.

GANDHI

This part of "England's" Empire!

SINGH

Mr. Gandhi, you look at Mr. Khan and

see a successful Muslim trader. The

South Africans see him simply as an

Indian. And the vast majority of

Indians -- mostly Hindu like yourself --

(there is a moment of

blinking embarrassment

from Gandhi at this

mention of his own

religion)

were brought here to work the mines

and harvest the crops -- and the

Europeans don't want them doing

anything else.

GANDHI

But that is very un-Christian.

TYEB MOHAMMED

Mr. Gandhi, in this country Indians

are not allowed to walk along a

pavement with a "Christian"!

GANDHI

You mean you employ Mr. Baker as

your attorney, but you can't walk

down the street with him?

KHAN

I can. But I risk being kicked into

the gutter by someone less "holy"

than Mr. Baker.

GANDHI

Well, then, it must be fought. We

are children of God like everyone

else.

KHAN

(dryly)

Allah be praised. And what battalions

will you call upon?

GANDHI

I -- I will write to the press --

here -- and in England.

(He turns to Baker

firmly)

And I will use the courts.

SINGH

You will make a lot of trouble.

GANDHI

We are members of the Empire. And we

come from an ancient civilization.

Why should we not walk on the

pavements like other men?

KHAN

I rather like the idea of an Indian

barrister in South Africa. I'm sure

our community could keep you in work

for some time, Mr. Gandhi -- even if

you caused a good deal of trouble.

(Gandhi reacts

uncertainly.)

Especially if you caused a good deal

of trouble.

GANDHI

There's the English reporter. I told

you he'd come.

KHAN

You also said your article would

draw a thousand people.

(If the crowd numbers

100 they're lucky.)

At least some of the Hindus brought

their wives.

GANDHI

No. I asked my wife to organize that.

SINGH

(alarmed)

Some of them are leaving...

GANDHI

Ladies and Gentlemen, we have asked

you to gather here to help us proclaim

our right to be treated as equal

citizens of the Empire.

GANDHI

We do not seek conflict. We know the

strength of the forces arrayed against

us, know that because of them we can

only use peaceful means -- but we

are determined that justice will be

done!

GANDHI

The symbol of our status is embodied

in this pass -- which we must carry

at all times, but no European even

has to have.

GANDHI

And the first step to changing our

status is to eliminate this difference

between us.

KHAN

(quietly)

You write brilliantly, but you have

much to learn about handling men.

KHAN

(the reading not

fluent, but firm and

pointed)

We do not want to ignite... the fear

or hatred of anyone. But we ask you --

Hindu, Muslim and Sikh -- to help us

light up the sky... and the minds of

the British authorities -- with our

defiance of this injustice.

KHAN

We will now burn the passes of our

committee and its supporters. We ask

you to put your passes on the fire

with --

POLICE SERGEANT

Oh, no, you bloody well don't!

POLICE SERGEANT

Those passes are government property!

And I will arrest the first man who

tries to burn one!

POLICE SERGEANT

Take him away!

POLICE SERGEANT

Now -- are there any more?!

POLICE SERGEANT

You little sammy bastard -- I --

POLICE SERGEANT

You want that kind of trouble -- you

can have it!

BA

Let me go!

SERGEANT

Stop!

GANDHI

You saved the papers.

BA

I wish you were still struggling for

work in Bombay.

GANDHI

I hated that -- all the pettiness,

the little corruptions.

(A reflective grin.)

And I was more laughing stock than

lawyer.

GANDHI

But they needed me here. If I'd never

been thrown off that train, perhaps

no one would ever have needed me.

GANDHI

(reading)

"A high court judge has confirmed

that Mr. Gandhi would have been within

his rights to prosecute for assault

since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted

arrest." -- I told you about English

law.

BA

As I told you about English policemen.

GANDHI

Yes?

HARILAL

We are glad to have you back, Bapu.

GANDHI

And I am glad to be back.

(He holds his hands

out to Ramdas.)

Come...

BA

Be careful!

GANDHI

Tomorrow I will tell you what it

feels like to be a jailbird.

AYAH

Come. Come.

GANDHI

Just like proper English gentlemen.

I'm proud of them.

BA

They are boys. -- And they're Indian.

GANDHI

Hm. Will you take this off?

(he touches the bandage

on his cheek)

It pinches every time I speak.

GANDHI

Here, you see? Even the South African

papers apologize -- "a monstrous

attack."

BA

(of the tape, as she

is about to pull it)

Are you sure?

GANDHI

(impatiently)

Yes -- I can't talk like this.

GANDHI

Pull!

GANDHI

Oww!

BA

(mockingly)

Mr. Khan said they called you brave.

GANDHI

If you would let me teach you to

read, you could see for yourself.

BA

I could have told them you were merely

foolish.

GANDHI

It proves what I told you. If I had

prosecuted him as everyone advised --

even you -- they would have hated me --

by showing forgiveness I -- ouch!

BA

There...

GANDHI

(as though continuing

the argument)

You see there is such a thing as

moral force -- and it can be

harnessed.

BA

Not always. You have told me twice

now that you were giving up the

pleasures of the flesh.

GANDHI

I am. I am convinced the holy men

are right. When you give up, you

gain. The simpler your life the

better.

GANDHI

I will fast tomorrow -- as a penance.

BA

If you enjoy it a great deal you

must fast for two days.

TALL CIVIL SERVANT

The London papers have arrived from

the Cape, sir.

SMUTS

Yes -- ?

TALL CIVIL SERVANT

The worst was the Daily Mail, sir.

They said, "The burning of passes by

Mr. Gandhi was the most significant

act in colonial affairs since the

Declaration of Independence."

SMUTS

Did they? Well, they'll find we're a

little better prepared this time.

Mr. Gandhi will find he's on a long

hiding to nothing.

CHARLIE

You'd be Gandhi --

(Gandhi nods.)

...I thought you'd be bigger.

GANDHI

I'm sorry.

CHARLIE

I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't

matter.

(He suddenly steps

forward and thrusts

out his hand.)

I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie

Andrews. I've come from India --

I've read a great deal about you.

GANDHI

Some of it good, I hope.

GANDHI

(to Charlie)

Would you care to walk?

GANDHI

(noting Charlie's

collar)

You're a clergyman.

CHARLIE

Yes. I've -- I've met some very

remarkable people in India... and --

and when I read what you've been

doing here, I -- I wanted to help.

(He looks at Gandhi,

then smiles awkwardly.)

Does that surprise you?

GANDHI

Not anymore.

(And now he smiles.)

At first I was amazed... but when

you are fighting in a just cause,

people seem to pop up -- like you --

right out of the pavement. Even when

it is dangerous or --

FIRST YOUTH

Hey -- look what's comin'!

SECOND YOUTH

A white shepherd leading a brown

sammy!

CHARLIE

Perhaps I should --

GANDHI

Doesn't the New Testament say, "If

your enemy strikes you on the right

cheek, offer him the left"?

CHARLIE

I think perhaps the phrase was used

metaphorically... I don't think our

Lord meant --

GANDHI

I'm not so certain. I have thought

about it a great deal. I suspect he

meant you must show courage -- be

willing to take a blow -- several

blows -- to show you will not strike

back -- nor will you be turned

aside... And when --

GANDHI

...and when you do that it calls

upon something in human nature --

something that makes his hate for

you diminish and his respect increase.

I think Christ grasped that and I --

I have seen it work.

GANDHI

Good morning.

FIRST YOUTH

Get off the pavement, you bloody --

A WOMAN'S VOICE

Colin! Colin! What are you doing?

FIRST YOUTH

Nuthing... nuthing. We were just

cleaning up the neighborhood a little.

COLIN'S MOTHER

You're already late for work. I

thought you'd gone ten minutes ago.

GANDHI

You'll find there's room for us both.

CHARLIE

(relieved)

That was lucky.

GANDHI

I thought you were a man of God.

CHARLIE

(wittily, but making

his point)

I am. But I'm not so egotistical as

to think He plans His day around my

dilemmas.

GANDHI

...you could call it a "communal

farm," I suppose. But we've all come

to the same conclusion -- our Gita,

the Muslim's Koran or your Bible --

it's always the simple things that

catch your breath -- "Love thy

neighbor as thyself" --

(He smiles, thinking

back at the youths.)

not always practiced -- but it's

something we Hindus could learn a

lot from.

CHARLIE

That's the sort of thing you'll be

seeking on this "farm"...

GANDHI

(a smile)

Well, we shall try.

SONJA

They're going to change the pass

laws.

SMUTS'S VOICE-OVER

It's taken time, but it needed to be

done fairly. We didn't want to create

an injustice simply because Mr. Gandhi

was abusing our existing legislation.

SECOND VOICE

Just one second, sir, please.

SMUTS

But on a short trip, I wouldn't spend

too much time on the Indian question,

Mr. Walker. It's a tiny factor in

South African life.

WALKER

(a helpless shrug)

It's news at the moment. I will

certainly report on your mines and

the economy -- but I would like to

meet this Mr. Gandhi.

SMUTS

Of course. We Westerners have a

weakness for these -- these

spiritually inclined men of India.

But as an old lawyer, let me warn

you, Mr. Gandhi is as shrewd a man

as you will ever meet, however

"otherworldly" he may seem. But I'm

sure you're enough of a reporter to

see that.

GANDHI

...so it's not "spiritualism" or

"nationalism" -- we're not against

anything but the idea that people

can't live together.

GANDHI

You see -- Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs,

Jews -- even Christians.

GANDHI

Mr. Walker! Of The New York Times!

GANDHI

Without a paper -- a journal of some

kind -- you cannot unite a community.

(A teasing smile.)

You belong to a very important

profession.

WALKER

Hm. And what should an "important

professional" write about your

response to General Smuts's new

legislation?

GANDHI

I don't know... I'm still searching

for a "response."

WALKER

(a leading question)

You will respect the law.

GANDHI

(a beat)

There are unjust laws -- as there

are unjust men.

WALKER

You're a very small minority to take

on the Government -- and the Empire.

GANDHI

If you are a minority of one, the

truth is the truth.

GANDHI

This is Mr. Kallenbach. He is our

chief carpenter -- and also our chief

benefactor. He has made this

experiment possible.

WALKER

Well, it's quite a place, your

"ashram" -- is that right?

GANDHI

That's right. The word only means

"community." But it could stand for

"village"... or the world.

WALKER

You're an ambitious man.

GANDHI

(uncertainly)

I hope not.

WALKER

They tell me you also take your turn

at peeling potatoes and cleaning the

"outhouse" -- is that part of the

experiment?

GANDHI

(a little surprised,

a little annoyed)

Ba -- we will need another place set

for Mr. Walker's driver.

BA

I will tell Sora.

GANDHI

It's one way to learn that each man's

labor is as important as another's.

In fact when you're doing it,

"cleaning the outhouse" seems far

more important than the law.

GANDHI

Please come and join us -- you'll

need something before your journey

back.

(He nods to Walker.)

Excuse me a moment.

GANDHI

What is it?

BA

Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must

rake and cover the latrine.

GANDHI

Everyone takes his turn.

BA

It is the work of untouchables.

GANDHI

In this place there are no

untouchables -- and no work is beneath

any of us!

BA

(she looks up at him)

I am your wife.

GANDHI

All the more reason.

BA

(finally, scornfully)

As you command.

BA

The others may follow you -- but you

forget, I knew you when you were a

boy!

GANDHI

It's not me. It's the principle. And

you will do it with joy or not do it

at all!

BA

Not at all then...

GANDHI

All right, go! You don't belong here!

Go! Leave the ashram! Get out

altogether! We don't want you!

BA

Stop it! Stop it! What are you doing!?

BA

(bitterly)

Have you no shame? I'm your wife...

(Like lead)

Where do you expect me to go?

GANDHI

What is the matter with me...?

BA

(a beat)

You are human -- only human.

BA

And it is even harder for those of

us who do not even want to be as

good as you do.

GANDHI

I apologize...

GANDHI

I must go back to that reporter.

BA

...And I must rake and cover the

latrine.

GANDHI

(to the house)

I want to welcome you all!

GANDHI

Every one of you.

(Then, still at them)

We -- have -- no -- secrets.

GANDHI

Let us begin by being clear about

General Smuts's new law. All Indians

must now be fingerprinted -- like

criminals. Men and women.

(A rising, angry

response; Gandhi

just waits.)

No marriage other than a Christian

marriage is considered valid. Under

this Act our wives and mothers are

whores... And every man here a

bastard.

KHAN

He's become quite good at this.

GANDHI

And a policeman passing an Indian

dwelling -- I will not call them

homes -- may enter and demand the

card or any Indian woman whose

dwelling it is.

A VOICE

God damn them!

GANDHI

Understand! He does not have to stand

at the door -- he may enter.

MERCHANT

I swear to Allah I will kill the man

who offers that insult to my home

and my wife!

(A guttural cheer; he

glares at the police.)

And let them hang me!

TYEB MOHAMMED

I say talk means nothing. Kill a few

officials before they disgrace one

Indian woman -- then they might think

twice about such laws!

TYEB MOHAMMED'S FRIEND

In that cause, I would be willing to

die!

GANDHI

I praise such courage. I need such

courage -- because in this cause, I

too am prepared to die...

(A response; he looks

at Tyeb Mohammed)

But, my friend, there is no cause

for which I am prepared to kill.

GANDHI

I have asked you here tonight because

despite all their troops and police,

I think there is a way to defeat

this law. Whatever they do to us we

will attack no one, kill no one...

But we will not

(the climatic point)

give our fingerprints -- not one of

us.

GANDHI

They will imprison us, they will

fine us. They will seize our

possessions. But they cannot take

away our self-respect if we do not

give it to them.

VOICE FROM THE GALLERY

Have you been to prison? They'll

beat us and torture us! I say --

GANDHI

I am asking you to fight -- !

(It catches the

audience a little,

holds them.)

To fight against their anger -- not

to provoke it!

GANDHI

We will not strike a blow -- but we

will receive them. And through our

pain we will make them see their

injustice

(quickly)

and it will hurt, as all fighting

hurts!

(Utter silence.)

...But we cannot lose. We cannot.

(He looks down at the

police.)

Because they may torture my body,

may break my bones, even kill me...

(Up to the house)

They will then have my dead body --

not my obedience.

GANDHI

We are Hindu and Muslim -- children

of God, each of us. Let us take a

solemn oath in His name that -- come

what may -- we will not submit to

this law.

GANDHI

(a coarse singing)

God save our gracious King... Long

live our

(the audience takes

it up)

...noble King.

(And their voices

fill the auditorium)

God save the King!!

CIVILIAN

These men are contracted laborers.

They belong in the mines.

GANDHI

You have put their comrades in jail.

When you free them they will go back

to work.

CIVILIAN

I've warned you.

GANDHI

We have warned each other.

SINGH

I don't think that is very good.

SERGEANT

At the canter -- for-ward!

MINER

(half to Gandhi)

We should lie down -- the horses

won't tramp on us.

(Then shouting out)

Down! Down! Everyone lie down!

GANDHI

Lie down! Lie down!

MINER

The horses have more mercy than the

men.

SERGEANT

You're right!

GANDHI

Lie down! Lie down!

SERGEANT

Follow me!

SERGEANT

What the hell are we supposed to do

now?

CIVILIAN

(watching the

procession narrowly)

Let them march... In our own sweet

time, in our own sweet way -- we'll

get them.

CHARLIE

Some of you may be rejoicing that

Mr. Gandhi has at last been put into

prison.

CHARLIE

But I would ask you -- assembled

here in this house of God -- to

recognize that we are witnessing

something new, something so

unexpected, so unusual that it is

not surprising the Government is at

a loss. What Mr. Gandhi has forced

us to do is ask questions about

ourselves.

CHARLIE

As Christians, those are difficult

questions to answer. How do we treat

men who defy an unjust law -- men

who will not fight, but will not

comply?

GANDHI

They're sparing no one, I see.

KHAN

No. You were the surprise. It's been

all over the prison. We thought they'd

be too afraid of the English press.

GANDHI

So did I.

KHAN

(acidly)

Don't worry about the meat -- it's

Hindu

(referring to the

soup)

-- there's not a trace.

KHAN

I don't know who they've left out

there to do the work. There can't be

one mine left open. Have they touched

the women?

GANDHI

My wife publicly defied the law.

They've arrested her and four others.

KHAN

(angrily)

The fools!

(He spills some soup.)

Sorry...

GANDHI

It's split the Government.

KHAN

Well, that's one victory.

GANDHI

If we hold firm, it won't be the

last.

KHAN

Don't worry -- I've never seen men

so determined. You've given them a

way to fight... And I don't think --

PRISON OFFICER

Gandhi! I want Gandhi! Which sammy

is it?

SMUTS

Ah, Mr. Gandhi. I thought we might

have a little talk.

SMUTS

Will you have a glass of sherry?

GANDHI

Thank you. No.

SMUTS

Perhaps some tea?

GANDHI

(a shake of the head)

I dined at the prison.

SMUTS

Ahh.

SMUTS

Please -- please do come and sit

down. It's prison I wanted to talk

to you about.

SMUTS

Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided

to ask the House to repeal the Act

that you have taken such "exception"

to.

GANDHI

(a beat)

Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm

sure it will be done.

SMUTS

Hm. Of course it is not quite that

simple.

GANDHI

Somehow I expected not.

SMUTS

I'm glad to hear you say that...

very glad. You see if we repeal the

Act under pressure

(a nod at the papers

again)

under this kind of pressure it will

create a great deal of resentment.

Can you understand that?

GANDHI

Very well.

SMUTS

(a bit surprised)

Good. Good.

(The bland politician:

the compromise.)

I have thought of calling for a Royal

Commission to "investigate" the new

legislation.

(He gestures, implying

they'll do what

they're told.)

I think I could guarantee they would

recommend the Act be repealed.

GANDHI

(waiting for the catch)

I congratulate them.

SMUTS

But they might also recommend that

future Indian immigration be severely

restricted -- even stopped.

GANDHI

Immigration was not an issue on which

we fought. It would be wrong of us

to make it one now that we -- we are

in a position of advantage.

SMUTS

You're an extraordinary man.

GANDHI

(his grin; he brushes

at his prison garb)

I assure you I feel a very ordinary

man at this moment.

SMUTS

I'm ordering the release of all

prisoners within the next twenty-

four hours. You yourself are free

from this moment.

SMUTS

Assuming we are in agreement?

GANDHI

Yes -- yes. It's just that... in

these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to

go by taxi.

SMUTS

(confused by his

hesitation)

All right. Fine.

GANDHI

I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.

SMUTS

Oh!

(He quickly feels in

his waistcoat pockets --

and realizes he has

no money!)

Neither have I.

(He reaches forth and

touches a buzzer.)

I'm awfully sorry.

SMUTS

Daniels, would you lend Mr. Gandhi a

shilling for a taxi?

DANIELS

I beg your pardon, sir?

SMUTS

(a second thought)

How far will you be going, Mr. Gandhi?

GANDHI

(a mischievous smile)

Well -- now that this is settled --

I had thought seriously of going

back to India

(he faces the startled

Daniel)

but a shilling will do splendidly

for the moment.

GANDHI

Thank you.

(To Smuts)

Thank you both for a very enlightening

experience.

GANDHI

(ice)

I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels, but I will

find my own way out.

SMUTS

(a shake of the head)

He's either a great man or a colossal

fraud... Either way, I shall be glad

to see the last of him.

YOUNG ENGLISHMAN

By God, he loves it...

SECOND ENGLISHMAN

I'm sure he hates it.

SECOND ENGLISHMAN

Generals' reputations are being made

in France today, fighting on the

Western Front. Not as Military

Governors in India.

SECOND ENGLISHMAN

What the devil's going on back there?

YOUNG ENGLISHMAN

It must be that Indian that made all

that fuss back in Africa. My cabin

boy told me he was on board.

SECOND ENGLISHMAN

Why haven't we seen him?

(Finding the name)

Gandhi?

YOUNG ENGLISHMAN

Yes. That's it. He was traveling

Third Class. There he is.

SECOND ENGLISHMAN'S VOICE-OVER

God -- he's dressed like a coolie! I

thought he was a lawyer.

YOUNG ENGLISHMAN

After he came out of jail he refused

to wear European clothes.

GANDHI

No, no, I haven't "refused"... I --

I simply wanted to dress the way my

comrades in prison dressed.

ENGLISH JOURNALIST

Will you support the war effort, Mr.

Gandhi?

GANDHI

I -- I have demanded rights as a

British citizen, it is therefore my

duty to help in the defense of the

British Empire.

AMERICAN REPORTER

What are you going to do now that

you're back in India?

GANDHI

I don't know... I don't know...

SECOND INDIAN REPORTER

As an Indian woman how could you

accept the indignity of prison?

NEHRU

Please, Mr. Gandhi.

BA

My dignity comes from following my

husband.

NEHRU

(he too speaks with

an Oxbridge accent)

Just a few words -- then we'll get

you to civilization.

GANDHI

I -- I am glad to be home.

(A little round of

applause.)

I -- I thank you for your greeting.

NEHRU

We'll follow with your wife -- don't

worry, everything's arranged.

GANDHI

Who is that young man?

PATEL

That's young Nehru. He's got his

father's intellect, his mother's

looks and the devil's charm. If they

don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave!

Wave! -- he may amount to something.

PATEL

I must say when I first saw you as a

bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I

never thought I'd be greeting you as

a national hero.

GANDHI

I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.

PATEL

Oh, yes, you are. It's been two

hundred years since an Indian has

cocked a snoot at the British Empire

and got away with it. And stop calling

me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior

clerk anymore.

GANDHI

(a beat; still hesitant)

No.

PATEL

The new Military Governor of the

North West Province was on that ship.

Too bad you came back Third Class --

he might have been impressed by a

successful barrister who had

outmaneuvered General Smuts.

GANDHI

(leadenly)

Yes... I'm sure...

MRS. NEHRU

(wittily)

No, I leave practical matters to my

husband and revolution to my son...

NEHRU

Mr. Jinnah, our joint host, member

of Congress, and the leader of the

Muslim League and Mr. Prakash, who I

fear is awaiting trial for sedition

and inducement to murder.

PRAKASH

I have not actually pulled a trigger,

Mr. Gandhi, I have simply written

that if an Englishman kills an Indian

for disobeying his law, then it is

an Indian's duty to kill an Englishman

for enforcing his law in a land that

is not his.

GANDHI

It is a clever argument; I am not

sure it will produce the end you

desire.

JINNAH

(testingly)

We hope you intend to join us in the

struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.

GANDHI

(a pause)

I --

CHARLIE

May I? Mohan -- I would like you to

meet someone.

NEHRU

He told the press he would support

the British in the war.

PRAKASH

(acidly)

That's non-violence for you.

JINNAH

Is he a fool?

NEHRU

I'm not certain... But I wouldn't be

surprised.

CHARLIE

I lied to you, Mohan, when I told

you I decided to come to South Africa

to meet you. Professor Gokhale sent

me.

GOKHALE

We're trying to make a nation, Gandhi --

and the British keep trying to break

us up into religions and

principalities and "provinces." What

you were writing in South Africa --

that's what we need here.

GANDHI

(a smile)

I have much to learn about India.

And I have to begin my practice again --

one needs money to run a journal.

GOKHALE

Nonsense.

(He turns to Charlie)

Go on, Charlie. This is Indian talk --

we want none of you imperialists.

CHARLIE

(a mock threat)

All right -- I'll go and write my

report to the Viceroy.

GOKHALE

Go and find a pretty Hindu woman and

convert her to Christianity -- that's

as much mischief as you're allowed.

GOKHALE

Forget your practice. India has many

men with too much wealth -- it is

their privilege to nourish the efforts

of the few who can raise India from

servitude and apathy. I will see to

it -- you begin your journal.

GANDHI

I have little to say. India is an

"alien" country to me.

GOKHALE

Well, change that. Go and find India.

Not what you see here, but the real

India. You'll see what needs to be

said. What we need to hear.

GOKHALE

When I saw you in that tunic I knew...

I knew I could die in peace.

(A dying man's command)

Make India proud of herself.

CUT TO:

TROOP LEADER

Clear the way! Get out of the way!

GANDHI

(at first distant, as

from the hill)

I ask you to pray for those who died.

(Closer)

For the English soldiers...

(a murmur)

who were doing what they thought was

right.

(Closer)

And for the brave terrorists whose

patriotism led them to do what was

wrong.

GANDHI

It is not my law, it is the law of

creation. We reap what we sow. Out

there in the fields -- and in our

hearts. Violence sows hatred, and

the will to revenge. In them. And in

us.

PATEL

I agree with Jinnah. Now that the

Americans are in, the war will end

soon. The Germans are worn out as it

is...

(he rolls over, facing

Nehru)

and our first act should be to convene

a Congress Party convention and demand

independence.

JINNAH

And we must speak with one voice --

united.

PATEL

(it reminds him)

Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What

the devil has happened to him anyway?

NEHRU

He's "discovering" India.

JINNAH

(cynically)

Which is a lot better than causing

trouble where it matters. Invite him --

let him say his piece about South

Africa -- and then let him slip into

oblivion.

CUT TO:

BA

(quietly, private)

Please! You're being foolish!

GANDHI

There's no room! And the air is

lovely.

CHARLIE

No violence, please.

GANDHI

Let me hang on with two hands or I

will fall.

INDIAN

(over the sound of

the engine)

Englishman Sahib!

INDIAN

Come! Come! There is room!

FIRST INDIAN

(to Charlie)

Place the foot on the window.

GANDHI

(amused, but

disconcerted)

What are you doing?

CHARLIE

(grimly)

Going nearer to God!

BA

Charlie! Be careful!!

CHARLIE

(desperately)

Mohan -- !!

GANDHI

Let go! You'll kill him!

GANDHI

Let go! Let go!

FIRST INDIAN

You see -- most comfortable.

BA

Please, God, no!

SECOND INDIAN

(grinning)

Are you Christian, Sahib?

CHARLIE

(nods)

Yes, yes, I'm a Christian.

SECOND INDIAN

(proudly)

I know a Christian.

(Charlie acknowledges

it politely.)

She drinks blood.

SECOND INDIAN

(explaining -- obvious)

The blood of Christ -- every Sunday!

GANDHI'S VOICE

(alarmed)

Charlie!!

FIRST INDIAN

It's all right, Sahib! Very safe --

bend -- bend!

INDIAN'S VOICE

Pray to God, Sahib! Now is when it

is best to be Hindu!

AND WE DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

JINNAH

(gradually fading in)

We were asked for toleration. We

were asked for patience. Some gave

it and some did not. Well, their war

is over! And those of us who supported

it, and those of us who refused must

forget our differences!

JINNAH

And there can be no excuses from the

British now! India wants Home Rule!

India demands Home Rule!!

PATEL

And let no one question that Mr.

Jinnah speaks not just for the Muslims --

but for all India!

PATEL

And now I'm going to introduce to

you a man whose writings we are all

becoming familiar with... a man who

stood high in the esteem of our

beloved Professor Gokhale... a man

whose accomplishment in South Africa

will always be remembered. Mr.

Mohandas Gandhi.

PATEL

(politely)

Your journal has made a great impact.

GANDHI

I am flattered by Mr. Patel

(His grin.)

I would be even more flattered if

what he said were true.

PATEL

(loudly; he is away

from the mike)

But it's true! I -- I read it...

often.

GANDHI

Since I returned from South Africa,

I have traveled over much of India.

And I know I could travel many more

years and still only see a small

part of it.

GANDHI

...and yet already I know what we

say here means nothing to the masses

of our country.

GANDHI

Here we make speeches for each other --

and those English liberal magazines

that may grant us a few lines.

GANDHI

But the people of India are untouched.

Their politics are confined to bread

and salt.

GANDHI

Illiterate they may be, but they are

not blind. They see no reason to

give their loyalty to rich and

powerful men who simply want to take

over the role of the British in the

name of freedom.

GANDHI

This Congress tells the world it

represents India. My brothers, India

is seven hundred thousand "villages"

not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi

and Bombay. Until we stand in the

fields with the millions who toil

each day under the hot sun, we will

not represent India -- nor will we

ever be able to challenge the British

as one nation.

NEHRU

Have you read his magazine?

PATEL

No -- but I think I'm going to.

FIRST FRIEND

This can't be the way!

SECOND FRIEND

(a mocking quote)

Yes, I'm sure this is the direction

India is taking.

SECOND FRIEND

To think I almost got excited by Mr.

Jinnah when all this was awaiting

me.

NEHRU

We're looking for Mr. Gandhi!

CHARLIE

Ah, you'll find him under the tree

by the river.

(He points off, then

glances at the car.)

You'd better leave the car -- the

ground is rather soft.

NEHRU

Thank you . . .

FIRST FRIEND

(drolly, as he climbs

out)

Come on! I'm anxious to meet this

new "force"!

GANDHI

I try to live like an Indian, as you

see... it is stupid of course, because

in our country it is the British who

decide how an Indian lives -- what

he may buy, what he may sell. And

from their luxury in the midst of

our terrible poverty they instruct

us on what is justice and what is

sedition.

(He looks at them, a

teasing but mordant

grin.)

So it is only natural that our best

young minds assume an air of Eastern

dignity, while greedily assimilating

every Western weakness as quickly as

they can acquire it.

NEHRU

(defensively)

If we have Home Rule that will change.

GANDHI

Would you, please?

GANDHI

And why should the English grant us

Home Rule? Here, we must take the

peelings to the goats.

GANDHI

We only make wild speeches, or perform

even wilder acts of terrorism. We've

bred an army of anarchists but not

one single group that can really

fight the British anywhere.

NEHRU

(surprised)

I thought you were against fighting.

GANDHI

Just spread it around -- they like

the new peelings mixed with the

rotting ones.

GANDHI

Where there is injustice, I've always

believed in fighting.

(He looks at Nehru.)

The question is do you fight to change

things, or do you fight to punish.

(His smile.)

For myself, I have found that we are

all such sinners we should leave

punishment to God. And if we really

want to change things there are better

ways of doing it than by derailing

trains or slashing someone with a

sword.

BA

The fire is ready.

GANDHI

You see, even here we live under

tyranny.

NEHRU

(reflectively)

I told you...

FIRST FRIEND

Hm... but look at him. Some "fighter"!

I can see the British shaking now.

BA

But it's the ink that is the most

diffic --

SHUKLA

I am looking for Mr. Gandhi...

SHUKLA

...I've wanted to speak to you for a

long time.

SHUKLA

...our crops... we can't sell them...

We have no money... but the landlords

take the same rent.

ENGLISH CAPTAIN

Clear the way there! Get out of the

way!

SERGEANT PUTNAM

Sir! Up here!

ENGLISH CAPTAIN

Give me a leg up, will you!

ENGLISH CAPTAIN

What the hell is it, Sergeant?

ENGLISH CAPTAIN

Jesus...!

ENGLISH CAPTAIN

(awed, a little

frightened)

What the hell is going on?

SERGEANT PUTNAM

I don't know, sir. The agent says

they got a telegram and it just said,

he is coming... and gave the time of

the train.

ENGLISH CAPTAIN

Who the hell is he?

SERGEANT PUTNAM

I don't know, sir.

ENGLISH CAPTAIN

Who the devil are you?

GANDHI

My name is Gandhi. Mohandas K. Gandhi.

ENGLISH CAPTAIN

Well, whoever you are, we don't want

you here. I suggest you get back on

that train before it leaves the

station.

GANDHI

(calmly, a glance at

the crowd)

They seem to want me.

ENGLISH CAPTAIN

Now look here. I'll put you under

arrest if you'd prefer?

GANDHI

On what charge?

ENGLISH CAPTAIN

I don't want any trouble.

GANDHI

I am an Indian traveling in my own

country. I see no reason for trouble.

ENGLISH CAPTAIN

Well, there'd better not be.

MEHA

For years the landlords have ordered

us to grow indigo, for dyeing the

cloth. Always they took part of the

crop as rent.

MEHA

But now the English factories make

cloth for everyone. No one wants our

indigo. And the landlords won't take

their share. They say we must pay

our rent in cash.

MEHA

What we could, we sold... The police

have taken the rest. There is no

food, we --

GANDHI

I understand.

(He examines his hands

a moment.)

The landlords are British?

GANDHI

What we can do... we will try to do.

GANDHI

Is all Champaran like this, Shukla?

SHUKLA

Yes, Bapu...

(He looks across the

field.)

The whole province... hundreds --

thousands.

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Mohan -- !

POLICEMAN

(he knows)

Are you Mr. M. K. Gandhi?

GANDHI

Yes.

POLICEMAN

I'm sorry but you are under arrest.

GANDHI

I am not sorry at all.

BATSMAN

(to the wicket keeper)

Who did you say would be buying the

drinks?

BATSMAN

Oh, no --

MAJOR

...I've got no idea. All I know is

there's a riot or something at

Motihari in Champaran, and the whole

company is ordered out.

A VOICE

It's two days' march!

MAJOR

That's why the match is off. It's

mostly Muslim territory and the old

man's taking no chances.

BATSMAN

(disgusted)

God, and it's the best innings I've

had since Oxford.

WICKET KEEPER

(dryly)

India's full of grief, old man.

CHARLIE

(firmly)

I wish to see the prisoner, please.

CAPTAIN

(reluctantly)

All right, Sergeant.

GANDHI

Charlie--

CHARLIE

(a somber grin)

...Shades of South Africa.

GANDHI

Not quite. They're only "holding me"

until the Magistrate's hearing. Then

it will be prison.

CHARLIE

(sympathetically)

Did they take your clothes?

GANDHI

These are my clothes now.

CHARLIE

(affectionately)

You always had a puritanical streak,

Mohan.

GANDHI

(in a tone of

defensiveness)

If I want to be one with them, I

have to live like them.

CHARLIE

I think you do.

(A smile.)

But I thank God we all don't.

GANDHI

I'm sure your legs are quite as

handsome as mine.

CHARLIE

Ah, but my puritanism runs the another

way. I'm far too modest for such a

display.

CHARLIE

Couldn't I be let in with the

prisoner? I am a clergyman.

CHARLIE

(a bit puzzled)

They're calling you "Bapu." I thought

it meant father.

GANDHI

(wistfully)

It does. We must be getting old,

Charlie.

CHARLIE

What do you want me to do?

GANDHI

I think, Charlie, that you can help

us most by taking that assignment

you've been offered in Fiji.

GANDHI

I have to be sure -- they have to be

sure -- that what we do can be done

by Indians... alone.

GANDHI

But you know the strategy. The world

is full of people who will despise

what's happening here. It is their

strength we need. Before you go, you

could start us in the right direction.

CHARLIE

I must leave from Calcutta, and soon.

You'll have to say goodbye to Ba for

me.

GANDHI

When I get the chance.

CHARLIE

Well, I --

GANDHI

There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie.

Wherever you are, you will always be

in my heart...

MAGISTRATE

(whispered conference)

I am going to clear the courtroom.

CLERK

(politely)

I'm not sure we'd be able to. And it

is a first hearing, it's supposed to

be public. And he's a lawyer.

MAGISTRATE

(worried, angry)

I don't know where they found the

nerve for all this.

CLERK

I'm sure I don't either, but the

troops won't be here until tomorrow.

MAGISTRATE

How the press get here before the

military?

CLERK

That English clergyman sent a number

of telegrams yesterday afternoon. I

understand one of them even went to

the Viceroy.

MAGISTRATE

You have been ordered out of the

province on the grounds of disturbing

the peace.

GANDHI

(defiantly)

With respect, I refuse to go.

MAGISTRATE

(sternly)

Do you want to go to jail?

GANDHI

(not giving him an

inch)

As you wish.

MAGISTRATE

(as much sternness as

he can muster)

All right. I will release you on

bail of one hundred rupees until I

reach a sentence.

GANDHI

I refuse to pay one hundred rupees.

MAGISTRATE

Then I -- I will grant release without

bail -- until I reach a decision.

A VOICE

Gandhiji! -- Gandhiji! Mr. Gandhi!

FIRST YOUNG MAN

(his accent is as

refined as his clothes)

Gandhiji -- we are from Bihar. We

received a cable this morning from

an old friend who was at Cambridge

with us.

(A smile.)

His name is Nehru and I believe you

know him.

GANDHI

Indeed.

FIRST YOUNG MAN

He tells us you need help. And we

have come to give it.

GANDHI

I want to document, coldly,

rationally, what is being done here.

It may take months -- many, many

months.

FIRST YOUNG MAN

(they're eager,

impressed)

We have no pressing engagements.

GANDHI

You will have to live with the

peasants.

(They nod.)

I have nothing to pay you.

(They only smile.)

Hmm.

SIR GEORGE

I don't know what this country is

coming to!

SIR EDWARD

But good God, man, you yourself raised

the rent simply to finance a hunting

expedition!

SIR EDWARD

And some of these others --

(he gestures to the

folders again)

beatings, illegal seizures, demanding

services without pay, even refusing

them water! In India!...

SIR GEORGE

Nobody knows what it is to try to

get these people to work!

SIR EDWARD

Well, you've make this half-naked

whatever-he-is into an international

hero.

SIR EDWARD

"One lone man marching dusty roads

armed only with honesty and a bamboo

shaft doing battle with the British

Empire."

(He lowers the paper

dismally; then the

ultimate bitterness)

At home children are writing "essays"

about him.

SIR EDWARD

I couldn't take another two years of

him to save my life.

SIR GEORGE

What do they want?

PERSONAL SECRETARY

(reading precisely

from a document)

A rebate on rents paid.

(Sir George huffs.)

They are to be free to grow crops of

their own choice. A commission --

part Indian -- to hear grievances.

SIR GEORGE

(wearily)

That would satisfy him?...

SIR EDWARD

(a nod; then pointedly)

And His Majesty's Government. It

only needs your signature for the

landlords.

SIR GEORGE

It will be worth it to see the back

of him.

(A flourish at the

end of his signature,

then he stands.)

We're too damn liberal.

SIR EDWARD

Perhaps. But at least all this has

made the Government see some sense

about what men like Mr. Gandhi should

be allowed, and what they should be

denied.

SIR EDWARD

(firmly)

Things are going to change.

JINNAH

(in annoyance)

Where is Mr. Gandhi?

CHAUFFEUR

(distastefully)

He said he preferred to walk, sir. I

followed him most of the way. He's

just turned the corner.

JINNAH

The Prophet give me patience.

CHAUFFEUR

He came Third Class.

JINNAH

(with effort)

My house is honored.

GANDHI

(he makes the pranam)

The honor is ours. May I introduce

Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend

(anticipating Jinnah's

objection)

and his interest is in flowers. I

presumed to tell him he could wander

your gardens while we talked.

JINNAH

(the suave, but

slightly ironic host)

I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll

have much to discuss.

JINNAH

Gentlemen -- the hero of Champaran.

GANDHI

Only the stubborn man of Champaran.

JINNAH

Mr. Patel you know.

(Patel bows.)

Mr. Maulana Azad -- a fellow Muslim...

recently released from prison.

JINNAH

Mr. Kripalani.

(A bow -- we have

seen him at the

Congress Conference.)

And of course you know Mr. Nehru.

GANDHI

(a play on Jinnah's

introduction)

I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.

PATEL

(to business: Gandhi

has been admitted to

the power circle, he

is not the power)

Well, I've called you here because

I've had a chance to see the new

legislation. It's exactly what was

rumored. Arrest without warrant.

Automatic imprisonment for possession

of materials considered seditious...

PATEL

Your writings are specifically listed.

KRIPALANI

So much for helping them in the Great

War...

JINNAH

(fire)

There is only one answer to that.

Direct action -- on a scale they can

never handle!

NEHRU

I don't think so.

NEHRU

Terrorism would only justify their

repression. And what kinds of leaders

would it throw up? Are they likely

to be the men we would want at the

head of our country?

NEHRU

I've been catching up on my reading.

JINNAH

(coldly)

I too have read Mr. Gandhi's writings,

but I'd rather be ruled by an Indian

terrorist than an English one. And I

don't want to submit to that kind of

law.

PATEL

(to Nehru --

diplomatically --

but with a trace of

condescension)

I must say, Panditji, it seems to me

it's gone beyond remedies like passive

resistance.

GANDHI

(in the silence)

If I may -- I, for one, have never

advocated passive anything.

GANDHI

I am with Mr. Jinnah. We must never

submit to such laws -- ever. And I

think our resistance must be active

and provocative.

GANDHI

I want to embarrass all those who

wish to treat us as slaves. All of

them.

GANDHI

Forgive my stupid illustration. But

I want to change their minds -- not

kill them for weaknesses we all

possess.

AZAD

And what "resistance" would you offer?

GANDHI

The law is due to take effect from

April sixth. I want to call on the

nation to make that a day of prayer

and fasting.

JINNAH

You mean a general strike?

GANDHI

(his grin)

I mean a day of prayer and fasting.

But of course no work could be done --

no buses, no trains, no factories,

no administration. The country would

stop.

PATEL

My God, it would terrify them...

AZAD

(a wry smile)

Three hundred fifty million people

at prayer. Even the English newspapers

would have to report that. And explain

why.

KRIPALANI

But could we get people to do it?

NEHRU

(he is half sold

already)

Champaran stirred the whole country.

(To Gandhi)

They are calling you Mahatma -- the

Great Soul.

GANDHI

Fortunately such news comes very

slowly where I live.

NEHRU

(continuing, to the

others)

I think if we all worked to publicize

it... all of the Congress... every

avenue we know.

JINNAH

Perhaps I should have stayed in the

garden and talked about the flowers.

ADC

Sir -- it's Mr. Kinnoch.

CHELMSFORD

Yes?

KINNOCH

(hesitant, stunned)

Nothing... nothing is working, sir --

buses... trains... the markets...

(Personal, incredulous)

There's not even any civilian staff

here, sir... Everything has stopped.

CHELMSFORD

(curt, firm)

Is it simply Delhi and Bombay?

KINNOCH

No, sir -- Karachi, Calcutta, Madras,

Bangalore. It's, it's total.

KINNOCH

(the ultimate)

The Army had to take over the

telegraph or we'd be cut off from

the world.

CHELMSFORD

I can't believe it...

KINNOCH

He's going to sell his own paper

tomorrow in Bombay. They've called

for a parade -- on Victoria Road.

CHELMSFORD

(clenches his jaw and

turns to the General)

Arrest him!

NEHRU

Bapu...

GANDHI

You too...

NEHRU

(a real smile, but

the same affection)

It seems less formal than "Mahatma."

NEHRU

Since your arrest the riots have

hardly stopped. Not big --; but they

keep breaking out. I run to stop

them... and Patel and Kripalani --

they are never at rest. But some

English civilians have been killed,

and the Army is attacking crowds

with clubs -- and sometimes worse.

GANDHI

Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not

ready yet. In South Africa the numbers

were small...

NEHRU

The Government's afraid, and they

don't know what to do. But they're

more afraid of terrorists than of

you. The Viceroy has agreed to your

release if you will speak for non-

violence.

GANDHI

(a sad smile)

I've never spoken for anything else.

SPEAKER

...England is so powerful -- its

army and its navy, all its modern

weapons -- but when a great power

like that strikes defenseless people

it shows it brutality, its own

weakness! Especially when those people

do not strike back.

(He holds aloft the

clenched journal.)

That is why the Mahatma begs us to

take the course of non-violence!

SPEAKER

...If we riot, if we fight back, we

become the vandals and they become

the law! If we bear their blows,

they are the vandals -- God and His

law are on our...

(He glances up.)

side.

SPEAKER

(soldiering on)

...We must have the courage to take

their anger...

DYER

Port arms, Sergeant Major.

DYER

Load.

SPEAKER

(almost to himself as

he too is riveted)

...Our pain will be our victory.

ADC

Do we issue a warning, sir?

DYER

(stiffly)

They've had their warning -- no

meetings.

DYER

Sergeant Major --

SERGEANT MAJOR

Take aim!

DYER

Fire!

SERGEANT MAJOR

Reload!

DYER

Take your time. Take your time.

DYER

Corporal!

CORPORAL

Sir!

DYER

Over there.

CORPORAL

Sir.

CUT TO:

ADVOCATE

General Dyer, is it correct that you

ordered your troops to fire at the

thickest part of the crowd?

DYER

(righteously)

That is so.

ADVOCATE

One thousand five hundred and sixteen

casualties with one thousand six

hundred and fifty bullets.

DYER

My intention was to inflict a lesson

that would have an impact throughout

all India.

INDIAN BARRISTER

General, had you been able to take

in the armored car, would you have

opened fire with the machine gun?

DYER

I think, probably -- yes.

HUNTER

General, did you realize there were

children -- and women -- in the crowd?

DYER

(a beat)

I did.

ADVOCATE

But that was irrelevant to the point

you were making?

DYER

That is correct.

ADVOCATE

Could I ask you what provision you

made for the wounded?

DYER

(a moment, then firmly)

I was ready to help any who applied.

ADVOCATE

General... how does a child shot

with a 3-0-3 Enfield "apply" for

help?

FADE OUT:

CHELMSFORD

You must understand, gentlemen, that

His Majesty's Government -- and the

British people -- repudiate both the

massacre and the philosophy that

prompted it.

CHELMSFORD

What I would like to do is to come

to some compromise over the new civil

legis --

GANDHI

If you will excuse me, Your

Excellency, it is our view that

matters have gone beyond

"legislation."

GANDHI

We think it is time you recognized

that you are masters in someone else's

home.

(It chills, stiffens;

Gandhi proceeds only

an iota softer)

Despite the best intentions of the

best of you, you must, in the nature

of things, humiliate us to control

us. General Dyer is but an extreme

example of the principle. It is time

you left.

KINNOCH

With respect, Mr. Gandhi, without

British administration, this country

would be reduced to chaos.

GANDHI

(patient, ironic)

Mr. Kinnoch, I beg you to accept

that there is no people on earth who

would not prefer their own bad

government to the "good" government

of an alien power.

BRIGADIER

(indignantly, choked)

My dear sir -- India is British!

We're hardly an alien power!

CHELMSFORD

Even if His Majesty could waive all

other considerations, he has a duty

to the millions of his Muslim subjects

who are a minority in this realm.

And experience has taught that his

troops and his administration are

essential in order to keep the peace.

GANDHI

All nations contain religious

minorities. Like other countries,

ours will have its problems.

(Flat, irrevocable)

But they will be ours -- not yours.

GENERAL

And how do you propose to make them

yours? You don't think we're just

going to walk out of India.

GANDHI

Yes... in the end you will walk out.

Because one hundred thousand

Englishmen simply cannot control

three hundred fifty million Indians

if the Indians refuse to co-operate.

And that is what we intend to achieve --

peaceful, non-violent, non-co-

operation.

GANDHI

Until you yourself see the wisdom of

leaving... your Excellency.

GENERAL

(mocking his exchange

with Gandhi)

"You don't just expect us to walk

out?" "Yes."

BRIGADIER

Extraordinary little man! "Nonviolent,

non-co-operation" -- for a moment I

almost thought they were actually

going to do something.

CHELMSFORD

(thoughtfully)

Yes -- but it would be wise to be

very cautious for a time. The Anti-

Terrorist Act will remain on the

statutes, but on no account is Gandhi

to be arrested. Whatever mischief he

causes, I have no intention of making

a martyr of him.

BA

(simple, direct)

...but now something worse is

happening. When Gandhiji and I were

growing up, women wove their own

cloth. But now there are millions

who have no work because those who

can buy all they need from England.

I say with Gandhiji, there is no

beauty in the finest cloth if it

makes hunger and unhappiness.

GANDHI

My message tonight is the message I

have given to your brothers

everywhere. To gain independence we

must prove worthy of it.

GANDHI

There must be Hindu-Muslim unity --

always.

(A second finger.)

Secondly, no Indian must be treated

as the English treat us so we must

remove untouchability from our lives,

and from our hearts.

GANDHI

Third -- we must defy the British.

GANDHI

Not with violence that will inflame

their will, but with firmness that

will open their eyes.

GANDHI

English factories make the cloth --

that makes our poverty.

(A reaction.)

All those who wish to make the English

see, bring me the cloth from

Manchester and Leeds that you wear

tonight, and we will light a fire

that will be seen in Delhi -- and

London!

GANDHI

And if, like me, you are left with

only one piece of homespun -- wear

it with dignity!

PATEL

Excuse me -- just let me get out of

your way, please.

(Someone reaches for

his bedroll and bag.)

No, thank you, I'll manage.

PATEL

(joyous -- it's been

a long time)

Ah, Herman!

(Of the bags)

No, no -- don't destroy my good

intentions. I'm feeling guilty about

traveling Second Class.

KALLENBACH

I do it as a friend -- and admirer --

not a servant.

PATEL

Ah, in that case!

PATEL

Maulana is made of sterner stuff.

Our trains met in Bombay, but he's

back there in that lot somewhere.

PATEL'S VOICE-OVER

There he is -- out Gandhi-ing Gandhi.

PATEL

(shaking his head at

it all)

When I think what our "beloved

Mahatma" asks, I don't know how he

ever got such a hold over us. Is he

back?

KALLENBACH

Yes. Now that things are moving he's

going to write and only take part

when it's necessary.

AZAD

(to Patel)

It was a Hindu child and it tried to

wet on me.

PATEL

Of course. A Muslim beef eater --

I'm only surprised he missed.

AZAD

He was a she.

PATEL

Ah, that explains it.

(He grins.)

Well, do I carry your luggage as

penance or --

KALLENBACH

There's another passenger -- a Miss

Slade.

(He turns

automatically, as

Patel and Azad do,

toward the First

Class section.)

She's the daughter of an English

admiral.

(Patel and Azad look

back at him in quick

surprise. Kallenbach

smiles.)

She's been corresponding with him

for a year.

PATEL

And what does the daughter of an

English admiral propose to do in an

ashram -- sink us?

AZAD

(quietly -- his manner)

From the looks of the luggage, yes.

KALLENBACH

She wants to make her home with us --

and Gandhiji has agreed.

MIRABEHN

You'd be Mr. Kallenbach.

KALLENBACH

...And you would be Miss Slade.

MIRABEHN

(proudly)

I prefer the name Gandhiji has given

me -- Mirabehn.

KALLENBACH

(of the car)

It was a gift and it only worked a

few weeks, but when Gandhi came home

he struck on this idea. He calls it

his ox-Ford. Comfortable -- and yet

more our pace.

MIRABEHN

Might Mr. Nehru be there too?

PATEL

(glibly)

The irresponsible young Nehru is in

prison -- again. Though there is a

rumor that under pressure from your

country, they will let him out --

again.

MIRABEHN

You can't know how closely we follow

your struggle --

(to Patel personally)

how many in England admired what you

did in Bardoli. It must have taken

enormous courage.

PATEL

Well, in this country one must decide

if one is more afraid of the

government or Gandhi.

(Of Azad, Kallenbach

and himself)

For us, it's Gandhi.

MIRABEHN

(a note of wonder)

And you're German...

KALLENBACH

Yes.

MIRABEHN

And do you feel Indian?

KALLENBACH

No.

MIRABEHN

But you've been with him so long --

why?

KALLENBACH

...I'd come to believe I would never

meet a truly honest man. And then I

met one.

BA

Stop -- stop...

BA

God gave you ten thumbs.

GANDHI

(morosely)

Eleven.

GANDHI

Sardar...

GANDHI

What you've done is a miracle. You

have made all India proud.

PATEL

It must have been the only Non-violent

campaign ever led by a man who wanted

to kill everybody every day.

GANDHI

(laughs)

Not true!

(He means himself.)

The secret is mastering the urge.

AZAD

He came Second Class.

GANDHI

Well, we can't expect miracles all

the time.

(Then to Azad, more

soberly)

Your news I understand is not so

good.

AZAD

No.

GANDHI

Come, come -- you will be my

daughter...

AZAD

...but then some rioting broke out

between Hindus and Muslims -- violent,

terrible...

AZAD

Whether it was provoked...

(he shrugs, a hint of

suspicion)

But it gave them an excuse to impose

martial law throughout Bengal.

(He looks at Gandhi,

shaking his head

grimly.)

Some of the things the military have

done...

GANDHI

Is the campaign weakening?

AZAD

The marches and protests are bigger

if anything but with the censorship

here

(a nod toward Mirabehn)

they know more in England than we

do, and it saps the courage to think

you may be suffering alone.

GANDHI

They are not alone. And martial law

only shows how desperate the British

are.

GANDHI

Is that homespun? Or cotton from

Leeds?

MIRABEHN

I -- I sent for it, from here. I

dyed it myself.

GANDHI

What do the workers in England make

of what we're doing? It must have

produced hardship.

MIRABEHN

It has. But you'd be surprised. They

understand -- they really do. It's

not the workers you have to worry

about.

GANDHI

Good.

(A glance toward Ba.)

Ba will have to teach you to spin

too.

MIRABEHN

I would rather march.

GANDHI

First spin. Let the others march for

a time.

BA

First lesson: To march, wear shoes,

to spin, do not.

BA

I'll teach you all our foolishness,

and you must teach me yours.

MARCHERS

Home Rule! Long live Gandhi! Buy

Indian! Long live Gandhi!

POLICEMAN

I'll stuff your damn mouth with it!

SECOND MARCHER

Leave him alone -- he wasn't harming

you!

TAIL-ENDERS

Help! Help us! as they try to scramble

away from the attack. Out of shot we

can still hear the disappearing chant:

"Home Rule! Long live Gandhi!"

TAIL-ENDER

(screaming)

Help! Help us!

POLICEMAN

Hey --

PATEL'S VOICE

That's one bit of news they haven't

censored.

JINNAH'S VOICE

Oh, it's all over the world...

(ironically)

India's "non-violence."

NEHRU

(bleakly)

What can we do?

GANDHI

(sepulchrally)

We must end the campaign.

JINNAH

After what they did at the massacre --

it's only an eye for an eye.

GANDHI

(he hasn't moved; the

same tone)

An eye for an eye only ends up making

the whole world blind.

(Now he looks up at

them.)

We must stop.

PATEL

(a baffled smile)

Gandhiji -- do you know the sacrifices

people have made?

JINNAH

We would never get the same commitment

again -- ever.

GANDHI

If we obtain our freedom by murder

and bloodshed I want no part of it.

NEHRU

(pleading)

It was one incident.

GANDHI

(quietly)

Tell that to the families of the

policemen who died.

NEHRU

Bapu -- the whole nation is marching.

They wouldn't stop, even if we asked

them to.

GANDHI

I will ask. And I will fast as penance

for my part in arousing such emotions --

and I will not stop until they stop.

JINNAH

(disgustedly)

God! You can be sure the British

won't censor that! They'll put it on

every street corner.

NEHRU

But -- but Gandhiji people are

aroused... they won't stop.

GANDHI

If I die, perhaps they will...

BA

(softly)

I must get ready for evening prayers.

Mirabehn is here.

MIRABEHN

I've brought your drinking water.

May I turn you?

MIRABEHN

There is a little lemon juice in it.

That is all.

MIRABEHN

Herman has gone to meet Pandit Nehru --

there was a telegram. Almost

everywhere it has stopped.

GANDHI

When it is everywhere, then my prayers

will be answered.

GANDHI

Do you find me stubborn?

MIRABEHN

(her own honesty)

I don't know... I know you are right.

I don't know that this is right.

GANDHI

(hoarse, strained)

When I despair, I remember that all

through history the way of truth and

love has always won.

GANDHI

There have been tyrants and murderers,

and for a time they can seem

invincible. But in the end they always

fall. Think of it -- always... When

you are in doubt that that is God's

way, the way the world is meant to

be... think of that.

GANDHI

(the paternal smile)

And then -- try to do it His way.

(A tear runs down

Mirabehn's face. She

touches his shoulder.

Gandhi just leans

his head back in

exhaustion.)

And now -- could I have another feast

of lemon juice?

MIRABEHN

Panditji -- come in.

NEHRU

Jinnah, Patel, all of Congress has

called for the end of non-co-

operation. There's not been one

demonstration. All over India people

are praying that you will end the

fast. They're walking in the streets,

offering garlands to the police --

and to British soldiers.

GANDHI

(croaked)

Perhaps -- perhaps I have overdone

it.

LITTLE BOY

Good morning, Bapu!

GANDHI

Good morning.

(Of the goat)

Don't let her go. If she bumps me I

am done for.

LITTLE BOY

Don't worry. I milk her every day,

she's not --

POLICE SUPERINTENDENT

(a beat)

Sedition.

NEHRU

(it is too absurd)

You can't be serious! This man has

just stopped a revolution!

POLICE SUPERINTENDENT

(uncomfortably; he

knows)

That's as may be. I only know what I

am charged to perform.

NEHRU

I don't believe it -- even the British

can't be that stupid!

GANDHI

Panditji -- please, help me.

GANDHI

You must help Herman -- and Ba.

(He releases her, and

says more loudly to

the others)

I have been on many trips -- it is

just another trip.

GANDHI

I am at your command.

GANDHI

(to Nehru)

If there is one protest -- one riot --

a disgrace of any kind, I will fast

again.

GANDHI

(and now he smiles --

Gandhi to Nehru,

special)

I know India is not ready for my

kind of independence. If I am sent

to jail, perhaps that is the best

protest our country can make at this

time. And if it helps India, I have

never refused to take His Majesty's

hospitality.

CLERK

Call the prisoner to the bar.

ADVOCATE GENERAL

..."Non-co-operation has one aim:

the overthrow of the Government.

Sedition must become our creed. We

must give no quarter, nor can we

expect any."

(He looks up at Gandhi.)

Signed M. K. Gandhi, in your journal

Young India, dated twenty-second

March of this year. Do you deny

writing it?

GANDHI

Not at all.

(To the judge)

And I will save the Court's time,

M'Lord, by stating under oath that

to this day I believe non-co-operation

with evil is a duty. And that British

rule of India is evil.

ADVOCATE GENERAL

The Prosecution rests, M'Lord.

JUDGE BROOMFIELD

I take it you will conduct your own

defense, Mr. Gandhi.

GANDHI

I have no defense, My Lord. I am

guilty as charged.

(Then testingly)

And if you truly believe in the system

of law you administer in my country,

you must inflict on me the severest

penalty possible.

JUDGE BROOMFIELD

It is impossible for me to ignore

that you are in a different category

from any person I have ever tried,

or am likely to try.

JUDGE BROOMFIELD

(a long beat)

It is nevertheless my duty to sentence

you -- to six years' imprisonment.

JUDGE BROOMFIELD

(a personal statement,

not a real hope)

If however His Majesty's Government

could -- at some later date -- see

fit to reduce that term, no one would

be better pleased than I.

COLLINS' VOICE-OVER

(English accent)

Yes, I'm sure that's exactly what

they hoped. Put him in prison a few

years and with luck he'd be forgotten.

And maybe they'd even subdue him...

COLLINS

Well, he certainly wasn't forgotten!

And as soon as he got out he was

back tramping the country, preaching

non-violence and demanding a free

India. Everybody knows another

showdown's coming -- but when, and

over what --

WALKER

Well, I read you account of that

crowd in Calcutta and that he was

twisting the Lion's tail again...

WALKER

(falteringly)

...and I knew something had to give.

And I was determined to be here when

it did.

COLLINS

How does a reporter in Central America

learn that Gandhi was born in

Porbandar anyway?

WALKER

Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a

long time.

COLLINS

He certainly makes good copy.

(A laugh.)

The other day Winston Churchill called

him "that half-naked Indian fakir."

WALKER

I met him once.

COLLINS

You mean Gandhi?

WALKER

(nods)

Back in South Africa...

(reflectively)

long time ago.

COLLINS

What was he like?

WALKER

Lots of hair... and a little like a

college freshman -- trying to figure

everything out.

COLLINS

Well, he must've found some of the

answers...

BA

(a step forward)

"In every worthy wish of yours, I

shall be your helpmate."

GANDHI

(a step)

"Take a fourth step, that we may be

ever full of joy."

BA

(a step)

"I will ever live devoted to you,

speaking words of love and praying

for your happiness."

GANDHI

"Take a fifth step, that we may serve

the people."

BA

"I will follow close behind you and

help to serve the people."

GANDHI

"Take a sixth step, that we may follow

our vows in life."

BA

"I will follow you in all our vows

and duties."

GANDHI

(a last step)

"Take the seventh step, that we may

ever live as friends."

BA

"You are my best friend... my highest

guru, and my sovereign lord."

GANDHI

Then I put a sweetened wheat cake in

her mouth.

BA

And I put a sweetened wheat cake in

his mouth.

GANDHI

And with that we were pronounced man

and wife.

(Solemnly)

We were both thirteen...

WALKER

It's beautiful.

GANDHI

Even as a boy I thought so.

WALKER

Trying to keep track of you is making

me change all my sleeping habits.

GANDHI

And you've come all this way because

you think something is going to

happen?

WALKER

Hm.

(Then weightedly)

Is it?

GANDHI

Perhaps. I've come here to think

about it.

GANDHI

(musing)

Do you remember much of South Africa?

WALKER

A great deal.

GANDHI

I've traveled so far -- and thought

so much.

(He smiles in self-

mockery, and turns

toward the city.)

As you can see, my city was a sea

city -- always filled with Hindus

and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and

Persians.

(He looks at Walker.)

The temple where you were yesterday

is of my family's sect, the Pranami.

It was Hindu of course but the priests

used to read from the Muslim Koran

and the Hindu Gita, moving from one

to the other as though it mattered

not at all which book was read as

long as God was worshipped.

GANDHI

When I was a boy I used to sing a

song in that temple: "A true disciple

knows another's woes as his own. He

bows to all and despises none...

Earthly possessions hold him not."

Like all boys I said the words, not

thinking of what they meant or how

they might be influencing me.

(He looks at Walker...

then out to the sea

again, shaking his

head.)

I've traveled so far... and all I've

done is come back home.

WALKER

You know what you're going to do.

GANDHI

It would have been very uncivil of

me to let you make such a long trip

for nothing.

WALKER

Where are you going?

GANDHI

I'm going back to the ashram

(then firmly)

and then I'm going to prove to the

new Viceroy that the King's writ no

longer runs in India!

IRWIN

Salt?

PRINCIPAL SECRETARY

Yes, sir. He is going to march to

the sea and make salt.

SENIOR POLICE OFFICER

There is a Royal Monopoly on the

manufacture of salt, sir. It's illegal

to make it or sell it without a

Government license.

IRWIN

All right -- he's breaking the law.

What will he be depriving us of, two

rupees of salt tax?

PRINCIPAL SECRETARY

It's not a serious attack on the

revenue, sir. Its primary importance

is symbolic.

IRWIN

Don't patronize me, Charles.

PRINCIPAL SECRETARY

No, sir. I -- in this climate, sir,

nothing lives without water -- or

salt. Our absolute control of it is

a control on the pulse of India.

IRWIN

And that's the basis of this

"Declaration of Independence"?

SENIOR POLICE OFFICER

Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone

is supposed to raise the flag of

"Free India." Then he walks some two

hundred and forty miles to the sea

and makes salt.

GENERAL

I say ignore it. Let them raise their

damn flags, let him make his salt.

It's only symbolic if we choose to

make it so.

PRINCIPAL SECRETARY

(pointedly)

He's going to arrive at the sea on

the anniversary of the massacre at

Amritsar.

IRWIN

General Edgar is right -- ignore it.

Mr. Gandhi will find it's going to

take a great deal more than a pinch

of salt to bring down the British

Empire.

GANDHI

(to Nehru)

...the real test will come if I am

arrested. If there is violence we

lose all our moral advantage. This

time it mustn't happen.

NEHRU

We're not beginners anymore. We've

been trained by a strict sergeant

major.

GANDHI

If I'm taken, Maulana is to lead the

march. If he is arrested, Patel,

then Kripalani, then yourself.

BA

You should be relaxing.

GANDHI

I'm sure I'm fit for at least five

hundred miles.

MIRABEHN

You should ride the pony. It is not

necessary to walk to prove the point.

GANDHI

I have two of them bossing me now.

NEHRU

We must get these to the printer.

(He looks down at

Gandhi.)

I know it will succeed. Even my mother

is prepared to march.

GANDHI

And Jinnah?

NEHRU

(a beat)

He's waiting. He's not prepared to

accept it will mean as much as you

think.

GANDHI

(smiles confidently)

Wait and see... wait and see...

GANDHI

(of the press)

You've done me a great service.

WALKER

(a grin, then a play

on Gandhi's words to

him)

It would have been uncivil of me to

have let you make such a long trip

for nothing.

WALKER

Is it over if they arrest you now?

GANDHI

Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand --

or ten thousand.

(He looks at Walker.)

It is not only generals who know how

to plan campaigns.

WALKER

What if they don't arrest you? What

if they don't react at all?

GANDHI

Do you still have your notebook?

(Walker fumbles for

it; Gandhi goes right

on talking.)

The function of a civil resister is

to provoke response. And we will

continue to provoke until they

respond, or they change the law.

They are not in control -- we are.

That is the strength of civil

resistance.

COLLINS

What'd he say?

WALKER

(wryly)

He said he's in charge...

GANDHI

Are you going to walk all the way?

WALKER

(a weary grin)

My name is Walk-er. And I intend to

report it the way it is.

GANDHI

(to himself)

"My name is Walk-er"...

STUDENT LEADER

We've come to join the march. What

do we do?

PYARELAL

(bluntly)

Be sure you're awake in the morning.

(It comes from a

knowledge of students.

He smiles and nods

off.)

Find a place to sleep.

GANDHI'S VOICE-OVER

Man needs salt as he needs air and

water. This salt comes from the Indian

Ocean.

(The salt crystals

are added to an urn

already partially

full. The camera

pulls back and Gandhi

lifts the urn. All

around him the

pressing crowd:

newsreel cameramen,

reporters -- Walker,

Collins, Naidu,

Pyarelal. Firmly)

Let every Indian claim it as his

right!!

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE-OVER

...and so once more the man of non-

violence has challenged the might of

the British Empire.

SENIOR POLICE OFFICER

They're making it everywhere, sir --

mobs of them -- publicly. Congress

leaders are selling it on the streets

of Delhi.

BRIGADIER

We're being made fools of around the

world!

GENERAL

Isn't there any instruction from

London?

IRWIN

We're required to stop it.

(He stands, his mind

made up.)

And stop it we will.

(He looks at the senior

police officer.)

I don't care if we fill the jails,

stop it. Arrest anyone, any rank --

except Gandhi. We'll cut his strength

from under him. And then we'll deal

with the Mahatma.

BRITISH SUBALTERN

Oh, my God!

SUBALTERN

Right -- jump to it -- clear this

beach!

NEHRU

No violence, Zia!

NEHRU

(repeating quietly,

as though to Zia)

...no violence.

SERGEANT

You're Nehru --

NEHRU

I'm an illegal trader in salt.

SENIOR POLICE OFFICER

...There's been no time to keep

figures, but there must be ninety --

a hundred thousand under arrest.

(Grimly, incredibly)

And it still goes on.

IRWIN

(impatiently)

Who's leading them?

SENIOR POLICE OFFICER

I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost

every Congress Official is in jail...

and their wives and their children --

we've even arrested Nehru's mother.

PRINCIPAL SECRETARY

(shrewdly)

Has there been any violence?

SENIOR POLICE OFFICER

(distracted, offhand)

Oh, in Karachi the police fired on a

crowd and killed a couple of people

and --

(and this hurts)

and in Peshawar the Deputy Police

Commissioner lost his head and...

and opened fire with a machine gun.

(He looks up at them

quickly, defensively.)

But he's facing a disciplinary court!

You can't expect things like that

not to happen when --

IRWIN

(dryly)

I believe the question was intended

to discover if there was any violence

of their side.

SENIOR POLICE OFFICER

Oh, no, sir -- no, I'm afraid not.

PRINCIPAL SECRETARY

(again the

Machiavellian mind)

Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi, it

might --

IRWIN

(to senior police

officer)

He's addressed this letter directly

to you, has he?

SENIOR POLICE OFFICER

Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's

salt belongs to India -- but then he

says flatly that he personally is

going to lead a raid tomorrow on the

Dharasana Salt Works.

IRWIN

(calmly)

Thank him for his letter, and put

him in jail.

SENIOR POLICE OFFICER

Yes, sir. Yes, sir. It will be my

pleasure.

IRWIN

And Fields, keep that salt works

open.

SENIOR POLICE OFFICER

(delighted)

Yes, sir!

AZAD

I would like admission to the Works.

CHIEF POLICE OFFICER

(equally politely)

I am sorry, sir. That cannot be

allowed.

AZAD

Last night they took Gandhiji from

us. They expect us to lose heart or

to fight back. We will not lose heart,

we will not fight back. In his name

we will be beaten. As he has taught

us, we will not raise a hand. "Long

live Mahatma Gandhi!"

POLICE COMMANDING OFFICER

(finally)

Now!

WALKER

(into the phone)

Hello! Ed! Ed! Goddammit, don't cut

me off!

(Then suddenly he's

through.)

Ed! Okay -- yeah -- right.

WALKER

"They walked, with heads up, without

music, or cheering, or any hope of

escape from injury or death."

(His voice is taut,

harshly professional.)

"It went on and on and on. Women

carried the wounded bodies from the

ditch until they dropped from

exhaustion. But still it went on."

WALKER

"Whatever moral ascendance the West

held was lost today. India is free

for she has taken all that steel and

cruelty can give, and she has neither

cringed nor retreated."

(On Walker close. His

sweating, blood and

dirt-stained face

near tears.)

"In the words of his followers, 'Long

live Mahatma Gandhi.' "

GANDHI

I am aware that I must have given

you much cause for irritation, your

Excellency. I hope it will not stand

between us as men.

IRWIN

Mr. Gandhi, I have instructions to

request your attendance at an All-

Government Conference in London to

discuss -- to discuss the possible

Independence of India.

MACDONALD

I think our first duty is to recognize

that there is not one India, but

several: a Hindu India, a Muslim

India, and India of Princely States.

And all these must be respected --

and cared for -- not just one.

GANDHI

(to Walker)

Do I speak into that?

GANDHI

Are they ready? Do I start?

GANDHI

I am glad to speak to America where

so many friends exist that I know

only in my heart.

GANDHI'S VOICE

(continuing over all)

I think your interest and the world's

has fallen on India, not only because

we are struggling for freedom, but

because the way we are doing so is

unique as far as history shows us.

Here in Europe mighty nations are,

it seems, already contemplating

another war, though I think they,

and all the world, are sick to death

of bloodspilling. All of us are

seeking a way out, and I flatter

myself that perhaps the ancient land

of India will offer such a way. If

we are to make progress we must not

repeat history, but make history.

And I myself will die before I betray

our belief that love is a stronger

weapon than hate.

GANDHI

It is only a sprain. Take her to the

river, and we'll make a mud-pack for

her. Go -- I won't be long.

JINNAH

So the truth is, after all your

travels, all your efforts, they've

stopped the campaign and sent you

home empty-handed.

GANDHI

They are only clinging to old dreams

(looks up from his

spinning to Jinnah)

and trying to split us in the old

way. But the will has gone --

Independence will drop like a ripe

apple. The only question is when

(another glance at

Jinnah)

and how.

NEHRU

I say when is now -- and we will

determine how.

JINNAH

Precisely.

GANDHI

They are preparing for war. I will

not support it, but I do not intend

to take advantage of their danger.

PATEL

(blithely, but to the

point)

That's when you take advantage.

GANDHI

No. That is just another way of

striking back. We have come a long

way together with the British. When

they leave we want to see them off

as friends.

(He starts down the

steps and heads for

the river.)

And now, if you'll excuse me, there

is something I must attend to.

NEHRU

(resignedly)

"Mud packs."

BRITISH COLONEL

Mr. Gandhi -- sir.

BRITISH COLONEL

I have instructions to inquire as to

the subject of your speech tonight.

GANDHI

The value of goat's milk in daily

diet.

(Into his eyes)

But you can be sure I will also speak

against war.

BRITISH COLONEL

I'm sorry, sir. That can't be allowed.

ADJUTANT

It's all right, Mrs. Gandhi. I have

orders to return with you and your

companion to the Mahatma's ashram.

BA

If you take my husband, I intend to

speak in his place.

BOURKE-WHITE

Stop! Wait a minute!

LIEUTENANT

It was the Aga Khan's palace, but

they've turned it into a prison.

LIEUTENANT

(shouting over the

motor)

They've got most of the leading

Congress politicians in this one.

But Nehru and some others are over

in Dehra Dun. Your timing's pretty

lucky. They had your Mr. Gandhi cut

off from the press but last month

his personal secretary died and

they've let up on the restrictions.

GANDHI

Yes, I have heard of Life Magazine.

(A smile.)

I have even heard of Margaret Bourke-

White. But I don't know why either

should be interested in an old man

sitting in prison when the world is

blowing itself to pieces.

BOURKE-WHITE

(a beat -- and she

smiles)

You're the only man I know who makes

his own clothes.

GANDHI

Ah, but for me that's not much of an

accomplishment.

GANDHI

No -- prison is rather agreeable to

me, and there is no doubt that after

the war, independence will come. My

only worry is what shape it will

take. Jinnah has --

BOURKE-WHITE

Stop!

BOURKE-WHITE

Now go on -- just as you were.

BOURKE-WHITE

(coaching)

"...what shape it will take." Jinnah

has -- what?

GANDHI

(at first disconcerted,

but then flowing)

Jinnah has -- has cooperated with

the British. It has given him power

and the freedom to speak, and he has

filled the Muslims with fears of

what will happen to them in a country

that is predominantly Hindu.

(He stops, lowering

his head gravely.)

That I find hard to bear -- even in

prison.

BOURKE-WHITE

(archly, but

emphatically of the

spinning)

I do not see it as the solution of

the twentieth century's problems!

GANDHI

I have a friend who keeps telling me

how much it costs him to keep me in

poverty.

GANDHI

(a bit more seriously)

But I know happiness does not come

with things -- even twentieth century

things. It can come from work, and

pride in what you do.

(He looks at her

steadily.)

It will not necessarily be "progress"

for India if she simply imports the

unhappiness of the West.

BOURKE-WHITE

But do you really believe you could

use non-violence against someone

like Hitler?

GANDHI

(a thoughtful pause)

Not without defeats -- and great

pain.

(He looks at her.)

But are there no defeats in this war --

no pain?

(For a moment the

thought hangs, and

then Gandhi takes

their hands back to

the spinning.)

What you cannot do is accept

injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone.

You must make the injustice visible --

be prepared to die like a soldier to

do so.

BOURKE-WHITE

Is my finger supposed to be wrapped

around that?

GANDHI

(laughs)

No. That is what you get for

distracting me.

BOURKE-WHITE

What do you expect when you talk

like that?

GANDHI

(trying to unravel

the mess)

I expect you to show as much patience

as I am now.

GANDHI

Every enemy is a human being -- even

the worst of them. And he believes

he is right and you are a beast.

(And now a little

smile.)

And if you beat him over the head

you will only convince him. But you

suffer, to show him that he is wrong,

your sacrifice creates an atmosphere

of understanding -- if not with him,

then in the hearts of the rest of

the community on whom he depends.

GANDHI

If you are right, you will win --

after much pain.

(He looks at her,

then smiles in his

own ironic way.)

If you are wrong, well, then, only

you will suffer the blows.

BA

...not at all. Bapu has always said

there were two kinds of slavery in

India -- one for women, one for the

untouchables -- and he has always

fought against both.

BOURKE-WHITE

Does it rankle, being separated from

him this way?

BA

Yes... but we see each other in the

day.

BOURKE-WHITE

(delicately)

But not at night...

BA

In Hindu philosophy the way to God

is to free yourself of possessions --

and the passions that inflame to

anger and jealousy.

(A smile.)

Bapu has always struggled to find

the way to God.

BOURKE-WHITE

You mean he -- he gave up --

(how to phrase it,

finally)

married life.

BA

Four times he tried -- and failed.

(Mirabehn and Bourke-

White grin. The older

woman gives a wistful

smile.)

But then he took a solemn vow...

BOURKE-WHITE

And he has never broken it?

BA

(a beat)

Not yet.

MAJOR

I've got permission to move her --

he can go too.

DOCTOR

She's had a coronary throm -- a

serious heart failure. She wouldn't

survive a trip. It's best to leave

her -- and hope.

GANDHI

It is time for my walk -- I won't be

long.

MOUNTBATTEN

We have come to crown victory with

friendship -- to assist at the birth

of an independent India and to welcome

her as an equal member in the British

Commonwealth of Nations.

(A little smile.)

I am here to see that I am the last

British Viceroy ever to have the

honor of such a reception.

JINNAH

I don't give a damn for the

independence of India! I am concerned

about the slavery of Muslims!

JINNAH

I will not sit by to see the mastery

of the British replaced by the mastery

of the Hindus!

GANDHI

(patiently, not yet

believing it can't

be settled)

Muslim and Hindu are the right and

left eye of India. No one will be

slave, no one master.

JINNAH

The world is not made of Mahatma

Gandhis.

(He looks at Nehru

and Patel.)

I am talking about the real world.

NEHRU

The "real India" has Muslims and

Hindus in every village and every

city! How do you propose to separate

them?

JINNAH

Where there is a Muslim majority --

that will be Pakistan. The rest is

your India.

PATEL

(a forced patience)

Mohammed -- the Muslims are in a

majority on two different sides of

the country.

JINNAH

(acidly)

Let us worry about Pakistan -- you

worry about India.

MOUNTBATTEN

Gentlemen, perhaps we should

recommence.

GODSE

(with others)

Death to Jinnah! Death to Jinnah!

GANDHI

Thank God, they've stopped.

GANDHI

I'm your grand uncle but I can still

walk either of you into the ground

and I don't need to be pampered this

way!

GANDHI

Finish your quota of spinning.

HINDU YOUTH

Bapu -- please. Don't do it!

GANDHI

(impatiently)

What do you want me not to do? Not

to meet with Mr. Jinnah?

(Fiercely)

I am a Muslim!

(He stares at them,

then relents.)

And a Hindu, and a Christian and a

Jew -- and so are all of you. When

you wave those flags and shout you

send fear into the hearts of your

brothers.

GANDHI

This is not the India I want. Stop

it. For God's sake, stop it.

JINNAH

Now, please, if you've finished your

prayers, could we begin with business.

GANDHI

My dear Jinnah, you and I are brothers

born of the same Mother India. If

you have fears, I want to put them

to rest.

(Jinnah listens

impatiently,

skeptically. Gandhi

just glances in

Nehru's direction.)

I am asking Panditji to stand down.

I want you to be the first Prime

Minister of India

(Jinnah raises an

eyebrow of interest.)

-- to name your entire cabinet, to

make the head of every government

department a Muslim.

NEHRU

Bapu, for me, and the rest,

(his hand gestures to

Patel and Azad)

if that is what you want, we will

accept it. But out there

(he indicates the

streets)

already there is rioting because

Hindus fear you are going to give

too much away.

PATEL

If you did this, no one could control

it. No one.

JINNAH

It is your choice. Do you want an

independent India and an independent

Pakistan? Or do you want civil war?

BOURKE-WHITE

Aren't you being a little

overprotective?

KALLENBACH

Tomorrow. Tomorrow photograph him.

BOURKE-WHITE

I came all this way because I believed

the picture of Independence Day was

of him here alone.

KALLENBACH

It is violence, and the fear of

violence, that have made today what

it is... Give him the dignity of his

grief.

BOURKE-WHITE

And while we're sitting here feeding

goats, what will happen to all the

Muslims in India and the Hindus in

Pakistan?

KALLENBACH

Gandhi will pray for them...

NEHRU

(fast, curt)

No. There just are not that many

troops.

MILITARY AIDE

What's he to do?

NEHRU

What he can!

NEHRU

He was right. It's insane -- anything

would have been better.

PATEL

Have you found him?

NEHRU

He's in Noakhali.

NEHRU

He's tramping from village to village --

no police, no troops -- trying to

quell the madness single-handedly.

(He sighs, half in

admiration, half in

hopeless exasperation

at the old man's

audacity.)

Maulana has gone to bring him back.

NEHRU'S VOICE

(dull, lifeless)

What you have done in Noakhali is a

miracle, Bapu, a miracle, but millions

are on the move -- millions. There

is no way to stop it... and no one

can count the dead.

NEHRU

In Calcutta it's like civil war. The

Muslims rose and there was a

bloodbath, and now the Hindus are

taking revenge -- and if we can't

stop it there'll be no hope for the

Hindus left in Pakistan.

PATEL

...an eye for an eye making the whole

world blind.

AZAD

Aren't there any troops to spare?

NEHRU

(tense, fragile)

Nothing -- nothing. The divisions in

Bombay and Delhi can hardly keep the

peace now. And each fresh bit of

news creates another wave of  mad...

ness.

PATEL

Could we cut all news off? I know --

NEHRU

Bapu -- please. Where are you going.

GANDHI

(sounding like an old

man)

I don't want to hear more...

PATEL

(impatiently)

We need your help!

GANDHI

There is nothing I can give.

AZAD

Where are you going?

GANDHI

Calcutta.

POLICE COMMISSIONER

Sir, please, I don't have the men to

protect you -- not in a Muslim house.

Not this quarter.

GANDHI

I am staying with the friend of a

friend.

A YOUTH

There he is!

HINDU YOUTH LEADER

(his voice emotional,

tearful)

Why are you staying at the home of a

Muslim! They're murderers! They killed

my family!

GANDHI

Because forgiveness is the gift of

the brave.

YOUTH

To hell with you, Gandhi!!

GANDHI

(to the youth)

Go -- do as your mother and father

would wish you to do.

GANDHI

I have lived a lifetime. If I had

shunned death -- or feared it -- I

would not be here. Nor would you be

concerned for me.

(He lets it sink in

then he takes the

commissioner's arm

and moves back toward

the center of the

roof.)

Leave me -- and take your men.

(An understanding

touch of the arm.)

You have more important things to

worry about.

WOMAN

Bapu... Allah be with you...

GANDHI

And with you.

(He touches her

wrinkled hand.)

Pray... I cannot help you -- pray...

pray.

NEHRU

(angrily)

No! There will not be a Hindu Police

and a Muslim Police. There is one

police!

NEHRU

Why must I read news like this in

the paper?

NEHRU

Tell Patel. Arrange a plane. We will

go -- Friday.

THE AIDE

Four days?

NEHRU

Bapu...

GANDHI

Sardar...

(He looks him over.)

You have gained weight. You must

join me in the fast.

PATEL

(wittily, warmly)

If I fast I die. If you fast people

go to all sorts of trouble to keep

you alive.

NEHRU

Bapu, forgive me -- I've cheated. I

could have come earlier. But your

fast has helped. These last days

people's minds have begun to turn to

this bed -- and away from last night's

atrocity. But now it is enough.

GANDHI

All that has happened is that I've

grown a little thinner.

NEHRU

Tomorrow five thousand Muslim students

of all ages are marching here in

Calcutta -- for peace.

(The real point)

And five thousand Hindu students are

marching with them. It is all

organized.

GANDHI

I'm glad -- but it will not be enough.

NEHRU

Bapu, you are not so young anymore.

GANDHI

Don't worry for me -- death will be

a deliverance.

(There is water in

his eyes, but his

words have the weight

of a man truly

determined to die.)

I cannot watch the destruction of

all I have lived for.

MIRABEHN

Bapu...

GANDHI

Each night before I sleep, I read a

few words from the Gita and the Koran,

and the Bible...

(we intercut with

Bourke-White and

those on the roof

watching)

tonight I ask you to share these

thoughts of God with me.

GANDHI

(the books are there,

but he does it from

memory of course)

I will begin with the Bible where

the words of the Lord are, "Love thy

neighbor as thyself"... and then our

beloved Gita which says, "The world

is a garment worn by God, thy neighbor

is in truth thyself"... and finally

the Holy Koran, "We shall remove all

hatred from our hearts and recline

on couches face to face, a band of

brothers."

MIRABEHN

"Lead Kindly Light, amidst the

circling gloom..."

GANDHI/MIRABEHN

"The night is dark, and I am far

from home, Lead thou me on..."

NEHRU

(hysterically)

Who dares say such things! Who?!

(And he is running at

them and they spread

in fear.)

Come! Kill me first! Come! Where are

you?! Kill me first!

MIRABEHN

His pulse is very irregular -- the

kidneys aren't functioning.

NEHRU

Bapu, I have brought Mr. Suhrawardy.

It was he who called on the Muslims

to rise; he is telling them now to

go back to their homes, to lay down

their arms.

NEHRU

(personally)

Think what you can do by living --

that you cannot do by dying.

NEHRU

(pleadingly)

What do you want?

GANDHI

(a moment)

That the fighting will stop -- that

you make me believe it will never

start again.

NEHRU

...Sometimes it is when you are quite

without hope and in utter darkness

that God comes to the rescue. Gandhiji

is dying because of our madness. Put

away your "revenge." What will be

gained by more killing? Have the

courage to do what you know is right.

For God's sake, let us embrace like

brothers...

GOONDA LEADER

It is our promise. We stop. It is a

promise.

GANDHI

Go -- try -- God by with you.

NAHARI

Eat.

NAHARI

Eat! I am going to hell -- but not

with your death on my soul.

GANDHI

Only God decides who goes to hell...

NAHARI

(stiffening, aggressive)

I -- I killed a child...

(Then an anguished

defiance)

I smashed his head against a wall.

GANDHI

(in a fearful whisper)

Why? Why?

NAHARI

(tears now -- and

wrath)

They killed my son -- my boy!

NAHARI

The Muslims killed my son... they

killed him.

GANDHI

I know a way out of hell.

GANDHI

Find a child -- a child whose mother

and father have been killed. A little

boy -- about this high.

GANDHI

...and raise him -- as your own.

GANDHI

Only be sure... that he is a Muslim.

And that you raise him as one.

GANDHI

(gently, exhaustedly)

Go -- go. God bless you...

CONSTABLE

Yes, sir, yes, sir,

(He holds up his hand

to the senior officer)

"Wait."

CONSTABLE

(writing, from the

phone)

Accident, "Christie crossroads," a

lorry and a rickshaw. Yes, sir, I

have it.

SERGEANT

I wouldn't have believed it, Mr.

Gupta.

SENIOR OFFICER

Sergeant, it's a bloody miracle...

MIRABEHN

Bapu, there's been no fighting --

anywhere. It has stopped -- the

madness has stopped.

GANDHI

It is foolish if it is just to save

the life of an old man.

MIRABEHN

No... no. In every temple and mosque

they have pledged to die before they

lift a hand against each other.

PATEL

Everywhere.

GANDHI

Maulana, my friend, could I have

some orange juice... Then you and I

will take a piece of bread together...

NEHRU

You see, Bapu, it is not difficult.

I have fasted only a few hours and I

accomplished what you could not do

in as many days.

GANDHI

That is how you eat muli.

GANDHI

(to the photographer)

I'm not sure I want to be remembered

that way.

BOURKE-WHITE

Don't worry, with luck you may not

be.

PATEL

No, he'll be remembered for tempting

fate.

ABHA

Mickey Mouse.

BOURKE-WHITE

You really are going to Pakistan,

then?

(Gandhi shrugs, and

she chides too)

You are a stubborn man.

GANDHI

(a grin, in the mood

of their "flirtation")

I'm simply going to prove to Muslims

there, and Hindus here, that the

only devils in the world are those

running around in our own hearts --

and that's where all our battles

ought to be fought.

BOURKE-WHITE

And what kind of a warrior have you

been in that warfare?

GANDHI

Not a very good one. That's why I

have so much tolerance for the other

scoundrels of the world.

GANDHI

Ask Panditji to -- to consider what

we've discussed.

GANDHI

(of the photographs)

Enough.

BOURKE-WHITE

(a plea)

One more.

GANDHI

You're a temptress.

BOURKE-WHITE

Just an admirer...

GANDHI

Nothing's more dangerous, especially

for an old man.

BOURKE-WHITE

There's a sadness in him.

MIRABEHN

He thinks he's failed.

BOURKE-WHITE

Why? My God, if anything's proved

him right, it's what's happened these

last months...

MIRABEHN

I am blinded by my love of him, but

I think when we most needed it, he

offered the world a way out of

madness. But he doesn't see it...

and neither does the world.

GANDHI

Allah be with you.

MANU

(to someone)

Brother, Bapu is already late for

prayers.

GANDHI

Oh, God... oh, God...

MANU/ABHA

Bapu! Bapu!

GANDHI'S VOICE

(weak, struggling, as

he spoke the words

to Mirabehn)

...There have been tyrants and

murderers -- and for a time they can

seem invincible. But in the end they

always fall. Think of it -- always...

When you are in doubt that that is

God's way, the way the world is meant

to be... think of that.

THE END
