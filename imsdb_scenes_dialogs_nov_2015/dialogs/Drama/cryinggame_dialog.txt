JODY

And that's cricket, hon.

JODY

You want it?

GIRL

Sure.

JODY

Doesn't matter if you don't.

JODY

Jody won't be offended. Jody's never

offended. What'd you say your name was?

GIRL

Jude.

JODY

Jude. Suits you, Jude.

JUDE

The teddy bear?

JODY

No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And

it's June. Jude in June.

2.

JODY

Gotta piss, Jude.

JODY

Don't run off, Jude.

JUDE

You don't know me, do you?

JODY

(inside)

What if I did?

JUDE

You'd know I wouldn't run off.

JODY

Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.

JUDE

You didn't?

JODY

And you know what?

JUDE

Tell me, Jody

JODY

It's nice.

JUDE

Not here.

JODY

Who gives a fuck.

JUDE

You never know.

3.

JODY

I never know nothing.

JUDE

People. They could be looking.

JUDE

Come and get me, soldier --

JODY

Whatever you say, Jude...

JODY

What the fuck --

FERGUS

So what's your name, soldier?

4.

JODY

Fuck you.

FERGUS

Yeah.

MAGUIRE

The situation is simple. You're being

held hostage by the Irish Republican

Army. They've got one of our senior

members under interrogation in

Castleraigh. We've informed them that if

they don't release him within three days,

you'll be shot. You'll be treated as our

guest until further developments. Have

you anything to say?

FERGUS

Give him a cup of tea.

MAGUIRE

Do you want a cup of tea?

DISSOLVE.

FERGUS

See does he want some.

JUDE

Do you want some food?

DISSOLVE.

5.

FERGUS

Hey -- what's he like?

JUDE

Horny bastard.

FERGUS

Did you give him it?

JUDE

There are certain things I wouldn't do

for my country.

FERGUS

Have a look at him.

JUDE

Can't.

FERGUS

Poke him or something. See if he's still

alive.

JUDE

He's all right.

FERGUS

Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on.

Have a heart.

JODY

You fucking bitch -- you fucking whore --

MAGUIRE

Turn the fucking thing off --

FERGUS

You all right?

6.

JUDE

Fucking animal.

FERGUS

You don't know that.

JUDE

Fucking do. I had him all over me.

FERGUS

Tough work, that.

JUDE

Someone's got to do it.

JUDE

Nah, it was a breeze. Just thought of

you.

JUDE

And you know what, Fergus? One of you

made me want it...

FERGUS

Which one?

7.

FERGUS

Eat something, would you?

JODY

Can't.

FERGUS

What do you mean you can't?

JODY

Can't eat through a canvas bag.

JODY

This is a farce, man.

FERGUS

How is it a farce?

JODY

I seen your fucking face.

FERGUS

So, what do I look like?

JODY

You're the one about five ten with the

killer smile and the baby face.

FERGUS

Am I?

JODY

Yeah. And the brown eyes.

JODY

You're the handsome one.

JODY

Thank you, handsome.

FERGUS

My pleasure.

8.

JODY

I can't fucking breathe, man. Be a

Christian, will you?

JODY

Tell him to take the hood off, honey...

FERGUS

How did you know it was her?

JODY

I can smell her perfume.

JUDE

See, if we took the hood off, we'd have

to shoot you. As it is, you've got a

fifty-fifty chance.

JODY

Thought you liked me, bitch.

JUDE

It was fun while it lasted.

JODY

Nice lady.

JODY

Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.

FERGUS

Can't we take it off?

JUDE

Have to check with himself.

9.

FERGUS

You look after him.

JODY

Don't leave me with her, man. She's

dangerous...

MAGUIRE

Made the front page. They'll move now,

the fuckers.

FERGUS

Request permission to take the hood off,

Tommy.

MAGUIRE

Why would you do that?

FERGUS

The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.

MAGUIRE

So?

FERGUS

And anyway, he's seen our faces.

MAGUIRE

You sure?

FERGUS

He described me down to a T. Knows what

Jude looks like.

FERGUS

Tommy --

10.

MAGUIRE

You're his keeper. If you don't mind him

seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the

only one he looks at.

FERGUS

Thanks.

MAGUIRE

It's your decision.

FERGUS

Leave us, Judie.

JUDE

My pleasure.

JODY

Thank you, soldier.

JODY

Never thought fresh air would taste this

good.

JODY

Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be

able to feed myself.

FERGUS

No fucking way.

JODY

Only joking.

JODY

You know, I was wrong about one thing.

11.

FERGUS

What's that?

JODY

Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no

pinup.

FERGUS

No?

JODY

Nope. Not handsome at all.

FERGUS

You trying to hurt my feelings?

JODY

No. It's the truth.

FERGUS

Well, I could say the same about you.

JODY

Could you?

FERGUS

But I won't. We're more polite around

these parts.

JODY

So I've noticed.

JODY

Hey --

FERGUS

What is it now?

JODY

You're going to have to do it, aren't

you?

FERGUS

Do what?

JODY

Kill me.

12.

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

13.

FERGUS

Didn't look like that to me...

JODY

She's not my type.

JODY

C'mere.

FERGUS

No.

JODY

Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.

FERGUS

What?

JODY

My inside pocket.

JODY

Take out the wallet.

JODY

Open it.

JODY

Inside. There's a picture.

JODY

No, not that one. There's another.

JODY

Now she's my type.

14.

FERGUS

She'd be anyone's type.

JODY

Don't you think of it, fucker.

FERGUS

Why not?

JODY

She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit

you.

FERGUS

No?

JODY

Absolutely not.

FERGUS

She your wife?

JODY

Suppose you could say that.

FERGUS

You make a nice couple.

JODY

Don't I know it.

FERGUS

So what were you fucking around for,

then?

JODY

You fuckers set me up. That bitch --

FERGUS

She's a friend of mine

JODY

Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar.

I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here

anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my

hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't

like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe

I'll get to understand.

FERGUS

What?

15.

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

(He imitates a Belfast accent)

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

16.

JODY

Well, in Antigua cricket's the black

man's game. The kids play it from the age

of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies

from the age of five. Then we moved to

Tottenham and it was something different.

FERGUS

How different?

JODY

Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .

JODY

So when you come to shoot me, Paddy,

remember, you're getting rid of a shit-

hot bowler.

FERGUS

I'll bear that in mind.

FERGUS

And by the way, it's not Paddy. It's

Fergus.

JODY

Nice to meet you, Fergus.

FERGUS

My pleasure, Jody

FERGUS

Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by

that tree.

JODY

Tree.

JODY

You've got to loosen my hands.

17.

FERGUS

Can't.

JODY

Well then, you're going to have to take

my dick out for me, aren t you?

JODY

Come on, man, I'm going to wet my pants!

JODY

Take the fucker out, man, I'm dying --

JODY

I gotta lean forward or I'll dribble all

over myself. Will you hold my hands for

me.

JODY

Now, that was worth waiting for.

FERGUS

Hurry up, would you?

JODY

These things take time, Fergus.

JODY

It's amazing how these small details take

on such importance...

JODY

Now put it back in.

FERGUS

Give us a break.

18.

JODY

I can't do it! It's only a piece of meat.

For fuck's sake, it's got no major

diseases.

JODY

Thank you. I had a case of the clap two

years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in

all it's served me well.

FERGUS

Shut up, would you?

JODY

I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you,

Fergus.

JODY

Fergus?

FERGUS

Yeah?

JODY

Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.

FERGUS

The pleasure was all mine.

19.

MAGUIRE

What the fuck is this?

FERGUS

It's nothing. He's just got a sense of

humor, that's all.

MAGUIRE

You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth

shut. Go in and get some sleep.

JODY

Yeah. Get some sleep.

FERGUS

Did he talk?

FERGUS

Didn't make you laugh?

FERGUS

Here. Have some breakfast.

20.

JODY

Good morning, Fergus?

MAGUIRE

So he knows your name?

FERGUS

I told him.

MAGUIRE

Are you all there?

FERGUS

Back in a minute, Jody

MAGUIRE

You'll have minimal contact with the

prisoner, do you hear me?

FERGUS

Yes.

MAGUIRE

And do you know why?

FERGUS

Why?

MAGUIRE

Because tomorrow we might have to shoot

him, that's why.

JODY

They giving you trouble, Fergus?

21.

JODY

It happens. Y'see, there's two kinds of

people. Those who give and those who

take.

JODY

Ah, take the thing off, man.

JODY

It's okay. I understand. Don't mind if I

prattle on, do you?

JODY

I will take it by your silence that you

don't.

JODY

Two types, Fergus. The scorpion and the

frog. Ever heard of them?

JODY

Scorpion wants to cross a river, but he

can't swim. Goes to the frog, who can,

and asks for a ride. Frog says, "If I

give you a ride on my back, you'll go and

sting me." Scorpion replies, "It would

not be in my interest to sting you since

as I'll be on your back we both would

drown." Frog thinks about this logic for

a while and accepts the deal. Takes the

scorpion on his back. Braves the waters.

Halfway over feels a burning spear in his

side and realizes the scorpion has stung

him after all. And as they both sink

beneath the waves the frog cries out,

"Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for

now we both will drown?" Scorpion

replies, "I can't help it, it's in my

nature."

22.

FERGUS

So what's that supposed to mean?

JODY

Means what it says. The scorpion does

what is in his nature. Take off the hood,

man.

FERGUS

Why?

JODY

'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.

JODY

See? I was right about you.

FERGUS

Don't be so sure.

JODY

Jody's always right.

JODY

Where would you most like to be now, man?

FERGUS

Doesn't matter where.

JODY

Come on, man. If this shit was all over.

FERGUS

Having a pint in the Rock.

JODY

You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of

something more alluring.

FERGUS

Like what?

JODY

Like having a pint in the Metro --

23.

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

JODY

FERGUS

24.

JUDE

Put that thing back on him, Fergus.

FERGUS

He's hot.

JUDE

Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover

the fucker up.

JODY

Have you no feelings, woman?

JUDE

You shut your face --

JUDE

You're heading for trouble, Fergus --

JODY

He's a good soldier, Jude.

JUDE

I said shut the fuck up --

JODY

He believes in the future --

FERGUS

Is it bad?

JODY

No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know

that, Fergus?

FERGUS

I didn't.

JODY

Some kinds of women are...

25.

FERGUS

She can't help it.

JODY

Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.

FERGUS

You liked her?

JODY

Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever

she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus.

Will you think of her too?

FERGUS

Don't know her.

JODY

Want you to do something, Fergus.

FERGUS

What?

JODY

If they kill me --

FERGUS

Don't think that way.

JODY

But they will. As sure as night follows

day. They have to. I want you to find her

out. Tell her I was thinking of her.

JODY

See if she's all right.

FERGUS

I don't know her.

JODY

Take her picture. C'mere.

JODY

Take it. In the inside pocket.

26.

JODY

Take the whole lot. I won't need it.

FERGUS

I told you not to talk that way --

JODY

Go to Millie's Hair Salon in

Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a

margarita. Don't have to tell her who you

are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --

FERGUS

Stop it --

MAGUIRE

Volunteer?

MAGUIRE

We need you inside.

MAGUIRE

We've had word. They've used every trick

in the book on him. He's starting to

talk. You're going to have to do it in

the morning.

MAGUIRE

You OK about that?

FERGUS

I'm a volunteer, am n't I?

MAGUIRE

Good. I was beginning to have my doubts

about you for the last few days.

JUDE

Not the only one --

27.

MAGUIRE

Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep

tonight, Fergus.

FERGUS

Peter.

MAGUIRE

What?

FERGUS

Request permission to guard the prisoner

tonight --

JUDE

You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.

MAGUIRE

Shut the fuck up, Jude.

MAGUIRE

Why do you want to do that for?

FERGUS

Would make me feel better about it.

MAGUIRE

You sure about that?

FERGUS

I'm sure.

MAGUIRE

Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.

FERGUS

Don't.

JODY

I'm sorry.

28.

JODY

Help me.

FERGUS

How can I?

JODY

I don't know. Just help me. Give me a

cigarette.

JODY

Don't even smoke, you know that? It just

seemed the right thing to do.

FERGUS

Go to sleep now.

JODY

I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.

FERGUS

What?

JODY

A story.

FERGUS

Like the one about the frog?

JODY

And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.

FERGUS

When I was a child...

JODY

Yeah?

FERGUS

I thought as a child. But when I became a

man I put away childish things...

JODY

What does that mean?

29.

FERGUS

Nothing.

JODY

Tell me something, anything.

JODY

Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?

FERGUS

Me? No, I'm not good for much...

FERGUS

Stand up, now --

MAGUIRE

I wish to say on behalf of the Irish

Republican Army --

FERGUS

Leave him be --

JODY

Take the hood off, Fergus --

FERGUS

No.

30.

JODY

I want to see a bit. Please, please.

Don't make me die like an animal.

JODY

I'm glad you're doing it, do you know

that, Fergus?

FERGUS

Why?

JODY

Cause you're my friend. And I want you to

go to the Metro --

FERGUS

Stop that talk now --

JODY

Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?

FERGUS

The fastest.

JODY

Faster than cricket?

FERGUS

Cricket's in the halfpenny place.

JODY

So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat

you, is there?

FERGUS

You won't run.

JODY

But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a

brother in the back --

FERGUS

JODY!!!

31.

FERGUS

You stupid bastard --

JODY

What you say, faster?

FERGUS

I said you bastard -- stop --

JODY

Got to catch me first --

JODY

Used to run the mile, you know -- four

times round the cricket pitch -- what was

that game called?

FERGUS

Hurling --

JODY

What?

FERGUS

Hurling --

JODY

Come on, Fergie -- you can do it -- a bit

more wind --

JODY

Bit of fun, Fergus, eh?

JODY

Told you I was fast --

32.

JODY

Don't do it.

TOMMY

Fergus!

FERGUS

You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're

you keeping?

33.

TOMMY

You'll notice I've asked you nothing.

FERGUS

That's wise, Tommy.

TOMMY

All right, then. I like to be wise.

TOMMY

So what do you need, Fergus?

FERGUS

Need to go across the water.

TOMMY

Do you now.

FERGUS

Need to lose myself awhile.

TOMMY

Aha.

TOMMY

There's a man I know ships cattle to

London.

FADE TO BLACK.

34.

A GIRL

We're closing. I'll see you tomorrow, Dil

DIL

You want something in particular?

35.

FERGUS

Just a bit of a trim...

DIL

Come on...

DIL

Someone recommend you?

FERGUS

In a way.

DIL

Who?

FERGUS

Guy I work with.

DIL

What's his name?

FERGUS

Doesn't the water get to your nails?

DIL

What's it to you?

FERGUS

Nothing.

DIL

You American?

FERGUS

No.

DIL

Not English.

36.

FERGUS

No.

DIL

Scottish?

FERGUS

How'd you guess?

DIL

The accent, I suppose.

FERGUS

And what's it like?

DIL

Like treacle.

DIL

Nice laugh.

DIL

That should make her happy.

FERGUS

Who's she?

DIL

Don't know. Who is she?

37.

BARMAN

Hi, Dil

DIL

Hiya, hon.

BARMAN

What'll it be?

FERGUS

A bottle of Guinness.

DIL

See that, Col?

COL

See what, Dil?

DIL

He gave me a look.

COL

Did he?

DIL

Just cut his hair, you know.

COL

Yeah?

DIL

What you think?

COL

Nice.

DIL

There, he did it again.

38.

COL

Saw that one.

DIL

What would you call it?

COL

Now, that was a look.

DIL

Ask him to ask me what I'm drinking.

COL

She wants to know do you want to know

what she's drinking.

DIL

A margarita.

DIL

Now he can look.... Ask him does he like

his hair, Col.

COL

She wants to know, sir, do you like your

hair.

FERGUS

Tell her I'm very happy with it.

DIL

He's Scottish, Col.

COL

Scottish?

FERGUS

Yeah.

DIL

What'd he say, Col?

39.

COL

He agreed that he was.

DIL

What do you think his name is?

COL

I've no thoughts on the subject.

FERGUS

Jimmy.

DIL

Jimmy?

COL

That's what he said. Jimmy.

DIL

Hi, Jimmy.

FERGUS

Hiya, Dil

MAN

Sing the song, Dil --

DIL

Fuck off, Dave.

DAVE

C'mon, babe! You know what I like...

Easy!

40.

DEVEROUX

So Pat's a cricket fan, eh?

FERGUS

It's not Pat. It's Jim.

DEVEROUX

Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as

you remember you're not at Lords.

41.

COL

So can we consider you a regular, sir?

FERGUS

Is that good or bad?

COL

Well, you get to say, The usual, Col.

Things like that.

COL

So let's call this the usual.

FERGUS

Thanks.

COL

No, no. It's on me.

COL

Take it out, if you want.

COL

You came to see her, didn't you?

COL

Something I should tell you. She's --

42.

FERGUS

She's what?

COL

She's on.

DIL

He's still looking, Col.

COL

Persistent.

DIL

Good thing in a man.

COL

An excellent quality.

DIL

Maybe he wants something.

COL

I would expect he does.

43.

DIL

Ask him.

COL

Ask him yourself.

DIL

So tell me.

DIL

Everybody wants something.

FERGUS

Not me.

DIL

Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned

and quaint. Isn't it, Col?

DIL

You old-fashioned?

FERGUS

Must be.

MAN

Got the money, Dil?

DIL

Fuck off, Dave.

DAVE

You fucking promised.

DIL

Did I?

DAVE

You fucking did.

DAVE

Didn't you? Well, come on!

44.

COL

It takes all types.

FERGUS

So who's he?

COL

He's what she should run a mile from.

FERGUS

Then why doesn't she?

COL

Who knows the secrets of the human heart.

DAVE

Don't be like that --

DIL

You heard me --

DAVE

Got very fucking grand, haven't we --

DAVE

Talk to me, you stupid bitch --

45.

DIL

Hi.

FERGUS

Hi. You forgot your bag.

DIL

Thank you.

DAVE

Who the fuck is he?

DIL

Jimmy.

DAVE

It's him, isn't it?

DIL

Maybe.

DIL

See, they get the wrong idea.

DAVE

(from the ground)

Cunt.

FERGUS

What was that?

DIL

They all get the wrong idea.

DAVE

Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.

DIL

Charming.

FERGUS

What'll I do?

46.

DIL

Break his neck.

DIL

No, don't.

DIL

He's going to take his foot off slowly,

David. Then you're to go home, like a

good boy. You hear me?

DAVE

Cunt.

DIL

Come on, honey.

FERGUS

You all right?

DIL

Yes, thank you.

FERGUS

What was that all about?

DIL

He wants me to perform for him.

FERGUS

Perform?

DIL

You know.

FERGUS

You on the game?

DIL

God no. I'm a hairdresser.

47.

FERGUS

He's getting up.

DIL

You can't leave me then, can you?

DIL

You want me to ask you in, right?

FERGUS

No, I didn't --

DIL

But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud,

but never cheap.

DAVE

Fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt.

DIL

If you kissed me, it would really get his

goat.

DIL

Now, if you asked me to meet you

tomorrow, it would really drive him

insane.

FERGUS

Where?

DIL

Half-five. At Millie's.

48.

DIL

Give me that look again.

FERGUS

What look?

DIL

The one you gave me in the Metro.

DIL

Darling, you shouldn't have.

FERGUS

What's that about?

DIL

They're jealous.

FERGUS

Why?

DIL

I wonder.

DIL

Now's the time you're meant to do

something, isn't it?

FERGUS

Like what?

DIL

Make a pass or something. Isn't that the

way it goes?

FERGUS

Must be.

49.

DIL

You got a special friend, Jimmy?

FERGUS

How special?

DIL

You want one?

FERGUS

Jesus Christ!

DIL

Jesus.

FERGUS

That Dave?

DIL

The things a girl has to put up with.

DIL

I'm frightened, Jimmy. That's not like

him.

DIL

Piss off, Dave!

FERGUS

Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all

right on your own?

DIL

I'm not on my own, am I?

50.

DIL

Come on up, would you?

DIL

Won't hurt you to come in.

DIL

Would you like a drink?

FERGUS

Yes, please.

DIL

What'll it be?

FERGUS

Whiskey.

FERGUS

Someone out there.

DIL

Jesus fucking Christ.

DIL

Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --

DAVE

It's Dave.

DAVE

Talk to me, Dil --

51.

DIL

Sure, Dave --

DAVE

Please, Dil --

DIL

Take your clothes.

DAVE

Don't throw my clothes out the window!

DIL

Fuck off back to Essex!

DAVE

Fucking mad!

DAVE

Don't chuck my clothes out!

DIL

Take your fucking goldfish, too!

DAVE

You fucking bitch!

DAVE

Murderer!

DIL

Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a

brace?

FERGUS

Must be in love to manage that.

DIL

Doesn't know the meaning of the word.

52.

FERGUS

He lived here with you?

DIL

Tried to. Sit down, will you?

FERGUS

What about him?

DIL

He was different.

FERGUS

How different?

DIL

As different as it's possible to be.

FERGUS

Tell me about him.

DIL

No.

FERGUS

Shouldn't I go?

DIL

Yes.

DIL

No --

FERGUS

Did you do that to him?

53.

DIL

You want to know how I kissed him?

FERGUS

Yes...

DIL

Are you jealous of him?

FERGUS

Maybe.

DIL

That's good...

FERGUS

What would he think?

DIL

Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He

was a soldier. Went there like a fool.

FERGUS

Do you miss him?

DIL

What do you think?

FERGUS

I think you do.

DIL

(dreamily)

You say that like a gentleman.

FERGUS

Do I?

DIL

Like you're concerned.

54.

DIL

But you can t stay, you know that?

FERGUS

Didn't think I could.

DIL

A real gentleman...

FERGUS

Shouldn't you be in mourning?

DIL

I am.

DAVE

Look, I'm sorry.

DIL

Fuck off, Dave.

DAVE

No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm

sorry, didn't I?

DIL

Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?

FERGUS

I was only going to ask her for a dance.

FERGUS

Shall we?

55.

FERGUS

Did he come here too?

DIL

Is this an obsession of yours?

FERGUS

Maybe.

DIL

He did sometimes.

FERGUS

Did he dance with you?

DIL

So what do you want with me, Jimmy?

FERGUS

Want to look after you.

DIL

What does that mean?

FERGUS

Something I heard someone say once.

DIL

You mean that?

FERGUS

Yeah.

DIL

Why?

FERGUS

If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

DIL

You're not having me on, are you? 'Cause

Dil can't stand that.

56.

FERGUS

No.

DIL

And she does get very upset...

DIL

One for him, too.

DIL

Drink.

FERGUS

What is this?

DIL

I'm superstitious. Drink.

DIL

Can't leave me now.

FERGUS

Aha.

DIL

The thing is, can you go the distance?

FERGUS

Depends what it is.

DIL

No, depends on nothing.

DIL

In one.

57.

DIL

What you thinking of, hon?

FERGUS

I'm thinking of your man.

DIL

Why?

FERGUS

I'm wondering why you keep his things.

DIL

Told you, I'm superstitious.

FERGUS

Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?

DIL

All the time.

DIL

Even now.

FERGUS

No...

DIL

He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.

DIL

Give me one minute.

58.

FERGUS

Would he have minded?

DIL

You did know, didn't you?

DIL

Oh my God.

FERGUS

Jesus. I feel sick --

DIL

Don't go, Jimmy --

DIL

I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

DIL

What were you doing in the bar if you

didn't know -- I'm bleeding...

59.

DIL

It's all right, Jimmy. I can take it.

Just not on the face.

DIL

Y'see, I'm not a young thing any

longer.... Funny the way things go. Don't

you find that, Jimmy? Never the way you

expected.

FERGUS

I'm sorry.

DIL

You mean that?

DIL

Don't go like that. Say something...

DIL

Jesus.

60.

DIL

He's back, Col

COL

Hi.

DIL

Don't want any of those looks, Col. They

don't mean much.

COL

Stop it, Dil --

DIL

No. Tell him to go fuck himself.

COL

She wants me to tell you go fuck

yourself.

FERGUS

I'm sorry.

DIL

Tell him to stop messing Dil around --

FERGUS

Dil --

DIL

Tell him it hurt --

FERGUS

I have to talk to her, Col --

COL

Says he's got to talk to you --

FERGUS

Come on, Dil --

DIL

Where?

61.

DIL

Tell him again, Col. Go fuck himself --

DEVEROUX

How much did that frame cost, Mr.

Franknum?

FRANKNUM

Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.

DEVEROUX

Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.

FERGUS

Sorry.

62.

DEVEROUX

Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back,

will it, Mr. Franknum?

FRANKNUM

Not in my experience.

DEVEROUX

Off his wages.

FERGUS

Do you mean that?

DEVEROUX

He wants to know do I mean that.

FRANKNUM

I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.

DEVEROUX

Bloody right I do...

DEVEROUX

Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?

FERGUS

She's not a tart.

DEVEROUX

No, of course not, she's a lady.

FERGUS

She's not that either.

DIL

Darling --

63.

DIL

Never let the sun go down on an argument,

Jody used to say.

FERGUS

What you doing here?

DIL

Got your note. So let's kiss and make up,

hon.

FERGUS

Don't call me that.

DIL

Sorry, darling.

FERGUS

Give it over, Dil --

DIL

Apologies, my sweet.

DIL

That's more like it, dear. Have a cuppa.

FERGUS

You're something else, Dil, you know

that?

DIL

Never said a truer word.

DIL

See, I was always best looking after

someone. Must be something in the genes.

FERGUS

Must be.

DIL

And the fact that you didn't know is

basically the fault of yours truly. And

even when you were throwing up, I could

tell you cared.

64.

FERGUS

You could?

DIL

Do you care, Jimmy?

FERGUS

Sure I do.

DIL

You mean that?

FERGUS

Yeah. I care, Dil.

FERGUS

You crying, Dil?

DIL

I'm tired and emotional.

DEVEROUX

Do it on your own time, Paddy.

FERGUS

What?

DEVEROUX

Whatever it is she does for you.

FERGUS

If I was her I'd consider that an insult.

DEVEROUX

Consider it how you like. Just get that

bloody tart out of here.

FERGUS

Did you ever pick your teeth up with

broken fingers?

65.

DEVEROUX

What's that supposed to mean?

FERGUS

It's a simple question.

FERGUS

Come on, dear.

DIL

He didn't answer, honey --

FRANKNUM

Sorry about that, Mr. Deveroux.

DIL

My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.

FERGUS

Shut up.

DIL

Made me feel all funny inside.

FERGUS

I said stop it.

DIL

Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.

FERGUS

You think that's wise?

DIL

Nothing's wise.

FERGUS

I didn't mean to hit you.

DIL

I know that.

66.

FERGUS

Kind of liked you as a girl.

DIL

That's a start.

FERGUS

So I'm sorry.

DIL

Make it up to me, then.

FERGUS

How?

DIL

Ask to meet me again.

FERGUS

Will you meet me again?

DIL

When?

FERGUS

Whenever. Tonight.

FERGUS

Do they know?

DIL

Know what, honey?

FERGUS

Know what I didn't know. And don't call

me that.

DIL

Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her

feelings.

FERGUS

Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.

67.

DIL

Details, baby, details.

FERGUS

So they do know.

DIL

All right, they do.

FERGUS

Don't.

DIL

Sorry.

FERGUS

I should have known, shouldn't I?

DIL

Probably.

FERGUS

Kind of wish I didn't.

DIL

You can always pretend.

FERGUS

That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't

he?

DIL

Absolutely.

FERGUS

Won't be quite the same though, will it?

DIL

Are you pretending yet?

FERGUS

I'm working on it.

FERGUS

There's Dave. He knew too.

DIL

Stop it, Jimmy.

68.

FERGUS

Am I becoming repetitious?

DIL

A little.

FERGUS

Sorry.

FERGUS

Don't ask me in.

DIL

Please, Jimmy.

FERGUS

No. Can't pretend that much.

DIL

I miss you, Jimmy.

FERGUS

Should have stayed a girl.

DIL

Don't be cruel.

FERGUS

Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.

DIL

Only if you kiss me.

FERGUS

Happy now?

DIL

Delirious.

JUDE

Hello, stranger.

69.

JUDE

You vanished.

JUDE

What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the

gaff on us or did you just fuck up?

FERGUS

Leave me alone, Jude.

JUDE

No. That's the last thing I'll do. You

never asked what happened.

FERGUS

I heard.

JUDE

Eddie and Tinker died.

FERGUS

I know.

JUDE

Maguire and me got out by the skin of our

teeth. No thanks to you.... What you

think of the hair?

FERGUS

Suits you.

JUDE

Aye, I was sick of being blond. Needed a

tougher look, if you know what I mean.

JUDE

Fuck me, Fergus.

JUDE

Am I to take it that's a no?

70.

JUDE

We had a court-martial in your absence.

They wanted to put a bullet in your head.

I pleaded for clemency. Said we should

find out what happened first. So what did

happen?

FERGUS

He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back.

I tried to catch him. He made it to the

road and got hit by a Saracen.

JUDE

So you did fuck up.

FERGUS

Yes.

JUDE

But you know what the thing is, Fergus?

FERGUS

No, what is the thing?

JUDE

You vanished quite effectively. Became

Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how

useful that could be.

FERGUS

What do you mean?

JUDE

We've got some plans here. And we'll need

a Mister Nobody to execute them.

FERGUS

No way, Jude. I'm out.

JUDE

You're never out, Fergus.

JUDE

Maybe you don't care whether you die or

not. But consider the girl, Fergus. The

wee black chick.

71.

FERGUS

Leave her out of this.

JUDE

Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche.

You know we won't leave her out of this.

But I'm glad to see you care.

JUDE

And I must admit I'm curious.

FERGUS

What the fuck do you know, Jude?

JUDE

You fucking tell me, boy --

FERGUS

She's nobody. She likes me.

JUDE

So I suppose a fuck is out of the

question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No

sudden moves. And not a whisper to her.

You'll be hearing from us.

JUDE

Keep the faith.

72.

JUDE

He your boyfriend?

JUDE

Lucky you.

DIL

Carnations.

FERGUS

What?

DIL

He'd bring me carnations.

FERGUS

So I got it wrong, then.

DIL

Not at all, honey.

FERGUS

Don't.

DIL

Okay.

FERGUS

Come on.

DIL

Why, honey --

FERGUS

Come on.

DIL

You gonna tell me why?

FERGUS

No.

73.

DIL

What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong

--

FERGUS

Not here.

DIL

You gonna tell me what it is?

JUDE

What was it?

DIL

You know her, Jimmy?

JUDE

Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?

FERGUS

Dil, this is Jude.

DIL

You following me?

JUDE

Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to

you, Dil?

DIL

Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?

JUDE

That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as

they say.

DIL

Absolutely. The younger the better.

Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.

74.

JUDE

Don't go looking for it, Dil.

DIL

Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.

JUDE

A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she,

Jimmy?

DIL

A girl has to have a bit of glamour.

JUDE

Absolutely. Long as she can keep it.

Isn't that right, James...

DIL

It's her, isn't it?

FERGUS

What's her?

DIL

She's the thing you had to tell me.

FERGUS

Kind of.

DIL

I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really

sorry.

DIL

You see that, Col?

COL

Saw it, Dil.

DIL

Fuck it, is what I say.

COL

Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.

DIL

Fucking men, Col --

75.

COL

Fuck 'em.

DIL

And fuck you, Jimmy --

COL

You could always make it up to her.

FERGUS

How?

COL

When a girl runs out like that, she

generally wants to be followed.

FERGUS

She's not a girl, Col --

COL

Whatever you say.

JUDE

She went that way --

JUDE

But you come with me.

76.

FERGUS

So it was you all the time.

MAGUIRE

Who'd you think it was?

FERGUS

I thought it was Dave.

MAGUIRE

And who's Dave when he's at home?

FERGUS

He's at home.

MAGUIRE

Should blow you away, you know that?

FERGUS

I know that.

MAGUIRE

I'm getting emotional. And I don't want

to get fucking emotional -- you

understand, Hennessy?

FERGUS

I understand.

MAGUIRE

Fuck you, too --

JUDE

Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.

MAGUIRE

That true, Fergus? You in love?

FERGUS

Absolutely.

77.

MAGUIRE

And what's she like between the sheets?

FERGUS

Definitely unusual.

MAGUIRE

And who is she?

FERGUS

Just a girl.

MAGUIRE

And you know what'll happen if you fuck

up again, don't you?

FERGUS

Aye, I do, Peter.

MAGUIRE

Good.

MAGUIRE

So what do you think that is, Hennessy?

FERGUS

A hotel?

MAGUIRE

It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh?

He visits his ladies on Tuesday and

Thursday nights and Saturday mornings.

His security's in the car beyond.

FERGUS

Who is he?

MAGUIRE

Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we

would call a legitimate target.

78.

FERGUS

Thank God for that.

MAGUIRE

You being cynical, Hennessy?

FERGUS

Hope not.

MAGUIRE

Good. So what do you think?

FERGUS

Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men

are any good. And I presume you can't get

in.

MAGUIRE

Right.

FERGUS

So it's on the street.

MAGUIRE

Right.

FERGUS

Kind of suicide, isn't it?

FERGUS

But, then, I don't have a choice.

JUDE

Och, you do, Fergie.

FERGUS

Of course. I forgot.

JUDE

Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.

JUDE

You keep your mind on the job, boy --

79.

FERGUS

And then you'll leave her out of it?

JUDE

Aye. Then we'll leave her be.

JUDE

He's arthritic. Takes him two minutes to

get to the door.

FERGUS

And what if I say no?

JUDE

You know what. Go.

GENT

Pardon me, young man --

80.

JUDE

You were made for this.

FERGUS

Was I?

JUDE

Perfect.

FERGUS

And what happens then?

JUDE

We'll be on the other side. We'll move

when you do.

FERGUS

And what if you don't?

JUDE

Fergus, I think you don't trust me.

FERGUS

You may be right.

JUDE

Stay late at your work tomorrow night and

I'll bring you the gear.

FERGUS

Jude?

JUDE

Yes?

FERGUS

Who's the old geezer?

JUDE

Some judge...

FERGUS

Why'd you follow me, Dil?

81.

DIL

Was jealous, Jimmy.

FERGUS

Shouldn't be, Dil

DIL

Why shouldn't I be jealous?

DIL

Don't. My makeup.

DIL

She own you, Jimmy?

FERGUS

Yes.

DIL

She from Scotland too?

FERGUS

You could say that.

DIL

And you're not going to tell me more?

FERGUS

I can't.

DIL

What you doing, Jimmy?

FERGUS

I'm not sure.

DIL

Do you like me even a little bit?

FERGUS

More than that.

82.

FERGUS

Come on, let's go for a walk.

FERGUS

You do something for me, Dil?

DIL

Anything.

FERGUS

You'd do anything for me?

DIL

Afraid so.

FERGUS

You got the keys to the shop?

DIL

You want another haircut, baby?

FERGUS

No. Sit down.

FERGUS

You'd do anything for me?

DIL

Anything.

DIL

No way --

83.

FERGUS

You said anything, Dil

DIL

A girl has to draw the line somewhere --

FERGUS

Want to change you to a man, Dil...

DIL

Why?

FERGUS

It's a secret.

DIL

You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?

FERGUS

Yes.

DIL

And you wouldn't leave me?

FERGUS

No.

DIL

You promise?

FERGUS

I promise.

DIL

Go on, then.

DIL

You're no good at this, Jimmy.

FERGUS

I'm sorry.

84.

DIL

You want to make me look like him...

FERGUS

No. Want to make you into something new.

That nobody recognizes...

DIL

Don't recognize myself, Jimmy.

FERGUS

No.

FERGUS

Better in the dark.

DIL

So it's true, then?

FERGUS

What?

DIL

You like me better like this.

FERGUS

Yes.

DIL

Oh, Jimmy --

FERGUS

No. No. Dil... get up...

85.

DIL

Baby...

DIL

What are you doing, honey...

FERGUS

Don't call me that --

DIL

Sorry. What you doing?

FERGUS

Try this on, Dil

DIL

Why?

FERGUS

For me.

DIL

For you...

DIL

Why are we going here, Jimmy?

FERGUS

Look on it like a honeymoon.

86.

JUDE

You a handyman, Fergie?

FERGUS

I take pride in my work.

JUDE

I sincerely hope so.

JUDE

Tools of the trade.

JUDE

And forget about the girl.

FERGUS

Dil?

87.

FERGUS

Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing

here?

DIL

I'm going home!

FERGUS

Told you to stay in the hotel!

DIL

Thought you was fooling me. Thought you

was leaving me.

FERGUS

I had to go to work!

DIL

Stayed all day in that room thinking

every noise was you. There's something

you're not telling me, Jimmy.

FERGUS

Come on...

DIL

No! I'm going home...

DIL

So tell me.

FERGUS

I was trying to get out of something.

DIL

No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.

88.

FERGUS

You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.

DIL

You mean that?

FERGUS

Yes.

FERGUS

Stop it, would you?

FERGUS

Give it over, Dil, for fuck's sake --

DIL

Sorry. I get nervous. I got this blood

condition. Just help me inside, Jimmy,

then I'll be all right.

FERGUS

You heard what I said, Dil?

DIL

My pills...

FERGUS

What pills?

DIL

Prescription. For my condition.

FERGUS

What condition?

89.

DIL

My condition. Ennui.

FERGUS

Are you supposed to take that many?

DIL

Only in times of extreme stress.

DIL

See, they all say good-bye sometime.

'Cept for him.

FERGUS

Are you all right, Dil?

DIL

I will be.

DIL

Go on, then.

FERGUS

Good-bye, Dil

DIL

Jimmy?

FERGUS

What?

DIL

Don't go like that.

DIL

Can't help what I am.

90.

DIL

Knew you had a heart...

FERGUS

Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your

man.

DIL

You knew which man?

FERGUS

Your soldier.

DIL

You knew my Jody?

FERGUS

Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast.

Held him hostage for three days.

DIL

You knew my Jody?

FERGUS

Are you listening?

DIL

Yes.

FERGUS

I got the order to shoot him. Before I

could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and

died.

DIL

Died...

FERGUS

Did you hear me?

91.

DIL

You killed my Jody?

FERGUS

In a manner of speaking.

DIL

It was you...

FERGUS

You should scream. You should beat my

head off.

DIL

You killed my Jody

FERGUS

No.

DIL

You didn't.

FERGUS

I suppose I tried.

DIL

You tried.

FERGUS

Don't you want to kill me?

DIL

Bang...

DIL

Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me,

too.

FERGUS

Okay.

92.

FERGUS

What the fuck --

DIL

So tell me what you're doing, Jimmy.

DIL

Didn't really listen last night. I heard

but I didn't listen.

93.

DIL

That won't do you no good. Dil knows how

to tie a body.

DIL

Wondered why you came on to me like that

when you gave me the look.

FERGUS

He asked me to see were you all right.

DIL

See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me.

Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.

FERGUS

Stop it, Dil --

DIL

Just don't kick Dil and she'll be

touched. Be nice to her and she'll be

yours forever.

DIL

See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I

can't do that. Yet.

FERGUS

Let me go, Dil

DIL

Why?

FERGUS

Got to be somewhere.

DIL

Try and go, then.

94.

MAGUIRE

Where the fuck is he? Christ --

FERGUS

Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or

they'll be here

DIL

Let them come then.

JUDE

Can't stay here, Peter -- drive around

once more --

DIL

Just want your company for a little while

longer...

MAGUIRE

That fucker's dead --

JUDE

No, we are.

FERGUS

You don't know what you're doing, Dil --

95.

DIL

Never did...

MAGUIRE

Give me the shooter, Jude --

JUDE

You're crazy --

MAGUIRE

Give me the fucking shooter!

DIL

You like me now, Jimmy?

FERGUS

I like you, Dil --

DIL

Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.

FERGUS

More what?

96.

DIL

More endearments.

FERGUS

I like you, DIl

DIL

Love me.

FERGUS

Yes.

DIL

Tell me you love me.

FERGUS

Whatever you say, Dil.

DIL

Then say it.

FERGUS

Love you, Dil.

DIL

You do?

FERGUS

Yeah.

DIL

What would you do for me?

FERGUS

Anything.

DIL

Say it again.

FERGUS

I'd do anything for you, Dil.

97.

DIL

And you'll never leave me?

FERGUS

Never.

DIL

I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice

to hear it.

FERGUS

I'm sorry, Dil.

JUDE

You stupid shit -- Once was bad enough.

But twice.

DIL

You didn't knock, honey --

FERGUS

Dil!

JUDE

Get that thing off me, Fergus --

DIL

What was that she called you, Jimmy?

FERGUS

Fergus.

98.

DIL

What's Fergus?

FERGUS

It's my name, Dil --

DIL

What happened to Jimmy?

JUDE

I said get it off me, Fergus --

DIL

What's she going to do, Jimmy? She going

to blow you away?

DIL

Was she there too? When you got my Jody?

FERGUS

Dil!!!

DIL

I asked you a question, honey -- were you

there too --

JUDE

You sick bitch --

DIL

You was there, wasn't you? You used those

tits and that ass to get him, didn't you?

DIL

She was there, wasn't she?

99.

FERGUS

She was --

DIL

And she used her tits and that cute

little ass to get him, didn't she?

FERGUS

Yes.

DIL

Tell me what she wore.

FERGUS

Can't remember...

DIL

Can't do it, Jimmy. He won't let me.

DIL

You won't let me, Jody --

FERGUS

You've got to go now, Dil --

DIL

Do I?

FERGUS

Yes. Now.

DIL

Am I in trouble, Jimmy?

FERGUS

Not if you go.

DIL

Will I see you again?

FERGUS

You will, Dil

100.

DIL

Promise?

FERGUS

I promise.

DIL

Where am I to go, Jimmy?

FERGUS

The Metro.

DIL

Meet Col --

FERGUS

Yes. Say hello to Col --

FERGUS

You should have stayed at home.

FADE TO BLACK.

DIL

Got you the multivitamins and the iron

tablets, hon --

FERGUS

Don't call me that --
