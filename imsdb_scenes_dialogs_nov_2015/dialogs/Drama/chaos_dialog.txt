BEGIN OPENING CREDITS:

A1   EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE- NIGHT                               A1

CLOSE ON...   A BRONZE PLAQUE which reads, "PEARL STREET

BRIDGE."

ON THE BRIDGE... RAIN POURS DOWN. An SUV steers out of

control and CRASHES into a STALLED OUT VEHICLE.

It's quiet NOW, EXCEPT FOR THE INCESSANT pounding rain.    IN

THE DISTANCE, police lights approach.

SMASH CUT TO:

1    EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT                              1

THROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... The image is GRAINY and

FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY.

POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in

a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on...

The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the

bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand

holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to

his body. His left holds a GUN!

Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man.   ONLY SEE THE

DETECTIVES FROM BEHIND.

A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to

burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the

camera...

KAREN CROSS

... Police on scene are approaching

the suspect. They're at the center of

the Bridge now.

The Man waves his gun wildly, screams at the Detectives.     The

Hostage, tears streaming down her face, SCREAMS OUT!

FADE TO BLACK.

SUDDENLY...   THREE GUN SHOTS, almost simultaneously, RING

OUT!

SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004         2.

KAREN CROSS (OS)

We have shots fired. Shots have been

fired... Both the suspect and his

hostage are down... Police are moving

in... Oh my God.

FADE IN:

2    INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                 2

A loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS,

HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not

watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND

TONIC, is...

DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His

charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much

trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood.

The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face.

IN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE:

most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.)

KAREN CROSS (OS)

After a two month investigation, Det.

Jason York has been relieved of duty

for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge

shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John

Curtis. Key testimony against York

came from Det. Bernard Callo, who was

on scene that night. The Seattle

Police Department is handing this case

over to the King County District

Attorney's office. Criminal charges

are expected.

3    ON A TELEVISION SCREEN--                                       3

The IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN

MARTIN JENKINS, 50's, chronically tired and unsympathetic.

JENKINS

In a civilized society, the men and

women entrusted with serving and

protecting the community are to be held

accountable just like everyone else.

Simply put... Just because you are a

cop, doesn't mean laws don't apply to

you. This is no longer the wild, wild

west.

3A   EXT.   KING COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY (THROUGH TV CAMERA)      3A

KAREN CROSS stands on the steps, a PHOTO of Conners appears.

SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004            3.

KAREN CROSS

This same review board last week found

Quentin Conners, Det. York's partner,

"not responsible" for the same

shooting. He remains on suspension

without pay.

3B   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                    3B

Conners turns off the TV, lays the remote next to a PHOTO of

Conners and a YOUNG WOMAN (TEDDY) during happy times. He

stares at the photo, finishes his drink.

FADE TO BLACK.

END OPENING CREDITS.

4    EXT.   SEATTLE - DAY - ESTABLISHING                               4

A COOL, CRISP Pacific Northwestern day. MOUNT RAINIER looms

in the distance. The SPACE NEEDLE overlooks downtown. While

the sun shines now, the OVERCAST SKY on the horizon

FORESHADOWS AN IMPENDING STORM. In the heart of the city...

5    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                               5

An IMPRESSIVE STRUCTURE on a BUSY CITY CORNER. TRAFFIC,

street and pedestrian, go about their business.

ACROSS THE STREET...   A BLACK TRUCK screeches to a stop.

6    INT.   BLACK TRUCK - DAY                                          6

LORENZ, 40's, sits behind the steering wheel. His EYES cold,

merciless. He's joined by FOUR OTHER MEN, ALL BLACK CLAD -

HEAVILY ARMED with BODY ARMOR!

Lorenz stares out at the bank, a last moment of peace.

Simultaneously, ALL FOUR DOORS OPEN and...

7    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                               7

Lorenz and the Black Clad exit, quickly cross the street,

heading for the bank! Each carries a LARGE BLACK BAG.

7A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                             7A

PATRONS in line, wait impatiently. A SECURITY GUARD in the

corner yawns. TELLERS count out cash, access accounts on

COMPUTERS.

GRAINY SECURITY CAMERA IMAGES depict an average, business

day. THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.

SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004             4.

7B   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                               7B

Lorenz and the Black Clad arrive at the doors.     They RAISE

THEIR MASKS and...

8    INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                             8

Off the CROOKED EYEBROW of a BANK TELLER...

AT THE FRONT DOORS--

The BLACK CLAD STORM THE BANK! Four of the Black Clad move

into position. Lorenz stands center stage. Gun in hand, he

aims at the ceiling, PULLS the trigger... BAM! A GUNSHOT

RINGS OUT!

LOREN

Drop to the floor! Slowly! No sudden

moves!

(to the Tellers)

You! Hands on heads, drop to your

knees. Now! Do it!

PATRONS and TELLERS HIT THE GROUND, TERRIFIED!     Lorenz is in

COMPLETE and UTTER CONTROL.

BLACK CLAD #4 and #3 keep watch on the tellers behind the

counters! One on one side, one on the other.

BLACK CLAD #2 ushers people out of side offices, gun-points

them into the lobby!

BLACK CLAD #1 races upstairs, gathers people from the 2nd

level, forces them downstairs.

From the corner of Lorenz's eye...      The SECURITY GUARD's hand

creeps toward his gun.

LORENZ

That... you don't want to do.

The Security Guard reluctantly obeys. BLACK CLAD #1 DISARMS

the Guard, then GUN BUTTS HIM over the head! The Guard

drops, unconscious! CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES scream out.

Black Clad #1 rips keys from the Guard's belt, tosses them to

Black Clad #2!

LORENZ

Y'all picked the wrong day not to use

the ATM.

(Beat)

You will not be harmed if you do

exactly what I say, when I say it. You

LORENZ (cont'd)

listen.

LORENZ

No one will say I didn't give you a

choice.

LORENZ

You, up.

(the Bank Manager obeys)

You understood what I just said?

BANK MANAGER

Yes.

LORENZ

Your security system, you can

electronically lock all entrances...

BANK MANAGER

Yes.   Right-right away.

LORENZ

With that attitude, you and I are going

to get along famously. Now go.

10A   INT.   BANK MANAGER'S OFFICE                                10A

BANK MANAGER

It's done.     We're locked down.

JENKINS

JENKINS

This was fun. You should get out of

bed. You'll be late for work.

LORENZ

What do you think you're doing?

BLACK CLAD #4

Fucker pushed the alarm.

LORENZ

It would've made more sense to shoot

him before he pushes the fucking alarm.

Not after.

(looks at the Eager Teller)

Jesus.

LORENZ

And... If you're going to do something.

(FIRES his weapon!)

Do it right.

LORENZ

(into microphone)

Alarm's tripped. We're on a clock.

(to Black Clad #4)

Get these people out of the way.

This is Detective Galloway.

16    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                                16

CALLO

(into his radio)

I want all points of entry identified

and covered. We need SWAT here now.

Have emergency crews standing by!

OFFICER AT BANK

(re: the Media)

Didn't take them long.

CALLO

Set a perimeter.    Move'em back.

OFFICER AT BANK

How far?

CALLO

Portland.

18   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                              18

Callo arrives at the POLICE TECH VAN.    So state-of-the-art

NASA is green with envy.

BRENDAN DAX, 30's, the techno-wizard, with headphones on,

hands Callo a phone. Several other OFFICERS listen in.

DAX

We have them on the line.

Dax presses a series of buttons.

DAX

We're hot.

CALLO

(into phone)

This is Detective Callo, Seattle P.D.

Who am I speaking with?

LORENZ

No questions. It's time to set the

rules. I am in complete control of

this facility. No one gets in or out

without my say and I will execute every

last man, woman and child in here if my

needs are not met. Do not test me.

Today, I am a man of zero patience.

CALLO

I'm listening.

LORENZ

See if you can't screw this up,

Detective... I have but one demand.

One and only demand.

20   INT.   CONNERS APARTMENT - DAY                                   20

Conners wears a T-shirt and some sweats, opens his

refrigerator, grabs a bottle of water. When he closes the

door... He notices Jenkins and a YOUNG DETECTIVE on his

deck.

Conners crosses, opens the door for Jenkins and DETECTIVE

SHANE DEKKER, late-20s. Dekker's all business when it comes

to being a cop. Green, but eager to prove himself. After a

long beat...

CONNERS

Do you have a warrant?

SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004              10.

JENKINS

I need to speak to you, Quentin.

CONNERS

There's where your shit out of luck

because I don't need to speak to you.

JENKINS

It's important.

Conners and Jenkins trade serious stares. Conners finally

relents. Jenkins and Dekker enter. Dekker notices - THE

STACKS AND STACKS OF BOOKS.

JENKINS

Quentin, this is Detective Shane Dekker.

CONNERS

Huh? You don't look like much of a

Detective.

DEKKER

Funny. I was going to say the same

about you.

CONNERS

Charming.

JENKINS

Shane just transferred in from Tacoma.      His

father...

CONNERS

Save your breath. I really don't care.

Before Jenkins can respond, from the bedroom, a TALL, BLOND

WOMAN, 20s, emerges, COMPLETELY NUDE.

The men WATCH as the Woman, PAYING THEM NO ATTENTION,

retrieves a bottle of water from the fridge, then returns to

the bedroom. No words spoken at all. After the moment has

passed...

CONNERS

Why don't we can the chit-chat.    Get to

what's on your mind.

JENKINS

We've got a hostage situation, American

National Bank. The sonsabitches said

they wouldn't talk to anyone but you.

CONNERS

No shit?

SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004            11.

JENKINS

No shit.   I need you to do this.

CONNERS

Why should I?

DEKKER

Because people's lives are at stake.

That takes priority over your ego.

CONNERS

(to Jenkins; re: Dekker)

You may want to put a leash on him.

(beat; thinks)

Saying I did want to help... I'm still

suspended or did that slip your mind?

JENKINS

The commissioner's office has ordered

me to reinstate you. As of now, you're

back on the force.

CONNERS

Just like that?

JENKINS

Just like that.

(beat)

I won't, however, unleash you alone.

CONNERS

Always a catch.

JENKINS

Shane, here, is your new partner.

Consider him a younger version of me,

looking over your shoulder, watching

every move you make.

The idea of a new partner doesn't sit well with Conners.

JENKINS

Don't think I endorse this. If it were

my call, you'd be with your partner...

CONNERS

You mean ex-partner.

JENKINS

... On the unemployment line with him.

CONNERS

For a moment there, I thought you

cared.

JENKINS

I care about those innocent people down

there. I hope to God someone hasn't

made a monumental mistake letting you

back in.

CONNERS

I appreciate the words of encouragement

and the confidence you have in me. I

look forward to the continuing,

positive relationship we've shared in

the past.

POLICE CORRAL the ever-growing group of SPECTATORS.

A SWAT TRUCK pulls up, the BACK DOORS FLY OPEN!     SWAT exit in

a flurry, race into position.

Amidst the commotion... JENKINS' CAR navigates the scene,

stops next to... KAREN CROSS immediately recognizes Conners,

orders her CAMERAMAN to center on him.

Conners, Dekker and Jenkins climb out of the car, head

towards the crime scene, when...

KAREN CROSS

Detective Conners? Detective, can we

have a few words?

Conners turns, recognizes Karen.    Relishing the moment...

CONNERS

I'll give you two...

(pauses for effect)

Blow me. If you need a follow-up

comment let me know?

(to Dekker)

Cunt made her career off me.

AT THE POLICE TECH VAN--

SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004         13.

Conners, Dekker and Jenkins arrive, FIND Teddy, her hair

still wet, with her partner, DET. VINCENT DURANO, 40's, a

middle of the road, never out on a limb type cop.

Callo looks on, the RAGE boiling inside of him.

CONNERS

Teddy, Vincent...

(completely ignores Callo)

... Nice to see you both.

JENKINS

Conners has been reinstated to full

active duty. It's his scene.

This info comes as a surprise.   Especially to Callo.

CALLO

The last hostage situation this guy

headed, an innocent civilian died.

CONNERS

I was not responsible...

CALLO

You never are. That girl would be

alive today if it weren't for your

cowboy antics. You destroy lives.

CONNERS

Fuck you. Look who's talking about

destroying lives.

JENKINS

Decision's been made, Bernie.

CALLO

I was first on scene and I have seniority.

(pleads)

Don't do this, Martin.

JENKINS

We'll talk about it later.   Take a hike.

CALLO

(beat)

Fine. I'll watch this train wreck from

home.

Callo exits.

CONNERS

(sarcastic)

I'm going to miss him.

JENKINS

SWAT, because of the special

circumstances will defer to Conners.

He's in charge.

VINCENT

First time I've heard SWAT defer to

anyone.

JENKINS

(pulls aside Conners)

Second chances don't come around often.

Don't blow it.

Jenkins skeptically eyes Conners before stepping away.     He

motions for Dekker to walk with him.

JENKINS

Anything questionable happens today,

you let me know.

DEKKER

Yes, Captain.

Out of earshot, Conners watches Dekker and Jenkins.

TEDDY

Looks like you got yourself a baby-

sitter.

Conners glares at Teddy out the corner of his eye, then

dismisses the comment.

TIME CUT TO:

More SPECTATORS, more MEDIA.

Conners, Dekker, Teddy and Vincent hover behind the first

barricade. Conners unwraps gum, sticks it in his mouth.

VINCENT

We have approximately four to seven,

heavily armed men holding an

unspecified number of customers and

employees hostage.

CONNERS

You're just a wealth of knowledge,

aren't you?

TEDDY

Witnesses heard shots fired and some

kind of explosion. And their only

demand has been to speak with you.

CONNERS

I'm sure it won't be the last. Get me

a line into the bank. Let's see what

they really want.

Detective Conners?

INTERCUT WITH:

29   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                             29

Conners and company gather outside of the Police Tech Van.

Dekker pulls a pad and a pen, prepares to take notes.

Dax sits, headphones donned, records the entire conversation.

CONNERS

Who am I speaking with?

LORENZ

For now...     You can call me Lorenz.

Dekker writes, "Lorenz."

CONNERS

Okay, Lorenz, how are we doing in there?

Can we get you anything? Food, medical

supplies. We heard an explosion.

LORENZ

Everyone who matters is fine. Of course,

I would've preferred not having the

authorities involved at all. We weren't

planning to be here this long. But, since

Seattle's finest needs a presence on the

scene, I'm glad it's you.

SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004         16.

CONNERS

My fame proceeds me.

LORENZ

Don't be flattered. I needed someone

who's been through the experience

before. Hopefully this time it will go

better for all involved. I plan on

living a full, long and rich life. I

didn't, however, expect them to find

you so quickly. I thought you were

suspended.

Dekker writes, "In The Know," on his pad.

CONNERS

I was, but I'm back.   You're

information's old.

LORENZ

You never get what you pay for.

(back to business)

You want to know about the hostages?

How many and are they okay?

Dekker scribbles, "Pro".

CONNERS

Yes.

LORENZ

Approximately forty, they're fine,

considering. All except one. We had a

situation.

CONNERS

Someone's dead?

LORENZ

Theory... put to practice isn't always

perfect. Can't expect to keep the

hostages in check if a bad deed goes

unpunished or they may... randomly

decide to revolt. Chaos... has some

order to it.

(Conners drifts in thought)

Detective? Are you still with me?

Teddy SNAPS her fingers. That gets Conners attention.

There's a new intensity to his demeanor.

CONNERS

What else will I be looking for?

LORENZ

Demands... Probably too much to ask

for you and your colleagues to pack up

and go home?

CONNERS

Safe to say.

LORENZ

Stay by the phone.    I'll contact you

shortly.

CONNERS

Lorenz...

LORENZ

Don't worry, I have no plans until

sunrise tomorrow, so hunker down. It's

going to be a long one.

CONNERS

Wait, we're talking here...

LORENZ

Patience, Detective. We don't want

another Pearl Street Bridge, do we?

Conners's thrown by the mention of Pearl Street Bridge.

Lorenz abruptly HANGS UP.

DAX

He's off.

30   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                             30

TELEVISION CAMERA... Karen Cross reports:

KAREN CROSS

This standoff is approaching two hours

now. We've been told Detectives have

made contact with the perpetrators

inside the bank. Whether any specific

demands have been made, we cannot

confirm. As soon as we know something,

we'll pass it on to you. Reporting

live, Karen Cross, channel two news.

CAMERAMAN (OS)

We're clear.

He's not picking up.

CONNERS

Where's our fearless Captain?

DEKKER

Went uptown to brief the Commissioner.

CONNERS

So you're here in his place.

CONNERS

Nicotine gum.

TEDDY

(shock)

You quit smoking?

CONNERS

Caffeine, too, if you must know.

(Another shock)

What? A man's capable of change.

TEDDY

A man, yes. You...     I'm not so sure.

Don't worry, I still have a vice or two.

DAX

Fifteen rings.    No answer.

CONNERS

Try again in five.

TEDDY

What are they doing in there?

VINCENT

Wasting our time.

Time. The word rings in Conners's head.     He starts to put it

together.

CONNERS

Precisely. He knows police protocol,

not to mention the shit in our own

precinct. He's disguising his voice,

means he's got a record and has done

this before. He's heavily armed and

well-connected. He knows he's

surrounded. He hasn't asked for a

damned thing. He drops that hint about

sunrise, prepping us for a long wait.

He's buying time. Why?

VINCENT

(brainstorming)

To figure out his next move.    He wasn't

expecting us.

DEKKER

No, he wasn't expecting you. He said,

he thought you were still suspended.

CONNERS

Probably thought it would take the

whole day for you to find me. Giving

him the time he needs.

TEDDY

He's stalling.

DEKKER

He almost has what he came for.

Conners nods, eyes Dekker as if for the first time.

SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004       20.

CONNERS

Or... he's got what he came for and he's

waiting for his ticket out of here.

(the decision)

We're going in.

TEDDY

What?

CONNERS

The bank has three points of entry.

Teddy and Vincent, take a SWAT Team,

head to the West side. We'll have the

SWAT Commander take the East. Dekker,

you're with me. Where is the SWAT

Commander?

VINCENT

I'll find him.

Vincent leaves Conners with Dekker and Teddy.

TEDDY

(to Conners; concern)

That's a big call, Quentin.   Thought

about what you're doing?

CONNERS

You questioning me, Teddy?

TEDDY

Unfortunately... yeah.

CONNERS

I question how you can fuck that

asshole and still manage to look in the

mirror.

TEDDY

I'm not going to get into this now.

And you're one to talk. I hear...

CONNERS

(interrupting)

The hostages are in imminent danger.

They've confessed to killing someone, an

automatic murder one charge - that's a

life sentence, maybe a needle for all of

them. So why keep witnesses around to

testify? Longer we wait, the greater the

risk. We need to go in. Now.

TEDDY

(beat; then relents)

Okay.

Even Dekker seems to agree with that theory. Vincent arrives

with the SWAT COMMANDER, 40's, a former Navy SEAL with a

"Don't FUCK with me" attitude.

SWAT COMMANDER

I got snipers up top and ten soldiers

on the ground.

CONNERS

What's the best way in?

SWAT COMMANDER

Tear gas, blow the doors...

CONNERS

Hold on. No explosives. I got forty

civilians in there, too great a chance.    Any

other way?

SWAT COMMANDER

There's no pussy way in. The doors are

locked electronically from the inside.

We ain't getting in without force.

CONNERS

(beat; thinks)

What if we cut the power? That will

disable the system and we can open the

locks manually, come in that way?

SWAT COMMANDER

(thinks; concedes)

That'll work.

CONNERS

So we'll take the pussy way, Commander.

We cut the power and go in at 11:15

sharp!

TIME CUT TO:

Conners and Dekker slip into bulletproof vests.     Teddy,

Vincent and the SWAT Commander arrive.

TEDDY

The bank's equipped with emergency

generators, which once the power's

down, will kick back on in

approximately 3-6 minutes.

CONNERS

It will be over before that.

Commander, your men in position?

SWAT COMMANDER

Standing by.

CONNERS

I will call for the power to be cut.

Once down, wait for my signal and

enter. No one moves until I give the

"go", understood?

They all nod.    They're ready.

CONNERS

You have done this before, right?

Wait... I don't want to know.

VARIOUS SHOTS of HOSTAGES. It's quiet, until... Black Clad

They put up some fight, but quickly concede.

The hostages sit shaking, crying...    Scared beyond belief.

Behind a barricade, Conners crouches down beside Dekker and

his SWAT Team.

CONNERS

Let's go around the horn.

36   ON THE WEST SIDE--                                              36

THE HOSTAGES grab each other TIGHTLY.   PANIC evident.   Lorenz

and the Black Clad calmly react.

Conners and Dekker head for the bank, pass two groups of FOUR

UNIFORMED OFFICERS...

DEKKER

(to the first group)

Round up all the hostages, anyone that

comes out, grab'em!

Conners glares at Dekker.

CONNERS

(to the second)

The rest of you, come with us.

The OFFICERS rush to protect the HOSTAGES, pull them to

safety. CAMERA CREWS and REPORTERS pounce on the

opportunity.

Conners and Dekker lead the charge inside, guns drawn.

51   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                              51

EMERGENCY LIGHTS BURN! GLASS CRACKLES UNDER FOOT as Conners,

Dekker and the Officers move through. Caution with each

step.

The lobby's clear.   Conners pulls the Officers close.

CONNERS

(whispers; to Dekker)

We split up.

(whispers; to the officers)

You two with him. You two with me.

(to Dekker)

Check the back.

Dekker nods, leads his group away.      Conner proceeds...

52   BEHIND THE COUNTERS--                                              52

Nothing. Conners spots a DOOR in the back marked, "Bank

Employees Only."

53   THE VAULT--                                                        53

Dekker checks it out, but it's empty. The remnants of the

explosion remain. Suddenly... THE GENERATORS ROAR TO LIFE!

THE POWER BLINKS BACK ON!

Dekker jumps, startled by the sudden blast of lights.

No.   No one went by me.

Detectives... We found these.

CONNERS

We let them walk right past us.

SHIT!

57   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                         57

Vincent, covered in debris, confers with Conners.

VINCENT

We got the one Teller dead, the two

that were strung up are alive, but in

critical condition. A few SWAT

incurred 2nd degree burns, but that's

the worst of it. Now, depending on who

you talk to... there was anywhere from

five to nine perps. And nobody got a

good look at any of'em, wore their

masks the whole time. Dax is rounding

up the security tapes now. That should

give us a firm number.

CONNERS

I want background checks on every

hostage. They're all suspects until

they're not.

VINCENT

You don't think one of them's still

here?

CONNERS

After this, nothing would surprise me.

58   EXT.   TECH VAN - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                58

Dax pulls cables, power cords, etc., getting set to go inside

with them. Dekker approaches.

DEKKER

Excuse me... I need to listen to the

conversation between Lorenz and Conners

again?

DAX

It'll have to wait.

DEKKER

How long?

DAX

Hour.   Maybe more.

DEKKER

(too long)

Show me how to play it myself?

DAX

Look, this isn't how it works. I don't

take orders from you. I don't know you

and NO ONE touches my stuff. You're

going to have to wait.

Dax gets his shit, starts to go. Dekker waits, then proceeds

into the van. Dax turns, notices.

59   INT.   TECH VAN                                              59

Dekker inspects the equipment, when...

DAX

What the hell are you doing?

DEKKER

Along with whatever they stole and this

war zone they left behind... A man's

dead, and the killers are running free.

I don't have time to wait.

(looks at the equipment)

I'll figure it out. Thanks for your

help.

DAX

(relents, demonstrates)

Here. This DAT machine. Play, stop,

rewind... It's just like using a tape

player. Headphones are jacked in.

Tape's already inside.

DEKKER

Thank you.

60   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                          60

A CAR PULLS UP... Jenkins steps out. Stares out over the

scene, the mess. He's a volcano ready to erupt.

61   INT.   SECURITY ROOM - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                61

A SERIES OF EIGHT BLACK AND WHITE VIDEO MONITORS... as we

rewind. SEVEN of the eight show recorded images of the bank.

The eighth shows only STATIC. Dax sits in front of the

monitors. Conners stands nearby.

CONNERS

(re: the eighth monitor)

What's with this one?

DAX

That's the camera in the vault.      It

blew in the first explosion.

The SEVEN DIFFERENT MONITORS all begin in sync.

ON SCREEN... TIMECODE burns in the corner. The HOSTAGES are

dragged across the LOBBY, where the Black Clads hook them up

to the pulleys. The Black Clads get into position.

Conners CAREFULLY scrutinizes the images.

ON SCREEN... THE TIMECODE CLOCK:    Hits "11:15:00 AM" and...

STATIC FILLS THE SCREENS!

DAX

That's when you cut the power.

CONNERS

So we can't ID them.

DAX

There's a four minute, fifty-two second

gap, before the image returns. But...

CONNERS

They're long gone by then.

(beat; thinks)

Go to the head of the tapes, from when

they first went in. Document each move

they've made for the two hours they

were inside.

DAX

You got it. Hey... Awful lotta news

cameras outside. Maybe one got a look

at them coming out?

CONNERS

(good idea)

Have Vincent check it out.

Teddy enters...

TEDDY

Conners, you better come out here.

62   INT.   LOBBY                                                    62

Conners and Teddy walk in to discover...    Captain Jenkins

confers with FOUR FBI AGENTS in suits.

CONNERS

(to Teddy)

Shit. Feds.

Jenkins turns to Conners, gestures him over.

JENKINS

Detective Conners, join us, would you?

63   INT.   TECH VAN                                               63

Dekker listens through HEADPHONES makes notes as he goes.

CONNERS (VO)

(beat; stern)

What does that mean?

LORENZ (VO)

Theory... put to practice isn't always

perfect. Can't expect to keep the

hostages in check if a bad deed goes

unpunished or they may... randomly

decide to revolt. Chaos... has some

order to it.

Dekker, hits STOP, then REWIND.     He checks his...

IN HIS NOTEBOOK--

Several words and phrases fill the page. "Lorenz, sunrise,

Pro Theory, 40 hostages, Theory, Randomly Revolt, and Chaos."

DEKKER studies the words intently, figuring something out.

He presses PLAY on the DAT machine.

LORENZ (VO)

Theory... put to practice isn't always

perfect. Can't expect to keep the

hostages in check if a bad deed goes

unpunished or they may... randomly

decide to revolt. Chaos... has some

Dekker presses STOP. Dekker finds a pattern, circles the

words, "Lorenz, Chaos, Theory."

64   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                         64

Conners, Jenkins and Teddy converse with AGENT VICTOR DOYLE,

40's, and the BANK MANAGER still a bit rattled.

AGENT DOYLE

Prince Amar Alle Alban is one of the

wealthiest and least popular Arabs in

the Middle East. There's been

countless threats on his life and

fortune in the past. But for better of

worse... he is an ally to the United

States. The Prince keeps a safe

deposit box in twenty institutions

SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004     32.

AGENT DOYLE (cont'd)

across the country. Along with this

bank, he also had a box at Eastern

Federal Savings in Charlotte, North

Carolina, which was hit last month.

Same M.O.

TEDDY

What was in the box?

BANK MANAGER

We don't keep records. The boxes are

private. Since 9/11, we screen for

live tissue, viruses or explosives, but

if it passes those tests, we don't ask.

CONNERS

This is all real fascinating shit, but

what about the money? Bank robbers

still like cash, don't they?

BANK MANAGER

The cash drawers don't appear touched.

Neither does the cash vault.

TEDDY

So they broke into a bank and didn't

steal any money?

Odd glances all about.

AGENT DOYLE

We believe the Prince's box was the

target. We're trying to reach him now.

JENKINS

Thank you.

Agent Doyle and the Bank Manager leave.

JENKINS

Helluva come back, Conners. Are you

familiar with the term franchise-sized

fuck-up...

CONNERS

Depends, are we talking about your sex

life? Because I've heard shortcomings.

JENKINS

You got played, Quentin.

Congratulations, you just topped Pearl

Street Bridge.

SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004        33.

TEDDY

That's not fair. It was by the book.

Everything was according to standard

procedure.

CONNERS

You came to me. I didn't ask for this.

JENKINS

Commissioner's office is scrambling to

cover their ass. They need a

scapegoat... And I have zero problems

serving you up.

CONNERS

You wanted this to happen.

JENKINS

No. But if it had to happen to

somebody.

64A   EXT.   AT THE TECH VAN - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY      64A

DEKKER

I think this Lorenz was trying to tell

us something.

CONNERS

You don't say.

DEKKER

The way he spoke... he paused before

certain words. Have you ever heard of

the Chaos Theory?

CONNERS

What?

SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004             34.

DEKKER

Edward Lorenz invented the Chaos Theory

in the 1960's. It's the study of

phenomena that appear random, but in

fact have an element of regularity

which can be described mathematically.

CONNERS

(confused)

Try that again?

DEKKER

Pretty much... initial state of events

may seem unrelated and random, but

eventually patterns emerge and in the

end all the pieces fit together.

The Waitress refills Conners' coffee, lays down the check.

WAITRESS

Anything else, officers?

CONNERS

That'll be all.

(to Dekker)

You're a College boy. Which one?

Someplace I've heard of or one of those

inbred state schools no one's heard of?

DEKKER

U Dub.

CONNERS

Not exactly Princeton, but not bad.

How did you end up on the force?

DEKKER

It's kind of the family business.

CONNERS

Family business? What, your Dad, Dad's

Dad and so on and so back?

Dekker squirms when it comes to revealing personal info.

DEKKER

Do we really need all this "get to know

you" crap? Couple hours ago you didn't

give a shit.

CONNERS

You've grown on me. Besides, I am

entrusting my life to you. I should

know something about you. I would

SHOOTING SCRIPT                    MARCH 15, 2004          35.

CONNERS (cont'd)

think you'd like to know a little

something about me.

DEKKER

I know about you, Detective.      Everyone

does.

CONNERS

You don't say that with much

enthusiasm.

DEKKER

Not much to be enthusiastic about.

Conners reaches his limit.      Time to put him in place.

CONNERS

Listen, my reputation often proceeds me.

You, however, have no reputation; a fact I

need to deal with. After you've been

through the shit I have, then you can judge

me. Now... we can try to work together,

make the best of a bad situation or we can

compare Dick sizes all day... Up to you.

But since this is your first day here...

today... mine's bigger.

VINCENT (VO)

Conners, come in?

Both men hold steely stares on one another.     Until...

CONNERS

Go.

VINCENT (VO)

Got something you'll want to see.

Conners drops a TEN DOLLAR BILL on the table.

CONNERS

Lastly... I don't like the Pac-10.

It's overrated. I'm an Ivy League guy.

Conners gets up, heads for the door.

Dekker, humbled, scoops up Conners's ten, puts it in his

wallet and drops a twenty down on the table, slides out of

the booth.

VINCENT

He gave up his partners and cut a deal

Gotta love the system.

CONNERS

Only thing on file is in Spokane, but I

complex.

TWO POLICE OFFICERS along with Conners, Dekker, Teddy and

his fist on the door...

VINCENT

Gina, it's the police.    Open up.

There's no response.   But SOUNDS can be heard on the opposite

side of the door.

VINCENT

(Pounds louder)

We can hear you.

Again no response.   It's quiet.    Too quiet.

CONNERS

Step back. Clear the door.     Now.

Just as Vincent does...

BAM! A GUNSHOT BLOWS APART THE DOOR!     Fired from the inside

of the apartment!

BAM! BAM! BAM! The BLASTS KEEP COMING!          Everyone's pinned

down, on the defensive.

(to Conners; re: Richards)

He's unconscious, with a nice knot on

his forehead, but stable. Three

officers are watching the room.

CONNERS

He wakes, they call.

(to the paramedic)

Hey Quincy, give it a rest, I'm fine.

PARAMEDIC

(beat)

Quincy was a coroner. You may have a

cracked rib. You should go to the

hospital.

CONNERS

I should do a lot of things.

TEDDY

You sure you're all right?

SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004            43.

CONNERS

I'm fine.

Conners and Teddy share a look, when...   Dekker enters.

DEKKER

Girl's name is Gina Lopez, twenty-

eight. Done some time for possession,

has two kids... Am I interrupting?

CONNERS

No.

TEDDY

Excuse me.

Teddy exits.

DEKKER

Gina claims she doesn't know anything

about a bank robbery.

CONNERS

Of course she doesn't.   Vincent!

Vincent trudges out of the kitchen.

CONNERS

Have'em put Ms. Lopez in interrogation

one and turn the A/C on full. Leave

her alone and cold. Let me know when

her nipples can cut glass.

VINCENT

Will do.

(To Dekker)

Detective... I didn't realize when we

first met who you were. I worked with

your father. It was only for a brief

time when I first got outta the

academy, but it was an honor.

CONNERS

(surprised)

Your father was Harry Dekker?

VINCENT

I wish it could've been for longer.

DEKKER

Thanks.

Vincent exits. Conners looks at Dekker in a new light.

Dekker starts away, until...

CONNERS

(new subject)

That was some fancy riding.    You have a

bike?

DEKKER

Used to, but I sold it.

(shows his scrape on his arm)

They're dangerous.

MARNIE ROLLINS, 20's, a CSI OFFICER, wears gloves, pokes her

head in the room.

MARNIE

Detectives. Ready for you.

80   THE BEDROOM--                                                    80

TWO LARGE SUITCASES rest OPEN on the bed.   Marnie prepares a

report.

CONNERS

Somebody going on a trip?

MARNIE

Looks like it, don't it?

CONNERS

Marnie, you're looking well.

MARNIE

Heard you were back, Conners... and

keep dreaming.

Marnie gives DEKKER an amorous glance, which he returns.

MARNIE

(to Dekker)

You, on the other hand... I gotta bike

myself. Maybe we can go for a ride

sometime? Or maybe I can just ride

you.

Conners looks at both of them.

CONNERS

Can we get back to work?

MARNIE

We got passports, sun tan lotion,

Bermuda shorts, thong bikini, hopefully

hers and this...

SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004       45.

She opens a LARGE DUFFEL BAG. Conners and Dekker look inside

the bag... It's FULL OF CASH! All denominations.

DEKKER

Must be a fifty large there easy.    His

cut?

MARNIE

You'd think, right?

DEKKER

It's not?

MARNIE

Don't put words in my mouth, but...

Two things jump out here. First, each

bank branch has their own money bands.

This is not American National's. After

a little checking, it belongs to

Pacific Savings of Seattle.

DEKKER

That sounds familiar.

MARNIE

It should. Four months ago, a half

million dollars was stolen in an armed

robbery there. Just a smash-n-grab

job. They caught the guys a day later,

recovering about $400,000. Those guys

have been in lock up since and their

trial's still pending. Which leads us

to point number two. Do you smell

that?

DEKKER

(smells the bills; grimaces)

What is it?

MARNIE

When evidence is taken in, any physical

contact might affect the ability to

lift prints, so, to mark it, we now

spray a scented solution directly on

the bill.

CONNERS

Is that new?

MARNIE

Wave of the future.   Gotta keep up with

the times, Conners.

DEKKER

So this money's not from our bank.

MARNIE

No. This is the money from the Pacific

Savings job and our evidence room.

(smiling; to Dekker)

Now... For a list of things you can

put in my mouth.

81   INT.   HALLWAY - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT - DAY                   81

Conners and Dekker confer with Teddy and Vincent.

CONNERS

Do you remember who headed up the

Pacific Savings case?

TEDDY

I think it was Callo.    Why?

CONNERS

No reason.     Just thinking out loud.

82   I/E    CONNERS'S CAR/ CITY STREETS - DAY                       82

Conners and Dekker head back to the police station.   It's

quiet between these two, until...

CONNERS

When you said it was your "family

business" I didn't think... I guess I

just didn't connect the dots.

DEKKER

Don't worry about it.

CONNERS

Your father was a hero.

DEKKER

Yes he was.

CONNERS

At first I thought maybe you were

related to the Captain.

DEKKER

No.   No relation.

CONNERS

The Captain, he just kind of

"discovered" you. Through the academy,

to excellent evaluation reports, while

(MORE)

CONNERS (cont'd)

on the beat, to the high test scores on

the detective's exam.

DEKKER

Something like that.

CONNERS

That's how he found me.

This surprises Dekker.

CONNERS

Maybe we're not as different as you

think.

83   INT.   INTERROGATION ROOM - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT         83

A small, cold room with a large mirror along the WEST WALL.

Gina sits at the table, shivering. Her breath visible, so

are her nipples through a WHITE, SEATTLE P.D. T-SHIRT.

Conners paces around her like a CIRCLING SHARK. Dekker's in

the corner, observing.

CONNERS

We found the money.

GINA

That money was Dwayne's...

CONNERS

That money came from our evidence room.

GINA

I told you. I don't know nothing about

a bank robbery. Whatever Damon was

into, I didn't know!

CONNERS

So, where were you going?

GINA

Vacation.

CONNERS

This isn't possession or solicitation,

Gina. This is felony-murder one. You

could get life.

GINA

Me!?   I didn't do nothing!

SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004          48.

CONNERS

(frustrated)

It's "I didn't do anything." "Didn't

do nothing" is a double negative,

infers the positive. The grammar in

this country sucks.

GINA

Then I didn't do ANY-thing!

Conners takes a seat next to Gina.    His EYES BURN through

her.

CONNERS

This isn't going away. You want to

walk out of here, you tell me

something... now.

GINA

I swear I don't know. Now I'm done

talking. I want a lawyer.

Dekker lowers his head.    Disappointed.

CONNERS

You sure that's what you want?

GINA

Yeah.

CONNERS

Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll

make. The first will be to the public

defender's office. The second to

children's services.

GINA

What?

Suddenly Gina's bravado disappears.    Suddenly a scared and

lonely girl.

CONNERS

It's simple... if you insist on a

lawyer, I take your kids.

GINA

No.

CONNERS

Not like you cared about them anyway.

You were ready to fly the coop with

"Shit-for-brains."

GINA

No.   You can't do that.

CONNERS

I can and I will.

GINA

Don't.

CONNERS

Tell me what I want to know!

Dekker stares incredulously at Conners.

GINA

(broken)

I don't know anything.     Please don't

take my kids. Please.

Conners stares into Gina's eyes. She's telling the truth.

Conners wraps his coat around Gina's shoulders.

CONNERS

Get her some coffee...     Something hot.

84   INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY             84

Dekker and Conners...

DEKKER

You believe her?

CONNERS

I think for the first time in that

girl's life she's telling the truth.

DEKKER

You had to know, once she asked for a

lawyer anything she told us would have

been inadmissable.

CONNERS

Who would've known? It would've been

my word against hers. Who do you think

the jury would've believed?

DEKKER

Justice by any means.    Even if you

cross the line.

CONNERS

The only line around here is the `blue

line', you cross that one, then you got

(MORE)

CONNERS (cont'd)

problems. Ask Callo, he knows what I'm

talking about.

Teddy enters, hands Conners a sheet of paper with: "EVIDENCE:

ITEM #4958378" scribbled on it.

TEDDY

Those serial numbers Marnie faxed me...

According to our computers, that money

should be downstairs.

85   INT.   EVIDENCE ROOM - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT                85

Occupies almost the entire basement of the police station.      A

STEEL CAGE protects the contents.

AT THE FRONT COUNTER--

Conners and Dekker wait. No one's working at present.

Dekker peers inside, anxiously looking for someone.

Dekker RINGS the service bell.

Finally... HARRY HUME, 50's, the cop on watch, limps to the

desk. Crotchety, with an overgrown belly, Frank's seen

better days. There's no love loss between Harry and Conners.

CONNERS

(cold)

Buzz us in.

HARRY

(colder)

You gotta sign first.

Conners and Dekker scribble their signatures down.

HARRY

I heard you were back. Kinda liked not

having you around, Conners.

Harry takes the clipboard, examines it until satisfied.   Then

reluctantly BUZZES them in.

CONNERS

Have another donut, Frankie.

Dekker and Conners proceed inside. They walk ALONG THE VAST

ROWS OF EVIDENCE, scan the shelves, checking the number.

CONNERS

That fat fuck is the sole guardian of

the city's biggest source of

contraband. Drugs. Weapons. Cash.

CONNERS (cont'd)

All totalled, about $50 million or so

just sitting here for the taking.

DEKKER

You'd have to have some major

firepower, not to mention an extra

large set of balls to try and knock off

a police station.

CONNERS

Not if you were a cop.    You could just

walk right in and...

CONNERS

...   Take whatever you want.   Shit.

85A   AT THE FRONT DESK--                                       85A

HARRY

Here is it. Line seventeen.

DEKKER

Bernie Callo.

HARRY

Like I said... No one takes anything

out of here, unless they sign for it.

CONNERS

So what...     He showed you a warrant?

What?

HARRY

He must've.

CONNERS

You don't remember?

HARRY

You know how many times someone signs

shit in and out? I see the same guys

all the time. I can't remember one

instance two weeks ago. But if his

signature's there, that means he signed

for it. Take it up with him!

86   INT.   CAPTAIN JENKINS'S OFFICE - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT      86

Jenkins listens as Conners and crew brief the situation.

CONNERS

The money from Richards's place traced

back to the Pacific Savings heist a few

months ago, a case Callo headed up.

TEDDY

Callo signed the money out of evidence

two weeks ago.

JENKINS

How much?

TEDDY

$433,000.

VINCENT

If it's Callo, it would explain how

they knew police protocol and how our

department operates.

TEDDY

Also explains why he was so pissed this

morning about being replaced by

Conners. He wanted to be the point so

everything went according to plan.

CONNERS

He doesn't need another reason to be

pissed at me.

JENKINS

What about motive?    Do we have one?

VINCENT

Pressure might've been getting to him.

He's been getting the cold shoulder

from cops since he testified about

Pearl Street Bridge.

JENKINS

No.   Don't buy that.

TEDDY

(beat)

He was also getting divorced.

This is news to everyone.

TEDDY

About a month ago, he told me he and

his wife might be splitting. Asked if

I knew a lawyer who wouldn't clean him

out. I didn't think it was this bad.

JENKINS

(conflicted)

Bernie Callo is a first rate cop.     A

boy scout. This doesn't make any

sense.

CONNERS

They never do, Captain.

JENKINS

Don't act like you're not enjoying

this, Conners. I know what you think

of him.

CONNERS

Doesn't matter what I think.      Facts

here speak for themselves.

DEKKER

No they don't. We haven't asked the

question... Why, if Callo's involved,

don't they ask for him at the bank?

(points to Conners)

They asked for you.

All eyes find Conners.   Then, Jenkins' PHONE RINGS...

JENKINS

(answering the phone)

Jenkins.

TIME CUT TO:

87   EXT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME - 4:18 PM - DAY                       87

The small home in a RURAL AREA is now COMPLETELY SURROUNDED

by COP CARS.

88   INT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME                                       88

A typical family-themed home. FAMILY PICTURES adorn the

walls. Everything in its right place. Except for... MRS.

CALLO, 40's, sits in the kitchen SOBBING. Police encircle

her.

In the center of the Living Room... BERNIE CALLO LIES DEAD,

a bullet wound right between the eyes.

SEVERAL UNIFORMED OFFICERS and CSI OFFICERS muddle through

every nook and cranny of the tiny home. Conners, Teddy and

Dekker are led around by a UNIFORMED OFFICER...

OFFICER AT CALLO HOUSE

Wife came home approximately forty-five

minutes ago. Found him here. None of

the neighbors heard anything. There's

no forced entry and no one saw anyone

fleeing the scene.

Vincent enters from the basement carrying a LARGE BOX.

VINCENT

Blueprints from the bank, schematics,

pictures... Also, about a dozen

internet articles on the Saudi Prince.

Found it behind the furnace.

Conners nods.

DEKKER

Well, that's it, right?

Suddenly... THE HOUSE TELEPHONE RINGS! Everyone peers

around. After the second ring, the ANSWERING MACHINE PICKS

UP...

CALLO (VO)

You've reached the Callo residence.   No

one can get to the phone right now.

Please leave a message.

Then...   After the TONE...

LORENZ (VO)

(from the machine)

Detective Conners... Are you there?

Conners and everyone turns, listens.

INTERCUT WITH:

89   INT.   DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    89

Lorenz stares ahead, transfixed by something.

LORENZ

Are you connecting the dots? Are you

putting it together? Is the pattern

emerging? They wouldn't punish you,

but I will.

Conners GRABS the phone...

LORENZ

Vengeance will be mine, Detective.

CONNERS

Then come and get me you piece of shit.

Lorenz smiles, hangs up.   He resumes staring at the wall in

front of him.

REVEAL: HUNDREDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS, NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS - ALL OF

CONNERS - DECORATE THE WALL!

90   EXT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME - DAY                                 90

Dekker leans back against the car, Conners approaches...

CONNERS

What they told Callo was the plan and what

the plan really was may be two different

things. Clearly this wasn't part of a plan

Callo would've agreed with.

DEKKER

You'd think a cop would be smarter.

CONNERS

As cops we come across every temptation

in the book. Money, drugs, power.

We'd all like to think we can resist

any urge, but... We're not saints.

DEKKER

So, Callo was involved and now they're

dragging you into it. Why?

CONNERS

Man said he wanted vengeance.

DEKKER

Piss anyone off lately?

CONNERS

Me?

Both can't help but smile.      Jenkins walks up.

JENKINS

I just got off the phone with Agent

Doyle. After the Charlotte break in,

the Prince withdrew all his possessions

from every safe deposit box in this

country.

SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004       56.

DEKKER

Let me get this straight, they didn't

touch the cash or the safe deposit

boxes. So, they... break into a bank,

blow it up, and steal nothing?

(to Conners)

Still make sense to you?

CONNERS

Nothing about today makes sense.

Dekker watches as BERNIE CALLO's body is loaded into the

Coroner's vehicle. Teddy assists MRS. CALLO into a police

car. Vincent carries the box of evidence from the home.

Dekker's mind works overtime, then...

DEKKER

"Return to the earth now if your mind

is troubled and your heart is

uncertain. For it is by returning to

the beginning that we can clearly see

the path."

Conners and Jenkins share a confused look.

CONNERS

(to Jenkins)

Don't look at me, he's your find.

JENKINS

Say that again, Detective?

DEKKER

We go back to where this all started.

We go to the bank.

91     EXT.   SEATTLE - 6:08 PM - NIGHT                              91

The sun SINKS below the horizon.

91 A   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - NIGHT                       91 A

As night settles, POLICE and EMT workers are still on site.

92     INT.   SECURITY ROOM - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                 92

Dekker and Conners watch as Dax operates.

DAX

The tapes confirm five bad guys, but

since the vault cam blew in the

explosion what they did in there was a

mystery.

SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004             57.

ON A COMPUTER MONITOR - The EIGHT SECURITY CAMERA ANGLES

appear.

ON THE MULTIPLE SCREENS... Just as in the opening, Lorenz

leads this crew through the bank. Immediately the group

splits up. IN THE VAULT... One of the Black Clads arrives

and radios in.

DAX

I've been through these tapes twenty

times already and nothing...

CONNERS

Shutup.

MONITOR #5... IN THE VAULT, Black Clad #2 fires the

explosives! The image goes to STATIC.

DEKKER

Wait, hold on a second.   Did you see it?

DAX

See what?

DEKKER

Go back a little.

CONNERS

What?

DEKKER

Notice the camera angles, they're all

fixed. They don't rotate or pan.

Dax rewinds, to before the explosion...

DEKKER

There. Stop. Play it. Look closely,

camera five, the vault cam, dominates

our attention because of the explosion.

But while that's happening, check out

Camera two, customer service.

ON SCREEN... Several BANK EMPLOYEES cower to the Black Clad.

Suddenly, another Black Clad DISAPPEARS UNDERNEATH THE

SECURITY CAMERA.

DAX

Where'd he go?

ON SCREEN... As the EXPLOSION GOES OFF, CAMERA #2 PANS AWAY

FROM THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SECTION, TOWARDS THE LOBBY.

CONNERS

He moved it. Changed the angle.    He

didn't want us to see something.

DEKKER

What's in that corner they didn't want

us to see?

Dax rewinds the tapes again, before the camera was moved and

FREEZES FRAME ON: a lone COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.

93   INT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                                 93

AT THE COMPUTER TERMINAL... A FORENSICS TECHNICIAN, 30's,

carefully dusts the computer keyboard for fingerprints.

Dekker and Conners look on.

DEKKER

Are you at all concerned that there's

some whacko out there looking to get

you?

CONNERS

If I worried about every threat made

against me, I'd never leave the house.

The Technician turns on a BLACK LIGHT and... FINGERPRINTS

APPEAR ALL OVER THE KEYBOARD!

Conners looks to Dekker, impressed.

CONNERS

(to the technician)

Those are priority one. If he's got a

record, I want an I.D. yesterday.

FORENSICS TECHNICIAN

I'm on my way.

CONNERS

Dax, can you hack in there and find out

what they were doing on this machine?

DAX

Hack into a nationwide bank's central

computer system? Love to.

DEKKER

What do we do in the meantime?

CONNERS

You like Italian?

94   INT.   ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                             94

The ITALIAN RESTAURANT HOST, 50's, jolly with a thick accent,

greets Conners and Dekker.

ITALIAN HOST

Detective, where you been? Much too

long. Sit, sit. I give you best table

in house. It'll just be the two?

CONNERS

No, four.    More are coming.

ITALIAN HOST

Wonderful, wonderful. Who's this young

man?

CONNERS

For all intents and purposes... he's

Big Brother.

ITALIAN HOST

(confused)

He's your brother?

CONNERS

No.

ITALIAN HOST

No matter, no matter...     I bring you

bottle of house wine!

DEKKER

We're still on duty.     No wine.

ITALIAN HOST

(insulted)

No wine?

CONNERS

A little wine.

ITALIAN HOST

That's better.

They get to the table, Conners looks at it.

CONNERS

Last time I was here, you said that

table in the corner was the "best in

the house."

ITALIAN HOST

It was. Anywhere you sit becomes best

table in house. Now relax, I bring you

food.

95   LATER, STILL AT THE RESTAURANT--                               95

A PIANO PLAYER recreates the sweet sounds of Italy.   PATRONS

sing along. Eating, drinking and being merry.

AT THE DETECTIVE'S TABLE--

Vincent and Teddy have joined Conners and Dekker. A MOUNTAIN

OF FOOD still remains. A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE have been

consumed, empty plates and basket rolls spread about. The

mood is happy, light. Not thinking about their day.

Conners tells an anecdote, something that Teddy and Vincent

have heard before, but don't care. Dekker watches the

Detectives, admires in their closeness.

CONNERS

Shane, what was that thing you said

back at the house about "returning to

the beginning path" or something?

DEKKER

It's a Buddhist story.

CONNERS

We're all ears.

DEKKER

One day the Buddha found his heart in

turmoil. So he retreats to the forest,

to the earth, to the base of a great

tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this

elephant comes up and tells Buddha he

doesn't like seeing him discouraged.

TEDDY

He can talk to an elephant?

DEKKER

He's the Buddha. He's attained the 6th

level of consciousness. He's capable

of communicating with plants, trees...

even rocks.

VINCENT

Rocks?

DEKKER

You asked.

SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004         61.

CONNERS

Continue.

DEKKER

The Buddha was troubled so he went back

to where he came from, the beginning,

to find the path, the answer. So when

you hit a dead end, go back to the

beginning to find your way. Or

something like that.

CONNERS

We have a genuine philosopher in our

midst.

VINCENT

You're a Buddhist?

DEKKER

No. Just something I picked up along

the way.

TEDDY

But you're religious?

DEKKER

Not particularly.

Conners stares curiously at his new partner.   Then excuses

himself to go to the men's room.

DEKKER

You're all pretty tight.

TEDDY

We've been through a lot together.

DEKKER

I guess I just thought... I don't

know. With all the trouble he's been

in lately, coming back from suspension,

everyone would treat him differently.

VINCENT

You can't believe what you read or see

on TV. If anything, our tie to Conners

is stronger. He's one of the best.

Even when things got pretty wild today

and everyone else panicked, he was in

control. That doesn't just happen.

He's just that good.

TEDDY

Excuse me.

Teddy heads for the ladies room.

VINCENT

What was the Buddha looking for?

DEKKER

The divine in himself.

Art's confused.    Dekker's cellphone rings.

DEKKER

How long does it usually take to for

fingerprints to be ID'd?

VINCENT

Hours, maybe days.    We could be waiting

a while.

DEKKER

(answering)

Dekker./ Okay.

(Snapping the phone shut...)

They got a match.

96   INT.   BY THE RESTROOMS - ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT             96

LONG CURTAINS divide the rooms.

Conners exits the men's room, Teddy appears and before a word

can be spoken... SHE KISSES HIM HARD, PASSIONATELY ON THE

LIPS. Conners gives in for just a moment. He breaks the

embrace.

CONNERS

What are you doing?

TEDDY

I realized something today. Being

around you, all that's happened...       I

can't... I think I made a mistake.

CONNERS

It's too late. You've made your

choice. Live with it.

This jab hurts Teddy and Conners knows it.     Dekker parts the

curtains...

DEKKER

We got a match.

Teddy separates from Conners.

CONNERS

You got a name?

DEKKER

Chris Lei.

CONNERS

(a knowing disgust)

Sonofabitch.

97   INT.   CONNERS'S CAR - NIGHT                                 97

Conners drives, Dekker reads Chris Lei's file. On top of the

file is a MUGSHOT PHOTO of, "Lei, CHRIS". He's an early-30's

Chinese-American with a "weasel factor" off the charts.

CONNERS

Prick used to work for some big-time

software company until they caught him

dipping into the company's slush fund.

They didn't want the publicity so they

didn't press charges. Couple years

later, he was busted for looting the

pension plans of retired cops. For a

genius... he's a fucking moron.

DEKKER

This was your case. You and York. You

made the bust. Why didn't it stick?

CONNERS

His lawyer put us on trial. Said we

were crooked, abusive, that we planted

evidence... We were in the midst of

the Pearl Street Bridge fallout. Jury

bought it. They let him walk and we

were the scapegoats.

DEKKER

Was it true?

CONNERS

The guy was guilty. He was scum. That

was the truth.

(beat)

There's something they don't teach you.

The system breaks down. You have to

compensate to get results.

DEKKER

That gives you the right to break the

rules?

SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004         64.

CONNERS

Break, no.     Bend... if it means

justice...     Absolutely.

DEKKER

Another thing they don't teach you.

Thought so.

From a nearby medicine cabinet, Dekker rummages around.

DEKKER

I was skiing about three years ago.

Aspen. Beautiful country. Ever been?

Never mind. I hit a mogul, landed on a

sheet of ice and slammed into a tree.

Broke myself up pretty bad. Kinda like

you did today. I was in a hospital bed

for three months. Had it not been

for... Here it is.

(he finds)

Morphine. Without this stuff, I

wouldn't have made it.

Dekker fills a syringe with the entire bottle.

DEKKER

Now this IV drip administers a small

dosage every minute. Makes you feel

relaxed and calm. No pain. But...

Dekker sticks the syringe needle tip into the IV bag.

DEKKER

If I were to inject this whole thing...

That would be all she wrote for Damon.

RICHARDS

You don't have the balls.

Dekker PRESSES down on the syringe, just a little, but enough

to go into the bag. Richards can't believe it.

DEKKER

This equipment malfunctions all the

time. Overdoses are quite common.

Besides, I don't think the DA's going

to launch a full-scale investigation

over a scum like you.

Richards attempts to signal for a nurse, but Dekker pulls the

call button away.

DEKKER

You don't have to tell us a damn thing.

Plead the fifth... roll the dice.

Dekker SQUEEZES in some more, until...   Richards gives in,

signals that he'll talk.

CONNERS

You fuckin' hypocrite. You give me

shit for my interrogating skills...

least I don't threaten them with a

lethal overdose.

Dekker holds the empty vile up, hands it to Conners.

DEKKER

There's never been a single case in

recorded medical history of someone

overdosing on 200 milliliters of

saline.

Conners checks the label, smiles.

Lorenz's true identity is Scott Curtis.

He's wanted in connection to three

other bank robberies, extorsion and

kidnapping.

KNIGHT, 50's.

JENKINS

He's also the brother of John Curtis,

the perp Conners shot at Pearl Street

Bridge.

(Moving on)

Richards testifies that he was hired by

Curtis to pull the bank job with a

dirty cop on the inside, Bernie Callo.

Curtis hoped that Conners would take

the fall for American National turning

ugly, disgracing him even further. We

also have the names of two more

Harrington. Everyone was set to meet

Because he died on the job, he's a

CONNERS

So why become a cop?

DEKKER

Finish what he started. Every day he

went out, trying to do some good. Help

the people who couldn't help

themselves, just give'em a chance is

what he always said. Didn't always

work out right, but he tried. You

tried to help save that girl on the

still would've died. She had a chance

because you were there. That's all we

can do.

Vincent swings in from one entrance, Teddy the other.   She

takes a cautious step out, when...

BAM! A BULLET ZINGS PAST TEDDY - HITS THE WALL BESIDE HER

HEAD!

HARRINGTON, from the corner, takes aim again!

VINCENT drops to the floor, aims through the dining room

table legs and FIRES!

THE BULLET TEARS INTO HARRINGTON'S SHIN!   He SCREAMS IN PAIN,

DROPS TO THE FLOOR!

Teddy moves in on Harrington.

TEDDY

Drop the gun!

Harrington holds his gun UP AND OUT towards Teddy.   Is he

aiming or surrendering?

TEDDY

Drop it now. Last warning.

But he doesn't.

Conners and Dekker meet by the top of the stairs.

CONNERS

Teddy!?     What's happening?

Vincent appears at the bottom of the stairs.

VINCENT

We got one down. He's dead.

138    UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/ STAIRCASE--                                    138

Dekker and Conners share a look, disappointed.      But then

something catches Conners's eye.

BEHIND DEKKER...     a door OPENS...   LAMAR GALT AIMS HIS

WEAPON!

CONNERS

GUN!

GALT FIRES!

Conners PUSHES DEKKER OUT OF THE WAY, just in the nick of

time!

DEKKER TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS!    Vincent breaks his fall.

GALT FIRES AT CONNERS, until he's out of bullets.      He ducks

back behind a door.

Conners FIRES!   But did he hit anyone?     Conners pursues...

138A   AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS--                                   138A

Dekker grabs his head, in pain, but okay.

Conners creeps inside the partially open doorway. It's

quiet, until... LAMAR GALT lunges, tackles Conners! His gun

flies from his hands.

Dekker and Teddy look to the house, when...

KA-BOOM!   A SECOND EXPLOSION!   THE ENTIRE HOUSE BLOWS!

DEKKER, VINCENT AND THE TWO OFFICERS DUCK FOR COVER!    TEDDY

STARES AT THE HOUSE, HORRIFIED!

DEKKER gets up, watches the FLAMES CONSUME THE HOUSE!

TEDDY runs towards the house, when...   DEKKER stops her.

TEDDY

No!   No, we have to go save him!

We can't.

TEDDY

Detective Galloway, could you give us a

We just wanted a statement.

Shame on you.

KAREN CROSS

This is more than just news for us.

American National's CFO sits on the

vested interest in what's going on.

DEKKER

TEDDY

Conners was right. We should've never

gone in. How many more mistakes can we

make in one day? He was eliminating

his accomplices. We thought he was

going to show up? We didn't even think

he could do this... How dumb are we?

DAX

Detective?

SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004   81.

DAX

I know what they were doing inside the

bank.

DEKKER AND DAX--

Dax flips through the huge document.

DAX

These are today's transaction records

from the bank. An average day produces

about 400 pages, give or take. Today,

there were over 3,000 pages.

DEKKER

Meaning?

DAX

We've just witnessed the largest heist

in history. Somewhere in the

neighborhood of a billion dollars.

DEKKER

Come again?

DAX

It's a computer virus. "The Computer

Virus." It randomly withdraws money

from all the accounts and deposits it

into the bad guys' account. If you

check the transactions, no two

withdrawal amounts are the same and

none of'em are over $100. Most

security systems work on the size of

the money, not number of transactions.

Wire out one million from a handful of

accounts and red flags go up. Wire out

a less than a hundred from ten million

accounts, no flags.

DEKKER

Where's the money now?

DAX

I tried following one of the

transactions. It took me an hour and

when I finally had it... It went away.

DEKKER

How is that possible?

DAX

The virus created a host of phantom

accounts where the money goes

(MORE)

SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004             82.

DAX (cont'd)

temporarily, then transfers to another

account, then to another. It's never

in one place long enough to get an

accurate fix.

DEKKER

It's still moving the money around?

DAX

Yeah. Any deposit or withdrawal from

any bank doesn't usually go into affect

until the next business day. So it's

going to keep jumping around until it

clears at 9 AM tomorrow.

DEKKER

(realizes)

Or 6 AM Pacific time. Sunrise. So why

break in? If they're just wiring

money? Couldn't they do that from

anywhere?

DAX

That's the regional manager's computer

terminal. There's no outside/remote

access to it. There you have unlimited

entry to the bank's mainframe. No

passwords to work around, no "hacking"

in. It's all nice and clean.

DEKKER

A billion dollars is missing and we're

only discovering this now?

DAX

Ironically, when the power went out, it

helped hide the virus and bought it

time to work.

DEKKER

So they weren't trying to make   it look

like they were robbing a bank,   to rip

off a Saudi Prince? They were    making

it look like they ripped off a   Saudi

Prince to rob a bank.

No. My wish is to catch you. You're a

it. Callo was insignificant and

Conners crossed me. In years to come

you'll thank me for getting rid of him

They're not the same signature, Harry.

They're not even close.

TEDDY

We used to spend all day   Sunday just

reading in bed. I would    read the paper

and he would read one of   his billion

books. I didn't deserve    him. I knew

that. But I still loved    him.

Teddy stares out the window...

POV OF TEDDY - Jenkins speaks to Karen Cross.

TEDDY

He's the only man I ever loved.

(beat)

Did we all get shot today?

They can't help but laugh.

DEKKER

They said in the city I'd be busy.

Every day like this?

TEDDY

Pretty much.

DEKKER

Great.    I wonder what's next?

TEDDY

For me...    a long vacation.

Teddy excuses herself to the bathroom.      Dekker goes to pay

the check.

AT THE CASHIER...   Dekker reaches for his wallet, opens it.

DEKKER

How much?

PRETTY WAITRESS

Do you think I'm going to charge you

after all that? Go on.

DEKKER

Thanks.

Dekker notices the tip jar by the register. He removes a TEN

DOLLAR BILL, about to stuff it in the jar...

That's when THE SMELL hits him. A strange, but familiar ODOR

comes from Dekker's wallet or more accurately... The TEN

DOLLAR BILL! But what is it?

MARNIE

Do you smell that?

DEKKER

(smells the bills; grimaces)

What is it?

MARNIE

When evidence is taken in, any physical

mark might effect the ability to lift

prints, so, to mark it, we spray it

with a scented solution.

181    INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                     181

PAPERS and BOOKS litter the floor.

Dekker trashes the place, looking for a clue of any kind. He

rifles through the bookshelves, cabinets. All to no avail.

That's when he finds... a medium-sized paperback, dog-eared

and worn. The title of the book... "CHAOS" by James Gleick.

Dekker flips through the book. Pages are marked, high-

lighted. Key words we find include, "EDWARD LORENZ, CHAOS

THEORY, BIRTH OF A NEW SCIENCE."

TIME CUT TO:

181A   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - LATER                    181A

Dekker holds the "Chaos" book in his hand, paces...

DEKKER

(into phone)

You tried them all?/ Nothing for

Conners or Lorenz?/ I don't know.        No,

maybe he's not on a flight.

Dekker then notices - the book.     The author's name.

DEKKER

Try again.     But try Gleick.   James

Gleick.

183    INT.   WESTERN AIRLINES TERMINAL - DAY                             183

Dekker scans the line up of people.      Nothing.

BY THE MEN'S ROOM--

A MAN, 40's, in DISGUISE (Brown Wig), SPIES Dekker.          He picks

up a CELLPHONE, DIALS... DEKKER'S CELLPHONE RINGS.           He

quickly picks it up.

CONNERS (VO)

There's a passage in the Surangama

Sutra which, roughly translated means:

"Things are not what they appear to be:

nor are they otherwise."

SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004                99.

DEKKER

Conners?

CONNERS (VO)

Think about that a minute... Doesn't

that blow your mind?

(beat)

What gave me away?

DEKKER

Ten bucks.

CONNERS (VO)

At the diner. That's right...       Well,

to err is human.

CONNERS (VO)

Was it Harry that gave him up?

DEKKER

Harry and the phone call. He called

me, said Callo was insignificant.

Threw up a red flag.

CONNERS (VO)

That wasn't him. That was my mistake.

I called you.

CONNERS (VO)

York always thought "the plan" was

flawless. He was cocky. I told him

you have to leave room for error. You

can't always predict how it's all going

to play out. A random camera catches

an image of Richards, the scent on the

money... you. You were the biggest

wrench of the day. The Chaos Theory...

When you got that... I was impressed.

DEKKER

All day long, we were trying to find

out who the inside source was... it

was you.

CONNERS

The more information you gather, from

as many sources as possible, no matter

how unpleasant the methods are, the

better. And while I'd like to take

sole credit it was a team effort.

DEKKER

(beat)

Teddy's pretty devastated about your

death.

CONNERS (VO)

She'll get over it.

DEKKER

So the corpse in the morgue with your

name on its toe...?

CONNERS (VO)

Scott Curtis won't be bothering anyone

again.

DEKKER

You're a serial killer.

CONNERS (VO)

Who got killed? Curtis? Harrington,

Galt, Lei. They're all hoods. The

world's safer with them gone. The kid

at the bank... that was unfortunate.

But... you live with your decisions.

You choose to take this road... there

is no half way. It's all or nothing.

That's why others fail. They don't

make the commitment. I won't make that

same mistake.

DEKKER

You said they were all hoods...     what

about, Callo?

CONNERS

Callo deserved his fate.      It's his fault.

DEKKER

This is Callo's fault?

CONNERS

If it weren't for him, York and I

would've never done this. One random

act, causes another, causes another,

and in the end... the pattern emerges.

That's the Chaos Theory.

(beat)

It's after six. The money's cleared.

I'm a wealthy man. Lei, for all his

evil, was one smart sonofabitch. The

Feds will be tracing false leads for

weeks.

DEKKER

Lei... you tanked his trial on purpose.

CONNERS

They should've suspended me after I

testified. What did they expect?

DEKKER

And because the "bitch that made her

career off you" worked for Channel Two,

that's why American National was the

target.

CONNERS

Everybody who screwed us, got screwed.

Everything in its right place.

DEKKER

Why not kill me? You had plenty of

opportunities.

CONNERS

This wasn't about killing, Shane. This

was about standing up for what matters.

Besides... you kinda grew on me.

DEKKER

You're not going to get away.

CONNERS (VO)

I already have. I'm not even here now.

This is a very valuable lesson for you

to learn, and it's good to have learned

it early.

DEKKER

What's that?

CONNERS (VO)

You don't always win.

DEKKER

All your years of service for not.

You're a hypocrite.

CONNERS (VO)

I'm an opportunist. I would've gladly

died in the line of duty, but they took

that away. If they had been as

faithful to me, as I to them none of
