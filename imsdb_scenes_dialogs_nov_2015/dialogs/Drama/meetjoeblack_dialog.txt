VOICE (V.O.)

... Yes.

VOICE (V.O.)

Yes...

VOICE (V.O.)

Yes.

PAINTER

The big tent, Miss Allison --

ALLISON

Paint is rust and moss green.

Medieval colors -- Daddy's like

an old knight.

FLORIST

The head table --?

ALLISON

What about it?

FLORIST

The flowers, ma'am--?

ALLISON

Freesia, freesia, everywhere.  Daddy

loves freesia -- and you, over there,

lights.  Not too bright.  I'm looking

for a saffron glow -- sort of tea-

dance twenties.

PARRISH

What do you think of all this, May?

MAY

It's going to be beautiful.  And

Miss Allison says the President may

come.

PARRISH

Oh, the President's got better

things to do than come to my

birthday party.

MAY

(smiling)

What?

ALLISON

Daddy!

PARRISH

Hi, Allison --

ALLISON

Have you got a minute?

PARRISH

Not much more.  Big day in the big

city.  What's on your mind?

ALLISON

Fireworks.  Update -- we're con-

structing the number '65' on the

barge, archers from the State

College at New Paltz will shoot

flaming arrows at it, when it

catches fire it will give us the

effect of a Viking funeral with none

of the morbidity... The Hudson River

Authority says, for you, they'll

make a special dispensation - of

course there'll be an overtime bill

for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...

PARRISH

Allison, I trust you.  This is your

thing.

ALLISON

But it's your birthday.

SUSAN

Good morning, Dad.

PARRISH

Hi, honey.

ALLISON

(to Susan)

I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.

SUSAN

(smiling)

Drew called from the AStar, they're

still two minutes away.

PARRISH

Drew's aboard?

SUSAN

He wanted to ride back down with

you. Now sit and relax, get some-

thing in that flat tummy of yours --

SUSAN (cont'd)

(to Allison)

You coming?

ALLISON

You've got patients waiting, I've

got three hysterical chefs, one

loves truffles, the other hates

truffles, the third one doesn't know

what truffles are.  I'd better drive

down.

PARRISH

(unconsciously)

I hate parties --

ALLISON

Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're

going to love it.

PARRISH

Isn't it enough to be on this earth

sixty-five years without having to

be reminded of it.

ALLISON

No.

SUSAN

Will you relax?  I know it is a big

deal day --

PARRISH

How did you know?

SUSAN

Drew told me.

PARRISH

Does Drew tell you everything?

SUSAN

I hope so.

PARRISH

You like him, don't you?

SUSAN

Yeah.  I guess so.

PARRISH

I don't like to interfere.

SUSAN

...Then don't.

SUSAN (cont'd)

-- Here comes our boy now --

Shall we?

QUINCE

...This shit's not bad.

AMBROSE

-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr.

Quince, a possibility for dessert.

QUINCE

(pointing to another

bottle)

And that?

AMBROSE

Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it

for the appetizer.

QUINCE

What do you do that for?

AMBROSE

Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.

QUINCE

9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come

from, the sun's over the yardarm,

m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.

ALLISON

Quince!  Everybody's waiting!

DREW

(to Susan)

Hello, Beautiful.

SUSAN

Hi.

PARRISH

Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for

coming out.

DREW

Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to

line up a few ducks before kickoff.

Any thoughts?  Last minute refine-

ments or variations?

PARRISH

'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did

hear a voice last night.

DREW

A voice?

PARRISH

In my sleep.

DREW

What'd it say?

PARRISH

'Yes'.

DREW

'Yes' to the deal?

PARRISH

Maybe, who knows?  You know how

voices are.  Let's go.

QUINCE

Hi, Bill --

PARRISH

Good morning, Quince.

QUINCE

How're you doing--?

PARRISH

I'm doing great.  You ready?

QUINCE

I am, this is it.  B Day.

PARRISH

How's that, Quince?

QUINCE

Bontecou Day.  Going to close

with Big John -- Look at you, Bill,

all cool as a cat and over at

Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting

in his pants.

ALLISON

(to Quince)

Honey, please.

QUINCE

Okay.  All aboard - New York, New

York!

ALLISON

Remember everybody, tonight, dinner

in the city at Daddy's.  You too,

Drew.  We've still got some loose

ends --

PARRISH

Not my birthday again?

SUSAN

You're only six-five once.

PARRISH

Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's

get this day started.

SUSAN

I thought you were in a meeting--?

PARRISH

I am.  With you.

PARRISH (cont'd)

Do you love Drew?

SUSAN

...There's a start for a meeting.

PARRISH

I know it's none of my business --

SUSAN

No, it's none of your business.

PARRISH

Do you love Drew?

SUSAN

You mean like you loved Mom?

PARRISH

Forget about me and Mom -- are you

going to marry him?

SUSAN

Probably.

PARRISH

(smiles)

Don't get carried away.

SUSAN

Uh oh --

PARRISH

Susan, you're a hell of a woman.

You've got a great career, you're

beautiful --

SUSAN

And I'm your daughter and no man

will ever be good enough for me.

PARRISH

Well, I wasn't going to say that --

SUSAN

What were you going to say?

PARRISH

Listen, I'm crazy about the guy --

He's smart, he's aggressive, he

could carry Parrish Communications

into the 21st century and me along

with it.

SUSAN

So what's wrong with that?

PARRISH

That's for me.  I'm talking about

you.  It's not so much what you say

about Drew, it's what you don't say.

SUSAN

You're not listening --

PARRISH

Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of

excitement, not a whisper of a

thrill, this relationship has all

the passion of a pair of titmice.

SUSAN

Don't get dirty, Dad --

PARRISH

Well, it worries me.  I want you

to get swept away.  I want you to

levitate.  I want you to sing with

rapture and dance like a dervish.

SUSAN

That's all?

PARRISH

Be deliriously happy.  Or at least

leave yourself open to be.

SUSAN

'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going

to do my upmost --

PARRISH

I know it's a cornball thing but

love is passion, obsession, someone

you can't live without.  If you

don't start with that, what are you

going to end up with?  I say fall

head over heels.  Find someone you

can love like crazy and who'll love

you the same way back.  And how do

you find him?  Forget your head and

listen to your heart.  I'm not

hearing any heart.

(a moment)

Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll

come back.  Because, the truth is

there is no sense living your life

without this.  To make the journey

and not fall deeply in love -- well,

you haven't lived a life at all.

You have to try.  Because if you

haven't tried, you haven't lived.

SUSAN

Bravo.

PARRISH

Aw, you're tough.

SUSAN

I'm sorry.  But give it to me again.

The short version.

PARRISH

Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning

could strike.

PARRISH (cont'd)

Forgive the lecture --

SUSAN

I won't.  And when I tell Drew about

it, he won't either.

PARRISH

You won't tell him, and even if you

did, he'd clock it and punch it into

his laptop in order to pull out some

key phrases when he gives the

Commencement Speech at Wharton.

SUSAN

You're terrible.

PARRISH

I know.  But I'm the only father

you've got.

SUSAN

Thank God.

PARRISH

He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.

QUINCE

Hey, this is it, the hour approach-

es, I'm getting all excited.  So

what do you think, is it --

(indicates Drew and

Parrish)

-- just the 'Executive Committee' or

could you guys use me?

DREW

Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer,

but it's all set for just me and Bill.

More people might --

QUINCE

I know.  Gum up the works.

VOICE (V.O.)

'...I know, it's none of my

business.'

PARRISH

What?

DREW

I was saying to Quince we won't

need --

PARRISH

Did you just hear something?

DREW

Why yes, Bill, I was saying to

Quince --

PARRISH

No no, not you.

SUSAN

Daddy, what's the matter?

PARRISH

Nothing.  I'm sorry.

VOICE (V.O.)

'...I want you to levitate.  I want

you to sing with rapture and dance

like a dervish.'

SUSAN

What is it, Daddy --?

PARRISH

Nothing.

PARRISH (cont'd)

Just talking to myself again.  You

know me --

PARRISH

Well, here we are --

SUSAN

(to Parrish)

Are you okay?

PARRISH

A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears

pricked.  I'm ready for action.

SUSAN

Well, go get 'em, Pops.

PARRISH

Yer damn right.

DREW

...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo

opportunity, you and Big John, it'll

lead network news.  Okay so far?

PARRISH

Sounds good.

DREW

It's going to be great --

PARRISH

Do you think I need a haircut?

DREW

Bill, after this deal, you'll be

able to afford one.

DREW

Their PR guy asked me, what did I

think Parrish Communications stood

for, that's principle and ethics-

wise?  I came up with something, but

then it occurred to me, why don't I

ask Bill?  What do you think?

PARRISH

Our first annual report, must be

thirty-five years ago now, I owned

two stations, I wrote down a state-

ment of purpose, that one day you

would wake up to a Parrish radio

station, read a Parrish paper at

breakfast, catch our news on tele-

vision during the day, and go to bed

with one of our books or magazines

and you would always be told the

truth and in the bargain, have a

good time.

DREW

That's great!  Wait 'til I show it

to Bontecou.

BONTECOU

Bill, thanks for coming over...

(to Drew)

And how're you doing today, Drew?

(to Parrish)

You've got a firecracker here, the

kid's really set the table.

PARRISH

Good, good.  Glad to hear it.

BONTECOU

We've met before, y'know, that White

House function, the President had

you on his right and you know where

I was?

PARRISH

I'm sorry, I don't recall --

BONTECOU

Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I

want to come in from the outfield,

bat cleanup like you have, learn the

plush ropes --

PARRISH

I thought you were buying my company.

BONTECOU

Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy

Parrish Communications.  I could pay

for it, of course, but it would

always have your imprint.

PARRISH

Well, that's very nice to hear.

YOUNG MAN

...Honey, you've got to go on...

there's a time to sow and a time to

reap, you sow now and forget about

him... yeah, I liked him, I don't

like him anymore... because you're

my honey and anybody messes with you

messes with me -- I'm on a plane in

a minute... as soon as I get my

phone in, you're my first call,

that's a promise... where you going

now?... good, hit the books, get that

degree, one day we'll hang out a

shingle together... you bet, honey...

later.

YOUNG MAN

Good morning, I was talking kind of

loud there, sorry.

SUSAN

Not at all.  It was fascinating.

YOUNG MAN

Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating'

about it?

SUSAN

You and 'Honey'?

YOUNG MAN

My kid sister.  She just broke up

with her boyfriend and she's

thinking about dropping out of

law school.

SUSAN

I'm sorry --

YOUNG MAN

Nothing to be sorry about.  That's

the way with men and women, isn't

it?

SUSAN

What's the way?

YOUNG MAN

Nothing lasts.

SUSAN

I agree --

YOUNG MAN

Why?

SUSAN

I was just being agreeable, now I've

got to explain why?

YOUNG MAN

I'm not trying to sharpshoot you,

but that 'nothing lasts' stuff,

that's what was the trouble with

Honey's guy.  He was fooling around

and Honey caught him at it.  One

girlfriend wasn't enough for him.

SUSAN

So you're a one-girl guy?

YOUNG MAN

Damn right.  Looking for her right

now.  Who knows?  You might be her.

YOUNG MAN (cont'd)

Well, don't laugh.  I just arrived

in town, got a new job -- I'm trying

to get into this apartment.  You a

doctor?

SUSAN

How'd you know?

YOUNG MAN

Everybody's a doctor around here.

This apartment house is all green

pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm

waiting for to vacate is a doctor.

What kind of doctor?

SUSAN

Me?  Internal medicine.

YOUNG MAN

So if I needed a doctor, you could

be it?

SUSAN

I could be her.

YOUNG MAN

'Her'.

SUSAN

Yes, I could.

(a moment)

I have an office in the hospital.

YOUNG MAN

-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive

in this big bad city and I not only

find a doctor, a beautiful woman as

well.

YOUNG MAN (cont'd)

I'm sorry, you mind my saying that?

SUSAN

Not at all.

YOUNG MAN

How 'bout another cup of coffee?

SUSAN

I've got patients coming in --

YOUNG MAN

And I want to get into my apartment

and go to work.  Please, what do you

say, another cup of coffee?

YOUNG MAN (cont'd)

I see you use lots of sugar and

cream.  Me, too...

DREW

I'm all excited --

PARRISH

Me, too.

DREW

I thought it was great, I thought

you and Big John would be like a

couple of bulls in a china shop --

(faltering)

Instead it was --

PARRISH

Like a marriage made in heaven?

DREW

You have a way with words.

JENIFER

Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

PARRISH

Hi, Jennifer.

DREW

So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll

recommend, we close and it's a deal,

right?

PARRISH

As close as a deal could be.

DREW

(bursting)

Olympic.

DREW (cont'd)

This is our lucky day.

VOICE (V.O.)

Yes.

VOICE (V.O., cont'd)

...Yes.

PARRISH

'Yes' what?

VOICE

'Yes' is the answer to your

question.

PARRISH

I didn't ask any question.

VOICE

I believe you did.

PARRISH

Who are you?

PARRISH (cont'd)

Goddammit, what is going on?!

VOICE

I think you know --

PARRISH

I don't!

VOICE

Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried,

you haven't lived'.

PARRISH

What are you talking about?

VOICE

What you were talking about.

PARRISH

What is this?  Who is this fucking

guy?

PARRISH (cont'd)

Tell me who you are!

VOICE

Are you giving me orders?

PARRISH

I'm sorry, I --

VOICE

No, you're not.  You're trying to

'handle' the situation but this is

the one situation you knew you never

could handle.

PARRISH

Where are you?  Are you there?

VOICE

It's enough now.

PARRISH

Please.  Talk to me --

VOICE

There's going to be plenty of time

for that.

PARRISH

What do you mean?!

VOICE

I think you know --

PARRISH

Know what?

(a moment)

Know what, goddammit!

PARRISH

(carefully)

Come in.

JENIFER

I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish.

Are you all right?

PARRISH

Sure.

JENIFER

Lunch is 'in' today, have you given

it any thought --_

PARRISH

(interrupting)

No.  Nothing.

JENIFER

Nothing?

JENIFER (cont'd)

Why don't I think of something?

YOUNG MAN

...It's kind of a pro bono job.

SUSAN

'Pro bono'.  That means doing good

-- Going to be doing good all your

life?

YOUNG MAN

I know what you're saying.  Doesn't

pay very well.  Depends on the woman

I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger

house, a better car, lotsa kids,

college doesn't come cheap --

SUSAN

You'd give up what you want for the

woman you marry?

YOUNG MAN

I would.

YOUNG MAN (cont'd)

If I married you, I'd want to give

you what you wanted, I know it's

old fashioned and all that, but

what's wrong with taking care of a

woman?  She takes care of you.

SUSAN

You'll have a hard time finding a

woman like that these days --

YOUNG MAN

You never know.  Lightning could

strike.

SUSAN

I've got to go --

YOUNG MAN

Did I say something wrong?

SUSAN

No, it was so right it scares me.

YOUNG MAN

I've been thinking... I don't want

you to be my doctor.  Because I

don't want you to examine me.

SUSAN

Why?

YOUNG MAN

Because I like you so much.

(a moment)

You have coffee here every morning,

don't you?  If I came by, could you

give me the name of a doctor?

SUSAN

Sure, I'll give you the name of a

doctor.

(a moment)

...And I don't want to examine you.

YOUNG MAN

Why not?

SUSAN

Because I like you so much.  Now

I've got to go.

CUT TO:

ALLISON

...Music, I know how you love music,

Daddy, and I want to have music that

pleases you -- and of course doesn't

put a thousand other people to sleep

-- I've agonized over this and

finally settled on Sidney Brown,

twenty-four men, very eclectic, plus

I'm feathering in a Latin sextet on

their breaks - Tito Puente, Trini

Lopez-zy, I forget their names --

ALLISON (cont'd)

You haven't heard a word, have you?

I keep talking and all you do is nod

like Mr. Himmelfass in The

Nutcracker.

ALLISON (cont'd)

You don't care, do you?

PARRISH

What, honey?

ALLISON

I lay awake nights in a cold sweat,

I want this party to be like some-

thing Mom would have made for you,

I want it to be perfect --

PARRISH

(attentive now)

I know you do, darling.

ALLISON

And you could care less --

PARRISH

Oh, you couldn't be more wrong,

sweetheart.  I can' tell you how

much I appreciate it and how I'm

looking forward to it.

ALLISON

Good.  Songs.  What songs should

Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we

can forget about -- what songs do

you think he should play?

PARRISH

Tell it to me again.

VOICE (V.O.)

...Yes.

VOICE (V.O., cont'd)

(to Parrish)

Did you miss me?

ALLISON

(to Parrish)

Never mind.  Leave it to me.

LUISA

Mr. Parrish, dinner is served.

ALLISON

(to Quince and Drew,

across the room)

Chow-time, you guys.

VOICE (V.O.)

What are you looking so provoked

about?  'Did you miss me?'  It's

a normal question.  I missed you.

But what do I get back?  'Not an

ounce of excitement, not a whisper

of a thrill --'

VOICE (V.O., cont'd)

'-- This relationship has all the

passion of a pair of titmice'.

VOICE (V.O., cont'd)

I'm waiting outside.

ALLISON

(to Drew)

Did you speak to the Governor?

DREW

He's coming.

ALLISON

His wife?

DREW

Unfortunately.  I sat between them

at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was

better than Seconal.

VOICE (V.O.)

I'm waiting outside.  Won't someone

come to the door?

PARRISH

Is somebody waiting outside, Luisa?

LUISA

I didn't hear a ring, sir.

PARRISH

Please have a look --

ALLISON

(to Quince)

What about the Mayor?

QUINCE

He said he would be there with bells

on.

DREW

Good, maybe they'll drown him out.

ALLISON

Please don't be negative, Drew, we

have an acceptance list that would

do The White House proud -- The

Secretary-General of the UN, the

Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators,

I don't know how many Congressmen,

and at least twelve of the Fortune

'500'.

QUINCE

No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a

Masters champion?  Someone I could

talk to.

(a moment)

Or would talk to me.

LUISA

You're right, Mr. Parrish.  There

was a gentleman at the door.  He's

waiting for you in the foyer.

PARRISH

(after a moment)

Show him into the library, tell him

I'll be right there.

ALLISON

I've arranged for favors -- silver

charm bracelets for the women,

platinum keychains for the men --

all engraved 'W.P.' -- but now I'm

thinking of scrubbing them, they

seem so ordinary.

ALLISON (cont'd)

Are they ordinary?  Do they seem

that way to you, Daddy?

PARRISH

Uh -- I don't know.  No - uh - I

don't...

DREW

(to Allison)

You're overthinking it --

QUINCE

I don't think they're ordinary.  I

love keychains.

PARRISH

Hello?

PARRISH (cont'd)

Anyone here?

PARRISH (cont'd)

I said is anyone here?!

VOICE (V.O.)

Quiet down.

PARRISH

(quietly)

Where are you?

VOICE (V.O.)

I'm here.

PARRISH

What is this, a joke, right?  Some

kind of elaborate practical joke?

At my 40th reunion, we delivered a

casket to the Class president's

hotel room and --

VOICE

Quiet.

VOICE (cont'd)

Where are you going?

PARRISH

I - I - uh --

VOICE

The great Bill Parrish at a loss for

words?  The man from whose lips fall

'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses-

sion'...all those admonitions about

being 'deliberately happy', what

there is no sense 'living your life

without...', all the sparks and

energy you give off, the rosy advice

you dispense in round, pear-shaped

tones --

PARRISH

What the hell is this?  Who are you?

VOICE

Just think of millenniums multiplied

by aeons compounded by infinity,

I've been around that long, but it's

only recently that your affairs here

have piqued my interest.  Call it

boredom, the natural curiosity of

me, the most lasting and significant

element in existence has come to see

you.

PARRISH

About what?

VOICE

I want to have a look around before

I take you.

PARRISH

'Take me'...?  Where?

VOICE

It requires competence, wisdom,

experience -- all those things they

say about you in testimonials --

and you're the one.

PARRISH

'The one' to do what?

VOICE

Show me around.  Be my guide.  And

in return, you get...

PARRISH

(breathless)

Get what?

VOICE

Time.

PARRISH

What the hell are you talking about?

VOICE

Watch it!

PARRISH

I'm sorry --

VOICE

In return you'll receive minuets, days,

weeks, I'm not going to go into details

... what matters is that I stay

interested.

VOICE (cont'd)

...'Yes'.

PARRISH

Yes what?

VOICE

'Yes' is the answer to your ques-

tion.

PARRISH

What question?

VOICE

Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The

question you've been asking yourself

with increased regularity, at odd

moments, panting through the extra

game of handball, when you ran for

the plane in Delhi, when you sat up

in bed last night and hit the floor

in the office this morning.  The

question that is in the back of your

throat, choking the blood to your

brain, ringing in the ears over and

over as you put it to yourself --

PARRISH

The 'question' --

VOICE

(urging)

Yes, Bill.  The question.

PARRISH

...Am I going to die?

YOUNG MAN

Yes.

PARRISH

Am I dreaming this?

(Another moment)

Are you a dream?

YOUNG MAN

I am not a dream.

PARRISH

You're coming to 'take me'.  What is

that?  Who the hell are you?

PARRISH

You are --?

YOUNG MAN

(urging again)

'...Yes --'

YOUNG MAN (cont'd)

(gently)

Who am I?

PARRISH

...Death.

PARRISH (cont'd)

You're Death?

YOUNG MAN

Yes.

PARRISH

Death!

YOUNG MAN

That's me.

PARRISH

You're not Death.  You're just a kid

in a jacket and a pair of pants.

YOUNG MAN

The jacket and the pair of pants

came with the body I took.  Let me

ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?

PARRISH

You want me to be your guide --?

YOUNG MAN

You fill the bill, Bill.

PARRISH

I do?

(a moment)

How long will you be staying?

YOUNG MAN

You should hope quite a while.

PARRISH

And then --?

PARRISH (cont'd)

It's... it's... over.

LUISA (O.S.)

Mr. Parrish?

LUISA (cont'd)

Will the gentleman be staying for

dinner, sir?

YOUNG MAN

(to Luisa)

Yes.

(a polite afterthought)

Thank you.

YOUNG MAN (cont'd)

(to Parrish)

Where is dinner?

PARRISH

This is crazy -- you're not going to

eat dinner with us.

YOUNG MAN

Bill, I am eating dinner with you.

And your family.  And that's what

we're doing.  It's not open for

discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't

you understand?

YOUNG MAN (cont'd)

Good.  Now lead the way.

PARRISH

Excuse me?  Could I say something?

YOUNG MAN

Of course.

PARRISH

(quietly)

It just occurred to me --

YOUNG MAN

Speak up, please.

PARRISH

(louder)

When I introduce you, if I say who

you are, I don't think anyone will

stay for dinner.

YOUNG MAN

Then don't.

ALLISON

...Well, here's another possibility.

It's a little last minute, but how does

this strike you?  Kaleidoscopes. Little

gold kaleidoscopes.  Some German firm

went kerplunkt, Tiffany's picked these

things up, they're perfect party favors,

however they're not personal, they're

winter scene or something, snow-flakes

and dachshunds...

ALLISON (cont'd)

(to the Young Man)

Hi there --

YOUNG MAN

Hello.

PARRISH

Uh -- sorry -- to have stepped away

for so long -- uh -- this is a

friend of mine I asked to drop by --

we got to talking and stuff -- uh --

he's going to join us for dinner --

um --

ALLISON

(to the Young Man)

Hello, how nice to meet you.  And

wouldn't it be nicer if my father

would introduce you?

YOUNG MAN

(to Allison)

'...How nice to meet you.'

PARRISH

Oh, I'm sorry.  This is my daughter,

Allison, and her husband, Quince,

Drew, my number one, works with me...

ALLISON

(prompting)

Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?

PARRISH

A name?

DREW

(pleasantly, going

along with the joke)

Yeah, something he goes by --

PARRISH

Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh --

this is --

ALLISON

Daddy!  Come on, a name.

DREW

Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing

me.

PARRISH

Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone

right out of my head --

DREW

What?!

PARRISH (cont'd)

I'm sorry.  This is - uh - uh...

PARRISH (cont'd)

Joe!

ALLISON

Joe...

DREW

Just plain 'Joe'?

ALLISON

Love that name.

QUINCE

Me, too.  Hey, buddy!

DREW

'Joe...'

PARRISH

Yes.

DREW

Is there any more to it?

PARRISH

(alarmed)

What do you mean?

DREW

Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'

PARRISH

-- Black.

ALLISON

Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you,

Mr. Black.

QUINCE

'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost

two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in

1952.

JOE

Yes?

QUINCE

(to Joe)

You bet.  I'm kind of my Rotisserie

League.

JOE

Are you?

PARRISH

He is!  Let's sit down --

ALLISON

(to Joe)

Paillarde of veal.

QUINCE

Yeah, they hit the calf over the

head with a mallet and then Luisa

hits it again in the kitchen.

ALLISON

Honey --!

QUINCE

You know what I'm saying, Joe?

JOE

No --

PARRISH

(laughing emptily)

Joe knows what you're saying, just

being polite --

DREW

(to Joe)

Have we met?

PARRISH

Uh -- he's from out of town --

QUINCE

How long you here, Joe?

JOE

As long as it takes.

DREW

You and Bill old friends?

PARRISH

No --

DREW

(to Joe)

I get the feeling you've done some

business before.

JOE

We have an arrangement now.

DREW

What side of the industry did you

say you were on?

JOE

I didn't say.

DREW

(to Parrish)

Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I

have the feeling you guys got the

broad strokes already.  Need any

help with the details?

DREW (cont'd)

I'm sorry -- business at dinner...

(to Joe)

Forgive me for being so rude.

JOE

Sure.

SUSAN

Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -

had to have dinner with my depart-

ment chief --

ALLISON

You ate?

SUSAN

...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't

miss a loose end meeting.  What's on

the table for discussion?  Party

favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --

SUSAN (cont'd)

What are you doing here?

PARRISH

(stunned)

You know each other?

SUSAN

(lightly)

We've met.

PARRISH

What?!

SUSAN

-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee

Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.

QUINCE

Well, I guess he's found one.

DREW

Joe, you do get around.

SUSAN

That's your name?

ALLISON

And isn't it a lovely one?  So

sturdy, so straight --

DREW

Incidentally, Joe, where're you

staying?

JOE

Here...

DREW

'Here'?

SUSAN

In this house?

QUINCE

Great!

PARRISH

Uh - will that hold you, Joe?

SUSAN

Incidentally, 'Joe' what?

JOE

Black.

QUINCE

Hey, this is fun.

SUSAN

So, what are you doing here?

SUSAN (cont'd)

Cat got your tongue?  You weren't so

silent this morning.

ALLISON

Now, I'm getting interested.  I want

to know more ---

PARRISH

(to Joe)

We've got some things to discuss.

DREW

(to Joe)

-- Did I hear 'business'?

SUSAN

What 'business'?

QUINCE

Don't bother asking, we already

tried.

JOE

It's so very nice to see you again.

SUSAN

Funny, I don't get that feeling.

Maybe it's because you found out

I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.

PARRISH

Cut it out, Susan.

(to Joe)

You and I've got to talk.  Big day

tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.

JOE

(to Susan)

Susan.

(to Allison)

Allison.

(to Quince)

Quince.

(to Drew)

Drew.

(to Parrish)

Bill...

(to the group)

Thank you.

PARRISH

Joe, that's the kitchen.

JOE

Thank you.

DREW

That was 'Joe'.

ALLISON

He's cute.

DREW

Very.

PARRISH

...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon-

certed, that stuff between you and

Susan -- uh -- threw me.

JOE

'Threw' you?  Where?

PARRISH

Shook me up.  I mean that you knew

her and everything --

JOE

I didn't know her.  The body I took

knew her.  The man she met in the

coffee shop this morning.  I - uh -

took him.

PARRISH

So there's nothing between you and

Susan?

JOE

No.

PARRISH

I wish you had said something to me

about staying here --

JOE

It hadn't occurred to me until then.

I was just having such a wonderful

time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm

here for?

JOE (cont'd)

You seem uncomfortable, Bill.

PARRISH

No, I'm okay with this - uh - I

think.  So --

PARRISH

(to Joe)

Bathroom...tub...towels, sauna --

PARRISH (cont'd)

...Chair, lamp, bed --

PARRISH (cont'd)

Box springs, they're assembled in

Jakarta.  Had to stay in a station

manager's house there unexpectedly

- best night's sleep I ever had.

Ordered twenty, they filled a con-

tainer and shipped them right over,

I've put one in every bedroom here

and in the country.

JOE

What a good idea.

PARRISH

Thank you.  Would you like the man's

name?

JOE

No.

PARRISH

If there is anything else, don't

hesitate --

JOE

I won't.

PARRISH

How long have I got?

JOE

You're putting me on the spot, Bill.

JOE (cont'd)

Let's put it this way.  When I go,

you go.

PARRISH

When you go, I go.

JOE

That's the best I can do.

(a moment)

...but minute-by-minute, I find

myself lingering.

PARRISH

...I just saw my doctor, he told me

everything was fine.

JOE

Your doctor?

(icily)

Did your doctor say anything about

a tiny, undetectable hole in your

aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab-

ly weak vein in the further reaches

of your famous brain?  Were they any

prognostications about the possibil-

ilites of a fatal collision on a golf

cart of suffocating in an avalanche

on a skin vacation in Gstaad?

PARRISH

No --

JOE

I hope you realize, Bill...in your

office this morning, that was your

time.

PARRISH

Closer than that.

JOE (cont'd)

...But meanwhile, you are still

here.  Count your blessings.  Call

it gravy, frosting on the cake,

whatever it is you say.

PARRISH

Well, thank you for letting me know.

JOE

Not at all.

PARRISH

And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.

JOE

Good night to you, Bill.

LUISA

...Miss Allison asked if you would

like to have your dinner kept warm?

PARRISH

No. Thanks, Luisa.

LUISA

Very good, sir.

PARRISH

Luisa --

PARRISH (cont'd)

Mr. Black's luggage was misplaced by

the airlines.  Would you mind get-

ting a few things together for him?

A couple of suits, some shirts,

ties, underwear, shoes.  Have Coyle

take his measurements off what he is

wearing tonight.

LUISA

Certainly, sir.

COYLE

Yes, sir?

JOE

Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet

you.

COYLE

Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.

JOE

(to Coyle)

What are you eating.

COYLE

You mean this, sir?

COYLE (cont'd)

Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter.

JOE

(carefully)

'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.

(a moment)

You like it?

COYLE

I would say, sir, it is right up

there with Jif and Skippy.  But

miles ahead of Peter Pan.

(another moment)

Like a taste?

COYLE (cont'd)

You're a peanut butter man now, eh,

sir?

JOE

Yes, I am.  I thoroughly enjoyed

this - uh - peanut butter.

(to the staff)

And I thoroughly enjoyed meeting

you.

JOE (cont'd)

I'll be moseying on.

SUSAN

What are you doing here?

JOE

I'm lost.

SUSAN

-- Can't seem to escape you today.

JOE

I'm sorry.

SUSAN

Hand me one of those, will you?

SUSAN (cont'd)

You must have something really big

going on with my father --

JOE

'Big'?

SUSAN

You appear at his side out-of-the-

blue, stay at his house, eat dinner

with his family, it's practically a

first.  You're in the red-hot center

of big business and I thought you

were a regular Joe.

JOE

I am Joe.

SUSAN

Not the one I met this morning, hit-

ting on me in as nice a way as I've

been hit on in a long time, but the

moment you find out I'm my Dad's

daughter, you act like a stranger.

JOE

That is not my intention.

SUSAN

What are your intentions?  To make

little dreams in coffee shops, turn

a woman's head, and I don't mind

admitting it was turned, I liked it,

but ten hours later I feel like a

fool.  I don't get it.  You, my

father, here in this house, the cof-

fee shop, it's making me upset, and

I don't like being upset.  Who are

you anyway?  And what are you eating?

JOE

(mumbles)

Peanut butter.

JOE (cont'd)

But it's gone now.

SUSAN

You act like you never had peanut

butter before --

JOE

I haven't.

SUSAN

-- What kind of childhood did you

have?

JOE

Do you love Drew?

SUSAN

Come again?

JOE

When you put your mouth to his,

Susan, it seems a frequent thing.

SUSAN

Drew is none of your damn business.

Nor is where I put my mouth.

JOE

I'm sorry.  Do you live here?

SUSAN

No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then

I'm going home.

JOE

I guess what I'm trying to say is --

I'd like us to be friends.

SUSAN

I've got plenty of friends.

JOE

I don't have any.

SUSAN

I can see why.

JOE

...I didn't mean to offend you at

dinner.  I'm not quite at home some-

times with people.  I get busy doing

- uh - what I do, and I don't seem to

have developed --

SUSAN

Yes --?

JOE

I have a certain function to per-

form, and that seems to take all

of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh -

I speculate - uh - I haven't left

room for - uh - anything else.

SUSAN

I'm sorry to say I know what you're

saying.

JOE

Susan?

SUSAN

Yes?

JOE

Did you know you have a wet spot on

your shoulder?

SUSAN

Goodnight, Joe.

JOE

Goodnight to you, Susan.

SUSAN

Shall we dance?

SUSAN (cont'd)

Joe --

JOE

Yes?

SUSAN

I think you want to go to the west

wing.  Through there.

JOE

(after a moment)

Thank you.

CUT TO:

PARRISH

Good morning.

JOE

Good morning, Bill.

PARRISH

How are you?  How're you feeling?

JOE

'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you

feel?

PARRISH

Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well.

This is crazy.  This is the left-

field thing of all time.  What do I

do?  What do I tell my family?

JOE

Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything,

Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we

had last night.  I felt as if I were

being treated like a person.  'Joe'

this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile

- Quince passed me the rolls -- no

'rapture' or 'passion' or any of

those mighty things you seem so

intent on imparting, but I am cer-

tain, should you - uh - say - uh -

who I am - our adventure would end

abruptly.

JOE (cont'd)

But I did so enjoy your family.

PARRISH

What about my family?  This 'adven-

ture' involved only me, right?

PARRISH (cont'd)

Tell you what, you promised that it's

going to be only me and --

JOE

And what?

PARRISH

And I won't tell anyone who you are.

JOE

Sounds fair enough.

PARRISH

It is a deal?

JOE

A 'deal'?

PARRISH

You give your word, I give mine --

that we'll do what we say.  It's a

truth exchanged between two people.

JOE

Bill --

PARRISH

Yes?

JOE

You've got a deal.

JOE (cont'd)

This is great!

(a moment)

Now what do we do?

PARRISH

Shake hands.

PARRISH

You know, I got to thinking last

night -- with you here, and seem-

ingly occupied, how's your work

going - uh - elsewhere?

JOE

When you were shaving this morning,

you weren't just shaving, right?

PARRISH

What do you mean?

JOE

You were hatching ideas, making

plans, arriving at decisions, right?

PARRISH

I guess so.

JOE

So you understand the concept then.

When you're busy here, your work,

what your task is, is being executed

elsewhere.

PARRISH

Of course.

JOE

So you've grasped the idea.  Con-

gratulations.  Now multiply it by

infinity and take it to the depth

of forever, and you still will

have barely a glimpse of what I

am talking about.

PARRISH

Joe --?

JOE

Yes, Bill.

PARRISH

How about giving a guy a break?

JOE

Make an exception?

PARRISH

There's one to every rule.

JOE

Not this.

PARRISH

-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still

young, this is not my time --

JOE

That's what everybody says.

PARRISH

I'm not everybody.

JOE

That's what everybody says.

PARRISH

I want to live.

JOE

I understand.

JOE (cont'd)

But you can't.

PARRISH

What's it like?

JOE

What do you mean?

PARRISH

What's it like where I'm going?

JOE

Can you keep a secret?

PARRISH

Yes.

JOE

So can I.

JAIME

Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

PARRISH

Good morning, Jaime.

JAIME

Knight's Reward in the 4th at

Calder --

JAIME (cont'd)

-- A closer in today with cheap

speed.  The colt will come from the

clouds and boom!  Fifty-eight dollar

horse.  I get you down, Mr. Parrish,

just say the word.

PARRISH

(smiles)

I'm sorry, not today, Jaime.

PARRISH (cont'd)

(to Joe)

You know, everyday I've walked into

this building, Jaime gives me a

horse.

(a moment)

I wonder if any of them won.

PARRISH

-- And call my family, I'd like them

to come over for dinner tonight.

JENIFER

Didn't the family get together last

night --?

PARRISH

(remonstrating, gently)

Jennifer.

JENIFER

Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.

PARRISH

(to Joe)

Perhaps you would like to wait in my

office --?

JOE

No.

PARRISH

What I'm trying to say is this is a

Board meeting and you are not a mem-

ber of the Board.

JOE

I'm sure you'll see to it that it

won't be a problem.

PARRISH

(to the Board)

-- This is Joe Black, a personal

associate of mine - uh - he'll be

joining us today.  I know it's --

uh -- unusual, and my apologies --

and Drew -- uh -- carry on.

DREW

(after a moment, to

Joe)

Nice to see you.  I didn't expect

you, but certainly you can't get

enough of a good thing.

JOE

Thank you.

DREW

(to the Board)

The Board of Parrish Communications -

is hereby called to order.  Our sole

order of business is an acceptance

of John Bontecou's generous offer

and --

JOE

(to Drew)

Do you have any more of these deli-

cious cookies?

JOE (cont'd)

And a cup of tea.  With milk, I

think.  I'd like to try it English-

style.  Yes, a cup of tea with milk.

DREW

Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about

some water?

JOE

Why yes, thank you.

DREW

Hot or cold.

JOE

Cold.

DREW

And a glass.

PARRISH

(quietly, indicating a

chair)

Would you like to sit down, Joe?

JOE

Yes.

DREW

To review -- we're really crossing

the 't's and dotting the 'i's here.

Bill had a great and conclusive

meeting with John Bontecou yester-

day, all that remains for us is to

put it to a vote.

PARRISH

(emptily)

Thank you, Drew.

PARRISH (cont'd)

Umm -- I did enjoy -- or rather I

was interested in meeting John yes-

terday -- impressive... I suppose...

But it did get me to thinking.  I

started in this business because

this is what I wanted to do.  I knew

I wasn't going to write the Great

American Novel, but I also knew

there was more to life than buying

something for a dollar and selling

it for two.  I wanted to give the

news to the world, and I wanted to

give it unvarnished.  The more we

all know about each other, the

greater the chance we will survive.

Sure, I want to make a profit, you

can't exist without one but John

Bontecou is all profit.  If we give

him license to absorb Parrish

Communications, and he has his eye

on a few others after us, we'll be

appointing him to the position he

craves -- Gatekeeper.  In order to

reach the world you will have to go

through John Bontecou.  And not only

will you have to pay him to do this,

far more expensive, you'll have to

agree with him.  Reporting the news

is a privilege and a responsibility

and it is not exploitable.  Parrish

Communications has earned this priv-

ilege, John Bontecou wants to buy

it.  As your chairman, I urge you to

agree this company is not for sale.

DREW

(carefully)

...Sounds like you're not leaving

much room for discussion.

PARRISH

(to the Board)

Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm

reversing my field.

DREW

That's your privilege, Bill.  But

given our needs, given the absolute

necessity for growth, given the fu-

ture, the truth is... joining John

Bontecou is every bit as certain as -

Death and Taxes.

JOE

'Death and Taxes'?

DREW

Yes.

JOE

"Death and Taxes"?

DREW

Yes.

JOE

What an odd pairing.

DREW

It's just a saying, Mr. Black,

JOE

Of whom?

DREW

It doesn't matter.

JOE

Then why did you bring it up?

DREW

You're not familiar with the phrase,

"In this world, nothing is certain

but Death and Taxes"?

PARRISH

I am now.

DREW

Glad I could be of some help.

PARRISH

Shall we adjourn?

DREW

But the matter's still on the table,

Bill --

SLOANE

Why don't we let it rest for the

moment?  Give it some air?

PARRISH

Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall

we?

JOE

(to Drew)

Those cookies were excellent.

DREW

Who is that guy?

DREW (cont'd)

Felicia?

FELICIA (O.S.)

Yes, sir?

DREW

Get me a Field Background check on

Joe Black.  Litigations. Bankrupt-

cies.  Credit ratings.  The works.

Got it?

PARRISH

-- What's the deal here?  Are you

going to be breathing down my neck

right 'til the very end?

JOE

I don't understand.

PARRISH

...I'd like to be alone for a while.

JOE

Are you sad, Bill?

PARRISH

Yes, I am.  There's a research lib-

rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't

you go down and read some magazines?

JOE

You're not thinking of going some-

where, are you, Bill?

PARRISH

Joe, could I ask you to take a walk?

Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll

be seeing you.

JOE

Of course.

PARRISH

(prompting)

Now I'd like to be alone.

JOE

Oh.  Okay.

PARRISH

Here -- this will hold you for a

while.

PARRISH (cont'd)

You know about money, don't you?

JOE

It can't buy happiness?

PARRISH

Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of

the city.

JOE

No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.

SUSAN

Joe --

JOE

How nice you look.  Is that your

uniform?

SUSAN

Why did you come here?

SUSAN (cont'd)

Are you ill?

JOE

Oh goodness, no.

SUSAN

Then why are you here, Joe?

JOE

I came to see you.

SUSAN

I don't have any time to see you

now.  I'm doing grand rounds and

then I'm examining back-to-back

patients until dinner and then --

JOE

Very well, I'll watch.

SUSAN

Watch me do what?

JOE

Whatever you do.

SUSAN

That's impossible.  I'm a doctor,

I'm --

JOE

And I'll be a visitor.

SUSAN

Patients have visitors, not doctors.

JOE

I don't mind --

TEENA

(urgently)

Miss?  Miss Doctor?

SUSAN

(gently)

Just a minute, please.

TEENA

Please.  My momma's sicker'n he

is.

EASTER

Obeah.

TEENA

No, Momma.

EASTER

Obeah mon.  I gonna die.

TEENA

Momma, stop it. Is just a man.

SUSAN

(to Teena)

What's obeah?

TEENA

Bad spirit.  She just all fever, she

don' mean nothin'.  Please help us?

SUSAN

Have you filled out the insurance

forms?

JOE

No obeah, sister.  No duppy, no

jumbie.  Evera ting gon' be irey.

JOE (cont'd)

Go wi' de doctor lady.  Momma be

fine.

EASTER

Don' leave!?

TEENA

(pleading)

Momma.

EASTER

(with certainty)

Obeah.

JOE

Obeah evil.  I not evil.

EASTER

What you then?

JOE

I from dat nex' place.

EASTER

You wait here'n to take us?  Like

you bus driver to dere?

JOE

(smiles)

No, no.  I on holiday.

EASTER

(looks around, dubious)

Some spot you pick.

EASTER (cont'd)

Pain is bad.

JOE

I nuttin' to do wi' dat.

EASTER

Make it go 'way.

JOE

Doctor lady make it irey.

EASTER

Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru.

Make it go 'way.

JOE

Can't, sistah.

EASTER

(adamant, pleading)

Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex'

place.

JOE

Not time yet.

EASTER

Make it time.

JOE

Can't feel wi' de way tings gotta

be, Easter.

EASTER

(to Joe)

Please...

TEENA

Come now, Momma.

JOE

Close your eyes, Easter.

JOE (cont'd)

Soon.

SUSAN

(to Teena)

Go with her.  I'll be right there.

JOE

She's in a great deal of pain.

SUSAN

Yes.

SUSAN (cont'd)

Have you spent a lot of time in the

islands?

JOE

Some.

JOE (cont'd)

I - uh - I - realize now - uh - my

being here - um - your patient --

this is not really appropriate --

and I - uh --

SUSAN

Don't apologize.  There's nothing

to be sorry for -- every hospital

should have someone like you.

SUSAN (cont'd)

Well...I'm glad you came.

JOE

Thank you.  I'm so very glad to be

here.

JOE (cont'd)

I guess you're busy --

SUSAN

Yes.

JOE

Well, I could come again some other

time.

SUSAN

Joe, I'm with Drew.

JOE

(sincerely)

Not now.

JOE (cont'd)

Don't you want me to come again...?

SUSAN

I have to go, I'm sorry to say --

JOE

Be sorry for nothing.

SUSAN

Yes.  Well...thank you, Joe.

JOE

Good-bye, Susan.

JOE

Are you going to eat your lunch

PARRISH

It's all yours.

PARRISH (cont'd)

Good?

JOE

Excellent.  What is it?

PARRISH

Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A

little Coleman's mustard.

JOE

Truly - uh - splendid.

PARRISH

Glad you like it.  My wife turned me

onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan --

that was my wife --

JOE

(familiarly)

Uh-huh.

PARRISH

Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy

as roast beef, not as boring as

chicken.  She knew stuff like that.

PARRISH (cont'd)

-- Everything reminds me of her --

there isn't a day that goes by that

I don't think about her -- One day

she was here.  The next day she was

gone.  What are you going to do? --

I guess you've heard all this a

trillion times before.

JOE

And more.

PARRISH

Why didn't you stop me?

JOE

Well...I don't know.

JOE (cont'd)

How was it the first time you met

her?

PARRISH

I thought you'd heard a trillion

times --

JOE

This part I'm interested in.

PARRISH

She had on this little blue suit --

with a little white collar that had

little red piping on it --

PARRISH (cont'd)

You could have put her under glass

and I would have just stood and

looked at her.  But when she spoke

-- I loved the sound of her voice

and her laugh --

(a moment)

-- I couldn't get enough of her --

and gradually -- or maybe it wasn't

gradually -- I realized I couldn't

live without her.

DREW

May I interrupting?

JOE

Yes.

PARRISH

No.

DREW

(to joe)

'Just kidding'?

PARRISH

Sit down, Drew.

DREW

Before I do --

(glances at Joe)

I was hoping we might be alone,

Bill.

PARRISH

Joe and I have no secrets from each

other.

DREW

(to Joe)

How nice for you both.

DREW (cont'd)

Bill, pardon my candor, but I was

confounded by your decision this

morning.

PARRISH

Why?

DREW

I was hired, you told me, to help

bring Parrish Communications into

the 21st Century.  This merger is

the vehicle --

JOE

Perhaps a merger is a way to bring

Bill's company into the 21st cen-

tury.  And perhaps it isn't.  And

perhaps cheating on your French

Philosophers exam at The Groton

School was an expedient way to get

your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't.

Be that as it may, Drew, a question

can often be argued both ways.

PARRISH

Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.

DREW

(to Parrish)

I thought this was practically a

done deal --

PARRISH

Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget

Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of

his fancy name and his fancy offer.

I'm not going for it.

DREW

Okay.

DREW (cont'd)

(to Parrish)

Can I invite myself to dinner

tonight?

(a moment)

Susan and I had ticket for the

Knicks game.  But she said you

guys were getting together --

PARRISH

Dinner?  Absolutely.

JOE

Absolutely.

DREW

(to Joe)

Damn decent of you.

JOE

Why, at this juncture, are you

letting yourself be so concerned

by business matters?

PARRISH

I don't want anybody buying up my

life's work and turning it into

something it wasn't meant to be.  A

man wants to leave something behind.

And he wants it left behind the way

he made it.  And he wants it to be

run the way he run it -- with a sense

of honor, of dedication, of truth.

Okay?

JOE

Okay.

PARRISH

And I don't need your goddamn permis-

sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't

need anyone to tell me how to run my

life.

JOE

Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a

heart attack and ruin my vacation.

ALLISON

(to Susan)

...We're never all together two

nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas,

Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's

going on?

SUSAN

Nothing's going on.  Maybe he

doesn't want to be alone.  He's go-

ing to be sixty-five in a minute --

ALLISON

...I don't know, Daddy seems funny

to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's

like he dropped from the clouds...

ALLISON (cont'd)

...When Daddy walked in with him, he

couldn't even remember his name.  Now

he's his house guest.  And you know

how he hates house guests.  What is

going on?

DREW

(to Susan and Allison)

Good question.

ALLISON

-- But he does seem very nice.

SUSAN

You think so?

QUINCE

(to Parrish)

...I read you all the way on the

Bontecou thing, and I know where

you're coming from.  And I'm with

you a hundred and one percent.

PARRISH

Thank you, Quince.

QUINCE

But I've got to tell you, if mergers

are in the wild, I've got some great

prospects I've developed.  I want to

talk to you about them next week.

PARRISH

Next week?

QUINCE

Yeah.  Or the week after.

QUINCE (cont'd)

No good?

PARRISH

No, anything is possible.

(lightly)

It's up to Joe.

QUINCE

Joe, you don't know how glad I am

you're aboard.  Anybody who can take

some of the weight off the old man,

I'm in his corner.

JOE

That's very gracious of you, Quince.

QUINCE

No problem.  I'll leave you two

alone.  I can tell you guys have

something on the fire --

ALLISON

(to Parrish)

Did you know twenty-six members of

your rifle company are coming?

PARRISH

Who?

ALLISON

From the Korean War.

PARRISH

Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.

ALLISON

Whatever it was, they'll be here.

We sent out invitations to everyone,

plane tickets included -- the RSVP's

are amazing.  A few of them we didn't

hear from, and some of them are dead,

of course --

PARRISH

Of course.

ALLISON

(a moment)

You know, we're going to give this

party for you whether you like it or

not.

PARRISH

I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I

don't seem more appreciative.

ALLISON

(resignedly)

That's okay, Daddy.

QUINCE

...I know you're down, but you know

when you're down, Drew, there's no

place to go but up.

DREW

Thanks, Quince.

QUINCE

Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some

other merger possibilities up my

sleeve, and I'm putting them to see

old man.

DREW

Are you?

QUINCE

We'll do it together.  I'll clue you

in.  Timing's got to be right.  The

old man says it's up to Joe.

DREW

'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his

words?

QUINCE

Yeah.

DREW

'It's up to Joe', huh?

QUINCE

Yeah, that's what he said.

DREW

Well, that's very interesting.

QUINCE

I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat

guy.

DREW

Yeah.  Neat.

JOE

I wanted to apologize, Susan --

SUSAN

I thought you said 'Be sorry for

nothing'.

JOE

Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding

on you this afternoon.

SUSAN

It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it

was, it turned out to be welcome.

JOE

I appreciate you --

SUSAN

Excuse me?

JOE

I mean I appreciate that.

SUSAN

And I appreciate you, too.

JOE

(delighted)

You do?  Well, thank you very much.

PARRISH

I was a little abrupt with you this

afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want

you to know I value your advice.

DREW

As much as Joe's?

DREW (cont'd)

Who is this man?  He's giving

ubiquitous a bad name.

PARRISH

You're competitive soul, Drew.

That's what makes you a great addi-

tion to the money.  Joe is just...

around.

DREW

For how long?  And why?

PARRISH

Please.  Don't worry about him.  And

above all, don't antagonize him.

DREW

Boss's orders, huh?  I'm great at

following them.  And I think I'll

start right now.

ALLISON

Dinner's ready, everybody!

DREW

I have a confession to make to you,

Joe.

DREW (cont'd)

Do you want to hear it?

JOE

(pleasantly)

No.

DREW

Well, I'm going to tell you anyway.

I did cheat on that exam at Groton.

But so did twenty-six other guys,

and nobody ever mentioned it until

today.  And I'm expecting you won't

mention it again.  I don't know who

you are and where you're getting

your information, but I'm willing to

pretend I did not hear it, and let

bygones be bygones.  But can I tell

you something else, it'd be nice to

see the big guy without you next to

him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do

you hold his dick for him when he

goes to take a leak?  You know some-

times somebody would like a few min-

utes alone with W.P.  That means

without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.

PARRISH

-- I - uh - want to thank you all

for coming - uh - my family --

PARRISH (cont'd)

-- Allison and Quince, Susan -- and

the other members --

PARRISH (cont'd)

-- I'm so happy when we can get

together -- I mean I know you all

have busy lives --

SUSAN

Look who's talking.

ALLISON

(a laugh)

Yeah, speak for yourself.

PARRISH

Anyway -- I remember when you were

little girls --

QUINCE

I love little girls --

PARRISH

And now you're all grown up -- and

I'm - uh - um --

PARRISH (cont'd)

I had some words all prepared but

now I've forgotten them - uh - um -

wait a minute.

PARRISH (cont'd)

Uh, it's gone...um -- it was on the

tip of my tongue.

SUSAN

It'll come back, Daddy.

PARRISH

Will it?...

PARRISH (cont'd)

Anyway, I'd like to go on but...

ALLISON

(tentatively)

Daddy, you could sit down if you

wanted to.

PARRISH

There is so much I would like to say

-- but I can't --

(another moment)

So I better sit down.  Carry on,

everybody.

PARRISH (cont'd)

One other thing -- why don't we all

have dinner again tomorrow night?

ALLISON

Dinner?  Again?

SUSAN

Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?

PARRISH

(with great sincerity)

No.

SUSAN

We'll be here.

QUINCE

You bet.

ALLISON

With bells on.

JOE

(to Coyle)

I would prefer some peanut butter.

COYLE

How would you like that, sir?  On

some kind of toast?

JOE

Toast?  No...just the butter.

COYLE

Right away.

SUSAN

Why do you love peanut butter so

much?

JOE

(intimately)

I don't know.

SUSAN

I adore things like that....food I

can't do without.  Don't you?

JOE

Yes...

SUSAN

It comforts you, doesn't it?

JOE

(captivated)

Yes...I've found that it does.

DREW

Mind if I throw up?

PARRISH

(admonishing gently)

Please, Drew.

JOE

(to Susan)

I'm very concerned about the woman

you attended to today.

SUSAN

I am, too.

JOE

Has her pain abated?

SUSAN

We're doing what we can for her.

But it doesn't look good.

JOE

I'm sorry to hear that.

DREW

Who are we talking about?

JOE

(to Susan)

But I know she's grateful for the

care you're giving her.

DREW

Is this a state secret or are we

being excluded just for the fun of

it?

JOE

(to Drew)

Susan's patient is whom we are

talking about.

SUSAN

Joe visited the hospital today.

ALLISON

Did he?  That's more than we get to

do.

DREW

Well, maybe next time Joe goes,

he'll take us along.

JOE

Perhaps you could remind me.

DREW

I'll make a note of it.  Anything

else?

QUINCE

I'd like to come, too.  See Susan

strut her stuff.

DREW

You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination

Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour

Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to

you?

JOE

Susan is a wonderful doctor.

DREW

I have to go, Bill -- it's been a

helluva day.  Need a few minutes to

sort everything out.

PARRISH

Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.

DREW

Sure.

PARRISH

Why did you go to the hospital?

JOE

I don't know.

PARRISH

You were just curious?

JOE

I guess...

PARRISH

About Susan?

JOE

I wouldn't put it that way.

PARRISH

What way would you put it?

JOE

You tell me, Bill.

PARRISH

How about you telling me?  When I

ask a simple question, I expect a

straight answer.  That's what I'm

used to.  Anybody who doesn't give

it to me, I fire.

JOE

Are you going to fire me, Bill?

SUSAN

...See you tomorrow night.

DREW

Include me out.  I've had enough of

the conversations.

SUSAN

You don't mean that.  You wouldn't

disappoint Daddy --

DREW

Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got

Joe.

(a moment)

And so do you.

SUSAN

Drew, you're out of line.

DREW

That may be.  But I don't like the

fucker.  I don't like the way he

looks at you and talks to you.  And

vice versa.

SUSAN

Sorry, but I like the way he looks

and talks to me.  And vice versa.

Okay?

DREW

No, not okay.  I thought we had a

good thing going here.

(a moment)

It shows you never know.

SUSAN

Well... goodnight.

DREW

Yeah.  Goodnight.

SUSAN

How long have you been standing

there?

JOE

I don't like the way Drew spoken to

you.  But I feel better about it now

because of the way you spoke back.

SUSAN

Tell me about yourself, Joe.  Who

you are.  What you're doing with my

father.

SUSAN (cont'd)

So you're not going to tell me?

SUSAN (cont'd)

You're married, aren't you?

JOE

Why?

SUSAN

Because guys who never say anything

about themselves are always married.

SUSAN (cont'd)

So you are married.

JOE

No, I'm not.

SUSAN

Girlfriend?

JOE

No.

SUSAN

Gay?

JOE

No.

SUSAN

Then tell me, Joe, how come a man

as attractive, intelligent, well-

spoken ,diffident in the most sed-

uctive way, and yet powerful, is all

alone in this world?

SUSAN (cont'd)

I'm sorry, I don't want to pry and

you don't want to tell me.  So let's

leave it a mystery.  That's the way

you want it, isn't it?

JOE

Thank you, I appreciate that.

SUSAN

Where are you going?

JOE

(softly)

To bed.

SUSAN

(suddenly fragile)

'To bed'?

JOE

Yes.  I'm tired.

PARRISH

That was wonderful.

SUSAN

Yeah, it's good to get together.

PARRISH

Do you mind if I raise a little

caution flag?

SUSAN

Raise away.

PARRISH

What is the nature of your interest

in Joe?

SUSAN

Well, remember how you told me about

"lightning striking"?  The nature of

it's in there somewhere.

PARRISH

I won't say you may be getting onto

shaken ground --

SUSAN

Then what will you say?

PARRISH

I don't think this is the lightning

you are looking for.  Drew's a good

man.  I know I didn't seem to be

completely in his corner before, but

I've come to appreciate --

SUSAN

Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo-

ten?  What's going on?

PARRISH

Nothing.

SUSAN

When you say 'nothing' that way,

it's not nothing.

PARRISH

Then what is it?

SUSAN

It's something.

SUSAN (cont'd)

G'night, Daddy.  See you tomorrow.

This is getting interesting.

CUT TO:

DREW

...I know you're all as uncomfor-

table as I am to be meeting without

Bill, but I got a call last night

from John Bontecou.  Not only is he

still interested, he is sweetening

his offer.

(a moment)

Although it pains me to say it, in

my opinion Bill Parrish dealt with

us peremptorily in dismissing any

deal with Bontecou.  Therefore, I'm

sorry to say that if we are to exam-

ine this new offer responsibly as

the Board of Directors of Parrish

Communications, we must do so with-

out its Chairman.

(another moment)

Oh yes, there is one additional

element: Bontecou is so anxious to

get us, he said he'd take Parrish

Communications with our Chairman or

without.

DREW (cont'D)

It's no surprise if I suggest to you

that the Bill Parrish we know is not

the Bill Parrish you saw yesterday.

You heard that speech -- some strange

emotional rationale to buttress a

knee-jerk rejection of a legitimate

offer.  Does it not strike you that

something is possibly affecting this

man's judgement?  More specifically

-- his judgement to make a critical

business decision?

DREW (cont'D)

It's not pleasant to say the follow-

ing, but I would be remiss, in this

crisis, if I did not.  When we pre-

sent Bill with the improved Bontecou

offer, and if he refuses to let us

consider it -- once more makes an

adamant or emotional rejection -- we

will have no choice but to seek an

alternative.

SLOANE

And what would that be?

DREW

Bill's birthday is the day after

tomorrow.  There is a provisory by-

law in our charter.  Per the discre-

tion of the Board, Corporate off-

icers can be retired at age sixty-

five.

SLOANE

You're taking this too far, Drew.

DREW

Am I not obligated to?

DREW (cont'd)

How did this all come about?  Crisis

-- Bill Parrish, crisis -- his com-

pany, crisis for us.  I came about

with the arrival on the scene of --

Mr. Joe Black.  Mr. Joe who?  Joe

Black.  He attends our Board meet-

int, he sleeps at Bill's house, re-

sides in his office.  Never leaves

his side.  And, in my opinion, is

always in his ear.  Telling him what

to do and Bill is listening.  Who is

Joe Black?  What is his relationship

to Bill Parrish?  And most important,

what is behind his influence on our

Chairman?

SLOANE

You're building this thing up too

much, Drew.  He's had advisors be-

fore.  Nobody tells Bill what to do.

DREW

Thank you for coming.

SLOANE

Hello, Quince.

QUINCE

Hi, Ed, hi folks, I didn't know

everybody was going to be here, what

a nice surprise.  What's the big

confab?

SLOANE

(acidly)

This is a secret meeting.

DREW

(to Quince)

I hope you'll respect its nature --

What we're trying to do here is

gather our thoughts -- in light of

Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer

-- and make an appropriate presenta-

tion to him as to how we think the

company might proceed.  Won't you

share with our Board the information

you gave me last night?

QUINCE

Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got

good news.  As I was telling Drew,

I've been making a little hay while

the Bontecou sun was shining -- two,

possibly three new and boiling hot

prospects for merger.

DREW

How did Bill react to the leads

you've developed?

QUINCE

He was interested.

DREW

(prompting)

-- But he was concerned about the

timing?

QUINCE

The timing -- yes.  He says it's up

to Joe.

DREW

'It's up to Joe'?

QUINCE

That's what he said.

PARRISH

What is this?

ALLISON

Annie made them.

PARRISH

Who's Annie?

ALLISON

From La Rosette, only the greatest

pastry chef in America.

(pointing)

This is orange, from real Seville

oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille

crust, a little on the fanciful.

And a while, nothing like a good old

white cake, vanilla, with Angel food

but some maroons shavings thrown in.

PARRISH

I don't like cake.

ALLISON

It's for the party, Dad --

PARRISH

Oh, the goddam party --

ALLISON

'Goddam party'!

ALLISON (cont'd)

(to Quince)

Did you hear that?

QUINCE

This is great, honey.  The orange.

Has it got a little vodka in it?

Like that Finnish stuff, orange

vodka --

(to Parrish)

Put your lips around this one, Bill.

It's out of this world.

PARRISH

No thank you, Quince.

(to Allison)

I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at

this.  Why don't you choose whatever

cake you like?

ALLISON

I knew you were going to say that.

Tito Puente.  The old platoon.  Now

the cake.  You just don't care.  Why

did I do this?  I should have my head

examined.  I'm trying to throw the

party for the century for my father -

and you know what -- he doesn't give

a shit.

QUINCE

But he does give a shit.  Don't you,

Bill?

PARRISH

Yeah, I give a shit.

QUINCE

See.  There.  What'd I tell you?

QUINCE (cont'd)

Feel better?

ALLISON

Yeah, but --

QUINCE

But what?

ALLISON

What will I tell Annie?

PARRISH

This one.

QUINCE

The vodka.  What'd I tell you?

JOE

(to Quince)

Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth

leading killer of adult Western

males.

QUINCE

I didn't know that.

JOE

On the other hand, Winston Churchill

drank a bottle of cognac a day and

lived until he was ninety-one.

QUINCE

You're an original, Joe.  A little

hard to figure, maybe...

JOE

And you're a nice man, Quince.

QUINCE

Thanks.

JOE

You're welcome.

DREW

(to Parrish)

Sorry to intrude, Bill, but we've

got a bit of a crisis downtown --

it's not something we could talk

about on the phone.

DREW (cont'd)

The Board's real unhappy, Pappy --

they felt you dealt with them pre-

emptorily, you never gave them a

chance to speak --

PARRISH

What is there to say?  They know

what John Bontecou is -- and if they

didn't, they know now.

DREW

Yes, you made your feeling abun-

dantly clear.  Now they want to do

the same with theirs.

PARRISH

What are their feelings?

DREW

If I read this Board right now, they

want you to accept Bontecou's offer.

PARRISH

Over my dead body.

DREW

What do you think the Board is going

to say when I tell them that?

PARRISH

I don't care.

DREW

With all due respect, you damn well

better care because if you try to

stonewall them again, there'll be

blood on the floor.

PARRISH

Whose?

DREW

Yours.

PARRISH

I'm feeling real uncomfortable right

now because the guy who reports to

me is threatening me.

DREW

I'm just giving you the truth.  There

was a time when William Parrish liked

the truth.

PARRISH

I think it's time you went home,

Drew.

DREW

Certainly.  Goodnight.

SUSAN

Drew!

SUSAN (cont'd)

Never talk to my father like that

again.

DREW

Don't worry about it.  There's a

beginning and a middle and an end

to everything.  And I think I've

come to the end of my chapter with

the Parrishes.

DREW (cont'd)

And the end began with this guy.

DREW (cont'd)

Mr. Black --?  We ran a check on you

and you know what we came up with?

JOE

No, I don't --

DREW

Not good, not bad, you know what we

got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars,

no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.

DREW (cont'd)

All of a sudden a guy appears on the

scene with the Chairman of one of

the greatest communications corpora-

tions of the world, the boss makes

him privy to all the company's

secrets, he attends the Board meet-

ings, and us working stiffs with

MBA's up the ass and years and years

and years of experience, we're left

outside with our noses pressed

against the window.

DREW (cont'd)

This is a big-time operation, deal-

ing in big-time issues, demanding

big-time executives who make big-

time decisions.  So, Joe, why don't

you tell me exactly what it is

that's big time about you?

JOE

You first.

SUSAN

(to Drew)

Why don't you get off his case?

DREW

Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney

now?  Are we going to go to court?

Or are we going to go to bed?  And I

don't mean you and me.  I mean you

and him.

SUSAN

That's it.  It's over.  Get out.

DREW

So I guess a blowjob's out of the

question?

DREW (cont'd)

Did you say something?

JOE

Almost.

SUSAN

(to Drew)

I said get out.

JOE

What an angry fellow.

SUSAN

I'm sorry about --

JOE

Please.  We don't need to talk about

Drew.

SUSAN

No.  We don't.

SUSAN (cont'd)

Brave you had a chance to look at

Dad's rare books?  Jefferson's

Parliamentary Manual, a first

edition Bleak House --

JOE

I love your smell.

SUSAN

-- I guess you haven't.

SUSAN (cont'd)

I like your smell, too.

JOE

Thank you.

SUSAN

It was everything.

SUSAN (cont'd)

When I was little, my mother used to

say, "Darling, you could set your

heart by this clock".

JOE

-- Could you?

SUSAN

Never tried, 'til now.

(suddenly)

Joe, may I kiss you?

JOE

Why, yes.  Thank you.

SUSAN

You're welcome.

SUSAN (cont'd)

Thank you.

JOE

You're welcome.

SUSAN

Joe?

JOE

Yes?

SUSAN

I don't know who you are.

JOE

Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're

Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak

feeling in my knees --

SUSAN

And is your heart beating strangely?

JOE

Faster.  And I want the scent from

underneath your ears and the taste

of your lips and the touch of your

tongue to stay with me -- forever.

JOE (cont'd)

And you don't even have to say a

word.

SUSAN

I have to go home.

SUSAN (cont'd)

Don't I?

SUSAN

Goodnight, Daddy.

JOE

Hello, Bill.

PARRISH

(carefully)

Hello.  Would you like to join me,

Quince and Allison for a nightcap?

JOE

Um -- not right now.

PARRISH

Okay.  Goodnight.

JOE

Goodnight.

CUT TO:

JENIFER

Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

PARRISH

Good morning, Jennifer.

JENIFER

The Board is waiting.

PARRISH

What?

JENIFER

Didn't you call a Board meeting?

JENIFER (cont'd)

Yes, the members are waiting.  They

are in the Board room now.

PARRISH

Good morning.

DREW

Did you want to have a cup of coffee

or something, Bill?

PARRISH

I don't think so.  Do you?

DREW

(to Parrish)

To get to the point, we have re-

ceived new information from John

Bontecou concerning his desires for

this company to merge with his, and

we wanted to set the details before

you.

PARRISH

That's it?

DREW

Bontecou wants a quick response

and --

PARRISH

The answer is no, quick enough for

you?

DREW

Don't you want to hear the details?

PARRISH

I'm not interested in the details.

And I'm not interested in the big

picture either.  What I am inter-

ersted in is how my Board got conven-

ed behind my back, is entertaining a

further proposal from a man whom it

offends me to do business with,

moreover has the audacity to present

this to me like a prize fish, and I

am expected to clap for it like a

performing seal.  No, thank you.

DREW

So I am to understand from your re-

sponse that you do not want to hear

the details of Bontecou's offer?

PARRISH

Yes, you are to understand that, and

now may I ask you a question?

DREW

Certainly, Bill.

PARRISH

Are you running this Board or am I?

SLOANE

We're not getting anywhere here.

Why don't we take some of the best

out of this thing, let's consider

it coolly, let's take a week --

DREW

Bontecou wants a speedier response

than that.

SLOANE

He'll wait --

PARRISH

Doesn't need to.  Today, tomorrow,

a week from now -- 'a week from

now', who can think about a week

from now -- the answer is going to

be the same -- a loud, unmistakable,

all-inclusive, airtight -- 'No'.

PARRISH (cont'd)

That's it?  I've got a busy day

and this meeting has already set

me behind.  Shall we adjourn?

DREW

Before we do, while we're here,

there is a second question the

Board would like a response to,

a far simpler one.

DREW (cont'd)

Who is the man sitting to the right

of you?

PARRISH

I've already introduced Mr. Black to

you all.

DREW

But who is he?  What are his creden-

tials?  What is his relationship to

you?

DREW (cont'd)

The feeling of the Board is this: we

fear Mr. Black is not only influenc-

ing your decisions in regard to this

company, but that you are relying on

him to make them for you.

DREW (cont'd)

The lack of response, Bill, is not

appropriate.  We are your Board, we

have a right to know how you are

managing the operations of this

company, and most importantly, that

you have not delegated someone to do

it for you.

DREW (cont'd)

Okay, one more time.

DREW (cont'd)

Who is Joe Black?

DREW (cont'd)

(to the Board)

A motion has been brought before

the Board to invoke Article 19 of

the corporate charter.

PARRISH

In English, please.

DREW

Mandatory retirement upon our

Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.

DREW (cont'd)

At which time, the Chairman will be

named Emeritus, he will be welcome

to attend all meetings, and will

serve as International Spokesman for

the corporation plus, of course, a

settlement, a golden parachute of

such magnitude that his feet will

never touch the ground.

DREW (cont'd)

Please indicate your vote by a "Yes"

or "No".

DREW (cont'd)

The motion is passed.  We will of

course delay the announcement, out

of respect for our former Chairman,

until after the celebration of his

birthday this weekend.

PARRISH

Thank you for allowing me to save

face, Drew.

DREW

(to the Board)

The other motion before us is the

acceptance of John Bontecou's offer

to merge this corporation with

Bontecou International --

PARRISH

Joe?

JOE

(to the Board)

Who I am, and my relationship to

Bill, will be divulged in our own

good time.

SLOANE

(to Parrish)

...It's not over, 'til it's over.

PARRISH

Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings"

shit.

SLOANE

I still sense some doubt in this

group, we could turn it around.

You'll be up in the country?

PARRISH

Yes, the big 'celebration' of my

mandatory retirement birthday.

You're an honored guest, Eddie.

SLOANE

I'm going to stick it out here.  We

still have a shot.

QUINCE

What have you done?  You've gotten

the old man fired!

DREW

That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was

wobbling, mind you, but you stupid

the coup de grace.

QUINCE

I'm going to put a stop to this!

DREW

Quince, you can't unscramble

scrambled eggs.

QUINCE

But I didn't mean to do it!

DREW

The train's left the station, pal,

and you're aboard.  Would you like

to hear the silver lining?  Check

that, gold.  I've been working with

John Bontecou all along.  We had

a game plan -- acquire Parrish

Communications then break it apart

and peddle it piece-by-piece to the

highest bidder.  I set it up for

him, he smacks it out of the park.

DREW (cont'd)

Don't you know what this'll mean?

You'll be rich.  You'll sell your

stock, you can stop kissing ass --

What'll it feel like to be a man?

QUINCE

I don't want to get rich this way --

I'm going to expose you.

DREW

Go right ahead.  Tell William

Parrish how you betrayed him at

a secret Board meeting.  And tell

Allison how you got her father

fired -- and he lost his company.

DREW (cont'd)

It's just life, Quin-cee.

DREW (cont'd)

(to Quince)

Wake up and smell the thorns.

JOE

I'm sorry, Bill --

PARRISH

That's okay.

JOE

What's okay?

PARRISH

Just a manner of speaking.

PARRISH

(cont'd)

What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's

over.  We've got bigger fish to fry,

don't we, Joe?

JOE

'Fish'?

PARRISH

Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going

to take a nap.

PARRISH (cont'd)

Are you hungry?  Coyle will have

Luisa fix you something to eat.

JOE

I'm not hungry.

PARRISH

Then I can't help you.

SUSAN

You're here?

JOE

I am.

JOE (cont'd)

May I take your coat?

SUSAN

I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge

a little lunch, I was in the neigh-

borhood --

JOE

How beautiful.

SUSAN

Just throw it on the chair.

SUSAN (cont'd)

When I called, they said that you

and Daddy had just left the office.

JOE

He's taking a nap.

SUSAN

He must be tired -- this Bontecou

thing --

JOE

Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.

JOE (cont'd)

You must be hungry?

SUSAN

No, not anymore.  Are you?

SUSAN (cont'd)

(after a moment)

Are you cold?

JOE

...No.

SUSAN

Maybe it's the draft through the

door.

SUSAN

It's so wonderful to make love to

you.  It's like making love to some-

one who has never made love before.

JOE

Thank you.

SUSAN

Did you like making love to me?

JOE

I loved it.

SUSAN

More than you love peanut butter?

JOE

Yes!

SUSAN

Where are you going?

JOE

Nowhere?  I'm...here.

SUSAN

For how long?

JOE

Oh, I hope a long, long time.

SUSAN

Me, too.

JOE

What do we do now?

SUSAN

It will come to us.

JOE

Hello, Bill.

JOE (cont'd)

Did you have a nice nap?

PARRISH

I couldn't sleep.

JOE

I'm sorry to hear that.

PARRISH

No, I'll come down

PARRISH (cont'd)

What's going on?

PARRISH (cont'd)

I saw you kiss Susan.

JOE

Yes, I saw you see me.

PARRISH

Well, you're at the wrong place at

the wrong time with the wrong woman.

JOE

I'll be the judge of that.

PARRISH

I'm her father!

JOE

With all due respect, Bill, I'm not

asking your permission.

PARRISH

Well, you goddam well should.  You

walk into my life, give me the worst

news a guy can get, have me dancing

on the heads of pins with my busi-

ness and with my family, and now

you're spooning with my daughter.

JOE

'Spooning'?

PARRISH

Yes, and stop repeating everything I

sai, and turning it into a question.

Spooning, fooling around, God knows

what.  You arrive on the scene -- why

you picked me, I still don't under-

stand --

JOE

I picked you for your verve, your

excellence, and for your ability to

- how shall I say - instruct.  You've

lived a first-rate life.  And I find

it eminently usable.

PARRISH

What do you want?

PARRISH (cont'd)

Everybody wants something, Joe.

You've been taking me from pillar

to post here.  I thought I knew who

you were, and it wasn't a whole lot

of fun, however it was almost bear-

able.  Now I'm getting something

else from you, something very, very

strange -- what is it that you want,

Joe?

JOE

I'm only following the Parrish

bywords.  Looking for that 'ounce

of excitement', that 'whisper of a

thrill' -- What there is no sense

living your life without.  You know

what I mean, Bill.

PARRISH

You're violating the laws of the

universe.

JOE

This universe?

PARRISH

Any universe that exists or ever

existed.  You may be the pro, Joe.

But I know who you are.  And you're

all fucked up.

JOE

I don't like your tone, and I don't

like your references.

PARRISH

And I don't give a shit.

JOE

May I remind you this is not just a

dispute with a putative suitor, this

is me.  So watch it...Bill.

PARRISH

Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you

sonofabitch.

JOE

I told you, 'watch it'.

RECEPTIONIST

Can I help you?

JOE

Dr. Parrish.

RECEPTIONIST

She comes on at 6.

JOE

Oh.

EASTER

Mistah Bad News.  'Bout time you

show up.

JOE

Don' be facety, woman.

EASTER

None facety, mistah.  You come for

me?  Dat's good news.

JOE

No, I come to see Doctor.

EASTER

JOE

Nuthin'.

EASTER

Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?

JOE

Yes.

EASTER

My Doctor Lady?

JOE

Mine, too.

EASTER

You in love?

JOE

Yah.

EASTER

You loved back?

JOE

I am.

EASTER

She knows you real self?

JOE

She knows how she feel.

EASTER

(scoffing)

Rass!

JOE

(irritably)

Don' need you okayin'.

EASTER

Schoolboy tings is you head.

Badness for you, badness for her,

badness for me, lyin' here tumor,

big as breadfruit, poison my inners

an' waiting.

JOE

Brung you flowers and all I gettin's

facety back.

EASTER

(stubbornly)

Only flowers I wan' see's one's

over my peaceful self restin' in

the dutty.

JOE

Can do no right by people.  Come to

take, you wan' to stay, leave you

stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!

EASTER

You not in you right place, mistah.

EASTER (cont'd)

I ain' either.  No more.  You come

wi' me now.  Take me.

JOE

But I not lonely here.  Somebody

want me here.

EASTER

It nice it happen to you.  It like

you came to Cat Island and you had

a holiday, sun didn't burn you red,

just brown, sleep no mosquito eat

But trut' is, dat bound to happen,

you stay long enough.  So tak dat

nice picture home wi' you, but don'

be fooled.  We lonely here mostly,

too.  If we lucky, we got some nice

pictures.

JOE

(gently)

Got enough nice pictured, Easter.

JOE (cont'd)

G'bye, sistah.

PARRISH

Hello, honey.

SUSAN

Where's Joe?

PARRISH

Joe?

PARRISH (cont'd)

Joe's not around.

SUSAN

Where is he?

PARRISH

I don't know.

PARRISH (cont'd)

Why are you looking for Joe?

SUSAN

Because I was sitting in a staff

meeting, incredibly bored, my mind

kept wandering and the only place it

landed was -- Joe.

PARRISH

I don't understand.

SUSAN

Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all

those things you told me to wait

for.  Well, they've arrived.

PARRISH

This is crazy --

SUSAN

Why?  A man appears at your side,

almost never leaves it, you clearly

trust him, depend on him, I sense

you value him deeply, why aren't

those things good enough for me?

PARRISH

You don't know anything about Joe --

SUSAN

What are you afraid of, Dad?  That

I'll fall head over heels for Joe --

well, I have -- as you did with Mom.

(a moment)

That's always been standard,

whether you like or not.

PARRISH

Susan, I don't think Joe is going to

be with us long.

SUSAN

Where's he going?

PARRISH

I don't know, I can't say --

SUSAN

C'mon!  The guy's working with you.

You always know chapter and verse

about everyone who works --

PARRISH

In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I

just can't help you.  I only would

tell you -- that with Joe, you are

on very, very dangerous ground.

SUSAN

I love him.

PARRISH

I don't care if you love him!  I'm

telling you he's no good for you!

SUSAN

Of course not, Daddy.  I'm sorry.

SUSAN (cont'd)

I love you, too.

SUSAN (cont'd)

Lightning does strike.

CLERK

Change!  Change!

JOE

Why are you giving me money?

CLERK

Change.

JOE

I am who I am.  I cannot change.

CLERK

You change!

JOE

That's impossible.  You're wasting

your money.  I couldn't change even

if I wanted to.

JOE

Uh --

PARRISH

Yes?

JOE

-- I have the feeling that, all in

all, what I made this voyage for --

has served its purpose.

PARRISH

What are you saying, that it's time

to go?

PARRISH (cont'd)

I'm ready.

JOE

You are?

PARRISH

Yeah.

JOE

Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.

CUT TO:

MAY

(to Parrish)

Telephone call, sir.  Mr. Sloane

from New York.

PARRISH

Excuse me.

PARRISH

Eddie?

SLOANE (O.S.)

(speakerphone)

Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?

PARRISH

Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why

are you still down here?

SLOANE (O.S.)

(speakerphone)

The Board's working through the

weekend, trying up the loose ends

this damn thing.  But I want to give

it one more try, I'm still holding

out some hope.

PARRISH

Eddie, hold out all the hope you

want but, I promise you, it's hope-

less, it's over.  Come on up, let's

get drunk, if I had your shoulder

to lean on I might actually enjoy

this --

SLOANE (O.S.)

(speakerphone)

No, I'm going to stay down here,

keep my finger in the dike and maybe

by Monday, the waters could recede.

PARRISH

If you're trying to show me lay-

down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty,

forget it.

SLOANE (O.S.)

(speakerphone)

Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your

cake, blow out the candles and make

a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?

PARRISH

Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for

the memory.

ALLISON

Hi, Daddy, what do you think?

PARRISH

It's starting to grow on me.  But

what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?

ALLISON

The fountain is the Caspian Sea and

the Sea is serving up caviar.  The

'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for

Petrossian.  Of course, they also

stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.

PARRISH

Do they, m'dear?

ALLISON

-- Plus we've got a baritone with a

balalaika coming from The Russian

Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a

Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson

Eddy songs.

PARRISH

You are amazing.  Why, oh why,

Allison, are you doing all this?

ALLISON

I do it because I love you.  Because

everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher-

ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the

people who work for you, everybody

who's ever known you.

PARRISH

Yeah?  And what about my enemies?

ALLISON

They respect you.  Isn't that a kind

of love?

ALLISON (cont'd)

Above all, you've been a wonderful

father.

PARRISH

I haven't been the father to you

that --

ALLISON

That you've been to Susan?

PARRISH

I wasn't going to say --

ALLISON

But that's what you were thinking.

And that's okay.  Because I know you

love me.  Not like it is with Susan,

the way your eyes light up when she

comes in the room and the way she

always gets a laugh out of you, as

opposed to me when I walk in a room

and that look comes over your face,

"What does she want now?"

ALLISON (cont'd)

I already feel I've had everything I

could have wanted for my birthday --

PARRISH

Hey, there's lots to come.

(gesturing to me

activity)

A little excess -- like you love.

PARRISH

You know, darling, this is going to

be a wonderful party.

ALLISON

(gently)

Yes, it is.

QUINCE

Give me a Seagrams and '7'.

QUICNCE (cont'd)

No got?  Okay a double V.O., water

back.

AMBROSE

I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr.

Quince.

QUINCE

Okay, give me a bottle of wine.

AMBROSE

Red or white?

QUINCE

Both.

QUINCE (cont'd)

(to Joe)

Red or white?

JOE

No, thank you.

QUINCE

C'mon, have a drink.  You look like

you need one bad as me.

JOE

Do I?  I'm a little confused.

QUINCE

Confused, huh?  About what?

JOE

Love.

QUINCE

'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles

of my own.

JOE

You love Allison, don't you?

QUINCE

Oh yes, I do.

JOE

How did you meet?

QUINCE

I was a world-class loser and she

was a happy, little rich girl --

and for some reason she took me in.

JOE

But she loves you?

JOE (cont'd)

How do you know?

QUINCE

Because there's nothing we don't

know about each other and it's okay.

I mean the deeper, darkest secrets

-- they don't matter.

JOE

'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?

QUINCE

Yeah, it's like you know every inch

of each other's souls -- and then

you're free.

JOE

What do you mean 'free'?

QUINCE

Free to love each other.  Com-

pletely.  Totally.  No fear.

QUINCE (cont'd)

All that hoopla up there reminds me

how I will never measure up to a man

like Bill Parrish - or his daughter.

QUINCE (cont'd)

Do you like me, Joe?

JOE

Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.

QUINCE

What would you say if you knew

it was me who brought down Bill

Parrish?

(a moment)

I told Drew and the Board that Bill

depended on you.  Drew led me on,

but I had no business telling him

in the first place.  He was setting

up Bill from day one.  Drew and

Bontecou are going to chop up the

company and sell it off for parts.

Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr.

Inside.  And I was the fool who made

it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?

JOE

Go to Bill Parrish and tell him

everything.  He'll forgive you.

QUINCE

You think so?  How do you know?

JOE

Because that's the kind of man Bill

Parrish is.

QUINCE

Well, maybe... I guess you know him

better than anybody.

JOE

-- Getting to.

QUINCE

Do you think I should wait to tell

him 'till after the party?

JOE

No.

SUSAN

I like you in a black tie.

JOE

I love you in an evening gown.

SUSAN

It beats a surgical, doesn't it?

SUSAN (cont'd)

Daddy told me you might be leaving?

JOE

Yes.  Your father and I, our time

together has come to an end.

SUSAN

Where are you going?

SUSAN (cont'd)

You won't tell me?

JOE

Well -- I --

SUSAN

And you can't tell me who you are.

SUSAN (cont'd)

I'm in love with a man, I don't know

who he is, where he's going or when.

JOE

I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.

SUSAN

It gets worse.

JOE

No worse than it gets for me.  I'm

in love with a woman whom I don't

want to leave.

SUSAN

Then don't.

JOE

We know so little about each

other --

SUSAN

We know all that we need to know --

JOE

But there's so much to tell you --

SUSAN

Don't.  That will come later.

JOE

Will it?

SUSAN

Lightning struck.  We caught it in

a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want

to be with you, Joe --

JOE

What will we do?

SUSAN

'Love will find out the way'.

JOE

'Love will find out the way'?

SUSAN

It's a saying.

JOE

I believe that, don't you?

SUSAN

Yes, that's why I said it.

ALLISON (O.S.)

There you are!

ALLISON (cont'd)

What's going on here?  Tete-a-tetes

on my big night?

(to Susan)

C'mon honey, you're needed.

(to Joe)

Can it wait?

ALLISON (cont'd)

Glad to hear it!

(to Susan)

Let's go.

QUINCE

...what can I say after I say that

I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've

zagged, I opened my big mouth one

too many times, everything got all

twisted --

PARRISH

It's okay, Quince.  I understand.

You've always meant well and I

appreciate that.  Sometimes things

just turn out -- wrong.

JOE

Excuse me --

QUINCE

Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you

-- okay, Bill?

PARRISH

Sure.

QUINCE

(to Parrish)

Joe knew the whole story.  I told

him.  It was his idea that I come

clean.  I mean I wanted to come

clean but he gave me a pair of

balls, you know what I mean?

PARRISH

Yes, I believe I do.

QUICHE

Yeah, well -- I can tell you guys

got business --

PARRISH

No, I'm out of business, right,

Quince?  However I do have some

unfinished business -- with Drew.

Get him out here.  Get him on the

chopper and get him out here to-

night.  I want to tell this guy

how I feel about him face-to-face.

QUINCE

Oh, that could be a tall order, B.P.

I doubt that Drew's anxious to see

you face-to-face.

JOE

(to Quince)

Tell Drew that Bill acknowledges

that this was a contest and he's

lost.  The race is to the swift,

but could Drew summon a modicum

of understanding and allow Bill to

save face.  Tell him Bill wants it

understood in the business community

he has merely moved upstairs in his

own company, and the executive

continuity is unbroken.  Tonight's

the night to do it.  He'll introduce

Drew to his press friends as well as

some of his close acquaintances from

Washington and Drew can tell them

that everything's sailing along just

fine.

PARRISH

(to Quince)

All in all, what Bill wants to do is

build the golden bridge to Drew with

no hard feelings.

QUINCE

You think Drew will go for it?

PARRISH

Quince, I've got confidence in you.

QUINCE

Sir, I'll deliver the package.

PARRISH

Thanks.

JOE

Not at all.

JOE (cont'd)

How are you doing?

PARRISH

What the hell do you care?

JOE

I was just asking, Bill.

PARRISH

You 'want to know', I'll tell you.

You're looking at a man who tonight

is not about to walk through the

Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's

galloping into it.  And the same time,

the business he built with his own

hands and his own head is being

commandeered by a couple of cheap

pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost

forgot, my daughter's fallen in

love with Death.

JOE

-- And I'm in love with your

daughter.

PARRISH

Say again?

JOE

I'm in love with your daughter, and

I'm taking her with me tonight.

PARRISH

You're what?

JOE

I think you heard me, Bill.

PARRISH

You're not taking Susan anywhere.

And what the hell does that mean

anyway?

PARRISH (cont'd)

I thought we had a deal.

JOE

I'm sorry, Bill --

PARRISH

Susan is my daughter, she has a

wonderful life ahead of her and

you're going to deprive her of

it and you're telling me you're

sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology

not accepted.

JOE

I love her, Bill.  She is all that

I ever wanted, and I've never wanted

for anything because I've never

wanted anything before, if you can

understand.

PARRISH

How perfect for you -- to take

whatever you want because it

pleases you.  It's not love --

JOE

Then what is it?

PARRISH

Some aimless infatuation in which,

for the moment, you feel like in-

dulging.  It's missing everything

that matters.

JOE

Which is what?

PARRISH

Trust, responsibility, taking the

weight, for your choices and feel-

ings and spending the rest of your

life living up to them.  And above

all, not hurting the object of your

love.

JOE

So that's what love is?

PARRISH

Multiply it by infinity and take it

to the death of forever and you will

still have barely a glimpse of what

I am talking about.

JOE

Those were my words, Bill.

PARRISH

Well, they're mine now.

JOE

Susan wants to come.  She says she's

in love with me.

PARRISH

With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you

tell her who you are?

JOE

No.

PARRISH

Does she know where she's going?

PARRISH (cont'd)

Susan went, in whatever way she did,

for that poor sonofabitch whose body

you took, and everything else since

has been aftermath.  You say you love

her but you don't know what love is.

She 'loves' you but she doesn't know

who you are.  You make a deal, you're

breaking it -- the bottom line is,

Joe, you're conducting a Great

Romance under false pretenses.

JOE

I don't like what you're saying.

PARRISH

I don't expect you to.

JOE

Are you threatening me?

PARRISH

I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan

from the moment she was born, and I

love her now, and every minute in

between, and what I dream of is a

man who will discover her and she

will discover a man who will love

her, who is worthy of her, who is of

this world, of this time and has the

grace and compassion and fortitude

to walk beside her as she makes her

way through this beautiful thing

called life.

JOE

Are you telling me I can't be

part of it?

PARRISH

Why did you come in here and tell

me, Joe?  You are the Biggest Shot

of all, you don't have to ask my

permission, but that's what you're

doing.  You know why?  Because you've

somewhere, somehow, developed into a

good guy, and you know this is all

wrong... I don't know what you're

going to do -- how can this be love?

She doesn't know who you are.  Why

don't you tell her?  Try it out on

her?  See what happens.  Reveal

everything there is to know about

yourself and let the chips fall

where they may.

PARRISH (cont'd)

Okay? -- I've given it my best shot.

I wish I could tell you to sleep on

it but...

SUSAN

Hello, Joe.  What'd you know?

SUSAN (cont'd)

There's something so indescribably

sexy about you in a crowd.  I could

make love to you right here.

SUSAN (cont'd)

If you're going to tell my future,

you're on the wrong side.

JOE

There is something I do want to tell

you --

SUSAN

But you can't.

SUSAN (cont'd)

Just then -- when you hesitated --

the way you shift from foot-to-foot,

I've always found endearing but just

now -- I got a chill.

SUSAN (cont'd)

Remember that morning in the coffee

shop?  You said 'What's wrong with

taking care of a woman, she takes

care of you --"

JOE

Did I say that?

SUSAN

And I said you'd have a hard time

finding a woman like that.

SUSAN (cont'd)

Well, you've found one, Joe.

JOE

The 'coffee shop' --

SUSAN

-- That was the place... and you were

the guy.

SUSAN (cont'd)

And you said you didn't want me to

be your doctor because you didn't

want me to examine you --?

(a moment)

Well, I got to examine you after

all --

SUSAN (cont'd)

I could come with you --

JOE

I - uh --

SUSAN

You want me to wait for you, you'll

be back --

SUSAN (cont'd)

Why do I want this night to last

forever?

JOE

Don't you know, that's what I want

more than anything.

SUSAN

You said before you couldn't tell me

who or where, only the 'when' -- Is

when now?

JOE

May I kiss you?

SUSAN

That felt like a goodbye.

SUSAN (cont'd)

What's going on, Joe?  I feel like

we're lifting off --

JOE

I'm still here.

SUSAN

But you're not.  You're somewhere

else.

(a moment)

You're someone else --

SUSAN

Tell me you love me -- tell me

you love me now --

JOE

I love you now, I'll love you

always --

SUSAN

Hold me --

JOE

Susan --

SUSAN

-- Yes?

JOE

Thank you for loving me.

JOE

...We should think about getting

started, Bill.

JOE (cont'd)

It'll just be us.

PARRISH

Thank you.

QUINCE (O.S.)

Bill --?

PARRISH

Come in.

QUINCE

-- I got him.  The chopper's two

minutes away.

PARRISH

(to Joe)

How are we on time?

JOE

Okay.

PARRISH

(to Quince)

Get him in here.

PARRISH (cont'd)

...May? -- I know you're busy,  but I

want you to put in a call to Eddie

Sloane for me --

MAY (O.S.)

At home, sir --?

PARRISH

No, he's at the office.

DREW

This is damn big of Bill, I also

think it's smart.

QUINCE

He had no choice.  You're a

formidable adversary.

DREW

He said that?

QUINCE

Well, you've got him by the short-

hairs.

DREW

Yeah, the short, gray hairs.

SLOANE (O.S.)

(speakerphone)

We're all here, Bill --

PARRISH

I appreciate this, Eddie, members

of the Board, this will just take a

minute of your time.  As the custo-

dians of the company, you may re-

ceive information from what follows

that is valuable to you --

(a moment)

-- or not.  Either way, thanks.

SLOANE (O.S.)

(speakerphone)

We're all ears.

DREW

Hi, Bill, happy birthday --

DREW (cont'd)

I just wanted to say how appre-

ciative I am of this - uh - grand

gesture and --

PARRISH

Shut up and sit down.

PARRISH (cont'd)

You're a worthless sack of shit, you

fucked me over, played footsie with

John Bontecou, sold my company out

to line your own pockets.

DREW

I don't know where you get that idea

-- the Board agreed --

PARRISH

The Board didn't know you're a mole

who burrowed inside so you could bury

us all.

DREW

Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another

one of his whoppers?  Aren't you

sick of this asshole lurking around?

No one knows who he is, but one

thing everyone does know, he somehow

got your ear and has been pouring

poison into it ever since.

JOE

You're the poison, Drew.  You've

operated behind-the-scenes to suborn

the trust of a man who has stamped

you with his imprimatur of class and

elegance and stature.  I've seen all

kinds and degrees of deception in my

time, but Bill Parrish has been on

the receiving end of machinations so

Machiavellian that it has rarely

been my experience to encounter.  And

yet he has combatted them stoically,

and selflessly, without revealing my

identity.  Had he violated the vow

of secrecy he took, his task would

have been far easier, he could have

turned defeat into victory, but he

is too honorable a man to have done

that.  And now I must release him

from that vow.  Because of me, he

has lost his work, his company, his

reputation -- and now he's going to

tell you who I am.

DREW

(to Parrish)

So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in

my pants.

JOE

-- And now you're going to pee some

more.

PARRISH

Joe, don't do this --

JOE

It's time to put this person where

he belongs.

PARRISH

It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's

going to step aside --

DREW

I'm not stepping anywhere --

JOE

I appreciate your gentlemanliness,

Bill, but what we need to do here is

drive the dagger home --

DREW

The dagger --?

PARRISH

I told you to shut up.

JOE

(to Drew)

Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --

PARRISH

He is --

JOE

I'll take it from here --

(to Drew)

I am --

PARRISH

-- An IRS man.

PARRISH (cont'd)

Yes, he is.  He's an -- IRS man.

Aren't you, Joe?

JOE

Yes, I am.

(to Drew)

IRS man.

PARRISH

The Treasury Department asked

my cooperation in his undercover

investigation of John Bontecou.

They were convinced that Bontecou,

on past deals, had structured his

mergers and acquisitions in sus-

picious and complicated ways so as

to evade paying the taxes he is

liable for.  The IRS wanted to go

after him, and this deal offered

them the opportunity.

(a moment)

I agreed to cooperate.

JOE

(to Parrish)

And we're very grateful.

PARRISH

Moreover, Agent Joe Black here --

of course that's not his real name

-- smelled out your involvement,

Drew.  He developed evidence you

were working both sides of the

fence.  Unfortunately, that's known

as a conflict of interest --

JOE

Undisclosed conflict of interest --

PARRISH

An offense --

JOE

An indictable offense.

DREW

I think I'd like to talk to my

lawyer --

PARRISH

No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to

offer you a deal.

PARRISH (cont'd)

Confess to the Board every details of

your participation and then submit

your resignation.

DREW

And what do I get?

PARRISH

You get not to go to jail.

DREW

You're talking through your hat.

You're offering a deal because

you've got no proof.

PARRISH

Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.

JOE

(to Drew)

And he's talking through his lips.

JOE (cont'd)

Make no mistake, Drew, if you choose

to test my resolve in this matter,

you'll be looking at an outcome that

will have a finality that is beyond

your comprehension, and you'll not

be counting the days or the months

or the years, but millenniums in the

house with no doors.

DREW

All right, you win.  As soon as I

get back to the city, I'll meet with

the Board.

SLOANE (O.S.)

You're meeting with the Board right

now, Drew.  Resignation accepted.

Moreover, I propose a motion to re-

confirm William Parrish as Chairman

of the Board of Parrish Communica-

tions as well as a rejection of the

merger with Bontecou International.

How say you, Board?

SLOANE (O.S., cont'd)

The motion is passed.

PARRISH

Well, thank you, that's great, but

it's more than I bargained for.  I

just wanted to set the record

straight.

SLOANE (O.S.)

But we want you back, Bill.  Mean-

while, enjoy your party, celebrate,

we'll attend to the nasty details.

And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.

JOE

My pleasure.  This is an IRS Agent's

dream.  I'll be promoted to Chief of

Section off of this.

DREW

Who would've ever believed it?  You,

an IRS Agent --

JOE

'Death and Taxes'.

ALLISON

Daddy!  We've been looking all over

for you - this is your party - what

are you doing in here?  Never mind.

You're on.  Let's go.

PARRISH

(to the guests)

I thought I was going to sneak away

tonight...

PARRISH (cont'd)

...What a glorious night, every

face I see is a memory.  It may not

be a perfectly perfect memory --

sometimes we had our ups and downs

-- but we're all together, and

you're mine for a night.

(a moment)

-- And I'm going to break precedent,

and tell you my one-candle wish --

that you would have a life as lucky

as mine, where you can wake up one

morning and say "I don't want

anything more."

(another moment)

Sixty-five years - don't they go by

in a blink?

SUSAN

What a night.

PARRISH

I'm having a helluva time.

SUSAN

You were right about Joe, he is

going somewhere --

PARRISH

(gently)

I'm sorry.

SUSAN

Are you relieved?

PARRISH

Yes, but --

SUSAN

But what?

PARRISH

I want you to know how much I love

you.  That you've given a meaning

to my life that I had no right to

expect, and that no one can ever

take from me.

SUSAN

Daddy --

PARRISH

No -- I love you so much and I want

you to promise me something.  I

don't want you to ever worry about

me.  If anything should happen, I'm

going to be fine and everything's

going to be all right.

(a moment)

-- And I have no regrets.

PARRISH (cont'd)

And I want you to feel that way,

too.

SUSAN

I love you, Daddy --

PARRISH

That's why it's okay.

PARRISH (cont'd)

No regrets?

SUSAN

'No regrets'.

PARRISH

It's a good feeling, isn't it?

SUSAN

Everybody's saying goodbye...

PARRISH

I'm still here.

(a moment)

Would you like to dance with me,

Susan?

SUSAN

Oh, yes --

PARRISH

If you don't mind dancing with an

old fogey like me.

SUSAN

Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll

never be old.

WAITER

Can I get you anything, sir?

JOE

Do you have any peanut butter?

WAITER

I don't think so, sir.

JOE

Thank you, anyway.

PARRISH

What was that?

SUSAN

The fireworks are about to start.

SUSAN (cont'd)

(to Parrish)

Shall we?

PARRISH

You go ahead, honey, I'm going to

catch my breath.

JOE

Happy Birthday, Bill.

PARRISH

Thank you.

PARRISH (cont'd)

Did you say goodbye?

JOE

Not exactly.

PARRISH

I guess you have your reasons.

JOE

Yes.

PARRISH

Now that we have a moment, would you

mind if I expressed my gratitude for

what you did for Susan?

PARRISH (cont'd)

I never heard her speak of any man

as she spoke of you -- It was always

what I wanted for her -- but what

happens to her now?

JOE

I wouldn't worry about it, Bill.

These things have a way of working

out.

JOE (cont'd)

And would you mind if I expressed my

gratitude...?

JOE (cont'd)

For you.  For the time you've given

me.  For the person you are.

PARRISH

Don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll

ruin my autopsy.

PARRISH (cont'd)

It's hard to let go, isn't it?

JOE

Yes.

PARRISH

That's life.  What can I tell you?

PARRISH

I'm getting a little dizzy, I can

feel my heart pumping --

PARRISH (cont'd)

Should I be afraid?

JOE

Not a man like you.

SUSAN

Joe...?

SUSAN (cont'd)

You're here...

JOE

-- You bet.

SUSAN

Where did you go?

JOE

I don't know -- y'know, I don't know

-- it's all blurred up and hazy.  And

would y'know what I mean if I said I

don't think it's worth figuring out?

JOE (cont'd)

...But now I'm back.

SUSAN

(gently)

That's it?

JOE

Well, I don't know what else to say.

It's a helluva party --

SUSAN

You think so?

JOE

Yeah...and you're the prettier

thing here.

YOUNG MAN

Hey, you all right?

SUSAN

The coffee shop --

YOUNG MAN

I asked you if I said something

wrong and you said it was so right

it scared you.

YOUNG MAN (cont'd)

And forgive me for saying this --

but then you said -- and it's been

with me ever since --

SUSAN

What has --?

YOUNG MAN

You said you liked me.

SUSAN

No --

YOUNG MAN

Y'didn't?

SUSAN

I said I liked you so much.

YOUNG MAN

Hey, everything's going great --

don't y'think?

YOUNG MAN (cont'd)

Don't you feel that way?

SUSAN

...We know so little about each

other.

YOUNG MAN

But we've got time.

SUSAN

I wish you could've known my

father...

YOUNG MAN

Me, too.

SUSAN

...What do we do now?

YOUNG MAN

It will come to us.
