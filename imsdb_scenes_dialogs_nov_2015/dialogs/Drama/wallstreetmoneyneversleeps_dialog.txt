WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS

Written by

Allan Loeb

JACOB (V.O.)

It's funny, the more we find ourselves

slaves of chance... the more

superstitious we become.

2.

JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And that would make Andrew Zabel one

superstitious motherfucker.

JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

He started every day the same exact

way. He would walk his dogs then

leave his Gramercy Park condo at seven

am on the dot.

JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And he would take an umbrella with him

even when there was no chance of

rain...

JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

He'd buy a journal, a tin of chocolate

Altoids and a cold bottle of Poland

Springs water.

JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

He had timed it out so he wouldn't

have to wait more than three minutes

for the uptown five train.

JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I guess you could say that day was

like every other...

JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Except for one thing...

3.

DARKNESS

A CHART

MIDTOWN

ZABEL

Go ahead, open it.

JACOB

Really?

4.

JACOB (CONT'D)

I thought that because of the problems

with the credi--

ZABEL

Screw the credit derivative desk, I

don't understand half the shit they do

anyway.

JACOB

Are you okay?

ZABEL

Open it.

JACOB

Thank you.

ZABEL

I'm proud of you, Jacob.

SALESMAN (V.O.)

Princess cut, platinum banded, five

carat, completely colorless round

center stone with a medium girdle and

excellent polish.

JACOB

Yeah, it's nice. But here's the

thing...

5.

JACOB (CONT'D)

I want to see the "fuck you" room.

SALESMAN

The "fuck you" room?

JACOB

Yes. The room where you sell me a

fuck you ring for fuck you money.

SALESMAN

The private client foyer.

JACOB

What did I say?

CODY WILLARD (ON TV)

Tomorrow night we explore the excesses

of hedge fund managers.

CODY WILLARD (ON TV) (CONT'D)

Whether they're spraying $5000 a

bottle champagne at Voile Rouge in

Saint-Tropez, ordering a $10,000

Martini at The Algonquian Hotel with a

diamond on the bottom or eating a gold

dusted $175 hamburger at the Wall

Street Burger Shoppe...

CODY WILLARD (ON TV) (CONT'D)

... these cowboys of finance always

seem to land on their feet.

6.

JACOB

(INTO PHONE)

I know you're at the fund raiser

tonight but I wanted to say hi.

(BEAT)

Okay, best part... getting my bonus

check. Worst part...

JACOB (CONT'D)

(INTO PHONE)

... it was right after I ordered lunch

and I remembered that we're not seeing

each other this weekend.

JACOB (CONT'D)

(INTO PHONE)

Okay, text me yours and I'll read them

in my sleep. I love you.

WILLY

Jake, Glass Works is up nine points on

earnings, you want to unload some?

7.

JACOB

Yeah, let's get closer to home.

AUDRY

(to Jacob, re Willy)

Where's his hat?

WILLY

Mind your own business, Audry.

AUDRY

I had to wear Pfizer on my forehead

for a full week... so post it up,

bitch.

WILLY

C'mon Jake, it's embarrassing.

JACOB

The stock goes down, you wear the

crown... them's the rules.

8.

QUANT ANALYST

Girl like that cost a thousand bucks

last year... now it's up to five.

JACOB

Getting priced out of the hooker

bubble?

QUANT ANALYST

Goddamn bull market's killing my sex

life.

HEDGE FUND PM

Don't worry... it's not such a bull

market anymore. She'll be trading at

five hundred soon enough.

DERIVATIVES TRADER

(turning to Jacob)

It's true. I'm actually shocked KZI

gave you a bonus of that size.

JACOB

Why?

HEDGE FUND PM

(DISMISSIVE)

Yeah, I'm going long Boeing.

PRIVATE EQUITY CFO

Oh, I didn't notice.

QUANT ANALYST

Really? The 787 is having problems.

JACOB

(to Derivatives Trader)

Why? Why are you so shocked?

HEDGE FUND PM

Because they're in serious trouble.

9.

JACOB

We're not in serious trouble.

It's a rumor.

DERIVATIVES TRADER

I think Goodyear Tire is definitely a

buy.

HEDGE FUND PM

Totally. And those tires are real.

QUANT ANALYST

Goodyear? The chart is horrible.

PRIVATE EQUITY CFO

Somebody color the quant in here.

HEDGE FUND PM

Boeing, ticker BA... Big Ass.

Goodyear, ticker GT... Great Tits.

QUANT ANALYST

(realizing...)

Oh, it's like a code.

QUANT ANALYST (CONT'D)

You guys were down three points in an

up market today.

JACOB

Whatever, somebody was adding to their

short.

HEDGE FUND PM DERIVATIVES TRADER

QUANT ANALYST

(figuring it out)

Starwood, ticker HOT. Yeah but... I'm

more a buyer of...

(thinks for a minute)

GDFS.

PRIVATE EQUITY CFO

What the fuck is that?

10.

QUANT ANALYST

It's an exchange traded fund that

tracks the Guinian Franc.

HEDGE FUND PM

Okay, whatever -- what's it code for?

QUANT ANALYST

Gold Digger Freak Show.

JACOB

Can I ask you something, Robby?

JACOB (CONT'D)

What's your number?

ROBBY

Huh?

JACOB

You know what I mean. The amount of

money you would need to fuck it all

and walk away... if you wanted to.

ROBBY

Do you want to walk away?

JACOB

Not now. But one day... I don't know.

When I have a family. It's just so

consuming... so many marriages get

FUCKED UP--

ROBBY

Wall Street divorce lawyers do great

in any market.

JACOB

Exactly.

(BEAT)

I've thought about it. What I would

need... to raise a family, live a good

life, be secure. It's not as much as

we would think if you move out of New

York.

11.

ROBBY

Aha... when did you buy the ring?

JACOB

Last week.

ROBBY

So when are you going to ask her?

JACOB

I'm going to DC this weekend.

ROBBY

Good. I like her for you. She's one

of the good ones...

(BEAT)

Did you hear what her father said on

Charlie Rose?

ROBBY (CONT'D)

Something about Bear Stearns being the

first rain drop of the impending

mother of all storms.

JACOB

Sour grapes.

ROBBY

He's speaking at Columbia on Friday.

If it's slow enough, a few of us might

play hookie and check it out... he's

the best show in town.

JACOB

Tell me what you hear.

ROBBY

I don't think you want to hear it,

bro. You worship Zabel and it's not

good.

JACOB

I don't worship him. He's done a lot

for me and I've known him a long time.

But he's been acting strange lately.

(BEAT)

Just tell me what you hear.

ROBBY

That Keller Zabel is holding toxic

waste they can't find a market for.

12.

JACOB

It's not true. It's rumors. There

are hedge funds with huge short

positions...

ROBBY

Jacob, you know better. You know it

doesn't matter if they're rumors or

not.

ROBBY (CONT'D)

Senior year I couldn't get my mind

around how all those dot coms with no

earnings were worth billions of

dollars and you were the one who said

something that made it all clear for

me.

JACOB

I don't remember.

ROBBY

"An asset's value can only be priced

at its perception."

JACOB

I said that?

ROBBY

So buddy -- it don't matter if the

rumors are true or not. Because in

this climate... if they exist at

all... then most likely...

ROBBY (CONT'D)

... you're going to cease to.

DIEGO

J to the Acob -- morning to you,

brother.

JACOB

Diego...

13.

DIEGO

Okay, what's the best aphrodisiac on

Wall Street?

JACOB

I don't know.

DIEGO

Jet fuel.

JACOB

I'm here to see Andrew Zabel.

DOORMAN

Is he expecting you?

JACOB

No.

ZABEL

Jacob...

JACOB

Andy. I'm sorry to come by like this

but the rumors are now hitting a fever

pitch and I wanted to make sure

everything was okay.

ZABEL

Come on...

14.

JACOB

Is everything okay?

ZABEL

I remember when the starter gave me

this bushy hair twelve year old kid

and I said; "Donny, what the fuck --

give me a real caddy." And he said;

"This kid's the best."

JACOB

ANDY--

ZABEL

And you were. You had the wind down,

the grade of every green.

JACOB

What's going on?

ZABEL

But you wouldn't shut up about stocks.

Twelve years old and you blabbed on

and on about companies and sectors and

earnings.

JACOB

Andy, are we going under?

ZABEL

What was that piece of shit you loved?

That airline equipment supplier who

was branching out into car airbags--

JACOB

Flour Controls. Are you okay?

ZABEL

Flour Controls... what a dog.

JACOB

Why did you give me that bonus?

ZABEL

Because I know you, Jacob. And I know

you've been holding off because you

didn't think you had enough. We all

do that... postpone life until we

believe we have what it takes to

actually live it.

15.

JACOB

There isn't a better money-runner on

the street... we'll get through this.

ZABEL

Marry her, Jacob. And have children

with her and spend as much time as you

can with them... and never forget that

that's what's important.

JACOB

Andrew, if there's anyway I can help --

give back the bonus -- whatever... all

you have to do is say the word.

ZABEL

There's just so much you don't know,

Jacob.

ALEXIS GLICK (ON THE TVS)

Rumors of insolvency have hit the

street concerning KZI's books and

they're shooting first then asking

questions later. The stock is now

trading just a bit over thirty one

dollars a share, down almost forty

four percent on the session.

JACOB

JACOB

Who did this to us?

16.

JACOB

Andrew, call me back. I'm going to

find out who did this to us. I swear

to God... if it's the last thing I do.

(BEAT)

We're going to bounce back from this.

And we're going to find out who spread

the rumor... and then we're going to

destroy them.

GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE)

I don't know anything about the

solvency of Keller Zabel. I do know

that what's bringing down the stock at

this precise moment are rumors. And

this practice of short selling

American financial institutions then

floating rumors in order to profit

from them must be stopped. The uptick

rule must be reinstated.

GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE) (CONT'D)

And once again, I will point to

largely unregulated world of hedge

funds... an ever-growing and

increasing powerful area of the market

that I repeatedly tried to regulate as

Chairman of the SEC...

GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE) (CONT'D)

And the collapse of this legendary New

York financial institution is why I

continue to fight that battle as

Governor of this great state.

JACOB

What?

17.

ROBBY

(SHOUTING)

Jacob... answer the door.

ROBBY (CONT'D)

You weren't answering your phone.

JACOB

It broke.

ROBBY

Dude...

JACOB

What?

ROBBY

I just found this out and it hasn't

hit the press yet.

JACOB

What? Robby, what are you trying to

say?

ROBBY

Andrew Zabel threw himself in front of

the subway this morning.

18.

PROFESSOR

Our speaker today has quite a

checkered background in the world of

finance.

PROFESSOR (CONT'D)

He graduated from City College in 1966

and became a securities broker at

Hudson River Bank then moved on to

Smith Barney. In 1973 he went out on

his own to establish a spectacular

career as a independent trader then an

active participant in the LBO craze of

the 1980s.

(BEAT)

In 1988, he was indicted for insider

trading and then charged with other

various forms of securities fraud and

IRS violations. In one of the most

harshest sentences ever given to a

white collar criminal... he served

fourteen years in a maximum security

prison and he wants me to stress that

it was not a country club.

PROFESSOR (CONT'D)

Since his release in 2002, he has

written and has spoken publicly about

what he refers to as the current state

of the world economy. He is not

allowed to trade on the US exchanges.

His new book "Moral Hazard! Why Wall

Street Has Finally Gone Too Far."

comes out in October.

(BEAT)

Please welcome... Gordon Gekko!

GORDON GEKKO

19.

GORDON GEKKO

You're all pretty much fucked.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

What's not funny is what's happening

out there. I don't think people get

it. And I know the financial center

of the world doesn't get it... which

happens to be Washington DC now.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

To understand where we are, we need to

understand how we got here. No good

deed goes unpunished, all fires start

with a well meaning spark and we

wanted Americans to be able to afford

homes. Sounds nice enough... lets try

to get the middle and lower classes

into homes they can own. So we made

money cheap and lowered restrictions

on mortgage lending.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Somebody reminded me the other night

that I once said "greed is good." I

swear I don't remember it but it

sounds like something I would say in

the Eighties.

(BEAT)

And I was right then. Greed was good.

America needed greed and risk-taking

and leverage to get to become the

superpower we are... or were. And

capitalism needed greed and risk and

leverage to become the economic

platform it has become... but those

same attributes that got us there are

now the liabilities that threaten to

destroy us.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

So greed has been redefined. Who

knows -- maybe it was always like this

and like everything else in this

world, it's good and it is evil.

20.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Because people -- it's greed that

caused someone who aspires to own a

seven-hundred thousand dollar house

they can't afford, to take on a loan

they'll never be able to pay back...

and it's greed that caused their

mortgage lender to give them that loan

then sell it right away... and it's

greed that caused the buyer of that

loan to slice it into a million little

pieces then spit them all over the

world... and it's greed that caused

the rating agency to give that toxic

loan a triple-A rating just because it

was mixed in with some good loans...

and it's greed that caused the

insurance company to insure that loan.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

They were insuring the end of the

world; "When the world explodes...

just find us in the rubble and we'll

be sure to pay your claim."

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

CMO's, CLO's, CBO's, CDO's, CDS's,

SPE's, ABCP's,SIV's, REMIC's, CMBS's,

toxic traunches, ninja loans, credit

default swaps, affinity marketing,

stapled financing, synthetic

securitization.

(BEAT)

Maybe I was in prison too long but I

have no idea what half that shit

means.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

And I'm considered a pretty smart guy

when it comes to finance!

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

And if I know our central bank --

which I do -- I predict it's going to

throw gasoline on this fire with more

cheap money and federal bailouts and

HEAD-IN-THE-SAND MANIPULATED

statistics on productivity and

inflation.

21.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

So no good deed goes unpunished and

all fires start with a well-meaning

spark and when you take free money and

no lending standards then add it with

unaccountable risk and ungodly

leverage and unbridled greed... what

you end up with is cancer.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Systemic, malignant and global.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Do they still have the V&T restaurant

on Amsterdam? Is that still there?

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

(with a smile)

God, I loved their pizza.

GORDON GEKKO

(announcing to the throng)

I'll give you six minutes then I

really have to go.

JACOB

Mr. Gekko, can I speak to you for a

moment?

GORDON GEKKO

You're too late, Sport... Q&A's over.

JACOB

My name is Jacob Moore and I'm dating

your daughter.

(AND THEN)

I'm going to ask her to marry me.

22.

GORDON GEKKO

I'll give you nine minutes.

GORDON GEKKO

Keller, Zabel? Then you have my

apologies.

JACOB

Yeah...

GORDON GEKKO

Stock's in a free fall. My guess is

that it just lost its Bar Mitzvah...

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

By the end of the day it might not

even be potty trained.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

I might not be allowed to trade, Jake,

but I still love to watch from home.

JACOB

Andrew Zabel took me under his wing

when I was in high school. He

basically got me my scholarship to

Yale then hired me right out of

business school.

GORDON GEKKO

Andrew's smart, he beats the

benchmarks consistently. He'll land

on his feet.

JACOB

He's dead.

JACOB (CONT'D)

He killed himself this morning.

GORDON GEKKO

I'm sorry to hear that.

JACOB

He was a father to me.

23.

JACOB (CONT'D)

I love your daughter very much and I

would be honored if...

JACOB (CONT'D)

... you would bless-- I really don't

understand what you find so funny.

GORDON GEKKO

My daughter hasn't spoken to me for

eleven years and you know it. She

blames me for her brother's overdose

and every other disaster that's fallen

upon the world since the mid-nineties.

(BEAT)

And by the way, isn't it strange that

Winnie would date a guy from the

street?

JACOB

What?

GORDON GEKKO

She hates me. And she hates Wall

Street and everything it represents...

so don't you find it curious that she

would fall in love with you?

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

So you want my blessing?

JACOB

Yes.

GORDON GEKKO

I guess I should know a little about

you first. Where did you grow up?

JACOB

Matinecock.

GORDON GEKKO

I'm impressed.

JACOB

It wasn't like that. I mean we didn't

have much money. My mother was a

tailor.

24.

GORDON GEKKO

And your father... what did he do?

JACOB

Disappear.

GORDON GEKKO

Clever.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

What are you looking for?

JACOB

Your town car.

GORDON GEKKO

Well, pal...

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

... then you're going to be looking

for quite awhile.

JACOB

(RE PICTURE)

Can I see that?

GORDON GEKKO

She was eight in that one. It was

taken in Egypt.

JACOB

Can I... have it?

(EXPLAINING)

She doesn't keep pictures from her

childhood.

25.

GORDON GEKKO

What do I get in return?

JACOB

You... wanna make a trade?

GORDON GEKKO

Yes. I'll give you this picture and

in return... I'd like a picture of

Winnie... taken recently... without

you in it.

JACOB

I don't have one on me.

GORDON GEKKO

Then I'll give you this one on margin.

PLATFORM

JACOB

I really did come to ask for your

blessing.

GORDON GEKKO

No, you didn't. Nice ring...

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

It's so typical.

(inside of an ironic laugh)

Levered to the hilt... and with the

ship going down...

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

... they still gave you a bonus.

GORDON GEKKO

Don't play me, Jake. You don't think

I can see it in your eyes? You don't

think I know that look?

(BEAT)

(MORE)

26.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

I know it by sight, Kid... because I

lived it for years. Christ, I can

even smell it on you.

JACOB

Smell what on me?

GORDON GEKKO

Revenge.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Some hedgehog said bad things about

your company. It caused the stock to

plummet and made those bad things

become true.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

The man you loved like a father threw

himself in front of the uptown five

this morning and you want to bring

that hedgehog to their knees.

JACOB

You knew he was dead?

GORDON GEKKO

Like I said -- I still love to watch

from home.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

So don't insult me by pretending to

ask for Winnifred's hand when what you

really want to know is who to bring

down to their knees and how to do it.

JACOB

I know who.

GORDON GEKKO

Really?

JACOB

It was either Nassim Tariq from the

Frontier Fund, Bretton Woods from

Locust or Karen Molina from ESL.

27.

GORDON GEKKO

Does Winnie even know you came to see

me?

JACOB

Well, not exactly.

(THEN)

But I'm going to tell her.

GORDON GEKKO

Not such a grand idea, Pal.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

See, I have a feeling you're going to

want to see me again. And if you tell

her we had this little pow-wow...

she's not going to let that happen.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Look, you seem like a smart kid.

(BEAT)

Walk away, dust off your resume and

get another job...

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

... but do it quick.

JACOB

I'm going to bring them down. Whoever

floated the rumor for a quick buck.

GORDON GEKKO

It's not worth it. It's a waste of

energy and time. See, Jacob, nobody

gets it... they never did.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

If there's one thing I learned in

prison it's that money is not the

prime commodity in our lives... time

is.

(BEAT)

And your nine minutes are up.

28.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

There are worse ways to go than

jumping in front of a train. For

instance, could you imagine taking

something for your diabetes...

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

.. and end up having it cause you to

die of acute pancreatitis?

PRIEST

Andrew didn't have children, so he

made all you -- all of us -- his

children.

(BEAT)

And to list Andrew Zabel's many

accomplishments would take me far too

long to enumerate, but if you just

look around you, you'll see those

accomplishments in the faces of the

many people gathered here today.

PRIEST (CONT'D)

The alumni of the Morris High School

class of 1997... who -- through the

adopt a grade program -- Andrew

pledged to pay the college educations

of every member who graduated and got

accepted into a University.

PRIEST (CONT'D)

The members of the Saint Helena

Symphony, who Andrew provided

emergency funding for when they were

facing extinction.

(BEAT)

And the many, many, other recipients

of Andrew Zabel's generosity.

PRIEST (CONT'D)

Those who were left behind... those

who were overlooked... those who

otherwise would never have stood a

chance.

29.

PRIEST (CONT'D)(O.S)

Above being just a great financial

mind... or a great husband...

PRIEST (CONT'D) (O.S.)

... or a great father... or a great

neighbor... or a great friend...

PRIEST (CONT'D) (O.S.)

... Andrew Zabel was a great man.

AUDRY

Two dollars a share?

WILLY

The Fed didn't give us a choice.

AUDRY

Does that include the building?

DANIEL

What about the Zabel's institutional

managed fund? How much is in that?

WILLY

Eight billion.

AUDRY

And that's all intact.

DANIEL

Jesus, United Bancorp made out like a

bandit.

WILLY

We could've handled it at $60 a share

or even $50.

WILLY (CONT'D)

It was that fucking rumor. It was so

well timed. And the market doesn't

care... shoot first, ask later.

30.

DANIEL

Lemmings.

AUDRY

(OMINOUSLY)

United has a huge trading desk.

DANIEL

Yeah, we're all out of a job.

JACOB

My mother was a tailor.

JACOB (CONT'D)

Out of our house less than five miles

from here.

AUDRY

You're from Matinecock? I thought you

didn't grow up with mon--

JACOB

We weren't rich. Everyone else was.

(BEAT)

She altered their clothes and I

carried their golf clubs.

JACOB (CONT'D)

He gave me a seat at the table.

BARBARA

Jacob...

BARBARA (CONT'D)

(through her sobs)

You were a son to him...

31.

JACOB

I was a fucked up kid, I was angry, my

mother couldn't control me. He was

the only one who cared. I wouldn't be

anywhere right now if it wasn't for...

JACOB (CONT'D)

If you need anything.

WINNIE

Jacob, I'm so sorry.

(BEAT)

Why didn't you tell me?

JACOB

Lehigh had the committee hearings and

I knew he would need you and I didn't

WANT TO--

WINNIE

That's not how this works.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

Jacob, that's not how this works.

JACOB

Will you marry me?

WINNIE

What?

JACOB

I got a ring. Not on me, but--

WINNIE

Are you proposing to me at a funeral?

JACOB

Yeah.

32.

JACOB (CONT'D)

I had a whole thing I was going to do

in DC but seeing you... the words just

kind of fell out of my mouth... I

don't know.

WINNIE

He would've loved you doing this here.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

Yes... I'll marry you, Jacob.

JACOB

By the way, I don't have a job

anymore.

WINNIE

Awesome.

JACOB'S APARTMENT

WINNIE (CONT'D)

It's beautiful.

JACOB

Yeah...

WINNIE

It's too expensive. We'll return it.

JACOB

No.

WINNIE

Jacob I don't care about what ring you

give me. You know that.

JACOB

We're not taking it back. I worked

hard for that ring and I want you to

wear it.

WINNIE

Okay.

33.

JACOB

Hey Audry.

JACOB (CONT'D)

You cover pharm and biotech.

AUDRY

I did.

JACOB

Who are the big players in diabetes

treatments?

AUDRY

Lilly, Abbot, OSI, Inverness.

JACOB

Is anyone riding on something in phase

three?

AUDRY

Few midcaps maybe. You want me to

check?

AUDRY (CONT'D)

Oh, this takes me back to when I had a

job...

AUDRY (CONT'D)

Yeah, Amlyn pharmaceuticals has Byetta

going in front of the FDA next month.

I remember this...

(MORE)

34.

AUDRY (CONT'D)

they pulled it during phase two

because some of the test subjects died

but they've obviously solved those

problems now.

JACOB

How did they die?

AUDRY

I don't remember.

JACOB

Pancreatitis?

AUDRY

Yeah. That was it.

JACOB

How did he know?

AUDRY

Who?

JACOB

Can you look up large institutional

ownership?

AUDRY

Mutual or hedge?

JACOB

Hedge.

AUDRY

Locust Fund owns a shitload.

AUDRY (CONT'D)

Bretton Woods.

JACOB

Want your severance, Audry?

JACOB (CONT'D)

HEDGE FUND PM

What the fuck is pancreatitis anyway?

JACOB

I don't know exactly but it's not

something you wanna come down with.

MORGAN PORTFOLIO MANAGER

(whispers to Jacob)

When's the FDA coming down with their

decision?

CHRISTIE'S

JACOB

Any day now.

EVOLUTION STUDIOS

BLOGGER

Where's your information from?

LOFT

JACOB

A doctor that's very close to the

trials... and that's all I can say.

CHRISTIES

36.

JACOB (CONT'D)

But listen, I'm out of work now so I

can't afford to get behind size on

this trade... I'm only telling you

because you've helped me in the past.

EVOLUTION STUDIOS

JACOB (CONT'D)

This is completely off the record. So

please...

LOFT

JACOB (CONT'D)

... don't tell anyone.

JACOB

Your boy's coming up in the polls.

SENATOR LEHIGH

They're blaming this mess on the

current administration... it's helping

us. And some people say that the

worst isn't over.

JACOB

Her father. What's the word he

uses... systemic.

WINNIE

When did he say that?

JACOB

On Charlie Rose.

37.

SENATOR LEHIGH

(with a smile)

Okay -- so when's the big date?

38.

JENNA LEE (ON TV)

... another stock that's getting

beaten before the bell is Amlyn

Pharmaceuticals. The stock's down

nine percent in premarket trading on

no news.

JENNA LEE (ON TV) (CONT'D)

When we come back we have Blue star

Airlines' CEO Bud Fox discussing how

he turned his once small regional

airline into the country's third

largest carrier.

WINNIE

If he wins... she has a real chance

for a cabinet position and I'm pretty

sure she'll take me with her if she

can.

JACOB

He's going to win.

WINNIE

Don't jinx it.

39.

ERIC BOLLING (ON THE TV)

Big drop in Amlyn as negative rumors

on the street forced the company to

admit there are still internal

concerns about Byetta and

pancreatitis. They now may be forced

to pull the phase three drug from FDA

review and retool.

(BEAT)

The stock takes a twenty-eight percent

haircut.

WINNIE

Can we watch something else?

JACOB

Whatever you want.

WINNIE

(KIDDING)

Project Runway.

JACOB

Not Project Runway.

WINNIE

Hello... who is this? Hold on.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

It's for you... someone named Bretton

Woods?

JACOB

I'm here to see Bretton Woods.

PARLOR

40.

BRETTON WOODS

As you can see, I'm having a little

dinner party here but I thought it was

important we speak right away.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Please... if you don't mind waiting in

my office, I'll be in a minute.

41.

BRETTON WOODS (O.S.)

Saturno devorando a sus hijos.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Saturn devouring his son. Francisco

Goya.

JACOB

Do you collect?

BRETTON WOODS

No.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Only the obsessive compulsive or the

insecure egotistical feel the need to

collect things.

JACOB

Your daughter's an amazing piano

player. That was quite a show.

BRETTON WOODS

That wasn't my daughter. That was

Isabel Patrovsky, she's the world's

greatest living piano prodigy.

(BEAT)

And that wasn't a show... that was a

very expensive private recital.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

You cost my fund three hundred and

forty million dollars today.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Yeah, kills my year, pushes my

watermark higher and might cause

redemptions.

(MORE)

42.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

(BEAT)

I hope you're happy. My fund's in

trouble now.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

You don't want to deny it?

JACOB

No.

BRETTON WOODS

Who told you?

JACOB

A doctor I know.

BRETTON WOODS

I checked with all the desks in

town... you didn't make money off it.

JACOB

That's right.

BRETTON WOODS

Then why did you do it?

JACOB

You destroyed my firm.

BRETTON WOODS

Your firm destroyed itself.

JACOB

You killed Andrew Zabel.

BRETTON WOODS

Andrew Zabel killed himself.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

The rumors were true.

JACOB

You made them true.

BRETTON WOODS

No, Jacob, being levered thirty-eight

to one in toxic debt made them true.

(BEAT)

Institutional money-running was

Zabel's talent... he didn't have a

down year in the last twenty.

43.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

His fatal flaw was allowing the

children on his mortgage security desk

to talk him into the deadly game of

hot potato everybody's been so fond of

playing recently.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Come work for me.

JACOB

What?

BRETTON WOODS

I run three billion dollars. Come

help me run it.

JACOB

Why me?

BRETTON WOODS

Because your loyalty desired revenge,

your balls actually attempted it and

your skills pulled it off.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

And as for Andrew Zabel... there

really is no telling why he did what

he did.

(BEAT)

As far as I'm concerned, it was just a

bit of money... and there are surely

more important things in the world.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Now I'm going on Safari with my

family. Think about the offer and get

in touch after the July 4th holiday.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

You got my attention, Jacob... and

that's one of the rarest commodities

out there.

44.

JACOB

You can have my answer now, Bretton...

I have no interest in working for a

fund that's in trouble.

BRETTON WOODS

Touche.

JACOB

What's your number?

BRETTON WOODS

Excuse me?

JACOB

The amount of money you would need to

be able to walk away from it all and

just live happily-ever-after.

(BEAT)

Everybody has one -- it's an exact

number -- what's yours?

BRETTON WOODS

More.

DIEGO

You know what I overheard a guy say

yesterday?

JACOB

I know you're going to tell me...

DIEGO

"This market's just like a divorce.

I've lost half my money... only I

still have my wife!"

JACOB

Not bad...

45.

GORDON GEKKO

There's a wait.

JACOB

Oh...

GORDON GEKKO

Fifteen minutes she said.

JACOB

Okay.

GORDON GEKKO

No, that's not okay. Because it means

they're crowded so every tier in the

service chain will be extended. The

sixteen minutes we would normally wait

to order will now be twenty six, the

standard twenty four minutes waiting

for our food to arrive will turn into

thirty nine, the eight minutes to get

the check will become seventeen and

the four minutes to process the credit

card will take nine.

(BEAT)

I told you I'd have lunch with you...

not give you a hundred and six minutes

of my time.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Let's go to Whole Foods.

GORDON GEKKO

Did you eat before?

JACOB

Just not hungry.

GORDON GEKKO

Yeah... I used to not eat lunch too.

46.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Fitting.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

That'll make it a round trade for us.

JACOB

I actually owe you one now.

JACOB (CONT'D)

I crushed him.

GORDON GEKKO

Did you?

JACOB

His fund is bleeding. I wouldn't be

surprised if the redemptions finish

the job.

GORDON GEKKO

Well, Chief... you seem awfully proud

of yourself.

JACOB

How'd you know about Amlyn?

GORDON GEKKO

It's amazing what information you can

find out when people know you're not

going to trade on it.

JACOB

So, you didn't use me to make a little

money?

GORDON GEKKO

Naw. I prefer to write about the

action now than be apart of it.

JACOB

Why'd you give it to me?

GORDON GEKKO

You're out of a job and most likely

going to marry my daughter... I

figured you could use the money.

JACOB

I didn't make any money off of it.

47.

GORDON GEKKO

You didn't trade it?

JACOB

That would've been insider trading,

Mr. Gekko.

JACOB (CONT'D)

And not "most likely."

(BEAT)

Winnie and I are engaged.

GORDON GEKKO

So did you take my advice and not tell

your new fiance about our little

friendship.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

So, I'm guessing she's not going to

take your last name.

JACOB

Good guess.

GORDON GEKKO

That's my Winnie. I knew she was a

feminist when she was five and furious

that Mrs. Claus didn't get enough

credit.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

My brother has two daughters. I had

Winnie and Rudy.

(sucking in a deep breath)

And since Rudy... you know... well,

I've worried about the name. It's

something you don't really think about

until you hit sixty or so but it's

important.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

I want you to get my daughter to

accept me back into her life again,

Jacob.

48.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Because save for the extremely

precious and depreciating asset of

time... she's all I have.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

C'mon, I'll show you some more

pictures of your fiancee that she

doesn't want you to see.

SLICK

Gordon...

SLICK (CONT'D)

Sky still falling?

GORDON GEKKO

You know it.

SLICK

(inside of a derisive sigh)

Sells books I guess.

GORDON GEKKO

She refused to take that cowboy hat

off. She actually slept in it.

49.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Tulip mania... the art of a bubble.

JACOB

Bretton offered to hire me.

GORDON GEKKO

And did you accept?

JACOB

Fuck no.

GORDON GEKKO

JP Morgan... he single-handedly

stopped the Panic of 1907 by stepping

in and buying up shares in all the

companies that were crashing.

Everyone else quickly followed like

lemmings.

(re political cartoon)

See -- people had stopped looking to

their government or trusted advisors.

They looked to JP Morgan. It was all

about simple psychology -- every crash

should have a JP Morgan to step in and

save it.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

See Jacob... the best opportunities

are found where angels fear to tread.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

That's a bond issued by the Central

American country of Poyais. Gregor

McGregor made a fortune dealing these

to the British elite in 1820.

(BEAT)

The country didn't exist.

50.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Weimer Republic of Germany 1922.

Inflation turned to hyper-inflation

and it was more efficient to burn the

money for heat than spend it.

JACOB

That's horrifying.

GORDON GEKKO

I know.

JACOB

What caused it?

GORDON GEKKO

A country in debt... that took on even

more debt to fund a war... then

printed mountains of money to avoid a

depression and other financial

imbalances...

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

... sound familiar?

JACOB

And you honestly think this is where

we're heading?

GORDON GEKKO

If we don't take our heads out of the

sand... yes. It's going to get bad

out there, Champ, I'm not going to

lie. Even the small regional bank I

started out at might go under.

JACOB

Hudson River Bank...

GORDON GEKKO

That's right.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

And I've got some news for you... he

ain't bleeding. He's not even cut.

JACOB

What are you talking about?

51.

GORDON GEKKO

What I'm talking about, Jake... is

that I'd bet dollars to donuts that

Bretton Woods unwound most of his

position in Amlyn last week. That he

knew about the pancreatitis.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

The only reason you think you hurt him

is because he wanted you to think

that.

JACOB

How do you know that?

GORDON GEKKO

I don't. But it's not Bretton's first

rodeo... and my instincts for this

sort of thing don't often disappoint.

JACOB

I can't believe it.

GORDON GEKKO

Believe it, Princess... he's beating

your ass all over the court.

JACOB

And you think I should take the job --

bring him down from the inside?

GORDON GEKKO

I don't know, Jake... what you kids

think is pay-back these days is really

incredible. When I was coming up, we

slaughtered men.

(BEAT)

There are guys still working at penny

ante brokerages in the Poughkeepsie's

of this country because they crossed

me.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

So I'll make you another trade, Jake.

I'll help you bring him down, if you

help me get her back.

52.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

... then you both can have a father.

ROBBY

Jacob, I could lose my job.

JACOB

Robby, I need to know. Now nobody

moves size in this town without using

your desk.

(BEAT)

We'll play twenty questions only it'll

be two questions and all you have to

do is say "yes or no."

ROBBY

Fire away...

JACOB

Bretton Woods... The Locust Fund...

did they make any major moves in the

last few weeks?

ROBBY

Yes.

JACOB

Was it unloading Amlyn

pharmaceuticals?

ROBBY

(NERVOUS)

Jacob...

JACOB

Robby, I got you the fucking the job!

ROBBY

Yes.

JACOB

I'm sorry to make you do that.

53.

JACOB (CONT'D)

(into the phone)

Okay Gordon... you've got yourself a

trade.

CUT TO:

FIREWORKS

WINNIE

My parents would always throw this

huge party in the Hamptons on the

fourth. The city of South Hampton

would have its firework show at 8pm

then my father would wait until it was

over then put on his... which, of

course, was always twice as

spectacular.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

Then one year the city passed an

ordinance that their firework show had

to be the last of the night... they

were sick of getting shown up by

Gordon Gekko.

JACOB

What'd he do?

WINNIE

He rented a barge and shot the

fireworks off of it a mile off the

coast... out of jurisdiction.

(then... almost to herself)

The show was even more amazing over

the water.

54.

JACOB

I think he should be invited to the

wedding.

WINNIE

No.

JACOB

Winnie, he's your father...

WINNIE

You don't know him.

JACOB

I know he's unhappy. Look at him out

there... trying to scare everybody.

He's desperate for attention.

WINNIE

This is none of your business.

JACOB

"That's not how this works."

Remember?

JACOB (CONT'D)

He's got nothing.

WINNIE

And that's what he deserves.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

The things that came out after he was

convicted. The affairs... the things

he was recorded saying...

WINNIE (CONT'D)

This wasn't the man we knew, Jacob.

It was... sociopathic.

JACOB

It was a long time ago.

55.

JACOB (CONT'D)

Just consider it, okay? That's all

I'm asking.

WINNIE

C'mon, you can meet the next President

of the United States.

SIX FOOT

Jacob... are you ready?

SIX FOOT

Do you have everything they said you'd

need?

56.

DINING ROOM

BRETTON WOODS

Jacob.

JACOB

Mr. Woods.

BRETTON WOODS

(Call me...)

Bretton.

JACOB

Okay... Bretton. I thought we were

going to meet in New York.

BRETTON WOODS

And I thought you had no interest in

working for a fund that was in

trouble.

JACOB

I was emotional. I was angry.

BRETTON WOODS

And what changed?

JACOB

I caught a glance of my portfolio.

57.

JACOB (CONT'D)

Cute dogs.

BRETTON WOODS

Dogue de Bordeaux... bred to kill.

But Contango and Backwardation here

are socialized since birth so they're

harmless.

JACOB

You named your dogs after technical

futures market terms?

BRETTON WOODS

Of course not...

(with a wink)

My children did.

JACOB

And where are your children?

BRETTON WOODS

Greece with my wife. My boys are

studying The Iliad now.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Here it is... one of the most

beautiful pieces of music you'll ever

hear.

58.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

"Exile On Main Street," without a

doubt The Stones greatest album.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

It was all outtakes. Throwaway

tracks. And the critics hated it.

And it didn't sell well at first.

(BEAT)

But now it's universally known as

their best release. I asked Mick once

how he thought that happened. How

something could go from so worthless

to so valuable. He just looked at me

and said... "it never went from

worthless to valuable... just the

opinions of it did."

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

And that was the greatest lesson I

ever learned about investing.

JACOB

An asset's value can only be priced at

its perception.

BRETTON WOODS

(IMPRESSED)

Exactly. There is no intrinsic.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

You'll work out of the New York

office. I wouldn't want to pull you

away from your fiancee in Washington.

JACOB

Thank you.

BRETTON WOODS

She's Gordon Gekko's daughter.

JACOB

That's right.

BRETTON WOODS

He was a legend at one time. It's

quite sad how he publicly cries out

wolf now.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

You see, for a legend...

59.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

... the only thing worse than death is

becoming irrelevant.

GORDON GEKKO

Good work, kid -- you're on the inside

now.

JACOB

He's going to Dubai to raise some

money then meeting me in New York to

set me up.

GORDON GEKKO

No.

JACOB

What?

GORDON GEKKO

He's not meeting you in New York.

JACOB

Why not?

GORDON GEKKO

Because you need to go to Dubai with

him.

JACOB

I don't understand.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)

You need to do something that will

earn his trust... you need to make

yourself a hero...

60.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)

Jacob... you need to help him get this

money.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

But be cautious. Your relationship

with Bretton is still fragile -- you

fuck it up here and you're done.

JACOB

Looks better than meals I get on

United.

BRETTON WOODS

John's Pizza on Bleeker. It crossed

the Atlantic with you yesterday.

Would you like a slice?

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

I appreciate you wanting to help with

this part of the business even though

it's not your expertise.

JACOB

Well -- there's a lot I can learn from

you.

BRETTON WOODS

For this trip just stay in the

background and observe.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

We're going to meet with Oleg Bakunin.

He's a Russian oligarch on the run

because Putin wanted to steal

everything he owns. He already has a

few hundred million with us but I'm

looking to get half a billion more.

Our maintenance fee on that alone

would be ten million a year.

(BEAT)

My father didn't make half of that in

his twenty-six year career.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

He worked in a mid-level job for

United Bancorp actually...

61.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Got a fishing kit when he retired.

BRETTON WOODS (V.O.)

Richard Branson purchased Great

Britain, Rod Stewart bought Germany,

Tommy Lee bought Greece.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

(INTO PHONE)

Yes... you have to be kidding me.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Looks like a bit of news broke while

we were in the air...

GOVERNOR (ON THE TV)

The remorse I feel will always be with

me. Words cannot describe how

grateful I am for the love and

compassion they have shown me. From

those to whom much is given, much is

expected..

62.

BRETTON WOODS

He's been after us for years...

GOVERNOR (ON THE TV)

I have been given much -- the love of

my family, the faith and trust of the

people of New York, and the chance to

lead this state

BRETTON WOODS

Oh Jacob... you don't want to live in

a glass house if you're gonna play

this game.

JACOB

I don't understand. Is he resigning?

BRETTON WOODS

Yes sir.

JACOB

What'd he do?

BRETTON WOODS

Outsourced.

BRETTON WOODS (V.O.)

There's a big party for Oleg tonight

at a club called The Left Bank. It's

Roaring 20s themed so I've had

original suits from that era delivered

to our rooms.

BRETTON WOODS

Remember. Hedge funds are not banking

and this isn't Ivy-league-geography-

ninth-hole deal making.

63.

BRETTON WOODS

Oleg's a brute, he's has A.D.D. and he

likes to party.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

I'm just down the hall.

(with a smile)

I hope you don't mind I took the nicer

one.

BRETTON WOODS

If he offers you a drink -- take it.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

If he offers you a line of coke --

snort it.

64.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

If he offers you a child -- raise it.

OLEG

Bretton Woods has arrived.

OLEG (CONT'D)

I want you to meet one of the only men

in the world who might be as rich as I

am. Wait a minute... Bretton what did

oil close at today?

BRETTON WOODS

A hundred and twenty-nine dollars a

barrel.

OLEG

(to Model Girl)

Forget what I said -- I'm much richer

than him.

OLEG (CONT'D)

Who the fuck is this?

JACOB

Oleg, I'm Jacob Moore. It's nice to

meet you.

OLEG

Who the fuck is this?

BRETTON WOODS

Jacob has recently come over from KZI

to work with me.

OLEG

KZI? You worked with Andrew Zabel?

JACOB

That's right.

65.

OLEG

He was a legend.

OLEG (CONT'D)

It was that mortgage shit. He

should've just focused on managing

money and not fuck around with that

crazy mortgage shit.

OLEG (CONT'D)

It was a shame his fund was only for

institutions... I would've liked to

have invested.

OLEG (CONT'D)

In honor of the theme tonight, have a

glass of 1927 Heidsiek champagne...

OLEG (CONT'D)

This is one of two hundred bottles

discovered on a shipwreck off the

coast of Finland... thirty grand a

bottle.

OLEG

Phoenix 1000.

66.

OLEG

5000 square feet, 30 days of oxygen

capacity.

OLEG

Bretton, I have... what?... two

hundred million with you.

BRETTON WOODS

And hopefully that's just a start.

Oleg, there are so many opportunities

out there right now I feel like a kid

in the candy store.

OLEG

You know I like to spread it around...

I'm like my own fund of funds. I

don't like to have too much with one

manager.

OLEG (CONT'D)

You never really know who to trust in

this world.

JACOB

I couldn't agree more, Oleg. It's one

of the first things that Andrew Zabel

taught me. I worked very closely with

him. It's why Bretton hired me. To

get behind the Andrew Zabel curtain.

JACOB (CONT'D)

You said before that you always wanted

to invest with Zabel but couldn't

because he only handled institutional

money. Well here's your chance.

Zabel taught me everything he knew.

67.

OLEG

Such as... ?

JACOB

Well, I'm not going to give you the

whole cake, Oleg...

JACOB (CONT'D)

But I can give you a little bite...

(BEAT)

It involves building positions in high

yielding stocks new to volatility then

writing calls with split strike

prices.

JACOB (CONT'D)

It's complicated but like Bretton said

-- right now there are more

opportunities than ever.

OLEG

Interesting.

NADIA

We're here for the party.

JACOB

What party?

PAULINA

Oleg said you needed a party...

NADIA

... and we're it.

68.

JACOB

Come in.

PAULINA (O.S.)

Right there... ?

JACOB (O.S.)

No... not there...

NADIA (O.S.)

How about there? I bet you want me to

do it there.

JACOB (O.S.)

No... I want you to hold it.

NADIA (O.S.)

But it's gone up so much.

JACOB

I know... but if you're going to

correctly utilize this technical head

and shoulders strategy, you need to

hold the stock until...

(pointing on the chart)

... right here.

PAULINA

I always sell too soon.

JACOB

Very common mistake. You need to cut

your losers short and let your winners

run.

NADIA

Good advice for everything... no?

JACOB

Okay. I think enough time has passed.

I appreciate you guys keeping our

little secret.

69.

NADIA

You must love her very much.

JACOB

I do.

PAULINA

The most famous hooker in the world.

JACOB

Is she a gift from Oleg?

PAULINA

No. She's Bretton's go-to.

NADIA

He flies her in wherever he's at.

BRETTON WOODS

You look like crap.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Let me ask you something... was that

speech about split strike prices and

stocks new to volatility for real?

JACOB

No Bretton. That was all bullshit.

70.

BRETTON WOODS

Well, it worked. Oleg's wiring us

five hundred million dollars today.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Good job, Jacob...

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)(PRE-LAP)

So he trust you now.

JACOB (V.O.)

I think so.

GORDON GEKKO

Well, I'm happy to help.

(AND THEN)

What about your end of the trade,

Sport?

JACOB

Oh... I'm still working on it.

(BEAT)

I'll talk to her. I promise.

GORDON GEKKO

(TO VENDOR)

Hot dog.

(TO JACOB)

What do you want?

JACOB

(TO VENDOR)

I'll take a pretzel.

GORDON GEKKO

So you're a hedge fund cowboy now?

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Goddamn hedge funds -- what a racket.

Playing the world casino, betting

other people's money with leverage.

And it's completely legal and

completely unregulated.

(MORE)

71.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

The hustles they get away with make

insider trading seem like a parking

ticket.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Nassim Tariq and his Frontier Fund.

With their slews of MIT grads who

become glorified millionaire robots

pushing buttons...

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

... slaves to top-secret propriety

elegant algorithms that work until

they don't.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Or the baby cub funds like Sammy

Rosen's Essex Advisers... filled with

Goldman Sachs and Julian Robertson

pedigree.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Men who are way too rich, lazy and

tired to run money properly anymore.

OFFICE

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Or Allan Daniel's and his bully

operation.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

... with his angry letters to company

boards that are nothing but veiled

threats in the name of activism.

72.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

So you're inside... you have his

trust... and now you want to know

what's next.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Here's the thing about Bretton. He

puts all of his money into his own

fund which makes him stupid,

egotistical, and most importantly...

vulnerable.

(BEAT)

And he chases. He doesn't take losses

well and he chases with leverage. He

thinks he's a trader, he thinks he's

an investor but he's not. He's a

gambler.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

That pretzel looks good.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Care to make a trade?

JACOB

Whatever.

GORDON GEKKO

As for your end of our trade.

(BEAT)

Find a way for me to reunite with my

daughter, Jake. Because we both know

how she would react to the fact that

you've been lying to her about bonding

with your future father-in-law.

JACOB

Is that a threat?

GORDON GEKKO

Absolutely.

JACOB

You're priceless, Gordon.

73.

GORDON GEKKO

Just be happy I'm on your team.

(AND THEN)

Get him into a bad position and watch

him chase it.

JACOB

What bad position?

GORDON GEKKO

What have I been saying all along,

Kid?

JACOB

Financials.

GORDON GEKKO

They're a death trap -- mark my words.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)

But he won't fall for a brokerage or

bank play this late in the game.

Everyone knows they're poison.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Sell him on insurance. There's a case

to be made for those stocks... ill-

fated as they may be.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

But take your time... make him think

you've been doing your due diligence.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Make it look like you're working your

ass off to find him this genius

trade... come in early, leave late and

don't bring up the idea for at least a

few weeks.

74.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And then Jacob...

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

... sell him hard... then watch him

bite... then watch him chase...

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

... then watch him come undone.

JACOB

Bring it.

DIEGO

What's the most dangerous question on

Wall Street?

JACOB

Tell me.

DIEGO

"How are you?"

JACOB

Why are you with me?

WINNIE

What?

75.

JACOB

You hate finance. You hate Wall

Street. Why are you with me?

WINNIE

Repetition compulsion.

JACOB

Huh?

WINNIE

It's Freud.

JACOB

And what does it mean, psych major?

WINNIE

Well, it's when people repeat the same

dysfunctional relationships from

childhood in their adult life in hopes

of trying to master them.

JACOB

Like when children of alcoholics fall

in love with alcoholics.

WINNIE

Yeah.

JACOB

That's great, Winnie.

WINNIE

Jacob, that might be why I was

initially attracted to you... but it's

not why I love you.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

I love you because you're

compassionate and you care so deeply

about what you do and you have like no

ego, it's crazy.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

And you're the smartest person I've

ever met... and there's nobody I trust

more in the world.

76.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

What's wrong?

JACOB

Nothing...

JACOB (CONT'D)

I just wish you would master that

relationship from childhood so you can

move forward with this one.

CUT TO:

JACOB

Bretton... I found something I like.

BRETTON WOODS

I've been wondering when my new

portfolio manager was going to come to

me with something special.

JACOB

I just wanted to make sure I would be

bringing you the smartest idea

possible. I know you don't go light.

BRETTON WOODS

That's right. If I commit to this...

we go large and we don't back down.

JACOB

It might be better to do this in the

office. I have color and support to

PRESENT--

77.

BRETTON WOODS

C'mon Jacob, you know that's not how

we do.

BRETTON WOODS

This is how we do.

JACOB

And we're allowed to ride these

through here?

BRETTON WOODS

No.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Follow me...

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

You're going to have to keep up.

JACOB

Okay. I'm just getting used to it.

78.

BRETTON WOODS

Tell me your idea.

JACOB

Here?

BRETTON WOODS

Where else?

JACOB

Right. Okay.

(COLLECTING HIMSELF)

Are you still short any of the

financials?

BRETTON WOODS

No. After KZI, I took profits.

JACOB

I think it's time to go the other way.

BRETTON WOODS

Banks?

JACOB

Insurance companies. I'm talking the

old school insurers that have become

the babies thrown out with the bath

water.

BRETTON WOODS

Keep up!

79.

JACOB

The basket of stocks I'm putting

together focuses on reinsurance

brokering and management services for

businesses. They're trading below

book and have large dividends.

(BEAT)

I say we buy them here.

BRETTON WOODS

Financials are a falling knife.

JACOB

I'm not arguing that... but the best

opportunities are found where angels

fear to tread.

JACOB (CONT'D)

So yeah -- they are falling knives.

But Bretton...

JACOB (CONT'D)

... what's life without a little blood

on your hands?

BRETTON WOODS (V.O.)

Okay. Then I want you to build

positions in your favorite three

names.

BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I want you stealth. Use all six

trading desks we're in business with.

80.

BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And if they go down... we increase our

size.

BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

See Jacob -- I don't believe in

"wrong."

BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I only believe in "not right yet."

WINNIE

He chose this restaurant.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

We used to come here every Sunday

night.

JACOB

You're going to be fine.

WINNIE

I'm only doing this for you.

JACOB

No. You're doing this for you.

WINNIE

We're never having sex again.

JACOB

Then what my friends say about

marriage will be true.

81.

WINNIE

Oh, shut up.

GORDON GEKKO

Hi.

WINNIE

Hey.

JACOB

Mr. Gekko, I'm Jacob Moore, we spoke

on the phone. Nice to finally meet in

person.

GORDON GEKKO

Yes.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Jacob, shall we get some wine?

JACOB

I don't drink.

GORDON GEKKO

Oh... okay.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Let me guess... the ginger garlic

lobster.

WINNIE

(TO JACOB)

I used to order that every time.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

I'm not really hungry.

82.

GORDON GEKKO

I've been following your career,

Winnie. Senator Lehigh said some very

nice things about you in The American

Prospect interview.

WINNIE

Yeah. She's really been... very...

supportive of my...

WINNIE (CONT'D)

I can't do this.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. I can't do this.

GORDON GEKKO

It's okay. This is a long term

investment.

(BEAT)

Go after her. She needs you.

JACOB

Winnie... Winnie...

WINNIE

You don't understand.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

My mother couldn't handle Rudy. He

was so out of control. I couldn't

help him.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

(RE GEKKO)

If he wasn't in prison... if he had

been there. I know it would've been

different.

JACOB

Your brother's dead, Winnie.

83.

JACOB (CONT'D)

Your father isn't.

WINNIE

He's not the person people think he

is.

JACOB

It was a long time ago.

WINNIE

He'll hurt us. Can't we just go home?

Please... Jacob. It's raining.

JACOB

(what am I doing?)

I love you. You don't have to do

this.

(AND THEN)

Let's just go home.

JACOB

Yes.

BRETTON WOODS

Your insurance companies are down.

JACOB

Bretton.

BRETTON WOODS

I want to increase our size.

JACOB

Okay. Good. It's just a matter of

time before they turn. I'll call the

DESKS TOMORROW--

BRETTON WOODS

Jacob, I want you to triple our

positions on all three.

84.

JACOB

Okay.

BRETTON WOODS

And they better fucking go up.

GORDON GEKKO (PRELAP)

The instant you know you're in trouble

is the exact moment when a sound

investment thesis turns into blind

hope.

GORDON GEKKO

Tripling the size... that's a very

aggressive move.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

And I promise you he's using leverage

to do this.

JACOB

He's chasing.

TOM

Mr Gekko, I'm Tom Sanders. I write

for Barrons.

GORDON GEKKO

I've heard of it.

TOM

I'm sure you have.

(BEAT)

Well, I'm doing a piece of Wall Street

moguls who ended up going to prison.

I've already talked to Boesky and

Milken and would love to sit down with

you.

GORDON GEKKO

Can you give me the cover?

85.

TOM

Well, I... um... don't make those

decisions.

GORDON GEKKO

Get me the cover and I'll give you

seventy minutes.

TOM

I'll... take that as a no.

GORDON GEKKO

(almost to himself)

Both those assholes got the cover when

they were convicted.

JACOB

How do we know the insurance companies

are going to continue going down?

GORDON GEKKO

It's all going down.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Just wait.

CUT TO:

86.

BILL MAHER

Welcome to the 2008 Financial Follies!

(APPLAUDS)

I'm Bill Maher and I'm getting paid in

Euros.

BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

When The Financial Writers Association

asked me to host an event for the

world of finance, I was shocked. I'm

known in Washington not Wall Street...

(BEAT)

... but then they informed me that

Washington is actually in the process

of buying Wall Street, so it all makes

sense.

BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

I asked them if anything's off limits.

And they said to stay away from the

brokerages, banks and insurers...

(pause for effect, then...)

... where the fuck was that advice

five months ago?

BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

I see Sammy Rosen's here.

BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

Sammy, how are you?

SAMMY ROSEN

Doing well.

BILL MAHER

(to the room)

Of course he is... in the amount of

time it took for us to have that

exchange, he made three hundred and

nine thousand dollars.

(back to Sammy)

Sammy, let me give you some free

advice, the next time someone with bad

eyesight wants to sell you a hundred

and fifty million dollar painting...

don't let them personally deliver it.

87.

BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

Somebody told me Gordon Gekko is here.

Gordon... ?

BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

There you are. I have some inside

information for you, Gekko... sex

sells books, not bread lines.

BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

Talk about your sour grapes.

Seriously Gordon -- just because the

SEC doesn't let you make obscene

amounts of money by being wrong and

nefarious doesn't mean you have to

ruin it for all of these hard working

people.

BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

Okay, we have a video to show now.

It's a very detailed and academic

account of the current mortgage

crises. Let `er rip!

FIRST FRAME

POOR MAN

I'd like a mortgage... I don't really

have any money though... is that cool?

BANKER MAN

Totally cool. Since housing prices

are always going up it won't be a

problem.

POOR MAN

You guys are awesome!

NEXT FRAME

88.

BANKER MAN

Wow, these mortgages are really

beginning to smell. I better sell

them to smart people.

NEXT FRAME

SMART MAN

Wow, these mortgages we just bought

really smell. I better sell them to

foreigners.

NEXT FRAME

SMART MAN (CONT'D)

Mix those crappy mortgages in real

good with the clean ones so the rating

agencies won't smell them.

NEXT FRAME

RICH MAN

Good news, Smart Man, not only did

foreigners buy those traunches, but so

did school boards and charities and

big pensions.

(BEAT)

Why did they buy them you ask? Well,

they were looking for a really secure

risk-free investment and they were all

triple A, so...

NEXT FRAME

NORWEGIAN MAN

Hey man! What the fuck? We're not

receiving our monthly payments!

NEXT FRAME

RICH MAN

Yeah, we fucked up.

89.

NORWEGIAN MAN

What about the rating agencies?

RICH MAN

Yeah, they fucked up too.

NORWEGIAN MAN

What about the investment bank that

put these CDO's together?

RICH MAN

Fucked up.

NORWEGIAN MAN

What about the bank that made the

original loan?

RICH MAN

Totally fucked up.

NORWEGIAN MAN

What am I supposed to tell my

villagers?

RICH MAN

That you fucked up.

BILL MAHER

What a year -- enjoy the night!

BRETTON WOODS

It's a good question... what do you

think, George?

GEORGE

The definition of rich... flying

private.

90.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Jacob... ? What do you think?

JACOB

To be rich... is to have the love of a

good woman.

JACOB (CONT'D)

(with a smile)

For real... I truly believe that.

JACOB (CONT'D)

Bretton... what's your definition of

rich?

VOICE (O.S.)

To have twice as much money as you

currently do.

GORDON GEKKO

Isn't that what you always say,

Bretton?

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

He brings up the question, runs it

round the table then finishes with

that. It's an old bit.

BRETTON WOODS

Be careful Gordon...

(looking at Jacob)

... your daughter's financial health

is in my hands now.

GORDON GEKKO

That's right.

(BEAT)

And the way The Locust Fund has been

buying up the insurance companies

lately makes me worried about my

future grandchildren's college

educations.

JACOB

(TO BRETTON)

I didn't tell him.

91.

BRETTON WOODS

No, I don't suppose you did.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Go ahead, Jacob, preach your book...

defend your names.

JACOB

We have a proactive central bank, the

charts show a clear bottom on July

15th and these companies are trading

at half of what they were six months

ago.

GORDON GEKKO

Just cause it's low don't make it

cheap, Sport.

JACOB

I read your book.

GORDON GEKKO

It's not out yet.

JACOB

I have a friend in publishing.

(BEAT)

25% unemployment... stagflation...

bread lines... Martial law...

government seizures of assets and

gold... end of democracy...

JACOB (CONT'D)

Really Gordon? Do you really need

attention that badly?

GORDON GEKKO

Since I have forty-four seconds to

spare, I'm going to tell you a story.

It's about a guy named Sam.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Sam used to work a job, he made things

and he grew things and he sold those

things. Until one day Sam got a

credit card and was amazed how easy it

was to buy things with it. So Sam got

another card and then another. Then

he used the credit card money to make

it look like he had an income... and

he used that "income" to secure a

loan.

(MORE)

92.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

And with that loan Sam bought a fancy

BMW car and rented a fancy penthouse

apartment.

(BEAT)

Now, the credit cards hit their limit

and the bank needed him to service

that loan, so Sam went to his friends.

His Chinese friend... and his Japanese

friend... and his British friend and

so on. And his friends loaned Sam

money.

(ANOTHER BEAT)

And that brings us to today... where

Sam owes the credit cards and Sam owes

the banks and Sam owes his friends and

eventually they're going to take away

Sam's fancy BMW car and his fancy

penthouse apartment.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

And Sam doesn't make anything anymore

and Sam doesn't grow anything anymore

so Sam doesn't sell anything anymore.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Our favorite Uncle Sam's desperate,

Jake... and he just found a printing

press in his basement.

(BEAT)

So you tell me -- where do we go from

here?

BRETTON WOODS

(RE GEKKO)

It is sad isn't it? That he can't

just take his ball and go home.

(BEAT)

That he has to piss on the whole game.

DIEGO

(doing his best Howard

COSELL)

Down goes Lehman! Down goes Lehman!

Down goes Lehman!

93.

BRETTON WOODS

They're not going to save it. They're

just going to let it bloody die!

ALEXIS GLICK (ON TV)

And as another US banking institution

collapses, Congress is working quickly

on a bailout package that will

distribute over three hundred billion

dollars to other banks in trouble.

BRETTON WOODS

We're getting fucking killed.

JACOB

It's capitulation.

BRETTON WOODS

Then buy more.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Cost us down to current levels.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

It's just a question of time before

this turns around... right?

JACOB

Right.

BRETTON WOODS

Fuck it.

94.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Leverage is sexy.

CUT TO:

WINNIE (O.S.)

I would hear him in the kitchen.

JACOB

I'm sorry, you have an early train.

I'm going to just go to the office

now.

WINNIE

He didn't want to keep my mother awake

so he'd go into the kitchen and sit

there. I could hear him because my

room was right up the back stairs.

I'd go and sit with him sometimes.

We'd eat ice cream.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

I was only eight but I could tell he

was worried about something and that

made me worried.

(softly, almost to herself)

Then the market would go back up and

he would sleep through the night

again.

JACOB

It's not the market, Winnie.

JACOB (CONT'D)

It's just that I haven't been able to

sleep through the night since...

95.

WINNIE

I wish I could tell you something was

going to come along that would make it

better but I can't. It's just going

to take time, Jacob. A lot of time.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

Have you been counting Fridays?

WINNIE (CONT'D)

I still count Tuesdays.

(BEAT)

All seven hundred and twenty eight of

them.

JACOB

Go back to sleep.

WINNIE

(calling out after him)

Jacob, you forgot...

BRIAN SULLIVAN (ON TV)

It's a complete unmitigated bloodbath

out there. The S&P tried to rally at

about 10am but it was met with yet

another brutal wave of selling and

people... we're now at our lows for

the day, the week, the month and the

year.

96.

BRETTON WOODS (O.S.)

Are you happy?

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

We're done.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Finished...

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Bank notices...

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Margin calls...

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Redemptions...

BRETTON WOODS

JACOB

What happened to composure, Bretton?

BRETTON WOODS

Well, I suppose it went to hell with

your fucking insurance stocks.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

It's not making sense to me anymore.

The market always made sense to me and

for the most part... I was better than

it... quicker than it.

(MORE)

97.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

(BEAT)

But it's moving too fast now and it

looks like the world is going to shit

anyway.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

If I unwind the fund now I'll still

walk with six hundred million or so.

JACOB

What?

BRETTON WOODS

It's time to call it a day. Spend

more time with my family. I suppose

this moment comes for all of us.

JACOB

You still have six hundred million?

JACOB (CONT'D)

(almost to himself)

That's a fortune.

BRETTON WOODS

I guess it's all relative.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

And Jacob -- you're the worst

portfolio manager I've ever seen.

JACOB

He wants to close the fund... he wants

to ride off into the fucking sunset...

GORDON GEKKO

Okay...

98.

JACOB

No, it's not okay... because we're so

fucking close... and he's going to

walk with six hundred million dollars

and that's unacceptable.

GORDON GEKKO

I don't know what to tell you, Pal.

You wanted to make him bleed, I wanted

my daughter back...

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

... looks like life brings

disappointment to us all.

JACOB

What happened to slaughtering men,

Gordon? What happened to turning them

into penny-ante brokers in

Poughkeepsie?

GORDON GEKKO

Look at you. This can't possibly be

the man my daughter fell in love with.

JACOB

I want to finish the job.

GORDON GEKKO

Why?

JACOB

Because nobody gave a shit about me

before Andrew Zabel came along.

Because he didn't deserve what he got.

GORDON GEKKO

The universe is an efficient market,

Kid... we all get what we deserve.

JACOB

Did you?

GORDON GEKKO

I know you cared about him... and I

know how that motivates. But Jacob...

he wasn't such a Saint.

99.

JACOB

What's that supposed to mean?

GORDON GEKKO

You don't want to know.

JACOB

I'm sorry she doesn't want anything to

do with you, Gordon -- I'm sorry she

doesn't love you!

GORDON GEKKO

Okay Jake... you want to know.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Did you ever think about it? I mean

really think about it? How someone

could make money year after year...

even through bear markets?

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

On November 15th, 1903 an Italian man

arrived aboard the S.S. Vancouver in

Boston. He had two dollars and fifty

cents to his name. Yet just a few

years later he was millionaire. You

wanna know how? He had invented a

scheme... it was quite simple

actually.

JACOB

No...

GORDON GEKKO

He would get people to invest with him

by offering larger than normal returns

then pay the old investors with the

new investors money. As long as there

was fresh money, he could keep going.

Do you know what his name was, Jacob?

It was Charles...

(BEAT)

Charles Ponzi.

100.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Research facilities...

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And scholarships...

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And retirees...

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

All of them went to bed thinking they

were perfectly fine... are going to

wake up to find they're completely

wiped out...

JACOB

You're lying.

GORDON GEKKO

I'm not, Son. I wish I were.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

See Jacob, you knew how to get that

out of me. By playing me off of what

I really want... my daughter back.

(BEAT)

So you need get Bretton back in the

game... play him off of what he really

wants.

MORGAN PORTFOLIO MANAGER

It's ugly out there dude. I wake up

everyday wondering if today's the day

we're going under.

101.

JACOB

I know. But I do have something for

you...

HEDGE FUND PM

I was going to get the new Maserati,

but... you know...

JACOB

So I heard something earlier today...

BLOGGER

It's so much better working out

outdoors... that gym was so stuffy.

JACOB

Not to mention expensive.

BLOGGER

Right.

JACOB

So, you've obviously heard the rumor?

102.

BRETTON WOODS (O.S.)

I don't like unannounced visits.

JACOB

United Bancorp is going under. Wells

Fargo has stepped up but the offer is

insanely low.

BRETTON WOODS

I know all this.

JACOB

You still have the fund and you still

have the leverage that comes with it.

You want out of the game... buy a

bank.

BRETTON WOODS

Why are you doing this?

JACOB

Because I got you into those insurance

companies... because I let you down...

BRETTON WOODS

I don't like the mortgage toxic waste.

It can't be quantified... and it

spreads...

JACOB

I worked it out already. You wouldn't

have to take it.

BRETTON WOODS

How'd you do that?

JACOB

Well, Wells won't insure the Zabel

institutional money. It's against

their policy.

JACOB (CONT'D)

I told them you would.

BRETTON WOODS

Then who would take on the mortgage

securities?

103.

JACOB

Uncle Sam.

BRETTON WOODS

So, I'd get the bank, the KZI assets

including the institutional fund yet

none of the mortgage securities.

JACOB

You could actually own the bank your

father toiled away at his whole

career. Think about that, Bretton.

BRETTON WOODS

We're going to lose our credit. I'm

facing margin calls.

JACOB

So in order to stay in the game... we

need fresh money.

JACOB (CONT'D)

OLEG--

BRETTON WOODS

(not going to work)

Oil's crashing.

JACOB

And how much do we need?

BRETTON WOODS

Fifty, sixty million minimum... and

that's just to hold off the current

margin calls.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

God, de-leveraging is a bitch.

JACOB

Sit tight. I'm going to get us the

money.

104.

BRETTON WOODS

From who... ?

LADY

I have a question... what exactly is

"moral hazard?"

GORDON GEKKO

Short version -- taking risks you're

not accountable for with other

people's money.

JACOB

He's going for it. We're almost home.

GORDON GEKKO

There you go.

JACOB

But he needs fresh money to serve the

leverage. A hundred million.

GORDON GEKKO

I'm a writer now. We don't make that

much.

JACOB

I know that, but I figured you might

know how to get it.

105.

GORDON GEKKO

Well, if you need money that badly,

Jake... you might want to check closer

to home.

WINNIE

It's a lot.

JACOB

How much?

WINNIE

I don't know, Jacob. I never really

considered it mine.

JACOB

But it is... right? It's your money?

WINNIE

(glaring at him)

You might want to wipe some of the

drool off your face...

JACOB

I'm not kidding. This is important.

WINNIE

Yes, it's mine. When he went to

prison, my father put a lot of money

in our names. And when Rudy died it

all became mine.

(BEAT)

But it's in a trust. I can't get to

it until I'm thirty-five and even then

I was planning on giving it to

charity.

JACOB

Let's say I can figure out a way for

you to get it. Take a loan against it

-- something like that. Will you do

that for me?

WINNIE

Why are you doing this, Jacob?

106.

JACOB

This is my only chance to make things

right, Winnie.

HADLEY

Gordon couldn't invest any of his

money so he put most of it into the

children's names with directions on

how it was to be invested.

(BEAT)

He definitely knew what he was

doing...

JACOB

And how could Winnie get it now?

HADLEY

Well, she'd have to sign a reversion

of trust document. That way the funds

would revert back to their pre-trust

posture and regulations.

JACOB

So all she has to do is sign a piece

of paper?

HADLEY

Basically.

JACOB

How much is in there?

HADLEY

It's complicated. There's private

equity ownership, real estate, a very

large position in a bank... all sorts

of investment vehicles.

JACOB

Ballpark it for me.

HADLEY

I don't know. Assuming immediate

liquidity... over three hundred

million.

107.

HADLEY (CONT'D)

Of course... Gordon would have to sign

the document as well.

GORDON GEKKO

You also would need the trust's

executor to sign it.

JACOB

Who is that?

GORDON GEKKO

Sammy Redding. He's a lifelong

friend. It won't be a problem.

JACOB

What about you?

GORDON GEKKO

I would love to sign it, Jacob.

Consider it done.

JACOB

Thank you. Thank you, Gordon.

GORDON GEKKO

Just after you agree to two things.

JACOB

Anything.

GORDON GEKKO

Before Bretton buys the bank, he must

use all of Winnie's money and all the

Locust Fund's leverage to go against

the market. They're about to pass

this bailout and I want to be on the

other side of it.

(BEAT)

This thing's going to hell in a bucket

and I'm sick of being on sidelines,

Pal.

JACOB

But what about--

GORDON GEKKO

It's just for a few weeks then it's

right back to our plan.

108.

JACOB

Okay.

(AND THEN)

What's the second thing... ?

WINNIE GEKKO

GORDON GEKKO

Winnie... come here... you're all I

have left now.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

He was my only son. And I messed that

up. I messed it all up, I know that.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

But please... forgive me...

WINNIE

You always get what you want, Dad.

109.

JACOB

(into his phone)

Okay, it looks like this bailout's

going to pass...

JACOB (CONT'D)

(into his phone)

... there's going to be an initial

bounce...

JACOB (CONT'D)

(into his phone)

We're going to sell that bounce.

JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

First we're going to unload all of our

positions in the insurers.

JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Then we're going to go the other

way... we're going to bet against this

market... aggressively.

JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Against the S&P, the Nasdaq, the

Dow...

JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

... the financials, China, India,

Brazil...

110.

JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

... the brokerages that are still

left, all the froth from the last two

years...

JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Gentlemen, anything that can be

sold... we're going to sell.

CUT TO:

JACOB

What? No market joke today?

DIEGO

It stopped being funny.

JACOB

I thought you were in London.

BRETTON WOODS

The United Bancorp deal is going to go

through. I've begun unwinding all our

positions.

JACOB

But our deal with Gordon was that we

have to stay short until November 5th.

JACOB (CONT'D)

What?

111.

BRETTON WOODS

Jacob, Gordon redeemed all his money

yesterday. We're clean with him.

BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

Is something wrong?

JACOB

No. No, everything's great.

JACOB (CONT'D)

Let's go buy a bank.

JACOB

Thank you, he hasn't answered his

phone and we're very worried.

JACOB

He played me...

JACOB (CONT'D)

He played us.

WINNIE

I don't give a shit about the money.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

This is who he is.

JACOB

I lied to you. I contacted him. I

spent time with him. Without you

knowing.

112.

WINNIE

I knew.

JACOB

You knew?

WINNIE

I saw the picture in your wallet.

JACOB

Then why didn't you say anything?

WINNIE

Because I wanted to give you a chance

to say something first.

(BEAT)

Because I love you, I really do.

WINNIE (CONT'D)

And because I desperately wanted to

find something in you to believe in.

(shaking her head in

DISAPPOINTMENT)

But Jacob... you've become that exact

thing I've been trying to master...

WINNIE (CONT'D)

... you've become him.

HADLEY

It's completely legal, Jacob. The

funds reverted back to the pre-trust

posture... that means the money was

technically Gordon's again.

JACOB

But he's not allowed to trade.

HADLEY

He didn't trade.

JACOB

He put the money into the hedge fund,

that's considered capital investment.

HADLEY

Jacob, Gordon never put the money into

a hedge fund. He simply took control

of the bank.

113.

JACOB

Bank? What bank?

HADLEY

Hudson River. I told you about the

position in the bank.

JACOB

Hudson River... ? I don't understand.

HADLEY (V.O.)

Well, Gordon had placed his Hudson

River shares into the trust before he

was convicted. You do know he started

out there?

HADLEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Okay, then the trust aggressively

acquired more shares about two years

ago... enough to have a controlling

position in the bank.

JACOB

But how? Gordon wasn't allowed to

control the trust.

HADLEY

That's right. All of the trust's

moves were made by its executor.

JACOB

Sammy Redding?

HADLEY

Sammy Redding? Who the hell is Sammy

Redding?

(BEAT)

Jacob, the executor of Winnie's trust

has always been Bretton Woods.

114.

JACOB

So we're throwing Bretton's birthday

party at Balmoral.

MANAGER

Well, we're very proud to have such a

resounding success hail from these

hallowed halls I assure you.

(BEAT)

We've been trying to get Bretton to

come back and speak to our younger

brokers, but... he's a hard man to

reach.

JACOB

That's funny because he often speaks

about his days here at Redmayne and

Bentley... anyway, what I'm hoping you

can help me with were records of his

early trades. Years ago.

(BEAT)

We think it'll be fun to bring up some

of Bretton's real losers from when he

was starting out... you know we all

have dogs.

MANAGER

Of course... but it is against policy

to allow just anyone to see those

records.

JACOB

I completely understand. How about

this? I'll make you a trade.

(BEAT)

You let me see the records for

Bretton's party...

JACOB (CONT'D)

... and I'll make sure Bretton gives

your young brokers a speech that will

blow them away.

115.

JACOB

Wow, Bretton -- you really kicked some

ass for client forty one.

JACOB (CONT'D)

(all making sense now)

Bud Fox wasn't the only one.

OLEG

It's been a bitch of a month, my

friend... tell me this visit does not

bring bad news.

OLEG

You want me to audit The Locust Fund?

JACOB

That's right. I want you to tell

Bretton you need the official records

of all the fund's activity starting

with when you gave him the original

two hundred million. You need this

because The Russian Federal Tax

Service is up your ass and you have to

play ball with them.

OLEG

And if he declines... ?

JACOB

You'll have no choice but to pull your

money.

116.

OLEG

And why would I do that?

JACOB

Because if you do this for me, Oleg,

I'll teach you the Andrew Zabel magic.

I'll explain to you, in detail, all of

his techniques... I'll give you all

his secrets... it's less complicated

than you might think.

JACOB

Hello... Okay, thank you.

OLEG

All the Locust Fund's trades for the

last two years.

OLEG (CONT'D)

Now give it to me. Let me behind the

Andrew Zabel curtain...

JACOB

They were working together. Your

father and Bretton.

117.

WINNIE

Jacob, what are you doing here?

JACOB

Gordon wanted the trust the whole

time. And when I came to him seeking

revenge... he saw his window.

WINNIE

I have to go to work.

JACOB

Bretton owed him a favor because he

fed your father information twenty

three years ago when he was a young

broker in London and your father never

ratted him out.

JACOB (CONT'D)

And he never put the money into

Bretton's fund. Turns out your trust

had built up a controlling position in

Hudson River Bank.

WINNIE

That's the bank he worked at when I

was born.

JACOB

Well, now he owns it. Or shall I say

pilfered it before he went AWOL.

(BEAT)

And that money wasn't even the

bank's... it was taxpayers'... bailout

money.

WINNIE

Jesus...

JACOB

He saw this coming years ago... from

his cell. I'm guessing he made off

with billions.

JACOB (CONT'D)

And now look?

118.

JACOB (CONT'D)

He's in London... giving interviews

and being hailed as a genius.

Everyone's buying his book and waiting

to see his next move.

WINNIE

But what about the SEC, the regulatory

agencies-- ?

JACOB

The government is flying this 700

billion dollar airplane by the seat of

it's pants. They don't know where

half of the fucking money is going.

And even if they did, do you think

they want this out there?

WINNIE

This is his revenge.

JACOB

Yup... sure beats the hell out of

insider trading, doesn't it?

WINNIE

I can't hear anymore of this.

JACOB

I'm done. I sold everything. The

ring. Everything. I gave back the

KZI bonus. I'm out and I'm broke and

I deserve it.

JACOB (CONT'D)

But Winnie, the one thing I can't

accept -- is losing you.

119.

CUT TO:

GORDON GEKKO

Did you see Barrons?

JACOB

You finally got the cover.

JACOB (CONT'D)

Everybody thinks you got rich of

betting against the system. If they

only knew...

GORDON GEKKO

The powers that be will never let that

happen.

JACOB

How much is enough, Gordon?

GORDON GEKKO

I've been asked that before...

(AND THEN)

They took a hundred, twenty two

thousand, six hundred and forty hours

from me... for a goddamn victimless

crime. All the while I sit in my 8 by

12 and watch real crooks by the

thousands give out mortgages like

candy, package them into unexplainable

derivatives and spit the cancer out

into the world.

120.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

And when I get out... who's there

waiting for me? Nobody.

(BEAT)

You better believe I'm going to get

mine.

JACOB

You're not going to miss America?

GORDON GEKKO

I'll always have America... it's why

I'm here. I'm buying the island.

(BEAT)

I know it's kitschy but it's fun and

good for business.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

I have a lot business abroad now.

Interests in an Australian copper

mine, a German solar company, some

Russian oil pipelines, a casino in

Macau... see Jake, America just isn't

where the action is anymore.

JACOB

What happened to the precious

depreciating asset of time?

GORDON GEKKO

It still trades...

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

... but I'm a billionaire now, Pal.

JACOB

I'm out, Gordon, I'm done trading.

GORDON GEKKO

I don't know why. You pulled it off,

Kid, you took him down -- granted with

my help -- but you atoned for Zabel's

sins with Bretton's money.

(BEAT)

As I see it, you're just getting

started.

JACOB

Did you ever really want to reconcile

with her?

GORDON GEKKO

(of course I did)

I'm human.

121.

JACOB

Then why did you do it?

GORDON GEKKO

Same answer.

JACOB

But it didn't work.

GORDON GEKKO

I've been trying to wire two hundred

million into her bank account but she

won't accept it.

JACOB

I know. She doesn't want it... we

don't want it.

(BEAT)

Because it's not about what you

have... it's about what you do. And

Gordon -- it's never about the money.

GORDON GEKKO

That sounds good. I bet you can even

wrap it in a pretty red bow. But

Champ, it's idealistic... and idealism

kills every trade.

(BEAT)

Winnie will realize that at some

point... and then we'll be fine.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

See Jacob -- the hustle we all fall

for is actually thinking we can fight

what's inherent, what's inevitable...

that we can somehow undo what

genetics, or God, or whatever name you

wanna tag it, has placed deep inside

of us. Because whether it's greed or

revenge or the compulsion to chase...

it all amounts to the same thing...

loss of control. And it's always

going to be there and it's always

going to be stronger than you, Pal.

122.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

It's why bubbles will always exist and

it's why we're all currently in this

mess.

JACOB

Winnie's pregnant.

JACOB (CONT'D)

It's going to be a boy.

GORDON GEKKO

What do you want?

JACOB

It's bad out there, Gordon, people are

panicked. They're not looking to

their government. They're not looking

to their trusted advisors. They're

looking to you.

GORDON GEKKO

You want me to buy?

JACOB

Publicly and aggressively.

JACOB (CONT'D)

But they're all lemmings. Simple

psychology. You once said every crash

should have a JP Morgan to step in and

save it.

(BEAT)

Well Gordon -- this is your chance to

be JP Morgan.

GORDON GEKKO

We're far from the bottom. It'll be a

dead cat bounce.

JACOB

It'll buy us time. That's all I'm

asking for... time.

(BEAT)

Time for the new administration to put

their plan into action.

GORDON GEKKO

What do I get in return?

123.

JACOB

Full clemency.

GORDON GEKKO

You can offer that?

JACOB

Your daughter can. She works with the

new Secretary of Treasury now.

GORDON GEKKO

What else?

JACOB

Winnie. Me. Your grandson.

Something money can't buy... a family.

GORDON GEKKO

Sorry son -- that's simply a trade I

cannot make.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

You wanna know what the mother of all

bubbles was? Us. The human race.

Scientists call it the Cambrian

Explosion, from the Cambrian fauna.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It happened 530 million years ago...

when all of the sudden, there was the

seemingly rapid appearance of most

major groups of complex animals.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And from it was born humanity.

124.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It was an explosion of life.

Scientists will tell you it was

unprecedented, excessive and by the

standards of evolution-time...

happened in a flash.

GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

Suddenly the world had millions of new

species... just like that.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

See -- bubbles are the purest form of

Darwinism.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

They teach us what we didn't know and

they remind us of what we forgot...

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

They kill excess and they lean out the

herd.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

They actually bring us back to the

necessary simple...

125.

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Because Jacob...

GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

... you'd be amazed what can rise from

the ashes.

FADE OUT.
