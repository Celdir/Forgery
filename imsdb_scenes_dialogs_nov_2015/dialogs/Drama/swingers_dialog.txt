MIKE

And what if I don't want to give up on

her?

ROB

You don't call.

MIKE

But you said I shouldn't call if I

wanted

to give up on her.

ROB

Right.

MIKE

So I don't call either way.

ROB

Right.

MIKE

So what's the difference?

ROB

The only difference between giving up and

not giving up is if you take her back

when she wants to come back.  See, you

can't do anything to make her want to

come back.  You can only do things to

make her not want to come back.

MIKE

So the only difference is if I forget

about her or pretend to forget about her.

ROB

Right.

MIKE

Well that sucks.

ROB

It sucks.

MIKE

So it's almost a retroactive decision.

So I could, like, let's say, forget about

her and when she comes back make like I

just pretended to forget about her.

ROB

Right...or more likely the opposite.

MIKE

Right...  Wait, what do you mean?

ROB

I mean first you'll pretend not to care,

not call - whatever, and then,

eventually, you really won't care.

MIKE

Unless she comes back first.

ROB

Ah, see, that's the thing.  Somehow they

don't come back until you really don't

care anymore.

MIKE

There's the rub.

ROB

There's the rub.

MIKE

Thanks, man.  Sorry we always talk about

the same thing all the time...

ROB

Hey man, don't sweat it.

MIKE

...It's just that you've been there.

Your advice really helps.

ROB

No problem.

MIKE

Rob, I just want you to know, you're the

only one I can talk to about her.

ROB

Thanks.  Thanks, man.

(synthesized voice)

Hello, you have

five

messages.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(male voice)

Hey, baby.  It's Trent.  I hope you're

feeling better about your old girlfriend.

I hope my advice helped...

ANSWERING MACHINE

(synthesized voice)

Skipping message.

(male voice)

Whatsup, Mike.  If you want to talk some

more about Michelle...

(synthesized voice)

Skipping message.

(female voice)

Mike, it's Chris.  Feeling better yet

about...?

(synthesized voice)

Skipping message.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(female voice)

Hi, Mike.  Did she call yet?  If she

didn't then she doesn't deserve...

(synthesized voice)

Skipping message.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(elderly female voice)

Michael, this is Grandma.  I want to know

if you got the part on that television

program.  I told the whole family and

they're very excited to know if...

(synthesized voice)

Skipping message.  End of final message.

MIKE

(lighting a cigarette,

defeated)

Shit.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(synthesized voice)

You have to put things in perspective.

MIKE

(unfazed by the sentient

appliance)

I know, I know.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(synthesized voice)

You've been through worse.

MIKE

You're right.  I know.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(synthesized voice)

Ever since I've known you.

MIKE

I don't know about that.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(synthesized voice)

Moving here from New York was much more

of an adjustment than this.

MIKE

It didn't feel that way.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(synthesized voice)

That's because it was a challenge.  You

has control over you're situation.  It

was hard, but you rose to it.

MIKE

Okay.  I'll think about that.  Bye.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(synthesized voice)

You really should.  Life, after all, is

really just a series of challenges...

MIKE

(growing irate)

Enough.  I've got to use the phone.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(synthesized voice)

Are you calling Her?

MIKE

No.  Stop, come on.

TRENT

(over phone)

Hello?

MIKE

S'up Trent?

TRENT

Lemme get off the other line, baby.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(synthesized voice over phone)

You should call your Grandmother.

MIKE

Shuddup.

TRENT

(returning to line)

That was Sue.  We got two parties

tonight.  One's for a modeling agency.

MIKE

I don't know...

TRENT

Listen to me, baby, there are going to be

beautiful babies there.

MIKE

Trent, I don't feel like going out

tonight.  I got shit to do tomorrow...

TRENT

Listen to you.  I got an audition for a

pilot at nine and I'm going.  You gotta

get out with some beautiful babies.  You

can't sit home thinking about her.

MIKE

I don't know...

TRENT

I don't know, I don't know- listen to

you.  We're gonna have fun tonight.  We

gotta get you out of that stuffy

apartment.

MIKE

We're gonna spend half the night driving

around the Hills looking for this party

and then leaving cause it sucks, then

we're gonna look for this other party you

heard about.  But, Trent, all the parties

and bars, they all suck.  I spend half

the night trying to talk to some girl

who's eyes are darting around to see if

there's someone else she should be

talking to.  And it's like I'm supposed

to be all happy cause she's wearing a

backpack.  Half of them are nasty skanks

who wouldn't be shit if they weren't

surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny

assholes.  I'm not gonna be one of those

assholes.  It's fucking depressing.  Some

skank who isn't half the woman my

girlfriend is is gonna front

me

?  It

makes me want to puke.

TRENT

(beat)

You got it bad, baby.  You need Vegas.

MIKE

What are you talking about?  Vegas?

TRENT

VEGAS

.

MIKE

What Vegas?

TRENT

We're going to Vegas.

MIKE

When?

TRENT

Tonight, baby.

MIKE

You're crazy.

TRENT

I'll pick you up in a half an hour.

MIKE

I'm not going to Vegas.

TRENT

Shut up- yes you are.  Now listen to Tee.

We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.

MIKE

I can't lose more than a hundred.

TRENT

Just bring your card.  Half an hour.

MIKE

Wait.

TRENT

What?

MIKE

What are you wearing?  I mean, we should

wear suits.

TRENT

Oh...  Now Mikey wants to be a high

roller.

MIKE

No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and

you act like you gamble a lot, they give

you free shit.

TRENT

Okay Bugsy.  Twenty minutes.

MIKE

Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.

TRENT

Be downstairs.  You're beautiful.

I took out three hundred, but I'm only

gonna bet with one.  I figure if we buy

a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and

they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then

we trade back the chips at the end of the

night.  You gotta be cool though.

TRENT

I'm cool, baby.  They're gonna give Daddy

a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's

singing.

MIKE

I'm serious.  This is how you do it.  I'm

telling you.

TRENT

I know.  Daddy's gonna get the Rainman

MIKE

(the first budding of

crankiness)

Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.

TRENT

This is the hot new place, besides, you

love pirates.  Tell me Mikey doesn't love

pirates.

MIKE

This is fuckin' post-pubescent

Disneyland.

TRENT

You gotta love the pirates, baby.  The

pirates are

money

.

MIKE

This place is dead.  I thought this was

the city that never sleeps.

TRENT

That's New York, baby.  You should know

that.  Look at the waitresses.  I'm gonna

get me a peg-leg baby.

MIKE

They're all skanks.

TRENT

Baby, there are beautiful babies here.

MIKE

Tee, the beautiful babies don't work

Wednesdays midnight to six.  This is the

skank shift.

TRENT

What are you talking about?  Look at all

the honeys.

TRENT

Arrrrg!

MIKE

Cut that shit out.

TRENT

She smiled baby.

MIKE

That's not cool.

TRENT

Did she, or did she not smile?

MIKE

It doesn't matter...

TRENT

I'm telling you, they love that shit.

MIKE

You're gonna screw up our plan.

TRENT

We're gonna get laid, baby.

MIKE

First let's see what happens if we play

it cool.

TRENT

What?  You think she's gonna tell her

pit-boss on us?

MIKE

Don't make fun, I think we can get some

free shit if we don't fuck around.

TRENT

Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun.

Let's do it, baby.

MIKE

The trick is to look like you don't need

it, then they give you shit for free.

TRENT

Well, you look

money

, baby.  We both

look

money

That's where we make our scene.

You think they're watching?

Oh, they're watching all right.  They're

watching.

MIKE

I don't know, I guess I'll start with

three hundred in, uh, blacks.

DEALER

On the table.

MIKE

Sorry?

DEALER

You have to lay it on the table.

MIKE

Uh, I don't want to bet it all.

DEALER

You're not allowed to hand me money, sir.

You'll have to lay it on the table if you

want me to change it.

MIKE

(hastily laying down the bills)

Oh... right.

DEALER

Blacks?

MIKE

Huh?

DEALER

You want this in black chips.

MIKE

Sure, that'll be fine.

MIKE

Do you have anything smaller?

DEALER

Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a

hundred-dollar-minimum bet.  Perhaps

you'd be more comfortable at one of our

lower stakes tables.

WAITRESS

Drinks?

(then to Trent)

How about you,

Cap'n

?

MIKE

(to the waitress, but never

breaking eye contact with the

dealer)

I'll have a vodka martini, straight up,

shaken not stirred, very dry.

WAITRESS

(under her breath cynically as

she writes it down)

One "James Bond".

MIKE

(regaining composure)

No.  Blacks will be fine.

eleven

.

TRENT

(hushed tones)

Double down.

MIKE

(even husheder)

What?!?

TRENT

Double down, baby.  You gotta double down

on an eleven.

MIKE

I know, but...

TRENT

You gotta do it.

MIKE

...but that's

two hundred dollars

.

This is

blood money

...

TRENT

If we don't look like we know what we're

doing, then we may as well...

MIKE

I know.

MIKE

(with all the nonchalance he

can muster)

Double down.

Eighteen

Twelve

Sixteen

Twenty one

MIKE

(to the pit boss)

Sure could use some dinner about now.

SMASH CUT TO:

TRENT

I'm telling you, baby, you

always

double

down on an eleven.

MIKE

Yeah?  Well obviously not

always

!

TRENT

Always

, baby.

MIKE

I'm just saying, not in this particular

case.

TRENT

Always.

MIKE

But I lost!  How can you say

always

?!?

BLUEHAIR

Hit.

Fifteen

all together.

BLUEHAIR

Oh...  I don't know...  Hit.

Seventeen

.  Dealer has a seven showing.

BLUEHAIR

What the hell- hit.

Twenty one

.

DEALER

(with a warm smile)

Twenty one.

PIT BOSS

Would you care for some breakfast, ma'am?

BLUEHAIR

Well...?  No, I shouldn't.  Maybe later.

Thank you, though.

MIKE

(to Trent, under his breath)

I'm gonna fuckin

kill

you.

CUT TO:

14   INT.  TREASURE ISLAND CASINO - CASHIER'S WINDOW - NIGHT          14

CASHIER

...eighty...  one hundred...  one hundred

and twenty dollars.  We hope to see you

back on the high seas soon.

(polite smile)

TRENT

What's that?  One twenty?  You're up

twenty bucks, baby.

TRENT

... Well, you know, not counting the

first table.

MIKE

Thanks for clarifying that.

TRENT

Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.

MIKE

Yea, how much?

TRENT

I don't know, what?  Thirty, Forty maybe.

MIKE

Don't give me that shit.  You know

exactly how much you lost.  What'd you

drop?

TRENT

Twenty...  but I was down at least fifty.

I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.

MIKE

You won.  There's nothing to be sorry

about.  You're a winner.  I'm the fuckin

loser.  I should be sorry.

TRENT

Baby, don't talk like that, baby.

MIKE

Let's just leave.

TRENT

Baby, you're

money

.  You're the

big

winner.

MIKE

Let's go.

TRENT

(condescending)

Who's

the big winner?

TRENT

(lifting Mike's reluctant hand

from the wrist like a boxing

champ)

Mikey's

the big winner.

MIKE

(shaking his head to hide a

smirk)

What an asshole.

TRENT

Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the

big winner.

WAITRESS

There you two are.  I walked around for

an hour with that stupid martini on my

tray.

MIKE

Sorry.  We got knocked out pretty

quickly.

CHRISTY

(sarcasm?)

A couple of high rollers like you?

MIKE

Could you believe it?

CHRISTY

Wait here, I'll get you that martini.

MIKE

Nah, I didn't really want it anyway.  I

just wanted to order it.

CHRISTY

Can I get you something else?  I mean,

you shouldn't leave without getting

something for free.

MIKE

No thanks.  Why ruin a perfect night.

TRENT

(condescending)

Bring a James Bond for me

and

my boy

Mikey, and if you tell the bartender to

go easy on the water...

(holds up a half-dollar)

...this Kennedy has your name on it.  Now

run along, I'm timing you.

MIKE

What an asshole.

TRENT

That was

money

.  Tell me that wasn't

money.

MIKE

That was so demeaning...

TRENT

She

smiled

, baby.

MIKE

I can't believe what an asshole you are.

TRENT

Did she, or did she not smile.

MIKE

She was smiling at what an asshole you

are.

TRENT

She was smiling at how

money

I am, baby.

MIKE

Let's go.  I'm not paying for a room, and

if we don't leave now we'll never make

it.

TRENT

Leave?  The honey-baby's bringing us some

cocktails.

MIKE

What are you, nuts?  You think she's

coming back?

TRENT

I

know

she's coming back.

MIKE

I don't think so.

TRENT

Baby, did you hear her?  "You shouldn't

leave without getting something for

free."  She wants to party, baby.

MIKE

You think so?

TRENT

You gotta give Tee one thing.  He's good

with the ladies.

MIKE

I'm too tired for this.  Let's just go.

TRENT

Baby, this is what we came for.  We met

a beautiful baby and she likes you.

MIKE

She likes

you

.

TRENT

Whatever.  We'll see.  Daddy's gonna get

her to bring a friend.  We'll both get

one.  I don't care if I'm with her or one

of her beautiful baby friends.

MIKE

I don't know...

TRENT

You gotta get that girl out of your head.

It's time to move on.  You're a stylish,

successful, good looking cat.  The ladies

want to love you, you just gotta let

them.

MIKE

That's bullshit.

TRENT

It's not.  You're

money

.  Any of these

ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like

you.

MIKE

It's just that I've been out of the game

so long.  Trent, I was with her for

six

years

.  That's before AIDS.  I'm scared.

I don't know how to talk to them, I don't

know...

TRENT

You can't think like that, baby.  It's

hard, I know.  I've been there.  Not for

six years, but I know.  You just gotta

get back out there.

MIKE

It's just tough, after sleeping with

someone you love for so long, to be with

someone new... who doesn't know what I

like... and you

gotta

wear a jimmy...

TRENT

...

gotta

...

MIKE

... and then I'm struggling to impress

some chick who's not half as classy as my

girlfriend, who I'm not even really

attracted to...

TRENT

Oh

fuck

that.  You don't have to try and

impress anyone.  You think I give a shit?

You think I sweat that skanky whore

waitress...

TRENT

(recovering, looking at watch)

... One fifty-nine, Two minutes.

WAITRESS

Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken

not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.

TRENT

Beautiful.  What time are you off...

... Christy?

WAITRESS

Six.

TRENT

Call a friend and have her meet the three

of us at the Landlubber Lounge at 6:01.

on her tray)

SMASH CUT TO:

15   INT.  TREASURE ISLAND CASINO - COFFEE SHOP - SAME NIGHT          15

MIKE

That was so fuckin'

money

.  It was like

that "Jedi mind" shit.

TRENT

That's what I'm telling you, baby.  The

babies love that stuff.  They don't want

all that sensitive shit.  You start

talking to them about puppy dogs and ice

cream.  They

know

what you

want

.  What do

you think?  You think they don't?

MIKE

I know.  I know.

TRENT

They know what you want, believe me.

Pretending is just a waste of time.

You're gonna take them there eventually

anyway.  Don't apologize for it.

MIKE

I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show

some respect...

TRENT

Respect, my ass.  They respect honesty.

You see how they dress when they go out?

They want to be noticed.  You're just

showing them it's working.  You gotta get

off this respect kick, baby.  There aint

nothing wrong with letting them now that

you're money and that you want to party.

WAITRESS

Are you ready to order?

MIKE

Coffee...

(points to Trent, who nods)

Two coffees.  It says "Breakfast Any

Time", right?

WAITRESS

That's right.

MIKE

I'll have "pancakes in the Age of

Enlightenment".

WAITRESS

And you?

TRENT

I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.

WAITRESS

I'll be back with the coffee.

TRENT

(genuinely)

Nice, baby.

MIKE

I should've said Renaissance, right? It

went over her head.

TRENT

Baby, you did fine.

MIKE

(disgusted with himself)

"Age of Enlightenment".  Shit.  Like some

waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is

going to get an obscure French

philosophical reference.  How demeaning.

I may as well have just said "Let me jump

your ignorant bones."...

TRENT

...Baby...

MIKE

... It's just, I thought "Renaissance"

was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino.

She

would've

gotten it, though...

TRENT

You did fine.  Don't sweat her.  We're

meeting

our

honeys soon.  You

know

Christy's friend is going to be money.

MIKE

I hope so.

(checks watch)

We gotta go soon.

TRENT

Baby, relax.  It's just down the hall.

She's gotta change... we'll be fine.

MIKE

We didn't do so bad after all.

TRENT

Baby, we're

money

.

MIKE

Excuse me.  We're in a bit of a hurry.

WAITRESS

Hang on, Voltaire.

Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.

Oh, are we late?  There are no clocks in

Well, no harm done.  This is Lisa.  I'm

sorry, I never got your names...

MIKE

I'm Mike...

Ladies, don't you double down on an

LISA

No matter

Whatever.

Hello, Lisa.  I'm Trent.  What a lovely

makeup job.

CHRISTY

Lisa works at the MGM Grand...

LISA

(apologetically)

I'm a "Dorothy".

TRENT

(trying to sell her to Mike)

Oh... a

Dorothy

.

MIKE

Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.

CHRISTY

What do you guys do?

MIKE

I'm a comedian.

LISA

Do you ever perform out here?  I'd love

to see you.

MIKE

No...

LISA

You should.  A lot of comics play Vegas.

MIKE

Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...

LISA

Why not?

MIKE

There are different circuits... it's hard

to explain... you wouldn't understand...

LISA

Who's your booking agent?

MIKE

(flustered)

Oh?  You know about booking agents...  I

don't, uh, actually have a

west coast

agent as of yet...

LISA

Well, who represents you back east?

MIKE

Actually, it's funny you...  I'm

actually, uh,

between

...

LISA

What do you do, Trent?

TRENT

I'm a producer.

BOTH GIRLS

Wow... Oooh... Ahhh...

CHRISTY

Listen, I'm not really allowed to drink

here.  We should go someplace else.

How's my place?

TRENT

No... no... The worst was when I went in

for this After-School special and I'm

sitting in the waiting room with all

these little kids.  I see they're all

signed in for the same role as me...

CHRISTY

They were auditioning for the same role

as you?

TRENT

Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the

time and place.  I'm where I'm supposed

to be.  I call my agent... She says they

asked for me specifically...

MIKE

What was the part?

TRENT

Oh... "I love you... I can't believe

you're doing this... Drugs are bad..."

Whatever.  After-School bullshit.  The

role is Brother.

MIKE

"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?

TRENT

Wait... Wait... Just "Brother".  So I go

in.  "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest

spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..."

Whatever.  So, I start to read, and,

Mikey, I was money.  I prepared for a

week.  It's a starring role.  I'm

crying... The casting director, she

starts crying...

MIKE

No!

TRENT

Yes!

LISA

Oh my God.

CHRISTY

Did you get it?

TRENT

Wait...  She's crying.  I finish.  I hold

up my finger like "Wait a second".  They

sit in silence for, like, at least five

minutes.  I look up and they all start

clapping

, and now they're

all

crying.

Even the

camera guy

.

MIKE

No!  Not the camera guy!

TRENT

I'm telling you!

LISA

So what happened?

TRENT

So, I swear to God this is exactly what

he said.  The producer says to me... now

he's still crying... he says to me that

I was great, that that was exactly what

they were looking for...

MIKE

... So give me the fuckin part...

TRENT

Right?  ... that I nailed it... Whatever.

Then he says it's just that I'm a

little

old

.  I'm like "How old is the

Brother?".  He's like, he says this with

a straight face, I swear to God, he says

"

Eleven

."

MIKE

So, what'd you say to him?  "

Double

down

."?

TRENT

It's like, you looked at my tape.  You

saw my picture.  Why did you call me in?

You knew I was twenty-four.

CHRISTY

What an asshole.

MIKE

I believe it.

CHRISTY

How rude of me.  I haven't given you the

tour.

LISA

(reassuring)

I'm sure she'll call.  Six years is a

long time.  You don't just break it off

cleanly after six years.

MIKE

I know, but she did.  She's with someone

else now...

LISA

Already?  You poor thing.  It won't last.

MIKE

Why not?

LISA

It's a rebound.

MIKE

We

were a rebound, and we lasted six

years.

LISA

Yeah, but how long was the relationship

she was rebounding

from

?

MIKE

Six years.

MIKE

Can I check my messages?  I have a

calling card.

LISA

Sure, I guess.  The phone's in the back.

MIKE

Sorry, it's just that...

LISA

I understand.

MIKE

Trent...

(knock knock)

Tee.

MIKE

Sorry, man, I need...

MIKE

No, man.  I need to use the phone.

TRENT

What?

MIKE

I gotta use the phone.

TRENT

Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.

MIKE

Please, Tee.  I have to use the phone.

Sorry, man.

TRENT

Hold on.

MIKE

(to Lisa)

I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

They weren't in there that long.

She asked me what I was thinking about?

What should I have done?  Lie?

TRENT

You didn't have to get into it, baby.

MIKE

Sorry about interrupting...

TRENT

Don't worry about me, baby.  I just

wanted you to have a good time.

MIKE

Christy was nice...

TRENT

I didn't even like her, to be honest.

MIKE

She was hot.

TRENT

She really didn't do it for me, baby.

How'd you like Dorothy?

MIKE

I don't know.  The whole Judy Garland

thing kind of turned me on.  Does that

makes me some kind of fag?

TRENT

No, baby.  You're money.

MIKE

She didn't like me, anyway.

TRENT

She thought you were money.

MIKE

I don't think so.

TRENT

I heard them talking.  They both thought

you were money.

MIKE

Yeah, a good friend.

TRENT

Baby, you take your

self

out of the game.

You start talking about puppy dogs and

ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the

friend tip.

MIKE

I just don't think she liked me in that

way.

TRENT

Baby, you're so money you don't even

know it.

MIKE

Tee, girls don't go for me the way they

go for you.

TRENT

Michelle went for you, right.

MIKE

That was different.

TRENT

How?

MIKE

I was younger... It was college.  You

didn't go to college, you don't know what

it's like.  You screw chicks you have no

business being with.  They're young, they

don't know any better.

TRENT

That's just plain silly.  Your self-

esteem is just low because she's with

someone else.  But thinking about it and

talking about it all the time is bad.

It's no good, man.  You gotta get out

there.  The ladies want to love you,

baby.

MIKE

I just need some time...

TRENT

Why?  So you can beat yourself up?

Sitting around in that stuffy apartment.

It's just plain bad for you, man.  It's

depressing.  You've come so far.

Remember the first week?  After she told

you?  You couldn't even eat.

MIKE

Don't remind me.

TRENT

You just sat around drinking orange

juice.  Now look at you.  Look how far

you've come in just a few months.  You

got that part in that movie...

MIKE

... a

day

...

TRENT

... Whatever.  It's work.  You're doing

what you love.  What's she doing?

MIKE

Selling scrap metal.

TRENT

(smiles)

See?  And what does this guy she's with

do?

MIKE

He drives a carriage.

TRENT

What?!?

MIKE

(smiling)

I hear he drives a carriage around

Central Park or something.

TRENT

Please.  And you're sweating

him

?

You're "all that" and you're sweating

some lawn jockey?

MIKE

I hear she's getting real fat.

TRENT

Baby, she's the one who should be

thinking about

you

.  Sounds to me like

you cut loose some dead weight.  Trust

me, Mikey, you're better off.

MIKE

I'm gonna try.  I'm really gonna try.

ROB

I mean, I need the money.

MIKE

You're an actor.  Find the Zen in the

role.

ROB

It's definitely a step back for me.

MIKE

Look, there's not much of a call for

Shakespeare in this town.

ROB

There's just something about being

"Goofy".  Any other Disney character

would be fine.  There's just this stigma

associated with the character.

MIKE

What do you want?  You're tall.

ROB

Do you realize how hard it's going to be

to tell my parents?  I still haven't told

them I didn't get the pilot.

MIKE

You tested over a month ago.  I'm sure

they figured it out by now.

MIKE

Why?

ROB

I don't know.  It's like not talking to

a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.

MIKE

What?  Like, you didn't want to jinx it?

ROB

Kinda.

MIKE

I don't talk about her

that

much.

ROB

Oh no?

MIKE

I didn't mention her once today.

ROB

Well, until now.  Tend the pin.

MIKE

The only reason I mentioned her at all is

to say that I'm not going to talk about

her anymore.  I thought you'd appreciate

that.

ROB

I do.  Good for you, man.

MIKE

I've decided to get out there.

(re: the ball)

Go ahead.  Play it out.

MIKE

I'm not making any more excuses for

myself.

ROB

Good to hear, Mikey.

MIKE

You want to hit the town tonight?

ROB

I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.

MIKE

What do you have?  A Pluto call back?

ROB

Sure.  Kick me when I'm down.

MIKE

Count 'em up.

ROB

How many strokes?

MIKE

I don't know.  Eight or Nine.

ROB

I'll give you an eight.

(writes score)

MIKE

What'd you get?

ROB

An eight.

MIKE

Looks like we're in a dead heat after one

hole.  This is turning into quite a

It's Pink Dot.  Buzz him in - hit nine.

I wish the game still had fights so I

could bitch-slap Wayne.

MIKE

This version doesn't have fighting?

TRENT

No.  Doesn't that suck?

MIKE

What?  That was the best part of the old

game.

SUE

I don't know.  I guess kids were hitting

each other or something.

TRENT

You could make their heads bleed, though.

SUE

Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads

bleed all over the ice and their legs

convulse.

MIKE

No.

TRENT

Yeah.

SUE

It's kinda money, actually.

MIKE

Make someone bleed.

SUE

No, man, we're in the play-offs.

MIKE

To get a drink before we meet the guys

for a bite at eleven.

ROB

Oh.

(beat)

Where is this place?

MIKE

(pulling handle)

It's one of these.  For some reason, cool

bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find

and have no signs out front.

ROB

That doesn't sound too good for business.

MIKE

(pull)

It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of

thing.  It's kinda cool.  It's like

you're in on some kind of secret.  You

tell a chick you've been some place, it's

like bragging that you know how to find

it.  The only way you could know where a

place is is if someone who knows brought

you there.  You have to have someone come

before.  There is a direct line

connecting you back to the original,

unequivocally cool, club patrons.  It's

kinda like Judaism...

ROB

Sounds more like Aids...

analogy.

please.

ROB

I can't get over how cute the girls in

this city are.

MIKE

I know.  It's like the opposite of

inbreeding.  The hottest one percent from

around the world migrate to this gene

pool.

ROB

Darwinism at its best.

MIKE

I've been around here six months and I

still can't get over it.

ROB

It's like,

every day

I see a beautiful

woman.  I'm not used to that.  I'm used

to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't

know, once a week.  I can't handle it.

MIKE

Wait till summer.  I swear, you can't

leave the house.  It hurts.  It

physically hurts.

you wouldn't've asked me.  It wasn't that

Hi.

ROB

My pleasure.

Charles and me went to network on this

pilot together.

Oh, I'm sorry.  How'd your folks take it?

I haven't heard an official "no" yet.

You haven't told then, huh?

ROB

No.

I still haven't told my folks I didn't

get "

figured it out by now, but Mom keeps

asking...

I don't even tell them about anything I'm

close on anymore...

MIKE

really expensive imported car after my

next gig in Vegas...

BLONDE

(politely interrupting)

I know!  Starbucks!  I served you an

espresso at Starbucks.

MIKE

Are you sure?  Maybe...

BLONDE

Yes!  Remember?  You asked me for an

application?  I introduced you to the

manager?

MIKE

(trying to pull out of the

dive)

Oh, yeah...  Boy, that must've been a

while ago.

BLONDE

I'd say about two weeks.

MIKE

Probably a little longer than that, but,

whatever.

BLONDE

(smiling at him)

You better pay the man.

MIKE

(fumbling with the money)

Oh...  Sorry.

MIKE

(tactical retreat)

Well, thank you...?

BLONDE

Nikki.

MIKE

Thank you, Nikki.

TRENT

We got the digits, baby.

MIKE

What a surprise.

TRENT

What's wrong?  I saw you talking to that

beautiful blonde baby.

SUE

She was cute.

MIKE

She didn't like me... I made a fool of

myself...

TRENT

Baby, don't talk that way, baby...

SUE

You are so money, and you don't even know

it...

TRENT

That's what I keep trying to tell him.

(to Mike)

You're so money, you don't even know...

MIKE

Please, don't mess with me right now...

TRENT

We're not messing with you...

SUE

... we're not...

TRENT

You're like this big beer with claws and

fangs...

SUE

... and big fuckin' teeth...

TRENT

... and teeth... And she's like this

little bunny cowering in the corner...

SUE

...shivering...

TRENT

... And you're just looking at your claws

like "How do I kill this bunny?"...

SUE

...You're just poking at it...

TRENT

... Yeah.  You're just gently batting it

around... and the rabbit's all scared...

SUE

... and you got big claws and fangs...

TRENT

... and fangs... and you're like "I don't

know what to do.  How do I kill this

bunny?"...

SUE

... you're like a big bear.

MIKE

You're not just, like, fucking with me?

TRENT

No, baby!

SUE

... honestly...

TRENT

... you're

money

...

SUE

... you're so fuckin

mmmoney

.

TRENT

Now go over there and get those digits.

SUE

You're money.

TRENT

(pulling him aside, dead

serious)

Now when you talk to her, I don't want

you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that

everyone's pulling for.  I want you to be

the guy in the rated R movie who you're

not sure if you like.

TRENT

See, baby.  It's not that hard.

CHARLES

MIKE

MIKE

How long do I wait to call?

TRENT

A day.

MIKE

Tomorrow?

TRENT

No...

SUE

... Tomorrow,

then

a day.

TRENT

... Yeah.

MIKE

So, two days?

TRENT

Yeah.  I guess you could call it that.

SUE

Definitely.  Two days.  That's the

industry standard...

TRENT

(to Sue. shop talk)

... I used to wait two days.  Now

everyone waits two days.  Three days is

kinda money now, don't you think?

SUE

... Yeah.  But two's enough not to look

anxious...

TRENT

Yeah, but three days is kinda the

money...

MIKE

(interrupting sarcastically)

Why don't I just wait three weeks and

tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and

found her number...

CHARLES

... then ask where you met her...

MIKE

Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and

then I'll ask what she looks like.

(pause)

Then I'll ask if we fucked.  How's that,

Tee?  Is that "the money"?

TRENT

Laugh all you want, but if you call to

soon you can scare off a nice baby who's

ready to party.

SUE

Don't listen to him.  You call whenever

it feels right to you.

MIKE

How long are you guys gonna wait to call

TRENT & SUE

Six days.

TRENT

SUE

... Whatever.  Things are different here.

It's not like New York, Mikey.

MIKE

Yeah.  Here it's easier to avoid trouble.

It's not like you like in Compton where

bullets are whizzing by your head every

day.  Nobody's mugging you on no subway.

In New York the trouble finds you.  Out

here you gotta go look for it...

SUE

... People get carjacked...

TRENT

... Oh, who would jack your fuckin K-car?

He's right, Sue.  You don't need no gat.

SUE

Listen.  Just because I was the only one

with the balls to stand up to them...

TRENT

... Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was

gonna do anything...

MIKE

You live in such a fantasy world...

SUE

What about you, Mikey?  At least I got

balls.  You're always whining about some

bitch who dumped you a year ago...

MIKE

... It was six months, and she didn't

dump...

SUE

... Whatever.  You're like a whining

little woman.  Big deal.  You got a

fuckin' number.  Whoopee!  You'll fuck it

TRENT

SUE

Have you gotten laid

once

since you moved

here?  Did you fuck once?

TRENT

I know for a fact you haven't, because

you never shut up about it.  Your like a

No.  Just O.J.

Sorry about what happened at the Dresden.

I had no idea...

Don't sweat it.  Now I got an L.A. gun

story.  You should hear the way I tell to

the guys back home.  He had an Uzi.

ROB

You want to talk about it?

MIKE

What's the point?

ROB

It's been two days.  You should call that

Uuuuugh!

Oh boy.

Well, you're doing so well...

How am I doing well?  I host an open mike

agency that specializes in fuckin

magicians.  How good am I doing?

ROB

At least you didn't get turned down for

Goofy...

MIKE

They turned you down?

ROB

They went for someone with more theme

park experience.  I woulda killed for

that job.

ROB

See, it's all how you look at it.  If

your life sucks, then mine is God awful.

I mean, I moved out here partially

because I saw how well you were doing.

You got in the union, you got an agent.

I thought if you could make it, maybe I

could too...

MIKE

I didn't make it...

ROB

That's your problem, man.  You can't see

what you've got, only what you've lost.

Those guys are right.  You are "money".

MIKE

(starting to cry)

Then why won't she call...?

ROB

Because you left, man.  She's got her own

world to deal with in New York.  She was

a sweet girl but fuck her.  You gotta

move on.  You gotta let go of the past.

The future is so beautiful.  Every day is

so sunny out here.  It's like Manifest

Destiny man.  I mean, we made it.  What's

past is prologue.  That which does not

kill us makes us stronger.  All that

shit.  You'll get over it.

MIKE

How did you get over it?  I mean how long

'til it stopped hurting?

ROB

Sometimes is still hurts.  You know how

it is, man.  I mean, each day you think

about it less and less.  And then one day

you wake up and you don't think of it at

all, and you almost miss that feeling.

It's kinda weird.  You miss the pain

because it was part of your life for so

long.  And the, boom, something reminds

you of her, and you just smile that

bittersweet smile.

MIKE

You

miss

the pain?

ROB

... for the same reason you miss her.

You lived with it so long.

Wow.

BRUNETTE

You don't think the guy would find me

attractive enough to dance with?

MIKE

Yes.  I mean, no.  I mean, maybe he would

find her, I mean you attractive.  Maybe

he doesn't like to dance.  Maybe all he

likes to do is just stand around and

drink and smoke and look cool with his

buddies who don't dance either...

BRUNETTE

Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good

dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's

what he's afraid of.

MIKE

(smirk)

No... Maybe that's not the case.  Maybe

she shouldn't be such a smug little shit

because she'd be surprised at what a good

... the Micheline commercial...

MICHELLE

... Yeah, with the baby in the tire.  One

time I started to cry right in front of

Pierre...

MIKE

Pierre... That's his name?  Pierre?  Is

he French?

MICHELLE

No, he's not... Listen I don't want to

talk about him.  That's a whole other

headache.  I called because I heard you

might be moving back to Queens...

MIKE

Hang on.  Let me get rid of this call.

MIKE

Hello?

LORRAINE

Hi, Mike?

MIKE

Lorraine?

LORRAINE

Are you on the other line?

MIKE

Yeah, hold on.

LORRAINE

I can call back...

MIKE

No, no.  Hold on.

MIKE

Hi.

MICHELLE

I heard you might be moving back...

MIKE

Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be

happening any time soon...  Listen, can

I call you right back?  I gotta take this

call...

MICHELLE

I'm not home and going out of town

tomorrow for a week.  Can't you talk for

five more minutes?

MIKE

I really want to catch up with you, but

I've gotta take this call.  They're

holding.  I'll talk with you when you get

back in town.  Bye.

MICHELLE

Goodbye.  I lov.....(click)

MIKE

Hi.  Sorry about that.

LORRAINE

You didn't have to get off the other

line.  I would've called you back.

MIKE

That's okay.  I wanted to talk to you.

MIKE

(to answering machine)

Do you realize that I've been waiting for

that call for six months and I cut her

off?

ANSWERING MACHINE

(synthesized voice)

You're money, baby.

MIKE

Hi, Lorraine.  Thanks for holding on.

LORRAINE

Listen, Mike.  You really didn't have to

get off the line.  I just wanted to ask

you one thing.  I know I shouldn't have

called, I mean, my friends said I should

wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound

like such a schoolgirl... It's just that

it's tonight only... I mean, it's

Sinatra's birthday and they have this

thing every year at "The Room".  Do you

know where that is?  It's impossible to

find if you've never been there.  I don't

understand why none of the clubs in

Hollywood have signs.  Anyway, I'm so bad

at this, if you're not busy I thought you

might...

FRANK

Here's to those who love not too wisely,

no, not too wisely, but too well...

To the girl who sighs with envy when she

hears that wedding bell...

To the guy who'd throw a party if he knew

someone to call...

Here's to the losers... Bless them all...

FRANK

Here's to those who drink their dinners

when that lady doesn't show...

To the girls who wait for kisses

underneath that mistletoe...

To the lonely summer lovers when the

leaves begin to fall...

Here's to the losers... Bless them all...

FRANK

Hey Tom, Dick and Harry...

Come in out of the rain...

Those torches you carry...

Must be drowned in champagne...

FRANK

Here's the last toast of the evening...

Here's to those who still believe...

All the losers will be winners...

All the givers shall receive...

Here's to trouble-free tomorrows...

May your sorrows all be small...

Here's to the losers... Bless them all.

FADE TO BLACK.
