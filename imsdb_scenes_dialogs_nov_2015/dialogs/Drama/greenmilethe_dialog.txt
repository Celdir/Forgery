WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)

You love your sister? You make any

noise, know what happens?

CUT TO:

BRAD

Old fuck.

PAUL

Oh, my...

DISSOLVE TO:

BRAD

Out for a little stroll, Paulie?

PAUL

Let go...

BRAD

What's with this poncho you got

on, huh? This isn't yours.

PAUL

I got it off the wall there.

There's a whole row of them.

BRAD

But not for you, Paulie, that's

the thing. Those are for the staff.

PAUL

I just borrowed it. Don't see what

harm it does.

BRAD

It's not about harm, it's about

rules. You probably don't think an

old fart like you has to mind

rules anymore, but that's just not

true.

PAUL

I'm sorry if I broke the rules.

BRAD

You got no business up in those

woods anyway, especially in the

rain. What if you fall and bust a

hip, huh? Who you think's gonna

have to hoss your sorry old bacon

back down here? Me, that's who.

PAUL

You're hurting me!

BRAD

What do you do up there, anyway?

You're too old to go jerk off, so

what do you do?

PAUL

Nothing. I just walk, that's all,

I like to walk!

BRAD

Come on. Open up. Let Poppa see.

ELAINE (O.S.)

Paul?

ELAINE

I saw you coming back, thought

you'd like some tea.

(beat)

Are you coming in?

PAUL

Mr. Dolan and I were...chatting.

About the weather. I think we're

through now.

BRAD

Paulie? You tell anyone I squeezed

your po' ol' hand, I'll tell 'em

you're having senile delusions.

Who you think they'll believe?

CUT TO:

PETE

Why we always watch this crap?

ELDERLY LADY #1

It's interesting.

PETE

Interesting? Bunch'a inbred

trailer trash, all they ever talk

about is fucking...

ELAINE

We should report him.

PAUL

That might just provoke him all

the more, make things worse for

everybody.

ELAINE

It's not everybody he has it in

for, Paul. It's you.

(off his look)

What did you do to provoke him in

the first place? Nothing. He's

just an abusive bully, and should

be made to stop.

PAUL

Ellie, please...

ELDERLY LADIES

...no, the Movie Classic channel

is further down...past the Home

Shopping...keep going...

ELDERLY LADY #2

Oh! This is wonderful...

FRED ASTAIRE

Heaven, I'm in heaven...and my

heart beat so that I can hardly

speak...

ELAINE

Paul? What is it?

ELAINE

Paul...my God...

ORDERLY

(rushing over)

What is it? What's wrong?

PAUL

It's okay...I'll be okay...

BRAD

S'matter, Paulie? Why the boo-hoo-

hoo? Something nasty happen?

ELAINE

Mr. Edgecomb will be perfectly

fine without your help, thank you.

CUT TO:

PAUL

I guess sometimes the past just

catches up with you, whether you

want it to or not. It's silly.

ELAINE

Was it the film?

(off his look)

It was, wasn't it?

PAUL

I haven't spoken of these things

in a long time, Ellie. Over sixty

years.

ELAINE

Paul. I'm your friend.

PAUL

Yes. Yes you are.

PAUL

I ever tell you I was a prison

guard during the depression?

ELAINE

You've mentioned it.

PAUL

Did I mention I was in charge of

death row? That I supervised all

the executions?

PAUL

They usually call death row the

Last Mile, but we called ours the

Green Mile, because the floor was

the color of faded limes. We had

the electric chair then. Old

Sparky, we called it.

(beat)

I've lived a lot of years, Ellie,

but 1935 takes the prize. That was

the year I had the worst urinary

infection of my life. That was

also the year of John Coffey, and

the two dead girls...

FADE TO BLACK

"The Two Dead Girls"

CUT TO:

BRUTAL

Paul? Prisoner.

PAUL (O.S.)

Christ. Gimme a minute.

BRUTAL

You all right in there?

PAUL (O.S.)

For a man pissing razor blades.

BRUTAL

You should'a took the day off,

gone to see the doctor.

PAUL

With a new arrival? You know

better. Besides, it's not as bad

as it was. I think it's clearing

up.

DEL

New boy coming in, boss?

PAUL

Never you mind, Del, you just keep

your nose quietly on your business.

BRUTAL

Damn, they're riding on the axle.

What'd they do, bust the springs?

BRUTAL

Paul? You might wanna reconsider

getting in the cell with this guy?

PAUL

Why's that?

BRUTAL

He's enormous.

PAUL

Can't be bigger than you.

PERCY

Dead man walking! Dead man walking

here!

PAUL

Jeezus, pleeze-us, what the hell's

he yelling about?

PERCY

Dead man walking!

PERCY

Dead man walking! Dead man--

PAUL

Percy, that's enough.

BRUTAL

You sure you wanna be in there

with him?

PAUL

(looks to Coffey)

Am I gonna have trouble with you,

big boy?

PAUL

Percy. They're moving house over

in the infirmary. Why don't you go

see if they could use some help?

PERCY

They got all the men they need.

PAUL

Why don't you just go make sure?

(off his look)

I don't care where you go, Percy,

as long as it's not here at this

very moment.

DEL

OWW, GOD, HE BUS' MY FINGERS!

PERCY

Wiped that grin off your shitpoke

face, didn't I

PAUL

Goddamn it, Percy! Get the hell

off my block!

DEL

Oww, damn, boss, he done bus' my

fingers for true...

PAUL

We'll get it looked at, Del, now

keep yourself quiet like I said!

PAUL

If I let Harry take those chains

off you, you gonna be nice?

PAUL

Your name is John Coffey.

COFFEY

(deep and quiet)

Yes, sir, boss, like the drink,

only not spelt the same.

PAUL

So you can spell, can you?

PAUL

My name is Paul Edgecomb. If I'm

not here, you can ask for Mr.

Terwilliger, Mr. Howell, or Mr.

Stanton...those gentlemen there.

(beat)

This isn't like the rest of the

prison. It's a quiet place, we

like to keep it that way.

COFFEY

It weren't me making all the

noise, boss.

PAUL

(eyes narrowing)

You having a joke on me, John

Coffey?

COFFEY

No, sir.

PAUL

Your time here can be easy or

hard, depends on you. If you

behave, you get to walk in the

exercise yard every day.

We might even play some music on

the radio from time to time.

Questions?

COFFEY

Do you leave a light on after

bedtime?

COFFEY

Because I get a little scared in

the dark sometimes. If it's a

strange place.

PAUL

It's pretty bright in here all

night long. We keep half the

lights burning in the corridor.

COFFEY

Cor'der.

PAUL

Right out there.

COFFEY

Couldn't help it, boss. I tried to

take it back, but it was too late.

PAUL

Dean, run Delacroix up to the

infirmary and see if his fingers

are broken.

BRUTAL

Course they're broken, I heard the

damn bones crack. Goddamn Percy.

HARRY

You hear what he was yelling when

we brought the big dummy in?

PAUL

How could I miss it, Harry? The

whole prison heard.

BRUTAL

You'll probably have to answer for

sending him off the Mile. He's

gonna cause you trouble over this,

you mark me.

PAUL

I'll chew that food when I have

to. Right now I wanna hear about

the new inmate...aside from how

big he is, okay?

BRUTAL

(smiles)

Monstrous big. Damn.

PAUL

Seems meek enough. Looks like they

sent us an imbecile to execute.

HARRY

Imbecile or not, he deserves to

fry for what he done. Here...

HARRY

...make your blood curdle.

CUT TO:

KLAUS

WHAT? GOD SAKES, WHAT?

MARJORIE

THE GIRLS! THE GIRLS ARE GONE!

HOWIE

Papa! Papa, look! The blood!

KLAUS

Oh my God.

KLAUS

GODDAMN IT, WOMAN, GET ON THE

PHONE NOW! YOU TELL 'EM WE HEADED

WEST! MIND WHAT I'M SAYING! WEST,

Y'HEAR?

MARJORIE

Central! Central, are you on the

line? Oh, God, please, somebody

took my little girls...

McGEE

I WANT ALL THE WEAPONS UNLOADED,

Y'HEAR? TAKE OUT YOUR SHELLS, I

WON'T HAVE A MAN SHOT BY ACCIDENT

TODAY! BOBO, WHERE THEM DOGS?

KLAUS

Oh, Lord, this belongs to my

Katie...

PAUL

Jesus.

McGEE

Mister.

McGEE

Mister? Can you hear me?

(Coffey nods)

You have a name?

COFFEY

John Coffey. Like the drink, only

not spelt the same.

McGEE

What happened here, John Coffey?

You want to tell me that?

COFFEY

I couldn't help it. I tried to

take it back, but it was too late.

McGEE

(pause)

Boy, you are under arrest for

murder.

HAL

I interrupt?

PAUL

I'm just about done.

PAUL

How's that pretty gal of yours?

HAL

Melinda's not so well, Paul. Not

so well at all. Got laid up with

another headache yesterday. Worst

one yet. She's also developed this

weakness in her right hand.

PAUL

Doctor still think it's migraines?

HAL

I'll be taking her up to Indianola

next day or so for some tests. Had

X-rays and the like. She is scared

to death. Truth to tell, so am I.

PAUL

If it's something they can see

with an X-ray, maybe it's

something they can fix.

HAL

Maybe.

HAL

This just came in. D.O.E. on

Bitterbuck.

PAUL

You didn't come all the way down

here just to hand me a D.O.E.

HAL

No. I had an angry call from the

state capital about twenty minutes

ago. Is it true you ordered Percy

Wetmore off the block.

PAUL

It is.

HAL

I'm sure you had reason, but like

it or not, the wife of the

governor of this state has only

one nephew, and his name happens

to be Percy Wetmore. I need to

tell you how this lays out?

PAUL

Little Percy called his aunt and

squealed like a schoolroom sissy.

(Hal nods)

He also mention he assaulted a

prisoner this morning out of sheer

petulance? Broke three fingers on

Eduard Delacroix's left hand.

HAL

I didn't hear that part. I'm sure

she didn't either.

PAUL

The man is mean, careless, and

stupid. Bad combination in a place

like this. Sooner or later, he's

gonna get somebody hurt. Or worse.

HAL

You and Brutus Howell will make

sure that doesn't happen.

PAUL

Easy enough to say. We can't watch

him every minute, Hal.

HAL

Stick with it. May not be much

longer. I have it on good

authority that Percy has an

application in at Briar Ridge.

PAUL

The mental hospital?

HAL

(nods)

Administration job. Better pay.

PAUL

Then why's he still here? He could

get that application pushed

through...hell, with his

connections, he could have any

state job he wants.

PAUL

Tell you what I think. I think he

just wants to see one cook up

close.

HAL

Well, he'll get his chance then,

won't he? Maybe then he'll be

satisfied and move on. In the

meantime, you'll keep the peace.

PAUL

Of course.

HAL

Thank you, Paul.

PAUL

You give Melinda my love, okay? I

bet that X-ray turns out to be

nothing at all.

DISSOLVE TO:

JAN

Paul?

PAUL

Hey, you. Music too loud?

JAN

No. There's just this big empty

spot in the bed where my husband

usually sleeps.

PAUL

He said to tell you he's having a

little trouble with that tonight.

JAN

Worried about Melinda and Hal? Is

that what's got you up?

PAUL

Yeah, that. Things.

JAN

Things.

PAUL

Got a new inmate today. Big,

simple-minded fella.

JAN

Do I want to hear what he did?

PAUL

No. One sleepless member of this

family's enough.

(softly)

The things that happen in this

world. It's a wonder God allows it.

JAN

Why don't you come to bed? I've

got something to help you sleep,

and you can have all you want.

PAUL

Don't I wish. I've still got

something wrong with my

waterworks, I don't want to pass

it on.

JAN

You see Doc Sadler yet?

PAUL

No, because he'll want me to take

sulfa tablets and I'll spend the

rest of the week puking in every

corner of my office. It'll run its

course all by itself, thank you

very much for your concern.

JAN

Poor old guy...

DISSOLVE TO:

BRUTAL (O.S.)

Paul? Dean?

BRUTAL

I guess the legislature loosened

those purse-strings enough to hire

on a new guard.

(off their looks)

Look again. He's right there.

PAUL

He's doing a cell check.

DEAN

It ain't normal for a mouse to

come up on people that way. Maybe

it's rabid.

BRUTAL

Oh, my Christ. The big mouse

expert. The Mouse Man. You see it

foaming at the mouth, Mouse Man?

DEAN

(dubious)

I don't see its mouth at all.

DEAN

Aw, Brutal, no! We'll be hip-deep

in mice around here...

BRUTAL

(to Paul)

I just wanna see what he'll do. In

the interests of science, like.

DEAN

He's in the damn restraint room.

You know he's gonna be chewing the

padding out of walls and making

himself a nice little nest.

PAUL

All right. Let's get the damn

mouse.

COFFEY

Saw me a mouse go by.

PAUL

It was a dream. Go back to sleep.

COFFEY

Weren't no dream. It was a mouse

all right.

PAUL

Can't put anything over on you.

PAUL

Dean, watch the door. He tries to

get past you, whack him.

DEAN

Brutal or the mouse?

BRUTAL

Har har, Mouse Man.

DISSOLVE:

PAUL

You let him get past you.

DEAN

No I didn't, I was here all the

time!

BRUTAL

Then where the hell is he?

BRUTAL

Three grown men. Outsmarted by a

mouse.

DEAN

Well, bright side is, all this

commotion probably scared him off

for good.

PAUL

Yeah, that's right. That's the

last we'll see of him...

FADE TO BLACK

"The Mouse on the Mile"

CUT TO:

PAUL

You little son of a bitch.

HARRY

Well, I'll be damned. There he is,

big as Billy-be-frigged. I thought

Brutal was pulling my leg.

BILL

That's a goddamn mouse.

HARRY

Yeah. Brute said he was in here

last night begging for food, came

right up to the desk.

BILL

My ass. Give him some room, Percy,

see what he does.

HARRY

Brave little bastard, gotta give

him that.

BILL

Here, lemme try.

BILL

Maybe he's full.

HARRY

(grins)

Maybe he knows you're just a

floater. Gotta be an E Block

regular to feed the E Block mouse,

don'cha know...

HARRY

I was just kidding ab--

PERCY

FUCK!

PERCY

I'M GONNA RIP YOUR DISEASED HEAD

OFF, YOU LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT!

HARRY

Percy met your mouse.

PERCY

It's in here somewhere! I'm gonna

squish the little son of a bitch!

BRUTAL

Percy, we already tried that--

PERCY

What? Whad'ja say?

BRUTAL

I said--

BRUTAL

--uh, knock yourself out. Hope you

nail the bastard.

DISSOLVE:

BRUTAL

Gosh. Ain't in there, huh? Don't

that beat the mousie band?

PAUL

Percy. You want to think about

what you were doing just now.

PERCY

(turns, glaring)

I know what I was doing. Trying to

get the mouse. You blind?

HARRY

You also scared the living crap

out of me and Bill. And them.

PERCY

So what? They aren't in cradle-

school, case you didn't notice...

(directed at Paul)

...although you treat them that

way half the time.

BRUTAL

We don't scare 'em any more than

we have to, Percy. They're under

enough strain as it is.

PAUL

Men under strain can snap. Hurt

themselves. Hurt others. That's

why our job is talking, not

yelling. You'll do better to think

of this place like an intensive

care ward in a hospital--

PERCY

I think of it as a bucket of piss

to drown rats in. That's all.

(scans their faces)

Anybody doesn't like it can kiss

my ass. How's that sit?

PERCY

Try it. You'll be on the bread

lines before the week is out.

PAUL

We all know who your connections

are, Percy...

(steps close)

...but you ever threaten a man on

this block again, we're all gonna

have a go. Job be damned.

PERCY

Big talk. You done?

PAUL

Get all this shit back in the

restraint room. You're cluttering

up my Mile.

DISSOLVE TO:

COFFEY

Saw me a mouse go by.

FADE TO:

PAUL

Arlen? Your daughter and her

family are here.

PAUL

Let's move. I want at least two

rehearsals before he gets back.

TOOT

Sittin' down, sittin' down,

rehearsing now! Everybody settle!

PAUL

Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

TOOT

I'm steppin' forward, I'm steppin'

forward, I'm steppin' forward...

PAUL

Is his head properly shaved?

DEAN

No, it's dandruffy and it smells.

PAUL

I'll take that for a yes. All

right, Arlen, let's go.

TOOT

I'm walkin' the Mile, I'm walkin'

the Mile, I'm walkin' the Mile...

TOOT

I'm prayin', I'm prayin', I'm

prayin'. The Lord is my shepherd,

so on an' so forth...

PAUL

Toot, you have to wait till I tell

you to pray.

(Toot waits)

Okay, pray.

TOOT

Still prayin', still prayin'...

HARRY

Paul, we're not gonna have some

Cherokee medicine man in here

whoopin' and hollerin' and shaking

his dick, are we?

PAUL

Well, actually--

TOOT

Still prayin', prayin', gettin'

right with Jesus...

HARRY

Do it quietly, you old gink!

PAUL

As I was saying, I don't believe

they actually shake their dicks,

Harry. Be that as it may, Mr.

Bitterbuck is a Christian, so we

got Reverend Schuster coming in.

DEAN

Oh, he's good. Fast, too. Doesn't

get 'em worked up.

PAUL

On your feet, Toot. You've prayed

enough for one day.

TOOT

Gettin' to my feet, walkin' again,

walkin' on the Green Mile...

PERCY

What do I do?

PAUL

Watch and learn.

TOOT

Sittin' down, sittin' down, takin'

a seat in Old Sparky's lap...

TOOT

Gettin' clamped, gettin' clamped,

gettin'--ow, shit, watch the skin!

BRUTAL

Roll on one.

VAN HAY

"Roll on one" means I turn the

generator up full. You'll see the

lights go brighter in half the

prison...

BRUTAL

Arlen Bitterbuck, you have been

condemned to die by a jury of your

peers, sentence imposed by a judge

in good standing in this state.

Do you have anything to say before

the sentence is carried out?

TOOT

(gleefully)

Yeah! I want a fried chicken

dinner with gravy on the taters,

I want to shit in your hat, and I

got to have Mae West sit on my

face, because I am one horny

motherfucker!

PAUL

Shut up, Brutal. That goes for

everybody. I want quiet in here.

(turns)

Toot, another remark like that,

I'll have Van Hay roll on two for

real.

BRUTAL

(beat, gently)

It was pretty funny.

PAUL

That's why I don't like it.

Tomorrow night we're doing this

for real. I don't want somebody

remembering a stupid joke like

that and getting going again.

(off their looks)

Ever try not laughing in church

once something funny gets stuck in

your head. Same goddamn thing.

BRUTAL

Sorry, Paul. You're right. Let's

keep going. Harry...

PERCY

What's with the sponge?

VAN HAY

You soak it in brine, get it good

and wet. Conducts the electricity

directly to the brain, fast like

a bullet. You don't ever want to

throw the switch on a man without

that.

BRUTAL

Arlen Bitterbuck, electricity

shall now be passed through your

body until you are dead, in

accordance with the state law. God

have mercy on your soul.

(to Van Hay)

Roll on two.

VAN HAY

And that's that.

TOOT

Now I'm fryin'! Fryin'! Geeaaah!

Fryin' like a done tom turkey!

BRUTAL

One of the witnesses showed up a

day early.

PAUL

All right, let's go again and do

it right this time! Get that idiot

out of the chair...

DISSOLVE TO:

BITTERBUCK

You think if a man sincerely

repents on what he done wrong, he

might get to go back to the time

that was happiest for him and live

there forever? Could that be what

heaven is like?

PAUL

I just about believe that very

thing.

BITTERBUCK

Had me a young wife when I was

eighteen. Spent our first summer

in the mountains. Made love every

night. She'd just lie there after,

bare-breasted in the firelight,

and we'd talk sometimes till the

sun come up.

(beat)

That was my best time.

PAUL

It'll be fine. You'll do fine.

BRUTAL

Roll on two.

BRUTAL

Again.

CUT TO:

PERCY

Adios, Chief. Drop us a card from

hell, let us know if it's hot

enough.

BRUTAL

He's paid what he's owed. He's

square with the house again, so

keep your goddamn hands off him.

PERCY

What's up his ass?

PAUL

You, Percy. Always you.

PERCY

You gotta hate the new boy? That

the way it is around here?

PAUL

(turns back)

Why not just move on? Go to Briar

Ridge.

(off his look)

Yeah, I know about it. Sounds like

a good job.

PERCY

I might take it, too. Soon as you

put me out front.

PERCY

You heard me. I want Brutal's spot

for the next execution.

PAUL

(beat)

What's with you? Seeing a man die

isn't enough? You gotta be close

enough to smell his nuts cook?

PERCY

I wanna be out front, is all. Just

one time. Then you'll be rid of me.

PAUL

If I say no?

PERCY

I might just stick around for

good, make me a career of this.

FADE TO:

COFFEY

Del?

PAUL

Delacroix? That you?

PAUL

You are not gonna believe this.

DEL

Look! I done tame me dat mouse!

PAUL

We see that.

DEL

Watch dis! Watch what he do!

DEL

Ain't he sumpthin now? Ain't Mr.

Jingles smart?

PAUL

Mr. Jingles?

DEL

Dat his name. He whisper it in my

ear. Cap'n, can I have a box for

my mouse so he can sleep in here

wi' me?

PAUL

I notice your English gets better

when you want something.

DEL

Wanna see what else he can do?

Watch, watch, watch...

DEL

We play fetch, Mr. Jingles? We

play fetch?

DEL

He fetch it ever' time. Smart as

hell, ain't he? We do da trick

again, watch, watch, watch...

BRUTAL

Who's training who here?

COFFEY

That's some smart mouse, Del. Like

he's a circus mouse or something.

DEL

A circus mouse! Dat jus' what he

is, too! A circus mouse! I get

outta here, he make me rich, see

if he don't!

PERCY

Well, well. Looks like you found

yourself a new friend, Eddie.

DEL

Don' hurt him, 'kay? 'kay?

PERCY

That the one I chased?

PAUL

(level)

Yes, that's the one. Only Del says

his name is Mr. Jingles.

PERCY

Is that so?

PAUL

Del was just asking for a box. He

thinks the mouse will sleep in it,

I guess. That he might keep it for

a pet. What do you think?

PERCY

I think it'll shit up his nose

some night and run away, but I

guess that's Del's lookout.

(beat)

We oughtta find a cigar box. Get

some cotton batting from he

dispensary to line it with. That

should do real nice.

PAUL

Man said get a cigar box.

CUT TO:

PAUL

Hal? You wanted to see me?

HAL

Yeah. Paul. Close the door.

HAL

Uh. So you know. You got a new

prisoner coming in tomorrow.

William Wharton. Young kid. Wild

as hell, judging from this...

HAL

...been rambling all over the

state last few years, causing all

kinds of trouble. Finally hit big

time. Killed three people in a

holdup, including a pregnant

woman. Got "Billy the Kid"

tattooed on his left arm...bad

news all around...

PAUL

Hal?

HAL

It's a tumor, Paul. A brain tumor.

HAL

They got X-ray pictures of it.

It's the size of a lemon, they

said, and way down deep inside

where they can't operate. They say

she'll be dead by Christmas. I

haven't told her. I can't think

how. For the life of me, Paul, I

can't think how to tell my wife

she's going to die.

CUT TO:

PAUL

...oh God...oh God...

FADE TO BLACK

"Coffey's Hands"

CUT TO:

PAUL

I'm going.

JAN

What?

PAUL

To the doctor. I'm going.

(off her look)

Today. Just as soon as we get the

new inmate squares away.

JAN

That bad?

PAUL

Oh yeah.

CUT TO:

HARRY

Boy's doped to the gills. Dean,

hand me them clothes...

HARRY

William Wharton! Hey! I'm talking

to you! Put these clothes on!

PERCY

Hellraiser, huh? Looks more like

a limp noodle to me. Hey! Hey, you!

PERCY

You been declared competent! Know

what that means? Mean's you're

gonna ride the lightning, son!

PERCY

Bzzzzzzzzt-zap! Just like that!

How's it feel to know you're gonna

die with your knees bent?

DEAN

C'mon, Percy, give us a hand.

CUT TO:

DEL

Don' look so good, boss. Look like

you runnin' you a fever.

COFFEY (O.S.)

Boss Edgecomb? Needs ta see you

down here, boss.

PAUL

Got things to tend to just now,

John Coffey. You be still in your

cell now, y'hear?

COFFEY

Careful.

COFFEY

Careful. Careful.

BILLY

Yeeeeeeehaaaawwwwwwrooooo!

BILLY

WHOOOEE, BOYS! AIN'T THIS A PARTY,

NOW? IS IT, OR WHAT?

PAUL

LET HIM GO!

BILLY

G'WAN, SHOOT! SEE WHO YA HIT!

PAUL

HIT HIM, PERCY! GODDAMN IT, HIT

HIM!

BILLY

C'MON, PERCY, HIT ME! HIT ME, YOU

LIMP NOODLE, HIT ME! YEEHAWWW!

BILLY

Big fucker. Snuck up on me. No

fair.

BRUTAL

Breathe...breathe...that's it...

HARRY

We thought he was doped.

(to Percy)

Didn't we? Didn't we all of us

think he was doped?

PAUL

You didn't ask? I guess that's not

a mistake you'll be need to make

again anytime soon, is it?

PAUL

Grab his arms! You too, Percy!

(off Percy's

hesitation)

Percy, goddamn it, get your feet

out of cement and help us out here!

PAUL

Get Dean looked at right away,

make sure he's all right.

Percy, you go make a report to the

warden for me. Start off by saying

the situation is under control--

it's not a story, he won't

appreciate you drawing out the

suspense.

BRUTAL

What about you? You look about

ready to collapse.

PAUL

I've got the Mile till you all get

back. Go on now.

COFFEY (O.S.)

Boss? Needs ta see ya down here.

PAUL

This is not a good time, John

Coffey. Not a good time at all.

COFFEY (O.S.)

But I needs ta see ya, boss. I

needs ta talk t'ya.

COFFEY

Closer.

PAUL

I'm alone here right now, John.

Figure this is close enough.

COFFEY

Boss, please. I got to whisper in

your ear.

DEL

Boss? You know you not s'pose to

do dat.

PAUL

Mind your business, Del. What do

you want, John Coffey?

COFFEY

Just to help.

PAUL

(stunned, frozen)

What are you...doing?

DEL

HELP! JOHN COFFEY'S KILLING BOSS

EDGECOMB! HELP!

PAUL

Del, Chrissake, settle down, I'm

fine...

PAUL

John? John, what's wrong?

PAUL

What did you do, big boy? What did

you do to me?

COFFEY

I helped it. Didn't I help it?

PAUL

Yes, but...how?

COFFEY

Just took it back, is all. Awful

tired now, boss. Dog tired.

DEL

What dat man do to you? He throw

some gris-gris on you?

(off Paul's look)

You look diff'int! Even walk

diff'int. Like y'all better!

PAUL

You're imagining thing. Lie down,

Del. Get you some rest.

CUT TO:

JAN

Hi, honey. How are you feeling?

PAUL

Um...not too bad.

JAN

What did the doctor say?

PAUL

Oh, you know doctors. Gobble-de-

gook mostly.

JAN

Paul? What are you doing?

PAUL

What's it feel like?

JAN

I know what it feels like...it

feels great...but...Paul...

JAN

Those must've been some pills.

FADE TO:

JAN

Paul? Not that I'm complaining.

But we haven't gone four times in

one night since we were nineteen.

(off his look)

You wanna tell me just what the

hell's going on?

PAUL

Well...thing is...I never actually

got to the doctor yesterday...

CUT TO:

PAUL

Brutal? Listen...I'm thinking of

taking the morning off sick. You

cover the fort for me?

(beat)

That's swell. Thanks. Yeah, I'm

sure I'll feel better. Okay.

JAN

You sure you ought to do this?

PAUL

I'm not sure what I'm sure of.

CUT TO:

CYNTHIA

I offer you a cold drink?

PAUL

Yes, ma'am, a cold drink would be

fine. Thank you.

PAUL

Mr. Hammersmith. Your office said

I'd find you at home today. I hope

I'm not troubling you.

BURT

That depends, Mr.--?

PAUL

Paul Edgecomb. I'm the E Block

superintendant at Cold Mountain.

BURT

The Green Mile. I've heard of it.

Lost a few clients your way.

PAUL

That's why I'm here. I'd like to

ask you about one of them.

BURT

Which client? Now you got my

curiosity aroused.

PAUL

John Coffey.

BURT

Ah, Coffey. He causing you

problems?

PAUL

No, can't say he is. He doesn't

like the dark. He cries on

occasion. Other than that...

BURT

Cries, does he? Well, he's got a

lot to cry about, I'd say. You

know what he did.

PAUL

(nods)

I read the court transcripts.

PAUL

Thank you, Missus.

CYNTHIA

My pleasure. Kids! Lunch is about

ready! Y'all come on up!

BURT

What exactly are you trying to

find out? Satisfy my curiosity,

I'll see if I can satisfy yours.

PAUL

I've wondered if he ever did

anything like that before.

BURT

Why? Has he said anything?

PAUL

No. But a man who does a thing

like that has often developed a

taste for it over time. Occurred

to me it might be easy enough to

follow his backtrail and find out.

A man his size, and colored to

boot, can't be that hard to trace.

BURT

You'd think so, but you'd be

wrong. Believe me, we tried. It's

like he dropped out of the sky.

PAUL

How do you explain that?

BURT

We're in a Depression. A third of

the country's out of work.

People are drifting by the

thousands, looking for work,

looking for that greener grass.

Even a giant like Coffey wouldn't

get noticed everywhere he goes...

not until he kills a couple of

little girls.

PAUL

He's...strange, I admit. But there

doesn't seem to be any real

violence in him. I know violent

men, Mr. Hammersmith. I deal with

'em day in and day out.

BURT

You didn't come up here to ask me

whether he might have killed

before. You came up here to see if

I think he did it at all. That's

it, isn't it?

PAUL

Do you?

BURT

One seldom sees a less ambiguous

case. He was found with the

victims in his arms. Blurted out

a confession right then and there.

PAUL

Yet you defended him.

BURT

Everyone is entitled to a defense.

CYNTHIA

Kids! Lunch!

BURT

Y'all listen to your Momma, now!

BURT

Tell you something. You listen

close, too, because it might be

something you need to know.

PAUL

I'm listening.

BURT

We had us a dog. No particular

breed, but gentle. Ready to lick

your hand or fetch a stick. Just

a sweet mongrel, you know the kind.

(Paul nods)

In many way, a good mongrel dog is

like you negro. You get to know

it, and often you get to love it.

It is of no particular use, but

you keep it around because you

think it loves you. If you're

lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you never

have to find out any different. My

wife and I were not so lucky.

Caleb. Come here for a second.

BURT

Please, son.

BURT

He has the one eye. I suppose he's

lucky not to be blind. We get down

on our knees and thank God for

that much at least. Right Caleb?

(the boy nods shyly)

Okay, go on in now.

BURT

That dog attacked my boy for no

reason. Just got it into his mind

one day. Same with John Coffey. He

was sorry afterwards, of that I

have no doubt...but those little

girls stayed raped and murdered

nonetheless. Maybe he's never done

it before--my dog never bit

before, but I didn't concern

myself with that. I went out there

with my rifle and grabbed his

collar and blew his brains out.

PAUL

I'm sorry for your trouble.

BURT

I'm as enlightened as the next

man, Mr. Edgecomb. I would not

bring back slavery for all the tea

in China. I believe we have to be

humane and generous in our efforts

to solve the race problem. But we

have to remember that the negro

will bite if he gets the chance,

just like a mongrel dog will bite

if it crosses its mind to do so.

(beat)

Is Coffey guilty? Yes, he is.

Don't you doubt it, and don't you

turn your back on him. You might

get away with it once or even a

hundred times...but in the end...

BURT

You understand?

BURT

I'm gonna have to tear that old

doghouse down one of these days.

CUT TO:

PAUL

No, it's not for you.

DEL

Oh. Oh my.

COFFEY

I'm smelling me some cornbread.

PAUL

It's from my missus. She wanted to

thank you.

COFFEY

Thank me for what?

PAUL

You know. For helping me.

COFFEY

Helping you with what?

COFFEY

Ohhh.

(beat)

Was your missus pleased?

PAUL

Several times.

COFFEY

This all for me?

DEL

Oh my. John, I can smell it from

here. I surely can.

COFFEY

(looks to Paul)

Can I give some to Del?

PAUL

It's yours, John. You do with it

as you please.

COFFEY

Here's for Del and Mr. Jingles

then.

BILLY

Hey! What about me? I'm'a get some

PAUL

It's yours, John. As you please.

COFFEY

Well. Fine. I think I'll keep the

rest, then.

PAUL

Courtesy of the gentleman across

the way.

DEL

Oh, John. So very fine of you. So

very kind. Mr. Jingles t'ank you.

COFFEY

(mouth full)

...wel'cm...

BILLY

Hey! What about me? Don't you hold

out on me, ya big dummy nigger!

PAUL

You'll keep a civil tongue on my

block.

PAUL

You get that one for free. But

that's the last one.

BILLY

That's it? Just that little bitty

one? Guess I'll have to pay out

for the rest, huh?

DISSOLVE TO:

BILLY

Yeehaaw! Good shot, weren't it?

Oh, the look on your face!

HARRY

You believe this? Son of a bitch

pissed on me!

BILLY

Hey, d'jall like that? I'm

PAUL

We've been looking to clear that

TIMECUT:

BILLY

Hey! Whassit now, movin' day?

Y'all wanna come in and dust a

BILLY

You can come in here on your legs,

(motions to Brutal)

C'mon, fuckstick. No sneakin' up

on me this time. We'll go man to

man, see who's the better fel--

PAUL

C'mon, Wild Bill. Little walky

walky.

BILLY

Don't you call me that! Wild Bill

Hickock wasn't no range rider! He

was just a bushwackin' John Law!

Dumb sonovabitch sat with his back

to the door and kilt by a drunk!

BRUTAL

Oh, my suds and body! A history

lesson! You just never know what

you're gonna get when you come to

work everyday on the Green Mile.

Thank you, Wild Bill.

BILLY

Oh, not in there! C'mon now, I'll

be good! Honest Injun I will! No!

No! Ummmmhhhh...urg...ah!

HARRY

Holy Christ, he's pitchin' a fit!

PAUL

He'll be fine, boys. Trust me on

this one.

BILLY

ALL I WANTED ME WAS A LITTLE

CORNBREAD, YOU MUTHERFUCKERS!

FADE TO:

Hope your bags are packed.

TIMECUT:

PAUL

The Moon Pie thing was pretty

original. Gotta give him that.

FADE TO:

PAUL

Del, grab your things. Big day for

you and Mr. Jingles.

DEL

Whatchoo talkin' bout?

PAUL

Important folks heard about your

mouse, wanna see him perform. Not

just guards, either. One of them's

a politician all the way from the

state capital, I believe.

DEL

You fellas comin'?

HARRY

We got other fish to fry just now,

Del, but you knock 'em for a loop.

COFFEY

You knock 'em for a loop like Mr.

Harry says, Del.

PAUL

Let's move along briskly, folks.

There's not much time.

TOOT

I'm sittin' down, I'm sittin'

down, I'm sittin' down.

EARL

Been sweepin' floors here ten

years, never had to wear no damn

tie before.

BILL

You're a V.I.P. today, Earl, so

just shut up.

DEL

Messieurs et mesdames! Bienvenue

PERCY

Roll on two.

VAN HAY

That's that.

PAUL

Very good. Very professional.

PAUL

Well?

DEL

They love Mr. Jingles! They laugh

and cheer and clap they hands!

PERCY

Well, that's just aces. Pop back

BRUTAL

Percy, you shit.

PERCY

Del! Hey, you numb wit, I didn't

BILLY

Ain't you sweet. Soft. Like a

BRUTAL

PERCY

You talk about this to anyone,

I'll get you all fired. I swear

PAUL

What happens on the Mile, stays on

PERCY

You keep laughing, you French-

laughing.

FADE TO BLACK

"The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix"

CUT TO:

PAUL

What about Dean? He's got a little

boy would love a pet mouse, I bet.

DEL

How could a boy be trust wid Mr.

Jingles? Maybe forget to feed him.

And how he keep up wid his

trainin', just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

PAUL

All right, I'll take him.

DEL

T'ank you kindly, merci beaucoup,

but you live out in the woods, and

Mr. Jingles, he be scared to live

out dans la foret.

PAUL

He whisper that in your ear?

BRUTAL

How about Mouseville?

DEL

Mouseville?

BRUTAL

Tourist attraction down in

Florida. Tallahassee, I think. Is

that right, Paul? Tallahassee?

PAUL

(level)

Yeah, that's right. Tallahassee.

Just down the road apiece from the

dog university.

BRUTAL

You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?

You think he's got the stuff?

PAUL

Might. He's pretty smart.

DEL

Hey! What dis Mouseville?

BRUTAL

Tourist attraction, I said. They

got this big tent you go into--

DEL

Like a cirque? You have to pay?

BRUTAL

You shittin' me? Course you pay.

Dime a piece, two cents for the

kids. And inside the tent there's

this mouse city made out of boxes

and toilet paper rolls...

BRUTAL

...plus they got the Mouseville

All-Star Circus. There's mice that

swing on trapeze, mice that roll

barrels, mice that stack coins...

DEL

Dat's it! Dat's da place for Mr.

Jingles! You gonna be a circus

mouse after all! Gonna live in a

mouse city down in Florida!

BRUTAL

Percy, no!

PERCY

Knew I'd get him sooner or later.

Just a matter of time, really.

COFFEY

Give'm to me.

COFFEY

Give'm to me. Might still be time.

BRUTAL

What are you doing?

BRUTAL

Paul, what the hell--

DEL

Please, John. Oh Johnny, help him,

please help him, s'il vous plait.

BRUTAL

(softly)

Oh, dear Jesus. The tail. Look at

the tail.

DEAN

What did you do?

COFFEY

I helped Del's mouse. He a circus

mouse. Goan live in a mouse city

down in...down in...

BRUTAL

(numb)

Florida?

COFFEY

Boss Percy's bad. He mean. He step

on Del's mouse.

(softly)

I took it back, though.

PAUL

Brute, come along with me.

(to Harry and Dean)

You fellas go on back to you

cribbage game.

PERCY

Don't start in on me. It was just

a mouse. Never belonged here in

the first place.

PAUL

The mouse is fine. Just fine.

You're no better at mouse-killing

than anything else around here.

PERCY

You expect me to believe that? I

heard the goddamn thing crunch.

PAUL

Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is

okay? After all our talks about

how we should keep the prisoners

calm? Aren't you relieved?

PERCY

What kind of game is this?

PAUL

No game. See for yourself.

PERCY

You switched them! You switched

them somehow, you bastards!

BRUTAL

I always keep a spare mouse in my

wallet for occasions such as this.

PERCY

You're playing with me, the both

of you! Just who the hell do you

think you are--

PAUL

We're the people you work with,

Percy, but not for long. I want

your word.

PERCY

My word?

PAUL

I put you out front for Del, you

put in your transfer to Briar

Ridge the very next day.

PERCY

What if I just call up certain

people and tell them you're

harassing me? Bullying me?

PAUL

Go ahead. I promise you'll leave

your share of blood on the floor.

PERCY

Over a mouse? You think anyone's

gonna give two shits?

PAUL

No. But four men will swear you

stood by while Wild Bill tried to

strangle Dean to death. About that

people will care, Percy. Even your

uncle the governor will care.

BRUTAL

Thing like that goes in your work

record. Work record can follow a

man around a long, long time.

PAUL

I put you out front, you put in

your transfer. That's the deal.

PAUL

You make a promise to a man, you

shake his hand.

DISSOLVE TO:

DEL

Hey, boys. Say hi, Mr. Jingles.

PAUL

Eduard Delacroix, will you step

forward?

DEL

Boss Edgecomb?

PAUL

Yes, Del?

DEL

Don' let nothin' happen to Mr.

Jingles, okay?

DEL

Here, take him.

PAUL

Del. I can't have a mouse on my

shoulder while...you know.

COFFEY

I'll take him, boss. Jus' for now.

If Del don' mind.

DEL

Yeah, you take 'im, John. Take him

til' dis foolishment done--bien!

(to Paul and Brutal)

After, you take him down to

Florida? To dat Mouseville?

BRUTAL

We'll do it together, most likely.

Maybe take a little vacation time.

DEL

People pay a dime apiece to see

him. Two cents for the kiddies.

Ain't dat right, Boss Howell?

BRUTAL

That's right, Del.

DEL

You a good man, Boss Howell. You

too, Boss Edgecomb. Wish I could'a

met you bot' someplace else.

DEL

Au revoir, mon ami. Je t'aime, mon

petit.

FAT LADY

Hope he's good and scared. Hope he

knows the fires are stoked, and

that Satan's imps are waiting.

PERCY

Roll on one.

COFFEY

You be still, Mr. Jingles. You be

so quiet and so still.

PERCY

Eduard Delacroix, you have been

condemned to die by a jury of your

peers, sentence imposed by a judge

in good standing in this state.

You have anything to say before

sentence is carried out?

DEL

I sorry for what I do. I give

anything to take it back, but I

can't. God have mercy on me.

(whispers to Paul)

Don' forget 'bout Mouseville.

PERCY

No such place. That's just a fairy

tale these guys told you to keep

you quiet. Just thought you should

know, faggot.

PERCY

Electricity shall now be passed

through your body until you are

dead, in accordance with state

law. God have mercy on your soul.

PERCY

Roll on two.

PAUL

It's dry!

PAUL

JACK!

BRUTAL

Don't you tell him to stop. Don't

you do it. It's too late for that.

BILLY

HE'S COOKIN' NOW! THEY COOKIN' HIM

GOOD! NEAR ABOUT DONE, I RECKON!

WITNESSES

What the hell's happening to

him?...Are those clamps going to

hold?...Christ, the smell!...Is

this normal?

VAN HAY

SHOULD I KILL THE JUICE?

PAUL

NO! ROLL, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, ROLL!

PAUL

No water! No water! You crazy?

FAT LADY

Stop it, stop it, oh can't you see

he's had enough?

HAL

Why don't you shut it down?

PAUL

He's still alive! You want me to

shut down while he's still alive?

PAUL

You watch, you son of a bitch!

PAUL

Kill it!

BRUTAL

You do it. You're running the

show, ain't you?

HAL

It's all right, folks, it's all

under control. Just a power surge

from the storm, that's all,

nothing to worry about...

PAUL

Dean, get doc's stethoscope.

MAN

Oh my God! Is it always like this?

Why didn't somebody tell me? I

never would have come!

CUT TO:

PERCY

I didn't know the sponge was

supposed to be wet--

PAUL

Brutal, no!

BRUTAL

What do you mean, no? How can you

say no? You saw what he did!

PAUL

Delacroix's dead, nothing can

change that, and Percy's not worth

it!

BRUTAL

So he just gets away with it? Is

that how it works?

HAL

What the fuck was that? Jesus

Christ, three witnesses puked all

over the floor up there! And the

smell! I got Van Hay to open both

doors, but that smell won't come

out for five damn years, that's

what I'm betting! And that asshole

Wharton is singing about it! I can

hear him!

PAUL

(quietly)

Can he carry a tune, Hal?

HAL

Okay, boys. Okay. Now what the

hell happened?

HAL

Percy? Something to say?

PERCY

I didn't know the sponge was

supposed to be wet.

HAL

How many years you spend pissing

on the toilet seat before somebody

told you to put it up?

PAUL

Percy fucked up, Hal. Pure and

simple.

HAL

Is that your official position?

PAUL

Don't you think it should be?

PAUL

He'll be putting in a transfer

request to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

Moving on to bigger and better

things. Isn't that right, Percy?

HAL

You're a little asshole, and I

don't like you a bit.

(off Percy's look)

Have that transfer request on my

desk first thing.

BILLY

(singing)

Barbecue! Me and you! Stinky,

pinky, phew-phew-phew! Weren't

Billy or Jilly or Hilly or Roy--it

was a French-fried faggot named

Delacroix!

PAUL

You're about ten seconds away from

spending the rest of your life in

the padded room.

COFFEY

Poor Del. Poor old Del.

PAUL

Yes. Poor old Del. John, are you

okay?

COFFEY

I could feel it from here.

PAUL

What do you mean? You could hear

it? Is that what you mean?

COFFEY

He's out of it now, though. He's

the lucky one. No matter how it

happened, Del's the lucky one.

PAUL

Where's Mr. Jingles?

COFFEY

(points vaguely)

Ran down there. Don't think he'll

be back.

(beat)

Awful tired now, boss. Dog tired.

PAUL

Me too, John. Me too.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

PAUL

I hate this.

JAN

I know.

DISSOLVE:

HAL

She's having one of her good days.

I thank God for that.

PAUL

What a bad day?

HAL

(beat)

Sometimes she's...not herself

anymore. She swears.

PAUL

Swears.

HAL

It just pops out, the most awful

language you can imagine. She

doesn't even know she's doing it.

I didn't know she'd ever heard

words like that...and to hear her

say them in her sweet voice...

(gazes off)

I'm glad she's having a good day,

Paul. I'm glad for you and Jan.

DISSOLVE TO:

JAN

Honey? If you don't say what's on

your mind, I'm afraid I'll have to

smother you with a pillow.

PAUL

I'm thinking I love you. I'm

thinking I don't know what I'd do

if you were gone.

JAN

Oh.

PAUL

(beat)

I'm also thinking I'd like to have

the boys over tomorrow.

CUT TO:

THE MEN

(various, ad-lib)

Ma'am, you sure know how to fry up

some fine chicken...Brutal, don't

hog the taters now...Try that corn

yet? It's something special...

PAUL

You saw what he did with the mouse.

BRUTAL

I could'a gone the rest of the day

without you bringing that up.

DEAN

I could'a gone the rest of the

year.

PAUL

He did it to me too. He put his

hands on me and took my bladder

infection away.

JAN

When he came home, he was...all

better.

DEAN

You're talking about an authentic

healing. A praise-Jesus miracle.

PAUL

I am.

BRUTAL

If you say it, I accept it. But

what's it got to do with us?

JAN

Melinda? Oh, Paul...

BRUTAL

Melinda? Melinda Moores?

JAN

You really think you can help her?

PAUL

It's not a bladder infection, or

even a busted-up mouse. But there

might be a chance.

HARRY

Hold on now. You're talking about

our jobs. Sneak a sick woman onto

a cellblock?

PAUL

Hal would never allow that. You

know him, he wouldn't believe

something unless it fell on him.

BRUTAL

So you're talking about taking

John Coffey to her. That's more

than just our jobs, Paul.

DEAN

Damn right. That's prison time if

we get caught.

HARRY

Let's not discuss this like it's

even an option. Brutal, help me

out here...

BRUTAL

I'm sure she's a fine woman...

JAN

The finest.

PAUL

What's happening to her is an

offense, Brutal. To the eyes and

the ears and the heart.

BRUTAL

I have no doubt. But we don't know

her like you and Jan do...do we?

PAUL

That's why it's a lot to ask.

HARRY

It is. Let's not forget Coffey's

a murderer. What if he escapes?

I'd hate losing my job or going to

prison, but I'd hate having a dead

child on my conscience even more.

PAUL

I don't think that'll happen...

(beat, softly)

...in fact, I don't think he did

it at all.

PAUL

I just can't see God putting a

gift like that in the hands of a

man who would kill a child.

DEAN

Well, that's a tender notion, but

the man's on death row for the

crime. Plus, he's huge. If he

tried to get away, it'd take a lot

of bullets to stop him.

BRUTAL

We'd all have shotguns in addition

to sidearms. I'd insist on that.

(to Paul)

He tried anything, we'd have to

take him down. You understand.

PAUL

I understand.

BRUTAL

(beat)

So. Tell us what you had in mind.

FADE TO BLACK

CUT TO:

BRUTAL

I was never here.

ORDERLY

Shit, for five bucks, you was

BRUTAL

Fellas thirsty? Fresh out of the

icebox.

DEAN

Oh, thanks. That's swell.

HARRY

Yeah, hot in here.

BILLY

Hey. Hey, I'm'a get some too.

BRUTAL

My ass you get some too.

PAUL

You think you deserve any?

HARRY

(checks a clipboard)

Day report says he's been okay.

BILLY

Hell, yes, I been behaved. C'mon,

now, don't be stingy hogs.

PAUL

You gonna stay behaved?

BILLY

C'mon, you clunk, gimme that.

PAUL

You promise me, or I'll drink it

myself right here in front of you.

BILLY

C'mon now, don't be that way. I be

good.

PAUL

Cup.

BILLY

We'll break out the fire hose and

take it anyway. And you will have

drunk your last R.C. cola. Unless

they serve 'em down in hell.

DISSOLVE:

PAUL

Anybody wants to back out, now's

the time. After this, there's no

turning back.

(off their looks)

So? We gonna do this?

COFFEY

Sure. I'd like to take a ride.

BRUTAL

(to Paul)

Guess were all in.

PERCY

What is this?

PAUL

Payback.

PERCY

Let go of me! Let go!

PAUL

Settle down, Percy!

BRUTAL

Oooo, Poicy! What would your

mother say?

PERCY

Let go, you ignoramus! I know

people! Big people!

PAUL

So you've said. C'mon, stick out

your arms like a good boy.

PERCY

I won't. And you can't make me.

BRUTAL

You're dead wrong about that, you

know.

BRUTAL

You gonna put your arms up? I'll

rip your ears off. Use 'em for tea

caddies. You know I will.

PAUL

The man's ripping your ears off,

Percy. I'd do as he says.

PERCY

Please, Paul. Don't put me in with

Wild Bill. Please.

PAUL

You would think that.

BRUTAL

You'll get 'em back, don't worry.

PERCY

That's more than I can say about

your jobs. All your jobs! You

can't do this to me! You can't!

PAUL

Let you in on a little secret. We

can and we are.

PAUL

You're going to have a few hours

of quiet time now, so you can

reflect on what you did to Del.

BRUTAL

(grins)

If you get lonely, think about

Olive Oyl...

(thrusting his hips)

...uk-uk-uk-uk!

PAUL

One more time--what do you say if

somebody comes by?

DEAN

Coffey got upset, so we put him in

the restraint room. They hear any

noise, they'll think it's him.

COFFEY

We goan for the ride now?

PAUL

That's right.

PAUL

What about us?

DEAN

You're over in Admin, going over

Del's file. Brutal and Harry are

in the laundry doing their wash--

BILLY

(slurring wildly)

Where you fink you're goin'?

COFFEY

You're a bad man.

BILLY

S'right, nigger. Bad as you'd want.

BILLY

Whooeee. Whole room's spinning.

Like I'm shit-ass drunk. I have me

some shine or what?

BILLY

Niggers oughtta have they own

'lectric chair. White man oughtn't

havta sit in no nigger 'lectric

chair, nossir...

COFFEY

He's a bad man.

COFFEY

They're still in there. Pieces of

them, still in there. I hear them

screaming.

PAUL

John, come along! Right now,

y'hear? C'mon! Toward that door!

PAUL

Lie down on this.

(off Coffey's look)

It'll be easier for you and no

harder for us.

COFFEY

Say. This is fun.

COFFEY

Look, boss! It's Cassie, the lady

in the rocking chair!

PAUL

Shhh. John, you have to be quiet

now.

COFFEY

(whispering)

You see her? You see the lady?

BRUTAL

We see her, John.

PAUL

C'mon, big boy, keep moving.

BRUTAL

How far is it?

HARRY

Just up ahead...

COFFEY

Hey there, little firefly. Where's

Mrs. Firefly this evening?

COFFEY

Oh, there you is. You come out to

play too?

PAUL

They seem...drawn to you.

COFFEY

I love 'em, is why. They don't

think no hurtful thoughts. They's

just happy to be. Happy little

lightning bugs...

PAUL

C'mon, big boy. Upsy-daisy.

PAUL

John? Do you know where we're

taking you?

COFFEY

Help a lady?

PAUL

That's right. Help a lady. But how

did you know?

COFFEY

Dunno. Tell the truth, boss, I

don't know much'a anything. Never

have.

COFFEY

Bye, fireflies. Bye.

DISSOLVE TO:

BRUTAL

We can still turn back.

COFFEY

Boss, look. Someone's up.

BRUTAL

This is a mistake. Christ, Paul,

what were we thinking?

PAUL

Too late now. Harry, keep John

here until we call you.

HAL

Who the hell goes there at two-

thirty in the goddamn morning?

PAUL

Hal, it's us! It's Paul and

Brutal--it's us!

HAL

Paul, what are you doing here at

this hour? Jesus, it's not a

lockdown, is it? Or a riot?

PAUL

Hal, God's sakes, take your finger

off the trigger...

HAL

Are you hostages? Who's out there?

Who's by that truck?

HAL

John Coffey! Halt! Halt right

there or I shoot!

MELINDA (O.S.)

Hal? Who are you talking to, you

fucking cocksucker?

PAUL

No one's hurt. We're here to help.

HAL

Help what? I don't understand. Is

this a prison break?

PAUL

I can't explain what it is. You

just have to trust me.

HAL

What do you...want?

MELINDA

Hal! Make them go away! No

salesmen in the middle of the

night! No Fuller brushes! No

French knickers with come in the

crotch! Tell them to take a flying

fuck in a rolling d...d...

COFFEY

(a whisper)

Just to help. Just to help, boss,

that's all.

HAL

You can't. No one can.

HAL

Don't you go up there! Don't you

do it!

COFFEY

Boss, you just be quiet now and

let me be.

MELINDA (O.S.)

Stay out of here! Whoever you are,

just stay out! I'm not dressed for

visitors, you rat's asshole!

MELINDA

Oh, so big! Pull down your pants!

Let's have a look!

MELINDA

Don't come near me, pigfucker.

MELINDA

Why do you have so many scars? Who

hurt you so badly?

COFFEY

Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

MELINDA

What's your name?

COFFEY

John Coffey, ma'am. Like the

drink, only not spelt the same.

COFFEY

Ma'am?

MELINDA

Yes, John Coffey?

COFFEY

I see it. I see it.

COFFEY

You be still now. You be so quiet

and so still.

BRUTAL

John! Sick it up! Cough 'em out

like you done before!

BRUTAL

He's choking! Whatever he sucked

out of her, he's choking on it!

MELINDA

How did I get here? We were going

to the hospital in Indianola,

weren't we? We stopped and you

bought me a packet of posies...

HAL

Shhh. It doesn't matter. It

doesn't matter anymore.

MELINDA

Did I have the X-ray? Did I

PAUL

Yes.

PAUL

It was clear. There was no tumor.

MELINDA

Who is that man?

PAUL

John? Can you turn around? Can you

turn around and see this lady?

MELINDA

What's your name?

COFFEY

John Coffey, ma'am.

MELINDA

Like the drink, only not spelled

the same.

COFFEY

No, ma'am. Not spelt the same at

all.

HAL

Melly, no...

MELINDA

I dreamed of you. I dreamed you

were wandering in the dark, and so

was I. We found each other. We

found each other in the dark.

MELINDA

It's St. Christopher. I want you

to have it, Mr. Coffey, and wear

it. He'll keep you safe. Please

wear it for me.

COFFEY

Thank you, ma'am.

MELINDA

Thank you, John.

PAUL

C'mon, John, stay on your feet.

HARRY

Christ, he goes down, we'll need

three mules and a crane to pick

him up again...

BRUTAL

He'll never sit in Old Sparky. You

know that, don't you?

(off Paul's look)

He swallowed that stuff for a

reason. I give him a few days. One

of us'll be doing a cell check and

there he'll be. Dead on his bunk.

PAUL

If that's his choice, he's earned

it.

(beat)

Let's get him back on the Mile.

FADE TO BLACK

"Coffey on the Mile"

CUT TO:

DEAN

Am I glad to see you! You were

gone so long! Wild Bill's making

noises like he's gonna wake up...

(notices Coffey)

What the hell's wrong with him?

BRUTAL

He's hurting, Dean. Hurting bad.

PAUL

John, we're gonna set you on your

bunk now. Ready?

DEAN

What about Mrs. Moores? Was it

like the mouse? Was it a...you

know...a miracle?

PAUL

Yes. Yes it was.

HARRY

Damn. I think we got away with it.

BRUTAL

We still gotta convince a certain

somebody to keep his trap shut.

PAUL

Get his stuff.

PAUL

I want to talk, not shout. I take

the tape off, you gonna be calm.

BRUTAL

My mother always said if you do it

fast, it won't hurt so much.

BRUTAL

I guess she was wrong.

PERCY

Get me out of this nut-coat.

PAUL

In a minute.

PERCY

Now! Now! Right n--

PAUL

You shut up and listen. You

deserved to be punished for what

you did to Del. You'll accept it

like a man, or we'll make you

sorry you were ever born. We'll

tell people how you sabotaged

Del's execution--

PERCY

Sabotaged!

PAUL

--and how you pissed yourself like

a frightened little girl. Yes,

we'll talk, that's a given--but,

Percy, mind me now...we'll also

see you beaten within an inch of

your life.

PAUL

We know people, too, are you so

foolish you don't realize that?

People with friends and loved ones

doing time in this prison. People

who'd be happy to amputate you

nose or your penis just so someone

they care about could get an extra

three hours in the exercise yard

every week.

(off Percy's look)

Let bygones be bygones. Nothing's

hurt so far but your pride...and

nobody need ever know about that

except the people in this room.

BRUTAL

What happens on the Mile, stays on

the Mile. Always has.

PERCY

May I be let out of this coat now?

PERCY

My things?

PAUL

Think it over, Percy.

PERCY

Oh, I intend to. I intend to think

about it very hard. Starting right

now.

BRUTAL

He'll talk. Sooner or later.

PAUL

Easy, easy. You all right?

BILLY

What'a you looking at, you limp

noodle? You wanna kiss my ass or

suck my dick?

DEAN

Oh God, oh God, no...

COFFEY

Punished them bad men.

PAUL

Why Wild Bill? Why?

COFFEY

I saw in his heart. When he grab

my arm, I saw what Wild Billy

done. Saw plain as day. Can't hide

what's in your heart.

PAUL

What? Saw what?

COFFEY

Take my hand, boss. You see for

yourself.

BRUTAL

Paul, no!

COFFEY

My hand.

PAUL

No...please...

COFFEY

Gots to, boss. Gots to give you a

little bit of myself. A gift,

like. A gift of what's in me so

you can see...

BILLY

You lover your sister? You make

any noise, know what happens? I'll

kill her instead of you.

(to Cora)

And if you make any noise, I'll

kill her.

COFFEY

He kill 'em with they love. They

love for each other. You see how

it is?

COFFEY

That's how it is ever' day. That's

how it is all over the worl'...

CUT TO:

DEAN

...well, I dunno, he just snapped,

I guess...

HARRY

...s'right, one minute he's fine,

the next--blammo...

BRUTAL

...bastard grabbed him through the

bars a few days back, scared the

boy so bad he wet himself...

COP #1

Son! Son! Can you hear me?

COP #2

Speak up if you can hear us! We

gotta ask you some questions!

MEDIC

I think this boy's cheese slid off

his cracker.

HAL

I'll cover you as much as I can,

even if it mean my job, but I have

to know. Does this have anything

to do with what happened at my

house? Does it, Paul?

PAUL

No.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

PAUL

It makes sense. I read the file.

Hal even said it himself. Wharton

rambled all over the state last

few years, causing trouble. Hell,

longer than that. Been at it since

he was ten. Vandalism. Petty

theft. Setting fires.

JAN

You saw him. You actually saw this

Wild Bill person take those girls.

PAUL

Their father hired him on for a

few days last spring, help repair

the barn. Cheap labor, just

another drifter...

BRUTAL

Only not.

PAUL

Sick bastard came back a month

later, just before dawn. Took the

girls...did what he did. Coffey

found them afterwards and tried to

help. It was too late.

JAN

(absorbs this)

Then you can stop it. The

execution, I mean. Get Coffey a

new trial.

PAUL

Based on what, honey? Some kind of

magical vision I had?

JAN

Show this farmer--what's his name,

Detterick?--show him a picture of

Wild Bill.

(off their looks)

Why not? If Wharton was there...if

the farmer can identify his

picture and they know he was

there...

BRUTAL

Him being there in May doesn't

mean he came back and killed those

girls in June. Even if he was

committing other crimes.

PAUL

They got their killer as far as

they're concerned.

Hell, Coffey's own lawyer would

come throw the switch if we let

him.

JAN

Then lie.

PAUL

Lie? About what?

JAN

Tell them Wharton confessed to the

crime. Brutus, you can back him

up, say you heard it too. You can

say that's what set Percy off. He

shot Wharton because he couldn't

stand thinking of what happened to

those two little girls, it snapped

his mind...

(seeing their looks)

...what? What now?

DEAN

We never reported anything like

that. We would've, too, everybody

knows it. It's part of our job.

BRUTAL

Besides, confessing don't make it

so. Slugs like Wild Bill lie about

everything. Crimes they committed,

women they had, even the weather.

JAN

But he was there! He painted their

barn! He ate dinner with them!

PAUL

All the more reason he might take

credit for the crime. He's gonna

fry anyway, so why not boast?

JAN

All right. Then you've got to get

John Coffey out on your own.

HARRY

Ma'am?

JAN

You did it once, didn't you? Only

this time, don't bring him back.

DEAN

Ma'am, your son's grown up and

moved away. My kids are just

starting kindergarten. Will you be

the one to explain to them why

their daddy's in prison?

JAN

Work out a plan. Make it look like

a real escape.

HARRY

Better be a plan an imbecile could

dream up. Nobody'd believe it

otherwise.

BRUTAL

Even if we did think of something,

it wouldn't do any good.

JAN

Why not? Just why the hell not?

PAUL

Because he's a six-foot-eight-inch

baldheaded black man with barely

enough brains to feed himself. How

long you think it'd be before he

was recaptured? Two hours? Six?

JAN

Do you mean to kill him, you

cowards? Do you?

JAN

Don't touch me! Next week this

time you'll be a murderer, no

better than that man Wharton, so

don't touch me!

DISSOLVE TO:

JAN

I'm so sorry I called you a

coward. I feel worse about that

than anything I've ever said to

you in our whole marriage.

PAUL

Even that time we went camping and

you called me Old Stinky Sam?

JAN

Does Hal know? That Coffey's

innocent, I mean?

(Paul shakes his head)

Can he help? Does he have the

influence to do something about

this?

PAUL

No.

JAN

Then don't tell him. If he can't

help, don't tell him. Ever.

PAUL

I won't.

JAN

(beat)

There's no way out of this for

you, is there?

PAUL

No. I've been thinking about it,

too, believe me.

(beat)

Tell you the truth, honey. I've

done some things in my life I'm

not proud of, but this is the

first time I've ever felt in real

danger of hell.

JAN

Hell? Oh Paul...

(touches his face)

Talk to him. Talk to John. Find

out what he wants.

CUT TO:

COFFEY

Hello, boss.

PAUL

Hello, John.

PAUL

I guess you know we're coming down

to it now. Another couple of days.

(beat)

Is there anything special you'd

like for dinner that night? We can

rustle you up most anything.

COFFEY

Meatloaf be nice. Mashed taters

with gravy. Okra, maybe. I's not

picky.

PAUL

What about a preacher? Someone you

could say a little prayer with?

COFFEY

Don't want no preacher. You can

say a prayer, if you want. I could

get kneebound with you, I guess.

PAUL

Me?

PAUL

S'pose I could, if it came to that.

PAUL

John, I have to ask you something

very important right now.

COFFEY

I know what you gonna say. You

don' have to say it.

PAUL

I do. I do have to.

(beat)

John, tell me what you want me to

do. You want me to take you out of

here? Just let you run away? See

how far you can get?

COFFEY

Why would you do such a foolish

thing?

PAUL

On the day of my judgement, when

I stand before God, and He asks me

why did I kill one of his true

miracles, what am I gonna say?

That is was my job? My job?

COFFEY

You tell God the Father it was a

kindness you done.

(takes his hand)

I know you hurtin' and worryin',

I can feel it on you, but you

oughtta quit on it now. Because I

want it over and done. I do.

COFFEY

I'm tired, boss. Tired of bein' on

the road, lonely as a sparrow in

the rain. Tired of not ever having

me a buddy to be with, or tell me

where we's coming from or going

to, or why. Mostly I'm tired of

people being ugly to each other.

I'm tired of all the pain I feel

and hear in the world ever' day.

There's too much of it. It's like

pieces of glass in my head all the

time. Can you understand?

PAUL

Yes, John. I think I can.

BRUTAL

There must be something we can do

for you, John. There must be

something you want.

COFFEY

I ain't never seen me a flicker

show.

COFFEY

I be all right, fellas. This

here's the hard part. I be all

right in a little while.

PAUL

John, I should have that just for

now. I'll give it back after.

COFFEY

You know, I fell asleep this

afternoon and had me a dream. I

dreamed about Del's mouse.

PAUL

Did you, John?

COFFEY

I dreamed he got down to that

place Boss Howell talked about,

that Mouseville place. I dreamed

there was kids, and how they

laughed at his tricks! My!

COFFEY

I dreamed those two little blonde-

headed girls were there. They 'us

laughing, too. I put my arms

around 'em and sat 'em on my

knees, and there 'us no blood

comin' outta their hair and they

'us fine. We all watch Mr. Jingles

roll that spool, and how we did

laugh. Fit to bus', we was.

PAUL

What should we pray for, John?

COFFEY

Strength?

PAUL

God, please help us finish what

we've started, and please welcome

this man, John Coffey--like the

drink, but not spelled the same--

into heaven and give him peace.

Please help us to see him off the

best we can and let nothing go

wrong. Amen.

COFFEY

I know a prayer I once heard. Can

I say it?

PAUL

You go right ahead, John. Take all

the time you need.

COFFEY

Baby Jesus, meek and mild, pray

for me...

KATHE AND CORA

...and every child. Be my

strength, be my friend...

COFFEY

...be with me until the end. Amen.

MARJORIE

Die slow, you bastard.

COFFEY

They's a lot of folks here hate

me. A lot. I can feel it. Like

bees stinging me. It hurts.

BRUTAL

Feel how we feel, then. We don't

hate you--can you feel that?

MARJORIE

Kill him twice, you boys! You go

on and kill that raping baby-

killer twice, that'd be fine!

PAUL

Wipe you face before you stand up,

Dean.

PAUL

Roll on one.

MARJORIE

Does it hurt yet? I hope it does!

I hope it hurts like hell!

PAUL

John Coffey...you have been

condemned to die in the electric

chair by a jury of your

peers...sentence imposed by a

judge in good standing in this

state. Do you have anything to say

before sentence is carried out?

COFFEY

I'm sorry for what I am.

MARJORIE

You ought to be! Oh, you monster,

you damn well ought to be!

COFFEY

Please, boss, don't put that thing

over my face. Don't put me in the

dark, I's afraid of the dark.

PAUL

All right, John.

COFFEY

...heaven...I'm in heaven...

heaven...heaven...heaven...

BRUTAL

(whispers)

Paul. You have to say it. You have

to give the order.

worl'...

Roll on two.

That was the last execution I ever

took part in. Just couldn't do it

anymore after that. Brutal either.

We both transferred out, took jobs

with Boys' Correctional.

That was all right. Catch 'em

young, that became my motto. Might

even have done some good.

PAUL

You don't believe me.

ELAINE

I don't imagine you would lie to

me, Paul. It's just that...

PAUL

...It's quite a story.

ELAINE

Yes. Quite a story.

(pause)

One thing I don't understand. You

said you and Jan had a grownup son

in 1935. Is that right?

(Paul nods)

But if that's true...

PAUL

The math doesn't work, does it?

PAUL

You feel up to a walk?

There. It's in there.

Scary? No. Not really.

Hey. Wake up, old boy. Wake up.

Paul? It isn't...it can't be...

That can't be Mr. Jingles.

Don't hurt him, okay? Okay?

BRAD

It's a goddamn mouse, y'old fool,

they carry all kind'a disease...

BRAD

PAUL

You leave him alone, Percy! You

leave him alone, or by God I'll--

BRAD

Who you calling Percy? Name's

Brad, you senile fucker. And I'm

gonna nail that mouse, you can

take that to the everfucking bank.

ELAINE

How dare you? Get out!

BRAD

Piss off, you wrinkeldy old bitch.

Me and Paulie are talking.

ELAINE

His name is Mr. Edgecomb. If you

ever call him Paulie again, your

days of employment at Georgia

Pines will end.

BRAD

Who the hell you think you are?

ELAINE

I am the grandmother of the man

who is currently Speaker of the

Georgia House of Representatives.

A man who loves his relatives, Mr.

Dolan. All it would take is a

phone call.

ELAINE

At first I thought I'd let you be.

I'm old, and that seemed easiest.

But when my friends are threatened

and abused, I do not let it be.

(icy beat)

Now get out, or you won't work

another day here. Not another

hour. I swear it.

BRAD

Don't know what you're getting so

het up about. Just a damn mouse.

ELAINE

Get out, you ignorant man. What

little mind you have is ugly and

misdirected.

BRAD

Don't bother coming back here

tomorrow...Mr. Edgecomb Gonna be

a new lock on this door. This is

off-limits to residents, no matter

what Mrs. My Shit Don't Stink has

to say about it.

Little trick I learned from Percy

Wetmore.

Is your grandson really Speaker of

the House?

ELAINE

He is.

PAUL

You gonna thank the lady? She just

saved your old mousie hide.

PAUL

I think Mr. Jingles happened by

accident. I think when we

electrocuted Del, and it all went

so badly...well, John could feel

it, you know...and I think a tiny

part of whatever was inside of him

just leapt out...

(beat)

Me, I was no accident. John had to

give me a little part of

himself...a gift, like...so I

could see for myself what Wild

Bill had done. When John did that,

a part of whatever power worked

through him spilled into me.

ELAINE

He...what? Infected you with life?

PAUL

That's as good a word as any. He

infected us both, didn't he, Mr.

Jingles. With life.

(beat)

I'm a hundred and five years old,

Elaine. I was forty the year John

Coffey walked the Green Mile.

ELAINE

...oh my God...

PAUL

I haven't even had a cold since

1935. I've had to watch my friends

and loved ones die off through the

years...Hal and Melinda...Brutus

Howell...my wife...my son...

(beat)

...and you, Elaine. You'd die,

too, and my curse is knowing I'll

be there to see it...

DISSOLVE TO:

PAUL (V.O.)

...that's my punishment, you see?

My punishment for letting John

Coffey ride the lightning...for

killing a miracle of God...

PAUL (V.O.)

...you'll be gone, like all the

others, and I'll have to stay...

PAUL (V.O.)

I'll die eventually, I imagine. I

have no illusions of immortality.

But I will have wished for death

long before death finds me.

PAUL (V.O.)

In truth, I wish for it already.

PAUL

Mr. Jingles?

PAUL

Where you been, boy? I've been

worried about you. You hungry?

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

PAUL (V.O.)

I lie in bed most nights, thinking

about it. And I wait...

DISSOLVE TO:

PAUL (V.O.)

I think about all the people I've

loved, now long gone.

I think about my beautiful Jan,

and how I lost her so many years

ago. I think about all of us

walking our own Green Mile, each

in our own time. But one thought,

more than any other, keeps me

awake most nights...

(beat)

...if he could make a mouse live

so long, how much longer do I have?

PAUL (V.O.)

We each owe a death, there are no

exceptions, but sometimes, oh God,

the Green Mile is so long...
