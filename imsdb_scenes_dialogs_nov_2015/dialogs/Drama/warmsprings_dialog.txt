FADE IN:

EXT. A BODY OF WATER - LATE AFTERNOON

1                                                                 1

A glimpse of sunlight desperately tries to force its way

through a gray sky before being obliterated.

4

A MAN, sunburned and bearded, lets himself fall from the edge

of a boat and into the ocean.

D

UNDERWATER, through shafts of light, white limbs are

FLAILING. The MAN struggles, alone. Bubbles stream upward.

He breaks the surface and gasps for air.

He begins to swim. His massive arms and shoulders grab at the

tide in large, hard strokes. His legs and feet are buried

beneath the dark ocean water.

EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

A floating tenement.

A crane LOWERS a fishing net into the water. The MAN swims

into it. The net is RAISED as he lays, motionless, within its

grip.

EXT. BOAT DECK - CONTINUOUS                                   3

The crane swings around with the MAN in the net.

He is EMPTIED out onto the deck like a fish.

AHIVERING on the rotting wooden planks he FLIPS himself over

on his stomach. Slowly, using the palms of his hands, he

DRAGS his trunk and withered limbs across the deck in a

labored lobster-walk.

He uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge

of the boat. They dangle like pieces of rope, his feet white

and flaccid.

A towel, a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to

him by a CREW PERSON. He pours himself a generous amount of

scotch and begins drinking.

ISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT                                      4

The same MAN is illuminated by the light of a single candle.

He is dancing, holding on tightly to a WOMAN.

2.

Though the light is dim it is clear that he is clean shaven,

with his hair neatly trimmed.

Their connection is powerful and alive. They stop dancing,

overwhelmed with mutual desire.

He holds the WOMAN's face in his hands and KISSES it all

over, moving into a realm of feeling that is foreign to him.

He kisses her passionately on the mouth.

MAN

Oh, my dear...

His fingers run softly over the outside of her breasts. She

begins to undo the back of her dress and slips it down around

her ankles. Wearing only her tight corset she brings his

hands to the laces and together they undo it.

WOMAN

(whispering softly)

It's all right, darling. It's all

right.

INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

5                                                                    5

OSCAR, a manservant, is carrying both a silver tray and a

pair of pants over his extended arm.

A VOICE (O.S.)

Oscar! Where the devil are you?

Deftly, Oscar opens the door to a spacious bedroom.

OSCAR

My apologies, Mr. Roosevelt.

INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

6                                                                    6

There with his bare legs, muscular and lean, sporting black

socks held up with garters is FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, 39.

He projects a natural elegance and the confidence of a man

who can have anything he wants.

Right now... he wants his pants.

FRANKLIN

I've been standing here for five minutes.

Oscar offers the tray to Franklin which bear cuff links and a

Tiffany watch which Franklin grabs.

3.

OSCAR

Did you sleep well, sir?

FRANKLIN

Don't remember. That's good, isn't it?

OSCAR

Yes, sir.

Franklin takes his pants from Oscar and steps into them,

pulling the suspenders up and over his shoulders.

7                                                                   7

INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING

Striding into the dining room, Franklin lifts a silver lid

off a breakfast plate. He dismisses it and instead pours

himself a cup of coffee from a silver pot on the sideboard.

He overhears a voice from the nearby sitting room.

WOMAN (O.S.)

I could not be more delighted to have

received your most charming letter.

It has been far too long since we last

corresponded. However, it is with

great reluctance I must decline your

kind speaking invitation...

8

INT. SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, 34, is dictating a letter. Her enormous

eyes, liquid and blue, reveal a woman of extraordinary

intelligence and depth.

ELEANOR

Unfortunately, I would be of little

assistance to the Junior Assistance

League. Particularly if my purpose

were to appear as an alumna who is

gifted at public speaking.

She is dictating to LUCY MERCER, 27, deeply feminine with a

head of soft dark hair and an accommodating nature. She is

Eleanor's social secretary and closest friend.

She is also the WOMAN dancing with Franklin the night before.

LUCY

And what do you really want me to say?

ELEANOR

Thank you and if you ask again I

shall scream?

4.

They share a laugh -- which is not shared by the homely

rumpled mess of a man draped over a sofa in the corner.

LOUIS

Why don't you ask your husband for

some pointers? He's a pretty gifted

public speaker, don't you think?

LOUIS HOWE, 48, is a wizened man of limited stature and

unlimited soul. Franklin's political advisor extraordinaire --

part consiglieri and part priest. He is the mastermind behind

what he believes will be the greatest political career of the

twentieth century.

He gets up and leans in closely to Eleanor. A cigarette dangles

off his lip and the smoke rises up and curls in her face.

LOUIS

You should get out once in a while.

Accepting that invitation would be

good for Franklin's career.

ELEANOR

Mr. Howe, wouldn't you be more

comfortable waiting for my husband

outside?

LOUIS

In the street, Mrs. Roosevelt?

ELEANOR

If you like.

Eleanor smiles oh-so politely at Louis, as Franklin enters

from the dining room.

FRANKLIN

I see it's not even eight a.m.

and already the gloves are off.

(kissing Eleanor on the

cheek)

Good morning, Babs. Hello, Miss

Mercer.   L

UCY

Good morning, sir.

Quickly, she lowers her eyes to her work.

LOUIS

(annoyed)

You're late. Honestly, why do you

enjoy keeping people waiting?

5.

FRANKLIN

Because they always seem more

grateful to see me when I arrive.

He leans in and kisses Eleanor on the cheek.

FRANKLIN

Have a lovely day, Babs.

ELEANOR

Should I expect you for dinner?

FRANKLIN

I have the Navy reception this

evening. I'll be home quite late.

Unless you've changed your mind

about coming?

Louis looks up from his paper at Lucy who is writing

furiously.

ELEANOR

Do you wish me to come?

FRANKLIN

Well... whatever you'd like.

ELEANOR

(a beat)

Thank you, no.

FRANKLIN

Very well then.

(tipping his hat)

Good day, Miss Mercer.

Lucy nods and Franklin exits. Then Louis tips his hat to the

ladies and follows him out.

EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. SIDEWALK - DAY

9                                                                    9

A car pulls over and Franklin is first out, followed by

Louis, walking at a brisk pace as they cross the opposite

side of the street. Louis struggles to keep up while

consulting a small appointment book.

LOUIS

At ten you've got a meeting with

representatives from Pittsburgh

Steel. Their bid on the ship

building contract has already been

turned in and is on your desk for

approval.

6.

FRANKLIN

What did I think of it?

An AFRICAN-AMERICAN man steps off the curb, letting Franklin

and Louis pass.

LOUIS

You had some problems with it.

FRANKLIN

I better read it. Steel workers

tend to vote democratic. Next.

LOUIS

Lunch with Secretary Daniels.

FRANKLIN

Must I?

LOUIS

He's your boss.

FRANKLIN

Anything else?

LOUIS

(a beat)

What if she'd said yes?

FRANKLIN

Who?

Louis shoots him a look that says "you know who."

LOUIS

People know. It's time to stop.

FRANKLIN

I can handle my own affairs, Louis.

LOUIS

Not this one. This is Washington,

D.C., not the Harvard Club.

(off-put by Franklin's

arrogance)

How can you be so cavalier?

FRANKLIN

You say that like it's a bad thing.

Louis takes a quick last drag on his cigarette and follows

him inside a building.

8.

ELEANOR

I have offered Franklin his freedom.

FRANKLIN

And I have accepted.

SARA

(to Eleanor)

His freedom is not yours to offer!

FRANKLIN

I am in love with Miss Mercer, Mama.

LOUIS

Lord save us from fools in love.

SARA

Falling in love is out of the

question. Why do you think men have

mistresses? Duty. Duty to their

families and their careers.

SARA

Where do you think you're going?

ELEANOR

It's obvious that my input in this

matter is of little importance.

FRANKLIN

Babs!

SARA

Come back here! Both of you!

15                                                                15

E

LEANOR

I don't know whether to hate you

or thank you.

9.

FRANKLIN

For what?

ELEANOR

For forcing me to face my life

honestly for the first time.

FRANKLIN

I didn't mean to hurt you, Babs.

ELEANOR

You never do. You live your life

skimming the surface... never aware

of the attachments beneath.

(finding her anger)

It must be a luxury.

16                                                                16

SARA

Divorce will finish your career in

politics. How do you intend to

support yourself?

FRANKLIN

My trust fund.

SARA

Divorce Eleanor and there is no

trust fund.

LOUIS

We've come so far, boss. State

Assembly, Assistant Secretary of

the Navy -- all pages right out of

Cousin Teddy's play book. We're on

the road to the White House. Don't

do this.

10.

FRANKLIN

(breathless)

I humbly accept your nomination for

Vice-President!

FRANKLIN

They say the best way to get   rid of

a man is to have him run for   Vice-

President.

(he holds for the laugh)

You might well have asked my   cousin

Teddy if that's how they got   rid

of him!

11.

ALICE

Of course you lost. A Roosevelt on

the democratic ticket? Our ancestors

are turning in their graves.

FRANKLIN

Cousin Alice, if Teddy were alive

he'd be a democrat -- and you know it.

ALICE

Rubbish. But I do know one thing:

You're exactly like him. My father

was born wanting only one thing: to

be President.

FRANKLIN

And what's wrong with that?

They both share a laugh.

ALICE

Do you know what they're saying

about you?

Franklin's smile fades.

FRANKLIN

No, but I'm sure you'll tell me.

ALICE

They say F.D.R. stands for

"featherduster." That you're a

lightweight. A dilettante with no

substance; no point of view.

FRANKLIN

Is that what you think?

ALICE

You lead with your vanity. You

talk when you should listen.

Unless these are the qualities of

a democrat?

F

RANKLIN

The democratic party is the party

of the people. I am a man of the

people.

ALICE

Darling, you're a Roosevelt. What

do you know about people?

12.

ALICE

Of course, I can think of one person

you did manage to find the time to

invest in. A Miss Mercer, I believe?

FRANKLIN

Alice, stop.

ALICE

Don't misunderstand me, Franklin.

Being married to Eleanor I think

you deserved some fun. But you made

the right decision. Especially

since Miss Mercer has gone on with

her life.

FRANKLIN

What are you talking about?

ALICE

Edward Rutherford is a wonderful

catch for a girl like her.

FRANKLIN

(stunned)

She's married?

ALICE

Last week. A small event, of course.

FRANKLIN

When I last heard she was governess

to his children.

ALICE

(with a smile)

And then love bloomed. As a "man of

the people," I wouldn't be too hard

on her, Franklin. We can't all have

trust funds you know.

20                                                             20

LOUIS

We're not taking this defeat lying

down, boss. We'll run you for

Governor --

13.

FRANKLIN

(kidding)

Really? Of which state?

Louis shoots him a look.

LOUIS

Very funny. No, this buys you time.

It buys you experience.

FRANKLIN

What about Al Smith?

LOUIS

He's vulnerable. You're still a

fresh face, boss. We'll use that to

our advantage.

They walk down a hill towards some waiting Boy Scouts as the

PHOTOGRAPHER follows them.

FRANKLIN

Boy Scouts, Louis? Hardly my

political base.

LOUIS

They've got parents. Besides

they're photogenic.

Franklin begins glad-handing the assembled group of mostly

underprivileged children.

FRANKLIN

Franklin Roosevelt, happy to

meet you.

Franklin masks his thinly veiled discomfort with an

artificial good cheer. Meanwhile, Louis, in full political

mode, makes sure the L

Photographer gets everything.

OUIS

Over here!

Franklin poses with two Scouts. The picture is taken.

SCOUTMASTER

Okay, boys, lunch. Line up to wash!

(to Franklin)

Will you be joining us?

FRANKLIN

Of course!

14.

FRANKLIN

What's your name, son?

GUISEPPE

Guiseppe.

FRANKLIN

Guiseppe! Come sta, ragazzo?

GUISEPPE

(puzzled)

Okay, I guess.

21                                                                21

LOUIS

He's a natural.

15.

Franklin and Elliot break out from the rest and begin racing

up the lawn. Franklin, no match for his son's speed, loses.

He doubles over, trying to catch his breath.

ELLIOT

Vae victis! ("Woe to the

conquered!")

C

aught up in his victory, Elliot doesn't see Franklin sneak

up behind him and tackle him to the ground.

FRANKLIN

Festina lente! ("Not so fast!")

One by one the other children all pile on top of Franklin and

Elliot.

ELEANOR

Dinner is in one half-hour! Come in

and change, children!

FRANKLIN

Up! Up, chicks! You heard your

mother!

Everyone runs up the porch stairs and into the house except

Franklin.

ELEANOR

Go wash up.

Utterly spent, Franklin lays on the grass, not moving.

LOUIS

Hey, boss! Are you all right?

Slowly, Franklin gets up and walks with great effort up the

porch stairs.

FRANKLIN

I'm fine.

(re: her knitting)

Oh, that's pretty, Babs.

He puts his hand on Eleanor's shoulder and leans in to buss

her cheek but Eleanor quickly stands.

ELEANOR

I must check on dinner.

There is a cursory formality to her words and little warmth.

16.

FRANKLIN

Very well.

LOUIS

Tired?

FRANKLIN

Of you? Never.

LOUIS

Why don't you nap before dinner?

FRANKLIN

Yes, dear.

Not necessarily.

LOUIS

How did he get it?

DOCTOR

Some experts believe it is linked

to contaminated water. But that

theory is speculative at best.

LOUIS

It was the visit to that god damned

Boy Scout Camp!

DOCTOR

In all honesty you need to be

looking forward, not back.

ELEANOR

What is the prognosis?

DR. LOVETT

The damage to his leg muscles is

extensive. I suspect he will be

paralyzed from the waist down.

ELEANOR

Dear God.

And the children?

DR. LOVETT

If they don't have any symptoms by

now then they have been spared.

Sara stands -- her bearing once again erect and proud.

SARA

Then we must count our blessings.

R. LOVETT

You will need to prepare yourselves.

There is a deep depression that

follows an illness of this magnitude.

I'm afraid life as he knew it is over.

Their discussion is suddenly interrupted by the sound of a

child crying. Eleanor rushes off the porch to the bushes.

SARA

Now that politics are out of the

question he can stay here at home

with me.

ELEANOR

But what kind of life is that?

OUIS

I've rented him an office downtown.

He can still practice law.

S

ARA

Why would you want to do that?

LOUIS

Because he needs it.

ELEANOR

He can pursue a career, Mama.

SARA

A man as proud and vital as

Franklin... you're inviting him to

be hurt.

(MORE)

19.

And you, Mr. RA(cont'd)

SA Howe, engaged in the

fantasy of a political future for

my son... is there nothing you

won't do to keep your job?

ELEANOR

Mama! That's not fair!

SARA

What kind of life is it to be

pitied and stared at?

ELEANOR

What kind of life is it to be

hidden away? I know you believe

that what you are suggesting for

Franklin is best. But I think you

are making it harder for him.

SARA

I think I know what's best for

Franklin. I am his mother!

ELEANOR

And I am his wife.

Mr. Roosevelt, we got a storm

comin'!

FRANKLIN

(while peeing)

Leave me here. Let the ocean

swallow me up. Burial at sea.

Perfect for a navy man.

21.

Franklin is slowly wheeled across the restaurant. He shrinks

from the stares of the patrons.

A LITTLE GIRL eating with her parents gets excited when she

sees Franklin's braces and points. Franklin gives her a hard

look and she is hurt.

What he can't see is that under the table she wears a set of

braces like his.

Franklin is wheeled up to his table and EUGENE and STANLEY sit

down with him.

Louis enters resembling a drowned rat. He rips off his hat

and raincoat and puts down his suitcase.

FRANKLIN

(genuinely surprised)

Louis?

LOUIS

I never miss Florida in the rainy

season.

FRANKLIN

No letter? No wire?

LOUIS

Why? Would you have answered it?

FRANKLIN

What the hell are you doing here?

LOUIS

Good to see you too. Nice whiskers.

You look like Chester Arthur.

FRANKLIN

Stanley, this is Mr. Howe. He gets

sea-sick at the mere sight of a

boat so he's probably happy that

it's being Ldestroyed right now.

OUIS

Boys, I need to talk to Mr. Roosevelt

alone. Find your own breakfast. Here's

a five spot. Make it a feast.

They look at the money and take their leave.

FRANKLIN

You're always so generous with my

money.

22.

LOUIS

You mean your mother's, don't you?

The Waitress puts down two cups of coffee. Franklin pulls out

a flask and pours some into his cup. He then lights a

cigarette and begins smoking, but doesn't offer one to Louis.

Without asking, Louis helps himself.

FRANKLIN

So Mama financed this fool's

errand, has she? Well, it's a waste

of a trip.

LOUIS

It was Eleanor's idea.

Franklin's face is immobile.

WAITRESS

What can I get you?

LOUIS

I'd like some ham and eggs, sunny

side up, please?

(to Franklin)

What's your fancy, boss?

FRANKLIN

Nothing. I fancy nothing.

LOUIS

He'll have the same.

The Waitress grabs their menus and scurries away. Louis opens

his briefcase and hands Franklin a stack of mail. Franklin

glances it, but doesn't open any.

LOUIS

There are a few from your children.

FRANKLIN

I can still read.

Franklin flips through the mail and finds a letter that

interests him, opening it.

LOUIS

Your wife wants you to come home.

(choosing his words)

She's concerned. I'm concerned.

This life on a boat... where is it

getting you?

(

F

23.

FRANKLIN

Getting me? For one thing, no one

gets to see me and I don't get to

see them.

LOUIS

Don't say that. Everyone's waiting

for you to come home. The kids...

they're aching to see you.

RANKLIN

(reading)

Really?

Louis looks sadly at his friend.

LOUIS

What's that?

FRANKLIN

skimming the letter)

From George Foster Peabody. He owns

a resort in rural Georgia for

investment purposes. Hot springs or

something. He claims that only

recently a crippled boy swam in the

waters and can walk again.

LOUIS

Oh, for Chrissake...

FRANKLIN

(reading)

"

The high magnesium content of

these natural springs will hold

anyone up. Although it is not a

resort for infirm types I am

extending you my personal

invitation to come visit in the off-

season."

(putting the letter aside)

I'm only welcome in the "off-

season."

Eugene and Stanley approach the table.

EUGENE

Mr. Roosevelt, we got bad news.

FRANKLIN

What?

F

F

24.

STANLEY

It's the boat... it got banged up

real bad tied to the dock.

RANKLIN

How bad?

STANLEY

I don't think you can stay there

anymore.

ranklin absorbs this.

EUGENE

Maybe it's a blessing in disguise,

Mr. Roosevelt. I don't know about

you, but I'm homesick.

FRANKLIN

And I'm sick of home.

(to Louis)

Where's the letter from Peabody?

LOUIS

You can't be serious?

He hands Franklin the letter who rereads it.

FRANKLIN

Why not miracle waters? I've drunk

the oil of monkey glands, been

zapped with electricity and hung

upside down in harnesses. After all

that, this sounds downright

peaceful.

LOUIS

I can't quite picture you in the

back woods of Georgia.

FRANKLIN

Where do you picture me, Louis?

LOUIS

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

FRANKLIN

President, Louis? I can't visit the

bathroom without a team of

associates to help pull my pants

down.

LOUIS

Give it a little time.

RANKLIN

There's a reason they say a man

runs for office.

I'm going to Georgia.

ELEANOR

James has been doing so much better

now that Elliot has joined him at

Groton. They've put their

differences behind them and have

become a real team.

LIONEL

Someone important?

TOM

You might say so, Lionel.

LIONEL

Who?

TOM

A Mr. Roosevelt.

LIONEL

Teddy?

TOM

(patiently)

No, he's dead.

LIONEL

Oh.

STATIONMASTER

Tom, your guest needs some

assistance. We're gonna need some

able-bodied men to move him.

TOM

(to Lionel)

Go over to the livery stable...

LIONEL

... and get the Collier boys.

FRANKLIN

Hello! Hello! Mr. Loyless?

TOM

Tom, Mr. Roosevelt.

FRANKLIN

Then you'd better call me Franklin.

TOM

Franklin.

FRANKLIN

And this is the Misses.

ELEANOR

Call me Eleanor.

TOM

Pleased to make your acquaintance.

ROY

(to Tom)

There's a trunk and a chair with

the wheels, too.

TOM

I'll send a wagon right over.

PETE

We got a wagon, sir.

(covering his discomfort)

Beautiful country.

ELEANOR

How long have you been manager of

the Inn?

TOM

Not long.

FRANKLIN

Got any paved roads?

TOM

No we don't.

You'll have a great deal of

privacy. There are only a few

guests right now as it's the off-

season... I'm hoping to make some

improvements by next Spring --

F

FRANKLIN

(panicked)

I... I can't stay here. This place

is a wreck.

E

LEANOR

Franklin!

TOM

Look on the bright side. Most of

your time will be spent in the

water.

(a beat)

It's true, we've fallen on some

hard times...

RANKLIN

Hard times? This is a disaster! It

should be condemned!

TOM

Yes, we've seen better days.

(a beat)

But then I imagine so have you.

TOM

I'm happy to drive you back to the

train station right now, if that's

what you want.

FRANKLIN

(in a low voice)

Fire. I'm frightened of fire. I

can't get out if I'm upstairs.

TOM

We've got options.

FRANKLIN

Well ventilated, at least.

ROY

Where do you want this, Mr.

Roosevelt?

FRANKLIN

The bedroom, Roy, thank you.

FRANKLIN

Tom, this young man appears quite

competent. Would you ask him if

he'd like to stay on as my valet?

TOM

(politely)

Why don't you ask him yourself?

ELEANOR

This is madness.

FRANKLIN (O.S.)

No doubt.

ELEANOR

Tell me again, Franklin, why are we

here?

FRANKLIN

For the waters. Are you coming?

Mrs. Roosevelt want to swim?

FRANKLIN

Mrs. Roosevelt doesn't know how.

MOTHER, eyeing Franklin approaching in his wheelchair,

TOM

Mr. Roosevelt, I'd like you to meet

Aunt Sally.

FRANKLIN

Aunt Sally.

AUNT SALLY

Good day, sir. I have towels for you.

32.

TOM

Now give it a minute. You'll see

that the mineralization makes the

water more buoyant. The crippled

boy who swam here was actually able

to walk in the water.

FRANKLIN

I can't even stand.

AUNT SALLY

Well, not yet.

46                                                                46

ELEANOR

This is simply revolting.

FRANKLIN

It's not very good, but it is

mysterious.

(holding out his plate)

What in the world do you think

they've poured over this chicken?

Or is it possum?

H

33.

ELEANOR

You want to stay.

FRANKLIN

Yes.

ELEANOR

New York has the best doctors and

hospitals in the country.

F

RANKLIN

I need something new.

ELEANOR

This isn't about getting better is

it? You don't want to come home.

You don't want to live with us.

FRANKLIN

I refuse to be a burden to anyone.

ELEANOR

You're not a burden, you're my

husband.

e reaches out and takes her hand in his.

FRANKLIN

I want to offer you the freedom you

once so generously offered me.

(she pulls it away)

All you've ever known is duty. To

me and to a political career that

unless I can walk no longer exists.

You've been exemplary. Now I'm

telling you you're free to go.

ELEANOR

(her voice rising)

No.

(a beat)

I don't want freedom. I want a

marriage. I want a life with you.

Franklin won't let himself believe it.

FRANKLIN

I can't imagine what you think that

life is going to be.

This takes the wind out of Eleanor.

34.

ELEANOR

Oh Franklin... it's not up to me to

imagine, it's up to you.

50                                                               50

ELEANOR

Thank you for stopping by, Mr. Howe.

LOUIS

I thought you might want to see a

friendly face.

(off the silence)

So how's our boy doing?

ELEANOR

Well, he's enjoying the waters very

much. He...

(suddenly overwhelmed)

I think we've lost him.

E

LEANOR

Please excuse me, Mr. Howe.

LOUIS

Don't you think it's time you

called me Louis?

ELEANOR

Louis.

E

35.

LOUIS

Maybe we've been going about this

all wrong. He's down there to be

alone so let's give him what he

wants. We change our focus.

LEANOR

To what?

LOUIS

To you.

52                                                             52

FRANKLIN

To your mineral pool, or whatever

you call it.

TOM

Warm Springs.

FRANKLIN

Too strong?

TOM

Haven't been in a drinking mood lately.

FRANKLIN

I have.

TOM

Actually, its the most god-awful

martini I've ever tasted.

FRANKLIN

Are you always this direct, Tom?

36.

TOM

Well, I never tasted a martini this

bad before.

FRANKLIN

(hurt)

Everyone likes my martinis...

TOM

So they say.

54                                                              54

FRANKLIN

Tell me more about what that boy

did, Aunt Sally.

AUNT SALLY

Well, first he'd always swim over

to the side of the pool and hold

himself there -- make sure he

righted himself. Then... before he

knew it... he'd be standing.

FRANKLIN

If it was only that easy.

AUNT SALLY

Well, you make it hard. Get over to

the side of that pool and grab it.

FRANKLIN

(

humoring her)

Yes, ma'am.

AUNT SALLY

Now you got to remember how you did

it.

F

37.

FRANKLIN

(a nervous laugh)

I'm standing.

FRANKLIN

I'm standing.

56                                                               56

TOM

To standing on your own two feet!

RANKLIN

This water could be the cure -- the

cure! In six months I could be up

and walking!

LIONEL

Evening folks.

FRANKLIN

Cocktail, Lionel?

LIONEL

I can't. I'm working for the

federal government.

FRANKLIN

All the more reason.

(shoving a drink at him)

Sort of late for the mail, isn't it?

F

L

38.

LIONEL

Not for me it isn't. Got a whole

packet of clippings for you, Mr.

Roosevelt. From a Mr. Howe. New

York Times, Journal-American...

don't know what else.

He hands an already opened letter to Franklin.

LIONEL

Your mother wants to know when

you're coming home. She says they

got swimming pools in Hyde Park.

She's mad as all hell.

FRANKLIN

Reading other people's mail is not

only impolite, it's illegal.

LIONEL

Sheriff don't mind. He likes I read

his mail. Saves him the time. Plus

a lot of folks around here can't

read, so it's more a public

service, really.

FRANKLIN

Astonishing. Thank you, Lionel.

He hands Lionel a letter.

IONEL

(reading)

"Miss Missy LeHand." Who's she?

F

RANKLIN

If you must know, she's my social

secretary.

(to Tom)

I'm having her come down.

Lionel reaches into his bag.

LIONEL

Almost forgot... your wife wrote

the nicest letter. She's gonna make

a speech at the League of Women

Voters.

RANKLIN

Give me that.

(

39.

LIONEL

(to Tom)

Says she's gonna keep the Roosevelt

name alive. Least till he starts

walkin' and all.

FRANKLIN

(studying the letter)

This is so unlike Eleanor. She's

terrified of crowds.

ELEANOR

We are facing imminent disaster.

LOUIS

I take full responsibility if you

hyperventilate or faint.

CHAIRWOMAN

Ah, here she is now. Ladies, Mrs.

Franklin Roosevelt.

ELEANOR

Good afternoon. I am so pleased to

be invited here today.

looking down at her

cards)

Too often....

40.

ELEANOR

Too often...

She stops. The pause is deadly. Louis looks ready to jump out

a window. Eleanor continues, her voice still pitched too high.

ELEANOR

Too often the great decisions are

originated and given form in bodies

made up wholly of men...

Slowly, she begins to find her voice.

ELEANOR

So that whatever political value

women have to offer is shunted

aside... without expression.

T

his is a mistake.

She looks up from her cards and stares at the audience...

and for the first time speaks spontaneously.

ELEANOR

I think this might be the reason I

am having such a difficult time

giving voice to my own thoughts

here today.

The immediacy of her self-effacing comment charms the room.

ELEANOR

I'm reminded of what someone once

said about looking at an elephant.

That it is impossible to ever see

an entire elephant from one place --

you must walk around it. If our

elected leaders are to be truly

effective then they must be willing

to go out of their way to look

beyond what is right in front of

them. To see the entire elephant.

And for that... they need our help.

The ladies applaud her, much to her relief. Louis beams.

LATER

At a reception following the speech, Eleanor and the

Chairwoman are drinking tea.

F

41.

CHAIRWOMAN

That was so moving, Mrs. Roosevelt.

The Child Welfare Amendment could

use someone with your passion. You

must consider being our

spokesperson.

ELEANOR

Oh. It would be an honor.

CHAIRWOMAN

Wonderful.

TOM

Morning.

FRANKLIN

I walked five steps today!

TOM

Congratulations. Listen, Franklin,

I got word a local reporter wants

to do a story on you.

RANKLIN

I'm hardly newsworthy these days.

(a beat)

How did he find out I'm here?

TOM

Small town -- word gets out. It

probably won't amount to more than

a provincial puff piece but it

might give us some free publicity

for the Inn.

TOM

All right, I know the gentleman.

I'm doing him a favor. You know, I

used to be a journalist.

FRANKLIN

Do you mean all this time I've been

talking to a newspaper man?

42.

TOM

Not anymore. I got in a bit of

trouble in Atlanta. Seems some of

the editorial pieces I wrote

offended the sensibilities of a

local civic group. So I needed to

lay low for a while.

FRANKLIN

(a beat)

You mean the Klan? Good God, Tom...

T

OM

Thankfully, Mr. George Foster

Peabody gave me this job...

FRANKLIN

Well, that explains a few things.

For the life of me, I couldn't

figure out why someone like you was

running this --

TOM

Rat-trap?

FRANKLIN

(laughing, swimming off)

I was going to say dump, but rat-

trap fits nicely.

60                                                               60

GREGORY

Now in 1920 when you were running

for Vice-President...

FRANKLIN

I can't imagine your readers are

interested in ancient history. Cox

and I lost the election by a wide

margin.

GREGORY

It was only a few years ago, Mr.

Roosevelt...

43.

FRANKLIN

Now it's the waters extra minerals

plus its warmth that makes all the

difference. At 90 degrees I can

work my muscles for hours and not

get cold.

GREGORY

As Assistant Secretary of the Navy

during the Great War did you

condone the use of...

FRANKLIN

I forgot one more thing you will

need to write down. Poor

circulation is a chronic problem

for people in my condition.

GREGORY

So... you think it could be a cure?

FRANKLIN

I don't know.

GREGORY

But you're hopeful?

FRANKLIN

Yes. I am.

Therefore, a formal questionnaire

should be composed in order so we

may hear from all recent delegates

as to how we can do better in '28 to

Franklin Roosevelt, etc., etc.

MISSY LE HAND, 30, is sitting at a card table, typing.

Brunette with some early gray, she is sturdy in build with a

plain but friendly face.

MISSY

Very good. Do you want this out

today?    F

RANKLIN

Tomorrow will be fine.

MISSY

Alright.

FRANKLIN

Thank you, Missy, and c.c. that to

Louis.

Missy rises with a stack of envelopes and heads out.

Roy enters with a plate of pancakes in front of Franklin.

ROY

Hungry, Mr. Roosevelt?

FRANKLIN

Not really.

ROY

Who do you write to every morning?

FRANKLIN

Different people I knew in

politics. Just in case they ever

want me back.

ROY

So you'll be ready when you get

your legs workin' again?

FRANKLIN

Exactly.

45.

There is a knock at the screen door. An earnest young man,

BENJAMIN PRENDERGAST, 18, is peering in. He has a newspaper.

PRENDERGAST

Excuse me, are you Mr. Roosevelt?

FRANKLIN

Yes. Who are you?

Roy opens the door to Prendergast, who enters.

PRENDERGAST

My name is Benjamin Prendergast.

I've come to see if you could speak

at this year's graduation ceremony

at the schoolhouse. You being so

famous and all.

Prendergast unfolds the newspaper. There is a picture of

Franklin under the heading "FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SWIMS HIS WAY

TO HEALTH!"

FRANKLIN

I'll be damned.

PRENDERGAST

Would you be available?

FRANKLIN

(looking up)

When? Next spring?

PRENDERGAST

Next week. We only have a four

month school year.

FRANKLIN

How is that possible?

PRENDERGAST

Tax dollars only cover that much.

FRANKLIN

Are you graduating?

PRENDERGAST

No, sir. I'm the principal.

FRANKLIN

I see.

But Franklin doesn't see.

PRENDERGAST

Now that we're all here let me

introduce to you to our guest

speaker today, Mr. Franklin

Roosevelt.

FRANKLIN

Good afternoon.

At Groton, where I graduated from

high school, our beloved Headmaster

encouraged his students to enter

public life...

FRANKLIN

I chose to attend Harvard for my

undergraduate work and then

Columbia for my law degree.

I followed my Headmaster's advice

and sought a career in public life.

But circumstances beyond my control

have made that... very difficult...

FRANKLIN

I've given many speeches in my

life... I don't know why I'm having

such a hard time making this one...

FRANKLIN

My God did you see how they were

looking at me?

TOM

They welcomed your company, Franklin.

FRANKLIN

Don't patronize me.

TOM

Don't patronize them. These people

go to bed night after night with

half-empty stomachs -- your legs

are the least of their worries.

66                                                                66

AUNT SALLY

Mr. Roosevelt, aren't you cold?

OY

Mr. Roosevelt, you're gonna catch

the chill if you don't get out of

the water.

48.

AUNT SALLY

You got to tell him, Mr. Loyless.

He won't listen to us.

TOM

Franklin, we need to talk...

Normally we close up this time of

year and the staff goes home for

the holidays.

ELEANOR

Grandmother Delano brought this

No, Elliot. Just your grandmama.

No.

John, give it to him!

JOHN

Papa always does it.

I can do it.

ELEANOR

It was an extraordinary turnout

this afternoon. Louis says there

were over two hundred people in the

audience.

50.

FRANKLIN

That's marvelous, Babs.

ROY

I've got you, sir.

FRANKLIN

You wonder why I want to go back to

Georgia... it's to avoid people who

look at me the way you just did.

ELEANOR

You truly believe the waters...

(with difficulty)

... that they are helping?

FRANKLIN

Don't talk to me as if I were a

child. Choosing your words so

carefully...

ELEANOR

How am I supposed to talk to you?

FRANKLIN

Like I was! Talk to me like I was!

ELEANOR

I don't know how anymore.

all the way from Minneapolis to

shake your hand, sir.

PAT

Stuck in this chair I do nothing

but read. Newspapers, mostly.

Usually I'm just looking for

something -- anything -- that'll

tell me there's even the slightest

chance I'll walk again.

FRANKLIN

I really don't know what to say.

PAT

Well, you're here. And we're here.

Together... we'll think of

something.

FRANKLIN

(whispering)

Get me out of here.

71                                                                71

him away from Tom.

RANKLIN

I want no part of this. I come here

for privacy!

TOM

This isn't your personal spa!

I have a business to run.

53.

FRANKLIN

Exactly. You have a business to

run, not I!

TOM

No one's asking anything of you!

FRANKLIN

Of course they are!

TOM

Do you know what it took for most

of them to get here?

FRANKLIN

It's not my concern. I want to be

left alone!

TOM

My God, you're afraid of these people.

FRANKLIN

Afraid? What you're talking about?

TOM

You look at them with the same

repulsion and pity as everyone else.

FRANKLIN

Don't be ridiculous. I resent your

trying to --

TOM

You don't want to be around them

because then that would make you

one of them, wouldn't it?

Franklin furiously wheels himself back towards the cottage,

getting stuck on the dirt path along the way.

FRANKLIN

God damn it!

Tom comes to his aid but he is brushed off by Franklin.

FRANKLIN

Out of my way! Get out of my

goddamn way!

Franklin wheels himself off.

54.

72                                                             72

ROY

Right on time.

TOM

Good evening.

FRANKLIN

Expecting someone?

TOM

Yes.

TOM

(to the Conductor)

I'm looking for a young gentleman

by the name of Botts. Fred Botts?

CONDUCTOR

Don't know anything about that.

TOM

I expect he would be in a

wheelchair.

CONDUCTOR

You mean the cripple? He's in the

baggage car.

73                                                             73

FRANKLIN

Mother of God.

TOM

His pulse is slow.

75                                                                75

FRANKLIN

Son, can you hear me?

FRANKLIN

Fred?

FRED

Mr. Roosevelt?...

FRANKLIN

It's going to be all right, son.

e hands Franklin a worn newspaper clipping from his pocket.

FRED

The conductor wouldn't let me ride

in the passenger car with my chair.

FRANKLIN

When did you last eat?

FRED

Knoxville.

56.

TOM

Knoxville had to be three days ago.

FRANKLIN

Roy, take him to the car.

As Roy lifts Fred in his arms, Franklin wheels himself to the

engine car. Tom follows as they approach the CONDUCTOR.

FRANKLIN

Who in their right mind let's a

child ride in the baggage car!

You could have killed that boy.

CONDUCTOR

He had polio. Probably still

contagious.

The Conductor walks away, dismissively. Franklin pushes his

chair up and stops the Conductor in his tracks.

FRANKLIN

Don't dismiss me because I sit in

this chair!

CONDUCTOR

Get away from me.

Franklin pushes the wheels of his chair with such force he

knocks the Conductor over.

FRANKLIN

You ignorant son of a bitch. If I

could, I'd get up right now and

lock you in that box car! See how

you like it!

TOM

Franklin...

The Conductor struggles to get up.

CONDUCTOR

Get this lunatic off me!

Franklin wheels himself towards Tom's car where Fred is now

lying across the back seat. The sight of Fred drains all

anger from Franklin's face.

FRANKLIN

Where's the nearest hospital?

57.

TOM

Atlanta.

FRANKLIN

What about a doctor?

TOM

Closer, but not by much.

ROY

Train's ready.

FRANKLIN

(quietly)

Let's go home.

76                                                               76

ranklin is using his watch to take Fred's pulse.

77                                                               77

FRANKLIN

How many can pay?

TOM

Fewer than half.

FRANKLIN

I want these people in the

cottages, not in the inn. It's

safer.

TOM

Well, it's the way it has to be.

58.

FRANKLIN

What do you mean?

TOM

I've already had some complaints.

(awkwardly)

This is the start of the season,

Franklin. I've got regulars who

have come for years. Healthy folks

over all... They're threatening to

check out, afraid they might catch

polio.

FRANKLIN

Such ignorance! Don't they know

that after the fever breaks we are

no longer contagious?

TOM

I'm going to have to ask that you

not use the pool during regular

hours. I'll put time aside for you

late in the day... and it won't be

possible for you to eat in the

dining room either. But I promise

I'll find someplace suitable.

FRANKLIN

They don't want us to eat in their

presence?

TOM

Of course for you I can make other

accommodations.

FRANKLIN

(a beat)

That won't be necessary.

Franklin goes back to writing out the check. Tom stands

waiting, the sound of the pen scratching seemingly

interminable. Their mutual discomfort is obvious.

Franklin rips the check from the ledger and holds it for Tom.

TOM

Thank you.

FRANKLIN

We still need a doctor here.

TOM

For Fred?

59.

FRANKLIN

(pointedly)

For everyone.

FRANKLIN (V.O.)

I am taking on responsibilities

which none of my schooling in the

spheres of higher learning or

politics could have prepared me

for... I have seen the casualties

of war. But I have never seen this,

a suffering so insidious, so

silent, that it rattles my soul."

FRED

When can I swim?

FRANKLIN

Soon. When you're a little stronger.

FRED

When I'm asleep, in my dreams, I

can still walk.

FRANKLIN

Me too.

(a beat)

How long has it been... since you

walked?

FRED

Nine years. I'd just learned to

ride a bike. After I got sick my

mom was sure that the bike had

caused it.

60.

FRANKLIN

Did she sell it?

FRED

No. She took it out back and shot it.

81                                                                81

FRANKLIN

And who is this delightful child?

DAISY

(giggling)

Daisy.

FRANKLIN

All right Daisy, try and kick your legs.

FRANKLIN

Excellent, Daisy!

JAKE

Jake Perrini, Bronx, New York.

ROY

Roy, sir.

JAKE

How you doin'?

JAKE

C'mon -- I won't bite.

T

61.

ROY

(shaking his hand)

Mighty fine, sir. Mighty fine.

JAKE

Hey, would you mind pulling me

outta this trap, Roy? I wanna get

airborne.

Roy gently lifts Jake up and out of his chair, into his arms

like a child.

JAKE

Do me one more favor? Throw me in?

Roy tosses Jake to the heavens and he SAILS through the air

emitting a jungle cry of pure emotional release before

FRANKLIN

Now folks, these exercises are of

my own devising so bear with me.

Some laugh, some are confused. This is new territory for

everyone.

FRANKLIN

My hope is that in repeating these

movements over and over in the

water I'm in some way causing the

muscles to regenerate themselves

and repair the damage.

He swims to the edge of the pool.

FRANKLIN

So everybody grab the edge of the

pool and move what you can!

hey disperse, eagerly ready to do what Franklin tells them.

FRANKLIN

Go ahead now, do your best!

Their legs barely rise up to splash the surface. Undeterred,

Franklin leads them on, spiritedly.

In the distance we see Tom, leaning against a tree, watching

everything.

RANKLIN

Do you have a reservation?

FRANKLIN

Whether in here or our there, I

guarantee you the food will taste

Damn!

You're losing, Doc.

Doc? I'm sorry, you're Franklin

Roosevelt, aren't you?

FRANKLIN

Depends.

(suspiciously)

Are you a lawyer?

HELENA

No.

FRANKLIN

Then Roosevelt it is. Wait!

He jumps one of Roy's checkers.

HELENA

I'm Helena Mahoney. I'm a physical

therapist.

(off their blank looks)

You have no idea who I am, do you?

FRANKLIN

Should I?

HELENA

I wrote you a letter right after I

saw the article in the paper.

Didn't you read it?

FRANKLIN

It got read, I assure you. But

probably not by me.

Helena glances down at the checkerboard and points to it.

HELENA

(to Roy)

He's open right there.

65.

ROY

He sure is.

ROY

Thank you, ma'am.

HELENA

I've been studying the effects of

moist heat on polio patients and I

think with repeated exercise in

warm water...

FRANKLIN

It can help them regain lost

strength.

HELENA

Yes.

FRANKLIN

Incredibly I've come to the same

conclusion myself.

Well, you're the doctor.

Your gluteus maximus is better than

I hoped. It will serve you well.

I'm serious. Your right leg has

some movement along the thigh.

That's good because we can use it

to help extend your hip, flex your

knee and rotate your tibia.

FRANKLIN

I'm supposed to walk on one side?

The water may help build some

strength I'm not able to see yet.

But to do that you would need to

swim in the water much of the day.

epidemic over 16,000 people got

polio in the New York area alone?

Sounds like you've been reading up.

FRANKLIN

I wish there was more to read. Damn

few things being written about any

of this. To think of someone like

Fred... locked away... his mind and

heart so vibrant...

TOM

It's a waste. An awful waste.

Franklin takes a beat -- the weight of this sinking in.

FRANKLIN

What's the acreage here?

TOM

Roughly twelve hundred or so. Why?

FRANKLIN

I want to buy it. I think it would

make one hell of an investment.

TOM

Investment?

FRANKLIN

Twelve hundred acres? Enough for

two resorts, don't you think?

TOM

It would take money. There's a lot

of land, rebuilding the inn, adding

ramps and so many people can't pay...

Do you think old Peabody will sell?

He'll sell.

It's hardly a done deal, but for

forsaken place.

Polio's always going to be a losing

financial proposition, but it doesn't

mean you shouldn't buy the place.

FRANKLIN

I am buying it. Make no mistake

about that.

PAT

Good for you, Doc.

FRED

If you don't mind my asking, how

will people pay for the services

you are going to offer here? Most

people with polio have a hard enough

Tom, struggling with a suitcase, comes down the ramp. He

deposits it in the trunk and then walks precariously back up

the ramp, having difficulty navigating the incline.

He goes back into the house for one last bag. When he comes

out, he's surprised by what he sees --

FRANKLIN (O.S.)

Where do you think you're going?

Franklin is being pushed by Roy in his wheelchair. They are

both dressed in pajamas and bathrobes, though Franklin has a

blanket around his shoulders to shield him from the morning

chill.

Tom is caught. This is everything he wanted to avoid.

TOM

Going to Asheville to see my

parents.

From the sight of Tom's car stuffed with luggage, it is clear

he is not coming back.

FRANKLIN

I can't do this without you...

we're only just beginning.

TOM

You. (You're beginning, not me.

I've got cancer, Franklin. It's

spread everywhere.

Franklin is stunned -- utterly thrown.

FRANKLIN

I... I'll take you to the best doctors.

We'll go to Atlanta right now --

TOM

I've seen the best doctors. When

you were in New York they opened me

up for the second time. Now I just

want to die in the bed I was born.

Franklin is struggling with this.

TOM

You're going to do great things.

This place has an identity now --

a purpose. It has you.

TOM

Take care of yourself, Roy.

ROY

God be with you, Mr. Loyless.

On the contrary, I envy you.

Good luck, Franklin.

SARA

ELEANOR

Franklin has invited Louis and me

to see the work he's been doing.

Work! Playing in a pool all day

long? Squandering his birthright on

a group of fawning strangers? I

consider this your fault, Eleanor!

ELEANOR

I beg your pardon, Mama?

SARA

You have indulged him and this is

the result.

ELEANOR

Indulged him? I have indulged him?

ELEANOR

He's a grown man who makes his own

decisions.

SARA

But he does not need to buy it.

ELEANOR

If it's of any comfort to you, I

agree.

LOUIS

I'm against it as well. It will

consume too much of his time and

energy.

SARA

Then it is settled. We tell him no.

ELEANOR

No, it is not settled. We must hear

him out. Louis and I must see for

ourselves the work that he has been

doing then we will all discuss this

further.

HELENA

Excellent, Fred! Keep going...

They are surrounded by many others, Franklin, Eloise,

Woodhall, Pat and Jake.

The BEEPING of a car horn gets their immediate attention.

Roy leaps off the porch, skipping the stairs as his brother

Pete drives up in Tom's car. He parks it and steps out.

PETE

Morning, Mr. Roosevelt.

FRANKLIN

Peter, what are you doing with

Tom's car?

PETE

I was as sorry as anyone to hear

about Mr. Loyless's passing. Wished

he coulda' lived to see this!

FRANKLIN

What are you talking about?

PETE

Mr. Loyless had me come up and

fetch this right after he brung it

to Asheville. "Pete, he said, "Take

this home and fix it up for Mr.

Roosevelt."

FRANKLIN

Pete... I can't drive a car.

PETE

You can now.

Roy opens the passenger door and lifts Franklin into the

driver's seat.

PETE

Get on in and I'll teach ya'!

He begins showing off a system of pulleys and levers that

have been attached to both pedals. They thread through holes

in a second dashboard, attached to polished wood knobs.

It's a hand-controlled automobile.

PETE

That one there is your brake.

75.

FRANKLIN

Got it.

PETE

And this here's the gas.

FRED

Hot damn! You got hand controls.

PAT

That is a thing of beauty!

Franklin begins running his hands over the polished wood knobs.

PETE

Now you got to push it real smooth

or it goes all herky-jerky.

Franklin excitedly turns the key and starts it up.

PETE

Wait, Mr. Roosevelt, you're not

ready to drive yet!

FRANKLIN

Oh, yes I am!

Franklin hits the gas as the car begins HALTING and JERKING

the whole way down the driveway. Pete is yelling out

instructions but Franklin ignores him.

They all watch as he pulls away.

As the car hits the end of the driveway Franklin reaches

across Pete and opens his passenger door pushing him out.

Franklin tears off alone -- out on his first solo spin.

schools due to their infirmities.

77.

He points to a dilapidated gardener's shed.

FRANKLIN

We also require a blacksmith's shop

so we can craft braces here on the

premises. I've found a wonderful

local man who can make crutches and

canes. His work is outstanding. Of

course what is most desperately

needed is a hospital. That's going

to put my fund raising abilities to

the test.

Franklin wheels himself up a ramp to the Inn as Eleanor and

Louis follow.

Surrounded by peeling wallpaper and threadbare furniture

E

Eleanor and Louis exchange glances.

LEANOR

What exactly are you proposing,

Franklin?

FRANKLIN

That this will be the first polio

rehabilitation and treatment center

in the world. My personal trust

almost covers the price of the Inn

and the surrounding land. There

will be a modest tuition charged to

the patients which should hold us

over while I seek out investors.

LOUIS

Franklin, you're risking everything

you have...

ELEANOR

And there are other costs to

consider.

FRANKLIN

Mama will see that the children are

provided for.

ELEANOR

I'm not speaking of money.

78.

FRANKLIN

I have found something here which

makes waking up in the morning

remotely bearable and the two of

you stand there...

ELEANOR

Franklin, I need for you to be

practical and realistic.

FRANKLIN

(furious)

Practical? I am trapped inside a

body that no longer moves of my own

volition. I am trying to be

practical. Now either you're with

me or against me. In or out!

ELEANOR

I don't care for ultimatums

disguised as debate.

Eleanor starts to leave.

FRANKLIN

Where are you going? Eleanor! Get

back here.

ELEANOR

I will see you gentlemen tonight.

She leaves.

LOUIS

You can't talk to her like that.

FRANKLIN

Oh really? Are you an expert on

this now? How should I speak to my

wife, Louis?

LOUIS

With the respect she deserves.

(a beat)

Look, I don't deny the work you're

doing here could be important --

FRANKLIN

Could be?

79.

LOUIS

The issue is whether you want to

run a rehabilitation center or

whether you want to run for office

again.

FRANKLIN

When I can walk, I'll run.

Eleanor approaches the pool. It is as quiet as a church. She

is stunned to observe over a dozen tables set up in the

water.

On each table is a child or an adult polio wearing their

bathing suit. Next to them is a Physical Therapist also in

bathing attire conducting therapy. In hushed tones the

Physical Therapists encourage and work the distressed limbs

of the patients as Helena swims to each table overseeing the

work being done.

Eleanor sits down in a chair and watches fascinated.

The camera pans various tables revealing legs in braces,

legs in wheelchairs, shapely legs, flaccid legs, children's

legs... some reveal illicit romances, betrayed by secret

hand holding and hands on thighs.

Jake and a new physical therapist, MARY BETH, are

particularly cozy.

FRANKLIN (O.S.)

This is a very special night we're

celebrating. At last we are together

eating in this dining room!

The hands come up and out from under the table, applauding.

ON FRANKLIN

He is in his wheelchair dressed in a jacket and tie.

FRANKLIN

Now please join me in welcoming

Miss Jackie Mills, a new arrival

along with her father, Samuel, all

the way from Oakland, California.

CLOSE-UP ON JACKIE

Eight years old with black hair. Her legs are in braces and

she grips her father's hand tightly.

FRANKLIN

Let us also take this opportunity to

welcome our two able-bodied guests,

Mr. Louis Howe and my better half,

Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt.

ON ELEANOR AND LOUIS

Waving politely from their seats.

FRANKLIN

Now for the musical portion of our

program...

JAKE

Wait a minute! I can't let this

opportunity pass without saying out

loud what a lot of us feel in our

hearts right now.

(a beat)

You're a man among men, Franklin.

A WOMAN'S VOICE

And women!

DAISY

And children!

JAKE

(laughing)

It's a real democracy at Warm

Springs -- everybody gets heard!

(to Franklin)

You listening?

Eleanor, seated next to Franklin, watches as Franklin, in a

rare moment of emotional nakedness, is at a loss for words.

JAKE

All right then, if I may do the

honors of presenting to you the

lovely Miss Eloise Hutchison of

Cottage C.

Eloise wheels herself out. In a sweet, but untrained voice,

she begins the introduction to her song:

81.

ELOISE

(singing)

"Think of what you're losing by

constantly refusing to dance with me.

Y

Aou'd be the idol of France with me.

nd yet you stand there

And shake your foolish head dramatically,

W

hile I sit here so ecstatically.

You just look and say emphatically:

Not this season!

There's a reason!"

Some members of the audience begin to smile, knowing what's

coming. Various STAFF step out from the kitchen to watch.

Eloise is joined by three others -- all of them in wheelchairs.

ELOISE & CHORUS

(singing)

"I won't dance! Don't ask me!

I won't dance! Don't ask me;

I won't dance, monsieur, with you."

Simple, but clever choreography utilizing the wheelchairs,

has the audience cheering.

ELOISE & CHORUS

"My heart won't let my feet do

C

things they should do."

HORUS

"You know what? You're lovely."

ELOISE

"And so what? I'm lovely."

CHORUS

"But oh! What you do to me!

I'm like an ocean wave that's

bumped on the shore;

I feel so absolutely stumped on the

floor!"

This is too much for the crowd, including Franklin, Eleanor

and Louis. They laugh and cry in equal measure at the sight

of Eloise and her Chorus.

The song finished, Franklin quiets down the crowd.

82.

FRANKLIN

Before we say good night,

I understand our Royal-Taskmaster-

in-Residence, Miss Mahoney, insists

on having the last word.

Helena rises from her seat.

HELENA

I don't think words describe

adequately what Daisy and I would

like to show all of you.

(calling out)

Are you ready, Daisy?

Daisy's mother, Cecile, carries Daisy to the center of the

room where Helena meets them. Helena bends down and removes

Daisy's braces.

The room is hushed.

Daisy then begins to WALK tentatively towards her mother.

ON FRANKLIN

Overwhelmed by what is taking place. He looks around and

takes in the sight of so many different faces...

Some are beaming, some are fighting back tears, some look

away... the sight of it almost too painful... a reminder of

their own private battles.

ON DAISY

Only a step or two away from her mother she FALLS the short

distance and lands in her mother's outstretched arms.

WILD CHEERS go up in the room while Daisy's face glows with

pride. She connects with Franklin, who matches her smile with

his own -- genuine and beatific.

Roy lifts Franklin out of the wheelchair and on to the bed.

Eleanor enters holding a lit candle.

Roy is about to begin Franklin's bedtime routine, but Eleanor

gently reaches out and touches him on the arm.

ELEANOR

Let me.

83.

Roy looks to Franklin, who nods it's all right, and exits.

Eleanor closes the door and puts the candle on the bureau.

A

fter a beat, Franklin begins to unbuckle his pants. He then

lies back on the bed.

ELEANOR

What is your most pressing concern?

Eleanor kneels before him and tugs the pants down, slowly, so

as not to catch on the braces.

Eleanor folds the pants and carefully places them over the

back of a chair.

FRANKLIN

Getting a doctor to live on the

premises full-time. Someone who,

at the very least, could monitor

our progress. Make us legitimate.

She begins to take off Franklin's braces -- a series of

intricate buckles.

Eleanor slides the braces off his legs. His legs, though now

deeply tanned are withered and spindly. He is still wearing

his shoes.

ELEANOR

And that costs more money.

FRANKLIN

Yes.

Eleanor puts the heavy braces against the wall and kneels

once again to untie his shoelaces.

FRANKLIN

But the real problem is no one is

interested. The annual Orthopedics

Convention is being held in Atlanta

this weekend and I offered to

speak.

(his anger surfacing)

They turned me down flat.

Eleanor takes Franklin's pajama bottoms off the bed and with

tender care pulls them up his legs.

84.

ELEANOR

A few weeks ago, the conditions at

a garment factory on West 27th

Street were brought to my

attention. The owners claimed

everything was satisfactory, but

would never let anyone in to

conduct a proper inspection.

She reaches for Franklin's hands and pulls him up to a seated

position. They are now face to face.

ELEANOR

It took awhile, but we finally got in.

FRANKLIN

We?

He searches her face for clues as to the woman she's become.

He starts to unbutton his shirt and put on his pajama top.

Eleanor sits in a chair across from him.

ELEANOR

I showed up with someone from the

Labor Board and we refused to leave

until they let us in.

FRANKLIN

What are you suggesting?

ELEANOR

At the risk of my good standing

with the Junior Assistance League,

I suggest we crash the party.

She stands and walks over to Franklin and runs her hand

through his hair.    E

LEANOR

Good night, Franklin.

She goes to the door and opens it letting in a shaft of light

against the candle-lit room.

FRANKLIN

Good night, Babs.

She blows the candle out and closes the door.

the stairs.

The stage is lit with a skeleton hanging on a stand and large

projections on a screen of spinal discs while a DOCTOR, in a

dull litany, intones a prepared speech.

DOCTOR

A clinical situation where the

radicular or nerve root is

compressed by the prolapsed disc is

referred to as a radiculopathy.

Double doors fly open with a BANG as all heads turn to see

Franklin and Eleanor.

ELEANOR

So sorry we're late!

FRANKLIN

Good afternoon!

Eleanor talks quickly while wheeling Franklin down the aisle.

ELEANOR

(introducing herself)

Eleanor Roosevelt, niece of the

late President Theodore Roosevelt

and this is my husband, Franklin,

former Assistant Secretary of the Navy.

FRANKLIN

(sotto to Eleanor)

Are you sure this worked on 27th

Street?

LEANOR

(under her breath)

It seemed to at the time.

86.

They reach the befuddled Doctor on stage whose name tag

reads, "Dr. Bissell."

ELEANOR

Thank you, Dr. Bissell for agreeing

to let us share the stage with you

today. It was so generous of you.

Dr. Bissell smiles limply, saving face. The audience vaguely

applauds. Franklin and Eleanor are now center stage.

ELEANOR

My husband, as many of you may have

read, is a victim of polio.

However, victim is only a

definition, not a state of mind.

Franklin?

He looks at her completely amazed. Eleanor gives him an

F

encouraging nod to take over.

RANKLIN

We all know that poor circulation

is a chronic problem for limbs

damaged by polio... I've never been

able to swim more than a few

minutes without becoming too cold.

But there's a place, gentlemen...

a miraculous place not three hours

from here where the water is filled

with natural minerals at a

temperature of almost 90 degrees.

That place, gentlemen, is called

Warm Springs.

CLOSE-UP

One DOCTOR in particular, 60's, leans forward in his chair,

listening with great interest.

FRANKLIN

Patients can stay in these waters

for up to an hour. This is

essential in allowing them the time

to work on strengthening their

muscles.

ELEANOR

We have come to the shared

conclusion that research for the

cause and the cure for infantile

paralysis is paramount.

(MORE)

87.

However, until NOR(cont'd)

ELEA that day arrives

more emphasis has be placed on

rehabilitation. We personally

invite you to Warm Springs to come

and take a look. Thank you.

ON THE AUDIENCE

These "men of science" are mesmerized by Eleanor's style,

both warm and immediate. She has disarmed them with her lack

of pretension.

There is a receiving line in place to get a last word or an

autograph with Franklin and Eleanor. DR. WILLIS,

bespectacled, speaks with them.

DR. WILLIS

I saw you speak at the Legion Hall

in Cleveland last Spring.

ELEANOR

For the League of Women Voters?

DR. WILLIS

You created quite a stir. Not sure

you'll be asked back.

Franklin is ready to intervene but Eleanor puts her hand on

E

his shoulder stopping him.

LEANOR

(all smiles)

Well, I believe you must say what

you feel in your heart -- what you

feel is right, for you'll be

criticized anyway. Damned if you do

-- damned if you don't.

DR. HEBERT, military in bearing -- the doctor who listened so

intensely -- steps up in line and shakes hands with Eleanor

and then Franklin.

DR. HEBERT

Dr. Peter Hebert. I've been doing

my own studies in this area.

(MORE)

DR. HEBERT(cont'd)

If it is possible I'd like to come

and make an evaluation for the

Journal of Orthopedic Medicine.

Roy is fast asleep tucked around the wheelchair in the back

seat.

Franklin smiles in Eleanor's direction. She looks back at him

shyly and smiles in return. But her expression changes when

she sees something in his eyes -- something she hasn't seen

for a long time.

ELEANOR

What is it?

FRANKLIN

(a beat)

Who are you?

Franklin reaches out and takes her hand, pulling her close.

He stretches his whole arm around her and places her hand on

one of the driving knobs, his hand on top of hers.

ELEANOR

I don't know how to drive.

FRANKLIN

I'll teach you.

They operate the car together -- their connection complete.

Franklin and Eleanor are sitting in the front seat of the

car. Louis is already up on the train platform.

ELEANOR

I'll break the news to Mama.

Franklin smiles as they look at each other like two naughty

children.

ELEANOR

I think it's going to be fun.

Eleanor bursts out laughing, Franklin joins in.

FRANKLIN

Babs... words fail me.

ELEANOR

You? Franklin Roosevelt?

She leans in and kisses Franklin on the mouth.

ELEANOR

I do so love you.

She slides out of the car and goes up to the platform and

A

boards the train while Franklin watches her.

Farmer and his Wife from the school house graduation

approach Franklin.

ARMER

Mr. Roosevelt you lookin' mighty fit.

FARMER'S WIFE

Fine day, isn't it.

FRANKLIN

It is. How's the Boll Weevil

A beaming Eleanor sits down next to Louis. He too is looking

very pleased. Eleanor takes notice.

ELEANOR

Why do I get the feeling we're not

smiling about the same thing?

The train begins pulling out.

They both look out at Franklin. Locals are coming up to his

car surrounding him -- he is a magnet.

Louis is seated in the front row of the balcony of the State

Assembly, his feet up on the railing, eating pistachio nuts.

Also seated are two politicos, JAMES HASTINGS and STEPHEN

TELLER.

HASTINGS

You can't kiss babies from a

wheelchair. It'll scare their

mothers half to death.

TELLER

Al Smith's got a lock on the

presidential nomination.

LOUIS

Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't

you think even after all these

years that old Al's still a little

rough around the edges?

They laugh knowing this is a huge understatement.

LOUIS

Franklin can help soften his image.

HASTINGS

How?

LOUIS

Let him put Smith's name in

nomination.

Teller and Hastings are none to sure.

TELLER

Well, he is a helluva speech maker.

HASTINGS

Yeah, but is your man up to it?

LOUIS

It's in the bag, guys. Count on it.

Bluffing is one of Louis's strong suits and it looks like

they're buying it.

Just then, Louis notices a familiar face down on the floor.

Franklin is on the phone. Roy stands by his side.

FRANKLIN

Hello, Souders. How are you?...

Couldn't be better. I was wondering

if you'd found a buyer for my naval

prints?

I see. Well, they're in marvelous

condition... All right, Souders. Oh

one more thing... I have some

beautiful pieces of my

Grandfather's -- T'ang Dynasty...

Really?... An auction in the Fall?

Franklin is walking on crutches aided by Roy. Nearby, a group

of children practice on parallel bars with Helena.

FRANKLIN

What am I going to tell these people

if I have to close things down?

ROY

That you did the best you could.

Franklin gives Roy a look of gratitude, then notices Lionel

approaching with his mail bag.

Lionel hands Franklin a fistful of open envelopes.

FRANKLIN

Any good news?

LIONEL

Creditors are gettin' cranky.

FRANKLIN

The operative word was good.

LIONEL

Oh, yah, almost forgot. The doctor

that came and studied ya'll sent

his report.

Lionel offers up the envelope, but then pulls it back before

handing it over.

Franklin nods then grabs it from Lionel. He rips it open and

begins devouring the report.

Helena entering the cottage.

HELENA

It's not as bad as you think.

Franklin slams the door behind her and wheels over to the

HELENA

FRANKLIN

HELENA

"There is marked falling away of

the muscle masses on either side of

the spine in the lower lumbar

She brings the pages down, but Franklin gestures her to

continue.

HELENA

"I feel after studying him that the

psychological factor in his

management is paramount. He has

such courage and ambition. Yet at

the same time he is such an

extraordinarily sensitive emotional

mechanism...

It is difficult for her to continue.

Please.

HELENA

which we can muster to lead him

successfully to a recognition of

FRANKLIN

Patronizing son-of-a-bitch! I

wanted to walk again.

Franklin, I won't play this game. I

won't feel sorry for you.

HELENA

I met a boy today, ten years old.

He's paralyzed from the waist down.

Responding to a knock at the door, Roy gets up from sitting

on the couch with Franklin, sullen and inattentive.

H

e opens the door to Louis who walks right in.

ROY

Good afternoon, Mr. Howe.

LOUIS

Hello, Roy.

Roy takes his hat and coat and exits to the bedroom.

LOUIS

I can't believe you've made me come

all the way back to this hell hole!

FRANKLIN

I've done no such thing.

F

97.

LOUIS

I'm here to take you to Houston.

You started your speech yet?

FRANKLIN

I'm not going.

He stares at Franklin, drinking. Shaking his head, he goes

over to the sidebar and pours one for himself.

LOUIS

You know what this is, don't you?

It's a golden opportunity. A

springboard for you to run for

Governor.

ranklin is silent. Frustrated, Louis takes a seat in

Franklin's empty wheelchair.

LOUIS

Ever hear of a Civil War General

named Francis Nicholls?

FRANKLIN

No.

LOUIS

Well, I never heard of him either.

But this was one brave son-of-a-

bitch. Fought for the Confederacy

and lost his left arm in one battle

and his left foot in another. Then

after the war he ran and won the

Governorship of Louisiana -- twice!

FRANKLIN

He was a war hero.

LOUIS

(with emphasis)

Twice.

(a beat)

Look, I've worked like a dog to

keep your name in play, grovelling

at the feet of the powers-that-be

in back rooms.

FRANKLIN

As much for you as for me.

98.

LOUIS

I'll be damned if I'm going to let

you pass up a chance like this.

It's time -- and you're ready.

EXT. COTTAGE - AFTERNOON

Waiting on the porch are Eleanor and Helena, who are seated,

talking. Louis exits the cottage, defeated.

LOUIS

Your turn.

Eleanor rises and goes into the cottage as Louis takes her

seat next to Helena.

INT. COTTAGE - CONTINUING

ELEANOR

Roy, so good to see you.

ROY

Very good to see you, Mrs.

Roosevelt.

She approaches a surprised Franklin. Leaning in, she runs a

hand across his stubbly beard. He looks up at her.

ELEANOR

You're a mess.

FRANKLIN

The report. I'll never...

She sits by his side and Franklin begins to cry. His sobs

grow louder connecting to the despair deep inside him. It

unleashes an avalanche of grief.

ELEANOR

Oh my darling...

FRANKLIN

I'm useless, Eleanor. I feel so

useless.

ELEANOR

That's not true. No one can make

you feel inferior without your

consent.

Finally, his sobs subside.

F

E

99.

ELEANOR

You have done a brilliant thing

here -- a magnificent thing.

Eleanor picks up the E

doctor's report and puts it in the fire.

LEANOR

Let's get you in the water.

EXT. THE POOL - DAY

128                                                               128

Franklin is wheeled down to the pool by Roy and Eleanor. When

they get closer, Franklin makes out someone already swimming.

ELLIOT

Hi, Pop!

FRANKLIN

(squinting)

Who's that?

ELLIOT ROOSEVELT is now 17 years old. He has his mother's

enormous blue eyes and his father's natural charisma.

FRANKLIN

Elliot!

LLIOT

Come on! You getting in?

Louis and Helena approach the pool.

FRANKLIN

I sense a conspiracy.

LOUIS

You ain't seen nothin' yet.

ranklin smiles, warily.

EXT. A CLEARING - DAY

129                                                               129

Elliot is climbing a rope dangling high from a tree as

Franklin and Eleanor look up at him. Franklin is standing on

crutches.

Elliot descends with a flourish as Helena approaches Franklin

with a single cane.

HELENA

Franklin, let go of your crutches.

You're not going to need them.

100.

FRANKLIN

What?

HELENA

We're going to make your arms

function as your legs.

FRANKLIN

How is that possible?

HELENA

Elliot, go to your father and stand

on his left side.

ELLIOT

Think this may work, Pop.

HELENA

Eleanor, take the crutch.

Eleanor takes one crutch as Helena takes the other, replacing

it in Franklin's hand with a cane.

Then, with Elliot on Franklin's left side she bends Elliot's

arm at a right angle, like a parallel bar, and hooks

Franklin's left arm around his.

Going over to Franklin's right side she puts a cane in his hand.

HELENA

(to Franklin)

Now use your right shoulder and

pull your left leg forward.

He does so.

HELENA

Good! Now with the muscles in your

left shoulder, pull your right leg.

FRANKLIN

One small bump and I'll land right

on my keister!

HELENA

That's what Elliot is for. He's

going to hold you up. Hitch your

leg! Come on!

Franklin and Elliot attempt to walk. It requires immense

strength and effort on both their parts.

101.

HELENA

(ever the taskmaster)

Elliot, don't lean in -- stand up

straight. Pull against him. He

needs you!

After one or two steps the enormity of it overwhelms Franklin.

FRANKLIN

I can't.

ELLIOT

I'm strong, pop. You can't hurt me.

HELENA

You can do this, Franklin! Keep

going!

They start the walk again. It's awkward... difficult... but

it's working.

LOUIS

(under his breath)

I'll be damned.

Franklin stops, exhausted.

ELEANOR

Franklin, are you all right?

FRANKLIN

I'm fine. I'm just...

Roy runs in with a chair and helps Franklin into it as

Helena, Eleanor, Louis, Elliot and Roy all look at him,

concerned.

HELENA

This isn't a replacement for the real

work we're doing to get you on your

feet again, understand? No one is

throwing in the towel or even agreeing

with that doctor's report...

FRANKLIN

I know, I know.

HELENA

I know it's not practical --

F

H

102.

FRANKLIN

No, it's not.

(a beat)

It's political.

Franklin looks at Louis, then to Eleanor, and realizes that

this could be it.

Franklin and Elliot are walking. Helena is close behind,

coaching.

ELENA

Use Elliot, not the cane. Switch

your weight to Elliot... good! Keep

your head up.

Off to the side Pat, Jake, Eloise, Woodhall and Daisy are

having an informal picnic, observing Franklin.

ELOISE

Why is he working so hard to hide it?

JAKE

He doesn't have a choice.

ELOISE

Oh, I disagree.

JAKE

How can you disagree? "There but

for the grace of God goes us,"

that's what they're saying. As if

our bodies is who we are, but it's

not. It's our souls is who we are,

but they don't know that.

ELOISE

I wish he could just wheel himself

out there in front of everybody.

PAT

He can't do that Eloise, it's

politics.

JAKE

It's not gonna matter if he hides

his legs as long as he don't hide

what he knows. And what he knows is

what it's like to be one of us.

ranklin, getting closer, raises his cane in greeting.

103.

FRANKLIN

Good afternoon, everyone!

Off-balance Franklin goes down hard bringing Elliot down with

him.

Eleanor, Louis and Roy all rush to his aid, but Helena is

there first.

HELENA

Take a moment to catch your breath...

FRANKLIN

Damn. You okay son?

ELLIOT

I'm fine, Pop.

DAISY

You fell down.

FRANKLIN

Yes, I did, Daisy. Twelfth time

today. Must be a new record!

Daisy laughs as do the others, though some can't hide their

concern.

Franklin struggles hard as Roy and Elliot help him to his

feet.

131                                                               131

INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT

Eleanor is packing Franklin's suitcase while Franklin,

sitting up in bed dressed in pajamas, works on his speech.

FRANKLIN

(reading aloud)

And so America must find...

(

reconsidering)

No, America needs a pathfinder...

Louis, pacing in shirtsleeves, nods approvingly.

LOUIS

That's good.

FRANKLIN

To emblaze the trail along a high

road that will avoid... avoid the

bottomless morass...

Discouraged, Franklin pushes aside the pages.

104.

LOUIS

What is it? What's wrong?

FRANKLIN

What if I fall... trying to get to

the podium.

LOUIS

If you fall, you show them how to

get up.

FRANKLIN

No, if I fall in front of thousands

of people I lose everything but

their pity.

(a beat)

They'll be writing my obituary

before I get up off the floor.

LOUIS

Elliot won't let you fall, he'll be

there. All the arrangements have

been made, boss. It'll be fine.

FRANKLIN

Who are we fooling? This will never

work. They'll never let me back

into politics. They'll never see

past my legs.

ELEANOR

My darling, they'll never see past

your legs unless you do.

132                                                               132

EXT. MERIWETHER INN - MORNING

Franklin is settling into the driver's seat of his car, aided

by Roy. Eleanor is seated next to him; Louis and Elliot in

back.

Franklin's attention is diverted by something he sees

straight ahead.

It is the entire Warm Springs group coming down the driveway

in chairs and on crutches.

All the patients, the Push Boys, the physical therapists,

Helena, Jake, Fred, Aunt Sally, Eloise and Lionel.

FRED

Don't worry, Doc -- we're not

coming with you.

F

105.

FRANKLIN

Oh, you'll be with me. No question

of that.

(a beat)

I am proud more than you will ever

know to be part of this community.

(his voice growing

stronger)

A community based not on birthright

or privilege, but on compassion and

courage. The true power of these

waters is that they brought us all

together. Our ability to help one

another is what will make our

victory over polio endure. Our

ability to survive... despite the

odds.

F

ranklin looks out at the sea of faces.

FRANKLIN

What we have done and will continue

to do until this disease is

defeated is come together -- like a

family -- and do what we do best...

(his voice breaking)

Lift each other up.

Franklin starts the car as the crowd begins to disperse.

Then, spying Helena, Franklin calls out to her.

FRANKLIN

Miss Mahoney I need to speak with

you, please.

HELENA

Sure, Doc.

Off her smile, Franklin reaches into his pocket and withdraws

a small box.

FRANKLIN

Thank you.

He hands it to Helena. She just stares at it, at a loss for

words.

RANKLIN

Open it.

She does so, tentatively, revealing a ladies watch.

106.

HELENA

It's beautiful.

FRANKLIN

Don't wear it in the pool.

HELENA

I'll try not to. Good luck,

Franklin.

FRANKLIN

I'm throwing myself to the wolves.

HELENA

You've faced worse. And if they

bite, you can come back here.

FRANKLIN

I'll always come back here.

Helena steps away and Franklin pulls out and down the

driveway.

INT. HOUSTON TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

Dark and deserted Roy is carrying Franklin down a flight of

stairs. Louis is hastily checking over his shoulder. If

possible, Eleanor appears even more nervous than Louis.

FRANKLIN

You're being superstitious, Louis.

There aren't any reporters here.

Suddenly out of the darkness a FLASHBULB POPS revealing a

dozen or more REPORTERS staring incomprehensibly at the sight

of a six foot, 200 lb. man being carried like a baby in the

arms of a black man.

No one does or says a thing. The PHOTOGRAPHER who had the

wherewithal to snap the one picture raises his camera to take

another.

But DAN REED, a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune and

a gentle giant at over six foot-four, reaches out and places

a massive hand over the lens.

Slowly, but firmly, he pulls the camera down.

REED

(

quietly)

No.

107.

Louis and Eleanor stand stock still, tense, watching the

scene unfold

Roy is sweating; his arms growing weak. Elliot brings the

chair around and Roy gently lowers Franklin into it.

It's a measure of Reed's standing with this group that his

authority is unquestioned.

But the Photographer raises his camera again. Only now Reed

isn't as kind. He grabs the camera from him and opens the

back, pulling out the film and exposing it.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Hey!

REED

(tipping his hat)

Good to see you, Mr. Roosevelt.

FRANKLIN

Thank you.

The enormous arena is empty but for some maintenance WORKERS

and JANITORS. Louis enters and makes his way to the stage.

He approaches dead center and stands behind the podium looking

out. GRIPPING the podium hard he ROCKS it back and forth.

Taking no chances, he pulls a hammer out from the rear of his

waistband and a bunch of nails from his coat pocket.

Looking around to see if anyone is paying any attention to

him he quickly ducks down behind the podium.

The sound of HAMMERING fills the hall as Louis, on his knees,

NAILS the podium to the floor.

Twenty thousand CONVENTIONEERS are roasting in the hall. It

is Houston in the summer and it's broiling hot. A sea of hand-

held red, white and blue fans are being waved all at once --

most bearing the words "SMITH FOR PRESIDENT."

Near the stage is a long table where the new breed of RADIO

REPORTERS are seated, each in front of a primitive looking

microphone.

Franklin is standing ramrod straight holding onto Elliot's

arm. He looks handsome in a navy pin-striped suit. As

everyone else is sweating no one notices that Franklin is

perspiring more than F

most.

RANKLIN

Where is she seated?

Louis, a human train wreck himself, reaches over to mop

Franklin's brow with a handkerchief.

LOUIS

In a box stage left. Give me your

hand.

Franklin takes his hand off his cane. It's soaking wet. Louis

wipes it, gently.

FRANKLIN

Louis, what the hell am I doing?

LOUIS

Putting your big toe in the water.

Just then, a VOICE booms out from the loudspeakers:

LOUDSPEAKER (V.O.)

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like

to introduce to you a man who as

Assistant Secretary of the Navy

served our country with distinction.

member of an illustrious family

of long-standing political

commitment to our great nation...

Ladies and gentlemen: Franklin

Delano Roosevelt!

Franklin turns to Elliot and they both take deep breaths.

FRANKLIN

Let's go.

The curtains part and they begin moving forward.

INT. THE STAGE OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION - CONTINUING 137

A BLINDING SPOTLIGHT picks up Franklin and Elliot. The

SPOTLIGHT follows them as they make their way to the podium.

Franklin is hitching each leg forward, slowly. The tip of his

cane hits the floor with pinpoint accuracy for balance and

support.

He leans heavily on Elliot's arm. The walk appears effortless.

He chats with Elliot the whole way, still managing to flash

the CONVENTIONEERS his million dollar smile. But the walk is

slow and the ovation is beginning to fade.

Franklin and Elliot are still ten steps away from the podium.

Sensing the crowd noise weakening, he whispers to Elliot.

FRANKLIN

Laugh as if I'm making a joke.

Elliot throws back his head and laughs. The crowd, wanting to

be in on it, rise as one in a sustained CHEER!

But a puddle of sweat caused by the dripping perspiration

from Franklin's hands is causing the tip of his cane to slip.

Elliot, ever aware, grips him tighter, averting disaster and

finally they reach the podium.

Franklin grabs one side of the podium while Elliot, with a

sleight of hand Houdini would admire, LOCKS his father's

braces, whisks the cane away, pulls his father's speech from

his breast pocket and lays it smoothly on the podium.

THE VIEW FROM BEHIND displays how Franklin's legs are spread

wide for stability as he clutches the podium. He holds on

tightly, as if the wood might snap from his grip.

FROM OUT FRONT the crowd sees only a powerful man standing

tall amidst the flashbulbs POPPING.

Franklin has made it. He is home.

All the denizens of Warm Springs are crowded around the radio.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Smith sits silently puffing on his cigar.

The mineral springs gently ripple as Franklin appears in the

water. As the following words appear on the screen, Franklin

slowly and confidently swims out of frame.

CRAWL

Four years later, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected

President of the United States. He was elected three more

times -- unprecedented in U.S. History.

During his years as President, he saw the country through the

Great Depression and a world war waged on six continents.

On April 12, 1945, in the thirteenth year of his presidency,

at the age of sixty-three, Franklin Roosevelt died in his

cottage at Warm Springs.

The beneficiary of his $562,000 life insurance policy was

Warm Springs... which continues to flourish as a

rehabilitation center to this day.
