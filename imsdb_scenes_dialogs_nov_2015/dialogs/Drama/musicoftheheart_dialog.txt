MUSIC OF THE HEART

SHOOTING DRAFT

January 25, 1999

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Wake up, Roberta!

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Come on, Bert -- get out of bed!

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Please, Bert -- you need to get out

of that bed.

BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)

Can you come out now, Mommy? Please?

BOY #2 (O.S.)

Mommy, Nick broke my crayon!

BOY #1 (O.S.)

Well, Lexi hit me and he almost

broke... he almost broke my ear!

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Hear that? Your boys need you.

ASSUNTA

But I have no room for this!

OFFICER

I'm sorry, M'am. We have orders to

deliver these.

ROBERTA

Watch it, you idiots! Be careful

with those!

ASSUNTA

Why so many?

NICK

(calling)

Mommy, which box has our toys?

ROBERTA

Look, I know he's there, so quit

lying to me!... Then check under

Lana Holden -- Mrs. Lana Holden...

Fine. Just tell Lieutenant Demetras

that his wife called and --

ROBERTA

Ma!

ASSUNTA

No. I want you to listen to me. You

can't keep doing this to yourself --

or to the boys. They need their mother

now. You're a beautiful, talented

woman and you have your whole life

ahead of you.

ROBERTA

If I'm so beautiful and talented,

why did Charles leave me?

ASSUNTA

Because Charles is a big jerk.

(beat)

Now get dressed.

ROBERTA

You really think Charles is a jerk?

ASSUNTA

From the day you married him.

ROBERTA

Why didn't you say something?

ASSUNTA

Since when do you listen to me?

ROBERTA

(sighs, then)

What am I gonna do?

ASSUNTA

First, you eat breakfast. Second,

you go out and get a job -- any job.

Your boys, god-bless-em, are good

eaters -- but I can't afford it.

ROBERTA

Mama, he's gonna get tired of her --

you'll see.

ASSUNTA

Well in the meantime, get a job.

SUPERVISOR

Just wrap. You're not Picasso.

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Picasso would probably put the bows

on the back of the box.

ROBERTA

Brian Turner?

BRIAN

Hello, Roberta.

ROBERTA

I thought you moved away.

BRIAN

I did. I'm in town for my Mom's

birthday.

BRIAN

No -- that's her gift.

ROBERTA

(embarrassed)

Oh! Sorry.

BRIAN

It looks very pretty.

ROBERTA

Thank you.

(beat)

I heard you had a book published. I

didn't read it but...

BRIAN

That's O.K. My parents didn't read

it either. It looks good on their

coffee table, though.

BRIAN

So what are you doing here? I thought

you'd be in Carnegie Hall by now.

ROBERTA

My college professors said it was

too late -- I hadn't had enough

training to be a concert violinist.

So I got a teaching degree instead.

BRIAN

I'll bet you're a great teacher.

ROBERTA

I think I am. It's just that...

(sighs)

See, every time I'd get started

somewhere, Charles would be

transferred... then I had my kids

and took time off to raise them...

and then when I decided to teach

again, no one would hire me 'cause

you can't count on a navy wife to

stick around. I finally decided I'd

start my own program -- Charles gave

me the money and I bought fifty

violins from this little Greek shop --

got started at a private school and

then...

BRIAN

Your husband ran off with your best

friend.

ROBERTA

She wasn't my "best" friend. She was

a friend.

(beat)

Charles is the last person you'd

think would cheat on me -- he never

broke a rule...

(a few beats)

I wake up one night -- it's like one

in the morning -- and he's not in

bed. I go outside and our neighbor --

this old Greek guy -- is sitting out

there, smoking a cigar, so I ask if

he's seen my husband. "He's taking a

walk with the other officer's wife,"

he says. "He takes a walk every night

with the other officer's wife."

ROBERTA

God, these are cold.

BRIAN

So you're just gonna wrap presents

and wait for him to come back?

ROBERTA

You sound like my mother.

BRIAN

That's not very sexy.

ROBERTA

Are you trying to be sexy or be my

friend?

BRIAN

A little of both.

BRIAN

You know, I know this really cool

lady who runs this elementary school --

I wrote a piece on her. It's a public

school, but it's alternative -- she

might be able to create some kind of

gig for you. Let me give her a call.

ROBERTA

Great!

BRIAN

(takes his last bite

of sandwich)

If she hires you, though, you have

to be willing to relocate.

ROBERTA

Where is it?

TAXI DRIVER

Welcome to East Harlem.

JANET

(looking at resume)

Aside from half a term in a private

school -- in Greece -- and a year

teaching chorus in Hawaii -- ten

years ago -- it doesn't look like

you've had any other teaching

experience.

ROBERTA

Well, not traditional teaching

experience. I've been doing private

lessons...

ROBERTA

It's not on there... I taught my

sons.

JANET

I'd like to help you, Mrs. Demetras.

Brian spoke highly of you and I told

him I'd consider starting a violin

class... But without the proper

qualifications, and without any

experience in an inner city school...

JANET

I'm very sorry.

JANET (O.S.)

Yes?

ROBERTA

I'm sorry to interrupt, but I wanted

you to meet my sons -- Nick, Lexi...

ROBERTA

Roberta Guaspari-Demetras.

JANET

This is Dennis Rausch, our music

teacher and program coordinator.

(beat)

Mrs. Demetras, didn't I make things

clear yesterday?

ROBERTA

If I could just show you something --

it'll only take a minute.

DENNIS

Are we having a talent show? I should

have brought my tap shoes.

LEXI

Will you hire her now?

JANET

How long have you boys been playing?

NICK

Since I was three.

LEXI

(contemplates, then)

Maybe since I was three and a half.

JANET

Your mom must be a good teacher.

NICK

(shrugs)

She's O.K.

JANET

(to Roberta)

If you could teach our students to

play like that, I'd be thrilled, but --

ROBERTA

I can. Any child can learn the violin.

DENNIS

Assuming they had the discipline.

ROBERTA

I'll teach them to have discipline.

JANET

A lot of our parents are struggling

to feed their kids and pay the rent --

they don't have time to help them

learn violin.

ROBERTA

They don't have to. If they can help,

great -- but these kids will be

committed. They'll practice on their

own, they'll help each other in the

classroom --

DENNIS

(with an edge)

I think I know these students, Miss

Demetras. Their attention span doesn't

go past do-re-mi. Maybe on a good

day, I can get them to "fa."

ROBERTA

You're underestimating them. They

can play as well as any other kids.

DENNIS

That I'd like to see.

ROBERTA

You will.

JANET

(to Roberta)

For now I'll put you down as a sub,

but I have to warn you -- even if it

works out, the Board may not let me

create a permanent position for you.

ROBERTA

That's O.K. I'll worry about that

later.

(with a grateful look)

Thank you.

DENNIS

(to Janet)

Well, I've already planned out the

whole term, and I can tell you right

now, there's no room for this!

Besides, where you gonna find money

for violins?

ROBERTA

You need violins?

ROBERTA

(gently)

Please do not open the cases, O.K.?

ROBERTA

Look, can everyone just settle down

and listen to me -- please?

ROBERTA

(starting to lose it)

Keep them closed! Please.

ROBERTA

(to the boys)

Did you hear what I just said?

ROBERTA

Put those down, please!

ROBERTA

(to the fencers)

Don't do that! Put the bows back in

the cases -- right now!

ROBERTA

Who's plucking?

ROBERTA

What have I been saying? Put that

away! Back in the case!

ROBERTA

O.K. Thank you. That's much better.

(takes another breath)

I'll be dividing you into five

classes, but for today --

ROBERTA

O.K. -- that's it! You! Stand up!

ROBERTA

You will be the first student who

will NOT be in my violin class. Out!

ROBERTA

I said OUT!

ROBERTA

Who else would like to be kicked out

of my class?

ROBERTA

Are you raising your hand because

you want to be kicked out?

DE SEAN

Yeah.

ROBERTA

Why?

DE SEAN

I don't wanna learn no stupid violin.

It's for wimps.

ROBERTA

Who told you that?

DE SEAN

I just know.

ROBERTA

What's your name?

BOY

De Sean.

ROBERTA

Well, De Sean -- you haven't given

me a good enough reason, so you're

staying.

ROBERTA

Anyone else?

NAEEM

Hey, I play pretty good.

ROBERTA

(to Naeem)

See how easy it is?

(to the class)

Maybe in the spring, we could have a

big concert for your families and

for the whole school.

(to the boy)

What's your name?

NAEEM

Naeem.

ROBERTA

(to class)

If you listen to me and do exactly

what I say, you're gonna sound

beautiful at the concert and you're

gonna be so proud of yourselves.

(to Naeem)

Good, Naeem. Your hand's staying

soft.

(to the class)

But if you don't listen to me, you'll

sound so bad that your own parents

will feel sick when they hear you.

They might even throw up.

ROBERTA (O.S.)

Come in.

ROBERTA

(referring to champagne)

What's this?

BRIAN

It's a toast.

(giving her a glass,

holding his up)

To Roberta, who's made it through

her first week.

ROBERTA

I don't know, Brian. I'm hanging on

by a thread there. Out of fifty kids,

maybe six are listening to me.

BRIAN

Look at the progress. Didn't you say

no one was listening to you on Monday?

ROBERTA

I really appreciate all you've done

for us. And I promise -- this weekend

I'll start looking for a place.

BRIAN

There's no rush.

ROBERTA

No, we've put you out enough. You're

supposed to be writing, not

babysitting for us.

(crosses to his desk,

flips through his

Vietnam book)

I've started your book. It's very

powerful.

BRIAN

Thank you.

ROBERTA

So what made you choose migrant

workers for your next book? I mean,

how do you know what to write about?

BRIAN

(kissing her neck)

I follow my gut, pay attention to

what I'm being drawn to...

ROBERTA

What are you doing?

BRIAN

I've been waiting to do that since

Mr. Baines' orchestra class.

ROBERTA

You didn't even notice me!

BRIAN

Sure I did. You used to ignore me

and it drove me wild.

ROBERTA

You had at least five different

girlfriends.

BRIAN

It didn't mean I had the one I wanted.

BRIAN

You're not a navy wife anymore...

ROBERTA

Yes I am... legally.

BRIAN

And is it a navy requirement that

you dress like it's the 1950's?

ROBERTA

I do not!

BRIAN

(goading her)

Who did you vote for in the last

election?

ROBERTA

What does that have to do with

anything?

BRIAN

Tell me.

ROBERTA

(hesitates, then)

I don't know. Charles filled out my

absentee ballot.

BRIAN

Oh my God -- it's even worse than I

thought!

(touching her hair)

Is this the same Roberta who got the

orchestra to strike until they gave

us new uniforms?

ROBERTA

That Roberta's not around anymore.

BRIAN

I don't believe that.

ROBERTA

I shouldn't.

BRIAN

Because?

ROBERTA

The boys --

BRIAN

They're sleeping.

ROBERTA

I know, but... I'm still married.

BRIAN

And what's your husband doing right

now?

ROBERTA

Oh shit -- the boys.

BRIAN (O.S.)

They're still sleeping.

ROBERTA

Where are you going?

BRIAN

Texas.

ROBERTA (O.S.)

What's in Texas?

BRIAN

Farm workers. I just got the call --

it came through -- my research grant!

It came through! Isn't that great?

ROBERTA

Today?

BRIAN

I've got a few families lined up

there, some in California --

ROBERTA

How long will you be gone?

BRIAN

Two, three months.

ROBERTA

What?

ROBERTA

I thought... I just thought you were

gonna be around. And then last night --

BRIAN

Whoa. Roberta -- last night was great

but did you think I was gonna marry

you in the morning?

ROBERTA

No! Of course not.

ROBERTA

It's just that... we just got here

and we're barely... I don't even

know where to buy groceries.

BRIAN

You're gonna be fine. You have a

job, a place to stay, your kids have

a school to go to -- and there's a

D'Agostino's around the corner.

ROBERTA

Congratulations.

ROBERTA

And what am I doing now?

NAEEM/GUADALUPE

Rosining the bow.

ROBERTA

Good. And what am I doing when I

turn this little screw?

(raising her voice)

Everyone stop talking. Right now!

ROBERTA

Naeem?

NAEEM

Tightening the horse hair.

ROBERTA

(touches the heel of

the bow)

And what do we call this?

ROBERTA

De Sean?

DE SEAN

Yeah?

ROBERTA

What do we call this?

DE SEAN

I don't know.

ROBERTA

Why not?

DE SEAN

I wasn't here.

ROBERTA

Yes you were but you weren't paying

attention! Do you want people to

think you're stupid?

ROBERTA

All right, Naeem -- tell them.

NAEEM

It's called the frog.

ROBERTA

Anyone remember what this is?

ROBERTA

Lucy! Do you like people snapping

their fingers when you're talking?

LUCY

Yeah!

ROBERTA

What is this called?

LUCY

The jeri curl?

DENNIS

C-C-C-C, D-D-D-D, E-E-E-E...

ROBERTA

Excuse me -- sorry to interrupt --

DENNIS

No talking!

ROBERTA

I'm supposed to take kids out of

Miss Cooper's classroom for my ten

o'clock class -- there's nobody there.

DENNIS

Miss Cooper's students have phys ed

on Tuesdays.

ROBERTA

But you scheduled them for violin.

DENNIS

You must have read the schedule wrong.

ROBERTA

(trying to remain

polite)

I don't think so.

DENNIS

Well, I can't solve this problem for

you right now.

(nods to his class)

I'm trying to teach.

ROBERTA

So am I.

LEXI

Can I bring a puppy for show and

tell tomorrow?

ROBERTA

Honey, we don't have a puppy.

NICK

Daddy said we could get one when we

moved back to America.

ROBERTA

How about your truck? I'll bet you're

the only one in school with a truck

from Greece.

NICK

When's Daddy coming back?

ROBERTA

Well, he's still on his tour, so

we'll just have to see but... It

shouldn't be too much longer.

LEXI

Is he gonna live with us and Brian?

ROBERTA

No, honey. We're just staying at

Brian's house for a little while.

ROBERTA

Good night, sweetie.

NICK

No! Leave it on.

ROBERTA

Now take the right foot and put it

on a tile. Good. Now with the other

foot take a tiny step forward and

put it on a line. Try to make a box

with your feet --

ROBERTA

Lucy! Would you like to leave the

class right now?

ROBERTA

You should feel very strong -- so

strong and balanced that if I wanted

to knock you over I couldn't.

ROBERTA

You see? If you're standing strong,

I can't even push you.

ROBERTA

De Sean! James! Quiet!

(as she crosses to

another student)

Does anyone know where Naeem is?

TANISHA

I saw him this morning but he's not

here.

ROBERTA

Yes, I know he's not here -- that's

why I'm asking.

ROBERTA

See how I pushed you? It means your

feet aren't centered.

ROBERTA

Can you bring over a chair?

(to Guadalupe)

It's probably better for you to sit.

ROBERTA

Where were you today, Naeem?

NAEEM

I can't be in violin class anymore.

ROBERTA

Why not?

NAEEM

My mother won't let me.

ROBERTA

What?

MRS. ADISA

My son's got more important things

to do than learn dead white men's

music.

ROBERTA

They're gonna learn "Twinkle Twinkle

Little Star"!

MRS. ADISA

How many Black classical composers

can you name? How many Black classical

violinists do you know?

ROBERTA

That doesn't mean it's the way it

should be. Naeem's learning to play

music -- and that makes him feel

good about himself. Why should it

matter who wrote it?

NAEEM

Please, Mom? Can't I be in the class?

MRS. ADISA

Look. I've seen this before. You

white women come up here and think

you can rescue our poor inner city

children who never asked to be rescued

in the first place. No thank you.

ROBERTA

Brian Turner's room, please.

ALICE

And which ocean is this?

ROBERTA

Excuse me... I'm here for the violin

students.

ALICE

(icy)

You're late.

ROBERTA

Just a couple of minutes -- I'm sorry.

ALICE

They're having a lesson now.

ROBERTA

But this is when they have violin

class!

ALICE

That's not my problem.

ROBERTA

I thought all the teachers agreed to

this.

JANET

In theory.

(to a student)

Adam! I want you in my office right

after lunch, you understand?

ADAM

What'd I do?

JANET

Think about it!

(to Roberta)

Whenever you pull kids out, it's a

disruption, plus it's extra work for

the teacher 'cause they have to fill

the kids in on what they missed.

Some teachers resent it.

ROBERTA

Well, can't you talk to them?

JANET

I took this off a second-grader this

morning. I'll help you Roberta --

but I can't hold your hand here.

JANET

A word of advice? When you're picking

up your students, go to Alice's

classroom first.

ROBERTA

So pretend you're driving a car and

I'm the policeman and I say STOP!

Thumb up, fingers straight up, flat

palm. Now you be policemen, but turn

your hand and make it say stop to

yourself.

DE SEAN

(to himself)

You're under arrest.

ROBERTA

Knock it off, De Sean!

(to all)

If you kids can't take this seriously,

I don't want you here. I'm teaching

you a difficult instrument because I

respect you and have faith that you

can learn it. But none of that matters

if you don't have respect for

yourself.

ROBERTA

Now turn your wrist so it's flat

against the fingerboard, and that's

how you'll set up your hand...

ROBERTA

Guadalupe! You've got the violin in

the wrong hand! How did that happen?

ROBERTA

Hello?

CHARLES (O.S.)

Hello, Bobbi.

ROBERTA

Where are you?

CHARLES (O.S.)

(calm, detached)

I'm back in the States. I'm at my

parents.

ROBERTA

Are you still with her?

CHARLES (O.S.)

No.

ROBERTA

(through tears)

We've missed you so much, Charles.

The boys... they can't wait for you

to come home... I know we'll have a

lot to work out and it won't be easy

right away, but we're gonna get

through this, you know? We're a family

and we belong together and --

CHARLES (O.S.)

(more emotive than

before)

Bobbi -- stop, O.K.? Just stop.

CHARLES (O.S.)

I want a divorce.

ROBERTA

What?

ROBERTA

But you said... you and Lana... you

said it was over.

CHARLES (O.S.)

It is.

(beat)

It's over between us too, Bobbi.

ROBERTA (O.S.)

He wouldn't even talk about it! No

explanations, no discussion...

BRIAN

I can't believe you were still holding

out hope. The guy hasn't called you

or the kids in three months -- I

thought you'd moved on.

ROBERTA

I never said that.

BRIAN

No? Maybe not with words.

ROBERTA

You know what? I shouldn't have called

you. This was a mistake.

BRIAN

No, no -- I'm sorry. Look, I know it

hurts, but you're gonna get through

this, Roberta -- you will.

ROBERTA

I'm moving back to my Mom's.

BRIAN

What? You're gonna quit teaching in

the middle of the term?

ROBERTA

I don't fit in there -- I'm not making

any progress with the kids...

BRIAN

What are you gonna tell Janet --

your husband left you and nothing

else matters?

ROBERTA

I don't know yet.

BOY

My mother gave it to me.

JANET

Why would she give you fifty dollars?

BOY

To buy breakfast.

JANET

Do you know how hard your mother

works? Do you think it's right for

you steal from her?

BOY

I didn't!

JANET

Well let's go call her right now and

ask her.

ROBERTA

I need to speak to you. It's

important.

JANET

It'll have to wait.

(to the boy)

Come on. In my office.

ROBERTA

Guadalupe? What are you doing here?

GUADALUPE

I can't get the stop sign.

ROBERTA

Honey, your teacher's probably looking

for you.

GUADALUPE

I can't come anymore. It's too hard.

ROBERTA

The violin is hard for everyone.

GUADALUPE

But everyone else is better than me.

I'll always be slow.

ROBERTA

Did you ever hear of Itzhak Perlman?

GUADALUPE

No.

ROBERTA

He's one of the greatest violinists

in the world, and he has problems

with his legs too. He walks with two

canes -- but he still makes the most

beautiful music.

GUADALUPE

And he sits down when he plays?

ROBERTA

He has to.

GUADALUPE

He was your student?

ROBERTA

No. But if he was, I'd tell him the

same thing I'm telling you. You

shouldn't quit something just because

it's hard.

GUADALUPE

But I can't stand strong.

ROBERTA

Standing strong doesn't only mean

using your legs. You can stand strong

on the inside too.

(beat)

Know what I mean?

JANET

You wanted to speak to me?

ROBERTA

Oh. Umm -- that's O.K. It's taken

care of.

LANDLADY

Is just for you and your boys?

ROBERTA

Yes.

LANDLADY

No husband? No boyfriend?

ROBERTA

No.

LEXI

Look what I made you, Mommy!

ROBERTA

(covering her

discomfort)

That is so beautiful!

ISABEL

Whatsa matter -- you got cooties?

ROBERTA

Apparently.

ISABEL

I'll take my chances.

(extends a hand)

Isabel Vasquez. Second grade.

ROBERTA

Roberta Demetras. I'm the --

ISABEL

Violin teacher. I know.

ROBERTA

Is it my imagination, or does everyone

hate me?

ISABEL

It's hard to fit in when you're doing

a special program. People figure

you're not gonna be here very long,

so why make the effort?

(beat)

It may take a while for folks to

warm up, but nobody hates you.

ROBERTA

(sotto)

What about Alice Crowley?

ISABEL

(sotto)

A) she thinks the violin's a waste

of time... and B) -- she's a bitch.

ROBERTA

And then there's Dennis.

ISABEL

The Music Man. You've had the bodacity

to threaten his private little empire --

not to mention the fact that you

messed up his sacred scheduling chart.

ROBERTA

How come you're being nice to me?

ISABEL

Ulterior motives. I want my daughter

in your class next year.

ROBERTA

If I'm here next year.

ISABEL

You will be.

NICK

In Greece, we could see the ocean.

Remember?

ROBERTA

I remember. And the fishing boats...

NICK

And the octopuses.

NICK

Is Daddy coming here soon?

ROBERTA

Well, that's something I've been

wanting to talk to you about. Daddy's

not gonna live with us anymore. You

and Lexi will have special times

when you stay with him, like at

Christmas.

NICK

Can you tell the birthday story?

ROBERTA

Don't you want to talk about what I

told you?

NICK

I want to hear the birthday story.

ROBERTA

It was the day of Grandpa's birthday,

and I was sad because he had died a

few months back.

NICK

But you knew I'd be born that day.

ROBERTA

So I packed a bag and got all ready --

NICK

And Daddy laughed.

ROBERTA

I said, "It's my father's birthday,

and the baby's gonna be born today."

NICK

He didn't believe you. But I was

born. The same day as Grandpa.

ROBERTA

It was a happy day.

NICK

Was Daddy happy too?

ROBERTA

Of course he was.

NICK

Then why is he leaving me?

ROBERTA

He's not leaving you, Nick. He loves

you and Lexi very much.

NICK

Then why can't he live here?

ROBERTA

(struggling)

It's very hard to explain... Sometimes

things happen between grown-ups...

and they just can't be together.

ROBERTA

Slow bows! Slow bows! Don't squeeze!

Stop! Everybody stop!

(to De Sean)

How much did you practice this week?

DE SEAN

My asthma -- it was very bad and I

had to go to the hospital.

ROBERTA

Again? You told me you went to the

hospital last week.

DE SEAN

Oh yeah. Maybe it was last week.

ROBERTA

Lucy -- you sounded the worst of

all. Have you practiced?

LUCY

No.

ROBERTA

Why not? You can't be in this class

if you don't practice!

LUCY

My grandma got mugged.

ROBERTA

Oh. I'm sorry. Is she O.K.?

LUCY

She died.

ROBERTA

I'm really sorry, Lucy.

(tries to get her

bearings)

Just do the best you can.

NAEEM

Hi, Roberta.

ROBERTA

Hi, Naeem. Can I talk to your mom

for a minute?

ROBERTA

Look, I didn't come up here to rescue

anybody. I'm a single mother and I

needed a job. And I know you think

you're protecting your son, but you're

not. I mean, what if Arthur Ashe's

mother had stopped him from playing

tennis because it's a "white man's

game"?

(beat)

The important thing is that when

Naeem plays music, his whole face

lights up. You should see him.

ROBERTA

We all have to take turns cleaning

up, O.K.?

ROBERTA

(to herself)

Yeah, right.

ROBERTA

First finger on the E! Three -- two --

one -- open!

(to a white girl with

pigtails)

Wrong string, Becky! We've done this

fourteen times! And look at your

nails! You're supposed to cut them

for violin class! O.K, everybody

stop! It sounds horrible! I can't

believe how bad it sounds!

ROBERTA

Is this an important question,

Tanisha?

TANISHA

Do you have two of those skirts?

ROBERTA

What?

TANISHA

You wore a skirt just like it on

Monday.

ROBERTA

You know, Tanisha -- I don't think

that's such an important question.

(to class)

O.K. Let's try --

MRS. ADISA

Naeem and I were wondering if he

could still be in the class.

ROBERTA

I'd love that.

(to Naeem)

You'll have a lot of catching up to

do. You think you can work that hard?

NAEEM

Yeah, I can.

ROBERTA

Maybe we can also arrange some private

lessons at my house.

MRS. ADISA

I wouldn't have the money for that.

ROBERTA

That's O.K.

(to Naeem)

Why don't you go grab one of my spare

violins?

ROBERTA

(to class)

Let's try it again.

ROBERTA

What are you playing?

LUCY

Twinkle.

ROBERTA

(to class)

Everyone stop!

(to Lucy)

Let me hear.

ROBERTA

Did someone teach you that?

LUCY

No. I made it up.

ROBERTA

That's really great, Lucy. I'm proud

of you.

ROBERTA

(to class)

All of you -- try it.

MRS. LAMB

You're shouting at them. All the

time.

ROBERTA

Not all the time. But if they don't

listen --

MRS. LAMB

Didn't you tell them that they were

making their parents sick?

ROBERTA

That wasn't exactly what I said --

MRS. LAMB

I'm raising Becky in a supportive

atmosphere. I don't send her to school

to be abused.

ROBERTA

I'm just trying to discipline them.

If they're gonna learn an instrument,

they need to take it seriously --

JANET

I think what Mrs. Lamb is trying to

say, Roberta, is that you're a little

too harsh. I'm sure you might be

able to soften some of your comments

to the children?

ROBERTA

Well, that was... that was pretty

good... that wasn't too bad...

DE SEAN

It wasn't? I thought we stunk.

ROBERTA

I wouldn't put it that way... You

all just need to practice a bit more.

(to James)

James, have you practiced this week?

ROBERTA

Can you please try a little harder

for next week?

ROBERTA

Good. Just do the best you can.

DE SEAN

Why you acting like that?

ROBERTA

Like what?

DE SEAN

Nice.

ROBERTA

Don't you want a nice teacher?

DE SEAN

I already got nice teachers. You

added some variety.

LUCY

Yeah. We like you better the way you

used to be.

ROBERTA

Oh.

(to Becky)

What about you, Becky?

BECKY

Yeah. This is even worse. You're

acting weird now.

ROBERTA

Well, then -- I take it back. You

all stunk.

ROBERTA

But don't tell your parents I said

so!

LEXI

Can't you come with us? Please?

ROBERTA

Honey, I told you. This is Daddy's

special time with you.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

I'll take good care of them.

ROBERTA

Who is it?

BRIAN (O.S.)

Santa Claus.

BRIAN

I'm back.

ROBERTA

O.K., enough goofing off -- back to

work.

BRIAN

You trying to kill me?

ASSUNTA

I was the only person in the whole

coffee shop not speaking Spanish.

ASSUNTA

You hear that? Gunshots! How you

gonna live here by yourself?

(calling)

Boys, come eat!

ROBERTA

I work in this neighborhood, Mama. I

want to live here.

ASSUNTA

What's your name?

LAWRENCE

Lawrence.

ASSUNTA

You hungry, Lawrence?

ASSUNTA

(to Brian)

Why did you let her buy this house?

BRIAN

Hey, your daughter does what she

wants -- or haven't you noticed?

ASSUNTA

I've noticed.

ASSUNTA

I still don't understand the rush.

ROBERTA

Having my own place will make me

feel like I'm really starting my

life again.

ASSUNTA

But if you invested your divorce

settlement, you could buy something

nice someday. It's bad enough that

you've been renting in this

neighborhood, but to lock yourself

into a mortgage --

ROBERTA

(snapping)

Mama, please. Just stop!

ROBERTA

Don't worry, O.K.? Besides, if things

keep going well, I'm sure eventually

Brian will move in with us.

ASSUNTA

How much do you know about this man?

ROBERTA

Brian's a good person, he's helped

me a lot, he's great with the boys --

since he got back to town, it's been

really sweet.

ASSUNTA

(with an attitude)

And how long has he been back?

ROBERTA

Two months.

ASSUNTA

That's not very long. Don't make the

same mistake twice, Bert. You barely

knew Charles when you married him.

ROBERTA

(defensive)

I don't get it -- you're ragging on

me about buying the house -- I would

think you'd want Brian to live with

me.

ASSUNTA

Not if he's the wrong person.

ROBERTA

Get ready, now -- we're coming up to

the fermata...

ROBERTA

Hold... Hold... Don't anybody move.

Now at the Spring Concert, the

audience is gonna be dying for that

next note -- but we'll make them

wait. As a matter of fact, I think

I'll go grab a cup of coffee.

ROBERTA

Well, O.K. But you have to promise

you'll all start together.

DE SEAN

Man. We'll never get that right.

ROBERTA

That's not a very nice thing to say

about your classmates.

(to class)

How many people think they can get

it right by the concert?

ROBERTA

I love you.

ROBERTA

Did you just laugh?

BRIAN

I'm sorry. It's just...

ROBERTA

What?

BRIAN

Why do people feel like the minute

something's going great, they gotta

name it?

(beat)

Once you name something, you snuff

the life out of it.

ROBERTA

Jesus, Brian. Do you still get away

with that crap? It's not the Sixties

anymore.

BRIAN

Well, maybe if you'd actually gone

through the Sixties, you'd know what

I'm talking about.

ROBERTA

Fine! We won't name it, we won't

talk about it, we'll act like we

have no feelings for each other

whatsoever!

BRIAN

I'm sorry. I'm being an asshole.

(sweetly teasing)

You can say you love me if you want.

ROBERTA

Forget it. I changed my mind.

ROBERTA

How's it coming, Ernie?

ERNIE

Well, if I could just remember what

I did here yesterday, I'd be moving

a whole lot faster.

(beat)

You look real pretty today, honey.

BRIAN

You're crazy. Why did you hire him?

ROBERTA

He needed a job. Besides, he's wired

all of East Harlem.

BRIAN

When? Fifty years ago?

ROBERTA

Why is there wallpaper on it?

MAN #1

That's how it comes.

ERNIE

Yep, that's how it comes now.

BRIAN

What the hell is this?

ROBERTA

Sheetrock.

BRIAN

You've gotta be kidding. Those ex-

cons you hired ripped this off --

and you too!

ROBERTA

Look -- this house is taking every

penny of my settlement. I can't afford

fancy union workers!

BRIAN

(throwing up his hands)

Fine. Do it your way.

JANET

I'm giving him a two-day suspension --

but next time he'll be expelled.

ROBERTA

There won't be a next time -- I

promise.

JANET

Have you noticed your son lately?

He's tied up in knots and he needs

help.

ROBERTA

Janet, kids fight. You're making too

much of this.

JANET

He was choking the kid.

(beat)

Nick's in trouble, Roberta. You need

to deal with it.

ROBERTA

(to students)

Keep playing, guys.

ROBERTA

You can watch when we're done.

NICK

It's my house! They don't live here --

I do!

ROBERTA

(sotto)

Nick honey -- the kids are real

nervous about the Spring concert.

You could probably give them some

pointers.

NICK

I don't feel like it.

ROBERTA

I said no.

BRIAN

Good catch Nick!

BRIAN

(mock sternly)

Uh-oh. You know what that means?

NICK

(through laughter)

Don't! Don't throw me in!

BRIAN

Whatsa matter? Afraid of a little

water? The ducks aren't afraid! Are

you a chicken or a duck?

NICK

Don't! Don't throw me!

BRIAN

Looks like you got yourself a chicken,

Roberta!

NICK

I'm not a chicken!

BRIAN

Well then you must be a duck!

LEXI

Throw me in the water, Brian! Do it

to me!

ROBERTA

You seem to be the only one who can

get Nick to laugh these days.

BRIAN

He misses his dad. I'm just a

surrogate.

ROBERTA

No -- I think Nick really likes you.

(taking his arm)

You know... we're all hoping you'll

move into the new house with us.

BRIAN

Whoa. Can we just slow down here a

minute? It's too much like getting

married.

ROBERTA

What's so bad about that?

BRIAN

That kind of commitment just isn't

realistic. I mean, how can we know

that you and I will even be able to

stand each other in five years?

ROBERTA

Well, we don't. But if two people

care about each other, they take a

chance.

BRIAN

And look what happened to you and

Charles.

ROBERTA

I'm not talking about Charles. I'm

talking about us.

BRIAN

Look, Roberta. Marriage is based on

a belief that one person can

completely meet another person's

needs. I just don't buy that.

ROBERTA

(carefully)

What are you saying? If there's some

need you have that I don't meet,

you'd go and get it "met" by someone

else?

BRIAN

I'm saying that it's the 80's and

it's a fantasy to think of marriage

lasting these days. One out of two

marriages ends in divorce!

ROBERTA

You didn't answer my question.

(beat)

If I don't meet all your needs, and

we're in a committed relationship --

forget marriage for a minute; I'm

just talking about a relationship --

would you go to someone else?

BRIAN

In theory, yes.

ROBERTA

In theory.

BRIAN

Roberta, we've got something good

right now -- that's the important

thing. Let's just keep it that way,

O.K.?

NICK (O.S.)

(whining)

Why can't he?

ROBERTA

He just can't, O.K.? Brian's at his

house tonight, and we're at ours.

NICK

Well then I wanna go to his house.

ROBERTA

Enough, Nick. Now why don't you and

your brother practice while I make

dinner.

NICK

I don't feel like practicing.

ROBERTA

Well do it anyway.

NICK

I wanna go to Brian's!

ROBERTA

Stop whining, and get your violin.

ROBERTA

What the hell are you doing?

NICK

The problem with you is you're mean

to everybody and then they don't

want to be with you!

ROBERTA

I've heard just about enough from

you, young man. Now set your violin

up properly and start practicing.

NICK

I hate the violin!

ROBERTA

You pick that violin up right now

and don't you ever ever --

NICK

It's all your fault! You made Daddy

leave and you're gonna make Brian

leave too! You're gonna be all alone

and I'll have to take care of you!

ROBERTA

Nick -- you don't have to take care

of me.

NICK

Then who's going to?

ROBERTA

I'll take care of myself -- and I'll

take care of you and Lexi. I promise.

NICK

You didn't try hard enough. You made

Daddy leave us.

ROBERTA

That's not true. I begged him not to

leave, but he didn't listen.

NICK

Why not?

ROBERTA

Your father met someone he liked

more than Mommy, and then --

NICK

Who?

ROBERTA

Lana. Remember our friends Lana and

Tom?

NICK

Is he gonna marry her now?

ROBERTA

No, but he's not coming back... to

me.

ROBERTA

I'll take care of you, Nick. You

too, Lexi. I promise. I'm not going

anywhere. We're still a family.

ROBERTA

(softly, to both)

I promise.

ROBERTA

What color is this?

PAINTER

White.

ROBERTA

I told you Eggshell.

PAINTER

Eggshells are white.

BRIAN

You're an idiot! I told you -- you

can't be your own contractor.

ROBERTA

You're right. I'm an idiot.

ROBERTA

Wake up, Ernie.

ROBERTA

You're fired.

ROBERTA

You're fired.

ROBERTA

You're fired.

BRIAN

That's more like it.

ROBERTA

You're fired too.

ROBERTA

No, Brian. I mean it. I need to be

with a man who can make a commitment

to me. I need that, and my sons need

that.

(beat)

So can you?

BRIAN

(hesitates, then)

Roberta --

ROBERTA

Get out.

WOMAN

That's the one Lucy wrote!

DISSOLVE TO:

ISABEL

C'mon everybody, settle down -- Janet

wants to talk to you.

JANET

Today's a very special day because

we're starting the tenth year of the

East Harlem Violin Program. This is

a wonderful opportunity for you, so

I want you to talk to your parents

about whether you'd like to try this.

ISABEL

My daughter took violin with Roberta

when she was your age, and now she's

in high school and she still talks

about how much she loved it.

DENNIS

Janet and I started this program

because we knew how much you kids

could benefit from it.

DENNIS

You should know, however, that the

violin is a difficult instrument.

JUSTIN

Who's that lady in the back?

JANET

That's Dorothea Van Hauften --

JUSTIN

Say what? What kinda name is that?

ISABEL

Justin -- sshh!

JANET

-- and she's taking pictures of

Roberta's classes for a magazine

article about music education.

JUSTIN

I wanna be in the magazine!

ISABEL

First things first, Justin. Roberta's

gonna explain to you about the

"lottery."

ROBERTA

I used to just teach fifty kids at

this school. But now I teach a hundred

and fifty kids at three East Harlem

schools and there's so many children

who want to take violin classes that

we have to have a lottery.

VANESSA

Can I be in the class?

ISABEL

Roberta's explaining that. Just

listen.

ROBERTA

After your parents sign your

permission slips, I'm gonna put them

in a sack, and I'll pick fifty names

from each school.

ROBERTA

So everyone bring in your slips by

Friday, and I'll come back and tell

you who's in violin class.

ISABEL

Remember, she's just picking names

from a hat. It doesn't mean that

anyone's better than anyone else.

RAMON

(to Roberta)

I really really hope that I get in

the class.

ROBERTA

I hope so too.

RACHEL

How come you guys don't play the

violin?

LEXI

Well, picture her being your teacher

and your mother.

ROBERTA

Hi Rachel. Be right with you.

ROBERTA

(to Nick)

You're gonna practice upstairs?

NICK

No. I'm done.

ROBERTA

Already? You've barely practiced.

NICK

What -- are you timing me with a

stop watch? Why don't you pick on

Lexi for a change?

LEXI

'Cause I'm perfect.

LEXI

(to Rachel)

Have a good lesson.

LEXI

I'll be back in a couple of hours.

ROBERTA

Be careful.

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Can I try your bike?

LEXI

I'm gonna be leaving pretty soon.

HENRY

Just wanna take it for a spin.

LAWRENCE

C'mon, Henry -- he don't want to

loan you his bike.

HENRY

I didn't hear him say that.

(to Lexi)

Is that true? Did you say that?

ROBERTA

Vibrato... don't wiggle your wrist.

RACHEL

Dang! I can't get that right.

ROBERTA

You almost have it.

RACHEL

Almost isn't good enough.

ROBERTA

Did I turn you into such a

perfectionist?

RACHEL

No. I came that way.

ROBERTA

(smiles, then)

Just as long as you get it right for

your Julliard audition.

RACHEL

What?

ROBERTA

I've recommended you for a gifted

kids scholarship.

ROBERTA

Where's the bike?

LEXI

Mom, please. Don't do this to me!

NICK

C'mon, Mom -- why don't you let me

handle this?

ROBERTA

Are we getting closer, Lawrence?

LAWRENCE

It's the next block up.

LEXI

(to Roberta)

You don't have to do this. I'll pay

you back.

ROBERTA

How? It took me six months to save

up for it.

NICK

I'll help him, O.K.? We'll both pay

you back.

LEXI

Or we'll ask Dad -- he'll help us

out.

ROBERTA

Yeah, right.

LAWRENCE

O.K., slow down. It's the second one

on the right.

NICK

C'mon Mom, let's get out of here.

ROBERTA

Lock the doors.

LEXI

I'm dead. She's gonna get me killed.

NICK

I'm coming with you!

ROBERTA

No. Get back in the car and stay

with the boys.

LAWRENCE

Don't take the stairs!

OLD WOMAN (O.S.)

Yeah?

ROBERTA

I'm a school teacher. Henry has taken

my son's bicycle and I want it back.

OLD WOMAN

Henry's not here.

ROBERTA

Well you tell Henry that if he returns

the bike, I won't have to notify the

police -- or his school principal.

Although since I am a teacher, it

would be very easy for me to do that.

OLD WOMAN

He's not home. He doesn't get home

till late.

ROBERTA

How late?

OLD WOMAN

Not till after ten.

ROBERTA

I'll be on the steps of CPE 1 at 11

P.M. I'll be waiting for him.

LEXI

You're crazy. He's not gonna show.

NICK

You think he actually cares that

you're a teacher? You think he even

goes to school?

LEXI

C'mon, Mom -- let's just go.

ROBERTA

It's only five after eleven.

HENRY

I was just borrowing it.

ROBERTA

Shandra Wilson.

ROBERTA

Justin Brady.

ROBERTA

Vanessa Klein.

ROBERTA

O.K. One more name...

ROBERTA

Leonard Hood.

LEONARD

It's too hard! I don't wanna do it!

ISABEL

Don't you even wanna try, Leonard?

LEONARD

(through tears)

I don't want to!

ROBERTA

Well, O.K. then. I'll pick someone

else.

(she picks a name)

Ramon Olivas.

RAMON

This is to inform you that your child,

Ramon Olivas, has been chosen by

lottery to be in the violin program.

CONCEPCION

You happy?

CONCEPCION

I think you're happy.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

(German accent)

Does that really work?

ROBERTA

No. But I keep trying. And maybe

someday the school will give me a

parking space!

DOROTHEA

Wait --

ROBERTA (O.S.)

God, these are great.

DOROTHEA

Those copies are for you.

ROBERTA

Thank you. Can I... pay for you them?

DOROTHEA

Don't be silly. Besides -- you'll

need your money for parking tickets.

DOROTHEA

What you're doing for these children

is wonderful. My husband's a violinist --

he was quite impressed when I told

him about you.

ROBERTA

What's his name?

DOROTHEA

Arnold Steinhardt.

ROBERTA

Of the Guarneri String Quartet?

DOROTHEA

Stay in touch. Let us know when the

kids have a concert.

RACHEL

Don't be late for violin class! I

hear the teacher's really mean.

ROBERTA

Amanda, what did I tell you about

wearing cowboy boots to violin class?

They're too slippery!

ROBERTA

Relax your two, Simon...

ROBERTA

Your stop sign has to be up, Kenny!

Stephanie, it doesn't look like you

ever had a lesson with me!

ROBERTA

Where's your violin, Carlos?

CARLOS

It's coming.

ROBERTA

What, is it walking here by itself?

ROBERTA

Your buddies giving you a hard time?

CARLOS

Look, it's just not cool. You wouldn't

understand.

ROBERTA

Hey, you want your sister to carry

your violin, that's fine. But is she

practicing for you too? Because

lately, that's how it sounds.

CARLOS

I've been busy! I've been --

ROBERTA

I'm not interested! Just get here on

time, and commit to this class or I

don't want you in here, you

understand?

ROBERTA

You're a good violinist, Carlos --

and it's definitely not "cool" to

waste your own talent.

MANUELO

Why didn't you show it to me?

CONCEPCION

It just needed one parent's signature.

MANUELO

(with some Spanish)

Well, I'm his parent and I don't

give permission! He should be playing

baseball, not the violin!

CONCEPCION

It makes him happy.

BOY #1

(loudly)

Ooh, check out little Miss Violinhead.

GIRL

She carry that violin with her all

the time 'cause she think she special.

RACHEL

I am special.

RACHEL

(nonchalant)

So I heard from Julliard.

ROBERTA

And?

RACHEL

They said yes!

ROBERTA

So when you take the violins home,

tape your music to the wall directly

in front of your nose so you can

play with perfect posture. Your

parents are gonna be so excited to

hear you play!

PEDRO

(yelling)

Ramon! How many cats you killing in

there?

ROBERTA

More bow! To the frog! Myesha, your

stop sign line should be touching.

Don't let it wiggle! You're on the

wrong string, Justin! And look at

your feet!

ROBERTA

Where's your violin?

VANESSA

I forgot.

ROBERTA

Goodbye! And you may be dropped.

ROBERTA

Look at those nails, Rosario!

ROBERTA

I see you over there, Myesha.

ROBERTA

(to Ramon)

You're doing much better.

RAMON

Drop dead, Justin!

JUSTIN

It was a accident!

RAMON

Was not!

ROBERTA

Ramon, I don't like that kind of

talk. Justin, pick up his stand,

now! Our spring concert is in three

weeks and you might not be in it. Is

that what you want?

ROBERTA

Mr. Klein? I'm gonna have to drop

Vanessa from the class if she keeps

forgetting her violin.

MR. KLEIN

(sotto)

She's going back and forth between

houses. My wife and I split up.

ROBERTA

(softening)

Oh. I'm sorry.

ROBERTA

Vanessa, maybe you could write down

for your Mom and Dad which days are

violin days.

VANESSA

(almost in tears)

The tape doesn't stick.

ROBERTA

What?

VANESSA

I taped the music to the wall at my

Mom's house and then I took it to my

Dad's house and it doesn't stick

anymore.

ROBERTA

Well you know what? That's an easy

problem to solve.

ROBERTA

Now you have two, O.K.? One for each

house.

RAMON

You wanna hear my new song, Papa?

MANUELO

(in Spanish)

Not right now.

CONCEPCION

We made mistakes with Pedro and

Ernesto and we can't fix them now,

but Ramon -- he works so hard. The

violin makes him want to be good at

everything.

ROBERTA

(to Isabel)

What happened?

RAMON

You go to heaven... You go to hell...

You go to hell... heaven...

TOUSSAINT

My grandpa died and my uncle, so

that makes six.

SHANDRA

I know more than that. At least seven

people... maybe even nine.

ROBERTA

(quietly)

I know that you've all heard the bad

news about Justin.

MYESHA

I didn't hear.

TOUSSAINT

There was a drive-by shooting by his

house and he got shot on accident

and he died.

ROBERTA

Does anyone want to talk about it?

RAMON

(angry)

I think we should just play violin.

CONCEPCION

Roberta! Come in.

ROBERTA

I came by to check on Ramon.

CONCEPCION

(confused)

Why?

ROBERTA

Didn't he tell you what happened at

school?

CONCEPCION

Roberta wants to talk to you, O.K.?

RAMON

Did that sound O.K.?

ROBERTA

Yeah, it did.

ROBERTA

I've been thinking about Justin.

Remember how mad I got the last time

I saw him?

RAMON

Yeah. You got very strict with him.

ROBERTA

It wasn't always so easy to be nice

to him, you know?

RAMON

You think Justin's in heaven or hell?

ROBERTA

Heaven.

RAMON

I told him to drop dead.

ROBERTA

Justin didn't die because of what

you said. I promise.

RAMON

How do you know?

ROBERTA

I don't think you're that powerful,

do you? I mean, if you had such

powers, just imagine what kind of

violin player you'd be by now!

RAMON

Yeah. I'd be better than you!

ROBERTA

It's O.K. to cry, you know.

RAMON

Not for a man.

ROBERTA

My boys still cry and they're big,

strong young men now.

(beat)

I bet Justin's daddy cried.

ROBERTA

Nick, Lexi! Get down here right now!

NICK

We were just trying to help!

ROBERTA

This is humiliating!

NICK

Mom, no one knows it's you! I mean,

you don't even have to read them if

you don't want to.

(glances at pile)

Although obviously, a lot of guys

are interested in dating you.

ROBERTA

No. A lot of guys are interested in

dating you and Lexi.

(beat)

What did you say about me, anyway?

NICK

"Beautiful musician, late 40's, tired

of playing solo --

LEXI

-- seeks a healthy, stable, attractive

man who's not afraid of a duet with

a strong, independent woman.

NICK

My violin playing will feed your

soul...

LEXI

...And my lasagna will be music to

your palate."

ROBERTA

Oh, my God.

LEXI

Did you catch all the music metaphors?

ROBERTA

Don't you think it's a little weird

that you're trying to get your mother

a date?

NICK

Don't you think it's a little weird

that you're not even interested in

dating?

ROBERTA

Boys, look. Number one -- even if I

wanted to date, I don't have time.

And number two -- I've got my

teaching, I've got you guys -- that's

all I need.

LEXI

(to Nick)

I really thought she'd like the music

metaphors.

ROBERTA

I think you're flat, Nick.

NICK

I'm not flat.

ROBERTA

The B sounded flat.

NICK

Just play the violin, Mom. I'll take

care of the cello.

LEXI

You nervous, Mom?

ROBERTA

No. I'm fine.

DAN

Hi. I'm Dan Paxton.

DAN

(shaking her hand)

Wow. An honest woman.

ROBERTA

Honest?

DAN

Your ad. When you said you were

beautiful, you were telling the truth.

NICK

Make sure you're home by midnight,

young lady.

LEXI

Ten bucks he tries to kiss her.

NICK

That's a no-brainer. Of course he'll

try. The real question is whether

she'll let him.

LEXI

O.K. -- ten bucks she lets him.

NICK

You're on.

DAN

I had a lot of fun tonight.

ROBERTA

Yeah, I did too.

DAN

I have a confession -- I've never

answered an ad before. I did it on a

dare.

ROBERTA

Well, I have a confession -- my boys

placed the ad behind my back.

ROBERTA

Look, Dan -- I went along with this

'cause it's been a while. Quite a

while... And I had a very nice time...

but I'm not sure if I'm ready to get

involved with anyone right now.

DAN

(deadpan)

Does this mean I don't get any

lasagna?

ROBERTA

Why are you guys still up?

NICK

(all innocence)

Why? Is it late?

ROBERTA

Good try, Nick.

LEXI

So how was it?

ROBERTA

Well... he's nice.

NICK

"Nice"? As in "let's just be friends"

nice?

ROBERTA

I don't know yet. We'll see.

NICK

There's still a lot more letters.

ROBERTA

Good night, Nick.

LEXI

Hey, Mom -- can you loan me ten

dollars?

ROBERTA

Guys, I'm so sorry -- I got stuck

over at CPE 2...

ROBERTA

What's going on? Where are all your

violins?

RAMON

We heard you got fired.

ROBERTA

What?!

ROBERTA

Is it true?

JANET

Why don't you come in my office?

ROBERTA

It's true? You're firing me?

JANET

It's not me, Roberta. The Board of

Ed. cut the budget, the District had

to comply, and as of the end of this

term, the violin program has been...

excessed.

ROBERTA

Excessed.

(beat)

They specifically said that my violin

program has to go.

JANET

They've slashed the budget -- music

and art programs got hit the worst.

ROBERTA

What about Dennis' classes?

DENNIS

I'm tenured, Roberta.

ROBERTA

When was this decided?

JANET

Things happened very quickly... I

wanted to tell you myself --

ROBERTA

(reeling)

I just... I can't even believe this

is happening!

DENNIS

Why not? You're a sub. Your position

has never been permanent.

JANET

Shut up, Dennis! You're not helping!

(softly, to Roberta)

Come into my office, please.

ROBERTA

There's gotta be a way to fight this!

JANET

Fight it with what? I don't have any

other extra programs to give them

instead.

ROBERTA

Oh, I see. So after ten years, after

fourteen hundred children have learned

to play the violin, this is just an

"extra program."

JANET

You know I don't feel that way and

you know damn well I've been standing

by you all these years! You think I

haven't noticed what you've done for

these kids?

ROBERTA

Then do something!

JANET

(points to her phone)

I've been on this phone for the past

three days trying to "do something" --

the District office can't even stand

the sound of my voice. Believe me,

there are some people around here

I'd much rather get rid of. But as

far as the Board's concerned, violin

classes are not a priority.

JANET

I don't have the power here, Roberta.

I'm so sorry.

ROBERTA

sitting at the kitchen table with a

glass of wine, her face ashen.

NICK

What happened?

ROBERTA

I'm a good teacher. I've worked so

hard to give these kids something to

be proud of.

LEXI

I'm so sorry, Mom. I can't believe

they did this to you.

ROBERTA

It's like when my father got killed.

For twenty years, he followed every

safety rule the factory had, and

then someone else flips the wrong

switch...

(she chokes up)

It's not fair. You do everything

right and then...

NICK

It's the wrong analogy. You couldn't

do anything about Grandpa's death.

It was irreversible. This isn't.

ROBERTA

Tell that to the Board of Education.

NICK

Let me ask you something. Why did

you risk your life for a bicycle?

ROBERTA

I did not risk my life.

NICK

Of course you did! That building?

Threatening Henry? And for what --

two hundred dollars?

ROBERTA

No. Not for that.

LEXI

Then why?

ROBERTA

When someone steals something that

belongs to my kids, I'm not gonna

sit back and let that happen!

ROBERTA

Guys -- you need to think about this.

If I try to fight this -- with no

salary coming in -- I could lose the

house, screw up your college plans...

It would be a lot safer to just go

out tomorrow and get a job in a

private school.

LEXI

Yeah, but is that where you really

want to be?

ROBERTA

(to the audience)

The beautiful concert that you just

heard could be the last concert of

the East Harlem Violin Program. The

Board of Education and the District

Superintendent don't think that music

is important for our children. But

they're wrong -- and they're in for

a fight.

ROBERTA

Someone's early.

JANET

Hello, Assunta. How are you?

ASSUNTA

I'd be a lot better if my daughter

had a job next year.

ROBERTA

Ma!

JANET

(to Assunta)

I would too.

JANET

(to Roberta)

Sorry I'm early, but I figured we'd

need time to set up.

ROBERTA

Mama, why don't you take Allegra out

for a walk?

JANET

You are having a meeting here tonight,

right? Parents and teachers?

ROBERTA

Well, yes, but ...

JANET

Take it from me. If you want to get

parents to help you with something,

you have to feed them.

JANET

You have a cutting board for these?

JANET

(as she continues to

unpack)

And if you think parents are bad,

teachers are even worse, no offense.

If you don't feed them, you never

get anything extra out of them. That's

why I got this.

JANET

Entenmann's gets them every time.

JANET

What? Don't tell me you expected me

to bring something homemade.

ROBERTA

(as she takes the

cake from her)

Well, no... I --

JANET

Good. Because take it from me -- my

own family begs me to stay out of

the kitchen.

ROBERTA

What I didn't expect was for you to

be here.

JANET

Why not? We've gotta figure out a

way to fight this.

(as she arranges

crackers on a plate)

After ten years, Roberta, I can't

imagine walking through those hallways

and not hearing that off-key,

screechy, scratchy, nails-on-the-

blackboard violin music.

JANET

What do you think? Cut it into slices

now, or leave it whole?

ROBERTA

Let's cut it now. It'll be less messy.

ISABEL

Don't they realize how much this

program helps the kids?

MR. ADAMS

Simon's our third child to study

with Roberta. James is pre-med,

April's valedictorian -- now that

says something!

MR. KLEIN

I think we should inundate the Board

and the District with letters.

JANET

You're wasting your time. The Board

and the District are not gonna pay

for this program, no matter how many

letters they get.

ISABEL

What if we raise the money ourselves?

JANET

I can't see how they'd object to

that.

CONCEPCION

Well once that newspaper article

comes out, that should help bring in

money.

BEVERLY

Yeah, but what if it doesn't? For

all we know, it's gonna be buried on

the back page. Besides, who says

anyone's gonna give a damn about our

kids?

DOROTHEA

(to Roberta)

What if you do a benefit concert? We

can raise a batch of money from ticket

sales, and then the concert itself

could be great publicity. There's

word of mouth... you could get

reviewed...

ROBERTA

It better be a good concert!

ROBERTA

We have to offer something more than

me and the kids.

(to Dorothea)

Do you think maybe your husband would

perform with us?

DOROTHEA

(slyly)

I'm sure I could persuade him with a

little pillow talk. And maybe he can

get another violinist too -- Itzhak

Perlman, perhaps.

ROBERTA

That would be fantastic.

DOROTHEA

We could rent a place like the 92nd

Street Y -- it's perfect for this.

It seats about nine hundred people

and if we charge between fifty and a

hundred a ticket --

ISABEL

(to Roberta)

We could probably raise enough to

reinstate your program for a year.

JANET

Sounds like a plan.

ROBERTA

(half to herself)

It better be a good concert.

DAN

Take your pick.

ROBERTA

Kids, listen to me -- it's really

important that you don't look at the

camera and you try to act as natural

as possible.

DENNIS

Who authorized this?

ROBERTA

Janet.

DENNIS

Well Janet's not here today and I

want these people out of here.

DENNIS

Turn that off, you hear me?

ROBERTA

Why are you doing this? We're not

bothering anyone.

DENNIS

You're disrupting school and I want

them out of here -- now.

ROBERTA

You still don't get it, do you? I

don't care if you hate me, Dennis --

that's your business. But think about

the students for once. Every time

you interfere, you're not hurting me --

you're hurting them.

DENNIS

Get these people out of here or I'm

calling the police.

ROBERTA

Go right ahead, call them. That'll

look real good on the eleven o'clock

news.

RAMON

I don't hear no sirens.

ROBERTA

I'm from a blue collar family, and

if it weren't for the lessons I got

in public school, I never would have

learned the violin.

INTERVIEWER (O.S.)

How does it make you feel to lose

your violin program?

SHANDRA

It makes us sad!

RAMON

Yeah, like we're never gonna have no

more violin lessons --

VANESSA

And it's bad because... because we

love violin class.

ROBERTA

Yes, I've gotten offers from two

private schools, but this is where I

want to be.

DOROTHEA (O.S.)

Arnold, these kids need help.

ARNOLD

Didn't we send them a donation?

DOROTHEA

They need something bigger. And you

can't just write a check -- you have

to get involved.

ARNOLD

Involved how?

ARNOLD

Uh-oh.

ROBERTA

Listen up, everyone! Quiet down!

ROBERTA

You are my very best beginner and

advanced violin students and I've

chosen you to play in Fiddlefest

because I trust that you can handle

the pressure. It's gonna be a lot of

work -- a lot. Right now, we've sold

some tickets, but I'm not gonna be

back here in the fall if the audience

storms out of their seats, demanding

a refund!

ROBERTA

Rachel's gonna be my lieutenant and

I expect you to listen to her.

RAMON

Bach's "Minuet One"?

ROBERTA

People are gonna be paying good money

for this concert -- we're not just

gonna play "Twinkle."

(handing out papers)

I'm passing out a contract that you

and your parents need to sign.

CARLOS

Every Saturday and Sunday?

ROBERTA

Plus night time rehearsals during

the week. There's only six weeks

till the concert, so classes in school

won't be enough.

ROBERTA

Come to think of it, we'll probably

also need to meet before school.

ROBERTA

You've heard of Navy Seal Training?

Well, this is gonna be Roberta String

Training.

ROBERTA

Oh my god! Naeem! De Sean!

(hugs them)

Guadalupe!

ROBERTA

Lucy? Is that you?

ROBERTA

Kids, these are four of my very first

violin students and I've asked them

to play in the concert with us.

(to the alumni)

I was just telling them how hard

they're gonna have to work.

DE SEAN

(to class)

Take it from me -- this lady don't

lie. Y'all are gonna work your butts

off.

TEAMMATE #1

Hey Carlos! Where ya goin'? We got a

game, remember?

CARLOS

Yeah, I know, but... I can't make

it.

TEAMMATE #1

What you talkin' about?

CARLOS

I just can't make it.

TEAMMATE #2

You got a date with the violin

teacher?

CARLOS

Yeah. I do.

ROBERTA

Frog! Frog! I need more accents on

the down beat! More bow! More!

ROBERTA

Stop! Stop!

(they do so)

You sound horrible! Isn't anyone

practicing?

CARLOS

How can we practice? We're rehearsing

all the time.

ROBERTA

(to Stephanie)

You think this is funny, Stephanie?

(to all of them)

You think the four hundred people

who've bought tickets so far will

think it's funny too? You think Itzhak

Perlman will think it's funny that

he's donating his time and you're

all gonna stink?

ROBERTA

Am I boring you, Vanessa?

VANESSA

No. It's 7:30 in the morning. I'm

just tired.

ROBERTA

There's no time to be tired.

(to all, getting her

violin in position)

Let's try it again.

ROBERTA

I must have been crazy to agree to

this. They're never gonna be ready.

And you should hear the Bach Double!

A disaster. So the good news is

tickets are selling like hot cakes,

but the bad news is that the kids

sound like shit.

DOROTHEA

There's more bad news... We've lost

the Y.

ROBERTA

What?!

DOROTHEA

They had a flood -- a water heater

burst... The concert hall was damaged

and they've cancelled all events.

ROBERTA

Until when?

DOROTHEA

"Until further notice."

ROBERTA

This can't happen! We've sold tickets!

We've done publicity! The concert's

in three weeks!

DOROTHEA

I've been on the phone all morning

calling other theaters. Nothing's

available.

ROBERTA

Just keep looking.

ROBERTA

Stop! Someone's playing the wrong

notes! And you shouldn't need your

music anymore! Except for the Bach

Double, everything has to be memorized

by next rehearsal!

ROBERTA

And you sound like you're

sleepwalking. Your heart's not even

in it.

VANESSA

Maybe 'cause we don't have a place

for the concert.

ROBERTA

Well, you're right. This might all

be for nothing. So we can either

keep on rehearsing in case we find a

place -- or we can just... give up.

DE SEAN

Am I hearing right? Did you use the

words "give up"?

(to the students)

Let's take a vote. How many of you

want to give up?

GUADALUPE

See? You taught us well.

ROBERTA

What about in the Bronx?

NICK

There's nothing.

(beat)

Why don't you just do it in one of

the schools? It'll be a lot smaller

but --

ROBERTA

We won't make enough money.

LEXI

What about postponing it?

ROBERTA

Itzhak and Arnold are booked all

summer.

DOROTHEA (O.S.)

It's Dorothea.

DOROTHEA

I have good news -- really good news.

Arnold got a call from his friend

Wally Scheur who heard about us losing

the Y and wanted to see how he could

help -- and then Wally had this

brilliant idea and called his friend

Isaac Stern and it's all arranged!

We have a new place for Fiddlefest!

ROBERTA

Where?

DOROTHEA

Carnegie Hall.

ROBERTA

(panicked)

Carnegie Hall?

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Incredible sound in this room, no?

ROBERTA

Oh my god -- Isaac Stern.

ISAAC STERN

You must be Roberta.

ROBERTA

Thank you so much for helping us.

ISAAC STERN

(looking out at the

hall)

Would you believe in 1960, they tried

to tear this place down? They wanted

to replace it with a bright red

skyscraper -- we called it "the red

terror."

ROBERTA

You're kidding.

ISAAC STERN

We had to fight like hell, but with

a lot of help, we saved Carnegie

Hall.

ISAAC STERN

If it's all right with you, I'd like

to play in your concert. Maybe bring

a couple of friends...

ROBERTA

Yes, of course! That would be great!

ISAAC STERN

Don't give up.

ROBERTA

I just don't see how I'm gonna do

this. It's huge. It's gigantic! It's

Carnegie Hall! And listen to this:

now Isaac Stern wants to play with

us -- Diane Monroe, Michael Tree --

there's other people calling --

DAN

That's fantastic!

ROBERTA

Fantastic? I'll never get the kids

up to speed in time, I'll never get

myself up to speed. I'm gonna be

playing side by side with the world's

greatest violinists.

DAN

And "the world's greatest violinists"

are playing side by side with you

because they want to help you win

this fight.

ROBERTA

Yes, but... you don't understand.

Maybe there's a good reason why I

never made it as a violinist -- maybe

I just can't cut it. I keep blaming

it on not having enough early

training, but if I were talented, if

I had a gift --

DAN

But you do have a gift. You're gonna

put thirty East Harlem kids on stage

at Carnegie Hall not because they're

prodigies, but because you got them

to stick with something that's hard

as hell and to strive for excellence --

which, by the way, I certainly wasn't

striving for when I was their age.

Not to mention the other ten years'

worth of students whose lives were

changed because of you. That's your

talent, Roberta.

ROBERTA

I'm scared.

DAN

I know.

(beat)

And by the way, I happen to think

you're a pretty good violinist too.

ROBERTA

You've barely heard me play.

DAN

I've heard enough to know you're

gonna do just fine.

DAN

Besides, no one's gonna be paying

attention to your playing anyway.

CARLOS

Teacher's late. I think she should

be dropped, don't you?

RAMON

Yeah. I don't think we should let

her play in Fiddlefest!

CARLOS

More bow! To the frog! You sound

terrible! I can't believe how terrible

you sound!

CARLOS

You're gonna make everyone in Carnegie

Hall sick to their stomachs! That's

right, they're gonna pay a thousand

dollars a ticket and you're gonna

make them throw up on their gowns

and tuxedos!

ROBERTA

(in all seriousness)

If you're gonna imitate me, do it

right.

(corrects his posture)

Shoulders back. Violin higher. Check

your feet. There.

(beat)

G'head, Carlos. Continue.

CARLOS

No, that's O.K. You can take it from

here.

ROBERTA

He's right, by the way. You do sound

terrible, and you are gonna make

everyone in Carnegie Hall sick to

their stomachs.

RACHEL

I need to talk to you.

ROBERTA

(to kids)

I'll be right in. Start on Minuet

One.

(to Rachel)

What's wrong?

RACHEL

We're moving away.

ROBERTA

What? Where are you moving?

RACHEL

(looking downward)

It's a secret... My father... he's

been hurting my mom... We have to

leave.

ROBERTA

(gently)

Has he been hurting you too?

RACHEL

I'm sorry about Julliard... and the

concert.

ROBERTA

Keep it. Take it with you.

RACHEL

No... I don't want to play anymore.

ROBERTA

What?! You can't give up violin,

Rachel -- it's a part of you. A very

important part.

ROBERTA

Please honey. Just take it.

RACHEL

I don't want to.

ROBERTA

No, no, no! Accent the up bow after

the slurred notes and then it'll get

you off of those slurred notes! You

Double Concerto kids need to be

working harder! This is the grand

finale of the concert! You're each

gonna be sharing a music stand with

one of the world's greatest

violinists!

ROBERTA

I think we should forget the Bach

Double.

(to the other kids)

And you guys are never gonna get

Minuet One. I think we should drop

that too.

VANESSA

No! We can do it, Roberta!

CARLOS

And we'll get the Bach Double. We

will.

NAEEM

It's gonna be O.K., Roberta.

ROBERTA

(vulnerable)

You think?

ROBERTA

O.K...

(not believing it)

It's gonna be O.K.

ROBERTA

Nick -- did you feed Allegra?

NICK

(fixing Lexi's tie)

Yes, Mom.

ROBERTA

Lexi, can you make sure the charts

are still in my bag?

LEXI

I already checked, Mom.

ROBERTA (O.S.)

Check again, please. And look for my

repair kit too.

ASSUNTA

Bert, which earrings you want?

ROBERTA

Nick? Get two more violins.

NICK

You've already got two -- how many

emergencies can there be?

ROBERTA

Get three more. And make sure a couple

of them are half-size.

ROBERTA

Lexi -- can you call about the car

again?

LEXI

Mom, they're not gonna forget to

send a car!

NICK

What are you doing?

ROBERTA

Just straightening a little.

NICK

You're insane, you know that?

(grabs the pillow)

Finish getting dressed!

ROBERTA (O.S.)

SHIT!

ROBERTA

Can you believe this?

ROBERTA

It can't be time! Is it time?

ASSUNTA

I'll sew it in the car.

LEXI

See? I told you they'd send a car.

ROBERTA

Thank you, Mama.

ASSUNTA

Don't worry about it. You rip -- I

sew.

ROBERTA

Not just for that.

(beat)

Thank you for getting me out of bed.

ASSUNTA

Don't thank me -- thank Charles.

ROBERTA

Charles?!

ASSUNTA

If that jerk hadn't of left you,

none of this would've happened.

ROBERTA

Thank you, Charles.

ROBERTA

Where's Vanessa? Has anyone seen

Vanessa?

JANET

I'll call her house.

BRIAN

Congratulations.

ROBERTA

Thank you...

BRIAN

I knew you'd get here sooner or later.

I'm glad I'm here to see it.

ROBERTA

I am too.

GUADALUPE

Excuse me, Mr. Perlman?

GUADALUPE

(extends a hand)

I'm Guadalupe. I've wanted to meet

you for a long time.

ITZHAK PERLMAN

A pleasure to meet you, Guadalupe.

CARLOS

You nervous, Mr. Perlman?

ITZHAK PERLMAN

Should I be?

CARLOS

Us kids are gonna be great -- I don't

know about you guys. How much did

you practice?

ROBERTA

You called Vanessa's father and

mother?

JANET

No answer at either.

STAFF PERSON

Half hour call! It's now half hour

call! So pace yourself accordingly.

Don't get more than thirty minutes

worth of nervous!

VANESSA

They stole the car!

MR. KLEIN

With the violin.

ROBERTA

Oh my God.

(calling)

Nick, Lexi --

NICK

Done.

VANESSA

(crying)

And then when we were getting a taxi,

I fell down.

JANET

C'mon honey -- let's get you cleaned

up.

DAN

You're glowing.

ROBERTA

It's terror.

STAFF PERSON

FIVE MINUTE CALL. WE NOW HAVE FIVE

MINUTES.

JANET

When I became the principal of Central

Park East Elementary, I envisioned a

school where children could fulfill

their highest potential, despite the

challenges of poverty and racism.

Ten years ago, Roberta Guaspari walked

into my office because she needed a

job, and because she had a vision

that any child could learn the violin.

We put our dreams together and created

the East Harlem Violin Program which

has helped more than a thousand

students expand their vision of what's

possible in their lives. When a

program like this is cut, our

children's future is compromised. I

want to thank you for your support.

Enjoy the concert.

ROBERTA

Everyone -- attention please!

ROBERTA

I want you all to take a second just

to breathe, O.K.? Deep breath.

ROBERTA

I would like you all to play with

your heart, all right? Play like I

know you can play. You'll be

wonderful. Watch me, don't look out

in the audience -- you don't need to

be afraid. It's gonna be really

wonderful. So play -- play from here.

MALE VOICE (V.O.)

Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Arnold

Steinhardt, Diane Monroe, Michael

Tree, Mark O'Connor and Karen Briggs.

ROBERTA

We're all here tonight because we

have a bigger mission: to take the

magical spirit of tonight's concert

with us out into the world, and to

fight for music and art to be a part

of every child's education. Thank

you.

DISSOLVE TO:

ROBERTA

And this? What's this?

BOY

The frog hair?

ROBERTA

Did you ever see a frog with hair?

A FEW KIDS

It's horsehair!

ROBERTA

That's right.

(to the boy)

But you're right, there is a frog.

Can you show me where it is?

GIRL

Ooh! I know!

ROBERTA

Sssh -- let him answer.

FADE OUT:

THE END
