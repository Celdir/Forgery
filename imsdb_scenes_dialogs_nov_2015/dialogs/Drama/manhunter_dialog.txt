"RED DRAGON"

Screenplay

By

Michael Mann

SECOND DRAFT

July 20, 1984

CRAWFORD

I should have caught you at the boat

yard when you got off work. You

don't want to talk about it here...

GRAHAM

I don't want to talk about it

anywhere.

(beat)

If you brought pictures, leave them

in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin

will be back soon.

CRAWFORD

How much do you know?

GRAHAM

What was in the 'Miami Herald' and

the 'Times.'

(beat)

Confessions?

CRAWFORD

Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He

smashes the mirrors and uses the

pieces.

(beat)

None of them knew that;

GRAHAM

What else did you keep out of the

papers?

CRAWFORD

Blond, right-handed, really strong,

wears a size eleven shoe. The prints

are all smooth gloves. He's on a

full moon cycle. Both times. His

blood is AB Positive.

GRAHAM

Somebody hurt him?

CRAWFORD

Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.

CRAWFORD

Will... you saw this in the papers.

The second one was all over TV. Did

you ever think about givin' me a

call?

GRAHAM

No.

CRAWFORD

Why not?

GRAHAM

The Bureau already has the best lab.

Plus you have Bloom at the University

of Chicago...

CRAWFORD

And I got you down here fixing fuckin'

boat motors.

GRAHAM

You don't need me. I wouldn't

be useful to you anymore, Jack.

CRAWFORD

Last two like this we had, you

caught.

GRAHAM

That was three years ago. And by

doing the same things you and the

rest of them at the lab are doing.

CRAWFORD

That's not entirely true, Will.

It's the way you think.

GRAHAM

I think there has been a lot of

bullshit about the way I think.

(beat)

I came down here to get away from

all that.

CRAWFORD

You look all right now.

GRAHAM

I am all right.

CRAWFORD

If you can't look anymore, I

understand...

GRAHAM

As long as they're dead...

CRAWFORD

These are all dead, Will.

PICTURES

If we expected gory crime photos, these are not them. Two

snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck

carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. A second family

behind a birthday cake at a table. They're all smiling.

CLOSE: GRAHAM

looks at the pictures for a full twenty seconds. Then he

puts them down and looks along the beach.

GRAHAM'S POV: MOLLY + KEVIN

KEVIN -- lanky and tall at eleven -- hunkers down at the

water's edge, 50 yards away examining something in the sand.

MOLLY -- suntanned, blonde and sensuous at thirty stands

watching the two men, her hand on her hip. Waves careen

around her ankles. Her body language openly states

hostility. It's towards Crawford.

GRAHAM (O.S.)

Let's talk after dinner. Stay and

eat.

CRAWFORD (O.S.)

I'LL come back later. I got messages

at the Holiday Inn to collect

Molly starts walking forward. On it...

CUT TO:

INT. GRAHAM'S KITCHEN - MOLLY + GRAHAM - NIGHT

are doing dishes. Graham wipes while Molly washes.

MOLLY

He stopped by to see me at the shop

before he came out here.

GRAHAM

What did he want?

MOLLY

He asked how you are.

GRAHAM

And you said?

MOLLY

I said you are fine, he should leave

you the hell alone.

GRAHAM

I'm a forensic specialist, Molly.

You've seen my diploma?

(sarcastic)

I got a diploma and everything.

MOLLY

You mended a crack in the wallpaper

with your diploma.

(heat)

You are open and easy now... It took

you a lot of work to get to that...

GRAHAM

We have it good, don't we?

MOLLY

All the things that happened to you

before make you know that...

There is a soft pleading in her voice.

GRAHAM

What the hell can I do?

MOLLY

(after a pause)

What you've already decided. You're

not really asking.

GRAHAM

If I were?

MOLLY

(facing him)

Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.

And Kevin.

(heat)

That's selfish, huh?

GRAHAM

(touches the side

of her face)

I don't care.

(beat>

He'll never see me or know my name.

If we find him, the police will have

to take him down. Not me, I'm just

looking at evidence.

CUT TO:

KEVIN

Will it keep them out?

GRAHAM

Yeah. ..

KEVIN

How many turtle eggs you think are

in here?

GRAHAM

In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.

KEVIN

Crabs would get most of the newborns

before they made it to the sea, huh?

GRAHAM

Yeah, but not now.. These will all

make it... guaranteed.

CUT TO:

MOLLY

Whatever I say, you'll take him

away, won't you?

CRAWFORD

I have to.

MOLLY

You're his friend, Jack. Why can't

you leave him alone?

CRAWFORD

Because it's his bad luck to be

special.

MOLLY

He thinks you want him to look at

evidence.

CRAWFORD

Nobody's better with evidence. But

he has the other thing, too. He

doesn't like that part of it...

MOLLY

You wouldn't like it, either if you

had it.

CRAWFORD

Talking about 'like,' you don't like

me very much, do you?

MOLLY

No.

(beat)

I don't like people who park in the

'handicapped zone'...

CRAWFROD

I'LL try to keep him as far away from

it as I can...

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

(distant)

Thanks for the lift.

OFFICER

I'll come inside with you, if you

like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd

probably want to be alone.

GRAHAM

That's right.

OFFTCER

There's a VTR setup waiting in your

hotel room, that you asked for

They transferred the home movies of

both families once half-inch VHS.

GRAHAM

(getting out)

Thanks.

Graham exits the car and walks TOWARDS us. We PAN AROUND as

he moves through EXTREME CLOSEUP and see the Leeds family house

with all of the Atlanta Police department "crime scene" postings

Graham doesn't enter the front door. Be walks around the side.

CUT TO:

INT. LEEDS HOUSE, KITCHEN - WIDE - NIGHT

Three big sliding glass doors. The center one has been re-

placed with plywood. It's dark. A flashlight's beam starts

playing through the bushes in the side yard.., then the light

appears and blasts IN the LENS. It lights lots of dishes in

the sink. The dark kitchen looks like anybody's kitchen. The

house feels occupied. The Leed's possessions have been

undisturbed.

CLOSE: GLASS DOOR

We hear the lock click and the door slide open as Graham

enters. It's like he's a burglar.

GRAHAM'S FEET

walk through the kitchen as if he knows where he is going.

A thermostat clicks and air conditioning comes on loudly.

Graham's feet pass our of frame...

INT. LEEDS HOUSE, SECOND STORY - FLOOR

is empty. The carpet is dark. We hear Graham's footsteps

up the stairs. Then his feet enter the frame and a flash-

light beam hits the carpet. It dwells on a couple of dark

stains. Track with Graham's feet to the entry to the master

bedroom. The bedroom is dark. We see nothing.

INT. LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM - LIGHT SWITCH

Graham's hand enters. He hits the light switch.

BLOOD

screams at us from the walls.

CLOSE: GRAHAM

doesn't visibly react.

GRAHAM

intruder entered through kitchen

sliding door. Probably a glass

cutter. Why didn't he care that he

left AB saliva on the glass? it was

hot out that night. inside, the

house must' have been pleasantly cool

to him.

(beat)

The intruder cut Charles Leeds'

throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs.

Leeds. He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was

rising... Bullet entered the right of

her navel and lodged in her lumbar

spine, but she died of strangulation...

increase of serotonin and free

histimine levels in the gunshot wound

indicates... she lived at least five

minutes after she was shot... All

her other injuries were post-mortem.

(beat>

Then he went toward the children's

room.

(beat)

Direction and velocity of blood

stains on the east wall indicate

arterial spray.;. With his throat

cut, Mr. Leeds still tried to fight.

Because the intruder was moving to

the children's room...

(beat)

in the children's room the intruder

shot the first boy in bed. Second

boy was found in bed, but dustballs

indicate he was dragged out from

under his bed to be shot...

(MORE)

GRAHAM (CONT'D)

(beat)

Profusion of bloodstains and matted

sliding marks on hall carpet and

west wall of master bedroom remain

unexplained... as does superficial

ligature mark around Mr. Leed's

chest, believed to be post-mortem.

What did the killer do with them

after they were dead? And before

he put the boys back in their beds?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

There's a wicker dog bed on the back

porch. There's a doghouse in the

back yard. Where's the dog?

CUT TO:

CONVENTIONEER #1

...like to rip me off a piece of

that!

CONVENTIONEER #2

Fuck her 'til her nose bleeds.

CONVENTIONEER #1

What the fuck are you lookin' at?

CONVENTIONEER #l

(being pulled out

of elevator)

What are you, a faggot?

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

(into the tape

recorder)

When they were dead -- except

possibly Mrs. Leeds -- he smashed

the mirrors and began selecting

shards that he used later on Mrs.

Leeds... What did he do in the

interval? Struggling with Mr.

Leeds and killing the others would

take less than a minute. What

else?

(beat)

Three bloodstains on the east wall,

not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray.

What did killer do after they were

dead?

GRAHAM

(into phone)

Molly?

MOLLY (V.O.)

(asleep)

Huh?

(beat)

Will? Is that you?

GRAHAM

It's me. I'll call you tomorrow,

sweetheart. Go back to sleep.

(beat)

I love you...

MOLLY (V.O.)

Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will.

Good night.

GRAHAM

(into tape recorder)

You moved the kids after you killed

them, didn't you? Did you arrange

them for your performance with Mrs.

Leeds on their bed? Did you tie Mr.

Leeds sitting up in bed? That's the

postmortem ligature on his chest.

Did you make them your audience?

Did you open their eyes? There is

something you can't afford for me

to know about. Isn't there? Mrs.

Leeds was lovely, wasn't she? It was

maddening to have to wear gloves when

you touched her, wasn't it?

(beat)

There was talcum powder on her leg.

There was no talcum powder in the

bathroom.

(beat)

The powder they found came out of a

rubber glove as you pulled it off

to touch her. You took off your

glove to touch her. DIDN'T YOU,

YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH?! You touched

her with your bare hands! And then

you put the gloves back an. And

you wiped her down! While your

gloves were off?

(shouts)

DID YOU OPEN THEIR EYES? THEIR DEAD

EYES?!

GRAHAM

Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still

in Latent Prints?

CRAWFORD (V.O.)

He's working on the single print

index. What time is it?

Get him to Atlanta.

CRAWFORD (V.O.)

You said the guy down here is good.

GRAHAM

He is good. Bur not as good as Price.

CRAWFORD (V.O.)

What do you want to do?

GRAHAM

Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails.

I think he took off his gloves, Jack.

(heat)

And dust all the corneas of all their

eyes.

CUT TO:

SPRINGFIELD

Our people swear he wore surgeons'

gloves the whole time. They dusted

everything.

GRAHAM

The report didn't mention nails and

eyes.

SPRINGFIELD

Why do you think he took his gloves

off?

GRAHAM

Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman.

I'd want to touch her skin in an

intimate situation, wouldn't you?

SPRINGFIELD

(sudden distaste)

'Intimate? !"

GRAHAM

Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.

(beat)

Everybody else was dead.

SPRINGFIELD

All right. House to house interviews

will be extended four additional

blocks. R & I has loaned us two

clerks to help cross-matching airline

reservations between Birmingham last

month and between Atlanta now.

(beat)

Dr. Princi.

DR. PRINCI

This is what the subject's teeth

look like. The Smithsonian in

Washington reconstructed them from

the impressions we took of bite

marks off the Leeds woman here and

off the Jacobi woman last month in

Birmingham.

(beat)

As you can see, he has pegged lateral

incisors -- the teeth here and here.

SPRINGFIELD

Investigator Graham has worked this

kind of thing before. Can you add

anything?

SPRINGFIELD

Can't hear you. Can you come up to

the front?

GRAHAM

He may have a history of biting --

barroom fights or child abuse.

SPRINGFIELD

He only bit women so far, right?

GRAHAM

That's all we know about.

(MORE)

GRAHAM (CONT'D)

(beat)

Most of the time in sex assaults the

bite mark has a livid spot in the

center. A suck mark. These don't.

So, for him, biting may be a fighting

pattern as much as sexual behavior.

(beat)

You could try emergency room

personnel, treatment for bite wounds.

I know that's pretty thin...

(beat)

He bites a lot.

SPRINGFIELD

What's average?

GRAHAM

Sex murder: three. He likes to

bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.

Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...

(beat)

... that's all I have.

SPRINGFIELD

All right. Vice and Narcotics, take

the K-Y cowboys and the leather bars.

Marcus and Whitman heads up at the

funeral. The rest of you, your

assignments are on the sheet. Let's

go.

SPRINGFIELD

One more thing: I've heard officers

referring to the killer as the 'Tooth

Fairy.

(on laughter)

Yeah, yeah, but I don't want to hear

that in public or internal memoranda.

That's it.

SPRINGFIELD

(to Crawford)

We don't have shit, and we know it.

SPRINGFIELD

(to Graham)

The Commissioner was saying you

were the one that caught Dr. Lecter

three years ago.

(beat)

He killed nine people, didn't he?

GRAHAM

Nine that we know of. Two didn't

die.

SPRINGFIELD

What happened to them?

GRAHAM

One's on the respirator at a hospital

in Baltimore. The other is in a

private mental hospital in Denver.

SPRINGFIELD

What did the psychologists say was

wrong with Lecter?

GRAHAM

Psychologists call him a sociopath.

They don't know what else to call

him.

SPRINGFIELD

What would you call him?

SPRINGFIELD

To yourself...

GRAHAM

I call him a monster.

SPRINGFIELD

I understand he cut you pretty good...

GRAHAM

(cold right turn>

What about the dog?

SPRINGFIELD

It's at the vet's. The kids brought

it in with a puncture wound in the

abdomen. icepick or an awl.

GRAHAM

Was the dog wearing a collar with

the Leeds' name on it?

SPRINGFIELD

No.

GRAHAM

Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have

a dog?

CRAWFORD

(alert)

A cat. We found a litter box

downstairs but not the cat.

Neighbors are watching for it.

GRAHAM

Why don't you get Birmingham P.D.

a methane probe out of D.C. and

have them cover the backyard...

maybe the cat's dead and the kids

buried it.

SPRINGFIELD

Yeah?

(waits)

JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)

Who am I talking to?

CRAWIIORD

Jimmie, it's me, Jack Crawford, and

you got Will Graham here.

JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)

I got a partial with a tented arch

that's probably a thumb print and

a fragment of a palm.

JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)

Came off the oldest kid's left eye.

It stood out against an eight-ball

hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.

CRAWFORD

Can you make an identification off

it?

JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)

Don't know. The palm came off the

nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.

I want to work these up in my own

darkroom. I'll fax the prints down

to you this afternoon.

CUT TO:

LOUNDS

Will Graham! Remember me? Freddie

Lounds? I covered the Lecter

case for the Tattler. I did the

paperback... !

LOUNDS

(running on, behind

them)

When did they call you in, Will?

What have you got?

CRAWFORD

Lounds, give it a rest...

LOUNDS

Come on, Graham?! Talk to me!

LOUNDS

How does this guy compare with

Lecter? How does he do them?

GRAHAM

Grabs Lounds by the labels, kicks his legs out from under

him and throws him over the hood of a car upside-down. The

impact STARS the WINDSHIELD Lounds is scared to death. The

violence totally surprises us. Graham's face is inches from

Lounds.

GRAHAM

(very low)

Keep the fuck away from me!

Crawford is pulling on Graham. He can't budge him. Graham

lets go.

WIDER: CRAWFORD PULLING GRAHAM AWAY

down the sidewalk and Lounds who slides off the car hood and

lands on all fours.

CRAWFORD

(over his shoulder

to Lounds)

Get the hell away from here, Lounds!

CUT TO:

INT. DINER, BOOTH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY

Graham is staring into the black deep recesses of his coffee.

Crawford is looking at him. Finally:

GRAHAM

...snuck in the hospital while I

was sedated, flipped back the sheets

and shot pictures. The only decent

thing he did was run a black square

over my balls...

CRAWFORD

I know...

Graham looks away. Then he lights another cigarette.

GRAHAM

(back to business)

Atlanta and Birmingham can run

the thumb print against known sex

offenders. Five will get you

ten they don't come up with an

identification. Jimmie may in the

Finder program... if he's ever been

printed and in his Index.

CRAWFORD

GRAHAM

CRAWFORD

GRAHAM.

(pause)

CRAWFORD

GRAHAM

(beat)

CRAWFORD

(beat)

GRAHAM

CRAWFORD

GRAHAM

(MORE)

GRAHAM (CONT'D)

(beat)

The Tooth Fairy will go on until we

get smart or get lucky. He won't

stop.

CRAWFORD

Why?

GRAHAM

Because he has a genuine taste for

it, Jack.

CRAWFORD

See? You do know something about

him.

GRAHAM

(long stare at

Crawford; then)

... I'm going to see Lecter.

CRAWFORD

For Christ's sake, why?

GRAHAM

(matter-of-fact)

To recover the mind set.

CUT TO:

MOLLY (V.O.)

Hello, hotshot!

GRAHAM

Hey, baby! Where are you?

MOLLY (V.O.)

At the store. You doin' some good?

GRAHAM

None you'd notice. I'm lonely...

MOLLY (V,O.)

Me, too. And very erotic...

GRAHAM

Tell me about yourself.

MOLLY (V.O.)

Which part? That or the day-to-day.

GRAHAM

(laughs)

Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.

(beat)

How's Kevin?

MOLLY (V.O.)

Kevin's fine. He had to recover the

turtle eggs you two fenced in. The

dogs dug them up. Tell me what

you're doing.

GRAHAM

Eating junk food.

(beat)

They don't have a lock on anything,

Molly. There's not enough

information. Or I haven't done

enough with it...

MOLLY (V.O.)

Will you be in Atlanta for a while?

I'm not buggin' you about coming

home, I just wondered.

GRAHAM

Z don't know. I'm goin' up to

Baltimore this afternoon.

MOLLY (V.O.)

To do what?

GRAHAM

I have to see somebody.

MOLLY (V.O.)

I'm thinking about painting the

kitchen. What color do you like,

Will? Are you there?

GRAHAM

(coming back)

Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it

yellow.

MOLLY (V.O.)

Yellow's a bad color for me. I'LL

look green at breakfast.

GRAHAM

Blue, then.

MOLLY (V.O.)

Blue is cold.

GRAHAM

Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-

brown for all I care...

(beat)

Look, I'm sorry. When I come home,

we'll go to the paint store together

and get some chips and...

MOLLY (V.O.)

Will, I don't know why I'm talking

about this stuff...

(beat)

I called to tell you: I love you

and I miss you. And you are doing

the right thing. It's costing

you, too. And I know that. And

I'm here. I'LL be here whenever

you come home. Or I'LL meet you

anywhere.  Anytime. That's what I

called to say...

GRAHAM

Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now,

baby. ..

MOLLY (V.O.)

GRAHAM

I love you...

CUT TO:

DR. CHILTON

Dr. Bloom called me yesterday, Mr.

Graham. Or should I call you Dr.

Graham?

GRAHAM (O.S.)

I'm not a doctor.

(beat)

I need to see Lecter in as much

privacy as possible.

TWO SHOT

Graham sits in front of his desk in a chair. He appears

repressed, clamped down. Dr. Chilton is a sincere Chief of

Staff, but not gifted.

DR. CHILTON

Dr. Lecter will stay in his room.

That is absolutely the only place

where he is not put in full body

restraints. One wall of his room

is a double barrier. I will have

a chair put just outside.

GRAHAM

I might have to show him some

material that could stimulate him.

DR. CHILTON

As long as it's on soft paper.

You may(Pause) find this curious.

He pulls an EKG tape from a drawer and points to the

spiky lines.

DR. CHILTON

Here Lecter's resting on the

examining table getting an

electrocardiogram. Complained of

chest pains. Pulse seventy-two.

Here he grabs the nurse's head and

pulls her down to him. Here he's

subdued by the attendant and

Lecter's shoulder is dislocated.

Do you notice the strange thing?

(pause)

His pulse never got over eighty-

five. Even when he tore into her

face.

Dr. Chilton looks over at Graham, perhaps expecting a.

response. There is nothing to read in Graham's face. It is

a blank.

DR. CHILTON

The consensus around here is that

the only person who has demonstrated

any practical understanding of Dr.

Hannibal Lecter is you, Mr. Graham.

Can you tell me anything about him?

GRAHAM

No.

DR. CHILTON

When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders,

their 'style,' so to speak, were you

able to reconstruct his fantasies?

And did that help you identify him?

GRAHAM

(stands)

I want to see Lecktor now.

DR. CHILTON

Uh... sure...

LECKTOR

That's the same atrocious aftershave

you wore in court three years ago.

GRAHAM

I keep getting it for Christmas.

LECKTOR

Did you get my card?

GRAHAM

I got it. Thank you.

LECKTOR

And how is Officer Stuart? The one

who was the first to see my basement.

GRAHAM

Stuart is fine.

LECKTOR

Emotional problems, I hear. He was

a very promising young officer. Do

you ever have any problems, Will?

GRAHAM

No.

LECKTOR

Of course, you don't.

(pause)

I'm glad you came. My callers are

all professional. Clinical

psychiatrists from cornfield colleges

somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.

GRAHAM

Dr. Bloom showed me your article on

surgical addiction in the journal

of Clinical Psychiatry.

LECKTOR

And?

GRAHAM

Very interesting, even to a layman.

LECKTOR

A layman.., layman. Interesting

term. So many experts on government

grants. And you say you're a

'layman?' But it was you who caught

me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know

how you did it'

GRAHAM

You've read the transcript. It's

all there.

LECKTOR

No it's not. Do you know how you

Did it Will?

GRAHAM

LECKTOR

(smiles)

GRAHAM

LECKTOR

GRAHAM

LECKTOR

GRAHAM

LECKTOR

(laughs)

GRAHAM

LECKTOR

GRAHAM

LECKTOR

(laugh;)

(beat)

GRAHAM

You'll get to see the file on this

case. And there's another reason.

LECKTOR

Pray tell.

GRAHAM

I thought you might be curious to

find our if you're smarter than

the person I'm looking for.

LECKTOR

Then by implication, you think that

you are smarter than me, since you

caught me.

GRAHAM

No. I knew that I'm nor smarter

than you are.

LECKTOR

Then how did you catch me, Will?

GRAHAM

You had disadvantages.

LECKTOR

What disadvantage?.

GRAHAM

You're insane.

LECKTOR

You're very tan, Will.

LECKTOR

Your hands are rough. They don't

look like a cop s hands anymore.

That shaving lotion is something a

child would select. It has a ship

on the bottle, doesn't it?

LECKTOR

Don't think you can persuade me with

appeals to my intellectual vanity.

GRAHAM

I don't think I'll persuade you.

You'll do it or you won't. Dr.

Bloom is working an it anyway, and

he's the best...

LECKTOR

(interrupts)

Do you have the file with you

GRAHAM

Yes.

LECKTOR

Pictures?

GRAHAM

Yes.

LECKTOR

let me have them,, and I might

consider it.

GRAHAM

No.

LECKTOR

Do you dream much, Will?

GRAHAM

Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.

LECKTOR

You haven't threatened to take away

my books yet.

LECKTOR

let me have the file. Then I'll

tell you what I think.

LECKTOR (O.S.)

There is a very shy boy, Will.

LECKTOR

What were the yards like?

GRAHAM

Big backyards, fences, some hedges,

why?

LECKTOR

Because, my dear Will, if this

Pilgrim imagines he has a

relationship with the full moon,

he might go outside and look at it.

Have you seen blood in moonlight,

Will? It appears quite black. If

one were nude, it would be better

to have outdoor privacy for this

sort of thing.

GRAHAM

That's interesting.

LECKTOR

It's not 'interesting'. You thought

of it before.

GRAHAM

Yes. I'd considered it.

LECKTOR

You came here to look at me, Will.

To get the old scent again, didn't

you?

GRAHAM

I want your opinion.

LECKTOR

I don't have one right now.

GRAHAM

When you do have one I'd like to

hear it.

LECKTOR

May I keep the file?

GRAHAM

I haven't decided yet.

LECKTOR

I'll study it, Will. When you get

more files, I'd like to see them,

too. You can call me. When I

have to call my lawyer, they bring

me a telephone. Would you like to

give me your home number?

GRAHAM

No.

LECKTOR

Do you know how you caught me,

Will?

GRAHAM

Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can

leave messages for me at the number

on the file.

LECKTOR

Do you know how you caught me?

LECKTOR (O.S.)

The reason you caught me, Will, is:

we're just alike. You want the

scent? Smell yourself.

EILEEN

Mr. Dollarhyde?

DOLLARHYDE

Yes, Eileen.

EILEEN

Bill told me to tell you there was

a variation in the gamma of the

number three developer. But he

caught it.

DOLLARHYDE

And?

EILEEN

On the densitometer it came out

within tolerances.

DOLLARHYDE

Thank you, Eileen.

EXTREMELY CLOSE: SECOND IMAGE OF WILL GRAHAM

Dollarhyde's massive finger slides across the image, brush-

Linda doesn't come in nights.

LECKTOR

Maybe you can help me. This is

someone. Linda never sent me the

GRADUATE STUDENT (V.O.)

She'll be in, in the morning...

LECKTOR

I have to catch Federal Express

immensely appreciative if you'd

pull it out of her Rolodex for me.

GRADUATE STUDENT (V.O.)

She doesn't have a Rolodex.

Yeah. ..

I get a lot of calls. Most of them

GRAHAM

Talk to them a few minutes and

you can tell they don't have the

capacity to even understand what's

going on. Do you?

He's very strong physically.

VOICE (O.S.)

That's true.

He's white and six feet tall. You

VOICE (O.S.)

Describe exactly what you think he

did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you

DR. CHILTON

Yeah. It's right here.

Right away!

SARAH

I'm sorry. Special Agent Crawford

Can I get them to call you back?

DR. CHILTON (V.O.)

This is Dr. Chilton. At the

Chesapeake Hospital. Will you

What is it?

SARAH

It's a Dr. Chilton, sir. He says

it's urgent.

GRARAM

It's Will Graham...

DR. CHILTON (V.O.)

Well, it's about goddamn time! I

have a note here, or two pieces of

a note, that appears to be from the

man who killed those people in

Atlanta and....

GRAHAM

Where did you get it?!

DR. CHILTON (V.O.)

From Hannibal Lecktor's cell. It

was hidden in a book.

CRAWFORD

(to Lounds)

Run along to the police station,

Freddie. We'll talk to you when

we get around to it...

CUT TO:

GRAHAM (V.O.)

Can you read it to me?

DR. CHILTON

It's written on toilet tissue.

'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell

you I'm delighted that you've taken an

interest in me. I know that you alone

can understand what I'm becoming.

(reads )

'I know you alone understand the

reality of the people who die to

help me in these things,

understand that they are only

elements undergoing change to fuel

the radiance of what I am becoming.

Just as the source of light is

burning.

(beat)

Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn

and punched our, then it says...

(reads)

'I have a complete collection of

your press notices. f think of

them as unfair. As unfair as

mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What

could be more inappropriate.

Investigator Graham interests me.

Very purposeful locking. I hope

we can correspond.

(beat)

There's another piece missing here.

I'LL read the bottom part.

(reads )

'After I hear back from you, I

might send you something wet.

Signed: Avid Fan.

(to Graham)

It has teethmarks pressed in it at

the bottom.

CBAWFORD

Sarah, order a chopper. I want the

next thing smoking and I don't care

whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines.

Then call Documents. Tell them to

scramble a team. I want everybody

moving in five minutes.

(punches into Dr.

Chilton's line)

Dr. Chilton, please do not handle

the note. I have a Documents team

on the way to you by helicopter to

pick it up.

GRAHAM

After we've worked the note we

want to replace it in Lecktor's

cell. I don't want him to know

we found it.

(beat)

Where's Lector now?

DR. CHILTON (V.O.)

In a holding cell.

GRAHAM

How long can you keep Lecktor out

without him getting suspicious?

DR. CHILTON (V.O.)

Three, four hours.

CRAWFORD

Have your building superintendent

shut off the water and most of the

lighting in Lecktor's hall. Have

him walk through carrying tools

and being pissed off or something,

DR. CHILTDN (V.O.)

Yes. We can manage all that.

CRAWFORD

(hits another line)

Brian. We have a note coming in on

the fly. Possibly from the Tooth

Fairy. Number one priority.,

It has to go to Hair and Fiber,

Latent Prints and Documents.

Graham and I will be walking it

through...

CUT TO:

BEVERLY KATZ

One hair, Graham. Maybe a thirty-

second of an inch. A couple of

blue grains. I'll work it up.

What else have you got?

GRAHAM

Hair from Lecktor's comb. Whiskers

from an electric razor they let

him use. This is hair from the

cleaning man.

CUT TO:

PRICE (O.S.)

Perspiration stains, nothing else.

(beat)

How many guys handled this without

gloves ?

GBAHAM (O.S.)

The cleanup man and Lecktor...

PRICE (O.S.)

The cleanup man scrubbing sinks

probably had the oil washed off

his fingers. But the others...

(beat)

I could fume it, Will, but couldn't

guarantee the iodine stains would

fade our in the time you've got to

get it back.

GRAHAM (O.S.)

Ninhydran? Boosted with heat?

PRICE (O.S.)

No. We couldn't wash it after. I

can't get a print off this, Will.

There isn't one.

CRAWPDRD (O.S.)

Dammit.

CUT TO:

BOWMAN

(without looking up)

How long do I have?

CRAWFORD

Twenty minutes max.

GRAHAM

The main thing is: how was Lecktor

to reply.

BOWMAN

That's probably in the part Lecktor

tore out.

(beat)

At the top it says: 'I hope we can

correspond.' And then the hole

begins .

(beat)

It looks like Lecktor went over it

with a felt tip pen and then folded

it and pinched most of it away.

GRAHAM (O.S.)

He doesn't have anything to cut with.

BOWMAN (O.S.)

Now we can mash it a little.

BOWMAN

(chants under

his breath)

You're so sly, but so am I...

BOWMAN (O.S.)

Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip

pens -- which is what Lecktor has

-- are transparent to infrared. The

Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...

CRAWFORD (O.S.)

That could be the tip of a 't.

Here and here. And here.

BOWMAN (O.S.)

At the end is the tail of what

could be an 'r.

GRAHAM

We know the Tooth Fairy reads the

Tattler. The stuff about me and

Lector? I don't know any other

paper that carried it...

CRAWFORD

It's being Telexed to you right now.

GRAHAM

CHESTER (V.O.)

'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'

And your message has to go out in it,

to him.

CRAWFORD

Book code?

BOWMAN

'One hundred prayers' could be the

page number. The paired numbers

and the scriptural references could

be line and letter. But what book?

CBAWFORD

Not the Bible?

BOWMAN

No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians

has only six chapters. The same

with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four

chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a

Bible.

GRAHAM

Then the Tooth Fairy named the

book in the part Lecktor tore out.

BOWMAN

Right .

(beat)

What about sweating Lecktor?

GRAHAM

They tried sodium amytal on him

three years ago to find where he

buried a Princeton student.

(beat)

He gave them a recipe for potato

chip dip.

BOWMAN

it has to be a book the Tooth Fairy

would know Lecktor has in his cell.

GRAHAM

He'd know it from articles he's

read about Lecktor...

CRAWFORD

cell, took Polaroids so they could

get everything back in place...

BOWMAN

BOWMAN

Library of Congress.

GRAHAM

Twenty-five minutes. We won't

make it in time.

CRAWFORD

(looks at watch)

We let Lecktor's message run as is

and decode it after. Or we pull

it, work our the code and put ours

in next week.

GRAHAM

Can we still get Lecktor's message

out of the paper?

CRAWFORD

Yes. And I'm leery of running

Lecktor's message without knowing

what it says.

GRAHAM

And if we pull it, we lose a week...

We only have two to the next full

moon .

CRAWFORD

It's your call, Will. What do we

I found a curly piece of metal in

The kind of shred a pipe threader

steam fitters, plumbers. It took

a long time. In one place there

was a resignation letter from a

man named Hobbs. I saw it and it

was.., peculiar.

I was going up these stairs to

Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway

up when he shoved his wife down

at me. She was dying.

I sent the officer with me to call

a SWAT team. But I could hear kids

in there and screaming. I couldn't

wait .

KEVIN

You went in the apartment?

GRAHAM

Yes. Hobbs had one of his

daughters from behind. He was

cutting her. I shot him.

GRAHAM

I kept thinking there must be some

way I could have handled it better.

It kept replaying in my mind.

Later I got depressed. A doctor

friend of mine, Dr. Bloom, asked

me to go into a hospital. After a

while I got some distance on it

and was okay.

KEVIN

Did the girl die?

No.

I'll tell you the events. The

Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven-

year-old daughter's throat. Graham

shot him with his .38 six times.

Hobbs still didn't go down. He had

to wade in...

CRAWFORD

That's when it happened?

BLOOM

No. It happened when Graham went

to see Hobbs' daughter four months

later in the hospital. She saved

her carotid artery.., but lost

three fingers and her larynx. She

was connected up to a voice box.

When Graham went to see her, she

asked him -- through the speaker:

'Why did you have to kill my

daddy? '

(beat)

That's when Graham had his nervous

breakdown.

CRAWFORD

What's the bottom line?

BLOOM

If he pushes too deep into our boy's

mind-set, he may destroy himself.

What are you planning, Jack?

CRAWFORD

Could he handle a direct contact?

BLOOM

I don't recommend it.

GRAHAM (O.S.)

You don't recommend what, Sidney?

BLOOM

Crawford has a proposition. I

don't think it's a good idea.

GRAHAM

If the Tooth Fairy listens to

Lecktor, he'll come for me. So

we're going to set me up as bait

to draw him out. Give him a

clean shot.

CUT TO:

GRAHAM

I believe he's socially

maladjusted. Laughed at by his

contemporaries...

LOUNDS

How does he rate compared to Dr,

Hannibal Lecktor?

GRAHAM

He's not as intelligent.

GRAHAM

(to Bloom)

What have we missed?

BLOOM

He may have an unconscious

homosexual conflict. A fear of

being gay. He objects to the word

'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains

indicate that he put the shorts on

Charles Leeds after he was dead.

I believe he did this to emphasize

his lack of interest in Mr, Leeds.

GRAHAM

The killer has sexually molested

all his male victims. He is a

homosexual and impotent with

persons of the opposite sex.

(beat)

Our forensic psychologists have

projected he may have been the

product of an incestuous home

life .

(added afterthought)

And probably had sexual relations

with his mother...

LOUNDS

How long will you stay in

Washington?

GBAHAM

Until we've taken out the Tooth

Fairy.

GRAHAM

All right. Let's shoot the

pictures .

LOUNDS

(to Crawford)

I want shots with me and Graham

together .

LOUNDS

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. You want

this to look real, don't you?

GRAHAM

Keep the motel sign across the

street just slightly out of focus.

He has to be able to read it, but

it can't look too obvious.

CRAWFORD

(low)

Asian studies at Langley said the

mark you found on the tree is a

Chinese character considered a

thinks he's becoming.

The answer is something to do with

how he uses the mirrors. That's

what's missing for me. why the

mirrors?

The usual motivation doesn't apply

to him, nor the way he uses them.

I don't have an answer for you.

You worked out well.

REBA

You know you speak very well,

although you avoid fricatives and

sibilants in your speech. At the

Riker Institute for the Blind. I

REBA

I'll probably go back to it someday.

DOLLARHYDE

Uh-huh.

REBA.

If you don't want to talk. okay.

Bur I hope you will... because I

like what you say.

REBA

May I touch your face?

I arranged for him to have a phone.

I have to call him in a few minutes.

CRAWFORD (V.O.)

From the lip wound, which happened

seven hours before he got burned,

we've narrowed it down to those

cities within the seven-hour driving

radius that also would've caught

the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.

GRAHAM

What's it narrow down to?

CRAWFORD(V.O.)

Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria,

Sr. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati,

Toledo and Detroit.

GRAHAM

(laughs )

That's narrow?

CRAWFORD (V.O.)

When are you coming back?

GRAHAM

When I'm done.

GRAHAM

It's Will Graham. Is Molly there,

Mr. Swenson?

GRAMPA (V.0.)

Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?!

You sure are in the center of a

storm. Burning up lots of

taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.

On the news they said he was a white

man. He isn't really, is he?

GRAHAM

Sure he is. Blond.

Probably Scandinavian, too...

GRAMPA (V.O.)

You going back down to Florida after?

GRAHAM

Yes. Is Molly there?

GRAMPA (V.O.)

My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of

breakfast every day. Been out

riding. Must be the good air. You

oughta see that little booger eat.

I'11 bet he's gained ten pounds.

Molly's out in the motor home...

I know... 'Out in the good air...'

GRAMPA (V.O.)

What's that?

GRAHAM

Tell her I called.

GPAHAM

This is Will Graham. Dr. Chilton

arranged for me to talk with Dr.

Lecktor .

OPERATOR (V.O.)

I'll put you through.

LECXTOR

I wanted to congratulate you for the

job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired

it enormously. What a cunning boy

you are. Will.

GRAHAM

What do you want?

LECKTOR

You know Lounds's enlightened me on

one thing: your confinement in the

mental hospital. My attorney should

have brought that our in court.

GRAHAM

I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of-

bitches. If you've got something to

say, Lecktor, say it.

LECKTOR

I want to help you, Will. You'd be

more comfortable if you relaxed with

yourself. We don't invent our

natures, They're issued to us.

Along with our lungs and pancreas

and everything else. Why fight it?

GRAHAM

Fight what?

LECKTOR

When you were so depressed after

you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to

death, it wasn't the act that got

you down. Didn't you really feel

so bad because killing him felt so

good?

(ironic)

And why shouldn't it feel good?! It

must feel good to God. God does it

all the time!

GRAHAM

I don't believe in God.

LECKTOR

You should, Will. God's terrific!

(beat)

He dropped a church roof on thirty-

four of His worshippers in Texas last

Wednesday night. Just as they were

grovelling to Him and singing a hymn.

Don't you think that felt good?

(beat)

He wouldn't begrudge you two measly

murders.

GRAHAM

Why does it feel good?

LECKTOR

It feels good because: if you do as

God does, enough times, you become

as God is: powerful...

LECKTOR

(fading)

God's a champ! He got a hundred and

sixty Philippines in one plane crash

two months ago... Remember the big

earthquake in Italy last spring...?

I am soundless. I move to the door.

I step into the room...

CRAHAM

I see you there. I breathe in the

perfume of this room. I am in the

inner sanctum of a life. You will

accept me. Take me into you.

GRAHAM (O.S.)

You will be better than anything...

anything I have ever known. As I

see me in your eyes.., as I see me

accepted there. Reflected there in

mirrors .

And you, you are the fuel for my

No. Francis is gone. Francis is

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD (O.S.)

What's important?

GRAHAM

He changes them into beings that

accept him... And he needs to see

the acceptance, In the mirrors.

I didn't understand the mirrors

before.

(beat)

It's very important.

CRAWFORD

'Changes?'

GRAHAM

It's a word. Killing them...

(beat)

His delusion is: if he sees

himself accepted enough times, he

will become as one who has the

power to be accepted all the time.

(beat)

And he would record it somehow. So

he can see himself received over

and over again...

CRAWFORD

VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?

GRAHAM

How do I know?!

GRAHAM

He's very careful, very... designed

when he chooses,

(beat )

If we find out how he finds them,

then we'll find him.

CRAWFORD

There's no connection between the

families.

GRAHAM

There has to be.

CRAWFORD

(exasperated)

There is none! We've run it

through the computer a dozen

times .

GRAHAM

(suddenly calm)

He's a very shy boy...

CRAWFORD

What?

GRAHAM

Something Lecktor said.

CRAWFORD

Let's admit we struck out this

month. The Gulf Stream's standing

by. The basic lab stuff is on it.

You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a

photographer. Anywhere he hits,

we can be there in an hour and

fifteen minutes. We get the call,

we roll. The scene'll be very

fresh. ..

GRAHAM

It's not over yet.

CRAWFORD

It's a foregone conclusion. For

Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.

The full moon is tonight.

CRAWFORD

Will?

GRAHAM

(explodes )

You wanna watch this or what?!

GRAHAM

That's why the boltcutter.

CRAWFORD

What's that?

GRAHAM

He used a boltcutter to trim the

branch out of his way. When he

was watching from the woods. Why

didn't he use it to go through the

basement door?

CRAWFORD

Because a steel door and deadbolt

were there when they were killed.

GRAHAM

You mean Jacobi put it in between

when this film was made and when

he was murdered?

CRAWFORD

He had to.

GRAHAM

Donald Jacobi's eleventh birthday

party was April fourteenth.

Sometime between April fourteenth

and May third they changed the

door.

(beat)

But you can't see either family's

door from the street. He wouldn't

know until he got to the house that

the padlock wasn't there anymore...

GRAHAM

(intently on the screen )

From the alley he couldn't have

seen the glass in the Leeds' kitchen

door .

(MORE)

GRAHAM (CONT'D)

There's a lattice porch back there,

but he was ready with his glasscutter.

(beat)

So he was either casing far ahead and

we didn't check back far enough or...

CRAWFORD

It's getting late and...

GRAHAM

(explodes)

Don't talk to me!!

GRAHAM

It's Graham. The Jacobi stuff is

still in the storeroom?

METCALPE (V.O.)

Yeah. You know what time it is?

GRAHAM

Have one of the guards down there

call me.

METCALFE (V.O.)

If the guy's not asleep...

GRAHAM

Do it.

GRAHAM

(to himself)

You knew that was the Jacobis'

cat ...

GRAHAM

(to himself)

You brought a boltcutter... 'cause

you thought there was a padlock...

GRAHAM

(to himself)

And the Leeds' dog doesn't have a

collar... But you know it's the

Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?!

GRAHAM

(to himself)

See the woman?

GRAHAM

The bloom on the woman. You can

almost feel her.  You can see her

again and again. Anytime you want.
