MARTIN

Sir. Sir, may I have a ticket to

Montreal please?

CASHIER

Pardon?

MARTIN

I need a ticket to Montreal.

CASHIER

Montreal?

MARTIN

Yes, sir.     Please.

CASHIER

Forty-three dollars.

DAN

Dan Soulsby.

MARTIN

Martin.     Nice to meet you.

DAN

Where you heading to?

MARTIN

Away from here.

(CONTINUED)

2.

MARTIN

Pisswater.

DAN

At least it's cold pisswater.

Here's to getting away.

DAN

That was bad.

(bummed)

It's gonna take all day to get

another bus here.

MARTIN

You have a license?

DAN

Had one.    They took it away.

MARTIN

I got one.   Let's go.

DAN

See that?    They're all fake.

(CONTINUED)

3.

MARTIN

You take a hockey puck in the

face?

DAN

A fist. My stepdad socked me. I

flew across the room and dented

the sheetrock in the kitchen. My

mom saw everything and still took

his side.

MARTIN

You got cracked good.

DAN

I hate that guy. Two hundred

pounds of worthless grease.

MARTIN

Why'd he hit you?

DAN

I wrecked his sixty-five Mustang

and his boat in the same week.

His babies. I totaled them.

MARTIN

I would have popped you too.

DAN

It was worth it. But I didn't

deserve the tour in hell.

DAN

Don't ever go to military school

if you can help it. It sucks.

(a beat)

I jumped the wall two days ago.

MARTIN

You going back?

DAN

I'm done with that racket. I'm

going to Seattle and playing

music.

MARTIN

I know some chords.

DAN

Think you can learn drums?

4.

DAN

I'm the next Billy Squire. Krokus

will be opening for me one day.

DAN

Shit.

5.

WOMAN

I just saw my dead son get off the

ferry.

WOMAN

Listen to me; he's been dead

eighteen years. He just walked

right past me.

WOMAN

You need to open that grave.   It

can't be my son in there.

INSPECTOR

I lost my mother two years ago.

Every day I think I see her.

Driving to work in the car next to

me. At mass. Shopping, I see

her, but this is someone else's

mother. You see?

(CONTINUED)

6.

WOMAN

Inspector, I'm saddened by your

loss and touched by loyalty. But

let's focus on the matter at hand.

He walked right past me. We made

eye contact. I know he recognized

me. It was my son. A mother

knows these things. I will sign

anything, I will swear before a

judge. And thank you, I do have

all my faculties and friends who

can vouch for my character.

INSPECTOR

Did you talk to this man, he is a

man now?

WOMAN

Yes. Of course he's a man. He'd

be thirty-two. And no, I did not

speak with him. I ran.

(low, serious)

Inspector, my son was very, very

disturbed. He had serious

emotional problems. I assure you

he was.

(a beat)

Is. Is a dangerous person.

INSPECTOR

Madame. The police department

cannot resolve your problem. You

need to get permits from the

coroner and health and safety

department. You pay for an

exhumation. You have someone

qualified examine the remains. If

it is the wrong body, the Forensic

Examiner will confirm there is a

problem and call us. Then we open

an investigation.

(a beat)

No, Quebec City police will

investigate. He is buried there,

no?

WOMAN

No.   Inspector. He is not.

7.

WORKER

Someone call the cops.

CUT TO:

INSPECTOR LAVAL

(subtitled French)

Think she will like this?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

(subtitled French)

We are lucky the FBI is sending

her. She is the Michael Jordan of

criminal profiling.

(off Reynaud's look)

The Guy Le Fleuer of profiling.

She will save our ass.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

(subtitled French)

Inspector Laval.

(a beat)

Have the airline check again.

Look around baggage claim.

(to Reynaud)

She was on the flight but they

can't find her.

(CONTINUED)

8.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

(into phone)

Oui?

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

(subtitled French)

I know where she is.

CUT TO:

GRACE

It's okay, I'm supposed to be

here.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Agent Vanderholt, we requested

your help. I'm Inspector Laval,

this is Inspector Reynaud.

GRACE

Hi. Look, I'm not ready to talk

to you guys yet. I need a little

more time here.

(CONTINUED)

9.

GRACE

Would you mind trading one liners

somewhere else? I need to hear

the natural sounds. I appreciate

it.

10.

GRACE

Don't shoot, I'm on your team.

GRACE

Call who you have to call.   I

found his head.

DIRECTOR GILLET

I can't tell you how excited we

are to have you here.

GRACE

You only have one victim. Usually

there's two or three by the time I

get called in.

DIRECTOR GILLET

This case made page one of the

Globe. The tabloids say there is

a headhunter on the loose.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

11.

DIRECTOR GILLET (CONT'D)

The Mayor wants closure. That's

his vacation house they were

building. I get calls from

supervisors I didn't know I had.

GRACE

You clear the Mayor?

DIRECTOR GILLET

We cleared the Mayor. He read the

article on you in Newsweek and

insisted we fly you up. The

papers say two campers had a

drunken fight and the loser lost

his head.

GRACE

What do you think?

DIRECTOR GILLET

I don't solve crimes anymore, I

balance budgets.

GRACE

This was not a heat of the moment

killing. And the victim was

buried complete with head. The

grave was five-foot ten. The

victim's height. With square

corners. Dug with a shovel the

killer had the foresight to bring.

DIRECTOR GILLET

Thirty-five detectives searched

the area Saturday. My

investigators think you're a

witch.

GRACE

I've been called worse.

DIRECTOR GILLET

Jeez. Look at that, looks like he

got ice-picked.

(CONTINUED)

12.

GRACE

No. A large canine did that.

Probably an old or sick timber

wolf that couldn't hunt. It dug

up the body and chewed off the

head. It felt safe in the trees,

away from the riverbank, away from

the other wolves.

MEDICAL EXAMINER

I'd say you're right.

(into tape recorder)

Postmortem scavenger damage to C-1.

MEDICAL EXAMINER

The victim was afraid of dentists.

Bad teeth.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

This was a meter from the skull.

At soil level.

MEDICAL EXAMINER

Look at this.

GRACE

Bingo.   That's your murder weapon.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

It might be trash a camper left.

(CONTINUED)

13.

GRACE

No. Look at it, braided parachute

cord, two pieces of broom stick.

You approach the victim from

behind, loop it around his head

and hold on for all your might.

The more the victim struggles, the

quicker he passes out. And now

you have convenient handles to

drag around two hundred pounds of

dead kayaker.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

That is a theory.

GRACE

That's exactly what it is. A

theory. That evidence supports.

When the suspect is in custody you

can ask him yourself what happened

and you won't need me. Inspector.

DIRECTOR GILLET

Laval and Reynaud are my stars.

Very smart, very persistent

investigators. On the street;

they're magnificent.

GRACE

I can see that Director.   You're

lucky to have them.

GRACE

Go ahead, Director, say what you

have to say.

DIRECTOR GILLET

You're the expert. If you have

any suggestions on how to

proceed...

GRACE

Sure. A forensic anthropologist

can draw the victim's face based

on the skull. I know someone at

Quantico who can do it by

tomorrow.

(CONTINUED)

14.

DIRECTOR GILLET

We have people.

GRACE

Call 'em. Then show the results

to everybody around who was

selling outdoor goods two years

ago. You have his initials; MRC,

inside the wetsuit. The long hair

is distinctive, someone may

recognize him. It's a semi-long

shot.

DIRECTOR GILLET

No, that's bread and butter

detective work. Thank you.

(checks his watch)

We should get upstairs.

COUNCILMAN #1

You found the skull. Incredible.

GRACE

I had a case once where wild dogs

had removed remains.

COUNCILMAN #2

So I can tell my people there

isn't a headhunter running around

the wilds of Quebec?

GRACE

No headhunters, sir.   However, a

killer is out there.

(CONTINUED)

15.

COUNCILMAN #1

Director Gillet. Do you have the

victim identified?

DIRECTOR GILLET

No name yet, sir. We have someone

from the University recreating his

face from the skull.

COUNCILMAN #1

Why, after two years, has nobody

reported him missing?

GRACE

He wasn't missed. He had no

family, or moved often. He had

the musculature of a serious

outdoorsman. He spent a lot of

time in his kayak.

COUNCILMAN #1

The big question is who killed

him.

GRACE

Always is, sir. I can give you a

rough profile; white male, thirty

to thirty-four. Has some college

but no degree. Neat in

appearance. At least six feet

tall. Very intelligent. Charming

when necessary. He uses murder as

a tool, probably in furtherance of

a criminal endeavor. He's killed

before and will again unless

caught.

COUNCILMAN #1

We really appreciate the FBI

sending you. When can we expect

your report?

GRACE

A couple days, sir.

(CONTINUED)

16.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Say hello to a dead man.

GRACE

Shame.   Good-looking guy.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

This is more than we had. Thank

you.

GRACE

(into phone)

Vanderholt?

INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)

(filtered)

We named the victim; Curtis

Kohler. The forensic dentist just

verified the ID.

GRACE

With a C?

INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)

(filtered)

No. K-O-H-L-E-R. The initials

are for the Montreal River

Company. Kohler worked there as a

guide three years ago. The owner

remembers him because he stole the

wetsuit.

GRACE

Can you do a full records search?

Criminal, credit, commercial

history. Transcripts.

Everything.

(CONTINUED)

17.

INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)

(filtered)

Yes, of course.

GRACE

You're an awesome investigator,

Inspector. Run his name on every

database you can. I'll see you in

the morning.

GRACE

Fruit of the Gods. You know you

want one.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

(subtitled French)

Let's take her down the street. I

will not eat one of those hockey

pucks.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Let's go down the street. Very

good food. We are inviting you.

Please.

GRACE

Mr. Kohler has been dead two

years. No doubt about that.

Right?

(CONTINUED)

18.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Very solid time of death. Two

years ago.

GRACE

So before he died he got his

paychecks, paid his taxes.

Patronized sporting goods stores.

And had long spending gaps where

he was enjoying the great

outdoors. That pattern continues

a year after his death. He gets

some paychecks. Rents an

apartment. Buys a three thousand

dollar kayak. Pays his taxes.

Dead and buried and still paying

his taxes. Then everything stops.

Last Visa charge was to

Travelocity for a plane ticket to

Mexico city.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Dead men don't pay their bills.

It's identity theft.

GRACE

This isn't someone renting limos

and fancy dinners on someone

else's credit. Lifestyle and

habits don't change.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Computer error?

GRACE

Too many independent systems.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

(beat)

We work organized crime sometimes,

maybe a hit man wanted to lay low.

He assumed the life of a civilian

until things cooled off.

GRACE

You really think a gangster is

going to break his stride and

become a long hair groovy river

guide? Inspector, this guy's

whole life has been stolen.

Someone killed him and became him.

Down to profession and taste in

clothing.

19.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

You are a heavy sleeper.

GRACE

You're everywhere. What's up,

Laval?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

A man was killed tonight.

Attacked from behind. Asphyxiated

with a nylon cord with handles.

And there's a witness. Or a

suspect. We're not sure yet. We

should go.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

That's him.   He says he saw the

killer.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Meet Mr. Todd Ford.

GRACE

He's still warm.

(CONTINUED)

20.

GRACE

Want to get those?

GRACE

Where is it?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

There.   Under his car.

GRACE

Holy shit.   Has Le Directeur been

notified?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

I'm letting the poor man sleep a

couple more minutes.

(pointing things

out)

Twenty-four hour gym is there,

next door. He has a membership

card in his wallet. That's his

car. Car keys.

DIRECTOR GILLET

Is that our killer?

GRACE

Maybe. So far he checks out as an

art dealer from Winnipeg.

21.

COSTA

I walk out of the gym. Walk to my

car. I'm unlocking it and I hear

a scuffle, a fight. Over by this

car I see this guy getting choked

from behind and I shouted.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

What did you shout?

COSTA

'Stop.' I ran towards them. Then

the person doing the choking lets

go and pointed a gun at me and

ran. I'm so stupid. I could of

been shot. I called the police

gave him CPR until the paramedics

came.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

You touched him?

COSTA

Of course.   I was giving him CPR.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

You removed the Garrote?

COSTA

The thing around his neck? Yes.

I took it off, it was choking him.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Did you see where the attacker

went?

COSTA

Away from me.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

What kind of gun did he have?

COSTA

(frustrated)

The kind that puts really big

holes in people.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Was it black?    Was it silver?

(CONTINUED)

22.

COSTA

Black.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Okay, see? I am getting information.

He had a large black handgun.

COSTA

Listen to me. I can draw a

picture of his face. I saw him.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

You want to draw a picture?

COSTA

A sketch. I can sketch him.     I'm

very good.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

How could you see his face in the

dark?

COSTA

I did not do this. I saw two guys

fighting and should of ran the

other way but I didn't.

(as if to a child)

You need to find the person who

killed this man.

(in French)

You need to find the guy who did

this.

GRACE

You need to confirm he's a suspect

or clear him and kick-start a

manhunt based on Costa's ID. If

he is a legit witness, he'll get

heated up and start forgetting

details. I think there's a way to

clear him without pissing him off.

May I?

DIRECTOR GILLET

Please.

(CONTINUED)

23.

GRACE

Inspector.   I need a moment with

you.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

I was getting into his mind.

GRACE

I have a shortcut. Can you get

any of his school transcripts?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Sure.   It's all on-line.

GRACE

Call the Winnipeg Police and have

them fax or e-mail his driver's

license photo.

COSTA

I hope you guys are playing bad

cop smart cop.

GRACE

Sorry. I'm the dumb one. Agent

Vanderholt. Call me Grace.

COSTA

Thank you. He had these real

intense eyes.

(CONTINUED)

24.

GRACE

Hold on. Before you do that, I

need some personal information

from you. Can you write down the

name of the elementary school you

attended? And your elementary

school teachers, as many as you

can remember.

COSTA

Are you kidding me? Lady, I saw

someone get killed tonight and

you're asking me about grade

school?

GRACE

I apologize, I know it's random,

but it's the best way you can help

me.

COSTA

I don't remember any of that.

GRACE

Please, Mr. Costa. You'd be

surprised.

COSTA

(writing)

I attended two. Holy Trinity and

Mother of Good Counsel. I

remember Sister Bernard. And. I

don't know, Father Jeffrey. Mr.

Johansen. Oh, and Mrs. Sebastien,

she had a glass eye.

GRACE

May I?

COSTA

Omigod.   That's it, isn't it?

GRACE

That's what?

(CONTINUED)

25.

COSTA

The thing around his neck.

COSTA

I told the other guy, I'll tell

you. I did not do this. Grace.

I saw who did this and I can show

you what he looks like and you can

go catch him.

GRACE

Go ahead and draw the face of the

man you saw.

GRACE

We'll get an artist to help you.

COSTA

I can draw him, thank you.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

You left a file in there.

GRACE

I know. See if he tries to peek

in it. The real killer couldn't

resist. He'll want to know what

we know.

26.

GRACE

Can you remember any of your grade

school teachers? He remembered

three.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Here's his provincial driver's

license photo. He's checking out.

GRACE

Have a nurse take a DNA sample.

Just to make sure his DNA isn't in

the victim's car or anything

weird.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

We'll run the tests.

PARAMEDIC

Please open your mouth.

27.

MEDICAL EXAMINER

Fell out of his T-shirt when I

removed the clothing. It doesn't

fit the victim.

GRACE

(off the ring)

WVSS.   1995. What's that?

MEDICAL EXAMINER

West Vancouver Secondary School

Class of '95.

GRACE

CWE? Whose initials?   Not the

victim's.

MEDICAL EXAMINER

No. I called the school and had

someone find them in a yearbook.

Here's the original owner's name.

But it could have been through a

dozen pawn shops since then.

GRACE

Doctor, can I take you back to

Quantico with me?

MEDICAL EXAMINER

Sorry. I must remain where the

hockey is good.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

(into radio, subtitled

French)

This is Special Unit Fourteen. I

want a complete name search.

Clark William. Surname is

Edwards.

(CONTINUED)

28.

GRACE

Inspector Reynaud. Can we swing

by the crime scene before we head

back?

GRACE

Inspector.

GRACE

C'mere a second, please.

GRACE

Borrow your keys? Stand there

like you're going to choke me.

GRACE

Keys drop straight down, how'd

they end up over there under that

car?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

They were kicked. During the

struggle.

GRACE

(points)

Okay. Kick them as hard as you

can that way.

GRACE

Not even halfway.

(CONTINUED)

29.

GRACE

I had this case. This young

hundred-pound woman was abducted

from a parking lot. She kicked

off a mirror, broke a window,

dented her door. She struggled.

This guy? Nothing.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Everything you are saying, you are

saying one thing, do we trust

Costa?

GRACE

Good question.  Do we trust Costa?

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

Get in.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

I found a current address here in

Montreal.

GRACE

You guys have an extra weapon? I

didn't want to cross the border

armed.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

The glove box.

30.

SUPER

I never met him. We conducted our

business by phone.

GRACE

I smell smoke. Back where I'm

from anyone can kick a door if

there's a fire. It's the

'citizen's arrest' of search

warrants.

GRACE

Clear.

GRACE

Ugh.   Got a lung full.

(CONTINUED)

31.

GRACE

Looks like this guy ran out in the

middle of breakfast.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

We should get out of here. Don't

touch anything.

GRACE

Resembles the man Costa sketched.

(beat)

Have you released him? You don't

want your star witness steaming in

a holding cell.

(CONTINUED)

32.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

He went home twenty minutes ago.

Agent Grace, where do you think

Monsieur Edwards is?

GRACE

I bet Monsieur Edwards is in a

deep grave with square corners

like Messieurs Kohler and Ford.

Which looks like all the victims.

Maybe he's subconsciously killing

himself.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

We'll take that with us.

(in French)

Put a number and seal on that case.

GRACE

Ever see a Hermit crab?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

No.

GRACE

It's a crab that lives in the

shells of dead sea snails.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Yes, yes. They have one big claw

and curl up tight.

GRACE

When they outgrow an old shell,

they search for a new empty shell,

crawl up to it and quickly switch.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

33.

GRACE (CONT'D)

They live in these beautiful

shells because they have these

soft ugly bodies. They couldn't

survive without the shells.

Neither can the guy we're after.

DIRECTOR GILLET

We could have had him this

morning.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Director, please. We are getting

close. The hairs recovered from

the apartment match the hairs

recovered at the crime scene on

Ford's body. We found hours of

video like that of the victim. He

has been following him, filming

him for weeks. He tapped his

phone and has recordings of Ford's

calls. Even a CD with copies of

Mr. Ford's E-mail folders.

GRACE

With that much detail, you could

become anyone.

DIRECTOR GILLET

So he hunts people and wears their

lives as a kind of trophy.

GRACE

More like a kind of camouflage.

DIRECTOR GILLET

What's his real name?

(CONTINUED)

34.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

We know what he looks like, we

have his fingerprints, we know

what he had for breakfast. But

his name eludes us still.

DIRECTOR GILLET

(angry)

Find it, Laval. Find him.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Yes, sir.

GRACE

They're working really hard.

DIRECTOR GILLET

I know.

GRACE

Someone died last night because the

asshole we're after isn't in custody.

It's happened to me before and I'm

sure it will happen again. It's a

pretty miserable feeling.

DIRECTOR GILLET

I haven't felt it in a long time.

(a beat)

Dinner?

GRACE

Thank you. I promised the boys

I'd hang out tonight. I'm sorry.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

I'm fair and I keep my promises.

My informants trust me. I have

eyes on the trains, on the buses.

If they see him, they will tell

me.

(CONTINUED)

35.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

(subtitled French)

Maybe they will tell you. Why do

you trust junkies?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

(makes a fist)

I trust their fear of this.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

(subtitled French)

Don't say that in front of her.

GRACE

(subtitled French)

It's okay. I was a street cop in

Philadelphia for three years

before I joined the FBI.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

Very nice.   You like to play

games.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Mr. Ford worked as a cruise-ship

musician. He would walk around

and play his guitar on the decks

at night.

GRACE

Life is pretty cold sometimes.

Man's just trying to spread a

little music and gets murdered.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

He targeted Mr. Ford the night

before he was supposed to get on a

plane and meet a ship in Aruba.

GRACE

Only the new improved Mr. Ford was

going to meet he ship.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

Think he has a plan B?

(CONTINUED)

36.

GRACE

I doubt it. He's been so

meticulous and effective in the

past, I bet he's never needed one.

We can assume he has all sorts of

fake IDs and passports.

Disguises. But that's not enough

for him, he has to be someone

else. He gets off impersonating

people. And he knows his current

persona is compromised.

GRACE

What?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

You're always thinking. Save

something for tomorrow. We have

three boxes of evidence to go

through.

GRACE

Pretty cavalier attitude for a man

who just got his ass chewed by his

boss.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

My papa dropped dead of a heart

attack in front of a drill press

at work. Not me.

GRACE

I'm dropping by Costa's, I still

have a couple questions.

(off Laval's look)

I can't turn it off.

37.

GRACE

Mr. Costa.

COSTA

You caught me.

GRACE

Not yet.

COSTA

Toussant Jean Bernard. I met him

in Haiti last year. Very troubled

life. Outlived all his children.

And he had ten. He lost his wife

to cancer and went blind. Passed

away last year.

GRACE

Overpriced folk art. Is it the

work of a soul that has suffered?

Sure. Are his explorations as an

artist groundbreaking? No.

COSTA

Ouch. And I was going to send you

two and charge them to your Amex.

GRACE

I couldn't afford it.

COSTA

What about Daddy's Amex? I've

sold quite a bit of art to poor

little rich girls like you.

(CONTINUED)

38.

GRACE

Excuse me.

COSTA

Try the wine.

GRACE

I'm partial to beer. And I don't

have long. I came by to thank you

for your help. And I apologize if

you were detained. You did the

right thing. Trying to save him.

COSTA

Why, thank you. Agent Vanderholt.

(gives her a card)

I'm having a show Friday. You

should come by and meet some good

people.

GRACE

Who knows.   Where'd you learn CPR?

COSTA

Medical school. Before I dropped

out. I had a moment of clarity:

in anatomy class I realized I'd

rather draw bodies than cut them

up. And when I realized I couldn't

make art, I decided to sell it.

GRACE

Some journey.

COSTA

It's taken me all over the world.

GRACE

About Monday again, did you see

Mr. Ford fighting back?

COSTA

At first I thought I was

interrupting something, you know?

GRACE

No, I don't.

COSTA

I thought they were hugging. Then

the gun came out when he saw me.

(CONTINUED)

39.

GRACE

I guess that's it. Thanks.

GRACE

If you remember any details or

need anything.

(off his look)

Anything related to the case,

please call me.

COSTA

Okay. Think about Friday.

Please, Grace?

GRACE

Morning. Can you run this name?

She got twenty hang-up calls from

Edward's phone.

GRACE

What happened to that beautiful

thumbprint on the orange juice

glass, you get an ID?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

No hits. He's never been

fingerprinted.

GRACE

Shit. Any activity on Edward's

accounts?

(CONTINUED)

40.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Nothing. I think he became

Edwards a year ago. He was a

software engineer. Did everything

by the internet, he never met

anyone face to face.

GRACE

Why a year ago.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Edwards went on a river trip.

Kohler was a guide.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Those are E-mails between Kohler

and Edwards discussing the trip

one year ago.

GRACE

You connected Edwards and Kohler?

Somebody was working all night.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

I couldn't sleep.

GRACE

Our suspect kills Kohler on the

river, lives his life a year,

kills Edwards and assumes his ID

for a year. Then he stalks Ford,

kills him but is interrupted by

Costa. Think he's pissed at

Costa?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Of course.

YOUNG DETECTIVE

Agent Vanderholt, a report came

back on the name.

(CONTINUED)

41.

GRACE

She must have sounded like a total

fruitcake.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

This is it.

GRACE

Let me go and be non-threatening.

MRS. ASHER

Hi, please come in. Thank you for

coming.

MRS. ASHER

I'm glad they finally sent

someone, those hang-up calls have

me terrified. They started right

after I saw him.

(a beat)

I looked him directly in the eye.

There was a moment of mutual

recognition.

GRACE

Do you think it's Martin calling

and hanging up?

MRS. ASHER

It couldn't sound crazier, but who

else?

GRACE

Were you ever asked to identify

his body?

(CONTINUED)

42.

MRS. ASHER

The body? Yes, they showed me

some remains that had been hit by

a pickup truck. The upper body

was crushed. There was no face.

I got physically ill.

MRS. ASHER

You're not Canadian, are you?

GRACE

No.   I'm with the FBI.

MRS. ASHER

There was three. About two weeks

ago. I began turning off my

telephone when I go to bed.

GRACE

You have some very nice things,

Mrs. Asher.

MRS. ASHER

Thank you. Some of them have been

in my family for several generations.

Please call me Rebecca.

GRACE

Is that Martin?

MRS. ASHER

No. That's Reese. Martin's older

brother. He drowned in a terrible

accident.

GRACE

I'm so sorry, Rebecca.    How did he

drown?

MRS. ASHER

The San Michel River. Martin fell

out of their raft and Reese jumped

in to save him.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

43.

MRS. ASHER (CONT'D)

There was a lot of snowmelt that

year. Martin reached the bank.

Reese didn't. It was their

fourteenth birthday.

GRACE

Their fourteenth birthday?

MRS. ASHER

They were twins. Identical twins.

GRACE

You said Reese was older.

MRS. ASHER

By three minutes. They were very

different boys.

GRACE

To lose one son so young, then to

lose the other two years later; to

think you've lost him. That must

have been devastating.

MRS. ASHER

Reese was very charismatic and

outgoing. Martin was introverted.

He never thrived like Reese. He

was a very disturbed young man.

Reese was Martin's world. Martin

never recovered his equilibrium

after we lost him. He changed.

Martin began to intimidate me. He

could be very menacing. He began

imitating Reese at school and that

lead to fights with other

students. At sixteen he stole

some jewelry that was very

precious to me and ran away. A

few days later the Thunder Bay

police called and said my son had

been killed changing a tire.

GRACE

The police want you to sign this

so they can exhume the body in

Martin's grave and verify

identity.

(CONTINUED)

44.

MRS. ASHER

I'll sign it. I already know

somebody else's son is in that

casket.

MRS. ASHER

Excuse me.

(CONTINUED)

45.

MRS. ASHER (O.S.)

The bathroom is there.

GRACE

I know.     I was snooping.

MRS. ASHER

(re: the boys' room)

My friends call it the shrine.     It

can be difficult to let go.

GRACE

I know.

MRS. ASHER

He's killing people, isn't he?

GRACE

That doesn't surprise you?

MRS. ASHER

No.   It doesn't.

GRACE

That lady is definitely a queen

without a country. I should have

curtsied.

(watches him shave)

Hygiene on the road. Very

efficient.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Merde!

(CONTINUED)

46.

GRACE

She signed.   Start digging.

MEDICAL EXAMINER

Hmm. Could be worse after getting

run over by a pickup and twenty

years in the ground.

MEDICAL EXAMINER

Bodies get mixed up all the time.

Police found the wallet, called

the mother and nothing was cross-

checked. This was his head.

MEDICAL EXAMINER

(to the assistant)

Get that to Doctor Shivani and

make sure someone signs for it.

(to Grace)

She'll rebuild his jaw line and

check it against Martin Asher's

dental X-rays.

GRACE

How soon, sir?

MEDICAL EXAMINER

(shrugs)

This is a priority case, this

afternoon maybe.

47.

GRACE

(into phone, panting)

Vanderholt.

INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)

(filtered)

Am I interrupting something?

GRACE

Yes.   What?

INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)

The X-rays don't match.

GRACE

Find the real Martin Asher. He's

your killer.

(a beat)

You better get his mother someplace

safe.

GRACE

How'd she finagle a room there?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

She's a very slick woman.

(CONTINUED)

48.

GRACE

She didn't have one picture of

Martin. Not one. Even cut him

out of the old yearbooks. And she

had a basement door like a vault.

She's hiding something. In the

basement of her house. What is

it, ten minutes away from here?

Her house.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

If she's under our protection and

something happens to her house,

her belongings, the department

could be liable. There could be a

lawsuit.

GRACE

You're right. We should make sure

her front door is locked.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

I'll stay outside. Kill him if

he's in there.

GRACE

Yeah, I'll get 'em.

GRACE

Let's be friends.

49.

(CONTINUED)

50.

GRACE

I think I just shaved ten years

off my life.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Ah, you do feel fear.

GRACE

Yes. Rabies scares me.     Only

rabies. Nothing else.

GRACE

(into phone)

Vanderholt.

COSTA (V.O.)

(filtered)

Grace. Someone broke into my

office. Minutes ago.

GRACE

At the art gallery?

COSTA (V.O.)

Yes.   My office here.

GRACE

Are they still there?

COSTA (V.O.)

No.

GRACE

Did you call the police?

COSTA (V.O.)

You told me to call you if

anything happened.

(CONTINUED)

51.

GRACE

We'll be right there. I'm sending

a car. Don't touch anything.

COSTA

I do all my calls to Europe and

shipping stuff at night. My

address book was on the screen

when I went out for coffee. I

came back and this was on the

screen.

GRACE

How long were you gone?

COSTA

Ten minutes. Maybe. When I

returned, that was on the screen.

COSTA

Is this about the strangling?   Is

that guy after me?

GRACE

Please relax, Mr. Costa. We don't

know if there's a connection yet.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Is anything missing.

COSTA

No.  Everything's here.

(a beat)

Shit. He took my organizer and my

business checkbook.

52.

GRACE

How do we know Costa didn't stage

this? For attention or something.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

He's happy to see you. But the

alarm was jumpered. Do you think

Costa knows how to jumper an

alarm?

GRACE

We should take the computer.

COSTA

Don't take the computer.    That's

my brain.

COSTA

I'm not making this up.     Believe

me.

GRACE

Should I believe you?

GRACE

Or should I believe this.

COSTA

Believe what you want.

(CONTINUED)

53.

CUT WIDE TO:

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Is that the man you saw choking

Mr. Ford?

COSTA

I must of walked right past him.

GRACE

Mr. Costa, is that the man you saw

kill Mr. Ford in the parking lot?

COSTA

Yes. That's him. That is the man

I saw murder Todd Ford in the

parking lot outside my gym. No

doubt. Now will you go catch him,

please?

GRACE

Thank you.   I just needed you to

say it.

COSTA

Who is this guy? He's like a

Ninja. Sneaking into my office.

How dangerous is he? Does he want

to kill me?

GRACE

John, no harm will come to you.

Listen to me. No harm will come

to you. I promise. Anyone who

wants to hurt you will have to get

through these two for starters.

(CONTINUED)

54.

COSTA

How many people have you killed?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

You will be safe, my friend.

GRACE

We want you to be there tonight.

COSTA

No. I'm not meeting him.

Absolutely not. You ever go

fishing? The bait always dies.

GRACE

He won't get within fifty feet of

you. The second we see him, the

cuffs go on.

COSTA

(adamant)

Grace, no.

COSTA

What if he shoots me in the head?

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

I will take the bullet for you

like the Secret Service. Okay,

friend?

COSTA

You're good. You could move a lot

of art if you wanted to.

COSTA

And inspire some too, I'm sure.

55.

BARTENDER

Don't worry.   You're doing fine.

COSTA

Could you look any more like a

cop?

BARTENDER

What?

COSTA

Could I have some water?    I'm

cooking in this thing.

GRACE

Costa fits Asher's choice of

victims. Travels the World

looking for art. Single. No kids

or anything.

(looking around)

Asher's here somewhere. Watching.

With all the patience in the

world.

(CONTINUED)

56.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

I wish I had his patience. He

should be a cop. His mother

should be punished. Like the

owner of pit bulls that attack

kids.

GRACE

You got kids?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Three.

GRACE

Don't keep them in a cage.

(CONTINUED)

57.

BLACK MAN

Go outside.

COSTA

What?

BLACK MAN

We're calling it off.

COSTA

I have a life. I can't play

superhero for you. I don't handle

stress very well. I have an art

show to open tomorrow and I don't

know what I'm putting on the walls

yet.

GRACE

I know you have a life. So did

the people who have lost theirs.

Someone else might die if you do

not help us. Every time someone

dies it affects forty, fifty

lives.

COSTA

Grace, I've been cooperating. I

even drew you a picture. You

can't put your responsibility on

me. You have a badge, not me.

GRACE

If somebody else dies, and you

know you could have done more to

stop it, you're going to feel like

shit for a very long time, Mr.

Costa.

(CONTINUED)

58.

COSTA

I want to help you guys but I

don't have time to hang out and

listen to bad techno.

GRACE

It's okay to be scared.

COSTA

Scared? I'm off-the-charts

terrified. There's a pissed-off

serial killer after me. I mean,

what did I do to him?

GRACE

You saw him and that's enough.

Don't stop living your life.

You'll be protected by armed

officers twenty-four seven.

COSTA

Until he's caught?

GRACE

(softly)

I can't promise you that.

COSTA

I have a lot of work to do.

GRACE

A car is watching the gallery.

You'll be okay.

DIRECTOR GILLET

So who was in Asher's grave?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Dan Soulsby. He went missing from

the Alberta Military Institute two

days before the accident.

(CONTINUED)

59.

GRACE

I'm sure Soulsby's death was a

homicide, Asher saw the

opportunity and took it. He

became Soulsby and bummed around

Seattle for a couple years.

DIRECTOR GILLET

Why is Asher after Costa? Why

isn't he in Mexico getting a new

face?

GRACE

Costa saw him. Costa caught him

in the act, caught him being

Martin Asher. Seen first by his

mother, then by Costa. For the

first time he's failed at taking a

life, and since we found the

apartment, he can't be Edwards.

To be seen, to be recognized, is a

horrifying thing to Asher. He has

no identity and wants it that way.

DIRECTOR GILLET

Where is the real Mr. Edwards?

GRACE

Likely dead and buried south of

the border somewhere.

(beat)

South of the American border

somewhere. Visa records put

Asher, using Kohler's ID and

Edwards at a Mexican surf resort.

Edwards' last charge was sixteen

hundred dollars at a 'no questions

asked' facelift clinic in

Guadalajara.

DIRECTOR GILLET

Have you contacted the clinic?

INSPECTOR LAVAL

Yes. They are also 'no questions

answered.' Mr. Kohler suddenly

paid off his credit card bills,

thanks to money from Edwards.

(CONTINUED)

60.

DIRECTOR GILLET

Keep's the collection agencies off

the trail. How do we flush Mr.

Asher?

GRACE

He's focused on Costa. Who fits

the profile of Asher's victims.

He went on Costa's computer and E-

mailed copies of Costa's files to

an E-mail account in Denmark.

Constant threat of discovery,

Asher will become more

disorganized.

DIRECTOR GILLET

Okay. My office will arrange a

press conference. I will tell a

room full of correspondents we

have a suspect who is dead and

murder victims who are alive. And

I'll sound like a madman.

GRACE

It does sound crazy. That's what

the press likes, sir.

DIRECTOR GILLET

Mr. Asher, we know who you really

are. We will find you and we will

arrest you. You can hide no

longer.

61.

CARPENTER

Mr. Costa, some men in that car

have been watching this place all

morning.

COSTA

They're protecting the art. Go

ahead and hang those. Be very

careful.

CARPENTER

Yessir.

GRACE

Security is going to be very solid

tonight.

COSTA

Is he going to show up tonight?

What do I do, offer him a drink?

GRACE

He won't show. But we want to be

here in case he does. Four

plainclothes officers will form a

perimeter watching the four

corners.

COSTA

A perimeter, excellent.

GRACE

Yes. And four plainclothes

officers will be in here.

Mingling.

COSTA

Mingling? I don't need four

bruisers crashing through my

clientele.

(CONTINUED)

62.

GRACE

The officers will be very

discreet. We won't interfere with

your thing.

COSTA

With my thing.    Will you be

mingling?

GRACE

Sure.     If you feel safer.

COSTA

Much safer.

INSPECTOR LAVAL

(subtitled French)

This painting costs more than my

house.

GRACE

Thanks.

COSTA

You look a little anxious.

GRACE

(re: her dress)

This isn't me.

(CONTINUED)

63.

COSTA

It's all you.

GRACE

I'm trying to get into the show,

but I mean. What is this? It

looks like somebody napalmed the

Garden of Eden.

COSTA

Mangos.   Ripe mangos hanging on a

branch.

GRACE

Oh. Okay. Why the borders?

Almost every painting has one.

Was he in prison or something?

COSTA

Most people don't notice. This is

from his prison series. He could

see a mango grove through his cell

window. He made some of the

pigments himself. From flowers.

From his own blood.

GRACE

What was his crime?

COSTA

He attacked his neighbor with a

machete. There was a woman

involved.

GRACE

Always is.

GRACE

He had a lot of lovers, didn't he?

COSTA

Dozens. He was a consumer of

life's pleasures.

(CONTINUED)

64.

GRACE

Now he's dead and you get rich?

COSTA

His children formed a corporation,

I take ten percent. I'm not a

buccaneer, Grace.

COSTA

What?

GRACE

I don't think I've ever met anyone

quite like you.

COSTA

You're very sensitive for...

GRACE

An FBI agent?

ELEGANT WOMAN

John, it's amazing tonight. I

want to cry, I'm so touched.

GRACE

Mr. Costa, I would like to discuss

an arrangement for the series.

ELEGANT WOMAN

Just a sec, John.

COSTA

What are you doing?

GRACE

She's not writing the checks.

(CONTINUED)

65.

OLDER MAN

John, it's incredible what you've

put together.

(aside to Costa)

The thing we were talking about

the other day, well I'd like to

proceed. Hell, I'm sick of making

two percent in the market.

COSTA

Dick, they're yours.

GRACE

Don't you miss wax?

COSTA

You helped me close the biggest

sale of the night.

GRACE

What's my cut?

COSTA

What do you want?

GRACE

I don't know.

COSTA

Let me know when you do.   Excuse

me.

(CONTINUED)

66.

ASHER

Put your hands on the wall.

ASHER

Feel that?

COSTA

Please be cool with that.    I don't

wanna get hurt.

ASHER

I should blow your spine out. My

face is everywhere. I have to

hide in the shadows like a fucking

animal because of you.

COSTA

Yessir. I apologize for

everything you think I may have

done.

ASHER

We're moved past sorry. You

ruined everything. John, soon to

be dead, Costa.

COSTA

Stop it!

67.

ASHER

Out of my way!

COSTA

I'm okay.

INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)

(filtered, subtitled

French)

Jean, he ran into the damn crowd.

Shit.     You see him?

(CONTINUED)

69.

70.

(CONTINUED)

71.

GRACE (O.S.)

Need a ride home?

COSTA

The night started out great.

Everything gelled. Everyone was

happy. You helped land a big fish

and the feeding frenzy started.

Six figure pieces were flying off

the wall.

(shivers)

He said he was going to blow out

my spine. I was thinking surgery.

Six months in bed. Exercise

pools. Never walking again.

(CONTINUED)

72.

COSTA

He was in my bathroom and none of

you could stop him. I need to

leave town.

GRACE

That might be a good idea. Until

then I'll check under your bed for

monsters.

COSTA

I would appreciate that very much.

(a beat)

Can I profile you? I read your

book.

GRACE

Please, don't.

COSTA

Thirty-something, single white

female. Best schools best grades.

Discovers adrenaline policing the

inner city.

GRACE

(cuts in)

John, stop it. Please. Let's

shift the conversation from me and

my business onto something

inbounds.

COSTA

Okay. Are you going to my funeral

when Martin Asher cuts my throat?

COSTA

You let him get away.

GRACE

No excuses.   I'm sorry.

COSTA

I meant you in the general sense.

(a beat)

Can you catch him?

(CONTINUED)

73.

GRACE

We got his name. We catch

everyone sooner or later.

COSTA

Sooner, please.

COSTA

Careful.

COSTA

I'm sorry. It's a sty.    Must be a

profiling mother lode.

GRACE

I'm done profiling you.   I got you

figured out.

COSTA

A failed healer, a failed artist.

GRACE

Is that how you see yourself?

COSTA

No. That's you. I did it last

night.

GRACE

This is how you see me?

COSTA

No. It's how I think you see

yourself.

(CONTINUED)

74.

GRACE

And how do you see me?

COSTA

That would be out of bounds.

COSTA

What was that?

GRACE

I don't know. John, games are

fun. But head games are

dangerous.

COSTA

Then keep your head out of it.

GRACE

The Justice minister is going to

relocate you to another city until

Mr. Asher is in custody.

COSTA

I don't know what your deal is.

One second you're so there, then

all I get is the badge.

GRACE

I apologize if you've been getting

the wrong signal.

COSTA

Yeah.   Relocate where?

GRACE

Another province. They want you

on a flight tomorrow morning.

COSTA

This monster comes into my life

and I have to leave?

SERGEANT

My people are in place.

GRACE

Thank you, Sergeant.

COSTA

This is surreal. What do I pack?

GRACE

What you need.   Movers can get the

rest.

COSTA

I need tomorrow morning to finish

up my business here.

GRACE

I'll let them know.

COSTA

I thought you were going to check

under my bed.

GRACE

No monsters.

COSTA

Thank you.

I probably won't see you again

until the trial. If there is a

trial.

COSTA

Goodbye, then.

I'm not leaving.

ASHER

Jesus, he was a cop. He's dead

the choice. The choice to fuck

with me. That, John, was a very

bad choice.

COSTA

Which way?   Left, right?

ASHER

Left.

ASHER

You're dead, John Costa. You

fucked with the wrong man,

shitsmear.

ASHER

Faster, asshole.

COSTA

I'm flooring it.

ASHER

Shut up.   Faster.

ASHER

Give me your wallet.   Give it

over. Right now.

ASHER

There.   Turn there.

ASHER

Careful.

COSTA

Okay. Sorry. Sorry.      You don't

want to do this.

ASHER

Yes I do. John, do you have any

killed? It's always been

business. This time is personal.

COSTA

Please be cool. C'mon, we don't

even know each other.

ASHER

Shut up. Art Man. You are stupid

thigh. Will that get your

attention.

COSTA

Don't, man. I got money. You

want money, I'll give you money.

I got paintings. What do you

want? Talk to me, Martin.

ASHER

I am not Martin. There is no

Martin.

COSTA

Of course. No Martin. What do

you want? What's my life worth to

you?

ASHER

Nothing. And everything. This is

deeper than money. Shut up. Talk

is done. Talk is over.

Understand that. You are over.

DIRECTOR GILLET

How's Mr. Costa?

He got off light. With a broken

man.

DIRECTOR GILLET

My luck has run out. Until today

I have never had to bury a friend.

Hey.

Ouch, Doc. That's not rawhide.

You okay?

I'm okay.    Thank you for rescuing

me.

Anytime. Do you know where he was

taking you?

To my grave.    He was going to kill

me.

It's over.

Let me take you out tonight.

Let's have some fun. I owe you

What's fun for you? You want to

go to the shooting range or the

morgue?

COSTA

I'm sorry.

GRACE

It's going to   take a couple days

to depose you   and get a full

statement. I    thought you might

enjoy a break   before you have

to...

COSTA

I know a place. You drive.

COSTA

I'm happy to be alive but it's

like this door has been opened.      I

don't think I was naive. But

everything is different now.

GRACE

You'll fold this experience into

your life and be stronger for it.

COSTA

How do you deal with it? All the

misery and pain and violence.

GRACE

I can stop monsters, John.     And

because I can, I have to.

COSTA

So is it a calling or a curse?

GRACE

Neither.   It's just my job.

COSTA

When I was in med school I saw a

guy on a Harley get T-boned by a

Daihatsu. He was screaming in

pain and needed help and I knew

what to do, I had all my certs,

but I saw all this blood and

froze. I failed the big test.

Bye-bye, med school. Hello,

graphic design.

You're a sharp one, John Costa.

COSTA

You threw me in a tiger cage like

a piece of meat.

GRACE

That's right. You were the cheese

in the trap. We stopped a monster.

That's what matters.

GRACE

I'm sorry.   I'm a pig.

COSTA

I don't trust anyone who's too

organized.

GRACE

Want a beer?

COSTA

Please.

COSTA

Which is it, are you a runner or

chaser?

GRACE

What's that mean?

COSTA

People like you --

GRACE

People like me?

(CONTINUED)

89.

COSTA

Yeah, people like you. Hardcore.

Gung-ho people like you. And you

know what I mean. People like you

are either runners or chasers.

GRACE

You are a trip, John Costa.

GRACE

Okay. I guess I'm running and

chasing.

COSTA

I'm sorry.   I didn't know.

GRACE

Growing up I quit speaking after

that. I didn't say a word for

three years. When you're not in

the conversation, you get

forgotten real quick. So I'd

watch people. Study them. The

mouth can say anything, but the

body doesn't lie. The tilt of the

head, the way the hands move.

COSTA

How'd you get your voice back?

GRACE

The day my Uncle died. The truth

exploded out of me like a vision.

My Uncle and Father had been

arguing, there was a gunshot and

my father was dead.

COSTA

You are very intense, you know

that?

GRACE

I remember my Uncle telling me not

to say anything. And I didn't.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

90.

GRACE (CONT'D)

I made myself forget why. The day

he died my voice and my memory

came back. I screamed for an

hour. Very primal. I haven't

shut up since.

COSTA

Why did your Uncle do it?

GRACE

Land. Great-grandpa owned half of

Pennsylvania. My Uncle wanted

control and sold it all. All

that's left is an old farmhouse

and a horse pasture.

(sadly)

My father's murderer got away with

it because I couldn't open my

mouth.

COSTA

That's a hell of a lot of

responsibility for you to put on

the shoulders of an eight-year-old

girl.

GRACE

Something good game out of it.

The dead can't speak. Now I'm

their voice.

GRACE

Martin Asher is dead, right?

COSTA

Can we please forget about him?

GRACE

That's the point. He's dead, so

there won't be a trial where you

or I would have to admit under

oath that we did anything

inappropriate.

(CONTINUED)

91.

COSTA

We haven't done anything.

GRACE

Jesus.

COSTA

In college we tried to make my

friend's German Shepherd take a

bong hit.

GRACE

How mean.   Serves you right.

COSTA

Let them watch.

92.

GRACE

John.    John.

COSTA

Mmmmm.   Morning.

COSTA

My stitches must have ripped.

GRACE

I thought you were scared of

blood?

COSTA

You better take a shower.

MEDICAL EXAMINER

Please don't touch the remains.

(CONTINUED)

93.

MRS. ASHER

Nineteen years ago I stood in this

same room and your predecessor

showed me a washtub full of blood

and guts and told me it was my

son. I will touch anything I

want, Doctor. I'm not going

through this a third time.

MRS. ASHER

It's not him. That's not my

blood. You people are incredible.

MEDICAL EXAMINER

I'll swab your cheek and test your

DNA against the body. Will that

do it?

MRS. ASHER

Good idea, Doctor. He's smarter

than all of you, do you know that?

COSTA

Is that going to hold?   I'm not

coming back.

COSTA

What's wrong?

GRACE

That was my boss. I'm going back

to Quantico tomorrow.

(CONTINUED)

94.

COSTA

Washington, DC has some of the

best art in the world. Georgetown

would be a great place to open a

gallery.

GRACE

Staple his mouth too, Doc.

GRACE

Vanderholt.

MEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.)

Grace. I ran Mrs. Asher's DNA

against the suspect down here. No

way it's her son.

GRACE

Not her son?   You're sure?

MEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.)

Lab ran the test twice.

GRACE

That's weird. Was he adopted,

switched at birth?

MEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.)

Listen for a minute. There was a

match. John Costa is Mrs. Asher's

biological son.

GRACE

So John Costa is really Martin

Asher?

MEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.)

Dear God, I wish I was joking.

(CONTINUED)

95.

GRACE

Are you Martin?

COSTA

Grace, I'm John. Okay?      I'm John.

GRACE

Holy shit.

ASHER

She screwed it up, didn't she?

GRACE

Who?

(CONTINUED)

96.

ASHER

I should have cut her throat when

I saw her on the ferry. That's

the least she deserves. Please

don't do anything, Grace. It

would hurt me so much if I had to

hurt you.

GRACE

Good idea.   Don't hurt me.

GRACE

Shit!

GRACE

Police emergency. We need to

pursue him. He's a murder

suspect.

GRACE

Director Gillet, there's an

emergency, can you please tell

this officer to cooperate with me?

97.

ASHER

Hello, Mother.

GRACE

No answer.     She turns her phone

off.

ASHER

What happened to Rex?     He was a

real dog, right, Mom?

(CONTINUED)

98.

MRS. ASHER

Don't show me that, Martin. I had

Rex put down after you ran away.

Martin, sit.

MRS. ASHER

How dare you defy me. You will

sit down on that couch and you

will do it now. Martin.

MRS. ASHER

Martin, you have severe emotional

problems. I know you're in a lot

of pain. There's hope and help,

Martin. Look at me, Martin. I

love you very much.

MARTIN

I know now that what you did to me

was not love.

ASHER

I'll stand if I want to stand. I

can do anything I want to do. And

I've done some great things,

Mother. I'm not a scared little

boy you can push around anymore.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

I hope the son of a bitch doesn't

shoot me with the gun you gave

him. What else did you give

Asher?

(CONTINUED)

99.

GRACE

Shut up and focus. That kind of

shit helps no one right now.

GRACE

Get right, I got left.

GRACE

Don't move!

GRACE

Omigod.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

He's gone.

100.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

My best friend died protecting a

serial killer so you could get

laid. Very nice.

GRACE

That's none of your business.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

No?    It's my case.

GRACE

Back off, Reynaud. Asher fooled

you too.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

At least I didn't fuck him.

GRACE

Touch me again and I will kick

your ass.

INSPECTOR REYNAUD

I am taking you to the Director.

DIRECTOR GILLET

They're on their way from the

airport.

DIRECTOR GILLET

Your old life is over. There is

no going back.

(CONTINUED)

101.

GRACE

I know.

DIRECTOR GILLET

You're still young. Whatever

happens, be strong.

(beat)

Where is he, Grace? How do we

find him?

GRACE

Director, I'm the last person you

should be discussing the case with

at this point.

DIRECTOR GILLET

Grace.    You know his mind, and his

heart.    Where is he?

GRACE

Not here. This city no longer has

the psychic gravity to hold him

here. Try Mexico, getting a

facelift.

DIRECTOR GILLET

We ID'd the remains in the morgue.

The real ID.

GRACE

(reads)

Richard Hart.

DIRECTOR GILLET (V.O.)

He was an addict. And a thief.

An art thief. He hits galleries

in Europe and North America.

Traveled back and forth smuggling

and selling stolen canvasses.

102.

GRACE

Let me guess, Costa was selling

stolen art for Hart and never gave

him the money. Now Hart is just

another one of Asher's victims.

DIRECTOR GILLET

Costa owed him eight thousand.

Those are E-mails off Hart's

computer.

GRACE

(reading)

Go to hell. I won't pay you a

dime. I'm not scared of you.

GRACE (V.O.)

Come and get me. I will never pay

you, dumbass.

(thinks a beat)

Asher taunted Hart into a

confrontation. Jesus. It was

right there in my face. I was

interpreting behavior from two

different suspects.

DIRECTOR GILLET

He had us all fooled, Grace. All

of us. If Asher can do that, what

else can he do?

GRACE

Anything he wants.

GRACE

Ah, the undertakers have arrived

for my career.

(CONTINUED)

103.

SENIOR AGENT

Have your rights been explained to

you and has an indication to that

effect been made in your employee

record?

GRACE

Yessir.

SENIOR AGENT

Agent Vanderholt. Why would Asher

kill Ford, if nobody knew he was

Costa. If he wasn't going to use

Ford's identity?

GRACE

He needed a murder he could link

not only Richard Hart to but also

to his past victims.

GRACE (V.O.)

Hart's behavior was consistent

with a disorganized drug addict

following the rules of the

criminal road by attempting to

kill a debtor who won't pay. He

had no idea he was being

manipulated by a serial killer.

104.

GRACE (V.O.)

Asher wasn't becoming disorganized

and decomposing into madness, he

was evolving.

GRACE (V.O.)

The Ford murder was staged and I

missed it. Asher drove Ford's car

there with Ford unconscious in the

car. Ether maybe, GHB. Something

that disappears. Asher works out,

heads to the parking lot. Pulls

Ford out of the trunk. And

strangles him. He left a couple

of Hart's hairs on the body.

GRACE (V.O.)

He draws a nice portrait of Mr.

Hart and he's now inside the heart

of Montreal PD's investigation.

(CONTINUED)

105.

GRACE (V.O.)

Evidence at the Ford crime scene

led to an apartment with more of

Hart's DNA. And evidence linking

Hart to Asher's crimes. Hart

never set food in that apartment.

Asher staged everything.

SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)

Mr. Hart, not Asher, murdered the

Montreal Inspector, correct?

GRACE (V.O.)

Yes. Hart thought Costa was

systematically destroying his

life. Hart's violent explosion

was inevitable.

SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)

How could Asher plan on Hart

snapping like that?

GRACE (V.O.)

He couldn't. My guess is Asher

intended to kill Hart and make it

look like suicide. The

authorities would find the body

and close the Martin Asher file.

SENIOR AGENT

This ethics panel has no choice

but to recommend terminating you

for misconduct. Do you wish to

make a statement?

SENIOR AGENT

Please speak up for the record.

GRACE

No.   I have nothing to say.

106.

COLTON

Grace. This is a bitter loss to

the unit.

GRACE

You'll manage.

COLTON

Want some good news? RCMP closed

their investigation and the

Minister isn't indicting you.

This could have been a real train

wreck for you, Grace.

GRACE

It wasn't?

COLTON

No one has any clue where Asher

is. That son of a bitch might

fixate on you. Please watch your

back, Grace.

GRACE

I'll dig a hole and hide in it.

COLTON

Don't fade away, Grace.   You're

still my friend, okay?

107.

GRACE

Hello?

ASHER (V.O.)

I'm sorry.    I'm sorry you lost

your job.

ASHER (V.O.)

Hello?

GRACE

I'm here.

ASHER (V.O.)

I miss you.

GRACE

Why don't you come and see me. I

miss you, too. I'm at the

Gainesville Virginia. The Motel 6

off Highway 29. Stop by.

108.

PREGNANT WOMAN

Wow, you know the question?

GRACE

Six months.

PREGNANT WOMAN

That's it?

GRACE

Twins.

PREGNANT WOMAN

Good luck, sweetheart. Get

yourself home, it's miserable out.

(CONTINUED)

109.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

The State Police have said to stay

off the road unless it's an

absolute emergency. Several of

their cruisers have already been

damaged. There is ice everywhere.

On the way in tonight I saw the

snowplow slipping and sliding.

Everybody, stay where you are.

This is only the beginning.

(CONTINUED)

110.

ASHER

Hi, Grace.

ASHER

Knock it off.    You're not going

anywhere.

ASHER

I'm not going to hurt you.

GRACE

You're so full of shit your eyes

turned brown.

ASHER

They're contacts. You're glowing.

GRACE

How the fuck did you find me?

ASHER

You told me everything I had to

know.

(CONTINUED)

111.

GRACE

Get it over with. Just get it

over with.

ASHER

Ever since I met you, you're all I

can think about. I had a way of

life. And I can't go back to

because of you. I want you in my

life, Grace. Please listen to me,

Grace. I have a proposal.

ASHER

You become her. I become him.    We

are married, see?

ASHER

We have the babies. We raise

them. However you want. I just

want to be with you.

GRACE

What happens if I don't want to

assume this woman's identity and

raise my babies with a serial

killer?

ASHER

Grace, don't be morbid. If anyone

can deal with this, you can. I

know you felt what I felt. It's

real.

GRACE

Answer my question.

ASHER

I'll shoot you in the head and

burn this place down.

(CONTINUED)

112.

GRACE

You'll do what you have to do. I

can respect that. How do you know

it's still real? Maybe it's gone.

What we felt.

GRACE

God, I missed you so much.

ASHER

I searched everything.

ASHER

Damn you!

113.

ASHER

Keep fucking running, Grace,

you're only going to die tired!

(CONTINUED)

114.

ASHER

Shit!

GRACE

Better you than me, asshole.

FADE OUT.

THE END
