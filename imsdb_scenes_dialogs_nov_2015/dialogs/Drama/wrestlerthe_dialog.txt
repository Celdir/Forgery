Yeah, like graduate in 1985.

RANDY

(to Dude #2)

Apologize to this lady.

DUDE #3

Who the hell are you?

RANDY

You speak to her with respect.

CASSIDY

CASSIDY

Did I ask for help?

(BEAT)

Did I need help?

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

Then don't fuckin' help.

RANDY

You're right. I'm sorry.

(BEAT)

I'm sorry.

23.

CASSIDY

That's okay.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

Good to see ya, man.

CUT TO:

RANDY

We're talking one of the historic

matches in history. 20,000 people.

Another million and a half watching

at home on pay-per-view.

RANDY (CONT'D)

We were going back and forth, just

killin' each other for a half hour.

Any wrestling fan, they know all

about it.

CASSIDY

Million and a half? Shit.

RANDY

Yeah, it was big. So a rematch...

(smiles, contemplating the

PROSPECT)

History all over again.

RANDY (CONT'D)

Goddamn you are smokin'.

24.

RANDY (CONT'D)

Who knows. I put on a good show...

RANDY (CONT'D)

Could be the thing that gets me

back on top.

CASSIDY

You never know who's in that crowd.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

Jesus.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

You're bleeding.

RANDY

Got cut tonight.

CASSIDY

You okay?

RANDY

Ah, it's nothing.

CASSIDY

(small chuckle)

And they say wrestling's fake.

RANDY

How's this for fake?

25.

CASSIDY

What's that from?

RANDY

1986. Denver Coliseum. Billy Bob

Banjo hit me with his two-by-four.

Loose nail tore the bicep open.

CASSIDY

Ow. Fuck.

RANDY

I got even better.

RANDY (CONT'D)

1988. Orlando Arena. Mr.

Magnificent tossed me out of the

ring. Landed on my shoulder,

clavicle snapped in half.

CASSIDY

Doesn't it hurt?

RANDY

(BLISSFUL)

Not when they're going crazy for

you...

CASSIDY

"He was pierced for our

transgressions, He was crushed for

our iniquities. The punishment that

brought us peace was upon Him, and

by His wounds we were healed."

RANDY

What's that?

CASSIDY

It's from "Passion of the Christ".

(BEAT)

You never seen it?

26.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

Dude, you gotta. It's amazing.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

It's, like, so inspiring. They

throw everything at Him. Whips,

arrows, rocks... Just beat the

living fuck out of Him for the

whole two hours. And He just takes

it.

RANDY

Huh. I'll have to check it out.

CASSIDY

The sacrificial Ram...

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

Ah, shit.

CLUB D.J. (O.S.)

And now, please welcome to the

Cheetah's stage...

CLUB D.J. (O.S.) (CONT'D)

RANDY

What do I owe?

CASSIDY

Just gimme for three.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

You'll wait `til I'm done?

27.

CUT TO:

LEX LETHAL

RANDY

No prob. You're right on the way.

RANDY (CONT'D)

So how big's this place?

LEX LETHAL

Nice. Two, two-fifty...

(BEAT)

You been there. The Ricky Whipsaw

memorial benefit.

RANDY

(PLEASED)

That place?

LEX LETHAL

Should get a good gate. DiFusco

says he's gotten like 20 calls last

two days alone.

28.

RANDY

God bless hardcore...

RANDY

Whatcha think?

LEX LETHAL

Cookie trays were better.

LEX LETHAL (CONT'D)

Hell, yeah.

RANDY

Let's see if they got extension

cords.

Mr. Ramovic.

RANDY

Call me Randy.

RANDY (CONT'D)

So how we lookin', doc?

DR. TARACHANDANI

A lot better than before the

bypass.

RANDY

Great. So I'm all good.

DR. TARACHANDANI

Your heart... You're going to have

to start taking much better care of

it.

RANDY

Like...

DR. TARACHANDANI

For starters, you must take your

medication every day.

RANDY

I could handle that.

DR. TARACHANDANI

No smoking.

(Randy nods)

And no cocaine.

35.

RANDY

(defensive, offended)

I don't do coke.

DR. TARACHANDANI

It's all over your blood work.

RANDY

(sheepish, busted)

Maybe once in a while.

DR. TARACHANDANI

Well, it has to be never.

DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D)

As for exercise, it's still okay,

as long as it's moderate.

RANDY

So, like, wrestling...

DR. TARACHANDANI

Not a good idea.

RANDY

What if I do it moderate? I could

hold back on certain moves. There's

always ways to fake----

DR. TARACHANDANI

Mr. Ramovic...

RANDY

(edgy glare)

Randy.

DR. TARACHANDANI

Randy, a man with your heart should

not be flying around a ring

crashing into people.

RANDY

With all due respect, Dr...

(reads name tag,

MISPRONOUNCING)

...Trachanani, I'd like a second

opinion on that.

36.

DR. TARACHANDANI

Of course. But I promise you, any

doctor I showed your file would say

the same thing.

DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D)

You almost died. The next time, you

won't be so lucky.

RANDY

I want a second opinion.

DR. TARACHANDANI

Your heart's been through a lot.

Even before the heart attack, it

was significantly----

RANDY

I want a second opinion.

(BEAT)

I WANT A SECOND OPINION.

ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN

RANDY

It's a folding chair.

40.

ADAM

That's a chair?

RANDY

(PISSY)

Yes, it's a chair.

ADAM

This is old.

RANDY

1988 ain't old.

ADAM

That was, like, 50 years before I

was born.

RANDY

Shut up and fight.

ADAM'S MOM (O.S.)

Ad-aam!

Coming!

RANDY

RANDY

How `bout later, then?

CASSIDY

You okay?

RANDY

CASSIDY

Sure. What's up?

RANDY

Someplace more quiet.

CASSIDY

RANDY

I had a heart attack.

CASSIDY

Shit. When?

RANDY

I needed to talk to somebody.

CASSIDY

You can't talk here?

RANDY

Just a couple minutes.

CASSIDY

Randy, I don't do that.

RANDY

Please.

CASSIDY

RANDY

Thanks. I appreciate it.

CASSIDY

That's okay.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. That's fucked up, dude.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

When was it?

RANDY

Last week.

CASSIDY

You okay?

44.

RANDY

Yeah, yeah. Feelin' much better.

CASSIDY

Good, good. What happened?

RANDY

It was while I was wrestling. I

collapsed in the ring.

CASSIDY

Oh, man. That's terrible.

RANDY

Yeah, it was pretty fucked up.

RANDY (CONT'D)

Tell ya, though, it was a big hit

with the fans.

(amused grin)

Promoter told me everybody was

hanging around wondering if I was

okay, they wound up buying up all

of his T-shirts and shit. Whole

merch table got cleaned out.

CASSIDY

That's funny.

RANDY

Doctor says I can't wrestle no

more.

CASSIDY

Damn. What are you gonna do?

RANDY

I don't know. I don't know what to

do. If I can't wrestle...

CASSIDY

It just happened. You don't have to

figure everything out this second.

Give yourself some time.

RANDY

Time's all I got. I just sit there

all day...

45.

CASSIDY

You really shouldn't be alone right

now.

RANDY

That's why I came to see you.

CASSIDY

(a little unnerved)

Randy...

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

I feel bad what happened. But you

and me... I can't go there.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

You should be with family now. You

have a daughter, right? Where is

she?

RANDY

We don't really get along too good.

CASSIDY

It doesn't matter. You need her.

RANDY

(bitter chuckle)

She don't need me.

CASSIDY

Everybody needs a father. Trust me.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. I gotta get back in.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

You take care of yourself.

46.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

You gonna be okay?

RANDY

I'm Randy The Ram. I've taken

bigger bumps than this.

CASSIDY

I'm sure.

RANDY

Maybe I'll give my daughter a call.

CASSIDY

You should.

RANDY

Why the fuck not? I'm her father. A

person only gets one father in this

life.

CASSIDY

Exactly.

RANDY

Unless you're adopted.

CASSIDY

You're gonna be just fine.

RANDY

Definitely.

STEPHANIE

You are such an asshole.

RANDY

(taken aback)

Why?

STEPHANIE

Now you wanna fix things. Now that

suddenly you're all scared and

alone from your heart attack.

RANDY

What? No. It's not like----

STEPHANIE

This is so fuckin' you. You only

come around when you need something

from somebody, when they can do

something for you. Selfish fuck.

Good. Be alone.

RANDY

RANDY (CONT'D)

Stephanie!

CUT TO:

SCOTT BRUMBERG (O.S.)

Didn't think I'd see you here.

RANDY

Why not?

show. Sounded pretty scary.

SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)

What?

RANDY

Sold the shit outta that one.

SCOTT BRUMBERG

No way!

RANDY

I gotta give credit. DiFusco came

up with the idea. We're setting up

an angle for a grudge match.

SCOTT BRUMBERG

Wow... Dude, you are good.

SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)

I was sure I'd have to cancel the

minivan.

RANDY

What minivan?

SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)

Me and a whole gang's driving down.

CASSIDY

How'd it go with your daughter?

RANDY

(UNCONVINCING)

Good. Fine.

CASSIDY

Yeah?

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

You sure?

RANDY

Not too good, actually. She tore me

a new asshole.

CASSIDY

Shit. That sucks.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

It's tough. You can't give up. You

gotta keep trying.

RANDY

I was thinking about maybe getting

her a present.

CASSIDY

That's a great idea!

(BEAT)

What's she into?

56.

RANDY

I'm not sure.

CASSIDY

How old is she?

RANDY

22, 23?

(BEAT)

22.

CASSIDY

What kind of music does she like?

RANDY

I don't know.

CASSIDY

Is she into books? Cooking?

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

How could you not know? She's your

daughter.

RANDY

I'm a shitty fuckin' father.

CASSIDY

She's 22? Okay...

(RIFFING)

You should get her some clothes,

some kinda clothes... All girls

like that.

RANDY

That could work.

CASSIDY

I know the perfect place. This kick-

ass little vintage shop in

Westfield.

RANDY

Yeah?

CASSIDY

Saturday's the best time to go.

That's when they get the new stuff

in, all these boxes full of great

shit.

57.

RANDY

Okay. Cool.

CASSIDY

I'll write it down.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

I'm pretty sure it's on 28.

RANDY

Good tip. Thanks.

CASSIDY

You got it.

RANDY

I'm gonna grab a drink at the bar.

RANDY (CONT'D)

That was fast.

CASSIDY

Listen...

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

How `bout I meet you there

Saturday? Help you out.

RANDY

Yeah?

58.

CASSIDY

("CASUAL")

I'm actually gonna be running

around right in that area anyway,

so it's not really a pain.

RANDY

All right. Thanks.

CASSIDY

No problem. You got it.

CUT TO:

WAYNE (O.S.)

Yeah?

RANDY

Hey, Wayne. Got a sec?

WAYNE

Not really. What?

RANDY

I was wondering if you had

something more steady. Full-time.

WAYNE

Only thing I got right now's got

weekends.

RANDY

That works.

WAYNE

Isn't that when you sit on other

dudes' faces?

RANDY

What is it?

59.

WAYNE

Deli counter.

RANDY

So, like, working with customers?

WAYNE

All day long, hot horny housewives

begging for your meat.

(BEAT)

And prepared salads.

RANDY

That's the only thing you got?

WAYNE

At the moment. You interested?

CASSIDY (O.S.)

Hey.

RANDY

Hey.

RANDY (CONT'D)

I almost didn't recognize you. You

CASSIDY

"Clean"?

RANDY

Like classy.

60.

CASSIDY

Gee, thanks.

RANDY

Nah, nah, I don't mean that bad. I

like it.

(BEAT)

It's like in "Grease", where she

turns into the hot rock `n' roll

chick at the end. Except backwards.

CASSIDY

Oh-kaay...

RANDY

So, uh... Should I call you Cassidy

or Pam?

CASSIDY

Pam.

(playful finger wag)

But don't get used to it.

RANDY

This is awesome...

(rubs hands together,

PSYCHED)

We are gonna find something great!

CASSIDY

Do you know her size?

RANDY

She's kinda skinny, a little

shorter than you.

61.

CASSIDY

Could you see her in this?

RANDY

Maybe.

(BEAT)

Not really.

(BEAT)

I'm not sure.

CASSIDY

What about this?

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

So like, what is she? Goth? Punk?

Hippie?

(BEAT)

Preppy? Stoner?

RANDY

Not really...

RANDY (CONT'D)

Hey, Pam?

CASSIDY

Yeah?

RANDY

Thank you very much.

CASSIDY

You're welcome.

RANDY

I think she might be a lesbian.

62.

RANDY (CONT'D)

Does that help?

RANDY

Ah, maybe she's just a friend.

RANDY (CONT'D)

What's that?

(POINTING)

CASSIDY

Okay, I'll give you that.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

Man, I worked up a pretty good

thirst in there. What say we grab a

CASSIDY

I gotta get going.

RANDY

One beer! We gotta re-hydrate!

CASSIDY

I really can't.

(BEAT)

I got a kid at home.

RANDY

You have a kid?

RANDY (CONT'D)

RANDY (CONT'D)

Boy or girl?

CASSIDY

Boy. Daniel.

RANDY

How old?

64.

CASSIDY

Nine.

RANDY

Wow... I had no friggin' idea.

CASSIDY

It's not something I usually tell

customers. Not exactly a turn-on.

RANDY

Wait.

RANDY (CONT'D)

Now both our kids got something.

RANDY (CONT'D)

You're gonna turn this down, too?

Man, you're rough!

CASSIDY

That's very nice of you. Thank you.

RANDY

Tell him to take good care of that.

RANDY

Nah.

CASSIDY

RANDY

He's a good-lookin' kid.

CASSIDY

douchebag father.

RANDY

CASSIDY

The Monster Motel...

RANDY (CONT'D)

get so scared, you'd cry. Then

you'd beg to go in again.

STEPHANIE

(chuckles to self)

Always was a glutton for

punishment.

RANDY

You'd hop on my foot and wrap your

arms around my leg. I'd have to

walk you the whole way through like

that.

STEPHANIE

I totally don't remember.

RANDY

(looks at her sweetly)

I do.

76.

RANDY

I accept your apology.

RANDY (CONT'D)

Not like that. I just mean... You

made amends. I free you.

RANDY (CONT'D)

Anything you've ever done or said

or thought, I forgive. You've done

nothing wrong to me. And anything

I've ever done...

(BEAT)

I'm sorry. Truly.

STEPHANIE

Thank you.

RANDY

I was young. My career was booming.

All those lights, the fans, the

crazy shit on the road... I wasn't

thinking about my kid. Or my wife.

RANDY (CONT'D)

My priorities were all fucked up. I

know that. But now... I wanna try

to make things right. I wanna try

to get to know you.

(lump in throat)

I just hope it's not too late.

77.

RANDY

Hope that wasn't too painful.

STEPHANIE

It was okay.

RANDY

RANDY

What if I do?

CASSIDY

I can't go there.

RANDY

What about the other day?

CASSIDY

CASSIDY

We didn't.

RANDY

What if we did?

CASSIDY

RANDY (CONT'D)

What? Am I a customer or not?

CASSIDY

Stop it.

RANDY

What's the matter?

Not in the mood?

So fake it. I'm just a stupid

customer.

CASSIDY

Stop.

I'm sure it seems retarded, but I

gotta keep that line. It's how I've

been able to live with myself the

last 12 years.

CASSIDY

There's a place I'm trying to get

to in my life. For me and my son.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

I'm leaving that world behind. And

I can't bring anybody with me who----

102.

RANDY

(doesn't really care)

Good for you. Quitting's hard.

CASSIDY

Where are you going?

RANDY

Got a match.

RANDY (CONT'D)

See ya later.

CASSIDY

In bed by 11. Don't let him

bargain.

CASSIDY

Bye, monkey...

103.

CLUB D.J. (O.S.)

Cassidy----where ya goin', baby?

CLUB D.J. (O.S.)

Pam.

CASSIDY

(to self)

Pam.

104.

STEPHANIE'S VOICE

This is Stephanie, you know what to

do.

(answering machine BEEP)

RANDY

It's me. I promise I won't call you

ever again.

(BEAT)

I'm going back to the ring. You

were right about me. Everything you

said. Anyway... I just wanted you

to know...

(BEAT)

Your daddy loves you.

(BEAT)

That's all.

CASSIDY

There's waffles in the freezer and

some burritos if he wants for

lunch. He knows where.

(BEAT)

I'm not sure what time I'll be

headed back yet. I'll keep you

posted as I go.

105.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Yeah, nah, business is rockin'.

Just opened a third dealership.

THE AYATOLLAH

That makes two in Columbus, one in

Dayton. Next 12 months, I'd say

Cincy's not out of the question.

OTHER WRESTLER

(not too interested)

Wow...

THE AYATOLLAH

Ram-A-Lam.

RANDY

(shakes Ayatollah's hand)

What's up, Bob?

(shakes other guy's hand)

Yo, Carl.

THE AYATOLLAH

Good to see ya, bro. Didn't think

we were gonna do this.

RANDY

Yeah, well, I'm here.

THE AYATOLLAH

Thursday night, I get a call, "It's

on! He's back in!" I'm like "What?"

106.

RANDY

When you get settled in, we should

go over things.

THE AYATOLLAH

What things?

RANDY

Y'know, the spots.

THE AYATOLLAH

Ah, we can just wing it.

RANDY

You don't wanna hash it out?

THE AYATOLLAH

It'll be fine.

RANDY

We should have at least a basic

plan.

THE AYATOLLAH

How's this: I'm the heel, you're

the face. Done.

THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.) (CONT'D)

(to other wrestler)

Anyway, if you're ever in Ohio,

swing on by. I'll make you a nice

deal on a G6.

CASSIDY

Excuse me.

CASSIDY (CONT'D)

Do you know where the Civic

Auditorium is?

107.

RANDY

Ready to do this?

THE AYATOLLAH

Believe so.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

(through curtain)

From the Islamic Republic of Iran,

weighing in at 252 pounds... The

Tehran Terror, the Beast Of The

Middle East...

(BEAT)

The Ayaaa-tooo-laaaaaah!

108.

CASSIDY

Excuse me.

THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.)

(faint, amidst the boos)

Death to America!

CASSIDY (O.S.)

Randy.

RANDY

What are you doing here?

CASSIDY

Don't do this. This is dumb.

RANDY

This ain't the best time to talk.

RANDY (CONT'D)

What about your heart?

RANDY (CONT'D)

I'll be fine.

CASSIDY

I thought the doctor...

RANDY

They always say that. Whatever you

got.

CASSIDY

You could really hurt yourself.

109.

RANDY

I know what I'm doing in there.

(turns vaguely sad)

Out here's where I get hurt.

CASSIDY

Out here's what counts. The real

world.

RANDY

Fuck the real world. Nobody gives a

shit about me in the real world.

CASSIDY

I quit my job, drove 14 hours

through the night to get here. What

do you call that?

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

(from auditorium)

And his opponent...

RANDY

(points to curtain)

Listen to them! This is where I'm

great. This is where I belong.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

From Elizabeth, New Jersey,

weighing in at 219 pounds...

RANDY

I gotta go.

CASSIDY

Randy. Please.

RANDY

I'll see you after the show.

CASSIDY

(grabs him)

No.

110.

RANDY

Enjoy the show.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

A true wrestling immortal, one of

the greatest of all time...

(BEAT)

Randy "The Ram" Robinnnnsonnnnn!

COMMENTATOR #1

There he is, folks! Randy The Ram!

COMMENTATOR #2

History about to be made here at

the Greenville Civic Auditorium.

RANDY

I just got one thing to say to you

people...

111.

RANDY (CONT'D)

Thank you.

RANDY (CONT'D)

You take your lumps and bruises in

this game. But you know what? It's

all worth it. Because of you guys.

Your cheers keep me young. They

make me feel alive.

(BEAT)

In 1982, the year I wrestled my

first professional match, I was six-

foot-one. By 1993, I was five-foot-

eleven. Three back surgeries in 11

years knocked two full inches off

my height. I may be down to five-

eleven, but performing in front of

you people has always made me feel

10 feet tall. And that's the way

it's always gonna be.

RANDY (CONT'D)

Forever.

112.

RANDY (CONT'D)

(under breath)

You're workin' pretty light here.

THE AYATOLLAH

Jesus. Relax.

REFEREE

One!... Two!...

RANDY

Anytime you wanna join in.

THE AYATOLLAH

That better?

RANDY

Much.

113.

THE AYATOLLAH

Forgot how much fun this is.

REFEREE

One!... Two!...

FAN #1 (O.S.)                      FAN #2 (O.S.)

THE AYATOLLAH

Pathetic.

("spits" on Randy)

Pitiful godless infidel!

114.

CASSIDY

Randy!

THE AYATOLLAH

(under breath)

Wanna take it home?

CASSIDY

Stop it! Stop it, Randy!

RANDY

It's time.

THE AYATOLLAH

All you, bro. Lead the way.

115.

COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)

Dropkick!

And another!

(a third one)

And another!

CROWD (O.S.)

Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...

CROWD (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...

COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.)

Just listen to this crowd!

THE AYATOLLAH

CROWD (O.S.)

RANDY

Let's do this.

COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)

Lateral drop!

116.

CROWD (O.S.)

Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...

THE AYATOLLAH

Y'okay?

THE AYATOLLAH (CONT'D)

Just pin me.

CROWD (O.S.)

THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.)

Finish it. Pin me.

117.
