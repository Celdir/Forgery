FADE UP

PROF. WEST

Watch out!

2.

PROF. WEST

How deep are we?

SATNAM

8200 feet. Used to be an old copper

mine, Professor, sir.

PROF. WEST

Helmsley told me that the neutrino

count doubled during the last sun

eruptions.

SATNAM

Correct, sir. But that is not what

worries me...

SATNAM (CONT'D)

There was a new solar storm, so strong

that the physical reaction got even

more severe.

PROF. WEST

How can that be?

SATNAM

We don't know, Professor, sir.

SATNAM (CONT'D)

The neutrinos suddenly act like...

microwaves.

CUT TO:

POLITICAL AID #1

Look at Anheuser. Anyone would think he

was President. Did you hear, he wants

us to sign in and out like school boys?

ADRIAN

I still can't believe that Wilson chose

him of all people to run the White

House.

POLITICAL AID #2

Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and

the Congress.

ADRIAN

Shame he's such a pompous ass.

ANHEUSER (O.S.)

Somebody mention my name?

ADRIAN

(SHOCKED)

Yes sir... No, sir.

ANHEUSER

Which one is it?

ADRIAN

We were talking about what a great

speech you gave tonight. Well done,

sir.

ANHEUSER

It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember

that.

POLITICAL AID #2

That guy scares the shit out of me.

(CONTINUED)

4.

ADRIAN

(into the phone)

Professor West?

PROF. WEST (O.S.)

I've been trying to reach you!

PROF. WEST

Listen, Adrian. The situation is much

worse than we thought...

ADRIAN

Sir, the President needs to know this.

ANHEUSER

Helmsley, how long have you been on the

job as science advisor?

ADRIAN

Four months this week.

ANHEUSER

I would   say that's enough time to learn

that we   have rules here. You'll just

have to   wait until the quarterly

science   briefing.

ADRIAN

If this is about what I said last

night, I am truly sorry, sir.

ANHEUSER

So you didn't like my speech?

ADRIAN

Can you please have a look at this,

sir? It's really important.

(CONTINUED)

5.

ANHEUSER

Who wrote this?

ADRIAN

An Indian astrophysicist I graduated

with from Harvard and Prof. West, the

preeminent geologist in the US.

ANHEUSER

Who else knows about it?

ADRIAN

No one, sir.

ANHEUSER

Let's keep it that way, Helmsley.

Good Morning...

(CONTINUED)

PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)

I hereby present a motion to meet

privately with my seven fellow Heads of

State, kindly excluding the rest of the

delegates.

RUSSIAN INTERPRETER

Mr. Makarenko wishes to have his

interpreters present.

PRESIDENT WILSON

Mr. President, judging from the

conversations we've had in the past, I

can assure you, your English is

absolutely fine, for what I have to

say.

PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)

Six months ago I was made aware of a

situation so devastating, that at

first, I refused to believe it.

(PAUSE)

However through the concerted efforts

of the brightest scientists of several

nations, we have now confirmed its

validity.

PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)

The world as we know it, will soon come

to an end.

CUT TO:

VOICE (O.S.)

(in Chinese)

You will have new houses, electricity

and running water...

VOICE (O.S.)

chance to work for the glorious

People's Republic of China building the

biggest dam project in the world...

LIN

I will send you money mother.

MI-6 OFFICER (O.S.)

Has his Highness had the opportunity to

study the dossier?

SAUDI PRINCE

You must understand I have a very big

family. Mister...

MI-6 OFFICER

Isaacs.

SAUDI PRINCE

Mister Isaacs, one billion dollars is a

lot of money.

MI-6 OFFICER

I'm afraid the amount is in Euros, your

Highness.

CUT TO:

MANFRED PICARD

Laura, I'm putting a lot of trust in

your people.

(CONTINUED)

9.

LAURA

There are too many crazy people who

could hurt her, Manfred. The World

Heritage Foundation has done this all

over the world.

MANFRED PICARD

And she'll be safe now? Tucked away in

the Swiss Alps?

LAURA

Perfectly safe.

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

... The mass suicide was discovered by

a BBC documentary crew in the ancient

Mayan city of Tikal...

NEWSCASTER (CONT'D)

... the victims were said to have

adhered to the Mayan-Quiche Calender

which predicts the end of time to occur

on the 21st of December this year, due

to the sun's destructive forces...

10.

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

... Strangely enough, scientific

records do support the fact that we are

heading for the biggest solar climax in

recorded history...

JACKSON

Oh no. Not again.

JACKSON (CONT'D)

Hello?... What do you mean? I'm not

late. It's not even 10:30...

JACKSON (CONT'D)

Damn it!

(into the phone)

Kate, I'm on my way... For god's

sake...

JACKSON

They're kids, Kate, going on vacation.

It's not a doctor's appointment... it's

supposed to be fun. You remember that,

right? Fun?

11.

JACKSON

... I know it's mosquito season at

Yellowstone, Kate. I'll pick some up on

the way.

NEIGHBOR

Merrill, we should move back to

Wisconsin.

RADIO HOST (O.S.)

... Those shake-proof coffee mugs are a

genius idea, and they just show the

true nature of us Californians.

RADIO HOST (O.S.) (CONT'D)

We'll not bow to little inconveniences

like these so called `mini-quakes'...

RADIO HOST (O.S.)

... If you have a funny `mini-quake'

story you wanna share, call Lisa &

Randy at 1-800...

NOAH

Jackson, what is this?

(CONTINUED)

12.

JACKSON

Don't call me Jackson, Noah, I'm your

father.

LILLY (O.S.)

Noah! Look! Daddy's got Space-Busters

in the car... and Space-Busters 2.

Awesome!

KATE

So what, you're a chauffeur now? What

happened to the temp work?

JACKSON

This is better hours for me. Means I

can still write.

KATE

Of course.

GORDON

(on the phone)

Simone, how many times have I told you,

we don't do Lipo on Fridays. It's too

messy.

GORDON (CONT'D)

Have fun guys. And watch out for those

bears.

(to Jackson)

Nice car.

KATE

Noah needs to read twenty pages from

his book each day...

KATE (CONT'D)

... and Lilly has to put these on,

before she goes to sleep.

JACKSON

Still?

(CONTINUED)

13.

KATE

Jackson, they've been really looking

forward to this you know. Don't let

them down.

CUT TO:

HARRY

So this time we'll hit the Japs.

TONY

So what?

HARRY

Well Tony, electronics are cheap there

and... you could visit your boy Will.

TONY

Afternoon ladies...

HARRY

Are you even listening to me?

TONY

Yes unfortunately I am Harry.

HARRY

I heard from Audrey you're a grandpa

now.

TONY

Why don't you keep your nose out of my

family. You're cramping my style.

HARRY

He married a Japanese girl - how is

that the end of the world? You should

at least go see him.

(CONTINUED)

14.

TONY

Why? Do you see your boy?

HARRY

Not as much as I'd like. DC is a long

way. But at least we talk.

TONY

What about?

HARRY

Life, how short it is...

TONY

What the hell was that?

CUT TO:

MANFRED PICARD (O.S.)

Laura? They lied to us.

LAURA

Manfred is that you?

MANFRED PICARD

I had my suspicions. I should have said

something. They are following me.

LAURA (O.S.)

Who is?

MANFRED PICARD

They may be listening to us too. Laura

the Heritage Foundation is a sham.

(CONTINUED)

15.

LAURA (O.S.)

What?

MANFRED

The art you collected, it's not in the

Alps.

LAURA (O.S.)

Then where is it?

SMASH CUT TO:

JACKSON AND LILLY

(singing along to the

RADIO)

`We all live in a Yellow Submarine...'

RADIO HOST

... After what is going on in La-La-

land with all those surface cracks, I

told myself: Get your stupid ass to

Yellowstone. I don't want to miss all

the great fun, when it finally blows...

LILLY

What happened to the music?

JACKSON

Hang on, sweet pea, let daddy listen to

this for a moment...

RADIO HOST

... There's been government people

flying in and out all morning. And

trust me, they did not look happy...

(CONTINUED)

16.

RADIO HOST (CONT'D)

... Folks, always remember, you heard

it first from Charlie.

CUT TO:

LAURA

You have to see this.

PRESIDENT WILSON

It's alright Sally.

CNN ANCHOR

... Mr. Picard had been the director of

the French National Museums for 24

years. As fate would have it his

assassination took place in the same

Paris tunnel where Princess Diana died

in 1997.

LAURA

I just talked to him, Dad. He told me

the world Heritage Foundation is a

sham. Is that true?

LAURA (CONT'D)

You knew too? You sleep with me and you

didn't say anything?

LAURA (CONT'D)

I can't even look at you. Either of

you!

(CONTINUED)

17.

PRESIDENT WILSON

Honey, calm down.

LAURA

A man was killed! I want the truth Dad.

Right now.

CUT TO:

LILLY (O.S.)

Daddy, where are we going?

JACKSON

To a very special place, Lil'bee. It's

a lake. A place where mommy and daddy

fell in love.

(winking to Noah)

Remember the book I gave you?

NOAH

I don't want to know where you and mom

had sex. I'm not ready for that,

Jackson.

JACKSON

I'm your dad, Noah.

LILLY (O.S.)

Daddy!

JACKSON

This wasn't here before.

NOAH

Don't you see the signs?

JACKSON

It's fine guys.

(CONTINUED)

18.

JACKSON

It's gone. The whole darn lake is gone.

I swear you guys there was a lake here.

NOAH (O.S.)

Jackson!

JACKSON

It's okay, Noh'.

ADRIAN

I'll be with you in a second,

Professor.

OFFICER

... And then you climbed over a posted

fence? Just like that?

NOAH

I told you.

(CONTINUED)

19.

JACKSON

Isn't this supposed to be a National

Park? There shouldn't be fences. What

are you guys doing around here anyway?

ADRIAN (O.S.)

We're geologists...

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

I'll handle this officer. Thank you.

JACKSON

So, where did the lake go?

ADRIAN

That's what we're trying to find out.

We think this whole area has become

potentially unstable. I would advise

you to take your kids and leave, Mr...

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

... Curtis.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

Are you by any chance the Jackson

Curtis, the author of `Farewell

Atlantis'?

JACKSON

(SURPRISED)

Yeah, that's me.

ADRIAN

What a coincidence. I'm reading your

book, as we speak... first third,

around day 300, when the shuttle loses

communication with earth and drifts off

into space.

JACKSON

You're one of lucky 422 who bought it.

ADRIAN

Actually I didn't buy it. My father

gave it to me.

(CONTINUED)

20.

JACKSON

Oh, I see.

ADRIAN

Officer, can you return them to the

campgrounds, please.

(to Jackson)

Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Curtis.

LILLY

He was very nice.

JACKSON

Yes he was, Lil'bee.

CHARLIE FROST

What did the government guys tell you?

JACKSON

They think it's not such a good idea to

climb over their fences. They feel the

area is unstable.

CHARLIE FROST

Unstable! Ha-ha! They say its unstable!

That's funny...

(CONTINUED)

21.

NOAH

There are mosquitos in here. Did

anybody spray the tent?

JACKSON

We'll get some of that tomorrow. For

tonight just put your head under the

blankie.

LILLY

Daddy you said you weren't gonna work

on your book.

JACKSON

I'm not Honey, I promise. Are you

wearing your pull-ups?

JACKSON (CONT'D)

Did mommy buy you that?

NOAH

No... Gordon gave it to me for my

birthday.

JACKSON

Noah. Things like a cell phone have to

be discussed in the family.

NOAH

(BITTER)

What family?

JACKSON

Go to sleep guys.

ADRIAN

... You have to immediately inform the

President, Mr Anheuser. The readings

look much worse than I expected.

(MORE)                    (CONTINUED)

22.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

Plus Satnam's neutrino figures from

India confirm...

ANHEUSER (O.S.)

... But you guys said...

ADRIAN

We were wrong! By five or six months...

ON THE RADIO

(Charlie's voice)

... We have a listener calling in. Bill

from Cooke City, you're on the Charlie

Frost Show.

(Bill's voice)

I wanted to know, where will this all

start?

ON THE RADIO (CONT'D)

(Charlie's voice)

Well, something like this could only

originate in Hollywood, Ha-Ha! But

seriously, they've got the earth

cracking under their asses already,

Bill.

ON THE RADIO (CONT'D)

(Bill's voice)

Our family believes in the gospel of

our Lord Jesus.

(MORE)                   (CONTINUED)

23.

ON THE RADIO (CONT'D)

We have nothing to fear, Charlie.

(Charlie's voice)

Good for you Bill, good for you!

CHARLIE FROST

... This is Charlie Frost reporting

live from Yellowstone National Park,

soon to become the world's largest

active volcano.

JACKSON

Hi. Mind if I join you?

CHARLIE FROST

I only got a few minutes.

JACKSON

I just heard part of your broadcast...

Mind me asking a question? What exactly

is it... that will start in Hollywood?

CHARLIE FROST

(CHEWING)

Actually it's gonna be the whole west

coast...

JACKSON

What are you talking about?

CHARLIE FROST

The apocalypse, the end of days. The

Mayans knew it, the I Ching and the

Bible, kind of...

CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)

I got to eat... Just check my blog. You

can download it for free.

CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)

... However, we do take donations.

(CONTINUED)

24.

CHARLIE'S VOICE

In the year 2012 a cataclysmic event

will unfold. Caused by an alignment of

the planets in our solar system that

only happens every 640,000 years...

Just imagine the earth as an Orange...

CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

... our sun will begin to emit such

extreme amounts of radiation, that the

core of the earth will melt - that's

the inside part of the Orange, leaving

the crust of our planet free to shift.

CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

In 1958, Prof. Hapgood named it `Earth

Crust Displacement'...

CHARLIE FROST

... and Albert Einstein endorsed it...

CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)

The forces of mother nature will be so

devastating it will bring an end to

this world on winter solstice 12-21-12.

CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)

Pretty neat, huh? It's a big hit on

YouTube. I did the animation myself.

(PAUSE)

I know what you're thinking. But all

the governments know about this.

JACKSON

If they all knew, don't you think

somebody would tell us?

(CONTINUED)

25.

CHARLIE FROST

They can't. Just think about it. First

the stockmarket would crash...

CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)

Then the economy... boom. The dollar...

boom. And then the people in the

streets...

(mimicking gun fire)

Boom, boom! Pandemonium, revolution,

war! They would never tell us. Beer?

CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)

Only if you're some Sheik, Bill Gates,

or maybe one of those Russian

billionaires do you stand a chance to

buy a seat.

JACKSON

A seat?

CHARLIE FROST

(INTENSELY)

They're building spaceships, man.

JACKSON

Oh... I see.

CHARLIE FROST

No really... One of my listeners, a

geography professor at UTSC, has even

figured out where they're building

them. He sent me a map.

JACKSON

Well... Charlie, I think I gotta go. My

kids are sleeping.

CHARLIE FROST

Get them out of Yellowstone, man. It's

gonna get ugly here.

JACKSON

Night, Charlie.

(CONTINUED)

26.

CHARLIE FROST

Sorry for the delay, folks. But even in

times like these, a man has got to

eat...

CUT TO:

GORDON

Why don't we make a baby?

KATE

Stop it! We're in public.

GORDON

Honey, I created them. And now suddenly

I can't touch them?

GORDON (CONT'D)

You always act strange after he shows

up?

KATE

Just because I don't care for your

arrogant humor doesn't mean I'm acting

strange. He is the father of my kids.

(CONTINUED)

27.

GORDON

Maybe biologically. Can I remind you

what that guy did? First you gave up

med school to have Noah... Then you

practically raise him and Lilly by

yourself while he sat glued to a laptop

writing that junk.

KATE

Some of his stuff is actually... He's

published Gordon.

GORDON

(MOCKINGLY)

Yeah, published! You know your mother

was right. You've always been drawn to

guys with lofty dreams and empty

pockets. But not this time right,

sweetheart?

KATE

Did you see that?

GORDON

See what?

GORDON (CONT'D)

You know Kate, we have to keep working

at this... our relationship. Because I

won't end up being just a re-run of you

and Jackson.

(PAUSE)

I mean Honey, I feel like... something

is pulling us apart?

CUT TO:

28.

JACKSON

Just stop scratching. You'll get them

infected.

JACKSON (CONT'D)

Something for Mosquito bites please?

CASHIER

Before or after?

JACKSON

What?

CASHIER

I'd get before and after.

LILLY

(POINTING)

Look! Mrs. Birnbaum, my teacher is on

TV!

NOAH

That's our supermarket.

JACKSON

(WORRIED)

Kids, we have to pack up and go find

mommy.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

29.

ANHEUSER

Sir, you have to initiate the boarding

process immediately.

PRESIDENT WILSON

Is this even possible? What's our

information from China?

ANHEUSER

They estimate four of the ships will be

ready for launch.

PRESIDENT WILSON

Only four?

ANHEUSER

If it's alright with you sir, I'll

brief the panel about the new

development.

PRESIDENT WILSON

I'd rather have Adrian do that. They

trust him. I told him to be in on the

meeting.

PRESIDENT WILSON

Ladies and Gentlemen, we all knew this

day would come. But we never imagined

it would come this soon.

PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)

I would like to pass this over to my

science advisor, Adrian Helmsley.

ADRIAN

I'll make this brief...

(CONTINUED)

30.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

... According to our latest data from

Yellowstone, the temperature of the

subterranean crust of the earth, the

cement that holds our landmass in

place, is increasing at a rapid rate,

much faster than anticipated...

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

... This causes extreme polar

instability. The magnetic fields have

decreased by more than 80% over the

last 48 hours.

GERMAN CHANCELLOR

How much time do we have, Mr. Helmsley?

ADRIAN

Two, maybe three days if we're lucky.

ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER

How can you speak about luck in such a

situation?

ANHEUSER

Apologies Prime minster. He's still new

to the job.

PRESIDENT WILSON

Nevertheless, Mr. Antonioni, we have to

make an immediate decision.

not see you.

He needs to concentrate now, Mister

YURI

You shut up... when I talk to my boy,

understand?

COACH

Yes, Mr. Karpov.

YURI

Good... That is good.

(in Russian to the

BOXER)

Zultan my friend. Do not forget. We are

At least it looks like the Mosquitos

ate well.

KATE (CONT'D)

Wanna come in?

YURI (O.S.)

Where are you Curtis?

JACKSON (O.S.)

Back in Westwood, Mister Karpov.

YURI

Good. That is good. I'm sending the

Tell him to bring Caesar's raincoat,

OLEG

Careful with our stuff. Don't get it

ALEC

Curtis, can't you go faster?

JACKSON

Are you guys blind? I can't run people

over.

OLEG

Why not? They're idiots anyway.

35.

SASHA

Hey Jackson. Took you a while...

ALEC

Ouch! Be more careful!

OLEG

Now you're laughing, Curtis. But we are

going on a big ship.

We will live... and you will die.

JACKSON

GORDON

Not that we'd expect him to remember.

JACKSON

(SCREAMING)

California is going down! Pack up the

kids!

KATE

You're crazy! The Governor just said

we're fine now.

JACKSON

The Governor's a meathead, how would he

know anything? Kate listen! You gotta

LAURA

Because your daddy is a lunatic,

Yeah.

Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Let's

hear it for the one and only Tony

Delgado... And I'm Harry Helmsley and

we'll be back after a short pit stop.

ADRIAN (O.S.)

Dad... what I have to tell you is very

serious...

ADRIAN

You remember when I told you about the

dam in China? Well, it's happening much

sooner than we anticipated.

ADRIAN (O.S.)

The President has ordered us to clear

out the White House.

HARRY

Hah... About time someone cleaned up

that mess.

42.

ADRIAN

Where are you, dad? What exactly is the

course of the `Freedom' right now?...

HARRY (O.S.)

It's all good, Adrian. Don't worry

important things to do now.

HARRY

You know, your mom and I, we had a hell

of a great life... and a hell of a

great kid too.

(PAUSE)

And the `Freedom' is a pretty big ship

you know... Don't write your old man

off, just yet.

Why not? Who cares how long we do

certain things? How long we drink

booze, how long we talk to people... Or

how long we don't talk to people.

TONY

Woah!... Harry, what's the matter with

you? Let's go. We're back on.

HARRY

Call your kid, you stubborn old ass.

(PAUSE)

I'm not going back on that stage unless

you promise to call him.

WAITER

(INTERRUPTING)

Tony, the ladies are waiting for you.

HARRY

Promise me, Tony... please.

TONY

Yeah, maybe I should call him...

LILLY

Daddy wait! I wanna come with you!

KATE

Lilly! Come back!

JACKSON

It's fine! I'll take her.

CHARLIE'S VOICE

... I am standing here at the highest

point on what is the rim of this super

volcano...

JACKSON

He's got to be close by, Lil'bee...

LILLY

Let's go back, Daddy.

JACKSON

Listen to me. We have to find Charlie.

He's got a secret map, you know, like

Jack Sparrow in `Pirates'.

JACKSON (CONT'D)

Lil', we have to work as a team now,

okay? You have to help me.

CHARLIE'S VOICE

640,000 years ago...

JACKSON

Dial Mommy's number, sweetheart.

LILLY    (O.S.)

Hi mommy...

KATE

Where are you, honey!?

JACKSON

Tell her we'll be back in ten minutes.

LILLY

We're looking for a secret map, mommy.

KATE

Let me speak to your daddy, darling.

LILLY (O.S.)

Daddy can't talk right now, he's

driving really fast...

LILLY

Ouch!

KATE (O.S.)

LILLY!

CHARLIE'S VOICE

... I tell you guys, any minute now...

any minute the fireworks will start...

KATE (O.S.)

Who's in the car with you? Who's that

man screaming?

LILLY

He's not in the car. He's on a mountain

waiting for fireworks.

LILLY (CONT'D)

There he is! Up there!

JACKSON

You're the best, darling. Give Daddy

the phone...

(into the phone)

Kate I am sorry, I can't talk...

KATE (O.S.)

Bring back my child, Jackson! NOW!

JACKSON

You wait here for me! You watch the

ship while Captain Curtis talks to the

pirate. Okay?

LILLY

(UNCERTAIN)

Okay...

CHARLIE FROST

(into his mic)

... I wish you guys at home could see

this on TV...

CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)

How did you make it up here? Thought

you were toast.

JACKSON

The spaceships Charlie, where are they?

CHARLIE FROST

You can't make it there.

(CONTINUED)

48.

JACKSON

We have a plane. We can get you out of

here too. Let's go Charlie!

CHARLIE FROST

You'll never make it out in time. Just

stay and enjoy the big bang. That your

kid?

JACKSON

Where is that god damn map!

CHARLIE FROST

Easy, easy. Watch the mic... I don't

know. Somewhere in my camper.

CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)

Wow! Look at that!...

(into his mic)

Fly birdies fly! This marks the last

day of the United States of America

folks and by tomorrow...

CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)

see us from a million miles away, out

there in the milky way...

CHARLIE'S VOICE

everywhere.

Washington DC...

Jackson, things are really looking bad

here!

CHARLIE FROST

beautiful!

We have to take off!

NOAH

LILLY

Where's daddy?!

GORDON

Kate, I'm sorry but if we wait we'll

all die!

Gordon! Wait!

KATE (CONT'D)

JACKSON! NO!

LILLY

It's daddy!

KATE

Jackson! Here!

(CONTINUED)

53.

NOAH

Faster Dad. You can make it!

GORDON

Kate, grab him for god sake. We're

almost out of runway.

JACKSON

Thanks for waiting guys.

KATE

So, now that you got your map, where

are we going?

JACKSON

We're gonna need a bigger plane.

CUT TO:

ADRIAN

Just a few minutes ago Yellowstone

erupted, sir. The ash cloud will reach

Washington in roughly 7 hours. Maybe 6.

We have strong easterly winds...

ANHEUSER

And the crustal displacement?

(CONTINUED)

54.

ADRIAN

No one knows, sir.

ANHEUSER

Let's get the government airborne

and... I mean now.

ANHEUSER

Where is the President, Sally?

SALLY

He said he wanted to spend a few

minutes alone. I think he's over at the

chapel.

ANHEUSER

The whole North American continent is

about to perish, and Wilson decides to

go to church!

ADRIAN

He's praying sir. Which considering the

circumstances is not a bad idea.

ANHEUSER

Maybe. But right now I need the leader

of the free world off his knees and on

Air Force One. Wheels up 1900 hours.

Can I leave that with you Helmsley?

SALLY

I really don't like that man.

ADRIAN

Mr. President? We need to get you out

of Washington immediately.

(CONTINUED)

55.

PRESIDENT WILSON

Now matter how idealistic you are

taking office. You lose your innocence

behind that desk.

(PAUSE)

Laura was right. People have died

because of the decisions I made.

ADRIAN

That's not your fault sir.

PRESIDENT WILSON

You sound like Anheuser.

PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)

Laura's never looked at me like that

before. Only once... When I told her,

her mother had died. You knew the first

lady?

ADRIAN

A little.

PRESIDENT WILSON

You know what she said to me that night

we brought her to the hospital?

(PAUSE)

`Tommy... I think you should do a

lottery. Every one should have a chance

to go'. That's what Dorothy said to me.

That's what we should have done.

ADRIAN

There would have been chaos, sir.

PRESIDENT WILSON

You know what I believe, Adrian. I

believe nature should choose for

itself, from itself.

PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)

Don't let her go. You'll regret it if

you do. Prove to Laura what kind of a

man you are. And I'll do the same...

You go now. And watch your back for

Anheuser.

(CONTINUED)

56.

ADRIAN

But sir?

PRESIDENT WILSON

Go. That's an order Helmsley.

PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)

Would you tell my daughter... there's

nothing on earth that I cherish more

than her.

CUT TO:

GORDON

I told you we should have gone to my

parents' in the Rockies.

KATE

Gordon's right. Look at this mess.

JACKSON

You don't understand, it's our only

chance.

(CONTINUED)

57.

GORDON

This isn't one of your crazy stories

now. How the hell are we gonna make it

to China?

NOAH

Gordon, without Jackson, we'd never

have made it out of California.

YURI (O.S.)

Careful with the landing gear!

(in Russian)

Tamara, get the boys out of the way!

VOICE

(over loudspeaker)

Attention! The US National Guard has

informed us, that an extremely

hazardous ash cloud is headed towards

the city of Las Vegas.

We strongly advise every one to move

indoors immediately...

FIRE MAN

Let's move people! Inside the terminal!

CUT TO:

58.

ADRIAN

Where's Anheuser?

OFFICER

In the command center, sir.

ADRIAN

The President is not coming. I couldn't

convince him to.

ANHEUSER

So, the captain doesn't want to leave

his sinking ship?

(PAUSE)

Well, Mr. Helmsley, we just learned

that the Vice President's chopper

crashed 80 miles north of Atlanta.

ADRIAN

What about the Speaker of the House?

ANHEUSER

In this chaos... I have no idea!

ADRIAN

But she's Commander In Chief now. Sir,

I just think -

ANHEUSER

I don't care what you think, Helmsley.

(CONTINUED)

59.

ANHEUSER (CONT'D)

Your ass only made it into the White

House, because your old man knew the

First Lady... and because of all that

affirmative action bullshit.

ANHEUSER (CONT'D)

There was a white kid, much more

qualified than you. Just so you know.

LAURA (O.S.)

Where is my father?

ADRIAN

He wanted to stay with his people.

LAURA

We have to go back!

LAURA (CONT'D)

Let me get out. Mr. Anheuser - tell the

Captain.

ANHEUSER

There is a protocol for just this

situation Ms. Wilson and I'm afraid

we'll have to follow it to the letter.

ANHEUSER (CONT'D)

Tell the Captain, to take off

immediately.

She's a patient, honey.

JACKSON

(SARCASTICALLY)

Nice work.

JACKSON (CONT'D)

You bastard. You knew it all along!

(at the twins)

You and those spoiled rotten sons of

yours...

SASHA

I found us a plane, an Antonov. They

were just about to take off, but the

tower didn't let them.

YURI

Can you still fly that thing?

SASHA

Sure... But I need a copilot.

LILLY

Gordon is a pilot.

(CONTINUED)

61.

JACKSON

Let's go!

RESCUE WORKER

Hey! Stop! You can't go out there! Come

back!

NOAH

Wow, that is a big plane.

YURI

(PROUDLY)

It's Russian.

SASHA

Guys, follow me!

SASHA

(into the mic)

You'll find folding seats on each side

of the cargo hold...

SASHA (O.S.)

... Sit down and buckle up!

(CONTINUED)

62.

NOAH

Wow! Look at those!

YURI

We had VIP tickets for that.

SASHA

You check the main bus for the

hydraulics. I'll balance the tanks.

GORDON

Uh... What?

SASHA

Work the radio and keep an eye on the

fuel, okay?

RESCUE WORKER

Move back, people... down on the floor!

GORDON

We have to get going!

SASHA

(CALM)

We're going, we're going.

Ladies and gentlemen, we are on our way

CUT TO:

LAMA YAK LA

(in Chinese)

Do not believe in anything simply

because you have heard it, Neng.

NENG

But Lin is my brother. He is working

inside the big tunnels, where the ships

are made.

NENG (CONT'D)

What is in your wisdom for us to do,

great Lama... if Lin is right, if our

world is indeed coming to an end?

NENG (CONT'D)

It's full, great Lama. It can hold no

more!

LAMA YAK LA

Like this cup, Neng, you are full of

your own opinions and speculations. How

can I show you wisdom unless you first

empty your cup?

(CONTINUED)

66.

LAMA YAK LA (CONT'D)

Be careful with the clutch. It tends to

slide.

MRS. PANG

(in Chinese)

Bata! Neng is coming!

NENG

Mother, I got a message from Lin. He

wants us to meet him in Cho Ming, at

the west gate. He says he can get us on

one of the ships he is working on.

MRS. PANG

I thought Lin is working on the dam?

NENG

The dam is a ship, Mother. The

government lied to us. There will be a

big flood.

MRS. PANG

Not here in the mountains... Let's eat

first.

(CONTINUED)

67.

NENG

No mother! We must pack up right away.

NENG'S MOTHER

We took a trip with the Laem Song ferry

once. Your father was throwing up the

whole way.

MR. PANG

Neng, I did not know you were coming

for dinner.

CUT TO:

OLEG (O.S.)

Look, the new Bentley.

ALEC

Our dad had one on order. We were

supposed to get it next year.

OLEG

But then he cancelled it again, because

of the ships.

NOAH

If I was rich, I'd get one of those.

OLEG

We have one. How many cars does your

family have?

NOAH

My Mom's boyfriend has a Porsche, a

Carrera 4.

(CONTINUED)

ALEC

Our parents are divorced too.

NOAH

Nothing we can do about that.

NOAH (CONT'D)

Wow... look at this.

KATE (O.S.)

Be careful, Noh'!

TAMARA

How did you meet Dr. Silberman? He's

great, isn't he?

KATE

I think for the same reasons you did.

You know, after breast feeding two

kids...

KATE (CONT'D)

Did your husband ask you to get your's

done?

TAMARA

We are not married. And we probably

never will... But he paid for them.

KATE

I bet he did.

LILLY

What did the man pay for mommy?

KATE

Nothing, Lil'bee.

(CONTINUED)

69.

TAMARA

What's your situation?

KATE

Way too complicated...

YURI

They seem to like each other.

JACKSON

I guess... So tell me Mr. Karpov - how

much did you pay?

YURI

One billion euro, per seat.

JACKSON

That's disgusting.

YURI

You know Curtis, I wasn't always

businessman. I am a boxer. Was my only

playing when I was a boy, back in

Murmansk. My coach...

(SMILING)

... his name also Yuri... He always

said: `Someone wants to beat you... he

has to kill you first'.

YURI (CONT'D)

What would you have done, if you rich

like me? Just look at your gorgeous

kids. And call me Yuri...

SASHA (O.S.)

Hi guys. The plan is to refuel in

Hawaii. So, buckle up... Gordon and I

will do the rest.

(CONTINUED)

70.

GORDON

Let's get this straight, Sasha. I'm not

a pilot. I'm a plastic surgeon. I just

took some lessons to overcome my fear

of flying.

SASHA

Why did you give up?

GORDON

It didn't work.

GORDON (CONT'D)

What about the wheels we lost at take-

off?

SASHA

There's 14 on each side. Some of them

must still be there.

SASHA (O.S.)

Still nothing from the tower?

GORDON

Guys, you really oughta take a look at

this.

71.

YURI

What is that?

SASHA

The State of Hawaii!

YURI

Not good. That is not good.

JACKSON

How much fuel do we have?

SASHA

Not enough. We'll have to make a water

landing somewhere in the South China

Sea.

GORDON

At least we won't need our landing

gear.

YURI

What about it?

GORDON

We lost it all... in Vegas.

ADRIAN

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

Your Dad and I... we were trying to

protect you.

LAURA

(EXPLODING)

I'm a big girl Adrian. I don't need

protection. You used me. You guys had

me gallivanting around the world, as

part of your little cover-up.

ADRIAN

But you were doing a good job.

LAURA

Sure, if your name's Da Vinci or

Picasso. But if you're some young

talent in Podunk, Texas, sorry you're

not famous enough. People like you and

Anheuser and my father - you think you

can play God.

ADRIAN

You know what your father believed.

That nature will choose itself from

itself.

LAURA

That's bullshit and you know it. It's

the fittest, the richest and the

strongest that survive.

ADRIAN

That's not true.

(CONTINUED)

73.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

What would you say were the chances of

a first time, middle-aged writer, who

barely sold 500 copies of his novel

making it on board this plane?

LAURA

Zero. What's your point?

ADRIAN

It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and

it's a fantastic read. It's part of our

legacy now.

INTERCOM (O.S.)

Mr. Helmsley, Prof. West requests your

presence immediately.

ADRIAN

What if I tried to sort some of this

mess out? I need to know you can

forgive me...

LAURA

I need to know that too, Adrian.

ADRIAN

One more thing. Your father told me you

were the most precious thing to him in

the whole world... You are to me too.

OLD LADY

She can't find her mother.

Why don't you two girls make yourself

comfy on that big couch? I'll see what

I can do.

go check with the Red Cross...

OLD LADY

No wonder the First Lady fell for him.

I knew Miss Dorothy Jones long before

the President, when she was still

singing jazz down in Atlanta with Harry

Helmsley.

SALLY

I know, she was amazing.

PRESIDENT WILSON

Who can help me with missing persons?

RED CROSS VOLUNTEER

Sorry man, I'm busy right now.

RED CROSS VOLUNTEER (CONT'D)

By `people' are we talking about me?

KATE

Do you think you've changed since we

separated?

JACKSON

Well I certainly eat a lot more cereal

now...

KATE

You know, you always had tunnel vision.

You could always just block things out

Jackson.

Do you love him? Gordon...

KATE

I love him enough.

SCIENCE OFFICER #1

1.2 percent, but still moving.

ANHEUSER

Any clue what to expect next,

Professor?

PROF. WEST

Once the movement of our land masses

comes to a halt, we expect the

formation of tidal waves, sir...

proportional to the magnitude of the

corresponding quakes.

ADRIAN

Do we have any news from the Japanese

seaboard?

SCIENCE OFFICER #2

Would our science advisor care to give

us his assessment?

ADRIAN

We expect enormous tsunamis to reach

landfall in every continent. The Cho

Ming area will be impacted in

approximately six hours.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

shifted by nearly 23 degrees in a south-

westerly direction. Here's the computer

simulation.

It's the south pole, sir.

Wake up Lil'bee. We're getting ready to

I'm Captain Richard Michaels. I'm the

skipper of the American boat sir. After

you!

CAPTAIN MICHAELS

My sincerest condolences Dr. Wilson,

for your father...

CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)

Your party is the last to arrive.

ANHEUSER

I've been told of damages?

CAPTAIN MICHAELS

We haven't completed the assessment but

it looks like we lost Number 4 when the

crust shifted.

CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)

There it is!

(CONTINUED)

91.

YURI

What do mean we can't board Number 4? I

want to speak to your supervisor.

SOLDIER

I am the supervisor! Now get in line

with all the others while we make

arrangements.

YURI

I want your name!

SOLDIER

(pointing to his

BADGE)

Can you read? Now get the hell back

with the other green cards, or I'll

have you detained.

CUT TO:

JACKSON

Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart.

You're doing great.

(CONTINUED)

92.

TAMARA

I should have listened to you, Dr.

Silberman. I actually liked the way I

looked before that monster talked me

into it.

GORDON

Did you know he asked for a discount...

and he paid in installments?

TAMARA

Cheap bastard.

GORDON

You're better off without him. What he

said about you and Sasha, is it true?

TAMARA

Now that he's gone I think he was worth

a hundred times a man like Yuri.

JACKSON

You guys hear that?

JACKSON

(out of breath)

Hey! Help! Wait for us!

JACKSON (CONT'D)

Shit! Shit!

(CONTINUED)

93.

CUT TO:

LAURA

Captain Michaels? What happens to all

those people?

ANHEUSER

Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all

that. You just stick to your art. We'll

handle the rest.

ANHEUSER (CONT'D)

Captain? Where is the Bridge?

CHINESE STEWARD (O.S.)

Dr. Wilson? Your cabin is this way.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

94.

ADRIAN

Satnam?

(CONFUSED)

Where are you?

SATNAM (O.S.)

On the Nampan Plateau...

ADRIAN

What?!

SATNAM

There's a tidal wave coming from the

East! It's huge!

ADRIAN

Satnam, what happened?

SATNAM (O.S.)

We never got picked up, Adrian, the

airlift never came!

SATNAM

I have to go!

(CONTINUED)

95.

ADRIAN

Do we have the latest satellite images

of Napam, India?

SCIENCE OFFICER

One moment, sir.

ANHEUSER

Helmsley, what's going on here?

ADRIAN

Looks like our model was wrong.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

Satnam was talking about a wave from

the East.

PROF. WEST

Jesus!

ANHEUSER

What does this mean?

(CONTINUED)

96.

ADRIAN

The flooding will happen earlier.

Bobby, can you plug in the new data

please?

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

Satnam didn't get picked up.

SCIENCE OFFICER (O.S.)

Ready sir.

ADRIAN

This one is at least 1500    meters high!

ANHEUSER

Talk to me Helmsley. What does this

mean for us?

ADRIAN

Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust

the count down?

ANHEUSER

Get me the other Heads of State.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

97.

LIN

(in Chinese)

Who are they?

NENG

We found them by the side of the road,

my brother.

LIN

You must send them back.

NENG

I am a follower of the great Lama Yak

La. You know I cannot do that.

JACKSON

Come with daddy.

JACKSON (CONT'D)

At least take our children with you.

Please.

LIN

Why should I do that?

JACKSON

For the same reason you sent for your

parents.

KATE

I have no clue if you understand what

I'm saying, but I ask you as a mother,

please take my kids with you!

MRS. PANG

(in Chinese)

We are all children of this earth.

LIN

My plan will not work for so many,

mother.

(CONTINUED)

98.

MRS. PANG

We will take them all. Bata?

KATE

Thank you ma'am. Thank you so much.

CUT TO:

YURI

They're leaving without us!

SOLDIER

What did I tell you!

(CONTINUED)

99.

YURI

(POINTING)

Look! Idiot! They are leaving you

behind too!

CUT TO:

LIN

(in Chinese)

We have to hurry!

(to Jackson)

They launch! We run out of time!

COMPUTER VOICE

Countdown to departure. Launch in 17

minutes - 42 seconds.

(CONTINUED)

100.

LAURA

Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?

SCIENCE OFFICER

He's in the Technical Command Centre.

Follow me.

LIN

(in Chinese)

Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give

me your hand.

(CONTINUED)

101.

JACKSON

Move Lil'bee!

TAMARA

(POINTING)

Oh my god, that's Yuri!

TAMARA (CONT'D)

Caesar!

YURI

Let that stupid dog go!

(CONTINUED)

102.

LIN

(in Chinese)

Okay. Now!

JACKSON

Tamara! Come on! Get in!

YURI

(in Russian)

Down there! Oleg, you go first!

OLEG

Daddy look, Tamara!

TAMARA

Caesar darling!

(CONTINUED)

103.

JACKSON

Tamara! Get in!

TAMARA

Come to mommy!

LIN

I need your help.

LAURA

What in god's name is happening Adrian?

ADRIAN

Anheuser convinced them all to launch.

ADRIAN

Anheuser! We have to stop this madness.

(CONTINUED)

104.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

Bobby, make sure the other bridges can

hear this.

ANHEUSER

What do you think you're doing?

ADRIAN

I know exactly what I'm doing.

(To Bobby)

Turn it on!

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

This is Adrian Helmsley, science

advisor to President Wilson...

GERMAN CHANCELLOR

Can you please turn up the volume, Mr.

Hoffmann?

ADRIAN (O.S.)

I know we've all been involved in

making difficult decisions... to save

our human civilization...

ADRIAN

... But to be human means to care for

each other, and civilization means to

work together to create a better life.

If that's true there is nothing human

and nothing civilized about what we're

doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we

really stand by and let all those

people out there die?

(CONTINUED)

105.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

A civilization that allows that, does

not deserve to survive.

(PAUSE)

Or at least I don't want to be part of

it.

ANHEUSER

We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow

we'll get by. Officer switch that off.

ANHEUSER (CONT'D)

That's an order soldier.

ADRIAN

Don't do it!

ADRIAN (O.S.)

We have to open our gates and let these

people in. All of them.

ANHEUSER

Have you lost your mind? Look at the

countdown. We have less than five

minutes left... And none of our ships

have the resources to feed those

people. If you save them today we all

starve tomorrow.

ANHEUSER (CONT'D)

Do you wanna be responsible for the

extinction of the human race? Can you

handle that, Adrian?!

(CONTINUED)

106.

ADRIAN

There is a young astrophysicist from

India who is the reason we are all

here, trying to give mankind a second

chance. He's the one who discovered it

all, the one who connected the dots. We

all owe him our lives.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

I just learned that he was killed with

his family by a tsunami in eastern

India. You know why?

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

He died because we forgot to pick him

up.

(PAUSE)

I beg you... whatever our future holds

don't let us start it with an act of

cruelty. What will you tell your

children... and their children?

LAURA

If my father were here, he would open

the gates.

RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (O.S.)

The people of Russia along with...

RUSSIAN PRESIDENT

... China and Japan agree to open the

gates.

GERMAN CHANCELLOR

The United Kingdom, Spain, France and

Germany, and I believe I can also speak

for the Italian Prime Minister...

107.

GERMAN CHANCELLOR (O.S.)

... We vote to open the gates.

ADRIAN

Captain Michaels, you heard them.

LILLY

Phew... It stinks in here.

TAMARA

Sssh...Caesar.

LIN

They're opening the gate! It will crush

us!

(CONTINUED)

108.

JACKSON

Noah! Watch out!

KATE

No!

NOAH

Something happened, mom.

JACKSON

We have to stop it!

109.

JACKSON

You did it, man. You did it.

CAPTAIN MICHAELS

What's wrong with the gate?

OFFICER

I don't know. Maybe there's something

jamming it, sir.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

110.

CUT TO:

SURVEILLANCE OFFICER

Sir, we have a breach in the zoological

bay.

ADRIAN

Can you zoom in?

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

I know those kids. Remember the book I

told you about? Their father wrote it.

CAPTAIN MICHAELS

We're loaded. We can close the gates

sir.

ANHEUSER

Do it!

YURI

(in Russian)

Pull yourself up!

(CONTINUED)

111.

DECK OFFICER (O.S.)

To the lower decks people!

YURI

Oleg! Catch your brother!

DECK OFFICER

Boys, you gotta move.

ALEC

We wait for our father! He's still down

there!

DECK OFFICER

There's no one down there.

(GENTLE)

Come on boys, come...

ANHEUSER

Why is the stern gate not closing?

(CONTINUED)

112.

CAPTAIN MICHAELS

Something's wrong with the hydraulics,

sir.

ADRIAN (O.S.)

Captain, over here.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

I think we found the problem.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

How did they get in there?

SURVEILLANCE OFFICER

They must have come through the

hydraulic chamber. There...

LAURA

That guy is injured. Something must

have gone wrong.

ANHEUSER

You're damn right something went wrong!

Congratulations Helmsley, you may have

just killed us all but as long as your

conscience is clean...

ADRIAN

Let's get an emergency crew there right

now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic

Chamber.

ANHEUSER

You think you're the main man now, just

because your fucking the President's

daughter?

(CONTINUED)

113.

ADRIAN

What are you all waiting for?

CUT TO:

TECHNICAL OFFICER

If we can't close the stern gate, then

the engines won't start.

ADRIAN

There's no way to override it?

TECHNICAL OFFICER

No sir, it has to be done manually.

NENG

(in Chinese)

Almost there, Lin...

CUT TO:

114.

SURVEILLANCE OFFICER

Water has penetrated the stern!

LAURA

What now?

SURVEILLANCE OFFICER

The rear of the ship will start sealing

itself up one compartment at a time.

ADRIAN

Then how will we get to the hydraulic

chamber?

SURVEILLANCE OFFICER

If we don't hurry, we won't be able to.

(CONTINUED)

115.

KATE

Tamara! Take Lilly and Noah.

KATE (CONT'D)

I was so worried about you.

LILLY

Mummy!

TAMARA

Lilly run!

TAMARA (O.S) (CONT'D)

Lilly! Take him.

(CONTINUED)

116.

ADRIAN

Is there any way to talk to them?

JACKSON

We have to move him higher.

(looks around)

Over there!

117.

NAVAL OFFICER

Moving at 34 knots, sir.

CAPTAIN MICHAELS

What is our position?

NAVIGATION OFFICER

Darjeeling valley, heading south east,

sir.

CAPTAIN MICHAELS

You must be kidding!

KATE

We need something to stop the bleeding

or he'll die.

NOAH

Mum, will this do?

ADRIAN

(Over a speaker)

Mr. Curtis... I'm Adrian Helmsley. We

met once before. Your daughter is with

me.

(CONTINUED)

118.

KATE

Lilly!

LILLY

I'm alright Mom!

ADRIAN (O.S.)

We can't get to you. Whatever you did,

jammed the hydraulics. If you can't get

it out... None of us will make it.

ADRIAN

You're our only hope.

JACKSON

I'll go back. I'll try my best.

NOAH

I'll go with you.

JACKSON

You stay with Mommy.

(CONTINUED)

119.

JACKSON (CONT'D)

I'll be right back...

ANHEUSER

Captain, what's happening?

CAPTAIN MICHAELS

What's happening?...

(PAUSES)

We're heading straight for the north

face of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser.

120.

KATE

Noah!

121.

NOAH

Mom, we did it!

NOAH (O.S.)

We got it free. Can you hear me? We did

it!

ADRIAN

Captain Michaels - close the gate!

CAPTAIN MICHAELS

That's affirmative. Close the gate!

TECHNICAL OFFICER

Ay, ay, Sir.

122.

CAPTAIN MICHAELS

Engage starboard stabilizers!

OFFICERS

One is engaged... two is engaged...

number three is out, sir!

KATE

Noah! Where is he?

NOAH

He was just behind me...

(CONTINUED)

123.

JACKSON

If you would ever consider to give me

another chance... I promise, I'll

always be there when you need me.

KATE

Whatever you do... I will never let you

go again.

FADE TO BLACK

2013

ADRIAN (O.S.)

... Day 988. No one is waiting for

anything to happen...

FADE UP

ADRIAN

...   and all we can hear is the sound of

our   own breathing that reminds us we

are   still sharing our memories, hopes

and   ideas.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

... And funny, just today we found out

that the entire crew of the Atlantis,

somehow or another, has relatives in

Wisconsin.

(PAUSE)

The end.

LAURA

How many copies did you say that sold?

(CONTINUED)

124.

ADRIAN

Less than 500.

(with a smile)

It's what you might call a cult

classic.

LAURA

It seems we have very different tastes

Mr. Helmsley?

ADRIAN

(PLAYFUL)

Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson.

Something we could maybe explore...

unless you have other pressing

engagements.

LAURA

Actually my diary's pretty open.

OFFICER (O.S.)

(over loudspeaker)

Mr. Helmsley to the bridge please.

CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.)

Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain

Michaels speaking. In a few minutes, I

will be giving the orders to unseal the

decks.

CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.)

Please be careful when you step out and

of course... enjoy the fresh air.

LILLY

Daddy? When can we go back home?

(CONTINUED)

125.

JACKSON

There's nothing we can go back to

Lil'bee. Whatever's out there, that's

our home now. Don't be scared.

LILLY

I'm not Daddy. No more pull-ups.

JACKSON

(PROUDLY)

That's my big girl.

OLEG (O.S.)

Can we pet him?

LILLY

Of course you can. He's your doggie.

ADRIAN

You called for me, sir?

CAPTAIN MICHAELS

Prof. West has something to show you,

Mr. Helmsley.

CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)

Looks like your scientific projections

are way off again.

PROF. WEST

The water is receding much faster than

we projected, Adrian...

LAURA

What's that?

(CONTINUED)

126.

PROF. WEST

It's hard to believe, but the Himalayas

are no longer the roof of the world.

It's now the Drakensberg mountains of

Kwa-Zulu Natal. The whole African

continent has risen several thousand

feet and most likely, never even

flooded.

CAPTAIN MICHAELS

Our European colleagues have already

set course for it.

CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)

Here, somebody wants to talk to you.

ADRIAN

This is Helmsley.

VOICE

No, this is Helmsley.

ADRIAN (O.S.)

Dad!... Is that you?

CAPTAIN MICHAELS

We should have a visual of the `Freedom

of the Seas' shortly.

ADRIAN

Dad. We're coming to pick you guys up.

How's Tony?

HARRY HELMSLEY

He's fine, son. We're all fine.

(CONTINUED)

127.

ADRIAN (O.S.)

See you guys soon. Bye dad.

ANHEUSER (O.S.)

Put that woman down Helmsley.

ANHEUSER (CONT'D)

Young guys like you with your

idealistic dreams, you think you can

change the world...

ANHEUSER (CONT'D)

I just pray to God, that you keep on

making the right calls... in this new

world of ours.

ANHEUSER (CONT'D)

Mr. Helmsley, one more thing.

ANHEUSER (CONT'D)

There was no one.

ADRIAN

Pardon me?

ANHEUSER

There was no white kid better than you.

I'm terribly sorry I said that.

CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.)

This is your Captain speaking. Standby

to open Deck 1.

OFFICER

Standing by Sir.

(CONTINUED)

128.

MRS. PANG

(in Chinese)

I wonder will the clouds look the same

and the stars?

MR.PANG

Do not fear. Some things will never

change.

JACKSON

I thought you might want this.

NOAH

Do you think I'll still get a signal

... Dad?

ADRIAN

I finally finished your book Jackson.

KATE

Really? You may well be the first

person who ever got to the end.

JACKSON

Excuse me, I believe he's addressing

the author. Well, what did you think?

ADRIAN

I'd say... those astronauts of yours

would be shitting themselves, if they

knew all their relatives are now stuck

in the South Pole.

(CONTINUED)

129.
