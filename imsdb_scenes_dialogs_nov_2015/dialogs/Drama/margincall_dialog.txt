INT. LARGE INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY

1                                                                    1

The frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN, a 27-

year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT

and is staring intently into a large bank of computer

screens.

An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come

out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down

a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of

the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into

frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and

several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling

thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy

sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his

early twenties.

SETH

Is that them?

PETER

(nods yes)

SETH

Jesus Christ.

The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large

glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as

almost every person on the floor watches.

SETH (cont'd)

Are they going to do it right there?

PETER

Yeah.

SETH

Fuck me.

WILL EMERSON, sitting next to them, leans back in his chair.

WILL EMERSON

(whispered)

Have you guys ever seen this before?

SETH

No.

WILL EMERSON

Best to just ignore it. Keep your head

down and get back to work... and don't

watch.

The HR people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a

piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person

and asking their name. It is brutal. The camera follows one

HR woman, HEATHER, with her piece of paper down the hall and

into a row of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS

then stops a bit down from them.

HEATHER

Timothy Singh?

TIMOTHY

Yes.

HEATHER

I'm afraid we have to speak with you.

TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with

the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP

MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost

back into the numbers on his computer screen.

The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing

people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer

screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until

finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and

stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off

his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked.

HEATHER (cont'd)

Eric Dale?

PETER

Excuse me?

HEATHER

Eric Dale?

PETER

No.

HEATHER

Sorry?

PETER

I'm not Eric Dale.

HEATHER

Oh. I'm so sorry.

PETER

He's my boss, he's down that hall.

HEATHER

Mr. Dale?

ERIC

Yes.

HEATHER

This way.

LAUREN BRATBERG

Well... Mr. Dale I'm obviously sorry that

we are here today but these are extra

ordinary times as you very well must

know.

ERIC

I run risk management... it just doesn't

seem like a natural place to start

cutting.

HEATHER

I hope you understand that this is in no

way personal. A majority of this floor is

being let go today.

ERIC

OK

HEATHER

Mr. Dale. Ms. Bratberg is now going to

run through the details of what the firm

is offering.

ERIC

OK

LAUREN BRATBERG slides across the table a very thick

severance contract agreement.

LAUREN BRATBERG

Mr. Dale the firm is offering you six

months severance at half your salary. You

will keep all unvested options that you

currently hold. Health will be extended

through that period. You have till

tomorrow at...

She looks at her watch.

LAUREN BRATBERG (cont'd)

4:47 to either take the offer or it will

be revoked. Do you understand?

ERIC

Yes.

LAUREN BRATBERG

Now, unfortunately Mr. Dale due to the

highly sensitive nature of your work here

the firm has to take certain precautions

for security purposes that may seem

punitive in nature. I hope considering

your...

SHE looks down at the piece of paper in front of her to fact

check.

LAUREN BRATBERG (cont'd)

...over 19 years of service to the firm,

you will understand that these measures

are in no way a reflection of the firms'

feelings towards your performance or your

character.

ERIC

I'm sorry??

HEATHER

She's apologizing for what's about to

happen.

LAUREN BRATBERG

Your company email, access to the server,

access to the building, and your mobile

data and phone service will all be

severed as of this meeting. This

gentleman...

She points behind him and a smallish benign looking SECURITY

GUARD is standing in the doorway.

LAUREN BRATBERG (cont'd)

will take you to your office so that you

can clear out your personal belongings.

ERIC

What about my current ongoing work? I'm

right in the...

LAUREN BRATBERG

The firm has worked out its transition

plan and is prepared to move forward, but

we appreciate your concern.

HEATHER

We understand that this is very difficult

and here is my card. Please contact me

over the next few weeks if there is

anything that I can do to help you

through this transition in your life.

They all stare at each other in silence for several long

awkward beats.

SECURITY GUARD

Sir?

ERIC finally stands up and walks out with the guard and back

over to his office.

ERIC walks into the office and sits at his desk and begins to

clear his things out into a file box. The guard stands at the

door. Eventually ERIC'S sympathetic yet still energetic

immediate superior, WILL EMERSON comes to the door.

WILL EMERSON

Hey.

ERIC

Will.

WILL EMERSON

I'm very sorry.

ERIC

Are you still alive?

WILL EMERSON

For now.

ERIC

Congratulations.

WILL EMERSON

It's a total bloodbath.

ERIC

I heard.

WILL EMERSON

If there was anything I coulda done, you

know I woulda done it.

ERIC

I know.

WILL EMERSON

Well...

ERIC

One more thing... Who was it?

WILL EMERSON

Eric...

ERIC

Was it Rogers?

WILL EMERSON

You know me. I'm not gonna say...

ERIC

Robertson?

WILL EMERSON just looks back at him in silence.

ERIC (cont'd)

That cunt. I knew it. I never should have

gone to her last year.

WILL EMERSON

Look it wasn't anyone. It's just bad

luck. Right....?

ERIC

Yeah.

WILL EMERSON

Good luck.

They look at each other with respect but do not shake hands

as WILL EMERSON starts to leave the office.

ERIC

Will?

WILL EMERSON

Yeah.

ERIC

You know I was just in the middle of a

bunch of shit here that someone should

really take a look at.

WILL EMERSON

Eric, they are telling us that everyone

has got to get out of here and leave

everything behind. While we appreciate

your concern, this is not your problem

anymore. Alright? Good luck.

ERIC looks straight ahead as WILL leaves the office. He packs

up the last of his things, which does not take long, then

stands and gets ready to walk out. He looks around and heads

out into the cubicle area.

Outside his office PETER and SETH are standing to say

goodbye.

PETER

Eric, I am very sorry.

SETH

Yeah. Did they say what was going to

happen with us?

PETER

Jesus Seth.

SETH

What?

ERIC

No, it will be ugly around here for a

while but you guys will be fine...

SETH

Well, take care, Eric.

Seth exits.

ERIC

Well, I'll be seeing you around.

walks out behind him.

THEY both stand there in silence waiting for the elevator,

then.

PETER

I just wanted to say thank you.

ERIC

That's not necessary.

PETER

Well it is... You were the person around

here that I...

ERIC looks at him and understands. PETER turns around and

begins to walk back toward his desk.

ERIC

I know.

PETER turns back and ERIC reaches into one of his boxes and

takes out a small key chain portable hard drive and hands it

to PETER.

ERIC (cont'd)

I was close to something here... But they

wouldn't let me finish it. Take a look.

The elevator doors open and ERIC gets into the elevator. Just

as the doors are closing he says...

ERIC (cont'd)

Be careful.

The doors close.

FADE TO BLACK.

SAM ROGERS, a 57 year old executive, is sitting behind his

desk looking out the window. WILL EMERSON gently knocks on

the door, enters then sits on the couch.

WILL EMERSON

Well, that was fucking hideous.

SAM ROGERS

It's gonna get worse before it gets

better.

WILL EMERSON

Really?

SAM ROGERS

Much.

WILL EMERSON

Got any nicorettes? I'm out of

nicorettes, which means I'm gonna kill

someone in about 10 minutes... You

alright?

SAM ROGERS

My dog is dying.

WILL EMERSON

I'm sorry?

SAM ROGERS

Just spoke to the vet, it's some fucking

tumor on her liver. I'm paying almost a

thousand bucks a day to keep her alive.

WILL EMERSON

Really?

SAM ROGERS

Yeah... and I don't have a clue what to

do about it.

They both sit in silence and look out the window.

WILL EMERSON

Well they're all gone.

SAM ROGERS

How many do we have left?

WILL EMERSON

Thirty-three.

SAM ROGERS

Make sure everyone is out there, I need

to say something.

WILL EMERSON

They are ready for you.

WILL leaves SAM in his office. SAM looks as if he may not

move, then snaps out of it.

INT. TRADING FLOOR

SAM ROGERS walks out of his office and stands in front of the

trading floor that just an hour before had seated 130 people.

Now just thirty-three are scattered throughout the vast

mostly empty space. They all look up in silence at him. Long

pause, then SAM'S face begins to glow a bit. His posture

straightens, he fills up. He speaks slowly at first then

builds.

SAM ROGERS

You are all still here for a reason...

Most of this floor was just sent home...

forever. We have spent the last hour

saying good-bye... they were good people

and they were good at their jobs... but

you all were better. Now they are gone.

They are not to be thought of again. This

is your opportunity. On every floor of

this building and in every office from

Hong Kong to London the same thing is

happening. Before this is all done 3 of

every ten guys who were standing between

you and your boss's job are now gone.

That is your opportunity. I've been at

this place for thirty-four years and let

me tell you that this will not be the

last time you go through this. But you

all are survivors... And that is how this

firm over 107 years has always continued

to grow stronger. So hold your heads

high... and get back to work.

He looks out at them then turns and heads back into his

office and closes the door.

SAM falls into the couch and looks forward in a deflated

daze. His eyes no longer believe what he says.

ERIC DALE walks out the front door carrying the file boxes.

There are other people streaming out the door doing the same

thing. ERIC stops, turns, and looks up at the building then

tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it

has been shut off by the firm. He looks up to the sky and

can't believe his fate. As he looks down he sees a woman,

SARAH ROBERTSON, serious, classically beautiful and dressed

in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into

the building. He can't help himself.

Emerson?

PETER

You have to go get him, and get back up

here.

SETH

Where?

PETER

The office.

SETH

What!

PETER

I'm serious.

SETH

You want me to get our boss's boss out of

a club and bring him back to the office

at 10:00 on a Thursday night?

PETER

Our boss just got axed, so technically he

is our boss, and yes.

SETH

Why?

PETER

Just do it Seth.

Alright, we'll be there in ten.

WILL EMERSON

Hey, look who it is, burning the candle

at both ends. There aren't anymore cuts

planned though, so you can stop kissing

my ass, honestly I don't even understand

what you guys do.

PETER

Will, I am so sorry to call you back but

I really think..

WILL EMERSON

Don't worry about it.

SETH

Hey.

SETH (cont'd)

What's going on?

PETER

Look at this.

PETER (cont'd)

Eric gave me this file before he left.

SETH

Eric?

PETER

Dale. And he told me he couldn't quite

figure it out, then the last thing he

says as the doors on the elevator close

is `be careful'.

WILL EMERSON

Be careful?

PETER

So I'm obviously a little curious. So I

get into it a bit and I realize that all

he was missing was...well it's not good.

What is he doing here?

PETER

Go to model four, and it makes more

sense.

SETH

Oh.

WILL EMERSON

What is this?

PETER

This is basically everything that we have

on our books at any given time. But what

Eric was trying to do here is work it for

levels of volatility that fall outside

the limits of our standard VAR model.

WILL EMERSON

What are those levels.

PETER

Well it's a fairly complicated...

WILL EMERSON

Simplify.

PETER

The volatility boundaries are basically

set using historic patterns then

stretching them out another 10-15%...

roughly.

WILL EMERSON

So what's happening?

SETH

We are starting to test those historic

patterns.

WILL EMERSON

When?

Fuck me... Once this thing gets going in

the wrong direction...

PETER

Yeah...

SETH

It's huge.

WILL EMERSON

How huge?

The losses are greater than the current

value of the company...?

But you need to see this.

What, we got them on our way to meet you

fuck you wanted to talk about...

(almost to himself)

... thought you might've gotten some

chick pregnant or something.

PETER

I haven't gotten laid in so long that's

not possible at this point.

SETH

I guess that's true.

PETER

Look at these people.

SETH

What?

PETER

We are in here stressing our fucking

PETER

I've noticed that about you actually.

SETH

Look, we are twenty three years old...

PETER

Twenty-Seven.

SETH

Whatever, same thing, I made almost a

quarter of a million dollars last year...

for what... pushing some numbers around

on a computer screen, so a bunch of

glorified crack addicts could take that

information and pretend to understand it,

and then make a bet against some other

jock half way around the world who if he

wasn't doing this would probably be in

some OTB somewhere putting it all on

number seven. And at the end of the day

one guy loses and the other guy wins.

PETER

You do know it's a little more

complicated than that?

SETH

It's Will... He wants to know if we've

found him? What do I tell him.

PETER

Tell him that we haven't found him.

23                                                                   23

WILL EMERSON

Hey.

SAM ROGERS

So?

WILL EMERSON

Eric Dale...

SAM ROGERS

Oh Jesus...

WILL EMERSON

Before he was escorted out of the

building by security...

SAM ROGERS

I had nothing to do with that.

WILL EMERSON

I know.

SAM ROGERS

I'm sorry, go on.

WILL EMERSON

So as he was leaving the building he

hands a disk to Peter Sullivan...

SAM ROGERS

Who's Peter Sullivan again?

WILL EMERSON

One of Eric's guys.

SAM ROGERS

Right.

WILL EMERSON

...and tells him that he was almost on to

something but hasn't been able to figure

it out. So he gives him the disk and says

give it a try... but the last thing he

says as the doors to the elevator close

is `be careful'...

SAM ROGERS

Be careful?

(CONTINUED)

24.

24   CONTINUED: (2)                                                24

WILL EMERSON

Yeah.

SAM ROGERS

Be careful?

WILL EMERSON

Yes.

SAM ROGERS

Why?

WILL EMERSON

Well... take a look.

SAM ROGERS

Speak, you know I can't read those

fucking things they put together.

WILL EMERSON

Basically the kid dives right into the

thing after your little pep talk, nice

job by the way, and he seems to have

nailed it.

SAM ROGERS

Nailed it?

WILL EMERSON

The kid figured out what Eric was

missing. And...

SAM ROGERS

And?

WILL EMERSON

...it isn't good.

WILL EMERSON (cont'd)

As far as I can tell these here are the

historical volatility index limits...

which I guess our whole fucking trading

model relies on pretty heavily... and we

are so fucking levered up that if this

thing starts getting outside those limits

it gets ugly in a hurry.

SAM ROGERS

How ugly?

(CONTINUED)

25.

24   CONTINUED: (3)                                                24

WILL EMERSON

Real ugly.

SAM ROGERS

And how close to those limits have we

gotten?

WILL EMERSON

Oh we're beyond close... We broke through

five or six days over the last two weeks,

but we've managed to stay on the upside

of it... for now...

SAM ROGERS

For now?

WILL EMERSON

Well look what happens here when we get

on the wrong side of it.

SAM ROGERS

What am I looking at?

WILL EMERSON

And that wouldn't even be that bad a day

for us... historically speaking.

SAM ROGERS

Is this right?

WILL EMERSON

I don't know.

SAM ROGERS

Where is Eric?

WILL EMERSON

We shut his phone off.

SAM ROGERS

Of course we did.

WILL EMERSON

And he hasn't come home yet, I spoke to

his wife.

SAM ROGERS

He's probably crying in a fucking beer

somewhere.

WILL EMERSON

Or worse.

SAM ROGERS

Where's the kid who did this?

WILL EMERSON

Out looking for Eric.

SAM ROGERS

Do we think he knows what he's doing?

WILL EMERSON

I don't know. What do I know?

SAM ROGERS

Well get him back here.

25

PETER

What now?

SETH

We should probably tell Will he's not

here.

PETER

Yeah.

SETH

What do you think this girl makes in a

night?

PETER

Seth.

SETH

1500?

SETH (cont'd)

2000? Fuck. That's.... All things

SETH

He's freaking out. We need to get down

there.

SETH (cont'd)

What'a you think Rogers makes in a year?

PETER

I have no idea?

SETH

Come on, play along.

PETER

I don't know what year?

SETH

Last year.

PETER

Three quarters of a million bucks?

Come on.

PETER

More?

SETH

Yes.

PETER

A million?

Will Emerson made two and half million

bucks last year.

PETER

Fuck you.

PETER (cont'd)

Fuck you!

SETH

He did.

PETER

How do you know that?

SETH

He told me.

PETER

He just told you that?

SETH

Well I asked him.

Do you think that's true.

Probably.

SAM ROGERS

Well... it should be here in a minute.

Finding someone in the copy room at this

hour was a little bit of a challenge.

JARED COHEN

Well why don't we start by introducing

everyone then.

SAM ROGERS

OK.

JARED COHEN

This is Sarah Robertson who you know, our

chief risk management officer, Ramesh

Shah from upstairs, and David Horn one of

the firm's in house counsel.

SAM ROGERS

Nice to meet you all. This is Will

Emerson my head of trading, and this

is...

WILL EMERSON

Peter Sullivan, and Seth Bregman. They

work in our risk department.

JARED COHEN

Where is Eric Dale?

SAM ROGERS

He was let go today.

JARED COHEN

So who's left in your risk department?

WILL EMERSON

As of today that would be Peter and our

junior analyst Seth...?

JARED COHEN

Really?

COPY ROOM GUY

Will Emerson?

WILL EMERSON

Here. Please just give one to everyone,

thanks.

SAM ROGERS

So apparently Eric had been working on

this for some time but was unable to

finish it, as he was leaving the building

today he gave the program to Peter here,

and told him to see what he thought.

Peter figured a few things out that Eric

seemed to be missing and this is what

came out.

JARED COHEN

Where is Eric Dale now?

SAM ROGERS

He's been unreachable since he left the

office.

SARAH ROBERTSON

Peter this is your work?

PETER

Mainly Mr. Dale's...

SARAH ROBERTSON

But this draft is yours?

PETER

Yes. Again, derived from Mr. Dale's

original model. But yes.

SARAH ROBERTSON

And what is your background?

PETER

Background?

SARAH ROBERTSON

Your CV.

PETER

I have been with the firm for two years

working with Eric that whole time... But

I hold a doctorate in engineering,

specialist in propulsion, from MIT, with

a Bachelors from Penn.

JARED COHEN

What's a specialty in propulsion?

PETER

Well... in laymen terms my thesis was a

study in the way that friction ratios

effect steering outcomes in aeronautical

use under reduced gravity loads.

JARED COHEN

So you are a rocket scientist?

PETER

Um... I was... yes.

JARED COHEN

How did you end up here?

PETER

Well it's all just numbers really, you're

just changing what you're adding up...

and if I may speak freely the money is

considerably more attractive here.

JARED COHEN

What time is it?

RAMESH

It's 2:15.

JARED COHEN

What do you have in exposure right now,

tonight?

SAM ROGERS

I don't know... between 900 and 1.3...

roughly.

RAMESH

If Mr. Sullivan's numbers are correct...

PETER

1.215 Trillion.

RAMESH

Yes.

JARED COHEN

Fuck me... fuck me... And I'm guessing by

the fact that you two haven't said

anything that the math checks out?

SARAH ROBERTSON

Look    we'd need a little more time to go

over    this, but Mr. Sullivan here seems to

know    what he's doing. And I don't have to

tell    you that this is a problem.

JARED COHEN

Thank you for that. What time is it?

RAMESH

2:16.

JARED COHEN

Fuck me!

JARED COHEN (cont'd)

Sam how long under normal operations

would it take your people to clear that

from our books?

SAM ROGERS

What?

JARED COHEN

The 1.2 trillion.

SAM ROGERS

All of it?

JARED COHEN

Yes.

SAM ROGERS

I don't know, a couple weeks?

JARED COHEN

Weeks?

SAM ROGERS

Yes. But as you certainly know our

business is selling AND buying. It

doesn't work for very long without both

components. If we suddenly stop buying

for a day or two that just doesn't hide

under the rug, it gets out and this whole

this thing comes to a end... and right

quick.

JARED COHEN

I understand.

SAM ROGERS

Do you?

JARED COHEN

How many traders do we have left between

your floor and Petersen's?

SAM ROGERS

I don't know, sixty.

RAMESH

Jared I've just been looking here a

little closer, and it's these VAR numbers

that are really setting this thing off.

JARED COHEN

Excuse me, I need to make a quick call.

RAMESH

I was just saying, and just speaking

completely off the record here, it won't

be long before someone else starts

putting these in and sees the exact same

thing we are looking at here. If they

haven't already.

JARED COHEN

Understood... And Sarah, what value would

you allow to be placed on those assets

that might be left on the books, if they

had to be?

SARAH ROBERTSON

Why would they still be on the books?

SAM ROGERS

Because suddenly no one wants to buy

them.

JARED COHEN

Oh fuck you Sam... give me a fucking

break, all at once?

SARAH ROBERTSON

Without an active market, it could take

weeks, months for me to value them

correctly. You'd have to go block by

block.

SAM ROGERS

It's a very simple business Jared. You

and I talked about this last year...

JARED COHEN

Sam.... Will, Peter, and..??

JARED COHEN

And Mr. Dale.

PETER

Yes.

JARED COHEN

And can it really be that we don't know

where Eric Dale is?

WILL EMERSON

I'm afraid so. His wife tells us he

hasn't come home yet...and the firm shut

off his phone today.

JARED COHEN

Perfect. Well, I need to know where he

is.

Two and a half million goes quickly?

Well the tax man takes half of it up

front. So now you got what... million and

a quarter. Mortgage grabs another 300K, I

No... I don't want to hear this.

SAM ROGERS (cont'd)

How do you think I've stuck around this

place so long.

JARED COHEN

I've called Tuld.

SARAH ROBERTSON

Is there a contingency plan here?

JARED COHEN

A contingency plan?

SARAH ROBERTSON

Yes.

JARED COHEN

We went all in on this one.

SARAH ROBERTSON

So we've got ourselves quite exposed

here... haven't we?

JARED COHEN

To Tuld or the market?

SARAH ROBERTSON

Both.

WILL EMERSON

We were just grabbing a cigarette on the

roof and a very spiffy looking helicopter

dive-bombed us and then landed.

JARED COHEN

I know. Come with us. Where's Sam.

WILL EMERSON

I don't know. Do you want all of us>

JARED COHEN

Yes.

JARED COHEN

Just one piece of advice to everyone here

before we go in there... this could get a

bit ugly but whatever you do... just...

tell the truth... don't try to change a

word of it, no sugar coating... no one

here is smart enough... including the

rocket scientist.

Mr. Cohen?

JOHN TULD

Please sit down.

JOHN TULD (cont'd)

Welcome everyone. I must apologize for

dragging you all here at such an uncommon

hour but from what I've been told this

matter needs to be handled urgently, so

urgently in fact that it probably should

have been addressed weeks ago...

JOHN TULD (cont'd)

but that is spilt milk under the bridge.

So why doesn't someone please try to

explain to me what's the problem here?

JARED COHEN

Well, Mr. Tuld as I mentioned earlier if

you look here at the top page of this

printout...

JOHN TULD

Jared, it's a little early for all that,

how bout in English? ... Actually I'd

like to hear from the guy who put this

thing together... Mr. Sullivan is it?

Does he speak English?

JARED COHEN

Sir?

JOHN TULD

I'd like to speak to the analyst who

seems to have stumbled across this mess.

JARED COHEN

Well, that's Peter Sullivan here.

PETER

Sir.

JOHN TULD

Ah, there he is.

PETER

Yes sir.

JOHN TULD

How old are you Mr. Sullivan?

PETER

I'm twenty-seven sir.

JOHN TULD

Please call me John.

PETER

Yes sir.

(CONTINUED)

JOHN TULD

So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me

what you think is going on here, and

please speak as you might to a young

child or a golden retriever, I didn't get

here on my brains I can assure you of

that.

PETER

Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not

know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an

associate in the risk assessment and

management office at MBS

JOHN TULD

Now you lost me at M...

PETER

Sorry...

JOHN TULD

I was joking Mr. Sullivan.

PETER

Yes... Well as you probably know over the

last 36-40 months the firm has begun

packaging new MBS products that combine

several different traunches of rating

classification in one tradable security.

This has been very profitable as I

imagine you noticed.

JOHN TULD

I have.

PETER

Well the firm is currently doing a

considerable amount of this business

every day. The problem, which is I guess

why we are here tonight, is that it takes

us... the firm... almost a month to layer

these products correctly thereby posing a

challenge from a risk management

standpoint.

JOHN TULD

And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?

PETER

We have to hold these assets on our books

longer than we might ideally like to.

(CONTINUED)

50.

45   CONTINUED: (3)                                                45

JOHN TULD

Yes.

PETER

But the key factor is these are

essentially just mortgages, so that has

allowed us to push the leverage

considerably beyond what you might be

willing, or allowed to do in any other

circumstance, thereby pushing the risk

profile without raising any red flags.

JOHN TULD

And how far have we pushed that profile

tonight Mr. Sullivan?

PETER

We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion

dollars... at MBS alone.

JOHN TULD

Give or take.

PETER

Give or take.

JOHN TULD

Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and

give me a little rope here, what I am

guessing that your report here says is

that considering the, shall we say bumpy

road, we've been on the last week or so

that the numbers that your brilliant co-

workers up the line ahead of you had come

up with in the past don't seem to make

much sense anymore considering what's

taking place today?

PETER

Actually not taking place today but

what's already taken place over the last

two weeks.

JOHN TULD

So what you're saying is it's already

happened?

PETER

Sort of.

JOHN TULD

And Mr. Sullivan what does your model say

that means for us here?

(CONTINUED)

51.

45   CONTINUED: (4)                                                45

PETER

Well, that's where it becomes a

projection. But...

JOHN TULD

You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan.

PETER

Well... sir... if those assets were to

decrease by just 25 percent, and remain

on our books... well... that loss would

be greater than the current market

capitalization of this company.

JOHN TULD

So what you're telling me Mr. Sullivan is

that the music appears to be about to

stop and we are going to be holding the

biggest bag of stinking shit ever

assembled in the history of capitalism?

JOHN TULD (cont'd)

Mr. Sullivan?

PETER

Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that

way but let me clarify using your

analogy, what this model shows is the

music, so to speak, just slowing, if the

music were to stop, as you put it, then

this model would not be even close to

that scenario. It would be considerably

worse.

JOHN TULD

Well let me tell you something Mr.

Sullivan. Do you want to know why I'm

sitting here in this chair with you all,

why I get the big bucks, so to speak?

PETER

Yes.

JOHN TULD

I'm here for one reason and one reason

only.

(CONTINUED)

52.

JOHN TULD (cont'd)

I'm here to guess what the music is gonna

do a week, month, a year from now. That's

it, nothing more....... and I'm afraid...

standing here tonight... that I don't

hear... a... thing... just silence.

JOHN TULD (cont'd)

So, now that we know that the music has

stopped, what can we do about it?

JOHN TULD (cont'd)

Mr. Cohen, Ms. Robertson, I'm afraid this

is where you are supposed to step back

in. Lord knows we relied enough on Mr.

Sullivan today.

JOHN TULD (cont'd)

What have you got for us?

JOHN TULD (cont'd)

What have I told you since the first day

you walked into my office? (pause) That

there are three ways to make a living in

this business... Be first, be smarter, or

cheat. Well I don't cheat, and even

though I like to think we have got some

pretty smart people in this building of

the two remaining options, it sure is a

hell of alot easier to just be first.

JARED COHEN

Sell it all today...

JOHN TULD

Is that even possible Sam?

It is, but at what cost?

JOHN TULD

I'll pay.

SAM ROGERS

Really?

JOHN TULD

I think so.

SAM ROGERS

Almost a trillion bucks of paper?

JOHN TULD

Where does it come back to us?

SAM ROGERS

Everywhere.

JOHN TULD

Sam, I don't think you seem to understand

what your boy down here just said... if I

made you... how would you do it?

SAM ROGERS

You bring the traders in for their normal

6:30 meeting and you be honest with them,

they're gonna know it's the end either

way, so you'd have to throw them a bone,

and a pretty big one. You'd have to come

out of the gate storming... 40 percent

done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your

positions need to be gone by eleven,

cause by lunch the word will be out. No

swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock

you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar,

if you're lucky, and the feds will be in

here looking up your ass and trying to

slow us down.

JOHN TULD

RAMESH

They'll slow you down but it's yours to

sell. They can't stop you.

SAM ROGERS

John... let's just say we pull that off,

which is saying something... the real

question is... who are we selling this

to?

JOHN TULD

The same people you've been selling this

to for the last two years... and whoever

else will buy it.

SAM ROGERS

If you do this you've killed that market

for years. It's over.

JOHN TULD

(Nods.)

SAM ROGERS

And you are selling something you know

has no value.

JOHN TULD

(cuts him off cold)

We are selling to willing buyers at the

current fair market price, so that WE may

survive, Sam.

SAM ROGERS

You'll never sell a thing to any one of

them again.

JOHN TULD

I understand.

SAM ROGERS

Do you?

JOHN TULD

Do you!!! This is it, Sam, this is it!

JOHN TULD (cont'd)

Eric Dale.

JOHN TULD

SAM ROGERS

Never really did it for me actually.

JOHN TULD

Really?

SAM ROGERS

Always been kinda a grass and tree guy.

JOHN TULD

I've always loved this place. Ever since

I arrived. Everything about it.

SAM ROGERS

I can't say I feel that about anyplace

actually.

JOHN TULD

Are you going to be able to come on board

here Sam?

They look at each other.

SAM ROGERS

I'm not sure John. This is really ugly.

JOHN TULD

You and I are salesmen Sam, we sell.

That's what we do. It's not complicated.

SAM ROGERS

Exactly. And you damn well know that you

don't make a sale unless you think the

guy is gonna come back for more, and

tomorrow we are done.

JOHN looks out and then over at SAM and decides whether or

not to proceed.

JOHN TULD

This is it Sam.

SAM ROGERS

You keep saying that, what is that

supposed to mean?

JOHN TULD

It's the big one. Most of us aren't gonna

make it out of this one.

JOHN TULD

The street.

SAM ROGERS

What are you talking about?

JOHN TULD

This won't be the last `situation' I will

be having this week. It's just the start.

SAM ROGERS

It's only the start because we are

starting it.

JOHN TULD

Maybe. But I don't think that's true, not

this time. The numbers just don't add up

anymore.

SAM ROGERS

Well I agree with you there, I've been

saying that for years.

JOHN TULD

I mean if this kid can come up with

this...?

SAM ROGERS

I don't think I can go in knowing what I

know and put the hammer down on these

guys like this.

JOHN TULD

Oh please, when did you become so soft.

SAM ROGERS

Fuck you soft, you're panicking.

The word panic slaps JOHN TULD in the face. He then calms.

JOHN TULD

If you're the first one out the door Sam,

it's not called panicking

JOHN TULD stares aggressively at SAM.

SAM ROGERS

Look, I obviously don't have all the

information that you do. But I think this

could destroy this firm.

JARED COHEN

That's where I'm headed right now,

downstairs to work on it with my guys.

SARAH ROBERTSON

No, you and I... with Tuld.

JARED COHEN

I'm not sure we need one, Sarah. That's

not the way I've ever done this.

SARAH ROBERTSON

(with distinct sarcasm)

Please.

JARED COHEN

He knows where we both have stood on this

all along. There's nothing more to do.

SARAH ROBERTSON

That's exactly my point, and knowing what

was discussed by both you and I with him,

I don't see how that can possibly you

with anything but a false sense of

comfort.

JARED COHEN

I'm not looking for a sense of comfort

here, Sarah. I don't think there is one

to be found.

SARAH ROBERTSON

So again, what's the strategy here?

JARED COHEN

On this particular front, I'm just not

sure there's much left to do.

What is it?

JARED COHEN

Tuld and I have concerns that Sam may not

be willing to step up and do the right

thing here.

WILL

I don't think that's ever been a problem.

JARED COHEN

Of course it hasn't, but during acute

situations, such as this, often what is

right can take on multiple

interpretations.

But if he doesn't, we need to know that

you will.

WILL

That I will what?

JARED COHEN

Step up.

I have no doubt Sam will make the right

choice. And if it makes you feel any

better he and I have always had the same

interpretation of what's right...no

matter how acute the situation.

SAM ROGERS comes across the room and over to the sinks to

wash his hands. He looks in the mirror, and then decides to

wash his face as well. He stares at himself in the mirror.

The water drips off his face. He looks old. Just then the

door opens and JOHN TULD walks into the room. He does not go

to use any of the facilities. He stops and looks to talk to

SAM.

JOHN TULD

There he is.

SAM ROGERS

John.

SAM walks over and takes a towel to wipe off his hands and

face. Finally he looks up.

SAM ROGERS (cont'd)

So what's it look like John?

The line is delivered a bit too lightly for JOHN TULD'S

liking.

JOHN TULD

Cohen has done a nice job. It can work.

SAM ROGERS

What does that mean?

JOHN TULD

It means, as you very well know, that you

are a very important piece of this

puzzle.

They look directly at each other.

JOHN TULD (cont'd)

Here.

JOHN TULD hands SAM a single piece of folded paper. SAM opens

it and looks at it.

SAM ROGERS

That's very generous.

JOHN TULD

It's not a gift. I need to know you are

with me on this.

SAM ROGERS

I'm with the firm John.

JOHN TULD

I won't get what I need out of your boys

today unless they believe you... unless

they believe in you completely.

JOHN TULD (cont'd)

Are you in?

SAM ROGERS

I told you I have my reservations.

JOHN TULD

Well you can't have any reservations.

JOHN TULD (cont'd)

And I need to know now.

SAM ROGERS

I'm with the firm completely John, as I

always have been. Excuse me.

I'm sorry?

A bridge.

WILL EMERSON

No, I didn't.

ERIC

I was an engineer by trade.

WILL EMERSON

Well...

ERIC

It goes from Dilles Bottom, Ohio to

Moundsville West Virginia. It spans 912

feet over the Ohio river. Steel through

arch design. 12,100 people a day use the

thing.

It cut out 35 miles each way of extra

driving to get from Wheeling to New

Martinsville. That's a combined 847,000

miles of driving a day... and 25,410,000

miles a month and 304,920,000 miles a

year saved.

ERIC (cont'd)

I completed that project in 1986... 22

years ago. Over the life of that one

bridge that's 6 billion... 708 million...

240 thousand miles that haven't had to be

driven! At let's say... 50 miles an hour

that's 134,164,800 hours... or 559,020

days... so that one little bridge has

saved the people of those two communities

a combined 1531 years of their lives not

wasted in the car... give or take.

Don't be, you're not doing it to me.

SETH

Are you ok with that?

WILL EMERSON

I'm about to completely fuck guys I've

been doing business with for fifteen

years so no I'm not exactly ok with it.

But look, every last one of them would do

Normal people.

WILL EMERSON

What are you a socialist? Fuck me Seth.

WILL EMERSON (cont'd)

Look, If you want to do this with your

that you are necessary. And you are. If

people want to live like this...with

their big cars and these houses that they

haven't even paid for. Then you are

necessary. The only reason they can

Then the whole world gets really fucking

fair, really fucking quickly. And no one

pretend they have no idea how we get it.

And that's more hypocrisy than I can

swallow. So fuck em.

WILL EMERSON (cont'd)

And tomorrow if this all goes south

they'll crucify us for being reckless,

WILL EMERSON

Alright, hey...(whistles).

SAM ROGERS

Thank you all for coming in a little

early this morning, I know yesterday was

pretty bad, I wish I could say that today

is going to be less so but that isn't

going to be the case. Now I am supposed

to read this statement here to you all

but how bout you read it on your own time

and I'll just tell you what the fuck's

going on here.

SAM ROGERS (cont'd)

I have spent the night here meeting with

the executive committee and the decision

has been made to begin to unwind a

considerable portion of the firm's

holdings in several key asset classes.

The crux of it is... in the firm's

thinking the party is over as of this

morning. There is going to be

considerable turmoil in the markets for

the foreseeable future. They believe that

it is better to have this turmoil begin

with us... as a result the firm has

decided to liquidate the majority of its

position of fixed income MBS today.

SAM ROGERS (cont'd)

You should be getting a breakdown right

now, you will see the accounts you are

responsible for today. I'm sure it hasn't

taken you long to understand the

implications of this sale on your

relationships with your counterparties

and as a result on your careers. I have

expressed this reality to the executive

committee and they understand. As a

result, if you are able to complete a 93%

sale of your assets you will receive a

1.4 million dollar one off bonus.

SAM ROGERS (cont'd)

If the floor as a whole is able to

achieve a 93% sale we all get an

additional 1.3 million a piece. Because

of this, if you burn through your

allotment by noon, get moving around the

floor and start picking up other guys

leftovers...

SAM ROGERS (cont'd)

For those of you who have never been

through this before, this is what the

beginning of a fire sale looks like. I

don't have to tell any of you that the

first hour and a half is going to be very

important. I want you to hit every bite

you can find. Dealers, clients, brokers,

and your mother if she's buying...and

obviously no swaps, its outgoing only

today. This is obviously not the way any

of us would like for this to be going

down, but the ground is shifting below

our feet, and there appears to be no

other way out.

SAM ROGERS (cont'd)

Obviously... this is a very unique

situation... if we are successful today

we will have been successful in

destroying our own jobs... I can not

promise that each of you will be

repositioned within the firm, but I can

tell you that I am very proud of the work

we have done together here, I have been

at this here for 34 years, and I know...

from experience people are going to say

some nasty stuff about what we have done

here, and what you have devoted a portion

the greater picture our skills have not

JOHN TULD

By the end of today almost everyone else

in the world, including me, will have

considerably less money than they began

the day with..... You, in this room, are

the exception. You will leave here today

richer. You will fire the first shot, I

wish it didn't have to be, but at times

the market must eat its weak, and you

all... are not the weak. We must strike

quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause

on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is

going to be in here getting in your

faces, sniffing around, you let us take

care of them and you just keep going. We

own what we are choosing to sell today

and there is nothing they can do about

it. 107 years ago this firm was founded,

today we secure our place for next 107.

You've got two minutes before we get

started. Let's finish this, so we can get

on to the next one...

JARED COHEN

Well done.

SAM ROGERS

They did alright.

JARED COHEN

I wanted to give you a heads up. They are

going to start sending some people home

out here.

SAM ROGERS

Now?

JARED COHEN

(He nods yes) Sorry. No loose ends.

SAM ROGERS

Of course.

JARED COHEN

For what it's worth, you're good... Guess

somebody upstairs must really like you.

72                                                                    72

JOHN TULD

Sam, please sit. Congratulations are

clearly in order.

SAM ROGERS

Our guys did what they could.

JOHN TULD

You did a hell of a job today, and I

thank you for it. Sit, excuse me for

eating but it's been a long day. Can I

get you anything?

SAM ROGERS

No, no thanks.

TULD

So what can I do for you?

SAM ROGERS

I want out.

TULD

I'm sorry?

SAM ROGERS

I'm done, I want out.

TULD

It's been a very difficult day, for

everyone.

SAM ROGERS

I need you to release my options, that is

if they're still worth anything after

today, and I need the bonus. I'm out.

TULD

You'll get the bonus, the options, and

keep your current base, but I need you to

stay with me for another 24 months. O.K?

TULD (cont'd)

For God's sake man put a smile on your

face, you did some good today, you said

so yourself. I'm starting to feel a

little better about this whole thing.

You're one of the luckiest guys in the

world, you could've been digging ditches

all these years...

(CONTINUED)

73   CONTINUED: (2)                                                73

SAM ROGERS

That's true, and if I had been at least

there'd be some holes in the ground to

show for it. I'm just not quite sure how

we fucked this thing up so badly.

TULD

Jesus, when did you start feeling so

sorry for yourself, it's unbearable...

What, you think we may have helped put

some people out of business today? That

it's all just for naught? Well you've

been doing that everyday for almost forty

years Sam. And if all this is for naught

then so is everything else out there.

It's just money, it's made up, a piece of

paper with some pictures on it so we

don't all kill each other trying to get

something to eat. But it's not wrong and

it's certainly not any different today

than it's ever been. Ever. 1637, 1797,

1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37,

`73, and 1987... God damn did that

motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97,

2000, and whatever this is gonna be

called. They're just the same thing over

and over. We can't help ourselves, and

you and I can't control it, stop it, slow

it, or even ever so slightly alter it...

We just react... and we get paid well for

it if we're right... and get left by the

side of the road if we're wrong. There's

always been and there's always gonna be

the same percentage of winners and

losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat

pigs and starving dogs in this world...

yes there may be more of us today... but

the percentages... they always stay

exactly the same.

SAM ROGERS

I'll do it John, but not because of your

little speech, but because I need the

money. I'm not sure how it could possibly

be after all these years, but I need the

money.

SAM ROGERS (cont'd)

You're keeping the kid?

JOHN TULD

Keeping him? He's getting promoted. It's

all hands on deck now Sam, there's going

to be a lot of money to be made coming

out of this mess, we're going to need all

the brains we can get around here.

MARY ROGERS

her. This is where she belongs...

MARY ROGERS

Well. You should have called.

SAM ROGERS

MARY ROGERS

SAM ROGERS

Good, I was going to call him this

morning... but...

MARY ROGERS

Well, I am going to go back in to bed.

(Sam smiles)

Well, you take care of yourself.
