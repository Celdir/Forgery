REVOLUTIONARY ROAD

Justin Haythe

FRANK

So, what do you do?

APRIL

I'm studying to be an actress.

You?

FRANK

I'm a longshoreman.

APRIL

(smiles)

No, I mean really.

FRANK

I mean really too. Starting

Monday, though, I'm doing something

a little more glamorous. Night

cashier at a cafeteria.

APRIL

(smiles)

I don't mean how you make money.   I

mean what are you interested in?

FRANK

Honey - if I had the answer to that

one, I bet I'd bore us both to

death in half an hour.

2.

SMASH CUT TO:

WOMAN

Thank God that's over...

WOMAN (CONT'D)

...And she was very disappointing.

3.

MRS. GIVINGS

Frank! Very nice Frank!

FRANK

Thanks, Mrs. Givings.

MRS. GIVINGS

I can't tell you how much we

enjoyed it. You have a very

talented wife.

FRANK

I'll pass it along!

MILLY

Frank!

FRANK

Hi!

MILLY

She's through there...!

(points)

You `bout ready for that drink?

4.

FRANK

Couple of minutes!

FRANK

(heartfelt)

April, sweetheart.   You were great.

I mean it.

APRIL

Hi. You about ready to leave?

I've just got to get this makeup

off, then we can go.

FRANK

Well... I guess it wasn't a triumph

or anything, was it?

APRIL

I guess not. I'll be ready in a

minute.

FRANK

Take your time.

5.

APRIL

Will you do me a favor? Milly and

Shep wanted us to go out with them

afterwards. Will you say we can't?

Say it's because of the baby sitter

or something?

FRANK

Well, the thing is, I already said

that we could. I mean, I just saw

them out there and I said we would.

APRIL

(tense)

Oh. Then would you mind going out

again and saying you were mistaken?

That should be simple enough.

FRANK

Don't you think that's a little bit

rude, April?

APRIL

Well I'll tell them myself.

FRANK

Okay. Okay. Take it easy. I'll

tell them.

6.

FRANK

I mean it, baby. You were the only

person in that play.

APRIL

Thank you.

FRANK

We just never should've let you get

mixed up in the damned thing.

APRIL

All right.

FRANK

You've studied for Christ's sake.

APRIL

Could we sort of stop talking about

it now?

FRANK

Sure. I just don't want you

feeling bad about it, that's all.

Because it's not worth it. I mean,

it's bad enough having to live out

here among these damn people -

what'd you say?

APRIL

I said yes. All right, Frank.

Could you just stop talking now,

before you drive me crazy, please?

APRIL (CONT'D)

What are you doing? Why are we

stopping?

7.

APRIL

No, Frank, please don't...

FRANK

Baby, it's okay...

APRIL

Please don't touch me.

FRANK

April...

APRIL

Why can't you...just... LEAVE ME

ALONE!

FRANK

It strikes me, that there's a

considerable amount of bullshit

going on here.... And there's one

or two things I'd like to clear up.

Number one, it's not my fault the

play was lousy. Number two, it's

sure as hell not my fault you

didn't turn out to be an actress,

and the sooner you get over that

little piece of soap opera the

better off we'll both be. Number

three, I don't happen to fit the

role of dumb, insensitive suburban

husband; you've been trying to hang

that one on me ever since we moved

here. Number four -

8.

FRANK

What the hell are you doing?     Come

back to the car.

APRIL

No. Just let me stand here a

second.

FRANK

April?

FRANK (CONT'D)

Look, can't we sit in the car and

talk about it, instead of running

all over Route Twelve?

APRIL

Haven't I made it clear I don't

particularly want to talk about it?

FRANK

Okay. Jesus, I'm trying to be nice

about this thing.

APRIL

How kind of you. How terribly,

terribly kind of you.

FRANK

Wait a minute. I don't deserve

this.

9.

APRIL

You're always so wonderfully

definite, aren't you, on the

subject of what you do and don't

deserve?

FRANK

Wait a minute!

FRANK (CONT'D)

Wait a minute, God damn it!

FRANK (CONT'D)

You listen to me. This is one time

you're not going to get away with

twisting everything I say.

APRIL

Christ, I wish you'd stayed home

tonight!

FRANK

You know what you are when you're

like this? You're sick. I really

mean that. You're sick!

APRIL

And you know what you are?

(eyes raking him)

You're disgusting.

FRANK

Oh, yeah?

APRIL

Just because you've got me safely

in this little trap, you think you

can bully me into feeling whatever

you want!

10.

FRANK

You in a trap! You in a trap!

Jesus, don't make me laugh!

APRIL

Yes, me.

(clutching at her chest)

Me! Me! Me! Oh, you poor, pathetic

little boy  Look at you! Look at

you, and tell me how by any stretch

of the imagination you can call

yourself a man!

FRANK

Don't look at me like that, April.

APRIL

Could we please go home now?

11.

12.

JACK (O.S.)

I'm going to need your help this

morning, Old Scout.

JACK (CONT'D)

For the next few hours, you're to

warn me of Bandy's every approach

and you may have to screen me from

public view in the likely event I

that I throw up. It's that bad.

FRANK

Good morning, Jack.

JACK

Nothing good about it, I assure

you.

13.

MRS. GIVINGS

Of course, I knew the moment you

came off the train what you were

looking for... A small remodeled

barn, or a carriage house  And I

just hate to be the one to tell you

that sort of thing just isn't

available anymore... But I don't

want you to despair. There is one

place down here I want to show

you... Now of course it isn't very

desirable at this end.

(gestures)

As you see, Crawford Road is mostly

these little cinder-blocky, pick-up

trucky places  plumbers,

carpenters, little local people of

that sort.

MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)

But eventually...

(she points, her arm fully

extended)

Eventually it leads up to

Revolutionary Road, which is much

nicer. Now, the place I want to

show you, is a sweet little house

and a sweet little setting.

Simple, clean lines, good lawns,

marvelous for children. It's right

around this next curve... Now,

you'll see it  there.

MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)

See the little white one? Sweet

isn't it? The perky way it sits

there on its little slope?

Charming, isn't it?

14.

APRIL

Oh, yes.

FRANK

You wanted to see me?

BANDY

Came for you from Toledo this

morning.

BANDY (CONT'D)

This is the third one this month.

FRANK

Oh, right, sorry. I thought I'd

taken care of that...

BANDY

I'm not prepared to have this

conversation again, Frank. You

understand?

FRANK

...Absolutely, yes.

BANDY

These folks in the provinces look

up to us, Frank.    We need to be

efficient. We can't have this kind

of back and forth, and so forth.

It's just not efficient. Am I

right?

15.

FRANK

...Absolutely, yes, yes...

JACK

What was that about?

FRANK

Toledo. Branch manager wants a

revised brochure for the conference

on "The Knox 500."

(impersonating Bandy)

"It's just not efficient."

JACK

(sharp inhale)

Sounds like a real goodie.

FRANK

I don't even know what the Knox 500

does... Do you?

JACK

Don't insult me.

FRANK

Now, if you'll look in the inactive

file under SP-1109 you'll find

copies of all the stuff we sent to

the agency... and that way we can

trace the thing back to its

original sources.

16.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I hope you weren't planning on an

early lunch.

MAUREEN

I'm not really hungry.

FRANK

Good. I'll check on you later.

FRANK (CONT'D)

You know something? You're lucky

you met me.

MAUREEN

Oh?    How's that?

FRANK

I can show you the ropes. There's

an art to survival at Knox. Let me

show you what I mean.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Bring me the telephone would you?

And two more martinis.

MAUREEN

Wow.

17.

FRANK

Hello Mrs. Jorgensen. Frank

Wheeler here. Just wanted to let

you know that I've had to send

Maureen Grube down to Visual Aides

for me. I'll probably need her the

rest of the day... Okay? Fine.

You too.

MAUREEN

I never even heard of Visual Aides.

FRANK

That's because it doesn't exist.

MRS. GIVINGS (O.S.)

Yoo-hoo!

APRIL

Hi Helen.

MRS. GIVINGS

I can't stay a minute... My, don't

you look comfy! I just wanted to

bring this sedum for that messy

patch in the front yard.

18.

MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)

All it wants is just a tiny dollop

of water for the first few days,

and you'll find it absolutely

thrives.

APRIL

Well, thank you... You want some

coffee?

MRS. GIVINGS

Only if you're having some.

APRIL

Is there something I can do for

you, Helen?

MRS. GIVINGS

Oh... yes, I almost forgot. I do

have a small favor I'd like to

ask...

(quiver of anxiety )

It's about my son, John. He's been

in the hospital.

APRIL

I'm sorry to hear that.

MRS. GIVINGS

Well, actually, just for the

present, he's in Pleasant Brook...

Psychiatric.

APRIL

...I'm so sorry.

MRS. GIVINGS

Oh... Nothing serious. He just

got a little run down. Things can

just get the better of us

sometimes. Don't you think?

19.

APRIL

Yes.    Of course.

MRS. GIVINGS

It really is a marvellous facility

and the treatments seem to be doing

him wonders... Anyway, they said

getting out for an afternoon might

do him some good.

MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)

I think he finds my friends a

little conventional, frankly. I

mean, he's travelled. He has a PhD

in mathematics. I suppose you

could say he's an intellectual. It

would do him a world of good to

meet a young couple like you.

APRIL

We'd love to Helen.

MRS. GIVINGS

So, I thought perhaps if you had

some time...

APRIL

We'd love to.

MRS. GIVINGS

(flushed with relief)

Thank you, dear... Thank you.

MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)

I remember when you first came off

the train. You weren't like most

of my clients. You were different,

somehow.

20.

MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)

Well, you looked simply ravishing

and I just knew Frank did something

terribly brilliant in town. You

just seemed... special... Of

course you still are.

MAUREEN (O.S.)

I guess you got me a little drunk.

FRANK

You know what today is?

MAUREEN

...Monday?

FRANK

It's my birthday.      I'm thirty years

old today.

MAUREEN

Happy birthday!

21.

MAUREEN (CONT'D)

What was the name of the department

you made up again?

FRANK

Visual Aides.

MAUREEN

...What-a-joke.

FRANK

Want to hear a real joke...?

FRANK (CONT'D)

My old man worked at Knox.

MAUREEN

Yeah?

FRANK

He was a salesman in Yonkers. Once

a year he used to take me into the

city for lunch. It was supposed to

be a special, life-advice sort of

occasion.

MAUREEN

Nice.

FRANK

Not really... I used to sit there

and think, `I hope to Christ I

don't end up like you.'

FRANK (CONT'D)

And here I am, a thirty year old

Knox man. Can you beat that?

MAUREEN

I think I kind of lost you...   Your

father worked for Knox...?

(MORE)

22.

MAUREEN (CONT'D)

I'm sorry, but everything's kinda

going out of focus.

FRANK

How `bout some air?

FRANK

You ever been to Paris?

APRIL

I've never really been anywhere.

FRANK

Maybe I'll take you with me.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I'm going back first chance I get.

People are alive there.

23.

FRANK (CONT'D)

All I know now is that I want to

feel things. Really feel them.

How's that for an ambition...?

APRIL

Frank Wheeler?

FRANK

Mm?

APRIL

I think you're the most interesting

person I've ever met.

APRIL (CONT'D)

I mean it.

FRANK

Well, I guess this wasn't what you

had in mind when you went to work

this morning?

MAUREEN

No.   It certainly wasn't.

MAUREEN (CONT'D)

Do you have a cigarette, Frank?

24.

FRANK

Sure, here.

MAUREEN

Can I get you a drink or anything?

FRANK

No thanks, Maureen. Actually, I

guess I'd better be cutting out,

it's getting kind of late.

MAUREEN

Gee, that's right.   Have you missed

your train?

FRANK

It's all right, I'll get the next

one.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Listen: you were swell. Take care

now.

25.

APRIL

Frank...

FRANK

Why are you all dressed up?

APRIL

First of all, I missed you all day

and I want to say I'm sorry. I'm

sorry for the way I've been since

that stupid play. I'm sorry for

everything and... And I love

you... Now wait here till I call

you. Okay?

APRIL (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Alright Frank! You can come in

now!

26.

APRIL

Frank. I have had the most

wonderful idea. I've been thinking

about it all day.

FRANK

What's all this about?

APRIL

You know how much money we have

saved...?

APRIL (CONT'D)

Enough to live on for six months

without you earning another dime.

And with the money we could get

from the house and the car, longer

than that.

FRANK

What we get for the house...What

are you talking about? Where are

we going to live?

APRIL

...Paris.

APRIL (CONT'D)

You always said it was the only

place you'd ever been that was

worth living. So why don't we go

there?

27.

FRANK

You're serious?

APRIL

Yes.   What's stopping us?

FRANK

What's stopping us? Well, I can

think of a lot of things. For

instance, what kind of a job could

I possibly get?

APRIL

You won't be getting any kind of

job, because I will.

FRANK

Oh, right.

APRIL

Don't laugh -- listen a minute!

Have you any idea what they pay for

secretarial positions in the

government agencies in Europe?

Embassies and those things.

FRANK

No, I don't.

APRIL

I'm serious about this Frank. Do

you think I'm kidding or something?

FRANK

No, I know, I know. I just have a

couple of questions, is all. For

one thing, do you mind telling me

what exactly I'm supposed to be

doing while you're out earning all

this money?

28.

APRIL

Don't you see that's the whole

idea? You'll be doing what you

should've been allowed to do seven

years ago. You'll have time,

Frank. You'll have time to find

out what it is that you actually

want to do, and when you figure it

out you'll have the time and the

freedom to start doing it.

FRANK

Sweetheart, it's just not very

realistic, is all.

APRIL

Well, I happen to think this is

unrealistic. I think it's

unrealistic for a man with a fine

mind to go on working like a dog

year after year at a job he can't

stand, coming home to a place he

can't stand, to a wife who's

equally unable to stand the same

things.

APRIL (CONT'D)

You want to know the worst part?

Our whole existence here is based

on this great premise that we're

somehow very special and superior

to the whole thing, and you know

what I've realized...? We're not!

We're just like everyone else.

Look at us!   We've bought into the

same ridiculous delusion. This

idea that you have to resign from

life and settle down the moment you

have children. And we've been

punishing each other for it.

FRANK

Listen: we decided to move out

here. No one ever forced me to

take the job at Knox.

(MORE)

29.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I mean who ever said I was supposed

to be a big deal, anyway?

APRIL

When I first met you, there was

nothing in the world you couldn't

do or be.

FRANK

I was a little wise guy with a big

mouth, that's all.

APRIL

You were not! How can you even say

that?

FRANK

...All right... So, I'll have

time. And God knows that's

appealing. It's very appealing.

And I mean, everything you say

might make a certain amount of

sense, if I had some definite

talent maybe. If I were an artist

or a writer.

APRIL

But Frank, listen to me: It's what

you are that's being stifled here.

It's what you are that's being

denied and denied and denied in

this kind of life.

FRANK

And what's that?

APRIL

Don't you know...?

APRIL (CONT'D)

You're the most valuable and

wonderful thing in the world...

You're a man.

30.

APRIL (CONT'D)

This is our chance, Frank.   This is

our one chance.

FRANK

Okay.

APRIL

Okay?

FRANK

Why not...? Why the hell not?

JACK

Ah, Franklin. Good to see your

shining face.  What's the news?

FRANK

I'm moving to Paris.

JACK

Right.   And I'm moving to Tangiers.

31.

FRANK

...Intra-company letter to

Toledo... Attention B.F. Chalmers,

branch manager... With regard to

recent and repeated correspondence,

this is to advise that the matter

has been... very satisfactorily

taken in hand, period, paragraph.

FRANK (CONT'D)

We wholly agree that the existing

brochure is unsuitable. To this

end we have developed...

FRANK (CONT'D)

"Speaking of Production Control..."

CLERK (O.S.)

Here you are Mrs. Wheeler:

CLERK (CONT'D)

Here's the travellers checks you

asked for... and your steamer

reservations... and these I'll pass

on to the embassy for you.

APRIL

Thank you.

32.

CLERK

Good luck.

JACK

And when does this noble experiment

commence?

FRANK

September.     October at the outside.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I just happen to think people are

better off doing some kind of work

they actually like.

ED

(vague)

Right, yes.

VINCE

(mumbled)

Absolutely, absolutely.

JACK

But... I mean, assuming there is a

true vocation waiting for you.

Wouldn't you be just as likely to

discover it here as there?

33.

FRANK

No... I don't think it's possible

to discover anything on the

fifteenth floor of the Knox

building, and I don't think any of

you do either.

FRANK (CONT'D)

This one's on me.

34.

APRIL

...All the way to... here.

JENNIFER

But why?

APRIL

Well, sweetheart. It's a big world

out there and we thought maybe we

should go see a little bit of it.

MICHAEL

How far is it?

APRIL

A long way. We have to take a

boat ride over the sea to get

there.

JENNIFER

I won't know anyone there.

APRIL

I know. And neither will I. But

remember when you started school?

And now look how many friends you

have...

35.

FRANK

You'll never guess what they eat in

Paris. You'll never guess...

JENNIFER

What?

FRANK

Snails.

JENNIFER/MICHAEL

Snails?!

APRIL

And frog's legs!

SHEP

Buddappa banh!     Banh!   Banh!

MILLY

You better get changed, they'll be

here soon.

SHEP

That what you're wearing?

MILLY

(panic)

Don't you like it?

36.

SHEP

...No... No. You look great,

doll. Guess I better haul ass.

SHEP

Hiya gang.

MILLY (O.S.)

Shep?

37.

APRIL

Oh those look great.    I'm starving!

MILLY

April, I can't get over it - you

look like the cat who ate the

canary! Do you have something to

tell us? A little bit of news?

SHEP

(disapproving)

Not to pry or anything.

MILLY

(suddenly unsure)

I'm not prying. Am I prying?    I

didn't mean to.

FRANK

Actually, we have got some pretty

important news.

FRANK (CONT'D)

You want to tell `em?

APRIL

We're going to Europe.    To Paris...

To live.

MILLY

What?

38.

SHEP

When?

MILLY

Why?

FRANK

September.

MILLY

But what for?

FRANK

What for? Because we've always

wanted to. Because the kids are

still young. Because it's

beautiful. Shep, you tell her.

SHEP

...It's a great city.

MILLY

When did you make this decision?

APRIL

Oh... about a week ago... its hard

to remember. We just suddenly

decided to go, that's all.

MILLY

About a week ago, and you tell us

now!

APRIL

We had to get used to the idea.

SHEP

So, what's the deal, Frank? You

get a job over there, or what?

39.

FRANK

(smiles)

No. Not exactly.

SHEP

What do you mean, `not exactly?'

APRIL

Frank won't be doing any kind of a

job, because I will.

SHEP

(to Frank)

And what are you going to do?

FRANK

I'm going to study... and I'm going

to read and... I suppose I'm going

to finally figure out what I want

to do with my life.

SHEP

...While she supports you?

FRANK

Yes. While she supports me...   At

least in the beginning.

APRIL

You wouldn't believe what they pay

for secretarial work in government

agencies over there. NATO and

E.C.A. and those places.

FRANK

The cost of living is dirt cheap

compared to here, so we should be

all right.

APRIL

The truth is we just need something

different.

(MORE)

40.

APRIL (CONT'D)

We're not getting any younger and

we don't want life to just pass us

by.

MILLY

Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids. I

mean it; it really sounds

wonderful. We'll certainly miss

you, though - won't we, sweetie?

Golly.

SHEP

Sure.

MILLY

Paris.   Wow.

SHEP

You know what I think?

SHEP (CONT'D)

I think this whole plan sounds a

little immature.

MILLY

Oh God, I'm so relieved. Me too...

I was thinking that the whole time.

SHEP

What kind of man is going to sit

around in his bathrobe picking his

nose while his wife works all day?

41.

MILLY

I don't know, Shep.   I just don't

know.

SHEP

What is it?

MILLY

Nothing.   I'm just so relieved.

SHEP

Come on. Don't cry. Please. It's

all right. It's going to be all

right.

SHEP (CONT'D)

I'll go.

FRANK

Jesus, their faces! You'd think

we'd told them that we were

swimming up the Yangtzee river or

something.

FRANK (CONT'D)

You know what this is like, April?

Talking like this? The whole idea

of taking off to Europe this way?

It's like the way I felt going up

to the line the first time, in the

war. I was probably just as scared

as everyone else, but inside I

never felt better. I felt alive. I

felt full of blood.

(MORE)

42.

FRANK (CONT'D)

And everything looked more real.

The guys in their uniforms. The

snow on the fields, the trees. And

all of us just... walking. I mean

I was scared of course. But I kept

thinking: this is it. This is the

truth.

APRIL

I felt that way once too.

FRANK

When?

APRIL

The first time you made love to me.

APRIL (CONT'D)

...No

FRANK

What's up?

ED

Bart Pollock is here.

43.

VINCE

He's in Bandy's office.

FRANK

(unimpressed)

Yeah?

ED

Looks like he wants to talk to you.

JACK

Hey.   Keep my name out of it.

BANDY

(warm)

Frank. How are you? You know Bart

Pollock?

FRANK

Well, we've never met, but -

BART POLLOCK

Glad to know you Frank.

BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)

Speaking of production control?

BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)

Frank... This is a crackerjack.

They're just tickled to death in

Toledo.

44.

FRANK

You wouldn't have believed this

guy.

FRANK (CONT'D)

He's perfect Presidential material

in the worst sense. A million

dollar smile and about three pounds

of muscle between his ears.

(mimicking Pollock's

booming voice)

"Frank, this is a crackerjack."

APRIL

Wish I saw his face when you told

him you were leaving.

FRANK

...Horse's ass.

APRIL

I think this is them.

45.

MRS. GIVINGS

Sorry to be late.

APRIL

You're not late.

MRS. GIVINGS

The traffic was terrible.

MR. GIVINGS

Good to see you.

MRS. GIVINGS

Wasn't it terrible, Howard?

MR. GIVINGS

Route 12.

APRIL

You didn't have to do that.

FRANK

The time they finish that stretch

of road, they'll have to start all

over again.

APRIL

And you must be John?

MRS. GIVINGS

Say hello, John.

46.

JOHN

Nice to meetcha.   Heard a lot

aboutcha.

MRS. GIVINGS

Where are your darling children?

APRIL

They're at a birthday party.     Sorry

they couldn't be here.

JOHN

Don't worry. If I had a certified

lunatic coming around the house,

I'd probably get the kids out of

the way too.

MRS. GIVINGS

Oh, look at all this food! You

didn't have to go to any trouble

for us.

APRIL

It's just some sandwiches.

APRIL (CONT'D)

John, would you like a sandwich?

JOHN

Helen's been talking it up about

you people for months.

(MORE)

47.

JOHN (CONT'D)

The nice young Wheelers on

Revolutionary Road, the nice young

Revolutionaries on Wheeler road.

FRANK

Who'd like some sherry?

MRS. GIVINGS

Please, don't bother Frank.

JOHN

I'd like some sherry. And I'll

drink Helen's if she doesn't beat

me to it.

JOHN (CONT'D)

(suddenly serious)

But, hey... Listen, though. You

got a high-ball glass...? Put a

couple-three ice cubes in it, pour

it up to the brim. That's the way

I like it.

FRANK

I think I can do that.

MRS. GIVINGS

Oh, this is the most wonderful egg

salad, April. You must tell me how

you fix it.

JOHN

You a lawyer Frank?

FRANK

No, I'm not.

JOHN

I could use a lawyer.

48.

MR. GIVINGS

John, let's not get started again

about the lawyer.

JOHN

Pop, couldn't you just sit there

and eat your wonderful egg salad,

and quit horning in?

JOHN (CONT'D)

See, I've got a good many questions

to ask and I'm willing to pay for

the answers... Now, I don't need

to be told that a man who goes

after his mother with a coffee

table is putting himself in a weak

position legally; that's obvious.

MRS. GIVINGS

John, come and have a look out this

fabulous picture window.

JOHN

If he hits her with it and kills

her, that's a criminal case.

MRS. GIVINGS

Oh, look, the sun's coming out!

JOHN

If all he does is break the coffee

table and give her a certain amount

of aggravation and she decides to

go to court over it, that's a civil

case.

MRS. GIVINGS

Maybe we'll see a rainbow!   John,

come have a look.

49.

JOHN

Ma, how about doing everybody a

favor? How about shutting up!

MR. GIVINGS

Steady down, now.

FRANK

I can look into it.   Maybe

recommend someone.

JOHN

So, what do you do, Frank?

FRANK

I work for Knox Business Machines.

JOHN

You design the machines?

FRANK

Nope.

JOHN

Make `em, sell `em, repair `em?

MRS. GIVINGS

All these questions.

FRANK

I sort of help sell them, I guess.

I work in the office. Actually,

it's sort of a stupid job. I mean

there's nothing  you know,

interesting about it or anything.

MRS. GIVINGS

Oh, Frank...

JOHN

Whaddya do it for then?

50.

MR. GIVINGS

Maybe Frank doesn't want to be

questioned like this, son.

JOHN

Okay, okay, okay  I know it's none

of my business. And besides, I

know the answer. You want to play

house, you got to have a job. You

want to play very nice house, very

sweet house, then you got to have a

job you don't like. Anyone comes

along and asks "Whaddya do it for?'

he's probably on a four-hour pass

from the State funny farm. All

agreed...? Ma?

MR. GIVINGS

Sorry, Frank.

FRANK

Don't be. I agree with everything

you said, John. We both do.

That's why I'm quitting the job in

the fall and we're taking off.

APRIL

We're moving to Paris.

JOHN

Did you know about this, Ma...?

Wow. How do you feel about that,

Ma? The nice young Wheelers are

taking off!

51.

MRS. GIVINGS

...John, please.

MR. GIVINGS

Steady down, son.

FRANK

How about some fresh air, John?

FRANK (CONT'D)

If that's all right with you?

MRS. GIVINGS

I don't know if it's a good idea.

MR. GIVINGS

...If John wants to, I don't see

the harm.

APRIL

I hear you're a mathematician.

JOHN

You hear wrong.     It's all gone now.

APRIL

All gone?

JOHN

You know what electrical shock

treatments are?

52.

APRIL

Yes.   Yes I do.

JOHN

I've had thirty-seven.

JOHN (CONT'D)

See?

JOHN (CONT'D)

Supposed to jolt out the `Emotional

Problems.' Just jolted out the

mathematics.

APRIL

How awful.

JOHN

(mimicking)

`How awful...' Why, because

mathematics is so `interesting?'

APRIL

No. Because the shocks must be

awful and... well, because it's

awful not to be able to do what it

is you want to do. I think

mathematics are dull.

JOHN

I like your girl, Frank.

FRANK

Me too.

JOHN

So, what do a couple of people like

you have to run away from?

FRANK

We're not running.

53.

JOHN

And what's in Paris?

APRIL

A different way of life.

FRANK

So maybe we are running... We're

running from the hopeless emptiness

of the whole life here.

JOHN

The hopeless emptiness? Now,

you've said it. Plenty of people

are on to the emptiness, but it

takes real guts to see the

hopelessness... Wow.

APRIL

You know, he's the first person who

seemed to know what we were talking

about.

FRANK

That's true. Maybe we are just as

crazy as he is.

APRIL

If being crazy means living life as

if it matters then I don't care if

we are completely insane.

(beat)

Do you?

FRANK

No.

APRIL

I love you so much.

54.

BART POLLOCK

Tell you something, Frank. I'm a

little sore at Bandy for the way

he's kept you under a bushel all

these years. This place okay, for

you?

FRANK

This is just fine, sir.   Fine.

BART POLLOCK

One thing interests me, Frank, and

one thing only: selling the

electronic computer to the American

businessman...

BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)

That's why I'm assembling a team.

Men like you, not your average

salesmen... It'll mean more money,

and I got to be honest, maybe more

of a time commitment. But you'll

be part of something exciting,

Wheeler... Computers.

FRANK

Well, sir, it sounds exciting.

55.

BART POLLOCK

Bart!

FRANK

Bart...

FRANK (CONT'D)

Do you happen to remember an Earl

Wheeler?

FRANK (CONT'D)

Out of Yonkers?

BART POLLOCK

Can't say that I do. Relation of

yours?

FRANK

My father. He worked at Knox

almost twenty years.

BART POLLOCK

(thinking)

Earl Wheeler... Earl Wheeler...

FRANK

No reason you would have heard of

him.

BART POLLOCK

Well, I'm sure he was a good man.

FRANK

There's something I should have

mentioned earlier... I'm leaving

the firm. In the fall.

BART POLLOCK

Another outfit?

FRANK

No, it's not another outfit --

56.

BART POLLOCK

Now look, Frank. Is it a question

of money? Because if it is,

there's no reason we can't get

together on a satisfactory

FRANK

I appreciate that, but it's not

money. It's more of a personal

thing.

BART POLLOCK

A personal thing? I see.

(looks down, clearly

disapproving)

Frank... Let me tell you something

my father told me... A man only

gets a couple chances in life. If

he doesn't grab `em by the balls,

it won't be long before he finds

himself sitting around wondering

how he got to be second rate.

FRANK

I guess so.

BART POLLOCK

So, do me a favor... Sleep on it.

Discuss it with your wife. Because

let's face it: where the hell would

any of us be without our wives,

anyway?

BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)

And Frank, in all sincerity, if you

do decide to join us, I believe

it'll be a thing you'll never

regret.

(MORE)

57.

BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)

And I believe something else, too.

I believe it'd be a fine memorial

to your Dad.

FRANK

Knowing what you've got, comma,

knowing what you need, comma,

Knowing what you can do without,

dash. That's inventory control.

MAUREEN

Oh, hi Frank. Working late?

FRANK

I got to dig myself out here.

MAUREEN

I heard you were getting promoted.

MAUREEN (CONT'D)

Big shot. I guess your Dad would

have been real proud, huh?

FRANK

(surprised she remembered)

Huh. Yeah, I guess so...

MAUREEN

(smiles sweetly)

So...

(MORE)

58.

MAUREEN (CONT'D)

maybe I should buy you a drink or

something? You know...?

Celebrate.

FRANK

Yeah.   Maybe.

MAUREEN

I'll just get my coat.

JENNIFER

I'm going to take my doll carriage

and my bear and my three Easter

rabbits and my giraffe and all my

dolls and my doll house.

APRIL

I thought maybe we'd give the doll

house to Madeline.

JENNIFER

No! I don't want to give it to

Madeline.

59.

APRIL

I already explained to you, the big

things are going to be hard to

pack.

JENNIFER

But Madeline can have my bear and

my Easter rabbits -

APRIL

No! Just the big things. Look.

Wouldn't you rather go outside and

play with Michael.

JENNIFER

I don't feel like it.

APRIL

You've been inside all day.

JENNIFER

I don't feel like it!

APRIL

Well, I don't feel like explaining

everything fifteen times to

somebody who's too bored and silly

to listen!

FRANK

What's the matter?

APRIL

Nothing.

60.

FRANK

I don't believe you. Did something

happen today or what?

APRIL

Nothing happened today that I

haven't known about for days and

days.

FRANK

What?

APRIL

Oh God, Frank, please don't look so

dense. Do you mean you haven't

guessed or anything?

FRANK

What are you talking about?

APRIL

I'm pregnant, that's all.

FRANK

What...?   Jesus.

APRIL

Oh, Frank, I meant to wait until

dinner to tell you, but I just -

well, I've been pretty sure all

week and today I went to the Doctor

and now I can't even pretend it's

not true.

FRANK

(still stunned)

Jesus... How long?

APRIL

Ten weeks.

61.

FRANK

You didn't say anything.

APRIL

I thought... Oh, I don't know what

I thought.

APRIL (CONT'D)

I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.

FRANK

I know you are.

APRIL

We don't have to let this stop us.

There are things we can do.

Remember that girl at school I told

you about...? As long as you do it

before 12 weeks, it's fine.

APRIL (CONT'D)

We've got to be together in this,

Frank. Otherwise nothing's going

to make any sense.

FRANK

Okay.   We'll figure it out.

FRANK (CONT'D)

12 weeks.    So we have time.

APRIL

I love you Frank.

FRANK

...I love you too.

62.

SHEP

So, Frank, how's work?   They gonna

survive without you?

FRANK

Actually... Something kinda funny

happened the other day. I did some

dumb little piece of work to get

myself off the hook with Bandy, and

suddenly I'm The Bright Young Man.

SHEP

(laughs)

That's always the way, isn't it?

FRANK

It's incredible. I knocked this

thing off in a couple of minutes

and now they want me to join their

team of `specialist' salesmen.

SHEP

Morons.

FRANK

It'd be funny, if they weren't

talking about so much damn money.

63.

SHEP

(stealing a glance at

April)

So, you tempted?

FRANK

(shrugs)

Well, it's kind of ironic, don't

you think?

SHEP

She okay?

APRIL

I thought you turned the job down?

FRANK

(shrugs)

Not yet... It's just an option,

that's all. With the money they're

talking, things could be different

for us here. We could get a better

place. Travel.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Look, the point is - we could be

happy here. At least for a while.

64.

FRANK (CONT'D)

It is possible that Parisians

aren't the only ones who know how

to lead interesting lives, April.

APRIL

So you've made up your mind?

FRANK

No.   Like I said, it's an option.

APRIL

...And supposing you're right. You

make all this money and we have

this interesting life here. Won't

you still be wasting your life

toiling away at a job you find

ridiculous? Just like your father.

FRANK

(sharp)

Maybe we let that be my business.

APRIL

(incredulous)

Your business?

FRANK

(exhales)

It's too hot for this.    I'm going

to get wet.

65.

APRIL

You don't want to go, do you?

FRANK

Come on, April.   Of course I do.

APRIL

You don't! Because you've never

tried at anything. And if you

don't try at anything you can't

fail.

FRANK

What the hell do you    mean I don't

try? I support you,     don't I? I

pay for this house.     I work ten

hours a day at a job    I can't stand.

APRIL

You don't have to!

FRANK

Bullshit! I'm not happy about it.

But I have the backbone not to run

away from my responsibilities!

APRIL

It takes backbone to lead the life

you want, Frank.

APRIL (CONT'D)

Where are you going?

FRANK

Is it alright with you if I go to

the bathroom?

66.

FRANK

What the hell are you going to do

with this?

APRIL

And what do you think you're going

to do? You're going to stop me?

FRANK

You're damn right!

APRIL

Go ahead and try!

FRANK

Listen. Listen to me. You do this

- you do this and I swear to God

I'll -

APRIL

You'll what? You'll leave me?   Is

that a threat, or a promise?

FRANK

When did you buy this, April?   I

want to know!

67.

APRIL

You know you really are being

melodramatic about the whole thing.

As long as it's done in the first

twelve weeks, it's perfectly safe.

FRANK

That's now April!   Don't I get a

say?

APRIL

Of course you do! It would be for

you, Frank, don't you see? So you

can have time. Like we talked

about.

FRANK

How can it be for me if the thought

makes my stomach turn over?

APRIL

Then it's for me... Tell me we can

have the baby in Paris, Frank. But

don't make me stay here. Please.

FRANK

We can't have the baby in Paris.

APRIL

Why not? I don't need everything

we have here. I don't care where

we live! I mean who made these

rules, anyway? The only reason we

moved out here was because I got

pregnant. Then we had another

child to prove the first one wasn't

a mistake. I mean how long does it

go on?

APRIL (CONT'D)

Frank. Do you actually want

another child? Well, do you?

68.

APRIL (CONT'D)

Come on, tell me. Tell me the

truth, Frank. Remember that? We

used to live by it. You know what's

so good about the truth? Everyone

knows what it is, however long

they've lived without it. No one

forgets the truth, Frank, they just

get better at lying. So tell me: do

you really want another child?

FRANK

All I know is what I feel. And

anyone else in their right mind

would feel the same way.

APRIL

(quiet)

But I've had two children.    Doesn't

that count in my favor?

FRANK

Christ! The fact that you even put

it that way! You make it sound

like having children is a

punishment.

APRIL

I love my children.

FRANK

And you're sure about that?

APRIL

What the hell is that supposed to

mean?

FRANK

April, you just said our daughter

was mistake. How do I know you

didn't try to get rid of her, or

Michael for that matter? How do I

know you didn't try to flush our

entire fucking family down the

toilet?

69.

APRIL

No that's not true. Of course I

didn't.

FRANK

But how do I know April?

APRIL

Stop.   Please just stop, Frank.

FRANK

April, a normal woman, a normal

sane mother doesn't buy herself a

piece of rubber tubing to give

herself an abortion so she can, go

live out some God damn fantasy.

FRANK (CONT'D)

(sober)

All I'm saying is you don't seem

entirely rational about this

thing... And maybe we should get

someone to help you think about it.

APRIL

...And the new job's going to pay

for that too?

FRANK

April if you need a shrink, it'll

be paid for. Obviously.

APRIL

...Okay. I guess there isn't much

more to say, then, is there?

APRIL (CONT'D)

So I guess Paris was a pretty

childish idea, huh?

70.

FRANK

I guess maybe it was.

FRANK (CONT'D)

We can be happy here April...   I

can make you happy here.

FRANK (CONT'D)

We've had a great few months.   It

doesn't have to end...

FRANK (CONT'D)

We're going to be okay.

APRIL

I hope so Frank.   I really hope so.

RECEPTIONIST

Thank you for waiting.   Mr. Pollock

can see you now.

71.

JACK (O.S)

Foiled by faulty contraception.

ED

I can't say I'm sorry.

VINCE

Wouldn't have been the same without

you.

JACK

You'd have been sorely missed in

the old cubicle, I can tell you

that.

JACK (CONT'D)

Besides which...

FRANK

What?

JACK

...Well, the plan always seemed a

touch unrealistic, don't you think?

72.

JACK (CONT'D)

I suppose, it's none of my

business, really.

FRANK

No.   I suppose it isn't.

JACK

Well, we won't be the only ones

glad to hear the news. They'll be

celebrating in the secretarial

pool.

MILLY

Hey! Remember the first time you

brought us here? You said, it

takes a special kind of taste to

enjoy Vito's Log Cabin!

73.

SHEP

It's so awful it's kinda nice!

MILLY

That's right!

MILLY (CONT'D)

(dabs at her eyes)

Look at me...! I'm just so happy.

Our little gang's back together

again!

SHEP

At least Europe's not going

anywhere.

FRANK

Wanna dance?

APRIL

I don't really feel like it.

MILLY

I'll dance!

MILLY (CONT'D)

(tipsy)

Guess April's pretty blue `bout

Paris, huh?

FRANK

Think she'll be okay?

MILLY

Oh, sure. Give us girls a couple

of days and we can get over

anything!

74.

MILLY (CONT'D)

...Frank.

MILLY (CONT'D)

Frank... I...

FRANK

(sudden remorse)

You okay?

MILLY

Gee...I'm afraid I'm not very...

SHEP

Of all the inconsiderate...

75.

APRIL

Look - why don't you take Milly

home, then go home yourself and

that would take care of both

sitters. Then Shep can take me

home later.

SHEP

All right with me.

FRANK

(to April)

You'll be alright?

APRIL

Sure.

SHEP

I'm sorry you're not going away

anymore. I know it was important to

you.

SHEP (CONT'D)

Don't take this wrong; I've been

there and...they don't have so much

we don't have here.

APRIL

It didn't have to be Paris.

SHEP

You just wanted out, huh?

76.

APRIL

I wanted in. I just wanted us to

live again.

APRIL (CONT'D)

For years I thought we shared a

secret...that we would be wonderful

in the world. I didn't exactly know

how, but just the

possibility...kept me hoping.

APRIL (CONT'D)

How pathetic is that? To put all

your hopes in a promise that was

never made? See, Frank knows...he

knows what he wants. He's found his

place. He's just fine. Married, two

kids. It should be enough. It is

for him. He's right; we were never

special or destined or anything at

all.

SHEP

Sure you are. You're The Wheelers.

You're a terrific couple, everyone

says so.

APRIL

I saw a different life. I can't

stop seeing it.

(beat)

Can't leave, can't stay.

(beat)

No damn use to anyone.

APRIL (CONT'D)

Come on, let's do it.

77.

SHEP

Let me take you somewhere.

APRIL

No. Please. Here.    Now.    In the

back seat.

SHEP (CONT'D)

April... This is what I've always

wanted... I love you.

APRIL

Don't say that.

SHEP

I mean it, I love you.

APRIL

Please, just be quiet for a minute,

then you can take me home.

78.

FRANK

It's beautiful out.

APRIL

Yes; it's lovely.

FRANK

You know what today is?

FRANK (CONT'D)

It's twelve weeks.

APRIL

That's right.

FRANK

Look, this has been kind of a crazy

summer. We've both been under a

strain. I mean I know you're

upset.

APRIL

You know I'm not sleeping with you

and you want to know why?

79.

APRIL (CONT'D)

Well, I'm sorry Frank, but I don't

really feel like talking about it.

FRANK

Okay. What do you feel like

talking about?

APRIL

Would it be all right if we didn't

talk about anything? Can't we just

take each day as it comes, and do

the best we can, and not feel we

have to talk about everything all

the time?

FRANK

I don't think I suggested we talk

about everything all the time. My

point was, we've both been under a

strain and we ought to be trying to

help each other as much as we can

right now.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I mean God knows my own behavior

has been pretty weird lately... I

mean, as it happens... there is

actually something I'd like to tell

you about...

FRANK (CONT'D)

I've been with a girl in the city a

few times.

80.

FRANK (CONT'D)

A girl I hardly even know. It was

nothing to me, but she got a little

carried away. She's just a kid...

Anyway, it's over now. It's really

over. If I weren't sure of that I

guess I could never have told you

about it.

APRIL

Why did you?

FRANK

(relieved)

Baby, I don't know. I think it was

a simple case of wanting to be a

man again after all that abortion

business. Some kind of neurotic,

irrational need to prove something.

APRIL

No. I don't mean why did you have

the girl; I mean why did you tell

me about it?

APRIL (CONT'D)

I mean what's the point? Is it

supposed to make me jealous, or

something? Is it supposed to make

me fall in love with you, or back

into bed with you, or what? I mean

what am I supposed to say?

FRANK

Why don't you say what you feel?

APRIL

I don't feel anything.

FRANK

In other words you don't care what

I do or who I fuck or anything?

81.

APRIL

No; I guess that's right; I don't.

APRIL (CONT'D)

Fuck who you like.

FRANK

Don't you see...Don't you see, I

want you to care.

APRIL

Oh, I know you do. And I suppose I

would if I loved you. But you see

I don't think I do anymore. And I

only just figured that out. And

that's why I'd just as soon not do

any talking right now.

FRANK

Oh, now don't give me this shit!

You know God damn well you love me!

APRIL

You think so?!

FRANK

You know GOD DAMN WELL!

MRS. GIVINGS (O.S.)

Yoo-hoo!   Any one home?

APRIL

I'm sorry dinner's late. Can I get

anyone a refill?

82.

MRS. GIVINGS

Oh, don't worry. It's nice just to

sit for a bit and socialize...You

really didn't need to go through

all the trouble of cooking. I can

see you have a lot to do with

packing and what not.

FRANK

Actually, there's been a change of

plans.

MRS. GIVINGS

Oh?

FRANK

I thought maybe it was obvious...

April's pregnant.

MRS. GIVINGS

Oh, April! I can't tell you how

pleased I am. Oh, but I expect

you'll be needing a bigger house,

now, won't you?

JOHN

Hold it a second, Ma.

JOHN (CONT'D)

I don't get this.

JOHN (CONT'D)

What's so obvious about it? I mean

okay, she's pregnant; so what?

Don't people have babies in Europe?

83.

MRS. GIVINGS

Oh John, really. I don't think we

need to --

JOHN

I'm asking the man a question. If

he doesn't want to give me the

answer, I'm assuming he'll have

sense enough to tell me so.

FRANK

Suppose we just say that people

anywhere aren't very well advised

to have babies unless they can

afford them.

JOHN

(nods slowly)

Okay. Okay; it's a question of

money. Money's always a good

reason...

JOHN (CONT'D)

But it's hardly ever the real

reason. What's the real reason?

Wife talk you out of it, or what?

JOHN (CONT'D)

Little woman decide she isn't quite

ready to quit playing house?

JOHN (CONT'D)

Nah, nah, that's not it. I can

tell. She looks too tough. Tough

and female and adequate as hell.

84.

JOHN (CONT'D)

Okay, then; it must've been you.

JOHN (CONT'D)

What happened?

MRS. GIVINGS

John, please, you're being very --

JOHN

What happened, Frank? You get cold

feet, or what? You decide you're

better off here after all? You

figure it's more comfy here in the

old Hopeless Emptiness after all,

or --

JOHN (CONT'D)

Wow, that did it! Look at his

face! What's the matter, Wheeler?

Am I getting warm?

MR. GIVINGS (CONT'D)

All right, son. I think we'd

better be --

JOHN

Boy!

JOHN (CONT'D)

Boy! You know something? I

wouldn't be surprised if you

knocked her up on purpose just so

you could spend the rest of your

life hiding behind that maternity

dress. That way you never have to

find out what he's made of.

85.

FRANK

Now look, I think that's just about

enough out of you. I mean, who the

hell do you think you are? You

come in here and say whatever crazy

God damn thing comes into your head

and I think it's about time someone

told you to keep your God damn -

MRS. GIVINGS

He's not well, Frank.

FRANK

Not well, my ass! I don't give a

damn if he's sick or well or dead

or alive, he should keep his

fucking opinions in the fucking

insane asylum where they belong!

MR. GIVINGS

Let's go, son.

JOHN

Big man you got there, April.

JOHN (CONT'D)

Big family man, solid citizen. I

feel sorry for you. Still, maybe

you deserve each other.

JOHN (CONT'D)

Matter of fact, the way you look

right now, I'm beginning to feel

sorry for him, too. I mean, you

must give him a pretty bad time, if

making babies is the only way he

can prove he's got a pair of balls.

86.

FRANK

You... fucking..!

MRS. GIVINGS

He's not well, Frank!

MR. GIVINGS

All right, John. Let's get on out

to the car now.

MRS. GIVINGS

I'm sorry April, I'm so sorry...

JOHN

Right... Sorry, sorry, sorry!

Okay Ma? Have I said `Sorry'

enough times? I am sorry, too.

Damn; I bet I'm just about the

sorriest bastard I know. Course,

get right down to it, I don't have

a whole hell of a lot to be glad

about, do I?

JOHN (CONT'D)

Hey, but I'm glad about one thing,

though.

JOHN (CONT'D)

You know what I'm glad about? I'm

glad I'm not gonna be that kid.

87.

FRANK

Okay, okay, don't tell me. Don't

tell me; let me guess. I made a

Disgusting Spectacle of Myself.

Right?

APRIL

Right.

FRANK

And everything that man said is

True. Right? Isn't that what

you're going to say?

APRIL

Apparently I don't have to.     You're

saying it for me.

FRANK

But you're wrong.

APRIL

Why am I wrong?

FRANK

Because the man is insane. He's

fucking insane! Do you know what

the definition of insanity is?

APRIL

What is it, Frank?

FRANK

The inability to relate to another

human being. It's the inability to

love.

APRIL

The in -- the in; the inabil; the

inability to --

88.

APRIL (CONT'D)

Oh. -- Oh, Frank, you really are a

wonderful talker! If black could

be made into white by talking,

you'd be the man for the job. So

now I'm crazy because I don't love

you -- right? Is that the point?

FRANK

No. Wrong. You're not crazy and

you do love me; that's the point.

APRIL

But I don't. In fact I loathe the

sight of you. You're just a boy who

made me laugh at a party once and

if you come any closer, if you

touch me or anything I think I'll

scream.

FRANK

Oh baby listen --

FRANK (CONT'D)

Fuck you, April. And fuck all your

hateful, snotty little -

89.

APRIL

What're you going to do now? Are

you going to hit me? To show how

much you love me?

FRANK

Oh, no, don't worry, I can't be

bothered! You're not worth the

trouble it'd take to hit you.

You're not worth the powder it'd

take to blow you up. You're an

empty --

FRANK (CONT'D)

You're an empty, hollow fucking

shell of a woman. What the hell

are you living in my house for if

you hate me so much? Huh? Will

you answer me that? Why the hell

do you fuck me? What the hell are

you carrying my child for?

FRANK (CONT'D)

Why the hell didn't you just get

rid of it, when you had the chance?

Because listen. Listen: I got news

for you. I wish to God you had.

90.

APRIL

Don't come any closer.

FRANK

April, listen, I --

APRIL

Don't come any closer. Can't I

even get away from you in the

fucking woods?

FRANK

April, listen, I didn't mean that.

Honestly; I didn't mean what I

said.

91.

APRIL

Are you still talking? Isn't there

any way to stop your talking? I

NEED to think. Can't you see that?

FRANK

Please come back.     What're you

doing out here?

APRIL

Do you want me to scream again,

Frank? Because I will, if you say

another word! I mean it!

92.

APRIL

Good morning.

FRANK

Good morning.

APRIL

Would you like scrambled eggs or

fried?

FRANK

Oh. It doesn't really matter -

Uh... scrambled, I guess, if it's

easy.

APRIL

Fine.   I'll have scrambled too.

93.

FRANK

It's kinda nice having breakfast

without the kids for a change.

APRIL

Yes. I thought you'd probably want

a good breakfast today. I mean it's

kind of an important day for you,

isn't it? Isn't this the day you

have your conference with Pollock?

FRANK

(surprised)

Yes. That's right, yes.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Big deal.

APRIL

I imagine it is a pretty big deal;

for them, anyway. What exactly do

you think you'll be doing? You

never have told me much about it.

FRANK

Haven't I? Well... I think this

whole thing is about Knox getting

ready to buy up one of these really

big computers, bigger than the

`500'. Did I tell you about that?

APRIL

No, I don't believe you did.

94.

FRANK

Well, you know -- Basically it's

just a...a big, fast adding

machine. Only...

FRANK (CONT'D)

Instead of mechanical parts, you

see, it's got thousands of little

individual vacuum tubes.

APRIL

Oh, I see. At least I think I see;

yes. It's really sort of --

interesting, isn't it?

FRANK

Well, I don't know, it's -- yeah, I

guess it is sort of interesting, in

a way.

APRIL

You should value what you do Frank.

You're obviously good at it.

FRANK

Guess I'd better be getting

started.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Listen, though, April; this was

really nice... I mean it was a

swell breakfast. Really; I don't

know when I've ever had a -- a

nicer breakfast.

95.

APRIL

Thank you... I'm glad; I enjoyed it

too.

FRANK

Then you don't -- You don't hate

me, or anything?

APRIL

No; of course I don't.

APRIL (CONT'D)

Have a good day.

FRANK

Okay, then... So long.

96.

APRIL

Hello... Milly? Everything all

right? My voice sounds what...?

APRIL (CONT'D)

Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not

feeling any better... If it's not

an inconvenience for you... This

evening would be great. What...?

Oh, well- no, not if they're

outdoors playing. Don't call them

in.

APRIL (CONT'D)

Just give them - you know, give

them each a kiss for me, and give

them my love, and tell them - you

know... All right, Milly. Thanks.

97.

98.

APRIL (O.S.)

I think I need an ambulance....

Yes... One one five Revolutionary

Road.

SHEP

Frank? They tell you what

happened?

99.

FRANK

Jesus, Shep. I couldn't even

understand half the things he told

me. He said the fetus was out

before they got her here. He said

they had to operate to take out the

whatdycallit, the placenta and now

she's still bleeding. He said

she'd lost a lot of blood before

the ambulance came, and now they're

trying to stop it, and he said a

whole lot of things I didn't get,

about capillaries, and he said

she's unconscious. Jesus.

SHEP

How about sitting down, Frank.

FRANK

What the hell do I want to sit down

for!

SHEP

Okay.   Take it easy.

FRANK

My God.

SHEP

Here, have a cigarette.

FRANK

She did it to herself, Shep.

FRANK (CONT'D)

She did it to herself.

SHEP

I'll get some coffee.

100.

FRANK

No.   No.   No.

DOCTOR

Try to sit down, Mr. Wheeler.

SHEP

Sit down Frank.

101.

MILLY

...It was the worst experience of

my life. Such wonderful people.

Weren't they Shep? Poor April.

MILLY (CONT'D)

Frank lives in the city now.       Where

is it he works?

SHEP

Bart Pollock Associates.

MR. BRACE

Computers.     Interesting firm.

MRS. BRACE

Have you seen him since?

MILLY

No. Too many memories, I think.

Shep's seen him. In the city.

102.

MILLY (CONT'D)

He's just dedicated to those kids.

Every spare moment he has, he

spends with them...

MILLY

You okay?

SHEP

Mm-hmm.

SHEP (CONT'D)

I don't want to talk about The

Wheelers any more.

MILLY

Okay. We don't have to.     We don't

have to.

103.

MRS. GIVINGS

I can't tell you how pleased I am

about the little Revolutionary Road

place, Howard. Remember how dreary

it looked all winter? All cold and

dark and -- well, spooky. Creepy-

crawly. And now whenever I drive

past, it gives me such a lift to

see it all perked up and spanking

clean again, with lights in the

windows. And do you know, I was

just thinking, I've loved that

little house for years, and the

Braces are the first really

suitable people I've ever found for

it. Really nice, congenial people,

I mean.

MR. GIVINGS

Well, except for the Wheelers, you

mean.

MRS. GIVINGS

Oh, I was very fond of the Wheelers

but they always were a bit -- a bit

whimsical, for my taste. A bit

neurotic. I may not have stressed

it, but they were often very trying

people to deal with, in many ways.

(MORE)

104.

MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)

Actually, the main reason the

little house has been so hard to

sell is that they let it depreciate

so dreadfully. Warped window

frames, wet cellar, crayon marks on

the walls, filthy smudges around

all the--

FADE TO BLACK
