MODERATOR

Tonight we'll discuss a subject

most of us seem to consider either

bad taste or frivolous or funny.

But if our experts are right, we

face what might be called a

masculinity crisis. Every fourth

American man uptight, threatened by

the increasing sexual demands of

American women...

IRATE WOMAN

They always put it that way, but

well, all it means, you know, is

every fourth American woman's never

satisfied. That's it. I never am --

have been, you know...

COOL WOMAN

This, this image of the, the man

eating woman. It isn't our

increasing demands. I think it's

the shrinking American male...

SAD WOMAN

No, I never had, well, whatever it

is you call it. But the hours he

works, I can't blame him...

SAD WOMAN'S VOICE

... but it's a problem. A big

problem. With so many women I

know...

LADY COMMENTATOR

Before World War One -- American

men outnumbered women by over six

percent. Today American women not

only outnumber men, but live five

years longer -- leaving them in

control of vast corporate wealth

and seventy-five percent of

America's purchasing power...

JOE

Y'all,line up and take your turn...

MODERATOR

My question is this -- will

American know-how come up with a

marketable male to replace all the

men who are worrying themselves

into an early grave over women's

increasing sexual demands?

WAITRESS

Where's that Joe Buck?

RALPH

Where's that Joe Buck?

JOE

Yeah, where's that Joe Buck?

SALLY BUCK

You look real nice, Joe baby...

MANAGER

Where's that Joe Buck?

JOE

Yeah, where's that Joe Buck?

MANAGER

You're due here at four o'clock.

Look at those dishes, look!

JOE

Know what you can do with those

dishes? And if you ain't man enough

to do it yourself, I'd be happy to

oblige...

MANAGER

Four to midnight, understand?

JOE

Say, look, uh, I gotta have a word

with you, if you got a second.

MANAGER

Later. Later maybe.

RALPH

You ain't coming to work?

JOE

Don't guess. Just come for my day's

pay owing and to tell you I'm

heading East.

WAITRESS

Cups!

RALPH

What you gonna do back there, East?

JOE

Lotta rich women back there...

RALPH

Yeah?

JOE

Men, they mostly faggots.

RALPH

Must be some mess back there.

JOE

Well, ain't no use hanging around

here.

RALPH

Ain't gonna collect your pay?

JOE

I got me two hundred twenty-four

bucks of flat folding money...

(slaps hip)

He know what he can do with that

chicken-shit day's pay. And if he

ain't man enough to do it for

himself, I be happy to oblige!

JOE

Tough tiddy, ladies, you had your

chance.

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE

Benson and Hedges One Hundreds

JOE

Care to get out your yardstick,

gentlemen?

JOE

This is a powerful mothah, ain't

it?

PALE BLONDE

Do you have a stick of gum?

PALE BLONDE (CONT'D)

Thank you.

JOE

Plenty more where that came from.

PALE BLONDE

Thank you, no, it's just till the

Dramamine works. I get carsick.

JOE

I only get carsick on boats.

(waits, then)

But seems to me that's more the

fish smell than the bouncing...

SALLY BUCK

No, a little lower, sugar, yeah,

yeah, that's good. Grammaw's beat.

SALESMAN'S VOICE

You gotta sell yourself, that's the

whole trick...

SALESMAN

It ain't the product and it ain't

the price, no sir, and it ain't

what you sell, it's personality,

pure and simple. I ain't shined my

own shoes or shaved my own face in

forty years, how's that? Not bad

for a kid that didn't pass the

eighth grade, right?

JOE

Yeah, hell, yeah.

SALESMAN

And that's my golden rule. Make 'em

love you. Put yourself over and you

can sell them anything. If they

like you, they'll buy horsemeat for

prime beef...

SALLY BUCK

You get him to the church, honey.

He ain't gonna find out you ain't a

real blonde till after you're

married, then's too late.

SALLY BUCK (CONT'D)

You getting too big for your

britches, sugar.

SALLY BUCK'S VOICE

Don't forget to say your prayers,

honey...

OLD LADY

I want it on.

EVANGELIST'S VOICE

Oh, my friends, I say unto you,

invest with Jesus, put your dollars

to work where they'll pay off at

compound interest. The Good Book

says money answereth all things...

JOE

Light?

EVANGELIST'S VOICE

... everyone who sends a dollar to

the Evangelical Congregation of the

Air will get free gratis a genuine

leatherette hymn book so you can

sing along with Sister Rosella and

the Evangelical Choir...

JOE

You throw in Sister Rosella and you

got a deal, right, old timer?

JOE (CONT'D)

Going far?

OLD COWHAND

Up the line. Not far.

JOE

I'm bound for New York City.

JOE (CONT'D)

Ever happen to come across a cowman

name of Woodsy Niles? Friend of my

grammaw Sally Buck...

SALLY BUCK

Like it, honey? Does it fit?

WOODSY

You do me good, Sal, you do me real

good. You know what I gonna give

you for that Stetson?

SALLY BUCK

Woodsy Niles! The boy!

WOODSY

He don't know what makes little

apples by now, it's time he found

out.

JOE

Smoke?

WOODSY

... git along little dogies!

JOE

Nice talking to you, old timer.

WOODSY'S VOICE

She-dogs squat, boy. He-dogs stand

up and lift their leg...

WOODSY

MARINE

VETERAN

MARINE

JOE

Fort Benning, Georgia.

MARINE

JOE

Kee-rist...

PROSTITUTE

Hey, hey, what you try to do to me?

SALLY BUCK

Keep your meat hooks off my

operators, sugar, hear?

ANASTASIA

You're the only one, Joe, the only,

only one ever!

JOE'S REFLECTION

Gonna swing my lasso and rope that

whole goddam island, yeah!

SALLY BUCK'S VOICE

There's a TV dinner in the fridge,

lover boy...

SALLY BUCK

You be okay, won't you? Maybe I

bring you a treat if you're a good

boy...

SALLY BUCK

I'm so beat, no point you waiting

round, toots, think I'll stop in

for a beer or two...

SALLY BUCK

Expect me when you see me. Looks

like I got me a new beau, lover

boy, how's that for an old grammaw?

I'll leave you movie money...

JOE

Up yours, lady.

RALPH

Hell, he know I can't read...

JOE'S VOICE

After all them dishes are washed,

JOE'S REFLECTION

Then they bring some more dishes

and I wash them and then I, uh,

sleep some and then wash some more

dishes and then I...

JOE'S VOICE

Say it, lover boy!

JOE'S REFLECTION

Die.

JOE'S VOICE

Well, you better just shake your

tail, lover boy, and root, hog or

die.

JOE

Goddam if I came to this town to

write postcards.

JOE

Beg pardon, ma'am, I'm new here in

town, just in from Houston, Texas,

and looking for the Statue of

Liberty.

RICH LADY

Were you looking? About the Statue

of Liberty?

JOE

Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean

business!

RICH LADY

I'm sorry. I thought you were --

never mind -- I've never actually

been there, but let me see, you

take the Seventh Avenue subway, I

think, to the end of the line...

JOE

You sure are a pretty lady.

RICH LADY

You're not looking for the Statue

of Liberty at all.

JOE

No, ma'am, I'm not.

RICH LADY

Why, that's perfectly dreadful.

Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

CASS'S VOICE

Hurry up, Baby. Do um goody-goods

for Mama.

JOE

Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand

spanking new to this town, come

from Houston, Texas, and hoping to

get a look at the Statue of

Liberty...

CASS

You're hoping to get a look at

what?

JOE

The Statue of Liberty.

CASS

It's up in Central Park, taking a

leak. If you hurry, you'll make the

supper show. Now get lost.

CASS

Hi.

CASS

Hello?

CASS (CONT'D)

Morey? Hi-ee, honey...

CASS (CONT'D)

I'm just out of breath, honey,

running to catch the phone.

CASS (CONT'D)

I was walking Baby. Him got to do

CASS (CONT'D)

Oh God, oh stop. I can't stand

that. I just die...

(quickly into phone)

It's Baby, Morey. Him trying to say

hello. Say hello to Morey, Baby.

CASS (CONT'D)

Okay, old goosie? Now lookie, when

do you want me to meet you?

Whatever you say. I'll take a nap,

Okay, but just one, a big wet one.

CASS

JOE'S VOICE

Holy shee-it, this is a goddam

penthouse you got here, Cass, a

real goddam penthouse.

CASS'S VOICE

Don't look, baby...

JOE

Say, Cass, I, uh, sure have enjoyed

being here. Believe it's as fine a

time as I've had in my life!

CASS'S VOICE

Me, too, lover.

JOE

That's good, it is, cause, well I

guess I didn't tell you why I came

to New York, did I?

CASS

Zip this thing, will you, Tex?

JOB

Truth is, Cass, I'm, well, I'm in

business.

CASS

Oh, poor you. Morey's got terrible

ulcers.

JOE

Don't know what line Morey's in,

but myself now, fact is -- I'm a

hustler.

CASS

(lips stretched)

Hers'n zodda meg a livig.

JOE

Beg pardon, ma'am?

CASS

Said, a person's gotta make a

living.

JOE

You sure you heard what I said?

CASS

Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half

here. Maybe you oughta run on

along. But why don't you take this

phone number?

CASS (CONT'D)

Darn! I didn't get to the bank --

Tex -- could you let me have a

little coin for the taxi-waxi?

CASS (CONT'D)

You're such a doll. I hate money,

don't you? God, it's been fun.

JOE

Funny thing, you mentioning money.

I was just about to ask your for

some...

CASS

You bastard! You son of a bitch!

You think you're dealing with some

old slut? Look at me! You think

just cause you're a longhorn bull

you can get away with this crap?

Well, you're out of your mind. I am

a gorgeous chick, thirty-one,

that's right, you said it!

JOE

Hey. Hey, Cass. Did you think I

meant that? Christ, would I be

asking you for money with a wad

like that riding on my hip?

JOE (CONT'D)

Hey. You are a gorgeous-looking

piece, Cass. Guy gets horny, just

looking at you. It's a fact. How

much you need for that taxi? Ten?

Twenty? There you go.

RATSO'S VOICE

Excuse me, I'm just admiring that

colossal shirt...

RATSO

That is one hell of a shirt. I bet

you paid a pretty price for it, am

I right?

JOE

Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah,

I'd say this was an all right

shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know,

have a lot of cheap stuff on my

back.

JACKIE

Got a cigarette, cowboy?

RATSO

(a stage whisper)

More goddam faggots in this town.

JOE

Shee-it...

(shakes his head)

Kee-rist, you really know the

ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into

you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas

and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what

do you say to that?

RATSO

Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't

mind if I do.

JOE

(slaps bar)

Same all around! For my friend,

too!

TV HOST

... and for the losers, who don't

get the girl, we'll give as

consolation prices -- a six month

supply of underarm deodorant...

JOE

... you see what I'm getting at

here? She got a penthouse up there

with color TV and more goddam

diamonds than an archbishop and she

busts out bawling when I ask for

money!

RATSO

For what?

JOE

For money.

RATSO

For money for what?

JOE

I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you

know that?

RATSO

How would I know? You gotta tell a

person these things

(shakes his head)

A hustler? Picking up trade on the

street like that -- baby, believe

me -- you need management.

JOE

I think you just put your finger on

it, I do.

RATSO

My friend O'Daniel. That's who you

need. Operates the biggest stable

in town. In the whole goddam

metropolitan area. A stud like you

- paying! -- not that I blame you --

a dame starts crying, I cut my

heart for her...

JACKIE'S VOICE

I'd call that a very minor

operation...

JACKIE

... in fact, you just sit comfy and

I'll cut it out with my fingernail

file. You won't even need Blue

Cross, Ratso.

RATSO

The name is Rizzo.

JACKIE

That's what I said, Ratso.

JOE

(suddenly)

Hey now, you heard him.

TV DATE GIRL

I pick Number Two! He's cool!

RATSO

That's okay, Joe. I'm used to these

types that like to pick on

cripples. Sewers're full of 'em.

JACKIE

May I ask one thing, cowboy? If you

sit there and he sits way over

there, how's he gonna get his hand

into your pocket? But I'm sure he

has that all figured out...

(to Ratso)

Good night, sweets.

TV HOST

May present your chosen mate!

RATSO

Look, with these chicks that want

to buy it, most of 'em are older,

dignified, right? Social register

types. They can't be trotting down

to Times Square to pick out the

merchandise. They need a middleman,

right? That's O'Daniel.

RATSO (CONT'D)

It is a crime, a stud like you

passing out double sawbucks to a

chick like that. With proper

management you should be taking

home fifty, a hundred bucks a day.

More if you wanta moonlight...

RATSO

Him I placed with O'Daniel just two

weeks ago. And look. Not much of a

stud either, what I hear...

JOE

Hey, listen, how about you take me

to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird

right now?

RATSO

Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and

I'd be doing you both a favor, but

why? What'm I dragging my bum leg

all over town for? It's no picnic

and what for, for me myself, what?

RATSO (CONT'D)

Tomorrow when some piece like

that's scratching your back in a

Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll

your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.

JOE

Hold it, just hold it. You think

I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name

your cut, whatever you want, you

got it right now. Five? Ten, how's

that?

RATSO

Joe, please. You know what I'd ask

anyone else? Oh hell, tell you what

I'll do, I'll take the ten...

(he does)

... but when I hand you over to Mr.

O'Daniel, I'll have to have another

ten, Joe; just to like cover

expenses...

RATSO

This boy is just your meat, Mr.

O'Daniel, believe it, I'm telling

you -- what? -- Enrico Rizzo from

the Bronx. The point is he needs

you. Right now. Tonight...

(aside to Joe)

I got his tongue hanging out...

RATSO'S VOICE

Name's Joe Buck. Cowboy. Just in

from Texas, don't know the ropes,

new to the city, but very promising

material, sir, and ready, if you

get what I mean. Fabulous. Right

away. What's that room number there

again?

RATSO

Hold it a second...

RATSO (CONT'D)

Nine-oh-one, got it?

RATSO (CONT'D)

Let's see how you look. Fine. You

look fine. Now I'm gonna have to

have that other ten...

JOE

(digs in wallet)

Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take

that...

RATSO

Oh hell, forget it.

JOE

Now take it. Go on.

(gives it to him)

Listen, where can I reach you?

Cause I'm gonna make this right

with you soon's I get me set up...

RATSO

Forget it.

JOE

I mean, dammit, where you live?

RATSO

Sherry-Netherlands Hotel. Now get

your ass in there. He's waiting!

O'DANIEL

You must be Joe Buck. Come in.

O'DANIEL (CONT'D)

Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come

on in and let's get a look at you.

Turn around. Good strong back.

You'll need it. So you want help --

take a seat, relax, tell me about

yourself. Cowboy, huh?

JOE

No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but

I'm a first class stud.

O'DANIEL

Take it,easy, boy...

(laughs)

Seems to me you're different than a

lotta boys that come to me. Most of

'em seem troubled, confused, but

I'd say you knew exactly what you

want.

JOE

You bet I do, sir.

O'DANIEL

But I'll bet you got one thing in

common with them other boys. I'll

bet you're lonesome.

JOE

Well, not too, I mean, a little.

O'DANIEL

I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a

drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope

fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief,

a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop,

I say, poop! I've heard it all and

I'm sick of it, sick to death.

JOE

Yessir, I can see that.

O'DANIEL

Lonesomeness is something you take.

You bear? Dammit, you take it and

go about your business, that's all.

JOE

Well, uh, I'm raring to go.

O'DANIEL

Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy,

huh?

JOE

Uh, yessir.

O'DANIEL

Ready for hard work, son?

JOE

Ready for anything.

O'DANIEL

I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna

be easier for you than most.

JOE

Gonna be like money from home.

O'DANIEL

Money from home, see, there's your

strength, you put things in earthy

terms any man can understand, son.

I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm

gonna run you ragged!

O'DANIEL (CONT'D)

You're a wonderful boy. You'n me

gonna have fun, dammit, it don't

have to be joyless. Say, why don't

we get right down on our knees now?

JOE

Get down -- where?

O'DANIEL

Right here, why not? I prayed in

saloons, I prayed in the street, I

prayed an the toilet. He don't care

where, what He wants is that

prayer.

JOB

Shee-it...

O'DANIEL

That's the ticket, just open your

heart and let it flow. It ain't the

words, it's the love beyond 'em!

O'DANIEL'S VOICE

Don't fight it, boy!

O'DANIEL

Pray and you shall be heard!

O'DANIEL

Don't be frightened, son!

O'DANIEL

Don't run from Jesus!

JOE

Say, you know that runty little

bastard I was with?

BARTENDER

I don't know nothing.

JOE

Shee-it.

JOE

Well, now, ma'am, next time you got

that feeling coming on, you dial

JOE

RATSO

How do you like that O'Daniel,

get in touch with you when I heard,

but I been laid up with this

cold...

JOE

You want some free medical advice,

shut your goddam mouth about that

night.

RATSO

Okay, right, right, okay. Another

subject. Where you living? Still at

JOE

Shee-it. I got better things to do

RATSO'S VOICE

Hey, wait up, for crissake!

Listen, keep away from me, hear?

You come near me again, I snatch

RATSO

inviting you, goddamit.

JOE

RATSO'S VOICE

The X on the window means the

landlord can't collect rent --

account of it's condemned.

RATSO'S VOICE

The electric's off. Another

convenience.

I don't mess with Con Edison, hey?

What the hell, I got candles,

right?

RATSO

I got no heat, but by that time,

you know, cold weather, hey, I'll

be in Florida. Stretch out. Make

yourself comfortable. You hungry?

I'll put up some water for coffee.

JOE

Comfortable, kee-rist, I slept on

subways softer than this.

ANASTASIA

Love me, Joe?

JOE

Smart thing for me to do is haul

stay.

JOE

Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you

first gimme a cigarette.

JOE (CONT'D)

You want me to stay here tonight,

is that the idea?

RATSO

I ain't forcing you, like, I mean,

who's forcing you?

JOE

Oh. Guess I got the wrong

impression.

RATSO

I want you to stay, okay? I goddam

invited you, didn't I?

JOE

Well, I hope you know what you're

in for. I'm a very dangerous

person. Someone does me bad like

you. If I caught up with you that

night, there'd be one dead Ratso

long about now. Hear?

RATSO

I'm impressed. You're a killer.

JOE

So if you want me to hang around

for a few days, I thought you

JOE (CONT'D)

Property of the YMCA. You make me

wanna puke sometimes, Ratso.

RATSO

Joe -- do me one favor -- this is

my place, am I wrong? You know, in

my own place my name ain't Ratso. I

mean it so happens my name is

Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.

JOE

Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.

RATSO

Rico then, at least call me Rico in

my own goddam place.

JOE

Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?

(then)

And keep your meat hooks off my

radio.

GREENGROCER

You! Out! Out! I told you, I calla

cops!

JOE

Hey, looka here, that ain't nice,

picking on a cripple...

RATSO

The two basic items necessary to

sustain life are sunshine and

coconut milk. That's a known fact.

If I can find the goddam hole the

milk squirts out.

JOE

This is an okay setup you got here,

but I'd say you ain't just exactly,

uh, flush, is that right or not?

RATSO

I been sick. Hold this, will ya?

RATSO (CONT'D)

In Florida, they come smooth, ready

to eat.

Down there, your only problem is,

diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to

wipe warm milk off your chin.

Tough, hey?

JOE

I think finding you's the smartest

thing I ever did, for both of us.

You just the crooked kinda sneaky

little sidewinder I need to get me

hustling in this town. Hey!

RATSO

Miami Beach is the only place for a

real hustler. Florida has more rich

chicks per square yard than any

resort spot in the world. They lie

out in their pagodas and pergolas

waiting to grab the first jockstrap

that passes.

JOE

What's all this sweet talk about

Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a

stable down there now?

RATSO

Cowboy killers! Break my finger,

Christ! I got news for you, baby,

no chick with any class buys that

big dumb cowboy crap...

RATSO (CONT'D)

... the cowboy bit's out, except

among fags of a certain type, which

take a certain, type hustler to

exploit. Like I could handle it --

being a stealing operation

basically -- but take your average

fag, very few of them want a

cripple.

JOE

Well, I am dumb, that's for sure. I

don't talk right. I can't think too

good. Just only one thing I ever

been good for's loving. Women go

crazy for me. Fact. Crazy Annie.

Had to send her away. So I don't

cash in on that, what am I? I'm

shee-it. May's well flush me down

that hole with the dishwater.

JOE (CONT'D)

That's why you gonna stop crapping

about Florida and get your skinny

butt moving to earn twenty bucks

worth of management you owe me...

JOE'S VOICE

Make that twenty-three bucks.

RATSO

Look at yourself, Joe, no offense,

but frankly, you're beginning to

smell. For a stud in this town

that's a handicap.

JOE

You talk like a man with a tin

twat.

RATSO

You ain't got a chance in hell. You

need threads and glitter, baby. A

front, hey?

JOE

Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage

all that crap, or else he gonna get

a coconut up his flue.

RATSO

A woman in your condition shouldn't

do that. Let me help...

JOE'S VOICE

It ain't right, stealing from a

pregnant lady.

RATSO

What did it cost her? The

laundromat syndicate lost a couple

coins. I'm crying.

RATSO (CONT'D)

Where's mine? The black homburg? I

brought it in the same time.

JOE

Hey, you're good! I bet you could

pick up a living at this if you

tried.

RATSO

And end up a hunchback like my old

man? You think I'm crippled? You

shoulda caught him the end of a

day.

RATSO'S VOICE

You think it's funny?

RATSO

Stupid bastard coughed his lungs

out breathing that resin all day.

They buried him with gloves on.

Even the fag undertaker couldn't

get his nails clean.

JOE

Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever

for a skimpy little gimp.

RATSO

You like it? Take a look.

JOE

Don't rush me. How I do it, see, I

get myself primed, like I was

turning on the charm for some

pretty little blonde lady, then

kinda mosey away slow and easy and

- swing around! -- and there you

are, you handsome devil.

RATSO

Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're

okay, you're okay.

JOE

What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a

cowboy outta you, kid. How about

that? Build you up a little, teach

you couple little tricks'n turn

y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.

JOE (CONT'D)

Okay, you got yourself one

handsome, sweet-smelling cowboy,

strut your stuff...

RATSO

How do you like that? Cheap

bastard...

(reads, then)

I think we struck gold. This is one

high-class chick. The Barbizon for

Women!

RATSO

Mr. McNeill, I'm calling for Miss

Beecham at the Barbizon Hotel for

Women. She won't need you

tonight...

RATSO'S VOICE

Would you believe a whole goddam

hotel with nothing but lonely

chicks?

RATSO

Score once in that setup, the way

chicks talk, Christ...

RATSO (CONT'D)

Get the money! Remember Cass

Trehune? Cash! These rich bitches

write a check at night, call the

bank and stop payment in the

morning. Get the cash!

BELLHOP

Hey! No men upstairs!

MISS BEECHAM

I'm afraid there's been a terrible

mistake...

JOE

I want my money, goddamit, you owe

me my money whether you get laid or

not, lady, shee-it!

JOE

Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out,

then light a fag, a goddam fag. You

make me puke. Where'd you steal it?

In the movies?

RATSO

The coat? A guy I did a favor once

gave it to me. Christ.

JOE

Who'd you ever do a favor for? You

just let some poor bastard freeze

to death, wouldn't you?

RATSO

Where'd that come from?

JOE

Forty-second Street. Where'n hell

you think it come from?

RATSO

You wanna know the truth? You dumb

bastard, I got it for you. Look at

it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too

big for me.

JOE

Wear it yourself. I wouldn't put it

on my back.

RATSO

Goddamned if I'll wear it!

JOE

Go get your medicine. Before you

die on my goddam, hands...

JOE'S VOICE

Shee-it. I hate boneyards.

RATSO'S VOICE

So split. He ain't your goddam,

father.

JOE

Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty

little bastard, Ratso.

RATSO

The name's Rico, at my own father's

grave, a man deserves some respect.

JOE

Respect shee-it! You even steal

flowers for his grave.

RATSO

Can he smell the difference, eh?

JOE

Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't

'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.

RATSO

He can't read. Even dumber than

you. Couldn't write his own name. X

-- that's what it ought to say

there on that goddam headstone. One

big lousy X like our flat.

Condemned. By order of City Hall.

JOE

My Grammaw Sally Buck, she died

without letting me know.

RATSO

Just keep your hat on and cry a

little. They tip you when it's

over.

JOE

Just ain't right, cheating someone

dead and can't cheat back.

RATSO

You and my old man. Same kinda

mind. Putting me down till the day

he died...

(mimics)

... why can't you be like your

brothers? Sons a father could be

proud of. Yeah, sure. My brothers.

Too goddam busy making something of

themselves to show up when the old

man's dying!

RATSO (CONT'D)

What was that all about?

JOE

You wanna read something, read

this. I been invited somewhere.

JOE (CONT'D)

They picked me. The only one in the

whole goddam place. You see how

they looked me over, up and down

before they give me that?

RATSO

So?

JOE

Well, this thought just struck me.

It wasn't too long ago I was

washing dishes way the hell

somewhere in Texas.

RATSO

Yeah, well, so?

JOE

Now I'm here. I'm in New York City.

Getting picked for things. Don't

you see what I'm driving at?

RATSO

What you're driving at, you want me

to get lost so you can go to your

fancy-ass party.

JOE

Did I say that? Did I?

(studies card)

It don't say nothing about you...

RATSO

Don't say nothing about you either.

JOE

But they picked me, right? So what

I'll do, I'll just say, now look,

you want me? Well, I don't go

nowhere without my buddy here.

RATSO

(shrugs)

Well, what the hell, I got nothing

better to do.

JOE

Better dry your hair some. You

sweating all over the goddam place.

JOE (CONT'D)

You got a comb?

RATSO

Don't need a comb.

JOE

Few dozen cooties won't kill me,

don't guess.

RATSO

Okay? I look okay?

JOE

Better get a hold of someone and

tell them I'm here.

JOE (CONT'D)

Well, I made it. This here is Ratso

Rizzo and I...

RATSO

Rico. Rico Rizzo.

HANSEL

Do you need anything? I mean

there's beer and so forth. Whatever

your thing is...

RATSO

If you want the word on that

brother and sister act, I'll give

you the word. That Hansel's a fag

and Gretel's got the hots for

herself. So who cares, right? Load

up on the salami...

JOE

Shee-it, this is one helluva party!

SHIRLEY

I can tell, can't you?

JOE

Yeah, oh yeah.

SHIRLEY

What'll we do? Leave now or what?

Your place or mine? Oh God, the

second I looked at you I knew. Did

you?

RATSO'S VOICE

She's hooked...

RATSO

... I'd say she was good for ten

bucks, but I'll ask for twenty...

SHIRLEY'S VOICE

Did you know? We were going to make

it?

RATSO

You really want to do business?

SHIRLEY

Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you

two are a couple -- ?

HANSEL'S VOICE

Why are you laughing, Joe?

HANSEL

Are you for real, Joe?

JOE

Well, I ain't a f'real cowboy, but

I'm one hell of a stud!

RATSO

A very expensive stud. And I happen

to be his manager.

SHIRLEY

It's too much -- to come face to

face with a walking talking sex

fantasy -- to buy a man's -- God!

SHIRLEY'S VOICE

I can't wait to tell my man Monday.

I should be taking notes. Look at

my arm!

RATSO'S VOICE

I gotta sit down. I feel crummy.

SHIRLEY'S VOICE

Eat it -- a man in your line of

work has to keep his strength up...

SHIRLEY

It's fantastic, now I know,

everything you do has sexual

implications.

If I you know, bought it -- could I

take pictures of you naked? That's

part of it, isn't it, kinky kinda

things?

HANSEL'S VOICE

We want you, Joe. You've been

chosen.

SHIRLEY'S VOICE

I had a thing for him. Before I

knew. Why should knowing make it

more of a thing?

SHIRLEY

Naturally I'll have to ask myself

why a cowboy? And why a cowboy

whore? But not tonight.

SHIRLEY

Incidentally, how much is this

going to cost me anyway?

JOE

Tell her, Ratso.

RATSO

Twenty bucks...

SHIRLEY

Sold. Let's go.

RATSO

... and taxi fare for me.

SHIRLEY

Get lost.

RATSO

I agree. And for that service I

charge one dollar taxi fare.

SHIRLEY

Your name's Joe. Which is fabulous.

Joe could be anyone. Kiss me, Joe,

move over, Joe, go away, Joe. It's

just perfect.

SHIRLEY (CONT'D)

He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is

he all right?

RATSO

(rises, mimics)

Is he all right!

JOE

Well, if you're awright, why you

hanging on the bannister. Can you

walk or not?

RATSO

Walk? Naturally I can walk.

SHIRLEY

He's got taxi fare.

JOE

Sure you're all right?

RATSO

(shouts)

I said yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

JOE

Whoopee ti yi yo...!

SHIRLEY'S VOICE

That happens. Don't worry about

it...

JOE

Well, that's something never

happened to me before, you can bet

your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the

matches, ma'am?

SHIRLEY

Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't

call me ma'am, things would work

out better.

JOE

First goddam, time it ever quit on

me. Fact.

JOE (CONT'D)

You think I'm lying!

SHIRLEY

(controls herself)

No. Of course not. Just something

struck me funny...

SHIRLEY'S VOICE

I just put myself in your shoes. I

had this image of a bugler without

a horn, a policeman without a

stick, etcetera, etcetera and I...

(giggles)

I think I'd better shut up, I'm

making it worse.

SHIRLEY

Maybe we should take a little nap,

see what happens?

JOE

I ain't sleepy.

SHIRLEY

I know. Scribbage!

JOE

Shee-it...

SHIRLEY

That's pretty Freudian, Joe.

JOE

What? It's a perfectly good word,

ain't it. How much time I got?

(glances up)

Goddam sand thing drive you crazy.

Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very

strong point with me. Even in

school.

SHIRLEY

If you didn't talk so much, maybe

you could think more.

JOE

Talking helps. Don't talk, you get

muddled in your head. Hey! Now you

just look at this here!

SHIRLEY

There's an E in MONEY. If that's

your word.

JOE

M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just

exactly how they spell it up there

on that big building, bet you could

see it from here. M-O-N-Y.

SHIRLEY

(stifles giggle)

Okay. Never argue with a man.

JOE

Y -- what in hell starts with Y?

SHIRLEY

It can end in Y day, pay, lay --

hey, pay lay!

JOE

Cut it out. That's cheating,

teasing me so I can't think.

Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna

beat you!

SHIRLEY

You gonna beat me, Joe?

JOE

Beat your butt, you don't lemme

think!

SHIRLEY

Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that --

gay fey -- is that your problem?

JOE

I show you what problem --

JOE'S VOICE

Whoopee ti yi yo...

SHIRLEY

Well, I really can't talk now, if

you know what I mean, but believe

me when I say, Myra, it's an

experience every emancipated woman

owes herself. I'm not. I'm not

exaggerating. Well, what's Phil's

poker night?

(yells off)

Joe -- are you available next

Thursday, eight-thirty?

JOE

Well, lemme think now, Thursday,

eight-thirty, yeah, I guess I could

be available. Hell, yeah.

SHIRLEY

Why don't you just come here? I'll

be working every night this week.

I'll leave a key with the super...

JOE'S VOICE

Well, ma'am -- Shirley -- I sure

hate to trouble you, but...

JOE

See what you think of that crap.

I'll pour your soup. Got some of

that junk you like to swill, too.

Mentholatum. Aspirin. All that shee

it...

JOE (CONT'D)

They wrong?

RATSO

No. But while you was buying the

underwear, I could have lifted the

socks.

JOE

You couldn't lift fly specks from a

sugar bowl. Can you hold this?

RATSO

But thanks.

(hesitates, then)

Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this

or anything. You promise?

JOE

Yeah.

RATSO

Well, I don't think I can walk.

(embarrassed)

I mean, I been falling down a lot

and, uh...

JOE

And what?

RATSO

I'm scared.

JOE

What of?

RATSO

What'll happen. I mean what they do

to, you know, do with you -- if you

can't -- ah, Christ!

JOE

Who?

RATSO

I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how

should I know?

JOE

Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see

the doctor. I got nine bucks and

twenty more Thursday and I gonna be

riding high before you know it. So

you gonna get you the best goddam

doctor in this town and get

yourself straightened out, that's

what.

RATSO

No doctors. No, sir. Not me.

Doctors are like goddam auto

mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug

another. Operate for piles and

while they're there, they unscrew

your liver. My old man, for God's

sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when

he went to the doctor.

JOE

Well, just exactly what the hell

you think you're gonna do? Die on

me?

RATSO

I'm going to Florida, that's my

only chance.

JOE

You know what's wrong with you? You

got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug.

How you gonna get to Florida?

RATSO

I'll find the money. If you just

get me on the bus, that's all I

ask.

JOE

Just when everything's going my

way, you gotta pull a stunt like

this.

RATSO

I don't even want you to go.

Whaddya think of that? I got other

plans for my life than dragging

around some dumb cowboy that thinks

he's God's gift to women. One

twenty-buck trick and he's already

the biggest stud in New York City.

It's laughable.

JOE

When I put you on that bus down to

Florida tonight, that'll be the

happiest day of my life!

JOE

Hey, Shirley... Miss who? Oh, yeah,

well, when will Missus Gardner be

home? ... I'm a friend of hers, a

goddam good friend... Shee-it, I

can't wait till then...

TOWNY'S VOICE

Bravo...

TOWNY

How are you?

(more quietly)

Townsend P. Locke, from Chicago.

Call me Towny. I'm here to attend a

paper manufacturers' convention

and, frankly, to have a little fun,

dammit...

TOWNY

This is my first night in town and

I'll consider it a ghastly omen

clouding my entire ten days, if you

don't consent to have dinner with

me. Anywhere you like...

TOWNY (CONT'D)

... never mind how you're dressed.

They know me. I'll say you're with

the rodeo. There's always a rodeo

in New York, dammit. Besides, you

look very elegant...

TOWNY

But, dammit all, I just remembered,

we'll have to eat in my room

because I have this phone call

coming at nine-thirty...

TOWNY

What I like about you, you're such

a wonderful conversationalist. So

won't that be nice to have dinner

sent up?

TOWNY

Fifty years ago this was the only

hotel in Manhattan. My mother

always calls me at her bedtime, so

I've got to be there.

TOWNY

A drink? I've got some nice gin. If

you'd prefer something else,

they'll send it up...

JOE

Gin's okay.

TOWNY

It's so exciting. New York. The mad

forward thrust of everything. My

sense of time here is completely

altered.

TOWNY

Sometimes it seems to me time

stopped twenty years ago. There was

this war, there was this handsome

young man with quite black hair and

he was supposed to die. But he

didn't. Isn't that amusing?

JOE

What?

TOWNY

Enough about me. I'm through

talking for the evening. Now I want

to hear about conditions in the

West. The romance of the West holds

a tremendous power over me. Mother

was actually a pioneer woman, can

you believe it? When she calls,

I'll introduce you and she'll be so

thrilled.

TOWNY'S VOICE

Mama, a coincidence. Guess who was

being discussed. Discussed. Not

disgusted. Discussed! Do you have

that thing turned up? Why aren't

you wearing it! This is impossible!

JOE'S VOICE

Listen, Towny, did I mention I got

a sick kid?

JOE

Well, he is, he's sicker'n shee-it.

And I've gotta get him South quick

as I can...

TOWNY

I was so childish with her.

JOE

What d'you want?

TOWNY

What?

JOE

What you got me up here for?

TOWNY

Oh, difficult, it's so difficult.

You're a nice person, Joe -- I

should never have asked you up -- a

lovely person. Oh, how I loathe

life. I loathe it. Please go.

Please.

JOE

You want me to leave?

TOWNY

No, yes. No, I mean yes please go.

Help me to be good. Come back

tomorrow. Promise.

JOE

I'm going to Florida.

TOWNY

This is terrible. I meet someone

who -- then -- wait, I want to give

you a present. For your trip.

You'll let me please...

TOWNY

Please take it. You don't have to

be Catholic. Saint Christopher is

the patron saint of all travelers.

I want you to have it. For helping

me be good.

JOE

Listen, I gotta have money.

TOWNY

Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have

thought. You shouldn't have to ask.

That was thoughtless of me. Yes.

Wait here...

TOWNY (CONT'D)

Here. Don't even thank me.

JOE

(takes the bill)

I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta

have fifty-seven dollars.

TOWNY

I simply don't have it, Joe.

JOE

Get outta my way.

TOWNY

You're wasting your time. There's

nothing in there.

JOE

Let go. Let go of the table.

TOWNY

I deserved that, I know I did.

TOWNY (CONT'D)

I brought this on myself. I'm

bleeding, my nose is bleeding,

isn't it?

JOE

You wanna gimme fifty-seven dollars

or you wanna busted skull?

JOE (CONT'D)

Please let go of that table.

TOWNY

Thank you, Joe.

RATSO

Thirty-one hours.

RATSO (CONT'D)

The trip is. Nine-thirty in the

morning we get there. Not this

morning but the next one at nine

thirty.

JOE

These guys're good drivers.

RATSO

They gotta be.

JOE

Yeah.

RATSO

You get your first palm tree in

South Carolina.

JOE

How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like

you know that?

RATSO

I read it.

JOE

Shee-it. You believe all you read?

JOE

If you have to shiver, why don't

you pull the blanket up more?

RATSO

I been thinking. I hope we're not

gonna have a lotta trouble about my

name down there. Because like

what's the whole point of this trip

anyway?

JOE

Keep the goddam blanket on.

RATSO

I mean New York's one thing, but

can you see this guy, imagine it,

running around the goddam beach all

suntan and he's going in swimming,

like, and then somebody yells 'Hey,

Ratso' -- how does that sound to

you?

JOE

Sounds like they knew you.

RATSO

Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm

not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the

time, okay, do you blame me? That's

agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all

these new people my name's Rico?

JOE

Hey -- whatsa matter?

RATSO

(barely audible)

I'm wet.

JOE

You're what?

RATSO

I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.

JOE

Hell, don't cry about it!

RATSO

Here I am going to Florida and my

leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest

hurts, my face hurts, and like that

ain't enough, I gotta pee all over

myself.

RATSO (CONT'D)

I'm falling apart, that's funny?

JOE

(nods, laughing)

You just -- just -- what happened,

you just had a little rest stop

wasn't on the schedule.

JOE (CONT'D)

Hey, what size pants you wear?

JOE

Couple crullers'n coffee to go.

WAITRESS

Where you from?

JOE

New York.

RATSO

Hey, what the hell you doing?

JOE

I'm zipping your fly, what the hell

you think I'm doing?

RATSO

Thanks, Joe.

JOE

Shee-it, you know, I got this thing

all figured out, Ratso. I mean

Rico. When we get to Miami, what

I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta

do that, 'cause see, I ain't no

kind of a hustler. I ain't even any

goddam good as a bum. I'm a

nothing, that's what I am. So

reckon I'd better go to work and

get me a goddam job. Okay?

JOE (CONT'D)

Yeah, guess that's what I'm gonna

do.

DRIVER

Yes, sir?

JOE,

My friend's dead in the back seat.

DRIVER

Your friend's what in the back

seat?

JOE

Dead. Dead as a doornail.

DRIVER

Is this some kind of...

DRIVER (CONT'D)

Okay, folks, everything's fine.

Nothing to worry about.

DRIVER (CONT'D)

Is he kin to you?

DRIVER (CONT'D)

Don't you want to close his eyes?

JOE

Close them?

DRIVER

Just reach over and close them.

That's all.

DRIVER (CONT'D)

I guess we'll just drive on, right?

Nothing else to do.

JOE

No, sir. Not till Miami. I'll see

to burying then.

DRIVER

Just a little sickness, folks,

nothing serious. We'll be in

Miami...

(looks at watch)

... in forty minutes.

THE END
