BLACK RAIN

BLACK RAIN

by

Craig Bolotin

&

Warren Lewis

November 1987

"Seven or eleven"... "Play two"...

NICK

One, and one on top.

DEALER

House sees.

PLAYER ONE

(hesitates)

I'm out.

DEBUTANTE

(her eyes still on

Nick)

I see the deuce, and one to chase

them home.

NICK

Call.

DEBUTANTE

(showing her hand)

Ladies, aces wired.  Sorry sport.

NICK

Very nice, Barbie.

(pointing toward her

boyfriend)

Now, I'd take Ken over there and go

home.

DEBUTANTE

Why's that?

NICK

It's time.  That's all.

BOYFRIEND

The lady wants to play.  Someone

should teach you to be a better

loser, loser.

NICK

Listen, Ken --

BOYFRIEND

My name is not Ken --

NICK

-- I'm offering you the benefit of

my experience.

DEBUTANTE

Looks like you have a lot of

experience in places like this.  It

was nice of them to relax the dress

code for you.

CHARLIE

Typical New York woman, big

attitude, small apartment, no tits.

CHARLIE

I think she got to you, pappy.

NICK

(checking his watch)

You want a popsicle, go to Good

Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'

CHARLIE

(glancing at the

door)

Still, you gotta wonder how she'd

look in handcuffs.

NICK

(calmly)

Alley oop.

ZACHARA

Settle down.  Hey, quiet... Please.

NICK

SHUT THE HELL UP, GODDAMNIT!

NICK

My name is Conklin.  Let's do this

fast so I can go home.

NICK

(softer)

It's all yours.

ZACHARA

(reads)

Under section 216 of the New York

State Penal code, I serve notice

that this premise and it's

occupants...

CHARLIE

Whoa -- where do you think you're

going, hotdog.

NICK

(sighs)

Fabulous...

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

(over the dryer)

... It's not like you were slow or

anything... I think you did just

fine.  I think you did great.

NICK

Thanks.

CHARLIE

Hey, hey, where you goin'?

NICK

Home.

CHARLIE

Wait up.  You know the guy who did

the Weismuller through the window --

NICK

-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.

CHARLIE

You know him?

NICK

He works for Frank Abolofia.

Atlantic City.  Casinos.

CHARLIE

So why dive through the glass for a

nickel and dime bust?

NICK

What's this?

CHARLIE

Let go...

CHARLIE

Back-up.

NICK

Get rid of it.

CHARLIE

Why?

NICK

It's not regulation.  And the only

way you're gonna stop anybody with

it is to show it to him, and while

he's laughing, you can shove it down

his throat.

CHARLIE

(looking at Nick's

bike)

I'll get rid of it when you get rid

of the egg-beater.

CHARLIE

Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag

Cavello.

NICK

Charlie...

NICK

... You still got shaving cream on

your ear.

NICK

Short shift?

CONNIE

Yeah... I came to save you.  If

you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.

CUT TO:

CONNIE

It's getting too cold even for me,

Nick.

NICK

Connie...

CONNIE

All right, how's the new partner?

NICK

High spirits, desire, commitment.

CONNIE

You'll take care of that.

NICK

Give me a break, would you?

CONNIE

If you give me one.

NICK

Are you expecting anyone?

CONNIE

I wasn't expecting you.

CONNIE

(poking her head in

the room)

Imagine a small, greasy Boy Scout.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

... I found the goombah... Cavello.

He's --

NICK

-- I should tear your head off.

CHARLIE

Whoa, I knew you were going to say

that.  I absolutely anticipated

that, Nick.  But I said to myself,

Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on

this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll

be pissed for a moment, but then

it'll dawn on him --

NICK

-- Hey, I got a better chance of

being hit by a bus then moving up.

CHARLIE

... Look... they told me at the

Greek's you were here.  I'm sorry, I

never imagined...

CHARLIE

(buddy buddy)

I like her.  She's nice.

(lowering his voice)

For her age.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

What are they doing now?

NICK

Eating Scungilli, just like the last

time you asked.

CHARLIE

Who do you think the Jap is?

NICK

Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru.

How would I know?

CHARLIE

I don't blame you for being sore.

It'll pass when we bag him.

CHARLIE

Whatdaya think?  'Bostonians'.

Eighty-five bucks.

(lowering his voice)

Girls go for shoes.  Second place

they look.

(off Nick's

reaction)

Hey, I read it in a magazine.

NICK

(dead serious)

Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise

me?

CHARLIE

What?

NICK

Frank Abolofia.

CHARLIE

The Wolf?

NICK

(in a whisper)

Some party.

CHARLIE

Maybe we should do something?

NICK

Charlie, take your gum, stick it

under your ass and keep it warm.

NUMBER ONE

(in Japanese)

Give it to me.

BUSINESSMAN

(in Japanese)

Go to hell.

CHARLIE

(in a whisper)

What are you doing?

NICK

Saving your life.

ABOLOFIA

You people are wild... Wild.

NICK

(shouting)

Police officers.  Everybody stay

put.

(to Charlie)

Get back up.

CHARLIE

(nervously showing

shield)

Police.

CHARLIE

Call 911.  Tell them an officer

needs assistance.  Say ten thirteen.

CHARLIE

Do it, you dumb bastard!

CHARLIE

NICK...!  Shit... SHIT!!

CUT TO:

NICK

On the ground, man.  NOW!!

FADE TO BLACK.

NICK (O.S.)

Yeah... sure, sure I'll be down.

CUT TO:

OLIVER

How big a package we talking about?

NICK

(holding up his

hands)

This by this...

OLIVER

Dope?

NICK

Not in that company.

OLIVER

The old man was a Japanese paper

manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental

car were full of it.

CHARLIE

Full of what?

OLIVER

(annoyed)

Art and stationary paper.  Cavello

had five hundred thousand in his

attache case.

OLIVER

One guy do all the damage?

NICK

Yeah.

OLIVER

Thought you knew your way around

dark alleys, detective.

TECHIE

... The old man's suit was Japanese.

The hitter's was Saville row.  No

I.D.  We're doing a peel now.

TECHIE

There's something you got to see.

TECHIE

What's wrong with this picture?

CHARLIE

(nervously)

I got a tattoo.  Birdie on the ball.

We all got them when we finished

basic at Camp Lejune.

NICK

Charlie.

TECHIE

I thought you guys were trained

observers?

TECHIE

Eight fingers.

(ironically)

Hey, it was a trick question.

CUT TO:

ABOLOFIA

He was with a friend, sure.  I shake

hands with the guy and a minute

later he's bleeding all over my

socks.

ATTORNEY

Will that do officers?  My client

has had a terrible shock.

NICK

Yeah, he's not used to seeing other

people do the killing.

ATTORNEY

I won't tolerate harassment!

OLIVER

What about the package?

ATTORNEY

We know nothing about it.

ABOLOFIA

Hard to believe a trained police

officer could let this kind of thing

happen right in front of his face.

NICK

I did make a mistake.  I let the

wrong guy get hit.

ABOLOFIA

Cheer up, Nick.  I'm sure it's

easier to pick a dead man's pocket.

ATTORNEY

That's it, we're through!

CUT TO:

OLIVER

Doesn't speak a word of English.

And he won't speak Japanese either.

No papers.  The Japanese embassy is

very interested.

NICK

Why?

OLIVER

He's wanted in Japan.  They want him

first.  Then we can have him.

NICK

What?

CUT TO:

OLIVER

Japanese embassy talks to state

department.  State talks to police

plaza.  They to me and me to you.

Shit rolls down hill.

OLIVER

You and Charlie are taking the Jap

home, tonight.

NICK

What...?  What if I say no?

OLIVER

Check your gun before you leave.

They're not allowed in Japan.  It's

a nice, safe country.

NICK

Why me?

OLIVER

They said send a detective if I

could spare one.

(then)

I can always spare you.

NICK

(soft)

You got something to say to me,

Captain?

OLIVER

Yeah.  Have a wonderful flight.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

... Nick, you're the one that's

always saying you never go anywhere.

NICK

I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie.

Maybe Vegas.

CHARLIE

What are you missing?  Riding your

motorcycle to the nurse's house.

That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.

NICK

Beats forty hours on a plane.

CHARLIE

They say we got to turn around and

come right back.  That's what they

say.  I got a plan.

CHARLIE

I call, right?  I say I got the

dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits

from some raw clam and we stretch it

into three days.  You and I become a

driving force on the local Geisha

scene.

NICK

Not a prayer.

CHARLIE

(grinning)

Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop

from New York.  You're gonna be the

biggest thing to hit town since

Godzilla.

CHARLIE

Says here, it's very impolite to

touch someone while you're talking

to them...

(nudges Kobo)

Guess that means you can't talk and

screw at the same time, huh, hotdog?

What's the matter, no -- speaky-the-

language?  Understand this:  You

will never ever fuck with my partner

again.

NICK

Shut-up, Charlie.

NICK

What'd you say?

CHARLIE

Where is the subway station, please.

NICK

Get a new book.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

Nick... You up?

NICK

No.

CHARLIE

Nick, have I been a good partner?

NICK

Number five with a bullet.

CHARLIE

I just want you to know... I mean

anybody who says you ever took has

got to deal with me.

NICK

Go to sleep, Charlie.

CHARLIE

You didn't take, did you...?  You

hear things.

NICK

I worked the three nine in Queens,

Charlie.

CHARLIE

(surprised)

I didn't know.

NICK

The lieutenant was on the pad along

with the rest of the squad.  I was

new, didn't know shit.  When the

feathers flew, I got called in front

of the special prosecutor.  It's on

the top of my personnel file.  They

think I'm dirty or I cut a deal.

Doesn't leave you with a lot of

friends either way.

NICK

I might as well have done something.

I've been paying for it every

goddamn day since I got

transferred...

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

Whoa.  Nick, we're in paradise.

NAGASHIMA

Officers Conklin and -- and...

(he can't say

Charlie's name)

... gentlemen, welcome.  I am

assistant inspector Nagashima.

NICK

You going to take this crap off our

hands?

NAGASHIMA

(confused)

Crap...?  Oh, the prisoner.  Yes.

CHARLIE

(extends his hand)

Charlie.  Kon-ich-iwa.

NAGASHIMA

If you will please give this to the

customs inspector he will expidate

-- expedite you.  We have a car and

a driver outside.

NICK

Right.

CHARLIE

(bows)

Arigato.

NICK

Givin' you a book is like givin' a

baby a gun.

CHARLIE

Hey, when in Rome --

NICK

In Rome, I'll bow.

CUT TO:

NICK

Inspector Nagashima told me to give

you this.

INSPECTOR

(broken English)

You must get in line behind the

rest.

NICK

We're cops.  Pol-ice-men.

NICK

Fellas, get serious.

MAN (O.S.)

Nick!

KOBO

(perfect English)

Thanks for the ride, detective.

CUT TO:

NICK

Cops!  He's our prisoner!

NICK

What's going on?  We're the good

guys!

CUT TO:

NICK

Get me something like an Identi-Kit

and I'll give you a description.

CHARLIE

There must be some witnesses from

the airport?

NICK

What is it, tea time?

OHASHI

(quiet rage)

You lost a man we wanted for some

time.  It was very incompetent on

your part, officer.

NICK

Incompetent is letting people waltz

through a secure area wearing your

uniforms, carrying official

documents.

NICK

I want a gun.

OHASHI

It is not allowed.

NICK

We're police officers.

OHASHI

You're foreigners.

NICK

Work with me.  I want your best

detective.

NICK

Hey, inspector, I don't intend to

take the rap for this.

OHASHI

(not looking up)

Do you know what this is?

OHASHI

It's a laundry list.  Go home,

detective.

NICK

Let's go.

CHARLIE

Nick, we can't just --

NICK

I said let's go, Charlie.

OHASHI

What are you doing?!

NICK

Your best detective, Ohashi.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto.

Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our

side.

NICK

Let's grab some food.

CHARLIE

First decent idea you've had.

CHARLIE

Food... Food, here we go.  Tokyo

offers a wide variety of food.  It's

best to sample the local

specialties, including sashaimi,

soba, and world renown Kobe beef...

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

This should be it...

NICK

You said that in the last two

places.

CHARLIE

Kore?  Doku?  Kore doku?

NICK

Okay, you were right.

CHARLIE

This the right place?

NICK

I hope not.

CHARLIE

Konichiwa.  Ichiro Matsumoto?

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

(looking around)

Getting very weird.

NICK

I'd feel better if we had some heat.

CHARLIE

Maybe we should bail?

NICK

(looking at the maze

of streets)

Think we could find our way back?

CUT TO:

MAN'S VOICE (FROM THE DARKNESS)

Big shots from New York.  I like

your style!

ICH

(bowing)

Detective Ichiro Matsumoto.  I'm the

man you're looking for.

ICH

The man you are looking for, Kobo,

was a member of the Samaguchi-gummi.

A Yakuza.

NICK

Where do we start looking for this

guy?

ICH

Where would you look for the mafia?

CHARLIE

The back room at Lombardi's after

the Columbus Day Parade.  Under the

bed.  In the mayor's office.

Everywhere.

NICK

Where're you going, Ichiro?

ICH

(stops, faces them)

The mayor's office, under the bed,

the back room at Lombardi's.

(tucking in his

shirt tail)

And call me Ich.

CUT TO:

ICH

(singing)

"Goodness, gracious, great balls of

fire."

(raising glass for

toast)

To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.

NICK

(checking his watch)

Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo

And The Don't's.  Let's book,

Charlie.  If he starts on Motown,

we'll be here all night.

ICH

No, this is the place for the young

Yakuza.

NICK

That's what you said in the last

three piss pots.

ICH

I love you people.  The music, the

clothes, the movies... Japanese

respect only what is Japanese.

NICK

It's incredible.  Hit him or

something.

CHARLIE

I don't think he'd feel it.

ICH

(beginning to slur

his words)

Americans change everything.  When I

was young the city was wood and

paper... I was ten when the bombers

came.  I lived underground for three

days.  When I came up, the city was

gone... A ball of fire.

ICH

It began to rain, Nick.  You know

what color the rain was?

ICH

Black... It was black from the ash.

Very impressive.  You Americans, you

could make black rain.

CHARLIE

(leaning close)

Say Ich, between friends, where can

I grab some squish around here?

ICH

Squid?

CHARLIE

Pussy, ass, soft personnel.

ICH

Ah, Joyce...

(in Japanese)

How are you tonight?

JOYCE

(in Japanese)

Hello, Ich.  Johnny Walker?

NICK

Don't give him any more.

JOYCE

He gets as much as he wants.

CHARLIE

Hello hello, Charlie Skloaris.  New

York City.

CHARLIE

My partner and I are cops.

(lowering his voice)

We're on a very big assignment here.

(nothing from Joyce)

When do you get off?

JOYCE

Right when you're being tucked into

bed.

ICH

You should be nicer to my American

friends, Joyce.

JOYCE

They wouldn't appreciate it, Ich.

Trust me.

ICH

Joyce can be nice.

CHARLIE

(brightening)

What'd she say?

ICH

(big smile)

That I should let you pay for the

drinks.

(raising his glass)

Kampai.

CUT TO:

ICH

... We got to keep looking.  Track

him down!  Great balls of fire!

NICK

(frustrated, to a

cabbie)

What's the problem here?

WOMAN (O.S.)

You don't speak the language.  I'll

drop him off.

ICH

Ah, Joyce...

ICH

(out the window)

See you tomorrow!

NICK

Not a prayer.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

... He's a sorry old guy, but I like

him.

NICK

He couldn't find his ass with both

hands.

CHARLIE

Now that's the kind of motorcycle I

want to see you on.

NICK

(muttering)

Sure, a rice burning crotch

rocket...

CHARLIE

Nick, how we gonna bag this guy

without any help?  Maybe I should

work on that girl Joyce, she speaks

the language.

DISSOLVE TO:

ICH (O.S.)

Nick!

NICK

Give us a break...

ICH (O.S.)

It's Ichiro.  Ich.

NICK

Leave the rice cake outside and go

home!

ICH

There's been a murder.  Yakuza.  You

should come.

CUT TO:

NICK

Could you fill me in?

OHASHI

Why don't you ask your chief

detective?

NICK

Because I want you to tell me.

OHASHI

The young are eating the old,

something that usually doesn't

happen here.

NICK

Can we skip the poetry, inspector?

OHASHI

There's a war, detective, between

two rival groups.  The man who

escaped, Kobo, leads the younger

group.  They did this.

ICH

Kobo's a wild boy.  He was a

lieutenant in the Sammaguchi-gummi.

OHASHI

(in Japanese)

Excellent, Officer Matsumoto.  How

is your investigation going?

ICH

(in Japanese)

Well, sir.  Thank you for giving me

the opportunity to work with these

distinguished gentlemen.

POLICE LIEUTENANT

Looking for clues in the bottom of a

sake bottle, Matsumoto?

OHASHI

He's an officer of great

distinction.

CHARLIE

Hey, Ich has been helpful.

OHASHI

(ignoring him, to

Nick)

Have you changed your mind and

decided to go home, detective?

NICK

Not until one of us bags Kobo.

(looking at the

corpse)

And it doesn't look like you're

doing so hot.

CUT TO:

NICK

You know, Inspector, you take shit

once, you take shit forever.

ICH

(beat)

I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.

NICK

Why the hell not?

ICH

I don't, that's all.

CHARLIE

You cool, Ich?

ICH

Cool?

CHARLIE

You all right?  You okay?

CHARLIE

What does Ichiro mean, anyway?

ICH

(smiling)

What does Charlie mean?

CHARLIE

Hey, all right.

NICK

Charlie!

spin around.  A half dozen tunnels spin out in all

directions.

near the turnstile.

NICK

(calling after him)

It's a set-up...!  Charlie!

NICK

Charlie!

NICK

NO!!

ICH

Nick!

FADE TO WHITE.

OHASHI (O.S.)

... You ignored me.  I don't care

about what you want.  Get on a

plane, detective Conklin.  Go home.

CUT TO:

OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)

It's not your job.

NICK

He was my partner.

OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)

They're blaming it on you.  Christ,

Conklin, you didn't even tell me you

lost the prisoner!

NICK

I planned on catching him, Captain.

OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)

How?  You don't know the place.  You

don't know the language.  Get on the

plane.

NICK

He killed a police officer.

OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)

Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it.

That's orders.  Period.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

Note years.  1230 hours and 72

degrees in central Osaka.  This is

specialist Doug Dale, Tapestries in

Jazz, on the Far East Network, armed

forces radio...

NICK

What happened?

ICH

They made you leave your hotel...

(looks away)

... you caused a disturbance.

ICH

It may be too soon to talk about it.

When someone we care for dies we...

(beat)

... keep something of their's.  A

tie, a pen.

NICK

Why weren't you at the platform?

ICH

I couldn't keep up.  My shame is

complete.

CUT TO:

ICH

You must leave?

NICK

Yeah...

ICH

I'll get him for you, Nick.

CLERK

Aisle or window, sir?

I want to cash it in.  Yen.

NICK

Ichiro?

CUT TO:

NICK (O.S.)

What's tricks?

JOYCE

Ich said you left.

NICK

There was a change in plans.

JOYCE

I'm sorry about your friend.

JOYCE

Dead gaiijin's are big news.

NICK

Gaiijin?

JOYCE

An outside person.  A foreigner.  A

barbarian.  You, me.

(beat)

More you.

NICK

I could use some help.  Show me

around.  I'll pay you for your time.

JOYCE

I don't give tours.

NICK

You can count on the truth from

people who don't like you.

JOYCE

You have a helluva way of asking for

help.

NICK

You have a helluva way of answering.

JOYCE

Look, you need Ich.  I've been here

five years and I still can't read

all the street signs.

NICK

Maybe I'm a quicker learner.

JOYCE

I don't think so.

ICH (O.S.)

Nicklaus-san.

ICH

I've continued working on the case!

NICK

I can see that.

ICH

(signaling to Joyce)

Joyce... A drink please.

(to Nick)

Kobo has disappeared.  My superiors

don't trust me.

ICH

Kobo's.  Taken off him when he was

arrested in New York.

ICH

I knew you'd come back.  You feel

you have a debt you can never pay.

But you will, even if it costs you

your life.  Giri.  Honor.

NICK

How'd you get this?

ICH

I stole them.

ICH

Partners, Nicklaus-san?

NICK

Partners.

CUT TO:

JOYCE

Busy man.

NICK

Know her?

ICH

(shaking his head)

We can ask someone I used to work

with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay

money to...

NICK

A snitch?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NICK

What's he saying?

ICH

(looking up)

He says they're very nice.  He wants

to know if you have anymore.

ICH

I'll ask him again.

NICK

My turn.

NICK

Who is she?

ICH

Nick, stop.

ICH

This man must be treated with

respect.

NICK

Aw, for Christ's sake.

NICK

(to Ich)

Now we're making progress.

CUT TO:

NICK

That's Kobo's girl?  He's sure?

ICH

He's sure.

ICH

Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three

days.  He might not even be in

Tokyo.

NICK

Only one way to find out... Get her

up in the morning and put her to bed

at night.

CUT TO:

NICK

Think you could keep it to a dull

roar?

ICH

It's good manners.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ICH

You said you could keep up with her!

'No problem, Nick-san.'

NICK

(cutting Ich off)

No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do

anything, and for Christ's sake,

don't apologize!

ICH

Nick...

NICK

What'd I tell you?

ICH

There she is!

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

ICH

You dislike me.

NICK

Did I say that?

ICH

You toler -- yes, tolerate me.

NICK

Are we getting married?

ICH

I'm a joke.  They sent you to me to

make a fool of you.

NICK

You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop

it, okay?

ICH

Sure.

DISSOLVE TO:

NICK

Let's book.

NICK

Let's go.

CUT TO:

ICH

You can't do this.

NICK

Call a cop.

CUT TO:

ICH

Nick...

NICK

(facing him)

If you're gonna give me a hard time,

wait outside.

NICK

Not too shabby for a perfume pusher.

ICH

Too bad it's not in yen.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

ICH

Work, lunch, groceries, laundry...

Fabulous...

NICK

(looking back out

the window)

Four goddamn days.  This is going

nowhere...

JOYCE (O.S.)

It's me.

JOYCE

What's the latest?

ICH

We'll get him, Joyce.

JOYCE

She ever pull down her shades?

NICK

(right back at her)

Sure, but then I just pull out the

photos.

ICH

(enthusiastically)

Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku,

Ganmodoki --

NICK

Ichiro --

ICH

(realizing)

Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll,

soybean curd, devils tongue --

NICK

Smells like Bayonne at low tide.

NICK

Whoa whoa...

JOYCE

Don't be an ass.

NICK

He's on duty.

JOYCE

I paid for that.

NICK

Alley oop!

CUT TO:

ICH

Yakuza.

NICK

Good.  Very good...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NICK

She disappeared... shit!

ICH

You were too far behind.

ICH

(recalling Nick's

words)

Don't say anything more.  Don't do

anything.  And, for Christ's sake,

don't apologize!

DISSOLVE TO:

ICH

Nicklaus-san!

CUT TO:

NICK

Hey, no hands, huh?

ICH

You can't come in.  They don't

want --

NICK

Gaiijin.

ICH

I'll check it out.

NICK

If I smell one drop of Scotch on

your breath, my friend --

ICH

You can trust me.

ICH

(in Japanese)

Let me up.

HOSTESS

(shoving him down)

Sit, sweetie.

(to bartender)

Another Seagrams!

ICH

(drunken, in Japanese)

I have to piss, gentlemen... I'm so

sorry but I have to --

NICK

I don't believe it...

(grabs him)

Son-of-a-bitch --

ICH

(under his breath)

I'm not drunk...

NICK

We're through.  I mean it.  This is

the end of the line, Matsumoto.

ICH

Nick --

NICK

Shut-up.

ICH

You shut-up!

(then)

Kobo is inside.  He's with Sugai,

the head of the Summaguchi-clan.

ICH

... A Godfather.  His man was killed

at the printing plant.

NICK

I want to yank Kobo.

ICH

Not without a small army, Nicklaus-

san.

NICK

Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus,

not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san.

Nick.

ICH

San is an honorable title.

CUT TO:

NICK

Shit...

ICH

(doesn't understand)

Nick?!

CUT TO:

JAPANESE MAN (FROM THE DARKNESS)

People like Charlie are a dime a

dozen.

KOBO

Keep the change.

NICK

I'm taking you back.

KOBO

Here I am.

KOBO

Charlie was a rookie...

KOBO

... But you can take care of

yourself.  You're 'the biggest thing

to hit this town since Godzilla.'

KOBO

What's the matter.  I'm right in

front of you, Nick.

(takes a step closer)

But I was right in front of you when

you let Charlie die.

KOBO

Walk away again.  Maybe you'll get

used to it.

ICH

Nick!

NICK

(to Ohashi)

A few minutes faster, we might've

nailed him.

NICK

What's this?

OHASHI

Your visa has expired.  Be on a

plane in twenty-four hours or you

will be deported.

NICK

While you were hanging out at the

visa office, we found the son-of-a-

bitch.

OHASHI

Look.

OHASHI

You ruined an on-going investigation

that could have gotten us more than

one runner.

(to Ich, in Japanese)

I want a full report in the morning,

officer.

NICK

Maybe if you'd work with us --

NICK

(shouting)

Hey...!

(Ohashi keeps

walking)

HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!

OHASHI

(his back toward

Nick)

Twenty-four hours, detective.

NICK

Ohashi!

ICH

Nick, stop!

NICK

Damnit, Ichiro, I'm tired of people

telling me what I can and can't do.

No one ever solved anything sitting

on their ass.

CUT TO:

NICK

The ice help?

NICK

Where does this Sugai live?

ICH

(cold)

A resort city, Beppu.

NICK

I want to go talk to him.

ICH

What...?  Why?

NICK

Because he knows how to get to our

man.

ICH

He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.

NICK

I'll be a nice Gaiijin.

NICK

The little bastard.  God bless him.

ICH

It's very small.

NICK

Big enough.

ICH

It's illegal, Nick.

NICK

It's a new deal.

(putting it in his

waist band)

... coming with me tomorrow?

ICH

Sugai's not going to be impressed

with your gun, Nick.

(beat)

No.  I won't put myself in danger

for you anymore.

NICK

Sure, pal.  You've got better things

to do.

CUT TO:

NICK

You know where I can get a decent

cup of coffee this time of night?

I'm buying.

JOYCE

Somebody must be suffering

somewhere, you're being so nice.

NICK

I need your help, Joyce.

JOYCE

Where's Ich?

NICK

Unavailable.

CUT TO:

JOYCE

I've heard of Sugai.  I've also

heard of the emperor.  They're both

national treasures.  One's a hood.

NICK

I need someone to translate for me.

JOYCE

My Japanese isn't that hot...

Besides, you'll never get in.

NICK

It's my last shot.  I have to be on

a plane home tomorrow night.

JOYCE

And I'm supposed to care?

NICK

You could fake it.

CUT TO:

JOYCE

You're wrong to sell Ich short.

NICK

He drinks.

JOYCE

He's got a reason.

JOYCE

His son hooked up with some bikers.

Yakuza kids.  A cop shot him running

from a robbery.

JOYCE

A father doesn't out live that kind

of thing here, much less a police

officer...

NICK

Where's the wife?

JOYCE

You met her.

JOYCE

The woman in the apartment.  She

won't speak to him.  But she won't

leave either.  Japan... Nice, huh?

JOYCE

Not wound too tight...

CUT TO:

JOYCE

I'd invite you up but I know you'd

hate the incense.

(as if to explain)

I chant.

NICK

What do you chant?

JOYCE

'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think

it's dumb of course.

NICK

Not if it works.

(holding the door

open for her)

I'll meet you at the train?

JOYCE

I don't remember saying yes.

NICK

I don't remember you saying no.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

JOYCE

They want your autograph.

NICK

Who am I supposed to be?

JOYCE

This little guy thinks you're Robert

Redford... the other one thinks

you're Charles Bronson...

NICK

Tell them I'm not.

JOYCE

They'll never go away.

JOYCE

Mick Jagger?

NICK

I'm sorry, Ichiro.  I lost it last

night.  I shouldn't have hit you.

NICK

What's in the box?

ICH

(still not facing

him)

For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese,

ham... If you come to apologize for

interrupting his meeting, Sugai may

feel obligated to see you.

NICK

So I bring some cheese?

JOYCE

Gifts are expected here.

NICK

Hey, Ich... Thanks.  I'm glad you're

here.  I mean it.

NICK

(impatiently)

They took the gift an hour ago.

JOYCE

(certain it's bad

news)

All's not lost.  There's a famous

temple here.  We could chant.

NICK

We're in?

JOYCE

The cheese...

JOYCE

(to Nick)

Just you.

SUGAI

I'll spare you the ritual.

NICK

This supposed to impress me?

SUGAI

Pick it up.  Look at it.

SUGAI

Seven years work by the finest

engraver.  Mass produced,

sequentially numbered.  The best

there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.

NICK

I'm impressed.  But let's use the

short form.  I'm looking for --

SUGAI

-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of

my partners.  One in New York, one

at the printing plant.

NICK

I don't drink tea.

SUGAI

I took Kobo from the street.  I gave

him a home, a future... But my ways

were too slow for him... I served

seven years in prison for my boss

when I was a young man.  Kobo

wouldn't serve seven minutes for his

Oyabun.

(sipping his tea)

He was supposed to take over this

syndicate when I retired.

NICK

I want him.

SUGAI

He'll be dealt with.

SUGAI

Our associates in New York were

close to closing a deal with us.

NICK

The families who control the

casinos?

SUGAI

Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your

criminals don't understand the words

'honor' and 'duty'... We can't

afford not to deal with them.

SUGAI

Imagine if your families could pay

their gambling and drug debts with

perfect counterfeit bought for cents

on the dollar.

NICK

The Feds would be onto you in a

month.

SUGAI

Not with these bills.  And even if

it only took them six months, do you

know what our profit margin would

be?

NICK

Why tell me this?

SUGAI

The other plate is currently in New

York, in the hands of Kobo's man.

Find it for me.

NICK

You trust me?

SUGAI

I'll pay you.

NICK

(indicating the

counterfeit bills)

With these?

SUGAI

Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion.

Whatever you want.  You know the

city and the police.

NICK

If I say no?

SUGAI

You're smarter than Kobo.  You know

the price of deceit.  Think about

it.

NICK

I don't have to.

NICK

I have ten hours to grab my man.

NICK (O.S.)

You won't get hurt.

CUT TO:

ICH

No...

NICK

Let's go.  Him first.

ICH

Nick, you can't do this.

NICK

It's done.

(to Joyce)

You don't have to come.

CUT TO:

NICK

Explain to them.  They shoot me,

they kill you.

(Sugai hesitates)

DO IT!

NICK

Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.

ICH

No.

NICK

Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work

with me.

ICH

You don't know what you're doing.

NICK

Start it.

ICH

(terrified)

I can't...

JOYCE

Slide over.

CUT TO:

NICK

(to Ich)

Where's somewhere safe?

JOYCE

(angrily)

You came up with the first part.

CUT TO:

SUGAI

Kobo will meet me here tomorrow.

Ten a.m.

NICK

Good.

SUGAI

He'll find out you took me.  I'm

unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of

us.  You don't stand a chance.

NICK

Not if we're careful.

CUT TO:

JOYCE

You're out of your mind.  I'm

leaving.

JOYCE

You'll get Ich killed.

NICK

No one's keeping him here.

JOYCE

Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me

this is all just about Charlie.

It's not.

NICK

Why would you care?

JOYCE

Bastard...

JOYCE

Let go.

JOYCE

You're out of your mind.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JOYCE

I still think you're a bastard.

NICK

What if I chant?

JOYCE

Wouldn't help.

(beat)

Watch out for Ich.

CUT TO:

NICK

Better wake him up.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SUGAI

(in Japanese)

Contact your associate in New York

and tell him to hand my plate over

to Abolofia.

SUGAI

You have betrayed the syndicate and

personally dishonored me.  I would

rather the deal fell through than...

KOBO

No... I'll arrange it.

DISSOLVE TO:

SUGAI

Abolofia's person has received the

plate.  It's done.

SUGAI

(in Japanese)

I wanted you to see him like this.

GIRL

(in Japanese)

Let him go, father.

GIRL

(in Japanese)

You're too old...

SUGAI

(in Japanese)

That's enough.

NICK (O.S.)

That wasn't our deal.

SUGAI

You want him dead too.

NICK

After a court convicts him.  He

belongs to me.

SUGAI

(looking at Nick)

If anything happens to Abolofia or

my plate, detective...

CUT TO:

NICK

Just one, compadre... Kampai.

ICH

Kampai.

NICK

It took 12 years to make it, you

could take five minutes to drink it.

NICK

You did great, Ichiro.

ICH

I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.

(smiling)

I like him waiting.

ICH

Needs ice.

KOBO

Ugly... A couple of thousand years

they've been bound by these little

rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid.

Ugly little lives...

NICK

Save it, I already took the tour.

KOBO

You are a lucky man.  Where you come

from a man can stand out.  It's

expected.  Here a man is made to

look a fool for standing out.

KOBO

I like your friend, Joyce.  You're

lucky.

NICK

Guess I'm on a roll.

KOBO

She's such a long way home for you.

NICK

Time, I've got plenty of.

NICK

(helping him up)

Hey, hey, come on, blow...

KOBO

(matter-of-factly)

This is my stop.

NICK

I'm amused.

KOBO

Don't be.

KOBO

I have her.

KOBO

(matter-of-factly)

I'll kill her.

KOBO

I want the plate from your pal,

Sugai.  When you get it, you get

her.

NICK

Sugai won't give it to me, you know

that.

KOBO

Then take it from him.

NICK

Ichiro?!

CUT TO:

NICK

Where's Ohashi?

NICK

What the hell are you doing?!

CUT TO:

OHASHI

Your plane leaves at six.  Two

officers will escort you.

NICK

For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your

help.  Let me out of here!

OHASHI

You had my help, detective.

NICK

If anything happens to her while I'm

here --

OHASHI

-- Do you know where she is,

detective?  Do you know how to find

her?  Even where to start?  We will

find them.

NICK

I have to get to Sugai.

OHASHI

Goodbye, officer.

NICK

OHASHI!

NICK

(yelling at the top

of his lungs)

OHASHI!!

CUT TO:

KOBO

(in Japanese)

Yes.  Do it.

CUT TO:

ICH (O.S.)

I'll tell you one thing.  You can't

solve a thing sitting on your ass.

CUT TO:

NICK

I was ready to have your ass for

taking off on me.

ICH

I followed them.  An hour from the

train station.

NICK

How many men?

ICH

I couldn't tell.

NICK

Joyce?

ICH

I don't know.

NICK

We need the plate to negotiate with.

NICK

You know, Ichiro, you just burned

your bridges.

ICH

Rest.

DISSOLVE TO:

ICH

Someone attacked him.

NICK

Now we've got nothing to negotiate

with.

CUT TO:

NICK

Joyce told me about your family.

It's tough...

ICH

Thank you.

(beat)

You have one?

NICK

A wife.  She left.

ICH

I'm sorry.

NICK

Me too.

DISSOLVE TO:

NICK

Let's go.

NICK

What's that for?

ICH

Luck.

NICK

Thanks.

ICH

You know, Nick, we can't lose.

NICK

(stopping)

Why's that?

ICH

Because we're the biggest things to

hit this town since Godzilla.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ICH

What are you going to do?

KOBO

Still on your knees, Nick?

KOBO

There's nothing you can do for me

anymore.  I have the plate.  Sugai's

dead.  No there is something.

KOBO

You can tell me who I should shoot

first.

NICK

(to Ich)

You all right?

ICH

Yes...

NICK

(to Joyce)

Call for help.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KOBO

(slowly)

Bang... bang...

KOBO

... You're dead.

NICK

Keep the change.

FADES TO BLACK.

ICH

Constable Ichiro Matsumoto presents

captured prisoner Kobo, Chief

Inspector Ohashi.

OHASHI

Inspector Ohashi will take charge of

the prisoner.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NICK

Can't make you change your mind?

JOYCE

Last time you asked me to come along

I nearly got a hole in my head.

NICK

Might be different in New York.

JOYCE

Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find

out.

NICK

I'd like that.

ICH

You can do it.

ICH

Louder, pal, louder.

NICK

Joyce, give the assistant Chief

Inspector a drink, would you?

SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

OLIVER

... Remember, counterfeiting is the

Feds.  They'll be all over

Abolofia's place.  Stick tight.

You I.D. the other plate, he does

real time.

NICK

Right.

OLIVER

(still not facing

him)

You know, Nick, if you'd held on to

that plate, you could've been a very

rich man.

NICK

Never crossed my mind.

OLIVER

Be careful on the run.

CUT TO:

SERGEANT

Saddle up.  Hard team in the first

unit.  Conklin, your RMP awaits.

NICK

Sure you want to come?  Probably

better than the Greyline Tour.

ICH

You wouldn't make it without me.

ICH

Think we'll get him, Nick?

NICK

We can't lose.

ICH

How can you be so sure?

NICK

Cause you're the biggest thing to

hit this town since...

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END
