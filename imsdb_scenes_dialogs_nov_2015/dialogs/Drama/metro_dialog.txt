SHOOTING DRAFT

TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

...at the top of the stretch it's

Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack

coming on... Cozy Girl by a length,

Backtrack closing...

ROPER

Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...

TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

At the eighth pole it's Cozy Girl by

half a length... Backtrack closing...

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

One-one-four to Roper.

ROPER

Dig in, Cozy Girl...

(into the radio)

Roper go.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

One-four, Roper. Code 2.C.P. 4th and

Grand.

TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy

Girl and Backtrack...

ROPER

I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.

ROPER

Stay up there, Girl...

TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now

a head...

ROPER (V.O.)

Where's the damn wire?!

TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

Here comes the wire... and...

Backtrack gets up in the last jump.

Cozy girl a very game second.

ROPER (V.O.)

SHIT!

KIMURA

Hi, Roper.

ROPER

Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?

KIMURA

The suspect came in shortly after

the bank opened. Botched robbery. A

teller hit the silent alarm. He took

seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard.

He's still alive. So far he's asked

for...

ROPER

...a car.

KIMURA

That's right, and a plane waiting at

the airport. If he doesn't...

ROPER

...get 'em, he's going to start

shooting hostages in five minutes...

KIMURA

That's right.

ROPER

What's the suspect's name?

KIMURA

Earl.

ROPER

Hello, guys.

BAFFERT

Hello, Roper. Glad you could join

us.

ROPER

Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl?

BAFFERT

This guy is no genius.

ROPER

They're not usually graduate students.

BAFFERT

SWAT wants to go in.

ROPER

What's the rush? They haven't killed

anybody yet this week?

ROPER

We got a guy who's probably on drugs.

He's got a record of 459's and he

was busted on possession. But he's

never been busted on a major felony.

What's his demeanor?

KIMURA

Well he's a little fucking agitated --

he ripped the phone out.

ROPER

I have to go face to face.

BAFFERT

No -- you can't do that.

ROPER

You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of

them's wounded -- We don't know how

bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone

out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to

the head of a female hostage. If

SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna

lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go

in. Maybe I can see what's going on

in there.

BAFFERT

I don't know.

ROPER

He's never offed anybody. His rap

doesn't show any violence.

BAFFERT

Not that we know of.

ROPER

We don't know how much time we have.

If I can get in to talk to him --

maybe we won't lose anyone.

BAFFERT

Maybe we can get a throw phone in

there.

KIMURA

SWAT says it's broken -- The perp in

the last situation rendered it

inoperable.

BAFFERT

What do you mean?

KIMURA

He urinated on it and shorted out

the circuits.

ROPER

We gonna stand here and talk about

it or let the guy in there bleed to

death.

(beat... beat)

Give me a dozen donuts.

FORBES

What do you think he's got in the

bag?

MCCALL

Donuts.

FORBES

You can't take a guy down with a

donut.

ROPER

Hi, Earl, I'm Scott Roper. Wanna

donut? I ate the glazed but there's

a bunch of chocolate and a --

ROPER

I'm a negotiator, Earl. I don't carry

a weapon.

EARL

Where's the car?

ROPER

I need to get something straight

first.

ROPER

Who's the manager?

MANAGER

I am.

ROPER

When did you start keeping longer

hours?

MANAGER

Last spring.

ROPER

Really! Because I've been thinking

of moving to this branch. It would

be really convenient for me --

EARL

HEY, SHUT UP!

EARL

Do you want me to start killing

people?!

ROPER

It's my job to see that no one gets

killed, Earl... Including you.

EARL

Then where's my FUCKING car!

ROPER

I'm getting it, Earl, but we have to

do this the right way.

ROPER

First I need you to point that gun

away from --

(to the teller)

What's your name?

TELLER

(voice trembling)

Debbie...

ROPER

Point the gun away from Debbie.

EARL

Debbie's brains are going to be

splattered all over the floor if I

don't see a car in five minutes!

ROPER

Alright! But let's be clear about

one thing. If you kill someone, I

can't help you. The SWAT guys will

take you out.

EARL

What are my chances of getting out

of here?

ROPER

Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a

bank in Daly City...

ROPER

How ya doin'?

ROPER

(to Earl)

...Cops gave him a car, and he lost

them on the freeway.

EARL

Really?

ROPER

Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally

your smartest criminals.

ROPER

He didn't kill anybody, though.

ROPER

This is gonna hurt.

EARL

Hey, leave him alone. What are you

doing?

ROPER

It's part of my negotiator's oath.

If there's an injured party and I

can help them, I'm duty bound by my

oath to do that. You can shoot me if

you want, but the next negotiator in

here is going to tell you the same

thing.

ROPER

I'll be right back, Earl. Point that

gun away from Debbie.

ROPER

(whispering to Jennings)

Give me your gun.

ROPER

I haven't had to shoot anyone in

three years.

JENNINGS

Why not keep the streak alive?

ROPER

Because this strung-out junkie is

too stupid to get out of this without

killing somebody.

EARL

(yelling)

HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING OUT

THERE!

ROPER

As a rule, I need one hostage released

as show of good faith.

ROPER

Give me Debbie.

EARL

Take the old guy.

ROPER

The Old Guy? What kind of show of

faith is that? I want Debbie.

EARL

Am I gettin' the car?

ROPER

You're gettin' the car.

EARL

Take them.

ROPER

You two, leave.

FORBES

This guy is good.

MCCALL

That's what they say.

ROPER

That was fine, Earl. Now I'm going

to get your car.

ROPER

Oh, there's one last thing.

EARL

What?!

ROPER

You want a convertible or hardtop?

ROPER

Hardtop.

ROPER

(without turning around)

Manual or automatic?

EARL

Automatic.

ROPER

You got it.

EARL

I give up! I give up!

RADIO

The situation is secured. Suspect in

custody. Repeat. Situation secured.

RONNIE

There's one for the front page.

ROPER

Ronnie, why are you torturing me? I

can't live without you.

RONNIE

Don't start.

ROPER

This baseball player you're going

out with...

(shaking his head)

He's no good for you.

RONNIE

Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He

makes two million a year, and he

worships me.

ROPER

I worship you.

RONNIE

You worship yourself.

ROPER

Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.

RONNIE

Greg.

ROPER

Did you know he's already got a bad

knee? In another 10 years you're

going to be pushing him around in a

wheelchair.

RONNIE

You know what I think? I think you

only want me now, because I'm with

somebody else.

ROPER

Who cares what you think. I want you

back and that's all that matters.

ROPER

Let me take you out tomorrow night...

Pleeease.

RONNIE

I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.

ROPER

(frowning)

This Greg is really getting in my

way.

ROPER

Please. I'm begging you.

RONNIE

Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.

ROPER

Hey, that's my car.

REPO MAN

Not anymore. Now it belongs to Silver

Hills Financial.

ROPER

Hey, Baffert, what's the story for

tonight?

BAFFERT

Floor seats.

ROPER

You're my hero.

BAFFERT

Dinner's on you.

ROPER

Deal.

SOLIS

He just walked into my office.

(looks over at Roper)

The Chief says, "Good work this

morning. Congratulations."

ROPER

Tell him to give me a raise.

SOLIS

(into the phone)

He says, "Thank you very much."

(a beat)

I'll discuss it with him right now...

Good-bye, Chief.

SOLIS

Roper.

ROPER

What?

SOLIS

Are you going to make this hard for

me?

ROPER

Depends. What's up?

SOLIS

There's been some concern about you

continuing to work without back-up.

ROPER

Define concern.

SOLIS

What if you die and no one can do

what you do as well as you do it?

ROPER

Your concern is heartwarming.

SOLIS

It's been decided that you take on

another partner and train him to be

able to take over for you.

ROPER

Is that what the guy in the Sunday

School suit is doing outside?

SOLIS

His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro

Captain agrees that he's their top

sharp-shooter and most likely to

succeed.

ROPER

Let me see that.

ROPER

Tested high on his intellectual

aptitude... Not as high as me but...

National marksman finalist... Attended

N. Y. C... Went to college. Very

impressive. F.B.I. sniper school...

Mayorial commendation.

ROPER

"Additional Skills": Biathelete,

marathoner, lip-reading, speaks

Spanish...

ROPER

Great, send him to the Marines. This

guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit

in two weeks.

SOLIS

You let us worry about that.

ROPER

Is there going to be an expression

of your appreciation?

SOLIS

(gloomily)

What kind of appreciation are we

talking about?

ROPER

The financial kind. I figure I'm

going to be working extra hours. All

sorts of overtime... training

sessions... Not to mention the extra

stress...

SOLIS

What do you think would be in order?

ROPER

Like ahh... I don't know...

(boldly)

Five thousand dollars.

SOLIS

(calmly)

Okay, I think I could swing that.

ROPER

(quickly)

And a car.

SOLIS

Hey, you just got a five thousand

dollar raise. Get a car of your own.

ROPER

You know you've got nothing but cars

down there in impound.

SOLIS

Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.

ROPER

(firmly)

The car is part of the deal.

SOLIS

What happened to your Trans Am?

ROPER

Repoed this morning.

SOLIS

(relenting)

I'll provide you with transportation.

ROPER

And even if this doesn't work, I

want all the money. These SWAT guys

don't have the temperament. They

don't have the background...

ROPER

(instant character

change)

Hey, glad to meet you. I've heard

nothing but good things about you...

MCCALL

Same here. I've watched you in action.

Very impressive.

ROPER

You've got a lot of hard work ahead

of you if you want to be a negotiator.

MCCALL

I'm ready to do it.

(a beat)

And I'm going to be here more than

two weeks.

ROPER

Don't go reading my lips, man. That's

an intrusion. Save that shit for the

sniper school. Comprende?

MCCALL

Sorry... Habit.

SOLIS

(intervening)

Let's move past this, gentlemen.

ROPER

We're already past it, aren't we,

Kevin?

MCCALL

If you say so.

SOLIS

Then you'll have to excuse me. I

have other work to do.

SOLIS

Roper...

SOLIS

About the transportation issue...

You check with the impound sergeant.

ROPER

You ever been in a hostage situation?

MCCALL

Only at the very end.

ROPER

How do you feel after a shooting.

MCCALL

(self-assured)

Like it had to be done.

ROPER

It rarely has to be done.

MCCALL

I've rarely shot anyone.

ROPER

SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.

MCCALL

(flatly)

I know.

ROPER

Try to remember that.

ROPER

Okay, "Dead Eye", lesson one...

ROPER

Extract that pen cap without touching

or moving the bottle.

MCCALL

What's the point of this?

ROPER

A little exercise in lateral thinking.

The obvious solution isn't always

the only solution... See you tomorrow.

BAFFERT

Mind if we make a stop on the way?

We busted Frank Antonucci on

possession. He gave us a lead on

that Polk Street jewelry heist.

ROPER

"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your

time. He'd tell you his granny was

in on the Kennedy assassination if

he could dodge a collar.

BAFFERT

I still gotta do it. Wasting time is

half my job.

ROPER

Yeah, okay.

BAFFERT

This SWAT guy might be a good idea.

He may be able to take a little

pressure off you. I worry about you.

ROPER

You worried about me, too? The chief's

worried about me. Solis is worried

about me. Maybe you guys should start

some kind of organization.

BAFFERT

Speaking of which. I saw you talking

to Ronnie this morning. Why can't

you get it back together with her.

You've gotta be out of your mind not

to get with that one.

ROPER

It's not me. It's her. She's going

out with this baseball player --

Greg Barnett.

BAFFERT

(impressed)

No shit! He's good!

ROPER

Fuck him. He swings at anything in

the dirt. I could strike him out.

BAFFERT

Don't give up on her. You're getting

to the age when you ought to be

thinking about these things.

ROPER

Yep, my rheumatism's been acting up.

BAFFERT

This is it. Space 742.

ROPER

Then he didn't say 742. He must have

said 724 or something, because this

can't be right.

ROPER

Oh man! What am I, Red Foxx? I'm not

riding in this shit. I can't roll in

no shit like this.

BAFFERT

Where's the stereo?

ROPER

Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?

BAFFERT

Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.

BAFFERT

Apartment 306.

ROPER

You want me to go up with you?

BAFFERT

Nah, It probably won't turn up

anything. I'm just gonna talk to

him.

ROPER

Good. I don't want to be late.

ROPER

You want anything on the game?

BAFFERT

What's the line?

ROPER

It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.

BAFFERT

I'll take half of your action.

KORDA

Who is it?

BAFFERT (V.O.)

It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the

San Francisco Police Department.

KORDA

What happened? Is there a problem?

BAFFERT

May I come in? I would just like to

ask you a couple of questions.

BAFFERT

Count Basie?

KORDA

Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What

They Used To Be", recorded July 30,

1945.

BAFFERT

Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.

BAFFERT

Where did you find an old recording

like that?

KORDA

Used record shop down on Turk Street.

I was in there looking for some Robert

Johnson.

(searching for the

name)

Memories... Memory Lane or

something...

BAFFERT

I've got to stop in there... Mr.

Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?

KORDA

You mean Frank who owns the bakery

down the street?

BAFFERT

No, this is a different Frank. This

is a man who deals in jewelry. Stolen

jewelry usually. You wouldn't know

anybody like that?

KORDA

I certainly wouldn't.

BAFFERT

Could I please have a little water?

KORDA

(the perfect host)

Of course.

BAFFERT

The reason I'm asking you is because

we arrested him with some stolen

jewelry. It was traced to the robbery

of a store down on Polk Street. He

said he was fencing it for you.

KORDA

(calmly)

There's obviously some mistake. I

have a cousin who has had run-ins

with the law.

KORDA

Perhaps for his own reasons he

entangled me in this... situation.

BAFFERT

This cousin of yours... What's his

name?

KORDA

(forthrightly)

Clarence Teal.

KORDA

Your cough seems to be better.

BAFFERT

Thank you.

BAFFERT

Well, I'm on my way to the game. I

appreciate your cooperation, Mr.

Korda.

KORDA

Lieutenant...

KORDA

Do you believe that story about Robert

Johnson...? That he made a deal with

the devil at the crossroads?

BAFFERT

Could be.

BAFFERT

(as the elevator

descends)

Hello, Judge Stone... This is

Lieutenant Samuel Baffert. I'm at a

suspect's residence. I'm requesting

a telephonic search warrant in

connection with an armed robbery at

a jewelry store. There's visible

evidence on the premises. Glassine

envelopes with jeweler's markings

were seen in the trash can...

BAFFERT

...I believe a full search of the

premises will turn up some stolen

property...

ROPER

(to the woman)

Get an ambulance!

SOLIS

(on the phone)

Yes sir. Every resource will be

brought to bear. We will find this

guy... Yeah, he's here now. I'll

tell him.

SOLIS

The chief says to tell you how sorry

he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a

good man.

ROPER

(still looking out

window)

He said he was just going up to talk

to him. He said...

(beat; turning to

Solis)

I want to be put on this case.

SOLIS

I can't do that.

ROPER

(emphatic)

I want to be put on this case.

SOLIS

You know I can't assign you to this.

You're much too close to it. You

were much too close to Sam. The

department will take care of it.

ROPER

Who's running it?

SOLIS

Roper...

ROPER

Who's running it!

SOLIS

Kimura and Glass will head the

investigation.

SOLIS

Scott. Go home. Get some sleep.

CUT TO:

ROPER

Hey, hey, hey...

ROPER

Anything on Korda so far?

KIMURA

Solis said to keep you clear of this.

ROPER

I don't give a damn what Solis said.

(to the detectives)

If you get a lead, I want to know.

RONNIE (O.S.)

Just a minute.

RONNIE

Hey.

ROPER

Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.

RONNIE

(like hell)

A little late for that, Scottie.

He's asleep.

(smells his breath)

Jack Daniels?

ROPER

I'm not drunk. Yet.

RONNIE

Maybe you should be.

ROPER

You heard.

RONNIE

Yeah. I'm sorry.

ROPER

Can I come in?

ROPER

That a new picture?

RONNIE

About 4 months old. I'm working in a

new style.

ROPER

Hey, Troy. How ya doin' boy?

(to Ronnie)

He heard my voice.

ROPER

How's the good dog. I miss you buddy.

You miss me?

ROPER

He misses me.

ROPER

I won't stay long. I had to talk to

someone.

RONNIE

(a bit surprised at

his openness)

You don't usually talk to anyone

when you're hurting.

ROPER

It was my fault. I was right

downstairs. I should have gone up

with him.

RONNIE

Scott, You can't save everyone.

ROPER

I've proved that, didn't I?

ROPER

Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.

RONNIE

(gentle)

What do you want from me?

ROPER

Something I guess I can't have

anymore.

RONNIE

Don't try to make me feel guilty.

The whole time we were together, you

went out of your way to prove you

didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for

one night, you need me again. I can't

do it. I can't be more than your

friend. Because I know what will

happen. In a few weeks you'll be

back on top, and you'll shut me out

just as soon as you don't need me

again.

ROPER

(surprised, hurt)

You think I didn't need you?

RONNIE

If you did, you never showed it.

ROPER

Ronnie...

ROPER

You expecting someone?

ROPER

This day just keeps getting better.

RONNIE

(soft)

They're on the table where you always

leave them.

GREG

Hey, baby, I thought maybe you were...

ROPER

I was just leaving.

RONNIE

Scottie... take care of yourself.

KORDA

If you weren't family I'd kill you.

KORDA

You told Antonucci that shit came

from me.

CLARENCE

So that we could get the best price.

He's got respect for you. He's gonna

try to lowball me, Mike.

KORDA

You fucking idiot! Why do you think

I use you?... To be a walking

advertisement.

CLARENCE

I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of

LaMarra flipping on anyone before.

He said he had the cops paid off.

Antonucci never flipped on anyone

before. He had the cops paid off.

KORDA

Not the fucking cop that showed up

at my door!

CLARENCE

What happened, Mike.

KORDA

You don't want to know.

CLARENCE

I'm sorry, Mike.

KORDA

God damn it! I still needed to case

that fucking store. It's too risky

to show my face now.

CLARENCE

I got a couple thousand bucks. You

could leave town.

KORDA

Leave town? They're going to know me

in fucking Des Moines now!...

(a beat)

They got over ten million in jewels

in that place. That's freedom, man.

I could go anywhere I want.

CLARENCE

Did you kill him, Mike?

CLARENCE

I'm sorry, Mike. I'm really sorry...

KORDA

It's not your fault you're stupid.

ROPER

(to Kimura and Glass)

What do you got on Korda?

KIMURA

We ran a search on relatives. He has

a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal.

Smalltime thief. Last known address

was on Pine Street. He moved out a

month ago. We've got a couple leads

on him to check out.

ROPER

(rapid fire)

Did you check out DMV for any vehicles

registration?

KIMURA

Being faxed over now.

ROPER

How about the record room for any

incident reports? He might be a

victim. We can get medical records.

Check with burglary detail and see

if anyone else knows him, knows his

habits.

KIMURA

Roper...

ROPER

And what about bars? We can talk to

neighbors to see what bars he

frequents.

KIMURA

Roper, we're into it...

SOLIS

We've had this conversation once,

Roper. You're not active on this

case.

SOLIS

It's in everyone's best interest.

ROPER

(softened)

You guys are doing good work.

MCCALL

I'm sorry about your friend. I had a

friend in SWAT killed. I know how it

can be.

ROPER

I appreciate your concern. Let's

leave it at that.

ROPER

I don't see much progress here.

ROPER

Very nice... You get an "A". Notice...

No force required. No damage.

SERGEANT

Roper, domestic disturbance at 472

6th Street. Possible hostage

situation.

ROPER

So, McCall, how come you ended up in

San Francisco?

MCCALL

They recruited me. Promised me fast

advancement.

ROPER

Recruited you from where?

MCCALL

National Marksman Competition.

ROPER

With your qualifications you must

have had a lot of offers. Why here?

MCCALL

Furthest point I could find from New

York.

ROPER

You don't like New York?

MCCALL

Spent my whole life there. I just

wanted to get out for a while.

ROPER

You'd never been out of New York?

MCCALL

Been to Toronto. My mother was born

there.

ROPER

How did you like Toronto?

MCCALL

It was okay.

ROPER

You're a real excitable sort, aren't

you?

MCCALL

You caught me on an "up" day.

(a beat)

How about you? How did you end up in

San Francisco?

ROPER

I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the

Bay Bridge and here I was.

(a beat)

So you're looking for "fast

advancement".

MCCALL

Is there something wrong with that?

ROPER

I'm not sure.

ROPER

Roper. Metro Division. Hostage

Negotiator. Give me the short version.

OFFICER #1

Husband came home. Found that guy

and his wife "in flagrante". Now

he's holding her at knife point.

ROPER

Which apartment?

OFFICER #1

That one with the bars on the windows.

ROPER

How are we gonna get him out of there?

MCCALL

We could fill it with water.

ROPER

(to Officer #1)

Have you evacuated anyone?

OFFICER #1

Only that floor.

ROPER

Is the hostage injured?

OFFICER #1

Don't know. She keeps screaming to

stay out. He keeps screaming to stay

out. We decided to stay out.

ROPER

Well, there's a good amount of

agreement on that.

MCCALL

I'll take "highground" until SWAT

gets here.

(surveying the area)

I can get a good sight-line from

that roof across the street.

ROPER

Remember, Quick Draw, we're trying

to limit the force here.

MCCALL

I know my job.

ROPER (V.O.)

I'm coming in. I'm not armed.

WIFE

(shrieking)

No, Raymond!

RAYMOND

(to Roper)

Stay the fuck out of here!

ROPER

I know how you feel, Ray.

RAYMOND

You don't know shit, and I suggest

you leave.

ROPER

I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my

negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the

room with the hostage, I have to

stay.

RAYMOND

You don't want to see what I'm going

to do to her.

ROPER

Let me show you something, Ray.

ROPER

Same thing happened to me, man. She

cheated on me, but I forgave her.

You know why?

RAYMOND

I ain't interested in your life story.

ROPER

Because I was partially to blame. I

wasn't around as much as I should

have been. I forgot how to love her.

RAYMOND

She's the one to blame. Not me.

ROPER

Ray, think about how she looked when

you married her. Think about how

happy you were. Don't lose that,

man. Don't give up everything.

RAYMOND

What am I giving up? I'm laid off

last year. I'm down to my last

unemployment check. I'm out on the

streets looking for work and this

bitch is banging some asshole in my

bed.

RAYMOND

I'm down at Consolidated and I'm

begging. I'm saying I'll take half

my pay. Eight years, man. I don't

even have to work the loading docks

anymore. I'll do maintenance. "We're

cutting back. We're streamlining,

Ray. West Central's running things

now. It's out of our hands" Fuck

them! Fuck them! FUCK THEM!

(deep sigh)

I'm gonna kill her and then I'm gonna

kill myself, 'cause I don't wanna

live anymore.

ROPER

Ray, if you walk out of here with

me, I'll get you a job.

RAYMOND

Doing what? Cleaning toilets?

ROPER

I can't guarantee you what it will

be. But I swear on my life, I'll

find you work.

RAYMOND

And why the fuck would you do that

for me?

ROPER

Not for you, Ray. For me. A close

friend of mine was killed this week.

The way I figure it, I stop you from

doin' what you said, I'm one up on

body count.

RAYMOND

Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?

ROPER

My name's Scott Roper.

RAYMOND

I need my coat.

ROPER

NOOOO!!

ROPER

WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

ROPER

Do you think because the police

department issued you a sniper rifle,

it makes you God! What the fuck goes

on in your head?

MCCALL

SWAT is a lifesaving unit, remember?

I just saved a life. Yours.

ROPER

(still angry)

You think I've never had a gun pulled

on me?! You think every fucking time

someone pulls a gun they use it?!

MCCALL

Eighty-five percent of domestic

disturbances of this nature end in

murder/suicide.

ROPER

(fiercely)

Not the ones I'm at.

MCCALL

Sorry. My mistake.

INVESTIGATOR

Looks like a clean shoot. Go home

and get some rest.

ROPER

Come on. Let's go for a drink.

MCCALL

I don't really like to drink.

ROPER

You have to. It's a tradition.

MCCALL

Well, if I have to, I have to.

ROPER

You got a girlfriend?

MCCALL

Why? You like my ass?

ROPER

Better than your pool game.

ROPER

You wouldn't want to put a small

wager on this, would you?

MCCALL

I don't gamble.

MCCALL

Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.

ROPER

You living together?

MCCALL

She's back in Jersey... going to

graduate school.

ROPER

Explain how that works.

MCCALL

She's going to come here when she

graduates and then we're gonna get

married.

ROPER

She grow up in Livingtston, too?

MCCALL

(as if that were

unthinkable)

No, no, no...

(a beat)

She's from Hoboken.

ROPER

Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long

for companionship with her such a

long way away in New Jersey?

MCCALL

We see each other every couple of

months.

ROPER

Every couple of months, huh?

ROPER

That's a lot of commitment. I admire

that.

MCCALL

Do you really?

ROPER

No. Actually I think it's fucking

crazy, I don't know if I could do

it.

MCCALL

Thanks for clearing that up.

(a beat)

I hear your former girlfriend is

going out with Greg Barnett.

ROPER

Where did you hear that?

MCCALL

Around. Barnett's tough competition.

ROPER

Yeah, well that's a sore subject,

and therefore out of bounds to a

young sprout of a hostage negotiator

under my tutelage.

ROPER

Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should

have been lesson one. Never exchange

yourself for a hostage.

MCCALL

I think I can handle that one.

ROPER

Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.

ROPER

Zack, another round.

ROPER

My partner gave himself in exchange

for a ten year old girl. He got caught

in the crossfire. Two dead. My partner

and the bad guy...

(takes the last sip)

Weird thing is, if he was alive,

he'd probably do it again.

(a beat)

Some people never learn.

ROPER

You think you can learn, McCall?

MCCALL

I think so.

MCCALL

I'm Officer McCall, what's going on?

BAD GUY

What the fuck do you think is going

on, turdhead? I'm about to waste

everyone in this place.

MCCALL

H... how can I help you? Tell me

what...

(looks off to his

right)

I feel stupid talking to a dummy.

ROPER

What did you think? I'm going to let

you practice on real people?

ROPER

First things is, don't say, "What's

going on?" Everybody knows what's

going on. I come into this situation,

I say,

(addressing the

mannequin)

"I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's

good. I'm here to help you."

(turns back to McCall)

Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate.

If you're thinking, talk while you're

thinking, or else he's going to think

you're plotting. Which you are. If

he thinks you're plotting, you're

going to make him nervous. You don't

want him nervous. Got that?

MCCALL

No.

ROPER

It'll come. Try again.

MCCALL

My name's McCall. I'm a hostage

negotiator. I'm here to help you.

ROPER (V.O.)

How are you going to help me?

MCCALL

Tell me what you need.

ROPER (V.O.)

I need you to bring me the scumbag

who ran off with my wife so I can

cut off his nuts.

MCCALL

(hesitantly)

I can't do that.

ROPER (V.O.)

Then get out of my face you worthless

piece of frogshit.

MCCALL

Is all the name calling necessary.

ROPER

Nah, I just throw that in because I

enjoy it.

MCCALL

(exasperated)

So what do I say to this guy?

ROPER

You could say something like,

(addressing the dummy)

"Tell me what the scumbag's name is.

Maybe we can work something out."

MCCALL

What? Bring somebody in so he can

cut his nuts off?

ROPER

If you want to be a successful

negotiator, you've got to learn to

lie.

MCCALL

I'm not good at lying.

ROPER

Get good at it.

MCCALL

It's against my nature.

ROPER

You know the ten commandments?

MCCALL

Yes.

ROPER

What's the first commandment?

MCCALL

Thou shall have no other God before

me.

ROPER

Okay, forget that. What's the main

one.

MCCALL

You tell me.

ROPER

Thou shall not kill... You've killed,

right?

MCCALL

Yes.

ROPER

Why?

MCCALL

To save lives.

ROPER

So why would you hesitate to lie to

save lives?

ROPER

Let's try it again.

MCCALL

My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.

ROPER (V.O.)

Okay, stop.

ROPER

Close your eyes.

ROPER

What did you see?

MCCALL

(rapid-fire)

A dirtbag behind the counter holding

a sawed-off. A Berretta nine

millimeter in his belt. A female

hostage, red dress, on the floor in

front of the cereal display. Male

hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt,

three feet to her right. Another

male hostage, white pants, green

shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the

magazine rack. A female dirtbag with

a gun under her shirt, sitting against

the beer cooler, trying to pass

herself off as a hostage, and there's

a special on toilet-paper, four for

a buck twenty-nine.

ROPER

Very good. You've got good eyes.

That's important.

MCCALL

Was that your partner?

MCCALL

Why did he do it?

ROPER

(quietly)

Because he knew the little girl had

zero chance of survival and his

chances would be a little better...

We had a plan, but SWAT opened up

too early. He got caught in the

crossfire.

(a sad beat)

Let's move on... Notice this. Always

use the eyes to keep the connection.

It almost like hypnosis. That's the

most important thing. Create a

connection. You're always on their

side...

ROPER

You know why I like the track?

MCCALL

You're a compulsive gambler?

ROPER

Because there are a multitude of

possibility's. Everything is there

to see if you know what to look for.

You have to read the conditions,

just like in a hostage situation.

ROPER

See the four horse. Dropping in class.

No works. Front wraps. Looks like

he's broken down. But notice the

woman in the sun hat. She's the owner.

She wouldn't have come if her horse

was broken down. He's live. We use

him.

ROPER

See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He

doesn't want to run today. Cross him

off... Now the Six looks good. On

his toes. Coat shiny. This

trainer/jockey combo does well. We

can't leave him out.

(turns to McCall)

What do you think?

MCCALL

I have two words for you... Seek

help.

ROPER

I have three words for you... Ex-ac-

ta.

ROPER

I bought you a four-six exacta box.

You owe me twenty bucks.

MCCALL

(puzzled)

I do.

GAMBLER

Hey, Roper.

ROPER

How you doin', Marv?

ROPER

We need the 4 and 6 to finish to

first and second.

MCCALL

(no enthusiasm)

Fine.

MCCALL

I'm told that newspaper photographer

is your former girlfriend.

ROPER

Ronnie... Yeah, so.

MCCALL

Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?

ROPER

So what do you want?... An autograph.

MCCALL

I don't know why she'd pick him over

you.

MCCALL

(straight-faced)

I'm just practicing my lying.

ROPER

Still needs work.

MCCALL

(downcast)

You're right. I'll never be as good

a liar as you.

TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

And they're racing!

ROPER

Okay, we're in good shape. We're in

good shape.

MCCALL

The 6 horse is last.

ROPER

That's okay. That's his style.

MCCALL

To run last?

ROPER

To run late!

ROPER

The favorite's fading. I told you he

wasn't going to run today... The

four horse has got the lead!

MCCALL

(cynically)

The 6 horse is still last.

ROPER

He'll be running at the quarter pole.

ROPER (V.O.)

There he goes.

MCCALL

They need to run first and second?

ROPER

Yeah, first and second.

ROPER

Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell.

MCCALL

COME ON RUSSELL!...

(to Roper)

Who the fuck's Russell?!

ROPER

The jockey!

MCCALL

COME ON, RUSSELL!

MCCALL

We won!

ROPER

(disheartened)

We lost.

MCCALL

(confidently)

We won.

ROPER

How much you wanna bet?

MCCALL

You want to bet on whether you won

your bet? This is getting sick.

ROPER

Yes!

ROPER

That's eight hundred bucks.

MCCALL

How long you been coming here?

ROPER

About six years. My partner took me.

MCCALL

Is it always like this?

ROPER

Occasionally you lose.

ROPER

(into the phone)

Roper here.

(he listens)

I'm on my way.

ROPER

We gotta go.

SOLIS

We're working on that, Joe. These

things aren't quite that simple.

MCCALL

This does not look good.

ROPER

See this. Solis has me driving the

shit-mobile, and he picked this up

straight out of impound for fourteen

grand. Probably worth thirty.

MCCALL

Police corruption. It's everywhere.

SOLIS

This will take time to setup. I'll

have to get authorizations.

(he listens)

Okay, you relax, and I'll --

ROPER

What do we got?

SOLIS

32 minutes ago the silent alarm went

off, then the fire alarm. A unit was

a block away, and the suspect got

trapped inside.

ROPER

Any verification on numbers.

SOLIS

We've only seen and talked to one

suspect. He calls himself "Joe".

There's two jewelers, two salespeople,

the manager, a security guard, and

an elderly woman. This particular

store is where they do a lot of

jewelry making and repair. They have

anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw

stones on any given day, so they

sure as shit didn't just wander in.

They knew what they were coming for.

ROPER

What have you promised them?

SOLIS

Just that I'd talk to my superiors.

ROPER

Any good points of entry?

MCCALL

The place is designed to be a vault.

ROPER

(into the phone)

My name's Roper. How are you people

doing in there?

(he listens)

Solis is off the job now, Joe. I'm

the guy authorized to give you

whatever you want.

(listens)

That's right, but first I need to

come down there to talk to you.

KORDA

You don't have to come here.

ROPER

Yes, I do. That way there's no

misunderstandings. I need to make

sure no one's hurt, then we can take

care of business.

KORDA (V.O.)

Alright, Roper. You want to come...

come.

ROPER

Good. I won't be armed. We gotta

operate on trust here. We're going

to wrap this up and have you guys

out of here as soon as possible.

KORDA

(warningly)

Stay there.

ROPER

I'm going to put my hands down, okay.

KORDA

Are you in charge, Roper?

ROPER

Yep.

KORDA

I want a car. Like a four wheel drive.

I want it in perfect condition. I

want a uniformed cop to drive it up

right here. I want him to leave the

engine running and walk to the end

of the street. Then we'll come out.

I don't want any remote control

devices in it. I know all the tricks.

If it's not in perfect condition,

and I mean if its even low on wiper

fluid, I'm going to kill somebody

and we're gonna start again.

KORDA

I want a plane waiting at the airport.

I'll tell them where I want to go

when I get there.

ROPER

Is that all?

KORDA

For now that's all.

ROPER

You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you

to do something for me. Let me take

a look around inside. Make sure

everybody's okay.

KORDA

No. You just do shit for me right

now.

ROPER

Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think

you could give me something to cement

the deal... One hostage.

KORDA

I'll give you something.

KORDA

In fifteen minutes it'll be a bigger

piece. I assume there are no

"misunderstanding".

ROPER

I understand you completely.

ROPER

(flatly)

We're going to have to take this guy

out.

SOLIS

Can't we wear him down?

ROPER

I believe there's at least one

fatality in there already. The fire

alarm was probably set off by gunfire.

I believe he's working alone, both

from his conversation and the fact

that he wouldn't come out beyond the

doorway. He was holding a gun on the

hostages while he was talking to me.

His demeanor is calm and controlled,

that's what really scares me. The

other bad news is that he also

indicated a familiarity with our

techniques.

(a beat)

So, do you want to go in or wait for

him to come out?

MCCALL

Let him come out. Too many unknowns

in there.

MCCALL

When we drive up the car, make sure

it's at an angle about three feet

from the curb.

(to SWAT Captain)

Put our best man "highground", Twenty

degree down angle.

SWAT CAPTAIN

Have Anderson prep it and notify us

when he's on line.

SOLIS

I feel this thing going sideways on

us.

ROPER

There is some good news. He's wearing

a ski mask, so he's protecting his

identity and hasn't determined to

kill all the hostages...

(big pause)

Yet.

KORDA

Drag them behind the counter.

WOMAN CUSTOMER

I'm not staying here another minute.

SALESGIRL #1

(panicky)

No, Mrs. Dotson.

KORDA

Come here, hag.

MANAGER

Leave her alone!

KORDA

You're a brave one, aren't you?

SALESGIRL #2

(pleading)

Sit down, Doug.

KORDA

If she's not conscious when it's

time to leave, I'll have to kill

her.

ROPER

Okay. Time to give this fucker a

call.

ROPER

This fucker's not answering.

MCCALL

There's your answer. He's smart.

ROPER

He's cutting down the visibility.

MCCALL

And doing a very good job of it.

MCCALL

Come on. Give us one clean shot.

SWAT CAPTAIN

(into his radio)

All positions, you have the green

light.

MCCALL

They're out.

ROPER

It's Korda.

MCCALL

They switched clothes.

ROPER

(urgently)

Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

ROPER

Shit! Where'd that shot come from?

Hold your fire!

MCCALL

He's got the girl.

ROPER

Damnit!

ROPER

(grabbing the keys;

to Solis)

Are these yours?

SOLIS

Yeah, they are but...

ROPER

(to McCall)

Come on!

SOLIS

Roper, what are you going to do?

Don't take my...

SOLIS

...car.

MCCALL

Suspect heading west on Sutter now

passing Jones. Can we get an

intercept?

VOICE (V.O.)

R-32-David. We are proceeding south

on Hyde. Will intercept.

MCCALL

What the fuck is going on.

ROPER

I don't know, but I've got to get on

there.

MCCALL

You're crazy.

ROPER

Pull up alongside.

ROPER

Sorry, go.

ROPER

Give me one reason why I shouldn't

kill you right here.

ROPER

You know Sam Baffert was a friend of

mine. He had a wife... and he had a

daughter.

KORDA

I don't give a shit about you or

your fucking friends.

KORDA

You can't kill me like this.

ROPER

What if you and me got into a

struggle... and my gun went off?

ROPER

Could I kill you then?

(beat, beat)

Could I kill you then?

MCCALL

Roper! Put it down!... Put it down

man, we got him.

(beat)

Come on... Put it down.

ROPER

We do this shit by the book, but you

ain't gonna be smiling.

RONNIE

You weren't at the press conference.

ROPER

I wanted to get this out of the way.

RONNIE

You got a bet on the game tonight?

ROPER

As a matter of fact, I do.

RONNIE

It's already started.

ROPER

I was going to catch the last half

on TV.

RONNIE

Good-night.

ROPER

You having dinner with Mr. Baseball?

RONNIE

Greg is on a road trip. I was just

going to make some pasta.

ROPER

That kind with the garlic and the

oil that I like so much?

RONNIE

No. The kind from Kraft, with the

macaroni and the cheese.

ROPER

I've been craving that stuff all

week.

RONNIE

And it's hard to get.

RONNIE

Just dinner.

ROPER

What do you think?

RONNIE

Mmm, needs a little something.

ROPER

What are you talking about? This is

it. This is the stuff right here.

(beat; he tastes)

Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.

RONNIE

Yeah that's it.

ROPER

Why don't you just stick your finger

in and stir it up.

RONNIE

(laughing)

Scottie...

ROPER

What would you say if I quit gambling?

RONNIE

I'd say you'd be miserable... It's

not the gambling. It's what the

gambling got in the way of. The track

is where you'd take your troubles

instead of sharing them with me...

RONNIE

Scottie, remember the day you lost

that hostage in union square. You

came over that night and we made

mad, crazy love. But I didn't even

know what happened... 'til I heard

it on the news the next morning.

ROPER

It's because I wanted to keep you

away from that world.

RONNIE

It's not that world. It's your world.

It's part of who you are.

ROPER

(beat)

Veronica, it's not easy for me... I

don't know if I can change overnight.

But what I'm telling you is that I

want to share everything with you,

because I don't ever want to be

without you again.

ROPER

What about Greg? What are you gonna

tell him?

RONNIE

It's okay. We broke up.

ROPER

(surprised)

When?

RONNIE

Just now.

CLARENCE

How ya doin', man?

KORDA

You gotta do something for me...

this fucker, Roper, he's gotta

girlfriend. She works at the

newspaper. I want you to take care

of her.

CLARENCE

Hey, Michael, that's not my thing.

KORDA

You gotta do this for me. I'm in

here because of you.

CLARENCE

Man, what's this about? Ya know, you

were robbing a store. It wasn't

personal. It was his job.

KORDA

(exploding)

Fuck you! You know what he did to

me?!...

KORDA

He held a gun to my head and said he

should kill me right then... He made

me...

KORDA

You do this for me Clarence.

CLARENCE

Don't make do it, Mike.

KORDA

Are you going to turn on me too? Who

helped you when you were strung out?

Who gave you money? Who bailed you

out of jail?

CLARENCE

I won't get away with it.

KORDA

Nobody knows who you are. Make it

look like a robbery.

ROPER

Hi, I'm going to stop at the corner

for some wine.

RONNIE

How's Paco doing?

ROPER

He was going nuts at the park. He

met this very attractive poodle.

They made plans to meet again next

weekend.

RONNIE

Okay, dinner will be ready when you

get here.

ROPER

You okay?!

ROPER

(to Paco)

Stay.

CABBY

Jesus Christ. What was he doing?!

CABBY

There was no way I could miss him.

CABBY

This isn't my fault.

ROPER

Shut the fuck up!

ROPER

Get on your radio and get the police

here.

ROPER

If you try again to hurt me or anyone

I know, I'm going to have you killed.

KORDA

What in the world are you talking

about, Mr. Roper?

ROPER

Here's a picture of your cousin

Clarence. That gentleman standing

over him is the coroner.

KORDA

I used to have an apartment, a car,

jewelry. I had a fucking eight

thousand dollar watch. Now look what

I have.

KORDA

You're threatening me? You think I

give a fuck? You think you can scare

me off?

(a laugh)

Why don't you come in here and kick

my ass? Get some of your guard friends

in here to help. I'd like that.

KORDA

(smirking)

He really shook you up, didn't he?...

I've got ten years worth of appeals

to figure out how to fuck with you.

Who knows? Maybe some scumbag lawyer

will get me out on a technicality.

KORDA

You came here to threaten me? That's

a laugh. Maybe you should BEG me...

Go ahead. Get down on your knees.

ROPER

You motherfucker, I swear I'll kill

you!

MCCALL

I'm here to help you.

MCCALL

I'm here to help you. Talk to me.

SOLIS

We got a situation at the V.A.

Hospital. The responding officer has

requested a negotiator.

MCCALL

Where's Roper?

SOLIS

He's on his way. Get over there.

VET #1

(rambling incoherently)

I can't fight this technology. They

have microprocessors made in totally

sterile environments. I've seen those

places. Everyone is dressed in white.

It's like paper clothing, man. They're

not even human.

VET #2

Dave, don't do this, bro. Pull me

in. We'll do a few laps in the park

and figure out some other way.

VET #1

I can't help this, man. Do you have

any idea what those microchips look

like? How small they are when they

put them in your brain?

OFFICER #4

When we got here, he was already

doing his balancing act. I was talking

to him, but it made him more agitated

so I backed off.

MCCALL

Why is he up there?

OFFICER #4

Something about a microchip in his

brain.

MCCALL

Who is he?

NURSE HERRIN

David Adler. He likes to be called

Dave. The other guy is Walter

Sinclair.

VOICE (V.O.)

Somebody help me out here. Somebody

stop him.

NURSE HERRIN

What are you waiting for?

MCCALL

Another negotiator is on his way.

NURSE HERRIN

We can't wait for another negotiator.

You have to do something.

MCCALL

What about the doctors?

NURSE HERRIN

He hates all the doctors. He says

they're in on the conspiracy.

VET #1 (O.S.)

Where is everybody? He's going to

kill me!

DAVE

Get the fuck out of here!

MCCALL

I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help

you, D... Dave.

DAVE

You can't help me, man.

WALTER

He's high on something, man. Give

him some thorazine or something.

DAVE

No one can help me. They're

controlling my mind.

MCCALL

Who's controlling your mind?

DAVE

Whoa!... The government. They control

everybody's mind. You're too fucking

stupid to know that?

MCCALL

This has nothing to do with Walter.

DAVE

They want Walter dead!

MCCALL

Dave, look at me.

MCCALL

Tell me what's wrong.

DAVE

Particles, man. I feel them all the

time. I feel them in my arms and

legs man, that's how they punish me.

MCCALL

How can I help you with the particles?

DAVE

It's not just the particles man,

it's the whole fucking machine, this

is how they get assassins to operate.

It's been this way since the cuban

missile crisis.

MCCALL

(blurting out)

They have less power over you if you

look into my eyes.

DAVE

Huh?

DAVE

Huh?

ROPER

Whata ya got?

FIREMAN

Some nuts dangling a guy over the

edge in a wheelchair.

ROPER

Can you get a net out here?

FIREMAN

Negative. It's 14 floors up. No nets

gonna hold a fall from that high up.

MCCALL

We've been onto them for a long time.

MCCALL

Let me show you something.

MCCALL

See this. I'm jamming them, Dave.

I'm jamming their frequency so they

can't control your mind anymore.

Don't you feel that? You don't have

to do what they say.

WALTER

He's jamming them, Dave. Pull me

back in.

MCCALL

You see, the particles are gone,

they can't punish you anymore.

DAVE

Tell my dad.

MCCALL

Tell him what, what do you want me

to tell him?

DAVE

Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.

MCCALL

I'll tell him. Where does he live.

We'll get him on the phone right

now.

DAVE

I hate fucking Springfield.

MCCALL

Is that where you're family lives?

DAVE

I still hear them, man. You can't

jam them. They've got the technology,

man. They've got the satellites,

Jack. They keep shooting beams off

those satellites. What power do I

have?

MCCALL

NOOOO!

ROPER

McCall!

ROPER

McCall!

ROPER

Where are we going?

MCCALL

Give me a twenty dollar four-six

exacta.

TELLER

The six is scratched.

MCCALL

Then give me a fucking four-seven

exacta.

MCCALL

Come on four horse! Come on Seven

horse!

MCCALL

Come on four-seven... Come on...

Come on... Come on...

ROPER

It might have happened no matter who

was up there.

MCCALL

Bullshit! Would it have happened to

you?

ROPER

Maybe... There's one thing you have

to remember... You don't create the

situations. You can only try to save

people from them.

MCCALL

I thought I could do it. I was so

damn sure of myself. But I didn't

know what to say. The words wouldn't

come. My mouth turned to mush. You

make it look so easy, Roper. But it

is not. It's not easy.

(beat)

It's a different job than looking

through the rifle scope.

ROPER

That it is.

MCCALL

How many have you lost?

ROPER

I look at it as how many I've saved.

That's the way you've got to look at

it.

MCCALL

And what about the ones you don't

save?

ROPER

You live with it... and they haunt

you. It doesn't leave.

MCCALL

And what if you can't live with it?

ROPER

You've got to decide that for

yourself.

ROPER

I've lost three. One of them was my

partner. I think about them every

time I go into a situation.

(a beat)

There's a million people in this

city with all kinds of twisted shit

going on in their heads, and the

bitch of this job is that we expect

to go out every day and do the

impossible -- to somehow control all

this craziness... and we can't.

(a beat)

Nobody's faulting you for this,

McCall. My advice is you let yourself

off the hook.

MCCALL

I don't know... I don't know...

ROPER

Let's get out of here.

HAWKINS

What the fuck... You bring me all

the way over here to tell me you've

got no collateral! What do I look

like to you -- Santa Claus? I'm a

bail bondsman!

KORDA

No, no, see what I'm sayin' is, I've

got the --

HAWKINS

Pick up a fucking phone for chrissake!

You think I got time for this crap?

KORDA

Hey, hey, I got shit on the outside.

I got somebody cashing it in for me

and --

HAWKINS

Gimme a fuckin' break.

KORDA

Alright, alright, look, man, look,

just leave me your card. I can get

it to you by tomorrow night.

ROPER

(snootily)

It has a nice "nose".

WAITER

The special this evening is braised

sweetbreads with a white truffle

sauce on cracked bulgar.

ROPER

That's my favorite.

(smiles)

Why don't you give us a minute.

ROPER

You like this place?

RONNIE

It's very nice.

ROPER

I guess you realize that there's

something special that I want to

talk to you about.

RONNIE

There is?

ROPER

For the last week things have been

going pretty well between us. I think

we've been doing a good job getting

intimate and all that stuff...

RONNIE

Yeah?

ROPER

...Let me just show you.

RONNIE

Scottie, we should think this over

before we...

ROPER

Tahiti.

RONNIE

Ohhh... A vacation... Yeah that sounds

like a great idea.

ROPER

Oh you thought I was going to ask

you...

ROPER

Oh, no-no-no-no-no... Let's go to

Tahiti first and see if that works

out...

ROPER

I assume you're having your usual --

the "air dried venison".

KORDA

Got another load.

JAIL GUARD #3

Rack 'em up.

(into the phone)

Look, man, if it doesn't make it

down here by five it's not my problem.

KORDA

All done.

CUT TO:

A VOICE (O.S.)

Hey!

KORDA

...Yeah?

JAIL GUARD #1

You dropped your card.

JAIL GUARD #1

You guys are the scum of the earth.

KORDA

Just tryin' to make a living.

JAIL GUARD #2

I don't know what to tell you, mam,

your brother ain't here. Try San

Bruno.

WOMAN

I just came from San Bruno -- they

sent me here!

JAIL GUARD #2

I'm sorry. Then I don't know where

he is.

KORDA

Listen, can I just sign outta here?

WOMAN

What do you mean, you don't know

where he is?! You can't just lose

somebody!

JAIL GUARD #2

(to Korda)

Who are you again?

KORDA

Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta

be over at county in fifteen minutes,

alright?

JAIL GUARD #2

Johnny who?

WOMAN

(to Korda)

Can you believe these people?

KORDA

It's the criminal justice system.

What can I tell ya? It's a mess.

JAIL GUARD #2

Alright, alright, just sign.

KORDA

If you find him, gimme a call.

A VOICE (O.S.)

Hey!

JAIL GUARD #2

Hold on a second here.

KORDA

Is there a problem?

JAIL GUARD #2

You signed out twice.

KORDA

I what?

JAIL GUARD #2

Look, why don't you just come on

back inside for a second.

KORDA

Wait a minute, lemme see that.

KORDA

Well, that's funny, I wonder how

that happened.

ROPER

How come in those foreign movies the

young girl is always with some fat,

old guy.

RONNIE

In Europe women find older men very

sexy.

ROPER

When I get old and fat, I'm moving

to Europe.

RONNIE

I forgot to leave food for Paco.

He's probably starving.

ROPER

Damn, my eyes are tired from reading

that movie.

RONNIE

(doggie voice)

I'm sorry, Paco. I forgot --

RONNIE

Paco?

RONNIE

Paco?

RONNIE

Paco, have you been eating my face

soap, again?

RONNIE

(very concerned)

What is it, Scottie?

ROPER

Korda escaped.

RONNIE

And you think he'll...

ROPER

Hey, I'm on edge a little. Let's

relax. I'm sure he's just going to

try to get out of town. Anyway we

leave tomorrow.

ROPER

Why don't we do some of that European

movie stuff.

RONNIE

I don't think you're old and fat

enough for me.

ROPER

Use your imagination.

MCCALL

You sure you packed everything? Maybe

you forgot your bowling ball.

RONNIE

I sent that ahead, wise guy.

ROPER (V.O.)

Why don't you come back up with me,

Ronnie.

RONNIE

I think I'll stand out here in the

sun.

ROPER

It's better if you stay inside.

RONNIE

You've got to calm down --

ROPER

Ronnie, come on baby, we gotta go.

Time to get movin'.

ROPER

(continuing)

Ronnie?

ROPER

(continuing)

Ronnie, where are you? Time to go.

ROPER

(continuing)

Ronnie.

ROPER

(continuing)

She's gone.

MCCALL

(nodding)

Scott...

ROPER

That son of a bitch. If he...

ROPER

(continuing; to himself)

He's fucking with you, Scott, be

cool... keep your head.

CUT TO:

KORDA (V.O.)

(filtered)

I got your lady, Roper.

(laughs)

KORDA (V.O.)

(continuing)

You got something that belongs to

me, and I want it back.

(beat)

Twelve-fifteen, Mare Island, North

Entrance off Dixon. Building twenty-

eight, by the dry docks.

(beat)

I so much as smell another cop, I'll

be sending you parts of this bitch

for a month.

ROPER

He's gonna kill her no matter what.

If I take him these jewels he's gonna

kill me and her.

MCCALL

So what do you want to do?

ROPER

That's a chance I gotta take.

MCCALL

Then we better get moving... But

there's no way we can get the jewels

out of evidence.

CUT TO:

FRANK

Scott, we go back a long way but you

can't expect me to do this!

ROPER

Frank, this guy is a psychopath and

he's got Ronnie. It's the only way

I'm going to get close to him.

FRANK

Then go to the Lieutenant or the

D.A. with it, for Christsakes. You're

asking me to put my fucking job on

the line!

ROPER

They'll never approve it, you know

that. Besides, I involve the

department and she's dead. I got one

chance with this guy, Frank, alone.

(beat)

He killed Sam and he'll kill her.

ROPER

(continuing)

What if it were Mary?

(beat)

You'd break every fucking rule in

the book... wouldn't you?

FRANK

I hope to God I never have to make

that decision...

FRANK

(continuing)

...and this conversation never

happened. I never saw you today. Now

I gotta go take a leak.

ROPER

I owe you one, Frank.

CUT TO:

MCCALL

Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard,

cranes, high buildings... he'll be

in place where he can see everything.

(to Roper)

How are we going to get me in there?

ROPER

Good question.

ROPER

Korda!

KORDA (O.S.)

(filtered)

Nice of you to make it, Roper. Take

your jacket off, put it on the hood.

KORDA (O.S.)

(continuing)

Now, over to the chains, to your

left.

KORDA (O.S.)

(continuing)

But first, let's have a look under

the tarp. Pull it back.

CUT TO:

KORDA (O.S.)

All right, move it.

KORDA (O.S.)

(continuing)

Throw in and your piece.

KORDA (O.S.)

And your back up.

KORDA (O.S.)

(continuing)

Walk under the cranes and down the

alleyway. At the end, turn right.

Building thirty-six.

ROPER

(to himself)

Where the hell are you, McCall?

KORDA (O.S.)

Right there, Roper.

ROPER

Shit.

KORDA (O.S.)

Come on in, there's someone just

dying to see you.

ROPER

(loudly)

Where are you?

MCCALL

Right here, Scott.

KORDA (O.S.)

Get your ass in here, Roper.

MCCALL

Stay cool, real easy...

ROPER

Where is she, Korda? I want to see

her.

KORDA

Walk to the table.

KORDA (O.S.)

(continuing)

Open your shirt.

ROPER

I'm not wearing a wire. This is just

between you and me.

KORDA (O.S.)

Shut the fuck up and do what I say!

ROPER

Satisfied?

KORDA (O.S.)

Open the bag, dump everything on the

table.

ROPER

It's all there.

KORDA (O.S.)

Spread it out.

ROPER

Only the jewels, Korda, you've got

my word.

KORDA (O.S.)

Show me something.

KORDA (O.S.)

(continuing)

Not that one.

ROPER

(continuing)

Right there, the one in front...

yeah, that one. Toss it.

KORDA (O.S.)

(continuing)

I'm impressed. I didn't think you

could do it. What did you have to

do, steal them?

ROPER

Yeah.

KORDA (O.S.)

(wry)

That's not going to look too good on

your service record.

ROPER

I'll worry about that. Let's get on

with it.

KORDA

My sentiments exactly.

MCCALL

Wait for the right moment, Scott...

KORDA

Fill it up. Just in case there's a

homing device in the other one.

KORDA

(continuing)

Now bring it over here.

MCCALL

Oh, shit...

MCCALL

(continuing)

All right, Scott, bring him out.

KORDA

That's far enough. Bag on the floor.

ROPER

I've kept my end. Ronnie first.

KORDA

Oh, shit, in all the excitement I

almost forgot. She right here...

ROPER

Be cool, Ronnie, I'm gonna get you

out of this.

KORDA

No shit, this I gotta see...

KORDA

(continuing)

Fuckin' cool, huh? I rewired the

switch. You see, you have to keep

your finger on the button or the

little lady gets cut...

KORDA

(continuing; grins)

Right in half.

MCCALL

Hold it right there...

KORDA

But then, that's not my problem.

MCCALL (O.S.)

Light's out, fucker...

MCCALL

Jesus!

KORDA

You see, it's out of my hands.

MCCALL

Roper, move...

KORDA

Well, hate to run but I've got a

plane to catch. You take good care

of the little lady, hear?

KORDA

(continuing)

How careless of me. You see, there's

only one way out of here, and you're

standing right in the way.

(grins)

You could move, but then...

KORDA

(continuing)

Sure hate to be in your shoes.

MCCALL

What the hell's going on?

ROPER

McCall, stop him, stop the car!

MCCALL

What car?

ROPER

McCall!

ROPER

McCall, shoot the son of a bitch!

KORDA

Bye, bye, cop...

RONNIE

Scottie, Scottie...

ROPER

It's all over, babe, it's all over.

ROPER

Stay here, don't move.

RONNIE

Scottie...

ROPER

Do it!

ROPER

McCall, you all right?

MCCALL

(in pain)

I'm okay. Korda... went down the

side of the building...

ROPER

Stay put.

ROPER

(shouting)

Give it up, Korda, you got away with

nothing! Nothing but a bag of shit!

It's all fake!

ROPER

(continuing)

Go on, you stupid fuck, look at it!

It's all shit! A hundred dollars

worth of glass!

KORDA

You fuck!!!

DISSOLVE TO:

RONNIE

I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti

is magnificent, Scottie.

ROPER

Yeah, I could get used to this

Paradise shit.

ROPER

(to waitress)

I'll have another Pena Colada. And

this time could you shave the ice,

please.

WAITRESS

Oui, Monsieur. Right away.

RONNIE

Scottie?

ROPER

Hmm?

RONNIE

I've been thinking.

ROPER

Hmm?

RONNIE

Things have been going pretty well

between us, haven't they?

ROPER

(sensing something's

up)

Yeah.

RONNIE

You've changed you know. I don't

think there's anything you can't do

once you put your mind to it.

RONNIE

I was just thinking...

(here it comes)

There's something special I want to

talk to you about.

(he's listening)

I think it's time we went to a whole

other phase in our relationship.

(pointedly)

A deeper level.

ROPER

(no longer relaxed,

sitting up)

A deeper level?

RONNIE

That's right. We've got to bare it

all. Here and now. 'Cause I think

I'm finally ready to go for it...

ROPER

(cutting her off at

the pass)

Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold

on. I know it's beautiful here. The

sun, the sand, the sea and all that

nature shit can really get to you.

But we've got to keep our perspective

here. This place isn't real. This

isn't reality.

RONNIE

Scott...

ROPER

I mean I said this trip should be a

'roadtest'.

RONNIE

...the hell are you talking about?

ROPER

I'm talking about... What are you

talking about?

RONNIE

I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping

down on this beach and gettin' you

know... 'naked in Tahiti'.

ROPER

You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'

(off her look)

Shit, I thought you were talkin'

bout, you know... the "M" word.

RONNIE

You thought I was talking about

getting married?!

RONNIE

I'm talking about taking our clothes

off, silly. You said you would.

ROPER

You crazy? With all those people

around?

RONNIE

Know what you are?! You're a prude,

Roper.

ROPER

The hell I am!

RONNIE

(amused)

Prude.

ROPER

First you want me to put on one of

those skinny ass bathing suits --

tongs or thongs or whatever you call

them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped

around a piece of dental floss... No

way.

FADE OUT:

THE END
