Who's this guy to say Jackie's

lonely? He doesn't wear it on his

sleeve. Man's got one helluva game

face. Take no prisoners. How does

some reporter know how he feels.

They stop talking as Robinson walks past, the last one into

the shower, a couple of towels around him.

Nothing. It's just, sometimes when

those loudmouths in the stands, I

know you can hear them.

Don't worry. It's okay.

No, it's not okay. And I can hear

them, too.

Jack looks at her, takes her hand in his.

I know. I'm sorry for that.

Rachel squeezes his hand back.

We're the Dodgers. We have a

Your team's not welcome, not while

You mean Robinson can't stay here?

I mean the entire team is refused!

We've been staying here ten years.
