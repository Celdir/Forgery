AIBILEEN

I was...born in 1911...on Piedmont

Plantation in Cherokee County.

WOMAN (O.C.)

Did you know as a girl, growing up,

that one day you'd be a maid?

AIBILEEN

Yes, ma'am. I did.

WOMAN (O.C.)

And you knew that because?

AIBILEEN

Momma was a maid. My grandmother

was a house slave.

WOMAN (0.C.)

Oh.

WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)

A...House...Slave. Uh-huh. Okay.

WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)

Now, did you ever dream of being

something else?

WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)

Well then, what's it feel like, to

raise a white child when your own

child's at home...being looked

after by somebody else?

2.

FADE TO BLACK:

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

I done raised seventeen kids in my

life. Lookin' after white babies,

that's what I do.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

I know how to get them babies

asleep, stop cryin' and go in the

toilet bowl before they mommas even

get outta bed in the mornin.'

AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Babies like fat. They like big fat

legs too. That I know.

AIBILEEN (V.O) (CONT'D)

I work from eight to four, six days

a week. Ninety-five cents an hour

comes to a hundred seventy-two

dollars ever month. I do all the

cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing

and grocery shopping, but mostly, I

take care a baby girl...And law, I

worry she gone be fat. Ain't gonna

be no beauty queen either.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

You is kind. You is smart. You is

important.

ELIZABETH

Aibileen, bridge club's in an hour!

Did you finish the chicken salad?

3.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs. No

paprika!

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

Does this dress look homemade?

AIBILEEN

I reckon when you finish, it won't.

AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Miss Leefolt still don't pick Baby

Girl up but once a day. The

birthin' blues had got holt a Miss

Leefolt pretty hard. I done seen it

happen plenty a times...once babies

start havin' they own babies. And

the young white ladies of

Jackson...Oh, law, they was havin'

some babies.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

But, not Miss Skeeter...

AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

No babies...No man...And not

lookin'.

MR. BLACKLY

Shut the Goddamn door!

MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)

They announced last week

cigarettes'll kill you.

4.

MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)

(CHEWING)

Okay, let's see what you got.

MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)

"Murrah High Editor, Ole Miss Rebel

Rouser Editor, double major, Junior

League editor...Damn girl, didn't

you have any fun?

SKEETER

Is that...important?

MR. BLACKLY

You got any references?

MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)

That...is a rejection letter.

SKEETER

Not exactly. Missus Stein-

MR. BLACKLY

-STEIN?! Missus who?

SKEETER

Elaine Stein, Senior Editor at

Harper and Row Publishing. In New

York. I'm going to be a serious

writer, Mr. Blackly. So, when I

applied to Harper and Row, Missus

STEIN WROTE-

MR. BLACKLY

-She told you "no."

SKEETER

Until I gain some experience, Mr.

Blackly! See, it says it right

there at the end. "Great

potential...Gain some experience

and please apply again."

5.

MR. BLACKLY

Oh, Christ...I guess you'll do.

Can you clean?

SKEETER

Clean?

MR. BLACKLY

Clean!

MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)

Miss Myrna's gone shit-house crazy

on us, drunk hair spray or

something. Read her past columns

and all these letters. Answer them

just like she did, nobody'll know

the damn difference.

MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)

You know who Miss Myrna is?

SKEETER

(COVERING)

I read her articles all the time.

MR. BLACKLY

Articles? Ha! It's a cleaning

advice column, Miss Phelan. Eight

bucks a week. Copy due Thursday.

HILLY

(SCREAMING UPWARD)

Momma! We're late for bridge!

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Miss Hilly was the first of the

babies to have a baby. And it must

a come out of her like the eleventh

commandment. `Cause once Miss

Hilly had a baby, ever girl at the

bridge table wanted one too.

6.

HILLY

Minny! Go get Momma!

MINNY

Missus Walters?! You need help

coming down?

MISSUS WALTERS

I'm down!

MISSUS WALTERS (CONT'D)

Been down.

MINNY

Gone give me a heart attack!

MISSUS WALTERS

Minny, I'm getting my coat.

MINNY

It's ninety degrees out there,

Missus Walters.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Once Missus Walters' arteries went

hard, Miss Hilly moved her and

Minny in with her. Fired the maid

she had just to make room. See,

Minny about the best cook in

Mississippi, and Miss Hilly wanted

her.

7.

HILLY

Minny, William took Billy out for

ice cream. So, hurry back and get

Billy down for his nap. No dilly

dallying.

MINNY

Yes, ma'am.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Minny my best friend. A old lady

like me lucky to have her.

MAE MOBLEY

No!

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

It's a tricky thing...you try to

make a baby go in the toilet bowl

before it's time. If theys can't

get the hang of it, theys get to

thinking low a theyselves.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

You drunk up two glasses a grape

juice, I know you got to tee-tee.

MAE MOBLEY

Nooo.

AIBILEEN

I give you a cookie if you go.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

Mae Mobley! You going!

8.

ELIZABETH

Aibileen, the girls are pulling up,

and the table isn't set!

MAE MOBLEY

Mae Mobley go, Momma!

ELIZABETH

Get in your room! Right now!

MAE MOBLEY

I sorry.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

I lost my own boy, Treelore, right

before I started waitin' on the

Leefolts...

CLOSE ON:

AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

After Treelore died, a bitter seed

was planted inside a me. And I

just didn't feel so accepting

anymore.

HILLY

Hey, girls!

9.

YOUNG WOMEN

(IN UNISON)

Hey, Hilly!

HILLY

(over her shoulder)

Put Momma in a chair before she

breaks a hip.

MISSUS WALTERS

I'm not deaf yet, Hilly.

HILLY

Aibileen, I want you to have this

coat. It's too big for Momma now

and it's way too expensive to put

in the coat drive.

HILLY (CONT'D)

All yours.

AIBILEEN

Thank you, Miss Hilly.

HILLY

Go on. Try it on.

AIBILEEN

Hold on! Those are Miss Hilly's.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

Gots to have paprika on `em.

MINNY

Forgive me, Lord, but I'm gonna

have to kill that woman.

10.

AIBILEEN

Watch yo mouth, Minny.

MINNY

Looks like a walking Christmas

present with all them bows.

MINNY (CONT'D)

And, now she gone to puttin' pencil

marks on the toilet paper.

AIBILEEN

Oh, law! Did she?

MINNY

Uh-hum. But, I carry paper in from

my own damn house. That fool don't

know.

SKEETER

Hey, girls.

GIRLS

(IN UNISON)

Hey, Skeeter.

JOLENE

Well, if it isn't Long-Haul-

Skeeter. We didn't think you'd

ever leave Ole Miss.

SKEETER

Well, it's supposed to take four

years, Jolene.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Sorry I'm late. I had to stop by

the cleaners and pick up my black

dress.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

What?

11.

HILLY

About supper club tonight...Honey,

Stuart had to cancel.

SKEETER

Again?

HILLY

He can't get off the rig, Skeeter.

It's offshore! Stuart is a very

successful oil man.

SKEETER

I'm starting to think this Stuart

is a figment of your imagination.

ELIZABETH

Raleigh called his cousin down in

Hattiesburg. He'll drive up.

SKEETER

The cousin with one eye?!

SKEETER (CONT'D)

I guess his black patch will match

my dress. Just forget it.

HILLY

One eye?!

SKEETER

I got a job today... at The Jackson

Journal!

HILLY

They'd be a fool not to hire you.

JOLENE

To Skeeter...and her job. Last

stop `til marriage.

12.

SKEETER

The Miss Myrna column. Have y'all

read it?

HILLY

Well, no! But, I bet the poor

girls without any help, in South

Jackson, read it like the King

James.

SKEETER

Elizabeth, would you mind if I talk

to Aibileen? To help me answer

some of the letters? Just until I

get a knack for it.

ELIZABETH

Aibileen? My Aibileen? What can't

you just get Constantine to help

you?

SKEETER

Constantine...quit us.

ELIZABETH HILLY

HILLY

I'm so sorry, Skeeter.

SKEETER

I really don't want to talk about

it. Okay?

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Anyway...I don't know how to answer

these letters.

ELIZABETH

Well...I mean as long as it doesn't

interfere with her work.

13.

AIBILEEN

Leefolt residence.

CLOSE ON:

CELIA FOOTE (O.C.)

Ah-hem. Hello, is Elizabeth in?

AIBILEEN

She having bridge club right now.

May I take a message?

CELIA

Please tell her Celia Foote called

again. I'll call back tomorrow.

AIBILEEN

Yes, ma'am.

CELIA

Ah-hem. Miss?

CELIA (CONT'D)

I'm looking for some help at my

house. You know any maids looking?

AIBILEEN

No, ma'am.

CELIA FOOTE

Okay. Celia Foote. Emerson 6-8-4.

Bye, now.

14.

ELIZABETH

Who was that on the phone?

AIBILEEN

Miss Celia Foote called again.

ELIZABETH

I've never called her back, Hilly.

HILLY

She can't take a hint, can she?

JOLENE

Who's Celia Foote?

HILLY

That tacky girl Johnny married.

ELIZABETH

Girl? I heard she's twenty-eight.

JOLENE

Oh my God!

HILLY

Uh-hmm, worked concessions at a LSU

game and sold him a hotdog. And,

boy, he got a whole lot more.

SKEETER

Could have been you, Hilly.

HILLY

And live thirty minutes outside of

town? Anyway, I ran into her at

the beauty parlor, and she had the

nerve to ask if she could help with

the children's benefit.

SKEETER

Aren't we taking non-members? The

benefit's gotten so big.

HILLY

Yes, but we're not telling her.

SKEETER

Thank you, Aibileen.

ELIZABETH

Oh, Hilly, I wish you'd just go use

the bathroom.

15.

HILLY

Ah-hem. I'm fine.

MISSUS WALTERS

She's upset cause the nigra uses

the guest bath, and so do we.

ELIZABETH

Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

Just go use mine and Raleigh's.

HILLY

If Aibileen uses the guest

bathroom, I'm sure she uses yours

too.

ELIZABETH

SHE DOES NOT!

HILLY

Wouldn't you rather them take their

business outside?

SKEETER

Did y'all see the cover of "Life"

this week? Jackie's never looked

MORE REGAL-

HILLY

-Tell Raleigh every penny he spends

on a colored's bathroom, he'll get

back in spades when y'all sell.

It's just plain dangerous.

Everybody knows they carry

different diseases than we do. I

double.

ELIZABETH

I can't ask Raleigh until tax

season. But, it would be nice.

HILLY

That's why I've drafted The Home

Help Sanitation Initiative.

16.

SKEETER

"The Home"...the what?!

HILLY

As a disease preventative bill that

requires every white home to have a

separate bathroom for the colored

help. I've even notified the

Surgeon General of Mississippi.

I'll pass.

SKEETER

Maybe we ought to just build you a

bathroom outside, Hilly.

HILLY

You ought not to joke about the

colored situation.

HILLY (CONT'D)

I'll do whatever it takes to

protect our town. Your lead,

Jolene.

JOLENE

I have to skedaddle! Gotta get

over to the station!

(EXCITEDLY)

Daddy's letting me do the weather

tonight!

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Now, Miss Celia had her a man.

`Bout the best lookin' man in all

of Mississippi. But, no baby and

no friends.

17.

JOHNNY

Roses look like weeds next to you.

CELIA

Johnny, you scared the daylights

out of me!

CELIA (CONT'D)

You're home early.

CELIA (CONT'D)

Johnny, I can't get any of your old

friends from school to call me

back.

JOHNNY

Oh, who cares, honey. We got all

we need right here.

CELIA

Johnny, honestly!

JOHNNY

Doctor's orders.

CELIA

I don't know what's taking us so

long. I'm sorry.

JOHNNY

Hey, we've never done it in the

yard. Maybe that's the trick.

CELIA

Watch my hair.

18.

SKEETER

Aibileen?

AIBILEEN

Yes, ma'am.

SKEETER

I had hoped to ask you myself if

you could help me with the "Miss

Myrna" letters...

AIBILEEN

Yes, ma'am.

SKEETER

So...Would you help me?

AIBILEEN

Miss Myrna gets it wrong lotta

times. Be good to get it right.

SKEETER

Thank you, Aibileen. I plan on

splitting the pay with you, too.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Listen...all that talk in there

today. Hilly's talk I mean...I'm

sorry you had to hear that.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Is that Preacher Green's sermon on

the radio?

AIBILEEN

Yes, ma'am, it is.

SKEETER

That reminds me so much of my maid

growing up.

AIBILEEN

Constantine and me...were in church

circle together.

19.

SKEETER

She loved me like you love Mae

Mobley.

AIBILEEN

Yes, ma'am.

SKEETER

Aibileen? How could she just quit

like that?

AIBILEEN

Quit?

SKEETER

Yes. When I got home from school

last week, Momma said she had quit.

Back in March to go live with her

people up in Chicago. She didn't

leave me a note or anything.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Could you do that to Mae Mobley?

AIBILEEN

No, ma'am. I couldn't...

SKEETER

Do you have an address for her or

anything?

ELIZABETH

I'm sorry. Did I interrupt

something?

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

Hilly wants this put in the League

newsletter.

20.

SKEETER

Aibileen, I'll drop by at ten

tomorrow to get started on Miss

Myrna.

ELIZABETH

Tomorrow is silver polishing day,

so y'all make it quick, okay?

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

I knew I had said too much to Miss

Skeeter, but Constantine's story

weren't mine to tell. Some things

a girl shouldn't have to know about

her own mother.

21.

SKEETER

Hey, Jameso.

JAMESO

Hello, Miss Eugenia.

SKEETER

Momma!

SKEETER

Momma?

CHARLOTTE

Is this a little too young?

SKEETER

It's a little too everything.

22.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Much better.

CHARLOTTE

Your daddy bought me this dress in

`58.

SKEETER

Mom, I want to ask you about

CONSTANTINE-

CHARLOTTE

-Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar

Bowl.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

Come on, you try it on.

SKEETER

What really happened?

CHARLOTTE

I told you...she went to live with

her people in Chicago...Now,

Skeeter, your mother is dying, and

she wants to see you in this dress.

SKEETER

How could she just take off without

telling me?

CHARLOTTE

I told her not to write you. I

didn't want you upset in the middle

of final exams. Honey, we were

just a job to her. With them it's

all about money...Did I tell you

Fanny Peatrow got engaged? After

she got that teller job, her mother

said she was just swimming in

proposals.

SKEETER

Good for "Fat Fanny Peatrow."

23.

CHARLOTTE

This looks precious on you! Four

years ago my daughter went off to

college, and what did she come home

with?

SKEETER CHARLOTTE

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

Hilly and Elizabeth have such

lovely children.

SKEETER

They dropped out of college to

become housewives, Mother.

CHARLOTTE

If only you'd show a little

gumption, Eugenia...

SKEETER

Well, I did get a job today.

CHARLOTTE

You did?

SKEETER

Writing...for The Jackson Journal.

CHARLOTTE

Great. You can write my obituary.

"Charlotte Phelan dead. Her

daughter still single."

SKEETER

Momma, would it really be so

terrible if I never met a husband?

CHARLOTTE

I need to...ask you something,

Skeeter. I read the other day

about how some girls...get

unbalanced, start thinking

these...well, unnatural thoughts.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

Are you...do you...find men

attractive? Are you having

unnatural thoughts about...

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

Girls or...or women?

24.

SKEETER

Oh my God!

CHARLOTTE

Because, this article says there's

a cure, a special root tea.

SKEETER

Mother, I want to be with girls as

much as you wanna be with Jameso.

CHARLOTTE

Eugenia!

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

(SHOUTING)

Carlton's bringing Rebecca to

dinner. Try to look presentable!

CARLTON

What the hell do you know about

cleaning a house, Skeeter?

SKEETER

It's a start, Carlton.

CARLTON

(MOCKINGLY)

I thought you wanted to write

books.

ROBERT

Leave your sister alone, Son. I'm

proud of you, Sweetheart.

25.

CHARLOTTE

Oh, the irony of it all. Givin'

advice on how to keep up a home

when she...

SKEETER

Oh! No, Pascagolua! You couldn't

have known this...But, see, I'm

allergic to almonds.

PASCAGOLUA

Sorry, Miss Eugenia.

SKEETER

Last time I had an almond, I

stopped liking men.

REBECCA

Oh my Lord.

SKEETER

It's okay, Rebecca. They have a

special root tea now.

CHARLOTTE

You have pushed it, Young Lady!

SKEETER

Daddy, what happened to

Constantine?

ROBERT

Ah...well, Constantine went to live

with her family. People move on,

Skeeter. But I do wish she'd

stayed down here with us.

SKEETER

I don't believe you.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Mother, did you...fire her?

CHARLOTTE

You wouldn't understand. Not until

you've hired help of your own.

26.

SKEETER

She raised me!

CHARLOTTE

SHE DID NOT!

SKEETER

She worked here for twenty-nine

years.

CHARLOTTE

It was a colored thing, and I've

put it behind me.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

Excuse me, Rebecca. My daughter

has upset my cancerous ulcers.

SKEETER

Good luck down there, Carlton.

CARLTON

Have fun at the dance, Skeeter

Legs.

CHARLOTTE

Eugenia! You've grown another inch

since breakfast. Go put on a dress

that fits before that boy and his

daddy come pick you up.

27.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

Pray Carlton doesn't like LSU,

Constantine. It's so far. It

might be the last we see of him.

CONSTANTINE

Gone be just you and me all

weekend.

SKEETER

I just couldn't tell her I didn't

get asked to the dance.

CONSTANTINE

Some things we should just keep to

ourselves.

SKEETER

I'm already taller than the boys'

basketball coach. How tall are

you, Constantine?

CONSTANTINE

I'm five-thirteen, so quit feeling

sorry for yourself.

SKEETER

Momma was third runner up in the

Miss South Carolina pageant.

CONSTANTINE

"Miss" what? Shoot, Child! You

gone be "Miss Something Better."

CONSTANTINE (CONT'D)

Now you listen. Your momma didn't

pick her life. It pick her, and she

done even know it. You gone do

something big with yours. Bigger

than your momma or your brother.

28.

SKEETER

What about you? What did you want

to be, Constantine?

CONSTANTINE

Oh, Child! We don't get to pick.

This pick us, and that just how it

is.

JOLENE

Sunny skies and a high of ninety-

eight today with ninety-nine

percent humidity. There's a slight

chance of afternoon showers so

y'all carry an umbrella.

MISS STEIN

What gave you this idea, Miss

Phelan? I'm...curious.

29.

SKEETER

I was...well, I was raised by a

colored woman. I've seen how

simple it can be and...well, how

complex it can be, too...between

the families and the help.

MISS STEIN

Continue.

SKEETER

I'd like to write something from

the point of view of the help.

These colored women raise white

children, and then twenty years

later those children become the

employer. It's that irony, Miss

Stein, that we love them and they

love us yet...we don't even let

them use the toilet in the house.

MISS STEIN

I'm listening.

SKEETER

Margaret Mitchell glorified the

mammy figure who dedicates her

whole life to a white family but no

one...ever asked Mammy how she felt

about it. There is both undisguised

hate for white women and an

inexplicable love, but nobody ever

talks about it down here.

MISS STEIN

So, a side to this never before

heard.

SKEETER

Yes!

CHARLOTTE (O.C.)

Skeeter, who are you talking to in

there?

SKEETER

Go! Away!

SKEETER (CONT'D)

So, yes, their side of the story.

30.

MISS STEIN

Who was that?

SKEETER

My mother. She just dropped by to-

MISS STEIN

Look, no maid in her right mind

would ever tell you the truth.

That's a hell of a risk in a place

like Jackson, Mississippi. I

watched them try to integrate your

bus station on the news. Oy! They

jammed fifty-five Negroes in a jail

built for four.

SKEETER

I already have a maid.

MISS STEIN

Really? A negro maid has already

agreed to talk to you?

SKEETER

Yes, ma'am...

MISS STEIN

Well...I suppose I could read what

you come up with. The book biz

could use a little rattling.

SKEETER

You'd do that?

MISS STEIN

I'm saying I'll let you know if

it's even worth pursuing.

SKEETER

Oh, thank you, Miss Stein!

MISS STEIN

And for God's sake, you're a twenty-

four-year-old educated woman. Go

get an apartment.

31.

SKEETER

"Dear Miss Myrna, How do I remove

the rings from my fat, slovenly

husband's shirt collar when he is

such a pig and sweats like one

too..."

AIBILEEN

Which one she want a get rid of?

Them rings or the husband?

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

Tell her a vinegar and Pine-Sol

soak. Then let it set in the sun a

bit.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

Bout an hour. Let it dry.

HILLY

Build it just like the one at my

house, right against the garage.

HILLY (CONT'D)

Oh, mercy!

SKEETER

Aibileen, do you ever wish you

could...change things?

SKEETER (CONT'D)

I mean, all that talk yesterday and

now with what Hilly's up to.

32.

AIBILEEN

Everthing's fine.

SKEETER

My momma fired Constantine. Thank

you for telling me that.

AIBILEEN

I never tolt you that!

SKEETER

Aibileen, I have an

idea...Something I want to write

about...But I need your help.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

I want to interview you...about

what it is like to work as a maid.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

I'd like to do a book of interviews

about working for white families.

Show what it's like to work for,

say...Elizabeth.

AIBILEEN

You know what'd happen to me if

Miss Leefolt knew I was tellin'

stories on her?

SKEETER

I was thinking we wouldn't tell

her. The other maids will have to

keep it secret, too.

AIBILEEN

Other maids?

SKEETER

I was hoping to get four or five.

To really show what it's like in

Jackson. To see what y'all get

paid, the babies, the bathrooms,

the good and the bad.

AIBILEEN

They set my cousin Shinelle's car

on fire just cause she went down to

the voting station.

33.

SKEETER

A book has never been written like

this, Aibileen.

AIBILEEN

`Cause they's a reason. I do this

with you, I might as well burn my

own house down.

RALEIGH

I put up with the new clothes and

all the damn trips to New Orleans,

but this takes the goddamn cake!

ELIZABETH

It'll confuse Mae Mobley if she

sees Aibileen going inside. And we

can't risk her health.

KITCHEN:

LIVING ROOM:

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

Hilly spoke to the Surgeon General!

She also said it'll add value to

our home!

RALEIGH

Great! Mae Mobley can just go to

college in that bathroom, too.

ELIZABETH

Honey, Hilly's covering the

cost...and said you can just do

William's taxes to pay her back.

RALEIGH

We don't take orders from the

Holbrooks!

RALEIGH

Skeeter? How you doing?

SKEETER

Fine.

34.

RALEIGH

Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen.

ELIZABETH

Aibileen, Mae Mobley's crying her

eyes out!

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

Skeeter...Hello. I'm sorry but I

think it's best if you leave now.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

And...I don't think this Miss Myrna

thing is gonna work out with

Aibileen.

MISSUS WALTERS

You're making it a lot hotter

flapping your arm like that.

HILLY

That should do it. Minny, go get

me and Momma some iced tea.

MINNY

Uh...Miss Hilly?

HILLY

Yes.

MINNY

Never mind.

35.

MISSUS WALTERS

You go on ahead and use the guest

bath, Minny. It's okay.

HILLY

Oh, for crying out loud. It's just

a little rain. She can go get an

umbrella up in William's Study!

MISSUS WALTERS

I believe she was working for me

before you dragged us both here.

MINNY

I'm gone get your tea.

HILLY (O.C.)

Minny?

HILLY

MINNYYYY, are you in there?

MINNY

Yes, ma'am...

HILLY

Are you sitting down?

HILLY (CONT'D)

GET OFF OF MY TOILET!!!

36.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

On top a Minny losin' her tenth

job, eighteen people died in

Jackson that day. Ten white.

Eight black.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

God don't pay no mind to color or

class once he sets a tornado loose.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Soon after, that bitter seed inside

of me had sprout and was growing

fast...

ELIZABETH

Hurry, Aibileen. Mae Mobley's up,

and I'm off to the doctor.

37.

MAE MOBLEY

Aibee bafroom, Momma!

MAE MOBLEY (CONT'D)

Aibee?

ELIZABETH

No!

AIBILEEN

Be right there, Baby Girl.

SKEETER

Afternoon, Aibileen.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Can I talk to you?

AIBILEEN

You got some "Miss Myrna" questions

for me?

SKEETER

No.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Please.

AIBILEEN

Yes, ma'am.

38.

SKEETER

Please let me interview you. I

know it's scary, but I really

believe this has to be done. We'll

be careful.

AIBILEEN

This already ain't careful, Miss

Skeeter. You not knowing that is

what scares me most. I'm sorry.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

I know pretty well what happens if

the white ladies found out we was

writing about them. Womens, they

ain't like men. Women don`t beat

you with a stick. Naw, they like

to keep they hands clean. Got a

shiny set a tools they use, sharp

as witches' fingernails.

"Compilation of Jim Crow Laws of the South"

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Any person printing, publishing or

circulating written matter urging

for public acceptance of social

equality between whites and negroes

is subject to imprisonment.

39.

MINNY

Oh, Aibileen! I went and did it

now!

MINNY (CONT'D)

Miss Hilly been tellin' everbody in

town I stole a candelabra! That's

why I can't get no job.

AIBILEEN

Everbody know you honest, Minny.

MINNY

Oh, but I got her back...I did

something awful, Aibileen.

AIBILEEN

What you did?!

MINNY (O.S.)

I cain't tell! I ain't tellin'

nobody! I done a terrible awful

thing to that woman. And now she

knows what I did!

MINNY

She got what she deserve, Aibileen.

But, now I ain't gone never get no

work again...Leroy gone kill me.

40.

AIBILEEN

Minny!

SKEETER

I parked way up on State Street and

caught a cab here like you asked.

AIBILEEN

Got dropped two streets over?

SKEETER

Aibileen, I now know it's against

the law for us to meet like this.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

I've never seen you out of uniform

before. You look nice, Aibileen.

AIBILEEN

Thank you.

41.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. I've never had a white

person in my house before.

SKEETER

I've never been in a colored

person's home before. I think

we're both doing great. This tea

is really nice.

AIBILEEN

Miss Skeeter, What if...What if you

don't like what I got to say?

About white peoples?

SKEETER

I...this isn't about my opinion.

It doesn't matter how I feel.

AIBILEEN

You gone have to change my name.

Mine, Miss Leefolt's, everbody's.

SKEETER

Everybody? So, you know other

maids who might be interested?

AIBILEEN

It gone be hard.

SKEETER

What about Minny?

AIBILEEN

Minny got her some stories, sho

nuff. But, she ain't real keen on

talking to white peoples right now.

SKEETER

What does it feel like, to raise a

white child when your own child's

at home, being...looked after by

somebody else?

AIBILEEN

It feel...Uh.

SKEETER

Is that your son?

42.

AIBILEEN

Yes, ma'am. He dead two years now.

Got run over at the lumber yard.

Lungs were crushed.

SKEETER

I'm so sorry. That's horrible.

And, Aibileen, you don't have to

call me "ma'am." Not here anyway.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Do you want to talk about the

bathroom? Or, about Elizab--Miss

Leefolt? Anything about the way

she pays you? Has she ever yelled

at you in front of Mae Mobley?

AIBILEEN

I'm sorry, I-

SKEETER

No, I am.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Let's just do a couple of Miss

Myrna letters, and I'll run on...

AIBILEEN

I thought I might write my stories

down and read them to you.

SKEETER

Well, sure I guess.

AIBILEEN

It no different than writing down

my prayers.

SKEETER

You don't say your prayers aloud?

AIBILEEN

Prayer like electricity. It keep

life going. Writing it down make

it more powerful. Lot a ailing,

sick peoples in this town.

SKEETER

I'm sure.

AIBILEEN

I didn't get a chance to pray for

Treelore.

43.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

God took him fast `cause he didn't

want to argue with me. He was just

twenty-four years old. The best

part of a person's life.

SKEETER

Oh, Aibileen.

AIBILEEN

But he'd like we's doing this. He

always said we gone have a writer

in the family one day...After my

prayers last night, I got some

stories down too.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

My first white baby to ever look

after was named Alton Carrington

Speers. It was 1938, and I'd just

turned fourteen years old. Daddy

had left us, so I dropped out a

school to help momma with the

bills.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Alton's momma died a lung disease.

I loved that baby, and he loved me.

That's when I learned I could make

children feel proud of theyselves.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Alton used to always be asking me

how come I's black...

AIBILEEN

It just ate him up, so one time I

told him it cause I drank too much

coffee. Oh, law, you should a seen

his face.

44.

SKEETER

This is great. You have no idea

how much I appreciate this...But I

just have to ask. What changed

your mind?

AIBILEEN

(WITHOUT PAUSE)

Miss Hilly Holbrook.

HILLY

We're running behind on our "coat

drive," girls. So hurry up and

clean out those closets...But our

Christmas Benefit, however, is

right on schedule as y'all have

already filled all our baked goods

raffle slots.

HILLY (CONT'D)

Y'all think we can put a dent in

the African Children's hunger this

year?

HILLY (CONT'D)

Now for some exciting news...I

wanted y'all to be the first to

know...My William is seeking

election to the State Senate this

November!

HILLY (CONT'D)

He's runnin' on a platform of

health. Protecting our children.

Protecting our way of life. So, I,

with William, have drafted The Home

Health Sanitation Initiative.

45.

HILLY (CONT'D)

Skeeter, when can we expect to see

the initiative in the newsletter?

I gave it to you a month ago.

ELIZABETH

I gave that to you myself!

SKEETER

I, ah...Well, I-

HILLY

Would you please stand, Skeeter?

SKEETER

I'll have it in there soon.

SKEETER

Hilly? Do you need a ride?

SKEETER (CONT'D)

I'm sorry about the newsletter.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

With Momma being sick and-

HILLY

He's coming! Oh, Skeeter, he's

definitely coming this time. This

Saturday night.

SKEETER

Oh, Hilly, he's cancelled twice

before. Maybe it's a sign.

HILLY

Don't you dare say that!

SKEETER

You know I won't be his type.

46.

HILLY

It's your time, Skeeter. And

damnit, I'm not going to let you

miss this just because your mother

convinced you you're not good

enough for somebody like him.

MINNY

Eat up, Girl. Miss Woodra's like

to not feed ya on try-out day.

MINNY (CONT'D)

I still say you're too young to be

waitin' on white peoples...Now,

Sugar, I want you to listen to me,

and you listen to me good.

MINNY (CONT'D)

These are the rules for working in

a white lady's house.

MINNY (CONT'D)

Rule Number One: Don't you ever let

White Lady find you sittin' on her

toilet.

MINNY (CONT'D)

Number Two: You keep your nose out

of White Lady's problems, and don't

cry to her with yours. White

people ain't your friends.

MINNY (V.O.)

Number Three: When you're cooking

white food, taste it with a

different spoon. They see you put

the tasting spoon back in the pot,

might as well throw it all out.

Spoon, too.

47.

MINNY (V.O.)

Four: You use the same cup, same

fork, same plate every day.

MINNY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Five: Don't hit her kids. White

people do they own spanking.

MINNY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Six: No sass-mouthing!

MINNY (CONT'D)

(TO HERSELF)

Number six, Minny. Number six.

CELIA

Hey there! I'm Celia Rae Foote.

Aibileen said you'd be on time.

CELIA (CONT'D)

Can I get you a cold Coca-Cola?

MINNY

No, thank you. I'm Minny

Jackson... You...cooking

something?

CELIA

One of those upsidedown cakes from

the magazine. It ain't workin' out

too good. Come on in.

MINNY

What in the hell-

MINNY (CONT'D)

(TO HERSELF)

Tuck it in, Minny. Tuck it in.

48.

CELIA

I guess I have some learnin' to do.

MINNY

(STUPID SMILE)

You sure do.

CELIA

Johnny's momma wouldn't let me

decorate a thing. If I had my way,

this house would have wall to wall

white carpet with gold trim and

none of this old stuff.

MINNY

Where you from?

CELIA

Sugar Ditch. It's near Memphis.

MINNY

I know Sugar Ditch. My cousin live

there.

CELIA

Let's go meet Oscar!

CELIA

Johnny's granddaddy shot him up in

Montana back in 1910 with Teddy

Roosevelt.

CELIA (CONT'D)

We got five bedrooms and bathrooms

here in the main house. The pool

house has two more beds and baths.

49.

MINNY

When you gone have some chillins,

start fillin' up all these beds?

CELIA

I'm pregnant now.

MINNY

Gone be eatin' for two. Double the

cookin'.

CELIA

I know it's an awful lot to do.

Five other maids have already

turned me down...Can I at least

give you some bus money?

MINNY

When you hear me say I don't wanna

clean this house?

CELIA

What? So...You'll do it?!

MINNY

No huggin', now. No huggin'.

CELIA

I'm sorry. This is my first time

hiring a maid.

MINNY

We got to talk about some things

first. I work Sunday through

Friday.

CELIA

You can't come at all on weekends.

MINNY

Okay. What time you want me here?

CELIA

After eight, and you have to leave

at four.

MINNY

Okay. Now what your husband say

you can pay?

50.

CELIA

Johnny doesn't know I'm bringing in

help.

MINNY

And what's Mr. Johnny gone do if he

comes home and finds a colored

woman up in his kitchen?

CELIA

It's not that I'd be fibbing. I

just want him to think I can do

this on my own...I need some help

`til I get the hang of it. I need

a maid.

MINNY

A course you do. Last one done got

shot in the head.

MINNY (CONT'D)

Miss Celia, I think you done burned

up yo cake.

CELIA

Oww! Dawgonit!

MINNY

You can't use no wet towel on a hot

pan.

MINNY (CONT'D)

I'll take this burnt up cake with

me so Mister Johnny don't see it.

ELIZABETH

I'm off, Aibileen. Don't forget

Raleigh wants pot roast tonight.

51.

AIBILEEN

Yes, ma'am.

AIBILEEN

I reckon I'm ready...to talk about

Miss Leefolt now.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

Baby girl don't get her diaper

changed `til I get there in the

morning. That's `bout ten hours

she gots to sit in her mess. I be

so worried about her on my day off.

I always come in an hour early on

Mondays.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Miss Leefolt pregnant again, too.

And, law, I pray this child turn

out good. It a lonely road if a

momma don't think theys child is

pretty.

CHARLOTTE

Where are you going, Skeeter?

SKEETER

Bible study.

CHARLOTTE

On a Saturday night?

SKEETER

Momma, God doesn't care what day of

the week it is.

52.

AIBILEEN

Miss Leefolt be spending so much

time keeping up with the society

ladies, she done forgot the child

she got now.

MINNY

Aibileen!

MINNY (CONT'D)

Yule May told me what y'all up to.

MINNY (CONT'D)

Medgar Evers live five minutes

away. They blew up his carport

last night. For talking!

MINNY (CONT'D)

What makes you think colored people

need your help? You white. Why

you care?

AIBILEEN

We all working for the same thing.

MINNY

(TO SKEETER)

Maybe you just want to get her in

trouble.

SKEETER

I want to show her perspective...so

people might understand what it's

like from your side.

MINNY

Well it's a real Fourth of July

picnic.

53.

MINNY (CONT'D)

It's what we dream a doing all

weekend long, get back in they

house to polish the silver. And we

just love not getting minimum wage

or Social Security.

SKEETER

I know, Minny. Maybe things might

CHANGE IF-

MINNY

What law's gonna say you gotta be

nice to your maid? And another

thing, I don't want my children

going to school with white kids.

And I don't care a thing about

votin.' Only thing black mens get

elected to is Deacon of the church.

AIBILEEN

You don't have to do this, Minny.

MINNY

You damn right I don't! You two

givin' me the heart palpitations.

AIBILEEN

And that was a good mood.

MINNY

All right...I'm gone do it. I just

want to make sure you know this

ain't no game we're playing here.

MINNY (CONT'D)

(TO SKEETER)

Slide your chair out from under

that table and face me. I want to

see you square on at all times.

MINNY (CONT'D)

I's got to come up with your

questions, too?!

SKEETER

Let's begin...begin with...with

where you were born.

54.

MINNY

Belzoni, Mississippi on my great-

auntie's sofa. Next!

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Once Minny got to talking `bout

food, she liked to never stop...

MINNY

I put the green beans in first,

then I go on and get the pork chops

going cause, mmm-mmm, I like my

chops hot out the pan.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

But when she got to talking about

the white ladies, it took all

night...

MINNY

"Oh, Minny, I'm gone give you a

week paid vacation." Now, I ain't

had no paid vacation in my life. A

week later, I come back and they'd

moved to Mobile. "Miss Lazy

Fingers" scared I'd find a new job

before she moved...

MINNY (CONT'D)

We gots to get more maids!

AIBILEEN

I know, but it hard, Minny.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

You gone and done it now.

55.

MISS STEIN

I like this "Sarah Ross." She can

kvetch but not complain too much.

MISS STEIN

And this "Bertha"...she's got

chutzpah. I'll give her that.

SKEETER

So...you liked it?

MISS STEIN

Eugenia, Martin Luther King just

invited the country to march with

him in D.C. this August. This many

negroes and whites haven't worked

together since "Gone with the

Wind."

SKEETER

Does this mean you'll publish it?

MISS STEIN

I never said that. My advice is to

write it fast before this civil

rights thing blows over. I need it

by New Year's, and don't send me

anything more until you have twelve

maids.

SKEETER

Twelve?

MISS STEIN

At least.

MINNY

Aibileen and I done asked everbody

we know. Thirty-one maids.

Everbody too scared, think we

crazy...

SKEETER

Then we might as well stop!

56.

MINNY

I got plenty a stories, Miss

Skeeter. Just write`em down and

invent a maid that said it. We

already making up everbody's name.

Make up the maids, too.

SKEETER

We can't do that!

SKEETER (CONT'D)

I mean...I would never do that. It

wouldn't be real. It's wrong.

AIBILEEN

Don't give up on us, Miss Skeeter.

SKEETER

I'm sorry. Thank you both for

trying.

MINNY

What can you cook?

CELIA

I can cook corn pone, boil

potatoes, and do grits.

CELIA (CONT'D)

We didn't have electric current

where I was raised.

MINNY

Well, I reckon if there's anything

you ought to know `bout cooking...

57.

MINNY (CONT'D)

It's this. The most important

invention since they put mayonnaise

in a jar. You don't even know the

things you can do with this here

can.

CELIA

How pretty. Looks like frosting.

MINNY

Shake that.

CELIA

This is fun!

CELIA

Looks so good! I'm starved.

MINNY

You supposed to eat in the dining

room, Miss Celia. That how it

works.

MINNY (CONT'D)

Here, I'll take your plate in the

dinin' room for ya. Want tea?

CELIA

I'm fine right here, Minny.

CELIA (CONT'D)

I'm real grateful you're here.

MINNY

Miss Celia, you got a lot more to

be grateful for than me.

MINNY (CONT'D)

Mister Johnny?!

58.

CELIA

Oh, no! Hide!

CELIA (CONT'D)

Oh...It's just the florist. Johnny

must have sent me flowers.

MINNY

Miss Celia, I ain't playin' around

no more! He gone catch me here and

shoot me dead right here on this no-

wax floor! You gots to tell him.

Ain't he wondering how the cooking

so good?

CELIA FOOTE

You're right. Maybe we ought to

burn the chicken a little.

MINNY

Minny don't burn chicken.

CHARLOTTE

This is bound to work, Sweetie. It

even smells expensive.

SKEETER

I feel the hope in your fingers.

CHARLOTTE

How can you not know his last name?

SKEETER

He's William's cousin. That's all

I know.

CHARLOTTE

That's just so sweet of Hilly.

SKEETER

What is that?!

59.

CHARLOTTE

The Shinolator! It cost eleven

dollars. I'm a good mother.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

"The Miracle Straitening Cap" must

remain on the head for two hours."

SKEETER

Two hours?!

CHARLOTTE

I'll have Pascagoula bring you a

magazine.

SKEETER

Thanks, Constantine. Do you think

this dress is cute?

SKEETER (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. Thanks, Pascagoula.

PASCAGOLUA

I knew Constantine. She was a

mighty fine woman.

SKEETER

Holy shit.

CHARLOTTE

You've shrunk five inches. You'll

be able to wear heels tonight.

60.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

You're not leaving this house in

those awful, Mexican, man shoes.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

What time is he picking you up?

SKEETER

He's meeting me at Hilly's. Can I

take the Cadillac?

CHARLOTTE

We promised Carlton the Cadillac

tonight. So, William's cousin will

just have to come get you himself.

SKEETER

I'll take the truck.

CHARLOTTE

It's hooked to the motor grader.

SKEETER

I'll drive slow.

CHARLOTTE

Don't mope. Remember to smile!

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

And, don't sit like some squaw

Indian. Cross! Your! Ankles!

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

(SHOUTING)

I love you!

61.

WILLIAM

With your daddy's endorsement, I

can win that Senate seat.

STUART

I'll talk to him.

SKEETER

Hey.

HILLY

Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all

talk about quarterbacks or

something. Yule May, get Miss

Skeeter a Coca Cola.

HILLY

Skeeter, you don't even have on

lipstick!

62.

SKEETER

It was so goddamn awful. I hit a

cat.

HILLY

Well...What do you think of him?

SKEETER

He looks handsome.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

All right, give it to me. One to

ten?

HILLY

Seven.

SKEETER

Really?! Seven?

HILLY

Honey, you're beautiful. Just go

on out there...you're gonna do

great. It's your time, Skeeter. I

just know it.

STUART

You want a drink?

SKEETER

Just water, please.

STUART

(TO WAITER)

Double Old Kentucky straight...with

a water back...Make that two backs.

63.

SKEETER

THANKS?! So...you went to Alabama?

HILLY

"Roll Tide." We still love him.

SKEETER

Now you're in the oil business.

Hilly says you're a rigsite leader.

STUART

The money's good. If that's what

you really want to know.

SKEETER

That's not what I-

STUART

Isn't that your old boyfriend,

Hilly? Johnny Foote?

STUART (CONT'D)

Who's his girl? Lord, she's hotter

than Delta asphalt.

HILLY

William! The Lieutenant Governor

just walked in.

STUART

So, what do you do with your time?

SKEETER

I write a...a domestic maintenance

column for the Jackson Journal.

STUART

You mean housekeeping?

64.

STUART (CONT'D)

Jesus, I can't think of anything

worse than reading a cleaning

column. Except maybe writing one.

HILLY

We'd love your support on election

day!

JOHNNY

Hilly, you look lovely tonight.

HILLY

Thank you, Johnny.

JOHNNY

William, have you ever met Celia?

WILLIAM

Nice to meet you.

HILLY

Sweetie, we need to go order our

dinners.

CELIA FOOTE

Hilly, did you ever get the

messages that I've been calling

you?

HILLY

I did not.

CELIA FOOTE

Well, I would love to help with the

benefit. I have a lovely hand if

you need invitations addressed.

HILLY

"Save the dates" were mailed weeks

ago...You didn't get one?

HILLY (CONT'D)

Mail's a lot slower way out there

in the country, huh?

65.

HILLY (CONT'D)

(TO WILLIAM)

Now, come on, before they run out

of Trout Almondine.

STUART

Sounds like a ploy to find a

husband...becoming an expert on

keeping house.

SKEETER

Well, you must be a genius. You

figured out my whole scheme.

HILLY

What'd we miss?

STUART

Isn't that what you women from Ole

Miss major in? Professional

husband hunting?

SKEETER

I'm sorry, but were you dropped on

your head as an infant?

HILLY

Who? Is? Hungry?

SKEETER

Not me! A kiss from God couldn't

turn this `frog' into a `prince.'

STUART

Or you a `princess,' Sweetheart!

66.

HILLY

Run on, now, Yule May. Got a big

crowd coming for Miss Leefolt's

baby shower.

YULE MAY

Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you

and Mister William something.

YULE MAY (CONT'D)

My twin boys finished high school,

both on the honor roll...My husband

and I have been saving for years to

send them to college.

HILLY

Okay...

YULE MAY

We are short seventy-five dollars

on one of the tuitions.

WILLIAM

Well, I'm late. Gotta go.

HILLY

Go on...

YULE MAY

Now...We're faced with having to

choose. Which son gets to go...if

we don't find all the money.

YULE MAY (CONT'D)

Would you consider givin' us a

loan? I'll...I'll work for free

until it's paid off.

HILLY

That's not working for free, Yule

May. That's paying off a debt.

YULE MAY

Yes, ma'am.

HILLY

As a Christian, I'm going to do you

a favor.

67.

HILLY (CONT'D)

God doesn't give charity to those

who are well and able. You need to

come up with this money on your

own. You'll thank me one day.

MINNY

That's her.

MINNY (CONT'D)

Lord, she's trying to shop.

CELIA

(SHOUTS OUT)

Thanks, Doll!

MINNY

Miss Celia just don't see `em. The

lines. Not between us, Miss Hilly,

nobody.

MINNY (CONT'D)

What you so quiet for? I know you

got a opinion `bout all this.

AIBILEEN

You gone accuse me a

philosophizing.

MINNY

I ain't afraid a no philosophy.

68.

AIBILEEN

I don't believe in lines anymore.

Lines is in our heads `cause people

like Miss Hilly try to make us

believe they there.

MINNY

Oh, they there. I know. I get

punished for crossing them.

AIBILEEN

Lotta of folk think if you talk

back to your husband, you crossed a

line...need to be punished.

MINNY

You know I ain't studying no line

like that.

AIBILEEN

Cause it ain't there. `Cept in

Leroy's head. Lines between black

and white ain't there either.

MINNY

So, I ain't crossing no line if I

tell Miss Celia she ain't good

enough for Miss Hilly? Tell her

she ain't in Miss Hilly's league?

AIBILEEN

All I'm saying is kindness don't

have no boundaries.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

Law, the Evers children have gotten

so big!

MINNY

(QUIETLY)

Cause they happy. Myrlie got her a

good man...And you better not try

to say they ain't no line between

her Medgar and my Leroy.

69.

AIBILEEN

No. You got me.

MAE MOBLEY

Mae Mo hungry, Momma.

ELIZABETH

She's always hungry.

SKEETER

You know she can hear you,

Elizabeth?

AIBILEEN

I'm on cut you some cake, Baby.

ELIZABETH

Aibileen, we gave that scraper to

Hilly and William for their wedding

present. Chantilly!

AIBILEEN

It so pretty.

HILLY

Aibileen, are you enjoying your new

bathroom over at Elizabeth's?

70.

HILLY (CONT'D)

Nice to have your own, isn't it?

AIBILEEN

Yes, ma'am.

HILLY

Separate but equal. That's what

Ross Barnett says, and you can't

argue with the Governor.

SKEETER

Not in Mississippi. Birthplace of

modern day government.

HILLY

Aibileen, did you know that me and

Mister Holbrook arranged for that

bathroom? Sent the boys over and

the equipment, too.

AIBILEEN

Yes, ma'am...And I thank you.

HILLY

Well...You. Are. Welcome.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

One thing I got to say about Miss

Hilly, she love her children.

Always tellin' them they smart and

beautiful. Can't go more than ten

minutes without givin' one a kiss.

AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And, law, do they love her back.

When she starts up on me, I just

try and think a my sweet Treelore

and how much he loved me. That

kind a love makes me cry. Even

when it going to Miss Hilly.

71.

YULE MAY

May I get you something?

SKEETER

No, thanks...

(HUSHED)

Yule May, I wanted to talk to you.

YULE MAY

I know what you want to ask, Miss

Skeeter. Aibileen and Minny

already did.

YULE MAY (CONT'D)

I'm trying to get my boys off to

college. It's worthwhile what

y'all doing, but my boys are worth

more.

SKEETER

I understand.

HILLY (O.C.)

What do you "understand," Skeeter?

SKEETER

Ah...Yule May was just telling me

how excited she was that her boys

were going to go to college.

HILLY

Is that true, Yule May?

YULE MAY

Yes, Ma'am.

HILLY

Did you also ask Miss Skeeter if

you could borrow money?

SKEETER

Of course not, Hilly!

HILLY

Skeeter, I'm starting to think

you're intentionally not putting my

initiative in the newsletter.

72.

SKEETER

Not at all. I'm just so busy right

now with Mom.

HILLY

Skeeter...I'm sorry about your

mother. And I know you must be so

worried.

HILLY (CONT'D)

But I'm worried about you. All

this carrying on lately and now

you're reading this stuff?

SKEETER

My dad had me get that for him.

HILLY

I mean, around your friends is one

thing...But, believe it or not,

there are real racists in this

town! If the wrong person caught

you with this...you'd be in serious

trouble.

SKEETER

Thanks, Hilly! And thanks for

going through my things.

73.

CHARLOTTE

Skeeter!

SKEETER

What?!

CHARLOTTE

Don't panic, but there's a very

tall man named Stuart here for you.

SKEETER

He's a drunken asshole, Mother.

You wouldn't like him.

CHARLOTTE

Skeeter, love and hate are two

horns on the same goat. And, you

need a goat!

CHARLOTTE

Stuart, would you like a cocktail?

STUART

No, Ma'am. Little too early.

SKEETER

Ha!

CHARLOTTE

What's your last name, Stuart?

STUART

Whitworth.

CHARLOTTE

Hmm...Where are you from?

STUART

Natchez.

CHARLOTTE

Really? Well, I know a Whitworth

from Natchez...But he's a Senator

up in Washington.

74.

STUART

Yes, Ma'am. That's my daddy.

CHARLOTTE

Who is?

STUART

Senator Whitworth. That's my

father.

CHARLOTTE

Really?

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

Well...tell him I said

"Hello"...I'm going to go see if

Pascagoula needs some help in the

kitchen.

STUART

Look. I know it was a few weeks

back, but I came here to say I'm

sorry for the way I acted.

SKEETER

Who sent you? William or Hilly?

STUART

Neither. I was rude, and I've been

thinking about it a lot.

SKEETER

Well, I haven't. So, just go.

STUART

Now, look. I told Hilly I wasn't

ready to go out on any date. I

wasn't even close to ready.

STUART (CONT'D)

I was engaged last year. She ended

it.

75.

STUART (CONT'D)

We'd been dating since we were

fifteen. You know how it is.

SKEETER

Actually, I don't. I've never

dated anyone before.

STUART

Well! That must be it then.

SKEETER

What?

STUART

I've never met a woman that said

exactly what she was thinking.

SKEETER

I've got plenty to say...

STUART

Would you like to...come downtown

with me and have dinner? We could

talk... We could listen to each

other this time.

SKEETER

I can't think of anything worse.

STUART

Then, I'm sorry. That's what I

came to say and...I said it.

SKEETER

Just give me a minute!

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Let me get my sweater.

STUART

What do you want, Skeeter?

76.

SKEETER

I'll have a Co-cola. Lots of ice.

STUART

No, I mean in life. What do you

want?

SKEETER

I want to be a journalist. Maybe a

novelist. Maybe both.

STUART

I like that...I've been thinking

about you. You're smart, you're

pretty, you're...tall!

SKEETER

Pretty?

STUART

Yes. And I read your column. Very

informative.

(SMILING)

I never knew Crisco got rid of

diaper rash.

STUART (CONT'D)

I hope you get to write something

really good, Skeeter. Something

you believe in.

AIBILEEN

Baby girl home.

77.

ELIZABETH (O.C.)

Aibileen! My trunk's full!

ELIZABETH (O.C.) (CONT'D)

Mae Mobley! No! Stop!

MAE MOBLEY

ELIZABETH

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

This is dirty out here! You'll

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

AIBILEEN

I'm here, baby girl. Aibee's here.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

You is kind. You is smart. You is

important...You want me to tell you

one a our secret stories?

ELIZABETH (O.C.)

I got it!

78.

AIBILEEN

One day this wise Martian come down

to Earth to teach us people a thing

or two.

MAE MOBLEY

Martian? How big?

AIBILEEN

Oh, he about six-two.

MAE MOBLEY

What's his name?

AIBILEEN

Martian Luther King.

MAE MOBLEY

What did he look like?

AIBILEEN

Looked just like us, nose, mouth,

hair on his head. But, sometimes

people looked at him funny and were

just downright mean to him.

MAE MOBLEY

Why Aibee? Why was they so mean?

AIBILEEN

`Cause he was green.

ELIZABETH

Aibileen! Come on! We have to go

help Hilly. Now! Come on!

79.

MAE MOBLEY

Look! Look, Aibee.

HILLY

Get out of here!

HILLY (CONT'D)

Skeeter! She put it in the

newsletter. I specifically said

old coats are to be dropped at my

house. Not commodes!

HILLY (CONT'D)

She put it in the newsletter when

she knew we'd be down at the beach.

HILLY (CONT'D)

Go help those boys GET THOSE

TOILETS OFF MY LAWN!

DRIVER

Y'all stay put. Let me find out

what's going on.

YOUNG BLACK MAN

What happen up there, Mister?

DRIVER

Colored people off. White people

lemme know where y'all are going.

I'll get you as close as I can.

80.

WHITE PASSENGER

What's going on?

DRIVER

I don't know. Some nigger got

shot. Where you headed?

YOUNG BLACK MAN

You all right? You close to home?

AIBILEEN

I be all right. My house is seven

blocks from here.

YOUNG BLACK MAN

Want me to walk you?

AIBILEEN

Naw, thank ya. I'll be fine...Law,

I hope this ain't as bad as-

MINNY

Aibileen! You okay?

81.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

Almost ten years serving as the

Field Secretary for the

NAACP...Medgar Evers is dead.

MINNY

KKK shot him! Hour ago. Right in

front a his children, Aibileen.

AIBILEEN

We gone pray for the Evers. We

gone pray for Myrlie.

MINNY

We living in hell! We trapped.

Our kids is trapped.

MINNY (CONT'D)

Take your brother and sister and go

get in my bed. Stay there!

MINNY (CONT'D)

What they gone do to us if they

catch us with Miss Skeeter?

AIBILEEN

We gone be careful.

MINNY

Hitch us to a pickup and drag us

behind? Shoot me front a my kids?

AIBILEEN

We ain't doing civil rights with

Miss Skeeter. We just tellin'

stories like they really happen.

MINNY

You a fool, old woman. A fool!

MINNY (CONT'D)

I can't believe I'm on say this...

But, I actually wish Leroy was home

right now.

82.

"Come on by, have a seat!"

I guess you potty trained Hilly!

Much love, Stuart.

HILLY

You are sick. Do not speak to me.

Do not look at me. Don't say hello

to my children. How long had you

been planning to humiliate my

family?

SKEETER

That's not it, Hilly.

HILLY

You thought you were so clever,

didn't ya? But I've already

installed three of those old

toilets in people's garages.

SKEETER

Technically, it was a typo, Hilly.

HILLY

I intend to tell Stuart he's

ruining his reputation by

associating with you. Jolene's

yard boy saw you hanging around the

colored bus stop.

SKEETER

I wasn't hanging-

83.

HILLY

I guess your car was in the shop?

HILLY (CONT'D)

You know as well as I do, people

won't buy so much as a slice of

pound cake from an organization

that harbors racial

integrationists!

SKEETER

Hilly, just who is that pound cake

money being raised for, anyway?

HILLY

"The Starving Children of Africa."

HILLY (CONT'D)

Just so you know, Lou Ann Templeton

has taken your seat at bridge club.

MINNY

Miss Celia?

MINNY

Miss Celia, you in here?

MINNY (CONT'D)

Hello? You sick?

CELIA (O.C.)

I'm fine. Minny. Go on home for

the day.

MINNY

You mess up your hair coloring

again? I helped you fix it last

time, got it back real pretty.

84.

CELIA (O.C.)

I said go home, Minny!

MINNY

Miss Celia!

CELIA

There's so much blood. Why is

there so much blood this time?

CELIA (CONT'D)

Please, Minny. Will you get it

out? I can't look at it again.

MINNY

Keep your head down.

CELIA'S POV:

DOCTOR

Give her another pill if she gets

too agitated. There'll be more

bleeding, but don't call me unless

it's heavy.

CELIA

We got married because I was

pregnant. But it slipped out too.

85.

MINNY

That's just God's way. Next one's

gonna catch.

CELIA

Johnny wants kids now. I thought

if I was real still, brought

somebody in to do the house and

cooking, maybe I'd hold on to this

one. Oh, Minny, what's he gonna do

with me?

MINNY

He gone have to get over this. He

needs to know this takes time.

CELIA

He doesn't know about this one, or

the one before...

CELIA FOOTE

Minny, you know how to play bridge,

don't you?

MINNY

Yes, ma'am. I used to help Missus

Walters practice.

AIBILEEN

Happy Birthday! Mae Mobley two

today!

MAE MOBLEY

Mae Mobley three!

AIBILEEN

You sure is, Baby Girl. Blow'em

out `fo they run up in your grits.

MAE MOBLEY

How old are you, Aibiee?

AIBILEEN

Fifty-three.

MAE MOBLEY

Do you get burfdays?

86.

AIBILEEN

Gone be fifty-four next week.

MAE MOBLEY

Do you have some babies?

AIBILEEN

I gots seventeen of `em.

MAE MOBLEY

Where are the babies?

AIBILEEN

They all over town.

MAE MOBLEY

Aibee...You're my real mama.

AIBILEEN

Now, you know who your momma is.

MAE MOBLEY

I'm your real baby, Aibee. Those

other ones are just pretend.

HILLY

Okay. First order of business.

We're updating our newsletter.

87.

HILLY (CONT'D)

We're adding a fashion column with

all the latest trends...Your

dresses better be cute at next

week's benefit!

HILLY (CONT'D)

Now it's time to choose a new

editor for our new modern monthly.

JOLENE FRENCH

I nominate Hilly Holbrook.

HILLY

Jolene, you're the sweetest thing!

OTHER MEMBERS

I second. I third. All in favor

of Hilly, say "Aye."

MEMBERS

Aye!

ELIZABETH

(MOUTHING)

I'm so sorry.

CHARLOTTE

Honey, would you like me to drop

you off at bridge club on the way

to my doctor's appointment?

SKEETER

(COVERING)

No, Ma'am. It's been cancelled.

Mae Mobley's sick or something.

88.

AIBILEEN

Everything okay?

ELIZABETH

Shhh!

CELIA (O.C.)

Elizabeth, it's me, Celia Foote. I

was in the neighborhood and thought

I'd drop by.

CELIA (CONT'D)

I...brought you a chocolate

pie...My maid, Minny, made it.

CELIA

They made me stand there like the

vacuum man. Why, Minny?

MINNY

Because they know about you getting

knocked up by Mister Johnny. They

mad you married one a they mens.

Especially since Mister Johnny and

Miss Hilly had just broke up, too.

CELIA

So, Hilly probably thinks I was

fooling around with Johnny while

they were still going steady.

89.

MINNY

Missus Walters says Miss Hilly

still sweet on Mister Johnny, too.

CELIA

No wonder! They don't hate

me...They hate what they think I

did!

MINNY

They hate you cause they think

you're white trash! And don't be

takin' pies to those women!

CELIA

Well, I'm just going to have to let

Hilly know I'm not a boyfriend

stealer. In fact, I'll tell her

Friday night at the benefit.

MINNY

Now, Miss Celia...please don't be

going to that benefit.

MINNY (CONT'D)

Did you hear what I said?

MINNY (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

CELIA

That looks bad.

MINNY

I got to get my work done.

CELIA

I know you didn't fall in the tub,

Minny. Let me take a look.

90.

JOHNNY (O.C.)

Come here, Sexy!

CELIA(O.C.)

Johnny, you are bad! Bad! Bad!

SKEETER

What's wrong?

AIBILEEN

Yule May in prison, Miss Skeeter.

Gone be there four years.

MINNY

Hilly Holbrook been sent from the

devil to ruirn all our lives.

HILLY

Please! A nigra walks in a pawn

shop with a ring of such size and

clarity. It took'em all of five

minutes to figure out where she

worked.

HILLY (CONT'D)

I knew that girl was a thief the

day she started.

SKEETER

I'll ask daddy to get her a good

lawyer.

91.

MINNY

She had a lawyer. A white lawyer!

But Miss Hilly friends with the

judge's wife. Whole thing took two

days. Arrested on Tuesday, in the

state pen by Wednesday.

AIBILEEN

The church gone send them boys to

college. Gone pass the plate `til

they graduate...

PEARLY

I'm on help with your stories.

BLACK WOMAN

I'm on help too.

BLACK WOMAN 2

We all are.

SKEETER

Thank you. I don't know what to-

MINNY

(STERNLY)

They doing this for Yule May.

PEARLY

Been there thirty-eight years and

Miss Margaret still makes me put my

hair up in a rag. Say she know

coloreds don't wash theys hair.

But, I love her. She love me too.

DISSOLVE TO:

CORA

I had been workin' for Miss

Jolene's mother up `til she died.

Then her daughter, Miss Nancy,

asked me to come work for her.

Miss Nancy a real sweet lady.

92.

CORA (CONT'D)

But her momma left it in the will

that I had to work for her

daughter, Miss Jolene. Miss Jolene

a mean woman. Mean for sport. I

tried to get another job, but in

everbody mind, the French family

and Miss Jolene owned me.

DISSOLVE TO:

CALLIE

I used to take a shortcut ever day

to work at Doctor Dixon's house.

Cut through this farmer's lower

forty to get there. One day, that

farmer was waitin' on me with a

gun, said he'd shoot me dead if I

walk on his land again. Doctor

Dixon went and paid that farmer

double for two a those acres. Told

him he `bout to start farmin' too.

But he bought it just for me. So I

could get to work easy. He did.

GRETCHEN

All these colored women have been

real nice, haven't they?

SKEETER

Yes. Very nice.

GRETCHEN

Well, they hate you. You know

this? Every little thing about

you. But you're so dumb, you think

you're doing them a favor.

SKEETER

You don't have to do this.

GRETCHEN

You know the nicest thing a white

woman's ever done for me? Gave me

the heel of her bread. These women

are playing a trick on you.

They'll never tell you the truth!

93.

SKEETER

You don't know what they've said.

GRETCHEN

Say it, lady, say the word you

think every time one us stands in

front of you. Nigger.

AIBILEEN

That's enough, Gretchen.

GRETCHEN

You just as dumb as she is.

AIBILEEN

Get out a my house!

AIBILEEN

Tell her to pour vinegar in her

trash cans. Then them dogs will

stay away.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

Today my birthday, Miss Skeeter.

SKEETER

Well, happy birthday, Aibileen.

You should have told me.

AIBILEEN

And, from all over the county, my

babies find they way home.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

Some even from overseas. Alton

Spears lives in Paris now. Married

him a real pretty French girl. Got

five kids, too...they's my

grandbabies.

94.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

I still don't drink coffee. Happy

Birthday. Love Alton.

CHARLOTTE (O.C.)

Eugenia?!

SKEETER

What?!

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Oh my God! Oh my God!

SKEETER (CONT'D)

Don't move a muscle!

CHARLOTTE

Morning, Sleepy Head.

95.

SKEETER

Morning, Mom.

CHARLOTTE

I thought you could take me to the

doctor this morning and then we

could get some lunch afterwards.

SKEETER

Sure!

CHARLOTTE

(looking at toe)

Or...we could...go straight to

Fanny Mae's for a girl day.

SKEETER

Great! I'll get dressed.

CHARLOTTE

When did Stuart leave last night?

SKEETER

Right after you went to bed.

CHARLOTTE

Well, I hope he knows he's welcome

to stay in Carlton's old room.

SKEETER

I'm not really ready for that yet.

CHARLOTTE

"Bird in the hand," Eugenia. Bird.

In. The. Hand...

STUART

(under the covers.)

Chirp. Chirp.

SKEETER

Oh my God!

SKEETER (CONT'D)

My breath is horrible.

STUART

So is mine.

96.

STUART (CONT'D)

I love you.

SKEETER

I love you, too.

97.

STUART

Honey, I'm sorry, but I have to get

down to the coast.

STUART (CONT'D)

I'll be back in time for the

benefit. Love you.

SKEETER

You, too.

SKEETER

Are you okay?

AIBILEEN

The world done gone crazy, Miss

Skeeter! And I'm scared! What if

folks find out what we writing?

Figure out Niceville really

Jackson, and figure out who who?

SKEETER

Aibileen. We've changed all the

names.

AIBILEEN

Y'all two gone sit there and tell

me you one hundred percent without

a doubt sure `bout all this?!

MINNY

No...So I been thinking...Maybe we

need us some insurance.

MINNY (CONT'D)

I told God I'd never speak of it

again. But we got no choice. It's

time...Time to tell you both "the

terrible awful" I did to Miss

Hilly. It might be the only thing

to protect us.

98.

HILLY

Nobody wanted to hire a sass-

mouthing, thieving nigra, did they?

HILLY (CONT'D)

Pie's as good as always, Minny.

MINNY

I'm glad you like it.

HILLY

If...I take you back, I'll have to

cut your pay five dollars a week.

MINNY

Take me back?

HILLY

What do you put in here that makes

it taste so good?

MINNY

That good vanilla from Mexico...

MINNY (CONT'D)

And...something else real special.

MINNY (CONT'D)

No, Missus Walters. That Miss

Hilly's special pie.

HILLY

Momma can have a piece.

HILLY (CONT'D)

Cut her one.

99.

MINNY

(IMMEDIATELY)

Eat my shit.

HILLY

What did you say?

MINNY

I said eat my shit!

HILLY

Have you lost your mind?!

MINNY

No. But you're about to,

`cause you just did.

HILLY

Did what?

MISSUS WALTERS

Well, Hilly, that's what you get, I

guess. And you didn't just eat

one. You ate two slices!

AIBILEEN

You trying to get yourself killed?!

MINNY

No! I never planned to tell her!

I just wanted to see her take a

bite and leave so I could be done

with her. Forever! She was never

supposed to ask me back.

MINNY (CONT'D)

And, then for less pay! That got

me even madder. And, then she went

slid that pie at me. Oh lord!

That was it! I just lost control,

Aibileen...you know how I get, now.

100.

MINNY (CONT'D)

So, before I knew it, it just came

on out my mouth...and I had tolt

her what was in that pie.

MINNY (CONT'D)

I've asked God to forgive me. But,

more for what happened to poor

Missus Walters. Miss Hilly threw

her in that nursing home just for

laughing.

AIBILEEN

(GRAVELY)

We can't put that story in the

book.

SKEETER

It's too dangerous, Minny.

MINNY

We need insurance! Hilly Holbrook

can't never let people know that

pie story is about her.

AIBILEEN

Exactly! If people find out "The

Terrible Awful" was you and Miss

Hilly, then we in trouble. Trouble

there ain't words for!

MINNY

Right! But don't you see? Miss

Hilly gone go to her grave

convincing people this book ain't

about Jackson. Then we safe,

insured!

MINNY (CONT'D)

You brought me into this, and I'm

on finish it! Either put it in or

pull my parts out all together.

MISS STEIN

The last editor's meeting is

December 17th. If you want a

chance of this getting read, I need

it in my hands by then.

SKEETER

But that's in a week, Miss Stein!

101.

MISS STEIN

Otherwise it goes in The Pile. You

don't want it in The Pile.

SKEETER

Yes, Ma'am.

MISS STEIN

And you must get a piece in about

the domestic who raised you. It'll

add something personal to it.

JOLENE

This is Jolene French reporting

from the African Children's Benefit

Ball, and I'm here with League

President Miss Hilly Holbrook.

HILLY

Thanks, Jolene...

OLD HUSBAND

(a little too loudly)

Look at the jugs on that one!

102.

OLD WIFE

Bosoms are for bedrooms and breast-

feeding. Not occasions of dignity.

CELIA

Do you think I might have

overdressed a little? It's

supposed to be formal, but this

looks like a funeral.

JOHNNY

You look gorgeous.

MINNY

Look what she got on.

AIBILEEN

Lord have mercy. Ladies better

hold onto they husbands tonight.

MINNY

(REGARDING JOHNNY)

And that's the man that don't even

know he's paying me.

AIBILEEN

There's Skeeter and that must be

Stuart. He's handsome... Missus

Walters?!

MINNY

Hilly can throw her in a home, but

she can't keep the taxis away.

CELIA

Well, hello, Elizabeth.

103.

ELIZABETH

Hi.

CELIA

Those are lovely dresses.

JOLENE

Yours too.

CELIA

Really?! I was worried I was a tad

overdressed.

JOLENE

Oh, no. You're just perfect.

HILLY

Everybody enjoying their dinner?

HILLY (CONT'D)

(FLATLY)

Let's give a nice round of applause

for all the men and women that have

helped make tonight possible.

HILLY (CONT'D)

A cause I'm sure is dear to their

hearts as well.

CELIA

Woo-hoo!

JOHNNY

Honey, maybe you've had enough to

drink. Try to eat your dinner.

104.

CELIA

And have my stomach poke out?!

HILLY

Why, Johnny Foote. I'm surprised

to see you here. Everybody knows

you can't stand parties like this.

JOHNNY

Celia wouldn't have missed this for

anything.

HILLY

Where is that wife of yours? Out

selling hotdogs?

HILLY (CONT'D)

Oh, you know I'm teasing you. We

dated long enough where I can do

that, can't I?

HILLY (CONT'D)

(FLATLY)

Stuart.

STUART

(FLATTER)

Hilly.

JOLENE

I've got the list of winners!

JOLENE

I hope you enjoy your new set of

tires, Missus Atwell. Now, on to

the baked goods.

105.

JOLENE (CONT'D)

Oh, yum! Yum! The highest bid in

baked goods goes to Minny Jackson's

chocolate pie. Congratulations,

Hilly Holbrook!

HILLY

What? I didn't bid on anything.

HILLY (CONT'D)

Well, wasn't that sweet. Someone

signed me up for that pie.

SKEETER

(TO STUART)

Oh, no.

CELIA

Congratulations, Hilly! I didn't

know you're a fan of Minny's pies.

CELIA (CONT'D)

I've wanted to talk to you all

night. Minny told me why you won't

be my friend. You think me and

Johnny went behind your back.

HILLY

Let me go!

STUART

Oh, God.

CELIA

I'm so sorry.

HILLY

(GRITTED TEETH)

What are you trying to do to me?

What are you and that nigra up to?

106.

CELIA

I don't know what you-

HILLY

-You liar! Who did you tell?!

CELIA

Hilly, I got pregnant after you and

Johnny broke up!

MISSUS WALTERS

Oh, shit.

HILLY

Shut up, Mother.

CELIA

Johnny never cheated on you...At

least, not with me.

HILLY

Johnny would never-

CELIA

And I'm sorry I thought you'd be

tickled to win that pie.

HILLY

You tell that nigra if she tells

anybody, I will make her suffer.

JOHNNY

Celia, what's wrong, Honey?

CELIA

Uh-oh.

107.

JOHNNY

Oh, shit!

HILLY

Get that cleaned up before it

starts to smell.

AIBILEEN

Yes, ma'am.

SUGAR

That big-boobed lady Momma works

for was drunker than an Injun on

payday. Upchucked in front a

everbody!

MINNY

Don't you never let me hear you

talking bad about the lady who puts

food in your mouth. Clothes on

your back! You hear me?

SUGAR

(TO HERSELF)

You do it all the time.

HILLY

Just come on home and stay with us

tonight, Mother.

MISSUS WALTERS

No thanks, I got a pie to eat.

108.

HILLY

You throw that pie away right now!

MISSUS WALTERS

I spent good money on this. Won it

just for you...

HILLY

You?! You signed me up?

MISSUS WALTERS

I may have trouble remembering my

own name and what country I live

in. But there's two things I can't

seem to forget. That my own

daughter threw me in a nursing

home...And that she ate Minny's

shit.

MINNY

Ain't Mister Johnny gone wonder how

dinner got on the table if you laid

up in bed?

CELIA

The way Hilly looked at me. Like I

was trash on the road.

CELIA (CONT'D)

She billed me for her dress. In

lieu of payment, she's asked that I

send two-hundred dollars to the

African Children's Fund and then

she banned me from all future

League events.

MINNY

She don't count. Don't judge

yourself by the way she see you.

CELIA

I'm not right for this kind of

life, Minny. I don't need a dinner

table for twelve people.

109.

CELIA (CONT'D)

I couldn't get two people over here

if I begged. She called me a liar

and accused me of getting her that

pie. I wouldn't have thrown up if

it wasn't for that! I can't do

this anymore to Johnny. I'm going

back to Sugar Ditch.

MINNY

You gone leave your husband cause

you threw up at some party?

MINNY (CONT'D)

Lord, I reckon it's time you knew.

MINNY

Miss Hilly thought you knew `bout

"The Terrible Awful," that you were

making fun a her. It's my fault

she pounced on you. But if you

leave Mister Johnny, then Miss

Hilly done won the whole ball game.

Then she done beat me, and she done

beat you.

CELIA

Thank you. For telling me that.

STUART

Hey, Honey.

SKEETER

Stuart! How are you calling me?

Aren't you on the rig?

STUART

What if I told you I have twenty-

four hours in New Orleans?

110.

STUART (CONT'D)

That I'm in the Presidential Suite

of the Roosevelt Hotel...That we

have dinner reservations in the

Blue Room tonight and lunch

tomorrow at Galatoires.

STUART (CONT'D)

Did you hear me? I spoke to your

dad, and he's gonna have Jameso

drive you down right now.

SKEETER

Oh, Stuart.

STUART

What?

SKEETER

I have to work.

STUART

Work in the car. Jesus, Skeeter,

it's a cleaning column.

SKEETER

I have a deadline, Sweetie. You

should have asked me about this.

STUART

I'm trying to be romantic...

SKEETER

I'm sorry, Honey. I can't come.

FAYE BELLE

I remember hiding with Miss Lilia

in a steamer trunk while Yankee

soldiers stomped through Master's

house. We were both four. Eighty-

five years later she died in my

arms. We's were friends `til the

end. Her grandson still pays my

rent. Buys all my groceries too.

111.

SKEETER

I have one more story to type, but

other than that, we are done.

AIBILEEN

Law, look at all them pages. Two-

hundred and sixty-six of `em.

MINNY

Now we just wait and see? Hopin'

Missus Stein publish it?

MINNY (CONT'D)

What story you got left to type?

SKEETER

Mine.

AIBILEEN

If your momma won't tell you, I

reckon I will.

CHARLOTTE

Have you been crying? You know

that ages your skin, Dear.

SKEETER

Mother, I need to talk to you about

Constantine.

CHARLOTTE

Oh, Eugenia. That was so long ago.

SKEETER

Well, I have to speak to her.

CHARLOTTE

Now, you look. I was good to

Constantine. Oh, she talked back

plenty of times, and I put up with

it. But, Skeeter, she didn't give

me a choice...

SKEETER

What...happened?

112.

CHARLOTTE (V.O.)

I was hosting a D.A.R. luncheon.

Constantine was to do the floors

that morning so they'd be dry in

time.

CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Well, the floors were soaking wet

when the first guest arrived.

CHARLOTTE (V.O.)

Then, she burned the coffee. She

had gotten so old, Skeeter.

CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Her mishaps were becoming a daily

occurrence, and I had had it.

WOMAN

Watch out!

CHARLOTTE

Get a hold of yourself,

Constantine!

113.

CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And that's when it happened.

CHARLOTTE

I told her she couldn't work here

anymore and to go on home.

SKEETER

How could you humiliate her like

that?!

CHARLOTTE

I didn't mean to.

SKEETER

Why didn't you help her?

CHARLOTTE

I was upset. I didn't know what

else to do.

SKEETER

So you just threw her away? That

woman did you the biggest favor of

your life. She taught me kindness

and self respect and you just threw

her away like a broken appliance.

114.

CHARLOTTE

I didn't throw her away, Skeeter.

Your daddy went to her house the

very next day to give her her job

back. But she had already moved to

Chicago. Left everything behind.

SKEETER

`Cause she didn't have anything

anymore. You broke her heart!

CHARLOTTE

Please don't do this to me,

Skeeter. I feel terrible. And you

have to remember, they're not like

us. They are different.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

And you idolized her too much! You

always have!

SKEETER

I needed somebody to look up to.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

I have to go find her. She needs

me.

CHARLOTTE

We finally found the address of her

daughter in Chicago...so we sent

Carlton up there to go get

Constantine.

SKEETER

And?

CHARLOTTE

When he got there...she was dead,

Eugenia. I'm so sorry, Honey.

SKEETER

Why didn't y'all tell me all this?

CHARLOTTE

I knew you'd blame me...when it

wasn't my fault. It just happened,

and it was so unfortunate. I'm

sorry, Eugenia.

SKEETER

When did she die? How long had she

been in Chicago?

115.

CHARLOTTE

Two weeks.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Constantine's story finally made it

in our book. But the reason she

got fired did not. Miss Skeeter

just couldn't put that kind a shame

on her own mother.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

They printed a few thousand copies

with the worst advance Miss Stein

had ever seen.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

We got four hundred dollars. Got

another four hundred when it got

printed. Divided thirteen ways

that came to sixty-one fifty-three

a person.

116.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Minny got so excited she burnt up a

skillet of chicken.

MINNY

Come on, Miss Celia! Get out a

that bed and let me in. It's

twelve noon. I did all the

shopping just like you asked.

MINNY (CONT'D)

Well, look at you, Miss Celia.

MINNY

What's all this?

CELIA

I cooked it all by myself. I wanted

to do something special. I wanted

to say "thank you."

MINNY

Greens got just the right amount a

hock taste to `em. That's a good

pot liquor, Miss Celia. Who taught

you to cook like this?

MINNY (CONT'D)

Corn bread's happy now.

CELIA

Are you happy, Minny?

MINNY

Why you ask such a funny question?

117.

CELIA

Are you?

MINNY

A course I's happy. You happy too.

Big house, big yard, good husband.

CELIA

You know, if I were you, I'd give

it right back to him. I'd hit him

over the head with a skillet and

tell him to go straight to hell...

MINNY

Maybe I will.

CELIA

I almost forgot the dessert.

SHOW RUNNER

Five, four, three, two, one.

MALE HOST

Welcome back to "People Will Talk."

And do we have something to talk

about. Jolene has quite a book to

review.

118.

HILLY

Why are you frowning, Jolene?

HILLY (CONT'D)

You don't look cute that way.

LEEFOLT HOUSE

MALE HOST

It's called "The Help." A new book

by an anonymous author.

MALE HOST (CONT'D)

Touching and enlightening, it's

filled with testimonials from

Mississippi's own housekeepers.

CELIA

Look how cute that dress is.

MALE HOST

Takes place in the fictional town

of "Niceville." The book is

dedicated to C and T. If you're

out there C and T, we'd love to

have you on the show because

Niceville sounds like Jackson, if

you ask me.

JOLENE FRENCH

It's not Jackson! It's a disgrace

to the South! A disgrace to good

Southern women who've spent their

lives taking care of their help.

LEEFOLT HOME

MALE HOST

But did you read that ending?

JOLENE FRENCH

I know I personally treat my help

like family, and every one of my

friends does the same.

119.

MALE HOST

(INTO CAMERA)

Bertha, if you're listening, I have

a new found respect for what you

do. And, believe me, I'll be

passin' on dessert at your table!

JOLENE FRENCH

Do not buy this book! Ladies of

Jackson, do not support slander

with your husband's hard earned-

HILLY'S HOME

HILLY

Don't cut her off like that.

LEEFOLT HOME

ELIZABETH

What's that book called, Aibileen?

AIBILEEN

I...I wasn't paying attention.

SKEETER

I knew nothing about it. Miss

Stein's P.R. Department called the

station directly.

120.

AIBILEEN

Ever maid callin' to say they white

lady's gone and bought the book.

They so scared.

MINNY

`One-arm-Earnestine' said Miss

Leefolt brought a copy over to Miss

Hilly in less than a hour. She

better read it quick and start the

"this ain't Jackson crusade."

SKEETER

Don't count on it. In her one year

at Ole Miss she never cracked a

book.

MINNY

Oh, she gone read it. Especially

after that man made such a stink on

the tee-vee. She gone read it.

121.

STUART

That month felt like a year. I

missed you so much.

SKEETER

Me, too.

STUART

Skeeter, I told Daddy I'm not going

back on the rig.

SKEETER

Stuart...I have to tell you

something.

STUART

How about "yes?!" I had this with

me down in New Orleans, you know.

SKEETER

I'm serious...and...you have to

promise not to tell anyone.

STUART

Hang on. Did you say `yes'?

SKEETER

Yes.

SKEETER (CONT'D)

But listen. Can I have your word?

STUART

Sure. You have my word.

STUART

This is what you've been writing

for the last twelve months?! What

happened to the cleaning column?

SKEETER

I did both.

122.

STUART

So, the talk in town? I said they

were dead wrong. Told them you

were too smart to get mixed up in

anything like that.

STUART (CONT'D)

That joke you played on Hilly with

the toilets. Hell, that's funny.

But this? I don't understand why

you did this...why you even care.

SKEETER

What?

STUART

Things are fine around here. Why

stir up trouble?

SKEETER

I'm not stirring up trouble,

Stuart. Trouble's already here.

STUART

I guess it is.

SKEETER

I had to tell you. You needed to

know.

STUART

I guess I don't really know you,

Skeeter. And I can't marry somebody

I don't know.

STUART (CONT'D)

That was my grandmother's.

STUART (CONT'D)

Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

SKEETER

Just leave.

123.

CHARLOTTE

Skeeter?! Come in here, please.

SKEETER

You okay? Can I get you anything?

CHARLOTTE

Come here, Eugenia. I want to tell

you something.

SKEETER

Me, too.

CHARLOTTE

You go first.

SKEETER

Stuart proposed.

CHARLOTTE

Finally!

SKEETER

You knew?

CHARLOTTE

Of course. He had to ask Daddy for

your hand.

SKEETER

Just say it.

CHARLOTTE

What did you do?!

SKEETER

Nothing!

CHARLOTTE

Young lady, I'm talking to you!

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

Stuart'll come around. It's a funny

dance.

(points to Robert )

Took this one a year. Anyway, my

news. After a long talk with your

daddy, I've made a decision. My

health's been on the uptick these

past few weeks. And I know the

doctor says it's some kind of last

STRENGTH NONSENSE-

124.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

But, as I said, I made a decision.

I have decided not to die.

SKEETER

Oh, Momma.

CHARLOTTE

Too late. I tried calling Fanny

Mae's so I could make your hair

appointments for the next twenty

years, but they wouldn't allow it.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

I certainly can't leave you now.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

The voters of Hinds County had

spoke. Mister Holbrook wasn't gone

have no political career.

125.

SUGAR

Momma, there's a white man at our

door!

MAN (O.C.)

Minny Jackson! Are you in there?!

MAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)

I can hear you. Open the door.

MINNY

Who there?

MAN

Johnny Foote. Minny Jackson, I

want to talk to you. Open up.

JOHNNY

Finally, I meet Minny Jackson...

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

What the hell are you doin'?!

MINNY

Please don't hurt me! My babies

are in the house.

JOHNNY

Calm down, girl. I'm not here to

get you.

126.

JOHNNY

When I finally confronted Celia

about you, she told me about the

baby. All of them. You saved her

life.

MINNY

I don't know about that.

JOHNNY

Well, I know the day you came to

our house, she started getting

better. And I'm not just talking

about the cookin' either.

MINNY

You knew I was there?

JOHNNY

Fried chicken and okra on the first

night? Y'all should have at least

put corn pone on the table.

MINNY

I couldn't make you eat anymore

corn pone, Mister Johnny.

JOHNNY

Next morning, I snuck back up to

the house, peeked in the window,

and there you were. Given ol'

Oscar a wipe down.

MINNY

So I ain't losing my job?

JOHNNY

You have a job with us for the rest

of your life, if you want it.

JOLENE FRENCH

I heard that Betty character might

be Charlene.

127.

HILLY

It's not Jackson, and that book is

garbage. I bet the whole thing's

made up by some nigra.

LOU ANN TEMPLETON

And, Jolene, didn't your momma

leave Cora to you in her will?

JOLENE

Well, yes...But that's not odd is

it? Happens all the time, right?

LOU ANN TEMPLETON

Did anybody ever figured out who C

and T are?

HILLY

The book is NOT ABOUT JACKSON!

HILLY (CONT'D)

You spilled some, Aibileen.

HILLY (CONT'D)

Get me a new plate. One you

haven't soiled with a dirty cloth.

MINNY

We late? Looks like Bible study

done already started.

AIBILEEN

No. We ain't late.

128.

AIBILEEN

Who we clappin' for?

WOMAN

Honey, we clappin' for you.

REVEREND

Aibileen, this is an important time

for you and our church. We know

you couldn't put your name in here,

so we all signed our own.

REVEREND (CONT'D)

This is for the white lady. Tell

her we love her like family.

AIBILEEN

Churches over two counties signed

our books. All for you and me.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

Doctor King signed it, too. He

readin' our book.

MINNY

We did something. We did something

good.

SKEETER

It's beautiful.

129.

AIBILEEN

What's wrong?

SKEETER

I got a job offer from Harper and

Row...in New York.

AIBILEEN

Congratulations!

MINNY

That real good, Miss Skeeter.

SKEETER

I not taking it. I just wanted to

share it with you both. There's no

one else I can tell.

AIBILEEN

What you mean you not takin' it?

This is what you been dreaming of.

SKEETER

I can't leave you two right when

things are getting bad from a mess

I created. I set out to write a

book to make white people thankful.

But in the end, what we should say

is "sorry."

AIBILEEN

If bad things happen, they ain't

nothing you can do about it. And

if they happen, at least now theys

a reason behind it. A reason we

can wrap our heads around and be

proud of...

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

Now, I don't mean to rub salt in

your wound, but...you ain't got a

good life here in Jackson. Plus,

your momma's getting better-

MINNY

You ain't got nothing left here but

enemies in the Junior League. You

done burned ever bridge there is.

And you ain't never gone get

another man in this town, and ever

body know it. So don't walk your

white butt to New York, RUN IT!

130.

MINNY (CONT'D)

And you listen to me. I'm on take

care a Aibileen, and she gone take

care a me.

AIBILEEN

Go find your life, Miss Skeeter.

SKEETER

What are you doing here?

HILLY

Don't you get an inch closer!

HILLY (CONT'D)

I've contacted my lawyer, Hibbie

Goodman. He's the best libel

attorney in Mississippi. You're in

big trouble, Missy. And you're

going to jail.

SKEETER

You can't prove anything, Hilly.

HILLY

I one-hundred-percent know you

wrote it `cause nobody else in town

is as tacky as you. Those nigras of

yours are in a lifetime of trouble.

SKEETER

Exactly who are you talking about?

You don't know anything.

131.

HILLY

I don't, do I? You tell Aibileen,

the next time she wants to write

about my dear friend Elizabeth...uh-

huh. Remember her? Had you in her

wedding? Let's just say, Aibileen

ought to've been a little bit

smarter before putting in the L-

shaped crack in poor Elizabeth's

dining table. And that nigra,

Minny? Do I have plans for her.

SKEETER

Careful, Hilly. Don't give

yourself away now.

HILLY

That was not me WHO ATE THAT PIE!

SKEETER

I did not invite you here!

HILLY

I've come to tell your mother what

a hippie you've become. She's

gonna be disgusted by you.

SKEETER

You're telling my mother on me?

SKEETER (CONT'D)

You get out of here!

CHARLOTTE

Why, Hilly...It's been such a long

time, Dear. Everything okay, you

two?

HILLY

Missus Phelan, I'm...I'm here to-

CHARLOTTE

Hilly, you're a mess. Are you ill?

HILLY

Well, I...I didn't have time to get

fixed up before-

132.

CHARLOTTE

Darling, no husband wants to come

home and see this.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

And that...that is horrendous.

HILLY

Missus Phelan, I'm here-

CHARLOTTE

You know, Hilly. If I didn't know

any better, I'd say you've been

eating too many...SWEETS?

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

In fact. I'm sure of it. Now GET

OUT OF MY HOUSE...before we all get

one of those on our lip.

CHARLOTTE (O.C.) (CONT'D)

Eugenia?

SKEETER

Yes, Ma'am.

CHARLOTTE (O.C.)

Come in here, please.

SKEETER

Ma'am?

CHARLOTTE

Do you have plans tomorrow? Bible

study? Anything like that?

SKEETER

No, Ma'am.

133.

CHARLOTTE

Good. We're going shopping.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

`Cause no single daughter of mine

is going to New York, representing

the great state of Mississippi,

without a proper cosmopolitan

wardrobe.

SKEETER

What?

CHARLOTTE

I'm very proud of you, Eugenia.

SKEETER

How do you know about New York?

CHARLOTTE

A friend of Constantine's told me.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

Would you do me the honor of

signing my copy?

MINNY

They fired Leroy last night! And

when Leroy ask why, his boss say

Mister Holbrook told him to do it.

Said his nigger wife the reason.

AIBILEEN

Oh, Law!

MINNY

He try to kill me with he bare

hands! He threw the kids in the

yard, lock me in the bathroom, and

say he gone set the house on fire.

134.

AIBILEEN

Where are you now?!

MINNY

The gas station. I climbed out the

window, and we all ran here.

AIBILEEN

I'm on come there now.

MINNY

Wait, Aibileen...I'm pregnant.

AIBILEEN

Minny, now, you listen to me. That

baby gone be fine, and you ain't

never gone lose your job. Mister

Johnny told you that hisself.

They's more book money coming.

Your baby ain't gone know about

gettin' beat. You hear me? You

free, Minny! You are free.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

You hear me?

MINNY

I hear you...

ELIZABETH (O.C.)

Aibileen?

AIBILEEN

Good morning.

HILLY

Aibileen, the silver I lent

Elizabeth last week.

AIBILEEN

It not polished good? Humidity

been fighting me on polishing day.

HILLY

When you returned it, three pieces

were missing out of the felt

wrapper. A fork and two spoons.

135.

AIBILEEN

Lemme...lemme go look in the

kitchen, maybe I left some behind.

HILLY

You know as well as I do that

silver's not in the kitchen.

AIBILEEN

You check in Mae Mobley's bed? She

been putting things-

HILLY

Do you hear her, Elizabeth? She's

trying to blame it on a toddler.

AIBILEEN

I ain't stole no silver.

ELIZABETH

She says she doesn't have them.

HILLY

Then it behooves me to inform you

that you are fired, Aibileen. And

I'll be calling the police. They

know me.

MAE MOBLEY

Aibee, my froat hurts.

AIBILEEN

I go get her some syrup, Miss

Leefolt.

HILLY

Elizabeth can take care of her

child.

ELIZABETH

I'll go get the couch syrup.

HILLY

I won't tolerate liars!

136.

AIBILEEN

I didn't steal no silver.

HILLY

I'm not talking about silver. I'm

talking about those things you

wrote about Elizabeth. Maybe I

can't send you to jail for what you

wrote, but I can send you to jail

for being a thief. And your

friend, Minny? That nigra's got a

nice surprise coming to her.

Johnny Foote listens to what I say.

She's as good as-

AIBILEEN

Woman!...I know something about

you. Don't you forget that.

AIBILEEN (CONT'D)

From what Yule May says, they's a

lot a time to write letters from

jail. Plenty a time to write ever

person in Jackson the truth about

you, and the paper is free.

HILLY

Nobody would believe something you

wrote.

AIBILEEN

I don't know. Already sold a lot a

books.

HILLY

Get out of here!

MAE MOBLEY

Don't go, Aibiee!

AIBILEEN

Baby, you need to get back to bed.

You got a fever.

MAE MOBLEY

Noooo! Don't go, Aibee. Please

don't leave.

AIBILEEN

I gots to, Baby. I am so sorry.

MAE MOBLEY

Why? Are you going to take care of

another little girl?

137.

AIBILEEN

No, Baby, that's not the reason. I

don't want to leave you, but...It's

time for me to retire. You my last

little girl.

MAE MOBLEY

Noooo!

AIBILEEN

Baby Girl, I need you to remember

ever thing I told you. Okay? Do

you remember what I told you?

MAE MOBLEY

To wipe my bottom good?

AIBILEEN

No, Baby. The other. What you

are.

MAE MOBLEY

You is kind. You is smart. You is

important.

AIBILEEN

That's right, Baby Girl.

HILLY

You need to go now, Aibileen!

AIBILEEN

Give my sweet girl a chance.

MAE MOBLEY

Aibeeeee! Don't go!

138.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Mae Mobley was my last baby. In

just thirty minutes, I felt like my

whole life was done. Of the

thirteen maids, seven of us got

fired. Several other maids got

fired who had nothin' to do with

our book. Guess our stories

weren't so unique after all...But,

like Minny, we was all free.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

And we's was a lot freer than Hilly

Holbrook.

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Ever so often, we all get a nice

piece of book money in the mail.

`Manna from heaven' we like to call

it.

CONSTANTINE JEFFERSON

Born December 24th 1883

AIBILEEN (V.O.)

Thousands of our books went out all

over the world. We had got paid to

tell the truth and we just couldn't

believe it...
