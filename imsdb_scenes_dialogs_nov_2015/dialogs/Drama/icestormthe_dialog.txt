CONDUCTOR

Good morning ladies and gentlemen --

PASSENGERS

(mumbling, ad lib)

What ladies?

CONDUCTOR

-- this train originating at New

York's Grand Central Station is

back in service - next stop will be

New Canaan, Connecticut. New

Canaan, Connecticut, next stop!

"THEN YOU'VE TURNED HIM INTO A

VEGETABLE. YOUR OWN SON." "DON'T

YOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO

POWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD

CONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE

DESTROYED THE WQRLD!"

PAUL (V.O.)

In issue number 141 of The

Fantastic Four, published in

November 1973, Reed Richards has to

use his anti-matter weapon on his

own son, who Annihilus has turned

into a human atom bomb. His son is

the result of Richards' coupling

with the earthling Sue Storm, and

the problem is that the cosmic rays

that infused Richards and the rest

of the Fantastic Four on their

aborted moon mission have made

young Franklin a volatile mixture

of matter and anti-matter.

PAUL (V.O.)

And that's what it is to come from

a family, if you analyze it

closely. Each of them is negative

matter for the other ones. And

that's what dying is -- dying is

when your family, which is in fact

your personal negative matter from

which you emerge -- it's when the

family takes you back, thus hurling

you back into negative space...

PAUL (V.O.)

So it's a paradox -- the closer

you're drawn back in, the further

into the void you're thrown.

FRANCIS

Arise and shine, young Hood.

PAUL

I hope you changed the water in

that bong from last night.

FRANCIS

(finishing a hit)

The water, as you call it, is a

special mixture of amaretto and

Ben&Ben blended for just the exact

chemical interaction with the last

of our precious Thai stick.

FRANCIS (CONT'D)

Waste not Master Hood -- that was

$20 for the bag.

PAUL

(gathering books, papers,

almost talking to

himself)

Man, Francis, you are one drug

addled elitist freak, and when the

revolution comes I do not want to

be lined up with you and shot,

'cause you're fucking ripe for

political reeducation, you know,

like in the fields.

FRANCIS

Paul, cancel your mental

appointments, baby. What are you,

like still stoned from last night?

PAUL

(spraying some chloroform

mouth spray)

I gotta get to English class.

TEACHER

Libbets?

LIBBETS

What Dostoyevsky is saying here is

that to be a Christian is to

choose, because you have to choose

of your own choice, but since you

can't choose to be good because

that would be too rational you have

to choose to be bad -- it's

existential.

TEACHER

Thank you Libbets, that's a very

compelling summary, but --

PAUL

Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm

also really a fan, and what you

were saying, you know, have you

ever read The Idiot?

LIBBETS

The Idiot?

PAUL

If you liked Notes from

Underground, you'll love The Idiot.

LIBBETS

(turning to go)

Great, thanks for the tip.

PAUL

(after her)

The Idiot.

PAUL

I'm in love with Libbets Casey.

MARGE

Yeah, well, you've been in love

with like every other girl here, I

was wondering when you'd get around

to Libbets.

PAUL

It's beyond mere physical

attraction.

MARGE

That's good, because I don't think

Libbets is capable of the sex act.

PAUL

Truly? Do speak.

MARGE

My diagnosis is messed in the head.

A poor little rich girl -- I mean

check out the jeans and fur look.

And lend your ears to this

brutality. Like her mom and step

dad and her step-sisters are going

to Switzerland to ski over

Thanksgiving break -- and like they

didn't invite her!

PAUL

How do you know this shit?

MARGE

They did it last year too. It's

like traditional or something.

They've got this humongoid Park Ave

apartment and she just holes up

there with a wad of cash.

(beat)

Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?

PAUL

(pause)

You think Francis is going to beat

me to the punch here?

MARGE

Since he sleeps with every girl you

ever show an interest in, why don't

you just keep your Libbets thing a

secret from him?

PAUL

Good thinking Marge.

PAUL

No more man. I'm about to drop as

it is.

FRANCIS

See ya.

PAUL

Where you going?

FRANCIS

Paul, let me enlighten you about

something.

You and I exist on two opposite

sides of a great existential

divide, that being your pathetic

virginity on the one hand and my

astonishing number of sexual

conquests on the other. I'm off to

get laid. See you.

PAUL

Flame on, asshole.

FRANCIS

And remember, with your erogenous

zones lubricated as such with the

mighty herb, do not attempt

terrestrial contact with members of

the opposite sex -- because you

drone on like a motherfucker when

you're stoned.

LATER:

PAUL

(stoned)

-- because I've been reading

Kerouac and Ginsberg and those guys

were creating beat culture and

traveling and sleeping wherever,

and, of course, with all kinds of

people, but when you read carefully

the various contemporary accounts

of their lives, and, uh, these guys

didn't bathe much, I mean they were

really filthy, with like genital

crabs, lice, exceptionally strong

body odor...

PAUL

How can you do that man?

FRANCIS

Do what?

PAUL

Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's

already getting dark outside, and

you're just getting up.

FRANCIS

(beat)

Um, Libbets Casey.

PAUL

What?

FRANCIS

Aha! I could sense the vibe.

PAUL

What do you mean?

FRANCIS

Am I right or am I right?

PAUL

Shit. You're not planning --

FRANCIS

My man, I speak to you solely as a

comrade in arms offering

unconditional aid. I've been giving

this one a lot of thought, and I

believe that the two of you

together might just reach that

higher ground that --

STUDENT  (O.S.)

Hood, telephone.

PAUL

Don't mess with Libbets. I mean it!

PAUL

Hello?

BEN

Paul?

PAUL

Hi dad.

BEN

Hey guy. Things ok up there? You

all right?

PAUL

I'm fine dad.

BEN

Well good. Just confirming. You'll

be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.

PAUL

Well dad, actually I thought I'd

take the morning train on

Thanksgiving -- got a lot of

studying, papers, you know, lab

experiments --

BEN

Lab experiments? Right smart guy --

Paul, you know your mother's gonna

be disappointed not to see more of

you -- In fact, let me make this

more than a simple request guy, I

think you should...

NIXON

(on TV, from San Clemente

press conference)

Well, with regard to the questions

as to why Americans feel we were

wrong to make the tapes, that is

not particularly surprising. I

think that most Americans do not

like the idea of taping

conversations and, frankly, it is

not something that particularly

appeals to me...

BEN

Hold on for a second.

(turning)

Wendy, you want-to say hi to your

brother?

BEN (CONT'D)

Come on!

WENDY

Charles.

PAUL

Charles. Have you been keeping out

of my shit? Have you refrained from

entering the sacred precincts of my

room?

WENDY

I have not touched your sh--

(looks at father)

Stuff. You watching this?

PAUL

Watching what?

WENDY

Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He

should be shot.

BEN

(overhearing)

Hey, that's the president of the

goddam United States you're talking

about, Wendy!

WENDY

He's a liar!

(still talking more to her

father than into the

phone)

Dean told him on March 21st about

Kalmback and Hunt, all about the

payoffs to the Watergate burglars,

so you tell me where the so-called

"Dean Report" is, but you can't

because it doesn't exist, because

he lied about Haldeman and

Erlichman and the April 17 tape,

that's why! Liar!

BEN

(muttering)

OK, OK, the defense rests.

(to Elena in the kitchen)

Want another?

ELENA (O.S.)

No thank you. We should be off.

BEN

Gotcha.

PAUL

(on the phone)

Hey Charles. Charles, calm down --

I wasn't in on it.

ELENA

Dinner's on the counter. We'll be

at the Williams's -- you know the

number.

(takes the phone from

Wendy)

Paul. Hi. Is there anything you'll

want, any particular kind of food

or snack or anything we can stock

up on?... You're all right? ... OK.

See you next week. I love you.

NIXON

We must recognize that one excess

begets another, and that the

extremes of violence in the 1960s

contributed to the extremes of

Watergate...

BEN

His brother came back --

DOROTHY

From where?

BEN

Vietnam.

DOROTHY

Oh. Are we going to talk about

this, about...?

ELENA

You should hear. It's very sad, he

was --

JUMP CUT:

JIM

It was a benefit for the ACLU or

something, and Harry Reems himself

was there --

DOROTHY

The man with the -- from Deep

Throat?

JIM

The very one -- something about a

first amendment defense fund --

well I believe in it --

DOROTHY

Ted took me to see it.

JANEY

Ted, how romantic.

DOROTHY

I have to say, the movie didn't do

much for me. But being in that

theater, surrounded by all those

horny young college boys and

perverts, there was something in

the air that --

JUMP CUT:

JIM

-- pulls right up to the pump,

jumps out like there's no gas

shortage, oblivious, and by this

point everybody in line's piling

out of their cars ready to kill the

guy, when they notice it's that

Reverend Edwards --

BEN

The Unitarian? The new one?

JIM

Yeah -- claims he pulled off Creek

Road and didn't notice the line

going back Mill Street for half a

mile.

BEN

He's either got his head in the

clouds or up his --

DOROTHY

I hear he's slept with half the

women in his congregation --

TED

Lucky bastard!

BEN

Hell! -- I mean, no problemo there

Mikey. Here, I --

CUT TO:

DOROTHY

(unconvincing)

So fascinating. Do you get free

tickets to the movies, that kind of

thing?

BEN

No, my job is just to analyze the

entertainment stocks and advise our

institutional investors on where to

put their money. It's --

ELENA

Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job

that requires a certain prescience

with regards to entertainment

trends. You were the first to

predict that Billy Jack would be a

hit --

BEN

(with a bit too much

conviction)

And as usual no one believed me...

CUT TO:

JANEY

Please don't.

ELENA

It's not a bother.

JANEY

I insist.

(beat)

Don't touch them.

ELENA

Oh.

JANEY

(realizing she's gone too

far)

It's really quite all right.

ELENA

Of course.

DOROTHY

And to think -- they met at a key

party of all things.

ELENA

A key party?

DOROTHY

You know, it's a California thing.

That scuzzy husband of hers dragged

her kicking and screaming to one

when they were out in L.A. you

know, the men put their car keys in

a bowl, and then at the end of the

evening the women line up and fish

them out and go home with whoever's

keys they've got. Anyhow that's how

she met this Rod person or whatever

his name is and he's left his wife

and she's packing for California.

Irwin is devastated. It's so

ironic.

JANEY

Ironic?

DOROTHY

(caught out)

Well, um, yes. Ironic. His name is

Rod.

ELENA

Thank you Janey.

DOROTHY

It was lovely!

BEN

Hey Jim, next time you've got to

fill me in on whatever it is you're

up to these days.

JIM

Will do.

SANDY

Stupid!

(pause, looking sullenly

at Mike's back)

Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?

MIKEY

(not looking up, but

alarmed)

Who said so?

SANDY

No one.

MIKEY

I don't have a girlfriend.

WENDY

-- he knows that when the March

24th tape -- you know with Dean,

where Dean tells him that there's a

cancer growing on the presidency --

WENDY (CONT'D)

Who? No way. He's like a big

infected whitehead wearing jeans. I

wouldn't --

WENDY (CONT'D)

(whispering)

-- shit, it's my parents.

BEN

You'd think she'd learn how to cook

a chicken, eh? My drumstick was

still frozen when you cut inside

there. I'm probably going to get

whatever that disease -- and Jim,

how that guy ever became a

millionaire --

BEN (CONT'D)

Hmm. I knew she'd still be up.

Watch this --

WENDY (O.S.)

(yelling behind her door)

Dad stop it!

BEN

Get to sleep young lady -- and I

mean it.

WENDY

Fascist!

BEN

If I were a fascist I would have

sent you to one of those Southern

military academies a long time ago.

Now get to bed.

BEN

Hey!

BEN (CONT'D)

(softening)

Hey, kiddo. Sleep well, huh.

WENDY

(without pulling the sheet

down, but nicely)

Good-night dad.

BEN

Good night kiddo.

ELENA

(without opening her eyes)

You're staring at me.

BEN

I wasn't star--

ELENA

I've been thinking, Ben, about

Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd

come with me sometime to meet Dr.

Woolens.

BEN

That shrink -- the one you always

wanted me to see? I thought you

dropped him.

ELENA

I did, but -- somebody should

probably see her, talk to her...

You think she's ok?

BEN

Why shouldn't she be?

BEN (CONT'D)

(pause)

Then again, why should she be? I

mean with us, with our...

ELENA

So maybe you'll come too?

BEN

Oh not again Elena! If we've got

problems, why can't you just come

out and talk about them.

ELENA

It's you Ben who needs to talk.

I've had my say, and I'm waiting to

hear back from you.

BEN

Yeah but Elena, even you don't

believe all that "I'm OK. You're

OK" stuff you keep babbling about --

you say so yourself. I've been all

ears for about ten years now on his

subject, and --

ELENA

-- And you haven't moved out yet.

It's because you're too lazy, Ben.

Too scared or lazy to either deal

with us or simply make a decision --

BEN

Elena.

ELENA

(sighing)

Sleep in the study? Please.

BEN

Good night.

ELENA

Good night.

BEN

But what, exactly, is stagflation,

this mixture of inflation and

stagnation, and how should we in

the securities industry understand

and accommodate it? Well -- and I

hope I'm not out of bounds here -

think of the money supply as a

large male organ, continuously

inflating, and yet, the societal

vaginal cavity simply wants more.

As the vicious circle of higher

returns without real satisfaction

continues, the money-organ may seem

to be in demand, but in fact even

the most inflated capital is

unwanted. This is why I suggest

that while we engage this mawing

abyss for the highest returns, we

at the same time fantasize, so to

speak, of the safe harbor of

capital appreciation.

SHACKLEY

(more or less mumbling)

Brilliant, brilliant.

GEORGE

Hey there Benjie, you're becoming

quite the in-house philosopher.

When do you have time to think up

all that stuff -- Shackley sure

eats it up.

BEN

George, I'm just trying to get a

global view of things -- can't just

look at the small picture.

GEORGE

And speaking of which, you have

those market share charts Mr.

Shackley was asking about?

BEN

Gotcha George, not a problem.

Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start

covering the old filmed

entertainment sector yourself?

GEORGE

Ben you know that's your territory

- and I wouldn't dream to trespass

- you're the expert. Hey, how do

you think Paramount's gonna do with

that Blatty novel, what's it

called? The Exorcist?

BEN

Overpriced bomb, cost over $6

million -- no stars, and no one's

into the horror genre these days

anyway. I'm advising the company

recommend reducing positions there.

It's disaster films that are gonna

stay at the top.

GEORGE

Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a

little early today?

BEN

Got a meeting uptown.

GEORGE

(already moving off)

Right o'.

BEN

Up the organization!

(then, to himself)

Bastard.

HAROLD

(waylaying a passing

waiter)

I'd asked for that double martini

about three hours ago!

WAITER

Coming right up, sir.

HAROLD

So asking me out for lunch -- what

prompted this exceptional event? --

Of course I'm paying.

BEN

We don't have to always go to your

club, dad.

HAROLD

And why are you still calling me

dad? You're forty years old

already, and --

BEN

-- Well what am I supposed to call

you?

HAROLD

That's besides the point.

BEN

I was actually trying to see about

getting a little advice, you know --

HAROLD

Advice? I'm supposed to be getting

the stock tips from you, Ben.

Unless - have you quit your job?

They fired you?

BEN

You know, dah--

BEN (CONT'D)

Actually it's not about work, it's

advice about --

HAROLD

Oh for crying out loud Ben, you

don't mean to tell me that your

marriage is going down the drain

now --

BEN

Well, Elena and I have kind of been

talking, not really talking, but --

HAROLD

-- Your mother, God bless her,

stood by me for forty-two years --

we never once contemplated divorce

- I assume you're talking here

about divorce? The very thought --

BEN

But dad, you guys truly hated each

other, I mean really hated each --

HAROLD

-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?

(back to Ben)

You want advice Ben? If your big

brother were still alive I'd have

him go out into the back yard and

beat some sense into your head.

Look kid, you married that woman

against my advice --

BEN

-- What advice? You never --

HAROLD

That's besides the point. The point

is if I'd had any sense in me I'd

have divorced your mother 40 years

ago, and that's the truth, and here

it is, 1972 --

BEN

-- 73

HAROLD

-- 73, and divorce is as easy as

paying off a traffic ticket, and

for crying out loud, Ben, be a man

and just get it over with. I would

have if I'd had the chance.

BEN

(weakly)

But...

HAROLD

But what?

BEN

But I -- well maybe I love her.

Elena.

HAROLD

Christ Ben! Make up your mind and

eat your lunch.

PHILIP

Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?

ELENA

Yes.

PHILIP

Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards.

You came by and checked out the

congregation a couple of times last

year.

ELENA

Yes, it was -- I ended up --

PHILIP

(smiling)

No need to make excuses --

BETH

(referring to one of the

girls gathered in the

other group)

She said you licked Dave Brewster's

weenie in the third floor bathroom.

WENDY

She's a liar. I wouldn't touch Dave

Brewster's dick if you paid me.

It's probably crawling with v.d.

after he put it in her, which he

did.

MIKEY

(as he returns to the

group, ball in hand)

Did anybody hear that?

WENDY

I gotta go.

PHILIP

It's been a tremendously

transformative year -- maybe a

little controversial of course, but

we're breaking down the old

Unitarian barriers --

ELENA

I suppose my reluctance was the

group aspect of it -- I've never

been much of a joiner, although I

still consider myself a somewhat

religious person --

PHILIP

Well I of course flatter myself

that our church is not exactly what

most people would call organized

religion -- at times it's the

disorganization that's liberating --

and of course I've begun to

minister much more in what one

might call therapeutic

environments, in small groups, and

one on one, couples --

ELENA

(cutting him off)

My daughter. I haven't been on a

bike for years.

(still not really looking

at him)

When was the last time you rode a

bike?

PHILIP

(a bit taken aback by the

abrupt topic change)

They say you never forget.

ELENA

(jarred back to his

presence)

Forget what?

PHILIP

Forget how to ride a bike.

ELENA

No, of course you don't, you're

right.

SANDY

Hey Wendy.

WENDY

Hey Sandy.

SANDY

Mikey was looking for you.

WENDY

Yeah? See ya.

SANDY

Bam.

MIKEY

Want some gum?

WENDY

Sure.

(pulling them out of her

pocket)

Twinkie?

MIKEY

(opens his mouth,

displaying the gum on his

tongue)

I'm chewing.

WENDY

(after a pause)

Did you tell Sandy?

MIKEY

Tell Sandy? What?

MIKEY (CONT'D)

You didn't tell him either, did

you?

JUMP CUT TO:

BEN

We were golfing, and you know,

golfing to me is something I'm

supposed to enjoy, and I was on the

goddam golf team in college, so

it's something one would assume I

do well -- I used to do well -- but

basically these days golfing for me

is like hoeing, or plowing.

BEN (CONT'D)

It's like farming. I am basically

chewing up large tracts of

expensively landscaped scenery with

overpriced sticks, and George Clair

has obviously, in the mere two

years since he joined the firm, he

has obviously been taking secret

lessons with a golf pro, and I

assume the entirety of his

disposable income has been devoted

to humiliating me on the golf

course. And the guy talks -

incessantly -- throughout the

entirety of the miserable 18 holes

- on topics that are the supposed

domain of my department --

JANEY

Ben--

BEN

Yeah?

JANEY

(gently)

You're boring me. I have a husband.

I don't particularly feel the need

for another.

BEN

You have a point there. That's a

very good point. We're having an

affair. Right. An explicitly sexual

relationship. Your needs. My needs.

You're absolutely right.

JANEY

You should probably get dressed.

The boys will be home soon.

BEN

Gotcha.

WENDY

Hi mom.

ELENA

Hi Wendy.

ELENA (CONT'D)

I saw you on your bike today.

WENDY

With Mikey?

ELENA

Who?

WENDY

Nobody.

ELENA

Mikey Williams?

WENDY

We were just riding around.

ELENA

Well, you looked very -- free --

when I saw you.

ELENA (CONT'D)

Weightless almost -- as if I were

seeing my own memories of being a

girl. There was something internal

about it.

WENDY

Mom. Are you ok?

ELENA

Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You

must think I'm ripe to be checked

into Silver Meadows.

WENDY

You're not a psycho!

ELENA

The people at Silver Meadows aren't

psychos.

WENDY

I know. They're rich drug addicts

and celebrities. When I saw James

Taylor there, and --

ELENA

We've been through this Wendy

James Taylor was actually at that

clinic up near Boston.

WENDY

Well, I saw what I saw, and if you

don't want to believe me --

ELENA

Oh Wendy.

WENDY

They need the money for my band

uniform at school.

ELENA

I thought you quit the band - I

never hear you practice anymore.

WENDY

I don't really need to practice. I

just play a few notes, you know, so

I thought maybe I'd stay in.

ELENA

Well, I'm sure your father and I

would love to hear what you're

playing these days. Maybe after

dinner.

BEN

Can't wait to see how it fits in

with all the other instruments.

ELENA

The Halfords have invited us again

this year.

BEN

You want to go?

ELENA

What do you think?

BEN

Well, it is a neighborhood

tradition.

BEN (CONT'D)

I'm, uh, going to bed.

ELENA

So early?

BEN

Rough day. Good night.

ELENA

Is that a new aftershave?

BEN

Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You

like it?

ELENA

Hmm. Good night.

SANDY

Mikey?

MIKEY

Yeah?

SANDY

Geometry?

MIKEY

Sure, anything but this English.

SANDY

Why are you so good at math but not

in English?

MIKEY

I'm not good at math. Just

geometry.

MIKEY (CONT'D)

(drawing out his examples

on a piece of paper)

It's like, you know when they say

"two squared"? And you think it

means 2 times 2, equals 4? But

really they really mean a square. A

square with a side of two. And the

area of the square is four. Like

every time you use the word, like

squared, or cubed, it's really

space, it's not numbers, it's

space.

And it's perfect space, but only in

your head, because you can't draw a

perfect square, like in the

material world, but in your mind,

you can have perfect space.

(pause)

You know?

SANDY

Yeah. But I just need some help

with my homework.

JIM

Hey guys, I'm back.

MIKEY

(honestly confused)

You were gone?

JIM

(a look of

disappointment)

Yeah Mikey. Yep, I was in Houston,

working on some great new ideas

about silicon, which comes from

sand, very conductive. How you guys

doing? How's school?

MIKEY

Uh, I dunno. OK I guess.

JIM

Hmm. Alright!

SANDY

You really didn't notice? Man, he's

been gone for three days.

JANEY

Good trip?

JIM

(as he sits)

You bet.

JANEY

Jesus, Jim!

JIM

(jumping up, which only

creates another wave)

Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to

trade this thing in for a normal

bed.

JANEY

Just be careful.

JIM

(as he begins to unpack)

You notice anything with Mikey

lately? The kid seemed a little out

of it tonight, eh?

JANEY

Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it

since he was born.

JIM

Hell, I guess he takes after me,

huh?

PHILIP

In many ways, the church-bound

tradition of the father, son, and

holy ghost is simply a version of

the parent-child-adult triad within

us all. It's a primitive set of

symbols for our inner psychology.

ELENA

You're saying that Christ is the

child, and --

PHILIP

-- And God the angry parent, and

the Spirit the hope of an

integrated adult self.

ELENA

All well and good -- But tell me

again what is it exactly that you

believe in?

PHILIP

You ask what the point is?

ELENA

That's right.

PHILIP

Self-realization. Ministering to

help people reach their fullest

potential. Would you believe me if

I told you I want you to see

yourself reach your fullest

potential and self-realization?

ELENA

I would say it sounds like you're

trying to get me into bed.

PHILIP

If that's a potential you see

yourself fulfilling... I mean...

(flustered)

My, I sound a bit --

ELENA

I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I

didn't mean to be so rude.

PHILIP

You weren't. You actually, for some

reason, you have the effect on me

of making me feel just a tiny bit

ashamed of myself.

ELENA

But not too ashamed.

PHILIP

(smiling)

Now you are being rude.

ELENA

And you're still trying to get me

into bed.

PHILIP

Ouch.

DOROTHY

Hello you two. Am I barging in on

some kind of religious study group?

Elena, you look marvelous. Will I

see you and Ben at the Halford's?

ELENA

I suppose we'll make an appearance.

DOROTHY

And Reverend Edwards? Did you make

the list?

PHILIP

(laughing)

I believe so Mrs. Franklin.

DOROTHY

With the two of you there it will

be positively a revival! I'm off!

PHILIP

I'm afraid she's something of a

gossip, isn't she?

ELENA

(gathering her things to

go)

I'm afraid people around here

provide her with quite a bit to

gossip about.

(getting up)

Take care.

PHILIP

That I will indeed.

MIKEY

Because of molecules we are

connected to the outside world from

our bodies. Like when you smell

things, because when you smell a

smell it's not really a smell, it's

a part of the object that has come

off of it -- molecules. So when you

smell something bad, it's like in a

way you're eating it. This is why

you should not really smell things,

in the same way that you don't eat

everything in the world around you

- because as a smell, it gets

inside of you. So the next time you

go into the bathroom after someone

else has been there, remember what

kinds of molecules you are in fact

eating.

HAROLD

It's not the taxes I object to.

It's all the fines and penalties.

BEN

Alright dad. But you sold the

house, you didn't tell anyone,

including the IRS, and I'd of

certainly liked to have seen if

there was any old stuff --

HAROLD

It was all junk!

BEN

Oh. Elena wanted to know when we

could expect you on Thanksgiving.

It's just going to be you this

year.

HAROLD

Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate

Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I

have a new nurse. She's a negro,

she weighs three hundred pounds,

and I've decided to leave my entire

estate to her.

BEN

What?

HAROLD

Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as

gullible as ever.

BEN

That was a joke? You don't tell

jokes.

HAROLD

I thought I'd start trying. If you

don't mind. But I am going to

Florida and I do have a new nurse.

JANEY

Need a lift?

ELENA

Thanks again. For the dinner.

JANEY

Thanks for eating it. I don't know

why I even pretend I can cook.

ELENA

I used to know how to cook.

JANEY

It's not like we're too busy.

ELENA

I'm thinking of going back to

school.

JANEY

Social work?

ELENA

How'd you know?

JANEY

Educated guess.

ELENA

I'm that predictable? No, you don't

have to answer that. It's just that

with the kids almost grown --

JANEY

You don't have to apologize. I'm

too much of a cynic. You actually

seem to be trying to figure things

out -- don't mind me.

JANEY

Here you are.

ELENA

(opening her door)

Thanks for the lift. If the bike's

any bother--

JANEY

None at all. I'll leave it in front

of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.

PAUL (V.O.)

To find yourself in the Negative

Zone, as the Fantastic Four often

do, means that all everyday

assumptions are inverted -- even

the invisible girl herself becomes

visible, and so she loses the last

semblance of her power.

"HERE IN THE NEGATIVE ZONE, HIS

POWERS ARE HALVED. WE CAN DO

NOTHING BUT WAIT... AND PRAY" "BUT

WHAT ABOUT FRANKLIN? HE'LL BE

KILLED!"

JANEY

Sandy!

JANEY (CONT'D)

You little idiotic prick, you could

blow yourself fucking sky high with

all this demented crap.

JANEY (CONT'D)

(sighing)

Hey.

(picking up the

firecrackers)

I'll take this stuff.

SANDY

You going to tell dad?

JANEY

Would it matter?

(sees something else lying

on the ground)

And what's that?

SANDY

(sniffling)

You know, it's the whip -- the one

uncle Frank got me from Mexico.

JANEY

It's not packed with explosives, is

it?

SANDY

No!

JANEY

(going into the house)

Play with the whip.

JANEY

Oh. Hi Wendy.

WENDY

Hi Mrs. Williams.

JANEY

Mikey, have you heard the

explosions coming from the

backyard?

(he stares blankly at her)

Do you know what Sandy's been up

to?

MIKEY

(honestly oblivious, as

usual)

I dunno.

JANEY

Don't you kids have homework?

MIKEY AND WENDY

(without looking up, in

unison)

Thanksgiving break.

CUT TO:

WENDY

After you.

SANDY

Well, you can...

WENDY

Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up

out there? Your mom was pretty

p.o.'d.

SANDY

All my model planes.

WENDY

The ones you built?

SANDY

They were old. And they couldn't

fly anyhow. I'm going to get a

radio-controlled airplane at

Christmas, and then I'll stuff it

full of m-80s and then fly it into

Mrs. Burgess's English class and

blow it up.

WENDY

I have to go to the bathroom.

SANDY

Yeah.

WENDY

I'll show you mine if you show me

yours.

SANDY

What do you want?! What do you

want? Get out! Get out of here!

JANEY

(sizing up the situation)

Shit.

JANEY

A person's body is his temple,

Wendy. This body is your first and

last possession. Now as your own

parents have probably told you, in

adolescence our bodies tend to

betray us. That's why, in Samoa and

in other developing nations,

adolescents are sent out into the

woods, unarmed, and they don't come

back until they've learned a thing

or two.

MIKEY

I don't ever want to see you.

WENDY

Then why'd you come after me?

BEN

Elena. I need some help here if

this thing's gonna defrost by

tomorrow.

BEN (CONT'D)

Here.

BEN (CONT'D)

You all right there?

ELENA

Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to

pick up the cranberry sauce?

BEN

Um, yes.

ELENA

Because you like it on your turkey

sandwiches.

BEN

I do. I'm -- are you...?

ELENA

I... I think I am...

BEN

(pause)

You know Elena, I've been thinking--

ELENA

Ben, maybe no talking right now? If

you start talking, you're going to--

CUT TO:

BEN

You crying?

ELENA

I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it

was... you were, but, you know. I

just don't know...

BEN

(gently making light)

Whatever that means Elena -- And

you complain about me not

communicating... I thought it was --

ELENA

No, I didn't mean to sound

negative. It was -- But Ben.

(beat)

What is going to happen with us?

Have you --

BEN

You have to bring this up now?

What? Did I do something here? Is

that it? Is it something I did?

ELENA

I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's

just that we've got to be honest.

Not just with ourselves, but with

the children.

BEN

(pause, sitting up)

Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you

want to accuse me, you've got --

(looks at watch)

Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul.

I almost forgot.

ELENA

You were saying?

BEN

Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this

thing to the Halford's Friday.

ELENA

That shirt?

BEN

What?

ELENA

Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.

WENDY

You have to follow me?

MIKEY

I dunno. I --

BEN

Hey there Mikey, how's business?

MIKEY

(tripping off of his bike)

Business? Uh, I dunno.

BEN

I'm picking up Paul at the station

- want to come?

WENDY

Nah.

BEN

What you been up to?

WENDY

Nothing.

BEN

So how's school treating you?

PAUL

All right.

BEN

Classes?

PAUL

Good.

BEN

Grades?

PAUL

Fine.

BEN

Anyone special? You know...

PAUL

Hnnn.

BEN

Well it's good to see you -- we

miss you around the house and all,

but this St. Peter's, it's top of

the line, eh?

PAUL

Yeah.

BEN

You know Paul, I've been thinking,

maybe this is as good a time as any

to have a little talk, you know,

about -- well --

PAUL

(nervous)

About?

BEN

Well, the whole gamut. Facts of

life and all. Some fatherly advice,

because, I tell you, there's things

happening that you're probably old

enough... well...

(pause)

For example, on the self-abuse

front -- now this is important -

it's not advisable to do it in the

shower -- it wastes water and

electricity and because we all

expect you to be doing it there in

any case -- and, um, not onto the

linen, and not on your sister's

underwear or any clothing belonging

to your mother --

PAUL

Uh, Dad --

BEN

Holy! Well. If you're worried about

anything, just feel free to ask,

and, uh, we can look it up.

PAUL

Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.

BEN

All the more reason for this little

heart to heart... great.

BEN

Um, Paul. On second thought, can

you do me a favor and pretend I

never said any of that.

PAUL

Sure dad.

BEN

Thanks.

PAUL

Hello, Charles.

WENDY

Greetings, Charles.

PAUL

How are the parental units

functioning these days?

WENDY

Dad's like doing his Up With People

routine, mom hasn't been saying

much.

PAUL

I don't know. Dad seems a little

weird.

WENDY

Yeah well wait till mom opens her

mouth.

PAUL

May I operate your telephonic

apparatus?

WENDY

Why don't you use the phone

downstairs?

PAUL

Calling an individual, Charles, in

New York. Confirming a social

outing for Friday night.

WENDY

Can I come?

PAUL

It's a one-on-one kind of date

thing.

WENDY

With who?

PAUL

Her name's Libbets.

WENDY

Libbets? What kind of a name is

Libbets?

ELENA

The turkey in?

BEN

Stuffed and baking.

BEN

Anyone home?

PAUL

I'll be out in a second.

BEN

Sure you will.

BEN

Well, it's great we can all be

together. And this Thanksgiving, no

hysteria, no yelling, especially

with grandpa not here, although we

miss him. So let's do it right and

actually, Wendy, why don't you say

grace. You used to love to say

grace, remember.

WENDY

Dear Lord, thank you for

Thanksgiving, and for letting us

white people kill all the

Indians...

WENDY (CONT'D)

... and steal their tribal lands

and stuff ourselves like pigs

WENDY (CONT'D)

... while children in Africa and

Asia are napalmed and --

BEN

Jesus all right enough!

FADE OUT:

JANEY

Here.

BEN

After the Thanksgiving I had, I

need it. You having one?

JANEY

In a bit.

BEN

You know, I think Elena might

suspect something.

BEN (CONT'D)

(thinking aloud)

Maybe it's all for the better, you

know?

Yesterday, at dinner, well, she

hasn't said anything... has she

acted funny to you, I mean, have

you noticed anything?

JANEY

(almost ironic)

Have I noticed anything? I'm not

married to her Benjamin, you are. I

think you've probably a better

vantage point from which to observe

her.

BEN

Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a

lot lately, and -- No, that's not

it. I guess we've just been on the

verge of saying something, whatever

it is, just saying something to

each other. On the verge.

JANEY

I'll be back.

BEN

Huh?

JANEY

Birth control.

BEN

Right. Gotcha.

BEN (CONT'D)

Janey?

BEN (CONT'D)

(quietly)

Janey?

BEN (CONT'D)

Shit.

BEN

Water bed! Dig it!

JUMP CUT:

MIKEY (O.S.)

See, no one's here. Maybe you want

to go to the basement?

WENDY (O.S.)

Maybe we can just watch some TV.

MIKEY (O.S.)

There's a TV in the basement.

MIKEY

Maybe we can mess around. You know,

only if you want to...

WENDY

I don't know.

MIKEY

Why did you -- with Sandy?

WENDY

I don't know.

MIKEY

You like him? He worships you.

WENDY

Hey, what's this?

WENDY (CONT'D)

Wow!

MIKEY

Wendy!

WENDY

(from behind the mask)

I won't take my pants off. But I'll

touch it. That's as far as it goes.

MIKEY

(muttering)

When worlds collide.

WENDY

Huh?

MIKEY

4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.

BEN

What the hell are you kids doing

down here?

WENDY

What do you think we're doing, dad?

BEN

What do I think? I think you're

probably touching each other. I

think you're touching that reckless

jerk-off, for god's sake, and I

think he's trying to get into your

slacks. I think, at fourteen years

of age, that you're getting ready

to give up your girlhood --

MIKEY

Hey, hang on there, Mr. Hood --

BEN

Don't you direct a single word at

me, Mikey. I don't want to hear it.

I'll be speaking with your parents

about this situation very soon. Bet

your ass on that, son. Young lady?

WENDY

Talking to me, dad?

BEN

Who else would I be talking to? And

take that thing off!

WENDY

(pulling off the mask)

Well, then forget all this stern

dad stuff.

BEN

I'm not interested in your smart

ass remarks now, lady. Let's go.

Right now. You and I can discuss it

on the walk home.

BEN

Look, kiddo, don't worry about it.

I really don't care that much. I'm

just not sure he's good enough,

that's all.

WENDY

Huh?

BEN

I mean, he's not serious, he'll end

up living off Janey and Jim, you

watch.

It's just that you develop a sense

when you get older, if things are

going to work out or if they won't,

and sometimes it's not worth the

mess...

BEN (CONT'D)

Your toes cold?

WENDY

Yeah.

BEN

I'll carry you up the drive.

ELENA (O.S.)

(from the kitchen)

Dinner in ten minutes.

BEN

You go dry off now.

BEN

Never guess where I found her.

BEN (CONT'D)

In the basement over at Janey and

Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not

even a TV on.

And they're on the floor and he's

got his trousers down though thank

goodness she's still dressed. Well,

I really let him have it!

(a nervous laugh)

... and Wendy came home

peacefully... Hey, should I dress

for the Halford's now, or - give me

your -

ELENA

Up to you. I'd like to go early and

leave pretty soon after that.

BEN

I get you loud and clear... hey,

you look nice.

ELENA

So what were you doing in the

Williams' basement anyway?

BEN

Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup.

Jim left it, last time he was over.

It was on the dash of the car. You

were, you know, reading, thought

I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.

ELENA

Oh right. The mustache coffee cup.

The one that was sitting on the

dash.

BEN

Yeah, that one.

ELENA

That one.

PAUL

See you.

BEN

Stay out of trouble.

ELENA

You'll be on the 10:30 train?

PAUL

11:30?

ELENA

Paul --

BEN

Ah let the guy have his fun. What's

the name of this girl with the Park

Avenue address?

PAUL

Libbets. Libbets Casey.

BEN

Libbets? What kind of name is

Libbets?

TV

... and that ends today's highlight

coverage of the Watergate affair.

WENDY

Shoot.

BEN

What's for dessert?

ELENA

See for yourself.

BEN

No advice from the experts, huh?

ELENA

Don't start.

BEN

You think I --

ELENA

I have no idea.

BEN

What's on your mind? Don't --

ELENA

It wouldn't make a pleasant

evening, if that's what you're

after. I don't want to talk about

it. Stupid mustache cup.

BEN

What do you mean?

ELENA

Don't be dim.

BEN

Elena, what are you're talking

about?

ELENA

I'm not surprised.

BEN

Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull

that passive aggressive stuff on me

again --

ELENA

Your unfaithfulness -- that's what

I'm trying to talk about. Your

unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your

dalliance. And you won't do me the

dignity of being up front about it.

BEN

(quieter)

Am I unfaithful? Is that what

you're trying to say?

ELENA

It's a starting place.

BEN

Well, what kind of faithfulness are

you after?

ELENA

If you're going to insult me --

BEN

What else could I be? What else

could I be? We're not living in the

real world here. You're living out

some fantasy land from the past, or

some advice or something from those

psychoanalysts... there are some

hard facts here.

BEN (CONT'D)

It's the law of the land... the

government, the world, those two

guys on the Yankees... And I'm not

having any fun at it, I can tell

you that. I'm not...

ELENA

Oh lord. You think I'm so dense.

And now you want to be seen with

your dense wife at the cocktail

party. You want to wear that

ridiculous shirt which doesn't go

with those pants at all. You want

to wear that, and you want me to

shake hands with your friends and

make conversation and dress up in

an outfit that shows a lot of

cleavage and you're not going to

accord me the respect of talking

honestly about this... You don't

really know what this feels like.

BEN

(whispering)

Sure I do. Do I know what

loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I

know a lot about it, if that's what

you mean.

ELENA

Benjamin. That's supposed to

explain it?

ELENA

We're going to the Halford's. The

number's on the calendar in the

kitchen. We should be home around

11.

WENDY

(eyes still glued to the

TV)

Is it a big party? A big

neighborhood party?

ELENA

I suppose. Why?

WENDY

Just curious. If there's a problem,

I guess I'll just call you there to

interrupt.

ELENA

What sort of problems are you

planning exactly?

WENDY

(still watching the TV)

Oh I thought I'd steal the station

wagon, drive up to a commune. Or

set the house on fire. You know.

ELENA

Just bundle up. It's supposed to

freeze tonight. We'll see you in

the morning.

DOT

Ben, Elena. Wonderful! Wonderful!

So wonderful to see you.

DOT (CONT'D)

Would you care to play? New this

year.

DOT (CONT'D)

Strictly volunteer, of course. You

can put your coats in the library

if you like.

ELENA

Oh, damn. Uh, I've left the --

BEN

You've...

ELENA

In the car.

BEN

Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right

back, Dot.

ELENA

This just isn't the best moment for

this.

BEN

I know, I know. I had no idea --

ELENA

That this was going to be a key

party?

BEN

Yeah, well, if we'd understood we

could have invented some kind of

excuse. A key party -- did you see

how stuffed that bowl was already?

ELENA

Well?

BEN

I think we're here and we don't

have to stay -- we ought simply to

put in an appearance and then we

can head home.

ELENA

Damn it, Ben --

BEN

I'm not staying at this party so we

can go home with someone else's

wife. That's not why we're here,

right? We're simply being neighbors

here, and I think we should do just

that --

ELENA

You're not going to --

BEN

I'm not.

ELENA

You have some marker, that's what I

think, if you want to know the

truth.

You have some marker and you're

going to put it on the house keys

so that Janey can find them and

then when I get back to the house

I'll find the two of you in there

and Wendy'll be able to hear you

and Paul will be back and he'll

hear you and I'll catch you, that's

what I think. She'll be swearing

and banging against the wall and

I'll catch --

BEN

Elena.

BEN (CONT'D)

Elena, it's not what you think.

It's not a big plot. Honestly.

Honestly. I don't know if you want

to go over this now, but it's just

something that comes over me. I

don't feel good about it. I know

I've done what I didn't want to do.

I don't know --

ELENA

Well, I'm really pleased to hear a

confession.

BEN

Elena, you're just getting wound up

to get wound up.

ELENA

Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben.

Thank you. So let's just go to this

fiasco if that's what you want to

do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather

talk to anyone else but you.

ELENA

Oh, Dot!

GEORGE

Benjie!

BEN

Clair, George Clair! What the hell

brings you to New Canaan?

GEORGE

Well, it's the funniest thing. I've

been talking to some investors -- a

little outside venture, you

understand, between you and me --

about a scheme to manufacture a new

Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut

like pieces that can really keep an

item free from trauma during

shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it

turns out the genius behind the

whole project is your neighbor, Jim

Williams. How about that!

BEN

Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a

million coincidence. A real

dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?

GEORGE

Darned right. Look here, Benj,

whaddya make of this sequel to The

Godfather? You think it's gonna

work?

BEN

Don't see how. I think the public's

had its fill of this gangster

stuff. No, trust me -- disaster

pics. And air hockey.

GEORGE

Yeah, good.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Well, gonna make a break for the

hors d'oeuvres guy.

BEN

Yeah, see you bright and early

Monday am.

(beat)

Say, where's the wife?

GEORGE

(winking as he goes)

In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm

a free agent tonight.

JANEY

Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you

are.

BEN

Damn right, but where the hell were

you?

JANEY

(looking around)

What are you talking about?

BEN

(whispering, but too

loudly)

Don't bullshit me around, Janey.

Jesus Christ, I waited around for

more than half an hour, in nothing

but my boxer shorts, and -- and

what's all that about? What the

hell happened?

JANEY

A prior engagement overcame me.

BEN

What?

JANEY

Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have

obligations that precede your...

from before you showed up. One or

two, you know, good-natured

encounters, that doesn't mean

I'm... I'm not just some toy for

you. When I remembered some chores

I wanted to get done before the

party, I just did them, that's all,

because I wanted to do them before

I saw Jimmy.

BEN

Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to

take this. And what do you mean,

Jimmy? I thought you said you and

your husband --

JANEY

How you take it isn't all that

interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm

sorry --

BEN

I just can't believe you could be

so --

GORMAN

(lighting up a joint)

Welcome to the Monkey House has

been a seminal influence on me --

hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This

stuff will make some sense out of

those larger questions.

BEN

(waving it away)

Thanks for the advice Dave.

BEN (CONT'D)

Uh, well, what the hey...

BEN (CONT'D)

(coughing)

Good shit.

GORMAN

Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I

had it in my chamber for a while. I

was smoking this other --

BEN

It's what?

GORMAN

Don't fret, Benjie, it's --

BEN

Darn it, Dave.

JACK MOELLERING

Take California. They've got their

own airline in-state that's not

subject to the fare controls.

Compare Sacramento to L.A. on the

controlled airlines and you'll see

what Friedman is saying -- supply

and demand, less restriction.

CONDUCTOR

Approaching our final stop, Grand

Central Station.

PAUL

Libbets Casey, please.

DOORMAN

Your name?

PAUL

Paul Hood.

DOORMAN

(a smirk)

Elevator on the right. Eighth floor

-- she's waiting for you.

LIBBETS (O.S.)

(from the other side of

the door)

Open it Paul!

LIBBETS

Excellent. We were waiting!

PAUL

(under his breath)

We?

FRANCIS

(lifting the book up)

You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon,

our leader, all ye need know about

the travails of life. Check out the

Checkers speech stuff.

PAUL

(all hope drained from

him)

Francis. You gonna leave the seeds

in there? In the binding like that?

FRANCIS

All will be revealed, baby.

FRANCIS (CONT'D)

Awesome sleet and rain.

LIBBETS

Major.

FRANCIS

Howdy there. You, young knight. Can

you check on the mead? Can you

sally forth and secure us some more

mead?

PAUL

Huh?

FRANCIS

(nasal voice,

impersonating a TV

character)

Moisture! Moisture!

LIBBETS

(pointing)

Beer. In the pantry.

LIBBETS

Frankie opens them with his teeth.

PAUL

(handing him a beer)

Hey, it's a sellable skill.

FRANCIS

Hell on the fillings.

FRANCIS

Everything's gonna freeze, the big

freeze.

LIBBETS

Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home

okay?

WENDY

Ouch!

WENDY

Stupid.

WENDY

Hood residence.

MIKEY

You're parents at that party?

INTERCUT:

WENDY

Yeah. Yours?

MIKEY

You get in trouble?

WENDY

Maybe. Can't really tell yet.

MIKEY

I'm sorry if I got you into

trouble. Maybe we don't have to,

you know... unless you really want

to.

WENDY

Yeah.

MIKE

I'm going to Silver Meadow, check

out the ice storm... You wanna

come.

WENDY

Maybe.

MIKE

Yeah. OK.

SANDY

Where you going?

MIKEY

Out.

SANDY

It's freezing.

MIKEY

(pausing)

Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that

means the molecules are not moving.

So when you breathe, there's

nothing in the air, you know, to

breathe in to your body. The

molecules have stopped. So it's

clean.

ELENA

Reverend Edwards.

PHILIP

Perhaps you might find it in your

heart to call me Philip?

ELENA

You're here... I'm a bit surprised.

PHILIP

Sometimes the shepherd needs the

company of the sheep.

ELENA

I'm going to try hard not to

understand the implications of that

simile.

PHILIP

Forgive me.

TED FRANKLIN

(passing by)

I hope those weren't my keys.

PAUL

Eureka.

PAUL

Valium. Seconal. Uh,

(can't quite pronounce

this one)

Par-er-goric?

(a beat, looking into the

mirror for effect)

Francis Chamberlain Davenport the

Fourth -- tonight you sleep the

sleep of the just.

PAUL

And whence has yon virginal maiden

absconded?

FRANCIS

Like into one of the other 20 or so

bathrooms they've got in this

place.

PAUL

Check it out. Not for the faint of

heart.

FRANCIS

Pharmaceutical! You are a god.

PAUL (CONT'D)

(picking up beer, trying

to hurry before Libbets

returns)

One for you and one for me.

LIBBETS

(in the doorway)

No candy for me?

FRANCIS

Groovy.

(to Paul)

Young master of the revels, a treat

for our hostess?

PAUL

Well, uh, I don't, it's really --

LIBBETS

What is it?

FRANCIS

Come on Paulie, share the wealth.

You copped 'em from her mom's stash

anyway.

LIBBETS

Let's see!

PAUL

(hand in pocket)

Libbets, you really shouldn't mix

and match, you know with the beer.

I'll put 'em back.

LIBBETS

Oh far out, Paulie. Hey look, these

expired like five months ago. You

think they're better aged?

PAUL

Maybe you should have just a half.

LIBBETS

Thanks for the advice dad.

BOLAND

Benjie, feeling no pain.

BEN

As the Indian saying goes, pain is

merely an opinion.

BOLAND

(nodding across the room)

Hey -- check it out. Maria Conrad's

brought her son.

(walking off)

I wish some of the gang had brought

their daughters!

NEIL

As Werner says, there is nothing to

get. That's It. When you get that

there's nothing to get. That's the

training, when you ask yourself,

the question, "What is is?"

JANEY

Wait, this is the training, where

they don't let you go to the

bathroom?

NEIL

That was the hardest part. But I

did it. And you get into some far

out shit.

FRANCIS

The foot... the foot... toeclipper

man...

PAUL

I guess he's just real exhausted

from, you know, tests and stuff.

LIBBETS

Yeah.

PAUL

You know Libbets, I really feel,

you know, like a real connection to

you --

LIBBETS

Yeah but you don't even know me

really.

PAUL

Sure I do, you know, like your

aura. That you give off.

LIBBETS

My what?

PAUL

It's like very positive, and I feel

a real special feeling, because you

really --

LIBBETS

And I have a special feeling too,

because I do. It's special.

PAUL

You do? I'm glad. Because I feel

for you --

LIBBETS

And I have a feeling for you too,

because you're just like -- I feel

for you like you're -- you're just

like --

PAUL AND LIBBETS

(simultaneously)

-- like a brother.

PAUL

Yeah, you're not alone with that

line.

LIBBETS

I do.

PAUL

Right. Cool. So, how about we take

a bath together?

LIBBETS

(consciousness fading

fast)

Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like

a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm

so wasted.

DOT

OK everyone. We have a little

business to attend to now. So

everyone who'd like to stay, please

gather in the living room.

BEN

(walking up to Elena)

Ready to go?

ELENA

We're not going anywhere.

INTERCUT:

WENDY

Hood residence.

PAUL

(whispering)

Charles, what time is it?

WENDY

Is this Charles?

PAUL

What time is it?

WENDY

Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?

PAUL

I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral

dilemma. And I was wondering,

because I know you're a very moral

person, and --

WENDY

And?

PAUL

Shit. I can't really talk about it.

I guess I better get to the train.

WENDY

Right.

PAUL

What are you doing at home on a

Friday night?

WENDY

I have plans.

DOT

Well, what shall the order be,

alphabetical? In order of

appearance?

PIERCE SAWYER

Golf handicap! Lowest handicap does

the honors.

DOT

Golf handicap? Ladies, isn't it up

to you?

MARIA CONRAD

Oh I'll go first, damn it. Let's

just line up and get it over with.

MARIE EARLE

Good luck!

JUMP CUT TO:

JUMP CUT TO:

JUMP CUT TO:

MRS. GADD

Oh, my own husband. Isn't that

against the rules?

DOT

Try again?

MRS. GADD

(relieved)

Oh, I think not.

DOT

Getting down to the wire!

THE GROUP

(ad lib)

Hey hey Ben, hang on there a sec.

BEN

Sorry... maybe I should... the

bathroom?

DOT

Right down the hall, Ben.

BEN

(muttering)

Sorry, I'm sorry. Uh, I'll be back.

ROB HALFORD

(taking Sari's arm)

Actually, we didn't put our keys in

at all. But you won't spread it

around? It's my party, and Dot

isn't... hey, we're just going to

slip upstairs for a while. You

folks like a cup of coffee or

something before we go?

ELENA

Rob, we'll fix it for ourselves.

You two go and get acquainted.

We'll let ourselves out the front

door.

JIM

Well, I have to say I don't have

much faith that my car keys are

still in that bowl. Doesn't seem

entirely safe, leaving your car

keys around?

ELENA

Let me.

JIM

Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think

so. It's been kind of a

discouraging evening.

ELENA

You couldn't have hoped for much

better when you came up the walk.

JIM

Somehow it was different in my

imagination when I thought about

it. Actually, I didn't think about

it at all, really.

JIM

You want coffee or something?

ELENA

Well, maybe they have one of those

filter jobs in the kitchen --

JIM

Look, Elena, the fact that we're

neighbors... you know, close

friends, well it sort of makes this

a little strange, don't you think?

ELENA

My husband is probably passed out

in the bathroom, or at least he

wishes he were. I've been married

to him for 17 years and I don't

have any intention of going in

there to get him... so what I'm

proposing is that since your wife

has gone off with a boy, and since

you are standing here alone, I'm

proposing that you and I do what

makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some

time. That's all.

ELENA

Now don't make me feel as if I'm

being too forward, OK? If you don't

--

JIM

What the hey. Let's go for a drive.

ELENA

Okay. Shall we clean up around here

first? Do you think it's all right--

JIM

Nah, that wasn't in the contract.

JIM

We're going to have to defrost this

thing for a while.

ELENA

Do these seats go back?

JIM

That was awful, really awful. I'm

so sorry, Elena.

JIM

Things are really rotten at home.

You wouldn't believe how rotten.

Janey's sick. She's unstable, I

guess... it's not the right time to

tell you... but that's it -- it's

like I can't make her happy, the

boys can't make her happy, she just

doesn't --

ELENA

Jim, maybe we should just go. I've

got to look in on the kids. Paul is

supposed to be coming back in from

the city.

JIM

Jesus, let me make it up to you --

I can do better than that, honestly

--

ELENA

Well, we can talk about it.

JIM

That's fine. I wouldn't expect you

to see it any other way.

ELENA

Maybe you just need -- look, can

you wait here a sec, I need to tidy

up -- just a minute, I'll be right

back. You'll wait?

JIM

Of course.

BEN

Elena.

ELENA

Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe

you should sleep this one off on

the couch here?

BEN

I'll drive you --

ELENA

Ben.

ELENA (CONT'D)

You're in no condition to drive.

We'll talk in the morning, OK?

ELENA (CONT'D)

You'll get some sleep on the couch

out there?

BEN

(looking up at her, with

gratitude)

Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in

the morning?

ELENA

We'll talk in the morning.

WENDY

Anyone home? Hello.

SANDY

Wendy.

WENDY

Sandy, you scared the shit out of

me.

SANDY

What are you doing?

WENDY

Just thought I'd stop by.

SANDY

Mike's out -- I think he went to

Silver Meadow to see if you were

hanging around there.

WENDY

Yeah.

SANDY

(pause)

Are you his girlfriend?

WENDY

No.

JIM

You okay?

ELENA

Yeah. You?

JIM

Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from

here.

PAUL

Oh shit!

PAUL (CONT'D)

Oh shit oh shit.

PAUL

Oh shit oh shit. C'mon!

SANDY

Check this out. He's supposed to

talk all kinds of stuff, but he's

like malfunctioned.

G.I. JOE

Mayday! Mayday! Get this message

back to base!

SANDY

Same thing. Again and again.

G.I. JOE

Mayday! Mayday! Get this message

back to base!

SANDY

It's gonna get a lot colder

tonight, I predict. Probably a

blackout. Do you have candles in

your house?

I know where the candles are, and I

have my own flashlight. Over there.

Also, I know where every emergency

exit is on this floor.

SANDY

This knot's called a bowline.

G.I. JOE

Mayday! Mayday!

SANDY

Let's hang him.

WENDY

He's dead.

SANDY

If it wasn't raining we could take

him outside and blow him up.

WENDY

He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get

all mangled or twisted.

WENDY

Well.

(noticing his lack of

anatomy)

It looks like someone got to his

private parts before us.

SANDY

Communist Viet Cong.

WENDY

They left it in the jungle.

WENDY

Can I get into your bed?

(pause)

With you?

SANDY

We -- we have to go to the guest

room. We can't stay in here. What

if Mikey? My parents?

WENDY

Don't worry about them. They're at

that party, getting drunk and

falling all over each other and

making jokes about McGovern and

stuff.

SANDY

It's just -- it's just --

WENDY

Want a drink?

SANDY

Vodka?

WENDY

You never tasted the stuff?

WENDY

Try again.

SANDY

It feels warm.

WENDY

One more shot?

SANDY

Okay.

WENDY

Under the covers.

WENDY

(feeling her way)

Get 'em off.

WENDY

Have you ever had a nocturnal

emission?

SANDY

Huh?

WENDY

That's the name for when you wake

up and find this little pool of

sticky stuff, like after a sexy

dream.

WENDY

They didn't tell you this stuff

yet? What planet do you live on?

SANDY

I love you.

WENDY

That's nice. Are you drunk?

SANDY

I don't know. How do I know?

WENDY

I don't know either. You spin

around, when you lie down.

SANDY (CONT'D)

I don't think I'm spinning.

MIKEY

Oh shit.

JIM

You want to come in, get a cup of

coffee -- warm up? I can either

walk you home, or you could crash

in the guest room.

ELENA

Sure. Maybe coffee.

JIM

Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --

JIM

Oh well. Why don't you put on some

dry socks -- and we've got some

rain boots in the guest closet back

there. Last room upstairs -- back

of the hall.

ELENA

(heartbroken, softly)

Get dressed.

ELENA

You should let him sleep.

WENDY

Where's dad?

"DON'T YOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO

POWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD

CONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE

DESTROYED THE WORLD!"

CONDUCTOR

Good morning ladies and gentlemen --

WENDY

I don't like coffee.

ELENA

It'll warm you up.

SANDY

Dad?

ELENA

Ben?

BEN

Jim -- he was just up --  in Silver

Lane -- I think maybe -- a power

line --

BEN

Do you think? Maybe we should call

someone --

ELENA

The phone's out.

BEN (CONT'D)

Yeah. Well, we can just --

ELENA

Ben, I don't think he wants us

here.

WENDY

Wait, I --

ELENA

Oh you know, for a minute I thought

it was --

BEN

Paul? Yeah. You think --

WENDY

He's probably been waiting all

night at the station.

BEN

C'mon.

BEN

There's something -- your mother

and I -- have to tell you two --

ELENA

(softly)

Ben.

ELENA (CONT'D)

(her hand still not yet

touching him)

Ben.

THE END
