SHOOTING DRAFT

1949

MAN

Burden! Jack Burden! The boss wants

to see you.

MADISON

Hey, Jack, ever hear of a fellow

called Willie Stark?

JACK

No. Who'd he shoot?

MADISON

Oh, county... uh... treasurer, or

something like that.

JACK

What's so special about him?

MADISON

They say he's an honest man. What I

want you to do is to hop into your

car...

JACK

Why, you promised me a vacation.

MADISON

Well, that can wait.

JACK

Yeah... but there's a... a girl I

know.

MADISON

Oh... Well, she can wait too.

JACK

The question is... can I?

MADISON

The answer is... get up there.

JACK

Right.

(starts to go)

Oh... uh... what did you say his

name was?

MADISON

Who?

JACK

The fellow's name.

MADISON

Oh, the... uh... Stark... Willie

Stark.

JACK

(as he leaves)

Willie Stark...

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

(voice over)

I found him in Kanoma City. A typical,

hot, dusty, backwoods county seat.

WILLIE

...to lie to them in order to line

their own dirty pockets with the

taxpayers' money. When have the

citizens of Kanoma County ever

witnessed a campaign like this? Why

is the opposition so anxious to defeat

me? Why have they used every dirty

method known to make sure I'm not

elected county treasurer? Well, I'll

tell you why...

WILLIE

...Because they're afraid of the

truth... and the truth is this.

They're trying to steal your money.

Yeah, I said steal. The county

commissioners rejected the bid on

the schoolhouse. Why? Well, they'll

tell you their reason is the job

will be done better. The county

commissioners would have you believe

that they're interested in public

welfare. They're interested in

welfare, sure. But it's their own.

Let's look at the reason in the light

of the facts and the figures. That

brick factory is owned by one of the

commissioners. That same brick factory

uses convict labor.

SHERIFF

Sorry, Willie, you'll have to move

on.

WILLIE

Why?

SHERIFF

City Ordinance Number One-Oh-Five:

more than five people congregating

is disturbing the peace.

WILLIE

(ignores him)

If you folks'll be so kind as to

read these handbills, my boy will

pass them out among you.

SHERIFF

There's an ordinance against that

too.

WILLIE

(his face grim)

Pass 'em out, Tom.

WILLIE

Let him alone!

SHERIFF

(to deputy)

Get that camera! Willie, you're under

arrest.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

Where can I find Tiny Duffy?

PILLSBURY

Right over there, mister.

JACK

Uh, they told me I could get my camera

back here.

DUFFY

Who told you that?

JACK

People. Can I?

DUFFY

You the reporter that's been snoopin'

around town?

JACK

Are you Tiny Duffy?

DUFFY

What paper?

JACK

Chronicle.

DUFFY

You sure come a long way to stick

your nose into other people's

business.

JACK

That's true... Only my boss on the

paper can't see it that way.

DUFFY

It ain't any of his business either.

JACK

Whose business is it?

PILLSBURY

Them as is tendin' to it. County

commissioners that the voters of

Kanoma County elected to tend to

their business and not take no buttin'

in from nobody.

JACK

You a commissioner?

PILLSBURY

Yeah. Name's Pillsbury. Dolph

Pillsbury.

2ND COMMISSIONER

Me too. I'm a commissioner too.

JACK

Who isn't a commissioner?

DUFFY

He's the head man.

JACK

(to Pillsbury)

Then you're in a position to know

where --

DUFFY

He's in a position to know nothin'.

And to say nothin'.

JACK

I thought you said he was head man?

DUFFY

(smiling)

He uses my head.

PILLSBURY

(laughing loudly)

Oh, Tiny, you're a card... Ain't he

a card? Yeah, he's a card... Now,

who thought up those city ordinances

about arresting someone for making a

speech?

DUFFY

Who's arrested? Nobody's been

arrested.

(looks toward the

door)

Hi, Willie.

PILLSBURY

Hi, Willie.

DUFFY

(to Sheriff)

Did you apologize to Willie?

SHERIFF

(mumbles)

Yeah, I apologized to Willie.

DUFFY

Did you give him his handbills back?

SHERIFF

Yeah, I gave 'em back.

DUFFY

Give him back his flag and his bag

and...

(points to Jack)

give this man his camera.

WILLIE

I'm going to be on that same street

corner tomorrow, Mr. Duffy.

DUFFY

You go right ahead, Willie. We all

believe in free speech. We got to...

it's in the Constitution.

WILLIE

My boy is out distributing those

handbills now.

DUFFY

It's a free country, Willie. If you

can convince the people to vote for

you... you go right ahead.

WILLIE

What did you want to see me about,

Mr. Duffy?

DUFFY

I wanted you to meet a fella came

all the way up from the state capital

to meet you. A reporter. Wants to

write you up... maybe put your picture

in the paper.

WILLIE

(turns to Jack)

I'm happy to know you, sir.

JACK

Burden's my name... Jack Burden. Can

we go somewhere where we can talk?

DUFFY

Now that ain't polite. Don't you

want to hear both sides of the story?

JACK

I know your side.

(finds the plate

missing)

What happened to the plate your men

took from my camera?

DUFFY

Must have dropped out. Oh, come on,

fellas, let's relax. It's a hot day...

Hey, Sugar Boy...

SUGAR BOY

Yeah?

DUFFY

Bring some cold beer for the boys.

WILLIE

None for me, thank you kindly.

PILLSBURY

Now you know Willie don't drink,

Tiny. His wife don't favor drinking.

And Willie's the teacher's pet, ain't

you, Willie?

WILLIE

I'll have some orange pop if you

don't mind.

DUFFY

Orange pop! All right, Sugar Boy.

Bring him some orange pop.

SUGAR BOY

(stutters)

Th-th-the p-p-pop's s-s-sold out.

DUFFY

Did you hear that, boys? The p-p-

pop's s-s-sold out.

PILLSBURY

Now ain't he a card?

WILLIE

(his face hard)

He stutters, Mr. Duffy, but you...

you don't say anything.

(to Jack)

Let's go, mister.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

(as they go up the

steps)

This is my wife, Lucy, Mr. Burden.

JACK AND LUCY

How do you do?

WILLIE

That's my pa.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

Now we'll talk.

JACK

You've been talking for a long time,

Mr. Stark.

PAPPY

Willie's got a lot to say.

LUCY

You sleepy, Pappy? You want to have

a nap?

PAPPY

No, I want to hear it.

LUCY

I'm worried about Tom. It's getting

dark. He should have been home.

WILLIE

He's a strong boy. Don't worry about

him. He can take care of himself.

JACK

How old is the boy?

WILLIE

Fifteen.

JACK

How long have you been married?

WILLIE

Nine years.

LUCY

(laughs)

He was a neighbor's boy. They were

poor folks. Both died. I couldn't

have any children, so... He's a good

boy.

WILLIE

Oh, he's the best. I couldn't love

him any more if he was my own flesh

and blood.

JACK

(to Lucy)

And now you, Mrs. Stark?

LUCY

Oh, there isn't very much to tell

about me.

JACK

How did you meet?

LUCY

I was teaching school and one day a

pupil walked in. It was Willie. I

couldn't have a grown man in the

class and Willie wanted to learn so

badly... so I married him.

JACK

Is that the only reason?

LUCY

(pressing Willie's

arm)

Except that I loved him.

WILLIE

Get the coffee, Lucy.

JACK

When did they fire you, Mrs. Stark?

LUCY

(as she serves the

coffee)

A couple of weeks ago. I'd been

teaching for a long time and nobody

ever said I wasn't all right. But I

don't care. I don't want to teach in

a schoolhouse that they built just

so somebody can steal some money.

And Willie doesn't want to be

Treasurer, either, if he has to

associate with those dishonest people.

WILLIE

(glumly)

I'm going to run. They can't keep me

from running.

JACK

If you don't mind the truth, Mr.

Stark, you haven't much of a chance.

WILLIE

I'm going to run. They're not going

to kick me around like I was dirt.

LUCY

I don't care if Willie loses... just

so he gets the truth to the people.

Isn't that true, Willie?

LUCY

Isn't it, Willie?

WILLIE

Hmmm?... Yeah, yeah, sure, that's

right.

LUCY

Well, if you lose you can give a

little more time to studying your

law books.

JACK

Oh, you studying law too?

WILLIE

By myself, at night.

PAPPY

Willie's a smart boy.

WILLIE

If I ever find the time I'm going to

take a course at the university.

LUCY

What happened, Tommy boy? What's the

matter?

TOM

(head down, muttering)

I gave out the handbills, Pa.

WILLIE

Speak up. Speak up.

LUCY

Let him tell it his own way. Go on,

Tommy.

TOM

This time they were waiting for me.

They took them away from me. Threw

them in the dirt and beat me up. I

brought some of them back.

WILLIE

(pats him on the back)

Good boy. Have you eaten yet, Tom?

LUCY

Let him wash up first.

WILLIE

I'm going to run... and you're not

going to stop me. I'm gonna run even

if I don't get a single vote.

FADE OUT

JACK

Here you are... the last of the Willie

Stark articles. Now can I go?

MADISON

Yes. You've earned your vacation.

You've been writing these like you

really mean them.

JACK

I do.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

(voice over)

I hadn't been home in a long time.

Only a hundred and thirty miles from

Kanoma City. It was separated from

the mainland by a body of water. For

the first time I wondered if it wasn't

separated by more than that.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

Hello, Mother.

MRS. BURDEN

Floyd, Jack's home. Oh, he looks

fine... doesn't he look fine?

(to Jack, coquettishly)

How do I look, Jackie boy?

JACK

You look beautiful, Mother.

MRS. BURDEN

I've got so many things planned for

you... parties and... it'll be just

like old times. But first, let's

have a drink.

MCEVOY

Can't that wait until this evening?

MRS. BURDEN

Floyd... honey... my son's home.

MCEVOY

How long do you plan on staying?

JACK

(coldly)

Two or three weeks. If that's all

right with you.

MRS. BURDEN

I'm sure your father would be --

JACK

Stepfather, Mother.

MRS. BURDEN

(reproachfully)

Now, Jackie... here we all are. Floyd,

Jackie, myself.

(raises her glass for

a toast)

To the best time we've ever had

together.

JACK

Yes, Mother.

JACK

Excuse me... I...

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

Dr. Stanton, I presume.

STANTON

(laughing)

Is my shingle showing?

JUDGE

Good to see you, boy. Very good.

JACK

Good to see you, Judge. How have you

been? What have you been doing?

JUDGE

Oh, just sitting here... waiting for

all of you to come home. You know,

when a man starts to get old his

eyes stray and play funny tricks on

him. As I watched you in that boat I

thought sure I saw a boy of twelve

with a fishing rod in his hands. And

I was sure the first thing he'd say

would be...

JACK

Do you mind if I kiss your niece,

sir?

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MRS. BURDEN

To all the good times we've had

together at Burden's Landing. And

especially to this one. Because my

son's home.

JACK

Thank you, Mother. Thank you very

much.

MRS. BURDEN

Monty, Anne and I have been discussing

Jack's career. What do you think he

ought to go in for? Shall he be a

lawyer, doctor...

ANNE

We were just discussing whether you

should...

JACK

(to his mother)

I like what I'm doing, Mother.

MCEVOY

You do very well at it. I read your

articles about this fellow... Willie

Stark. Very convincing... Too

convincing for my tastes.

JACK

A lot of people like them.

MCEVOY

A lot of people are fools. Articles

like that shouldn't be permitted.

They only tend to incite people.

JACK

What are you afraid of?

STANTON

I thought they were very good. I was

proud of you, Jack. I was particularly

interested in Stark's ideas on health

and medicine. You know the conditions

at the hospital I work in. They're

intolerable. I'd like to meet this

Willie Stark. He sounds like an honest

man.

MCEVOY

Honest man? This state is full of

these log-cabin Abe Lincolns with

price tags on them. The louder he

yells the higher his price.

JACK

You think you can buy anything, don't

you?

MCEVOY

Yes, don't you?

MCEVOY

What do you think, Judge?

JUDGE

I think this state could stand a few

changes.

MCEVOY

(his face white)

Well, I'll tell you what I think --

ANNE

(quickly)

Oh, please... let's not talk politics.

MRS. BURDEN

Anne is right. I absolutely forbid

any more of it. I know what we need,

we need another toast.

(to the Judge)

You propose it, Monty... you're so

good at it.

JUDGE

To the young people... to Anne, to

Jack, to Adam... To what lies before

them. To the world they'll make...

in spite of the mistakes we've made.

MCEVOY

(rising)

The mistakes you've made, not me.

You're all still pretty high and

mighty, aren't you? You all think

this state needs a change. You don't

like the way it's run. Well, who's

going to run it? Willie Stark? The

Judge?

(to Jack)

You? You can be bought too. As a

matter of fact you have been. And

with my money.

MCEVOY

(slowly)

That's a waste of good liquor.

(looks at Mrs. Burden)

Your mother wouldn't approve.

MRS. BURDEN

Jack...

MRS. BURDEN

Jack... you go back in and apologize.

JACK

Apologize? I'd rather die.

MRS. BURDEN

I've got to live with him.

JACK

Well, I don't. Neither do you. You

don't love him, Mother. You never

did.

MRS. BURDEN

Son, don't spoil anything now... He

can help you.

JACK

I can get along without him. You

need this house. And the parties.

And the cars and the clothes and the

lies. I don't. It's the truth, Mother,

face it. For once in your life, face

it.

MRS. BURDEN

Anne, please... please make him

understand.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

Anne, Burden's Landing is a place on

the moon. It isn't real. It doesn't

exist. It's me pretending I live on

what I earn. It's my mother trying

to keep herself young, and drinking

herself old doing it. It's you and

Adam living in this house as though

your father were still alive. It's

an old man like the Judge dreaming

of the past... Anne, come away with

me.

ANNE

And do what?

JACK

(rises impatiently)

And live in a shack and eat red beans.

Anne, what do you want me to do?

ANNE

Oh, Jack, Jack, you haven't been

sure. You've gone from one thing to

the other... a year at law school,

and now this job as a reporter...

JACK

Are you afraid I can't make a living?

ANNE

Oh, no, Jack, it isn't that. I don't

care about the money. It... it's

just that I... I want you to be

something.

JACK

What is it you want me to be?

ANNE

I don't know. It's just that I want

you to be... to do... something

important.

JACK

Like your father. All right. I'll

run for governor.

(pause)

Anne, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said

that.

ANNE

All right, Jack. I'll go away with

you. I'll do anything you want me to

do.

JACK

Anne, I've wanted you to say that

more than anything in the world, and

now that you've said it... Anne, I

guess you were right. I'm not sure

of anything, including myself. I'm

not sure I could live up to the...

(looks again at the

portrait)

Anne, wait for me. Please wait for

me.

ANNE

I'll wait for you.

DISSOLVE TO:

MADISON

Hello, Jack. Cut your vacation short,

didn't you?

JACK

Yeah.

MADISON

By the way, Jack, the fellow you

wrote the articles about... uh...

Stark.

JACK

Yeah?

MADISON

He lost.

JACK

Well, I guess that's the end of Willie

Stark.

FADE OUT

WILLIE

...Measure of the damages is caused

by...

LUCY

(prompting)

A breach...

WILLIE

A breach...

LUCY

Of an agreement...

WILLIE

Of an agreement...

LUCY

To sell personal property...

WILLIE

To sell...

(slams the book shut)

Oh, two years of this.

LUCY

(leaning over to him)

Oh, go on, Willie, go on.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

Willie Stark... Bachelor of Law...

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

If you'll just let me take your

case...

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

Really, I'll wait for my fee. Just

as long as you want me to.

DISSOLVE TO:

LUCY'S VOICE

Go on, Willie, go on.

WILLIE'S VOICE

They're not going to kick me around

like I was dirt.

LUCY'S VOICE

If you lose you can give a little

more time studying your law books.

WILLIE'S VOICE

I'm going to be on that same street

corner tomorrow, Mr. Duffy!

DUFFY'S VOICE

By all means. Free speech, free

country, Willie.

WILLIE'S VOICE

That brick factory is owned by a

brother-in-law of one of the

commissioners. The county

commissioners rejected the low bid

on the schoolhouse.

DISSOLVE TO:

TEACHER

All right, children, this is a fire

drill.

TEACHER

Remember now, walk quietly.

DISSOLVE TO:

MAN

Oh, Lord, I'm punished for voting

against an honest man.

VOICES OF THE MOURNERS

God bless you, Willie. If we had

only listened to you, Willie. You

were right, Willie. Let me shake

your hand, Willie. We should have

listened, Willie. You were right all

the time.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE'S VOICE

A voice in the wilderness. A man

named Willie Stark...

WILLIE

How about that, Lucy, that's me.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MADISON

Get up there. Get up there fast.

Your friend, Willie, is hotter than

a firecracker.

MADISON

Stay there with him.

DISSOLVE TO:

POLITICIAN

Look, before this Kanoma City business

we had this whole area tied up. Now

we're losing to Hickville.

POLITICIAN

We must find a way to split that

vote.

HARRISON

Well, all I know is, the way it is

now it looks like I'm not going to

win.

POLITICIAN

I know a way... find a dummy.

SADIE

Find a dummy.

(looks at Harrison)

That's what we've got.

POLITICIAN

A guy from the sticks... strong enough

to grab some votes and dumb enough

not to ask questions.

DUFFY

If you want to listen to a boy from

the sticks, I know just the guy.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

No more politics, eh, Willie?

WILLIE

No, I worked too hard in my time to

get there. I think I'll just go on

practicing law and make a little

more money.

JACK

The question I'd like to know is,

why all the speeches you're making

around the countryside?

WILLIE

Wonder who that is?

DUFFY

Brought some people all the way up

from the state capital just to meet

you.

(turns to others)

Folks, I want you to meet Willie

Stark, the next governor of our state.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

Folks, if you'll just bear patiently

with me for a couple of minutes, I'd

like to tell you what this state

needs. It needs a balanced tax

program. Now I'd like to give you

the facts and the figures.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

How did it sound, Jack?

JACK

Fine, Willie, fine.

WILLIE

(alarmed)

Say... I forgot to send a telegram

to Lucy... Conductor!

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

Now right here... right here I'd

like to add something about last

year's taxes... eh?

DUFFY

I wouldn't add a thing. Just give

them the facts.

PILLSBURY

Yeah... and the figures.

DUFFY

Great speech.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

What this state needs is a balanced

tax program. Last year, last year

the state claimed to have spent on

roads...

JACK

Do you mind if I sit with you, Sadie?

SADIE

(shrugs)

Stand... sit...

JACK

Thanks... Tell me, what are you on

this merry-go-round for?

SADIE

I take notes.

JACK

For whom?

SADIE

For those who pay me.

JACK

Which is.

SADIE

People.

JACK

Smart people.

SADIE

Oh, yeah. Anybody that pays me is

smart.

JACK

You don't have to be smart to frame

a guy like Willie Stark.

SADIE

No. No, brother, you don't.

JACK

(lights a cigarette)

It is a frame, isn't it?

SADIE

Why don't you give me a cigarette?

JACK

(gives her the pack)

To split the vote and win the election

for Harrison, huh?

SADIE

If you know, why do you ask?

JACK

I just want to make sure.

SADIE

Yeah.

JACK

Look, why don't you tell the boys

back home to save their money. Willie

couldn't steal a vote from... from

Abe Lincoln in the Cradle of the

Confederacy.

SADIE

I wish the poor... had enough sense

to have somebody give him a good

greasing for the beating he's going

to get. 'Cause this way all he gets

out of it is the ride.

(looks at Willie

through the window)

Hey, those speeches! Ain't they awful?

Ain't they just plain awful? Question

to you: if somebody told him he was

a sucker, do you think he'd quit?

JACK

I don't know, Sadie. I really don't

know.

WILLIE

(as he comes into the

lobby)

Did it sound all right, Mr. Burden?

JACK

Fine, Willie, fine.

WILLIE

Thanks.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE'S VOICE

Now, friends, if you will bear

patiently with me for a few minutes,

I'll give you the figures. What we

need is a balanced tax program...

JACK'S VOICE

No, Willie, no.

SADIE

What I need is some sleep. Shut up!

JACK

(shouting back at

Sadie)

Shut up yourself!

(goes to bed, shakes

Willie)

Listen, Willie, try it on your feet

this time.

WILLIE

Oh, no. Wait a minute. My feet are

killing me. Let me stay here, huh?

JACK

All right... Look, Willie, you tell

'em too much. Just tell 'em you're

going to soak the fat boys and forget

the rest of the tax stuff.

WILLIE

(pathetically)

That's what I say.

JACK

But it's the way you say it. Willie,

make 'em cry. Make 'em laugh, make

'em mad, even mad at you. Stir 'em

up and they'll love it and come back

for more. But for heaven's sake don't

try and improve their minds.

WILLIE

(suddenly)

A man don't have to be governor.

JACK

(surprised)

What?

WILLIE

A man don't have to be governor.

JACK

Well, they haven't counted up the

votes yet.

WILLIE

(quietly)

Oh, I'm going to lose, Mr. Burden. I

know that. Don't try and fool me.

I'm not going to lie to you. I wanted

it. I wanted it so badly I stayed up

nights thinking about it. A man wants

something so badly he gets mixed up

in knowing what he wants. It's

something inside of you. I would

have made a good governor. Better

than those other fellows.

JACK

Come in.

WILLIE

(almost to himself)

A great governor.

SADIE

Since you won't let me sleep you

might at least give me a drink.

WILLIE

(muttering)

Build them highways... greatest system

of highways in the country.

JACK

(to Sadie)

Help yourself.

WILLIE

I'll build schools.

SADIE

(to Jack)

What's up?

JACK

Nothing... except Willie here has

been saying as how he's not going to

be governor.

SADIE

(directly, to Jack)

So you told him.

JACK

I don't tell anyone anything... I

just listen.

SADIE

(goes to Willie)

Who told you?

WILLIE

Told me what? Told me what?

SADIE

That you're not going to be governor.

WILLIE

(getting up)

Jack! Told me what?... Told me what?

SADIE

(loudly)

All right! That you've been framed,

you poor sap.

WILLIE

(quietly)

Framed?

SADIE

And how! Oh, you decoy, you woodenhead

decoy! And you let 'em. You let 'em

because you thought you were the

little lamb of God. But you know

what you are?

(she waits for his

answer; he has none)

Well, you're the goat! You are the

sacrificial goat! You are a sap...

because you let 'em.

JACK

Sadie! That's enough.

SADIE

Enough? He didn't even get anything

out of it. Oh, they'd have paid you

to take a rap like that, but they

didn't have to pay a sap like you.

Oh, no, you were so full of yourself

and hot air, all you wanted was a

chance to stand up on your hind legs

and make a speech: my friends, what

this state needs is a good five-cent

cigar. What this state needs is a --

WILLIE

(to Jack)

Is it true?

SADIE

(prayerfully, to the

ceiling)

He wants to know if it's true.

WILLIE

Is it true?

JACK

That's what they tell me.

SADIE

(handing it to him)

Here.

JACK

Hey, lay off that. You're not used

to it.

SADIE

(jeeringly)

He's not used to a lot of things.

Are you, Willie?

JACK

(angrily)

Why don't you lay off of him, Sadie?

SADIE

(ignores Jack)

Are you, Willie? Are you? Are you...

are you, are you, are you?

DISSOLVE TO:

SADIE

Hi.

JACK

Well, things seem to have quieted

down.

SADIE

(laughs)

Yeah, I quieted him down.

JACK

Yeah. How was he? Noisy?

SADIE

Oh, he reared some. He's been telling

me all the things he's going to do.

He's going to do big things, this

fella. He's going to be President.

He's going to kill people with his

bare hands. I quieted him down...

Hey! Who's Lucy?

JACK

His wife.

SADIE

He talks like she's his mammy...

she's going to blow his nose for

him.

JACK

Well, I'll take him from here on in.

They're waiting for him at the

barbecue.

SADIE

Yeah, well give me a receipt for the

body and I'll be on my way.

JACK

Hey, Willie, Willie... come on, wake

up, Willie. Come on, Willie.

DISSOLVE TO:

DUFFY

Where is he?

SADIE

(pointing)

There he is.

SADIE

Whoops!

DUFFY

(to Jack)

Is he drunk?

JACK

Never touches the stuff. Lucy doesn't

favor drinkin'.

SADIE

(to Jack)

How'd you get him here? He was out

stiff.

JACK

Hair of the dog that bit him.

SADIE

Hair? He must have swallowed the

dog.

CHAIRMAN

Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a

great deal of pleasure to introduce

to you that true man of the people,

the next governor of the state...

Willie Stark.

WILLIE

My friends...

WILLIE

My friends... I...

WILLIE

I have a speech here. It's a speech

about what this state needs. There's

no need in my telling you what this

state needs. You are the state and

you know what you need... You over

there... look at your pants. Have

they got holes in the knees? Listen

to your stomach. Did you ever hear

it rumble from hunger?... And you,

what about your crops? Did they ever

rot in the field because the road

was so bad you couldn't get them to

market?... And you. What about your

kids? Are they growing up ignorant

as dirt, ignorant as you, 'cause

there's no school for them?... No,

I'm not going to read you any speech.

WILLIE

But I am going to tell you a story.

It's a funny story...

SADIE

(from the steps)

Hey!

WILLIE'S VOICE

...So get ready to laugh.

SADIE

What's he up to?

JACK

Shut up!

WILLIE

Get ready to bust your sides laughing,

'cause it's sure a funny story. It's

about a hick... a hick like you, if

you please. Yeah, like you. He grew

up on the dirt roads and gully washes

of a farm. He knew what it was to

get up before dawn and get feed and

slop and milk before breakfast...

and then set out before sunup and

walk six miles to a one-room, slab-

sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick

knew what it was to be a hick, all

right. He figured if he was going to

get anything done, he had to do it

himself. So he sat up nights and

studied books. He studied law because

he thought he might be able to change

things some... for himself, and for

folks like him.

WILLIE

No, I'm not going to lie to you. He

didn't start off thinking about the

hicks and all the wonderful things

he was going to do for them. No. No,

he started off thinking of number

one. But something came to him on

the way. How he could do nothing for

himself without the help of the

people. That's what came to him. And

it also came to him, with the powerful

force of God's own lightning, back

in his home country, when a

schoolhouse collapsed because it was

built of politics... rotten brick.

It killed and mangled a dozen kids.

But you know that story. The people

were his friends because he fought

that rotten brick. And some of the

politicians down in the city, they

knew that... So they rode up to his

house in a big, fine, shiny car and

said as how they wanted him to run

for governor...

JACK

Sadie, he's wonderful... wonderful...

WILLIE

...So they told the hick... and he

swallowed it. He looked in his heart

and he thought in all humility how

he'd like to try and change things.

He was just a country boy who thought

that even the plainest, poorest man

can be governor if his fellow citizens

find he's got the stuff for the job.

Well, those fellows in the striped

pants... they saw the hick and they

took him in.

DUFFY

(low voice)

Willie, what are you trying to do?

WILLIE

There he is! There's your Judas

Iscariot.

(he pushes Duffy across

the platform)

Look at him... lickspittle... nose-

wiper.

DUFFY

Play! Play!

WILLIE

(pushing him again)

Look at him!

DUFFY

Play anything.

WILLIE

Look at him! Joe Harrison's dummy!

Look at him!

DUFFY

That's a lie!

WILLIE

Look at him!

DUFFY

Go get him, boys... go get him.

WILLIE

Now, shut up! Shut up, all of you.

Now, listen to me, you hicks. Yeah,

you're hicks too, and they fooled

you a thousand times, just like they

fooled me. But this time I'm going

to fool somebody. I'm going to stay

in this race. I'm on my own and I'm

out for blood.

WILLIE

Listen to me, you hicks...

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

Listen to me and lift up your eyes

and look at God's blessed and

unflyblown truth... And this is the

truth. You're a hick. And nobody

ever helped a hick but a hick himself.

WILLIE

All right, listen to me... listen to

me. I was the hick they were going

to use to split the hick vote. But

I'm standing right here now on my

hind legs... even a dog can learn to

do that. Are you standing on your

hind legs? Have you learned to do

that much yet? Here it is, here it

is, you hicks. Nail up anybody who

stands in your way! Nail up Joe

Harrison! Nail up McMurphy! And if

they don't deliver, give me a hammer

and I'll do it myself.

DISSOLVE TO:

POLITICIAN

I want his throat cut, from ear to

ear.

DISSOLVE TO:

MADISON

No use going any further, Jack. We

aren't printing them any more.

JACK

I thought the Chronicle line was --

MADISON

Divide and conquer? Stark is getting

too big for his britches and the

hicks are getting too smart. We're

now supporting Harrison.

JACK

(stands up)

How do you square that?

MADISON

I work here.

JACK

(putting on his coat)

Well, I don't... not any more.

MADISON

Jack, you fool.

JACK

If you had any guts you'd print

this...

MADISON

I work here. I take orders.

JACK

I know. You've got a wife and three

kids and your boy goes to Princeton.

MADISON

You won't find it easy to get another

job.

JACK

I'm too rich to work.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

We didn't do so good.

WILLIE

Double bourbon.

SADIE

(sitting next to Jack)

Same for me.

WILLIE

And a beer.

(to Jack)

I hear you got fired from the paper.

JACK

You heard wrong, Willie. I quit.

WILLIE

(passing the beer

back to Sugar Boy)

You're smart. 'Cause before I'm

through with that mob they're not

going to have enough money left to

pay the boy that cleans the spittoons.

JACK

How do you feel, Willie?

WILLIE

I feel fine, fine. You see, Jack, I

learned something.

JACK

Yeah... what?

WILLIE

How to win.

FADE OUT

JACK

(voice over)

I didn't see Willie again until his

second campaign... four years later.

JACK

(voice over)

I drifted from job to job...

JACK

(voice over)

...That is, whenever I could find

one.

JACK

(voice over)

But always further and further away

from Anne, and the life at Burden's

Landing.

JACK

(voice over)

But Willie wasn't drifting. He knew

where he was going.

JACK

(voice over)

He had his foot in the door and he

kept right on pushing to get in. He

had lost the election but he had won

the state... and he knew it... and

the people knew it.

JACK

(voice over)

They were all hopping on his

bandwagon... even Tiny Duffy.

JACK

(voice over)

Yep, Willie came back like he said

he would.

WILLIE

Do you want to know what my platform

is? Here it is: I'm going to soak

the fat boys and I'm going to spread

it thin.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

(voice over)

Willie was right -- he'd learned how

to win...

JACK

(voice over)

He spent a lot of money doing it...

an awful lot of money... I was

beginning to wonder where he got it

from.

JACK

(voice over)

There were rumors throughout the

state that Willie was making deals

with all kinds of people... strange

deals... for Willie Stark.

JACK

(voice over)

The second time out, it wasn't a

campaign... it was a slaughter. It

was Saturday night in a mining town.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

(voice over)

He came back and he took me with

him.

WILLIE

This is Jack Burden, a friend of

mine. From now on he's going to live

here. Give him anything he wants.

DUFFY

Let these boys through, officer.

WILLIE

(to Jack)

Duffy works for me now.

JACK

It looks like everybody works for

you.

WILLIE

No. No, not yet. But I want to keep

him around. He reminds me of something

I never want to forget.

WILLIE

(to Duffy)

Come on, come on, come on, come on.

Are these the boys?

DUFFY

These are the boys that can get the

boys.

WILLIE

How many do you think we can get?

DUFFY

Fifty.

WILLIE

How much?

DUFFY

Five dollars a head.

WILLIE

(to Sugar Boy)

What do you think, Sugar? Do they

look like good boys?

SUGAR BOY

T-t-they b-b-better be.

WILLIE

Get a hundred... All right, go on,

all of you. Blow. Blow, blow. You

too, Duffy. Go on.

WILLIE

(to Jack)

Handbill distributors.

JACK

If they all look like them I'd hate

not to take one.

WILLIE

That's the object. Not like when

they beat up my boy Tom.

JACK

How is Tom?

WILLIE

Oh, he's fine. He starts college in

the fall.

JACK

Oh. And Lucy?

WILLIE

Fine... fine.

SADIE

Hey, I need a boy... Where's a boy?

(boy runs up)

Take that downstairs; they're waiting

for it. Right away, on the double.

(to typist)

Listen, baby, you've got to double-

space all of this... he can't read,

see.

JACK

Sadie!

SADIE

(to typist)

And they need four copies.

(looks up)

Hi, Jack. How are you?

WILLIE

Sadie is my secretary now.

(to messenger, trying

to squeeze by)

Oh, pardon me.

SADIE

Fix your tie, Willie.

WILLIE

Hey, Sugar.

WILLIE

Keep everybody out of here. I want

to talk to Jack and Sadie alone.

WILLIE

From now on you're working for me.

JACK

Doing what?

WILLIE

I don't know. Something will turn

up, won't it, Sadie?

SADIE

Yeah. We need a college man around...

for research.

WILLIE

How much did they pay you on that

newspaper?

JACK

Three hundred dollars a month.

WILLIE

(laughs)

I could buy you cheap, couldn't I?

JACK

For a bag of salt.

WILLIE

No. No, I don't play that way. I

like you, boy. I always have. I'll

tell you what I'll do. I'll give you

four hundred dollars a month and

traveling expenses.

JACK

You throw money around like it was

money.

WILLIE

Money?... I don't need money. People

give me things.

JACK

Why?

WILLIE

Because they believe in me.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

(voice over)

I was going home again. But this

time it was different. Now I had a

feeling that maybe the waiting was

over... for me, and for Anne.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

It's a far cry from where I come

from... to this house.

WILLIE

And standing here under the portrait

of one of the greatest governors of

this state, talking to you people...

well, it's an honor I never thought

I'd have.

JACK

Are there any questions?

(looks around)

Mr. McEvoy.

MCEVOY

(smiles)

No, I have no questions.

JACK

Judge?

JUDGE

A few... but it will hold.

STANTON

I have a question.

WILLIE

Shoot.

STANTON

A lot of people in this state have

been saying that you've been making

deals... some of them with the very

groups that you claim you're against.

Is that true?

JACK

Adam, you know how rumors start...

WILLIE

Yes. Yes, that's true. I have nothing

to hide. I'll make a deal with the

devil if it'll help me carry out my

program. But believe me, there are

no strings attached to those deals.

STANTON

You're sure about that?

WILLIE

Doc, Jack here has been telling me

how you feel about things... how

you'd like to see a new hospital

built, a hospital that's the biggest

and best that money can buy. You

want those things, Doc, because,

well, because you're a man who wants

to do good. Now, I'd like to ask you

a question.

STANTON

Shoot.

WILLIE

Do you know what good comes out of?

STANTON

You tell me, Mr. Stark.

WILLIE

Out of bad... that's what good comes

out of. Because you can't make it

out of anything else. You didn't

know that, did you?

STANTON

No, I didn't... There's another

question I'd like to ask you. You

say there's only bad to start with

and the good must come with the bad.

Who's to determine what's good and

what's bad?... You?

WILLIE

Why not?

STANTON

How?

WILLIE

Why, that's easy. Just... just make

it up as you go along.

WILLIE

Folks, there's a time to talk and

there's a time to act. I think the

time to act is right now. And with

your support, I not only will win

but I will do all of the things I

promised. I need your help. Oh, I

need it badly. But I'm not going to

beg for it. In the name of this state

which we love... in the name of the

governor in whose house we meet... I

demand it.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

(to Judge)

Well, what do you say, sir?

JACK

You've got to say yes. With you in

the race...

JUDGE

I'm an old bird... I...

WILLIE

But a game one.

WILLIE

Look, I'll give you complete power

as attorney general. You can do

anything you see fit. I'll swing the

ax to clear the way for you. Is that

a deal?

JUDGE

It's a deal.

WILLIE

Jack, we have to get back to town...

a lot to do.

(shakes hands with

Adam)

Dr. Stanton.

ANNE

I'm very glad to have met you.

FADE OUT

DISSOLVE TO:

CROWD

We want Willie! We want Willie!

WILLIE

(raises his hands for

silence)

This is not a time for speechmaking.

I should get on my knees and ask God

to give me strength to carry out

your will.

WILLIE

This much I swear to you. These things

you shall have. I'm going to build a

hospital. The biggest that money can

buy... and it will belong to you.

That any man, woman, or child who is

sick or in pain can go through those

doors and know that everything will

be done for them that man can do. To

heal sickness. To ease pain. Free.

Not as a charity, but as a right.

And it is your right that every child

shall have a complete education.

That any man who produces anything

can take it to market without paying

toll. And no poor man's land or farm

can be taxed or taken away from him.

And it is the right of the people

that they will not be deprived of

hope...

ANNE

Does he mean it, Jack? Does he?

STANTON

(as he walks away)

That's his bribe.

FADE OUT

JACK

(voice over)

What if it was his bribe! He swept

the old gang out of office. What if

they hollered like stuck pigs? He

jammed through bill after bill and

the people got what they wanted.

WILLIE

I demand that this bill be passed.

Nobody's going to tell me how to run

this state.

JACK

(voice over)

He started to build the roads, the

schools, the power dams, to change

the face of the state from one end

to the other... His methods?

JACK

(voice over)

Politics is a dirty game... and he

played it rough and dirty. Willie's

little black book was a record of

sin and corruption. And me, Jack

Burden? I kept the book and added up

the accounts.

JACK

(voice over)

Clown, show-off, playboy, they yelled

at him. Building football stadiums.

Fiercely proud of his son who played

in them.

WILLIE

Oh, look at him go. He's going to be

All-American.

JACK

(voice over)

They said he was building up a private

army. But he was building, always

building...

JACK

(voice over)

Always playing up to the crowd.

Letting them trample on tradition.

Well, tradition needed trampling on.

JACK

(voice over)

The crowd loved it... Willie loved

it... and so did I.

FADE OUT

SADIE

(through open door)

You low-down, no-good redneck...

JACK

(to secretary)

What goes on here?

SECRETARY

That's what Sadie wants to know.

(she shows Jack

newspaper containing

photograph of Willie

at the nightclub)

The boss poses for too many pictures.

SADIE

I'll kill him.

JACK

Why, Sadie, I'm surprised at you.

SADIE

I'll kill him.

SADIE

I hate all women.

SADIE

Was she pretty?

SADIE

Was she pretty?

JACK

If I met her on the street I'd never

recognize her.

SADIE

Was she pretty?

JACK

How should I know? I wasn't looking

at her face... Look, if it's going

to cause all this grief, why don't

you let him go?

SADIE

Let him go? I'll kill him. I'll drive

him out of this state.

JACK

Just because a guy's sitting with a

couple of girls on his knees in

public...

SADIE

Public or private... I know him. How

about what happened in Chicago? That

girl on skates... and the time you

both went to St. Louis... There's a

new invention, you know, Photography

and newsreels. Willie Stark in a

nightclub... Willie Stark with a

blonde.

JACK

You could always bleach your hair.

SADIE

I could also break every bone in his

neck. After all I've done for him...

Now he goes two-timing me.

JACK

He's been two-timing Lucy. So there's

another kind of arithmetic for what

he's doing to you.

SADIE

Lucy?

(laughs)

If she had her way he'd be back in

Kanoma City slopping the hogs right

now. And he knows it. He knows what

she'd do for him. She had her chance.

JACK

You seem to think Lucy's on her way

out, don't you?

SADIE

He'll ditch her... Give him time.

JACK

You ought to know.

JACK

Hey, you got the wrong guy. I'm not

the hero of this piece.

WILLIE

All right, come on, both of you.

Let's go, hurry it up.

WILLIE

Come on. Pillsbury put his hand in

the pork barrel and got caught. You

know, I never did trust that guy.

NEWSMEN

Have you heard about Pillsbury? What

do you intend to do about Pillsbury?

How about it, Governor?

WILLIE

Later, boys, later.

(to Jack)

Say, Jack, go back and get the Judge.

Let's get him over to my hotel just

as soon as you can.

ANNE

(to Willie)

I waited for you.

(she sees Sadie)

Hello.

(back to Willie)

You promised we could... uh... discuss

my charity project... Children's

home?

WILLIE

Well, I'm very sorry. Something very

important came up. You'll call me

later, won't you?

ANNE

Yes, certainly.

SADIE

We're late.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

Look at you, Pillsbury. Fifty years

old, gut-sprung, teeth gone, never

had a dime. If the Almighty had

intended for you to be rich he'd

have taken care of that a long time

ago. The idea of you being rich...

that's plain blasphemy. Ain't that a

fact?

WILLIE

Answer me!

PILLSBURY

Yes.

WILLIE

Louder, man. Don't mumble. Speak up.

Say it's a fact, a blasphemous fact.

PILLSBURY

It's a fact, a blasphemous fact.

SADIE

Yeah?... Oh, I see.

(hangs up)

Dumond can't come. He says his wife

is sick.

WILLIE

I don't care if she's dying. Sugar,

get the car. Get him and bring him

over here.

WILLIE

Now, you know what you're supposed

to do, don't you, Pillsbury? You're

supposed to stay poor and take orders.

Oh, there'll be some sweetening for

you from time to time... but Duffy'll

take care of that. Don't you go

setting yourself up on your own again,

do you understand that?

PILLSBURY

Yes.

WILLIE

Louder, man. And say, I understand

that.

PILLSBURY

I understand that.

WILLIE

Give him a pen and some paper, Sadie.

WILLIE

See who that is, Duffy.

WILLIE

Oh, hello, Judge. Sit down. I'll be

with you in just a couple of seconds.

(back to Pillsbury)

Now write what I tell you to write...

Dear Governor Stark. I wish to resign

as auditor due to ill health, to

take effect as soon as you can relieve

me. Respectfully yours.

(after a pause)

Did you sign it?

PILLSBURY

No.

WILLIE

(roaring)

Well, sign it! Don't put any date on

it. I can fill that in when I need

it.

WILLIE

Now bring it to me.

WILLIE

Now get out.

JUDGE

The papers have the story.

WILLIE

Yeah, I know.

JUDGE

They're talking about impeachment

proceedings.

WILLIE

(rising)

Against who?

JUDGE

This time, Pillsbury.

WILLIE

I got that "this time," Judge.

JUDGE

How true is it?

WILLIE

It's too true.

SADIE

Yes?

(hands phone to Willie)

This is it, Willie. Jeff Hopkins on

the wire.

WILLIE

What have we got on Hopkins, Jack?

(as Jack riffles

through the black

book)

Hello, Jeff. About that Pillsbury

business...

(reads from black

book Jack holds out

for him)

Here's what I want you to do when it

comes up in the legislature. Now,

wait a minute, wait a minute. You

listen to me.

(still reading from

book)

You got a mortgage coming due on

that place of yours in about five

weeks, haven't you? You'd like to

get it renewed, wouldn't you?

(pause)

All right, Tiny'll talk to you in

the morning.

WILLIE

Get going, Tiny.

JUDGE

You haven't answered my question.

Why are you saving Pillsbury's hide?

WILLIE

I'm not a bit interested in

Pillsbury's hide. It's something

much more important than that. If

the McMurphy boys get the notion

they can get away with this, there's

no telling where they'll stop.

JUDGE

(quietly)

Or where you will... Pillsbury is

guilty. As attorney general of this

state, it's my job to prosecute.

WILLIE

Judge, you talk like Pillsbury was...

was human. He isn't. He's a thing.

You don't prosecute an adding machine

if the spring goes busted and makes

a mistake. You fix it. Well, I fixed

him. I'm not a bit interested in

Pillsbury. It's something much bigger

than that.

JUDGE

(getting up)

Yes, it is.

JACK

He's right, Judge. Can't you see

that he's right?

JUDGE

He's right because you want him to

be right. Because you're afraid to

admit you've made a mistake. Do it

now before it's too late.

(to Willie)

I'm offering my resignation as

attorney general. You'll have it in

writing by messenger in the morning...

dated.

WILLIE

(softly)

It took you a long time to make up

your mind, Judge. A long time. What

made you take such a long time?

JUDGE

I wasn't sure.

WILLIE

And now you are?

WILLIE

I'll tell you what you are. You're

scared. You sat in that big easy

chair of yours for thirty years and

played at being a judge. Then all of

a sudden I came along and put a bat

in your hand, and I said, go ahead,

Judge, start swinging. And you did.

And you had a wonderful time. But

now you're scared. You don't want to

get your hands dirty. You want to

pick up the marbles... but you don't

want to get your hands dirty. Look

at my whole program, Judge. How do

you think I put that across?

JUDGE

I knew how, but I never knew why.

WILLIE

You're not by any chance thinking of

going over to McMurphy's boys, are

you?

JUDGE

I'm through with politics.

WILLIE

I'm happy to hear that.

(extends his hand)

No hard feelings.

JUDGE

(ignores the hand)

Goodbye, Governor.

(to Jack)

Are you coming with me, Jack?

JUDGE

You're making a mistake.

WILLIE

Do you think he means it when he

says he's through with politics,

Sadie?

SADIE

No. No, I don't.

WILLIE

What about you, Jack?

JACK

I've known the Judge all my life.

He's always meant everything he's

said.

WILLIE

All right. All right. Take it easy.

I'll take your word for it.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

Sugar, take Miss Stanton home.

(to Anne)

When am I going to see you again?

WILLIE

What's the matter, Anne?

ANNE

Please take me home now, Sugar Boy.

WILLIE

You've got to understand me.

ANNE

(turns away)

I understand you. It's myself I don't

understand.

WILLIE

Do you think I like sneaking around

corners any more than you do? But

right now, with the Pillsbury business

and with your uncle quitting... If I

got a divorce...

ANNE

Maybe we'd better stop seeing each

other.

WILLIE

No. No, we won't stop seeing each

other, will we?

ANNE

(slowly)

No.

WILLIE

Because you believe in what I tell

you.

ANNE

(puts her hand on his)

Because I believe what you tell me.

SADIE

Good evening, Governor Stark.

(looks at Anne, but

talks to Willie)

I thought you might like to know

that Judge Stanton kept his promise.

(directly to Willie)

He gave the story to every paper in

town.

WILLIE

Sugar, meet me at the hotel as soon

as you can.

FADE OUT

SENATOR

These are serious charges that Judge

Stanton has given to the press. This

legislature is entitled to a complete

and full report on the Pillsbury

affair. Let the truth be known.

2ND SENATOR

Let it come out.

3RD SENATOR

I move that we adjourn.

4TH SENATOR

I second the motion.

CHAIRMAN

All those in favor, say aye... Motion

carried. The house is adjourned.

DISSOLVE TO:

MAN

If you let Willie Stark get away

with the Pillsbury graft, there's no

telling...

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

But we beat the Pillsbury rap...

It's over.

WILLIE

These things are never over. I'll

tell you what I want you to do, Jack.

I want you to start a new page in

that black book of yours... under

then name of Judge Stanton.

JACK

You're crazy. There's nothing on the

Judge.

SADIE

Why? Because his name is Stanton?

WILLIE

Ssshhh, easy.

JACK

What if I won't do it?

WILLIE

You know, some of this has rubbed

off on you.

JACK

What are you going to do? Have me

shot?

WILLIE

No... no... but I'll have to get

myself a new boy.

JACK

I tell you there's nothing on the

Judge.

WILLIE

Jack, there's something on everybody.

Man is conceived in sin and born in

corruption.

JACK

It's a waste of time.

WILLIE

What's the matter, Jack? Are you

afraid you might find something out?

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

(voice over)

I kept saying to myself that Willie

was wrong about the Judge. If there

was anything left at Burden's Landing,

it was honor. I had to believe that.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

Anne, I want to ask you a question.

Was the Judge ever broke? Really

broke?

ANNE

Why do you want to know?

JACK

I don't want to know, but I've got

to.

ANNE

Did he tell you --

JACK

Did who tell me?

ANNE

I don't know. I... how should I know

if the Judge was ever broke?

STANTON

Hello... Come on, Anne, take this

food and start cooking. I'm hungry.

JACK

Me, I'm on the thirsty side. Bring

some glasses, Anne, quick.

STANTON

(laughing)

It's been a long time since I played

this thing. What do you say we wake

up the ghosts, huh?

JACK

(calling to Anne)

Another glass, Anne, for a ghost.

STANTON

(starting to play)

Remember the last time I played this?

You and Anne were dancing?

JACK

Shall we dance?

ANNE

Let's... let's have a drink first.

JACK

No, no... keep playing. Anne and I

want to hear this, don't we, Anne?

(Jack pours the wine)

Adam... ghost... and me.

STANTON

What shall we drink to?

JACK

To the ghost?... To Adam, to the

director of the new medical center.

STANTON

(bangs the piano keys)

Don't you ever stop working for him?

ANNE

Adam!

STANTON

I came up here to get away...

JACK

I'm sorry, Adam.

ANNE

Well, I'm not. What's wrong with

being the director of the new medical

center?

STANTON

Nothing, except that I'm not going

to take it.

JACK

Why? Because your uncle resigned?

STANTON

That's partly it. There are other

things.

ANNE

What other things?

STANTON

(looks at her)

You too?

ANNE

Yes, me too.

JACK

Anne, if Adam doesn't want to discuss

it, let's not.

STANTON

All right, let's discuss it.

ANNE

But calmly.

STANTON

Calmly. Go ahead, Jack. Why do you

think he wants me?

JACK

Because you're the best man for the

job.

STANTON

It could have nothing to do with my

name being Stanton?

JACK

It could have. Let's grant that.

STANTON

That's your answer.

JACK

No, it's not. If that were the only

answer I wouldn't be with him any

more. There's another side of it.

I've learned something from him. You

can't make an omelet without cracking

eggs.

STANTON

Or heads.

ANNE

But at least a hospital will be built,

and the sick will be cared for.

STANTON

At what price?

JACK

At any price.

STANTON

Do you really believe that, Jack?

JACK

I really believe that Stark wants to

do good. You do too. It's a matter

of method. Many times out of evil

comes good. Well, pain is an evil.

As a doctor you should know that.

STANTON

Pain is an evil; it is not evil. It

is not evil in itself. Stark is evil.

JACK

The people of the state don't think

so.

STANTON

How would they know? The first thing

he did was to take over the newspapers

and the radio stations. Why be so

afraid of criticism? If Stark is

interested in doing good, he should

also be interested in the truth. I

don't see how you can separate the

two. No, Stark is not for me.

ANNE

(upset)

No, Stark is not for you. Well, what

is for you? Pride. Pride, that's all

it is... foolish, stupid pride. All

you've ever talked about is what you

could do if... if somebody would

tear down and build. All right, all

right, somebody has, and he's given

it to you. But he's not for you. No,

he's not for you.

STANTON

Anne... Anne...

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

(voice over)

Will I find anything, Judge? Will I?

I didn't find it all at once. It

takes a long time to go through old

courthouse records and musty deeds...

a very long time. But it wasn't too

hard for me. I was well trained in

research, especially this kind.

JACK

(voice over)

I found what I didn't want to find.

JACK

Have some photostat copies made of

these. I'll be back tomorrow for

them.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

Who is it?

SADIE'S VOICE

It's me, Sadie Burke.

JACK

Wait a minute.

JACK

All right, come in.

SADIE

Phew! Awful lot of smoke. Awful lot

of whisky. You sober?

JACK

Stone.

SADIE

I'll have one with you.

(starts tidying up

the room)

What are you hiding out for?

JACK

I'm not. I've been sleeping.

SADIE

For four days? You've been back in

town for four days.

JACK

Willie knows everything.

SADIE

Willie's worried about his boy.

JACK

Willie's boy is worried about Willie's

boy.

SADIE

Well, why don't you put something on

the phonograph -- a low-down, mean

blues. Play it over and over again

until you're sick of it. Then crack

it and go back to work.

(sits down)

I do it all the time.

JACK

That's not my problem.

SADIE

No, it isn't your problem.

(gets up again)

I'll wait for you if you want to

powder your nose.

JACK

I'll be with you in a minute.

SADIE

Hmmm. Yeah, I can see it. I've got

to look in the mirror to be able to

see it. Soft, white skin... not like

mine.

(runs her hand across

her cheeks)

I had smallpox when I was a kid.

Where I lived it seemed nearly all

the kids had smallpox...

SADIE

It leaves your face hard. Then she's

got poise. Look at the way she holds

her head... at just the right angle.

That takes training. That takes years

of training...

SADIE

I see what Willie sees. Willie's got

big ideas, Jack.

JACK

What do you mean?

SADIE

A girl like that could be a governor's

wife. Or even a President's.

JACK

What are you talking about?

SADIE

He ditched Lucy, he ditched me, and

he'll ditch you.

JACK

(shaking her)

Answer me!

SADIE

He'll ditch everybody in the whole

world because that's what Willie

wants. Nobody in the world but him.

JACK

What are you talking about?

SADIE

You and your high-tone friends. What

do they know? What do they know about

anything? Why did you have to mix

her in?

JACK

You're crazy, Sadie. You're out of

your mind.

SADIE

Am I? Well, why don't you go down

and ask her. Or ask him. Ask Willie.

JACK

Shut up!

SADIE

Go ahead, ask him.

JACK

Shut up!

SADIE

Ask him!

SADIE

Ow-oo... oh... oh.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

He's off today.

WILLIE

It's only practice. He'll be all

right tomorrow... You been gone a

long time, Jack.

JACK

Yeah. I figured if you needed me

you'd yell.

WILLIE

Why'd you lay around the hotel?

JACK

Thinking.

WILLIE

About what?

JACK

Things.

WILLIE

What did you find on the Judge?

JACK

Nothing.

WILLIE

You sure you didn't find anything on

the Judge?

JACK

Yeah, I'm sure.

WILLIE

You're going to keep trying, aren't

you?

JACK

If you want me to.

WILLIE

I want you to. There's something

else I want you to do too.

JACK

What? Bucket boy? Towel slinger?

What?

WILLIE

(looks at him closely)

What's eating you, Jack?

JACK

(avoiding it)

What else do you want me to do?

WILLIE

If you've got something on your mind,

boy, spit it out. We've been together

too long to play games.

JACK

What do you want me to do?

WILLIE

I hear your pal Adam Stanton turned

down the job as director of the

hospital. That's bad. Especially at

a time like this.

JACK

Oh? How did you hear it?

WILLIE

Why? What difference does it make?

JACK

I just wanted to know.

WILLIE

I heard it around.

JACK

(insistent)

How did you hear he turned it down,

Willie?

WILLIE

I'll be right back, Jack. I want to

see what's happening here.

COACH

You going to practice the way I tell

you.

TOM

I'm going to do it the way I want to

do it.

WILLIE

Tom, come here. What's going on here?

COACH

I don't care if he is your son,

Governor... No special rules for

him.

TOM

It doesn't make any difference to me

either way... whether I play or not.

WILLIE

Well, it does to me.

(to coach)

What do you want him to do?

COACH

To behave himself. Like the rest of

the boys. Four times this season

he's broken training. He comes on

the practice field half potted.

WILLIE

Tom, you're going to have to obey

the rules. Do you hear me? You're

going to obey the rules.

TOM

I put 'em across, don't I? Every

Saturday I put 'em across and I can

still do it, drunk or sober. That's

all you want, isn't it... for me to

put 'em across so you can big-shot

it around? Isn't that all you want?

WILLIE

Tom!

(to coach)

He's a little high-strung.

(goes after Tom)

Tom, come here. Tom!

DISSOLVE TO:

HELENE

(laughing)

Come on, Tommy... let's go faster.

Come on...

2ND COP

(looking at Tom)

It's the governor's son.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

LUCY

Willie, Mr. Hale's here to see you.

WILLIE

Go on upstairs, Lucy. I have some

business I want to talk over with

Mr. Hale.

HALE

What I've got to say anybody can

listen to... Where's your boy?

WILLIE

Now... now, don't get excited.

(to Sugar Boy)

Get me another drink, Sugar.

HALE

My daughter may die.

WILLIE

She's not going to die. She'll get

the best medical attention there is.

No expense will be spared.

HALE

Where's your boy?

LUCY

I'll get him.

WILLIE

Wait a minute, Lucy. He's asleep.

And the doctor said after a good

night's sleep he'll be all right.

LUCY

No, he won't be all right unless you

make him all right. I'll get him.

WILLIE

Lucy!

(to Hale)

You care for a drink?

HALE

No thanks.

WILLIE

Accidents will happen, you know.

HALE

Accidents? Your boy was drunk.

WILLIE

I saw the police report. There...

there was nothing about drunkenness

on the police report.

HALE

Whose police and whose report? I say

the boy was drunk. And I know it.

HALE

(to Tom)

Right here before your father... I

want you --

TOM

Mr. Hale --

WILLIE

Tom, the doctor says you need rest,

boy.

TOM

(turns on him)

I don't want you to try to cover up

for me. I was wrong... that's all

there is to it.

WILLIE

You don't know what you're talking

about. I saw the police report --

TOM

I don't care what the police report

says. I was driving and I was drunk.

It's all my fault.

(to Hale)

Anything you want to do to me, you

can do. Whatever you want me to do,

I'll do.

WILLIE

Nobody has to do anything. Stop

worrying. I'll take care of

everything.

TOM

I don't want you to take care of

anything.

WILLIE

Tom, go on upstairs and get some

rest, boy. Go on... go on... go on.

WILLIE

Sugar, help him... Mr. Hale, come on

over and sit down. You sure you

wouldn't care for a drink, Mr. Hale?

WILLIE

Hey, Tiny, go home. Go on, out of

here... out of here. Go on.

WILLIE

What business did you say you were

in?

HALE

I didn't say.

WILLIE

What business are you in?

HALE

Trucking business.

WILLIE

Trucking business. Trucks run on

state roads. If a man in the trucking

business had a contract with the

state, a big one, that would be pretty

good, wouldn't it?

(to Jack)

Go on, Jack. Tell him what would

happen.

WILLIE

Go on, tell him.

HALE

You're trying to bribe me, aren't

you?

WILLIE

No, no. No, I'm not trying to bribe

you. I'm... I'm only talking things

over with you, that's all.

HALE

You're pretty good at talking. I

remember when you first started

talking. A place called Upton. You

did a lot of talking then and the

things you said made sense, to me

and a lot of other people. I believed

in you... I followed you... and I

fought for you. Well, the words are

still good. But you're not.

(rises)

And I don't believe you ever were.

WILLIE

(after a pause)

Sugar, follow him. Keep calling in.

WILLIE

(yells)

Lucy!... Lucy!

JACK

I'd like Anne to see you now. I'd

like Anne to see you now, you drunken

sot!

(drags him up the

stairs)

Come on.

FADE OUT

DISSOLVE TO:

NEWSMEN

What about the girl's father,

Governor? Have you a statement to

make?

WILLIE

All right, all right, gentlemen.

I'll give you a statement. This whole

thing is a mess of lies. It's a frame.

The man that made that statement...

have him repeat it to my face. He

can't. He vanished. Let me ask you

some questions. Where has he gone?

Where is he?

REPORTER

Maybe you could answer those questions

too, Governor.

WILLIE

I won't dignify that question with

an answer.

ANOTHER REPORTER

One more question, Governor... Where's

your son?

WILLIE

At the football stadium, where he's

supposed to be. He's going to play

for State University, which this

administration is responsible for.

He's not hiding from anybody,

gentlemen. He'll be out there in

full view of seventy thousand cheering

fans.

(starts down the stairs)

One of which will be me. See you,

men.

DISSOLVE TO:

CROWD VOICES

Where's Stark? How about Tommy Stark?

Hey, Willie, send your boy in.

WILLIE

Why don't they put him in!

Come on, Willie... send your boy in.

What's the matter, Willie... is your

little boy ashamed to show his face?

DUFFY

Shut up!

WILLIE

Get that man out of here! Come on,

get him out of here.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

They're booing you.

TOM

(holds his head)

Ever since the accident, my head...

WILLIE

The doctor said it was nothing.

TOM

Get dizzy... can't see... dizzy...

WILLIE

You're scared... plain scared.

TOM

(looks up angrily)

Get out of here!

WILLIE

Atta boy... get mad. Show some spirit.

Jack, tell him what his playing means.

Go on, tell him.

JACK

You can never tell about a head

injury. Maybe the boy's hurt.

WILLIE

He's hurt? I'm hurt. It wasn't me

that wrapped that car around the

tree. It wasn't me that got drunk.

But me, I'm takin' the rap.

(softer, to Tom)

Go on, kid. Get out there and play.

Show 'em the kind of stuff a Stark

is made of.

TOM

(coldly)

I wouldn't know.

JACK

Tom... cut it out!

TOM

(breathing heavily)

All right, I'll play. Now get out of

here.

B-b-boss, you gotta eat. You g-g-

gotta.

WILLIE

I'm the one that made him play. I

LUCY

Sit down, Willie. Please sit down.

WILLIE

I sent him in.

LUCY

What difference does that make now?

WILLIE

What goes on?

JACK

There isn't a plane flying.

WILLIE

They gotta fly. This is my son. He's

got to live.

STANTON

I just got a call from Dr. Birnham.

The earliest he can possibly get

here will be tomorrow morning.

WILLIE

Isn't there anybody else we can get?

JACK

I still think Dr. Stanton should

operate.

STANTON

That's up to Governor Stark. He wanted

another doctor... a specialist. I

sent for one.

WILLIE

How bad is it really, doctor?

STANTON

He's unconscious... and paralyzed.

WILLIE

Has he got a chance?

STANTON

To live? Yes.

WILLIE

What do you mean?

STANTON

Even if the operation's successful --

that is, if he lives -- I think he'll

be paralyzed for life.

WILLIE

You'll do everything you can, won't

you? Anything between you and me..

that won't count, will it? It doesn't

have to. Look, doc, anything you

want in the world you just ask for

it and you got it. Go on, doc... ask

for it.

STANTON

(coldly)

There are some things, Governor Stark,

that even you can't buy. Do you want

me to operate, or don't you?

LUCY

Yes... I want you to operate.

(stands up)

Please, may I see Tom now?

STANTON

Yes.

WILLIE

(to Jack)

How much does the doc know?

JACK

About what?

WILLIE

Oh, you know what I'm talking about.

JACK

About what?

WILLIE

About Anne and me.

JACK

(after a pause)

He doesn't know a thing... not a

thing.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNE

Jack, how is he?

JACK

The boy?

ANNE

Yes.

JACK

He'll live.

ANNE

Oh, thank God. How is --

JACK

Willie?

ANNE

He blames himself, doesn't he?

JACK

(as he walks down the

street)

He'll find someone else to blame in

a few days.

ANNE

(following him)

Oh, I tried to call here at the

hospital, but I just...

JACK

Anne... Anne, why did you do it?

ANNE

He wasn't like anybody I ever knew

before.

JACK

You mean he wasn't like me.

ANNE

He wasn't like anybody I ever knew

before. I love him, I guess. I guess

that's the reason.

JACK

Everybody loves him.

ANNE

He wants to marry me.

JACK

Are you going to?

ANNE

Not now. It would hurt him. A divorce

would hurt his career.

JACK

His career!

ANNE

Jack... Jack, what are you going to

do? You can't leave him now. He needs

you now more than he ever did before.

JACK

What Willie needs, Willie's got.

ANNE

You don't know him. You've known him

all these years and you don't really

know him at all.

JACK

What about Adam?

ANNE

Adam?

JACK

Well, you don't have to worry about

him. If Adam finds out it'll be easy

to prove a Stanton is no different

than anybody else.

(gives her the papers

on the Judge)

Just show him these. Willie was

right... a man is conceived in sin

and born in corruption. Even Judge

Stanton. Show them to him, Anne.

Change the picture of the world that

Adam has in his head, just like our

picture of it has been changed.

JACK

Wipe out everything he's ever believed

in. It'll be good for him. There's

no God but Willie Stark. I'm his

prophet and you're his...

(pushes her aside,

then feels sorry and

walks after her)

Oh, Anne... Anne, I'm sorry. I didn't

mean... Anne!

POLICEMAN

What's going on here?

JACK

It's all right, officer... we both

work for Willie Stark.

FADE OUT

WILLIE

(to Adam)

Right over there, that's going to be

the main building... fifteen stories

high, like on the model. Over there,

that's the laboratory. Finest

technical equipment in the world.

STANTON

What are you trying to convince me

of? I've taken the job.

WILLIE

Why?

STANTON

My reasons are my own. Why are you

building a hospital?

WILLIE

To do some good for the people of

the state.

STANTON

And get some votes.

WILLIE

Oh, there are lots of ways to get

votes.

STANTON

Yes, I know... I won't stand for any

interference.

WILLIE

I won't interfere. I may fire you,

but I won't interfere.

STANTON

If that's a threat, you're wasting

your time. You know what I think of

your administration.

WILLIE

Yes, I know. I'll tell you what...

You stay on your side of the fence;

I'll stay on mine. Is that a deal?

JACK

(voice over)

Now he had us all... me, Anne, and

Adam. Now we all worked for him.

FADE OUT

NARRATOR'S VOICE

And so the eyes of the entire nation

are now focused upon Governor Willie

Stark, an amazing phenomenon on the

American political scene. The whole

state is filled with his

accomplishments -- each of them, of

course, bearing his personal

signature, to make sure that no one

will ever forget who gave them to

the state.

NARRATOR'S VOICE

This is the way the roads used to

be. But there are those who claim

that they were adequate for the

people's needs, that you don't need

a four- or six-lane highway for a

horse and buggy.

NARRATOR'S VOICE

When Stark boasts of his great school

system, his critics say: you can't

go to school and work in the fields

at the same time. And they question

the benefit of these projects,

charging that the need and the poverty

of the people is as great as before.

NARRATOR'S VOICE

Willie Stark has never forgotten the

source of his power: the people who

supported him.

NARRATOR'S VOICE

He still keeps in touch with these

people of the backwoods, making

periodic trips to such places as

Kanoma City, now famous as his

birthplace...

NARRATOR'S VOICE

For those who say that Willie Stark

is a man of destiny, there are others

who claim that he is a man of evil,

a man who cares neither for the people

nor the state, but only for his own

personal power and ambition.

NARRATOR'S VOICE

Obviously, these ambitions go far

beyond the boundaries of the state.

Just how far, only time will tell.

Meanwhile, he is here...

NARRATOR'S VOICE

...and from the looks of things, he

is here to stay. Willie Stark: messiah

or dictator?

PRODUCER

How do you like it, Governor?

WILLIE

How many theaters will this play in?

PRODUCER

All over the country.

WILLIE

Hear that, Jack. All over the country.

WILLIE

Oh, there's one thing in there I

didn't like too well. That messiah

or dictator.

PRODUCER

That's our point of view, Governor.

And that's the way it stands.

WILLIE

All right, all right, that's the way

it stands... as of now.

FADE OUT

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

Hello, Lucy... How are you making

LUCY

I made some refreshments for your

SADIE

I'll help.

LUCY

(firmly)

No, thank you. Thank you kindly.

JACK

If you don't mind, Mrs. Stark... the

boys have to get back to make the

morning editions.

(to photographers)

Set 'em up on the porch, fellows.

We'll take some pictures out here,

first.

JACK

Mrs. Stark, please... All right,

fellows, take one down there, will

you please... Shoot it up this way.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

(on the last bite)

You're still a great cook, Lucy.

Great cook.

Well, I guess I better be getting

back to town. Nice to have spent the

day with the family.

(kisses Lucy on the

forehead)

Goodbye, Lucy.

(extends his hand to

Tom)

Tom.

TOM

(ignores the gesture)

Goodbye.

WILLIE

Take care of yourself, Pappy. Oh,

uh... how do you like the new radio

I got you?

(walks over to it)

You know how it works? You can get

police calls on it. Come here, come

here... I'll show you.

WILLIE

This one for police calls up here.

POLICE BROADCAST

Car sixty-two, proceed to five-

eighteen Oak Street. Tom Jones beating

his wife again.

WILLIE

All right, go ahead, go ahead.

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE

We interrupt this program to bring

you a special announcement. This

afternoon, the body of Richard Hale,

father of the girl who died in the

automobile accident involving the

governor's son, was found. A medical

examination revealed he was beaten

to death.

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE

The ugly charge of "official murder"

has been hurled at the administration

by a coalition of Stark's opponents,

led by Judge Stanton, lately an

outspoken critic of the

administration.

WILLIE

(to Jack)

Your friend, the Judge.

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE

Thus an almost forgotten incident

provided the spark that might set

off the explosion needed to rock

Willie Stark out of power. The latest

report is that impeachment proceedings

may be instituted...

WILLIE

How long will it take you to pack? I

want you to go back to Capital City

with me tonight.

LUCY

Why?

WILLIE

Because I need you.

TOM

What for?

WILLIE

(still speaking to

Lucy)

I'll explain all of that later. Now,

Lucy, do like I say.

JACK

I'll wait outside.

WILLIE

You stay right here, Jack. I want

you bear witness to what I've got to

say.

LUCY

(indicating Sadie)

She can be a witness too.

SADIE

(starting toward the

door)

I'm going back to the capital and

get hold of Duffy.

WILLIE

You stay right here, Sadie.

SADIE

Somebody's got to go back to the

capital. I'll go in the other car.

WILLIE

All right, then tell Duffy not to do

anything or say anything until I get

there.

SADIE

Yes, Governor.

TOM

Now he needs us. Now that he's in

trouble he needs us, so he can lead

us around like monkeys with rings in

our noses. So he can say to people,

look at me, feel sorry for me...

just a family man with a wife and a

crippled son...

WILLIE

(shouts)

Shut up!

LUCY

Willie!

TOM

Why don't you leave us alone?

WILLIE

Leave him alone. How many scrapes

have I gotten him out of? How many

girls?

LUCY

Willie, stop.

WILLIE

It's not him they're after. It's me.

How many halfwitted apes do you think

I'm going to have to pay to square

this one? What do you think this is

going to cost me?

LUCY

What do you think it cost him?

WILLIE

(in a broken voice)

A man builds for his son. That's all

he builds for.

LUCY

Willie!

(turns and goes into

Tom's room)

Tom... Tom.

WILLIE

Give me a drink, Jack.

WILLIE

She'll go.

PAPPY

No good, Willie. No good.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

SENATOR

Mr. Speaker, I offer a house

resolution. Whereas Willie Stark,

governor of this state, has been

guilty of incompetence, corruption,

and favoritism in office -- yes, and

other high crimes -- that he is hereby

impeached, and ordered to be tried

by the senate.

WILLIE

(as he meets Duffy)

What's the score?

DUFFY

They're lined up against you solid.

They had a meeting.

WILLIE

How do you know? Were you there?

DUFFY

Me? What would I be doing there?

WILLIE

Selling me out.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

How many votes have we got?

SADIE

(going through some

files)

Eleven.

WILLIE

We need twenty.

DUFFY

We might be able to dig up a few

more.

WILLIE

Yeah. Do you know how?

DUFFY

No.

WILLIE

Oh, Jack. Come here. What have you

got in your black book about that

old friend of yours?

JACK

Who do you mean?

WILLIE

You know who I'm talking about...

your old friend, the Judge.

JACK

If and when you need it.

WILLIE

If and when? I need it right now.

He's got four senators wrapped up in

his hip pocket. Come on, come on,

boy... what have you got?

JACK

I'm going to give him a break. If he

can prove it isn't true, I won't

spill it.

WILLIE

I ought to bust you, Jack.

JACK

I promised two people I'd do it this

way.

WILLIE

Who are they?

JACK

Myself... and someone else. It doesn't

matter who. I'm going to give him a

break.

WILLIE

All right, give him a break. But if

you got the facts, you got the facts.

The truth is sufficient... just like

it says in the Bible.

JACK

That's the way it's going to be.

WILLIE

All right, boy... I'll trust you.

Where are you going?

JACK

(on his way out)

I'll be around.

SADIE

Who else do you think he promised,

Willie?

SADIE

You'd be smart... play square with

him. You're going to need people

like us around.

WILLIE

(as he shuts his door)

Are you sure?

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

(voice over)

The chips were down, and Willie knew

it. He was fighting for his life. He

roared across the state making one

speech after another. And all of

them added up to the same thing...

"It's not me they're after, it's

you!"

JACK

(voice over)

Willie hollered foul. Willie knew if

you hollered long enough, hard enough,

and loud enough, people begin to

believe you. Just in case they didn't,

he organized spontaneous

demonstrations.

WILLIE

Tell the boys to get the hicks out.

Bring 'em in from the sticks, empty

the pool halls. Turn 'em out. Turn

the yokels out.

JACK

(voice over)

In case anyone hollered back, he

organized spontaneous slugging. Willie

pulled every trick he ever knew --

and added a few more.

JACK

Hey, Sugar!

(To Willie)

You'll never live to be impeached!

WILLIE

Boy, I'll live to be President...

WILLIE

I've got fourteen senators to vote

against impeachment. If I win, you're

out of politics.

SENATOR

(refuses to sign)

I'll do whatever the Judge says.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

(voice over)

And always the trail led to one

place... Burden's Landing... and the

Judge.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

You sure you don't want me to go in

with you?

JACK

I'm sure.

WILLIE

Well, hurry it up, boy. We've got

places to go.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

Judge, I beg you, as a favor to

yourself, to me... call up, release

your votes.

JUDGE

I made a mistake once, Jack... when

I resigned. It was too easy then,

just resigning, pulling out. No,

Jack, I've made my choice. I have

nothing more to lose.

JACK

Judge, you know what Stark is capable

of. Think it over. I'll leave now.

I'll come back tomorrow and we'll

talk about it again. You can give me

your answer then.

WILLIE

I can't wait until tomorrow. I'm a

very impatient man.

JACK

(rising)

I told you not to come in here.

WILLIE

(ignoring him)

Is it true, Judge, that you're behind

the impeachment proceedings?

JUDGE

Yes, it's true.

WILLIE

I wanted to hear you say it with

your own silver tongue.

JUDGE

Well, you've heard it. If that's all

you came to hear you could have saved

yourself a trip.

WILLIE

Mind if I pour myself a drink? How

about you, Judge, will you have one?

You better... You're going to need

it.

WILLIE

What'd he say, Jack?

JACK

You'll get your answer tomorrow.

WILLIE

Are you kidding? Did you show it to

him, or didn't you?

JUDGE

Show me what?

WILLIE

That's what I figured. Let's get

down to cases, Judge. Do you remember

a man with the name of Littlepaugh?

WILLIE

Remember the Fortune Electric Company?

JUDGE

Of course. I was their counsel for

over ten years.

WILLIE

Remember how you got the job?

JACK

How did you find out?

WILLIE

(hands the Judge some

papers)

Do you remember how you got the job?

WILLIE

You know, Judge, dirt's a funny thing.

Some of it rubs off on everybody.

How did you get the job, Judge?

Blackmail?

JUDGE

(to Jack)

I swear I never even remembered his

name. Isn't that remarkable, Jack? I

never even remembered his name. It's

all so long ago it's hard for me to

realize it ever happened.

WILLIE

Yeah. But it did.

JUDGE

Yes, it did. But it's difficult for

me to realize it.

JACK

For me too, Judge.

JUDGE

Thanks for that much.

WILLIE

Well, I guess you know what the next

move is, don't you?

JUDGE

Yes, I do. Jack Burden. Willie Stark's

hatchet man.

JACK

(to Willie)

I asked you... how did you find out?

JUDGE

This would never stand at law, not

for a minute. It happened over twenty-

five years ago, and you could never

get any testimony. Everybody is dead.

WILLIE

Everybody except you, Judge. You're

alive. And people think you're a

certain kind of man. And you just

couldn't bear for people to think

otherwise.

JUDGE

Ever since then I... I've done my

duty. I... I'm responsible for many

good things.

(looks at the papers

again)

But I also did this.

WILLIE

Yes, yes, you did.

JACK

Judge, I beg of you, call and release

your votes, for your sake.

JUDGE

You have tender sensibilities for a

hatchet man.

(goes to the door)

Good night, gentlemen.

WILLIE

How about my answer?

JUDGE

You'll have it in the morning.

WILLIE

I want it tonight.

JUDGE

In the morning. Good night, gentlemen.

JACK

How did you find out?

WILLIE

We've got a lot to do. It's getting

late, Jack. Let's get back to town.

JACK

You know we're through, don't you?

WILLIE

Aw, you don't mean that, boy.

STANTON

What are you doing here?

WILLIE

It's all right, doc. Just here to

discuss some politics with the Judge.

STANTON

Oh, I see.

(starts upstairs)

Well, good night.

WILLIE

Good night.

JACK

(to Anne)

Did you give him --

WILLIE

Wait a minute, Jack --

JACK

Answer me. Did you give --

DISSOLVE TO:

STANTON

Aren't you going back with him?

JACK

No.

STANTON

Why not? You belong with him. Jack,

how could you have done it? When

Anne brought me those papers she

told me you promised not to tell

Stark until...

JACK

Yeah. I know.

(walks away)

Well, I kept my promise.

STANTON

Anne? Anne?

FADE OUT

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE

From all over the state they're

streaming in. From the hill country

and farms, the lumber camps... by

boat, by train, by horse, and on

foot. Willie Stark's army.

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE

The state capital is filled with

rumors, one of which is that Stark

is planning to seize power by force.

As commander of the state militia,

he has --

JACK

Come in. The door's open.

ANNE

Jack...

JACK

What do you want?

JACK

(bitterly)

No, I want to see you cry.

JACK

Stop it!

ANNE

I called you. All afternoon I've

been calling you.

JACK

I know. I was here.

ANNE

You've got to tell Adam. You've got

to see him.

JACK

Tell him what?

ANNE

He knows about me and...

JACK

About you and Willie?

ANNE

(nods)

I tried to explain to him. I... I

tried to explain to him that it wasn't

the way he thought it was.

JACK

How was it, Anne? You tell me.

ANNE

He hit me, Jack. My own brother...

he hit me.

JACK

Your brother is an old-fashioned

man. He believes in his sister's

honor. Me, I'm a modern man.

(slams clothes into

the valise)

The twentieth-century type. I run.

ANNE

(rises)

I'm frightened, Jack.

JACK

For who? Your brother, or Willie?

ANNE

(quietly)

We're through.

JACK

Who's through with who?

ANNE

He called me this afternoon. He's

going back to Lucy. He said it was

better that way.

JACK

Better for who? Him.

ANNE

Both of us.

JACK

Did he tell you that too when he

asked you to betray the Judge? At

least I walked out on him.

ANNE

Oh Jack... help me, please, please.

Adam's all I've got left now. Oh,

Jack, if you ever loved me...

JACK

If I ever loved you.

(pause)

I'll go find Adam.

DISSOLVE TO:

COP

Where do you think you're going?

(recognizes Jack)

Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't recognize

you.

JACK

Do you know who Dr. Stanton is?

COP

Yes sir.

JACK

Did he try to come through here today?

COP

Haven't seen him, sir.

JACK

Well, can you check the other

entrances?

2ND COP

There's no other entrances today.

The other entrances are blocked off.

Orders are to take no chances.

COP

If you care to come inside and wait,

Mr. Burden, we can find you a seat.

JACK

No, thanks. I'll wait out here. If

Dr. Stanton shows up, let me know.

Pass the word along to the boys,

will you?

COP

Yes sir.

LOUDSPEAKER

All right now. Everybody... that

means everybody... let's let Willie

know we're here! All together: WE

WANT WILLIE. WE WANT WILLIE.

SPEAKER

We will first proceed to take the

judgment of the senate on the question

of the impeachment of the governor.

SENATOR

(rising)

Mr. Speaker, this is a farce to ask

us to vote in the face of the kind

of intimidation and pressure that

has been exerted here in the past

few weeks. Even that crowd outside,

yelling on cue, is part of that

pressure.

CROWD NOISE

We want Willie. We want Willie.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNOUNCER

Attention, please. Attention, please.

This is a special announcement from

Willie Stark to you people out there.

He doesn't want any one of you to

leave...

ANNOUNCER

He wants you to stay in front of

this state Capitol until the fight

is over. If you want Willie Stark to

win, stay where you are.

ANNOUNCER

Do you hear me... stay where you

are. Don't go away. Stay where you

are. Don't go away.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNOUNCER

Attention, please. Attention, please.

The balloting on the impeachment

proceedings against Governor Stark

has just ended. This is the result:

Willie Stark has won.

WILLIE

They tried to ruin me. But they are

ruined. They tried to ruin me because

they did not like what I have done.

Do you like what I have done?

WILLIE

Remember, it's not I who have won,

but you. Your will is my strength,

and your need is my justice, and I

shall live in your right and your

will. And if any man tries to stop

me from fulfilling that right and

that will, I'll break him. I'll break

him with my bare hands. For I have

the strength of many.

WILLIE

Hello, Jack boy, I'm glad you're

here. I knew you'd come back.

WILLIE

Oh, doctor, I'm very glad to see

you.

COP

Stand back, everybody. Stand back.

SUGAR BOY

(nearly crying)

D-does it hurt m-much, boss? D-d-

does it hurt much?

JACK

Anne, Anne... Where are you going?

ANNE

I don't know. Leave me alone.

JACK

To do what?

ANNE

I don't care.

JACK

No, that's too easy.

ANNE

I don't know, I don't know, I don't

know.

JACK

I do.

ANNE

Leave me alone, please.

JACK

No, no more.

ANNE

He's dead.

JACK

We're alive.

ANNE

My brother's dead.

JACK

We've got to go on living.

ANNE

How?

JACK

So that Adam's death has meaning, so

that it wasn't wasted. Anne, our

life has to give his death meaning.

Don't you see that? Look at those

people...

JACK

Look at them! They still believe in

him. And we've got to make them see

Willie the way Adam saw him, or

there's no meaning in anything...

anything.

POLICEMAN

Mr. Burden... the governor's asking

for you. You better hurry. He's going

fast.

JACK

(to Anne)

Will you wait here?

JACK

Will you wait here?

WILLIE

It could have been the whole world,

Willie Stark. The whole world...

Willie Stark. Why did he do it to

me... Willie Stark? Why?

FADE OUT

THE END
