SHOOTING DRAFT

ROLFE (V.O.)

This is the story of my older

brother's strange criminal behavior

and disappearance. We who loved him

no longer speak of Wade. It's as if

he never existed. By telling his

story like this, as his brother, I

separate myself from his family and

those who loved him. Everything of

importance -- that is, everything

that gives rise to the telling of

this story -- occurred during a single

deer-hunting season in a small town

in upstate New Hampshire where Wade

was raised and so was I. One night

something changed and my relation to

Wade's story was different from what

it had been since childhood. I mark

this change by Wade's tone of voice

during a phone call two nights after

Halloween. Something I had not heard

before. Let us imagine that around

eight o'clock on Halloween Eve,

speeding past Toby's, Route 29, comes

a pale green eight-year-old Ford

Fairlane with a police bubble on

top. A square-faced man wearing a

trooper's cap is driving the vehicle.

Beside him sits a child, a little

girl with a plastic tiger mask

covering her face. The man is driving

fast --

WADE

I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I

couldn't help it it's too late to go

trick-or-treating now. I couldn't

help it I had to stop at Penny's for

the costume. And you were hungry,

remember.

JILL

Who's fault is it then if it's not

yours? You're the one in charge,

Daddy.

WADE

(shakes cigarette

from pack)

Yeah.

JILL

Look. Those kids are still trick-or-

treating. They're still out.

WADE

Those are the Hoyts.

JILL

I don't care. They're out.

WADE

Can't you see... look out there.

Nobody's got their porch lights on

anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt

kids are just out to get in trouble.

See, they put shaving cream all over

that mailbox there. They chopped

down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little

bastards. Jesus H. Christ.

JILL

Why do they do that?

WADE

Do what?

JILL

You know.

WADE

Break stuff?

JILL

Yeah. It's stupid.

WADE

I guess they're stupid.

JILL

Did you do that when you were a kid?

WADE

Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really

mean. Me and my pals, me and my

brothers. It was kind of funny then.

Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows.

Stuff like that.

JILL

Was it funny?

WADE

To us it was.

JILL

But it's not funny now.

WADE

It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I

gotta listen to all the complaints

people make. I'm not a kid anymore.

You change.

JILL

I bet you did lots of bad things.

WADE

What are you talking about?

JILL

I just think you used to be bad.

WADE

No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir.

Where do you get this stuff? From

your mother?

JILL

No. She doesn't talk about you

anymore.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LARIVIERE

We're looking for the funniest

costume! And the scariest! And the

most imaginative! And the best costume

of all!

WADE

(nudges Jill)

Got here just in time. Go ahead.

Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a

prize.

WADE

Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you

still know.

JILL

I don't want to.

WADE

Why? Why not? You know these kids

from when you went to school here.

It hasn't been that long.

JILL

It's not that.

WADE

What then?

JILL

It's stupid.

WADE

It's fun.

JILL

(voice breaking)

I want to go home.

(Wade kneels down)

I don't like it here.

WADE

Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't

mess this up anymore than it's already

been messed up. Join the other kids.

Do that and before you know it you'll

be as happy as a goddamned clam.

LARIVIERE

Wade! And who's that tiger? Is that

Jill? Come and join us.

CUT TO:

WADE

What are you boys up to?

CHICK

Same old shit.

FRANKIE

You see the damage these little sons-

of bitches been raising tonight?

WADE

(to Jack)

You're going to have to move your

pickup.

JACK

I know.

CHICK

(offers whiskey pint)

Take a bite.

WADE

Don't mind if I do.

JACK

LaRiviere's having a hell of a time

in there. Master of fucking

ceremonies.

WADE

Where's that gun you were bragging

on today?

JACK

No brag. Just fact.

WADE

(admires gun)

Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?

(passes it to Frankie)

FRANKIE

Nice.

JACK

(to Wade)

See you got Jill tonight. How'd you

manage that?

WADE

(turns)

Don't forget to move your truck.

(walks inside)

CUT TO:

WADE

Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight

of you. I had to step outside for a

smoke. You find anybody you know

here? There must be some kids you

used to know from school. You want

to go tomorrow? See your old teachers?

Be more fun than hanging out with me

all day.

JILL

No.

WADE

No what?

JILL

(lifts mask atop head)

No I didn't see anybody I know. No I

don't want to go to school here

tomorrow. I want to go home.

WADE

You are home. There are lots of kids

you still know here.

JILL

I don't want to be here. Don't worry,

I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want

to go home.

WADE

(sighs)

Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what.

Tomorrow morning, you still want to

go home, I'll drive you down. I'll

get off work or something.

JILL

(pause)

I called Mommy.

WADE

What? You called Mommy? Just now?

JILL

Yes.

WADE

Jesus, why?

JILL

I... because I want to go home. She

said she'd come and get me.

WADE

Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn

half hour drive each way. Why didn't

you talk to me about it first?

JILL

See, I knew you'd be mad.

WADE

Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd

you tell her, for Christ sake?

JILL

I told her I wanted to come home.

Daddy, don't be mad at me.

WADE

Well, I guess I am. I planned this,

I planned all this, you know. I mean,

it's sort of pathetic, but I planned

it. You shouldn't have called your

mother.

(takes her arm)

C'mon, we're gonna call her before

she leaves.

CUT TO:

WADE

She's gone already!

(hangs up)

Gone already! Couldn't wait.

JILL

Yes.

WADE

That's all you got to say? "Yes".

JILL

Yes.

WADE

She won't be here for a half hour.

Think you can stand it that long?

JILL

Yes.

WADE

Where do you expect to wait for her?

Obviously downstairs with the other

kids isn't good enough.

WADE

Sit right there by yourself if you

want. Wait for her by yourself. That's

fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going

downstairs.

JILL

That's fine with me too. When Mommy

comes, tell her I'm up here.

CUT TO:

WADE

I thought I told you to move that

truck!

JACK

Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You

wanna toke?

WADE

(steps over)

You gotta be more careful about that

shit. Gordon or one of those guys

sees you smoking that wacky tabacky

around me they'll expect me to bust

you. And I'll be outta a job.

JACK

Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be

such a hardass. I know you got

problems, but everybody's got

problems.

(offers joint)

WADE

Not here.

JACK

Well, c'mon, then. Get in and we'll

take a little ride, my man.

CUT TO:

JACK

Got a job first thing in the morning,

first day of season. Saturday I'll

hunt for myself. Twombley something. -

Er --

WADE

Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official

from Massachusetts. You're lucky.

JACK

Don't know about lucky. The guy's a

full-blown asshole. Pay's good,

though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee

a kill, of course. Which I can do.

There's some monster bucks hiding

out up there.

WADE

How'd you get the job?

JACK

Gordon, he's always got some angle

working. He wants to keep Twombley

happy, I'm his boy.

HETTIE

What's wrong with you?

WADE

Toothache.

(to Jack)

You should get close to him. Make

yourself irreplaceable. Guy's loaded.

JACK

Like you and Gordon?

WADE

Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get

along without me.

JACK

(laughs)

Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you

quit him.

WADE

(laughs)

Right!

JACK

Bastard's got his high beams on.

WADE

(watching)

Shit.

HETTIE

What?

WADE

My ex-wife Lillian and her husband.

That was them in the Audi that just

passed us.

JACK

Audi's a good car.

HETTIE

What's she up here for?

WADE

Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me

and Jill had a little argument. Jack,

I got to get back, get back to town.

Move this thing, will you? See if

you can get back to the Town Hall

before they get there, okay?

JACK

Piece of fucking cake.

CUT TO:

WADE

Lillian!

LILLIAN

Where's Jill?

WADE

Me and Jill, we just had a little

spat. She felt kind of left out, I

guess, from not knowing some of the

new kids --

LILLIAN

Where is she now? Is she in the truck

with your friends?

WADE

She told me she wanted to wait for

you. Inside.

LILLIAN

While you went off for a few beers

with your friends? Is that Hettie

Rodgers there, with whatzizname?

WADE

Yeah.

LILLIAN

She's grown up some, hasn't she?

WADE

Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It

looks like you've won this fucking

round already, so lay off a little,

for Christ's sake.

WADE

Horner! Leave her be. This's got

nothing to do with you, so just act

like the chauffeur. Got it?

HORNER

Wade. Nobody wants any trouble.

WADE

I don't want her to go, Lillian.

LILLIAN

Don't cause a scene. No one's trying

to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it

any worse.

WADE

I'm not making it any worse. You

are. Me and Jill could've worked

this thing out. It's normal, it's

even normal for me to get a little

touchy about it. Believe it or not.

How do you think this makes me look,

treating her like some tragic victim

or something?

WADE

Just wait till we're through,

goddamnit!

WADE

Don't you say a word. I didn't hit

him. I'm not going to hit anybody.

MARGIE

New hat?

(no answer)

Jill's up, I see.

WADE

(vague)

For a while.

MARGIE

How's she doing?

WADE

Okay. She's fine.

MARGIE

You two want to do anything tomorrow

and need a third party, give me a

call, okay? I'm off.

WICKHAM

Like hell you are. Tomorrow's first

day of deer season. I'll need you at

least in the morning.

MARGIE

(shrugs)

Well, that's that.

NICK

(walks off)

Take care, Wade.

WADE

You be careful of that little bastard.

He's dying to get in your pants, you

know.

MARGIE

(laughs)

Don't worry. I can protect my virtue.

I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.

WADE

See you tomorrow, maybe.

MARGIE

You okay?

WADE

Yeah.

WADE

Tomorrow, Gordon.

LARIVIERE

Watch this snow. It's coming down

tonight.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WADE

(on phone)

Lugene? Wade. Hoya doin?

(fumbles for cigarette)

Look, I was wondering, with the snow

and all, if you got school today?

(lights cigarette)

How the hell do I know? You're the

principal. All I'm supposed to do is

direct traffic from 7:30 to 8:30.

(listens)

Yeah, okay, I'm sorry -- I only just

now saw it was snowing, that's all.

My whole day is fucked. I gotta plow

all day. If I don't get over to

LaRiviere's early enough, I'm stuck

with the grader. I was just hoping

you'd have called school off.

(beat)

You check the weather bureau?

(acquiesces)

Okay, I hear you. I'll be over in a

bit.

(hangs up)

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TWOMBLEY

It's not enough snow, not for tracking

the bastards. No advantage there,

kid.

JACK

Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know

where those suckers are. Rain or

shine, snow or no snow. I know deer.

We'll kill us a buck today.

Guaranteed. Before ten.

TWOMBLEY

Guaranteed, eh?

JACK

Yep. Right about now the does are

holing up in the brush piles. The

bucks are right behind them and we're

right behind the bucks.

(gestures to gun rack)

This gun gets fired before ten

o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or

not is more less up to you. I'll put

you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck

the first four hours of the season.

That's what you're paying me for,

ain't it?

TWOMBLEY

Damn straight!

JACK

Done much shooting with that rifle

yet?

TWOMBLEY

(eyes him)

Tell you what. You get me close to a

big buck by ten, kid, there's another

hundred bucks in it.

JACK

If you get it?

TWOMBLEY

Yeah.

JACK

You might not kill it.

TWOMBLEY

You think so.

JACK

You might gut-shoot it or cripple it

for somebody else to find and tag.

Can't guarantee that won't happen,

especially with a new gun. I may

have to shoot it.

TWOMBLEY

You take care of your end, kid, I'll

take care of mine.

JACK

Mmm.

TWOMBLEY

You understand what I'm saying? I

want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple

or whatthefuck.

JACK

I get it.

(disdain)

No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer

and you'll get him dead. And you'll

have him by coffee time.

TWOMBLEY

And you'll get your extra hundred

bucks.

JACK

(smiles)

Wonderful!

CUT TO:

LUGENE

Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong?

Why were you holding everyone up?

WADE

Did you see that sonofabitch in the

BMW? He could've killed somebody.

LUGENE

Did you get his number?

WADE

I know who it is.

LUGENE

Good. Who?

WADE

Mel Gordon.

LUGENE

I still don't understand --

WADE

From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in-

law -- he was driving. I know where

they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway.

The old man's out deer hunting with

Jack Hewitt, so they probably got

some big weekend party planned.

CUT TO:

JACK

Safety on?

TWOMBLEY

I'm okay.

JACK

Follow close. We'll cross the next

meadow.

JACK

I used to play ball.

TWOMBLEY

Yeah?

JACK

Drafted by the Red Sox.

TWOMBLEY

You played for the Sox?

JACK

Double A. New Britain.

TWOMBLEY

Oh.

JACK

Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come

out of New Hampshire since Carlton

Fisk."

TWOMBLEY

Really.

JACK

They said.

TWOMBLEY

Hmm.

JACK

The only difference between me and

that Clemens on TV is luck, shit

luck.

TWOMBLEY

What happened?

JACK

Ruined my arm. Brought me along too

fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking

arm, I used to think. Then I realized

it had to be somebody's fucking arm.

TWOMBLEY

Hey, Hewitt! Slow the fuck down!

JACK

Safety on?

TWOMBLEY

Yeah.

JACK

This way.

TWOMBLEY

(walking loudly)

Sun's gettin high.

JACK

(fingers to lips)

Deers have ears too.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LARIVIERE

Told you the snow was coming down.

Take the grader.

WADE

Where's the plow?

LARIVIERE

Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting

with Evan Twombley.

WADE

His son-in-law damn near killed me.

LARIVIERE

(hangs up)

Huh?

WADE

At the school crossing. In his BMW.

Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna

bust his ass.

LARIVIERE

Don't go playing policeman.

WADE

What am I -- a security guard? You

hired me, you and your Selectman

friends.

LARIVIERE

You don't want the extra police pay?

WADE

I'm not saying that.

LARIVIERE

Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's.

Don't let Lillian get to you. She

didn't belong here. That's why she

left.

WADE

Fuck you.

LARIVIERE

That's what I love about a small

town. You know everybody.

CUT TO:

JACK

Stay here, stand where I am.

JACK

Fresh tracks.

(sniffs)

Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck,

Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.

TWOMBLEY

You only got a little while if you

want your hundred bucks.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JIMMY

How's it goin?

WADE

Cold. How you think?

JIMMY

Sorry about that. Why's it every

year, come first snow, you get stuck

with the grader?

WADE

School. Traffic crossing.

(lights cigarette)

I gotta quit these things.

JIMMY

What we doing after? Wells?

(Wade nods)

Don't work too fast. Business the

way it is, Gordon's probably looking

to lay me off earlier than usual

this year. He's got too much money

as it is. Why's it always the little

guy that gets kicked in the butt in

hard times?

LACOY

...That was no pisser. I'll tell you

who was a pisser. Glen Whitehouse.

There was a real pisser. He was mean

normal, but when he drank it was

like he burst on fire. Canadian Club.

Always drank CC. One Christmas there's

this cord of wood out back he forgot

about and he decides to have his two

boys stack it. Except it's been out

back two months and it's snowed and

rained and froze so now the wood's

all iced in. He takes the boys. He

was drunk, of course.

CUT TO:

POP

Move it! Daylight in the swamps!

ROLFE

Pop, the kids are waiting for us.

WADE

(reproving)

Rolfe.

POP

A lesson in work and its rewards.

You'll thank me for this one day.

(to house)

Sally, turn off that TV!

WADE

(to Rolfe)

Just do it.

POP

Atta-go.

ROLFE

Please, Pop. Let's go back.

POP

What are you, a quitter?

CUT TO:

LONG-HAIRED LOCAL

(puzzled)

So what happened?

LACOY

Beats me. That's all I heard. Wade

would know more about it.

(calls)

Wade! We were just talking about

your Old Man. "What are you, a

quitter!"

WADE

Jesus, LaCoy, you got nothing better

to do than sit around and tell

stories. Pity is, some college student

will come some day and believe this

shit cause you're the only one dumb

enough to talk to him. Take care.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

POP

That was some job.

ROLFE

We'll work at it everyday, promise.

POP

I think we made the point.

WADE

(mumbles)

You just needed a drink.

POP

What was that?

(no answer)

You got something to say, say it!

Say it!

WADE

(soft)

Nothing.

POP

You no-good pup!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WADE

It don't look right.

NICK

What?

WADE

The sign. It looks like it's spelled

wrong or something.

NICK

Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people

like you that keep this fucking town

from prospering. Whatever somebody

does to improve things around here,

you gotta find fault with it.

WADE

I'm not finding fault. It's a good

idea, good for you, good for the

town. Real modern too.

NICK

This town sucks.

WADE

Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's

something wrong with "Home Made

Cooking", that's all. The sign's

fine. What it says is wrong.

MARGIE

Who needs it? Everybody who comes

here has been coming for years so

what they need a sign for?

MARGIE

You okay?

WADE

Yeah.

MARGIE

I'm sorry about what I said.

WADE

Said what?

MARGIE

About you and Jill and needing a

third person. She went back to

Lillian?

WADE

Forget it.

MARGIE

(touches his arm)

I'm sorry.

WADE

I'm going to start one of those

custody suits. I don't give a fucking

shit. You know?

MARGIE

You don't mean that.

WADE

Yeah. I mean that.

MARGIE

(arm around his

shoulders)

No you don't. You're pissed, that's

all. You ought to cool off for a few

days then have a long talk with

Lillian. You know? Work it out with

her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's

not out to get you.

WADE

The hell she isn't. Lillian's been

trying to nail me to a cross since

the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me

a fucking lawyer from Concord and

get this thing, this divorce thing,

rearranged. I've been thinking about

it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or

something. Nobody owns nobody,

especially not kids. And I pay her.

NICK

(calls)

Marg!

WADE

That goddamned woman. Thinks she can

cart Jill off and leave me alone

like this. I'm more than pissed,

Margie. I'm a whole lot more than

pissed. I been that plenty and I

know the difference. This is

different.

NICK

Marg! You got orders!

MARGIE

Call me.

WADE

(genuine)

Tonight. Let's get together.

MARGIE

Okay.

NICK

You talked to Jack?

WADE

Not since last night. He took a guy

hunting.

NICK

The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang!

That's what it sounds like. Not on

purpose. I assume accidental.

WADE

(shocked)

Jack?

NICK

The other guy.

WADE

Where... how'd you hear that?

NICK

CB. Little while ago. One of the

boys on the way in picked up Jack on

the CB calling for state troopers. I

figured you'd know what really

happened. The fucking guy kill

himself? This Twombley, who the fuck

is he, anyhow?

WADE

No, I... I've been out on the grader

all morning. Twombley's summer people.

Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's.

It was his idea for Jack to take him

hunting.

(suddenly engaged)

I gotta go.

NICK

He don't care for you.

MARGIE

Stop being jealous.

CUT TO:

LARIVIERE

What's the hurry?

WADE

A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.

LARIVIERE

Huh?

WADE

I figured you already heard.

LARIVIERE

(urgent)

Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving:

I got to get up there. How would I

know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take

my truck.

CUT TO:

LARIVIERE

Fuck. Turn it off.

(Wade does)

All you heard was there was some

kinda accident?

WADE

Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not

Jack. He's okay, I assume.

LARIVIERE

Fuck. You don't know how bad or

anything?

WADE

You mean Twombley?

LARIVIERE

Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out

that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

WADE

He more than likely just shot himself

in the foot or something. That's

what usually happens.

LARIVIERE

I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.

WADE

I wish you had. I'd rather be deer

hunting instead of freezing my ass

on that fucking grader.

LARIVIERE

You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he

can't drive the grader worth shit.

WADE

Like hell.

LARIVIERE

(frightened)

That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I

bet that was Twombley.

WADE

You want me to follow them to

Littleton?

LARIVIERE

Let's get to the top and talk to

Jack first. He'll know what happened.

He fucking better. If this coulda

been avoided, I'll put that kid's

ass in a sling.

CUT TO:

JACK

You heard the news.

LARIVIERE

I hear Twombley got shot.

JACK

Yeah.

BROWN

Watch the dog, Wade. Takes a mind

to, he'll tear your fucking head

off.

LARIVIERE

(to Jack)

Bad?

BROWN

Thirty-thirty at close range.

LARIVIERE

Jesus.

WADE

Will he make it?

BROWN

(shakes head)

D.O.A. Blew the bastard wide open.

Had a hole in back you could put

your head into. Pretty big hole in

front too. You could've put your

fist into that one.

LARIVIERE

(to Jack)

You see it?

JACK

Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart.

I spotted this buck, then I heard

the gun go off and Twombley was gone.

I looked over the little cliff we

was using for a stand and there the

fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it

right in.

LARIVIERE

This is gonna be one fucking mess to

clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and

daughter are up the weekend. Didn't

you say you'd seen him, Wade?

WADE

I seen 'em. Near ran me over.

BROWN

You wanna tell 'em, Gordon? You knew

the old man.

LARIVIERE

What the fuck. My day's already

ruined.

(to Wade)

Give me the keys. You can go back

with Jack. You still got a shitload

of plowing to do.

WADE

It ain't done, if that's what you

mean.

LARIVIERE

Something bugging you?

WADE

Yeah. A few things.

LARIVIERE

Well, right now we're not too

interested. Finish up what you gotta

do, then you can get bugged on your

own time.

LARIVIERE

(to Jack)

Might as well take the rest of the

day off. You look sort of fucked up.

You've been paid for the day, anyhow,

right?

JACK

Not exactly. I mean, he never paid

me.

LARIVIERE

You'll get your money. Don't talk to

any newspapers about this. Twombley's

a big deal down in Massachusetts,

you know. Tell them your lawyer says

you shouldn't comment.

JACK

Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do

I?

LARIVIERE

No, of course not. Just say it, that's

all.

WADE

Where'd Twombley get shot?

JACK

In the chest.

WADE

(offers cigarette)

No, I mean whereabouts.

JACK

(points)

A half mile in, along the old lumber

road.

WADE

You bring him up yourself? That's a

steep climb.

JACK

The ambulance guys lugged him up.

WADE

You stayed away?

JACK

Yeah.

WADE

Where'd you get the blood?

JACK

What blood?

WADE

On your sleeve.

JACK

Musta... How'd I know? What're you

doing, playing cop?

WADE

I gotta make a report to Fish and

Game. I was just wondering, that's

all. What'd he do, to shoot himself,

I mean?

JACK

Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or

something. I just heard the gun go

off.

WADE

I never seen a man shot before. Not

even in the service. Must be

something.

JACK

Well, I didn't actually see him do

it. Like I said.

WADE

Sure you did.

JACK

What?

WADE

Saw him do it?

JACK

What the fuck you telling me, Wade?

I never seen the guy get shot, I

told you that.

WADE

You musta seen him get shot. I know

you did.

JACK

Let's get the fuck outta here. You're

not making any sense, man.

WADE

There's your old twenty-gauge, and

that there's the new Browning you

was showing me last night. This must

be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very

fancy tooling. Probably fired one

time. It's a beautiful piece of work.

(touches it)

But what the hell, Jack, I guess you

deserve it. Right's right.

JACK

(starts engine)

Yeah.

WADE

Twombley sure as hell won't be

shooting it again.

JACK

He sure as hell won't.

CUT TO:

WADE

Rolfe.

ROLFE (O.S.)

Wade?

WADE

Yeah, brother, look, I was calling

cause -- has there been anything on

TV in Boston about a hunting accident

with a guy named Twombley, Evan

Twombley?

ROLFE (O.S.)

There was something. It happened up

your way.

WADE

Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was

with him. Maybe you do too. Jack

Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with

me. He's my best friend.

ROLFE (O.S.)

Wade, it's late. I know you're

probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed

reading. We got different habits.

WADE

No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm

calling because I need you to listen.

You're supposed to be a smart guy.

You're a professor. I got this theory.

Jack says he didn't see Twombley

shot but he did.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WADE

It'll come out Jack lied and the

kid'll get hung for it.

ROLFE (O.S.)

He was scheduled to testify for a

committee investigating organized

crime in New England and the

construction business.

WADE

Who?

ROLFE (O.S.)

Twombley.

WADE

No shit.

ROLFE (O.S.)

You think Jack shot him?

WADE

Well, it was an accident.

ROLFE (O.S.)

They were out deer hunting, right?

Jack probably heard the gun go off,

then came back and found the body.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WADE

Lillian was here. In Lawford.

ROLFE (O.S.)

Huh?

WADE

The night before the shooting.

ROLFE (O.S.)

How was she?

WADE

Picked up Jill. She was supposed to

visit for the weekend for Halloween.

She wanted to go home.

ROLFE (O.S.)

Who?

WADE

Jill. I was thinking of getting a

lawyer. Maybe you can help me.

ROLFE (O.S.)

What happened?

WADE

A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer.

You know, 'cause of Jill.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ROLFE (O.S.)

Don't think about it. You're

exhausted.

WADE

Yeah, I guess.

ROLFE (O.S.)

Get some sleep.

WADE

I get to feeling like a whipped dog

some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm

going to bite back. I swear it.

ROLFE (O.S.)

Haven't you already done a bit of

that?

WADE

No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've

growled a little, but I haven't bit.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MRS. GORDON

Who are you?

WADE

I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was

wondering, is your husband here?

MRS. GORDON

He's asleep. We were up very late.

WADE

Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that

I'm real sorry about your father,

Mrs. Twombley.

MRS. GORDON

Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.

WADE

Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just

had a little business to settle with

Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police

officer.

MRS. GORDON

Something about my father?

WADE

Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic

thing. No big deal.

MRS. GORDON

Can't it wait, then?

MEL GORDON

Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.

WADE

How's that?

MEL GORDON

I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'

WADE

Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I

come all the way to serve somebody a

summons, I don't call ahead for an

appointment.

MEL GORDON

What the hell are you talking about?

WADE

I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving

violation.

MEL GORDON

Moving violation! I just got out of

bed and you're telling me you're

giving me a goddamn speeding ticket?

Now? Are you nuts? Is that it,

Whitehouse? You're nuts?

WADE

(writing)

Yesterday morning, you passed a

stopped school bus, which was flashing

its lights, then you--

MEL GORDON

(stops Wade's arm)

Hold on!

WADE

(wrenches hand free)

Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr.

Gordon.

MEL GORDON

You're talking about a goddamned

ticket, from when I passed you at

the school where you were deciding

to hold up traffic while dreaming of

becoming a traffic cop or something?

WADE

Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon.

I'm just --

MEL GORDON

Doing your fucking job. I know. I

watch television too.

WADE

Yes. Here's your ticket.

MEL GORDON

(refusing ticket)

You get the hell out of my house

now, asshole. And know this -- you

are going to be a lucky asshole if I

haven't got you fired before the day

is out. I can do it with one phone

call, and I'm pissed enough to do it

now!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MARGIE

Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess.

More than most. But he'll be okay in

a few weeks.

WADE

There's something funny about that

shooting. There's lots funny about

it, actually.

MARGIE

I heard he was drunk at Toby's last

night and got in a fight with Hettie.

He drove off without her...

WADE

I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't

happen the way Jack says it did.

MARGIE

...Jack's turned into one of those

men who are permanently angry. He

used to be a sweet kid, but it's

like, when he found out he couldn't

play ball anymore, he changed. Now

he's like everyone else.

WADE

I've been wondering if maybe Jack

shot Twombley, instead of Twombley

shooting himself. I've been wondering

maybe Jack shot him on purpose.

MARGIE

Wade! How can you even think such a

thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that,

shoot Twombley on purpose?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WADE

Money.

MARGIE

Jack doesn't need money.

WADE

Everybody needs money. Except guys

like Twombley and that sonofabitch

son-in-law of his. People like that.

MARGIE

Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides,

who would pay him?

WADE

Lots of people. Guy like Evan

Twombley, Boston union official,

probably got lots of people want to

see him dead. The Government's been

investigating his links with the

Mafia.

MARGIE

(laughs)

The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?

WADE

No, I just know Jack's lying about

what happened. He just seemed -- I

know that kid, what he's like inside.

He's a lot like I was at his age.

MARGIE

You wouldn't have done anything like

that, shot someone for money.

WADE

No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd

given me half a damned excuse -- I

was pretty fucked up, you know.

MARGIE

(smiles)

But not now.

MARGIE

When you gonna get that tooth fixed?

WADE

I can see what you looked like as a

kid.

MARGIE

You knew me as a kid.

WADE

Yeah, but never what you looked like.

Not really. Never really studied

your face, like now. I was never

able to see you as a kid when you

were a kid until now, this way.

MARGIE

What way?

WADE

After making love. I like it. It's

nice to see that in a grown-up person.

MARGIE

It's nice.

MARGIE

Don't you think, do you still think

it's a good idea to press this custody

thing -- just now?

WADE

I'm her father -- supposed to be,

but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am.

It may be the only thing in my life

I've been so clear about wanting.

Even if it takes a big fight.

MARGIE

Then... I guess you have to.

WADE

(silence)

There's another thing I've been

thinking about. I don't know how you

feel about the idea, Margie, because

we've never talked about it. But

I've been thinking lately, I've been

thinking we should get married

sometime. You and me.

MARGIE

(uncertain)

Oh, Wade.

WADE

I've been thinking about it, that's

all.

MARGIE

You've been married twice --

WADE

It was to the same woman. I was just

a kid...

(Marg looks)

It's not like a marriage proposal or

anything, just a thought. Something

for you and me to talk about and

think about. You know?

MARGIE

Alright. I'll think about it.

WADE

Good.

CUT TO:

POP

I've got sons, Goddamnit, oh my God,

have I got sons! Wade? Rolfe?

Elbourne? You love me boys? Do you

love your Pop? Of course you do!

SALLY

Glen, stop --

POP

Oh, Jesus, Sally, you are such a

Goddamned good person! Capital G.

You are so much better than I am, I

who am no good at all, you who are a

truly good person, like a fucking

saint! Beyond fucking com-pare.

POP

My big boy bursting out of the seams

of his jeans!

SALLY

Don't!

POP

You little prick!

SALLY

Glen, stop!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MARGIE

Did you tell them?

(no answer)

That we were coming?

WADE

Don't you think it's proper for a

fella to introduce his girl to his

parents?

MARGIE

I know your parents.

WADE

I just want to pick up my divorce

papers. For the lawyer. It won't

take long.

CUT TO:

MARGIE

(getting out)

Are you sure they're home? Did you

call?

WADE

The truck's here. Looks like they've

stayed inside since the snow started.

WADE

Strange.

MARGIE

Think they're alright?

WADE

Of course! I would've heard.

MARGIE

How?

WADE

I don't know for Christ's sake!

CUT TO:

WADE

Pop, Pop, you okay?

WADE

Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the

cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?

POP

Sleeping.

WADE

You remember Margie Fogg?

POP

From Wickham's. Been a while. Like

some coffee?

WADE

How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen

you in town for a while.

POP

We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping.

You want me to get her?

WADE

Yeah.

WADE

(to Marg)

Jesus. Nothing's changed around here.

WADE

Where's Ma?

POP

She's coming.

MARGIE

Have you been heating the house? Not

just with the stove.

POP

There's a furnace.

MARGIE

You're not using it today?

POP

It's broke I guess. There's an

electric in the bedroom.

MARGIE

Maybe Wade should take a look at it.

Your pipes'll freeze.

(Pop nods)

Wade, would you do that?

WADE

Ma? It's Wade. Can I come in?

WADE

Oh, Lord.

POP

Coffee's perked.

MARGIE

When did she die?

POP

Is...? She's dead then?

WADE

Yeah.

POP

I checked on her. She had the electric

heater. Cold don't bother her as

much as me. Which is why I give her

the heater.

WADE

(kneels over mother)

Is there something wrong with the

phone?

POP

In the living room.

WADE

Why didn't you call and have the

furnace fixed?

POP

Wade. I thought she was alright.

Till this morning she was.

POP

It makes me sad.

MARGIE

Can --?

POP

(sits)

Makes me sad it was her. Instead of

me. I shoulda froze.

CUT TO:

ROLFE (V.O.)

Wade called me, as usual, late at

night. I knew it was Wade -- no one

else calls me at that hour -- and I

was ready to listen to another chapter

in one of his ongoing sagas. There

was the detective story concerning

the shooting of Evan Twombley and

the family melodrama about Wade's

custody fight with Lillian. But not

this time.

CUT TO:

ROLFE (V.O.)

Wade was telling a different story,

or so it seemed then, one in which I

myself was a character. He had called

to tell me that sometime the previous

night our mother had died, and he

had discovered the body when he'd

gone over to visit her and our father

with Margie Fogg. Pop was okay, but

kind of out of it. Worse than usual,

maybe, though no drunker than usual.

CUT TO:

WADE

(finishing a beer)

Shouldn't we get this show on the

road, now that Rolfe's here?

WADE

Pointless to stand around in church

with nothing to do, I guess.

ROLFE

What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing

her?

MARGIE

They'll be at the church and the

cemetery.

WADE

Anyone else want one? Rolfe?

ROLFE

No thanks. I don't drink.

WADE

Yeah. I forgot.

LARIVIERE

How you holding up, Wade?

WADE

I'm fine, fine.

LARIVIERE

You Rolfe?

(Rolfe nods)

I remember you from high school.

You're a teacher now? Harvard?

ROLFE

B.U.

LARIVIERE

I haven't seen you around. I don't

suppose there's much reason for you

to come this way.

REV. DOUGHTY

Come, Glen, join us. Let's kneel for

a moment of prayer before the service.

Wade? Rolfe?

ROLFE

Well...

WADE

This is nuts.

MARGIE

(reproving)

Wade.

REV. DOUGHTY

Dear Heavenly Father, Lord of Hosts,

we come to Thee to beseech Thy

blessings and commend to You the

soul of our beloved wife and mother,

Sally Whitehouse, to be one with You

and walk with You --

POP

...goddamned hair on her head.

POP

Not a one of you is worth a goddamned

hair on that good woman's head!

WADE

Pop! Don't do this now, Pop.

LARIVIERE

Maybe I'll head on over to the church.

REV. DOUGHTY

This is a difficult time.

WADE

Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.

POP

(raising fists)

Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no

big deal. Tell me how a single one

of you is worth a single hair on

that woman's head.

REV. DOUGHTY

Give up this demon.

POP

Go fuck yourself!

ROLFE

Wade, just leave it.

POP

(mocking)

Listen to your little brother. 'Wade,

just leave it.' Candy-asses. All of

you. That's what I've got for

children. Candyasses. 'Wade, just

leave it.' Praise the Lord! 'Just

leave it!'

WADE

If you ever touch her again, I'll

kill you. I swear it.

CUT TO:

ROLFE (V.O.)

The day of the funeral was almost

springlike. The snowline crossed New

Hampshire west to east, retreating

northward to Concord where it melted

by midmorning.

JILL

Dad.

WADE

(to Lillian)

I'm glad you're here. Can you stay

for a while?

WADE

You ever come to your father's grave

anymore?

LILLIAN

No, not anymore. It's too... it's

too far.

WADE

We should talk.

LILLIAN

We've done all our talking, Wade.

WADE

It's just...

LILLIAN

Let the past be.

(beat)

I'm sorry about your mother. I liked

her. You never know how much women

like that suffer. It's like they

live their lives with the sound turned

off -- and then they're gone.

JILL

(tugging at Lillian)

Mom.

LILLIAN

She has an ice-skating lesson at

four.

JILL

I'm taking ice-skating, Daddy!

CUT TO:

WADE

Let's dig out Pop's truck before the

skin of the snow freezes up.

CUT TO:

ROLFE

What about Margie?

WADE

What about her?

ROLFE

Well, do you still plan to get

married?

WADE

Yeah. She'll probably quit her job

and stay out here with Pop. We can't

leave him alone here, he'll set the

damn place on fire. With Jill here a

lot, it'll be good to have Margie

around. Things are going to change

in that department, by the way. I

got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm

gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's

gonna break loose, but it's worth

it.

WADE

I want to let the gas run out. I

don't want the bastard driving drunk,

and he's always drunk now. After,

we'll hide the keys.

ROLFE

Anything new about the shooting?

Twombley?

WADE

(reluctant)

I guess it was an accident, like

everybody thinks.

ROLFE

Want to know what I think happened?

WADE

Find them everywhere.

(swigs)

ROLFE

I think your first response to the

Twombley shooting was the correct

one.

WADE

Which is?

ROLFE

That it wasn't an accident.

WADE

Then who shot him?

ROLFE

Well, your friend, I think. Jack

Hewitt.

WADE

Motive. You gotta have a motive.

ROLFE

Money.

WADE

Who'd pay him that kind of money?

Not the mob. They got their own guys.

Specialists.

ROLFE

(agreeing)

They wouldn't deal with a guy like

Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley

is suddenly dead?

WADE

(swigs)

I don't know. You tell me.

ROLFE

Okay. It's likely there are people

in the union who don't want Twombley

to testify. They probably include

his son-in-law who's vice-president

and will probably be the next

president. I read that in the papers.

What's his name, Mel Gordon?

WADE

Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told

you about. I did, didn't I?

ROLFE

Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware

of illegal union loans or whatever,

starts nosing around cause of the

investigation and finds out. Finds

out his son-in-law is involved.

WADE

So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a

professional hit. That'd make the

feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.

ROLFE

A hunting accident is perfect.

WADE

Shit, around here, you shoot somebody

in the woods, you say it was an

accident, you get fined fifty bucks

and your hunting license lifted.

Jack's probably saying the guy shot

himself cause he ain't got his deer

yet and don't want his license pulled.

WADE

It's too neat. Things ain't that

neat. It makes me mad. That somebody

can pay to kill somebody, his own

father-in-law, and not be punished

for it. Don't that piss you off?

ROLFE

Not particularly.

WADE

Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you

care what's right?

ROLFE

I care about what happened. The truth.

I'm a student of history, remember?

ROLFE

I was thinking about that story you

told me, about Pop and chopping the

firewood out of the ice and after.

WADE

Yeah.

ROLFE

I hate to disappoint you, but I don't

think it happened.

WADE

Of course it happened. Why would I

lie about it?

ROLFE

It may have happened, but not the

way you said.

WADE

You think I wouldn't remember a thing

like that?

ROLFE

It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I

heard about it. When I heard about

it, it was about Elbourne.

WADE

We'd have to go digging in Vietnam

to ask him.

ROLFE

And Elbourne and Mom took you to the

doctor and told him you fell from

the hay loft.

WADE

(laughs)

Well, I never heard that one.

ROLFE

I remember clearly cause when I heard

I became real careful around Pop. I

was a careful child and I became a

careful adult, but at least I wasn't

afflicted by that man's violence.

WADE

(laughs again)

That's what you think.

ROLFE

I gotta head back. It's a long drive.

CUT TO:

LARIVIERE

Put out that fucking cigarette!

LARIVIERE

Not there, asshole. Flush it!

WADE

Morning, Gordon.

JACK

I'm fucking out of here.

WADE

Lawford?

JACK

Out of this fucking job. This job

sucks. Working outside in the winter

sucks.

JACK

Open the door, will ya?

WADE

Why don't you quit now, you want out

so bad?

JACK

Open the door. We're late.

WADE

I mean it -- you got enough money

now. Head out for California. Surf's

up, Jack, and you're digging wells

in the snow.

JACK

What do you mean I got money? I'm as

broke as you.

WADE

Looney Tunes, Jack. Fucking Looney

Tunes!

ELAINE (O.S.)

Mr. Gordon!

MEL GORDON

The boss in?

ELAINE (O.S.)

Yes indeedy!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WADE

I screwed up the divorce. I agreed

with everything she said. I wanted

her to like me. I just want to be a

good father.

HAND

It would help if you were married,

if there was someone at home while

you work.

WADE

I plan to. Soon.

HAND

How soon?

WADE

This spring.

HAND

Good. It would help if there were

some drug or alcohol abuse on the

part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems

upsetting to the child.

WADE

It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?

HAND

No, not exactly. I'll look at the

divorce decree, see if we can get it

redrawn. Interview your daughter.

Jill, right?

WADE

Yes.

HAND

Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You

can mail it.

WADE

Jesus. How much... how much will the

whole thing cost?

HAND

Hard to say. If we go for custody,

depositions, psychiatric evaluations,

it could drag on. Ten or twelve

thousand dollars. She could win on

appeal. If we just want to get the

visitation rights redrawn, assuming

they're unduly restrictive, it

wouldn't be more than twenty-five

hundred.

WADE

Oh.

HAND

(sensing situation)

You might be better off legally as

well as financially to just go for

the --

WADE

Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing

was just my getting back at her. I'm

not as dumb as I look. Whatever you

say. I love my daughter.

(Hand nods)

I'll send you the five hundred.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WADE

Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch

is going out again.

LARIVIERE

You ever think of getting a new car,

Wade?

WADE

On what you pay me?

LARIVIERE

Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have

him pick up Wade's car, fix the

clutch.

ELAINE (O.S.)

What!

LARIVIERE

(to Wade)

Use the pickup. I'll bill it to the

town. You're the town police officer

and the town police officer should

have a decent car. You want a new

car or not?

WADE

What do I have to do for it?

LARIVIERE

Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking.

You don't get enough appreciation

around here and it's time we changed

things a little.

WADE

I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.

LARIVIERE

So?

WADE

He say anything about the summons I

tried to give him? Sonofabitch

wouldn't accept it.

LARIVIERE

Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out

right after the man's father-in-law

shot himself. Let it go. Call it a

favor to me.

WADE

You? Why?

LARIVIERE

Mel's doing some business with me.

It's nice to do favors for people

you do business with. He was in a

hurry. No big deal.

WADE

That was before Twombley was shot.

Before he knew.

LARIVIERE

What's the difference? Take my truck,

take a rest -- stop worrying about

Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to

do with your old man's place -- he

going to stay there?

WADE

(takes out cigarette)

Want to buy?

LARIVIERE

Don't light that in here. I'm

allergic.

WADE

I won't. You interested?

LARIVIERE

Maybe.

WADE

You and Mel Gordon?

LARIVIERE

Could be.

WADE

(voice rising)

Always count on old Wade for a good

screwing. Why should I always pay

more, sell cheap? Why should you

guys make all the money. You and Mel

and Jack. Right's right.

LARIVIERE

(waving arms)

Out! Out!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JACK

You crazy sonofabitch! You'll sink

us both! Get off the fucking ice!

Get off!

JACK

I'll shoot you, Wade, I swear it!

I'll fucking shoot you dead if you

don't move away from that truck!

JACK

Don't move! I'll shoot you dead if

you move!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NICK

Your father's in back, Wade. Marg

had to babysit him. She moved in

with you, huh?

(looking closer)

What happened?

POP

Ah, the prodigal son.

NICK

About fucking time.

POP

Look, got me a new job, second cook

and bottle washer!

MARGIE

What happened?

WADE

Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I

got waylaid. Sorry.

POP

The fuck you got waylaid. You follow

your prick around like it was your

nose.

NICK

(enters)

Can it, Whitehouse.

(to Wade)

Get him out of here. It was funny at

first, but I'm tired.

MARGIE

There's clothes in the back.

POP

Let's go home? What home is that?

Your home? My home? Let's have a

talk about that. You're fucking sly,

Wade. Your mother's dead so she can't

make any excuses for you anymore!

You gotta deal with me! No more sugar

tit, asshole.

WADE

Pop, for Christ's sake!

POP

You think you can take me now? Come

on, try.

NICK

Marg, get out of this. Fast.

MARGIE

I can't.

CUT TO:

WADE

I wish you would die.

MARGIE

Stop it! Stop it! Just stop it!

CUT TO:

WADE (O.S.)

No shit, Rolfe, I glanced up and

there he was, only it was me. But it

was like I had never seen myself

before. It was a stranger's face.

Hard to explain. You fly on automatic

pilot, like I was doing all night,

and you disappear.

CUT TO:

WADE

Then you accidentally see your body,

or your face, or whatever, and you

don't know who the hell it belongs

to. Strange. It's the business with

the old man, I know, and how

incredibly pissed I was at him, and

also chasing Jack Hewitt like that,

and the Goddamned truck going through

the ice, not to mention Margie's

being so upset -- one thing on top

of another.

ROLFE (O.S.)

Wade, are you alright?

WADE

But you gotta hear this. You won't

believe it. Mel Gordon had come by

to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in

his office.

CUT TO:

LARIVIERE

He's on to us!

JACK

Shit! What are we gonna do?

LARIVIERE

Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta

talk to Mel.

JACK

You can't buy Wade off.

LARIVIERE

We bought you.

JACK

That was me.

CUT TO:

ALMA

Wade! Come in! Have a cup of coffee.

CUT TO:

WADE

You got yourself a computer, Alma.

ALMA

Been putting my files into it. You

take sugar and milk?

WADE

No. Black.

ALMA

Are you alright, Wade?

WADE

Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned

tooth, I got a few things bugging

me, like everybody else. But I'm

okay.

ALMA

Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't

mean to pry. I'm sorry about your

mother. It was a nice funeral.

WADE

Alma, I think there's some dirty

business going on in this town.

ALMA

Always has been.

WADE

This is maybe worse than you and I

are used to.

(beat)

What I'm talking about, I'm talking

about murder. Among other things.

ALMA

Who?

WADE

Evan Twombley, the union boss who

got shot. Somebody murdered him.

ALMA

Who?

WADE

You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work

with?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WADE

...if Jack told the truth, he could

be free by the time he's my age.

ALMA

Sometimes things are simpler than

you think. Let me ask you a question.

WADE

You don't believe me?

ALMA

(crosses to her desk)

About Jack? No. Have you checked out

the tax bill on your father's farm

lately?

WADE

I know he's due for the last two

years. I was thinking of paying it

when the insurance comes in.

ALMA

Has anybody offered to buy it?

WADE

As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.

ALMA

This is all the real estate

transactions in this town the last

year. Most of it unused land. Most

of it for little more than the back

taxes owed.

ALMA

This is from three years ago. Some

difference, huh?

WADE

(looking)

What is the Northcountry Development

Association?

ALMA

I went down to Concord to check it

out. The president is Mel Gordon.

The vice-president and treasurer is

Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are

buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000

this year. I believe that's out of

LaRiviere's league.

WADE

Twombley involved?

ALMA

No.

WADE

He musta found out. They had to get

rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.

ALMA

All the figures show is that Gordon

LaRiviere is going to be a very rich

man using his position as Selectman.

In a year or two, you won't recognize

this town.

CUT TO:

WADE

You sneaky sonofabitch! I've got

your number now, Gordon! All these

years I actually thought you were a

decent man.

(pounds fists on desk)

Can you believe that?

LARIVIERE

Wade, you're done.

(extends hand)

Let me have the shop keys.

WADE

(to Jack and Jimmy)

You two, don't you get it? He's using

you. You're his slaves.

(soft)

Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see

that?

LARIVIERE

The key, Wade.

WADE

Yeah, you can have the key. It's the

key that's kept me locked to you all

these years. I give it to you with

pleasure.

(passes key)

Now I'm free. See how easy it is,

Jack? All you got to do is give back

what the man gave you, and you're

free of him.

(turns to leave)

I've got to call my brother.

WADE (O.S.)

I know what it means. I'm just running

out of ways to use it.

ROLFE (O.S.)

For what?

CUT TO:

WADE (O.S.)

To help, Jack, of course -- and to

nail those sonsofbitches, the Two

Gordons. That's what Alma calls them.

Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?

ROLFE (O.S.)

Take care of the little things first,

the things that are distracting you

from taking care of the big things.

Call Chub Merritt, get your car back,

call a dentist, for God's sake, and

get your tooth pulled, don't trust

the locals, get your facts straight

and go straight to the state police.

Let them work on this.

CHICK

The good news is we haven't got to

your car yet. The bad news --

WADE

Just tell me when you'll have it

fixed.

CHICK

-- the bad news is there's a problem

with Gordon's truck what somebody

drove through the ice last night.

Figured you'd know something about

that, Wade.

WADE

(beat)

Yeah. I know about that.

CHICK

LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay

for the fixin' of your car. A couple

hundred for the clutch. I got some

more bad news. Wanna hear it?

WADE

Tell me.

CHICK

Chub says you're fired.

WADE

He can't fire me. LaRiviere already

did that this morning.

CHICK

He's a Selectman. The town. He said

to tell you to turn your badge in

and clean out your office. I'm

supposed to pull the CB and police

light out of your car. They're town

property.

CUT TO:

WADE

What do you mean, you can't take me

today? I told you --

MARGIE

What on earth is happening to you?

Why are you acting this way?

WADE

It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I

can't even think anymore because of

it.

MARGIE

I heard you talking. You got fired

this morning, didn't you?

WADE

Look, that's temporary, believe me.

There's so much shit gonna hit the

fan the next few days, my getting

fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't

matter a bit.

WADE

I'll get another job. People are

going to need me. After this is over,

they'll make me into a Goddamned

hero. You wait: you'll see, I'll

deliver. I'll be the best father who

ever lived. You need me, even Pop,

for Christ's sake, he needs me. This

town needs me. Maybe now they think

they can send me howling into a corner

like a kicked dog, but my God, it'll

be different soon.

WADE

Leave the bottle out!

ROLFE (V.O.)

You will say I should have known

terrible things were about to happen,

and perhaps I should have. But even

so, what could I have done by then?

Wade never went inside. He lived

almost wholly out there on his skin,

with no interior space to retreat

to, even in a crisis.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LILLIAN

Wait there. She'll be right out.

(looks back)

Is there snow on the ground up in

Lawford?

WADE

Yeah, lots.

LILLIAN

(to Jill)

See. Get your boots.

WADE

Hi honey.

JILL

(going back inside)

Hi.

LILLIAN

Have her back tomorrow night by six.

WADE

No problem. Look, I...

LILLIAN

You make me sick. I can't believe

you've sunk so low.

WADE

Low as what? What have I done? It's

bad to want to see your own daughter?

LILLIAN

You know what I'm talking about. For

what you're doing to me and to the

child you say you love so much. Love.

You won't get away with it.

LILLIAN

Bye, honey! Call me tonight if you

want.

JILL

Are we going in this?

WADE

Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll

be fine.

JILL

It's pretty old.

WADE

It belongs to Pop.

JILL

Pop?

WADE

Grandpa. My father. It's his.

JILL

Oh.

CUT TO:

WADE

(winking)

How about a Big Mac?

JILL

Mommy won't let me eat fast food.

You know that. It's bad for you.

WADE

C'mon, we can always sneak a Big

Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your

favorite. What do you say?

JILL

No.

WADE

What do you want, then?

JILL

Nothing.

WADE

You can't have nothing, Jill. We

need lunch. Mr. Pizza?

JILL

Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --

WADE

I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge

today, though.

JILL

Okay. So we'll get what you want.

What do you want?

WADE

Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait

till we get home. Maybe we'll stop

by Wickham's for a hamburger when we

get to Lawford. That suit you? You

always like Wickham's.

JILL

(looking ahead)

Okay.

WADE

Fine.

WADE

Oh, Jesus, Jill, I'm sorry. What's

the matter, honey?

WADE

Please don't cry. Please, honey.

JILL

(regains composure)

What are you sorry for?

WADE

I don't know. For the food business.

I guess. I just thought, you know,

we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like

we used to.

JILL

I want to go home.

WADE

(quick)

You can't.

JILL

(quiet)

That's illegal, you know.

WADE

I know.

JILL

You're a policeman.

WADE

Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing

anymore.

JILL

Oh.

CUT TO:

WADE

Jillie, you want a cheese grilled

sandwich?

NICK

It's called a grilled cheese sandwich,

you dub.

WADE

Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing

happened.

JILL

I want to go home.

WADE

(rigid)

Okay, let's go home, then.

NICK

(delicate)

Wade, I got a message for you.

(Wade turns)

Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you.

Wants you to clear your stuff out of

his office in Town Hall.

WADE

His office. You mean my old office.

NICK

Well, I guess -- that's what he said.

WADE

He got his deer yet?

NICK

No, he's out now. Somewhere on the

mountain. I'd stay away from him if

I were you. He's real pissed.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WADE

Going somewhere, Margie?

MARGIE

I'm just cleaning out some of this

stuff that's built up. For the rummage

sale. And some things for the

cleaners. And the laundromat.

WADE

Don't lie to me. You're leaving me,

I can see that.

MARGIE

Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.

WADE

(hurt)

Marg.

MARGIE

(crying)

Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

JILL

Leave her alone! Leave her alone!

MARGIE

(to Jill)

Get in.

JILL

I want to go home. Will you take me

home?

MARGIE

Yes.

POP

(Satanic delight)

You! By Christ, you -- I know you.

(points bottle)

Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I

know you. You're a goddamn fucking

piece of my heart!

WADE

(dead)

You don't know me. You don't know

me!

(beat)

So fuck you. Fuck you.

POP

Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally

done it! Like a man done it. Done it

right. I love you, you mean

sonofabitch!

WADE

Love! What the fuck do you know about

love?

POP

Love! I'm made of love!

WADE

Call it what you want.

POP

Everything you know is from me.

WADE

Yeah.

POP

Bang!

WADE

You and me.

POP

Where the Christ you going? You

sonofabitch, you leave my fucking

truck where it is! I need... Give me

the Goddamn keys! I need to get me

to town!

WADE

Crawl!

POP

Nothing in the fucking house to drink.

Not a fucking thing. My house, my

money, my truck -- stolen!

WADE

I don't know you. My goddamn father

and I don't know you.

CUT TO:

WADE

I know you now. I love you too.

WADE

(smiles)

Joke. You scared me.

CUT TO:

ROLFE (V.O.)

The historical facts are known by

everyone -- all of Lawford, all of

New Hampshire, some of Massachusetts.

Facts do not make history. Our

stories, Wade's and mine, describe

the lives of boys and men for

thousands of years, boys who were

beaten by their fathers, whose

capacity for love and trust was

crippled almost at birth and whose

best hope, if any, for connection

with other human beings lay in an

elegiac detachment, as if life were

over.

CUT TO:

ROLFE (V.O.)

It's how we keep from destroying in

turn our own children and terrorizing

the women who have the misfortune to

love us; how we absent ourselves

from the tradition of male violence;

how we decline the seduction of

revenge.

ROLFE (V.O.)

Jack's truck turned up three days

later in a shopping mall in Toronto.

Even without the footprints, the

bullet, Wade's utter disappearance

seemed evidence enough of his guilt.

CUT TO:

ROLFE (V.O.)

LaRiviere and Mel Gordon were indeed

in business. The Parker Mountain Ski

Resort is now advertised all across

the country. Jimmy Dame tends bar at

the lodge. Chub Merritt opened a

snowmobile dealership, Nick Wickham

runs the new Burger King. Margie

Fogg moved to Littleton, nearer her

mother; Lillian and Jill went with

Bob Horner to a new job in Seattle.

ROLFE (V.O.)

We want to believe Wade died, died

that same November, froze to death

on a bench or a sidewalk. You cannot

understand how a man, a normal man,

a man like you and me, could do such

a terrible thing. Unless the police

happen to arrest a vagrant who turns

out to be Wade Whitehouse -- or maybe

he won't be a vagrant; maybe he will

have turned himself into one of those

faceless fellows working at the video

store and lives in a town-house

apartment at the edge of town until

his mailman recognizes him from the

picture at the post office -- unless

that happens, there will be no more

mention of him and his friend Jack

Hewitt and our father. The story

will be over. Except that I continue.

THE END
