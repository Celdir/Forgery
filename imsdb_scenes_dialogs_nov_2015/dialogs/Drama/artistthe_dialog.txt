THE ARTIST

Written by

Michel Hazanavicius

Silent film, illustrated musically, with some title cards to

indicate the dialogues, with actors whose lips move when they

speak although we never hear their voices. The images are in

black and white, in format 1.33.

1   TITLES                                                       1

The letters of the titles come up on a title card typical of

the 1920s. Elegant motifs around the edge of the frame, and,

in the background, there are geometrical shapes reminiscent

of the light beams of a film premiere. Behind is a stylized

town. The titles end in a fade to black. On black, the date

appears on the screen: 1927

2   INT. LABORATORY - DAY                                        2

In a "futuristic" 1920s laboratory, a man in tail coat and

bow tie is being tortured. Ultrasound is being piped into his

ears. It's incredibly painful! He's screaming.

Title card:

I'm not telling!   I won't talk!!!

His torturers, cold men of science in white coats, gradually

increase the volume. The pain seems unbearable, the volume

reaches level 10 (maximum), the man passes out!

3   INT. CELLS & CORRIDORS - DAY                                 3

Guards wearing long leather overcoats throw the man into a

cell!

As the man is lying there on the ground, a dog wiggles

through the bars at the window. The dog, a Jack Russell,

jumps on top of the man - visibly his master - and begins to

lick his face. The man opens one eye! When he sees his dog,

he can't help cracking a smile...

The man, now on his feet, looks in pain. Despite the pain, he

motions to his dog who begins to bark in lively fashion.

Outside the cell, the guard looks curious about the noise. He

goes to the door, opens the spy flap and finds himself face

to face with the man, eye to eye just a couple of inches

apart! The man moves his eyes in such a way that he

hypnotizes the guard! Superimposed on the screen: a spinning

black and white spiral, until the dazed guard take his keys,

opens the door and releases the man and his dog.

2.

The man (the hero, thus) imprisons the guard without harming

him, then runs over to the guard's desk. His ears are still

causing him pain, but he opens a drawer and takes out his

belongings: a top hat which he snaps open, and a mask, which

he puts over his head to conceal his eyes.

We catch up with the masked man walking down corridors. He

suddenly stops, copied by his dog who follows him like his

shadow. The man, on his guard, has spotted another guard

where two corridors meet.

With a look, he orders his dog to move forwards into the

guard's line of sight. The guard looks over at the animal.

Using his fingers, the hero pretends to shoot his dog. The

dog collapses, plays dead. The guard, increasingly curious,

gets to his feet. He slowly approaches the motionless dog.

When he comes close he is attacked from the side by the hero,

who quickly puts him out of action with a mere punch!

The masked man then rushes to another cell, and releases a

young female prisoner. She too is wearing evening dress. As

she is thanking him he staggers and clutches his ears in

pain. She's concerned.

Title card:

Can I help you in some way?

He refuses.

Title card:

No. I don't get helped.   I give the help around here.

He composes himself. She casts him an admiring glance. Then,

in view of the urgency of their situation, they escape at a

run.

4   EXT. HOUSE/LABORATORY - DAY                                       4

They come out of a house that is lost in the hills, climb

into a Bugatti sports car that the man starts by rubbing two

wires together, and speed off.

5   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                                   5

The car speeds along the road. Its occupants turn round to

check they aren't being followed.

3.

6   INT. HOUSE/LAB - DAY                                           6

The guard who got knocked out picks himself up, realizes what's

happened and dashes over to his office. He grabs a radio

emitter and begins sending a message.

7   EXT. AIR FIELD - DAY                                           7

The hero, the young woman and the dog come to a halt in the

Bugatti on the air field, by a telegraph pole whose wires

lead...to a watch tower.

In the watch tower, a radio receptor is vibrating. A soldier

approaches, listens and suddenly understands! He grabs hold of

his gun and goes out onto the air field, only to find the

fugitives! He tries to shoot at them as he draws closer, but

the hero manages to throw an airplane propeller at him, before

climbing inside where the woman and dog are waiting for him.

The airplane begins to move.

The soldier shoots.

The airplane is positioning itself on the runway, while the

soldier continues to fire!

The aircraft gains speed.

The soldier is still shooting, but too late, as the heroo pulls

back the joystick, and the airplane takes to the sky...

The soldier is furious, but the hero is all smiles as he looks

back towards the ground and shouts something.

Title card: Free Georgia forever!!!

The airplane flies away into the evening sky.

8   EXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT                                          8

A little later in the night, still at the controls, the man is

fighting not to fall asleep. Behind him, the women is sleeping,

the dog is lying in her arms. Suddenly she is awoken by

explosions happening close by! Pandemonium! The man doesn't

understand it either, he tries to pick up altitude, but quickly

notices that the explosions are in fact pretty and

inoffensive. He consults a calendar dial on the control panel

that shows it is July 14th, immediately understands, and

bursts into laughter.

Title card: We've arrived, welcome to France!!!

Title card: The name is Miller.    Peppy Miller!

She finishes with an exaggerated wink, before walking on,

leaving behind the impassive butler.

16A   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                            16A

In the lobby, George is preparing to leave the house. He

waves at the huge, full-length portrait of himself waving and

smiling whilst wearing a tuxedo. He looks great in the

painting, and George is delighted to see and to wave to

himself.

16    EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY                                 16

Later, George, in a luxurious car driven by his chauffeur,

arrives at the Kinograph studios with his dog. The guard at the

entrance smiles broadly at them and waves.

17    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY       17

As he walks towards his dressing room, everyone smiles at him.

He's not always fooled by these signs of respect, and apes a

few smiles himself.

18    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY        18

In his dressing room, wearing a tailcoat and top hat, George

is finishing putting his make up on. He has a white face and

dark lips and eyes. His chauffeur is signing autographs for

him on full length photographs of himself (George) with his

dog. George says to him:

Title card: Go and buy a piece of jewelry for my wife. A nice

piece, to make it up to her.

The chauffeur nods. Having finished his mask up, George,

picks up a photo, looks at it closely and then writes on it.

As he leaves the dressing room, we see the photograph. He's

written Woof Woof on it, and signed it with the paw print of

a dog.

19    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - RESTAURANT DECOR SET - DAY          19

We're on a film set, the crew is setting up a shot. The

director is unhappy with a screen positioned behind a bay

window and he sends it off.

9.

Title card: Remove that screen and bring me another one!    On

the double!

Two hands pick up the screen and carry it away. George

arrives on set, everyone smiles at him. He sits down on the

chair which bears his name. The producer whom we saw the

previous day at the premiere arrives. His name is Zimmer, and

he's flanked by - and followed around at every moment by -

two secretaries and two assistants. One of them hands him The

Hollywood Reporter, and Zimmer, before he's even come to a

halt, talks to George as he shows him the front page. He is

visibly upset. George looks a lot more relaxed, he says hello

and vaguely tries to reassure him. But Zimmer persists, still

pointing at the newspaper.

Title card: Because of this childish nonsense, there's

nothing about the film before page 5!

Behind George, the two set hands come back with a new screen

of sky scenery, and wait, standing just next to George. As

they are holding it, there is a three foot gap underneath.

While the producer is talking to him, George's attention is

drawn by a lovely pair of women's legs that have come to

stand behind the screen, the top half of the body being

hidden by it. George acknowledges the sight with a smile and

is about to bring his attention back to the on-going

discussion, when his attention is drawn away again by a

noise, that of the tap steps the female legs are making,

presumably as a warm up. George smiles in recognition and

responds with a few tap steps of his own. The women's legs

instantly stop, seem to think a moment and then answer back,

but with a jump in the complexity of the steps. A tap

dialogue ensues between the two pairs of legs, until the set

hands - the path before them now cleared - pick up their

screen of scenery and walk off with it. The screen moves away

and as it disappears reveals that the upper body belongs to a

young woman. She pulls a face meaning 'Here I am!!' And of

course it's Peppy, except that she immediately realizes who

she is dealing with - visibly she wasn't expecting this at

all - and feels completely ridiculous and uncomfortable.

Her joyful expression gradually becomes one of abject

apology, but George is roaring with laughter.

After a short pause, Zimmer makes the connection. He checks

the front page of the paper, and recognizes her!

Then he begins shouting at her and all she can do is lower

her head, unable to reply. He gestures that she's fired and

for her to get out, and she starts to go, completely

distraught. She's just made a couple of steps when George

stops her and tells her to come back. Everyone is surprised,

most of all him. Zimmer can't believe it, and so doesn't

respond at first.

The car pulls into the hospital courtyard.

100   INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY AND STAIRS - DAY                      100

Peppy bursts into the lobby, talks to a woman at the desk who

directs her with a raised hand that Peppy immediately follows.

She bounds up the stairs four at a time and comes into a

corridor,

101   INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR AND GEORGE'S ROOM - DAY            101

and then to a door through the window of which she sees

George lying down. His dog is at the foot of the bed, asleep.

George is on a drip, unconscious and covered in bandages. A

doctor is in the room with a nurse.

Peppy enters. She's anxious but the doctor seems reassuring.

Title card: He's not in any danger now. He just needs to

rest.

Peppy goes up to George. She notices that his burnt hands

seem to still be clutching something. She's intrigued. In

response, the doctor shows her the reel of film that sits in

a corner of the room.

Title card: He was holding that. It was real hard to pry it

away from him.

Peppy picks up the can. The label is too damaged to be able

to read the title of the film. She opens it and unrolls some

of the film in front of the window. We see random photograms

run by. It's the only sequence they ever shot together, years

before. Peppy is moved. Without turning round, she asks the

doctor:

Title card: Do you think he could come rest up at my place?

The doctor nods with a kindly glint in his eye.

Title card: It's probably the very best he could have hoped

for.

102   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    102

An ambulance takes George, still unconscious, to Peppy's

house. Jack is with him.

34.

It's a large, beautiful house, very expensive and very

Hollywood. But it's also very inviting.

103   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM & CORRIDOR - NIGHT    103

It's night time. George is in bed. He opens one eye. Then he

wakes up and looks around, not understanding where he is.

Jack wakes up and barks, wags his tail. A nurse who had been

dozing in an armchair facing the bed awakes with a start, then

goes over to George. She reassures him, motions to him not to

get upset, then slowly leaves the room before running off down

the corridor. She knocks at a door then goes back to George's

room. Peppy is close on her heels. She comes into the room in

her nightgown. When he sees her, George smiles and she rushes

over to the bed and puts her arms tight around him. She is

terribly moved but, when she releases him from her arms to talk

to him, she realizes that he has lost consciousness again and

so was not sharing the same special moment as she. She pulls a

face, afraid she might have done something wrong, glances over

at the nurse, then lays George's head back on his pillow.

104   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - DAY                 104

The next morning, Peppy brings breakfast into George's room

and they eat it together. She laughs, talks, eats, drinks and

is as vivacious as he had dreamed she would be all those years

before. He looks at her with a smile on his face. Then she

looks at her watch and realizes she needs to hurry.

Title card: I've got to go. I have to be on set for nine

o'clock.

George smiles kindly at her. She returns the smile but we can

tell that maybe reality has just reminded them that she is

working, and he is not. They exchange a last glance before

she leaves the room.

George, now alone, gets up with some difficulty. He picks up

a pile of folded clothes from an armchair. It's his jacket

and pants, both half burned. On the floor, his shoes are in

exactly the same state of disrepair.

105   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    105

A little later, and alone, he's exploring the house. It's

richly and tastefully decorated, highly personal. He goes

along a corridor and down a wide stairway. Jack begins sniffing

outside of one door, as though he wants to go inside.

35.

106   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                        106

George opens the door and goes into the room, it's a kind of

storeroom in which everything is covered up with sheets. He

closes the door behind him. The room has a ghostly quality to

it. Jack sniffs about everywhere. George too seems troubled by

the strange pervading atmosphere. His curiosity is spurred by

a convoluted object that is covered in a thin cloth. A ray of

light surges into the room. The door has opened and, standing

against the daylight, is a maid.

Title card: You should go back to your room, Sir.

George nods with a smile. The maid leaves pretty swiftly, we

haven't seen her face, the whole moment seems rather strange.

George is intrigued but leaves the room. He has to call Jack

to him. Jack is reluctant to go but finally obeys his master.

107   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY SET - 1931 - DAY             107

A screenplay lies on a table. Peppy and Zimmer are seated

either side of the table and are talking animatedly. We're on

the set we saw the previous day, and Peppy seems to be trying

to convince Zimmer of something. She seems to be describing a

film poster or the facade of a movie theater she'd love to see.

He doesn't seem too enthusiastic from the looks of the negative

shakes of his head and his apologetic air as he listens to

Peppy. She finally stops talking and gives him a determined

look. Zimmer, uncomfortable and sorry, calmly replies.

Title card: George is a silent movie actor. He belongs to the

past. Today he's a nobody.

As Zimmer's speaking, she removes her accessories and hat.

Zimmer is so intrigued he stops talking.

Title card: What are you doing?

She looks him straight in the eyes, and answers:

Title card: I'm stopping work. It's him or me.

She looks determined. He's looking unsure of himself. He

visibly isn't sure he's understood properly. She drives her

point home.

Title card: What I mean is it's either him AND me! Or neither

of us!

Zimmer still isn't sure he's understood. He just looks at

her.

Title card: I'm blackmailing you, get it?!

36.

Even when she's blackmailing, she's still pretty, and Zimmer

looks at her totally at a loss but at the same time it's

obvious that he's going to back down. The people around them

are listening in on their conversation and seem to be waiting

for his decision. There's an element of deja-vu to the

situation, and Zimmer, who already backed down a few years

before, gives in.

Title card: And why not...

She smiles at him, picks up the screenplay with delight, and

leaves. As he moves away she whistles at him. He turns round

and she vigorously blows him a kiss.

108   INT. PEPPY'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY                             108

The screenplay lies on the front seat of a car. The camera

pulls back, it's Clifton who is in the driving seat.

109   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - DAY                  109

George is lying in bed when his former chauffeur comes in. At

first, he's delighted to see him, but this turns into

astonishment and he seems to ask the man a question. The

chauffeur answers:

Title card: I work for Miss Miller now.

George visibly doesn't know what to think and, although he

remains pleasant, becomes somewhat reserved. It's as though

something has come between them. The chauffeur places the

screenplay on the bedside table. George seems to greet it

with mistrust, certainly not with enthusiasm.

The chauffeur also has a box of cakes with him that he puts

on a plate for George. George doesn't want any, it's all too

much...

Before he leaves, the chauffeur overcomes his habitual

reserve for the first time and says to George:

Title card: She's been good to you. She's always looked out

for you.

The chauffeur leaves without trying to convince George

further, as the other looks on full of pride and doubt.

37.

110   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  110

From the window, we see the chauffeur get into the car and

drive off. We recognize the car as being the one that belonged

to George.

(109) At the window, George watches him leave. Then he seems

to have an idea or, more exactly, an intuition.

111   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                      111

George goes into the room that's full of sheets. He goes

straight over to the object with the bizarre shape and lifts up

the sheet. Underneath he finds his former objet d'art, the

three monkeys "hear no evil", "speak no evil" and "see no

evil". He thinks for a moment, then pulls of another sheet to

reveal a piece of furniture. Once again it's a piece that used

to belong to him and we recognize it from having seen it at the

auction room.

After taking off several other sheets, George realizes that

she bought everything he had put up for sale: furniture,

paintings, objets d'art, souvenirs, etc. He rips off sheets

one after the other and the objects appear, even down to his

suits and tuxedos. He continues and discovers the painting

depicting him in a tux, waving and smiling. George looks

stunned at the sight of himself looking so full of life. He's

interrupted by the same ray of light which surges into the room

once more. This time, at the door, are the butler and the maid.

George walks towards them when he sees them. The closer he gets

to them, however, the more his expression tightens. We realize

that the butler is none other than the distinguished-looking

man who purchased everything at the auction, and that the maid

is the woman who was bidding against him to raise the sale

prices. George is looking at them as he leaves the room. He has

recognized them, but doesn't say anything to them. He walks

off, still shocked by what he's just realized.

112   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - DAY               112

He finishes putting on his burnt suit in his room, and leaves.

113   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  113

He goes down the stairs and flees the house.

38.

114   EXT. BEGGAR STREET - DAY                                  114

George is in the street wearing his burnt suit and damaged

shoes. He is shirtless. With Jack by his side, he walks along

the sidewalk. There are a few other people walking along. About

twenty yards ahead of him a man is begging. He holds out his

hand to passers-by. George approaches and, when there are no

other passers-by between him and George, the beggar glances at

him and lowers his hand. He doesn't raise it as George

approaches. George stops in front of him and looks at him, but

the beggar motions to him to scram. George continues on his

way. For that moment at least, he has become one of them.

He buttons up the collar of his suit in an attempt to hide the

fact that he doesn't have a shirt then, heads off and loses

himself in the crowd. Some distance later, he stops to check

his reflection in a shop window. The image he sees is that of a

bum. It's even more striking because the in the window there is

a young male mannequin wearing a tux, top hat and white scarf.

The image of the mannequin and that of George are superimposed.

A cop comes up to George and begins talking to him in a

friendly manner. He speaks but we don't know what about. There

is not Title card. George visibly has no idea what the cop is

talking about. The cop seems to be talking about nothing

important, just chatting... He talks and talks... George

doesn't understand what he's saying, and doesn't understand

why he's talking to him. He's lost.

Title card: What did you say?

The cop smiles, carries on talking, then stops. He thinks

he's talking to a madman. He doesn't persist, merely sizes

George up and, once he's decided that he's harmless, the cop

walks off. George, totally bewildered by the incident, seems

to lose his grip on himself a little more.

115   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  115

Peppy gets home in the evening, arms laden with flowers. She's

happy.

She quickly goes up the stairs and into George's bedroom. He's

not there. She looks for him but can't find him. The maid says

that he has left. She drops the flowers.

116   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                           116

George goes into his house that has been disfigured by the

fire. The flames have changed everything and the atmosphere,

here again, seems ghostly and sad.

39.

George sits down in an armchair in the darkness. Jack sits down

facing him. He wags his tail and it thumps on the ground.

117   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                      117

In the room with all the sheets, Peppy is with the maid. The

maid seems to be telling her what happened with George, how he

removed all the sheets, etc. Peppy listens with an inscrutable

expression on her face. Then, suddenly overcome by a terrible

thought, she rushes outside.

118   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  118

She runs out of the house and over to the car, but the

chauffeur isn't there. She honks the horn to call him but

there's no response. She honks the horn again, then, not

wanting to wait any longer, and seeing the keys on the

dashboard, she gets behind the wheel, starts the engine and

pulls off in a series of kangaroo hops. It's obvious that she

doesn't know how to drive all that well, but still goes at full

speed - more or less successfully. Just as she passes through

the gate, the chauffeur turns up. Too late. He sees her drive

away.

119   EXT. PEPPY'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY                          119

Peppy is driving as fast as she can through town, but she's

pretty reckless and almost causes an accident.

120   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                           120

Outside George's house, the wind is slamming one of the

shutters with the regularity of a metronome. George takes a

gulp of liquor, then puts down the glass, opens a cardboard box

and takes out a pistol that he places on the table in front of

him. He picks up the glass for another gulp. Jack doesn't like

what he sees. He barks.

(119) As for Peppy, she's speeding along, totally ignoring

even the most basic of road safety requirements.

(120) George puts down his glass and picks up the pistol.

Jack isn't happy at all. He barks and bites George's trouser

leg, pulling on it.

(119) Peppy speeding along.

(120) George puts the pistol into his mouth. Jack is barking

like mad. George, still in the same position, closes his

eyes.

40.

Title card: "BANG!"

George is in the same position. He still has the pistol in

his mouth. Visibly, he's heard a BANG from outside, because

he takes the pistol out of his mouth and looks out the

window.

121   EXT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                            121

Outside, we see Peppy's car has rammed into the gate and is

still shuddering. Peppy didn't brake in time, but she doesn't

care. She jumps out the car and runs into the house.

122   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                            122

She rushes into the living room and stops for a moment to look

at George. George awkwardly tries to hide the pistol behind

him. She bursts into tears.

Title card: I feel so awful. I only wanted to help you. To

take care of you...

He seems to reply that no, it's not her fault, she's got

nothing to feel bad about. He opens his arms towards her,

still holding the pistol and the gun fires itself.

Fortunately no one is hurt, but the incident makes Peppy

laugh and, between sobs and gasps of laughter she throws

herself into George's arms. They hug for a long time. Peppy

says into his ear,

Title card: You've got so much that no one else has...

And into her ear, George replies:

Title card: No, I'm nothing but a shadow. No good for

anything but silence.

Peppy doesn't reply. She just holds him tighter still and

closes her eyes. Jack is sitting close by, watching them and

wagging his tail.

Outside, the shutter is still slamming and the car is still

shuddering. Peppy opens her eyes. Visibly, she's had an idea.

Jack wags his tail and thumps it on the ground. The shutter

slams. The car shudders. Peppy smiles at George.

Title card: I know what you have that no one else does.

Peppy moves away from George and motions to him to listen.

The shutter slams. Jacks tail thumps. The car shudders... Peppy

does a few tap steps. George doesn't understand.

41.

Peppy starts again, with a beaming smile, waiting for his

response. George does a few tap steps himself, basic ones,

without any great enthusiasm. She smiles at him and does a

few more complex steps that are a lot livelier. He smiles

back finally understanding the golden gift that he has in his

feet. He looks at Peppy lovingly with a beaming smile on his

face.

123   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS (1931) - ZIMMER'S OFFICE - DAY     123

Music suddenly begins to play and we see feet dancing in

another decor. Except that from now on we actually hear the

sound of the tap steps. We pull back to find Peppy and George

in Zimmer's office. They're dancing for him. Little by little,

Zimmer is convinced by them, and, when they finish their

demonstration, he has a broad smile on his face.

124   INT. STUDIO - PEPPY & GEORGE - DAY                        124

We find Peppy and George on a film set, still dancing. The

piece of jazz they are dancing to has gone so crazy that now

everyone wants to get up and dance! They are dancing a tap

number facing the camera, in a decor representing a stylized

New York. The choreography is incredible, in the grand style

of the old Hollywood musicals and they finish with a knee

slide that brings them right up to us with big smiles on

their faces. The music stops on a powerful blast from the

brass instruments that leaves everyone bursting with energy.

In the ensuing silence, Peppy and George stay exactly where

they were, facing the camera, with the smile stuck on their

faces. It goes on for a little too long, they are out of

breath.

Then they look at someone off-shot. They are facing a film

crew (from their era of course). The director smiles. Zimmer,

sitting next to him, seems ecstatic. The director speaks and

we hear what he says.

DIRECTOR

Cut! Excellent!

Zimmer has both his thumbs up. The director says to Peppy and

George.

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

Once more? Please?

George laughs and replies, and we hear him too.

GEORGE

With pleasure!

42.

THE End

The credits run while Peppy and George go back to their

positions. The camera (ours) pulls back and into frame come

all the technicians who are setting up the shot, the hair,

make-up and costume people for continuity, the camera coming

into position, the director coming over to say a few words to

the star couple, in short: the shot being prepared for

another take. And, when everyone is in position, the director

speaks into his megaphone and we hear "OK, Camera! Sound!

Rolling... and... Action!"

Fade to black and the music picks up again for the end of the

credit sequence.
