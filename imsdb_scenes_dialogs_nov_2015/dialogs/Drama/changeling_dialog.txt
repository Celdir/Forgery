CHANGELING

A True Story

Written by

J. Michael Straczynski

EVERYTHING YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE, HAPPENED

CHRISTINE

Walter...time for school, honey.

WALTER

Just ten more minutes --

CHRISTINE

Sorry, champ.

(more)

CHRISTINE (Cont'd)

You can sleep in all you want

tomorrow, that's what Saturdays are

for. Now hurry up or your breakfast

will get cold.

WALTER

It's cereal, it's supposed to be

cold.

CHRISTINE

We're here, sweetie.   Come on.

CHRISTINE

Okay Sandy, what's the prob--

OPERATOR

You deal with this one, I'm not

going near it.

CHRISTINE

Hello? Yes, this is the supervisor,

ma'am, what can I --

(checks board)

Yes, I can see that you're on a

party line, ma'am, what can I --

(beat)

I know, it's unfortunate, but people

sometimes do listen in on party

lines. We hope to have private

lines installed by --

(beat)

Well, what's he doing when you're

on the phone?

(beat)

Are you sure? Maybe there's a

problem with the phone line. He

could be asthmatic, or --

(beat)

Oh. No, I...I've never heard of

anything like that before either.

Guess there's a first time for

everything, right? No, I'm afraid

there's nothing we can do about

people abusing the equipment or...

themselves. I'm sorry. I --

MR. HARRIS

Everything all right?

CHRISTINE

Fine, Mr. Harris...fine...just

someone having a problem with a...

with the connection.

MR. HARRIS

Tell them to take the plug and shove

it in and out a few times, that'll

usually do it.

CHRISTINE

Unfortunately that was part of the

problem. If you'll excuse me....

CHRISTINE

Hey, sport.

WALTER

Hey, mom.

CHRISTINE

So how was school?

WALTER

Okay. We learned about dinosaurs,

and I got in a fight with Billy

Mankowski.

CHRISTINE

What happened?

WALTER

He hit me.

CHRISTINE

Did you hit him back?

(he nods)

Good. Rule number one: Never start

a fight, but always finish it. So

why did he hit you?

WALTER

Because I hit him.

CHRISTINE

Wait...you hit him first?

(he nods)

Why?

WALTER

He said my dad ran off because he

didn't like me.

CHRISTINE

Your dad never even had a chance to

meet you...so how could he not like

you?

WALTER

Then why did he leave?

CHRISTINE

Well, the same day you were born,

something else arrived. It came in

the mail, in a box just slightly

bigger than you. You know what was

in that box?

(he shakes head)

Something called responsibility.

Now, to some people, responsibility

is fun, it's what you live your

whole life for. Other people think

it's the scariest thing in the world.

WALTER

So he ran away because he was scared

of what was in the box?

CHRISTINE

Yup.

WALTER

That's dumb.

CHRISTINE

That's what I thought.

CHRISTINE

Walter, I decided a long time ago

that I would always tell you the

truth, that I would treat you like

a grown-up. I can't expect you to

respect me unless I respect you.

(beat)

I've never lied to you. Your father

leaving had nothing to do with you,

and everything to do with what was

in the responsibility box.

WALTER

Pinky-swear?

CHRISTINE

Pinky-swear.

CHRISTINE

First one to the corner store gets

ice cream!

WALTER

Did I miss Amos and Andy?

CHRISTINE

I'm afraid so, sport.   Come on now,

time for bed.

WALTER

Are we still going to the movies

tomorrow?

CHRISTINE

Uh-huh. I hear there's a new Charlie

Chaplin playing down at Grauman's,

and a new serial called The

Mysterious Airman.

WALTER

Who's that?

CHRISTINE

I don't know. Nobody does. That's

what makes him so mysterious.

WALTER

Oh.   Am I too heavy for you to carry?

CHRISTINE

Not for years yet, Walter.     Not for

years.

CHRISTINE

Hello?

(beat)

Oh, hello, Margaret. I'm fine,

thanks. No, I was just --

(beat)

You're kidding. When did she call

in sick?

(checks watch)

What about Myrna? I know she could

use the extra hours. Oh. No, it's

just...I promised Walter I'd take

him to the movies today. There has

to be somebody else....

(beat)

All right, I...guess we can do it

tomorrow. I'll get there as soon

as I can. But just until four,

okay? See you in a bit.

CHRISTINE

There's a sandwich and milk in the

icebox, and I've asked Mrs. Riley

if her daughter can stop by in a

couple of hours, just to --

WALTER

I can take care of myself.

CHRISTINE

Of course you can. She's coming by

to check on the house, not you.

CHRISTINE

Tomorrow, we'll go to the movies.

Then we'll ride the Big Red down to

Santa Monica and walk on the pier.

How's that? That okay?

(more)

CHRISTINE (Cont'd)

(he nods)

Good. I'll be back before it gets

dark.

WALTER

I'm not afraid of the dark.     I'm

not afraid of anything.

CHRISTINE

I know you're not, honey. That's

how I raised you.

(kisses his head)

Be good. See you in a bit.

OPERATORS

We've got lines jammed from here to

Ohio...he insists on talking to

someone in charge...I've tried

everything and the console's just

dead...I need your signature here

for a supply requisition....

CHRISTINE

All right, get me the Omaha routing

station, see if we can put the calls

through their switchers...and let's

get that console running....

MR. HARRIS

Christine...good, I was hoping to

catch you. I've been following

your work reports, and I just want

you to know that I'm very impressed.

MR. HARRIS

When I first suggested hiring female

supervisors, my superiors weren't

big on the idea. But you've held

your own as well as any of our male

supervisors, and --

CHRISTINE

Thank you, Mr. Harris, but I --

MR. HARRIS

Ben, please. Point is, we're looking

for someone to take on a managerial

position in our new Beverly Hills

office. If you're interested I can --

CHRISTINE

That's great, Mr. Harris, I really

appreciate the vote of confidence.

MR. HARRIS

Good, good...so maybe we could --

CHRISTINE

I'm sorry, but I really have to go.

We'll talk on Monday. Good night!

CHRISTINE

Wait...wait...hold on, just a --

CHRISTINE

Walter?

CHRISTINE

Walter...?

CHRISTINE

Walter?   Honey? Time to come in.

CHRISTINE

Susie honey, have you seen Walter?

GIRL

Nuh-uh.

CHRISTINE

Mrs. Riley, I'm sorry to bother you

at dinnertime, but I was wondering

if Walter was here.

MRS. RILEY

No, I'm afraid not.

CHRISTINE

Do you know if Jamie was able to

look in on him?

MRS. RILEY

Well, I mentioned it to her, but

she was going to a dance with some

of her friends...you know how

teenagers are. Is everything all

right?

CHRISTINE

I'm sure it's fine, I just...

(beat)

Thank you, Mrs. Riley.

CHRISTINE

Walter...?     Walter....

CHRISTINE

Yes, Operator, give me the police.

POLICE DISPATCHER (on phone)

Lincoln Heights Division.

CHRISTINE

Yes, hello, my name is Christine

Collins, I live at 210 North Avenue

23...I'm calling to report a missing

child...it's my son, he....

POLICE DISPATCHER (on phone)

How long has he been gone?

CHRISTINE

I'm not sure...I just got home from

work and...it could be since late

this morning, it could be just an

hour --

POLICE DISPATCHER (on phone)

Have you checked around the

neighborhood?

CHRISTINE

Yes, of course, I --

POLICE DISPATCHER (on phone)

Maybe he lost track of the time.

CHRISTINE

No, he always stays around the house

when it starts to get dark. Can

you please send someone down here?

POLICE DISPATCHER (on phone)

I'm sorry, but our policy is that

we don't dispatch units on missing

child cases for twenty-four hours.

CHRISTINE

What?   But that's --

POLICE DISPATCHER (on phone)

Ninety-nine times out of a hundred

the kid shows up by morning. We

don't have the resources to go

chasing every kid who runs off with

his pals and --

CHRISTINE

That's not Walter, he doesn't do

that.

POLICE DISPATCHER (on phone)

With all due respect, ma'am, every

parent who calls us says the same

thing.

CHRISTINE

Please, I --

POLICE DISPATCHER (on phone)

I'm sorry, but there's nothing I

can do. I'll take your name and

information, but that's all until

tomorrow morning at the earliest.

POLICE DISPATCHER (V.O.)

I'm sure he'll show up by then.

They always do.

REV. BRIEGLEB (V.O.)

Our thoughts go out again to Mrs.

Christine Collins, of Lincoln Heights --

REV. BRIEGLEB (V.O.)

-- whose young son, Walter Collins,

disappeared almost two weeks ago.

REV. BRIEGLEB

Though she is not a member of our

congregation, we pray for her today

(more)

REV. BRIEGLEB (Cont'd)

as we have every day since we first

learned of her situation on the

radio, and in the newspapers.

(beat)

We are told that the Los Angeles

Police Department is doing the best

it can to reunite mother and child,

and I am sure that is true.

(beat)

But given its position as the most

violent, corrupt and incompetent

police department this side of the

Rocky Mountains, that's not saying

a great deal.

REV. BRIEGLEB

Every day, new bodies show up along

Mulholland, or in ditches, the work

of Police Chief James Davis and his

so-called "gun squad." Every day

the needs of honest citizens are

put second to greed and personal

gain. Every day, the city sinks

deeper into a cesspool of fear,

intimidation and corruption. Once

the City of Angels, Los Angeles is

now a place where our protectors

have become our brutalizers...where

to be the law...is to be above the

law...where none dare speak truth

to power.

(beat)

But we will not be silent. We will

continue to put their offenses and

their failures in full view of the

public. We will not be intimidated.

REV. BRIEGLEB (on radio)

Because while the "gun squad" speaks

in the only language Chief Davis

understands, we speak in the language

of compassion, truth and strength.

We speak for our fellow citizens,

beaten and killed by a renegade

police department.

(more)

REV. BRIEGLEB (on radio) (Cont'd)

We speak for an innocent child,

ripped from his mother's arms, now

all but forgotten by the police.

And that voice, my friends, will

never be silenced.

DISSOLVE TO:

MR. HARRIS (V.O.)

Are you sure you're ready for this,

Christine?

MR. HARRIS

I mean, if you need more time --

CHRISTINE

The police are doing all they can,

and frankly I could use the money.

It's been almost a month, and...it

wouldn't do any good to find Walter

and bring him home if he doesn't

have a home to come back to, right?

MR. HARRIS

Of course.

MR. HARRIS

Well...I'll leave you to it, then.

CHRISTINE

Excuse me, can I have your attention?

CHRISTINE

Listen, everyone, I appreciate your

consideration, but I'm not made of

porcelain. I won't break down and

cry if the station to station call

to Kankakee doesn't go through.

(a thin smile)

Actually, I...promised myself that

I wouldn't cry...wouldn't let myself

cry...until I knew, one way or

another, what....

(beat)

Point is...I like the noise here.

So don't be afraid to talk and...push

buttons, and drop things. If it

wasn't noisy, how would I know I

was in the right place?

MR. HARRIS

Excuse me, has anyone seen Christine?

OPERATOR

I think I saw her in the back office.

CHRISTINE (O.S.)

-- well, if you do hear anything,

would you let me know? Thanks, I

appreciate it. Goodbye.

CHRISTINE

Missing Persons department, please.

(beat)

Yes, hello, this is Christine

Collins, I...yes, fine, thank you.

I was just checking back to see if

you had found any missing or lost

children that might match the --

(beat)

I see. No, I appreciate that, it's

just...it never hurts to make sure

all the lines of communication are

working. I mean, that's what I do

for a living, right?

(beat)

Well, I'll try back next week. If

you do hear anything in the meantime,

would you be sure to let me know?

Thanks. Goodbye.

CHRISTINE

Missing persons department, please.

DISSOLVE TO:

COOK

Two dollars.

MAN

Hell...looks like I left my wallet

at home. Can I owe it to you?

COOK

No credit. Pay up or I call the

cops. I'm tired of bums like you

coming around here.

MAN

I'm not trying to stiff you, chief.

I just left my wallet at home, that's

all. I'll go back and get it.

Five, ten minutes tops.

COOK

You got any collateral?

MAN

Can't ask for better collateral

than a man's own flesh and blood,

right?

(to the boy)

You stay here, son, I'll be right

back.

BOY

But --

MAN

Now don't give me any trouble.

He's a good man to trust us like

this. You just sit here while I go

get my wallet. Okay?

COOK

Ten minutes, then I'm calling the

cops.

COOK

Ah, hell....

COOK

Hello, Myrtle? It's Harve, down by

the diner. Would you get me Sheriff

Larsen? Yeah, I'll wait.

COOK

What's your name, son?    Son...?

BOY

I don't remember.

COOK

Swell.

JONES

Mrs. Collins?

JONES

My name is Captain J. J. Jones,

Lincoln Park Juvenile Division. My

office supervises all runaway and

missing child cases, including your

son's, and....

(beat, a smile)

He's alive, Mrs. Collins. He was

picked up two days ago by local

police in De Kalb, Illinois. He's

safe and unhurt. He was in the

company of some drifter, we've got

an APB out for him now, and --

DISSOLVE TO:

CHRISTINE

All these reporters...you didn't

tell me --

JONES

Yours is a story with a happy ending,

Mrs. Collins. People love happy

endings.

(checks watch)

Train should be pulling in shortly.

We'd better get a move on.

JONES

Thank you...we'll have a statement

for you in a little while.

(more)

JONES (Cont'd)

Right now the important thing is to

re-unite this little lady with her

son. So if you'll excuse us....

"WALTER"

Did you know that Los Angeles is

where they make the Tom Mix movies?

MATRON

No, I didn't.

"WALTER"

His horse is named Blue.

(beat)

You think they'll let me watch them

make a movie?

MATRON

I don't know, you'll have to ask.

But with all this attention, who

knows, maybe they will.

JONES

Mrs. Collins, I'd like to introduce

you to Chief of Police James E.

Davis.

CHRISTINE

Oh, my, I didn't expect --

DAVIS

We don't get a lot of positive

attention from the boys in the press

these days, so it's good to be here

when there's a positive story, don't

you think?

DAVIS

I take it you've been treated well

by my boys in the department?

CHRISTINE

Oh...yes, of course, they've been

great. Well, there was that part

about having to wait twenty-four

hours before filing a report, but --

DAVIS

Technicalities aside --

CHRISTINE

Yes...other than that, no complaints.

They've all been wonderful.

DAVIS

Good, then you won't have any problem

telling that to the press, and how

the LAPD is concerned first and

foremost with the safety of --

JONES

Women.    Just a sec....

CHRISTINE

Walter...Walter!

JONES

Well?   Aren't you going to --

CHRISTINE

He's not my son.

JONES

I...what are you --

CHRISTINE

He's not my son.

(beat)

He's not my son.

JONES

I'm...I'm sure you're mistaken.

CHRISTINE

Mistaken?

JONES

He's been through four long, terrible

months...he's gone through changes,

lost weight --

CHRISTINE

I know my own son.

JONES

I'm just saying...I mean, you're in

shock, and he's changed, and --

JONES

What's your name, son?   Can you

tell me your name?

"WALTER"

Walter Collins.

CHRISTINE

It's a common name, it --

JONES

Do you know where you live, Walter?

Do you know your home address?

"WALTER"

My house is at 210 North Avenue 23,

Los Angeles, California.

(beat)

And that's my Mommy!

JONES

Mrs. Collins...listen to me. I

know you're feeling uncertain right

now, but that's to be expected...a

boy this age changes so fast...but

we've compensated for that in our

investigation. We're experts in

child identification. There's no

question that this is your son.

CHRISTINE

It's not Walter.

JONES

It's not Walter as you remember him.

That's why it's important for you

to take him home, on a...trial basis.

CHRISTINE

A trial basis?

JONES

Once you've put him back in familiar

surroundings, and given yourself

time to recover from the shock of

his changed condition...you'll see

that it is him. I swear to you,

Mrs. Collins. I give you my word.

Trust me...this is your son.

JONES

If there's any problem, any problem

at all, come and talk to me and

I'll take care of it.

(beat)

Mrs. Collins...he has nowhere else

to go.

CHRISTINE

I...look, I'll take him home, but

only because I...might not be

thinking clearly right now, and --

JONES

Thank you.

REPORTERS

How does it feel to have your son

home, Mrs. Collins? What did you

think when you saw him for the first

time?

CHRISTINE

It was...it's...hard to explain.

JONES

(jumping in)

It was certainly quite a shock. At

first she hardly recognized him.

Perfectly natural, the boy's been

through quite an ordeal.

REPORTER

How're you feeling, son?   Bet it

feels great to be home.

"WALTER"

Yeah, it's great!

DAVIS

The Los Angeles Police Department

is thankful for all the hard work

done by the De Kalb County Sheriff's

Department in helping to make this

joyful reunion possible. The LAPD

is dedicated to serving the public

at all times, and --

ANOTHER REPORTER

Can we get a photo of mother and

son, Captain?

CHRISTINE

I --

JONES

Absolutely.

CHRISTINE

Was the sandwich all right?

(he nods)

Would you like some more milk?

"WALTER"

No.

CHRISTINE

No, thank you.

"WALTER"

No, thank you.

CHRISTINE

Now you need a bath. You're covered

with soot from the train ride.

CHRISTINE

I found you a pair of pajamas. I

bought them for Walter but he didn't

like the fabric, so --

"WALTER" (O.S.)

Ow!

CHRISTINE

Are you all right?

"WALTER"

I fell.   Stupid tub.

CHRISTINE

Did you hurt yourself?     Let me see --

CHRISTINE

...circumcised....

CHRISTINE

The last time I measured Walter --

the last time I measured my son --

he was four inches taller than you

are right now.

(beat)

Who are you?

(beat)

What are you doing here?

(beat)

Who are you?

CHRISTINE

He's not my son.

JONES

Mrs. Collins --

CHRISTINE

I don't know who he is, or why he's

saying he's Walter, but there's

clearly been some kind of mistake.

JONES

We agreed you would give him time

to adjust --

CHRISTINE

He's four inches shorter than Walter.

Boys his age don't shrink. If

anything, he should be taller.

JONES

Maybe your measurements are off.

Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable

explanation for --

CHRISTINE

He's circumcised. Walter wasn't.

JONES

Mrs. Collins...your son was missing

for four months. For at least part

of that in the company of an as-yet

unidentified drifter. Who knows

what such a disturbed individual

might have done? He could have had

him...circumcised... might have --

CHRISTINE

Made him smaller? Captain, please --

CHRISTINE

-- why won't you listen to me?

JONES

I am listening, damn it, I --

(beat, calmer)

I am listening. And I understand

your feelings. He's changed, no

mistake. You've both been through

a terrible experience. That's why

he needs your support and love to

bounce back.

CHRISTINE

Captain, that boy wouldn't bounce

back as my son if you coated him in

rubber and dropped him off the roof.

JONES

Why are you doing this, Mrs. Collins?

You seem perfectly capable of taking

care of the boy, your work pays you

enough to attend to his personal

needs...so I don't understand why

you're trying to run away from your

responsibilities --

CHRISTINE

I'm not running away from anything,

least of all my responsibilities.

I'm even taking care of that boy

because right now I'm all he has.

What worries me is that you've

stopped looking for Walter.

JONES

Why should we look someone we've

already found?

CHRISTINE

But you haven't found him. He's

still out there somewhere, lost,

maybe hurt....

JONES

His identity has been confirmed by

the best minds in the field of child

identification, people who know

what they're doing.

CHRISTINE

And I don't? Captain, look, I don't

want to cause trouble for you or

the department. Honestly I don't.

I know you've done everything you

can...but there's been a terrible

mistake, and I need your help if

we're going to correct it...before

it's too late. Please.

JONES

Sara, get Dr. Tarr on the phone.

DR. TARR

Mrs. Collins? Dr. Earl W. Tarr.

Captain Jones sent me. I consult

with him from time to time on

juvenile cases. May I come in?

CHRISTINE

Oh...yes, of course.

CHRISTINE

Thank you for coming. I'm surprised

Captain Jones moved so quickly. I

was starting to think he didn't

believe me.

DR. TARR

Well, I'm here now, and we'll put

all that to rights. Where is the

boy?

DR. TARR

Ah! There he is. A handsome young

man. He has your eyes, doesn't he?

And a little bit of the nose. Very

fit, in spite of all his travails.

A very resilient boy you've got

here, Mrs. Collins.

CHRISTINE

Doctor Tarr, I thought you were

here to help me.

DR. TARR

I am. Captain Jones said the boy

had gone through some extreme

physical changes, and asked me to

look in on him...to reassure you in

this your time of motherly concern.

CHRISTINE

My "motherly concern" isn't for him

because he's not my son.

DR. TARR

Statements like that will hardly

help the boy's self-esteem, now

will they?

(beat)

Captain Jones said something about

a change in height...?

CHRISTINE

He's four inches shorter than --

DR. TARR

Ah, well...hardly a mystery, Mrs.

Collins. We've known for some time

that trauma can affect the growth

of children. Given the stress of

the last four months his spine may

have actually shrunk. It's uncommon,

but within the realm of possibility.

CHRISTINE

What about the circumcision?

DR. TARR

Very likely his abductor thought it

appropriate. After all, circumcision

is hygienically sound. Must have

been quite traumatic at the time.

No wonder he's submerged the memory.

CHRISTINE

Look, doctor --

DR. TARR

As you can see, there's a perfectly

sound medical explanation for all

of this. But it's good for you to

raise these questions. You should

be apprised of all changes the lad

went through during his absence.

CHRISTINE

Wouldn't I know whether or not he

was my son? I'm his mother.

DR. TARR

Which means you're in no position

to be objective. You are looking

through the prism of extreme emotion

at a boy who has changed from what

you remember. He isn't the same

boy that left here, just as a boy

who goes off to war and returns

isn't the same anymore.

(more)

DR. TARR (Cont'd)

A mother's heart, driven by intuition

and emotion rather than logic, sees

these changes and rebels, insists

that this cannot be your son. But

that doesn't change the facts.

(beat)

I'm willing to put my theory to the

test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins...

are you?

CHRISTINE

What're you --

DR. TARR

Hello, children, my name is Dr.

Earl W. Tarr. I'd like to ask you

some questions.

1ST KID

My mom says we're not supposed to

talk to strangers.

DR. TARR

Good boy. Quite right. But as you

see I'm with the police, so it's

all right. Now, I'm sure you know

Mrs. Collins here, and her son,

Walter. How many of you recognize

this young boy as Walter Collins?

DR. TARR

Now, now, no need to be afraid.

Surely you knew Walter, and played

with him? So which of you can

identify Walter for me, for his

mother, and for the police? This

officer would want you to do the

right thing as good young citizens.

2ND KID

Walter was as tall as me....

DR. TARR

Yes, precisely. He was as tall as

you. Now he's not. He's lost a

little height, you see. It's a

thing called trauma. With luck,

none of you will ever have to find

out about it yourselves. So other

than that, do you recognize this as

your friend, Walter Collins?

2ND KID

I guess...

CHRISTINE

Dr. Tarr --

DR. TARR

Already ahead of you, Mrs. Collins;

children can be intimidated. But

not adults. Shall we try a neighbor?

DR. TARR

-- and we'd appreciate it if you

could make a positive identification

for us.

MRS. RILEY

I'd be happy to. I saw the boy

often. Come closer, son.

DR. TARR

Take your time...be sure.

MRS. RILEY

Oh, yes...yes...that's Walter all

right. Used to come here all the

time to play with my nephew, Roger.

DR. TARR

Thank you, Mrs. Riley.   You've been

a big help, I --

CHRISTINE

Before we go...Mrs. Riley, do you

have the time?

MRS. RILEY

Certainly....

MRS. RILEY

My last concession to vanity; men

don't make passes at women who wear

glasses, you know.

(checks the watch)

Five o'clock.

CHRISTINE

Thank you.

DR. TARR

A boy is much larger than a watch,

Mrs. Collins.

(to "Walter")

Come along, son.

CHRISTINE (V.O.)

This is absolutely outrageous!

CHRISTINE

Captain, I...no, listen to me, this

so-called doctor paraded me around

my own neighborhood like some kind

of derelict mother who couldn't

even recognize her own --

(beat)

He found what he expected to find,

what you obviously told him he would

find, but it's not --

(beat)

No, I am not reassured.

(more)

CHRISTINE (Cont'd)

I thought we had an understanding,

I --

(beat)

That I was embarrassed isn't the

issue, the point is you're wasting

time when you should be looking for

my son, I --

(beat)

Then I want to see this report, so

I can refute it, before it goes to

anyone else, all right? Fine.

"WALTER"

I'm finished. Can I go to my room

now?

CHRISTINE

Yes.   Go on up.

"WALTER"

G'night, Mommy.

CHRISTINE

Stop saying that! I'm not your

mother! And you're not my son!

CHRISTINE

WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU DOING

THIS TO ME? DAMN YOU! I WANT MY

SON BACK!

CHRISTINE

I want my son back...god, please...

make it stop...just make it stop.

CHRISTINE

I was wrong to yell at you. You're

still a child, and I think you don't

really understand what you're doing,

the hurt you're causing. Maybe

this is all just some big game of

pretend to you, but I need you to

understand. Walter is...he's all I

have, he's everything to me, and

every day we lose because of this

puts him further away from where I

can help him.

(beat)

Whatever the police think, whatever

the world thinks, we know the truth,

don't we? We both know you're not

Walter. Getting you to admit that

may be the only chance I have to

straighten this out before it's too

late. Maybe you're afraid of getting

in trouble, that you're in too deep.

But you're not. You don't have to

tell me who you are, you just have

to tell them who you're not. Just...

tell them the truth.

DISSOLVE TO:

CHRISTINE

Hello?

REV. BRIEGLEB (on phone)

Is this Mrs. Christine Collins?

CHRISTINE

Yes?   Who is this?

REV. BRIEGLEB (on phone)

My name is Gustav Briegleb, I'm the

pastor over at St. Paul's --

CHRISTINE

Oh, yes, I heard some of your radio

broadcasts after my son...you were

very supportive, and I appreciate --

REV. BRIEGLEB (on phone)

Mrs. Collins...have you seen the

Times today?

CHRISTINE

No, I --

REV. BRIEGLEB (on phone)

You'd better take a look. Then

come by the parish in an hour for

breakfast. I think we should meet.

CHRISTINE

"Acting on the request of the Los

Angeles Police Department, Dr. Earl

(more)

CHRISTINE (Cont'd)

W. Tarr, child specialist, examined

Walter Collins to determine the

cause of his loss of weight,

paleness, confusion and run-down

condition noticed since the return

of the boy to his mother last

Saturday."

REV. BRIEGLEB

Lovely bit of phrasing, isn't it?

Noticed since the return of the boy

to his mother. Not only does it

state clearly that you are the boy's

mother, one could infer from this

that you are somehow responsible

for these changes...and that the

police are concerned for the boy's

welfare in your hands.

(beat)

You should try the eggs, they're

very good.

CHRISTINE

(still reading)

"I examined the boy quite thoroughly,

Dr. Tarr said --

DR. TARR

-- and it's clear that he has

something to tell. I'm sure that

in time he will give his boyish

story of the entire affair, but not

until he has faith in his listener.

And that is what is lacking: faith

in the poor lad's story. In the

course of my examination, I found

nothing to dispute the findings by

the LAPD.

REPORTER

How come he hasn't been able to

tell anyone what happened while he

was gone?

DR. TARR

I would say that the boy has either

been coached or questioned to a

point where he is largely confused

about what happened to him during

(more)

DR. TARR (Cont'd)

those many months. It's possible

that his mental lapse may be the

result of a blow to the head or a

sudden shock which brought about a

possible cranial injury. I believe

that this condition will pass soon.

Until then, I recommend that the

police department continue working

with him, exposing him to whatever

elements of his previous life as

may help restore his memory.

CHRISTINE

Captain Jones promised he'd let me

see the report before it went

anywhere else.

REV. BRIEGLEB

Someone in authority at the LAPD

lied? Good heavens, I may have to

go lie down.

REV. BRIEGLEB

I was not laughing at your situation,

Mrs. Collins. It's just...after

one has this sort of conversation

enough times, a certain degree of

hysteria begins to set in. Please,

sit.

CHRISTINE

Why are they doing this?

REV. BRIEGLEB

To avoid admitting a mistake...that

they brought back the wrong boy.

(off her look)

Anyone reading that with half a

brain would see through it instantly.

Sadly, that leaves out about half

the Times' readership, but still....

CHRISTINE

Thank you.

(more)

CHRISTINE (Cont'd)

I've been trying to get someone to

say those words since...god, I was

starting to think I was losing my

mind.

(beat)

Thank you. At least someone believes

me.

REV. BRIEGLEB

You have no idea how many people

have sat in that very chair and

said those exact same words to me

in relation to our friends at the

Los Angeles Police Department.

(beat)

Mrs. Collins, I have made it my

mission to bring to light all the

things the LAPD would prefer no one

knew anything about...a department

ruled by violence, abuse, murder,

corruption and intimidation.

REV. BRIEGLEB (O.S.)

When Chief Davis took over the LAPD

two years ago, he said --

DAVIS

(overlapping)

We will hold court on gunmen in the

Los Angeles streets. I want them

brought in dead, not alive, and I

will reprimand any officer who shows

the least mercy to a criminal.

REV. BRIEGLEB (V.O.)

He picked fifty of the most dangerous

cops on the force, gave them machine

guns and permission to shoot anyone

who got in their way. He called

them the Gun Squad. No lawyers.

No trials. No questions, suspensions

or investigations. Just piles of

bodies.

REV. BRIEGLEB (V.O.)

Bodies in morgues, bodies in

hospitals, bodies by the side of

the road, barely alive. Not because

the police wanted to wipe out crime,

they just wanted to get rid of the

competition.

REV. BRIEGLEB (V.O.)

Mayor Cryer and half the police

force are on the take. Prostitution,

gambling, bootlegging, you name it.

(beat)

When the gloves came off, pretty

soon the rest of the department got

into the brutality act. Didn't

want the Gun Squad to have all the

fun, after all.

REV. BRIEGLEB (V.O.)

The more they got away with it, the

worse things got, because when you

give folks the freedom to do whatever

they want, as God saw in the Garden

of Eden, they'll do just that.

REV. BRIEGLEB

This police department does not

tolerate dissent, contradiction...

or embarrassment, Mrs. Collins.

You have the power to embarrass

them...and they don't like it. Not

when they became the Heroes of the

Hour the day they stood there posing

with you, having rescued a lost boy

from the wilderness.

(more)

REV. BRIEGLEB (Cont'd)

(beat)

They will do everything they can to

discredit you. I've seen it happen

too many times to start going blind

now. That's why I wanted to see

you, so you'd know what you were

getting into...and how to fight

them.

CHRISTINE

Reverend Briegleb...I appreciate

what you're saying, and what you're

doing...but I'm not on a mission.

The only thing I want is to find my

son, that's all, and I just --

REV. BRIEGLEB

A lot of mothers' sons ended up

being sacrificed to expediency around

here, Mrs. Collins. Yours wouldn't

be the first. Do this right, and

maybe yours will be the last.

CHRISTINE

If they honestly thought I was wrong,

that'd be one thing...but if they

don't care, if they're just trying

to cover it up....

REV. BRIEGLEB

This is their attempt to win by

framing the discussion their way.

"Why, of course it's her son...yes,

there have been changes...we're

looking into it, and isn't it strange

that they happened after the boy

got home?"

(beat)

They're putting you in the position

of having to disprove what they're

saying...and that's hard. Most

people believe what they hear from

the police or the government. If

you play it their way, you...and

your son...are going to lose.

CHRISTINE

What do I have to do?

REV. BRIEGLEB

Change the rules of engagement. Re-

define the argument. They brought

in their expert, so you bring in

yours. You have an advantage they

don't. You know your son better

than they ever will, and in that

knowledge is the proof you need.

(beat)

Get that information, put it out

there. Make them respond to you,

not the other way around.

REV. BRIEGLEB

Once people side with the police,

it's a hard climb...but even in a

town as loud as this one, the voice

of truth can be heard...if you're

willing to take it all the way in

spite of the dangers...and they are

very real, Mrs. Collins, make no

mistake. Once you open the book on

these people, you're going to be

looking over your shoulder every

day, maybe for the rest of your

life.

(beat)

You up to it, Mrs. Collins?

CHRISTINE

Well?

DR. MONTGOMERY

He had two cavities that needed

filling. He put up a fight, but I

took care of it.

CHRISTINE

And...?

DR. MONTGOMERY

Your son's upper front teeth were

separated by a small muscle. Made

them sit about an eighth of an inch

apart. The boy in that room has no

such gap.

CHRISTINE

Does a gap like that get smaller

with age? Because that's what

they'll say.

DR. MONTGOMERY

In some cases, yes, it's possible.

But the muscle between Walter's

teeth prevents that from happening.

They can never come together without

an operation to sever the muscle,

and I can tell you right now that

he has never had such an operation.

CHRISTINE

Will you be willing to sign a letter

saying that officially?

DR. MONTGOMERY

Pardon my language, but...hell,

yes.

DR. MONTGOMERY

Sounds like the anesthetic is wearing

off.

(starts in, pauses)

On the other hand, maybe I'll write

that letter first. Give the little

fella something to think about.

CHRISTINE

Well? What do you think? Is that

the Walter Collins that you remember?

MRS. FOX

If it is, he's changed enormously.

(to "Walter")

Do you know who I am?

"WALTER"

You're a teacher.

MRS. FOX

Yes, but even teachers have names.

What's mine?

"WALTER"

I don't remember. I know you, but

I don't remember your name.

MRS. FOX

My name is Mrs. Fox.   Now, take

your seat.

MRS. FOX

I didn't say take a seat. I said

take your seat. Your assigned seat.

You must know which one it is, you

sat there for over a year.

MRS. FOX

Try again. Here's a hint: There's

only one more empty seat left.

MRS. FOX

Mrs. Collins, if that's your son,

I'll eat my yardstick. Not only

will I put that in writing, I'll

swear to it in a court of law and

in front of President Calvin Coolidge

himself if I have to.

DISSOLVE TO:

REV. BRIEGLEB

I'll see you tonight at eight for

my broadcast. I'll leave the back

door open and a light on. Good

luck.

CHRISTINE

Good morning. My name is Christine

Collins. On March 10th, my nine

year old son, Walter Collins,

disappeared. A four month

investigation resulted in a boy

being brought to Los Angeles from

De Kalb, Illinois. They told me,

and all of you, that this boy was

my son. They were wrong.

(beat)

The Los Angeles Police Department

made a mistake...a terrible mistake.

The boy they found is not my son.

That is the reason for the supposed

"transformation." I have letters

from his dentist, his teachers and

others confirming that this boy is

not my son. The letters are being

reprinted now, and I should have

them for you tomorrow.

CHRISTINE

I have given the police department

every opportunity to admit their

mistake and renew the search for my

son. Since they have refused to do

so, I have no choice but to present

my case before the public. I hope

this will persuade the police to

finish the job they started, and

bring my son home to me.

(beat)

Thank you.

JONES

Morelli, I want you to find the

Collins woman and get her here.

Bring her in the back way, and have

a couple of matrons standing by.

1ST COP

Yes, sir.

CHRISTINE

Why are we using the back door?

1ST COP

Captain's orders.     Front's jammed

with reporters.

CHRISTINE

Is it?

DESK SERGEANT

Hey...anybody want to take a call

from the Royal Canadian Mounties?

Ybarra?

YBARRA

What'd they do, lose a moose?

DESK SERGEANT

They need a juvenile living here

illegally deported back to Canada.

He's living with his cousin on some

ranch near Riverside, in Wineville.

YBARRA

All right, I'll take it, got nothing

better to do....

JONES

Mrs. Collins.

JONES

Leave the boy for now.   We'll look

after him.

JONES

You've put us through quite a bit

of trouble, Mrs. Collins. This

situation has become an embarrassment

for the entire department.

CHRISTINE

It wasn't my intention to embarrass

anyone.

JONES

No, of course not. You just told

the papers we can't tell one boy

from another as a compliment for

the months we spent working on your

case. Are you trying to make fools

out of us? Is that it? Do you

enjoy this?

CHRISTINE

No, of course not. I had to get

your attention, I had to make you

understand...he's not my son.

JONES

You know what your problem is? You

want to shirk your responsibilities

as a mother. You enjoyed being a

free woman, didn't you? Enjoyed

not having to worry about a young

son. You could do what you wanted,

go where you wanted, see anyone you

wanted. But then we found your

son. Brought him back. And now

he's an inconvenience. That's why

you cooked up this whole scheme, to

try and throw him to the state, let

the state raise him for you.

CHRISTINE

That's not true!

JONES

No? Even the boy says he's your

son. Why would he do that? How

would he know to do that?

CHRISTINE

I don't know! All I know is that

he's lying!

JONES

Maybe so. Maybe he is a liar. But

that's how he's been trained, isn't

it? Lying was born in both of you.

You're a liar and a troublemaker

and if you ask me you've got no

business walking the streets of Los

Angeles.

CHRISTINE

Just a minute --

JONES

Because either you know you're lying,

or you're not capable of knowing if

you're lying or telling the truth.

So which is it, Mrs. Collins? Are

you a derelict mother? Or just

nuts? Because from where I sit,

those are the only options.

CHRISTINE

I'm not going to sit here and take

this --

JONES

You want to bring in experts?

Doctors? Well, I can do that too.

(calling OS)

Matron?

JONES

Mrs. Collins...do you still insist

that the boy out there is not your

son?

CHRISTINE

Yes.

CHRISTINE

Wait...what are you doing?

MATRON

Please don't struggle, ma'am.   You'll

only hurt yourself.

JONES

(to the matron)

You are to convey the prisoner to

the Los Angeles County General

Hospital Psychopathic Ward.

CHRISTINE

No...wait, you can't --

JONES

(still to matron)

Make the following entry in the

booking department: Defendant states

she has been deceived by police and

others, and that they have given

her a boy and tried to make her

think it is her son when she says

it is not.

JONES (V.O.)

Mrs. Collins has been known to us

since about March 10, 1928, when

she reported her nine-year-old son

Walter missing.

JONES (V.O.)

The boy was gone until July, 1928.

Since his return, she has complained

that he is still missing, and has

made repeated requests that he be

found, saying, "This is not my

Walter," even though positive

identification has been established.

JONES (V.O.)

She suffers from paranoia, delusions

of persecution, and dislocation

from reality. She may be a threat

to herself or others. We recommend

that she be conveyed to the

psychopathic ward for treatment and

observation until her senses can be

restored.

MATRON

Got another code twelve.

NURSE

Name?

MATRON

Collins.   Christine.

CHRISTINE

Wait...please, this is a mistake.

NURSE

(to matron)

Certifying officer?

MATRON

Captain J. J. Jones, Lincoln Heights

division.

CHRISTINE

(forced calm)

Please...you have to listen to me.

The police are doing this to punish

me. They tried to force this boy

on me and tell me he was my son,

but it wasn't my son, and now they

say I'm crazy --

CHRISTINE

Oh, god...oh god, please, no....

NURSE

If you continue to struggle I'll

have to put you in a straitjacket.

Do you want that?

(she shakes head)

Good. Then behave yourself.

(to orderlies)

Code twelve.

CHRISTINE

No, please, you have to listen to

me...wait...please!

NURSE

Take off your clothes.

CHRISTINE

Why?

NURSE

Physical examination, body cavity

search and de-lousing. Required

for all new patients.

CHRISTINE

That's not necessary --

NURSE

You can remove your clothes yourself,

or I can have the orderlies do it

for you. Which do you prefer?

NURSE

Spread your legs.

(a beat)

Wider.

NURSE

Inside.

NURSE

This is your room. The doctor's

left for the day. He'll see you in

the morning.

CHRISTINE

The morning? But...wait, I've got

to talk to someone in authority --

NURSE

Sorry.

PATIENT

My room...no, no...this is...this

is MY room....

CHRISTINE

Then if I could just use the phone.

NURSE

Phone privileges are earned by good

behavior. You're not allowed

newspapers, magazines, radio, books

or sharp objects. This is for your

own good.

CHRISTINE

Wait...please! There's been a

terrible mistake!

PATIENT

My room. My room.       They SAID it

was MY ROOM!

CHRISTINE

I'm sorry, I --

PATIENT

MY ROOM!     MY ROOM!   MY ROOM!   MY

ROOM!

CUT TO:

YBARRA

Problem?

GORDON

Overheated, that's all.   She'll be

fine in a bit.

YBARRA

Listen, could you give me a hand?

I'm trying to find a place called

the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.

GORDON

Northcott Ranch...oh yeah. You're

almost there. Follow this west for

about two, three miles. Then the

next right. That'll bring you right

to it. Something going on?

YBARRA

Just looking into a juvenile matter.

Thanks for the help.

YBARRA

Hello?

YBARRA

Anybody home?

YBARRA

This is the police. I have a warrant

for a minor named Sanford Clark.

Open the door and stand aside.

YBARRA

Stop it! Stop it or I'll push your

face through the floor!

YBARRA

On your feet.

YBARRA

Jesus...what the hell's wrong with

you? Don't you know assaulting a

cop is against the law?

SANFORD

What difference does it make now?

YBARRA

We're just sending you back to

Canada, son, it isn't the end of

the world.

SANFORD

What?

YBARRA

You can't just stay in the U.S. as

long as you want, pal. We've got a

orders to send you back home, and --

YBARRA

Didn't know Canada was that funny.

BRIEGLEB

No word from Mrs. Collins?

(aide shakes head)

Get on down to her house, make sure

she's all right. If she's not there,

call the LAPD, see what they know.

BRIEGLEB

This is Pastor Gustav A. Briegleb

of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church,

bringing you the Lord's word on

radio KGF. Good evening.

BRIEGLEB (V.O.)

I had hoped to have a guest with us

tonight, but apparently she has

been delayed. Since she can't be

here to tell you what she told the

press this afternoon, I'll fill in

the best I can. I'm going to tell

you what happened, and I'm going to

keep telling you right here, every

night...until someone does something

about it.

GORDON

I'd like a ticket to Canada. Alberta

or Vancouver, whatever's leaving

tonight.

TICKET VENDER

Don't have anything going that far

tonight. Best I can do is put you

on a train for Seattle. From there

you can transfer to one of the locals

or drive across the border.

GORDON

That'll be fine.

TICKET VENDER

Round-trip?

GORDON

One way.

TICKET VENDER

That'll be fifteen dollars.

DISSOLVE TO:

CHRISTINE

Can I see the doctor?   Or someone

in charge --

NURSE

Breakfast is half an hour.

CHRISTINE

But I --

NURSE

Down the hall. The doctor will

call for you when he's ready.

(beat)

Go or stay, either way I lock the

door.

CAROL DEXTER

You should eat. Eating is normal.

You got to do everything you can to

look normal. That's the only chance

you've got. Besides, you'll need

the strength.

CAROL DEXTER

My name's Carol Dexter.    What's

yours?

CHRISTINE

Christine.     Christine Collins.

CAROL   DEXTER

Finish it all.    I know it's hard,

but you have to   try. Lunch isn't

as bad. Close,    but not as --

CHRISTINE

I won't be here that long. As soon

as I can talk to a doctor, they'll

realize there's been a terrible

mistake and --

CAROL DEXTER

Yeah, that always works.

(beat, quieter)

I heard them talking. You're here

on a code twelve, police action.

The doctors, the staff, they figure

that if the police sent you here,

there must be a good reason for it.

CHRISTINE

Then I'll just have to prove that

I'm not insane.

CAROL DEXTER

Yeah? How? The more you try to

act sane, the crazier you start to

look. If you smile too much, you're

delusional or stifling hysteria.

If you don't smile, you're depressed.

If you're neutral you're emotionally

withdrawn and potentially catatonic.

CHRISTINE

You seem to have given this a great

deal of thought.

CAROL DEXTER

I have. Don't you get it? You're

code twelve. So am I. We're here

for the same reason.

(beat)

We pissed off the cops.

CAROL DEXTER

What, you thought you were the only

one?

(points os)

The lady over there was married to

a cop who kept beating her up.

When she tried to tell somebody,

they sent her here. And that one?

The police beat the crap out of her

brother, broke both his arms. When

she complained to the papers, they

picked her up and...

CHRISTINE

What about you?

CAROL DEXTER

I...work nights.

(Chris doesn't get it)

I mean, I work nights. Downtown.

In some of the clubs. You know.

CAROL DEXTER

This one client started hitting me,

and he wouldn't stop. So I filed a

complaint. Turns out he was a cop.

Next thing I know, I'm here.

CHRISTINE

But how can they --

CAROL DEXTER

You're kidding right? Hey, everybody

knows women are fragile, right?

They're all emotions, no logic,

nothin' goin' on upstairs. And

sometimes, like when they say

something that's a little, y'know,

inconvenient...they just go fucking

nuts, pardon my French. If we're

insane, nobody has to listen to us.

I mean, who are you going to believe,

some crazy woman trying to destroy

the integrity of the force, or a

police officer? Then once they get

us in here, we either learn to

behave, and shut up, or --

(beat)

Or you don't go home...or you go

home like that.

CAROL DEXTER

Better finish up your oatmeal.

Want to look sane for the doctors.

Then I want to hear what they nailed

you for.

ADMINISTRATOR

Clark...Sanford Clark.

ADMINISTRATOR

Paperwork's come through. You'll

be deported back to Canada day after

tomorrow. The police there will to

decide what to do with you next. I

hope your stay here has convinced

you not to try crossing the border

illegally in future.

SANFORD

Wait, I...I want to talk to the

officer who brought me in.

ADMINISTRATOR

I'm sure he has far more important

things to do than --

SANFORD

Please.   It's important.

ADMINISTRATOR

He's off-duty until tomorrow, but...

I'll see what I can do. No promises.

DRIVER

How far you going?

GORDON

Vancouver.

DRIVER

Hop in.

DRIVER

Don't worry about that, pal. Just

a little insurance. A couple of

guys tried to hijack my truck a few

years ago so they could run booze

over the border. You can't be too

safe, you know?

GORDON

Yeah, I surely do.

STEELE

Mrs. Collins...Dr. Jonathan Steele.

Please, have a seat.

STEELE

I hope your stay has been comfortable

so far.

CHRISTINE

Fine.   Thank you.

STEELE

Really? I'd think it would be quite

difficult at first.

CHRISTINE

(catching herself)

Well, it was. Difficult, I mean.

But comfortable.

STEELE

I see they took a blood test.

CHRISTINE

Wasserman Test. To check for

syphilis. Apparently it can affect

the mind.

STEELE

The idea that someone thinks you

should be checked for syphilis...did

that upset you?

CHRISTINE

No. Not at all. I'm sure it's...

standard procedure.

STEELE

Yes. Exactly. Standard procedure.

We have to cover all bases, and --

CHRISTINE

(covering her bases)

But...at the same time...I imagine

that it would be...would probably

be upsetting to...some people that

someone else might...suspect that

of them.

(beat)

However inappropriate that might

be.

STEELE

According to your file, you believe

the police have substituted a fake

boy for your son. Is that true?

CHRISTINE

I didn't say they substituted a fake

boy, just...not the right boy.

(beat)

They brought back the wrong boy.

Not my son. He's still missing.

STEELE

That's strange...you see, I have

here a newspaper article with a

photo of you at the train station,

welcoming your son home. That is

you in the photo, isn't it?

CHRISTINE

Yes.

STEELE

So at first he was your son, but

now he's not your son.

(beat)

Has this been going on for a long

time? People...changing, becoming

something other than what they are?

CHRISTINE

People don't change, doctor.

STEELE

You don't think people change?

CHRISTINE

That's not what I --

STEELE

And the police...they're not out to

persecute you?

CHRISTINE

No.    Of course not.

STEELE

The police are here to protect us.

CHRISTINE

That's right.

STEELE

That's odd, because according to

the head nurse, when you were

admitted you accused the police of

conspiring to do this deliberately,

to punish you. So either she and

the interns are also conspiring

against you...or you're changing

your story.

(beat)

Do you often have trouble telling

reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?

ADMINISTRATOR

I'm sorry to bring you out in this

weather, detective, but the boy has

been quite insistent.

YBARRA

It's all right, I'll just see what

he has to say so I can go home and

get dry. Where is he?

ADMINISTRATOR

Room seven.

YBARRA

It's raining cats, dogs and democrats

out there, so this better be worth

it.

YBARRA

Well?

SANFORD

Look, I -- this isn't easy, okay?

YBARRA

Nothing is.

SANFORD

My cousin's Gordon Northcott. He

owns the ranch where you found me.

He let me live there in exchange

for watching the place when he was

gone, doing chores, stuff like that.

Said I could stay on as long as I

wanted to. I figured that also

meant I could leave whenever I wanted

to, but he wouldn't let me.

YBARRA

Are you saying he held you prisoner?

(sanford nods)

Bull. When I got to the ranch you

were running around free as a

jaybird. Could've left any time

you wanted. So what's this, some

kind of story to cover why you were

in the country illegally?

SANFORD

No...no, it's nothing like that.

YBARRA

Because I don't have time for --

SANFORD

Listen to me, please.    He said --

YBARRA

What?   What did he --

SANFORD

He said that if I tried to leave,

he'd kill me!

(more)

SANFORD (Cont'd)

You don't understand, you don't

know what he's like, what he...what

we did...what he made me do.

YBARRA

Okay, lets start at the beginning.

What did he make you do?

SANFORD

Him and me...me and Gordon, we...

(beat, softly)

...we killed some kids.

SANFORD

I didn't mean to, I swear...he made

me help him, said if I didn't he'd

kill me, too. Please, you gotta

help me...I'm scared...I don't want

to go to Hell for killing kids.

YBARRA

What kids?

SANFORD

I don't know...I never knew their

names.

YBARRA

How many kids?

SANFORD

All together?

SANFORD

About...twenty, I guess.

YBARRA

You're lying.

SANFORD

No, it's true, I swear!

YBARRA

Twenty kids.

SANFORD

Yeah...thereabouts...I kinda stopped

counting after a while, and Gordon

said one or two might've gotten

away, but --

YBARRA

Nobody can just up and kill twenty

kids --

SANFORD

We did...yeah, we did that....

YBARRA

How?

SANFORD

Most times we'd bring back just one

or two...sometimes as many as three.

SANFORD (V.O.)

I always knew when he was getting

ready 'cause he'd go through the

car and clean it up, make sure the

tires were good, the engine...he

was always afraid something'd break

down and we'd be caught.

GORDON

Time to go.

SANFORD (V.O.)

We'd go a different direction every

time, never hit the same part of

town twice. Sometimes we'd go for

hours, just driving around, until

we found somebody.

SANFORD (V.O.)

He'd use all kinds of different

stories. Sometimes he'd say he had

free tickets for the circus, or he

was looking for a lost dog...that

one worked real good. Other days --

GORDON

There you are, we've been looking

for you like mad.

KID

You have?

GORDON

Sure thing. Your folks, they got

in an accident. They sent us to

find you. They're hurt real bad.

The police took 'em to the hospital,

but they didn't have time to come

find you, so we said we'd do it.

Now come on, hurry...we gotta get

to the hospital, see your folks.

SANFORD (V.O.)

A lot of kids won't get in a car

alone with a stranger, but when

he's got a kid there with him, that

made it easier.

(beat)

They'd look to me, and figure if I

was safe, they would be too. That's

why he needed me, see?

SANFORD

It's okay.     Come on in.

SANFORD (V.O.)

Every time they got in the truck,

it was like I wanted to die.

GORDON

Good boy! Now hold on, it's a long

drive and we gotta fly.

SANFORD (V.O.)

Then, as soon as we got back to the

ranch...they went in the coop.

SANFORD (V.O.)

Some days he'd do 'em right off.

Other days, he'd wait, pick up a

few more, keep 'em in the coop until

he had like four or five, 'cause --

(beat)

-- 'cause he liked to hear 'em scream

all at once. Like they were some

kinda chorus. And then....

SANFORD (V.O.)

...and then....

SANFORD

Sometimes...sometimes he'd leave

one or two of 'em alive...barely

anyway...and tell me...finish 'em.

Finish 'em...or I'll finish you.

(beat)

And I did...I did...oh god...oh,

sweet Jesus...I killed 'em...I killed

'em...I killed 'em....

YBARRA

These...uhm...these kids...do you

think...if you saw them again, do

you think you'd recognize them?

(sanford nods)

Just a second.

YBARRA

I haven't updated these in a while,

but still, it should be....

(beat)

Just go through...and if you see

any faces you recognize, put it on

the table.

YBARRA

...shit....

JONES (V.O.)

He's lying.

JONES

Have you gone soft in the head,

Les?

YBARRA

Sir, I --

JONES

He's playing you! He knows he's in

trouble, so he's come up with some

cock and bull story about how he

was forced to stay in the country --

YBARRA

With all due respect, sir, I don't

think so. You didn't see him, the

kid's scared half out of his mind --

JONES

He picked the Collins kid! We found

him, remember? Haven't you been

reading the papers?

(beat)

Or maybe you have, is that it?

YBARRA

Sir, if you'd just listen --

SECRETARY

I'm sorry, captain, but he's here

again...that reverend, Briegleb.

He's asking about Christine Collins.

JONES

Tell the sonofabitch to get the

hell off police property before I

have him arrested for disturbing

the peace.

SECRETARY

I tried. He said he's not leaving...

him, or his friends.

JONES

What the hell...?

JONES

Jesus jumped down....

JONES

Ybarra? Listen. You're not to do

anything except come back here.

YBARRA

Sir, department policy requires

that all allegations of homicide

have to be investigated. And these

are kids, for chrissakes --

JONES

Departmental policy is what I say

it is, you got that? Now I'm

ordering you to get your ass back

here with that kid, you got that?

You bring him here and you talk to

no one, got it? Nobody!

YBARRA

All right, let's go.

BRIEGLEB

Are you Captain Jones?

JONES

I am.

BRIEGLEB

What the hell have you done with

Christine Collins? Don't try and

lie your way out of it. I talked

to several neighbors who saw her

being driven off in a police car.

JONES

Mrs. Collins has been placed in

protective custody following a mental

breakdown.

BRIEGLEB

A what?!

JONES

Her statements and behavior have

been found to be consistent with a

delusional state of mind that could

make her a danger to herself or

others. In the public interest, we

are looking after her son while she

gets the help she clearly needs.

BRIEGLEB

Where?

JONES

Sorry, we're withholding that

information to respect the privacy

of the family. But I can assure

you that she's getting the best

treatment available. That's all.

VOICE ON PA

Line-up for medication.    Line up

for medication....

ORDERLY

Go on.   Move up.

CHRISTINE

What for?

ORDERLY

Medication.

CHRISTINE

What kind of medication?

ORDERLY

The kind that's good for you.    Help

you relax.

CHRISTINE

I don't want to relax...I'm fine,

and I won't take something unless I

know what it is!

NURSE

Orderly --

CHRISTINE

Just listen --

NURSE

-- we can force-feed it to you if

that's what you want.

CHRISTINE

Doctor...Doctor Steele --

STEELE

I heard.

CHRISTINE

I don't know what's going on, but

I'm not taking anything until --

STEELE

I understand. Come with me.

CHRISTINE

I don't have anything wrong with me

that I should have to take

medication.

STEELE

There's nothing wrong with you.

CHRISTINE

That's right.

STEELE

You're fine.

CHRISTINE

Yes.

STEELE

Then you shouldn't have any trouble

signing this.

STEELE

By signing, you certify that you

were wrong when you stated the boy

returned by the police was not your

son. It further stipulates that

the police acted properly in sending

you here for observation and absolves

them of all responsibility for --

CHRISTINE

I won't sign it.

STEELE

Then your condition is not improved.

(beat)

Sign it, and you can be out of here

first thing tomorrow.

CHRISTINE

I won't sign it!

CHRISTINE

I was not wrong! That boy is not

my son! And I am not going to stop

telling the truth about this! And

you're not going to stop me, and

the police aren't going to stop me --

STEELE

Mrs. Collins, you're becoming

agitated.

CHRISTINE

-- I will tear down the walls of

this place with my bare hands if I

have to, but one way or another --

STEELE

Orderly!

STEELE

The patient is disturbed, hyperactive

and is threatening the staff. See

to it she is properly sedated.

CHRISTINE

No!

CHRISTINE

No, I won't let you!     Someone,

please, help me!

STEELE

Stay out of this! This is none of

your business!

(to the rest)

This is police business! You'll

stay out of it if you know what's

good for you!

STEELE

You'd think you had enough trouble

with the law just being a whore,

wouldn't you?

STEELE

CHRISTINE

Carol!   No, leave her alone!    What're

CHRISTINE

Carol....!

DISSOLVE TO:

YBARRA

It's all right, I'll take it from

OFFICER

But --

YBARRA

We need him for questioning.   Come

on....

YBARRA

You two...you've just been

requisitioned for backup. I'll

explain on the way.

CHRISTINE

You shouldn't have done that.

CAROL DEXTER

(with difficulty)

Wanted...to. Felt...good.

CAROL DEXTER

I lost...two babies...to back alley

doctors...no choice....

(beat)

Never had...the chance...to fight

for them. You do. Don't stop.

CHRISTINE

I won't...I won't.

CAROL DEXTER

Fuck them...and the horse...they

rode in on.

CHRISTINE

That's hardly appropriate language

for a lady, now is it?

CAROL DEXTER

Hell, yeah...there are times...that's

exactly the right thing to say.

CHRISTINE

And when's that?

CAROL DEXTER

When you've got...nothing left to

lose.

DISSOLVE TO:

OFFICER

All clear.

YBARRA

All right.     Show me.

YBARRA

This it?   You're sure?

YBARRA

Dig.

(off sanford's look)

You put 'em in the ground, you can

take 'em out of the ground. Go on.

OFFICER

Holy god....

YBARRA

Call it in...get the coroner and

every officer in a twenty mile radius

here inside the hour.

(more)

YBARRA (Cont'd)

Then put out an APB on Gordon Stewart

Northcott, the info is in my car.

Go on....

YBARRA

You can stop now, son.

(he doesn't)

You can stop now. It's over. We

can take it from here. It's over.

DISSOLVE TO:

STEELE

Privacy, please.

STEELE

I see you've still been refusing

medication, requiring force-feeding.

I see they switched to a rubber

tube. I hear that can quite

STEELE

Six days, Mrs. Collins, and no

progress. We may have to go to

more...strenuous therapies.

(beat)

Unless you're willing to prove you're

doing better...by signing this.

CHRISTINE

Fuck you....and the horse...you

rode in on.

STEELE

Room eighteen.

BRIEGLEB

I WANT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY IN CHARGE!

RIGHT NOW!

NURSE

Sir, please --

BRIEGLEB

WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE!

STEELE

I'm head doctor on duty.   What's

the problem?

BRIEGLEB

You the doctor who's got Christine

Collins locked up in here?

STEELE

Sorry, we don't discuss our cases

with anyone other than family --

BRIEGLEB

You'll damned well discuss this one

with me!

STEELE

Sir --

BRIEGLEB

Read it!   Read it, damn you!

NURSE

The doctor wants to see you.

STEELE

Mrs. Collins.

STEELE

One last time. Are you, or are you

not, prepared to sign that letter?

CHRISTINE

No.

STEELE

You're free to go.

CHRISTINE

...what?

STEELE

Your clothes are in the next room.

You can change there.

CHRISTINE

Next door.

STEELE

That's right.

(to the orderly)

See to it.

STEELE

Christ....

CAROL DEXTER

You're getting out?

CHRISTINE

I am out.

CAROL DEXTER

How --

CHRISTINE

I don't know...but I couldn't go

without saying goodbye --

CAROL DEXTER

Christine, don't be stupid, get out

of here fast in case they change

their mind.

CHRISTINE

I will...but I want you to know:

once I have my boy back, I'm coming

(more)

CHRISTINE (Cont'd)

back here...for you, and the others.

This is wrong, and we can stop it --

CAROL DEXTER

You are crazy.

CHRISTINE

Watch me.

REV. BRIEGLEB

I'm sorry...I didn't want you to

sorry....

OFFICER

The chief will see you now.

DAVIS

I don't know if you're aware of it,

Captain, but I have an exceptionally

good vocabulary. I'm a terror at

Scrabble, crossword puzzles, but

even I'm in awe of the vocabulary

that the press and the city council

have been exercising in reference

to this department courtesy of the

Christine Collins...incident.

(scans papers)

Incompetent. Cowardly. Bullying.

Reprehensible. Mendacious and

invidious...those two courtesy of

that prick Gustav Briegleb. Bonus

words in Scrabble, both of them.

Especially invidious. Hard to work

that one into a conversation. But

he managed it, all right.

JONES

Sir, I --

DAVIS

The key, of course, is the context

in which words like this get used.

You have to do that in scrabble,

you know, when somebody challenges

a word...show how it's used in a

sentence. So "incompetent," as in --

(reads)

"A department so incompetent that

they never realized that up to twenty

children were being kidnapped and

murdered under their very noses."

(looks over)

And here: "So incompetent that they

insisted they knew better than a

mother the identity of her own child,

forced him upon her, and then

incarcerated her when she confronted

them with evidence of their own

reprehensible behavior." That was

a two-fer. Incompetent and

reprehensible in the same sentence.

Guy must be a real terror at

crossword puzzles.

DAVIS

Captain, your handling of the Collins

case has exposed this department to

public ridicule. There is even the

potential for civil and criminal

liability.

JONES

Sir, nobody could have known what

was going on up at that ranch. Not

us, not the Sheriff's Department,

the Marshall's Office...as for the

Collins woman....

(beat)

I'm still not convinced that her

kid is among the victims up in

Wineville.

DAVIS

No?

JONES

No, sir.

(more)

JONES (Cont'd)

There were four other photos of

missing boys that looked a lot like

him...this Clark kid could have

been mistaken.

DAVIS

Maybe he was...which raises the

obvious question: so what?

JONES

Sir?

DAVIS

The Mayor wants this to go away. I

want this to go away. The way you

do that is to stop insisting that

Walter Collins was not among those

kids killed up at that goddamned

ranch. Because if the boy you

brought back isn't Walter Collins,

and he's not dead up at that ranch,

then where the hell is he? People

will want to know why we haven't

found him. Why we aren't we doing

our job.

(beat)

But if, on the other hand, he is,

or could be among those poor boys

killed up in Wineville...then the

inquiries stop. It's a momentary

embarrassment that you'll have to

live with...but better a short

inconvenience than a lingering

problem, wouldn't you say, Captain?

JONES

Yes, sir.

DAVIS

The boy's been gone for nearly a

year. If he was going to be found,

it would've happened by now. Whether

he was up at that ranch or not, the

truth is he probably is dead

somewhere. Better his mother accepts

that now rather than later, don't

you think?

JONES

Yes, sir.

DAVIS

Good.    That'll be all, Captain.

JONES

Sir, there's talk of an investigation

by the police commission.

DAVIS

Let me worry about the commission.

But it wouldn't hurt to find out

just who the fuck that kid is you

brought back from De Kalb and why

he did this, because the press bought

into his bullshit same as we did.

That we were all taken in by the

scheming little bastard may help

take some of the sting off this.

JONES

My boys are working on it now, sir.

"WALTER"

I want a glass of water.

YBARRA

Tough.

"WALTER"

(mocking)

"Tough!"

YBARRA

What's your name?

"WALTER"

Walter Collins.

YBARRA

Walter Collins is dead.

"WALTER"

(shrugs)

I didn't do it.

YBARRA

Look, let me explain something to

you. Because of your lies, you've

ruined a woman's life embarrassed

the police department, and got the

whole city up in arms over this.

"WALTER"

Got a lot done, didn't I?

YBARRA

All right, if that's how you want

it, then I guess we're done here.

(to matron)

Tell County Jail we're remanding

him for trial.

"WALTER"

Wait...what's remanding?    What trial?

YBARRA

I told you, the real Walter Collins

was murdered.

"WALTER"

So? I didn't do anything! I wasn't

even here when it happened!

YBARRA

By pretending to be Walter Collins,

you're interfering in a police

investigation of a kidnapping and

murder. We can try you as an

accomplice to murder after the fact.

(beat)

Too bad. County Jail is a lot worse

than juvenile hall or a foster home.

A lot worse.

"WALTER"

You can't do that...I'm just a kid!

YBARRA

Sanford Clark is a kid, too.

Fifteen. But he's going to jail.

All murderers and their accomplices

go to jail. Everyone knows that.

(to the matron)

Get him out of here. It's out of

my hands now.

"WALTER"

Wait!   I don't want to go to jail.

YBARRA

Prove it.

YBARRA (V.O.)

Arthur Hutchins.

YBARRA

The boy's real name is Arthur

Hutchins Junior, age twelve, a

runaway from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

JONES

Did you check the wire services?

YBARRA

Checks out. The report was filed

by his divorced mother, who lives

in Clinton, Iowa with the boy's

grandmother. Apparently he didn't

like living with the old lady, she

didn't let him get away with the

stuff he usually got away with, and

one day...he up and left.

JONES

What about the man he showed up

with at the diner?

YBARRA

Just some drifter. The boy was

hungry, ran into this guy who said

he knew how to get some food and

not have to pay for it. Only when

they finished, he left the kid behind

while he cut out. When the police

picked him up, they started going

through the wire reports about

missing kids --

JONES

And he overheard them say the name

Walter Collins.

YBARRA

Bingo.

JONES

But why that one? I mean, of all

the police departments he could've

screwed up, why Los Angeles?

YBARRA

I asked him the same question.

"WALTER"

I...I knew that Los Angeles was

where they made the Tom Mix movies.

I figured maybe I could meet Tom

Mix. Maybe he'd even let me ride

his horse.

(beat)

His horse is named Blue. Did you

know that?

DISSOLVE TO:

BRIEGLEB

How are you feeling?

CHRISTINE

A little better, thanks. The sleep

helped. Anything new outside?

BRIEGLEB

Nothing that can't wait until you're

stronger. The police still have a

car parked outside. They want to

know what your next move is.

CHRISTINE

I want to go home.

BRIEGLEB

And then?

CHRISTINE

I've been giving that a great deal

of thought ever since I got out of

that...place. All those women, and

what they did about Walter....

(beat)

They're going to just keep on doing

it, aren't they? Nothing's going

to change...unless we make it change.

CHRISTINE

I used to tell Walter, "Never start

a fight...but always finish it." I

didn't start this fight...but by

god I'm going to finish it.

BRIEGLEB

It's dangerous, and you've already

been through a great deal, Mrs.

Collins. Right now you're

sufficiently high-profile that the

police will hesitate to come after

you out in the open...but if they

see their position threatened, that

could change quickly.

(beat)

Your life could be in danger.

CHRISTINE

"Always finish it. Always."

RACHEL CLARK

Just a minute....

GORDON

Hi, sis.

RACHEL CLARK

Gordon...I didn't know you were

back in town.

GORDON

Got in a couple of days ago, figured

I'd surprise you. That okay?

RACHEL CLARK

Yes...yes, of course. Come on in.

GORDON

Where's that little niece of mine?

RACHEL CLARK

She...went into town. Should be

back this evening. Bob's here --

GORDON

Good. Need to talk to him about

staying on for a few days.

RACHEL CLARK

Staying --

GORDON

Listen, can I use your bathroom?

It's been a long ride and I could

use a shower.

RACHEL CLARK

Of course.

BOB

Is that --

(she nods, scared)

Go next door. I'll call the police.

Hurry.

MOUNTIE

Go around the other side!    Cut him

off!

SECOND MOUNTIE

Go on!   Get the bastard!

MOUNTIE

Screw this...I'm too old for this

fightin' shit....

MOUNTIE

YOU...ARE UNDER...ARREST!

BRIEGLEB

Mrs. Collins, I want you to meet a

friend of mine, Mr. Hahn.

CHRISTINE

Hello.

HAHN

Mrs. Collins. My deepest condolences

on your loss.

REV. BRIEGLEB

Can we come in?

CHRISTINE

Yes...of course.

CHRISTINE

Mr. Hahn, was it?

HAHN

Yes.

CHRISTINE

I appreciate the sentiment, but so

far they still haven't positively

identified any of the...remains...

as Walter's.

HAHN

But he was identified, was he not?

CHRISTINE

Yes, but...I guess I still can't

accept it. It doesn't feel real to

me.

HAHN

It never does. I lost a daughter

to polio five years ago. There's

not a day goes by I don't think, I

should mention this to Claudine...

then I remember she's not here.

CHRISTINE

I'm sorry.     Please, sit.

CHRISTINE

I've been on the phone all day with

the appointment secretary for the

police commission. They won't let

me testify at the hearing, or call

witnesses. They say it's not

necessary.

REV. BRIEGLEB

I know. My sources tell me the

police commission is going to come

out with a report that whitewashes

the whole thing. They're going to

say that Jones and the rest of the

LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong,

that the real blame is with the

kid...and with you, for being

difficult and forcing them to put

you away for your own safety.

CHRISTINE

Then we'll just have to hire a

lawyer...bring a civil suit and try

to get the City Council to call for

a hearing by the Welfare Board.

REV. BRIEGLEB

Jut one problem.

(more)

REV. BRIEGLEB (Cont'd)

Not one lawyer outside this room

was willing to take on the Police

Department. Too risky, they said.

So finally I went to the very best

attorney in town, a man who's sued

the city four times and won.

Unfortunately, we could never afford

to hire him.

CHRISTINE

(crestfallen)

I see....

HAHN

Which is why I'm doing this pro

bono.

(a smile)

It would be my honor to defend your

honor, Mrs. Collins. In my fifteen

years as a lawyer, I have never

seen anyone fight as long or as

hard as you have, in what is so

clearly in the cause of justice.

REV. BRIEGLEB

Now I want you to tell Mr. Hahn

here the whole story, from end to

end, leave nothing out, he'll need

it all if he's going to get the

City Council involved.

CHRISTINE

Of course. One thing, though. A

personal favor. When we've finished

here today, could you spare a few

minutes to come with me downtown.

HAHN

Of course.     Where downtown?

NURSE

Yes?   May I --

HAHN

My name is S. S.

(more)

HAHN (Cont'd)

Hahn, and I have a court order for

the immediate release of all women

being detained in this institution

under the designation Code Twelve

pending a formal inquiry into the

reasons for their detainment.

NURSE

I'm sorry, but the doctor in charge

won't be in until tomorrow morning

and --

HAHN

Let me be clearer. Either you open

those doors and produce the people

named in that court order, or you

will find yourself on the other

side of those bars...without a key.

CAROL DEXTER

I knew you'd come...I knew you'd

come back...I knew you'd come....

CHRISTINE

It's all right...everything's going

to be all right now....

REPORTER

Mr. Northcott, any comment on your

arrest?

GORDON

I'm feeling fine.

GORDON (Cont'd)

I've been on a little vacation, as

some of you know. It was a pleasant

certainly provided me with a lot of

amusement.

REPORTER

How did you avoid capture?

GORDON

Well, I didn't, did I? Didn't know

anyone wanted me until just recently.

Didn't even try. My luggage still

after you?

GORDON

No, but I figured it would be best

if I stayed out of it.

REPORTER

Anything to say to the parents of

the children you murdered?

GORDON

No comment.

DAVIS

Mayor Cryer...this is unexpected.

CRYER

So was this.

CRYER

Subpoenas, requests for depositions,

interrogatories...all courtesy of

Mr. Hahn and his new client,

Christine Collins.

(more)

CRYER (Cont'd)

You don't have to look them over

too closely, Chief, your own copies

should be arriving any time now.

(beat)

The City Council has also agreed to

look into this, starting immediately.

DAVIS

Goddamnit....

CRYER

I thought this was supposed to go

away. This is an election year, I

can't afford this kind of press.

DAVIS

It is going away, sir.   I instructed

Captain Jones --

CRYER

I'm afraid falling on his sword and

saying he made a mistake isn't going

to be good enough, Chief. If we

take him out of the picture for a

while, it might help calm things

down until the hearing's finished.

(beat)

There are several people on the

council who are planning to run

against me, and they'd love to accuse

me of allowing a renegade police

force to operate with impunity.

CRYER

Our friends in the press are having

a field day with this mess. I'm

getting five hundred phone calls,

letters and telegrams a day demanding

to know what the hell is going on

at City Hall that we allow our police

force to brutalize women and misplace

children. Christ, all this picture

needs now is for somebody to kick a

puppy for the cameras.

(beat)

This is a train, Chief, and we need

to either get in front of it, or be

run over by it.

DAVIS

Mayor Cryer...I stand by my men.

You know that.

CRYER

I do. And you know where I stand.

So the question is..are we going to

stand together...or hang together?

MAYOR CRYER

Gentlemen...gentlemen, please. As

Mayor of Los Angeles, it is my duty

to preserve the peace in our city,

which has been disrupted by recent

events in the case of Christine

Collins. As a result, we have

decided that Captain J. J. Jones of

the Lincoln Heights Division is to

be suspended from active duty,

effective immediately.

REPORTER

What's the charge, Chief?

CHIEF DAVIS

The charge is conduct unbecoming an

officer, and using improper and

abusive language toward Mrs. Collins.

It further charges that he exceeded

his authority as a police officer

by incarcerating Mrs. Collins on

the alleged charge of insanity

without sufficient cause.

REPORTER

Mayor Cryer, are you aware that the

City Council has said it plans to

open its own investigation into the

Collins case?

MAYOR CRYER

I've heard this, yes. But since

one of the main purposes of such a

hearing by the City Council would

be to suspend Captain Jones, and

since that action has now been taken,

the question is moot.

REPORTER

Which makes it look like the only

reason Jones is being suspended is

to head off the City Council

(more)

REPORTER (Cont'd)

investigation. Are you concerned

that an outside investigation might

go uncomfortably high up the food

chain?

CHIEF DAVIS

I won't even dignify that question

with a response. Good day.

CRYER

Cheer up, Chief. That little show

should take the wind out of their

sails. By Monday, this issue will

be as cold as yesterday's fish.

Never underestimate the public's

lack of attention and potential for

apathy. Old news is dead news,

you'll see.

DISSOLVE TO:

CHRISTINE

Reverend, what --

BRIEGLEB

Sorry to barge in so late, Mrs.

Collins, but it took me a while to

find the right people for the right

job. These three gentlemen are

members of my congregation who,

before coming to the Lord, had lived

lives of brutality, vice and crime.

Now they are pledged to doing god's

work...and if this isn't it, I don't

know what is.

CHRISTINE

I don't understand.

BRIEGLEB

People who bring charges against

the police have a habit of

(more)

BRIEGLEB (Cont'd)

disappearing right before the trial.

I'm a big believer in the power of

prayer, Mrs. Collins...but a little

backup from time to time never hurts.

CHRISTINE

I see...well, I...thank you.   Can I

get you anything?

BRIEGLEB

Since we don't plan on sleeping,

coffee would be lovely.

DISSOLVE TO:

BRIEGLEB

Traffic's getting heavy.   We'll go

up Spring.

BRIEGLEB

Hold on.

BRIEGLEB

Start walking. Quickly.

REV. BRIEGLEB

Almost there. Just a few more

blocks.

CHRISTINE

Where is all this traffic's coming

from...?

CHRISTINE

Excuse me, can you tell me what the

problem is up ahead?

MAN

Didn't you hear? It's the biggest

protest I've ever seen.

REV. BRIEGLEB

Protest?

OFFICER

Yeah...over that Collins broad, if

you can believe that.

CHRISTINE

He didn't mean...he couldn't mean --

REV. BRIEGLEB

I don't know...all I know is that I

think I just stopped breathing....

CHRISTINE

Oh...my....

REV. BRIEGLEB

The Lord works in mysterious ways,

Mrs. Collins.

REV. BRIEGLEB

Boy howdy, does He ever.   Come on.

THORPE (V.O.)

Ladies and Gentlemen...can I have

your attention, please....

THORPE

There are nearly one thousand people

gathered in this chamber, more than

have ever been in this room before.

THORPE

(on pa)

I therefore ask you to refrain from

demonstrations of any kind. We're

all here because we want to find

out the real facts in this case,

and everybody is going to be heard

if we have to sit here for a week.

SECOND COUNCILMAN

Mr. Thorpe, I don't see any other

members of the Police Commission.

THORPE

That's odd...we specifically

stipulated that we would begin our

hearings with testimony from the

police department. Are there any

representatives of the Police

Commission in the room?

(no answer)

Is Chief Davis here?

(no reply)

Is Captain Jones here? Is there

anyone here representing the police?

REPORTER

Mr. Chairman...Richard Thomas, The

Evening Herald. Both the Police

Chief and Captain Jones are in San

Pedro for a police inspection at a

station there.

(more)

REPORTER (Cont'd)

Only reason I know is we have a

couple of our boys out covering the

thing.

THORPE

Are you telling me they directly

violated the wishes of the City

Council? That they refused to attend

a vital hearing so they could conduct

a routine inspection in San Pedro?

And what the hell is Jones doing at

an inspection after being suspended?

(beat)

I hate to call a recess before we've

even started, but I think a few

phone calls are in order. So we'll

take a half hour break, then continue

with the witnesses who have appeared

here today. But let it be known

that Captain Jones and Police Chief

Davis will be subpoenaed and required

to appear here tomorrow morning.

HAHN

Mrs. Collins, could you come across

the street with me for just a moment?

CHRISTINE

But...shouldn't we --

HAHN

I think there's something you should

see.

HAHN

-- the police decided it was best

to keep this off the main docket in

order to avoid exactly the sort of

chaos we have across the street.

MRS. CLAY

Mrs. Collins? I'm Leanne Clay,

this is my husband, John...I just

wanted to pass on my sympathies.

What we went through, waiting to

hear anything about our son David,

was bad enough, and now this....

(beat)

But there was no call for what the

police did to you...no call at all.

BAILIFF

All rise.

GORDON

Hey...I saw you in the papers. You

got a lot of moxie, standing up to

the police like that.

JUDGE

Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have

been charged with three counts of

murder in the first degree, with an

additional seventeen counts under

review by the district attorney's

office. How do you plea?

GORDON

Not guilty, your honor.

JUDGE

In light of the defendant's penchant

for international travel, no bail

will be set. This court will receive

preliminary motions by tomorrow

morning, with a trial date to be

set for the earliest opening on the

court's calendar.

(beat)

The defendant is remanded into

custody. Bailiff....

JONES (V.O.)

The boy, Walter Collins, was reported

as missing on March 10, 1928.

JONES

We then instituted a nationwide

search. On July 10, we received a

cable indicating that a boy matching

his description had been found in

De Kalb, Illinois. Upon questioning,

he admitted to being Walter Collins,

and we made arrangements to transport

him back to California.

HAHN

Where Mrs. Collins told you the boy

was not her son.

JONES

Yes. She denied his identity in

spite of all evidence pointing to

the contrary.

HAHN

But as subsequent events have

demonstrated, she was correct. So

what prompted you to send her for

psychological evaluation?

JONES

Whether or not this was in fact the

correct boy was not relevant to my

decision. Throughout this period,

she acted strangely. She was often

cool, aloof and unemotional,

especially when presented with the

boy we located in De Kalb, and in

our subsequent conversations. It

was because of her disturbing

behavior that I submitted her for

observation to the psychopathic

ward of Los Angeles County General

Hospital.

HAHN

Just like that. You snap your

fingers and an innocent woman is

thrown into the psycho ward.

JONES

She wasn't --

HAHN

Every home in this state is in grave

danger when a Police Captain can

take a woman into his office and,

five minutes later, have her thrown

into the psychopathic ward on his

own authority!

JONES

(over the crowd)

She wasn't --

HAHN

What was that, Captain?

JONES

She wasn't thrown.     She was...

escorted.

HAHN

Escorted, thrown, the verb doesn't

matter, Captain. What does matter

is that her incarceration was ordered

without a warrant.

HAHN

I am holding a carbon copy of the

affidavit of insanity that was issued

in the case of the State of

California vs. Christine Collins.

Who signed the affidavit?

JONES

I did.

HAHN

And what is the date on this

document?

JONES

September 12th.

HAHN

But Mrs. Collins was incarcerated

on September 6th.

JONES

The form is backdated.

HAHN

Yes, so it would appear. The bottom

of the page is reserved for recording

where and when the warrant was

served. But it has not been filled

in. May I assume from this that

the warrant was never served?

JONES

That's correct. There was no need

to serve the warrant since she was

at that time already in custody.

HAHN

Let me see if I have this straight.

A woman was thrown into the

psychopathic ward without a warrant,

because no warrant existed, and

when it was finally written six

days later, there was no need to

sign it or go to a judge because

(more)

HAHN (Cont'd)

she was already in the asylum!      Is

this correct, Captain?

JONES

Technically...yes.

JONES

Extraordinary steps were necessary

because we were dealing with an

extraordinary situation! Is it our

fault that we were being deceived

by the boy who claimed to be Walter

Collins? No. In light of his claims

and her behavior, who wouldn't begin

to wonder if there was something

wrong with her?

HAHN

Because she questioned you.

JONES

Because she wouldn't listen, because

she insisted on being obstinate and

taking matters into her own hands

best left to qualified officers,

because --

HAHN

Because she was fighting for the

life of her son! A boy who may

have still been alive while you

were wasting valuable time denying

you had done anything wrong!

HAHN

And in the end, that's what happened,

isn't it? At some point, while all

this was going on, Walter Collins

died along with as many as nineteen

other youths on the Northcott Ranch

in Wineville. Is that correct,

Captain?

JONES

Yes.   It is.

HAHN

No further questions.

CHIEF DAVIS

-- so after much effort, we were

able to identify this boy, who was

has been responsible for so much

recent trouble, as Arthur Hutchins

of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Between

this, and the arrest of the man

suspected of murdering the real

Walter Collins, we have cleared up

two of the biggest mysteries in the

history of Los Angeles.

(beat)

I hope that you gentlemen of the

press will give as much space to

the good things we do as the mistakes

that are made on rare occasions.

CHIEF DAVIS

Ladies and gentlemen, let me

introduce you to the boy's real

mother, Mrs. Janet Hutchins.

MOTHER

I hope he hasn't been too much

trouble for you.

CHIEF DAVIS

Oh, no, not at all....

WRIGHT

Mrs. Hutchins...Mrs. Collins, the

woman he was staying with, wanted

him to have these. They're the

clothes she let him wear.

MOTHER

Well, thank you. Isn't that nice,

Arthur? Tell the nice officer thank

you.

"WALTER"

I don't want 'em! Give 'em to

somebody else!

DAVIS

Precocious little fellow, isn't he?

"WALTER"

It's not my fault! It was the

police! They said I was Walter

Collins, not me! It wasn't my idea!

CHIEF DAVIS

There...blame the police for your

own mistakes. We've seen a lot of

that lately, haven't we?

DISSOLVE TO:

CHRISTINE

I'm up here, Reverend.

CHRISTINE

When Walter was...when he was here,

I'd walk past his bedroom when he

was asleep, and even if I couldn't

see him, or hear him, I could...feel

him in here.

REV. BRIEGLEB

Mothers and their children are

connected in amazing ways. My uncle

joined the army during the big war,

and the day he died, before we ever

heard a word about it, my grandmother

woke up in the middle of the night

and said, "Bobby's gone." She

just...knew.

CHRISTINE

That's why I don't think Walter is

dead. I can still feel him, in

this room.

REV. BRIEGLEB

Mrs. Collins --

CHRISTINE

I know what the police said. But

the remains...what they found on

that ranch is so...most of it can't

even be properly identified. What

if that boy made a mistake when he

picked Walter's picture?

REV. BRIEGLEB

I understand that you don't want to

accept this. What mother does?

But you have to let go...and start

over. For yourself. He'd want you

to move on.

CHRISTINE

Maybe. And maybe he'd want me to

keep looking. Maybe he's waiting

for me, somewhere.

REV. BRIEGLEB

He is, Christine.

(more)

REV. BRIEGLEB (Cont'd)

In that place where we will all be

reunited with our loved ones someday.

And on that day, he will know, front

to back, end to end, heart and

soul... that you did everything you

could, Christine. Everything.

REV. BRIEGLEB

We should go.

THORPE (V.O.)

This meeting will now come to order.

THORPE

This Committee has now heard all of

the testimony, and in light of the

facts presented, issues the following

statement.

JUDGE

Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a

verdict?

FOREMAN

We have, your honor.

THORPE

While the City Council has no power

to directly remove commissioners or

(more)

THORPE (Cont'd)

the employees who serve under them,

it nevertheless can perform the

function of making recommendations.

This committee therefore reports

and recommends:

(beat)

First, that the majority members of

the Police Commission deserve the

severest condemnation for their

decision to whitewash the Collins

case.

JUDGE

Bailiff, will you bring me the

verdict of the jury?

THORPE

Second, we recommend that the

suspension of Captain Jones be made

permanent.

JUDGE

Will the defendant please rise?

THORPE

Third, that steps be taken to

investigate a change in the

prevailing laws and procedures by

(more)

THORPE (Cont'd)

which a citizen of this city can be

subjected to incarceration in the

county's mental facilities.

(beat)

Finally, restoration of public

confidence in the police department

can only be achieved by the removal

of its chief of police, and this

committee so recommends.

(beat)

This hearing is concluded.

JUDGE

You may read the verdict.

FOREMAN

We the jury find the defendant,

Gordon Stewart Northcott...guilty

on all counts of murder in the first

degree.

JUDGE

Does the defendant wish to make a

statement before judgment is passed?

GORDON

Yeah, I want to make a statement.

I want to make it real clear that I

never once got a fair shake from

you, your "honor," or this court.

The only one of you here worth a

goddamn is her --

(points to christine)

-- 'cause she's the only one never

badmouthed me to the press. She

understands what it is when the

police frame you for something you

didn't do and throw you in the hole.

Isn't that right?

GORDON

I want you to know, Mrs. Collins, I

never killed your boy. I --

JUDGE

That's enough! Counsel, you will

get control of your client or I

will have him bound and gagged.

JUDGE

Gordon Stewart Northcott, it is the

judgment of this court that you

will be conveyed to San Quentin

Prison, where you will be held in

solitary confinement for a period

of two years, until October 2nd,

1930. On that date, you are to be

hanged by the neck until dead. May

god have mercy on your soul.

CHIEF DAVIS

-- no, as I said after the hearing,

I have every intention of finishing

my term as Chief of the Los Angeles

Police Department. I will not

resign. I will fight to the finish.

The Collins case was merely an excuse

for certain politicians who have

been trying to have me removed for

some time, and I --

CHIEF DAVIS

-- anyway, I remain confident that

the Mayor's office will stand firmly

behind me. That's all.

CHRISTINE

Ten minute break?

MR. HARRIS

Of course.

MR. HARRIS

You know...one of these days you

might consider actually taking one

of these ten minute breaks. Might

be good for you.

CHRISTINE

We'll see.     Thanks, Ben.

CHRISTINE

Yes, hello, this is Christine

Collins, we spoke yesterday about

my son...fine, thank you. I was

wondering if you'd had a chance to

go through the file on runaways in

your area in case anyone resembling

Walter had --

(beat)

I see. No, thank you, I appreciate

the information. Would it be all

right if I called you again, in a

month or so? Thank you. Goodbye.

HAHN

Mrs. Collins.

CHRISTINE

Oh, hello, I was just --

HAHN

I know. That's...why I wanted to

see you.

HAHN

It's about Walter. We had...well,

we received a very strange telegram.

CHRISTINE

From who?

HAHN

Gordon Northcott.   He's...he's asked

to see you.

CHRISTINE

Why?

HAHN

He said he knows you're still looking

for your son, and before he dies --

(beat)

He says that he lied when he

testified that he didn't kill Walter.

He's willing to finally admit that

he did it. He says that if you

come up to see him, in person...he'll

tell you the truth, to your face...so

that you can get on with your life

and have some peace.

DISSOLVE TO:

HAHN (V.O.)

As you know, he's set to be executed

the day after tomorrow at San

Quentin, so....

(beat)

You don't have a lot of time.

HAHN (V.O.)

Took me most of the morning to make

all the arrangements. Turns out

you're the first woman in thirty

years the state has allowed to visit

a serial killer on the night of his

execution.

PRISON GUARD

I can stay in the room if you want,

ma'am.

CHRISTINE

No, I'm...sure I'll be fine.

PRISON GUARD

All right...I'll be right outside

the door if you need anything.

(to northcott)

Twenty minutes.

GORDON

Don't suppose you've got a cigarette?

CHRISTINE

No, I don't smoke.

GORDON

That's where they do it, you know.

That building right over there.

CHRISTINE

That's where they do what?

GORDON

The hangings. Ten o'clock tonight,

I get to see what's inside. I hear

there's thirteen steps going up to

the gallows...'cause thirteen is

unlucky. Helps make sure you're

gonna go to hell when you die. But

I got 'em beat. I outsmarted 'em.

GORDON

They're gonna let me have whatever

I want for dinner. Got a steak

coming, with spinach, mashed potatoes

and green beans. I always wondered

why they did that whole last meal

thing. One of the other guys on

Death Row said when you take the

drop, you foul yourself, and

everything you ate...comes out the

other end. So maybe that's why

they make sure you got something in

you when it happens. They like

knowing you fouled yourself on the

way to --

GORDON

Sure you don't got a cigarette?

GORDON

The warden, Clinton Duffy, he's a

good guy. He's writing a book about

all the death sentences he's carried

out in this place. Says it's called

"Eighty-Eight Men and Two Women."

Beats my record all to hell.

CHRISTINE

Mr. Northcott...you asked me to

come to see you. You said if I

did, you would tell me the truth

about my son. Well, I'm here.

GORDON

Yeah...yeah, you are. But see, the

thing is, I didn't think you'd really

come, and now --

CHRISTINE

Now what?

GORDON

I didn't expect....

(beat)

I don't want to see you.

CHRISTINE

What?

GORDON

I can't do this...I can't talk to

you...not today, not tonight, not

with what they're going to do to

me. It's one thing to send a

telegram, that's easy, but right

now, right here, in person, I --

(beat)

I can't tell you what you want to

hear, Mrs. Collins. I can't, I

can't --

CHRISTINE

Why not?

GORDON

Because I don't want to die with a

lie on my lips!

GORDON

I did my penance, I asked God to

forgive me for my sins...and I've

been good, ever since...if I commit

a sin now, if I lie now...I'm out

of time, I can't be forgiven again...

I don't want to go to hell --

CHRISTINE

Mr. Northcott...look at me.

(beat)

Look at me.

CHRISTINE

Did you...kill...my son?

GORDON

Get away from me...I don't know

anything about it!

CHRISTINE

Mr. Northcott --

GORDON

I'm innocent!

(pounds door)

Guard! Guard!

CHRISTINE

No, wait, please --

PRISON GUARD

It's okay, ma'am, they always get a

little nuts the day of.

CHRISTINE

Did you kill him? Did you kill my

son?

CHRISTINE

Mr. Northcott...Mr. Northcott!

DISSOLVE TO:

WARDEN

Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have

been found guilty of murder, the

penalty for which is death by

hanging. There have been no stays

or reprieves, therefore the execution

will go forward as stipulated under

the laws of the State of California.

Do you have any last words?

GORDON

No...nothing.

(to chaplain)

I kept clean after I confessed,

reverend...just like I said I would.

GORDON

Will it...will it hurt?

(no reply)

Please...not so fast...don't make

me walk so fast!

GORDON

Thirteen steps...thirteen steps...

but I didn't touch all of 'em, you

bastards...I didn't touch all of

'em!

GORDON

A prayer! Please, somebody, say a

prayer for me!

GORDON

Silent night...holy night...all is

calm...all is bright...round yon

virgin mother and child...holy infant

so tender and mild --

DISSOLVE TO:

OPERATOR

Hey, Chris...we're having an Oscar

party tonight at my apartment, you

want to come?

CHRISTINE

I can't...I've got a million forms

to fill out --

OPERATOR

C'mon, please, they can wait --

CHRISTINE

Sandy, you guys blew out the phone

lines between here and Baltimore,

someone has to clean up the mess,

and that's me. Besides, I've got a

radio right here, I can follow the

whole thing.

OPERATOR

You're sure?

CHRISTINE

Positive.    Go on, have fun.

CHRISTINE

I said I can't go --

MR. HARRIS

Are you sure?

MR. HARRIS

I'm meeting some friends for dinner

at Musso and Frank's on Hollywood.

They're going to pipe the Oscar

ceremony through to the restaurant.

Should be quite a night. I'd love

it if you'd come.

CHRISTINE

Ben, that's very sweet, and I wish

I could...but I really need to stay

and finish this.

CHRISTINE

Ben...? I put down two dollars on

"It Happened One Night" for best

picture. Seems I'm the only one

here who thinks it has a chance

against "Cleopatra." If I win, how

about we have dinner tomorrow night

to celebrate?

MR. HARRIS

You've got a deal, Christine.   Good

night.

CHRISTINE

'Night.

MR. HARRIS

How about I call you if you win?

CHRISTINE

I'll be here.

IRWIN S. COBB

(on radio)

Thank you. And now, it gives me

distinct honor to present the

category of Best Picture for 1934.

IRWIN S. COBB

(on radio)

The nominees are "The Gay Divorcee,"

"Here Comes the Navy," "The Barrets

of Wimpole Street," "One Night of

Love," "The Thin Man," "Cleopatra" --

CHRISTINE

Over-rated....

IRWIN S. COBB

(on radio)

"Viva Villa," "The White Parade,"

and "It Happened One Night."

CHRISTINE

Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert.   I

rest my case.

IRWIN S. COBB

(on radio)

And the Oscar for Best Picture goes

to....

(beat)

"It Happened One Night."

CHRISTINE

(calling out door)

I knew it...I knew it!   I told you

so!

CHRISTINE

Ben, it looks like dinner is on me,

I --

CHRISTINE

Yes, this is she. Mrs. Clay? No,

of course I remember you, how are

you? Is everything --

CHRISTINE

When? Where did they --

(beat)

No, of course...I'll be right there.

MRS. CLAY

I wanted to go to him right off,

but they said it was important to

talk to him alone first.

CHRISTINE

Are they sure it's --

MRS. CLAY

They're sure, but more important,

I'm sure.

(beat)

It's my boy, all right...it's David.

He's alive, Christine. They found

him up in Hysperia.

CHRISTINE

But how --

YBARRA

All right, so after you got into

the car, what happened next?

DAVID

They drove me around for a long

time, then we ended up at this ranch --

GORDON

SHUT UP!

(grinning)

I'll see you boys later....

YBARRA (V.O.)

Were there other boys present?

DAVID (V.O.)

Yeah...six, I think. It was a long

time ago.

YBARRA (V.O.)

Did you speak to them? Do you

remember any of their names?

DAVID (V.O.)

Yeah...two of them were brothers, I

think their last name was Winslow,

something like that. The oldest

was Jeffrey, I think he was around

eleven....

(beat)

...and Walter.

YBARRA

Walter.

DAVID

Yeah.

YBARRA

Do you remember his last name?

DAVID

Collins.

YBARRA

So if you only remember some of the

names of the rest, how come you

remember his full name?

DAVID

Because of what happened.

DAVID (V.O.)

Walter and Jeffrey were talking

when everybody else was screaming.

They were scared, same as the rest

of us, but they weren't scared

stupid. They kept checking around

until they found a part of the coop

where the chicken wire was all messed

up.

DAVID (V.O.)

They figured we might be able to

yank the chicken wire and bring

down the corner, maybe make enough

room to get out of there and run...

but it would make an awful lot of

noise and if it wasn't wide enough,

we'd be stuck. It might even bring

the whole place down.

WALTER

We gotta try it!

FIRST WINSLOW BOY

No!   What he hears --

JEFFREY

We have to get out of here!

FIRST WINSLOW BOY

I'm afraid!

WALTER

I'm not. I'm not afraid of

anything.

(beat)

Don't you want to go home? Don't

you want to see your mom again?

JEFFREY

Anybody else?

JEFFREY

Okay. Anybody who doesn't want to

come, get over at that end in case

this comes down.

JEFFREY

When we get out, we split up, go in

different directions, they can't

catch all of us. Ready?

JEFFREY

Pull!

JEFFREY

Go!

DAVID

Help!

DAVID

Hurry!

YBARRA (V.O.)

And that's the last you saw of him?

DAVID

That's the last I saw of any of

'em.

YBARRA

So you don't know if either of the

other two were captured?

DAVID

No. All I know is, if he hadn't

come back for me...I don't think I

ever would've gotten out of there.

YBARRA

What happened after that?

DAVID

I hid in the woods for two days,

too scared to move, because I was

sure they'd find me. I finally

started walking, but every time a

car came up I was afraid it was

them. So I kept off the main roads

until I saw a train stopped at a

crossing, and I jumped in.

YBARRA

Why didn't you tell anyone what had

happened?

DAVID

I was afraid! I thought they'd

come after me, or my folks...so I

didn't tell anybody. I was on my

own until I got a free meal from

this lady, Mrs. Lansing. I told

her I was an orphan, on my own.

She said I could stay on, and...I

did.

(beat)

Every night, I'd wake up, thinking

they were right outside my window.

Then I heard the police talking on

the radio about what happened at

the ranch, and I thought, for sure

I can't go back now.

YBARRA

Why not?

DAVID

Since I didn't tell anybody what

happened, I was afraid they'd blame

me for those kids being dead. So I

just...stayed away.

YBARRA

So what made you come forward now,

after all this time?

DAVID

I miss my mom...I miss my dad...I

just...I just want to go home.

YBARRA

Still can't believe it. Five years,

case closed, everyone thinks he's

dead...and there he is.

(more)

YBARRA (Cont'd)

And he wouldn't be, if it wasn't

for Walter.

(beat)

Your son did a brave thing, Mrs.

Collins. You should be very proud

of him.

CHRISTINE

I am.

YBARRA

You don't think he's still out there,

do you?

CHRISTINE

Why not? Three boys made a run for

it that night, Detective. If one

got out, maybe either or both of

the others did too. Maybe Walter

went through the same fears he did.

Afraid to come home or identify

himself, afraid he'd get into

trouble, that people might think it

was his fault. Either way, it gives

me something I didn't have before

tonight.

YBARRA

What's that?

CHRISTINE

Hope.

FADE OUT:

THE END
