PROLOGUE

FRANCES (V.O.)

No one ever came up to me and said,

'You're a fool. There isn't such a

thing as God. Somebody's been stuffing

you.'

FRANCES (V.O.)

It wasn't a murder. I think God just

died of old age. And when I realized

He wasn't any more, it didn't shock

me. It seemed natural and right.

FRANCES (V.O.)

And yet I began to wonder what the

minister meant when he said, 'God,

the Father, sees even the smallest

sparrow fall. He watches over all

his children.' That jumbled it all

up for me.

FRANCES (V.O.)

But still sometimes I found that God

was useful to remember, especially

when I lost things that were

important. 'Please God, let me find

my red hat with the blue trimmings.'

FRANCES

It usually worked. God became a

superfather that couldn't spank me.

But if I wanted a thing badly enough,

He arranged it.

FRANCES

But if God loved all of His children

equally, why did He bother about my

red hat and let other people lose

their fathers and mothers for always?

ERNEST

Bye, baby.

FRANCES

See you next weekend, Dad.

FRANCES

I began to see that He didn't have

much to do about hats or people dying

or anything. They happened whether

He wanted them to or not, and He

stayed in Heaven and pretended not

to notice.

DISSOLVE TO:

FRANCES

I wondered a little why God was such

a useless thing. It seemed a waste

of time to have Him. After that He

became less and less, until He was...

nothingness.

FRANCES

I felt rather proud that I had found

the truth myself, without help from

anyone. It puzzled me that other

people hadn't found out, too. God

was gone. We had reached past Him.

Why couldn't they see it? It still

puzzles me.

WOMAN

You're going straight to hell, Frances

Farmer!

SMASH CUT TO:

KAMINSKI

And do you think it's radical for a

man to have a job and feed a family?

YORK & CROWD

No!

KAMINSKI

Is it radical for you to have a hand

in shaping your future, and the future

of your children?

YORK & CROWD

No!

KAMINSKI

Is it radical for the wealth of this

country to be turned back to the

people who built the country?

YORK & CROWD

No! No!

KAMINSKI

Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!

FADE TO BLACK:

ANNOUNCER

Seattle is in the news again as a

high school junior wins a national

competition and a hundred dollar

prize with an essay denying God.

ANNOUNCER

This prompts civic officials to charge

that left-wing politicians are

encouraging atheism in the city's

schools. Miss Frances Farmer was

unavailable for comment, but her

mother Lillian --

ANNOUNCER

Farmer, a well-known local dietician,

stepped to her daughter's defense.

LILLIAN

(emphatically)

Frances has not turned her back on

the Lord, they're just having a

momentary difference of opinion.

What child hasn't questioned the

Lord's mysteries in order to better

understand them? To paraphrase Mr.

Voltaire, I may not agree with what

she says, but I'll defend to the

death her right to say it. Freedom

of speech, unlike in the dark

countries to the east, still lives

in America! And in my home.

FRANCES

Hi Emma.

FRANCES

Bye Emma.

MAN'S VOICE

Hey!

HARRY

(friendly)

C'mere. I wanna talk to you.

HARRY

Momma told ya not to speak to

strangers, huh?

(reaches her, grabs

her arm)

Hey!

FRANCES

Don't touch me.

HARRY

I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna

talk.

FRANCES

(waiting)

Okay then...

HARRY

Well... you're causin' trouble, you

know that?

FRANCES

I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain

in the butt! You newshounds've been

after me and my folks ever since I

won that dumb contest. I'm just

sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares

what I think?

HARRY

Not me. But other people seem to.

FRANCES

Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in

the papers -- nobody'd even know

about it.

HARRY

Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I

look like a newshound to you?

FRANCES

(examining him)

No... Actually, you look more like a

cop.

HARRY

That's rich. Hey, if I was a cop,

I'd be packing, right?

(holding coat open)

You see a gun? Go on, search me. Pat

me down.

FRANCES

I'll... take your word for it. So

who are you, then?

HARRY

Harry York. I work for Martoni

Kaminski, he's running for Congress

here.

FRANCES

(smiles & points to

him)

Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!

HARRY

(embarrassed)

Yeah, well --

FRANCES

You know, my Dad's done some work

for Kaminski...

HARRY

Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna

get your Daddy in hot water, do you?

FRANCES

Whattaya mean?

HARRY

Well... see the papers've got us

pegged as pinkos, then you come along,

the friendly neighborhood atheist --

FRANCES

But I'm not. The newspapers're --

HARRY

Right again. You're no more an atheist

than my man's a Red, but what they're

doin', see, they're addin' up their

version of your ideas with their

version of ours. Could look bad for

your Daddy.

FRANCES

Yeah. Could look bad for you and

Kaminski too, I guess.

HARRY

Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.

FRANCES

Well aren't you the smoothie. Now

you're going to ask for my number, I

suppose.

HARRY

I suppose not. Gotta ask you this,

though: for all our sakes, you better

keep your trap shut.

FRANCES

Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.

HARRY

Harry.

FRANCES

(hesitates, nods)

Harry.

HARRY

Bye.

HARRY

(admiring her)

Sure don't walk like sixteen, neither.

HILLIER

These are perilous times. With the

economic collapse comes hopelessness

and desperation; and people turn to

dangerous ideas --

WOMAN'S VOICE

I know.

HILLIER

Those of us who represent law and

order must be vigilant. Who's behind

this, her mother?

STYLES

Impossible. As her attorney, I've

known her for years.

HILLIER

What about the father, he's a little

pink. Maybe he wants to show our

schools in a bad light, shift some

support to Kaminski and those jackals.

STYLES

(shaking her head)

He's no influence; he doesn't even

live at home. No, I think Frances

wrote that essay with no mischief

intended. It was her teacher who

entered it in the competition.

HILLIER

Well, the publicity must stop. It's

no good for Seattle and no good for

the country.

(sternly)

Keep an eye on this, will you, Alma?

STYLES

Of course, your honor.

ERNEST

It always amazes me, Lil, how you

can whip up a hot, hearty meal out

of thin air.

LILLIAN

I can thank you for that. It was a

hard-earned talent.

LILLIAN

(offering to Ernest)

Bread?

ERNEST

(taking a piece)

Thank you.

LILLIAN

When's the last time you saw a hundred

dollars, Ernest Farmer?

FRANCES

Mama...

LILLIAN

(pushing back her

plate)

I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy

yourselves. After all, this is a

celebration.

ERNEST

I'm... I'm really proud of you,

Frances.

FRANCES

Thanks, Dad.

ERNEST

An essay contest... a national

contest. That's pretty impressive.

FRANCES

I didn't have much to do with it.

ERNEST

You wrote it, didn't you?

FRANCES

Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry

York?

ERNEST

Well, Harry York is a guy who...

well, he does a lot of things. Why

do you ask?

FRANCES

He talked to me today. Told me to

keep my mouth shut or I'd get

everybody in trouble.

ERNEST

Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry

York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski

right now, and... well... There are

lots of folks in this country who

never got a square break. That's the

way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants

to change it, and when it comes to

new ideas, the people in power get

nervous.

FRANCES

Is Kaminski a Communist?

ERNEST

No, no, no. All he wants to do is

see the common man get a little

representation.

FRANCES

He's a socialist, then?

ERNEST (V.O.)

The label's not important, Francie.

What's important is: this country's

got nine million unemployed and

something's gotta be done about it.

Besides: left-wing, right-wing, up-

wing, down-wing... they don't mean

much. All a label is usually is a

way to call somebody a dirty name.

FRANCES (V.O.)

It's already started, Dad... with

me.

ERNEST (V.O.)

I know.

FRANCES

And I can't understand how it can

hurt to be honest, but the more I

tried to explain --

(what I meant)

LILLIAN

Don't listen to him, little sister.

When you're proud of what you are,

you don't refuse the label,

understand?

FRANCES

Yes, Ma.

LILLIAN

And you... should be proud. You won

that contest and made a name for

yourself.

LILLIAN

You're poisoning that child's mind.

ERNEST

I have a right to talk to her. She's

my daughter, and she's beginning to

understand why I've sacrificed so

much in order to achieve...

LILLIAN

You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice

law for decent folk instead of

Communists and indigents --

ERNEST

They need help, Lil. They pay me

back in other ways.

LILLIAN

How? What do they do for you, Kaminski

and his friends? They're all

anarchists! Traitors!

ERNEST

(sadly)

No, Lil. It's just you can't

understand their brand of patriotism.

LILLIAN

That's right. I can't understand a

man who puts strangers over his

family, a man who gives up a good

career to become a shiftless inkhorn

failure.

ERNEST

I'm going back to the hotel.

LILLIAN

Good.

ERNEST

See you next weekend?

LILLIAN

As usual. Everything as usual, Mr.

Farmer. Just give me my due.

ERNEST

Lillian... I'm more than willing to

meet you halfway.

LILLIAN

Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown

myself in Puget Sound.

ERNEST

(under his breath)

That's a thought, Lil. That sure is

a thought.

NEIGHBOR'S VOICE

Are you all right, dear?

LILLIAN

I'm fine, perfectly fine.

FRANCES

Dad, please, don't leave early. Just

because of Mama --

ERNEST

Francie, you'll learn that sometimes

it's best to stay low and just walk

away.

FADE TO BLACK:

FRANCES

What can we do, we must live! We

shall live, Uncle Vanya...

FRANCES

And then we shall rest, we shall

rest. We shall hear the angels, we

shall see the whole sky all diamonds,

we shall see how all earthly evil,

all our sufferings, are drowned in

the mercy that will fill the whole

world. And our life will grow

peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress...

(wipes away tears)

Poor, dear Uncle Vanya, you are

crying...

(through her tears)

In your life you haven't known what

joy was; but wait, Uncle Vanya,

wait... We shall rest...

(embraces him)

We shall rest!

HARRY

(to himself)

Not bad, Farmer. Not half bad.

DRAMA TEACHER

Art is a constant struggle. Some of

you have the will but not the ability.

For others, the opposite. I don't

wish to be harsh, but only one of

you on stage tonight combined the

two...

DRAMA TEACHER

On cue.

GIRL #1

I could really learn to hate her.

GIRL #2

Stand in line.

DRAMA TEACHER

This is the answer: a subscription

drive to "Voice of Action!" First

prize is a trip to Moscow! You could

visit the art theatre, maybe even

meet Stanislavski!

FRANCES

But I'll never win that.

DRAMA TEACHER

Yes, yes, it's all arranged.

Everyone's collecting subscriptions

in your name. And the best part is:

the trip returns you to New York.

FRANCES

(intrigued)

Really?

DRAMA TEACHER

New York, Frances! Broadway! This is

your chance! You belong on the stage!

FRANCES

(flattered/embarrassed)

Thank you.

FRANCES

Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?

HARRY

You think I'd miss it?

FRANCES

Well? What'd you think?

HARRY

(shrugs)

I just wanted to see how you looked.

FRANCES

How'd I look?

HARRY

(teasing)

Enh.

FRANCES

(smiling)

Don't be a rat, Harry.

HARRY

You looked okay.

(glances around)

Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I

take you home?

FRANCES (V.O.)

You really think so?

HARRY

Honest. When you were up there, you

were really... there, know what I

mean? Everyone else looked stupid.

FRANCES

I don't know... I did... feel

different... Alive.

HARRY

Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do

something with it.

FRANCES

Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll

kill me. She hates Russians. I do

want to go, though... to New York,

especially... but I wanted to do

it...

HARRY

What?

FRANCES

Quietly.

HARRY

You're not the quiet type, Frances.

HARRY

You know, my old man was an inventor.

Spent his whole life down in the

basement trying to design

transcontinental underground

railroads, stuff like that. Well, I

was supposed to be his partner. When

I told him the smell of his workshop

made me sick, I thought he was going

to die right there.

FRANCES

What happened to him?

HARRY

He retired to Florida... made a

killing in vending machines.

HARRY

I kick myself sometimes, but the

thing is, I would have been miserable

living his life.

FRANCES

...So you think I should go.

HARRY

Sure. Try this acting thing. You can

make good money at it.

FRANCES

I don't know, Harry. I... I want so

many...

HARRY

You don't know what you want.

FRANCES

Yeah.

FRANCES

Not in the long run, anyway.

HARRY

Frances...

FRANCES

What?

HARRY

Well... don't you think it's up to

me to...

FRANCES

Come on, Harry. This is America,

land of the free.

(whispers)

I thought we might go skinny dipping.

(pregnant pause...

smile...)

For starters.

LILLIAN

Communists?! No daughter of mine is

going to Communist Russia!

FRANCES

You act like I'm a bomb-thrower,

Mama. It's just a trip.

LILLIAN

But they're using you!

FRANCES

Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's

just a chance to travel, see things.

Besides, it's the only way I can get

to New York.

LILLIAN

I'll pay your way to New York. I'll

work, I'll slave. I'll sell my

vegetables to the truck farmers, or --

FRANCES

(sighs)

Oh, Mama, don't you understand?

FRANCES

I have to do this on my own. You

see, I've learned your lesson very

well. To do what I think is right

and everyone else be damned.

LILLIAN

I never taught you that!

LILLIAN

Little sister, if you don't wise up

soon, it's going to be out of my

hands!

FRANCES

It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's

my life.

LILLIAN

Yes, but important people are

concerned about this. Judge Hillier

spoke to Alma Styles --

FRANCES

I don't care.

LILLIAN

(grimacing)

...You will.

FRANCES

What do I do, Dad?

ERNEST

You really want to go?

FRANCES

Of course.

ERNEST

And you think it's worth all this?

FRANCES

If I didn't, I wouldn't put you

through it.

ERNEST

...Then go.

LILLIAN

(almost conspiratorial)

The authorities tell me there's no

legal way I can stop her, but the

way I see it, it's bigger than me or

my family...

(the following is

heard faintly as

b.g. to the scene

below)

American integrity, that's what's at

stake here. They're sending my

daughter to the heartland of darkness.

. .the dark forces that would

overthrow our country. Your country.

My country.

REPORTER #1

Has your earlier denial of God led

you to Communism?

FRANCES

I'm not a Communist.

REPORTER #2

But Frances, you said --

FRANCES

I said all countries are of cultural

interest. Besides, Russia has the

greatest theatre company in the world.

REPORTER #2

Better than any American company?

REPORTER #1

What do you think of Stalin?

FRANCES

Not much. Ask me about Stanislavski.

REPORTER #2

Who?

LILLIAN

(suddenly frantic,

loud)

Help me save my daughter! Save the

children of America.

TALL SPECTRAL MAN

Repent, Frances, Repent!

CROWD

Repent! Repent!

TALL SPECTRAL MAN

Bless you, sister, bless you.

(dignified, as though

conducting some

bizarre ceremony)

Here is a Bible for solace... and

this plant to remind you of the

eternal seed in all of us... and

finally, a flashlight to illuminate

your path through darkest Russia.

FRANCES

I love you, Mama.

(turns to her father)

I love you, Dad.

ERNEST

(hugging her)

Be careful, Francie.

LILLIAN

Frances, I'm warning you. I'm gonna

throw myself beneath the wheels.

I'll do it, Frances. Frances!

Hobbies?

FRANCES

Oh, I swim some... play the piano

badly... and I read like a fiend: I

like history.

PUBLICIST

No, no, people don't want that. Now

listen: you spend lots of time at

the beach. You're crazy about dancing.

And you're the kind of girl who's

just a little in love with love. Get

it? Now try again? Hobbies?

FRANCES

Look, I...

PUBLICIST

(writing in notepad)

Beach... dancing... in love with

love.

FRANCES

(ironically)

That's me.

CLAIRE

Good morning, Mr. Bebe!

BEBE

Who's this?

CLAIRE

Frances Farmer, contract player, six-

month option.

BEBE

(an assessment)

Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them

off a little more?

CLAIRE

I guess so, sir.

BEBE

(nods, stares again

at Frances)

Very fine bone structure.

PUBLICIST

(coming up to Claire)

Not much to work with. How's this:

(reading)

'The most interesting thing about

Frances Farmer is that her road to

Hollywood was 12,000 miles long.

After winning a beauty contest, the

first prize of which was a trip to

Europe...' She made some deal with

the Commies and went to Moscow, but

I'm not going to say that, am I?

CLAIRE

Heavens no. Go on.

PUBLICIST

Um... 'Miss Farmer returned to New

York City and had a brief fling with

the Broadway stage before coming

west to seek stardom.'

CLAIRE

'Brief fling?'

PUBLICIST

Well, actually she couldn't get hired,

but lucky for her, some guy in our

New York office saw her. She says

soon as she gets a stake, she's going

back.

FRANCES

Did you get the check?... Oh my God,

it opened?!, what'd you think?

FRANCES

Well, I hope I get bigger parts,

they don't come much smaller.

FRANCES

No, I'm fine. I just have water in

my mouth.

FRANCES

No, Mama, I'm not changing my name.

They can't actually make you, you

know? Most people don't realize that.

(playfully, covering

receiver)

Oh Dick...

FRANCES

No, no, nothing's going on.

(fast)

I love you too, Mama. Give my love

to Dad. Bye!

FRANCES

Okay, handsome. You win.

FRANCES

Kurt!

FIRE CHIEF

Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers!

They'll lead you safely down the

mountain...

FRANCES

But, Kurt, I...

FIRE CHIEF

No, No arguments. Be my good girl

and go. There's a forest, a burning

forest, and you know what I have to

do!

FRANCES

Oh, Kurt!

FIRE CHIEF

Oh Angela, my own... Angela!

FRANCES

I'm sorry...

(looking into camera)

I'm sorry, let's go back.

What the hell is that? What's she

LAUGHING MAN

That's talent, Andy.

MAN #1

(after a beat)

Oh.

FRANCES

Harry! Harry-god-damn-York! A real

person!

HARRY

How ya doin', Farmer?

FRANCES

Me? Look at you! What're you doing

in Hollywood?

HARRY

Came to get a tan.

FRANCES

Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's

the real reason?

HARRY

(staring out)

Kaminski.

FRANCES

Yeah, I read about that. Terrible

business, suicide.

HARRY

Since when do you believe the papers?

They killed him, kid.

FRANCES

What?

HARRY

They killed him. They threw him out

that window.

FRANCES

Oh no...

HARRY

Eight stories.

FRANCES

Jesus.

HARRY

(also staring down)

Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the

sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too

god damn much heart. He just didn't

want to die.

FRANCES

(walking on)

But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they

do it?

HARRY

(shrugs)

He wouldn't play ball. What can I

tell ya... it's done.

(brightening)

Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so

I skipped town; came down here to

work for some big-wig. Tail and nail

job.

(confidentially)

I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non-

gentleman.

(turns around,

displaying his shirt)

How d'ya like the camouflage?

FRANCES

You jackass!

(pushing him down the

stairs)

C'mon, let's get out of here.

FRANCES

Not bad. It was slow at first, but

I'm doing bits now.

HARRY

I always told ya, Frances. You got

real ability.

FRANCES

(smiling)

I know what ability you're interested

in.

HARRY

Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya

say we have dinner, then maybe head

out to the beach, rub some of this

tan off each other.

(off her sober

expression)

For old time's sake.

FRANCES

(serious)

Harry... I met someone.

HARRY

(stiffens slightly)

Yeah? What is he -- muscleman?

Lifeguard?

HARRY

Actor?

HARRY

Good. Then it's temporary.

(whispers)

All actors are phonies.

HARRY

Serious, huh?

FRANCES

Yeah.

HARRY

Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.

FRANCES

(spreading her arms)

These creases... I look like I just

came from the laundry! I'm supposed

to be hiding out in boxcars, sleeping

on floors.

WARDROBE MISTRESS

(cool)

This is the suit we fitted on you,

Miss Farmer.

FRANCES

(friendly)

Oh, I know that. But it could look

more realistic, don't you think?

WARDROBE MISTRESS

(looking her over)

It'll do. No one will notice.

FRANCES

I'll notice.

WARDROBE MISTRESS

Oh, Mr. Bebe, good morning.

BEBE

Come along with me, Fanny.

FRANCES

That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.

BEBE

(leading her off)

You see: We've got to change that

name.

BEBE

I like your looks. You have the

classical bone structure of the very

great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --

FRANCES

Thank you --

BEBE

I intend to make a great deal of

money off you.

BEBE

Since we have you on a seven year

contract, I'm planning long-range.

I'm going to loan you out to Sam

Goldwyn to make a picture called

"Come and Get It."

FRANCES

Really? That's a very good book.

It'd make a terrific --

BEBE

Never mind that. I'm concerned about

you. Your attitude.

BEBE

Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer,

and people have to buckle down, do

their jobs. You see, I view myself

as the Henry Ford of motion picture

industry, and I can't have the fellow

who puts on the wheels arguing with

the man who installs head-lights,

now can I?

FRANCES

But I'm concerned with everything,

Mr. Bebe.

BEBE

(fierce but very muted)

No, I'm concerned with everything.

FRANCES

But I'm the one up there on the

screen.

BEBE

That's right. You're an actress,

Miss Farmer and your job is to act.

FADE OUT:

HARRY

(puffing his cigarette)

Not bad, Farmer.

LILLIAN

I guess it's no secret that I'm proud.

Only twenty-one years old, and look

at all she's done.

(confidentially)

As for her looks, I flatter myself

that she gets them from me.

DICK

Obviously.

LILLIAN

And not only has Frances come home a

star; she's also brought me this big

handsome lug of a son-in-law!

REPORTER

Mr. Farmer, what was your reaction

when Frances told you she had

married...

DICK

Dwayne. Dwayne Steele.

ERNEST

What...? Oh. Well, I was pleased, of

course. Richard... uh, Dwayne, is a

real gentleman.

DICK

Well, all I can say is: I feel like

I've known these two for years!

LILLIAN

(girlishly)

Oh, Dwayne!

(overcome)

This is like a fairy tale!

FRANCES

What'd he say?

Let's go. We'll be late.

A little strange.

How's the movie, Frances?

FRANCES

It's okay.

LILLIAN (O.S.)

Smile, little sister, smile.

REPORTER #1

Can you make some statement about

Seattle, how the city helped you, or

the schools --

FRANCES

Well, the truth is the city had

nothing to do with it. I was lucky.

And what wasn't luck was hard work.

(disappointed)

Oh.

Miss Farmer, I can't tell you how

Excuse me.

JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE

(startled)

Yes...?

FRANCES

Don't I know you?

JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE

I don't believe so.

FRANCES

Sure. You shouted at me in the

auditorium when I read my essay.

JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE

No, my dear. You must be mistaken.

FRANCES

(barely audible)

Oh bullshit.

JUDGE HILLIER

I beg your pardon?

FRANCES

(to the dignitaries)

Listen, I'm still the same girl that

wrote that essay, the same girl who

went to Russia, and you people aren't

proud to meet me at all.

HARRY

...It's one thing to marry the guy,

but did you have to sleep with him?

HARRY

Shit. I meant the other way around.

FRANCES

(still laughing)

Well, the studio told me not to.

HARRY

Is that why you did it?

FRANCES

Who ever thought they'd be right for

once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo

back there --

HARRY

You're telling me.

FRANCES

Dick... and my mother! She acts like

she's on Mars or something --

HARRY

Well, she's back to earth now. They're

all pretty huffed up about your

leaving. I think you better go back,

kid.

FRANCES

Forget it.

FRANCES

You know, the funny thing is: it's

not a great movie. I mean it could've

been, but they screwed it up, gave

it a happy ending. And all my friends,

I know they're going to smile and

say they loved it.

HARRY

If they say they love it, they'll

probably love it. Not everybody lies,

you know?

FRANCES

(warmly, to him)

No, they don't, do they?

HARRY

Frances, you're a movie star now. If

you give them what they want, you

can get anything.

FRANCES

I don't have what they want, Harry.

(stares at the water)

Harry, will you tell me something?

How can I keep making movies when

people in the streets are starving?

HARRY

Some people starve, kid. Until we

can do something about it, they might

as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel

better.

FRANCES

But I don't want to be like that. I

want to do something...

(important)

HARRY

What're you gonna do, waste your

talent? Why not use it to make

something worthwhile. You can do

that, you know?

FRANCES

(laughs)

Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass

of myself.

HARRY

Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo.

Let me drive you up to that red carpet

in my beat up Chevy.

FRANCES

The hell you will, Harry York.

HARRY

Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin

awaits.

FRANCES

(like a clock striking)

Bong... bong... bong...

HARRY

Don't start, Farmer.

FRANCES

(dropping her scarf)

It's midnight, Harry. My glittering

raiments are dissolving.

HARRY

(nervously)

The chauffeur. He's watching.

FRANCES

He deserves a show. He missed the

movie.

HARRY

I'm serious, Frances. This is

important.

FRANCES

(kicking off a shoe)

I know.

FRANCES

A single glass slipper left glittering

on the pearly sands. Who was that

girl, anyway?

FRANCES

'Come and get it,' Harry.

HARRY

(excited)

Hot damn!

CLAIRE

Hi Frances, got a minute?

FRANCES

Sure, Claire. If you don't mind

walking my way.

CLAIRE

(nervous)

Well, I suppose I should just say

it. It's your clothes.

FRANCES

(bewildered)

My clothes?

CLAIRE

Yeah, I mean slacks... and work

clothes... and that awful car --

FRANCES

It's a perfectly good car. It runs.

CLAIRE

Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound...

it's just that the public expects

something different from its stars.

People won't take you seriously.

FRANCES

I don't care if my clothes are taken

seriously. Or my car.

CLAIRE

You know what I mean.

FRANCES

Uh-huh. You mean what if the public

finds out I perspire? And wear slacks.

And drive an old jalopy? What if

they find out I'm a real person. Oh

no! Say it ain't so! Not a real

person!

FRANCES

Morning, Eddie.

CLAIRE

That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is

very concerned about your politics.

He hears you've been donating money,

speaking at rallies.

FRANCES

Yup. Claire... please, please tell

Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as

much about his scripts as he does

about my private life, we'd make a

lot better movies.

CLAIRE

I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you

know?

FRANCES

I know.

(imitating Bebe)

'This is a factory and we each have

our jobs. The writer writes, the

director directs, and the actress...'

CLAIRE

(laughing)

...acts. I'll relay your message.

DICK

Yes, of course she'll make a statement

on women's rights. Call back tomorrow,

okay?

DICK

(pointedly)

Dwayne Steele's residence.

DICK

Yes.

(confused)

What...?

(hurt)

Yes. Yes, I'll tell her.

DICK

You learn your lines?

FRANCES

(nods drowsily)

Sort of.

DICK

There've been some calls.

FRANCES

Who?

DICK

Well... about half an hour ago that

woman from the talent department

called, what's her name?

FRANCES

Claire?

DICK

Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired.

Too bad, huh?

FRANCES

(apprehensively)

Fired?

DICK

Yeah. She said she delivered your

message and that you'd understand.

DICK

There was another call too. From

your agent. He says your summer stock

deal is all set. So you're going

back east, huh?

FRANCES

...Yes.

DICK

Without me.

FRANCES

(sighing)

Showdown.

DICK

You weren't going to tell me, were

you? Just pack up and leave, is that

it?

FRANCES

Dick, we need some time apart --

DICK

Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you

know. I can see you're going sour on

me, and when I try to do something

about it, you turn your back and say

it's nothing.

FRANCES

Dick, I can't even breathe here...

DICK

Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn

well better get used to it!

FRANCES

(softly, remembering)

Dick...

DICK

I don't suppose it occurred to you

that I might want to leave too, that

I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause

you don't want me along, do you? And

the reason has nothing to do with

summer stock.

FRANCES

No?

DICK

No. It's all about that night, isn't

it?

FRANCES

(bewildered)

What night?

DICK

The premiere. I never pressed you

about it but god damn it, you're

gonna tell me right here and right

now what happened and where the hell

you were!

FRANCES

(quietly)

You want his name?

DICK

What...?

FRANCES

My God... I think you're overplaying

this a bit...?

FRANCES

Goodbye, Dick.

FADE OUT:

CLURMAN

The Group is more than a theatre

company. It's the embodiment of an

ideal. Our approach allows the actor

to be an artist in the fullest sense,

a creative individual and an

instrument of change. You see --

FRANCES

(watching Odets)

Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have

to sell me.

CLURMAN

Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always

lecture those who are on time for

those who are tardy. The point is,

Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful

play. Most of the roles are cast,

but we haven't found our female

lead...

FRANCES

Who is she?

ODETS

She's a tramp from Newark.

CLURMAN

Forgive me, but I think you'd be

perfect for the part.

ODETS

Miss Farmer, for me this is not a

play: it's an assault... a

seduction... a plea for understanding.

I think we live in a time when new

art works should shoot bullets...

and you make very attractive

ammunition.

FRANCES

And what's the title of this seduc...

assault?

ODETS

(mysterious, intimate)

'Golden Boy.'

FRANCES

Hi.

FRANCES

You wanted to talk?

ODETS

You see that girl?

ODETS

That's who my play is about.

FRANCES

That's me, Clifford.

ODETS

(strong)

I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's

there, Frances, the fire is there,

but it's not coming through. You're

lazy --

FRANCES

I'm not!

ODETS

Yes, you win them, you bring them

into your heart, touch them, but you

don't set them on fire!

FRANCES

But I want to. I'm trying!

ODETS

I need an incendiary! An arsonist!

FRANCES

Then show me! That's what I'm here

for, to learn, to grow!

ODETS

Good. Then it's very simple. You

have to stop being afraid, Frances.

It's in you.

ODETS

I can see it. You just have to let

it out. Trust it. No one will quash

you here, but it's still a fight, a

struggle! Being true to your art,

being honest, is always a struggle!

CLURMAN

...Not only an artist, but an

instrument of change. We must look

to the world around us, not content

to observe, but to take an active

hand in redressing its wrongs. We

will not stand idly by as Fascist

bombs obliterate democracy. We

contribute our profits, for if fascism

is not stopped in Spain, it will

spread across Europe, jeopardizing

the struggle of civilized man to

survive.

(presenting check to

SPANISH CONSUL)

The artist, to be vital, must be a

soldier too.

FRANCES

I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.

CLIFFORD

Yes you are. We all are. The first

step is to acknowledge our fear.

CLIFFORD

Face it! Confess it! You're weak!

FRANCES

I'm not!

CLIFFORD

You're afraid!

FRANCES

I'm not!

CLIFFORD

You don't want to show your whole

soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful --

you don't want to show it --

FRANCES

(angry)

God damn it, Clifford, will you shut

up! I tell you, I want to give these

things! I want to give them to the

audience, and I can give them, I

will give them, so shut up!

CLIFFORD

Good, good. Give them that.

FRANCES

What?

CLIFFORD

Madam...?

FRANCES

Thank you.

CLIFFORD

Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad.

I can't go through with this. My

wife is in Europe, but this is her

house...

(gesturing off)

her bedroom. I can't ask you to...

FRANCES

(playing along)

Oh well. I guess I better leave then.

CLIFFORD

Okay, but come here first.

FRANCES

Huh.

CLIFFORD

(Leading her down

hall)

Come here. I want to show you

something.

LAWYER

And on top of her political

activities, now she's got a lawyer.

She wants out of her contract, Mr.

Bebe. She says she's through with

motion pictures.

BEBE

(muttering)

I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't

me...

LAWYER

Excuse me, sir?

BEBE

I don't know who she fucked to get

where she is, but I don't think it

was me.

LAWYER

(startled)

Well... you could always dump her,

Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There

are a million beautiful girls out

there who don't give a damn about

politics.

BEBE

That's not the point. Frances Farmer

has the world by the tit because of

this studio, and now she thinks she

can waltz off without a thank you.

No. No, that young lady has a

contract, and she's going to honor

it.

LAWYER

Oh. I mean, good.

BEBE

I think it's time to take the gloves

off.

(scowls, speaks into

intercom)

Get me some reporters.

(afterthought)

Particularly Louella Parsons!

CUT TO:

YOUNG MAN

Miss Farmer... I've never done this

before... but... I had to tell ya'

you're great!

FRANCES

Thank you very much. I'm glad you

liked the play.

YOUNG MAN

I'm really sad it's closing. Now

what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?

FRANCES

You can always come see it in London.

YOUNG MAN

Only if you were in it. Are you?

FRANCES

I wouldn't miss it.

YOUNG MAN

Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to

Hollywood.

FRANCES

(smiling)

Are you an actor?

YOUNG MAN

Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still

in school. But as soon as I

graduate... California, here I come!

FRANCES

(after a pause)

Are you really serious? About acting?

YOUNG MAN

Why... yes.

FRANCES

Then don't go to Hollywood.

YOUNG MAN

Why?

FRANCES

I'm telling you straight, if you

have any serious ambitions, stay

clear of the place. It'll crush you.

YOUNG MAN

You sound as if you hate it.

FRANCES

No, I don't hate it.

YOUNG MAN

Aren't you ever going back?

FRANCES

...Not if I can help it.

YOUNG MAN

Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.

FRANCES

They'll mend.

YOUNG MAN

(after a pause)

What about your husband?

FRANCES

What?

YOUNG MAN

Will you be getting back together?

When you quit Hollywood, I mean.

FRANCES

What is this?

YOUNG MAN

Is it true you're getting a divorce?

Comrade?

FRANCES

Why, you... you little bastard!

YOUNG MAN

Thanks for our chat, Miss Farmer. Be

seeing you.

FRANCES

Just one minute...

YOUNG MAN

(turning)

You're wasting your time, lady.

Nothing's off the record with me.

ODETS

How'd it go?

FRANCES

'But how do I know you love me?'

ODETS

Your big speech?

FRANCES

'How do I know it's true? You'll get

to be the champ. They'll all want

you, all the girls! But I don't care.

I've been undersea a long time. When

they'd put their hands on me I used

to say, "This isn't it! This isn't

what I mean!" It's been a mysterious

world for me! But Joe, I think you're

it! I don't know why, I think you're

it. Take me home with you.'

ODETS

(smiling)

I already have.

FRANCES

How's it sound?

ODETS

The speech? Real good.

FRANCES

You think I got it?

ODETS

You got it.

FRANCES

Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got

it.

FRANCES

Hello, Harold.

CLURMAN

(nodding)

Frances.

FRANCES

(looking around)

Where's Clifford?

CLURMAN

He's not here.

FRANCES

Oh.

CLURMAN

Bourbon?

FRANCES

What's up?

CLURMAN

I hear you're meeting with the studio

lawyers to get out of your contract.

FRANCES

That's right. I don't want them

breathing down my neck while we're

in London.

CLURMAN

Well... well, you see, that's the

point. You won't be opening in London.

FRANCES

(insecure)

You don't think I'm good enough?

CLURMAN

What?! Good Lord no, it's just...

It's money. We needed backing and...

well, we found it.

FRANCES

Who?

CLURMAN

An actress.

FRANCES

A rich actress.

CLURMAN

Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.

FRANCES

(growing angry)

But... but wait a minute. We're

supposed to be different, right?

Clifford says... This theatre is

supposed to be different! And this

play... this play is all about what

greed and money do to people!

CLURMAN

I know, but --

FRANCES

(over his line)

What does Clifford say?

CLURMAN

Right now we have to be practical.

FRANCES

Does Clifford even know?

(off his silence)

You didn't tell him, did you?

(standing)

I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?

CLURMAN

He knows, Frances.

CLURMAN

(gently)

He approved it.

CLURMAN

I'm very sorry, but... well, Hollywood

wants you back, right?

FRANCES

Prick!

HARRY

Of course it can be done, "Mr. Jones,"

but it's how you do it. There's a

way to pay off L.A. cops and a way

to get yourself arrested. First you

gotta know who to approach --

MAN AT PHONE

You Harry York?

FRANCES

Harry? Harry, where are you?!

HARRY (V.O.)

Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?

FRANCES

I called your god-damned office! I

want you to kill him, Harry. You'll

do that for me, won't you? I loved

him, I loved him... that bastard.

HARRY

Calm down, Frances.

FRANCES (V.O.)

Don't tell me what to do, just give

me his head on a platter!

FRANCES

Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My

wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I

can't see you any more.' Just like

that!

HARRY (V.O.)

Frances...

FRANCES

(sobbing)

Harry, I hate being in love. I don't

ever want to be in love again. I

just hate it!

HARRY

I know, Frances... I know.

FADE OUT:

A.D.

How was that?

DIRECTOR

(looking up)

Good, good. One more time.

FRANCES

(standing)

For God's sake... why?

DIRECTOR

Because we want to get it perfect...

just the right combination of fury

and confusion. You can understand

that, can't you, Miss Farmer? We're

serious artists here, right? Right.

FRANCES

Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to

my contract, but you can't break me.

I'm back, and I'm gonna make the

best of it.

BEBE

(somewhat snidely)

I'd like nothing better.

BARNES

Well... come on.

FRANCES

This is a mistake. No. This is a

disaster.

BARNES

Come on, it's just what you need!

Let everyone see you. Talk to them,

live it up!

FRANCES

(tiredly)

But we've been at it since six this

morning. At least you could've let

me go home and change.

BARNES

Look, Frances, I didn't want this

job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged

me: improve your image. So please...

lemme try, huh?

FRANCES

(getting out)

You're right. I'm sorry.

(sighs)

Okay, let's go get 'em.

BARNES

(taking pills from

pocket)

Here, take a few of these. Studio

makes 'em in the basement. They keep

the fat off.

FRANCES

(joking)

So not only am I a troublesome bitch,

but I'm fat too?

BARNES

Come on. They make you feel nice and

peppy.

BARNES

Hi! Bob Barnes! Looks like a swell

party!

CONNIE

(pleased)

Frances!

FRANCES

(whisper)

God, who's here?

CONNIE

(also whispering)

The usual vermin, I'm afraid.

FRANCES

(sotto voice)

Get me a drink.

FRANCES

Hi everybody.

SNIDE VOICE

So nice to have you back, Frances.

FRANCES

Connie, can I use the upstairs

bathroom?

CONNIE

Sure.

FRANCES

Come in.

FRANCES

(relaxed)

Hi.

BARNES

You wouldn't believe the offers!

Just piling in. I mean piling. Some

of the best scripts I've read in

years!

YOUNG REPORTER

(sarcastic)

Yes? My employer will be glad to

hear that.

BARNES

Louella? Is she here?

YOUNG REPORTER

How could you miss her?

BARNES

Louella's here and I'm talking to

you?

BARNES

Frances?

(enters, sees her)

Oh no.

FRANCES

Refill my drink, will you, Bob?

BARNES

(aghast)

What're you doing?

FRANCES

Putting on my armor.

BARNES

Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is

here. She wants to talk to you, help

you out.

FRANCES

(musing)

Louella... didn't she call me a

spoiled little bitch?

BARNES

Come on, she's an important columnist!

What's the matter? I thought you

wanted these people to forgive you.

FRANCES

(darkly)

'Forgive'...? For What?

BARNES

I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate

choice of words.

FRANCES

You're not kidding.

(firmly)

Get me a refill, Bob. I'll be down

in a minute.

FRANCES

Thank you.

YOUNG REPORTER

(his callow youth act)

Gee, awful good to see ya again,

Miss Farmer.

YOUNG REPORTER

My employer would like to know

something very important: is it true

your friend Clifford sleeps in the

nude?

FRANCES

You seem like an intelligent young

man.

YOUNG REPORTER

Huh?

FRANCES

Can't you find a more dignified way

to make a living?

COP

Okay...

COP

(a come-on)

Hey, where's the fire, sister?

FRANCES

(sarcastic)

In my eyes, officer.

COP

Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see

the sign says "Dimout Zone?"

(switching off her

lights)

There's a war on, you know?

FRANCES

Come on. You're seriously trying to

tell me the Japs can't find Los

Angeles without my headlights?

COP

(testy)

I didn't make the law, lady. I just

enforce it.

FRANCES

God, you bore me.

FRANCES

Don't touch me!

COP

Hey!

COP

(panting)

Santa Monica, this is motor six-sixty-

six. I got a live one here.

FADE OUT:

HARRY (O.S.)

Got any ginger beer?

FRANCES

Take a look.

FRANCES

(calling)

How the hell do you find me anyway?

HARRY (O.S.)

Animal magnetism!

(she laughs)

No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?

FRANCES

What's left of my blood.

HARRY (O.S.)

Think I'll have a glass.

FRANCES

Help yourself. Everyone else has.

HARRY

Very tasty.

HARRY

(looking around)

Nice joint. Can you afford it?

FRANCES

Nope. The studio pays. Thank you,

Harry.

HARRY

What for?

FRANCES

For not chopping off his head and

serving it to me on a platter.

HARRY

Well, I would have, you know? I just

didn't know how to cook it.

HARRY

Six months' probation...? You gotta

learn when to do battle, Farmer.

You're not going to win many bouts

with 200 pound cops.

FRANCES

I took the early rounds.

HARRY

(laughs)

I'll bet.

FRANCES

I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some

things, no matter what you do with

them, they just hurt.

HARRY

So you drink, and you fight with a

cop...?

FRANCES

Yeah, and you look at people and you

wonder who the hell they are, what's

going on inside their heads. Sometimes

you can hear it, like a buzzing, the

things that happen in their heads.

And you wonder: does anybody ever

love anybody, really?

HARRY

Beats me.

FRANCES

I gotta get outta here. I gotta get

out of this town.

HARRY

Hey look, I got some business down

in San Diego. Whattaya say you come

with me, stay a few days?

FRANCES

No, Harry, I can't --

(right now)

HARRY

You're coming.

FRANCES

You know... when I started acting,

you know what I wanted?

FRANCES

I just wanted to be part of

something... one thing, one play or

one movie, something that was really

fine... memorable. And I could say:

I did that, I made something good.

HARRY

And?

FRANCES

Well... to get a crack at something

good, you gotta earn it, you gotta

climb the ladder first. So you do,

you work hard, and all these people

behind you are pushing you up,

shouting you on. And then one day

you realize you are, you're at the

top... and there's nothing there.

And you look behind you and there's

no one below. You're just left there

all alone... swaying in the god-damned

breeze.

HARRY

Well, like the man said: "You can

make a fresh start with your last

breath."

FRANCES

(irritated)

Hey, watch it.

SAILOR

(eyeing her

suggestively)

Watch what?

FRANCES

Get away from me, you foul slime.

SAILOR

That's no way for a lady to talk.

HARRY

Take a walk, pal.

FRANCES

Who said I was a lady?

SAILOR

Sorry I insulted you... bitch.

HARRY

Hey!

FRANCES

Ahhh, go eat a toilet seat.

DISSOLVE TO:

FRANCES

What happened? Who're you?

MAN

Who're you?

FRANCES

I live here.

MAN

You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look,

they took your stuff out. Moved it

to some hotel, I think.

FRANCES

What?

MAN

I'm preparin' it for the next tenant,

he's coming in tomorrow.

SMASH CUT TO:

FRANCES

(muttering)

God damn it, god damn it...

(into phone)

Yes, I'll wait, I'm waiting...

(to herself)

I don't believe this. They can't do

this to me!

FRANCES

(into phone)

Barnes? It's my diary! They stole my

fucking diary! Find it, will you?

Find it! God damn it, that's my life!

DIRECTOR

Never. Never again. I swear, I swear

I will never work with this broad --

DIRECTOR

You're four hours late! It's insane!

It's unprofessional!

FRANCES

I'd say I'm behaving as professionally

as anyone else in this town.

DIRECTOR

Where were you?!

FRANCES

Terribly, terribly sorry; I overslept.

What's the name of this fine

entertainment we're all so involved

in?

FRANCES

(looking blearly at

the slate)

Oh yes. "No Escape." That's it.

There's no escape.

TORA

It's about time! You're not the star

on this show, y'know!

TORA

Of course, it's not up to me to say

anything. I'm just crew... Y'know,

you hair's so fine you'll lose it if

you're not careful. Wonder you all

don't, the things you do to

yourselves. In fact, I think you are

already... Fact, I think you better --

FRANCES

That's it! I'm not taking this any

more! I quit!

FRANCES

Goodbye!... goodbye!... goodbye!...

FRANCES

Shit.

FRANCES

What the hell's going on here?

(calls)

Hold on!

(answering phone)

Hello...

(we HEAR a dial tone)

Hello?

FRANCES

Hey!

FRANCES

What...? Help!

FRANCES

Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

FRANCES

Mama, help me, help me, Mama! Don't

let them kill me!

COP

Get your clothes on.

FRANCES

(crying)

You have no right! You have no fucking

right, you bastards! Get the hell

out of here --

COP

Get your clothes on, lady --

FRANCES

GET OUT!

COP

You're under arrest.

SERGEANT

Name?

FRANCES

I don't believe this! You jerks drag

me down here in the middle of the

night and you don't even know who

the hell I am!

SERGEANT

Age?

FRANCES

Fifteen.

SERGEANT

(bristling)

Address?

FRANCES

Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant

vagabond. Come on, this is a joke!

Assault and battery? I barely touched

that bitch!

SERGEANT

Occupation?

FRANCES

Cocksucker.

FRANCES

Hey! I'd like to leave a wake-up

call for say, ten? Hey! I'll have my

bread and water in bed!

PHOTOGRAPHER

Hey Frances! Why don't you comb your

hair, okay?

FRANCES

...Take me the way I am.

JUDGE

...Is that not true?

FRANCES

(under her breath)

Who's writing this guy's lines?

JUDGE

Answer the question! Have you driven

a car since you were placed on

probation?

FRANCES

No, I couldn't get my hands on one.

JUDGE

Have you reported to your Probation

Officer as directed?

FRANCES

I never saw him. Why didn't he show

up?

JUDGE

Did you expect him to look you up?

FRANCES

Why, certainly. I wanted to get a

peek at his face...

JUDGE

You're on your way to a contempt

citation, young lady.

FRANCES

That's fine with me...

(turning to spectators)

Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon,

c'mon, what is this, an audience or

a jury?

JUDGE

Miss Farmer, is it true you fought

with the policeman who arrested you

last night?

FRANCES

Sure it's true. I was fighting for

my country as well as myself.

JUDGE

Miss Farmer, you were advised at the

last hearing that if you took one

drink of liquor or failed to be a

law-abiding citizen --

FRANCES

Are you telling me you didn't have a

little rum in your pineapple juice

this morning? I can smell it from

here, Your Honor.

JUDGE

That's enough!

FRANCES

It's the truth! I can smell it from

here -- you old hypocrite!

JUDGE

Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant

disregard for the conditions of your

probation, coupled with the

unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff

here... I am forced to order you to

begin serving a sentence of 180 days

in the County Jail.

FRANCES

Fine!

JUDGE

(rising)

You are a deeply troubled young

lady... I only hope you change your

course before it's too late.

FRANCES

(frightened now)

Wait a minute... I haven't got a

lawyer...

FRANCES

(shouting)

What I want to know is do I have any

civil rights?

FRANCES

I want to make a phone call...

FRANCES

I have a right to make a phone call!

REPORTER

(from his notes)

"The kleig-lighted road to fame and

fortune is strewn with heartbreak

and despair. Today film star Frances

Farmer, tarnished by alcohol and

drugs" -- 'm I going too fast for

ya?

FRANCES

They're stealing my civil rights!

Help me! I'm being kidnapped! Oh

God, help me! Help me!

FRANCES

(to a Matron)

Haven't you ever had a broken heart?

REPORTER

Oh my God, she's loose!

REPORTER

She's attacking your correspondent!

Right here in the Court Building!

Good God, this bitch is crazy! Someone

stop her!

FRANCES

(a whisper)

Harry!

FRANCES

I have a right! I have a right!

REPORTER

(into phone)

With what must surely be the final

act of madness, the curtain falls on

Frances Farmer's once promising

career. The crazed blonde who at

27...

REPORTER

Hold it a second, Bub...

WOMAN

...and we feel that this would be

more appropriate.

JUDGE

...a difficult decision, but, I'm

sure, the proper one.

FRANCES

What?

LILLIAN

(whispering)

It's alright now, little sister,

everything's going to be just fine.

FRANCES

Mama, what's...

LILLIAN

Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail,

Frances. The Judge has put you under

my care. I'll see you get the rest

you need.

FRANCES

You're taking me home!

LILLIAN

(smiling)

First things first, little sister.

Trust me.

LILLIAN

Why it's beautiful here! What a view!

MAN

Good afternoon, Miss Farmer. I'm Dr.

Symington.

LILLIAN

Good afternoon, Doctor.

SYMINGTON

I'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs.

Farmer. I'm sure we'll have more of

a chance to talk later. Right now I

think it's important that your

daughter have a chance to settle in.

Perhaps it would be best if you said

your goodbyes here.

LILLIAN

Oh. Well, I have some background

that you should probably know about

if you're...

SYMINGTON

I have no doubt, Mrs. Farmer. If

you'll speak to the girl at the desk,

she'll arrange an appointment.

LILLIAN

I'll be back real soon, little sister.

You be a good girl.

FRANCES

(staring out window)

Mama!

FRANCES

(warningly)

...I want to go home, Mama.

LILLIAN

You'll see, little sister. Everything

will be fine. The doctors know best.

SYMINGTON

I find these initial meetings to be

much easier without the concerned

relatives in attendance.

FRANCES

Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?

SYMINGTON

Thanks are hardly necessary.

FRANCES

Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.

SYMINGTON

I'm glad to see you haven't lost

your sense of humor.

FRANCES

It ain't for lack of trying.

SYMINGTON

So it seems. May we be serious for a

moment?

FRANCES

(seductively)

Why, Doctor! We've only just met!

SYMINGTON

I feel I've known you for a long

time... you see, I've followed your

career... you're a fascinating case...

I'm looking forward to resolving

your predicament.

FRANCES

Oh! Are you really?

SYMINGTON

Among persons such as yourself,

creative people under great stress,

erratic behavior is not at all

uncommon and certainly nothing to be

ashamed of. It's just that the

neuroses which fuel your talent can

also generate certain character

disabilities which...

(can cripple your

ability to function...)

FRANCES

Do you expect me, for one moment, to

believe you have greater insight

into my personality than I do?

SYMINGTON

Please sit down...

FRANCES

You may discuss my predicament,

Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone

you like, but not with me. I'm not

interested. I can solve my problems

without recourse to a veternarian.

SYMINGTON

I see.

FRANCES

Besides, I don't want to be what you

want to make me.

SYMINGTON

And what's that?

FRANCES

Normal. Average.

SYMINGTON

All right. Will you please sit down

now?

(smiling)

Symington says.

FRANCES

...Did you really say that?

SYMINGTON

Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.

FRANCES

This whole thing is a joke!

SYMINGTON

Stay calm, please.

FRANCES

No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're

finding that difficult, aren't you?

(soft, seductive)

Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps

later, in some of our more intimate

sessions... after we know each other

a little better...

(turning harder)

and you've torn my personality to

shreds, and I'm weeping and

vulnerable...

(very hard)

then you'll really get your kicks,

won't you, "Doctor?"

SYMINGTON

I'll have someone show you to your

room.

FRANCES

Oh, that's good, very professional.

In control. But the tiny beads of

sweat on your upper lip give you

away.

SYMINGTON

You really should get some rest now.

Nurse will meet you outside. Good

day.

SYMINGTON

Is there something else?

FRANCES

You didn't say 'Symington says'.

SYMINGTON

Symington says.

LILLIAN

Not much on hospital corners, are

you?

MATRON

You Farmer?

FRANCES

So this is the nuthouse...

NURSE

Honey... take my word for it. This

is a resort.

LILLIAN (O.S.)

You have no right!

LILLIAN

Tell them who I am! Tell them who I

am!

FRANCES

Are you crazy? Unhand that woman!

That's Amelia Earhart!

FRANCES (O.S.)

But what is it?

FRANCES

You've got to tell me what it is!

THIN NURSE

It's insulin. It throws your body

into shock.

NURSE WITH HYPO

(reassuringly)

It's just vitamins.

NURSE WITH HYPO

A, C, B-Complex, certain minerals...

(inserting hypo)

Just stay relaxed... Good, now open

your mouth a sec.

LILLIAN

...and here's the one from Duluth. A

war widow with five children. She

works in a defense plant and she's

very worried about you. I answered

her that she shouldn't let worry

over you affect her vital work; and

that you'd be back on the silver

screen in no time.

LILLIAN

And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss.

He says that...

FRANCES

Why are these all opened?

LILLIAN

Well, they needed immediate answers,

Frances. It's good manners and good

sense. You shouldn't be bothering

yourself with these right now.

FRANCES

Then why did you bring them?

LILLIAN

It's your fan mail, little sister.

FRANCES

(looking off, under

her breath)

You kill me, Mama.

LILLIAN

What?

FRANCES

Go on...

SYMINGTON

...I'm sorry to keep you waiting,

the staff review ran over. Did you

enjoy your mother's visit?

FRANCES

(sitting)

Yes. It was very good to see her.

SYMINGTON

Really? Any problems?

FRANCES

Not at all. She brought me my fan

mail.

(a performance)

I had no idea there were so many

strangers concerned about me. But I

guess that's the best thing about

working in the movies. You make so

many friends. I want to go back and

show them that the faith they put in

me wasn't a mistake.

SYMINGTON

You're telling me you feel guilty.

FRANCES

(slightly edgy)

No... What I mean is... I'm just

very excited by the prospect of

getting on with my life, that's all.

SYMINGTON

(after a pause)

Do you really believe your mother's

trying to kill you?

FRANCES

(laughing)

What?

SYMINGTON

She told me you said, "Mama, you

want to kill me."

FRANCES

I never said... Oh look. That's just

a figure of speech. She said something

funny, and I said...

SYMINGTON

And you accused her of tampering

with your mail.

FRANCES

Oh for Christ's...

FRANCES

I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's

all.

SYMINGTON

But you tell me you had a pleasant

visit and your mother says you were

sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do

you think I should believe?

FRANCES

Doctor, I hate to break this to you,

but my mother is a little batty.

SYMINGTON

Frances, you're still filled with

anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile

toward your family and friends.

Consequently, I didn't recommend

your release at the staff review.

FRANCES

You what?

SYMINGTON

Mental illness is an elusive thing,

and though I'm pleased you're feeling

more... capable, it's perhaps

unrealistic to expect you to be

completely cured after so short a

time. Don't you agree?

SYMINGTON

(smiling)

I'm sure you'll see it my way in the

end.

FRANCES

Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?

SYMINGTON

Huh?

FRANCES

'Cause if it's long enough, which I

doubt, why don't you wrap it around

and fuck yourself in the ass!

FRANCES

I want outta here, you understand?

I'm ready to get out! So you go back

there... you go back and you tell

them to let me out!

SYMINGTON

(calmly)

Frances, I'm warning you...

FRANCES

No, I'm warning you! Who do you think

you are, God? You bumble around with

your folders...

(she knocks her folder

to the floor)

...and your pencils...

(she grabs some pencils

and throws them at

him)

...and your god-damn buttons...

(she pounds on the

inter-com; a voice

says, 'Yes, Doctor?')

...all your badges of authority! But

you have no authority! You're nothing!

You're a zero!

ORDERLY

Doc?

FRANCES

Symington says...

SYMINGTON

(tonelessly)

Sedate her.

HARRY (O.S.)

Hi there. How 'bout a walk in the

woods?

FRANCES

Oh my God, I look awful.

HARRY

(friendly)

You've looked a whole lot better.

C'mon.

FRANCES

They're doin' stuff to me, Harry.

Can you see it? You feel it? They're

putting stuff in my food or something,

my water, and they're using it to

put thoughts in my head. You

understand? They're trying to re-

arrange what's in my head, they're

trying to drive me crazy! Oh, Harry!

FRANCES

I can't stay here anymore, you

understand? I can't, I can't. I gotta

get home. I gotta get somewhere else,

anywhere, okay?

ATTENDANT

Oh, Miss Farmer! Time for your bath,

Miss Farmer!

HARRY

(urgent whisper)

Listen: to the left. Straight through

the trees and over the wall to your

left. My car is there.

ATTENDANT

(as if to a child)

It's time for your bath!

FRANCES

Oh good. I love my baths.

ATTENDANT

Come along now.

HARRY

Frances! Did you hear what I said?

FRANCES

Of course, Harry.

FRANCES

(fiercely)

Over the walls!

HARRY

You want crazy? I'll show you crazy!

HARRY

(offering to lift her)

Here.

HARRY

Evening, gorgeous.

FRANCES

(yawning)

That sure looks like fun...

(leaning over front

seat)

You know how long it's been since I

was behind the wheel?

HARRY

Forget it, Frances. You're not

driving.

FRANCES

Have I told you how mean you're

turning, York?

FRANCES

Where are we, mean man?

HARRY

Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut

across to Montana. I've got friends

there with a ranch.

FRANCES

I should've known...

HARRY

What?

FRANCES

This is another one of your schemes

to get me off alone...

HARRY

That's right.

FRANCES

(smiling)

...Take advantage of me.

FRANCES

I don't think I'd be much good in a

war...

HARRY

Whattaya think you're in now?

FRANCES

(sleepily)

I don't know. Not a war exactly.

It's more a... a misapprehension

maybe...

HARRY

Huh?

FRANCES

A misunderstanding, people taking

the wrong meaning from things. I

wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was

just saying my prayers.

HARRY

Who to?

FRANCES

Harry, I have to go home. I have to

talk to Mama.

HARRY

Frances, you're fulla drugs. You

don't know what you're saying. Who

do you think put you into Meadow

Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy

and she'll keep on thinking it as

long as it suits her.

FRANCES

(sitting up)

No, she just didn't want me going to

jail, that's all.

HARRY

Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm

not taking you there, and that's

that!

FRANCES

You know something, Harry?

HARRY

I guess.

FRANCES

Aside from meanness, you're almost

perfect. There's only one other thing

wrong with you.

HARRY

What's that?

FRANCES

You can't drink.

SMASH CUT TO:

FRANCES

(wincing/grinning)

Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!

HARRY

(calling drunkenly)

Hey! Another shot for the lady and a

double for me!

FRANCES

What a man!

HARRY

Hey, you're a good quarter-horse,

kid, but you can't go a route of

ground.

FRANCES

(hoisting her glass)

To quarter-horses.

HARRY

No. To thoroughbreds.

BING'S VOICE

Love is so terrific Such a funny

feeling Makes you want to cuddle And

coo...

BING & HARRY

Makes you sentimental, Makes you

kinda gentle Ouch!

(Frances pinches Harry)

Terrific thing.

FRANCES

Why are you always leaving me, Harry?

HARRY

Huh?

FRANCES

You should stickaround sometimes.

Look out for me.

HARRY

Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask

this one time. I mean it. I swear

after this, I'll never ask again:

Will you marry me?

FRANCES

(after a long pause)

I know a thing or two about marriage.

You... you understand me more than

anyone, Harry... maybe even more

than Mama. But... you're too important

to me. I'd fail you. I don't know

how or why, but I would. And that's

a chance I just can't take. Do you

understand?

HARRY

(a bitter smile)

Well... I'll act like I do until I

do.

HARRY

There's just one more thing.

FRANCES

What's that?

HARRY

Will you marry me?

HARRY

It's not too late to keep going, up

to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.

FRANCES

Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't

explain it. She's my mother. She's

just... I can't give up on her that

easy.

HARRY

You give up on her?

FRANCES

Yeah. It's just... something I gotta

do, I guess.

HARRY

(smiling warmly)

Frances, You're crazy.

FRANCES

(whispers)

I know. Don't tell anyone.

HARRY

Anyway... if you need me...

FRANCES

(warmly)

I got your number, Mister Man.

LILLIAN

(nervous, forced)

Welcome home, little sister.

FRANCES

Well, who have we here...?

LILLIAN

(anxiously)

Frances, you remember my lawyer,

Alma Styles?

STYLES

Hello, Frances. You seem to be having

quite a time of it.

LILLIAN

I called Alma because I think we'll

need...

STYLES

Frances, the doctors at Meadow Wood

have petitioned the court for your

return. Your mother has asked me to

intervene so you can stay here.

LILLIAN

I swear I didn't know what they were

doing to you. I wouldn't have let

them...

FRANCES

It's okay, Mama. It's okay.

STYLES

You realize, of course, your mother

is now your legal guardian. In the

eyes of the law, you no longer have

any rights as an adult. You're going

to have to hold your tongue and be

selective about whom you mix with.

That man who drove you here, for

instance --

FRANCES

You leave him out of this!

LILLIAN

Frances, please don't...

STYLES

Never mind. We won't have to worry

about him much longer.

FBI MAN

(smiling)

How ya doin', Al?

HARRY

You got the wrong guy. Name's Slocum.

FBI MAN

No, it ain't. And it ain't Harry

York, neither.

HARRY

Look, I'm tellin' you...

FBI MAN

I'd give you till ten, Al, but we

ain't got the time.

SMASH CUT TO:

HILLIER

Alvin Hanson, a.k.a. Ronald Burns,

Thomas Slocum, Harry York... Mr.

Hanson, this warrant has been

outstanding for many years. Normally

that circumstance would prompt me

toward leniency, but the crime you

committed -- inciting to riot -- and

the cause you sought to promote -- a

worker's rebellion -- are such

anathemas to this court that I feel

compelled to mete out the full

sentence. I only wish it were longer.

(slamming gavel)

Six months in the state penitentiary.

LILLIAN

Frances, play 'Flow Gently Sweet

Afton'.

FRANCES

Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that

song.

LILLIAN

Please. I want you to. It would make

me so happy.

LILLIAN

It's just a flow gently sweet Afton

day. Life has been so good to me.

Why, I have just about everything

one could wish... but I still have

so many blank pages in my scrapbook.

FRANCES

I think I need a little air.

LILLIAN

What's wrong?

FRANCES

Nothing. I think I'll just go out

for awhile.

LILLIAN

Where are you going?

FRANCES

For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.

LILLIAN

How long will you be?

FRANCES

Not long.

LILLIAN

(smiling)

I'll have lunch ready by one.

FRANCES

I'll be back.

LILLIAN

At one. Promise?

FRANCES

Sure.

LILLIAN

Say you promise.

FRANCES

I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.

LILLIAN

You know, the surest way to lose an

appetite, is to drink, little sister.

FRANCES

(exiting)

Yes, Mama.

LILLIAN

I don't want you drinking, Frances.

FRANCES

Yes, Mama.

FRANCES

...So what do you think?

ERNEST

I don't know, honey. Your mother has

such big plans for you.

FRANCES

I know that, Dad, but --

ERNEST

What you have to understand, Francie,

is that she... well... she wanted so

much for herself too, and for me,

and she never really got to... The

only time I ever saw her happy was

if her name was in the papers... but

she could have been... if times were

different she could have been a

politician or... I don't know.

FRANCES

But Dad, I'm asking about me. What

do you think I should do?

ERNEST

(after a pause)

Well, Francie, sometimes after you

get your hands on something you want,

it just doesn't look the same. Then

you have to be real smart to know if

you should hold onto it because it's

all you've got... or just let it go.

This is the way of things, but I

guess you already know that.

FRANCES

Dad... whatever I decide, will it be

okay with you?

ERNEST

Always. Always.

ERNEST

I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk

in my room, and...

(it's not a proper

office)

FRANCES

I don't care, Dad. I love you.

ERNEST

I love you too, Francie.

FRANCES (O.S.)

I'm back, Mama.

LILLIAN

(coming into hall)

Oh Frances, do I have news for you!

Guess who --

FRANCES

(excited)

Wait, Mama, wait. I have something

to tell you. I've decided... well...

I'm not going to make movies anymore.

I thought that's what I wanted, and

I went after it with all my soul,

the way you taught me, but I was

miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed

me. So now... now it's over. I want

a different kind of life, something...

simple. I want to live someplace

quiet and peaceful... in the country

maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats --

I feel so light suddenly, so clear

for the first time in... It's going

to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I

love you.

LILLIAN

(coming down stairs)

Don't... talk crazy.

FRANCES

Mama...?

LILLIAN

(entering living room)

They want you back! Your agent called

today! Don't you understand? He's

sending the scripts. He wants to fly

up here in a week with the publicity

people! Frances, you can't do this

to your fans! Why, they've been

praying for you all through this

nightmare. You can't turn your back

on them now! Look at this fan mail

I've been answering!

FRANCES

Haven't you heard what I said?

LILLIAN

I told him to come up! I told him

you wanted to show them all that

there's nothing wrong with you any

more, that you're completely cured!

FRANCES

I'm not cured. I was never sick!

They had no business putting me in

there! My only responsibility is to

myself now!

LILLIAN

You... you selfish, selfish child.

At least talk to him, hear what he

has to say.

FRANCES

No!

LILLIAN

You want to throw it all away, is

that it? You had everything, little

sister. Beauty... a brilliant

career... a wonderful husband. You

were a movie star!

FRANCES

Mama, shut up!

LILLIAN

And now you're throwing everything

away? You're gonna be a nobody!

Nobody! You know what that's like?!

FRANCES

(sudden realization)

You... You'd send me back, wouldn't

you? You would.

LILLIAN

Where are you going?

FRANCES

I'm going out!

LILLIAN

You're not going anywhere!

FRANCES

Yes, I am, and you can't stop me!

You can't tell me what to do, mother.

I'm a grown woman, and I can decide

about my own life.

LILLIAN

Frances!

FRANCES

Don't you try and stop me. Don't you

dare!

FRANCES

If you follow me, Mama, I swear I'll

fucking kill you!

LILLIAN

That's it. You've done it now, little

sister.

LILLIAN

All my life, I've tried to live up

to my parents' example. To have the

independence of mind and fortitude

of spirit that have made this country

great. I taught that to Frances:

Speak out. Aspire. Make something of

yourself, something --

(to be proud of)

DR. DOYLE

(bored)

Yes, yes, Mrs. Farmer --

ALMA STYLES

Frances has always been a

battleground, Lillian.

DOYLE

The point is: it's your opinion that

Frances is getting steadily worse?

LILLIAN

Well... yes.

DOYLE

And you feel you're unable to control

her any longer?

LILLIAN

No... I mean, yes, Doctor.

DOYLE

And the only course open to you is

to commit your daughter for a period

of time to a mental institution?

LILLIAN

Well, Alma told me that...

LILLIAN

...Yes.

DOYLE

(closing his folder)

I believe that's all I need to know

about Miss Farmer.

HILLIER

I think in all future documents she

should be referred to as Mrs. R. H.

Richardson.

LILLIAN

Her married name?

HILLIER

Yes. It's less recognizable. I'm

sure you'd prefer to keep unpleasant

publicity to a minimum.

LILLIAN

...Oh yes.

HILLIER

Now. Can you tell us where we might

find Frances?

FRANCES

...Looking for a drink, and the town

is deserted, he can't understand it.

Finally he finds a bar, goes in --

the place is empty, bartender's

closing up. Salesman says, 'Gimme a

martini.' Bartender's real nervous,

he says, 'No, no, no, I gotta close.

Big Otis is coming to town.'

FRANCES

Salesman says, 'I don't care. I gotta

have a martini.' So the bartender

fixes him a martini real fast, grabs

his money, and runs out the back.

Salesman sits there sipping his

martini,... he's got the bar all to

himself... Then he hears it. This

big roaring in the street.

RRRAAAAAAA!!!

(stomping her feet)

Gigantic footsteps... coming closer.

Stopping.

FRANCES

Enormous hands reach in, grab the

swinging doors and rip them off their

hinges. This huge man stomps in.

Picks up a chair and hurls it over

the bar, smashing the mirror --

whiskey and glass flying everywhere.

FRANCES

He turns to the salesman: 'What the

hell're you doing in here!' Salesman

says, 'I'm just drinking a martini.'

'Oh yeah?' the guy says. 'Well you

better get outa here! Big Otis is

coming to town!'

DOYLE

...From her history, it's apparent

the patient suffers from a paranoid

reaction with pronounced egotism.

Her violent responses have recently

included aggression against her

mother. In view of the deep-seated

nature of her ailments and her failure

to respond satisfactorily to insulin

shock, it is my opinion she may

ultimately require permanent

institutional care.

HILLIER

(to Styles)

Counsellor, as Guardian ad litem for

Mrs. Richardson, do you waive jury

trial?

STYLES

Yes, your Honor.

HILLIER

Having heard the testimony of a

legally qualified and reputable

physician... and being further

satisfied of the truth of all matters

set forth in the certificates of

said physician, I do hereby order

that the said Mrs. R. H. Richardson,

an insane person, be confined to the

Western State Hospital for the Insane

at Steilacoom.

HILLIER

So ordered! Are the gentlemen from

Steilacoom present?

DOCTOR #1

What's she getting, anyway?

DOCTOR #2

Standard series to start.

DOCTOR #1

Fifteen?

STUDENT

Can I push the button on this one?

DOCTOR #2

Sure.

DISSOLVE TO:

FRANCES

(speaking with

difficulty)

Doctor, it may sound odd, but I

believe I've profited from my stay

here. It's just what I've needed, to

get away like this. But I'm

recuperated now. I've had lots of

time to think and I've made a few

decisions about my life. I'm ready

to get on with it.

DOYLE

I know you believe that.

FRANCES

...Don't you?

DOYLE

I'm afraid not. You see, we observe

things that you're unaware of: signs,

indicators. Your problem cuts very

deep, Frances, and we have to get at

that deeper stuff so that when you

do get out, you'll really feel secure.

Does that make sense?

FRANCES

No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I

know better.

DOYLE

(smiling)

Listen to yourself, Frances. The

resistance, the anger in your voice.

FRANCES

(tightly)

You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor,

tell me honestly, what do I have to

do to get out of here?

DOYLE

Be patient, that's all. Take an

interest in your treatment and don't

dwell on your resentments. You'll be

yourself again, I assure you.

FRANCES

...I see.

DOYLE

We'll talk more about this. I'll see

you later.

FRANCES

One question. If I'm not myself now,

just who do you think I am?

DOYLE

We'll talk.

FRANCES

What the hell!

CHANT

Come and get it! Come and get it!

Come and get it!

CHANT

We want Frances! We want Frances!

FRANCES

Come and get it...

HARRY

(whispering)

Frances! Frances!

FRANCES

Who?

HARRY

Frances, it's me, Harry?

FRANCES

...Touch me again and I'll kill you,

you pig.

DOCTOR

Watch out, Harry. Let me look her

over.

HARRY

Oh, God! Let's get her out of here

tonight, right now! Let's take her

with us!

DOCTOR

The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets

out legally, they can't come after

her.

HARRY

Look at her! She'll never pass that

sanity test tomorrow...

DOCTOR

I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just

hold her.

(pulling a hypodermic

from his pocket)

Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll

clear her head. She'll wake up feeling

smart and sailright through the

hearing.

DOCTOR

Yeah... she knows about these. Shut

her up.

HARRY

(tenderly)

You'll be okay, honey. He's just

givin' you something to make you

think, so that tomorrow you can tell

'em what they want to hear, okay?

Tell 'em you were crazy as a loon

and they cured you and you're

grateful.

DOCTOR

This stuff takes pretty quick. Let's

go.

FRANCES

(grabbing Harry)

Please! Take me!

DOCTOR

(pulling Harry)

Let's get out of here! I'll lose my

job!

HARRY

Frances, we gotta do it this way.

Just remember tomorrow, remember

what I told you. What're you gonna

tell 'em?

FRANCES

(groggily)

I'm grateful... grateful.

WOMEN IN WARD

I'm grateful! I'm grateful!

DOCTOR

(very worried)

Harry!

HARRY

I gotta go now.

FRANCES

Harry, please!

DOCTOR

We're all square now, Harry. Right?

HARRY

All square, Doc.

DOCTOR

Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you

again.

FRANCES

I love you, Harry. I love you.

HARRY

I love you too, Frances.

FRANCES

I realize now that I was a very sick

woman.

WOMEN IN WARD

Sick! She's sick!

FRANCES

I couldn't relate to others in a

normal way.

ONE PATIENT

(playful warning)

She's... not... normal...!

FRANCES

And I was not taking responsibility

for my actions. But now, thanks to

your treatment, I feel ready to face

myself, ready to resume the career

which I so single-handedly shattered.

I only hope... I hope I can make you

all proud of me. Thank you. Thank

you so much.

LILLIAN

Of course, she hasn't anything

definite in mind.

FRANCES

No. No, it all depends on what offers

I get.

REPORTER

Who did your hair, Frances?

FRANCES

Well, I like to try different styles.

Sometimes if you're old-fashioned

enough, you find you're modern. Right,

Mama?

REPORTER

What do you think of all this, Mrs.

Farmer?

LILLIAN

It's a miracle. Just a miracle.

LILLIAN

Oh, just leave those things for now.

FRANCES

No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll

wash them in the morning.

LILLIAN

You know, little sister, I never

resented you for refusing to see me

in the... the hospital. I knew you

had to manage on your own before you

could come back.

FRANCES

Thank you for understanding, Mama.

LILLIAN

Little sister, I don't want you to

feel any rush to get back to work. I

want you to rest... for a while

anyway.

FRANCES

I will, I promise.

LILLIAN

Good night, dear.

HARRY

Where to?

FRANCES

Oh Harry...

HARRY

This is it, kid. This is our chance.

When you got a chance, you better

take it.

FRANCES

Yeah. I don't know.

HARRY

You don't need to screw around

anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele

or Odets or your mother. You need

me.

FRANCES

I know, but... There were so many

people in there, Harry. Every time I

turned around someone was pressing

against me... watching, looking over

my shoulder, touching me, grabbing,

sticking things into me. When I feel

somebody near me now... anybody...

my skin starts to crawl.

FRANCES

You can't change the things they did

to me, Harry. Only I can do that...

by myself.

HARRY

Been a lot of years, you know. A

long time waiting. For what? End up

feeling like a sap.

FRANCES

Oh please, Harry... don't even think

it. You're the only person who ever...

It's just... Can't you wait for me?

HARRY

I don't know.

FRANCES

(getting frantic)

Yes you do. If you love me you can

wait, right? A month, six months,

whatever it takes.

HARRY

Right. Except... time has a way of --

FRANCES

No, Harry, it's not time, it's us.

You and me. And I'm telling you now

that I'll come to you, okay? I'll

find you. I will.

HARRY

(smiles wistfully)

I hope so, Frances.

FRANCES

(disentangling)

I'm sorry.

HARRY

I'll be seeing you, kid.

HITCHHIKER

Pretty morning.

FRANCES

(nods)

It's always beautiful at this time.

Peaceful...

HITCHHIKER

And no people.

FRANCES

Yes.

HITCHHIKER

Where you goin'?

FRANCES

Wherever they're going, I'm going.

HITCHHIKER

Yeah, I know what that's like...

Where you been?

FRANCES

Well, I was picking fruit with some

migrant workers until...

HITCHHIKER

What's the matter?

HITCHHIKER

They're looking for you, huh?

FRANCES

Yeah.

HITCHHIKER

What'd you do?

FRANCES

You know, I've never been able to

figure that out.

HITCHHIKER

I've got a little whiskey here, warm

you up.

FRANCES

Thank you.

FRANCES

Wait. Maybe they'll pick you up.

FRANCES

Shit!

HITCHHIKER

Run!

FRANCES

Dad...? Why don't you stop at a side

road and let me out?

ERNEST

Francie, you know I can't do that.

FRANCES

Why? It's such a simple thing. You

just let me out and I disappear down

a road and you never have to see me

again.

ERNEST

They'll just catch you again, Francie.

Besides, your mother will know.

FRANCES

Dad, here! You don't have to stop,

just slow down. You can tell Mama I

jumped out. She knows that's the

kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame

you.

ERNEST

But I gave her my word. Besides,

she's still your legal guardian. My

hands are tied.

FRANCES

You know where you're taking me. You

know what she'll do. Just give me a

minute, slow down, give me an instant

for once in your life, please?

ERNEST

Please, Francie...

FRANCES

(pleading)

Daddy!

ERNEST

I'll try to protect you, Francie. I

will, I'll talk to her. We'll have a

real talk.

ERNEST

Are you... are you hungry?

FRANCES

I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.

FRANCES

(coldly)

Do I go right away or do I have time

to take a bath?

LILLIAN

I was hoping for a kind word, little

sister.

FRANCES

You were hoping for a kind word?!

You're my mother! You're supposed to

nourish me! Support me!

LILLIAN

I have!

FRANCES

No! All you've done is try to break

my spirit, try to turn me into you!

But I'm not you, mother, and I never

will be, and thank god for it!

(to Ernest)

That goes for you too! And frankly,

I don't know how, with the two of

you, I turned out as sane as I am --

(to the MEN IN WHITE

COATS who are at the

door)

Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be

with you in a minute... and believe

me, I don't want to stay here one

second longer than I have to!

(turning back)

But I've got to tell you, Lillian,

that one day before you die, you

will realize what you've done and

hang your head in shame. In shame!

LILLIAN

But what --

(have I done?)

FRANCES

No! You're not talking now. You

listen. You can send me away, Lillian,

you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend

I'm still your little girl who can't

take care of herself, but one thing

you can't pretend anymore. You can't

pretend I love you because I don't.

I can't. Not after what you've done

to me. Because you see... I'm still

me... I'm trying real hard all this

time to be me... and you, 'little

sister', you haven't been any help

at all.

(walking out the door)

Okay, boys, I'm ready.

FRANCES

We shall hear the angels, we shall

see the whole sky all diamonds...

SOLDIER #1

...Best deal I ever made. Twenty

bucks to fuck a fuckin' movie star.

SOLDIER #2

Yeah, it's worth it I guess.

SOLDIER #1

What's she saying, anyway?

SOLDIER #2

Who knows. She's crazy, ain't she?

DISSOLVE TO:

OLDER NURSE

I don't know why they even bother.

She's had enough of this to knock

sense into a bull elephant.

YOUNG NURSE

Yeah?

OLDER NURSE

(nods)

I checked the files. This one holds

the record for shock treatments.

Four hundred seventeen and no end in

sight.

YOUNG NURSE

(wincing)

You're kidding.

OLDER NURSE

(indicating the doctors)

Yeah, well, you know doctors. They

sure hate to use that word.

YOUNG NURSE

What?

OLDER NURSE

'Incurable.'

FRANCES

(to Doyle)

Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come.

I love you, Harry. I love... Take me

home, Harry.

DOYLE

We'll get you home, Frances.

FRANCES

Thank you, Harry.

DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.)

One merely inserts the leucotome

beneath the eyelid and presses up

into the prefrontal lobe, manipulating

it so as to sever the nervous

connections between the thalamofrontal

radiation and the body of the brain.

DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.)

Because of the speed and simplicity

of the operation, I am able, as you

are seeing, to perform the procedure

on ten patients in less than a half

hour.

DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.)

The operation is completely painless

and can be performed without any

sedative whatsoever.

DR. HARLINGTON

We have always known that this form

of radical treatment was effective,

but until now it couldn't be applied

on a large scale. The old procedure

required a full day's work by a

surgical team to perform a single

operation. In the same time, working

alone, I can treat fifty.

DR. HARLINGTON

This procedure works best on patients

with extreme over-reactions to

emotional stimuli. It can also be

used as a last resort on those who

seem impervious to other forms of

treatment.

DR. HARLINGTON

In plain language, my technique severs

the nerves which give emotional energy

to ideas. Along with the cure comes

a loss of affect... a kind of

emotional flattening...

DR. HARLINGTON

...with diminished creativity and

imagination. Patients become like

good solid cake with no icing. But,

after all, it is their emotions and

imaginations that are disturbed.

DR. HARLINGTON

These patients will soon be leaving

the hospital.

DR. HARLINGTON

Lobotomy gets 'em home.

CUT TO:

LILLIAN

What was I saying? Oh yes, it was

the Communists that did it to Frances.

LILLIAN

They capture the mind by first

seducing the heart. I suppose I never

taught Frances to close her heart...

REPORTER

Uh... excuse us, Mrs. Farmer. We're

going to have to... uh...

THIRD REPORTER

(rising)

Yeah, I better pack it in too.

LILLIAN

(distractedly)

Pardon? Oh, would you like more

lemonade?

FOURTH REPORTER

(kindly)

I think we've had enough. Thank you,

Mrs. Farmer. Goodbye.

LILLIAN

You know, Ernie, I think we should

have Frances' room repainted for

when she comes home. That'll brighten

her day.

EDWARDS

...Dwayne Steele divorced you, and

from this point on, your story takes

a darker turn. Shunned by the

Hollywood you criticized so harshly,

alienated from your family and

friends, you turn your back on

professional commitments in New York,

and alcohol and drugs enter your

life. These are sad, desperate times

for you.

EDWARDS

...until finally your mother finds

it necessary to commit you to a state

mental institution. Were you mentally

ill, Frances?

FRANCES

...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever

was sick. But when you're treated

like a patient long enough, you're

apt to act like one...

EDWARDS (O.S.)

Were you an alcoholic?

FRANCES (O.S.)

No.

EDWARDS (O.S.)

Were you a drug addict?

FRANCES (O.S.)

No. Never.

EDWARDS

...and over 200 producers have been

invited to watch your appearance

here tonight... so who knows, Frances

Farmer, anything's possible on your

comeback trail!

(indicating seating

area)

And since your friends tell me they

have to drive you everywhere, look

what we've got for you!

EDWARDS

A brand new 1958 Edsel!

FRANCES

Thank you, Ralph.

EDWARDS

Thank you, Frances. And after the

show we're hosting a reception for

you and your friends at Hollywood's

own Roosevelt Hotel!

EDWARDS

So, Frances Farmer, this is your

life. Good night. God bless you.

WOMAN

Where shall we drop you, Frances?

Home?

FRANCES

(vaguely)

No... no, someone's picking me up.

HARRY (O.S.)

Hey.

HARRY

C'mere. I want to talk to you.

FRANCES

(flatly)

Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see

you.

HARRY

How... how ya doin', Farmer?

FRANCES

Fine, thank you. Did you watch the

show?

HARRY

Sure I did, that's why I'm here.

FRANCES

(concerned)

How did I look?

HARRY

Oh, you...

(smiling)

...ennh.

FRANCES

(a glimmer, but she

does not pick up on

the cue)

Well... you're looking well.

FRANCES

I got a new car. Only it's red. Did

you know Mama died?

HARRY

Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.

FRANCES

Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a

faceless sinner, Harry...

HARRY

Why do you say that?

FRANCES

I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm

a faceless sinner.

(she smiles)

...You smell good, Harry. Familiar,

you know? I'd ask you to take me

home, but...

HARRY

(taking her by the

arm)

Frances!

FRANCES

Don't get mad at me, Harry. Please.

It's just... Some things happen for

the best.

FRANCES

It's going to be slow from now on.

Do you know what I mean, Harry?

HARRY

I'm not sure.

FRANCES

Very slow.

(uncertainly)

But we're not going to stop, are we?

HARRY

No.

FRANCES

(reassured)

No, we're not.

FRANCES

Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to

see you again.

HARRY

Yes. Would you like me to walk a

little way with you?

FRANCES

That would be okay.

HARRY

Just a little way.

FADE TO BLACK:

THE END
