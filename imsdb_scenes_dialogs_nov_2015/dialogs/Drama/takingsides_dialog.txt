TAKING SIDES

by Ronald Harwood

adapted from the play by

Ronald Harwood

Final Draft, 1988

ATTENDANT

(agitated)

Dr. Furtwangler, the Reichsminister.

REICHSMINISTER

Dr. Furtwangler, I want to apologise

personally for this power failure.

I was so enjoying the performance.

In times like these we need

spiritual nourishment.

REICHSMINISTER

But I welcome this unexpected

opportunity of talking to you.

(with great care)

When you came on to the platform

tonight, I thought you weren't

well.  You looked tired,

(a warning)

Get away from this bombing.

Away from the war.  Yes, you look

tired...

(a crooked smile)

Even in this light.

A MAN'S VOICE

Look at them. Men, women, kids.

Boy, did they love him. You see,

Steve, Adolf Hitler touched

something deep, real deep and savage

and barbaric, and it won't just go

away overnight. It's got to be

rooted out. You know what I think?

I think they were all Nazis. And

let's face it, their leaders, those

bastards now on trial in Nuremberg,

couldn't have done it alone. It's

these people, they gave all the

help that was needed. Willingly.

THE MAN'S VOICE

That's him.  Furtwangler. Wilhelm

Furtwangler.

WALLACE

So, you never heard of him.

STEVE

Nope.

WALLACE

Do you know who Arturo Toscanini

is?

STEVE

Sure.

WALLACE

He's as big as Toscanini, maybe

even bigger. In this neck of the

woods, he's probably Bob Hope and

Betty Grable rolled into one.

STEVE

Jeez, and I never heard of him.

WALLACE

You were in insurance before the

war.

STEVE

Right. Claims assessor.

WALLACE

Conscientious, determined, dogged.

STEVE

(amused)

They said I was dogged?

WALLACE

Well, they say here that when you

went on a case, you stayed on it.

(looks up at Steve.)

Now we can't take every Nazi in

this country to trial, although I

would like to; it's an

impossibility. So we're going for

the big boys in industry, education,

law, culture.

STEVE

Like this bandleader.

WALLACE

(a smile)

Well, he's more than just a

bandleader, Steve. He's a great

conductor, a gifted artist. But we

believe that he sold himself to

the devil. Your number one priority

from this moment on is to connect

him to the Nazi Party. Don't be

impressed by him. I want the folks

back home to understand why we

fought this war. Find Wilhelm

Furtwangler guilty. He represents

everything that was rotten in

Germany.

WALLACE

Stay put, Steve. There is some

other stuff that I'd like for you

to see here. Background.

WALLACE

Oh, one thing that may be a problem.

Our Occupation Authorities in

Wiesbaden have a duty to help these

poor unfortunates with their

defence. They keep repeating: 'We

must be just, we must be seen to

be just.' Well, I've only one thing

to say to the liberals in Wiesbaden:

fuck 'em.

(as he goes)

You answer to no one but me. Is

that understood?

(to the projectionist

in the door)

Show him the film.

PROJECTIONIST

Yes, sir. Roll it.

ARCHIVE FILM VOICE

That is the hand that dropped the

bombs on defenceless Rotterdam,

Brussels, Belgrade. That is the

hand that destroyed the cities,

villages and homes of Russia. That

is the hand that held the whip

over the Polish, Yugoslav, French

and Norwegian slaves. That is the

hand that took their food.

WALLACE

Next reel, please.

ARCHIVE FILM

Sanitary conditions were so

appalling that heavy equipment had

to be brought in to speed the work

of cleaning up. This was Bergen

Belsen.

AMERICAN RADIO VOICE

Remember, men, no fraternisation.

In a German town, if you bow to a

pretty girl or pat a blond child,

you bow to all that Hitler stood

for. You bow to his reign of blood.

You caress the ideology that meant

death and destruction. You never

know who was a member of the Nazi

Party. Don't be fooled. Don't

fraternise.

BOY

Cigarettes, chewing gum?

ADAMS

We're gonna have the heating fixed

by tonight.

ADAMS

Fraulein, this is Major Arnold.

Sir, this is your secretary,

Fraulein Emmi Straube. Her file's

on your desk. They sent her over

from Admin. I'll leave you to it.

STEVE

You live here, in Berlin?

EMMI

Yes.

STEVE

You do shorthand and typing?

EMMI

Yes.

STEVE

Okay, let's see. How long were you

in the camp for?

EMMI

Three months.

STEVE

Says here because of your father.

What's that mean?

EMMI

My father was one of the officers

in the plot against Hitler. They

arrested the plotters and their

families.

STEVE

Your mother, too.

EMMI

Yes. She suffered longer. She was

in Ravensbruck.

STEVE

And your father was executed.

STEVE

I'm gonna call you Emmi, you're

gonna call me Steve. Okay?

STEVE

I got a list of stuff here I'd

like you to get for me.

ADAMS

If you need anything, let me know.

EMMI

Major...

STEVE

Steve.

EMMI

There have been messages for you.

(She consults the

pad.)

A Lieutenant David Wills called

from the Allied Kommandatura

Cultural Affairs office in

Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.

EMMI

Then there have been three calls

from Dr. Furtwangler wanting to

know when you wish to see him. I

did not speak to him personally...

STEVE

Think you can get me any of that?

EMMI

(pleased)

Oh yes, Major, I have recordings

of all his symphonies. I kept them

safe during the bombing. My

favourite is the Seventh Symphony.

STEVE

Mine's the Eleventh.

EMMI

(puzzled)

But... he only wrote nine, Major.

STEVE

I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a

record player? You have that, too?

EMMI

No. Ours was damaged.

STEVE

(surveys the room)

What's in those files?

EMMI

The names of the members of the

Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since

1934 together with their

questionnaires.  Major, what am I

to tell Dr. Furtwangler?

STEVE

You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he

calls again, you say you know

nothing. We're gonna keep him

waiting while I get acquainted

with his case and with the

witnesses. And, God help me, with

Beethoven.

STEVE

Yeah.

DAVID

Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major

Arnold. Sir.

STEVE

For Chrissakes I hate that shit,

cut it out.

DAVID

I'm very sorry.

STEVE

I'm Steve. What's your name?

DAVID

David. David Wills. I'm your liaison

officer with the Allied Kommandatura

Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.

STEVE

Sounds a lot of run.

(studies David.)

So they sent the big guns to check

up on me. We recruiting children

now?

DAVID

(smiles')

I guess so, sir.

STEVE

You call me sir again and I'll

make you listen to Beethoven.

STEVE

Where you from, David?

DAVID

was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped

in '36. My parents, they sent me

to my uncle in Philadelphia. They

were to follow. But they delayed

and...

DAVID

Our family name was Weill. But

that doesn't sound well in English.

My uncle changed it to Wills and...

EMMI

I'm sorry.

STEVE

Come in, Emmi, this is your office,

too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David

Wills.

STEVE

He is here to watch over us.

STEVE

I guess you admire musicians.

DAVID

Some.

STEVE

Don't. This is like a criminal

investigation, David. Musicians,

morticians, doctors, lawyers,

butchers, clerks. They're all the

same.

STEVE

We have a duty, a moral duty.

EMMI

It works!  Hallelujah!

EMMI

Herr Rudolf Werner.

STEVE

Sit down, Werner.

STEVE

I want you to understand why you're

here. This is an investigation

into Wilhelm Furtwangler, former

Prussian Privy Councillor, banned

from public life under Control

Council Directive No 24 and who's

applied to come before the Tribunal

of Artists of the Denazification

Commission. I'm interested in what

he was up to from 1933 to the end

of the war, understood?

STEVE

Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section

since 1936. What instrument did

you play?

WERNER

First oboe.

STEVE

I have your questionnaire here. It

says you were never a member of

the Nazi Party.

WERNER

Absolutely not.

WERNER

No, I was never a Nazi, I have no

interest in politics, I'm a musician -

STEVE

Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube

has to take down what you say.

WERNER

Straube? Any relation to Colonel

Joachim Straube?

EMMI

My father.

WERNER

It's a great honour to meet you,

Fraulein. Your father was a great

patriot.

WERNER

Dr. Furtwangler is a great musician.

He actively opposed the Nazis and

later on he helped many Jews to

escape.

STEVE

Then how do you explain him being

made a Prussian Privy Councillor?

WERNER

It was Hermann Goering. I was told

he just made the maestro his Privy

Councillor, no questions asked.

Although Dr. Furtwangler stood up

to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.

STEVE

He also conducted for Hitler, didn't

he?

WERNER

Yes, that's true, but he refused

to give the Nazi salute. He kept

his baton in his right hand. In

Hitler's presence. That was a brave

act...

STEVE

Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's

birthday with some heroic piece by

Wagner but without the Nazi salute?

Bravo.

WERNER

It was Beethoven's Ninth.

STEVE

Do you really think it was brave?

Didn't he bow to him and shake his

hand?

SCHLEE

No, no, no, I give you my word. I

was never a member of the Nazi

Party. Never. I am in the percussion

section. I play the timpani.

SCHLEE

Anyway, they would never have

allowed it. My brother was married

to a Jewess, may she rest in peace.

And Goebbels said...

(to Emmi)

...please take this down carefully,

because it's most important,

Fraulein?

EMMI

Straube.

SCHLEE

(acting surprised)

Straube? Are you by any chance

related to Colonel Joachim Straube?

EMMI

My father.

SCHLEE

He was... he was a great hero.

SCHLEE

Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said,

'There's not a single filthy Jew

left in Germany on whose behalf

Dr. Furtwangler has not intervened.'

No, no one could have been less of

a Nazi than Dr. Furtwangler.

STEVE

But this was the same guy who

conducted for Adolf on his birthday.

SCHLEE

He was forced to do that. But he

refused to give the Nazi salute in

front of Hitler. He kept his baton

in his hand, you can't salute with

a baton in your hand.

DAVID

And what about the Nuremberg Rally?

SCHLEE

No, we...we played on the evening

before the Rally.

STEVE

(straight-faced)

Oh! The evening before, I see...

SCHLEE

Yes, Dr. Furtwangler was absolutely

clear about this: politics and art

must be kept separate.

STEVE

Politics and art must be kept

separate. I'll remember that. But

let me see if you can help me with

something I just don't understand.

I'd really like to know why all

you guys are so crazy about him.

What's his secret?

SCHLEE

Well, it's hard to explain. I can

only tell you from my own

experience. Soon after I joined

the orchestra, we were rehearsing

the Third Symphony of Beethoven,

the Eroica. There are several rather

difficult passages for the timpani.

One particular crescendo. During

the break, I asked how he wanted

it played. He was studying his

score. He didn't look up. He said,

'Just watch me.'  So, of course, I

did. I never stopped watching him.

The moment came. And suddenly, he

turned to me and our eyes were

locked. There was something in his

look that...  that simply demanded

the crescendo. I shall never forget

his look. It was a moment of... of

magic.

STEVE

You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes

when he was making a speech? I've

seen 'em on films.

SCHLEE

Yes.

STEVE

Was looking at Furtwangler like

that?

SCHLEE

I don't know what you mean, Major.

STEVE

When you got to the crescendo.

STEVE

You think a whole orchestra, what,

a hundred and forty or so guys,

could be orchestrated?

DAVID

I guess it's possible.

STEVE

So, what does the Russki want?

DAVID

Colonel Dymshitz asked specially

to see you.

STEVE

'Dim-shits'?

STEVE

What the hell are they doing?

DAVID

(whispered)

They're trying to sort out some of

the works of art the Nazis stole

from occupied territories. Who

really owns what? That's Colonel

Dymshitz, on the far side.

DAVID'S VOICE

art historian, head of the famous

Leningrad Museum of Art. He is an

expert on German culture.

VERNAY

(suddenly raising

his voice)

Je suis navre, Colonel, cette

peinture n'est pas la propriete de

I'union sovietique mats bien cette

de la France.

GREEN

What's he saying? Henri, what is

you saying?

AMERICAN AIDE

He's saying that picture is the

property of France

VERNAY

C'est un Braque qui avec Picasso

etait un des pionniers du cubisme.

DYMSHITZ

(in French)

I know who Georges Braque is,

Captain.

AMERICAN AIDE

(almost

simultaneously)

It's a Barque.

FRENCH AIDE

We can produce the provenance of

this Braque, you say provenance?

DYMSHITZ

Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz.

I'm glad to see you.

STEVE

Colonel. Pleasure.

DYMSHITZ

So, Major, tell me, have you

questioned Dr. Furtwangler?

STEVE

Not yet.

DYMSHITZ

I've had two meetings with him.

He's a great musician. Maybe the

greatest conductor in the world.

His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert -

unequalled.

DYMSHITZ

I'll come straight to point. I've

offered him a very attractive

position. Conductor of the

Staatsoper Unten den Linden. He

refused. But I want him. I want

him badly. And I want your help.

GREEN

Hey, just a moment, you should

have discussed this with me first.

DYMSHITZ

I'm discussing it with you now.

Major, I want you to drop your

investigation, save everybody time

and trouble.

GREEN

We can't drop a case just like

that.

DYMSHITZ

I'll give you another conductor in

exchange or writer, musician, actor

what...what do you care?  But I

like Furtwangler. He's my favourite

conductor.

(chuckles.)

Mine and Hitler's. He's our

favourite conductor.

DAVID

I clicked my heels, saluted and

bowed at the same time.

EMMI

That's because you had a proper

upbringing.

DAVID

That's right. I was raised very

strictly. So don't speak before

you are spoken to!

EMMI

Oh! And don't wave your hands about!

DAVID

Respect your elders and your

betters!

EMMI

And no elbows on the table!

DAVID

Eating is eating... and...

EMMI

And talking is talking! Well, I

think we better get on.

DAVID

Right. So, this is going to be

very formal, too, now. Lieutenant

David Wills requests die pleasure

of die company of Fraulein Emmi

Straube at dinner any night she

cares.

STEVE

David, need to ask you something.

You heard this rumour the British

found something called the Hinkel

Archive?

DAVID

Yes.

STEVE

So what is it?

DAVID

The British occupy the building

where this guy, Hinkel, ran the

Nazi Ministry of Culture and it

seems they've... they've discovered

his secret archive.

STEVE

What's that mean?

DAVID

I don't know, but the British are

excited about it, I know that. The

rumour is Hinkel kept a file on

every artist working in the Third

Reich.

STEVE

Jeez. And you think the British'll

share it with their Allies?

DAVID

Major Richards said he'd call to

let us know.

STEVE

That's big of him.

STEVE

Okay, better question the next

witness. I bet you a bottle of

French champagne he tells us the

baton story inside ten minutes.

DAVID

Five minutes.

STEVE

It's a bet. You're the witness,

Emmi.

STEVE

Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second

violinist since 1935. What's it

mean, second violinist?

RODE

It means I wasn't good enough to

be a first violinist.

STEVE

Good, and according to your

questionnaire, Helmuth, you never

joined the Nazi Party.

RODE

Me? Never.  Never.

RODE

I... I know everyone now says they

were never Nazis but in my case it

is absolutely one hundred per cent

true. I am a Catholic, it would

have been totally against my

conscience.

RODE

Is it true you're going to interview

Dr. Furtwangler today?

STEVE

I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.

RODE

Excuse me. Did you know that he

refused to give the Nazi salute

when Hitler was present in the

audience?

RODE

The problem was how could he avoid

giving the Devil's salute when

Satan was actually sitting there.

(modestly taps his

chest with his

thumb.)

And, I said, 'Dr. Furtwangler, why

not enter with the baton in your

right hand? Hitler will be sitting

in the front row. If you give the

salute with the baton in your right

hand it'll look like you're going

to poke his eyes out.'

RODE

He was...He was really grateful to

me for that. After the concert,

I... I stole that baton as a memento

of a great act of courage. I still

have it. I should have brought it

to show you. I hope I'm not going

too fast for you, Fraulein?-

EMMI

Straube.

RODE

Straube. Any relation to Colonel

Joachim Straube?

EMMI

My father.

RODE

(standing)

I am deeply honoured to be in your

presence, Fraulein Straube. Your

father was a true patriot, a man

of God.

STEVE

You have a question for Helmuth,

David?

DAVID

Yes. What was the orchestra's

reaction when they asked you to

play for Hitler's birthday?

RODE

Oh, we didn't play for his birthday,

we played the evening before - it

was the 19th of April not the 20th.

STEVE

Do you know Hans Hinkel?

RODE

(alarmed)

Do I know Hans Hinkel?

STEVE

That's what I asked.

RODE

Do I know Hans Hinkel?

STEVE

You seem to understand the question,

now how about answering it?

RODE

Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of

Culture; how could I know such a

man?  I

RODE

I hear the British have his... his

archive, files, records.

STEVE

Do you know what's in this archive?

RODE

How could I know what's in the

archive?

STEVE

Okay, you can go now, Helmuth. Get

out.

FURTWANGLER

Furtwangler.

EMMI

Major, Major... he's here ...

STEVE

Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down,

Emmi. We're going to keep him

waiting, too.

STEVE

Emmi, get us some coffee, will

you? And, Emmi, don't offer him

coffee. Don't even greet him, okay?

FURTWANGLER

Fraulein?

FURTWANGLER

How long am I to be kept waiting?

STEVE

Okay, Emmi, go get him.

EMMI

Dr. Furtwangler.

STEVE

I didn't hear anyone invite you to

sit down.

STEVE

Sit there.

STEVE

I want you to understand why you're

here. You're automatically banned

from public life under Control

Council Directive No 24. We're

here to look into your case before

you appear in front of the Tribunal

for Artists of the Denazification

Commission. You understand that?

FURTWANGLER

I have already been cleared by a

Denazification Tribunal in Austria.

STEVE

What they do in Austria doesn't

interest me one little bit. Okay?

I have your questionnaire here,

(reading)

Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm

Furtwangler, born Berlin, January

1886. Orchestral conductor. And

you say here you were never a member

of the Nazi Party.

FURTWANGLER

That is correct.

STEVE

Could you tell us about being made

a Prussian Privy Councillor. How

did that happen to a non-Party

member?

FURTWANGLER

I received a telegram from Hermann

Goering informing me that he had

made me a Privy Councillor. I was

not given the opportunity either

to accept or refuse. After the

dreadful events of November 1938,

the violent attacks on the Jews, I

stopped using the title.

STEVE

What about Vice-President of the

Chamber of Music, you used that

title didn't you? But then I suppose

you had no choice there either,

because I suppose Dr. Goebbels

just sent you a telegram saying,

Dear Mr. Vice-President.

FURTWANGLER

I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me

a telegram. I was simply told. In

a letter, I believe. I don't

remember exactly.

STEVE

Goebbels and Goering were sure

heaping honours on you. One makes

you a Privy Councillor, the other

makes you Vice-President of the

Chamber of Music, and you weren't

even a member of the Party, how do

you explain that?

FURTWANGLER

Well, there was a constant battle

between Goering and Goebbels as to

which of them would control German

culture. I was simply a pawn.

Anyway, I resigned from the

Musikkammer at the same time I

resigned as Musical Director of

the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.

In 1934.

DAVID

Why was that? Why did you resign,

Dr. Furtwangler?

FURTWANGLER

I wrote an open letter to the

newspapers condemning what they

were doing to music, making these

distinctions between Jews and non-

Jews. For my part, the only divide

in art is between good and bad.

Eventually, Goebbels summoned me

and told me I could leave the

country if I wanted to but under

no condition would I ever be allowed

to return. I always believe that

you have to fight from the inside

not from without. I asked myself,

what's the duty of an artist, to

stay or to leave? And then Goebbels

demanded that I acknowledge Hitler

as solely responsible for cultural

policy. Well, that was a fact and

it seemed pointless to deny it. I

simply acknowledged that Hitler

and the Minister of Culture

appointed by him were solely

responsible for the cultural policy

of the Reich. What I wanted to

express was that I, personally,

had no responsibility whatsoever

for their cultural policy. I have

always had the view that art and

politics should... should have

nothing to do with each other.

STEVE

Then why did you conduct at one of

their Nuremberg rallies?

FURTWANGLER

(flaring)

I did not conduct at at the rally,

I conducted on the evening before

the rally.

STEVE

That sounds like the small print

in one of our insurance policies,

Wilhelm. And what about April 19,

1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty-

third birthday, the big celebration;

you conducted for Hitler, didn't

you? Was that in keeping with your

view that art and politics have

nothing to do with each other?

FURTWANGLER

(flustered)

That... that was a different matter,

I... I was tricked.

STEVE

How come?

FURTWANGLER

Could I have a glass of water,

please? Please, Fraulein?

EMMI

Straube.

FURTWAANGLER

Thank you. I was in Vienna,

rehearsing the Ninth Symphony of

Beethoven, when Goebbels called

and said I had to conduct at

Hitler's birthday. I'd always

managed to wriggle out of such

invitations, pleading previous

engagements, illness, having my

doctors state I was not well and

so on and so on. I was also

fortunate that Baldur von Shirach,

who controlled Vienna, hated Dr.

Goebbels and would do anything to

thwart his wishes. But this time

Goebbels got to my doctors before

me; they were frightened off, and

von Schirach was threatened, bullied

and gave in. So, I had no

alternative but to conduct for

Hitler. Believe me, I knew I had

compromised, and I deeply regret

it.

STEVE

(playing with him)

Doesn't sound much of a trick to

me. Sounds like you made a deal.

FURTWANGLER

I made no deal!

STEVE

I don't buy that.

FURTWANGLER

It's the truth.

STEVE

I keep hearing you helped a lot of

Jews to escape. How did you do

that?

FURTWANGLER

I don't remember in detail, there

were so many.

STEVE

Did you call someone you knew?

FURTWANGLER

I may have, as... as I said, I

simply don't remember.

STEVE

Let me me help you, then. You picked

up the phone and made a call -

(Mimes a telephone.)

'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking.

Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy

musician I want you to help. He

needs a permit to get to Paris.'

STEVE

Or maybe you called Goebbels or

Goering? You were so close you

were in the same shithouse as them.

FURTWANGLER

May I ask a question?

STEVE

Sure.

FURTWANGLER

When will my case be heard by the

Tribunal?

STEVE

Your guess is as good as mine.

FURTWANGLER

I need to work. I need to make my

living. I live off the generosity

of friends...

STEVE

Tough, tough!

FURTWANGLER

(now more and more

agitated)

Then why is it, please, that another

conductor who was actually a member

of the Party, who used to play the

Horst Wessel before his concerts,

has already been cleared and is

working again while I have to wait

and wait and wait?

STEVE

I don't know, he wasn't my case.

Why did you escape to Switzerland

just before the war ended?

FURTWANGLER

It was because I learned that the

Gestapo was about to arrest me.

STEVE

Why were they going to arrest you?

FURTWANGLER

I believe it was because of another

letter I'd written to Goebbels

lamenting the decline of musical

standards due to racial policies.

STEVE

You didn't complain about the racial

policies, just about the musical

standards, is that right?

STEVE

So, how did you learn that the

Gestapo was out to get you?

FURTWANGLER

During an enforced hour-long

interval because of a power failure

at a concert here in Berlin, Albert

Speer, the Minister of Armaments,

said to me, 'You look very tired

Dr. Furtwangler, you should go

abroad for a while.' I knew exactly

what he meant.

STEVE

You sure knew a lot of people in

high places.

FURTWANGLER

It would be truer to say, I think,

that a lot of people in high places

knew me.

STEVE

You were real close to all of them,

to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph,

to Baldur, and now Albert,

(flaring)

So, let's hear the truth, let's

come clean. What was your Party

number?

FURTWANGLER

If you are going to bully me like

this, Major, you had better do

your homework. You obviously have

no idea how impertinent and stupid

your questions are.

STEVE

David, you remember I said I had a

question that he wouldn't be able

to answer? Well, I'm gonna ask it

now.  You ready for this, Wilhelm?

It's a tough one. Why didn't you

get out right at the start when

Hitler came to power in 1933? Why

didn't you leave Germany?

STEVE

I have a list of names here, people

in your profession, who got out in

'33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer,

Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...

FURTWANGLER

They were Jews, they had to leave.

They were right to leave.

(He breathes deeply,

summons strength.)

I could not leave my country in

her deepest misery. After all, I

am a German.  I... I stayed in my

homeland. Is that my sin in your

eyes?

STEVE

See, David? He can't answer the

question. I'll ask it again,

Wilhelm, and don't give me any

more airy-fairy, intellectual

bullshit!

EMMI

Major Arnold's office. Yes, he is.

EMMI

It's Major Richards for Lieutenant

Wills.

DAVID

David Wills. Yes, sir.

(listens.)

Well, you want me to tell him?

Okay,

(to Steve)

Major Richards wants a word with

you, sir.

STEVE

(muttering)

Why can't he just ask for me? Why

does he have to ask for you first?

Goddamn British, so correct!

STEVE

Steve Arnold...

FURTWANGLER

I've had enough of this, I'm

leaving.

DAVID

Dr. Furtwangler!  Dr. Furtwangler!

Please, please...

(a warning)

Don't. It's not advisable.

DAVID

(he gathers courage)

When I was a child, my father, he

took me to... he took me to one of

your concerts. I remember you

conducted Beethoven's Fifth

Symphony. I was deeply moved. And

I've loved music ever since. I was

grateful to you. And I've admired

you. How could you... how could

you serve those criminals?

STEVE

How many?  Jesus, that's dynamite!

Okay.

EMMI

Dr. Furtwangler.

STEVE

Well now. Aren't we all sociable?

STEVE

I've got to hand it to the British,

David. You know what those guys

are?  Decent.

(He sits, crosses

his legs.)

Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwangler, do

you know Hans Hinkel?

FURTWANGLER

Yes, a despicable human being. He

was in the Ministry of Culture.

His job was to get rid of Jews in

the arts.

STEVE

Yup, that's him, that's the guy.

You know what else the little creep

did? He kept files, close on 250,000

files. And you know what's in those

files?

FURTWANGLER

Certainly not, but I knew he had

informers everywhere. Even in my

orchestra there was someone

STEVE

Who?

FURTWANGLER

I wasn't told. I just knew it.

STEVE

How?

FURTWANGLER

(uneasy)

I was warned.

STEVE

Who warned you?

FURTWANGLER

(lowering his head)

Goering. Because Hinkel was working

for Goebbels.

STEVE

What did Goering say?

FURTWANGLER

He told me to be careful as one of

Goebbels' men was watching me. He

read a report on me - everything I

said was quoted word by word.

STEVE

Oh boy, you're gonna love this.

Take your time with this now. Those

files contain the details of every

working artist in this country.

Those files are gonna tell us who

joined the Party, who informed and

who was helpful.

SECURITY

Your name, please.

DAVID

David Wills.

SECURITY

Over there.

STEVE

Fantastic! The only condition is

we have to do the work here. I

want you to collect all the files

on the boys in the band.

EMMI

Maybe you can have a look at this.

DAVID

(a whisper)

Schubert.

DYMSHITZ

Dr. Furtwangler -

DYMSHITZ

Moving, you agree? Whenever I hear

Schubert I am moved.  You agree?

FURTWANGLER

The tempi were a little too correct

for my taste. But I expect that is

because of the rain.

DYMSHITZ

(also for David's

benefit)

Wait, Doctor, I understand you

have difficulties with the

Americans. I want you to know, I

am your champion. We can help.

EMMI

(frowning, worried)

What does he mean, too correct?

DAVID

I don't know.

STEVE

Well, what is this, the office

party?

STEVE

May I join you?

(sits down, beams.)

So, what have you two been up to

tonight? Hey. Don't I owe you a

bottle of French champagne?

STEVE

You know, David, you're a lucky

guy. I invited Emmi here but she

turned me down. You must've hidden

depths, David...

STEVE

C'mon, Emmi, let's dance. I'll

teach you how to jive.

DAVID

I'm very sorry, Major, but I

promised her mother, we have to

go.

EMMI

Don't see me to my door, there's

no need.

DAVID

But I promised your mother.

EMMI

Well, sleep well.

EMMI

Excuse me, Major. I found this on

Helmuth Rode. You remember? The

second violinist? Look, he's

Austrian not German. But it's this

that's more important, I think...

AN OFFICER

Sssh!

SERGEANT

Lieutenant Wills, telephone -

THE OFFICER

(exasperated)

What is this, a railway station?

DAVID

(into telephone)

David. Wills. Hello? Who? Who in

Wiesbaden?

Irritated, he taps the receiver but the line's gone dead.

RODE

Major.

STEVE

(eyes still closed)

Helmuth.

RODE

Guess what I am holding in my hand.

You like guessing games?

STEVE

Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What

are you holding in your hand?

RODE

It's Dr. Furtwangler's baton, which

I stole.

STEVE

The one he kept in his right hand.

Yes, you remember.

RODE

Yes, you remember.

STEVE

How could I forget?

STEVE

Show me.

RODE

Show you?

STEVE

Yeah, show me, I want to see you

do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're

the maestro, and you have the baton

in your right hand, but you give

me the salute just the same.

RODE

Not here, Major, there are people,

if anybody should see... please,

please, Major...

STEVE

Do it, Helmuth.

STEVE

Do it right.

STEVE'S VOICE

You look great doing that.

STEVE

And I see what you mean. You nearly

poked my eyes out.

RODE

Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives

Steve the case.

STEVE

Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our

secret.

BOY

Mister, mister, here, here,

mister!!!

STEVE

Great catch, kid. The boy runs

off.

RODE

So. You wanted to see me.

RODE

You usually don't work on Sunday,

Major?

STEVE

All in the cause of humanity,

Helmuth. Or should I call you one-

zero-four-nine-three-three-one?

RODE

What?

STEVE

One-zero-four-nine-three-three-

one. Or d'you mind if I just call

you 'one'?

STEVE

You know what I say you are,

Helmuth? I say you're a piece of

shit.

RODE

That bastard!

STEVE

Who's the bastard, Helmuth? Hinkel?

STEVE

Why? He promised to remove your

file?

STEVE

And what about before that? What

were you a member of in Austria?

STEVE

Was a member of...?  Speak up?

RODE

(barely audible)

I was a member of the Communist

Party. I was a communist. That's

what Hinkel had over me. He knew

everything. He held that over me.

That's how he made me co-operate.

STEVE

Oh, I see, he made you co-operate.

And now are you a communist again?

RODE

(angry)

You don't know what it's like to

wake up every single morning of

your life terrified, you don't

know that -

(he stops.)

RODE

I would never, in my wildest dreams,

have ever been a second violinist

in the Berlin Philharmonic. When

they got rid of the... the Jews in

the orchestra, it gave people like

me a chance.

STEVE

Helmuth, you ever heard of plea-

bargaining?

STEVE

Talk about power, I have the power

to give you work, make your life

easier. Your past won't be

mentioned. I could give you a job

tomorrow but I have to get something

in return. See, Helmuth? That's

plea-bargaining.

STEVE

I can give you freedom of movement,

freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth.

But I need something in return.

RODE

Major, we're discussing a man of

genius, I don't want...

STEVE

Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to

discuss symbols here?  This guy

was a front man. He was the piper,

but he played their tune, you get

my philosophical meaning?  I'm not

interested in small fish, I'm after

Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard

facts.

RODE

The only thing I know is he's an

anti-Semite.

STEVE

Of course. You, too. Like everyone

else in this goddamn country.

RODE

I've remembered something else...

STEVE

Yeah?

RODE

Furtwangler sent Hitler a telegram

for his birthday.

STEVE

He did?

RODE

One of your people told me.

STEVE

One of my people?

RODE

Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew.

He said he'd seen the telegram in

the Chancellery.

STEVE

Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the

corporal and we'll find the

telegram.

STEVE

But I need documentary proof. You

know of anything like that?

RODE

No. But that's why we hated him.

We admired him as a conductor but

we all hated him too because he

didn't have to join the Party and

yet he had a better life than any

of us. He didn't have to go and

deliver a report after every trip

abroad. He got everything from

them, everything. He was filthier

than any of us Party members.

RODE

There's a rumour... I don't know

if it's true or not... but ask him

about von der Null.

STEVE

Never heard of him, who is he?

RODE

Edwin von der Null. Music critic.

He gave Furtwangler terrible reviews

while he raved about Herbert von

Karajan.

STEVE

Who's he?

RODE

Also a conductor. Very brilliant.

Young. Von der Null called him

'The Miracle von Karajan'.

Furtwangler was outraged and they

say he had von der Null conscripted

into the army. The same thing

happened to another critic. True

or not, it's not such a bad idea.

Critics give you bad reviews, you

have them sent to the Russian front.

(Chuckks.)

But if you really want to get

Furtwangler, ask him about Herbert

von Karajan.

STEVE

The Miracle Kid.

RODE

Yes, yes you may notice that he

cannot even bring himself to utter

his name, he... he refers to him

as K.

RODE

And ask him about his private life.

STEVE

His private life?

RODE

Yes, it's all in here. His women.

'KARAJAN,H.VON'

MARTIN

Where do you stand on all this?

DAVID

On all what?

MARTIN

On Furtwangler.

DAVID

I don't know.

MARTIN

You represent the United States

now. We have a moral duty to be

just and we have to be seen to be

just.

DAVID

Major Arnold believes he has a

moral duty, too.

MARTIN

Our duty is to help Furtwangler

with his defence,

(carefully)

That's why I want you to look at

this...

(he selects papers

from the table.)

These are part of the transcripts

of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't

get them translated fast enough.

But I guess you understand German,

right?

MARTIN

That's the evidence of a guy named

Dahlerus. He's a Swede. Friend of

Hermann Goering. I want you to

study it. And I want you to use

it.

MARTIN

We're going to find more stuff to

feed you. We'll have some other

suggestions. We need to build a

case for the defence - based not

on feelings, not on prejudice, but

on facts.

WERNER

Lieutenant Wills.

WERNER

Herr Schlee, timpanist, Herr Romer,

cello and Herr Schmidt, viola.

They are willing to help. We have

already ordered ourselves coffee.

I hope you...

DAVID

Yeah, of course.

WERNER

The whole orchestra will vouch for

him. He was always there to support

us.

DAVID

We need names, if possible with

addresses, because it's urgent.

Names of musicians saved by Dr.

Furtwangler, people he helped to

escape abroad. Let's go somewhere

public.

DYMSHITZ

To co-operation.

STEVE

I was in Vienna. I had with me an

Austrian chauffeur, Max his name

was, he spent time in the camps.

We were looking at these Viennese

cleaning up the bomb damage,

scavenging for rotting food, butt

ends, anything. I said, 'To think

a million of these people came out

to welcome Adolf on the day he

entered the city, a million of

'em, and now look at 'em.'  And

Max said, 'Oh, not these people,

Major. These people were all at

home hiding Jews in their attics.'

You get the point, Colonel? The

point is they're all full of shit.

DYMSHITZ

Furtwangler's in a different

category.

STEVE

We're dealing with degenerates

here.

DYMSHITZ

Degenerates?

DYMSHITZ

A great artist will have great

privileges in a Russian zone.

STEVE

That's why he didn't get the hell

out of here when he had the chance!

I put that to him, he couldn't

answer. Why didn't he go and direct

in America, like that Italian,

Toscanini.

DYMSHITZ

(lost for a moment)

Perhaps... perhaps he believed he

could at least try to preserve

something important, things like

an orchestra, a school. That's his

country. Maybe he has an old mother

who can't be left alone. Maybe he

has brothers, sisters... you

can't...

STEVE

(a wry smile)

Colonel. He had no sisters, no

brothers, only a lot of love

affairs.

DYMSHITZ

Anyway, Major, why should he leave

his country, his mother tongue,

his family, his history, his past,

his future, just because now,

suddenly, there is a dictatorship?

Why?

STEVE

But what... before that turns

rotten...  What if they surround

the space with barbed wire, Colonel?

DYMSHITZ

(suddenly exploding)

Don't talk about things you know

nothing about. He was in a

dictatorship!

STEVE

(dismissive)

Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah,

yeah, I heard all about that.

DYMSHITZ

(angry)

In a dictatorship, art belongs to

the Party. If you want to be a

conductor, you have to have an

orchestra. And you can only get an

orchestra if you have contact with

the power. All over the world you

need the right contacts and you

have to make the right compromises.

STEVE

This is what I'm saying. He must

have had Party contacts.

DYMSHITZ

There are good Party members who

help, and there are dirty non-Party

members who inform on you. Of

course, they gave him privileges.

DYMSHITZ

And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you

notice that they like you. They

honour you, suddenly you are the

director of the best museum in the

world, for example.

STEVE

What museum?

DYMSHITZ

I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said

orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.

(another sudden

change of mood to

earnest, intimate)

Help me, Steve. You say you answer

for someone from high up. I, too,

have orders from high up. Very

high up. We want Furtwangler. I'll

give you in return the whole

orchestra, four, five conductors.

I need him, Steve.

STEVE

No can do.

DYMSHITZ

Let Furtwangler go. Please.

STEVE

I have a duty.

DYMSHITZ

(flaring)

Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking

duty. Trouble is, you Americans

want everybody to live like you.

We liberated Berlin, Major Steve,

not you. Our duty also is to bring

back the best of German culture.

STEVE

I'm gonna get that fucking

bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No

fucking deal.

DYMSHITZ

Then you're going to kill me.

ARCHIVES

You'll see ruins, you'll see

flowers, you'll see some mighty

pretty scenery, don't let it fool

you. You are in enemy country. The

Nazi party may be gone, but Nazi

thinking, Nazi training and Nazi

trickery remain. Somewhere in this

Germany are two million ex-Nazi

officials. Out of power but still

in there and thinking, thinking

about next time. Remember that

only yesterday every business,

every profession was part of

Hitler's system. Practically every

German was part of the Nazi network.

They believed they were born to be

masters. Don't argue with them.

You are not being sent Germany as

educators. You're a soldier on

guard. You will observe their local

laws, respect their costumes and

religion and you will respect their

property rights. You will not be

friendly. You will be aloof,

watchful and suspicious.

DAVID

Yesterday I read that Furtwangler

was asked to lead the New York

Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini

suggested it. Had he accepted, he

would have become the most

celebrated conductor in America.

EMMI

When he made his decision, he

couldn't have known everything.

Especially not the way people like

you do, who've returned from exile

and feel that you have a right to

pass judgement. Because you are

blameless, you think you know best

who is a sinner and who deserves

forgiveness. But you have no idea

how people lived here.

DAVID

When he met Hitler at his birthday

and shook hands with him, was he

pleased?

EMMI

I don't know. But you and I already

know that he has saved lives.

EMMI

Bruckner's Seventh, Major.

STEVE

Do you know where the Adagio begins?

EMMI

Of course.

STEVE

Put it on ready to play, and I'll

tell you when to play it.

FURTWANGLER

It is now nine o'clock precisely.

I do not intend to be kept waiting

again.

STEVE

(dangerously calm)

Don't talk to me like I was a second

violinist. Go back into the waiting

room. Miss Straube will come and

get you when I am ready to see

you.

STEVE

Jesus God, who the hell does he

think he is? Who the hell does he

think he is?

RODE

Would you perhaps like to have a

glass of water, Herr Professor?

FURTWANGLER

What is this man doing here?

STEVE

Dr. Furtwangler!  Come in, come

in, sit down.

STEVE

No, no, take this one, it's more

comfortable

STEVE

If it's too hot, open your tie.

FURTWANGLER

(interrupting)

I wish to say something.

STEVE

Go ahead, be my guest.

FURTWANGLER

When I last saw you, I was

unprepared. I did not know what to

expect. In these past weeks, I

have been thinking more carefully

and making some notes.

(glances at the

notes.)

You have to understand who I am

and what I am. I am a musician and

I believe in music. I am an artist

and I believe in art. Art in

general, and music, in particular,

has for me mystical powers which

nurture man's spiritual needs. I

must confess, however, to being

extremely naive.  I insisted for

many years on the absolute

separation of art and politics. My

entire life was devoted to music

because, and this is very important,

because I thought that I could,

through music, do something

practical.

STEVE

And what was that?

FURTWANGLER

Maintain liberty, humanity and

justice.

STEVE

Gee, that's a thing of beauty,

honest to God, a real thing of

beauty. I'm going to try to remember

that. Liberty, humanity and justice.

Beautiful. But you used the word

'naive'. Are you now saying you

think you were wrong? That art and

politics can't be separated?

FURTWANGLER

I believe art and politics should

be separate, but that they weren't

kept separate I learned to my cost.

STEVE

And when did you first learn that -

when you sent the telegram? Was

that the surrender signal, the

waving of the white flag?

FURTWANGLER

What telegram?

STEVE

'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love

Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect.

That sounds to me like you were

dropping on your knees and saying,

'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the

number one man. Have a swell party.'

FURTWANGLER

I have no idea what you're talking

about.

STEVE

The birthday greetings you sent to

your old pal, Adolf Hider.

FURTWANGLER

I never sent him any birthday

greetings or any other kind of

greetings.

STEVE

Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe

not in your own name, but as Privy

Councillor or Vice-President.

FURTWANGLER

I don't have to think carefully.

This is utterly ridiculous.

STEVE

Yes, David?

DAVID

Why not show Dr. Furtwangler the

evidence. It may refresh his memory?

FURTWANGLER

You won't find it because no such

telegram exists.

STEVE

Well, I tried, you got to admit I

tried. I thought I might just trap

you there, Wilhelm, but David here

was too quick for me. Smart move,

David, smart move. No, I don't

have the telegram, but I know it

exists. And I want you to know,

Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking

for it because I believe you sent

it.

FURTWANGLER

Then you are wrong.

STEVE

Art and politics, yeah, art and

politics. Let's look at that. You

and the Berlin Philharmonic toured

the Third Reich, played in countries

the Nazis had conquered. Are you

saying that conducting in occupied

territories from 1939 on wasn't a

commercial for Adolf and all he

stood for?

FURTWANGLER

We never, never officially

represented the regime when we

played abroad. We always performed

as a private ensemble. As I think

I already told you, I was a

freelance conductor.

STEVE

You know something? You should've

written our insurance policies for

us because you got more exclusion

clauses than Double Indemnity.

What do you imagine people thought?

The Berlin Philharmonic's taken

over by Doctor Goebbels and his

Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is

a freelance, so art and politics

are now entirely separate? Is that

what you believed ordinary people

thought?

FURTWANGLER

have no idea what ordinary people

thought.

STEVE

No!

FURTWANGLER

No, because I had only one

intention. My only intention

whatever I did was to show that

music means more than politics.

STEVE

Tell me about von der Null.

FURTWANGLER

(taken off-guard)

Von der Null?

STEVE

Yes, von der Null.

FURTWANGLER

Von der Null?

STEVE

How long's this going to go on,

Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you

say von der Null, I say von der

Null, you say von der Null, we

could go on all day. You know who

von der Null is, don't you? Edwin

von der Nuell, music critic.

FURTWANGLER

Yes, I know who he is.

STEVE

Isn't it true that because he gave

you bad reviews and praised this

young guy, Von Karajan, called him

a goddamn miracle, said he was a

better conductor than you, then

you had von der Null conscripted

into the army and no one's heard

from him since?

FURTWANGLER

That's an outrageous lie!

STEVE

You sure you didn't call one of

your close buddies and say, God in

heaven, did you see what that guy

von der Null wrote about me? The

greatest conductor on earth. I

want him out the way. He had the

nerve to accuse me I am not playing

enough modern music. Send him to

Stalingrad. Isn't that what you

did? You don't like criticism, do

you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't

like them saying there was another

conductor who was better than you...

Are you saying the name von der

Null was never mentioned in your

talks with Goebbels?

FURTWANGLER

(uncomfortable)

Well. Once he said he'd read what

this man wrote about me.

STEVE

And what did he say?

FURTWANGLER

He said, 'Don't mind him. His job

is to criticise, your job is to

conduct.'

STEVE

And what happened to Von der Nul?

FURTWANGLER

I have no idea.

STEVE

You've really no idea? I'll tell

you what happened. He died in

Stalingrad.

FURTWANGLER

I'm sorry.

STEVE

Now, that young conductor what's

his name?

(playing with

Furtwangler)

That miracle kid, you know who I

mean. Von Karajan! But you called

him something else. C'mon. What

did you call von Karajan?

STEVE

Say it.

STEVE

I'll say it, then. 'Little K.' Is

that right? You couldn't even bear

to say his name!

FURTWANGLER

Please stop playing these games

with me. Why you should bring up

the name of another conductor is

beyond my understanding.

STEVE

I'll tell you why. You remember we

talked about you playing for

Hitler's birthday?  And you told

me that Goebbels got to your doctors

first, that you were tricked?

FURTWANGLER

Yes, that's what happened.

STEVE

I have a different story to tell.

I don't think you were tricked.

Not in the way you describe. I

believe something else happened.

I've seen the Hinkel Archive, I've

seen records of phone calls, and

putting it all together, this is

what I think happened. I think

Goebbels said, 'Wilhelm, if you

won't conduct for Adolf's birthday,

we'll get the Miracle Kid, the guy

that critic, von der Null, thinks

is the greatest conductor in the

world. He's not just willing to

conduct for Adolf, he's offered to

sing "Happy Birthday" as a solo.'

STEVE

Come on, admit it. K worried you,

didn't he? He always worried you.

In 1942, he's thirty-four years

old, you're already fifty-six. And

Goebbels and Goering keep saying

to you, 'If you don't do it, little

K will.' Never mind art and politics

and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit

about liberty, humanity and justice

because I don't care how great you

are. It's the oldest story in the

book,

(a wry look at David)

The ageing Romeo jealous of the

young buck. The real reason you

didn't leave the country when you

knew you should have was that you

were frightened that, once you

were out of the way, you'd be

supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the

Party's boy twice over, flashy,

talented little K.

FURTWANGLER

This is absolute nonsense!

STEVE

Well, I'm just beginning to develop

my theme. Isn't that what you call

it in classical music, developing

your theme? Okay, so they played

on your insecurity. That's human,

understandable. But, there is one

guy who doesn't like little K as

much as he likes you - yeah, the

number one man your old pal, Adolf.

He thinks you're the greatest, and

when he says, I want Wilhelm for

my birthday, boy, they better go

out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls

and threatens you with little K.

And you said to hell with the Ninth

in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf

as a birthday present in Berlin.

That's the trick they played, they

got you by the balls and they

squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay?

Why did you play for them? Why

were you the flag-carrier for their

regime?  Jealousy?

FURTWANGLER

(interrupting)

Of course there was a conspiracy

against me, a campaign - even

abroad.

STEVE

You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about

ordinary, everyday reasons. Which

is why I want to discuss your

private life.  How many illegitimate

children do you have?

DAVID

Major, I don't see how this line

of questioning could...

STEVE

David, what are you Counsel for

the Defence now? (

(to Furtwangler)

Did you hear the question?

FURTWANGLER

(barely audible)

I have illegitimate children.

STEVE

What?

FURTWANGLER

I said I have illegitimate children.

I don't know how many.

STEVE

You like the women, don't you,

Wilhelm?

STEVE

Isn't it true that before every

concert you got a woman in your

dressing room and gave her the old

conductor's baton, isn't that true?

DAVID

(indicating EmmI)

Major, this is deeply offensive

and repugnant!

STEVE

You bet.

DAVID

and totally irrelevant.

STEVE

(continuing to

Furtwangler)

Not so, Counsellor. That secretary

of yours, she wasn't just your

secretary, she procured women for

you, didn't she? As many and as

often as you wanted.

FURTWANGLER

Stop this, please, stop this now!

STEVE

No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler

himself offered you a beautiful

house and a personal bomb shelter.

FURTWANGLER

I absolutely refused the house and

the bomb shelter.

STEVE

But you see what I'm getting at?

You get a gorgeous house, you're

highly paid. What are you gonna

do, stay or leave? One voice comes

back at me: stay!

DAVID

Major, that's not a good argument.

If Dr. Furtwangler did indeed enjoy

all these... these privileges, he

enjoyed them because of who he is

and what he is. That's true of any

leading artist in any country in

the world.

STEVE

But it still doesn't make them

saints. They still have to get up

and piss in the middle of the night,

don't they? They can still be

vindictive and envious and mean

just like you and me. Well, just

like me. Can't they?

STEVE

Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go

home and think about these past

twelve years.

FURTWANGLER

I don't understand what you mean.

STEVE

No, that's your problem, Wilhelm.

You understand nothing. We'll call

you. Go!

DAVID

Major.

STEVE

What?

DAVID

Your manner.

STEVE

My manner? Why don't you go

downstairs, get a cup of coffee

and calm down? What's the matter,

Emmi? What's going on with you?

What's wrong?

EMMI

I'm sorry but I have to leave.

I'll find other work. You'll have

to get someone else, that's all.

STEVE

What is this, Emmi?

EMMI

I can't do this. It's not right.

STEVE

What's not right?

EMMI

I have been questioned by the

Gestapo just like that. Just like

you questioned him.

STEVE

Emmi, stop! I want to show you

something. Let me show you something

and then if you want to leave, you

can leave, please please. His

friends, they did this. And he

gave them birthday concerts.

EMMI

But he had no idea, a lot of people

had no idea. I only realised what

was really going on when I got

arrested.

STEVE

If he had no idea, why did the

Jews need saving? This is the

question, Emmi, to all Germans:

Why did the Jews need saving in

this country? Why, if people had

no idea?

EMMI

I would like to go now, please.

DAVID

Can I ask you a favour, Major?

STEVE

Yeah.

DAVID

When you question him again, could

you treat him with more respect?

STEVE

With more what? More what?

DAVID

Major, he may just be the greatest

conductor of this century and that

merits respect.

STEVE

(flaring, hissing)

David, I don't understand a thing

about you. You're a Jew. Are you a

Jew?

DAVID

Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think

first I'm a human being.

STEVE

A human being, oh, good, I'm

relieved, I thought you were going

to say you were a music lover.

This man, this great artist has

made anti-Semitic remarks like you

wouldn't believe. I got letters.

DAVID

Major, show me someone who hasn't

made an anti-Semitic remark and

I'll show you the gates of paradise.

STEVE

(over-reacting and

overlapping)

What is it with you, David? Where

are your feelings? Where's your

hatred, your disgust? Where's your

fucking outrage, David?

STEVE

Think of your parents, David, and

then think of him conducting 'Happy

Birthday, dear Adolf'. I mean, for

Chrissake, whose side are you on?

Grow up! Just grow the fuck up!

CUT TO:

DAVID

I want you to come back to the

office. May I come in? If you are

there you can influence what

happens. What good can you do by

leaving. If you go, you are giving

up and how can you help Furtwangler

or me? Don't think about leaving.

Stay.

STEVE

Everybody says what a great

benefactor you were to the Jews.

But--

(holds up a sheaf

of papers.)

I have things here you said and

wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew

composer Schonberg is admired by

the Jewish International.' And

what about this: 'Jewish musicians

lack a genuine affinity with our

music.' 'Jewish musicians are good

businessmen with few scruples,

lacking roots.' You deny you said

these things?

FURTWANGLER

Those attitudes do not exist in

me.

STEVE

I believe that. But just answer

the question, don't give me

explanations.

FURTWANGLER

Speaking to Party members I used

their language, of course I did,

everyone did.

DAVID

(with some irony)

Major, sorry to interrupt, but

maybe we have to... maybe we have

to balance those things against

his assistance to his Jewish

colleagues.

DAVID

This is a transcript of the

proceedings at Nuremberg.

A Swedish businessman, Birger

Dahlerus, testified in cross-

examination that he had several

meetings with Hermann Goering. 'I

first saw Goering,' Dahlerus

testified, 'embroiled in a stormy

interview with Wilhelm Furtwangler,

the famous conductor of the Berlin

Philharmonic, who was vainly seeking

permission to keep his Jewish

concert master.

DAVID

Emmi, pick one of these, any one,

read it out loud.

EMMI

(reading)

'Please remember that Dr.

Furtwangler risked his life to

help anyone who asked him. I

personally testify to having seen

literally hundreds of people lined

up outside his dressing room after

concerts to ask for his help. He

never turned anyone away. After he

heard me play... I am a violinist...

he gave me money because I was

unable to feed myself or my family

and then he helped me to escape to

Sweden. He helped countless people

in similar ways.'

DAVID

And this, only one of these letters,

Major. I have lots of them.

STEVE

(smiling)

How many times have I got to tell

you I was in insurance? You think

I can't smell a phoney policy when

it's shoved under my nose? Sure,

he helped Jews, but that was just

insurance, his cover, because all

the while he was maestro of all he

surveyed,

(turning on

Furtwangler)

See, Wilhelm, I think you're their

boy, their creature. You were like

an advertising slogan for them:

this is what we produce, the

greatest conductor in the world.

And you went along with it. The

truth of the matter is, Wilhelm,

you didn't need to be a member of

the Party. I made a mistake when I

asked you for your Party number. I

should've asked you for your non-

Party number. Just like some other

well-known artists.

(suddenly, to Emmi)

Emmi, put that record on.

STEVE

Do you know what that is?

FURTWANGLER

Of course I know what that is.

STEVE

Okay, so what is it?

FURTWANGLER

Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.

STEVE

Who's conducting?

FURTWANGLBR

I am.

STEVE

You know the last time it was played

on these air waves?

FURTWANGLER

How can I know such a thing?

STEVE

I'll tell you, then. The last time

this music was played on these air

waves was after they announced

that your pal Hitler had shot

himself. Listen to it.  They listen.

Did they pick little K's recording?

Did they pick some other conductor?

No, they picked you, and why?

Because you represented them so

beautifully. When the Devil died,

they wanted his bandleader to

conduct the funeral march. You

were everything to them.

FURTWANGLER

(near to breakdown

but struggling for

control)

I have always tried to analyse

myself carefully and closely. In

staying here, I believed I walked

a tightrope between exile and the

gallows. You seem to be blaming me

for not having allowed myself to

be hanged.

FURTWANGLER

I didn't directly oppose the Party

because I told myself, that was

not my job. If I had taken any

active part in politics I could

not have remained here. But as a

musician, I am more than a citizen.

I am a citizen of this country in

that eternal sense to which the

genius of great music testifies. I

know that a single performance of

a great masterpiece was a stronger

and more vital negation of the

spirit of Buchenwald and Auschwitz

than words.

STEVE

(quiet, terrifying)

Have you ever smelled burning flesh?

I smelt it four miles away. Four

miles away, I smelt it. Have you

ever seen the gas chambers, the

crematoria? Have you seen the mounds

of rotting corpses? You talk to me

about culture, art and music? You

putting that in the scales, Wilhelm?

You setting culture, art and music

against the millions put to death

by your pals? They had orchestras

in the camps. They played Beethoven,

Wagner. The hangmen were playing

chamber music at home with their

families. I don't understand the

Germans' relationship with music.

What do you need music for? Your

pals you could call to save a few

Jews when millions of them were

being annihilated? Yes, I blame

you for not getting hanged, I blame

you for your cowardice. You strutted

and swaggered, you fucking piece

of shit, king-pin in a shithouse.

You talk to me about walking a

tightrope between exile and the

gallows, and I say to you, lies!

FURTWANGLER

(breaking down)

I love my country, I believe in

music, what was I to do?

STEVE

Look around you. See the country

you served. Look at people who had

real courage, who took risks, who

risked their lives. Like Emmi's

father.

STEVE

Emmi, take your fingers out of

your ears!

STEVE

I'm talking about your father.

EMMI

My father only joined the plot

when he realised that we could not

win the war.  She cries quietly.

FURTWANGLER

(desperate)

What kind of a world do you want,

Major? What kind of world are you

going to make? Do you honestly

believe that the only reality is

the material world, so you will be

left nothing, nothing but

feculence... more foul-smelling

than that which pervades your

nights...

(near to breakdown)

How was I to understand, how was I

to know what they were capable of?

No one knew. No one knew.

FURTWANGLER

I don't want to stay in this

country. Yes, I should have left

in 1934, it would have been better

if I'd left...

STEVE

Get him out of here.

FURTWANGLER

Thank you, Fraulein. You have been

most kind.

(he rises.)

He smiles at her. She is

embarrassed.

STEVE

(into the telephone)

Major Arnold. Get me General

Wallace. General? Major Arnold,

about Furtwangler. I don't know if

we've got a case that'll stand up,

but sure as hell we can give him a

hard time.

STEVE

(to David)

Hey, turn that down, would you?

Can't you see I'm on the phone?

(into the telephone)

Never mind, we got a journalist

who'll do whatever we tell him.

STEVE

Turn it off!

STEVE'S VOICE

We handed Wilhelm Furtwangler over

to the civil authorities and he

was charged with serving the Nazi

regime, with uttering anti-Semitic

slurs, performing at an official

Nazi Party function and with being

a Prussian Privy Councillor.  Dr.

Furtwangler was acquitted. I didn't

nail him. But I sure winged him.

And I know I did the right thing.

Furtwangler resumed his career but

he was never allowed to conduct in

the United States. He died in 1954.

Little K succeeded him as head of

the Berlin Philharmonic.
