"BIG FISH"

Written by

John August

Based on the novel by

Daniel Wallace

Final Production Draft

EDWARD (V.O.)

There are some fish that cannot be

caught. It's not that they're faster

or stronger than other fish. They're

just touched by something extra.

Call it luck. Call it grace. One

such fish was The Beast.

EDWARD (V.O.)

By the time I was born, he was already

a legend. He'd taken more hundred-

dollar lures than any fish in Alabama.

Some said that fish was the ghost of

Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned

in that river 60 years before. Others

claimed he was a lesser dinosaur,

left over from the Cretaceous period.

EDWARD

I didn't put any stock into such

speculation or superstition. All I

knew was I'd been trying to catch

that fish since I was a boy no bigger

than you.

(closer)

And on the day you were born, that

was the day I finally caught him.

EDWARD

Now, I'd tried everything on it:

worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut

butter-and-cheese. But on that day I

had a revelation: if that fish was

the ghost of a thief, the usual bait

wasn't going to work. I would have

to use something he truly desired.

LITTLE BRAVE

(confused)

Your finger?

EDWARD

Gold.

EDWARD

I tied my ring to the strongest line

they made -- strong enough to hold

up a bridge, they said, if just for

a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.

EDWARD (CONT'D)

The Beast jumped up and grabbed it

before the ring even hit the water.

And just as fast, he snapped clean

through that line.

EDWARD

You can see my predicament. My wedding

ring, the symbol of fidelity to my

wife, soon to be the mother of my

child, was now lost in the gut of an

uncatchable fish.

WILL

(low but insistent)

Make him stop.

WILL'S DATE

What did you do?

EDWARD

I followed that fish up-river and

down-river for three days and three

nights, until I finally had him boxed

in.

EDWARD

With these two hands, I reached in

and snatched that fish out of the

river. I looked him straight in the

eye. And I made a remarkable

discovery.

EDWARD

This fish, the Beast. The whole time

we were calling it a him, when in

fact it was a her. It was fat with

eggs, and was going to lay them any

day.

EDWARD

Now, I was in a situation. I could

gut that fish and get my ring back,

but doing so I would be killing the

smartest catfish in the Ashton River,

soon to be mother of a hundred others.

EDWARD

Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-

born son the chance to catch a fish

like this of his own? This lady fish

and I, well, we had the same destiny.

EDWARD AND WILL

We were part of the same equation.

SANDRA

Honey, it's still your night.

EDWARD

Now, you may well ask, since this

lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief,

why did it strike so quick on gold

when nothing else would attract it?

(closer; he holds up

his ring)

That was the lesson I learned that

day, the day my son was born.

EDWARD

Sometimes, the only way to catch an

uncatchable woman is to offer her a

wedding ring.

EDWARD

What, a father's not allowed to talk

about his son?

WILL

(disbelieving)

I am a footnote in that story. I am

the context for your great adventure.

Which never happened! Incidentally!

You were selling novelty products in

Wichita the day I was born.

EDWARD

(shaking his head)

Jesus Christ.

WILL

Friend of yours? Did you help him

out of a bind?

EDWARD

Come on, Will. Everyone likes that

story.

WILL

No Dad, they don't. I do not like

the story. Not anymore, not after a

thousand times. I know all the

punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as

well as you can.

(closer)

For one night, one night in your

entire life, the universe does not

revolve around Edward Bloom. It

revolves around me and my wife. How

can you not understand that?

EDWARD

(low)

Sorry to embarrass you.

WILL

You're embarrassing yourself, Dad.

You just don't see it.

WILL (V.O.)

After that night, I didn't speak to

my father again for three years.

WILL (ON PHONE)

(without pauses)

William Bloom with the Associated

Press if I could just...

WILL (V.O.)

We communicated indirectly I guess.

In her letters and Christmas cards,

my mother would write for both of

them.

WILL (V.O.)

When I'd call, Mom would say that

Dad was out driving. Or swimming in

the pool.

WILL

True to form, we never talked about

our not talking.

WILL (V.O.)

The truth is, I didn't see anything

of myself in my father, and I don't

think he saw anything of himself in

me. We were like strangers who knew

each other very well.

WILL (V.O.)

In telling the story of my father's

life, it's impossible to separate

the fact from the fiction, the man

from the myth. The best I can do is

to tell it the way he told me.

WILL (V.O.)

It doesn't always make sense, and

most of it never happened.

WILL (V.O.)

But that's what kind of story this

is.

BIG FISH

YOUNG DR. BENNETT

Now, Mrs. Bloom, I'll need you to

give me one good push. On three.

One...

YOUNG DR. BENNETT

Grab that baby!

WILL (V.O.)

My father's birth would set the pace

for his unlikely life. No longer

than most men's, but larger. And as

strange as his stories got, the

endings were always the most

surprising of all.

JOSEPHINE

Allo oui?

JOSEPHINE

(on phone)

Yes, he's here.

JOSEPHINE

It's your mother.

WILL

(on phone)

Hi. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

WILL (CONT'D)

What does Dr. Bennett say? Okay. No,

sure, let me talk to him. I'll wait.

JOSEPHINE

It's bad.

WILL

It's more than they thought. They're

going to stop chemo.

JOSEPHINE

You need to go.

WILL

Probably tonight.

JOSEPHINE

I'm going with you.

WILL

You don't have to.

JOSEPHINE

(a simple fact)

I'm going with you.

EDWARD (O.S., PRELAP)

So which one's it gonna be? The Monkey

in the Barn, the Dog in the Road?

MATCH CUT TO:

WILL

The one about the witch.

EDWARD

Your mom says I can't tell you that

one anymore. You get nightmares.

WILL

I'm not scared.

EDWARD

Neither was I. At first.

EDWARD

This all happened in the swamp outside

of Ashton. Kids weren't supposed to

go out in the swamp, on account of

the snakes and spiders and quicksand

that would swallow you up before you

could even scream. But there were

five of us out there that night: Me,

Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price

Brothers, Don and Zacky.

EDWARD

Not a one of us knew what was in

store.

COME TO:

EDWARD

Zacky, turn your flashlight on!

ZACKY

I don't got any batteries!

DON PRICE

Then why'd you bring it?

ZACKY

I don't want to be in the swamp with

a witch and no flashlight.

EDWARD

Is it true she got a glass eye?

WILBUR FREELY

I heard she got it from Gypsies.

EDWARD

What's a Gypsy?

ZACKY

Your momma's a Gypsy.

DON PRICE

Your momma's a bitch.

RUTHIE

You shouldn't swear. There's ladies

present.

DON PRICE

Shit.

ZACKY

Damn.

WILBUR FREELY

Screw.

EDWARD

(whispering)

Turn off your flashlights! She'll

see 'em.

ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)

Now, it's common knowledge that most

towns of a certain size have a witch,

if only to eat misbehaving children

and the occasional puppy who wanders

into her yard. Witches use those

bones to cast spells and curses that

make the land infertile.

ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)

Yet of the all the witches in Alabama,

there was one who was the most feared.

For she had one glass eye, which was

said to contain mystical powers.

WILBUR FREELY

I hear if you look right at it, you

can see how you're gonna die.

EDWARD

That's bull-s-h-i-t, that is. She's

not even a real witch.

DON PRICE

You're so sure, why don't you go in

and get that eye? I heard she keeps

it in a box on her nighttable.

DON PRICE

Or are you too scared?

EDWARD

I'll go in right now and get that

eye.

DON PRICE

Then do it.

EDWARD

Fine, I will.

DON PRICE

Fine, you do it.

EDWARD

Fine, I'm doing it.

RUTHIE

Edward, don't!

WILBUR FREELY

She'll make soap out of you!

(to Ruthie)

That's what she does, she makes soap

out of people.

EDWARD

(calm and

straightforward)

Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom, and

there's some folks'd like to see

your eye.

DON PRICE

You get the eye?

EDWARD

I brought it.

DON PRICE

(dubious)

Let's see it.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ZACKY

I saw how I was gonna die. I was

old, and I fell.

DON PRICE

I wasn't old at all.

EDWARD

I was thinking about death and all.

About seeing how you're gonna die.

EDWARD

I mean, on one hand, if dying was

all you thought about, it could kind

of screw you up. But it could kind

of help you, couldn't it? Because

you'd know that everything else you

can survive.

EDWARD

I guess I'm saying, I'd like to know.

EDWARD

Huh. That's how I go?

ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)

From that moment on, I no longer

feared death. And for that, I was as

good as immortal.

MATCH CUT TO:

SANDRA

How did you get here?

WILL

We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that

big really.

SANDRA

Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up

at the airport.

WILL

We rented a car.

SANDRA

(simply)

You didn't need to do that. You just

didn't.

WILL

Hi, Mom.

SANDRA

I'm so glad you're here.

SANDRA

You shouldn't have flown. But...

JOSEPHINE

It's good to see you. You look

beautiful.

SANDRA

Thank you. I'll bet you need to --

JOSEPHINE

Yes.

SANDRA

Down the hall on the right. The door

sticks. You have to really pull it.

WILL

Is that Dr. Bennett's car?

SANDRA

He's up with your father.

WILL

How is he?

SANDRA

He's impossible. He won't eat. And

because he won't eat, he gets weaker.

And because he's weaker, he doesn't

want to eat.

WILL

How much time does he have left?

SANDRA

You don't talk about those things.

Not yet.

DR. BENNETT

Will.

WILL

Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.

(they shake)

My wife, Josephine.

DR. BENNETT

A pleasure.

DR. BENNETT

You're seven months.

JOSEPHINE

(impressed)

To the day.

DR. BENNETT

It's a boy.

SANDRA

You don't think he looks any worse.

DR. BENNETT

No. I would say he's the same.

WILL

Can I see him?

DR. BENNETT

Absolutely. Be good for you to talk

to him.

SANDRA

Get him to drink one of these. He

won't, but tell him he has to.

WILL

Dad?

EDWARD

You --

(he points)

-- are in for a surprise.

WILL

Am I?

EDWARD

Having a kid changes everything. I

mean, there's the diapers and the

burping and the midnight feedings...

WILL

Did you do any of that?

EDWARD

No, but I hear it's terrible. Then

you spend years trying to corrupt

and mislead this child, fill its

head with nonsense and still it turns

out perfectly fine.

WILL

You think I'm up for it?

EDWARD

You learned from the best.

WILL

Just drink half the can. I'll tell

her you drank the whole thing.

Everyone wins.

EDWARD

People needn't worry so much. It's

not my time yet. This isn't how I

go.

WILL

Really.

EDWARD

Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

WILL

The Old Lady by the swamp.

EDWARD

She was a witch.

WILL

No, she was old and probably senile.

Maybe schizophrenic.

EDWARD

I saw my death in that eye. And this

is not how it happens.

WILL

So how does it happen?

EDWARD

Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to

ruin it for you.

EDWARD

There was this panhandler who used

to stop me every morning when I came

out of this coffee shop near the

office.

WILL

Okay.

EDWARD

And every day I gave him a quarter.

Every day. Then I got sick and was

out for a couple of weeks. And when

I went back there, you know what he

said?

WILL

What did he say?

EDWARD

You owe me three-fifty.

WILL

Really.

EDWARD

True story.

WILL

When did you ever work in an office?

EDWARD

There's a lot you don't know about

me.

WILL

You're right.

EDWARD

Your mother was worried we wouldn't

talk again. And look at us. We're

talking fine. We're storytellers,

both of us. I speak mine out, you

write yours down. Same thing.

WILL

Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about

some things while I'm here.

EDWARD

You mean, while I'm here.

WILL

I'd just like to know the true

versions of things. Events. Stories.

You.

EDWARD

Your mother hasn't been keeping up

the pool. If you wanted to you

could...

WILL

I will.

EDWARD

You know where the chemicals are?

WILL

I used to do it when you were gone,

remember? I used to do it a lot.

EDWARD

I was never much for being at home,

Will. It's too confining. And this,

here. Being stuck in bed. Dying is

the worst thing that ever happened

to me.

WILL

I thought you weren't dying.

EDWARD

I said this isn't how I go. The last

part is much more unusual. Trust me

on that.

YOUNG WILL

Dr. Bennett says I'm going to have

to be home for a week.

EDWARD

That's nothing. I once had to stay

in bed for three years.

YOUNG WILL

Did you have chicken pox?

EDWARD

I wish.

CUT TO:

EDWARD (V.O.)

Truth is, no one quite knew what was

wrong. Most times, a person grows up

gradually. I found myself in a hurry.

EDWARD (V.O.)

My muscles couldn't keep up with my

bones, and my bones couldn't keep up

with my body's ambition. So I spent

the better part of three years

confined to my bed, with the World

Book Encyclopedia being my only means

of exploration. I had made it all

the way to the "G's," hoping to find

an answer to my gigantificationism,

when I uncovered an article about

the common goldfish.

YOUNG EDWARD

(reading)

"Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish

will remain small. With more space,

the fish can grow double, triple, or

quadruple its size."

EDWARD (V.O.)

It occurred to me then, that perhaps

the reason for my growth was that I

was intended for larger things. After

all, a giant man can't have an

ordinary-sized life.

EDWARD (V.O.)

As soon as my bones had settled in

their adult configuration, I set

upon my plan to make a bigger place

for myself in Ashton.

GIRL

Edward Bloom!

EDWARD (V.O.)

I was the biggest thing Ashton had

ever seen. Until one day, a stranger

arrived.

SHARECROPPER

He ate an entire cornfield!

LITTLE GIRL

He ate my dog!

HOT-BLOODED SHOTGUN TOTER

If you ain't gonna stop him Mayor,

we will!

MAYOR

I won't have mob violence in this

town. Now, has someone tried talking

to him?

SOME FARMER

You can't reason with 'im!

SHEPHARD

He's a monster!

A VOICE (O.S.)

I'll do it.

EDWARD

I'll talk to him. See if I can get

him to move on.

MAYOR

Son, that creature could crush you

without trying.

EDWARD

Trust me, he'll have to try.

EDWARD

Hello!

EDWARD

My name is Edward Bloom! I want to

talk to you!

VOICE (O.S.)

GO AWAY!

EDWARD

I'm not going anywhere until you

show yourself.

EDWARD (V.O.)

Armed with the foreknowledge of my

own death, I knew the giant couldn't

kill me. All the same, I preferred

to keep my bones unbroken.

KARL

Why are you here?

EDWARD

So you can eat me. The town decided

to send a human sacrifice, and I

volunteered.

EDWARD

My arms are a little stringy, but

there's some good eating on my legs.

I mean, I'd be tempted to eat them

myself.

(beat)

So I guess, just, if you could get

it over with quick. Because I'm not

much for pain, really.

EDWARD

Look, I can't go back. I'm a human

sacrifice. If I go back, everyone

will think I'm a coward. And I'd

rather be dinner than a coward.

EDWARD

Here, start with my hand. It'll be

an appetizer.

KARL

I don't want to eat you. I don't

want to eat anybody. It's just I get

so hungry. I'm too big.

EDWARD

Did you ever think maybe you're not

too big? Maybe this town's just too

small. I mean, look at it.

EDWARD

Hardly two stories in the whole place.

Now I've heard in real cities, they've

got buildings so tall you can't even

see the tops of 'em.

KARL

Really?

EDWARD

Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got

all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat

a lot, can't you?

KARL

I can.

EDWARD

So why are you wasting your time in

a small town? You're a big man. You

should be in the big city.

KARL

You're just trying to get me to leave,

aren't you? That's why they sent you

here.

EDWARD

What's your name, Giant?

KARL

Karl.

EDWARD

Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do

want you to leave, Karl. But I want

to leave with you.

(closer)

You think this town is too small for

you, well, it's too small for a man

of my ambition. I can't see staying

here a day longer.

KARL

You don't like it?

EDWARD

I love every square inch of it. But

I can feel the edges closing in on

me. A man's life can only grow to a

certain size in a place like this.

(beat)

So what do you say? Join me?

KARL

Okay.

EDWARD

Okay.

EDWARD

Now first, we gotta get you ready

for the city.

MAYOR

(loudly, for the crowd)

Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton,

it's with a heavy heart we see you

go. But take with you this Key to

the City, and know that any time you

want to come back, all our doors are

open to you.

EDWARD (V.O.)

That afternoon as I left Ashton,

everyone seemed to have advice.

VARIOUS TOWNFOLK

Find yourself a nice girl! Don't

trust anyone in Kentucky! Watch your

pride, Edward Bloom!

EDWARD (V.O.)

But there was one person whose counsel

I held above all others.

EDWARD (V.O.)

She said that the biggest fish in

the river gets that way by never

being caught.

EDWARD

(to the Old Woman)

Okay. Thanks.

KARL

What did she say?

EDWARD

Beats me.

EDWARD (V.O.)

There were two roads out of Ashton,

a new one which was paved, and an

older one that wasn't. People didn't

use the old road anymore, and it had

developed the reputation of being

haunted.

EDWARD (V.O.)

Since I had no intention of ever

returning to Ashton, this seemed as

good a time as any to find out what

lay down that old road.

KARL

You know anyone's who's taken it?

EDWARD

That poet, Norther Winslow did. He

was going to Paris, France. He must

have liked it, because no one ever

heard from him again.

(beat)

Tell you what. You take the other

way and I'll cut through here. Meet

you on the far side.

KARL

You're not trying to run away?

EDWARD

Just to be sure, you can take my

pack.

EDWARD

You stupid sonofa...

WARNING!

JUMPING SPIDERS!

EDWARD (V.O.)

There comes a point where a reasonable

man will swallow his pride and admit

he's made a terrible mistake. The

truth is, I was never a reasonable

man.

EDWARD

And what I recalled of Sunday School

was that the more difficult something

became, the more rewarding it was in

the end.

MAN'S VOICE

Friend!

BEAMEN

Welcome to ya. What's your name?

EDWARD

Edward Bloom.

BEAMEN

Bloom like a flower?

EDWARD

Yes.

BEAMEN

Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom.

We weren't expecting you yet.

EDWARD

You were expecting me?

BEAMEN

Not yet.

MILDRED

You must have taken a shortcut.

EDWARD

I did. It nearly killed me.

BEAMEN

Mmm-hmm. Life'll do that to you. And

truthfully, the long way is easier,

but it's longer.

MILDRED

Much longer.

BEAMEN

And you're here now, and that's what

matters.

EDWARD

What is this place?

BEAMEN

The town of Spectre. Best kept secret

in Alabama. Says here you're from

Ashton, right? Last person we had

from Ashton was Norther Winslow.

EDWARD

The poet? What ever happened to him?

BEAMEN

He's still here. Let me buy you a

drink. I'll tell you all about it.

Hell, I'll have him tell you.

EDWARD

No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm

already running late.

BEAMEN

Son, I already told you. You're early.

BEAMEN

Now tell me if that isn't the best

pie you ever ate.

EDWARD

It truly is.

NORTHER WINSLOW

Everything here tastes better. Even

the water is sweet. Never gets too

hot, too cold, too humid. At night

the wind goes through the trees and

you'd swear there was a whole symphony

out there, playing just for you.

EDWARD

Hey!

EDWARD

Wait! I need those!

NORTHER WINSLOW

There is no softer ground than town.

MILDRED

That rhymes!

BEAMEN

He is our poet laureate.

EDWARD (V.O.)

Sometimes in a dream, you'll visit

places that seem instantly familiar,

filled with friends you've never

met.

EDWARD (V.O.)

A man might travel his entire life

and never find a place so inviting.

My journey had scarcely begun, and I

had arrived.

NORTHER WINSLOW

I've been working on this poem for

12 years.

EDWARD

Really.

NORTHER WINSLOW

There's a lot of expectation. I don't

want to disappoint my fans.

EDWARD

It's only three lines long.

NORTHER WINSLOW

This is why you don't show work in

progress.

EDWARD

Norther, do you ever regret not making

it to Paris?

NORTHER WINSLOW

I can't imagine any place better

than here.

EDWARD

You're a poet. You oughta be able

to. And maybe if you'd seen more,

you could.

EDWARD

No, it's okay! I got it. I got the

snake.

EDWARD

Wait! I'm sorry. Hello?!

A GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

There's leeches in there!

EDWARD

Did you see that woman?

JENNY

What did she look like?

EDWARD

Well, she... uh...

JENNY

Was she nekkid?

EDWARD

Yeah.

JENNY

(matter-of-fact)

It's not a woman, it's a fish. No

one ever catches her.

JENNY (CONT'D)

Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent

people. My daddy said it looked like

the coon dog he had when he was kid,

back from the dead.

EDWARD

Shoot.

JENNY

How old are you?

EDWARD

Eighteen.

JENNY

I'm eight. That means when I'm

eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm

28, you'll only be 38.

EDWARD

(a little wary)

You're pretty good at arithmetic.

JENNY

And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And

that's not much difference at all.

EDWARD

Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

MILDRED

Jenny thinks you're quite a catch.

We all do.

EDWARD

(not hearing)

What?

MILDRED

I said you're quite a catch!

EDWARD

I have to leave. Tonight.

BEAMEN

Why?

EDWARD

This town is everything a man could

ask for. And if I were to end up

here, I'd consider myself lucky. But

the fact is, I'm not ready to end up

anywhere.

BEAMEN

No one's ever left.

JENNY

How are you gonna make it without

your shoes?

EDWARD

I suspect it will hurt a lot.

BEAMEN

(calling after him)

You won't find a better place!

EDWARD

I don't expect to.

JENNY

Promise me you'll come back.

EDWARD

I promise. Someday. When I'm really

supposed to.

EDWARD (V.O.)

As difficult as it was to reach

Spectre, I was fated to get there

eventually. After all, no man can

avoid reaching the end of his life.

EDWARD

And then I realized, this wasn't the

end of my life.

EDWARD

(aloud)

This isn't how I die.

A DEEP VOICE

Friend!

KARL

What happened to your shoes?

EDWARD

They got ahead of me.

CROSSFADE TO:

WILL

I don't know if you've seen it, but

Josephine has some photos in the

most recent Newsweek.

SANDRA

Really! That's wonderful.

JOSEPHINE

I spent a week in Morocco for the

story. It was incredible.

SANDRA

We'll have to pick up a copy.

EDWARD

I don't know if you're aware of this,

Josephine, but African parrots, in

their native home of the Congo --

they speak only French.

JOSEPHINE

(amused)

Really.

EDWARD

You're lucky to get four words out

of them in English. But if you were

to walk through the jungle, you'd

hear them speaking the most elaborate

French. Those parrots talk about

everything: politics, movies, fashion --

everything but religion.

WILL

Why not religion, Dad?

EDWARD

It's rude to talk about religion.

You never know who you're going to

offend.

WILL

Josephine actually went to the Congo

last year.

EDWARD

Oh, so you know.

WILL

Mom, would you say you understand

Dad?

SANDRA

Of course.

WILL

What I mean is, do you really know

what's going on in his head?

SANDRA

Yes.

WILL

How is that possible? I mean, you

try to ask him a question and suddenly

it's another one of his stories.

(decidedly)

You can't honestly say you know him.

SANDRA

Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume

things you don't know.

SANDRA

Would you say you understand

Josephine?

WILL

Yes. But that's a different...

SANDRA

No it's not. It's exactly the same.

Your father and I met, we dated, and

we married -- we chose each other --

because we understood each other on

some fundamental level. Just the

same as you two.

WILL

Josephine and I have a lot in common.

SANDRA

Yes, you both think William Bloom is

a very smart man.

(beat)

The problem is, you only see me as

your mother, and not as someone's

wife. And I've been his wife longer

than I've been your mother. You can't

discount that.

WILL

True. But I've known him my whole

life, and I don't feel like I know

him at all. Or ever will.

SANDRA

I know it's not easy. Just remember,

he didn't choose to be your father

and you didn't choose to be his son.

You just ended up together. You could

pick numbers out of a dark bag and

it'd be just the same. If you ask

me, it's a wonder parents and children

can stand each other at all.

WILL

But I understand you, Mom. I always

have.

SANDRA

Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not

the mystery you're trying to solve

right now.

SANDRA

Before I forget, your father has

papers in the basement I'd like you

to go through. I wouldn't know what's

important.

WILL

(distracted)

Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde

hair.

SANDRA

(no idea)

Was she one of your teachers?

WILL

No. But it's weird. She seemed to

recognize me.

SANDRA

(to the cashier)

Do you know who that is?

CASHIER

Never seen her before. Pretty, though.

EDWARD

(playfully lecherous)

Hello.

JOSEPHINE

Hi. How are you feeling?

EDWARD

I was dreaming.

JOSEPHINE

What were you dreaming about?

EDWARD

I don't usually remember unless

they're especially portentous. You

know what that word means, portentous?

EDWARD

Means when you dream about something

that's going to happen.

(beat, gathering)

Like one night, I had a dream where

this crow came and told me, "Your

Aunt is going to die." I was so scared

I woke up my parents. They told me

it was just a dream, to go back to

bed. But the next morning, my Aunt

Stacy was dead.

JOSEPHINE

That's terrible.

EDWARD

Terrible for her, but think about

me, young boy with that kind of power.

Wasn't three weeks later that the

crow came back to me in a dream and

said, "Your Grampa is going to die."

Well, I ran right back to my parents.

My father said, no, Gramps is fine,

but I could see there was trepidation.

And true enough, that next morning

my Grampa was dead.

EDWARD

For the next couple weeks, I didn't

have another dream. Until one night

the crow came back and said, "Your

Daddy is going to die."

(beat)

Well, I didn't know what to do. But

finally I told my father. And he

said not to worry, but I could tell

he was rattled. That next day, he

wasn't himself, always looking around,

waiting for something to drop on his

head. Because the crow didn't tell

how it was going to happen, just

those words: your Daddy is going to

die. Well, he went into town early

and was gone for a long time. And

when he finally came back, he looked

terrible, like he was waiting for

the axe to fall all day. He said to

my mother, "Good God. I just had the

worst day of my life."

(beat)

"You think you've had a bad day,"

she said. "This morning the milkman

dropped dead on the porch!" Josephine

smiles, a half-laugh, which gets him

smiling too.

EDWARD

Because see, my mother was banging

the milkman.

JOSEPHINE

No, I understand.

EDWARD

He was slipping her a little extra

cream.

EDWARD

He was filling her basket. He was

making deliveries around back.

EDWARD

He was buttering her rolls. Pumping

her churn. Splashing milk in her

box.

JOSEPHINE

Stop.

EDWARD

They were squeezing the cheese.

Clanking the bottles. Licking the

popsicle.

EDWARD

Cracking the eggs and making an

omelet.

EDWARD

Spooning the sherbet.

JOSEPHINE

(interrupting)

Can I take your picture?

EDWARD

You don't need a picture. Just look

up handsome in the dictionary.

JOSEPHINE

Please?

JOSEPHINE (O.S.)

I have photos from the wedding to

show you. There's a great one of you

and my father. I had an extra print

made.

JOSEPHINE

I want to see pictures of your

wedding. I've never seen any.

EDWARD

That's because we didn't have a

wedding. Your mother-in-law was never

supposed to marry me. She was engaged

to somebody else.

JOSEPHINE

(loading film)

I never knew.

EDWARD

Will never told you that?

(she shakes her head)

Probably just as well. He would have

told it all wrong anyway. All the

facts and none of the flavor.

JOSEPHINE

Oh, so this is a tall tale?

EDWARD

Well, it's not a short one.

MATCH CUT TO:

EDWARD (V.O.)

I had just left Ashton, and was on

my way to discover my destiny. Not

knowing what that would be exactly,

I explored every opportunity that

presented itself.

AMOS

Ladies and Gentlemen, you may think

you've seen the unusual. You may

think you've seen the bizarre. But

I've travelled to the five corners

of the world, and let me tell you,

I've never seen anything like this.

AMOS

When I found this man, he was picking

oranges in Florida. His fellow workers

called him El Penumbra -- The Shadow --

because when you were working beside

him, he blocked out the daylight. He

could take a whole tree in his hands

and shake off the fruit. I had to

pay his crew boss $10,000 just so I

could take him with me.

AMOS

Not to alarm you, Ma'am. But if this

man wanted to, he could crush your

head between his toes.

(she trembles)

But he won't.

(a long beat)

He's not going to hurt her, folks,

because he's our own Gentle Giant.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you

Colossus!

CUT TO:

AMOS

What's his name? Does he talk? It's

not important.

KARL

Karl.

AMOS

Tell me Karl, have you ever heard of

the term "involuntary servitude?"

AMOS

"Unconscionable contract?"

AMOS

Great, great. That's fantastic.

EDWARD (V.O.)

It was on that night Karl met his

destiny. And I met mine. Almost.

EDWARD (V.O.)

They say when you meet the love of

your life, time stops. And that's

true. What they don't tell you, is

that once time starts again, it moves

extra fast to catch up.

CROSSFADE TO:

AMOS

Hey kid! Your friend just made himself

a star.

EDWARD

That's great.

(INTRODUCING)

My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.

EDWARD

Good to meet you.

AMOS

What's the matter with you, kid? I

haven't seen a customer so depressed

since the elephant sat on that

farmer's wife.

(beat)

Get it? "Depressed?"

AMOS

See! The big guy likes it.

EDWARD

I just saw the woman I'm going to

marry, I know it. But then I lost

her.

AMOS

Tough break. Most men have to get

married before they lose their wives.

EDWARD

(with absolute

conviction)

I'm going to spend the rest of my

life looking for her. That or die

alone.

AMOS

Jesus, kid.

(realizing)

Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde

hair, blue hat?

EDWARD

Yes!

AMOS

I know her uncle. Friends of the

family.

EDWARD

Who is she? Where does she live?

AMOS

Kid. Don't waste your time. She's

out of your league.

EDWARD

What do you mean? You don't even

know me.

AMOS

Sure I do. You were hot shit back in

Hickville, but here in the real world,

you got squat. You don't have a plan.

You don't have a job. You don't have

anything but the clothes on your

back.

EDWARD

I've got a whole backpack full of

clothes!

EDWARD

(realizing)

Someone stole my backpack.

AMOS

Kid, you were a big fish in a small

pond. This here is the ocean, and

you're drowning. Take my advice and

go back to Puddleville. You'll be

happy there.

EDWARD

Wait. You said I don't have a plan.

I do. I'm going to find that girl

and marry her and spend the rest of

my life with her.

EDWARD

I don't have a job, but I would have

a job if you gave me one. And I may

not have much, but I have more

determination than any man you're

ever going to meet.

AMOS

Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.

EDWARD

I'll work night and day, and you

won't have to pay me. You just have

to tell me who she is.

AMOS

Every month you work for me, I'll

tell you one thing about her. That's

my final offer.

EDWARD (V.O.)

From that moment on, I did everything

Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of

things he didn't. I'd go three days

without stopping to eat, and four

days without sleeping.

EDWARD (V.O.)

The only thing that kept me going

was the promise of meeting the girl

who would be my wife.

EDWARD

Mr. Calloway! It's been a month today.

AMOS

This girl, the love of your life.

Her favorite flower is daffodils.

EDWARD

Daffodils.

(to Karl)

Daffodils!

EDWARD

(to himself)

Daffodils!

EDWARD (V.O.)

True to his word, every month Amos

would tell me something new about

the woman of my dreams.

EDWARD

College! She's going to college!

EDWARD

(to himself)

Music! She likes music. I like music

too!

EDWARD (V.O.)

Over the months, I learned a lot

about the woman I was going to marry,

but not her name, and not where to

find her.

EDWARD

Mr. Calloway! It's Edward Bloom. I

need to talk to you.

EDWARD

No, wait!

EDWARD

It was that night I discovered that

most things you consider evil or

wicked are simply lonely, and lacking

in the social niceties.

TRANSITION TO:

AMOS

Didn't kill anything, did I?

EDWARD

A few rabbits, but I think one of

them was already dead.

AMOS

That would explain the indigestion.

AMOS

I was wrong about you kid. You may

not have much, but what you got, you

got a lot of. You could get any girl.

EDWARD

There's only one I want.

AMOS

Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's

going to Auburn. The semester's almost

over, so you better hurry.

EDWARD

Thank you.

AMOS

Good luck, kid.

EDWARD (V.O.)

After saying my goodbyes, I hopped

three trains to get to Auburn that

afternoon.

EDWARD

You don't know me, but my name is

Edward Bloom and I am in love with

you. I've spent the last three years

working to find out who you are.

I've been shot and stabbed and

trampled a few times, had my ribs

broken twice, but it's all worth it

to see you here, now, and to finally

get to talk to you. Because I am

destined to marry you. I knew that

from the first moment I saw you at

the circus. And I know it now more

than ever.

SANDRA

I'm sorry.

EDWARD

Don't need to apologize to me. I

mean, I'm the luckiest person you're

going to find today...

SANDRA

No I'm sorry, I... I'm engaged to be

married.

EDWARD

Oh.

SANDRA

But you're wrong. I do know you, at

least by reputation. Edward Bloom

from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged

to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He

was a few years older than you.

FLASHCUTS TO:

BACK TO:

EDWARD

Well. Congratulations. I'm sorry to

have bothered you.

SANDRA

Stop it. It's not funny. That poor

boy.

EDWARD (V.O.)

Fate has a cruel way of circling

around on you. After all this work

to leave Ashton, the girl I loved

was now engaged to one of its biggest

jerks.

EDWARD (V.O.)

There's a time when a man needs to

fight, and a time when he needs to

accept that his destiny is lost,

that the ship has sailed, and that

only a fool would continue.

EDWARD (V.O.)

The truth is, I've always been a

fool.

EDWARD

Sandra Templeton! I love you! And I

am going to marry you!

SANDRA

Daffodils?

EDWARD

They're your favorite flower.

SANDRA

How did you get so many?

EDWARD

I called everywhere in five states

and explained this was the only way

I could get my wife to marry me.

SANDRA

You don't even know me.

EDWARD

I have the rest of my life to find

out.

A MAN'S VOICE

Sandra!

SANDRA

It's Don. Promise me you won't hurt

him.

EDWARD

If that's what you want, I swear to

it.

DON PRICE

Bloom!

EDWARD

Don.

DON PRICE

What the hell are you doing? This is

my girl. Mine!

EDWARD

I didn't know she belonged to anybody.

SANDRA

Stop it!

DON PRICE

(ignoring)

What the matter, Bloom? Too scared

to fight back?

EDWARD

I promised I wouldn't.

EDWARD (V.O.)

While I took the beating of a

lifetime, it was Don Price who was

ultimately defeated.

INTERCUT WITH:

EDWARD (V.O.)

All the physical activity had worsened

a congenital valve defect. Put simply,

his heart wasn't strong enough.

MATCH CUT TO:

RETURNING BACK TO:

SANDRA

Don!

SANDRA

I will never marry you.

DON PRICE

What. You love this guy?

SANDRA

He's almost a stranger and I prefer

him to you.

SANDRA

How can I convince you to stop?

EDWARD

Go out with me.

SANDRA

Okay.

EDWARD (V.O.)

As it turned out, Sandra was able to

keep her same date at the chapel.

Only the groom had changed.

CUT TO:

JOSEPHINE

I thought you said you didn't have a

church wedding.

EDWARD

Well, we were all set to, but there

was a complication.

CUT TO:

JOSEPHINE (O.S.)

Is it the medicine that's making you

thirsty?

EDWARD (O.S.)

Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole

life. Never really known why.

EDWARD

There was one time when I was

eleven...

JOSEPHINE

(gently)

You were talking about your wedding.

EDWARD

I didn't forget. I was just working

on a tangent. See, most men, they'll

tell a story straight through, and

it won't be complicated, but it won't

be interesting either.

JOSEPHINE

I like your stories.

EDWARD

And I like you.

EDWARD

Now. The thing about working for a

circus is you don't have a regular

address, and after three years I had

a lot of undelivered mail.

EDWARD

During the four weeks I was in the

hospital, the postmaster finally

caught up with me.

EDWARD (V.O.)

It turned out that while my heart

belonged to Sandra, the rest of my

body belonged to the U.S. Government.

EDWARD (V.O.)

A hitch in the Army was up to three

years at that point, and having waited

three years just to meet Sandra, I

knew I couldn't survive being away

from her that long. So I took every

hazardous assignment I could find,

with the hope of getting my time

down to less than a year.

JUMP LEADER

GO! GO! GO!

PING

Sometimes a girl can feel so alone

Without a lover to call her own.

Sometimes it's so bad, she wants to

explode.

Wants to grab the first man she sees

and tear off his clothes.

PING (CONT'D)

But she won't.

No, she can't.

She needs a special special different

unusual man.

Because that girl,

Who looks like me,

She has wants, but she has needs.

PING

(speaking)

Any of you got needs?

PING

(chorus)

I've had twice the adventure,

Cried double the tears.

Two times the bad times in half the

years.

I need a strong man, because I've

got

Twice the love to give.

PING

Say hello, Jing.

JING

Hello Jing.

PING

(to the crowd)

I'm Ping. She's Jing. She's the good

one.

(closer)

I'm the bad one.

PING

How could you miss your cue? You

make me look like a fool, out there

alone.

JING

You weren't alone.

PING

Who the hell are you?

EDWARD

(in Chinese)

I'm not going to hurt you.

PING

Damn right you're not.

(yelling)

GUARD!

JING

Tell your men not to bother us! And

lock that door!

EDWARD

Please, I need your help.

PING

What makes you think we'll help you?

CROSSFADE TO:

EDWARD (V.O.)

Over the next hour, I described my

love for Sandra Kay Templeton, and

the ordeal that brought me before

them. As it had always been, this

love was my salvation. It was destined

to be.

EDWARD (V.O.)

We put together an elaborate plan

for escape, involving a whaling ship

to Russia, a barge to Cuba and a

small, dirty canoe to Miami. We all

knew it would be dangerous.

PING

And what are we supposed to do when

we get to America?

EDWARD

I can get you bookings. I know the

biggest man in show business.

JING

Bob Hope?

EDWARD

Bigger.

TRANSITION TO:

EDWARD (V.O.)

And so the twins and I began our

arduous journey halfway around the

world. Unfortunately, there was no

way to send a message back to America.

EDWARD (V.O.)

And so it was no surprise that the

Army believed I was dead.

EDWARD (V.O.)

After four months, Sandra had gotten

over the worst of the nightmares.

When the phone rang, she didn't think

it was somehow me calling her. When

a car drove past, she didn't get up

to check out the window.

CROSSFADE TO:

JOSEPHINE

I talked with your father last night.

WILL

Did you?

JOSEPHINE

You never told me how your parents

met.

WILL

They met at Auburn.

JOSEPHINE

What about the details? How they

fell in love. The Circus. The War.

You never told me any of that.

WILL

That's because most of it never

happened.

JOSEPHINE

But it's romantic.

WILL

(non-committal)

Mmm.

JOSEPHINE

Mmm, what?

WILL

Mmm, what. I know better than to

argue romance with a French woman.

JOSEPHINE

Do you love your father?

WILL

Everyone loves my father. He's a

very likeable guy.

JOSEPHINE

(repeating)

Do you love him?

WILL

You have to understand. When I was

growing up, he was gone more than he

was here. And I started thinking --

maybe he has a second life somewhere

else. With another house, another

family. He leaves us, he goes to

them. Or maybe there is no family.

Maybe he never wanted a family. But

whatever it is, maybe he likes that

second life better. And the reason

he tells all those stories is because

he can't stand this boring place.

JOSEPHINE

But it's not true.

WILL

What is "true?" I've never heard my

father say a single true thing.

WILL

Look, I know why you like him. I

know why everyone likes him. But I

need you to tell me I'm not crazy.

JOSEPHINE

You're not.

WILL

I need you on my side.

JOSEPHINE

I am always on your side. And I think

you should talk to him.

EDWARD

Did I ever tell you about how...

WILL

(interrupting)

Yes.

WILL

The maple tree and the Buick. We

heard it.

EDWARD

(re: Josephine)

I think someone hasn't.

JOSEPHINE

The tree fell on the car, spilling

the syrup, which attracted the flies,

which got stuck to it and flew off

with the whole car.

EDWARD

(undeterred)

But the real story is how I got the

car. You see...

WILL

(interrupting)

Dad?

EDWARD

Son?

WILL

Can we talk?

SANDRA

I'm going to get started on dishes.

JOSEPHINE

I'll help you.

WILL

Do you know much about icebergs,

Dad?

EDWARD

Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They

were hauling it down to Texas for

drinking water, only they didn't

count on an elephant being frozen

inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.

WILL

(interrupting)

Dad!

EDWARD

What?

WILL

I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

EDWARD

Then you shouldn't have started with

a question. Because people want to

answer questions. You should have

started with, "The thing about

icebergs is..."

WILL

(frustrated)

The thing about icebergs is you only

see 10 percent of them. The other 90

percent is below the water where you

can't see it. And that's what it is

with you Dad. I'm only seeing this

little bit that sticks above the

water.

EDWARD

(joking)

What, you're seeing down to my nose?

My chin?

WILL

I have no idea who you are because

you have never told me a single fact.

EDWARD

I've told you a thousand facts. That's

all I do, Will. I tell stories.

WILL

You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing

lies. Stories are what you tell a

five-year old at bedtime. They're

not elaborate mythologies you maintain

when your son is ten and fifteen and

twenty and thirty. And the thing is,

I believed you. I believed your

stories so much longer than I should

have. And then when I realized that

everything you said was impossible --

everything! -- I felt like such a

fool to have trusted you. You were

like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny

combined. Just as charming and just

as fake.

EDWARD

You think I'm fake.

WILL

Only on the surface. But that's all

I've ever seen.

WILL

Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my

own here. It would kill me if he

went through his whole life never

understanding me.

EDWARD

It would kill you, huh?

EDWARD

What do you want, Will? Who do you

want me to be?

WILL

Yourself. Good, bad, everything.

Just show me who you are for once.

EDWARD

I have been nothing but myself since

the day I was born. And if you can't

see that, it's your failing, not

mine.

SANDRA

Your father decided he needed to

have an office, and it wouldn't do

to have it in the house. You'll know

better than me what's important.

WILL

What is it?

SANDRA

It was during the war. Your father

went missing. They thought he was

dead.

WILL

That really happened?

SANDRA

Not everything your father says is a

complete fabrication.

SANDRA

I'm going to check on him.

JOSEPHINE

I need to lie down for a bit.

WILL

Go.

EDWARD (V.O.)

After the war, the sons of Alabama

returned home, looking for work.

Each had an advantage over me. They

were alive, while I was -- officially --

deceased.

EDWARD (V.O.)

With my prospects few, I took a job

as a travelling salesman. It suited

me. If there's one thing you can say

about Edward Bloom, it's that I am a

social person.

EDWARD

I've travelled from Tennessee to

Timbuktu, and if there's one thing

people have in common, is we could

all use a hand around the house.

EDWARD

Why, with this product you can...

EDWARD

Open a jar. Open a letter. Scratch

yourself while wearing mittens. Hold

a book. Hold a baby. Hold the dog

away from kittens. It's strong enough,

you can do a handstand with no hands

at all.

EDWARD

You can use it to point out important

information. Or dangers. Or beautiful

women.

EDWARD

We're still working on that one.

EDWARD (V.O.)

Soon I added other products, and

other cities, until my territory

stretched from the coast to western

Texas.

EDWARD (V.O.)

I could be gone for weeks at a time.

But every other Friday, I'd put all

the money I'd made into an account

set aside for a proper house with a

white picket fence.

THE MAN

Edward? Edward Bloom?

NORTHER WINSLOW

It's me. Norther Winslow.

EDWARD (V.O.)

I was astonished to see the greatest

poet of both Ashton and Spectre all

the way out in Texas.

EDWARD

I don't believe it!

NORTHER WINSLOW

I want you to know, when you left

Spectre it opened my eyes. There was

a whole life out there that I was

not living. So I travelled. I saw

France, and Africa, half of South

America. Every day a new adventure,

that's my motto.

EDWARD

That's great, Norther. I'm happy for

you. I can't believe I helped.

EDWARD

So what are you up to now?

NORTHER WINSLOW

I'm robbing this place.

NORTHER WINSLOW

(to Edward)

Would you mind grabbing that?

NORTHER WINSLOW

(to the crowd)

Now, I want all of you to lie down.

I'm gonna be cleaning out the cash

drawers, and my associate here is

going to handle the vault.

(pointing to a Teller

Woman)

You help my friend, okay?

EDWARD

Look, I'm really sorry. I just don't

want anybody to get hurt.

TELLER WOMAN

It's not that, it's just...

TELLER WOMAN

...there's no money. We're completely

bankrupt.

EDWARD (V.O.)

It turned out the savings and loan

had already been robbed -- not by

armed bandits, but by speculators in

Texas real estate.

TELLER WOMAN

(dead serious)

You gotta promise you won't tell

anybody.

CUT TO:

NORTHER WINSLOW

Sixty. Eighty. Four hundred dollars!

Not bad for just the drawers. Let's

see what you got from the vault.

NORTHER WINSLOW

This is it? The whole vault.

EDWARD

'Fraid so.

NORTHER WINSLOW

Edward, it's got your deposit slip

on it.

EDWARD

Look, I just didn't want you to go

empty-handed. There's something you

should know, Norther. You see, the

reason why...

EDWARD (V.O.)

I told Norther about the vagaries of

Texas oil money and its effect on

real estate prices, and how lax

enforcement of fiduciary process had

made savings and loans particularly

vulnerable.

NORTHER WINSLOW

I should go to Wall Street. That's

where all the money is.

EDWARD (V.O.)

I knew then that while my days as a

criminal were over, Norther's were

just beginning.

NORTHER WINSLOW

Edward, thank you for the hand!

EDWARD (V.O.)

When Norther made his first million

dollars, he sent me a check for ten

thousand. I protested, but he said

it was my fee as his career advisor.

EDWARD (V.O.)

Ten thousand dollars is no fortune

to most men. But it was enough to

buy my wife a proper house with a

white picket fence.

EDWARD (V.O.)

And for that, it was all the riches

a man could ever want.

TRANSITION TO:

EDWARD

I was drying out.

SANDRA

I see. We need to get you one of

those plant misters. We can spray

you like a fern.

EDWARD

Come now.

SANDRA

I don't think I'll ever dry out.

WILL

Is he awake?

SANDRA

He just fell asleep. Josephine's

with him.

WILL

Mom?

SANDRA

Yes?

WILL

Did you and Dad have any other

property?

SANDRA

(thinking)

I suppose your grandmother's house

when she passed on. But we sold that

right away. Your cousin Shirley bought

it.

WILL

So you never bought any land.

SANDRA

Heavens no. We had a hard enough

time keeping the mortgage on this

place.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Go back to the start. Right hand

only.

JENNY

Oh. Oh.

WILL

Hello.

JENNY

I wasn't expecting you.

WILL

Are you Jenny Hill?

JENNY

I am. And you're Will. I've seen

your picture, that's how I recognize

you. I almost said something at the

store, but it would have been awkward.

JENNY

(to the student)

Listen, Kenny. Why don't we skip the

lesson today? We can go again next

week.

STUDENT

Do I have to give it back to my Mom?

JENNY

I won't tell her if you won't.

WILL

How did you know my father?

JENNY

This was on his sales route, so he

was through here all the time.

Everyone in town knew him.

WILL

Were you and my father having an

affair?

JENNY

(taken aback)

Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was

expecting to dance around this for

another half hour.

WILL

I've seen him with women. He flirts.

He always has. On some level, I

presumed he was cheating on my mother.

I just never had proof.

JENNY

Can I ask you a question? Why did

you come here today? If you found

this deed, why didn't you just ask

Eddie?

WILL

Because he's dying.

JENNY

Look, I don't know how much you want

to know about any of this. You have

one image of your father and it would

be wrong for me to go and change it.

Especially this late in the game.

WILL

My father talked about a lot of things

he never did, and I'm sure he did a

lot of things he never talked about.

I'm just trying to reconcile the

two.

JENNY

The first thing you have to

understand, is that your father never

meant to end up here. And yet he

did, twice. The first time, he was

early. The second time, he was late.

JENNY (V.O.)

Those days, your father was working

for himself. If there was one thing

you could say about Edward Bloom,

it's that he was a social person,

and people took a liking to him. One

night he was returning from three

weeks on the road, when he hit a

thunderstorm unlike any in his life.

FLASH CUT TO:

JENNY (V.O.)

Fate has a way of circling back on a

man, and taking him by surprise.

"Welcome to Spectre."

JENNY (V.O.)

A man sees things differently at

different times in his life. This

town didn't seem the same now that

he was older.

JENNY (V.O.)

A new road had brought the outside

world to Spectre, and with it, banks,

liens and debt. Almost everywhere

you looked, people were bankrupt.

JENNY (V.O.)

Two different corporations were

looking at buying the town, if they

could get the price low enough. One

wanted to open a chicken processing

plant. The other, a municipal dump.

Either way, Spectre would be

destroyed.

EDWARD

Fifty-thousand!

JENNY (V.O.)

And so Edward Bloom decided to buy

the town, in order to save it.

JENNY (V.O.)

He was never a wealthy man, but he

had made other men rich, and now he

asked for their favors.

JENNY (V.O.)

Most of them had never seen Spectre --

they only had Edward's words to

describe it. That's all they needed.

He sold them on the dream.

JING

You can structure it as a historical

trust. But you'll need every

contiguous piece of property. It's

all or nothing.

JENNY (V.O.)

So first he bought the farms. Then

he bought the houses. Then he bought

the stores.

JENNY (V.O.)

Whatever he bought, the people were

not asked to leave or pay rent or

anything. They were just asked to

keep doing as they were doing. In

that way, he could make sure the

town would never die.

JENNY (V.O.)

Within six months, his trust had

purchased the entire town. With one

exception.

JENNY

You must be Edward Bloom.

EDWARD

How did you know?

JENNY

No one would come out here unless

they had business. And no one would

have business with me except for

you. You're buying the town.

EDWARD

Apparently I've overlooked this one

piece of it, and I'd like to remedy

that. You see, in order for the town

to be preserved, the trust must own

it in its entirety.

JENNY

So I've heard.

EDWARD

I'll offer you more than it's worth.

And you know you won't have to move.

Nothing will change except the name

on the deed, you have my word.

JENNY

Now let me get this straight. You'll

buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay

in it. You'll own the house, but

it'll still be mine. I'll be here,

and you'll come and go as you please

to one place or another. Do I have

that right?

EDWARD

In so many words, yes.

JENNY

Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If

nothing is going to change, I'd just

as soon it not change in the way it

hasn't been changing all this time.

EDWARD

It's not like you're going to lose

anything. You can ask anyone in town.

I've been nothing if not generous. I

want the best for everyone.

JENNY

Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this

land? Some sort of midlife crisis?

Instead of buying a convertible, you

buy a town?

EDWARD

Helping people makes me happy.

JENNY

I'm not convinced you should be happy.

EDWARD

I'm sorry. Have I offended you?

JENNY

No, you did exactly what you promised.

You came back. I was just expecting

you sooner.

FLASHBACK TO:

BACK TO:

EDWARD

You're Beamen's daughter. Your last

name is different.

(realizing)

You married.

JENNY

I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that

was a big difference.

JENNY

I won't be selling you this house,

Mr. Bloom.

EDWARD

I see. I thank you for your time.

EDWARD

I'm sorry.

JENNY

It's okay, just leave it.

EDWARD

I can get it. I can just...

EDWARD

Lord, I'm sorry I...

JENNY

Please. Go. Just go.

EDWARD

I'll...

JENNY

Go.

JENNY (V.O.)

Most men in that situation would

accept their failure and move on.

But Edward was not like most men.

JENNY (V.O.)

As the months passed, he found more

and more things to fix, until the

shack no longer resembled itself.

EDWARD

Of course, the best part was creating

new material. By the time the twins

and I got to Havana, we had a whole

new routine worked out for them,

with just a ukulele and a harmonica.

EDWARD

I suppose I should...

JENNY

You can leave it there.

EDWARD

No.

EDWARD

Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should

never have let you think that...

(beat)

I am in love with my wife.

JENNY

I know.

EDWARD

And from the moment I saw her until

the moment I die, she's the only

one.

JENNY

Lucky girl.

EDWARD

I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.

JENNY

Wait! Edward!

JENNY (V.O.)

One day, Edward Bloom left, and never

returned to the town he'd saved.

JENNY (V.O.)

As for the girl, the common belief

was that she'd become a witch, and

crazy at that. She became something

of a legend herself.

JENNY (V.O.)

And the story ended where it began.

WILL

Logically, you couldn't be the Witch,

because she was old back when he was

young.

JENNY

No, it's logical if you think like

your father. See, to him, there's

only two women: your mother and

everyone else.

WILL

You didn't become crazy.

JENNY

Well, therapy. And one day I realized

I was in love with a man who could

never love me back. I was living in

a fairy tale.

JENNY

People aren't like they are in

stories. They hurt each other without

meaning to. They are kind and

unbelievably cruel at the same moment.

Like me, now. I'm not sure I should

have told you any of this.

WILL

No, I wanted to know. I'm glad I

know.

JENNY

I wanted to meet you for the longest

time. I did.

(a smile)

I envied you so much. The way Eddie

would talk about you when you were

at Missouri, that award you won.

Congratulations, incidentally. And

when you got the job at the A.P.,

everything, he was so proud of you.

I mean, that's the thing. Every moment

he loved you.

JENNY

And as brightly as the sun would

shine when he was with me, every

time he left it disappeared. I wanted

to be as important to him as you

were, and I was never going to be. I

was make-believe and his other life,

you, were real.

JENNY

You knew that, didn't you?

CUT TO:

WILL

(calling out)

Hello? Mom? Dad?

JOSEPHINE (O.S.)

Will!

WILL

What happened?

JOSEPHINE

Your father had a stroke. He's

upstairs with your mom and Dr.

Bennett.

WILL

Is he going to be okay?

WILL

What I mean is, will he get back to

the way he was when...

JOSEPHINE

No. He won't. I'm sorry.

SANDRA

I don't suppose one of us could stay

with him. In case he...

(beat)

In case he wakes up, one of us should

be there.

WILL

I'll stay. Why don't you go home

with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.

SANDRA

(to Dr. Bennett)

That's okay?

DR. BENNETT

It's fine.

SANDRA

(to Will)

You'll call if...

WILL

I will. I'll call.

WILL

Mom, do you want some time with Dad?

SANDRA

Yes. Thank you.

TRANSITION TO:

JOSEPHINE

I'm sorry. It seems every hour I

have to...

SANDRA

I know. It was the same when I was

carrying Will. Like clockwork.

SANDRA

Do you like it, being pregnant?

JOSEPHINE

I do.

SANDRA

I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but

I loved every minute of it. I did.

Eddie was travelling a lot, so he

was gone, but I felt like I always

had a piece of him with me. A little

part of his soul inside me. I could

feel it. It was alive and kicking.

SANDRA

I really miss that.

JOSEPHINE

Don't stop. Don't.

DR. BENNETT

Glad to see you're not trying to

have a heartfelt talk. It's one of

my greatest annoyances, when people

talk to those who can't hear them.

WILL

My father and I have an advantage.

We never talk.

WILL

How long have you known my father?

DR. BENNETT

Thirty years. Maybe more.

WILL

How would you describe him?

DR. BENNETT

(re: chart)

Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated

hypertension.

(beat)

How would his son describe him?

DR. BENNETT

Did your father ever tell you about

the day you were born?

WILL

A thousand times. He caught an

uncatchable fish.

DR. BENNETT

Not that one. The real story. Did he

ever tell you that?

WILL

(suddenly interested)

No.

DR. BENNETT

Your mother came in about three in

the afternoon. Her neighbor drove

her, on account of your father was

on business in Wichita. You were

born a week early, but there were no

complications. It was a perfect

delivery. Now, your father was sorry

to miss it, but it wasn't the custom

for the men to be in the room for

deliveries then, so I can't see as

it would have been much different

had he been there. And that's the

real story of how you were born.

DR. BENNETT

Not very exciting, is it? And I

suppose if I had to choose between

the true version and an elaborate

one involving a fish and a wedding

ring, I might choose the fancy

version. But that's just me.

CROSSFADE TO:

WILL

Dad?

WILL

Dad! Do you want me to get a nurse?

WILL

What can I do? Can I help? Can I get

you something? Water?

EDWARD

(whispering)

The river.

WILL

The river?

EDWARD

Tell me how it happens.

WILL

How what happens?

EDWARD

How I go.

WILL

You mean what you saw in The Eye?

WILL

I don't know that story, Dad. You

never told me that one.

WILL

I can try, Dad. If you help. Just

tell me how it starts.

EDWARD

Like this.

WILL

Okay. Okay.

WILL

Okay. It's morning, and you and I

are in the hospital. I'd fallen asleep

in the chair. I wake up and I see

you, and...

CUT TO:

WILL

Dad?

WILL

(louder and concerned)

Dad?

EDWARD

Let's get out of here.

WILL (V.O.)

Somehow, you're better. Different.

You're getting ready to go. And I

say...

WILL

Dad, you're in no condition to...

EDWARD

There's a fold-up wheelchair in the

bathroom. Wrap a blanket around me.

As soon as we get off this floor,

we'll be in the clear.

EDWARD

Hurry! We don't have much time.

EDWARD

Faster!

DR. BENNETT

Will! I... What are you doing?

NURSE

Security! Stop them!

EDWARD

No time to explain! Follow us!

WILL (V.O.)

I pick you up and you hardly weigh

anything. I can't explain it.

EDWARD

Water. I need water.

EDWARD

Leave it! We won't need it.

BACK TO:

WILL

And we have to take Glenville to

avoid all the church traffic, because

those damn church people drive too

slow.

WILL

I ask...

BACK TO:

WILL (O.S.)

Where are we headed?

WILL (V.O.)

You say...

EDWARD

The River!

WILL (V.O.)

As we get closer to the river, we

see everybody's already there. And I

mean everybody.

PING

He's here!

WILL

It's unbelievable.

EDWARD

Story of my life.

WILL (V.O.)

And the strange thing is, there's

not a sad face to be found. Everyone's

just so glad to see you, and send

you off right.

EDWARD

Goodbye everybody! Farewell! Adieu!

THE CROWD (VARIOUS)

Goodbye Edward! / See ya! / We'll

miss you!

EDWARD

My girl in the river.

CROSSFADE BACK TO:

WILL

You become what you always were. A

very big fish.

(he smiles)

And that's the way it happens.

EDWARD

(a whisper)

Yes. Exactly.

WILL

(voice cracking)

Hi.

WILL (V.O.)

Have you ever heard a joke so many

times you've forgotten why it's funny?

But then you hear it again and

suddenly it's new. You remember why

you loved it in the first place.

TRANSITION TO:

SON

(to the other boys)

So he said he'd fight the giant who

was fifteen feet tall.

KID

No way.

SON

(calling over)

Dad, that's right, isn't it?

WILL

Something like that.

SON

See. So he was a giant but my grampa

was going to fight him because he

wasn't afraid of anything because

he'd seen how he was going to die in

this old lady's glass eye...

WILL (V.O.)

That was my father's final joke I

guess. A man tells his stories so

many times he becomes the stories.

They live on after him.

CROSSFADE TO:

WILL (V.O.)

And in that way, he becomes immortal.

THE END
