SIR THOMAS

I received a formal request for marriage

today for Anne.

From the Carey family.

SIR THOMAS indicates to

ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired.

Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children.

LADY ELIZABETH

But that's wonderful.

SIR THOMAS

I turned it down.

SIR THOMAS

And offered them Mary instead.

SIR THOMAS indicates

MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired.

Pretty. Sweet-natured.

SIR THOMAS

Fnne's too good for William Carey. She

can do (better than a merchant's son.

LADY ELIZABETH

You underestimate Mary.

SIR THOMAS

Not true. I think she's..the kinder of

the two. Quite possibly the fairer.

The CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race..

SIR THOMAS

But to get ahead in this world, you need

more than fair looks and a kind heart.

MARY, ten years older, and grown into a heavenly bride is in her

room, surrounded by MAIDS and SEAMSTRESSES making final

adjustments to her dress. A knock at the door.

ANNE

May we come in..?

ANNE and GEORGE enter. GEORGE lets out a low whistle..

ANNE

Look at you..! Younger than me. More

beautiful than me. Married before me.

(a beat)

I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other

Boleyn Girl.'

MARY

Hardly.

GEORGE

No, is this it? This is the end of the

unholy trinity?

GEORGE extends her arms, wraps them around his two sister. An

intimate moment.

MARY

No, George. Never. I'll be married,

that's all..

(a beat)

Apart from that - it won't change a

thing.

The three of them hug together, tightly..

A packed country church. The PRIEST officiates in Latin. The air

is thick with incense. And winter cold..

3.

The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled on one side. FATHER,

MOTHER, the DUKE and DUCHESS of NORFOLK, brother GEORGE, and

finally ANNE..

PRIEST

Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in

nobis..

The PRIEST sprinkles the ring with holy water. WILLIAM CAREY,

(35), puts it on MARY's finger.

across the church. Obviously attracted. ANNE notices.

The party afterwards. MUSICIANS play. The bride and groom,

(WILLIAM and MARY), are dancing, surrounded by WELL-WISHERS and

other GUESTS..

WILLIAM

Are you happy?

MARY

Very.

WILLIAM

You don't secretly wish you'd married

someone grander? With a title?

MARY

No. I want a husband who loves me. And

who thinks it first thing every morning.

And last thing at night.

WILLIAM

Then you've found the right man.

IN ANOTHER CORNER:

ANNE is dancing with her brother GEORGE. She looks up to see the

NOBLEMAN who was staring at her across the church..

ANNE

Who is that? He was staring at me in

church?

GEORGE

That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of

Northumberland. Richest landowner in

England.

ANNE's eyes widen in interest, "Really?"

(CONTINUED)

4.

GEORGE

But don't get your hopes up. He is

already betrothed.

GEORGE indicates a tall, haughty-looking FIANCEE beside PERCY..

ANNE

Betrothed is not married, brother

George. A lot can happen before you

reach the altar.

ANNE stares over at HENRY PERCY. Who stares back.

IN ANOTHER CORNER:

THOMAS gets to his feet..

SIR THOMAS

Thomas..

ELIZABETH), and kisses her..

NORFOLK

I think I have managed to persuade the

King to come and stay with you on

progress. A week-end's hunting in late

summer.

SIR THOMAS

But that's wonderful! Thank you, thank

you so much..

(he turns to ELIZABETH)

Did you hear that, Elizabeth?

LADY ELIZABETH

(hates the idea)

Yes.

SIR THOMAS

Finally we can present George, and with

luck, get him a position at court.

LADY ELIZABETH excuses herself, and leaves..

NORFOLK

These are difficult times. I have it on

good authority that the Queen no longer

bleeds - yet the matter of a male heir

is still not resolved.

It cannot be long before the King is

forced to look outside the marriage.

(CONTINUED)

5.

SIR THOMAS

What? And make a bastard King of

England?

NORFOLK

A legitimized bastard. What choice does

he have?

(a beat)

Obviously, I've given it thought, and

wondered which Howard girl I could put

under his nose. Imagine the influence

that would give us. To be blood family

of the next King of England. Equally,

imagine if another family were to

achieve the same?

NORFOLK indicates SIR JOHN SEYMOUR in the corner, and his two

loathsome, ambitious sons EDWARD and THOMAS..

SIR THOMAS

What about Anne?

SIR THOMAS turns, and indicates ANNE across the crowds, who's

dancing with GEORGE...

SIR THOMAS

I realise as a `Boleyn' she is not

officially a `Howard', but as your

sister's daughter..

NORFOLK

But she's your eldest, Thomas. Your

first born. And your favourite. Wouldn't

you prefer her to have a nice,

uncomplicated, respectable marriage?

Like Mary?

SIR THOMAS

If Anne were an uncomplicated,

respectable girl like Mary, then I'd say

`yes'. But she's not.

SIR THOMAS looks out at ANNE..

SIR THOMAS

She's anything but.

INT. BOLEYN CASTLE - DAY

SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH stand in a corner, watching the

party continue. ELIZABETH's face darkens..

ADY ELIZABETH

don't like it. It would cost a fortune

to make our house fit for a royal visit.

Money we don't have.

(CONTINUED)

And what if theDY ELIZABETH(cont'd)

LA king doesn't like her?

Or if she sleeps with him but gives him

a girl?

SIR THOMAS

And what if you were to look on the

bright side? Just once?

An ominous clap of thunder outside..

SIR THOMAS

Risk nothing, you gain nothing.

LADY ELIZABETH

hen was it that people stopped thinking

of ambition as a sin, and started

thinking of it as a virtue?

SIR THOMAS

Easy for you to say. You've had power

and wealth all your life.

LADY ELIZABETH

Until I married you, Thomas. And I was

happy to give it up.

LADY ELIZABETH turns, and walks back inside.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

ANNE knocks on the door of her father's study. She waits.

Presently, the door opens. We see SIR THOMAS inside..

ANNE

You asked to see me father?

SIR THOMAS

Yes. Come in.

SIR THOMAS closes the door.

MARY is in a bathroom. Being prepared by ANNE for her wedding

night. ANNE brushes her sister's hair. Rubs oil in her skin.

MARY

Hever. I'm so happy for George.

ANNE

Yes. But Father took me aside. It seems

he has ambitions for me, too.

MARY

What? What are you saying..?

ANNE

It's known the King has a wandering eye.

Imagine...if he were to like me?

MARY

But...you could never be more than his

mistress. And that's no substitute for a

husband.

ANNE

But as the King's mistress the least I'd

get after he finished with me would be

an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And

gave him what his wife has failed to?

Quite apart from the money, it'd be a

Duke at least.

MARY

But what about your happiness? Your

future?

ANNE

I could be a happy Duchess.

ANNE

Are you nervous?

MARY

A little.

ANNE

You'll tell me everything in the

morning?

MARY

I promise.

ANNE

No details spared?

The door opens, and WILLIAM CAREY appears in the doorway. ANNE

curtseys, gives MARY a last `Good luck' kiss, then goes.

MARY stares at her husband.

MARY

Hold me a moment?

WILLIAM CAREY envelops MARY with his arms..

MARY (cont'd)

I'm so lucky to have a man who is

content with what he has.

MARY looks at him..

MARY (cont'd)

You are, aren't you?

WILLIAM CAREY smiles, looks at his gorgeous bride..

WILLIAM

I am the luckiest man in the world.

WILLIAM reaches for the wine..

WILLIAM (cont'd)

Drink?

MARY shakes her head. But WILLIAM tenderly insists..

WILLIAM (cont'd)

You should. It will hurt less.

MARY nervously drinks..

WILLIAM (cont'd)

Lie back.

MARY lies down. Then she lifts up her nightdress. WILLIAM pulls

down his trousers.

MARY extends her hands. Inviting him to join her. WILLIAM slowly

lowers himself on top of her. He enters her.

MARY smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. A side to her one

might not have imagined.

But one or two strokes later, and WILLIAM's knuckles whiten, his

face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her.

MARY looks up. Surely that wasn't it?

WILLIAM (cont'd)

Thank you.

It's true.

ANNE

The universities in Spain and the

Never!

They just want to protect you. Leave

nothing to chance.

But in who's interests do they imagine

Anne will act? Certainly not mine.

Why DO they make this room such a

dungeon? Does it really need to be this

Don't worry. She's had three years to

forgive you. And she's not going to risk

being sent away again. She'll do as

ANNE slowly gets to her feet. HENRY looks up. When he sees

ANNE's face, his face falls..

ANNE is a woman transformed. Gone are the simple clothes, puppy

fat and lack of confidence.

ANNE has become a glorious, head-turning siren; dressed in

daring French clothes.

plunges sexily. Her sleeves are long and loose, offering daring

flashes of arm and elbow..

Like every other red-blooded MAN in the room, HENRY is utterly

mesmerised. Speechless..

HENRY

So? What is so amusing, Anne? Perhaps we

might hear and judge for ourselves?

ANNE dark, intelligent eyes stare back at HENRY. Suddenly, all

ANNE

A neighbouring King, who's name one is

forbidden to mention at court. Whose

reputation haunts him in his thoughts

and dreams.

ANNE

Whose armies and navy thwart his every

endeavour. Whose physical and

intellectual endowments are known far

and wide.

ENRY laughs too. Enjoying this..

ANNE

In order to restore his confidence, this

French King spends a fortune on anything

that glitters, on building of castles

with large towers..

ANNE artfully gestures the phallic implications..

ANNE

But these symbols of wealth and virility

fail to convince. Talk among the ladies

ANNE, putting his arms around her, then..

HENRY

Wolsey has agreed to draw up plans for

the Queen to be sent to a nunnery.

That woman married two brothers and

that not a single one of them found time

STAFFORD

It's Anne. She's turning this country on

test the validity of his marriage, and

put the QueenM on trial.

QUEEN KATHERINE, screaming in protest, surrounded by wailing

LADIES-IN-WAITING, is dragged roughly away from court by a unit

of ARMED GUARDS..

KATHERINE

How dare you!

Silence! Enough of your GAMES!

brought her no peace. The cacophony from outside visibly

troubles her. MARY stands by her side. Maid of honour.

ANNE

Did you hear? On the way to the church?

They were calling me a witch.

MARY

All that will die down as soon as they

get to know you.

ANNE

But what if it doesn't? What if they

hate me forever?

MARY

They won't. They will see how much the

King loves you, and follow.

ANNE

How much the King loves me?

ANNE shoots an anxious look over at HENRY, who is with CROMWELL,

in the corner, lost in serious conversation..

MARY

ister, I wonder if you've given any

thought..to the matter of my returning

to the country. With the children.

ANNE's face: her expression changes. Suddenly fearful.

ANNE

What? No! I need you here more than

ever. Besides, as the Queen's sister,

you can't live alone out there like some

gypsy. We need to make you a proper

match.

STAFFORD

Wait! Mary..

STAFFORD catches her up..

STAFFORD

I couldn't help overhearing. And before

STAFFORD takes a deep breath. His heart racing..

Mary...I love you. There..I've said it.

From the moment I joined your family..

heard those words before, and puts two and two together..

her ears. She sits at the foot of ANNE's bed. ANNE sits in bed.

Heavily pregnant. On the other side is GEORGE.

ANNE

God, I look hideous.

ANNE

Little nips and stabs.

MARY isn't listening. She is lost in thought.

GEORGE

Just imagine. It it's a boy. The unholy

trinity will be mother, uncle and aunt

to the next King of England.

ANNE

But if it isn't? The King will take that

as evidence of God's displeasure. And

will turn further against me. He's

already become so cold.

ANNE touches her stomach anxiously..

ANNE

They say you can tell by the shape of

giving birth. With a bone-chilling scream, a head appears..

MIDWIFE

ANNE pushes again. MARY holds her. ANNE howls in agony. Her

nails dig into the sheets. A last, primal, blood-curdling roar

of pain..

Well done...

PHYSICIANS and MIDWIVES swarm around the baby. ANNE, despite

King. HENRY staggers from the disappointment, as if he had been

delivered a blow..

SIR THOMAS

She has named her Elizabeth. After your

HENRY

SIR THOMAS

Perfectly, Sir.

HENRY stares, hollow-eyed. Finally..

ENRY

Well, if we can have a healthy daughter,

we can have a healthy son.

HENRY turns, and without a word, pushes past everyone, and

leaves. ANNE is left alone, her heart breaking..

MARY stares at ANNE. A stab of compassion. Not long ago the same

thing happened to her. Hoping to console ANNE, MARY hands her

beautiful new BABY over to her...

something that will almost certainly mean her destruction.

ANNE, visibly pregnant, sits on a throne. Alone. She looks

drawn, frightened, and tired. An unmistakable echo of QUEEN

KATHERINE at the masked ball earlier.

EORGE

And so, it's come to this. Our sister is

with child, and all England's fate is in

the balance.

EORGE indicates ANNE..

GEORGE (cont'd)

If it's a boy, the King will have been

vindicated in getting rid of his first

wife, and his authority will be

unassailable. But if it isn't. Or if,

God forbid, she miscarries.

EORGE indicates HENRY, who's face is also drawn, dark,

malevolent, suspicious. Barely recognisable.

GEORGE

The King will have to move swiftly to

silence his enemies. He will claim

innocence. That he was corrupted. Anne

will swiftly be replaced as Queen, by

someone more `acceptable'.

show our faces at court again.

MARY enters, calls out, `Hello?'. No answer.

Inside: it's warm, inviting, idyllic. The CHILDREN go to the

MARY walks along a corridor. She looks in the bedroom.

MEN's clothes in the wardrobe. No sign anywhere of a woman's

presence. MARY turns, then catches sight of herself in a mirror.

Her hair is bedraggled. Her clothes are filthy.

WILLIAM STAFFORD and several FARM-HANDS return from working in

their separate ways. STAFFORD rides on for a while..

Time has passed. Winter has become spring. We're in an idyllic

A dance is in progress. MUSICIANS play. Fifty or so GUESTS.

MARY is talking to a friend. In another corner: she notices a

MESSENGER arrive. A former COLLEAGUE from court.

family. I cannot desert them.

MARY

Henry and Catherine have you. Anne and

George have no one.

ANNE is led into a great courtroom lit by flickering torches,

and filled with fifty or sixty of the country's most powerful

NOBLEMEN. ANNE walks to the centre of the room, surveying her

`jurors', noting that they have remained seated..

ANNE

It is a sad day for England when the

nobles do not rise for their Queen.

NORFOLK

And even sadder when that same Queen is

charged with adultery and incest.

ANNE

Charged is different to convicted,

Uncle. Or is it not? In this court?

Deathly silence. The clearing of throats. Then with much chair

scraping, the NOBLES reluctantly get to their feet..

NORFOLK

Master Cromwell, read out the

indictment..

CROMWELL gets to his feet..

CROMWELL

The charge is that in the twenty-eighth

year of the reign of our Sovereign

Henry, King of England, his wife, the

Queen, being seduced by the Devil, did

knowingly commit adultery, high treason

and offences against God.

NORFOLK

How do you plead?

ANNE

Not guilty, my Lord.

ANNE

My noble Lords..the love I have for my

brother is the love any sister would

have for someone with whom she has grown

up in the same house, nursed when sick,

played games as children, shared life's

celebrations.

As ANNE delivers this speech, our CAMERA slowly pulls back,

back, towards the door..

ANNE

That is the love I have for him. Not

what you suggest.

Our CAMERA pulls out through the door...

..and into a corridor beyond, where we find HENRY hunched in

shadows, eavesdropping, his face cast in shadows..

ANNE (V/O)

Judge me, my Lords, as you see fit. But

never forget that your verdicts will be

judged again by God, in the greatest

court of all..

HENRY's face is a study of guilt. His knuckles whiten, his nails

dig into his hands..

vote.

ANNE watches on as each LORD takes it in turn to get to his

feet, and deliver his verdict. First CROMWELL, then the

SEYMOURS, then HENRY PERCY..

The verdicts rain down on ANNE, `Guilty, guilty, guilty', going

round the courtroom, until they reach the DUKE of NORFOLK. ANNE

meets the eyes of her UNCLE..

NORFOLK

Guilty.

NORFOLK stares at ANNE. Not a hint of compassion..

In which case, the burden falls on me to

pass sentence.

GEORGE BOLEYN's eyes are covered with a cloth. He puts his head

on the block. A PRIEST says last rites as GEORGE's arms are held

back. Terrified, his lips mouth prayers..begging forgiveness.

The axe falls. A huge ROAR goes up.

BOLEYN.

HENRY walks through corridors arm in arm with JANE SEYMOUR,

followed closely by the SEYMOUR BROTHERS, SIR JOHN SEYMOUR and

the ever-surviving DUKE of NORFOLK..

HENRY turns a corner, then stops in his tracks when he

sees...MARY waiting outside his Privy Chamber, restrained by

GUARDS. Seeing the King, she curtseys deeply..

HENRY

Mary..?

The SEYMOUR BROTHERS draw their swords, but the KING's DOG runs

excitedly towards her. HENRY gestures for the SEYMOURS to sheath

their swords..       H

ENRY

The SEYMOURS leave. The DUKE of NORFOLK hesitates..

His private room. His sanctuary. Where he took her before. The

room to which only MARY seems to have had access..

MARY

Your Majesty..

ENRY

I am bound by the law.

MARY

You could send her to a nunnery. No one

would know.

HENRY

Anne? To a nunnery?

HENRY almost manages a smile.

MARY

There is precedent, my Lord. Louis of

France did it, too. When his wife could

not conceive.

HENRY

The French Queen was a blameless woman.

Your sister a witch.

MARY

I understand Anne has offended you. I

ask only that if there is any regret you

might..feel yourself.

ENRY

What?

MARY

For your part in the matter..

MARY treads delicately. Realising the very suggestion is

treason.

MARY

..does not unduly colour your thinking.

Killing Anne will not make it go away.

The doors to ANNE's cell open. ANNE looks up. In the doorway is

MARY. MARY stares at ANNE..

ANNE's appearance is shocking. She looks ten years older.

Haggard and lined by stress.

ANNE puts on a brave face, stares back at MARY.

Tears run onto each other's shoulders..

ANNE looks out through a narrow window. Her intense, fearful

eyes flit and dart..

ANNE

They're letting the crowds in.

MARY

It's all right. You will be spared. The

King as good as gave me his word.

ANNE

The King saw you?

MARY

Yes.

ANNE manages a rueful smile..

ANNE

We all made a mess of that, didn't we?

We all underestimated little Mary.

ANNE looks at MARY..

ANNE

I don't think he ever stopped loving

you.

MARY

That's not true.

ANNE

It is. He never loved me in the same

way. And deep down you know it.

MARY averts her eyes..

You should have been Queen. You even

gave him a son. But instead all this has

A roar of the crowd. ANNE, wearing a shawl of white ermine, is

violently jostled and spat at as she's marched across Tower Hill

to the scaffold. She shoots MARY an anxious look across the

crowds..

MARY shoots a signal, "Don't worry." ANNE climbs the steps, and

faces the CROWDS. Finally the jeers subside..

ANNE

I...I come here to die...a loyal

subject..

More spit, jeers and abuse. MARY stands on tiptoe, cranes her

neck. Anxiously scans the CROWDS for the GUARDS that will free

ANNE..

MARY

Come on..

ANNE

..I..I do not blame the King. Never was

there a more just or goodly Lord..

MARY continues to read the letter, as ANNE is forced to kneel by

the EXECUTIONER..

CROMWELL (V.O.)

"But you risked your life coming to

court and you are advised you not to do

so again. You will not be shown the same

clemency a second time. Your sister Anne

was tried and found guilty, her crimes

were high treason and she deserves to

die. Cromwell."

MARY, who is reading, looks up in horror..

MARY

No!

ANNE looks up. She sees the look on MARY's face.

MARY's eyes.

ANNE's eyes.

`WHOOSH', the masked EXECUTIONER swings his sword. ANNE is

beheaded. MARY almost chokes..

The CROWD falls eerily silent. A stunned calm descends on Tower

Green. Nothing but the sound of the wind.

MARY sways, then falls backwards, having lost consciousness. She

falls, falls..but is caught by a strong pair of arms..
