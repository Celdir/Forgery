Interview with the Vampire

David Geffen

FADE IN:

LOUIS

So you want me to tell you the

story of my life...

MALLOY

That's what I do. I interview

people. I collect lives. F.M.

radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed

a genuine hero, a cop who -

LOUIS

(quietly interrupting)

You'd have to have a lot of tape

for my story. I've had a very

unusual life.

MALLOY

So much the better. I've got a

pocket full of tapes.

LOUIS

You followed me here, didn't you?

MALLOY

Saw you in the street outside. You

seemed interesting. Is this where

you live?

LOUIS

It's just a room...

MALLOY

So shall we begin?

(playfully, almost

teasing)

What do you do?

LOUIS

I'm a vampire.

MALLOY

See? I knew you were interesting.

You mean this literally, I take it?

LOUIS

Absolutely. I was watching you

watching me. I was waiting for you

in that alleyway. And then you

began to speak.

MALLOY

Well, what a lucky break for me.

LOUIS

Perhaps lucky for both of us.

LOUIS

I'll tell you my story. All of it.

I'd like to do that very much.

MALLOY

You were going to kill me? Drink my

blood?

LOUIS

Yes but you needn't worry about

that now. Things change.

MALLOY

You believe this, don't you? That

you're a vampire? You really

think...

LOUIS

We can't begin this way. Let me

turn on the light.

MALLOY

But I thought vampires didn't like

the light.

LOUIS

We love it. I only wanted to

prepare you.

MALLOY

Good God!

LOUIS

Don't be frightened. I want this

opportunity.

MALLOY

How did you do that?

LOUIS

The same way you do it. A series of

simple gestures. Only I moved too

fast for you to see. I'm flesh and

blood, you see. But not human. I

haven't been human for two hundred

years.

LOUIS

What can I do to put you at ease?

Shall we begin like David

Copperfield? I am born, I grow up.

Or shall we begin when I was born

to darkness, as I call it. That's

really where we should start, don't

you think?

MALLOY

You're not lying to me, are you?

LOUIS

Why should I lie? 1791 was the year

it happened. I was twenty-four -

younger than you are now.

MALLOY

Yes.

LOUIS

But times were different then. I

was a man at that age. The master

of a large plantation just south of

New Orleans...

DISSOLVE

TO:

LOUIS (V.O.)

I had just lost my wife in

childbirth. She and the infant had

been buried less than half a year.

LOUIS (V.O.)

I was twenty-four and life seemed

finished. I couldn't bear the pain

of their loss. I longed for a

release from it.

LOUIS (V.O.)

I wanted to lose everything. My

wealth, my estate, my sanity. But

Lady Luck didn't oblige.

LOUIS

You're calling me a cheat?

GAMBLER

I'm calling you a piece of shit -

LOUIS

Then do me a favor. Get rid of this

piece of shit...

LOUIS

You lack the courage of your

convictions, sir. Do it.

LOUIS (V.O.)

Most of all I longed for death. I

know that now. I invited it, a

release from the pain of living...

LOUIS

My invitation was open to anyone.

Sailors, thieves, whores and

slaves...

LOUIS (V.O.)

But it was a vampire that accepted.

LESTAT

They would have killed you -

LOUIS

Then my luck would have changed.

LESTAT

You want death? Is it death you

want?

LOUIS

Yes...

LESTAT

You still want death? Or have you

tasted it enough?

LOUIS

Enough...

MALLOY

That's how it happened?

LOUIS

No. The Gift of Darkness requires

more than that, as you'll see.

LOUIS (V.O.)

He left me half dead that morning.

he wanted something from me. He

came back the following night.

LOUIS

Who the hell are you? What are you

doing in my house?

LESTAT

And a beautiful house it is too.

Yours is a good life, isn't it?

LESTAT

You're not afraid of anything, are

you?

LOUIS

Why should I be?

LESTAT

Are you going to put that through

me too? Ruin my beautiful clothes?

LESTAT

Were all last night's promises for

nothing?

LOUIS

What do you want from me?

LESTAT

I've come to answer your prayers.

You want to die, don't you? Life

has no meaning anymore, does it?

LESTAT

The wine has no taste. The food

sickens you. There seems no reason

for any of it, does there? But what

if I could give it back to you?

Pluck out the pain and give you

another life? And it would be for

all time? And sickness and death

could never touch you again?

DISSOLVE

TO:

LESTAT

Vampires, that's what we are.

Creatures of darkness, only we see

it that darkness more clearly than

any mortal has ever seen...

LESTAT

Wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain

goodbye? To wave away anguish and

grief? To embrace the peace of the

unending night?

MARBLE CHILD

Papa...

LOUIS

Diane!!!!

LESTAT

They are gone, Louis. Death took

them. Death which you can now

destroy...

LOUIS

NO!!!!!

LESTAT

You have to ask me for this. You

have to want it, do you hear me?

LOUIS

Give it to me!!!

LESTAT

Vampires. We thrive on blood.

LOUIS

I want it!

LESTAT

Tomorrow night. You must prove

yourself. I will give you the

choice I never had.

LESTAT

The sun's coming up. Watch it

carefully. If you come with me

tomorrow, you'll never see it

again.

LOUIS (V.O.)

My last sunrise. That morning I was

not yet a vampire, and I saw my

last sunrise. I remember it

completely, yet I don't remember

any sunrise before it. I watched

the whole magnificence of the dawn

for the last time, as if it were

the first. And the I said goodbye

to sunlight and went out to become

what I became.

LESTAT

Your grief has unhinged you. You've

let your estate rot.

LESTAT

You let your overseer run riot,

work your slaves to the bone. We'll

start with him.

LOUIS

How do you mean, start?

LESTAT

Call him.

LOUIS

Carlos!!!

LESTAT

Why the bloody whip, Carlos?

LESTAT

Let's call that a start.

LOUIS

I can't do it.

LESTAT

You've just done it -

LOUIS

Kill me if you will, but I can't do

this...

LESTAT

Don't worry. He was white trash,

they come at two a penny. I dumped

him in the swamp and untied the

slave, licked his wounds clean.

LOUIS

You're the devil, aren't you?

That's who you are.

LESTAT

(gently)

I wish I were. But if I were, what

would I want with you?

LOUIS

I can't go through with it, I tell

you.

LESTAT

Your perfect. Your bitter and

you're strong.

LOUIS

But why do you want me?

LESTAT

Because you're as strong as I was

when I was alive.

LESTAT

You really want to be with them?

LOUIS

Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you

promised -

LESTAT

You asked for death. I didn't

promise it -

LESTAT

It's not your wife and child my

friend. It's death. Just that

simple. Think and choose. It

happens to everyone. Except us.

LESTAT

We shall be this way always, my

friend. Young as we are now. I'm

lonely for a companion, lonely for

your strength. But I'm not that

lonely. Do you want to come or not?

LOUIS

Yes...

LESTAT

Did I hear a yes?

LOUIS

Yes...

LESTAT

I've drained you to the point of

death. If you drink from me you

live for ever. If I leave you here

you die.

LOUIS

No. Don't leave me here. Give it to

me.

LESTAT

You're sure?

LOUIS

Sure...

LESTAT

Stop staring at my buttons. Didn't

I tell you it was going to be fun?

LESTAT

You're body's dying. Pay no

attention. It will take twenty

minutes at most.

LOUIS

Dying?

LESTAT

It happens to us all.

LESTAT

Come, you're going to feed now.

LOUIS

I want a woman.

LESTAT

That doesn't matter anymore, Louis.

You'll see. Come...

LESTAT

They're all beautiful now. Men,

women, the old, the young...simply

because they are alive. -

LESTAT

Take him.

LOUIS

The crucifix -

LESTAT

Forget the crucifix. Take him.

LESTAT

Resist no more Louis. Feed...

LOUIS

What have I done?

LESTAT

You have fed. You were made for

this...

LOUIS

Dear God, what have I done?

LESTAT

You've killed Louis. And enjoyed

it.

LOUIS

Dear God, what have I become????

MALLOY

You said the slave had a

crucifix...

LOUIS

Oh, that rumor about crosses?

MALLOY

You can't look at them...

LOUIS

Nonsense, my friend. I can look on

anything I like. And I am

particularly fond of looking on

crucifixes.

MALLOY

The story about stakes through the

heart?

LOUIS

The same. As you would say today...

Bull shit.

MALLOY

What about coffins?

LOUIS

Coffins... coffins unfortunately

are a necessity...

LOUIS (V.O.)

Killing is no ordinary act. It is

the experience of another's life

for certain. That night I had lost

my own life and taken another's. I

was drowning in a sea of human

guilt and regret, with all the

heightened senses of a vampire...

LESTAT

Yes, that's you, my handsome

friend. And you'll look that way

till the stars fall from heaven.

LOUIS

It can't be...

LESTAT

Give it time. You're like a man who

loses a limb and still imagines he

feels pain. It will pass. And we

must sleep now. I can feel the sun

approaching.

LESTAT

You must get into it. It's the only

safe place for you when the light

comes.

LOUIS

And if I don't?

LESTAT

The sun will destroy the blood I've

given you. Every tissue, every

vein. The fire in this lantern

could do that too.

LESTAT

Don't be afraid. In moments you'll

be sleeping as soundly as you ever

slept. And when you awake I'll be

waiting for you, and so will all

the world.

LOUIS

You told me something earlier. You

said you didn't have a choice. Was

that true?

LESTAT

Someday I'll tell you. We have a

lot of time to talk to each other.

You might say... we have all the

time we shall ever need.

LOUIS

Dear God, what have I done?

LOUIS (V.O.)

I awoke the next evening to a

different world. And I realized

there are as profound differences

between vampires as between human

beings...

LESTAT

Your wealth, dear Louis, is

inestimable. Your income from

cotton alone will keep us in

comfort for a century.

LOUIS (V.O.)

I sat there staring at him with

contempt. He had the soul of a

shopkeeper, he was the sow's ear

out of which nothing fine could be

made. I felt sadly cheated in

having him as a teacher...

LESTAT

You'll get used to killing. Just

forget about that mortal coil.

You'll become accustomed to things

all too quickly.

LOUIS

Do you think so?

YVETTE

You are not hungry, sir...

LESTAT

Au contraire, my dear. He could eat

a horse...

LOUIS (V.O.)

I looked at anything mortal and saw

all life as precious, condemning

all fruitless guilt and passion

that would let it slip through the

fingers like sand...

LOUIS (V.O.)

It was only as a vampire that I

could see Yvette's beauty. Her fear

of me increased my desire.

LOUIS

I will finish it, Yvette. Now leave

us.

LESTAT

Can't you pretend, you fool? Don't

give the game away. We're lucky to

have such a home.

LESTAT

Pretend to drink, at least.

LESTAT

Such fine crystal shouldn't go to

waste...

LESTAT

I know. It gets cold so fast.

LOUIS

We can live like this? Off the

blood of animals?

LESTAT

I wouldn't call it living. I'd call

it surviving. A useful trick if

you're caught for a month on a ship

at sea.

LESTAT

There's nothing in the world now

that doesn't hold some...

LOUIS

Fascination...

LESTAT

Yes. And I'm bored with this

prattle -

LOUIS

But we can live without taking

human life. It's possible.

LESTAT

Anything is possible. But just try

it for a week. Come into New

Orleans and let me show you some

real sport!

LOUIS (V.O.)

This was New Orleans, a magical and

magnificent place to live. In which

a vampire, richly dressed might

attract no more notice in the

evening than hundreds of other

exotic creatures.

TERESA

Come on, mon cher. The best in the

colony. Once you touch this you'll

never go to any other tavern again.

LESTAT

You think so, cherie? But what if

I'd rather taste your lips?

TERESA

My lips are even sweeter still...

LESTAT

Let's get out of here!

LOUIS

Have you ever been caught?

LESTAT

Of course not. It's so easy you

almost feel sorry for them.

LOUIS (V.O.)

Lestat killed two, sometimes three

a night. A fresh young girl, that

was his favorite for the first of

the evening.

LOUIS (V.O.)

But the triumphant kill of Lestat

was a young man. They represented

the greatest loss to Lestat because

they stood on the threshold of the

maximum possibility of life.

LESTAT

The trick is not to think about it.

See that one? The widow St. Clair?

she had that gorgeous young fop

murder her husband. She's perfect

for you. Go ahead.

LOUIS

But how do you know?

LESTAT

Read her thoughts.

LOUIS

I can't.

LESTAT

The dark gift is different for each

of us. But one thing is true of

everyone. We grow stronger as we go

along.

LESTAT

Take my word for it. She blamed a

slave for his murder. And do you

know what they did to him?

LESTAT

The evildoers are easier. And they

taste better...

WIDOW ST. CLAIR

Now, young man, you really amaze

me! I'm old enough to be your

grandmother.

WIDOW ST. CLAIR

Yes, that's the melody, I remember

it. Oh yes...

WIDOW ST CLAIR

Murder!!! Murderer!!

WIDOW ST CLAIR

My little papillions! My

butterflies!!! He killed them!!!

LESTAT

You whining coward of a vampire who

prowls the night killing rats and

poodles. You could have finished us

both!

LOUIS

What have you done to me? You've

condemned me to hell.

LESTAT

I don't know any hell -

LOUIS

You want to see me kill? Watch me

kill you then -

LESTAT

What strength, my friend, what

strength. I remember why I chose

you now.

LESTAT

But you can't kill me, Louis. Nor I

you.

LESTAT

Feed on what you want, mon cherie.

Rats, chickens, doves, goats. I'll

leave you to it and watch you come

round. Just remember, life without

me would be even more unbearable...

LOUIS (V.O.)

Being a vampire to him meant

revenge. Revenge against life-

itself. Every time he took a life

it was revenge. and the slaves with

a wisdom that was denied their

masters, began to notice...

WIFE

Yes... please...

LESTAT

Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a

vampire has to be clever for many

reasons. Here all one needs is a

pair of fangs.

LOUIS

Paris? You came from Paris?

LESTAT

As did the one who made me.

LOUIS

Tell me about him. You must have

learnt something from him! It had

to happen for you as it did for me!

LESTAT

I learnt absolutely nothing. I

wasn't give a choice, remember?

LOUIS

But you must know something about

the meaning of it all, you must

know where we come from, why we...

LESTAT

Why? Why should I know these

things? Do you know them?

LESTAT

(gripping his temples)

That noise! It's driving me mad!

We've been in the country for

weeks, with nothing but that

noise!!!

LOUIS

They know about us. They see us

dine on empty plates and drink from

empty glasses.

LESTAT

Come the New Orleans then. There's

an opera on tonight. A real french

opera! We can dine in splendor!

LOUIS

I respect life, don't you see? For

each and every human life I have

respect.

LESTAT

Respect me a little then. I'm the

only life you know.

LESTAT

You'll soon run out of chickens,

Louis...

YVETTE

Michi Louis? You don't want any

supper?

LOUIS

No, ma cher. I need no supper. Is

all well at Pointe Du Lac tonight?

YVETTE

We worry about you master. When do

you ride about the fields? How long

since you've been to the slave

quarters? Everywhere there is

death. Animals, men. Are you our

master still at all?

LOUIS

(dazed)

Leave me alone now, Yvette.

YVETTE

I will not go unless you listen to

me. Send away this new friend of

yours. The slaves are frightened of

him. They are frightened of you.

LOUIS

I am frightened of myself, Yvette.

LOUIS

Hush, Yvette -

LOUIS

This place is cursed. Damned, do

you hear me? And your master is the

devil.

LOUIS

Get out while you can. You're free

men.

LOUIS

Unlike me, you are no free men...

LOUIS

Do I have to convince you?

LESTAT

You fool, what have you done?

LOUIS

What you wouldn't do. It's almost

sunrise. It will be the sun or the

fire. You said they can kill me.

The sun or the fire!

LOUIS

Where are we?

LESTAT

Where do you think, my idiot

friend? We're in a nice filthy

cemetery. Does this make you happy?

Is this fitting and proper enough?

LOUIS

We belong in hell.

LESTAT

And what if there is no hell, or

they don't want us there? Ever

think of that?

MALLOY

You loved Yvette...

LOUIS

Can a vampire feel love?

MALLOY

You loved your wife, surely.

LOUIS

I was human then. Might as well ask

can an angel feel love. Both are

blesses or cursed with a certain...

detachment. Though whether angels

take as long to learn it as I, I

will never know.

LOUIS

Yes, I loved Yvette. As I loved

Pointe Du Lac. And as with each

thing I loved, I destroyed it.

LOUIS (V.O.)

Lestat I did not love. And he

survived.

WHORE #1

You're skin's icy.

LESTAT

Not always...

LESTAT

Your friend has no head for wine.

WHORE

She's stupid. I can warm that cold

skin of yours better than she can.

LESTAT

Do you think so?

WHORE

Why you're warm now.

LESTAT

Ah, but the price is pretty high.

Your sweet friend - I exhausted

her.

LOUIS

I'm leaving you. I can't stand this

any longer.

LESTAT

What, no flowery speeches? About

what a monster I am? What a vulgar

fiend?

LOUIS

I'm not interested in you. You

disgust me. I'm interested in my

own nature and know I can't trust

you to tell me the truth about me.

LESTAT

What do you imagine you are Louis?

LOUIS

I don't pretend to know.

LESTAT

Don't you understand, Louis, that

you alone of all creatures can see

death with impunity... you alone

under the rising moon can strike

like the hand of God.

LOUIS

Lestat, she's alive!!!

LESTAT

Vampires are killers. Predators,

who's all seeing eyes were meant to

give them detachment.

LOUIS

The girl, Lestat -

LESTAT

I know. Let her alone.

LESTAT

You think you can be human. You

think you can go back. But you

can't. You live off the blood of

rats now Louis. How human is that?

LESTAT

Lie still, love...

LESTAT

You're tired love, you want to

sleep.

LOUIS

Why do you do this Lestat?

LESTAT

I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take

you aesthete's taste to purer

things. Kill them swiftly if you

will, but do it! For now doubt, you

are a killer Louis. Ah!

GIRL

It's a coffin, a coffin! Get me

out!

LESTAT

Of course it's a coffin. You're

dead, love.

LOUIS

Lestat - finish this -

LESTAT

You finish her - if you feel so

much -

GIRL

You won't let me die, will you?

You'll save me?

LESTAT

But it's too late, love. Look at

your wrist, you breast.

LESTAT

Unless I make her one of us...

LOUIS

NO!!!

LESTAT

THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!

LOUIS

My God... to think you... are all I

have to learn from...

LESTAT

In the old world, they called it

the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it

to you.

LOUIS (V.O.)

Am I damned? Am I from the devil?

Is my very nature that of a devil?

And all the while, as these dreaded

questions caused me to neglect my

thirst, my thirst grew hotter, my

veins were threads of pain in my

flesh, my temples throbbed.

MAN

Don't go that way Monsieur. It's

the plague. Go back the way you

came.

LOUIS

The way I came...

LOUIS (V.O.)

... and finally, when I could stand

it no longer, I stood in an empty

desolate street and heard the sound

of a child crying.

CLAUDIA

Mama, please wake up. Mama, I'm

frightened, please wake up.

CLAUDIA

Monsieur, please help us. Papa's

waiting for us at the ship. Please

wake mama, Monsieur.

LOUIS (V.O.)

And if I am damned, why do I fell

such pity for her gaunt face? Why

do I wish to warm her tiny arms?

Comfort her beating heart?

LESTAT

Ah, my philosopher, my martyr.

"Never take a human life". Well you

must admit it is funny. Or is it

merely touching? I'm not sure.

LESTAT

Let's make some party of it, shall

we? Maybe there's some life in the

old lady yet?

LESTAT

Come back, Louis, you are what you

are. The plague would have got her

within hours anyway. Merciful Death

how you love your precious guilt.

LOUIS (V.O.)

For years I had not savored a

human. And when I had Lestat's

words made sense to me. I knew

peace only when I killed and when I

heard her heart in that terrible

rhythm I knew again what peace

could be. Yet even then I could not

contenance it...

LESTAT

All I need to find you Louis is

follow the corpses of rats.

LESTAT

Pain is terrible for you. You feel

it like no other creature because

you are a vampire. You don't want

it to go on.

LOUIS

No...

LESTAT

Do what it is in your nature to do.

And you will feel as you felt with

that child in your arms.

LOUIS

Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt

an end to the craving.

LESTAT

That and more.

LESTAT

Evil is a point of view. God kills,

indiscriminately, and so shall we.

For no creatures under God are as

we are, none so like him as

ourselves.

LOUIS

Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?

LESTAT

Ah, but we have even more in common

with our creator. come, I am like a

mother tonight. I want a child.

LESTAT

She's here, your wounded one.

LOUIS

What are you saying?

LESTAT

You need company, Louis. More

congenial than mine...

LOUIS

Lestat!

LESTAT

You remember how you wanted her,

the taste of her -

LOUIS

I didn't want to kill her.

LESTAT

Don't worry, Louis, you're

conscience is clear. You left her

alive.

LESTAT

Claudia, Claudia, listen to me.

You're ill, my precious and I'm

going to give you what you need to

get well.

LOUIS

Lestat, what do you mean?

LESTAT

That's it dear. More. You must

drink it to get well.

LESTAT

Stop, that's enough. No more.

CLAUDIA

I want more.

LOUIS

What have you done?

CLAUDIA

More.

LESTAT

Yes, cherie, of course you want

more. And I'll show you how to get

it. You drink from morals, my

beauty, but from me? Never again.

MAID

Ah, quelle Belle enfant!

LESTAT

Gently, cherie. They are so

innocent. They must not be made to

suffer.

LOUIS

You are the devil! You are the

instrument of Satan!

LESTAT

That's enough, cherie. Stop before

the heart stops.

CLAUDIA

I want some more.

LESTAT

It's bet in the beginning, lest the

death takes you down with it. yes,

that's it. My child. My beloved

child.

CLAUDIA

Where is Mamma?

LESTAT

Mamma's gone to Heaven, cherie,

like that sweet lady over there.

They all go to Heaven. And you did

very well, cherie. Not a drop

spilt. Very good! You're going to

be our child now.

LESTAT

Your mama's left you with us. She

wants you to be happy.

LOUIS

(whispers)

You are the devil! You are the

instrument of Satan!

LESTAT

Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our

little daughter?

CLAUDIA

I'm not your daughter.

LESTAT

Yes you are, my dearest. You are

mine and Louis' daughter. You see

Louis was going to leave us. He was

going to go away. But now he's not.

He's going to stay and make you

happy.

CLAUDIA

Lou...eee...

LOUIS

You fiend. You monster.

LESTAT

One happy family.

MALLOY

A child vampire!

LOUIS

Shall we go on?

MALLOY

He did it to make you stay with

him!

LOUIS

Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I

would love her more than the waking

world. But there was more to it

than that. Perhaps in the end he

did it - to show me that he could.

For he lavished affection on her,

there was no doubt about that. Life

was very different with madame

Claudia, as you can imagine...

DRESSMAKER

Monsieur, I need more light. I

shall go slind if you do not bring

me a lamp, or let me fit this child

during the day. Ouch!

CLAUDIA

Let me kiss it better...

LOUIS (V.O.)

A little child she was, but also a

fierce killer, now capable of the

ruthless pursuit of blood with all

a child's demanding.

LESTAT

Claudia, Claudia, will you never

learn? Who will we get now to

finish your dress? A little

practicality, cherie...

LOUIS (V.O.)

She would sleep in my coffin,

daily, curl her child's fingers

round my hair as she dreamt of I

know not what...

LOUIS (V.O.)

Mute and beautiful, she played with

dolls, dressing them and undressing

them by the hour.

LOUIS (V.O.)

Mute and beautiful, she killed. And

to watch her kill was chilling.

WOMAN

Why are you crying, child?

WOMAN

Are you lost, my love?

CLAUDIA

Mama...

WOMAN

Hush now, don't cry, We'll find

her...

CLAUDIA

Mama...

LOUIS (V.O.)

They found death fast in those

days, before she learnt to play

with the, to delay the moment till

she had taken what she wanted...

PIANO-TEACHER

The thumb girl! Mind the thumb!

DOLLMAKER

They are expensive, my dear. Maybe

too expensive for a young girl like

you...

LOUIS (V.O.)

She grew, yet stayed the same. She

wanted a bed of her own, yet would

climb back into mine.

LESTAT

Claudia, Claudia! Didn't I tell

you, never in the house!

CLAUDIA

September 21st, one hour after

sunset. The sky is still violet,

the way Louis loves and as always

Lestat was gone when we rose.

LOUIS

How did you learn to write,

Claudia?

CLAUDIA

The way I learn everything. By

watching you.

CLAUDIA

But you never let me see you kill,

Louis.

LOUIS

Lestat taught you all you need to

know about that.

CLAUDIA

Infant death, he calls me. Sweet

daughter death. You know what he

calls you? Merciful death.

LOUIS

He jests.

CLAUDIA

Why does he call you that?

LOUIS

Hush, Claudia don't talk about such

things. Show me your book.

LOUIS

Claudia! You did that?

CLAUDIA

Sit still. It's not finished -

LOUIS (V.O.)

Time can pass fast for mortals when

they're happy. With us it was the

same.

LOUIS (V.O.)

It was a very different life. And a

new century was beginning. what had

once been a small godforsaken

French colony was growing into a

great port, giving us an endless

train of magnificent strangers...

LOUIS (V.O.)

All human life was here, for the

taking. And we took, all three of

us, in our different ways...

YOUTH

You want to come inside, lovely?

YOUTH

Ever been kissed?

CLAUDIA

She's like me, Louis. Small and yet

not small at all. Like me.

LOUIS (V.O.)

I watched her grow yet stay the

same, her doll-like face possessed

of adult eyes, eerie, powerful,

seductive...

CLAUDIA

Another doll? I have ten, you

realize.

LESTAT

Well, I thought you could use

another.

CLAUDIA

Why always on this night?

LESTAT

What night? What do you mean?

CLAUDIA

You always give me the doll on the

same night of the year.

LESTAT

I didn't realize.

CLAUDIA

Is this my birthday?

LESTAT

Some of these are so old and

tattered. You should throw them

away.

CLAUDIA

I have. Or there would be twice as

many.

LESTAT

But you're the fairest by far.

CLAUDIA

You dress me like a doll. You make

my hair like a doll. Why?

CLAUDIA

You want me to be a doll forever?

LOUIS

Claudia - don't -

CLAUDIA

Why not?

CLAUDIA

Can't I change, like everybody

else?

CLAUDIA

Which of you did it? Which of you

made me the way I am?

LESTAT

What you are? You would be

something other than you are?

CLAUDIA

And if I cut my hair again?

LESTAT

It will grow back again!

CLAUDIA

But it wasn't always so! I had a

mother once! And Louis - he had a

wife! He was mortal the same as

she! And so was I!

LOUIS

Claudia -

CLAUDIA

You made us what we are, didn't

you?

LESTAT

Stop her Louis!

CLAUDIA

DID YOU DO IT TO ME????

CLAUDIA

(whispering)

How did you do it?

LESTAT

And why should I tell you? It's in

my power.

CLAUDIA

Why yours alone? Tell me how it was

done!!!!

LESTAT

Be glad I made you what you are!

You'd be dead not if I hadn't.

LOUIS

(tenderly)

We're immortal. You've always known

that.

CLAUDIA

Tell me why... you've got to tell

me...

LOUIS

You see the old woman? That will

never happen to you. You'll never

grow old. You will never die.

CLAUDIA

And it means something else too,

doesn't it? I shall never, ever

grow up.

CLAUDIA

I hate him. But I cannot bear to

lose you. You're the only companion

I have, forever. You taught me

everything I know. Please tell me

Louis. Tell me how it came to be

that I am this... thing...

LOUIS

Come... I've something to show

you...

LOUIS (V.O.)

Though everything was changed,

through the years had warped the

contours of the streets, I found my

way there, aware that I'd always

known where it was and avoided it,

not wanting to pass the doorway

where I'd first heard Claudia cry.

LOUIS

I heard you crying. You were there

in a room with your mother. You

were hugging her for warmth, crying

pitifully as you had been for days.

Because your mother was dead...

LOUIS

I opened the shutters... I came

into the room... I felt pity for

you. Pity, but something else.

CLAUDIA

You... fed on me?

LOUIS

And he found me with you. I ran,

sickened at what I'd done. Then he

cut his wrist and fed you from him.

I tried to stop him, but you were a

vampire then. And have been every

night hereafter.

CLAUDIA

You both did it?

LOUIS

I took your life. He gave you

another one.

CLAUDIA

And here it is. And I hate you

both.

MALLOY

But why did you tell her?

LOUIS

How could I not? She had to know.

MALLOY

And did you lose her? Did she go?

LOUIS

Where would she have gone? She was

a child, and beautiful,

heartbreaking merciless child. And

I had made her that...

LOUIS

I walked all night. I walked as I

walked years before when my mind

swam with guilt at the thought of

killing. I found myself at the

Cathedral.

LOUIS

I thought of all the things I had

done and couldn't undo. And I

longed for one second's peace...

LOUIS

I had no fear. If anything I longed

for something to happen, for the

stones to tremble as I entered the

foyer.

LOUIS

I almost genuflected from old

habit. I almost prayed.

LOUIS

And then it struck me.

LOUIS

What if the statues gave an image

to nothing? What if I was the

supernatural in this cathedral? The

only immortal under this roof. And

I felt nothing but loneliness.

Loneliness to the point of madness.

PRIEST

You wish to go to confession? I was

about to lock up the church.

PRIEST

You are troubled, aren't you? Can I

help?

LOUIS

It's too late, too late -

PREIST

No, it's never too late. Come...

LOUIS

Bless me father for I have sinned

so often and so long, I don't know

how to change nor beg for

forgiveness.

PRIEST

Son, God is infinite in his

capacity to forgive. Tell him from

your heart.

LOUIS

Murders, father, death after death.

The woman who died two nights ago

in Jackson Square, I killed her.

And thousands of others before her.

I have walked the streets of New

Orleans like the Grim reaper. And

fed on human life for my own. I am

a vampire, father, and have turned

the one I love most of all into on

too -

PRIEST

Do you know the meaning of

sacrilege?

LOUIS

Then there is no mercy.

LOUIS

You talk of sacrilege. Why if God

exists does he suffer me to exist?

LOUIS

Why does he suffer me to live?

CLAUDIA

Locked together in hatred -

CLAUDIA

But I can't hate you Louis.

CLAUDIA

Is this the aroma of a mortal

child?

CLAUDIA

Louis. Lover.

CLAUDIA

I was mortal to you. You gave me

your immortal kiss. You became my

mother and my father. And so I'm

yours. Forever.

CLAUDIA

But now's the time to end it,

Louis. Now's the time to leave him.

LOUIS

He'll never let us go.

CLAUDIA

Oh... really?

LOUIS (V.O.)

So we made plans. She was convinced

there were others of our kind in

Europe, that they would have the

answers Lestat couldn't provide.

Lestat whom she now hated, who she

thought she could be free of. I

doubted, but then she had a

surprise in store...

LESTAT

What is it now? You irritate me!

Your very presence irritates me!

CLAUDIA

(sweetly)

Does it?

LESTAT

Yes. And I'll tell you something

else! I've met someone who will

make a better vampire than both of

you.

CLAUDIA

Is that supposed to frighten me?

LESTAT

You're spoilt because you're an

only child. You need a brother. Or

I do. I'm weary of you both.

CLAUDIA

I suppose we could people the world

with vampires, the three of us.

LESTAT

Not you my dear.

CLAUDIA

You're a liar. But you upset my

plans.

LESTAT

What plans?

CLAUDIA

I came to make peace with you, even

if you're the father of lies. I

want things to be as they were.

LESTAT

Stop pestering me then!

CLAUDIA

Oh, Lestat. I must do more than

that. I've brought a present for

you.

LESTAT

Then I hope its a beautiful woman

with endowments you will never

possess.

CLAUDIA

Better than that.

CLAUDIA

You haven't fed enough. I can tell

by your color.

LESTAT

Oh, Claudia, you've outdone

yourself. Where did you find them?

CLAUDIA

Drunk on brandy wine. A thimbleful.

I thought of you when I saw them.

LESTAT

We forgive each other then?

LESTAT

Absinthe? You gave them absinthe?

CLAUDIA

No. Laudanum.

LESTAT

Laudanum!

CLAUDIA

Yes. It killed them, unfortunately.

But it keeps the blood warm.

LESTAT

Ah Louis, Louis, she killed them...

and let me drink...

CLAUDIA

Don't Louis -

LESTAT

Louis, put me in my coffin...

CLAUDIA

I'll put you in your coffin.

Forever.

LOUIS

Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!

LESTAT

Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift -

help me -

LOUIS

What have you done, Claudia -

CLAUDIA

Louis! Look what's happening to

him!!

LOUIS

Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.

CLAUDIA

Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.

CLAUDIA

Goodnight, sweet prince, may

flights of devils wing you to your

rest.

LOUIS

He's dead, Claudia, dead.

CLAUDIA

The one good lesson he taught me,

Louis. Never drink from the dead.

CLAUDIA

Help me. We must get rid of him.

CLAUDIA

Should we burn him? Bury him? What

would he have liked, Louis?

LOUIS

Don't mock, Claudia...

CLAUDIA

The swamp...

CLAUDIA

In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our

own kind. Find the one who made

him. Learn what it means.

LOUIS

And suppose the one who made him

knows nothing and the vampire who

made him knows nothing, and it goes

back, nothing proceeding from

nothing, until there is nothing!

And we must live with the knowledge

that there is no knowledge.

LOUIS

And if we find the one who made

him? Do we tell him we destroyed

his own creation? The vampire

Lestat?

CLAUDIA

He belongs with those reptiles,

Louis. He deserved to die.

LOUIS

Then maybe so do we. Every night of

our lives. He was my brother. My

maker. He gave me this life,

whatever it is.

CLAUDIA

I did it for us, Louis. So we could

be free.

CLAUDIA

Louis, look at me.

LOUIS

(bitterly)

I can't. Go away from me.

LOUIS

Claudia - You're crying -

CLAUDIA

You never talked to me like that -

in all these years.

LOUIS

And you never cried -

CLAUDIA

I can't bear it when you do - I

would die rather than lose you

Louis. I would die the way he died.

LOUIS

Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -

CLAUDIA

Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I

did it for you -

LOUIS

I love you Claudia. Always. And we

are free now, Claudia. No Lestat.

Just the two of us, beginning the

great adventure of our lives.

LOUIS

The birds. We forgot about the

birds. There's nothing for it but

to let them go.

CLAUDIA

What was that?

LOUIS

The workmen must have a trunk -

don't stop, cherie -

CLAUDIA

Louis!!!

CLAUDIA

Don't Louis -

LESTAT

WHERE IS SHE? WHERE IS THAT

ACCURSED CHILD?

LOUIS

It can't be -

CLAUDIA

It is! Take the back stairwell -

LESTAT

GIVE ME HER LOUIS!!

LOUIS

Stay back - for the love of God...

or I'll burn you alive...

CLAUDIA

The ship is sailing without us!

LOUIS

Not yet. Holding her tightly, Louis

runs.

LOUIS (V.O.)

Though the fire seemed to spread

through the quartier, I stood on

that deck until dawn, fearful he

would come out again of the very

river like some monster to destroy

us both. And all the while I

thought, Lestat, we deserve your

vengeance. You gave me the dark

gift. And I delivered you into the

hands of death for the second time.

MALLOY

Did he die in the fire?

LOUIS

He was dead to us. We were free.

That was all that mattered.

LOUIS (V.O.)

Though the ship was blessedly free

of rats, a strange plague

nonetheless struck its passengers.

LOUIS (V.O.)

Claudia and I alone seemed immune.

We kept to ourselves, pondering the

mystery of Lestat and the greater

mystery of each other.

LOUIS (V.O.)

We reached the Mediterranean. I

wanted those waters to be blue.

They were black, nighttime waters

and how I suffered then, straining

to remember the color that a young

man's senses had taken for granted,

that my memory had let slip away

for eternity. It was black off the

coast of Italy, black off the coast

of Greece, Europe itself was black.

CLAUDIA

Louis, your quest is for darkness

only. This sea is not your sea.

They myths of men are not your

myths. Their history isn't yours.

LOUIS (V.O.)

We saw the Acropolis by moonlight,

shades of grey and silver. And I

longed for the brilliant white of

those marbles in the hot sun of

Homer...

LOUIS (V.O.)

We docked at Varna and searched the

rural countryside of the

Carpathians, for what she liked to

term "our kind"...

LOUIS

The quest for these Old World

vampires filled me with bitterness.

We searched village after village,

ruin after ruin and I was glad when

always we found nothing. For what

could the damned really have to say

to the damned?

MALLOY

You found nothing?

LOUIS

Peasant rumors, superstitions about

garlic, crosses, stakes in the

hear, all that - how do you say

again? Bull shit. But one of our

kind? Not a whisper.

MALLOY

No vampires in Transylvania? No

Count Dracula?

LOUIS

Fictions, my friend. The vulgar

fictions of a demented Irishman...

So we repaired to Paris...

LOUIS (V.O.)

I think the very name of Paris

brought a rush of pleasure to me

that was extraordinary. I was a

Creole, after all and Paris was the

mother of New Orleans, a universe

whole and entire unto herself...

LOUIS

We were alive again. We were in

love and so euphoric was I that I

yielded to her every desire...

CLAUDIA

Help me, mon chere...

CLAUDIA

How do I look?

LOUIS

Still my beautiful child.

CLAUDIA

A beautiful child! Is that what you

still think I am?

LOUIS

Yes...

CLAUDIA

Why do you turn away? Why don't you

look.

CLAUDIA

You want me to be your daughter

forever, don't you?

LOUIS

Yes.

CLAUDIA

Well tell me, papa. What was it

like making love?

CLAUDIA

You don't remember? Or you never

knew.

LOUIS

It was something hurries...and

seldom savored... something acute

that was quickly lost. It was the

pale shadow of killing.

CLAUDIA

But how will I ever know, Louis?

CLAUDIA

I'll never find them, will I? My

own kind...

CLAUDIA

Have I anything in common with her,

Louis?

CLAUDIA

Or her, or her - or any of them?

LOUIS

Claudia, you torture yourself.

CLAUDIA

They are ducklings, that will grow

into swans. Whereas I must be the

duckling forever.

LOUIS

You are more beautiful than any of

them.

CLAUDIA

All her dolls resemble me.

CLAUDIA

Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never

change either.

LOUIS

You are neither, Claudia. Now stop

this -

LOUIS

You know her?

CLAUDIA

Yes. Should I take her, Louis?

Among her dolls? make a doll of her

in turn?

LOUIS

Come, Claudia...

LOUIS (V.O.)

For a time we had been almost

human, in the sensual whirl of what

Paris had to offer. But the human

delights of that city only served

to remind her of the ageless child

she had become. I felt her pain as

I walked until I become aware that

I was being followed.

LOUIS

Claudia!

LOUIS (V.O.)

So it was when I had given up the

search for vampires that a vampire

found me...

LOUIS & STATIAGO

(simultaneously)

Clever.

LOUIS

You mean me harm?

SANTIAGO

(a beat later)

You mean me harm?

LOUIS

Trickster. Buffoon!

LOUIS

I've searched the world for an

immortal and this is what I find?

ARMAND

He looks like an angel.

ARMAND

You are all right.

ARMAND

Bring the petit beauty with you. No

one will harm you. I won't allow

it. Remember my name. Armand.

LOUIS

Remember what I've told you.

They'll have different powers.

They'll read your thoughts if you

allow it.

CLAUDIA

But this can't be real. This is

nonsense.

LOUIS

Nonsense all right. But something

tell me it's going to be the

strangest nonsense we've ever seen.

CLAUDIA

Mortals, mortals everywhere. And

lots of drops to drink.

LOUIS

They are here. I know they are.

Listen for something that doesn't

make a sound.

LOUIS

(whispers)

It's a vampire. It's the one I saw

in Rue St Jacques.

LOUIS

They use no paint. And the audience

think it is paint.

CLAUDIA

How devilishly clever.

CLAUDIA

She's no vampire.

LOUIS

No. She's frightened. She doesn't

know where she is.

MORTAL WOMAN

I don't want to die!

SANTIAGO

We are death!

MORTAL WOMAN

Someone help me. Please... What

have I done?

LOUIS

This is no performance.

CLAUDIA

And no one knows but us...

SANTIAGO

We all die. Death is the one thing

you share with all those here.

MORTAL WOMAN

But I'm young...

SANTIAGO

Death is no respecter of age. He

can come any time, any place. Need

I tell you what fate has in store

for you?

MORTAL WOMAN

I would take my chance. Let me go!

Please...

SANTIAGO

And if you take that chance and

live, what is your fate? The

humpbacked toothless visage of old

age?

LOUIS

This is monstrous!

CLAUDIA

Yes, and very beautiful.

SANTIAGO

Just as this flesh is pink now, it

will turn grey and wrinkle with

age.

MORTAL WOMAN

Let me live, please. I don't care.

SANTIAGO

Then why should you care if you die

now?

SANTIAGO

And suppose death had a heart to

love and to release you? To whom

would he turn his passion? Would

you pick a person from the crowd

there? A person to suffer as you

suffer?

YOUNG GIRL

Oh, yes, take me Monsieur Vampire!

I adore you!

SANTIAGO

You wait your turn.

SANTIAGO

Well, have you a sister, a mother,

a daughter you would send in your

place?

SANTIAGO

We alone can give death meaning. Do

you know what it means to be loved

by death, to become our bride?

ARMAND

No pain.

MORTAL WOMAN

No pain?

ARMAND

Your beauty is a gift to us.

ARMAND

Who deserves such a gift?

MORTAL WOMAN

No pain...

LOUIS

I've seen enough of this! I loathe

it!

CLAUDIA

Be still!

CLAUDIA

Patience, Louis. Patience.

LOUIS

We've been searching for you for a

very long time...

ESTELLE

Such a darling.

LOUIS

Monstrous.

ARMAND

Yes, and very beautiful.

LOUIS

Your lips, they didn't move.

ARMAND

They did, but too fast for you to

see them. No magic, just grace and

speed.

ARMAND

He wants you...

ARMAND

Disappointing, isn't it? To come so

far and find so little. Jaded

ingenues, amusing themselves with

make- believe...

LOUIS

We had feared we were the only

ones...

ARMAND

But how did you come into

existence?

ARMAND

You don't want to answer... Two

vampires from the new world, come

to guide us into the new era as all

we love slowly rots and fades away.

LOUIS

Are you the leader of this group?

ARMAND

If there were a leader, I would be

the one.

LOUIS

So you have the answers...

ARMAND

Ah! You have questions?

LOUIS

What are we?

ARMAND

Nothing if not vampires...

LOUIS

Who made us what we are?

ARMAND

Surely you know the one who made

you...

LOUIS

But the one who made him, who made

the one who made him, the source of

all this evil...

ARMAND

That is a picture, nothing more.

LOUIS

You mean we are not children of

Satan?

ARMAND

No.

ARMAND

I understand. I saw you in the

theatre, your suffering, your

sympathy for that girl. I saw you

with the boy. You die when you

kill, you feel you deserve to die

and you stint on nothing. But does

that make you evil? Or, since you

comprehend what you call goodness,

does it not make you good?

LOUIS

Then there is nothing.

ARMAND

Perhaps...

ARMAND

And perhaps this is the only real

evil left...

LOUIS

Then God does not exist...

ARMAND

I have not spoken to him...

LOUIS

And no vampire here has discourse

with God or the Devil?

ARMAND

None that I've ever known. I know

nothing of God or the Devil, I have

never seen a vision nor learnt a

secret that would damn or save my

soul. And as far as I know, after

four hundred years I am the oldest

living vampire in the world.

LOUIS

My God... So it's as I always

feared. Nothing, leading to

nothing.

ARMAND

You fell too much. So much you make

me feel...

ARMAND

The one who made you should have

told you this. The one who left the

old world for the new...

LOUIS

He knew nothing. He just didn't

care.

ARMAND

Knew? You mean he is...

CLAUDIA

Come, beloved. It's time we were on

our way. I'm hungry and the city

waits.

ARMAND

So soon to go?

LOUIS (V.O.)

The place was dark as we left, a

darkness that confounded even

Claudia. And as we blundered

through it, again came the thought:

I have wronged Lestat, I have hated

him for the wrong reasons.

SANTIAGO

How did you wrong him?

LOUIS

You read my thoughts?

SANTIAGO

You said a name -

LOUIS

A name I don't want to say again.

SANTIAGO

I seemed to recognize it...

SANTIAGO

There is but one crime among us

vampires here.

SANTIAGO

You should know, who are so

secretive about the vampire who

made you.

CLAUDIA

Boredom!

SANTIAGO

It is the crime that means death to

any vampire. To kill your own kind!

CLAUDIA

Aaaah! I was so afraid it was to be

born like Venus out of the foam, as

we were! Come Louis, let's go!

CLAUDIA

I loathe them! I can't stand the

sight of them! Stupid bourgeois

Parisians, all dressed in black

like some private club! I've

searched for them the world over

and I despise them!

LOUIS

What danger?

CLAUDIA

I can feel it from them! They want

to know who made us, what became of

him. They have their rules, their

idiotic rules!

LOUIS

Do you think I would let them harm

you?

CLAUDIA

No, you would not, Louis. Danger

hold you to me.

LOUIS

Love holds you to me. And we are in

danger, not you.

CLAUDIA

Love?

CLAUDIA

You would leave me for Armand if he

beckoned you.

LOUIS

Never.

CLAUDIA

He wants you as you want him. He's

been waiting for you. He wants you

for a companion. He bides his time

that place. he finds them as dull

and lifeless as we do.

LOUIS

That's not so.

CLAUDIA

Do you know what his soul said to

me without saying a word? When he

put me in that trance...

LOUIS

So you felt it too!

CLAUDIA

Let him go, he said. Let him go.

CLAUDIA

Is that what I should do Louis? Let

you go? My father? My lover? My

Louis, who made me?

LOUIS

He can protect us, Claudia.

CLAUDIA

You really believe that?

ARMAND

I was waiting for you...

LOUIS

Listen to me.

LOUIS

Claudia is dear to me. My...

daughter.

ARMAND

Your lover.

LOUIS

No, my beloved, my child.

ARMAND

If you say so. You are innocent.

LOUIS

I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid.

She feels she's in danger from the

others.

ARMAND

She is.

LOUIS

But why?

ARMAND

I could give you reasons. Her

silence. Her youth. It's forbidden

to make so young, so helpless, that

cannot survive on its own.

LOUIS

Then blame the one who made her...

ARMAND

Did you kill this vampire who made

you both? Is that why you won't say

his name? Santiago thinks you did.

LOUIS

We want no quarrel with him.

ARMAND

It's already begun. If you want to

save her, send her away.

LOUIS

Then I leave too.

ARMAND

So soon? Without any of those

answers you so longed for?

LOUIS

You said there were none.

ARMAND

But you asked the wrong questions.

Do you know how few vampires have

the stamina for immortality? How

quickly they perish of their own

will.

LOUIS

We can do that?

ARMAND

You would never give up life. If

the world were reduced to one empty

cell, on fragile candle, you stay

alive and study it. You see too

clearly. You see too much.

LOUIS

That's what the one who made me

said.

ARMAND

How he must have loved you.

ARMAND

Louis, I need you more than he ever

did. I need a link with this

century. The world changes. We do

not. Therein lies the irony that

ultimately kills us. I need you to

make contact with this age.

LOUIS

He? Don't you see? I'm not the

spirit of any age! I'm at odds with

everything and always have been!

I'm not even sure what I am!

ARMAND

But Louis, that is the very spirit

of your age. The heart of it. You

fall from grace has been the fall

of a century.

LOUIS

And the vampires of the Theatre?

ARMAND

Like moths around the candle of the

age. Decadent, useless. They can't

reflect anything. But you do. You

reflect its broken heart.

ARMAND

Are these not the answers you came

for?

LOUIS

(softly)

Yes... My God...

ARMAND

A vampire with a human soul. An

immortal with a mortal's passion.

You are beautiful, my friend.

Lestat must have wept when he made

you -

LOUIS

Lestat! You knew Lestat!

ARMAND

Yes I knew him. Knew him well

enough not to mourn his passing.

ARMAND

But you must go now. You must get

her safely out of Paris.

ARMAND

No-one else knows of this door.

When you knock you will find me

waiting...

LOUIS (V.O.)

I felt a kind of peace at last. I

had found the teacher which Lestat

could never, I knew now, have been.

I knew knowledge would never be

withheld by Armand. It would pass

through him as through a pane of

glass. And I knew Claudia must

leave me...

CLAUDIA

Madeleine... Louis is shy.

MADELEINE

Drink.

CLAUDIA

Do it Louis. Because I cannot do

it. I haven't the strength. You saw

to that when you made me.

LOUIS

You haven't the vaguest conception

under God of what you ask!

MADELEINE

Au contraire, monsieur, I have.

CLAUDIA

You have found your new companion,

Louis! You will make me mine!

LOUIS

How do we seem to you? Do you think

us beautiful, magical, our white

skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you

ask me! Have you any idea of the

thing you will become?

CLAUDIA

Your evil is that you cannot be

evil! And I will suffer for it no

longer!

LOUIS

Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do

it!

CLAUDIA

Yet you could do it to me!

Snatching me from my mother's hands

like two monsters in a fairy-tale!

Couldn't you have waited? Six more

years and I would have had that

shape! And now you weep! You

haven't tears enough for what

you've done to me.

CLAUDIA

You give her to me! Do this before

you leave me!

CLAUDIA

Oh God! I love you still, that's

the torment of it. But you know I

must leave you Louis...

LOUIS

Yes...

CLAUDIA

And who will care for me my love,

my dark angel, when you are gone?

LOUIS

You promise to care for her then?

MADELEINE

Yes...

LOUIS

And you know what you ask for?

MADELEINE

Yes.

LOUIS

What do you think she is,

Madeleine? A doll?

MADELEINE

A child who can't die...

LOUIS

(softly)

And the child who did die?

MADELEINE

My daughter...

LOUIS

Look at the gaslight. Don't take

your eyes off it. You will be

drained to the point of death, but

you must stay alive. Do you hear

me?

MADELEINE

Yes!

CLAUDIA

(whispers)

Louis!

LOUIS

She is dying. It happened to you

too, but your child's mind can't

remember.

CLAUDIA

But if she dies...

LOUIS

It's only mortal death.

LOUIS

Bear me no ill will, my love. We

are now even.

CLAUDIA

What do you mean?

LOUIS

What died tonight inside that room

was not that woman. It will take

her many nights to die, perhaps

years. What has died in that room

tonight is the last vestige in me

of what was human.

CLAUDIA

Yes father. At last. We are een.

ESTELLE

Time for justice, little one.

LOUIS

Armand! Get me Armand! he wouldn't

countenance this -

SANTIAGO

You can make no demands here!

Buffoon! Bastard -

LESTAT

Louis...

SANTIAGO

Is he the one?

LESTAT

No, the child. The child was the

one...

SANTIAGO

All the murderers!!!

LOUIS

You are alive, Lestat! It can't be

murder! Tell them how you treated

us...

LESTAT

No... You come back to me Louis...

LOUIS

Are you mad???

ESTELLE

The sentence is death! To all of

them!!!

LESTAT

Only the girl - it was the girl -

LESTAT

You promised me - I could take him

back to New Orleans - Louis -

there's something I must tell you -

about that night - that night I met

you -

LOUIS

You let her go, Lestat - you let

her free - and I'll come back with

you -

SANTIAGO

Death for the others. For you

eternity in a box -

SANTIAGO

Walled in a dungeon. Your only

company will be your screams...

Perhaps it will take centuries...

LESTAT

He's coming home with me - you

promised -

SANTIAGO

(laughing)

We promised nothing!

LOUIS

They've fooled you, Lestat! You

must reach Armand! Armand has the

power!

LOUIS

Claudia!!!

ARMAND

Above him, reaching down to take

his hand.

ARMAND

Hurry. Don't make a sound.

LOUIS

Where is she? Where's Claudia?

ARMAND

Follow me - that way - through my

cell -

LOUIS

Not without Claudia. Where is she?

ARMAND

I can't save her.

LOUIS

You can't believe I'd leave without

her. Armand! You must save her! You

have no choice.

ARMAND

Louis, I can't save her. I will

only risk losing you -

LESTAT

You'll come home with me Louis? For

a little while... until I am myself

again.

LOUIS

CLAUDIA!!!

ARMAND

I couldn't prevent it.

LOUIS

I don't believe you. I do not have

to read your soul to know that you

lie.

ARMAND

Louis, they cannot be brought back.

There are some things that are

impossible, even for me.

LOUIS

You let them do it.

LOUIS

You held sway over them. They

feared you. You wanted it to

happen.

ARMAND

Louis, I swear I did not.

LOUIS

I understand you only too well. You

let them do it, as I let Lestat

turn a child into a demon. As I let

her rip Lestat's heart to pieces!

Well I am no longer that passive

fool that has spun evil from evil

till the web traps the one who made

it. Your melancholy spirit of this

century! I know what I must do. And

I warn you - you saved me tonight,

so I return the favor - do not go

near your cell in the Theatre Des

Vampires again.

ESTELLE

Stop him. It's morning. The

sunlight. Stop him.

LOUIS

You didn't even warm them, did you?

ARMAND

No.

LOUIS

And yet you knew what I would do.

ARMAND

I knew. I rescued you, didn't I?

From the terrible dawn.

LOUIS

You were their leader. They trusted

you.

ARMAND

You made me see their failings,

Louis. You made me look at them

with your eyes.

ARMAND

Your melancholy eyes...

LOUIS

What a pair we are. We deserve each

other, don't we?

ARMAND

We are a pair, and that's what

counts.

LOUIS (V.O.)

We left Paris shortly after. For

years we wandered. Greece, Egypt,

all the ancient lands. Then, out of

curiosity, perhaps, boredom, who

knows what, I took him home, to my

America...

LOUIS (V.O.)

And there, a technological wonder

allowed me see sunrise, for the

first time in two hundred years...

LOUIS (V.O.)

And what sunrises! Seen as the

human eye could never see them. We

would sit in the dark, night after

night among nameless humans,

entranced with the miracle of

light. Silver at first, then as the

years progressed in tones of

purple, red and my long-lost

blue...

LOUIS (V.O.)

And in time parted. We had become

so alike, we both wanted the

certainties of loneliness once

more.

LOUIS (V.O.)

I had returned to new Orleans. As

soon as I smelt the air, I knew I

was home. There was sadness there,

rich, almost sweet, like the

fragrance of jasmine. I walked the

streets, savoring it like a long

lost perfume...

LOUIS (V.O.)

And then on Prytania Street, only

blocks from the Lafayette cemetery

I caught the scent of death and it

wasn't coming from the graves...

LOUIS (V.O.)

The scent grew stronger as I

walked. Old death. A scent too

faint for mortals to detect.

LOUIS (V.O.)

They were like the doomed princess

caught in the thorny vines of

Sleeping Beauty's castle. I knew

what it meant. A vampire had lured

them here, but had been to weak to

get rid of them.

LOUIS (V.O.)

It spelt weakness, madness, the

behavior of a dying animal that

pollutes its own lair.

MALLOY (V.O.)

Lestat escaped the fire!

LOUIS (V.O.)

He hadn't even been there. And all

those years I thought he was dead.

LESTAT

I'm so glad you're here Louis...

I've dreamed of your coming...

LOUIS

Don't try to speak... it's

alright...

LESTAT

I didn't mean to let them do it...

that Santiago, he tricked me...

LOUIS

That's all past, Lestat.

LESTAT

Yes. Past... she should never have

been one of us...

LESTAT

Still beautiful Louis. You always

were the strong one.

LOUIS

Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you

no harm.

LESTAT

You've come back to me, Louis?

You've come again to me?

LOUIS

It's only a siren...

LESTAT

I can't bear it Louis! The machines

out there, that fly and that roar!

And such lights! They make the

night brighter than the day!

LOUIS

And they frighten you?

LESTAT

You know I love the dark. But

there's no dark anymore.

LOUIS

It's false light, Lestat. It can't

harm you...

LESTAT

If you stayed with me Louis, I

could venture out... little by

little... become the old Lestat.

LOUIS

I have to go now Lestat...

LESTAT

You remember how I was, Louis.. the

vampire Lestat...

LOUIS

Yes. I remember...

LESTAT

I tried to tell you Louis... that

night in Paris... when I first came

to you... no-one can refuse the

dark gift, Louis... not even you.

LOUIS

I tried...

LESTAT

And the more you tried, the more I

wanted you... a vampire with your

beautiful, suffering human heart.

And how you suffered... I need your

forgiveness, Louis.

LOUIS

You have it...

LESTAT

You'll come back, Louis... take me

out... little by little... and

maybe I'll be myself again...

LOUIS

(whispering)

Yes, Lestat...

LOUIS (V.O.)

And my story ends there. But in

fact it ended a long time ago, with

Claudia's ashes in that theatre. My

love died with her. I never really

changed after that. What became of

Lestat I have no idea. I go on,

night after night. I feed on those

who cross my path. But all my

passion went with her yellow hair.

I ma a spirit with preternatural

flesh. Detached. unchangeable.

Empty.

MALLOY

No... it can't end like that...

LOUIS

But it has. There is no more to

tell.

MALLOY

But you talk about passion, about

longing, about things I'll never

know in my life! It's still inside

you, in every syllable you speak!

And then you tell me it ends like

that? Just empty?

LOUIS

It's over, I'm telling you...

MALLOY

You need a new passion, Louis, a

new reason to feel... what a story

you've told, you don't understand

yourself.

LOUIS

Do what you want with it. Learn

what you can. Give the story to

others.

MALLOY

You have another chance, Louis.

Take me! Give me your gift, your

power...

LOUIS

Is this what you want? You ask me

for this after all I've told you?

MALLOY

If I could see what you've seen,

feel what you've felt I wouldn't

let it end like this! You need a

like to the world out there, a

connection... then it won't end

like this...

MALLOY

You need me.

LOUIS

Dear God. I've failed again,

haven't I?

MALLOY

No...

LOUIS

Don't say anymore. The reels are

still turning. I have but one

chance to show you the meaning of

what I've said.

LOUIS

You like it? You like being food

for the immortals? You like dying?

Is it beautiful? Is it intense?

MALLOY

No... please...

LOUIS

Thank God.

MALLOY

Louis... Louis...

MALLOY

Holy shit...

MALLOY

Jesus...

LOUIS (V.O.)

(tape)

1791. That's when it happened. I

was twenty-four. Younger then you

are now.

LOUIS (V.O.)

(tape)

My invitation was open to anyone.

Sailors, whores, thieves. But it

was a vampire that accepted...

LESTAT

Dear Louis... will I ever forget?

FADE OUT
